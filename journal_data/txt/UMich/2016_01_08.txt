University 

researchers lauded 
for work in science 

and energy

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

While developments in science 

and technology often appear in 
news headlines or take place in 
a lab seemingly a world away, 
many examples of innovation 
can also be seen here on campus. 
Two members of the University 
community were recognized for 
their contributions to the science 
community in the Forbes 30 Under 
30 List earlier this week, both with 
somewhat unorthodox paths to 
their accomplishments.

Matt Gaidica

The brain may not differ too 

greatly from an electrical circuit, 
according to Rackham student 
Matt Gaidica, a neuroscience Ph.D. 
candidate. 
Gaidica’s 
previous 

formal education in electrical 
engineering inspired him to view 
the brain in a new light, guiding his 
current study in neuroscience.

Surrounded 
by 
companies 

like Google and Apple in the hills 
of San Francisco, Gaidica and 
his best friend quickly joined 
the innovative startup culture 
associated with the Bay Area. 

After receiving an undergraduate 
degree in electrical engineering 
from Kettering University, Gaidica 
co-founded 
a 
small 
software 

company called Landr, which 
developed an application that 
altered media to make it work 
on all devices. Through this 
experience, he gained experience 
in image analysis and software, 
as 
the 
application 
pioneered 

innovative techniques for viewing 
media on mobile devices. He and 
his partner took the business to 
Silicon Valley, where it evolved 
into a technology that is now built 
into other products used by CNN, 
Craigslist, Airbnb, NHL and the 
U.S. Army.

Following the sale of Landr, 

Gaidica began working on another 
startup — Syllabuster — which 
focused on providing students 
with more information about 
their courses and connections 
within the class. However, Gaidica 
resigned 
shortly 
after 
from 

Syllabuster due to feeling like he 
wasn’t contributing to society in a 
way he wanted.

With the Pacific Ocean and 

rising mountains growing smaller 
in his rearview mirror, Gaidica 
drove back to Michigan to begin 
the next chapter of his life. As 
an electrical engineer and coder, 
he shifted gears, pondering the 
functions of a kind of circuit that 
existed before the development of 

‘U’ study finds 

financial burden can 
impact treatment 

effectiveness

By ALEXA ST. JOHN 

Daily Staff Reporter

Only 55 percent of patients 

employed at the time of a 
medical diagnosis kept their 
jobs after treatment ended, 
according to the survey of 
cancer patients conducted by 
University reserachers.

The study, funded by the 

American 
Cancer 
Society, 

found that those who had paid 
sick leave during treatment 
were almost twice as likely 
to keep their jobs than those 
without paid sick leave. The 
study focused on more than 
1,300 patients with stage three 
colorectal cancer, or cancer of 
the colon or rectum.

Ultimately, 
the 
study 

concluded 
that 
the 
overall 

financial burden for cancer 
patients is greater for those 
working 
without 
paid 
sick 

leave.

Surgery 
Professor 
Scott 

Regenbogen, a co-author of the 
study, said the most important 

finding of the study was that 
a patient’s ability to retain 
their jobs and avoid personal 
financial 
burden 
during 

treatment was closely related to 
the availability of job benefits.

“We know that both of those 

things — retaining a job and 
avoiding financial burden — are 
also predictive of their ability 
to 
complete 
their 
therapy 

successfully, 
and 
the 
best 

outcome from that therapy,” 
Regenbogen said.

Christine Veenstra, clinical 

lecturer in Internal Medicine 
and 
another 
co-author 
of 

the study, said for working 
patients, a cancer diagnosis 
and subsequent treatment can 
cause an additional burden of 
having to take time off of work, 
resulting in lost income or 
employment.

“We 
hypothesized 
that 

paid sick leave might reduce 
patients’ need to take unpaid 
time off of work while they are 
getting cancer treatment and 
might also help them retain 
their jobs and reduce the 
financial burden that they face 
when they’re going through the 
cancer treatment,” she said.

About 39 percent of American 

workers do not have access to 
paid sick leave, according to

In an effort to expand science, 

technology, 
engineering, 

mathematics and business degrees, 
as well as promote diversity, 
the General Motors Foundation 
awarded the University a $230,000 
grant in December.

Jackie Parker, president of the 

GM Foundation and director of GM 
Global Philanthropy and Corporate 
Giving, 
wrote 
in 
an 
e-mail 

interview that the University was 
chosen because of the high quality 
of its STEM programs.

The Ross School of Business 

was ranked by U.S. News as the 
fourth best undergraduate business 
school in the nation, and the 
College of Engineering ranks sixth. 
Rankings for science and math are

talk firearm laws 
and safety, health 

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

On Monday, President Barack 

Obamaannounced 
a 
series 

of executive actions that will 
close loopholes in existing gun 
regulation, moving beyond what 

many state’s laws, including those 
in Michigan, enforce.

Under the executive action, 

proxy-business 
private 
sellers 

now must use background checks 
before selling firearms.

The original clause allowing 

those sellers to skip background 
checks 
was 
intended 
for 

individuals who are not selling 
guns as a business and only sell 
a few times in their lifetimes, 
but it has since been used by 
many groups of for-profit sellers 
using proxy-businesses, such as 
individuals who sell firearms at 

gun shows.

The move was criticized by 

several prominent gun rights 
groups on the grounds that it 
encroached on their rights. In a 
statement Monday, Chris Cox, 
executive director of the National 
Rifle Association’s Institute for 
Legislative Action, said the action 
harassed and intimidated gun 
owners.

“The 
timing 
of 
this 

announcement, in the eighth 
and final year of his presidency, 
demonstrates not only political 
exploitation but a fundamental 

lack of seriousness,” the statement 
read. “The proposed executive 
actions are ripe for abuse by the 
Obama Administration, which 
has made no secret of its contempt 
for the Second Amendment.”

Law Prof. Julian Mortenson 

said criticisms that the action 
infringes on Second Amendment 
rights are misfounded due to the 
Supreme Court case District of 
Columbia v. Heller. Heller upheld 
Second Amendment rights for 
individual owners, but included a 
clause limiting the use of firearms

The Ann Arbor District 

Library hosted the first of 
four planned public forums 
focusing 
on 
sustainability 

measures taken by the city 
and the University Thursday 
evening.

The forum, titled “Climate 

and

Anya Dale, Nathan Geisler, the 
Ann Arbor Energy Programs 
Analyst, 
Wayne 
Appleyard, 

chair of the Ann Arbor Energy 
Commission and Sean Reed, 
Executive 
Director 
of 
the

Mike 
Garfield, 
executive 

director of the Ecology Center, 
introduced 
the 
forum 
by 

detailing the history of climate 
change activism in the country 
and the political challenges 
that scientists and proponents 
of clean energy have faced.

“But in the last five to six 

years, 
something 
else 
has 

begun to happen and it gives 

me a lot of hope,” he said. 
“First, very slowly and then 
increasingly 
fast, 
ordinary 

people 
around 
the 
world 

have stood up and demanded 
action.”

Garfield 
said 
the 

development 
of 
local

by felons and the mentally ill, two 
aspects that background checks 
are used to flag. 

“It’s not a serious argument 

under current Supreme Court 
doctrine,” he said. “The idea that 
background checks would be 
anything other than a reasonable 
technical method of achieving 
what the Supreme Court has 
basically said is perfectly fine is 
too much to swallow. I would not 
want to be the lawyer who had to 
argue that case.”

Looking 
to 
the 
state 
of 

Michigan, state Rep. Jeff Irwin 
(D–Ann Arbor) said Michigan 
state law does little to expand 
on federal law in terms of gun 
control, though multiple bills have 
been introduced over past years to 
change that.

He pointed specifically to the 

inclusion of the right to own a gun 
in the state constitution.

“Michigan is one of many states 

that has not taken any opportunity 
to go further than the federal 
regulations,” he said. “Michigan 
also has a constitutional provision 
referencing gun rights. It has 
language that basically says you 
have the right to own a gun in a 
way that is more straightforward 
than in the U.S. Constitution.”

In May, Irwin co-sponsored 

House Bill 4590, which would take 
a step beyond the executive action 
and require universal background 
checks for all firearm purchases.

The bill was first introduced in 

2011 and has subsequently been 
introduced each year following, 
but has not been brought to a vote. 
The legislation aims to ensure 
firearm transactions are done 
with background checks in order 
to increase public safety.

“That’s the kind of thing that 

needs to happen at the state level,” 
Irwin said. “We need to close 
the loophole and make sure as 
many sales as possible are being 
performed with a background 
check so we keep guns out of the 
hands of violent criminals.”

Public 
Health 
Prof. 
Marc 

Zimmerman 
said 
the 
issue 

surrounding gun control should 
not be viewed as a rights issue, but 
a public safety one.

“The more we talk about guns as 

public safety the more reasonable 
we can all be,” he said. “As a public 
health professor, anything we can 
do to prevent injury whether it’s 
a fall from snow or shooting from 
guns, I think it’s a good thing, 
and I don’t think this infringes on 
people’s rights.”

Irwin said background checks 

are one of the best ways to improve 
public safety and that the majority 
of Americans support universal 
background checks. An October 
CBS/New York Times poll found 
that 92 percent of Americans 
support background checks on all 
buyers.

“This is an idea that Democrats 

in general and myself have been 
talking about for years,” Irwin 
said. “This is the simplest, easiest 
thing we can do to increase safety 
in a way that almost all Americans 
agree with.”

Impact of Asian carp on Great 
Lakes could be overestimated

Using a computer 
model, researchers 
find new population 

predictions

By MEGAN DOYLE

Daily Staff Reporter

For many years, experts have 

investigated the effects of inva-
sive species on the Great Lakes. 
However, using a new computer 
model, University researchers have 
discovered new information that 
shows the impact of Asian Carp in 
Lake Erie could have previously 
been overestimated. 

According to the new findings, 

a few species of fish would see a 
population increase in response 
to the influx of Asian carp, includ-
ing smallmouth bass. Others could 
see a decrease of up to 37 percent, 
which is lower than the decrease 
in native fish population that some 
experts have previously predicted.

The new study, conducted 

by Hongyan Zhang, assistant 
research scientist at the School 
of Natural Resources and Envi-
ronment, along with professors 
from other universities across the 
nation, primarily focused on aid-
ing water quality management in 
the Great Lakes. The team also 
included researchers from the 
U.S. Forest Service, Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada and the Ontario 
Ministry of Natural Resources 
and Forestry.

The plankton-eating Asian carp 

are not currently present in Lake 
Erie, though they are established in 
watersheds near the Great Lakes, 
creating interest for such research.

“We found that the Asian carp, 

if they come into the Great Lakes, 
into Lake Erie, they could be very 
abundant,” Zhang said. “They 
could become one-third of the total 
fish weight. That is quite a lot.”

If they were to successfully 

invade Lake Erie, Asian carp would 
likely affect the food web in two 
regards: The carp would likely 

compete with native fish by eat-
ing plankton, the food source for 
both native fish and the carp, and 
native fish could potentially feed on 
younger Asian carp if they became 
a part of the lake’s ecosystem.

Scientific predictions of the 

impact of Asian carp on the Great 
Lakes differ. Some experts say they 
would decimate the fish popula-
tions and food webs, similar to their 
effect on the Illinois River, where 
Asian carp have become a large 
part of the ecosystem. 

Other experts argue that the 

Great Lakes are an unsuitable habi-
tat for Asian carp, so the effects 
of introducing the fish would be 
minimal. This new study falls in 
between these two predictions.

“Compared to what happened 

in the Illinois River, where more 
than 80 percent of the fish is Asian 
carp in that area, the percentage is 
not very high for Lake Erie,” Zhang 
said. “But it is a big lake, and it has 
a lot of fish, more than the other 
Great Lakes, and if one-third of the 
fish population will be Asian carp, 
that is very abundant. The impact 
on the population is to decrease 
most of the fish species. That is not 
a good thing.”

This project is the first to use a 

food-web model to examine the 
effects of Asian carp in Lake Erie. 
The team of researchers inter-
viewed 11 experts on Asian carp 
and Great Lakes ecology. They then 
incorporated their predictions into 
a computerized model projecting 
the effect of the Asian carp. The 
experts were then asked to indicate 
their level of uncertainty with each 
statement they provided, and this 
was included in the model as a mar-
gin of error.

Ed Rutherford, a co-author of 

the study and a research fishery 
biologist at the NOAA Great Lakes 
Environmental Research Labora-
tory, said the unique methodology 
of their research was instrumental 
in addressing the issue.

“What was interesting to me was 

that with our model, we were able 
to put numbers to the estimates 
about the impact of Asian carp,” 
Rutherford said. “So we were able 
to fill in knowledge gaps of exactly

Sigma Alpha Mu leaders opt to 
take plea deals in criminal cases

Kaplan, Levin 

charged with giving 
alcohol to minors

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

Two former leaders of the Uni-

versity’s now-disbanded frater-
nity, Sigma Alpha Mu, will enter 
pleas in a case pertaining to last 
year’s ski trip vandalism at Tree-
tops Resorts, according to the 
Gaylord Herald Times.

Joshua Kaplan and Zach-

ary Levin — former president and 
treasurer of SAM, respectively — 
both face one count each of pro-
viding alcohol to minors over the 
incident.

According 
to 
the 
Herald-

Times, Otsego County Prosecutor 
Michael Rola received an e-mail 
Tuesday from the defense coun-
sel for Kaplan and Levin indicat-
ing that both would sign a plea 
agreement.

Criminal charges have also 

been leveled against four other 
SAM members over the incident. 
Treetops has also brought a civil 
suit against multiple members of 
the fraternity, citing the damage 
done to the resort and alleged lack 
of cooperation at the time from 
members of the fraternity pres-
ent. 

The incident additionally led 

University President Mark Schlis-
sel to ban SAM from campus for at 
least four years in February.

During 
the 
January 
2015 

weekend trip, SAM and a Uni-
versity sorority, Sigma Delta Tau, 
caused an estimated $430,000 in 
damage, according to the resort. 
Treetops has alleged that the stu-
dents intentionally inflicted dam-
age and did not cooperate with 
the resort’s efforts to halt it. The 
amount of damage stems from 
$234,000 in property damage and 
an estimated $250,000 from busi-
ness interruptions, as estimated 
by Treetops accountants. The 
vandalism included destroying 

ceiling tiles and exit signs, break-
ing furniture and urinating on 
carpets.

Other former fraternity mem-

bers who been sentenced in the 
case include Mathew Vlasic, Jesse 
Krumholz and Daniel Orleans.

Vlasic and Krumholz received 

misdemeanor charges for mali-
cious destruction of a building, 
and Orleans was sentenced with 
a charge of malicious destruction 
of property less than $200. All 
received two years of probation, 
$5,000 in restitution, various 
fees and 100 community service 
hours.

By accepting pleas, Kaplan and 

Levin will avoid a trial originally 
scheduled for Jan. 13. Their sen-
tencing will now be scheduled for 
a future date.

The misdemeanor charge fac-

ing the two carries up to 30 days 
in jail or a $1,000 fine, though 
in each of the previous cases for 
SAM members, the court has 
chosen to levy probation, fees and 
community services instead.

today’s high-tech innovations: 
the brain.

“I wasn’t solving the world’s 

problems, and I wanted to be 
closer,” Gaidica said. “I had 
talked about the brain much 
before at this TEDxFlint talk, 
and it makes a lot of sense for an 
electrical engineer. The brain 
runs on electricity, and so it kind 
of just became this problem that 
I really wanted to get into.”

Gaidica spent the next year 

traveling and writing a book 
about our brain’s asymmetries, 
“Left: 
A 
History 
of 
the 

Hemispheres.” In his research, 
he documented the history and 
science of the left and right sides 
of the brain and explored the 
question of why individuals are 
right- or left-handed.

“This is a really interesting 

question, not only in humans, but 
through evolution,” Gaidica said. 
“It’s really kind of a mysterious 
thing.”

Though 
Gaidica 
has 
a 

background 
in 
engineering, 

image 
processing, 
software 

and hardware, he said studying 
brain asymmetries allowed him 
to begin using an engineering 
approach to study neuroscience.

Despite his unconventional 

path to the subject, Gaidica is 
currently pursuing a Ph.D. in 
neuroscience 
and 
conducts 

Parkinson’s disease research at 
the University, also working as 
a graduate student instructor. 
Gaidica uses his coding and 
engineering skills to design 
3D printed devices and circuit 
boards, as well as write software 
to analyze the data coming out 
of brain imaging and neural 
recordings.

“If we can understand the 

circuit behind it and what’s 
changing in the circuit, that then 
leads us to the therapies and the 
drugs, and the interventions, the 
surgeries,” Gaidica said.

Forbes described Gaidica’s 

path as “eclectic,” recognizing 
his hard work and diverse 
achievements. 
Though 
he 

appreciated the praise, Gaidica 
emphasized it just means he 
has to continue working hard to 
prove himself worthy.

“These recognitions are great, 

and they’re useful tools to help 
motivate you,” Gaidica said. 
“But it doesn’t make the work 
any easier. It doesn’t change the 
number of hours that you have to 
put in, and that’s the stuff that I 
enjoy.”

Andrej Lenert

Inspired by the efficient use 

of solar energy, postdoctoral 
research fellow Andrej Lenert is 
working to explore clean energy.

Lenert attended the University 

of Iowa as an undergraduate, 
receiving a degree in mechanical 
engineering. 
Following 

graduation, he then went on to 
obtain a master’s degree and 
Ph.D. in mechanical engineering 
at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology. Although he 
launched 
his 
educational 

career with a more traditional 
mechanical 
engineering 

curriculum, he said the program 
became more interdisciplinary 
as he continued his graduate 
studies.

Currently, 
Lenert 
is 
a 

postdoctoral researcher at the 
University, working with the 
Nanoscale Transport Lab. There, 
he studies energy transport 
across small-length scales and 
materials with structures on the 
nanometer scale.

The research he conducted for 

his Ph.D. paved the way for his 
work at the University. At MIT, 
part of his research focused on 
combining solar-thermal and 
photovoltaic systems to reduce 
waste.

“I really kind of identified the 

biggest bottleneck in terms of 
efficiency in that technology,” 
Lenert said. “And that was 
conversion of heat as thermal 
radiation into electricity.

As a student, Lenert found 

himself 
drawn 
to 
topics 

involving 
energy, 
utilization 

and environmental engineering. 
He 
said 
his 
motivation 
to 

pursue mechanical engineering 
stemmed from his interests in 
solving problems related to clean 
energy.

Noting 
the 
importance 

of 
clean 
energy 
and 
the 

contemporary 
challenges 
of 

global warming, he said the 
most fascinating aspect of clean 
energy is the way it bridges 
complex and interdisciplinary 
topics in science.

“It starts off with the solar 

system. How we get sunlight 
as our natural resource really 
depends on the solar system and 
the nature of our earth rotating,” 
Lenert said. “And the length-
scales shrink all the way down 
to the atomic level where we’re 
trying to engineer materials that 
have new properties or have 
new functionality. Then, there’s 
everything in between.”

Lenert is now applying to 

faculty positions, hoping to 
mentor aspiring scientists and 
continue to contribute to the 
science community through his 
research and discoveries.

a 2015 news release from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Though paid sick leave could 

help protect workers financially 
should they develop a serious 
illness, 
Veenstra 
noted 
that 

paid sick leave is not mandatory 
under the Affordable Care Act 
or the Family Medical Leave 
Act, though access to benefits 
differ among some occupational 
groups.

She 
also 
said 
researchers 

found 
patients 
without 
paid 

sick leave hold a much higher 
personal financial burden than 
those with that benefit, even 
when controlling for factors such 
as the patient’s income, education 
level and health insurance.

To determine what constitutes 

a financial burden, the study 
considered 
factors 
such 
as 

whether the patient had to 
borrow money, had difficulties 
paying off their credit cards 
or had to reduce spending on 
necessities and luxuries.

Veenstra said it was not just 

the fact that patients retained 
their jobs that led to the reduced 
financial burden; rather, it was 
crucial that patients maintained 
an 
income 
during 
cancer 

treatment even if they needed 
time away from work.

While the colorectal cancer 

is an ideal model to look at 
the impact of paid sick leave 
on employment and financial 
outcomes for cancer patients 
— due to being one of the most 
common cancers among men 
and women — Veenstra said the 
study’s findings would apply to 
patients with other cancers. 

She added that she and the 

other authors of this study plan to 
further their research by looking 
into and how other job support 
benefits aside from paid sick 
leave impact patients’ long-term 
financial burden.

“What we are hoping to 

find out in our other studies 
is whether there are other job 
support benefits like disability or 
extended time off or other things 
like that,” she said. “They may be 
helpful to alleviate some of the 
burden that cancer patients face.”

Regenbogen said job benefits 

that aid patients with cancer 
in 
receiving 
appropriate 

chemotherapy would not only 
have 
significant 
financial 

improvements for patients, but 
could also improve their clinical 
outcomes.

He added that said policy 

advocacy — specifically, arguing 
in favor of more availability for 
job benefits — and understanding 
how 
cancer 
therapies 
are 

designed could also help patients 
with long-term illnesses.

“Patients face a trade-off to 

complete their therapy and their 
ability to support their families,” 
Regenbogen 
said. 
“Time 
off 

without pay may not really be 
time off at all for a patient who 
cannot afford to take that time 
off. For a lot of patients, there 
really is a clear trade-off between 
ability to complete therapy and 
ability to support their families. 
I think a lot of patients end 
up choosing to complete their 
therapy, but at real harm to their 
financial well-being.”

wrote. “While we evaluate many 
factors, this grant was awarded 
to U of M on the basis of the 
school’s excellence in STEM and 
in preparing students for careers 
of the future.”

The grant will fund a variety 

of programs within the College of 
Engineering and the Ross School 
of Business, specifically funding 
programs that promote minority 
groups in STEM fields such as the 
Center for Engineering Diversity 
and Outreach and the BBA Black 
Business Students Association.

In an interview with the Daily, 

Dean 
of 
Engineering 
David 

Munson said GM has had a long 
standing relationship with the 
University.

“GM has been a longtime 

supporter of our programs in 
engineering and the University 
overall,” Munson said. “We have 
a big research partnership with 
them and in addition they support 
other aspects of our programs.”

Parker echoed this sentiment, 

citing the ways GM’s relationship 
with the University extends 
beyond this grant.

“Our partnership with the 

University of Michigan runs 
deep,” she wrote. “Not only do we 
actively employ UM graduates, 
but we remain a dedicated partner 
in research and development and 
in advancing education through 
hundreds of thousands of dollars 
in grants over the years.”

Munson said one of the 

primary programs that will 
receive 
funding 
from 
this 

grant will be the Center for 
Engineering 
Diversity 
and 

Outreach, 
which 
supports 

minority students within the 
College of Engineering.

“CEDO has many different 

programs,” 
he 
said. 
“They 

work on making a welcoming 

climate 
for 
underrepresented 

minority students. They work 
on summer camps for students. 
They are involved in helping 
create 
academic 
success 
for 

underrepresented 
minority 

students.”

Promoting STEM education 

within 
minority 
groups 
is 

important, 
Munson 
added, 

because for the country to remain 
competitive in those fields, non-
white males will need to make up 
a more significant portion of the 
engineering workforce.

“People realize that within 

just a few decades the current 
minority in the country is going 
to become the majority,” Munson 
said. “If we get to that point in 
time and we are drawing all 
of our engineering talent from 
what used to be the majority, 
predominantly from white males, 
then we are not going to remain 
economically competitive.”

Both Parker and Munson 

said the industry’s future will 
be improved if today’s minority 
students are better supported in 
the STEM fields, such as through 
grants like this one.

“Encouraging 
minority 

students to study STEM fuels the 
workforce pipeline with educated 
graduates that are prepared to 
compete in a global industry,” 
Parker wrote.

U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell 

(D–Dearborn) 
tweeted 
after 

the announcement to laud the 
University for winning the grant

Munson said Dingell is right 

— the grant will increase the 
number of students who graduate 
with STEM degrees.

“Whether 
you’re 
an 

unrepresented minority student 
or a woman student, I think you 
are probably at a little bit of a 
disadvantage,” he said. “These 
students are looking around the 
room and feeling out of place and 
may be underestimating their 
abilities.

form 
of 
mechanisms 
such 

as the city’s Climate Action 
Plan. Ann Arbor City Council 
unanimously passed the plan 
in 2012, with over 80 steps to 
reduce the city’s cumulative gas 
emissions by 25 percent by 2025 
and 90 percent by 2050.

“Our plan, in spirit and in 

content, is consistent with the 
aims of the Paris agreement,” 
Geisler said. “The plan does not 
and could not articulate, from 
2025 to 2050, how exactly we 
get there. But there’s a lot of big 
things that have to happen not 
only in the city but also, more 
broadly, throughout the state.”

On the federal level, in 

August 2015 President Barack 
Obama and the Environmental 
Protection Agency introduced 
the 
Clean 
Energy 
Plan, 

which aims to reduce carbon 
emissions from power plants 
by 32 percent by 2030 based on 
levels in 2005.

Geisler said he expects the 

CEP will have a significant 
impact on the CAP’s goals. The 
city experienced an increase 
in overall emissions between 
2010 and 2015 and called for a 
community effort to improve 
clean 
energy, 
according 
to 

Geisler.

“Over 
98 
percent 
of 

emissions in Ann Arbor and 
community-wide are beyond 
the control of the municipality, 
so we really need a community-
wide effort to raise awareness 
and build the kind of support 
that’s necessary to make sure 
that we’re doing our part in 
helping to meet these goals,” 
he said. “There will possibly 
be an improvement, though we 
don’t have all the data yet and 
we don’t think we’ll see a large 
increase, community-wide, in 
overall reduction.”

The forum also touched on 

international efforts, namely 
the 
December 
2015 
United 

Nations 
Climate 
Change 

Conference 
in 
Paris. 
The 

195 
nations 
who 
attended 

conference, including the U.S., 
adopted 
several 
measures 

that would decrease carbon 
emissions in their respective 
countries.

“I would suggest this mostly 

happened because people have 
started to seriously mobilize,” 
Garfield said. “However, while 
the Paris commitments are 
substantially verifiable, they 
are neither enforceable nor 
sufficient. I’d suggest here that 
we’ll only succeed in stabilizing 
global temperatures if people 
continue to mobilize and if local 
communities continue to act on 
their own.”

In terms of the University — 

which currently accounts for 
30 percent of the city’s carbon 
emissions — Dale highlighted 
recent policies and goals aimed 
at promoting sustainability on 
campus.

She said one of the biggest 

goals the University has set, in 
compliance with the Climate 
Action 
Plan, 
is 
to 
reduce 

greenhouse gas emissions by 25 
percent of what it was in 2006 
by 2025.

“Unfortunately, in 2014 we 

were a little bit higher than we 
were in 2006 and that is largely 
because of the way the goal was 
set,” she said. “The goal does 
not factor in how we’ve grown 
as a university. Our energy use 
is going down, but we keep 
growing and growing. Overall, 
our usage is not decreasing as 
we would like to see.”

Some 
further 
actions 

that 
will 
be 
implemented 

by 
the 
University, 
Dale 

said, 
are 
expanding 
the 

use of cogeneration at the 
University’s 
central 
power 

plant, 
establishing 
a 
fund 

for 
renewable 
energy 

demonstration 
projects, 

expanding 
current 
energy 

reduction 
programs 
such 

as 
Planet 
Blue 
Energy 

Management 
and 
seeking 

additional 
methods 
for 

greenhouse gas emissions.

what would happen if Asian carp is 
introduced to the Great Lakes.”

Overall, the increase in species 

could be minimal, Rutherford said. 
In terms of a decline, most fish spe-
cies, including walleye, rainbow 
trout, gizzard shad and emerald 
shiner, could be affected according 
to the study, from 25 percent for 
most fish species, to 37 percent for a 
few plankton-eating species.

“Although the decrease is not 

as bad as other people thought, or 
compared to what happened in the 
Illinois River, it is not that bad — but 
still, it is a very bad thing, especially 
for the sport and commercial fish 
species,” Zhang said.

The same research team is now 

working to expand their research to 
predict the impact of Asian carp in 
the other Great Lakes, such as Lake 
Michigan, Lake Huron and Lake 
Ontario. They are also working on 
a study of the regional economic 
impacts stemming from Asian carp 
in Lake Erie.

T

he old adage states that in polite 
conversation, there are three things 
you are not to discuss: money, religion 

and politics. And it makes 
sense. No one wants to 
know how much is in 
your bank account or who 
around the dinner table 
you think is going to hell. 
But here and now, I’m 
calling for a referendum 
on part three. The simple 
fact of the matter is that 
political discourse, in all 
its shapes and sizes, is too 
important to be stifled for 
the sake of civility.

In the aftermath of the holiday season, 

everyone can look back and cringe at some 
comment made at a family meal. A simple 
Google search reveals hundreds of tips and 
tricks to endure usually ranting, possibly rac-
ist and often over-served relatives around the 
Thanksgiving table. And that is the general 
image of politics at family gatherings: biting 
one’s tongue, knowing that if you allow your 
opinion to burst forth it will end with someone 
storming off into the living room, offended. 
So you keep quiet and let it go. Next time, try 
speaking up.

As a student at a large liberal university, it’s 

not every day that I come across someone with 
whom I disagree. I may be challenged by dif-
ferent approaches or the intricacies of a posi-
tion that is not my own. But for the most part, I 
am surrounded by those who care about simi-
lar issues, who take similar stances and who 
will inevitably vote in a similar way as I will in 
the next election, and our conversations will 
generally fall under the blanket of liberalism. 
Walk into any library and count the number 
of Bernie stickers that have colonized laptops, 
water bottles and backpacks. So when my uncle 
at Christmas attempts to explain to me why 
he’s voting for Donald Trump, I don’t pass up 
the rare opportunity for debate.

Though I refuse to accept the validity of the 

contemporary image of college-going millen-
nials as thin-skinned, frivolous and too quick 
to protest, I will accept one critique of my gen-
eration: we’re sheltered. Through social media 
and conversation with the people I speak to on 
a daily basis, the greater majority of my politi-
cal positions remain unchallenged. I have con-
servative friends, of course, but as I’m writing 
this, I’m struggling to name more than five. 
And through this bastion of liberalism I’ve 
found among my peers, I miss out on opportu-
nities for otherwise valuable in-depth discus-
sion. Roundtable discussions of young liberals 
agreeing with other young liberals can only 
last so long. Going home and interacting with 
parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles from 
different generations and all over the country 
offers me invaluable exposure to a wider range 
of political thinking that I would otherwise 
scroll past on my Facebook feed or laugh at 
through the intermediary John Oliver or Ste-
phen Colbert.

Talking through it all, persuading my uncle 

to support another candidate — really any can-
didate other than Trump — makes a difference 
in the long run. My uncle may not get up from 
the table with a changed mind, but who knows? 
Maybe something I said will resonate with him 
months down the road, or maybe his mind will 
never change. Regardless, this conversation 
forced me to vocalize my dissent, fleshing out 
the specifics of why and how I disagree with 
Donald Trump, rather than dismissing him as I 
would on any given day in my dorm room.

Important to note as well is the fact that 

these exchanges operate in both directions. 
As much as I learn from having my ideas chal-
lenged and molded by family and friends with 
whom I disagree, their positions inevitably 
evolve as well (though they may not always 
let you see it). Just as my aunt explained to me 
why my generation is perceived as “crybabies” 
in our never-ending quest for inclusiveness, I’d 
like to think that my explanation of cultural 
appropriation and its importance left some sort 
of impression on her.

For example, I will never vote for Don-

ald Trump. It’s pretty much a physical law of 
the universe, like gravity or 1+1=2. However, 
through conversation with my uncle I have 
begun to understand substantially more about 
his appeal and why his supporters are flock-
ing to the idea of making America great again. 
The simple fact of the matter is that he cannot 
be bought, he speaks his mind and he’s about 
as far as it gets from the lackluster, ineffec-
tive politicians to which American voters are 
accustomed. On any given day in Ann Arbor, 
however, I would attribute Trump’s popular-
ity to an effective use of fear-mongering and 
a misguided crusade against the “evil” that is 
political correctness. But there’s more to the 
Republican frontrunner, and I know that now.

For 19 years, I have been lucky enough to be 

surrounded by stubborn relatives who don’t 
care about what is “polite conversation” and 
who are willing to speak their minds. Dis-
cussing politics around the Thanksgiving and 
Christmas tables has helped me formulate my 
own ideological identity. The idea that this 
practice is something that should somehow be 
avoided, muted or excluded is absurd to me.

2016 is set to be a maelstrom of political 

activity. Frontrunners in the presidential race 
include a reality TV star, a socialist and a for-
mer first lady whose unfavorables remain mys-
teriously high. Immigration, foreign policy, 
race and the relationship between our govern-
ment and its people will be points of constant 
contention. So make a belated New Year’s 
Resolution. Don’t shy away from political dis-
cussion because it is somehow “impolite.” Take 
advantage of the opportunity to engage others, 
and, as millennials in our first-ever presiden-
tial election, make our voices heard. Because in 
the long run, it’s really not that impolite. And 
the discourse is simply too valuable to pass up.

Politics in polite conversation

Activism by necessity

I 
 

cannot pinpoint the exact 
moment when my obsession 
with politics began. There 

was 
no 
real 

draw for me 
to begin with; 
my 
parents 

never 
took 

me to rallies 
or 
conducted 
fervent 
political 

discussions at the dinner table. I 
vaguely recall watching the 2004 
election on TV with an inexplicable 
affinity for John Kerry, though my 
knowledge of the party system was 
finite and his policies were beyond 
my 8¬year¬old realm of expertise. 
Most of my childhood was steeped 
in an unconscious apathy for the 
outside world, resulting in a limited 
perspective of my country and its 
systemic inner-workings. 

I guess it really began in high 

school, when I realized that every 
aspect of society is shaped in some 
way by the political process. It was 
a line of skeptical questioning that 
led me to this conclusion. I had just 
transferred, by my own accord, 
from my school district of 11 years 
to a more affluent district located 
20 minutes from my home. The 
difference in culture was enough 
to launch me into a state of utter 
astonishment — these kids actually 
wanted to learn, and intelligence 
was admired, even considered cool. 
Why wasn’t that the case before?

The answer was, as it almost 

always is, the difference in our 
socioeconomic statuses. I heard 
this saying for the first time in my 
sophomore year: “In the lower class, 
prestige is measured by money; 
in the upper class, it is measured 
by taste. But in the middle class, 
prestige is measured by education.” 
This was especially true of the 
upper¬middle class, students who 
comprised a sizable portion of the 
students at my new school, and 
explained the hyper¬competitive 
academic atmosphere that I found 
so incredibly bizarre.

I spent three years at that school 

from which I would eventually 
graduate. There, I found sanctity 
in 
close 
friends, 
capable 
and 

compassionate 
teachers 
and 

riveting course material. However, 
despite 
my 
satisfaction 
with 

my education, the notion that it 
was never actually intended for 
students with my socioeconomic 
background weighed heavily on the 
back of my mind. I had gone out of 
my way to obtain it, and it had been 
good to me — but it was never really 
mine to have.

From this contemplation came 

a fixation on the education system, 
which I would soon come to realize 
is inherently political. I became 
fascinated with the lifestyle of the 
upper class and how it factored into 
their superior schools and academic 
aptitude. They had museums and 
bookstores and coffee shops, they 
appreciated art and literature and 
music — surely that helped to foster 
their success, right? I attended 
graduation parties the summer 
after my senior year, where I 
admired the catered food and 
elaborate decorations and watched 
in awe as my friends’ parents, who 
were alumni of Yale and University 
of Chicago and Northwestern, 
bid their children farewell as they 
followed in their footsteps. I longed 
for this way of life to replace my own 
bland, working-class existence. I 
envied the elite and their seemingly 
effortless admission into selective 
schools, their distinguished careers 
and their articulate manner of 
speaking.

My obsession soon evolved into 

an implicit resentment for anyone 
who had it easier than I did. I 
firmly (and wrongly) believed that 
everything they earned was a result 
of their upbringing, which was 
coincidental at best. Compulsively, I 
researched housing discrimination, 
allocation of funds among school 
districts, redlining — anything 
that could explain the disparities 
I observed between my world and 
theirs. It was then that I discovered 

the harsh realities of the education 
system and, proportionately, the 
class system in general. None of it 
was mere coincidence, but rather 
a hopelessly complex, deliberate 
network of structural barriers 
historically 
rooted 
in 
racism, 

sexism and, of course, classism.

It alarmed me, the idea that 

everything I experienced was the 
symptom of an insidious framework 
of 
oppression 
that 
was 
both 

established and strengthened by 
past events and outdated ideologies. 
If all of our political machines were 
so tightly interwoven and affected 
every facet of our existence so 
thoroughly, 
then 
I 
wanted 
a 

comprehensive understanding of 
the system in its entirety. I wanted 
to know who was responsible for 
the elevation of some schools and 
the impairment of others — for 
paving the path to higher education 
for some students and obstructing 
it for others. Though the truth 
can be fragmented at times, I still 
believe it will reveal itself as I build 
my understanding of the political 
process.

If necessity is truly the mother 

of invention, then the need for 
answers has naturally created an 
activist. My political history may be 
sparse, but it has always pointed in 
the direction of this preoccupation 
with the truth. Now, as I immerse 
myself in activist culture at the 
University, I feel as though I am 
making up for lost time — time 
I spent unaware of how deeply I 
was impacted by a class structure 
designed to keep people like me 
from reaching their full potential.

Perhaps I will never know what 

exactly separates me from my well-
read, well¬rounded classmates in 
high school, but I have decided to 
dedicate my life to figuring it out, 
whatever that entails.

Living in the real world

I 

kicked the frozen dirt as I 
walked my usual 30 paces 
ahead of my family. Between 

the gray sky and 
the 
twisting 

branches, 
the 

path was dark; 
though the trees 
were empty of 
leaves, they still dimmed the day. 
With ears cocked like a retriever’s, 
I listened to my rabid sister’s chat-
ter — not because of the cold, but 
because of the excitement of her 
college experiences.

My sister is not one to miss an 

opportunity. I noticed my toe catch 
on a rock as I heard my dad snort 
behind me. In response, my sister 
halted her fantastical monologue to 
snarl a what? The laughter was still 
in my dad’s voice as he replied, “You 
do so many things that it is hard to 
keep track. How do I know what to 
be excited about? You have so many 
ideas — some you only try out in a 
sentence.”

Her current job allows her to 

cartwheel down the halls between 
stacks upon stacks of obscure books 
in the lower levels of the library. 
She sends me pictures of her favor-
ite titles.

She also has a job plucking the 

feathers off birds and placing their 
bones into formaldehyde jars; she 
is a member of a dance team that 
mixes traditional Northern Indian 
folk with hip hop (although she had 
never danced a day in her life before 
joining); she organizes and refer-
ees tennis matches; she started a 
cross-country ski team (though she 
has no skis at school and lives in a 
sprawling urban environment0; she 
volunteered in a hospital for about 
four hours; she was a member of 
the crew team for the duration of an 
e-mail exchange. She also conduct-
ed research on bones infected with 
malaria and traveled up to Alaska to 
survey archaeological sites, check-
ing to see if the climate had weath-
ered them. And yesterday, she left 
for Senegal.

She wants to be an archaeologist.
She wants to be an animator and 

work for Pixar.

She wants to be a doctor.

She wants to be a humor writer 

for Saturday Night Live.

She wants to discover mermaids.
My sister was in true disbelief at 

my dad’s frustration. “What’s wrong 
with that?” she asked. I sensed my 
dad’s struggle to reply, and, after 
a moment, I heard his hands drop 
to his sides and his breath stagger 
across the air.

I found this exchange of dire 

importance. 
When 
should 
one 

dream on the inside instead of 
describing their dreams out loud? 
When should one live inside their 
own head? Could I justify being as 
jealous of my sister’s lively imagina-
tive life as I was of her real one?

I recognized that I spend a lot 

of time living inside my own head 
instead of the real world. I counted 
the attributes. Confining my world 
to the inside of my brain has made 
me prone to excessive worrying. 
My internality may take away from 
activity in the physical world. I 
often have a surprised tone when 
someone starts a conversation. I 
often forget where and when I am 
(This is frightening — what are we 
without context?).

This seems an overwhelmingly 

negative way of life at first glance. 
However, those who live internally 
often are the most creative — writ-
ers, artists and inventors. A life of 
thought also contributes to one’s 
self-awareness and often leads to 
being conscious of and thoughtful 
toward others. Life inside works 

much like a good book, allowing you 
to transcend space and time, giving 
a more abundant and exciting life.

That last point is not a good one. 

In fact, it is the reason why living in 
your head seems so bleak. Because 
when one reaches the final page 
of a book and realizes the journey 
has not been a real one, the world 
feels empty. I tried to think of why 
the outward excitements of my sis-
ter and the constant buzz inside 
my own brain have such different 
effects. 

The best explanation I can offer 

regarding the difference between 
her and me is that she gives each idea 
a chance (though the duration of 
each chance varies). She gives them 
at least one gulp of oxygen as she 
lets them fly off her tongue. At least 
one. Whether spoken to my parents 
or via an e-mail to the rowing head 
coach, she gives her ideas space to 
be real. Never did my mother tell me 
to think before I spoke. I always did 
on my own, so thoroughly that few 
sentences escaped my lips. I am not 
one to take risks, even in speech, but 
if one cannot say it, how does one 
ever expect to accomplish it?

The line between life in your 

head and life outside of it needs to 
be crossed when one senses them-
selves ceasing to speak. The first 
step to overcoming an obstacle 
should be to speak its name, just as 
it should be the first step in achiev-
ing a goal or enacting a plan. Just as 
silence may be the fence that traps 
one inside of one’s own head, speech 
may be the easiest bridge to action.

One Wednesday night, it was 

quiet hours in the dorms, and I 
was walking out of a friend’s room 
laughing freely. A boy I knew poked 
his head out from his room into the 
hall, sternly reminding me of quiet 
hours. I did not apologize. Because 
I say so little, I have started to feel 
ashamed taking back what little 
sound I make. I laughed some more. 
It felt good to live in the real world.

Stunning ‘Carol’

Timely drama is a 
great movie and an 

important one

By CHLOE GILKE

Daily Arts Writer

During a pivotal scene in the 

10 p.m. showing of “Carol” that 
I attended last Sunday, I heard 
a tinny pair of 
giggles 
com-

ing from the 
row behind me. 
Initially, I was 
annoyed. Why 
was 
someone 

laughing 
dur-

ing this gor-
geous 
scene, 

hee-heeing 
at 

the consumma-
tion of the blossoming emotional 
affair between the film’s pro-
tagonists? How could two people 
in the same theater as me occupy 
such a different position than I 
did — how could they be laugh-
ing at lesbians? I turned around 
and gave my best Clint Eastwood 
glare at the couple behind me. It 
was two women, holding hands 
and wearing the same raptured 
smile I had a minute earlier.

“Carol” is both a great movie 

and an important one. The film, 
based on Patricia Highsmith’s 
“The Price of Salt,” details the 
emotional affair between the 
moody, compelling Carol Aird 
(Cate 
Blanchett, 
“Blue 
Jas-

mine”) and naive department 
store employee Therese Belivet 
(Rooney Mara, “The Girl with 
the 
Dragon 
Tattoo”). 
Since 

“Carol” is set in the early 1950s, 
their relationship proceeds in a 
different manner than it would 
today: Queerness is the ultimate 
taboo, a symbol of moral devi-
ance. Everything has to happen 
in secret, everyone who wants to 
be well regarded in society must 
operate behind closed doors. The 
notion of “being in the closet” 
doesn’t even apply, because for 
Carol and Therese, there is no 
alternative on the other side of 
that door.

But if you’re expecting a 

tragic queer melodrama à la 
“The Normal Heart” or “Broke-
back Mountain,” prepare to be 
disappointed. As directed by 
Todd Haynes (“I’m Not There”), 
“Carol” is undeniably sweet, 
offering plenty of moments of 
levity, maybe even some worth a 
giggle. Blanchett’s performance 
as Carol is delectable, especial-
ly the way she initially dances 
around her attraction to Therese: 
saying “I like your hat” during 
their department store meet-
cute, 
pronouncing 
Therese’s 

name like it’s a line of poetry. 
Blanchett’s sophistication and 
boldness drives the narrative for-
ward, winning Therese’s affec-
tions and eventually our own. It’s 
hard to watch this movie and not 
fall in love with Carol Aird.

“Carol” ’s cinematography and 

production design are due credit 
for the film’s dreamy, roman-
tic mood. Cinematographer Ed 
Lachman (a frequent collabo-
rator with Haynes) frames the 
two actresses in intimate close-
ups, often focusing on a single 
body part — Carol’s electric pink 
nails, Therese’s blue eyes. In a 
film about lesbian romance, the 
female characters’ preoccupa-
tion with other women’s bod-
ies is a subversion of the typical 
“male gaze” formula of looking 
at women’s bodies. Carol and 
Therese are discovering one 
another, and it makes sense that 
Therese would be looking so 
carefully at Therese — she is a 
photographer and artist, after all. 
The set design and art direction 
are likewise intricate and beau-
tiful, especially the visual paral-
lels between Therese and Carol’s 
six-year-old daughter. (Both have 
short brunette hair and bangs 
and are dressed frequently in 
primary colors and jewel tones.) 
This is the kind of movie you can 
watch over and over again and 
always discover a new and stun-
ning trick of filmmaking.

In addition to “Carol” ’s sophis-

ticated style and award-worthy 
performances, the subject mat-
ter is especially timely. On the 
heels of the summer’s Supreme 

Court marriage equality deci-
sion, great queer love stories 
have a special exigency. If Carol 
and Therese weren’t fictional and 
if they were alive today, I’d hope 
that the characters might meet a 
different end than they do in this 
movie. Maybe Therese wouldn’t 
be dating a well-intentioned 
but clueless man with whom 
she has no passion, and maybe 
Carol wouldn’t be haunted by 
her boozy, vengeful ex-husband. 
Maybe the world wouldn’t be so 
hell-bent on keeping these two 
women apart, and their romance 
could unfold in places other than 
hotel rooms and phone calls 
where no one can hear. But the 
secrecy and hushed nature of 
their courtship depict a harsh 
reality — people really did have 
to live like this, and in certain 
communities, they still do.

One of the film’s most poi-

gnant moments comes when 
Therese broaches the subject 
of homosexual desire with her 
boyfriend Richard (Jake Lacy, 
“Obvious Child”). She asks him 
if he’s ever heard of people being 
attracted to members of the same 
sex. Of course he cites knowing 
of “guys like that,” but it’s not 
possible for two men to “fall in 
love suddenly with each other, 
out of the blue.” According to 
Richard, you’re either like that 
(different, taboo, deviant), or 
you’re not. Simply bringing the 
topic up is enough for Richard 
to grill Therese on her sexuality 
and berate her for not returning 
his affections. From a 2016 per-
spective, Richard’s assumptions 
seem especially coded with gross 
heteronormativity and hateful-
ness. He’s just clueless.

When the two women behind 

me giggled at a love scene 
between Carol and Therese, I had 
every reason to be irked. “Carol” 
is a stunning romance film, ele-
gant and elegiac and undeserving 
of schoolgirl whispers. It makes 
your heart hurt, makes you think 
and makes you understand. I can’t 
know for sure, but I think the 
women behind me were laughing 
because they appreciated all of 
this. They understood.

FILM REVIEW

FILM REVIEW
Overwhelming ‘Joy’ 

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

On the way to see “Joy” with 

my mom the day after Christmas, 
we stopped and ran some errands. 
At 
CVS, 
the 

woman at the 
counter 
gave 

me a quick les-
son in coupon-
ing and told me 
how to use two 
of the receipts 
I had together 
to buy a new 
razor for only 
a dollar. When we dropped off a 
skirt to be taken in at the tailor, 
the seamstress talked about her 
holiday dinner while she penciled 
in appointments for the upcoming 
week. We ran through the thick-
falling snow to the dry cleaners to 
pick up a couple of shirts for my 
dad, and after we carefully hung 
them in the back seat of the car, 
we were back on our way to the 
movies.

In “Joy,” a struggling single 

mother (Jennifer Lawrence, “The 
Hunger Games”) works to sup-
port her sprawling family while 
continually slighted by her bed-
ridden mother (Virginia Madsen, 
“Sideways”), aimless ex-husband 
(Édgar Ramírez, “The Bourne 
Ultimatum”) and flighty father 
(Robert De Niro, “Goodfellas”) 
who all depend on her. After being 
dragged on a sailboat trip where 
she is forced to clean up spilled 
red wine and broken glass with 
an old mop, cutting her hands 
in the process, she borrows her 
daughter’s crayons to draw up 
the blueprints for a self-wringing 
mop, finally fulfilling her dream 
of being an inventor after years of 
pushing her own life to the side. 
Joy works tirelessly to sell her 
mop on streets, in shops and later 
on QVC, eventually becoming a 
hugely powerful businesswoman 
and multimillion dollar corpora-

tion owner.

Based on the real life of Joy 

Mangano, 
whose 
inventions 

include not only the self-wringing 
mop but velvet hangers, travel-
ing cosmetic cases and portable 
steamers, the film holds storytell-
ing itself up as a central theme, 
speaking 
almost 
anecdotally 

about the complications that come 
with achieving the American 
Dream. Joy’s grandmother Mimi 
(Diane Ladd, “Chinatown”) nar-
rates the entire story from beyond 
the grave and the film is peppered 
with footage from the characters’ 
home movies, calling attention to 
the construction of the story itself. 
There is a strange mix of authentic 
moments and constructed ones, 
and Joy first comes to understand 
ideas of betrayal and determina-
tion through watching elaborate 
soap operas with her mother as 
a child. Additionally, as she and 
her husband fall in love, they 
sing together on a stage with fake 
snow falling and artificial light 
encircling them. It’s not exactly 
the picture-perfect moment of 
seemingly realistic but less hon-
est films, but it also isn’t trying to 
convince its audience that perfect 
moments or successes just happen 
on their own.

“Joy” tells its story with the 

determination and quiet punch 
of a mobster film, with Jennifer 
Lawrence’s 
unforgiving 
stare 

managing to speak to the dual-
ity of a character who has given 
up everything and will fight tire-
lessly for success, all in the form 
of selling a mop and acting pri-
marily as a mother. She scouts 
out success in any niche that is 
available to her, and feminizes the 
mobster movie in a way that does 
not punch out one character to be 
replaced by a woman, or down-
play the power that comes with 
the genre. The mop that brings 
Joy success is designed by and for 
women looking for better ways 
to clean their homes and Joy’s 

young daughter hovers in the 
back of every scene, watching her 
mother’s long and winding path 
to reputability. “Joy” is a mob 
movie about the cottage industry 
in the midst of modernity, and 
it tells a story about American 
achievement from the ground up, 
showing that there is no set path 
toward success.

As I left the theater, over-

whelmed with the power that 
could come from this story about 
a mother inventing a mop with 
crayons and an under-the-table 
loan from a friend, I couldn’t help 
but think back to the women I 
had encountered earlier that day, 
working in stores around my 
hometown. “Joy”’s power doesn’t 
come from its elaborate cinema-
tography, attractive lighting or 
perfectly paced script. It comes 
from the reality of the situation it 
is reconstructing for us on screen. 
Every day in innumerable ways, 
we encounter mothers working to 
construct some sort of success for 
those who depend on them, in any 
way they find possible. Whether 
it’s inventing a new mop or hem-
ming skirts for a neighborhood of 
girls, this pocket of American suc-
cess reflects from the screen into 
our everyday lives. In the movie, 
as Joy sold her first round of mops 
on QVC, 50,000 units each priced 
at the classic infomercial rate of 
$19.95, my mom pulled out her 
phone in the middle of the the-
ater to calculate how much money 
was just made (around 1 million 
dollars). In the credits, it shows 
that Joy Mangano was one of 
the producers of the film, just 
another endeavor to add to her 
already long and diverse list. 
These crossovers between real-
ity and storytelling hit hard in 
Joy, bringing the film from the 
realm of a powerful, mobster-
esque movie to one about the 
reality of success in America and 
building a solid life any way you 
find possible.

2015’s Top Games

By JACOB RICH

Senior Arts Editor

1. Undertale (Toby Fox, PC)
The greatest children’s fiction 

is rooted in fear. Think about the 
moment of death in your favorite 
Disney movie, or the terrifying 
zombies in “Zelda,” or the gore 
and violence in Spielberg’s ubiq-
uitous blockbusters, or the Unfor-
givable Curses in “Harry Potter.” 
The best kid literature emphasiz-
es the joy and wonder the world 
has to offer while acknowledging 
the aspects of life that are, ironi-
cally, often deemed too scary to 
discuss with kids.

“Undertale” expertly employs 

this synthesis of joyful and fright-
ening. It’s a role-playing game 
that’s full to the brim with goofy, 
wonderful characters, laugh-out-
loud clever dialogue and beauti-
ful, quaint environments. It’s also 
a narrative about genocide. By 
allowing the player the choice of 
either fighting or talking to the 
game’s randomly encountered 
‘enemies,’ “Undertale” becomes 
an inversion of the classic ‘chosen 
hero’ mythology found frequently 
in RPGs. Being a hero in “Under-
tale” isn’t about slaying evil mon-
sters. It’s about finding mutual 
understanding; discovering the 
reasons why people are different 
and learning to accept them, even 
though the process can some-
times be painful. It’s moral abso-
lutism, but it’s so well meaning 
that it’s tough to criticize.

But you can also kill every-

thing. You can live out your video 
game power fantasy, like you did 
in “God of War” and “Shadow of 
Mordor.” But once you do, there’s 
no going back. Not even if you 
delete your save file. The game 
remembers. Decisions in “Under-
tale” have consequence unprec-
edented in the medium, because it 
refuses to abide by rules that have 
long been standard in its genre.

There’s too much great stuff 

in “Undertale” to discuss in a lit-
tle blurb for a top ten list. I can’t 
believe I haven’t even touched 
on the soundtrack (the best of 
the year by a mile), or the sav-
age but loving parodies of dating 
Sims and “Final Fantasy VI,” or 
the little character moments that 
are completely unnecessary but 
contribute so much to making the 
game’s world worth caring about.

You’ll never forget the time you 

spend with “Undertale.”

2. Bloodborne (From Soft-

ware, PS4)

It’s 2015. Video games are more 

diverse and inclusive than they’ve 
ever been. If your game is still 
structured around blood and gore 
and killing stuff, you’re going to 
have to be the cream of the crop to 
impress me. “Bloodborne,” 2015’s 
goriest, bloodiest game about kill-
ing stuff, impressed me.

Since their 2009 breakthrough 

game “Demon’s Souls,” developer 
From Software (which I imagine 
consists of dozens of depressed 
Japanese salarymen who have 
similar worldviews to me) has 
been lauded as the last bastion 
of old-school difficulty in action 
games. They’re the heir appar-
ent to games like “Ghouls and 
Ghosts” and NES-era “Castleva-
nia,” where killing gross mon-
sters was a simple pleasure and 
even the shortest games were so 
hard they took ages to beat. From 
Software has been doing the best 
work in the genre for years, but 
now they have a budget.

“Bloodborne” blends top-of-

the-line monster-slaying combat 
with a strange, environmental 
otherworldliness influenced by 
Lovecraftian 
cosmic 
horror. 

Exploring the city of Yharnam 
is like a fever dream of violence 
and 
surrealist 
imagery, 
but 

“Bloodborne” ’s violence is less 
Hot Topic pseudo-edginess and 
more intimately crafted deprav-
ity. This might be meat-and-pota-
toes video game, but it’s the best 
damn 
meat-and-potatoes 
I’ve 

eaten all year.

3. The Witcher III: Wild 

Hunt (CD PROJEKT RED, 
Xbox One, PS4 and PC)

“The Witcher III” makes me 

proud to be Polish. If you haven’t 
heard of it, “The Witcher” is a 
fantasy 
mega-franchise 
that’s 

essentially 
the 
equivalent 
of 

“Game of Thrones” in the country 
(there’s books, shows, movies, and 
games). The games in particu-
lar have really hit in the United 
States, with this entry in particu-

lar taking home numerous Ameri-
can game of the year awards. It’s 
for good reason — this is a fantasy 
universe that’s made the transi-
tion to open-world gameplay with 
stride, providing a fantasy nar-
rative that’s actually mature and 
interesting where many games 
fail to be. Pogroms, abortion 
and rural superstition are tough 
themes to explore in this format, 
but “Witcher” deftly handles 
these weighty topics using inti-
mately crafted cutscenes and 
complex characters that are given 
lots of quiet moments to develop 
in between epic monster-slaying 
adventures.

Oh, and its combat system 

emphasizes thoughtful prepara-
tion over in-the-moment RPG 
reflexes, which is a nice change 
of pace. It’s also incredibly meaty 
with content, and pro-consumer 
developer CD PROJEKT RED has 
a nice habit of providing lots of 
free DLC to reward its loyal fans. 
“The Witcher III” is quite the 
package: it’s games as art, enter-
tainment and service, all done 
right.

4. Metal Gear Solid V: The 

Phantom Pain (Kojima Produc-
tions, Xbox One, PS4 and PC)

How can a fifth entry in a 

hugely 
popular 
blockbuster 

series be the most daring game of 
the year? This open-world mag-
num opus is the first big stride 
the genre has made in many 
years thanks to Kojima Produc-
tions’ complete 180-degree turn 
in design philosophy. Where 
the previous “Metal Gear Solid” 
games wore their genre film 
inspirations on their sleeve, this 
one prioritizes emergent sand-
box gameplay. “MGSV” trans-
forms what could have easily 
been another boring open-world 
shooter into a gleeful, flamboy-
ant, ultraviolent romp through 
base after base of enemy soldiers 
— the clay for the player to sadis-
tically mold with an immense 
arsenal of brutal weaponry and 
stealth trickery. The scummy 
microtransactions added since 
the game’s launch diminished its 
lasting appeal, but the base game 
is so good that not even the ter-
rible business practices of pub-
lisher Konami can keep it from 
its rightful place high on this list.

5. Sonic Dreams Collection 

(Arcane Kids, PC)

At its core, “Sonic Dreams Col-

lection” is deep sexual fear. It’s a 
twisted, nihilist parody that rel-
ishes in the weird stuff we do with 
our doors closed and our Internet 
browsers open.

Possibly the first instance of 

the “found footage” genre in 
video game history, this game 
was announced as a discovered 
set of “Sonic The Hedgehog” pro-
totypes SEGA made for their fail-
ing Dreamcast console in the late 
90’s. But once the “Sonic Dreams 
Collection” devolves into furry 
prom night threesomes, feeding 
fetish porn and nightmare gas-
trointestinal nativity scenes, it’s 
pretty obvious that the family-
friendly Japanese developer had 
nothing to do with this.

But that doesn’t change this 

game’s raw power; the power to 
discomfort and terrify and, best 
of all, elicit laugh after laugh. 
This game and developer Arcane 
Kids’s 2013 masterpiece “Bubsy 
3D: Bubsy Visits the James Tur-
rell Retrospective” are a one-two 
punch of profoundly affecting 
avant-garde challenges to form. 
Do not write this game off 
because it’s a free download. This 
is one of the best video games of 
the year.

6. Batman: Arkham Knight 

(Rocksteady, Xbox One and 
PS4)

I’ve felt that the transition to 

open-world gameplay was the 
wrong direction for the “Bat-
man: 
Arkham” 
games 
since 

“Arkham City.” While there are 
definite improvements in player 
movement and visual design in 
“Arkham Knight”, debut game 
“Arkham Asylum” still remains 
the best interactive Batman 
experience. Its contained envi-
ronment that had only been seen 
in glimpses in the comics pro-
vided an incredible nightmare-
playground to get acclimated 
to. By the end, it felt like home. 
There’s no familiarity with big-
ass open-world cities like the one 
in “Knight.”

That being said, “Knight” is the 

Batman game that does the most 

interesting stuff with the idea of 
Batman, both as a mythologized 
symbol and as a human character. 
Throughout the game Batman is 
wracked with fear, paranoia and 
self-doubt, visualized in one of the 
most ingenious uses of game form 
I have ever experienced. You’ve 
probably already had it spoiled 
for you if you follow games, but if 
you’ve somehow missed it, head 
into this one blind and see where 
it takes you. You won’t regret it.

Note that the PC version is not 

included in this ranking. I hear 
it’s a quite sub-par version of the 
game.

7. Fallout 4 (Bethesda, Xbox 

One, PS4 and PC)

Let’s just come out and say it: 

“Fallout 4” isn’t the leap ahead for 
Bethesda open-world games that 
“Skyrim” was. “Skyrim” will live 
on as perhaps the most important 
blockbuster video game of the 
2010s, while “Fallout 4” will be 
remembered as a nice, but ulti-
mately too iterative follow-up.

Still, the wonderful specific-

ity of exploration at your own 
pace (an experience so unique to 
video games and so wonderfully 
achieved in Bethesda’s RPGs) 
has not been lost here. Fallout 4’s 
immaculately detailed world was 
a joy to turn over from beginning 
to end, providing some wonder-
ful new characters and great little 
story beats along the way. It’s the 
most-good game you can get for 
$60 this year, but it’s not the best.

8. The Beginner’s Guide 

(Everything Unlimited Ltd., 
PC)

Davey Wreden’s personal opus 

begins as a simple walk-and-talk 
showcase of an indie developer’s 
unreleased video games, a sort of 
museum tour of a person’s inter-
nal creative energy. Things get 
interesting when the game design 
starts to talk back. “The Begin-
ner’s Guide” transforms into a 
commentary on sadistic voyeur-
ism and personal privacy, cen-
tered around a moral quandary 
— is it okay to assign meaning to 
art that isn’t yours? Is that what 
I’m doing with this entry in this 
top ten list right now?

I’m not sure, but I think it’s safe 

to say that you should buy and 
play “The Beginner’s Guide.” It’s 
cheap to say it’s unlike anything 
you’ve played before, but believe 
me on this one.

9. Until Dawn (Supermas-

sive, PS4)

“Until Dawn” is the greatest 

realization of R.L. Stine’s “Give 
Yourself Goosebumps” the world 
has ever seen, and I mean that 
in the best way possible. A teen 
horror tribute with elements of 
“Evil Dead,” “Scream,” “Saw,” 
and “The Descent,” “Until Dawn” 
is a choose-your-own adventure 
novel presented with possibly the 
best visual design, performance 
capture (Hayden Panettiere and 
a pre-“Mr. Robot” Rami Malek 
light up the screen here) and 
kinetic cinematography in video 
game history.

It’s a bit disappointing that the 

narrative structure changes little 
from playthrough to playthrough 
(especially since the game hints 
at such a feature up front) but 
what’s amazing about this game is 
that the player’s actions really do 
determine who lives and who dies. 
Any combination of the game’s 
eight cute teens can survive the 
night, and the game really under-
stands the fun of gory horror film 
death without feeling mean. What 
a lovely piece of trash.

10. Rocket League (Psyonix, 

PS4 and PC)

In a way, “Rocket League” is an 

elaboration on “Pong”: head-to-
head multiplayer with two goals 
and a ball. But “Rocket League” 
has cars with rockets strapped 
on them pushing around a giant 
soccer ball. The beauty of it is that 
it’s an idea we’ve all had – what if 
real-life sports were crazy dysto-
pian messes of steel, engines and 
explosions? “Rocket League” lets 
us live out this essential human 
fantasy.

This is a so-dumb-it’s-genius 

idea married to great gameplay. 
A revelation in physics-based 
object manipulation, “Rocket 
League” manages to capture 
the competitive spirit of soccer 
and simplify it to work perfect-
ly with a controller. This was 
my go-to competitive game for 
intoxicated hangouts this year, 
and I don’t see that changing for 
quite some time.

‘Point Break’ misses 
the point and breaks

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily TV/New Media Editor

Remakes are nothing new in 

Hollywood. Some of the greats, 
like Alfred Hitchcock and Cecil 
B. 
DeMille, 

have 
even 

remade 
their 

own 
works. 

But 
there’s 

something 
depressing 
about the cur-
rent 
remake 

movement 
presently 
ensnaring the cultural landmarks 
of the ’80s and ’90s. In attempt-
ing to adapt the excesses of these 
eras to the modern day, filmmak-
ers have decided that sucking all 
the energy out of these films is 
the best course of action — drain-
ing all shades of fun until the new 
version is as dull and colorless as 
their desaturated visuals. “Point 
Break” is a continuation of this 
disappointing trend, following in 
the footsteps of films like “Total 
Recall” and “RoboCop.”

The original “Point Break” 

is far from a work of genius. It 
edges into the ridiculous, but 
it fortunately cast future icons 
of the time including Keanu 
Reeves (“The Matrix”), Pat-
rick Swayze (“Dirty Dancing”) 
and, for better or worse, Gary 
Busey (“Lethal Weapon”). The 
memorable cast paired with the 
high-energy filmmaking of the 
then on-the-rise Kathryn Big-
elow (Oscar winning director of 
“The Hurt Locker”) elevates the 
film into the memorable terri-
tory of cult classic. However, the 
remake is a dour affair of little 
entertainment value filled with 
weak, flat characters and ideas.

Following former extreme 

poly-athlete Johnny Utah (Luke 
Bracey, “The November Man”), 
“Point Break” sees its protago-
nist join the FBI after a tragic 
motorcross accident claims the 
life of his friend (Max Theriot, 
“Bates Motel”). When a series of 
high stakes heists perplexes his 
superiors, Utah theorizes that 
the perpetrators are attempting 
the legendary “Ozaki Eight,” a 
series of extreme sports trials 
meant to honor nature. Going 
undercover, 
Utah 
immerses 

himself within a radical group 
of athletes and eco-warriors, 
led by Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez, 
“Deliver Us From Evil”).

While “Point Break” keeps 

the same overall story of its pre-
decessor, the filmmakers fail to 
breathe new life into the char-
acters. Bracey continues the line 
of Australian, Sam Worthing-
ton/Jai Courtney types that 
grow increasingly bland with 
each 
new 
incarnation. 
His 

Utah is formulaically brooding 
as he tries to find his place in 
life between the wildness rep-
resented by Bodhi’s crew and 
the structure of the FBI, sig-
nified by the figure of Pappas 
(Ray Winstone, “The Depart-
ed”). Bracey never sells this 
inner conflict, mainly because 
screenwriter 
Kurt 
Wimmer 

(who wrote the underwhelm-
ing “Total Recall” remake) 
never gives him any opportuni-
ties. Utah just gets swept up in 
whatever side is convenient, his 
attachment never truly devel-
oping for either of the causes.

Meanwhile, both Bodhi’s crew 

and the FBI struggle to make 
any impression. Wrapped in self-
seriousness, the two groups are a 
drag to be around. The extreme 
athletes are a boring bunch with 
hardly any distinguishable char-
acteristics between them. Instead 
of personalities, every member 
just spouts the same pseudo-
philosophical 
rhetoric 
about 

finding balance, pursuing their 
“line” and protecting the Earth. 
Early on when one member dies 
snowboarding, it becomes hard 
to remember which one he was 
or even his name — he had blonde 
hair … I think his name was 
Chowder? Oh well, let’s skip to 
the next party scene so we can get 
some generic product placement 
and attractive women dancing.

Winstone hardly does any 

better, trying his best in a 
thankless role that amounts to 
being a gruff veteran with no 
other personality traits outside 
of occasionally putting Utah in 

his indecisive place. Ramírez is 
the only actor to at least make 
an impression with his role, but 
even his talents can’t lift the 
leaden preaching of Bodhi.

The film tells the audience 

how connected characters are 
instead of developing these rela-
tionships organically through 
genuine interactions. This fail-
ure is most egregious in the 
romantic subplot between Utah 
and Samsara (Teresa Palmer, 
“Warm Bodies”), who only seem 
to talk to each other in broad 
platitudes — at least the pair 
look pretty, if that’s any consola-
tion.

Like its other remakes, the 

characters take themselves far 
too seriously in “Point Break,” 
robbing them of any relatabil-
ity or humor. They’re shallow 
cutouts who go to fight clubs 
and flip off the camera with a 
scowl, all in the name of being 
gritty. Every line is delivered 
with a straight face and no self-
awareness of their own ridicu-
lousness. At one point, Bodhi 
declares “The only law that mat-
ters is gravity” — he must have 
never learned about the laws of 
thermodynamics or any other 
laws of physics. The line is so 
unaware of its own absurdity 
it becomes laughable. Because 
“Point Break” is so engaged in 
its own self-importance that it 
forgets to have fun with itself, its 
over-the-top moments become 
even more unbelievable.

These problems are all really 

unfortunate, considering the 
stunt work in “Point Break” 
is actually quite impressive 
and employs some of the best 
extreme sports athletes per-
forming on location. However, 
Director Ericson Core (“Invinci-
ble”) never elevates these scenes 
to reach their full potential. It’s 
hard to invest in these high-
wire acts of daring when the 
characters that are performing 
them in the film are so forget-
table that you can’t remember 
or don’t care what happens to 
them, forming scenes that are 
dramatically empty and devoid 
of momentum.

With its energetic source 

material and solid stunt work, 
“Point Break” has no right to 
be boring, but it somehow finds 
a way to become increasingly 
dull and unexciting as it slogs 
through its nearly two-hour 
runtime. Whether it’s dimen-
sionless characters or a need 
to weigh down every scene 
with overt seriousness, “Point 
Break” is a joyless labor to get 
through. Instead, go see a film 
like “Creed,” “The Force Awak-
ens” or “The Hateful Eight” 
— productions that use ideas 
from their predecessors in new, 
engaging ways instead of drain-
ing the life out of them. Or just 
buy the original “Point Break” — 
it’s on sale on Amazon.

Misplaced focus 
in ‘Danish Girl’ 

Eddie Redmayne 
film not the story 

we deserve

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Film Editor

In 2015, the transgender com-

munity had more exposure in 
the mainstream media than ever 
before. 
This 

representation 
wasn’t 
always 

positive — there 
was the horri-
bly disrespect-
ful transgender 
reveal of the 
sociopathic 
A 

of “Pretty Lit-
tle Liars” and 
the superficial 
view of trans issues brought up 
by Caitlyn Jenner’s reality show 
“I Am Cait” — but there has also 
been realistic and positive repre-
sentation in the recent film “Tan-
gerine” and the television shows 
“Transparent” and “Orange is 
the New Black,” which more 
accurately portray the transgen-
der experience.

“The Danish Girl” contributes 

to this mixed representation of 
the 
transgender 
community. 

Directed by Tom Hooper (“Les 
Misérables”), the film is a beau-
tiful yet superficial depiction of 
the life of a transgender pioneer.

The film’s protagonist, the 

Danish painter Einar Wegenar 
(Eddie 
Redmayne, 
“Jupiter 

Ascending”), struggles with “the 
mistake of nature” that made 
him a biological man instead of 
the woman he truly is, a dan-
gerous identity to claim in the 
1920s. From our first glances of 
him brushing his fingers over 
racks of dresses and gently fix-
ing his wife’s lipstick, it is clear 
that Einar is drawn to the tac-
tile sensations that come from 
a traditionally feminine experi-
ence. When his wife, fellow art-
ist Gerda (Alicia Vikander, “Ex 

Machina”), needs him to don a 
dress, heels and stockings so she 
can finish a painting, Einar has a 
visceral reaction to the feminin-
ity of the materials.

Einar’s experimentations with 

the flexibility of his gender start 
as a joking game with his wife. It 
begins with him wearing Gerda’s 
camisole under his outwardly 
masculine attire, but becomes 
much more serious when his 
wife dresses him up entirely in 
women’s clothes, his wife’s friend 
christens him with the name Lili 
and Lili goes to a party in the place 
of Einar. As Lili, Einar becomes 
who she was meant to be. With 
Gerda’s unwavering support, Lili 
seeks sex reassignment surgery — 
the first person to attempt it. After 
meeting with several doctors and 
being diagnosed with schizophre-
nia and other mental illnesses, 
they finally find an understanding 
doctor willing to discuss the pos-
sibility of surgery.

“The Danish Girl” fits in per-

fectly with the rest of Hooper’s 
directorial repertoire, with its 
beautiful pastels and elegant 
establishing shots of Denmark 
and Paris reminiscent of his 
other works. The movie itself is 
well done and affecting, but its 
story focuses more on the cis-

gender protagonist, Gerda, than 
Einar’s transition to Lili. This 
isn’t to say that Gerda’s narrative 
is unimportant, as the emergence 
of Lili and the loss of Gerda’s hus-
band is a traumatic and compel-
ling storyline. But even the film’s 
title, when said in the movie, is 
referencing Gerda as “the Dan-
ish girl” in Paris. It makes one 
wonder whose story this movie is 
actually telling.

The film has also faced back-

lash for its employment of a cis-
gender actor, Redmayne, in the 
role of a transgender person. 
While Redmayne performs admi-
rably and will surely be nomi-
nated for a myriad of awards for 
his role, it’s a shallow interpreta-
tion of an incredibly meaningful 
event in the life of a transgender 
person. His interpretation of Lili 
is lovely and sad, but superficial in 
its attempt to show the emotions 
behind the new identity.

“The Danish Girl” tells the tale 

of two transformations — that 
of Einar to Lili and that of Gerda 
from happily married to single. 
Unfortunately, the prominence of 
Gerda’s arc indicates that while 
the story that’s there is beautiful 
and imaginative, audiences may 
have to wait before a transgender 
narrative can be the first priority.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Friday, January 8, 2016 — 7

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

At first, it seemed like the 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 

team was going to add another 
loss to its 
Big 
Ten 

record. 
At first, it 
seemed like the Wolverines were 
going to let their inconsistency 
get the best of them once again. At 
first, it seemed like Michigan had 
no chance of a comeback.

Instead, the Wolverines did the 

unthinkable.

For four minutes in the third 

and fourth quarters, Iowa (3-1 Big 
Ten, 12-4 overall) went cold and 
allowed Michigan (1-2, 9-5) to 
slowly claw its way out of the hole 
it had dug during the first half.

Initially, the game seemed like 

it was on the path to be a blowout. 
But the Wolverines dominated 
the fourth quarter and came away 
with an 82-75 win — its first win 
in the conference.

The comeback sent a previously 

quiet Crisler Center into an 
absolute frenzy. By the sound of 
it alone, Michigan might have just 
won the Big Ten Tournament.

“It’s really been a difficult 

couple of weeks,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “We’ve 
lost a lot of tough games, and our 
confidence was really shaken at 
some times. … (Iowa) went on 
that run and got it to 17, and we 
stopped looking at the scoreboard 
and really just buckled down, 
tried to get one stop at a time and 
then score down the other way.

“A lot of people stepped up and 

made really tremendous plays for 
us, especially down the stretch. … 
Just proud of our total effort and 
bounceback.”

That 
bounceback 
wouldn’t 

have 
been 
possible 
without 

sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty and senior forward 
Kelsey 
Mitchell, 
who 
each 

made huge strides in the final 10 

minutes of regulation.

Flaherty, who ended the game 

with 24 points, looked confident 
with every shot and continued to 
drain them from all over the floor.

When the game was within 

one possession, Flaherty drove 
inside the paint and rolled the ball 
off the backboard and into the 
net, falling into the cameraman 
behind the net before quickly 
reorganizing herself to get back 
on defense. That basket kept 
Michigan up by only one point 
with a minute left.

“There’s no words to describe 

it,” Flaherty said. “What we’ve 
been going through the past couple 
of games, it’s just a reminder to all 
of us that we can win and we can 
be one of the best teams.”

Mitchell followed up Flaherty 

with a layup of her own before 
making a huge defensive block 
on 
the 
ensuing 
Hawkeye 

possession, 
which 
ultimately 

ended with a turnover. In her 

first start since the Wolverines’ 
last win, Mitchell finished with 
her first career double-double on 
15 points and 11 rebounds.

Michigan’s comeback started 

in the third quarter when it 
changed its defensive strategy. 
After 
Iowa 
plowed 
through 

the 
Wolverines’ 
man-to-man 

defense to open the second half 
on a 6-0 run, Barnes Arico called 
a timeout and switched to a 
triangle-and-two defense. She 
also subbed out freshman center 
Hallie Thome for Mitchell, who 
added the physical grit that 
Michigan needed.

When 
the 
clock 
started, 

Michigan went on a 12-0 run to 
close the scoring deficit to just 
seven points as the Wolverines 
face-guarded the Hawkeyes’ two 
starting point guards.

“Even if a post player got the 

ball, they were immediately 
shaded or doubled,” Barnes 
Arico said. “It just got Iowa out 

of what they wanted to do, and 
they were never really able to 
get in rhythm again.”

Iowa, which didn’t stand a 

chance against a Michigan team 
quickly gaining momentum, went 
on another four-minute scoring 
drought in the final frame. At that 
point, the Wolverines opened with 
a pair of 3-pointers from junior 
guard Danielle Williams and 
freshman guard Nicole Munger.

The Hawkeyes couldn’t score 

for the final 1:51 of the game, 
resorting to fouling to try to inch 
back into the game.

But by that point, the game was 

decided, and Michigan finally 
found itself on the other end of a 
nail-biting game.

“We’ve been tested like that 

so many times in different 
situations, and we’re just sick of 
losing, sick of working so hard 
and coming out on the opposite 
end,” Flaherty said. “It was our 
time to close a game out.”

Mitchell powers 
‘M’ to big victory

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

Typically, 
Kelsey 
Mitchell 

is a soft-spoken person. But on 
Thursday night, she screamed.

Following an emphatic block 

in the waning seconds in a win 
against Iowa, the senior forward 
roared after her energy-sapping 
rejection, 
staring 
down 
the 

Hawkeye who was sprawled out 
on the hardwood.

“She’s 
a 
pretty 
even-keel 

person,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “But she does 
show emotion, and I think her 
showing emotion is a really good 
thing.”

In her fourth career start, 

Mitchell took over in the fourth 
quarter. With 44 seconds left in 
the game, she scored to give the 
Wolverines their first lead since 
1:52 remained in the first quarter. 
After Michigan’s deficit reached 
a high of 17, Mitchell led the team 
in the next three possessions with 
an offensive rebound, help on a 
defensive stop and another layup 
for a three-point lead.

It was Mitchell’s turn to step up 

and take the reins of her position, 
and on Thursday night, she made 
the case that her spot in the starting 
lineup should be cemented. Her 
15-point, 
11-rebound 
double-

double led Michigan to a much-
needed 82-75 win.

“It was just a rush,” Mitchell 

said. “I was thinking, ‘We came 
too far to lose now, so we might 
as well come out with the win. It’s 
just one step at a time.’ ”

The Wolverines have struggled 

at the ‘4’ and ‘5’ positions over 
the past few weeks. With the ‘4’ 
position in need of a consistent 
starter 
and 
freshman 
center 

Hallie Thome getting into foul 
trouble early in games, Barnes 
Arico needed her taller athletes 
to play disciplined in order to stay 
close against Iowa.

Thome picked up two fouls in 

the first minute of Michigan’s last 
contest against Indiana, though 
did not commit any in the first 
quarter Thursday. Her 6-foot-5 
frame kept the paint guarded, and 
she was able to pick up six points 

in the quarter as her teammates 
easily tossed the ball over Thome’s 
defender for a quick catch-and-
shoot layup.

At the ‘4’ position, Mitchell 

earned her fourth career start 
and scored four points to help 
Michigan stay tied, 19-19, with 
the Hawkeyes at the end of the 
first quarter. Her first basket came 
off of a slick spin move toward 
the basket that dizzied her Iowa 
counterpart. But while Thome 
stayed away from fouls, Mitchell 
fell victim to them. With 6:20 left 
in the second quarter, Mitchell 
picked up her third.

Sophomore 
forward 
Jillian 

Dunston and freshman forward 
Sam Trammel took Mitchell’s 
place at the ‘4’ while she sat on the 
bench, but the pair only combined 
for two points by the end of the 
first half.

Thome 
did 
look 
hesitant 

at times, sometimes allowing 
Hawkeyes to drive into the 
lane without their shots being 
contested in the paint. With just 
under two minutes left, Iowa 
guard Whitney Jennings missed 
a shot from behind the 3-point 
arc, but was able to grab her own 
rebound and zip past Thome for 
an easy two points. The basket 
sparked a 7-2 Iowa run to give the 
Hawkeyes a 43-34 lead going into 
the halftime break.

Mitchell 
didn’t 
start 
the 

second half. Instead, her spot was 
occupied by junior guard Danielle 
Williams as the Wolverines went 
with a small, guard-heavy lineup. 

Mitchell replaced Thome with 

8:06 left in the third quarter. 
After the substitution, Michigan 
went on an 8-0 run, anchored 
by a Mitchell layup. When the 
Wolverines cut the deficit to one, 
Mitchell took over again.

“In the past, I feel like we 

pondered on mistakes a lot,” 
Mitchell said. “But in today’s 
game, our goal was to look past it 
and go with the next play.”

Mitchell came into the lineup 

like a whisper, but ended with a 
much louder pitch. The noise she 
made is still sounding.

“Tonight was Kelsey’s night,” 

Barnes Arico said.

Michigan kicks off second half 
against in-state rival Spartans

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

When the Big Ten preseason 

polls 
were 
released 
at 
the 

beginning of the season, the No. 
8 
Michigan 

hockey 
team 

sat 
atop 
the 

rankings.

Just 
two 

spots down in 
third place was 
Michigan State, 
led by the 2015 
Big Ten Player 
of the Year in 
goaltender Jake 
Hildebrand.

With 
half 

the season gone 
and two weeks 
of Big Ten play 
completed, the 
Wolverines 
(2-1-1 Big Ten, 
11-3-3 overall) 
have lived up 
to their expectations, dropping 
just four points out of 12 in their 
first four games and winning the 

Great Lakes Invitational.

The Spartans (1-3-0, 5-13-2), on 

the other hand, have not.

Their 
season, 
filled 
with 

promise at the beginning, has 
unraveled, and the Spartans 
concluded 
2015 
with 
two 

heartbreaking overtime losses in 
the GLI.

Hildebrand 
has 
had 
little 

support from the players in front 
of him, especially the defense, 
which was one of Michigan State’s 
strengths coming into the season. 
A 2015 first-team All-American 
and Mike Richter Award finalist, 
Hildebrand has a save percentage 
of just .903 on the season.

In 
front 
of 
Hildebrand, 

forward 
Michael 
Ferrantino 

and 
Mackenzie 
MacEachern 

led the team with 16 and 15 
points, respectively. Freshman 
defenseman Zach Osburn and 
freshman 
forward 
Mason 

Appleton have impressed in their 
first season in East Lansing, but 
the duo has not been enough to 
turn around the Spartans’ dismal 
season.

Despite 
Michigan 
State’s 

performance, Michigan-Michigan 
State has always been a big rivalry, 
and this year is no different.

“No 
matter 
where 
(the 

Spartans) are in the Pairwise 
Rankings, I think that it’s such 
an old rivalry that it’ll be a tough 
game no matter what,” said 
sophomore defenseman Cutler 
Martin. “Whatever team that 
comes out to play is the team that 
will come out on top.”

With a majority of players 

on both teams hailing from 
Michigan, 
there 
will 
be 

familiarity between the two 
teams. But with six crucial points 
on the line, the players have made 
it clear that the friendliness stops 
as soon as the puck is dropped.

“When the game starts, it’s 

all business,” Martin, an East 
Lansing native, said. “They’re 
not my friends anymore, but I’m 
sure in the summer time, there 
are bragging rights for who takes 
care of business.”

Added junior forward Tyler 

Motte: “It’s a rivalry. Maybe you 
give someone you know a bump 
after the whistle to say ‘How’s it 

going,’ but between the whistle, 
it’s game on, especially against 
those guys.”

For the Wolverines, confidence 

has been high all season, and the 
GLI championship was a cherry 
on top of a solid first half to the 
season.

While Michigan has prided 

itself on its offensive firepower 
all season, it was the depth of 
the defense that shined through 
during the GLI.

Missing 
in 
action 
were 

sophomore Zach Werenski, who 
was busy captaining the U.S. Junior 
team at the World Championships; 
junior Michael Downing, who was 
suspended from the GLI after a 
dangerous hit against Minnesota; 
and senior Kevin Lohan, who has 
been injured since November. Yet, 
the Wolverines let in just four goals 
in two games.

In 
the 
trio’s 
absence, 

sophomore 
defenseman 

Sam Piazza was given a big 
opportunity. And he delivered, 
earning a goal and three assists, as 
well as All-Tournament honors.

“It 
was 
different 
because 

it wasn’t the usual lineup, but 
I think we are very deep on 
defense,” Martin said. “It was 
good 
second-effort 
hockey. 

Everyone blocked shots.”

But 
no 
one 
was 
more 

impressive at the GLI than 
freshman forward Kyle Connor, 
who 
many 
hockey 
experts 

thought should’ve been playing in 
Finland with Werenski.

Connor 
was 
named 

tournament 
MVP 
after 

registering a goal and two assists, 
and capped off a month that saw 
him score 13 points in six games 
en route to winning the Hockey 
Commissioners’ 
Association 

National Rookie of the Month for 
December.

Michigan will go into the back 

end of its season on track to make 
it back to the NCAA Tournament, 
a place the Wolverines have not 
been in three years.

But to get there, they will need 

to continue to play well. And it all 
starts Friday in East Lansing.

Purdue too much for ‘M’

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

WEST LAFAYETTE — Five 

minutes into the second half of 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s game 
against 
Purdue 
on 

Thursday 
night, 7-foot Boilermaker center 
A.J. 
Hammons 
received 
the 

ball just outside of the paint. He 
dribbled once, thrust his backside 
against junior forward Mark 
Donnal, bodied himself into the 
paint, turned around and put 
away an easy shot.

Three minutes later, 7-foot-2 

center Isaac Haas used a screen 
to slip by redshirt freshman 
forward D.J. Wilson. Teammate 
P.J. Thompson lobbed up a pass, 
and Haas threw down a dunk to 
complete the alley-oop play.

The Wolverines (2-1 Big Ten, 

12-4 overall) played each of 
their four big men in an attempt 
to 
combat 
the 
20th-ranked 

Boilermakers’ size, but Purdue’s 
(2-1, 14-2) frontcourt proved too 
much to handle, as Michigan 
fell, 87-70.

The 
Boilermakers 
bullied 

Michigan’s bigs, outscoring the 
Wolverines 42-18 in the paint.

Donnal 
started 
at 
the 

‘5’ 
position 
for 
the 
second 

straight game after impressive 
performances against Illinois and 
Penn State. But Michigan coach 
John Beilein had a short leash on 
his big men in the first half.

Wilson 
— 
who 
has 
been 

Michigan’s last big off the bench 
this season — was the first one 
off it Thursday. Wilson replaced 
Donnal less than two minutes into 
the contest after Donnal picked 
up his first foul. But Wilson didn’t 
last long himself and was replaced 
by sophomore forward Ricky 
Doyle after committing a foul of 
his own. The rotation continued 
with freshman forward Moritz 
Wagner subbing in for Doyle and 
eventually exiting soon after 
picking up his own foul.

Four minutes. Four different 

big men. Four fouls.

On the offensive end, both 

teams struggled to find their 
respective strokes early on, 
combining to shoot 2-for-10 
from the field in the game’s 
opening minutes.

Michigan was able to keep pace 

in the first half, limiting Purdue’s 
bigs from finishing down low. 
The Wolverines held a four-point 
lead with less than five minutes, 
but a 12-0 Purdue run gave the 
Boilermakers a 35-28 lead into 
halftime.

“The first half, I was so proud of 

the way our guys played defense,” 
Beilein said. “We were all over the 
place, we had the right — quick 
man we call it — when you can 
get the shooters, when you can 
give help off somebody. We made 
it tough for them. Second half, we 
just were not as good defensively.

“Post defense is something you 

try to work at. Then you play the 
best in the country at post offense 
and it’s an eye opener.”

Michigan’s 
second-half 

shooting was not enough to make 
up for its 10-for-31 first-half clip.

The 
Wolverines’ 
big 
men 

struggled against Purdue’s size. 
Hammons tallied 11 points in the 
frame. After shooting 42 percent 
from the field in the first half, the 
Boilermakers went 16-for-21 in 
the second frame, including 7-for-
10 from 3-point range.

As well as being undersized, 

Michigan was undermanned, too.

Caris LeVert sat out for the 

second straight game with a left 
leg injury and did not partake in 
pregame warmups. Beilein said he 
shot around earlier in the day and 
was still in pain.

Sophomore guard Muhammad-

Ali Abdur-Rahkman started in 
his place and did his best to fill 
the shoes of Michigan’s leading 
scorer. Abdur-Rahkman used a 
quick dribble drive to penetrate 
Purdue’s defense and finished 
10-for-16 for a game-high and new 
career-best 25 points.

“We were dialing him up,” 

Beilein said. “He’s got that ability 
— I call it an East Coast type of 
thing — where he can get buckets, 
in the wind, in the rain, outdoors, 
indoors, crooked rims, anything. 
He just finds ways to score.”

But the rest of Michigan’s 

roster struggled from the field, 
and Purdue turned defensive 
rebounds into made baskets on 
the other end.

Purdue guard Rapheal Davis 

guarded 
redshirt 
sophomore 

Duncan Robinson — Michigan’s 
best option from deep — and 
helped limit him to just five 
attempts from beyond the arc and 
two makes.

Junior guards Derrick Walton 

Jr. and Zak Irvin also struggled 
to find their strokes. Walton went 
3-for-9 from the field for 12 points, 
and Irvin made just two field 
goals in 38 minutes.

Abdur-Rahkman’s 
15 

second-half 
points 
helped 

keep Michigan in it, and the 
Wolverines trailed by just six 
with five minutes left. But they 
were never able to close the gap, 
and another 12-0 run by Purdue 
put the game out of reach.

“We just tried to (cut the lead) 

as a team,” Abdur-Rahkman 
said. “Try to get back into a flow 
of offense and not be hammered 
by their defense, just get into our 
offense, play our game.”

But Michigan’s game wasn’t 

enough to overcome Purdue’s size 
on both ends of the court.

“They’re 
better 
defensively 

than us, there’s no question about 
that,” Beilein said. “We were 
getting tough baskets. They were 
getting easy baskets. We answered 
with it tough — they were getting 
it easy. Pretty soon, you’re not 
going to make the tough, they’re 
going to make the easy.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Abdur-Rahkman 
steps in for LeVert

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

WEST 
LAFAYETTE 
— 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
was 
raised 
in 
Allentown, 

Pennsylvania — close enough to 
the Atlantic Ocean, in Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
coach 
John 

Beilein’s estimation, to qualify him 
as a basketball player of the “East 
Coast” variety.

Or, translated from Beilein-

ism to English: On certain nights, 
Abdur-Rahkman can essentially 
score at will.

“He’s got this ability — I call 

it an East Coast type of thing — 
where he can get buckets in the 
rim, in the rain, outdoors, indoors, 
crooked rim, anything,” Beilein 
said Thursday after Michigan’s 
87-70 loss at Purdue. “He just can 
find ways to score.”

It certainly seemed that way, 

as Abdur-Rahkman dropped a 
career-high 25 points and almost 
singlehandedly kept Michigan 
close in a game that, despite the 
lopsided final score, remained 
competitive through its first 34 
minutes.

The outburst eclipsed the 

sophomore’s 
previous 
career 

best of 18 last season at Michigan 
State, a game that forced Abdur-
Rahkman into the spotlight with 
then-junior guard Caris LeVert 
sidelined by a fractured foot.

Eleven months later, with 

LeVert nursing an injury to 
his left leg once again, Abdur-
Rahkman went a step further. 
Undaunted by the Boilermakers’ 
size, he took the ball to the rack 
repeatedly, lowering his shoulder 
and refusing to shy away from 
contact even in the face of his 
defenders’ chests.

Though 
Abdur-Rahkman 

found ways to score last season, 
attempting to replace LeVert’s 
production for the first time, 
this type of performance on 

the offensive end was out of the 
question.

“Last year, early in the year, 

any time there was body contact, 
he wasn’t finishing,” Beilein said. 
“He’s probably made the best 
(season-to-season) jump. He just 
really takes it at you.”

Abdur-Rahkman 
finished 

through contact, and when he 
did bounce away from a body-to-
body blow, he seemed to always 
finish — most notably with a pair 
of twisting, turning layups on 
consecutive 
possessions 
early 

in the second half that kissed 
high off the glass before finding 
their way down. He got the job 
done outside the paint as well, 
bookending 
his 
performance 

with 3-pointers early in the first 
half and late in the second.

The 
ability 
to 
avoid 
the 

outstretched arms of Purdue’s 
outsized 
front 
line 
was 
no 

accident. There’s no way to truly 
prepare for a game against a 
team with multiple 7-footers in a 
hostile Big Ten arena, especially 
as a 6-foot-4 guard. But somehow, 
Abdur-Rahkman’s shooting kept 
the Mackey Arena crowd of 13,063 
grumbling throughout the second 
half, keeping Michigan alive as 
Purdue threatened to pull away.

“I’m usually left open,” Abdur-

Rahkman said. “I just try to 
knock down shots and keep the 
same game plan as usual.”

Abdur-Rahkman was guarded 

closely far more often than he was 
left open Thursday, but regardless 
of his defenders, he may have to 
stick to the game plan a while 
longer. Beilein, as usual, gave few 
specifics as to LeVert’s status, 
saying merely that he participated 
in shootaround, experienced pain 
and did not play. But whether 
LeVert is out for another game 
or for another month, Abdur-
Rahkman’s ability to shoulder 
the scoring load should provide at 
least some solace.

Michigan rallies past 
Oregon State at home

Wolverines go on 
13-0 scoring run 

after falling behind 

6-0 vs. Beavers

By JORDAN HERBSTMAN

For the Daily

The Michigan wrestling team 

was down, 6-0, and decided 
to turn to redshirt sophomore 
George Fisher to get the team 
going. 
For 

a 
sudden 

and much-
needed 
victory, Fisher defeated Oregon 
State’s Jack Hathaway, 3-1, to 
break the Beaver shutout and 
catapult No. 13 Michigan to a 13-0 
scoring run. 

The scoring run launched 

the Wolverines (1-0 Big Ten, 5-1 
overall) to a come-from-behind 
victory over the Beavers (3-4). 

The Wolverines continued to 

show signs of dominance after 
Fisher’s victory when sophomore 
Alec Pantaleo took to the mat 
and carried the momentum from 
Fisher’s victory. 

Pantaleo started his match 

strong with two quick takedowns 
and 
ended 
the 
first 
period 

with a 4-1 lead. In the second 
period, Pantaleo took control 
of his opponent, scoring both a 
takedown and a four-point near 
fall to give him a 10-2 lead going 
into the third period. Pantaleo 
finished off his match with three 
takedowns in the third period, 
leading to an 18-4 personal 
victory and a 7-6 overall lead for 
Michigan in the match. 

But this wasn’t Pantaleo’s 

first time facing redshirt junior 
Joey Delgado. 

“I wrestled that kid actually 

a month before at the Cliff Keen 
tournament and it was only a two 
or three-point match,” Pantaleo 
said. “I watched my match against 
him. I knew exactly what he was 
gonna do, and that’s why when I 
wrestled him, I didn’t go charging 

at him. I stayed back. The wrestling 
was a lot smarter. The little tweaks 
make a big difference.” 

After 
going 
up 
7-6, 
the 

Wolverines did not look back, 
losing only one of the six 
remaining 
matches. 
Another 

burst of dominance came right 
after Pantaleo’s match, when 
junior Brian Murphy earned a 
pin over Oregon State wrestler 
Abraham Rodriguez in the second 
period of their match. After a four-
point near fall in the first period, 
Murphy finished off his opponent 
with the pin to give Michigan a 
13-6 lead. 

“I brought up the intensity a 

little bit,” Murphy said. “I think 
that he wasn’t going to be able to 
hang with me, and I was able to 
eventually get the pin.” 

After an Oregon State victory 

to push the score to 13-9, 
Michigan turned to redshirt 
sophomore Davonte Mahomes to 

regain the momentum. 

After leading 4-1 after the 

second period, Mahomes turned 
up the intensity and scored 
10 points, en route to a major 
decision with a 14-2 victory. This 
gave the Wolverines a 17-9 lead 
and squashed any hopes of a 
Beaver comeback. 

“At first I started off a little 

slow,” Mahomes said. “But once 
I got really into the match, I 
started getting warmer and was 
constantly thinking scoring point 
after point.” 

The team effort put away 

Oregon 
State, 
and 
helped 

Michigan end on a 14-0 scoring 
run, leading a 27-9 final victory. 

“I’m happy with the way that 

I’m training and the way the team 
is training and how everything is 
looking right now,” Mahomes said. 
“It’s very important. It’s a team, 
so everyone has to perform at that 
high level, at the high caliber.”

Underclassmen shine for ‘M’

By ETHAN WOLFE

Daily Sports Writer

It has been a month since the 

Michigan wrestling team last 
used its starters in a match. Yet 
on Thursday, the Wolverines’ top 
group had no problem picking up 
right where it left off. 

Michigan 
hosted 
Oregon 

State in the first annual Joe 
Wells Classic, honoring former 
Michigan assistant coach and 
Oregon State head coach Joe 
Wells, who passed away last 
April.

The 
match 
showcased 

quickness from the 13th-ranked 
Wolverines (1-0 Big Ten, 5-1 
overall), who overwhelmed the 
Beavers (0-0 Pac 12, 3-4 overall) 
en route to a 27-9 victory.

But 
the 
most 
significant 

takeaway 
from 
Thursday’s 

match was the performance 
of Michigan’s underclassmen: 
redshirt 
sophomore 
George 

Fisher, sophomore Alec Pantaleo, 
and redshirt freshman Davonte 
Mahomes.

Fisher had been fighting a 

near-even match against Oregon 
State’s Joey Palmer in the 133-
pound match, but Fisher gained 
momentum after a late 3rd-round 
escape, eventually earning a 
takedown in an overtime round 
to win the match, 3-1.

At the Cliff Keen Las Vegas 

Invitational 
in 
early 

December, 
Pantaleo 
was 

only 
able 
to 

amass a slight 
5-3 
decision 

over 
the 

Beavers’ Joey 
Delgado. 
But 

on 
Thursday, 

Pantaleo 
dominated, 
beating Delgado handily in the 
149-pound match, 18-3, to earn a 
major decision. Pantaleo finished 
with six takedowns and a near 
fall.

One of the youngest members 

on the team, Pantaleo dismisses 
the notion that age matters.

“With our team, there is no 

kind of age barrier,” Pantaleo said. 

“Whether it be Max (Huntley) 
being a fifth-year senior or me 
being a true sophomore, we all 
know that when we step on the 
mat, it doesn’t matter.”

Mahomes 
had 
a 
similar 

outlook.

“It’s a team, so everyone has 

to 
perform 

at 
that 

high 
level,” 

Mahomes 
said. 
“That 

has to happen 
to 
everyone 

no 
matter 

if 
you’re 
a 

freshman, 
sophomore, 
junior, senior.”

Mahomes 

handled Oregon State’s Tyler 
Chay with ease, winning 14-2 in 
what was his best match of the 
season. Mahomes tallied three 
takedowns and a four-point near 
fall. Mahomes nearly got the fall, 
but he ran out of time in the final 
round.

Junior 
Brian 
Murphy, 

who had the only pin of the 
night against Beaver wrestler 
Abraham Rodriguez in the 157-
pound match, spoke highly of 
the underclassmen and their 
performances 
against 
the 

Beavers.

“We don’t think of them 

as 
underclassmen 
anymore,” 

Murphy 
said. 
“They’re 
so 

mature in their wrestling and 
everywhere else, so I don’t really 
notice it. I don’t think of them as 
underclassmen.”

If 
Fisher, 
Mahomes 
and 

Pantaleo 
can 
continue 
to 

perform like they did against the 
Beavers, the Wolverines may find 
themselves back in contention 
for a national championship.

“We don’t think of them 

as 
underclassmen 
anymore,” 

Murphy 
said. 
“They’re 
so 

mature in their wrestling and 
everywhere else so I don’t really 
notice it. I don’t think of them as 
underclassmen.”

If 
Fisher, 
Mahomes 
and 

Pantaleo 
can 
continue 
to 

perform like they did against 
the Beavers, the Wolverines 
may find themselves back in 
the conversation for a national 
championship.
