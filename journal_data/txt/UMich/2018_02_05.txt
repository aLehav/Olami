Anne Berg, a University of 

Michigan lecturer of History, 
and Rackham student Andrea 
Gillespie discussed the facts 
and stigmas of the current 
refugee crisis at a dinner and 
lecture Saturday evening at 
Rackham Assembly Hall. The 
Michigan Refugee Assistance 
Program hosted the event, 
which illustrated the details 
of the refugee resettlement 
process and the impacts of the 
Trump administration on the 
crisis.

Gillespie, the vice president of 

external affairs of MRAP, works 
with many refugee resettlement 

organizations 
and 
currently 

focuses on refugee and forced 
displacement studies. Gillespie 
stated there are 22.5 million 
refugees currently registered 
with the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees, 
and 20 people are displaced 
every minute.

According 
to 
Gillespie, 

most refugees leave the top 
“source” countries of Syria 
and Afghanistan with the goal 
of fleeing to host countries, 
including Turkey and Pakistan. 
Lebanon is also a major host 
country — she stated one in four 
people in Lebanon are refugees.

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Police 

Department is recommending 
Scorekeepers –– a bar which, 
thanks to its popularity among 
University of Michigan students, 
is the most Ubered-to destination 
in the state of Michigan — lose 
its liquor license when it expires 
on April 30, according to a report 
from MLive.

The recommendation, made 

at the Jan. 12 meeting of the 
Council Liquor License Review 
Committee, was based on the 
more than 150 service calls to 
the bar in 2017. According to a 
memo signed by AAPD Sergeant 
Bill Clock and presented to the 
committee at its Feb. 2 meeting, 
the AAPD also filed 81 case 
reports for the location last year. 
Case reports, Clock wrote, are 
made for all criminal violations 
“and 
some 
non-criminal 

offenses.”

The memo lists the content 

of several reports, including 
one in which an officer issued 
Minor in Possession citations 
to 
two 
patrons 
who 
were 

drinking though each had an 
“X” written on their hands by 
bar staff, indicating they were 
minors. 
In 
another 
report, 

officers discovered the bar was 
displaying an expired liquor 
license, and in a third, officers 
issued an MIP to a patron who 
they determined had never been 
asked for identification by staff.

“Based on the number of 

overall incidents in 2017, and the 
listed violations, The Ann Arbor 
Police Department does not 
support renewal of this liquor 
license,” Clock wrote.

One student, who requested 

to remain anonymous out of 
fear of legal consequences, said 
Skeeps’ reputation as a haven for 
underage customers was widely 
known. The bouncers were strict 
about asking for ID, the student 
said, but not always as strict about 

making sure it was genuine.

“Everyone basically at Skeeps 

is underage, but they use a fake 
ID to get in,” the student said. 
“Everyone shows some sort of ID, 
whether it’s a fake ID or someone 
else’s ID, to get in.”

The bar has also received 

attention for its practice of 
selling “Skeeps cards” –– $3,000 
cards that give their owners VIP 
status, allowing them to cut the 
line and enter without providing 

proof of age. According to a 2014 
Spoon University article, the 
Skeeps card was originally given 
to patrons who accumulated a 
$1,000 tab and tipped 20 percent, 
but the bar had to raise the price 
several times to match demand. 
The anonymous student said 
she bought a Skeeps card her 
freshman year.

As of January 2018, students 

minoring in Community Action 
and Social Change through the 
School of Social Work are now 
eligible for a Poverty Solutions, 
Action & Engagement certificate. 
The certificate is sponsored by 
Poverty Solutions — an initiative 
that 
seeks 
to 
develop 
new 

strategies to fight poverty — and 
would allow for a more focused 
study within the CASC minor with 
additional resources from Poverty 
Solutions.

Because Poverty Solutions is 

a multidisciplinary initiative on 
campus, it adds and strengthens 
programs 
already 
available 

on campus. Julia Weinert, the 
assistant 
director 
of 
Poverty 

Solutions, said the CASC minor 
coordinated well with the initiative 
because they had similar goals.

“We partnered with the CASC 

minor,” Weinert said. “They’re 
very much aligned with their 
mission and their work to identify 
ways to act on issues of social 
justice.”

Candidates talk politicians failing the working-class, field constituent questions

The state of Michigan’s 2018 

Democratic 
gubernatorial 

candidates 
gathered 
at 

Washtenaw County’s Learning 
Resources Center on Saturday 
morning 
while 
attendees 

packed the hallway, exceeding 
the 
venue’s 
250-person 

capacity. 
The 
candidates, 

William Cobbs, Shri Thanedar, 
Gretchen Whitmer and Abdul 
El-Sayed, answered audience 
questions 
regarding 
their 

economic, environmental and 
health care policies.

Candidates 
differed 
on 

several points of policy during 
the debate, but all claimed the 
state of Michigan has failed its 
working-class constituents in 
recent years, often taking aim 
at Republican Gov. Rick Snyder 
and the GOP-led legislature for 
these failures.

On 
the 
economy, 
most 

candidates 
the 
decried 
tax 

cuts and abatements for large 
corporations during Snyder’s 
governorship as a failed policy. 
Cobbs, former vice president 
for 
Xerox, 
supported 
this 

sentiment.

Following 
controversy 

surrounding the Michigan State 
University Board of Trustees, state 
Rep. James Lower, R-Cedar Lake, 
introducedlegislation Thursday to 
change the way higher education 
board members are elected.

Currently, members of the 

state Board of Education and 
the boards of the University of 
Michigan, MSU and Wayne State 
University are selected through a 
statewide popular vote after being 
nominated by political parties. 
For many other universities in 
Michigan, board positions are 
already appointed by the governor.

If 
the 
legislation 
passes, 

Michigan’s 
three 
biggest 

universities would be under more 
government control through a 
constitutional 
amendment. 
It 

requires a two-thirds majority 
vote 
in 
the 
Michigan 
State 

Congress to be put on a ballot.

The plan would call for the 

boards to be terminated at the end 
of 2018, allowing the governor to 
appoint eight members on Jan. 1, 
2019. The state Senate would be 
able to provide advice and consent.

Two of the appointed members 

would serve for two-year terms, 
two for four years, two for six 
years and two for eight years. Any 
successors would be allowed to 
serve eight-year terms.

According to MLive, Lower 

said he wants this legislation 
to make university boards and 
Michigan’s Board of Education 

more cohesive.

“I believe voters should have 

the opportunity to decide for 
themselves whether or not the 
current 
system 
is 
working,” 

Lower said in a statement. “I have 
long considered the nomination 
and election process for these 
positions 
to 
be 
problematic. 

Voters often simply opt for the 
most recognizable names, or 
randomly bubble in their choice.”

The legislation comes after the 

MSU Board of Trustees has come 

under fire for standing behind 
former President Lou Anna Simon 
after Detroit News investigation 
found Simon and thirteen other 
high ranking University officials 
knew of MSU sports medicine 
doctor Larry Nassar’s sexual 
misconduct.

Simon 
eventually 
stepped 

down from the position on Jan. 
24, the final day of Nassar’s 
sentencing. 

A week later MSU of Trustees 

appointed 
a 
new 
interim 

University President, former 
Governor 
John 
Engler. 

Student and faculty have 
protested 
the 
decision, 

asserting Engler is another 
University 
insider. 
MSU 

faculty has formally held a 
vote of no confidence in the 
Board of Trustees.

Regent Ron Weiser, R, did 

not express support for this 
legislation, however. He said 
the Board of Regents at the 
University is bipartisan and 
operates in the best interest of 
students.

“This, probably, in my 

opinion, is throwing the 
baby out with the bath water. 
There certainly were errors 
made by Michigan State and 
its executive and regents 
and trustees and that doesn’t 
mean all boards should be 
changed. Right now, we have 
a system for choosing who the 
Regents are. It makes it less 
political than if the governor 
picks them.”

While 
Weiser 
said 
he 

recognizes the errors made at 
MSU, those errors don’t have 
to have implications for other 

universities.

“This, probably, in my opinion, 

is throwing the baby out with the 
bath water. There certainly were 
errors made by Michigan State 
and its executive and regents and 
trustees and that doesn’t mean 
all boards should be changed. 
Right now, we have a system for 
choosing who the Regents are. It 
makes it less political than if the 
governor picks them.”

State Representative Yousef 

Rabhi (D-Ann Arbor) agreed in 
that everyone at MSU needs to 
be held accountable, but he said 
this proposal is not productive 
towards that goal. He said if 
anything, more public oversight 
is necessary for the process of 
appointing board members.

“We need to hold everyone 

who was part of this tradgedy 
accountable, from the top down. 
However, this proposal will not 
achieve that outcome now or in 
the future. Appointing trustees 
shields from public oversight. 
Elections provide the highest 
form of accountability.

Rabhi 
said 
if 
politicians 

want a cohesive school board 
appointment 
system, 
all 

universities should have their 
governing bodies elected.

“Instead of making the process 

less democratic at a critical time 
and shileding key decision-makers 
from public scrutiny, we should 
remember that democracy is our 
greatest tool for accountability 
and that every election matters no 
matter how big or small.”

Jazz artist Joey Dosik came 

to the University of Michigan 
on a saxophone scholarship in 
2004. Now, 14 years later, he’s 
making strides as a solo artist, 
recently earning a record deal 
and preparing for a re-release of 
his debut extended-play record 
Game Winner along with a gig on 
“Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

In 2017, Dosik signed with 

record label Secretly Canadian, 
which 
marked 
a 
momentous 

boost in his solo career. Now, 
Dosik is excitedly anticipating his 
performance on Kimmel’s late-

night show on Feb. 13 as a prequel 
to his album’s re-release.

The beginnings of Dosik’s 

career 
had 
roots 
in 
his 

undergraduate 
experience, 

serving as a founding member of 
the Ann Arbor musical group My 
Dear Disco and collaborating with 
fellow University students of the 
funk group Vulfpeck.

Dosik opened for Vulfpeck 

while on tour with the group to 
promote their 2017 album Mr. 
Finish Line. During the tour, critics 
praised Dosik as an independent 
artist. Record producer Quincy 

Jones declared Dosik an “Artist to 
Watch.” 

In an interview with MLive, 

Dosik said he was very grateful to 
the internet age for helping him to 
share his music.

“Being an independent artist, 

I was able to begin to create an 
audience through the means of the 
Internet and what everyone was 
doing, which is running a record 
label off of our phones,” Dosik said.

He also spoke highly of his 

record label, Secretly Canadian, 
saying it shares mutual interests 
with him.

“When we chatted and got to 

know each other, I really got to 
recognize they are about the art 
and they get the music,” Dosik 
said. “Our relationship is one that 
will allow me to create, which is 
what I do best. It just seemed like 
a great fit.”

Dosik is already looking forward 

to a busy year. He has plans to tour 
Europe and perform at the South 
by Southwest music festival in 
Austin, Texas this spring.

NATALIA SANCHEZ

MiC Contributor

Please, tell me where I’m from

“Do you celebrate the Day of 

the Dead?”

The first (and, let it be known, 

only) time that someone asked 
me that, I was more than ready to 
start a hissy fit. My jaw fell open, 
my face contorted into a “did you 
really just ask me that?” type of 
look, my hands balled into a fist, 
nails digging so deeply into my 
palms I could have drawn blood, 
knuckles turning whiter by the 
second — waiting and itching 
and aching to just be driven 
through that ignorant fool’s nose 
because anyone who dares to so 
much as whisper detrimental, 
xenophobic or bigoted comments 
about my culture will, without a 
doubt, receive una bien merecida 
pescozá.

The issue is not so much 

the question or the curiosity 
that prompted the inquiry. I’m 
proud to call myself Latina, 
boricua and a puertorra. I wear 
my history with honor, I speak 
my first language with pride 
and every day I strive to prove 
myself because it isn’t just about 
me; it’s about what my native 
dialect represents, about how 
my actions, words and attitudes 
make or break a group of humans 
that have been marginalized 
and wrongfully stereotyped for 
years. 

I’ll gladly talk about my 

heritage and my home with 
anyone 
who 
is 
genuinely 

interested to learn. I can go on for 
hours about the lovely wonders 

hidden in Puerto Rico: La Isla 
del Encanto (about how delicious 
tostones are; how there’s a party 
around every corner and on every 
street, always; how the holidays 
start in Thanksgiving and end 
during the last week of January; 
how the natives love human 
interactions and connections, 
how pleasant conversations can 
start anywhere…). 

So why was I bothered then?
Because the only country that 

celebrates Día de Los Muertos 
is Mexico, and, no, not all 
Latinos that come to the U.S. are 
Mexican.

I 
was 
irritated 
because 

schools in the U.S. fail to explain 
Latin history and culture; fail 
to teach Spanish that surpasses 
elementary level “Hola, me llamo 
___”; fail to communicate the fact 
that there are more than 58.6 
million Hispanics in the United 
States; fail to mention that we’re 
the biggest and fastest growing 
“minority”; fail to indicate that 
Spanish is the second most 
spoken language in the world; 
fail to explain how “America” 
encompasses Hispanic countries 
located below the border...

They fail, fail and fail, time 

and time again, and I’m so 
exhausted from having to clarify 
what the differences between 
my culture and someone else’s 
are. How would you feel if I were 
to ask you: “Are you the guys that 
are famous for making maple 
syrup?” or “Everyone plays 
hockey here, right?”

It’s those micro-aggressions 

(those 
quick 
snide 
remarks 

that you don’t realize actually 
hurt and slash and burn until 

a while after they’re said) that 
make up part of the foundation 
of the bigger issue. When they 
accumulate and spill over the 
top, when they’re asked and 
said with such normalcy that 
they’re not considered incorrect, 
the ground is laid for the bigger 
societal acts of abhorrence and 
prejudice to flourish. 

Why is there so much hate and 

discrimination among racially, 
ethnically 
and 
religiously 

different groups? Why do so 
many U.S. men and women 
condemn and marginalize these 
groups, calling them thieves, 
rapists and criminals? Why does 
the media continuously portray 
them as such (as less than what 
they are; as less than any human 
should 
ever 
be), 
throwing 

wood into a fire that needs to 
be extinguished? Why, even 
though it is clearly written in 
the supreme law of the country 
that all men are created equal, 
all men, women and children are 
not treated equally?

It’s 
because 
people 
have 

grown used to not worrying 
about how their small comments 
and questions (just like: Do you 
celebrate the day of the dead?) 
can amount to the bigger picture, 
can evolve and transform into the 
larger issues. They’re missing, 
ignoring and not making the 
conscious 
effort 
to 
surpass 

the small step of learning and 
understanding that leads to 
assimilation and acceptance. 

Let’s be honest and frank here: 

A country created by immigrants 
should be more understanding, 
helpful, respectful and open to 
other immigrants.

A/PIA Community Spotlight

This post is a part of a series of 

Community Spotlights. If your 
cultural organization would like 
to be featured, please email us at 
michiganincolor@umich.edu.

Asian/Pacific 
Islander 

American 
Heritage 
Month 

is 
a 
nationwide, 
month-long 

celebration of A/PIA culture, 
traditions and history. Though it is 
typically celebrated in the month 
of May, the University of Michigan 
celebrates it throughout March 
and April because our academic 
year ends before May. Every 
year, United Asian American 

Organizations, 
the 
umbrella 

organization for several A/PIA-
interest organizations on campus, 
partners with the Office of Multi-
Ethnic Students Affairs to plan 
this month of events.

Last year, A/PIA Heritage 

Month featured many large-
scale events like the Generation 
Asian Pacific American Cultural 
Show (GenAPA) and the Midwest 
Asian American Student Union 
2017 Spring Conference. Other 
Heritage Month events included 
Uncover: A/PIA and UAAO’s 
#SayMyName photo and video 
campaign, Yoni Ki Baat’s annual 
monologue show, a film screening 
of Curtis Chin’s “Tested”, That 
Brown Show, and Chroma — a 

show 
exhibiting 
artwork 
by 

people of color. Finally, every year 
Heritage Month is ended by a 
closing ceremony to recognize the 
achievements of A/PIA students 
on campus. Below are some 
photos from different events that 
happened during A/PIA Heritage 
Month last year.

This year, UAAO and Office 

of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs 
are looking for people to work on 
a committee in various areas to 
showcase A/PIA culture. There 
are no interviews! We just want 
to hear from interested folks who 
are able to commit their time 
to helping plan A/PIA Heritage 
Month.

I contemplate 
an early exit
in sparkly,
 
silver

 
shoes.

Heart over head 
and hand over heart –
I look
 
so American.

And you,
standing 
across the way,
 
are small

with humility.
Your callused fingers,
 
bathed

in sunlight and industry,
 
touch me

with a softness
I can never return.

Bless fragility.
Its anxious self
 
quaking 

behind the ego. 
The quiver,
the tremble
cracking open my lips.
 
A fault

from which
the gargled vowels erupt.

Words spill out 
over all
the pretty 
 
conventions,

then settle,
holding us 
here
in this moment
where we are briefly 
 
familiar.

You,
my mother,
who keeps 
the crow’s feet
to remind her 
of flight,
whose freckles
 
punctuate 

the summer sky,
who knows 
more tones
than the pianist,
 
speak 

with bars
between your teeth.
Songs 
of mangrove trees
and lotus ponds. 
 
Yes,

bless the summer.

And I,
your incomprehensible 
child,

tongue-twisted 
and teary-eyed,
have only
broken language 
to offer.
But bless this language,
its ebb and flow.
How it shrinks 
 
from the mouth

to grow
 
in the ear,

unapologetically 
 
incomplete,

slicing,
dicing,
clipping 
 
the old 

 
ends off,

pushing,
pulling,
 
perverting, 

the speech
into something 
 
wholly

 
new.

May its sound

Every year, the Arab Students 

Association hosts Arab Xpressions 
— a cultural show dedicated to 
featuring the beauty of Arab 
culture. Join us Feb. 17 to enjoy 
traditional Arab dances, music, 
clothing, poetry and more. As we 
explore the unique experiences of 
Arab Americans through detailed 
displays and hilarious skits, we 
hope to provide a powerful and 
entertaining night for you and your 
family. The following spoken words 
were presented at Arab Xpressions 
2017:

Who am I?

A Bearded face, A Handsome 

face

Brown Eyes, Caring Eyes

Dark Hair, Silky Hair

Tanned Skin, Exotic Skin

Child’s 
thoughts, 
Loving 

Thoughts

Pause

Who am I?

Bearded face, Shady gaze

Brown Eyes, Menacing plans

Dark Hair, Wicked thoughts

Tanned Skin, distinct Skin

Bad thoughts, My Thoughts
When did I learn to fear myself?

-Tariq Mekkaoui

***
I look in the mirror.

And within me, I see my 

grandmothers. My sito marrying 
into the Arab culture, choosing 
to embody both worlds. My tata, 
raising five children within a civil 
war. And within me I see strength. 
They are not submissive.

I see my mother. Fueling her 

passion for education while doing 
everything in her power for my 
own. And within me, I feel her 
spirit. She is not passive.

These Arab women. Defying 

the stereotype unrightfully placed 
upon them every day.

They have inspired me. They 

have inspired me to redefine what 
being an Arab means to me. They 
are my role 
models. They are 

my heroes.

-Rasha Jawad

***

My hero.

My dad was 20 when he first 

set foot in America. He had little 
money, no backup plan and a 
mountain of dreams. Sacrificing 
everything to start a life in America, 
it was here that he really did start a 
life. It was here he found love. It was 
here he started a family. And it was 
here that he set an example that my 
siblings and I strive to follow every 
day. This is the embodiment of the 
American Dream. A dream that is 
still alive today, more than ever.

Although as Arabs we may face 

some hard times, let’s not forget the 
journey.

For it is only through facing 

difficulties that we see ourselves 
grow, and it’s only through adversity 
that we see communities unite. Let’s 
not forget the honor and privilege it 
is to be where we are.

For as proud as I am to call myself 

Arab, I am equally proud to call 
myself American. And more than 
happy to be Arab American.

-Bassel Salka

T

he 
United 
States’ 

political system was 
founded on the cultural 

myth that anyone with the 
skills and ability can rise to lead 
their community — almost half 
of the elected representatives 
to the first U.S. Congress, 
though, 
served 
alongside 

a blood relative. Since the 
U.S. became an independent 
republic in 1789, almost 400 
parent-child pairs and more 
than 190 pairs of siblings have 
served in Congress. Overall, 
more than 700 families have 
had two or more members 
elected to Congress.

Public office in America 

seems to work like any other 
family career — it’s inherited 
and 
taught 
to 
the 
next 

generation, passed down like a 
trade. If families in the Midwest 
teach farming and families in 
the Great Lakes region teach 
fishing 
and 
forestry, 
then 

families in Washington, D.C. 
and various state capitols teach 
governance, politics and how 
to hold power. 

Part of this comes from 

the way our selection process 
works — name recognition is 
highly desirable in American 
election 
campaigns. 
Voters 

are often more comfortable 
with 
what 
and 
whom 

they know. This has been 
particularly true in the past 
century. George W. Bush’s 
father was president and his 
great-grandfather was a U.S. 
senator. Both Vice President 
Al Gore and his father were 
senators from Tennessee.

This 
obsessive 
preference 

for whom we recognize exists 
outside of the executive realm, 
too. 
Last 
year, 
Sen. 
Frank 

Murkowski, R-Alaska, gave up 
his seat to become governor. 
He 
carefully 
considered 
24 

Alaskan officials as potential 
replacements and then appointed 
his daughter, Lisa Murkowski.

Rep. 
Charles 
Gonzalez, 

D-Texas, now occupies the seat 
once held by his father. So do 

Reps. Jim Duncan and Harold 
Ford from Tennessee. The 
father of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, 
D-Calif. — the minority leader 
in the House of Representative 
— was a congressman, as well 
as the fathers of current Sens. 
Jon Kyl, Chris Dodd and Bob 
Bennett. It’s tempting to see 
dynastic politics as something 
that died out a while ago — 
maybe in the 1950s, maybe 
earlier — but it appears to be as 
strong as it has ever been.

This tendency was visible 

again 
in 
the 
Democratic 

response to President Donald 
Trump’s State of the Union 
Address — they picked Rep. Joe 
Kennedy III, D-Mass., member 
of the Kennedy dynasty, to 
deliver the speech. Personally, 
I found parts of the speech 
patronizing, 
his 
delivery 

unimpressive and its message 
to be overall quite tepid.

I’ve found it frustrating, 

then, to see news outlets 
marveling 
over 
this 
fresh, 

eloquent, obscure Democrat. 
He’s a Kennedy! What about 
that is groundbreaking? What 
about an heir to America’s most 
famous political family speaks 
to the millions of disadvantaged 
and marginalized Americans 
who make up the core of the 
Democratic party?

This isn’t to say that elites 

and 
insiders 
are 
somehow 

less capable, or should be 
disqualified — look at Franklin 
Roosevelt — but it’s a trend we 
have to be wary of in an era 
where American politics is 
decidedly 
anti-establishment 

and 
anti-elite. 
The 
classic 

model of political legacy and 
personal political brands — in 
my estimation — will become 
a 
liability. 
Regular 
people 

aren’t impressed or reassured 
by famous names; they feel 
alienated by them.

We’re 
familiar 
with 
the 

legacy system of election here 
in Ann Arbor, even — Rep. 
Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., is 
part of a family that’s held 
Michigan’s 12th District since 
1933. To be clear, I think she’s 
entirely capable and represents 
the interests of this district 
well, but her holding office is 
still a striking demonstration 
of how political brands work to 
maintain themselves.

Maybe 
we’re 
always 

going 
to 
be 
susceptible 

to 
political 
brands: 
The 

reliable neoliberalism of the 
Clintons and Obamas; the old 
money progressivism of the 
Kennedys; 
the 
(supposedly) 

charming simplicity of the 
Bush family. In a time when 
the Internet has made media 
even more democratized and 
wide-reaching than it was in 
the TV and radio era, though, 
we might want to shift in a 
different direction.

There 
are 
thousands 
of 

people who — like Barack 
Obama, 
originally 
— 
do 

great 
work 
on 
the 
local 

scale and who are entirely 
capable 
of 
representing 

their communities. The old 
institutions and business of 
Washington, D.C. will survive 
whomever actually holds the 
offices (we’re seeing this with 
Trump), so perhaps it’s time we 
reconsider the idea of effective 
dynasty in American politics. 
Washington doesn’t actually 
need the political class to 
perform its ideal function — 
representing American voters.

T

he 
Central 
Student 

Government 
recently 

published 
a 
“Campus 

Affordability 
Guide,” 
a 
now-

deleted document that consists 
of advice and resources to help 
students more effectively control 
their spending during their time 
in Ann Arbor. The guide was 
quickly met with criticism by some 
students who felt both the material 
and CSG as a whole were out of 
touch with students’ needs and 
reality, especially students from 
low-income backgrounds.

While I disagree with some of 

the arguments made by critics of 
this guide, they were certainly right 
about one thing: CSG is comprised 
of a relatively demographically-
privileged population. According 
to a survey completed by CSG last 
year, their membership is nearly 70 
percent white, 58 percent male and 
37.2 percent come from households 
making $250,000 or more per year.

When 
these 
figures 
are 

compared with the University of 
Michigan’s overall demographics, 
though, a different picture is 
painted. The University’s student 
body 
is 
56.2 
percent 
white, 

students come from a median 
household income of $154,000 and 
the student body is 51.8 percent 
male. So yes, while CSG may, 
in fact, be comprised of a more 
socioeconomically-privileged 
group, the University as a whole 
does not differ greatly.

In consideration of whether 

this Campus Affordability Guide 
is condescending and out of 
touch with low-income students, 
or whether it was produced to 
apply to the greatest number 
of students, we arrive at the 
broader, underlying question. 
CSG is a democratically-elected 
institution meant to reflect the 
demographics and needs of the 
student body. The question — a 
question that applies to really 

any governing body — is how 
should CSG be directing their 
power in order to best represent 
their constituents. Should CSG 
focus on the issues and concerns 
that affect the majority of those 
they were elected to represent, 
or 
should 
they 
focus 
on 

supporting the communities on 
campus that may benefit from 
resources the most?

The answer to this depends on 

one’s view of government and what 
its role should be in our school 
and society as a whole. In my 
opinion, a democratically-elected 
body should exist in order to help 
manage and support the entire 
community. In our situation, the 
community we are talking about is 
the student body of the University. 
In the case of this Campus 
Affordability Guide, CSG decided 
to tackle a problem within our 
campus community that affects, 
what I would assume to be, the 
majority of students. Even if you 
come from a household of means, 
Ann Arbor is still an expensive 
town, and I do not believe many 
students come to school with a 
blank check (even if it may seem 
like that to some).

Reading through the guide, it 

seems that the majority of topics 
seem to be relatable to most 
students. These topics include 
which neighborhoods are more 
expensive than others, how to 
shop and cook more efficiently and 
various ways to reuse or borrow 
resources instead of frequently 
buying new products.

Then, there are the parts of 

the guide deemed to be offensive, 
such as the notion that students 
could save money by doing their 
own laundry rather than using 
a paid laundry service. Another 
recommendation that received 
negative feedback was regarding 
certain recipes to make meals 
in bulk, some of which included 

more high-end ingredients such as 
quinoa and feta cheese. 

I understand how one could 

feel offended or disenfranchised 
when they are told budgeting 
means to do your own laundry 
instead of hiring a service, 
especially 
to 
an 
individual 

working multiple jobs just to 
keep the heat on. With that said, 
this guide, and CSG’s initiatives 
as a whole, are meant for all 
students, including those with 
financial means. And the reality 
is that many students, myself 
included, could certainly benefit 
from much of the advice offered 
in the guide.

I am not suggesting that any 

group on this campus does not 
deserve to have equal resources 
allocated to them, or that they 
should not have their voices heard. 
Rather, I am stating the opposite 
— that even those that come from 
privileged backgrounds deserve the 
school’s resources and to have their 
voices heard as well. In a similar 
note to my last column, there is a 
balance between the two extremes 
of supporting communities on our 
campus that may need more help 
than others, and supporting the 
groups that comprise the majority 
of our campus.

Perhaps this is a balance the 

University and CSG have not 
yet found. At the end of the day, 
CSG is a student organization, 
consisting of individuals with 
limited experience, who are 
learning every day how to better 
do their job. But their intentions 
are clear; they are working to 
make our campus community a 
safer and better place, and I urge 
them to continue with their goal 
of supporting the entire student 
body.

In defense of the ‘Campus Affordability Guide’

MATTHEW FRIEND | COLUMN

I 
 

am 
disgusted 
by 
the 

ways that students at the 
University of Michigan 

distort the concept of a rivalry.

On Saturday, ESPN released 

an investigative report claiming 
the pattern of “widespread 
denial, inaction and information 
suppression” of sexual assault 
allegations at Michigan State 
University extends far beyond 
the disturbing Larry Nassar 
case. The report suggests that 
MSU 
football 
coach 
Mark 

Dantonio and MSU basketball 
coach 
Tom 
Izzo 
may 
be 

complicit in this pattern. Upon 
hearing this, I was horrified 
and heartbroken — if we’ve 
learned anything in the past few 
months, it’s that sexual assault 
is more deeply embedded in our 
culture than we ever could’ve 
imagined. Every time another 
story is uncovered, I become 
absolutely nauseated.

I could not believe my 

eyes 
when 
the 
University 

meme pages, with thousands 
of 
followers 
used 
this 

opportunity to post about 
how pumped they were that, if 
Dantonio and Izzo were fired, 
the University would have a 
bigger chance of beating MSU 
in the upcoming seasons. This 
is a common narrative among 
students as well: “Ha, did you 
hear about MSU? Sucks to be 
a Sparty!”

I hate the Spartans as much 

as anybody. I was raised on 
Michigan football; every fiber 
in my being was taught that 
MSU is annoying, despicable 
and inferior to the University 

in every way. When we lost to 
them in football this year, I 
stormed home from the stadium 
in silence, tears in my eyes, my 
poor roommate afraid to say 
anything to me. When I arrived 
back home, I slammed the door 
to my room and got straight into 
bed without changing out of my 
rain-soaked clothes or taking 
the block ‘M’ sticker off of my 
face. I couldn’t fall asleep all 
night as Dantonio’s face danced 
through my mind, a sinister 
grin on his face, taunting me. If 
anyone understands the weight 
of rivalry, it’s me.

But 
sexual 
assault 
has 

nothing 
to 
do 
with 
this 

rivalry. Sexual assault is an 
entirely 
different 
playing 

field. Sexual assault is a 
wicked force that has, for 
innumerable time, permeated 
every aspect of our culture. 
It is a longstanding part of 
our entertainment industry 
and our political institutions. 
It makes sense for us to be 
disgusted, but probably not 
surprised, that it also plays a 
prominent role in sports.

We should not be using the 

implication of MSU’s athletic 
departments 
in 
sexual-

misconduct suits as another 
opportunity to laugh and taunt 
them with the “little brother” 
cheer. We should support the 
victims, hope that there are 
no other scandals to uncover 
and look into our own athletic 
departments to ensure we’re 
not guilty of the same crimes.

Larry Nassar is a horrible 

human being, and he also 

happens to be one of the 
first 
major 
sexual 
assault 

perpetrators 
within 
college 

sports who is facing serious 
penalties. But I am not going 
to pretend for a minute that 
MSU is the only college in the 
United States that has a pattern 
of “widespread denial, inaction 
and information suppression” 
of sexual assault allegations. 
To anyone who says there is no 
way anything like this would 
happen at our University: Take 
a good hard look at yourself 
and tell me what leads you to 
believe this. Just because we 
like to call ourselves the “best 
university in the world,” are 
we somehow exempt from a 
disease that has infected all of 
Hollywood and Washington, 
D.C.? Sexual assault is a serious 
problem that relies on denial. 
Let’s not be quick to label it as 
MSU’s problem.

I am typically not one to 

say that a rivalry has gone too 
far — I speak of my hatred of 
MSU throughout all of football 
and basketball season with no 
shame or hesitation. But when 
the rivalry extends beyond 
sports and begins to border on 
hoping that the other school 
is guilty of sexual assault, I 
draw the line. If we’re rooting 
to find out that Izzo is guilty 
of inaction regarding sexual 
assault allegations just so he will 
be fired and we will beat them in 
basketball, then that’s it. I’m out 
of this rivalry. I’m done.

Larry Nassar, little brother?

BOOK REVIEW
‘Farewell to the Horse’ 
tells a cultural history

Usually, 
when 
I 
think 
of 
nonfiction, I think of boring, 
textbook-like tomes filled with 
page after page of rigid, unrelenting 
text. Maybe there’ll be a diagram 
or two tossed in there to spice 
things up. Maybe the writer will 
have tried to break up the book’s 
monotony by dividing chapters 
up into bite-sized, ever smaller 
sections. Though Ulrich Raulff’s 
“Farewell to the Horse” is made 
up of four smaller sections, Raulff’s 
thoughtful 
detail 
description 
pushes the book over the delicate 
line that divides boring textbooks 
and quirky nonfiction.
Raulff turns history into a story 
of sorts, told from the horse’s 
point-of-view. In the very first 
passages, he details an amusing 
scene from his past. It’s the mid 
1950s, back when cars and diesel 
powered machines were gradually 
beginning to replace horses as the 
primary means of transportation 
and power. Right in front of 
Raulff’s eyes, his cousin crashes 
a diesel vehicle into a nearby 
fence, becoming so entangled that 
eventually, the only way to extract 
both man and machine is through 
a draft horse — the very animal 
that the former were supposed to 
replace. In a way, it’s also a warning 
for us to never forget our roots.
At one point, Raulff discusses 
how Paris, though one of the 
blooming political, cultural and 
social cities of the world, was 
also a hell for horses; the city’s 

very development was impossible 
without the cheap transportation 
and power that horses provided. 

He details stories of horses in 
war, with photographs of their 
grand bodies lying sprawled in 

abandoned battlefields; in history, 
when they served as the true 
backbone of the Mongol Empire; 

and the role of horses in art as 
inspiration, metaphor and subject. 
He explores bestiality in art, like 
the movie of a pubescent girl, her 
horse and their unshakable bond, 
or even more specifically, the way 
horses show up in Franz Kafka’s 
work.
“Farewell 
to 
the 
Horse” 
implicitly reminds us of how 
far technology, as a whole, has 
progressed. As much as our 
generation loves gizmos, we were 
never alive back when horses were 
essential to daily life, and though 
some of us have deep attachments 
to our cars, rarely, if ever, do most 
people experience that working 
bond between horse and person. 
Carriage rides are novel nowadays, 
something fun to do on Christmas 
Day or a memorable flourish for 
someone’s wedding, but Raulff 
implores us to look past the 
technical pros and cons of times 
long gone and remember the 
animals that carried humanity for 
so long.
“Farewell to the Horse” isn’t a 
nice, light, nighttime read. In fact, 
a majority of the population might 
find it particularly boring; there are 
certainly places in the book where 
the reader can be overwhelmed 
by the sheer density of words on 
the page. As a whole, “Farewell to 
the Horse” sometimes feels like 
a dictionary; one could flip the 
book open to any page and start 
reading without really missing out 
on what came before. But that’s 
where its beauty lies. Sometimes, 
instead of a book that transports 
us to fantastical worlds, we want 
something to ground us in our own.

Revisiting: ‘Glee’ grows 
stale with passing time

Contrary to popular belief, 
all things do not, in fact, get 
better with time. And “Glee” 
is most definitely one of those 
things. I’d even go so far as to 
contend that it should have 
been first on the list of relics to 
be left and buried in, say, 2012 
— at the end of season three.
Don’t get me wrong, though. 
“Glee” was an absolute hit 
almost a decade ago. A gem 
of its time. It gave way to a 
national tour, a 3D concert 

movie, mountains of tween 
merchandise, multiple albums 
(full of covers that are still bops 
to this day, might I add) and a 
die-hard, swooning fanbase of 
‘gleeks’ armed with pom-poms 
and slushies. It’s just that now, 
in revisiting “Glee” after all 
these years, it was mostly just a 
pretty weird — and oftentimes 
cringe-worthy — experience.
Let’s begin by going back 
to the era of “Glee” where the 
series was endearing and truly 
a spectacle. That is, seasons 
one through three. It’s a tale 
as old as time: A high school 
harshly divided between jocks 
and nerds finds a motley crew 
of glee club members desperate 
to enter the popularity sphere. 
The characters are all so young 
and doe-eyed, struggling to 
develop a sense of their own 
identities as well as discovering 
where they fit in among others 
at McKinley High.
There is Rachel, a singer 
with 
huge 
aspirations 
of 
stardom 
and 
an 
extreme 
infatuation with a quarterback, 
Finn. Then there’s Kurt, an 
extravagant powerhouse who 
wrestles with his own self-
expression and coming-out to 
his ultra-conservative father. 
And there’s also Quinn, the 
lead cheerleader, main mean 
girl 
and 
president 
of 
the 
abstinence club — who just 
so happens to have gotten 
pregnant by a boy who is not 
her boyfriend. Somehow, no 
matter how different these and 
the other characters may seem, 
they all end up in the glee club 
fighting to win a national title 
and trying to prove that show 
choir can be cool. That sense of 
unity and family is extremely 
lovable and is what kept so 
many coming back for more 
delightful drama.
But there are also many, 
many places where “Glee” 
misstepped along the way, 
and looking back now it’s 

hard to believe that more 
people didn’t notice. First off, 
the musical numbers are all 
horribly autotuned. While I’m 
sure that was the style a few 
years ago, now it only comes 
off as very cheesy and ruins 
some of the magic of the show. 
Also, logistics are pretty much 
thrown out the window, as a 
majority of the plot meanders 
and drags on, and many of 
the scenarios are in no way 
practical. Why do we rarely 
see the glee club practicing the 
songs they are actually going 
to sing at competitions? How 
do they put those numbers 
together so quickly? So many 
questions, so few answers.
And most problematic of 
them all, for being a show 
branded 
on 
heavy 
and 
diversified representation, it 
feels like a lot of the diversity 
within 
the 
characters 
is 
done simply to check boxes 
and label the leads. We see 
the gay boy, the Jewish kids, 
the lesbians, the soulful and 
sassy Black girl and the shy 
Asians — but their character 
traits are so intensified and 
exaggerated that the so-called 
“representation” 
turns 
into 
done-for-comedic-effect 
stereotyping.
“Glee” had its hot and 
cold moments, but I have 
never seen a show fall faster 
downhill than it did after the 
conclusion of season three. 
At this point, many of our 
favorites had graduated from 
McKinley and had moved on 
to either travel far away from 
Lima, Ohio, enroll in college or 
join the military — leaving the 
school glee club with a mere 
sampling of B-list younger 
members and a fresh crop of 
eager participants.
Let me say that there are 
few things more frustrating 
than when a series brings in 
new faces to casually try and 
replace characters that have 
either graduated, died or for 
some reason left the show. But 
that is exactly what “Glee” 
tried to do beginning in season 
four — and it failed miserably. 
While the show was split-
screened between following 
the storyline at McKinley High 
and following Rachel and Kurt 
in their adventures in star-
studded New York, now “Glee” 
had lost a lot of its allure and 
simply felt like a flawed spin-
off.
Ultimately, there is no way 
to accurately encapsulate all 
of the moments where, against 
all odds, “Glee” worked. But in 
choosing three episodes chock 
full of drama, full-out musical 
numbers and all the feels, I will 
attempt to memorialize “Glee” 
for its good times, rather than 
its bad.
1. 
“Never 
Been 
Kissed”: 
season 2, episode 6
One of the beloved mash-
up contest episodes, “Never 
Been Kissed” is a standout 
because it actually takes some 
of the spotlight off of New 
Directions and introduces us 
to their competition — The 
Warblers of Dalton Academy. 
It is here that we meet Blaine 
— played immaculately by the 
University’s own Darren Criss 
— and begin to fall in love. 
It is through his passionate 
rendition of “Teenage Dream” 
and instant draw to a suddenly 

introverted 
Kurt 
that 
we 
realize just how influential 
Blaine 
will 
be 
to 
Kurt’s 
currently 
dwindling 
self-
esteem and acceptance of his 
genuine self. This episode is 
charming not only because 
of this budding romance, but 
also because it carries the 
overarching heartfelt message 
that if it takes some time and 
a little help from others to 
embrace who you are, that’s 
perfectly OK.
2. “Nationals”: season 3, 
episode 21
It is through “Nationals” 
that we are fulfilled as “Glee” 
watchers, as New Directions 
finally win a national title 
and make all of those hours 
of binging worth it. It’s a 
true rallying cry as all forces 
come together, even including 
Sue Sylvester to pull out a 
win and overcome the odds. 
This episode also features 
some of the strongest musical 
moments of the entire series, 
as 
the 
New 
Directions’ 
nationals setlist may be one of 
the greatest, most emotional 
musical montages ever filmed. 
With no lack of instances 
documenting sheer unity and 
togetherness, if there is one 
episode to be thought of when 
immortalizing “Glee” forever, 
this should definitely be it.

3. “The Break Up”: season 4, 
episode 4
Leading up to a five-week 
hiatus 
after 
its 
real-time 
premiere, “The Break Up” left 
viewers feeling empty and 
on the edge of their seats as 
everyone’s 
favorite 
couples 
disbanded in a tear-jerking 
mosaic. I mean, how could you 
not cry when couples that we’ve 
seen grow up together — Finn 
and Rachel, Kurt and Blaine 
and 
Santana 
and 
Brittany 
— are forced to say goodbye 
and let go of their first loves. 
This episode is memorable 
not only because of the strong 
emotional reaction it provokes, 
but also because most of the 
heavy 
moments 
and 
deep 
conversations are executed in 
true “Glee” fashion: through 
song. 
Each 
character 
is 
released from the bonds that 
hold them back to McKinley, 
and set free to rightfully chase 
their own goals and dreams. 
As the spotlight dims on Finn 
at the end of the sentimental 
group performance of “The 
Scientist,” we gain closure 
in the fact that the original, 
pure and captivating chapter 
of “Glee” that we grew such 
a fond connection to had now 
closed.

TV SERIES


Every year during awards 
season, several indie films fall 
under the radar. This year, 
“The Florida Project,” “A Ghost 
Story,” “Good Time” and many 
more did not receive the praise 
they deserved from the Academy 
Awards 
or 
Golden 
Globes. 
Instead, the same formula of 
period pieces matched with 
high caliber Hollywood names 
make the ballot. One of those 
films worthy of a nod is “Beach 
Rats,” a movie that draws many 
parallels to the nominated “Call 
Me By Your Name.” Even crabby 
critic Richard Brody of The New 
Yorker agrees, placing “Beach 
Rats” on his Oscar nominations 
wishlist for Best Actor and Best 
Cinematography.
“Beach Rats” tackles the same 
subject matter as “Call Me By 
Your Name.” A teen boy, Frankie 
(newcomer Harris Dickinson), 
tries to figure out his sexuality. 
However, unlike the idealistic 
approach of “Call Me By Your 
Name,” “Beach Rats” embraces 
a grungier, more cynical take. 
Frankie spends his time with 
a group of derelict boys who 
mostly use him for access to 
drugs. Their macho attitude 
clouds his view of the world and 

increases his shame towards his 
sexuality. As Frankie deals with 
family tragedy and addiction, 
he ventures into the dangerous 
world of online chat rooms. His 
fear of being discovered leads 
to secret encounters with older 
men in the shady corners of 
Coney Island.
The dream-like atmosphere 
of “Call Me By Your Name” 
makes it a more digestible film. 
Set in a romanticized Italy in 
the 1980s when online predators 
did not yet exist, Director Luca 
Guadagnino created a movie 
about the pureness of love. 
Elio 
(Timothee 
Chalamet, 
“Lady 
Bird”) 
and 
Oliver 
(Armie Hammer, “The Social 
Network”) treat each other with 
tenderness. Elio’s parents offer 
him emotional support, and his 
circumstances are those of a 
rich teenager with little to rebel 
against. Although still risque, 
“Call Me By Your Name” is a 
film that a wider audience can 
enjoy.
In contrast, “Beach Rats” 
emphasizes exploitation, most 
notably that of its actors’ bodies. 
Guadagnino cut moments of 
nudity from the original script 
of “Call Me By Your Name,” 
and 
the 
camera 
noticeably 
pans away from such scenes. 
Writer-director Eliza Hittman 
of “Beach Rats” lets the full-
frontal nudity of male characters 

pervade the screen (though 
she leaves the female body 
more concealed). “Beach Rats” 
shatters any romantic notions 
of young love — pairing a tough 
story with cinematography that 
stresses harsh lighting and the 
bright colors of Coney Island’s 
rides, arcades and fireworks. 
As Frankie walks along the 
beach, a sharp spotlight follows 
him, giving little depth of field 
and only a cold, judgemental 
illumination.
The two films broach the 
same difficult topic, but one 
has risen to prominence and 
popular discourse while the 
other has fallen into obscurity. 
“Beach Rats” has rougher edges 
and less star power (most of 
the cast are first-timers), yet 
it 
accomplishes 
something 
beautiful. Its rawness is what 
packs the real punch. Hittman 
is not interested in crafting a 
love story, she instead exposes 
the dangers of toxic masculinity 
and the various pressures that 
prey on the psyche of a young 
man. Dickinson holds up his 
end of the bargain, showing 
Frankie’s inner conflict with 
every chippy response, avoided 
glance and general air of self-
denial. The Oscars may have 
ignored this quiet masterpiece, 
but the rest of the world should 
give “Beach Rats” the applause 
it deserves.

MUSIC REVIEW 

ATLANTIC RECORDS

If the music of Rae Morris 
could be described in one 
word, it would undoubtedly 
be haunting. Not in a spooky, 
or even uncanny way — her 
songs stick in the back of your 
mind for weeks at a time, the 
melodies high and memorable, 
ethereal 
even. 
Her 
first 
album, 2015’s Unguarded, was 
a stepping point for Morris 
into the world of synthesized 
music 
from 
her 
previous 
stripped-back 
EPs, 
while 

maintaining 
this 
haunting 
quality all the while. She found 
some success in this. Her 

song “Don’t Go” was featured 
on the UK television series 
“Skins” — a point from which 
her career broke out. Now, 
with her sophomore effort, 
Someone Out There, Morris 
has 
successfully 
translated 

the emotional poignancy of 
her originally simple style into 
the dance sphere, creating an 
album which merges electronic 
production and her talent for 
songwriting which pierces to 
the core.
Someone Out There is a 
well-balanced 
mix 
of 
this 
songwriting 
with 
new 
techniques 
for 
Morris, 
featuring shorter, more hook-
centered tunes than in the past. 
Despite these changes, her elfin 
voice and knack for writing 
cohesive and interesting songs 
still shine through, arguably 
even more than in her previous 
releases.

‘RuPaul’s Drag Race All 
Stars 3’ is still necessary

VH1

Even though “RuPaul’s Drag 
Race” has been airing since 
2010, the series has only broken 
into the public consciousness 
recently. 
Features 
in 
major 
publications like The New York 
Times Magazine, Entertainment 
Magazine, Paper Magazine and 
Time Magazine have ushered 
in a newfound fame for host 
RuPaul Charles (“Broad City”). 
After taking cues from other 
entertainment reality programs, 
like 
“Project 
Runway” 
and 
“America’s Next Top Model,” 
RuPaul created “Drag Race” for 
Logo TV — bringing the show 
to the more accessible channel 
VH1 in only seven years. All 
in all, the story of “Drag Race” 
is a story of finding a popular 
audience. There may be little 
surprise, then, when I tell you 
that the third season premiere 
of “RuPaul’s Drag Race All 
Stars” is as good as the attention 
it’s getting.
After 11 seasons in total, the 
series has gotten comfortable in 
its own shoes, and the premiere 
reflects it perfectly. For those 
that are unfamiliar, “RuPaul’s 
Drag Race All Stars” is a reality 
competition 
program 
where 
a handful of drag queens are 
brought in to perform for a panel 
of judges. Challenges vary from 
the direct (a stand-up comedy 
show, “Revenge of the Queens,” 
All Stars Two) to the very 
convoluted (write, produce and 
act in a scripted television pilot, 

“Your Pilot’s on Fire,” season 
nine), but all fall under the 
umbrella of drag. For “All Stars,” 
the producers bring back queens 
from older seasons for one more 
shot at the crown.
The 
12th 
time 
around, 
the 
show 
knows 
what 
it’s 
doing. There is little need for 
introduction 
to 
the 
format 

or 
any 
of 
the 
competing 
queens; each of them enters 
the workroom in their first 
look, in what is their official 
reintroduction to the public 
eye. The cast draws mostly from 
later 
seasons 
(Bendelacreme 
and Milk from season six, Trixie 
Mattel and Kennedy Davenport 
from season seven) but feature 
a few from earlier seasons, and 
even one past winner — Bebe 
Zahara 
Benet 
from 
season 
one. Her appearance may be a 
sort of second shot, since the 
progression of the series has led 
to massive upticks in budget and 
quality.
The 
main 
challenge 
for 
the season opener is a variety 
show — the same challenge 
in the first episode of “All 
Stars 2.” From the looks of it, 
“All Stars 3” is ramping up to 
mimic the challenge arc from 
its predecessor, providing a 
predictability that the show 
can rely on. With the variety of 

talent — from the passionate and 
explosive dancers to the more 
mellow and restrained musical 
performers — a set format 
provides stability in a show that 
can come off the rails at times. 
While it is true that some of 
the best moments on “RuPaul’s 
Drag Race” are when the queens 
take total control of a brand new 
challenge (“Totally Leotarded” 
from season three, “Wrestling’s 
Trashiest Fighters” from season 
four), others fall completely flat 
(“RuPaul’s Gaff-In” from “All 
Stars 1,” “She Done Already 
Done Brought It On” from 
season nine).
While I won’t reveal the 
winner or eliminee of the first 
episode, I will tell you that 
the season premiere shows a 
breadth of talent that many 
other reality shows are lacking. 
You’ve 
got 
comedy, 
dance, 
music and of course a killer 
lip-sync performance at the 
end of the episode — but you 
know that already! “RuPaul’s 
Drag Race All Stars” continues 
to be on the cutting-edge of 
reality programming, launching 
the careers of over a hundred 
entertainers and providing a 
real, honest platform for the 
gay 
community. 
While 
its 
integration into the mainstream 
may have led to some erasure 
of 
the 
grittier, 
true-to-life 
elements of drag performance, 
the show elevates drag to a 
higher art form, giving an 
occasionally 
unsuspecting 
audience the experience of the 
finest queer performers. There 
is little on television as vital as 
“RuPaul’s Drag Race.”

Rae Morris is haunting 
on ‘Someone Out There’

on 
a 
reflective 
and, 
well, 
haunting 
note 
with 
“Push 
Me to my Limit,” its droning, 
synthy beginning reminiscent 
of an orchestra tuning which 
tumbles 
into 
a 
reflective 
meditation 
on 
relationships 
which challenge and fulfill. 
She experiments with unique 
vocals in “Wait for the Rain,” 
similar 
to 
groundbreaking 
artists 
like 
Aphex 
Twin. 
“Push” is not the only slower, 
somber addition to Someone 
Out There, but the highlights 
of the record fall with her 

more upbeat compositions, like 
“Atletico (The Only One)” and 
“Dip My Toe,” which explore 
the 
dynamics 
of 
sex 
and 
compatibility with lyrics that 
expand on Morris’s interesting 
artistic perspective.
Out of every song on the new 
album, the standout is definitely 
dance anthem “Do It” — the 
first single from Someone Out 
There and arguably Morris’s 
most popular tune to date. It 
manages to meld her trademark 
emotional affect with a typical 
repetitive 
electronica 
hook, 

an incredibly catchy refrain 
which makes it hard not to start 
dancing whenever a listener 
hears it. “Do It” is a perfect 
example of how an artist 
can change and still retain 
their core sensibility while 
improving, using production to 
only enhance what was there 
before. If there is anything that 
could be recommended from 
this album, it would be that 
song — it serves as a poster child 
for Morris’s talent and bravado, 
a tipping point towards the 
celebration her work deserves.

women’s basketball team

and losing at Rutgers
» Page 4B

It was deja vu all over again 

for the Wolverines.

A stodgy first half. A second-

half spurt. A collapse at the 
end. A three to tie it.

Against Maryland, guard 

Kevin Huerter drained a cold-
blooded three to tie the game, 
with the Terrapins smelling 
a potential upset bid. On that 
night, the Wolverines executed 
their last-second play to 
perfection, finding a charging 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman as he bullied his 
way to the hoop. On that night, 
Abdur-Rahkman drained both 
free throws to escape with a 
win.

On Saturday, Abdur-

Rahkman caught the inbounds 
pass with 3.3 seconds left, 
found a wall of Minnesota 
defenders, and hurled up 
something resembling an off-
balance three. Needless to say 
it didn’t fall.

But once again, Michigan 

(19-6 overall, 8-4 Big Ten) 
escaped with a win in a game 
filled with self-inflicted 
wounds. Once again, Abdur-
Rahkman would be the hero.

With 3.8 seconds left, 

Abdur-Rahkman made up for 
his end-of-regulation miss with 

the decisive moment of the 

game, as he attacked the 

hoop, spun to his left 

and made the layup 

with a foul.

“I just looked 
up the 
floor and 
surveyed 
the floor, 
and saw there 
was nobody 
under the 
basket,” Abdur-
Rahkman said. 

“So I knew that if 

I could get downhill 

there wouldn’t be a help 

defender. Once he cut me off I 
just thought I should probably 
spin.”

Once again, the Wolverines 

pulled a rabbit out of their 
hat in a game they tried 
desperately to lose, topping 
Minnesota (14-11, 3-9), 76-73, 

in a bewildering back and forth 
slugfest.

For much of the night, 

though, Gophers’ guard Isaiah 
Washington imposed his will. 
Washington came into the 
game averaging 6.9 points per 
game on 32 percent from the 
field, and left Crisler with a 
26-point outburst on 11-of-16 
from the field.

While Michigan struggled 

to contain Minnesota’s guards 
on one end, the offensive 
struggles remained an equally 
persistent problem for a team 
that has taken a propensity to 
slow starts. The Wolverines 
shot just 34 percent from the 
field and 29 percent from three 
in the first half, heading to the 
locker room down 34-32.

Michigan 

has now shot 
37 percent 
or below 
and scored 
32 points or 
fewer in five 
of its last six 
first halves.

And as 

bad as things 
may have 
gotten from 
the field, 
the most 
alarming statistic came at the 
free-throw line. Michigan shot 
just 12-for-28 on the night.

“It’s all mental,” Abdur-

Rahkman said. “You get up 
there to the line, people think 
too much. You get a clear 
head. We literally do this 
everyday and guys shoot good 
percentages in practices.”

Added Beilein: “It’s not 

mechanical right now. They’ve 
got to go up there with some 
confidence. We’ve got to get 
them right. That’s my job.”

Yet as things remained grim 

the Wolverines somehow found 
a way to stay competitive.

In need of a pick-me-

up in the second half, the 
Wolverines turned to their 
star center to turn the tide. 
First, Wagner drained a 
3-pointers from the corner 
to close the gap to two 
points. Then, he corraled 
two consecutive offensive 
rebounds to keep possessions 
alive. The majority of second-
half offensive possessions 

centered around pick-and-
roll action with the German 
center. He scored 16 points on 
the day.

And, perhaps most 

impressively, Wagner stared 
one of his most physical one-
on-one matchups of the season 
in the face and overpowered 
him. 

Minnesota forward Jordan 

Murphy came into the game 
averaging 18 points and 12 
rebounds per game, fourth 
in the nation in the latter 
category. Not only did Wagner 
dazzle offensively, but he 
topped Murphy on the boards 
— with 10 to Murphy’s 6 — and 
held the Gophers’ star in check 
offensively. Wagner called that 
“the key to winning this game.” 

Murphy would 
later foul out in 
overtime with 
just 12 points.

Despite 

Murphy’s 
struggles, 
though, 
Washington 
and Mason 
continued to 
wreak havoc 
on Michigan’s 
defense. They 
combined 

to score 48 of the Gophers’ 
73 points, with an array of 
offensive moves and tough 
shots. The guard tandem was 
effective enough to force the 
Wolverines into a zone midway 
through the second half, a 
rarity in assistant coach Luke 
Yaklich’s man-centric defense. 
It was Yaklich who decided the 
zone would be the only way to 
combat the dynamic duo.

“That was Luke Yaklich 

all the way,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “We felt, 
when you get a guy like Mason 
and Washington — they were 
15-for-22 at that time — they 
have what we need to go 
recruit: guys who can make 
tough twos. They were making 
tough twos. They were making 
them. We said, ‘Well, the only 
way we can possibly stop this is 
change what we’re doing.’ ”

As the clock began to wind 

down, Michigan appeared 
headed toward a close victory. 
Up three points with 20 
seconds left in regulation, 

Robinson caught the ball in 
the corner, as two defenders 
tried to wrestle the ball from 
him. While a foul appeared 
immiment, the referees instead 
blew the whistle for a travel, 
handing possession back 
to Minnesota with one last 
chance.

“I have no idea what 

happened on that play,” Beilein 
said. There’s a cylinder when 
you’re pivoting, they can’t be in 
your cylinder. If he walked I’m 
sure it must have been blatant 
for the officials. If not, that’s 
really a bad call.”

Mason took that break and 

snatched the momentum right 
back.

With just five seconds left, 

Mason drained a 3-pointer 
to send it to overtime after 
Michigan missed a switch on a 
screen.

In overtime, the free-throw 

disaster continue to plague the 
Wolverines. Sophomore guard 
Zavier Simpson missed two key 
attempts to potentially extend 
the lead to three. Washington 
answered on the other end, 
making two free throw to take 
back the lead. On the next 
possession, Matthews barely 
clanked home the first and 
missed the next.

Tied at 71. One minute left.
As the teams traded buckets 

in the final minute, Abdur-
Rahkman got his chance 
at redemption with nine 
seconds left. For a senior just 
starting to develop into the 
go-to option late in games, 
every opportunity is a work in 
progress. He made the most of 
this one.

“I wouldn’t say that I’ve 

been in that position before,” 
Abdur-Rahkman said. “But 
I’ve been in games, tight 
games, NCAA Tournament and 
stuff like that. It’s definitely 
something that’s developing. 
I’ve just got to continue to 
grow.”

It was an emphatic finish to 

a most uneven performance. 
There was as much 
exasperation as enthusiasm 
after the game.

“I’ll take the W,” Beilein 

muttered as he walked off the 
podium after his postgame 
press conference. “I need a 
nap.”

Poor free-throw shooting nearly dooms Michigan in win over Minnesota

When his team isn’t hitting 

free throws, John Beilein has 
simple advice: picture your loved 
ones.

“I usually tell them to think 

about their mother … relax them 
a bit.”

Beilein admitted he didn’t 

relay the message to his team 
on Saturday against Minnesota, 
only one miscue of many that 
contributed to the Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
teams 
foul 

shooting woes. Despite a 76-73 
overtime victory over the Golden 
Gophers, the stench of a 12-for-
28 performance from the charity 
stripe reeked and lingered.

“I didn’t look at the box score 

because I’m just very happy we 
won,” said junior forward Moritz 
Wagner. “Obviously we weren’t 
shooting well (from the line), but 
the good thing is we can learn 
from victory now and not from 
defeat.”

At many times throughout 

the game, the misses seemed 
unfortunate, but non-essential. 
The Wolverines, victims of a two-
point halftime deficit thanks to 
tactical scoring by Minnesota’s 
backcourt, shot 5-for-6 from the 
line in the first half. Redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 
Charles 

Matthews missed six consecutive 
free throws in the first six 
minutes of the second half, and 
Michigan was still within three 
points.

The 
moans 
and 
muddled 

chatter of fans at Crisler Center 
longing for a made free throw 
were audible, but hope still 
didn’t waver. Then sophomore 
center Jon Teske bricked the 
front end of a one-and-one, the 
Golden Gophers’ lead ballooned 
to ten the next possession and the 
restlessness escalated.

“It’s basically like a turnover 

when you miss two free throws,” 
said senior guard Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman. 
“You’re 

turning the ball over, you don’t 
get that possession. And then it’s 
tough, you gotta make at least 
one.”

Down only one point with four 

minutes remaining in the second 
half, Abdur-Rahkman — a 91 
percent free throw shooter before 
Saturday’s contest — drew a foul, 
and the arena exhaled in relief. 
But the senior promptly bounced 
the ball off the iron and out. Both 
times. 

A 6-0 Michigan run gave it a 

five-point lead with 18 seconds to 
go, Abdur-Rahkman went to the 
line again to put the game to bed. 
Once again, two misses for the 
typically rock-solid foul shooter.

Abdur-Rahkman called it a 

rare “mental block.” Minnesota 
charged down the court with a 
layup, forced a turnover on the 
inbounds pass and hit a three to 
tie the game. One more made free 
throw amongst a 5-for-17 second-
half showing would have made 
the Golden Gophers’ comeback 
efforts obsolete — no overtime 
and a quicker win. But that wasn’t 
the case.

In the extra period, free throws 

once again almost doomed the 
Wolverines. With 1:45 remaining, 
sophomore point guard Zavier 
Simpson — a 50 percent free 
throw shooter — clinked two 
off the rim with only a one point 
advantage. After a Minnesota 
bucket, Matthews hit only one of 
two free throws to tie the game 
at 71.

For Beilein, the free throw 

issues facing his team had him 
digging 35 years into the archives 
of his coaching career.

“I think of my Le Moyne team,” 

Beilein said, reflecting on his 
nine-year stint with the school. 
“We had a bunch of big guys in 
1983 or ‘84 that was the same 
thing. It’s been a good 30 some 
years since then we’ve had this 
issue. … If you hear frustration 
from me it’s because I can’t find 
the answer yet. And I don’t recall 
having it except for 30 years ago.”

With four seconds on the clock 

in a tied contest, Abdur-Rahkman 
drove to the hoop, pirouetted 
around his defender while getting 
fouled and converted a layup. 
Fittingly, after facing palpable 
uncertainty at the line, Abdur-
Rahkman dribbled, relaxed his 

shoulders and calmly sunk the 
and-one foul shot, leaving the 
Golden Gophers to chuck up a 
deep prayer that wouldn’t fall.

In 
the 
post-game 
press 

conference, Beilein praised the 
Michigan’s defense and showed 
gratitude that his team could 

somehow pull out the win. The 
free throw woes, on the other 
hand, are something he would 
like some help with.

“We’re ready for anything right 

now,” Beilein said. “A hypnotist? I 
wanna find out everything we can 
do right now.”

Redshirt sophomore wing Charles Matthews and Michigan struggled at the line in a 76-73 overtime win over Minnesota.

Hanging on

I

t’s not too often that a vic-
tory prompts cautionary 
words.

But Friday 

night, Mel 
Pearson 
proved to be 
an exception 
to the rule. 
His Michigan 
hockey team 
(8-10-2 Big 
Ten, 13-13-2 
overall) came 
away with 
a 5-3 win 
against No. 18 Wisconsin (8-9-
2-1, 14-13-3), but after taking 
a three-goal lead into the 
third period, the 20th-ranked 
Wolverines let their foot off 
the pedal.

The Badgers lit the lamp 

twice in the final frame and 
pulled their goaltender early in 
an attempt to turn what looked 
like a blowout into a far more 
competitive contest. And yet, 
Dakota Raabe’s open-netter 
proved to be Michigan’s saving 
grace.

Wisconsin’s resurgence, 

though, left something to be 
desired from Pearson.

“Discipline was not good,” 

he said after the game. “You 
could see right at the start of 
the second period after we got 
the lead that they were gonna 
come out and play physical 
and try to get us off our game 
a little bit. And they did a good 
job, and we fell right into it.

“… We’ve gotta understand 

that we have to stick to our 
game plan, we have to play 
with that poise and that 
patience. We have to learn how 
to play with a lead and do the 
things that got us that lead, 
and I thought we got away 
from that.”

The Wolverines, however, 

never got the chance to play 
with a lead again on the 
weekend. The Badgers buried 
Michigan with a four-goal 
deficit in the second period 

Saturday night and never 
looked back.

The loss, perhaps, made 

Pearson’s comments from 
Friday night even more 
illuminating.

Pearson said 

Friday night’s 
victory gave 
Michigan a 
chance to have 
a “heck of a 
weekend.” It 
would have 
been a heck of a 
weekend indeed 
— one that could 
have marked the 
Wolverines’ third sweep over 
a ranked opponent in their last 
four series. Instead, they were 
forced to settle for a split.

It was Friday night, too, 

that Pearson was asked about 
Raabe’s progress, only to shift 

his answer toward a more 
holistic evaluation of this 
Michigan hockey team.

“Our team has tremendous 

room for growth, I talk about 

that all the 
time,” he said 
then. “And you 
can see it in 
little doses. Now 
we’ve gotta just 
continue to do 
that all the time, 
and continue to 
come out of our 
comfort zone.”

That same 

optimistic 

outlook for the Wolverines’ 
progress, however, was 
measured with a dose of 
reality.

“We’re running out of time,” 

Pearson said. “Our seniors are 
running out of games. We’ve 

gotta grab it and run with it. 
We grabbed it and started 
to run a little bit, and then 
decided we were gonna slow 
down.”

Such is the 

reality for 
Michigan.

On Jan. 12, 

the Wolverines 
began a four-
game unbeaten 
streak — 
sweeping then-
No. 9 Minnesota 
at Mariucci 
Arena before 
sweeping then-
No. 12 Penn State at home, too.

Since then, as Pearson 

put it, Michigan has slowed 
down. The Wolverines went 
to Columbus only to be 
unceremoniously swept by the 
sixth-ranked Buckeyes.

This weekend, at least in 

part, was another hiccup.

Make no mistake; with six 

teams — including Michigan 
— ranked in the top-20 

nationally, 
sweeps are 
hard to come 
by in this year’s 
iteration of the 
Big Ten. But 
at this point, 
they may be 
necessary.

The 

Wolverines 
currently sit 
16th in the 

Pairwise rankings. Taken 
at face value, that would 
put Michigan in the NCAA 
Tournament for the first time 
since the 2015-16 season.

But the Pairwise rankings 

are not an exact science, and 

with three Big Ten programs 
ranked higher, it’d be more 
accurate to say the Wolverines’ 
aspirations of joining the 
16-team field are sitting on the 
bubble.

That bubble very well may 

pop, which leaves little room 
for error in the coming weeks. 
Michigan will close out its 
regular season slate with a 
series against Michigan State, 
No. 2 Notre Dame and Arizona 
State.

It’s a six-game stretch that 

is simultaneously dangerous 
and enticing. Losses to the 
Spartans or Sun Devils could 
jeopardize a season-long 
resume. A win, or two, against 
the Fighting Irish could make 
the postseason selection much 
easier.

But as the Wolverines found 

out both Friday and Saturday 
— and have found out plenty 
of times this season — if they 
stray from the system Pearson 
is so desperate to implement 
for good, they could very well 
end up on the wrong side of 
that hypothetical.

“We’ve got to understand 

that, and until we do we’re 
gonna hold on for our dear 
lives in games like this against 
good teams,” Pearson said 
Friday. “They’re all good 
teams, and you give them a 
little momentum, a little bit of 
spark, (and) it’s like that dry 
kindling. You pour some gas 
on it, all of sudden you decide 
you’re gonna put one match on 
it and boom, and now you’re 
just holding on.”

And as the season continues 

to wane, one thing is clear: In 
its next six contests, Michigan 
won’t just be holding on to 
games. The Wolverines will 
be holding on to an ending — 
and beginning — to Pearson’s 
inaugural season.

‘M’ holds on against No. 15 Nebraska

Joe McFarland was fired up.
As the Michigan wrestling 

coach gestured to the crowd to 
stand up and make some noise, 
McFarland himself was bouncing 
around the bench.

The Michigan faithful inside 

Cliff Keen Arena answered his 
call and energized 165-pound 
redshirt sophomore Logan Massa 
as he scored a pivotal two-point 
takedown 
in 
sudden-death 

overtime.

Massa’s victory all but solidified 

a hard fought dual-meet win for 
the 
fourth-ranked 
Wolverines 

(6-1 Big Ten, 9-2 overall) against 
No. 15 Nebraska (5-2 Big Ten, 7-4 
overall).

Coming off of a huge road win 

against Iowa last week, there 
was 
some 
concern 
Michigan 

would overlook the Cornhuskers. 
Though this apprehension was 
eased by the end of the night, few 
of the Wolverines’ seven wins 
appeared to come easy.

“That’s the crazy thing about 

the Big Ten in wrestling is that 
every week you’re going to have 
a tough opponent,” said 184-
pound fifth-year senior Domenic 
Abounader. “You get a day or two 
to dwell on it and look at the tape to 

see what you did wrong and what 
you did right and how you can get 
better. But in four, five days you’re 
going to have another tough kid.”

Abounader’s victory got the ball 

rolling for the Wolverines after a 
lottery had determined the dual-
meet would start at 184 pounds 
instead of 125, as meets typically 
do. Fifth-year senior heavyweight 
Adam Coon recorded a technical 
fall to bring his record to 20-0 on 
the season, while No. 5 133-pound 
redshirt sophomore Stevan Micic 
also did enough to earn a major-
decision win.

With that being said, Michigan 

did slip up a few times throughout 
the night. Despite beating the fifth-
ranked wrestler in the 197-pound 
weight class last week, fifth-year 
senior Kevin Beazley suffered 
an upset loss to his Nebraska 
opponent.

One of the team’s mantras this 

season has been staying aggressive 
and pouncing on every point rather 
than simply defending a lead. At 
times, the Wolverines seemed to 
get away from that.

“I addressed that in the locker 

room with the guys,” McFarland 
said. “You can’t start looking at the 
clock. You start doing that and you 
start defending and bad things are 
going to happen. We saw that at a 
couple of weight classes tonight. 

Kevin’s got to wrestle a complete 
match. If he wrestles a complete 
match, he beats that kid every 
time.”

Overall, 
though, 
the 
team 

collected itself right when things 
seemed to be getting too close for 
comfort. Michigan was up just 
15-10 prior to back-to-back star 
performances from Massa and 
redshirt junior Alec Pantaleo. 
Pantaleo came alive in the third 
period of his match at 157 pounds, 
scoring a final second takedown to 
punctuate his win.

“He put an exclamation point on 

that match,” McFarland said. “And 
the fans appreciated it, they loved 
it. They went crazy.”

If the crowd was raucous after 

Pantaleo’s win, Massa’s nearly 
brought the roof off of the building. 
Having battled through injuries all 
season, he won for the first time in 
five matches.

“Can’t tell you the last time I lost 

four matches in a season let alone 
a row,” Massa said. “So, mentally 
I wasn’t all there. I’ve just been in 
the room working my butt off like 
six hours a day with the coaches.”

Added 
McFarland: 
“Logan 

needed that win. He dug down 
deep and gutted out a tough, hard-
fought win and he needed that. 
That’s going to help him down the 
road.”

Wolverines slip past No. 6 Ohio State

The pressure of going last is no 

problem for Dmitri Belanovski.

The senior knew the stakes 

when he stepped up to the high 
bar for the No. 7 Michigan 
men’s gymnastics team’s final 
routine of the day. A poor 
performance would have meant 
a second consecutive loss for the 
Wolverines, but Belanovski hit 
a high bar routine packed with 
difficult releases and ended with 
a stuck dismount to give the 
team its first win of the season, 
defeating No. 6 Ohio State.

“I love going last. When the 

pressure’s on, I’m usually at my 
best,” Belanovski said. “That’s 
what I’m here for.”

Michigan 
opened 
the 

competition on floor exercise, 
where freshman Jacob Moore 
stuck multiple tumbling passes, 
including his final triple full, on 
his way to a score of 14.950 — the 
new NCAA-leading score on floor.

Following Moore was Anthony 

McCallum. The junior fell on his 
first tumbling pass, then went 
down on his third pass with an 
injury.

However, the Wolverines were 

able to bounce back when junior 
Emyre Cole flew high on his 
tumbling passes in an energetic 
routine to score 14.50 and place 
second on the event.

Michigan had difficulty on 

pommel horse, with freshman 
Cameron Bock and junior Mack 
Lasker both falling during their 
routines. Moore and junior Uche 
Eke earned the team’s top scores 
on pommel horse, scoring 13.85 
and 13.75, respectively.

After competing in just two 

meets in 2017 and missing the 
entire 2016 season with injuries, 
sixth-year senior Tristian Perez-
Rivera made his long-awaited 
return to competition on the 
still rings with a score of 13.80. 
Redshirt junior Marty Strech 
performed well with strong holds 
and only a small misstep on his 
dismount to tie for fourth place on 

the event with a score of 14.20.

Five of the six Michigan 

gymnasts performed a Kasamatsu 
full on vault, with Krystek sticking 
his landing.

Cole stood in for the injured 

McCallum as the anchor on the 
vault and performed an excellent 
Yurchenko with two and a half 
twists to score 14.30 and win the 
event title.

“I had a little bit of a mental 

block going into vault … so today 
just felt great to break that and just 
represent Michigan,” Cole said. 
“We have this saying in the gym, 
we say ‘Be prepared, just be ready 
to handle anything.’ We weren’t 
going to let (McCallum’s injury) 
stop us from winning today.”

Eke stuck his double pike 

dismount on the parallel bars 
to cap off a skillful routine that 
scored 14.15, good for third on the 
event. Belanovski stuck his double 
pike as well, placing slightly lower 
than Eke with a score of 14.10.

Going into the final event, both 

teams were fired up and chanting 
along with the fans in what 
appeared to be a competition for 
which team and its fans could 
be louder. This fire was a great 
sign for the Wolverines, who lost 
energy toward the end of their 
loss against Oklahoma.

“We talked about it after the 

last week’s meet, and we talked 
about it just prior to the meet 
during lineup,” said Michigan 
coach Kurt Golder. “I think it was 
their focus.”

Coming off of a difficult 

competition on high bar against 
Oklahoma, the Wolverines were 
locked in. Krystek led off with 
a solid routine with no major 
errors. Bock recovered from his 
fall in the previous meet to put in 
a clean routine that ended with a 
nearly stuck dismount, earning 
Michigan’s highest score on the 
high bar and placing second 
overall on the event.

The meet came down to the 

final 
competitor. 
Belanovski’s 

stuck dismount and resulting 
score of 13.10 were met with 
celebration from his teammates 
and gave the Wolverines the 
411.850-410.650 victory over the 
Buckeyes.

Michigan fought hard for its 

first win of the season, making the 
celebration after the final routine 
that much more enjoyable. 

“I didn’t know (we had won), 

really, until after the meet was 
over.” Golder said. “I thought we 
had won, but they’re a very strong 
team, we just feel very fortunate 
that we got by them.”

Dmitri Belanovski and Michigan beat No. 6 Ohio State this weekend.

Three takeaways from Michigan’s win over Nebraska

On Friday, the No. 4 Michigan 

wrestling team triumphed over 
No. 15 Nebraska 24-10 in the type 
of scrappy, hard-fought meet that 
one can expect from an elite Big 
Ten matchup.

The bout featured five ranked 

matchups, a thrilling overtime 
finish and last minute takedowns, 
all contributing to the ethos of a 
hungry Wolverine team.

The name of the game this 

week for Michigan was avoiding a 
post-big-win slump. In a shocking 
upset last week, the Wolverines 
took down long-time Big Ten 
powerhouse Iowa in a meet that 
was decided by the final matchup.

They prevailed against top 

competition, but not without some 
minor scrapes and bruises along 
the way. The Daily assessed the 
wrestling team and reflected over 
the major takeaways from the 
meet.

Logan Massa is back
Redshirt 
sophomore 
Logan 

Massa returned from leg injury 
in a big way. He defeated the 
12th-ranked Isaiah White in an 
overtime classic.

After three periods, the score 

was tied, 1-1, with each wrestler 
getting away with only one escape. 
Then, the crowd rose to its feet to 
show support for the 165-pounder 
in the sudden-victory overtime 
round. White took a shot at Massa’s 
legs, a move he would instantly 
come to regret as Massa countered 
and delivered the match-sealing 
takedown.

“When it comes down to 

overtime, it’s whoever wants it 
more,” Massa said. “There’s not as 
much skill, not as much strategy 
and I knew that kid was gonna 
break after that last shot he took. I 
knew that was everything he had 
and I wasn’t gonna give up until I 
couldn’t walk off that mat.”

This 
win 
was 
especially 

meaningful for Massa, since he 
had lost his last four matches. 
Granted, the losses were all at the 
hands of top-10 ranked opponents, 
but a losing streak is not something 
that Massa is used to.

“I’ve been battling injury and I 

lost four matches in a row,” Massa 

said. “I can’t tell you the first time 
I lost four matches in a season, let 
alone a row, so mentally I wasn’t 
all there, so I’ve been in the room 
working my butt off for six hours 
a day.”

Now, Massa has left all his past 

losses behind him and is working 
to get healthy and foster the right 
mentality to secure victory.

“This win was awesome, those 

matches are the matches that I 
need,” Massa said. “Now, let’s 
say I’m 75 percent. When I get to 
100 percent in March, that’s only 
gonna get worse. All those losses 
that I had, I’m gonna reverse them 
come March. Those are gonna 
make me better and they’re only 
gonna make me train harder, so 
come March they better be ready 
because I’m comin’.”

Kevin 
Beazley’s 

inconsistencies

Last week, fifth-year senior 

Kevin Beazley stepped up and 
delivered 
a 
career-defining 

performance by upsetting then-
fifth ranked Cash Wilcke from 
Iowa. This week, Beazley seemed 
to have left his aggression in Iowa 
City. He fell to Erik Schultz, an 
opponent he handily defeated 
earlier in the season.

Beazley jumped to an early lead 

by securing a takedown in the 
first period. He then erroneously 

went on the defensive, desperately 
trying to cling to his lead.

It’s a strategy that plagues all 

athletes. The defense becomes 
complacent, only worrying about 
the big play. Then suddenly, an 
upset happens.

“He 
didn’t 
wrestle 
seven 

minutes,” said Michigan coach Joe 
McFarland. “He’s looking at the 
clock halfway through the match 
and you can’t do that. Kevin’s gotta 
wrestle a complete 
match, he wrestles 
a complete match, 
he beats that kid 
every time. That 
one, 
he 
wasn’t 

focused on the 
right stuff in those 
moments and you 
gotta 
focus 
on 

scoring the next 
point and getting 
the next position.”

In order to find consistent 

success this season and heed 
McFarland’s advice, Beazley must 
wrestle as if he’s down two to a 
higher-ranked 
opponent 
every 

time. When he does, success is 
imminent.

Latter five weight classes 

cement elite position

Four of the five Wolverine 

wrestlers in the heaviest five 
weight classes are ranked in the 

top 10. With that, other teams will 
have a difficult time traversing the 
second half of the program.

With Massa back in the lineup 

and rapidly approaching peak 
competing form, he, redshirt 
sophomore Myles Amine, redshirt 
senior 
Domenic 
Abounader, 

Beazley and fifth-year senior 
Adam Coon serve as Michigan’s 
iron wall.

Against Nebraska, they won 

four of their five 
matchups 
— 

two to ranked 
opponents. 
Unlike traditional 
matches, 
the 

latter five weight 
classes went out 
early. Abounader 
led off the meet 
for the first time 
in 
his 
career 

and 
did 
not 

disappoint.

Overall, these five consistently 

produce dominant performances 
that will be pivotal for the 
remainder of the dual season.

“We won a lot of the scrappy, 

hard-fought 
matches 
tonight,” 

McFarland said. “Those are always 
good to win. There were moments 
in those matches where some of 
those matches could’ve gone either 
way and our guys took control.”

Redshirt sophomore Logan Massa broke a four-match losing streak, defeating 12th-ranked Isaiah White.

‘M’ celebrates the past, 
present over weekend

The 
Michigan 
swimming 

and diving team — on both the 
men’s and the women’s side — 
has a long and rich tradition of 
training swimmers to compete 
not only as a Wolverine on the 
collegiate level, but also at the 
highest level in the world: the 
Olympics.

Eighty-seven swimmers have 

gone on to the Olympics from 
the University of Michigan from 
1900 to now. On Friday night at 
Canham Natatorium, former 
Olympians Peter Vanderkaay, 
Chris 
Thompson, 
Charlie 

Houchin, John Piersma, Sean 
Ryan, Melinda Harrison, Ginny 
Fuldner 
and 
Mike 
McWha 

returned to the pool where they 
swam as students and were 
recognized mid-meet for their 
exemplary accomplishments.

For Michigan coach Mike 

Bottom, it was a touching 
tribute to that inspired his 
swimmers. 

“It gives us an idea,” he 

said, “of where some of these 
student-athletes are gonna go.”

The 
most 

decorated 
Olympian 
in 

attendance was 
Vanderkaay, 
a 

2006 graduate. 
Vanderkaay 
won 
gold 

medals in the 
4x200-meter 
freestyle 
relay 

in both 2004 
and 
2008. 

He 
also 
won 

a bronze medal in the 200-
meter freestyle in 2008 and a 
bronze medal in the 400-meter 
freestyle in 2012.

“(Being back) brings back 

a 
lot 
of 
great 
memories,” 

Vanderkaay said, “I’d say most 
of them are from training. The 
bond with my teammates is 
what I remember the most … I 
talk to my classmates probably 
every day. We have a group 

chat.” 

Also honored Friday night 

was 
John 
Piersma, 
who 

competed as part of the United 
States Olympic team in Atlanta 
in 1996. Piersma, who attended 
Michigan from 1993-96, spoke 
with a fondness in his voice as 
he thought back to his time as a 
student. 

“The pool is the same, even 

coming back twenty years later 
it’s still a welcome place to 
come,” Piersma said. “… Great 
memories.”

As the seniors were also 

being honored that night, the 
past and the present were being 
celebrated together in a way 
that, of course, brought to light 
thoughts of the future for the 
swimmers competing in the 
pool that day.

“We always tell everybody 

that not everybody on the team 
is gonna make the Olympics, 
but everybody on the team is 
gonna help somebody make the 
Olympics,” Bottom said. “All of 
them can claim a little piece of 
that as a team.

“...You can bet that there 

are gonna be Olympians in 

Tokyo. 
We’re 

gonna have five 
or six of these 
individuals 
in 

the Olympics.”

It’s hard to 

ignore the clock 
counting 
down 

to 
the 
Tokyo 

Olympics 
as 

it 
stands 
on 

the wall of the 
natatorium. The 
Olympic 
rings 

are displayed on the wall on the 
other side of the block ‘M’ near 
the back of Canham. For many 
athletes that competed Friday, 
the Olympics are on their minds.

As 
the 
swimming 
and 

diving team made a point of 
celebrating the seniors leaving 
the program and the Olympians 
who left the program long ago, 
a sense of tradition was evident 
throughout the natatorium.

Wolverines haunted by missed opportunities, fall to Wisconsin, 4-2

The adage “three strikes and 

you’re out” may have originated 
with baseball, but it works fairly 
well in hockey too.

One minute into Saturday’s 

game, 
Michigan 
defenseman 

Sam Piazza motored around to 
the left circle, where his shot 
rebounded off of Kyle Hayton’s 
pads. The puck then bounced 
to a wide-open Cooper Marody 
with the Wisconsin goaltender 
nowhere near the play. Marody, 
a Hobey Baker Award nominee, 
normally puts away chances like 
those in his sleep. His attempt 
flew past Hayton — and the pipe.

Not 
long 
after 
Marody’s 

near-miss, senior forward Tony 
Calderone poked the puck away 
from a Badger near the blue line. 
The Wolverines’ leading scorer 
had a clean breakaway, but 
Hayton stonewalled him deep in 
the crease.

A third opportunity — while 

not quite as golden as the first 
two — came a minute later. 
On a three-vs-two, freshman 
forward Josh Norris laid the 
puck off to freshman forward 
Dakota 
Raabe, 

who 
cruised 

unchallenged 
into 
the 
slot. 

Again, 
Hayton 

made the save.

When 

Wisconsin 
forward 
Trent 

Frederic slipped 
the 
puck 
past 

Hayden Lavigne 
four 
minutes 

later, the tone was set. The 
Badgers made the most of their 
chances. The Wolverines didn’t. 
Thusly, Wisconsin (8-9-3 Big 
Ten, 14-13-4 overall) came away 
with a 4-2 win Saturday night 
at Yost Ice Arena, splitting a 
crucial Big Ten series between 

two teams neck-and-neck in the 
conference standings.

Despite 
winning 
5-3 
on 

Friday, Michigan (8-10-2, 13-13-

2) was seemingly 
outplayed 
for 

long 
stretches, 

especially 
during the third 
period. 
The 

opposite was the 
case 
Saturday. 

The Wolverines 
consistently 
controlled 
the 

puck and outshot 
the 
Badgers, 

34-33, including a high volume 
of grade-A opportunities.

“I thought we had a better 

effort tonight. I thought we 
played a better game,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“We 
created 
more 
offense 

tonight than we did last night. 

Had some golden opportunities, 
especially that first five, six 
minutes, we came out and were 
all over them played in their 
zone. ... We put one of those in, I 
think you see a totally different 
game tonight.”

Instead, 
Hayton, 
who 

replaced Friday night starter 
Jack Berry, was up to the task 
all night for Wisconsin. Brilliant 
with both his glove and his pads, 
the ECAC goalie of the year last 
season at St. Lawrence posted 32 
saves to keep the Wolverines at 
bay.

“We had all the opportunities 

in the world to make it a 5-4 
game for us and he stood on 
his head, made a few really 
good saves and hurt us,” said 
sophomore forward Jake Slaker. 
“But it comes down to us. It’s not 
really what (Hayton’s) doing, it’s 
what we’re doing.”

Michigan suffered some self-

inflicted wounds, too, but none 
hurt more than Wisconsin’s 
second goal, which came against 
the Wolverines’ shaky penalty 
kill. Thirteen minutes into the 
first period, Badger forward 
Ryan Wagner stretched out his 
stick and sent a slow roller into 
the crease that had no business 
finding the net. But junior 
defenseman 
Nicholas 
Boka 

couldn’t clear it, Lavigne didn’t 
see it in time, and the puck 
crawled past them both.

Just 56 seconds later, forward 

Cullen Brady lasered a wrist 
shot from the right circle past 
Lavigne. In the span of six 
minutes, the Badgers had taken 
a 3-0 lead.

Michigan went on the penalty 

kill early in the second period, 
again with disastrous results. 
Defenseman 
Wyatt 
Kalynuk 

scored on a rip from the blue 
line just five seconds after 
the initial face-off, prompting 
Pearson to insert sophomore 
Jack LaFontaine 
between 
the 

pipes in relief of 
Lavigne.

“I 
just 

wanted 
to 
get 

(LaFontaine) in 
the net,” Pearson 
said. 
“Just 
to 

get 
him 
some 

minutes and see 
how he was, and 
I thought he did 
an outstanding job. He gave us 
a chance to come back in this 
game.”

Michigan 
took 
advantage 

of that chance. Slaker found 
the net midway through the 
second with an angled shot off 
a pass by senior defenseman 

Sam Piazza. Eight minutes into 
the final stanza, Jack Becker 
lit the lamp on a power play to 
pull the Wolverines to within in 
striking distance. Meanwhile, 
LaFontaine stopped all 18 shots 
that were sent his way.

But it takes more than one 

strikeout to lose a baseball 
game, 
and 
the 
same 
logic 

applies 
to 
hockey 
as 
well. 

The three opportunities the 
Wolverines had early in the 
first period weren’t the only 
strikes they took — for them, 
missed opportunities defined 
the contest.

When Kalynuk went to the 

box early in the third period, 
the ensuing power-play proved 
to be a microcosm of all of the 
chances Michigan had to take 
control of the game. Freshman 
defenseman 
Quinn 
Hughes 

missed the net wide right. 
Calderone fanned on an open 
shot from the slot. Hayton 
extended an elastic reach to 
deny Slaker from straight on.

The misses kept coming up 

until the final horn. On a two-
on-one, Norris hit Slaker with a 
perfect pass, but his effort sailed 
high. 
After 
the 
Wolverines 

pulled 
LaFontaine 
in 

desperation 
mode in the final 
minute, 
junior 

defenseman 
Joseph Cecconi’s 
shot went wideby 
mere inches. And 
that was that.

“Frustrating,” 

Pearson 
said. 

“That’s the best 

word to describe this evening.”

Added Piazza: “I thought 

we had a really good start, we 
played well enough to win. Just 
really unfortunate we couldn’t 
put the puck in the net early, and 
they got a few crappy bounces. 
Just one of those nights.”

No. 13 Michigan’s offense listless in loss

Where 
has 
the 
Michigan 

women’s basketball teams offense 
gone?

The 13th-ranked Wolverines’ 

scoring touch was nowhere to 
be found in their 63-56 loss to 
Rutgers (6-5 Big Ten, 18-7 overall). 
Unfortunately for Michigan, this 
has been the case since the fourth 
quarter of its loss to Purdue on 
Thursday.

Entering Sunday’s game, the 

Wolverines 
(8-4, 
19-6) 
were 

ranked fifth in the Big Ten in 
scoring, averaging 77.1 points per 
game. The 56 point total was their 
third fewest of the season.

The struggles were apparent 

from the opening tip. Michigan 
scored just seven points in the 
first quarter while Rutgers played 
solid defense on the Wolverines’ 
all-time leading scorer, senior 
Katelynn Flaherty. The guard 
wasn’t able to find her rhythm, 
shooting just twice in the opening 
period and scoring zero points.

While Flaherty and Michigan 

were able to pick up their output in 
the second, the team still amassed 
just 14 points in the third quarter. 
The Wolverines were, however, 

able 
to 
execute 
defensively, 

holding the Scarlet Knights to 13 
points. Despite the ineffective 
play, Michigan was down just 
seven at the half.

The 
Wolverines’ 
biggest 

struggle was their inability to 
take care of the ball. Michigan 
committed 26 turnovers, well 
over its season average of 16.1. 
And Rutgers capitalized on their 
mistakes, scoring 26 points off 
the Wolverines’ turnovers. The 
biggest culprit was Michigan’s 
main ball handler — Flaherty — 
who committed a staggering 10 
turnovers.

“I think we turned it over 

trying to get out in transition,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico. 
“Watching them play Maryland 
(on Thursday), Maryland was 
really able to get out in transition 
and score some easy buckets that 
way. And (Rutgers) is a team that 
makes you play in the half court, 
and if they make you have to grind 
it out we thought that would be 
tough.”

“You can’t win a game with that 

many turnovers.”

The 
Wolverines 
did 
show 

glimpses of solid play in the 
second half, partially returning to 
form with 35 points. But it wasn’t 

enough. Michigan shouldn’t be 
too surprised, though, as the 
Scarlet Knights have the top-
ranked defense in the conference, 
allowing just 57.1 points per game.

The 
staunch 
defense 
and 

the hostile road environment 
undoubtedly took a toll on the 
Wolverines’ bench, which scored 
just four points. The first player off 
the bench, freshman guard Deja 
Church, was the only Michigan 
non-starter to score.

A positive takeaway for the 

Wolverines was their ability to 
shut down Rutgers best player, 
Tyler Scaife. Despite averaging 
19.2 points, the senior guard was 
held to just two field goals, totaling 
seven points. However, the Scarlet 
Knights found an unlikely hero 
in sophomore Ciani Cryor. The 
guard, who averages 6.6 points, 
had a career day with 16 points 
and four assists.

“I think every team goes 

through this,” Barnes Arico said. 
“It’s like, now you have to keep 
your confidence, now we have to 
get back to work (and) we have to 
get better. Let’s not lose our mind, 
I mean we’ve lost two games. The 
world is not coming to an end. 
Let’s regroup. Let’s figure out how 
to get better.”

Special teams play significant role in 
weekend split with No. 18 Wisconsin

Earlier in the week, Mel 

Pearson said he expected the 
series against No. 18 Wisconsin 
could get a little “chippy.”

With conference points at 

stake for both the Badgers and 
the 
20th-ranked 
Michigan 

hockey team this weekend, the 
presence 
of 
physicality 
and 

emotions was almost inevitable. 
What Pearson couldn’t have 
foreseen, 
though, 
was 
that 

Friday night’s game would have 
a penalty summary lengthy 
enough to look like a team roster.

The night witnessed a grand 

total of 48 penalty minutes 
— with 17 separate players 
receiving penalties — and 24 
of them were doled out during 
the first period of the game. 
The Wolverines accounted for 
just over half of these minutes, 
putting Wisconsin on the power 
play seven times in the game.

“Discipline was not good,” 

Pearson said. “You could see 
right at the start of the second 
period after we got the lead that 
(Wisconsin) was going to come 
out and play physical and try to 
get us off our game a little bit, 
and they did a good job. And we 
fell right into it, and took some 
penalties in the second and the 
third and that gave them some 
momentum and some life. And 
that’s what they wanted to do.”

Added sophomore forward 

Jake Slaker: “We took way too 
many penalties and I think it’s 
unacceptable on our part.”

And 
though 
Michigan 

gave the Badgers many man-
advantage opportunities that 
played a part in their third 
period resurgence, when they 
rallied for two more goals, the 
Wolverines largely stood their 
ground on the penalty kill. 
Wisconsin converted on just 
one of its seven special teams 
showings.

On 
the 
other 
side 
of 

Michigan’s special teams, there 
was a stark contrast from last 
weekend’s lifeless power plays in 
Ohio State and the general trend 
of this season. The Wolverines 
lit the lamp twice, constituting 
just under half of the goals in 
Michigan’s 5-3 win.

The first time came just over 

halfway into the first period, 
when junior defenseman Joseph 
Cecconi took the puck into the 
Badgers’ zone and slapped a 
strong shot into the top-left 
shelf. Then, on another power 
play with under three minutes 
remaining in the same period, 
Slaker — set up perfectly outside 
of the crease — knocked the puck 
in. 

“The power play is just a huge 

momentum swing, and when 
we’re not scoring it’s tough,” 
Slaker said. “… You know it 
hasn’t been our strongest aspect 
of the game, but it showed up 
big for us tonight. And it shows 

we’re working hard in practice 
and sticking to details for that.”

The next night, though not 

nearly as physical as Friday and 
with less than half the penalty 
minutes, the ability to perform 
on both sides of special teams 
again proved crucial.

But 
Saturday 
night, 
the 

Wolverines’ 
penalty 
kill 
— 

which sits second to last in the 
conference with an effectiveness 
of 75.90 percent — wasn’t as 
resilient as it had been just a day 
earlier.

With 
five 
man-advantages 

during the game, Wisconsin 
found the net on two of them, all 
before Michigan put anything 
on the scoreboard to show for its 
efforts.

On 
the 
Wolverines’ 
first 

penalty of the game, the Badgers 
were able to convert and bring 
their lead to two. Then, just 
over three minutes into the 
second period, when sophomore 
forward James Sanchez was 
called 
for 
unsportsmanlike 

conduct, Wisconsin defenseman 
Wyatt Kalynuk sent the puck 
past 
sophomore 
goaltender 

Hayden Lavigne just seconds 
into the penalty. This was 
enough to bench Lavigne for the 
remainder of the game, as the 
netminder allowed four goals off 
16 shots.

The night before told a very 

different story for Lavigne. The 
goaltender largely bailed his 
team out Friday, as the Badgers 
fired double the amount of shots, 
forcing Lavigne to make 37 saves 
in the showing.

Pearson noted Lavigne has 

seen better nights, but attributed 
the Wolverines’ early deficit to 
poor timing with penalties. And 
Michigan never recovered.

“We were (more disciplined), 

but still, a couple bad penalties,” 
Pearson said. “… It happened at 
bad times too, when we were 
trying to get back in the game. 
And we would take a penalty, 
and lose all of that momentum. 
So we have to understand how to 
manage the game better in those 
situations.”
