‘U’ confirms safety of 
14 students, faculty 
and staff in France

By LARA MOEHLMAN 

Daily Staff Reporter

With Paris still reeling after 

a series of terrorist attacks hit 
the city Friday night, about 80 

students gathered on the Diag 
Saturday evening to light candles 
in a show of solidarity with the 
people of France.

According 
to 
French 

authorities, at least 129 people 
were killed in shootings at a 
Paris concert hall and on city 
streets, as well as explosions 
near the entryways of the Stade 
de France soccer stadium. The 
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, 

better known as ISIS, claimed 
responsibility for the attacks.

Saturday’s vigil was organized 

by several students from France 
currently studying abroad at 
the University. They reached 
out to community members 
through social media to support 
those grieving civilian lives lost 
in their country. Students lit 
memorial candles and stood for a 
moment of silence before singing 

the French national anthem.

In a speech to attendees, 

LSA senior Bertrand de La 
Ronciere, a French international 
exchange student, highlighted 
his fear that the recent attacks 
would exacerbate racist and 
Islamophobic tensions he said 
are already present in Europe.

2015 freshman class 

reflects efforts to 
defer, waitlist more 

applicants

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

At a Board of Regents meeting 

last 
fall, 
University 
Provost 

Martha 
Pollack 
expressed 

frustration with the University’s 
trend of enrolling too many 
students.

“We have been over-enrolling 

every year for the past five years 
and we have to stop this,” Pollack 
said at the time. “I’m not happy 
about it.”

Pollack called for a plan to curb 

over-enrollment, and according 
to enrollment figures released 
last month for the 2015 freshman 
class, those plans worked.

The 
report 
revealed 
the 

University 
enrolled 
6,071 

students in this year’s freshman 

class, down considerably from the 
6,505 freshmen enrolled in fall 
2014. Here’s how the University 
did it.

A growing problem

Last 
year 
the 
University 

enrolled 6,532 freshman, an 
increase of 307 students from 
the previous year, and more 
than 500 students more than 
the institution was planning to 
enroll.

To accommodate the larger 

class size, LSA added 41 new class 
sections for the fall semester 
and 45 additional class sections 
for the winter semester, and the 
College of Engineering hired new 
instructors to teach additional 
discussion sections for first-year 
courses.

Administrators also had to 

manage 
a 
housing 
shortage, 

which was a result of both over-
enrollment and the closure of 
West Quadrangle for renovation. 
To ensure incoming freshman 
could live in on-campus residence 
halls, the University provided

FOOTBALL

Wolverines 

survive double-
overtime scare in 

Bloomington

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

BLOOMINGTON — When the 

last of the 80 passes attempted 
in the Michigan football team’s 
game at Indiana hit the ground, 
the entire travel roster sprinted 
into the end zone where Delano 
Hill made the game-clinching 
play. Jim Harbaugh pumped his 
fists and ran to greet Indiana 
coach Kevin Wilson, and the rest 
of the Wolverines jumped on top 
of one another, whooping and 
hollering.

Three of Michigan’s last four 

games have ended in similar 
fashion.

First there was the heartbreak 

of Oct. 17 in Michigan Stadium, 
when 
Jalen 
Watts-Jackson 

returned Blake O’Neill’s fumble 
into the end zone and the rest of 
his Michigan State teammates 

piled on top of him. Then, two 
weeks later, there was the goal-
line stand at Minnesota, when 
the Wolverines throttled the 
Golden Gophers in the game’s 
final second. Then, it was their 
turn to sprint onto the field and 
celebrate. They claimed the Little 
Brown Jug trophy as their own.

Saturday night’s game was 

another exercise in dramatic 
finishes. 
Michigan’s 
48-41 

double-overtime conquest was 
the result of timely plays and a 
whole lot of spunk from fifth-year 
senior quarterback Jake Rudock.

Rudock, often maligned at 

the beginning of the season 
for turnovers, threw for six 
touchdowns and 440 yards. He 
scampered for 64 yards, too, and 
took hard hit after hard hit. He 
even threw an interception in the 
third quarter. It seemed costly at 
the time, when the Wolverines 
trailed by two. By the end of the 
game, it was irrelevant. No other 
quarterback in program history 
has thrown six touchdowns in a 
single game.

“He is unflappable,” Harbaugh 

said. “He just does not flinch.”

Flowdom, a student dance organization, performs at Celebrasia in the East Hall Math Atrium on Saturday. 
Celebrasia was hosted by the Chinese Students Association to celebrate the diversity of Asian culture on campus. 

Annual festival 
celebrates broad 
array of Asian 

cultures 

By RACHEL COHEN

For the Daily

As the name suggests, the 

Chinese Students Association’s 
Celebrasia event is designed 
to celebrate Asian culture, 
particularly through traditional 

food and performance art. 
However, 
Celebrasia 
is 
no 

melting pot. Saturday’s event 
aimed to honor the unique 
attributes 
of 
individual 

cultures, as well as recognize 
the connections between them.

“Celebrasia is the coming 

together of many different 
organizations to celebrate their 
different cultures and show that 
we’re not just a mass of Asians,” 
said Business senior Drew Siew, 
the CSA president. “There’s 
intricacies 
and 
differences 

between each Asian Culture.”

Held in East Hall’s Math 

Atrium, this year’s Celebrasia 
showcased 10 performances 
and featured 18 tables from 
various student organizations.

The event’s theme, “The 

Four Nations Festival,” played 
on the four elemental nations 
represented in “Avatar: The 
Last Airbender,” a cartoon that 
drew much of its inspiration 
from Asian culture. The Math 
Atrium was decorated with 
symbols of the four nations 
— which are earth, water, fire

FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THIS WEEK (NOV. 16, 2000)

Affirmative action suits filed

CE LE BR A SIA

In 1997, two students 

filed a lawsuit against the 
University challenging the 
use of race as a factor in 
admissions decisions.

The case, brought for-

ward by the Center for Indi-
vidual Rights on the behalf 
of Patrick Hamacher and 
Jennifer Gratz, was heard 
15 years ago this week by 
Judge Patrick Duggan. 

Hamacher 
and 
Gratz 

were two white applicants 
to LSA who argued the use 
of race as a factor in Univer-
sity admissions resulted in 
their rejections.

Both the University and 

the Center of Individual 
Rights hoped Judge Dug-

gan submitted motions for a 
summary judgment, mean-
ing the case would not go 
to trial. A summary judg-
ment would have ended the 
case at the district level. 
The Center for Individual 
Rights argued that the 14th 
Amendment of the Consti-
tution, which calls for equal 
protection under the law, 
prohibits race from being 
a factor in admission poli-
cies. The University, on the 
other hand, employed the 
1978 Supreme Court case of 
Regents of the University of 
California v. Bakke to justi-
fy the use of race in applica-
tions as long as the policies 
did not employ quotas.

The 
case 
eventually 

made its way to the U.S. 
Supreme Court, along with 
another case challenging 
the University Law School’s 
use of affirmative action. 
The 
court 
ruled 
LSA’s 

policy that employed a 
point-based system uncon-
stitutional, but upheld the 
law school’s consideration 
of race as one of many fac-
tors while using a holistic 
approach to evaluate can-
didates.

In 2006, Michigan voters 

enacted a ban on the use of 
affirmative action in admis-
sions.

University research 
shows adolescent 
stress carries into 
young adulthood

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

The harmful effects of anxiety 

experienced during adolescence 
may carry into young adulthood.

That’s according to a recent 

study from University research-
ers that followed 176 Black youth 
from Flint, Mich. over seven 
years — from 1994 to 2001 — and 
showed anxiety from the their 
adolescent years affected their 
stress hormone levels in young 
adulthood. Previous studies have 
shown similar trends, but not spe-
cifically in Black populations.

The researchers looked at levels 

of cortisol, a hormone produced 
by the body during times of stress, 

that raises the level of sugar in the 
bloodstream. The brain can then 
use the extra sugar as energy for 
helping think through the stress-
ful situation.

Cortisol helps in dealing with 

acute, short-term stress. How-
ever, anxiety causes prolonged 
production of cortisol, which is 
detrimental for the body. Chronic 
cortisol production is associated 
with numerous diseases and con-
ditions, including cardiovascular 
diseases, obesity, diabetes, anxiety, 
depression and sleep disorders.

The study, published earlier 

this month in International Jour-
nal of Endocrinology and Metabo-
lism, is not the first to look at how 
anxiety in adolescence affects 
cortisol levels in adulthood, but it 
is the first to do so in Black youths. 
Most previous studies looked at 
middle-class white populations. 

Shervin Assari, a Psychiatry 

research faculty member and 
head of the research team, said he 

looked specifically at young Black 
individuals from Flint because of 
the problems many face due to 
low-income backgrounds and rac-
ism.

“For Black youths, some life 

challenges include living in an 
unsafe environment, discrimina-
tion at interpersonal level and rac-
ism in a structural level,” Assari 
wrote in an e-mail to The Michi-
gan Daily.

Assari defined “structural rac-

ism” as societal barriers for a pop-
ulation’s access to resources, such 
as education and employment 
opportunities.

The study analyzed male and 

female participants separately, as 
gender is known to shape what 
kind of stress people experience.

“Men and women have very 

different life experiences and 
exposures that make them differ-
ently vulnerable or resilient to the 
effect of risk and protective fac-
tors,” Assari wrote.

The team saw an overproduc-

tion of cortisol in females if they 
had anxiety symptoms in their 
adolescent years, but not nec-
essarily in males. In males, the 
overproduction was instead asso-
ciated with alcohol use in adoles-
cent years.

Psychology Prof. Marc Zim-

merman said one of the caveats 
for this study was that the team 
looked at young adulthood — or 
early 20s — which may not be able 
to be considered complete adult-
hood because the brain is still 
developing.

“It can be argued that is not 

yet complete adulthood,” he said. 
“Some researchers suggest that 
the brain doesn’t fully develop 
until the age of 25.” Still, Zim-
merman said the study still has 
important implications.

“(The stresses) create prob-

lems in terms of our physical and 
mental health,” he said. “They 
are persistent. They are not just 
ephemeral. Our job as adults is to 
create safe and healthy environ-
ments as much as we can … to help 
our society as a whole.”

Event aims to foster 
collaboration among 
student orgs focused 

on mental health

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

On Saturday, student organiza-

tions dedicated to mental health 
came together to create a uniform 
approach to addressing these 
issues at the University.

Central Student Government 

paired with Counseling and Psy-
chological Services to host the 
University’s first mental health 
summit. The outlined goal for the 
summit was to inspire coopera-
tion between the leaders of differ-
ent student organizations focusing 
on mental health across campus. 
About 10 of these organizations 
were represented at the meeting.

CAPS director Todd Sevig 

said important progress has been 
made toward improving the men-
tal health climate on campus in 
the last couple of years, and this 
change has been, in part, spear-
headed by student organizations 
pushing for the expansion of Uni-

versity resources for wellness. CSG 
President Cooper Charlton, an LSA 
senior, said these efforts could ben-
efit from being more collaborative.

“I think we all are doing a lot of 

phenomenal things on campus, but 
often times we’re very busy and 
aren’t on the same page,” Charlton 
said. “This is kind of a flag in the 
ground to bring a lot of strong lead-
ers together around mental health 
and understand what everyone 
else’s vision and goals are, and find 
ways that we can empower each 
other.”

Participants sat at round tables 

with a CSG and CAPS member 
present to interact with students 
and faculty members at each of the 
roughly 10 tables. The CSG mem-
ber facilitated the talks, during 
which student organization rep-
resentatives shared the vision and 
goals of their respective clubs.

LSA freshman Shelby Stever-

son, a member of CAPS in Action, 
a new club created to promote 
CAPS over social media, said she 
enjoyed the discussions she had at 
the event.

“I really love hearing every-

one else’s ideas for how we can 
improve mental health on campus 
and how we can reduce that stigma 
and show people that you can get 

help no matter what is going on,” 
Steverson said.

The CSG facilitator posed ques-

tions on topics such as funding 
needs, their organization’s current 
initiatives the organizations and 
each participant’s individual goals 
for the summit.

Information 
senior 
Sonia 

Doshi, president of the Healthy 
Minds Coalition, said she feels 
the increasing number of mental 
health organizations on campus 
has caused a “diffusion of advo-
cacy” among groups.

“I’m interested in figuring out 

ways that we can share ideas and 
get together more often so that we 
know what’s going on on campus 
and then create a bigger impact,” 
Doshi said.

After sharing the various goals 

and plans of the organizations 
present, each table brainstormed 
ways their clubs could work 
together to make a tangible impact.

Sevig said he came up with 

the idea to host the summit two 
years ago after various groups 
organizing around mental health 
expressed interest in creating a 
collaborative effort to change the 
stigma surrounding mental health 
on campus.

Cortisol overproduction 
linked to youth anxiety


returning students incentives to 
live off campus.

From 2009 to 2014, the 

University’s 
freshman 

enrollment remained well over 
6,000 students. Part of the 
initial uptick in applications was 
attributed to the University’s 
2010 decision to join the Common 
App, an online undergraduate 
college application which allows 
students to apply to any of the 622 
member schools.

Within the University’s first 

year as a Common App member, 
undergraduate 
applications 

to the institution rose by 25 
percent. Ted Spencer, associate 
vice 
provost 
and 
executive 

director 
of 
undergraduate 

admissions at the time, said 
though the University received 
more applications than ever 
during that first year, its yield 
was the lowest since 2006. Yield 
refers to the number of admitted 
students who actually end up 
enrolling at the University.

Spencer said because students 

submitting the Common App can 
apply to an increased number of 
schools with greater ease, it can 
be difficult to calculate yield.

“We admitted a slightly larger 

class this year … because we 
weren’t certain whether a lot of 
the students who did apply and 
had a strong resume would yield 
at the same rate,” he said.

National trends

The 
University’s 
recent 

issues 
with 
over-enrollment, 

however, defied national trends. 
According to the United States 
Census Bureau, from 2011 to 
2013, 
undergraduate 
college 

enrollment decreased by 930,000 
students, the largest drop since 
the bureau began collecting 
college enrollment data in 1966.

Michigan State University, 

which aims to enroll a total of 
50,000 undergraduate, graduate 
and 
professional 
students, 

has not struggled in recent 
years to enroll a target class 
size. Since peaking at 10,132 
undergraduates in 2012, the 
university’s 
freshman 
class 

has fluctuated close to 9,500 
students over the past few years.

There are notable differences 

between the way the two schools 
approach admissions. For one, 
Michigan State is not a member 
of the Common App.

John 
Gaboury, 
Michigan 

State’s 
associate 
provost 

for 
academic 
services 
and 

enrollment management, said 
not accepting the Common App 
makes it easier to estimate yield 
rates.

“We’re not on the Common 

App, and last year we had over 
35,000 applications,” Gaboury 
said. 
“In 
our 
calculations, 

people are specifically selecting 
Michigan State. So we know in 
our probabilities it isn’t just ‘Oh I 
could send this out to 20 schools 
and see what happens,’ so it 
makes a difference when you’re 
running your probability models 
and affects your yield rate.”

In 
addition, 
Michigan 

State enrolls far more in-state 
students. 
Gaboury 
said 
the 

school aims for in-state students 
to make up 70 percent of its total 
enrolled class, while Fall 2015 
enrollment reports show that 
approximately 57 percent of 
the University’s student body is 
comprised of in-state students.

Gaboury 
anticipates 

Michigan State will uphold 
current enrollment practices in 
the years to come.

“We’re going to stick with 

a similar strategy,” he said, 
noting the school’s success in 
enrolling a diverse student body. 
“We have the largest number of 
African-American students in 
our freshman class of any of the 
Big Ten institutions. We’re about 
653 for this year.”

Enrollment management

To combat over-enrollment 

at the University, the regents 
appointed 
Kedra 
Ishop, 
a 

longtime admissions official at 
the University of Texas at Austin, 
as the University’s first associate 
vice president for enrollment 
management. Ishop assumed the 
position at the beginning of the 
2014-2015 academic year.

Ishop said her first task was 

to determine a target number for 
the fall 2015 freshman class.

“It 
wasn’t 
necessarily 
a 

question of going up or down, 
it was let’s establish a target as 

a ceiling, as opposed to a floor,” 
Ishop said. “And there’s different 
approaches when your target is 
a ceiling and you don’t go over 
it, and your target is a floor and 
you don’t go under it. The floor 
generally has more to do with 
budget, since your institution 
is funded on your number of 
students. So being tasked to 
bring the class in on target and 
determining what that target 
was, and at the time it was just 
under 6,000.”

After establishing a target, 

Ishop said she began to evaluate 
how the University was releasing 
its decisions. Those applying for 
undergraduate admission to the 
University can apply either early 
action or regular decision. Early 
action applications are due Nov. 
1 and decisions are released at 
some point before Dec. 24, while 
regular decision applications 
are due Feb. 1 and decisions are 
released in early April.

Ishop 
said 
students 
who 

are admitted from the early 
action pool tend to enroll at the 
University. Therefore, to manage 
enrollment more effectively, the 
admissions office deferred more 
students from early action to 
regular decision than in years 
past.

“Early action here typically 

results in an enrollment, so 
we knew that if we released 
more then we’d have more 
enrollments, 
which 
means 

we’d have fewer spaces to offer 
during the regular term,” she 
said. “That was a mechanism 
to control the size of the class, 
essentially not to over-promise 
on the front end.”

Another 
mechanism 
the 

University used to control the 
enrollment was to put more 
students on the waitlist. In 
recent 
years, 
due 
to 
over-

enrollment, students on the 
waitlist have not been offered 

admission to the University. 
Despite 
offering 
admission 

to 2,000 fewer students in 
2015 than the previous year, 
a 2-percent increase in yield 
meant the University once again 
did not pull students from the 
waitlist.

From 
2014 
to 
2015, 
the 

University’s 
admittance 
rate 

dropped from 32.2 percent to 
26.2 percent, a trend Ishop 
expects to continue.

“As the application numbers 

continue to grow, regardless 
what we do with class size, we’re 
not going to keep up class size 
with the pace of growth in the 
applicant pool,” she said. “It’s also 
important to note that class size is 
a yearly determination, so making 
the decision for the class that 
it was last year was contingent 
upon what we had seen in the 
year past and how we wanted to 
stage ourselves for thinking about 
admissions and our targets, not on 
an annual basis but collectively 
where are we as an institution in 
terms of capacity and what does 
that need to look like in terms of 
our capacity.”

Ishop also said it is unlikely 

that the number of applications 
the University receives will 
decline any time soon. She 
said this trend is not tied to 
the Common App, and instead 
pointed to decreasing admit 
rates across the country.

“I 
won’t 
attribute 
it 

necessarily to Common App,” 
she said. “I will attribute it to, 
because admit rates are going 
down, students are hedging 
their bets. It’s our responsibility, 
when we’re recruiting, we try to 
be very transparent about that 
process and about that likelihood. 
We also have additional aspects 
of our application, so the student 
has to go a few extra steps to 
apply here. And what they talk 
about in their essays matters.”

The theme played a large 

role in displaying the intricacies 
of Asian culture. In the past, 
Celebrasia themes have received 
criticism for not relating to Asian 
culture, so this year, Engineering 
sophomore Eric Chan, a CSA 
representative, says the group 
aimed to change that.

“This is a pretty bold event,” 

he said. “Last year I know we 
did Harry Potter, and the year 
before we did something with 
pirates, but this year no one 
really expected ‘Avatar: The Last 
Airbender.’ ”

All 
18 
participating 

organizations had their own 
tables, which were decorated to 
feature the Avatar theme as well 
as the culture represented by the 

organization. Groups present 
included the Filipino American 
Student 
Association, 
the 

Taiwanese American Student 
Association, 
the 
Vietnamese 

Student Association and the 
Japanese Student Association. 
At the tables, event attendees 
could sample food from the 
organizations’ cultures.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Vishal 
Subrahmanyam 

said he came in part to see 
performances from his friends.

“I thought it would be a 

really 
enriching 
experience 

to come out here and taste 
the food and see what all of 
these organizations are about,” 
Subrahmanyam said.

The 
song 
and 
dance 

performances 
included 

traditional 
and 
modern 

arrangements, 
and 
some 

that mixed elements of both. 
Some 
groups 
focused 
on 

entertainment 
while 
others 

had 
educational 
aspects 
in 

their 
performances. 
The 

Filipino 
American 
Student 

Association performed a tribal 
dance from the T’boli Tribe 
that traditionally celebrates a 
good harvest. The performance 
strayed from the stereotypical 
Filipino dance.

LSA 
junior 
Tiffany 
Lao, 

performance chair for FASA, 
said people often think Filipino 
dances are always light and 
happy, but that is not necessarily 
true.

“Usually there’s a lot of 

cutesy 
really 
smiley 
happy 

dances but there’s also more 
serious dances,” Lao said. “It’s a 
really multifaceted culture and 
we try to embrace all of it.”

In conjunction with the new 

emphasis on a more culturally 
relevant 
theme, 
the 
CSA 

organizers wanted to stress the 
full richness of Asian culture. In 
past years, Celebrasia has only 

hosted East Asian countries. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Christy 

Leung, the event’s co-chair, 
said they tried to invite groups 
representing 
more 
diverse 

countries this year.

“We invited SAAN — South 

Asian 
Awareness 
Network 

— and the Pakistani Student 
Association,” Leung said. “We 
really tried to branch out and 
add more diversity to our lineup 
this year.”

LSA junior Pareesa Memon, 

president 
of 
the 
Pakistani 

Student 
Association, 
was 

surprised by the invitation to 
participate in the event because 
the Asian community and South 
Asian community are usually 
separated.

“We just want to show that 

Pakistan is part of Asia and give 
it more of a presence in that 
realm because it usually isn’t 
recognized as such,” Memon 
said.

Levine’s 
mother, 
Julie 

Buckner, 
the 
president 
and 

founder of the Josh E. Levine 
Foundation and a University 
alum, began the 5K with an 
emotional speech about her 
son, noting that the day marked 
exactly 69 weeks since his 
passing.

“We’re all here today because 

we 
want 
to 
prevent 
more 

tragedies,” Buckner said. “We 
all know, here on a college 
campus, that there are so many 
episodes every single night, and 
particularly on weekends, that 
are so preventable, and that’s 
what we’re here to do.”

Ultimately, she said, she’d like 

to see the binge-drinking culture 
shift on college campuses.

“I just want us to look out 

for each other more, to be 
more educated, to be more 
knowledgeable, to be more of a 
united community in preventing 
tragedies, and this is what we’re 
going for,” she said.

Sunday’s 
event 
was 
a 

culmination of the joint effort 
of LSA junior Hailey Olds, vice 
president of campus relations for 
AGD, and LSA junior Caroline 
Alford, vice president of the 
Panhellenic Association for DG. 
The two Greek organizations 
partnered this semester as part 
of the Panhellenic Association’s 
new “sister sorority” initiative, 
which pairs two sororities on 
campus in an effort to get to 
know each other better.

“We picked a theme of alcohol 

and drug awareness,” Alford 
said. “Obviously, the Josh E. 

Levine Foundation has quite 
a presence on campus, so we 
thought it would be meaningful.”

The two contacted Levine’s 

fraternity, 
Theta 
Chi, 
and 

member 
Brett 
Karpinos, 
an 

Engineering junior, stepped up 
to help them plan it.

“My older brother was one of 

Josh’s good friends, so I was like 
all right, I’ll do it,” Karpinos said. 
“Josh was a senior when I was a 
freshman, so I got to know him 
pretty well.”

This year, University officials 

have rolled out several new 
initiatives to curb dangerous 
alcohol consumption on campus, 
including an policy to notify the 
parents of first-year students 
who rack up multiple alcohol 
or drug violations, and a push 
for increased Division of Public 
Safety and Security engagement 
off campus.

Kinesiology junior Kenneth 

Taras, former president of Theta 
Chi, ran to support Buckner in 
her efforts.

“A lot of us in Theta Chi, all 

of us are really passionate about 
this,” Taras said.

Buckner expressed said she 

was humbled by the outpouring 
of support at the event.

“I think it’s great that Greek 

organizations are leading this 
today, and I hope that there will 
be more events on this issue 
that are led by Greek life in the 
future,” Buckner said.

Alford said the sororities hope 

to host the 5K again next year.

“There’s hope to make this 

sort of a sustainable thing in 
the future going forward, sort 
of an annual thing between our 
chapters,” she said.

During the vigil, de La

integration 
of 
immigrant 

communities, 
particularly 

the 
thousands 
of

who have been fleeing Syria 
in recent months for safety in 
Europe and elsewhere.

“This

yesterday, they didn’t bring it,” 
he said. “They did not want it. 
They did not approve it. On the 
contrary, this that happened 
yesterday is what they were 
fleeing from.”

Even so, de La Ronciere 

said Saturday’s Diag gathering 
made him optimistic.

“It’s a big message of hope to 

see that so many people are so 
full of solidarity,” he said.

Engineering

Julia 

Habif, who has many relatives in 
France, said she felt comforted 
by 
the 
demonstration 
of 

support from students who 
may not be as closely connected 

to the country. Habif’s family is 
Muslim, and she echoed de La 
Ronciere’s belief that she hopes 
Friday’s attacks do not increase 
racism toward Muslims.

“I see the racism,” she said. 

“I see the split. I think that the 
more hatred there is, the more 
division and the more people 
feel isolated.”

LSA 
senior 
Roxane 

Chambaug, an exchange student 
from southern France, said the 
event provided her with a sense 
of unity at a time when she felt 
very distant from her home.

“To me it’s about France, 

but not only about France,” she 
said. “It’s about all the lives 
that are being killed without 
any purpose. Of course I’m 
very moved … it happened in 
my country and it could have 
happened in my city.”

Nursing junior Matt White 

joined in mourning the victims 
of the Paris attacks, though he 
has no direct connections to 
France.

“I felt like I had to come to 

show my respects and show that 
I care,” he said.

White said the University 

community’s 
demonstration 

of solidarity was important 
not only in showing support 

for those affected, but also in 
helping 
University 
students 

reflect on the tragic events. 

“It shows that we care and 

that even though this happened 
halfway across the world, we 
stand with them,” he said. “And 
it also helps us process what 
happened.”

On Saturday morning, the 

University confirmed that all 14 
University-affiliated 
students, 

faculty and staff registered as 
having traveled to France are 
accounted for.

LSA freshman Maya Bishop 

said she also saw the vigil as a 
protest against the divides acts 
of terrorism attempt to create.

“What happened was an 

affront not just to France, 
but 
to 
all 
civilized 
and 

modern countries that have 
these 
values,” 
Bishop 
said. 

“(Terrorism) is trying to break 
people apart and make them 
scared, and this is the only way 
to combat that.”

LSA junior Theresa Witt, a 

foreign exchange student from 
Germany, said the attacks in 
Paris hit close to home for her 
because of the the city’s close 
proximity to her hometown.

However, 
she 
said, 
the 

attacks also remind her of other 

global tragedies that do not 
seem to receive as much media 
attention. She referenced the 
bombings in Beirut two days ago 
and the continuing violence in 
Syria, which she said the media 
has largely ignored compared to 
its coverage of the Paris attacks. 

“I very strongly think about 

all the people in Beirut today, 
about Syria, where it happens 
daily,” she said. “I feel with all 
the people there.”

Alone or on my own?

I 

strongly 
dislike 
labels. 
In 

high school, my mother once 
offhandedly remarked that I 

was an introvert, 
prompting 
a 

lot of negative 
feelings 
on 

my 
part. 
An 

introvert 
is 

someone 
who 

gets his or her 
energy 
from 

being 
alone, 

something I saw 
as 
distinctly 

negative.

While I spent 

a lot of time by 
myself in high school, I was appalled 
that anyone would believe I was 
spending my Friday nights at home 
to “recharge my batteries.” My alone 
time in high school arose not from 
a desire for “me time,” but from a 
lack of connection with the people 
planning the fun nights out. I resolved 
to disprove my mother’s comment by 
seeking out as many social connections 
as possible in college.

In hindsight, this determination to 

prove my extroversion was laughable. 
It turns out that when given a choice, I 
really do love being on my own.

Freshman year, I was so worried 

about being lonely at such a large 
university that I clung to the people 
I met. While we initially shared the 
common factor of being first-year 
students trying to navigate a new 
experience, it soon became painfully 
obvious that we shared little in the 
way of values, goals or personalities.

With no emotional connection 

to speak of, I began to feel extreme 
loneliness 
despite 
constantly 

surrounding myself with friends. 
Nevertheless, I held onto these tenuous 
connections because I was terrified of 
what might happen if I were to let go. 
What if there was no one at Michigan 

with whom I could genuinely connect? 
Would I go back to being the girl who 
spent her Friday nights alone?

The thought of being alone worried 

me so much that I began to develop a 
fear of abandonment. I overanalyzed 
every text I received, convinced that 
each person was planning to walk out 
of my life. FOMO — or fear of missing 
out — became another huge concern 
of mine, and soon every picture from 
every close friend posted to Facebook 
without my presence seemed to 
confirm that the worst had happened.

I voiced my constant anxiety 

until my fears became a self-
fulfilling prophecy for my life: 
The more I mulled over my 
abandonment conspiracy theories, 
the more I dragged down the group 
dynamic and the less my friends 
wanted to spend 
time with me. 

This year, I 

finally 
decided 

to conquer my 
insecurities 
by 
seeking 

opportunities 
to do things on 
my own. Rather 
than 
plan 
my 

days 
around 

friends’ busy schedules so that I 
wouldn’t have to eat or study alone, I 
began to plan my days around what 
I wanted to accomplish. Despite 
having 
fewer 
guaranteed 
social 

connections throughout my week, 
I’m now the happiest I have been in 
three years. With no one to please, 
answer to or worry about but myself, 
I’m finding the courage to become 
the person I always wanted to be. I’m 
rediscovering my passions for singing 
and writing, both of which I gave up as 
a freshman because none of my friends 
shared these interests. I’m gaining 
a better sense of self, purpose and 
lifelong aspirations. My worries about 

loneliness have subsided.

For me, the key to being on my 

own without feeling lonely has been 
embracing the communities I’m 
part of. My biggest social support 
system to date has come from fellow 
Residence Staff members in my 
building. Rather than cling to each 
staff member, I treat everyone like I 
would a cherished family member. 
They aren’t necessarily my best 
friends, but they are the people I 
come home to at the end of the day, 
eager to ask how I’m doing. They 
are the people who cheer me on, let 
me know that I matter and remind 
me that I am loved. Their constant 
support gives me the self-assurance 
to spend a few hours of the day on 
my own without ever feeling alone.

These days, I fully embrace the 

Friday 
nights 

I get to spend 
by myself. Who 
wouldn’t 
want 

to curl up in bed 
and watch Netflix 
after a long week 
of studying and 
interacting with 
residents? 
My 

attitude 
has 

changed 
since 

high school, because this time I have a 
choice as to how I spend my weekends. 
If I want to be social on a Friday night, 
I can sit in my hall’s lounge, mass-text 
my staff or walk to my community 
center. If I want to recharge my 
batteries and be by myself, there’s no 
shame in that either.

Though the label of “introvert” still 

irks me due to its oversimplification of 
the human experience, I can now say 
that when given a choice, I proudly, 
confidently and unabashedly love 
being on my own.

HUMPHREY

The weight of my Catholic education

NATALIE ZAK | VIEWPOINT

I am the product of 14 years of 

Catholic education. From pre-K 
to my senior year of high school, 
I took required religion classes 
that ranged from Rebuttal of the 
Big Bang to Commitment or Die 
Alone, attended monthly school-
wide masses that always ended in 
at least one girl passing out and was 
incessantly urged to incorporate 
the ideals of Catholicism into my 
not-so-Catholic lifestyle.

Beginning at the tender age of 3, 

I became familiar with the burden 
of Catholic guilt, and by the final 
year of my all-girls high school, 
had become acclimated to it. 
However, despite this specialized 
type of academia, I didn’t confront 
the truth of my spirituality until 
arriving on campus in September: I 
barely qualify as Catholic.

I may be able to recite the 

Apostles’ Creed by heart, but I 
didn’t actually know that’s what 
the hymn is called before looking 
it up two seconds ago (the browser 
tab is literally still open). Until 
the age of 13, I could mindlessly 
recite biblical responses, but then 
the Vatican decided to slightly 
modify them, and I never bothered 
to learn the differences. The book 
of Exodus and the “Passion of 
the Christ” were ingrained into 
my head, and I can still be called 
upon to regurgitate them when 
asked. But none of this makes me a 
dedicated member of the Catholic 
faith, and since arriving at the 
University, I have met people with 
half the exposure to Christianity 
as me, yet have twice the passion, 
three times the spirituality and 
four times the friends (whether 
that is religion’s or my personality’s 
fault is irrelevant).

Never before have I interacted 

with so many different faiths at 
once. Sure, a large percentage 
of my Catholic high school was 
Protestant, and a smaller, more 
noticeable percentage Jewish, but 

that was it. If anything, the student 
body left the school more religiously 
diverse than it was coming in: 
There definitely weren’t as many 
declared atheists my freshman year 
as there were my senior year. It was 
a mass religious conversion of born 
and bred Catholics to nonbelievers.

At the University, I have talked 

to students about faiths ranging 
from Hinduism to Evangelical 
Christianity, and I can’t help but 
notice an overarching trend in 
the people who demonstrate a 
compelling faith. Out of all the 
individuals I have met, those who 
share my background of lengthy 
Catholic 
education 
seem 
most 

likely to distance themselves from 
the faith, or simply give up on it.

In his standup act “Catholic 

School 
Sunglasses,” 
comedian 

Mike Birbiglia adeptly describes 
the effects of Catholic education, 
saying, “You can always tell who 
went to Catholic school as kids 
because they’re atheists. Because 
they really beat it out of you.” 
Those who have not are the ones 
who regularly attend church, a feat 
incomprehensible to me, yet easily 
practiced by many. Oddly, I can’t 
help but feel jealous and slightly 
intimidated by their passion and 
drive, while also feeling exhausted 
by most church-related activities.

In my English class, there’s a 

boy who, on the first day, humbly 
expressed how God is a major part 
of his life and how he recognizes 
and accepts all the love God has 
to give. Being the open-minded 
individual I am, I dismissed him 
almost 
immediately. 
But 
now, 

several weeks later, I have talked 
with him on numerous occasions 
and have grown to reluctantly 
respect, even slightly envy, this 
student’s incredible spirituality. 
He overflows with kindness and 
modesty, carries a Bible at all 
times and makes everyone (and 
by everyone I mean me) question 

their perpetual cynicism, all while 
never having experienced a day of 
Christian education.

I can’t help but wonder what 

causes this discrepancy. Christian 
education is meant to instill us 
with values and faith, and though 
I’m left with decent, manageable 
values, I can’t say the same for 
my faith. Patterns such as these 
are noticeable in the students I 
have met here. There are those 
who rarely attended mass before 
arriving at the University, but 
now attend it bi-weekly, and 
there are others who despite their 
previous 
distance 
from 
faith, 

now find themselves immersed 
in it. Although there’s an instant 
lifelong 
connection 
between 

survivors of Catholic education, 
these 
relationships 
are 
often 

highlighted by an absence of faith 
and nihilism.

But maybe I’m being too harsh. 

After all, whenever I encounter 
someone else who attended a 
single-sex Catholic high school, 
I’m immediately able to bond with 
them. It’s a strange thing to bond 
over, a shared bitterness toward the 
ritualistic niceties performed daily 
at these schools, but it’s bonding 
nonetheless. 
Catholic 
education 

has caused my faith to deteriorate, 
while 
secular 
education 
has 

produced devout Christians far 
more spiritual than I could ever 
hope to be.

Despite 
this 
realization, 
I 

can’t help but acknowledge that a 
Catholic education provided me 
with a stellar education, regardless 
of the number of Bible passages I 
memorized to fulfill it. My back 
might still be a little sore from 
carrying 
this 
heavy 
Catholic 

guilt, but it’s nothing a deep tissue 
massage and years of therapy can’t 
fix. When it comes down to it, I’m 
doing all right.

Raising the bar

Bystander intervention education necessary for bar employees
G

ov. Rick Snyder recently awarded $500,000 to fund sexual 
assault prevention initiatives at universities across the 
state. Under the Campus Sexual Assault Grant Program, 

the University will receive $20,000 to fund an initiative called Raise 
the Bar. In partnership with Wolverine Wellness and the Ann Arbor 
Campus Community Coalition, the University will create a program 
that teaches employees at local bars how to spot and prevent potential 
cases of sexual assault. Some might question if bystander intervention 
should be geared more toward the University community, but the 
overall idea presents a fresh lens in combatting sexual assault on 
campus. Targeting bystander intervention programs toward specific 
populations, such as bar employees, is a necessary step toward 
decreasing the likelihood of sexual assault in the state, in the Ann 
Arbor community and at the University.

Raise the Bar is one of many measures 

in place that attempts to create a culture of 
bystander intervention against sexual assault 
on campus. Oftentimes, bystanders find it hard 
to intervene when another person is involved 
in a dangerous situation, such as potential 
sexual assault. However, if that bystander is 
an employee, there might be a bigger obligation 
to keep the environment safe for all customers. 
Through the nature of their job, staff members 
at bars are aware of their surroundings, which 
makes them obvious candidates for stopping 
and preventing sexual assault. If all staff have 
to go through an intervention program, the 
consequences of sexual assault will be made 
even more apparent and thereby highlight the 
need to prevent it.

While many sexual assault prevention 

initiatives are directed at students, Raise 
the Bar charges members of the Ann Arbor 
community to assist in keeping students 
and other community members safe. Bars 
such as Rick’s American Cafe or Charley’s, 
two that are frequented by University 
students, are often staffed by both students 
and non-students. Therefore, sexual assault 
prevention and awareness knowledge among 
bar employees varies.

Recently, there has been a lot of attention 

placed on preventing sexual assault at 
Greek life events like fraternity parties, but 
ignoring bars would be a huge oversight. 
Bars and fraternity parties often have similar 
atmospheres, and it would be naive to think 
sexual assault is restricted to this setting. 
According to a study by the Center for Science 
in the Public Inerest, students tend to drink 

more at fraternity parties due to the copious 
amounts of free alcohol available. However, 
the study also notes that more students 
frequent campus bars than fraternity parties. 
This highlights the importance of bystander 
training among bartenders at these Ann 
Arbor establishments.

The University of Iowa and the University 

of North Carolina are two colleges that 
have implemented Raise the Bar in their 
communities. So far, the results have generally 
been positive. Though there’s a lack of 
quantitative data, management and employees 
at several establishments have found the 
training helpful and would recommend the 
program to others. In Iowa, Susan Junis, 
Rape Victim Advocacy Program education 
coordinator, believes it would be beneficial to 
tie bystander intervention to a business’ alcohol 
license. The University and state of Michigan 
should consider a similar initiative. This 
would not only incentivize bars to participate 
in the program, but also implement a uniform 
bystander intervention education among bar 
employees across the state.

Bar culture hasn’t always been known for 

having the safest atmosphere, but programs 
like Raise the Bar can help change this. 
Bartenders often act as leaders within a given 
bar, regulating what is or is not OK in that 
space. If employees are known for having a 
strong stance against sexual assault, customers 
will follow suit. Everyone has the responsibility 
of preventing sexual assault, and giving people 
the tools to spot and intervene in such situations 
can only contribute to a safer environment for 
all students at the University.

Typewriters, spiders and contentment

EVA ROOS | VIEWPOINT

I stared down at my motionless hands, curled 

in ready position. I noticed how each fingertip 
perfectly filled the circular keys of Papersmith, 
my favorite typewriter. Papersmith printed 
small letters with impeccable accuracy and a 
rich inky print, both which I now confidently 
deemed superior qualities, having spent the 
last six weeks learning the personalities of the 
family of similar typewriters. They all lived in 
the same chilly, quiet, wood-paneled space. The 
single-pane windows were streaked with fresh, 
cool droplets.

Tilting my head to the right, past the 

sopping beech tree branches which radiated 
a luscious, wet green, I could spot the dining 
hall, wood pile, library and lake which blended 
into the low hanging clouds. I tucked my 
orange striped fleece blanket tight around my 
legs, pulled my wooly hat strings down further 
towards my lap and turned a black knob click-
by-click to reel in my blank page. How on earth 
was I to begin writing a graduation speech 
to culminate the New England Literature 
Program — commonly called NELP — the 
ending of something that seemed too idyllic to 
acknowledge it ever begun?

I would have thought that distraction 

couldn’t exist in a space where I had no phone, 
no laptop, no iPod, no technology at all. But if 
there’s one thing I learned during that spring 
semester in the woods of New Hampshire 
at NELP, it’s that absolutely everything 
is deserving of my curiosity. Though I sat 
numbed by the daunting task which I had no 
solution to, I suddenly unbound my legs from 
my blanket, and scurried over to the adjacent 
wall. My friend Eric called my attention to our 
version of breaking news — there was a spider 

in the windowsill.

He and I crouched low, lit by a subtle 

afternoon glow fading in through the glass. 
Our breath fogged the panes as we watched 
with eager eyes the delicate angled legs 
which converged at a balloon-like sandy 
body, topped with an amber head. The spider 
lay as still as I had been seconds earlier 
seated in front of Papersmith. It was simply 
existing, watching, waiting. And we were 
too. We observed it, placed so buoyantly 
on its knitted web. Its home was precisely 
constructed, with every intersection intact 
and unbroken. I wondered about its legs. 
How could appendages so long and delicate 
be used and placed with such accuracy? Are 
they not difficult to keep track of? How does 
it know the exact patterns to knit its silk?

Because of my former dream to become 

an entomologist, I knew we were looking 
at an American house spider, which is 
exactly what it sounds like — the small silent 
crawlers that exist in almost every American 
basement. Not only is it incredibly common, 
but this particular spider was not necessarily 
doing anything phenomenal, or really doing 
anything at all. And yet we continued to 
survey it for minutes, fascinated. Sometimes 
voicing an observation, yet mostly, Eric and 
I watched in comfortable silence, taking in 
its perfection through dialogue contained 
within our heads. I felt like I could look 
forever and never understand that spider in 
its entirety. If I traced each intricacy with my 
eyes, would I remember its patterns?

Finally 
recognizing 
that 
we 
should 

continue 
writing 
on 
our 
respective 

typewriters, Eric seated in front of the muted 

blue Lois Lane, I suddenly laughed 
with a pang of realization. Never 
would this moment have happened 
last semester, seated in the crowded, 
laptop-filled, air-sealed study space 
that is the UGLi. This is not to say 
that American house spiders do not 
exist there, because they probably 
do. But would any of my friends 
have noticed if one appeared? And 
if it were spotted, would they care? 
Would I have cared? Or would my 
eyes be drawn back to screens of 
all sizes, directed instead towards 
Internet 
tabs 
and 
incoming 
 

text messages?

At 
NELP, 
I 
relearned 
to 

see. Whether it was spiders in 
windowsills, 
light 
streaming 

through beech leaves, a crackling 
fire in a wood stove or my own 
hands as I waited for them to 
begin punching letters, I felt like I 
was seeing it all for the first time. 
Looking back now at the six weeks 
I spent in New Hampshire, it shocks 
me how little I needed in order 
to feel fully content in any given 
moment. Before, did I walk blindly, 
never truly understanding where, 
or what, I was?

What I don’t know is everywhere, 

and if I observe long enough, I now 
know I can begin to find out.

New

FILM REVIEW
‘Sushi’ not political

Muddled cross-
cultural dialogue 

impedes new drama

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

With the current media land-

scape facing increasing pressure 
to depict issues of diversity in 
art, “East Side 
Sushi,” featuring 
both high-defini-
tion shots of food 
and a challenge 
to 
traditional 

interpretations 
of race, seems 
promising. 
Unfortunately, 
the film suffers 
from a predictable script that shies 
away from controversy, rendering 
the film ineffective.

Enthralled by the artistry of 

sushi, Juana (Diana Elizabeth 
Torres, “Private Number”) aban-
dons her fruit vending cart in 
favor of working at a Japanese 
restaurant. One of the chefs, Aki 
(Yutaka Takeuchi, “Letters from 
Iwo Jima”), notices her agility with 
the knife and takes her under his 
wing. Aki teaches her how to pick 
fish, make sushi rice and, eventu-
ally, champions her talent. How-
ever, Juana faces backlash from Mr. 
Yoshida (Roji Oyama, “Mumford”), 
the stern restaurant owner who 
refuses to promote her to her right-
ful position as a sushi chef.

“East Side Sushi” could have 

used this story to make power-
ful criticisms of racial stereotyp-
ing in America, but unfortunately, 
it plays it safe and oversimplifies 
the issues for feel-good activism. 
Though recognizably true to life, 

the characters are distilled only to 
their ideologies — the oppressed 
minority fighting for her rights 
to career advancement, the rac-
ist villain, the ally, etc. — and dull 
scriptwriting leaves little room 
for character development. Its 
storyline unfolds mechanically, 
following a pattern of inspira-
tion, problem, hard work, repeat, 
making the scenes predictable 
and leaving viewers antsy for the 
credits to roll.

The scope of “East Side Sushi” 

is inherently microcosmic, but 
its specific issue — Japanese res-
taurants keeping Latino workers 
hidden in the back to maintain 
“authenticity” — fails to feel rel-
evant to the current national dia-
logue about racial profiling.

Mr. Yoshida’s character lacks 

nuance. In general, “East Side 
Sushi” ‘s melodramatic dialogue 
veers into the contrite, making it 
impossible for tropes to mature 
into multifaceted characters. The 
ending’s racial tension is resolved 
too neatly to be impactful — Mr. 
Yoshida finally learns to do the 
right thing and ends the problem 
of racial stereotyping when real-
ly he is taking a stand and joining 
Juana and Aki in the fight.

Despite avoiding charged state-

ments, the film does show an 

appreciation 
for 
cross-cultural 

awareness. In a key moment, Aki 
calls Juana “Konnichi-Juana” 
and the camera zooms in on their 
two cups toasting to each other. 
Juana brings Japanese food to a 
wider audience by adding Mexi-
can flavors, leading her initially 
disapproving father to support 
her interest in a new cultural cui-
sine over the course of the film. 
Another great decision: unlike 
many films meant for an English-
speaking audience, “East Side 
Sushi” uses almost exclusively 
Spanish (with English subtitles) 
spoken in Juana’s home. This 
bilingualism is a crucial aspect 
of the multi-generational immi-
grant experience that rarely finds 
its way on screen.

However, 
the 
impact 
of 

these moments still can’t shine 
through 
the 
dull 
character 

development. The film serves up 
sound bites of popularly accepted 
ideas, content for the audience 
to vigorously nod their approval 
at and quote on Facebook when 
they return home, but nothing 
substantial. Not acknowledging 
how the full spectrum of race 
relations obscures the nuance in 
character motivations that would 
have made “East Side Sushi” the 
robust statement it wanted to be.

FILM REVIEW
‘Suffragette’ suffers

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

The more things change, the 

more they stay the same, right? 
That seems to be the resound-
ing message in 
Sarah Gavron’s 
(“Brick Lane”) 
latest, 
a 
dull 

British 
period 

piece about the 
women’s 
suf-

frage movement 
in 
England. 

The film fol-
lows four working class women as 
they become foot soldiers fighting 
(often literally) for the right to vote. 
Told in the manner of a PBS special 
screened for high school history 
courses, the film loses the punch it 
could pack.

Carey Mulligan (“An Educa-

tion”) is a dream as Maud, a young 
laundress who finds herself in the 
middle of the suffrage movement. 
Her performance is full of emotion-
al intensity, which is no surprise 
because Carey Mulligan is always a 
dream. Held against the lackluster 
performances of the other actress-
es, Mulligan is not enough to give 
“Suffragette” the heart it so greatly 
lacks. That heartlessness extends to 
Gavron’s palette, which, like many 
films in its genre, is characterized 
by blues and greys that scream, 
“This is London! It’s drab and drea-
ry!” Unfortunately, that message 
applies to the entire film. 

We must watch “Suffragette” 

through the lens of the modern 
world — a world in which many of 

the issues acknowledged (but not 
addressed) by the film still exist for 
women. The factory scenes seem 
oddly modern in the way work-
place sexual harassment is swept 
under the rug. Maud’s boss (Geoff 
Bell, “Kingsman: Secret Service”) 
gropes her in front of her husband 
Sonny (Ben Whishaw, “Spectre”) 
without causing Sonny much con-
cern. The women of “Suffragette” 
are at the same time powerless and 
powerful, an oxymoronic state that 
feels familiar even in 2015.

“Suffragette” 
falls 
into 
the 

recently expanding genre of social-
justice historical dramas (a genre 
categorized by powerhouse films 
like “Selma” and “Milk”). If histori-
cal dramas are responses to modern 
social movements, “Suffragette” 
would appear to be a response to 
the ever-dismissed, ever-important 
fight for women’s rights. However, 
“Suffragette” isn’t completely rep-
resentative of feminism today. The 
early stages of the suffrage move-
ment were not interested in racial 
equality. Therefore, the film is 
forced by nature of its subject mat-
ter to present a completely white-
washed version of feminism, a 
portrayal that alienates a large por-
tion of its target audience. We need 
a movie about the feminist move-
ment, but this is perhaps the wrong 
historical moment to try to make 
relevant to 2015 feminism.

In light of recent events, the 

treatment of the “militant” activi-
ties of the suffragettes is difficult to 
watch, mainly because what these 
real women did, and what their 
fictional counterparts are doing in 

“Suffragette,” is a form of terrorism. 
They cause no physical harm, but 
all their destructive actions hold 
the threat of harm. Explosions in 
mailboxes, bricks thrown through 
windows, the destruction of an 
entire home in the country all capi-
talize on fear (also known as ter-
ror) in order to make change. Why 
then are they called militants and 
not terrorists? That word choice is 
key because when labeled as mili-
tants their actions are dismissed 
as acceptable — acceptable because 
we agree with their cause. What 
“Suffragette” highlights, seemingly 
accidentally, is the fact that some-
times the “good guys” and the “bad 
guys” have the same strategies.

“Suffragette” didn’t come out on 

the wrong weekend, it came out in 
the wrong world, a world in which 
terrorism controls the lives of a con-
stantly growing number of people. 
The glorification of this type of 
activism, then, reads not only as 
insensitive but also elitist. “Suf-
fragette” could have possibly been 
saved had it decided to address the 
duality of the movement as both 
progressive in 1912 and problematic 
in 2015.

“Suffragette” could join the 

ranks of throwaway British period 
pieces (unique only by its lack of 
Keira Knightley) but the film’s con-
text within the modern world pro-
vides the possibility for longevity 
— it makes cultural points, but not 
necessarily the right ones. Maybe 
“Suffragette” will only be remem-
bered for what it does wrong, but at 
least it will (unlike many of its peer 
films) be remembered.

ALBUM REVIEW
No direction

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Let me preface this by saying I 

don’t like One Direction. I think 
they’re an artificially manufac-
tured boy band 
that has only 
found 
main-

stream success 
because 
their 

bubblegum 
pop 
ballads 

and 
charm-

ing good looks 
appeal to the 
entire 
teen-

aged female population of the 
world. However, just because 
I disapprove of their “X-Fac-
tor” origins and bland songs, 
it’s important to note that One 
Direction is relevant and their 
name will always be known. 
Their relevance ranges from the 
fact that all four of their albums 
topped the Billboard 200 chart 
to their impressive worldwide 
arena tours in support of each 
album they released. Monetari-
ly, One Direction was the high-
est-earning band of 2015, raking 
in $130 million. If a band can 
find so much success with music 
most critics would deem medio-
cre at best, you have to give them 
a little credit.

Over the course of the band’s 

five years of existence, they have 
managed to pump out an album 
every year accompanied by a 
worldwide arena tour in support 
of each album. 2015, however, was 
a turning point for One Direction. 
With Zayn Malik’s departure 
mid-tour, the band scrambled to 
reconfigure songs without the 
support of their strongest vocal-
ist. As if Directioners weren’t 
devastated enough, the new 
quartet announced in August 
that they would be taking an 
extended hiatus after the release 
of Made in the A.M. Of course the 
charming band reassured the 
heartbroken female population 
of the world that they would be 
back, but many have speculated 
that this is the end of the British 
boy-band. With such suspicions 
circulating its way through the 
music industry, special attention 
has and should be paid to Made 
in the A.M.

First, Made in the A.M. feels 

like a goodbye. The only lyrics 
that manage to make a state-
ment are those that bid some-
one (Directioners, maybe Malik, 
maybe a girl) farewell. In “Love 
You Goodbye,” the boys croon 
“It’s 
inevitable 
everything 

that’s good comes to an end / 
It’s impossible to know if after 

this we can still be friends.” The 
hopeless message in “Love You 
Goodbye” is then countered by 
the promising lyrics, “This is not 
the end / We can make it, you 
know it, you know” in “History.” 
Aside from the finality present-
ed in many of the lyrics, Made 
in the A.M. has a gloomier feel 
than their past albums; perhaps 
this change in mood is meant to 
mourn the One Direction they 
once were.

Aside from the fact that Made 

in the A.M. could be One Direc-
tion’s 
last 
album, 
attention 

should be paid to it because three 
of the 17 songs are actually quite 
promising. “Never Enough” is 
by far the most unique song on 
the album — when it first started 
playing I legitimately questioned 
whether or not Spotify was play-
ing the right song or not. “Never 
Enough” features intense horns, 
drums and bombastic a cappella 
that’s reminiscent of everything 
that was good about the ’80s. 
The next promising song on the 
album is “Olivia.” Recorded at 
Abbey Road Studios, the band 
made every effort to channel 
The Beatles in this song, and it 
paid off. Obviously, it’s nowhere 
near The Beatles’s level of artist-
ry, but it’s definitely a milestone 
moment for the boys who sing to 
arenas full of 12-year-olds. 

Unfortunately for 1D, aside 

from the aforementioned songs, 
there’s 
nothing 
different 
in 

this album. Once you’ve heard 
one One Direction song, you’ve 
heard them all. The same inno-
cent lyrics in one song carries 
through to them all; the pre-
dominantly pop sound charac-
terized by unimpressive vocals 
remains constant in each track 
manufactured for profit. Though 
you could argue that some songs 
are more promising than oth-
ers, at the end of the day, I think 
this could be One Direction’s 
final album. Realistically, boy 
bands have a shelf life of less 
than a decade with only half 
of those years as prime-time 
years. Maybe this hiatus will 
give the band time to individu-
ally mature as artists, allowing 
for their fanbase to mature as 
well. Who knows, in two years 
we could all be marveling at the 
new and improved One Direc-
tion, but for now, I am going to 
say that this is the end of an era. 
Made in the A.M. makes it clear 
that the One Direction we know 
today will not be the same One 
Direction we know a year from 
now.

That is, if they are even 

around a year from now.

Nina Simone, 
Buckley 
would strum 
his strings and stretch out his 
favorite compositions, turning 
tracks like “Sweet Thing” 
into a long meditation on the 
phrase, “We will walk and talk 
in gardens all misty wet with 
rain,” moving his voice up and 
down its register and scatting 
with breathless emotion, 
seemingly losing himself 
completely in the music and 
becoming not a performer but 
an artistic presence, someone 
who doesn’t just entertain you 
but stops you in your tracks 
and invades your psyche. He 
commands total attention and 
awe with what feel like the 
simplest of actions, reaffirming 
just why we care about music.

“Hallelujah” is, of course, 

Buckley’s most famous 
recording, but personally, I’ll 
never forget the first time I 
heard him cover Bob Dylan’s 
“Just Like a Woman.” While 
Dylan’s original is dripping 
with sexist sarcasm, one of 
many songs of his that serve 
as unbelievably coarse five-
minute-long insults, Buckley 
turns it into a crushing lament 
— not a self-righteous rant 
like Dylan but more of a sad-
if-hurtful, quietly lashing out 
meditation on why he and his 
partner should end it. Right 
at the song’s climax (“Ain’t 
it clear that I just can’t fit / I 
believe it’s time for us to quit”), 
Buckley stretches out that first 
crying “I” like he’s jumping 
out of an airplane, somehow 
releasing his parachute just in 
time, setting himself up for a 
perfect landing, those stabbing 
last words. It just might be the 

most gut-wrenching break-up 
song of all time.

Buckley’s “Just Like a 

Woman” has been available 
live for some time on what’s 
called the “Legacy Edition” 
of his EP Live at Sin-é (for 
my money the one absolutely 
essential Buckley album, more 
so than Grace). But as a studio 
recording it’s finally getting an 
official release on what’s going 
to be called You and I, an early 
demos record coming out next 
year.

I really think that everybody 

who wants to should be able 
to discover Buckley’s “lost” 
recordings, the ones that I 
personally just love so much, 
but I really can’t help feeling 
uneasy about this new album. 
It’s coming right on the heels 
of Montage of Heck: The 
Home Recordings, a newly 
released album credited to 
Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain. Since 
he committed suicide in 1994, 
Cobain’s memory has endured 
the ignominies of his private 
journals being published for 
mass consumption, his home 
movies being scrutinized in 
documentaries and endless 
books speculating about his 
personal life. We’ve already 
seen the vast catalog of 
unreleased Nirvana tracks 
come out of the vaults on the 
With the Lights Out box set, 
and this “new” collection of 
Cobain’s home recordings feels 
pointless and exploitative, one 
more cash-in on a dead man’s 
legacy.

More and more record 

labels seem to be clearing 
out the vaults of old bands 
with nostalgic appeal, and 
I worry that this might be 
coming at the expense of 
young, up-and-coming artists. 
This isn’t exactly a brand 
new phenomenon — The 
Beatles’ Anthology came out 
20 years ago — but more and 
more artists that have been 
long bootlegged, like The 
Beach Boys and Bob Dylan, 
have spent the later parts of 
their careers releasing old 
unreleased recordings, often 
to commercial success and 
acclaim. We’re now seeing this 
trend expand to include bands 

that don’t have anywhere near 
the name recognition as these 
legends. Nineties alt-rockers 
Pavement are in the middle 
of a series called The Secret 
History, pairing old albums 
with collections of radio 
sessions and live recordings 
from the era, as well as songs 
that weren’t good enough to 
make the cut the first time 
around. But since Pavement 
already has a built-in audience, 
I suppose a makeshift record 
like this is easier to sell than a 
fresh debut album from a young 
garage-rock band still looking 
to develop its sound.

Obviously, there are 

superfans who look forward to 
buying all these artifacts, and 
I can’t blame them for that. 
There’s something that can be 
sickly fascinating about all the 
“what ifs” of music history. 
What if Brian Wilson hadn’t 
had a mental breakdown and 
The Beach Boys had pulled off 
Smile? What if Nick Drake had 
been famous in his time? What 
if Biggie and 2Pac hadn’t been 
shot?

So yeah, I’m going to listen 

to the new Buckley stuff. Even 
though the first preview of 
You and I, a cover of “Everyday 
People,” is disappointingly 
bad fit for Buckley’s somewhat 
funk-less style, you never know 
what secret greatness the 
record might hold. As uneasy 
as I feel about the potential 
exploitation of artists and the 
swindling of fans who can’t 
contain their appetites for 
more songs from their heroes, 
rarities and vault-clearing 
releases can lead to the public 
discovering some incredible old 
music and filling in the stories 
of legendary enigmas. We buy 
up and listen to boxed sets of 
full recording sessions, discs 
of unreleased tracks, because 
we want to piece together 
shattered genius. We want to 
imagine the unknown and solve 
the puzzle that could show us 
the greatest album of all time.

TV REVIEW
Bold Bob and Dave

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

From 1995-1998, the sketch 

comedy series “Mr. Show with 
Bob and David” aired on HBO. 
During 
its 

tenure, 
“Mr. 

Show” housed 
and 
devel-

oped 
some 

of the most 
significant 
and 
popular 

personalities 
in 
entertain-

ment, 
including 
Jack 
Black 

(“School of Rock”), Sarah Sil-
verman (“The Sarah Silver-
man Program”) and Mary Lynn 
Rajskub (“24”), among others. 
And perhaps the greatest con-
tributions were the talents of 
the titular duo, Bob Odenkirk 
and David Cross. Both prolific 
voices, Odenkirk now leads the 
“Breaking Bad” spinoff “Better 
Call Saul,” while Cross is best 
known for his role as the oblivi-
ous Tobias Fünke on “Arrested 
Development.”

Now, thanks to Netflix, the 

influential series returns under 
the shortened title “W/ Bob and 
David.” Presented with an expe-
rienced hand that comes with 
17 years of personal and profes-
sional development, the show 
brings back the influential, fast-
paced comedy that defined its 
earlier run. The new episodes, 
like their classic counterparts, 
comfortably edge into the risky, 
absurd and offensive.

At the core of “W/ Bob and 

David” ’s success are the well-
placed segues that establish a 
distinct flow between the vari-
ous, interlocking sketches, which 
utilize both live and pre-filmed 
elements. Directed by the expe-
rienced team of Keith Truesdell 
(“Jimmy Kimmel Live”) and 
Jason Woliner (“The Last Man 
On Earth”), “W/ Bob and David” 
balances its formats well, guid-
ing viewers relatively seamlessly 
into each new segment.

“Episode One” puts this skill 

on display as it opens with a doc-
tor telling Mike (Paul F. Tomp-
kins, “BoJack Horseman”) that 

he needs to stop eating red meat. 
After a cut to credits, Odenkirk 
and Cross emerge in front of the 
audience from a time machine/
portable toilet as they learn the 
consequences of using a “real-
time machine” as opposed to a 
“real time machine” (hyphens 
are tricky). After some explana-
tion, Cross decides to use the toi-
let function of the machine and, 
once finished, walks seamlessly 
into a new sketch.

The latest segment, which 

takes place over a card game, 
details the ambitious New Year’s 
resolutions made by a group of 
middle-aged friends. Among the 
dreams of becoming a director, 
a judge and the Pope is Mike’s 
humble goal to change his diet. In 
contrast to the universal support 
his friends receive, Mike is met 
with rejection as one buddy says, 
“You can’t learn to not like some-
thing.” The statement proves 
prophetic as the friends reinvent 
themselves and Mike gives into 
temptation. These success sto-
ries pave the way for the rest of 
the episode, providing key transi-
tional elements. Odenkirk’s Pope 
Judah advertises for a Kosher 
delivery service while the other 
characters appear in some way 
or the other throughout the sub-
sequent sketches. This helps to 
craft underlying premises that 
often mock those in positions of 
authority or influence.

The proper implementation 

of these segues and recurring 
characters turn a collection of 

sketches into a cohesive whole 
and provide the strongest epi-
sodes. “Episode Three” has the 
most trouble establishing these 
initial connections and struggles 
to find an early voice. The indi-
vidual parts are funny, but they 
have trouble coming together 
into a single voice as opposed to 
the other episodes.

“Episode Four,” for instance, 

sheds a light on parenting and 
how it can go awry. Cross’s 
mother frustrates her son by 
comparing his accomplishments 
to his slacker brother Donny 
(also played by Cross) on the 
faux-reality 
show 
“Amazing 

Moms,” which claims, “A child 
in jail is a hug waiting to be 
set free.” Meanwhile, a pair of 
conservative Christian parents 
rejects their son after he claims 
Hell isn’t real and that God lets 
everyone into Heaven — even 
monsters like Adolf Hitler and 
Jeffrey Dahmer.

Whether it’s tackling reli-

gion, slavery or the c-word, 
“W/ Bob and David” attacks all 
subjects with experienced con-
fidence. Odenkirk, Cross and 
many of their collaborators are 
industry mainstays, and this 
confidence translates into seam-
less, uncompromising comedic 
attempts. Like most sketch com-
edy, not everything is perfect, 
but “W/ Bob and David” main-
tains the sharp comedic edge 
of “Mr. Show” while serving as 
a reminder as to why Bob and 
David were so influential.

NEW MEDIA NOTEBOOK
#PrayForParis’s gap

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

In 2015 alone, our world has 

faced a series of violent outbreaks 
and conflicts, affecting innocent 
people on both a national and 
global scale. But even in these 
moments 
of 
darkness, 
our 

society 
has 
stood 
together, 

especially after the tragedy that 
struck Paris last Friday in what 
became the deadliest attack 
against France since World War 
II. With 132 civilians murdered 
and hundreds more wounded 
by ISIS terrorists, the attacks 
in Paris demonstrated another 
devastating 
blow 
against 

humanity. This was also the 
country’s second major terrorist 
attack this year, following the 
Charlie 
Hebdo 
shooting 
in 

early January. As horrific and 
despicable as these attacks were, 
what surprised me the most 
was how viral the attacks had 
become online.

Within the 24 hours of the 

terrorist attacks in Paris on 
Friday, people from all over the 
world showed an outpouring 
of support for the French 
on 
virtually 
every 
social 

media outlet. Twitter users 
tweeted their thoughts with 
the 
hashtag 
#PrayForParis; 

Instagram flooded with the 
now-circulating 
symbol 
of 

the Eiffel Tower attached to a 
peace sign; Snapchat created 
a filter with “Pray for Paris” 
scrawled in French and in 
English over a red, white and 
blue background; many people 
on my Facebook feed, including 
myself, have overlaid the colors 
of the French flag on their 
profile pictures. I was fascinated 
by how rapidly everyone showed 
their solidarity with the people 
of Paris. And while it’s uplifting 
to see everyone stand together 

with France in such a timely 
manner, it’s imperative that our 
society also recognizes the other 
atrocities around the world that 
the media has unfortunately 
neglected to publicize.

While 
scrolling 
through 

my newsfeed, I happened to 
find a report from Mic.com on 
numerous 
suicide 
bombings 

in Beirut, Lebanon that killed 
43 and injured 239 this past 
Thursday. In addition to that, 
I found another story about a 
recent instance of a terrorist 
attack in Baghdad, where a 
suicide bomber had killed at least 
19 people at a funeral in a mosque. 
In April, a group of al-Shabab 
militants killed 147 people at 
Garissa University in Kenya. 
Considering how much attention 
the Paris attacks received, it 
felt somewhat discriminatory 
that the media responded more 
quickly to attacks in Paris than in 
Beirut, Baghdad and Kenya. Does 
this mean that the media bases 
its focus solely on how drastic the 
situation is, where the location of 
the situation is and how many 
casualties and injuries there are?

It’s easy for people to simply 

dismiss the strife and brutality 
occurring 
in 
third-world 

countries 
because 
we 
have 

become so desensitized to the 
constant radical violence and 
terrorism in those places. It 
also makes sense that people 

respond more heavily toward 
the attacks in Paris, most likely 
because France hasn’t endured 
as 
many 
extreme 
terrorist 

attacks as Beirut, Baghdad and 
Kenya. However, this shouldn’t 
be the kind of groupthink our 
society employs in our everyday 
lives. No matter who the victim 
is, people are people, regardless 
of what region, race or ethnicity 
they belong to. The murdered 
innocents in Kenya, Baghdad 
and 
Beirut 
matter 
just 
as 

much as any of the murdered 
innocents in Paris.

In 
terms 
of 
how 
these 

events integrate into social 
media, would it make sense 
for Facebook to also have a 
Lebanese flag overlay to show 
solidarity for the victims in 
Beirut? Or possibly create a 
Snapchat filter for the Kenyan 
students who perished? I’m not 
entirely sure. But it wouldn’t 
hurt to write a status about 
Beirut, Baghdad and Kenya 
on Facebook, create a hashtag 
on Twitter or at least engage 
people in discussions about 
these kinds of atrocities. While 
social media helps connects us 
to others around the world, we 
need to remind ourselves that 
it also manipulates our cultural 
understanding and outlets like 
Facebook and Twitter tend to 
capitalize on these events. As 
Americans, we are only limited 
to what we perceive outside the 
country through what we see 
online, on television and on our 
mobile devices. To stand united 
as a world against inhumane 
acts of evil, we must understand 
and acknowledge the people 
who are also being affected by 
the same kind of evil. Once we 
achieve that, then our world 
can hope to live as one truly 
interconnected, peaceful and 
loving society.

Social 

media raises 
awareness, but 
manipulates us.

I can’t blame 
the superfans 

for buying these 

box sets.

‘M’ saves season 

on last play

BLOOMINGTON — The 

Michigan football team’s season 
vanished tonight, only to reappear, 
disappear and reappear again. 
Hundreds of 
thousands of 
fans around the 
country lived 
and died and 
lived again as a 
four-hour game 
wound toward 
a close.

Indiana 

tugged every 
string, took 
every gamble 
and, oh God, the Hoosiers were 
going to pull it off.

The inner monologue of a 

Michigan fan had to be verging on 
insanity as Jordan Howard scored 
a go-ahead touchdown with 2:52 
remaining, then Jake Rudock led 
a touchdown drive to tie it, then 
overtime, another overtime and 
one last goal-line stand.

Hold them! Let them score! 

Hurry up! Slow down! Why are 
they running?! Touchdown! 
Overtime! Another play? Overtime! 
Not again. More of this! Yes! Oh, 
please n-YES!

In the end, the ball was in 

Mitchell Paige’s hands. It was 
fourth down, in double overtime, 
on the goal line. If Paige could just 
come down with Nate Sudfeld’s 
pass, the Wolverines and Hoosiers 
were likely headed for triple 
overtime. But Delano Hill stuck 
his hand in and ripped the ball out. 
Game over.

Hill didn’t steal victory from the 

hands of defeat, but he stole it from 
the hands of chaos — more chaos 
— on a night that had nothing if 

not that.

Michigan 48, Indiana 41, and a 

season still alive.

All week, the talk was of the 

Wolverines’ renewed hope for 
a Big Ten Championship berth 
thanks to Nebraska’s wild upset of 
Michigan State. Win the next two, 
and Michigan could be playing 
for the Big Ten East title the last 
weekend of November.

That meant beating Indiana 

first, something the Wolverines 
have had little trouble doing since, 
well, ever. Since 1968, the Hoosiers 
have beaten Michigan only once. 
But nothing went according to 
plan on Saturday.

Indiana nearly ran Michigan 

off with its tempo, wearing out a 
defense that earlier this season 
rang up three straight shutouts. 
Riding the legs of Jordan Howard, 
the Hoosiers bludgeoned a 
seemingly un-bludgeonable 
defensive line. Howard ran for 238 
yards alone — nearly four times as 
many as Michigan State ran for as 
a team when it beat the Wolverines 
one month ago.

When Howard got in the 

end zone with fewer than three 
minutes to play, it looked bleak for 
Michigan — not just for Saturday, 
but for the season.

If Indiana hung on, Michigan 

would be all but eliminated from 
division contention. The goal-line 
stand at Minnesota two weeks 
ago? Moot. The game against Ohio 
State in two weeks? The stakes 
would be considerably lower.

Michigan pulled a miraculous 

drive out, though, bringing the ball 
within a sniff of the goal line. With 
six seconds left, when fifth-year

‘M’ wins fourth regional 
title in past five seasons

By LANEY BYLER

For the Daily

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

cross country team claimed the 
NCAA Great Lakes Regional 
title Friday at the Tom Zimmer 
Championship 
Course 
in 

Madison. The victory earned the 
Wolverines a spot in the NCAA 
Championships next week.

The 
seventh-ranked 

Wolverines took first place in a 
31-team pool with a final score of 
69 points — a solid 10-point lead 
over runner-up Notre Dame, 
which finished with a final 
score of 79 points. The regional 
title is Michigan’s fourth in the 
past five seasons and the 10th in 
program history.

The Wolverines were led 

by junior Erin Finn, who took 
fifth with a time of 20:44.3 
and was the highest-placing 
Michigan runner. While strong 
winds made the 6,000-meter 
course more challenging, Finn 
believed her toughest obstacle 
was holding back while other 
runners were putting everything 
they had into the race.

“It was just managing myself,” 

Finn said, “knowing that I 
wanted to race conservatively 
so I would have more in the tank 
for next week, while other girls 

were racing really hard.”

Despite Finn’s solid finish, 

she credited the rest of her team 
for pulling off the win, noting 
that her teammates’ proximity 
to one another during the race 
helped the Wolverines claim the 
regional title.

“It’s definitely a whole-team 

contribution, and especially in 
a team sport like cross country,” 
Finn said. “One leader doesn’t 
really matter as much as the 
stretch. So it’s good that I got 
things going, but it mattered 
more that I had 
girls coming in 
close after me. 
That’s 
what 

helped us win 
today.”

Michigan 

had six runners 
place in the top 
25, 
including 

fifth-year senior Anna Pasternak, 
who took 11th with a time of 
20:54.7. Despite being a part of 
four Great Lakes Regional teams, 
Pasternak 
had 
never 
placed 

higher than 30th at the meet.

Senior Shannon Osika took 

16th shortly after Pasternak 
crossed the line, with a final 
time 
of 
20:59.6. 
Redshirt 

sophomores Gina Sereno and 
Jaimie Phelan finished 17th and 

20th, respectively, with times of 
21:00.0 and 21:01.4.

Michigan 
coach 
Mike 

McGuire, who has coached all 
of the Great Lakes Regional 
titles in Michigan history, said 
there was still work to do before 
the 
NCAA 
Championships 

next Saturday. He stressed that 
maintaining health and cleaning 
up small mistakes will help the 
team reach its ultimate goals.

“You always want to come 

out ranked higher than when 
you went in,” McGuire said. 

“We definitely 
want to strive 
to 
get 
on 

a 
podium, 

which 
is 

top 
four. 

We’ve 
had 

performances 
at 
various 

times in the 

season that would be worthy of 
podium finishes. We just have to 
get it done. It will take our best 
efforts, but it’s not an effort that 
we’re not capable of.”

The Wolverines will look to 

accomplish those goals next 
Saturday at the 2015 NCAA 
Championships in Louisville, 
Kentucky. It’s Michigan’s last 
chance to add to a successful 
season.

The Michigan women’s cross country team finished first out of 31 teams and beat second-place Notre Dame by 10 points.

MEN’S CROSS COUNTRY
Ferlic paces Michigan to 
regional championship

First-place finish 
puts ‘M’ in NCAA 
Championships for 
fifth straight season

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

Fifth-year 
senior 
Mason 

Ferlic was not going to lose.

In the last 400 meters of 

the Great Lakes Regional in 
Madison, he was head-to-head 
with the same athlete he lost 
the individual title to at the Big 
Ten Championship on Nov. 1, 
and Ferlic refused to be second 
again. 

Ferlic 
didn’t 
lose 
it. 
He 

crossed the finish line at 30:18.3 
to claim the win over Purdue’s 
Matt McClintock, who crossed 
just two seconds after. Ferlic’s 
team did well too, as the No. 5 
Michigan men’s cross country 
team won the event. 

“Coming down the home 

stretch, I knew I had the win,” 
Ferlic said. “McClintock and I 
have been great rivals, but it was 
nice to flip the tables on him. I 
have a lot of respect for that guy, 
but I had a little bit of fire under 
me in the last 400 meters of the 
race — where me and him were 
duking it out. I said to myself, 
‘I’m not losing to him today.’

“I just wanted to make it 

a solid effort from the gun. I 
wanted to settle into a rhythm. 
I knew if I started off well, I was 
going to be able to do it if I stayed 
relaxed and controlled myself. I 
told myself I was going to go for 
a win.”

Not only did he go for the win, 

the team did, too. 

This 
weekend, 
Michigan 

travelled 
to 
Wisconsin 
to 

compete in the Great Lakes 
Regional. As is becoming the 
norm for the Wolverines, they 
captured the title with a total of 
67 points on the 10,000-meter 
course. All five of their scorers 

finished within the top 25, with 
redshirt junior Nick Renberg 
running a personal best of 
31:08.4 to place 15th. 

The commanding win comes 

right after Michigan claimed 
the Big Ten title and just before 
it will compete at the NCAA 
Championships. The last time 
the team won both the Big Ten 
and Great Lakes Regional title, 
in 1997, the team placed fourth at 
the NCAA Championships. That 
year, current Michigan coach 
Kevin Sullivan placed second in 
the nation.

The goal for the current 

Wolverine team is to replicate 
the performance from 1997 with 
a top-four team finish. Sullivan 
just wants his team to be on that 
podium. 

“It’s a big deal to win a regional 

championship,” Sullivan said. 
“When 
we 

came in this 
season, 
this 

was our goal. 
But now, we’re 
starting 
to 

reevaluate 
our goals. We 
wanted to be 
a top team at 
nationals, but 
now we would 
love to take a 
crack at being one of the top four 
teams.”

This is the second time in 

three 
years 
that 
Michigan 

has claimed the Great Lakes 
Regional title. The Wolverines 
have won the event just four 
times in program history. 

A part of the team that made 

history, besides Renberg and 
Ferlic, were junior Ben Flanagan 
in 11th (30:54.2), senior Tony 
Smoragiewiecz in 18th (31:12.0) 
and redshirt sophomore Aaron 
Baumgarten in 22nd (31:15.4). 
Other 
Michigan 
finishers 

included senior August Pappas 
in 31st (31:31.5) and fifth-year 
senior Nick Posada in 60th 
(32:15.7). 

Notably, the women’s cross 

country team also took home the 
title. This is the second time in 
program history that both the 
men’s and women’s teams have 
won in the same year — the last 
time being in 2013. 

But that’s not to say the 

Wolverines ran faster than they 
ever have Friday. Ferlic thinks 
they just ran smart. 

“I don’t think it was a heroic 

effort by the team,” Ferlic said. 
“We did what we had to do. 
We were smart. We got the job 
done. We came out with a good 
amount of emotional energy 
without spending too much 
physical energy — which is what 
you want to do.”

The athletes were facing up 

to 
25-mile-per-hour 
winds. 

For Ferlic and other Michigan 
athletes, 
the 
key 
was 
to 

recognize the challenge that 

the 
wind 

presented 
when it was 
facing 
them. 

Ferlic said it 
felt like “you 
were standing 
still,” 
but 

when 
the 

wind was at 
their back, the 
runners could 
make up for 

the time lost. In doing so, the 
athletes struck a balance and 
matched their efforts against 
and with the wind. 

Regardless of the race strategy 

when dealing with weather, not 
much else has changed these 
past few meets. And, most likely, 
not much will change for the last 
meet of the season at the NCAA 
Championships in Louisville, 
Kentucky, on Nov. 21. 

“We have a good thing going 

this year,” Sullivan said. “It’s 
like, if it’s not broke, don’t fix it. 
We’ve had the same intentions 
with the same goals in mind all 
season, and we didn’t change 
much up. We’re not going to 
change much up going into 
nationals, either.” 

“Coming down 

the home 

stretch, I knew I 

had the win.”

The finish line

This is the position in which 

the Michigan cross country 
teams have put themselves. It 
was Thursday, the day before 
the Great Lakes Regional meet 
that decides qualifiers for the 
NCAA Championships, and the 
Wolverines 
were talking 
about the 
regional meet 
as a warmup.

“It’s just 

sort of an 
expectation at 
this point that 
we qualify for 
the national 
meet,” said 
Gina Sereno, 
a redshirt sophomore on the 
women’s team.

That’s what happens when 

you qualify for the NCAA 
Championships 13 straight 
times, six by winning the 
regional title, as the Michigan 
women have. In any sport, at any 
level, athletes refuse to look past 
any competition to the next. For 
the Wolverines, qualifying is a 
given. It’s the big picture they’re 
after now, the big picture they 
train the whole year for.

That big picture finishes 

Saturday at the NCAA 
Championships. And for the 
first time in recent memory, 
both teams are among the 
top contenders — the men are 
ranked No. 5 in the latest poll, 
the women No. 7.

So much of the focus is on 

that event that the Michigan 
women contemplated holding 
back a bit in the regional meet 
to conserve energy for this 
weekend. This is their biggest 
day of the year, and that’s the 
end of it. There’s no bowl game, 
no long postseason tournament, 
no national-television exposure. 
It’s intrinsically motivated: 
They compete to finish the best 
they can, with no wide-ranging 

implications beyond that.

Both Michigan teams will 

be right in the middle of things 
on race day, but a closer look 
reveals the different spots in 
which they find themselves.

The women have established 

themselves more in recent 
seasons. The Wolverines 
finished fifth at the NCAA 
Championships in 2012 and 
fourth in 2013, garnering a No. 1 
preseason ranking to start 2014.

But when you train the whole 

year for one event, everything 
has to fall into place for that 
event to work out. Last year, it 
didn’t. Two of Michigan’s top 
runners, Erin Finn and Shannon 
Osika, were injured late in the 
season. Neither ran in the NCAA 
Championships, and the team 
finished 18th.

Still, the powerhouse coach 

Mike McGuire has built doesn’t 
crumble with a couple of 
injuries. Finn, now a junior, 
and Osika, a senior, returned 
and stayed healthy. After the 
misfortune of last year, McGuire 
knows that’s no small feat.

“I think 

the biggest 
difference 
between last 
year and this 
year is we’re 
a team that 
physically is 
intact,” he said.

Other than 

that, the team 
is similar, with 
Finn, Osika 
and three finishers from the 
NCAA Championships in 2014 
leading the way. But last year’s 
ending wasn’t the Wolverines’ 
last setback.

On Nov. 1, Michigan traveled 

to the Big Ten Championships 
as a heavy favorite. But for 
the third straight year, the 
Wolverines failed to win.

Fortunately for them, they 

still had more competitions left 
— including the one that matters 
most.

“We’re just looking for a 

shot at redemption, really,” 
Sereno said. “We didn’t do as 
well at the Big Ten meet as 
we were expected to do, and I 
think everyone is looking for an 
opportunity to show what we’re 
really made of.”

* * *

In some ways, the men’s 

team’s path has been opposite 
the women’s. The men had 
missed four of 10 NCAA 
Championships heading into 
this season. For them, rather 
than a disappointment, 2014 was 
a building block. Under first-
year coach Kevin Sullivan, they 
jumped to 11th in the national 
meet — their highest finish 
since 2003 — and used that as a 
springboard to this year.

Two weeks ago, while the 

women’s team let a Big Ten 
championship slip away, the 
men’s team got that monkey off 

its back. After 
three straight 
second-place 
finishes, 
Michigan 
took home the 
title this year, 
its first since 
1998.

“The taste 

of almost 
being it and 
having the 

disappointment, those are tough 
bus rides back from the previous 
Big Ten Championships,” said 
fifth-year senior co-captain 
Mason Ferlic.

The year before Ferlic arrived 

at Michigan, the Wolverines 
took eighth at the Big Ten 
Championships. Since then, they 
finished in the top three in four 
straight years — but could never 

win.

“You’re kind of searching for 

the what-if,” Ferlic said.

So Michigan kept building, 

and this year there was no going 
back. In each of the previous 
four seasons, the Wolverines 
were in contention, but 
everything had to go right and 
everyone had to run perfectly 
for them to win.

This year, they were the clear 

favorite. Led by Ferlic — who 
has now been the top Michigan 
finisher in his last 17 races — 
they took home the trophy.

The Wolverines have rolled 

forward — more quickly, 
Sullivan admitted, than he 
expected when he took the 
job — to put themselves in this 
position so soon. No one on 
the current roster has been on 
a team that missed the NCAA 
Championships, but never have 
the Wolverines had a legitimate 
shot of reaching the podium as 
they do this season.

“We have the guys,” Ferlic 

said. “The team is solidified. 
We’ve put in all our hard work. 
This is the fun part. It’s where 
we get to prove it and race.

“We’re not coming into the 

postseason here feeling like we 
missed something mid-season. 
We’re coming in feeling like we 
did everything that needed to be 
done. And now it’s just time to 
prove it.”

* * *

The women have been in 

position for years but have 
struggled to put it all together 
lately. The men have been 
behind and haven’t put it all 
together until lately. This 
weekend, they will take the 
same bus to Louisville for a 
race in which they both have a 
chance.

As with any team, their 

fortunes have fluctuated over 
the years. This season, both are 

healthy, both are confident and 
both are talented. Both feel like 
things might finally be lining up 
for them.

“At this point, yes,” McGuire 

said. “Things can change. It’s a 
fickle sport. You have to be good, 
and you have to be lucky. We feel 
that we’re pretty good, and if the 
good fortunes stay with us, I like 
where this season can finish up.”

The preparations are almost 

over, and the anticipated day 
is almost here. Maybe things 
will bounce Michigan’s way 
Saturday. Maybe they won’t. 
All the Wolverines can do is put 
themselves in a position for it to 
come down to that.

“If you don’t feel prepared 

at this point, you won’t ever 
be prepared,” Ferlic said. “The 
work’s been done. The hay’s in 
the barn, you could say.”

FIELD HOCKEY
‘M’ season ends 
in quarterfinals

Wolverines upset 
Wake Forest, then 

fall to UNC in 

NCAA Tournament

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

For the No. 1 North Carolina 

field hockey team, the situation 
felt familiar.

Not 
only 
was 
the 
team 

playing on its home turf — it was 
also with a lineup consisting 
of 
six 
upperclassmen 
and 

two sophomores with NCAA 
Tournament experience. On the 
other hand, No. 10 Michigan had 
a lineup consisting of just three 
players from the Wolverines’ 
last tournament appearance.

After a 2-1 upset victory over 

No. 7 Wake Forest, Michigan 
(7-1 Big Ten, 18-5 overall) faced 
the experienced Tar Heels on 
Sunday, but came up short in a 
1-0 loss.

“The fact that we played them 

in preseason really helped,” said 
freshman forward Emma Way. 
“We knew we could’ve beaten 
them.”

North Carolina (4-2 ACC, 

20-2 overall), took control of the 
game from the start. The Tar 
Heels outshot the Wolverines, 
11-2 in the first half and 4-0 in 
the second. North Carolina also 
earned four corners compared 
to only one for Michigan.

In Saturday’s game, led by 

redshirt 
sophomore 
forward 

Carly Bennett, the Wolverines 
outshot the Demon Deacons 8-2 
in the first half and netted two 
goals.

In the second half, Michigan 

halted Wake Forest’s 11 shots, 
anchored by first-team All-Big 
Ten goalie Sam Swenson. 

Against 
the 
Tar 
Heels, 

Swenson again stepped up to 
the challenge, saving six shots, 
in the first half, including two 
in a row in the 25th and 26th 
minutes.

“She’s one of the best goalies 

in the nation,” said Michigan 
coach Marcia Pankratz. “Our 
team 
feels 
very 
confident 

playing in front of her. She helps 
us become more aggressive in 
our tactics.”

Though the Wolverines lost 

in the quarterfinals, Pankratz 
remained optimistic about the 
future of Michigan’s young 
team.

“(The tournament) teaches 

them 
to 
have 
experience,” 

Pankratz said of the Wolverines’ 
younger players. “The seniors 
brought this program back into 
elite status in the nation, and the 
younger players will gain that 
tradition.”

Michigan made its first NCAA 

Tournament appearance in three 
years, though Pankratz believed 
her squad’s No. 9 ranking last 
year made it deserving of a spot 
in the Sweet 16.

The 
Wolverines’ 
youth 

was on display in Sunday’s 
game, as Pankratz included 
six sophomores in the starting 
lineup.

“For a team where 90 percent 

of the players have never played 
in the tournament yet in their 
lives,” Pankratz said, “they 
played with poise, confidence 
and maturity. I couldn’t be more 
proud of them.”

Though this season ended 

on a low note, Michigan has 
much to look forward to in 
coming years. Next season, 
Way, Bennett and Swenson will 
be juniors and with a taste of 
NCAA Tournament experience 
behind them, the Wolverines 
will be the experienced team.

Wolverines roll in opener

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

On 
Friday 
night, 
Aubrey 

Dawkins put an exclamation 
point on 100 years of Michigan 
men’s 
basketball.

With 

seven 
minutes left in the first half 
against 
Northern 
Michigan, 

the sophomore guard elevated, 
stretched out his left hand and 
threw down a put-back dunk off 
a missed 3-pointer from redshirt 
sophomore Duncan Robinson.

It was a highlight in a night 

meant to celebrate a century 
of Michigan men’s basketball 
seasons. But Friday showed that 
Team 100 is far from 100 percent 
of the way to where it wants to 
be, even as it rolled past the 
Wildcats, 70-44.

The 25th-ranked Wolverines 

(1-0) looked sluggish early in the 
first half.

Four turnovers in a span of 

just over two minutes kept the 
Wildcats in the game deep into 
the first frame, and they trailed 
by just four points with eight 
minutes remaining in the half.

“(It’s) just a little rust — first 

game,” 
Dawkins 
said. 
“(We 

were) rushing a little bit trying to 
make a really good play instead 
of making the right play.”

Early in the half, senior guard 

Caris LeVert tried to dish to a 
teammate at the low post. But a 
miscommunication resulted in 
no one being on the receiving 
end of his pass, and Northern 
Michigan took over possession. 
Later, after grabbing a defensive 
board, Robinson drove to the 
rim but couldn’t decide between 
whether 
to 
shoot 
or 
pass. 

Instead, he jumped, hesitated 
and a Wildcat player got a hand 
on the ball, forcing a jump ball 
that stayed with the Wildcats. 
Less than two minutes later, 
sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman tried to 

pirouette and pass to an open 
D.J. Wilson, but the redshirt 
freshman forward wasn’t ready 
for it, and the ball went off 
Wilson’s hand out of bounds.

But 
then, 
Dawkins 
took 

flight, and Michigan took off. 
Following his electrifying dunk, 
the Wolverines couldn’t miss.

A 
minute 

after, 
LeVert 

took 
two 

dribbles 
and 

two 
strong 

strides to take 
him from the 
perimeter 
to 

the hoop for a 
layup. On the 
next possession, junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. stole the ball 
and finished with a strong layup 
of his own.

Michigan 
had 
found 
its 

rhythm. Better late than never.

On the Wolverines’ next trip 

down the court, Wilson backed 
down his defender and hit a 
six-foot 
turnaround 
jumper. 

Sophomore forward Kameron 
Chatman got in on the action 
next with a layup, and Dawkins 

— who started the streak — 
ended 
it 
with 
a 
3-pointer, 

before Michigan missed its next 
attempt. Six straight buckets 
swung the pendulum in the 
Wolverines’ direction to give 
them a 10-point lead going into 
half.

In the second half, Michigan 

wasted 
little 

time 
getting 

back 
into 

its 
groove. 

Dawkins 
dunked again 
and hit a three 
in the opening 
three minutes 
as 
Michigan 

coasted.

Both Michigan coach John 

Beilein 
and 
LeVert 
called 

Dawkins’ performance efficient.

The sophomore took just 

seven shots — only missing a 
single 3-point attempt — to tally 
15 points total. He also grabbed 
six boards.

“That’s what we expect from 

Aubrey every night,” LeVert 
said. “He was on the offensive 
glass, played great defense and 

knocked down a couple shots.”

Dawkins was only bested 

by LeVert, who shot 7-for-12 
from the field and knocked 
down two 3’s for a game-high 
18 points. It was LeVert’s first 
regular-season game since Jan. 
17 when he got injured against 
Northwestern.

Down low, junior forward 

Mark Donnal started at the ‘5,’ 
but played just 10 minutes in 
total. Beilein rotated sophomore 
forward Ricky Doyle and Wilson 
into that role, and 6-foot-10 
freshman Moritz Wagner even 
entered to play the ‘5’ late in 
the second half, burning his 
redshirt. 

Donnal 
started 
in 
the 

exhibition, too, but that likely 
won’t be the case all season. 

“He knows just enough of 

what we’re doing and is just solid 
enough right now,” Beilein said. 
“I would expect that would be a 
competitive spot all year long.”

Michigan’s start was slow, 

but when the rust came off and 
the wheels started turning, the 
Wolverines rolled into another 
century of Michigan basketball.

little rust — 
first game.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Thome scores 21 
to lead Michigan

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

DETROIT 
— 
Opponents 

haven’t found an answer yet for 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team’s 
newest 
center, and 
6-foot-5 
freshman Hallie Thome hopes to 
keep it that way.

Thome and Michigan (2-0) 

fought for their 88-61 win at 
Detroit on Sunday, but it came 
far tougher than first game of 
the weekend. Sophomore guard 
Katelynn Flaherty shouldered 
a four-foul burden most of the 
second half, but Michigan spread 
the wealth, turning to Thome 
down in the paint.

Because Thome towered above 

her shorter opponents — she was 
listed as at least five inches taller 
than every Titan — it was easy for 
the Wolverine guards to feed her 
over the top, where she swiveled 
and finished for six points by the 
end of the opening quarter, and 
10 by halftime.

“Different 
than 
yesterday, 

right?” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “Our guards 
dominated yesterday (against 
Binghamton). It was nice to see 
our bigs get some touches and 
establish an inside presence 
early. It was nice to see (Thome) 
have a great game.”

Added senior guard Madison 

Ristovski: “(Thome) is making 
a positive impact already to the 
defense. She’s got great hands, 
and she can finish really well 
around the rim. She’s someone I 
can throw the ball to and know 
will catch and finish.”

Detroit battled to hold the 

Wolverines’ lead to just three 
through the first quarter, but 
Michigan came out of the huddle 
in the same full-court press that 
shut down Binghamton the day 
before. The Wolverines swung an 
eight-point run in the first three 
minutes to build an 11-point lead, 
and they never looked back.

In that span, four turnovers 

from 
Detroit 
(0-2) 
doomed 

the Titans, who went on to 
give up 30 to Michigan in the 
second quarter. But despite the 
gritty, physical play from guard 
Rosanna Reynolds (19 points, 4 
rebounds, 3 assists) Detroit never 
looked capable of settling in.

Reynolds carried her side, but 

she faced foul trouble as well 
after she accidentally whacked 
Michigan 
freshman 
guard 

Nicole Munger across the mouth 
in the second quarter, giving the 
Wolverines a free basket from 
the line after the dead-ball foul.

The 
freshmen, 
Thome 

included, continued to shine 
as they had in the prior game. 
Late in the first half, guard 
Boogie Brozoski notched two of 
her six assists after the Titans 
continued to turn the ball over 
against the press.

Brozoski and Thome linked 

up much like they did in the 
preseason exhibition when the 
point guard tossed a lob halfway 
down the court out of every 
Titan’s reach to Thome, who laid 
in the basket. Sunday, Thome 
went 9-for-11 shooting with 
21 points, adding three blocks 
and six rebounds to lead the 
Wolverines.

The matchup was also a family 

affair, as Ristovski dueled it 
out against her younger sisters, 
Detroit’s 
Haleigh 
and 
Lola 

Ristovski. Lola, the youngest of 
them all, finished the game with 
nine points, and Haleigh had five 
compared to Madison’s seven.

“I’m very happy Lola played 

well, but I also hit a 3 in her 
face, so I’ll remind her of that 
when she tells me she had 
more points than me,” Madison 
Ristovski said.

Carrying at least a 20-point 

lead most of the second half, 
Michigan 
walked 
out 
of 

Calihan Hall with its second 
consecutive 
win, 
but 
more 

importantly, it obtained even 
more evidence that Thome can 
be as good as advertised.

Niagara falls to Wolverines 

Fast start paces 
Michigan; road 
trip to Boston 

University up next

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan hockey team’s 

previous outing was a rough one, 
a 4-0 loss to Robert Morris at 
Yost Ice Arena on Oct. 31.

Two 

weeks 
passed 
before 
the 

12th-ranked Wolverines (5-1-1) 
finally got the chance to hit the 
ice again to face Niagara.

Motivated to push past its 

first loss of the season, Michigan 
walked away from Yost Ice 
Arena with an emphatic 7-3 
victory over the Purple Eagles 
(0-1-1 Atlantic Hockey League, 
0-5-2 overall).

“It was good to get back into 

a game,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “You try to create 
a game condition and a game 
intensity in practice. Some days 
we’re good, and some days we’re 
not so good. But I thought we 
executed a lot better tonight.

“You’d like to be able to get 

back out there the next week. 
We practiced all week like we 
weren’t playing, and we had to 
ramp it up again this week.”

Within 10 seconds of the 

opening faceoff, junior forward 
JT Compher found himself on a 
breakaway after a nifty faceoff 
play. But Niagara goaltender 
Joe O’Brien was up to the task, 
getting a blocker on Compher’s 
shot and denying Michigan the 
chance to grab the early lead.

“There’s 
more 
and 
more 

faceoff plays in hockey now,” 
Berenson said. “Whether it’s the 
center ice faceoff or an offensive 
zone faceoff, we’re just trying to 
make things happen.”

Niagara 
wasn’t 
so 
lucky 

seven 
minutes 
later 
when 

freshman forward Kyle Connor 
found himself wide open just 
outside the right faceoff circle. 
Connor collected the feed from 

sophomore 
defenseman 
Sam 

Piazza and fired the puck home, 
past O’Brien’s glove to give 
Michigan the 1-0 lead.

From there, the Wolverines 

took it to O’Brien, scoring twice 
in one minute. Senior forward 
Justin Selman redirected a shot, 
and Connor notched his second 
of the game. Connor’s second 
goal was the 
last 
straw, 

and 
O’Brien 

was pulled as 
Michigan went 
into the first 
intermission 
up 3-0.

Even 
with 

a new Niagara 
goaltender 
in net for the second period, 
Michigan didn’t let up.

With just 1:45 gone in the 

second stanza, Michigan’s third 
line got on the board when 
freshman 
forward 
Cooper 

Marody put the Wolverines up 
by four by redirecting a shot to 
beat new goaltender Guillaume 
Therien.

“One of our strengths is that 

we have four lines that can all 
score,” Marody said.

It didn’t get much better 

for Therien in the second as 
Michigan peppered the Niagara 
netminder with shots, breaking 
through again on the power 
play 
when 
junior 
forward 

Tyler Motte tipped a shot from 
Compher for his fifth goal of the 
season.

Niagara got on the board with 

1:49 left in the second period 
with a goal by Tanner Lomsnes, 
but by then, it was a moot point.

In the third period, Michigan 

got 
goals 
from 
sophomore 

forward Tony Calderone and 
sophomore 
defense, 
while 

Niagara 
defenseman 
Niko 

Kovachis and forward Stanislav 
Dzakhov tallied for the Purple 
Eagles.

“We’re fortunate to be able to 

recruit players like Werenski, 
Connor, (senior forward Boo 
Nieves) and Compher,” Berenson 
said. “These guys are all top 
recruits, and they can score. I 
know we can be top offensively. 

We just have to play them with 
the right people and in the right 
role.”

In the Michigan net, senior 

goaltender Steve Racine earned 
the start and excelled, stopping 
21 shots and flashing the leather 
multiple 
times 
throughout 

the game before giving way to 
freshman Chad Catt with 9:52 

left 
in 
the 

game.

“I 
thought 

(Racine) 
played 
well,” 

Werenski said. 
“He made big 
saves for us. 
It’s also good 
to 
start 
3-0 

there in the 

first period to give him some 
confidence.”

With a trip to No. 11 Boston 

University looming in a week, 
it would’ve been easy for the 
Wolverines to look past their 
game against a winless Niagara 
team.

But 
instead, 
Michigan 

buckled down and will head 
to Boston off arguably its best 
game of the season thus far. 

“It’s a one-game weekend, 

there’s nothing to save it for,” 
Berenson said. “We know we 
have a tough opponent next 
week, and we have to get our 
game up to another level. I 
thought we took a step towards 
that tonight.”

He 
did 
not 
flinch 
when 

Michigan trailed by seven points 
and less than three minutes 
remained on the scoreboard. 
Rudock marched the Wolverines 
right down the field.

He did not flinch when six 

seconds remained in the game 
and Michigan had the ball on 
the Hoosiers’ five-yard line on 
fourth down. Rudock threw a 
strike to redshirt junior wide 
receiver Jehu Chesson, who was 
sandwiched by defenders.

He did not flinch in the game’s 

first overtime, when Indiana had 
already scored a touchdown and 
the options were either to score 
a touchdown or kiss his team’s 
Big Ten championship dreams 
goodbye. Rudock threw a 21-yard 
touchdown to Butt on the second 
play of the possession.

And with a chance to win the 

game in the second overtime, 
Rudock 
threw 
a 
25-yard 

touchdown to redshirt junior 
wide receiver Amara Darboh, 
who was wide open.

Hill’s play on the ensuing 

possession sealed the game.

It was a game the Wolverines 

felt they had to win. First, 
there were the obvious stakes: 
If Michigan wins its next two 
games and Ohio State defeats 
Michigan State next weekend, 
the Wolverines will face the 
Buckeyes on Nov. 28 for a berth in 
the Big Ten Championship.

But then, Darboh said after 

the game, there were other 
implications. Before the game, all 
of Michigan’s players scrawled 
the hashtag “#ChadTough” on 
their helmets. The Wolverines 
decided to dedicate the game 
to Chad Carr, the grandson of 
former Michigan coach Lloyd 
Carr. The younger Carr, just 
five years old, is currently in 
hospice care while he battles an 
inoperable brain tumor.

“Any time you dedicate a game 

to someone, you obviously want 
to win,” Darboh said.

At first, the task did not 

seem like it would be a difficult 
one. Indiana (0-6 Big Ten, 4-6 
overall), has enjoyed little success 
in the conference this season. 
The Wolverines (5-1, 8-2) had 
everything on the line.

Michigan came out firing. 

Rudock and Chesson were on the 
same page from the start. They 
connected for three first-half 
touchdown passes, and Michigan 

jumped out to a 21-9 lead in the 
middle of the second quarter. 
Chesson, like Rudock, had a 
career day. He finished with four 
receiving touchdowns and 207 
yards on 10 receptions.

The 
effort 
wasn’t 
enough 

to put away the Hoosiers. The 
Wolverines’ 
defense, 
once 

infallible, 
struggled 
mightily 

at times. Indiana running back 
Jordan Howard rushed for 238 
yards and two touchdowns on 
35 carries. Michigan’s defense 
appeared 
worn 
out 
by 
the 

Hoosiers’ 
up-tempo 
offense. 

Indiana ran play after play 
within seconds of each other, 
rarely slowing down, and took its 
first lead of the game with 7:40 
remaining in the third quarter. 
The Hoosiers did not relinquish 
it until Allen kicked a field goal 
with 6:57 left in the game.

Even then, they gained it right 

back with an eight-play, 69-yard 
touchdown drive.

The Wolverines’ defense felt 

the absence of redshirt junior 
defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow, 
who missed the game with a 
pectoral injury. Harbaugh doesn’t 
expect him back during the 
team’s stretch run. Michigan is 
battered and bruised, but it could 
not be beaten Saturday.

“It’s 
suck-it-up 
time,” 

Harbaugh said.

His team received the message. 

It did not let defensive and special 
team lapses become its undoing. 
Even the offense was stagnant at 
times.

But in the end, after Hill made 

his final play and Rudock finished 
his day, those hiccups proved to 
be nothing more.

Rudock, true to form, didn’t 

emit so much as a grin in his 
postgame 
press 
conference. 

Without the aid of a stat sheet, it 
was unclear whether he threw 
for six touchdown passes or zero. 
Junior cornerback Jourdan Lewis 
reacted in a similar fashion. He 
wasn’t thrilled with how his unit 
played. His demeanor wasn’t one 
emblematic of victory.

Harbaugh, however, allowed 

himself a few grins. He hung 
around the outskirts of Memorial 
Stadium 45 minutes after the 
celebration ended as he waited to 
board the team bus. He stood just 
a few yards away from where Hill 
made the game-ending play.

Children hoarded him for 

autographs, and Michigan fans 
screamed 
his 
catchphrase, 

“Who’s got it better than us?”

The 
answer 
was 
almost 

Indiana. 

senior quarterback Jake Rudock 
lined up on the five-yard line, 
it wasn’t 4th-and-goal. It was 
4th-and-everything.

Rudock threw the ball high 

to redshirt junior receiver Jehu 
Chesson, the man who had 
matched Indiana tit-for-tat all 
game long. As all of Memorial 
Stadium watched with baited 
breath, Chesson came down with 
the ball between two defenders, 
giving Michigan second life. 
There was going to be overtime 
in Bloomington. Right?

Not necessarily. There was 

still an extra point to kick. For 
a team that entered the game 
No. 1 nationally in special teams 
efficiency, that shouldn’t have 
been much concern.

But Michigan had already 

had its heart ripped out on a 
“gimme” special teams play 
against the Spartans. It had 

already given up a punt return 
for a touchdown against the 
Hoosiers, and a low snap earlier 
in the game led to a missed field 
goal. There was no comfort. 
There was only terror.

And indeed, Scott 

Sypniewski’s snap was low. 
Fortunately for Michigan, 
though, Blake O’Neill corralled it 
just time for Kenny Allen to send 
it to overtime.

In the extra period, Indiana 

scored, then Michigan 
countered, then the Wolverines 
struck again. Indiana drove 
right down to the 2-yard line, in 
position to punch it in again and 
continue the agony.

The ball was in Mitchell 

Paige’s hands.

* * *

Delano Hill’s gut told him 

Indiana would run. It was 
only logical, after Howard’s 
domination, that the Hoosiers 
would leave their fate in his 

hands. Instead, they went to the 
air.

In retrospect, the fourth-

down play wouldn’t have even 
happened without Hill, who 
kept Sudfeld out of the end zone 
one play earlier. Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh said he saw 
Sudfeld targeting the matchup 
on Hill as the play developed. 
Hill didn’t know they would 
throw at him.

It’s fitting that the play that 

could have cost Michigan its 
season came down to instinct. 
Instinct is fickle and, of course, 
chaotic. After all, O’Neill was just 
following instinct when he tried 
to punt the ball after fumbling it 
against the Spartans, and it cost 
him dearly.

But when Hill reached into 

Paige’s hands and plucked out 
the ball, his aggression paid off. 
Like O’Neill, he didn’t have time 
to hesitate. He saw the ball was 
coming, and he had to get it out. 
His instincts came through. The 
season lived.

* * *

When the press conferences 

ended and the field cleared out, 
a large group of fans waited 
just behind the end zone where 
Hill made his stand. Harbaugh 
came out, and kids and parents 
alike clamored for pictures and 
autographs. Harbaugh met them 
along a fence, trying to appease 
them until it was clear he 
couldn’t possibly get to them all.

They shouted to him, with 

their hopes still high, as 
Harbaugh walked away. He had a 
bus to catch.

Soon, across the stadium, the 

buses were exiting the parking 
lot, honking continuously in 
celebration. Their cargo was on 
its way back to Ann Arbor with 
a game to prepare for next week 
at Penn State.

Somehow, it still matters.

Five things we learned from Saturday

Rudock playing 

bigger than ever, but 
Glasgow’s absence 
could prove costly

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Very little went as expected 

for the Michigan football team 
Saturday. 
The 
14th-ranked 

Wolverines won, beating Indiana 
48-41 in double-overtime, but 
the game played out in dissimilar 
fashion than most have this 
season.

The defense, previously the 

best in the country, gave up a 
season-high 41 points, while 
fifth-year 
senior 
quarterback 

Jake Rudock set a school record 
with six touchdown passes to 
go along with 504 total yards of 
offense.

Though Michigan won as 

expected, there were plenty 
of lessons learned about the 
Wolverines. The Daily breaks 
down five things we learned 
from Saturday.

1. Ryan Glasgow’s absence 
is a big loss — literally and 
figuratively.

By the time redshirt junior 

defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow 
left midway through Michigan’s 
49-16 
win 
over 
Rutgers 
a 

weekend ago, the Scarlet Knights 
were too far behind to capitalize.

But with a week to prepare, 

the Hoosiers saw the hole the 
6-foot-7, 297-pound lineman’s 
absence created. Indiana rushed 
for 307 yards Saturday — more 
than 
doubling 
the 
previous 

high of 144 yards allowed by 
Michigan’s defense.

Running 
back 
Jordan 

Howard ran for 248 yards and 
two touchdowns. The previous 
best individual rushing output 
against the Wolverines was just 

81 yards.

Things grew worse after the 

game, however, when Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh announced 
that Glasgow would likely be out 
for the season with a pectoral 
injury.

Players and coaches reiterated 

all week that the rotation-heavy 
defensive front was deep enough 
to survive, but the results in the 
game showed otherwise.

“It looked like we were playing 

like we were undermanned. 
We were tired,” Harbaugh said. 
“We’re just going to have to 
suck it up. ... There’s nothing in 
football you hate to see more 
than when a team goes on a long 
drive and only runs the football. 
That was all they did.”

2. Jake Rudock can carry the 

Wolverines.

Things looked much brighter 

on the other side of the ball, as 
Rudock had a career day. The 
504 yards of offense and six 
touchdowns will stay in the 
record books, but it was his 
leadership that allowed him to 
lead the Wolverines on a last-
minute drive to tie the game with 
two seconds left, which means 
more in the present.

“He is unflappable,” Harbaugh 

said. “He just does not flinch, 
does 
not 
matter 
what 
the 

situation is. He talks, he gives 
feedback, he’s exactly the same 
all the time. He’s got ice water in 
his veins.”

Aside from a few setbacks, 

Rudock has gotten better as the 
season progresses, throwing for 

777 yards and eight touchdowns 
in the last two weeks. Because 
Rudock was unable to work with 
the Michigan coaching staff 
or the full team until August, 
there’s a chance he’s just now 
hitting his stride.

If that’s the case, Michigan’s 

upcoming 
matchups 
against 

Penn 
State 
(7-3) 
and 
Ohio 

State (10-0) seem much more 
manageable.

3. Facing Ohio State at 9-2 is 
far from inevitable.

Though the matchups can 

be manageable if Rudock plays 
otherworldly, 
the 
odds 
of 

that happening are very slim. 
Rutgers (119th in the nation 
in passing yards allowed) and 
Indiana (127th) have the worst 

pass defenses in the Big Ten 
by a wide margin, while Penn 
State (second) and Ohio State 
(seventh) are not only among the 
conference’s best, but also the 
nation’s.

After Michigan’s blowout win 

over Rutgers, many had begun 
to assume that the Wolverines 
would blow past the Hoosiers 
and Nittany Lions to enter the 
Nov. 28 matchup against the 
Buckeyes with a shot at the Big 
Ten East title.

But 
after 
showing 
major 

defensive holes and failing to 
receive 
production 
from 
its 

running backs (82 yards on 21 
carries), it has become clear 
that Michigan is far from the 
unrelenting force many thought 
it was earlier in the season.

Instead, the Wolverines have 

become a team susceptible to 
upsets 
and 
underwhelming 

performances.

4. Michigan has recovered 
from its late-game woes.

For much of the past three 

seasons, Michigan has struggled 
mightily in close-yet-winnable 
games. Whether it was blowing 
late 
leads, 
comebacks 
that 

fell just short or catastrophic 
fumbled punts, the Wolverines 
have had difficulty walking away 
with wins when they should.

But in its last two close 

games, Michigan has stood tall. 
Against Minnesota, a goal-line 
stand put an end to a wild win 
after the team nearly blew a 
lead. And against Indiana, the 
Wolverines regained a lead they 
had previously blown.

Part of the change can be 

attributed to an older and wiser 
team than in past years, but 
much of it is simply learning 
how to win close games. Even 
in an uncharacteristically bad 
game for the defense and an 
exhausting day for the offense, 
Michigan was able to close it 
out.

“Our guys found a way to 

win,” Harbaugh said. “As good a 
win as you’ll ever have.”

5. BOLD PREDICTION: Jehu 
Chesson wins the team MVP.

Despite a quiet start to the 

season (190 yards and zero 
touchdowns receiving in his first 
seven games), the redshirt junior 
wide receiver has exploded on 
the scene, racking up 276 yards 
and seven touchdowns in his last 
three games.

More importantly, Chesson 

emerged Saturday as Rudock’s 
top 
target. 
With 
Michigan 

leaning more on the passing game 
in recent weeks, look for Chesson 
to run away with not only more 
touchdowns, but the title as the 
Wolverines’ best player.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Michigan’s defensive line will have a major void to fill with redshirt junior Ryan Glasgow out for the season with a pectoral injury.
