Wolverines poised for tough Sweet 16 matchup

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
For the Michigan women's tennis
team, playing No. 7 UCLA in the
Sweet 16 this weekend is like any
other day at the office.
Playing the likes of Big Ten foes
No. 11 Northwestern and No. 16
Nebraska is no easy task each year.
But these grueling matches are
the ones that prepare teams for
the big stage. So the 10th-ranked
Wolverines are ready for the
Bruins this weekend, regardless of
the ranking.
"We played a strong schedule, so
it's nothing we're not used to and
we match up well," said Michigan
c6ach Ronni Bernstein. "They are a
very good team, but if we come out
strong and get the doubles point, I
think we have a good shot."
The Wolverines earned their
spot in the Sweet 16 after blanking
both IPFW and Notre Dame, 4-0, in
the Ann Arbor Regional.
But Michigan (10-1 Big Ten, 23-5
overall) will be challenged a UCLA

has been the cornerstone to each fusion of opposite playing styles to
doubles point victory and attribute take down opponents. Rounding

out Michigan's lineup is freshman
Ronit Yurovsky and sophomore
Kristen Dodge, who both bring a
great energy to the court.
Even with a strong lineup, the
Wolverines will be battle tested by
the Bruins, who have three ranked
doubles pairs.
"We just have to go out with good
energy in the doubles and get that
point," Bernsteinsaid.
Winning the doubles point is
even more important for Michigan,
as the Bruins boast five ranked
players - including two in the Top
20.
The Wolverines' top player,
No. 30 Bektas, will face the third-
ranked player, Robin Anderson.
"The biggest thing is that I am
going to have to fight and compete,"
Bektas said. "I know that she's a
great player, but as long as I'm fight-
ing, Iwill have a great chance. If she
starts pushing me back during the
match, I'm going to be in trouble."
The Bruins' star-studded roster
doesn't end there. Yurovsky, who
plays in the second spot, will face

No. 20 Kyle McPhillips, who is the
highest ranked opponent she has
faced in a dual-match season. But
Bernstein didn't seem worried.
"(Yurovsky) is experienced from
the juniors," she said. "She plays
with such an aggressive style, and
that definitely translates to her suc-
cess playing higher in the lineup."
Luckily for the Wolverines, they
have one of the most decorated
coaching staffs in the country.
Bernstein recently picked up her
fourth Big Ten Coach of the Year
award, while assistant coach Teryn
Ashley-Fitch was awarded the ITA
Midwest Assistant Coach of the
Year award.
"Teryn is incredible," Bektas
said. "It's her personality and how
she is on the court. I always love
when she is on my court and comes
over and helps me. She has a really
calming presence and always tells
you what you want to hear."
With good coaching, Michigan
will certainly be ready for the chal-
lenge of UCLA. It will be a battle
won by the team who wants it more.

CFPB report details
effects of $1.1
trillion in loans
By KATIE BURKE
Editor in Chief
The ever-increasing national
student loan debt is raising
red flags as the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau
released a report on student loan
affordability last week.
The report was the result of
28,000 comments submitted from
public colleges and universities,
professional associations, housing
finance experts, students and
families solicited from a Request
for Information Regarding an
Initiative to Promote Student
Loan Affordability in February.
"Today's report warns of the
potential domino effects on the

economy of high student debt,"
CFPB director Richard Cordray
said in a press release.
According to the report, over
38 million student loan borrowers
are holding more than $1.1 tril-
lion in debt, with over $8 billion
in defaulted private student loan
balances as of the end of 2011.
The report listed some of the
problems occurring as a result
of unpaid student debt for recent
graduates, including decreased
homeownership, less confidence
in starting up small businesses,
increased retirement insecurity
and primary healthcare shortage.
U.S. Secretary of Education
Arne Duncan said in a press
release that the report is a step
toward confronting and ultimately
addressing the various issues that
arise from accumulating debt.
"While federal loans remain a
student's best option, the CFPB's
important work highlights that

many students are struggling to
repay debt from private lenders,
identifies obstacles that hinder
lenders from providing borrow-
ers with more options to better
manage their debt, and provides
thoughtful options for address-
ing these challenges that deserve
policymakers' serious consider-
ation," Duncan said in the release.
University professors are active
participants in the discussionon the
potential crisis that growing debt
could cause, as well as the nuances
between public and private loans.
Donald Grimes, senior
research specialist and economist
at the University's Institute for
Research for Labor, Employment
and the Economy, said federal
review should be focusing on pub-
lic rather than private loans.
"That's where the big money is,
that's where the big debt is, some-
thing like 90 percent of the total

site marks
progress
for CTE
Web page
provides info for
undocumented
applicants
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
ManagingNews Editor
After a year of protests and
rallies, the Coalition for Tuition
Equality, a student organization
that advocates for the in-state
tuition rate for undocumented
students who have lived in
Michigan, has made another
tangible mark of progress: a web
page on the University's Office of
Financial Aid website that offers
information to prospective and
current undocumented students.
The site, launched earlier this
month, was developed, in part,
based on a recommendation from
a report developed by a joint
task force of students which was
presented to the University's Board
of Regents in March.
University Spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the site was
developed because of the number
of inquiries from prospective
undocumented students.
"Quite frankly we realized that
we didn't have this information
specifically for those students and
those who helped those students
apply for college on our website,"
Fitzgerald said.

SPH opens Center for Cancer Biostatistics e emnsa

Reeling 'M' needs improvement


New facility to bring
together graduate
and undergrad work
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily Staff Reporter
As cancer research increases
in complexity, interdisciplinary
research methodologies are
becoming more important in
extracting viable results. As
a result, the School of Public
Health, in collaboration with the
Comprehensive Cancer Center, will
establish a new Center for Cancer
Biostatistics within its departments.
Unlike the current research
conducted through the two
institutions, the new center will
involve advanced statistical
methods and technologies to
PROGRESS
From Page 1
The site provides resources to
undocumented students by offering
contacts within the Office of
Admissions and Office of Financial
Aid and directingstudents to outside
groups - such as the National
Immigration Law Center - that
can support their application to and
enrollment in the University.
While the site encourages the
application of undocumented
immigrants, it acknowledges that
the University does not offer any
specific financial aid programs to
these applicants.
Undocumented students are not

improve the quality of results.
InApril,the Public HealthSchool
announced in a press release that
Biostatistics prof Jeremy Taylor
will head the center.
Taylor said the new center will be
focused on statistical methods and
will bring more complexity to the
existing research methodologies of
the school.
"It's sort of a stimulus to get to a
higher level from what we largely do
already," Taylor said. "Now we have
more to offer interms of intellectual
power, focus and organization
ability."
Biostatistics prof Trivellore Rag-
hunathan said, given an increasing
volume of available cancer-related
data, a "cutting-edge method to pro-
cess these data and predict the can-
cer-related outcomes" was required.
Though the center will be
housed within the Public Health
Federal Student Aid without a social
security number and are therefore
ineligible for federal financial aid
and centrally awarded University
financial aid.
Fitzgerald said the University
acknowledged the difficulty of
clearing this financial hurdle for
undocumented students.
"There are other private
scholarships, some scholarships
in individual schools and colleges
that don't require the use of the
FASFA form but... most financial aid
requires FAFSA," he said. "That is a
tough burden to overcome."
Fitzgerald added that the process
of applying to the University and
receiving financial aid were two
separate processes. Application
to the University does not require

School, Raghunathan said the pool
of resources utilized by the center
will be a joint enterprise between
University departments.
He stressed that while various
University schools and colleges
served as effective "administrative
boundaries," there is no reason why
research should be confined within
those boundaries.
"We need to comprehensively
think about the methods that are
needed to process all of these large
amount of data," Raghunathan said.
"We thought that bringing all the
faculty and staff together under one
roof would facilitate much more
collaboration."
Raghunathan said analyzing data
from sources such as the federal Cen-
ters for Medicaid and Medicare Ser-
vices, survey research and statistical
trials requires a greater collaboration
of resources than currently exist.
proof of citizenship while receiving
financial aid does.
University alum Kevin Mersol-
Barg, one of the founders of CTE,
said while he is appreciative of the
website, more needs to be done.
"CTE is really happy to see that
the University has taken the first
step to provide a more welcoming
environment for undocumented
students and prospective
undocumented students," Mersol-
Bargsaid. "However we believe that
the University has much more work
to do in terms of increasing access
for undocumented students."
Mersol-Barg added that CTE
appreciated that, on the site, the
University was forthright about
the "grave financial hurdles" that
undocumented students face.

In June, faculty from the center
will begin their migration into
the new facility in the School of
Public Health. However, Taylor
said extensive planning and
coordination is yet to be done.
"(The center is) openbut we don't
really have a game plan of what we
wantto achieve," Taylor explained.
Raghunathan said students stand
to benefit from the center because of
the opportunity for research grants
and concentrated resource pools.
The Public Health School pri-
marily houses graduate programs,
but Raghunathan said an expansion
to undergraduate students is a pos-
sibility through the Undergraduate
Research Opportunity Program.
"By bringing everybody into
one building we think that we can
exploit the strength of all these
individual groups and enhance the
research," he said.
He said he has so far been
disappointed with the outcome of
the task force report.
"There has been an utter lack of
transparency in terms of progress
that has been made in terms of their
deliberations and what we can expect
in terms of timeline and where the
University will ultimately stand on
the issue," Mersol-Bergsaid.
In the meantime, Mersol-Berg
said CTE will continue to be active
in protests, including a presence at
the May 16th regents meeting, and
will find it "utterly unacceptable if
progress has not been made come
September."
Fitzgerald said the website does
not represent a shift in University
policy regardingtuition equality. He
said any shift in policy would come
after University President Mary Sue
Coleman and other top administra-
tors reviewed the task force report
submitted to the regents in March.
"There has been no change in
our policy at this point but certainly
folks at the highest levels of the
University administration have
been looking very carefully at that
task force report," he said. "(We are)
trying to determine what the next
step for the University might be."
Fitzgerald said the University
would continue work on the issue
over the summer.
"It is a complicated problem that
we are looking very closely at and
that is what we will continueto work
on," Fitzgerald said. "Everybody
expects that they will be moving
ahead as quickly as they possibly
can."

The Michigan softball team
blazed through regular-season
conference play, garnering a 20-2
record and earning a sixth-straight
Big Ten championship. But when
the postseason began, the Wolver-
ines experienced a harsh reality: It's
a whole new
ballgame. ALEJANDRO
In the post- ZUNIGA
season, every
mistake is On Softball
amplified. In
the postseason, every team plays
with a chip on its shoulder. And in
the postseason, a tournament run
can end after one bad inning.
The postseason isn't for just
anyone. Only the best succeed.
But Michigan - by far the
league's best offense - looked
downright ordinary during the Big
Ten Tournament in Lincoln, Neb.
last weekend. After they terrorized
Ohio State to the tune of 33 runs in
three games in early April, the Wol-
verines squeaked by the Buckeyes,
3-2, in the conference quarterfinals.
The following afternoon,
Michigan managed to plate just
three runners as it was blasted by
Wisconsin, 9-3. The Wolverines
had also lost their first series of the
season just two weekends before
against Nebraska.
Now, they have to regroup and
take care of business at home in
the NCAA Regional against new
opponents if they want their season
to continue. Fortunately for the No.
8 seed, Michigan is a perfect 16-0 at
home.
But maybe the Wolverines have
lost some of their edge after facing
nine ranked opponents before their
Big Ten slate. Michigan entered
April as the only conference team in
the Top 25 and didn't play another
ranked foe until April 26-28 at
Nebraska. The Wolverines were
then eliminated from the Big Ten
Tournament by No. 24 Wisconsin,
dropping Michigan's record against
ranked opponents to 1-3 since
league competition began.
After terrorizing pitchers all sea-
son, Big Ten Freshman and Player
of the Year Sierra Romero might
take a lot of the blame for the Wol-
verines' recent struggles. The Mur-
rieta, Calif. native's 32-game streak
of reaching base was snapped when
she went 0-for-4 against Ohio State
in the conference quarterfinals,
and she followed with an identical
line against the Badgers the follow-
ing afternoon. Romero also went
0-for-7 in the regular-season series

against Nebraska when she failed
to deliver in pressure situations, a
facet of her game where she had no
previous issues.
But don't point to the freshman
as the only reason for Michigan's
sudden return to mortality.
Haylie Wagner, last season's Big
Ten Pitcher and Freshman of the
Year, returned from an apparent
back injury 19 games into the
season and couldn't reproduce the
same dominance as in 2012. The
sophomore allows a full run per
seven innings more than she did
last year, while batters average over
30 points better - and Wagner has
pitched 20 fewer complete games
(albeit in 14 fewer games started).
Even after Wagner's return from
injury, sophomore Sara Driesenga
has taken the bulk of the workload
in the circle and delivered. The
right-handed ace boasts a 26-6
record with a 1.81 earned-run
average and has better than a

3-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio. But
Driesenga's production in the box
has dipped sharply, and she bats
.275 after hitting .340 last season.
Behind the pitchers, Michigan's
defense has been a source of
frustration. The Wolverines' .958
fielding percentage is in the bottom
half of the Big Ten, and their 66
errors are worse than all but two
teams in the conference.
In the postseason, those perfor-
mances aren't enough to contend.
But led by veteran coach Carol
Hutchins, star-studded Michigan
has the tools and experience neces-
sary to make a deep postseason run.
They have home-field advantage if
they advance to the Super Region-
als, where a three-game series will
determine a berth in the Women's
College World Series. But that's a
big "if," and the Wolverines have to
put all of those tools together quick-
ly in order to challenge for the pro-
gram's second national title.

(debt) is in federal loans," Grimes
said.
The role of private banks in
student loans was diminished
with the Federal Direct Loan
Program, instituted in 2010,
which offers the largest source of

college financial assistance in the
country through its programs.
However, while the majority of
students receive loans through
public sources, the CFPB report
cites that 81 percent of borrowers
graduating with $40,000 or more
in debt had private loans.
According to the University's
financial aid website, providers
such as PNC Bank, Wells Fargo
and Sallie Mae granted 10 or

more loans to University students
in the 2011-2012 year.
For students who have
completed a Free Application for
Federal Student Aid, federal loans
are awarded based on need, while
private loans require separate
applications and are more
dependent on credit, usually that
of a co-signer or parent.
Grimes added that the govern-
ment should avoid an interest rate

increase - a hotly contested issue
in Congress right now, as the
interest rate on federal student
loans are scheduled to double
from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent
on July 1 -and should be aware
of the overhang of the amount
of debt on students and consider
restructuring the way in which
they decide who to grant loans to.
Under the currentsystem, some
borrowers are eligible to receive

more loans than they can realisti-
cally afford to pay back. In 2008,
10 percent of private student loan
recipients devoted more than 25
percent of their income to meet
student loan repayment obliga-
tions, a figure which, according
to the CFPB report, is presumed
to have grown in recent years.
Grimes said the issue of
student debt requires quick
action by Congress and should be
addressed simultaneously with
the management of interest rate
levels.
"That would be a good vehicle
to sort of move this whole discus-
sion forward about the student
loan debt, what the appropriate
role is, how much of a burden stu-
dents should be expected to bear
and what sort of risk tolerance
the government should bear over
the longer term," he said.
The CFPB report calls for
affordable restructuring of loans,
borrower transparency, loss-
sharing for loan defaults and
repair of a borrower's credit pro-
file in cases of default.
While the report acknowledges
the variety of obstacles in the way
of creating an affordable student
loan system, it aims to "help
policymakers as they consider the
best ways to facilitate the viability
and economic participation of
consumers facing heavy student
debt burdens."
Grimes said student debt
will continue to be a major
national issue until a sustainable,
reasonable solution is set in place.
"Right now, we've got an open-
ended spigot in terms of grant-
ing these loans, both in terms of
the colleges and universities that
qualify and the amount of money
that's going to these students."

Redeveloping Detroit
Balancing the books is just the beginning
n Monday, Kevyn Orr, emergency financial manager for
the city of Detroit, released his 45 day report assessing the
city's finances along with a list of suggestions to help the
city find solvency. Unsurprisingly, Orr found massive flaws in the city's
management of funds and services. His report indicates that he is
prepared to take serious action in pursuit of Detroit's long term fiscal
solvency, suggesting major restructuring of police, fire and public
transportation, the privatization of public lighting services and the
possibility of cutting pensions for retired city employees. Orr is taking
necessary action to help the city begin its long road to financial recovery,
but his efforts as emergency manager can only affect the city's bottom
line. In order for Detroit to make a true recovery, the state must realize
that short-term fiscal solvency won't necessarily lead to the growth and
stability that the city needs.

Middle school was awful. Those three
years of my existence were filled with
awkwardness and self-pity that, looking
back, makes me cringe. Teenage acne, braces,
glasses and struggling with my weight
- I was the stereotypical middle school
"outcast". Fitting in wasn't easy - the best I
could do was try to blend into the background
and avoid unwanted attention. But kids were
cruel. The popular girls and boys preyed upon
whomever they thought was a "loser" by
checking if you had the stamps of approval -
Abercrombie, Hollister or Aeropostale.
Before the recent controversy over
Abercrombie and Fitch, I knew there was
something sinister about the brand - stout
eight grade Megan knew something was
amiss about their sizes. I remember shopping
for school clothes with my mom and begging
to go shopping at Abercrombie. However,
nothing ever fit quite right. I could feel my
self-confidence withering away as I tried to
squeeze into a pair of jeans. Abercrombie
- with all its beautiful, toned models and
tailored clothes - subtlety relayed the
brutal Mean Girls message that I wasn't
"cool enough" to wear their clothes. I
shouldn't have been ashamed that I couldn't
fit into their generic, branded clothing.
But try telling that to a young girl trying so
desperately to fit in. Eventually, I came to the
realization that it's not the label on the pants


ig Fitch

University of Michigan Ck

that defines you.
Over the last week, a 2006 Salon interview
with Mike Jeffries, the CEO of Abercrombie
& Fitch, went viral. The interview features
Jeffries addressing the very thoughts I
had as a pudgy middle schooler with a few
friends. "In every school there are the cool
and popular kids, and then there are the not-
so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool
kids ... A lot of people don't belong (in our
clothes), and they can't belong." It may seem
silly now, but back then wearing a moose or
seagull emblem was a way to simply fit in, to
gain friends in a hostile environment. Was
because I couldn't fit into a specific brand
of t-shirt or jeans a reason I wasn't worthy
enough to belong?
Personally, I've stayed away from any
clothing from Abercrombie and the like, but
calling for a boycott of one clothing company
is only a quick fix. While the reactions to
Jeffries' interview have certainly hurt his
company, the interview provides insight to
the warped view of Americans when it comes
to body image and self-worth. According to
the National Eating Disorders Association,
20 million women and 10 million men have
an eating disorder at some time in their
life. Companies like Abercrombie and Fitch
have made a fortune off of depleting self-
worth - the dieting industry is worth $40
billion dollars a year. Since it's deplorable to
think that others are
getting rich off of
ass of2013 others' insecurities,
we have to address
the core of the
problem - why do
these insecurities
exist and what can
we do to get rid of
them?
I'm not arguing
that one shouldn't
strive to improve
one's health, but the
motivation to lose
weight or eat health-
ier foods shouldn't
come from a Botox-
infused CEO. I've
learned that self-
worth isn't attached
Ross to your pant, dress or
shirt size. That's the
message we should

)uder. middle schoolers and
everyone else who
struggles with their
body images. It's

make-up or shoes,
but the person with-

ANNOUNCEMENT
I, SOMESH RAHUL, holder of In-
dian Passport number 16879359, issued
at Lucknow, penmanent resident of Luc-
know, India, and presently residing at
Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA do hereby
change my name from (Given name)

Given Orr's track record
in handling bankruptcies,
there's no doubt he can
put the city's finances in
order again. However, a
number of his suggestions
for saving money could be
potentially disastrous to
thousands of Detroit resi-
dents, harming economic
recovery in the name of
fiscal responsibility. Cut-
ting pensions to retirees
is a perfect example - the
city's pension funds are
certainly a mess financial-
ly - but the sheer number
of people who would be
hurt by this measure could
very well end up doing
more harm than good. The
same goes for the restruc-
turing of public services
like lighting, transporta-
tion and police.
Kevyn Orr's very

position as emergency
manager is the topic of
much debate. However,
whether or not the job Orr
holds is legitimate is not
at issue here - the state
appointed him and he is
doing his job, regardless of
who agreed or disagreed
with his appointment.
Moreover, the state has a
role to play in the city of
Detroit's restructuring
and management even
after Orr's term has
expired. The city simply
doesn't have the resources
to function without some
kind of external aid. In the
future, the state must take
an active role in promoting
regional partnerships and
subsidize projects that
will improve Detroit, and
by extension the entire
state of Michigan.

Earlier this year, the
Detroit Works Project pre-
sented a long term mas-
ter plan called the Detroit
Future City Strategic
Framework. This plan
includes major changes
in how city services are
structured in order to save
money and make serious
improvements to public
safety, transportation and
blight. Though this plan
certainly has its flaws, and
many groups in the city dis-
agree with its principles, it's
an idea that could radically
improve the city's image
and the lives of residents.
Along with its attention to
fiscal solvency, the state
must promote and develop
ideas like the Future City
plan in order to truly grow
Detroit and prepare the city
for the future.

Motion ofthe ocean

Is the glass half-full, or half-empty?
All our lives we're haunted with these
perspectival questions that determine
what we can be clas-
sified as: pessimists or
optimists, realists or ide-
alists. These questions
can become especially
prevalent at this time of '
year - finals-are over, it's
the cusp of summer and
we're packing every item PAIGE
we own into boxes, stuff-PFLEGER
ing pillow cases full of _______
socks and the teddy bear
we don't want to admit
we brought to college, and garbage bags with
empty alcohol bottles and notes that we took
so painstakingly in class but are rendered
useless now. It's hard to see ourselves boiled
down to a minivan-trunk-full of boxes and
feel any kind of uplifting optimism, and we
find ourselves asking - is this an ending or is
it another beginning?
Like as the waves make towards the
pebbled shore,
So do our minutes hasten to their end;
Each changing place with that which goes
before,
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
-William Shakespeare, Sonnet LX
Is this an ending
or is it another
beginning?
The entire idea of an ending has a certain
inevitability that is hard to escape. All things
must end, our childhood ends when we go off
to college, get our first real job and enter the
real world, exploding outwards like we've just
been thrown from a violently revolving door
and are expected to keep up. As Shakespeare
describes, even something as seemingly end-
less as the ocean experiences an ending when
its waves break on the shore, and we're pretty
minuscule in comparison to all that water.
There are many kinds of endings, my per-
sonal favorite being the ever-elusive "happy
ending". The entire concept of a happy ending
seems to be a paradox in and of itself - if it's
FOLLOW DAI
Keep up with columnists, rea
the deb

so happy, it wouldn't end, would it? Wouldn't
I remain infinitely happy forever? I guess if
the Twilight saga has taught us anything it's
that infinity only creates tortured souls, but
it seems to me that a happy ending is indica-
tive of just that - happiness ending. Prince
Charming and the Princess may get married at
the end of the movie, but I'll bet their marriage
isn't all they thought it was cracked up to be.
Then you have the endings that leave you
wanting more, like the feeling you get after
turning the very last page of a good book -
you have a feeling of accomplishment and yet
a small, bothersome yearning has taken root
in your brain like a seedling, and it needs to
be fed more of the story. This is the ending
we can best deal with as humans - it's in our
nature to constantly want more, so it's easy to
suppress this yearning and continue on.
Then comes the kind of ending that we are
most familiar with - the endingthat shatters
your well-being in a way that makes you feel
like it is just that - The End. The end of a
relationship can plunge us in a downward
spiral of unhappiness - and when it comes to
this kind of ending, how can we find any sort
of positive spin? How can we see a beginning
when the most obvious aspect of our lives is
this ending?
The wave that breaks on the shore doesn't
just dissipate into nothing. It collects itself and
rolls back out to sea to become something new,
to begin a new wave that could be even better
thanthe last. There's somethingexcitingabout
an ending that's sometimes difficult to think of
when we are faced with it, and this excitement
is always there - just looming with potential.
Shakespeare reminds us that everything
continues onward, that our lives are full of
this amazing forward motion. In the case of
an endingthis constant forward motion of the
waves to the shore can be harnessed and used
to our advantage. You're moving back home
for the summer? Set goals, reinvent yourself,
take the time to do things you are passion-
ate about and don't dwell on the fact that you
are leaving the beautiful Ann Arbor or living
under your parent's roof. You're experienc-
ing a bad break up? Clearly that person wasn't
right for you, so don't fight it, go with the flow
and see how it carries you to new opportu-
nities. It's important to remember that with
every ending comes a new beginning, and the
only place to go is forward.

The government gives us plenty
of reasons to complain - see the
113th Congress. Taxes are high,
there aren't enough
jobs and at the rate
tuition is rising, our
debts are going to
take lifetimes to pay
off. The future looks
bright, right?
Yet, if there's one
thing that can be DEREK
agreed upon, it's that WOLFE
our most basic rights
are rarely infringed
upon. Sure, the gun
control and abortion debates loom, but
for the most part, we can do what we
want when we want. In many respects, it
wouldn't be far off to say that many of us
take our freedom for granted - myself
included.
This year - for the first time - I started
to consider the privilege of living under
these circumstances. My roommate, Josh,
was from Korea - yes, he knew who Psy
was before Gangnam Style - and he had
been trying to decide whether to return
to the University in the fall or embark on
his mandatory two-year military service
and return in 2015. Also, two of my friends
decided to voluntarily serve in the Israel
Defense Forces instead of coming to school
in the U.S.
As an outsider to the idea of mandatory
military service - also known as conscrip-
tion - the thought of delaying my edu-
cation and potentially being deployed is
frightening. By no means am I emotionally
stable enough to live thousands of miles
away from my friends and family. Heck,
that's why I chose a school 45 minutes
from my house.
But Josh sees it differently. "I never real-
ly thought about (serving) because if you're
born in Korea as aguy, you have to do it," he
told me in a conversation before leaving. "I
knew (I had to serve) since I was a young
kid, so it didn't really affect my life."
It also became evident while talking
to him how much of a culture difference
existsbetween countries that have manda-
tory service and those that don't. "When I
lived in Korea, I never realized it was such
a big deal. But when I came here and talked
to people about it, they freaked out."
Why is it that most Americans fear serv-
ing in the military and that even though
the U.S. was engaged in two wars for over a

decade, the idea is still so foreign to them?
According to a study by Pew Research,
only half of a percent of the U.S. popula-
tion has served since the beginning of the
Afghanistan war. This has contributed to
an increasingly growing military-civilian
gap with discrepancies between how the
general public and veterans view today's
societal issues. Because so few people
know others who have served, the experi-
ence is unimaginable.
In February, Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-
NY) introduced a bill that would require
Many of us take
our freedom for
granted.
mandatory military service for all Ameri-
cans. I've always joked with my familythat
if this were ever to happen, I would run
away to Canada since the military is some-
thing I definitely don't want to deal with
especially during my college years.
However, Josh gave me a new perspec-
tive on how meaningful serving in the mil-
itary can be - likening the experience to
taking a gap year that many students take
before undergraduate or graduate school.
"I kind of want to go (to the military)
because I think I need a break from study-
ing and academics. I think it would be a
good opportunity to reflect on my life."
Right now, it appears that Americans
have nothing to fear in regards to a draft.
With the two wars seemingly winding
down, there shouldn't be a need for more
troops. Nonetheless, the conversations
I've had recently with Josh and others
have made me reconsider the value of the
brave men and women who do choose to
serve in the military. Their service has
allowed me to be free without worrying
about being free.
As more veterans return home in the
near future, I've come to realize it's our
duty to acclimate them back into normal
civilian life. Considering the time and
energy they spent serving, it's the least we
can do.

New 'Gatsby'
stays faithful

Luhrmann's latest
film succeeds with
arresting visuals
By BRIAN BURLAGE
Daily Arts Writer
In the decade of jazz, at the con-
clusion of the First World War,
when booze was as inexhaustible as
money, America
roared into sud-
den primacy as all
the major world The Great
powers tilted off
their axes. There GatsbY
upon the world At Quality16
stage, all light and and Rave
warm sensibility
beaming down, Warner Bros
the lone figure of
the United States danced and jigged
in celebration.
Baz Luhrmann's "The Great
Gatsby" - based on the novel by F.
Scott Fitzgerald - mirrors the tri-
umphant, if not over-the-top, grace
of America in the roaring '20s. As
the narrator Nick Carraway (Tobey
Maguire, "Spiderman") describes,
"the parties were bigger, the cit-
ies were taller and the liquor was
cheaper." More could be enjoyed at
less expense. Extravagance was just
a way of life. Luhrmann succeeds
in delivering a colorful, explosive
retelling of American grandeur in
the 1920s.
But not all American hearts sang
in jubilation. Jay Gatsby (Leon-
ardo DiCaprio, "Inception") is an
enormously wealthy, mysterious
resident of West Egg. Carraway,
who moves into the ramshackle
house next door, gradually makes
his acquaintance and learns of the
tragic love affair between Gatsby
and Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mul-
ligan, "Drive"), who is Carraway's
cousin. Though Daisy is married
to Tom (Joel Edgerton, "Zero Dark
Thirty") and lives in old-money
East Egg across the bay, Gatsby is
determined to recreate the love
they shared before he went to war.
Every night he wanders to the end
of his dock, stretches out his arms
in undaunted hope and reaches
toward the green light emanating
from Daisy's dock across the water.

Luhrmann's "Gatsby" explores
the darker nature of the times -
the rivalries between old and new
money,theever-expandingdiscrep-
ancy between rich and poor, the
tumultuous and corrosive bonds of
love among the wealthy - and also
of Jay Gatsby himself. Captivatedby
his undying hope to regain Daisy's
love, Gatsby is driven to corruption,
greed and, in the midst of a whirl-
wind affair, even madness.
But with the costumes, set
designs, acting and with Jay-Z's
modern score, the film certainly
pushes the boundaries of extrava-
gance. Jewels bedazzle each shot;
each character's appearance is
almost too vibrant and pristine
and the first third of the movie is
seemingly dedicated to revealing
the extent of the filmmaker's party-
coordinating skill. In fact, when
Carraway reflects on his partying
experience, he feels it necessary to
ask "What's it all for?" as though
the point of the excess is to have no
point at all.
For all the film's shortcomings,
however, credit must be given to
Luhrmann, who does a phenom-
enal job of aligning the script with
the original text. The film begins
and ends with the green light - the
symbolic turning away of old for-
tunes and past loves. Added empha-
sis is placed on Gatsby's origin, as he
embodies the ideal of the American
Dream - a central theme of the
novel. Detail is even placed on the
eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg that lie
quiet in the muck, watching over
the sins and successes of each char-
acter.
on the gate of Gatsby's mansion,
in wrought-iron lettering, there is
a Latin inscription: Ad finis fidelis.
Faithful to the end. As the story goes
on and we see that Gatsby would
sacrifice anything for his dream,
we sympathize completely. Even
Nick Carraway, a careful observer
of Gatsby's hope, remains loyal to
his ambition of retelling the story.
And as Carraway reads the last few
lines, we understand that we, too,
byno fault ofour own, are captive to
the dream that calls us. So we beat
on toward the ruddy shore, all light
and sensation suspended, souls for-
ever magnetized to our own green
light awaiting us.

'Vampires' mature with
dark, cohesive album

By KENDALL RUSS
Senior Arts Editor
To say that Vampire Weekend
has made a career out of prov-
ing people wrong would grossly
understate its
talent. But since A
its divisive 2007
debut, the band Vampire
has done exactly Weeked
that. The image
of four preppy Modern
Ivy Leaguers Vampires of
playing African- the City
inspired pop
music seemed XL
odd (if not
pretentious) to some - others
objected to the band's numerous
eccentricities, from Ezra Koe-
nig's wail and peculiar lyrics to
the airy instrumentation. When
the band responded with Contra,
an even weirder record that took
the criticism of Vampire Weekend
and reveled in it, it seemed com-
fortable as a talented but polariz-
ing band that paid little mind to
critics.
As the plaudits pour in for its
latest album, Modern Vampires of
the City, Vampire Weekend has
changed the game again. While
not radically remaking its aes-
thetic, the band has revamped
its sound, delivering its most
mature, complete and unobjec-
tionable record to date.
From the delicate piano chords
on the opening "Obvious Bicycle"
to the wandering guitar on "Han-
nah Hunt" to the percussion-less
finale, "Young Lion," Modern
Vampires witnesses Vampire
Weekend exploring and operat-
ing in the space between instru-
ments. The clutter of "Cousins"

or "California English" is notice-
ably absent; Koenig's voice is far
more inviting, and the underly-
ing restraint comforts against
depressing themes. The mes-
meric "Unbelievers" clothes its
harrowing chorus ("We know the
fire awaits unbelievers / All of the
sinners the same / Girl, you and
I will die unbelievers / Bound to
the tracks of the train") in jovial
harmony and buoyant strum-
ming. It feels remarkably light
for such a heavy song, a feeling
that Vampire Weekend replicates
throughout the album.
Despite its distance from Con-
tra, Modern Vampires undeniably
has Vampire Weekend's finger-
prints on it. There's the witty and
erudite lyricism on the immacu-
late "Step," the processed chant-
ing on "Ya Hey" that would
sound at home on the group's
second album and Koenig's idio-
syncratic wail on "Finger Back."
But Modern Vampires stands out;
it's more approachable than Con-
tra and more interesting than
Vampire Weekend.
The complaints of superfi-
ciality and worries of anxiety
that pervaded Vampire Week-
end's first two albums often felt
impersonal, as if Koenig unob-
trusively watched the fate of his
characters unfurl. On Modern
Vampires, the fear couldn't be
more immediate. Despite the soft
and serene feel to "Step," its final
plea ("I can't do it alone, I can't
do it alone") sounds helpless.
"Don't Lie" captures the fear of
the inevitable through images
of youth over glittering instru-
mentation. And while Koenig has
never been afraid to let his voice
soar, the way he belts the climac-

tic chorus on "Hannah Hunt"pis
among the most intimate, emo-
tive and arresting moments the
band has produced.
Vampire Weekend reveals
most when it's at its most reck-
less. "Diane Young" and "Finger
Back" captivate with relentless
percussion and guitar, and both
provide Koenig's clearest fears
of dying young. Even if the
darker themes are more evident
throughout the album, however,
the band ensures they do not
overwhelm. Modern Vampires
may be darker, but it can hardly
be called a dark record. It excels
precisely because of Vampire
Weekend's ability to apply its
weightless touch to a bleak theme
and come across not as preten-
tious or ironic, but as authentic,
honest and deeply moving.
Superior third
release proves
this group isn't
'Diane Young
Given such a sterling, cohe-
sive album, the vitriolic criti-
cism Vampire Weekend faced
for its debut and Contra seems
less relevant. Perhaps it was
misplaced all along. Whatever
the case, Vampire Weekend isn't
worried about answering crit-
ics - it would rather change the
conversation completely. After
all, as Koenig declares on "Step,"
"Stale conversation deserves but
a breadknife."
