'U' endowment
worth $7.8 billion
for FY 2011
By HALEY GLATTHORN
DailyStaffReporter
S The University's endowment
fund and fundraising efforts
were among the primary top-
ics University President Mary
Sue Coleman discussed during

a question-and-answer session
with University of Michigan
Health System surgeons yester-
day.
Coleman said the University's
endowment is currently worth
approximately $7.8 billion - up
from its 2010 fiscal year value
of $6.6 billion. State-allocated
funding continuously dropped
throughout Coleman's 10 years
at the University, she said. When
Coleman took office in 2002,
state contributions to the gener-

al fund came in at $368 million
- a number that has since fallen
to $240 million for this year.
"We have lost a pretty sub-
stantial amount of money each
(year)," Coleman said. "I'm not
under any illusion that we're
going to go back to wonderful
funding from the state."
Coleman explained that the
general fund's "unrestricted
money" allows for the pursuit
of faculty innovation and entre-
preneurship. Most donations to

the University can be used only
in the method prescribed by the
donor, and nearly 96 percent of
the"endowment is limited in its
use by donors or grant regula-
tions, according to Coleman.
Though Coleman said man-
agement of the University is
becoming increasingly similar
to a private institution, she said
it will always be a public univer-
sity.

'U' halts Orphan Works
Project in light of lawsuit

Mistakes made in
HathiTrust Digital
Library
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
DailyNews Editor
After acknowledging ' that
its Orphan Works Project
is "flawed," the University
announced Friday that it decid-
ed to suspend the pilot program
indefinitely.

The Orphan Works Project
is an initiative to identify books
that may have unsuspectingly
become part of the public domain
after their original copyrights
lapsed. The suspension of the
program comes just days after a
lawsuit was filed against the Uni-
versity claiming that the institu-
tion doesn't have permission to
use digital scans of more than 7
million copyrighted books.
Before halting the program,
the University was scheduled
to make 27 orphan works avail-

able for download through the
HathiTrust Digital Library on
Oct. 13 and another 140 books
were planned for release in
November. Any member of the
University community with a
uniqname would have access to
the scanned books.
The lawsuit against the Uni-
versity was filed by the Author's
Guild, the Australian Society
of Authors, Quebec Writers
Union and eight other individual
authors. The suit was also filed

Daily StaffReporter
In a meeting before the Uni-
versity's leading faculty gover-
nance body, Stephen Forrest,
the University's vice president of
research, said the University will

have to make significant changes
in the coming months to remain a
top research institute.
Though the University receives
federal funding for research -
particularly from the National
Institute of Health, the National
Science Foundation and the U.S.
Department of Defense - Forrest
said budgets from those institutes
are shrinking and told the Uni-
versity's Senate Assembly yester-
day that he's not yet sure how this
will affect the University.

"2012 is looking at signifi-

cies, and we don't know what
that's going to mean or how deep
they're going to be," Forrest said.
Forrest suggested that
researchers plan ahead for
research funding reductions by
being efficient in their work and
only hiring people they will really
need and can afford.

By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
For students and Ann Arbor
residents, city financial data
now reads like an online open
book.
At a press event before yes-
terday's city council meeting,
Tom Crawford, the city of Ann

Arbor's chief financial offi-
cer, introduced A20penBook,
an-interactive website, www.
a2gov.org/a2openbook, that
will give users a daily in-depth
look at the city's expenses and
revenue sources.
People who access the web-
site can look at expenditures
and revenue for any vendor that
received city funds. The infor-
mation can be viewed for dif-
ferent areas including expense
type, department or service
area, or by a specific budgeted
fund such as the city's water and

sewer fund.
Joshua Baron, senior appli-
cations specialist for the city,
explained that financial data
will be automatically uploaded
to A20penBook every 24 hours
from the city's internal financial
database.
"It will give you some
insights into our financial status
... in ways that have been harder
for citizens to see before," said
Crawford, who was formerly
the interim city administrator.

'U' launches male calendar

30 years ago this week: (Sept. 24,
1981) - After a Michigan State Uni-
versity calendar featuring scantily
clad male students sold more than 700
copies over three days in EastLansing,
students at the University of Michigan
tried to replicate the success of their
in-state rivals.
Wearing gym shorts and strategi-
cally placed towels, men from frater-
nities and varsity sports teams at the
University posed for the calendar free
of charge in hopes of upstaging the
Spartans.
Nancy Anderson, the calendar's
creator, told The Michigan Daily at
the time that the product was "clas-
sically suggestive" and that she found
all the models through recommenda-
tions from sororities and bar manag-
ers.

"When girls told me about some
really sharp guys, I trusted all those
votes of confidence," Anderson said
at the time, hinting that the models
were "really good-looking with good
bodies."
50 years ago this week: (Sept. 21,
1961) - Zeta Beta Tau became the first
fraternity to move its house to North
Campus.
Fifty-one men moved into the
house on the corner of Broadway and
Hubbard streets. ZBT made special
transportation arrangements to pick
up potential new members and drive
them from Central Campus as they
began the rush process.
"The new house is really not much
further away than our old one," ZBT
President Art Rosenbaum told the
Daily at the time. "It's just a bit more

secluded."
80 years ago this week: (Sept. 22,
1931) - New rules governing the
fraternity rush process, conceived by
the Interfraternity Council and Dean
of Students Joseph A. Bursley, went
into effect at the beginning of the new
academic year.
Several new restrictions were put
in place limiting the amount of inter-
action fraternity members could have
with the potential recruits.
For example, unless employed by a
fraternity, freshmen couldn't visit any
of the houses during the fall semester.
If a fraternity was holding an open
house, potential recruits and estab-
lished fraternity members were only
permitted to speak outside the event if
they were actually familial brothers.

her grant among several projects,
including research about the his-
tory of slavery in Detroit and
throughout the state of Michigan.
"It's a really fascinating story
that I look forward to having time
to delve into," she said. "And, of
course, having fellowship funds
helps to create time."
Miles also said she will devote

Yamashita wrote that she
will continue to study the biol-
ogy of stem cells, focusing on the
asymmetric division of the cells.
She said asymmetric division is
believed to generate tissue homeo-
stasis - or a stable condition -
and when it malfunctions, it can
become a causing factor of cancer
or tissue degeneration.
Sanford, who researches
organic and inorganic chemistry,
will work on the development of
metal catalysts to cause a reac-

Though the bonds are found in
many chemicals ranging from
DNA to shampoo, Sanford wrote
that the bonds are typically unre-
active. If the metal catalysts can
be used to cause a reaction, San-
ford wrote, the bond could be
made into new atom groups used
to make pharmaceuticals greener
and could also become possible

STUDENTS RECEIVE
FACULTY-FUNDED
SCHOLARSHIP
Earlier in the meeting, Semyon
Meerkov, a professor of electri-
cal engineering and computer
science, gave an update on the
first two student recipients of a
faculty-supported, need-based
fellowship called University Fac-
ulty Undergraduate Scholarship
Foundation, which he proposed
to SACUA in May 2007.
Meerkov said that 102 faculty
members donated money and
raised $66,760 for the students.
That amount was then matched
by the Office of the President and
the scholarship fund reached a
total of $121,514.
Because $6,000 is needed each
year to maintain the program,
Meerkov said additional funds
will be needed. To provide the
funding, Meerkov said the foun-
dation will have a campaign to
raise more money, and he urged
assembly members to make a
donation of $10 each month.
- The two recipients of the
scholarship, LSA senior Lama
Bandar and Engineering fresh-
man David Thompson, who each
receive $3,000 per year they're
in school, gave a brief speech to
the assembly about what theyS
have done or plan to do as under-
graduates.
Barald said she hopes more fac-
ulty members will donate to the
faculty Undergraduate Scholar-
ship Foundation.
"The faculty are only as good
as the students and vice versa,"
Barald said. "It's a real symbiotic
relationship."

funding."
In an interview after the meet-
ing, Kate Barald, chair of the
Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs and aprofessor
of cell and developmental biology
and biomedical engineering, said
she's worried about the future of
research with the possible fund-
ing cuts.
"Universities like Michigan
have a very large contingent of
people who are dependent on out-
side funding, and that means that
fewer people could be supported
if that funding stream dries up,"
Barald said. "Unless we can gar-
ner more philanthropy, we're in
trouble because the federal rev-
enue stream is drying up."
In addition, Barald said that
without grants, principal inves-
tigators wouldn't be able to sup-
port workers in their laboratories,
which means research techni-
cians and graduatestudents could
losetheir jobs. She addedthatthis
is the worst climate for federal
funding she's seen in 30 years.

At yesterday's city coun-

She sponsored an ordinance
on yesterday's agenda that

Dome stic dispute
Same-sex partners should get employee benefits
The Republican-led Michigan House is again attempting to
ban domestic partner benefits. The House passed two bills
last week, both of which seek to prohibit public employ-
ees from extending their benefits to live-in companions including
unmarried partners and roommates. These bills further demon-
strate Michigan Republicans' disregard of domestic partnerships,
and the state Senate should not pass them.

Though the legislation labels unmarried
heterosexual partners of state employees as
individuals who may not receive benefits, the
spirit of the law specifically targets same-
sex couples. The proposed bills would make
it impossible for same-sex partners of public
employees to receive benefits, since gay mar-
riage was banned in Michigan in 2004. If the
legislation passes in the Senate, unmarried het-
erosexual couples have recourse to obtain state
employee benefits. Same-sex couples - as leg-
islators well know - will not have that option.
After a series of recent, high-profile legisla-
tion recognizing the rights of homosexual men
and women - notably the state of New York -
it's unfortunate that the Michigan Legislature
continues its efforts to constrain what many
consider to be basic, equal rights. However,
that is exactly what the House did this week in
passing the pair of bills. The state Legislature
doesn't have the authority to define morality
and individual behaviors of consenting adults.
The passage of the legislation by the state Sen-
ate would limit access to benefits for people in
domestic partnerships.
This vote makes Michigan a particularly
unfriendly place for the gay community. If
t is bill does pass, Michigan could drive
homosexuals and the greater LGBTQ com-
munity out of the state. Analysts predict that
the ban could save the state about $8 mil-
lion in the upcoming year, but they neglect
to examine what could potentially be lost if
lawmakers push the LGBTQ community out
of Michigan. If the legislation truly stems

from economic considerations, then the Leg-
islature would be cutting partner benefits
across the board, instead of isolating a spe-
cific group. Since only domestic partnerships
are being targeted, the legislation is clearly
based on social considerations.
Though the proposal extends to universi-
ties, schools and local governments, Democrats
say public universities have the constitutional
power to establish their own rules regarding
partner benefits. The University should assert
its autonomy and allow for domestic compan-
ions to collect benefits regardless of the Senate
vote outcome. This cannot be a subject of col-
lective bargaining-the University should defy
the tentative ban and maintain its commitment
to diversity and equality.
The Michigan Civil Service Commission
also has the authority to decide on the types
of benefits given to state employees. A vote
already took place earlier this year to allow
domestic partner benefits for certain state
employees beginning in October. The Univer-
sity should follow the group's precedent and
offer the same benefits forlive-in companions.
As citizens of an open democracy, we
shouldn't be trying to restrict the practices
of individuals. The House should spend its
time working on bills pertaining to jobs and
the economy, rather than individual lifestyles.
Michigan can't afford to become an unfriend-
ly state to any community and should strive to
be a welcoming place. Senators should ensure
that this bill is thrown out when it reaches
their floor.

CAROLINE SYMS I
Many steps for health reform

Republican Gov. Rick Snyder recently pro-
posed his "revolutionary plan" to create a
healthier state - one that is free of obesity
and full of wellness. Snyder aims to grant
children better access to healthy foods and
exercise, regulate childhood obesity through
routine body mass measurements and create
an exchange for citizens and businesses to buy
health insurance. Snyder also wants Michigan
to join the 27 states that provide coverage for
autism. In addition to these governmental reg-
ulations, Snyder calls upon Michigan's citizens
to take control of their own lifestyles through
a new "4x4" fitness program that encourages
citizens to make healthier food choices, exer-
cise more frequently and take initiative to visit
their doctors regularly.
It's commendable that Snyder wants to
promote health throughout Michigan since
obtaining a healthy lifestyle should always be
a number one priority for all individuals. Sny-
der's decision to provide health coverage for
people with autism is also incredibly impor-
tant; it's time the government acknowledges
the severity of the disorder and does its best to
aid those affected. I am finding, however, that
Snyder has not thought through the logistics
of this new health reform as thoroughly as he
should.
For starters, it doesn't.seem plausible that
the government alone will be able to afford
to implement these drastic changes. So, what
does that mean for Michigan citizens? Taxes.
While Snyder does call upon federal funding
and grants to meet the requirements for his
plan, what will the source of that funding boil
down to? My best guess is taxpayers. Michi-
gan families will be the ones spending their
hard-earned dollars on Snyder's reforms, but
how are low-income families supposed to par-
ticipate?
This leads me to believe that it's not the
right time for Michigan to begin these numer-
ous health care modificaions. Why is Snyder
trying to turn obesity around right now? Yes,
changes need to start somewhere at some

time, but Americans across the country have
been struggling with obesity and health care
coverage for a long time with no real improve-
ments resulting. Similarly, engaging in Sny-
der's plan for an exclusively healthy diet seems
to be a leisure of the wealthy, since they are the
ones able to afford large supplies of organical-
ly grown foods and healthier products on the
whole. Low-income families don't have this
luxury, so Snyder's "4x4" plan isn't exactly
realistic for the entire state.
There certainly are alternative, more
affordable measures that the government
can implement for promoting healthy living
throughout the state. We know exercising
is one of the best things you can do for your
body, so why doesn't Snyder focus on organiz-
ing campaigns at local schools, events or busi-
nesses to relay the importance of engaging in
daily exercise? After all, walking or running in
the fresh air doesn't even cost a penny. If indi-
viduals of all ages are educated about the ben-
efits of exercise and the difference it makes in
creating healthy lifestyles, then everyone wins
and economic pressures are put to rest.
First and foremost, however, the local
government should place an emphasis on
childhood education in general, so children
can become intellectually capable of mak-
ing healthy choices and will have a chance to
overcome poverty by securing employment in
the future. This will help low-income families
overcome poverty. Then the state can focus
on these drastic reforms. By first controlling
unemployment and poverty, the state will
be much better off at actually succeeding in
health reform.
If Snyder uses smaller, tactful steps to
emphasize the sheer importance of both edu-
cation and simple exercise, it will go a long
way in leveling the economic playing field so
that everyone has equal opportunity to par-
ticipate in turning Michigan into a health-
conscious state.

The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled medical mari-
juana dispensaries in Michigan to be unconstitutional
Wednesday, Aug. 24. The following day, two dispensa-
ries in Ann Arbor were raided by the Livingston and
Washtenaw Narcotics Enforcement Team. State police
officers, in head-to-toe black outfits complete with face
masks, stood in front of MedMar on Packard and A2 Go
Green Corp on Main Street. Officers loaded cardboard
boxes into white vans, likely containing thousands of
dollars in assets. Three staff members were arrested.
With the entire hubbub, it is important to look at other
recent events before speculating about the future of
medical marijuana.
The Oakland County Narcotics Enforcement
Team conducted another raid almost exactly a year
ago. Spearheaded by Oakland County Sherriff Mike
Bouchard, more than $750,000 worth of medicine and
plants was seized from two dispensaries in Waterford
Township and Ferndale, Michigan.
Voters sent a strong message in Nov. 2008 when they
approved the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act by a 63
percent majority. As Chuck Ream, co-owner of MedMar,
said on Thursday in an AnnArbor.com article, "I real-
ly didn't think that they (federal police) would do this
because we have so much support from the voters here."
Unfortunately the lack of clarity in the legislation
allows for many to take advantage of the system, from
those participating in the industry to moralists who
wish to shut it down. This latest attack on local Michi-
gan businesses was not altogether unforeseeable. This
past June, the U.S. Department of Justice stated in a
public memo that people involved in cultivating, sell-
ing or distributing marijuana may be subject to federal
enforcement action and potential prosecution.
When Isabella County filed the complaint that the
Compassionate Apothecary in Mount Pleasant, Michi-
gan was a "public nuisance" that violated the pub-
lic health code, it was easy for the Michigan Appeals
Court to rule* the sale of pot between persons with
state-issued cards unconstitutional (i.e. virtually all
entities who make the MMMA possible).
Former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox
blocked previous Drug Enforcement Administration-
issued subpoenas for patient records, which demanded
everything from state-issued identification cards to
payment information. Cox rightfully cited the attempt
as a violation of patient confidentiality. Bill Schuette,

his successor, handed over the documents to the DEA
after less than a week of being in office.
The MMMA has never been succinct and has never
protected the people that it was supposed to empow-
er - allowing only the "delivery" and "transfer" of
medicine rather than explicit sale by a business. If the
law had included some mention of dispensaries, then
Michigan businesses would have had something legiti-
mate to stand behind. Dan Riffle, legislative analyst for
the Marijuana Policy Project, has stated the state ought
to have provided a control model for dispensaries, pro-
viding a legislative base that has been lacking thus far.
The law would be clear from either side of the fence,
and all dispensaries would be responsible for adhering
to a set of standards. Furthermore, the state could also
tax businesses, generating much-needed revenue fo- a
depressed economy.
It seems that such legislation will be necessary if the
medical marijuana industry hopes to continue. Opera-
tion within the "gray area" of the law will no longer
be possible. The bottom line is marijuana used for
medicinal purposes is legal - cardholders have a right
to their medication. Schuette and the DOJ clearly wish
for patients to look on the streets for their needs, since
in two short days they have simultaneously delegiti-
mized a process that has been approved by the people
of Michigan and deprived sick people of their rights.
Schuette's job is to protect and oversee laws, not make
new ones based on the fact that he's in the pocket of
pharmaceutical companies.
It's hard to say how the industry can rebound from
this setback. The day before the raids when dispen-
saries were ruled illegal, an intern at OM of Medi-
cine in Ann Arbor pointed out to me, this event only
serves to make any pro-pot organization that much
more difficult to exist. Many small business owners
saw their livelihoods literally dismantled before their
eyes because of the raids, losing funds and assets as
well as spirit. Despite President Barack Obama's prom-
ises regarding medical marijuana, his administration's
DOJ has interfered more than that of former President
George W. Bush. What's even more disheartening?
That in this economic downturn, a Michigan official
would be willing to halt a source of revenue instead of
accommodating it.

In a statement released Fri-

"(We've been) smart about the

Coleman reported an aver-
age 9-percent annual return on
investments for the endowment
over the past 10 years, despite
suffering a negative 23-percent
return in 2009. In fiscal year
2010, the University experienced
a 12.3-percent return on invest-

"We're not using these books
in any way that competes with
the use of the marketplace," Cou-
rant said.
However, the Author's Guild
- a non-profit organization
that supports the legal rights of
authors - published a blog post.
on its website last Wednesday
that said the guild had located one
of the authors included on the list
of orphan works to be released by
the University.
The author, J.R. Salamanca, is
a professor emeritus at the Uni-
versity of Maryland. The Author's
Guild wrote in the blog that Sal-
amanca wrote two successful
books that were made into mov-
ies - starring Elvis Presley and
Warren Beatty - and will soon
have one of his books rereleased
as an e-book.
The Author's Guild reached out
to Salamanca's son and his liter-
ary agent, neither of whom knew
that his work was to be included
in the Orphan Works Project.
"(Salamanca's son) told us
that he, too, hadn't heard of the
HathiTrust Orphan Works Proj-

ect and was stunned to learn that
his father's first book was set to
be released online to hundreds of
thousands of students," the blog
states.
The University Library state-
ment said the University will con-
tinue to work with the authors
and publishers to ensure the proj-
ect is a success.
"The widespread dissemina-
tion of the list has had the intend-
ed effect: rights holders have
been identified, which is in fact
the project's primary goal," the
statement reads. "And as a result
of the design of our process, our
mistakes have not resulted in the
exposure of even one page of in-
copyright material."
Paul Aiken, executive director
of the Authors Guild - the lead
plaintiff in the lawsuit - said in
an interview with the Daily last
week that the authors are asking
for an injunction to remove the
copyrighted works off the Inter-
net until Congress establishes
a firm policy regarding digital
libraries.
"Security is a top concern,"
Aiken said. "These works do not
belong to the universities."

Oglesby was battling lung can-
cer that had expanded into other
parts of his body. He died last
Tuesday in his home in Mont-
clair, N.J.
Oglesby attended classes at
the University in the early 1960s
while working for a defense con-
tractor. He came into contact
with University activist group
Students for a Democratic Soci-
ety in 1964 and was so passion-
ate about its message that he
soon became the organization's
president.
Tom Hayden, a University
alum, activist and former Michi-
gan Daily editor in chief, said
Oglesby joined SDS when the
Vietnam War was beginning to
garner greater national atten-
tion.
"He was an important fig-

ure in the anti-war movement,"
Hayden said. "He was not just an
activist but a serious intellectual
(and) a serious writer. More than
anything else, (he was) a special-
ist in words."
On Nov. 27, 1965, Oglesby gave
one of the mostly widely recog-
nized speeches of the era at an
anti-war rally in Washington
D.C. During his speech, titled
"Let Us Shape the Future,"
Oglesby criticized American
political leaders by saying,
"good men can be divided from
their compassion by the insti-
tutional system that inherits us
all."
Oglesby was 30 years old
when he joined SDS, and Stephen
Selbst, a former Daily writer who
wrote an article on former SDS
leaders in the 1970s, said many of
the organization's members con-
sidered Oglesby a mentor.
"He was like the older states-
man," Selbst said. "Most of the
people he was dealing with
were students, so he was half a
generation older. Many of the
students sort of looked up to
him as the grandfather (of the
group)."
Hayden said 1965 marked the
start of Americans "questioning
the draft and questioning the
war," and Oglesby captured that
doubt in his speeches during his
term as SDS president and after.
The anti-war movement that

SDS began at the Univelsity in
1960 later spread throughout the
country and pushed SDS into the
national and media spotlight as
a symbol of student empower-
ment. However, Hayden said
by 1968, the organization had
become irreconcilably divided
and came to an end shortly
thereafter.
"People like Carl were wound-
ed by that because they had
invested their lives and their
careers by taking years of time
and devoting it to a cause that
was embodied by an organiza-
tion," Hayden said. "So when
the organization fell apart, they
were wounded. It took a long
time to recover."
Oglesby's later accomplish-
ments include teaching at
Dartmouth University and
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and publishing sev-
eral books, including a memoir
in 2008. Hayden said Oglesby
will be most remembered for his
speeches that compassionately
encompassed the anti-war per-
spectives of the time.
"I don't think he'll be remem-
bered for an organizational
contribution or having changed
public policy. I think he'll be
remembered and referred to as
a voice of a generation," Hayden
said. "Not the only voice, but the
particular voice of SDS and its
opposition to Vietnam."


ment to fund faculty projects.
"What keeps me awake at
night (is) generating the money
that we have to have to fund fac-
ulty ideas,"Coleman said. "The
faculty always has more great
ideas than we have the (money
to fund). That's the end all, be all
for me."
Coleman added that the state
cannot regulate the organization
of the University's endowment
- unlike funding regulations at
other institutions like the Uni-
versity of North Carolina. The
endowment at UNC is regulated
through "35 budget lines" that
manage funding for various ben-
eficiaries within the university.
Additionally, the number of
out-of-state students admitted to
the University is unrestricted by

the state, which Coleman said is
unusual for a public university.
The ratio of in-state to out-of-
state students at the University
has traditionally been 65 percent
to 35 percent since 2004.
Full-time undergraduate LSA
students from out-of-state are
paying $18,794 per semester this
academic year, while Michigan
residents with the same provi-
sions are paying $6,220, accord-
ing to the University's Office of
the Registrar website.
"Our hands are not tied," Cole-
man said. "(However), there may
be political realities. We wouldn't
want to go to 70 percent out-of-
state because that would be seen
as an affront to the state, but right
now I think we're in a very advan-
tageous position."

Don't care 'How She Does It'

No Oscars for
movie magic

Sarah Jessica
Parker in another
self-centered film
By LEAH BURGIN
Senior Arts Editor
"I Don't Know How She Does
It" is to movies what White Peo-
ple Problems is to the Internet:
The meme can
be funny, it can **
be poignant,
but in the end, I Don't
it gets annoy-
ing. Similar Know How
to the endless She Does It
Tumblr streams
bemoaning how At Quality16
far away a com- and Rave
puter charger is The Weinstein
or how someone Company
had too much
food for lunch,
"I Don't Know How She Does It"
focuses on the seemingly endless
day-to-day "problems" in Kate
Reddy's (Sarah Jessica Parker,
"Sex and the City 2") perfectly
normal life.
Like most people in this world
who have multiple commitments,
Kate struggles to find a way to
juggle the different spheres of her
life, be it her fast-paced financial
career, planning birthday parties
for her two adorable children or
finding time for romance with her
equally adorable hubby Richard
(Greg Kinnear, "Baby Mama").
While the film explores these
realistic issues most people have
to deal with, it does so in an unre-
alistic way.
"I Don't Know How She Does
It" takes away the universality
of balancing one's life and makes
it a feat only Kate can perform
successfully. In addition to Kate

"You didn't see me in 'Mamma Mia!,' did you?'

bizarrely popping out of frozen
scenes to address the audience
with cheesy remarks on situa-
tions, the fourth wall is broken
frequently and disjointedly by
"Office"-esque asides. These bar-
rages come from Kate's babysit-
ter Paula (Jessica Szohr, TV's
"Gossip Girl"), assistant Momo
(Olivia Munn, "Iron Man 2"), best
friend Allison (Christina Hen-
dricks, TV's "Mad Men"), work
enemy Chris Bunce (Seth Meyers,
TV's "Saturday Night Live") and
rival Wendy Best (Busy Philipps,
"Made of Honor"), who all gush
over how unbelievable Kate is and
how they can't understand how
she keeps it all together.
These asides are apoor artistic
choice, as they rely on a heavy-
handed approach to discuss the
film's key themes without any
attempt at subtlety. They empha-
size the one-dimensional nature
of the supporting characters but
can also be quite amusing - espe-
cially those delivered by Meyers

- or impactful, like the points
Hendricks's character brings up
to demonstrate the inequality of
women in the workplace.
One particularly illustrative
example Hendricks uses is the
difference between a man and a
woman leaving work to pick up
a sick child - a man is hailed as
a loving, caring hero of a father
while a woman in the same situ-
ation is considered unorganized,
disobedient and too emotional.
For 20-something females who
may soon enter the workplace
and start a family, this is scary to
think about. This commentobrings
into sharp relief that these are
issues all working moms face, and
they face them every day. Even
though everyone else in the movie
thinks Kate is special, she isn't.
It's because of the unfairness
of these double standards that
the relationship between Kate
and her project partner Jack
Abelhammer (Pierce Brosnan,
"Mamma Mia!") is so refreshing.

While there is, initially, some
sexual tension between the two,
Kate and Jack ultimately develop
a friendship - with Jack call-
ing her Bill for who knows what
reason - during their long hours
spent together working on a pro-
posal. In an uncommonly por-
trayed dynamic, Jack and Kate
are equals, not a Good Old Boy
treating a female colleague like
a secretary or sex object. Their
relationship doesn't go the other
way either, with Kate losing her
femininity to become a "bro."
While Kate and Jack have an
enlightening friendship, their
interactions can't save the rest of
the film from the trite dialogue,
overused situational humor and
general blandness that perme-
ate the story's my-life-is-hard-
so-pity-and-revere-me attitude.
If anything, "I Don't Know How
She Does It" really only proves
one thing - Pierce Brosnan is the
only human alive who can make
bowling look sexy.


This summer, the
"Harry Potter" film
series came to its
dramatic conclusion with the
much-anticipated final install-
ment _
"Harry
Potter and
the Death-
ly Hallows:
Part 2."
Maybe
you heard
about it. PHILIP
Since its CONKLIN
release, the-
film has
been the subject of a certain
amount of 2012 Oscar buzz,
which is warranted consider-
ing its critical and commercial
success.
The film performed bet-
ter at the box office than its
seven predecessors. It holds
the record for biggest opening
weekend, is the third highest-
grossing film of all time world-
wide (the next highest-ranking
Potter film is 2001's "Sorcerer's
Stone") and holds the all-time
record for highest-grossing
opening day. It was also widely
heralded by critics, earning
a score of 96 percent on the
popular online film review
aggregator Rotten Tomatoes
("Prisoner of Azkaban" is next
highest at 91 percent).
To add to the film's Oscar
chances, the Academy has a
penchant for awarding Oscars
for sentimental reasons. Al
Pacino's Best Actor win in 1993
for "Scent of a Woman" and
Hal Holbrook's Best Support-
ing Actor nod for 2008's "Into
the Wild" were both recogni-
tions of brilliant careers, not
necessarily brilliant individual
performances. And no film
could be more sentimental than
the conclusion to the cross-
geherational, culture-defining
"Harry Potter" series.
Despite all this, "Deathly
Hallows: Part 2" will not win
the Best Picture Oscar. It will
probably be nominated, but
it won't win. And even those
critics who praised it so highly,
even the diehard fans of the
film, surely would admit that
it's hard to imagine a film like
this one winning Best Picture.
It just doesn't seem right.
It's because the Academy
doesn't give awards in the
major categories to films that
aren't "serious," in their stuffy,
conservative definition of
that word. "Serious," to them,
means films that aren't ani-
mated, comedies or targeted at
a young audience. And "Harry
Potter" is a prime example of a
film that the Academy doesn't
find to be "serious," and doesn't
take seriously. If "Harry Pot-
ter" were an eight-part series
about the Holocaust, it would
be a shoe-in for every major
award this Oscar season.
Take the 2011 Oscars. "The
Social Network" and "The
King's Speech" had battled
pretty evenly in the awards
shows leading up to the Oscars.
But when it came to Oscar
night, "King's Speech" beat
out "Social Network" in every
major category in which they
were both nominated - Best

Picture, Director and Actor.
This didn't happen because
of either film's relative quality.
I think "The Social Network"
was a better film than "The
King's Speech" (and so did the
Golden Globes, if that legiti-

mizes my opinion at all). It's
because "King's Speech" fits
the model of what the Acad-
emy considers a "serious" film
better than does "The Social
Network." It is an uplifting
story of a man overcoming
overwhelming odds, starring
well-established actors, with a
conventional narrative struc-
ture. "The Social Network," on
the other hand, is a film about
and for the youth, with an edgi-
er visual style and more adven-
turous narrative structure.
This misappropriation of
Oscars can be summed up thus-
ly: Regardless of a film's artistic
merit, the Academy will not
consider films outside of their
aforementioned narrow-mind-
ed, arbitrary notions of what is
"serious." Films within these
strict parameters are compared
based on merit, but anything
,outside of them is ignored.
This is the reason animated
films are not given their due at
the Oscars. While the Best Ani-
mated Film category assures
that animated films will be rec-
ognized at the Oscars, it also
marginalizes them, implying
they are inferior to live-action
films. In the history of the
Academy Awards, only three
animated films have ever been
nominated for Best Picture:
"Beauty and the Beast" (1991),
"Up" (2009), and "Toy Story
3" (2010) - a fact that is even
more shocking when you con-
sider the number of great ani-
mated films that have come out
just in the last 20 years (all the
Pixar films, "The Iron Giant"
and Hayao Miyazaki's films).
While the recent increase in
animated film representation
in the Best Picture category
seems encouraging, it becomes
less so when you consider the
increase two years ago to 10
nominees.
The Academy
is probably full
of Slytherins
anyhow.
Comedies also fall short of
the Academy's strict conditions
for approval. A comedy, clearly,
cannot be "serious." The only
comedy to win Best Picture
in the last 30 years is "Shake-
speare in Love" (1998).
To name all the worthy
candidates since then would
be an undertaking too ambi-
tious for this column. Suffice
it to say that comedy gets no
respect. No matter how funny,
well-crafted or well-written
a comedy is, it will still be an
underdog to every halfway
decent drama.
Clearly, many worthy films
are not getting their due at
the Oscars. We can only hope
that, preferably in the next few
years, the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences will
remove itself from the stuffy,
narrow-minded rut it has
become stuck in, and, disre-

garding a film's genre or target
demographic, judge films only
on their value as a work of cin-
ematic art.

Pankratz benefits
from local talent

Junior running back Vincent Smith rushed for 118 yards on nine carries in Michigan's 31-3 victory over Eastern Michigan at Michigan Stadium on Saturday.
Smith emerges as Michigan's
third featured runnng back

ByLIZVUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Birthday parties aren't usually
ironic.
But sophomore Ainsley McCal-
lier can't help laughing whin she
thinks back to a celebration she
attended in elementary school.
The theme was Michigan field
hockey. And when a picture of
the attendees was taken on Ocker
Field that day, McCallister never
imagined that she would later
return to that same turf not as a
party guest, but as a midfielder
for the Michigan women's field
hockey team.
The photo is still on McCal-
lister's wall, acting as a memento
of her earliest field hockey days.
And she's not alone on the team as
one who grew up surrounded by
Michigan's field hockey program.
Like Pioneer High School
alumnae freshman Emy Guttman
and redshirt sophomore Haley
Jones, McCallister - who wentto
Huron High School - grew up in
Ann Arbor. And all three decided
to stay in their hometown for a
chance to playforhe Wolverines.
If yuu had asked any uf them
a few years ago if they imagined
coming to Michigan, the answer
is a resounding no.
But Michigan coach Marcia
Pankratz isn't surprised that each
player changed her mind.
"A lot of these players grew
up with Michigan," Pankratz
said. "They bleed maize and blue.
They've dreamed of wearing the
uniform their whole lives. They
love it and want to win champi-
onships for Michigan."
McCallister echoed those sen-
timents while recalling the day
she committed.
"Once I came on junior day and
got the offer, it was eye opening,"
McCallister said. "I saw what a
great school it was,and fell in love
with the program. It makes you
want to represent the block 'M."'
These attitudes aren't surpris-
ing considering the University
is located in a field hockey hot-
bed. Both Huron and Pioneer are
consistently the top-ranked high
school programs in the state. Ann
Arbor Community Recreation
and Education offers club teams
for players as young as eight. Pan-
kratz cites this "rich tradition of
field hockey" as a reason she's
always eager to recruit local play-

ers.
"There are some great coach-
es in this area," Pankratz said.
"There are wonderful athletes
and we love having players out
of this particular area because
they're' all well coached and
strong players."
This strong sporting com-
munity not only builds relation-
ships between the local athletes
- Guttman, Jones and McCallis-
ter have all played together since
middle school - but also forges
early relationships with Michi-
gan's program.
Jones defeated McCallister on
Ocker Field for the 2008 MHSAA
State Championship title. Gutt-
man remembers frequenting the
Michigan games as a child. While
these circumstances seemed to
have foreshadowed the futures of
the three athletes, it is these early
interactions that prove advanta-
geous for Pankratz when itcomes
to recruiting.
"(Recruiting) rules prevent
you from having any communi-
cation with players before their
junior year unless they're on
yuur campus," Pankratz said.
"Because they're here and cme
onto campus, we get to establish
relationships early, which is nice.
"We get to know their fam-
ily, get to know them and know if
they're a good fit."
More than anything, the play-
ers appreciate the support from
family members when playing for
the Wolverines.
"I like being close to my fam-
ily," McCallister said. "It's nice
that they can come and see me
compete, whereas if I went some-
where else they wouldn't have
had the same opportunities."
For highly recruited high
school athletes, the appeal of leav-
ing their hometown is a big draw
when deciding where to commit.
When convincing Ann Arbor's
talents to stay local, Pankratz
emphasizes the possibility to
maintain independence and have
new experiences despite living in
the town theyhave always known
- something Guttman, Jones and
McCallister all attest to.
"Living in the dorms and being
downtown, I rarely go home,"
Guttman said. "I don't feel like
I'm in my hometown. I feel like
I'm away.
"I would not want to be any-
where else but here."

Junior moves from
third-down back
to Hoke's main
halfback weapon
By MICHAEL FLOREK
DailySports Writer
Despite standing at just
5-foot-6, Vincent Smith isn't
looking up to others anymore.
After the junior rushed for
118 yards on just nine carries
in the Michigan football team's
win over Eastern Michigan,
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
announced him as the new fea-
ture back on Monday.
"I think Vince right now
has earned that right, his per-
formance and his production,"
Hoke said. "He played good
with his vision on where to go
and listening to (running backs'
coach) Fred (Jackson) as we go
through the game about press-
ing the ball more on the line of
scrimmage and then reacting
off the center's tail end."

But Smith is looking side-
ways. In the running back
battle during fall camp, he was
beat out by both senior Michael
Shaw and redshirt sophomore
Fitzgerald Toussaint.
While Smith won the third-
down running back spot, which
Hoke said Monday kept him "in
the picture," he had just three
total carries in the first two
games.
Despite Hoke saying Smith
was the lead back, both Shaw
and Toussaint remained ahead
of Smith on the 22nd-ranked
Wolverines' depth chart.
After Hoke and offensive
coordinator Al Borges both
insisted they wanted to find a
lead running back to take about
20 carries per game, it appears
Michigan is headed for a run-
ning back-by-committee sys-
tem.
"We don't want it that way,
but I think we're there at this
point in time," Hoke said.
Whether it's alone or not,
Smith is leading the charge, at
least for next Saturday's game
against San Diego State. His

first two carries against the
Eagles went for 38 and 27 yards,
respectively.
He had three more rushes for
mere than 10 yards throughout
the game.
Meanwhile, Toussaint is
coming off a shoulder injury
that caused him to miss the
Notre Dame game, and Shaw's

against San Diego State, Smith's
third-down duties - and obvi-
ously his height - won't change.
The two are more related than
it initially appears.
Smith won the position
mainly because of his superb
blocking abilities.
Counterintuitively, his stat-
ure gives him a bonus in that

hl
a

area.
"You can't see him," fifth-
year senior center David Molk
'He likes to said. "No one can see him."
But his blocking relies on
it, that's the more than a sneak attack. On
a team that finds a way to slip
veird thing "toughness" 'into nearly everya
press conference, it's fitting
LbOut him. that Hoke's shortest non-place-
kicker on the team is one of the

Michigan eyes the curse of an AP top-25 ranking

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
It took the voters an extra
week this season, but the Michi-
gan football team is ranked in
the AP top 25 once again.
After starting each of the last
three seasons unranked, the
Wolverines climbed onto the
board after
second-week NOTEBOOK
victories over
Notre Dame in 2009 and 2010.
Michigan jumped to No. 22 on
the charts after a 31-3 win over
Eastern Michigan on Saturday.
And while the rank might be a
confidence boost, the players
feel like it pins a target on their
backs.
"I think it's a curse," senior
defensive tackle Ryan Van Ber-
gen said Monday. "I would rath-
er not be ranked until the end of
the season when it goes down
to bowl games. When you're
ranked, all it does it is put some-
thing on a chalkboard for the
other team. ... That's a big stat, if
you can get a win against a top-
25 team. People notice that."
With a 3-0 record, the Wol-
verines now sit atop the Big Ten,
tied with Nebraska in the Lead-
ers division and Illinois and Wis-
consin in the Legends division.
But the wins haven't been so
impressive. It took a 28-point
fourth quarter to topple Notre
Dame, 35-31, on Sept. 10. And
Michigan still hasn't scored a
point in any first quarter.
"I think we're vastly over-
rated," senior tight end Kevin
Koger said. "I mean, that's just
how it is. We have so much stuff

to work on. We have alot of time
to get it fixed, but for us to be in
the top 25 right now is kind of
ridiculous."
Michigan'coach Brady Hoke,
whose all-time record reached
50-50 with Saturday's victory,
said he didn't vote for his team in
the USA Today poll - the Wol-
verines are No. 21 on that poll.
But did Hoke talk'to the team
about the ranking?
"Does it matter?" Hoke asked.
Well, no.
"Exactly."
RED ZONE RULERS: While
Michigan may spurn the No. 22
ranking, the Wolverines have to
be pleased with what both the
offense and defense have done
inside the 20-yard lines this sea-
'son.
The defense has struggled to
slow opposing offenses down
through three games. But once
teams enter the red zone - inside
the 20-yard lines - Michigan's
defense has been a brick wall.
Defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison's corps have been
world-beaters in defending
against red-zone offenses. Oppo-
nents have emerged with points
just six times in 10 red-zone trips
- two of those scores being field
goals - good for second in the
Big Ten.
"Coach Mattison emphasizes
the red zone as being one of the
most important things," Van
Bergen said.
"Everybody thinks the offense
gets better in the red zone -
that's not our perspective. The
field gets shorter and there's the
same amount of guys out there.
We think that we have better

odds in the red zone, when it
comes down to it."
Michigan has come away with
four takeaways in the red zone,
with two fumble recoveries and
two goal-line interceptions.
The team's turnover margin
of plus-six ranks fourth in the
nation - Michigan was minus-32
over the past three years.
Van Bergen attributed the
turnover turnaround to added
emphasis in practice.
"We're constantly going after
the ball in practice against our
own guys, regardless of if it's
tackle or not," Van Bergen said.
"The main emphasis is strip the
ball no matter what. We jump
on incomplete passes every time
like it's a fumble."
Added Hoke: "Tight cover-
age, pressuring the QB, effort
and guys getting to the football.
Those four components usually
turn into turnover opportuni-
ties."
And on the offensive side of
the ball, Michigan has feasted in
the red zone.
The Wolverines have scored
on each of their 10 trips inside
the opposing20-yard line - with
only one field goal. Their near-
perfect red-zone touchdown
percentage sits at seventh in the
nation and first in the Big Ten.
NO GOOD WAY TO LEAVE:
Mass texts are rarely the answer
to anything.
But that's just how Hoke left
San Diego State's football pro-
gram - Michigan's opponent
this Saturday.
Hoke, who coached the Aztecs
for the past two seasons, was
hired to replace former Michi-

gan coach Rich Rodriguez on
Jan. 11 this year.
Since his transition occurred
over San Diego State's win-
ter break, Hoke was stuck. He
couldn't gather his players to
meet one final time like he did
when he left Ball State. The way
he notified the Aztecs, though,
was nothing short of unortho-
dox. Hoke's decision to leave the
Aztecs created a buzz across the
nation, but it also set off a buzz in
each of his players' pockets.
"I texted them all, just a mass
text," Hoke said.

"I don't know how you tell
people. We were on a little bit of
a schedule, time-wise."
Before leaving, Hoke was
involved with scheduling the
game between Michigan and San
Diego State. He never thought
he'd be coaching on the home
sideline during that game at
Michigan Stadium.
When he arrived at Michigan,
Hoke stood just nine months
away from playingthe same play-
ers he'd recruited, made promis-
es to and brought to the national
platform. And the same players

he'd texted his goodbyes to.
"I told Dave Brandon, 'Let's
buy that (game) out,"' Hoke said,
laughing. "The game's sched-
uled, you've got to play it. It
would have been way too hard
for both teams to try and find
new opponents."
But that wasn't sentimental.
"Because they're good," Hoke
said.
Hoke eventually tried to
downplay the matchup.
"It's San Dieg State playing
Michigan, that's all it really is."
But it's so much more.
