Japan quake

Michigan point guard Darius Morris is consoled by teammate Corey Person after the Wolverines' 73-71 loss to Duke yesterday. Morris missed a shot in the final
seconds of the third-round matchup that would have tied the game. For more, see SportsMonday, inside.
Michigan s story is told
through the sound of silence

Students relieved
by families' safety,
plan to organize
fundraisers
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily News Editor
At first, LSA junior Michelle
Resnick's school day at Doshi-
sha University in Kyoto, Japan
on Friday, March 11 started out
like any other. But as she and her
classmates sat in a school lounge
eight hours from Tokyo, an
earthquake and tsunami were
uprooting the northeastern part
of the country.
Resnick is one of the 10 Uni-
versity undergraduate students
studying abroad in Japan. She,
as well as other Japanese stu-
dents on campus, had a personal
connection to the disaster when
the 9.0-magnitude earthquake
and tsunami hit the northeast
coast of the country, killing an
estimated 18,000 people and
disrupting nuclear reactors at
the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear
power plant.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the 10 under-

graduate students and six grad-
uate students studying abroad
in Japan at the time of the quake
are all safe and were not harmed
by the disaster.
Still in the southwest city of
Kyoto, Resnick said via a Skype
interview this weekend that she
is far from the epicenter of the
destruction and didn't feel any-
thing at the time of the earth-
quake. It wasn't until turning
on the news later that night that
she truly saw the impact of the
disaster.
"I was shocked. This is the
first time I've been even this
close to a natural disaster on this
level. You look at the pictures on
the news and the destruction
especially in Sendai, which is
the epicenter - it was a lot to
take in, honestly," Resnick said.
As she watched the news,
Resnick said the hardest imag-
es to see were people digging
through the rubble looking for
their family members.
While Resnick was watching,
the news in Japan, LSA junior
Tetsuro Matsushima, a one-
year exchange student from the
University-of Tokyo, was in Ann
Arbor, where he avidly moni-
tored tweets and e-mails from

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -
This wasn't a season that
could be captured in
a still frame. It wasn't
a team that could be defined
in 900 words. And it wasn't a
moment that anyone - not even
Darius Morris - had words for.
No, to understand what hap-
pened in that moment, that
game, that season, you need to
hear to believe.
And few will actually listen
for it, because you would have
to look for those sounds in the

unlikeliest
of places.
You'd have
to listen to
the silences.,
And no one
is looking
there.C CHANTEL
Just like JENNINGS
no one was
looking at
Michigan before this season
started.
All that can be said, explained
and extrapolated about this

team and its emotions were
heard in those silences through-
out Time Warner Cable Arena
yesterday.
It was the sound of silence as
the ball left Morris' hands and
arched perfectly toward the bas-
ket until that idyllic silence was
broken by the ding of the ball
meeting the heel of the rim.
But in that moment of silence,
there was hope - desperate
hope. The hope of a team of
ragtag kids who were under-
recruited and underappreciated.

It was the hope that the team,
led by two Indiana boys in black
sneakers, has held this entire
season. It was the hope of John
Beilein as he leaned forward,
anticipating the exact result he'd
seen in practice so many times
when Morris took that same
shot.
And then came the ding.
There was the silence of the
aftermath. The silence of disbe-
lief. The silence that shook the
team to its core that comes with

'U' ACLU aims to

in residence halls
By SABIRA KHAN
Daily StaffReporter
Canvassers campaigning for
President Barack Obama or his
Republican challenger in the 2012

presidential election may face new
guidelines when soliciting support
in University residence halls.
The University's Residence
Halls Association is aiming to
create a collaborative group com-
prised of members of RHA, Uni-
versity Housing officials and other
student groups, which would
work to create guidelines and a
long-term policy on canvassing
in University residence halls. The

development of the group was
the subject of an RHA resolu-
tion passed by the association last
Thursday.

SHEAR HOPE

Cornell University's chapter
of Sigma Alpha Epsilon will be
removed from campus after new
information surfaced surround-
ing the death of Cornell Univer-
sity sophomore George Desdunes,
according to a March 18 article in
The Cornell Daily Sun.
Susan Murphy, Cornell's vice
president of Student and Academ-
ic Services, told The Cornell Daily
Sun that Desdunes was given
alcohol by his brothers at SAE.
The alcohol is believed to have
played a part in Desdunes's death.
"Even though the members and
associate members recognized
the condition Desdunes was in,
they failed to call for medical
care," Murphy said in the article.
Desdunes' death is under

investigation and SAE fraternity
members have been given until
the end of the month to leave
their house on campus, the article
states.
UNIVERSITY OF
COLORADO STUDENT
GOV'T OFFICER CALLED
OUT FOR OFFENSIVE BLOG
University of Colorado gradu-
ate student Matthew Cucchiaro
resigned from his position as
diversity director of the univer-
sity's student government as a
result of a controversial blog,
according to a March 18 article
in the CU Independent.
Cucchiaro's blog, stupidhu-
manbeings.com, was intended

to be satirical, the CU Indepen-
dent reported. Several posts con-
tained derisive comments toward
women and those of African
descent.
"The women article was more
of a political statement, a social
statement about kind of the
jock mentality of stereotyping
}women, where a woman is stu-
pider than a man," Cucchiaro
told the CU Independent.
Cucchiaro started the blog
in 2009 and resigned from his
student government position on
March 4 after an anonymous
source led the Dean of Students
to question Cucchiaro as the
author, according to the article.

Obama touts democracy in Brazil

President to
visit Chile today
during first South
American tour
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -
Immersing himself in Brazil's
poverty and pride, President
Barack Obama yesterday held up
the South American nation as a
model of democratic change in a
time of uprisings and crackdowns
across the Arab world and yet
another war front for the United
States.
From Rio's glamorous beaches
to a notorious slum to an elegant
theater, Obamaglimpsed the city's
cultural extremes and offered
the kind of personal engagement
that can pay political dividends
for years. Less than one day after
announcing U.S. military strikes
against Libya's government,
Obama made time to kick a soccer
ball around with kids in a shanty-
town.
The competing stories of
Obama's itinerary - a war front
in Africa, an economic commit-
ment to South America - divided

his time in incongruous ways.
By morning, he spoke with his
security team about the interna-
tional assault against Moammar
Gadhafi's defenses; by night, he
was to stand atop a mountain and
admire Rio's world famous statue
of Jesus.
Meanwhile, U.S. warplanes
pounded faraway Libya.
It was all summed up by one
image: Obama, adeptly juggling
a soccer ball, as his aides helped
him juggle his agenda.
In a speech, Obama celebrated
Brazil as a place that has shifted
from dictatorship to democracy,
moving millions into its middle
class and embracing human
rights. He underlined that point
as unrest sweeps the Middle East
and north Africa, leading to dra-
matic change in some cases and
violent crisis in Libya.
"As 'two nations who have
struggled over many generations
to perfect our own democracies,
the United States and Brazil know
that the future of the Arab world
will be determined by its people,"
Obama told an invitation-only
crowd inside an ornate hall here.
"No one can say for certain
how this change will end, but I

do know that change is not some-
thing that we should fear," he
said. "When young people insist
that the currents of history are on
the move, the burdens of the past
are washed away."
His speech and his whole trip
to this region have been overshad-
owed by the onset of war in Libya.
Obama has tried to find a balance
of showing command of the war
strategy without altering his dip-
lomatic mission or offending his
hosts in Latin America.
And on Sunday, he was deter-
mined to be with his family, get
among the people and feel the
culture.
Obama and his family visited
the City of God shantytown that
gained fame through a movie
of the same name. The slum is
undergoing a transformation as
Rio works to improve the plight
of its poorest people and clean up
its reputation ahead of hosting the
2016 summer Olympics.
Obama, his wife Michelle and
their daughters, Malia and Sasha,
watched young children pound
on drums and perform a dazzling
acrobatic dance. And then all the
Obamas took turns at a little soc-
cer, led by the president.

Obama chose a community
center in the heart of one of more
than1,000 slums,or"favelas,"that
dot the urban hills surrounding
the city. The tour was designed to
illustrate Obama's push for what
officials call citizen security, an
emerging concern in Latin Ameri-
can countries as they wrestle with
narco-crime and poverty.
Dozens of young children
pressed up against a chain-link
fencetryingtoget alook atObama;
the president ultimately stepped
outside and gave a big wave.
Obama's route to the slum was
itself a contrast of life. The presi-
dent began and ended his day in
a hotel that fronted the famed
Copacabana beach, where tour-
ists and locals in bathing suits
soaked in the sun and watched for
his motorcade.
"He is thinking of Rio as more
than just the Christ and Copaca-
bana," said Noemia Marinho, a
40-year-old lingerie saleswoman
who lives in the slum and had her
hair done just for the president's
visit."Maybe ourgovernment will
look to us more as well." .
The president's tour had an
underlying goal of endearing
him to a diverse and multicul-

the stage for the eventual end of a
20-year military dictatorship.
Here, once again, Obama made
a game effort to connect to the
locals. That included making a
solid effort at speaking some Por-
tuguese, drawing some cheers
and a few wry smiles from the
audience.

NEWS BRIEFS
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.
College student
pleads guilty in
pie-in-face case
A college student has pleaded
guilty to assaulting Michigan Sen.
Carl Levin with an apple pie in his
face.
Ahlam Mohsen, a senior at
Michigan State University, said
Friday she did it as an "anti-war
statement." She and co-defendant
Max Kantar accepted plea deals
to a misdemeanor. The maximum
penaltyis ayear injail.
Levin was stuck with a pie last
summer while meeting with con-
stituents at a deli in Big Rapids.
Kantar read a statement before
Mohsen struck the Michigan
Democrat with the pie.
Mohsen's lawyer, Allison Fol-
mar, says the crust was removed
so Levin wouldn't get hurt.
Mohsen and Kantar will be sen-
tenced onJune 20 in federal court
in Grand Rapids.
TRIANGE, Va.
About 30 arrested
after protest for
Wikileaks suspect
Hundreds rallied outside a
Virginia Marine Corps base
to protest the treatment of an
imprisoned Army private sus-
pected of providing classified
data to Wikileaks.
About 30 people were arrested
yesterday at the rally protest-
ing the pretrial detention of Pfc.
Bradley Manning. About two-
dozen rallies were held around
the world.
Manning is being held in soli-
tary confinement at the Quantico
base's brig. He's confined to his
cell 23 hours a day and forced to
strip naked before bed. The mili-
tary says the conditions of his
detention are justified.
Protesters chanted "Free Brad-
ley Manning" and confronted
dozens of police officers in riot
gear outside the entrance to the
base. A short scuffle ensued. The
arrests were made after protest-
ers refused to vacate the intersec-
tion at the base entrance.
OAXACA, Mexico
Gunmen rob $13
million from
Mexican company
Mexican authorities say armed
men have stolen some 157 million
pesos from a cash transporting
company in southern Mexico.
The Oaxaca state attorney
general's office says six gunmen
wearing masks and latex gloves
broke into the Cometra facility,
subdued four guards and made
off with cash equivalent to about
$13 million.
No one was hurt in the heist
early yesterday.
The attorney general's office
says the robbers apparently wore
uniforms of Cometra workers and
drove a vehicle with the company

logo.
The statement released no
other details and it isn't clear if
authorities suspect the theft was
an inside job.
CASABLANCA, Morocco
Thousands of
Morrocans stage
political protests
Several thousand protest-
ers have staged protests in cities
around Morocco to demand more
political changes.
A group of protesters in the
commercial capital Casablanca
clashed briefly with pro-govern-
ment activists who arrived at the
end of a demonstration.
The protests were organized by
the February 20 movement, which
has led protests for the past month,
with support from Morocco's best-
known Islamist movement, Adl
wal Ihsan, which is barred from
politics in the kingdom.
The state news agency MAP
says protests were held in Fes,
Tetouan, Tangiers and other cities
and towns.

Haitians cast votes to
elect new president

Some waited up to
three hours to vote
at election polls
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
(AP) - Haitians scarred by
decades of poverty, political
corruption and natural disas-
ters cast ballots yesterday for
president in hopes a new leader
could do what others have not:
Replace homes and schools
in the earthquake-devastated
capital, improve education and
create some optimism for the
future.
Voters chose between Michel
"Sweet Micky" Martelly, a pop-
ular musician who has never
held public office, and Mirlande,
Manigat, a former first lady and
senator and longtime fixture
on the political scene. Voters
formed what for the most part
were orderly lines, some shrug-
ging off delays of three hours.
Preliminary results are expect-
ed March 31.
"A lot of governments come
through to make change for
themselves and their families,"
Jean-Claude Henry, a 43-year-
old economist, said after he
voted at a school in the Del-
mas section of Port-au-Prince,
the capital. "We want radical
change for the population."
The vote was much calmer
than the first round of voting in

November, which was marred
by disorganization, voter
intimidation and allegations of
widespread fraud. Disputed pre-
liminary results had shown gov-
ernment-backed candidate Jude
Celestin edging out Martelly for
a spot in the runoff, but under
international pressure, Haiti's
provisional electoral council
reviewed the count and elimi-
nated Celestin from the race.
Whoever wins will face
enormous challenges in a coun-
try emerging from last year's
earthquake, which the govern-
ment estimates killed more than
300,000 people. A multibillion-
dollar reconstruction effort has
stalled, and some 800,000 peo-
ple still live in the camps that
emerged around Port-au-Prince
after the quake. Compounding
the misery is a cholera outbreak
that has killed more than 4,700
people and is expected to surge
again with the rainy season.
"There is a lot of frustration,"
said 28-year-old Jazon Didier,
a computer scientist and Mani-
gat supporter. "People want a
change and a better life."
Martelly seems to have cap-
tured the ardor of young jobless
voters. Hundreds cheered him
wildly like the pop star he is as
he danced on the roof of an SUV
after casting his ballot across
the street from a tent encamp-
ment of people who lost homes
in the earthquake.

JEROME DELAY/AP
Libyan soldiers survey the damage to an administrative building hit by a missile late yesterday in the heart of Moammar
Gadhafi s Bab Al Azizia compound in Tripoli, Libya, early today.
Gadhafi vows 'long war' after
allied air strikes a'ainst Libya

U.S. military says
goal is to protect
civilians
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -
Moammar Gadhafi vowed
a "long war" as allied forces
launched a second night of
strikes on Libya yesterday, and
jubilant rebels who only a day
before were in danger of being
crushed by his forces now boast-
ed they would bring him down.
The U.S. military said the inter-
national assault would hit any
Gadhafi forces on the ground
that are attacking the opposition.
The U.S. military said the
bombardment so far - a rain of
Tomahawk cruise missiles and
precision bombs from Ameri-
can and European aircraft,
including long-range stealth
B-2 bombers - had succeeded
in heavily degrading Gadhafi's
air defenses.
The international campaign
went beyond hitting anti-airca-
ft sites. U.S., British and French
planes blasted a line of tanks
that had been moving on the
rebel capital Benghazi, in the
opposition-held eastern half of
the country. Yesterday, at least
seven demolished tanks smol-
dered in a field 12 miles (20
kilometers) south of Benghazi,
many of them with their turrets
and treads blown off, alongside
charred armored personnel car-
riers, jeeps and SUVs of the kind
used by Gadhafi fighters.
A building in Gadhafi's
compound was hit and badly
damaged late yesterday. An
Associated Press photogra-
pher at the scene said half of
the round, three-story building
was knocked down, and smoke
was rising from it. About 300
Gadhafi supporters were in the
compound at the time. It was
not known if any were hurt.
"I feel like in two days max
we will destroy Gadhafi," said
Ezzeldin Helwani, 35, a rebel
standing next to the smolder-

ing wreckage of an armored
personnel carrier, the air thick
with smoke and the pungent
smell of burning rubber. In a
grisly sort of battle trophy, cel-
ebrating fighters hung a severed
goat's head with a cigarette in
its mouth from the turret of one
of the gutted tanks.
The strikes that began early
yesterday gave immediate, if
temporary, relief to Benghazi,
which the day before had been
under a heavy attack that killed
at least 120 people. The city's
calm yesterday highlighted the
dramatic turnaround that the
allied strikes bring to Libya's
month-old upheaval: For the
past 10 days, Gadhafi's forces
had been on a triumphant offen-
sive against the rebel-held east,
driving opposition fighters back
with the overwhelming fire-
power of tanks, artillery, war-
planes and warships.
Now Gadhafi's forces are
potential targets for U.S. and
European strikes. The U.N.
resolution authorizing interna-
tional military action in Libya
not only sets up a no-fly zone but
allows "all necessary measures"
to prevent attacks on civilians.
But the U.S. military, for the
time being at the lead of the
international campaign, is try-
ing to walk a fine line over the
end game of the assault. It is
avoiding for now any appear-
ance that it aims to take out
Gadhafi or help the rebels oust
him, instead limiting its stated
goals to protecting civilians.
At the Pentagon, Navy Vice
Adm. William E. Gortney
underlined that strikes are not
specifically targeting the Lib-
yan leader or his residence in
Tripoli. He said that anyof Gad-
hafi's ground forces advancing
on the rebels were open targets.
"If they are moving on oppo-
sition forces ... yes, we will take
them under attack," he told
reporters.
"We judge these strikes to
have been very effective in sig-
nificantly degrading the regime's

air defense capability," Gortney
said. "We believe his forces are
under significant stress and suf-
fering from both isolation and a
good deal of confusion."
A military official said Air
Force B-2 stealth bombers
flew 25 hours in a round trip
from Whiteman Air Force Base
in Missouri and dropped 45
2,000-pound bombs.
What happens if rebel forces
eventually go on the offen-
sive against Gadhafi's troops
remains unclear. Gortney
would not say whether strikes
would hit Libyan troops fight-
ing back against rebel assaults.
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert
Gates said late yesterday that the
U.S. expects turn over control of
the operation to a coalition head-
ed by France, Britain or NATO
"in a matter of days," reflecting
concern that the U.S. military
was stretched thin by its current
missions. Turkey was blocking
NATO action, which requires
agreement by all 28 members of
the alliance.
Danish Defense Minister Gitte
Lillelund Bech confirmed to The
Associated Press that four Dan-
ish F-16s took part in missions
over Libya yesterday. "We are
using military means, but there
are also a lot of other means we
can use to make sure that Gad-
hafi will not be running Libya in
the future," she said.
Yesterday night, heavy anti-
aircraft fire erupted repeat-
edly in the capital, Tripoli, with
arcs of red tracer bullets and
exploding shells in the dark sky
- marking the start of a second
night of international strikes.
Gadhafi supporters in the
streets shot automatic weapons
in the air in a show of defiance.
It was not immediately known
what was being targeted in the
new strikes.
Libyan army spokesman Col.
Milad al-Fokhi said Libyan army
units had been ordered to cease
fire at 9 p.m. local time, but the
hour passed with no letup in
military activity.

North Korea warns South,
U.S. after border incident

Pyongyang alleges
that U.S. monitored
North activity
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -
North Korea has warned South
Korea of deadly consequences for
allegedly allowing U.S. troops to
come close to the countries' tense
border for reconnaissance mis-
sions and to commit provocative
acts such as taking photos with
women and drinking there.
South Korea's Defense Min-
istry and the American-led U.N.
Command - which oversees an
armistice that ended the Korean
War in the 1950s - dismissed the
accusation as groundless. They
were "not true" and the North
made similar accusations in the
past, U.N. Command spokesman
Kim Yong-kyu said.
The U.N. Command has juris-
diction over the demilitarized
zone and command troops have
only patrolled along the Korean
demilitarized zone, Kim and
South Korean Defense Ministry

officials said.
North Korea's conveyed the
warning to South Korea yes-
terday, accusing. Seoul of per-
mitting "the U.S. imperialist
aggressor troops" to come as
close as some 65 feet (20 meters)
from the border to monitor vehi-
cle and personnel movements in
the North, according to Pyong-
yang's official Korean Central
News Agency.
A KCNA dispatch accused the
U.S. troops of bringing women to
the area and take photos togeth-
er, drinking and hurling liquor
bottles to North Korean guard
posts.
"The North side warns that it
will no longer tolerate the above-
said grave military provocation"
that could trigger unspecified
deadly retaliation, the KCNA
said.
Tension on the peninsula
sharply spiked last year after a
warship was sunk and the North
shelled a South Korean front-line
island, killing a total of 50 South
Koreans. North Korea denies it
attacked the ship.

Hitting the streets
Detroit needs more officers patrolling the city
obocop may not be the only new cop patrolling the streets of
Detroit, as there are plans to add more police officers to patrol
units in Detroit. Listed as one of the most dangerous cities in
the country, crime is a major concern for Detroit. Gary Brown, Detroit
City Council president pro tem, and Mayor Dave Bing agree - Detroit
needs to get police officers out from behind the desk and onto the
streets. Brown is proposing a plan for 600 new cops to be added to the
streets while Bing's current plan calls for about 120 more cops. These
plans to add more police officers to the streets of Detroit should be
implemented in a cost effective and efficient manner.

Of the 3,000 Detroit police officers current-
ly employed, about a quarter of that number sit
at a desk every day. These officers review com-
plaints, guard buildings and courtrooms and
fill out paperwork in addition to other stan-
dard bureaucratic work. In a city with high
crime rates like Detroit, this is not a proper
allocation of trained officers. All these tasks
can be performed without the use of a gun
or police training. Instead of actively work-
ing to make the city a safer place to live, these
officers are doing administrative tasks that a
civilian could reasonably manage.
Both Brown and Bing have presented ideas
about cutting costs and adding patrolling offi-
cers. Both plans involve employing civilians
for jobs that don't require a badge or gun. Not
only would this decrease crime, but it would
also help keep the Detroit Police Department's
budget manageable because the civilian work-
ers would have lower wages than the officers.
The goal is to decrease response times around
the city and increase the rate of criminal con-
victions without putting a financial burden on
taxpayers.
One thing that could stand in the way of
implementing these ideas is the labor union.
Bing's office is currently in collective-bargain-

ing talks with union leaders. While it's impor-
tant to respect union rights and recognize the
importance of collective bargaining, the union
leaders need to work with the city to ensure
that decisions are being made to ensure safety
and also fiscal responsibility.
According to Bing's office, he hasn't heard
anything from Brown about working on this
project. The two offices appear to have inde-
pendently developed their ideas, but they
should work together and implement a plan
that will increase the number of cops on
Detroit streets.
Any plan that increases the number ofDetroit
police officerswill be a valuable change, as long
as it doesn't impact the budget of an already
overburdened city. Hiring citizens to do tasks
that don't require police training, instead of
placing trained officers behind desks, is an
excellent way to maintain the current budget
and expand the police force. Detroit needs to
work with the resources it has and allocate the
budget in the most efficient way.
On April 12, Bing will reveal his budget for
2011-2012. Those involved in formulating the
plan need to implement a law enforcement
system that increases patrolling officers and
remains within a reasonable budget.

A s a good friend described it
to me the other day, you'd
think that NBA Allstar
Grant Hill was
running to be
the first black
Republican sen-
ator from Ari-
zona.
ESPN's recent
documentary on
the "Fab Five"y
Michigan bas- NEILL
ketball teams of MOHAMMAD
the early 1990s
was unchar-
acteristically candid. The keenest
example was former University bas-
ketball player and NBA player Jalen
Rose's admission that, as a 17-year-
old prep standout from Detroit, he
was jealous of players like Grant
Hill, who came from conspicuously
wealthier backgrounds than his own.
In his mind, that disparity explained
why Hill was recruited heavily by
traditional power programs like the
one led by Mike Krzyzewski at Duke.
That would have passed without
incident except Rose also admitted
that at that age he thought that black
players like Hill, who went to places
like Duke, were "Uncle Toms."
I'm less interested in Rose's use of
that phrase than I am in the reaction
it produced. Aside from the imme-
diate chatter between the various
talking heads of the extended ESPN
media empire, Hill himself respond-
ed with a1,000word online op-ed for
The New York Times. It was paean
to hard work, bands of brothers and
- with a wholly unnecessary Latin
proverb - the value of character,
struggle and self-improvement. It
read like the flimsy, would-be Hora-
tio Alger political autobiographies
that always wash up in bookstores
during presidential election years.
It was breathtakingly inane. But in
his rush to claim what he must have
seen as the moral high ground, Hill

made anugly subtext ofbig-time col-
lege sports explicit; in doing so, he
inadvertently proved Rose's point.
College sports - big-time sports
like Big Ten and Atlantic Coast con-
ference men's basketball - have
always embraced hard work as the
ultimate arbiter between success and
failure. You can see it everywhere
during this time of the year: March
Madness's fundamental appeal is
the idea that plucky upstarts can do
anything they put their mind to so
long as they work hard, pull them-
selves up by their own bootstraps
and confirm their dedication to the
pursuit of excellence. Fans love this
sort of thing, which is why people
like Krzyzewski and the late John
Wooden - whose "Pyramid of Suc-
cess" can be found ironed to the
jerseys of this year's University of
California, Los Angeles Bruins - can
transcend the relatively pedestrian
job title of "coach" in favor of some-
thing like "leader of men." The dif-
ference between success and failure
reduces to whether 'Field Marshal'
Wooden can instill enough "self-con-
trol," "industriousness" and "loyalty"
in you before tip-off. Krzyzewski is a
latter-day George S. Patton; Duke's
Cameron Indoor Stadium is his Nor-
mandy. He'll even tell you as much in
his American Express commercial.
Embracing and extending this
attitude are the alumni who watch
the games, buy the merchandise
and, for a select few, write the lucra-
tive checks that support the larg-
est and most successful programs.
Many of:them feel very passionate
about the importance of;:"playing
the right way" and believe strongly
in the Krzyzewski party line that
moral rightness is the secret to suc-
cess. This allows people to start say-
ing some very strange things about
certain kinds of athletes under the
premise that they're just defending
the integrity of the game. Cue the
Rose-produced "Fab 5," which found

footage of no less an ambassador
of the game than basketball broad-
caster Dick Vitale grimly wringing
his hands about the kind of message
that the Fab Five were sending vul-
nerable American youth by wearing
baggy shorts and listening to N.W.A.
Allegedly serious and responsible
people use their concern for the
game as a cudgel to label certain
players - players with family histo-
ries that look much more like Jalen
Rose's than Grant Hill's - as mal-
contents, unsuitable for the leading
lights of the sport-like Duke. That,
essentially, is the polished, up-mar-
ket version of the Fab Five hate mail
that was arriving in Ann Arbor by
the wheelbarrow load in 1992.
'Fab Five' took *
a candid look at
NCAA basketball.
That was Rose's argument, as he
went on to explain to sports writ-
er Skip Bayless (a man who once
argued with a straight face that
interracial marriages are a plus for
black football coaches who want jobs
with programs in the Deep South)
in a separate television appearance.
Coaches and programs have to cater
to their benefactors, and some fan
bases have little interest in recruits
like Rose for reasons that have little
to do with basketball.
It's great that Hill views himself
and his family as decent, hard-work-
ing people. What would be better is
if he entertained the idea that Rose
worked hard too, but only one of
them was ever going to get a visit
from Coach K.

Rock the MSA) vote

As the world watched the mass destruc-
tion caused by the tragic earthquake in Japan,
manythoughtthatnit couldn'tget anyworse for
the Japanese people. Unfortunately, the earth-
quake had damaged multiple nuclear power
plants, and apparently the authorities couldn't
control the leaks of radiation. While we all
watched the news looking for any glimmer of
hope for the thousands of displaced victims,
oil executives were overcome with joy: They
had won again.
America has 104 nuclear power plants
that supply approximately 19.6 percent of the
nation's energy, according to the U.S. Energy'
Information Administration. While this num-
ber may seem large, understand that no new
nuclear power plant has been built in America
since 1974. Since the catastrophes of Cher-
nobyl and Three Mile Island, Americans have
been convinced that nuclear power is unsafe
and inevitably leads to disaster. As gas prices
have soared and technology has improved,
nuclear energy has once again grown popular
in recent years. In fact, both Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.) and President Barack Obama were
strong advocates for new nuclear energy
plants during their respective campaigns in
2008. It appeared that nuclear energy was
finally making a comeback when Obama made
it clear that the construction of new nuclear
power plants was one of his main goals during
his first term as president.
In 2009, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission had received applications for per-
mission to construct 26 new nuclear power
reactors. ThiswasfollowedbyObama's approv-
al for loans guaranteeing as many as 20 new
nuclear reactors. Long overdue, it appeared
that America could finally make some steps
toward reducingour dependence on oil.
However, as the old adage goes, all good
things must come to an end. Americans have
begun to see the terrifying footage of uncon-
trollable nuclear reactors in the wake of
the Japanese disaster. In recent days, many
politicians, who had finally agreed upon a
bipartisan energy bill, have begun to retract
their support for nuclear power. This piece

of legislation, considered a major milestone
in America's dealing with the problems of oil
dependency and climate change, appears that
it may be halted indefinitely due to the obser-
vations made in light of Japan's current chal-
lenges. The inevitable death of this bill is an
absurd overreaction that will have far-reach-
ing effects on the future of America's energy
capabilities.
We as Americans cannot look at Japan as an
example of nuclear power crisis, but instead
learn from the tragedy and develop ways to
prohibit such a catastrophe here in America.
Oil companies will do everything in their
powerto ensure that fear concerning anything
to do with nuclear power is inflicted into the
public. In 2009 alone, oil and gas companies
spent approximately $180 million on political
lobbyists and millions more on political con-
tributions to various politicians, according to
OpenSecrets.org. We cannot let these greedy
and self-driven companies simply buyout our
government and prohibit us from creating
sensible energy reform that could better pro-
tect our environment, reduce carbon emis-
sions and finally allow America to reduce its
dependence on oil.
As we have learned due to the Deepwater
Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico last
summer and the recent turmoil in the Middle
East, oil is no longer a stable commodity that
our economy can rely on. By continuing our
dependence on oil, we're empowering undem-
ocratic foreign leaders, inevitably funding
terrorist organizations and destroying our
environment. We must seek alternative ener-
gies to eventually replace our need for oil:
Nuclear energy is undoubtedlythe best option.
The tragedy of Japan's recent earthquake is
one that will remain in our hearts for years to
come. We must help rebuild Japan and learn
how we can better protect ourselves from such
a disaster. Overreacting and ending any plans
for nuclear expansion in America would be a
terrible response and one that we as citizens
must ensure doesn't happen.

On the first day of Welcome Week freshman year, the
world is full of possibilities. For many students, coming
to college symbolizes the end of one stage of life and the
beginning of another - one based on new experiences
that inspire both excitement and fear. Yet what we may
not have realized at first is that the moment our feet hit
campus, a clock begins to tick. In truth, we have only a
few short years to make our impact on the University of
Michigan before we must pass along our legacy to the
next generation of Wolverines.
In some ways, college can feel simply like a transi-
tion. It's the period of time that connects us from a past,
shaped by the households and high schools from which
we came, to a future shaped by our own goals and ambi-
tion. Although it can sometimes be difficult, within this
dichotomy of past and future, it's crucial that we remain
conscious of and actively engage in the present, espe-
cially in issues whose consequences reach beyond any
one individual.
As students at the University, we have a wealth of
resources at our fingertips. These resources come
in many forms and can be furnished as tools to help
further any cause. MForward is a Michigan Student
Assembly party formed on the principle of fostering
a diverse and active student body, one whose needs
and interests vary greatly and add to the energy of the
campus community. The current candidates, including
myself, hope to preserve this above all else as advo-
cates and facilitators of student activism. From MFor-
ward's perspective, our most important resources are
each other.
Advocacy, however, especially as defined in the con-
text of student government, depends upon a foundation
of engagement from those who participate in and benefit
from it. Engagement in this democratic process, in turn,
depends upon the simplest, easiest and most important
form of involvement. Yes, I'm referring to voting.
As the former chair of the University's chapter of
College Democrats, I'm sure many of you have seen me
chasing students across the Diag in order to make sure
that they are registered to vote. Perhaps you yourself
have suffered through the 30-second tutorial of how to
fill out the form or were asked repeatedly if you knew the

exact location of your polling place. Needless to say, I've
always had a strong commitment to making sure that
students have a voice in choosing everyone who repre-
sents them, and when I say everyone, I mean it.
Everyone includes your representatives on MSA. The
online polling site makes voting for your peers even eas-
ier than voting in government elections. With two days
to fill out your ballot, there is really no excuse not to click
onto the voting page and check the names of the people
who you believe will be best for the job.
With little to no cost to yourself, you can make your
voice heard in a deliberation that absolutely will affect
your campus experience. MSA works more closely with
students than any other governing body, and it offers a
direct connection between students and the Univer-
sity administration. It not only can create policies that
reflect your needs but can also serve as a forum for your
own causes. If you feel that it fails to accomplish this,
then your first step in improving MSA is voting for the
members who compose it.
Thus, casting your vote isn't merely a means to show
confidence toward those you choose on the ballot. More
importantly, it's a means of holding them accountable.
It's the basis on which any of their actions (or inactions)
may be exposed and challenged. Not voting means that
you've opted out of this process altogether.
Information about all those running for a position is
also online, and within minutes you can learn enough
about each of the candidates of your school to make an
educated decision. Platforms for all those running with
the MForward Party can be easily accessed at www.
MForward.org.
While I do hope that you vote for MForward and the
values that we represent, most importantly, I want you
to vote. Period. Electionsbegin on Wednesday, March 23
and run until March 24, so please spare the 10 seconds
it takes to add your voice to the campus community in
a very real way. Whether or not you realize it, these are
the types of precious seconds that will shape the collec-
tive legacy of this student body.
Campbell is the MForward vice presidential
candidate. He is an LSA junior.

his friends and family in Tokyo.
At first, Matsushima said he
wasn't sure if the images he saw
were real.
"It was really hard to take in,"
Matsushima said. "It took me a
couple of hours justto grasp what
was going on."
Matsushima said he eventual-
ly learned that his family is safe,
but was very anxious while wait-
ing for the delayed delivery time
it took for an e-mail to reach his
" mother.
In frequent communication
with his family, Matsushima said
he's learned that though they
had stocked up on rice and other
foods before the disaster, Tokyo
is now running out of food. His
family's home is also affected by
planned power outages - which
also cause a temporary loss of
heat - so that power can be
diverted to the northern part of
the country.
Though Matsushima and
people his age have experienced
earthquakes before, he said he
feels his age group was more
affected by this quake than the
older generation.
"This is the first time for all
the people my age to experience
something this devastating,"
Matsushima said.
From a young age, Matsushi-
ma said his school held earth-
quake and fire drills, but even
with this preparation, he said his
friends were still unprepared for
the level of destruction.
"The thing is, it really hap-
pens; we have earthquakes, so
we have drills," he said. "But we
actually do that in real life too."
LSA senior Kenta Hayashi,
an international student at the
University, said he also clearly
remembers drills from his kin-
dergarten class in Tokyo. Though
his family has since moved to
Taiwan, he said he has friends
and extended family in Japan,
who are safe but shaken by the
disaster. He added that amid the
initial shock, there is still civil
order and no reports of looting.
Matsushima said he believes
the reason for the lack of panic
stems from the Japanese culture
of respecting others.
"We're basically educated to
RHA

hope to establish regulations in
time for the 2012 election.
"Now we're just ready to get a
permanent policy in place, get input
9 from anyone who is interested and
t would be affected by this policy,
and move on quickly," Jones said.
Currently, only an interim policy
is in place, Jones said. Anyone liv-
ing in a residence hall is allowed to
knock on doors within that hall to
campaign for candidates or discuss
any other political issues. Jones
said this policy placed limitations
on political activities within the
residence halls during this past
November's elections since stu-
dents who don't live in a residence
hall aren't allowed to canvass in the
building.
This interim policy will expire
at the end of the semester, at
which point the residence halls

will return to the previous policy
which only allows members of the
Michigan Student Assembly or
Voice Your Vote, an MSA commis-
sion that advocates for students to
vote, to canvass in the residence
halls, Jones said. She added that the
College Democrats and the ACLU

respect other people andto think
about ourselves second and oth-
ers first," Matsushima said.
Matsushima said he has seen
this awareness of helping others
extend across Twitter feeds, with
his friends re-tweeting basic first
aid and emergency information.
In Kyoto, people of all ages
are bucketing to raise money for
those affected by the disaster,
Resnick said. She said she the
city has seen an influx of people
seekingrefuge from the radiation
and lack of food in the northeast.
These refugees are almost indis-
tinguishable from Kyoto citizens,
Resnick said.
"Sometimes it's hard to tell
them apart from ordinary people
because they don't look any dif-
ferent," she said. "They act the
same; it's just that they're here
because they feel that here's a bit
safer."
But even as students in Japan
help garner funds for the victims,
Hayashi said he and his friends
don't truly know how to help the
victims of the disaster.
"There's a lot of sense of hope-
lessness among the younger
generation because they want to
help but don't know what to do,"
Hayashi said.
He added that he believes
because the older generation
lived through the destruction of
World War II, they're able to help
younger people cope with this
disaster.
With her program canceled
and her return to Michigan on
Wednesday, Resnick said she
and others in her program wish
they could stay to help with relief
efforts. She said she still feels
safe in Kyoto, and this is an unex-
pected end to her program.
"I think we're all kind of feel-
ing shocked and wondering why
(the program is canceled)," she
said.
Resnick was part of the Kyoto
Consortium for Japanese Stud-
ies headed by Columbia Univer-
sity. However, the University
also canceled its undergraduate
study abroad program in Japan
for the semester since the U.S.
State Department issued a travel
warning to the country. The Uni-
versity has a policy not to host
international study programs
in nations that have U.S. State
Department travelwarnings.
The 10 University undergradu-
believe that a representative from
any registered student organization
should be able to campaign in the
residence halls.
"We really thought it was impor-
tant that we set upa working group
to get the ball rolling on putting
into place a better permanent poli-
cy," Jones said.
The resolution passed last week
doesn't propose a new policy, but it
does establish a working group to
discuss the situation and potential
policies, Jones said. She added that
it's important to get this dialogue
started since people were unsure
of the canvassing rules in the 2008
and 2010 elections.
Business sophomore Trevor
Grieb, president of RHA, wrote in
an e-mail interview that the asso-
ciation supports the working group
so that a permanent policy can
eventually be adopted. He added
that RHA doesn't support one pol-
icy over another.

"Some representatives wanted
no political activity in the dorms,
others welcomed as much politi-
cal activity as possible, as long as
security was still strictly managed
within the halls," Grieb wrote.
Jones said the University has
been willing to engage in discussion
about potential policies, adding

atesbstudying in Japan are com-
ing back to the United States and
will be able to enroll in classes in
Ann Arbor, according to Fitzger-
ald. The six University graduate
students who are also in Japan
this semester will decide inde-
pendently whether to stay in
Japan or return to the United
States, he said.
Resnick said the prevailing
feeling in Kyoto is that the coun-
try will recover from the devas-
tation.
"I think that now the main
feeling is a sense of we can
rebuild and there is hope," she
said.
Here in Ann Arbor, Hayashi
said the Japan Student Associa-
tion - of which he is internal vice
president and Matsushima is a
member - painted the rock with
the phrase "Pray for Japan" on
Friday and is making wristbands
and T-shirts to fundraise money
for the Red Cross in Japan. The
group is also fundraising by mak-
ing origami cranes and area busi-
nesses have agreed to give money
to the group for every 1,000
cranes they create.
But even with these efforts and
his own donations, Hayashi said
he wishes he could do more. He
added that he felt strange on St.
Patrick's Day amid the celebra-
tions in Ann Arbor while people
in Japan were suffering.
Though Matsushima's mid-
term studying was affected by
constantly monitoring the situa-
tion, he said he and many of his
friends who are studying abroad
at other universities outside
Japan feel guilty about going
about their daily lives. But he said
he hopes to take the education
and skills he learns here to help
Japan when he returns in May.
"We kind of feel guilt about
us being happy and having fun,
leading ordinary lives, doing
homework, while our friends
in Japan are migrating to the
West and going to supermarkets
in search of food and trying to
donate whatever they can to the
East," Matsushima said. "We
think we kind of have to live on
and try to get whatever we (can)
from the life we're having here
because we're going back in the
future."
- The Associated Press
contributed to this report.
that ACLU decided to collaborate
with RHA to give University Hous-
ingstudent feedback.
"They really wanted input from
RHA since that is the organization
that represents students living in
the residence halls," she said.
University Housing spokesman
Peter Logan wrote in an e-mail
interview that the residence halls
are seen as the private homes of
students living in them.
"University Housing has not
allowed open access to the halls for
door-to-door canvassing because
it would compromise the privacy
and security of the residents - not
unlike someone enteringyour home
and knocking on your bedroom
door to advocate a candidate, an
organization or a cause," he wrote.
University Housing isn't push-
ing for a particular policy in the
working group and will continue
an ongoing discussion on the topic
since student opinions are valued

in the creation of Housing policies,
Logan wrote.
"We want to know what the
RHA, as representatives of our
resident students, feel is useful and
appropriate for the housing com-
munities and their residents, as
well as what would be practical for
Housingstaffto manage," he wrote.

Holocaust survivors share
their stories with students

More than 40
survivors, 250
attendees gather at
Hillel luncheon
By KIMBERLY PAGEAU
Daily StaffReporter
Zygie Allweiss was only 12
years old when the Holocaust
began, but he vividly remembers
breaking stones everyday at a
labor camp in Poland and seeing
his uncle and two aunts shot in
the back of their heads by Ger-
man soldiers.
Allweiss was one of more
than 40 Holocaust survivors,
who came to tell their personal
accounts at the 4th annual Con-
ference on the Holocaust at the
University of Michigan Hillel
yesterday.
Organized by the Children of
the Holocaust Survivors Asso-
ciation of Michigan and the
University's Hillel, the confer-
ence had 250 guests, who were
assigned to sit at tables where
the survivors individually
shared their experiences during
World War II. After the confer-
ence, students were asked to sign
a pledge to tell the survivor's
story in 2045 - the 100th anni-

versary of the liberation of the
Auschwitz concentration camp.
LSA junior Haley Volk, a
co-chair of the event, said she
decided to get involved with
Holocaust commemoration
because her grandparents were
survivors. In high school, she
worked with her grandmother
to record and her grandparents'
experiences.
"When my grandfather
passed away, we realized that
nobody had ever recorded his
story," she said.
Volk said she thinks it's
important for students to hear
the stories firsthand from a sur-
vivor instead of simply learning
the facts about the Holocaust.
"It's one thing to read it in a
textbook, but it's another thing
to hear it firsthand and to hear
it from the person who actu-
ally experienced it," Volk said.
"While we have the opportu-
nity, while the survivors are still
alive, we should definitely take
advantage of that."
Another survivor who spoke
to a table of students at yester-
day's event, Gerry Kraus, was 6
years old when the war began.
Born in Berlin, Kraus spent
the duration of the war hiding
from Nazis. Initially, he stayed
with relatives living near Berlin
but had to leave after a Nazi SS

officer moved in with them. He
spent the remainder of the war
living in various bombed out
buildings, he told the group.
"By my wits and some good
fortune I managed to survive
living in and around Berlin," he
said.
He said even after the con-
clusion of the war, he struggled
with reliving the past and had
difficulty moving on.
"I have been torn between
wanting to go on with life and
leaving the past behind me and
feeling an obligation to those
that survived," he told the table
of attendees.
Mark Webber told the stu-
dentsat his table the story of how
he escaped to Russia to avoid the
war. He recounted dealing with
the remnants of anti-Semitism
in Poland, which led to the mur-
der of his parents a year after the
close of WWII.
LSA freshman Natasha Nanus
said the survivor she spoke with
emphasized the importance of
valuing your life and others'
lives.
"Our survivor stressed that
we are all individuals and that
we have to take our lives into
our own hands," Nanus said.
"We have to make a promise to
ourselves not to hurt any other
human being."


POWWOW
From Page 1A
Pasfield, a senior member of
the powwow committee and a
member of the Bay Mills Tribe,
said in an interview before the
event that she enjoys the pow-
wow because of its ability to
bring people together.
"To see people from differ-
ent nations, different tribes and
different parts of the country
is the most special part ..." Pas-
field said. "No matter what's
going on at the campus or in
life, Native (American) stu-
dents at the University of Mich-
igan can be counted on toput on
this really incredible powwow
for the community, bringing
people together under a com-
mon cause."
At the event, dancers moved
in circles formed around
drums Pasfield compared to
"the size of a standard dining
room table." She said every
movement made during the
course of the powwow, includ-
ing the dancers' circular
motions, is symbolic and rep-
resentative of a larger cultural
theme. The dancer's circular
motions represent the circle
of life, a thematic element in
Native American culture,
Pasfield said. Even the direc-
tion from which the dancers
entered the circular arena, the
east, is derived from the direc-
tion in which the sun rises
every morning.
Yvonne Moore, a longtime
powwow attendee, said the
drummers live a life free of
alcohol, drugs and adultery
because when they play their
drums, they pay homage to
the Earth and to their cul-
tural roots.
Aside from the artistic
displays, two issues arose
throughout the course of
the event - racism against

Native Americans today and
the tension that exists between
the University and NASA.
Representatives from the
Michigan Coalition Against
Racism in Sports and Media
had a table displaying various
Native American racial slurs
in common products and the
media today - like how sports
teams frequently use the name
"Redskins." The organization
sends memos to school boards
and regents of various universi-
ties, requesting that the derog-
atory slogans, mascots and
imagery be removed, according
to Todd Linder, a member of the
organization.
Though the University held
the event for many years at
Crisler Arena the powwow
moved to Saline Middle School
three years ago.
Rick Schott, a longtime
Mother Earth Powwow secu-
rity and event coordinator,
said one of the reasons for the
venue change was due to ten-
sions stemming from the Uni-
versity's policy of requiring
tribes to provide evidence of
ownership or affiliation with
the artifacts in the Univer-
sity's Exhibit Natural History
Museum in order for them to
be returned to the tribes. Fol-
lowing the Native American
Graves Protection and Repa-
triation Act, which was cre-
ated in 1990 and updated in
March 2010, institutions that
receive federal funding are
required to return Native
American artifacts to their
original owners.
Schott said the University's
process of requiring proof of
affiliation "upsets and saddens"

him because he thinks many
tribes cannot meet the Univer-
sity's requirement.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald wrote in an e-mail
interview that the Univer-
sity has a "moratorium" on
any research with NAGPRA
remains and has contact-
ed tribes affiliated with the
objects still in the University's
possession to inform them of
their possible claims. While
waiting for a response from
tribes, Fitzgerald wrote that
the University will hold onto
the objects in a "ritually appro-
priate way."
LSA junior Alys Alley, who is
a member of the Pokagon Band
of Potawatomi Indians and a
senior member of the powwow
committee, wrote in an e-mail
interview that she would "like
to see more institutional sup-
port from the University for
Native (American) students,
especially when it comes to
recruitment and retention."
"We are at a critical time
where our incoming classes of
Native (American) students are
getting smaller and smaller,
and I hope that this problem
can gain more attention and
resources from the University,"
Alley wrote.
Despite the politics and
change in locations, Martin
said the powwow is stilla mem-
orable and enriching experi-
ence.
"It is one of the greatest days
of the year, and something
everyone should experience
in their life, whether Native
American or not," Martin said.
"After 39 years, it is just as spe-
cial now as it was on day one."

JENNINGS
From Page 1A
a rude awakening, paralyzing the.
brain. The silence that over took
Tim Hardaway Jr. as he looked
up at the scoreboard and bit at his
uniform to fight back the tears.
Yes, the scoreboard read cor-
rectly, Duke won, 73-71.
"Everything went blank," Hard-
away Jr. would say after the game.
He heard nothing. Thousands
of Duke fans screamed as Mike
Krzyzewski notched his 900th
win, but Hardaway Jr. heard
silence.
Then there was the silence of
Jonathan Kirbitz packing up his
drum set for the last time. For
four years, he's been the Michigan
pep band's drummer, but when
that ding came, his career ended.
The band director looked up at his
band and asked the seniors to lead
the group for their final round of
"The Victors."
Kirbitz is graduating in May
and doesn't know what he'll do.
He wants to continue playing
music, he says, but it won't be for
Michigan. Unlike every member
of the Michigan basketball team,
he won't return.
His career ended the moment
that silence did.
And then there was the
moment no one saw when Lauren
McLaughlin meticulously placed a

sticker reading 'Duke' as the win-
ner on the bracketnthat hung out-
side the arena. It was a placard that
represented the Wolverines' defeat
- perhaps the first physical mani-
festation of the loss. She attached
the sticker and said nothing.
Perhaps she expected to put
the Blue Devils' name there, like
so many others, but the NCAA
had printed up Michigan's sticker
as well.
She wouldn't need to use it. She
carelessly threw it into the trash.
There was no rebound. That shot
was perfect and the crumbled
sticker lay unused and silent in
the bottom of the can.
Right now that sound is the
silence that filled Zack Novak's
heart as he stood at midcourt
coming to the realization that his
junior season was over.
It's the worst feeling in the
world, like someone died, he'd say.
And then there was the silence
of the arena after the game, as
Morris reemerged from the locker
room and walked onto the court
where his season had ended less
than an hour before.
A handful of reporters and
maintenance workers fell quiet.
He looked at no one and walked
across mid-court towards the bas-
ket that may haunt him until next
season. With an invisible ball, he
reattempted that shot.
His right hand, with perfect
form, glided through the empty

space. His headphones jiggled
around his neck. He jumped off
his right foot and landed again.
Silence.
But the sound of the pros-
pects of nextyear's team roared
throughoutthe arena. A team that
will lose no one. A team that will
return with a chip on its shoulder.
A team that will no longer have a
target on its heart, but rather, on
its back.
And then a voice from the
upper deck broke that silence, just
like that ding broke the silence of
the ball rushingthose the air.
"Keep your head up."
Morris looked up and contin-
ued walking.
It will be what this team needs
to do. Because for now, there will
be silence and it will be a painful
silence. It will be the sound of
people not knowing what to say.
Whether to apologize or congrat-
ulate a team thatnbrought Michi-
gan basketball out of irrelevance,
if only for a few weeks.
It willbe a silence that repre-
sents the end of a hopeful season
and a quiet March for the Wolver-
ines.
Morris won't get that shot back.
But on Thursday or Friday,
they'll be back in the gym again.
And that silence that represented
so much, yet held nothing, will
be filled with sounds of a team
preparingto do work again next
season.

GEO
From Page 1A
that the union was pleased to
get a deal done.
"As the bargaining team went
into bargaining on Friday with
new proposals, we had no idea
that we would sign a tentative
agreement 13 hours later at 2
in the morning," Echols wrote.
"The University's team was
eager to conclude negotiations
when they learned that GEO
members had decided not to
extend the contract a second
time earlier last week."
Gillezeau wrote that the sign-
ing of the tentative agreement is
evidence of the power of collec-
tive bargaining.
"The union and the Univer-
sity were able to come together
at the table and reach an agree-
ment that addresses significant
problems facing employees with
disabilities, parents, interna-
tional students and others," he
wrote.
Under the tentative agree-
ment, GEO members will
receive more accommodations
for disabled employees, which
Gillezeau called "historic."
The 1,800-member union
represents all University grad-
uate student instructors and
graduate student staff assis-
tants. The tentative agreement

sets wage increases for GEO
members over the three years
covered by the contract at 2.5
percent, 3 percent and 3 percent,
respectively.
In the new contract, mem-
bers will also receive increased
childcare subsidies and access
to lactation spaces. GEO will
also have three representatives
on a six-person committee to
evaluate the University's cur-
rent spousal work and study
requirements for child care sub-
sidies.
Several new employee ben-
efits will also be included in the
contract, including the estab-
lishment of a job posting web-
site for GSIs and GSSAs and the
elimination of mandatory group
work hours after 1 a.m.
More details of the agree-
ment will be made public after
the ratification vote by GEO's
general membership, accord-
ing to a University press release
made public today.
Gillezeau wrote that the bar-
gaining team is "thrilled with
this outcome." GEO and the
University reached an agree-
ment without a strike for the
first time in 20 years, he wrote.
"This is how collective bar-
gaining is supposed to work,
and we hope that this sets a new
standard for our relationship
with the University," Gillezeau
wrote.

Ronald Dick, associate
director of Academic Human
Resources at the University,
wrote in the press release that
the tentative agreement signi-
fies constructive cooperation
between GEO and the Univer-
sity.
"With this agreement we
were able to work together to
pave the way for timely and
effective accommodations for
graduate students with disabili-
ties in need of accommodations
to fulfill their responsibilities
as graduate student instructors
or graduate student staff assis-
tants," Dick wrote.
While members of GEO and
University representatives
expressed overall satisfaction
with the tentative agreement,
some issues GEO members
have been lobbying for - like
the inclusion of GSRAs under
GEO's contract and the reduc-
tion of prescription co-pays
- weren't included in the new
contract.
However, Gillezeau wrote
that the tentative agreement
addresses an impressive num-
ber of issues considering the
current political and economic
situation in Michigan.
After a vote by GEO's general
membership on Wednesday,
the agreement will be brought
before the University's Board of
Regents for approval.

Seven albums A

Iremember

ou could call these
albums that "changed"
me, but that would be
a comforting lie. You could
call them "meaningful," but
that sounds
awfully pre-
cious. You
couldn't
call them
"perfect."
You couldn't
call them all
"classics" JOE
either. What- DIMUZIO
ever they are
to me doesn't
need scare-quotes and changes
every minute. So here's a snap-
shot of seven, meaningless,
flawed, non-affecting memories,
in no particular order.
Linkin Park
Meteora
This is the first CD I ever
bought, played extensively on
a new, blue Sony CD Walkman
and identified with in ways I
can't remember. A friend in sixth
grade tipped me to Reanimation
and I'd heard "Crawling," feeling
aimless and angry at nothing.
Rapping and safely headbanging
Park became my band. I once
played it for my mom and sister
on the way to church and they
weren't annoyed or angered,
just bored. The very first time I
clacked it and put on my head-
phones, my Uncle Rich was
in the car and he rattled, "Oh
you've got your own little music
player there?" I mumbled yes, sat
glass-eyed to "Don't Stay" and
realized three minutes later that
he was still talking to me. I wish
I had listened to him.
Various Artists
MTV2Neadbangers Ball Vol. 2
At some point in seventh
grade I decided I was "lonely,"
maybe even "edgy," and the
hard-rocking bits of Linkin
' Park were important. Without
any research or recommenda-
tion, I somehow decided that
the logical next step for me was
MTV2's Headbanger's Ball Vol. 2.
I dropped 12 dollars at F.Y.E. (a
pretty cool place, I thought) and
realized everything that I was
not. I couldn't tell you a single
thing about the whole set except
for my response to it, which was
shame, regret and selling it to a
kid who liked Cradle of Filth a
lot. I'm still nursing my "metal"
wounds with Sabbath and Sleep.
Aretha Franklin
Young, Gifted andBlack
Aretha is one of a stable of
established artists in American
pop whose reputation has been
reduced to vague canoniza-
tion. Ask any 20-something
why Aretha's great and you're
not getting much of an answer.
Young, Gifted and Black is one
of many reasons. Coasting away
from her early smashes with
Atlantic, the '60s crumbled and
1972's Black flirts with opulence,
funking harder than Motown
ever could. It features Aretha
doing what she does best, which
on this album, is just about every
damn thing. Wailing, piano-
playing, song-writing ... if you're
making a case for emotion as

authenticity, then give this or
Amazing Grace - an album
so converted it will make the
secular believe -10 spins. These
albums make me vulnerable to
things.
William Basinski
The Disintegration Loops I-IV
(but mostly I)
When ambient's too busy
and found-sound's too dull, The
Disintegration Loops are my
bedtime records of choice. The
backstory on these is irresistible.
Basinski transferred some old
seconds-long tape loops to digi-
tal, realizing that as they spun,
the magnetic strip that kept
them alive fell off. As recorded,
the loops begin and fade into
ether, some over the course of
10 minutes, others over an hour.

After finishingthe project,
Basinski claims he just happened
to listen to it with his friends on
his Brooklyn roof on a certain
second Tuesday in September
of 2001. Even if that story isn't
true, these loops have a hell of a
lot more to say than ferrite fall-
ing off a plastic tape.
Various Artists
A Tom Moulton Mix Vol.1 and2
This is the beginning of a
never-end for me. The document
that taught me the joys of the
extended cut and the power of a
producer who can makea great
song transcendent by under-
standing everything that ever
made it good. Disco at the hands
of Tom Moulton is like day-old
chili made with hundred-year
old wine - the longer it sits the
better, and it ages beautifully.
From Linkin
Park to Prince
and in between.
The man turns Eddie Kend-
ricks's "Keep On Truckin"' into
a reflection of life and death, B.T.
Express's "Peace Pipe" from a
bumper-sticker peace slogan into
hippie fury and Grace Jones's
"La Vie En Rose" coldness to
bleeding-heart freezer-burn.
And hey, you can dance to it all.
Prince
Sign 'o the Times
My ex used to tell me that my
singing in the car was endearing.
Sign 'o the Times is the album
that would strip that lie. Seeing
Purple Rain in high school con-
verted me to his monarchy and
Sign is the moment he entered
my bloodstream. I have iton
cassette, vinyl and CD. I need it
wherever I go. It is a drugthat I
will never quit, even if my family
and friends don't understand. I
need it to live.
Harry Nilsson
Nilsson Schmilsson
I asked my father if he was a
Nilsson fan and the night ended
with me realizing he knew Nils-
son Schmilsson, back-to-front,
better than I did. Thirty-five
minutes and 17 seconds in heav-
en, that night, this album.

Re-released 'Evil' is beyond good
By Shin Hieftje I Daily Arts Writer

A re-release usually doesn't
mark anything important. It's
typically a piece of entertainment
that many have
seen before, ****
so "who real-
ly cares?" is Beyond Good
the general and Evil HD
response. Yet
"Beyond Good XBox Live
and Evil HD," Arcade
a high-defini-
tion remake of Ubisoft
a 2003 game,
feels notable for a number of rea-
sons. For one, it's a game that very
few people played or were aware
of at the time of its release, so it
will feel totally new for many. Sec-
ondly - and perhaps this shows
how risk-adverse today's indus-
try is - "Beyond Good and Evil
HD" incorporates many different
gameplaytypes in a way that can't
be found in other moderngames.
Players take the role of Jade,
a female photojournalist living
on the once-peaceful planet of
Hillys. An alien threat has slowly
been abducting citizens to a lunar
base, and Jade finds out that the
local military is aiding the aliens
in human trafficking rather than
fighting them off. The rest of the
game focuses on exposing this
conspiracy.
There are numerous facets to
the gameplay, but the basic ele-
ments are structured in a very
"Legend of Zelda"-type fashion.
Massive structures, like a slaugh-

terhouse in which the victims
are being shipped to space, serve
as dungeons would in "Legend
of Zelda," in which players often
enter a room and have to solve an
environmental puzzle or defeat
enemies in order to proceed. In
"Beyond Good and Evil HD" solv-
ing puzzles requires astute obser-
vations of the surrounding area,
critical thinking and sometimes
some platforming. Fighting ene-
mies involves simple one-button
melee combat with Jade's wood-
en staff. There's also a projectile

looks pretty damn good in HD.
Obviously the textures are not as
detailed as moderngames, but the
colors are rich and vibrant and the
game has a nice, clean presenta-
tion. The sound design is average,
but the music, especially late in
the game, provides an appropriate
amount of dramatic tension for
the gravitas of the situation.
"Beyond Good and Evil HD" is
essentially a full retail experience
for 10 dollars. The campaign runs
about 12 hours, perhaps shorter if
players don't take part in any of
the side missions. While it is a re-
release, somehow this re-release
feels unique in a field of modern
games that stick to safe, tried-
and-true gameplay formulas. It's
clear that a lot of care went into
creating the story and gameplay
elements to work in tandem.
Those looking for a well-crafted
(albeit dated) game should defi-
nitely check it out.

FIlM NOTEBOOK
Clooney charms 'U'

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com
ALBUM REVIEW
Noah wails about love

An 'Ides of March'
extra describes
the experience
By KELLY ETZ
For theDaily
George Clooney isn't your
average celebrity. He's no cast
member of "Jersey Shore" - he's
a major celebrity to everyone.
When you see Clooney in person,,
it's big. That's a name you can
brag about. And when given the
opportunity to be in his movie,
you don't hesitate. Clooney waits
for no man.
So I, of course, jumped at
the chance to be an extra in the
upcoming "The Ides of March,"
a political-thriller - very Cloo-
ney - rife with idealistic report-
ers and dirty politics. Clooney is
all over this film, from writing
the screenplay, to directing, to
starring as the corrupt Gover-
nor Mike Morris. The film also
stars Ryan Gosling ("Blue Valen-
tine"), Phillip Seymour Hoffman
("Pirate Radio"), Marisa Tomei
("The Wrestler") and Evan
Rachel Wood ("Across the Uni-
verse") and is set to be released
in October.
In what I'm sure is to be a
pivotal scene, Governor Morris
gives a speech at a presidential
primary in Ohio. Supposedly set
on a college campus, the scene
includes yours truly along with
300 or so other extras, most of
whom are University students.
Just the idea of having Clooney
on our campus was intoxicating.
The novelty of seeing ourselves
in a Clooney film won't wear off
soon.
As extras, our task was to look
thoroughly engrossed in what
Clooney was saying, then clap
and enthusiastically wave signs
with slogans like "Morris has
Morrals." Though pretending
to be from Ohio was a definite

George Clooney wrote, directs and stars in "The Ides of March.

stretch, I'd say we really carried
the scene. The panning shots
over the crowd are sure to cause
some early Oscar buzz.
In between shooting, Cloo-
ney good-naturedly entertained
the crowd. Upon request, he
declared "Batman and Robin"
the worst movie he's ever starred
in, advising all the future actors
out there to "never do anything
in spandex." He also gracefully
endured many shoutouts from
the female members of the audi-
ence, including "George, you
sexy beast!" and "Let me take
you out tonight!" Undeterred by
these displays of affection, Cloo-
ney explained a little bit about
the movie and what exactly we,
as extras, were supposed to do,
and then thanked us for our
time. At the end of the day he
raffled off iPods, iPads, a Blu-ray
player and a flat screen TV. As if
he hadn't already won over the
crowd.
It's hard to pinpoint exactly
what makes Clooney so appeal-
ing. I was fully prepared for him
to be the polar opposite of what

he seems. He is a major celebrity,
after all. Just because he looks
handsome and dashing doesn't
automatically make him genu-
ine. But even the most cynical
would be charmed by Clooney's
repartee. Aside from an aston-
ishing number of Canadian jokes
(in jest at a member of the crew),
Clooney gave a satisfying perfor-
mance off camera as well, which
turned out to be a pleasant sur-
prise. Because, let's face it, he
could get away with being an
absolute jerk, and we'd all still
love him.
But it was clear from the first
take that Clooney isn't one of
those pretentious actor types.
Witty, charismatic and engag-
ing, Clooney more than lived up
to the hype. He looked complete-
ly at ease off camera, standing in
front of the crowd, just talking
to us. It's safe to say that Clooney
found his calling. It's also safe to
say that I'm just a teensy bit star-
struck. But who can blame me?
I dare you to spend a day with
Clooney and not come out with
stars in your eyes.

Noah and the Whale's Last
Night on Earth takes off from
the self-pity tendencies of the
folk genre and
exists as an "I **
will be happy"
record. Cleanly Noah and
produced for the Whale
the electro-pop
radio, fruity Last Night
melodies and on Earth
lyrics make the
group's third Mercury
album a perfect
match for accompanying an inspi-
rational slideshow for battling
cancer, AIDS or possibly a broken
heart, in the case of lead singer
Charlie Fink.
The curious band name comes
from the Sundance Film Festival
award-winningdrama"The Squid
and the Whale." The band adores
this Noah Baumbach-directed
film about how to grow up. This
knowledge coincides with the
group's first two folk-inspired
records but creates somewhat of
a disconnect with the sensation of
its latest LP.
There is some background
love-triangle information essen-
tial to understanding the pro-
gression of Noah and the Whale's
music. When Fink's ex-girlfriend
and bandmate Laura Marling
went on tour with her solo album
Alas I Cannot Swim, her backup
band was Mumford & Sons. Mar-
ling started dating Marcus Mum-
ford, leaving Fink in the dust on
his sophomore album, The First
Days of Spring, complete with 11
successful songs of elegy.
2009's Spring was a beautiful
manifestation of Fink's rock bot-
tom. Less than two years later, the
foursome diverges slightly from
the London nu-folk scene and
cleanses its palate with joy.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. - It's
pretty rare to stifle Duke coach
Mike Krzyzewski. But the
Michigan men's basketball team
almost stifled the coach and his
top-seeded team into a loss with
the help of its 1-3-1 zone on Sun-
day.
It's a defensive set that's
proved difficult for several
teams Michigan has faced this
season, and it did exactly the
same thing when Michigan
coach John Beilein employed it
in the Wolverines' third-round
game of the NCAA Tournament.
"It kind of throws them off,

especially since we haven't been
playing it that much," sopho-
more point guard Darius Morris
said Sunday. "It's just a change
of pace. You know, we slow it up
and make the guard really have
to make decisions on the fly ...
It switches up the game and
changes up the pace."
That change of pace forces
guards to spread out more,
which in turn affects the way
even talented guards make
simple moves. Krzyzewski
explained Saturday that any
zone slows the pace of the game
and forces teams to take outside
shots.
But his fear with the 1-3-1
zone was that his players would

stand up too straight. And when
players stand up, passes often
are made entirely with their arm
rather than their entire body.
In effect, standing taller forces
players to make weaker passes.
"In man-to-man, if you're
pressured you get strong,"
Krzyzewski said Saturday. "In
a zone, sometimes that space -
and then people in front of you
in that space - makes you think
and stand up, and that's the very
first thing in playing against a
slouching man or against a zone
is to make sure you stay strong in
your stance with the ball."
The defensive pressure did
just that and held Duke's guard

Through dreams, drive and
perfection, Russell is a champion

PHILADELPHIA -
Kellen Russell stepped to
the mat Saturday night
with a dream.
It's a dream he's had for
730 days - something he just
couldn't
shake. DANIEL
He's WASSERMAN
dreamt
of never On Wrestling
feeling
what he felt 730 nights ago. He
dreamt of winning.
Winning every match he
wrestled. Winning a national
championship.
730 days ago - exactly two

years to the day before he
stepped to the mats in Philadel-
phia hoping to make that dream
reality - Kellen Russell lost.
In 2009, despite beingthe top-
seeded 141-pound wrestler in the
country, Russell was stunned by
Illinois' Ryan Prater - abolish-
ing his pursuit of becoming a
champion.
The next day, Russell lost
again, before finally garner-
ing seventh place at the NCAA
Championships that year.
Now a redshirt junior, Russell
hasn't lost since that day. Grant-
ed, he was forced to redshirt last
year due to injury. For 39 straight

matches, Russell has stepped
onto the mats, each time emerg-
ing victorious.
And the 39th time brought all
730 dreams into reality: Kellen
Russell had just beaten Cal Poly's
Borislav Novachkov, 3-2, to win
a title.
It didn't matter when he heard
his anklepop while he was tied,
midway through the champion-

It didn't matter that it took,

Underclassmen provide hope for
future at NCAA Championships

Renewing Fab
Five swagger
changes 'l

By MATT SPELICH
Daily Sports Writer
PHILADELPHIA - The
Michigan wrestlingteam - with
the exception of redshirt junior
Kellen Russell - came up short
of its personal expectations this
weekend at the NCAA Champi-
onships.
But all eight members of
this very young championship
team came away with much
more than they could have ever
expected - experience on the
national stage to prepare for
what looks to be a promising
2011-12 season.
Each of the players remarked
that what set this tournament
apart, aside from the high-cali-
ber talent across the board, was
the fans.
The team competed in front of
the largest crowd of the season.
The Wells Fargo Center was
packed to the brim with rabid
wrestling enthusiasts, streak-
ing the aisles with their school's
S colors all the way up to the nose-
bleed section of the massive
arena.
While maize and blue were
greatly underrepresented, it
didn't seem to bother redshirt
freshman Eric Grajales.
"It's really a unique experi-
ence to compete out here," Gra-
jales said. "I've learned that out
here I have to fight through all
adversity, and put any blame on
myself and no one else.
"Sure, I would have loved
to be on the podium, but that's
extremely rare for a freshman
to do. I'm just really excited that
I have three more years, and
hopefully I'll find myself at the
top of the podium every year."
Grajales led the charge for
the underclassmen this week-
end by making it all the way to
the quarterfinals, coming up
just one win short of the All-

Redshirt freshman Eric Grajales gained invaluable experience last weekend at the NCAA Championships.

American title.
Redshirt freshman Dan Yates
had a much tougher time with
his competition, losing both his
matches to extremely talented
opponents by two-point mar-
gins.
Instead of dwelling on the
loss, Yates is already hard at
work structuring a plan to get
him ready for next season.
"First of all, I need to focus
on getting stronger," Yates said.
"I'm planning to stay around
Ann Arbor this summer to work
with our strength coach. I'm also
going to focus on adding new
styles to my arsenal. I've stuck
to one style for my entire career,
because it always worked for me.
Out here, you need to be ready
for anything and everything.
I need to be one step ahead of

every one of these guys in order
to compete where I want to."
In wrestling, as in most
sports, experience and suc-
cess tend to go hand-in-hand.
National champion Russell, like
Grajales, had a 2-2 NCAA Cham-
pionship his freshman year.
At his final press conference
of the season, Russell echoed the
importance of experience and
familiarity.
"One of the biggest things is
being familiar with where you're
wrestling at," Russell said. "I
thought I had been to big tour-
naments before, but after step-
ping foot on the mat for the first
time my freshman year here, it
was a huge shock to the system
... I would tell (my younger team-
mates) to come and be familiar
with here and be confident in

their wrestling."
Michigan coach Joe McFar-
land was extremely proud of his
team this weekend and shares
the high hopes and expectations
for next year.
"One of the biggest things we
tried to concentrate on this sea-
son was making sure our young
guys competed how we wanted
them to compete, and I think we
saw a lot of that this weekend,"
McFarland said. "The cham-
pionship experience has been
really important for these guys.
"It's a great starting point.
Kellen didn't place his freshman
year, and look at how much he
has achieved.
"This experience was key to
that continued success. I'm real-
ly proud of how our young guys
competed overall this year."

The buildup had been
picture-perfect.
A week after the
release of ESPN's highest-rated
documentary ever, one that put
the Fab Five
on display
as poets and
revolutionar-
ies of college
basketball,
rehashing
old feuds and
sparking an RYAN
old rivalry, KARTJE
there was
Zack Novak
and Stu Douglass and there were
black shoes, black socks.
The symbol seems feeble,
maybe, to someone who hadn't
felt that buildup: The 0-6 stretch
at midseason. The meeting called
by Darius Morris. The close
defeats. Then, the win streaks,
the late-season victories, the
dominant performance in the
first round of The Big Dance.
But the Fab Five represented
something for Michigan basket-
ball that many probably wouldn't
understand. For those of us who
were too youngto remember
them ourselves, they were a myth
- a sign of when Michigan bas-
ketball was named in the same
vein as the Kansases, the Dukes,
or the Kentuckys.
No one will make the mistake
of comparing the two teams.
Obviously, Howard/Rose/King/
Webber/Jackson were in their
own class of greatness, cultural
icons if you will. Novak/Doug-
lass/Morris/Hardaway Jr./Mor-
gan seemed like the definition of
ragtag.
But as they walked out of the
tunnel on Sunday afternoon, the
slightest tinge of that Fab Five
swagger - something Michigan
has been searching for since the
Ed Martin Scandal - came onto
the floor in Charlotte.
These guys weren't ragtag at
all. These guys felt like heroes,
giant killers.
They were taking on the Yan-
kees, the Lakers of college bas-
ketball. Not many people will tell
you they root for the Duke Blue
Devils unless they have some ties
to the team or the university. And
they were going to kill the giants
with the swagger from their old
giant days.
At halftime, I reread Grant
Hill's piece in the New York
Times; awell-written letter that
took a sophisticated and well-
thought-through approach and
handled the situation with class.

It was a publicist's dream of a
letter.
Until that last line.
"I am proud of my family. Iam
proud of my Duke championships
and all my Duke teammates. And,
I am proud I never lost a game
against the Fab Five."
Sure, he didn't call the Fab
Five "Uncle Toms" or insult them
like they probably insulted him
on the court duringtheir meet-
ings in the early 1990s. But that
one line was enough to feel the
swagger boilingbackup a little
bit.
Juxtaposed with the docu-
mentary, those black shoes, black
socks were a reminder - prob-
ably an unintentional one - that
the Fab Five are more than a
myth. And thatthis loss will
be the last time for a while that
Michigan comes in as the con-
summate, overwhelming under-
dogs.
And just like the Fab Five,
their run has had its fair share of
heartache. The shoes and socks
couldn't transform this year's
team into a Fabulous copy of
their 1992-93 counterparts. It
wouldn't make Darius Morris'
final teardrop basket roll in.
Watching Chris Webber walk
off the court following his errant
timeout call, you felt the uncen-
sored heartbreak. And watching
Darius Morris collapse on the
court felt very much the same.
But there's something different
this time around.
Morris may not be quite Fabu-
lous yet. Hardaway might not be
either. And who knows if Novak,
Douglass or Morgan will ever be
there.
But they're different. They'll
presumably be back together
next year. All five of them.
And in the brief glimpse we
got at the Fab Five, we were
never able to say that for sure.
We felt the swagger, we saw the
talent, we embraced the villainy.
But it was always fleeting, and
that final timeout against North
Carolina was the end.
Morris' missed jumper is not
the end.
And maybe these guys will
never have the pedigree or the
swagger or the iconic status of
the Fab Five. Butsomething is on
the horizon, a new age of Michi-
gan basketball feels like it's about
to start.
And it's looking awful fabu-
lous.

Strong pitching leads Blue to sweep in Oestrike Classic

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Writer
YPSILANTI - The numbers
don't lie.
Before the Oestrike Clas-
sic this weekend, the Michigan
baseball team had only received
one quality start from its pitch-
ers. It's no stretch to say that a
team is going to have trouble
winning games when its starters
are getting pulled in the fourth
and fifth innings.
Fittingly, Michigan went 3-12
during those games.
But something changed this
weekend on the Eastern Michi-
gan campus at Oestrike Stadium.
All three Wolverine starters
earned quality starts, and two
of them got wins as Michigan
swept the weekend competition
with victories over Alma, Oak-

land and Eastern Michigan to
move to 6-12.
"It's huge," Michigan coach
Rich Maloney said. "We pitched
really well all weekend, which
is very encouraging. We found
ways to win which we hadn't
done all year. For the kids to
show resiliency and fight and
battle, we're proud of them."
The Wolverines had to sweat
out the first game on Friday
against Division-III Alma.
Despite a strong performance
on the mound from redshirt
sophomore Tyler Mills, Alma
overcame a three-run deficit
and forced extra innings.
But a leadoff triple by fresh-
man Michael O'Neill in the 12th
inning put the Scots on their
heels. Three batters later, junior
John Lorenz ended the game
with a run-scoring single to give

the Wolverines the 4-3 win.
Saturday's game marked
another pitching duel. Redshirt
sophomore Bobby Brosnahan
traded zeroes with Oakland's
Aaron Wick for much of the
afternoon.
The 1-1 deadlock was snapped
in the seventh inning when red-
shirt sophomore Kevin Krantz
drove home sophomore Derek
Dennis, who had reached on a
leadoff double.
Brosnahan finished the after-
noon with 7.1 innings under his
belt, picking up his first victory
of the season.
He only allowed five hits and
a run. Freshman Alex Lakatos
nailed down the game with a
five-out save.
The finale pitted Michigan
against the Eagles, who had also
won their first two games. The

winner of Sunday's game would
take home the Oestrike Classic
title.
In keeping with the theme of
the weekend, the starters kept
pace for much of the afternoon.
Michigan sophomore Kyle Clark
and Corey Chaffins of Eastern
Michigan didn't give the batters
much to hit, and both pitched at
least seven innings without sur-
rendering more than five hits.
At the end of six innings, East-
ern Michigan clung to a 2-1 lead.
But Michigan wasn't about to let
a promising weekend get away.
Lorenz led off the frame with
a single to left field and redshirt
junior Garrett Stephens fol-
lowed with a walk.
Everyone in the stadium
knew that the No. 8 hitter, red-
shirt freshman Zach Johnson,
would be bunting. And it was a

perfect one. Chaffins fielded the
bunt along the third-base line
and threw off his back foot to
second baseman Zack Leonard
covering first base. But Leonard
dropped it.
All runners were safe, and
two batters later sophomore
center fielder Pat Biondi deliv-
ered the game-changing deci-
sive blow with a three-run
double to left-center field.
"I was looking for a fastball
that was in the middle of the
plate that I could drive," Biondi
said. "He kind of left it up a little
bit and I put a good swing on it."
The Wolverines added an
insurance run in the seventh to
put Michigan ahead, 5-2.
Clark came out after 7.1
innings and sophomore Ben
Ballantine closed the door with
the Wolverines' second straight

five-out save.
He struck out four of the five
hitters he faced.
"Three quality starts, it's out-
standing," Maloney said. "That
gives the whole team a lift."
This weekend, Michigan's
starters each pitched 7.1 innings
and allowed just a combined five
earned runs.
Perhaps the Oestrike Classic
was the opportunity the team
needed to get back on track.
"We've been scuffling a little
bit lately," Clark said. "But once
we came out here, we just want-
ed to get after it and have some
fun. I think everything's start-
ing to come together.
"Hitters have been barreling
up some good pitches and pitch-
ing's definitely coming along, so
I think we're looking good right
now."


DUKE

Krzyzewski was dancing on the
bench - Michigan was essentially
playing a road game against the
Blue Devils in Charlotte.
"At one point coach called a
timeout and was trying to show us
his hops," Smith said. "Sometimes
coach just wants to show that he's
athletic too and then he was just so
excited."
Though Duke had the momen-
tum, Michigan climbed out of the
hole after having five players fin-
ish in double digits. The Wolver-
ines simply made the last mistake.
Utilizing its four-guard - and
sometimes five-guard - offense,
Michigan forced Duke to play just

got a lot of poise. It's grace under
pressure."
The phenom from High Bridge,
New Jersey - only an hour
and a half away from the Wells
Fargo Center, which hosted this
year's championships - isn't
overtly confident or cocky. Team-
mates say he keeps to himself.
McFarland said numerous times
throughout the week that he has a
quiet confidence about him.
"I don't think I really talk a
lot about how confident I am,"
Russell said. "But, you know,
throughout the day I might be
* quiet outside, but inside the

play at least two. Forward Ryan
Kelly was Krzyzewski choice for
mostofthegame. Kellyscored just
four points but also had to defend
against freshman guard Evan
Smotrycz - who tallied 11 points
in the first half.
On Morris's last shot, Kelly was
the closest defender in front of
him.
"(Morris) had been playing very
well," Kelly said. "I just tried to
make a little distraction. At that
point whatever happens - you
are prepared for anything at that
point."
Along with Kelly was anoth-
er unfamiliar face - freshman
guard Kyrie Irving. Irving had
just returned from a season-long
injury in Duke's second-round
win against Hampton - where
he played just 20 minutes. He had

only practiced with the team two
and a half times before Sunday's
game.
But Irving looked fresher than
ever against the Wolverines. After
not seeing much action in the first
half, Irving finished with 11 points
and three rebounds. More signifi-
cant than anything else was his
presence at the free throw line
- he sank 9-of-10 shots from the
charity stripe on Sunday.
Ultimately, Duke's stellar
guard play from Irving and Smith
helped Duke squeak by Michi-
gan.
"I just thought, I don't want to
take this Duke jersey off," Smith
said. "Michigan was playing us
tough soI thought I didn't want to
lose. I love playing for Duke and
I look forward to playing with my
teammates. I didn't want to lose."

ZONE DEFENSE

contingent, which normally
moves the ball with military-like
precision, to just seven assists.
In comparison, the Wolverines'
guards, who faced the Blue Dev-
ils' man-to-man defense most of
the game, dished out 12 assists.
Krzyzewski was impressed
with freshman Kyrie Irving's
penetration into Michigan's zone.
He was able to attack the defense
and kick the ball out, but Duke's
outside shooting was affected by
the zone - it only shot 5-for-20
from long range.
In addition to foring the
Blue Devils into low-percentage
shots, the Wolverines' 1-3-1 zone
defense forced the Blue Devils
int1011 turnovers.
Duke didn't have as much time
to prepare for the 1-3-1 zone as it
would have liked because of the
quick turnaround in the second
and third-rounds of the tourna-
ment. But one thing the Blue Dev-
ils did know how to do against a
zone was rebound. With a zone,
when players aren't matched up
one-on-one, sometimes people
can't find a body to box out, and
opposing players are able to crash
the boards with more ease. This
was exactly the case on Sunday,
as the Blue Devils dominated the
Wolverines on the boards, 33-22.
However, with Duke's inher-
ent size advantage, it's quite likely
Michigan would have been out-
rebounded by that kind of mar-
gin if it had played a man-to-man
defense as well.


wheels are always turning, and
I'm always thinking about what
I'm going to do when I'm out on
the mat there."
Whatever those wheels are that
drove Russell through stiff regu-
lar season competition - the Big
Ten plays home to five of the top
six wrestlers in his weight class
- and through Nationals matches
that atpoints were so close they
were hard to watch, the wheels
weren't going to be stopped.
Just after Russell rose from the
mat pumping his fists in the air,
he was relegated to limp weakly
off the stage. He limped again up
to the podium.
He continued to limp through
the gloomy shadows of the arena's
basement and then through an

elevator, where he greeted family.
Still in his uniform, his ankle was
heavily taped.
His hands, though, were
wrapped tightly around his
trophy. But even with his body
suddenly weakened, and despite
the fact his dream was now mate-
rialized and in his hands, Kel-
len Russell's wheels aren't done
churning.
"It's abig relief to come here
and win my first national title, but
again, I have another year, so I've
got to start training for next year,"
Russell said, only minutes after
winning the title.
After 730 nights, Russell's
dreams are now reality. But who
am I to think the 731st dream will
be any different?

Michigan coach John Beilein helped Michigan reach the third round of the
NCAA Tournament last weekend.

"It was very effective," junior
guard Stu Douglass said Sunday.
"When we threw it out there it
kind of made them stumble a lit-
tle bit on the offensive end. They
were getting some good looks ...
When we went into it, it was very
effective."
Michigan employed the 1-3-1
zone more in the second half and
outscored Duke by two points
in that stanza. However the
foul troubles of freshman Evan

Smotrycz and redshirt freshman
Jordan Morgan forced Beilein
to move players into different
positions in the zone, but he was
pleased with the overall perfor-
mance of his team.
"It's a unique defense that we
used when I was at Richmond
... and at West Virginia," Beilein
said. "We practice it often, we
use it rarely. But when we do
use it and it's effective, we'll stay
with it."

sistent option Michigan has.
"I think, too, on that shot, a
clean look would have been if we
let him go to the basket," Duke
coach Mike Krzyzewski said.
"He played a great game. That
kid is one of the best guards in
the country. He reminds me of
Andre Miller, you know, and
how he plays, because he can
run the point from out on top
and he can run the point from
inside."
And though one can blame
or praise Morris for attempting
that shot, the Los Angeles native
is one of the biggest reasons
that the Wolverines were in this
position.
Morris finished the game

with a team-high 16 points and
recorded six assists and three
rebounds. All season, Morris
has been the guy to step up and
make plays for Michigan when it
needed them most.
After saying at the Big Ten
media day in Chicago earlier
this season that the team would
reach the 20-win mark and
Michigan proceeded to lose six
conference games in a row at
one point. Morris looked like a
dreamer.
But then Morris - who leads
the Wolverines in scoring, aver-
aging 15 points a game - did
exactly that. The Wolverines
recorded their 20th win against
Illinois right before getting
selected to go dancing as a No.
8 seed.
The floor general is an inte-
gral component in the success of

Michigan coach John Beilein's
offensive scheme: Since Morris
can run the point from either the
top or inside the paint, Michi-
gan's 3-point shooting weapons
become much more lethal with
him on the floor. Not to mention,
he can score himself.
"His baskets were on extend-
ed dribbles," Krzyzewski said.
"And just to make sure that our
transition defense didn't give up
the layup, it wasn't the shot that
he has been hitting ... (Morris)
played a great game. That kid,
he's very, very good. I mean, he's
very good."
Morris missed the shot that
could have extended the Wol-
verines season by another game
at least, but he's also the reason
Michigan has been so competi-
tive with some of the top teams
in the nation.

Michigan's loss in the
CCHA seminfinals
doesn't mean much

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
DailySports Writer
DETROIT - As the top seed in
the CCHA Tournament, senior
forward Louie Caporusso real-
ized that the No. 5 Michigan
hockey
team had WMU 5
a target on MICHIGAN 2
its back.
"When NOTRE DAME 2
you come MICHIGAN 4
in as a one
seed, everyone wants to take
you down," Caporusso said. "We
were that team last year, coming
in as a seven seed. You've gotthat
desperation in your game."
But the Wolverines were their
own worst enemy, turning in a
Jekyl and Hyde performance
at Joe Louis Arena - getting
thrashed 5-2 by fourth-seeded
Western Michigan in the semi-
finals, and toppling No. 2 seed
Notre Dame 4-2 in the consola-
tion game.
On Friday, the Broncos easily
pierced the Michigan target.
Western Michigan forward
Mike Leone started the speedy
demolition of the Wolver-
ines with a tip-in goal midway
through the first period. The
goal came on a 5-on-3 advantage,
after a pair of penalties taken by
Michigan freshmen - forward
Derek DeBlois and defenseman
Jon Merrill.
And the steady stream to the
penalty box didn't stop there, as
Western Michigan tallied two
more power-play goals in the
second period to take a choke-
hold on the game.
After Bronco forward Matt
Tennyson picked up a rebound
to the left of Michigan senior
goaltender Shawn Hunwick and
flicked it past the goalie from
his knees to push the lead to 3-0,
Hunwick - Michigan's steadiest
performer for the last six months
- crumbled.
The goaltendernjoined a scrum
behind the net, shoving a West-
ern Michigan player before being
pulled away by the referee.
"I think he overreacted, he

got too emotionally involved in
the game," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said. "He's disappoint-
ed, he's proud, he's a warrior, and
it didn't help his game tonight."
Helped by a pair of turnovers
at the Michigan blue line - the
first from sophomore forward
Lindsay Sparks, then senior for-
ward Ben Winnett - the Broncos
slipped two more past a frustrat-
ed Hunwick.
In the second intermission,
trailing 5-1, Berenson gave the
nod to senior goaltender Bryan
Hogan to take the net.
"I've been in that same locker
room in this same building down
5-1 in the third period and won
the game," Berenson said. "So
you never know what's going
to happen. Sometimes a goalie
change will wake everybody up,
but it didn't."
Standing at the end of the
bench during the final 20 min-
utes of the loss, Hunwick was in
the opposite position that he was
a year earlier. He led the Wolver-
ines to a CCHA Tournament title
in 2010 in emergency relief of an
injured Hogan, but now he was
the story of the weekend for all
the wrong reasons.
The Wolverines poured on
13 shots in the third period, but
could only muster a single goal -
a redirection goal from Sparks.
"We were embarrassed,"
Caporusso said. "You never want
to lose like that at the Joe."
With the loss, Michigan was
slated to face No. 8-ranked Notre
Dame, who was routed by No. 6
Miami (Ohio) in its semifinal.
Both of the tournament's top
seeds were limping into their
consolation matchup.
"There's not a coach in the
league that likes the third-place
game," Notre Dame coach Jeff
Jackson said Friday. "We've tried
to vote it out a hundred times.
But the bottom line is that it'll
be an important game for us or
whoever."
But Hunwick wanted to be
there. And he showed it.
"You give up five goals, get
pulled after the second, you

should be pretty motivated to
come back the next day," Hun-
wick said. "Last night I lost my
composure a little bit, I was frus-
trated at how things were going.
I wasn't really mad at anybody
but myself, and I probably took
it out in the worst way possible.
That's the good thing about@
hockey, you've got another game
the next day."
Hunwick pitched a near-flaw-
less game against the Fighting
Irish on Saturday, carrying the
Wolverines with a career-high
42 saves in regulation.
But for the second-straight
night, Michigan fell down
early, when Hunwick's clearing
attempt hit the referee's hel-
met and dropped right to Notre
Dame forward Riley Sheahan in
the slot.
The Wolverines charged back
with a pair of goals 15 seconds
apart from Caporusso and senior
forward Carl Hagelin to take a
2-1 lead, which proved sufficient
until the final two minutes of the
game.
Five mintues into the third
period, sophomore forward Jeff
Rohrkemper snuck in a rebound
to extend the Michigan lead, but
it was Hunwick who saved the
day with a brilliantglove save less
than a minute later. The Wolver-
ines depended on that save, since
Notre Dame pulled to within one
with an extra-attacker goal with
1:22 remaining in the game.
In the end, Friday's goat was
Saturday's hero.
And as the Wolverines prepare
to face Nebraska-Omaha next
weekend in the NCAA regionals,
they will depend on Hunwick to
shine in the shadow of the Gate-
way Arch in St. Louis.
"With a solid goaltender like
Shawn Hunwick, there's no tell-
ing what we could do," Capo-
russo said at the postgame press
conference Saturday. "This game
right here, we owe it all to him.
Some of the saves he made were
unbelievable. We have a confi-
dent goaltender, and we're confi-
dent in our goalie - he's got to be
our best player."

DETROIT -
Yes, the Michigan hockey
team was beaten, man-
handled, throttled and
was on the receiving end of,
as they say
(the omni-
present but P
never defined
'they'), an
old-fashioned
butt whoop-
ing. Yes,
the fourth- MICHAEL
ranked Wol-
verines lost FLOREK
to Western
Michigan 5-2.
Yes, it cost them a No. 1 seed and
doesn't sound so good when you
tell your roommates.
It doesn't matter.
This isn't last year, when
Michigan headed into the CCHA
semifinals as a No. 7 seed and
needed to win the CCHA Tour-
nament to earn an NCAA bid.
This year, the Wolverines were
the top seed and had locked up
an NCAA Tournament bid when
they swept Northern Michigan
on the final weekend of the
regular season to win the CCHA
regular season title. Of course
they wanted to win the Tourna-
ment as well, but they didn't
need it.
"I think overall in the game
we didn't show enough despera-
tion to win the game," senior
forward Carl Hagelin said.
But what desperation was
there for the Wolverines? They
have now won two of the last
five CCHA Tournament titles
and will goto the NCAA Tour-
nament for the 21st straight year.
You just need to be in, seeding

doesn't matter that much. To
win the whole thing you'll have
to beat everybody anyway. You
can try to manufacture urgency,
but it's not the same as the real
thing.
The Broncos had despera-
tion. They needed to win the
semifinal game to earn an NCAA
Tournament bid. After finishing
last in the conference a year ago
and finishing fourth this year,
well behind the top three, West-
ern Michigan had to prove they
belonged with the bigboys. They
needed to win.
Even Miami had it. Out of all
its senior class accomplished
- back-to-back Frozen Four
appearances, being less than a
minute away from a National
Championship in 2008 - the
program's first CCHA Tourna-
ment Title was the only thing
left off their resumes. And after
getting handled by Michigan
last year, the RedHawks' biggest
rival (I know it isn't the other
way around) added a Hummer-
sized tank of gasoline to the fire.
Let's flashback to last year,
though. Michigan destroys top-
seeded Miami 5-2 in the CCHA
Tournament semifinals. The jug-
gernaut goes down, the invin-
cible becomes, well, the vincible.
And the RedHawks realize it's a
good thing.
"This will refocus us, get us
focused on the national tourna-
ment now," then-Miami forward
Tommy Wingels said.
And then they tore through
their first-round game and head-
ed into a slugfest for the regional
final. Miami won the regional in
double overtime, and its season
ended in the Frozen Four.

Sunday, after hearing their
name announced as a No. 2 seed,
the Wolverines were singing the
same tune.
"You never want to lose like
that in the CCHA playoffs, but I
think after the weekend, when
you look back at it, it was a good
thing for us," senior forward
Matt Rust said.
The team isn't too concerned
with the CCHA Tournament,
and you shouldn't be either. If
the Wolverines make it to the
Frozen Four, no one will remem-
ber the CCHA Tournament.
If Michigan gets ousted from
the NCAA Tournament in the
first round, you may want to
come back and point to the
Western Michigan game as
the beginning of the end. But
Berenson admitted that during
the CCHA semifinals, his team
"didn't play Michigan hockey."
In some of the biggest games
of their young lives, the Wolver-
ines will play "Michigan hock-
ey" in the NCAA Tournament.
It's win or go home for good this
time. And this team has seven
players fighting to keep wearing
the Michigan sweater, the most
since 2007. Michigan will have
desperation.
If the Wolverines lose, it will
because they got beat when they
were playing well. It won't be
because they didn't play Michi-
gan hockey or didn't have any
desperation.
So take almost nothing away
from that Western Michigan
game. You probably prefer it that
way, anyway.

Senior goaltender Shawn Hunwick was inconsistent this weekend at the CCHA Tournament in Detroit. Michigan
earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament and will face Nebraska-Omaha in the opening round on Friday.

As No. 2 seed in the West, 'M' draws Nebraska-Omaha in NCAA's*

By CAKSANDRA PAGNI
DailySports Writer
DETROIT - After the No. 5
Michigan hockey team's lack-
luster third-place finish in the
CCHA Tour-
nament this NOTEBOOK
past weekend,
an NCAA Tournament regional
draw in St. Louis is just the M.O.
this team needs.
"You always want to win, but
maybe we needed that loss (on
Friday)," senior forward Carl
Hagelin said. "We were on a
great winning streak there, but
it's tough to keep that going for
very long. Maybe we needed that
loss to regroup and come out fly-
ingthis weekend."
On Sunday, the Wolverines
were assigned the second seed
in the Western bracket, along
with first-seed Boston College,
third-seed Nebraska-Omaha
and fourth-seed Colorado Col-

lege. Michigan has already faced
Nebraska-Omaha and Colorado
College this season, splitting a
two-game series with the Mav-
ericks in October and defeating
the Tigers to win the Great Lakes
Invitational in December.
The Wolverines are set to take
on the Nebraska-Omaha at 5:30
p.m. ET at the Scottrade Center
this upcoming Friday.
"I have a little bit of history
(in St. Louis) as a pro, but really
college hockey isn't as prominent
in St. Louis," Michigan coach
Red Berenson said. "We've got
to go there and play well against
Nebraska. Nebraska is a tough
team, we saw that earlier in the
year. It will be good hockey.
"And if you're good enough,
you get to play the winner of the
next game. Boston College is the
number one seed in that brack-
et, someone is going to have to
knock them off. It's like Michi-
gan basketball, we're in the Duke

bracket."
D-MEN IN DETROIT: With
junior defenseman Brandon Bur-
lon out of the CCHA Tournament
games due to illness, Berenson
had to alter the look of his usual
defensive template.
Burlon missed both games at
Joe Louis Arena, staying in Ann
Arbor over the weekend. He was
even too ill to watch the NCAA
Tournament selection show with
the team at Yost Ice Arena on
Sunday morning.
The junior played in every
game this season for the Wol-
verines prior to this weekend,
scoring five goals and tallying 13
assists along the way.
To fill the gap, Berenson put
freshman Kevin Clare with
junior Greg Pateryn, while soph-
omore Lee Moffie and freshman
Mac Bennett made up the last
defensive pair.
Moffie - whose seventh goal
of the season was Michigan's

first tally on Friday against the weekend, but I like the way they

played together this season, as son said. "Mac carried the puck

much of the season as a pair. But They're doing well in their own
after ending the weekend with zone. We played three freshmen
two points, Berenson liked the 'D' (in Jon Merrill, Clare, and
look of the new combination. Bennett) all weekend, and for
the most part, we played pretty
well."
ROHRKEMPER GETS READY:
"I slike Already depleted at forward, as

Rohrkemper, who has played
in just nine games this season,
scored his second goal of the sea-
son on Saturday in the third peri-
od to put Michigan up 3-1 on the
Fighting Irish. The sophomore's
first goal of the season also came
at Joe Louis Arena, in the Wol-
verines' 4-2 win over Michigan
Tech during the Great Lakes
Invitational.
"You don't know someone's
going to score a goal (when you
put them in the lineup)," Beren-
son said. "Jeff Rohrkemper has
only played in (a few) all year
but he's played okay when he's
played. (I) thought we needed
to make a change and I needed
a left-handed shot and so on, the
way we put our lines together.
He played a big role in the game
tonight with Kevin Lynch and
Scooter Vaughan. They had a
good game. They had maybe
a lucky goal, but an important
goal."
