After 37 years of working for 

the University’s Office of Greek 
Life, Director of Greek Life Mary 
Beth Seiler confirmed her plans 
to retire this year in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily on Jan. 
19.

Seiler shared in an interview the 

challenges and successes of Greek 
life during her time as director, 
acknowledging the negative media 
attention and difficulties faced by 
the community over the past year, 
but overall praising the current 
and future state of Greek life.

For the Daily

The third annual Makeathon, 

a 36-hour design competition, 
was held this weekend at 
the North Campus Art and 
Architecture 
Building. 
The 

MPowered event aimed to allow 

students of any major at any 
point of study, ranging from 
undergraduates to Ph.D.s, to 
create innovative art designs 
and products.

The event consisted of a 

Product Design Competition, 
a Fine Arts Showcase and a 
Case Competition in which 
teams competed for awards and 
recognition.

The 
event 
began 
Friday 

evening 
in 
the 
Chrysler 

Auditorium 
with 
an 

introduction to the competition. 
After that, teams spent Friday 
night coming up with design 

ideas and strategies, and then 
used the remainder of the 
weekend to work on them. 
During the production process, 
teams only had a list of materials 
and a workspace.

In front of a crowd of media, 

coaches, donors and former 
athletes, University President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
introduced 

Warde Manuel as Michigan’s 
next Athletic Director on Friday 
in a press conference at the 
Michigan Union.

Manuel, who is currently the 

athletic director at Connecticut, 
will officially begin work at 
Michigan on March 14, taking 
over 
for 
interim 
Athletic 

Director Jim Hackett, who has 
held the position since Oct. 31, 
2014. 

Manuel 
holds 
three 

degrees from the University 
— 
a 
bachelor’s 
degree 
in 

general studies with a focus 
in 
Psychology, 
a 
master’s 

degree in social work and an 
M.B.A. from the Ross School of 
Business — and played defensive 

line on the football team for 
legendary Michigan coach Bo 
Schembechler. He also worked 
in the Athletic Department 
in various roles between 1996 
and 2005, ultimately serving 
as Associate Athletic Director 
under Bill Martin.

Given 
his 
ties 
with 
the 

University, Manuel said he made 
no effort to play coy when he was 
contacted about the job opening.

“I want to say it was maybe, 

officially, some time toward the 
beginning of December that (the 
Turnkey Search firm) reached 
out to see if I had interest in the 
position,” Manuel said at his 
press conference. “I laughed 
when 
they 
asked 
me 
that 

question, like, ‘Are you really 
asking me if I have interest in 
being the Michigan A.D.?’ And 
(the recruiter) said, ‘Yeah, really, 
I just need to hear the answer.’

“And I said, ‘Hell yeah!’ ”

candidates Turnkey considered,

During 
the 
past 
weekend, 

Michigan Daily journalists spent 
three days in Iowa covering 

candidates from both parties as 
they compete for their party’s 
nomination in the 2016 presidential 
election. 
Look 
for 
continuing 

coverage from the Daily in the 
lead-up to the Iowa caucuses, the 
first in the nation, on Monday.

DAVENPORT, Iowa — By 3:15 

p.m. on a balmy Saturday late in 
January, only a couple of campaign 
volunteers were still hanging 
around the front door of the 
Masonic Center in Clinton, Iowa 
when a big blue bus slid down the 

building’s back alley.

The supporters who had come 

here to see Bernie Sanders had 
by then gone indoors, where they 
waited eagerly in tightly packed 
rows of metal folding chairs for 
their candidate to arrive. With all 
the action now inside the center’s 
dated basement, the streets turned 
quiet. The sun hung low, and 
most of the few stores lining Fifth 
Avenue had already closed up for 
the night. Across First Street, a 
train barreled by on tracks that 

stand between Clinton and the 
Mississippi River. 

In an alley that hugged the 

back of the Masonic Center just 
off a street that was also empty, 
there was Sanders — a presidential 
candidate who the next day would 
draw 2,200 people to a rally in 
Decorah, Iowa. But now there 
were no “Feel the Bern” chants. No 
camera crews lay in wait. Sanders’ 
wife, Jane, emerged first. An 
adviser or two followed. Then, the 

Group of students, 
faculty pen letter 
after closed meeting 
on research projects

By EMILY DAVIES

Daily Staff Reporter

A group of University faculty, 

staff, 
alumni 
and 
students 

raised concerns in an open 
letter last week to University 
President Mark Schlissel over 
what they characterized as 
a lack of engagement with 
the Flint community in the 
University’s tri-campus efforts 
about the city’s ongoing water 
crisis.

“In order to serve the people 

of Flint, we must vigilantly work 
to dismantle the concentration 
of knowledge and power that 
created the Flint water crisis, 
and to ensure that the same 
denigrating 
and 
dismissive 

systems 
are 
not 
replicated 

through 
the 
University’s 

response,” the letter read.

The letter was spurred by 

an event closed to the public, 
Friday, during which about 
140 faculty members from the 
University’s Ann Arbor, Flint 
and Dearborn campuses met to 
discuss potential collaborative 
research projects surrounding 
the water crisis. The meeting 
was led by UM-Flint chancellor 
Susan Borrego and provost 
Douglas Knerr. 

The research in question 

is part of the University’s 
effort to address Flint’s lead-
contaminated water and its 
detrimental 
health 
effects, 

which stemmed from the city’s 
decision to change its water 
source from Detroit Water and 
Sewerage Department water 
to the Flint River. The river’s 
water was corrosive to lead in 
Flint’s old pipes, leading to high 
levels of lead in the public water 
for 18 months.

Students can 

now apply to use 

system for research 

projects

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

To facilitate and encourage 

undergraduate work on research 
requiring 
high-performance 

computing resources, the Uni-
versity 
Advanced 
Research 

Computing – Technical Servic-
es is launching a new program 
allowing students the use of a 
computer system called Flux.

Flux is a shared computing 

cluster operated by ARC-TS that 
is available throughout campus. 
It is a large computer with thou-
sands of individual processors 
that students can use for high-
powered computing uses.

Originally, Flux high-powered 

computing resources were only 
available for faculty members 
and graduate students work-
ing on postdoctoral research. 
However, the resource has been 
extended to include undergrad-
uates who have a research activ-
ity that could require and benefit 
from using Flux.

Eric 
Michielssen, 
associ-

ate vice president for research, 
is responsible for advanced 
research computing and coordi-
nating computational and data 
science for the entire campus. 
He said launching this program 
is an attempt to make access to 
research computing resources 
easier and less intimidating to 
undergraduate students. 

“Before, all science was done 

using theory or experimenta-
tion,” Michielssen said. “Now, 
we don’t have to develop new 
theories to understand some 
phenomena. We don’t have to 
go into the lab and do physical 
experiments, we can simulate all 
of these phenomena on a com-
puter and use a computer as our 
virtual lab bench.”

This initiative also encour-

ages undergraduates to receive 

endorsement from a faculty 
member, and though gradu-
ate students and faculty pay 
for accessing Flux with money 
that often comes from research 
grants, 
undergraduates 
can 

access Flux free of charge.

For undergraduates to apply 

to use Flux, they must fill out a 
form on the ARC-TS website to 
request its resources through 
Flux for Undergraduates and 
include an abstract of the 
research project requiring the 
resource.

Despite 
opening 
up 
the 

resource to undergraduate stu-
dents, Michielssen said because 
of the faculty and graduate 
research going on requiring 
extensive use of the machine, it 
will be available with some lim-
its.

For undergraduate students 

working with faculty mem-
bers, the faculty member will 
endorse the student and justify 
their need for access to the com-
puter resource, and the student, 
whether they are individual 
students or a part of a student 
organization, will be given an 
account. Michielssen said ARC-
TS wants students to work with 
a faculty member.

The University has only been 

using Flux for about six years, 
but nearly all 19 schools and col-
leges have found a way to use the 
resource.

“We didn’t quite know how 

this facility would be used,” 
Michielssen said. “We didn’t 
quite know how to partition off 
a section to enable undergradu-
ate access. Frankly, it has been a 
very steep learning curve, and if 
we could have done it two years 
ago, we would have.”

Michielssen said though Flux 

just opened and undergraduate 
use is lower, it could rise in the 
future.

“That would be a great prob-

lem to have and we will do our 
best to accommodate (under-
graduates),” Michielssen said. 
“We want undergrads to be fully 
aware of the potential of compu-
tational and data science both as 
a career path and as an avenue 

for further study.”

Rackham student Jonathan 

Stroud, 
organizational 
chair 

of the Michigan Data Science 
Team, said being one of the pilot 
student groups to use Flux has 
allowed the team to try many 
different things.

The MDST competes in com-

petitive data science competi-
tions against data scientists from 
around the world in online pre-
diction challenges.

“People can make predictions 

about certain data sets and you 
can go forward on how accurate 
your predictions are,” Stroud 
said. “We submit those predic-
tions to a website that has all 
those answers hidden and they 
score us on how well we did 
and rank us against other teams 
around the world.”

Stroud said the opportuni-

ties offered by this system are 
unique and advantageous for 
their team.

“As far as we know, we’re 

the only group that does any-
thing like this at any university,” 
Stroud said. “They’ve given us 
a lot more resources than we’ve 
ever really anticipated. We’re 
still figuring out how we want to 
use all of this.”

Stoud said before having 

access to Flux, it was difficult for 
members of the team to run any 
computations on their personal 
computers that required more 
than a few hours to run because 
the students would need their 
computers for other uses during 
that time.

“These are really computation 

intensive tasks that (students) 
are running,” Stroud said. “It 
really helps on Flux being able 
to have this remote system that’s 
always going to be up.”

Krishna 
Garikipati, 
asso-

ciate director for research at 
the 
Michigan 
Institute 
for 

Computational Discovery and 
Engineering, said there was pre-
viously a gap between research 
opportunities and undergradu-
ate students.

ON CAMPUS CLIMATE

Water is not the solution to the crisis in Flint 

— according to award-winning filmmaker and 
activist Michael Moore. 

Despite community efforts at the University 

and around the nation to provide clean water to 
Flint residents, Moore said sending water bottles 
will not help the city’s water crisis.

In a letter addressed to “America” on his 

website, Moore said sending clean water can-
not undo the damage already present in Flint’s 
citizens exposed to the water. He said the brain 
damage in citizens with elevated levels of lead 
in their blood will have to suffer neurological 
impediments, lower IQs and behavioral prob-
lems all throughout their lives.

“No check you write, no truckloads of Fiji 

Water or Poland Spring, will bring their inno-
cence or their health back to normal,” Moore 
said. “It’s done.”

Moore said sending water to the city is only 

a temporary solution, as Flint’s 102,000 citizens 
each require at least 200 bottles of water per 
day for cooking, bathing, washing clothes, doing 
dishes and eating.

Instead, Moore is demanding the removal and 

arrest of Governor Rick Snyder (R), who he says 
is the perpetrator of the crisis. Moore said Sny-
der caused the crisis by replacing elected officials 
in majority Black and poor cities, like Flint and 
Detroit, with state-appointed emergency man-
agers, and by cutting costs and services to make 
up for cutting taxes for the rich.

Toxically high levels of lead have been cited 

in Flint’s water after switching its water source 
from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Depart-
ment to the Flint River in a cost-cutting mea-
sure. Since the switch in April 2014, researches 
reported critically high levels of lead in the blood 
of in thousands of Flint children, which can lead 
to serious behavioral problems into adulthood.

Over the past month, students across all three 

University campuses — Ann Arbor, Flint and 
Dearborn — have responded to the crisis through 
providing aid and promoting discussion on how 
to move forward. The University’s Prevention 
Research Center and the Michigan Youth Vio-
lence Prevention Center are partnering in a cam-
paign to send water bottles to the city.

significant 
scrutiny 
on 
Greek 

life at the University. Members 
from other University Greek life 
chapters also vandalized Boyne 
Highlands, a ski resort in Harbor 
Springs, Mich.

Seiler 
said 
though 
such 

incidents of destructive behavior 
stem from individuals’ actions, 
they ultimately reflect on the 
organization as a whole.

“This 
past 
year 
has 
been 

uniquely challenging,” Seiler said. 
“It became difficult at times to 
maneuver that and figure out the 
best way to proceed.”

She said the incident was a 

wakeup call for everyone, and 
emphasized the ways Greek life 
has developed positively since the 
incident, including a 30-member 
task force which was created over 
the summer by former Greek life 
leaders to reinforce the values 
of the Greek community, such 
as brotherhood and sisterhood, 
leadership and service.

The task force began conducting 

research and benchmarking to 
evaluate possible improvements 
to the Greek life on campus. 
The group plans to share their 

recommendations at the end of this 
semester.

In an interview with the Daily 

on Friday, University President 
Mark Schlissel emphasized the 
importance of the Greek life task 
force, as well as other restorative 
efforts initiated since the Treetops 
incident last year.

“The whole community was 

sort of carrying this black eye that 
came from essentially inexcusable 
behavior driven by alcohol and 
other substances, and I think it 
was a real cold water on the face 
moment for our community,” 
Schlissel said. “It’s forced many 
people to pay attention who 
previously haven’t been paying 
close enough attention.”

In 
an 
e-mail 
interview, 

immediate 
past 
Panhellenic 

Association 
council 
president 

Maddy Walsh, a business senior, 
said she admires Seilers’ patience 
and hard work as director of 
Michigan Greek Life.

“It’s hard to imagine having the 

patience to work with 18-21 year 
olds for 37 years,” Walsh wrote, 
“but she treats every stressed out 
college student with the respect, 
care, and time that she would give 
her own family.”

Walsh 
is 
on 
the 
search 

committee to replace Seiler, so she 
declined to comment on what she 
hopes for in a new director.

Schlissel noted that though he 

has no direct involvement in the 
appointment of the new director 
of Greek life — E. Royster Harper, 
vice president of student life, is 
overseeing the search committee 
— he remains invested in the 
process.

“It is an area that I care about,” 

Schlissel said. “Hopefully we’ll get 
somebody who is excited about 
Greek life and wants to help it 
thrive by helping us and helping 
the students involved minimize 
this risk behavior.”

Walsh 
added 
that 
Seiler 

successfully engaged with such 
important issues within Greek 
Life within this past year as 
the ski trip incidents, sexual 
misconduct 
on 
campus 
and 

diversity initiatives.

“With Mary Beth by our 

side, my board was able to move 
our 
community 
beyond 
the 

incidents of ski trip, strengthen 
our partnership with SAPAC, 
improve 
our 
new 
member 

education program, and focus on 
Diversity and Inclusion within 
the four councils,” she wrote.

Through the task force, Seiler 

said as a community, Greek life 
continues to take steps toward 
improvement moving forward.

“In Greek life, we’re constantly 

looking at our issues and our 
problems and trying to figure out 
what we can do to better address 
them,” Seiler said. “We’re always 
looking at ways to make things 
better.”

Dean of Students Laura Blake 

Jones noted in an e-mail interview 
that Seiler was recognized this 
past December at the Association 
of Fraternity/Sorority Advisors 
for her role as the longest serving 
Greek Life professional in the 
country. The University has also 
started an endowed leadership 
development fund for Greek Life 
that was named in her honor.

Jones said the search process 

for a new director, which is set to 
be completed in mid-April, will 
be largely student-led.

“The consistent engagement 

of strong student self governance 
and leadership of the community 
will continue to support the new 
director” Jones wrote. “Student 
voice and engagement in the 
search process is also essential.”

Ginsberg Center 
announces effort 
to up involvement

Mary Jo Callan, director 

of the Ginsberg Center on 
campus, is spearheading an 
outreach initiative to increase 
community involvement in 
giving back to others, according 
to a press release. The center 
was founded about 20 years ago 
to facilitate student engagement 
in learning service experiences. 
Now, it promotes student 
growth through community 
service.

The initiative, created by 

Callan, includes outreach to 
campus and the community 
in an attempt to see how they 
can best serve all of the schools 
within the University and the 
people of Ann Arbor. Callan 
said she hopes the center can 
benefit all schools, colleges, 
faculty, staff and students.

Through focus groups and 

interviews, the program has 
identified common needs 
between the University and 
community. The needs include: 
preparation for students 
participating in community 
engaged learning, a way to 
connect the expertise of the 
University and the community, 
increased coordination between 
centers and infrastructure 
for maintaining relationships 
between the public and the 
University.

The center hopes to focus on 

these needs moving forward.

University study 
suggests animal 
brain size predicts 
intellectual ability

According to a new University 

study, in collaboration with 
Michigan State University, 
University of Wyoming and 
University of Minnesota, a 
mammal’s brain size predicts 
its problem-solving ability, the 
University Record reported.

During an experiment, 140 

zoo mammals were taught to 
open a box with a lever and 
animals with a larger brain 
did a better job learning and 
improving on the task.

University researcher 

Ben Dantzer, professor of 
psychology, said this research 
highlights that animals who live 
in groups are not necessarily 
better problem solvers 
than those who live alone. 
Researchers also said this study 
could help better understand 
the evolution of problem 
solving in mammals, as most 
other research has focused on 
different species, like fish and 
reptiles.

Annual Detroit 
event to benefit 
Flint community

The annual Winter Blast 

Festival at Campus Martius 
Park in downtown Detroit will 
benefit the city of Flint this year, 
according to the Detroit Free 
Press.

The event will continue to 

support its annual beneficiary: 
needy children in the metro-
Detroit area. The funds for this 
cause are gathered through 
festival admissions, which are in 
the form of a $2 donation, three 
non-perishable food items or a 
children’s book.

The event is sponsored by 

Quicken Loans and will take 
place Feb. 12 through Feb. 14, 
containing many snow-themed 
attractions.

Meridian Health plan 

will match up to $40,000 in 
donations at the time of the 
event and Talmer Bank will 
contribute $1 from each ride on 
one of the event’s attractions, 
the snow slide. Ten percent 
of each of the 75 music acts’ 
booking fees will also be 
contributed to the Flint water 
crisis.

senator. He clutched a binder 
of policy positions or notes he 
would later flip through, but 
not really read from, inside the 
Masonic Center’s basement. He 
waved. And then he disappeared 
inside.

If the most salient moments 

of a presidential campaign occur 
on brightly lit debate stages 
or at highly choreographed 
rallies studded with celebrity 
surrogates and stuffed with a 
thousand people waving logoed 
campaign signs, then it’s the 
small moments, off-the-cuff and 
raw, that in many ways color the 
lore of Iowa’s caucuses.

Jason 
Noble, 
a 
political 

reporter for the Des Moines 
Register, said in Iowa, intimate 
interactions with voters still 
matter, largely because of the 
nature of a caucus. He said that 
holds true even as super PACs fat 
with millions of dollars to spend 
on inundating the airwaves 
seem to draw the importance of 
ground-level campaigning into 
question.

“This 
is 
not 
a 
primary 

election where you just drop in 

for 15 minutes and cast a vote,” 
Noble said. “You actually have 
to show up at seven o’clock at 
night and participate in the 
process. And that requires an 
extra level of commitment, so 
that really requires that the 
campaigns engage with their 
supporters in a really personal 
and retail way.”

So, what is a caucus exactly? 

In Iowa, one of 13 states to 
utilize the formats and the first 
in the nation to select primary 
candidates, each of the state’s 
almost 2,000 precincts host a 
Democratic and a Republican 
caucus. These gatherings are 
usually held in school gyms or 
community center auditoriums, 
and often last several hours. 
Voters have to be registered 
members of the party whose 
caucus they want to attend.

For 
Republicans, 
caucus 

goers hear from a supporter 
of each presidential candidate 
before they cast their vote by 
secret ballot. Those results 
are then tabulated and inform 
the number of state delegates 
allotted to each candidate. At a 
Democratic caucus, attendees 
literally stand in a corner of the 
room marked off for those who 

support their candidate and 
supporters of each candidate 
speak on behalf of their pick, 
trying to convince voters to 
switch into their camp before 
everyone’s 
preferences 
are 

counted. 
There’s 
a 
catch, 

though. If a candidate doesn’t 
achieve a 15 percent threshold 
in the caucus — as is likely to 
happen for former Maryland 
Gov. Martin O’Malley in many 
precincts — those supporters 
have to switch to another 
candidate and jockeying for 
those voters ensues.

In Iowa, the caucus format 

dates back to the 19th century 
and was largely influenced 
by the New England town-
hall style of governance many 
settlers 
brought 
west 
with 

them. Many observers argue 
this format lends itself to the 
kind of one-on-one interactions 
that are a must for candidates 
angling to win in Iowa.

“The people who actually 

participate in the caucuses are 
actually a relatively small cross-
section of Iowans in general,” 
he said.

before,” Laorr said. “We came 
into it with nothing prepared. 
We actually came up with the 
idea in line to register and didn’t 
start anything until the morning 
of construction. That’s when we 
started doing all of our designs and 
coding. We came into the morning 
with an idea and we went for 24 
hours, with two hours of sleep, 
but for the most part, we went 
nonstop. It didn’t even start to take 
form until 10 p.m. last night. It was 
mostly all virtual until then.”

The Fine Arts Showcase was 

new to the event this year and 
emphasized artistic ability with 
the winning team creating a web-
based virtual reality experience.

The fine arts team used an Xbox 

Connect sensor, typically used for 
motion tracking, as a 3D scanner. 
From there, the team created a 
virtual world, accessible through 
any smartphone, and hooked it 
up to cardboard goggles. The 
team was quick to point out the 
collaborative, hands-on nature of 
the process.

“The most influential part of the 

36 hours has been the people who 
have come through and demoed as 
we have been working on it — this 
was other people in Makeathon, 
staff members and some friends,” 
said Art & Design sophomore Sam 
Bertin, “The energy too. Everyone 
was so just excited every step of 
the way.”

Art & Design senior Chris 

Withers, also a member of the 
team, agreed and said teamwork 
contributed to the experience.

“Everyone has had suggestions,” 

he said. “We got coding advice 
from people. It was the perfect 
place to be to get all the help we 
needed to make it happen.”

The event’s Case Competition 

was sponsored by the National 
InstrumentsCorporation. 
The 

task required teams to create a 
functioning robot prototype that 
could climb stairs.

Rohan 
Dasika, 
Engineering 

senior and one of the directors of 
the Makeathon, said the case was 
focused on structure.

“We wanted to look at making 

from a very structured, judging 
point of view, as opposed to 
open making,” Daskia said. “The 
purpose was to bring in a case and 
a have very, very specific problem 
to be solved and students would be 
judged against the rubric.”

Engineering senior Christopher 

Shih said he enjoyed his team’s 
creation process.

“The 36 hours were stressful 

but not impossible,” Shih said. 
“It was definitely hard. I’ve been 
awake for over 24 hours. But the 
experience of just getting the robot 
to work — for instance, out of the 
36 hours, ours worked on hour 35. 
That’s the positive reinforcement 
— that what we did for the last 
36 hours worked and actually 
fulfilled its purpose. Otherwise, 
you don’t waste 35 hours, and you 
do learn things. Even if you fail 
there is very much to be learned 
from experiences like this.”

The 
event 
culminated 
in 

an 
awards 
ceremony 
Sunday 

afternoon, in which cash prizes 
were given out in each category.

“The importance of the event 

is to spread the culture of making 
across campus,” Dasika said. “This 
is one of the avenues that people 
can choose to come — explore 
creativity, explore making and 
bring their ideas to life. Classes 
get very routine and monotonous 
and it’s just doing problems and 
readings. People here have learned 
a tremendous amount. I think this 
sort of experience is very valuable 
in today’s world. And especially 
with how the culture of business 
is shaping up, I think these are 
the skills that are going to carry 
people forward in the future.”

MAKEATHON

meeting was closed to both the 
media and Flint residents, the 
Equitable Research in Flint 
Organizing Committee — a 
group comprised of University 
community members — sent a 
petition to Schlissel Thursday 
expressing their frustrations 
with the meeting’s lack of 
transparency. They also noted 
their 
appreciations 
for 
the 

University’s willingness to take 
action in response to the crisis.

The University has said it 

will provide $100,000 in seed 
funding for developing research 
projects. In an interview with 
the Daily on Friday, Schlissel 
said he hopes to give faculty the 
means to establish preliminary 
data 
to 
eventually 
attract 

additional funding, and that 
the 
research 
projects 
will 

eventually allow policymakers 
and the national government to 
better help the citizens of Flint.

In the letter, the group said 

the University is not as focused 
on research-based ways to 
assist the residents of Flint as 
they are academic exploration 
through 
research. 
The 

organization said they hope any 
future research endeavors will 
be carried out in collaboration 
with representatives from Flint.

“Historically, 
relationships 

between 
researchers 
and 

marginalized 
communities 

have 
been 
fraught 
with 

extractive methodologies that 
benefit academics but leave 
communities unchanged and 
worse-off 
than 
they 
were 

before,” the letter stated.

The Equitable Research in 

Flint Organizing Committee 
relayed a list of nine demands 
in the letter, including calls for 
open and transparent dialogue 
between 
researchers, 
Flint 

residents 
and 
philanthropy-

based University organizations. 
The organization also wrote 
that 
Flint 
residents 
should 

have a say in how the funding 
is 
allocated, 
and 
that 
the 

University 
should 
provide 

services such as child care and 
transportation to ensure Flint 
residents are included in such 
discussions.

When 
asked 
about 
the 

absence of the media and of 
Flint residents from today’s 
meeting, Schlissel said in an 
interview with the Daily Friday 
the meeting was closed to the 
public because it was a chance 
for faculty of all three campuses 
to get to know each other, and 
was a preliminary meeting to 
help spur academic research.

“Well, (Flint residents and 

media) are not professors at 
Ann Arbor, Flint or Dearborn,” 
Schlissel said. “This is an 
academic meeting, it is not a 
public meeting to talk about 
people’s impressions of what it 
is going on. It’s getting a number 
of 
scholars 
with 
technical 

and 
academic 
expertise 
to 

meet one another, because not 
everyone on each of the three 
campuses knows each other, 
and then to talk about ideas 
for research projects. They 
are not talking about ideas 
for community service type 
projects. This is projects aimed 
at understanding.”

Marjory 
Raymer, 
special 

adviser 
to 
UM-Flint’s 

Chancellor Borrego for media 
relations and communication, 
said the meeting was closed to 
engage many faculty members 
who have never met before in 
deciding on research initiatives.

“This was really a meeting for 

the faculty to begin the process 
of talking to one another,” 
Raymer said. “Many of them 
had never even met before. This 
is about allowing the people 
who need to brainstorm ideas 
that opportunity to brainstorm 
ideas openly with each other. 
This is about function. This is 
about moving forward. This is 
about what do we do. This is not 
about a media event.”

Tri-campus research-based 

gatherings 
surrounding 
the 

Flint water crisis will continue, 
Raymer said, though she did not 
know whether or not it would 
be open to the public.

Raymer also noted resources 

that UM-Flint has available 
for the public, such as acourse 
about the Flint water crises 
available for both students at 
UM-Flint and to the general 
public. She also referenced 
other efforts UM-Flint has put 
forward in light of the crisis 
such as, frequent water testing 
and filtering UM-Flint has been 
practicing for months, assuring 
the campus that the water on 
UM-Flint’s campus is safe to 
drink.

“This 
is 
where 
faculty 

research is impact focused,” 
Raymer said. “We have separate 
things that are also going on in 
the community such as a Public 
Health course.”

Ann 
Arbor 
campus 

spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 

echoed Schlissel’s comment, 
desribing 
the 
event 
as 
a 

preliminary step in discussing 
potential collaborative research 
projects.

“We don’t expect any specific 

outcome, just an initial start to 
that conversation,” Fitzgerald 
said. “This was a specific call-
out to faculty to talk about 
how they might contribute as 
experts in particular areas.”

In speaking to the effort, 

Schlissel 
said 
he 
believed 

this crisis in Flint has a 
“silver lining” in serving as a 
catalyst to further tri-campus 
collaboration. 
Similarly, 

Raymer said she is grateful 
for 
the 
University’s 
recent 

involvement in Flint during the 
water crisis.

“It is really wonderful to 

see how everyone, no matter 
what campus they are on, is 
really engaged in making sure 
we do everything we can, as 
University of Michigan and as 
people, to help this community,” 
Raymer said.

of the search committee to fill his 
own seat, has made remarkable 
progress in his time, leaving the 
department in a state of stability.

Part of that stability came in the 

form of Michigan football coach 
Jim Harbaugh, whom Hackett 
hired. Harbaugh and Manuel 
were teammates for one year at 
Michigan, and Harbaugh was the 
captain of the team when Manuel 
was a freshman.

During the press conference, 

Manuel reminisced about sitting 
in the back of team meetings as a 
freshman, with Harbaugh in the 
front as a senior. He commented 
on how things had come full 
circle, with Harbaugh leading 
the football team as coach and 
Manuel heading up the athletic 
department.

Hearing 
that, 
Harbaugh 

stood up and gave Hackett a hug, 
slipping Manuel a No. 79 Michigan 
jersey with his name on it.

“I used to be able to fit in this,” 

Manuel quipped.

While he may not fit in the 

jersey, he should fit in well in his 
new position. Manuel is the most 

experienced 
athletic 
director 

Michigan has ever hired, and he 
has built up the foundations of 
relationships with some of the 
Wolverines’ 
most 
prominent 

coaches through visits during 
recent years.

Manuel has held his current 

post at UConn since 2012, and the 
Huskies have won six national 
titles with him in charge. In 2015, 
13 UConn teams turned in perfect 
single-year Academic Progress 
Rates. Prior to working with the 
Huskies, he served as Buffalo’s 
athletic director from 2005-12.

Now, he returns to Michigan 

hoping to continue his success 
both on and off the field.

“There should be excitement 

about the future and potential 
for Michigan to not only win Big 
Ten championships but national 
championships,” 
Manuel 
said. 

“We don’t back away from it. We 
never have, and we never will.” 

Manuel’s contract will pay him 

an annual base salary of $800,000 
with deferred compensation of 
$100,000 per year. He will be 
paid 
a 
one-time 
recruitment 

incentive of $250,000 as well as 
being provided two cars, moving 
expenses and standard university 
benefits.

R

ecently, I was reminded of an old 
story regarding a prince residing 
in contemporary India. Living in a 

sumptuous palace, the 
prince had everything 
his 
heart 
desired 
— 

food, beautiful women, 
entertainment and an 
endless supply of material 
goods. 
Sequestered 

in the confines of his 
home, over a few days, 
he decided to venture 
outside the palace walls. 
He 
instantly 
became 

stunned after witnessing 
three 
tragic 
realisms 

of life: We all get old, get sick and die. As 
luxurious as his life had been, he knew there 
was no escaping these facts.

Agitated by what he saw, and burdened by 

unfulfilled desires, the prince ventured into 
the world to find the meaning of life. After 
years of learning under a sage and becoming an 
ascetic, he reached enlightenment on his own 
— understanding the true nature of oneself 
and the world — by simply sitting under a 
tree. Alone, he discovered the beauty in being 
present and conscious.

If it’s still not obvious, I’m talking about 

Siddhartha, the Buddha.

By reaching nirvana, or supreme liberation, 

Siddhartha came to realize the Four Noble 
Truths, which, in essence, state that your 
unconditional desires can never truly be 
satisfied, and in order to rid yourself of these 
cravings, 
one 
must 
become 
meditative, 

mindful and balanced.

I 
recite 
this 
story 
not 
because 
I 

practice Buddhism, but rather to instill an 
understanding behind the human flaws we’re 
exposed to so often in the news. Looking back 
at 2015, corruption in the quest for power was 
rampant. Whether it was from celebrities, 
politicians or business owners, each sector 
of society was in hot water over their own 
Watergate-type scandal. This, of course, 
is nothing new. Humans inherently tend 
toward corruption. Like a 
two-sided coin, our more 
insidious 
habits 
linger 

behind those that are more 
endearing qualities. But 
the news provides us with 
a medium with which to 
interpret a basic fact of 
humanity: Everyone faces 
internal 
struggles 
that 

they must fight or confront 
to prevent their problems 
from inflicting harm onto others.

Though Siddhartha’s beliefs appear dated, 

they remain equally valuable today. As many 
know, power tends to corrupt. And absolute 
power corrupts absolutely. This phrase helps 
explain part of the human condition; once we 
have something — in the form of sex, drugs, 
money, materials, etc. — we want more of it 
in an attempt to abate our endless desires, 
drawn to pursue something that’s ultimately 
unsatisfying. We often strive for pleasure and 
satisfaction, living to scratch every itch in the 
immediacy of each moment.

It’s important to recognize this reality 

not only because there’s much to learn from 
errors in human judgment (or lack thereof), 
but more importantly so we can try to curb 
our 
own 
corrupting 
tendencies. 
These 

problems are deeply personal; they linger 
constantly within us and can’t be simply kept 
at bay by the continuous hamster wheel of 
achieving transient pleasure. 

Speaking optimistically, no one has to 

live in a state of constant yearning. Perhaps 
the most beautiful part of Siddhartha’s tale 

is that he was not special in and of himself. 
Siddhartha — or anyone else of high moral 
character — did not achieve such status upon 
exiting the womb. His life teaches us that we 
are all capable of reaching a more patient, 
enlightened state of consciousness through 
work. Character is developed over time, not 
inherited. For most people, it takes years of 
training and discipline to mold and shape our 
visceral, immediate drives.

So, how do you battle with your evil, 

corrupting self in the postmodern era?

At 22, having been stuck in the structures 

of student life, I’ll readily admit that I don’t 
know shit. However, there are many people 
who have fought internal battles with 
eventual success. 

For instance, take the life of Warrick Dunn. 

In 1993, the former NFL running back lost 
his mother after a bank robber shot her. For 
many years, Dunn struggled with pain and 
anger, until 2007 when he forgave the still-
imprisoned killer. For years, Dunn fought 
the instinctual urge to seek revenge, thereby 
retaining malice and spite. Instead, he worked 
to release the anger from his life and began a 
nonprofit, helping single mothers buy homes 
— a long-time dream of his deceased mother.

Or Linda Sarsour. As a 35-year-old 

community activist for the Arab American 
Association 
of 
New 
York, 
she 
fights 

Islamophobia and advocates reform for 
immigration policy, the voter registration 
system and the criminal justice system. 
Linda turns to reconciliation, diplomacy 
and 
community 
development 
to 
abate 

ubiquitous hate speech, particularly aimed 
at Muslim Americans. She’s involved in a 
swath of issues, concerning many sectors of 
the American public, including fundraising 
$1,000 to rebuild Black churches that have 
been burned down.

Or M.K. Asante. A 33-year-old rapper, 

author and professor at Morgan State 
University, 
Asante 
grew 
up 
in 
strife. 

According to his memoir, “Buck,” his brother 
was in and out of jail, his mother struggled 
with psychological ailments and his father 

had walked out of his 
life. Embittered, Asante 
was 
involved 
in 
the 

underground 
economy 

and had alienated some 
of the people closest to 
him. With the help of his 
mother, uncle and new 
school 
administrators, 

he confronted the issues 
in his life — external and 
internal — eventually going 

to college and becoming a positive influence 
to society.

These people are warriors who have 

fought hate, struggle and suffering. Their 
biggest source of meaning is understanding, 
reconciliation and facilitating the development 
of others. They embody an important lesson: 
When we connect with others on a human level 
and expand one another’s capabilities, our 
desires and dissatisfaction seem to dissipate.

As the philosopher Peter Singer explains, 

connecting with others and aiding them in 
their struggle is one way to release you from the 
“hedonic treadmill” stimulating a consuming, 
desiring lifestyle.

In four years at this University, for what 

little I know, it seems that these people have 
discovered something important: Finding 
happiness comes from an appreciation for 
the long-term, discovering inner peace in the 
moment and dedicating oneself to the causes 
of others.

Inner conflict, the right way

A

s a child, I felt like I knew 
many things for certain. I 
was Indian — Malayalee, 

to be exact. I was 
brought 
up 
in 

Kuwait and Dubai, 
both 
quite 
dry, 

torrid places. I had 
a best friend and was generally well 
liked. I did pretty well in school, so 
I must’ve been decently smart as 
well. I believed these bits, all taken 
together, created me for who I truly 
was. Everything was good, and I was 
just fine.

A few years into my teenage years, 

I somehow found myself with a lot 
more down time. Imposed with this 
space and time, I often spent time by 
myself in my dim, silent room and I — 
diligently, perhaps to a fault — let my 
mind wander. I thought about myself, 
my existence and the things we think 
to ourselves when we can’t sleep. 
Most nights, it felt refreshing, almost 
enlightening. However, at some point 
I had a specific recursive thought 
enter my mind. An itch far below skin 
and bone. This time, I left that room 
uncertain.

I was Indian, certainly, but I had 

not grown up in my motherland. 
All my years were split somewhat 
evenly between Kuwait and Dubai. 
Yet, citizenship was never awarded 
to immigrants, as per the law of 
those rather arid lands. I was caught 
between two homes; one I had never 
lived in and one that was never truly 
mine. My circle of friends never failed 
to change, my best friends always 
seemed to move away and my grades 
were never as high or consistent as 
they used to be. All that was me had 
changed. The ground was trembling 
and I was about to fall.

Many years were spent trying to 

find my footing. I tried looking for 
something solid, but nothing seemed 
reliably stable, everything always 
changed. The journey seemed a little 
futile and a lot more disheartening 

and tiresome and arduous. It really 
did feel pointless, but, during yet 
another night in the same room, I 
asked myself if that was really true. 
I reasoned to myself that whatever 
I was looking for was somewhat 
antithetical. When things changed, 
I felt like I lost control, but this was 
simply because I had given away this 
power. I had let the uncontrollable 
define me. Indeed, a little detachment 
was due.

With this newfound wisdom, the 

daze slightly faded. However, I still 
wanted to find out the extrinsic that 
held meaningful weight. I searched 
for things that were relatively time 
invariant, things that were true and 
would continue to be. I could only 
find one thing, and that was my 
family. People will come and go, the 
ground will quiver, but my family will 
always love me, and I can’t help but 

feel unbearably blessed.

After all this, I felt like I had to do 

something. I had to make changes 
in my life, otherwise this would 
all be for naught. So, I attempted 
and succeeded in stripping all that 
was insignificant. One of the most 
powerful decisions I made was to cut 
many people out of my life. I’ve lost 
a lot of relationships and damaged 
many more. Sometimes, I wonder 
whether this was the right thing to do 
or whether I went about it the right 
way. Most nights, I sleep thinking 
that it was right, but then again, other 

kinds of nights exist, too.

Somewhat 
serendipitously, 
I 

came across a certain piece by Peter 
Wessel 
Zappfe, 
a 
20th-century 

philosopher 
born 
in 
Tromsø, 

Norway. In his 1933 essay, “Den 
Sidste Messias” (The Last Messiah), 
Zappfe talks about the paradox of 
the human condition and the panic 
that ensues. One of his remedies for 
this panic is called anchoring. “The 
mechanism of anchoring also serves 
from 
early 
childhood; 
parents, 

home, the street become matters of 
course to the child and give it a sense 
of assurance,” he notes. According 
to Zappfe, flaws in the one’s ability 
to properly address the human 
condition resulting from discovering 
that one’s anchoring mechanism was 
false provoked a sense of despair. 
This sounded somewhat familiar.

One of Zappfe’s points I found 

particularly intriguing: “When a 
human being has eliminated those 
of his anchorings that are visible 
to himself, only the unconscious 
ones staying put, then he will call 
himself a liberated personality.” I 
can understand this as a goal, but 
as long as you have tethers on this 
earth, it seems unfathomable. This is 
interesting to ponder over; would it 
really be possible to attain this state 
in a somewhat practical fashion? 
And if so, would it be worth it? This 
leaves me uncertain and curious and 
inexplicably excited.

Frankly, there’s still a bit of me 

that is a little timid, slightly anxious 
over what will inevitably arrive. 
Worried over the uncontrollable and 
my unpreparedness. But many have 
lived with the same fear before me, 
and many more will do so much after 
I have lived — I suppose there’s some 
comfort to be had in that. Alas, the 
unscratchable itch persists, and I’ll 
just have to learn to live with it.

A

ffirmative action has played 
a key role in increasing the 
enrollment of underrepre-

sented minorities 
at universities ever 
since the 1960s. 
Without access to 
this tool, minor-
ity 
enrollment 

has 
been 
diffi-

cult to maintain. 
Look at our own 
university: 
Ever 

since 
affirmative 

action was banned 
in 
2006, 
Black 

enrollment 
has 

steadily 
dropped 

from 7.1 percent in 2005 to 4.1 per-
cent in 2015.

Supporters of this policy often 

advocate for it through one of three 
avenues. Some argue people of color 
have suffered centuries of discrimina-
tion and admittance to places of higher 
learning acts as a form of reparations. 
Others believe that normatively, a uni-
versity should reflect the demograph-
ics of the people it is meant to serve 
(e.g. the state of Michigan is 14.2 per-
cent Black and thus so should be the 
state’s flagship university). The last 
common argument is that diversity has 
intrinsic value and we should always 
strive to create more diverse spaces. 
Unfortunately, these arguments aren’t 
compelling to many groups (primarily 
whites, Asians and Indians) who feel 
as though affirmative action disadvan-
tages them. Proposal 2, the initiative 
banning affirmative action at the Uni-
versity, was passed by a huge 16-point 
margin. It’s clear that the rhetoric pro-
moting affirmative action hasn’t been 
effective.

But there’s a way of discussing 

affirmative action that is rarely 
explored that looks more specifi-
cally at its benefits. Rather than 
viewing diversity as a hazy ideal, 
we can instead look at how it bene-
fits students of all races. The most 
obvious benefit of diversity is that 
it exposes students to a variety 
of viewpoints. This creates more 
worldly, thoughtful students who 
can internalize and learn from 
these myriad perspectives.

That being said, it’s easy to con-

ceptualize how this benefits stu-
dents in humanities, but what about 
students earning STEM degrees? 
Different cultures have different 
ways of examining the same prob-
lem. As a child, my dad often told me 
the story of man’s greatest invention. 
One intrepid inventor created an 
adhesive spray that created a reus-
able sticky surface, but couldn’t find 
an application for it. This inventor 
was giving a lecture on his creation 
and one of his coworkers, Arthur 
Fry, who sang in choir, was in atten-
dance. Fry was often frustrated that 
his sheet music wouldn’t stick to his 
music stand and quickly realized 
that the spray solved the problem. 
Eventually, they combined these two 
ideas and invented sticky notes.

While there is no mention of race 

in this story, it does illustrate the 
value of cross-cultural interaction. 
Every student comes from a differ-
ent background, bringing differ-
ent experiences and insights to the 
classroom. However, to create these 
interactions in the first place, we 
need a diverse student body.

Diversity also has value beyond 

these intergroup discoveries. Work-
ing in diverse groups also makes 
you smarter. Sheen S. Levine, a pro-
fessor at the University of Texas, 
Dallas, recently discovered that 
people in racially heterogeneous 
groups are better able to predict 
bubbles in the stock market than 

teams composed of just white or 
just Black people. The reasoning 
goes that when you work in a group 
of people who don’t look like you, 
you don’t automatically trust them 
and default to their judgment. This 
creates more intellectual friction 
and helps people arrive at the cor-
rect answer.

There are plenty of people who 

find ethical arguments supporting 
affirmative action compelling — 
people who believe it morally correct 
to give minorities a leg up in col-
lege admissions due to our nation’s 
legacy of systematic discrimination. 
Unfortunately, these people are not 
a majority. Many Americans believe 
this argument is either inappropri-
ate or ineffective. Supporters of 
affirmative action can bolster their 
argument now by emphasizing the 
empirical benefits of affirmative 
action; benefits that will extend 
toward people of all races.

While civil rights groups have 

often discussed mass incarceration 
as a human rights violation, we’ve 
only begun to see bipartisan prog-
ress in reducing our prison popula-
tion after lobbyists began framing 
it in terms of monetary costs. If you 
go to the American Civil Liberties 
Union’s webpage on mass incar-
ceration, the majority of the points 
listed are about the fiscal toll rather 
than the deep racial disparities this 
policy has exacerbated. There’s an 
important lesson here: Sometimes 
to create progress, we need to tailor 
our rhetoric and focus on making 
our arguments palatable.

This isn’t to downplay the 

importance of educating Ameri-
cans about the effects of our 
country’s history of racism, but 
this cultural and moral change 
takes time, and creating legisla-
tive change can take even longer. 
By recognizing this and fighting 
pragmatically within our cur-
rent system while working hard 
to transform the moral fiber of 
our country, we can create lasting 
change in the social justice arena.

USA network 
ratings shift

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

In 2011, USA Network was 

the most watched network on 
cable in both total viewers and 
the all important 18-49 demo-
graphic. Their summer lineup, 
anchored by such hits as “Royal 
Pains” and “Burn Notice,” both 
averaged over five million view-
ers. Viewers also used “Burn” 
to launch a new show, “Suits,” 
to an average of four million 
in the summer. The network 
had a cohesive brand, all pulled 
together 
under 
the 
tagline 

“Characters Welcome” and with 
a “blue skies” sense of optimism 
and fun.

Fast-forward 
to 
2015 
and 

the picture looks very differ-
ent. “Burn Notice” has long 
since ended its run, “Pains” and 
“Suits” are a shadow of what 
they once were (only getting 1.5 
million and 2.3 million view-
ers respectively during their 
summer runs). The “Characters 
Welcome” brand and most of 
the shows that went along with 
it ended, and most of the new 
shows which the network used 
to replace them have failed. Nei-
ther “Graceland,” “Rush” and 
“Complications” made it past a 
third season before cancellation.

These signs point to a net-

work in transition. The USA 
Network “brand” is in flux, with 
the network trying to push into 
more edgy programming. As the 
track record suggested, it’s not 
completely working. However, 
there’s one series which can 
point to the network’s success: 
“Mr. Robot.” The show does not 
have good ratings, but it’s more 
of a sign of USA’s new brand 
than anything else they’ve done 
before.

Before “Mr. Robot” even pre-

miered, it was renewed for a sec-
ond season after the pilot was 
released several weeks early. 
This is not something the USA 
Network of a few years ago 
would have done. It was a bold 
statement to put that announce-
ment out there before most of 
the public had seen the show, 
and it was a sign of the net-
work’s confidence in what they 
had. They looked at the show’s 

tone, its unique cinematography 
and direction (like the visual 
flourish that happens when 
Elliot (Rami Malek, “The Mas-
ter”) was tripping on morphine) 
and its buildup of drama when 
making the renewal decision.

Yet, from a ratings perspec-

tive, “Mr. Robot” ’s were not 
good at all. The show averaged 
1.4 million viewers and a 0.5 
rating in the key 18-49 demo-
graphic. (Those numbers would 
double 
or 
sometimes 
triple 

when a week’s worth of DVR 
viewing is factored in). That’s 
about 30 percent below its lead-
in, “Suits,” and on par with 
the series “Rush,” which was 
cancelled in 2014. Where “Mr. 
Robot” has proven successful 
for the network is in critical 
buzz and awards. According to 
the Hitfix Critics Poll, which 
measures critic’s top 10 lists, the 
show placed highly on many top 
10’s. (It finished in the number 
four spot on our list.) It also won 
the Golden Globe and Critics’ 
Choice Awards for Best Drama 
(with pending nominations at 
the Writers Guild and Screen 
Actors Guild Awards.) USA is 
ideally looking to leverage all 
this attention into Emmy nomi-
nations in the summer.

By renewing the show early 

and showing confidence in what 
they had, USA is showcasing a 
major shift in strategy. They’re 
focusing on buzz and awards 
in renewal decisions, instead 
of just looking at the ratings. 
Instead of the formal populist 
approach, it’s similar to how FX 
handles its critically acclaimed 
shows. “Fargo” and “The Amer-
icans” don’t exactly pull in 
crowds like “Sons of Anarchy” 
and “American Horror Story,” 
but the network respects the 
critical buzz and awards atten-
tion they bring so they keep 
them on the air. USA has never 
really taken this approach with 
its programming before. “Mr. 
Robot” is darker and more off-
putting than any of the shows 
on USA’s air in 2011. It’s the 
most “brand-defining” series 
for them since the premiere of 
“Suits” in 2011, and will likely 
be a model for development in 
USA Network for years to come.

McKenzie to read 
fiction at Literati

By KELLY MARTINEK

Daily Arts Writer

On Tuesday, author Elizabeth 

McKenzie will read from her 
second 
novel, 
“The 
Portable 

Veblen,” 
at 

Literati as part 
of their “Fiction 
at 
Literati” 

series.

“The Portable 

Veblen” is about 
a young couple, 
Veblen and Paul, 
and their rocky 
engagement. It’s 
about love, about 
the two learning to deal with each 
other’s families and, somehow, 
about Veblen’s friendship with a 
squirrel. The New York Times calls 
it “a screwball comedy with a dash 
of mental illness; a conventional 
tale of family pathos; a sendup 

of Big Pharma; a meditation on 
consumption, marriage, the nature 
of work.”

Despite a squirrel being one 

of the characters in her novel, 
McKenzie said she has never been 
to Ann Arbor before. Her story is 
set in her home state of California.

In an interview with the 

Michigan Daily, McKenzie said 
she wanted to be a writer her 
whole life, from childhood to 
her time as an undergraduate at 
University of California — Santa 
Cruz to her graduate studies at 
Stanford.

“That’s all I ever really wanted 

to do,” she said. “I didn’t know if it 
would become a job or not.”

She said she loves to teach 

writing workshops and prove 
to people that they’re capable of 
writing fiction and that they are 
more creative than they thought 
themselves to be. She also offered 

some advice to aspiring authors.

“Be prepared to feel like a 

student all your life,” McKenzie 
said. “There’s always more you 
can know and it isn’t necessarily 
something you’re going to learn 
quickly or master quickly. I don’t 
mean that in a bad way, I mean 
that in a really positive way. It’s 
like you build your life around the 
pursuit, not necessarily around 
achieving one goal.”

In addition to reading from 

“The Portable Veblen,” McKenzie 
will spend time talking to fans at 
her event on Tuesday. She said her 
favorite part of readings is getting 
to talk to people about writing, 
literature and her books.

“People have contacted me 

from the places I’m going saying 
they’re excited about the book and 
that feels good,” she said. “It’s nice 
to go somewhere people have read 
the book and like it.”

EVENT PREVIEW

By JOE WAGNER

For the Daily

If there is one commonality 

between 
this 
year’s 
Oscar 

nominated live-action shorts, 
it’s that they are all depressing 
— but in the best of ways. In 
such a small period of time, 
the shorts are able to evoke 
real, heartfelt emotion. The 
miniature movies — powerful, 
thought provoking and often 
political — leave one wanting 
more from their storytellers. 
All 
five 
of 
the 
nominees 

hold their own while telling 
drastically different tales. The 
nominees are “Ave Maria,” 
“Shok,” “Everything Will Be 
Okay,” “Stutterer” and “Day 
One.”

The short film is a peculiar 

medium 
in 
which 
the 

storyteller must get in, do their 
thing, and get out all within 40 
minutes or less as regulated 
by the Academy of Motion 
Picture Arts and Sciences. Yet, 
beautiful stories are able to be 
told through the short film.

What makes a good short 

film, however, is not necessarily 
what makes a good movie. 
A short film must be wholly 
unique, something never been 
seen on the screen, or at the 
least a very original take on 
something that has. To be 
successful, the short film can’t 
simply be some action scene 
for twenty minutes and then 
be over. It must ask a question 
of the audience. It must make 
them empathize. It must make 
them think and respond to the 

question posed.

Ultimately, the short film 

is like a personal statement 
from the director and the 
storytelling 
team. 
They 

demonstrate their prowess and 
potential as filmmakers. A short 
should give insight into what 
kind of interesting and creative 
stories these individuals tell, 
how they tell them, perhaps 
even why they tell them and 
most importantly, what kind 
of films they are capable of 
making in the future. A short 
film is in itself a work of art but 
it is also an essential marketing 
mechanism for the filmmakers. 
Shorts that are successful in 
the award circuits often create 
opportunity for filmmakers in 
the feature length movie world. 
Those truly exceptional shorts 
keep the audience wanting 
more, wanting a feature from 
its creators.

The majority of the nominees 

this year did just that.

“Ave 
Maria” 
is 
a 
dark, 

comical encounter in which a 
family of religious Jews’ car 
breaks down and they must 
seek help and work together 
with a group of nuns who have 
taken a vow of silence. The 
short is thought provoking 
about the situation in the West 
Bank 
while 
simultaneously 

being humorous.

Perhaps the most depressing 

of all the short films is “Shok.” 
It is the story of two young 
boys growing up and trying to 
survive during the Kosovo War. 
“Shok” was powerful, making 
the audience cringe, and react. 

For those unfamiliar with this 
conflict, the short makes one 
only want to learn more.

The 
German-Austrian 

co-production 
“Everything 

Will Be Okay” starts with a 
divorced husband picking up 
his daughter from her mother’s 
house and later, he tries to steal 
her away. The film depicts 
fatherly love in a unique way 
but the short was, as a whole, 
slightly boring. It drags on; but 
perhaps, the film intentionally 
does so as the father clings onto 
the last of his relationship with 
his daughter.

“Stutterer,” 
the 
shortest 

short lasting only 12 minutes, 
is a depiction of the inner 
life of someone who stutters. 
It is touching, sad and cute. 
Although the film is about a 
stutterer, the emotions evoked 
are universal.

The only American short 

nominated is “Day One” in 
which the audience sees a 
glimpse into the first day on 
the job of an interpreter for 
the United States Army. The 
short is jarring. It twists and 
turns and keeps the viewer at 
the edge of their seat waiting to 
know what happens next.

Although 
the 
Oscars 
as 

whole may lack diversity, the 
shorts do not. They tell a wide 
array of stories, quite different 
than the films nominated for 
best picture. The shorts are, 
for the most part, excellent and 
may point in the direction the 
Oscars, and film at large, will 
take in the future.

but essential viewing

I 

love the arts for a lot of 
reasons, but I mostly love 
seeing myself. For me, 

art allows innumerable points 
of 
entrance 
and 
reference, 

a 
million 

spots to get 
attached and 
relate things 
to myself or 
my life. Self-
ish 
young 

millennial 
that I am, I 
love 
appro-

priating other 
artists’ 
nar-

ratives 
into 

something that serves me.

When I watch something 

funny or weird or dramatic, 
I don’t just take it for what it 
is — I see shades of my own 
funny, weird, dramatic exis-
tence. I’ll watch an episode of 
“The Office” and think of the 
friendships (and crushes) that 
bloomed in the chilly upper-
floor newsroom I spent three 
or five nights a week in. I’ll lis-
ten to “Caravan” by Van Mor-
rison and remember silly nights 
traipsing through Ann Arbor 
like a band of hippies. I’ll listen 
to Courtney Barnett and that 
weird empty feeling that has 
been bugging me for the last 
month or two will be echoed 
through my earbuds and sound 
beautiful.

When I say that I love some 

piece of art, it’s usually because 
it speaks to me like this. I see 
myself. I know that art has its 
own merits and matters beyond 
what some narcissistic college 
student can relate back to her 
boring life. But, again, I am self-
ish. I’m writing a column with 
my name attached to the head-
line and picking and choosing 
the shit I think is important 
to talk about. And right now, 
I think we should talk about 
“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.”

“Crazy 
Ex-Girlfriend” 
is 

The CW’s latest underrated 
TV masterpiece. The show has 
received a fair amount of criti-
cal acclaim, with leading lady 
Rachel Bloom receiving a Gold-
en Globe and several laudatory 
reviews from The Michigan 
Daily. But the show doesn’t 
have the numbers it deserves. 
It’s on the brink of possible can-
cellation, and only a few of my 
friends watch it.

I loathe reading columns that 

are just extended advertise-
ments for an underappreciated 
gem. Read/love/listen to/watch 
this thing! Accept my sublime 
taste in the television arts! But 
I’ll forgo my moral oppositions, 
because I am selfish and des-
perately want you to watch this 
show. Yes, you. I am speaking 

to you just like “Crazy Ex-Girl-
friend” speaks to me. Trust me, 
you’ll love this show.

“Crazy 
Ex-Girlfriend” 
is 

brilliant. Rachel Bloom is a 
true star — like Tina Fey’s wit 
and Chloe Gilke’s musical con-
fidence merged into an extra-
terrestrial 
purveyor 
of joy. 

She manages to make Rebecca 
Bunch — a character who would 
be ridiculously unlikable on 
paper into someone you love 
and empathize viscerally with. 
Rebecca is a little crazy. She 
moves from New York City to 
West Covina, Calif. in pursuit 
of a guy she dated as a teenager. 
But, as the show’s theme song 
says, “the situation is a lot more 
nuanced than that.” She’s mov-
ing because the tumult of New 
York is exhausting. She’s tired 
of chasing greatness and climb-
ing the corporate law ladder 
and ignoring the emptiness of it 
all. She wants to be happy and 
live close to the beach, and she 
could use a fresh start.

Reader, it’s hard not to see 

yourself in that. Whether or not 
your own psychological situa-
tion is as similar to Rebecca’s as 
mine is — frankly, we’re both a 
little unhinged and tend to pin 
our dreams and aspirations on 
a place or a person and hope 
they’ll be enough to make us 
happy again — there are a mil-
lion points of entry here. She’s 
funny and joyful, like I’m sure 
you are. She’s sometimes clue-
less but also very smart and 
ambitious. 
She 
(and 
nearly 

every character on the show) 
loves to sing, and the show 
takes musical cues from the 
likes of Nicki Minaj, Katy Perry, 
Beyoncé and Billy Joel. Surely 
some of that appeals to you?

“Crazy 
Ex-Girlfriend” 
is 

preoccupied 
with 
relatable 

struggles like making friends. 
It’s crazy hard to make friends, 
right? Rebecca is lonely and 
wishing she had a crew of peo-
ple who love her, as I’m sure has 
preoccupied you at one point. I 
watch episodes like last week’s 
“I’m Going to the Beach with 
Josh and His Friends!” and feel 
both incredibly grateful for my 
own crew of friends and the 
selfish desire to demand more 
from them and wish that they 
could be like characters in a 
TV show and always hanging 
around waiting for their lead-
ing lady to give them a story-
line. Rebecca desperately wants 
to be liked and to be loved. Like 
her show! Love her show!

If you care about romance, 

“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” has some 
great fodder for your desperate 
imagination. Rebecca’s object 
of desire, the dopey-charming 
Josh Chan, is sweet and sup-

portive, and his and Rebecca’s 
scenes are especially tender. 
Where she’s a ball of nerves, 
Josh is happy as the Califor-
nia sunshine, and the sparks 
of their scenes together keep 
Rebecca going through the 
tougher parts of her life. When 
I watch the show, I remember 
all the rays of sunshine that 
I’ve loved, who gained even 
more light by my own desperate 
pursuit of their glow. There’s 
also Greg, the snarky third leg 
of the love triangle, who has 
an obvious crush on Rebecca, 
though she can’t see past her 
ideal love for Josh. Maybe my 
brain is fried from too much TV 
— but reader, I’m almost certain 
you’ve been in a situation like 
this. Either you’ve loved some-
one who can’t see you beyond a 
settling second pick or you’ve 
broken a few hearts. I can tell.

You may be uncertain about 

my recommendation, since I 
love and frequently write about 
depressing shows (“The Left-
overs”) or procedural dramas 
about stoic lawyers who secret-
ly love each other (“The Good 
Wife”). Rebecca Bunch may be 
a lawyer with depression, but 
I swear this show has appeal 
beyond my own selfish appreci-
ation of seeing things I love and 
relate to. Rebecca is a dynamic 
female character unmatched 
by most of her network peers. 
Making comparisons to other 
TV shows is dumb, but I’d 
compare her to Amy Jellicoe 
on “Enlightened” or Valerie 
Cherish of “The Comeback” — 
she’s a little broken, but driven 
and sparkling and completely 
whole. The show’s balance of 
humor and primo plot develop-
ment is like something you’d 
watch on HBO, maybe “Girls” 
or “Silicon Valley.” The musical 
numbers are like the funniest 
“SNL” digital shorts put to life.

As 
“Crazy 
Ex-Girlfriend” 

enters the critical time when 
network execs decide if it’s 
worth 
keeping 
around 
or 

should go in the trash bin of 
shows that will inevitably be 
revived in 15 years, this is your 
call to watch the show. Watch 
“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” for the 
music and silliness. Watch it 
because you’ve been depressed 
and want to watch other peo-
ple making a go at happiness. 
Watch it because you’re look-
ing for someone like you, even 
if she doesn’t look like or act 
exactly like you do. Watch it 
because I’ve given my passion-
ate, selfish recommendation.

Why can’t I be a 
Balmain ballerina?

KIM KARDASHIAN

She’s so cute I want to pick her out of the ground like a root vegetable.

By HANNAH SPARKS

For the Daily

Why is it that celebrity children 

are so enticing? Maybe it’s because 
they have access to things the 
average person, can only dream 
of, but will likely never have, i.e. 
unlimited amounts of travel and 
designer everything. For me, 
the endless amount of designer 
clothes, shoes, handbags, acces-
sories, coupled with the ability to 
easily get involved in the fashion 
industry, is what I envy the most.

Suri Cruise is the first styl-

ish celebrity offspring I had ever 
learned about — really the first 
child tabloid sensation of our 
time. She already has a heel col-
lection that will forever exceed 
mine. Oh and side note, that col-
lection reportedly includes some 
custom red bottom shoes (AKA 
Louboutins.) That’s right peo-
ple, a nine-year-old already has 
Louboutins — let that sink in.

Brad and Angelina Jolie-Pitt 

have six children, three of which 
are adopted. These children have 
attended movie premieres, red 
carpet events and have been fea-
tured in movies as well as fashion 
magazines alongside their par-
ents. There have been rumors that 
“Brangelina” are looking to adopt 
again, and to be honest, I find 
myself wondering — why not me?

Jealous is the way I feel when I 

see yet another Instagram post of 
North West wearing custom Bal-
main. Exactly 13 weeks ago, Kim 
Kardashian West posted a picture 
of her beloved Nori in an adorable 
Balmain outfit, with the caption 
“My little Balmain Ballerina.” 
Why, why can’t I be a Balmain 
Ballerina? Besides the fact that 
I can’t dance or afford Balmain, 
why can’t that be me? I think I 
was born into the wrong family. 
Look, I love my family and they’re 
great; but are they Gucci great? 

Oh, the Wests…

There are open doors around 

every corner for these accidental 
starlets. Exhibit A: Romeo Beck-
ham. Romeo is one of David and 
Victoria Beckham’s four chil-
dren. He was a trailblazer for the 
Beckham children and celebrity 
children alike when he debuted 
his first Burberry ad campaign 
for Spring/Summer 2013. He then 
starred in two more Burberry 
campaigns, both notably being 
the Christmas campaigns for 2014 
and 2015. I have a soft spot for 
Romeo, and although I am seven 
years his senior … I will wait for 
him.

Lily-Rose Depp, the daugh-

ter of the talented and attractive 
actor Johnny Depp, has recently 
been working closely with Karl 
Lagerfeld. While last year she 
only found herself as the star of 
Chanel’s 2015 eyewear campaign, 
I can predict with 99 percent 
accuracy that us peasants will see 
her popping up in more of these 
high-profile campaigns.

Most recently, Jaden Smith, 

who The New York Times deemed 
“The New Man in a Skirt,” played 
a major part in the ad campaign 
for Louis Vuitton Spring/Sum-
mer 2016. Jaden (the son of 
Will and Jada Pinkett Smith for 
those who may not be aware of 
the power family) is someone I 
find to be extremely innovative. 
While he stars in the campaign 
(mega cool to begin with) he’s also 
causing a shift in the way we see 
gender. I forgot to mention that 
Jaden is not a part of the men’s 
campaign. Jaden is in the Louis 
Vuitton 
Spring/Summer 
2016 

women’s campaign, and yes he 
wears a skirt. Of course men have 
been involved in women’s wear 
campaigns before, but not one of 
them has ever been dressed from 
head to toe in women’s clothing. 
My thoughts on this are as fol-

lows: hell yes, Jaden Smith! He 
sports the skirt much better than 
the other three female models 
standing beside him, so honestly, 
what if he wants to wear women’s 
clothes? He clearly does it better 
than most of us. If you’re able to 
look past traditional gender roles 
(which is what this campaign pro-
motes) then you’ll see that a boy 
in a skirt is nothing to fret over. 
Jaden is using his fame for fash-
ion in addition to representing the 
change this generation is eager to 
demonstrate and hastily needs.

Taking all of what I’ve said into 

consideration, I have to remind 
myself that these celebrities live 
their lives under a magnifying 
glass. They have no room for error, 
unless they want it to be broad-
casted all around the world. All of 
their insecurities and flaws are on 
display and constantly under fire. 
To me however, the pros seem to 
outweigh the cons in this situa-
tion. Fine, let the people see the 
awful paparazzi shots of the huge 
pimple in between my eyes (which 
is basically like a small planet.) As 
long as I’m holding that Prada bag, 
seeing my newfound high fashion 
career on the horizons, I couldn’t 
care less.

The good, the bad, the ugly, the 

expensive and the designer are all 
elements in these children’s lives. 
Although I may never forgive 
them for having famous parents, 
which allows them to navigate life 
a little more easily, I will always 
love them. I will continue to stalk 
all blogs, Instagrams and Twit-
ter accounts having to do with 
these young and stylish stars. 
Tagging my friends in the pic-
tures of famous kids with their 
amazing clothes (that I am jeal-
ous of) is something I promise to 
do. I swear my allegiance to wish 
and work hard to one day (hope-
fully) get on their level of designer 
delights.

FILM REVIEW

STYLE NOTEBOOK

‘Hitchcock/Truffaut’ 
 

cinema geek’s dream

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

In 1962, renowned French 

filmmaker and icon of the 
French New Wave, François 
Truffaut, 
sat 
down 
for 
an 

interview with the massively 
popular 
American 
director 

Alfred Hitchcock. At the time, 
although most of Hitchcock’s 
films were blockbuster hits, 
they were generally regarded 
by critics as gimmicky and 

thin, their innovative suspense 
techniques superficial rather 
than masterful. When asked 
who 
his 
favorite 
filmmaker 

was, Truffaut responded Alfred 
Hitchcock, shocking his fans 
and shedding a new light on 

the masterful composition of 
Hitchcock’s dramatic thrillers. 
The subsequent conversation 
between 
the 
two 
directors 

is recorded as one of the 
most influential dialogues in 
filmmaking history, inspiring 
another 
wave 
of 
directors 

across the world.

First published as a book, 

the documentary “Hitchcock/
Truffaut” 
delves 
into 
this 

conversation through the eyes 
of some of the most popular 
directors of today. Big names 
like 
Wes 
Anderson 
(“The 

Grand 
Budapest 
Hotel”), 

David Fincher (“Gone Girl”), 
Akira 
Kurosawa 
(“Seven 

Samurai”) and Martin Scorsese 
(“Goodfellas”) claim that it was 
this book that allowed them to 
access filmmaking in a way that 
pushed 
past 
entertainment, 

and revealed the construction 
behind 
the 
magic 
they 

witnessed 
on 
screen. 
For 

these directors, the published 
transcript of this conversation 
became a cinematic bible, with 
shot by shot breakdowns of 
Hitchcock’s most compelling 
scenes 
and 
straightforward 

dialogue regarding the most 
powerful ways to engage an 
audience through film. While 
any conversation with Hitchock 
or Truffaut would be valuable, 
it’s the candid rapport between 
the 
two 
that 
makes 
their 

conversation so influential. As 
the two try to learn from each 
other, those listening are given 
a direct line to learn from them 
as well.

It seems almost obvious to 

say that film is a visual medium, 
and the careful construction 
of the image is what pulls an 
audience in. Looking at this 
construction, the documentary 
works to dismantle the notion 
that to be regarded highly, 
cinema 
must 
be 
“serious,” 

and must have a fully logical 
framework. In many ways, this 
is exactly what Hitchcock’s 
films are not — the logic is shaky 
and the actions overdramatized 
to 
the 
point 
of 
disbelief. 

However, as Scorsese notes at 
one point in the documentary, 
instead of appealing to realism, 
Hitchcock 
appealed 
to 
the 

“spirit of realism,” an even 
more powerful device that kept 
audiences across the country at 
the edge of their seats.

While 
the 
documentary 

focuses on the work of Truffaut 
and Hitchcock through the 
eyes of today’s most famous 
directors, it also inadvertently 
gives us a window into the 
minds 
of 
these 
directors 

at 
work. 
When 
analyzing 

Hitchcock’s pervasive religious 
themes, Fincher notes that 
in watching films, it can be 
almost unsettling how much 

we learn about the filmmaker, 
their fears, their obsessions 
and 
their 
deepest 
desires. 

This is a sentiment echoed by 
all commentators in the film, 
and reveals a facet of their 
work that may have otherwise 
been overlooked. Hitchcock’s 
films communicate his darkest 
obsessions 
in 
a 
way 
that 

makes them acceptable for an 
audience, and in doing this, he 
gave permission to the next 
generation of filmmakers to do 
the same.

While 
somewhat 
slow 

at 
times, 
“Hitchcock/ 

Truffaut” works as a largely 
informational documentary. To 
those interested in filmmaking, 
the 
in-depth 
discussion 
of 

cinematic 
technique, 
the 

construction of the image and 
the revelatory aspects of passion 
project movies is engrossing. 
But, 
the 
documentary’s 

continual references to the 
large archive of Hitchcock and 
Truffaut’s works could serve 
to alienate those less involved, 
although the pull of celebrity 
gives a splash of excitement to 
the otherwise informational 
film. In the same way as the 
original book, the documentary 
stands not as art within itself, 
but as inspiration for those just 
as fascinated by the image as 
these famous filmmakers.

EW YORK — Frank 
Sinatra said if you can 
make it in New York, 

you could 
make it 
anywhere. 
In 2013, 
the Big Ten 
took note 
and decided 
it wanted 
to be a part 
of it: New 
York, New 
York.

So 

the conference, once called 
the Western Conference, 
started spreading the news 
— it was headed east. The 
Big Ten penned an eight-
year partnership with the 
Pinstripe Bowl to have one of 
its schools play in the annual 
post-season game at Yankee 
Stadium. Next, it added 
two East Coast schools in 
Rutgers and Maryland. Then, 
it announced plans to host 
the men’s basketball Big Ten 
Tournament in the Verizon 
Center in Washington D.C. 
and Madison Square Garden 
in New York in 2017 and 2018, 
respectively.

The deal with Madison 

Square Garden also included 
the arena being the home 
of the inaugural “Super 
Saturday,” a basketball-hockey 
double header between 
Michigan and Penn State, the 
first true test to see if the Big 

Ten could make it there.

An hour after the Michigan 

men’s basketball team edged 
Penn State on Saturday at 
Madison Square Garden, it 
looked like Sinatra was right — 
the Big Apple would be fruitful 
for the Big Ten. American 
Whiskey — a restaurant and 
bar just three blocks from the 
arena — played host to hoards 
of Wolverines fans celebrating 
the victory.

And why not celebrate?
Michigan, their Michigan, 

played just around the 
corner in The World’s Most 
Famous Arena, and thanks 
to a 20-point performance 
from Zak Irvin and a double-
double from Derrick Walton 
Jr., they were winners for the 
afternoon. So they turned 
the Midtown bar into a sea 
of maize and blue — a scene 
you’d expect at Skeeps, but not 
at a bar just a few blocks from 
Times Square.

The schools took to the 

hardwood first, before the the 
floor came up and the ice came 
out.

Michigan started the day 

with a 7-0 run on the court 
and never gave the lead back, 
downing Penn State, 79-72. 
Then, at night, the Michigan 
hockey team used four third-
period goals to roll past the 
Nittany Lions, 6-3.

One venue. Two Michigan 

wins.

Cornhuskers top 
‘M’ in upset win

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

In 
gymnastics, 
a 
poor 

showing in only one event can 
dramatically alter the final result 
of the meet. No matter how well 
a team performs in the rest of 
the contest, it must maintain its 
consistency throughout to get 
the victory.

After stellar performances 

in vault, uneven bars and floor, 
the No. 3 Michigan women’s 
gymnastics 
team 
failed 
to 

maintain its lead in the beam 
event, losing to No. 17 Nebraska 
(3-0-0 Big Ten, 5-0-0 overall), 
196.775-196.550.

“Part of what we have to do is 

learn how to finish meets,” said 
Wolverines assistant coach Dave 
Kuzara. “(Whether) we finish on 
beam or finish on another event, 
we didn’t finish as strong as we 
normally had.”

Friday night was just the 

second time this season that 
Michigan 
(2-0-1, 
5-0-1) 
has 

finished on beam. While at 
home, the Wolverines end with 
floor, with its glamorous dance 
and acrobatic moves to make the 
end of the meet seem like a grand 
finale. At Nebraska, Michigan 
was not afforded that luxury. 

While the Wolverines lost the 

meet, many individuals achieved 
top scores and attained career 
highs.

Continuing on her impressive 

season, freshman Olivia Karas 
won the all-around title in 
Friday’s meet and tied for first 
in vault. She also tied her career 
high in floor with a score of 
9.950.

Other bright spots for the 

Wolverines 
included 
senior 

Austin Sheppard, who set her 
season high in uneven bars. 
Freshman 
Emma 
McLean 

attained a 9.875 on floor, the best 
of her young career, while junior 
Nicole Artz led the entire meet 
with a 9.975 in floor to set her 
career high.

When asked which players 

stood out in Friday’s meet, 
Kuzara mentioned Karas’s great 
season and also offered praise to 
other young athletes.

“It would be silly not to 

mention Olivia,” Kuzara said. 
“Week in and week out, (she 
is) really doing a great job. 
(Sophomore) 
Brianna 
Brown 

competed in the all-around in 
full, and with all of her skills, 
(she) did a great job. Emma 
McLean put together two good 
events competing in the lineup 
spots.”

The loss marked the first time 

this season Michigan has scored 
under a 49 in an event, a core 
factor behind the Wolverines’ 
first loss this season. Its season 
average in beam prior to the 
meet was a solid 49.225.

Kuzara explained that some 

mishaps on the beam caused the 
team to receive a lower score.

“We had a few bobbles,” 

Kuzara said. “Obviously, we 
want to perform to the best of our 
ability, and we fell short of that, 
but it’s time to start thinking 
about the next competition.”

Though Michigan suffered 

its first defeat of the season, it 
will take many lessons from this 
meet and use them in practices to 
prepare for its next competition 
in two weeks.

“Every meet, you get a little bit 

more feedback from the judges,” 
Kuzara said. “Sometimes you 
really take that information and 
really work on the finer points 
with what we’re doing.”

As the first half of the season 

draws to a close, Michigan no 
longer sits at the top of the Big 
Ten standings. In addition, its 
ranking will drop because of its 
performance Friday night.

Yet, 
Kuzara 
remains 

optimistic and believes the loss 
will motivate the team.

“When you have a little bit 

of a hiccup, it tends to refocus 
everybody,” Kuzara said. “This 
is a great team, a great group 
of women. We’ll get back in the 
gym, and we’ll work real hard.” 

WOMEN’S GYMNASTICS
Michigan seeks stability in Manuel

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

During 
and 
after 
Warde 

Manuel’s 
introduction 
as 

Michigan’s next athletic director 
Friday, there was talk from 
several people about the state of 
college athletics today.

The business has never been 

bigger, more publicized or more 
prominent. No one delved into 
specifics, but almost every aspect 
of the enterprise is becoming 
more popular. The University’s 
Athletic 
Department 
operates 

with a $151 million budget. Former 
football coach Lloyd Carr noted 
how different merely recruiting is 
than when he coached from 1995 
to 2007.

“This is not a job that is 

honorific or that’s a hobby. This is 
a job that is enormously complex,” 
said University Regent Mark 
Bernstein (D–Ann Arbor). “The 
stakes are very high, not just 
financially — it’s really not even a 
rounding error at the University — 
but for the safety of our students. 
This is a tumultuous moment in 
college athletics, and I think it’s 
only going to get bumpier. To have 
someone who has been engaged 
and involved in that his whole 
career … that’s who you want.

“This is not a job or a moment to 

engage in an experiment.”

In Manuel, who will begin work 

March 14, the University hired 
a sitting athletic director for the 
first time in its 
history. Those 
who provided 
input 
into 

the 
search 

hope 
that 

experience 
will 
help 

Manuel 
navigate 
the 

challenges of 
the job.

“I think it’s 

important that our leadership, 
both our athletic director and our 
administration, appreciate how 
complicated that is,” Bernstein 
said. “I think Warde gets that. I 
think that he, in many ways, has 
demonstrated an appreciation 
for the importance of the well-
being of student-athletes, the 
place that athletics plays as it 

relates to the University and the 
culture of the University.”

The last search for a full-time 

athletic director — excluding 
Schlissel’s appointment of Jim 
Hackett in the interim starting 
Oct. 31, 2014 — gave the University 
Dave Brandon, who came, like 
multiple other athletic directors, 
from a business background. 

Manuel 
has 

been a college 
athletics 
administrator 
for almost his 
entire career.

Just 
as 

appealing 
are 

his ties to the 
University as a 
former football 
player, alumnus 
and 
associate 

athletic director.

“It’s very difficult for anyone 

who has not been at this university, 
or a similarly situated university, 
to understand the very unique 
role that athletics plays at this 
university,” Bernstein said. “Not 
just the importance of athletics 
on its own, but the relationship 
of athletics to a university that 

aspires 
to 
greatness 
in 
the 

academic sphere also.”

At 
one 
time, 
University 

President Mark Schlissel appeared 
to be one of those people. Before 
coming to Michigan, he was the 
provost at Brown. In July 2014, six 
months into his tenure, Schlissel 
noted at a Board of Regents 
meeting that athletics were not 
part of the mission statement of 
the University.

But in two years as president, 

Schlissel 
has 
made 
several 

important decisions regarding 
in 
athletics, 
most 
notably 

appointing Hackett as interim 
athletic director, which had 
positive results.

“What I’ve come to learn, 

actually, as I try to grow into 
being a ‘Michigan Man,’ is the 
cultural role athletics plays in 
our community,” Schlissel said. 
“It’s not the core mission of the 
university — I don’t think anyone 
makes that mistake — but it’s a 
deep part of our culture. It’s the 
window through which many 
people see and remain attached 
to the University through the 
years, through the decades, all 
around the country, all around 

the world.”

From 
1921 
to 
1988, 
the 

University had just three athletic 
directors. Since 1988, a span just 
over half as long, Manuel is the 
eighth 
athletic 
director. 
The 

University sought a candidate 
who could add stability, and 
Manuel, 47, has the ability and 
desire to do so.

“This was really the first real 

search for an athletic director 
that this university has engaged 
in in two decades,” Bernstein said.

Schlissel hosted an event at 

his house Thursday night to 
celebrate Manuel’s arrival along 
with people from every part of 
Manuel’s life: neighbors, friends 
and teachers from his past.

After 
slowly 
stabilizing 

over the past 15 months, the 
University hopes Manuel can 
continue that effort.

“Certainly Jim Hackett was an 

exceptional leader at an important 
moment,” Bernstein said, “and 
Warde is the same.”

Warde Manuel is Michigan’s first-ever athletic director with prior experience as an athletic director.

“This is not a 

job or a moment 

to engage in 
experiment.”

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
Avoiding the pressure under the banners
A 

month before the 
Michigan women’s 
gymnastics team rose to 

No. 1 in the 
national poll 
on Jan. 11, the 
Wolverines 
couldn’t 
even field a 
full team for 
their own 
exhibition 
meet.

The week 

of the meet, 
one gymnast 
split her toe open on a fall and 
needed six stitches. Another 
missed on a bar mount and 
sprained ligaments in her neck. 
Another was ill most of last fall.

“We just seemed to have had 

whatever was going around,” 
said coach Bev Plocki on 
Wednesday.

The morning of the meet, 

another gymnast got sick and 
yet another had a personal 
emergency.

“It was almost like, ‘Don’t 

anybody else come talk to me!’ ” 
Plocki said with an exasperated 
smile. “But look where we are 
now.”

Where they are now is 

fully healthy and ranked in 
the top five in the country 
with a legitimate shot to win 
the national championship in 
April. Michigan struggled at 
the exhibition meet, losing to 
Eastern Michigan. Four weeks 
later, the Wolverines were in 
Cancun, Mexico, scoring a 
season-high 196.975, winning 
the meet and garnering the No. 1 
national ranking the next week.

“We did not at all like the 

way that we performed or the 
impression that we potentially 
gave people at how we looked in 
that (exhibition),” Plocki said. “I 
think there was a little bit of a 
pride factor that, gosh, we gotta 
come back from Christmas and 
pull this together and go out and 

prove to some people what we’re 
capable of doing.”

* * *

Gymnastics doesn’t have 

stopwatches or yard markers or 
goals. It has a human judge who 
sits in a chair and gives points to 
routines, almost entirely based 
on the success of the routine 
but, invariably, also based on 
perception.

“Let’s face it — our sport is 

judged subjectively,” Plocki said. 
“A human being sits in a chair, 
and they have a perception 
about whether you’re going to be 
good or whether you’re going to 
be average.”

So the path to a championship 

at the end of the season requires 
not just practicing and refining 
all of a team’s routines but 
also proving to the rest of the 
country that team can execute 
them.

By the spring, the judges 

know who the top teams are and 
who they expect to be at the top 
of the scoreboards.

“We want to expect ourselves 

to be there,” Plocki said. “But 
we need them to expect us to be 
there too.”

That 

process starts 
from the 
beginning 
of the 
season. The 
Wolverines 
have now 
competed in 
five meets at 
five different 
sites in front 
of five different sets of judges, 
scoring at least 196 every time. 
Each week, they prove to more 
people that they can be in that 
top tier.

At the exhibition against 

Eastern Michigan, they slipped 
up.

“I’m not saying that we were 

thinking about what the judges 
thought at the (exhibition), but 
big picture, yeah,” Plocki said. “I 
don’t know if they streamed that 
or not — good heavens, I hope 
they didn’t — but if that was 
people’s impression of us out of 
the gate, they would have been 
like, ‘This is going to be a rough 
year for Michigan.’ ”

They would have been wrong. 

The Wolverines have slowly 
erased that impression week by 
week with their improvement in 
training and their high scores in 
meets.

From the beginning of 

the season, Plocki has been 
open about her belief that 
Michigan can win a national 
championship. In her 27 years 
at the helm of the program, 
almost no other program has 
been that consistent. She has 
won 20 Big Ten championships, 
including 13 of 14 at one point, 
and 11 regional championships. 
In her career, the Wolverines 
have reached the Super Six 10 
times and won eight individual 
national titles.

The national championship 

is the only achievement that 
has eluded her, though not for 

lack of trying. 
Michigan 
has finished 
second twice, 
third once and 
fourth twice.

To make it 

over the top, 
the Wolverines 
must improve 
every week — 
which made 
Friday’s meet 

such a shock.

In its fifth meet of the season, 

Michigan scored its lowest total 
against its toughest Big Ten 
opponent (Nebraska), suffering 
its first loss of the season. In the 
first four, the Wolverines scored 
196.975, 196.925, 196.950 and 
196.900, putting them right in 

the thick of the upper echelon 
of teams.

This weekend’s meet put them 

just outside that group. That’s 
how small the margin for error 
is, and that’s how important it 
is for them to stay consistent 
all season. The rest of the year 
leaves little room for another 
slip-up.

“We want to prove to 

everybody in the country that 
we are consistent and we’re 
consistently good and we’re 
continuing to get better,” Plocki 
said. “I want every athlete on my 
team to absolutely believe with 
every fiber of their being that not 
only do they deserve to be at the 
Super Six, they expect themselves 
to be at the Super Six.”

* * *

Three weeks ago was 

Michigan’s first home meet of 
the season. The Wolverines won 
with a score of 196.925, but they 
made a mistake on every event, 
according to Plocki. At the end 

of the meet, they gathered and 
said to each other, “Boy, that felt 
like work.”

Since the beginning of the 

season, Michigan has believed 
it could win the national 
championship, but sometimes, 
that comes with an expectation 
of winning the national 
championship. That’s what 
Michigan tries to avoid.

“That would be pressure,” 

Plocki said. “And it’s got to be 
about having fun. I’m a firm 
believer that sports should be 
about having fun. If you are not 
enjoying what you’re doing, you 
should not be doing it.”

For the most part, the 

Wolverines have overcome their 
mistakes this season. But Plocki 
believes that if all goes well, 
they can get to the point where 
they don’t even make those 
mistakes.

“I like going to the football 

games where we score a 
touchdown every drive, and it’s 
just all cheering and fun,” Plocki 
said. “I get headaches when it’s 

the close, back-and-forth games, 
and whoever has the ball last 
is probably going to win. Those 
stress me out.”

Twenty-two Big Ten title 

banners hang from the rafters 
in the gymnastics team’s first-
class practice facility. It’d be 
easy to buckle under those 
expectations. The first thing 
freshman Olivia Karas noticed 
on her recruitment visit, 
however, was that the entire 
team was together stretching 
and talking before practice, 
having fun.

Already, the Wolverines have 

suffered multiple setbacks this 
season — injuries, illnesses and 
finally Friday’s loss. They have 
an incredibly small margin 
for error, and it’s getting even 
smaller.

Michigan won’t be consumed 

by the pressure, though. What 
fun would that be?

Michigan coach Bev Plocki’s team has its sights set on a national championship after overcoming adversity last fall.

pressure. And it’s 

got to be about

Wolverines race to blowout win

Thome posts 
career-high 
31 points to 

power Michigan

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

With one minute left in the 

third quarter of the Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team’s 

matchup 
against 
Minnesota 
on Sunday, 
Katelynn 
Flaherty 
was 
not 

playing like her usual self. 

Her teammates and coaches 

praise 
her 
shooting 
stroke, 

saying that sometimes they feel 
like every shot she puts up will 
go in. The junior guard was 
having a lackluster day, so she 
decided to pass.

Flaherty’s pass from the arc to 

the right block near the baseline 
ended up in the hands of senior 
guard Madison Ristovski for 
an improbable but momentum-
building bucket. It was a close 
call, but like the rest of the game, 
the Wolverines found a way to 
score when it mattered most.

“That was a new play we just 

put in,” Flaherty said. “It was 
funny because (Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico) was like, 
‘Throw it if it’s there.’ Then I 
waited one second and was like, 
‘Oh, I’m going to throw it.’ It was 
a great play, and I’m happy we 
executed it well.”

Flaherty and others set up 

freshman center Hallie Thome 
for a career-high 31 points. 
Michigan (4-6 Big Ten, 12-9 
overall) also made 25 free throws 
off of 26 fouls, an important 
factor in its 92-76 victory.

The teams got off to a slow 

start, as the Wolverines led, 8-7, 
by the first timeout with 4:59 left 
in the first quarter. Michigan 
has become accustomed to run-
and-gun style games when it has 
to score large amounts of points 

in transition. The Gophers (6-4, 
14-7) slowed the pace of the 
game down, and by shooting 
4-for-11 from distance in the 
opening stanza — 8-for-31 in 
total — they led 22-16 at the end 
of the quarter.

Minnesota’s next 3-pointer by 

guard Shayne Mullaney gave the 
Golden Gophers a seven-point 
lead early in the second quarter. 
A minute later, the Wolverines 
missed two 3s but regained 
possession with two offensive 
rebounds as Flaherty scored her 
first basket of the game after 
missing her first three shots.

Michigan closed the gap to 

two at the next timeout with 
4:39 left in the second quarter 
by way of feeding the ball into 
the post, especially to freshman 
center 
Hallie 
Thome. 
Two 

possessions later, junior guard 
Siera Thompson’s and-one gave 
the Wolverines a 34-31 lead. 
They rode the momentum to 
carry a 44-39 advantage into 
halftime. Thome led all scorers 
with 18 points in the half.

“Every time they went on 

a run, we had an answer,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Hallie was 
a dominating presence for us 
inside … For her to be able to 
come in as a freshman and score 
31 points and have an incredible 
day like she did today, that’s 
pretty special.”

The teams got off to a crawling 

start again at the beginning 
of the third quarter, as they 
combined for just eight points 
in the first three minutes after 
the halftime break. Michigan 
continued to dish the ball to 
Thome, as she used her height 
advantage and post moves to 
earn easy layups. The Gophers 
led for a short amount of time 
midway through the quarter, 
but with four minutes left in 
the third, a layup by freshman 
guard Boogie Brozoski gave 
the Wolverines the upper hand 
again.

Thome passed her career high 

in the third quarter, giving her 
26 points on the afternoon. Soon 
thereafter, Flaherty’s 3-pointer 

gave Michigan a nine-point 
advantage on what started as 
a relatively quiet performance 
from the Wolverines’ top scorer.

Boosted 
by 
Flaherty’s 

improved shooting and Thome’s 
prowess down low, Michigan 
took a 64-55 advantage into the 
final quarter.

Minnesota cut the lead to two 

with just over six minutes left 
in the final stanza, but Flaherty 
came alive to score two quick 
baskets. Senior forward Kelsey 
Mitchell’s layup with 4:27 left 
gave Michigan an eight-point 
lead. The Wolverines had no 
problem closing out the lead 
from there, which is something 
it has struggled with all season.

“In practice we’ve really been 

focused on finishing games,” 
Flaherty said. “We’re valuing 
the ball, loose balls and charges. 
That really helped us win today.”

Unlike 
Flaherty’s 
assist, 

Michigan didn’t just slip by 
with the win. It took command 
in a much-needed conference 
matchup in a turbulent season.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Thompson keeps 
Banham in check

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

When 
Katelynn 
Flaherty 

came into the postgame press 
conference after the Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team’s 

92-76 win over Minnesota, the 
sophomore guard wanted to know 
one of the specific stat lines.

Flaherty 
glanced 
at 
the 

score sheet and quickly looked 
astonished.

“Woah,” Flaherty said in awe. 

“She took 31 shots?”

She was referencing Michigan’s 

opponent, 
Minnesota 
guard 

Rachel Banham, who scored 29 
points on a 13-for-31 shooting 
effort.

Banham’s performance, though 

high-scoring, 
was 
innefficient. 

The Wolverines (4-6 Big Ten, 12-9 
overall) contested nearly every 
shot she took. Banham had to carry 
the load, as three of Minnesota’s 
starters failed to score.

Michigan junior guard Siera 

Thompson, who prepared for 
the matchup all week long, 
was responsible for defending 
Banham.

“We’ve watched (Banham) on 

film so much — her tendency to 
go right, her tendency to shoot 
any open jumper that she has,” 
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “(Thompson) did a great 
job trying to keep the ball on her 
left hand and trying to keep the 
ball out of her right hand, and just 
have her hands up and constantly 
be near her and not give her any 
space.”

Unlike 
Banham, 
Thompson 

wasn’t her team’s leading scorer 
on the day — that title fell on 
freshman center Hallie Thome, 
who had a career-best 31 points. 
Flaherty supported Thome with 
24 of her own, but Barnes Arico 
felt that the biggest difference 
maker was Thompson.

Facing off against Banham 

on defense, Thompson was a big 
reason that Minnesota’s best 
player missed 18 of her shots.

“Banham finished with (29 

points) and a great stat line, but 
everything she did was contested, 
and everything she did was 
challenged,” Barnes Arico said. “I 
was really proud of (Thompson’s) 
effort all day.”

Thompson finished with 14 

points and eight rebounds.

Banham has been on Michigan’s 

scouting report since earlier this 
month. 
The 
Wolverines 
beat 

Minnesota on Jan. 10, and in 
that game, Banham went for 21 
points. But just three days prior, 
she had one of the best individual 
performances in school history.

Against Illinois on Jan. 7, 

Banham set a school record with 
10 3-pointers for 39 points. She 
also had seven rebounds and eight 
assists in the 106-75 rout of the 
Illini.

“We were fortunate that we 

had an opportunity to play against 
them prior to this matchup, 
because our turnaround time 
from our last game was not that 
much,” Barnes Arico said on 
Sunday. “(Thompson) knew what 
her matchup was going to be … we 
were prepared.”

Sunday, for Banham to shoot 

just 1-for-10 from beyond the arc 
was a huge victory for Michigan. 
The one 3-pointer that she did 
convert was a wide-open shot. 
Everything 
else, 
thanks 
to 

Thompson, was contested.

Thompson’s quiet performance 

may have gone unnoticed next to 
Thome’s career day and Flaherty’s 
always-consistent 
scoring, 
but 

Banham felt the effect.

Michigan 
and 
Minnesota 

don’t have any other scheduled 
meetings this year, but the Big 
Ten Tournament begins in just 
over a month. If the Wolverines 
meet Banham again, Thompson 
will be ready.

Wolverines fall to top-ranked 
Penn State, top Northwestern

Coon the lone 
bright spot as 
Nittany Lions 

dominate

By MIKE GRIFFIN

Daily Sports Writer

As it continues to plow through 

a challenging Big Ten schedule, 
the No. 8 Michigan wrestling 
team 
faced 
two 
difficult 

opponents over the weekend, 
taking on Northwestern at home 
on Friday and Penn State in 
Happy Valley on Sunday.

Sunday, 
the 
Wolverines 

made the trip to Pennsylvania 
to face the top-ranked Nittany 
Lions. 
Both 
squads 
arrived 

with undefeated records in the 
Big Ten and possess multiple 
wrestlers capable of competing — 
and succeeding — at the National 
Championships 
in 
March. 

Facing Penn State’s bulldozing 
lineup, 
which 

featured 
four 

top-ranked 
wrestlers, 
the 

Wolverines 
struggled, 
losing all but 
two 
of 
the 

matchups.

The 

Wolverines 
were, however, 
unwilling 
to 

go quietly. Sophomore Garrett 
Sutton, unranked and facing 
the No. 17 wrestler in his weight 
class, 165 pounds, took a close 
one-point loss after asserting 
himself with an early lead. 
Though his opponent, Shakur 
Rasheed, worked his way back to 
a tie, it took a riding time point 
for the Wolverine to earn the 
win.

“He 
did 
a 
nice 
job,” 

McFarland said. “He needs 
to work on bottoms. He gave 
up a riding time point, but I 
thought that he did a nice job 
of competing hard. Garrett just 

wasn’t able to get to his feet 
from the bottom position.”

Pantaleo, 
facing 
the 
top-

ranked wrestler at 149 pounds, 
Zain Retherford, put together 
a 
decent 
outing. 
Though 

McFarland 
mentioned 
that 

Pantaleo was disappointed with 
his performance, the sophomore, 
who mentioned Friday that he 
felt confident about the match, 
held his own against Retherford.

Junior Adam Coon was, as he 

has been all year, a bright spot for 
the Wolverines in an otherwise 
dim outing. He scored a major 
decision over unranked Jan 
Johnson and exhibited a level of 
tactical skill that was indicative 
of his improving status on the 
national stage.

“I thought he did a great 

job,” 
McFarland 
said. 
“He 

wrestled hard and put together 
some different attacks, which 
is always good to see. He had 
some good upper body stuff, 
and was mixing it up well. It 
was good to see him get those 

attacks off.”

Friday’s 

match against 
a 
rebuilding 

Northwestern 
squad 
went 
much 

differently. 
The 
Wolverines 
dominated 
the first half 
of the meet, 

scoring two pins and a major 
decision at the 184, heavyweight 
and 174 categories, respectively. 
Redshirt 
freshman 
Davonte 

Mahomes, ranked 13th at 174, 
shut down Northwestern’s Mitch 
Sliga. Minutes later, Domenic 
Abounader, eighth-best in the 
nation at 184, took down his 
opponent, 
Regis 
Durbin, 
in 

under two minutes.

Fourth-ranked Adam Coon, 

Michigan’s 
heavyweight 

brawler, needed just 40 seconds 
to 
defeat 
Conan 
Jennings, 

finishing out the half. Coon, in 
particular, felt that his victory 

was another step toward his 
championships dreams.

“A national championship is 

the goal, for sure,” Coon said. 
“If I wrestle the way that I’m 
supposed to wrestle and keep 
training the way I am, there’s no 
reason that I can’t be at the top of 
the podium. I just have to make 
sure that I’m focused. I was 
focused today.”

The lone competitive match of 

the half occurred between sixth-
year senior Max Huntley and 
Northwestern’s Jacob Berkowitz. 
Huntley, who is undefeated on 
the season, needed a riding time 
point and a late escape to earn 
the victory.

Michigan 
coach 
Joe 

McFarland 
emphasized 
after 

the match that Huntley showed 
great poise, given the man he 
was wrestling.

“That kid’s hard to wrestle,” 

McFarland said. “He’s a little 
unorthodox at times, and I 
think that threw Max off a little 
bit. I was happy with the way 
that he wrestled, though. He 
kept fighting through positions, 
made some adjustments and got 
a nice win.”

In 
the 
second 
half 
of 

what 
was 
an 
otherwise 

unspectacular meet, the match 
at 149 pounds pitted Michigan’s 
Alec 
Pantaleo 
against 

Northwestern’s best wrestler, 
Jason Tsirtsis. After two back-
and-forth periods, the Wildcat 
took advantage of Pantaleo’s 
apparent finishing issues and 
gained the upper hand, earning 
a takedown in the overtime 
period to secure a win.

“It went back and forth, 

and he just missed on the 
finish in overtime,” McFarland 
said. “Those two had never 
competed against each other 
before, and he’s looking forward 
to a rematch. He made a few 
mistakes, and he knows that. 
Against a guy like him, you just 
can’t afford to make those kinds 
of mistakes. But it was a great 
match, and as I told Alec, it was 
a great, great effort.”

Hometown heroes shine

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

NEW 
YORK 
— 
Saturday 

night, somewhere deep in the 
labyrinth of yellowed walls 
that crisscross the underbelly 
of Madison Square Garden, 
a few men stood tall in their 
black coats as Michigan hockey 
players high-stepped across an 
expansive concrete hangar. The 
staffers watched quietly as soft 
footsteps and biting commands 
from the coaching staff hung 
heavy in the air.

It sounded like anticipation.
Just two nights earlier, the 

Wolverines defeated No. 15 
Penn State, 7-4, for their first 
road win over the Nittany 
Lions since the 2013-14 season. 
Freshman phenom forward Kyle 
Connor talked afterward about 
treating the “Super Saturday” 
matchup — which featured a 
basketball-hockey doubleheader 
at New York’s Madison Square 
Garden — like any other Big Ten 
game.

But that was before the plane 

touched down amid the skyline 
at sunset. It was before the team 
checked into the flashy hotel on 
7th Avenue and before it stepped 
onto the ice under the retired 
jersey of New York Rangers 
captain Mark Messier hanging 
in the rafters.

Trying to block out the 

distractions is understandable, 
but this was more than a Big Ten 
game.

The hometown kids were up 

to the challenge.

Senior forward Boo Nieves, 

a New York Rangers prospect 
hailing from the eastern part of 
the state, made his mark first. 
With the Wolverines trailing 
early 
in 
the 
third, 
Nieves 

fielded the cross-ice pass from 
sophomore defender Sam Piazza 
and buried the puck into the 
netting. Nieves threw his hands 
to the air in what looked to be 
astonishment, 
and 
wheeled 

toward the crowd.

Tie game, 3-3.
Minutes later, Upper Saddle 

River, N.J., native and fellow 
senior Justin Selman beat Penn 
State’s netminder with a quick 
release before tumbling to his 

back and celebrating from the 
ice.

Michigan up, 4-3.
It wouldn’t get any closer 

than that. Michigan goaltender 
Steve 
Racine, 
hailing 
from 

Williamsville, N.Y., put on a 
show in the back half of the 
game. The senior stopped 11 
third-period shots and didn’t 
allow a goal in the final 35 
minutes. 
The 
Wolverines 

finished with a 6-3 victory and a 
statement win.

“We know if it’s not going to 

be you, it’ll be the guy next to 
you,” Selman said. “We have 
faith in that.”

This Michigan team has never 

been short on heroes. Saturday 
night, the seniors stepped up to 
lead a third-period turnaround 
with grit and tenacity.

“There is no question they’ve 

had their ups and downs,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“If you ask Boo how his game 
was here against Cornell in his 
freshman year, it wasn’t very 
good. He really was frustrated 
by being able to play in this 
venue against a tough team. 
And our team didn’t play well, 
Racine didn’t play well, Selman 
didn’t play well — but look at 

them now, they’re completely 
different players.”

If there was one Big Ten 

matchup 
to 
circle 
on 
the 

calendar, this was it. Penn State 
has been playing some of the 
best hockey in the conference 
all year, and the Nittany Lions 
have a recent history of playing 
upset to the Wolverines NCAA 
Tournament hopes.

But Michigan embraced the 

spotlight, playing like a team 
capable of winning a national 
championship. The Wolverines 
outscored 
Penn 
State, 
13-7, 

during the series and seven 
different players recorded a 
tally.

After the weekend sweep, 

Michigan took control of the 
Big Ten lead and leapt to fourth 
place in the PairWise Rankings. 
But the sum of those parts 
doesn’t capture the impact of the 
win. It doesn’t capture the look 
of pure astonishment on Nieves 
face, or of Selman scoring the 
winning goal in front of throngs 
of friends and family.

The Wolverines needed a 

hero heading into the third 
period Saturday, and it could 
have been anyone. But the way it 
happened felt right.

“It went back 
and forth, he 
just missed on 

the finish.”


The big winner, though? 

The Big Ten. In its first real 
taste of exclusively Big Ten 
action — Michigan played two 
non-conference games at MSG 
in 2012 — the five boroughs 
showed it could be a great spot 
for this Power Five conference.

“I think that they speak 

with their feet; they show up at 
games,” Big Ten commissioner 
Jim Delany said on the Big Ten 
Network during a live show at 
a New York bar that attracted 
hundreds of fans on Friday. 
“So it’s a really nice marketing 
agreement with Madison 
Square Garden. We said we 
wanted to be 
part of this 
community. 
It’s a 
competitive 
community. 
It’s one of the 
great sports 
areas in the 
world. We’re 
just trying 
to become 
part of it and 
relevant.”

The conference looked 

awfully relevant Saturday. The 
push to move east has been a hit 
with fans and schools alike. A 
combined 27,387 fans filled the 
Garden for the day’s two games.

“The crowd was great,” said 

Michigan basketball coach John 
Beilein. “They were loud. You 
could really hear them today. 
Michigan travels well. Penn 
State traveled well today. We 
love having our fans from this 
area of the country come out 
and support. They really helped 
us come out and win this game 
today.”

Michigan hockey coach 

Red Berenson thinks the 
trip served a more practical 
purpose: preparing his team to 
potentially play in bigger venues 
in the postseason.

“I think it’s a good 

experience for our players 
and our team as a whole,” 
Berenson said after his team’s 
win. “Hopefully by the end of 
the year, you’re playing in a big 
venue like this, so I want our 
team to be used to it.”

Robert Rosenberg graduated 

from Michigan in 2000 and 
lives in New York now. He’s 
been back to Ann Arbor 
for football games since 
graduating, but hasn’t seen a 
basketball or hockey game in 
more than a decade. Saturday, 
he brought his 7-year-old son 
Danny — who says he’ll be 
playing soccer at Michigan in 
a few short years — to his first 
hockey game.

“This is amazing,” Rosenberg 

said. “Michigan has a huge New 
York population. … It’s great. 
They should do it more often.”

They should do it more often, 

and Saturday was proof. The 
New York crowd was just as 
excited to see pucks fly and 
basketballs go up as it is every 
New Year’s Eve to see the ball 

drop not too 
far away. The 
Garden is set 
to host “Super 
Saturday” 
through 2019. 
Next year, 
Wisconsin 
and Rutgers 
will play in 
basketball, 
and the 
Badgers will 

take on Ohio State in hockey.

With some 85,000 Big Ten 

alumni in Manhattan and 
13,000 Michigan alumni in New 
York City, the conference can’t 
afford to fall asleep on The City 
That Never Sleeps.

After the final horn sounded 

in Michigan’s win on the ice 
over Penn State, Michigan 
alumni belted out “The Victors” 
and Nittany Lions fans sang 
their alma mater.

Perhaps they should steal a 

page from Sinatra, though, and 
sing a new tune.

If I can make it there — I’ll 

make it anywhere — It’s up to 
you — New York, New York.

‘M’ holds off Penn State

Wolverines finish 
off season sweep 

with fourth 
straight win

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

NEW YORK — Shep Garner 

sank a three, and then Davis 
Zemgulis hit another one. All of 
a 
sudden, 

Penn State 
was within 
five points 
of the Michigan men’s basketball 
team with less than five minutes 
to go. After the Wolverines (7-2 
Big Ten, 17-5 overall) controlled 
most of the game, the Nittany 
Lions (2-7, 11-11) gave them a late 
scare.

But then redshirt sophomore 

guard 
Duncan 
Robinson 

responded with a layup, and 
sophomore guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rakhman followed 
with another one to give the 
Wolverines a 68-59 lead. The 
short scare was over, and the 
Michigan 
faithful 
knew 
it, 

starting a “Let’s Go Blue” chant 
that rang through the rafters of 
Madison Square Garden.

Michigan safely controlled 

the Nittany Lions from then 
on out, resulting in a 79-72 
victory in the “The World’s Most 
Famous Arena.”

The late contest wasn’t the 

first time the Wolverines felt 
pressured. Michigan started 
the game with a 7-0 run and 
didn’t allow the Nittany Lions 
to get on the board until almost 
four minutes into the game. 
Penn State soon retaliated, 
though, going on an 8-0 run 
that lasted 3:44 and tied the 
game up at 13.

Junior guard Derrick Walton 

Jr. awakened the Wolverines 
after he chased down Payton 
Banks, stole the ball and took it 
to the opposite end to convert 

on a fast-break layup. It gave 
Michigan a 25-17 lead, all just 
seconds after a possession that 
included a made 3-pointer from 
Aubrey Dawkins.

“I’ve said it time and time 

again, that this group of guys 
is really resilient,” Walton said. 
“Game by game, we’ve given 
runs and withstood runs, we’ve 
never gotten too hot or too low 
within either one, so tonight 
was another great example 
where we couldn’t get a shot in 
a couple possessions in a row … 
then we were able to connect 
on some.

“Just with the character of 

this group, we always know that 
down the road that we have the 
guys who make the big plays.”

The Wolverines played well 

enough in the first half to make 
up for their miscues.

One of their worst showings 

during the Nittany Lions’ 8-0 
run came on three Penn State 
free 
throws 
after 
redshirt 

sophomore 
guard 
Duncan 

Robinson 
fouled 
Isaiah 

Washington on a triple. Just 
before that, Robinson missed 
a 3-pointer of his own on his 
way to 2-for-6 shooting on the 
day. Though Robinson wasn’t 
his typical, sharp-shooting self 
(granted, he sat most of the 
first half after committing two 
fouls early on), junior forward 
Zak Irvin picked up the slack. 
Irvin made the first 3-pointer 
of the game and closed out the 
first half with a buzzer-beating 
triple on his 
way to 7-for-12 
shooting and 
20 points.

When 

Michigan 
faced 
the 

Nittany Lions 
on 
Jan. 
2, 

Walton 
was 

effectively 
shut down on 
offense, scoring just six points. 
He avoided a repeat performance 
at the Garden, however, scoring 

13 points. During the teams’ 
first meeting, Walton was able 
to control Garner and hold 
him to six points on 2-for-
10 shooting, but this time, 

Garner led the 
Nittany Lions 
with 22 points. 
The 
two 

guards 
were 

responsible 
for most of the 
game’s 
late 

excitement.

Penn 
State 

came 
out 

of 
halftime 

firing, making three shots in a 
row, but Michigan was always 
there to retaliate. In the second 

half alone, Irvin and Abdur-
Rakhman 
combined 
for 
17 

points. The Nittany Lions also 
committed 13 fouls, almost twice 
as many as did Michigan, and 
the Wolverines took advantage 
of it, making 23-of-31 shots at 
the line.

“I just think we all knew that 

shots weren’t falling,” Irvin said. 
“So we had to get in the rhythm 
at the free throw line for easy 
buckets.”

The Wolverines won without 

senior 
guard 
Caris 
LeVert, 

who has been sidelined for the 
past eight games with a lower-
leg injury. With the win, they 
remained one game out of first 
place in the Big Ten.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Abdur-Rahkman 
leads Wolverines

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

NEW YORK — Standing at just 

6-foot-3, Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman isn’t exactly a force 
in the paint, but the sophomore 
guard looked like one at times on 
Saturday afternoon at Madison 
Square Garden.

With the Michigan men’s 

basketball team clinging to a 
not-too-comfortable 
seven-

point lead early in the second 
half against Penn State, Abdur-
Rahkman drove to the basket 
and had his shot blocked by the 
Nittany Lions’ Brandon Taylor. 
But instead of abandoning the 
play, Abdur-Rahkman calmly 
grabbed the ball back for an 
offensive rebound and skillfully 
weaved 
through 
multiple 

defenders 
for 
a 
successful 

second layup.

And then late in the second 

half, after Penn State fought 
back to within five points, 
Abdur-Rahkman 
converted 

another contested layup off a 
perfect pass from junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. to bring 
Michigan fans to their feet in 
the divided Garden.

It was that kind of day 

for 
the 
young 
guard, 
who 

Michigan coach John Beilein 
has frequently praised for his 
“East 
Coast”-style 
scoring 

ability. Abdur-Rahkman — who 
wouldn’t even be in the starting 
lineup if not for senior guard 
Caris LeVert’s nagging lower-
leg injury — finished the game 
with 15 points and five rebounds, 
including two offensive boards 
that he followed up with baskets.

Abdur-Rahkman’s impeccable 

post awareness isn’t a new sight 
for the Wolverines, but it was 
especially helpful in a game 
where the Wolverines made just 
six 3-pointers and had a rare size 
advantage over their opponent.

“We couldn’t get a basket 

except for him (early on),” 
Beilein said. “Those were those 
East Coast baskets I talk about. 
He gets into a seam, he pivots 
like three or four times — the 
‘Ali Shuffle’ — and then he ends 
up 
finding 
something. 
He’s 

really good at getting his feet in 
the lane, getting balance.”

With shots not falling from the 

outside like they did in Michigan’s 
first matchup with Penn State on 
Jan. 2 — when the Wolverines 
made 10 3-pointers in the first half 
— Beilein knew that attacking the 
rim was his best option.

“We’re 
gonna 
take 
what 

people give us,” Beilein said, 
“and (the Nittany Lions) were 
switching a lot of screens. We’ve 
been seeing it over and over 
and over again, and we’re still 
scoring points, so we’re finding 
new things to do.”

Saturday, Michigan tended 

toward the first option, with 
Abdur-Rahkman 
leading 
the 

charge.

The overall battle in the paint 

was close — both teams scored 
34 points down low, and Penn 
State 
actually 
outrebounded 

Michigan 36-34. But most of 
the game’s big plays at the rim 
— including multiple converted 
and-1s from junior forwards 
Zak Irvin and Mark Donnal and, 
of 
course, 
Abdur-Rahkman’s 

impressive layups — came from 
the Wolverines.

“(Abdur-Rahkman) has got 

a great feel around the basket 
for a guard,” Beilein said. 
“Obviously, he’s from the state 
of Pennsylvania, so it’s big for 
him when he plays his home 
state. He’s really been a guy that 
I’ve watched just embrace any 
challenges we have — steadily, 
just get more of a mindset that, 
‘College basketball is rough and 
tough, and I’ve gotta roll up my 
sleeves if I wanna play.’ ”

‘M’ sweeps Nittany Lions

Wolverines earn 
long-awaited win 
over Penn State at 

the Garden

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

NEW YORK — It was a situation 

that has become all too familiar to 
the No. 6 Michigan hockey team: 
entering 
the 
third 

period, 
trailing, in 
danger of failing to close out a 
series.

But this one had a little more 

to it. It came in the “World’s 
Most Famous Arena” — Madison 
Square Garden — in front of a 
Penn State-dominated crowd.

And it came against the Nittany 

Lions — the team that has all but 
ruined the Wolverines’ NCAA 
Tournament hopes the past two 
years, the team Michigan went 
1-3 against in the 2014-15 season, 
and the team that bounced the 
Wolverines from the 2014 Big Ten 
Tournament in the first round.

That’s why, in the days leading 

up to the series, a handful of 
Michigan’s players knew they 
“owed one” to the 15th-ranked 
Nittany Lions (6-4-0-0 Big Ten, 
16-7-3 overall).

And behind a senior class — 

one that has arguably known the 
pain inflicted by Penn State the 
most — Michigan (7-1-2-1, 16-3-
4) managed to give the Nittany 
Lions what it felt it owed them, 
capturing a 6-3 victory off a four-
goal third-period effort.

“The big thing was on the 

schedule, we played Penn State, 
we had a lot of respect for Penn 
State,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “They’ve had their 
way with us for the past couple 
of years. I think our team really 
wanted to show that we’re a 
better team than we’ve shown in 
the past.”

For roughly 15 minutes, the 

first period remained scoreless 
— something that has become 
uncharacteristic for the Wolverine 

offense that is leading the nation 
with 4.95 goals per game.

But then the breakthrough 

finally came off the stick of junior 
forward Alex Kile after 14:55 had 
ticked off the clock.

After a quick combination 

between 
sophomore 
forward 

Dexter Dancs and senior forward 
Boo Nieves, Kile got the puck on 
the edge of the left circle and fired 
a quick wrist shot past Penn State 
goaltender Eamon McAdam.

The goal gave Michigan a 1-0 

lead, but that advantage was 
short-lived. Just five minutes 
later, with the Wolverines 42 
seconds away from leaving the 
first period unscathed, Penn 
State forward David Goodwin 
equalized 
the 
game 
off 
a 

deflection in front.

Michigan 
seemed 
unfazed, 

though, as it opened the second 
frame with an answer of its 
own. After going on the penalty 
kill 
immediately 
following 

the 
faceoff, 
the 
Wolverines 

capitalized on Penn State’s costly 
turnover at its offensive blue line.

Junior forward Max Shuart 

picked up the puck and quickly fed 
it to junior forward JT Compher. 
The Wolverine captain went in 
on the breakaway and dangled 
McAdam 
before 
finishing 
it 

coolly with a backhand.

The Nittany Lions countered 

with an equalizer off the stick 
of forward Andrew Sturtz two 
minutes into the frame, before 
forward Ricky DeRosa netted a 
go-ahead goal just under three 
minutes later.

While Michigan closed out the 

rest of the period with a number 
of chances, including a five-shot 
flurry in the final minute, the 
Wolverines entered the third with 
a one-goal hole to climb out of.

That’s when Nieves announced 

himself to the Garden.

Just over two minutes into 

the third period, the New York 
Rangers’ prospect buried the 
puck into an open net after 
receiving a perfect cross-ice pass 
from sophomore Sam Piazza.

“It’s awesome,” Nieves said. 

“To play (at Madison Square 
Garden) for the second time — it’s 
even better this time that we got 

a win. It’s definitely something 
that you keep in the back of your 
mind. But I was more focused on 
getting a team win and making 
sure we take care of things on our 
Michigan end first.”

The game was tied at three. 

The Wolverines had 18 minutes 
to change the script Penn State 
has written for this young rivalry. 
And 
senior 
forward 
Justin 

Selman came up as the man to 
change it.

With 
10:50 
gone 
on 
the 

clock, sophomore forward Tony 
Calderone dished the puck to 
Selman in front. The senior 
fired without hesitation, and lit 
the lamp to give Michigan its 
first lead since the opening two 
minutes of the second period.

From there, junior forward 

Tyler 
Motte 
ensured 
the 

advantage wouldn’t be lost again, 
finding twine with 5:15 left to 
play and adding an open-net goal 
as well, giving the Wolverines a 
6-3 lead.

Though the junior took a hard 

hit late in the third, Berenson 
indicated that he didn’t suffer 
any injuries that will force him to 
miss time.

“We just have a winning 

attitude this year, a never-say-
die attitude,” Selman said. “We 
have a lot of confidence in the 
guys in the room. We know if it’s 
not going to be you, it will be the 
guy next to you. We have faith in 
that. We just keep to what works 
and we’ve seen it work countless 
times now.”

For Michigan, the comeback 

victories seem to be becoming 
the norm. Time after time, the 
Wolverines have leaned on a 
third-period effort to salvage 
points in the Big Ten.

And as Michigan put Penn State 

away in Madison Square Garden 
Saturday night, it was similar to 
all those comeback victories of the 
past in a lot of ways.

But at the same time, this one 

had a little more to it.
