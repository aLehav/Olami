'U' received record-
breaking number of
applications in 2013
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily Staff Reporter
The University's undergradu-
ate enrollment increased slightly
this year, according to figures
released early Monday morning.
Undergraduate enrollment for
fall 2014 totaled 28,395 students,
a 112-student increase from 2013.
This year's freshman class is com-
prised of 6,505 students, 4.5 per-
cent more last fall. The University
also received a record-breaking
49,776 freshman applications,
which represents a 6.3-percent
increase since 2013.
Though undergraduate stu-
dents makeup most of the Univer-
sity's enrollment, totaling about
65.1 percent of the overall student
population, 43,625 students are
currently enrolled, representing
an 85-student drop from 2013.
The University enrolled 15,230
graduate students this year, 197
fewer than last year.
Underre reented .ninor-.
ity stu s make up 10 percent

of this year's freshman class, a
slight decline from 10.6 percent
in fall 2013. However, the num-
ber of underrepresented minor-
ity students in the freshman class
has remained roughly the same
because this year's larger class
size caused their percentage to
decline.
Over the summer, the Universi-
ty appointed KedratIshop as asso-
ciatevicepresidentforenrollment
management, a new position
designed to increase coordination
and communication between the
Office of Undergraduate Admis-
sions, the Office of Financial Aid,
the Office of the Registrar and the
Office of New Student Programs.
In an interview withThe
Michigan Daily, Ishop said she
attributed the increase in under-
graduate enrollment figures to
the University's high ranking
compared to other universities,
saying many similar institutions
have seen a declining number of
applicants in recent years.
"Michigan has always had this
allure for applicants and I think
it's evidenced by the increasing
number of applications," she said.
Last year, members of the
Black Student Union called on

Partnerships aim
to increase Center's
role on campus
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
DailyStaffReporter
In an effort to secure a more
sustainable cycle of funding and
donations, the Center for Entre-
preneurship has paired with two
different venture capital firms to
continue supporting entrepre-
neurial endeavors throughout

Ann Arbor and Michigan,
Seven individuals, five of
whom are affiliated with Michi-
gan eLab and two of whom are
associated with Pinnacle Ven-
tures, have agreed to donate
a percentage of their salaries
to the CFE on an annual basis.
Those from Michigan eLab will
each contribute five percent of
their profits, while those from
Pinnacle will give "a significant
percentage" of earnings, accord-
ing to a release from the CFE.
Michigan eLab, based in Ann
Arbor, and Pinnacle Ventures,

based in Silicon Valley, both
partner with entrepreneurs and
help accelerate their businesses
by providing capital funds and
mentorship in exchange for com-
pany equity.
Dean of Engineering David
Munson said in a press release
that the donations, which have
been coined as a "pay it for-
ward" approach, demonstrate an
entirely new form of giving.
"The 'pay it forward' approach
has at its core a fundamental and
shared value of entrepreneur-
ship," Munson said. "Its effects

will bring students and faculty
into that fold, and significantly
impact the future of entrepre-
neurship education at our college
long-term."
Sarah Bachleda, who heads
marketing and communications
for the CFE, said the goal of the
Center is providing entrepre-
neurship experience.
"That's in classroom, out of
the classroom, mentorship, net-
working," Bachleda said. "(It's)
the whole thing where you're
really getting experimental

Engineering
graduate Derek Tat
passed away Friday
in traffic incident
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily Staff Reporter
Engineering graduate stu-
dent Derek Tat passed away on
Friday in a traffic accident.
Tat, 24, came to the Univer-
sity in January to pursue a Ph.D.
in biomedical engineering. He
had previously received degrees
in mechanical and electrical
,4 engineering at the University
of California, Berkeley and had
worked in the private sector.
Cynthia Chestek, an assis-
tant professor of biomedical
engineering, worked closely
with Tat in a laboratory setting,
researching brain control and
prosthetic care. Chestek said
she was excited to begin work-
ing with Tat even before he
arrived, saying he was the
strongest applicant she had ever
encountered.
"I had never seen an applica-
tion like that," she said. "I was
so excited when he decided to
come to my lab."
According to Chestek, Tat
was a dedicated and passionate
researcher, frequently work-
ing overtime in the lab. He also
took on demanding course load
in addition to his research.
Chestek said she was devas-
tated by Tat's death, noting he
WEATHER HI: 55
TOMORROW LO: 28

was a good person and friend as
well as an enthusiastic lab assis-
tant. She said his intense focus
and minimalist approach to life
could serve as inspiration for
everyone - to take every minute
for what it's worth.
Chestek said Tat planned to
graduate early and eventually
become a professor focusing on
robotic control and prosthet-
ics. He had also written several
papers on his research, which
Chestek hopes will be published
posthumously.
"There was no question he
was going to be immensely suc-
cessful," she said. "We were
shocked."
Jennifer J. Linderman,
associate dean for graduate
education in the College of
Engineering, sent an e-mail to
inform the college community
of his passing.
"The community is certainly
reacting with shock and sad-
ness over his death," Linderman
wrote. "It was a terrible, terri-
ble accident and our sympathies
go out to the family."
The College of Engineering
hosted a ceremony to honor
Tat's life Monday evening. Tat's
parents and sister joined the
community for the ceremony.
A memorial service will also
be held in the coming weeks.
"He was incredibly talented,
incredibly hardworking, and
incredibly generous with his
time," Linderman wrote. "Peo-
ple describe him as a real leader.
He was really going places."

Counci to exand city's non-
lsCminat1o ordinance

Changes impact
employment
protections, living
wage requirements
By GENEVIVE HUMMER
For theeDaily
The Ann Arbor City Council
unanimously approved amend-
ments to both the city's'Non-
Discrimination Ordinance and
the Living Wage Ordinance at
their meeting Monday.
Non-Discrimination
Ordinance
The Council's unanimous
decision to expand the city's
Non-Discrimination Ordinance
drew cheers from those in atten-
dance.

The amendment, sponsored
by the city's Human Rights
Commission and Councilmem-
bers Jack Eaton (D-Ward 4),
Sumi Kailasapathy (D-Ward 1),
Christopher Taylor (D-Ward 3),
Margie Teall (D-Ward 5) and
Chuck Warpehoski (D-Ward 5),
seeks to improve non-discrim-
ination protections in housing
and employment by changing
the wording of the existing
ordinance to include provisions
regarding gender expression
and identity, veteran status, vic-
tims of domestic violence, polit-
ical alignment, arrest record
and familial status.
Kailasapathy, the Council's
liaison on the city's Human
Rights Commission, said it's
important for Ann Arbor to be a
leader inensuringhuman rights
for its citizens, but he said he
believes it hasn't fulfilled that
goal.

"The state of Michigan is lag-
ging behind in many aspects
of non-discrimination and the
equality of marriage," Kailasa-
pathy said in an interview with
The Michigan Daily. "I feel at
least at a city level if we can set
the gold standard then we are
doing good."
During public hearings on
the amendment, representa-
tives from the National Asso-
ciation for the Advancement
of Colored People, the Univer-
sity's Sexual Assault Preven-
tion and Awareness Center, the
transgender community and
the SafeHouse Center, a sup-
port organization for survivors
of domestic violence and sexual
assault, urged councilmembers
to approve the ordinance.
State Rep. Adam Zemke (D-
Ann Arbor) also voiced his sup-
port for the amendment in an

boutique hopes to

the Ann Arbor business
scene is known for its turn-
over - and boutiques are no
exception.
Pink Pump, for instance,
closed its East Liberty Street
doors in the beginning of 2013
with patrons blaming high
prices and inconsistent hours.
Chains such as Pitaya, Urban
Outfitters and American
Apparel are some of the few
stores that prosper in the State
Street area, as student budgets
might not allow for the pricier
clothes in local boutiques.
When Verbena owner Kate
Duerksen opened her cloth-
ing store in August of this
year, she had her work cut out
for her. The business opened
its doors at 309 S. State St. on
Aug. 16.
All About Blue, which sold
University spirit-wear, occu-
pied the space until The M
Den bought out the business.
Duerksen managed All About

agreement, the Duerksens
kept 1,500 square feet of the

Mayoral candidate sets
priorities for Ann Arbor

Taylor to focus
on balancing
issues, improving
transportation
By JACK TURMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
As Ann Arbor's mayoral elec-
tion quickly approaches, City
Councilmember Christopher Tay-
lor (D-Ward 3) has been prioritiz-
ing the main issues he would like
to resolve if elected as mayor in
November.
Taylor, the Democratic nomi-
nee, said he would like to address
a variety of issues to ensure that
Ann Arbor has affordable living
conditions, not focusing on any
particular aspect of the city.
"My goal is to confront the city
with balance, to strive to maintain
and improve basic services, while
at the same time making tangible

quality of life improvements," he
said.
Taylor has demonstrated an
interest in a multitude of issues
during his six years on City Coun-
cil, sponsoring legislation ranging
fromtransportationto downtown
development and zoning. In this
vein, Taylor said he will focus on
ensuring maintenance of pub-
lic safety matters and work to
improve streets and municipal
infrastructure.
While Taylor said all of these
issues are important, he added
that transportation is an areathat
has the most opportunities for
improvement and reinvestment.
He also emphasized the impor-
tance of transportation in Ann
Arbor during the firstpost-prima-
ry debate.
Taylor said transportation
infrastructure, including that for
non-motorized modes of trans-
portation such as walking and bik-
ing, needs to be updated to make
traveling easier and more acces-

sible.
"Traffic is a concern to resi-
dents," he said. "We need to make
sure that people can come in and
out of the city efficiently and
effectively."
With regard to walking and
biking, Taylor said non-motorized
transportation is a vital compo-
nentofAnnArbor'stransportation
infrastructure. He has focused on
the importance of non-motorized
transportation by sponsoring leg-
islation that required City Admin-
istrator Steve Powers to develop
a non-motorized transportation
implementation strategy in 2013.
"Making sure our bike lanes
improve and expand is a co-equal
concern when designing streets
and crosswalks," Taylor said.
Along with updating transpor-
tation infrastructure, Taylor has
supported the expansion of mass
transit services since the spring,
specifically regarding the Ann
Arbor Area Transit Authority.
Additionally, he supports the con-
struction of a new A mtrak train

station, an initiative that is still in
the planning process.
While working on expand-
ing mass transit services, Taylor
would also like to see the growth
of ridesharing services such as
Uber and Lyft in Ann Arbor.

es safely throughout the country
2 5 3 9 and I'd like to see Ann Arborites
continue to have the benefit of
their operation," he said.

legislation that required Powers

ment with transportation net-
3 2 8 workcompanies. Taylor said he is
unaware of whether Powers has

5 ing agreement.
Even though the improvements
6 8 4 3 to mass transit services and ride-
sharing services have not been

he is looking forward to exploring
these opportunities to ensure that

He did not provide a timeline

these problems because of the
complex governmental process.

Top Shiite cleric
lends support to
government's fight
against extremists
BAGHDAD (AP) - Iraq's top
Shiite cleric on Monday gave his
support to the new government
battling the Islamic State group
as militants unleashed a wave of
deadly attacks on the country's
majority Shiite community, kill-
ing at least 43 people.
The blitz by the militants this
summer plunged Iraq into its
worst crisis since U.S. troops left
at the end of 2011. While there
was no claim of responsibility for
Tuesday's attacks, they seemed
likely calculated by the group to
sow fear among Iraqis and keep
pressure on the new Shiite-led
government in Baghdad.
Prime Minister Haiderual-Aba-
di, who took office last month,
met Monday with top Shiite cleric
Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in
the southern city of Najaf. He said
after their talks that al-Sistani
welcomed the recent formation

of the government that Al-Abadi
now leads.
The spiritual leader wields
considerable influence among
Iraq's Shiite majority, and the
meeting carried symbolic sig-
nificance because al-Sistani has
shunned politicians in recent
years to protest how they run the
country.
"We have a long and hard mis-
sion ahead of us," al-Abadi told
reporters after emerging from
the meeting with the cleric, who
is believed to be 86 years old.
"One of the missions is related to
security. We need arms and we
need to reconstruct our security
forces."
Al-Sistani lives in the Shiite
holy city of Najaf, 160 kilometers
(100 miles) south of Baghdad, and
rarely appears in public.
The day's attacks killed dozens
in Baghdad and the Shiite holy
city of Karbala.
Inthe capital, the bomber blew
himself up among Shiite wor-
shippers as they were leaving a
mosque in a central commercial
area after midday prayers Mon-
day. That blast killed at least 17
people and wounded 28, a police

officer said.
In Karbala, four separate
car bombs went off simultane-
ously, killing at least 26 people
and wounding 55, another police
officer said. The city, about 90
kilometers (55 miles) south of
Baghdad, is home to the tombs of
two revered Shiite imams and the
site of year-round pilgrimages.
The explosives-laden cars were
parked in commercial areas and
parking lots near government
offices, the officer added.
Medical officials confirmed
the casualty figures. All officials
spoke on condition of anonymity
as they were not authorized to
talk to media.
The attacks in Baghdad and
Karbala, the latest in relentless
assaults that have challenged the
Shiite-led government, came a
day after a suicide bombing tar-
geted another Shiite mosque in
the Iraqi capital, killing 28 peo-
ple.
The latest attacks bore the hall-
marks of the Islamic State group,
which has recently claimed sev-
eral other large bombings in
Baghdad and elsewhere, particu-
larly in Shiite areas.

SURUC, Turkey
Turkey says it
helps Kurdish
fighters enter Syria
Turkey said it was helping
Iraqi Kurdish fighters cross into
Syria to support their brethren
fighting Islamic State militants
in a key border town, although
activists inside embattled Koba-
ni said no forces had arrived by
Monday evening, raising ques-
tions about whether the mission
was really underway.
The statement by Turkey's
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavu-
soglu came hours after the U.S.
airdropped weapons and ammu-
nition to resupply Kurdish fight-
ers for the first time. Those
airdrops Sunday followed weeks
of airstrikes by a U.S.-led coali-
tion in and near Kobani.
After a relative calm, heavy
fighting erupted in the town
as dusk fell, with the clatter
of small arms and tracer fire,
as well as the thud of mortar
rounds and big explosions of two
airstrikes that resounded across
the frontier.

ENROLLMENT
From Page 1
the University administration to
adopt several measures to foster
inclusion on campus and improve
diversity, including a demand
to increase Black enrollment to
10 percent of the overall student
population. This year, Black stu-
dents make up 4.63 percent of
the graduate and undergraduate
student body, according to data
provided by the Office of the Reg-
istrar. Enrollment percentages for
Hispanic and Native American
students are 5.14 percent and .21
percent, respectively.
Figures provided by the Office
of Budget and Planning are slight-
ly larger, since they break down
a federal category that sepa-
rates students who identify as
more than one race. This data set
shows the University's total Black
enrollment is 5.8 percent.
In January, University Pro-
vost Martha Pollack announced
a package of initiatives designed
to address diversity and inclusion,
including the creation of a new
administrative position focused
on increasing minority retention
and recruitment.
But constrained in part by Pro-
posal 2, the 2006 ballot initiative
that banned the consideration of
race in college admissions, among
other factors, the University has
struggled to increase minority
enrollment. Black students made
up 4.65 percent of the under-
graduate population in fall 2013,
compared to 7 percent in fall
2006. However, race and ethnic-
ity reporting categories changed
to comply with federal reporting
guidelines after 2010, meaning
the figures are not entirely com-
parable.
Ishop said there is still work to
be done to improve racial diver-
sity on campus, but added that the
University is responding to stu-
dent concerns by engaging them
in conversation related to the
admissions process.

Though she had faith in the
University's commitment to
increasing diversity on campus,
she said seeing results from the
new initiatives and achieving
racial diversity are part of an
ongoing process.
"This is a long-term solution,"
Ishop said. "It's not just about
bringing bodies to campus, but it's
about finding students who want
to go to Michigan and engaging
them on campus and making sure
they have a positive and fruitful
environment."
For the eighth consecutive
year, the University received a
record number of applicants. The
University accepted 15,985 stu-
dents - approximately 32 per-
cent of the students who applied
- down rate about 1 percent from
last year.
Though the University nor-
mally admits more students than
it plans to enroll since many
accepted students choose other
schools, about 500 more students
enrolled in this year's entering
class than University officials
anticipated.
The over-enrollment also
placed additional strain on Uni-
versity residence halls, causing a
shortage of emergency housing.
Ishop said the University plans
to curb enrollment over the next
few years by limitingearly admis-
sions in order to accommodate for
a potentially greater "yield," the
number of students who matricu-
late after being accepted to the
University.
In response to growing enroll-
ment numbers over the past
decade, Pollack announced a
plan at the Sept. 18 meeting of the
University's Board of Regents to
reduce the size of future fresh-
man classes, including a recom-
mendation to shift more early
applicants to the waitlist.
"We have been over-enrolling
every year for the past five years
and we have to stop this,"she said.
"I'm not happy about it."

VERBENA
From Page 1
Collection, which is owned by
the M Den, is the second tenant
in the lease.
Duerksen graduated from
Michigan State University with
a degree in interior design and
transformed the former spirit
shop into a fashion hub.
Verbena is working to appeal
to the college student budget
and to a wide range of styles,
Duerksen said.
"It doesn't have to be expen-
sive to be fashionable," Duerk-
sen said. "The student price line
is probably the first thing we
look for while buying."
The store caters to a host of
tastes, which Kate described as
urban, bohemian and earthy. In
addition to selling clothes, Ver-
bena offers unusual wares such
as rustic mermaid bottle open-
ers, knick-knack dishes, globes,
local crafts and even small
plants - yes, succulents are sold
among mini-skirts.
"I've been, from the begin-

ning, envisioning the college girl
and what you can do to make
your dorm room your own,"
Duerksen said.
Clothing, jewelry and decora-
tive products create a vibe that
is unique to the boutique.
"We're quite a few things,"
Duerksen said. "I think it's impor-
tant (while choosing merchan-
dise) to look for more than just
your own style and branch out."
Shortly after opening, Infor-
mation junior Samantha Coff-
man approached Duerksen and
offered to help the store connect
with students through social
media.
"They hadn't had alot of pub-
licity yet on campus," Coffman
said. "And I kind of know the
demographic."
Coffman developed a social
media plan for Verbena, which
included promoting the busi-
ness on Facebook, Pinterest,
Instagram and Twitter. Coff-
man said although she helped
shape the store's advertising
strategy, she sees herself more
as an event planner.
"They want to imitate thaft

for the future," Coffman said.
"That's kinda where my role
more is rather than just daily
social media, but I definitely
think my official position is
I advise on social media and
how they should be approach-
ing it."
For example, Verbena recent-
ly hosted a Greek life-exclusive
event that offered sorority
members a 15-percent discount
on merchandise. Duerksen said
although this event was not
open to non-Greek life mem-
bers, she hopes to host many
more events for anyone who is
interested.
In line with hosting events
for students, the store's broader
marketing strategy focuses on
appealing to locals first. How-
ever, Coffman said this is just
the start.
"Our goal for the future is to
have the social media grow so
much that the business grows as
a brand outside of Ann Arbor,"
Coffman said. "And to getecom-
merce going for the boutique
so it's profitable not just in Ann
Arbor, but online."


COUNCIL
From Page 1
e-mail statement, which Taylor
readfofh6Council.
"The non-discrimination ordi-
nance before you tonight is not
just the right thing to do, it is by
extension necessary," the e-mail
read.
While the new ordinance was
widely praised, Councilmember
Mike Anglin (D-Ward 5) point-
ed out that this is just one step
in the larger fight for universal
equality.
Living Wage Ordinance
The Council also discussed
the resolution to exempt human
services nonprofits from the Liv-
ing Wage Requirement in City
Contracts and Grants, a measure
sponsored by Sabra Briere (D-
Ward 1) and Eaton.
The Living Wage Ordinance
mandates that companies that
have contracts with the city
must pay employees $12.17 per
hour if they provide health care
benefits, and $13.57 per hour if
they do not. Currently, nonprofit
organizations are required to
abide by the city's Living Wage
Ordinance.
Councilmember Sally Hart
Petersen (D-Ward 2) said non-
profits were required to follow
the ordinance because the city
provides support to many non-
profits. However, she said this
expectation is flawed.

"Being nonprofits, they can-
not always afford to pay market
rates," she said in an interview
with the Daily.
As a result, many nonprof-
its have 'requested that the City
Council revise this requirement.
While the city's Housing and
Human Services Advisory Board
suggested that all nonprofits
with annual city contracts of
$10,000 or more abide by the
Living Wage Ordinance, Peters-
en proposed raising this thresh-
old to $25,000.
In their report, the HHSAB
concluded that raising the
threshold to $25,000 would not
be effective.
"Such an amendment would
have no positive effect, but
would only exempt agencies that
have not asked for an exemption
and may not need it," the report.
However, in his review of the
HHSAB recommendations, City
Administrator Steve Powers
refuted these claims.
"Matching the threshold for
Living Wage compliance to con-
tracts $25,000 and over would
align the Living Wage with
the City Charter's standard for
City Council approval of con-
tracts and procurement policy.
The City's procurement process
would be simplified and be more
efficient," he said.
Ultimately, the Council unani-
mously passed the ordinance
revision with exemptions begin-
ning at the $25,000 threshold.

INVESTORS
From Page 1
learning that puts you in the
shoes of the entrepreneur and
makes you an entrepreneur
yourself."
University alumni Rick
Bolander and Bob Stefan-
ski, both managing directors of
Michigan eLab, are two of the
seven donors.
Bolander said the move by a
group of working professionals
to commit a portion of their sal-
ary to a university on a regular
basis is unprecedented.
"The entire management
team is basically gifting that
profit of their bottom line to a
third-party entity," Bolander
said. "I've never heard of anyone
doing that with any univer-
sity before."
Bolander, who was a CFE
board member and helped
develop the "pay it forward" <
initiative, said the idea's
inspiration came from his
experiences as a student at
the University, where finan-
cial aid played a large role in
his ability to attend.
He added that because the
"rich experience at Michi-
gan ... exists predominantly
outside of the classroom," it
is important that resources
like the CFE have ongoing
funding to encourage stu-
dents' creativity and entre-
preneurial spirit.
"Entrepreneurship is as
much about collecting the
best and brightest talent in a
concentrated way and over-
laying a culture on top of that
that allows for great things
to happen," Bolander said.
"When you create a culture
of expectation, of disruptive
education and greatness, you
trap people who want to be
there in that world."
Stefanski, a current CFE
board member, said the
focus on entrepreneurship
at the University has blos-
somed since his attendance
in the 1980s. He added that
he wants to promote the idea
that entrepreneurship is not
limited to tech startups, and
feels that the pay-it-forward

donations reflect this notion.
"When we talk about entre-
preneurship ... that doesn't
necessarily just mean starting
Google," he said. "That includes
social entrepreneurship. That
includes civil rights. That
includes people that are thought
leaders and being entrepreneur-
ial and paving the way in all
sorts of facets of life."
In the spirit of the diversity
of entrepreneurship, Bolander
and Stefanski said there will
be an opportunity for individu-
als to specify specifically what
their donations will go toward,
though currently the donations
will go directly to the CFE. For
example, both said they would
have an interest in endowing
student scholarships angled
toward entrepreneurship.

"In my mind, that is very
much what this is all about,"
Stefanski said. "If we can cre-
ate a greater culture where we
have more people saying, 'I'm
going to pay a portion of my
future profits back to the Uni-
versity,' you have a much more
sustainable or ongoing flow of
resources."
Bolander said he hopes this
system of donation will lead to
higher accessibility to post-sec-
ondary education.
He called today's education
costs "untenable," and said they
are responsible for creating a
"caste system" that excludes
others. He added that in the
future, he'd like for all students
at the University with a grade
point average above 3.0 to not
have to pay for schooling.

MADELINE HIGGINS WQ
Continuing the conversation

eaving my 11 a.m. class on Friday
left me feeling comparatively more
reflective than I was tired - a rare
occurrence on a Friday
afternoon. My large
class was assigned a
reading pertaining to
instances of sexual
assault against women
in fraternity houses.
When the study was
brought up in my dis-
cussion on Friday, an RENNIE
intellectual conver- PASQUINELLI
sation was spurred,
composed of a range
of comments and opinions. What caught my
attention in particular was when a boy who
had yet to participate in class dialogue this
semester volunteered his opinion, disagree-
ing with the general consensus of the study
and warning women thatthey should be more
worried about getting raped in downtown
Detroit than they should be in Ann Arbor.
The class, made up mostly of female stu-
dents,hadno specifically articulatedresponse
to this. There seemed to be an agreement
that women should have a heightened fear
of sexual assault in Detroit as opposed to our
campus, and then the class turned the subject
away from the newest participant's comment.
Later, I received an e-mail from my GSI clari-
fying a pretty important concept that wasn't
discussed in class, citing statistics from the
article we were assigned to read: "Women
are more likely to be raped by acquaintances
... places like college parties and bars are far
more dangerous for women." So no, women
do not have to be more afraid of Detroit or any
other city more than Ann Arbor just because
of comparative crime rates.
Obviously not everybody does his or her
reading, but I was surprised that this e-mail
needed to be sent. I was under the impression
that most educated people know that rape/
sexual assault is most common among men
and women who already know each other. I
shared this view with my close male friend.
After the conversation I hadwithhim, I could
guess that he, along with most males, didn't
enjoy discussing the heightened chance
for female sexual assault when with their
male friends.
Oftentimes, males are overly defensive in
regard to rape and sexual assault statistics
that portray them in a negative light.
And for a long time, I thought this was
because of the way these statistics were
being discussed in the media and in academic

spaces. After a consideration of the in-class
discussionthough, I thinkthat logic gets back
at the victim blame game. A woman should
not be blamed for her experience of sexual
assault because she wore less clothing than
she normally does or because she drank too
much alcohol. Similarly, women should not be
blamed for men's over-defensive tactics when
they portray information about rape and
sexual assault. Simply stating that instances
of rape and sexual assault are more likely to
occur amongst friends and not strangers is in
no way an attack on a male, unless he raped or
assaulted somebody.
As is to be expected, there aren't any
statistics that support this opinion, but any
time I have ever engaged in discourse about
the prominence of sexual assault amongst
acquaintances and friends with a self-
identified heterosexual man, it turns into
a one-sided debate. The one-sided part is
the male defending himself against these
statistics, acting as though facts are some sort
of personal attack.
No, these conversations aren't intended to
portray you as a terrible person or potential
rapist. But these conversations are created
to prevent future instances of sexual assault
from happening. Emotional undertones are
inevitable in the presentation of the facts
in a discussion-type conversation about an
emotionally loaded topic. Women shouldn't
be ashamed of expressing feelings when they
discuss instances of rape and assault. Men,
in turn, shouldn't be offended by facts that
sound emotionally charged.
I'm not saying yelling facts about rape and
other forms of sexual violence in a heated and
accusatory tone is the best way to get one's
point across. Actually, that is definitely an
ineffective way of getting any point across. The
difference between having civilized discourse
about important issues like sexual assault
and yelling about them is pretty clear and not
necessary to explain.
So, if these types of conversations are
important to any women out there (which they
should be), it should be easy to decide what is
thebestpathto pursue to maintainan educated
and non-aggressive conversation with a man.
At the same time, don't be afraid to correct
anyone with incorrect and offensive "facts"
about statistics and examples of sexual abuse.
It's important to have conversations about
these topics. Not to single out a particular man,
or an entire sex, but to educate.

Like many other socially
conscious humans on campus, I
made the trek to North Campus last
Friday night to see "Good Kids," a
production sponsored by the Big
Ten Theatre Consortium's New Play
Initiative. The show tells the story of
Chloe, a high school student who is
raped byhighaschool football players.
The rapists document the assault on
social media, but Chloe is drunk and
does not remember the incident.
Through the lens of social media,
the narrator goes back in time and
shows how "that night" unfolded.
The acting was phenomenal and
the play was a polished production.
However, by the end of "Good Kids,"
I felt uneasy about the neglected
pieces of the portrayed narrative,
but I was unable to fully articulate
what I thought was missing. After
an evening of No Thai, "The Office"
and a good night of sleep, I was able
to give a voice to the parts that I
thought "Good Kids" left unsaid.
First and foremost, "Good
Kids" is a University-sponsored
performance. Any form of activism
that is underwritten by any form of
institution is influenced bythe values
and agenda of said institution. The
School of Music, Theatre & Dance
page describes the Big Ten New
Play Initiative as an opportunity
for commissioned work by female
playwrights featuring strong
female leads. However, its first play
is about a survivor of rape. Rape
is one of the most dehumanizing,
degrading and violent actions, which
disproportionally affects women.
In my opinion, the play failed to
show its female lead Chloe as a
strong survivor; she appeared weak,
crumbling under the weight of her
experience. Other characters also
blamed Chloe's friend for leaving
Chloe alone during the party. The
emphasis placed on the vulnerability
and culpability of the female
characters in "Good Kids" is a sexist
depiction, making me question the
supposed "strong female lead."
"Good Kids" is set in a small town
and the characters are high school
students. However, the intended
audience is college students. If the
aim was to be relatable to college stu-
dents, why not use a college setting?
Don't we have enough stories about

rapes on college campuses, including
sexual assault at parties?
Our own campus nightmare
unfolded just last year as the public
discovered former Michigan kicker
Brendan Gibbons' sexual assault.
The aftermath was less than
satisfying. Gibbons was released
from the team at the end of the
season and there was little student
protest of his ability to play while
he was still on the team. More
recently, thousands of students have
signed a petition to fire our current
Athletic Director, David Brandon, in
reaction to the injuries sophomore
quarterback Shane Morris sustained
after an unwise placement back in
the Minnesota game. Students, along
with the University of Michigan
football program, seem to value
the health of a concussed football
player over the rights and wellness
of a survivor of sexual assault. Given
this recent past of sexual assault and
unfair play, the University seems to
distance themselves from college
experiences of sexual assault with
the high school setting in "Good
Kids," which is more removed from
the politics of collegiate football.
The play further distances
itself from the students through
the difficulty of accessing "Good
Kids." First, the play was in North
Campus' Arthur Miller Theater,
instead of the more centrallylocated
and larger Mendelssohn Theater.
Secondly, the ticket price was $10
(which also could be subsidized by
a Passport to the Arts). Thirdly, the
play was poorly advertised. Because
of these barriers to accessing
the play, the crowd consisted of
people in the community who
were already aware of the social
issues surrounding sexual assault.
Furthermore, the latter half of the
performances offered were during
fall break, when many students go
home, take trips, buckle down to
study for midterms or are otherwise
unavailable to see a play.
Beyond the context of the produc-
tion, by using a privileged narrative
of a white, middle-class, skinny, het-
erosexual women, the production
did nothing to highlight more com-
mon stories of sexual assault, which
include identities such as women
of color, LGBTQ*-identifying indi-

viduals, college-aged students and
many others' identities. Below are
three examples of how "Good kids"
erased the narrative of some of
the most frequent and least heard
sexual assaults.
According to the depiction of
Chloe in "Good Kids," women
targeted for rape wear provocative
clothing. I would disagree: You
don't have to be pretty, skinny,
white or wearing revealing clothes
to be raped. In contrast, one in
four women on college campuses
has experienced sexual assault,
and I can guarantee that most
survivors do not fit into all or
even a mix of those privileged
identities. In fact, women of color
are disproportionately represented
in sexual violence, specifically,
African American, Native
American, and mixed-race women.
You don't have to be raped by a
stranger. According to the Rape,
Abuse and Incest National Network,
80 to 90 percent of survivors know
their assailants. The stranger
rape, as Chloe experienced, is not
the majority of cases; women are
raped by family members, friends
and acquaintances.
Only 5 percent of college rapes
are reported. Instead of the social
media blowup presented in "Good
Kids," many survivors suffer in
silence, not wanting to experience
the horrific aftermath of slut-
shaming by community members,
police and their assailants as shown
in "Good Kids."
Statistics show many people on
campus have experienced versions
of "that night," whether they were
assaulted themselves, or they've
heard stories of "that night" from
their friends, family members or
the media. It is very important to
acknowledge survivors' stories and
their silence, their suffering and
their strength. When performing a
single narrative of rape, as in "Good
Kids," it is especially important
to be sensitive to the prevalent
narrative and to avoid perpetuating
misconceptions. Unfortunately,
"Good Kids" demonstrated that the
most frequent narratives are the
narratives left untold.

[ E R TO THE ELI lIO SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

It's time to step up
TO THE DAILY:
Weeks ago, a Michigan State University
student was walking to class and was hit by a
car in the crosswalk. He was thrown onto the
windshield, his body broke the mirror off the
car, and he landed 10 feet away. The driver did
stop but seemed more interested in her broken
mirror than the person she hit. No one helped
this young man or offered to call for help! He
was disoriented, had a headache for three days,
an arm injury and was very sore. The student
has said, "I do really wish that a bystander
would have stepped in when it all happened;
however, everyone just went about going to
class once they saw me up and walking."
That same week, a fellow Big Ten
student was hit by a football player, his
head snapping, and he got up, wobbly, on
his feet. Unfortunately, no one stepped up
immediately to help Michigan quarterback
Shane Morris either, despite thousands of
people advocating for him in the form of
booing to the football staff. I was in the stands,
screaming at the top of my lungs on behalf of
this student.
Both of these Big Ten students deserve

better. As a society, we have become too
complacent and do not step up to help others.
When you see someone get hurt in front of
you, why don't you take action? I know it is
scary to get involved, but someone's life may
be on the line, and you can make a difference.
After a bowl game pep rally years ago, a
car crash happened right in front of the van
I was in with fellow college football fans. Our
van pulled over, and we helped the injured
grandpa and grandson whose car flipped over.
We called 911 while the lady who caused the
crash took off. The grandpa was taken to the
hospital, and his car was totaled. When we
got back in our van, we were all quiet, and
someone said, "That puts this football game
into perspective."
Let's all vow to do the right thing and
step up when action needs to be taken. Ask
if someone needs help or call 911 to have
others assist them. After all, it may be you
one day who needs help, and hopefully
a fellow human being will step up to
assist you!

Stop looking over your shoulder,
Jessie Ware avoids
sophomore slump

UK R&B star
returns with sexy
'Tough Love'
By MELINA GLUSAC
For The Daily
Tired, familiar, boring -
that's the sophomore slump.
Many artists fall into it and
can't get
back up. A-
And that's
what British Tough Love
technodiva
Jessie Ware Jessie Ware
seems keen PMR Records
to avoid,
as if she's
never heard those words strung
together. She's back - after
her critically-acclaimed first
album, Devotion - and better,
crisper and sexier than ever.
Tough Love is a sultry, intimate
journey through the more des-
perate phase of love, and Ware's
sultry R&B vocals illuminate
this glistening compilation of,
well, sheer electronic genius.
What's cool about Ware is
her fluidity - she doesn't eon-
fine herself to a genre and
is therefore more success-
ful, more progressive. Songs
like "Kind of ... Sometimes ...
Maybe" and "Keep on Lying"
are prime examples of this art.
The melodies, discounting all
added elements, are distinc-

tively R&B, and it's easy to
imagine chanteuses like Mary
J. Blige or Keyshia Cole work-
ing their magic on them. But
Ware's unique techno infusion
- synths, quirky sound bites
and irresistible drums - make
each tune fresh and exciting.
It's Ware's world, and it works
for her.
The album maintains a cer-
tain funkiness throughout its 43
minutes, an interesting consis-
tency the listener will appreciate.
That's not to say it gets boring,
though. The title track and first
single, "Tough Love," is a Prince-
esque, minimalistic groove, and
atmospheric back-up mixed
with soulful falsetto make it one
of the strongest tracks. Songs
like "Champagne Kisses" and
"Sweetest Song" follow suit, each
equally as passionate, though
maybe not as memorable. Just
when it seems the listener has
Ware pegged, though, she sur-
prises them with "Say You Love
Me," an acoustically supported,
sexy ballad co-penned by mas-
ter of desperation Ed Sheeran. It
sounds like a Sheeran song (same
chord progression as his new
single, "Thinking Out Loud"), but
in the grand scheme of Ware's
album, it's a fun plot twist in the
stripped-down direction, com-
plete with a gospel choir near the
final crescendo.
And Ware offers several
songs that highlight her marvel-
ous voice. It shines the most on

"Pieces," a slow, sensuous, seri-
ous number with Ware croon-
ing, "I had to shatter to pieces
/ You made me reveal myself,
reveal myself / So if you no lon-
ger need them / Then give them
to someone else." She laces even
the saddest of lyrics with a "diva"
vocal inflection, citing power-
houses like Whitney Houston
and Mariah Carey as some of her
biggest inspirations. That admi-
ration shows in the subtle vocal
runs and pure, natural power
she emits on almost every track
- even the softer ones - and
this, once again, is what sets her
apart from the wannabes. It feels
effortless.
Ware cools it down on "You
& I (Forever)," a whispery siren
song co-produced by Ware's
male vocal soulmate, Miguel. It's
justifiably decent, but the cho-
rus sounds like a typical Katy
Perry-ish pop song and is not as
interesting as the others - good
thing the verses, intro and cool
synths distract from it.
She hasn't hit it big in the
U.S. yet, but this sophomore
album is wise in closing with
"Desire," an echo-y, booming
number that reflects the tone
of the album. Soulful and mys-
terious, it drips with emotion
and sensuality while remaining
extremely listenable. "Desire"
fades out with Ware pleading "...
and I need you ... and I need you."
Some tough love for America:
we need Ware.

'he K nick'stuns in
first season finale

Soderbergh's turn-
of-the-century
drama comes to a
shocking close
By DREW MARON
Daily Arts Writer
This review contains major
spoilers from this season of
"The Knick."
In the
season A+
finale of
Cinemax's The Knick
stunning Season Finale
new series
"The Cinemax
Knick," Dr.
Thackery
(Clive Owen, "Sin City: A Dame
To Kill For") kills a young
woman during an experimental
procedure. Was it the. cocaine-
in his blood, or was there a
greater flaw in the procedure?
By the end of "Crutchfield,"
the only thing we're left with
are dreadful ambiguities
- Algernon's current state
following his beating, Barrow's
debt to Wu and uncertainty
all the characters face as the
Knick looks to move uptown.
"The Knick," as of right
now, is the best new show
on television, and certainly
the only new show that can
join the ranks of "elite" cable
programming such as fellow
newcomer "True Detective."
The show's finale mirrored
its shocking beginning
flawlessly. We began with
one of the most grotesque
sequence of events to take
place on television. Within the
first five minutes of the series,
we see a gruesomely failed
C-section with both mother
and child dead, followed by
the suicide of acting surgeon
Dr. Christiansen (Matt
Frewer, "Orphan Black").
Now, in "Crutchfield," the
season finale, Dr. Thackery
hopes to make a breakthrough,
using his own blood in
an experimental blood
transfusion. Unfortunately,

he doesn't consider the levels
of cocaine in his blood and the
impact it'll have on the young
girl. Or was it some separate
fatal error in logic? In "The
Knick," nothing is ever gained
easily in the pursuit of truth.
Unlike the C-section scene
from the series opener, the
failed blood transfusion
focused not on sheer
bloodcurdling shock value
but on heart-crushing defeat
in the face of death. To make
matters worse, Thackery
seeks redemption from the
rehabilitation facility, but
winds up in the exact same
place he does at the beginning
of the season: passed out on
drugs.
Herein lies the logic behind
much of "The Knick's" social
commentary. We are still
talking about the things they
did in 1900. But then again,
should that exonerate bigotry?
After all, just because we',
were doing it in 1900 doesn't
make it okay. As shown in this
week's episode, they also used
to think toothaches caused
mental disease and heroin
cured cocaine addiction. "The
Knick," and "Crutchfield"
especially, asks the question
of where our body stops and
our humanity begins, where
the individual ceases and his
or her society takes over.
Anyone who was wondering
what racism had to do with
medicine will undoubtedly
understand it's place in
the final episode with the
termination of Cornelia (Juliet
Rylance, "Sinister") and Dr.
Edward's (Andre Holland,
"42") unborn child. The final
scene of him street-fighting
juxtaposes tragically with
Cornelia's wedding, and
you realize just how much
you've come to care for these
characters in the short time
we've had with them.
A few surprises also made
their way into "The Knick"
this week. Notably, Sister
Harriet (Cara Seymour, "An
Education") revealed herself
to be personally performing
the abortion procedures. The

story of boozy ambulance
driver Tom Cleary (newcomer
Chris Sullivan) and Harriet
remains one of the series'
strong points, but until this
episode their arrangement
remained a little unclear.
Fortunately for fans, their
story seems far from over.
Another thread hanging in
the balance is Barrow (Jeremy
Bobb, "House of Cards") and
his employment of Wu (Perry
Yung, "The Carrie Diaries")
to murder loan-shark Collier
(Danny Hoch, "The Good
Wife").Butit'snotWu'sshadow
which haunts the viewer in
Barrow's storyline. Barrow got
punched in the testicles and
there was a definite "squish."
Even after the scene, Barrow
carried himself in a way that
was noticeably uncomfortable.
If this means the first surgical
castration on television, let's
be honest, "The Knick" is
likely where it'd happef.
But then again, that's
the genius of "The Knick"
and something very much
intentional. This show can be
considered just as much horror
or noir as period and medical
drama. Every scene's filled
with tension and refuses to
let go, no matter how horrific
things might be. Yet, despite
the utter dread - pervasive
through every frame, there's
the promise of greater truth
and understanding. The same
can be said about surgery and
research, and that's ultimately
what "The Knick" is: a long
overdue medical exam on
who we are as a people and
as a society. It might not be
pleasant to look at, but it also
might just save our lives. It
also helps that we've been
given some truly wonderful
characters to spend our time
with, each played in heartfelt
and affable performances by
the cast.
Season two begins
production in 2015 and it's
unclear if Soderbergh will
return, but as long as Thackery
and the rest of the circus at the
Knick are there, any viewer
will be in the very best of care.

Annie and Jake's friends are
gradually introduced to help them
solve their engagement issues,
and they, too, fit the stock roles of
sitcom characters. To add to the
show's pseudo-groundbreaking
nature, Annie also has two ador-
ably gay dads (played by Tim
Meadows, "SNL" and Dan Buca-
tinsky, "Scandal").
But there are times when
Annie's vivacity becomes cartoon-
ish, taking the drama-queen per-
sona a bit too far for reality. She
is quite reminiscent of Wilson's
Penny from "Happy Endings,"
where despite her often annoying
personal qualities, she still con-
vinces the audience to root for her
unstable relationship.
On the other hand, Jake's per-
sonality does not stand firmly on
its own, as it relies and even has
rub-offs from Annie's actions. His
one-dimensional ways may be a
challenge to progress through the
series.
The scenes, though noth-
ing original, still endearingly
showcase the fated love between
Annie and Jake - from their first
date where Annie hypocritically
accosts Jake, to the time when she
blurts "I love you" from a karaoke
stage. Jake's rational composure
certainly complements her emo-
tionally frantic qualities, which
eliminates the show's need for a
straight man since they are effort-
lessly funny together.
Going forward, "Marry Me"
doesn't needto try so hard to retain
the audience's interest, because
the simple chemistry of Wilson
and Marino can hold it up more
than the cliches they embody.

The timelessness
of theater

I,

few nights ago, to
break up an evening
spent studying for
midterms, I queued the next
episode of one of my favorite
shows to
binge watch
on Netflix,
"Mad Men."
About half- r
way through
the fifth sea-
son, there's
a scene that KATHLEEN
takes place DAVIS
with no
significant
purpose, not much character
development and lasts only
about a minute, yet it left me
thinking fordthe remainder
of the episode. The heavy
drinking, heavy smoking
Don Draper goes to a play in
New York City with his sec-
ond wife Megan: The camera
pans over the audience, men
clad in well-fitting suits,
women in beautiful dresses
and gaudy jewelry. A cigarette
smoke haze hangs through
the theater (it is the 1960s
after all). However, one
thing eerily caught my
eye as being incongruent
to the scene taking place
50-odd years ago: the play
the Drapers watch has no
set, the actors wear black
and collapse on the ground
when not speaking, mir-
rors several plays I've seen
in this modern millennium
I considered modern and
experimental. As the episode
moved on and the play is bare-
ly mentioned again, my mind
kept wandering to that scene.
"Mad Men" never makes
mistakes of bringing anachro-
nistic things to the set or sto-
ryline, which means the plays
of stripped-down nature I've
seen aren't as progressive as I
thought, but rather have been
around for quite some time.

Warner Bros. published both

The real kicker of the Nemesis
system, though, is the role of
death in the game. Death is
more meaningful in "Mordor"
than anything you've played
in the last 10 years outside of
"Dark Souls:" When Ores kill
you, they are showered with
commendations and promot-
ed within their ranks. They
become harder to kill and some-
times gain new abilities that
make them invincible to certain
damage types. It's a fun chal-
lenge, not an annoyance.

Unfortunately, apart from
the impressive detail in the ore
captains, the game doesn't look
or sound all that great. It's cer-
tainly technically impressive
on PS4, but Mordor just isn't
that interesting of a setting; it
feels barren and dull even when
the setting moves south and
becomes greener later in the

better had they instead licensed
the film soundtrack. The
voice acting is also very stan-
dard, with Troy Baker ("The
Last of Us") and Nolan North
("Uncharted: Drake's Fortune")
phoning in their least memora-
ble parts yet. These guys are so
talented, give them better roles!
Apparently the soon-to-be
released last-generation ver-
sions of this game will have a
significantly neutered version
of the Nemesis system. If that
turns out to be the case, stay
away from those versions. The
Nemesis system is the reason to
play this game.
The enjoyment you will get
from "Mordor" is completely
foreign to the spirit of the "Lord
of the Rings" series, but that
doesn't mean it lacks value.
Perhaps if it were set in its own
unique universe, it would have
scored in the "A" range. Regard-
less, it's big, dumb, violent open-
world fun, like the kind you had
with "Mercenaries," "Assas-
sin's Creed" or "Far Cry." If that
sounds up your alley, you may
want to take a walk through
"Mordor."

Gardner healthy for MSU

MEWS BASKETBALL
Fresh Five bond
remains strong

By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Editor
When Devin Gardner entered
postgame media availability
wearing a boot on his left foot
after the Michigan football
team's 18-13 victory over Penn
State last weekend, it was clear
the victory had taken a toll.
The fifth-year senior
quarterback had been
temporarily removed from
the game in the third quarter
because of the injury, but he
V fought through the pain and
had been reinserted in the
beginning of the fourth quarter.
Gardner said he thought
he'd be ready to play after
the team's bye week. With a
greater challenge against No.
8 Michigan State looming, the
timing of the injury wasn't
exactly ideal.
Iast season, the Spartans'
defense spanked Gardner and
the Wolverines' offense, sacking
the quarterback seven times.
The combination of returning
from injury and Michigan
State's potent defense could be
a daunting task, but Gardner
insisted there will be no mental
hurdle in getting ready to
play the team that delivered
punishing hits last season.
Monday, Gardner said he felt
no ill effects from the injury.
"I felt like I was pretty
healthy, could've practiced last
week, but they wanted to hold
me out, so I got a chance to get
a lot of mental reps," Gardner
said. "But I practiced yesterday
fine, and I'm right where I was
before the injury."
Michigan will need a healthy
Gardner to pull off the upset.
The Spartans have the ninth-
best defense in the country,
surrendering an average of
292.7 yards per game.

TERESA MATHEW/Daily
Fifth-year senior quarterback Devin Gardner wasn't ina boot Monday, and the coaches said he's "full-go" in practice.

Though there are multiple
personnel changes in Michigan
State's defense from last season,
memories of the Spartans'
dominance a. year ago are still
fresh. The Wolverines rushed for
minus-48 yards in that contest.
"Last year was last year,"
said redshirt junior offensive
lineman Jack Miller. "And that
was a great Michigan State
defense.This year,itlooks alittle
different, the guys that they
have, but it's the same type of
thing, the same type of scheme
and a lot of great players on the
defensive side of the ball."
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
understands the challenge
facing his offense that has
struggled at numerous points

this season. Gardner has
thrown eight interceptions,
but Hoke said preventing
mistakes against the Spartans
goes beyond the quarterback
position.
"I think we all need to play
our best football, whether it be
Devin or anyone else," Hoke
said. "We talked about the
negative rushing yards a year
ago; that's not just on Devin.
When a guy gets sacked and all
that kind of stuff, you're turning
some people loose and some of
it is also he's got to get rid of the
ball. There's a rhythm to it."
The two teams enter the
beginning of the rivalry week
in vastly different positions.
The Wolverines are fighting

for a possible bowl game berth,
while Michigan State has
been mentioned as a possible
contender for a spot in the
College Football Playoff.
Michigan won't change its
mantra of focusing on itself
rather than worrying about
the opponent. Gardner stated
multiple times Monday that
every loss hurts him equally,
rivalry or not.
This week, he chooses to
focus on the positive effects
a win could have on his team,
rather than the damage it would
inflict on the aspirations of the
Spartans.
"It's not about us ruining
their season. It's about us,"
Gardner said.

When facing off against No.
7 UMass Lowell and No. 12
Boston University in its trip to
Boston this weekend, the No.
14 Michigan hockey team will
need all hands on deck if it
wants to walk away with wins.
Monday's practice provided
some
optimism, NOTEBOOK
as freshman
forward Tony Calderone
returned to the ice after
rehabbing a groin injury for the
past few weeks, putting himself
in prime position to make his
collegiate debut Friday.
"He likely could've played
last weekend," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson. "We
wanted to be sure and give him
a little more time on the ice, so
he should be good to go now. If
M; he can get through the week of
practice, he's got a good shot at
playing this weekend."
Swapping places with
Calderone on the bench
for the time being is senior
forward Andrew Sinelli. After
suffering a hit from behind that
resulted in the ejection of New
Hampshire's Dylan Maller on
Saturday night, Sinelli is day-
to-day with pain in his shoulder
and groin, but he isn't expected
to be out for long.
"Groins are hard, because
in hockey, you can't go out
and skate with a hurt groin,"
Berenson said. "You have to stay
off the ice and ride the bike or
some other things, but skating's
the worst thing you can do with
a hurt groin, and Sinelli's had
a little bit of a history, so we're
going to take it slow."
