Creating social change and 

gaining entrepreneurial success 
as a woman were among the 
emphasized topics discussed 
by female business leaders at 
the Women, Entrepreneurship 
and Social Change Conference 
Wednesday afternoon. 

Fostering conference, held 

in the Michigan League, was 
organized by LSA senior Hayley 
Maybaum. Maybaum met Sonya 
Passi, the founder and CEO of 
FreeFrom, while doing pro bono 
work at a law firm in New York 
City during a summer internship, 
and the pair collaborated with 
the Center for Entrepreneurship 

to 
connect 
social 
justice 

with 
entrepreneurship 
at 

the 
University 
through 
the 

conference.

After the initial networking 

breakfast, 
Passi 
began 

the speaker portion of the 
conference. 
Passi 
is 
based 

in Los Angeles, where she 
runs 
FreeFrom, 
a 
national 

organization 
dedicated 
to 

providing economic justice and 
entrepreneurial empowerment 
to 
survivors 
of 
domestic 

violence. 
The 
goal 
of 
her 

organization’s efforts is to help 
survivors 
achieve 
financial 

stability on their own.

Author and journalist Kate 

Andersen 
Brower 
detailed 

the experiences of those who 
often work behind the scenes 
at the White House, ensuring 
everything functions smoothly 
while serving the first family, 
while discussing her new book, 
“The Residence: Inside the 
Private World of the White 
House,” Wednesday night.

Brower said staffers who 

often work with first families 
for up to 30 or 40 years, develop 
close relationships with them.

“I came up for the idea for 

‘The Residence’ when I was a 
reporter at Bloomberg News 
and I had lunch with Michelle 
Obama and about a dozen 
other White House reporters,” 
Brower said. “And at this lunch, 
a butler came in and out of the 
room … and Mrs. Obama called 
him by his first name and it 
made me wonder who are these 
people who, none of us, as 
reporters, ever got to actually 
see.”

Brower said the stories she 

shared from the book were 
largely 
unknown 
until 
she 

began talking to White House 
staffers. Ann Arbor resident 
Frank Tinnie was surprised by 
many of the stories that Brower 
shared, since he didn’t know 
many of them.

“The fact that the staff has 

been there for so long, and 
generations of families have 

worked there, I thought that 
was interesting,” Tinnie said. 
“And the idea that the first 
ladies still stay in contact.”

As the event was held in the 

Gerald R. Ford Presidential 
Library, Brower fittingly told 
many stories about Gerald and 
Betty Ford, and added that 
Betty Ford is her favorite first 
lady.

“(Dick 
Cheney) 
fondly 

remembers 
approaching 

President 
Ford 
along 
with 

Donald Rumsfeld, and going 
into the Oval Office — this 
was during the presidential 
campaign — and just very 
meekly suggesting that someone 
tell Betty Ford to stop being so 
vocal about her support for the 
Equal 
Rights 
Amendment,” 

Brower said. “And President 
Ford just looked at him and 
said, ‘Boys, you know where her 
office is in the East Wing; you go 

tell her yourself.’ ”

The 
departure 
of 
each 

president is often an emotional 
one after four or eight years 
spent with staffers. Whether it’s 
eating with staffers or having 
tea with them, Brower said the 
first families get to know the 
people who work for them.

LSA seniors David Scahfer and 

Micah Griggs’ administration 
came to an official end last week 
as eMerge’s candidates LSA 
junior Anusha Sarkar and Public 
Policy junior Nadine Jawad 
weresworn in. The second half 
of the Schafer term furthered 
the ground work from Fall, now 
acting on their resolutions and 
plans made promised.

Diversity
A 
resolution 
was 

unanimously passed to support 
the recognition of Indigenous 
Peoples’ Day. With Washtenaw 
County and Ann Arbor already 
celebrating the holiday, the 
resolution aimed to be a gesture 
toward indigenous and Native 
American tribes that are still 
active in the state.

One of the authors, LSA senior 

Kaitlin Gant, said it was vital 
for the University to support its 
students.

Union of more than 2,000 graduate students leverages action against administration

The 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization 
— 
the 
union 

representing more than 2,000 
graduate student instructors and 
graduate student staff assistants at 
the University of Michigan — will 

be voting Thursday to authorize 
a strike ballot among GSIs and 
GSSAs. The vote comes after the 
final contract bargaining session 
with the University’s human 
resources department Wednesday 
evening ended unresolved.

At the heart of the contentious 

negotiation process, which began 
in 
November, 
are 
aggressive 

bargaining practices on the part 
of the University administration, 
and GEO’s ambitious platform 
of increased benefits and wages. 
The bargaining has taken on 
heightened 
significance 
in 

Michigan’s 
precarious 
labor 

environment, as this is the first 
contract GEO has negotiated 
under right-to-work laws. GEO 

president John Ware, a Rackham 
student, said Wednesday night’s 
session came “down to the wire.” 

“It was the most productive 

session in a long time, and we got 
a lot done,” he said.

In an email sent to students, 

faculty and staff in the school, 

Dworkin announced that he 

has mixed emotions about his 

resignation.

“It is necessary for me to have 

the opportunity to focus more on 

my family, and this step reflects a 

joint family decision on our part,” 

he wrote in the announcement. “I 

appreciate your understanding about 

this, and my need for privacy on this 

matter.”

Dworkin was the first African-

American man to lead the program, 

and he was approved by the Board 

of Regents for the position in March 

of 2015.

In his resignation 

announcement, Dworkin stated 

he will work as a faculty member 

teaching creative entrepreneurship 

and arts leadership courses in the 

fall. He will also help with the 

transition for the interim dean.

“I look forward to supporting the 

interim dean, as well as furthering 

the field of creative entrepreneurship 

and arts leadership for the broader 

university community,” he wrote.

The interim provost, Paul 

Courant, is set to recommend 

an interim dean in the coming 

months, and he will lead a national 

search to appoint the next dean. 

The University Record reported 

that Courant reached out to Music, 

Theatre & Dance faculty and staff 

to ask for recommendations for 

potential search advisory committee 

members.

In the announcement, 

Dworkin highlighted some of 

the Music, Theatre & Dance 

School’s accomplishments that he 

witnessed while he was part of the 

staff, including the creation of the 

Department of Chamber Music, 

and the increase in community 

engagement activities for the school, 

to name a few.

“I am honored to have been part 

of the tremendous evolution of our 

school over these past two years, 

which has been extraordinarily 

exciting, and has included so many 

successes on the part of so many 

students, faculty, and staff,” he wrote.

Dworkin has spent some time 

at the University of Michigan, as he 

obtained a bachelor’s degree and 

master of fine arts degree in violin 

performance from the University.

“From my time as a student 

once upon a time to my role as dean, 

the School of Music, Theatre & 

Dance—which means the people 

who comprise our school— has 

transformed my life, as I know it has 

for so many of you,” he wrote.

RE LIGION AND SCIE NCE

After seven years of planning 

and design, the University of 
Michigan Nuclear Engineering 
Laboratory 
building 
reopened 

Monday afternoon, complete with 
more space and renovations in its 
laboratories, offices, conference 
rooms and collaboration rooms for 
students.

Previously, the building housed 

the decommissioned Ford Nuclear 
Reactor, which shut down in the 
early 2000s.

Electrical 
Engineering 
Prof. 

David Munson, Jr., a former dean of 
engineering, said he was involved 
in 
the 
building’s 
historically 

relevant renovations.

“It was constructed sometime 

after World War II and there 
was a research effort that was 
launched in the University that was 
really done as a memorial to the 

University alums who were killed 
in World War II,” he said. “The 
goal of this research was to pioneer 
peaceful uses of atomic energy.”

Munson 
said 
despite 
the 

building’s nuclear reactor shutting 
down more than a decade ago, it took 
many years for federal regulators 
to approve new construction and 
renovation because of the need to 
clean and ensure the safety of the 
space. The building is now home to 
a variety of features and laboratory 
space aimed at advancing nuclear 
security, 
safety, 
energy 
and 

nonproliferation, the prevention of 
the spread nuclear weaponry.

Sara Pozzi, a nuclear engineering 

and radiological sciences professor, 
is one of the researchers using 
the new facilities to detect and 
characterize 
nuclear 
material 

in a popular new field in nuclear 
engineering. Pozzi mentioned one 
of the cornerstones of the nuclear 
engineering labs included the 
linear accelerator, a medical device 

that came from the Department of 
Homeland Security. 

“We’ll be able to host a linear 

accelerator, which is a machine 
that accelerates electrons,” she 
said. “It’s a medical machine so it’s 
actually used for cancer treatment 
but it’s being donated to us by the 
Department of Homeland Security, 
whom we work for.”

Pozzi said the linear accelerator 

will be especially helpful in 
detecting 
nuclear 
material 
in 

containers. She said this is critical 
in advancing nuclear security.

“In 
these 
applications, 
we 

are 
looking 
for 
Uranium 
or 

Uranium-235 
inside 
hidden 

containers,” Pozzi said. “So imagine 
someone were to try to smuggle in 
some Uranium for a weapon and 
you want to find it inside a shielded 
container. To do that you would 
have to interrogate the container 
with a beam of particle from a high-
energy X-ray that would come from 
the linear accelerator.”

Other 
world-class 
lab 

equipment has been added to 
the building, including imaging 
tools and gamma ray detectors, 
which Pozzi described as critical 
to characterizing radiation.

“These can detect not only the 

presence of gamma rays but also 
tell you where they’re coming 
from so they can characterize 
a whole field of radiation and 
where it comes from,” she said.

For the students who will be 

doing research in the nuclear 
engineering lab, Pozzi said 
collaboration rooms, generous 
lab 
space 
and 
advanced 

lab 
equipment 
promise 
a 

more 
intellectual 
working 

environment. These facilities, 
she explained, will positively 
affect 
students 
who 
are 

investigating topics in nuclear 
engineering and writing their 
theses.

“A lot of students will be 

affected by this lab,” she said. 
“Student doing on their thesis 
work will be able to do some 
great experiments because of 
the new space.”

I’m not proud to make this 

declaration by any means; I’m 
actually quite devastated that this 
has become a facet of my being, 
but holy fuck do I detest reading. 
I’m not talking about the day-
to-day casual Reddit browsing, 
Facebook lurking stuff, or the 
kind that is fundamental. I’m 
talking like the big-ass textbooks, 
fucking “War and Peace” type of 
reading expected of me from a 
bunch of classes I’ve taken. Every 
Facebook meme ever created that 
pokes fun at not doing the reading 
can have my name found tagged 
somewhere in the comments 
section. And before you say 
anything, yes, I see the irony in 
me writing this for people to read 
while simultaneously dispelling 
my unfavorable feelings toward 
the practice. The title says it all, 
but bear with me.

I have this inclination to test 

the patience of authority; I love 
erring on the side of mischief. 
I’m honestly a little shit, and this 
display of little shittiness can best 
be shown through my inability to 
tell you about the plot of a single 
novel the average high schooler 
should have read in any of their 
English classes. I mean, I didn’t 
even check out the last book I 
was required to read for my AP 
Lit class senior year, like I was 
that done with reading by then. 
Jay Gatsby? I don’t know her. 
Hamlet? Couldn’t say that I am 
familiar with that queen. Mrs. 
Dalloway? Which school did she 
teach at? Because I can’t say I’ve 
ever met her. I’m not even telling 
you all of this to, like, brag, either 
— like, it’s actually something 
real embarrassing and shameful 
to admit, but this primer on my 
propensity toward not reading 
becomes relevant soon, I swear.

Reading is hard. Reading is 

really fucking hard and I relished 
in the glory of my simple acts of 
disobedience by just … not doing 
it. My attention span is essentially 
the 
Planck-length 
equivalent 

of time, which could perhaps 
explain my habit of becoming 
engrossed in the lives and times 
of the authors of books I should’ve 
been reading instead of reading 
the actual books themselves. I 
mean, I told you it’s not that I 
hate literature or anything. It 
most likely was because I couldn’t 
be bothered to read anything 
expected of me out of both 
laziness and adolescent mischief. 
This habit would manifest itself 
throughout various classes, in 
different forms, but nonetheless 
with the same result. Physics 
lessons on Einstein’s theories 
of relativity led me to instead 
learn about his hobbies as an 
amateur violinist while calculus 
lectures on Newton’s creation 
of an entirely new branch of 
mathematics led me to follow this 
tangent about his religious fervor 
and penchant for being weird as 
hell.

Toward the end of middle 

school, I had to learn this 
Tchaikovsky 
piece 
for 
a 

symphony 
audition. 
It 
was 

his 
“Serenade 
for 
Strings,” 

the 48th opus, which was this 
orchestral masterpiece written 
in the absolute most horrific time 
signature ever. The technical 
demands of the piece alongside 

the massive Romantic-era middle 
finger that was the time signature 
drove me to, of course, not read 
through the piece at all. I want 
to make a brief mention that my 
habit of disregarding readings 
did not simply end at the written 
text; rather, it indiscriminately 
dismantled any drive I would 
have to begin reading anything 
that was required of me, and 
that included this daunting six-
page shitstorm of a serenade. 
During the free periods I should 
have 
spent 
rehearsing 
the 

serenade’s dreaded triple piano 
“pianississimo” 
measures, 
I 

instead, surprisingly, read this 
book about the composer himself. 
It was in “The Life and Letters 
of Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky” that 
I read this quote from him that 
would resonate with me well into 
the current day. Tchaikovsky 
described himself as “Russian 
in the fullest sense of the word,” 
to 
which 
I 
thought: 
“How 

incredible. Not just a veritable 
sense, but the fullest sense. How 
affirming it must be to be able 
to fully identify with a culture.” 
I think the reason as to why his 
words connected with me to such 
an extent is because they made 
me aware of this hollow cavity 
inside me that housed my cultural 
identity. It led to the realization 
that I couldn’t truly say that I 
fully identify as anything.

I was born on the first of 

November in Can Tho, a large port 
village that skims the Mekong 
Delta along the southern fringes 
of Vietnam. I couldn’t really tell 
you anything about what life was 
like there besides the fact that 
it’s just really fucking hot. I was 
really young when I left Vietnam 
with my parents to pursue the 
prospect of a better life here in 
the States. The first four years 
of my life I recall entirely in 
Vietnamese. My clearest memory 
from this time in my life was a 
very specific moment where my 
mother was sitting at the kitchen 
table eating. I asked her why she 
made so much noise while she ate, 
to which she laughed and asked 
me if I would like to eat with 
her. I sat there with her and we 
just had this casual and carefree 
conversation in the kitchen. I 
don’t know why this one specific 
memory is so clearly branded 
frame for frame in my mind, but 
it, like other memories of my early 
childhood, was narrated back to 
me entirely in my mother tongue. 
I think the closest I’ve ever felt to 
Tchaikovsky’s cultural “fullness” 
was at this point in my life.

I started school at 4 years old. 

I never realized that the children 
in my class had the privilege 
of growing up in homes where 
English was regularly spoken. 
I remember crying so hard on 
the first day of preschool that 
I fucking puked a storm on my 
teacher. It was such a mess; there 
were all of these people around 
me mouthing these weird sounds 
and reacting with confusion when 
I couldn’t understand them and 
then the puke being everywhere 
— like it really was just not cute. 
I didn’t pick up English as quickly 
as my teachers would have liked 
during early elementary school. I 
swear to God I was about a hair 
away from repeating the first 
grade because of my inability to 
properly speak the language or 
make any progress in those little 
English workbooks where you 

fill in a letter to make words and 
phrases. In the end, I couldn’t 
tell you what made it all click, 
but I would eventually pick up 
English incredibly fast. Like, 
scary fast; scary like the reading 
teachers had to constantly tell me 
to slow down with my reading, 
essentially putting a harness 
on my reading skills so that the 
other kids could “catch up.” This 
was pretty much how the rest of 
my schooling went with regard to 
English. I honestly did pretty well 
in my English classes. Like I’m not 
even trying to gas myself up here 
or anything, but my essays were 
usually pretty fucking lit despite 
my never doing the required 
readings for any of those classes. I 
don’t even know, like I went from 
this scared and confused child 
who couldn’t understand what 
anyone around him was saying to 
someone who would be asked to 
proofread college and scholarship 
essays for friends. English was no 
longer a burden on me. I learned 
to use it well enough that I began 
to identify as somebody who 
had a pretty lit command of the 
language, but this achievement 
came at a cost. What I hadn’t 
noticed was that during the years 
I spent developing my English, 
my ability to speak Vietnamese 
suffered. I began to realize that I 
couldn’t speak Vietnamese like I 
used to. I would stutter, mumble 
and replace various words with 
their English equivalent. As 
much as I tried to communicate 
with my parents, the words just 
couldn’t come out with the clarity 
and eloquence I was so familiar 
with when speaking English. I 
knew that I knew these words. 
Spoken to me, I’d understand 
almost every Vietnamese word 
my parents would speak, but as 
I sorted through the linguistic 
rolodex in my brain to try to hunt 
for the right string of words or 
phrases to respond back to them, 
nothing came out. I don’t really 
know how to describe it. It’s like 
getting into a really fucked up 
accident and having to learn how 
to walk again. Like you knew that 
at some point in the past you could 
do it, and that you did it pretty 
well, but here you are, trying to 
pick up these pieces of your past 
so that you can put together at 
least a semblance of who you once 
were. With language having had 
such a profound impact on me, I 
couldn’t come to terms with the 
fact that I more or less lost my 
ability to proudly communicate 
in my mother tongue. I was even 
having trouble calling it that. 
Like aren’t you supposed to know 
your mother tongue better than 
anything else? By technicality 
English is my second language, so 
I just felt so distraught realizing 
that my ability to speak it had so 
greatly surpassed the language 
I was basically born speaking. 
In a way it felt like language, 
something I had learned to 
confide in for so long and 
something that helped me form 
my identity, betrayed me in some 
type of way? I can’t really think 
of another word for it. Honestly, I 
was just about 50 shades of shook 
over the whole situation if you 
really want to know the truth.

This whole story brings me 

back to what I was talking about 
earlier, the whole discussion 
on “fullness.” I guess a kind 
of end goal for me in terms of 
culture and identity would be to 

connect to something remotely 
similar to Tchaikovsky’s cultural 
“fullness,” and I don’t mean end 
goal like it’s something I want 
to do before I die or anything. 
I just mean it in the sense like, 
“Damn, wouldn’t it be really 
fucking incredible to feel the 
way Tchaikovsky felt about his 
own identity?” I think why this 
whole ordeal hit me so hard is 
because I feel like language is one 
of the most important facets of a 
culture. Like, beyond anything 
else, language connects you with 
others in such a personal way, so 
I kept asking myself, like, if I can’t 
speak the language of a particular 
culture, can I even fully identify 
with it? I’m just very preoccupied 
with the word “fully,” but how, 
like, many things can I even fully 
identify as? It just brings up a shit 
ton of questions, like, “Can I fully 
identify as a given ethnicity if I 
wasn’t born in a certain place?” 
or “Can I fully be an ethnicity 
if I don’t necessarily look like 
a person who belongs to it?” 
Perhaps such an inability to fully 
identify as anything nowadays is 
something symptomatic of the 
modern age. Like, it could just 
be something that accompanies 
the 
common 
practice 
of 

compartmentalizing 
every 

aspect of our being into these 
new and labeled divisions. Maybe 
in some ways this Tchaikovskic 
fullness isn’t realistic. Like, I 
could just one day come to the 
realization that I will never be 
able to, in any manner, replicate 
even the modicum of the fullness 
Tchaikovsky wrote about, but 
even if that were the case, I 
don’t think there are any real 
detriments toward the pursuit of 
such a feeling. Some might call 
it myopic, like somehow having 
this focus on a singular aspect of 
culture in the hopes of attaining 
some abstract fulfillment isn’t 
sensible. I mean, I can definitely 
see how people would believe 
that, seeing it as being vapid and 
shallow, but I think we have to 
keep in mind that we all currently 
live in this era where we ourselves 
have the ability, now more than 
ever, to form our own identities. 
We can choose to append or 
remove certain facets and aspects 
of ourselves to grow closer to our 
ideal self, and I think that’s a very 
freeing aspect of it all, despite 
claims that it can be seen as being 
inauthentic or full of shit. I guess 
the hyper-idealized millennial 
sense of self is the result of a 
fluid amalgamation of various 
different things. Maybe this 
fluidity is a completely different 
sense of self than Tchaikovsky’s 
original 
interpretation 
of 

fullness, or perhaps the result 
of this amalgamation is exactly 
how he may have felt. I mean, as 
much as I’d like to, I can’t really 
slide into his DMs to ask him how 
he personally defines fullness, so 
I guess a lot of it is up in the air. 
The fact of the matter is, I’m still 
trying to figure out my own sense 
of self and how it relates in the 
context of the world around me. 
And maybe I won’t ever be able to 
say that I am Vietnamese in the 
fullest sense of the word and feel 
the satisfaction Tchaikovsky felt. 
I guess I can be fine with that and 
just do my best to work toward a 
sense of fullness and fulfillment 
that reflects what it means to be 
fully myself, whatever the hell 
that may even mean.

Dear friend,
Today I cried in public for the 

first time in a long time. I cried in 
reaction to a performance by the 
CRLT Players from the Center 
for Research on Learning and 
Teaching. I was not supposed to 
be there since they only perform 
for graduate students, faculty and 
staff. However, my participation 
in 
the 
English 
Department’s 

Diversity 
Committee 
got 
me 

the invite so there I was. I sat 
next to Theresa Braunschneider, 
not 
knowing 
she 
was 
the 

associate director of CRLT and 
the 
coordinator 
of 
Diversity 

Initiatives Dramaturg for the 
CRLT Players. I was grateful to be 
able to discuss the performance 
and work through my emotions 
with Theresa of all people. Even 
so, I could not hold back my tears.

I cried as I watched Mariam, 

a fictional character from “A 
Thousand Cuts,” represent my 
Muslim identity and its depth on 
stage. I watched as other fictional 
characters who were supposed 
to be her friends and peers make 
assumptions of her, portray their 
stereotypes onto her, dismiss her 
and call her out for not being a 
“real Muslim” because she did not 
wear a hijab or fit their stereotypes 
of what it means to be Muslim or 
what Islam looks like. I watched 
as other fictional characters idly 
sat back and witnessed Mariam be 
labeled, attacked and excluded by 
the community. They told her not 
to worry about the election and 
that nothing could really happen 
because of checks and balances.

Yet here we are.
I, too, was repeatedly told how 

to feel, be and handle my identity. 
After watching how Mariam was 
treated, I couldn’t help but to think 
of you, my friend. You represent 
every person who has ever claimed 
to not be racist because of their one 
ethnic friend. You represent every 
person who will hold up a poster 
that claims their solidarity to take 

a picture for the news or post it 
on social media but truly does 
not care about minority issues. 
Most importantly, you represent 
the people who claim to respect 
my identities and yet support the 
policies that attack my identities.

How dare you.
How dare you claim to respect 

how I feel and say you stand in 
solidarity with me yet support my 
attacker and feel nothing for how 
my identity is being attacked.

However, this is not about 

you or your fake support. This 
is about how we claim “all men 
were created equal” and “thou 
shalt love thy neighbor,” yet that 
truly only applies to the dominant, 
white, 
Christian 
men 
and, 

sometimes, women. I have had 
enough of the fake pretenses. The 
very government that is supposed 
to protect me sees me as a threat. 
What am I to do? I’ll tell you what I 
am not going to do.

I will not allow you to pretend 

to be my ally.

I will not allow you to fill me 

with dismay or make me feel like 
I am in the wrong for being upset.

I will not idly sit back while you 

disrespect me.

I will call you out and remove 

you from my life. I will forever 
stand up for what I believe in.

And you “those who stand for 

nothing fall for anything.”

So don’t you dare.
Don’t you dare tell me I’m 

overacting.

Don’t you dare tell me to respect 

policies that reinforce the stigma I 
have faced my entire life.

And don’t you dare tell me it’s 

going to be OK because it’s already 
not OK.

It has never been OK.
Still I feel sorry for you. I am 

sorry you can’t see past your naïve, 
prejudice-based fears and break 
through the stereotypes society 
has fed you. And I am mad. I am 
mad because I truly cared about 
you. But this is not about you. This 
is about how I feel and you have no 
right to devalue my feelings.

So this is goodbye.
And I am not sorry.

Vietnamese and Tchaikovsky: 
Finding fullness in one’s culture

T

here is nothing like a 
fall afternoon at the Big 
House. A football game, 

a great band, discerning fans 
and lots of excitement. About 
110,168 fans on a regular basis, not 
counting the vast TV audiences, 
couldn’t be wrong.

But there is another storyline 

here. College football has become 
much bigger than the universities 
it actually purports to represent. 
Michigan football is branded on 
the sweats and tees and mugs of 
every Wal-Mart in the country. 
People recognize “Hail to the 
Victors” when they hear it, and 
if they watch national sports, 
they’ll recognize the distinctive 
helmets. Michigan alumni clubs 
propose “game-watching” events 
in a sports bar setting as their 
major activity. Young recruits 
squint as spotlights feature their 
signing day on national broadcasts. 
And most notably, the Michigan 
coach has become what is needed 
today to get your brand out 
there in cyberspace — headline-
making notoriety with nation-
wide football camps and tweets 
that bring attention to his star 
status. He is remunerated seven 
times more than his ostensible 
supervisor, the president of the 
University of Michigan. 

No one should be naive. Making 

money is what makes major 
college football today. As media 
look for more events to broadcast 
and pushes colleges to grasp the 
golden ring, money becomes ever 
more important. Go to a game 
and you will see it all — replete 
with long, scheduled delays on 
the field so that TV can get in 
ads. Tickets are legally scalped 
online while the little guy trying 
to make $20 on State Street is 
prohibited from doing so. Food 

sales are huge because you can’t 
bring your own popcorn in with 
you. The band, likely for the media, 
is now amplified — that is to say, 
our band, not the visiting team’s. 
It is only a matter of time before 
the University permits more overt 
advertising on scoreboards and 
even in the naming of the stadium. 
How about the Ajax Widget 
Michigan Stadium?

This is our free-market system, 

but whether many universities can 
perpetuate this business model 
in the future is anyone’s guess. 
Let’s make some changes so that 
football can flourish.

First, since college football 

is big-time entertainment, pay 
the actors. Though he expresses 
his gratitude for his education 
and opportunities, as Jake Butt 
said in a press interview at the 
end of March, his scholarship is 
hardly enough to cover his rent, 
let alone any other expenses. And 
only a small elite later translate 
their athletic prowess into a 
paycheck at the professional 
level. Some of us might be 
surprised at how much these 
young people sacrifice, including 
their 
university 
education, 

because their focus on a long 
season, and not on their studies, 
makes academic achievement an 
unattainable goal. When you see 
the heroic plays they make and 
the injuries they sustain, they 
need recompense. It would be the 
honorable thing to do.

If players wished to matriculate 

at the University, they could 
compete on an equal basis with 
the kids who populate the student 
section at the games. And by the 
way, a few years ago it was the 
students, not anyone else, who 
protested when an obviously 
injured player was not immediately 

pulled out of the game, and when 
the cost of their attending a game 
reached new heights. All that 
for someone else’s pocket, to the 
exclusion of students and players.

Second, create the Michigan 

Football Corporation. That could 
readily accept funds from alumni, 
unabashedly sell its brand and 
raise the money needed to keep 
it all going. A corporation, most 
simply, could be located in Ann 
Arbor and lease and maintain the 
stadium and its blandishments. 
The corporation could apply its 
rents and royalties to bringing 
more 
deserving 
cash-short 

students t =o the University 
campus. The team could serve 
as a farm team, as in baseball, or 
in European soccer, training and 
selecting the next generation of 
stars for the big time.

Such a model would avoid the 

unnecessary conflicts inherent 
in marrying a huge business to 
a university. It would eliminate 
the seeming contradictions of 
educating young people versus 
running a quality business. It 
would insulate the University 
from the vagaries of the sports 
market, 
which 
increasingly 

relies on huge budgets. If you’ve 
been to a bowl game or a regular 
season match at a number of 
our less football-focused sister 
universities, you’ll note that the 
market for watching games is 
nearing its saturation point.

The University of Michigan is 

a great university and its maize-
and-blue Wolverines are world 
famous. Let’s provide them the 
space to grow.

Transgender rights are a 

nationwide issue, as human 
dignity should not be based on 
where a person happens to live. 
Redacting these guidelines 
put in place by the Obama 
administration affects people 
regardless 
of 
geographic 

location. Despite the promises 
of President Trump and Betsy 
DeVos to protect the LGBTQ 
community, 
rescinding 
the 

“Dear Colleague” letter makes 
clear 
the 
administration’s 

disregard for the rights of 
the 
LGBTQ 
community. 

Furthermore, 
this 
action 

once 
again 
perpetuates 

false 
and 
harmful 
notions 

that 
transgender 
people 

are 
predators. 
The 
daily 

experiences of discrimination 
faced by transgender people, 
including — but definitely not 
limited to — access to public 
restrooms, are difficult enough 
without a government that fails 
to validate their humanity.

Given 
that 
the 
federal 

government is rolling back 
on Obama-era policies, states 
must take action. States must 
create legislation that works 
especially to protect the rights 
of K-12 students and people 
in the workforce, who will 
likely feel the brunt of gender 
discrimination 
more 
than 

students on (usually more 
liberal) 
college 
campuses. 

Michigan currently does not 
have statewide laws, housing 
policies, employment policies 
or anti-bullying protections 
in schools with children of 
all grade levels that explicitly 
prevent 
discrimination 

based on sexual orientation 
or 
gender 
identity. 

Additionally, Michigan has 
no 
laws 
facilitating 
legal 

gender 
change 
on 
official 

identification 
documents. 

In contrast, states such as 
California 
and 
Minnesota 

support and uphold these 
policies and more. Michigan 
state government needs to 
do more to stand up for the 
civil rights of transgender 
people to show fundamental 
compassion and dignity.

Nonetheless, 
as 
federal 

policies 
continue 
to 
cut 

down on previous progress 
toward 
equality 
for 
all 

people, and Michigan state 
policies are severely lacking 
in protections, universities 
across 
the 
country 
are 

gradually 
making 
strides 

to foster a more inclusive 
community. The University 
must 
continue 
to 
make 

strides 
along 
with 
them. 

In the United States, there 
are 1,036 universities with 
nondiscrimination 
policies 

that include gender identity 
and 
expression. 
Moreover, 

there are 212 colleges and 
universities, 
including 
the 

University of Michigan, that 
have gender-inclusive housing 
for 
people 
of 
all 
gender 

identities 
and 
expressions. 

Granted, East Quad Residence 
Hall 
is 
the 
only 
official 

on-campus 
gender-inclusive 

dorm 
at 
the 
University. 

Additionally, 
there 
are 

very 
few 
gender-inclusive 

bathrooms 
on 
campus. 

Therefore, 
the 
University 

must continue to work toward 
ensuring equal access to all 
spaces on campus regardless 
of gender identity. However, 
it is great to see that the 
University is taking important 
steps many other universities 
in the United States have not. 

Though we recognize that 
this is not a perfect solution, 
and there are certainly ways 
to 
improve 
and 
increase 

resources 
for 
transgender 

students, these are important 
steps in the right direction.

These are not the only 

two cases that show the 
University’s initiative for a 
more inclusive community. 
Recently, 
the 
University 

began to allow students to 
indicate 
their 
preferred 

pronouns on course rosters 
so faculty and staff know how 
students identify regardless 
of the sex on their application. 
This 
made 
the 
University 

one of seven colleges and 
universities in the United 
States that does this. While it 
is important to acknowledge 
more must be done to improve 
the campus culture and create 
lasting, 
effective 
policies, 

we commend the University 
for 
taking 
crucial 
strides 

such as these to make the 
environment inclusive for all 
students. We ask it continues 
to take steps to better protect 
the rights of all students.

While 
the 
Trump 

administration 
may 
have 

backtracked 
on 
rights 
for 

transgender 
people 
by 

reversing the guidance from 
“Dear 
Colleague” 
of 
the 

Obama 
administration, 
it 

should not dictate how we 
handle this issue, either at 
the University level or at 
the state level. Transgender 
rights should be a topic of 
federal concern, but given 
today’s climate, it is the job 
of the state and local actors 
such as the University to 
make protecting these rights 
a priority.

T

he nomination of Judge 
Neil 
Gorsuch 
to 
the 

Supreme 
Court 
has 

displayed how partisan politics 
influence 
political 

strategies. 
Senate 

Democrats 
have 

promised to obstruct 
Gorsuch, who most 
likely will not reach 
the 60-vote margin 
needed to overcome 
a 
filibuster. 
That 

strategy has forced 
Senate Republicans 
to 
threaten 
the 

nuclear 
option, 

amending long-standing Senate 
rules 
requiring 
a 
60-vote 

supermajority to a 51-vote simple 
majority 
when 
appointing 

Supreme Court nominees.

Will 
Senate 
Democrats 

succeed 
in 
filibustering 
the 

confirmation of President Donald 
Trump’s Supreme Court justice 
nominee, Neil Gorsuch? Will the 
Republicans change the rules 
and invoke the nuclear option? It 
turns out that how the Democrats 
feel about these two options 
depends on who is in power and 
who stands to be disadvantaged 
by the decisions.

On “Meet the Press” this past 

weekend, 
outspoken 
Senate 

Minority Leader Chuck Schumer 
(D–N.Y.) argued that President 
Trump should gather with Senate 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 

to “try to come up with a 
mainstream nominee.” Schumer 
asserted that the rules should 
not be changed by Republicans 
in order to obtain cloture (the 
limitation of legislative debate by 
calling for a vote). Furthermore, 
he is critical of invocation of the 
so-called nuclear option.

It appears, however, as if 

Schumer has a very short memory 
regarding “rule changes.” His 
former colleague, then-Senate 
Majority Leader Harry Reid 
(D–Nev.), invoked the nuclear 
option in 2013 — so it would take 
only a bare majority of senators 
to confirm all nominees except 
Supreme Court picks. Angered 
by Reid’s partisan and damaging 
ploy, the Republicans warned that 
the Democrats would potentially 
suffer the consequences of the 
rules change were the Senate 
majority ever to flip.

Well, that day has arrived.
As a New York state resident 

and politically curious citizen, I 
would greatly benefit from Mr. 
Schumer 
explaining 
exactly 

what the qualifications are for a 
“mainstream nominee.” Anyone 
who took the time to carefully 

watch the confirmation hearings, 
listen to Gorsuch’s responses and 
appreciate his perspective about 
the role of the judiciary would 

have learned that he 
believes that judges do 
not make laws or policy. 
Equally as important, 
he understands that 
judges do not factor 
their personal opinions 
or beliefs into their 
decisions. Rather, they 
uphold precedent and 
follow the law.

A profound respect 

and 
admiration 
for 

impartiality 
sounds 
pretty 

mainstream to me. In fact, when 
politics are taken out of the 
discussion, I believe Gorsuch’s 
qualifications, 
record 
and 

reputation are beyond reproach. 
However, those trying to make 
logical sense of this objection are 
operating under the assumption 
that Schumer is actually open 
to consensus-building. The sad 
reality is that he is not.

Recall 
that 
in 
January, 

Schumer told MSNBC’s Rachel 
Maddow that it was difficult for 
him to imagine any “nominee 
that 
Donald 
Trump 
would 

choose that would get Republican 
support that we could support.” 
His promise to do his best at 
keeping the seat vacant for the 
entirety of Trump’s presidency 
is not only hypocritical but also 
undemocratic.

Let’s not be hoodwinked by 

Schumer — a senator whose 
obstructionism 
is 
no 
more 

than a reaction to a lingering 
aftertaste of Mitch McConnell 
refusing to consider Obama’s 
nomination of Merrick Garland 
after Antonin Scalia’s passing. 
On “Meet the Press,” McConnell 
referred to the “Biden Rule” as 
justification — acknowledging 
that neither side would have 
expected any different a decision 
had the shoe been on the other 
foot. It is crucial to recall that 
in 1992 when George H.W. Bush 
was president and Biden was 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, Biden established 
that Supreme Court vacancies 
should not be filled in the midst 
of a presidential election.

In deference to the fact that 

Trump won the election, and 
has offered his nominee for 
consideration, Mitch McConnell 
has argued, “The Senate should 
respect the result of the election 
and treat this newly elected 
president’s nominee in the same 
way the nominees of other newly 
elected presidents have been 

treated.” He also has pointed 
out two examples in which 
up-or-down votes were given 
under Democratic presidents: 
Ginsburg and Breyer under 
Clinton and Sotomayor and 
Kagan under Obama.

Certainly, 
recent 
history 

provides precedent for an up-or-
down vote and no filibuster.

Some 
Democrats, 
such 
as 

Sen. Joe Manchin (D–W.Va.), 
have recognized that the left’s 
intransigence 
threatens 
the 

institution of the Senate as 
we know it. Yet, despite this 
sensibility, 
other 
Democrats 

appear 
to 
be 
consistently 

inconsistent. Schumer feels quite 
entitled to filibuster Gorsuch’s 
confirmation, effectively allowing 
a minority vote of 41 to prevent 
cloture — hardly an up-or-down 
vote when a minority can block 
a confirmation. And Schumer 
argues that invoking the nuclear 
option would be wrong today, 
even though Harry Reid felt it was 
warranted in 2013.

As to the justification for a 

filibuster and the imperative 
for changing the rules (i.e., 
invoking the nuclear option) 
Schumer’s 
own 
Senate 

colleague Elizabeth Warren felt 
very differently than Schumer 
about both in 2013. From a floor 
speech on Nov. 13, 2013, she 
criticized filibusters and called 
for a rules change: “We need 
to call out these filibusters for 
what they are — naked attempts 
to nullify the results of the last 
presidential election … we have 
a responsibility to protect and 
defend our democracy, and 
that includes protecting the 
neutrality of our courts and 
preserving the constitutional 
power 
of 
the 
president 
to 

nominate 
highly 
qualified 

people to court vacancies.”

Sens. Schumer and Warren 

must realize that “biting off 
their nose to spite their face” 
accomplishes nothing productive. 
If the nuclear option takes place, 
the Senate may very well approve 
even more conservative judges 
during Trump’s administration 
with only a majority requirement.

One thing is for certain: The 

Republicans are fully aware that 
the filibuster is merely a naked 
attempt to nullify the results of 
the last presidential election. 
And the aftertaste of the nuclear 
option will be worse than not 
considering Merrick Garland.

Prioritize transgender rights
A

t the end of February, the Trump administration revoked the 
Obama-era “Dear Colleague” letter, which extended Title IX 
protections against sex discrimination in schools to protect 

gender identity and allow transgender students to use the bathrooms 
that corresponded with their gender identities. By backtracking on this 
policy, the federal administration has significantly weakened schools’ 
incentives to allow students to use restrooms that correspond to the 
gender they identify with. Shortly after, the University of Michigan’s 
Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs passed a resolution 
that reaffirmed the right for people on campus to use the restrooms that 
correspond with their gender identities. The Michigan Daily’s Editorial 
Board commends the University for continuing to uphold previous 
guidelines protecting students. While we believe that transgender rights 
should be protected at a federal level, the state and other local actors — 
such as the University — have a duty to enforce these recommendations 
when the current federal administration will not.

was met with harsh criticism for portraying protesting and the

Kugler aims to be a 
starter in fifth year 

Patrick Kugler was quick 

to say he never considered 
transferring.

But the fifth-year senior 

center certainly couldn’t have 
been blamed for doing so — 
or for at least considering it. 
Through his first four years on 
the Michigan football team, he 
played in just five games, failing 
to carve out a consistent role on 
the offensive line.

Time 
and 

time 
again, 

Kugler 
found 

himself on the 
wrong end of 
the depth chart. 
So 
it 
would 

have 
been 

understandable 
had he decided 
to 
leave 

Michigan 
and 
pursue 
a 

graduate 
transfer 
elsewhere 

for his final season of eligibility 
— perhaps somewhere like the 
University of Texas El-Paso, 
where his father, Sean Kugler, is 
the head coach.

Kugler 
shot 
that 
down 

Tuesday night, though, saying 
it would be “Michigan through 
and through.”

Kugler’s career thus far may 

seem like an unexpected turn 
for a player who many expected 
to be the anchor of a powerful 
offense.

As the No. 1 ranked center 

in the nation with offers from 
nearly 
everywhere, 
Kugler 

arrived in Ann Arbor as one 
of 
the 
most 
highly-touted 

members 
of 
a 
ballyhooed 

offensive 
line 
class 
under 

former Michigan coach Brady 
Hoke. The expectations for him 
and the rest of his linemates 
could not have been more 
overstated.

Yet, 
that 

vision 
of 

a 
mauling 

offensive 
line 

that 
would 

finally 
give 

Hoke his desired 
power-running 
game never took 
effect.

After 
Hoke 

was 
fired 

following 
Kugler’s 
second 

year, current head coach Jim 
Harbaugh stepped in. Harbaugh 
brought an entirely different 
staff and mentality, with Kugler 
calling 
the 
new 
four-hour 

practices an initial “shock.”

But he stuck around, even 

when 
many 
of 
his 
peers 

didn’t. One by one, each of the 
offensive linemen from that 
2013 recruiting class left the 
team. 
And 
when 
fifth-year 

senior guard David Dawson 
announced earlier this spring 
that he would be transferring 
to Iowa State for his final year, 
Kugler officially became the last 
man standing.

He is older and wiser now, 

which may prove to be a boon 
for a team as inexperienced as 
Michigan is — especially on 
the offensive line, which will 

enter the year with just 48 total 
starts, 38 of which belong to 
senior center Mason Cole.

One of those 48 does belong to 

Kugler. He started in last year’s 
season opener against Hawaii at 
left guard in place of an injured 
redshirt senior Ben Braden. It 
wasn’t his natural position, but 
he made do. Braden, though, 
returned shortly, which left 
Kugler out of a spot. And, when 
then-sophomore 
offensive 

tackle Grant Newsome went 
down with a season-ending 

injury, the next 
man 
up 
was 

a 
freshman, 

Ben 
Bredeson, 

instead 
of 

Kugler.

That 

brief 
taste 

of 
a 
starting 

position 
left 

Kugler wanting 
more, especially 
after 
realizing 

he may not have approached the 
competition with the requisite 
intensity.

“You’ve 
got 
to 
outwork 

everybody,” 
Kugler 
said. 

“There’d be times where I’d 
probably get outworked last 
year or I wouldn’t do the extra 
work the past couple years, so 
it’s just about trying to get in 
there and get all the extra work 
that you possibly can.”

This time around, he says, 

he has done “all the little 
things” to try and get on the 
field. That has meant seeking 
more treatment after practices 
and workouts and trying to 
eat healthier — Kugler says he 
has been trying to cut down 
on pizza, his favorite food — 
while continuing to familiarize 
himself with the offense.

“It’s not a new system, but it’s 

a new terminology a little bit 
with (assistant head coach and 

passing 
game 

coordinator) 
Pep 
Hamilton 

here,” 
Kugler 

said. “So it’s just 
about 
getting 

the calls down, 
and they put a lot 
more emphasis 
on making calls 
with the center, 
so that’s been 
the key for me, 

just trying to get everything 
down. And it’s been going really 
well so far.”

Perhaps those adjustments, 

along with his improved work 
ethic, will lead to Kugler finding 
success in his final year. Either 
way, he’s not leaving Michigan 
— not before he gives it one last 
shot.

“I think that I’m one of the top 

five — everyone thinks they’re 
one of the top five,” Kugler said. 
“If I’m not starting in spring 
ball, I’ll earn that during (fall) 
camp, or if I don’t, I’ll try to be 
the best senior leader that I can 
regardless of what my role is on 
the team.

“… It’s my fifth year so it’s my 

last go-around, (and) I want to 
prove to everyone that I belong 
here and (that) I’m a Michigan 
man.”

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Fifth-year senior center Patrick Kugler came to Michigan as the No. 1 center.

“That’s been 
the key for me, 
just trying to 
get everything 

down”

Lugbauer’s surge powers Michigan’s offense

Entering 
the 
season, 

expectations for junior third 
baseman Drew Lugbauer were 
high, and deservingly so. After 
a sophomore season in which 
he hit .294 and slugged .483 
with seven home runs and 47 
runs batted-in, the preseason 
Big Ten Player to Watch had 
established himself as a left-
handed power source in the 
heart of Michigan’s lineup. 

Through the 15 games of the 

season, however, that version 
of Lugbauer was nowhere to 
be found. Leading up to the 
Wolverines’ first home game, 
he possessed a .164 batting 
average and had struck out 21 
times in 55 at-bats.

But a return to Ray Fisher 

Stadium was seemingly all that 
was needed for Lugbauer to 
find his form.

Since 
blowing 
open 

Michigan’s 
home 
opener 

against Northern Illinois with 
a two-out grand slam, the third 
baseman has been on a tear, 
hitting .403 with six home 
runs and 24 RBIs — good for a 
slugging percentage of .807. He 
was recognized by the Big Ten 
as the Conference Player of the 

Week for his performances last 
week against Toledo, Central 
Michigan and Penn State.

But 
with 
Lugbauer, 
it 

hasn’t just been about the raw 
statistics. It’s about how he 
records them.

Power 
is 
the 
defining 

characteristic of Lugbauer’s 
game. At 6-foot-3 and 220 
pounds, he’s a prototypical 
middle-of-the-order 
slugger 

with the ability to drive the 
ball out of the 
park 
in 
any 

direction.

Last 
week, 

that 
was 
on 

full 
display. 

Even 
though 

the 
contest 

had 
been 

effectively 
decided in the 
Wolverines’ 
favor, Lugbauer 
provided the defining moment 
of Wednesday’s game against 
Central 
Michigan. 
In 
the 

seventh inning, he hit a deep 
shot to right field that finally 
landed on the roof of the 
neighboring 
indoor 
track 

and field building, a hit that 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
described 
as 
an 
“absolute 

bomb”.

“Farthest ball I’ve ever seen 

hit, for us or against us, in 
the five years I’ve been here,” 
Bakich said.

That’s 
not 
the 
only 

extraordinary feat Lugbauer 
has proven himself capable 
of. Against Penn State on 
Saturday, 
he 
swatted 
two 

opposite-field 
home 
runs, 

including a first-inning blast 
that landed in the outfield of 
the adjoining Alumni Field and 

a 
fifth-inning 

drive down the 
line that cleared 
the 25-foot-high 
left-field wall.

“I don’t care 

who 
you 
are, 

that’s really hard 
to do as a hitter,” 
Bakich said. “To 
not only hit the 
ball 
the 
other 

way but hit it 

with such authority you clear 
the fence.

“He’s showing line to line 

power, and he’s really elevating 
himself as one of the best power 
hitters in the conference. He’s 
a kid who works extremely 
hard and has created this for 
himself.”

But even when Lugbauer 

struggled to find his rhythm at 

the plate, he was able to make 
his moments count. Despite 
his subpar batting average and 
slugging for the first month 
of the season, he still was 
tied for second on the team in 
RBIs with 10 — a testament to 
Lugbauer’s work ethic and his 
ability to remain focused.

“Even when the hits weren’t 

falling for him, he prepared 
the same way and invested just 
as much time,” Bakich said. 
“He’s not going to do anything 
different.”

Certainly, Lugbauer draws 

the most attention for the 
barrage 
of 
home 
runs 
he 

launches into the stratosphere. 
But in the same fashion as 
his training, there’s nothing 
different about his approach 
at the plate, whether the end 
result is a line-drive single up 
the middle or a towering blast 
to right field.

“I just try to put a good swing 

on it,” he said. “My swing is 
kind of more geared towards 
(power), so I just try to find a 
good pitch to hit and get super 
selective in doing that.”

But with the way Lugbauer 

has been batting lately, there’s 
a good chance he won’t be 
seeing nearly as many good 
pitches to hit in the future.

Seizing catcher role, Alexander aids Betsa’s pitching

When 
sophomore 
catcher 

Katie Alexander visits senior 
right-hander Megan Betsa in 
the circle between pitches, the 
message is usually simple: just 
breathe.

As complex as a softball 

pitcher’s throwing technique can 
be, that’s what the pair focuses on 
in the middle of pressure-cooker 
games.

Alexander’s 
pointer 
comes 

from an offseason yoga program, 
which was originally intended to 
relieve lingering pain in Betsa’s 
back 
and 
shoulder. 
Instead, 

yoga has become the basis for 
Alexander’s fix to any fluster 
the Michigan softball team’s ace 
might experience.

“When (Betsa) breathes and 

focuses on spin, then it happens 
for her,” Alexander said.

Even 
in 
the 
best 
of 

performances 
for 
Betsa, 

Alexander’s 
presence 
is 

consistent.

In the seventh inning of a 

nearly flawless March effort 
against Kent State, Betsa became 
visibly frustrated after walking 
a batter to bring the game-tying 
run to the plate.

But 
there 
was 
Alexander, 

jogging out to the circle to tell the 
starter exactly what she needed 
to 
hear. 
Betsa 
subsequently 

struck out the final two batters of 
the game, completing the shutout 
and her fourth-career no-hitter.

“Katie has gotten comfortable 

communicating 
with 
(the 

pitchers) and letting them know 
what they need to do better,” said 
pitching coach Jen Brundage. 
“Anytime 
the 
catcher 
takes 

charge and can go out to the 
mound to calm the pitcher down, 
it’s a good thing and a sign of 
maturity in that catcher.”

Added Michigan coach Carol 

Hutchins: “Catchers are selfless. 
They’re 
there 
to 
make 
the 

pitchers feel good. Tell her what 
she needs to know and tell her 
what she needs to hear. You want 

them to beat as one heart — that’s 
for sure.”

Reaping 
the 
benefits 
of 

Alexander’s mound visits, Betsa 
is on the best stretch of her 
career. In the past three weeks, 
she’s tallied seven complete-game 
shutouts, two no-hitters and 
three-straight Big Ten Pitcher of 
the Week honors. 

As the season progresses, the 

chemistry between the pair on 
and off the field continues to 
grow. Though the pair are two 
years apart, Alexander considers 
Betsa “a best friend.”

That relationship is apparent 

throughout their starts together, 
as Betsa and Alexander are 
almost always the first to high-
five each other after the final out 
of an inning.

But that chemistry is still 

relatively young.

Alexander caught just 13 games 

last season, spending most of the 

season as the bullpen catcher 
behind both junior Aidan Falk and 
sophomore Alex Sobczak. After 
Falk moved back to first base this 
season, however, a battle between 

Alexander and Sobczak ensued.

And Sobczak — using 29 

appearances from 2016 to boost 
her resume — was called upon to 
start six of the first seven games 
for the Wolverines. 

Recently, however, Alexander’s 

hot bat convinced Hutchins to 
make her the go-to catcher. In 23 
starts, Alexander has hit .293 with 
eight RBI and a homerun, besting 
Sobczak’s .200 batting average.

“Katie totally took advantage 

of her opportunities,” Hutchins 
said. “She’s provided some great 
offense, and she’s a great spark. 
She took over that position.”

Behind the plate, Alexander 

excels at blocking pitches in the 
dirt — essential to catching for 
Betsa, who bounces breaking balls 
to garner swinging third strikes.

“She does a really nice job 

smothering the ball,” Hutchins 
said. “That’s a big quality when 
you have a pitcher like Betsa, who 
lives off throwing it in the dirt 
and making them swing.”

But to prepare for a larger role 

this season, Alexander needed 
to improve defensively, putting a 
strong focus on framing pitches 
and adjusting to Betsa’s repertoire.

Alexander spent most of the 

summer practicing with Sobczak, 
working on not tipping off Betsa’s 
rise ball by “going up with the 
pitch” rather than giving a high 
target prior to the pitch.

That, along with an increased 

focus on framing pitches, has 
allowed Betsa to nip corners 
and notch a nation-leading 221 
strikeouts.

“Whether it’s her body position 

or the way she catches the ball, 
she’s getting a lot more calls back 
there,” Betsa said. “It’s helping 
me out a lot.”

Thanks to Alexander, Betsa’s 

transition to a new catcher for 
the second straight season has 
occurred 
with 
no 
apparent 

hitches.

But if the ace does endure 

any problems in the circle, she 
knows Alexander will visit with a 
straightforward message.

Just breathe.

Reunited, Williams experiences her final game with twin sister

It happened after all the 

frenzy and after all the shouts of 
excitement and team hugs. After 
realizing that her team was the 
first Michigan women’s basketball 
team to win a championship and 
hang a banner at Crisler Center. 

It was after she got to look up 

at the scoreboard and see her 
team had beaten Georgia Tech, 
89-79, in the final of the Women’s 
National Invitation Tournament. 
And it was after playing the final 
game of her collegiate career in a 
Michigan jersey. 

After all of this, senior guard 

Danielle Williams got to hug her 
identical twin sister, Dominique. 
Dominique had hopped a red-
eye from UCLA — where she 
plays on the Bruins’ women’s 
basketball team — to surprise her 
sister in the middle of pregame 
warmups. Danielle was shocked, 
especially 
as 
she 
had 
been 

trying to FaceTime and call her 
periodically throughout the day. 

They 
embraced 
tightly 
at 

the team’s bench, both of them 
slightly emotional. 

After 
all 
of 
the 
hysteric 

celebration, Danielle was able to 

describe why that moment was so 
emotional. 

“I think she’s the greatest 

person that I know,” Williams 

said. “I will tell everybody 
that. We always joke like, ‘oh 
who’s the better twin?’ Not just 
in basketball, but in life. But 
honestly, I would always pick her. 
She’s the better one every single 
day and every single time, no 
matter what. 

“She’s just that great, that 

selfless, that wonderful, and I’m 
just … I can’t believe she’s here, 
and it makes this that much more 
wonderful.”

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico has just as much praise for 
Danielle herself. Earlier in the year 
and throughout Williams’ career, 
Barnes Arico has commended 
Williams for her contributions 
off the court, saying, “there’s not 
a day that goes by that I’m not 
thankful that Danielle Williams is 
in the program.” 

Barnes Arico even went so 

far as to add: “Every program 
needs a Danielle Williams. If my 
child could ever be like Danielle 
Williams, I would’ve hit a home 
run.” 

Laura Williams, the twins’ 

mother, described the moment 
that Danielle realized Dominique 
would be her lifelong friend. 
The two, according to their 
mom, are inseparable. And when 
Dominique walked into Calihan 
Hall, Danielle’s “jaw dropped.” 

The 
athletes 
decided 
to 

commit to different schools, a 
difficult decision for the two of 
them, but one they knew they 
needed to forge their own paths. 
But, 
according 
to 
Danielle, 

the duo still talks constantly, 
making the distance feel minute. 
Other things, too, tie the twins 

closer together. For example, 
Dominique was also selected as 
a team captain by her peers and, 
like Danielle, Dominique also 
wears the number 20 to honor 
WNBA Indiana Fever guard 
Briann January. 

“I just think (the game was) 

great,” Dominique said. “Either 
way, it’s great. Win or lose, I’m 
proud of her. She’s done so much 
on and off the court, I’m just so 
proud of her. I’m excited for what 
she’s done in a Michigan uniform.”

Despite not playing as many 

minutes or stuffing the stat sheet 
as much as other players, Williams 
was voted as a team captain for 
two consecutive years. Some 
teammates even refer to her as 
‘the Mom.’ Every single Wolverine 
felt motivated to win the WNIT 
for Danielle and her fellow senior 
guard Siera Thompson. 

In her final year, Williams 

averaged 1.9 points per game, 2.8 
rebounds and played an average of 
17 minutes, though she appeared 
in all 37 games and started in 21. 
As a junior, she earned Academic 
All-Big Ten and her third varsity 
letter. 

Williams will leave behind a 

gap in the roster, as most seniors 
do. Both she and Thompson were 
Barnes Arico’s first recruits for 
Michgian, making the pair a 
special class for the coach. 

In the WNIT championship 

game, 
Williams 
grabbed 

two 
offensive 
rebounds 
and 

three defensive rebounds and 
contributed four points to the 
team’s total. She ended her 
college career by playing 35 of the 
55 total minutes of the game. 

Despite 
any 
personal 

achievements Williams may have 
had this season, she still remains 
humble to her team. 

“I just don’t have any words,” 

Williams said. “It took everybody, 
and it took everything. Everybody 
contributed 
and 
everybody 

stepped up on the team. I can go 
through every single person on 
our team and things that they 
did tonight that they worked 
throughout the whole season 
for. We earned it, we definitely 
earned it.” 

And, at the end, she got to earn 

it with her better half watching.

Seventy years later, all 
roads lead to Fleetwood

The peculiar Ann Arbor diner is riddled with stories and history

THE MICHIGAN DAILY

Ann Arbor’s own Fleetwood Diner

“There’s an old payphone 

back here that doesn’t work,” 
said server Rob Bell to me one 
hazy afternoon, as I stopped 
by the restaurant where he 
worked. “One night this total 
crazy person was talking on 
it … one of our regulars dealt 
with it and went over there 
and hung up on the phone and 
the guy was like, ‘That’s really 
rude’ and (the regular) was 
like, ‘You gotta go man.’ ”

Welcome to the Fleetwood 

Diner.

Just 
hugging 
the 
edge 

of 
downtown 
Ann 
Arbor, 

Fleetwood 
squats 
at 
the 

corner of two intersecting 
streets, its brightly striped 
awning a beacon against the 
monochromatic 
pavement 

line. 
It 
promises 
food 

‘round the clock, a pair of 
the 
dirtiest 
bathrooms 
to 

ever 
grace 
mankind 
and, 

most importantly, a dining 
experience like no other.

The first time I visited 

Fleetwood, it was as a wide-
eyed freshman late one random 
Tuesday night. Eager to escape 
the confines of my residence 
hall, I grabbed the hand of 
my closest friend at the time 
— a girl whom I knew for all 
of three days — and marched 
us both resolutely toward the 
infamous diner. Situated so far 
away from Central Campus, it 
had almost seemed like a myth 
— the house that all the older 
kids in your neighborhood had 
sworn was haunted but nobody 
dared visit. When we passed 
underneath its flickering neon 
sign for the first time that 
night, I had half expected the 
inside of the diner to be filled 
with ghostly mist: hallowed 
ground 
nestled 
between 

railroad tracks and a tattoo 
parlor.

Instead, 
disturbingly 

normal 
fluorescent 
lights 

stabbed the corners of our 
eyes as we were hastily seated 
at a table in the corner. The 
menus haphazardly tossed in 
our general direction were 
lined with creases, various 
stains 
forming 
technicolor 

abstractions across the pages. 
Eager to play the role of 
beguiling tourist, we both 
ordered what Fleetwood is 
most acclaimed for: the Hippie 
Hash.

Our 
food 
arrived 
as 
a 

verifiable 
feast 
heaped 
on 

top of plates spiderwebbed 
with 
cracks. 
We 
worked 

through our meals in relative 
silence, engrossed in studying 
the 
multitude 
of 
stickers 

that 
embellished 
almost 

every available flat surface. 
Portraying everything from 
clean-cut business logos to 
elaborate illustrations, every 
decal was distinctive. In that 
moment, they seemed like 
fingerprints of a city that was 
still very much unknown to me. 
The kaleidoscope of shapes and 
colors was subtly compelling, 
enticing 
unfamiliar 
eyes 

to 
repeatedly 
wander 
the 

expanse of the diner. There 
was an unconventionality in 

even the simplest of objects: 
a green ribbon tied around a 
random mustard bottle; tables 
that were constantly pushed 
into 
new 
configurations 

to 
accommodate 
incoming 

customers. I ate. I observed.

Fleetwood spat us back onto 

the street around an hour later 
— uncomfortably full and still 
reeling. I was more than a little 
surprised and, walking back up 
the endless line of East Liberty, 
more than a little disappointed. 
Fleetwood hadn’t been the 
fantastical experience I had 
romanticized. There were no 
performances of Weird Shit.

Instead, 
the 
abnormality 

of 
Fleetwood 
manifested 

itself in deceptively modest 
ways. Rather than the mass 
pandemonium 
I 
had 
been 

expecting, 
several 
bizarre 

fragments of eccentricity all 
occurred 
simultaneously, 

scattered within the cramped 
space. A man seated on top of a 
haggard barstool had endlessly 
stirred his coffee with a single 

pinky finger while our waitress 
harassed a set of poor-tipping 
customers. The long tendrils of 
her hair whipped around like 
snakes, almost colliding with 
the people who had sat at the 
table adjacent to ours. They 
had taken no notice, focused 
more on decorating their empty 
plates with ketchup bottles 
held aloft like paintbrushes. 
In the other corner of the 
restaurant, 
detached 
from 

it all, a man had fallen fast 
asleep, cheek pillowed on a 
stack of pancakes.

Fleetwood Diner’s brand of 

peculiarity manifests in the 
little things.

Minuscule 
details 
that 

include the building itself. 
Like any piece of architecture 
with a history, the diner seems 
to have a life of its own. The 
cacophony of scrawled graffiti 
signatures and tattered pieces 
of art on the walls spiral like 
the rings of a redwood, each 
tattered layer corresponding 
with a particular time period. 
Underneath 
the 
dust 
and 

discoloration, the checkered 
tile of the floor stretches into 
roots that are wrapped around 
the very heart of the city; a tree 
grows on South Ashley Street.

However, first and foremost, 

it is the people who trail in and 
out of the diner that truly make 
its space come to life.

Fleetwood is contingent on 

its customers in a way that is 
distinctive from surrounding 
restaurants. Their influence 

lies beyond solely monetary 
value; the very essence of 
Fleetwood, 
the 
qualities 

that make it unique, is only 
maintained as a result of the 
people who walk in through 
its doors. After all, it is an 
interactive diner — one that is 
able to be altered by any person 
who decides they want to leave 
their mark, whether that be 
through a sticker plastered on 
off-white walls or hurriedly 
engraved initials on a table 
corner.

It is this communal quality 

that 
makes 
Fleetwood 
so 

singular. Within its crooked 
walls, it holds various stories 
from various individuals. It 
is a restaurant anybody can 
stumble into and instantly feel 
welcome.

The Fleetwood Diner has 

remained stubbornly relevant 
since its creation in 1947. Not 
one for being overly fixated 
on remodeling, it seems to 
let its different parts grow 
independently, resulting in a 
restaurant that is a blend of 
retro and modern. Fleetwood 
can’t be pinned down to an 
exact time period. Eighties-
esque 
black-and-white 

barstools stand next to decal 
based 
off 
contemporary 

pop culture. The primitive 
cash register is a tan-and-
brown 
monstrosity 
always 

surrounded by a sea of sleek 
iPhones. A mess of contrasts, 
Fleetwood appears to exist in 
a slightly different world than 
the rest of Ann Arbor.

Even 
the 
restaurant 

workers seem like they have 
been molded from Fleetwood 
itself, traversing the cramped 
corners with a practiced ease.

Take Rob Bell. A waiter at 

the diner for almost 13 years, 
he balances numerous tasks 
with an easy smile. As he runs 
from the cash register to the 
kitchen to customers’ tables, 
he still somehow finds spare 
time to share accounts of his 
most memorable Fleetwood 
moments.

“A lady brought a birdcage 

in here in the middle of the 
night,” Bell said. “Like maybe 
12:30, 1:00 a.m., and she had 
two birds in there and one of 
them was dead … she thought it 
was sleeping.”

Though not as surreal as 

deceased birds, Bell went on to 
describe the numerous small 
fights that occurred within 
Fleetwood’s 
history. 
The 

relative tranquility in his voice 
as he described tables being 
flipped and food being thrown 
made it seem like late-night 
diner 
brawls 
were 
normal 

incidents.

“A guy threw the cash 

register at me about 10 years 
ago,” Bell said.

When 
asked 
why, 
Bell 

responded, “He threatened to 
kick my ass so I said, ‘C’mon, 
player, I got the knife.’ ”

Iconic.
Apart 
from 
the 
overall 

amiability, there was also a 
distinct candidness as Bell 
talked about the occasional 
dead fowl and airborne cash 
register: 
he 
didn’t 
strive 

to make Fleetwood appear 
picture-perfect.

A picture of a Ukranian Easter table
The cultural customs of 
foreign foods and holidays

Erika Shevchek chronicles her life in food, family, and tradition

I’ve had a type of innate luck 

— I was raised in a home where 
my parents, heavily anchored 
in their heritage and religion, 
brought me up to eat … and to 
eat well.

My family, a combination 

of Ukrainian and Hungarian 
backgrounds, are firm believers 
in the power of food and the 
style of embedding it into our 
everyday lives. Whether that 
be religious holidays, family 
reunions or a weekend meal, 
food is and will always be the 
seal of my family.

2003
Ukrainian 
Orthodox 

Christmas Eve consisted of 
anxiously waiting. We waited 
for the Ukrainian Santa (yes, 
he was different from the 
North Pole Santa), to come to 
our house and for our ancestors 
to return from the heavens 
and eat our Kutia. We put the 
Kutia, a sweet rice dish made 
with berries, poppy seeds and 
honey, out on the dining room 
table along with pictures of 
my deceased grandparents. My 
family would have a moment 
of silence and then head off to 
bed.

Christmas 
morning, 
the 

Kutia would be gone, and the 
spoons would lie in the bowls 
after being used. Six-year-old 
me was more than spooked out 
— I was infatuated.

“Mommy, Baba and Dede 

came last night!” I exclaimed 
to my mother, excited that the 
grandparents I never got to 
meet returned to the dining 
room that previous night. As 
I matured, I unfortunately 
found out that my parents ate 
the Kutia after my sister and I 
went to sleep.

Nonetheless, as a memorable 

and holy ritual, I still try to 
think that Baba and Dede and 
the rest of my ancestors eat our 
tasty Kutia and are with us on 
Christmas holidays.

2008
The long hours standing in 

a foreign church are tedious, 
but when the congregation and 
Father Frank move outside to 
the front yard, I know it is time 
to bless the Easter basket (and 
church was finally over).

Unique in everyone’s basket 

are 
always 
assortments 
of 

kobasa 
(Ukrainian 
pork 

sausage), 
paska 
(a 
sweet 

bread), cheese blintzes, butter, 
cream 
cheese, 
red 
horse 

radish, mustard and pysankas 
(Ukrainian decorated Easter 
eggs). 
Father 
Frank 
walks 

around, throws holy water 
onto each basket and blesses 
them.

~

“Christos Voz Crest! … He 

has risen,” I say to my aunt 
as I nibble at the kobasa on 
the Easter Sunday morning. 
She slices her famous and 
delectable paska; she replies to 
me, “Voistynu Voskres” or “He 
has risen indeed.”

We set the dining room 

table for our annual Orthodox 
brunch — a space sprinkled 
with 
vibrant 
colors 
and 

dishes. 
Bagels, 
lox, 
cream 

cheese, the condiments from 
the Easter basket and orange 
juice decorate the Ukrainian 
tablecloth. My sister, mom, dad 
and aunt all gather around the 
table, and we each grab a “Uki 
egg” and peel away. 

2013
My cousins and I sit around 

the fire pit on a beating-hot 
August Saturday. Sweating, we 
catch up on school, jobs and 
significant others, the typical 
thing to do at a family reunion. 
The uncles play horseshoes and 
smoke cigars while the aunts 
finish up the chicken goulash, 
stuffed cabbage and nokedli (a 
type of mini Hungarian noodle 
dumpling).

It seems odd that a group 

of 
50 
or 
so 
Hungarians 

would make a huge fire on an 
80-degree day, but that is how 
we “sutni szalona,” or “roast 
the bacon fat.”

With rye bread in one hand 

and a metal spear stabbed 
into a slab of bacon fat in the 
other, I prepare myself for the 
Hungarian-style food dish we 
unconditionally love.

When the bacon fat begins 

to turn a dark brown, we 
slap it onto our rye bread —
pressing the fat until it is fully 
covered in grease and looks 
dirty (hence, we call it “dirty 
bread”). We add some roasted 
onions and peppers on top (or 
other veggies if preferred), and 
we eat in silence for the next 
few minutes as our taste buds 
become supremely satisfied.

Later, I grab some csoroge, 

a 
deep-fried 
cookie 
with 

powdered sugar, before my 
cousins tell me to get my butt 
to the front yard for a family 
volleyball game.

2016
My dad, his sister and I sat 

at our favorite sushi place in 
my hometown. My dad popped 
some takoyaki in his mouth, 
and I watched him chew the 
fried octopus ball.

“C’mon, just try one E,” he 

said trying to convince me. 
But the now-vegetarian me 
looked at my father blankly and 
continued to eat my edamame.

In that moment, I truly 

reflected on what it means to 
be a vegetarian and how it is a 
privilege. I thought of how my 
entire life I was brought up to 
eat meat, both Ukrainian and 
Hungarian, and how I never 
second-guessed it.

We discussed the concept 

of modern-day diet choices 
— how once there was a time 
where one did not have the 
freedom to restrict or expand 
his or her diet. My aunt looked 
at me, with a twist of history 
and sadness in her eyes.

She 
explained 
to 
me 

truthfully about what life was 
like coming to America with 
her 
parents. 
Coming 
over 

from Ukraine at the age of 4, 
my aunt was launched into 
the rough area of Frankford, 
Philadelphia, 
as 
a 
poor 

immigrant.

“Vegetables 
and 
potatoes 

were all we could afford, 
so we ate a lot of stew,” she 
continued. It all began to click 
when I realized why my Dad’s 
stews are always so hearty and 
delicious. “If there was meat on 
the table, you were considered 
really lucky.”

Feeling guilty, I listened 

earnestly as I pushed around 
my veggie sushi on my plate. 
Vegetables were not a choice 
for a diet, but for survival; meat 
was not frowned upon, but was 
seen as a true luxury.

My 
aunt, 
remembering 

the hardships of being an 
immigrant, and I, knowing 
that I have the ability to pick 
and choose what I eat, sat in 
the same booth. We ate in 
the same booth, but we came 
from 
completely 
different 

places, had severely different 
childhoods and had an entirely 
different view on food itself.

I 
thanked 
them 
for 

everything 
they 
did, 
for 

everything Baba and Dede did 
… I thanked them for giving me 
the opportunity to even sit in a 
Japanese restaurant and be a 
vegetarian.

no pretense of false honesty 
in order to gain customer 
approval.

“(Fleetwood) is a very real 

place … you can tell that the 
people who work here aren’t 
faking it,” Bell said. “And I 
think a lot of people can tell 
that and appreciate that it’s 
not fake … we say, ‘I appreciate 
you,’ and we appreciate you; we 
say, ‘Get the fuck out,’ and we 
mean ‘Get the fuck out.’ ”

I thought the plain-spoken 

forthrightness was refreshing. 

And 
if 
the 
popularity 
of 

Fleetwood is anything to go off, 
many other individuals do as 
well.

The 
biggest 
spectacle 

of 
Fleetwood 
lies 
in 
its 

genuineness. What you see is 
what you get. Open and honest, 
Fleetwood truly is a diner for 
the people: accessible to all, 
regardless of whether it was 
hobbled into at 3 a.m. for respite 
or purposefully sought out at 11 
a.m. for a family brunch.

The Fleetwood Diner has 

a knack of quietly storing 
memories within its rickety 
walls. It’s not extravagant, 
nor 
is 
it 
embellished, 
but 

everyone 
manages 
to 
have 

their own set of outlandishly 
distinctive experiences. The 
diner manages to represent the 
surrounding community, all its 
traditions and idiosyncrasies, 
with a tireless integrity that 
persuades customers to keep 
coming back.

Well, that and the Hippie

Srijith 
Gopinathan 

— 
executive 
chef 
to 
San 

Francisco’s Taj Campton Place 
Hotel — found his career path 
to be fraught with what he says 
were “big time complications.” 
Hailing from southern India, 
Gopinathan had as traditional 
of an upbringing as any of 
his regional contemporaries 
possibly could — a mother 
who (at least initially) wasn’t 
the happiest at his culinary 
aspirations, and a family of 
engineers, doctors and the like 
to supplement that.

“I certainly was a black 

sheep,” Gopinathan said. But 
his time off the beaten path 
seems to have paid dividends. 
As of 2016, the Campton Place 
boasts 
two 
Michelin 
stars 

under Gopinathan’s reign, a 
feat very few restaurants in 
the world have achieved. In 
addition to that, Gopinathan 
holds the prestige of being 
the only Indian chef to have 
reached two star status as well. 
His role as a purveyor of fine 
Indian dining in the Western 
world is something he calls “a 
big responsibility.”

“Indian food is one of the 

finest and flavorsome cuisines 
in the world. Unfortunately 
Indian cuisine in West has 
not 
been 
represented 
by 

professionals. 
We 
are 
just 

getting 
there,” 
Gopinathan 

said. And his team at Campton 
Place have been quietly and 
admirably leading the charge 
in that respect. “We are an 
example for Indian-influenced 
fine 
dining 
… 
[and] 
we 

communicate that well to our 

guests.”

And there’s stark truth in 

that statement. His rotating 
menu 
consistently 
offers 

the best ingredients Indian 
cuisine has to offer, while 
also channeling the kind of 
avant-garde 
experimentation 

that can be better associated 
with the likes of Ferran Adrià 
and Heston Blumenthal — but 
reaching that point took an 
extensive 
professional, 
and 

philosophical, education.

After pursuing a bachelor’s 

degree in Hotel Management, 
Gopinathan’s career path took 
him to a variety of destinations 

across the globe. Following 
his studies in India, he spent 
time at a variety of hotels in 
India before taking the helm 
at the Taj Exotica hotel in the 
Maldives. He later took to 
America to further his culinary 
education in Hyde Park, NY, 
at the Culinary Institute of 
America. Afterward, he found 
himself in the kitchen of famed 
two star restaurant Le Manoir 
aux Quat’Saisons, in Oxford, 
England, where he further 

honed his craft and better 
mastered 
the 
fundamentals 

of 
Michelin-tier 
European 

cuisine. It’s these experiences 
that Gopinathan said affirmed 
his choice of taking up the 
profession of being a chef.

“That’s when I figured I 

really wanted to cook and I 
enjoyed doing it,” he said.

Gopinathan has been the 

executive chef at the Campton 
Place since 2008. In that time, 
he has made a distinct name 
for himself thanks to his skill 
in finding a seamless cohesion 
between traditional southern 
Indian cuisine and classical, 
European 
fine 
dining. 

Touching on the fundamentals 
of 
his 
style, 
Gopinathan 

emphasizes that his adherence 
to quality ingredients is what 
helps bring his visions to 
fruition.

“It all starts with right 

ingredients. I always advocate 
for the best possible raw 
materials and try to maintain 
the integrity of the main 
ingredients … without masking 
[them] 
much,” 
Gopinathan 

said. 
“San 
Francisco 
also 

spoiled me much by providing 
me with [some] of the best 
ingredients in the world.”

Gopinathan’s 
ambitions 

aren’t settling anytime soon, 
either. After earning his second 
Michelin star in 2016, his eyes 
are still set on bringing fine 
Indian dining to the Western 
mainstream. Lately, he cites 
his 
Indian 
contemporaries’ 

culinary successes in London 
as a point of inspiration for his 
own visions.

“We should and will be part 

of mainstream scene here in 
less than five years. I’m sure of 
that.”

The cover of Sarah Michelle Gellar’s new cookbook
The undead to uncooked: 
‘Fun with Food’ review
Sarah Michelle Gellar’s cookbook matches ease with taste

We all know Sarah Michelle 

Gellar 
for 
her 
empowering 

performance 
as 
Buffy 
the 

Vampire Slayer. Gellar even 
contributed to early 2000s teen 
flicks in “I Know What You Did 
Last Summer” and probably 
peaked in cinema as Kathryn 
Marteuil in “Cruel Intentions.” 
But what happens when you 
put this prolific badass in 
the kitchen, and she writes a 
cookbook? Pure magic.

From a young age, I have 

been 
obsessed 
with 
“Buffy 

the 
Vampire 
Slayer.” 
The 

title heroine was everything 
I could’ve asked for: fierce, 
independent 
and, 
most 

importantly, human. The show 
doesn’t hide the fact that Buffy 
is a teenager — a teenager with 
very real problems. Now our 
heroine has a family, and her 
issues have evolved from the 
undead to the uncooked. As 
a mother, Gellar continues to 
slay recipes as well as she did 
vampires.

A 
slayer 
turned 
mother, 

Gellar has found the importance 
of family in cooking and sharing 
meals, 
putting 
together 
a 

collection of over 115 recipes 
titled “Stirring Up Fun with 
Food.” Gellar wrote in the 
introduction, “Mealtimes have 
always been when I ‘unplug’ 
for a bit and engage in real, 
honest connections. Once I had 
kids, this experience became 
even 
more 
important.” 
She 

sets the book in the context of 
involving her kids in cooking, 
using creative methods to make 
the process fun and inviting 
for them. In describing her 
creativity in the kitchen Gellar 
asks, “Isn’t it more fun to eat 
food out of a jar?” The answer 
is a resounding yes, for kids and 
pseudo-adults 
(college-aged 

people) alike.

To test out how college-

budget 
and 
kitchen-friendly 

her recipes were, I attempted 
the Truffle Parmesan Risotto 
and 
Asparagus 
Fries 
with 

fellow 
Buffy 
fanatics 
and 

editors Madeleine Gaudin and 
Carly Snider. This was my first 
undertaking of any type of 
risotto or baked vegetable — 
and possibly Carly’s first time 
in a kitchen — and the outcome 
was 
more 
than 
affordable, 

manageable and satisfactory.

Total prep and cook time 

was approximately 45 minutes, 
which was perfectly reasonable 
for the busy college student. And 

the result was simply delicious. 
The 
asparagus 
fries 
were 

crunchy, tasty and guilt-free; 
the risotto turned out creamy 
and satisfactory and could’ve 
only been improved with the 
addition of some grilled chicken.

Better yet, the ingredients 

list wasn’t overly complicated. 
Having 
had 
most 
of 
the 

necessary ingredients, we only 
had to purchase the asparagus, 
rice, buttermilk and cheese. It 
also made a hefty portion of 
food, completely feeding four 
college students and leaving 
plenty as leftovers. The most 
important takeaway from our 
time in the kitchen is that kid-
friendly 
recipes 
also 
equal 

college-friendly 
recipes 
— 

apparently, our parents were 
right about us still being kids all 
along.

The book is cleverly sectioned 

into the months of the year, 
with recipes suited for seasonal 
tastes. The beginning of each 
section 
features 
a 
couple 

paragraphs about the month 
and Gellar’s personal culinary 
highlights that directly address 
the time of year. She writes 
that June is “time to loosen up, 
relax, kick off your shoes, and 
get a little sand between your 
toes. Eating outdoors is the 
rule rather than the exception, 
and every meal feels like a 
celebration 
of 
the 
season’s 

bounty.” She does a fantastic 
job contextualizing her recipes, 
adding a personal touch that 
goes a long way with motivating 
the reader to replicate her craft.

Even more exciting is her 

inclusion of “Star Wars Day” 
(May 4th) and Shark Week 
recipes 
in 
their 
respective 

months, 
making 
fun 
treats 

with 
creative 
presentations. 

Gellar notes that the recipes 
are personally connected to her 
family: “What other kids can say 
their mom and dad were voices 
in a ‘Star Wars’ series?” From 
Chewbacca-shaped cookies to 
“Shark Fin Parfaits,” Gellar’s 
creativity shines brightly in 
these subtle inclusions. She 
doesn’t stop there, including 
a section for school nights in 
her September chapter and 
the summer solstice in June, 
appealing to parents who might 
want fun culinary ideas for any 
holiday or time of the year.

By including a wide array of 

manageable recipes, Gellar has 
produced a cookbook not only 
appealing to actual kids, but also 
to college-aged kids on a budget. 
Equally as adept at slaying 
vampires as she is producing 
delicious meals in the kitchen, 
Gellar’s “Stirring Up Fun with 
Food” makes a fantastic addition 
to any home.

UNIVERSAL PICTURES

Still from Bridget Jone’s Diary

A look at food & chocolate in the most notable romantic comedies 

“What originally turned you 

on to cooking?”

“Fire.”
And 
so 
answered 
Chef 

Roger Urso, owner of the 
company Food and Logic, chef 
for multiple organizations on 
campus including fraternity 
Sigma Chi, where his kitchen 
is based, and Lamda Chi. And 
what’s more, he’ll cook for 
you. 
Banquets, 
luncheons, 

individual meals — Urso is the 
cook for hundreds of students 
across campus, and he’s only 
one man with a sous-chef.

“I used to wash dishes at 

Ernesto’s in Plymouth … you 
see (the cooks) hitting the 
shit with whiskey and wine 
and fire. I was like ‘I want to 
do that!’ So I spent my lunch 
hour, every day, learning how 
to cook.”

So he learned. At the age 

of 14, Urso started to cook. 
Pre-internet 
and 
pre-tidily 

packaged 
Tasty 
Facebook 

videos, 
Urso 
learned 
by 

watching and repeating. Years 
after that, he ended up in 
the hotel business, catering 
banquets and events. And after 
that, he ended up in Ann Arbor 
by way of a Craigslist ad.

Ten years later, after moving 

from one business to starting 
his own, Urso has cooked for 
countless 
fraternities 
and 

other organizations on campus, 
making 
name 
for 
himself 

because 
of 
his 
company’s 

defining tenets — affordability 
and efficiency.

“We’re 
about 
$40,000 

more reasonably priced than 
anywhere else on campus,” 
Urso said. “It’s about seventeen 
to eighteen hundred dollars per 
semester to eat at dining halls, 
and I’m seventeen thousand 
for two semesters. And you get 
scratch cooked food.”

Because after ten years, Urso 

has seen what other kitchens 
on 
campus 
offer 
and 
has 

decided what he can change. 
As a man dedicated to food and 
the communities he serves, he 
trades a little less money for a 
little more love. As he puts it: 
“We’re not greedy.”

The “we” he’s talking about 

is him and his sous-chef Eddie, 
who was chopping, cooking 
and moving chicken during 
my entire time in the kitchen, 
located at the back of Sigma 
Chi’s house on State Street. The 
lunch he was was preparing? 
Chicken and waffles, with fresh 
fruit — watermelon, cantaloupe, 
pineapple — on the side.

“We focus heavy on meat, 

and 
for 
vegetarians 
we’ll 

focus on ruffage, vegetables, 
fruits … we’ll always have a 
complex carbohydrate, nothing 
saturated in butters and fats, 

and we’ll always have lean 
proteins,” Urso added. “We 
always try to stay more towards 
not flour tortilla, but more 
corn.”

Urso is cognizant of dietary 

needs 
as 
well 
as 
varying 

diets. 
Gluten-free, 
dairy-

free, vegetarian, vegan — all 
considered, 
respected 
and 

taken care of by handy hot 
boxes. He doesn’t buy from 
massive companies or multi-
purpose facilities. He gets up 
every morning and makes trips 
to Meijer, Trader Joe’s, Whole 
Foods and Gordon, gets to the 
kitchen at eight, and leaves at 
six.

“We buy our food daily, 

and we don’t do trucks. I had 
someone deliver 700 pounds of 
bad chicken and it was frozen,” 
Urso said. “Any time you get 

that type of food in, you still 
have to look at it, you have to 
chop into it and smell it because 
could 
you 
imagine 
getting 

stuck with 700 pounds of bad 
chicken?”

But it goes further than that. 

When tending to dietary needs, 
it could be as simple as making 
pesto that substitutes sunflower 
seeds for nuts. And then even 
making sure the sunflower 
seeds weren’t processed in a 
facility that processes nuts, and 
so on, and so on.

Even then, healthy eating can 

go so far. In his drastically and 
noticeably cheaper meal plans 
for students, Urso offers two 
choices: organic or not. Most of 
the time, the answer is not.

“You give the house an option 

… do you want to go GMO, do you 
want everything to be organic, 
do you want your beef and your 
chicken grassfed, free-ranged?” 
Urso said. “Then you show 
them the price difference and 
none of them really want to go 
organic. It’s expensive.”

As a result, Urso focuses on 

the positives and the potential 
— the healthy eating that can 
emerge even when GMO’s are 
in play and grass-fed is traded 
for facility-fed, and the savings 
that can still occur in that 
compromise.

“It’s the parent’s money, and 

you have social budgets,” Urso 

said. “If we can save you 35 to 
40 thousands dollars in eight 
months, what can you do with 
that money?”

Urso’s 
ability 
to 
balance 

affordability and quality is 
valuable when it comes to cost-
cutting techniques. Although 
he loves Greek life, the people 
he cooks for and the vast 
community he’s created that 
stretches across campus, he 
repeatedly emphasizes the need 
to remain “separate,” but also 
in the know when it comes to 
money and finance security.

“We go through about five 

thousand pounds of meat a 
month. But you have to know 
how to buy it, and you have 
to buy it in bulk. So you have 
to have a good relationship 
with your treasurer, and you 
have to know that the money’s 
there, and when the money’s 
going to be running out,” Urso 
said. “We have to set the right 
expectations like ‘Hey for seven 
months you guys are going to 
eat like kings, and then we’re 
going to dip off in the last 
month.’”

Overall, the people he cooks 

for do eat like kings because 
despite being aware of dietary 
and health concerns, Urso isn’t 
ever limited in trying out dishes 
— as long as they’re not too out 
there. Russian, Korean, Italian, 
Greek 
to 
stuffed 
chicken 

parmesan 
and 
goat 
cheese 

mashed potatoes, nothing is 
a little too out there, except 
vegetable stir fry — the clients 
weren’t a fan.

All in all, Urso goes through 

about five thousand pounds of 
meat, one thousand eggs and 15 
pounds of coffee all in a month. 
And this isn’t a mere estimate 
— 
each 
summer 
break 
he 

spends running and planning. 
Running, so he can “workout, 
get healthy … when I come back 
I can get fat again and off we 
go.” Planning, because he can 
write eight months of menus 
during the summer; each meal 
needs to be planned down to 
the spice.

Urso said one word he would 

use to describe his kitchen is 
“efficient” but in comparison 
to other kitchens on campus, 
including 
dining 
halls, 
his 

stands 
out 
as 
more 
than 

efficient. They seem better, 
healthier. So I told him this.

“This is better eating than 

most of the University offers,” 
I said.

“Yeah because what causes 

cancer? Food,” Urso responded.

“Look at agriculture, right, 

how does it start? … Monsanto, 
they genetically modify seeds 
… they go to other plants that 
have natural pesticides and 
herbicides in them already and 
then they splice it and they take 
the DNA and they marry it with 
another seed,” Urso explained. 
“They grow a whole crop of 

DOMINIC POLSINELLI/THE MICHIGAN DAILY

Chef Roger Urso in his kitchen at Sigma Chi Fraternity
Chef Roger Urso brings 
flare to college kitchens

Allow me to the set the scene. 

Katz’s Deli is filled with diners 
enjoying their corned beef and 
pickles, sipping on Coca-Cola 
and discussing 80’s politics 
in heavy New York accents. 
The busy diner quiets down 
to an astonished hush as Meg 
Ryan’s Sally loudly re-enacts 
her bedroom noises for all to 
witness. Mouths drop, men 
smile, and that famous line 
is said with perfect comedic 
timing and delivery: “I’ll have 
what she’s having.” Thank you, 
Nora Ephron, thank you.

From “When Harry Met 

Sally” to “Bridget Jones” to 
“Pretty Woman” to “Clueless,” 
food plays a defining role in 
establishing the relationships 
between 
characters 
and 

creating a timeline from first-
date jitters to the breakup 
blues, from hot and heavy to 
sad and weepy, food can create 
romance and heartbreak in a 
film.

I am not talking about 

those 
food-centered 
rom-

coms 
(As 
in 
“Julie 
and 

Julia,” “Waitress” and “No 
Reservations”), I am talking 
about your run of the mill 
romantic comedy. The ones 
probably featuring Katherine 
Heigl 
or 
Julia 
Roberts, 

depending on the decade, and 
most likely Hugh Grant or 
a younger replacement. The 
same basic structure exists 
throughout these kind of films 
surrounding food: First it’s 
the cute coffee date, followed 
by their first dinner together 
at a fancy restaurant (French 
or Italian), then comes the 
happy, dating montage which 
includes eating pizza while 
walking down the sidewalk at 
night, playfully feeding each 

other cotton candy on the pier, 
seductively baking brownies, 
tossing popcorn at the movies, 
etc.

This montage is usually 

succeeded by the breakup 
scene, which can differ slightly 
based on the tone of the movie 
–– usually it has to do with 
another woman, a lie gone too 
far, or the female lead must 
choose between her success or 
her love life. The breakup scene 
invariably results in the post-
breakup scene in which the 
female character can be found 
helplessly binge-eating junk 
food on the couch watching 
a sappy movie surrounded by 
candy wrappers, tissues and 
empty 
wine 
bottles. 
After 

the post-breakup scene, the 
characters typically get back 
together and live happily ever 
after ... wedding cake anyone?

Think of “Lady and the 

Tramp,” where that spaghetti 
scene has inspired many brave 
couples to try pasta kisses all 
over the world. How about 
Elle Woods stuffing her face 
with chocolate in “Legally 
Blonde” after Warner breaks 
up with her, a pathetically 
honest reaction to a bad split? 
Look at the evident romance 
and sexual tension in “Pretty 
Woman” as Richard Gere offers 
Julia Roberts a strawberry 
with her champagne. Did you 
ever notice in “Clueless” how 
Alicia Silverstone’s Cher and 
Paul Rudd’s Josh flirted over 
carrot sticks and pretzels on 
the couch? Is it a coincidence 
that 
their 
transition 
from 

sorta-siblings to full on lovers 
is told through their snacking 
habits? I think not. All of these 
scenes provide the viewer 
with an incredible amount 
of insight into the state of 
the relationship. Whether a 
prelude to a steamy sex scene 
or a mascara covered pillow 

and takeout for one, food in 
rom-coms plays a more crucial 
role than you may think.

Post-breakup 
scenes 

in 
romantic 
comedies 
are 

notorious for their use of 
chocolate 
and 
ice 
cream 

to define the sad woman’s 
state of mind. Put aside the 
portrayal of women as weak 
and helpless after a man 
breaks up with them, that’s an 
entirely different article. Still, 
the female lead tends to turn 
to food in times of romantic 
uncertainty or hardship.

The queen of rom-coms 

herself, her majesty Bridget 
Jones 
said 
it 
best: 
“I’m 

enjoying a relationship with 
two men simultaneously. The 
first is called Ben, the other, 
Jerry.” Ice cream, chocolate, 
Doritos, Chinese food, and 
now I’m getting hungry. Junk 
food is always there for our 
lonely heroines even when men 
are not. After all, “If someone 
breaks your heart , punch 
them in the face , seriously 
punch them in the face and go 
get some ice cream.” Thank 
you, Frank Ocean, thank you.

Food 
is 
as 
crucial 
an 

element in romantic comedies 
as 
any 
Beach 
Boys 
song 

or 
promoting 
unrealistic 

expectations of love. Through 
food, we can better grasp 
the 
foundation 
on 
which 

the 
characters 
build 
their 

relationship. Friends do not 
share milkshakes, friends do 
not feed each other chocolate 
covered strawberries. There 
is 
something 
informative, 

and 
sometimes 
sensual, 

about 
the 
way 
we 
view 

food, especially within the 
framework of relationships. By 
looking at romantic comedies 
through a food lens, we can 
better understand the way 
relationships 
develop 
on 

screen.

Sigma Chi chef Roger Urso talks efficiency, affordability,

that … Every third stage, they 
treat the soil with roundup, 
then they plant the seed, and 
that seed can (now) resist the 
poison, so it starts to grow. 
Soon as it sprouts, they spray 
the field with roundup. Three 
months later, they spray it, with 
roundup. Twenty days later 
they spray it, with roundup. Ten 
days later they harvest it.”

“Then they take it and feed it 

to pigs and cows and chickens, 
and now where’s the poison, 
it’s in them,” Urso continued. 
“And then where’s the poison? 
You buy it at the store. And then 
where is it? It’s in your body.”

So 
how 
do 
you 
avoid 

consuming pesticides and other 

harmful, over-processed goods?

“You 
can’t,” 
Urso 
said. 

Despite 
doing 
his 
best 
to 

ensure the meals he serves are 
low in sodium and full of the 
appropriate nutrients, when it 
comes down to us, he can only 
do his best for the people he 
serves, as well as for his own 
health and family.

“It’s (the poison) not going 

anywhere; 
it’s 
never 
going 

anywhere.”

But that doesn’t stop him 

from trying his best. He has 
a monopoly on loyalty at the 
University; this can be plainly 
seen in the wall that decorates 
his storage closet in his kitchen. 
It is covered in selfies and 

snapshots of meals he has 
served and people he has met. 
After ten years he knows that 
if any other company were to 
come knocking on the houses he 
serves, promising better prices, 
better meals, that they would be 
sent away.

It’s because of this loyalty 

that he doesn’t knock on other 
people’s doors, he just waits 
for them to come to him. But 
that doesn’t mean Urso isn’t 
expanding: not physically, but 
digitally.

“We have 32 shows in edit 

right now,” Urso explained. 
“We have a cooking show that 
we’re going to let rip soon. It’s 
called ‘Let’s Fucking Cook.’”

Urso offers two 
choices: organic 
or not. Most of the 
time, the answer 

is not.

SARAH AGNONE/THE MICHIGAN DAILY

Literati’s Espresso Bar
A mixed review of my top 
three coffee shops in AA

Arts Writer Sarah Agnone travels around Ann Arbor recording 
the tastes and sounds of her favorite caffeine-crutch suppliers

On any college campus, 

coffee 
indisputably 
reigns 

supreme and the University 
of Michigan is no different. 
Students prioritize their time 
for it, walk into class late with 
it, use expensive Keurigs or 
stop at the many coffee shops 
around campus (anything to 
avoid the dining hall coffee). 
Some of us drink it habitually, 
purely utilizing the caffeine. 
Others look to enjoy it, or at 
least pretend to for Instagram. 
When we meet someone who 
claims not to drink it, we’re 
hugely surprised. So for those 
of us who make it no secret 
that we’re utterly and totally 
dependent on coffee, here’s a 
closer and quirkier than usual 
look at the most frequented 
coffee shops.

The 
Walk-In 
Pinterest 

Board: Lab Coffee Shop

The epitome of a hipster 

coffee shop. Snuggly placed 
right 
onto 
Liberty 
St., 
a 

stone’s throw from State. The 
shop features the classically 
huge 
pour 
over, 
pressed 

flower 
decorations, 
famous 

matcha, and a great selection 
of 
strangely 
flavored 
but 

delicious 
deserts. 
Colorful 

books about succulents sit 
underneath actual succulents. 
Trendy Chance the Rapper 
themed 
cards 
and 
knick 

knacks for sale line the back 
shelf 
while 
Frank 
Ocean 

plays in the background. The 

employees are, you guessed it, 
so hipster and repping every 
flannel Urban Outfitters ever 
sold. 

Depending on who’s there, 

it’s a laid back environment. 
But at peak hours of the day, 
it’s hectic and you won’t find 
seating or even a place to stand 
with any personal space. Being 
this crowded and popular, it’s a 
talkative place. Late afternoon 
sees fewer customers and a 
quieter space. Plus, the matcha 
is everything it’s praised to be, 
as are the sea-salt lattes.

As for that first date, it’s 

memorable and the look and 
menu already give more than 
enough to talk about.

The Pit Stop: Espresso 

Royale

Maybe it’s just my personal 

vendetta 
against 
them 
or 

maybe 
more 
than 
one 
of 

us shares the theory that 
Espresso Royale is really only 
loved for not being Starbucks 
and sits abrasively close to 
both ends of central campus. 
And maybe it was a Starbucks 
employee 
who 
convinced 

me of their coffee’s glaring 
shortcomings and the vendetta 
is really just my thought 
that not liking them the way 
everyone else does is such an 
original though. I can’t say I’m 
a huge fan of their coffee but 
it does the trick on Monday 
morning before an 8:30 a.m. 
Regardless, I had to pay an 
extra $0.80 for soy despite 
it being the 21st century in 
which no one orders real dairy 
anymore. On top of that, they 

clearly consulted no Pintrest 
boards and could really update 
the look.

But 
at 
the 
same 
time, 

Espresso doesn’t pretend to be 
anything it isn’t, and I have to 
give credit where it’s due. For 
the most part, people run in, 
grab their coffee and maybe a 
snack, and rush out. Very few 
stay and set up at their tables. 
Not to mention, they make the 
meanest zucchini bread that 
you’d never know was also 
vegan. No complaints about 
the pumpkin chocolate chip or 
banana bread either.

As for first date ability, 

they’re kind of great. In the 
basement of the South U 
location or the throngs of plush 
chairs at the State St. location, 
it’s not obvious you have no 
idea what to say to the guy who 
just paid for your almond milk 
vanilla latte extra vanilla since 
he paid when everyone else is 
talking, minding their own 
business, face-timing mom. 
It’s laid back and cozy.

COURTESY OF THE LAST WORD

Known for its unique drinks, The Last Word is hidden away on East Huron
Back to the ’20s: The Last 
Word a hidden town gem

Finding & trying the drinks and apps of our resident speakeasy

At the corner of Huron and 1st 

— where urban Ann Arbor begins 
to blend into suburbia — sits the 
large sign that spells out “LIVE” 
glaring over the street. Yet, just 
around the corner off of Huron 
Street, an indiscriminate door 
in the wall leads to the basement 
of this building, introducing a 
vastly unique atmosphere to the 
world of Ann Arbor’s bar scene. 
Parading 
as 
an 
unassuming, 

practically unmarked door on 
that quiet stretch of Huron, The 
Last Word really is the hidden 
gem of Ann Arbor. This little hole 
in the wall is one of the best kept 
secrets among the newly turned 
21-year-olds of the University’s 
undergraduate population.

A cursory google of the bar 

yields 
a 
website 
with 
little 

information 
other 
than 
its 

address, 
contact 
information 

and a slideshow of photos. Their 
Facebook page yields little more 
except for a slew of near-perfect 
ratings. 
It’s 
an 
experience 

reserved for those willing to make 
the trip to the hidden corner, but 
one well worth it. The speakeasy 
style bar is covered in dark wood, 
dim lighting and photographs 
of times past. The space itself is 
small and warm, pairing perfectly 
with the menu and atmosphere.

The 
Last 
Word 
is 
most 

comparable 
to 
the 
generally 

popular Mash. The similarities 
end 
with 
their 
basement 

settings, however, as The Last 
Word differentiates itself in its 
expansive alcoholic offerings and 
diverse menu. The drink menu 
is expansive — broken up into 
chapters based on type of alcohol 
and flavor. Cocktail highlights 
include “Boy Blue” and “The 
Heist,” both deliciously crafted 
and tastefully balanced. They’re 
a far-cry from everyone’s typical 
go-to fishbowls from Charley’s, 
albeit pricier in exchange for their 
quality.

The 
cocktail 
menu 
also 

contains an extensive list of 
whiskeys and bourbons, featuring 
one-ounce “tasting pours” and 
two-ounce 
“sipping” 
sizes, 

allowing customers to try smaller 
samples of the spirits without 
having to pay for a full-sized 
glass. The lists of dark liquor 

cater to every palate and wallet 
imaginable — including more 
common bourbons like Jim Beam 
to the elusive, elite Pappy Van 
Winkle.

The food menu is concise, but 

varied in comparison to a typical 
cocktail bar. Most items are 
clearly designed for sharing, such 
as the charcuterie and cheese 
boards. The fries — flavored with 
one of three types of seasonings 
— are crisp and well-portioned, 
served with an additional three 
dipping sauces giving them a 
diverse flavor palette for the price. 
The menu isn’t overwhelming; it 
acts as a humble addition to the 
impressive drink selection and 
friendly ambience.

Thursdays at The Last Word 

feature an incredible jazz band, 
raising the speakeasy feel to new 
levels beyond the other days of 
the week. The band is catchy and 
entertaining, setting the mood 
unlike any other establishment 
in the Ann Arbor area. The bar’s 
secrecy makes their performances 
feel special, entirely reserved for 
the patrons lucky enough to find 
a seat on a crowded Thursday 
night. No matter the night of the 
week or occasion, The Last Word 
is the perfect boozy getaway.

My life and home growing 
up with a chef as a father

My father’s mind is most 

alive in a kitchen. He can create 
the most thrilling and unique 
flavor from seemingly mundane 
ingredients or spices. Some 
may equate culinary talent to 
experience or education, but 
the way his hands dance with 
ingredients in the kitchen can 
only be attributed to a passion 
that has grown since he stood 
on his own tippy toes in his 
childhood home, watching his 
own father.

In many families, it is common 

that one parent normally takes 
the role of “cook,” and I assume 
that most people would consider 
either their father or mother 
a fairly talented cook when it 
comes to things like simple 
chicken dishes and casseroles. 
But, my father surpasses the 
cooking-to-feed-hungry-
children-casserole chef. Rather, 
he is the Leonardo Da Vinci 
of pasta sauces, the Mozart of 
culinary endeavors and the 
Monet of wood-oven pizza.

I grew up sitting at a high-

top table in the middle of a 
restaurant that was nearly 15 
years old the day I was born; it 
was a place I’d grow to know 
as home more than I know my 
own. My father is a restaurateur, 
and the first of what would 
eventually 
become 
three 

successful restaurants is the my 
favorite place in the world.

At eight years old I could name 

a dozen Italian pasta shapes 

and sauces. When matched 
perfectly, the two mingle in 
the most romantic way to make 
customers swoon. I could work a 
panini press like an expert, pair 
prosciutto and arugula with 
Jersey tomatoes on a pizza, and I 
knew that the secret to creating 
the best burger in the world was 
nestling a fried egg between the 
toasted ciabatta roll and patty.

My father teaches me life 

lessons 
through 
breakfast 

sandwiches; he educates me 
in ways unknown through the 
proper food and wine pairings. 
He hands my brothers and I 
advice through the knead of 
pizza 
dough 
and 
seasoning 

of fresh fish. I wouldn’t call 
the lessons of my childhood 
orthodox, but I wouldn’t trade 
for a dad who teaches me about 
sports or cars or math. All these 
seem too mundane for my dad, a 
person who never let me leave for 
school in the morning without 
eating a “Vic McMuffin” (family 
secret) and a coffee.

In between mouthfuls of 

caprese salad, leek and parmesan 
bruschetta, turkey chili and 
perfectly cooked medium rare 
steak, I learned how to give, 
how to share, how to love, how 
to please and how to listen. I 
never realized that during the 
moments I was sharing the 
kitchen with my father, trying 
his new creations or enjoying 
a meal at that old high-top 
table, I was being taught the 
most valuable lessons. Things 
I’ll carry with me anywhere 
I ever go, these homemade 
risotto stuffed tomato values 

are values you will not learn in 
a classroom. You will not learn 
them in a book. You will not 
learn them from a professor. But 
from watching the way a pair of 
hands can take raw ingredients 
and transform them into love.

My father does not cook to 

feed, or to eat or to just survive. 
He cooks to share and to unite. 
He cooks to laugh, to cry, to 
enjoy, to revel. He does not cook 
to live; he lives to cook. He has 
an infatuation, one I myself have 
adopted, with the way in which 
food serves such an important 
purpose; not for sustenance but 
for bringing people together, 
no matter how different, at one 
table, to share something.

As a child I was always taught 

that I must believe in something 
in this world, to make life worth 
it. My father’s religion is made 
up of worshipping parmesan 
cheese and fine red wine; it 
is praying to the gods of pork 
chops and red peppers; it is 
the expression on the face of a 
person who has had a bad day 
and is immediately lifted with 
one bite of gnocchi. He has 
taught me to believe strongly 
in the power of tomatoes, in 
the power of a dinner table, in 
the power of creativity in the 
kitchen.

My father’s mind is most alive 

in the kitchen, in the dance of 
rosemary and olive oil, in good 
focaccia, in a full stomach. Seeing 
as the lessons I have learned 
from him are as irreplaceable as 
my grandfather’s base recipe for 
tomato sauce, I wouldn’t have it 
any other way.

6B — Thursday, April 6, 2017
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

When the “Rick & Morty” 

surprise episode that dropped 
last Saturday gave nod to a 
long lost Szechuan McNugget 
dipping sauce, the internet 
blew up and “Binging with 
Babish” was on the case to 
try to recreate the mysterious 
sauce.

Andrew Rea, the man behind 

the hit YouTube channel has 
carved out his own little corner 
of the web cooking famous 
dishes from movies and TV 
shows. From the burgers of 
“Bob’s Burgers” to the prison 
sauce from “Goodfellas,” he’s 
cooking his way through the 
screen canon.

“Since before movie theater 

snacks were a thing, people 
were sneaking Baby Ruths 
into movie theaters back in 
the ’20s,” Rea said. “You can’t 
go see a movie in a theater 
without a box of popcorn or 
sneaking in some goobers in 
your jacket.”

Although his mother taught 

him how to cook at a young age, 
Rea’s background is really in 
film. He didn’t go to culinary 
school, but his love of movies 
and television — fostered while 
at film school — led him to 
food.

“I’ve always loved television 

and movies and TV and movies 
always seem to love food,” Rea 
said.

He started doing the show 

accidentally. After investing 
in a camera and light kit, he 
found he had the perfect set up 
for a cooking show and decided 
to give it a go.

“I had just seen an episode 

of ‘Parks & Rec’ where Chris 
and Ron had a burger cook-

off, and Chris’s burger was 
this list of bullshit foodie 
buzzwords,” Rea said. “And I 
was like ‘Would that actually 
taste good?’”

In the episode, Chris cooks 

a turkey burger with a papaya 
chutney, 
taleggio 
cheese 

crisp, micro greens and black 
truffle aioli all on a gluten-free 
brioche bun. So, yeah, basically 
a mess of trendy, pseudo-
healthy food. Ron deftly beats 
him with a beef burger on a 
classic, white bun. In his video, 
Rea cooks both, and he comes 
to a similar conclusion. The 
beef burger wins, but Chris’s 
burger does taste as delicious 
as Beyoncé smells.

“I had to take some creative 

liberties,” 
Rea 
said. 
“Like 

taleggio, that’s an example of 
where I know the writers were 
just fucking around because 
taleggio is a soft cheese and 
there’s no way you can make a 
crisp out of it, it’ll just bleed oil 
and turn into a mess, I tried.“

Instead, Rea blends Fontina 

and Parmesan to create a 
similar funky taste to the 
taleggio, but with a harder 
cheese. 
Rea 
does 
pretty 

thorough research for most of 
his dishes, synthesizing parts 
from various recipes to create 
something he thinks to be most 
true to the source material.

“For ‘Inglorious Bastards’ 

’s strudel I was looking at the 
oldest, Austrian / Viennese 
strudel recipes I could get my 
hands on to try to recreate 
something that would have 
been of that era,” Rea said.

Beyond 
historical 
and 

textual 
accuracy, 
Rea’s 

signature is to make as much 
from scratch as possible, even 
when it’s not necessary. He 
grinds his own beef, makes 
his own pasta and even made a 

whole Thanksgiving dinner for 
the “Friends” episode.

“There wasn’t really any 

need for me to make an entire 
Thanksgiving meal and make 
every element as good as I 
possibly 
could,” 
Rea 
said. 

“They like it when I’m a little 
over the top I think.”

YouTube 
is 
the 
perfect 

platform 
for 
that 
sort 
of 

over-the-top 
content. 
With 

hundreds 
of 
super 
quick 

Tasty 
and 
Tasty-spinoff 

videos 
spamming 
newfeeds 

and timelines everyday, the 
internet seemed to be the right 
way to break into the food 
entertainment world.

“YouTube 
and 
Internet 

cooking videos in general are 
the way of the future,” Rea 
said. “This is a generation that 
likes 
compact, 
information 

rich entertaining.”

Rea was inspired by fast, 

aesthetically pleasing style of 
Tasty videos, but wanted to 
make videos for people who 
were more serious about cook.

“Let’s do this same thing 

where 
it’s 
like 
a 
nonstop 

barrage of information, food 
porn and let’s throw a little 
entertainment 
in 
there 
as 

well,” Rea said, “That’s what I 
think people are after.”

The match Rea has made — 

that of food and film — seems 
to be one made in heaven, 
and Rea hopes to develop the 
channel into a fulltime career.

“I have a lot of ideas for 

verticals 
and 
spin 
offs, 

different little show concepts 
that I want to explore and as 
soon as I’m able to make this 
my full time job,” Rea said. 
“Which I hope will be pretty 
soon.” 

In the meantime, he’s going 

to keep binging on, well, 
everything.

Reflecting on MF Doom’s 
nonsensical ‘Mm.. Food’

Food has become a focal point 

of sorts for today’s hip hop elite. 
Action Bronson styles himself 
as much a rapper as he does a 
culinary raconteur. Rick Ross 
found himself on the forefront 
of memedom thanks to his love 
for pears. Hell, Drake has his 
own brand of whiskey. It isn’t 
that good, mind you, but it 
exists, and that’s what matters. 
That all being said, food’s 
newfound hip hop limelight, 
while bombastic, is the result of 
years of rap’s old guard’s lyrical 
love for food finally bubbling 
over into present day — and 
what emcee to best illustrate 
one of the many virtues of the 
genre’s relationship with food 
than the erratic and enigmatic 
MF Doom?

MF Doom is likely one of 

hip hop’s most inadvertently 
versatile emcees. After releasing 
six different albums in a 10 year 
period, one would think that 
listening to his discography 
could afford them a fairly solid 
understanding of Doom’s ways. 
It isn’t a terribly hokey idea — the 
same could largely be said for a 
variety of other rappers who 
have been around longer than 
Doom, but fail to boast as large 
of a discography as he does. Yet, 
if you attempt to compare any 
one of his works against another, 
you’re likely quick to realize 
Doom’s 
unhealthy 
penchant 

for 
throwing 
his 
listeners 

absurd, 
aural 
curveballs. 

Boisterous production is often 
nestled against lyrics that are 
simultaneously 
nonsensical 

and bizarrely genius — lyrics 
that Doom threads together 
so cohesively that they have 
a near percussive quality to 
them. 
Those 
features 
are 

fundamental to Doom’s style, 
but his application varies across 
a dauntingly large spectrum — 
but I digress. This isn’t a lesson 
in Doom’s discography by any 
means, but it is important to 
understand the foundation of 
the man’s crazed style before 
taking a gander at a more 
relevant example of his artistry, 
in 
this 
case, 
his 
blatantly 

culinarily-grounded caricature 
of an album, Mm.. Food.

Just as its name suggests, the 

record’s subject matter primarily 
relies on food and references 
to it. The masked enigma we 
know and love finds himself 
rapping about beer, snacks and 
gluttonous desserts 
over 
and 
over 

again. It’s absurd, 
absolutely. It’s also 
slightly gimmicky, 
undoubtedly. 
But 

the 
fact 
that 
it 

works so well in 
spite of those facts 
is a testament to the enduring 
style that Doom so often touts. 
A fan of double and triple 
entendres, his use of references 
to food often becomes a medium 
for laudable insults (grounded in 
his trademark clever wordplay) 
to other hip hop contemporaries 
— a skit on “Gumbo” memorable 
mentions “Not perfect for every 
situation but edible (w)rappers 
could actually beef up your next 
meal,” illustrative of the kind 
of brute braggadocio layered 
within his songs.

That being said, as much 

as his lyrics gattle and his 
production bounces, his songs 
tread absurdist waters too — but 
that’s not to say it’s a terribly 
negative mark against Doom or 
the album, either. Oftentimes, on 
Mm.. Food listeners find Doom 
exchanging lyrical cohesion for 
aural excellence, touting his 
bread and butter of memorable 

one-liners juxtaposed against 
kitschy, unconventional beats 
— something his few guests 
have a knack for doing as well. 
The yet-to-be-unmasked Mr. 
Fantastik holds the title of one 
of the most memorable lines 
on Mm.. Food, spitting “True 
to the ski mask New York’s my 
origin / Play a fake gangsta like 
an old accordion” on the album’s 
magnum opus, “Rapp Snitch 
Knishes.” Isolated, many of Mm.. 
Food’s lines don’t seem terribly 
noteworthy, but in the context 
of the album’s instrumentation 
and emotions, they come off as 
masterfully constructed.

Why Doom grounds this 

album so deeply 
in food remains 
as much of a 
mystery as the 
man himself. One 
interpretation 
is 
that 
when 

listening to Mm.. 
Food, Doom’s use 

of food anchors his artistry in a 
way that allows him to construct 
one of the genre’s more creative 
and (laudably) absurd works. 
His lyrics are vehicles to a 
simple, singular message — 
Doom is one of the genre’s best, 
and he’s well aware of that 
fact. He hammers that message 
home by slapping together an 
unnecessary backdrop grounded 
in food purely to create an 
album that’s humorously over-
the-top, 
and 
unwaveringly 

(and 
unapologetically) 
self-

aggrandizing to boot. Who else 
would do that but the very best? 
That was probably a rhetorical 
question he’s asked himself 
multiple 
times 
over 
when 

putting together the record. Just 
like he notes on the album, “It’s 
about the beats / Not about the 
streets and who food he about 
to eat.”

Basement Arts confronts 
unspoken female violence

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

Recent play “Dear” questions nature of violence in womanhood 

Set in a communal bathroom 

of a college dorm, the play 
“Dear” follows four women’s 
encounter with violence and 
how it affects their lives and 
their womanhood.

“It’s really interesting to 

see how verbal and physical 
violence affects these three 
women,” said Elle Smith, an 
SMTD junior and director of 
the show. “We simultaneously 
hear 
these 
stories 
of 
the 

atrocities 
committed 
by 

other women who have been 
sentenced to jail for their 
crimes.”

The play considers how 

the acts of violence by female 
killers connect to the day-
to-day circumstances college 
students face. Smith reflected 
on the parallel between what 
this play is exploring and how 
audiences can relate to its 
themes.

Four 
women 
— 
April, 

Francie, Greta and Hazel — are 
the driving forces of the show.

“April 
is 
the 
character 

who 
we 
see 
through 
her 

monologues,” 
Smith 
said. 

“She is very pretty and very 
girly and she is undervalued 
because of that.”

April, 
played 
by 
SMTD 

freshman Christie Moyle, is a 
progressive character; during 
a two-week period and as time 
passes, the audience is able 

to witness how her character 
evolves.

“She 
ends 
her 
section 

very 
differently 

than she begins 
it,” 
Smith 
said. 

Additionally, 
Francie, 
played 

by SMTD senior 
Zoey Bond, poses 
a 
contrast 
in 

personality, which 
allows the play to 
move through a 
series of different 
character 
dynamics 
and 

interactions.

“Francie is sort 

of the ‘Regina George’ type 
character and as we get to see 
more about her, we realize 

BAILEY KADIAN

Daily Arts Writer

that 
she 
is 
actually 
quite 

vulnerable,” Smith added. The 
other two characters are Hazel 
and Greta, the best friends of 
April and Francie. 

“Hazel and Greta are the 

two sidekick type characters. 
Greta (played by SMTD junior 
Savanna Crosby) is Francie’s 
best friend and she is constantly 
looking for validation with 
her friendships with other 

women,” 
Smith 

said. “She [Greta] 
loves to write and 
is more sensitive, 
but 
when 
she 

is 
aligned 
with 

Francie—she 
can 

bite.”

Meanwhile, 

Greta’s 
counterpart 
Hazel, played by 
SMTD sophomore 
Megumi 
Nakamura, 
is 

April’s 
best 

friend and “we see her as 
she is reacting to the loss of 
her friend, but she’s not as 

victimized as she appears to 
be.”

Smith 
admits 
that 
the 

casting process was difficult 
because there were so many 
women who brought different 
elements to these roles.

“We had nearly fifteen girls 

audition and it was incredible 
to see so many young women 
interested 
in 
this 
play,” 

Smith said. “They all brought 
something very unique to the 
table and it was definitely the 
most difficult thing I have ever 
had to cast.”

The play explores violent 

acts as the central idea, while 
thinking about other ideas of 
womanhood, of men and the 
power of unity.

“We are looking at how else 

violence is expressed, if not 
physically. 
Thinking 
about 

these three women, what does 
it mean when we are fighting 
with each other? And not 
standing 
together?” 
Smith 

asked.

“Dear” also abandons male 

roles when considering acts of 

violence. The appearance of 
men or discussion about them 
is a rare occurrence in this play.

“There 
are 
few 
men 

mentioned in the play, and 
when they are, it a strategic 
mention of who they are and 
the role these men play in 
these women’s lives,” Smith 
discussed.

Lily Houghton, the show’s 

writer, gives a lot of flexibility 
to the cast as they learn what 
works and what doesn’t in 
transitioning the piece from 
script to stage.

“That’s part of the fun of 

working with a new work—
something that may read really 
well doesn’t translate to the 
stage, but it was really fine in a 
read-through,” Smith said.

This play aims to unite 

and encourage women, while 
illuminating important themes 
in all of our lives, and, Smith 
said, “It is important (that) 
women come to see this show 
to realize that we are stronger 
together, rather than fighting 
apart.”
