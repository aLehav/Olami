Thursday 
marked 

undocumented 
immigrants’ 

last day to submit renewals 
to 
the 
Deferred 
Action 
for 

Childhood 
Arrivals 
program 

— but undocumented students 
at the University of Michigan 
were undeterred. One hundred 
protesters marched from the Diag 
to the Fleming Administration 
Building 
to 
lobby 
University 

officials for institutional resources 
and protection for vulnerable 
students.

After President Donald Trump’s 

successive travel ban orders in 
January, and again after the repeal 
of DACA in September, University 

President Mark Schlissel stated 
the University will not disclose 
students’ immigration statuses 
voluntarily. Schlissel also formed 
an Immigration Working Group 
to monitor and analyze gaps in 
resources.

Thursday’s 
rally, 
organized 

by the Student Community of 
Progressive 
Empowerment, 

centered around four new requests 
of 
the 
administration: 
fully 

meeting financial need, extending 
guidelines 
to 
obtain 
in-state 

tuition, appointing a central staff 
liaison between undocumented 
students 
and 
the 
University 

and improving accessibility for 
prospective students.

In 
October 
2016, 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

launched its five-year Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion plan — an 
extensive initiative designed 
to promote a more diverse 
and inclusive campus through 
increasing 
staff 
diversity, 

retention of underprivileged 
students and the assurance 
of equal compensation for all 
races, genders and identities.

The overall plan comprises 

49 
unit 
plans 
created 
by 

all 
schools, 
colleges 
and 

departments at the University. 
Two student panels, consisting 
of 
25 
undergraduate 
and 

graduate 
students 
each, 

convene every month to discuss 
new strategies and ideas with 
DEI leaders.

Though the plan was created 

to foster both long- and short-
term change on campus, the 
first year of DEI has left many 
on campus eager for more 
immediate 
action. 
Replete 

with racist incidents — ranging 
from posters promoting white 
supremacy 
to 
racial 
slurs 

written on students’ dorm 
room doors — the past year 
has weighed heavily upon both 
administrators and minority 
students.

Diversity Peer Educators

As part of the DEI plan, 

student 
diversity 
peer 

educators 
strive 
to 
create 

a 
community 
inclusive 
of 

all 
identities 
by 
hosting 

educational 
events, 
serving 

as 
social 
justice 
educators 

and advising their specific 
community’s 
multicultural 

council.

LSA senior Jad Elharake, 

a diversity peer educator for 
West Quad Residence Hall, 
has been working over the past 
nine months to add Middle 

Eastern/North 
African 
as 

an ethnicity option on all 
official University documents. 
In an email interview, he 
expressed disappointment in 
the University for dealing with 
race issues through traditional 
identity binaries, especially in 
the historical context of the 
Arab communities’ presence 
on campus.

“I know that historically 

when 
efforts 
(target) 
this 

same issue, our needs are not 
prioritized 
and 
commonly 

fall victim to binary views 
of 
race 
and 
identity,” 
he 

wrote. “Lack of institutional 
memory, 
documentation, 

and 
recognition 
regarding 

the past mobilization of our 
community and our historical 
presence 
on 
campus 
only 

further the severity of the 
issue and disempower the Arab 

The Ann Arbor Downtown 

Development Authority approved 
$150,000 to install chain-link 
fences 
around 
city-owned 

parking lots at an executive 
committee meeting Wednesday.

The decision came after a 

string of fatal incidents in the 
city. On Monday, a 56-year-
old man fell from the parking 
structure at the intersection of 
Fourth and Williams streets. 
A 22-year-old man fell from 
the same parking lot on Sept. 7 
and a teenage girl fell from the 
structure on the intersection of 
State and Washington streets last 
year.

DDA Director Susan Pollay 

explained the rooftop of the 
Fourth and Williams streets 
structure will be the priority, 
followed by the Ann and Ashley 
streets structure, the Fourth and 
Washington streets structure, 
the 
Maynard 
structure, 
the 

Liberty Square structure and the 
Forest Avenue structure.

“(Fourth and Williams is) the 

first one we’re tackling because 
it’s the biggest … geographically,”

Why I kneel: A conversation with 
MPH student, activist Dana Greene

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

Public Health graduate student Dana Greene is continuing kneeling protests to shed light on racism at the University.

CAMPUS LIFE

Approximately 100 protesters gathered 
to lobby the University for more resources

RIYAH BASHA
Daily News Editor

Greene garnered national attention by kneeling for 21 hours in protest in the Diag

Public Health student Dana 

Greene knelt at the block ‘M’ on 
the Diag for 21 hours.

It was not a cool fall day, 

either — the sun bore down on 
University of Michigan students 

at a peak 91 degrees.

Greene, along with dozens of 

other students, gathered at the 
Diag to kneel in protest of racism 
across the country, mirroring 
former 
NFL 
player 
Colin 

Kaepernick’s own kneel last year 
that lost him his job. Food, water 
and drinks were shared, and a 
tent was later set up.

People 
of 
all 
varying 

backgrounds unified together, 
Greene said, in a way that was 
surreal to him.

For the Michigan vs. Michigan 

State game Saturday — a rare 
night 
game 
nonetheless 
— 

Greene has plans.

In hopes of keeping the spirit 

of last Monday alive, Greene 

and his team are calling upon 
students, faculty and Michigan 
fans to kneel and sit during 
national anthem.

A letter written by Greene 

circulated this week explaining 
his message.

“I am no longer looking to 

administration to take a stand

Students see profits by flipping 
season football tickets on Facebook

Many students have used online class pages to resell their tickets to key games

University of Michigan class 

Facebook 
pages, 
meant 
for 

academic inquiries, awkward 
freshman year introductions 
and 
wholesome 
memes 
are 

now a front for student football 
ticket sales.

MarketNoire, 
an 
open 

Facebook group with the sole 
purpose of serving as a space for 
transactions between students, 
has close to 7,000 members and 
is a frequent stop for students 
trying to buy or sell their 
football tickets.

Pharmacy student Kimberly 

Pais said she’s sold numerous 
tickets 
this 
year 
using 

MarketNoire 
and 
Facebook 

class pages.

“I’ve been doing it for a 

while,” Pais said. “For the 
most part, I get blasted with 
messages right away.”

Pais has been selling since 

her 
undergraduate 
years, 

which were also spent at the 
University.

“I’m basically just trying to 

make my money back,” she said. 
“I try and sell it around the 
average value. If I really want to 
sell it, I’ll sell it for a little under 
just so I can get rid of it.”

On the other end of the 

spectrum is LSA sophomore 
Matthew 
Askar, 
who 
only 

recently 
started 
flipping 

football tickets for a profit.

“When I originally sold my 

first (Ohio State) ticket, I kept 
getting messages from people 
offering me different prices 
and I realized I could’ve gotten 
a lot more,” Askar said. “So I 
messaged other people asking 

how much they were selling 
their tickets for and realized 
there was a gap, so I started 
trying to flip tickets.”

Askar has bought about 10 

tickets and has flipped four of 
them for a profit.

“At first I felt bad, but then 

I realized that if you’re not 
willing to do the research — and 
I am taking the time to look it 
up and message people — it kind 
of evens out,” he said.

His greatest profit margin 

thus far has been $150.

“You feel some achievement 

when you flip a ticket,” he said. 
“It feels like I’m doing some shit 
with my life.”

Askar 
also 
conducts 
his 

business using MarketNoire, 
and already has plans for the 
future.

“Next 
year, 
probably 
not 

(going to try) because we don’t 
have the big games,” he said. 
“But for sure senior year, I can 
capitalize on that.” 

Both 
Pais 
and 
Askar 

recognize 
some 
seasons 

can produce more valuable 
tickets than others. This year, 
with both the Ohio State 
and Michigan State games at 
the Big House, University of 
Michigan ticket holders are 
selling without any problems.

“I was trying to sell my OSU 

ticket and like five seconds 
later some girl messaged me 
and I sold it,” Pais said.

Associate Athletic Director 

Kurt Svoboda wrote in an 
email interview that 21,000 
tickets were sold this year, 
the highest demand for tickets 
since 23,584 student tickets 
were purchased in the 2007 
season.

In 
regards 
to 
students 

reselling their student tickets, 
Svoboda commented, “We love 
it when our venues are full 
because it adds so positively to 
our atmosphere. In that regard, 
I’d much rather have a ticket 
utilized than to go unused.”

Every Friday, the Michigan Daily will 
be republishing an article from the 
Daily’s archives from a moment in 
University history. 

December 4, 1989 
— Some fans 

perform salt rituals. Others repeatedly 
wear the same socks, jerseys and 
boxers shorts. For die-hard fans of the 
maize and blue, these superstitions are 
a force that helped carry the football 
team all the way to the Rose Bowl. 
SA first-year student Dylan Brock 
said his green-and-black plaid boxer 
shorts and his blue down comforter 
propelled the team to Pasadena.

His superstition evolved over this 

year’s winning season. “I always 
sleep in until the game on gameday 
Saturday mornings,” Brock said. “I 
would never get changed until after 
the game was over. So I would wear 
my boxers and then wrap myself in my 
dark blue comforter. My friend would 
come over to watch the games, and we 
kept winning.”

The whole thing started as a joke, 

Brock said. But after securing his first 
game ticket of the year, Brock showed 
up at Michigan Stadium for the Ohio 
State game clad in his trusty box- and 
armed with his familiar comforter.

After the Wolverines disposed 

of the Buckeyes, Brock ditched the 
comforter for a joyful jaunt around the 
field in just his boxer shorts. 

“When we blew out Penn State, 

I kept saying it was because of my 
comforter,” Brock said. “Then my 
friends convinced me that it was true, 
and I guess I convinced myself.” 

The true test was the Wisconsin 

game, Brock said.

“I ordered pizza and when the 

pizza guy came I had to get dressed to 
go get my pizza,” Brock said. “When 
I got dressed and went downstairs, 
Wisconsin scored a touchdown. That’s 
when I realized that there was a direct 
correlation between the two. I came 
back and got undressed. We won the 
game, but we didn’t blow them out.” 

LSA junior David Lanxner said his 

elaborate salt ritual has brought the 
maize and blue to the Rose Bowl.

“I don’t know how it got started,” 

Lanxner said. “I started doing it this 
year before every football game. 
Before the games I would pour salt 
around the stadium and our house.” 

The ritual traditionally is 

performed around someone’s feet, 
room or bed to bring them good luck, 
Lanxner said.

“My family is really superstitious,” 

Lanxner said. “I watched this 
Middle Eastern movie when I was 
little, where this little boy kept 
having nightmares. The little boy’s 
grandmother poured salt around 
the boy’s bed and put a knife in the 
mattress to get rid of bad spirits. I 
guess I kind of picked up on that.”

University alumnus Mark Grueber 

said he and his former first-year 
roommate Dave Gamm are the proud

owners of a giant letter “D” and a 

cardboard picket fence that they use to 
show support for the team’s defensive 
abilities. 

“We have had the D-fence for two 

years,” Grueber said. “The first time 
we used it was the Ohio-Michigan 
game two years ago. They won that 
game, 31-23.”

Grueber said that because he and 

Gamm were unaware of the power 
of the D-fence, they didn’t use it at all 
last year.

“We brought it to every game this 

year,” Grueber said. 

Since Grueber and Gamm live apart 

from one another, they only use the 
special weapon when they watch the 
game together.

“It’s the two of us that make the 

force. I am the fence and Dave is 
the D,” Gruebber said. “Combined 
knowledge is more powerful. We’re 
sick.”

Other requirements for Grueber 

and Gamm are wearing the same 
clothes to every game. 

“We must also enter the same gate 

and leave at the same time - that is 
essential,’ Grueber said.

For Brock, his revealing ensemble 

proved a little hazardous after the 
Ohio State game.

“I wore just my special boxers and 

my comforter into the stadium,” Brock 
said. “I was extremely jubilant that we

won. I ran onto the field in just my 

boxers, running around and hugging 
all my friends. When I tried to leave 
through the endzone, I got kind of 
thrown around by the cops. It got 
kinda rough, but it was definitely an 
interesting experience.”

For his part, Lanxner even poured 

a circle of salt around Michigan 
Stadium the day of the Ohio State 
game. “I think I might even use this 
for finals,” Lanxner said.

JOHN YAEGER/Daily

Brothers of the Theta Xi fraternity participate in the annual Defend 
The Diag to protect the Diag and raise awareness for Multiple 
Sclerosis Wednesday.

DE FE ND THE DIAG

Pollay said. “Some of the garages 
(students) may be familiar with, 
like Maynard … much of the 
rooftop 
already 
has 
fencing, 

so that won’t take very long to 
complete. And Forest has a unique 
design … so it’s harder to look over 
the edges.”

Pollay estimated the entire 

construction 
will 
take 
three 

months. 
In 
the 
meantime, 

Republic Parking, the entity that 
operates the garages on behalf of 
the city, will add additional staff 
members to monitor rooftops. The 
DDA also allocated an additional 
$250,000 for this staffing and any 
further fencing needs, though 
Pollay said she was still unsure 
exactly how much security will 
cost at the moment.

“We’ll start collecting those 

costs once we have an estimate 
from (Republic Parking); we don’t 
have that yet,” Pollay said. “That’s 
why the project budget is larger 
than the proposal for the fencing 
to allow for a lot of latitude for the 
cost of staffing.”

Though plans to install fences 

on garage rooftops have been in 
the works in Ann Arbor since 
last year, high costs delayed 
the project. City Administrator 
Howard Lazarus said the initial 
bid for permanent fencing would 
have cost Ann Arbor $1 million. 
Though the DDA is still looking 
for permanent fencing, it decided 
to install the chain-link fencing as 
an interim measure.

“The DDA went out for a bid 

on a permanent installation, and 
the price they got back was far in 
excess of what they budgeted,” 
Lazarus said. “They chose to 

reject the bids and then tried to 
rebid it. The difference now is that 
they are looking at a very small-
opening chain-link fence, which 
is an interim solution, not the 
decorative fencing that they have 
initially designed and picked.”

City 
Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski, D-Ward 5, added 
that not only were costs higher, 
but there was also a lack of 
fencing contractors due to massive 
amounts of construction in the 
region.

“It was a much higher cost and 

lower response from the fencing 
companies than we expected,” 
Warpehoski said. “And the reason, 
we’ve heard, is the building of 
Little Caesar’s Arena … with that 
project, all the workforce for 
projects like these in Southeast 
Michigan already had their hands 
full.”

Some of the falls were ruled 

suicides; research shows installing 
physical structures like these 
chain-link fences can help in 
preventing impulsive action.

In 
an 
email, 
Todd 
Sevig, 

Counseling 
and 
Psychological 

Services director, wrote CAPS 
aims to strengthen ties both 
within and outside the University 
of Michigan, a kind of multi-
dimensional support that is crucial 
to ensure no one falls through the 
net.

“We 
at 
CAPS 
are 
always 

looking to strengthen our work 
around student mental health — 
our focus of the last few years has 
been to devote time, attention, 
and resources to cutting edge 
clinical and outreach tools for 
suicide prevention,” Sevig wrote. 
“Improving mental health really 
does take all of us, working 
together, in our different roles, to 
change the story.”

sign their name in support and 
enroll as a member of Faculty 
for Justice. As of Thursday 
afternoon, the petition gathered 
nearly 400 signatures.

The three faculty members 

behind 
the 
letter, 
associate 

Philosophy 
professor 
Meena 

Krishnamurthy, 
associate 

History 
professor 
Amanda 

Armstrong-Price and Antoine 
Traisnel, 
an 
associate 

Comparative 
Literature 

professor, led the creation of the 
group and Thursday’s picketing 
across their departments.

Armstrong said it was equally 

important to raise awareness 
about 
C.C. 
Little, 
support 

student activism and stand in 
solidarity with student actions 
and concerns.

“We 
came 
together 
with 

some other faculty members 
because we felt that there 
should be more of a concerted 
response and show of solidarity 
on campus towards students 
organizing against racism on 
campus,” Armstrong said.

The 
picketing 
was 
an 

important first step for Faculty 
for Justice.

“Among 
our 
faculty 
and 

colleagues there is a demand for 
having a more concerted effort 
for supporting students who 
protest and act against racism 
and white supremacy,” Traisnel 

said. “We felt that often we left 
our departments to be in charge 
of writing statements and we 
didn’t know how to respond 
ourselves, so we decided to 
create this group, Faculty for 
Justice.”

“The goal is in many ways to 

let students take the lead and 
we want to act in solidarity with 
them,” Krishnamurthy said.

Education 
professor 
Debi 

Khasnabis joined the picketing, 
passing out flyers to students as 
they passed by. Khasnabis said 
she teaches her students about 
the importance of creating safe, 
inclusive environments for K-12 
students, and believes the same 
should be done for students at 
the University.

“I don’t think it’s right for 

our students to feel unsafe,” she 
said.

Some 
students 
passing 

through 
the 
faculty-lined 

walkway 
in 
the 
building 

continued walking, while others 
stopped to discuss the issue.

LSA 
freshman 
Vishal 

John was impressed by the 
involvement of the faculty and 
viewed their willingness to 
speak out as an encouraging 
response.

“Based off recent events that 

have been happening on campus 
I think it’s important to address 
these issues,” John said. “I think 
it’s good that they’re actually 
talking about these subjects 
instead of avoiding them or 
remaining silent.”

community.”

He further emphasized the 

importance of the University 
recognizing 
the 
ME/NA 

community in connection with 
achieving the goals delineated 
within the DEI plan.

“For the University, the ability 

to ascertain who identifies with 
the ME/NA community is a 
necessary step in developing 
programs and interventions to 
address any disparities and to 
achieve the DEI goals,” he wrote. 
“Knowing that we live in a state 
with the largest concentration of 
ME/NA individuals outside of the 
Middle East, we have a regional 
responsibility 
to 
implement 

the ME/NA racial category to 
support the large population of 
students.”

In 
a 
September 
interview 

with 
the 
Daily, 
Elharake 

expressed optimism regarding 
new University Provost Martin 
Philbert’s 
hire 
in 
terms 
of 

implementing 
DEI 
initiatives 

across campus. He also noted 
Philbert had been receptive of 
Elharake’s ideas in precursory 
meetings.

“I think it’s a critical time 

here for Michigan, especially 
politically, globally and I’m just 
looking forward to the role that 
he’s going to play for students 
on campus,” Elharake said in 
September. “He’s kind of the go-to 
person when it comes to (this 
ethnicity 
addition) 
especially 

with figuring out the logistics of 
it and in reality, us educating him 
on the Middle Eastern/North 
African student population here 
at Michigan.”

Professor diversity training

In the wake of the dozens of 

recent incidents of racism on 
campus, one initiative within 
DEI now of special importance 
is 
providing 
faculty 
with 

training that enables them to 
communicate and engage with 
students in a way that makes the 
classroom environment feel safer 
and more inclusive for minority 
students.

LSA Dean Andrew Martin 

said it was especially important 
to train faculty in fields that 
are not inherently conducive to 
conversations about race or social 
inclusion.

“One of the things that’s 

challenging, particularly given 
the pace of the events and the 
things that are happening, it 
might be a little bit easier to 
talk about some of these issues 
in a political science course or 
a history class or a course in 
American culture, but how do 
you talk to students about racial 
hatred in a physics class or a 
mathematics class?” Martin said.

The University already had 

some 
infrastructure 
at 
its 

disposal for faculty education, 
such as the Center for Research 
on Learning and Teaching, but 
it has also created several new 
diversity workshops on inclusive 
teaching 
and 
is 
providing 

additional support specifically 
for faculty teaching “Race and 
Ethnicity” courses.

Diversity training is required 

for certain subsects of the faculty, 
such as new graduate student 
instructors 
and 
new 
tenure-

track professors, as well as senior 
faculty who want to be on faculty 
hiring committees.

Fiona Lee, a professor of 

Psychology 
and 
LSA’s 
first 

associate dean of DEI, said she 
had personally experienced how 
serious the college was about 

mandated 
diversity 
training. 

Before she became associate 
dean, she was part of a faculty 
hiring committee from which 
Martin had excluded one of the 
most senior faculty members 
because they hadn’t attended a 
diversity workshop.

“I was very irritated with you, 

because this person’s expertise is 
integral to this hiring initiative, 
and we said, ‘How can we exclude 
this person from this committee 
when they are a person who 
really knows the most about the 
position?’ “ she said. “But Dean 
Martin says, ‘No means no.’ So 
there are strong expectations.”

The next year, Martin said, all 

professors participated. 

Between 
new 
faculty 
and 

faculty senior enough to be on 
hiring 
committees, 
however, 

there are many faculty not 
required to participate in any 
type 
of 
diversity 
workshop. 

Angela Dillard, LSA associate 
dean of undergraduate education, 
said that’s because they would 
rather 
incentivize 
faculty 
to 

participate of their own accord 
rather than forcing them, which 
could generate ill will.

According 
to 
Lee, 

approximately 
1,500 
faculty 

members participated in at least 
one such workshop last year, out 
of about 4,000 faculty total.

Diversifying faculty

The lack of faculty of color is 

another issue receiving particular 
scrutiny in the implementation 
of the DEI plan. From 2011 to 
2016, there was no change in the 
percentage of tenured faculty 
who 
were 
underrepresented 

minorities.

In an interview with The Daily 

in February, Tabbye Chavous, 
director 
of 
the 
University’s 

National Center for Institutional 
Diversity, said there would be a 
noticeable increase in faculty of 
color within the next year.

“This fall will likely have an 

appreciable difference on our 
faculty. This hiring initiative 
will change, within one year, the 
composition of the people who 
will be providing the educational 
experiences to our students,” 
Chavous said. “That’s just one 
example, but it’s an example of 
something that is pretty short-
term in terms of the outcomes of 
those efforts.”

As part of their Diversifying 

Academia 
program, 
LSA 
is 

funding 
several 
postdoctoral 

fellowships 
to 
attract 
young 

academics with demonstrated 
interest in and commitment to 
diversity, chief among them the 
LSA 
Collegiate 
Postdoctoral 

Fellowship Program.

“This is one of the things that’s 

really core to Fiona’s portfolio,” 
Martin said. “The LSA Collegiate 
Postdoctoral Fellowship Program 
is a program designed to help 
increase the diversity of our 
faculty. This is a program that 
will bring in 10 new faculty to our 
campus every year, so hopefully 
50 over the next five, and I have 
every expectation to believe that 
it will continue after that.”

In its first year, Lee said, the 

program received 762 applicants, 
hiring seven new faculty members 
out of that pool –– all of whom 
are underrepresented minorities. 
This year, they received 936 
applications, from which they 
will make up to 13 new hires.

While the fellowship does not 

put its fellows on a tenure track, 
the idea is that many of them 
eventually will get there, Martin 
said.

against 
these 
and

countless

acts 
of 

racists 
and 
xenophobic 

actions that have taken place 
on OUR campus and across

acts?”

The 
Michigan 
Daily 

sat down with Greene to 
hear about his experiences 
kneeling on the Diag, his 
thoughts on campus climate 
and his hopes for Saturday’s 
protest.

This interview was edited 

for length and clarity.

The 
Michigan 
Daily: 

What were your thoughts on 
campus climate before last 
Monday?

Greene: I thought it was 

terrible. It just really struck 
me because I just remember 
being a freshman here — it 
wasn’t that long ago. I had 
some negative experiences 
but nothing as avert and 
obvious — blatant racism — 
like incoming freshmen have 
to experience. I couldn’t 
imagine coming back to my 
dorm room as a freshman 
like two weeks, three weeks 
in and see racist slurs across 
my door.

I am trying to get my feet 

wet and figure out college 
life and who my friends are 
and what to study and, next 
I know, I am organizing a 
protest because somebody 
decided they wanted to 
call me derogatory racial 
slurs. And so, I remember 
thinking, 
“Well, 
these 

things are going to happen. 
Toughen 
it 
up, 
because 

that’s what I had to do.” 
Then I just remember, no — 
students shouldn’t have to 
do that. “Oh, I have to deal 
with students being racist 
to me or seeing racist flyers 
on campus or whatever” — 
no, people should be able 
to walk around campus in 
their own skin and be their 
authentic selves and not 
have to worry about that. 
But yet, we do. And that is 
just unacceptable.

I always hate to bring it 

back to this event but it is 
just like a fact — at least for 

me — that once President 
Trump came to the scene 
as not only a candidate, but 
as president, that’s when 
things started to change. 
I am not going to say what 
we thought no longer exists 
because we always knew 
(racism) was there. But it 
used to be unacceptable to 
do or say or act on. But now 
it has become acceptable.

Just a few weeks ago, 

Latino students who were 
just excited to be here 
painted the Rock with their 
culture and their names and 
next thing you know, there’s 
another set of racial slurs 
attacking Latino students 
with “Make America Great” 
attached to it. So essentially 
doing it in President Donald 
Trump’s name.

If I am a freshman or an 

undergraduate student or 
just anybody in general, how 
am I supposed to exist in 
this space, where not only 
do I feel like my own student 
body doesn’t support me, 
but then my country doesn’t 
support me? The President 
of United States basically 
sanctioned this behavior. 
He put the rubber stamp on 
this behavior. People can 
disagree with me on this or 
not — that’s their right to. 
But that is my belief.

TMD: 
What 
do 
you 

think 
the 
University 
— 

administration, 
teachers, 

students — are doing wrong 
in regards to campus climate 
and bias incidents?

Greene: For me, there 

isn’t any one policy or 
something 
that 
isn’t 
in 

the books that should be 
written there that is going 
to change what students 
on this campus, faculty, 
staff, etc., are feeling. For 
me, it’s bigger than that. 
It’s, what do we allow to 
happen? 
When 
you 
see 

racist flyers on campus, how 
many people walk past them 
without ripping them down? 
Or when you see somebody 
painted something racist on 
the Rock, how many people 
do not paint over? We allow 
these things to happen and 
that’s why they continue to 
come here.

O

ne day, I may forget my 
name. I will wake up 
in a stranger’s house 

and see a person I’ve never 
met before in the mirror. Her 
eyes will stare blankly back at 
me, face muscles sagging with 
fatigue and confusion. One 
day, I will forget how to hug 
someone. I will have to ask 
where the bathroom is in my 
own home, and I will need help 
getting there.

One day, my brain may 

simply forget how to breathe.

Every 66 seconds, someone 

in the United States develops 
Alzheimer’s disease. It is the 
sixth leading cause of death in 
the nation, and the only one in 
the top 10 that cannot be cured, 
prevented or slowed. If there 
is no cure in my lifetime, I may 
become one of its victims — if not 
me, then a loved one. Everyone 
with a brain is at risk; no matter 
how healthy your lifestyle or 
how active your brain, your 
own home may one day become 
a maze of once-familiar objects 
and hallways. Your loved ones 
will helplessly watch from the 
other side of the glass, your face 
unrecognizable as you slowly 
walk into the unknown.

I’ve 
worked 
at 
the 

Alzheimer’s Association for 
eight months now and have 
already 
heard 
a 
lifetime’s 

worth of stories from people 

affected by the disease. I’ve 
spoken with a woman who left 
school to become a full-time 
caregiver for her grandmother, 
who recently passed away 
after fighting Alzheimer’s for 
15 years. I’ve heard stories of 
husbands who have forgotten 
their 
wives’ 
names 
after 

50 years of marriage and 
countless families who have 
sacrificed 
their 
retirement 

savings to preserve the last 
few years they had with their 
loved one. Children have told 
me stories of how their parents 
have already forgotten them 
and I’ve read about brides 
who have rescheduled their 
weddings so that their parents 
could attend before it could be 
erased from their memories.

What gives me hope is 

knowing that as more people 
are affected by the disease, the 
world gains more advocates 

to fight against it. Right now, 
thousands of people across the 
country are participating in 
the Walk to End Alzheimer’s, 
“the world’s largest event to 
raise awareness and funds 
for Alzheimer’s care, support 
and research.” I urge you to 
join me on Sunday as I walk 
alongside them at Washtenaw 
Community College, bringing 
us steps closer to a world 
without Alzheimer’s. 

Though 
I 
know 
I 
may 

eventually 
become 
another 

victim of the disease, I may 
also be its first survivor. 
One day, the unfamiliar may 
become familiar once more, 
and the glass of my eyes may 
be cleared. I may be reunited 
with my loved ones without 
ever having to leave them.

I know that I am lucky to 

have not yet been touched by 
Alzheimer’s disease, though 
in a way I already have. In just 
eight months, the fear that I 
may lose myself within my own 
body has ignited a new passion. 
The stories I’ve heard have lit 
a purple flame within me that 
grows each day, lighting the 
way into the unknown, the 
future, where I know the first 
survivor will be waiting.

Walking to end Alzheimer’s

Federal Level Policy

In the wake of the largest 

mass 
shooting 
in 
recent 

U.S. history, Speaker of the 
House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky., will not talk 
about gun violence this week. 
Over at the White House, press 
secretary 
Sarah 
Huckabee-

Sanders has said, “It would be 
premature for us to discuss 
policy when we don’t fully 
know all the facts or what took 
place (Sunday night).” I have 
one question for our federal 
government: If not now, when?

This “thoughts and prayers” 

discourse followed by inaction 
is nothing new. In fact, since 
the shooting at Sandy Hook 
Elementary School in December 
2012, Congress has failed to do 
anything significant to stem 
the tide of gun violence in the 
United 
States. 
While 
other 

Western nations have taken 
bold steps in the wake of tragic 
shootings, the U.S. government 
continues to do nothing.

While 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 

understand 
or 
change 
the 

motives of domestic terrorists, 
the federal government can 

change their access to guns 
— especially to assault rifles 
and large magazines. Anti-gun 
control sentiment is too common 
in 
our 
federal 
government, 

which failed to reauthorize an 
assault weapons ban (found 
constitutional in court) when 
the ban expired in 2004.

In a 2016 Gallup poll, 55 

percent of Americans surveyed 
said that laws regarding firearm 
sales should be stricter. Though 
the majority of the United 
States is in favor of greater gun 
control policies, our lawmakers 
continuously fail to act. One of 
the largest barriers to federal 
common-sense gun reform is the 
financial hold the National Rifle 
Association has on Congress. 
A 
large 
number 
of 
House 

representatives and senators — a 
majority of whom are members 
of the GOP — receive monetary 
incentives from the NRA. The 
supposed “freedoms” granted by 
the Second Amendment are not 
worth the mass murders that are 
becoming all too common. While 
the NRA and White House 
recently announced that they are 
“open” to discussing regulating 
bump stocks — a device one 
can attach to a weapon that 

allows it to fire multiple rounds 
of ammunition in a row — they 
have yet to make any concrete 
plans and the timeline of any 
such legislation is unclear and 
promise of any follow-through is 
hypothetical at best.

While there is a place for local 

and state gun control, it does 
very little if someone can drive 
to Ohio to buy an assault weapon 
banned in Michigan. The federal 
government’s 
mandate 
over 

interstate commerce is needed in 
this matter to ensure the safety 
of those who live in all corners of 
our country.

Where 
are 
our 
elected 

representatives in the face of 
such bloodshed? Will we finally 
see Congress put people over 
party, stand up to the NRA and 
get something done after what 
happened in Las Vegas? Federal 
involvement is needed to combat 
staggering rates of gun violence, 
the highest in the developed world, 
in the United States. It is high time 
that Congress acts. Should they 
fail, it is up to concerned citizens 
to elect people who will.

Action against gun violence 
M

onday’s Las Vegas shooting, which left at least 59 dead 
and 500 injured, adds another tally to the United States’ 
dark history of gun violence. Action must be taken in 

order to end these incredibly avoidable catastrophes. The Michigan 
Daily Editorial Board believes issues surrounding gun violence 
should be politicized in order to enact much-needed change. In 
the following roundtable discussion, Opinion contributors suggest 
three different ways to help eliminate gun violence in the U.S. 
 
 
 
 
 
 —The Michigan Daily Editorial Board

Local 
and 
State 
Level 

Policy

If you are 25 or older, 

you have lived through six 
of the 10 deadliest mass 
shootings in United States 
history. Despite our nation’s 
collective 
nausea, 
the 

shooting in Las Vegas is yet 
another example that disgust 
has failed to beget legislative 
changes. After all, the last 
time our Congress passed 
any gun control legislation 
was 2013. With NRA-backed 
Republicans controlling both 
the executive and legislative 
branches, prospects in the 
near future are grim. Because 
of their inaction, we clearly 
cannot wait any longer to 
consider alternative means 
of progress. We must start 
demanding change in our 
states, counties and cities. 

“Local” change is almost a 

pejorative; everybody knows 
nationwide 
change 
has 
a 

greater impact and a wider 
reach. But, if politics is the 
art of the possible, then we 
cannot 
keep 
counting 
on 

Congress to pass the kind 
of laws many of us can see 
are so desperately needed. 

The consequences of stalled 
reform become more and more 
fatal with every homicide and 
mass shooting.

While gun violence may 

look slightly different state 
by state, the violence doesn’t 
vary so much that policy 
proposals 
for 
individual 

states must differ greatly 
from the kind of policies 
proposed nationally. Plenty 
of organizations, lobbyists 
and 
policy 
writers 
can 

make 
local 
legislation 
a 

reality. 
Requiring 
stricter 

background checks, limiting 
the amount and kinds of guns 
per household, closing gun 
loopholes and barring felons 
and 
members 
of 
federal 

watchlists from purchasing 
guns are all viable options 
on the local level. Though 
these are frequently referred 
to as “common sense” gun 
control laws, their individual 
impact 
is 
unknown 
until 

implementation. 
Some 
of 

these laws might prove to 
do more harm than good, 
especially if the punishment 
for 
breaking 
these 
laws 

falls disproportionately on 
certain populations.

There are many potential 

issues 
with 
attempting 

change on a more local level. 
It’s putting a bandage on a 
national wound, and there are 
still no mechanisms to stop 
the movement of guns across 
state borders, let alone from 
city to city. In addition to 
these policy issues, there are 
structural issues with a local 
attempt, too — people simply 
care less about state and local 
issues, especially in off-year 
elections. But, if gun control 
is truly about limiting access 
to guns, then a local attempt 
is a necessary start.

With 
a 
Congress 
that 

actually enacted the will of 
the people, we would have 
already taken steps to address 
gun violence. After all, polling 
indicates that more than eight 
out of 10 people in the United 
States support some form of 
gun control. In light of this, 
the legislative paralysis we 
are desensitized to is even 
more morally repugnant. And 
yet, the real tragedy would 
be to wait in the hope that 
things will change without a 
different approach.

Funding for Research

Las Vegas; Orlando, Fla.; San 

Bernardino, Calif.; Newtown, 
Conn.; 
Fort 
Hood, 
Texas; 

Blacksburg, Va. All have at 
one point been synonymous 
with the gun violence that has 
become almost epidemic in 
our country. Yet somehow, the 
notion of finding solutions to 
this crisis is scoffed at by many.

But why exactly is this 

level of violence unique to 
our version of freedom? A 
2016 study by The American 
Journal of Medicine found that, 
compared to 22 other high-
income nations, “Americans are 
10 times more likely to be killed 
by guns” as “the United States’ 
gun-related murder rate is 25 
times higher.” Unfortunately, 
the bulk of available research 
on gun violence stops there.

Gun 
legislation 
in 
this 

country 
is 
not 
drafted 

through 
careful, 
pragmatic 

consideration of public interest, 
but is instead pushed by those 
with the loudest voices and the 
deepest pockets. It doesn’t take 
much research to grasp this 
fact, and any American who 
truly cares about our citizens’ 
safety should acknowledge this 
system as flawed.

It could not be clearer that 

the NRA and the “logic” it 

peddles should not be what 
dictates our laws. It should 
instead be based on common 
sense and empirical realities. 
The availability of such data, 
however, is shockingly scarce 
and 
underfunded. 
A 
1997 

spending 
bill 
amendment, 

dubbed 
the 
“Dickey 

Amendment,” has prevented 
the 
Centers 
for 
Disease 

Control and Prevention from 
conducting 
comprehensive 

gun violence research in the 
two decades since. The NRA’s 
rationale for pushing this bill: 
The CDC is a biased, anti-
gun organization. The reality: 
The CDC is an organization 
formed with the purpose of 
safeguarding the public health 
by identifying threats to it 
and lobbying for and applying 
solutions to these threats.

Among 
the 
many 

problems with the discourse 
surrounding gun violence in 
our country is the subjectivity 
of logic. For instance, the 
debate 
over 
open-carry 

laws in numerous states is 
a clash between two lines 
of reasoning. On one end, 
opponents argue the danger 
of open-carry is that no law 
is broken until shots have 
been fired. On the other end, 
many would argue the “only 
way to stop a bad guy with a 

gun is a good guy with a gun.” 
Nevertheless, 
there 
is 
no 

doubt that in any discussion 
of gun control both sides will 
assert a logic they believe to 
be unassailable.

There are merits to a law-

abiding citizen wanting to own a 
gun, whether it’s for security or 
sport. There are far fewer merits, 
however, to a law-abiding citizen 
easily 
accruing 
an 
arsenal 

of 
military-grade 
weapons, 

ammunition and modifications.

The idea that many of our 

lawmakers would rather take 
the word of a corporate lobby 
defending its own financial 
interests over that of a federally-
funded public health institute 
is asinine, and it’s clearer than 
ever that this type of research 
needs to be the backbone of our 
legislation once again.

Maybe then we would live in 

a country where those suffering 
from mental illness couldn’t 
swiftly obtain guns, those on 
a terror watchlist couldn’t arm 
themselves with assault rifles 
and a deranged, law-abiding 
citizen couldn’t stockpile 23 
rifles and fire on 22,000 of his 
fellow citizens.

“I may be its first 

survivor.”

‘The Good Doctor’ fails to 
stand out among the pack

MEGAN MITCHELL

Daily Arts Writer

David 
Shore, 
the 
creator 

of the long-running medical-
drama “House,” fails to outlive 
the trope of his past series in his 
newest conception, “The Good 
Doctor.” Focusing on Dr. Shaun 
Murphy (Freddie Highmore, 
“Bates Motel”), a 
brilliant 
surgeon 

diagnosed 
with 

autism and savant 
syndrome, 
which 

give him genius-
like abilities, “The 
Good 
Doctor” 

raises 
moral 

questions 
unlike 

other 
medical 

dramas 
currently 

on air.

Though 
the 

series’ main focus 
is to push boundaries, the show 
does suffer from a bitter lack of 
originality. There’s too much 
going on. While Dr. Shaun’s 
characteristics are somewhat 
reminiscent 
of 
Dr. 
House’s 

attitudes 
on 
“House,” 
the 

model-esque doctors dragging 
one another into on-call rooms 
and supply closets is a perfect 
parallel to “Grey’s Anatomy.” 
It’s understandable for series 
in the medical-drama genre to 
overlap in certain aspects, but 
“The Good Doctor” feels like 
too much of the same thing 
with one completely new thing 
thrown into the mix. Coupled 
with Shore’s past work leaking 
into the present and Highmore’s 
attitudes 
as 
Dr. 
Murphy 

somewhat reflecting that of his 
previous role as Norman Bates, 
it seems like the two are sticking 
to what they know best, opting 
for success over originality.

However, though there are 

clear issues with borrowing 
— it’s hard not to be charmed 
by the series. Through the use 
of on-screen aids similar to 
those used in the popular BBC 
television 
series, 
“Sherlock,” 

Highmore conveys a lot with just 
his demeanor. Viewers think 
alongside Dr. Murphy, watching 
as 
his 
brain 
files 
through 

hundreds upon thousands of 
remembered material to catch 

up with his own 
thought process. 
You can’t help 
but feel charmed 
by 
the 
doctor 

who, as someone 
that claims to be 
bad with people, 
jokes 
around 

with colleagues 
at 
work, 
and 

feels emotions so 
deep that tears 
are brought forth 
from our eyes. 

On that same note, there are 
instances in which the series 
seems to be trying too hard to 
focus on Shaun’s deficits. Is this 
not a series about not focusing 
on deficits?

It’s hard not to laugh when 

Shaun, unceremoniously, strides 
up to TSA and asks for a knife, 
only to grab one and run through 
the airport. Immediately after, 
you have that feeling of “did I 
just laugh at that? I am so going 
to hell.” In a way, they could 
have done without this scene 
and the premiere would not 
have suffered in any way from 
its loss. It almost takes away 
from the brilliance of Shaun’s 
mind to see him suddenly 
chased throughout an airport 
for a misunderstanding. But 
perhaps that was what the 
creators 
had 
intended: 
The 

dualism that autistic individuals 
face, constantly walking the 
line between the crowd which 

“oohs” and “awws” around a 
high-functioning 
individual, 

yet chases down that same 
individual 
for 
simply 
being 

“different.”

After all, this is not the first 

time this has happened. Later 
on in the episode, Shaun, despite 
having saved a life and present 
for a job interview, is chased 
out of the hospital by security 
staff under the direction of him 
coming off as too “weird.” It’s a 
distressing image that I believe 
Highmore portrays rather well, 
especially so as he is turned away 
again and again without any 
prior explanation as to why he 
is being denied building access. 
It’s an opportunity for Shore to 
showcase the prejudices that 
autistic individuals often face. 
Would you have been denied 
entry simply for being different, 
as Shaun was?

Overall, “The Good Doctor” 

is a heartwarming series that 
shows promise typical of its 
genre. However, it must learn to 
present itself as an opportunity 
to see through the eyes of a high-
functioning autistic individual 
— not solely as another medical 
drama with a twist. It is vital 
that 
“The 
Good 
Doctor” 

differentiate itself from both 
Shore’s past projects as well as 
current series on the air such as 
“Young Sheldon.” On that same 
note, Shore must also learn that 
the fastest path to originality is 
by taking chances and stepping 
outside of boundaries, not just 
in one tiny aspect of the show, 
but in the entire essence of the 
series itself. It’s a delicate line 
that is drawn on a delicate topic. 
So far, “The Good Doctor” has 
proven itself the potential to 
become more than just a shiny 
new series, so long as it can 
continue to evolve in a way that 
keeps the heart of the show 
alive.

p.m.

NO FILTER
Jen Kirkman isn’t one to 
be compartmentalized

Don’t 
have 
a 
ticket 
to 

Saturday’s game? No worries. 
Comedian 
Jen 
Kirkman 
— 

who you may know from her 
appearances 
on 
“Chelsea 

Lately” and “Drunk History” 
or her podcast “I Seem Fun” 
— is bringing her “All New 
Material, Girl” Tour to the 
Majestic 
Theater 
Saturday 

night.

“I want to be as clear as 

possible that people are seeing 
material that is new to them 
and this isn’t me charging them 
to see some greatest hits of 
my two Netflix specials. So, I 
called it the “All New Material, 
Girl” Tour - to drive home that 
point and make a Madonna pun 
because why not?” Kirkman 
wrote in an email interview 
with The Michigan Daily. “It 
backfired in New York City 
recently when a man at the 
door wanted a refund for thirty 
tickets because he thought that 
he and his office friends were 
seeing Madonna perform her 
old hits like Material Girl. I am 
completely serious. So, there’s 
a lot of confusion apparently. 
Oh, America.”

Her most recent special, “Just 

Keep Living,” a non-ironic nod 
to Matthew McConaughey’s 
catch phrase, premiered in 
January on Netflix and is the 
latest product of the veteran 
comedian. After two comedy 
albums, two hour specials, two 
books, Kirkman has no plans of 
slowing down.

“Yeah 
there’s 
always 

something cooking with me, 
but I don’t tell until there is 
something to tell. I’ve got a 
necklace line going right now 
that I’m super excited about. 
Totally serious. It’s with a 
company called Bauble Bar and 
they actually partnered with 
a comedian and I’m selling 
necklaces that say things like 
‘Over Forty’ and ‘Childfree’ 
and ‘FeministAF.’ I’m loving 
it. I think everyone should buy 
some. It’s a limited edition that 
ends on Dec. 31,” she wrote. 
“This is what happens to 
female comedians over forty. 

It’s the law that we start selling 
jewelry 
and 
clothing. 
And 

that’s the only time I’ll make 
a joke about female comedians 
or 
say 
the 
words 
‘female 

comedians.’ ”

Alongside 
plugs 
for 
her 

necklace 
line, 
Kirkman’s 

Twitter 
is 
a 
mix 
of 

observational 
humour 
and 

scathing details on harassment 
from Bernie Bros and Russian 
Bots, but the balance comes 
naturally to her.

“I’m just a person flowing 

through life. I have a thought, 
I pull out the phone while I’m 
in line at CVS and I tweet. I’m a 
citizen on Twitter except when 
I’m promoting my shows. I 
don’t find the balance difficult 
or frustrating because if people 
want to compartmentalize me, 
that’s their problem. I don’t 
care what people think. I just 
want them to come to my shows 
and laugh. I couldn’t be more 
simple in that regard. I’m not 
worried about my “brand” or 
my message or my whatever,” 
she wrote.

But despite her politics on 

Twitter, she’s not looking to be 
labelled a “political comedian.”

“I have a strict definition 

of what it is to be a political 
comedian. I say that title 
literally means someone who 
does topical jokes every night 
about the news of the day, 
almost late night monologue 
style. So, no I’m not a political 
comedian in that sense. The 
way the country is going - 
does influence my comedy but 
it always has. My comedy is 
about my life, and my reaction 
to my life, and since I’ve always 
been a woman, and people 
have always hated women, 
I’ve always had a politically 
personal bent to my comedy, 
like talking about cat-calling 
or not wanting children. But, 
everyone seems to be asking 
me this question and I was 
never asked this question when 
other people were President 
so it seems like we are really 
in extraordinary times and I 
mean extra-ordinary in the 
bad way,” she wrote. “So, yes, 
people coming to the show 
will for sure get a sense that 
I live in the same world they 
do. As Jimmy Kimmel recently 

described it, ‘It feels like a 
portal to Hell has been opened.’ 
I’m in that portal too and so I’m 
hoping people find my show 
cathartic and comforting but 
if they’re looking for a Trump 
impersonation, 
they 
won’t 

get that from me. Although I 
will be wearing a toupee,” she 
wrote.

Although 
someone 
is 

probably 
angrily 
tweeting 

about Kirkman’s liberal or 
“feminazi” 
comedy 
at 
this 

very moment, she’s over the 
discussion on the acceptability 
of “rape jokes.”

“I don’t really sit around 

analyzing 
comedy. 
If 
men 

wanna talk about rape culture 
they better have a good fucking 
reason and they better be 
preaching on the right side of 
it. Otherwise, I’m so tired of 
this debate and it’s the least 
fun question on earth because 
whatever my answer will be 
won’t make someone be like, 
‘She’s so funny I have to see her 
show,’ ” she wrote. “I know you 
journos want deep conversation 
but people reading this stuff 
are like, ‘OMG shut up already.’ 
I should know. They tweet me 
when these pieces come out. 
I’d rather talk about aliens or 
something.”

However, if you are reading 

this thinking “She is so funny I 
have to see her show,” there are 
still tickets left for Saturday’s 
show.

“My comedy isn’t interactive 

unless I need have a question 
answered 
during 
my 
set. 

Comedy gets so little respect 
and people seem angry that 
you don’t want to talk to them. 
Folks, it’s like a play. I know 
the words I’m going to say 
and I’m excited to say them. I 
flew here to say them. If you 
interrupt me, you’re basically 
an asshole who wants more 
from a performer than the 
performance. Not cool. And it 
ruins the fun for the audience. 
They didn’t pay to see Jerry in 
the third row yell shit out.”

Don’t be Jerry.

SINGLE REVIEW

Originally cut from their 2016 
debut, Light Upon the Lake, 
“You and Me” was released 
to the world on September 29, 
along with the announcement 
of an upcoming record of early 
recordings, and a cover of Allen 
Toussaint’s “Southern Nights.” 

The song opens with a delight-
fully fast guitar riff akin to that 
of “No Matter Where We Go,” 
punctuated by an uncharacter-
istically synth-y keyboard. It’s 
bouncy enough to induce the 
delusion that maybe, just maybe, 
the Chicago-based, six-piece, 
self-described country-soul 
Whitney have written a purely 
happy song.

Within a minute that delusion 

is shattered. Electric guitar and 
keyboard drop out, replaced 
by a singular acoustic guitar 
and drummer-vocalist Julien 
Ehrlich’s familiar croon chimes 
in, wistfully: “Oh, darling / 
Remember, you and me, darling 
/ Remember, you and me, dar-
ling.” Bare and plaintive at first, 
the chorus slowly grows. First, 
the keyboard reenters, then 
drums and electric, transition-
ing directly back into the origi-
nal guitar melody, which then 
sounds decidedly melancholic.

Though familiar in melodic 
style, “You and Me” feels like a 
step forward for Whitney, even 
if it was written in late 2014, 
early 2015. Though it lacks Will 
Miller’s trumpet — one of Whit-

ney’s most alluring aspects — it 
sounds and feels more layered 
than any of the band’s previous 
releases. A string section, two 
different keyboard tones and 
almost every other instrument 
on the track are featured front-
and-center for at least a moment 
or two over the course of just-
under-three-minutes. Though 
many fans may find themselves 
growing impatient for Whitney’s 
second proper full-length, “You 
and Me” is as clear a sign as ever 
that Light Upon the Lake: Demo 
Recordings should be able to 
hold us over until the summer, 
when the next LP is due.

Reappraisal: ‘Dead Man’s 
Chest’ and ‘At World’s End’

In Reappraisals, Michigan 

Daily film writers attempt to 
defend films that have been 
critically maligned.

This week: Two “Pirates of 

the Caribbean” films, 2006’s 
“Dead 
Man’s 
Chest” 
(54 

percent on Rotten Tomatoes) 
and 2007’s “At World’s End” (45 
percent on Rotten Tomatoes).

“Pirates of the Caribbean”: 
 

It’s 
a 
franchise 
that 
is 

uttered in the same breath 
as “Transformers,” symbols 
of the Hollywood machine 
intent on cranking out as 
many sequels per year as is 
physically possible. To read 
reviews of the recent “Pirates” 
film is to be assaulted with 
descriptive 
language 
so 

unabashedly negative that it 
seems impossible there was 
ever anything good to be found 
in this series. The accepted 
consensus in the media world 
is that the “Pirates of the 
Caribbean” series has been 
garbage since the first one. I 
think this is absolutely unfair. 
In a cinematic landscape filled 
with generic, uninspired and 
mindlessly 
unimaginative 

blockbusters, to see “Dead 
Man’s Chest” and “At World’s 
End” lumped in with all the 
rest strikes me as ludicrous.

Far from being repetitive 

and derivative schlock like 
the more recent “Pirates” 
films, the original should 
be 
considered 
the 
gold 

standard for modern trilogy 
storytelling. The first film 
tells a complete story that 
leaves the door open for 

more. Parts two and three 
continue and then conclude 
the arcs of all major and minor 
characters, eventually uniting 
all the heroes and villains 
from the original film against 
a much more dangerous and 
chilling foe. People forget that 
before Jack Sparrow became 
a bumbling idiot, he was the 
smartest man in the room. In 
all three of the original films, 
Jack 
Sparrow 
continually 

outsmarts and outthinks his 
enemies, and we watch him 
grow from a selfish rogue to 
a true hero over the course of 
the three films.

Many 
blockbusters 

nowadays 
are 
rightfully 

critiqued for having basic and 
predictable plots, yet “Dead 
Man’s Chest” and “At World’s 
End” are both criticized for 
having plots that actually 
require the audience to think. 
“World’s End” in particular 
is accused of being byzantine 
and confusing, but the truth 
is that it’s almost like a heist 
movie: The more you watch 
it the more you understand. 
There are a lot of different 
layers to that movie, and yes, 
almost every character has a 
hidden agenda. That doesn’t 
mean the movie is bad though, 
or that it should be blamed for 
its audience’s stupidity. I for 
one would prefer more movies 
that actually ask something of 
the audience rather than hand 
them everything on a silver 
platter.

The films also boast wildly 

creative 
action 
sequences. 

From the three way wheel 
sword fight in “Chest” to the 
final ship-on-ship maelstrom 
at 
the 
end 
of 
“World’s 

End” these are imaginative 

sequences 
that 
are 
still 

remembered today and have 
stood the test of time. These 
first two “Pirates” sequels 
also succeed at world building 
in a way almost all other 
franchises fail to do. Like 
“Star Wars,” “The Lord of 
the Rings” and maybe a few 
others, the original “Pirates” 
trilogy 
feels 
like 
a 
fully 

realized world, with each 
addition uncovering a new 
part of the universe that feels 
like it was always there and 
you just couldn’t see it.

Unlike so many more recent 

blockbusters, 
the 
original 

“Pirates” 
films 
are 
both 

serious and fun. It seems like 
every Marvel or DC movie 
has to make a choice between 
being serious and having fun. 
The original “Pirates” movies 
remind us that there doesn’t 
have to always be a choice. 
These 
films 
have 
serious 

themes and dark moments and 
are also an absolute blast to 
watch. Directed by the same 
director all the way through 
and with the same writers, 
cast and crew throughout, 
they feel like a complete 
whole in a way the later films 
and most other franchises 
don’t. There’s a reason why 
“Dead Man’s Chest” and “At 
World’s End” were at one time 
two of the highest grossing 
films ever made but the fourth 
and fifth films have faltered. 
“Dead 
Man’s 
Chest” 
and 

“At World’s End” are smart, 
sophisticated 
blockbusters 

with compelling characters 
and emotional storytelling. 
Forget about throwing them 
in with the meaningless later 
“Pirates” movies. We need 
more trilogies like this one.

BOOK REVIEW
‘Funeral Platter: Stories’ 
encapsulates the absurd

Greg Ames, the author of 

“Buffalo Lockjaw” — a novel 
that won the 2009 Book of 
the 
Year 
Award 
from 
the 

New 
Atlantic 
Booksellers 

Association — has written a 
collection of short stories that 
might be one of 
the most absurd 
collections of the 
past 
few 
years. 

The 
only 
way 

I 
can 
think 
to 

describe the pace 
of “Funeral Platter: 
Stories” is to say 
that it moves like 
the galloping horse 
in 
every 
horse 

movie you’ve seen, 
at the moment the 
plucky protagonist 
aims 
too 
high 

and rides the wild horse that 
everyone warns can’t be tamed.

The 
characters 
in 
every 

story of “Funeral Platter” are 
unhinged; many of them have 
cast off the cloak of propriety 
and run around as if naked (not 
literally — for the most part). 
Many of them have no filters, 
either verbally or mentally, 
and we are privy to their 

most bizarre, uncomfortable 
thoughts. They are eccentric, 
erratic, 
sometimes 
ecstatic 

— and the style is stripped 
down to match. There are no 
unnecessary stylizations, just 
stenographic observations and 
dialogue that moves feverishly.

The first story sets the tone 

for the rest. A blind date — or 
what seems like a blind date — 
begins to take peculiar turns 

the second both 
people are there. 
At 
times, 
it 

feels like we are 
witnessing 
an 

eyeroll-worthy 
quirky 
meet-

cute, but it never 
builds 
to 
that 

recognizable 
rom-com 
crescendo; 
rather, 
they 

argue, and make 
up, and argue, 
and 
make 
up, 

and each time it gets more 
and more confusing as to how 
either of them got here. The 
ending leaves you even more 
bewildered than you were in 
the middle; and when looked at 
retrospectively, the beginning 
makes no sense either.

Stories that could be cute 

are missing the glossy facade 
that would make them so. One 

story is told from the point 
of view of a wisecracking 
thirteen-year-old who thinks 
his crossing guard returns his 
romantic affections — their 
significant age difference is 
but a gauntlet thrown down 
by a society determined to 
keep the star crossed lovers 
apart — but he isn’t exactly the 
most likeable of incorrigible 
boys. In another tale, a man 
casually dismembers himself 
as a form of revenge against an 
ex girlfriend, recounting each 
of his self-inflicted wounds, 
growing 
in 
severity, 
with 

savage satisfaction until he 
dies; you can almost hear his 
maniacal 
laughter. 
Another 

man follows an elaborate five 
step plan to get a wonderful 
girlfriend to break up with him 
(this one is eerily reminiscent 
of “Fight Club”). The final story 
ends what the first one begins; 
it is a tale of two idiosyncratic 
old lovers for whom “till death 
do us part” is but a challenge to 
be laughed at.

Some of the stories are more 

outlandish than others; even the 
ones that would be depressing 
are often just too baffling to be 
so. Where other authors have 
worked tirelessly to capture the 
pathos of the human condition, 
Greg Ames has effortlessly 
captured the absurd.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

If you were to make a checklist 
of things you might find in a fun 
and lighthearted music video, it 
would probably include dancing. 
Fashionable clothes. Attrac-
tive, young people who look like 
they’re having a really, really 
good time. Some hip setting — a 
club, maybe, or some other place 
where people go to let loose and 
have fun.

HAIM’s new music video for 
“Little of Your Love” hits every 
single one of these checkmarks. 
Sisters Alana, Danielle and Este 
Haim spend the entire video 
dancing and striding around a 
retro cafe space, complete with 

arcade games, pool tables and 
a nice big wooden dancefloor. 
A crowd of extras surrounds 
them, shuffling and clapping and 
tapping their feet. It’s a dance 
that looks coordinated, but also 
fun and approachable, in a you-
could-totally-learn-this-at-home 
type of way.

It’s nothing we haven’t seen 
before, but then again, the 
young-people-grinning-and-
dancing formula is tried and true 
for a reason. The “Little of Your 
Love” video is fun to watch, if 
not particularly inventive, and 
it’s interesting to see the ways 
in which the camera slips and 

slides easily between the three 
sisters as they trade vocal parts. 
It’s a video that beckons the 
viewer to join in with the joyful 
spirit of the song, and by the end, 
when the song escalates into 
jumping and clapping and then 
slams into silence, that effort 
does feel like it’s paid off. The 
dancers all stamp their feet in 
unison and freeze, and the video 
and the song wrap up quickly 
and neatly. It’s as if they’re say-
ing: “We’re all done, and wasn’t 
that a fun time? Wouldn’t you do 
it again?”

Behind Enemy Lines: Chris Frey

Last season wasn’t a banner 

year for Michigan State. Chris 
Frey is well aware of that.

Frey, a senior linebacker, was 

one of a few returning starters 
for a team that went 3-9 as the 
Spartans fell off 
a 
precipitous 

cliff 
only 
one 

year 
removed 

from a College 
Football Playoff 
appearance.

At 
Big 
Ten 

Media Days in 
July, Frey made 
it clear that he 
wants to put that 
all behind him. 
He wants to leave East Lansing 
as he arrived — staring at a 
championship banner.

“We want to be able to put a 

Big Ten championship banner 
on the wall,” Frey said in July. 
“We want to take the last Big 
Ten championship banner off 
the wall and spray paint on 
it. … We want to be a playoff 
contender. We want to win the 
East. And that’s the legacy we 
want to leave behind as a senior 
class.”

The Daily spoke with Frey at 

Big Ten Media Days in July to 
discuss his team’s turnaround, 
the development of younger 
players and whether there were 
any structural changes made to 
Michigan State’s defense. 

TMD: Do you guys think 

you’re closer to turning this 
around than saying, ‘Oh, we’re 
3-9, we have a way to go.’ Do you 
think you’re closer than people 
think from the outside?

CF: Like you said, going into 

the season, we’re a 3-9 team. 
It doesn’t matter. We’re here 
to put that behind us. But last 
year we were in a lot of close 
games and we failed to contend 
in the fourth quarter, and I 
think that’s where a lot of our 
downfall came, not being able 
to finish games. I honestly don’t 
know the stats of how close we 
were and certain things last 
year and I couldn’t tell you, but 
I do think we have a really good 
chance at turning this around. 
Not even a chance — I think we 

have a really good opportunity 
to turn this around. We have a 
lot of great guys on this team, 
guys that know what it takes 
and are going to give everything 
that they have.

TMD: You mentioned before 

the sophomores who had game 
experience last year. What about 

the freshmen and 
sophomores 
who 

haven’t played in 
games — how do 
you 
bring 
them 

along on that fast 
track?

CF: 
It 
comes 

down to reps in 
practice, honestly. 
During 
camp, 

they’ve got to step 
up if they want to 

play. They’ve got to step up and 
make plays in practice. Getting 
to know the guy that’s next to 
you, learning a lot from him, 
will help those guys be able to 
become better players and learn 
more on the field.

TMD: Without a bowl game 

last year, did that place a 
heightened emphasis on spring 

practices this past year?

CF: We moved spring practice 

up two or three weeks this year. 
We finished last year at Penn 
State on a Saturday and started 
workouts on Monday. So it was 
way, way fast-tracked and we 
were able to put the past behind 
us right there and start working 
for 
this 
year. 
We’ve 
been 

working for this year for eight, 
nine months now, and we’re 
ready to go. We’re just ready to 
put the pads on and start hitting.

TMD: Is there any added 

pressure on the linebacking corps 
to be the lynchpin of the defense 
considering the inexperience of 
the line and secondary?

CF: I don’t think there’s any 

pressure. I just think every 
year that’s something that we 
have to deal with. I think every 
single year the linebackers are 
the anchor of our defense, the 
guys that have the most playing 
time, the most reps and most 
starts, so I don’t think it’s an 
added pressure. I just think it’s 
something we’ve gotten used to 
over the years.

TMD: Last year, you guys 

finished last in the Big Ten in 
sacks. Is there more emphasis 
this year on blitzing linebackers?

CF: 
Definitely. 
Not 
just 

blitzing linebackers, but more 
of an emphasis on pass rush and 
drills to better ourselves at that.

TMD: 
(Michigan 
State 

Coach Mark) Dantonio talked 
a 
fair 
amount 

last year about 
RPO (Run/Pass 
option) and how 
that 
gave 
you 

trouble at times 
as 
a 
defense. 

Has that been 
an 
emphasis 

this 
offseason, 

any 
structural 

changes, 
anything 
like 

that to try to defend those?

CF: I don’t think it’s a 

structural change. I just think 
it’s trying to figure out the best 
way to defend it. We’ve changed 
a few things, but no matter what 
defense you play, it’s going to 
be hard to guard the RPO. You 
always want to play the run 
first, you can’t give up the run, 

so the second you see that run, 
you’re going after it, and when 
they realize you’re biting on the 
run, they’re passing the ball. It 
doesn’t matter which defense 
you’re playing in. You’ve just 
got to recognize the flow and 
trying to get a feel of if there’s 
a giveaway to whether they’re 

going to RPO or 
not.

TMD: Is that the 

toughest 
scheme 

for a young defense 
to play against?

CF: 
Oh 
yeah, 

definitely. 
Especially 
our 

STAR, our outside 
backers, 
because 

of trying to read 
the tackle and the 

guard and the running back and 
the quarterback, you can’t tell if 
they’re pass-setting or if they’re 
handing the ball off because 
the running back’s doing play 
action. You can’t really tell. So 
it’s really hard on our outside 
backers to make our read and 
then try to decide on what we 
think it is.

Four pops.
Five years later, and Chris 

Bryant can still hear the 
sounds.

It was the week before 

Michigan’s 
season 
opener 

against Alabama in the 2012 
season 
opener 
at 
AT&T 

Stadium. 
According 
to 

Bryant, a redshirt freshman 
at the time, he was on the 
verge of starting at left guard 
after a heated competition 
throughout fall camp. His 
parents 
had 
even 
booked 

flights to Dallas and couldn’t 
stop talking about how fired 
up they were to see him play.

“Three 
or 
four 
days” 

before kickoff, Bryant was 
participating in a routine 
offense-versus-defense drill. 

The running back made a 
cut. Someone fell on Bryant’s 
leg, and he heard the terrible 
noises — the sounds of a 
fractured tibia.

It was the first serious 

injury 
of 
Bryant’s 
career. 

Instead of flying to Texas, his 
parents went to Ann Arbor 
to talk to doctors about the 
medical procedures their son 
would have to undergo.

“It 
was 
very 
hurtful,” 

recalled Eric Bryant, Chris’s 
father. “You start focusing 
on how he’s feeling because I 
know it’s devastating for him 
more so than for myself or for 
my wife. But it’s a pain that you 
can’t really describe because 
you don’t want to show too 
much of that emotion to him 
because then that would only 
make him feel even worse.”

Over the course of the 

next year, Bryant underwent 
an 
arduous 
rehabilitation 

process. His leg never healed 
the way he wanted it to. Still, 
he was able to work himself 
back onto the field, drawing 
a spot in the lineup against 
Minnesota on Oct. 5. His 
return didn’t last long.

Just 
like 
the 
first 

catastrophic injury, Bryant 
can still describe the second 
in full detail. 

It was a routine double 

block. 
He 
had 
his 
own 

assignment and threw his arm 
out for an assist — where it 
got “completely thrown back.”

“I just felt a bunch of tears,” 

Bryant said, “all through my 
shoulder.”

He gritted his teeth and 

finished the game. In the 
following 
days, 
he 
tried 

desperately to tough it out, 

hiding his full symptoms from 
doctors, hoping he could play 
the next week at Penn State.

“This was my opportunity,” 

Bryant said. “I sat out a whole 
year, not about to sit out 
another year.”

But 
by 
the 
time 
the 

Wolverines had lost in triple 
overtime to the Nittany Lions, 
Bryant knew he had to get his 
shoulder looked at.

The 
diagnosis? 
A 
torn 

rotator cuff, with damage 
to other ligaments and the 
rest of the shoulder. And 
at that point, Bryant had a 
big decision to make. Was 
continuing his playing career 
worth it?

“Just came to a point where 

(you look) 20 years down the 
road,” Bryant said. “Do you 
want to be able to go outside 
in the backyard to throw a 

football with your kids?”

One night, Bryant spoke 

to his mother, Joy, over the 
phone. 
His 
injuries 
had 

constantly bothered her and 
she told him as much. She also 
told him about an intuition 
that had come to her.

“It was like I was dreaming, 

it was like God was shaking 
me, and I understood now, it 
was like a puzzle being put 
together,” Joy said. “It came 
to me, and that morning 
when I got up — we talk every 
morning — I said, ‘Christian, 
God spoke to me and told 
me for you to stop playing 
football, because he has a 
better plan for you. He told me 
to tell you to just give it up.’

“I said, ‘When you go to 

bed, you talk to God like you 
talk to me, and he’ll give you 
the answer.’ That night he 
did, and he said, ‘Okay, mom, 
I’m going to the coach and 
I’m going to let him know I’m 
taking a medical.’ ”

Chris 
Bryant’s 
football 

career — what had led him to 
Ann Arbor in the first place — 
was over.

“That’s 

what I’d been 
known for my 
whole life — 
as a football 
player,” 
Bryant, now 
Michigan’s 
director 
of 

high 
school 

relations, 
said. 
“To 

actually 
have to close 
that chapter 
and open up 
another one, 
it was tough. 
Took a while to get over it.

“A lot of long nights just 

crying, man. It was just a hard 
feeling.”

***

It took Bryant a “couple 

months” to deal with the end 
of his career.

He met with famed sports 

psychologist Greg Harden. His 
parents reassured him that 
things would turn out okay 
and told him that he would 
find his true calling. Bryant’s 
relationship with Brady Hoke 
developed quickly as well, 
especially in the aftermath of 
his second injury. The head 
coach met with Bryant often, 

checking up on him regularly 
and prodding him to think 
about his options. Did he 
want to coach? Did he want to 
recruit?

“Coach 
Hoke 
supported 

me the whole way,” Bryant 
said, “and sat me down until 
I found out what I wanted to 
do.”

And it just so happened that 

one of Bryant’s best friends 
was in a “very, very similar 
situation.”

Antonio Poole, a linebacker 

signed in the same class as 
Bryant, never played a snap 
due to two injuries — a torn 
pectoral 
and 
a 
ruptured 

Achilles tendon.

The two were roommates 

freshman year. At the time, 
they couldn’t have known 
what they were in for. But 
their friendship only grew 
as the pair bonded over their 
shared misfortunes.

“I was just like, ‘Damn, 

one of us gotta stay healthy, 
man,’ ” Poole said. “It was just 
funny, every time one of us got 
hurt, the other got hurt, and 
after that, we just bonded. It 

was just trying 
to 
keep 
each 

other’s 
spirits 

up, 
because 

coming 
there 

to play football 
and then things 
didn’t 
go 
the 

way we thought 
they would. We 
pushed 
each 

other 
through 

our rehab and 
continued 
to 

push each other 
and keep our 
spirits up after 
our 
football 

careers were over.”

Poole was the first to hang 

up the cleats. After Bryant 
followed suit, Poole found 
himself giving advice. They 
talked about ways to cope. 
About 
life 
after 
football. 

About finding a new identity.

Poole realized he couldn’t 

leave the game completely 
behind 
and 
became 
a 

recruiting assistant. Bryant 
was his first recruit.

“Yeah, I remember I told 

(Bryant), that was one of the 
great ways to stay part of the 
team, just helping out,” Poole 
said. “He asked me, ‘How was 
it?’ I said, ‘At first, you’ll be

In end of a career, Bryant finds peace

ORION SANG

Daily Sports Editor

COURTESY OF THE BRYANT FAMILY

Chris Bryant saw limited playing time as an offensive lineman in Ann Arbor due to a laundry list of injuries, but found a new role in the Michigan program.

I found a way, 

and I don’t 
know all the 
answers, but 
I know a way 
that I got here.


outside, watching the guys 
play and you’ll feel like, ‘Oh 
man, I feel like I could play 
again,’ but your body just isn’t 
allowing you. So I told him 
he’d go through that process 
as well and I was just telling 
him it’s great to still be around 
the team.

“You’re still caught up in 

helping the guys out and you 
contribute to the win — just in 
other aspects. Not on the field, 
but helping with gameplan, 
helping the coaches when 
they need something and then 
bringing in the new talent that 
comes and being mentors to 
the new freshmen and guys as 
we recruit them.”

As a player, Bryant had 

never 
realized 
just 
how 

much went into football. He 
was 
particularly 
unaware 

of the work that went into 
convincing 
high 
schoolers 

— like Bryant once was — to 
sign with Michigan in the first 
place.

That aspect appealed to 

him the most. Bryant liked 
being able to talk to kids who 
weren’t able to afford tuition. 
He liked being able to tell 

them that they could earn 
the right for Michigan to pay 
their way through hard work. 
He liked the “whole vision” of 
giving kids — that he felt, in 
some way, were like him — an 
opportunity of a lifetime.

It was all the more sweet 

that he got to do so alongside 
his best friend.

“We used to talk about it 

and (we) joke about it now — 
there’s no way in the world 
that another university in 
the country has two players 
that both ended up having 
to take medicals (who are) 
roommates 
in 
the 
same 

recruiting class,” Bryant said. 
“But at the same time, things 
happen, and I feel like that 
was God giving us each other 
to support each other and 
be there for each other. That 
was my boy, man. We’ve been 
through a lot together. I just 
can’t think of anybody else I 
would’ve rather went through 
everything 
we’ve 
been 

through together (with).”

Added Poole: “I think it 

worked perfectly. I really 
believe that — we were talking 
about that a lot — it was God’s 

will to bring us on this path 
and to show people that 
there is life after football, 
and that you can do it. 
Because a lot of people go 
into a very depressed mode, 
but you can make something 
out of it after you lose the 
game of football.”

***

Following a 5-7 season 

in 2014, Hoke was fired. 
As fate would have it, 
his replacement came in 
already 
knowing 
Bryant.

While at 

Stanford, 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
had 
recruited 
Bryant 
vigorously. 
He 
had 

hosted the 
Bryant 
family 
on 

an official 
visit 
and 

made 
Bryant feel comfortable.

When 
Harbaugh 
left 

for the NFL, Bryant didn’t 
anticipate crossing paths 
ever again.

In 
2015, 
though, 
he 

found himself sitting in 
Harbaugh’s new office at 
Schembechler Hall.

“Coach Harbaugh came 

in, and he knew who I was 
from recruiting, he knew 
about 
my 
injuries 
and 

everything like that, and 
we just had a conversation 
when he first got here,” 
Bryant recalled. “He asked 
me what I wanted to do, 
and I told him I wasn’t 
really sure. I didn’t know 
if I wanted to go into the 
real world yet, but I knew I 
loved football and I wasn’t 
ready to give it up.”

The two quickly reached 

an agreement: Bryant would 
stay on as an intern with 
the team while continuing 
his studies at Michigan’s 
graduate school for social 
work.

He had to work his way 

up from the bottom — this 
involved cutting a lot of film 
— but eventually he earned 
a paid internship, and most 
importantly for Bryant, he 
earned the responsibility to 
work with recruits.

“I 
felt 
comfortable 

sitting in front of recruits 
and 
different 
families,” 

Bryant said. “I felt like I 
had a unique story (in) 

that I was only here to start a 
couple games but I’m sitting 
here 
getting 
my 
master’s 

degree from the University 
of Michigan and not having 
to come out with any debt. … 
Coach Harbaugh felt like that 
was a unique story, and Coach 
Harbaugh is really huge on 
taking care of his guys.”

Harbaugh continued to give 

Bryant bigger assignments. 
He was tasked with bringing 
recruits on campus, where 

he’d host them 
on 
visits 
and 

give them tours 
around campus.

And 
then 

one 
day 
this 

past 
summer, 

director 
of 
player 

personnel Sean 
Magee grabbed 
Bryant and told 
him Harbaugh 
wanted to see 
him.

“(Harbaugh 

was) like, ‘We 
were 
thinking 

about making you our Director 
of High School Relations,’ 
” Bryant said. “And I didn’t 
really know — who was 
the director of high school 
relations, and what happened 
to him? And he’s like, ‘We 
never had it, and I feel like 
you’d be perfect for it. I feel 
like you have the character.’ ”

The promotion was a big 

step 
up 
in 
responsibility. 

Bryant describes the role 
as being Harbaugh’s “right-
hand man” when it comes to 
maintaining relationships in 
high schools and communities 
across 
the 
country. 
His 

importance 
only 
increases 

during 
the 
season 
when 

Harbaugh is busier.

He enjoys the role. But last 

summer, he had a chance to 
work in the area he eventually 
hopes to transition into.

In July, Bryant served as the 

director of football operations 
for Michigan’s annual Youth 
Impact summer camp. The 
program brings in kids from 
inner-city Detroit, where they 
work with Marines, football 
players and teachers from Ann 
Arbor public schools for two 
weeks before the experience 
culminates in a game of 
football at Michigan Stadium.

“It’s tough because I don’t 

want 
to 
leave 
Michigan,” 

Bryant said. “But I’m going 
to find a way to get my own 
nonprofit up and running. 
Just helping out inner-city 
kids, teaching them the path 

to get out of their situation 
and get to the next level.

“I feel like I could be a 

prime example. I found a 
way, and I don’t know all the 
answers, but I know a way 
that I got here. … That’s my 
whole goal, to be doing that 
within the next year or two.”

***

When 
Joy 
Bryant 
was 

pregnant, her doctor correctly 
predicted that her unborn 
child would play football.

“He said,” Joy recalled, 

“‘The way he’s kicking, the 
way he wants to come out, 
you’re going to have a little 
football player.’ ”

That eager baby never had 

the 10-15 year professional 
career he dreamed of. But 
he was still, as his doctor 
anticipated, a football player. 
And however short his career 
may have been, however brutal 
the injuries he suffered were, 
Bryant knows he wouldn’t be 
where he is now without going 
through all of it.

“I feel like I’m a walking 

action 
of 
what 
Michigan 

stands for — our values as 
far as taking care of our 

own,” Bryant said. “I’ve been 
through a lot, but everything 
I’ve been through, I just kept 
fighting, kept going through it 
… I had a goal in mind.”

He’s in a position now 

where he can use his story 
to help others — and he’ll 
continue to do so, even if that 
isn’t at Michigan.

Of course, the game still 

calls to him. Just a few weeks 
ago, Bryant was watching 
practice 
with 
graphic 

designer Aaron Bills when he 
told Bills he’d do “anything” 
to get on the field. Bills turned 
to him and told him that’s how 
he knew Bryant really missed 
football — he didn’t want to 
just play the game, he even 
wanted to practice.

“I tell you,” Bryant said, “to 

this day, I still go out there 
and I want to play football.”

Bryant doesn’t think that 

urge will ever subside. Yet 
he has no regrets about how 
his career panned out at 
Michigan.

It may seem paradoxical. 

But Chris Bryant found peace 
in football. He just needed to 
step off the field to get there.

Breakdown: Michigan State

Three. That’s how many 

times football has been played 
under the lights at Michigan 
Stadium.

On 
Saturday 
night, 
that 

number will go up to four.

At 7:30 p.m., the No. 7 

Michigan football team will 
take on Michigan State in the 
110th edition of the in-state 
rivalry.

The Wolverines (1-0, Big 

Ten, 4-0 overall) will face the 
Spartans (1-0, 3-1) at Michigan 
Stadium for the first time since 
an 
infamous 
botched 
punt 

cost them a certain victory 
in 
2015. 
While 
Michigan 

exacted revenge with a 32-23 
win last year in East Lansing, 
Michigan State’s 2-5 record 
at the time somewhat marred 
its significance. Though the 
Spartans are still unranked, 
it won’t be hard to see the 
significance 
of 
the 
game 

Saturday.

Here’s how the two teams 

match up:

Michigan pass offense vs 

Michigan State pass defense

For 
the 
first 
time 
this 

season, 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback John O’Korn will 
be leading the Wolverines out 
of the tunnel and onto the field 
at Michigan Stadium.

O’Korn has been handed 

the 
keys 
to 
the 
offense 

after redshirt junior Wilton 
Speight’s 
injury 
against 

Purdue, 
and 
he 
has 
been 

lauded for his attitude both on 
and off the field. He completed 
18 of 26 passes for 270 yards 
and a touchdown to topple the 
Boilermakers on the road, and 
he has had the bye week to 
prepare for Michigan State.

The Spartans will provide 

a stiff challenge in his first 
start, though, as they rank 
fifth 
nationally 
in 
passing 

efficiency defense and ninth in 
passing yards allowed. While 
O’Korn’s chemistry with his 
receivers looked solid against 
Purdue, Michigan State could 
throw the unit for a loop.

Edge: Michigan State
Michigan run offense vs 

Michigan State run defense

After falling behind fifth-

year senior Ty Isaac and junior 
Karan 
Higdon, 
sophomore 

running back Chris Evans had 
his breakout game against the 

Boilermakers, gaining 99 yards 
on 14 carries and scoring two 
touchdowns.

While Isaac is still expected 

to be the starting back — he 
leads the trio with an average 
of 89 yards per game — Evans 
will likely receive more carries 
than he has in recent weeks. 
The rotation has worked well 
for Michigan a third of the 
way through its season, so all 
three backs should play a role 
against Michigan State.

Though 
impressive, 
the 

Spartans’ rush defense, which 
ranks 16th nationally, isn’t 
quite as strong as its pass 
defense. 
Linebackers 
Chris 

Frey and Joe Bachie will head 
Michigan State’s efforts to 
stop the Wolverines’ staunch 
trio. But with three reliable 
backs, Michigan should be able 
to gain the advantage.

Edge: Michigan
Michigan 
State 
pass 

offense vs Michigan pass 
defense

When 
it 
comes 
to 
the 

offense, 
quarterback 
Brian 

Lewerke belongs in both of 
the next two sections. On the 
passing side, he has thrown 
for 963 yards with a 63.2 

completion 
percentage 
and 

eight touchdowns.

His main target, receiver 

Felton Davis, has caught 21 
passes for 256 yards and four 
touchdowns. No other wideout 
has more than one score. Davis 
will be expected to maintain 
that trend, as Michigan State’s 
passing game has the edge over 
its run game.

For 
Michigan, 
the 
rush 

defense is the star of the show, 
but the pass defense still 
performs admirably. While the 
secondary will face a unique 
challenge against Lewerke’s 
dual-threat nature, it seems 
prepared to handle it.

Edge: Michigan
Michigan State run offense

Lewerke is the single player 

most important to Michigan 
State’s success, and not just

What to Watch For

Saturday, the No. 7 Michigan 

football team (1-0 Big Ten, 4-0 
overall) will host in-state rival 
Michigan State in the first night 
game at Michigan Stadium since 
2014.

The last time the Wolverines 

played a night game at home, Brady 
Hoke was the coach and Devin 
Gardner was the quarterback. 
Times have changed, but the 
storylines are just as intriguing.

Here’s what to watch for when 

the Spartans and Wolverines 
kickoff at primetime this weekend.

1. O’Korn’s big day
Wilton Speight is out. John 

O’Korn is in.

After 
transferring 
from 

Houston and losing the position 
battle two years in a row, the fifth-
year senior is set to be Michigan’s 
quarterback for the foreseeable 
future.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

said Monday that Speight would 
be out for “multiple weeks” due 
to a soft-tissue injury. O’Korn is 

next in line, and following him 
are redshirt freshman Brandon 
Peters 
and 
freshman 
Dylan 

McCaffrey.

While O’Korn hasn’t played 

consistently during his college 
career, he threw for 270 yards and 
a touchdown off the bench against 
Purdue. He has enough offensive 
weapons to utilize — various tight 
ends and a deep running back 
group — that he can fall back on if 
he starts to struggle.

2. Michigan State’s weapon: 

Lewerke to Davis

Michigan’s 
run 
defense 
is 

the best in the nation, but it will 
face a challenge from Spartan 
quarterback Brian Lewerke, who 
has rushed for 248 yards and two 
touchdowns this season. The 
Wolverines have faced a mobile 
quarterback before — Air Force’s 
Arion Worthman — and they were 
able to quickly settle in and shut 
him down.

Lewerke’s playing at a high level, 

and while his feet certainly pose a 
threat, his recent connections with 
leading wide receiver Felton Davis 
III are where the Wolverines need 

to be focused. Davis caught two 
touchdown passes from Lewerke 
against Iowa last weekend.

Michigan’s 
defensive 
backs 

have done well so far against the 
pass, but Davis will be one of 
the top receivers they face this 
season.

3. Will the running backs 

keep spreading the wealth?

The running back revolving 

door 
continues 
to 
rotate. 

Sophomore Chris Evans is the 
latest to feature in the spotlight, 
and 
exceled 
against 
Purdue 

with two touchdown rushes and 
97 yards. Evans’ performance 
against the Boilermakers brought 
back memories of last year’s 
Hawaii game, when he had two 
touchdowns as well.

In both games, Evans displayed 

remarkable 
acceleration. 
His 

speed differentiates him from the 
other running backs: fifth-year 
senior Ty Isaac and junior Karan 
Higdon.

Michigan State’s defense has 

done well to stop the run so far, 
holding opponents to an average 
of just 96 yards per game. Earlier 
this week, Isaac spent time 
evaluating the Spartans’ defense, 
commenting on its physicality and 
blitz-heavy packages.

Isaac and Higdon, due to their 

size, are best suited to handle a 
physical run, but in the open field, 
it’s Evans that stands out from the 
pack. 

4. Will Chase Winovich take a 

single snap off?

Two 
days 
after 
Michigan 

defeated 
Purdue, 
defensive 

coordinator Don Brown went on 
the “Inside Michigan Football” 
radio show and informed the 
public that Winovich played every 
snap of Saturday’s game against 
the Boilermakers. 

The 
feat 
is 
impressive 

regardless, 
but 
was 
even 

more 
astounding 
given 
that 

the 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 

end accumulated 50 snaps in 
90-degree heat. As if that weren’t 
enough, Winovich finished with 
six tackles and four sacks — a 
performance that garnered him 
Big Ten co-defensive player of the 
week honors. 

Saturday night is expected to 

hover in the low 80s, and it will 
have all the energy of a night 
game against an in-state rival to 
go with it. Expecting a repeat of 
Purdue isn’t too reasonable, but if 
someone on Michigan is going to 
do it, Winovich is the best bet.

because of his arm. He is 

also the leading rusher for the 
Spartans.

Lewerke has rushed for 278 

yards on 38 attempts and scored 
two touchdowns. By comparison, 
Michigan State’s lead running 
back, LJ Scott, has gained 227 
yards on 58 attempts and has only 
scored once.

He hasn’t gone up against the 

Wolverines’ front four, though. 
The defensive line is the heart and 
soul of Michigan’s No. 1 overall 
defense, leading the nation in 
sacks and not trailing by much in 
tackles-for-loss. Lewerke might 
run straight into a brick wall 
against the Wolverines.

Edge: Michigan
Special teams
The story seems pretty set for 

Michigan in this phase of the 
game.

Redshirt 
freshman 
kicker 

Quinn Nordin has become a 
reliable source of points for a 
struggling offense this season. 
If called upon against Michigan 
State, Nordin can be expected to 
put the ball through the uprights.

Sophomore punter Will Hart 

has faced numerous problems 
in his first season as the starter. 
Though he has averaged 37 yards 
per punt with a long of 61, he has 
been responsible for multiple 
obvious errors. Freshman Brad 
Robbins took over against Purdue, 
punting seven times with an 
average of 40 yards. Robbins will 
likely retain that starting spot 
against the Spartans.

Michigan State hasn’t done 

much in the kicking game, but 
punter Jake Hartbarger averages 
43 yards on his attempts, slightly 
bypassing Hart.

Edge: Michigan
Intangibles
With the Paul Bunyan trophy 

on the line in a historic edition of 
the in-state rivalry, there is a lot at 
stake for both teams.

But in three previous night 

games at Michigan Stadium, the 
Wolverines have come away with 
a victory. They are favored to 
do the same in their fourth this 
Saturday. 

Not many in Ann Arbor have 

forgotten the events of that dreary 
October night two seasons ago. 
Michigan surely hasn’t. That’s as 
big a motivational tool as it gets.

Edge: Michigan
Prediction: 
Michigan 
24, 

Michigan State 14

A four-year history of the Michigan State rivalry

On a late Tuesday night in 2014, 

a Michigan Daily sports writer had 
just left from a night of editing when 
he stumbled upon the Diag block ‘M’ 
painted green with the letters ‘S’ and 
‘U’ alongside it.

An anonymous vandal had gone 

viral with just two cans of paint.

Pictures of the defaced landmark 

and a cleaning crew with a power 
hose spread online. Some Michigan 
students blamed their friends up at 
East Lansing, and others blamed 
a University fraternity that had 
camped out to protect the ‘M’ in 
prior years.

What happened in the last four 

years — since the painted blocked 
‘M’ — was a major turnaround filled 
with classic rivalry moments. Here’s 
our recap of the biggest moments 
in the Michigan-Michigan State 
rivalry over the last four years.

2014: 
Big 
stakes… 
in 
the 

Spartans’ turf

Disrespect was a common theme 

in 2014.

Wolverines fans were rightfully 

nervous in the days leading up to 
the 2014 Michigan-Michigan State 
football game. Michigan football 
was 3-4, suffering from losses to 
Rutgers, Minnesota and a 31-point 
shutout at Notre Dame.

And as if the spray paint on 

the Diag wasn’t taunting enough, 
few expected the Wolverines to 
have much luck against then-No. 8 
Michigan State and former Spartan 
quarterback Connor Cook.

In response to the hype, junior 

linebacker Joe Bolden walked onto 
the field before kickoff followed by 
his teammates. He held up a tent 
stake and drove it into the turf.

He 
later 
claimed 
that 
his 

intentions were to motivate his team, 
but across the field, the Spartans felt 
disrespected.

2014: Not even close, Michigan 

State victory

Once 
the 
stake 
was 
lifted, 

Michigan State ran all over the 
Wolverines for 446 total yards 
and four touchdowns. Cook threw 
over 200 yards, and aside from one 
rushing touchdown, the Wolverines 
weren’t competitive in any phase of 
the game.

To say the least, it was an 

embarrassing loss for Michigan. 
All went according to plan for the 
Spartans, and they continued to 
taunt the Wolverines all game. A 
group of Michigan State students 
camped overnight to get front row 

seats so they could show off the 
“KEEP BRADY HOKE” letters they 
had painted on their chests.

“They’re just breaking records 

left and right for sucking this year,” 
one of those students said to the 
Daily that year. “It’s great. It’s a 
historic year.”

2015: Magic Johnson gets a 

maize-over

Something about spray paint gets 

Michigan and Michigan State fans 
riled up.

A year after the Diag ‘M’ showed 

up green, an unnamed Michigan 
fan tagged the Magic Johnson 
statue outside the Michigan State’s 
basketball arena.

A large yellow ‘M’ appeared on 

Johnson’s chest, his face was painted 
yellow and the words “BEAT 
STATE” were written on statue’s 
base.

Though a recurring theme, this 

particular case of vandalism hit 
closer to home for Spartan fans. The 
Sparty Statue on Michigan State’s 
campus had been coated maize and 
blue multiple times in the prior years. 
Sparty was the usual target, and 
students were prepared to defend it.

Going after Michigan State’s most 

famous basketball alum seemed like 
a cheap shot.

2015: With Gameday on site, 

Corso goes blue

Ignited 
by 
new 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh, Michigan football was 
back in the national spotlight in 
2015. Despite a season-opening loss 
to Utah, the Wolverines had won 
five straight games going into rivalry 
weekend, including a 38-0 win over 
then-No. 13 Northwestern.

ESPN’s College GameDay aired 

from Ann Arbor for the first time 
since 2013. Michigan was ranked No. 
12, and the Spartans sat at No. 7.

Tensions 
brewed 
high, 
and 

when broadcaster Lee Corso picked 
Michigan to win by lifting an 
oversized Michigan helmet from 
beneath his desk, the crowd erupted.

What followed was one of the 

most memorable college football 
games not just of the year, but the 
foreseeable future.

2015: The fumbled-punt seen 

‘round the world

Do you remember where you were 

when Jalen Watts-Jackson returned 
the fumbled punt to beat Michigan?

Most people probably do, too.
Watts-Jackson’s 
name 
is 

ingrained in the minds of Michigan 
fans. 
When 
Michigan 
punter 

Blake 
O’Neill 
mishandled 
the 

snap, the college football world 
tuned in. It was a night to forget 
for the Wolverines, but a night that 

national media would never let die. 
Images from the game’s finish, like 
Michigan student Chris Baldwin’s 
shocked reaction, reappear every 
time the schools meet.

Ann Arbor went silent that night.
All game long, after parties were 

being planned and group chats were 
blowing up. “Michigan is gonna go 
top four,” somebody texted me in 
the third quarter. Maybe Michigan 
would have.

But when Watts-Jackson crossed 

over the goal line, that all came to a 
halt.

2016: A new recipe…
The 
first 
rematch 
after 

the 
botched 
punt 
was 
highly 

anticipated, but the scene in East 
Lansing had completely changed 
since Michigan’s last trip to the state 
capital.

Wolverine fans were present, 

and they made their presence 
known. When wide receiver Eddie 
McDoom ran a jet sweep, you could 
actually hear the “Doooom” chants 
from the visiting fans. No Michigan 
State 
students 
painted 
“KEEP 

HARBAUGH” on their chests.

Then-No. 2 Michigan dominated, 

and it was clear that Michigan State’s 
three-year run had concluded. The 
game wasn’t as close as the score 
indicated, and the Paul Bunyan 

trophy went back to Ann Arbor.

2016: … With Peppers on top
Late in the game, the Wolverines 

led 30-23. The Spartans had scored 
a meaningless touchdown, and in 
hopes of padding the score line, 
set up to attempt a two-point 
conversion.

They lost control of a toss, and 

linebacker Jabrill Peppers, the face 
of the 2016 Michigan football team, 
scooped up the ball and sprinted the 
other direction.

Peppers ran all the way for the 

safety. It might not have left the 
same impression as the prior year’s 
ending, but it stung for Michigan 
State fans nonetheless. When the 
clock finally reached zero, Peppers 
stood at midfield, and back flipped in 
celebration.

2017: To be determined…
It’s a quieter year for the rivalry.
Saturday night will be the first 

night game in Ann Arbor in three 
years, and the first night game of 
this rivalry in the 110-game series. 
Michigan and Michigan State will 
duke it out once again. There’s no 
College Gameday, no infamous 
vandalisms and No. 7 Michigan 
(1-0 Big Ten, 4-0 overall) is favored 
to win comfortably. As everyone 
knows, though, nothing is over until 
it’s over between these two teams.
