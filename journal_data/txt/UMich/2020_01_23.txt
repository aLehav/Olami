University of Michigan Provost 
Martin A. Philbert, executive vice 
president of academic affairs, 
was placed on administrative 
leave on Jan. 21 following several 
allegations of sexual misconduct.
According to an email sent to the 
campus community by University 
President Mark Schlissel, these 
allegations were first reported 
to University administration on 
Jan. 16, prompting a three-day 
investigation by an outside law 
firm and the Division of Public 
Safety 
and 
Security 
before 
Philbert was placed on leave on 
Jan. 20. 
In a message to The Daily, 
University 
spokesperson 
Kim 
Broekhuizen confirmed Philbert 
will continue to be paid while 
on leave “following our normal 
process 
that 
is 
afforded 
all 
employees.”

He is one of several University 
officials in the last few years 
to 
face 
scrutiny 
for 
sexual 
misconduct, following allegations 
against School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance professors Samuel Shipps 
and David Daniels last school year.
As provost, Philbert is the 
second-highest ranking University 
administrator and earns about 
$570,000 a year. In this position, he 
serves as both the chief academic 
officer and the chief budgetary 
officer. Philbert primarily works 
with Schlissel to set academic 
goals for the University and 
allocate funds towards them. 
All school deans report to 
Philbert, as he oversees the 
University’s 19 schools and colleges 
as well as several interdisciplinary 
centers across the University. Prior 
to his appointment as provost in 
2017, Philbert served as dean for 
the School of Public Health.

Martin A. Philbert, University 
of Michigan provost and executive 
vice 
president 
for 
academic 
affairs, has been placed on leave 
effective Jan. 21 due to multiple 
allegations of sexual misconduct, 
according to an email from 
President Mark Schlissel sent to 

students Wednesday afternoon.
According 
to 
the 
email, 
the 
University 
received 
the 
allegations last Thursday and 
Friday and began an internal 
investigation Friday. After a three-
day investigation involving an 
outside law firm and the Division 
of Public Safety and Security, 
Schlissel wrote he placed Philbert 
on administrative leave Tuesday.

“We take allegations of sexual 
misconduct 
very 
seriously, 
and our policy is clear: Sexual 
misconduct will not be tolerated 
in the University of Michigan 
community,” Schlissel wrote.
As provost, Philbert serves 
as the chief academic officer 
and budgetary officer for the 
University’s Ann Arbor campus. 
His purview includes promoting 

the 
University’s 
academic, 
teaching and research endeavors.
Because 
the 
Office 
for 
Institutional 
Equity 
reports 
to the provost, Schlissel wrote 
OIE’s reporting line for matters 
regarding Philbert’s investigation 
will be handled by Richard S. 
Holcomb, associate vice president 
for human resources.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Khalil Gibran Muhammad, 
professor 
of 
history, 
race 
and public policy at Harvard 
University’s Kennedy School 
of 
Government, 
gave 
a 
lecture on race and crime on 
Wednesday afternoon to about 
150 attendees in Weiser Hall. 
Muhammad, who is the 
author of “The Condemnation 
of Blackness: Race, Crime 
and Making of Modern Urban 
America,” spoke as a part of 
the 2020 Martin Luther King 
Jr. symposium. 

Muhammad contextualized 
the marginalization of Black 
identity 
by 
opening 
with 
an MLK Jr. quote about the 
disproportionate persecution 
of Black people by the police.
Muhammad 
noted 
while 
the term “mass incarceration” 
has become more popular, 
the 
phrase 
“racial 
criminalization” tends to be 
excluded from the narrative of 
criminal reform.
“Racial 
criminalization 
is defined as stigmatizing a 
racial group of people as a 
criminal regardless of guilt or 
innocence,” Muhammad said. 

“That is the idea of a criminal 
class without using the law or 
public policy to arrest or use 
the agencies of criminal justice 
to control those people.”
Muhammad 
said 
the 
institutionalized prejudice in 
the criminal justice system has 
its roots in the careful wording 
of the 13th amendment of the 
U.S. Constitution.
“The 13th amendment has a 
slavery loophole,” Muhammad 
said. “And that is that it 
abolished slavery except as 
a punishment for a crime 
whereof the party shall have 
been duly convicted.”

Muhammad 
said 
the 
criminal justice system turned 
a blind eye toward violent 
crimes, 
such 
as 
lynching 
Black people in the late 19th 
century. He explained this 
violence is increasingly seen 
as state-sanctioned domestic 
terrorism. 
“The state was complicit 
in the abridgment of these 
individual due process laws,” 
Muhammad said. “Under no 
circumstances 
are 
citizens 
granted the right to execute 
other citizens.”

The 
Erb 
Institute, 
a 
collaboration between the 
Ross School of Business and 
the School for Environment 
and Sustainability, hosted an 
event on Wednesday night to 
discuss how businesses can 
promote 
sustainability 
in 
their work. 
The event featured David 
Blood, 
co-founder 
and 
senior partner of Generation 
Investment 
Management, 
and a panel of four other 
speakers. They spoke to a 
crowd of about 500 students, 
faculty 
and 
community 
members in the Robertson 
Auditorium 
in 
the 
Ross 
School of Business. 
Blood 
described 
his 
previous experience in the 
industry and how he became 
involved in sustainability.
“I spent 18 years at Goldman 
Sachs and made the decision 
to retire in 2003,” Blood said. 
“I told my partners that I was 
going to set up a sustainable 
investment firm and they 
basically laughed and said, 
‘This confirms what we knew 
about you all along: you’re 
crazy.’”

support of 
new PFAS
litigation

Almost six years after a 
switch in water supply by city 
officials led to the Flint Water 
Crisis, 
Michigan 
has 
been 
facing another man-made water 
crisis affecting approximately 
1.9 million Michiganders. On 
Jan. 14, Michigan Attorney 
General 
Dana 
Nessel 
filed 
a lawsuit against 17 water 
companies for damages to the 
state of Michigan, alleging 
these 
companies 
knowingly 
allowed PFAS into drinking 
water.
Similar to the lead that fueled 
the Flint Water Crisis, the 
toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances 
— 
collectively 
known as PFAS — have lasting 
health consequences and are 
linked 
to 
numerous 
health 
diseases, including cancer. 
PFAS chemicals are human-
made 
chemicals 
that 
are 
resistant to grease, oil, water 
and heat and have therefore 
been used in a wide range of 
consumer products. PFAS have 
also 
been 
dubbed 
“forever 
chemicals” as they do not break 
down or biodegrade over time 
but instead accumulate in the 
environment.

Typically, 
the 
Office 
of 
Institutional 
Equity 
handles 
cases of sexual misconduct, but 
this office reports to Philbert 
and the Office of the Provost. 
In the email sent Wednesday 
afternoon, Schlissel said the 
reporting line for all matters 
related 
to 
investigations 
surrounding Philbert will be 
directed to Richard S. Holcomb, 
associate 
vice 
president 
for 
human resources. It is unclear 
what will happen to pending OIE 
investigations. 
“The U-M Board of Regents 
and I are committed to a full 
and 
thorough 
investigation, 
and we will continue to work 
to ensure the integrity of the 
process, following the same 
policy and practices that apply to 
all employees at U-M. It remains 
early in the investigation, and 
no findings or conclusions have 

been reached,” Schlissel wrote.
OIE began directly reporting to 
Philbert instead of the University 
Human Resources and the Office 
of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
in September 2019 to streamline 
OIE processes. Since then, he 
has faced questions about the 
length and effectiveness of the 
investigative process. 
At a November 2018 meeting 
of Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs, Philbert 
responded to criticism of OIE 
investigations, 
defending 
the 
process by which the office 
handled misconduct cases.
“I’ve heard concerns about the 
length of time it takes to complete 
some 
OIE 
investigations,” 
Philbert said. “We’re always 
working to ensure that those 
investigations are fair, thorough 
and timely.”
During Philbert’s time as 
provost, the University Board 
of Regents approved mandatory 
sexual 
misconduct 
training 
for all faculty and staff. At 

the September 2018 meeting, 
Philbert 
applauded 
these 
initiatives 
and 
encouraged 
education as the best means to 
prevent future misconduct.
“The University’s mission of 
education, research and service 
requires that every member of 
our community feels welcomed, 
valued and able to work free from 
the threat of sexual misconduct,” 
Philbert said. “Sexual misconduct 
is 
a 
very 
serious 
matter, 
something that we seek to prevent 
and that we are committed to 
addressing 
immediately 
and 
effectively should it occur. Our 
work to prevent and address 
such misconduct begins with 
education.” 
In 
the 
fall 
semester, 
Philbert was also involved in 
organizing a faculty group to 
look into amending the bylaws 
on 
dismissal 
and 
severance 
pay of tenured faculty. These 
groups were formed following 
controversy around the ongoing 
process of firing Daniels. Since 

being placed on paid leave in 
August 2018, Daniels has made 
over $100,000 in salary from the 
University.
At an October 2019 SACUA 
meeting, Philbert said amending 
the bylaws was necessary to 
react more promptly to faculty 
wrongdoing. 
“We have to be very careful 
and thoughtful, and quickly 
amend the bylaws to protect 
tenure and to protect our faculty 
and to protect society from the 
bad behavior that is frequently in 
the headlines,” Philbert said. 
At a 2017 reception held 
in 
honor 
of 
his 
provost 
appointment, 
Philbert 
said 
his goal in the position was to 
encourage national investment 
in academia. He was also a 
supporter of the campaign to 
add a Middle Eastern/North 
African ethnicity designation to 
University documents. 

The impact of their continued 
use since the 1940s means that 
over time, PFAS levels from 
past and current uses can 
result in increasing levels of 
environmental contamination. 
The lawsuit filed by the 
attorney general argues the 
defendants knew or should 
have 
known 
that 
PFAS 
persists in the environment 
and would build up in animals 
and humans exposed to the 
chemical. 
Additionally, 
the 
lawsuit also notes that the 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency concluded there is an 
association between exposure 
to PFAS and a variety of 
health complications including 
thyroid disorders, pregnancy-
induced 
hypertension 
and 
preeclampsia, 
as 
well 
as 
testicular and kidney cancer. 
The 
state 
names 
17 
defendants 
in 
the 
lawsuit 
and alleges they deliberately 
concealed 
the 
dangers 
of 
PFAS, 
withheld 
scientific 
evidence and “intentionally” 
sold, 
distributed, 
released, 
transported, 
supplied 
and 
arranged 
for 
disposal 
or 
treatment into areas affecting 
Michigan’s natural resources 
and 
property. 
Additionally, 

it 
asserts 
the 
companies 
handled and used PFAS and 
PFAS-containing materials in 
Michigan in a way they knew 
would 
contaminate 
natural 
resources and expose Michigan 
residents to harm. 
Three of these companies 
named in the lawsuit — 3M, 
DuPont 
and 
Chemours 
— 
have been involved in several 
other lawsuits since 2016. In 
February 2017, DuPont and its 
spin-off, Chemours, settled a 
lawsuit with more than 3,500 
residents in Ohio and West 
Virginia. While denying any 
wrongdoing, they agreed to pay 
$671 million for polluting an 
area around a manufacturing 
plant in Parkersburg, West 
Virginia.
Ann Arbor is now one of 
the 11,000 sites in Michigan 
where the drinking water has 
been contaminated with PFAS 
chemicals. The city of Ann 
Arbor began tracking the PFAS 
content in the city’s drinking 
water in March 2018 and found 
five types of PFAS in Ann 
Arbor’s treated drinking water 
and two other types in the river 
water.
Following 
new 
carbon 
filters at the water treatment 
plant, PFAS levels lowered to 
single-digits in the spring of 
2019. However, in October of 
2019, PFAS levels increased by 
more than tenfold, jumping to 

25-29 ppt. The city stated that 
causes for this increase are still 
unknown. 
A statement released by U.S. 
Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich. 
applauds Governor Gretchen 
Whitmer and Attorney General 
Nessel for holding polluters 
accountable, as Dingell claims 
Michigan was ground zero for 
PFAS contamination.
“The most troubling thing 
I have learned through all of 
this is that the manufacturing 
companies knew about the 
harms of PFAS — and even 
tracked it in the blood of 
employees — while the EPA 
has completely abandoned its 
responsibility to act swiftly and 
comprehensively to respond,” 
Dingell said. “This is wrong and 
they must be held accountable.”
Dingell is also the lead 
author of the PFAS Action Act, 
a bipartisan bill cosponsored by 
U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich. 
and U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, 
D-Mich. The bill would provide 
protections 
for 
impacted 
communities 
by 
requiring 
the 
EPA 
to 
limit 
human 
exposure and set a drinking 
water standard for PFAS that 
protects public health. The 
bill was passed in the House of 
Representatives on Jan. 10 with 
bipartisan support.
In 
Upton’s 
district, 
the 
city of Parchment was one 
of the first cities of PFAS 

contamination. As one of the 
original 
cosponsors, 
Upton 
released a statement detailing 
the importance of protecting 
Americans 
from 
PFAS 
contamination. 
“This 
legislation 
would 
designate PFAS chemicals as 
hazardous 
substances 
and 
allows the EPA to clean up 
contaminated sites in Michigan 
and across the country,” Upton 
said. 
“Parchment 
made 
it 
perfectly clear that we need an 
all-hands-on deck to protect 
our families, drinking water, 
and environment, and I will 
continue to work with my 
colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to address this challenge 
across the nation.”
Public Policy senior Claire 
Galligan 
previously 
worked 
in Kildee’s office and spoke 
about her frustration with the 
continued PFAS contamination. 
She said she was happy to hear 
about the bipartisan legislation.
“It’s extremely disappointing 
to hear that water companies 
have knowingly contaminated 
Michigan’s water with PFAS,” 
Galligan said. “I think there’s 
definitely a strong need for 
legislation to protect Michigan’s 
water from contamination, and 
hopefully it will receive strong 
bipartisan support considering 
this impacts so many districts 
in Michigan.”

Blood co-founded GIM with 
Al Gore, a climate activist and 
former U.S. Vice President, in 
2004. He said his interests in 
sustainability and development 
and 
Gore’s 
passion 
for 
environmental 
protection 
resulted 
in 
the 
successful 
business model they currently 
use.
“My interest is in poverty and 
social justice and sustainable 
development,” Blood said. “Al’s 
is obviously an interest in the 
environment. And when we 
were talking that first day, we 
recognized that they are the 
same issue. They’re the same 
coin, 
they’re 
just 
different 
sides.”
Following Blood’s comments, 
three other panelists joined 
him on the stage. Chad Spitler, 
founder and CEO of Third 
Economy, moderated the panel 
and posed various questions to 
each of the speakers. 
In response to a question 
about efforts to combat climate 
change, 
Michael 
Dorsey, 
partner at Ibersun Solar and 
a member of Club of Rome, 
said many countries initially 
promised 
to 
provide 
large 
amounts of money but have not 
fulfilled that promise. 
“So if you had $5,000 of 
housing damage and I came 
along and gave you $1, you 
might want to get in my face,” 
Dorsey explained. “Essentially, 
that’s what governments have 
done, particularly in the case 
of Africa, so it’s not just that 
we haven’t assembled enough 
money. The money that we’ve 
assembled is actually, I would 
offer, is generating climate 
injustice.”
Jennifer 
Haverkamp, 
director of the University’s 
Graham 
Institute 
and 
law 
professor, said she believed the 
government should still have 

an important role in generating 
and 
implementing 
climate 
change solutions. 
“I 
think 
there 
is 
still 
an 
important 
role 
for 
government,” Haverkamp said. 
“The United States government 
right now is not at the table, but 
when you think about how the 
prices of renewables have gone 
down a certain amount, China 
was doing that to help lower 
the cost of solar panels and 
things like that.” 
Blood 
agreed 
with 
Haverkamp, saying he thought 
the 
government 
needed 
to 
be involved in the process 
in addition to other outside 
organizations. 
“As much as I’d like to say we 
can sort this out from capital 
markets 
and 
business, 
we 
cannot,” Blood said. “Business 
will be part of the solution, civil 
society will need to be part of 
the solution, and we are now 
getting to the point where we 
will need active involvement in 
government.” 
At the end of the event, 
the panelists took audience 
questions submitted through 
Twitter. 
One Twitter user asked how 
society can transition to a low 
carbon economy if Business 
students are not required to 
learn about the climate in many 
core classes. 
Following 
loud 
applause, 
a 
faculty 
member 
in 
the 
audience said the Business 
deans are currently working on 
implementing a related change.

sophomore 

Mia 
Zapata 
came 
to 
the 
event because she is taking

class 
about

and

thought 
Business 
students 
should be required to take 
a class about this topic or 
attend mandatory events. 

Muhammad explained how 
health statistics in the Jim 
Crow 
era 
contributed 
to 
the discrimination of Black 
people.
“A 
number 
of 
social 
scientists 
suggested 
that 
by looking at demographic 
data, particularly the census 
report on health statistics, one 
could make general claims on 
the fitness of certain racial 
groups,” 
Muhammad 
said. 
“The late 19th century was 
steeped 
in 
various 
forms 
of scientific racism that we 
cannot dismiss today.”
Muhammad 
said 
census 
data 
was 
manipulated 
by 
the government in order to 
undermine 
the 
educational 
opportunities 
of 
Blacks 
individuals. The incarceration 
of Black people, especially 
men, became both a symptom 
and a justification for the 
further 
suppression 
of 
freedom, contributing to a 
cycle of discrimination. 
“Evidence 
of 
Black 
criminality became an excuse 
for Black terror,” Muhammad 
said. 
Muhammad also described 
how 
other 
marginalized 
groups, such as Italian and 
Irish 
immigrants, 
were 

subjected to some statistical 
scrutiny 
but 
much 
less 
persecution. He said Anglo-
Saxon immigrant communities 
were given social support in 
order to combat poverty and 
enjoyed lower crime rates. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
Muhammad 
said 
Black 
communities were met with 
increased policing.
“There was an economic 
argument 
for 
prioritizing 
social resources for European 
immigrants and crime control 
resources for people of African 
descent,” Muhammad said.
LSA 
freshman 
Chloe 
Darancou told The Daily her 
overarching takeaway from 
the lecture was about the need 
for change. 
“Although there has been 
progress in recent years, we 
still have a long way to go 
with police brutality being a 
common phenomenon in our 
society,” Darancou said.
LSA 
sophomore 
Maddie 
Herman 
said 
the 
lecture 
made her think more deeply 
about common perceptions of 
justice. 
“We are ignoring the trends 
that are clearly right in front 
of us due to ignorance and a 
lack of information,” Herman 
said. “We need to become 
more aware in order to change 
the mantras that we are telling 
ourselves.”

“The U-M Board of Regents 
and I are committed to a full and 
thorough investigation, and we 
will continue to work to ensure the 
integrity of the process, following 
the same policy and practices that 
apply to all employees at U-M,” 
Schlissel 
wrote. 
“It 
remains 
early in the investigation, and no 
findings or conclusions have been 
reached.”
Following 
the 
email, 
Rep. 
Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., wrote 
in a tweet that the University is 
quickly stepping up to investigate 
allegations against Philbert.
“Everyone deserves due process 
and a thorough investigation,” 
Dingell wrote. “It is still difficult 
for survivors to come forward 
in situations like these, and we 
need recognize their bravery and 
courage.”
University Regent Jordan Acker 
(D) also wrote in a tweet that he 

believes the investigation into the 
allegations must be transparent.
“Today is a sad day for the 
University,” Acker wrote. “I am 
angry and deeply empathetic to 
the survivors, and am committed 
to ensure that it never occurs on 
our campus again.”
Philbert 
was 
approved 
as 
provost in June 2017 and assumed 
the position in September 2017. 
Previously, he served as dean of the 
School of Public Health.
In 
October 
2019, 
Philbert 
met with the Senate Advisory 
Committee on University Affairs 
to recommend amendments to 
policies on the dismissal of tenured 
faculty following the firing of 
Music, Theater & Dance professor 
David Daniels for allegations of 
sexual misconduct.
“We have to be very careful and 
thoughtful, and quickly amend the 
bylaws to protect tenure and to 
protect our faculty and to protect 
society from the bad behavior that 
is frequently in the headlines,” 
Philbert said at the meeting.

How to make exercising as addicting as social media
L

ast Wednesday I got 
out 
of 
my 
morning 
lecture 
early, 
and 
although part of me was inclined 
to head to the library and study 
for my organic chemistry exam, 
another part was begging to enjoy 
what was left of the day. It was 40 
degrees outside and there was not 
a cloud in the sky. You don’t get 
many days like that in the middle 
of January in Michigan. I decided 
to go on a quick run between 
classes to enjoy the weather. 
I took Geddes Avenue into 
Nichols Arboretum and then 
ran down to the Huron River. 
I was definitely on a runner’s 
high that morning. “Ladders” by 
Mac Miller was playing in my 
headphones, and I could feel my 
pace speeding up. As soon as the 
bass dropped, I reached an uphill 
part of my run. It was as if Spotify 
was synchronizing the music to 
my route. I ran up the hill at a 
blazing pace, and I knew this run 
was going to be a personal record 
on Strava.
Strava is a social network 
for athletes, and although it’s 
geared 
toward 
running 
and 
cycling, the app lets you measure 
your athletic performance in a 
variety of activities including 
rowing, 
surfing, 
ice 
skating, 
kayaking, rock climbing, skiing 
and more. Once you choose your 
type of workout and click the 
start button, the app will begin 
tracking stats including distance, 
time, speed, route, elevation gain 
and average pace along with 
many other features. It is a great 
way for athletes to track their 
training plans, but also a fun way 
for those who are new to working 
out to track their fitness goals. 

The platform allows you to record 
your favorite statistics and post 
them along with a photo to round 
out the full fitness experience. 
Your followers can give your 
workout a “kudos” which is 
equivalent to a “like,” as well as 
comment on your post. 
Strava, unlike other social 
media apps, emphasizes personal 
goal setting and celebrating your 
own fitness accomplishments. On 
Strava, you have the opportunity 
to connect with close friends 
who are also tracking their 
workouts 
and 
support 
each 
other in obtaining fitness goals. 

It provides a way to feel the 
support of your community, even 
when your workout buddies are 
not physically there with you. 
The aspect of community 
in fitness is important. In a 
study on medical students, it 
was found that individuals who 
work out in a group have a lower 
stress rate and better quality 
of life than those who work out 
alone. Strava could serve as an 
alternative when you can’t have 
a group with you, but still desire 
the encouragement a community 
provides. It can be difficult to 
find inspiration to push yourself 

when you are working out by 
yourself. 
The 
intersection 
between 
social 
media 
and 
fitness 
is 
growing in popularity so much 
that the term “fitspiration” has 
emerged. However, this type 
of inspiration is not always 
beneficial. Many times, it can 
lead to low self-esteem or body 
image issues when comparing 
oneself to fitness trainers, athletes 
and other health gurus that you 
most likely will never cross paths 
with in real life. I have caught 
myself multiple times scrolling 
through Instagram and seeing 
posts about the latest cycling 
trip, 
backpacking 
expedition, 
triathlon or exotic yoga retreat 
that celebrity athletes have just 
accomplished. Meanwhile, I am 
questioning why I just ate that 
cinnamon pizza bread from MoJo.
Let’s admit it, we all have those 
days when we feel like doing 
absolutely nothing. After class, 
we would rather head home and 
curl up with a cozy blanket and 
Netflix to relax instead of going to 
the gym. Your dedication to those 
New Year’s resolutions might be 
starting to wear off, and that’s 
okay; it just means there’s a need to 
find motivation elsewhere. Fitness 
apps, like Strava, can provide that 
motivational factor. When I go 
on Strava and see how active my 
friends on campus are, it gives 
me the ambition to work out and 
produce stats worthy of “kudos.” 
Sure, maybe I’m addicted to social 
media, but at least it’s in a way that 
drives me to be more active and 
take part in a healthier lifestyle.

Taiwan elections reflect power of Hong Kong protests
E

arlier 
this 
month, 
Taiwanese 
voters 
went to the polls to 
decide the future direction 
of 
their 
country’s 
historically 
hostile 
relationship with the 
Communist 
Party 
of China (CPC). At 
their 
hands 
were 
options 
to 
move 
toward some form of 
greater reconciliation 
with 
President 
Xi 
Jinping 
and 
his 
government, or for 
Taiwan to remain as 
nationally distinct as possible. 
On Jan. 11, the people of 
Taiwan emphatically decided 
to maintain their independence 
from the CPC and continue their 
fight for legitimacy. As a result, 
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-
wen won reelection amid an 
unusually large voter turnout 
and is set to continue her defense 
of 
Taiwan’s 
autonomy 
from 
Beijing’s far-reaching tentacles.
Tsai Ing-wen has proven to be 
a revolutionary figure who spoke 
out against a 1992 understanding 
reached by the CPC and the then-
ruling 
Taiwanese 
government 
that a “one country, two systems” 
framework would be implemented 
someday, and Taiwan would 
not 
declare 
itself 
officially 
independent from China. Tsai Ing-
wen has vocally expressed that 
such an agreement would not be 
beneficial to Taiwan. Her running 
mate has hinted at moving toward 
independence, though Tsai Ing-
wen has denied having such an 
objective.
The ongoing protests that have 
rocked Hong Kong since last 
spring are sure to have played 
a prominent role in the votes of 
millions of Taiwanese citizens, 
as well as Tsai Ing-wen’s policy 
toward China. The months of 
unending 
civil 
and 
political 
unrest in the city stemmed from 
exactly the type of system that 
Taiwanese voters clearly decided 
to avoid. The Chinese Nationalist 
Party, which ran against Tsai Ing-
wen’s 
Democratic 
Progressive 
Party, seeks to bring Taiwan into 
a political framework of greater 
Chinese 
influence, 
satiating 
China’s leaders’ quest of bringing 
Taipei ever closer to the arms of 
the CPC. With the “One China” 
policy living on to this day, the 
People’s Republic of China is still 
trying to bring Taiwan under their 
control. 
In recent years, China has 
worked especially hard to put 
pressure on Taiwan and spread 
fear throughout the island. Beijing 
showed great support to Han Kuo-
yu, Tsai Ing-wen’s main opponent, 

and has demonstrated approval 
for developing Chinese hegemony 
over Taiwan’s democratic system. 
However, China’s efforts have 
not been limited to 
political 
messaging. 
Over the past few 
years, 
the 
Chinese 
military has created 
a series of artificial 
islands in the South 
China 
Sea, 
actions 
which the government 
has maintained are 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
defend 
Chinese 
interests. These naval 
installations pose a threat to any 
country which also claims the 
right to freely operate and travel 
in the area. This particularly 
includes Taiwan, which would 
be threatened by the proximity 
of China’s navy should a violent 
standoff arise in the future. 
The South China Sea is one 
of the most vital international 
shipping passages in the world, 
and 
if 
China 
continues 
its 
aggressive development of islands 
and insistence that the sea belongs 
solely to China, the future of free 
trade — not to mention Taiwanese 
autonomy — will be put at massive 
risk.

Amid 
this 
frightening 
geopolitical reality, Taiwanese 
civilians can look to Hong Kong 
as an example of what could 
happen if they accepted a slow 
yet decisive move toward China’s 
domain. In recent headlines, 
Taiwanese donors have supplied 
Hong Kong with 2,000 gas 
masks, air filters and helmets: 
an act of solidarity in the face of 
shared regime repression. They 
see the young men and women 
brandishing 
gas 
masks 
and 
braving police forces to stand and 
defend their democratic system. 
They witness Hong Kong’s weak 
leadership doing little to assuage 
the fears of its people. Above all, 
they can see the unbearable toll 
the protests have taken on the 
semi-autonomous city for nearly 
a year. When considering a future 
for their children, Taiwanese 
voters rejected such a path, at the 
end of which their high school 
and college students would be 

called upon to take on a brutal 
regime alone. That is not a fate 
that any parent would wish upon 
their children.
As 
such, 
Tsai 
Ing-wen’s 
reelection 
represents 
the 
strength and resilience of the 
Taiwanese people in the face 
of growing pressure from the 
CPC. She will surely face great 
challenges 
in 
her 
quest 
to 
achieve, maintain and enhance 
Taiwanese national identity and 
possibly independence, but the 
polls indicate that her people 
believe in her to advance their 
interests.
Going forward, it will be 
interesting 
to 
monitor 
the 
behavior of the U.S. vis-à-vis 
an empowered Taiwan and an 
emboldened China. For decades, 
the U.S. has followed Beijing’s 
“One China” policy, which states 
that countries must only have 
official diplomatic relations with 
the PRC and not the “breakaway” 
and 
“illegitimate” 
Chinese 
government of Taiwan. Yet the 
U.S. 
has 
quietly 
maintained 
a 
relationship 
with 
Taiwan, 
one that has included billions 
of dollars in arms sales, since 
the Taiwan Relations Act was 
passed by U.S. Congress in 1979. 
Despite 
the 
understanding 
reached by former President 
Carter with Beijing, in which 
U.S. Presidents did not officially 
speak with Taiwan’s leaders, 
President Donald Trump has 
had noteworthy contact with the 
Taiwanese government.
Following 
the 
Taiwanese 
election, countries perceived by 
Beijing to be getting too close 
to Taipei have been harshly 
punished. 
Most 
notably, 
the 
government in Shanghai has 
cut off all relations with Prague 
after the Czech Republic’s capital 
signed a sister-city agreement 
with Taipei and not Beijing. 
As a result, Trump’s policy 
surrounding 
the 
decades-long 
conflict will surely have practical 
implications for both the U.S. 
and Taiwan, especially as Trump 
works with President Xi to 
stabilize U.S.-China trade. 
However, 
the 
discourse 
surrounding Taiwan somewhat 
appears to be changing, for the 
benefit of the U.S. and Taiwan. 
Both because it is just, and because 
it can be used to curb China’s 
economic and political behavior, 
the U.S. should lead the change 
in the world’s approach to the 
island that, like Hong Kong, 
is simply fighting to keep its 
autonomy 
and 
democracy 
afloat.

Not your mother’s Banana Republic

I

t 
was 
always 
a 
great 
challenge for my mother 
to 
coax 
my 
younger 
self into eating fruits and 
vegetables. These days, I am not 
a particularly picky eater. After 
learning to subtly incorporate 
fruits into my favorite foods, 
I now put blueberries in my 
pancakes and strawberries in 
my yogurt with glee. But I once 
had a terrible aversion to fruits 
and vegetables, save one — the 
banana. To this day, my love 
for bananas far surpasses my 
appreciation for any other fruit. 
The 
banana 
plant 
grows 
quickly and cheaply in tropical 
areas — like those located in 
South and Central America. 
Even 
though 
my 
sunny 
home of South Florida sees 
the occasional banana plant 
(which flowers but is not quite 
a tree), it is difficult to produce 
bananas in the majority of 
the United States. By the end 
of the 19th century, the U.S. 
economy 
responded 
to 
the 
domestic demand for bananas 
by importing the fruit from 
the countries where it grew 
naturally. Corporations such 
as United Fruit Company and 
Cuyamel Fruit Company — 
ancestors to the now ubiquitous 
Chiquita banana — established 
strong ties with Latin American 
governments in exchange for 
hefty loans and expansive land 
ownership.
In 
Costa 
Rica 
alone, 
thousands of workers died from 
disease or the effects of a hostile 
climate during the construction 
of infrastructure to support 
the U.S.’s burgeoning banana 
imports. It was during this time 
that the term “banana republic” 
was coined, which refers to a 
country that has an economy 
dependent on the export of a 
single, 
usually 
agricultural, 
good.
At Trader Joe’s in the U.S., 
bananas are priced at 19 cents a 

pop. Meanwhile, for many Latin 
American countries, the export 
of bananas — and the intensive 
manual labor that allows it — 
is economically essential yet 
deeply 
exploitative. 
Banana 
farm workers earn a meager 
living and often face hostile 
environmental and economic 
conditions where they work. 
The tropical heat is brutal 
and the hours are long, and 
Chiquita’s program for workers 
includes a stipulation that if 
they quit or are fired, Chiquita 
can seize their home. Female 
laborers 
often 
face 
sexual 
harassment or threats of rape 
from their superiors, and the 
threat of being fired is often 
sufficient to prevent anyone 
from speaking out or resisting.
For those who work on lower 
rungs of the banana industry 
in 
Latin 
America 
today, 
there is little opportunity for 
redress. 
Labor 
inspections 
are spotty at best, largely 
because government officials 
are overburdened with huge 
caseloads and few financial 
resources. 
Colombia 
even 
closed its Labor Ministry from 
2002 to 2011. 
There is little hope that the 
industry will properly regulate 
itself 
and 
ensure 
human 
rights standards for its own 
workers. In the decades since 
the inception of corporations 
like 
Chiquita, 
organizations 
such as Business for Social 
Responsibility (BSR) have even 
lept at the opportunity to use 
widespread worker abuse for 
profit.
In 
a 
State 
Department-
funded report released during 
the Obama administration, BSR 
analysts chirped about the need 
for “worker empowerment” in 
Honduran banana farms such 
as Finca Tropical. “Plantation 
owners,” 
the 
report 
sagely 
suggests, are often pressured by 
international certifications to 

facilitate a “one-sided discourse 
where managers fail to prompt 
worker participation.” We’re 
looking at a business that 
brands 
itself 
on 
socially-
conscious 
consumerism 
but 
refuses to criticize the evident 
exploitation 
of 
its 
clients’ 
workers.
Perhaps the biggest concern 
that still remains 10 years after 
the report’s release: What does 
a huge corporation like Chiquita 
really do when workers come to 
their managers with a request 
to be paid more than $14 for 
12 hours of high-risk intensive 
labor? 
So, what should we do 
as U.S. consumers? Should 
we 
stop 
eating 
bananas? 
That’s one potential way to 
personally protest the injustice 
that laborers face. Still, the 
individual 
choice 
to 
avoid 
bananas won’t break the supply 
chain or resolve the business 
model that has perpetuated 
exploitation in the first place. 
Maybe I’m biased because I 
really do love bananas, but to 
me, the problem lies not with 
the fruit but the structures that 
commodify and restrict it. 
There 
are 
plenty 
of 
organizations 
that 
are 
passionate 
about 
the 
fight 
against worker abuse, especially 
that which occurs in Latin 
America today. Human rights-
focused 
legal 
organizations 
have engaged in the fight against 
corruption in corporations like 
Chiquita, and many agricultural 
workers do claim membership in 
unions despite their employers’ 
best attempts to silence them. 
Supporting these groups won’t 
promise immediate and perfect 
resolution to the dangers that 
workers face in Latin American 
banana farms, but it is certainly 
a start.

The lasting odyssey of ‘Uncut Gems’

FILM NOTEBOOK

ANDREW WARRICK
Daily Arts Writer

“Everything will be OK” is the kind 
of thing we tell someone when one of 
two situations has occurred: Someone is 
irrationally caught up in a minute problem, 
or everything will absolutely not be OK. Yet, 
the new comedy from Australian comedian 
Josh Thomas (“Please Like Me”) walks a 
thin line between these two situations — 
between being completely helpless and 
being just self aware enough to make it out 
alive — and comes out deftly chock-full of 
heart.
So, their dad is going to die. “Their” is 
three siblings: Nicholas (played by Thomas), 
a slightly hysteric gay kid from Australia 
visiting his father in America, his sister 
Genevieve (Maeve Press, “Evil Lives Here”) 
and their sister Matilda (Kayla Cromer, 
“Blood Orange”), who has autism and 
struggles with social cues. They don’t know 
their dad is going to die at first. But on the 
day that Nicholas is preparing to leave for 
Australia again, his dad (Christopher May, 
“The Hero”) tells him he might not want 
to get on the plane — who is going to take 
care of his sisters? Well, Dad has a list, but 
Nicholas is the obvious choice. Nicholas has 
a lot of issues, clearly; he shared all his issues 
on a date with Alex (Adam Faison, “Grace 

and Frankie”) in one breathless motion. 
Over banana pudding, they all decide that 
Nicholas will take care of the girls even 
though he is, admittedly, not the best choice. 
And then Dad dies, halfway through the 
episode.
One of the things that’s so neat about 
“Everything’s Gonna Be Okay” is how 
candid it is. From the way the father explains 
his situation, to the kids’ reservations about 
Nicholas’s parenting abilities, everything 
is straightforward. In the mode of improv 
comedy, the characters accept events at face-
value, as if none of it is out of the ordinary, 
as if their father isn’t actually dying from 
pancreatic cancer. Even character traits — 
from Nicholas’s sexuality to their father’s 
gross oversight in waiting to tell his children 
for so long that he was going to die — aren’t 
dwelled on. Every character is independent, 
with his or her own self-assured identity.
Perhaps this is helped most by Cromer’s 
stellar performance as Matilda. Cromer 
herself is on the spectrum. The sincere and 
honest treatment of autism on the show is 
a breath of fresh air. It isn’t something that 
gets in the way of the plot, and it doesn’t drag 
characters down. It is simply a component 
of the show, something characters are 
just aware of. Nicholas’s sexuality is 
treated with the same respect. Nothing is 
dwelled on.
They don’t even dwell on their father’s 

death. The funeral is a jovial, slightly 
awkward event, where Nicholas attempts 
to dodge condolences and Matilda delivers 
an unconventional eulogy. When they come 
back to the house, they’re all sad, but not 
because their dad’s dead. Instead they move 
forward, tackling their issues in the moment. 
The episode ends with the siblings dancing 
— Nicholas wants a hug, but Matilda doesn’t 
like hugs. Nicholas and his sisters stuff their 
hands in the condolences bouquets and toss 
the petals into the air, dancing as they fall 
around. And, honestly, everything seems 

‘Everything’s Gonna be OK’ is OK

TV REVIEW

My mom is an art teacher, 
so I’ve had no choice but to be 
surrounded by art my whole 
life. Every family vacation, my 
mom made a point of scoping 
out the nearest art museum and 
marching me and my brother 
through the exhibits. She spent 
hours quizzing us on the likes of 
Claude Monet and Edgar Degas, 
explaining 
the 
differences 
between realism and surrealism 
and putting museum tour guides 
to shame. She skipped the whole 
Disney princess nonsense and 
instead taught me to idolize Frida 
Kahlo and Georgia O’Keeffe. 
When I was in the fifth grade, my 
mom opened her own art studio 
and started a small business 
teaching art classes and hosting 
workshops. The majority of my 
weekends during middle school 
were spent shuffling in and out 
of her studio, watching her teach 
other little girls about Kahlo 
and O’Keeffe. I felt proud to tell 
my friends that my mom owned 
her own business; having that 
space to entertain my creative 
spirit while spending time with 
my mom was a true blessing. 
I quickly grew to love the way 
her studio always smelled of 
turpentine 
and 
constantly 
hosted a gaggle of high-pitched, 
tiny artists-to-be. 
A 
year 
passed, 
and 
as 
the 
aches 
and 
agonies 
of 
adolescence 
commenced, 
my 
mom’s charming little art studio 
didn’t seem so charming to me 
anymore. It was at this same time 
that Instagram was created and 
every middle schooler became a 
content creator overnight. Like 
every other brace-faced girl in 
my sixth grade class, I was quick 
to subscribe to this new age of 
digital art. I began to discover 
the difference between what 
signifies “art” versus what can 
be deemed as “artsy.” It’s those 
two little letters that draw the 
distinction between da Vinci 
and the dreaded VSCO girl. 
Suddenly, art shifted from being 
a central pillar of my relationship 
with my mom to being a vehicle 
for what every adolescent strives 
to do during those hellish years: 
relate to her friends. Overnight, 
there was this new thing on our 
phones that would allow us to 
fabricate and broadcast the lives 
we wished we had. We finally 
had a way of escaping our sad, 
middle-schooler existence. We 
could be popular, we could be 
artsy, as long as our Instagrams 
made us look that way.
Once my friends and I made our 
respective Instagram accounts, 
we began our honorable pursuit 
of artsy excellence measured in 
likes and followers. We would 

make an event out of “getting 
cute,” 
which 
usually 
meant 
sporting something neon from 
Target and going out to exploit 
what little our suburb in central 
Indiana had to offer resembling 
an arts and culture scene. We 
would spend hours weaving in 
and out of our downtown’s brick 
streets, exploring a boutique, 
then an antique store and then 
another 
boutique, 
searching 
for anything that sparked our 
inner artsy. Once that got old, 
we 
would 
venture 
beyond 
the suburb’s Main Street to 
museums in Indianapolis. We 
made a habit out of going to the 
Indianapolis Museum of Art, 
not to actually look at the art, 
but to pose in front of it. We 
would stand in front of countless 
paintings 
and 
sculptures, 
hand on hip, maybe make a 
kissy face and take Instagram 
pictures. This was all in the 
name of converting enduring, 
exceptional pieces of fine art 
into 
something 
we 
deemed 
insta-worthy — of making art 
artsy. The same pieces I saw in 
my mom’s textbooks and heard 
about over and over again in the 
lessons she taught at her studio 
became nothing but background 
visuals to me. 
Over winter break, my two 
best high school friends and 
I returned to the same art 
museum and, luckily, we didn’t 
totally revert to our old habits. 
No kissy-faces were made. We 
saw all the art that we could 
in the 45 minutes before the 
museum 
closed, 
taking 
the 
occasional picture of new pieces 
we saw. We came across the same 
Georgia O’Keeffe exhibit we 
had been going to since middle 
school. We only then realized 
that maybe there’s something 
more to all those flowers and 
pelvis-shaped “animal bones” 
she painted. We let out some 
embarrassed giggles as an old 
couple nearby glared at us. The 
vulvic imagery was suddenly 
screaming at us from the walls 
of the museum. We were seeing 
her art in a whole new way. We 
were seeing it beyond the limits 
of the Instagram filters that had 
once dominated our perspective 
in middle school. 
I’d like to think that moving 
away to college and gaining some 
more life experience allowed me 
to ditch the idea that artistic merit 
and life’s value were measured 
on scales of insta-worthiness. 
But if I know anything for sure, 
it is that while art and artsy-ness 
may carry completely different

About ten minutes into “Uncut Gems,” 
I wondered if I was on drugs. I wasn’t, but 
the symptoms were all there. I couldn’t 
understand much of what was going on, 
but what I did comprehend was completely, 
almost exhaustingly insane. 
The movie began normally enough, with 
a team of Ethiopian miners digging out a 
stone encrusted with colorful opals. The 
camera zoomed in on one of the rock’s 
gems, and it became a cosmic field of 
brilliant, shining colors. Then, somehow, 
the interdimensional lights morphed into 
Adam Sandler’s (“Grown Ups”) colon. As 
the movie continued, its diamond encrusted 
Furbies, swirling synth soundtrack, rapid 
fire dialogue and appearance of The 
Weeknd did nothing to help. 
Maybe, I thought, someone had spiked 
my drink. 
“Uncut Gems” is a wild ride, perhaps the 
craziest of the year. On paper, it’s a simple 
premise: a man wants to make it big by 
auctioning a rare diamond and in doing 
so pay the debtors that threaten him. Yet 
there’s something more to the movie that 
both clouds and colors this simple story, 

giving it a bizarre, cosmic sense of import. 
While it was hard to pin down while I was 
in the theatre, I later realized that I’d seen 
this sort of thing before. 
What other stories take real world events 
and imbue them with crazy, mythological 
twists and turns? Epics, like Dante’s 
Inferno or The Odyssey, do. You’re probably 

thinking something like, “Doesn’t a story 
have to be ancient and fantastical to be an 
epic?” or even “How could you put Adam 
Sandler and epic in the same sentence?” 
However, even with these valid concerns, 
“Uncut Gems” has unquestionably epic 
traits. According to Penlighten, an epic’s 
hero is “a figure of heroic stature or 
national significance” and someone who 
“faces opponents and performs courageous 
deeds that are valued by the nation.” Adam 
Sandler’s Howard Ratner performs this role, 
but instead of winning wars or travelling 
through the underworld like Odysseus or 
Aeneas, he fights in the high-stakes jewel 
market and basketball-gambling circuit. 
While Ratner’s sheer greed may come 
off as heinous, it’s distinctly American. 
American cultural heroes are almost always 
defined by their materialistic desires — 
 
from Jay Gatsby to Kim Kardashian. Ratner 
represents this tenacious drive for cash, 
deemed heroic by mainstream America. 
Like the epic heroes before him, Ratner 
never gives up on his quest, even when 
threatened with torture and death. 
An 
epic 
hero’s 
travels 
encounters 
“supernatural or other worldly forces” 
who “play an active part in the actions of 
the heroic character.” While there are no 
gods, angels or demons in “Uncut Gems,” 
there are plenty of celebrities. I’ve already 
mentioned The Weeknd, but there’s also 
Kevin Garnett playing a version of himself. 
These famous faces are not just camoes. 

In “Uncut Gems,” celebrities are major 
characters that influence the narrative like 
the Greek gods in “The Odyssey” or the 
demons in Dante’s “Inferno.”
If “Uncut Gems” is an epic, one must 
wonder why. What are writer/director duo 
the Safdie brothers doing by using this 
convention? After the film, I realized that 
our culture has swapped epic battlefields 
fought by soldiers in golden armor with 
casinos populated by people in gold chains. 
Gods too have been replaced by their 
modern equivalents — sports and movie 
stars. 
As much as we like to pretend we’re 
more civilized in 2020, that the cell phone 
has replaced the scroll, certain things will 
always be the same. Money changes hands, 
battles are fought and people die. Yet 
there’s still love, comedy and victory. A day 
in the life of humanity is a spectrum that 
runs from heinous to holy. Most stories take 
a stance, portraying the world as black and 
white, or one of the two, and choose genres 
with neat, clear borders that make the world 
simpler. Epics, however, embrace life’s 
moral chaos and its endless contradictions. 
They take what is most beautiful, ugly, 
exciting and boring and paint a cosmic yet 
simultaneously down-to-earth portrait of 
the human race unlike any other narrative. 
While the form is centuries old, “Uncut 
Gems” proves that it still has centuries left. 
All I can do is hope that the next one has just 
a little more diamond-encrusted Furbies.

The blurb on the back of Tarryn 
Fisher’s “The Wives” describes the book 
as “shocking” and “twisted.” I can’t help 
but agree. I was so “shocked” by the 
ending that I must’ve read the last two 
pages several times just to understand 
how “The Wives” went from a delicious 
thriller to something resembling a low-
budget Lifetime movie. 
“The Wives” is written from the 
perspective of Thursday, a young nurse 
living in Seattle. Early on, we learn that 
Seth, Thursday’s husband, visits her 
every Thursday (a point of confusion for 
me because I assumed her nickname was 
Thursday). On Monday and Tuesday, he 
visits his other wives. Legally, Seth is not 
married to these other women, but he’s 

their husband in every other sense of the 
word. Thursday is initially compliant 
with this strange relationship. You see, 
she’s aware that Seth has other wives, 
recognizing that Seth must get his other 
needs (i.e. a baby) fulfilled by another 
woman. In fact, she willingly competes 
against Monday and Tuesday, as if their 
polygamy were merely a bizarre episode 
of “The Bachelor.” She dubs Tuesday as 
Seth’s first “selfish” wife, jabbing at her 
inability to cook and even jokingly asking 
Seth one night if it was “Pizza for dinner 
again?” Thursday, in contrast, revels in 
her mastery of the kitchen, a skill that 
she views as making her a better wife. 
In the first chapter, we get a glimpse 
into the “picturesque” side of Thursday 
and Seth’s marriage — Thursday’s lavish 
dinner (a juicy rack of lamb served with 
oranges and cream), a back-and-forth 

of flirty banter and a night of hot sex. 
I was hooked. I wanted to see their 
precariously-held relationship crumble. 
I wanted the cat-fights between Monday, 
Tuesday and Thursday. I wanted the 
dark secrets to resurface. Because 
while Thursday is aware of Seth’s other 
wives, she doesn’t know who they are. 
Thursday’s happenstance finding of 
a carefully folded piece of paper in 
Seth’s jacket with an appointment for 
“Hannah” takes the readers on a journey 
that circumvents everything we thought 
we knew. 
Devoid of flowery prose, the blunt 
writing style made it easy for readers 
to get reeled into the mind of Thursday. 
There were no lengthy paragraphs, no 
heavy themes to dissect. Reading “The 
Wives” was like listening to the ravings 
of that one eccentric friend. I found 

myself questioning time and again, 
who’s telling the truth? Thursday… or 
Seth? “The Wives”’ restriction to just 
the perspective of Thursday intensifies 
mystery and thrill at the expense of a 
carefully plotted novel. 
On 
paper, 
“The 
Wives” 
had 
everything that I would normally find 
enticing: a dark, sexy relationship, long 
(almost pornographic) descriptions of 
food, a mound of buried secrets and 
a jaw-dropping twist. Except for the 
relationship (and maybe the food, but 
I’m picky!), the rest of the cliches weren’t 
quite as well executed. The climax comes 
a little too early and it’s a dumpster fire 
of twist after twist revelations as if we’re 
watching a parody of a dramatic unmask. 
Wait… it was actually ME this whole 
time! The latter half of “The Wives” 
does a disservice to the slow-burning 

thrill of the first. I kept reading with 
morbid curiosity, hoping my terrible 
predictions didn’t come true. It was 
worse than I could’ve imagined. My 
brain was a scrambled mess when I 
reached the final “twist” and “shocking” 
conclusion. Above all, I was confused 
and disappointed. “The Wives” had set 
the stage for an expert psychological 
thriller. A novel that could’ve explored 
the innermost darkness of the human 
psyche. Instead, “The Wives” relied on 
cheap thrills to get to the finish line.
While I wasn’t satisfied with the 
ending of “The Wives,” I still enjoyed the 
book. After a month-long reading hiatus 
(yes, I know. I’m disappointed with 
myself too), “The Wives” succeeded in its 
promise as “a thriller you won’t be able 
to put down!” I finished this book in one 
sitting, dying to know the ending.

‘The Wives’ is a standard thriller but hard to finish

I couldn’t understand 
much of what was

did comprehend was

kids’ reservations 
about Nicholas’s 
parenting abilities, 
everything is 
straightforward.

Kate Wisel and her love letter to fiction at Literati

My friend glared at me when I told her Kate 
Wisel’s collection of stories was about violence 
against women. Other women don’t often like 
to hear those two words together — violence 
and women. Especially on a Friday night. I had 
promised my friend a cozy outing to our favorite 
coffee shop, a charming end to a not-so-charming 
first full week of classes. She hadn’t expected 
the reading to be so morbid. Nevertheless, we 
sat ourselves down towards the back of the less-
than-full audience of bookworms on that bitter 
winter night. We sipped our chai lattes, noses 
still sniffling from the cold, as a man with a stern 
expression introduced the young author.
I am a self-proclaimed lover of Literati. I love 
its walls scribbled with pensive literary remarks 
and its bountiful offering of espresso drinks. I 
was excited to attend the event, which was part 
of Literati’s ongoing “Fiction at Literati” series. 
The night included a reading by author Kate Wisel 
from her book Driving in Cars with Homeless Men 
followed by a conversation with fiction writer and 
essayist Brad Felver. The coffee shop’s normal 
grouping of tables and benches was reconfigured 

to make way for about five rows of black bentwood 
chairs. Though the event was admittedly low 
in attendance — my friend and I were joined 
by an older couple and a few lone silver-haired 
bibliophiles — Literati’s tranquil atmosphere and 
quaint ambiance did not disappoint. All of us 
Literati and literary lovers successfully escaped 
the biting Michigan cold and sat before a petite 
young woman with a voice sweet as honey. She 
introduced her work by comparing the linked 
stories to a “pool table,” with the characters’ 
plotlines crashing into one another as the book 
progresses. She began the reading with a section 
from the chapter titled “Trouble,” which is told 
from the perspective of Serena, one of the central 
narrators. 
Wisel advertises her book as “a love letter to 
women moving through violence;” the work is 
a collection of stories that all take place in the 
varied settings of working-class Boston. Through 
her pool-table architectural style, Wisel takes the 
reader on a journey through time and space, which, 
as Felver described in his formal conversation with 
her, lends to a disorienting reading experience. 
With this style, Wisel says she is able to encourage 
a more interactive author-reader dynamic rather 
than having the reader be “picked up [by the 
author] like a toddler and carried” through a story.

She also makes a point to pepper humor 
throughout the book as an outlet to convey 
the frustration and anger experienced by the 
affected women. Her first reading of “Trouble” 
spoke to this writing tactic: Serena, the character 
narrating the story, compares the yapping of her 
dog to a “Mormon girl [being kidnapped]” and 
makes repeated jabs at her neighbor couple’s 
matching lazy eyes. As Serena’s narrative went 
on to include several more colorful details, Wisel 
got some muttered chuckles from the audience. 
I particularly enjoyed the way she described the 
character’s dog as having a “coal-lined eye like an 
emo teenager.” Wisel goes on to reveal that Serena 
got the dog as a gift from her partner — a kind of 
“sorry for making you bleed” peace offering. The 
imagery Wisel employs to allude to the women’s 
experiences with domestic violence was poignant 
yet palatable, effective in its ability to make me 
and my friend grimace with discontent. In the first 
reading of “Troubled,” Serena’s abuse is illustrated 
through details describing her and her home’s 
physical state: her swollen eye, a bloody floor, a 
shattered mirror. There was no explicit narration 
of the abusive events Serena was experiencing. 
The second story was once again told from 
Serena’s perspective and as Wisel alluded to in the 
conversation that followed her reading, jumped 

in time from the first story. In the second section, 
Serena is working as a flight attendant, traveling 
miles and miles and basking in a sky-bound 
existence away from her abusive partner.
After the reading and conversation with Felver, 
the two authors opened up for questions from the 
audience. Wisel received a few questions about 
her unique architectural style and her method for 
approaching such a sensitive topic like domestic 
violence with humor and transparency. We got 
to learn a little bit about the thought process 
she employs when constructing sentences as she 
explained how she leans into the natural rhythm of 
what’s jumbled inside her head, ultimately giving 
her writing a lyrical quality. Wisel answered all 
of the audience’s questions with humility and 
bubbliness as she cracked jokes about the quirky 
journey writing a book can be. She made it sound 
as though she did not approach her book with a 
concrete plan, but rather let the women’s stories 
develop naturally on the page. 
After a handful of questions, the event officially 
ended and the audience members dispersed, one 
by one, going on to explore the rest of the warm 
bookstore. My friend and I left, minds bustling 
with thoughts of puppies and lazy eyes and hearts 
aching with a dull pain for women like Serena, 
bruised and bloodied and confined to Wisel’s page.

Hearne’s ‘Word for Word’ and what it means to create

This past weekend, I happened upon an old 
recording of composer Ted Hearne’s “Word for Word” 
for large orchestra. In the interest of full disclosure, I 
should note that the piece was premiered by the New 
York Youth Symphony in 2011 under the direction of 
Paul Haas, a former composition teacher of mine. 
Hearne is known for his unconventional use of form 
and organization of time. His string orchestra work, 
the “Law of Mosaics,” is one of my favorite pieces. 
Its opening movement, “Excerpts from the middle 
of something,” contains wide swathes of silence. In 
between these bouts of silence are intriguing complex 
soundworlds; the lack of connecting material between 
these worlds gives the movement its unique flavor.
In “Word for Word,” however, Hearne experiments 
not with silence and chronology but with the very 
meaning of creativity. He takes simple, two-measure 
orchestral figures that he claims “could have been 
ripped from a piece of orchestral music from the 19th 
century” and repeatedly distorts them using nothing 
but a music notation program’s copy-paste feature.
He does not evolve this material in the “traditional” 

compositional sense. He offers no other musical 
ideas in the first movement that might evolve this 
opening material. For many of the orchestral parts, 
he does nothing but repeat the material with different 
rhythmic offsets. Nevertheless, he plays the role of 
“composer” in the piece, creating the notation that 
produces the synchronous vibrations of air we refer 
to as music.
As I began to think more about this piece, I ran 
into a question of creative autonomy. Had Hearne 
composed the piece, or was he aided by his computer’s 
copy-paste feature? Is there a point at which 
creativity becomes overly reliant on technology — a 
point at which a creator must credit technology as a 
co-creator of a work?
In this specific piece, it was the fact that Hearne 
had composed the underlying copy-pasted material 
that lead me to conclude that he was the sole creator 
of the work. Though this material is 19th-century-
esque, a close reading of Hearne’s program note 
indicates that it is his original music. But what if this 
were not the case?
For this I turned to another movement of Hearne’s 
“Law of Mosaics” for string orchestra: “Climactic 
movements from ‘Adagio for Strings’ and ‘The Four 
Seasons’,” slowed down and layered on top of one 

another.” For those familiar with these two works, 
the movement’s musical material is painfully obvious. 
It is nothing but the climactic section of the “Adagio 
for Strings” and a large, tutti section of “The Four 
Seasons,” with both pieces slowed down considerably. 
I found myself asking, yet again, whether Hearne 
was really the sole composer, or creator, of this 
movement. In this instance, the answer seemed much 
more ambiguous. He was definitely the first composer 
to notate these pieces slowed down at such a rate and 
packed on top of each other in such a way. But he was 
not the first composer to create these melodies, pitch 
classes, or relative durations.
This problem, I realized, is also intimately related 
to modern technology. Thanks to contemporary 
music notation programs, streaming services and 
public domain sheet music websites, composers 
have the ability to view, listen to and emulate other 
composers’s music like never before. 
To complicate things further, I would ascribe 
much of the meta-musical meaning I interpret from 
Hearne’s piece to relate to this modern technology. 
I think that his piece deals with our post-modern, 
allegedly post-factual age. As much as modern 
visual imagery is repeatedly recontextualized and 
decontextualized at the hands of memes, Hearne is 

able to strip two staples of the string orchestra canon 
of their normal musical meaning.
I began asking myself if my preconceptions about 
the role of a creator in an artistic work were thus 
somehow outdated. Perhaps this is no longer a valid 
means of understanding art and the artists that make 
it. Perhaps other realms of the performing arts had 
already evolved past this and classical music was slow 
to catch up.
In rap music, for example, I knew that many 
producers 
relied 
on 
sampling 
to 
generate 
accompanimental material. While the rapper wrote 
and performed entirely new material, the producer 
merely manipulated and organized music written by 
others — the role of the creative producer, I would 
argue, had been replaced with the musical curator.
But then I asked myself what had prevented other 
composers from doing exactly what Hearne had 
done or what many of these producers do. (This is 
an argument I’ve frequently heard applied to John 
Cage’s “4’33”” to great effect.) If Hearne’s work 
wasn’t creative, what had prevented others from pre-
empting Hearne in his non-creative efforts?

‘It extends further than lacrosse’

Playing 
against 
the 
best 
atheletes of your sport at the 
Division I level is daunting.
Playing in a starting role as a 
freshman — even more daunting.
But when attackman Bryce 
Clay and defenseman Andrew 
Darby both found themselves 
in the starting lineup for the 
Michigan men’s lacrosse team 
against Drexel last Februrary 
— the second game of their 
freshman season — they had 
little to fear.
They knew their teammates 
and coaches had their backs.
“I wasn’t nervous ... I leaned a 
lot on my seniors, because those 
guys have been there before,” 
Darby said. “They (knew) what 
to do.”
All Clay and Darby needed was 
to relax and do what they came to 
Michigan to do — play lacrosse. 
They did just that. 
In the final minutes of the 
third quarter, Clay netted his 
first goal as a Wolverine and 
picked up four ground balls. 
Darby scooped up three ground 
balls of his own and caused one 
turnover.
Despite 
a 
deflating 
17-16 
double-overtime 
loss 
to 
the 
Dragons, there was a positive 
silver lining — Clay and Darby 
had emerged as starters.
***
Despite their age, Clay and 
Darby weren’t nervous.
For one thing, they had earned 
the right to play at a high-caliber 
level.
Clay, 
ranked 
as 
the 
No. 
11 
attackman 
amongst 
2018 
recruits, was a two-time USILA 
high school All-American during 
his time at Forest Hills Central 
High School in Grand Rapids, 
MI. Darby hails from Darien, 
Conn. — a hotbed for east-coast 
lacrosse — and was named First-
Team All-Connecticut during his 
senior season.
“We had to go ahead and 
throw them in positions that 

they needed to be thrust into,” 
Michigan coach Kevin Conry 
said.
Added Darby: “I’d make sure 
I hit the wall at least three times 
a week in-season just to get my 
reps in and make sure I wouldn’t 
drop 
that 
extra 
pass. 
Just 
working hard, trying to learn the 
defense, trusting my coaches and 
the older guys.”
But the deeper reason behind 
Clay and Darby’s early success 
lies in a positive team culture 
that permeates throughout the 
Wolverines’ entire roster.
Some college sports teams 
are toxic and self-destructive, 
overemphasizing 
individual 
success and accolades.
But some are imbued with 
camaraderie, support and an 
overwhelming sense of pride. 
These teams value synergy and 
build one another up.
Michigan men’s lacrosse is 
among the latter. 
“Something 
coach 
Conry 
harps on is setting an example 
on and off the field,” Darby said. 
“You can’t just turn on a switch 
for big games. You have to be 
dialed in at practice and off the 
field everyday — go to class 
everyday.”
***
Last season, Clay and Darby 
had some pretty good role models 
to follow. 
On a roster anchored by several 
current 
professional 
lacrosse 
players, including the program’s 
all-time 
leading 
goal-scorer, 
midfielder Brent Noseworthy, 
and defenseman Nick DeCaprio, 
who led the Big Ten in caused 
turnovers per game last season, 
the Wolverines were able to 
use their veteran leadership to 
cultivate the development of the 
program’s future leaders.
Joining 
an 
offensive 
core 
led by Noseworthy, midfielder 
Decker 
Curran 
and 
fellow 
attackmen Kevin Mack and Alex 
Buckanavage, Clay found himself 
in exceptional company to help 
elevate his game. He quickly 
became an offensive weapon for 

Michigan, finishing the season 
third on the team in goals (22) 
and fifth in total points (28). 
During a four-game stretch in the 
middle season when Noseworthy 
was out with a knee injury, Clay 
stepped up, scoring 10 goals and 
recording three assists.
“A lot of my success last 
year was from my teammates, 
whether it was them giving me 
the ball or me giving them the 
ball,” Clay said. “They helped me 
get to the right places. I was just 
a kid. Whenever I was stressed 
out or not having a good day, 
they made sure I was alright and 
putting in the extra work.”
An experienced defensive unit, 
led by then seniors DeCaprio 
and Michael Borda, provided an 
opportunity for Darby to grow 
as well. By the end of the season, 
he had picked up the third-most 
ground balls on the team (29) 
and caused 13 turnovers.

“Defense is a big team sport,” 
Darby said. “You have to rely a 
lot on your team ... Just having 
an open mind and being able to 
learn was the big key for me.”
And off the field, whether 
it was working on homework, 
team-bonding or finding time 
to get meals together, seniors 
made sure to help younger 
players adjust to the lifestyle of a 
Division I athlete.
“Last year (Noseworthy) was 
a great influence on me,” Clay 
said. “He’s a great guy, great 
teammate. (He’s) somebody I 
could go to outside of lacrosse ... 
It’s nice having that.”
Added Darby: “If you’re having 
a bad day, not everyone is having 
a bad day, so you have to rely on 
your teammates to help you get 
better and keep you positive.”
Although 
their 
roads 
to 
Ann Arbor have been vastly 
different, 
both 
Clay 
and 

Darby have found a home on the 
Wolverines’ roster thanks to the 
demonstrated care of their older 
teammates.
***
As a lacrosse player from 
western 
Michigan 
in 
Grand 
Rapids, Clay had to spend his 
childhood summers at lacrosse 
tournaments on the east coast 
just to get attention from college 
recruiters. 
When 
Michigan 
called to offer Clay a scholarship 
to 
play 
lacrosse, 
it 
was 
a 
no-brainer for him to commit.
However, Clay had to put in 
a significant amount of work 
to adjust to the pace of college 
lacrosse.
“The Big Ten is super fast ... 
With 
lacrosse 
predominantly 
being an east coast sport, I really 
had to speed up quick and (the 
team) helped me transition,” Clay 
said. “(But) I realized that it’s 
bigger than myself to represent 
the Block ‘M.’ I know that when I 
leave here, I’ll be a better person. 
I’ll be a Michigan man. That was 
big for me.”
Darby, on the other hand, 
played for a high school crowded 
with talent where competition 
for playing time was fierce. After 
not playing on varsity until his 
senior year at Darien, Michigan 
posed as a unique opportunity 
for Darby to showcase his true 
abilities at the college level.
“That made me get better and 
I learned from a lot of guys ahead 
of me at (Darien),” Darby said. 
“It just made me better in the 
long-run ... my (motto) of getting 
here was, ‘trust the process.’ 
Everything (happened) for a 
reason.”
***
But now older teammates like 
Noseworthy and DeCaprio are 
gone. Entering their sophomore 
seasons, Clay and Darby bear 
a greater burden to fill their 
shoes as impact players and role 
models. 
Following 
a 
disappointing 
4-9 season plagued by injuries 
and faceoff struggles, it wasn’t 
a perfect season for the young 
pair. Like everyone on the team, 

they made mistakes. But Conry 
hopes his decision to place 
them in a starting role early in 
their collegiate careers will pay 
dividends. 
“They were baptized in fire. 
(We said) ‘Let’s get (them) in and 
have them make some mistakes 
now, so (they) can be better,’ ” 
Conry said. “It’s creating a map 
for their future.”
Clay and Darby have their 
eyes set on the upcoming 2020 
campaign, with hopes to build 
off the Wolverines’ victory over 
Ohio State in last year’s season 
finale — their first win against 
the Buckeyes in program history.
“One thing we learned was 
that we hate to lose,” Darby said. 
“It was not fun. So we built up 
that hatred for losing.”
Added Clay: “I’m expecting 
some bigger things ... we are 
grown-ups now. We have some 
experience out there. Just to 
compete at a high level is huge to 
set an example for the younger 
guys coming in and represent the 
Block ‘M.’ ”
When Michigan opens its 
season against Cleveland State 
in February, Clay and Darby will 
once again be in the starting 
lineup. 
Conry and the rest of the team 
will expect them to build off of 
last year’s production.
But off the field, the program 
will expect arguably more of 
them to serve as leaders for the 
young Wolverines roster.
“They are guys who we know 
are going to be in the shooting 
room, doing extra footwork, 
going to be monsters in the weight 
room,” Conry said. “We want 
guys who meet our standards 
and carry their teammates along 
with their standards,” Conry 
said.“Now that they have gotten 
to a point where they have 
consistently met our standards 
for our program ... they are doing 
a good job dragging people along 
with them.”
“It 
extends 
further 
than 
lacrosse,” Clay said. “Lacrosse is 
a big part of our lives, but we are 
trying to be better men.”

With Kayla Robbins out, Danielle Rauch gives Wolverines valuable minutes

Just one minute into Sunday’s 
game against Nebraska, senior 
forward Kayla Robbins went 
down with an ugly-looking injury, 
later determined to be a torn ACL 
which would end her season.
For the Michigan women’s 
basketball team, everything else in 
that moment paled in comparison 
to the health of its second leading 
scorer and captain. But after an 
emotional break in the game’s 
action, 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes Arico was faced with the 
difficult decision of how to replace 
Robbins’ minutes.
The Wolverines’ two starting 
wings — Robbins and senior 
Akienreh Johnson — both averaged 
over 27 minutes per game entering 
Sunday, and neither had missed a 
game all season. As a result, none 
of Michigan’s bench wings had 
played extended minutes against a 
power conference opponent.

Barnes Arico’s choice to fill 
Robbins’ role was sophomore 
guard Danielle Rauch. Rauch — 
typically the backup point guard 
to sophomore Amy Dilk — hadn’t 
played more than nine minutes in 
a Big Ten game. Sunday, she was 
called upon for 32. 
And she made the 
most of them.
While Rauch’s 
offensive 
contributions 
were 
a 
step 
down 
from 
what 
Robbins 
usually 
gives 
the 
Wolverines 
— five points to 
Robbins’ 
per-
game average of 
11.6 — she played smart and did 
what the team needed her to do. 
She took care of the ball, with zero 
turnovers, and looked to distribute 
when she didn’t have a shot, giving 
opportunities to Michigan’s more 
dynamic scorers.

“I didn’t realize how much she 
had played in the game until I 
looked at the stat sheet,” Johnson 
said. “She looked like she was a 
person that averaged 30 minutes. 
She never got tired. She was 
talking consistently, doing a great 
job on offense and 
defense.”
With 
three 
minutes left in 
the game, Dilk 
fouled 
out 
and 
the Cornhuskers 
made both free 
throws to extend 
their 
lead 
to 
seven, in a game 
that was tied just 
three 
minutes 
earlier. It seemed 
that the loss of Dilk was the nail 
in the coffin to the Wolverines’ 
chances of pulling out a win.
But 
Rauch 
wouldn’t 
let 
Michigan go down so easily. 
On the ensuing possession, she 
drained a 3-pointer and yelled to 

the bench, giving the Wolverines 
life. Two possessions later, she 
found sophomore forward Naz 
Hillmon in the paint for a layup. 
On the next one, she dished it out 
to junior forward Hailey Brown, 
who knocked down a 3-pointer 
that cut the Nebraska lead to 
three. 
Michigan would end up losing 
by three, but Rauch kept them in 
the game until the final possession, 
even after it seemed out of reach 
just minutes earlier.
To onlookers, Rauch’s high-
quality 32 minutes may have 
been 
a 
surprise 
given 
her 
previous playing time, but to 
those inside the program, it was 
the expectation. Her teammates 
consistently describe her as one 
of the hardest-working players 
on the team — the type of player 
who is constantly in the gym on 
off days, putting up tons of shots 
to put herself in a position to 
contribute when needed.
“I just think that I train 

the same way all the time 
to be prepared for whatever 
opportunity that I’m given,” 
Rauch said. “On any given night 
I don’t know if it’s gonna be 
three minutes, 10 minutes or 30 
minutes. Always prepare yourself 
for whatever opportunity you’re 
gonna get.”
Both Johnson and Rauch made 
it clear: Nobody can replace 

Robbins, but Michigan’s season 
doesn’t end without her. Players 
who haven’t been asked to do 
much more than play smart for 
short spurts with a starter on 
the bench will have to put points 
on the board and contribute for 
extended periods of time.
Rauch’s play on Sunday gave 
the Wolverines confidence that 
they found one of those players.

Pearson’s vision coming true

In sports, positive messages 
about resilience and perseverance 
have 
become 
the 
staple 
of 
struggling teams.
Yet such optimism often falls 
short. Out of all the teams that 
pledge to stick with it, trust the 
process, work 
hard 
and 
improve each 
day to make 
a midseason 
comeback, 
only 
a 
handful will 
see 
such 
promises 
come 
to 
fruition.
With such 
positive statements, it can be 
hard to accurately predict how a 
team will actually respond. It’s 
difficult to separate fact from 
fiction, hard to know who’s 
just talking and who genuinely 
believes that they’ll change their 
fate midseason.
Looking back, though, brings 
the necessary clarity. And it’s now 
crystal clear that there was truth 
behind Mel Pearson’s optimism 
during the Michigan hockey 
team’s early season struggles.
***
It was a Monday in mid-
November, 
late 
afternoon. 
Practice had ended a short while 
back, and Pearson sat down in 
a dark blue, leather chair in the 
lobby of the hockey offices at Yost 
to field questions from a group of 
reporters, as he often does.
There was a certain element 
of repetitiveness to the ensuing 
conversation. 
For 
the 
third 
weekend in a row, Michigan 
had widely underperformed its 
expectations. 
The 
Wolverines 
had just been swept by Michigan 
State, including a home loss in 
which they blew a two-goal 
lead. They were on a seven-
game winless streak that began 
in Kalamazoo against Western 
Michigan. 
Through 
three 
weekends of conference play, 
Michigan had tallied just one out 
of a possible 18 points.
“For the most part, they’re 

playing pretty well. And it will 
come,” Pearson said that day. 
“There’s two ways you can go. You 
can just feel sorry for yourself, 
you can sulk, you can start 
complaining. … Or you can just 
continue to work hard, continue 
to support each other and just 
trust in the process. They’re the 
latter.”
Pearson went on to cover the 
importance of focusing on things 
you can control. The weather that 
Monday was quite pleasant. The 
sun shined brightly, bringing a 
blanket of warmth atypical of a 
November day and providing the 
coach with a perfect example to 
further explain his mantra.
“You guys can’t control the 
weather out there today, right?” 
Pearson asked. “Did you call 
somebody out and say ‘I want a 
sunny day today’? No, you can’t … 
There’s so many things you can’t 
control.”
He mentioned that attitude 
is 
controllable, 
though, 
and 
that the Wolverines would just 
have to stay positive and avoid 
complaining.
“I’m going to be different and 
have a good attitude,” Pearson 
said. “And know that the sun is 
going to come out at some point 
for us, and when it does it’s going 
to be beautiful.”
***

Michigan’s 
recent 
success 
would’ve 
seemed 
somewhat 
unfathomable earlier this season. 
The Wolverines are coming off 
two stellar weekends on the road, 
in which they swept then-No. 14 
Notre Dame and earned five of six 
points against then-No. 6 Penn 
State.
To Pearson, it has been a 
gradual comeback. It started 
with the three series following 
the one against the Spartans in 
November. Michigan split all 
three — against New Hampshire, 
Wisconsin and the Nittany Lions 
— and started to find its footing.
Now thinking back, Pearson 
can bring perspective to his team’s 
rebirth and why he believed in it 
during the tough times.
“You know as a coach,” Pearson 
said this week. “You know when 
you have something and you’ve 
got a chance and some things are 
just working against you. And you 
know when you are just horse 
shit, when you have no chance.”
The Wolverines are finally 
playing with some moxy. They’ve 
convinced themselves that this 
is who they truly are and this is 
what they’ve always been capable 
of. 
Through 
Pearson’s 
eyes, 
the 
team 
that 
suffered 
the 
rough stretch early on was still 
scrambling to find its identity. 

Now, Michigan has found that 
identity in its defense.
“That’s the bread and butter. 
And I told the team after the 
Friday night game at Penn State, 
‘Hey I’m happy about the six 
goals, but what I really like is the 
goose egg, the zero,’ ” Pearson said 
of the 6-0 victory. “Because some 
nights as we’ve seen in the first 
half the puck is not always going 
to go in for you. But if you play 
solid defensively and don’t give 
anything up then you’re going to 
be right there. You’re going to be 
in every game and we have been. 
I think that’s the foundation on 
which you build upon. 
“They’ve bought into that now. 
They understand that.”
Now 
for 
the 
Wolverines, 
it’s all about maintaining that 
success through the remainder 
of the regular season to help their 
postseason aspirations.
“I’m not going to say we’re 
going to run through and go 8-2 
here in the second half, but we 
have a chance,” Pearson said. “We 
have a chance to win every game, 
and that’s all you can ask for.”
In other words, Pearson is 
staying positive as before. The 
past two weekends justify that, 
little by little. It paid off the first 
time.
Maybe, just maybe, the sun will 
come out again.

‘M’ tops three-way meet

Junior 
sprinter 
Vail 
Hartman made the final turn 
in the 4-by-400 men’s relay 
with a comfortable lead. His 
teammates, 
senior 
Desmond 
Melson, sophomore Ian Davis 
and senior Alex Schwedt helped 
Michigan built a sizeable lead, 
but it was Hartman who the 
Wolverines entrusted as their 
anchor. As he leaned into the 
finish line, with only empty 
track in his wake, a roar erupted 
from 
the 
2,000 
maize-and-
blue dressed fans around him, 
providing a truly cinematic 
finale to the meet. 
Michigan track and field made 
it look easy all afternoon as they 
swept the Buckeyes and the 
Spartans in the Simmons-Harvey 
Invitational. 
The 
Wolverines 
walked away with a win in 
both the men’s and women’s 
divisions, finishing first in half 
of the 30 events combined. The 
women’s team won by 27 points 
over the second-place Buckeyes 
and third-place Spartans, while 
the men’s team won by 13 points 
over second-place Ohio State and 
third-place Michigan State. 
“It gives you a sense of a 
championship — Big Ten — 
because it’s Ohio State and 
Michigan 
State,” 
Michigan 
coach James Henry said. “Those 
are the teams that you want to 
beat. It gave us a Big Ten flavor. 
The intensity was there and 
that’s what we wanted.” 
Senior distance runner Meg 
Darmofal felt that intensity as 
she won the women’s mile race. 
She won by over two seconds 
with a time of 4:46 — a career 
best and the fifth-fastest time in 
college this year. 
Six laps in, Darmofal was a 
part of the pack, but then made 
her move and got up to the second 
spot 
behind 
her 
teammate, 
senior Annie Taylor. In the final 
lap, Darmofal continued to lay 
it all out, passing her teammate. 
Spartans’ 
distance 
runner 
Annie Fuller climbed her way 
to behind Darmofal, forming 
an All-American battle. But in 
the last 200 meters, Darmofal’s 

speed accelerated her away from 
Fuller and into the first-place 
finish. 
“I was trying to get position 
throughout the race,” Darmofal 
said. “Then my teammate made 
a move in the last quarter of it 
and got things rolling … so I just 
kicked it and went for the win.” 
The Wolverines, as a whole, 
followed 
Darmofal’s 
words 
competing in a different gear 
throughout the events.
In the men’s 800-meter race, 
Michigan filled out the top 
five. The five runners followed 
sophomore 
distance 
runner 
Derrick Simmons’ hot start 
out of the gate and used that 
momentum to triumph in the 
race. Sophomore distance runner 
Cole Johnson finished first with 
a time of 1:51. Freshman distance 
runner Nick Foster, Simmons, 
senior distance runner Ben Hill 
and freshman distance runner 
Thomas Shilgalis didn’t finish 
far behind — all within a second 
of Johnson. 
“To finish top five and have 
your teammates right there 
running with you is an awesome 
feeling,” Johnson said. 
Records — personal, school-
wide and league-wide — were 
a major theme of the meet. No 
one can attest to that more 
than senior thrower Andrew 
Liskowitz. He launched the 
five farthest throws in school 
history, three of them being 
over 20-meters. Liskowitz’s top 
throw went for 20.29 meters, 
which stands as the second 
farthest shot-put throw in the 
NCAA this year. 
“I think today has been a good 
reflection of how my training 
has been going,” Liskowitz said. 
“(I’m) working hard and eating 
right. Pretty happy with that.” 
The 
Wolverine 
athletes’ 
events went their way Saturday 
and the results of the meet 
exemplified their success. 
“The momentum flew in our 
directions because of the home 
field advantage that we had,” 
Henry said. “We wanted to take 
advantage of that. It was nice 
to see our team come together 
and cheer each other on from 
beginning to end.”

ALEC COHEN/Daily
Michigan coach Mel Pearson is seeing the fruits of his persistent optimism in the Wolverines’ recent hot streak.

TRACK AND FIELD

State of despair

The ball started in Lamar 
Stevens’ hands, as the Michigan 
men’s basketball team expected.
The senior forward has been 
a key cog of Penn State’s offense 
since he stepped foot on campus in 
2016. So when the first possession 
of the Wolverines’ 72-63 loss to 
Penn State (14-5 overall, 4-4 Big 
Ten) ended with Stevens posting 
up, nobody was surprised.
With 
sophomore 
forward 
Brandon Johns Jr. at his back, he 
faked toward the paint, spun the 
other way and knocked down a 
fadeaway from baseline.
On the next possession, he 
sank a three from the wing. The 
one after that ended with him 
converting a mid-range jumper. 
Before long, Stevens’ hot start put 
Michigan (11-7, 2-5) in a 9-2 hole, 
forcing coach Juwan Howard to 
burn a timeout.
And as his team trotted back to 
the bench, what Howard saw was 
a fitting prelude to the rest of the 
night.
“I saw some guys had a little 
doubt in their eyes,” Howard said. 
“And that’s not how we have to 
approach games, especially when 
we’re playing at home.”
When Stevens exited the floor 
shortly after, the Wolverines made 
the most of the opportunity. As 
Stevens watched from the bench, 
junior guard Eli Brooks knocked 
down a corner three that sparked 
a 11-0 run. He added another five 
points during the spurt.
Stevens sat for fewer than two 
minutes, but it was enough to 
give Michigan the lead. Shortly 
after he checked back into the 
game, though, Penn State scored 
14 unanswered points over a 
six-minute stretch that saw the 
Wolverines commit five turnovers.
And in a matter of minutes, a 
game that had already been flipped 
on its head took another sharp 
turn.
Once again, Michigan had 

plenty of opportunities to retake 
the reins after it fell behind. The 
Wolverines couldn’t cash in this 
time, missing 14 of their 19 shots 
away from the rim in the first half.
Between Michigan’s shooting 
woes and Stevens’ lack thereof, 
Penn State took a 37-28 lead into 
halftime.
The second half began with a 
similar script. Coming out of the 
locker room, Penn State went on a 
7-3 run as the Wolverines missed 
seven of their first eight field 
goal attempts. While Michigan’s 
open looks repeatedly clanked off 
the back iron, the Nittany Lions 
extended their lead to as much as 
15.
Through it all, the Wolverines’ 
defense was as quiet as it’s been all 
season.
“It’s too late in the season for, 
you know, I have to beg our guys 
to communicate on defense,” 
Howard said. “Not just on the 
defensive end, on the offensive end, 
too. It just so happens it’s a lost art 
in the game and we have to bring it 
back.
“Yes, I’m old school, but in 
order for us to forge ahead and 
move 
forward 
and 
improve, 
communication has to be a part of 
the process. That is surprising that 
some of our guys don’t like talking 
on defense. … There’s a lot of 
guessing going on, and I just don’t 
understand it.”
With Michigan in dire need 
of a spark, freshman wing Franz 
Wagner jumped in front of a pass 
along the perimeter. As he chased 
the deflected ball in transition for 
what looked like an imminent open 
dunk, a Nittany Lion defender 
grabbed hold of his arm.
The blaring sound of a whistle 
pierced through Crisler Center, 
and the unconventional intentional 
foul call ensued. Wagner sank both 
free throws, which proved to be the 
first of eight unanswered points for 
the Wolverines — a stretch that 
trimmed the deficit to just five.
But as the Wolverines began 
closing the gap, it was an unlikely 

candidate who kept them at bay. 
After playing only three minutes 
in the first half, Chambers called 
on fifth-year guard Curtis Jones 
Jr. — who entered Wednesday 
night averaging 6.8 points on 
35.7-percent shooting — for 15 
second-half minutes.
As Jones prepared to check in, 
his coach delivered a message.
“These moments are made for 
seniors,” Chambers recalled telling 
him. “It’s your time.”
Jones 
answered 
the 
call, 
knocking down seven of his nine 
second-half shots in an 18-point 
explosion against subpar defense.
“If your hand is down versus 
a shooter — for example, Curtis 
Jones, who was just lining it up 
and shot it right in our face — that’s 
unacceptable,” Howard said. “You 
have to own it. You have to be able 
to do your job.”
Against 
Penn 
State, 
the 
Wolverines didn’t own it, nor did 
they do their job.
And for that, they dropped 
a game on their own floor in a 
conference where road wins are a 
rarity, putting them even further 
behind the eight ball.

Michigan loses to Penn State, 72-63, dropping its third-straight game behind a lackluster defensive effort

DANIEL DASH
Daily Sports Writer

This 
game 
against 
Penn 
State at home was supposed to 
be a way to get out of a slump, 
a way for the Michigan men’s 
basketball team to regain its 
rhythm — and some standing in 
the conference rankings. 
That is not what it turned out 
to be. 
What it turned out to be 
was 40 minutes of proof that 
Michigan’s issues on defense 
are still very much in play, 
at home or on the road, and 
that it boils down to a lack of 
communication.
“We 
just 
couldn’t 
get 
defensive stops,” sophomore 
forward Brandon Johns, Jr. 
said. “We just need to be better 
on defense. Our communication 
could’ve been a little bit better. 
We just need to be solid with all 
the little things on defense.”
Penn State shot 48.2 percent 
from the field, and 42.1 percent 
from the arc, in its eventual 
72-63 
win 
over 
Michigan. 
And it wasn’t as if all of those 

72 points were coming from 
distance. The Nittany Lions 
had 22 points in the paint. No 
matter where the shots were 
coming from, they were falling.
And the Wolverines had a 
hard time stopping them. 
“They got too many open 
looks,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Juwan 
Howard 
said. 
“And 
it was because of lack of 
communication 
on 
the 
defensive end. It’s January 22. 
We talked about it. We have to 
communicate on defense, be 
physical, don’t be surprised.” 
After Michigan was gashed 
in the post at Minnesota last 
week and continued to struggle 
inside against junior center 
Luka Garza and Iowa on Friday, 
going up against Penn State’s 
lethal combination of senior 
forwards, 
Lamar 
Stevens 
and Mike Watkins, was a tall 
task, 
literally. 
Stevens 
and 
Watkins give Penn State a lot 
of length. With Isaiah Livers 
still sidelined with a lingering 
groin injury, Michigan has 
been turning to a three-guard 
lineup at times, which left them 

looking somewhat small on the 
court Wednesday.
But the Wolverines’ problems 
were far from being contained 
inside the painted lines. Penn 
State punished Michigan from 
just about anywhere, taking 
advantage of the open looks 
they got from the Wolverines. 
The thing was, it wasn’t as if 
the Nittany Lions brought out 
radical new looks or started 
taking shots they haven’t been 
taking all season. Wednesday 
night’s shot chart looked pretty 
similar to any of a number of 
Penn State shot charts from 
this season.
Michigan knew what was 
coming. And they still couldn’t 
stop it. 
“We have a great scouting 
report, and we watch film on 
every opponent,” Howard said. 
“We see guys’ tendencies as 
well as their strengths, and 
who can shoot the ball and 
where they shoot the ball from.
“So there’s no surprises. I 
understand why guys get open 
looks. It tells me it’s because of 
lack of communication.”
As 
the 
Wolverines 
are 
seeming to sink further and 
further 
into 
their 
ongoing 
slump, the mood in the locker 
room is not helping. Players 
are “getting in their heads,” 
according 
to 
Johns. 
And 
that’s just making it harder on 
defense, where so much — as 
is becoming increasingly clear 
lately — depends on teammates 
talking to each other on the 
court.
If they don’t start talking, it 
doesn’t seem that the energy — 
or the defense — is going to get 
better anytime soon.
“It’s something you should 
do regardless,” junior guard 
Eli Brooks said. “You’re a 
basketball player. At the end of 
the day, hopefully you’ve been 
doing it your whole life. Talking 
on the court and just bringing 
energy are different things.”
