Foundation, corporation support
vital to researchers' efforts
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
and KYLE SWANSON
Daily Staff Reporters
Working in laboratories and offices across the Uni-
versity, professors and researchers typically have
more ideas than they know what to do with - wheth-
er it's exploring advanced batteries that could help
make widespread use of electric cars a reality, curing
life-threatening diseases in developing countries or
studying how psychological factors influence an indi-
vidual's decision to seek financial help.
While discoveries cannot be made without dedicat-
ed researchers who spend hours conducting experi-
ments and studies, researchers cannot do their work
without proper financial backing.
But with shrinking state appropriations and stu-
dents upset over tuition hikes, private support has
become increasingly important for funding research
at the University.
Though federal stimulus funds may help fill -the
funding gap right now, development officers at the
University work to establish long-term relationships
with foundations and corporations whose financial
support helps maintain fruitful and stable research at
the University.
"They're perhaps a little less interested in the cor-
nucopia of ideas that might exist at the University,"
Jefferson Porter, associate vice president for devel-
pment, said. "They're really looking for that one
thing that's going to help them solve the problem that
they're trying to solve."
FOUNDATIONAL SUPPORT
Foundations are nonprofit organizations that use
financial and sometimes other resources to advance
one or more charitable purposes. Unlike fundraising
from individuals, the University's Development Office
takes a very different approach to securing funding
from foundations.
Maureen Martin, senior director of foundation
relations, explained that foundations are often more
motivated to give based on project funding proposals
assembled by the foundation relations staff than on the
relationship building that other operations may use.
"Professional foundations tend to have a bunch ofstaff

Leading a library revolution
rqxI

How the evolution
of Paul Courant has
revamped the
concept of a library
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Eight floors up in the Harlan Hatch-
er Graduate Library, above the stacks,
rows of computers and groups of stu-
dents buried in books, you'll finda door
with a "Library Administration" sign
hanging above its frame.
If the maps of Constantinople, book-
shelves and rocking chair don't make
it clear, the sign on the desk that says
"hush" reveals that this office belongs
to a librarian. But the man behind this
particular door has revolutionized the
meaning ofthat job.
During the last four years, Dean of
Libraries Paul Courantchas played a key
role in the library revolution - helping
to convert disintegrating, musty texts
scattered in locations throughout the
world into a digitized form that will
forever be accessible in one centralhub
online.
A veteran of University adminis-
trations long past, Courant has held
some of the University's loftiest posi-

tions. From 2002 to 2005, he served as
provost and executive vice president
for academic affairs - meaning that
he wore the dueling hats of the chief
academic officer and the chief budget
officer.
When University Librarian Bill
Gosling retired in 2005, Courant was
asked to lead the search committee for
a new librarian to fill the position.
During the process though, Courant
said he became increasingly curious
with the role of libraries in collegiate
life and society more broadly. His col-
leagues on the committee took note,
and Provost Teresa Sullivan asked
Courant to step down as chair of the
search committee so he could be con-
sidered as a candidate.
He accepted and several months
later was tapped for the position.
Courant said the transition from
provost to dean of libraries was "sort
of like jumping off a train."
"I used to say as provost, when you
hear a dish breaking, it's your dish,"
he said, referencing the responsibil-
ity placed on whomever fills that job.
"And if you're librarian, it's only if a
book falls on somebody's toe, it's your
book."
He explained that the job is less
demanding - with his workweek
shortened from 80 to 60 hours and no
longer having 19 deans and multiple

It's a change that Courant's wife,

band's life.

with her husband than when he was

Recovering substance
abusers face frequent

By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
For many students, moving to Ann
Arbor to begin their careers at the
University of Michigan is a time of
excitement, curiosity and maybe a lit-
tle bit of fear. But for School of Social
Work graduate student Ivana Graho-
vac, the emotions were different.
As Grahovac prepared to start her
time at the University, she was also
recovering from a five-year addiction
to heroin. Though she had been clean
and sober for four-and-a-half years
in her hometown of Bloomfield Hills,
Mich., she wasn't sure she could ret-

reate that security in Ann Arbor.
Grahovac said coming to Ann
Arbor was a "leap of faith" and that
onceshe arrived, she felther sobriety
constantly threatened.
"I was constantly getting these
e-mails about being invited to join
people for keggers, drink night spe-
cials and pub-crawls," she said.
"There was just a real lack of under-
standing going on that maybe there
are people for whom this would be
a very bad choice and possibly cause
some serious negative and tragic
consequences to occur."
It was in this environment that Gra-
hovac decided to create Students for
Recovery, a group diming to support
and provide provides information for
students recovering from addiction.
The group also helps students find
sober programming as an alternative to

Breakthrough could
help stymie bone
weakening in patients
By ESHWAR
THIRUNAVUKKARASU
Daily StaffReporter
University researchers have taken
a major step toward what some con-
sider to be the next frontier in medical
advancements: regenerative medicine
- the repair and replacement of dis-
eased or otherwise troubled tissues
and organs.
This time, using embryonic stem
cells, scientists have come closer to
being able to create functional para-
thyroid cells as the basis for future
parathyroid gland transplants. .
Located in the neck, next to the
thyroid, are four pea-sized parathy-

roid glands, which are important to
the regulation of calcium levels with-
in bones. For some patients, these
glands may be inadvertently dam-
aged during the course of a thyroid
surgery, resulting in long-term bone
weakening or loss.
Dr. Gerard Doherty, chief of endo-
crine surgery and the lead researcher
for the project, said that he and his
team used stem cells to form differ-
entiated cells. These cells are capable
of producing an important chemical
messenger - parathyroid hormone or
PTH - that directs other cells called
osteoclasts to break down and remod-
el bones.
Decreased. PTH levels in the body
can lead to a condition where bones
soften, resulting in muscle weak-
ness and bone frailty, referred to as
osteomalacia.

Thieves' demand: bud or blood

Department of Public
Safety reports concerning
residence hall robberies
arecommonlyfoundinstu-
dent inboxes, but reports
about raids at knifepoint
are, not surprisingly, less
frequent.
That is, except for the
winter of 1974, when there
were two such robberies in
one night.
Between the hours of
midnight and 1 a.m. stu-
dents from both South
Quad Residence Hall and
West Quad Residence Hall
were threatened at knife-
pointby a group of robbers,
according to a January 26,
1974 article in The Michi-
gan Daily.
Howard Jacobson told

the Daily at the time that
three males sauntered into
his room in West Quad
through the half-open
door around 12:15 a.m. and
pulled out a knife, threat-
ening Jacobson and his
two friends.
The tallest of the three
assailants, wielding a
12-inch butcher knife, tar-
geted one of Jacobson's
friends and said, "You
have three minutes to find
some dope or I'll slit your
throat," according to the
article in the Daily.
Three minutes didn't
give the friend much time
and when the victims could
not produce any "dope,"
the tallest robber repeated
the threat and searched

the room himself.
Upon finding Jacobson's
wallet containing $50,
the shortest of the rob-
bers nervously urged his
cohorts to quit the scene,
according to the article.
After instructingthe three
victims to count to 50, they
fled the scene, taking the
$50 with them.
A mere 30 minutes later,
Mark Katzenberger, Tim
Ryback and Debra Joy
heard a knock on their
door in South Quad. Upon
opening the door, they saw
two of the three robbers
who had visited Jacobson's
room.
The assailants brought
the 12-inch knife with
them once again and the

tallest drew the knife to
Katzenberger's throat and
promised to slit it if mari-
juana was not produced,
according to the Daily
article.
These three victims
were also forced to the
ground while the robbers
searched the room for the
illusive "dope." The rob-
bers came up short, but did
snag $15 from Katzenberg-
er's wallet, and $5 from
Joy's.
This time the victims
were instructed to count
to 300 while the assail-
ants made their getaway.
The victims, IRyback told
the Dairy, rebelliously only
counted to 100.

DETROIT
Granholm wants
Robert Bobb for a
second year
Michigan Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm says she wants the emergen-
cy financial manager of Detroit's
schools to stay on for a second year
to continue efforts to improve the
struggling district.
Granholm told reporters yester-
day after a Midwestern Governors
Association event that Robert Bobb
is "doing a very tough but very im-
portant job" for the district, which
faces a $259 million budget deficit.
Bobb said this week he wouldn't
commit to staying on beyond his
contract but has been in talks with
Granholm's office.
Granholm appointed Bobb to a
one-year term that began in March
to straighten out the finances of the
Detroit Public Schools. He has over-
seen a massive restructuring that
has closed 29 schools and overhauled
scores of others.

Montana legislator
faces 3 felonies
in boat crash
Prosecutors yesterday filed felony
charges against a Montana state
senator accused of recklessly endan-
gering a U.S. congressman and three
others when he allegedly crashed
a boat at high speed onto a rocky
embankment after a night of drink-
ing.
Barkus denied drinking as much
as prosecutors allege and said he was
not impaired.
State Sen. Greg Barkus was drink-
ing scotch and wine before the Aug.
27 crash, and had a blood-alcohol
level of .16 - twice the legal limit -
when he was tested nearly two hours
later at a hospital, prosecutors said in
charging documents.
U.S. Rep. Denny Rehberg suffered
a broken ankle and other injuries in
the Flathead Lake crash, while Reh-
berg's state director, Dustin Frost,
spent 10 days in a coma and has a
severe brain injury. Barkus broke his

also hurt.

Pot legalization
gains momentum
in California
Marijuana advocates are gather-
ingsignaturestogetasmanyasthree
pot-legalization measures on the
ballot in 2010 in California, setting
up what could be a groundbreaking
clash with the federal government
over U.S. drug policy.
At least one poll shows voters
would support lifting the pot prohi-
bition, which would make the state
of more than 38 million the first in
the nation to legalize marijuana.
Such action would also send the
state into a headlong conflict with
the U.S. government while raising
questions about how federal law
enforcement could enforce its drug

laws in the face of a massive govern-
ment-sanctioned pot industry.
The state already has a thriving
marijuana trade, thanks to a first-
of-its-kind 1996 ballot measure that
allowed people to smoke pot for
medical purposes. But full legaliza-
tion could turn medical marijuana
dispensaries into all-purpose pot
stores, and the open sale of joints
could become commonplace on
mom-and-pop liquor store counters
in liberal locales like Oakland and
Santa Cruz.

who are domain experts, who can
help the foundation make decisions
about whether something really does
move this social change forward or
not," Martin said. "In professional
foundations, then, the University is
alwaysmakingtonsofproposals."
However, proposals must be cre-
ated with demonstrated benefits for
both the University and the foun-
dation from whom money is being
sought. Fortunately, because foun-
dations publicly disclose the amount
of money they've given for different
projects, Martin said she is easily
able to track down information.
"Foundation information is all
public information, so my job is
much easier than someone who
fundraises in individual giving or
in corporate giving," Martin said.
"I can know every grant they gave
away last year ... I can know how
their portfolio is doing."
Foundations also typically like to
fund programs that will be sustain-
able or will have lasting implications
on whateverissue is being addressed.
This can be one of the more chal-
lenging parts for development offi-
cerstodemonstrate, since oftentimes
researchproposals cannotguarantee
beneficial results or findings.
"In community-based public
health, you can't say you're going to
solve those problems in three years,
but what you can say is that you are
not only working with the commu-
nity organization to build the capac-
ity to solve the problem, but you're
also training the next generation
of leaders who will be community
organizers, community activists,
public health workers," Martin said.
To increase the University's
chances of receiving money from
foundations, Martin said she often
works with faculty members to

determine which foundations
would be most likely to fundaspecific
research projects.
During the 2009 fiscal year, the
Foundation Relations division of
the Office of Development raised
approximately $45.4 million from
foundations. On average, gifts were
just over $100,000 and each foun-
dation that gave to the University
averaged about $267,000 in total
donations during the year.
Many foundations issue requests
for proposals in which they seek
applications to fund programs
meeting specific criteria, but Mar-
tin said most of the foundations
that she works with handle funding
requests on a rolling cycle - mean-
ing the University can simply sub-
mit a proposal for a project at any
time during the year.
Martin said that although many
foundations give to the University
on a somewhat regular basis, other
foundations give sporadically.
"At a significant level -.donors
who give a total of maybe more than
$1million ayear -it'sgenerally going
to be the same 20 foundations each
year," she said. "At the $50,000 to
$150,000 gift, there's lots of moving
in and out - so those change all the
time."
Martin said that the majority
of foundation funding comes from
outside of Michigan.
"There are some key foundations
inside the state that we go to regular-
ly," she said. "(But) most of the fund-
ing is coming from outside the state"
Though the majority of foundation
support comes from outside the state,
Porter said 'gifts from foundations
transcend stateborders because they
fund the research of problems felt
across the country and the world.
"With foundations, often these
are charitable organizations that
have been established to solve one
or more societal problems so there's
a certain altruism at work in what

they're trying to do," Porter said.
CORPORATE CONNECTIONS
Two years ago, the University's
Business Engagement Center was
established in an effort to strength-
en existing relationships between
corporations and the University
and search for new potential busi-
ness partners.
Before the BEC existed, the Uni-
versity's Office of Development
handled corporate relations. But
because of the growing number of
companies interested in Univer-
sity partnerships as public research
becomes a cheap alternative to pri-
vate research in tough economic
times, the University decided to cre-
ate the BEC - a separate entity that
focuses specifically on corporations.
Today, the BEC partners with the
Office of Development and Office of
the Vice President for Research to
expand the various ways in which
the University works with corpo-
rations to increase funding to the
University.
DarylWeinert, executive director
of the Business Engagement Cen-
ter, said one objective of the BEC is
to build lasting relationships with
small and large companies alike, so
that both the University and busi-
nesses can benefit from partner-
ships over time.
"The University isn't really set up
to be a transactional entity," Wein-
ert said. "It usually works better for
both sides if we develop a longer-
term relationship."
While a major goal of the center
is to foster philanthropic relation-
ships, Weinert said the BEC also
works with companies to promote
research grants, student recruit-
ment, licensing opportunities and
the sponsorship of student projects.
"We're really ahead of the curve
nationally on this," Weinert said.
"We've fundamentally restructured

the way we interact with companies."
Within the BEC, relationship
managers are assigned to specific
companies to act as liaisons between
the company and University. The
relationship managers are respon-
sible for communicating with the
company on a regular basis to dis
cuss potential partnership opportu-
nities.
Besides talking with individual
companies, relationship managers
are assigned to schools and colleges
at the University's three campus-.
es. The managers work with each
school to gather information on
what mightspark corporate invest-
ment and what kind of corporate
involvement the school would like
to experience.
Weinert said that while the BEC
is more involved with the School of
Engineering and Medical School,
it has helped every unit on campus
form some kind of connection with
a business.
Among other things, the BEC
helps units and faculty at the Uni-
versity write proposals for research
grants, scholarships and fellowships
to obtain funding from companies
the University has partnered with
in the past.
Though the support companies
provide to the University is of tre-
mendous value, Porter said com-
panies also often benefit from their
gifts to the University.
"Companies are generally sup-
portive of higher education institu-
tions, particularly top-tier research
institutions like Michigan because
they see enormous value in support-
ing the best possible students who
ultimately might become recruits
for their company," Porter said.
Weinert said the BEC does this
because it knows the types of proj-
ects companies have historically
funded and what they may be inter-
ested in funding in the future. He
added that the center gives realistic

advice to groups that are drafting
proposals.
Weinert cited one such scenario
with General Motors Co., which has
a strong research relationship with
the University, but is not currently
capable of dishing outhuge grants.
"General Motors isn't at a point
right now to make philanthropic
grants so (we'tell faculty) 'I don't
think your time willbe well spent,"'
Weinert said. "Or we know histori-
cally General Motors won't fund
programs in this area so we recom-
mend 'You shouldn't take the tine'
or'Hell,absolutely; thatfitsrighton.
We've seen that has been a priority
for them inthe past."'
While researchers often seek
grants from companies, Weinert
said the relationship is sometimes
reversed, with corporations search-
ing for specific researchers.
"We are often in the mix, helping
a company make connections to indi-
vidualresearchersinareas where they
have atechnical interest," he said.
While the BEC has only been
around for two years, the Univer-
sity has seen a big dollar boost from
the center. In the 2008 fiscal year,
corporate revenue - including
donations, research contracts and
transfer licensing revenue - totaled,
about $140 million.
Though numbers for the 2009
fiscal year were not yet ready when
Weinert was interviewed last month,
he said the center had managed inqui-
ries from more than 300 new entities
over the last year that had no prior
relationship with the University.
Based on the large interest, Wein-
ert said he thinks the BEC is suc-
cessfullydrawingin corporations to
invest in the University.
"It proves our hypothesis that
having a unit at the University that
can handle very broadly the rela-
tionships with industry and under-
stand what the University has to
offer is valuable to folks," he said.


STEM CELLS

change the way treatment is done,
we have come up with a way to take
undifferentiated embryonic stem
cells and make them develop into
parathyroid-like cells," Doherty said.
Doherty said the results of the
study hold promise for the foresee-
ablefuture-notjustforparathyroid
replacement but for regenerative
medicine as a whole.
Using biological parts over pros-
thetic ones in medical practice, he
said, has the advantage of minimiz-
ing patient rejection of transplants.
"If we can get to the long-term
goal of making replacement parts
for people, then regenerative medi-
cine will be the next frontier in
medical practice," Doherty said.
The development comes within

a year of two major legal mile-
stones for researchers working
with stem cells.
In November 2008, Michigan
voters passed a constitutional
amendment allowing researchers to
develop their own stem cell lines.
Then, last March, President
Barack Obama reversed an execu-
tive order signed by President
George W. Bush in 2001 that lim-
ited federal funding for stem cell
research.
Doherty's team relied on one of the
60embryonicstemcelllinesapproved
by the Bush administration.
The next step in the project, he
said, wouldbe to circumvent the use
of embryonic stem cells altogether
and use each patient's own cells.'
Doherty, a Norman W. Thomp-
son Professor of endocrine surgery
at the University's Medical School,
said that differentiated cells within

the thymus - an organ critical to
the immune system - are an attrac-
tive option to cultivate parathyroid
cells for transplants.
"We like to start with cells which
are as close to the end point as we
can, so we can do as few steps in
the Petri dish as possible," he said.
"Some cells within the thymus
express markers similar to parathy-
roid cells."
Clinical application of this labo-
ratory success may not be too far
away, Doherty said.
Transplantation of parathyroid
cells from their normal position
in the neck to other places in the
body has been successful in the
past. The function of the parathy-
roid glands, he said, is preserved
within each of its cells, reducing
the number of challenges of com-
plete organ replacement.
"I would anticipate that, over
think is important."
The ultimate goal of the group
is to reduce the stigma associated
with addiction, Grahovac said.
"When people get clean and
sober it doesn't mean that they
want to stop having fun or that they
want to stop socializing," she said.
"They wantto do all thesethings in
a way that edifies their mind, body
and spirit."

the next couple of years, we could mals,"said Doherty."For people, it's
potentially make this work in ani- five to 10 years away."

ADDICTION .
From Page 1A
the usual Friday night party filled
with red Solo cups and alcohol.
Mary Jo Desprez, alcohol and
other drugs policy administrator
at the University Health Service on
campus, said the group is part of a
larger trend of campuses provid-
ing support groups for students
recovering from addiction.
There are similar programs
across the country at colleges
like the University of Minne-
sota, Texas Tech University and
the State University of New York
at Stony Brook.
Lara Hunter, coordinator
of Clinical Alcohol and Other
Drugs Services at Stony Brook,
said in an e-mail interview that
she started Stony Brook's recov-
ery group last year.
"It is vital to the well-being of
the student in recovery to have
other students that he or she-can
relateto and gain support from,"
she wrote. "People in recovery
need to alter or control their
environments as much as pos-
sible as to not be in the face of
alcohol or drugs and on a college
campus. That is a challenge."
To get the University of
Michigan group off the ground,
Grahovac reached out to School
of Social Work Prof. Brian Per-
ron, as well as University Health
Service officials.
"I met with them," she said.
"And together they both gave
me the thumbs up and said
dream big."
From there, Grahovac sent
out ane-mail to all the students,
faculty and staff in the School
of Social Work inquiring about
prospective interest in creat-
ing such a group. She said she
received overwhelming support
not only from people in recov-
ery, but also from people who
wanted to support.
Perron said he decided to
work with the group because it
fills a void on campus.
"There are many activities
for people who are interested in
going to parties," he said. "But
for someone with a substance
abuse problem, this isn't a help-
ful environment for them and
the group recognizes this."

He added that since this group is
student-driven, it has the potential
to be very attractive to students and
continue to grow over the years.
Desperez said she's excited to see
a group like this at the University.
"We are filling a need for stu-
dents in recovery to make sure they
feel support from the University,"
she said. "Especially if they make
the transition to campus, which we

Redefining marriage
Michigan should follow trend of support for same-sex unions
A nother state has begun to question its discriminatory ban
on same-sex marriage this week - unfortunately, it's not
Michigan. On Oct. 1, a Texas district judge ruled that
Texas's ban on same-sex marriage violates the U.S. Constitution,
the first ruling of its kind in the state. This ruling is part of a
growing trend among judicial bodies to rule in favor of same-sex
marriage and in favor of a basic human right. Moving forward,
state legislatures should be more active in the process of revers-
ing the blatantly discriminatory bans, and Michigan's must be
among them.

First come, first seated

On October 1, Texas District Judge Tena
Callahan ruled that two men married in
Massachusetts could legally dissolve their
marriage in Texas because the Constitution
dictates "full faith and credit shall be given
in each state to the public acts, records and
judicial proceedings of every other state."
In other words, a marriage conducted in
one state should be recognized in all others.
Judge Callahan further held that the state's
ban on gay marriage violates the Constitu-
tion. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott
is attempting to have the case overturned
by higher courts in order to defend the "tra-
ditional definition of marriage" that was
approved by 75 percent of the voters when
the constitutional ban was enacted.
Such a definition of marriage is mor-
ally backward and actively discriminatory
toward gay people. Gay relationships are
just as loving and valid as heterosexual
relationships, and for any law to pretend
otherwise amounts to a tragic failing of
justice. The fact that this injustice has'
been pushed onto most of the country by
a hateful, socially conservative minority is
fundamentally wrong and requires imme-
diate corrective action in state and nation-
al courts and legislative bodies.
Thankfully, Texas is not the first state
to revisit these bans, and instead comes
at a time when gay rights are beginning to

gain a measure of support from favorable
court rulings and occasional legislative
decisions. Massachusetts, Iowa, Con-
necticut, Vermont, New Hampshire and
Maine have all legalized same-sex mar-
riage. The District of Columbia City Coun-
cil also recently introduced legislation to
allow same-sex marriage. With any hope,
this emerging climate of tolerance her-
alds a shift from the culture that gave us
the despicable Defense of Marriage Act of
1996, which defined marriage as between
one man and one woman.
But while countless states are reconsid-
ering their discriminatory laws toward
LGBT people, gay marriage remains ille-
gal in Michigan thanks to a constitutional
amendment in 2009. The longer Michigan
waits to join the changing tide in favor of
gay marriage, the longer it must stand, dis-
graced, in the shadow of its ignorance on
this issue. And with any hope, when the
change does come, it will be the result of
deliberate action on the part of 'alegisla-
ture unafraid to tell the voters of Michigan
that it supports same-sex marriage and the
equality of all people beforethe, law.-,
The immoral crusade to ban same-sex
marriage has turned gay couples into sec-
ond-class citizens. Michigan must join the
trend and end its discriminatory marriage
laws withqut equivocation.

y trip toEast Lansing this
weekend gave me a lot to
dislike about the green
and white. Their
campus is point- '4
lessly vast and des-
olate. They have a.
strange obsession '
with Busch Light,
and that drainage'
ditch they call the
Red Cedar kind of
smells.
But there is one CHRIS
thing right about KOSLOWSKI
Spartan football
Saturdays. Though
Michigan's stu-
dent section triumphs over Michigan
State's in style, tradition and nowvol-
ume, the Spartans' way of seating stu-
dents is superior to ours. At Michigan
Stadium, this method could eliminate
many headaches for fans and end the
current haphazard seating delegation
system. Even though I'm having a
hard time convincing myself that giv-
ing up my personal piece of the Big
House would be a good idea, I still
think Michigan should make its stu-
dent section first come, first dibs.
While I waited for my season
tickets to arrive this summer, I
was ecstatic. Finally, as a senior, I
wouldn't need supplemental oxygen
to stave off hypoxia as I watched
maize and blue ants scurry about
from my lofty perch above row 80.
With "low" hopes, I tore open my
envelope and promptly lost much of
my faith in humanity. Section 30, row
40, just halfway down the bowl.
I don't know why I'm not sitting
pretty in row 15 like I had always
dreamed. Did I apply too late? Were
too many people in my seating group?
Too few? Had all those people in rows
1-39 amassed more credits than I did,

or was I just unlucky? I'm sure many
students are thrilled with their seem:
ingly arbitrarily determined seats,
but as an obvious loser in that draw-
ing, frankly, I'm peeved.
In most stadiums, including the
remainder of Michigan Stadium, the
more you're willing to pay, the bet-
ter seats you have. Staggering the
seating price in the student section
might raise the chance of obtaining
desirable seats for those who have
the cash, but the price difference
between the upper and lower rows
would have to be massive to make a
reasonable impact on which section
students would choose. Also, raising
some student section tickets above
$25 would prevent many students on
a limited budget from attending the
games.
The simplest solution is also the
fairest - make the student section
first come, first served. Michigan
could open a designated waiting sec-
tion on Friday before game day and
award the diehards who arrive early
their choice of seats. As less crazed
students file in hours before kickoff,
they simply sit in the best open seat
they see. Michigan State does it, and
it works.
The benefits are plestiful. If I real-
ly wanted to sit in the front row dur-
ing the Ohio State game, I could, but
I better plan on bringing my camping
gear. The desire to snag good seats
would give me another motivation to
wake up earlier and, naturally, party
earlier. Any excuse for that is good
by me. Best of all, the student section
would be forever purged of latecom-
ers whining about their occupied
seats.
I can't stress enough what a joy this
would be. It's incredible how so many
people are astonished when they
stumble into the stadium at the end of

the first quarter and find their seats
taken. Nothing disrupts the game
more than the inevitable arguments,
and often belligerency, that follows.
With thousands of students cram-
ming into bleachers with no seat
backs, it's too easy for someone to
migrate away from their assigned
seat. All it takes is one wanderer and
one jackass to start a chain reaction
with the potential to ruin the game
experience of many. First come, first
served would end that. People may
worry about the potential of over-

seating has a one-up
on the Big House.
crowding in the more popular rows.
Well, come talk to me during the Penn
State game and I'll show you that it's
already a problem ... in row 40!
I'm not naive. I know that if I had
a better seat this year, I probably
wouldn't be complaining. I'd also be
a fool if I didn't admit that I enjoy
taking my seat - usually without
problems - just moments before Blue
runs under the MClub banner. But
the more I think about it, the more
first come, first served seating makes
sense to me. The Athletic Department
should seriously consider the shift,
even if only as an experiment.
In the meantime, if everyone in
rows 38-42 could arrive at the next
game before kickoff, that would be
super.

Seeking solutions in Palestine

Since his address to the Muslim world from
Cairo, Egypt, President Barack Obama has
called on Israel to halt settlement construction
in the West Bank, rightfully identifying the
expansion of Israel's illegal settlements as one
of the primary roadblocks to peace. But under
the leadership of right-wing politician Benjamin
Netanyahu, Israelhas rebuffed Obama'srequest,
claiming a "fundamental right" to expand exist-
ing settlements and, in some instances, grant
new building permits to Jewish settlers.
For years, Israel has blamed Arab intransi-
gence for the failure of past peace initiatives and
processes. To this day, Israel has yet to compel
itself to come to terms with what its existence
has meant for the Palestinian people. Since 1947,
Arab Palestinians - Christians and Muslims -
have been the victims of forced dispossession,
dislocation, a brutal military occupation and an
overall denial of their basic right to exercise self-
determination. The majority of Palestinians are
now a scattered people, living mostly in squalid
refugee camps throughout the West Bank, Gaza
Strip, Syria; Lebanon and Jordan; under an
unforgiving Israeli military occupation in the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank; or as second-
class citizens of Israel. Yet, there is hope.
Following Israel's bombardment of the Gaza
Strip last winter, 1,400 Palestinians were killed
in under 23 days,with the majority civilians
and a significant proportion of children. Orga-
nizations and people of conscience have stood
up in defense of the human rights of Palestin-
ians. The United Nations recently conducted
a massive fact-finding mission titled "Human
Rights in Palestine and Other Occupied Arab
Territories:Report of the United Nations Fact
Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict." This
575-page report outlines, in meticulous detail,
Israel's numerous human rights abuses against
the Palestinians, including, but not limited to,
Israel's ongoing illegal blockade and siege of the
Gaza Strip; attacks on government buildings
and police forces last winter; indiscriminate
attacks by Israeli armed forces last winter that
resulted in the intense loss of life and injury to
civilians; Israel's use of phosphorous munitions
in contravention of internationally recognized
rules of war; and, most disturbingly, Israel's use
of Palestinian civilians as human shields when
conducting raids. The report also criticized the
behavior of Hamas guerillas, specifically when
it came to the reckless launching of homemade

rockets into southern Israel. Interestingly
enough, neither the United Nations nor Amnes-
ty International were able to find any evidence
that Hamas guerillas, or any other Palestinian
militants, used Palestinian civilians as human
shields during last winter's conflict. This was
something Israel repeatedly claimed last win-
ter as Palestinian civilians were dying by the
dozens at the hands of the Israeli "Defense"
Forces.
Although the United States and Israel have
tried to discredit the findings of the United
Nations report, such claims are unfounded and
are not based on any sort of legitimate criti-
cismi of the report's actual substance. Accord-
ing to Israel and the United States, the report
is biased against Israel because it details Israeli
war crimes and calls for Israel to hold its lead-
ers accountable. We encourage you to read the
report for yourself.
Additionally on Capitol Hill, two new lobby
groups, J Street and the American Association
for Palestinian Equal Rights, have formed with
the explicit intention of changing Washington's
role in the Middle East. Both organizations have
recognized that the time has come for the Unit-
ed States to function as a truly impartial media-
tor between Israel and the Palestinians instead
of as a dishonest broker that supports Israel
unconditionally.
As students at an institution of higher edu-
cation, it is no longer appropriate for us to stay
silent as Israel continues to prioritize its own
security needs over fundamental Palestin-
ian rights. Israel is no more secure today than
it was 61 years ago when its creation resulted
in the displacement of 750,000 Arab Palestin-
ians. Israel actually undermines its own secu-
rity when it arbitrarily imposes curfews in the
West Bank and denies the Gaza Strip of much-
needed medical supplies. The question now is
what we can do to help contribute to a just and
sustainable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict - one that protects the basic human
rights of both Israelis and Palestinians.
Tomorrow, Students Allied for Freedom
and Equality begins a two-day conference to
address these issues. The conference is sched-
uled to begin at 4:30 p.m. in 150 Hutchins Hall,
and is free for students.
Mike Sayre is the media chair of Students
Allied for Freedom and Equality.

n a recent pleasant fall day, I
walked to class through the
Diag only to be disrupted by
raucous, odious
sermons emanating
from an insane so-
called messenger of
Christ. My experi-
ence isn't an isolat-
ed one. The Diag is
regularly abused by
religious extrem-
ists in order to pro-H
mote their beliefs HARSHA
in an uncouth and PANDURANGA
hateful manner.
These religious
extremists should be banned from
preaching on campus because they
are in clear violation of the official
discrimination policies put in place
by the University to ensure that stu-
dents live in a welcoming and hospi-
table environment.
Undoubtedly, religious freedom
is vital to an accepting environment
on any college campus. But there is a
discernible difference between hate-
spewing preachers on the Diag and
student organizations such as the
Campus Crusade for Christ and Mus-
lim Student Association, which pro-
mote an inclusive environment while
proliferating their message. They
have respect and tolerance for others'
beliefs. The University is an excellent
place to become accustomed to the
unfamiliar, and religion is no excep-
tion - but many Diag preachers don't
contribute anything even remotely
conducive to a healthy exchange of
information on campus.
Certain hate-filled Diag preach-

ers are irritating and offensive - but
this isn't enough to propose ban-
ning them from University property.
Free speech is protected to a certain
extent on campus, as it should be.
Excerpts from the University State-
ment on Freedom of Speech and
Artistic Expression state: "Expres-
sion of diverse points of view is of the
highest importance... the belief that
an opinion is pernicious, false, or in
any other way detestable cannot be
grounds for its suppression."
This portion of the University's
policy seems to be tolerant of the
preachers' diatribes. But these evan-
gelists take their messages a step
too far and violate the discrimina-
tion and harassment codes. They
are an example of lax enforcement
of the codes, since their words are
clear examples of "bias incidents" on
campus. Bias incidents are defined as
"non-criminal activities that harm
another because of that person's race,
color, national origin or ancestry,
sex, gender identity or expression,
sexual orientation, disability, age,
religion, height, weight, marital sta-
tus and veteran status." Protections
against bias and discrimination exist
for a good reason - campus without
those rules may become an uninvit-
ing atmosphere for both current and
potential students.
The Diag evangelists regularly
hurl verbal abuses that are clearly
defined as "bias incidents" at passers-
by. For example, one can often hear
plentiful examples of clear anti-ho-
mosexual rhetoric as well as religious
intolerance like, "homosexuality is a
sin, you're going to Hell," or, "accept

Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior
or be subject to eternal damnation!"
These types of incidents, which at
least qualify as "insulting comments"
based on sexual orientation and reli-
gion - apart from being simply base-
less and offensive - are what should
qualify as bias rather than the jok-
ing profanity often scrawled on dry-
erase boards in the residence halls.
This enforcement of the bias rules is
inconsistent and asinine.
Why preaching on
the Diag should
be put to rest.
Banning the preachers would be
aligned with the University's inter-
ests of protecting its students from
sources of discomfort on campus -
especially since the Diag is a loca-
tion universally frequented by the
student population. Hateful religious
sermonizers can preach away on city
property, but they have no place at
the University. Any action taken to
prevent them from speaking could
only strengthen religious dialogue on
campus. Let's put into effect the rules
that were designed to protect us on
campus, President Coleman: no more
hateful soapbox drama on the Diag. I
know I'm not the only one offended.

Hawkeyes have not allowed a rush-

his limited play this season in both

Tatsuno nets two victories in individual play

By ALEX HERMANN
For the Daily
Fall play for the Michigan
women's tennis team gives indi-
vidual athletes an opportunity to
improve their worth before the
season begins in January.
The Wolverines, in their bid for
high individual rankings, sent four
participants to the Intercollegiate
Tennis Association All-American
Qualifying this week. The tour-
nament features some of the best
competition from across the coun-
try.
Rika Tatsuno, with a pair of

wins on the opening day of play,
did the most to help her cause.
After defeating her first oppo-
nent, William & Mary senior
Ragini Acharya, in three sets (6-4,
2-6, 6-4), Tatsuno faced another
tough challenger in Texas Chris-
tian senior Megan Alexander.
The No. 111 player in the country
put up a tough battle, but Tatsuno
advanced in a very tight three-set
match (2-6, 6-4, 7-6).
"In the second set, Rita changed
.it up and started stepping up on
the court," Michigan coach Ronni
Bernstein said. "She fought it out
today and did a good job of fighting

the whole time and playing really
well."
Going into yesterday, Tatsuno
needed to beat Southern Cal fresh-
man Danielle Lao to advance past
the qualifying rounds. Lao started
out hot in the pre-qualifying tour-
nament by rattling off three wins,
all in straight sets, and then made
quick work of her two opponents
in straight sets again on Tuesday.
In the showdown between Tat-
suno and Lao, Tatsuno jumped out
to an early lead, taking the first set.
But she couldn't hold on as her foe
took the next two (4-6, 6-2, 6-4).
The Wolverines' doubles teams

didn't see the same success as Tat-
suno did in singles play. Tatsuno
and junior partner Whitney Taney
lost to the top-seeded duo from
Mississippi, while senior Tania
Mahtani and freshman Mimi
Nguyen fell in a very close match,
9-7.
But both pairs bounced back
yesterday, each winning two con-
solation matches.
Four other players and assistant
coach Teryn Ashley-Fitch will
head to the Kentucky Invitational
Tournament this weekend to bat-
tle against players from 12 differ-
ent universities.

We're about to find out
what it's like to Tweet from
Iowa City. Our guess: just
like Tweeting from A2 -

COURANT
From Page 1A
the overstuffed, red-velvet arm-
chairs that furnish their living
room. "He does travel a lot, but
I will say that I think he's more
relaxed."
She added that the anxiety and
tension that marked her, husband's
time as provost - for example, get-
ting up at 4 a.m. on some sleepless
nights to go and check his e-mail -
has now dissipated. He seems less
stressed, she said.
"My impression is that having
him working on library issues, he's
having fun," Manildi said.
Paul Courant's idea of fun differs
from most.
A KNOWLEDGE REVOLUTION
The age-old notion of a library
has fallen by the wayside as an
Internet-driven technology trans-
formation has turned the collegiate
libraries of today into information
warehouses - stocking and pre-
serving the world's collection of
books, audio, video, images and data
into a one-stop shop for knowledge.
Recognizing this shift, Courant
has dived in head first to lead the
University's progression - the off-
shoots of which have revamped the
state of information for society.
Sullivan wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that with Courant at the helm,
the University's library has been at
the vanguard of dynamic techno-
logical times.
"Academic libraries around the
worldfaceahostofnewopportunities
as scholarly communication moves
into the digital age," Sullivan wrote.
"Professor Courant has been
engaged with these issues for many
years," she continued. "As an econ-
omist with considerable budgetary
experience, he brings important
expertise to our libraries as they
are transformed to meet the needs
of the 21st century."
While the job typically involves
daily meetings and conference calls,
during the last few years, Courant's
career has revolved around the
Google Books Library Project -
a joint venture between the tech
juggernaut and a catalogue of the
world's most advanced libraries.
Through the project, the University
Library has become the first in the
world to have the majority of its col-
lection digitized.
Even before he became dean of
libraries, Courant took the first step

in negotiating the original version
of the arrangement with Google in
2004, a move that got him "very
excited."
"This was going to transform the
way in which we did research and
teaching and transform the way in
whichlibraries would work and pro-
vide opportunities to our students
and faculty of a kind that actually
never existed before," he said.
By 2011, more than 7 million of
the University's books will be avail-
able online at no cost to students,
faculty and staff. Outside universi-
ties will have to pay a fee to access
the digitized collection.
The University will not make any
money from the deal, but Courant
said it's getting "something of great
value."
He explained that free access
to the works allows the library to
reprint books that are deteriorat-
ing whether it is because they are
printed on acid paper or a plethora
of other reasons.
"You know how if you look at an
old paperback, you open it up and it
all turns into cornflakes?" he asked.
"That was high acid paper."
With the Google Book Project,
the University won't have to worry
about losing books to normal wear
and tear.
The repercussions of the project
for the long-standing notion of a
wood-lined, whispers-only library
are many.
Despite the advantages of having
tangible books on hand, Courant
said the University Library's books
will be uselessly sitting on shelves
while students browse them on
their laptops.
"This is blasphemous," he said.
"But it's true. We don't need to have
3 million books in the middle of
campus."
Courant said he predicts the Uni-
versity Library will use converted
files to make materials even more
digitally accessible in the future.
"In a few years, most of what I
expect will be in the library (will
be) in a form where you'll be able
to load it into something that looks
like a Kindle or a Sony Reader and
read it very easily," he said.
He added that the stacks will
eventually disappear.
With this shift, Courant said the
role of universities and libraries will
become increasingly important as
society moves into the "information
age," where loads of information
are available at people's fingertips.
"The problem of converting
information into knowledge and

knowledge into wisdom is every
bit as important as it always was,"
he said. "The University is the place
that's going to figure out how to do
that, and within it, the library is
going to be the place in the Univer-
sity that figures that out."
RE-THINKING NEW
TECHNOLOGIES
Halfway through a renewable
five-year term as dean of libraries,
Courant said that in addition to the
Google Books Project, he hopes to
focus on other interests as well.
Between negotiations with
Google and back-to-back faculty
meetings, Courant said he admits
he finds social networking tools like
Facebook extremely interesting.
Though Courant uses Facebook to
keep track of a cluster of relatives,
his fascination with the sit is more
than one-dimensional.
Courant has spent some time
seriously considering the possibil-
ity of a Facebook archive that could
be used for research purposes in
the future.
"On Facebook we could have this
extraordinary archive of how peo-
ple communicated," he said. "We
want sociologists 50 years from
now to understand how people
were spending their time commu-
nicating with each other."
Copyright issues and questions
about legal ownership make it dif-
ficult to create this kind of preser-
vation today. But the possibility of a
Facebook record is not completely
out of the picture.
Courant is a member of a panel
working for the National Science
Foundation to preserve web content.
In addition to the U.S. govern-
ment, national and international
libraries have expressed strong
interest in supporting the project
and finding a way to prevent the
information published on websites,
including Facebook, YouTube and
Twitter, from being forever lost in
the abyss of cyberspace.
Courant is no stranger to the
ever-changing world of Internet
publishing. Aside from the number
of academic communities to which
he claims membership, Courant is a
part of a more expansive, less exclu-
sive society: the blogosphere.
His blog - called "Au Courant"
- discusses everything from his
endeavors as dean of libraries to
field trips with his wife to Yankee
Stadium, though Courant admits he
finds little time for blogging.
"I haven't blogged much of any-

thing in the last six months, which
is bad practice," he said. "Good
bloggers blog regularly.",
Despite Courant's sporadic
posting tendencies, the blog has
developed a following from pub-
lishers who are eager to learn
about new developments in the
Google Books Project and other
anonymous readers.
BEHIND THE LIBRARIAN
Despite all that is on his plate,
libraries and Internet databases are
not all that occupy Courant's life. If
the classic portrait of alibrarian sug-
gests someone slightly mousy, with
glasses and his dhet nose deep in a
book, Courant shatters that image.

While he does wear glasses, his
outgoing disposition and the stud
in his left ear leave little evidence of
his profession.
Courant rides his BMW R115OR
motorcycle around campus - if not
to work. In his free time, he takes
yoga classes with his wife.
Ann Arbor residents of 36 years,
the empty nesters - with three sons
in their 20s and 30s - are never
short of a desire for somethingnew.
The two often come to the rescue of
kayakers who tip over or get stuck in
the Huron River, which runs along
the west side of their backyard.
Courant said the current was
"awfully fast" this summer, leading
to quite a few rescue efforts.
Besides rescuing kayakers, Cou-

rant enjoys watching the Detroit
Tigers, skiing, fishing and play-
ing with his dogs Bear and Moose,
despite their small stature.
More than anything, Courant
loves to teach. He currently teaches
a 200-level public policy class.
"I don't have to teach in this job,"
he said. "I do it because I like it."
While he enjoys seeing academic
progress when he teaches, Courant
said the best part is watching stu-
dents discover themselves.
"I very much enjoy watching
students go from being just out of
high school into life," he said, with
a smile.

§ilfOt CloSC Our eY while listening to the
q Unive sity of Michigan Men's Glee Club, you might feel
like you're lost in 18th-century London or strolling down
Diagon Alley in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. How,
.though, can an organization with an old-fashioned, almost
nostalgic sensibility be one of the most recognized and
revered groups on such a progressive campus? The answer
lies in three pillars that define the oldest student organiza-
tion at the University: tradition, camaraderie and musical
excellence.
Although these words may apply to many student groups,
they, through their intertwined relationship, accurately rep-
resent the club as it celebrates its 150th anniversary this year.
The University of Michigan Men's Glee Club will hold their
150th annual fall concert on Nov. 21 at Hill Auditorium.
Founded in 1859 by - according to the website - "six or
eight men," Glee Club membership has grown to around
100, and this number has been held in place by annual fall
and winter auditions.
Some notable accomplishments of the club include
world-wide recognition with four first-place finishes at the
International Music Eisteddfod in Llangollen, Wales (1959,
1963, 1971, 1978) and national admiration when the club
sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Tiger Stadium during
the 1984 World Series.
Winning awards and performing to thousands of people
P0, are just two of many contributors to the Glee Club's long-
standing tradition.

Roman's holiday

Gustave Le Gray's 1865 photo The Beach at Sainte-Adresse is one of the objects on display in "Lens of Impressionism.'

Lasting impressions

UMMA's newest exhibit
highlights artists like
Monet and Degas
By MOLLY MCGUIRE
Daily Arts Writer
An anonymous figure stands alone on a
beach, dwarfed by the
immense landscape Lens of
spread out in front of
him. The sky is a hazy, Impressionism
dreamy blue. Pellucid Saturday
water streaks across through Jan. 3
the expanse of rich At UMMA
golden sand, as mist
sweeps over the scene.
This is the setting for James Abbott
McNeill Whistler's Sea and Rain, the paint-
ing that sparked the idea for the exhibit
"The Lens of Impressionism: Photography
and Painting Along the Normandy Coast,
1850-1874." As a signature piece of the
museum's collection, the Whistler served
as the starting point for the exhibition and
its many avenues of inquiry. A seascape
painted in a chic French coastal town, Sea
and Rain will be surrounded by paintings
and photographs with similar motifs, all
the works depicting the coast of Normandy
in the second half of the 19th century.
The exhibit, however, contains more
than just various depictions of the stylish,
romantic coast of France, and it's not just an
assortment of pictures of far-off sailboats
or waves crashing on cliffs. This exhibi-
tion's narrow chronological focus marks
a specific time and place where exciting
things were happening in the art world.
Between 1850 and 1874, Normandy was
a hotbed of artistic activity. Sweeping
changes in the world - technological, com-
mercial and artistic - merged together to
create a new kind of art. Photography and
painting participated in a dialogue that
became the artist's response to a brave
new modern world. With three inventions,
the art world in the region developed into
something irrevocably different.

"Our notion of speed - of how things
moved - was suddenly and abruptly
changed," said Carole McNamara, the cura-
tor of the exhibition. "This trio of inven-
tions - the railroad, the camera and the
telegraph - collapsed time in a way that
had been completely unthinkable before
these inventions, and it was as completely
overturning to earlier assumptions as the
Internet has been for our time. It was their
huge thing to adapt to."
With the rise of the rail line, the tourism
industry accelerated in places like the coast
of Normandy. Resort towns became stomp-
ing grounds not only for the fashionable
bourgeoisie, but for great photographers
and painters who came to capture the way
light danced on the water. Photographers
explored the new medium, making innova-
tions that inspired many aspects of early
Impressionism.
"The consideration of photography was
influencing both how painters were see-
ing and how they were depicting what they
were seeing," McNamara said.
Techniques like unique forms of crop-
ping or framing often popped up in early
Impressionist paintings, adding to the ser-
endipitous feel that's infused in this type of
art. Painting adapted to confront this new,
faster-moving world.
"It involves this instantaneity, which
in photography meant arresting motion
so you don't get blurs," McNam'ara said.
"Transferred to painting, it means captur-
ing something that might seem incidental.
It feels accidental. But it isn't."
Many pieces in the exhibit are on loan
from Paris's Musde d'Orsay and Biblio-
theque nationale de France. The likes of
Gustave Courbet, Edouard Monet, Edgar
Degas and Claude Monet will be repre-
sented, along with photographers Gustave
Le Gray and Henri Le Secq. These familiar
names will be accompanied by some lesser-
known artists to present a thorough sur-
vey of the art movement in this period and
locale.
"A wonderful thing about the Biblio-
theque nationale's loans is that (they) will
introduce to American audiences photog-

raphers who we have no idea about, artists
who are completely unknown over here,"
McNamara said.
Ephemera from the time period, like
souvenirs from the 1868 World's Fair, will
be displayed as well to give spectators
a sense of what life was like back then.
Scattered throughout the exhibit will be
several comparisons, including paintings
and photographs side by side to show the
intertwining motifs and styles, as well as
academic paintings that set the standard
of the day placed next to the Impressionist
works to show just how shocking this new
type of art could be and must have been at
the time.
"It's easy to forget how outrageous
Impressionist painting was, because it's
become so comfortable and familiar to us,"
McNamara said.
But next to the glossy finish of Salon
paintings, it's clear why the seemingly tame
images of fishing villages and squally skies
caused such a stir. The works in the exhibi-
tion exemplify the free and loose style that
first earned the moniker "Impressionism,"
which was originally tagged onto Monet's
Impression Sunrise with more than a hint
of derision. This format recalls the upset.
accompanying this then-new art form -
one that is commonplace and extremely
marketable today.
Throughout October and November,
there will also be a wide array of programs
to accompany the exhibition for those on the
lookout for more. Three lectures, includ-
ing one by McNamara, go along with the
themes and issues raised by the collection.
Two musical programs are planned as well,
featuring music evoking similar qualities to
Impressionism and music from contempo-
raries of the Impressionists. Lastly, those
inspired by Courbet's La Vague can even
create their own
seascape paint-
ing in a workshop
called "Seascapes:
Exploring the
Horizon." "Lens
of Impressionism"
runs until Jan. 3.

t's official, fashionistas: Lindsay
Lohan is now a seasoned runway
model. Or at least that's the new-
est failed career
trajectory for the
deluded Alcoholics
Anonymous graduate.
Lohan's roles in such
critically acclaimed
bombs as "I Know -
Who Killed Me"
weren't able to cover SASHA
her coke tab and colla- MESENDE
gen injections, so she's
now lookingto spread her dubious sense
of style across the glob.
The failed actress recently strutted on
the Paris Spring/Summer 2010 catwalk
for the Spanish line Emanuel Ungaro,
which recently hired Lohan as its new
creative director. Whoever thought this
Hollywood hot mess has what it takes
to create innovative new looks for a
European clientele needs to put down
the Grey Goose, fast. The newly debuted
line - which was equal parts neon
overkill and back-alley trashiness - was
universally panned by the hoity-toity
European fashion press. Sorry Lindz,
you may want to focus on strengthening
the tacky leggings line you already have
in the United States while you attempt
to get your shit together.
Lilo's atrocious new fashion line isn't
the only American-generated debacle
that has left the French up in arms. n
route to the ZurichFglmn Festival, direc-
tor Roman Polanski was recently nabbed
by the Swiss po-po, cuttingshort plans
to accept a lifetime achievement award
for his Oscar-winning work. Polanksi
has been evading authorities since the
1970s, when he ran off to France, where
he's a citizen, to avoid sentencing on
allegations that he raped a 13-year-old
model. Turns out sex crimes don't have
an expiration date, even when the perp
directed "Chinatown."
While Polanski sits in Swiss custody
awaiting extradition to the United
States, an array of Hollywood hotshots
have come out in favor of the director,
including, of all people, Woody Allen.
Now I loved "Annie Hall" as much as
the next neurotic wannabe New Yorker,
but I don't think that Allen - who
caused a stir of his own when he wed
his own former girlfriend's adopted
daughter - is the person you want on
your side when you're facing child sex
charges. Just some food for thought,
Roman.
The ensuing media spectacle
spawned by Polanski's arrest proves one
thing hasn't changed since the 1970s:
Americans love themselves a good, old-
fashioned sex scandal. Thankfully, the
scandal-craving blogosphere was tossed
another bone last week when late-night
talking head David Letterman admit-
ted on air that a CBS News producer
extorted him for $2 million. The produc-
er allegedly had proof that Letterman
had - oops! - slept with subordinate
employees.
Regardless of whether employer-em-
ployee sexual arrangements are unethi-
cal or just plain creepy, it's definitely
going to be a whole lot more awkward
now whenever Letterman tries to skew-
er politicians for their own sexual dalli-
ances. Letterman has made a career out

of raking public figures over the coals,
hitting a high point during the Monica
Lewinsky proceedings. Somewhere in
rural Alaska, Sarah Palin - who recent-
ly got into a very public dispute with the
comic after he made crude jokes at the
expense of Palin's knocked-up teenage
daughter - is gleefully eating up this lat-
est media shitstorm.
As entertaining as celebrity sex
scandals can be, it's time to move on
to another much-discussed dimension
of celebreality: relationships! Whether
dating, mating or hastily entering ill-
thought-out unions that will be annulled
before the year's end, you can always
rely on our favorite celebrities to allow
us mere mortals to feel a little bit better
about our own dating woes.
The latest celebritard to walk down
the aisle is Khloe Kardashian. If you
don't know who she is, that's OK. Her
older sister stars in a leaked sex tape
and her step-brother has previously

go down in the history books as the

talk; let's focus on budding - albeit,
entirely speculative - relationships
among Hollywood's rising youngstar-

and general British-hottie enthusiasts,
but according to the nation's premiere
celebrity trash rags, Robert Pattinson
is off the market. Or, at the very least,
he's been spending the'majority of his
free time sticking his tongue down the
throat of fellow "Twilight" star Kristen
Stewart. Of course, the two in-demand
stars would never play pretend lovers in
a PR-generated campaign leading up to
November's highly anticipated (at least
in the tween demographic) release of
"New Moon." Nah, that's just pure cyni-
cism. Regardless of whether RPatt and
KStew are actually bumpin' uglies, their
romance - whether real or contrived
- is sure to send a surplus of Hot Topic-
clad teenager girls into seclusion with
tubs of Haagen-Dazs and a mixtape of
pop-rock emo hits.

Not just a kid's 'Story'

By JENNIFER XU
DailyArts Writer
In 1995, before Pixar churned out
multi-million dollar masterpieces
every year, there was "Toy Story."
The film revolutionized CGI film-
making with a style of animation
that paid homage to the artistry of
old school Disney while embracing
the new wave of digital technol-
ogy. "Toy Story" was followed by
a sequel, "Toy Story 2," which was
brighter and fresher than ever.
More colorful masterpieces fol-
lowed - movies about bugs, mon-
sters, fish, superheroes, rats and
robots. These unforgettable films
have transformed Pixar into the
most consistent CGI animation
production company in the world.
Still, wehaven't forgotten the stu-
dio's beginnings. For two weeks
only, Pixar has given us the chance
to watch these 14-year-old classics
back to back in 3-D, and for $10 a
ticket I'd say the money is well
worth it.
When I was little, I remember
sitting in my kitchen patiently
rewinding the videotape to "Toy
Story" by hand when the magnetic
strip suddenly gave out. My mom
had to take me back to Kmart to
buy a new tape. Last weekend, as
I sat in the theater beside adults
reliving their memories and kids

who quite possibly were watching
"Toy Story" for the first time, it all
felt so familiar.
It was funny how easily all the
characters came back to me. It was
like a family reunion with Woody
the cowboy and Buzz Lightyear the
space commander; Spud, Hamm
the piggy bank and Rex; Slinky, Bo
Peep, as well as Jessie the cowgirl,
Bullseye and Stinky Pete the evil
prospector. My brother and I used
to pull consecutive "Toy Story"
marathons like this all the time,
watching the first followed by the
second followed by the first and
Why I cry
at CGI.
so on. By the fourth time around I
would start to get sick of the mov-
ies, but that didn't stop me from
starting over again the next week.
I always preferred the sequel to
the original. To thisday, "Toy Story
2" remains my favorite gem in Pix-
ar's star-studded repertoire, and
watching it again I was reminded
that no matter how sophisticated
or environmentally conscious the
company gets, nothing can replace
the utter simplicity of toys trying
to find their way back home to a

little boy who loves them.
It's a film inextricably linked to
my childhood - I watched "Toy
Story 2" before I watched "Star
Wars." In the sequel, Pixar seems
more comfortable taking risks and
injecting pop-culture humor into

®j REMY ZERO 'VILLA ELAINE' (1998)
Finding its own timeK

6

By SHARON JACOBS
For the Daily
Remember 1998? Climbing the
charts were Green Day's "Good
Riddance (Time of Your Life)" and
"Tearin' Up My Heart" by *NSYNC
- the industry was dominated by
punk-tinged alt rock and tween-
darling boy bands. The "Titanic"
soundtrack was the top-selling
albumofthe year and alittle-known
band called Remy Zero released
Villa Elaine, an otherworldly and
gritty album that just didn't fit in.
More famous for penning "Save
Me" (better known as "that song
from 'Smallville' "), Remy Zero's
more seminal '90s work has gone
largely unnoticed. Villa Elaine was
the result of the Alabama-based
group's two-year hole-up in a run-
down Los Angeles motel of the
same name. We've all heard the
story of the wide-eyed artists who
came to the city looking to make it
big. But as Remy Zero demonstrates
on Villa, these five Southern boys
are not your average idealists.
Lyrically, the album presents a
bleak landscape while simultane-
ously beaconing hope - a cathar-
tically contradictory stance that's
embodied in the chorus of the first
song, "Hermes Bird" - "So hold
to your permanent bliss / in the
time that it takes to exist / From
the hours to the fall of it / It's all
right, you're all wrong." The track's
overpowering confusion funnels
into a simple and vaguely positive
message. Even "Life in Rain," the
album's biggest downer, finds sing-
er Cinjun Tate proclaiming, "So
when it comes down / you'll know
rm with you." Villa Elaine oper-

From Page 3B
Barbie and Emperor Zurg say-
ing "No Buzz, I am your father" -
solidifying the production studio's
image as a purveyor of magical kid's
films made for adults.
During the intermission, Pixar
treated us to creepy footage of the
infant stages of Woody and Buzz
Lightyear (then dubbed "Tempus
from Morph"). Woody is a drawl-
ing, drooling mess of a cowboy and
"Tempus" 's mouth doesn't move
properly. Thank goodness Pixar
fixed that snafu or else the studio
might've gained an entirely differ-
ent household reputation - one for
unintentionally making children's
horror films.
Although I wouldn't say the
3-D really adds a great deal to the
films, it doesn't take away anything
either. Henry Selick's "Coraline" set
the gold standard for 3-0 anima-
tion transcending dimensions, and
"Toy Story 3-D" doesn't come any-
where close to meeting this prec-
edent. Even still, it's refreshing that
Pixar didn't succumb to the showy,
headache-inducing gimmicks that
most 3-D films possess. While the
characters don't exactly "pop out
of the screen" as advertised, there
are moments ofshivering awesome-
ness. The camera careens upward
to reveal "The Claw" looming down
upon the worshiping aliens. Buzz
Lightyear spins off the ceiling and
loops around a model car racetrack,
only to land upright on his feet. Still,
the benefits of watching this double
feature don't lie in the 3-D effects,
but rather in the magic of reliving a
childhood masterpiece.
In contrast to "Wall-E," which
was a biting commentary on the
ubiquity of mass-marketed mer-
chandise, "Toy Story" seeks out the
softer sides of globalization, exam-
ining how a mass-produced toy can
be a simple joy in a kid's life, and
how a kid can be a simple joy in a
toy's life. We put our own souls into

our toys, and no matter how much
we accidentally abused them or out-
grew them, we still loved them. We
constructed elaborate scenarios in
which the hero encountered insur-
mountable obstacles only to get the
girl. Before we all promptly turned
into cynics upon reaching puberty,
we were storytellers - idealistic
champions of the imagination. "Toy
Story" captures that childhood
spirit in the highest degree.
"Toy Story 2" was the first movie I
ever cried at. The moment when Jes-
sie the cowgirl relives memories of
an owner long grown-up while Sarah
McLachlan's "When She Loved Me"
swells up in the background (I have
this song on my iPod - don't judge)
remains one of the most powerful
scenes in my movie memory. Years
later, the scene still doesn't fail to get
me. I had to take offmy3-D glassesto
wipe my tears away.
"Toy Story" is a film about child-
hood. It's about your childhood, my
childhood, Pixar's childhood and
our collective childhood. It's about
what you wish your toys did when
you weren't around. The movies
makeyouwantruntoyourattic,pull
out all your dusty playthings and
transport yourself back to elemen-

tary school. Back then, a yard sale
was a battleground, a trip down-
stairs seemed like a covert mission
and cars moved so damn fast. "Toy
Story" is a perfect encapsulation of
youth's perceptions, reminding you
of whatyou were like when you first
watched it. It reflects a time when
you thought you too could go "to
infinity and beyond."

be the crowning jewel in this trio of
childhood celebration.

inappropriate - but the harmony! Oh, the harmony
in that wonderful echo chamber."
Business senior and current member Anthony
Ambroselli explained a little less spontaneous but
equally unforgettable moment.
"A favorite recent concert memory was during our
trip to Spain last spring," he explained.
"In C6rdoba, the Glee Club was featured as the
final attraction of the town's music festival. We sang
in a small church for a (house full) of people far over
the building's capacity. The energy in that venue was
indescribable - the audience was thrilled to have us
and that, in turn, fed the energy of that particular
performance.
"During the third encore, we sang 'La Tarara,' a
traditional Spanish folksong. Upon conclusion, the
entire audience immediately began applauding us in
a uniform rhythm of triplets," Abroselli said. "One
man in the front row exclaimed 'Viva laUniversidad
de Michigan!' It was a very unique cultural experi-
ence, really showing us how easily music can tran-
scend cultural and linguistic boundaries."
At times, the club has exceeded its role as pro-
moter of the University, and acted as representative
of the United States. In 2003, during a tour in the
British Isles, former director and current associate
professor of voice in the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance Stephen Lusmann described the experience
of performing on behalf of the entire country.
"My fondest memory was our overseastour of Ire-
land and the United Kingdom," he said.
"This tour was during one of the lowest points of
the Iraq War: the scandal at Abu Ghraib. The Men's
Glee Club always thinks of itself as (an ambassa-
dor) for the University of Michigan, but this was a
time when we were truly ambassadors of the United
States.
"There were times during the tour when some of
us had awkward moments on the street or in pubs
with locals voicing their dislike of the war in Iraq
and that the United States 'dragged the United King-
dom into the conflict,"' Lusmann said.
"However, after a concert at St. James Church
in London many audience members expressed very
emotionally their love for our concert and how we
were the best ambassadors of goodwill the United
States could have sent to Europe at that time."
MORE MEMORIES
Some other defining instances for a past and pres-
ent director range from hilarious to heart-wrench-
ing..
Bloom described the rush of celebrity approval of
the club.
"The movie star Gene Kelly ("Singin' in the Rain")
received an honorary degree from the University at
a Winter Commencement in 1987," he explained.
"The club sang for the commencement exercises.
When the ceremony ended, President (Harold) Sha-
piro and Kelly led the recessional from the speaker's
platform. Gene Kelly broke rank, came over to the
place where the Glee Club sang, shook my hand and
said 'That was terrific. Thank you.' I still have not
washed my hand," Bloom said.
Current Director Dr. Paul Rardin said, "The'best
example I've witnessed of what Glee Club has'meant
to its members came from a first-year student dur-
ing his end-of-tour speech to fellow members. He
described the way in which our performing a piece

about death (set to Walt Whitman's poem 'Invoca-
tion,' which welcomes death as a relief from suf-
fering) helped him come to grips with the sudden
death of a close friend of his," Rardin said.
"I was overwhelmed with emotion at watching
this brave student - still new to the Glee Club and
surrounded by students who had been members for
two, three and four years - stand and speak about
something so powerful and so personal. The only
way he could have arrived at that emotional stage
was by feeling so comfortable with both the music
and the members of the Glee Club. From what I
could tell the Glee Club had become his social and
spiritual home."
CAMARADERIE
National and international tours mark the
amount of time group members spend together, but
lifelong friendships are sparked right here in Ann
Arbor. The second pillar is formed after an exhaust-
ing rehearsal on Thursday night, club members
will venture over to Cottage Inn and unwind, never
ceasing their singing.
Although it's difficult to put into words, the club's
focus on camaraderie is always apparent and lasts
well beyond the college years.
"You know, it's a special fraternity, a special band
of brothers," Ramsey explained. "Like guys in the
military, maybe, who go through unique and excit-
ing experiences together, there's an incredibly con,
nective bond that's built, one that never breaks."
MUSICAL EXCELLENCE
Tradition and camaraderie aside, Lusmann may
have said it best:
"(Glee Club) is an organizationcthatdraws togeth-
er men from every school in the University for one
reason: their love of singing."
Dr. Rardin explained how he upholds the third
pillar of the Glee Club.
"The steps I take to ensure musical excellence
are nurturing a sense of energy and joy whenever
we sing," he said, "which includes showing my own
enthusiasm for the music; nurturing a basic under-
standing of the words in a piece of music, not just its
music (we will sing our best when we understand
the text and context of a piece); insisting on excel-
lent rehearsal protocol from every member; apply-
ing for performances at regional and national music
conferences - audiences at these conferences are
all, professional musicians, so this ups the musical
ante," he explained.
THE NEXT 150 YEARS
Although this year celebrates the past150years of
the club, Quakenbush likes to think of it as atime to
look forward to the next 150 years. Reaching out to
the community factors heavily into this equation.
"We have begun to regularly make music for
patients in the University's hospital system, reach
out to local urban high schools through our choral
mentorship program and pursue relationships with
local assisted living facilities," he said.
With a century and a half of tradition under its
belt, hundreds of thousands of relationships formed
and alevel of perfection in singing measured only by
its own high standards, the Glee Club should have
no problem maintaining its high ranking among
campus organizations and its standing as an elite
collegiate choir.
As Rardin said, "It is excitingto be part of a story
that is still being written."
