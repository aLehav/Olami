Zeta 
Beta 
Tau’s 

International 
Headquarters 

voted to remove recognition of 
the University of Michigan’s 
Eta chapter on Tuesday.

According to an official 

statement 
from 
the 

organization, ZBT staff, along 
with the University’s Office 
of Greek Life and Division for 
Student Life, conducted an 
extensive membership review 
to determine the future of the 
chapter.

“Through the course of this 

investigation it became clear 
that members were violating 
various Fraternity policies, 

including those which prohibit 
hazing,” the statement read.

ZBT 
International 

leadership ended the pledging 
process in 1989 in an effort to 
prevent hazing.

The actions of the brothers 

of the Colony at the University 
of 
Michigan 
violated 
our 

policies and acted in ways 
antithetical to our mission 
and values,” the statement 
read. “Health and safety is 
a top priority of Zeta Beta 
Tau, and we are committed 
to 
facilitating 
a 
positive 

fraternity experience.”

This 
decision 
follows 

the 
recent 
reinstatement 

of social activities by the 
Interfraternity 
Council 

On Tuesday evening in the 

University’s Weiser Hall, 100 
years and one day since President 
Woodrow Wilson delivered his 
famous “Fourteen Points” speech, 
used to negotiate peace talks to 
end Word War I, Ambassador 
Daniel Fried delivered his own 
five points outlining how the 
United States should address the 
challenges of promoting Western 
strategy in Central Europe.

Regent 
Ron 
Weiser, 
R, 

introduced Ambassador Fried to 
the podium as he recounted their 
work together when Ambassador 
Fried was the head of the National 
Security Council for Europe 
and Eurasia in 2001. Weiser 
emphasized the impact Fried has 
had on international affairs over 
his forty year career in foreign 
service.

“This man has had enormous 

influence on the shape of Europe 
as we see it today,” he said. “A 
Europe whole and free, mostly 
whole and mostly free, and that is 
a product of much of the work he 
did for many many years.”

Today, Fried is a fellow at the 

Atlantic Council, an organization 
that works to address global 
challenges by helping to inform 
strategy 
among 
international 

leaders.

Fried’s lecture was attended 

by about fifty people ranging 
from 
undergraduate 
students 

with a developing interest in 
policy to several of Fried’s former 
colleagues 
including 
Weiser 

and Public Policy Prof. Melvyn 
Levitsky. 

The 
lecture 
opened 
with 

Fried’s 
admiration 
for 
the 

sustained success of American 
foreign policy, while also noting 
the potential risk of leaving the 
Russian government unchecked.

“Under American leadership, 

the West enjoyed its longest 
period of general peace since 
Roman times, an unprecedented 
prosperity in democracy,” he 
said. “Security challenges and 

attempted subversion from Russia 
is not new. What is alarming, 
and dismaying are the doubts 
and divisions within the West. A 
questioning of our own model, of 
our own values.”

Fried’s lecture continued to 

detail the events of the latter half of 
the 20th century and the current 
challenges both Central European 
countries and the United States 
face including economic stress, 
political stagnation, and questions 
of national identity. Through 

a historical lens, which Fried 
credited to his undergraduate 
days at Cornell majoring in 
history, he laced historical strife 
with its modern consequences.

“As Brexit, the Front Nationale, 

and other right-wing movements 
demonstrate, 
the 
prevailing 

post-national political culture in 
Western Europe is not always as 
popular as people think inside the 
Brussels beltway and it does not 
speak for the whole nation,” he 

A University research team 

has created a device to combat 
tinnitus, 
a 
condition 
that 

causes ringing in the ears, 
which affects 15 percent of 
Americans and is caused by 
nerve activity in the brain.

According to the Center for 

Disease Control,tinnitus leaves 
two million people unable to 
work and is the most common 
cause 
of 
service-connected 

disability 
among 
veterans. 

While the condition has no 
cure, the device helps improve 
the quality of life for those who 
suffer from it. 

Tinnitus is often a result of 

nerve damage from things such 
as a loud concert or a gunshot, 
according to Medical School 
Prof. Susan Shore, who led the 
research team. Shore and her 
team identified a way in which 
touch and sound can relieve 
the occurrence of ringing.

“Combining the stimulation 

of the somatosens with the 
auditory systems … showed that 
a particular combination of 
sound and the somatosensory 
stimulation

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: OLD MAIN HOSPITAL WALLS COME DOWN 

Jan 11, 1989 

By Dan Godson
Daily Staff Reporter 

When an eight-ton demolition 

ball 
tore 
into 
the 
former 

Neuropsychiatric 
Institute 

of the University’s Old Main 
Hospital complex yesterday, it 
symbolically started the end of 
an era. 

The 63-year old building has 

been doomed for years, since the 
University began planning for its 
eventual replacement. 

The estimated cost for the 

demolition project— which is 
expected to be completed in 
July— is in excess of $8 million, 
said Paul Spradlin, University 

Direction of Plant Extension 
and director of the demolition 
project. This includes removal 
of asbestos and the basement, 
restoration of the site, and 
replacement of the grass. 

The University’s Board of 

Regents decided in January 
of 1987 that it would be more 
cost-efficient to demolish the 
old building than to spend 
the estimated $3.2 million to 
maintain it. 

Since then, “Old Main” has 

slowly been readied for its 
demolition days. Although it was 
originally slated for demolition 
by 
explosives, 
O’Rourke 

Construction 
Company 
of 

Cinncinnati is demolishing it 
with a series of wrecking ball 
strikes in an attempt to save 

money.

Most time consuming was the 

removal of asbestos from the 
building’s structure. “You can’t 
demolish (the building) until the 
asbestos is removed,” Spralin 
said. 

The asbestos removal took 

several months because it was 
in the “insulation pipes, floor 
tiles, doors, and just about 
everything,” Spradlin said. 

After 
the 
new 
University 

Hospital was opened in 1986, the 
7500,000 square-foot Old Main 
building was vacated. 

Nothing is scheduled to fill 

the site after it is cleared, but 
the “land will be available for 
construction in the future,” said 
Regent Deane Baker (R-Ann 
Arbor). 

Deer cull opponents fired 

back at City Council members 
Monday night armed with 
LED-clad 
posters 
spelling 

“#SAVE THE DEER.” The 
protest was staged on Huron 
Street outside Ann Arbor City 
Hall coinciding with the first 
City Council meeting of 2018.

Approximately 
16 
people 

attended the protest organized 
by Friends of Ann Arbor 

Wildlife and Nature.

Despite 
the 
flashiness, 

FAAWN members viewed the 
protest as a somber occasion, 
marking the start of the three-
week deer cull season. They 
described the event as a “vigil.”

The 
deer 
cull 
was 

established by the city of Ann 
Arbor in 2016 to manage local 
deer populations. This year 
the city will devote $35,940 of 
budget to hire sharpshooters 
from 
White 
Buffalo 
Inc. 

who are permitted to kill a 
maximum of 250 deer. The 
cull permit is issued by the 

Michigan 
Department 
of 

Natural Resources.

FAAWN member Lorraine 

Shapiro shared her perspective 
regarding the deer cull with 
council members.

“This is the day that I and 

others 
have 
been 
outside, 

hoping to see our deer — and 
we know our deer by how they 
look — one last time before 
they are killed,” Shapiro said 
to MLive. “This is the day that 
I wish I did not live in Ann 
Arbor. And this is the day you 
should not be very proud of 
yourself for your rush to kill 

and your disregard of public 
safety”

One of the chief concerns 

expressed 
by 
FAAWN 

members is the safety of those 
whose property is close to one 
of the designated shooting 
zones.

According to MLive, council 

members 
did 
not 
respond 

to the protesters, but some 
supporters 
driving 
by 
the 

demonstration participated by 
honking their horns. 

With 
Michigan’s 

gubernatorial 
election 

looming 
ahead, 
Progress 

Michigan, 
a 
Lansing-based 

progressive organization that 
works to hold government 
officials accountable, is calling 
on Michigan Attorney General 
Bill Schuette to investigate Lt. 
Gov. Brian Calley’s absences 
from the state Senate in 2013 
and 2014.

In his state constitutional 

role as president of the state 
Senate, Calley missed 61 of 
177 session days to travel to 
Harvard University one day 
a week to pursue a master’s 

degree in public administration 
from 
Harvard’s 
Kennedy 

School of Government.

Calley said he was paying 

for the transportation and 
education himself, although 
Progress Michigan says it is 
now questioning whether he 
used public funds to pay for 
these expenses.

Progress Michigan is also 

asking Schuette to investigate 
if Calley ever paid the state 
back for missing a third of 
Senate session days. In a recent 
press release, Lonnie Scott, 
executive director of Progress 
Michigan, says it is essential 
to know if Calley put in the 
proper amount of work for 
taxpayers.

“Bill Schuette has the power 

to get to the truth of the matter 
and let us know if Calley was 
serving himself instead of 
working for the people of 
Michigan and if he ever paid 
back the state for hours he was 
off when he should have been 
working for taxpayers,” she 
said.

Though the story of Calley’s 

absences 
broke 
in 
2014, 

Schuette 
never 
questioned 

Calley for his absences, and 
they ran on the same ticket in 
the 2014 gubernatorial race.

Now Calley is running for 

the Republican gubernatorial 
nomination against Schuette 
and is joining Democrats in 
publicly criticizing Schuette 
for having political staffers on 
the state payroll.

Calley is calling on Schuette 

to 
take 
four 
“constituent 

relations” staffers off of the 
state payroll, and Progress 
Michigan is separately arguing 
that Schuette is violating U.S. 
law.

“Forcing 
taxpayers 
to 

subsidize any officeholder’s 
political ambition is a clear 
and 
disturbing 
breach 
of 

the 
public’s 
trust,” 
Calley 

said in a public statement. 
“Attorney General Schuette 
should immediately move the 
gubernatorial campaign field 
staff exposed in the story off 
the government payroll and 
refund the state for all taxpayer 
funds that were misspent on 
political purposes.”

The University has opened 

its second Clinical Simulation 
Center, 
a 
7,500-square-foot 

space 
located 
in 
Medical 

Science 
Building 
II. 
The 

new center goes beyond the 
original, 
smaller 
facility, 

allowing more than double 

the amount of professionals 
and students to train in a 
simulation environment.

The 
second 
Clinical 

Simulation Center is equipped 
with 
state-of-the-art 

technology, such as various 
adult and child mannequins 
which have the ability to talk, 
cry, breathe and have full 
heart and lung sounds. These 

mannequins respond to the 
different medical interventions 
that may be practiced by those 
training there. The technology 
allows professionals to train 
for real-life scenarios in a low-
risk environment.

At 
the 
new 
facility, 

computer-based 
simulation 

lessons 
guide 
students, 

physicians 
and 
nurses 

through practice exams 
and material. There are 
five 
inpatient 
rooms 

that imitate those in the 
University Hospital, C.S. 
Mott Children’s Hospital 
and 
Von 
Voigtlander 

Women’s Hospital. Such 
rooms create a realistic 
environment, in efforts to 
mimic real life scenarios 
as closely as possible. 

Dr. James Cooke is an 

associate 
professor 
of 

learning health sciences 
and 
family 
medicine 

and 
the 
executive 

director of the Clinical 
Simulation 
Center. 
He 

is a firm believer in the 
effectiveness of simulation 
learning. 
In 
a 
press 

release, 
he 
highlighted 

how simulation learning 
allows 
interdisciplinary 

teams to work together, 
as well as provide and 
receive valuable feedback.

“Debriefing 
allows 

learners to reflect on and 
discuss 
their 
medical 

decisions 
and 
allows 

expert 
facilitators 
to 

guide 
teams 
to 
improve 

communication, 
efficiency 

and 
overall 
performance,” 

Cooke said. “Intentional and 
well-designed practice leads to 
better outcomes.”

Nursing junior Rachel Sabin 

also believes in the power of 
simulation learning.

“The opportunity to learn 

from your mistakes is priceless 
in the nursing field,” Sabin said. 
“Working 
through 
realistic 

clinical scenarios side-by-side 
with my instructor has taught 
me to think critically and 
practice the skills that I learn 
in lecture.”

The 
School 
of 
Nursing 

as a whole has shown its 
commitment 
to 
simulation 

learning, 
opening 
a 
new 

building in the fall of 2015 
that includes six simulation 
rooms. This allows students 
to practice real-life situations 
they may encounter while 
working with patients. 

Sabin is currently in her 

obstetrics 
rotation, 
during 

which she spends six hours 
each week in the Nursing 
School’s simulation center.

“I 
feel 
so 
much 
more 

confident 
when 
I 
am 

interacting with ‘real’ patients 
at the hospital,” Sabin said. 
“The new simulation center 
will allow even more students 
to 
refine 
their 
skills 
and 

ultimately 
improve 
patient 

safety.”

Warmer weather melts student-made snowmen at the Diag on Tuesday. 

SNOW NO SNOW 

said. “All of this took place against 
a backdrop of massive social and 
economic transformation resulting 
from free-market reforms.”

Fried ended his lecture with 

a succinct five points — which 
he admitted were much easier to 
envision than to put into action. 
Broadly 
outlined, 
the 
points 

included the need for the United 
States to “show up” and present 
strategy, 
establish 
a 
message 

nuanced with sensitivity, defend 
Central 
Europeans 
against 

Russia’s offensive tactics, notify 
governments 
when 
they 
are 

risking democratic values and 
maintain the position as a leader of 
the free world.

Following the lecture, Fried 

engaged 
with 
the 
audience 

during a 40-minute question and 
answer session. One audience 
member asked Fried the meaning 
of 
American 
leadership 
and 

how the phrase is embodied in 
international affairs. 

“American leadership means 

having our power in the window 
so everyone can see it, but not 
talking about that — talking about 
our vision of the world,” Fried 
responded. 

Engineer junior Neil Karr 

said he appreciated the novelty 
of how Fried defined American 
leadership.

“It was kind of reassuring to 

hear that there is a purpose to our 
leadership and to our values and 
that it is okay to have strong belief 
in your values if you think they are 
right,” he said.

Public Policy senior Gabriel 

Lerner was also in attendance and 
said Fried’s analysis of a successful 
democracy resonated with him.

“I think the point that he 

closed with that the successes of 
democracies in Poland are shared 
between liberal and conservative 
governments, sort of democracy 
is not of a party, but it is of a 
constitution, and a system, and a 
history,” Lerner said. “I thought 
that that was really compelling.”

depress the firing of these 
neurons,” Shore said.

The researchers identified 

the intervals of sound and 
orders of touch that caused the 
depression of the firing nerves. 
They took that information 
and used it to stimulate the 
same nerves on a guinea pig 
for 20 minutes per day for 
25 days. The results showed 
a reduction in the firing of 
the cells, thus reducing the 
tinnitus in the animals.

“We 
use 
guinea 
pigs 

because 
they 
are 
a 
good 

model for auditory research 
because their … peripheral 
auditory system is similar to 
humans,” Shore said. “Also 
their brains are easy to access 
for recordings.”

After seeing its success in 

guinea pigs, scientists took 
the experiment to humans, 
creating a non-invasive way 
to stimulate human auditory 
nerves for 30 minutes per day. 
In the 20-person trial, each 
subject was given a box with 

wires 
attaching 
electrodes 

that connect to the face or 
neck and an earphone.

In order for the device to 

work, scientists must program 
it to fit the subject’s unique 
tinnitus patterns and pitch. 
Inaccuracy in the device could 
worsen the subject’s tinnitus.

The success of this trial 

provides 
insight 
into 
the 

science 
of 
the 
brain 
and 

auditory system.The hope is 
that this research can be used 
to help others with auditory 
disorders. The research team 
received funding in the fall 
from the National Institutes of 
Health for a larger 50-subject 
study. Following the larger 
trial, 
the 
team 
plans 
to 

commercialize the product, 
which it already has patented.

“This tells us a lot about 

how the circuitry in the brain 
changes after noise damage 
and tells us how the auditory 
system works in general, so 
that can end up helping other 
kinds of hearing disorders as 
well,” Shore said.

But according to a Gizmodo 

article about the device, it has 
its limitations. Following the 
end of the trial, much of the 
tinnitus returned in subjects. 

The study also only worked 
with those with a specific 
form of tinnitus, so this means 
that the device might not work 
for 20 percent to 40 percent of 
its sufferers.

“The 
subjects’ 
tinnitus 

largely returned a week after 
they stopped using the device, 
even for the two people who 
reported losing it completely,” 
according to the Gizmodo 
article.

Business sophomore Jordan 

Stanton often spends time 
around loud music as a student 
DJ at WCBN radio station 
and member of the Michigan 
Electronic Music Collective, 
and he fears the effects of 
tinnitus.

“I was basically told by a 

close friend with tinnitus 
who played the violin that 
I 
should 
be 
very 
careful 

about listening to loud music 
consistently,” Stanton said. “I 
recently decided to purchase 
some 
hearing-protecting 

earbuds to use during DJ sets 
and concerts to avoid tinnitus 
onset.”

following a two month long self-
imposed ban. The committee 
voted to suspend all social 
events 
following 
multiple 

hazing 
and 
sexual 
assault 

allegations involving fraternity 
brothers. 
Twenty-seven 

fraternities, 
including 
ZBT, 

were given specific action plans 
in order to regain their social 
privileges.

A statement obtained by The 

Daily, on behalf of the Michigan 
chapter of ZBT, confirms the 
members were given an action 
plan and were willing to work 
with the IFC to make necessary 
changes. The revoking of their 
official charter came as a 
complete surprise to chapter. 

“We were given sanctions 

and a rehabilitation plan by 
the normal IFC process and 
the university, we were fully 
willing 
to 
abide 
by 
those 

sanctions, then were blindsided 

by this decision from ZBT 
national,” the statement read. 
“The reasoning we were given 
was minimal, and was certainly 
a culmination of unreasonable 
ongoing frustration between 
national and us.”

The IFC worked with the 

Office of Greek Life to review 
fraternity 
guidelines 
for 

social events and develop a 
reformation 
process. 
Some 

changes include the removal of 
hard alcohol from IFC events 
and limiting social activities to 
specific days of the week.

University 
spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen confirmed 
in an email correspondence 
the decision to revoke the 
national was made by ZBT’s 
headquarters.

“Yes, the university is aware 

of the situation and the Dean of 
Students office is working with 
the 
students,” 
Broekhuizen 

wrote.

ZBT’s 
Eta 
chapter 
was 

shut down in 2012 following 
a claim from the fraternity 
headquarters 
that 
the 

University chapter had become 
an “unsafe environment.” An 
anonymous member at the time 
told The Daily these claims 
were not substantiated. ZBT 
was removed from the IFC in 
2006, but remained on campus 
as an official chapter of ZBT 
International. 
The 
chapter 

had been expelled for violating 
their one-year suspension by 
recruiting new members. ZBT 
had also been suspended once 
before in 2000 for a hazing 
incident that resulted in a 
pledge being burned by bleach.

According to the chapter’s 

Facebook page the University’s 
Eta chapter was “re-colonized” 
in 
2016. 
The 
chapter 
was 

an official member of the 
University’s 
Interfraternal 

Council 
inducting 
its 
first 

pledge class in February 2016.

The company will debut at 

CES to introduce itself to the 
consumer market. Last year, 
more 
than 
184,000 
people 

attended and 4,000 companies 
had exhibits –– Eu said he 
would use it to gauge consumer 
interests.

“We see it as an opportunity 

because these people traveled 
there...they bring stuff there 
and they want everything to 
be productive,” Eu said. “With 
180,000 people coming, we are 
trying to watch out for interests 
of the market share.”

In 
an 
attempt 
to 
gain 

customers from an obvious base, 
the company will also offer a 
50% off code to University of 
Michigan students and alumni 
for the first three months of 
usage.

Anne Perigo, the Associate 

Director for the Zell Lurie 
Institute at the Ross School 
of 
Business, 
has 
advised 

Eu 
on 
his 
entrepreneurial 

journey since his first year 

at the University. She also 
mentored the development of 
Carrycott, another company Eu 
co-founded. Carrycott offers 
strollers designed to be easily 
carried with one hand and 
cooling technology to prevent 
children from being hot or 
uncomfortable while in the 
stroller.

In an email to The Daily, 

Perigo described her excitement 
about Eu’s new endeavor.

“Benjamin 
is 
a 
great 

role 
model 
to 
other 

entrepreneurially-minded 
students at Michigan,” Perigo 
wrote. “He is willing to put in 
the hard work necessary to be 
successful and smart enough 
to really listen (to potential 
customers, coaches, advisors, 
judges) to know when to pivot 
or move on to a different idea/
venture. I look forward to 
seeing his success as a serial 
entrepreneur.”

While 
he 
anticipates 

difficulty with attending school 
and managing his company, Eu 
remains optimistic of his ability 

to balance his time between the 
two because of the way he and 
Yong will manage the company.

“I will mainly be managing 

the technological and backend 
side of the operations while 
my co-founder will be in the 
state 
managing 
the 
drivers 

and 
operations,” 
Eu 
said. 

“That’s helpful for us because 
we are able to connect with 
the developers and develop 
the product while staying in 
school.”

LSA freshman Kate Sherwin 

welcomes 
the 
idea 
of 
the 

company. While she is not a 
business traveler, she resides 
out-of-state and would find the 
service helpful for moving in 
and out of campus.

“I think that a lot of people 

coming 
off 
airports 
don’t 

really want to deal with a lot 
of 
luggage,” 
Sherwin 
said. 

“Especially for me when I 
was moving into school, my 
family had to carry four or 
five suitcases...especially for 
students, it’s a great product 
and a great company.”

individual CSG members.

CSG also emphasized their 

launch of INNOVATE, the very 
first university-wide public 
service pitch competition, and 
discussed how to publicize 
the event and reach a larger 
audience. LSA senior Cassie 
Fields, CSG communications 
director, 
explained 
how 

students will be given the 
opportunity 
to 
work 
with 

mentors on their project ideas 
in an email sent to The Daily. 

“The 
upcoming 
public 

service 
pitch 
competition, 

INNOVATE, 
creates 

opportunities for students to 
further their efforts in public 
service, 
entrepreneurship, 

and other issues they are 
passionate 
about,” 
Fields 

wrote. “Students will be given 
the chance to network with 
other students to form teams, 
listen to speakers, and receive 
guidance from mentors on their 
proposed 
ideas. 
Following 

multiple rounds of judging, 
the top teams will be awarded 
funding from CSG, the Center 
for 
Entrepreneurship, 
and 

University of Michigan Library 
to continue their work.”

Many representatives were 

elected 
to 
new 
positions, 

including 
LSA 
sophomore 

Isabel Baer and LSA freshman 
Pragya Thakur, Baer to vice 
speaker of the Assembly and 
Thakur to chair of academic 
affairs commission. 

Baer 
emphasized 
how 

her experience in CSG has 
encouraged her to speak up 
and feel confident in voicing 
her opinions, and spoke of 
her plans to implement a 
mentorship program within 
CSG to promote new member’s 
mental health and confidence, 
in her position as Vice Speaker 
of the Assembly.

 
Thakur 
said 
plans 
to 

implement 
LSA’s 
race 
and 

ethnicity requirement across 
all 
schools, 
and 
aims 
to 

make calculators accessible 
for students to rent from 
the library as her position 
as chair of academic affairs 
commission.

LSA senior Sujay Shetty, 

chief of staff to the president 
and Engineering senior AJ 
Ashman, chief of staff to the 
vice 
president, 
announced 

their 
resignation 
due 
to 

conflict of interest in other 
organizations, effective Jan. 
15. Both reflected on their 
time and positive experience 
at 
CSG, 
and 
Ashman 

emphasized the importance of 
the organization.

“The 
potential 
to 
bring 

about change on this campus 
is not equal to anywhere else 
besides this room,” he said.

CSG aims to implement 

change 
this 
semester 
by 

reaching 
out 
to 
larger 

audiences 
through 
social 

media 
strategies 
such 
as

she wasn’t planning to come 
back in the fall and at the last 
minute “they were all (she) had 
to choose from.”

Business alum Liz Herrick 

described 
her 
chaotic 

experiences 
with 
Cribspot. 

She said there was a lack of 
communication with staff, the 
house was not cleaned at move-in 
and she had to threaten litigation 
multiple times. 

 “I’m not surprised they’re 

closing. 
They 
just 
couldn’t 

manage what they took on,” she 
said.

The timing of the closing of 

Cribspot came as a shock to 

those in the housing business. In 
an email interview, Jon Keller, 
president of J. Keller Properties, 
said he would have expected the 
company to close at a different 
time.

“The 
closing 
of 
cribspot 

came as a surprise to us at J 
Keller Properties,” he wrote. “I 
expected this to come during a 
softening of the rental market- 
not at its peak.”

Furthermore, 
he 
said 

relatively little is known about 
the cause of Cribspot closing.

“I don’t know if it was a 

calculated closure or if the ‘rent 
guarantee’ was a cause,” he said.

According 
to 
Cribspot’s 

website, their “rent guaruntee” 
ensures 
landlords 
of 
their 

properties 
will 
recieve 
100 

percent of the rent they charge, 
regardless 
of 
whether 
the 

property has tennants. 

“You’ll receive the rent you 

want, no matter what, even if 
we struggle to find tennants or 
if our tennants stop paying,” 
their 
website 
states. 
‘‘It’s 

your ensurance policy against 
vacancies.” 

While 
the 
reasons 
for 

Cribspot’s 
closing 
remain 

unknown, Keller speculated as 
to what factors may have led to 
the closing of the company — one 
such factor being its management 
model.

“We had a feeling the Cribspot 

model was not sustainable based 
on the guarantees they made and 
rates they charged,” Keller said.

An ex-employee of Cribspot, 

who 
requested 
to 
remain 

anonymous, explained a similar 
theory behind Cribspot’s closing.

“Essentially what happened 

— to the best of my knowledge — 
is that the company was kind of 
going in two different directions, 
one more tech oriented and the 
other more concerned with the 
physical business of Ann Arbor 
housing management,” he said. 
“With this in mind it was starting 
to look less feasible for the latter 
to continue functioning if the 
company was to follow these two 
separate paths.”

Keller affirmed this point, 

adding limited experience may 
also have played a role in the 
difficulties faced by Cribspot.

“I really liked the founders 

and 
the 
disruption 
they 

caused, but cribspot was a 
tech company first- with very 
limited experience in property 
management,” he said.

Nick Hume, a property owner, 

agreed 
with 
this 
statement, 

saying that a lack of property 
management 
knowledge 

in 
Cribspot 
contributed 
to 

the 
difficulties 
his 
tenants 

complained of.

“They needed experience,” he 

said.

The 
house-leasing 
market 

offers 
many 
hurdles 
for 

newcomers to overcome, and 
those who have been in the 
market for a long time, such 
as Keller, believe it is difficult 
to stand out in the industry of 
housing management.

“With that limited brokerage 

experience 
and 
a 
lack 
of 

supporting maintenance teams, 
it was certainly an uphill battle 
for them in a unusually tough 
college market,” Keller said.

The 
anonymous 
employee 

agreed.

“My opinion is that there 

was a lot of young energy in the 
office, a lot of millennials, and 
a lot of bright futures, although 
I somehow doubt that many of 
us will make our names in the 
housing management industry,” 
the employee said.

I’m not surprised 
they’re closing. 

They just couldn’t 
manage what they 

took on.


W

e all know, and 
dread, 
the 
Fall 

Career 
Expo 

put on by the University of 
Michigan’s 
Career 
Center. 

The ballroom in the Michigan 
Union is always packed with 
nervous 
college 
students 

trying to get an internship 
or a full-time position at one 
of the 180 companies that 
recruit on campus.

This year, I noticed that 

many recruiters trumpeted 
their 
company’s 
diverse 

and 
inclusive 
workplace. 

Awards 
from 
publications 

like DiversityInc as well as 
the Human Rights Campaign 
were 
proudly 
displayed 

at 
various 
booths, 
and 

recruiters were more than 
willing to speak about the 
gender mix at their firm and 
how it compared to specific 
competitors.

Beside displaying awards 

and openly discussing their 
efforts to promote diversity, 
many 
organizations 
have 

begun to specifically recruit 
diverse 
talent. 
Through 

accelerated 
internship 

recruitment (that can start 
as early as freshman year) 
and 
mentorship 
programs, 

companies are making an 
effort to hire more women, 
more racial minorities and 
more 
LGBT 
individuals 

directly from universities.

As I passed through the 

dozens of firms advertising 
these programs, I wondered 
whether or not they were 
just for show. I thought that 
maybe they were a way to 
make 
the 
company 
more 

appealing to undergraduates. 
Trumpeting 
their 
firm’s 

diversity and inclusiveness 
would allow recruiters to rein 
in the very best talent that the 
University of Michigan has 
to offer, as everyone ideally 
wants to work in an inclusive 
and 
supportive 
workplace. 

I would later find out that 
there is actually a compelling 
business case for diversity.

In one of my courses on 

human behavior, I learned 
that 
diversity 
in 
groups 

promotes 
heightened 

organizational performance 
and 
success. 
Academics 

emphasize 
the 
enhanced 

creativity 
and 
originality 

groups are able to achieve 
with more diverse members. 

When you put people together 
with 
varying 
backgrounds 

and 
experiences, 
the 

performance 
of 
the 
team 

surpasses that of a team with 
members of relatively similar 
backgrounds. Diverse teams 
simply have more tools at their 
disposal to solve the problems 
the organization faces. Better 
performing teams yield a 

better performing company.

LeanIn.Org and McKinsey 

& Company recently stated in 
their Women in the Workplace 
2017 report that “diversity 
leads to stronger business 
results.” With this, it’s clear 
to see why companies are 
tirelessly 
recruiting 
more 

women, 
along 
with 
other 

underrepresented identities.

After 
realizing 
that 

diversity promotes a certain 
competitive 
advantage, 

organizations have started 
to set “gender targets” along 
with 
various 
“minority 

targets.” These targets call 
for 
a 
specific 
percentage 

of women or minorities to 
work at certain levels within 
the firm, whether it is at the 
entry-level or in the C-suite. 
The Women in the Workplace 
report also discussed how 
companies who use these 
targets have faced staunch 
disapproval from employees, 
largely 
white 
men, 
who 

believe 
that 
merit-based 

hiring 
and 
promotion 

practices should be the norm. 
Despite 
their 
objections, 

companies 
have 
learned 

to 
successfully 
implement 

these targets (with employee 
approval) by clearly making a 
compelling case for diversity 
to all employees.

The 
promotion 
of 

diversity and inclusion in 
organizations serves another 
purpose: 
Companies 
seek 

to ensure that new recruits, 
particularly 
women 
and 

underrepresented minorities, 
feel safe and respected in 
the workplace. In the wake 
of the most recent election 
and the onslaught of sexual 
assault 
allegations 
from 

the 
“Weinstein 
Effect,” 

students are looking to work 
in inclusive environments, 
where 
no 
single 
identity 

dominates.

After learning why more and 

more companies are recruiting 
diverse talent, it became clear 
my initial assumption— that 
recruiting 
diverse 
talent 

was 
merely 
a 
marketing 

technique—couldn’t be further 
from the truth. The accelerated 
internship 
recruitment 
and 

mentorship programs were, 
in fact, benefiting companies 
and employees alike. They 
were carefully thought out 
and strategically implemented 
to better their firms and the 
environment of the people 
they hire.

Similar to how affirmative 

action 
brings 
different 

perspectives to universities, 
diversity-based recruitment 
programs help bring different 
perspectives to organizations. 
These different perspectives 
are imperative for companies 
to compete and to remain 
relevant in the ever-changing 
marketplace. 
Promoting 

diversity and inclusivity in 
organizations isn’t just the 
right thing to do; it may also 
be the best way to foster 
success.

Students that are ineligible 

to take advantage of these 
programs may feel that they 
are unfair and borderline 
discriminatory, 
but 
I 

believe that they serve a 
distinct 
business 
purpose. 

I also believe this trend of 
recruiting diverse talent can 
teach everyone an important 
lesson. 
Companies 
are 

recruiting 
diverse 
talent 

because 
they 
are 
looking 

for 
unique 
candidates 
— 

candidates 
with 
different 

perspectives. 
Anybody, 

regardless of their gender or race, 
can differentiate themselves by 
possessing a unique set of skills and 
experiences and thus, possessing a 
different perspective.

A 

friend asked me last 
night what parts of the 
University of Michigan 

experience I felt I missed 
out on.

I said that I didn’t 

feel like there are any 
parts I’ve missed out on 
because Michigan has 
simply become my life. 
I have arrived at a place 
where I do not need 
to be doing anything 
specific to feel like I 
am doing the Michigan 
experience. 
Whatever 

events, 
lectures 
and 

concerts occurred, I was either 
there or not. And if I wasn’t, 
I was somewhere else, doing 
something different — bowling, 
eating Bruegger’s, sitting in 
my room, napping, sitting in a 
gloriously unoccupied UMMA 
because everyone else was at 
this thing that I wasn’t at which 
meant I had a lot of space to 
really get into my homework/
Netflix/chat with a longtime 
friend from home, etc. — and that 
counts just as much as anything 
else towards taking part in “The 
Michigan Experience.”

I was abroad in Paris during 

this past semester, and yet I felt 
really close to my friends from 
home and from Michigan. Why? 
Because no matter where I am, 
no matter what I am doing, the 
friends and family that mean 
something to me stay in my life, 
they stay in the spirit of my mind.

In fact, getting away from 

those friends actually increased 
my understanding of how much 
they mean to me. By not being 
with them, I got to think about 
who I think about, and who I 
don’t care about at all! By gaining 
distance from my roots and my 
normal everyday routine, I could 
identify the parts of that routine 
that are great and impactful, as 
well as those moments I spend 
my life inactively or passively, 
not deliberately defining my 
days for myself. I began to see 
that I spend a lot of time, for 
example, holed up in my room 
or in relationships that do not 
actually make me feel good. I 
spend time both closed off from 
the world and not letting new 
things in, such that nothing can 
actually change. Bad moods 
persist and exacerbate when 
I do not let in new material to 

help change my perspective and 
how I understand what’s going 
on. Coming back to Michigan, 

I can now make 
the 
necessary 

edits for myself to 
ensure my time is 
spent openly and 
collaboratively.

And that’s such 

a beautiful thing. 
That no matter 
where you are — 
in 
an 
airplane, 

stuck in traffic, 
lying 
in 
bed, 

sitting in an exam 

— you are always experiencing. 
You are always breathing, you 
are always with yourself, inside 
your mind and your body. You 
can always make the world a 
little bit more your own. Wow! 
What an existential delight that 
really can be, if we take full 
advantage.

The whole concept of “missing 

out on something” relies on 
norms and understandings of 

“what to do” that are created by 
other people, defined before I 
even showed up by the patterns 
and habits of people I never 
even met. It presupposes that 
in order to not “miss out,” you 
can do X, Y, Z, A, B, C, check, 
check, check, and then you 
come out the other side and 
you have arrived at a place of 
completion, of closure, as if you 
were in a supermarket getting 
all the necessary ingredients 
for holiday eggnog. What a 
brittle way of experiencing life 
because it doesn’t allow for 
customization, it doesn’t allow 
for your individual take on 
things to shine through. Life is 
more than a big jar of eggnog!

An example: The other day, 

my brother and I were walking 

around SoHo in Manhattan and 
we came across the Bathing Ape 
store. Bathing Ape (Bape for 
short), for fashion outsiders, is 
an overpriced company that sells 
clothes. Outside the store, there 
was a huge line, and my brother 
and I were really shocked that 
someone would wait in line for 
hours just to spend tons of money 
on a piece of clothing.

“What’d you do today, your big 

day out in the Big Apple?” “Oh, 
honey, it was terrific. I stood in 
line, in the cold and rain, and 
everyone else in line was on their 
phone just like me, idly passing 
the time until we got in the 
store. Then, finally, I got in, and 
I bought this diamond-studded 
mink jacket for a million dollars! 
And it’s Bathing Ape! Bape, 
honey!”

Why were these people in 

line? Because they’ve grown to 
believe that these clothes matter, 
that they are worth hours of their 
time and money. The significance 
of the clothes comes from its 
status as a big-time brand worn 
by big-time people. These big-
time people define meaning for 
the smaller-time people waiting 
in line.

It’s tragic that non-famous 

people endow famous people 
who are being paid by famous 
companies with a power to define 
what it means to look, feel and 
smell good because you don’t need 
to buy any particular thing to look 
good. Be comfortable, be naked, 
be yourself. Know yourself. Hide 
nothing from yourself. Define 
goodness 
and 
prettiness 
for 

yourself, get to know what turns 
you on and gets you jazzed. And 
then do it for yourself because you 
are who you are with all the time. 
In order for this to be a beautiful, 
beautiful thing, which it can so 
easily be, you have to accept that 
you can only be in one place. To 
understand that oneness of yours

I 

don’t blame my parents. 
I don’t look down upon 
them for their apathy. I 

definitely don’t consider them 
to be ignorant or anything 
less than intelligent. They 
were new to this country, to 
the language, to the quirks 
and they had a family to 
feed. I don’t blame them for 
not knowing the first thing 
about 
American 
politics. 

Consequently, I got to figure 
out who I was politically by 
myself. My party identity 
wasn’t 
handed 
down 
like 

the necklace that’s given to 
new brides generation after 
generation 
in 
my 
family. 

My political leanings were 
organic because even as an 
eight-year-old 
kid, 
I 
was 

attracted 
to 
the 
guiding 

message of one of the parties 
more than the other. Yes, 
you did, in fact, read that 
correctly — I was eight years 
old when I first got involved 
in American politics. I made 
“John Kerry for President” 
buttons at an event at my 
school.

What attracted me then 

and continues to drive my 
liberalism to this day was the 
inclusivity of that campaign’s 
rhetoric. As a kid whose first 
language 
wasn’t 
English 

and who was often picked 
on for bringing Indian food 
for lunch, all I wanted was 
to fit in. As I grew up, I felt 
that the Democratic Party 
granted that wish — I felt like 
I could belong. But, when I 
look at my party today, I can’t 
help but think if I was an 
eight-year-old in 2018, would 
I be making buttons for the 
Democratic Party?

At the most inopportune 

time, it seems my party — 
the party I’ve worked for, 
donated to, even worshipped 

to some extent — has decided 
that they want to follow a 
path that closes doors rather 
than opens them. Even a 
cursory glance at the liberal 
corners 
of 
social 
media 

shows a civil war within 
the party. When I worked 
for the Democratic National 
Convention 
Committee 
in 

the summer of 2016, one of 
the guiding themes of the 
whole experience was that 
what made it so hard to put 
on a Democratic convention, 
as opposed to a Republican 
one, was the diversity in 
the party. From unions to 
minority and ethnic groups, 
the convention was supposed 
to be a celebration of the 
inclusivity that drew this kid 
looking to belong in the first 
place. But that utopia began 
to whittle away right in front 
of my eyes as on each night 
of the convention, different 
factions of the party decided 
to voice their displeasure. I 
sensed then that my party 
was at a tipping point.

While this was going on, 

the Republican Party adopted 
one of their least inclusive 
platforms 
yet, 
promising 

walls and bans while helping 
only a select few at the top of 
the economic ladder. I went 
to high school in one of the 
most conservative townships 
in my state; in a 2008 mock 
election at my middle school, 
John McCain won 75 percent 
of the vote. I have friends 
who hold real conservative 
principles and whose families 
have 
voted 
exclusively 

Republican 
for 
generation 

upon 
generation. 
These 

people understand that the 
Republican Party is no longer 
the conservative party they 
grew up attracted to. They 
are honestly trying to find it 

within themselves to be the 
first in their families to cast 
ballots for Democrats, only to 
be told by people on Twitter 
and on their campuses that we 
don’t want their membership 
and they are not progressive 
enough to be Democrats. 

I don’t know when exactly 

it happened, but somewhere 
along the way if you wanted 
to be a real Democrat it 
wasn’t enough to want a 
public 
option 
for 
health 

insurance or to make college 
more affordable; suddenly, 
if you didn’t believe in full-
blown single payer or free 
college for everyone, your 
liberal card was taken from 
you. Furthermore, if you are 
a person of faith who believes 
that life starts at conception, 
then you can forget about 
it. We don’t want you. As a 
result, my friends, who were 
looking to belong just as I 
once did, were destined to a 
life as political nomads.

In a time when one party 

has closed its doors and 
actively 
passes 
legislation 

that either hurts the majority 
or only helps the minority, 
my party should have stood 
up. My party should have 
said enough is enough. They 
should exclaim, “it doesn’t 
matter 
whether 
you’re 

Black or white, rich or poor, 
young, old, if you’re liberal or 
conservative or somewhere in 
between, you can be a member 
of this Democratic Party!” 
It’s not too late. My party can 
still be the party I grew up 
idolizing. My party can be the 
one that’s for helping people, 
and I couldn’t care less if you 
believe in a 50 percent top tax 
rate or one at 30 percent.

I hated “Star Wars: The Last 
Jedi.” I thought it was a terrible 
movie with a poor plot, weak 
character 
development 
and 
a total lack of understanding 
of what made the previous 
films great. I’ve had a lot of 
conversations with people over 
the past few weeks about why I 
believe that is. As I’ve watched 
discussion and debate about the 
film play out online, I’ve come 
to an even more important 
realization. I’ve been a “Star 
Wars” fan all of my life, which is 
why I don’t like the newest film. 
But what I take even more of an 
issue with than the film itself is 
the discussion surrounding it.
Almost as soon as “The Last 
Jedi” was released in theaters, 
it became clear that this was a 
divisive movie, maybe the most 
divisive ever for “Star Wars.” 
The originals are generally 
loved and the prequels generally 
loathed, 
with 
“The 
Force 
Awakens” and “Rogue One” 
both falling somewhere in the 
pretty-good-or-maybe-great-
but-not-amazing range. Before 
it was released in theaters 
worldwide, “The Last Jedi” 
boasted a stellar 94 percent 
on the critical aggregate site 
Rotten Tomatoes. That number 
has since gone down to a still 
impressive 90 percent. But for 
whatever 
reason, 
audiences 
didn’t take to the film in the 
same way. The audience score 
on the same website currently 
sits at a middling 49 percent, 
the worst ever for a “Star Wars” 
picture. Across the Internet, 
debate raged about whether 
the movie was the best one 
yet in the series or a disgrace 
to George Lucas’s legacy. But 
rather than a productive debate 
about the merits of the movie’s 
themes, commentary on its 
characters or possibly what it 
was actually trying to say and 
whether or not it succeeded in 
it, much of the discussion that 
surrounds “The Last Jedi” 
resembles that of a political 
debate 
or 
a 
Twitter 
feud 
between celebrities. It’s a fight 
filled with ad hominem attacks 
rather 
than 
constructive 
criticism.
One 
of 
the 
prominent 
narratives that surrounds this 
film is that the people who 
don’t like “The Last Jedi” don’t 
like it for one of the following 
reasons: 
All 
of 
its 
main 
characters are either women 
or people of color, it doesn’t 
respect white males and makes 
all the male characters stupid 
and they can’t let go of the old 
“Star Wars” they remember 
from when they are kids. Now 
let me preface this by saying 
that by no means are these the 
only criticisms being leveled at 
the film’s detractors, but they 
are the ones making the loudest 
splash and the ones that are 
most dangerous for allowing us 
to have a meaningful discussion 
about the film itself.
One article that was making 
the rounds over this past 
weekend was titled “Why So 
Many Men Hate ‘The Last Jedi’ 
But Can’t Agree on Why.” The 
author’s argument essentially 
boils down to this: “Because 
there is no central criticism of 
this film that everyone agrees 
upon, the reason people don’t 
like it must be sexism.” She 
points to the prequel films as 
examples of films everyone 

agrees are bad for the same 
specific reasons and uses that to 
explain that if “The Last Jedi” 
were actually a bad movie, 
everyone would have the same 
criticisms of it. This line of 
reasoning is nonsense. Art is, 
by its very nature, subjective. 
The reasons I hate “The Last 
Jedi” may be the same reasons 
another person loves it. People 
who agree that something is bad 

are perfectly free to disagree 
with each other about why it’s 
bad. I loved the scene in which 
Carrie Fisher’s General Leia 
flew through space, and I hated 
the movie, but the majority of 
people I know who both liked 
and didn’t like the movie hated 
that scene. There isn’t a one 
size fits all for criticism, film or 
otherwise.
I think that it is important 
that we as liberals not (to 
quote “Revenge of the Sith”) 
become the very thing we 
want to destroy. If we attack 
anyone who criticizes a movie 
that features a woman in the 
starring role simply because the 
movie features a woman in the 
starring role, we do ourselves a 
disservice. Do I think there are 
probably some crazy people out 
there who hate “The Last Jedi” 
because it’s about a female 

Jedi, a Black stormtrooper and 
a Resistance led by women 
and people of color? Yes, of 
course, there are those people. 
But those people probably also 
hated the similarly diverse 
“The 
Force 
Awakens” 
and 
“Rogue One” and neither of 
those movies created the kind 
of division that “The Last Jedi” 
did.
My issues with “The Last 
Jedi” involve basically every 
single part of the film, but what 
I do not have any issue with 
is the casting or the nature of 
the characters. Far from it, I 
believe these characters and 
these actors have been severely 
underserved by the story they 
were given. In my estimation, 
Daisy Ridley is far and away the 
most talented actor to ever lead 
a “Star Wars” film. She’s much 

better than Mark Hamill in the 
original trilogy and she is eons 
beyond Hayden Christensen. 
She is a gifted actress who 
had a great character in the 
first movie that I believe was 
wasted in “The Last Jedi.” Rey 
basically sits on the sidelines 
for the entire third act of the 
film, in which Luke Skywalker 
and Kylo Ren take center stage. 
Her entire storyline revolves 
around needing a man to bring 
back to the fight (first Luke, 
then Kylo). I don’t believe that 
“The Last Jedi” is bad because 
it stars a woman. I believe 
that it is bad because it doesn’t 
feature 
its 
main 
character 
(who happens to be a woman) 
nearly enough. It makes Rey 
into an agent of Luke and Kylo’s 
storylines, rather than using 
them as supporting players in 
hers. 
“The Last Jedi” wants to be 
seen as the most progressive 
and 
forward-thinking 
“Star 
Wars” yet, but in the last act 
of the film, it gives up on all of 
that to fall back on everything 
it claims it wants to forget. 
The film purports to be about 
realizing your heroes were 
flawed and not looking for an 
old man to come and face down 
an entire evil army, and then 
at the end of the movie Luke 
Skywalker comes out of hiding 
to face down an entire evil army. 
Seemingly the entire point of 
Benicio Del Toro’s character 
was to show that this isn’t a 
conflict with straight lines of 
good and evil, but one filled 
with shades of grey. And yet at 
the end of the movie, we are left 
with good guys vs. bad guys, one 
side that blows up planets and 
one side that saves lives. Rey 
and Kylo Ren are supposedly 
conflicted 
characters 

grappling with the darkness 
and light inside of them, but 
at the end of the movie Rey is 
unquestionably good and Kylo 
is unquestionably evil. There is 
no moral ambiguity about the 
ending of “The Last Jedi.” Even 
the movie’s attempts to critique 
the Han Solo archetype Poe 
Dameron fell flat on its face. 
While he is chastised early on 
for having a dumb plan that 
gets a few people killed, he later 
initiates an even dumber plan 
that leads to all but 10 members 
of the Resistance getting killed 
and nobody seems to care.
You may agree or disagree 
with the last two paragraphs 
and my assessment of the 
movie. You make think I’m 
crazy and that I missed the 
genius thematic storylines that 
the film employed. You may 
think I just wanted to see “The 
Empire Strikes Back” again. 
Regardless, we should be able 
to have a conversation about 
a movie about space wizards 
who can make rocks move 
and fly through space without 
becoming mortal enemies in 
the process. Not everything 
is black and white. Not every 
movie is going to be universally 
loved or hated and not everyone 
is going to agree on why they 
love or hate it. That’s the nature 
of the beast. These things are 
complicated. Isn’t that what 
“The Last Jedi” is trying to tell 
us? I thought so. But then again, 
I hated the movie, and from 
what I understand that must 
mean I just didn’t get it. So be 
it then. 

‘The Last Jedi’ and the 
State of Film Criticism

IAN HARRIS

Dial ‘9-1-1’ and you’ll get 
star-studded mediocrity

Fox’s new drama, “9-1-1,” 
aims to share that even those 
who come to our rescue daily 
and appear to tackle any danger 
still carry their 
own 
unfixable 
burdens of life. 
The 
series 
— 
created 
by 
the 
celebrated 
duo 
from 
“American 
Horror 
Story,” 
Ryan Murphy and 
Brad Falchuk — 
follows the lives 
of 
a 
squad 
of 
first responders, 
who are still occupied with 
their own personal struggles 
back home while saving lives 
and fighting crime. Though 
the pilot episode is packed 
with unique criminal activity, 
moments of sheer humor and a 
star-studded cast, “9-1-1” falls 
flat and comes off as formulaic.
The episode opens with 911 
operator Abby Clark (Connie 
Britton, “Nashville”) leaving 
her sick, bedridden mother 
to hustle into work and start 
receiving calls for the day. 
Her character’s most pressing 
work 
dilemma 
is 
feeling 
underappreciated and out of the 
loop, as every time help arrives 
on the scene of an emergency, 
the caller hangs up and forgets 
about her dispatcher efforts 
forever. 
Britton 
embodies 
Abby as a first responder who 
chooses to distract herself 
from her personal trauma by 
investing herself in the fate 
of the panicked people on the 
line. Remarkably, Abby stays 
calm and in control, and only 

faces her emotion while on the 
job.
Then there’s the fire force, 
composed of Captain Bobby 
(Peter Krause, “Parenthood”), 
newbie Buck (Oliver Stark, 
“Into 
The 
Badlands”), 
the 
brassy 
Henrietta 
(Aisha 
Hinds, 
“Under 
the Dome”) and 
the witty Howie 
(Kenneth 
Choi, 
“The Last Man 
on Earth”), who 
together form a 
rag-tag 
family. 
There is a clear 
and 
palpable 
chemistry 
between 
the 
members of the 
fire squad, though so far, their 
characterization and storylines 
appear 
run-of-the-mill 
and 
leave much to be desired. While 
we get insight into some of their 
personal 
dramas, 
including 
an alcohol addiction and an 
affinity for meaningless sex, 
we only see the development 
of one character arc, Buck’s. 
In taking on the trope of the 
rookie who must earn his 
stripes, Buck goes from being 
fired by Captain Bobby for 
secretly taking the fire truck to 
pick up dates, to saving a little 
girl from a home invasion and 
ultimately being brought back 
on the squad. This leaves me 
wondering what more could 
come from this character, as 
his whole story was seemingly 
spoiled in a single episode.
Lastly, there’s the police, 
whose force is questionably 
composed of only one meager 
— yet extremely badass — 
member, 
Sergeant 
Athena 
Grant 
(Angela 
Bassett, 
“American Horror Story”). Her 

internal struggle may be the 
most sentimental out of all, 
as she is tasked with fighting 
crime by day and coming 
to grips with her husband’s 
coming out to their family by 
night. Her portrayal is strong 
and energetic, and it is her plot 
arc that appears to have the 
most potential for raw emotion 
and dramatic encounters.
One 
of 
“9-1-1”’s 
most 
prominent 
weaknesses 
is 
its jumbled and zig-zagging 
plot. 
We 
rarely 
see 
the 
three different fields of first 
responders interact in this 
episode, and the plot rapidly 
and unexpectedly jumps back 
and forth between emergency 
and field far too often. The pilot 
lacked major cohesion, which 
I’m hoping will be generated as 
the season progresses.
Overall, 
no 
matter 
how 
chaotic and cluttered, because 
of its uncommon plot points, 
considerable cast and edge-
of-your-seat potential, “9-1-1” 
just might be worthy of tuning 
in for another week. For what 
it’s 
worth, 
the 
emergency 
scenarios presented in the 
show were quite original as 
compared to anything that 
I’ve seen before. In the first 
episode alone we were privy 
to a premature baby flushed 
down the toilet and stuck 
in the pipes and a woman 
choked by her own collection 
of exotic snakes. This led 
to some moments of pure 
suspense and entertainment, 
but ultimately, staying aware 
that this is a network drama, 
it was wearily known that 
the first responders couldn’t 
and wouldn’t possibly leave 
an 
emergency 
unattended, 
unsettled or unsolved.

TV REVIEW

Not every movie 
is going to be 
universally loved 
or hated and not 
everyone is going 
to agree on why 
they love or hate 
it. 

Bruno Mars’s new video for 
“Finesse (Remix) (feat. Cardi 
B)” is a certified throwback. 
“Finesse” originally appeared 
sans Cardi B on Mars’s 2016 
record 24K Magic. The track 
oozes with ’90s pop staples: 
record scratches, boy-bandy 
backup vocals and a jumpy beat. 
But the music video manages to 
elevate the aesthetic to a whole 
new level.
 Directed by Bruno Mars him-
self, the remixed video is youth-
ful, lighthearted and nostalgic. It 
begins with quick cuts of Mars 
and Cardi B dressed in brightly-
colored retro outfits, goofing 
around with paint brushes 
against a white-sheet backdrop. 
As Cardi opens, rapping about 
making people “shook,” Mars 
looks like a kid, 
grinning and 
dancing goofily 
in the back-
ground.
 After Cardi’s 
verse, the 
scene switches 
to Mars and two male backup 
dancers in classic ’90s apparel 
(conveniently re-trending now 
in 2018) of layers, short-sleeved 
sweatshirts, light-wash jeans 
and white sneakers. They bop 
smoothly on the stage of what 
looks like an outdated televi-

sion set while three similarly 
fashioned female dancers swoon 
playfully from a nearby balcony. 
These ladies — as well as Cardi B 
— eventually join in 
on the feel good fun, 
dancing and DJ-ing 
as Cardi picks up 
the tempo rapping, 
“got it going on, 
don’t it feel so good 
to be us?”
 The video wraps up with 
Bruno Mars, Cardi and the 
five dancers posing silently as 
“Dedicated to: Living in Color” 
rolls onto the screen. This 
’90s-inspired video is a homage 
to the sketch comedy show “In 
Living Color,” which aired for 

five seasons on Fox beginning in 
1990. Standing alongside NBC’s 
sketch comedy program “Satur-
day Night Live,” whose cast was 
comprised of primarily white 
people, “In Living Color” had 
a majority-black cast and gave 
rise to the careers of Jamie Foxx, 
Jennifer Lopez and Jim Carrey.
 While the “Finesse” video is 
a cute throwback to an iconic 
time, the video fades to black 
and breaks its conclusive silence 
with an iconic bit of modern pop 
culture: a signature Cardi B sigh. 
Never heard one of those? Just go 
watch the video.

DAILY ENTERTAINMENT COLUMN


by all manner of ghosts, ghouls 
and 
poltergeists. 
They’ve 
wisely shifted the focus from 
the families themselves to 
Elise, a medium-for-hire with 

the ability to astral project 
into a spiritual realm called 
“The Further.” But even with 
Shaye’s 
consistently 
game 
performance, it’s impossible to 
dodge the feeling that this has 
all been done before and done 
better.
To the credit of “The Last 
Key,” it continues this trend 
of leaning into the franchise’s 
strengths by finally putting 
Elise, and Elise alone, in 
the spotlight. Instead of any 
random family calling for her 
to investigate any random 

house, it’s her own childhood 
home, the place where she 
first discovered her ability and 
learned about The Further.
It’s an admirable attempt 
to provide the character with 
an interesting backstory, and 
Shaye perfectly communicates 
that past Elise’s struggle to 
overcome the scars it left on 
her. Director Adam Robitel 
(“The 
Taking 
of 
Deborah 
Logan”) 
even 
avoids 
an 
overuse of jump scares, opting 
for a tension-based approach 
that lends itself to several 
impressive set pieces. One in 
particular purposefully uses 
tinny audio to terrific effect.
Yet for all these strengths, 
“The Last Key” still winds up 
retreading the same climactic 
points 
that 
it 
has 
moved 
through for three movies in a 
row now. Inevitably, the story 
traipses its way back into The 
Further through a combination 
of idiotic character decisions 
and convoluted storytelling 
and inevitably some demon 
with 
a 
half-way 
decent 
design reveals itself to be the 
ultimate culprit beyond all the 
happenings. Even if it wasn’t 
repetitive in the worst way, it’s 
just boring this time around, 
and the monster behind it 
all is never given any clear 
motivation of its own to make 
it a worthwhile foil of Elise. 

Even the thing’s name doesn’t 
make any sense; Javier Botet 
(“It”) is credited as Key Face, 
but the monster has keys on 
its fingers (it’s actually cooler 

than it sounds) not on its face.
The “Insidious” franchise, 
therefore, once again wastes 
its potential on a story that its 
characters, its world, its star 
and, above all, its audience 
deserve better than. “The Last 
Key” makes some definite 
improvements, and if nothing 
else, it shows that Robitel 
may have a real future in the 
genre. But for those hoping 
that “The Last Key might 
finally break the mold for the 
series will be in for yet another 
disappointment.

We can all learn some 
lessons from Córdoba

There’s no city in the world 
quite like Córdoba. Situated 
in the south of Spain, Córdoba 
has all the quaint 
charm 
of 
a 
muggy 
summer 
town. 
In 
May, 
colorful baskets 
of dainty flowers 
hang from hooks 
on whitewashed 
walls 
outside 
homes 
and 
businesses. 
It’s 
easy to get lost in 
the narrow roads 
— 
roads 
cars 
couldn’t possibly 
fit through and 
whose 
houses 
boast beautifully 
decorated patios. 
All the houses 
are white with 
bright 
yellow 
and 
baby 
blue 
fringes as if the 
whole city had a color scheme. 
Strolling through the streets 
of Córdoba in July, in a daze 
due to the intense heat, I 
could have easily surrendered 
myself to the city’s ambiance 
alone. However, I wouldn’t 
be able to truly understand 
Córdoba 
without 
knowing 
its history. Córdoba’s past is 
so turbulent that it’s hard to 
forget.
Córdoba is situated in the 
south of Spain, also called 
the 
Andalucia 
region. 
a 
part of the Roman empire, 
Andalucia was conquered by 
the nomadic Visigoths from 
northern Europe during the 
Dark Ages. The Moors soon 
took over, spreading Islam 
and building lavish mosques 
throughout the region. After 
a brief period of Jewish rule, 
the Reconquista of the 13th 
century converted Spain to 
Christianity. The Andalucia 
region was one of the last 
strongholds 
of 
the 
Moors 
before Catholicism reigned.
From 
these 
religious 
upheavals 
came 
the 
Córdoba of today: a blend 
of Christianity and Islam —
much like how Istanbul serves 
as the crossroads for the 
world’s three major religions 
(Christianity, 
Islam 
and 
Judaism). When in Córdoba 
last summer, I visited its most 
famous site: the Mezquita. 

The outside of the building 
was deceptively unappealing, 
standing only 40 feet tall and 
hidden from view until I stood 
directly in front of it. Little 
did I know that this building 
would change my perspective 
on the world forever.
Upon 
walking 
in, 
rows 
of 
towering 
red 
and 
white 
striped arches 
greeted 
me. 
They seemed to 
go on forever, 
stretching 
back as far as 
my eyes could 
reach. 
The 
columns 
were 
so 
wide 
that 
I could stand 
behind one and 
be 
completely 
hidden 
from 
view. 
I 
recognized 
these arches — 
with geometric 
patterns 
instead of religious figures 
— and the wide open spaces 
between 
them, 
as 
classic 
to Islamic architecture. To 
my right, the mihrab — a 
traditional 
Islamic 
prayer 
room 
— 
stood 
bedazzled in rich 
gold. Everything 
pointed 
to 
the 
Mezquita being a 
mosque.
Half an hour of 
exploring 
later, 
I was astonished 
to come face-to-
face with a grand 
Christian chapel. 
It was built in 
baroque 
style, 
with pearl-white 
marble columns, 
an extravagantly 
detailed 
dome 
ceiling 
and 
a 
religious 
nave. 
It 
was 
then 
that I began to 
realize how vast 
the 
Mezquita 
actually was. In 
its height of operation, the 
Mezquita had 19 doors leading 
into the complex. After an 
hour, I looked around and 
didn’t know what part of the 
building I was standing in. I 
couldn’t even find the room 
with the red and white arches 
where I’d started. Each section 
was unique from the rest, 

and each seemed to embody 
Christian 
architecture, 
Islamic 
architecture 
or 
a 
blend of both. Right beside the 
chapel was another section 
of Islamic arches, but the 
ceiling was built in the gothic 
Christian style.
I’d never been in such 
a 
strange 
place 
before. 
Everywhere I looked, my eyes 
found two types of designs: 
two 
different 
colors 
of 
columns, two different ceiling 
heights 
and 
two 
different 
types 
of 
floor 
tiles. 
The 
architectural styles conflicted 
with each other but coincided 
at the same time.
Instead 
of 
leveling 
the 
building and constructing a 
new place of worship from 
scratch, 
the 
Christians 
blended their style with the 
pre-existing Islamic mosque 
during the Reconquista. A 
large 
Christian 
nave 
was 
placed in the center of the 
building where open space had 
been before. The Christians 
built 
upwards: 
Elaborate 
ceilings were added to the tops 
of the Islamic arches. Some 
parts are distinctly Islamic, 
others distinctly Christian. 
Today, the Mezquita is 70 
percent 
mosque 
and 
30 
percent church. But somehow, 
it works.
My 
whole 
life, I’ve seen 
religions clash 
around 
me. 
My 
parents 
are 
first-
generation 
Indian 
immigrants. 
My grandfather 
fled 
Bangladesh in 
his 
twenties 
due 
to 
the 
persecution 
of Hindus by 
Muslims. I still 
hear stories of 
the continuing 
conflicts 
between India 
and 
Pakistan 
over the land 
of 
Kashmir 
between them. In the U.S., 
I’ve grown up surrounded by 
the clash between Muslims 
and Christians. Our war with 
the Islamic world is still 
raging, both physically in the 
Middle East and mentally in 
our effortless stereotyping of 
Muslims in the U.S.

‘Insidious’ can do better 

More 
than 
any 
other 
subpar horror series currently 
running, 
the 
“Insidious” 
franchise has the potential 
to become something great. 
All the pieces of the puzzle 
are there. Its world is steeped 
in an interesting mythology 
and its approach to demons, 
spirits and the afterlife is 

refreshingly novel. The de 
facto main character, Elise 
Rainier (Lin Shaye, “Ouija”), 
is a compelling and likable 
presence, to say nothing of 
how impressive it is to see a 
74-year-old woman leading a 
major horror franchise. And 
while it lacks the drop-dead 
gorgeous cinematography and 
deliberate pacing that James 
Wan — who helmed the first 
two installments — brought 
to “The Conjuring” and its 
sequel, the director’s self-

described stamp of “crowd-
pleasing but twisted” horror is 
still discernible.
All this is to say that the 
“Insidious” films have always 
been a cut above other horror 
films of similar ilk, which is 
what makes it so disappointing 
that 
they’ve 
never 
nailed 
their stories. Each of the now 
four movies in the series is a 
slight variation on the classic 
“haunted 
house” 
scenario 
where a family moves into a 
new home and is quickly beset

Finding the possibilty for religious coexistance in Spain

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

first physical manifestation 
I’d seen of what I had never 
thought possible. The world’s 
largest 
religions 
were 
supporting each other instead 
of tearing each other down. 
There would be no baroque 
ceiling without the support 
of the red and white arches 
below. The mosque provided 
the foundation, but the church 
made the Mezquita unique. 
Córdoba is comfortable with 
its roots and embraces all 
that has made it unique. 
While Spain is predominantly 
Catholic, 
Córdoba 
knows 
that its Islamic influence has 
shaped the city today.
Still, nothing is perfect. 
While 
technically 
labeled 
as 
a 
Mosque-Cathedral 
Monument Complex, Muslims 
are not allowed to pray in the 

Mezquita today. At one point, 
Visigothic 
Christians 
and 
Muslims split the building as 

a place of prayer, but modern 
religious 
wars 
have 
made 
this impossible. It makes me 
wonder: Have we, in recent 
years, 
ruined 
something 
that used to work? It was 
certainly possible for both 
groups to pray at the same site 

before. The architects of the 
Mezquita embraced the idea. 
Why is everything distinct 
and divided now?
The 
original 
intent, 
however, shouldn’t be lost on 
us. Places like Córdoba and 
the Mezquita — while not 
flawless in modern times — 
still exist. The U.S. is a melting 
pot of cultures, but religious 
tolerance has a long way to 
go. We — myself included — 
can’t walk down the streets 
without labeling people based 
on their religious beliefs or 
race. It’s inherent. But that 
doesn’t make it an excuse. 
Deep inside me lies a hope 
that, if Córdoba managed to 
house two different religions 
under 
the 
same 
building 
hundreds of years ago, we can 
do it now too.

The U.S. is a 
melting pot of 
cultures, but 
religious tolerance 
has a long way to 
go. 

The “Insidious” 
franchise, 
therefore, once 
again wastes its 
potential

Close and getting closer

EVAN AARON /Daily

Michigan coach John Beilein said after the game that he was convinced Michigan had a play set up to win the game. 

Though 
the 
Michigan 

women’s basketball team didn’t 
come 
out 
victorious 
in 
its 

overtime loss to rival Ohio State 
on Sunday, it did play a closely-
fought game full of back-and-
forth runs between the two 
teams.

Sunday’s game was a tough 

loss for the Wolverines, as they 
had multiple opportunities to 
win in the last few minutes of the 
fourth quarter, but just couldn’t 
capitalize on them.

“We had them on the ropes, it 

was a great game. They jumped 
on us early but we battled back 
and 
kept 
our 
composure,” 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said in a radio interview on 
WTKA. “Sometimes you get over 
defeats quickly, but this one is 
going to take a little bit of time.”

Time, however, is a luxury 

the Wolverines don’t have. Now, 
they need to turn around quickly 
and prepare to face Indiana on 
Wednesday.

“Today we have to move 

on, we have to be focused on 
Indiana, we have to be focused 
on our next game,” Barnes Arico 
said. “That game will be with us 
for the rest of the year and I think 
it’s going to help us improve and 
help us get better.”

Though the Hoosiers are just 

8-9, they bring young talent to 

the table for which Michigan 
must be prepared. 

“Indiana is a really good team, 

they’re led by two all-conference 
players, Tyra Buss and Amanda 
Cahill, and their other players 
are inexperienced and young,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“They 

graduated their other players but 
they’re a team that has given us 
a tough game in the past and we 
know we can’t look past anyone.” 

The Hoosiers have just two 

seniors: Cahill and Buss, a 
forward and guard, respectively. 
Buss leads the team with 349 
points on the season, averages 
20.5 points per game and was 
named to the All-Big Ten First 
Team. Cahill has 142 rebounds 
on the season, averages 8.4 
rebounds per game, and found a 
place on the All-Big Ten Second 
Team.

The remainder of Indiana’s 

team, 
while 
talented, 
lacks 

experience. 
The 
Wolverines 

hope to take advantage of that 
with their veteran players.

“We had that tough one, but 

the success of our team, our 
maturity, our experience (and) 
our upperclassmen have got 
to put the young ones on their 
shoulders and teach them the 
way,” said Barnes Arico.

And on Wednesday, Michigan 

must not only face the challenges 
the Hoosiers present, but also 
prove that it can bounce back 
after Sunday’s tough loss.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Wolverines looking to 
bounce back at home 

 Ahead of his Super Bowl 
performance, Justin Tim-
berlake announced his 
fourth solo album, Man of 
the Woods. The album art 
is Bon Iver-esque, set in the 
woods with Timberlake 
donning a flannel under a 
wool jacket. With his lead 
single “Filthy,” fans who 
speculated a return to his 
Tennessee roots were mis-
taken.
 “Filthy” isn’t country — 
it’s an attempt for Timber-
lake to dip into electro-pop 
without fully committing. 
From the same team as 
“SexyBack” and Britney 
Spears’s dark-pop masterpiece 
Blackout, the single leans 
heavily towards early 2000s 
electro-pop. However, unlike 
“SexyBack” or 
“Gimme More,” 
which both build 
into euphoric 
choruses, 
“Filthy” lacks 
momentum. By 
minute two, I 
was ready for the 
song to do something. The same 
robotic synth throbs endlessly 
over the song’s unneeded five 
minutes. When the lackluster 
chorus finally does arrive, it’s 
indistinguishable from the 
verse.
 Repetitive production can 
excel with the right lyricism 
(see Talking Heads’ “Psycho 
Killer”), but Timberlake’s song-
writing is equally disinterest-
ing. “Filthy” is a patchwork 
of one-liners that show Tim-
berlake’s disconnect with pop 
music’s pulse. With lines like 
“Haters gonna say it’s fake” and 
“This ain’t the clean version,” 
Timberlake, now 38, is showing 
his age with corny “this is how 
the kids talk” lyricism. With 
a February 2 release date, I’m 
hoping the remainder of Man of 

the Woods leaves this synth-pop 
behind and commits to Timber-
lake’s signature bubblegum pop. 

— Danny Madi-
on, Daily Arts 
Writer 

 “Filthy” stars 
out on a high 
note, with Justin 
Timberlake call-
ing out, “Hey, 

if you know what’s good!” in 
his characteristic, high-energy 
belt. And it keeps climbing from 
there, but not in the way you’d 
expect.
 For over half of its nearly 
five-minute duration, “Filthy” is 
jerky and deceptively low-ener-
gy, an understated jam with a 
funky spring. Then the electric 
guitar kicks in, and suddenly 
the song reaches the energetic 
peak it has secretly been build-
ing to all along — only to fall 
back again a few seconds later 
into its own hypnotic under-
current. The song ends amid 
a weirdly ghostly atmosphere 
that feels like the exact antith-
esis of the place where it started 
out: A woman whispers, “Do 
you see me? Can you find me? / 
Look closer, through the trees / 

Do you see it?” And then noth-
ing. Silence.
 Upon first listen, “Filthy” is 
a bit of a slow burn. It takes a 
while to decide what type of 
song it wants to be: A dancefloor 
jam? Five minutes of artsy back-
ground noise? To some extent, 
it never really decides. The 
lyrics aren’t really anything to 
turn one’s head at either — they 
ultimately boil down to a lot of 
repetitive lines like “Put your 
filthy hands all over me” and 
“Your friends, my friends and 
they ain’t leavin’ ’til six in the 
morning.”
 However, the song does suc-
ceed in blending a large number 
of genres — pop, electronica 
and funk to name a few — into 
an overall catchy song. “Filthy” 
doesn’t pretend to be anything 
it’s not; at one point, Timberlake 
even sings, “You know this ain’t 
the clean version.” It’s unpre-
tentious and genuinely fun. As 
far as what direction it’s point-
ing in, we may have to wait for 
Timberlake’s next single — or 
simply the release of his upcom-
ing album, Man of the Woods — 
to know for sure.

“We will never surrender!” 

Winston Churchill shouts in 
one of his most famous speeches 
to the House of Commons, 
recreated in one of the most 
powerful 
moments 
of 
the 

thrilling retelling of Churchill’s 
first few weeks as 
Prime 
Minister, 

“Darkest 
Hour.” 

With France on its 
heels, the United 
States 
nowhere 

to be found and 
Nazi 
Germany 

seemingly 
on 

the 
brink 
of 

domination 
over 

all 
of 
Europe, 

into 
the 
fray 

stepped Winston 
Churchill, 
who 

would eventually 
succeed 
where 

Neville Chamberlain had so 
infamously failed. Gary Oldman 
(“The Hitman’s Bodyguard”), 
rendered almost unrecognizable, 
portrays 
Churchill 
with 
a 

gravitas and force that seems 
destined to rank among his best 
performances. 
The 
stunning 

picture 
also 
features 
Ben 

Mendelsohn (“Rogue One: A 
Star Wars Story”), Lily James 
(“Baby Driver”) and Kristin Scott 
Thomas (“Sarah’s Key”). Written 
by Anthony McCarten (“The 
Theory of Everything), directed 
by Joe Wright (“Pan”) and 
accompanied by a breathtaking 
score 
composed 
by 
Dario 

Marianelli (“Anna Karenina”), 
“Darkest Hour” reminds us of 
how, in the midst of the darkest 

chapter in modern European 
history, there were still people 
brave enough to stand up for the 
light. 

Oldman’s charisma and energy 

propel 
the 
film, 
demanding 

attention every time he is on 
screen 
while 
simultaneously 

giving viewers a deep look 
into the confused, conflicted, 
depressed but never conquered 

mind of Winston 
Churchill. The film 
takes care to paint 
Churchill 
as 
a 

flawed individual, 
one whose vices 
occasionally 
got 

the better of him. 
His 
relationship 

with his wife is 
well 
established 

in the first act 
but 
does 
fall 

off a bit as the 
movie 
continues. 

Churchill’s 
complex 

relationships with the King of 
England and other members 
of Parliament is 
portrayed 
in 
a 

fairly 
unbiased 

manner, 
though 

the 
benefit 
of 

history 
will 

clearly 
lead 

the 
audience 

to 
fall 
almost 

exclusively on one 
side. 

The 
film 
is 

visually stunning. 
It features sweeping overhead 
shots of the Parliament chambers 
and limited use of stylized war 
footage that gives the film a wide 
spectrum of interesting shots. 
The overall aesthetic is cold and 

crisp, fitting for a story about the 
darkest days in British history. 

There aren’t enough good 

things that can be said about the 
soundtrack in “Darkest Hour.” 
Few films in 2017 have featured 
a booming orchestral score so 
prominently, 
harkening 
back 

to a grander, more narrative-
based method of scoring movies 
that has faded from prominence 
in today’s era of temp scores 
and generic action music. With 
his score for “Darkest Hour,” 
Marianelli has redefined himself 
as one of the most promising 
young composers in the industry. 

There are only two facets 

of the film in which it falters. 
One is the length. The second 
half of the movie at times feels 
like it’s spinning its wheels, 
with Churchill and the remains 
of 
Chamberlain’s 
powerbase 

fighting a war that feels like 
it could have been condensed. 
There also is a subplot that 
focuses on Churchill’s young 
aide eventually coming around 
to him that feels both outdated 

and out of place, 
and it seems like 
that 
storyline 

either 
could’ve 

been cut or the 
time 
would’ve 

better been spent 
elsewhere. 

“Darkest 

Hour” might be 
Oscar-bait, 
but 

it is also simply 
an 
amazing 

film. It features one of Britain’s 
finest actors as one of Britain’s 
finest men in the weeks before 
what would be one of its finest 
hours in history. Oldman gives a 
performance for the ages.

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico says her team must move on quickly.

A 

controversial review to 
give Purdue the ball, a 
somewhat controversial 

foul called on an in-bounds 
play and a half-court shot that 
missed just 
short.

Those 

were 
the 

lasting 
moments 
from 
the 

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team’s 70-69 
loss to the 
fifth-ranked 
Boilermakers. Any of which 
could have changed the outcome.

The 
review 
came 
when 

redshirt 
sophomore 
Charles 

Matthews seemingly had the 
ball poked out of his hands by 
Purdue guard Dakota Mathias. 
During the replay, Matthews 
told Beilein the ball didn’t go off 
his hands, but after an unusually 
long look at the monitors, the 
referees disagreed.

“I wish we could have got 

Charles to the rim,” Beilein said. 
“It looked like he was going to 
go lay it in, and all of the sudden, 
you know, with 5.6, or whatever 

it is on the clock, that’s enough 
time. I really was convinced that 
we had a play set up that we were 
going to win the game. All of 
the sudden, they’re winning the 
game.”

Considering how the game 

went, 
with 

Michigan 
crawling 
back 

from a 14-point 
first-half deficit 
and having the 
ball in its hands 
with the game on 
the line, it’s easy 
to 
understand 

disappointment. 
This would have 
been a huge win 
against a Boilermaker team that 
has looked as good as any in 
recent weeks.

Yet, taking a step back, it’s 

hard to ignore how far the 
Wolverines have come.

This isn’t the same team 

that lost to LSU, looked hapless 
against North Carolina and 
blew a huge lead in Columbus. 
On Tuesday, against a team 
that looked like it was a terrible 
matchup 
for 
Michigan, 
the 

Wolverines hung around.

Freshman 
forward 
Isaiah 

Livers 
and 
freshman 
guard 

Jordan Poole kept the Wolverines 
alive at times. They were hardly 
factors early in the season.

Simpson hit two huge 3-pointers 
to give Michigan its first lead of 

the game with 
4:38 left. He was 
benched 
after 

the loss to the 
Tigers.

Most 

importantly, 
perhaps, 
the 

Wolverines 
made 
halftime 

adjustments 
and came back 
against an elite 

team when they were punched 
in the face to start the game. 
Against the Tar Heels, that 
seemed an impossibility.

It was enough to give senior 

guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman encouragement.

“I was pretty encouraged, 

but you never like to see your 
team lose,” said senior guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman. “I mean, a lot of guys 
showed a lot of great stuff. We’ve 
just got to continue to grow. It’s a 
marathon.”

Michigan still has plenty 

of 
progress 
to 
make. 
The 

Wolverines still had trouble 
stopping 
Boilermaker 
center 

Isaac Haas, and if it weren’t for 
a strong, second-half shooting 
performance, Michigan might 
not have been in the game.

But the adjustments were 

made, and if Matthews’ call 
doesn’t get overturned, or if 
Wagner doesn’t foul Haas, or 
if Matthews’ half-court heave 
goes four inches further the 
Wolverines come out on top.

Steady 
improvement 
over 

the season has nearly become a 
patented trademark of Beilein’s 
teams. This one may be another 
example.

Tuesday’s 
game 
was 
just 

the latest testament to how far 
Michigan has come this season. 
It’s why Beilein seemed so 
disappointed after the game. 
Saturday’s matchup with No. 4 
Michigan State – possibly the 
best team in the country – will 
be the next opportunity to show 
it. 

The Wolverines might not get 

the lucky bounces in that game, 
either. They may lose again. Yet 
it seems they are approaching 
where they want to be. 

“I wish we 

could have got 
Charles to the 

rim.”

Like a sturdy Redwood tree, 

Isaac Haas planted his 7-foot-2, 290-
pound frame just outside the block.

With four seconds left and the 

score tied at 69, Purdue’s center 
looked to make his patented move: 
Bully himself deep into the lane, 
spin and score.

He wouldn’t get that chance, 

however.

On the backside of Haas, the eyes 

of junior center Moritz Wagner lit 
up as a sideline pass came towards 
the duo. Wagner extended his arm 
around Haas and got a piece of the 
ball.

Then a whistle blew.
“I’m not crazy about calls that 

can influence the game and can 
probably go without,” Beilein said. 
“I don’t know if that was a good call 
or not.”

And as anticlimactic as it may 

be, the matchup between two of the 
conference’s premier centers and 
teams came down to free throws.

Haas would hit the front end 

of 
a 
one-and-one, 
lifting 
the 

Boilermakers over Wagner and the 
Wolverines, 70-69.

“I was thinking I was just gonna 

make an easy hook,” Haas said. 
“When he fouled, he made it a 
harder game and I pulled it through 
for our guys.”

That matchup was a focal point 

from the opening minutes on 
Tuesday night.

On the second possession of the 

game, redshirt sophomore wing 
Charles Matthews slipped a pass 
to a cutting Wagner, who went 
up-and-under to hit a reverse layup.

Then Haas went to work, gaining 

strong position and dunking on 
Wagner.

Neither could defend the other, 

as they combined for 15 points 
before the first media timeout.

It was Haas who sustained his 

aggressiveness, though. He shot 
7-for-14 from the floor to score 
17 points and grab six rebounds. 
Wagner 
couldn’t 
keep 
pace, 

finishing with 11 points on 5-for-11 
shooting.

But Haas’s influence went far 

beyond his scoring total.

Thanks to his physical advantage, 

Haas attracted with double-teams 
in the first have with Michigan 
shifting a guard down to double 
him. And even when an extra 
defender forced Haas to pickup his 
dribble, the Boilermakers scattered 
the perimeter with snipers ready to 
fire.

Haas took advantage of that at 

the end of the first half, firing a pass 
outside to guard P.J. Thompson — 
one of 12 total triples for Purdue.

“I think just having Haas down 

there,” said Muhammed-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman.. “You have to have to 
worry about Haas so much and 
their back-up bigs. I think we just 
lost track of assignments, and they 
got easy shots.”

On the other end, Purdue 

gave Haas’s counterpart plenty 
of attention — but without the 
consequences.

Wagner scored 24 points in the 

second matchup between both teams 
last season, leading Michigan to an 
upset victory over the Boilermakers. 
Tuesday, they game-planned to stop 
Wagner, switching and going over 
the top on ball screens to limit his 
3-point opportunties.

“He destroyed us last season,” 

said Purdue coach Matt Painter. 
“We weren’t going to let him beat us 
again.”

Despite 
the 
new 
looks, 

adjustments were made which 
helped keep the Wolverines close 
despite a multitude of Purdue runs.

Struggling to finish, Haas went 

2-for-6 in the second half. 

“After halftime, we said if he gets 

the ball down there, we have to be 
strong,” Livers said. “I think once we 
did that, it became a lot better ball 
game.”

Wagner looked to be doing just 

that in the final moments.

Instead, he was called for a foul, 

losing his final battle of the night 
against Haas. 

ETHAN WOLFE
Daily Sports Editor

After taking home a bronze 

medal with the U.S. National 
Junior 
Team 
at 
the 
2018 

World Junior Championships, 
freshman forward Josh Norris, 
freshman 
defenseman 
Quinn 

Hughes and sophomore forward 
Will Lockwood rejoined their 
Michigan 
teammates 
this 

weekend.

But only two of the three were 

able to compete in Team USA’s 
final four games of the highly-
anticipated tournament, held in 
Buffalo, NY from Dec. 26 to Jan. 
5.

During a preliminary round 

game against Canada on Dec. 
29, Lockwood suffered a serious 
injury after landing on his left 
shoulder. The injury put him out 
for the rest of the tournament, 
and it is growing increasingly 
likely that he will be sidelined for 
the rest of the Wolverines’ 2018 
season, too.

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

noted 
last 
week 
Lockwood 

would be reevaluated by the 
team doctor upon returning to 
the Wolverines. After further 
inspection this week, it appears 
now surgery will be unavoidable. 
 

“He was evaluated yesterday, 

and basically told the options that 
are in front of him,” Pearson said 
after practice Tuesday. “Him and 
his family will make a decision 
with what they want to do. It’s 
basically one of two things: He’s 
either going to try to play at some 
point this year, and he’s going to 
need surgery at the end of the 
year, and or just have surgery 
now, and call it a year, and just get 
ready for next fall.”

Regardless 
of 
whether 

Lockwood will be out for a small 
increment of time versus the 
remainder of this season, the 
skilled forward’s absence is likely 
to leave a devastating impact on 
Michigan’s offense. Lockwood 
has tallied 11 points this season 
so far — the sixth-most of any 
Wolverine.

Just 
a 
year 
ago, 
during 

Lockwood’s 
elite 
freshman 

season — where he finished with 
20 points — his performance 
was hindered when an injury to 
the same shoulder took him out 
for five games. He had surgery 
in the offseason and underwent 
a taxing rehabilitation process, 
making the approaching surgery 
he will have to go through all the 
more serious. 

“It’s pretty drastic either way,” 

Pearson said. “We just want 
to make sure he gets well, and 
doesn’t have any more setbacks 
like he had this year.”

Pearson is very conscious of 

the drawbacks that will come 
with Lockwood’s vacancy, but 
also hopes his team will be able to 
step up in game situations in light 
of this unfortunate circumstance.

“(Lockwood) is an exciting 

player, he’s a fast player, he’s a 
skilled player,” Pearson said. 
“He plays the right way, so yeah, 
those players are hard to find. 
And obviously we can’t just add 

anybody, we don’t have a lot of 
depth to begin with. But having 
said that, it’s an opportunity for 
someone to step in, get some 
extra 
ice 
time 

and fill that void.”

Lavigne set as 

starter

Early 
on 
in 

Michigan’s 
season, Pearson 
expected 
a 
starting 

goaltender 
to 

emerge heading 
into 
the 
fifth 

weekend of play.

But as it became clear that 

sophomore goaltenders Hayden 
Lavigne and Jack LaFontaine 
were performing at an even level, 
the decision to select a go-to man 
was put on hold.

Now, a little over halfway 

through the Wolverines’ regular 
season, it appears that they 
have finally selected a starter. 
Following Michigan’s home-and-

home series against Notre Dame, 
Pearson stated that Lavigne’s 
performance — against the now-
No. 1 team in the nation, no less 

— has earned him 
the nod as starter 
in goal.

“I 
thought 

he’s 
established 

himself 
this 

weekend as our 
guy,” 
Pearson 

said. 
“It’s 
just 

two games, but 
we haven’t had a 
guy put back-to-
back games like 

that, and good for him. We’re 
going to need that going forward 
… I thought he was excellent, and 
that’s all we need.”

Lavigne played a crucial role 

for the Wolverines, making 59 
saves throughout the weekend’s 
two full games. The goaltender 
allowed just four pucks past him 
when facing the Fighting Irish — 
one of the conference’s offensive 

powerhouses.

Michigan 
has 
yet 
to 
see 

consistency at the position. The 
Notre Dame series marked the 
first time a Michigan netminder 
has stayed in for two complete 
games.

Pearson 
expects 
Lavigne’s 

sturdiness in the net will not only 
help to minimize the opposition’s 
scoring, but will additionally give 
his teammates an extra boost of 
confidence on the ice.

“If you’ve got a goalie back 

there that you can trust and 
know is going to make a majority 
of the saves, that can really help,” 
Pearson said. “We play a little 
bit looser I would say, you’re not 
as uptight…and I think that can 
give your team confidence, and 
that’s what we’re looking for, for 
Hayden.”

Big Ten update
While the beginning of the 

season featured a large number of 
series splits, now, just beyond the 
halfway mark of the 2018 regular 

season, a significant separation of 
skill level within the competitive 
Big Ten conference has emerged.

Not only does Notre Dame 

now command the conference, 
but it also sits atop the country, 
earning 
the 
No. 
1 
ranking 

coming off its weekend against 
Michigan. The Fighting Irish are 
the only undefeated team in the 
Big Ten and are riding a 15-game 
win streak following their sweep 
of the Wolverines. 

Notre Dame has demonstrated 

the ability to shake up a conference 
it only joined this season, with 
the strongest team defense in the 
conference — including an all-
star goaltender Cale Morris, who 
holds an impeccable 0.965 save 
percentage.

No. 6 Ohio State holds the 

second-best conference record, a 
big shock as the Big Ten Coaches 
pre-season poll predicted the 
Buckeyes would finish third-to-
last in terms of record.

Ohio State had an upset sweep 

of Minnesota in early December, 
and also swept Michigan and 
Michigan State. The Buckeyes 
have utilized their special teams 
unit effectively, with the highest 
power play percentage (19.57) in 
the conference.

No. 13 Penn State, No. 9 

Minnesota and No. 18 Wisconsin 
all hold similar records, sitting 
in the third, fourth and fifth 
spots in the Big Ten, respectively. 
The Nittany Lions have the 
most dynamic offense in the 
conference, scoring 90 goals on 
the season so far — at least 25 
more than any other team in the 
Big Ten.

Michigan 
and 
Michigan 

State, as the sixth and seventh-
ranked teams in the conference, 
currently place in the same 
spots they were forecasted in 
at the beginning of the season. 
However, the Wolverines rank 
second overall in team offense, 
thanks to ample contributions 
from 
senior 
forward 
Tony 

Calderone, as the conference 
scoring 
leader, 
and 
junior 

forward Cooper Marody, the 
leader in assists. 

“I thought he 
was excellent, 
and that’s all 

we need.”

With 28 seconds remaining 

and the score tied at 69, the ball 
fell into Charles Matthews’s lap. 
He was the go-to guy for the 
Michigan men’s basketball team’s 
final shot.

The 
redshirt 
sophomore 

sauntered to the left side of 
the court before lowering his 
shoulder 
into 
Purdue 
guard 

Dakota Mathias and bursting 
to the hoop. Matthews had a 
better angle. Mathias had better 
reflexes. The ball sailed out of 
bounds, and it was back to the 
Wolverines.

Or so they thought.
In 
what 
seemed 
like 
an 

eternity, the referees deliberated 
at the replay monitor. Then 
the call came in: Matthews 
had touched the ball last. The 
Boilermakers would get the final 
shot.

“I thought he was gonna lay 

that ball in with five seconds 
left,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “He had leverage, he had 
everything. I don’t know where 
the ball got slapped down, he said 
it did not go off him. Apparently 
it must’ve.” 

There was no climactic shot, 

though. Junior forward Moritz 
Wagner was called for a reach-
in foul on an outlet pass to Isaac 
Haas. The 7-foot-2 center sank 
the front end of the one-and-
one, and a 40-foot hail mary by 
Matthews clinked off the iron as 
No. 5 Purdue (5-0 Big Ten, 16-2 
overall) avoided the upset, 70-69.

“There was a long stretch 

… I knew it was one of those 
... monitor games. They were 
gonna take over the game,” said 
freshman forward Isaiah Livers. 
“Luckily, they got their foul at the 
end. … If the play goes the other 
way, we go out on top.”

Compared 
to 
the 

Boilermakers, 
Michigan 
(3-2, 

14-4) was outmatched in size, 
3-point shooting and most other 

statistics you can think of coming 
into Tuesday night’s contest. 
From the get-go, sniffing victory 
appeared to be a Sisyphean task 
for the Wolverines.

So in the first half when Beilein 

paced the sidelines, gesticulating 
furiously at a referee over a 
questionable 
offensive 
foul 

call, he couldn’t be blamed — 
Michigan needed every break it 
could get.

The close, late-game situation 

was difficult to picture the 
Wolverines in. After Beilein’s 
show of rage and more blows 
from 
Purdue, 
they 
faced 
a 

14-point first-half deficit. But 
Michigan was getting its breaks 
in a five-minute stretch. Fifth-
year senior forward Duncan 
Robinson 
swatted 
Carsen 

Edwards and took it the other 
way for a fastbreak layup, and 
followed with two free throws 
the next possession. Freshman 
guard Jordan Poole banked a 
trey, and hit a runner in the lane. 
Matthews 
splashed 
another 

three. The Wolverines’ defense 

looked the most fearless as it had 
all season.

“We made our run and they 

made their run and obviously 
made it a tough game,” Haas said. 
“… Our defensive strategy worked 
well, but when those guys get 
going it’s hard to stop that.”

With 2:19 remaining in the 

half, a 14-point margin became 
two. But like Sisyphus’s eternal 
punishment, 
Michigan 
once 

again was exposed to the best 
of Purdue. The Boilermakers 
responded with a 3-pointer, a 
layup and a feed to Haas for a 
39-32 halftime lead.

To begin the second half, 

the Wolverines went to their 
bread and butter — 3-pointers. 
Matthews stared down Haas 
and drilled one right in his face. 
Freshman forward and newfound 
spark plug Isaiah Livers got in the 
action with two corner threes. 
Poole hit three free throws after 
getting fouled behind the line to 
bring Purdue’s lead to only one.

After 
trading 
punches, 
a 

corner three from Matthews 

swirled around the rim, and 
the game was tied, 58-58. From 
there, sophomore point guard 
Zavier Simpson went to work 
with two consecutive threes to 
give Michigan its first lead of the 
game.

The raucous enjoyment of 

the Crisler Center crowd was 
short-lived. The Boilermakers 
were electric from 3-point land 
— 12-for-21 — to keep it close 
despite the Wolverines’ efforts. 
All Purdue needed in the end 
was Hass’s free throw to bury 
Michigan for good.

“We have way more room for 

improvement,” Livers said. “I 
think we could’ve done a lot more. 
We had a lot more chances that 
we should’ve taken advantage 
of, but basketball is basketball. 
Sometimes you’re gonna mess 
up, sometimes you’re gonna be on 
point. Just gotta grow.”

The 
Wolverines 
had 

momentum on their side in the 
dwindling minutes of the game. 
But it was a Sisyphean task after 
all.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | JANUARY 10, 2018

A Saturday

in
Cook’s Library


“S

hutting your eyes and 
acting like the problem is 
going to go away — it’s not 
going to go away. You have 

to actively oppose it. Intercept it. And that is 
how we solve problems. You cannot sit idly, 
basking in your own privilege, and hopefully 
things go away — it doesn’t work like that,” 
Omar, a University of Florida student and a 
protest organizer, told The Nation.

When 
white 
supremacist 
Richard 

Spencer arrived to speak at the University 
of Florida, more than 2,500 students 
protested and drowned out his speech. 
It was a victory against not just Spencer, 
but also against a school administration 
protesters felt was content to turn a blind 
eye to white supremacy as long as it did 
not directly attack them.

Spencer refused to relent. In November, 

he requested to rent out a venue to speak 
at the University of Michigan. When 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

and the University’s Board of Regents 
explained they would have to let Spencer 
speak because of his First Amendment 
rights, the campus erupted in anger.

There’s plenty of coverage in The Daily 

about what activists, professors and city 
residents have to say about Spencer. But 
even more than the protests themselves, 
I was interested in how those disagreeing 
with Schlissel’s decision constructed 
their argument.

Privilege is an intriguing concept. 

Here’s your textbook definition: “A group 
of unearned cultural, legal, social and 
institutional rights extended to a group 
based on their social group membership.” 
It was coined by Peggy McIntosh, a 
women studies scholar at Wellesley 
Centers for Women, in the 1980s, but 
oppressed groups have long known of 
it on an instinctive level. For instance, 
in the 1930s, W.E.B. Dubois identified a 
“psychological wage” that allowed poor 
whites to feel socially superior to poor 
blacks despite their economic parity.

The most prevalent of these is white 

privilege, or socially-bestowed benefits 
received for being white. In American 
society, whiteness implies normalness 
(one is not foreign). Whiteness suggests 
safety (a white teenager wearing a hoodie 

on the street is not as readily labeled a 
“thug” as a Black teen). Whiteness says 
solvency (one is not lazy and is employed). 
Most of all, whiteness protects one from 
the threat of white supremacy.

In the case of Spencer speaking at 

the University, the argument would be 
that the administration was blind to the 
suffering of students of color because 
of its white privilege. Spencer and his 
army of white nationalists would not 
directly 
threaten 
the 
majority-white 

white regents and administration. So the 
question becomes: Is Schlissel making a 
privileged statement? Can the University 
administration be discredited for this 
privilege? Are being aware of one’s 
privilege and allowing a white nationalist 
on campus compatible?

In order to think about the implications 

of something like privilege, however, we 
must be able to define its boundaries. 
The political lexicon of our generation, 
especially terms relating to identity, 
is nebulous even to the most informed 
scholars. Terms like “microaggression” 
have morphed into something that often 
deviates greatly from the intentions of 
the creator.

The concept of privilege, for example, 

becomes problematic when it is twisted to 
silence opposition. Telling someone they 
have no right to speak because of their 
privileged background is unconstructive, 
and ascribing a uniform label of privilege 
across a single group discounts the 
challenges and experiences of individuals. 
One may be born with privilege, but may 
have also been born in a low-income 
household, or with a single parent or dealt 
with any number of obstacles that most 
of their peers were fortunate not to face. 
And then there are the people who claim 
“white privilege” doesn’t exist. That is 
certainly a position I acknowledge — if 
you were white but born with scarce 
opportunities and worked harder than 
your well-off peers to reach your position 
in life, I can see how the whole concept of 
privilege can sound like a sick joke.

However, humans can often be blind 

to the benefits they receive in life. 
Psychologists Tom Gilovich of Cornell 

University and Shai Davidai of The New 
School for Social Research explain this 
as humanity’s fundamental propensity 
to exaggerate difficulties in life and 
undervalue the help we receive. They liken 
life to cycling or running, in which we 
wish for relief when there’s a headwind 
(burden), yet quickly forget about it once 
we actually receive the tailwind (privilege).

It does not necessarily make someone 

a bad person if they are privileged in 
one form or another, but cautions us to 
watch our words and open our eyes to the 
experiences of others.

I can think back to my experience as an 

Asian man in the U.S. “How does everyone 
in Japan feel about this issue?” (I cannot 
speak for all Japanese.) Or “Where do 
you really come from?” (OK, I actually 
was born in Japan, but I’ve lived in New 
Jersey for most of my life.) The ones who 
have privilege are the ones who are asking 
me these questions, the ones who never 
have to feel like an eternal foreigner in the 
country they lived in since they were three 
years old.

Yet I also must remember my status as 

an out-of-state college student (class and 
educational privilege) who can move his 
four limbs (able-bodied privilege) and is 
attracted to women (sexual orientation 
privilege). Most people don’t take an issue 
with Buddhism, my religious affiliation 
(religious privilege) and recognize me as 
male (gender privilege).

During discussions of race and ethnicity, 

my peers tend to take my concerns more 
seriously because I am a minority. When 
I’m walking out late at home in New 
Jersey, I don’t necessarily receive the same 
attention from the police as a dark-skinned 
or even white friend because I’m an Asian 
man. It doesn’t mean on a whole, I (or any 
other person of color) inherently have it 
better, but in certain situations, my race 
does work to my advantage.

Taking each of these attributes into 

account allows me to be more aware 
during discussions and perhaps reach a 
compromise, instead of sticking to my own 
narrow perceptions. That is an exercise 
we all should take part in to protect and 
nurture our diverse democracy.

Let’s Bitch About It: Not all dogs are cute

This column does not reflect the views 

of The Michigan Daily and received strong 
objections from multiple editors who were 
probably offended on behalf of their dogs. 
I

f there is one thing I stand by 
in this world, it is this: Not all 
dogs are cute.

Don’t get me wrong, I love 

dogs. I have a dog and she is absolutely 
adorable, but that doesn’t mean your 
dog is cute. Many people may take 
offense to this take — how could I 
insult man’s best friend, a creature we 
hold so dear? But with this opinion I 
must be unapologetic, because there 
is a clear hierarchy in the cuteness of 
dogs, and if you disagree, you are not 
only wrong also but lying to yourself.

Admittedly, I often lie to people and 

give out inauthentic “awws” at not-that-
cute dogs, partly out of politeness, but 
mostly to avoid an incredibly awkward 
argument. I even lie to my friends who 
are aware of my specific dog opinions. 
It is easier to tell them their dog is top-
tier and gush over photos than it is to 
consistently offend them.

You may find my dog ranking system 

to be the worst opinion you have ever 
heard. You may be personally offended 
on behalf of your dog, but on some 
level, you probably know that I am 
right. I am here to speak the truth in 
this column.

Regarding the system itself, it 

is impossible to numerically rank 
every single dog breed, especially 
when considering the variety of dogs 
and mixed-breed dogs. Instead, my 
system focuses on a three-tier ranking 

stratified into top-tier, middle-tier 
and bottom-tier dogs. Some dogs 
land in between tiers (for example, I 
often tell my friends that their dogs 
are upper-middle-tier to make them 
happy, even if I think their dog is 
somewhat ugly).

Bottom-Tier Dogs

My mental image of the typical 

bottom-tier 
dog 
comes 
from 
one 

specific dog: My grandmother’s. This 
dog is some sort of ambiguous mix of a 
Maltese, Bolognese or Bichon, but the 
overall idea is that it is small, white and 
ugly. This particular dog is overweight 
and incredibly lazy. It wobbles around 
my 
grandparents’ 
house 
seeking 

attention, but I never really want to 
pet it because its tarnished white fur 
always looks unkempt and dirty.

This model can be applied more 

broadly to encapsulate bottom-tier 
dogs. Small white dogs tend to be at the 
absolute bottom of the list. They are 
ugly-looking and often have unfriendly 
and lazy personalities, which further 
minimize their cuteness.

From this framework, other bottom-

tier dogs can be determined. Size and 
personality are weighted heavily in 
this classification. For instance, most 
terriers, Chihuahuas and Pomeranians 
are all clear bottom-tier occupants. 
The individual personality of a dog 
may improve its standing, but overall 
these types of dogs don’t have much 
to work with. Their size makes them 
more difficult to cuddle and play with. 
You could never go hiking or on any 
sort of adventure with this type of dog. 

And if your dog is inactive, why not just 
get a cat?

Middle-Tier Dogs

The middle-tier is the largest and 

least-defined sector of this ranking 
system. It is easy to throw any dog which 
you don’t want to directly call ugly 
but is not quite top-tier material into 
this middle-tier. Because of this, most 
mixed-breed dogs fall here (though 
some may still be bottom or top-tier).

Common middle-tier dogs include 

beagles, Labradoodles, anything with 
cocker spaniel influence and most mid-
size to large shorthaired dogs. Mid-
tier dogs typically tend to be larger, 
more active and have a wider range 
of personalities. There is also more 
hierarchy within the middle-tier itself. 
For instance, a pug would be at the 
bottom of the middle-tier, a corgi is the 
most average dog in existence (Reggie) 
and a labradoodle would be near the top 
of the middle-tier.

Whereas 
many 
bottom-tier 
dog 

owners will admit their dog is not the 
best, most people with middle-tier 
dogs will personally believe their dog is 
among the cutest in the world. These are 
the people who most need appeasement 
about the cuteness of their dog, and 
will constantly show photos to people. 
Owners of top-tier dogs can simply 
acknowledge a certain level of cuteness 
of the middle-tier dog while holding 
onto the knowledge of the superiority 
of their own dog.

Top-Tier Dogs

The highest tier of dogs is an exclusive 

ring tending towards those breeds 
with active and smart personalities, 

larger dogs with longer hair and more 
pointed faces. Classic top-tier dogs 
include: golden retrievers, German 
shepherds, 
huskies, 
border 
collies 

(and other sheepdogs) and Bernese 
mountain dogs.

As an owner of a top-tier dog, I can 

speak from experience. To know if 
you have a top-tier dog ask yourself 
this: Do you often see your dog breed 
featured in movies or commercials? 
Do people genuinely fawn over your 
dog pictures, or are they feigning out 
of politeness? Is your dog genuinely 
intelligent? (For instance, mine knows 
a series of complicated tricks and has 
an understanding of the world and my 
family life.) Does your dog have a good 
personality, or is it lazy or rude?

If you answered yes to most of these 

questions, you still may not have a top-
tier dog. The top tier is reserved for truly 
remarkable dogs, and most people are 
not good at subjectively assessing their 
dog’s quality. If you really want to know 
where your dog falls in the ranking, 
follow me on Twitter (@lydiamurray97) 
and send me photos of your dog and I 
will provide the unfiltered truth.

We have arrived at a culture with 

groups like Dogspotting, where we are 
expected to react to every dog like it 
is a gift to the world. Society expects 
us to hold all dogs in some high regard 
without any real critical thinking about 
the individual quality of each dog. 
We act as if all dogs are beautiful and 
perfect when in reality many dogs are 
fairly average or simply bad. I say we 
must reject that model and accept the 
world as it is: Not all dogs are cute.

A Saturday in Cook’s library

A brief history of the Law Library

by Matt Gallatin, Daily Arts Writer 
O

n a Saturday I sit in the Law 
library. I often do this, busy 
or not, wasting my time pre-
tending I’m using my time 

wisely. If I’m sitting in the library, I’m 
working, right? Of course, when I say 
“work,” I’m saying that I’m simply sitting, 
and by sitting in the library, I’m sitting 
productively. The Law library does that. 
It makes me feel like these hours spent 
curating a Facebook feed I never even use 
are somehow hours well spent, hours mov-
ing me in a forward direction, hours put 
into learning. I can call anything learning 
next these dimly lit bookshelves, amid the 
rows of old editions of the Texas Reports 
on Law with dates that feel strangely dis-
tant and somehow very present.

The era when the Law library was built 

feels the same. This stretch between the 
1920s and ’30s was the lifespan of prohi-
bition, the playground era for flappers 
and followers of the green light — cultur-
al phenomena that students at the Uni-
versity might have been forced to endure 
in a high school literature class.

“So we beat on, boats against the cur-

rent, borne back ceaselessly into the past,” 
Fitzgerald writes, and a roar of amen rises 
from North Campus as they throw their 
copies of “The Great Gatsby” into a well-
funded new recycling machine.

To the students today who do sit with-

in the Law Library, that era of prohibi-
tion likely feels ridiculous. The failed 

campaign, an attempt at masquerading 
public sobriety as public morality, feels 
especially removed when considering 
modern lives and modern laptops. Many 
sitting around me might have rolled out 
of Meijer with several blue 24-packs just 
earlier today. Most will endure no jail 
time for it.

But the Law Library, built in such 

a seemingly archaic time, is hardly a 
regressive stalwart against technological 
progress. Despite its buttressed ceilings, 
wooden walls and stained glass, the Eng-
lish Gothic architecture has not managed 
to keep modernity at bay. Gradient, cool 
mountains behind the white “Patagonia” 
label sticker Mac computers and pear-
shaped Swell water bottles. Other stu-
dents have stickers that advertise coffee, 
or the Wolverine Support Network, or 
have a cute design inspired by the 2009 
Pixar animation film “Up.”

The donor of this library was William 

W. Cook. Cook came from a time at the 
University when suits were the uniform 
and sleevelessness a sin; when women 
were barred from the Michigan Union 
without a man by their side, and when 
North Campus did not exist.

So Cook would probably gawk at the 

attire of the students sitting within his 
Law Library. Across the table from me, 
a boy wears a white t-shirt that reads 
“Saturdays / New York City.” I think it’s a 
brand but I don’t know it. His hair looks 

vaguely like a ’80s movie star’s; brown, 
pushed back, but not aggressively.

Or the girl, sitting a few seats down 

from myself, scrolling for lingerie on 
LoversLane.com.

*****
No comprehensive account exists of the 

construction of the University of Michi-
gan Legal Research Library, more collo-
quially known as the Law Library. Rarely 
in the early 20th century did builders keep 
detailed notes of the day-to-day process, 
unless significant design changes were 
made on the ground; even then, those 
changes are more likely documented in 
letters — say, between builder and archi-
tect, or architect and patron. 

This absence comes as a bit odd, even 

striking, when thinking about the ubiquity 
of the building. The Law Library is one of 
the first that comes to mind when describ-
ing the University’s campus, a glimmering 
piece of a classic, collegiate architecture 
on a campus with an often incongruous 
style. The Law Library stands apart from 
the Victorian storefronts downtown, the 
mixed style of the Michigan Union and 
the harsh brutalism of the Hatcher Gradu-
ate Library’s south stacks.

The prominence the library would play 

on campus was not unknown when it was 
built. In October of 1930, The Michigan 
Daily raved about the building, seeing it 
as a great moment for the University:

“The crying need for formulation, state-

ment and improvement of all branches of 
the law into a form intelligible, not only to 
law students and lawyers, but to the lay-
man as well, is at present being nowhere 
more adequately met than at this Univer-
sity, where, with the completion in a very 
few months of the Legal Research build-
ing, the latest addition to the Lawyers’ 
Club quadrangle, unprecedented facilities 
fors (sic) legal study will be available.”

For the writer, the facilities for the 

study of law and the actual study of law 
go hand-in-hand. One cannot occur with-
out the other; it’s as if this gothic building, 
designed in a tradition that is especially 
collegiate, is meant to impart a studious 
excellence. You might think the effect 
goes the other way; that students, not the 
buildings, should bring the atmosphere of 
scholarship to the University.

But great collegiate architecture, espe-

cially the older, more gothic inspired build-
ings, can sometimes affect a desire for 
study in itself. The chandeliers, the long 
tables, the wooden bookshelves — these 
all have a way of tuning a student into the 

academic register. The building’s donor, 
William W. Cook, held this sense, that the 
facilities are necessary for good study.

Cook, born in Hillsdale, Mich., in 1858, 

donated the Law Library and most of 
the Law Quadrangle. After earning his 
undergraduate and legal degrees in 1880 
and 1882 respectively, he went on to prac-
tice corporate law in New York City, on 
which he eventually wrote a widely cir-
culated book, “Cook on Corporations.”

The book became a seminal work for 

corporate law, widely cited and reissued 
several times. Cook’s writings would 
help shape American corporate law just 
as it was becoming increasingly relevant, 
with the second industrial revolution 
ushering in the first large national com-
panies. One of Cook’s other writings, 
“Trusts,” would help lay the foundation 
for Ohio’s famous anti-monopoly case to 
break up John D. Rockefeller’s corpora-
tion, Standard Oil Company.

He became one of the most prominent 

donors to the University, eventually giv-
ing a total of nearly $16 million (worth 
over $200 million in today’s money), 
which he says was in part to memorial-
ize his father and in part a reflection of 
his strong desire to make the University 
one of the foremost leaders in legal study. 
He operated at first under a condition of 
strict anonymity with his donation, and 
he navigated publicity carefully. He once 
stated he wanted no buildings named 
after him, but after his death, the Law 
Quad and its buildings were renamed, 
and they all now bear his name.

Cook’s hand was heavy in the construc-

tion of the buildings, having requested 
plans for the library as early as 1924, with-
out prior consultation with the law faculty. 
He contracted the New York-based archi-
tectural firm York & Sawyer, whose work 
he was familiar with, as the firm designed 
Cook’s own brownstone apartment in the 
Upper West Side of New York City.

As construction of the Law Quad com-

menced, Cook showed an increasing con-
cern with the specifics of design. Though 
Cook had some prior stipulations, it was 
during the planning of the Law Library 
when animosity and willfulness began to 
show their colors.

“I know nothing about architecture 

but have had more experience in legal 
research than any of them,” Cook wrote 
in one letter, and he indeed imposed this 
will, requesting specific alterations in 
the location of bookcases, carrels, tables 
and so forth.

Though he concerned himself with 

the aesthetics, he above all believed in 
fostering the best possible place for “the 
scientific study of law, in all its aspects 
— social, political and economic,” at the 
University. His donations more than any-
thing aimed to accomplish this. The fac-
ulty, though, grew irate with Cook during 
the construction of the Law Library.

“Cook’s manner is arrogant and he is, 

of course, wholly ignorant of local con-
ditions,” Henry Bates wrote, the dean of 
the Law School at the time.

Cook was also growing unhappy, and 

the Law Library became the battle-
ground between Cook and the Universi-
ty. Cook increasingly saw the University 
— besides a few select individuals — as 
inept, and began to take an even stronger 
role in working with the architects on 
study carrel arrangement, brick choice, 
bookshelf placement and so forth. At one 
point, Cook wrote of “serious differences 
between Bates and (President Clarence 
Cook) Little and myself as to the pro-
posed new library building,” to the point 
where he threatened to remove funding. 
Soon after, he wrote to York, one of the 
architects: “I don’t believe I shall ever 
like the present design. It looks for all the 
world like a cathedral.” The building was 
completed in 1933.

*****
The student with that confounding “Sat-

urdays / New York City” t-shirt, studying 
in the William W. Cook Law Library, has 
gotten up. Behind he leaves a Starbucks 
cup and a laptop. The Starbucks cup is the 
festive all red one, which recalls Christmas 
and, if you will it, Satan. He returns about 
10 minutes later and charges his laptop.

I go down the stairs of the Law Library 

into the basement, where Saturdays T-shirt 
just returned. Next to the green-carpeted 
extension, which was completed in 1981, 
are the men’s and women’s restrooms and 
vending machines. The men’s bathroom in 

the basement of the Law Library is a dark 
and sickly gray color, particularly fitting 
for an austere Gothic design.

On my campus tour, my guide enthu-

siastically compared the Law Quad to 
Hogwarts, Harry Potter’s Gothic, magi-
cal school of wizardry. The comparison 
seemed a bit cheesy, sort of forced at the 
time. The buildings are nice but I can’t 
fly on a broomstick or conjure frogs out of 
spiders, despite how much I’ve tried. But 
the comparison works in this bathroom. 
The cracked tiles and well worn urinals, 
as grimy as they are, give the place a sense 
of magic—because they’re real. Not that 
I think magic is real. But Hogwarts and 
Harry Potter wasn’t just some prim and 
proper Disney ride, omitting the grit of 
the wizarding world. There were ups and 
downs. There were murders. And I can see 
“Moaning Myrtle,” that poor girl killed by 
an enormous, bloodthirsty snake in book 
two, sitting in the last stall on the right in 
the men’s restroom.

I walk in that stall and don’t find Myr-

tle. Rather, a phrase sticks out, scribbled 
on the left divider: “This is the best place 
on campus to shit.” They — whoever they 
are — might be right, and this was like-
ly meant to be fraternal, but instead, it 
has an oddly violating, sort of voyeuris-
tic sense to it, and Harry Potter and his 
broomstick-flying friends disappear, leav-
ing one-ply toilet paper in their place.

*****
William Cook died in 1930 at the age of 

72, before his library and the Law Quad 
were completed. He never, so much as 
we know, paid a visit to see the buildings 
as they were constructed. The Michigan 
Daily wrote of a rumor that he feared actu-
ally observing the buildings might result 
in disillusionment with the grand project 
he set out to create. He did, though, ask 
for monthly statistics and reports on the 
usages of the facilities. He did the same 
for the all-female Martha Cook Residence 

Hall, which he also donated and had 
named for his mother. The same architec-
tural firm Cook hired for the Law Quad, 
York & Sawyer, designed Martha Cook. 

Cook’s reputation with the University 

is complicated — not nearly as simplistic 
as the benevolent donor narrative that $16 
million is bound to make for you. Cook had 
large strings attached to some of his dona-
tions, even outlining the specific terms for 
eligibility into the Lawyer’s Club, which 
was built just before the Law Library. 
Arguments over those conditions are at 
least part of the reason President Clarence 
Cook Little — who is known today for his 
eugenicist views — was forced to resign in 
1929, pushed by the regents because they 
felt he lacked diplomacy in the matter.

Cook’s legacy remains nonetheless vital 

to the University. Today, the Law Quad, 
and the Law Library especially, represent 
the utmost in architectural beauty at the 
University. Cook’s donations also helped, 
as he hoped they would, to solidify the 
University as a place for legal excellence, 
which it has remained since the erection 
of these facilities.

*****
I’m thinking about legal excellence, 

looking at the table across Saturdays 
T-shirt, as a boy puts his forehead flat 
down on the wooden table. The patterns 
in the wood on which he lies are mesmer-
izing, and if stared at long enough, induce 
a kind of psychedelic experience. Near the 
boy’s resting head sits a sign that reads, 
“Food Forbidden — Noncompliance will 
result in removal from the premises.”

Next to the boy with his head down 

on the table, a girl in a Delta Delta Delta 
sweater reads a psychology textbook, open 
to a page about the brain, looking at a sec-
tion about the amygdala, a little almond 
shaped nucleus in the temporal lobe. Two 
girls whisper to each other at the table 
next to her, and she glares at them, then 
grabs a handful of nuts from her trail mix.

I leave the Law Library, walking out the 

heavy doors and into the bitter cold, head 
numb from dull democratic theory. There 
comes a point after exiting the library 
when the synapses stop firing, when you 
disconnect entirely from the collective 
groupthink, the brain that sits beneath the 
floor corked for added silence, and sud-
denly that paper on de Tocqueville seems 
absurd as your friend regales you of the 
endowment of their most recent fling.

Of everything Cook concerned himself 

about regarding the exterior of the Law 
Library, it was the minarets, as he called 
them, on the four corners of the building 
that occupied him most. He was adamant 
about these, and he got his wish.

“At any rate kindly raise the corners 20 

or 30 or 40 feet and let us see how the whole 
building will look,” he wrote to York and 
so they did. It’s unclear why these corners 
were of such specific interest to Cook, who 
seemed far more concerned with function 
and practicality than aesthetics.

But these pillars stand tall now, defining 

features of the Law Library. For those who 
live on South Campus, walking home from 
Ashley’s will pass these unmistakable pil-
lars. I’ve made this walk many times and 
never fail to look left on State Street with a 
prideful sense of awe at the spires leaping 
into the sky. Those minarets give setting 
to the flocks of crows which often occupy a 
few nearby trees, and in the evening it’s not 
uncommon for a few of those black birds to 
swirl and shriek around the pillars.

On this particular evening, the sky is 

strangely red, sort of frightening, like a 
scene from an old horror film about were-
wolves and vampires, shot in grainy blacks 
and grays. Looking at those pillars, I thank 
Cook for the extra 20 or 30 or 40 feet. 
Inside, a girl with the phrase “The Lodge” 
on her red T-shirt sits in the seat where 
Saturdays T-shirt sat before. She locks eyes 
with the Tri-Delt eating almonds from her 
trail mix and takes a deep breath.

Let’s Talk About It: 
 
 
 
 
Writing through my obsessions

I 

was recently tapping away 
at my keyboard keys writing 
an article I was not feeling 
passionate about. This was 

deeper than a few bad weeks of writing. 
I recently felt the same way about 
my poetry, but learned to build my 
confidence in writing poems through a 
workshop class last fall semester.

Every week I would write — even 

on days I did not feel I could keep 
writing — and when I did, I discovered 
something new about the way I think. 

On the first day of my poetry workshop, 
I walked in and told my professor I 
was worried about becoming known 
as the “Muslim poet” in class because 
I write frequently about religion. 
What she replied with stuck with me. 
She explained that it is your obsession 
that chooses you, and you must write 
through your obsessions even if it 
feels like you are writing the same 
poem twice. From then on, I saw the 
poems we read in a much different 
light, 
watching 
my 
peers 
write 

through their obsessions while I tried 
to write through mine.

I find myself often falling into the 

trap of focusing on being productive 
to perfection, forgetting that some of 
the greatest thinkers in history began 
by working on improving themselves 
before sharing their ideas with the 
world. And so, as I wrote through 
my poems, they revealed to me why 
I had started writing and why I had 
stopped. I started writing poetry as 
a means of telling stories to counter 
common stereotypical narratives that 
frustrated me. I wrote as soon as I saw 
a news headline I did not agree with 

or when I wanted to put the ideas 
behind my own choices into words 
that would resonate with other people. 
This connection was invigorating for 
me and gave me a confidence I never 
had before.

I stopped writing poetry when I 

started feeling like I was repeating 
myself, but I learned to stop fearing 
how my words would be perceived 
before they even reached the page. I 
started to treat writing as a process of 
discovery instead of right or wrong.

And yet, so often when people 

do an act that is a process instead 
of 
something 
polished, 
we 
stop 

ourselves from doing the very things 
that keep us going. We put pressure 
on ourselves to be perfect, to create 
an image to uphold over social media 
or for our friends, or even people 
we have never met. We do not allow 
ourselves to fail and focus on the end 
result of everything that we do. We 
focus on becoming a “brand” instead 
of just a person trying to figure out 

what they want to do in this life that’s 
ever-changing.

I realized the problems I was 

having in my writing were the same 
ones I was having elsewhere in 
my life. Instead of focusing on the 
present, on what I wanted to write 
in this moment, I started to focus on 
myself as a writer 10 or 50 steps from 
now. To be mindful and present is an 
accomplishment in and of itself, and 
one that is too often overlooked.

And so, as I wrote through my 
poems, they revealed to me why 
I had started writing and why I 
had stopped.


A

bout 200 miles south of Ann 
Arbor, off exit 50 on I-275, 
and after a series of left 
and right turns, sits an old 

Tudor-style house. Safely positioned at 
the end of a cul-de-sac, painted a soft 
brown with maroon shutters, it now sits 
empty, with only the remnants of what 
used to be a bustling home of a family of 
five — my family of five.

I 
grew 
up 
in 
a 
suburb 
of 

Cincinnati, Ohio and experienced the 
quintessential 
suburban 
childhood. 

I attended a local public school, 
played endless games of capture the 
flag and wiffle ball in our tight-knit 
neighborhood, spent early mornings 
at Weller Park at soccer tournaments 
with the local community team, went 
to school dances, learned to drive and 
for the most part, had a childhood 
that was both normal and a privilege. 
I was consistently supported by my 
parents, Indian immigrants who had 
no idea what a quintessential American 
childhood entailed yet were somehow 
able to provide it for my brothers and 
me. Cincinnati is the place where my 
family of five spent the most time 
together, living under one roof, all 
together, something I eventually took 
for granted.

Halfway through my senior year, 

after my older brothers graduated and 
fled the nest to their respective colleges 
and jobs, my parents decided to leave: 
to leave the place we lived for 18 years. 
To leave the creaky house at the end of 
Ironwood Court, where memories were 
embedded into every crevice of a house; 
where I decided I was an undiscovered 
artist and drew flowers in sharpie on 
the wall of our yellow kitchen, the 
gaping door handle sized hole in my 
parents room created after I slammed 
the door so hard after one argument 
or another, the chewed out corners of 
our family room coffee table which 
our yellow lab Cooper designated as 
his preferred toy, our tri-level maroon 
deck where each of the Roy-Chaudhury 
kids had their graduation parties and 
my grandparents would sit and read for 
hours on end.

They decided to leave the creaky 

house, which for 17 years prevented 
any sneaking out in the middle of the 
night and always ensured that when 
one person woke up in the morning, 
everyone did. They left the dented 
mailbox at the foot of the driveway, 
which for more than 10 years doubled as 
a soccer goal post. 

They decided to leave a house that 

saw parties of all shapes and sizes. 
Birthdays, anniversaries, holidays and 
the usual “Indian dinner party” were all 

held in the creaky house on Ironwood 
Court. They decided to leave a house 
that saw moments of absolute and pure 
happiness, infectious laughter and the 
gatherings of friends and family, who 
provided the needed insulation to our 
life in Cincinnati. They left a house 
that at the same time saw moments of 
intense anger and sadness.

During the summer after my senior 

year of high school, my parents moved 
to Tucson, Arizona for my dad’s job. 
For the majority of my last semester in 
high school, I remember feeling almost 
nothing. No sense of sadness or loss 
in anticipation of my parents pending 
embarkment west. I was too caught up 
in the excitement of senior year and 
my own upcoming move to Ann Arbor. 
I naively believed their move would 
have no influence on me, because I was 
leaving too, and more, I assumed I was 
ready to leave. 

Come August, while my parents 

went back and forth from Cincinnati 
to Tucson, moving some of our stuff 
and leaving others, the time finally 
came to pack up my own room. I said 
my goodbyes to friends, who like most 
people in Cincinnati, were more family 
than anything else. I spent the first 18 
years of my life in one place, molded 
and shaped by those who surrounded 
me. My friends and family from 
Cincinnati had front row seats to my 
life; they were my biggest supporters 
and my most important critics.

We packed our car to the brim, 

with just enough room for me in the 
backseat, surrounded by everything I 
assumed I needed, not realizing just 
how much I was leaving behind.

I think we all understand how 

hard college can be, especially as a 
freshman. It’s the feeling of jumping 
off the high dive at the pool; exciting, 
nerve-wracking and the sense that 
you’ll never know if you keep your 
body straight enough to avoid a 
painful impact. My first months at 
school began with that same nervous 
excitement and unfolded into a skewed 
and twisted jump off the high dive.

Once I got to school, all I wanted to 

do was leave; to go back to the house on 
Ironwood Court, to the blue and yellow 
kitchen and the green couches. I wanted 
to walk in through the squeaky garage 
door and hear my brother watching TV, 
smell my mom’s chicken curry and the 
mumble of my dad on a conference call 
upstairs. I wanted us all to be back in the 
places we had been for almost 17 years. 
I wanted things and people to be where 
they were supposed to be, how they were.

The discomfort of being a freshman, 

thrown into an environment where I 

knew no one and relationships were 
made quickly and then ended just as 
fast, had me dreaming of Cincinnati. 
Although 
freshmen 
typically 
feel 

this sense of homesickness, mine 
was multiplied and rooted in a deep 
resistance to change. Ann Arbor was 
still unknown. Thoughtful and real 
relationships in my new home had not 
been formed yet, and Cincinnati was 
no longer home base for my family. 
Tucson, a small city nestled between 
the Catalina Mountains, was foreign to 
me, and for a while, every second spent 
there was a reminder of how much my 
life had changed.

In an attempt to feel some sort of 

grounding and stability to endure the 
awkward, lonely and also exciting 
moments 
of 
college, 
I 
clung 
to 

Cincinnati. I held on so tightly to 
something I felt was going to slip away. 
Every break initiated a fight between 
my parents on how many days would 
be allocated where, every relationship 
formed had me comparing it to the 
lifelong friends I had in Cincinnati, and 
the answer to “Where are you from?” 
was met with a rehearsed answer, 
when internally, I had no idea.

Yet, I soon realized I was holding 

myself back. As my grip around 
Cincinnati tightened, my ability to be 
present in Ann Arbor was lacking, if 
not nonexistent. Now, in the second 
semester of my junior year, I look back 
at that first semester and, like most of 
us, see a completely different person. 
The creaky house in Cincinnati wasn’t 
a home because of all the physical 
things — the countertops, the couches, 
the dented mailbox — it was a home 

because the four most important 
people in my life lived there. The 
friends who are now, and forever will 
be, family were only minutes away. The 
memories I so attributed to tangible 
things existed because of the people 
who created them. Holding on to 
Cincinnati prevented me from making 
those same memories in Ann Arbor 
and creating the relationships I was 
so lucky to have where I grew up and 
now, am fortunate enough to have 
again in college. The idea of home 
was once singular for me. It was that 
brown and maroon house at the end 
of a cul-de-sac. The yellow and blue 
kitchen, the sharpie adorned walls 
and dented mailbox.

Now, I am lucky enough to have 

three homes: Ann Arbor, Cincinnati 
and Tucson. And, all three of these 
places are virtually opposite in every 
aspect except one; each is home to 
people I love. And, in the end, isn’t that 
what a home actually is? Not where the 
laughs or fights took place, but who 
they were with. Not the yellow walls or 
the dining table, but the conversations 
and memories that formed around and 
within them.

As a junior, I realize that in a year 

or so I’ll be going through the same 
process, leaving a place which is 
embedded with memories, tangible 
landmarks of some of the most exciting 
and hard times in my life thus far. Yet, 
just as my home in Cincinnati was a 
home because of my family and friends, 
Ann Arbor is the same. After all, if I 
have learned anything over the past 
three years, it’s the people that matter 
most, not the place.

Anatomy of a home

8B

Last week I visited my friend 

Martina Potlach, a junior in the 
Taubman College of Architecture 

and Urban Planning, in her 
studio in the College’s newly 
renovated building on North 
campus. Students spend hours 
in the giant space working on 
countless iterations of projects, 
often late into the night. Since it 
is the beginning of the semester, 
while it might not seem like it, 
the studio was empty and clean 
compared to later in the semester 

when models and drafts of 

projects pile up on every surface 
in the room. Walking around, it 
was amazing to see the creativity 
and uniqueness of each student’s 

studio space, packed with old 
projects and materials, which 

they supply for themselves.
