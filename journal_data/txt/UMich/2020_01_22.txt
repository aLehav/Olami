After a recent change in the 
University of Michigan’s School 
of Nursing curriculum, Nursing 
students were offering to buy 
other students’ clinical shifts 
for as much $400 in order to 
switch their assigned times 
and locations throughout the 
Fall 2019 semester.
According 
to 
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim 

Broekhuizen, 
the 
change 
began in Fall 2019 and allows 
students to select their own 
clinical shifts based on their 
registration date instead of 
being assigned them. 
Nursing 
students 
have 
the opportunity to work in 
a variety of clinical areas, 
including 
positions 
at 
the 
University Hospital, Veterans 
Affairs and St. Joseph Mercy 
Hospital. These opportunities 
allow 
students 
to 
develop 

basic nursing skills related to 
delivering nursing care. 
Nursing sophomore Alissa 
Elanjian is currently completing 
her clinical shifts at the VA on 
Thursday nights. She explained 
to The Daily how particular 
times and locations were more 
favorable compared to others. 
“We 
have 
a 
nursing 
GroupMe, 
and 
for 
clinical 
times, 
people 
really, 
really 
like Michigan Medicine, and 
they really wanted Thursday 

morning,” Elanjian said. “A lot 
of the people are in sororities or 
frats, and their formals or semi-
formals are on Thursday nights 
or Friday nights, and so I think 
that’s a huge reason why.”
Nursing sophomore Moriah 
Lewis 
said 
some 
students 
wanted to switch times because 
they had jobs to help pay for 
their tuition and needed to 
accommodate for those times. 

The Literature, Science and 
the Arts Building opened its 
new attachment and renovated 
the first floor earlier this month. 
The new area includes multiple 
study spaces, conference rooms 
and offices for University of 
Michigan programs. The new 
addition will house the LSA 
Opportunity 
Hub, 
Transfer 
Student Center, LSA Student 
Government and Technology 
Services. 
All 
these 
groups 
were 
involved in the planning of the 

LSA Building renovation. Lisa 
Reiher, the manager of Capital 
Projects, the architecture firm 
hired for the renovation, told 
The Daily that each section of 
the new addition was a reflection 
of student needs.
“We actually met with each 
one of the groups: Student 
Government, 
the 
student 
recruitment for the Transfer 
Student 
Center, 
the 
Hub,” 
Reiher said. “We discussed with 
them their needs and we had an 
interior designer, and she came 
up with options to best suit their 
needs.”
Architecture 
and 
Study 
Spaces

The LSA Building additions 
include 
study 
spaces 
with 
plenty of outlets and spaces for 
collaboration 
and 
individual 
work. A second level was added 
that includes Brody study desks 
and conference rooms. 
The Scholarship Office will 
also be housed in the LSA 
Building and is expected to be 
completed in Fall 2020. 
The back wall of the building 
is 
comprised 
of 
windows, 
allowing natural sunlight to 
enter the building. As it gets 
sunnier throughout the day, the 
lights are designed to dim in 
order to reduce electricity use. 
The construction team took 

initiatives to make the LSA 
Building 
environmentally 
friendly during the process. 
The trees that were cut down 
in 
the 
process 
of 
creating 
additional 
space 
were 
then 
reused as tables in the building, 
according to Reiher. Many parts 
of the building are also made of 
lead silver, an energy efficient 
building material. 
Opportunity Hub
The 
Opportunity 
Hub 
is 
located on the first floor of 
the LSA Building. It has five 
interview rooms with seven 
more in the process of being 
built on the second level. 

Members 
of 
Michigan’s 
private and public sectors are 
uniting to propose a new civil 
rights protection petition for 
LGBTQ+ citizens. The Fair 
and Equal Michigan initiative 
aims 
to 
explicitly 
prohibit 
discrimination on the basis 
of 
sexual 
orientation 
and 
gender identity in the state’s 
legislation.
An 
interpretation 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Elliott-Larsen 
Civil Rights Act of 1976 by 
the 
Michigan 
Civil 
Rights 
Commission in 2018 previously 
defined such discrimination 
as “sex” bias. The act protects 
people 
from 
discrimination 
based on 10 factors, including 
religion; however, there are 
currently 
no 
protections 
for 
LGBTQ+ 
individuals 
in 
employment 
and 
public 
accommodations. 
Kalamazoo 
County 
Commissioner Tracy Hall said 
the protections must be granted 
now.
“We are one of too many 
states where people can be 
fired for who they love and how 
they identify,” Hall said. “And 
it’s time to change that.” 

After a group of students in the 

School of Social Work penned an op-ed 

criticizing the curriculum taught 

in a mandatory course, the school 

is working to address the authors’ 

concerns.

Social Work students Justin Woods, 

Samuel Rentschler and the students of 

Social Work 504, Section 4 submitted 

the op-ed to The Daily on Dec. 4, 2019.

The op-ed highlights three main 

gaps: the structure of topics of Social 

Work 504, the ways Social Work 

504 chooses to discuss and present 

racism and an assigned reading on the 

effectiveness of diversity courses.

“Instead of unequivocally and 

substantively 
interrogating 
the 

systemic white supremacy that allows 

for incoming graduate students to 

be unaware of the social privilege of 

whiteness, we engage in a cursory 

and trepidatious overview of the 

uncomfortable 
topic,” 
the 
op-ed 

stated. “It would appear as the course 

is developed with the white student 

majority in mind.” 

The authors suggested four courses 

of action to placate the situation, and 

they started a petition for the cause. 

They called for the addition of a 

mandatory class on race and ethnicity 

in social work using a critical race 

theory lens, as well as a course on “anti-

oppressive practices in social work.” 

In the wake of an executive 
order 
targeting 
what 
President Donald Trump has 
described as anti-Semitism at 
colleges across the country, 
student 
activist 
groups 
on campus are concerned 
about possible implications 
for University students and 
free speech surrounding the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
The Dec. 11 executive order 
effectively adds a provision 
to Title VI of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964, which allows 
the government to withhold 
federal financial assistance 
from public institutions that 
do not protect against various 
forms of discrimination on 
the basis of race, color and 
national origin.
As a result of the executive 
order, Title VI will now 
protect 
against, 
as 
the 

official White House briefing 
stated, 
“prohibited 
forms 
of discrimination rooted in 
anti-Semitism as vigorously 
as against all other forms of 
discrimination prohibited by 
Title VI.”
The final order did not 
specify 
whether 
Judaism 
would be interpreted as a 
race or nationality. Instead, it 
instructed the Department of 
Education to use a particular 
definition in combating anti-
Semitism. 

Jeffrey 
Veidlinger, 

Director of the University’s 
Frankel Center for Judaic 
Studies, explained what the 
definition 
and 
the 
order 
mean.
“All it did was say the 
Department 
of 
Education 
should 
use 
the 
working 
definition of anti-Semitism 
in 
evaluation 
Title 
VI 
programs,” Veidlinger said.

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council 
met 
Tuesday 
night 
and 
discussed 
anti-Israel 
protests, 
adding 
youth 
members 
to 
the 
Environmental 
Commission 
and 
how 
best to proceed regarding 
contamination 
from 
the 
Gelman Dioxane plume. 
During public comment, 
multiple 
community 
members spoke regarding 
the 
Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, condemning U.S. 
military aid to Israel. Anti-
Israel 
protester 
Henry 
Herskovitz, 
a 
defendant 
in a recent lawsuit over 
a 16-year protest at an 
Ann 
Arbor 
synagogue, 
addressed comments from 
a City Council meeting 
earlier this month in which 
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, 
D-Ward 
3, 
called him racist and anti-
Semitic. 
Ackerman 
explained 
Herskovitz’s history of anti-
Israel 
picketing 
outside 
the Jewish synagogue and 
told attendees Herskovitz 
denies the Holocaust at 
meetings. Councilmember 
Julie Grand, D-Ward 3, 
supported Ackerman and 
criticized 
Herskovitz’s 
behavior 
during 
such 
protests. Councilmembers 
were interrupted multiple 
times by outbursts from 
a 
community 
member 
shouting in protest about 
Israeli violence in Palestine. 
Councilmember 
Ali 
Ramlawi, 
D-Ward 
5, 
responded 
with 
a 
call 
to 
order, 
expressing 
frustration over the time 
spent personally addressing 
Herskovitz 
rather 
than 
focusing on the issues on 
the agenda.
“I am Palestinian, and I 

have not made it this forum 
to 
express 
my 
political 
beliefs and my personal 
positions, and I think this 
body should be held to 
a higher level where we 
should be able to take a tax 
and move on and discuss 
the business that this city 
has elected us to discuss,” 
Ramlawi said. “I have my 
personal positions, and to 
this point, I’ve kept them 
to myself, and I wish others 
would do so, so we could 
get on to the work of the 
people. This body should 
not be attacking members 
in the audience, and I 
find that a very troubling 
direction that we’re going 
in.”
Ackerman 
and 
Grand 
responded 
that 
it 
was 
necessary for leaders to call 
out hate in the community.
As 
councilmembers 
continued to discuss this 
topic, 
Councilmembers 
Kathy Griswold, D-Ward 
2, Jeff Hayner, D-Ward 1 
and Ramlawi temporarily 
retreated to the council 
workroom until the Council 
returned to issues on the 
agenda. 
Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor said he believes the 
protests at the Ann Arbor 
synagogue are relevant to 
the community.
“I 
believe 
that 
the 
ongoing protests at temple 
are a local issue; they are 
a local issue because they 
impact 
deeply 
members 
of the community on a 
consistent 
basis,” 
Taylor 
said. 
“I 
believe 
those 
protests are improper, I 
believe 
that 
protests 
at 
a house of worship are 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
values of Ann Arbor, and I 
believe they should end.” 
The 
Council 
later 
considered implementation 
of a resolution that had 
passed in June to add two 

youth voting members to 
the 13-member board of 
the city’s Environmental 
Commission. 
Though 
youth was initially defined 
as those aged 14 to 25, 
Councilmember 
Jack 
Eaton, D-Ward 4, proposed 
an amendment to change 
the age range to 16 to 25, 
believing that 16-year-olds 
would be better equipped 
to participate in policy-
making. 
Grand 
contended 
that 
some leaders of the climate 
change protest are as young 
as 14 or 15 and should be 
allowed to apply, as they 
will 
only 
be 
appointed 
to a position if they are 
adequately qualified. 
The 
majority 
of 
councilmembers, however, 
believed it would be in 
the best interest of all to 
restrict the age minimum 
to 
16. 
Councilmember 
Jane 
Lumm, 
I-Ward 
2, 
highlighted the importance 
of ensuring the experience 
is as beneficial as possible 
to youth members.
“It’s all about making this 
experience beneficial and 
positive, onboarding young 
people, orienting them in 
the appropriate way so that 
it’s a good experience, and 
they build confidence as a 
result of this experience 
and their leadership skills 
and competency,” Lumm 
said. “So, I’d like to see us 
do this in a more, sort of, 
thoughtful, planned way, 
not just lower the age and 
add these folks.”
The 
amendment 
to 
change the age to 16 passed. 
The 
Council 
also 
discussed 
whether 
to 
postpone 
voting 
on 
a 
resolution to support the 
Environmental Protection 
Agency listing the site of the 
Gelman Plume, the spread 
of dioxane in groundwater 
contaminating 
drinking 

water, as a “Superfund” 
site, which would begin a 
long-term cleanup by the 
EPA. 
 
Councilmembers 
Hayner and Nelson opposed 
the postponement, urging 
immediate action. 
However, other members 
believed it more important 
to 
deliberate 
carefully 
before 
taking 
action. 
Taylor 
emphasized 
the 
importance of consulting 
with 
the 
public 
before 
moving forward. 
“I believe it is wise that we 
have the consent judgment 
in hand before we make the 
decision,” Taylor said. “I 
think further, it’s wise that 
we have an opportunity 
to distribute the consent 
judgment to the public for 
their feedback before we 
make any decision.”
The vote was postponed 
until the Council meeting 
on February 3. 
During communications 
from the city administrator, 
Lori 
Roddy, 
Executive 
Director of Neutral Zone, 
a 
youth-driven 
teen 
center, spoke about the 
benefits of the program’s 
partnership with the city. 
Neutral Zone was awarded 
a 
$10,000 
grant 
from 
the city in May to create 
the 
Capacity 
Building 
for Job Corps Program, 
which provides mentors, 
tuition 
scholarships 
and 
employment opportunities 
to underprivileged youth. 
Roddy was joined by two 
participants of the program 
who spoke to their positive 
experiences in the program.
“You have really created a 
space where, two years ago, 
honestly, I’m not sure many 
of our Black youth felt like 
they belonged in this city, 
and you’ve really created a 
warm, supportive, inviting 
space where they have a 
platform to be successful,” 
Roddy said.

Jan. 22, 1970: New Human Rights Commission: 
Stronger code draws mixed response from community

Community leaders have given 
a mixed response to Ann Arbor’s 
new 
human 
rights 
ordinance 
which imposes stronger penalties 
against discrimination. 
While Mayor Robert Harris 
considers the ordinance “probably 
the 
best 
anti-discrimination 
code in the country,” others are 
concerned that the new Human 
Rights 
Commission 
does 
not 
have broad enough powers to 
adequately 
probe 
community 
tension. 
The 
ordinance, 
enacted 
by 
City Council Monday, abolishes 

the present Human Relations 
Commission and, along with the 
new commission, creates a hearing 
panel of human rights examiners. 
The examiners are empowered to 
issue cease and resist orders in 
cases of discrimination.
If the examiners decide a 
discriminatory 
practice 
was 
committed, 
a 
newly-created 
Department of Human Rights 
can petition Washtenaw County 
Circuit Court to order the person 
to pay a fine of $1000 per violation.
The department, responsible 
to the city administrator, handles 

investigations of discrimination 
charges and can request and can 
request the subpoena of records 
and witness, enforced by the 
Circuit Court.
The Human Rights Commission 
will oversee the city government’s 
efforts to eliminate discrimination 
and ease tensions within the 
various departments of the city.
Harris, who drafted much of 
the ordinance, is pleased with the 
scope of the penalties—especially 
the fines—imposed on persons 
found guilty of discrimination.
City 
Administrator 
Guy 

Marcom and Ann Arbor NAACP 
member Dr. Albert Wheeler of 
the medical school agree. “The 
ordinance spells out in much better 
terms 
the 
anti-discrimination 
laws,” says Larson.
Others are not so positive. 
Mrs. Mildred Officer, a member 
of the present HRC, fears that 
the community may not have the 
opportunity to voice its grievances 
before the new Human Rights 
Commission.
She is concerned will involve 
itself 
with 
overseeing 
city 
departments instead if serving as 

a forum for individual problems. 
Commissioners 
Theodore 
St. 
Antoine 
and 
Lloyd 
Williams, 
who are generally pleased with 
the ordinance, also believe the 
commission should extend its 
authority to act as a center for 
citizen’s complaints. 
Commissioner 
Paul 
Wasson 
sees few desirable elements in the 
ordinance.
“The human rights department 
should not be responsible for the 
mayor and city administrator but 
to all the people of all the sectors 
of the community,” he says.

Outgoing HRC Director David 
Cowley contends toe ordinance 
places too much emphasis on 
specific 
discrimination 
cases 
and does not provide an adequate 
structure for examining general 
discriminatory practices.
Others believe the department 
should be free from the city 
administrator’s 
jurisdiction. 
They contend that, to operate 
effectively, 
the 
department 
must be autonomous and able to 
undertake broad investigations of 
discrimination and tensions in the 
city.

The rooms have AI technology 
on the computers and dry-erase 
walls to make it easier to conduct 
job interviews.
LSA senior Taylor Lind said 
she encourages students to spend 
time at the Opportunity Hub and 
explore the new LSA addition. 
“I’m really excited to see how 
students can utilize this new 
space,” Lind said. “I think it’s a 
really unique one, especially for 
a college as large as LSA, because 
it’s hard to find a central space 
to hang out as opposed to other 
colleges. I would just really 
encourage LSA students to step 
out of their comfort zone and 
explore a new favorite study spot 
eventually.”
Hannah Lozon, operations lead 
of Opportunity Hub, said she is 
excited to see students using the 
resources from the Opportunity 
Hub. 
“We’re most excited about, I 
would say, from my perspective, 
seeing students coming in and 
using the building now,” Lozon 
said. “Each day we’ve been open 
since the semester started, there 
are more and more students every 
day, students are just finding 
their nooks, so that’s fantastic. 
And then, of course, seeing the 
Opportunity Hub has been able 
to do services for students, where 
we have much more space, which 
is really amazing.” 
24/7 Market 
Food will be available in the 
building addition via the 24/7 
Market, a self-serving market 
that takes debit and credit cards. 
The market will have a variety of 
different options from granola 
bars to energy drinks and meals, 
as well as a Starbucks coffee 
machine where students can 
make their own beverages.
Transfer Center
The Transfer Student Center 
is a space for all transfer students 
at 
the 
University 
to 
study, 
and holds events to help these 
students 
acclimate. 
Transfer 
student ambassadors are placed 
in the Center to answer any 
questions and provide advice.
Commuter students are also 
welcome to all the resources for 
transfer students. There will be 
lockers in the LSA Building for 
commuter students to keep their 
items while they are on campus. 
LSA senior Samantha Tosa is 
a transfer student ambassador. 
She said she is excited to see how 
the space will support transfer 
students on campus.
“The transfer centers are 

a really great date spot for 
transfer students in general, 
because, like I said, there was 
no space before specifically for 
transfer students,” Tosa said. 
“It’s really nice though … We’ve 
had students just come in and 
sit down and study to the point 
where I’ve been able to recognize 
them, and now we’re friends. It’s 
a really great start to make and 
build connections with other 
people who are going through a 
similar experience.”
LSA Student Government
LSA 
Student 
Government, 
previously housed in Mason 
Hall, will relocate to the new 
building addition as well. 
Brian 
Wong, 
president 
of 
LSA Student Government and 
LSA senior, told The Daily he is 
excited to have a space central to 
campus.
“I 
think 
we’re 
incredibly 
happy about this new building,” 
Wong said. “We’re glad it’s open 
… Jumping into a new place 
really helps with coming up with 
new creative processes and ideas 
that we’re really excited about.”
Technology Services
Technology 
services 
will 
also have a presence in the LSA 
Building at the Navigation Desk 
on the first floor. Starting in mid-
February, students will be able to 
rent out chargers, adapters and 
graphing calculators. 
Sanam 
Arab, 
manager 
of 
Programs and Patron Services, 
told The Daily she will be 
collecting 
student 
feedback 
to see what other equipment 
students would like to have 
available from their services.
“We offer a lot of different 
services to students, faculty and 
staff. One of the things we’ll be 
bringing to the Navigation Desk 
is our equipment loan service,” 
Arab said. “In our other centers, 
we rent out cameras, laptops, 
digital 
audio 
recorders 
and 
things like that. We will see what 
would be the interest here, and 
we’ll bring those here to circulate 
from this location as well.”
Homewarming Party 
This Friday, Jan. 24, the 
LSA Building will be hosting a 
“Homewarming Party” from 2 
p.m. to 4 p.m., with food, trivia 
and games. LSA Associate Dean 
Rosario Cabello told The Daily 
she is looking forward to seeing 
LSA students at the event.
“I’m very excited about this 
because I’ve spent a lot of time 
working on this, and I want 
students to come,” Cabello said. “I 
hope to invite all LSA students to 
come down this Friday and really 
check it out. Check out the space 
and get their swag.”

They also asked that the School of 
Social Work require a minimum 
proportion of assigned readings 
written by indigenous authors and 
people of color, and that SSW “forge 
a connection with the Center for 
Institutional Diversity to support the 
faculty’s comfort in teaching across 
racial and ethnic differences.”
On Dec. 10, 2019, the School of 
Social Work sent a statement to 
the social work community at the 
University addressing the issues 
presented in the op-ed.
“We know that our work is not 
done and there is much more to do,” 
the statement read. “The op-ed speaks 
to a disjuncture that the writers 
experienced between what the School 
says and what we do. Our faculty 
and staff commitment towards anti-
racism and anti-oppressive work 
continue to be aspirational. This is 
true for our school as well as our 
profession. This means working 
towards continuous improvement in 
all we do.” 

In an interview with The Daily, 
Woods said he was grateful that 
the School of Social Work formally 
recognized the issues.
“When we first got the response, 
I was encouraged,” Woods said. 
“I definitely think there’s some 
level of validation from it, that the 
administration took away to say 
seriously they were open from 
dialogue and they’re willing to engage 
us in a meaningful way.” 
The School of Social Work’s 
statement opened an opportunity 
for dialogue between the authors of 
the op-ed and the administration, 
according to Woods. He said they 
held a meeting at the beginning of 
the winter term, but added that the 
meeting left the authors of the op-ed 
feeling uncertain about the future of 
the curriculum.
“I think for us, I was really 
hoping to get a response from the 
administration on our four specific 
recommendations that we outlined,” 
Woods said. “I think there was 
some conversation on a couple of 
the points, but they also then took 
the opportunity to give us some 
context on why things are the way 

they are … For me personally, I was 
hoping to have real dialogue about 
our recommendations and a specific 
response to either ‘we can do that,’ 
or ‘we can’t’ or making some sort of 
counter offer. I think we didn’t really 
get that.” 
After the release of the op-ed, 
the authors received an influx of 
messages from current Social Work 
students and alumni voicing their 
support. 
Social Work alum Violeta Donawa 
noted the challenges of having a 
class filled with people of different 
experiences.
“You have students with a wealth 
of lived experiences who are not 
starting out at social justice 101,” 
Donawa said. “The difficulty with 
that is having students who are much 
further along in these conversations 
and those types of students getting 
challenged in really rudimentary 
ways that can feel draining and 
exhausting.” 
The 2016 Student Campus Climate 
Survey on Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion, — the most recently taken 
survey — reports that one in six 
graduate students reported feeling 

that over the past 12 months they 
have been discriminated against at 
the University of Michigan. 
Donawa 
called 
attention 
to 
these surveys, commenting on the 
number of students who have felt 
discriminated against.
“Surveys have revealed a number 
of students who have expressed 
discomfort in discussing race, who, in 
some way shape or form, have felt like 
their voices have been marginalized 
because 
of 
the 
discomfort 
in 
discussing race,” Donawa said. “If 
you’ve been having to explain your 
identity in so many areas of life … 
students can shut down; they can 
decide they don’t want to participate.”
Donawa applauded the authors of 
the op-ed for calling attention to the 
issue and stressed the importance of 
change. 
“Our program is 16 months, 20 
months, 12 months, and so you end 
up with a very rapid graduation rate 
of students, so it’s very hard to get 
change to stick in that short amount 
of time,” Donawa said. “What the 
incoming MSW class is encountering, 
or at least the students from 504 that 
wrote the original article, they’re 

filling the remnants of the fact that 
the change is still in progress … You 
can’t relegate solutions to a specific 
department, you can’t relegate to 
a certain office, you can’t relegate 
solutions to voluntary activities. 
That’s not how institutional change 
happens.”
Chidimma Ozor is a Master of 
Social Work candidate who was able 
to take advantage of the Social Work 
curriculum and craft it to better suit 
her needs and experiences.
“I’ve noticed that there is a focus 
on those that don’t have very much 
experience with racism,” Ozor said.
In an interview with The Daily, 
Lorraine Gutiérrez, associate dean for 
educational programs at the School of 
Social Work, addressed some of the 
concerns regarding the Social Work 
504.
“Because these classes are so 
diverse in terms of the background 
students come from — not only from 
parts of the U.S., parts of Michigan, 
but also parts of the world — it can 
be challenging to figure out where 
everyone is and what their past 
knowledge is,” Gutiérrez said. “The 
dynamics of that class can get very 

complicated because somebody may 
ask a question that other students may 
feel is very naive and ill-informed, but 
in fact, they might be asking it because 
of what their own background and life 
experience has been.”
She also addressed the class 
content, 
including 
the 
call 
to 
move toward introducing critical 
race theory, the social scientific 
framework used to examine the role 
of race in society.
“Some 
of 
the 
things 
they 
recommended, for example, critical 
race theory, are things that could 
be part of the class,” Gutiérrez said. 
“The class is supposed to come from a 
theory-base; the class is not intended 
to focus entirely on race. … There 
should be anti-racist and critical race 
focus in that class, but it’s not the total 
focus, because the focus in the class is 
broader than that.”
To address the issue with the 
diversity reading assigned in the class, 
Gutiérrez said she hopes to reevaluate 
a few of the assigned pieces.

“Someone 
in 
my 
other 
clinical lab group was saying, 
‘I work on Friday nights, and 
Friday nights are when I make 
most of my money,’ and she has 
clinicals Friday nights, so she 
was just saying how it wasn’t 
fair,” Lewis said. “She was 
upset that now she couldn’t 
work and make her money, 
but other people that had 
money could just switch out 
of it to party. And she was just 
frustrated and trying to figure 
out how to pay for the rest of 
her schooling.”
Many students were also 
upset if they had more class 

credits but still registered at a 
later time than students who 
had fewer credits, Elanjian 
explained.
“My adviser told me that we 
were using the entire University 
slot time generator so not the 
specific nursing school for 
credit,” Elanjian said. “People 
were upset because they had 
way more credits than others 
but ended up having to pick 
their classes last on the last day 
possible. There was a problem 
with that, but the advisers are 
actually working on switching 
that for next year.”
Jayne Hubscher, a Nursing 
senior and president of the U-M 
Student Nurses’ Association, 
spoke to The Daily about the 
schedules and the impact on 

the student culture at the 
University.
“I feel like it’s not really 
surprising to me because it 
does kind of fit in with the 
competitiveness of the Nursing 
School that I’ve experienced,” 
Hubscher said. “And there’s 
always been drama that goes 
on with different things, like 
academically, so this is just like 
another tip of the iceberg.” 
Hubscher further said some 
students 
prefer 
placements 
at 
the 
University 
Hospital 
rather than at the VA due to 
its location farther away from 
campus.
“No one wants to go the VA 
because you have to take the 
bus, and you have to get up 
way earlier,” Hubscher said. 

“They used to not let you give 
medication there, which really 
hinders your education. So, 
if someone got placed there, 
they would definitely want to 
pay for a position at Michigan 
Medicine.”
Broekhuizen told The Daily 
that in the past, students 
have requested more input 
in 
their 
clinical 
section 
assignments. In response, the 
Nursing School piloted a new 
registration 
process 
at 
the 

start of this school year. This 
process 
provided 
students 
with a system that allowed 
them a choice in their clinicals, 
Broekhuizen explained. 
“This 
was 
an 
isolated 
case and did not affect any 
students’ learning experience,” 

Broekhuizen 
said. 
“There 
is no evidence of additional 
instances.”
To address the situation, 
Bonnie 
Hagerty, 
associate 
dean 
for 
undergraduate 
affairs, sent an email on Dec. 
5, 2019 to the sophomore and 
junior undergraduate nursing 
students. 
“This is unbecoming of what 
we strive for in nursing, that 
of integrity, compassion, and 
inclusivity,” 
Hagerty 
wrote. 
“No 
student 
may 
pressure 
another student to make a 
switch, including making offers 
of monetary compensation or 
other incentives.”
If continued, Hagerty wrote, 
students 
risked 
disciplinary 
action, including an honor code 

violation. 
Laurent 
Hokanson, 
a 
freshman nursing major at 
Grand Valley State University, 
is currently in the middle of 
applying to the U-M School of 
Nursing. She spoke to The Daily 
about the competitive nature of 
nursing schools in general and 
its impact on student culture.
“I cannot imagine selling 
my position,” Hokanson said. 
“It just seems unethical. It 
implies that some departments 
are better than others in health 
care, and I think that is unjust. 
We’re caring for people. It 
shouldn’t matter what form of 
care we’re giving. I think every 
department is beneficial. It can 
teach you amazing things.”

“It was from an organization 
called 
the 
International 
Holocaust 
Remembrance 
Alliance, and it has already 
been accepted by the State 
Department and was already 
widely used within the Office 
of Civil Rights.”
The IHRA definition used 
in the order has been widely 
criticized for the examples 
of modern anti-Semitism to 
which it refers. One example 
describes 
anti-Semitism 
as 
“denying 
the 
Jewish 
people their right to self-
determination by claiming 
that the existence of a State 
of Israel is a racist endeavor.”
According to Student 1, 
a member of Direct Action 
for Palestine who wished 
to remain anonymous due 
to 
fear 
of 
professional 
repercussions, 
the 
IHRA 
definition of anti-Semitism is 
controversial.
“It has been sort of a site 
of controversy because the 
issue with the way that 
IHRA defines it is that it 
conflates anti-Semitism with 
critique of Israel,” Student 
1 said. “So that is basically 
the lens through which I am 
understanding that defining 
Judaism 
as 
a 
nationality 
is 
really 
cementing 
that 
definition of anti-Semitism, 
which I believe it’s a grossly 
incorrect way of thinking 
about it.”
In a statement, the Anti-
Defamation 
League, 
a 
nonprofit that fights anti-
Semitism, praised the order, 
noting that it supported the 
IHRA definition. 
“This 
Executive 
Order 
is 
an 
important 
step 
acknowledging the growing 
concern about rising anti-
Semitism 
on 
American 
college 
campuses,” 
the 
statement read. “Including 
Jews in Title VI protections 
is 
something 
that 
ADL 
and 
previous 
presidential 
administrations 
have 
supported for years. ADL has 
likewise long supported the 
IHRA definition, which has 
been adopted by more than 
20 countries and entities 
around the world as a non-
legally binding definition of 
anti-Semitism.”
LSA senior Becca Lubow, 
a student leader for If Not 
Now, a student organization 
opposing 
the 
Israeli 

occupation of the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, said she does 
not support the executive 
order.
“I 
think 
that 
anti-
Semitism 
is 
present 
and 
rising on college campuses, 
but Trump can’t be trusted 
to define anti-Semitism for 
us, because he incites deadly 
white 
nationalist 
violence 
against 
our 
community,” 
Lubow said. “He calls us 
disloyal; he refers to Israel 
as ‘your country’ because 
he believes we don’t really 
belong here.” 
Veidlinger 
agreed 
anti-
Semitism was rising and 
should be addressed, but said 
he did not believe regulating 
speech on universities was 
the correct approach. 
“I think it’s significant to 
look at the definition of anti-
Semitism and recognize that, 
although we haven’t seen that 
much in universities, I do 
think it is a growing problem 
around the world and in the 
United States,” Veidlinger 
said. “We have seen tragic 
evidence of that in the last 
few months, so I do think we 
need to pay serious attention, 
but I don’t think cracking 
down 
on 
institutions 
of 
higher learning is the way to 
do that.” 
Arwa Gayar, Public Policy 
senior and co-president of 
Students Allied for Freedom 
and Equality, expressed a 
similar 
belief 
that 
while 
combating 
anti-Semitism 
is important, this order is 
potentially problematic. 
“I do obviously support 
legislation 
that 
seeks 
to 
combat 
anti-Semitism, 
especially in a time where 
there’s 
rising 
white 
supremacy and there’s a need 
for these things,” Gayar said. 
“But I also am extremely 
hesitant because I recognize 
that a lot of times, people 
kind 
of 
undermine 
anti-
Semitism and throw it at 
things or movements that 
are, for example, critical of 
policy of the State of Israel.”
According 
to 
Student 
1, 
Palestinian 
activist 
organizations 
have 
historically struggled with 
issues of free speech on 
campus.
“In 
organizing 
around 
Palestine, what we call is the 
‘Palestinian exception to free 
speech,’” Student 1 said. “In 
the United States, you can 
have a position on something, 
you can advocate for that 

and be vocal about that, but 
when it comes to Palestine, 
all 
of 
a 
sudden, 
things 
become very controversial, 
and then an issue arises 
which 
also 
Palestinian 
activists, 
in 
particular, 
have been asked to step 
back and step down. Their 
calls for justice have been 
framed 
as 
discriminatory 
and 
hateful, 
and 
there’s 
been administrative action 
against those activists for a 
long time.”
Lubow 
also 
voiced 
concerns 
that 
the 
order 
would limit the free speech 
of students on campus. She 
said she believed Trump 
was 
using 
the 
order 
to 
silence 
opposition 
to 
his 
administration’s policies. 
“As 
a 
Jewish 
college 
student, I know that this 
order isn’t meant to keep me 
safe. It’s meant to silence, in 
particular, Palestinian and 
Muslim 
students,” 
Lubow 
said. “It could even silence 
Jewish students who are 
critical of occupation and 
the 
Israeli 
government 
and 
students 
who 
speak 
out against the occupation 
on campuses are already 
targeted and censored. Now 
Trump wants to crack down 
even further, and he’s doing it 
in the name of Jewish safety, 
which makes me angry. He 
has no right to co-opt our 
voice in that way.” 
Gayar said the University 
has 
faced 
challenges 
in 
handling free speech issues.
“College 
campuses, 
especially this University, 
in recent years have kind of 
struggled with free speech 
and kind of evaluating, what 
exactly is free speech? At 
what expense does freedom 
of speech come? And kind of 
acknowledging that freedom 
of speech is something that’s 
very valuable,” Gayar said. 
“But then again, you know, I 
think as a country we value 
free speech and our ability 
to speak our minds and our 
ability to, you know, be able 
to exercise, our personal 
politics, additional views.” 
Miriam Saperstein, LSA 
junior and student organizer 
for Jewish Voice for Peace, 
said there is an important 
distinction 
between 
free 
speech 
and 
anti-Semitic 
speech which may not be 
taken into account when 
implementing this order.
“Palestinian students at 
this University and across 

the 
country 
are 
already 
being targeted,” Saperstein 
said. “I guess I’d put it 
simply that a feature of 
Palestinian freedom depends 
on supporting, not silencing, 
this important advocacy.”
Student 1 said that the 
capacity of the executive 
order 
to 
stifle 
student 
freedoms should prompt a 
response from the University.
“Now 
for 
me, 
the 
executive order is a really 
egregious 
stance 
on 
this 
government that impedes on 
the possibility of academic 
freedom and student activism 
on campus,” Student 1 said. 
“And so, what the University 
should do — what I believe 
they’re obligated to do — is to 
take an active stance against 
that executive order.”
Saperstein 
said 
the 
University 
should 
make 
specific efforts to support 
Palestinian 
students 
on 
campus, especially following 
the executive order. 
“I 
think 
the 
way 
the 
University supports dialogue 
with feeling no need to 
actually repair for the harm 
the University has caused 
Palestinian 
students 
(is 
problematic),” 
Saperstein 
said. “There needs to be an 
acknowledgment first that 
we can’t just talk to each 
other, we need to change the 
material conditions of what 
it means to live in Palestine 
and to be a Palestinian in the 
U.S. when there’s so much 
suppression.” 
The 
Jewish 
Resource 
Center and Chabad House of 
Ann Arbor did not respond 
to requests for comment. 
Hillel could not provide a 
statement to The Daily in 
time for publication.
University 
spokeswoman 
Kim Broekhuizen told The 
Daily the University aims 
to 
provide 
an 
inclusive 
environment for all students. 
“The 
University 
works 
hard each and every day to 
foster an environment that 
supports all our students 
and 
their 
diverse 
faith 
traditions,” 
Broekhuizen 
said. 
“This 
includes 
our 
work 
to 
support 
Jewish 
students and to call out anti-
Semitism, which is anathema 
to our mission and values. We 
do and will, of course, comply 
with the law. But, more 
importantly, we do this work 
because it is the right thing 
to do.”

ELI FRIEDMAN | LETTER TO THE EDITOR
O

n 
Jan. 
17, 
The 
Daily 
published 
an 
opinion 
column 
entitled 
“Language 
in 
a 
politically 
correct 
2020.” 
While 
passionate, 
the 
piece’s underlying point was 
fundamentally problematic.
The article begins with an 
appeal to the First Amendment 
of the Constitution, which 
states that “Congress shall 
make no law ... abridging 
the freedom of speech.” I 
absolutely agree that this is 
a fundamental right, and the 
author is correct that it has 
been 
largely 
unrestricted 
by law. This is where the 
comparison 
to 
Orwell’s 
“1984,” drawn in the following 
paragraph, falters: Nobody is 
jailed, tortured or killed in the 
United States for politically 
incorrect speech. How can 
public pressure “work just 
as well to shame people into 
silence” when articles like 
this one can be published? 
How can preachers stand on 
the Diag shouting hate speech 
without fear of arrest? The 
U.S. is freer than the author 
of the article imagines, and 
certainly freer than Orwell’s 
dystopia (unless I’ve missed a 
“1984”-style torture chamber 
hidden beneath Angell Hall). 
Herein lies the crux of the 
issue: If one has the freedom 
to be politically incorrect, 
another 
has 
the 
freedom 
to call them out for it. This 
concept is the nucleus of 
political correctness; it is a 
back-and-forth of free speech 
exactly as guaranteed in the 
First Amendment. Therefore, I 
argue, political correctness is a 
critical component of modern 
society. 
Ideas 
will 
never 
develop if they are allowed 

to go unchecked. And let’s 
be clear: Those who espouse 
political 
incorrectness 
do 
not want their ideas checked. 
Rather, they prefer to express 
their 
opinions 
and 
shield 
themselves from criticism with 
terms like “snowflake” or “PC 
culture.”
Another central idea in the 
piece is the claim that actions 
matter more than words, and 
therefore we should not judge 
people based on those words. 
What this misses is that words 
often act as actions, whether or 
not the speaker intends them to. 
In sociology there is a concept 
called “performative language,” 
which describes expressions 
that count as actions in and of 
themselves. The idea is that 
phrases like “I do” and “I quit” 
can change social situations, 
thereby functioning as actions. 
Similarly, 
the 
language 
we 
use has real effects on others. 
Depending 
on 
how 
they’re 
wielded, words can and often 
do cause legitimate sadness, 
fear or anger.
We can’t control how others 
react to our words, but we can 
control what we say. Actions 
and words are both important. 
They both reveal a person’s 
character. 
Finally, we arrive at the 
intersection 
of 
political 
correctness and creativity. The 
author says that her friend’s 
creative writing, in addition 
to her own, was criticized for 
being 
politically 
incorrect. 
Furthermore, she argues that 
forcing authors to write in a 
politically correct fashion will 
make all stories the same (“a 
lot 
of 
princess-and-princess 
fairytales”) and will make it 
impossible to tell who actually 
supports equality.

The advancement of creative 
literature will not be stunted 
by 
political 
correctness. 
Countless 
authors 
writing 
today have not been forced 
to hand in their pens even in 
this new era in which we find 
ourselves. 
Infinite 
stories 
can still be told. If the only 
politically correct story one 
can imagine is the “princess-
and-princess 
fairytale,” 
perhaps the fault lies not in 
society but in oneself.
In 
regard 
to 
this 
contentious creative writing 
class, I remind the original 
author of the final line of 
her piece: “The only way 
to combat ignorance is to 
let people speak freely and 
convince them of their ill-
guided 
conceptions.” 
I 
agree. This, as I’ve tried to 
impress, is what political 
correctness is. It is exactly 
what the professor was trying 
to do — let the students 
write freely, notice an ill-
guided conception and try to 
convince them of it. Don’t run 
from political correctness, 
let it guide debate and lead 
to greater understanding for 
both parties.
I see how this letter could 
be 
construed 
as 
an 
arm 
of 
the 
politically 
correct 
establishment trying to silence 
the free-thinkers. It’s not that. 
I’m just a student who read 
another student’s column and 
disagreed. Like good political 
correctness, I do not want to 
silence expression, but instead 
push back on an idea that I see 
as harmful. Can’t we agree that 
is worthwhile?

Donald Trump is a symptom of a larger problem
T

he 
race 
to 
win 
the 
Democratic 
presidential 
nomination 
continues, 
with 
the 
large 
selection 
of 
candidates 
narrowing 
ever so slowly. There are 14 
candidates still vying for the 
nomination, although the most 
recent debate in Los Angeles, 
California, only had seven. The 
remaining politicians are all 
trying their hardest to make 
their presence known for the 
upcoming Iowa caucus on Feb. 
3. Throughout the campaign, 
hot button issues have been 
debated 
and 
discussed, 
including 
but 
not 
limited 
to universal healthcare and 
climate change. But the one 
thing that unites most of them 
is this — President Donald 
Trump’s defeat in 2020.
Of 
course, 
this 
is 
a 
no-brainer. 
They 
want 
to 
win the Oval Office, and 
he’s the opponent. But there 
is more substance to it than 
just that. One of the biggest 
concerns for the Democrats is 
focusing too much on Trump 
specifically. Beating Trump 
in the upcoming election isn’t 
enough to stop his malignant 
brand 
of 
absolutism 
and 
demagoguery. In the sixth 
Democratic 
debate, 
the 
question of “Who can beat 
Trump?” was discussed a lot. 
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Mn., 
succinctly 
demonstrated 
the fixation with her line 
that the Democrats “should 
have someone heading up 
this ticket that has actually 
won and been able to show 
they can gather the support 
(they) 
talk 
about 
with 
moderate Republicans and 
independents, as well as a 
fired-up Democratic base.” 
She cited her Midwestern 
ties to bolster her claim of 
electability. 
Former 
Vice 
President 
Joe 
Biden 
can 
be quoted in his campaign 
announcement warning that 
“if we give Donald Trump 
eight years in the White 
House, he will forever and 
fundamentally 
alter 
the 
character of this nation.” The 
problem is that he already 
has, and that none of the 
problems that gave rise to 
him in the first place are 
being addressed. Trump is a 
symptom of the country’s real 
problems, and his shadow 
will loom over us until we 
tackle the source.
As painful as it is to look 
back at the election cycle 

in 2016, it’s unfortunately a 
must in forming a strategy 
not only for 2020, but for the 
future presidencies to come. 
But rather than looking at the 
strengths of the opponent, 
more focus needs to be put on 
the Democratic inadequacy.
One of the biggest failures 
for the Democrats was in 
the Rust Belt, the group of 
Midwestern states that have 
taken the biggest losses from 
globalization and automation. 
The swing states of Michigan, 
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin 
turned red and gave candidate 
Trump the electoral votes he 
needed to win. The margin of 
victory? Less than one percent 
in all three states. His win 
wasn’t a guarantee. The win 
in Michigan can be chalked 
up to decreased participation 
in urban areas, and increased 
participation in rural ones. 

Trump was able to appeal to 
the disgruntled workers of the 
Midwest, allowing them to 
channel their anger towards 
things like immigration and 
“the left” (despite neither of 
those things really causing 
their 
problems). 
Wayne 
County voter turnout dropped 
by 4 percent, while the rest 
of the state’s turnout went 
up by 3 percent. Winning 
back these states is in reach 
for the Democrats, but they 
have to inspire voter turnout. 
As former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton showed, it’s 
hard to inspire the politically 
diverse 
constituency 
of 
potential Democratic voters 
to turn out and vote, leading 
to a 20-year low in 2016.
It’s hard to say exactly how 
the loss could’ve been avoided, 
but 
Sen. 
Bernie 
Sanders, 
I-Vt.,’s primary wins in the 
Rust Belt could’ve been the 
canary in the coal mine for the 
loss in 2016. Sanders appealed 
to voters by promising the 
same things Trump did — 
economic 
security 
in 
an 
increasingly unequal world. It 
shows that it’s not impossible 

to gain support for left-
leaning policies in the more 
rural and industrial areas 
of the country. Bernie is 
again trying to appeal to the 
Rust Belt with policies that 
promise better conditions and 
combat economic inequality. 
The unfortunate reality of 
the situation, which many of 
the current Democrats fail to 
recognize, lies in the growing 
disparity between the haves 
and have-nots. Demagogues 
like Trump will utilize the 
inherent 
uncertainty 
and 
fear of job loss and declining 
conditions to gain support, 
and inevitably worsen the 
conditions they said they 
would combat.
The hypothetical situation 
of a competent candidate 
armed with the gaslighting 
techniques the Republicans 
learned over Trump’s first 
term is a scary one. Lying 
and fearmongering are now 
common in the Republican 
party. Trump’s brazen lies 
to the American people to 
inspire confidence would be 
much more pernicious and 
believable if they weren’t 
undermined 
by 
his 
less-
than-stellar 
public 
image. 
Regardless 
of 
whether 
Trump is removed or not, the 
situation of a fearmongering 
Republican 
candidate 
appears more and more likely.
As I’m sure most of us know, 
President Donald Trump was 
formally impeached by the 
House of Representatives this 
December, which leaves the 
process in limbo with regard 
to his trial for removal. It’s 
unclear when the trial will 
actually happen, as Senate 
members 
are 
seemingly 
reluctant to proceed with the 
trial. Removal seems unlikely, 
with a supermajority needed 
with a reluctant GOP, but that 
doesn’t mean it’s completely 
implausible. 
Whether 
the 
competent candidate be Vice 
President 
Mike 
Pence 
or 
someone else in the future, 
things will end poorly. What 
comes after Trump is just as 
important as what to do with 
him now, and that foresight 
is being lost in the whirlwind 
that is the 2020 election. 
Unless 
we 
want 
another 
fearmongering despot to rise 
to power, we must recognize 
the problem and fix it before 
it’s too late.

It is easy to feel powerless 
in 
the 
aftermath 
of 
new 
sweeping 
regulations 
from 
a 
large 
international 
organization such as the IOC. 
As the IOC is an independent 
non-profit 
organization, 
there is no law, international 
or otherwise, that prevents 
the Committee from creating 
and 
maintaining 
Rule 
50. 
But protest has been and will 
always be about confronting 
institutional 
structures, 
pushing 
against 
legal 
and 
social boundaries and refusing 
to be silenced. We encourage 
athletes who have the means 
and the security to do so to 
speak up for the issues they 
believe in, and we encourage 
the audience watching the 
Olympics to be aware of the 
risks these athletes are facing 
in order to speak up. 
First, 
Rule 
50 
has 
particularly 
troublesome 
implications. The new rule 
appears as a small limitation 
for athletes; after all, the 
regulation 
clarifies 
that 
protest or discourse of any 
sort can happen away from the 
medals ceremonies and the 
athletic 
events 
themselves. 
Athletes can still post on 
their Instagrams or speak 
openly at their post-event 
press conferences. But the 
presentation of medals at the 
Olympics is far too large of 
a cultural symbol to dismiss 
Rule 50 as a small tweak to 
existing athletic regulations.
The medals presentation 
is an iconic athletic ceremony 
that captures the attention 
of the public. From Tommie 
Smith 
and 
John 
Carlos’s 
Black 
power 
protest 
at 
the 1968 Olympics to Race 
Imboden’s kneeling at the 
2019 Pan American Games, 
the medal podium has been 
a crucial locus for protest 
from passionate and talented 
athletes. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Olympics draw in massive 
audiences to create a sort of 
international 
town 
square 
where people from all over the 
world discuss their ideas and 
values. As such, the Olympics 
create an attractive platform 
for protesters. When someone 
receives a medal, the world 
is watching, and it’s the most 

advantageous 
time 
for 
an 
athlete to publically espouse 
their beliefs. The Olympics 
are 
essentially 
allowing 
people to voice their opinions, 
but only in the spaces where 
these 
opinions 
would 
not 
garner attention.
The Olympics have always 
been 
political. 
In 
Ancient 
Greece, they were a way for 
political leaders of different 
city-states 
to 
gather 
and 
have discussions on political 
matters regularly. Pierre de 
Coubertin, the founder of the 
modern Olympics, once said 
the games served not only the 
purpose of uniting countries 
through sports, but also of 
bringing humanity together 
and striving for a better world. 
Based on the founding idea 
and modern philosophy of 
the games, the Olympics have 
been one of the biggest stages 
for athletes to protest based 
on their beliefs. Despite the 
IOC’s 
ambiguously 
worded 
effort in Rule 50 to stay as 
apolitical 
as 
possible, 
the 
Olympics have seen numerous 
meaningful protests since the 

first modern games in 1894.
In addition to the tradition 
of prevalent protests during 
the games, the IOC itself 
has proved to the world time 
and time again how it can be 
blatantly political when it 
helps its case. The IOC chose 
to still invite Russian athletes 
to the 2018 Olympics even 
after the scandal of state-
sponsored 
doping 
schemes 
during the Sochi Games in 
2014. When South and North 
Korea decided to field a unified 
team for the Pyeongchang 
Games in 2018, IOC president 
Thomas Bach evidently saw an 
opportunity to take a stance 
in easing the tension in the 

Korean peninsula and openly 
welcomed 
the 
decision, 
even stating the games were 
“hopefully opening the door 
to a bright future on the 
Korean peninsula.” Given the 
precedent of past protests and 
the IOC being intentionally 
political on other occasions, 
it 
seems 
as 
though 
the 
Committee 
wants 
to 
take 
control over what kind of 
politics can be present during 
the Olympics and ended up 
banning 
any 
protests 
for 
which they could be seen 
responsible. 
The IOC’s new rule bans 
free 
expression. 
Protests 
function 
as 
a 
way 
for 
individuals 
or 
groups 
to 
express concern toward the 
status quo, so protestors are 
bound to oppose the existing 
regulations 
by 
nature. 
Protests must be public to 
serve the purpose of getting 
the intended message across 
to as many people as possible 
and bringing about change. 
Rule 50 does not completely 
ban all protests. In that sense, 
the new rule does not sound 
terribly oppressive. However, 
the rule limits where protests 
can and cannot take place 
and consequently bans free 
expression as free expression 
itself should have no limits. 
Controlling where protests can 
or cannot happen takes away 
the public and deliberately 
anti-establishment 
aspects 
of 
such 
demonstrations, 
defeating their purpose. 
Maybe it was the IOC’s 
goal to ban the free expression 
of athletes. Maybe the IOC 
simply did not want to be 
responsible for whatever the 
athletes could say or do with 
political 
aim. 
Either 
way, 
it is clear that the new rule 
decided by the Committee is 
poorly stated and misguided. 
Athletes may protest during 
the 
games 
this 
summer 
anyway. Some might even be 
more motivated to speak up 
for their cause because of the 
new rule. As spectators, we 
support the athletes and their 
protests as long as they are 
not 
destructive. 
Promoting 
inclusivity and peace on one 
of the biggest international 
stages should be a noble cause, 

FROM THE DAILY

The Olympic’s misguided crackdown on activism
A

s athletes compete at the highest caliber in Tokyo, Japan later this year, their 

actions and words will be watched more closely than ever thanks to new 

regulations from the Olympics’ organizing body. The International Olympic 

Committee (IOC) has recently come under fire for issuing Rule 50, a ban on protests on 

the field, on the podium, at Olympic ceremonies and in the Olympic Village. Athletes are 

still allowed to express their views in press conferences, in team meetings and on social 

media. This rule comes after heightened political statements and attention on world 

sports stages from athletes like Colin Kaepernick, Feyisa Lilesa and Sarah Lee Wai-sze.

The IOC’s new 
rule bans free 
expression.

What comes 
after Trump is 
just as important 
as what to do 
with him now.

It’s a Saturday night in the 
middle 
of 
nowhere. 
You’re 
driving down a dirt road (in 
a 
pickup 
truck, 
obviously) 
and 
passing 
cornfield 
after 
cornfield. 
Eventually 
you 
reach a massive bonfire where 
attractive young people are 
gathered. Tailgates are down. 
Speakers 
are 
turned 
up. 
Everyone is drinking. 
It’s a common image in 
popular contemporary country 
music. 
The 
light-hearted, 
quasi-romantic night in the 
backwoods. One that Little Big 
Town turns on its head in the 
group’s latest release Nightfall.
“I’d paint a river of stars 
for you / Cross the ocean of 
a sapphire blue” lead singer 
Karen Fairchild claims on the 
cinematic 
“River 
of 
Stars.” 
Other 
tracks 
don’t 
detail 
landscapes so explicitly, but 
all of Nightfall exists in this 
starry, inky blue atmosphere. 
“Next to You” and the title 
track glow with the kind of 
vulnerability 
that 
can 
only 
come out in the dark. And while 
the band has fun on songs like 
“Over Drinking” and “Wine, 
Beer, 
Whiskey,” 
it’s 
obvious 
throughout Nightfall that Little 
Big Town’s nights are largely 
long, quiet and contemplative. 
Nightfall 
is 
constructed 
to give the group’s strong 
harmonies the space to shine. 
Stripped-back 
instrumentals 
tend to build into bridges that 
burst 
into 
sparkling 
group 
revelations — like the moment 

you’ve been staring at the sky 
just long enough to shiver. Still, 
Little 
Big 
Town 
recognizes 
that our haunting, late night 
thoughts 
aren’t 
always 
so 
syrupy. In fact, they oftentimes 
sting. 
On “The Daughters” Fairchild 
challenges commonly-held beliefs 
without blinking. “I’ve heard 
of God the son and God the 

Father / I’m just looking for 
a God for the daughters” she 
sings. 
Songs 
like 
“Problem 
Child” and “Questions” explore 
the feelings of self-doubt and 
insecurity that tend to lurk 
in the early morning hours, 
whether they be about one’s 
identity or a past relationship.
The standout “Sugar Coat” is 

equal parts clever and gutting. 
A woman’s tendency to gloss 
over the ugliness in her life, 
like her husband’s infidelity, 
is made physical. The coat was 
“passed down” from her mom 
and Fairchild’s voice soars as 
she ends up wishing she could 
take it off. 
The atmosphere of Nightfall 
is a walk in the woods miles 
away from a corn field, bonfire 
bash. 
But 
Little 
Big 
Town 
has never been a stranger 
to wandering off the beaten 
path. In 2015, the band had 
their 
biggest 
crossover 
hit 
to date with “Girl Crush,” a 
love letter between women … 
about a man. In 2016, the group 
released the Pharell Williams-
produced 
Wanderlust. 
The 
group’s 
composition 
itself 
is noteworthy — very few 
successful country groups are 
fronted by women and even 
less by women over 40.
What’s 
most 
remarkable 
about Nightfall then, is that it 
finds Little Big Town as clear-
headed and wide-eyed as ever. 
Nightfall proves their staying 
power. 
Despite, 
or 
maybe 
because of, their wandering 
and “against the odds” makeup 
as a band, Little Big Town is 
triumphant 
on 
their 
ninth 
studio 
album, 
something 
artists in any genre are lucky 
to claim. 
Boasting 
a 
sound 
that’s 
funky and dark, simultaneously 
sleek and earthy, Little Big 
Town has never been very 
concerned with proving their 
country 
cred. 
Nonetheless, 
they’ve managed to make their 
own lane in the genre. It isn’t 
a dirt road, but it still has a 
worthwhile view.

Over the last year, critically-
acclaimed shows such as “The 
Act,” 
“Unbelievable” 
and 
the 
recently 
released 
Aaron 
Hernandez 
mini-series 
“Killer 
Inside” 
represent 
America’s 
newfound fascination with the 
true-crime 
genre. 
Similarly, 
the popularity of shows such as 
“Black 
Mirror” 
and 
“Stranger 
Things” reveals the expanding 
market for horror. All factors 
considered, it was only a matter 
of time before the genres of 
horror, 
crime 
and 
mystery 
melded together on HBO to give 
us “The Outsider,” the televised 
adaptation of the Stephen King 
novel of the same name.
Georgia 
detective 
Ralph 
Anderson 
(Ben 
Mendelsohn, 
“Ready Player One”) is called to 
investigate the most horrifying 
case he will probably ever work 
on — the violent death of a child 
named Frankie Peterson, who has 
been deformed in unimaginable 
ways. As any person would react 
in this situation, he rushes to find 
a way to get the monster that did 
this off the streets and to deliver 

vindication 
to 
a 
community 
rattled by this unthinkable crime. 
Several 
reliable 
witnesses 
identify 
Terry 
Maitland 

(Jason 
Bateman, 
“Arrested 
Development”), 
a 
universally-
liked local, as a suspect. A 

seemingly normal youth baseball 
coach, 
no 
one 
can 
imagine 
Maitland 
committing 
such 
a 
crime. However, the evidence 
points to another conclusion: A 
woman saw him helping Frankie 
into his van, a kid saw him 
come out of the woods with 
blood all around his face and 
he was spotted all over the area 
on security cameras. He even 
called a cab and made sure it 
was recorded. It’s almost as 
though Terry wanted to be 
seen.
Encouraged by the District 
Attorney Bill Samuels (Michael 
Esper, 
“Ray 
Donovan”), 
Anderson publicly arrests Terry 
at 
a 
Little 
League 
baseball 
game. Without DNA evidence 
nor questioning, the police have 
publicly condemned Maitland 
as a child murderer. But, despite 
the 
overwhelming 
physical 
evidence that points to Terry 
being at the scene of Frankie’s 
death, there is video evidence 
that proves he was dozens 
of miles away at a literary 
conference at the exact same 
time of the murder. How can he 
be two places at once? 
It’s 
impossible 
to 
blame 
Anderson for his decision to 
implicate 
Maitland, 
however, 

the show makes it clear that 

sometimes, the easy answer is 
not always the right answer. 

The show also allows viewers to 
question 
Anderson’s 
integrity: 
Is his hasty push 
towards 
justice 
derived out of a 
concern 
for 
the 
community, 
or 
rather just a means 
to vindicate the loss 
of his own son, who 
died at a young age? 
Fans of the book 
might 
be 
slightly 
disappointed 
that 
the first 170 pages 
of 
the 
novel 
are 
rushed through at 
a 
breakneck 
pace 
in 
the 
pilot, 
but 
executive 
producer 
Jason Bateman is clearly more 

interested in the action of the 
aftermath than the foreplay 
of the set-up. 
It’s 
hard 
to 
argue 
with 
this rationale, 
as the hook is 
good enough to 
distract 
from 
the sometimes 
dizzying 
pace 
of the show. By 
propelling 
us 
forward 
into 
the center of 
the 
narrative, 
“The Outsider” 
makes us more 
engaged than 
we would be if 
the show had taken its time. 

Sometimes, 
the easy 
answer is not 
always the 
right answer.

JUSTIN POLLACK
Daily Arts Writer

The French-Canadian author 
Stéphane Larue has worked in 
the restaurant industry for most 
of his adult life — he’s now the 
part-owner of a bar in Montreal. 
In an interview, he described 
the progress of his career in the 
kitchen: 
“Dishwasher, 
kitchen 
helper. Then into the dining 
room: busboy, waiter, maitre-d’, 
manager.” Later in the same 
interview he comments that “the 
dishwasher sees everything, like 
a fly on the wall.” 
This easy familiarity with the 
lives of kitchen workers is clear in 
the pages of Larue’s debut novel, 
“The Dishwasher,” which was 
recently translated into English 
by Pablo Strauss. His novel places 
us in the teeming underside of 
nightlife in Montreal, peopled 
with 
the 
restaurant 
workers, 
bartenders 
and 
bussers 
that 
make it possible. His unnamed 
protagonist enters this world 
mostly 
out 
of 
desperation: 
after 
months 
of 
succumbing 
to his gambling addiction, he 
has exhausted his savings and 
the patience of his friends — 
Larue based his writing about 
gambling addiction on his own 
experiences, and so he depicts 
it with bracing intimacy. His 
exasperated cousin Malik loans 
him eighty dollars and gives 
him a lead on a job at a high-end 
restaurant, 
work 
that 
proves 
both punishing and rewarding, 
and begins, slowly and haltingly, 
to 
lift 
him 
from 
his 
initial 
pathetic condition. 
Larue writes in an unusually 
direct, immersive way, generally 
avoiding 
expository 
writing. 
He instead prefers to describe 
more or less every moment of 
his protagonist’s life for the first 
few weeks at his job. Nothing is 
skipped or bypassed; we nearly 
get to the level of seeing every 
dropped dish and scrubbed pan. 
His style feels exhaustive: each 
detail needs to be explained, 
itemized 
and 
followed 
to 
conclusions. This is especially 
apparent in the extended scenes 
of kitchen work early on in the 
book. To pick an example at 
random: 
“From that moment on I 
tried desperately to keep up as 
Bébert listed off the thousand-
and-one things I had to do. He 
tossed ten bags of spinach onto 
the stainless prep counter. My 
job was to pull off the stems 
and throw out any rotten bits. 

He came back out of the walk-
in with two waxed cardboard 
boxes which he threw at the 
foot of the sink. I was to pick 
out twenty heads of romaine, 
and forty heads of leaf lettuce, 
pull off the leaves, wash them in 
ice-cold water, then dry them in 
an unwieldy salad spinner that I 
had to hold against my body as I 
turned.” 
It continues in this fashion 
for nearly fifteen pages. This 
description is both utilitarian 
(forty 
heads 
of 
leaf 
lettuce 
versus twenty heads of romaine, 
don’t 
make 
a 
mistake) 
and 
physical, 
sensory 
(“ice-cold” 
water, the salad spinner that has 
to be embraced). Larue seems 
intent on putting the reader 
into the head of his protagonist, 
making 
the 
reader 
inhabit 
the stress of the kitchen. This 
style is definitely an acquired 
taste. The plot is so tightly 
wound, 
so 
furiously 
coupled 
to the materials of existence, 
that 
it 
is 
both 
invigorating 
and exhausting to read. The 
intensity and detail of Larue’s 
writing 
feels 
appropriate 
for 
what he’s trying to convey about 
his subject, and it works well in 

bringing his world to life. 
Rhythms 
start 
to 
emerge 
from this dense texture. The 
restaurant workers do grueling, 
difficult, fast-paced work night 
after night and then usually go 
to an after-hours bar to exhaust 
the remainder of their energy. 
The scenes in dimly lit dives 
are hazy and confusing, largely 
taken up by the protagonist 
struggling to understand what’s 
going on while eyeing the video 
lottery machines in the corner. 
These wild nights out become 
basically another method for the 
protagonist to distract himself 
from the thought of gambling, 
one that only sometimes works. 
He never really becomes a hero, 
and no one thing can necessarily 
keep him away from his vice. We 

instead get the sense of someone 
buffeted around by forces largely 
outside of his control, remaining 
at the mercy of his own desires 
and fixations.
To that end, Larue has a 
certain 
attention 
toward 
the 
surrender 
and 
decreation 
inherent in this lifestyle. The 
life 
of 
a 
restaurant 
worker 
starts to feel centrifugal and 
self-similar — hedonism erases 
frantic 
industriousness 
and 
vice versa. Work and play share 
a potential for dissociation, for 
a kind of destructive flow. The 
point is driven home by the 
protagonist’s taste in music — 
there’s a depiction of a metal 
concert that feels representative 
of the relationality that this book 
pursues. “She jumped into the 
melee, climbed over the swirl of 
bodies smashing into each other, 
then let herself be swept along 
by the crowd, tumbling over the 
human sea all the way to the foot 
of the stage.” Gambling feels like 
this, too: the narrator describes 
the “electric shocks” he feels 
when he’s tempted to relapse 
and the “euphoria” of winning. 
The 
protagonist 
thrives 
on 
momentum, and by the end of 
the book you can tell that he’s 
well-suited for the restaurant 
industry 
mostly 
because 
he 
needs to feel that “euphoria” in 
one way or another. 
As 
you 
might 
expect, 
Larue 
neither 
denigrates 
or 
romanticizes 
this 
life. 
The 
cooks 
and 
dishwashers 
have 
embarrassing, 
unromantic 
ailments: 
bad 
backs, 
limps, 
eczema, rosacea. They sweat over 
hot stoves, they cut themselves 
badly, they are too exhausted or 
hungover to function correctly. 
One can clearly see how burnout 
works in this world, how easy 
it would be to suddenly find 
oneself too spent to continue. 
There are moments, however 
fleeting, of solidarity — at one 
point the sous-chef looks at the 
protagonist after a particularly 
difficult moment “as if he had 
all the time in the world,” and 
there’s another moment where 
the protagonist’s coworkers fend 
off an assailant in a bar.
The novel is generous to its 
subject and on balance ends 
up 
feeling 
compassionate 
underneath 
the 
intensity 
of 
its surfaces. It never feels like 
Larue wants to condemn or exalt 
any aspect of this world, instead 
seeking synthesis — resilience 
becomes the desperate material 
of life rather than a palliative; 
hope and struggle feed off each 
other.

In the first ten minutes of 
“Clue,” writer Jonathan Flynn 
(“My Cousin Vinny”) tells you 
exactly what kind of movie 
you’re in for. As Miss Scarlet 
(Lesley Ann Warren, “Victor/
Victoria”) and Professor Plum 
(Christopher Lloyd, “Back to 
the Future”) drive up to the 
mysterious mansion that serves 
as the setting for the story, their 
car stops near the gate. After 
a dramatic flash of lightning, 
Miss Scarlet asks, “Why has the 
car stopped?” “It’s frightened,” 
whispers 
Professor 
Plum. 
Jokes like these demonstrate 
that 
“Clue” 
is 
not 
only 
a 
whodunit mystery, but a film 
that is eccentric, cheesy and an 
overall delightful experience.
When 
“Clue” 
was 
first 
released theatrically in 1985, 
I have to assume that people 
were confused. Why, one might 
ask, would someone take a 
board game with no distinct 
plot and turn it into a movie? 
In the number of times I have 
played a game of Clue, I have 
never thought, “Man I wish 

this board game had a full-
length feature film based on 
it.” Yet, such a film exists and 
has entertained, as well as 
perplexed audiences for 35 
years.
Every time I watch “Clue,” I 

find it funnier than the last time 
I watched it, as I pick up on the 
crass jokes that went over my 
head when I was younger. For 
this reason, I was excited to see 
that the Michigan Theater was 

showing “Clue” as part of their 
“Whodunnit 
Wednesdays” 
series this month.
The 
film’s 
premise 
stays 
true to the game, including 
the same six main characters: 
Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard 
(Martin Mull, “Mary Hartman, 
Mary Hartman”), Mrs. White 
(Madeline 
Kahn, 
“Young 
Frankenstein”), 
Professor 
Plum, 
Mrs. 
Peacock 
(Eileen 
Brennen, 
“Private 
Benjamin”) 
and 
Mr. 
Green 
(Michael 
McKean, “This Is Spinal Tap”). 
A semblance of plot is added 
through additional characters, 
specifically 
Mr. 
Boddy 
(Lee 
Ving, 
“Flashdance”) 
who 
blackmails each character with 
sensitive 
information, 
and 
Wadsworth (Tim Curry, “The 
Rocky Horror Picture Show”), 
the 
archetypal 
butler, 
who 
brings the group together with 
the intention of exposing Mr. 
Boddy’s scheme. 
Due to the limiting nature 
of the source material, the plot 
feels forced at times, filled 
with heavy-handed attempts to 
remind you that, yes, this movie 
was based on a board game. 
For example, when Mr. Boddy 
hands each character one of 
the iconic weapons from the 

game (a rope, a wrench, a lead 
pipe, a revolver, a candlestick 
and a knife), we shouldn’t be 
surprised that he is almost 
immediately murdered.
Beyond 
the 
somewhat 
ludicrous 
plotline, 
there 
are a number of redeeming 
qualities 
that 
make 
“Clue” 
truly enjoyable. The all-star 
cast, for example, does an 
excellent job using the witty 
dialogue to their advantage 
— Curry in particular, whose 
rapid-fire 
recreation 
of 
the 
night’s events near the end 
of the film is an incredibly 
funny sequence that is made 
all the better by the comical 
music accompanying the scene. 
Another is the costumes — 
Miss Scarlet’s dramatic coat 
and Mrs. Peacock’s bejeweled 
cat-eye glasses add a touch of 
extravagance and flair to the 
film.
The real star of the film, 
however, is its wit and dark 
humor. There’s a reason “Clue” 
has been a cult classic for so 
long: It follows the typical 
“Whodunnit” 
format 
while 
filling 
the 
time 
between 
murders with physical gags, 
clever 
quips 
and 
satirical 
subversions of the genre. If 
“Clue” ignored the oddness 

of its premise, it would have 
been a movie that took itself 
too seriously; instead, “Clue” 
embraces everything that is 
weird about it, and the effect is 
delightful.

FILM NOTEBOOK
FILM NOTEBOOK

PARAMOUNT PICTURES

When I was in middle school, 
my introduction to music was 
the Indie Rock Radio station on 
Pandora. Up until that point, I 
didn’t really put much effort 
into finding new music to listen 
to. I was either listening to 
South Florida’s Number One 
Classic Rock Station, 98.7 FM 
- The Gator, or a compilation 
of greatest hits CDs that my 
parents 
had 
accumulated 
throughout the years. When I 
first learned about this thing 
called indie music, I didn’t really 
know exactly what the word 
‘indie’ meant. I interpreted it to 
simply mean less well-known, 
or something along those lines. 
It wouldn’t be for another few 
years when I heard the word 
used in front of other art forms, 
like films and games, that I 
would decide to look into the 
actual meaning of the word.
When you google the word 
‘indie,’ the search engine politely 
tells you that the word, when 
used as an adjective, means 
“not belonging to or affiliated 
with a major record or film 
company.” When I first heard 
this 
definition, 
I 
interpreted 
it to mean something similar 
to what I now interpret DIY to 
mean: independent. I thought 
of albums put out by bands that 
were only able to afford making 
the album after playing at their 
local bar dozens of times, or 
maybe a small group of friends 
helping out a community of 
bands that they like in order 
to promote and produce their 
music. 
But 
later, 
I 
started 
to 
notice that this definition was 
changing a bit. When I found 
an older playlist put out by 
Spotify of the top indie tracks 
in 2015, I was a bit confused. 
There 
were 
tracks 
put 
out 

by bands that were signed to 
multi-million 
dollar 
record 
companies, which to me seemed 
to go against the meaning of the 
word indie entirely. Don’t get 
me wrong, I’m not dismissing 
the quality of that music at 
all — Sufjan Stevens, an artist 
that 
I 
greatly 
admire, 
was 
pretty high up on that playlist. 
It simply seems as though the 
word indie has shifted from 
referring to an independent 
project to becoming a synonym 
for alternative. Indie rock now 
seems more like an offshoot of 
alternative rock. 
And now, it seems like this is 
starting to happen, albeit slowly, 
with the word DIY. Thankfully, 
I haven’t heard of any band 
signed to a record label that 
began as a twenty million dollar 
joint venture being referred to 
as a DIY band. However, more 
and more each day, it seems like 
the adjective is thrown around 
to describe the sound of bands 
instead 
of 
the 
background 
of those bands. Bands with 
a lofi, alternative sound are 
increasingly being referred to 
as DIY bands, regardless of 
how much of the work they’re 
actually doing themselves. 
I’m 
not 
trying 
to 
be 
a 
gatekeeper of the word DIY 
— I truly want as many people 
as possible to be aware and 
involved in the DIY community. 
I don’t want to pretend to be 
some sort of authority on what 
is and isn’t DIY. I absolutely 
don’t have the experience or 
knowledge to make that claim, 
and I don’t believe any one 
individual does. What I do 
know for certain is that this 
community is important. The 
passion 
that 
runs 
through 
the DIY community is truly 
inspiring and is something I 
hope everyone gets a chance to 
experience. I just don’t want 
DIY to be known for anything 
besides that passion.

Pacific breeze

Michigan sweeps through West Coast trip, beating Washington on Friday and Oregon on Saturday

After a disappointing loss 
in its season opener to No. 23 
North Carolina State, the No. 
17 Michigan men’s tennis team 
(2-1) headed to the Pacific 
Northwest in search of its first 
win of the season. The team 
bounced 
back 
in 
dominant 
fashion, notching wins over 
a pair of undefeated Pac-12 
opponents.
Last Friday, Michigan blew 
the doors off a then-undefeated 
Washington (2-1) team, going 
6-0 in singles matches and 2-0 
in doubles. Just two days later, 
the Wolverines headed south 
to face off against Oregon (3-1), 
and once again won the match 
decidedly, winning four of six 
singles matches as well as both 
doubles matches.
In an effort to prevent a 
repeat of the team’s opener, 
the Wolverines’ underclassmen 

stepped up, with sophomore 
Andrew 
Fenty 
and 
true 
freshman 
Ondrej 
Styler 
combining 
4-0 
against 
the 
Huskies, winning a singles and 
doubles match apiece.
Notable was the team’s sweep 
in 
doubles 
matches, 
which 
have emerged as Michigan’s 
strength. 
The 
combination 
of Fenty and junior Mattias 
Siimar is 3-0 this season and 
is currently the fifth-ranked 
doubles team in the country, 
giving the Wolverines a big edge 
in the doubles game. Michigan 
has won the doubles point in 
all three of its regular season 
matches this season, and twice 
clinched the point early.
“It all stems from our energy 
in doubles,” Michigan coach 
Adam Steinberg said. “I thought 
we played really well both days 
and that set the tone for us. 
We came out, won the doubles 
point, got up in some matches 
in singles and started feeling 

comfortable. 
That’s 
what 
happened in Washington.”
The team’s usual dominance 
in 
the 
doubles 
game 
was 
accompanied by an especially 
strong 
singles 
performance. 
Five of the six singles matches 
were won in straight sets, 
with Nick Beaty taking care 
of business with a 6-2, 6-1 
performance. 
With the strength of their 
doubles team and a wealth of 
experience, a return to the 
NCAA tournament for the fifth 
straight year seems likely given 
the wealth of young talent 
the Wolverines have at their 
disposal. 
There’s Fenty, who had one 
of the best freshman seasons in 
Michigan tennis history. The 
Washington, D.C.-native took 
home the ITA Freshman of the 
Year and Big Ten Freshman of 
Year awards, was voted First-
Team All-Big Ten and compiled 
a 27-7 record in singles play. 
Then 
there’s 
Styler, 
the 
team’s only freshman. Hailing 
from the Czech Republic, Styler 
was a force on the junior circuit, 
reaching a No. 13 world ranking 
and winning the Junior French 
Open. While the transition 
from junior tennis to the college 
level is always difficult, Styler 
appears to be transitioning into 
the game right in time for the 
Wolverines’ regular season.
Looking ahead, the team will 
look to build on the momentum 
from the two wins, heading to 
the ITA Kick-off Tournament 
next weekend, where they look 
to potentially face off against 
No. 13 Illinois in a preview of 
what could be an important 
conference matchup down the 
road. 
“The guys responded really 
well on the road,” Steinberg 
said. “These are two very tough 
teams, and coming off a loss it’s 
not easy. Especially with the 
schedule we have, it’s tough 
every single match, so I know 
how big it was that we won at 
Washington and then had a 
great win yesterday against 
Oregon.”

Eugene 
was 
unfamiliar 
territory to the Wolverines on 
their first away trip of the spring 
season 
for 
Sunday’s 
match 
against Oregon. Nonetheless 
the No. 17 Michigan men’s 
tennis team (2-1) took on their 
new opponent in stride with 
a 5-2 win in both singles and 
doubles.
The 
Wolverines’ 
West 
Coast trip proved to be a 
successful one on the heels of 
a tough loss at home to North 
Carolina State last week, with 
another dominant 7-0 win over 
Washington on Friday. 
“These are Pac-12 teams 
with a tough schedule and 
they’re used to playing top 
teams,” Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg said. “So we knew 
they were going to make a run, 
but we withstood it and it was a 
great win.”
The Wolverines’ two doubles 
pairs made quick work of the 
Ducks, who were the highest-
ranked 
doubles 
opposition 
they’ve faced this season. After 
an initial 4-0 run, the duo of 
sophomore Andrew Fenty and 
junior Mattias Siimar withstood 
a four-point Oregon comeback 
to ultimately come away with 
a 6-4 win. In the second set, 
freshman Ondrej Styler and 
senior Connor Johnston were 
tied with Oregon before taking 
the 
last 
three 
games 
and 
securing the win, guaranteeing 
Michigan the doubles point.
“Having a great team stems 
from having great doubles,” 
Steinberg said. “So especially 
on the road, to get the doubles 
point was a big lift for us.”
Singles play was more mixed. 
Styler, still new to the college 
tennis circuit, put on a confident 
performance against Oregon’s 
Emmanuel Coste with wins in 
two straight sets. Senior Nick 
Beaty brought the Wolverines’ 
lead 
to 
3-0 
with 
another 
straight-sets victory over Luke 
Vandecasteele. Mattias Siimar 
won both sets as well to solidify 

Michigan’s 
singles’ 
victory. 
Juniors Harrison Brown and 
Kristofer Siimar ultimately fell 
to Oregon after dominant wins 
in their first sets. 
“I’m glad we won all six 
first sets in singles but then we 
let 
them 
back 
in, 
which 
is 
something 
we 
have to work on,” 
Steinberg 
said. 
“If 
there 
was 
one negative, it’s 
that we have to 
work on keeping 
our foot on the 
gas like I know 
we’re capable of 
doing.”
Steinberg was 
particularly impressed by Styler 
and 
Beaty’s 
performances, 
given how little they’ve played 
this season. 
“Ondrej had a great weekend 
and his wins were a big lift for us 
in terms of his spirit as well as 

getting used to playing college 
tennis,” Steinberg said. “Beaty 
really stood out as well with his 
win, and given he hasn’t played 
as much in his college career so 
it was great to see.”
Given Michigan has never 
played 
at 
Oregon 
before 
as well as the 
difficult 
time 
they had against 
the 
Wolfpack 
last 
week, 
Steinberg found 
this win to be 
particularly 
uplifting.
“I 
think 
it 
challenged the 
team 
to 
start 
the schedule like this, going 
out west to play in these tough 
environments in a place we’ve 
never been before,” Steinberg 
said. “So I think it got us 
much more match-ready going 
forward.”

Upperclassmen stepping up and making an impact for Wolverines

The seniors were chatting at 
the back of the bus.
Last weekend, the flight to 
State College didn’t go exactly 
as planned. It got redirected 
to Harrisburg, Penn., and from 
there the Michigan hockey 
team had to bus two hours to 
its rightful destination of State 
College.
While the Wolverines were 
en 
route, 
the 
seniors all sat 
together in the 
last 
rows 
and 
talked 
about 
their 
play. 
Defensively, 
they had things 
locked 
down. 
Offensively, they 
had to find a 
spark.
“We’re 
like 
‘Oh, all we need is just kind of 
start clicking on offense, and 
we’ll start taking off,’ ” senior 
forward Nick Pastujov said.
Eleven goals were scored over 
two games against Penn State — 
leading to a 6-0 win Friday, and 
a 4-4 tie and double-overtime 
win Saturday. Seniors accounted 
for four of those goals. They had 
pieced it together. In addition 
to scoring, they 
accounted 
for 
five 
assists. 
The 
seniors 
had ignited the 
offense.
“Some 
of 
the 
younger 
guys 
are 
still 
overperforming 
and playing really 
well,” 
senior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood said. “But it’s nice to 
see some of the leadership from 
some older guys step in and you 
know, get some credit on this.”
It was a crucial component 
the team felt had been missing 
all year.
After the onslaught of goals, 

the seniors looked at each other 
and said: “Hey, we kind of 
called it.”
It was a big turnaround from 
the 
early 
scoring 
struggles 
Michigan faced in the first half 
of the year. But in the second 
half the team — seniors in 
particular — have come with a 
vengeance. 
Entering the season, there 
were 
certain 
expectations 
for the upperclassmen. Their 
leadership role wasn’t meant 
to be exclusively 
vocal. 
They 
needed 
to 
demonstrate 
it in their play 
too. And while 
they 
seemingly 
succeeded in the 
former, the latter 
was 
a 
glaring 
issue. They just 
couldn’t convert.
“I think it’s 
good that we’re finally starting 
to click and put up points,” 
Pastujov said on the seniors. “... 
It’s huge that once we started 
clicking offensively, especially 
just the way that Penn State 
(and) Notre Dame played where 
if we just keep rolling over on 
them in their own zone, they 
just can’t sustain the same way 
that we can.”
It 
was 
a 
dominant 
performance 
that led the way 
to more than 
just wins. 
For 
the 
upperclassmen 
to take charge, 
pave 
a 
lead 
and ultimately 
win the game, 
it showed the 
younger players the template 
for what the Wolverines are 
capable of doing. Sometimes, 
all it takes is seeing that it’s 
possible before believing that 
it can be done on a consistent 
basis.
“I think with us to have that 

hot start I think it did lead into 
like, other guys because even the 
second game, like Granowicz 
was scoring, Beecher scoring,” 
Pastujov said on seniors leading 
by example. “Lot of these young 
guys kind of get the confidence 
that next game, where, ‘Yeah, 
they are Penn State. Yeah, they 
are sixth, but yeah, we can roll 
over on them. We can also play 
with them and kind of dominate 
them.’
“So I think that’s what helped 
us that second game, kind of 
stay in the game and keep that 
confidence up where no one was 
ever really doubting whether 
we’d come away with the win.”
It 
was 
senior 
forward 
Jake Slaker that opened the 
floodgates with a snipe from a 
left-side rush Friday. Pastujov 
followed suit. And then the 
younger players took charge — 
much to the upperclassmen’s 

relief.
The seniors aren’t necessarily 
burdened by the stigma that 
they should be scoring, but the 
assumption can bear down on 
them at times. 
“Even 
as 
an 
older guy, where 
you kind of do 
feel that weight,” 
Lockwood 
said. “And that 
pressure of okay 
we got to be the 
ones that score. 
Just having those 
guys 
score 
is 
huge. Seeing that 
confidence that they get from 
it.”
It’s lead by example, and 
when the younger players do 
find success, it’s just as exciting 
for the seniors as it is to them. 
For the upperclassmen, it was 
only a couple years ago that 

they were in those shoes.
“I 
remember 
when 
I 
was younger and I had my 
upperclassmen who had my 
back 
through 
tough 
times 
and then were 
there 
for 
me 
and 
excited 
for me when I 
had 
success,” 
Lockwood said. 
“And now I can 
flip roles and 
be the guy who 
is 
excited 
for 
another guy like 
Granowicz.”
Added Slaker: 
“Even thinking back to my 
sophomore year, seeing (Cooper 
Marody) and (Tony Calderone) 
and 
(Dexter 
Dancs), 
just 
consistently producing, gave 
you confidence that like, not 
necessarily, even if I don’t score 
they’ll score, but it’s like, ‘We 

can do it you know like they’re 
a team that we can be like, they 
can be beat pretty much,’ and so 
that’s huge to see as a young guy 
like coming up.”
Marody, 
Calderone 
and 
Dancs were the key players that 
manufactured 
a 
late-season 
run to the Frozen Four two 
years ago. What once was a 
showcase to the young Slaker, 
Lockwood, Pastujov and other 
then-underclassmen, 
is 
now 
a blueprint they’re aiming to 
follow.
In what has thus far been 
a tumultuous season for the 
Wolverines, 
their 
veteran 
core stepping up to contribute 
offense doesn’t only set an 
example 
for 
the 
younger 
players, but it can potentially 
set the stage for a second-half 
run. And through four games, 
that certainly seems to be the 
case.

Some of the

Robbins out with ACL

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team has lost a key 
player in senior forward Kayla 
Robbins, who announced via 
Twitter on Tuesday that she 
tore her ACL in Sunday’s game 
at Nebraska. 
“Unfortunately, 
I 
have 
suffered an ACL tear that will 
keep me out for the remainder 
of my senior season” Robbins 
said in a statement posted to 
Twitter. “As much as it pains 
me that I will never get to play 
in a Michigan jersey ever again, 
I know that God has a plan for 
me and my future. This season 
I have accomplished more than 
I ever thought I could with my 
teammates and wouldn’t trade 
it for the world. I have great 
teammates, coaches, and staff 
that have been there every 
step of the way since I’ve been 
a freshman and continue to 
support me. Injuries will test 
you physically and emotionally, 
but know that I am strong 
enough to undergo my road to 
recovery. I am ready to help 
and support my team as we 
finish out the season. This will 
not be the last time you hear 

my name be called. Forever, Go 
Blue!”
The Nebraska game was her 
last as a Wolverine, as it is too 
late in the season to qualify for 
a medical redshirt. 
Robbins 
was 
the 
team’s 
second-leading scorer, averaging 
11.6 points per game. Without 
her, Michigan will have a 
major hole to fill offensively. 
Her quick shooting release 
and agility off the dribble 
made her lethal when driving 
the lane and opened up space 
for 
teammates 
to 
create 
opportunities away from the 
hoop. She also provided a tough 
defensive presence, with eight 
blocks and a team-leading 29 
steals. 
In her first three seasons, 
Robbins 
was 
a 
consistent 
producer 
off 
the 
bench, 
appearing in at least 33 games 
each year. This season was her 
first as a starter. 
As one of just two seniors 
on the team, Robbins took on 
a leadership role this year, 
providing scoring when the 
team 
desperately 
needed 
it during droughts. But the 
Wolverines will need to look 
elsewhere for that stability for 
the remainder of the season.

Where Michigan goes without Kayla Robbins

From the first possession, senior 
forward Kayla Robbins wanted to 
make the game hers. Answering 
an early 3-pointer from Nebraska, 
she drove to the basket and drew 
a foul. Robbins made the first free-
throw and missed the second — 
but corralled her own offensive 
rebound.
The game plan Sunday was 
clear: Get the ball to Robbins. It 
worked, she was set up for another 
monster game.
And 
then, 
on 
that 
same 
possession, she found herself open 
behind the defense, a clear look at 
the basket. The ball flew over the 
defender and Robbins caught it in 
the air. She landed awkwardly, a 
shout ringing out — her right knee 
buckling.
Just like that, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team lost its 
best defender, its second-leading 
scorer and one of its most capable 
rebounders. Her ACL torn, the 
senior’s 
breakout 
season 
was 
finished. Her career, over.
“Unfortunately, I have suffered 
an ACL tear that will keep me out 
for the remainder of my senior 
season,” Robbins said on Twitter 
Tuesday evening. “As much as it 

pains me that I will never get to 
play in a Michigan jersey again, I 
know that God has a plan for me 
and my future.”
From the very start of the 
season, she established what would 
come in her first year as a consistent 
starter. Scoring 17 points and 
playing 35 minutes in the season-
opener against Western Michigan, 
she led the team in scoring while 
locking down any offensive threat 
she guarded.
“(Robbins) goes so hard, and 
she’s gone so hard throughout 
her career that she hits the wall,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
said after that game. “She does such 
a great job and then she doesn’t 
sustain, so I really challenged her, 
and Kayla and I spend a lot of time 
talking about this, ‘Kayla you’ve 
gotta be able to push through and 
continue because we’re gonna need 
you to play more minutes than 
you’ve ever played before in your 
life.’ ”
Despite Barnes Arico’s concerns, 
Robbins didn’t show signs of 
slowing down, displaying her 
ability to keep up energy regardless 
of minutes or opponent.
On Dec. 5 against Syracuse, 
Robbins proved she was a force to 
be reckoned with, scoring 23 points 
— a huge chunk of those coming in 

the fourth quarter and overtime. 
Robbins, almost single-handedly, 
saved that game for the Wolverines, 
suffocating defenders and diving 
on loose balls, all with four fouls.
Entering league play, Robbins’ 
name was arguably listed right 
below sophomore forward Naz 
Hillmon’s on opposing coaches’ 
scouting report. That didn’t stop 
her from playing big minutes 
and contributing big point and 
rebounding totals.
For Michigan, though, Robbins’ 
biggest contributions came as a 
leader on the court. One of two 
senior captains, the team looked 
up to her as an example of what to 
strive for.
“Kayla brings a spark every 
single day,” junior forward Hailey 
Brown said after a Dec. 31 victory 
over Penn State. “Every single day 
at practice as well, which does 
not go unnoticed. She’s willing to 
sacrifice her body for anything 
and she’s very aggressive on ball 
defense and she’s always there for 
help side. She always brings that 
extra energy and also pushes us to 
play at that next level.”
Now, sidelined for the rest of 
the season, Robbins will have to 
transition into a leader off the 
court, where her voice will lead 
the way instead of her play. The 
Wolverines will also face a difficult 
transition on the court, with 
nothing to compensate for the loss 
of experience.
“It’s just going to be difficult 
without an experienced person 
and that’s part of the worker she 
is,” senior guard Akienreh Johnson 
said. “She’s just not going to be on 
the court, so my leadership role is 
definitely going to have to change.
“Mine is going to have to change, 
but also everybody else — (Hillmon) 
is going to have to step up, be a more 
vocal leader. (sophomore guard) 
Amy (Dilk) is going to have to step 
up, I think (sophomore guard) 
Danielle (Rauch) did a great job 
during that game of being a vocal 
leader.”
Replacing Robbins’ on-court 
production, similar to filling her 
voice, will also be by committee. 
Michigan’s bench has struggled to 
make a significant impact on games, 
and while in Sunday’s matchup 
Rauch played a solid 31 minutes 
filling the void, more players will 

need to produce in bigger ways.
“(Robbins) is not the type 
of person you can replace, like 
there’s no one on our team that can 
replace (Robbins), but I think all, 
collectively, we’re going to have to 
step up,” Rauch said. “I think that 
a lot of the time when I’ve gotten 
in, I looked to like pass a lot and I 
think I’m going to have to start 
being a little more aggressive in 
that aspect.”
While Rauch will have to step 
up, 
presumably 
replacing 
her 
starting spot, so will Robbins’ 
fellow starters like Johnson, Brown 
and Dilk. Johnson and Dilk will 
try and match her potent ability to 
drive to the lane, while Brown will 
need to try and space the floor like 
Robbins did.
Sophomore forward Emily Kiser 
and freshman center Izabel Varejão 
will also play big roles in the paint 
in future games — with Kiser’s 
smooth, 49.1 percent shooting 
percentage a plus, spacing out the 
court and giving Hillmon more 
room to work.
There were glimpses in Sunday’s 
game of the team coming together 
to try and replace Robbins — 
Johnson and Brown had some 
of their highest scoring games in 
recent memory with Brown nearly 
doubling her average point total 
and Johnson scoring four more 
than her average. Varejão looked 
dangerous for the first time in 
months for a short spurt in the 
second quarter, scoring eight.
But it still wasn’t enough to 
procure a road win in Lincoln, and 
for Michigan to achieve its goals 
this season, those players will need 
to do even more.
The Wolverines lost one of their 
most explosive players, someone 
who can — and has — changed the 
outcomes of games for them.
That, though, wasn’t the thought 
running through Barnes Arico’s 
mind as she turned Robbins over, 
fear and worry plastered on her 
face, watching her captain writhe 
in pain. It wasn’t going through the 
team’s mind as they watched from 
afar, hands over mouths.
It wasn’t in Johnson’s mind 
as she turned back from the 
timeout huddle, looking once, 
twice and thrice as she watched 
her roommate helped down the 
tunnel.

A

sk any coach or player 
right now and they’ll 
tell you how hard it 
is to win a 
road game in 
the Big Ten. 
“With 
this league, 
seven years 
in it, there is 
no place we 
go where it’s 
not raucous, 
loud and 
filled-up 
with pas-
sionate fan bases,” Minnesota 
coach Richard Pitino said 
after the Golden Gophers beat 
Michigan on Jan. 12 in Min-
neapolis. “We’ve gotta have 
a great home crowd. I’m very 
appreciative of every fan that 
comes to the games. Every-
where we play is a madhouse. 
That’s why the Big Ten is awe-
some.”
“I think it’s just the crowd,” 
freshman guard Cole Bajema 
said on Tuesday. “Obviously it 
gets loud when other teams get 
on a run. When it gets loud, it’s 
difficult to hear play calls and 
other types of things. I mean, 
as the record shows, home 
court plays a big role so far.” 
That might even be an 
understatement. Six weeks 
into conference play and road 
teams are a combined 9-42 
in Big Ten matchups. What’s 
more, no one’s been immune to 
the road woes — No. 17 Mary-
land is 1-3, No. 19 Iowa and 
newly-ranked Rutgers are both 
1-2. Just last week, Michi-
gan State was drubbed by 29 
points at Purdue. Michigan, 
meanwhile, is 0-4 away from 
Crisler Center. Its opponent on 
Wednesday night, Penn State, 
despite being 13-5 overall, is 
0-3.
Those last two figures 
underscore the larger point: 
Back home, the Wolverines 
need to win their next two 
games — the first against the 
Nittany Lions and the second 

against Illinois on Saturday. 
Michigan, which has lost 
three of its last four, currently 
sits 11th in the Big Ten stand-
ings at 2-4. While it’s only 
mid-January and it has four-
teen opportunities remain-
ing to improve that position, 
residing amongst the likes of 
Northwestern and Nebraska — 
both slated to miss the NCAA 
Tournament according to Joe 
Lunardi’s latest Bracketology 
projections — is not ideal.
As much as Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard maintains that 
his team is focused solely on 
the next game and that the 
NCAA Tournament “hasn’t 
even crossed his mind,” 
the Wolverines’ standing 
becomes a lot more precari-
ous if they continue to lose Big 
Ten games. And, given their 
struggles on the road thus far, 
protecting their home court 
seems like the simplest way to 
avoid such a situation. 
“Right now, we’re focusing 
on Penn State,” Howard said. 
“We’re controlling what we 
can control and that’s coming 
out and playing with a lot of 
energy and effort. We know 
we’re going to have a home 
crowd here that’s looking for-
ward to seeing some Michigan 
basketball in Crisler, so our 
guys are juiced up and excited 
about this opportunity.”
From a sheer numbers per-
spective, beating the Nittany 
Lions and the Fighting Illini 
would clearly boost the Wol-
verines’ resumé. 13-6 is better 
than 11-6, or the other alterna-
tives. 4-4 is better than their 
current mark of 2-4. Certain 
things are remarkably intui-
tive. 
Even more important is 
what back-to-back victories 
would do for Michigan’s con-
fidence. The recent skid has 
seemingly shaken the spirit of 
a team that won the Battle 4 
Atlantis just two months ago 
with relative ease. 
“I think (emotion) is some-

thing that we need, something 
that we lost during the course 
of the season,” freshman for-
ward Franz Wagner said on 
Friday after a 90-83 loss at 
Iowa. “... I think that’s part of 
the game. You’re confident in 
yourself, you’re trying to win 
and you’re trying to stand up 
for your team.” 
Added Bajema: “Getting two 
home games in a row definite-
ly can get our confidence back 
up again before we go back on 
the road. It definitely helps.”
A more nuanced approach 
to dissecting the Wolverines’ 
losses must include the fact 
that they’re still without 
junior forward Isaiah Liv-
ers. By now, the effect of his 
absence due to a groin injury 
has been well-documented — 
Michigan sorely misses his 
on-court presence and scoring. 
If he were to return soon and 
lead the Wolverines to a string 
of victories, the committee 
would take that into account.
Further, none of Michigan’s 
losses fall into the category 
of “a bad loss.” When viewed 
individually, tasting defeat at 
Illinois, Michigan State, Min-
nesota and Iowa is somewhat 

understandable. When consid-
ered as part of a pattern, a dif-
ferent story emerges. All that 
is to say, the Big Ten is deep. 
“The beauty of this confer-
ence is you’re going to get 
Quad 1 win opportunities 
every single week,” Pitino 
said. “You can look at this con-
ference top to bottom and you 
can make a case right now, and 
it is mid-January, you can get 
12 teams in (the NCAA Tour-
nament).”
Given the Wolverines’ 
home-court advantage in the 
next two contests, victories 
over Penn State and Illinois 
would actually fall into the 
Quadrant 2 bucket. Nonethe-
less, with the Nittany Lions 
receiving AP votes and the 
Illini ranked 21st, they’d be 
quality wins. Wins they need. 
“A lot of home teams are 
winning and we want to keep 
that up,” senior center Jon 
Teske said. “We want to pro-
tect home court and play hard, 
play smart and we’ll see what 
happens.”

Wolverines take first 
at the Windy City Invite

After coming in second in the 
Windy City Invitational last year, 
the Michigan men’s gymnastics 
team came into this year’s edition 
with a mission and a swagger 
unbounded. 
“We are the best team in the Big 
Ten,” Michigan coach Kurt Golder 
said. 
His confidence showed on the 
scoreboard — with a team score of 
400.00 to close out the meet, the 
Wolverines took home first place 
against a field that included Big 
Ten opponents in Iowa, Minnesota 
and Illinois. 
Starting off strong is important 
in any sport, but especially in 
gymnastics where the smallest 
movements 
can 
make or break 
a 
meet. 
Junior 
Cameron 
Bock 
was ready to take 
his moment and 
run with it. 
Beginning 
on 
vault, Bock scored 
a career high 14.75 
and Junior Nick 
Guy added a 14.45, 
coming 
third 
overall, to give the Wolverines the 
lead after their first event with a 
team score of 70.70. 
On the parallel bars, Bock lead 
the charge again with a team-high 
14.10, good for second overall in 
the event. Senior Mitchell Brown 
was the next highest scorer for the 
Wolverines with 13.60. Despite 
the high individual scores, Illinois 
captured the lead after a strong 
performance on vault for its second 
rotation. 
Facing the lead change, Golder 
made sure to alert his squad to 
keep their guards up. Like a well-
oiled machine, the Wolverines 
followed his advice all night. 
On their third rotation, high bar, 
junior Jonathan Liu flipped his 

way to a career high 13.75 and won 
the event overall while freshman 
Paul Juda contributed a strong 
13.60. With those performances, 
Michigan 
regained 
the 
lead, 
carrying a team total 204.15. 
With Minnesota and Illinois 
not too far behind, the Wolverines 
didn’t waver. Through the fourth 
rotation, on floor, Bock again gave 
a stellar performance capturing 
second overall and scoring a team 
high 13.80. 
On the fifth rotation — now 
with over a two point lead for 
the Wolverines overall — Bock 
dominated the event with a 14.00. 
The next closest opposing score on 
the pommel horse was a 13.75. 
“(Bock) 
just 
sets 
a 
good 
standard,” Golder said. “(He) 
does it daily (and) hasn’t had a 
bad practice this 
year.”
As 
Michigan 
held a 1.60 point 
lead 
heading 
into 
the 
last 
rotation, 
Juda 
put in a 13.30 
performance 
with 
senior 
Thomas 
Paul 
and Bock each 
adding 
13.20. 
After obtaining a 65.60 on rings, 
the Wolverines secured the victory 
with a team score of 400.00, 
holding off Minnesota’s 398.75. 
Along with the team win, Brock 
achieved second in the all-around 
and Michigan won four out of 
six individual events while seven 
Wolverines made their collegiate 
debuts. 
Even with the strong start to the 
season, Golder still saw room for 
improvement. 
“Hit routine percentage is our 
focus,” Golder said. “ (We) can 
only control the controllables. 
Hopefully we can get our (injured) 
guys back in (and) strengthen our 
lineup (because) we’re not that 
deep.”

Why 
destruction 
is the new 
American 
pastime


I

n the past few weeks of January, 
news headlines, social media and 
essentially every aspect of my digital 
media sphere seem to have been dominated 
by Oscars news. Even for someone who con-
siders herself relatively removed from the 
world of cinema, it’s impossible to ignore 
the buzz. Discussions about whether the 
Netflix Original “Marriage Story” deserved 
its nomination, if a remake of Bong Joon-
ho’s “Parasite” would be inherently Western 
culture-centric and therefore ill-advised 
— and, perhaps the most prominent story — 
the conspicuous absence of nominations for 
women in major categories. 
Lack of female voices in creative fields is 
by no means a new development — in Octo-
ber of 2019 when the Museum of Modern 
Art expanded its holdings to represent 28 
percent of works by female artists, this was 
seen as a major improvement in gender pari-
ty. Many stories in this same vein have taken 

their turn in the depersonal-
izing spotlight of the 24-hour 
news cycle.
Yet, somehow, each time 
one of these stories highlight-
ing the lack of female voices 
breaks, it triggers a familiar 
response in me — lots of com-
plicated emotions, but pri-
marily deep-seated, visceral 
disappointment. Lack of rep-
resentation for female artists 
is not a new phenomenon, 
and I’m obviously pleased 
that these situations are get-
ting called out. Why, then, 
does this subject continue to 
feel so fundamentally upset-
ting?
Over this past winter 
break, my mother talked me 
into attending a jazz concert 
in which some acquaintances 
from high school were play-
ing. I was less than thrilled 
about the prospect of attend-
ing for a multitude of rea-
sons: an ex-boyfriend would 
be there, I hadn’t seen most 
of these people in years. Yet 
something else about the idea 
of attending — something 
that I couldn’t quite put my 
finger on — made me uneasy.
I went, subject to my mother’s pleading, 
and because I was quite frankly bored by 
this point of break and had exhausted all my 
hometown entertainment options. The band 
was good, predictably — a conglomerate of 
students and recent grads from prestigious 
music schools across the country. Around 
me, the primarily male crowd bobbed their 
heads in time to the music, contributing 
enthusiastic “yeah”s and “alright!”s if a solo-
ist played a particularly intricate lick.
Sitting in the corner, I felt myself unable 
to engage with the energy around me. My 
attention fixed on the bass player — a young 
woman remarkably good at staying on the 
beat and capturing the intricacies of diffi-
cult chord changes. I watched as she bit her 
lip and squinted at the music, her foot tap-
ping and fingers plucking away at a steady 
rhythm. I knew her vaguely — my sister had 
roomed with her at a jazz camp and she was 

studying at a well-renowned conservatory.
Her presence on the stage fascinated me. 
She was one of two women in the sixteen-
piece band, with the other playing trumpet 
in the back row. How must she feel, sur-
rounded by men to every side of her? More 
interesting to me — how had she even made 
it onto the stage in this performance?
In high school, I played piano in my 
school’s jazz band. Freshman year, when a 
boy a year older asked me to join his combo, 
or small jazz ensemble, with five other peo-
ple, I jumped at the opportunity. I played 
at gigs, a few of them even paid, and went 
to jazz camp in the San Jacinto mountains 
during the summer. I was a jazz person, I 
decided. This was my niche, at least for the 
moment.
Yet I found myself unwittingly begin-
ning to occupy a particular role in this world 
I’d entered. The boy who asked me to join 
the band called me “sweetheart,” insisting 
he’d tutor me in the aspects of jazz I was 
still uncomfortable with. The few girls in 
the jazz ensembles I played in were relent-
lessly bombarded with male attention, and 
not the wanted kind. The dynamic in our 
school band was clear: The boys were there 
to be musicians and improve and the girls 
were there to make the band look more visu-
ally appealing. My high school band direc-
tor didn’t do anything to dispel this notion, 
emphasizing his preference for women to 
wear “classy dresses” rather than pantsuits 
for performances and egging on boys in 
their pursuit of girls in the class. 
When I went to jazz camp during the sum-
mers, not a single instructor was a woman. I 
watched my male peers laugh at instructors’ 
jokes, saw the gleam in their eyes as they 
watched the instructors perform and knew 
that my friends were seeing all the possibili-
ties of who they could become.
I never had the opportunity to see any of 
that for myself.
Sure, I’d never intended to be a serious 
jazz musician. But could my aspirations have 
been changed if I’d felt that I had a real place 
in the field? Jazz never felt as if it was made 
for me. It was made for the men around me, 
the boys following in their footsteps. I was 
just lucky if I got to tag along for part of that 
ride.
Watching that bass player in the perfor-
mance venue, all I could think about was all 

the times she must have been called “sweet-
heart” or hit on in some other weird and 
insulting way, all while trying to do her job 
or perform the music she loved. I imagined 
all the times she’d been asked to wear a flat-
tering dress for a performance. I thought of 
her taking master classes with the almost-
exclusively-male teachers, having nobody to 
see her future self mirrored in.
In the 92 years the Academy Awards have 
existed, five women have been nominated 
for the Best Director category. Five — in 
almost a century. This statistic also doesn’t 
even begin to touch upon the discrimination 
toward women of color in the industry: In 
2020, only one woman of color was nominat-
ed for any category, Cynthia Erivo for Best 
Actress. It’s also worth noting this nomina-
tion is for Erivo’s portrayal of Harriet Tub-
man — which, as Vox aptly addresses, feels a 
bit too much like a bad joke. 
I can’t help but wonder if those women 
in the film industry, in their directing 
classes or internships or workshops, were 
also called “sweetheart” by peers. If they 
also had almost exclusively men to look up 
to. If they also were painstakingly aware of 
the space they occupied in any given room, 
surrounded by men who never had to doubt 
their place there. 
If the continued lack of female represen-
tation feels simultaneously deeply familiar 
and fundamentally unsettling to me — a 
woman who has but dabbled in the creative 
fields — what must it feel like to women for 
whom this is their profession, their life?
It’s clear that creative industries around 
us inherently value male voices more than 
female voices. That these are the projects, 
the films, the solo performances that society 
uplifts, at the expense of their female peers. 
I wish there had been more women, par-
ticularly women of color, nominated for the 
Oscars, but that’s such a small piece of the 
story. Before the films are made, a woman 
has to decide she wants to be a director and 
pursue a future in the industry. She has to 
practice her craft, to apply for tough jobs and 
internships, to decide this is her space and 
she’s going to climb her way to the top of it. 
And if the atmosphere surrounding the film 
industry is anything like the jazz sphere — 
and I have a nasty feeling that it is — women 
have a long, unpleasant road ahead before 
we get anywhere close to gender parity.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | JANUARY 15, 2020

I thought I’d aged out of this years ago. I’m sitting criss-cross-applesauce in my apartment while my roommate 
straightens my hair. The brush catches my hair knots and pulls my head back like the boys in my elementary 
school used to do, though it wasn’t because they liked me. 
The hair situation isn’t going as planned. My curls are beginning to spring back from stress sweat, either caused 
by the fact that I’m going to a dance with a stranger or the fear that I won’t fit in with the crowd. I have less than 
20 minutes to figure out how I can turn my curly hair, acne and glasses into something remotely resembling a

T

he loud music, dim lighting and cheap liquor 
blurred my surroundings in Rick’s American 
Cafe, an underground hideaway for most seniors 
at the University of Michigan. It was the beginning of 
another interminable Thursday night. It took me a few 
seconds to notice that a man had slid into the sticky 
upholstered seating next to me. He was inches away from 
my bare arm and lightly bumped into me, giving himself 
away. 
“Sorry,” I said, moving a bit closer to my friend, “My 
bad.” Instead of backing away, he leaned in closer: a 
stranger with dark features. 
“Don’t be sorry, hi,” he replied, too close to my face now 
— I leaned away again. He was right, I shouldn’t be sorry, 
he’d bumped into me. He proceeded to mercilessly hit on 
me — asking questions, prodding me with compliments — 
and didn’t seem to pick up on my lack of interest or desire. 
I acted politely, trying to both respond nicely yet appear 
uninterested, but it was no use. I continuously turned my 
back to him, facing my friends, and he poked 
at my exposed shoulders, asking for a phone 
number I had already told him I didn’t give 
out. When he failed to receive the affirmation 
he sought, he began to berate me and made 
me feel bad for being uninterested. Some of 
my friends got involved, politely asking him 
to leave me alone. 
Finally, before relocating to another bar, I 
said “I’m sorry, I’m just not interested right 
now. See you around.” 
I’m sure many women in Rick’s and other 
bars like it had similar experiences on that 
night, in past nights and will have them in 
the nights to follow. I couldn’t understand 
what gave him, a stranger, the agency to 
speak to me in a derogatory, patronizing 
way. Furthermore, the interaction triggered 
a thought: What would happen if women 
spoke to men in this way –– refusing no 
for an answer, calling a stranger “baby,” 
“sweetheart” or “sexy” and subsequently 
getting angry at them when they appear 
uninterested. What if women did this to 
men at bars or otherwise? Would they apologize 
to us politely as I just had, even when being harassed? 
Probably not. We would be labeled “psychopath,” “crazy” 
or even “bitch.”
Though it may seem trivial, the difference in 
communication style between men and women, 
especially when they communicate with each other, is a 
much larger issue than just a run-in at a college bar. One 
could argue that these gendered behaviors permeate 
everyday life for women in both social and professional 
spheres. Along with the tolerance for the misbehavior of 
men toward women. 
In 2014, Jill Abramson, editor in chief of The New York 
Times, was fired on an unknown basis. Many speculated 
she was let go due to pushy and abrasive tactics in the 
newsroom: the way she spoke to employees. However, 
the widely agreed upon reason for her firing was that 
Abramson brought the issue of unequal pay –– between 
herself and her predecessor Bill Keller –– to the attention 
of The New York Times and was subsequently fired. 
Whatever the true reason, gender has been closely linked 
to the case and many women in the newsroom have 
decided it was a driving reason for her getting fired. 
Situations like this one showcase subtle sexism and 

the microaggressions toward women. These types 
of microaggressions have been studied by social 
scientist Madeline E. Heilman who splits this type of 
gendered workplace bias into two forms. 
The first is the descriptive stereotype, which 
preemptively allots different characteristics to women 
such as emotional, soft, sensitive and sweet. Heilman 
describes the result of the descriptive stereotypes in the 
workplace as a woman being treated differently due to a 
“lack of fit,” meaning a woman’s supposed-personality 
not fitting with the needs of the role, one which would be 
typically held by a man. 
Conversely, men are seen as objective, assertive and 
rational in positions of power in the workplace and can 
behave as such within flexible boundaries. If a woman 
speaks in a bold tone — one that a man could exert in the 
same position of power — it would be seen as unfit to her 
stereotypically feminine, soft nature and result in a firing 
like Abramson’s. 

The other workplace bias of prescriptive stereotype 
takes shape when women hold positions of power 
formerly or commonly held by men. These women are 
then seen out of their prescribed place in society and are 
judged for not acting compassionately. Male counterparts 
and media will then label her as a “bitch” whereas a man 
would be lauded for the same behavior.
Traits that are received positively in men in positions 
of power — even abrasive and commandeering tactics — 
are received negatively in women and oftentimes lead to 
them being called a bitch by coworkers and the media, 
rather than a powerful, erudite force to be reckoned with. 
Abramson, Hillary Clinton, Madeleine Albright and 
even Ruth Bader Ginsburg have all been subject to such 
name-calling and disrespect because they’re motivated, 
ambitious figures of authority. Perhaps they don’t 
showcase soft femininity in the ways they’re “supposed” 
to, but that does not warrant the offensive and inaccurate 
term “bitch.” 
Deborah Tannen, a linguist at Georgetown University, 
actively studies what she’s coined the “Hillary Factor.” 
She’s interested in how unfeminine leaders are perceived 
in society. If women are being called things like 

“bossy,” “cruel,” “mean-spirited,” “combative,” “rude,” 
“impossible” and “brusque” — to name a few terms — 
how many fewer women will seek out positions of power 
for fear of being called bossy or worse by their male 
counterparts? 
The gendered issue of stark communication differences 
trickles down to everyday life. Women are taught 
implicitly by society to make themselves smaller in large 
lecture settings and even small discussion sections in 
universities — to be spoken over or spoken at, opposed to 
in conjunction with. We apologize if we inconvenience a 
man, even if it isn’t an inconvenience; from bumping into 
someone on the street to declining sexual or romantic 
advancements.
The patronizing way in which women are spoken to by 
men and the way women have been conditioned to speak 
has become such a prevalent issue that it has caught the 
attention of brands like the creators of Barbie, Mattel, 
Inc. Barbie’s new online vlog forum, Mattel Inc. released 
a vlog called “The Sorry Reflex.” In the video, 
Barbie teaches young women how to navigate 
social and professional spheres without using 
the word sorry when it isn’t necessary to say 
it. In the vlog, Barbie says, “I think there’s a 
bigger issue with the word sorry. Especially 
with girls. We say it a lot.” Eventually, “Sorry 
is a learned reflex.” 
The issue of gendered communication is 
clearly prevalent if Barbie, a brand of dolls 
targeted to 3-to-6-year-old girls, is addressing 
the issue to toddlers. 
Behind everyday language lies expectations 
of behavior and persona in the workplace and 
otherwise: When women are assertive and 
bold, it doesn’t fit what is expected of us. We 
teach girls to physically shrink themselves 
smaller, to always say yes, to lead with grace 
and sweetness and to be flirtatious and coy. At 
the same time, we are not to be too assertive 
and cannot give too much away. 
Conversely, we teach boys to fight, to be 
aggressive and bold and to claim leadership.
The way in which men speak to and treat 
women is important. The question remains: In 
the grand scheme of issues troubling our nation, should 
this be at the forefront of what we’d like to change? The 
answer is yes. Though many of us do not think before 
we speak, communication affects the entire structure 
of our society and how women are spoken to on a daily 
basis further supports the patriarchy. Women have been 
conditioned to acquiesce, because if we don’t there will 
be consequences ranging from something as minor as 
name-calling and embarrassment in a crowded college 
bar, to something as extreme as being fired from a job. 
Saying “sorry” to the man in Rick’s and feeling guilty 
about declining his advances isn’t a groundbreaking 
experience. Unfortunately, it’s rather common. But what 
it does teach us, albeit subliminally, is that as women, we 
are expected to be subordinate to men in every situation. 
An unwarranted “sorry” at a bar or club quickly turns into 
this behavior at work, in intimate personal relationships 
and beyond. We must teach our sons to treat women 
with respect as the equals we are. We must teach our 
daughters that it is okay to be the bossy Barbie — to be 
fierce and bold and authoritative. Next time, instead of 
saying sorry, say thank you for understanding.

The truth behind “sorry”

W

e don’t wanna just throw the 
axe at the board. We wanna 
throw through the board. 
Whatever it takes.”
Anthony Taylor, the bearded and tattooed 
co-owner of Axe Ventura, Ann Arbor’s 
newest and only axe throwing venue, is 
giving me a pep talk. My friend Emily and 
I have been chucking axes at the wall for 
the past 15 minutes, and I can’t land a stick 
(Emily, for the record, stuck her second 
throw). 
I assume position: toes on the line, axe in 
front, left hand over right. I raise the weapon 
above my head, arching it backward until 
the butt of the blade kisses my spine, and 
try to think the sort of thoughts that might 
send my axe not at but through a solid wall 
of wood. I take a step and release, hoping I’m 
right. 
The axe hits the bullseye, but with the 
wrong end — the flat one — which I didn’t 
know was possible. It clatters to the floor, 
where I retrieve it timidly.
Anthony indicates for me to try again 
by pointing to a blue line on the floor with 
his right crutch. He recently tore his ACL 
and meniscus playing flag football. When 
I walked in half-an-hour earlier, he was 
throwing on crutches, single-handedly.
“Okay, good. Again.”
T

he evolution of axe throwing from 
a noun-verb pair to a continental 
pastime spans back to Toronto, 
2006. According to an interview with Red 
Bull’s lifestyle magazine, Matt Wilson was 
“crushing beers at (his) friend’s cottage … 
kind of bored,” when someone pulled out 
a hatchet and taught him how to throw it. 
Wilson “just thought it was a lot of fun” 
and started a backyard axe throwing league 
among his buddies to keep the vibe alive. 
Sprinkled with a little entrepreneurial fervor, 
Wilson’s hobby leveled up to the Backyard 
Axe Throwing League, otherwise known 
as BATL, Canada’s premier axe throwing 
franchise and a founding member of 
the International Axe Throwing Federation. 
Wilson himself never replied to my emails 
or LinkedIn DMs — perhaps he was too busy 
drumming for his basement rock band. 
The most unprecedented element of 
Wilson’s story, though, is in its wake. 
Over the past decade, axe throwing has 
swept through the urban continent like a 
recreational contagion. Canadian chains 
like BATL and Bad Axe brought the pastime 
to the U.S. around the mid-to-late-2010s, 
spurring the rise of rivaling domestic 
franchises like Urban Axes as well as local 
independent ranges.
Axe throwing venues tend to aggregate 
and thrive in the usual suspects — New 
York, Chicago, Denver, Atlanta — as well as 
any municipality that mildly gentrifies in 
the Midwest or mid-Atlantic. This includes 
Louisville, the inspiration for Ann Arbor’s 
own Axe Ventura. Shannon Kozyra, Axe 
Ventura’s co-owner and former high school 
classmate of Anthony’s, managed to give me 
the origin story over the fond din of clanging 

and banging that characterizes her new 
venue. 
“We went to Louisville last New Year’s, 
and this one guy we talked to was like, 
‘There’s this new axe throwing venue,’ and 
you have to understand this, he...” 
She paused to point accusingly at Anthony. 
They 
were 
wearing 
identical 
t-shirts 
emblazoned with the title “AXE MASTER.”
“... is good at anything you put in front 
of him. … So, in my mind’s eye I was like, 
‘Great, another thing I’m gonna lose at, just 
gotta have a good attitude about it.’ … But 
we go and do this, and I stick my first one, 
and I was like,” she stepped back, her mouth 
making an ecstatic “O.”
I turned to Anthony.
“Did you stick your first one?”
“I did not.”
“In fact, I beat him, the first time we ever 
played,” Shannon continued, adjusting her 
blond curls under a Nike ball cap. “But it’s 
kind of like one of those beginner’s luck 
things, because I haven’t since.”
The two were hooked and began bouncing 
ideas around for Axe Ventura on the drive 
back from Kentucky.
“Because we loved it, we looked into 
doing it here and noticed that the closest 
place was Novi and we’re like, ‘That 
won’t do.’ So, then we just spent the next 
11 months making it happen,” Anthony 
explained.
Making it happen turned out to be quite 
the feat. Axe Ventura took over the lease 
of Gold Bond Cleaners, a family-owned 
dry cleaner that operated on Maynard 
between Frank’s Restaurant and Madras 
Masala for 40 years. Anthony, Shannon 
and co-owner Connor Duggan “Shark-
Tank-pitched” the owners for the rights 
to the space then labored for months to 
get it up to code. They had to figure out 
the whole process, “from commercial real 
estate to business to funding.” It took a bit 
longer than expected because Anthony 
and Connor are students at the University 
of Michigan.
“Wait, what? You guys are undergrads?” 
I interrupted. “How do you have time for 
this?”
“Right,” Anthony replied, deadpan.
They’re military veterans, too. Anthony, 
who studies kinesiology and was in the 
Coast Guard, and Connor, who studies 
economics and was in the Air Force, would 
attend classes Monday to Friday then put in 
40 hours each weekend building the place: 
the bathrooms, the throwing stalls, the 
soundproofing panels spray-painted with 
their custom logo and Instagram handle (@
Axe.Ventura). 
“Yeah, it’s not for the faint of heart,” 
Shannon added, regarding the process.
But the effort is evident. The likes of 
332 Maynard have been transformed into 
full post-industrial chic: corrugated sheet 
metal lines the throwing stalls, massive 
LED lights hang from the ceiling by wires 
and minimalist metal stools wait by bars 
constructed of unfinished wood (liquor 

license ETA: three weeks). When we walked 
in on Saturday afternoon, “Loser” by Beck 
was blaring from a Bluetooth speaker zip-
tied to a galvanized chain-link fence. The 
only trace of the dry cleaner remaining 
is an unfathomably heavy, authentically 
industrial safe behind the front counter, 
now used to store axes. 
So far, the space has mostly attracted 
clientele of similar chic — think bachelorette 
parties, corporate events and team-building 
forays. But they’re working on student 
outreach.
“We might run a student league, give 
students a chance to come in here for a 
different rate,” said Shannon. Renting a stall 
for an hour currently runs at $35 a person.
“I want to start an axe throwing club at 
the University,” added Connor. “I think it 
would be cool … to get people into it younger, 
because I feel like the demographic right 
now is, like, 30 and up.”
I asked Connor why he thought that was.
“Because they have time, you know.” 
He explained. “They have time, they have 
money. They have time for hobbies. We don’t 
have time for hobbies.”
I 

eventually got my stick. You have to 
realize, a first stick in the axe throwing 
world is like a first communion, a first 
menstrual period. It’s an initiation rite. I 
could hear it in my audio recording — an 
unceremonious thud recontextualized by 
immediate whooping and hollering. I think 
someone clapped me on the back.
“You see how that felt. Now you 
understand,” Anthony told me. “The first 
time I stuck one, I was like — ” he clenched 
his fists and mouthed “FUCK YEAH.”
This euphoric first stick phenomenon 
seems to be the lifeblood of the axe throwing 
industry. It’s a hot, instant nostalgia that, 
once tasted, keeps the interest — and its 
capital — flowing through business doors.
“The biggest thing I hear people saying is, 
‘I can see it as a novelty, do it once, just to 
see what it was like, then I come and do it, 
and I just want to do it all the time.’ They 
just want to come back and do it again, do 
it again and do it again. It’s just that much 
fun,” Anthony told me.
You may recognize this as the logic of 
a gateway drug. And there’s certainly an 
abstract element of addiction going on here, 
a hyper-focused and wholly competitive 
striving for exactness in repetition, again, 
again, again, goddammit.
But I don’t think I have it. Maybe it’s 
because I was technically on assignment, 
or because my friends were watching me 
flounder, or because I was dead sober, but 
I didn’t share Anthony’s “FUCK YEAH.” I 
looked at my axe, wedged in the second or 
third ring from the target’s center, and felt 
blank relief. 
That being said, I’m also not the type 
of person who would return from the Air 
Force and decide that the thing to do is to 
plan, build and operate an independent 
axe throwing venue while simultaneously 
pursuing an economics degree and prepping 

for both the civil service exam and the LSAT 
(Connor, you inhuman beast, I salute you). 
There’s a certain sort of extreme that this 
activity self-selects for, it seems, and to get 
down to the bottom of it, I decided to start 
at the top.
S

am Carter is the current IATF axe 
throwing world champion.
“I was an arborist before doing 
all this, and my girlfriend saw (a venue) was 
opening up in Charlotte, where I was living 
at the time, so I was instantly like, ‘Well, 
hell yeah, let’s do that,’” Carter said in a 
recent Facebook phone call with The Daily. 
After returning to the Charlotte venue two 
to three times a week, Carter responded to 
a hiring notice and began working for the 
franchise. This was in 2017. Today, Carter 
is the general manager at their Winston-
Salem location. 
“Wait … so you’re telling me that in two 
years you became the world champion?” I 
interrupted.
Sam paused.
“Yeah … I mean, it’s just for fun, I 
mean, it sounds like a lot, but it’s not. I 
mean, it’s axe throwing. It’s just, like, a 
bar sport,” he replied in staccato, slightly 
flustered. The status of axe throwing as a 
sport is an evolving story, but ESPN3 did 
broadcast the 2019 championships live. 
Official recognition as the best in the 
world is exceptional, whether it’s for 
checkers, steeplechase, quiz bowl or axe 
throwing. It implies years of diligence, a 
childhood prodigy story or some ungodly 
combination of the two. Sam Carter, on 
the other hand, good-naturedly rolled 
into a “hell yeah” and casually popped 
out number one. I was drawing another 
blank, feeling on the outside of some 
larger understanding, not unlike the 
experience of my bathetic first stick. 
I asked Carter what had hooked him 
about it in the first place.
“I don’t know, it’s just fun to throw a sharp 
object,” he said. “You get to do it all the time, 
and people let you do it. ‘Cause when I was 
a kid, I used to go steal my dad’s axe and 
throw it at a tree and then put it back after 
two throws because I thought I was gonna 
break it. Now I do it for a living.” 
When you stick the word “venue” on it, 
axe throwing becomes more than the simple 
indulgence of a primal thrill. It’s suddenly 
organized, perhaps professional. Instead of 
throwing at a tree for the hell of it, you’re 
aiming at a target. The thing you snuck out 
to do as a child is sanctioned with the three 
concentric circles of a bullseye. You’ve paid 
to do it. As Sam said to me, “people let you 
do it.”
The space to openly engage with taboo is a 
heady permission, but is it enough to spawn 
a world championship trajectory? It seemed 
too simple to me. But fascination with the 
forbidden appears to be an affecting entry 
point to the sport for world champions 
and weekend enthusiasts alike. An activity 
that requires you to sign a waiver is kind 
of sexy. University seniors Ryley Verde and 

AJ Arons frequently go axe throwing as a 
partners’ activity and talked to me about 
their comparable affinity for the sport over 
coffee last week.
“It’s so satisfying when you split a board 
and then you have to literally replace the 
board because you destroyed it,” said Ryley. 
Both she and AJ have split multiple boards 
in their throwing careers.
“Have you ever used an axe for anything 
besides axe throwing?” I asked.
Ryley thought for a moment.
“Like camping axes, but not like for 
splitting wood. Other than that, I don’t 
really have a use for an axe in my daily life.”
“I think that’s part of the fun, though,” 
AJ added, “because it is a weapon. It’s not 
just throwing something and hitting it well. 
Tennis is great, hitting overhead is fun, but 
you’re throwing a weapon at something, and 
that is so satisfying.”
My ears perked at AJ’s response. They 
used the word “weapon” with the same 
mysticism as “first stick.”
T

here is a place where you are 
permitted to use weapons without 
the pretense of a bullseye. It’s 
called the rage room, and its history as a pay-
to-participate pastime runs near-parallel to 
that of axe throwing: The first rage room 
opened in Japan in 2008 before spreading 
to Europe and the United States with gusto, 
becoming a burgeoning urban industry and 
cultural fad.
But its premise is even more basic. There 
is a wall of weapons and a room of junk. 
Upon payment, the application of the former 
to the latter is sanctioned. Be free. 
Since everybody else in this story seems 
to have touched the sublime via recreational 
destruction, I decided the rage room was 
worth a shot. The “first stick” exactness 
game was a bust, but maybe I’m just more 
into the weapon side of things. I’ve always 
been a theory girl.
So last Saturday, my boyfriend Jacob, 
roommate Sophie and hungover-friend-
in-the-kitchen Gibby all piled into a sedan 
and drove 20 minutes north to Destruction 
Depot in Whitmore Lake, one of the three 
rage rooms in the state of Michigan. It was 
one of those cold, drizzly afternoons where 
the sun sets at 4 p.m. When we pulled 
into the parking lot, Jacob pointed out a 
correctional facility across the street.
The imagery was grim indeed, but it 
brightened substantially with the warm 
welcome and stylish shoes of Rachel 
Crawford, former school counselor and 
current co-owner of Destruction Depot 
alongside her husband, Matt.
“This business is my husband’s baby,” 
Rachel told us on a tour of the Depot. Her 
t-shirt, along with a variety of signage and 
merchandise 
throughout 
the 
business, 
proudly displayed their slogan: “ALL 
ABOARD THE RAGE TRAIN.”
“He’s an army veteran, he was blowing 
stuff up for a living when he was with the 
army and thought he wanted to have a place 
to go to where he could destroy things when 

he got out.”
The four of us nodded. We could picture 
it.
“So, when we went on our first date, six 
years ago … he talked about building a rage 
room, and I was like, ‘well, that’s crazy, but 
okay,’ so here we are.”
Destruction Depot is fitted with three 
rage rooms — two doubles and one party-
sized — built by Matt, Rachel and her father 
in 2018. Clients pay $20 per person for 
room access and safety equipment, without 
a time cap. They are then escorted to the 
“inventory 
room,” 
where 
“breakables” 
— random electronics, collectibles and 
glassware of varying size, design and quality 
— are hand-selected, labeled and priced by 
Rachel herself. She sources them from a 
local e-waste company and then, weeks later 
returns their destroyed debris.
“This is my creative outlet,” Rachel told us 
while we perused her wares, which included 
a large milk crate of wine bottles labeled 
“Mommy is ‘TIRED.’” Clients may purchase 
as many of the Depot’s “breakables” as they 
wish and/or bring up to three of their own, 
free of charge. While every client has their 
own personal taste, Rachel told us that 
overhead projectors, guitars and printers 
tend to get snatched from the inventory 
room as soon as they arrive.
“And obviously glass, people love glass,” 
Rachel added. “Mugs are my personal 
favorite, so I put some of those in your room, 
too.” We thanked her.
Destruction Depot attracts a similar group 
clientele as Axe Ventura — birthday parties, 
corporate events and student groups, for the 
most part — although Rachel found herself 
surprised by the demographics of her 
individual clients.
“I thought that we’d have a bunch of angry 
men in here a lot of the time, and it is not … 
we are primarily women. Women are by far 
our number one customers,” she told us.
Destruction Depot is also happy to 
arrange custom room setups if clients have 
something special in mind.
“We had a woman who wanted to surprise 
her husband, an accountant, at the end of 
tax season. She wanted his room set up like 
an office, so we sourced a desk, a computer 
and all of that kind of stuff. At the end of tax 
season, he came in and went crazy and loved 
it.”
The four of us, seniors about to graduate 
and enter the workforce, moved our winces 
into smiles. In an attempt to either change 
the subject or make a connection between 
motivations, Jacob asked her if people 
ever get political in the rage room. Rachel 
laughed.
“Elissa Slotkin is our congresswoman, 
when she was getting elected a year or two 
ago some of her campaign workers would 
come in, and they …”
She paused to laugh again.
“They would just, like, scream.”

achel escorted us to the gear room, instructing us 
to suit up in full-length coveralls and plastic face 
shields. We emerged resembling a very skinny 
third of BROCKHAMPTON and met her by the weapons, 
a towering wall of recycled compressed wood hung with 
baseball bats, crowbars, frying pans, sledgehammers, 
wrenches, golf clubs, hammers, hockey sticks and mallets. 
Gibby grabbed a large wrench, Sophie an orange mallet. 
Jacob took his time choosing a baseball bat and I selected 
a long yellow crowbar.
After taking our picture in front of a large marquee 
sign, she made to spell out “DESTRUCTION DEPOT 
WELCOMES THE MICHIGAN DAILY,” Rachel led us 
to the party room. In it, she had graciously pre-arranged 
a printer, television, car door, stack of plate ware and 
collection of aforementioned coffee mugs for our smashing 
pleasure. She ran us through the two rules — don’t 
purposefully destroy the room and don’t smash with the 
door open — and respectfully left us to our literal devices.
I will never be sure about what happened in the rage 
room. But I had left my pocket voice recorder on from the 
interview with Rachel, and thus happened to capture our 
experience in the party room on audio. A few days after 
our visit I listened through the whole thing, curious about 
exactly when and how the four of us ended up on the rage 
train, full swing. 
Turns out we boarded almost immediately upon Rachel’s 
departure. After a few shy wisecracks about “The Purge” 
and the chorus of Drowning Pool’s “Bodies” playing on 
the loudspeaker, someone made the first smash, inviting 
all hell to break loose. At this point in my recording, the 
conversation between the four of us fragmented into brief, 
robotically inexpressive remarks about the destruction 
we were inflicting or planning to inflict, erratically 
punctuated by ear-splitting shatters, cracks, bangs and 
blasts. Eventually, we all began to sound the same.
I want to try the bat / I want to smash this / I love the bat 

/ Just toss it up and I’ll smash down / The sledgehammer 
is so powerful / Wait can I do something really destructive 
/ Is that really what the inside of a TV looks like / Maybe a 
different weapon / I want the case to pop open / We should 
all get bats / Can someone push down on that / Okay we’ll 
get more bats.
We were operating on pure instinct, each of 
our individual characters dissolving in the simple 
adrenaline of the task at hand. At one point, without 
any discussion or stated agreement, the four of us 
converged on the stubborn inner machinery of a TV 
that refused to yield to our crowbar and began to 
methodically pull it apart by hand. It felt good, then, to 
be an animal. It feels more complicated now.
I stepped into the hallway for a moment to take 
some photos of the rampage through the party room’s 
single window. With each click of the shutter, each 
second away from the room, I became more aware of 
what I was looking at: Through the plexiglass of the 
window through the lens of my camera, my boyfriend 
and my roommate were systematically smashing a car 
door with baseball bats, back and forth, thud THUD, 
thud THUD. I lowered my camera, confused. I’m still 
confused. Were they mad? Was I mad? Am I mad now? 
And … why?
Time worked strangely in the rage room, the way an 
inopportune nap can leave you paranoid that you’ve 
slept the day away. After what felt like hours, we-in-
singularity decided the deed was done and retreated 
to the gear room to become ourselves again. My pulse 
was high, hands trembling slightly. Rachel arrived 
with complimentary bottles of water. I asked her how 
long we had been in there. She said 30 minutes.
I

t’s a bad thing. Our research shows that people feel 
good after venting, and because venting feels good, 
they assume that it must be working. But it feels 
good to take street drugs, too, or eat chocolate.”
This is the input of Dr. Brad Bushman, Social Psychology 
Ph.D. and Professor of Communication at Ohio State 
University. Dr. Bushman has spent the majority of his 

career researching aggression and spoke to The Daily 
in a recent phone interview about the rise and impact 
of recreational destruction — specifically, axe throwing 
and rage rooms.
“It’s like using gasoline to put out a fire, it just feeds 
the flame,” Bushman said. “How do you become an 
angry, aggressive person? Practice, practice, practice. 
And what do you do in these rooms? You practice how 
to behave aggressively. You throw axes, bash, break 
things, hit, kick, scream, shout, whatever.”
Initially, I was with Dr. Bushman. The morning 
after the rage room I picked up an empty mug at 
Sweetwaters and had an involuntary impulse to hurl it 
across the cafe. Objects became contextually unfixed. 
Jacob went home and immediately noticed the arena 
that was his home: piano, television, speakers, Xbox. 
“My brain doesn’t usually work in units of breakable 
or not breakable, you know,” he told me.
But after some time, the academic perspective 
seemed more and more myopic. The coffee mug ceased 
to feel like a projectile after 36 hours, and I began to 
think a little more about what was sending people to 
these establishments in the first place versus what was 
happening in their heads upon arrival.
During our coffee chat, AJ emphasized the 
accessibility of the activity — how anybody can do it, 
and how improvement is only a simple adjustment away. 
In two years, maybe you will be the axe throwing world 
champion. The primal thrill of a first stick or weapon-
in-hand is basic enough to satisfy virtually anyone to 
some extent. We are human, after all. And in a world 
of increasingly complex algorithms, politics, barriers-
to-entry and interpersonal interactions, where else is 
success so simple? So physical? So clear?
And then Ryley hit upon the social element, describing 
it as “a really great way to connect physically” with those 
around you. I’ve seen this firsthand, in the friendly and 
generative competition between Shannon and Anthony 
and the singularity achieved between myself, Gibby, 
Sophie and Jacob in the rage room. In an age of Tinder 
alienation, the idea of throwing an axe or smashing a 
television with someone seems, somehow, more profound. 
There’s a desperation in there, maybe, but it checks out. 
We are desperate.
I didn’t share the exact euphoria of all the first sticks 
and weapon-wielding of my peers, sure, but I have also 
never served in the armed forces or worked tax season 
as an accountant. I was thinking about this at yoga 
the other day, then realized what I was doing in yoga: 
paying a dumb amount of money to do something totally 
primal and taboo — roll around like an animal in a pool 
of my own sweat — in a dark, hot room washed in a 
shade of red light I describe to my friends as “feeding 
frenzy crimson.” I started going to yoga when my work 
and my studies began to intensify in a way that gave me 
somatic anxiety. I often describe it with the adjective 
“cathartic.”
The rage train has been shuttling between money, stress 
and serotonin for years, speeding up every time you have 
to learn a new programming language or explain what 
you really want to do with your life. The recreational 
slinging of weapons did not arise in a vacuum, and looks 
more to me like a symptom than a cause. There are enough 
interest and capital right now for physical rage to be having 
a moment as its own enterprise. Let’s cash in. All aboard.
So long as we are stressed and have bank accounts, we 
will pay to cope. And the harder we work, the harder we 
cope. Whose fault is that?
Back in Axe Ventura, I had asked Anthony why he 
thought axe throwing was so trendy right now.
“It’s different, something new,” he told me.
“Other than that, I don’t really know. I didn’t invent it, I 
just kind of got on board.”

hen I was 10, my mother gave 
me my first copy of “Little 
Women” in the middle of 
summer. It was a bright pink paperback 
with a monochrome drawing of a woman’s 
skirt and shoes, simple and minimalistic. 
As a little kid who was used to the detailed, 
flashy covers of “Harry Potter” and “Percy 
Jackson” books, I was less than intrigued. 
Eventually, I got past the cover. Even 
then, I found it difficult to be interested in 
the book. The language felt old and foreign, 
and the characters lived in a world that 
seemed completely different from mine in 
the 21st century. Why was I supposed to 
care about these sisters living in the 19th 
century if I had more contemporary books 
at my disposal? 
As I continued to turn the pages, the 
novel started growing on me. Marmee and 
the March sisters were all heartfelt and 
familiar, but one character stood out to 
me the most: Jo March. I identified with 
her. She was the girl I’d always wanted to 
be: smart, bold and fiercely independent. 
Above all, she loved to read and write, just 
like I did. 
Her journey to becoming a writer also 
fascinated me. In the book, Jo often scrib-
bles away in her room, dressed in a black 
pinafore so she can carelessly wipe her 
ink-covered hands. As a young girl, she’s 
constantly working on stories, exploring 
the plethora of worlds she creates. Yet, at 
the same time, the writing process isn’t 
romanticized. When she goes to New York, 
Jo’s main motivation is money — she sells 
drama-filled sensation stories for her earn-
ings. Plus, Jo faces all the normal things a 
female writer might struggle with. Pub-
lishers don’t take her seriously. Inspiration 
only comes to her in bursts. Mixed reviews 
frustrate her. 
Somehow, none of this dissuaded me. In 
my free time, I wrote my own stories in my 
colorful, flowery notebooks and hoped that 
I would one day be like Jo. 
Nine years after my mother gave me 
“Little Women,” I found myself stuck in a 
biography writing class. I was supposed to 
pick a subject for the course’s final paper, 
and initially chose Jane Austen. A writer, 
I figured, was a subject that I’d easily be 
interested in, and Austen was the first name 
I thought of. As I was writing my proposal 
paper, though, something felt off. Austen 
wasn’t right. For whatever reason, she just 
didn’t click with me. 
I went back to the drawing board. I still 
liked the idea of writing about a writer, so 
I stuck with it. I researched more writers. 
After hours of mindless scrolling through 

brief lists and biographies, I landed on a 
name that resonated with me: Louisa May 
Alcott, author of “Little Women.” 
To me, Alcott’s life was immediately 
interesting. Thanks to her Transcen-
dentalist father, she grew up among the 
likes of Hawthorne, Emerson and Tho-
reau. Even more interestingly, I found that 
Alcott hadn’t even wanted to write “Little 
Women” in the first place. The novel had 
actually been her editor’s idea, and she had 

believed the first chapters she’d written 
were boring — even “dull,” as she said in a 
letter to her editor. Yet, she continued when 
she realized her novel might have a larger 
purpose. 
“Lively, simple books are very much 

needed for girls,” Alcott wrote in her jour-
nal, “and perhaps I can supply the need.” 
With that, “Little Women” re-entered 
my life. Unlike the first time, I picked the 
book apart from the perspective of its 
author. I poured over every letter of Alcott’s 
that I could find to understand her own 
role in the story. In the end, I realized that 
I was drawn to Alcott in the same way I’d 
been drawn to Jo. They practically shared 
the same lifeblood. “Little Women,” after 

all, is semi-autobiographical. Louisa May 
Alcott’s life bleeds into Jo March’s life and 
vice versa — and both their lives have began 
to bleed into mine.
Nine years after I’d started writing in my 
notebooks, I knew how it felt to struggle 

with writing. I knew how it felt to not be 
taken seriously, or to dislike the words I’d 
written. I knew that as a young woman, this 
struggle would prove more difficult than it 
is for my male peers. Just as Jo had to fight 
for fair compensation and the respect of 
her work, women today still grapple with 
gaining recognition for their art — includ-
ing Greta Gerwig, the director of the new-
est film adaptation of “Little Women,” who 
wasn’t even nominated for this year’s Acad-
emy Award for Best Director. But I also 
knew how it felt to love writing, to find joy 
in crafting lives on paper. 
When I turned in my final biography, I 
bought myself a new copy of “Little Women” 
as a reward. It’s a light purple paperback 
and much more modern in appearance than 
my first one. As I held it in my hands, I felt 
much more connected to the book and the 
woman who created it. 
At the beginning of a completely new 
decade, I sat in one of the cramped seats 
of the Annex in the Michigan Theater. On 
the screen, a film that I had anticipated 
watching since the trailer dropped was 
playing: “Little Women.” Unlike the seven 
other adaptations of the novel, Gerwig’s 
creation offers a different retelling of “Lit-
tle Women” than the others — one that is 
nonchronological and one that draws on 
modern feminist themes, like women’s eco-
nomic rights, independence and the idea 
that domesticity, is, in fact, its own feminist 
choice. Hers acts like a love letter to Alcott, 
writing and all the pains and joys that come 
with it. 
Alcott still supplies the need. Her work 
resonates with readers to this day, thanks to 
the lively simplicity of the adventures of the 
March sisters. The years of penny pinching 
during the Civil War, dances with boys, les-
sons with Marmee, writing plays and sto-
ries for the family — they all tell raw truths 
about women through uncomplicated sto-
rytelling. This is arguably what makes “Lit-
tle Women” so powerful: It doesn’t play into 
stereotypes, it doesn’t have to overdo the 
characters’ narratives and it doesn’t have 
to have some sweeping, dramatic feminist 
message. Its mere existence as a multidi-
mensional dive into women’s lives makes it 
inherently meaningful and important.
The showing in the Annex was the third 
time I’d seen Gerwig’s “Little Women.” 
Each time I’ve seen it, it has seemed deeply 
personal, probably because I now have this 
tight, almost inexplicable bond to the story. 
It has become some kind of constant, time-
less entity in my life, reminding me of why 
I write and why what I write is important. 
In some ways, it has become a part of me.
