On 
Saturday 
night, 
the 

Michigan football team had no 
business winning. The seventh-
ranked Wolverines made their 
own bed. Then they had to lie 
in it too.

Michigan’s 
performance 

wasn’t just sloppy. It was a 
heaping mess. The Wolverines 
threw 
three 
interceptions. 

They fumbled twice.

And despite all the chances its 

defense gave it, No. 7 Michigan 
fell, 14-10, to Michigan State 
(2-0 Big Ten, 4-1 overall) in the 
only night game in the rivalry’s 
110-year history.

“We 
had 
plenty 
of 

opportunities to move the ball, 
score touchdowns,” said fifth-
year senior quarterback John 
O’Korn. “How many turnovers 
did we have? Like five, six. You 
can’t expect to win when you 
turn the ball over that many 
times. And three of them were 
100 percent my fault.”

The first pick came with just 

under four minutes left in the 
third quarter. Michigan rushed 
for 31 yards on five carries, 
and looked to be building 
momentum. And yet, despite 
the success in the run game and 
the torrential downpour that 
had arrived in Ann Arbor, the 

Wolverines (1-1, 4-1) elected to 
pass.

On the next play, Spartan 

safety David Dowell picked off 
O’Korn. 
Michigan’s 
defense 

bailed him out with three 
straight stops.

On the next offensive drive, 

junior running back Karan 
Higdon rushed for seven yards 
in the middle of the offensive 
series. Then, the Wolverines 
passed 
again. 
O’Korn 
was 

picked off again, and Michigan’s 
defense bailed him out again. 

And with the rain coming 

down 
harder 
than 
ever, 

Michigan conformed to Albert 
Einstein’s definition of insanity. 
The Wolverines threw again in 
the downpour, and they got the 
same results. O’Korn threw his 
third interception of the game, 
and the defensive unit made up 
for his mistake once again.

“We were trying to run the 

ball. We were trying to piece 
drives together,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “We 
needed to score points and 
we needed to put some drives 
together. That’s what we were 
trying to do.”

Added 
O’Korn: 
“It 
was 

different at different points. 
There was one point where 
it was a torrential downpour 
and it was tough to throw the 

High profile business figures 

from Google, Microsoft and 
Walt Disney Studios spoke at the 
University of Michigan School 
of Information’s Bicentennial 
Symposium about the future 
of the University’s increasing 
technological global potential 
at Rackham Auditorium Friday 
afternoon. About 75 students 
and faculty attended the event.

The school, which began as 

the University Department of 
Library Science, was created 
in 1926 and was re-chartered 
as the School of Information 
in 1996. Since then, the School 
of Information has provided 
students 
with 
bachelor’s, 

master’s 
and 
doctorate 

programs 
in 
information 

studies with a wide realm of 
focus areas.

The School of Information 

teaches students how to apply 
digital technology to nearly 
every facet of society — social, 
cultural, 
commercial 
and 

political. Some main areas of 
study include data analytics, 
library and information science, 
human computer interaction 
and much more. The school 
offers bachelor’s, Master of 
Science, 
Master 
of 
Health 

Informatics and Ph.D. degrees.

Prior 
to 
the 
keynote 

conversation, seven School of 

Information 
professors 
and 

assistant 
professors 
gave 
a 

series of presentations on the 
current state of the School and 
showcased individual projects 
being spearheaded by students 
and faculty.

Projects 
included 
an 

application 
to 
report 
rat 

sightings in Ferndale and other 
cities 
around 
the 
country, 

research on the benefits of 
learning 
to 
program 
and 

engaging 
with 
computers 

and an effort to connect first-
generation college students to 
higher education through social 
media.

Associate 
Information 

professor Cliff Lampe, whose 
students 
researched 
and 

developed the interactive app 
Rat Chat, presented the civic 
engagement involved with the 
study. The app worked with 
Ferndale residents and asked 

them to text and report rat 
sightings in their city. The app 
then recorded the data and 
helped the city government 
completely 
understand 
the 

gravity 
of 
their 
city’s 
rat 

infestations.

Lampe 
said 
he 
learned 

how 
combining 
information 

studies with cities and local 
governments can bring societies 
into a new form of citizenship 

Amid 
an 
upset 
loss 
to 

Michigan State University on 
Saturday, game day saw a total 
attendance of 112,432 at the 
Big House and several security 
violations.

According to crime statistics 

sent to the Daily by Diane 
Brown, 
spokeswoman 
for 

the University’s Division of 
Public Safety and Security, 
there were four arrests — two 
for disorderly conduct, one 
for assault and one minor in 
possession charge.

Brown said in 2016, kickoff 

times play a big role in the 
number of incidents there are 
at games. She said games that 
start at 3:30 p.m. tend to have 
more enforcement action than 
games that begin at noon. 
In the case of last weekend’s 
matchup 
against 
Michigan 

State, kickoff was not until 7:30 
p.m. — thereby allowing more 
time for students to drink and 
tailgate.

Former Obama Administration advisors talked health care, 2018 election with Stabenow

The popular podcast “Pod Save 

America” stopped in Ann Arbor as 
part of their North American tour 
Friday night, where they put on two 
consecutive shows. The podcast 
featuring four of former President 

Barack Obama’s staffers has grown 
in popularity in recent months, 
particularly among young liberals.

In an interview with the Daily 

prior to the shows, the hosts 
discussed 
the 
importance 
of 

encouraging young people to get 
involved in politics and pushing for 
positive change.

Jon Favreau, host and former 

Obama speechwriter, said he hopes 
the podcast helps to inspire young 
people to participate in politics in 
any way.

“I think we are just trying to get 

young people to be excited about 
politics, be hopeful about politics. 
Try to let them know that it’s 
worth getting involved,” Favreau 
said. “Obviously, Donald Trump is 

president and things can be pretty 
bleak, but I think we’ve all been on 
campaigns and been in politics for a 
while, so some of the experiences we 
bring are letting people know that 
even though sometimes you lose and 
politics is frustrating and it seems 
like nothing is ever going to change, 
when people get involved, good

As “The Star-Spangled Banner” 

played before Saturday’s matchup 
against Michigan State University, 
a group of about 20 University of 
Michigan football players stood, 
arm-in-arm, to protest structural 
racism and societal inequality— a 
symbolic action part of the much 
larger 
#TakeaKnee 
movement 

currently spreading across the 
country.

The 
#TakeaKnee 
movement 

was created in response to former 
San Francisco 49ers quarterback 
Colin Kaepernick’s decision to 
kneel during the national anthem, 
a move that is believed to have 
prevented him from finding a job 
with another NFL team. Since 
then, many professional and college 
teams have echoed his statement by 
forming their own protests during 
the playing of “The Star-Spangled 
Banner”.

This game was the first time 

Michigan has taken the field since 
President Donald Trump made a 
series of remarks criticizing the 
NFL and the allowance of players to 
kneel during the national anthem.

CAMPUS EVENTS & NOTES

Report claims Gov. Snyder knew of 
Legionnaires’ in Flint before admission 

Bacteria-caused pneumonia one of many health effects associated with water crisis

Gov. 
Rick 
Snyder 
learned 

about outbreaks of Legionnaires’ 
disease in Flint one month prior 
to January 2016, which is when he 
publicly stated he was informed, 
according to the Detroit Free 
Press. Harvey Hollins III, one 
of Snyder’s aides, provided the 
information in a testimony on 
Friday.

Legionnaires’, 
a 
bacteria-

caused pneumonia, was one of 
the many fatal health effects of 
the Flint water crisis.

Hollins said he met with the 

Flint Water Advisory Task Force 
in December 2015 to address 
the alleged outbreaks; he then 
called the governor to inform 
him. However, in March of 
2016, Snyder told the U.S. House 

Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform that he held 
a press conference the day after 
he found out.

Public Policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel, 
communications 

director for the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Democrats, wrote that she was 
not surprised to hear of Snyder’s 
wrongdoing in a message to the 
Daily.

“The fact that Rick Snyder 

knew about Legionnaires in Flint 
in December 2015 and didn’t 
call a press conference until 
January 2016 isn’t surprising 
considering his poor handling of 
the crisis in general,” Schandevel 
wrote. “This is just another 
example of government failing to 
prioritize the health and safety of 
marginalized communities.”

The University’s chapter of 

College Republicans did not 
respond to requests for comment 

at the time of publication. 

According to the Free Press, 

Hollins said in his testimony that 
after learning the information, 
Snyder 
gave 
instructions 
to 

Richard Baird, one of his top 
aides, to contact Nick Lyon, 
director 
of 
the 
Michigan 

Department 
of 
Health 
and 

Human Services. 

Lyon 
is 
currently 
facing 

charges 
of 
involuntary 

manslaughter and misconduct 
in conjunction with the water 
crisis; the Legionnaires’ outbreak 
is crucial to his case. Lyon could 
face these charges for causing the 
death of an 85-year-old man, who 
was diagnosed with the disease.

Hollins’ testimony occurred 

during the fourth day of Lyon’s 
preliminary examination — now 
halted and set to continue Nov. 
1 — which will determine if his 
trial will proceed to the circuit 
court.

FINALLY FALL

from Rat Chat.

“Information 
tools 
and 

services can create new ways 
of 
collaborating 
with 
city 

governments and collaboration 
between 
citizens 
and 
cities 

or governments is really what 
citizenship is about,” Lampe 
said. 
“It’s 
about 
productive 

relationships and collaboration. 
We think information plays a 
huge role for that in the new 
digital future.”

On the academic side, assistant 

Information professor Steve Oney 
discussed why studying computer 
programming is a worthwhile 
endeavor past what the current 
occupational field looks like. He 
touched on how programming 
helps the modern world manage 
its online potential but a lack of 
accessibility is hurting the field’s 
future. He said tapping into the 
humanity of programming will 
make the field more accessible for 
those willing to learn.

“Programming tools need to 

not only scale up to handle more 
complex tasks that programming 
tools are mostly designed for, but 
they also need to scale down to 
make simple things easy to do,” 
Oney said. “In other words, we 
need to make programming more 
human.”

In a similar vein of social 

equality, Information professor 
Nicole Ellison presented her 
research on the cognitive impacts 
of social media on our concept 
of social capital. She related her 
research to how first-generation 
college students can use the 
massive web of social media to 
connect with college alumni. 
Ellison developed the app College 
Connect, with funding from the 
Gates Foundation, to show first-
generation students the resources 
they might not be aware of on 
their Facebook profiles.

Ellison said social media’s 

ability 
to 
do 
good 
should 

outweigh our criticism of the new 

technology.

“We shouldn’t really spend a 

whole lot of time worrying about 
why people are posting pictures 
of avocado toast on Instagram 
and rather really think about how 
we can use social media to benefit 
us and to make things happen 
and one of those things might 
be getting more first-generation 
students to place in colleges,” 
Ellison said.

The 
keynote 
panelists 

consisted of all University of 
Michigan alumni — Peter Lee, 
vice 
president 
of 
corporate 

research at Microsoft, Bradley 
Horowitz, 
vice 
president 
of 

product at Google, and Jamie 
Voris, chief technology officer at 
Walt Disney Studios.

To begin the panel discussion, 

moderator Thomas A. Finholt, 
dean of the University’s School 
of 
Information, 
asked 
the 

speakers for their predictions of 
technology in the next decade 
and century.

Horowitz’s future prediction 

discussed 
technology 
escape 

velocity — technology changing 
faster than society can absorb 
it. He also spoke on the relevant 
topics 
discussed 
in 
science 

fiction and how these are real 
possibilities for the future of 
technology.

“We get to see the collective 

societal thinking about where 
technology is going through 
science fiction,” Horowitz said. “ 
‘Black Mirror’ is looking at very 
near future scenarios — what 
happens when we can record 
every moment of our lives? How 
does that change things?”

Horowitz 
also 
related 

this 
notion 
to 
the 
student 

experience. 
The 
University’s 

future developments will greatly 
influence education, research and 
preparing future leaders. When 
hiring young employees in the 
technology industry, Horowitz 
considers a degree from the 
University of Michigan to speak 
to a candidate’s ability to get a job 
done.

Finholt asked panelists what 

they think are the essential skills 

students need today to achieve a 
tenured timeline.

Lee spoke about the issues 

surrounding losing touch with the 
purely curiosity-driven and open 
fundamentals of research that are 
in liberal forms of education. He 
further applied this idea to how 
bringing particular skills to the 
table can prepare students.

“It’s 
important 
to 
have 

an 
innate 
curiosity, 
open-

mindedness and an ability to 
work on a team of people,” Lee 
said. “I think that foundation is of 
a higher value to the future.”

Voris spoke about the special 

elements that the University of 
Michigan possesses in providing 
students with a well-rounded 
technological 
education. 

According to Voris, even in a 
career where you are the main 
player, having the tangibility of 
the University experience as a 
foundation allows students to 
continuously learn.

“I think from a research 

perspective, 
I 
think 
that 

partnership 
between 
the 

university 
and 
industry 
is 

incredibly 
important,” 
Voris 

said. “I think fundamentally the 
university experience, more than 
any specific piece of knowledge, 
is about learning how to learn.”

LSA 
freshman 
Dustin 

Stabinski, a preferred admissions 
student 
to 
the 
School 
of 

Information, said he felt excited 
about 
how 
these 
technology 

professionals believe currently 
stereotypical 
ideas 
of 
the 

future, such as “Black Mirror”, 
can become real possibilities. 
After attending this event, he 
felt 
reaffirmed 
in 
pursuing 

information studies and building 
a future for himself in the 
technology industry.

“I 
think 
this 
definitely 

reassured me of the information 
I want to go into because 
definitely being in a place where 
we’re socially not in the best 
place advancing towards the 
future, this gives us hope that 
as technology advances, there 
is definitely some positive out 
there.”

things can happen.”

Addressing 
recent 
racist 

incidents and subsequent protests 
on campus, Jon Lovett, co-host 
and 
another 
former 
Obama 

speechwriter, said he believes 
there is merit in pressuring 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

administration but also believes it 
is important to ensure the students 
feel safe on campus.

“I think there’s two parts to it. I 

think aiming some of the outrage 
at the college itself and at the 
University itself and pushing for 
a strong response is a really good 
idea,” Lovett said. “But ultimately 
it’s about everybody speaking out 
for a culture which treats people 
with respect and where people 
don’t feel as though … they can 
start writing racist things and 
think that that’s acceptable.”

Tommy Vietor, co-host and 

former National Security Council 
spokesman, encouraged students 
to get involved in whatever way 
they can and highlighting political 
groups such as Indivisible, Swing 
Left and College Democrats.

“I think after Trump got elected, 

people understood again what is at 
stake in these campaigns,” Vietor 
said. “The next step is helping 
people figure out how you can 
get involved, because it sounds 
complicated and it sounds hard but 
it’s actually really easy.” 

Lovett noted it is a unique time 

to be a student with Trump as 
president, but he again emphasized 
the need to get involved. 

“This is a really dark time. It’s 

actually a really unique thing to be 
coming of age and starting to really 
follow college a lot for the first 
time and see Donald Trump as 
president, that’s never happened 
before,” Lovett said. “And I think 
it can be discouraging because 
he’s our worst person, which is 
unfortunate. But at the same time 
there’s been this outpouring of 
activism that we’ve never seen 
before … People are engaged and 

active, and it’s not a silver lining, I 
don’t think that’s the right term for 
what’s going on, but there has been 
an equal and opposition reaction 
to what has been going on with 
Trump and being a part of that is 
important.”

During the show, the group 

discussed recent events including 
healthcare, 
new 
contraceptive 

guidelines 
and 
the 
newly 

uncovered links between white 
supremacy 
and 
Breitbart, 
a 

conversative media outlet. Sen. 
Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., also 
appeared in the middle of the show 
for a brief interview.

The 
Trump 
administration 

announced 
Friday 
it 
was 

rescinding 
Obama-era 
birth 

control mandate, which required 
employers to cover contraceptives 
in insurance plans. Ana Marie Cox, 
host of “With Friends Like These”, 
said the decision is important not 
just in the day-to-day impacts it 
will have, but also in the message 
it sends to women. 

“It’s consequential no matter 

what,” Cox said. “Because it sends 
a message to women primarily 
that you are not worth as much as 
men.”

On the same issue, Stabenow 

said she was disappointed in the 
decision and doubts Congress will 
take any action to reverse it.

“It’s terrible, and it’s just one 

more nail in the coffin in terms of 
trying to kill the ACA,” Stabenow 
said. “Unfortunately, the House 
and Senate, being in Republican 
hands, we are not going to be able 
to turn that around.”

Discussing the recent Buzzfeed 

article 
detailing 
direct 
links 

between 
white 
supremacist 

groups, 
Brietbart 
and 
Milo 

Yiannopoulos, 
former 
Senior 

White 
House 
Advisor, 
Dan 

Pfeiffer, co-host and Obama’s 
former communications director, 
expressed the danger in allowing 
publications with relations with 
white supremacist groups to be 
considered normal conservative 
media.

“Brietbart, which hangs out 

with Nazis, is in direct contact 

with them, as in rates Nazism, is 
now considered a mainstream 
conservative publication,” Pfeiffer 
said. “Mainstream media outlets 
cannot understand this because 
they have to immediately treat 
whatever is happening on the left 
as equal.”

On the subject of her rumored 

opponent in 2018, Robert Ritchie, 
better known as Kid Rock, 
Stabenow said she also played 
guitar in college and suggested a 
musical debate. 

“I actually worked my way 

through college playing acoustic 
guitar,” Stabenow said. “We may 
have to have dueling guitars, but 
we will wait and see. I love music 
and it could be very musical.”

Following 
Stabenow’s 

interview, Lovett imitated a game 
poking fun at Kid Rock and a 
specific tweet, which mocked 
Washington elites and praised his 
local state. Lovett asked his cohosts 
in the game to guess how much 
different items in the photo cost. 
Lovett concluded that the point 
of the game was that he believes 
Kid Rock would “campaign like 
Kid Rock but govern like Robert 
Ritchie.”

In the interview with the Daily, 

Lovett also stated his support for 
Michigan football ahead of the 
Michigan State game on Saturday.

“Obviously, 
I 
support 
the 

team from the campus that I am 
currently in. I am going to run for 
office,” Lovett said. “I support the 
Michigan team, the Wolverines. 
I love Harbaugh, the whole 
Harbaugh family.”

Ritam Mehta, an LSA senior, 

wrote in an interview with the 
Daily he is a fan of the podcast 
because of the lighthearted, yet 
important discusion of politics. 

“I think the show was a really 

good episode of the podcast. It 
includes a lot of good news analysis 
and talk about current events, 
which is why I like listening to 
the pod,” he wrote. “I also kind of 
idolize those four guys, especially 
Jon Lovett, who literally got a 
White House job because he’s 
funny.”

POD
From Page 1A

Mike Pence walked out on the 
Indianapolis Colts’ game against 
the San Francisco 49ers after a 
number of players took a knee in 
protest. He later tweeted he will 
not exalt any forms of protest he 
finds disrespectful to U.S. soldiers 
and the flag.

Demonstrations against racism, 

especially by Michigan student-
athletes, are not new. Last Fall, 

student-athletes raised fists or 
kneeled 
during 
the 
national 

anthem in almost every game, 
even when the cameras were not 
focused on them.

In an interview last year with 

the Daily, current LSA senior and 
cheerleader Priscille Huddleston 
explained why she decided to lead 
other athletes in raising their fists 
as a form of protest — emphasizing 
how her position as an athlete 
makes her more visible as an 
activist for social justice.

“It’s 
historically 
been 
the 

athlete’s position to empower their 
community,” Huddleston said. “It’s 
sparking conversations in classes. 
I only have a platform for four 
hours … I only matter in uniform, 
and I have to use that time and 
make it count. I have a block ‘M’ 
on and I’m not just supposed to 
wave a pom-pom and cheer you on. 
You can’t expect me to be silent. I 
didn’t understand how much of a 
platform I had until now.”

F

irst, it’s just a bit of 
light flashing in front 
of your eyes and a 

nebulous blue-black amoeba 
swimming in your 
vision. Then after 
a bit of clouding, 
your 
thinking 

begins to slow, with 
no particular pain. 
Your 
reactions? 

They’re 
just 
a 

millisecond behind. 
Your throw? Just 
slightly to the left. 
Your 
hearing? 

Just a bit muffled. 
Sometimes you stumble out 
of the area of play, wander 
over to put your head in 
your hands. Though it isn’t 
particularly painful, you’re 
taken aback by how dull 
everything feels, as if a fog 
descended over your face.

As 
someone 
who 
has 

experienced quick, powerful 
hits to the head in close 
succession, 
these 
are 
the 

immediate 
symptoms 
that 

arise. These types of hits to 
the head have brought about 
a commonplace discussion on 
the rise of Chronic Traumatic 
Encephalopathy 
cases 

reported in players of football, 
rugby, hockey, soccer and a 
variety of other sports.

CTE is a degenerative brain 

disease caused by a history 
of repetitive brain trauma. 
When too many hits are made 
to the head in one’s lifetime, a 
protein is produced in greater 
quantity than normal, causing 
the brain to deteriorate. It can 
lead to depression, psychosis, 
dementia and even death.

When 
Aaron 
Hernandez 

— the former New England 
Patriots football player who 
was convicted of murder in 
2015 — was diagnosed with 
CTE after his suicide, much of 
the world saw another reason 
to question football’s place in 
our society. Was the style of 
play too violent? Were there 
enough “checks and balances” 
to ensure player safety? Only 
27 years old when he died, 
Hernandez’s autopsy found 
he had already experienced 
very progressive CTE.

With such brain trauma, 

I 
certainly 
began 
having 

suspicions 
correlating 
his 

behavior 
to 
his 
diagnosis. 

From reports, his emotions 
fluctuated 
often, 
which 

certainly could lead to crime 
and 
suicide. 
Even 
more 

disturbing, previous players 
found with CTE were known to 
have erratic off-field behavior. 
I was taken aback that much 
of the CTE focus was directed 
at the sport. The demise of 
football 
isn’t 
the 
question 

we should be asking. CTE is 
opening the door to a realm 
of “neuroethics” that must 

be addressed; otherwise, our 
judicial system will be faced 
with an extreme ethics crisis.

A 
major 
aspect 
of 
the 

vast 
and 
quickly 

developing 
field 

of neuroscience is 
that it is still highly 
correlational. With 
that notion comes 
a 
foggy 
line 
on 

what brain patterns 
and 
chemical 

interactions 
exactly 
yield 

certain 
behaviors. 

Nevertheless, even 

without total and complete 
justification for the actions, 
its presentation has certainly 
already made its appearance 
in 
courtrooms 
across 
the 

nation. 
Since 
2005, 
the 

appearance 
of 
arguments 

based 
on 
neuroscience 
in 

courtrooms has more than 
doubled and is quickly rising. 
More importantly, it shows a 
major flaw in how we approach 
science in the courtroom.

John Oliver’s latest piece on 

forensic science highlighted 
this flaw, and it certainly has 
alluded to the neuroethics 
that should be highlighted 
in cases about CTE. The 
legal practice has progressed 
(in 
my 
opinion, 
through 

a realization of collective 
mistakes) 
developments 
in 

our society’s conscience that 
can be highly inconsistent and 
rather subjective. By contrast, 
the field of neuroscience is 
far more absolute, looking 
for concrete statements and 
conclusions based on highly 
developed 
and 
systematic 

approaches. 
I 
posit 
that 

we find the latter far more 
appealing, which is why, even 
with the fogginess in the 
correlation between behavior 
and 
neurological 
makeup, 

it is rather convincing to 
demonstrate that “science” 
is 
the 
reason 
why 
such 

abhorrent actions occurred.

The problem with CTE 

arising in the case of Aaron 
Hernandez 
might 
not 
be 

entirely obvious, but where 

exactly 
does 
one 
place 

blame? Is it the NFL? Is it his 
environment off the field? Or 
is assigning blame even what 
we should be considering? 

If someone does something 

abhorrent, 
certainly 
there 

must be some blame assigned. 
As a part of our societal 
makeup, too often I find the 
need to blame is written into 
our culture. Nevertheless, I 
counter that it might not be 
the best way to see “justice” 
in 
our 
legal 
system. 
As 

David Eagleman, a leading 
neuroscientist at Stanford, 
explains, “The choices we 
make are inseparably yoked 
to 
our 
neural 
circuitry, 

and therefore we have no 
meaningful 
way 
to 
tease 

the two apart. The more 
we 
learn, 
the 
more 
the 

seemingly simple concept of 
blameworthiness 
becomes 

complicated, and the more 
the foundations of our legal 
system are strained.” The rise 
in conversation surrounding 
CTE, and how the disease 
might have affected Aaron 
Hernandez’s behavior, will 
soon 
be 
confronted 
with 

questions of what and who to 
blame, and a collective debate 
must ensue.

Along with “blameworthiness,” 

another 
issue 
is 
that 
CTE 

— as well as many other 
brain disorders — are found 
only 
after 
the 
perpetrator 

was 
deceased. 
Certainly 

advancements in neuroscience 
technology 
might 
fix 
this 

issue, but at the moment 
it leaves a possible hole in 
how the legal arguments are 
framed and designed. When 
the 
perpetrator 
commits 

the crime, what activity in 
their youth could contribute 
to issues in brain function, 
leading them to commit a 
crime? Did they have a disease 
that has not been diagnosed?

With more flaws rising 

in the legal structure, the 
questions on CTE certainly 
make me question the future 
design of law. To address 
these 
issues, 
one 
must 

recognize that the law is 
currently 
designed 
as 
an 

adjustment to the present. 
The structure of our legal 
system is to take an issue that 
is presently occurring and 
push the discussion through 
the courts until the doctrine 
modifies to the norms. Let me 
suggest that the legal system 
begin questioning ways it 
can adjust its viewpoint from 
adapting to the present to 
developing for the future: 
to the questions of free will, 
what or who is to blame and 
what it means to be human.

R

ecently, U.S. Attorney 
Joon 
Kim 
dropped 

a 
bombshell 
on 
the 

college basketball world. Four 
assistant coaches from Power 
Five 
programs 
— 
Auburn 

University’s 
Chuck 
Person, 

the 
University 
of 
Southern 

California’s Tony Bland, the 
University of Arizona’s Emanuel 
“Book” 
Richardson 
and 

Oklahoma 
State 
University’s 

Lamont Evans — were charged 
in 
various 
cases 
involving 

corruption and bribery. Six 
other 
individuals, 
including 

an Adidas executive, financial 
planners and agents were also 
implicated. Federal authorities 
allege the men negotiated deals 
designed to illegally funnel 
recruits 
to 
specific 
college 

programs, then to agreed-upon 
apparel companies and agent 
services 
once 
the 
athletes 

turned professional. 

While some have been quick 

to point fingers at individuals 
and programs as roots of the 
problem, 
it’s 
the 
ultimate 

failure of the NCAA that has 
enabled such alleged rampant 
corruption to take place. Not 
only has the NCAA created a 
system that empowers higher-
ups to exploit college athletes, 
but its capability to efficiently 
regulate the system has proven 
borderline anemic.

Throughout 
its 
history, 

the 
NCAA 
has 
remained 

steadfast in its commitment to 
“amateurism” and the concept 
of a “student-athlete,” often 
taking unpopular measures to 
preserve their reputation. For 
instance, in the past month 
alone it suspended a Central 
Florida backup placekicker and 
a freshman Texas A&M cross-
country runner for using their 
athlete “likeness” to profit off 
their 
respective 
images 
on 

personal YouTube channels.

Such 
nitpicky, 
trivial 

rules have come under fire 
from players, coaches, fans 
and pundits alike. Even Jim 

Harbaugh, 
University 
of 

Michigan football coach, got in 
on the action after unknowingly 
committing a minor infraction 
in 
2015 
— 
dismissing 
the 

violation 
by 
quoting 
Oscar 

Wilde in a tweet that stated, 
“Thought of the day: ‘No good 
deed goes unpunished.’”

Concurrently, the landscape 

of collegiate athletics has been 
rife with scandals of massive 
proportion. 
Most 
recently, 

the University of Louisville’s 
basketball 
team 
employed 

strippers on recruiting visits 
(and 
subsequently 
forfeited 

the 2013 national title). And for 
decades, the Ed Martin booster 
situation has plagued the Fab 
Five’s legacy. There have been 
countless other cases which 
have highlighted the pervasive 
use of illicit recruiting tactics 
to garner commitments from 
high-profile players. Therefore, 
it was alarmingly ironic to 
hear William Sweeney Jr., the 
assistant director of the FBI’s 
New York office, refer to the 
Bureau’s Sept. 26 charges as 
contributing to “a ‘pay-for-
play’ culture that has no place 
in college basketball.” Clearly, 
such a culture has already 
manifested itself deep within 
the sport’s identity.

Unfortunately, this underbelly 

largely stems from the NCAA’s 
staunch 
unwillingness 
to 

allow athletes to tap into the 
billion-dollar 
college 
sports 

industry, 
thus 
generating 

incentives to facilitate back-
channel 
transactions 
with 

third parties. Because recruits 
cannot profit off their name by 
signing autographs, receiving 
a portion of jersey sales or any 
other endeavor that leverages 
their athletic status for financial 
gain, the door is wide open for 
organizations to capitalize on 
a player’s long-term potential 
by compensating them now. By 
making a relatively small bet, 
whether it be through a bribing 
a coach or directing payments 

to the recruit and his or her 
inner circle, companies can 
secure future gains with the 
promise of returning the favor 
in the form of lucrative apparel 
deals, sponsorships or mere 
association when the athlete 
eventually turns professional. 
Right or wrong, the unpaid 
collegiate system has produced 
this opportunity, and as long 
as it’s available, people will 
take advantage.

What’s more is that even 

with a system whose flaws are 
widely recognized, the NCAA 
has limited abilities in how it 
can actually pursue wrongdoing. 
As a private institution, it has 
no subpoena power or formal 
legal authority, thus severely 
hindering the extent to which it 
can acquire necessary and useful 
information to aid investigations.

This weakness was exposed 

by 
the 
FBI’s 
process 
of 

gathering facts to formulate its 
allegations. The FBI used a pro-
athlete financial planner who 
was close to the scandal “to get 
an undercover agent into hotel 
rooms, meetings and deals.” As 
a result, it was able to record 
intimate 
conversations 
and 

confidently implicate numerous 
figures. 
Such 
an 
operation 

is squarely outside the legal 
jurisdiction of the NCAA, and 
epitomizes its inherent inability 
to take necessary measures to 
purge the system’s offenders.

Therefore, 
though 
the 

ongoing FBI investigation may 
topple some notable coaches, 
programs and other entities, 
its implications may also have 
long-lasting effects. Perhaps 
when it’s all said and done, 
after realizing how much the 
system perpetuates a pay-to-
play and then fails to regulate 
it, people will finally demand 
real change in the NCAA. Until 
then, we can at least enjoy 
watching it crash and burn 
before our very eyes.

N

early two weeks after 
Hurricane 
Maria 

hit 
Puerto 
Rico, 

destroying much of its critical 
infrastructure — most notably, 
95 percent of the electrical 
grid 
— 
President 
Donald 

Trump 
visited 
the 
island. 

His statements there, which 
should have contained at the 
very least traces of empathy, 
were as ego-driven as usual.

Almost 
immediately 
upon 

arrival, 
he 
complained 
the 

territory 
had 
“thrown 
our 

budget a little out of whack” 
and lauded island officials for 
the relatively low death toll — 
which, at 16 deaths, was much 
lower than Hurricane Katrina’s. 

Later, he praised Ricardo 

Rosselló, governor of Puerto 
Rico, saying, “He’s not even 
from my party, and he started 
right 
at 
the 
beginning, 

appreciating what we did … 
Right from the beginning, this 
governor did not play politics. 
He didn’t play it at all. He 
was saying it like it was, and 
he was giving us the highest 
grades. On behalf of our 
country, I wanna thank you.” 

I’m not sure what complete 

failure of conscience causes 
someone 
to 
see 
a 
natural 

disaster in terms of “grades” 
or — as he did with U.S. Rep. 
Jenniffer González-Colón, the 
territory’s 
Republican 
non-

voting 
representative 
— 
to 

request further praise, now that 
he and the media were there:

“Jenniffer, do you think you 

can say a little bit (of) what 
you said about us today?” 
Trump asked. “And it’s not 
about me. It’s about these 
incredible people, from the 
military to FEMA to first 
responders. I mean, I’ve never 
seen people working so hard 
in my life. Perhaps you could 
say, congresswoman?” 

I’m not sure why, at this 

point, I find myself freshly 
disgusted with each instance 
of cold-blooded narcissism. 
What else, from a former 
reality television star? The 
drive to seek attention is 
threaded into the deepest 
parts of his personality and, 

for Trump, there has ceased to 
be a line too far. Everything — 
even a major natural disaster 
that affected more than three 
million U.S. citizens — is a 
chance to capture a few more 
seconds of media spotlight.

For some time now, I’ve 

debated whether or not the 
media’s critique of Trump is 
useful in any concrete way — 
if it’s actually accomplishing 
something, or if it simply 
exists to validate the opinions 
of 
people 
who 
have 
long 

since 
come 
to 
hate 
him. 

This particular instance of 
ineptitude, though, leads me to 
believe that the media has been 
forced into a role it hasn’t held 
since the advent of 24-hour 
cable news: that of an educator.

Much in the same way 

“The 
Learning 
Channel” 

stopped learning quite some 
time ago, our major cable 
news networks have drifted 
further 
and 
further 
from 

actual news. No one wants to 
pay for dry analysis and Wolf 
Blitzer reading sleepily from a 
teleprompter, but they’re more 
than willing when it’s coverage 
of scandal, the horserace or 
political squabbles.

Even 
our 
president 
isn’t 

immune to this effect. He 
reportedly loves the television, 
with 
the 
Washington 
Post 

estimating that, on an average 
day, he consumes five hours’ 
worth. 
Furthermore, 
unlike 

former 
Presidents 
Clinton 

and Obama, he watches it for 

current coverage of himself — 
not as an escape from it. Our 
media institutions are thus 
faced with the unfortunate 
task of educating the president 
through the only thing he has a 
sustained attention span for.

If President Trump prefers 

to 
receive 
intelligence 

briefings condensed to one 
page with “killer graphics,” 
it may be useful to take 
those lessons to heart when 
tweaking 
news 
broadcasts 

for 
one 
vitally 
important 

viewer. 
Commentators, 

instead of scoring unnecessary 
extra 
points 
with 
viewers 

who 
already 
share 
their 

political alignment, might try 
coaxing Trump into learning 
something. Fox News and CNN 
seem to have a united interest 
in ensuring that the president 
is minimally educated for the 
job, even if they have to go 
about it in different ways.

Cable news pundits rarely 

do 
original 
journalism, 

preferring to repackage the 
work 
of 
print 
journalists. 

They are thus enabled to 
participate in our national 
effort to soothe the president’s 
wildly 
unchecked 
ego 
by 

providing careful discussions 
that guide him toward more 
stable, researched positions. 
His advisers might not be able 
to make him read more than 
a page, but I certainly believe 
Sean Hannity, Wolf Blitzer and 
other journalists are capable of 
reading to him.

Whether 
it 
bruises 
our 

national pride or not, we owe 
it to Puerto Rico and those 
who will face similar and 
greater struggles in the future 
to make sure the president 
knows how to act in his office. 
With any luck, he’ll eventually 
internalize 
the 
ideas 
that 

people are not responsible 
for 
natural 
disasters, 
aid 

distribution is not a proper 
method of winning support and 
that we expect him to pursue 
praise through competence, 
not performance.

WARNER BROS.

‘Blade Runner 2049’ is a 
groundbreaking sequel

“Blade Runner” was a sci-

fi behemoth. Certainly, the 
movie has some uncomfortable 
moments 
and 
questionable 

demographic representations 
— all of the extras are Asian, 
yet 
no 
primary 
character 

is 
— 
but 
these 

shortcomings 
aren’t enough to 
delegitimize 
the 

masterpiece’s 
artistic triumphs. 
Even 
after 

three 
decades 

of 
filmmakers 

trying to replicate 
its 
intricacies, 

nothing 
has 

matched the visual creativity 
of 
Ridley 
Scott’s 
(“Alien: 

Covenant”) 1982 classic.

But this high praise doesn’t 

automatically 
warrant 
a 

sequel. The movie’s ending, 
ambiguous enough to keep 
us nerds debating for literal 
decades, doesn’t beg to be 
resolved 
in 
a 
follow-up. 

Replicating “Blade Runner” is 
a task too daunting for anyone, 
even Scott himself, to tackle 
— except for Denis Villeneuve 
(“Arrival”).

No other director could 

better 
guarantee 
that 
a 

“Blade Runner” sequel won’t 
horrifically disappoint. The 
French-Canadian 
visionary 

is 
on 
Hollywood’s 
hottest 

winning 
streaks, 
following 

the 
critical 
and 
popular 

adoration of “Sicario” and 
“Arrival,” two riveting and 
cinematographically stunning 
movies. With “Blade Runner 
2049,” the streak not only stays 
alive, but intensifies.

“Blade Runner 2049” is set 

30 years from the original and 
follows a similar plot. Hunting 
replicants is once again the 
main objective, but this with 
added 
complications. 
Agent 

“K” (Ryan Gosling, “La La 
Land”) is in charge of “retiring” 
— code for killing — replicants, 
or fake humans created by the 
Tyrell Corporation. But after 
finding 
suspicious 
objects, 

his job gets more difficult. 
Describing the rest of the plot 
is arduous, not only because 
it’s 
complex, 
but 
because 

every detail revealed is a mini-
spoiler. Scott and the movie’s 
producers cracked down on 
leaking any information before 
the release, which now makes 
sense. The whole movie leads 
you in one direction only to 
drag you back scenes later. 

And though you 
might get lost 
in 
the 
second 

act, it all wraps 
up neatly in the 
end.

Ryan 

Gosling’s 
performance as 
K is much like 
Harrison Ford’s 
(“Star Wars: The 

Force Awakens”) in the original 
— he balances a macho bravado 
with 
gaping 
vulnerabilities 

just like Ford’s Deckard. K 
struggles the entire movie with 
coping with his identity and 
his past. He lives an isolated 
life only to be accompanied by 
his AI girlfriend Joi (Ana de 
Armas, “War Dogs”). Without 
ever wandering into overtly 
highbrow 
territory, 
“Blade 

Runner” trudges through the 
nuances of existential dread 
and isolation. Much bleaker 
than the original — which is 
saying quite a bit — “Blade 
Runner 2049” is one of the 
darker 
dystopian 
tales 
in 

recent memory, and certainly 
of the blockbuster sci-fi genre. 

At 
the 
forefront 
of 

loneliness 
and 
isolation 
is 

K’s pseudo-relationship with 
Joi. He returns from work, 
not to a real human, but to 
an AI imaginary girlfriend 
programmed to make him feel 
loved. In this regard, “Blade 
Runner 
2049” 
definitely 

steals a bit from “Her,” but 
calling this theft isn’t valid. 
Joi isn’t quite as developed as 
Samantha, the AI from “Her.” 
However, the movie’s lazy 
one-dimension depiction of Joi 
is a social commentary in and 
of itself. This AI projection 
is manufactured to fit the 
stereotypical feminine roles 
in 
a 
masculine-dominated 

society: She’s a homemaker, a 
manic pixie dream girl and a 
cheerleader all at once. In this 
regard, the sequel definitely 
has a greater social conscience 
that its predecessor.

De Arma’s performance as 

Joi was likely the most difficult 
to 
execute, 
yet 
the 
most 

rewarding. Complemented by 
stunning CGI that glitches 
between accurate projections 
and stuttering malfunctions, 
her performance transcends 
Joi from being just another 
robot-type to a character we 
genuinely care about.

Villeneuve’s direction and 

Roger 
Deakins’s 
(“Skyfall”) 

cinematography are a match 
made in heaven. Incorporating 
the visual elements of the 
original 
while 
staying 

entirely authentic, the duo 
delivers breathtaking shots of 
dystopian Los Angeles. “Blade 
Runner 
2049,” 
in 
simpler 

terms, is one of the best 
shot movies of all time. It’s 
hypnotic, expansive, elaborate 
and 
gorgeous. 
Deakins, 

throughout his long and Oscar-
less career, has made Earth 
look like a different planet. He 
can take a typical landscape, 
and with his signature lighting 
and wide angle lenses, portray 
it as if it were some uncharted 
land. “Blade Runner 2049” is 
no exception. Los Angeles in 
2049 will probably not be the 
sunshine-deprived, billboard-
laden metropolis as seen in the 
movie, but Scott and Deakins’s 
world is one of the most 
detailed ever.

Die-hard fans will likely 

disagree, but “Blade Runner 
2049” 
is 
unnecessarily 

longwinded. Clocking in at 
163 minutes, it risks deterring 
viewers who either haven’t 
seen the original, or have and 
found it somewhat slow. Still, 
it’s about as good of a sequel 
as we could ever dream of, one 
that begs to be seen on the big 
screen.

Recent reboots of successful 

franchises, like “Mad Max: 
Fury Road” and “The Force 
Awakens,” have been instant 
classics in and of themselves. 
Suffice to say, we can expect 
many more of these to come.

The Wonder Years expand 
talents with new EP, show

The Wonder Years have had 

an impressive career arc since 
their inception in 2005. From 
their humble rise with the pop 
punk staple The Upsides to 
2015’s epic, moving No Closer to 
Heaven the band has grown at 
an exponential rate, selling out 
most of their shows to perform 
for a deafening fan base. But 
just over two weeks ago, The 
Wonder Years decided to toss 
us a curveball in the form of an 
acoustic EP titled Burst & Decay, 
which consists of toned down 
versions of seven of their songs.

In support of the EP, the band 

is currently finishing up a short 
run of full band acoustic shows, 
and I was fortunate enough 
to catch their hometown date 
in 
Philadelphia 
last 
Friday. 

Typically, The Wonder Years are 
known for high energy shows, 
largely thanks to the aggressive 
passion of their fans. At their 
acoustic shows, the band turned 
their typical formula on its head, 
replacing cathartic punk and 
alternative rock with intricate, 
tender compositions that beg 
more for quiet understanding 
rather than an explosive pit.

For the second time, I made 

a quick trip out to Philly to 
experience the band in their 
hometown. The Wonder Years 
performed to a sold out crowd 
at the Theater of Living Arts 

(or TLA for short), probably 
the largest venue on the entire 
tour. The atmosphere of their 
hometown 
shows 
is 
almost 

indescribable; the city clearly 
loves the band as much as the 
band loves the city that shaped 
them. 
Hearing 
their 
new 

acoustic rendition of “Coffee 
Eyes” in the city was achingly 
beautiful, whose chorus has 
frontman Dan Campbell yelling, 
“There’s always been a table for 
me here.” Singing along with the 
Philadelphians brought a sense 
of belonging unlike any other 
show of theirs.

While the crowd’s singing 

still 
(and 
probably 
always 

will) 
rivaled 
frontman 
Dan 

Campbell’s in terms of volume, 
the crowd as a whole was able 
to experience a vastly greater 
intimacy with the band’s lyrics. 
Replacing 
riffs 
and 
chords 

with synth lines and acoustic 
harmonies shifted the focus onto 
the words that Campbell sang. 
As acoustic renditions, the songs 
feel less finite and gut punching. 
Campbell expertly navigates his 
lyrics on these new versions, 
using soft croons far more often 
than his signature booming 
vocals.

In forcing the audience into 

this intimacy, every plucked 
guitar string and flowing synth 
note held a greater emotional 
weight. If anything, these new 
arrangements prove that The 
Wonder Years is a band of 
incredibly talented musicians. 
Their intimacy cast a spell across 

the crowd, one characterized by 
a captivating stillness previously 
unseen at the band’s shows. 
While these shows are marked 
by this impressive change of 
pace, impressive doesn’t really 
do 
the 
band’s 
performance 

enough justice. The Wonder 
Years 
completely 
exceeded 

expectations, proving that they 
have come a long, long way as 
musicians whose roots are in pop 
punk.

The Wonder Years took a 

leap of faith with this acoustic 
EP and tour, and Campbell 
acknowledged this at the show. 
The band is well aware of their 
usual 
expectations 
and 
just 

how much they subverted them 
in performing acoustic. Yet, 
this high risk came with high 
reward. By taking the time to 
rework old music with new 
musical 
composition, 
they’ve 

given their long time fans a 
reason to reflect and grow with 
the band. With these acoustic 
renditions and performances, 
the band has shown a capacity 
for growth and change that is 
essentially nonexistent in their 
contemporaries — time after 
time again, The Wonder Years 
have proven that they are so 
much more than just another 
pop punk band. In gearing up for 
the release of their sixth album 
in 2018, The Wonder Years could 
not have more perfectly gifted 
their fans than with a gorgeously 
arranged 
acoustic 
EP 
and 

small, intimate performances to 
showcase their reworkings.

FILM REVIEW
MUSIC REVIEW


Male friendship and the 
‘Neighbors’ conundrum

There’s a scene at the end of 

“Neighbors” that’s always bugged 
me. Zac Efron (“Baywatch”) and 
Dave Franco (“The Little Hours”) 
are best friends who have been 
fighting and growing apart over 
the course of the movie, but 
now Efron’s character is about 
to turn himself into the police 
to save his friends and they’re 
forced to make up. It starts out 
sweet, touching even. They tell 
each other they love each other 
(“I fucking love you man,” “I love 
YOU dawg”) and their eyes are 
welling over with tears. “I love 
you!” Efron says again. “That’s 
why I gotta go out there!” Franco 
starts bouncing up and down and 
screams “BE in this moment! 
Live in this shit with me!” They 
scream “I LOVE YOU!” and “I 
FUCKING LOVE YOU MAN” 
over and over again, both crying 
and hugging each other, to the 
point that Efron puts a stop to it. 
“Look, man, I love you and all,” 
he says, “but like, I’ve gotta go...
so....”

It’s a funny scene — Franco 

and 
Efron 
are 
both 
really 

good at embodying their frat 
bro personas while seeing the 
inherent humor in their macho 
posturing, and they’re talented 
comic actors. The music swells 
dramatically while the editing is 
lots of quick cuts between their 
two faces as they trade shouts of 
love at each other. Just bros being 
dudes, you know? It’s supposed 
to be funny, and it is. But my 
question is, why does this have to 
be funny at all?

Make no mistake: The butt of 

the joke is the fact that these are 

two big, handsome frat guys who 
are having a moment of genuine 
love, friendship and emotion. But I 
don’t know. I don’t know if there’s 
anything particularly hilarious 
about honest connection and 
friendship between two people 
who really care about each other. 
The only way to make that kind of 
thing funny at all is through the 
ironic, winking way the writers 
frame the scene. As if there’s 
something inherently unmanly, 
overemotional and embarrassing 
about the way they’re acting.

I can’t help but wonder how 

much more powerful that scene 
could have been if instead of 
shouting their declarations of 
love in an increasingly ridiculous 
affectation, the characters had 
looked each other in the eyes and 
said, “I love you. You’re my best 
friend.” And that would be that. 
No need to cover the feelings 
in layers of disingenuous irony 
and this inflated, self-conscious 
posturing.

I’ve seen this scene play out in 

so many movies and TV shows. 
There’s a whole episode in “New 
Girl” dedicated to Nick’s inability 
to accept Schmidt’s friendship 
and love, and it culminates in 
three men crying all over each 
other and confessing how much 
they care about each other. Only 
instead of playing the moment 
straight, the editing and framing 
(they all awkwardly walk away, 
clearly embarrassed) are telling 
us to laugh. Same thing in 
“Superbad,” and so many other 
contemporary comedies.

It’s a little heartbreaking. 

The message being delivered 
to young male audiences here 
is 
undeniable: 
Your 
feelings 

are 
funny. 
Your 
friendships 

are laughable. Your moments 
of honest connection are not 

masculine 
and 
need 
to 
be 

displaced and distanced from 
you with a good dose of self-
awareness and quippiness. Of 
course, it’s not like these movies 
exist in a vacuum — they’re 
reflecting the way we as a 
culture see masculinity and male 
friendships in the real world. But 
can’t our media be more than 
a mirror? Can’t we be a little 
aspirational? Why not hope for 
a kinder, more gentle world, one 
in which men can just tell their 
friends they love each other 
without being seen as effeminate 
or overemotional?

This isn’t a small thing, 

limited to a few late 2010s 
comedies. There are real and 
awful 
consequences 
to 
the 

reinforcement of this worldview. 
The undercurrent to all this 
is a belief that actions coded 
feminine (you know, little things 
like expressions of love, emotion 
and tenderness) are inherently 
embarrassing. It’s the belief 
that women are fundamentally 
inferior, and being seen as 
womanly is the very worst thing 
a man can be. Thinking this, 
holding it as true, growing up 
with it embedded deep in the core 
of who you are, it hurts people. 
It causes men to be angry and 
violent, and deeply, deeply sad.

I think we can do better. I 

think we can use our media to 
create better models of behavior, 
ones that are a little less incisive 
and clever, and a little more 
human. I think modern comedies 
can be hilarious and sharp and 
full of heart. I think men can find 
ways to be a little more gentle 
with each other. I really believe 
that — no irony, no distance, no 
posturing. We can all be a little 
more gentle with each other. This 
is a place to start.

Crocs and their unlikely 
comback in luxury retail

Distaste 
for 
Crocs 
once 

seemed 
like 
the 
absolute 

bottom threshold for sartorial 
taste. Now, the iconic mid-
aughts children’s shoe has been 
adopted by the elitist world of 
high fashion. British designer 
Christopher Kane prominently 
featured his take on the rubber 
shoe in his SS18 collection, 
a decision that was met by 
general praise by critics, and 
absolute horror by me.

If I could squelch one trend 

it would be high fashion Crocs. 
On the list of things the world 
needs, 
crystal 
encrusted 

Crocs round out the bottom. I 
would prefer to live in a world 
where the term “luxurious 
Crocs” 
remains 
exclusively 

oxymoronic. Prior to today, I 
thought just about everyone 
would want to stay in that 
relative-utopia, 
except 
for, 

maybe, Mario Batali.

Kane’s Crocs are neither 

innovative, nor clever, and 
frankly extremely ugly. Being 
fashionable does not necessitate 
looking good (nor should it), 
but this is ridiculous and also 
slightly bothersome. I find it 
generally distasteful when the 
fashion 
world 
appropriates, 

and marks-up, working-class 
items. Like the Moschino SS16 
collection, which was inspired 
by “tradesmen” and featured 
this take on high-vis workwear 
as well as the use of a traffic 
cone as a purse, which was sold 
for $1,195.

It’s 
unclear 
how 
much 

Kane will sell his new Croc 
designs for. But if they’re 
priced similarly to previous 
Croc collaborations (yes, that’s 
right, this collection is not the 
designer’s first dalliance with 
the the Croc brand), they’re 
likely to be quite expensive. 
Currently there is a pair of 
“slip-on Crocs clogs” being 
sold on the Christopher Kane 

website for $545.

For that price, you could buy 

20 actual Crocs, 180 jibbitz, or 
something that isn’t trash.

While Kane may have been 

the first major designer to 
collaborate with Crocs, he was 
not the last. Only two weeks 
after Kane sent his latest Croc-
collab down the runway, Demna 
Gvasalia of Balenciaga unveiled 
a pair of his own. It’s honestly 
hard to say which collaboration 
is worse, but I would give it to 
Balenciaga. The iconic French 
fashion house barely adapted 
the classic design at all, simply 
slapped on a platform.

It’s pretty shocking that 

two different designers would 
collaborate 
with 
the 
same 

third-party brand for a given 
season, but the fact that this 
brand is Crocs is absolutely 
insane. It’s too early to tell if 
the other major designers will 
hop on the Croc bandwagon, 
or if the trend will fizzle and 
die once more. I, for one, am 
rooting for the latter.

Wasting away

Michigan’s defense turned in 
another gem Saturday night, 

holding Michigan State to 

one first down in the second 
half. The offense, however, 

wasted it.

Until Saturday night, the 

formula — despite all of its 
inherent flaws — had worked 
well enough for Michigan. 

The 
seventh-ranked 

Wolverines 
would 
struggle 

to 
find 
their 

groove 
— 
usually 

due 
to 
multiple 

questionable 
mistakes — but they 
would find a way to 
turn it around in the 
second half en route 
to double-digit final 
scorelines. 

It 
had 
already 

worked four times. 
But sometimes even 
the smallest crack 
can cause a ship to 
sink. 

Against 
Michigan 
State, 

as 
heavy 
rain 
turned 
into 

a 
torrential 
downpour, 

Michigan’s ship didn’t just sink. 
It capsized.

The Wolverines had faced 

halftime deficits before. In their 
season opener against Florida, 
they headed to the locker room 

at AT&T Stadium with a 17-13 
deficit. But then they scored 20 
points in the second half and 
didn’t concede a single one, 
ultimately winning, 33-17.

And in its conference opener 

against 
Purdue, 

Michigan 
entered 

halftime at Ross-Ade 
Stadium trailing, 10-7. 
Then the Wolverines 
scored 
21 
points 

without conceding any 
and pulled off a 28-10 
win.

Those 
scorelines 

didn’t 
reflect 
the 

full scope of either 
game. Still, Michigan 
maintained a zero in 
its loss column. Their 
struggles 
could 
be 

hidden behind the curtain of 
victory. 

But 
Saturday 
night, 
the 

Wolverines lost their first game 
of the season to the unranked 
Spartans in the first night game 
of their 110-year rivalry. Now, 
there is nowhere to hide.

The 
first 
half 
against 

Michigan State was the worst 
one yet. At the start, though, 
it didn’t seem as though that 
would be the case. 

Michigan opened the game 

on its 25-yard line, and moved 
down the field with ease. With 
a balanced attack courtesy of 
junior 
running 
back 
Karan 

Higdon, 
sophomore 
running 

back Chris Evans and fifth-
year senior quarterback John 
O’Korn, the Wolverines drove 
64 yards to the Spartan 11-yard 
line, taking up almost half of the 
first quarter in the process. But 
when they needed to seal the 
deal, their red-zone woes came 
back to haunt them and they had 
to settle for a 30-yard field goal. 

Despite 
the 
offensive 

letdown, 
Michigan’s 
defense 

did what has become routine 
for the No. 1 unit in the country. 
The Wolverines didn’t allow 
Michigan State to gain a single 
yard, forcing a three-and-out 
after only a single minute of 
possession. 

Michigan’s offense had the 

ball back with another shot at 

the end zone. After gaining 19 
yards on the ground in three 
plays, the Wolverines looked 
ready to capitalize on their 
second opportunity. But at the 
very end of that final run, the 
Spartans poked the ball out of 
the arms of fifth-year senior 
running back Ty Isaac and 
recovered it. This time, it was 
Michigan’s drive that lasted for 
only a minute.

Michigan State took over at 

the Wolverines’ 46-yard line 
and used just six plays to make 
it into the end zone first. 

After the Spartans scored 

another 
touchdown 
in 
the 

second quarter, Michigan had 
one more chance to answer 
back before the end of the first 
half. But O’Korn’s 36-yard pass 
to sophomore tight end Sean 
McKeon was wiped out by yet 
another forced fumble, and the 
Wolverines headed to the locker 
room at Michigan Stadium with 
a 14-3 deficit. 

Though 
the 
double-digit 

deficit was the largest margin 
Michigan had to come back 

from this year, its prior success 
in the second half seemed to 
bode well.

“I don’t think we really 

struggled, you know, we were 
4-0,” said senior linebacker 
Mike McCray. “But it’s a game. 
You can’t be perfect every time. 
The outcome is we want to win. 
It doesn’t matter how we get it.”

At the start, it seemed as 

though that would be the case 
again. After Michigan State 
fumbled a punt and had to start 
at its own two-yard line, the 
Wolverines’ defense forced a 
three-and-out 
and 
Michigan 

had the ball at the Spartans’ 
33-yard line. The Wolverines 
took full advantage of the 
favorable field position, using 
just four plays to score their 
first touchdown of the game.

But all it takes is one changed 

variable to render a formula 
obsolete. 
Right 
after 
that 

touchdown, 
the 
rain 
came 

pouring down.

And with it came a string of 

bad decisions on the offensive 
side of the ball. Instead of 

consistently running the ball 
to counteract the troublesome 
weather, 
Michigan 
elected 

to pass on three consecutive 
possessions. 

On each of those drives, 

O’Korn threw an interception. 

“It was tough for me to see,” 

O’Korn said. “I was just trying 
to buy time and just put it up.”

Though the Wolverines had 

other opportunities, they never 
found their second-half magic.

Michigan’s defense held up its 

end of the bargain, preventing 
the Spartans from putting any 
more points on the board. But 
amid strong winds and steady 
rain, the offense couldn’t find 
its footing. 

The Wolverines may have 

been able to bounce back from 
concerning starts before, but 
Michigan should have taken it 
as more of a warning sign. 

Flaws in a formula that 

happened to be good enough for 
four wins are still flaws. And 
on Saturday night, the Spartans 
made it clear: the Wolverines’ 
formula is not a winning one.

The monkey on Jim Harbaugh’s back

T

he answer provided 
little clarity. 

Jim Harbaugh was 

asked for his reaction to his 
current record against Michi-
gan State 
and Ohio 
State, 
fresh off 
a rain-
soaked 
grudge 
match 
that saw 
his then-
seventh-
ranked 
Wolverines lose, 14-10.

“I don’t know,” he said. 

“We’re bowing our necks, get-
ting ready for the next game. 
That’s our reaction.”

The fact is, though, that 

it’s a fair question to ask after 
Saturday night. After all, it’s 
one of the only ones left unan-
swered after he has brought 
Michigan back to national 
prominence. But for the first 
time since he arrived in Ann 
Arbor, fans were given reason-
able cause to doubt what the 
outcome of Harbaugh’s grand 
vision for the program will be. 

Tim Drevno may be the 

offensive coordinator and Pep 
Hamilton may be the passing 
game coordinator, but this is 
Harbaugh’s offense.

And that offense didn’t just 

sputter, as it has all season. 
Saturday night, it came to a 
screeching halt.

It was the lowest scoring 

output of Harbaugh’s tenure. 
The Wolverines posted 4.1 
yards per play. They averaged 
just 2.6 yards per carry. They 
ran 40 different formations 
in the first half, according to 
Michigan State coach Mark 
Dantonio, to the tune of just 
three points.

As for the second half, it was 

an unmitigated disaster.

Michigan completed less 

than 50 percent of its passes, 

and after torrential rains hit 
Ann Arbor midway through 
the third quarter, it became 
baffling why Michigan was 
throwing so much in the first 
place. As for the most offen-
sive instance — the Wolverines 
dared to go five-wide from the 
shotgun on third-and-short 
early in the fourth quarter.

In the Wolverines’ first 

drive after the storm started, 
they appeared to adopt the 
logical approach. Junior run-
ning back Karan Higdon got 
the ball four times, giving 
Michigan two first downs on 
23 yards.

Then the Wolverines called 

three straight pass plays. The 
third became fifth-year senior 
quarterback John O’Korn’s 
first interception.

On the next drive, Michi-

gan ran the ball once for a 
yard. O’Korn was sacked, 
then completed a screen pass 
to sophomore tight end Sean 
McKeon for 12 yards. After 
an incomplete pass, Higdon 
rushed for seven yards. But on 
third-and-three, O’Korn was 
picked again.

During the following offen-

sive possession, the Wolver-
ines clearly didn’t learn their 
lesson. After an incomplete 
pass and another one-yard 
rush, the Spartans nabbed 
their third interception in as 
many possessions.

And if the play calls weren’t 

questionable already, who was 
on the field for them was. The 
Wolverines stuck to their run-
ning back rotation, despite the 

fact that Higdon was clearly 
their most effective rusher.

Sophomore Chris Evans 

averaged negative yardage on 
four second-half carries. Isaac 
did the same with two. Hig-
don, on the other hand, aver-
aged 5.9 yards on eight carries.

After the game, Harbaugh 

said himself that it was fair to 
criticize the play calling. He 
said that Michigan was trying 
to run the ball. The in-game 
product said otherwise.

He said that the Wolverines 

were trying to piece drives 
together. They failed by a long 
shot.

As for Michigan’s offen-

sive unit, it said all the right 
things. They wouldn’t lean on 
the weather as a crutch, and 
yet there was an underlying 

truth to their answers.

“It was different at different 

points,” O’Korn said. “There 
was one point where it was a 
torrential downpour and it was 
tough to throw the football, 
but there’s no excuses. You’ve 
gotta do what you’re coached 
to do and you have to complete 
the passes that are called.”

Added fullback Khalid Hill: 

“I mean, the gloves weren’t 
even helping. We had gloves 
that we can wear to help with 
the rain. Those were drenched 
by the time we was going on 
the field. The rain played a big 
part, but still … the mistakes 
that we made also played a big 
part.”

That they did, and now 

Michigan would need to win 
out to concretely improve upon 

the last two years — a daunting 
task given that the Wolver-
ines still need to travel to No. 
7 Wisconsin and No. 3 Penn 
State before facing the ninth-
ranked Buckeyes at home.

Make no mistake, the Sat-

urday night’s outcome is in no 
way grounds for a coaching 
change. It wasn’t long ago that 
Harbaugh resurrected a pro-
gram that finished 5-7 before 
his arrival.

But on the last play of the 

game, O’Korn took the snap 
on first-and-10 at Michigan 
State’s 37-yard line. He danced 
around the pocket and sent 
a prayer to the end zone in a 
game that the Wolverines had 
plenty of opportunities to win 
far earlier.

As the ball hung in the air, 

those who stayed through a 
torrential downpour held a 
sliver of hope that this time, 
the Michigan football team 
would end up on the right side 
of a miracle at Michigan Sta-
dium.

Seconds later, they were left 

sorely disappointed. Donovan 
Peoples-Jones had a chance, 
but that was all it was. Three 
Spartans surrounded him in 
coverage, and the ball hit a 
mass of eight hands all clawing 
at the chance to put their team 
on the right side of a rivalry. 
The ball hit the turf.

Those who stayed, well, they 

were left to watch as Michigan 
State rushed the field. They 
were left to watch as the Wol-
verines walked off it, heads 
bowed in disappointment.

More than anything, 

though, they were left with 
this stark reality: Jim Har-
baugh is now 1-4 against the 
Wolverines’ two biggest rivals, 
and he was outcoached Satur-
day night.

football, 
but 
there’s 
no 

excuses. You’ve gotta do what 
you’re coached to do and you 
have to complete the passes that 
are called.”

But there was, at the very 

least, one too many mistakes.

In the first quarter, the 

Wolverines 
were 
driving, 

threatening to score twice in as 
many drives to open the game. 
Fifth-year senior running back 
Ty Isaac was given the ball 
on first-and-10 near midfield. 
He failed to protect the ball, 
though, and Michigan State’s 
Joe Bachie forced a fumble that 
the Spartans recovered.

Michigan State quarterback 

Brian Lewerke rushed for a 
14-yard touchdown to cap off 
a 46-yard drive following the 
fumble recovery, and later found 
Madre London on a screen in 
the second quarter. The junior 
running back coasted to the 
corner of the end zone to take a 
14-3 lead at Michigan Stadium.

For a fleeting moment, it 

looked like Michigan would 
reclaim a grip on the game 
before the half concluded — the 
same one they had on the first 
offensive and defensive series 
of the game.

O’Korn 
found 
sophomore 

tight end Sean McKeon for a 
36-yard reception that would 
have put Michigan on the 
Spartans’ 27-yard line with 
31 seconds to play. Instead, 
McKeon 
fumbled, 
and 
the 

Wolverines went into halftime 
trailing by 11.

Michigan managed to reach 

the end zone with just over 
eight minutes left in the third 
quarter to cut Michigan State’s 
lead to four.

But the rest of the game was 

the byproduct of carelessness, 
and the Wolverines didn’t score 
another point.

Michigan turned the ball 

over too much, even for its 
defense 
to 
counteract. 
It 

adopted a nonsensical game 
plan, as rain poured down in 
sheets.

Now, Paul Bunyan is going 

back to East Lansing, and the 
Wolverines have no one to 
blame but themselves.

GAME
From Page 1A
The good, the bad and the ugly: Michigan State

It was a long night for the 

Michigan football team.

Under the lights at Michigan 

Stadium for the first time in the 
history of the in-state rivalry, the 
now-17th-ranked Wolverines lost 
their illustrious unbeaten status 
in a 14-10 loss to Michigan State. 
Saturday night, Michigan dropped 
a game it should never have been in 
a position to lose to the unranked 

Spartans — putting its College 
Football Playoff aspirations on life 
support in the process.

As 
a 
torrential 
downpour 

engulfed 
Ann 
Arbor, 
the 

Wolverines couldn’t climb out of 
the hole they had dug themselves 
into during the first half. The Daily 
breaks down the good, the bad 
and the ugly from Saturday night’s 
game.

The good
On 
a 
night 
when 
almost 

everything went wrong, Michigan’s 

only 
redeemable 
quality 
was 

the performance of its stalwart 
defensive unit.

As has been the case throughout 

the 
season, 
whenever 
the 

Wolverines have faltered, their 
defense has swooped in to save 
the day. But against Michigan 
State, there was simply too much 
overcome.

The 
defense 
was 
spread 

thin all game, forced to spend a 
considerable amount of time on the 
field due to a number of mistakes on 
the offensive side of the ball.

Though the defense gave up 

two touchdowns in the first half, it 
would shut the door in the second 
half, not conceding a single point 
after the break.

The opening score could be 

chalked up to favorable field 
position. On Michigan’s second 
offensive drive, fifth-year senior 
running back Ty Isaac fumbled the 
ball, and the Spartans recovered it 
at the Wolverines’ 46-yard line. 

The second score came down 

to a fortunate 30-yard completion 
and a well-executed screen pass. 
Spartan wideout Darrell Stewart 
Jr. caught a deep ball that had 
been tipped by senior cornerback 
Brandon Watson, and Michigan 

State quarterback Brian Lewerke 
caught 
Michigan’s 
defense 

completely off guard on a 16-yard 
trick play.

The one noticeable shortcoming 

on the defensive side of the ball was 
that the Wolverines failed to record 
a sack after leading the nation in the 
category prior to the contest.

The bad
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

summed it up after the game: “Too 
many turnovers.”

As it turned out, Isaac’s fumble 

was only the beginning of the 
Wolverines’ 
troubles 
Saturday 

night. Michigan turned the ball 
over a total of five times against 
the Spartans, including another 
fumble and a whopping three 
interceptions.

Worse yet, all three picks came 

in consecutive possessions in the 
second half. After the rain had 
begun to pour down, it would have 
been expected for Michigan to 
transition its game plan accordingly 
and rely more heavily on the run 
game. Suffice to say, that’s not what 
happened.

The Wolverines tested fate 

by electing to keep throwing 
the ball, and then suffered the 
consequences. Fifth-year senior 
quarterback John O’Korn threw 
three straight interceptions.

At 
that 
point, 
Michigan’s 

comeback attempt lost all of 
the steam it had gained from its 
touchdown drive halfway through 
the third quarter.

In a game that ultimately came 

down to a four-point differential, 
the Wolverines shot themselves 
in the foot one too many times to 
escape unscathed.

The ugly
There is a lot that could go in 

this category, but the overriding 
sentiment from this game is that, 
yet again, Michigan lost a rivalry 
game to Michigan State in front of 
a home crowd.

With the wounds from 2015’s 

infamous fumbled punt still fresh 
in the minds of Wolverine fans, 
this game was supposed to be 
redemption.

Despite 
the 
fact 
that 
the 

Spartans were unranked while 
Michigan was No. 7 — in contrast to 
when Michigan State was No. 7 and 
the Wolverines were ranked 12th — 
their respective rankings went out 
the window with the Paul Bunyan 
trophy on the line.

Despite taking home a victory 

in 
East 
Lansing 
last 
season, 

Michigan’s win seemed to be 
overshadowed by the Spartans’ 
2-5 record at the time. This year 
was the win the home crowd really 
wanted.

That’s why the student section 

stuck it out through the storm 
as the rain drenched them from 
head to toe. They eagerly awaited 
a chance to ease the pain many of 
them had suffered in that same 
student section two years ago.

The Wolverines delivered yet 

another disappointment instead.

Wolverines split weekend in upstate New York

The 
resourcefulness 
of 

Michigan hockey’s special teams 
Friday night earned it a victory 
in its season opener against 
St. Lawrence. Finding the net 
on two of five power plays, 
the Wolverines’ performance 
mimicked last season’s dynamic 
power-play offense that finished 
17th nationally.

But just a day later, that 

same offense looked starkly 
different.

Inefficiency on the power play 

was the downfall of Michigan 
(1-1-0 overall) in its Saturday 
matchup with Clarkson. The 
Wolverines couldn’t convert on 
any of their eight special teams’ 
chances. The failure to do so 
was glaringly displayed in two 
of 
Michigan’s 
opportunities, 

which happened to be five-on-
three advantages.

“When you don’t score any 

goals, it’s hard to win a hockey 
game,” said Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson. “But it’s a process and 
it’s going to be a process with 
this team.”

Despite 
outshooting 
the 

Golden Knights (2-0-0) 29-19, 
Michigan found itself in this 
exact 
offensive 

predicament. 
Falling 
to 

Clarkson 
in 

the 
Saturday 

nightcap halted 
the Wolverines’ 
chance 
for 
a 

weekend sweep, 
and 
resulted 

in 
Michigan 

splitting 
its 
opening 

weekend.

“We’re going to have to 

continue 
working 
on 
our 

special teams, especially five-
on-threes,” Pearson said. “We 
haven’t had a lot of opportunities 

to work on those, and I think you 
could see that tonight a little bit. 
But those are huge momentum 
swings in the game, and if we 
can score one on that, then we’re 
right back in.”

While no puck found the 

back of the net Saturday, the 
Wolverines 
certainly 
didn’t 

make it an easy night for Golden 
Knight goaltender Jack Kielly. 
The 
sophomore 
netminder 

recorded 29 saves throughout 
regulation. Michigan brought 
an energized attack Friday as 
well, recording 27 shots against 
the Saints (0-2-0).

The penalty kill — a focal 

point 
during 
practices 
this 

week — was another strong 
suit for the Wolverines on their 
New York road trip. Michigan 
prevented goals on all four of St. 
Lawrence’s power plays Friday, 
and went 5-for-6 on penalty 
kills against Clarkson.

Preventing 
the 
opposition 

from scoring on power plays was 
just one asset of the Wolverines’ 
blue 
line 
this 
weekend. 

Michigan’s defense also held its 
opponents to relatively low shot 
counts.

“We definitely made some 

improvement 
defensively,” 

Pearson said. “You know, to 

only give up 18 
shots to a team 
like Clarkson … 
is a good sign for 
our defense. And 
our goaltenders 
might 
want 
a 

little more work, 
but we’re trying 
to limit the shots.

“I 
thought 

it was a good 
defensive effort 

(Saturday night). A lot of blocked 
shots, a lot of guys sacrificing 
their body to make a difference.”

As could be anticipated in 

an opening weekend, Michigan 
also had its fair share of firsts.

Pearson, who has officially 

begun his first season as head 
coach of the Michigan hockey 
team, kicked off his tenure with 
the win against St. Lawrence. 
Additionally, his first loss came 
Saturday 
against 
Clarkson, 

splitting his first weekend.

Sophomore 
goaltender 

Jack LaFontaine earned his 
first win of the season in the 
opener, racking up 24 saves 
against the Saints on Friday 
night. Sophomore netminder 
Hayden Lavigne also saw his 
first official start this season 
Saturday against the Golden 
Knights, recording 16 stops on a 
19-shot night.

On the other end of the ice, 

freshman defenseman Quinn 
Hughes and graduate forward 

Alex Roos netted their first goals 
for the Wolverines against St. 
Lawrence. Hughes notched his 
first 
collegiate 

goal on a power 
play 
early 
in 

the 
second 

period, 
while 

Roos 
scored 

Michigan’s third 
and 
final 
goal 

about 
midway 

through 
the 

third.

The 
only 

opposing 
goal 

was scored by forward Alex 
Gilmour in the second period, 
but wasn’t enough to combat 
Michigan’s two-goal lead.

Hughes 
and 
Roos, 
in 

combination 
with 
another 

power-play goal from senior 
forward Tony Calderone, led the 
Wolverines to their eventual 3-1 

triumph over the 
Saints.

Saturday’s 

results differed 
from that of the 
St. 
Lawrence 

game 
and 

weren’t 
what 

Michigan 
had 

hoped 
for. 

Clarkson scored 
two goals in the 
first period, one 

of which was the result of a 
power play from a Roos hooking 
penalty. A third and final goal 
was scored for the Golden 
Knights in the second period by 
defenseman Terrance Amorosa 

to finalize the 3-0 score early in 
the game.

However, a high shot output 

and 
resilient 
defense 
were 

positive assets in the Wolverines’ 
performance, regardless of the 
game’s outcome.

And those efforts certainly 

didn’t go unnoticed.

“We knew Clarkson was a 

good hockey team coming in 
here,” Pearson said. “You know, 
they’re ranked ahead of us … 
and it’s hard to be on the road. 
But I liked our stay with it, 
that’s one of the positives I can 
take out of this. We stayed with 
the game plan, we kept pushing, 
we kept working. We just didn’t 
get any puck luck (Saturday). 
And some nights, it’s just going 
to go that way for you.”

Michigan overpowers Rutgers in dominant win

Coming 
off 
a 
nail-biting 

win against Penn State last 
Sunday, the Michigan men’s 
soccer team had a more routine 
Friday night, overpowering a 
struggling Rutgers team, 3-1. 

Michigan (4-1-1 Big Ten, 

7-3-2 overall) came out strong, 
creating 
opportunities 
early 

and often. Rutgers (0-6-0 Big 
Ten, 
2-9-1 

overall) 
gave 
way 

to 
the 

Wolverines’ persistence, as the 
deadlock broke after just seven 
minutes. 
Junior 
midfielder 

Robbie Mertz dribbled into 
the box before sliding the ball 
to find junior midfielder Ivo 
Cerda for the tap-in finish.

Michigan continued to push 

numbers forward and carve 
out scoring chances. Twelve 
minutes after Cerda scored, 
freshman forward Mohammed 
Zakyi played a perfect ball 
junior 
forward 
Francis 

Atuahene, who fired a shot back 
across the goalkeeper to extend 
the Wolverines’ lead to two.

“It was good. It set the bar 

high, and gave the defenders 
a little bit of relief,” Atuahene 
said. “The earlier you score 
goals the more confidence you 
gain.”

Added 
Michigan 
coach 

Chaka Daley: “Any time you 
score two goals early at home 
you want to ride the wave. 
We had a great crowd and the 
Ultras were here. We had to 
battle some minor elements, but 
they were here in full voice and 
it certainly pushes our team on 
when the Ultras are here.”

Toward the end of the first 

half, momentum shifted in 
favor of the Scarlet Knights. 
Michigan 
looked 
a 
bit 

complacent and was sloppy in 
possession. A foul near midfield 
gave Rutgers a set piece, of 
which they took full advantage. 
Rutgers forward Ryan Peterson 
beat sophomore goalie Andrew 

Verdi with a well-placed header 
off a cross from 40 yards out.

Michigan went into the half 

up 2-1, outshooting Rutgers 
12-6 in the first 45 minutes. 
But 
the 
Wolverines 
knew 

adjustments still had to be made 
in 
the 
second 

half 
to 
regain 

momentum.

“It was a soft 

goal from our 
standards,” 
Daley said. “We 
talked 
about 

at 
halftime 

how we set the 
standard, 
not 

the opponent. If 
you don’t live up 
to it, it has to change.” 

The 
Wolverines 
certainly 

responded 
to 
their 
coach’s 

challenge.

Rutgers 
had 
just 
three 

shots in the second half, and 
Michigan was able to tally 
another eight. The Wolverines 
pressed 
forward 
and 
both 

Zakyi and Atuahene had good 
chances, but it was the junior 
forward who put Michigan up 
by two just 11 minutes into the 
second half.

Atuahene 
was 
the 
best 

player on the field for the 
entire game. He tallied seven 
shots, including three shots on 
goal, and two goals in attack. 
His speed on the wing caused 
Rutgers problems all night.

“Both guys were really sharp. 

They 
started 
really 
lively,” 

Daley said. “They were deadly. 
They were effective, and they 
held the ball well.” 

Added Atuahene: “We have 

a game plan every 24 hours 
before the game. We all relax 
and try to stay away from any 
distractions on campus. We 
focus and come back to the field 
and try to execute our game 
plan.” 

Daley was pleased with the 

way his front three played all 
night, and he attributed that 
success to recovery from recent 
injury problems.

“We’re healthy in the front. 

All four guys were healthy,” 
Daley said. “I think those four 
guys on their day individually 
can 
carry 
the 
group, 
but 

collectively they’re certainly a 
handful. We were just too much 
tonight for Rutgers to handle.” 

Michigan 

improved 
upon 

its 
best 
Big 

Ten start since 
2013, 
moving 

into 
second 

and 
only 
one 

point back from 
conference-
leader 
Maryland.

And 
as 
the 

pieces continue 

to fall into place only one year 
after a disastrous season, the 
Wolverines can’t help but enjoy

“It feels really good. It’s been

Defense deserves better

I

t’s no secret at this point.

Michigan’s defense 

is good enough to win a 

championship.

Football, though, is a team 

game — as 
fifth-year 
senior 
linebacker 
Mike 
McCray 
alluded 
to after 
his team’s 
14-10 loss 
to Michi-
gan State.

“(When 

the) offense (is) doing bad, we’re 
doing bad,” he said. “We can’t 
get frustrated with them; they 
can’t get frustrated with us.”

It’s the type of answer you’d 

expect from McCray, the con-
summate teammate who was 
elected captain before the sea-
son.

Deep down, though, you won-

der if there is any frustration 
from him, or from any other 
member of the defense. And if 
there is — that’s easily under-
standable.

In the second half — before 

an eight-play, 26-yard drive that 
took just enough time off the 
clock to make life even more 
difficult for the Wolverines on 
their final drive of the game — 
the Spartans had the ball seven 
times.

The results of those seven 

possessions? Six three-and-outs 
and one four-and-out after they 
elected to go for it on fourth 
down.

It was the definition of abso-

lute dominance from Michigan’s 
defense — the type of outing 
that we’ve become accustomed 
to seeing with Don Brown call-
ing the shots.

And yet that Herculean 

performance wasn’t enough, 
because as absurdly good as 
Michigan’s defense was, the 
offense simply could not exe-
cute.

After the game, McCray said 

that coming out of halftime, 
his unit’s goal was to give the 
offense the ball as many times 
as possible.

Here’s what the Wolverines 

did with those eight posses-
sions: three-and-out, 33-yard 
touchdown drive, interception, 
interception, interception, punt, 
punt and a desperate 43-yard 
drive that ended with the ball 
harmlessly falling to the turf.

It was a sight for sore eyes, 

and it was a sight that will haunt 
Jim Harbaugh and his offensive 
coaching staff for the rest of the 
week, perhaps for the rest of the 
season. This, after all, was an 
easily winnable game — and the 
Wolverines even had the blue-
print for doing so.

Coming out of halftime faced 

with a 14-3 deficit, Michigan 
began a war of field position. 
The defense kept the Spartans 
pinned deep, and when a Jake 
Hartbarger punt was returned 
to the Michigan State 33-yard 
line, the Wolverines pounced.

After yet another three-and-

out forced by the defense, the 
offense looked poised to build 

on its prior success. Michigan 
fed junior running back Karan 
Higdon four consecutive times, 
and he turned those carries into 
23 yards and two first downs.

And then the Wolverines 

tried to pass.

They were called for hold-

ing. They called another pass, 
and O’Korn scrambled for eight 
yards. They called another pass 
— and O’Korn threw it to the 
other team.

“When we got momentum 

going,” Harbaugh said, “we 
turned it over.”

Michigan stuck with the pass 

stubbornly, like a puppy might 
do with an old chewed-out toy. 
It called for passes even amidst 
what O’Korn deemed a “torren-
tial downpour,” which certainly 
didn’t make life any easier for 
him. And it got the same result 
nearly every time — a bad one.

The Wolverines ran 13 pass 

plays in the second half before 
a desperate final drive where 
Michigan State played things 
safe and allowed easy comple-
tions underneath. On those 13 
plays, O’Korn completed four 
passes. He was sacked and 

forced to scramble once each. 
He threw three interceptions.

O’Korn, as good of a team-

mate as any, didn’t give much 
away after the game.

“I wasn’t upset with any of 

the calls at all,” he said. “I was 
just upset with myself.”

But, like with the defense, 

any frustration would’ve been 
understandable. After all, he 
himself commented on the diffi-
culty of throwing in the rain.

There’s merit in debating 

whether the players simply have 
to execute, or whether they 
were put in a position to suc-
ceed Saturday night. There are 
now many more questions than 
answers facing this team after 
such a dispiriting loss. 

And yet, one thing was dev-

astatingly clear: Michigan’s 
defense deserves better.

“You can’t expect to win,” 

O’Korn said, “when you turn the 
ball over that many times.”

Truer words have never been 

spoken.

Junior wide receiver Grant Perry was part of a Wolverine offense that let its defense down Saturday night.

FOOTBALL
Offensive line fails ‘M’

Fifth-year senior quarterback 

John O’Korn scrambled from the 
pocket all game long — rolling left, 
rolling right and running up the 
middle. He gained 24 yards on the 
ground.

The problem for the No. 7 

Michigan football team (1-1 Big 
Ten, 4-1 overall) was that O’Korn 
was never supposed to rush.

“None of them were designed 

runs,” O’Korn said of his many 
scrambles. 
“They 
were 
all 

pass plays. Guys weren’t open, 
(Michigan State) had good coverage 
or protection broke down.”

The struggles appeared most on 

the offensive line, where Michigan 
couldn’t contain the Spartans’ 
pressure. The Wolverines lost the 
battle in the trenches, and duly lost 
the game, 14-10.

Midway through the second 

quarter, Michigan State defensive 
end Kenny Willekes burst through 
the offensive line to sack O’Korn. 
Willekes had lined up to the 
left, matching up with redshirt 
sophomore right tackle Nolan 
Ulizio.

Ulizio was beat, and O’Korn was 

taken down.

After Ulizio’s struggles, the 

coaches subbed him out for 
redshirt junior Juwann Bushell-
Beatty. The substitution wasn’t 
part of the original game plan, 
according to coach Jim Harbaugh, 
but the coaches felt that they had to 
make a change.

However, 
nothing 
really 

changed.

O’Korn was sacked again before 

halftime — Michigan State’s third 
sack of the second quarter. By the 
end of the game, the Spartans had 
sacked O’Korn four times for a total 
of 33 yards.

Ulizio and Bushell-Beatty split 

the duties Saturday. Despite plenty 
of options at the position — redshirt 
sophomore Jon Runyan has also 
appeared there — few have seemed 
to work.

“Those two guys — Juwann and 

Nolan — they compete their butts 
off,” said senior left tackle Mason 
Cole. “They’ll continue to do that. 
Our coaches will put the best guys 
out there. Whether it be Nolan 
in the first half or Juwann in the 
second half, it doesn’t matter.

“We trust Nolan out there. We 

trust Juwann out there. Doesn’t 
matter to us.”

But it should matter. The right 

tackle position has been Michigan’s 
weakest link this season. The 
offensive line struggles go from left 
to right.

Cole, a veteran and the offensive 

captain, lines up out left and 
is one of Michigan’s strongest 
players. Next to him at left guard is 
sophomore Ben Bredeson, another 
highly-touted lineman who molded 
well to the college game.

At center is fifth-year senior 

Patrick Kugler, who came off the 
bench in the past few years, and 
finally earned a starting role. To 
the right of Kugler is sophomore 
Michael Onwenu, the Wolverines’ 
best option at right guard.

And then comes right tackle. 

Nobody has proven themselves as 
the worthy starter. Cole and other 
teammates talked about how Ulizio 
and Bushell-Beatty keep competing 
— just as they did through spring 
training and fall camp.

Yet after all this time, neither 

has separated from the pack, and 
it’s showing. O’Korn simply isn’t 
getting much time to pass.

“Protection all this year has 

been a big focus for us,” Cole said.

Cole and O’Korn stood by their 

teammates, but it’s clear that the 
position is contributing to the 
issues of an already dysfunctional 
offense.

The offensive line broke against 

the Spartans, and it is hard to 
foresee an improvement when 
Michigan still has to play Penn 
State, Wisconsin and Ohio State.

“Part of it is on me,” O’Korn 

said. “I’ve got to get us in the right 
protection.”

A small part of it is on O’Korn. A 

bigger part of it is on the offensive 
line.

Five Things We Learned: Michigan State

Talk about a season killer. 
It’s 
hard 
to 
imagine 
No. 

17 Michigan (1-1 Big Ten, 4-1 
overall) competing for the Big 
Ten Championship — or the 
College Football Playoff — after 
No. 21 Michigan State came out 
victorious in the night game this 
weekend.

The 14-10 loss revealed what 

many expected would happen 
at some point in the season: The 
Wolverines’ offensive struggles 
would catch up to them, and 
Michigan would dig itself a hole 
that was too big to crawl out of.

Here are five things we learned 

from the Wolverines’ loss on 
Saturday.

1. Michigan can’t just rely on 

its defense

Once again, Michigan’s defense 

— the top-ranked unit in the 
country in yards allowed per game 
with 213 — shut down its opponent 
in the second half. The Spartans 
didn’t tally a second-half first 
down until their final drive of the 
game.

The Wolverines failed to get a 

sack for the first time this season, 
but tallied three quarterback 
hurries.

Two sophomores, cornerback 

Lavert Hill and safety Josh 
Metellus, 
combined 
for 
four 

pass breakups and played a big 
part in holding Michigan State 
quarterback Brian Lewerke to just 
98 passing yards.

Michigan shut Lewerke down 

after halftime, but there was little 
the defense could do to help when 
the offense turned the ball over 
five times.

2. 
O’Korn’s 
performance 

against Purdue might not be 
representative

Two hundred and seventy 

yards, a touchdown and a 69 
percent completion rate? That’s 
what O’Korn threw for when he 
came off the sideline to replace an 
injured Wilton Speight two weeks 
ago against Purdue.

Expecting him to perform 

that well every weekend, though, 
might not be fair.

While Speight’s efforts were 

criticized left and right in the 

beginning of the season, Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh continued to 
back up his decision that Speight 
was the team’s best option at 
quarterback. When Speight went 
down, it was tough to imagine how 
the Wolverines would respond.

Reasonably though, Michigan 

fans were less worried after 
O’Korn lit up the Boilermakers, 
hitting his receivers and tight ends 
the entire afternoon.

But 
against 
the 
Spartans’ 

lockdown coverage, the fifth-year 
senior and transfer from Houston 
couldn’t produce like he had the 
week before.

O’Korn 
completed 
just 
38 

percent of his passes and gave 
up three interceptions. O’Korn’s 
best throw of the game came on 
a 17-yard pass to junior receiver 
Grant Perry, who landed on 
Michigan State’s one-yard line.

3. The offensive line struggles 

are the source of the problem…

Redshirt 
sophomore 
Nolan 

Ulizio got the start at right tackle. 
After he got beat on a second-
quarter 
sack, 
redshirt 
junior 

Juwann Bushell-Beatty replaced 
him, but Bushell-Beatty was not 
any more effective.

The struggles at the position 

gave O’Korn little time to work 
in the pocket, as Michigan State’s 
pressing defense continued to 
break through the offensive line.

O’Korn was sacked four times 

and only passed for 86 yards in the 
second half. If the offensive line 
can’t create gaps or protect the 
quarterback, there isn’t enough 
time for any components of the 
offense to get to work.

4. But the receivers are 

struggling too

On the third-to-last play of the 

game, sophomore receiver Eddie 
McDoom dropped a wide open 
pass 
from 
O’Korn. 
Michigan 

would’ve been at the Spartans’ 
31-yard line with 21 seconds left, 
but McDoom couldn’t reel in the 
catch.

O’Korn connected with four 

receivers in the second half, 
throwing for just 86 yards after 
the break.

Junior Grant Perry has stepped 

up as Michigan’s leading receiver 
since freshman Tarik Black’s 
season was cut short due to a foot 
injury. But other receivers like 
freshman Donovan Peoples-Jones 
and sophomore Kekoa Crawford 

just haven’t made a big impact.

The Wolverines needed big 

plays to swing momentum, but 
they never got any and couldn’t 
overcome their errors.

5. Not-so-bold Prediction: 

The Minnesota game probably 
won’t be at night

The Nov. 4 game between 

Michigan 
and 
Minnesota 
is 

the only home game left on the 
Wolverines’ schedule that does not 
yet have an announced time for 
kick off.

The game against Michigan 

State was held at night due to the 
national attention it would receive. 
It had all the dimensions to be an 
instant classic: the in-state rivalry, 
a highly-ranked team and the first 
time the Spartans came to Ann 
Arbor since the botched punt.

A game against Minnesota 

won’t have any of those factors. 

And after this first loss, it’s 

tough to imagine the Wolverines 
beating No. 3 Penn State on the 
road in two weeks. If Michigan 
is 6-2 going into a matchup with 
the irrelevant Golden Gophers, a 
national television network will 
have no desire to air that game on 
primetime.

VOLLEYBALL
Wolverines plagued 
by inability to finish

With 
the 
Michigan 

volleyball 
team 
(2-4 
Big 

Ten, 
12-6 
overall) 
facing 

match point against No. 6 
Minnesota, 
senior 
outside 

hitter Adeja Lambert tracked 
the ball, soaring into the air 
and connecting her hand to 
the ball with sheer force. 

Her spike flew straight into 

the net.

She looked down at the 

floor in disappointment as 
the Golden Gophers’ cheers 
washed over the otherwise 
quiet 
Cliff 

Keen Arena.

Suddenly, 

Michigan had 
lost its third 
set — and the 
match.

Saturday 

afternoon, the 
Wolverines 
were 
swept 

by 
No. 
6 

Minnesota 
(4-2, 14-2), losing 25-21, 25-21, 
25-20. It was their first home 
loss of the season.

Despite 
the 
sweep, 

Michigan appeared to have 
victory in its clutches in all 
three sets. It held several 
large leads, including a 17-12 
advantage in the first set and 
a seemingly insurmountable 
16-8 
lead 
in 
the 
second 

set. 
For 
large 
stretches, 

the 
Wolverines 
looked 

tremendous, dominating one 
of the best teams in the nation.

But the Wolverines never 

capitalized on those leads.

“We have to get better,” said 

coach Mark Rosen. “We don’t 
have to get monumentally 
better, but we’ve got to get 
better. Especially when it 
really matters — in the crunch 
points, at key times.”

Toward the ends of sets, 

Michigan 
wilted 
while 

Minnesota flourished.

In the first set, Minnesota 

won six of the last seven 
points.

In the third set, the Golden 

Gophers scored the last five 
points.

These 
two 
massive 

runs were both fueled by 
a 
combination 
of 
stifling 

defense from Minnesota, who 
stuffed the Wolverines with 
14 blocks, and what Rosen 
called 
a 
one-dimensional 

Michigan attack.

“We’ve got to have more 

options and use more options,” 
Rosen said. “I thought we 
did that early on in sets but 

I think when it 
got late, we got 
a 
little 
more 

predictable.”

There 
were 

moments, 
though, 
when 

the Wolverines 
did utilize their 
role 
players 

well, 
such 
as 

senior opposite 
hitter Katherine 

Mahlke.

Mahlke’s 
left-handed 

strikes added a much-needed 
variety 
to 
the 
Michigan 

attack, temporarily confusing 
the 
Minnesota 
blockers. 

Midway through the second 
set, she pounded a kill down 
the middle of the court to 
halt a seven-point run for the 
Gophers. Mahlke had three 
kills on just four attempts, 
leading the Wolverines with 
an excellent attack percentage 
of 0.750.

However, her performance 

was indicative of her entire 
team’s performance — good, 
but not good enough.

Going 
forward, 
Rosen 

believes he can solve his 
team’s late-game issues.

“Balance is gonna be really 

important 
for 
us 
moving 

forward,” he said. “That’s 
what’s gonna help us close 
games out.”
