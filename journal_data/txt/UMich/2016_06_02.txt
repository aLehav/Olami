Overcrowding and 
underfunding lead 
to mental health 
issues in inmates 

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Summer News Editor

On the night she hung herself, 

Janika Edmond asked her guards 
at the Huron Valley Correctional 
Facility for a suicide prevention 
vest, according to her family’s 
attorney David Steingold.

Edmond was 25 years old and 

was nearly finished serving time 
for violating parole following 
past 
convictions 
of 
assault, 

breaking 
and 
entering 
and 

resisting police officers. Records 
from the Michigan Department 
of Corrections (MDOC) and 
Steingold show Edmond spent 
her sentence dealing with clinical 
depression, bipolar disorder and 
suicidal thoughts, all of which 
were the aftermath of a deluge 
of 
emotional 
and 
financial 

problems she experienced as a 
child.

Steingold went on to detail 

Edmond’s request on Nov. 2, 2015, 
for the suicide prevention vest — 

a bulky smock with straps known 
as a Bam Bam suit — and prison 
guards’ 
dismissive 
reactions. 

He even referenced a bet placed 
by prison staff members on the 
likelihood of Edmond’s success 
in receiving a vest.

Just 20 minutes later, Edmond 

was found hanging in a shower 
area with pieces of underwear 
tied around her neck. Washtenaw 
County vital records confirm she 
was pronounced dead at a nearby 
hospital four days later on Nov. 6. 

Steingold said though he is 

not able to comment on the exact 
details of Edmond’s death, its 
causes are clear.

“Her death was occasioned 

by improper action of the prison 
and its employees,” he said. 

Two 
corrections 
officers 

were fired over the incident 
this March, and as Steingold 
gathers evidence in preparation 
for a lawsuit against MDOC, 
the Michigan State Police is still 
conducting an investigation into 
the death, which has not yet been 
officially declared a suicide. 
Edmond, however, was just one 
of 33 suicide attempts at Huron 
Valley in the last year alone, and 
she was just one of 2,287 women 
packed inside the facility, which 
is set to receive more offenders 

despite the fact that it’s already 
more than 100 inmates above 
capacity. 

This year alone, the prison 

has been in the news for stories 
such as women being housed 
in converted break rooms and 
offices, rationing sanitary pads 
and a double amputee inmate 
forced to crawl to shower areas. 
Though 
Edmond’s 
end 
may 

have been exceptional, many 
claim her experiences suggest 
common, endemic problems of 
overcrowding and inadequate 
inmate 
resources 
at 
Huron 

Valley.

Lack of Resources
MDOC 
spokesman 
Chris 

Gautz emphasized that prison 
officials are working to alleviate 
issues of overcrowding. Since 
a November Detroit Free Press 
article exposed the prison for 
housing women in offices and 
TV rooms, Gautz said officials at 
Huron Valley have devoted more 
time to carving out space for 
more inmates.

“We’re dealing with the space 

we have available at Women’s 
Huron Valley,” Gautz said. “We 
had to, in some housing units, 
convert 
areas 
that 
weren’t 

traditionally cells, and we’ve 
been able to take a few of those 

offline. We also created a new 
housing unit in a newer area of 
the facility that had about 90 
beds. It’s a situation we continue 
to monitor daily.”

Many critics are still not 

satisfied. Birmingham attorney 
Lynn Shecter, on behalf of 
three Huron Valley inmates, 
sued the state in a class action 
suit in April on claims that the 
overcrowding violated inmates’ 
basic constitutional right against 
cruel and unusual punishment. 
The suit, still under preliminary 
consideration by state courts, 
alleges the three inmates spent 
up to 23 hours with multiple 
cell partners in confined spaces. 
Shecter emphasized that her 
clients’ 
experiences 
are 
not 

isolated. 

“We 
keep 
hearing 
the 

same story again and again,” 
Shecter 
said. 
“When 
we 

distributed a survey to find out 
if (overcrowding) is a universal 
problem at Huron Valley, we 
discovered it is. And this has 
an effect on the mental health 
and attempts to rehabilitate 
prisoners.”

Huron Valley’s population has 

jumped by more than 17 percent 
in the last five years, though the

Second day of annual 

Mackinac Policy 

Conference focuses 

on DPS

By CALEB CHADWELL and 

KEVIN BIGLIN

Daily Staff Reporters

Focus turned to Detroit and 

its public schools at the Detroit 
Regional Chamber’s Mackinac 
Policy Conference on Wednesday, 
with a panel on DPS and a keynote 
address from Detroit Mayor Mike 
Duggan, in which DPS was a 
subject of his discussion. 

Panelists 
Dan 
Quisenberry, 

president 
of 
the 
Michigan 

Association 
of 
Public 
School 

Academies, and John Rakolta Jr., 
chairman and CEO of Walbridge 
and co-chairman for the Coalition 
for the Future of Detroit School 
Children, debated DPS reform in 
general and the place of Michigan 
Senate Bill 710-711 within it.

The bill was introduced by 

state Sen. Geoff Hansen (R–Hart) 
in January with the purpose of 
establishing a temporary five-year 
Detroit Education Commission 

to oversee reforms and provide 
money to repay the district’s 
$515 million debt. The legislation 
passed the state senate in March 
with a bipartisan vote and the 
support of Gov. Rick Snyder (R), 
but it did not pass through the 
state House of Representatives.

Both parties agree that major 

reform in Detroit Public Schools is 
needed. About 19,000 elementary 
students in Detroit currently 
attend schools with less than five 
percent reading at a fourth grade 
proficiency level, according to MI 
School Data. Additionally, the 
district has run a deficit for 16 of 
the last 17 years. 

“We all have the goal of 

increasing academic outcomes for 
kids,” Quisenberry said. “We also 
have the goal of improving access 
to quality schools across the city 
of Detroit.”

Rakolta favored the legislation 

because 
he 
believes 
the 

commission created under the 
bill would ultimately improve 
classroom conditions and help 
control finances.

“If we don’t fix this in Detroit, 

we’re going nowhere,” Rakolta 
said. “There is no discipline in our 
system.”

Quisenberry, 
on 
the 
other 

hand, opposed the bill because 
he believes it calls for too much 
governance. 
He 
prefers 
that 

the performance be improved 
by existing leaders within the 
district, rather than politically 
appointed individuals, and called 
for people on his side to not be 
afraid to make new and different 
proposals.

“What 
we 
want 
is 

performance,” Quisenberry said. 
“Why do we assume that this 
(Bill 710-711) will have a positive 
impact on students’ outcomes? 
Will a D.E.C. (Detroit Education 
Commission) manage attendance 
issues across the city? Can a 
D.E.C. respect and handle the 
diversity of the Detroit issues? 
I don’t see how a D.E.C. can do 
that.”

Rakolta responded by stressing 

that the current leadership within 
the district is failing. He touted 
proposed bills as the best option, 
especially given the bipartisan 
support it has received within the 
state senate and from community 
leaders.

“Whatever we have today isn’t 

working, and we can’t wait any 
longer,” Rakolta said. “The D.E.C. 
is the best hope and it is supported

Warrior Scholar 

project helps 

students returning 

from service 

By KEVIN LINDER

Daily Staff Reporter

For the third summer since 

2014, the University of Michigan 
hosted 
the 
Warrior-Scholar 

Project, a week-long summer 
program that provides veterans 
with 
assistance 
during 
the 

transition from military life to 
higher education.

Founded at Yale University 

in 2012, the program expanded 
to both the University and 
Harvard University in 2014. This 
summer, it will be hosted by 12 
different 
universities 
across 

the country. In Ann Arbor, 
the program was hosted at the 
Mosher-Jordan Residence Hall. 
Students sleep, eat and study 
from 9 a.m. Sunday morning 
to late Saturday evening. This 
year’s cohort of 27 veterans at 
the University represented the 
largest group ever to participate 
in the program.

Upon leaving the service, 

one of the challenges that many 

veterans face when they leave 
the service — which the Warrior-
Scholar Project seeks to address 
— is a lack of preparation for the 
transition directly into a collegiate 
environment.

The veterans enrolled in the 

program take part in classes 
designed to improve critical reading 
and writing skills. After breakfast, 
students attend seminars led 
by volunteer professors from 
the University, and later in the 
day, they participate in reading 
classes in which they analyze 
the ideas and arguments made in 
challenging texts from authors 
such as Alexis 
de Tocqueville, 
Thucydides 
and Plato. The 
students 
also 

take 
writing 

classes, 
led 

by 
full-time 

tutors, in which 
they learn to 
effectively develop a thesis and 
present arguments.

The program is designed to 

help students who are planning 
to attend college in the future, but 
it’s also open to students who feel 
they need additional academic 
assistance following a couple of 
semesters of enrollment.

Program 
Director 
Ryan 

Pavel, a Marine Corps veteran 
and University alum, said the 
program is very humanities-
focused, yet is also designed to 
aid students with all types of 
interests and needs.

As the organization grows, 

there 
are 
plans 
to 
further 

incorporate STEM-based skills 
into the program. According to 
Pavel, Yale University and the 
University of Oklahoma offer 
additional week-long programs 
to students who want to pursue 
STEM degrees.

Pavel also said the work 

students do through the program, 

and 
the 
way 

the 
program 

is 
designed, 

prepare 
students for the 
challenges and 
expectations of 
fields 
outside 

of 
higher 

education 
as 

well.

“We 
are 
trying 
to 
start 

conversations about these study 
skills,” Pavel said. “Being a good 
student helps you anywhere. 
Knowing how to approach a 
complicated text helps you in 
anything; the skill of knowing 
how 
to 
approach 
and

North Carolina 
style legislation 

introduced in state 

senate

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

The Michigan state legislature 

is 
attempting 
to 
join 
North 

Carolina in passing a bill that 
would 
require 
transgender 

people to use the bathroom that 
corresponds with the sex listed on 
their birth certificate. State Sen. 
Tom Casperson (R–Escanaba) is 
sponsoring the bill and is firmly 
set on legalizing it despite the 
apparent obstacles and media 
firestorm North Carolina is facing.

North Carolina, the first state 

to successfully restrict which 
public 
bathrooms 
and 
locker 

rooms transgender people use, 
sparked 
headline 
news 
and 

strong opposition from LGBTQ 
rights advocates, and the state 
is currently facing many legal 
battles regarding the bill. LGBTQ 
rights advocates filed a lawsuit 
against the law’s legality, and 
the federal government ordered 
North Carolina to abolish the law 
as it violates federal civil rights, 
leading to a lawsuit against North 
Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) by 
the Department of Justice.

Despite 
President 
Barack 

Obama 
cutting 
billions 
of 

dollars in federal aid from North 
Carolina, Casperson will continue 
to advocate for the bill and wishes 
to stop children from sharing a 
bathroom with others who are 
“biologically different.” Casperson 
decided to introduce the bill after 
discovering that the State Board 
of Education stated in a proposed 
reccomendation 
that 
public 

schools should allow transgender 
students to use the bathrooms 
with which they identify, as 
well as being referred to by the 
pronoun of their requests.

This 
proposition, 
however, 

didn’t 
sit 
well 
with 
the 

Republicans in Lansing, including 

House Speaker Kevin Cotter, who 
also spoke out against the board’s 
recommendation. Cotter said in 
a statement that he is protecting 
the wishes of parents who may 
not have approved a gender switch 
concerning their child.

“Maybe there’s something there 

that’s just not normal,” Casperson 
said. “And normal’s not the right 
word. Maybe there’s something 
there that’s just not right, where 
we’re mixing these kids together.”

The proposed bill is already 

receiving 
backlash 
similar 
to 

the comments made in North 
Carolina. 
A 
public 
comment 

section 
already 
has 
7,000 

responses and comments, mostly 
in opposition to the measure. 
John Austin, president of the State 
Board of Education, is an active 
force against this bill. Austin said 
that the bill could violate federal 
civil rights and further isolate 
these transgender students who 
are already at-risk for suicide, 
depression and bullying.

The bill is also facing opposition 

from state Democrats. U.S. Rep. 
Dan Kildee (D–Mi.) released a 
statement condoning what he is 
calling the Anti-LGBT Bathroom 
Bill. Kildee pointed out that 
Casperson and other Republicans 
are willing to spend time and 
money on such a divisive issue 
rather than focusing attention 
on issues such as improving 
infrastructure, ensuring funding 
for the public schools and safe 
drinking water in Flint.

“Their ‘bathroom bill’ ... is 

discriminatory 
and 
bigoted,” 

Kildee said in a statement. “It 
seeks to divide Michiganders and 
deny people access to restrooms 
when they simply want privacy, 
safety and respect when using 
such accommodations. Michigan 
Republicans 
like 
Senator 

Casperson should spend less time 
bullying Michiganders and more 
time on the actual problems facing 
our state. This hateful bill flies in 
the face of Michigan values like 
dignity, equality and respect, and 
it should be promptly shelved and 
defeated.”

Controversial new 
bathroom bill affects 
transgender students

“Being a good 
student helps 
you anywhere”


T

his election cycle has seen 
a carousel of hot topics 
ranging from whether 

we 
should 

accept Syrian 
refugees 
to 
which 

bathrooms 
individuals can and can’t use. In 
this series of debates, one thing 
that has become increasingly 
clearer is that the United States 
may be facing a polarization 
crisis. Though I would argue that 
polarization isn’t inherently bad, 
the real problem lies within our 
inability to understand opinions 
different from ours. 

Americans disagree strongly 

on 
many 
hot-button 
issues, 

and people on both sides are 
incredibly passionate about their 
beliefs. However, polarization 
stems beyond party lines. We are 
not only polarized on the issues 
themselves; we are polarized on 
how we prioritize these issues. 
Bernie 
Sanders 
stresses 
the 

importance of taking money out 
of politics. Meanwhile, Donald 
Trump’s biggest concern seems 
to be immigration. Not only do 
these candidates disagree on 
individual topics, but they also 
disagree on which issues are 
most important — and the same 
can be said about the American 
people.

A New Boston Post article 

has recently made the rounds 
on Facebook. The article seems 
to challenge modern American 
priorities. The author questions 
whether Americans are arguing 
over 
noteworthy 
topics. 
For 

example, 
is 
the 
transgender 

bathroom debate so significant 
that laws need to be passed to 
tell people which bathrooms 
they can or can’t use? Is it even 
possible to enforce those laws?

If we can afford to spend 

resources telling people which 

bathrooms they can’t use, we 
can certainly spend time and 
money trying to feed the 15.3 
million children living in food-
insecure households, right? Let’s 
not forget our homeless veterans; 
they deserve shelter and food 
as well, right? Or, perhaps, are 
these just issues that I have at 
the top of my priorities?

While 
questioning 
the 

relevance or significance of our 
priorities is important, the author 
of the article seems to imply 
that having different opinions 
is somehow unacceptable. The 
author seems concerned that 
polarization and division are 
going to ruin the country, which 
is an understandable concern.

Concerned 
that 
my 
liberal 

perspective 
on 
issues 
was 

contributing 
to 
polarization, 

I 
evaluated 
my 
priorities. 
I 

contemplated 
taking 
more 

moderate stances on issues that 
were most important to me, such 
as campaign finance reform, tax 
reform and education reform. 
However, 
after 
reflecting 
on 

my priorities, I came to the 
conclusion that polarization isn’t 
inherently bad. I believe that 
the major problem is a lack of 
understanding. The article led 
me to question whether my own 
convictions 
are 
problematic. 

Generally speaking, our opinions 
do not seem to be troublesome, 
but our inability to coexist with 
our differences of opinions is 
unsettling.

Most of us believe that our 

opinions and perspectives are 
correct, and we often find ourselves 
discussing our convictions with 
others who disagree. But I know 
my discussions tend to become 
arguments, 
and 
my 
passion 

sometimes becomes my weakness. 
Allowing my passion to control 
how I debate results in hostility 
and intolerance.

For example, when discussing 

welfare 
with 
a 
colleague, 
I 

expressed that I believe the U.S. 
government has an obligation 
to feed and shelter its most 
vulnerable citizens, regardless of 
whether the citizens are working 
or 
seeking 
employment. 
My 

colleague argued that anyone who 
wishes to collect welfare should, at 
the very least, be actively seeking 
employment or be employed. In 
hindsight, I probably should’ve 
recognized that as a reasonable 
perspective. However, my passion 
took over and I questioned why my 
colleague hated the poor. I know 
my colleague doesn’t hate the 
poor, but instead of arguing the 
reasoning behind my colleague’s 
opinion, I simply attacked his 
character. That’s a mistake that I 
currently try to avoid making, as 
it’s an unwarranted judgment of 
others.

For a while, especially after 

reading the article, I thought 
perhaps I’d be better off having 
no 
opinion 
on 
some 
topics. 

But perhaps the real issue was 
my 
inability 
to 
understand 

the perspectives of those who 
disagree with me. Rather than 
criticize opposing views, I began 
to try to understand them and 
in 
turn 
found 
myself 
much 

more comfortable with my own 
opinions. Rather than avoiding 
your 
own 
opinions, 
embrace 

them. At the same time, challenge 
yourself 
to 
understand 
the 

opinions of others. If individuals 
can work to understand others 
rather than reject them, I think 
we would find ourselves less 
concerned about polarization. I 
believe we are more than capable 
of coexisting with others who 
have opinions opposite of our 
own.

Edited and managed by students at 

the University of Michigan since 1890.

 Why you should do a Ph.D.
I

t’s that time of year when college 
students, 
especially 
rising 

seniors, are thinking about 

what to do after 
college. If you’re 
considering 
graduate school, 
I’d like to offer 
my two cents. Starting a Ph.D., just 
like beginning a professional doctoral 
program such as medicine, dentistry 
or law, is a serious undertaking that 
requires much consideration. There’s 
also a lot of public misconception 
about the worth of a Ph.D. compared 
to other professional degrees. So 
if you’re between graduate school 
and another option, consider the 
following:

1. A Ph.D. opens doors to 

a 
variety 
of 
career 
paths.

While 
medical 
students 
nearly 

always become doctors and law 
students typically become lawyers, 
Ph.D.s don’t just become researchers 
and academics upon graduating. 
Consulting 
firms, 
publications, 

intellectual property offices and 
venture capital groups all hire Ph.D.s. 
Holding a doctorate in a field makes 
you an expert, which makes you quite 
valuable to individuals needing a 
skilled worker on a specific task, and 
also gives you professional talents 
that can be applied in many different 
positions. Ph.D.s know how to 
analyze data, look for trends, problem 
solve and write. They’re utilitarian.

2. It teaches real-world skills.
The 
environment 
in 
which 

research is done, in many ways, 
mimics a job. You have colleagues 
with whom you develop professional 
relationships and learn to work 
constructively. You have an overseer 
to monitor your progress and provide 
direction. Working on a Ph.D. means 
more than spending time at a lab 
bench or sitting in an office. You 
have opportunities to present work 
to your colleagues at meetings and 
to give talks to larger audiences. 
You develop composure and learn to 
speak with fluidity. Conferences and 
symposia are perfect for learning 
how to meet strangers and have 
meaningful conversations, enabling 
new connections. If you finish a 
Ph.D. not having acquired most of 
these skills, you aren’t doing it right.

3. It’s often funded.
Starting graduate school doesn’t 

have to mean taking out loans or 
remaining financially dependent. 
Many doctoral programs, especially 
in science and engineering, provide 
their students with funds for tuition 
and living expenses. When they 
don’t, fellowships for just about 
every discipline are also available, 

or a Graduate Student Instructor 
(GSI) appointment can be used to 
defray the cost. With funding, you’re 
getting paid to earn an advanced 
degree, which itself increases your 
earning power. Very few degrees 
have that perk. You also learn 
important life skills along the 
way such as budgeting your own 
money, prioritizing your expenses 
and choosing an appropriate living 
arrangement. It’s a sensible first step 
upon leaving college.

4. It won’t take you eight years.
Maybe you’re willing to forgo 

starting a job immediately out of 
college to begin graduate school, but 
the thought of beginning a funded 
dual degree, such as an M.D./Ph.D., 
seems too excessive. I know and have 
loads of respect for the people who 
pursue such a track. But I wanted 
a program where I could complete 
in my 20s and immediately begin 
working, earning money that I could 
enjoy for a few years before thinking 
about settling down and starting a 
family. With a Ph.D., you’ll still feel 
young at the end, and you won’t ever 
be thinking to yourself, “I should 
have stayed in school longer.”

5. You’ll be making a completely 

new contribution to your field.

Because a Ph.D. is a research 

degree, it means you will learn what 
is known about your subject area and 
what is not. Then, you can choose a 
knowledge gap you are curious about 
and fill it. Your findings will interest 
others working in similar fields, and 
others after you will have your work 
to build from, incrementally growing 
the horizon. Research advances 
gradually, and even the biggest 
discoveries don’t happen without 
a firm foundation of prior work. 
When you tell others what you’re 
working on — whether it’s curing a 
disease, understanding something 
new about an ancient civilization or 
inventing a more energy-efficient 
means of transportation — they’ll be 
impressed.

It’s important to have a rewarding 

career, but if you’re spending several 
years preparing yourself for it, those 
years should be rewarding too. A 
Ph.D. is far more than completing 
coursework and passing classes. 
It means making a new discovery 
that enables research to progress, 
helping us to understand our world. 
Some day in the future, a physician 
or lawyer might apply something 
you discovered to help someone else. 
Research fuels all professions. Get 
involved.

I

t seems that society has 
a sort of rule of thumb in 
which artists are forgiven 

by history for 
their “strange 
behavior” 
because 
of 

their 
ability 

to 
create 
celebrated 
pieces, 

such as movies, books, etc. By 
“strange behavior,” I don’t mean 
the unusual oddities exhibited 
by geniuses, such as Nikola 
Tesla’s supposed habit of flexing 
his toes one hundred times a 
day. I’m talking about the more 
heinous crimes that were either 
not considered morally wrong 
during the artist’s lifetime or 
were simply ignored by those 
around them. Artists who are 
convicted or accused of rape 
or assault are, more often than 
not, forgiven, their actions are 
forgotten 
and 
they 
become 

idolized within their field by 
history. In contrast, the people 
who have accused these artists 
are 
oftentimes 
criticized 
by 

society — ostracized for daring 
to tarnish the reputation of such 
a respected person. Perhaps it is 
a desire to be able to enjoy the 
works of these artists without 
the distastefulness of knowing 
that this piece was created by 
a terrible human being that 
prompts the forgetfulness in 
regards to these crimes. 

The situation, in one case at 

least, appears to be changing. 
Recently, 
Bill 
Cosby 
has 

suffered a very public fall from 
grace, 
and 
though 
various 

celebrities still support the 
ex-comedian, it seems that his 
once-respectable 
name 
will 

forever 
be 
tarnished. 
Even 

if Cosby’s health were in a 
better state, I doubt that he 
would be able to find the same 
opportunities for work as he 
once had. Though I remain 
hopeful that Cosby’s downfall 
will eventually lead to the 
downfall of other celebrities 
who have been accused of 
sexual 
assault, 
I 
remain 

doubtful. 
Roman 
Polanski, 

who fled to France after being 
accused of sexually assaulting a 
13-year-old girl, is still making 
critically 
acclaimed 
movies. 

Woody Allen, whose film “Cafe 
Society” will be released this 
year, has garnered favorable 
reviews and featured an A-list 
cast, in spite of the fact that 
his adopted daughter, Dylan 
O’Sullivan Farrow, has accused 
him of sexually assaulting her 
(let’s also not forget the fact 
that Allen is married to a girl 
whom he met when she was 
not yet a teenager and was the 
adopted daughter of the woman 
Allen was then in a romantic 
relationship with). There’s a 
slew of other artists who have 
been convicted of predatory 
behavior, yet these actions are 
often forgotten by the media.

Since the mere fact that 

Bill Cosby has been indicted 
seems to be groundbreaking, 
it is interesting to consider 
what the future holds for other 
perpetrators who are now being 
punished. This is something I 
have thought of a lot recently, 
especially in regards to the 
publication of a piece by Dylan 
O’Sullivan Farrow’s brother, 
Ronan Farrow, “My Father, 
Woody Allen, and the Danger 
of Questions Unasked.” Though 
this piece appears to be a 
call to action to the media, it 
remains debatable what the 
role of critics, movie-goers 
and academics must play in 
response to respected men being 
recognized as perpetrators. I 
myself have decided to boycott 
any future film that Woody 
Allen decides to make. Though 
I enjoyed “Midnight in Paris” 
and 
“Annie 
Hall,” 
Woody 

Allen’s work is now effectively 
off-limits to me. I have never 
been a fan of Polanski’s work 
— 
I 
thought 
“Chinatown” 

perpetuated 
and 
minimized 

rape culture — so boycotting 
his work is obviously not going 
to be as hard as boycotting 

Allen. Though I enjoyed the 
“The Cosby Show” as a child, 
I have now decided to avoid it 
altogether in any way, shape or 
form.

I’m not asking for everyone 

to do what I am doing; I am 
instead hoping that the crimes 
of these men will not be swept 
under 
the 
rug 
by 
critics, 

academics or movie-goers. I 
hope that in the future, these 
artists are looked at holistically 
— that their actions outside of 
their creations be evaluated as 
well. Though I do believe that 
boycotting these artists’ newer 
works is the least we can do 
for the people whom they have 
allegedly assaulted, I wouldn’t 
expect others to subscribe to 
my actions outside of that, 
especially because it will be 
hard to try to ignore the huge 
effects that these men have 
had on their respective fields. 
Countless 
comedians 
cite 

Cosby as an influence, Allen’s 
work has been groundbreaking 
in the world of comedy and 
Polanski 
is 
highly-respected 

by many critics. It seems that 
it would be too much to ask for 
history to completely forget 
these men and their legacies. 
Whether we like it or not, the 
things that these men have 
done will be remembered for a 
period of time. The most we can 
hope for is that people will be 
aware that these masterpieces 
were created by bad people and 
stop trying to turn these artists 
into legends. Though these men 
may have been great at their 
craft, it should be remembered 
first that they abused other 
human beings, and, secondly, 
that 
they 
had 
many 
great 

accomplishments 
in 
their 

career. To do otherwise would 
be disrespectful to those they 
abused, as well as every other 
survivor who comes across the 
work of these artists.

M

ost of the time when I 
attend a University of 
Michigan-sponsored 

lecture 
from 

someone 
in 

the technology 
industry — be 
it a designer, 
researcher, teacher, engineer or 
investor — he or she focuses on 
choices they made to keep their 
business, 
product 
or 
process 

authentic and diverse. However, 
there often seems to be an 
elephant in the room, so to speak. 
Rarely do these speakers discuss 
their finances. It’s no secret 
that if a speaker is invited to a 
University event, they are a leader 
in their field, often with years of 
experience at various positions. 
It’s not a stretch to believe they are 
financially successful — especially 
if this speaker is from a Silicon 
Valley company or an up-and-
coming startup. It’s also not a 
stretch to believe that some of the 
students who attend these events 
are aiming for similar career 
trajectories. And money, whether 
you like it or not, is a massive factor 
in deciding upon a path for many 
people — particularly for students 
with years’ worth of loan debt.

I recently attended a talk given 

by Erin Teague, a University alum 
and Silicon Valley businesswoman 
and engineer. She spoke at the 
School of Information as part of the 
“Women in Information Careers” 
series. The expected questions 
about being a woman of color in 
the industry, job satisfaction and 
time management began to flow in. 
However, Teague largely steered 
the discussion toward her rise 
from UM undergraduate engineer 
to various jobs at Morgan Stanley, 
Harvard and in Silicon Valley, 
including her current management 
position at Yahoo. Not only did she 
focus on the specific choices she 
made to ascend these positions, but 
she also highlighted the financial 
impacts each choice had on her 
life.

I had never heard a speaker 

discuss their personal finances 

candidly, whether the speaker was 
male or female. Usually speakers 
focus so much on promoting the 
message of the company that they 
overlook the sea of debt-ridden 
internship seekers in front of them. 
Students are even more nervous as 
they see the career model of their 
parents’ generation — working 
for 30 years at the same company 
and retiring with a full pension — 
is neither viable nor particularly 
desirable for themselves. It was a 
breath of fresh air when Teague 
spoke frankly that professionals 
should see their time and skills as 
money-making assets and follow 
both their interests and their 
wallets to the best opportunities 
that arise, and not simply stay 
comfortable with their original 
negotiation. 
Teague 
advocated 

for professionals to weigh the 
benefits of salary, equity, options, 
etc. and confidently renegotiate 
when appropriate. She spoke of 
evaluating these assets at market 
value, negotiating confidently and 
effectively for raises and knowing 
what you are worth, monetarily 
speaking.

Equal pay for equal work is 

a concept that is rightfully and 
finally in the zeitgeist as feminism 
and social equity become common 
sense. But we need to get past 
simply discussing the problems 
of women being paid less and 
of 
recent 
graduates 
entering 

uncharted territory. We need to 
have upfront conversations with 
students 
about 
understanding 

how to value themselves and their 
abilities. We need more people 
— more women — like Teague 
speaking out honestly and without 
fear of seeming too materialistic, 
too ambitious or too masculine to 
educate college students on how to 
take advantage of their degrees. We 
need to not be afraid to broach the 
taboo of truly fair compensation 
in discussion — because money 
isn’t everything, but it certainly is 
important.

MUSIC REVIEW

‘Love’ is graceful

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

“Love and Friendship” is adapted 

from Jane Austen’s novella “Lady 
Susan.” Though not as well known 
or beloved as 
“Pride 
and 

Prejudice,” 
“Sense 
and 

Sensibility” 
or 

even 
“Emma,” 

this 
story 
is 

just as bright 
and funny, as it 
slyly pokes fun 
at several of its 
characters. It’s 
a marriage plot, but it’s less about 
grand gestures and declarations of 
love and more about a charismatic 
and charming woman’s ability 
to manipulate men — which is 
uncannily successful.

Directed 
by 
Whit 
Stillman, 

(“Damsels 
in 
Distress”) 
“Love 

and 
Friendship” 
follows 
Lady 

Susan Vernon (Kate Beckinsale, 
“Absolutely Anything”) and her 
daughter 
Frederica 
(Morfydd 

Clark, “The Falling”) as they visit 
and stay with relatives; they’re in a 
precarious position financially after 
the death of Lady Susan’s husband. 
Lady Susan wishes her daughter 
to marry Sir James Martin (Tom 
Bennett, “Shadow Dancer”), a well-
meaning but blithering idiot, for his 
wealth. Frederica is understandably 
reluctant 
and 
appeals 
to 
her 

mother’s sister-in-law Catherine 
(Emma Greenwell, “Dare to be 
Wild”), with whom they are staying, 
and Catherine’s brother Reginald 
(Xavier Samuel, “The Twilight 
Saga: Eclipse”). Lady Susan is 
disappointed in her daughter not 
only for disobeying her wishes 
but also for interrupting her own 
manipulations of Reginald, who is 
also wealthy and captivated by Lady 
Susan (to his family’s great distress).

Lady Susan often spends time 

with her American friend Alicia 
Johnson (Chloe Sevigny, “American 
Horror Story”), who helps her in her 
machinations. Their conversations 
feel as if one could overhear them 
today, full of wry humor and poking 
fun at oblivious men, but that in 
no way means they don’t require 
your full attention. At one point, 
put out that others aren’t adhering 
to the plans she had set for them 
and some of her more dishonest 
behavior had been found out, Lady 
Susan complains to Alicia, “Facts 
are horrid things.”

Though 
there 
are 
some 

exceptions, “Love and Friendship” 
isn’t exactly a star-studded cast. 
Perhaps that is what gives it quiet, 
unassuming authenticity. The film 
is 
simultaneously 
genuine 
and 

curiously self-aware, thanks to 
sharp, witty writing and a waltzing 
score that seems to laugh along 
with you at the establishing shots 
of real estate. The aesthetic delights 
of the film (costumes, hair, etc.) 
don’t pull focus from anything else 
but rather help the actors feel and 
look completely at home in this 
18th-century story.

The cast works effortlessly well 

together. Beckinsale and Bennett 
don’t have many scenes in which 
they interact alone, but they play 
each 
other 
up 
outstandingly, 

perspicacious genius and vacuous 
suitor both pursuing what they 
want.

By the end, four people have 

ended up coupled, but even the more 
virtuous pair can’t convince you 
that this story is romantic. While 
there are some shifty characters and 
a few bumbling husbands that make 
you laugh out loud — especially 
once you catch sight of their wives’ 
expression — Lady Susan is hero 
and villain and comic relief all at 
once. This story is hers. Stillman has 
crafted a tribute not only to Austen’s 
memory, but to some of her cleverest 
writing and funniest storytelling.

Flume’s latest blooms 
with a boom and a bang

Artist explores 

uncharted territory in 

new album.

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

If Electronic Dance Music 

(EDM) is disco, and hip hop 
is punk rock (an increasingly 
relevant 
historical 
parallel), 
it 

seems 
as 
if 

we’re 
just 

about 
to 

approach 
the 

end 
of 
the 

decade. As the 
1970s reached conclusion, both 
disco and punk began bloating 
to extremes, relying so heavily 
on over-the-top antics that they 
seemed to emulate the virtuosity 
that they ostensibly hated. At 
the end of the ’70s, punk rocker 
Wendy 
O. 
Williams 
of 
The 

Plasmatics cut her guitar in half 
with a chainsaw whilst donning a 
whipped cream bra on TV. In 2015, 
rapper Kanye West, accompanied 
by a swath of black-clothed men, 
tormented the 2015 BRIT Awards 
with a flamethrower. Near the 
end of the peak of disco, Studio 
54’s reputation as a hedonistic 
palace of debauchery reached its 
height, with stories of hundreds 
of pounds of glitter thrown 
onto dancers and outfits that 
were hardly a step away from 
the birthday suit. Today, EDM 
festivals 
like 
Electric 
Daisy 

Carnival cater to that kind of 
sweaty, sexy, drug-fueled fun on a 
much larger and commercialized 
scale, complete with enormous 
pyrotechnics and stage set-ups. 
The Las Vegas festival saw record 
attendance last year — 400,000 
people over three days.

In line with that swelling, 

bigger-is-better 
mantra, 
Skin, 

the 
sophomore 
album 
of 

Australian 
producer 
Flume, 

is much larger — it’s a grand-
staged vision of his self-titled 
debut, far more feature packed, 
louder and longer. Where his 
first venture aimed to move, this 
one aims to shake and entrance, 

which is certainly the goal in a 
genre that tries to compete for 
the most earth-shattering live 
performances. You’re not at an 
EDM performance to slowly sway 
and nod, that’s for sure.

Even as his culture inevitably 

pushes his musical tendencies 
towards pop hooks and rather 
homogenous 
female 
guest 

vocalists, Flume deserves credit 
for 
maintaining 
his 
voice, 

generally refraining from falling 
into usual EDM tropes. The most 
typical EDM features — an eight-
to-twelve 
bar 
crescendo-and-

beat-drop, an obligatory Justin 
Bieber feature, liberal use of the 
Pryda snare — are avoided. “Say 
It,” perhaps the most structurally 
traditional EDM track on the 
album and a clear attempt to meet 
the radio halfway, is still a few 
lanes left of the kind of formulaic 
work you’ll hear from headliners 
of the field, such as Steve Aoki, 
Tiesto and Zedd.

Flume is at his best when he 

builds a hit on his own territory. 
“Never Be Like You,” sung by Kai, 
a frequent EDM collaborator, 
exemplifies that. It’s an infectious 
blend of glitter, twirls and starts-
and-stops. If Skin is the grand 
version of debut-album Flume, 
“Never Be Like You” is the larger-
than-life rework of the producer’s 
popular single “Sleepless.” It’s 
not 
groundbreaking, 
but 
it’s 

enjoyable.

Still, on Skin, Flume makes 

notable strides in the experimental 
realm. “Wall Fuck” and “Pika” 
are two of the most free-form 
pieces Flume has ever created, 
lacking the tight, rhythmic song 
structure that Flume has polished 
throughout his career. They can 
feel unrealized at points, but 
this is forgivable for a first-time 
foray into generally unexplored 
territory for the producer.

Peddling back to the punk-

disco parallel, Skin also makes a 
clear attempt at creating bridges 
between the worlds of EDM and 
hip hop. Four rappers are featured 
on the album — Vic Mensa, Vince 
Staples, 
Allan 
Kingdom 
and 

Raekwon. “You Know,” featuring 
both 
Kingdom 
and 
former 

Wu-Tang 
member 
Raekwon, 

is one of the better Wu-Tang-
meets-electronic collaborations, 
recalling stylistically the James 
Blake track “Take a Fall For 
Me” featuring fellow Wu-Tang 
member RZA (though its more 
successful 
here). 
The 
Vince 

Staples 
feature, 
“Smoke 
& 

Retribution,” is a strong point, 
though Vince’s cadence can’t 
tackle the industrial, relentless 
beat as satisfyingly as, say, Danny 
Brown on “Handstand.”

If it seems like Skin is pulling 

from broad, and occasionally 
opposing, 
musical 
styles, 
it’s 

because it is. Just as Raekwon is 
featured, so is alternative singer-
songwriter Beck. At times the 
release can feel like it’s stretching 
beyond its “skin.” The growing 
pains put a spotlight on weakness 
once easier to ignore in Flume’s 
work. The sequencing — a small 
issue on his self-titled debut 
— can be almost jarring here, 
particularly during the first half 
of the album, where the juggling 
of influences can be too much 
to sustain. But it’s where Flume 
can whirl together all of these 
influences when Skin truly excels, 
and nowhere is this clearer than 
opener “Helix.” Flutes signal 
synths, fluttering wings give 
way to techno, techno introduces 
industrial and industrial opens 
up to a mind-bogglingly hypnotic 
conclusion that seems as at home 
at an enormous outdoor festival 
as it would a clandestine 1990s 
rave. Past meets present, and 
present meets past.

For its ambition, Skin loses 

some of the nuance afforded by 
Flume’s debut, but in its place 
is a shinier, expansive body of 
work that refuses to cede to 
redundancy. 
It 
signals 
both 

promising and welcoming new 
directions for the young producer, 
and, one might hope, a change in 
EDM’s old guard.

MUSIC FESTIVAL REVIEW

Eclectic group of 
artists make their 
way to New England

By KAREN HUA

Daily Arts Writer

BOSTON - Three days, 39 acts, 

smack in the middle of historic 
Beantown.

Revealed in a press release Friday, 

2016 is the final year that City Hall 
Plaza will host Boston Calling, as 
the music festival is slated to move 
to Harvard’s athletic campus in 
Allston, Mass. next May and expand 
to incorporate Natalie Portman’s 
(“Black Swan”) film festival. The 
traditionally biannual event will 
also discontinue its September 
edition.

Saturday reached a high of 99 

degrees 
while 
Sunday 
chilled 

the plaza with unusually cool 
temperatures. 
Likewise, 
here 

are the highs and lows of Boston 
Calling’s seventh festival.

Many of the 50,000 attendees this 

year didn’t know how to pronounce 
Sufjan (Soof-yan) Stevens, but they 
most likely witnessed the most 
alien concert of their lives. Kicking 
off the weekend, Stevens brought 
every flashy prop, costume and 
pyrotechnic imaginable to the stage: 
butterfly wings, pompoms, blow-
up figurines, eccentric wigs and 
goggles and hats, a full disco-ball 
suit and a whole balloon suit. Unlike 
music 
festivals 
like 
Bonnaroo, 

Boston 
Calling 
isn’t 
notorious 

for encouraging egregious drug 
experimentation, 
but 
Stevens 

and his neon-clad backup singers 
danced around like robotic versions 
of Richard Simmons, reminiscent 
of an acid trip. Every performer 
on his stage breathed his electric 
aesthetic, producing sounds that 
(albeit didn’t sound like English) 
glittered and sparkled. He ended 
his set on his more recognizable, 
“Chicago,” a semi-autobiographical 
song about youthful idealism. In a 
nutshell, it embodied Stevens’ show: 
a dreamlike fantasy manifested into 
reality. He cooed: “All things go / 
All things go,” as though to assuage 
the youth in the crowd. Needless to 
say, Stevens’ performance shattered 
the schema for a typical concert 
experience; he defined an out-of-
body sensation.

Sia 

Even though Sia closed only 

the first night, she takes home the 
prize for “Best of the Fest.” There 
was absolutely no performance 
that could compare to her drop-
dead stunning multimedia concert 
– an experience that intertwined 
live-action 
performance 
with 

audiovisual beauty. The Australian 
pop singer arrived in her iconic 
black-and-white wig that covered 
her eyes, and she commanded the 
back corner of the stage, where 
she didn’t budge for the entire set. 
Instead, she surprised an erupting 
audience with her music-video 
star, “Dance Moms” child prodigy 
Maddie Ziegler, whose live talents 
were unparalleled by any other. Sia 
arrived with her entourage of other 
eccentric dancers as well, ranging 
in gender and age, all donning 
nude-colored 
leotards 
and 
her 

signature wig. The two Jumbotrons 
that consistently broadcasted live 
onstage action actually displayed 
pre-recorded 
footage 
for 
Sia’s 

performance 
— 
tricking 
the 

audience into believing that what 
they saw on screen mirrored the 
real-life movements before them. 
So, the concert in a word: meta. 
Celebrities 
that 
danced 
across 

the screen such as Kristen Wiig 
(“SNL”) and Paul Dano (“Little Miss 
Sunshine”) weren’t actually present 
onstage — and who knows? Perhaps 
Sia wasn’t even there singing 
herself.

Børns
The highly-anticipated Børns, 

donned in hippie vibes and a 
tucked floral shirt, fell a little short 
of expectations. Garrett Borns, 
originally 
from 
Grand 
Haven, 

Mich., swayed in his stationary 
spot on stage, and though his music 
asks for a laxer rock atmosphere, 
even 
performances 
for 
upbeat 

tracks 
like 
“American 
Money” 

didn’t exude the soul the song begs 
for. With an unchanging backdrop 
and minimalistic lights, the singer 
could have put on a more riveting 
performance to compensate for his 
low-budget technical props – like 
many artists in the middle of the 
star-power scale did.

City and Colour
Amid the hazy New England heat, 

Saturday was mellow. The Vaccines 
were chill, Børns was soft, Canadian 
singer City and Colour was both of 
those things while oozing the soul 
the former two artists lacked. If 
sound could cry, if songs could be 
laced with tears, if music could 

hang longing in the air — that was 
exactly what City and Colour did. 
Starting with more popular tracks 
like “The Girl” and “Lover Come 
Back,” the set list cooled down in 
coordination with the setting sun. 
City and Colour elongated many of 
his songs, and his acoustic melodies 
and chilling falsettos carried the 
crowd into the night.

Courtney Barnett
Courtney 
Barnett 
is 
not 

everyone’s cup of tea, and in fact, 
she may purposely be tea that’s hard 
to swallow. The Australian singer-
songwriter’s music isn’t exactly 
mainstream, yet she received a 
Grammy nomination last year for 
Best New Artist; she’s surely a 
hardcore rocker, yet her stream-of-
consciousness lyrical style strays 
her into the indie category. Barnett’s 
concerts are always about the music 
— no shock elements, no extravagant 
wardrobe, no makeup— just her and 
her fiery, ferociously feminist hits. 
While she didn’t travel much during 
her set, her stationary position 
didn’t hold her hostage like it did for 
others. Barnett leapt up into the air; 
she slammed her body down on the 
stage, she rang out her guitar so hard 
that the strings seemed at peril to 
snap. She didn’t disappoint with the 
crowd favorite, “Pedestrian at Best,” 
in which, ironically, she screams: 
“Put me on a pedestal and I’ll only 
disappoint you.” Her passion was 
undeniable, but with downcast eyes 
and hair covering her countenance, 
her performance offered more of an 
aloof rather than direct chemistry 
for the audience. At least it’s safe to 
say Barnett had as much fun as her 
fans.

Miike Snow
As 
Boston 
Calling 
proved, 

stationary 
movement 
doesn’t 

always 
equate 
to 
a 
static 

performance. ODESZA, Disclosure, 
Courtney Barnett and others stand 
mostly in one spot on stage, yet the 
passion their facial expressions and 
vocal chops move audiences for 
them. While Andrew Wyatt, the 
lead singer of Miike Snow, used the 
stage to his advantage, his traveling 
didn’t make for as dynamic a 
performance because he seemed to 
approach his music more passively. 
Frequently returning to his cup of 
hot tea, Wyatt seemed to be more 
immersed in a rehearsal session 
than his screaming fans. This may 
be attributed to the fact that Wyatt 
and his band “don’t think (they’re) 
stars.” In an exclusive interview 

with The Michigan Daily, Wyatt 
said of iii, their third and most 
recent album, “This record is more 
like American to me … It feels like 
it’s drawing from Black American 
music traditions.” Wyatt explained 
he grew up highly influenced by 
Black icons like Stevie Wonder and 
Earth, Wind and Fire, and now, he 
defines: “extremely nerdy European 
and extreme disadvantaged African 
Americans: between those two 
crews, that’s where music moves 
forward, 
generally 
speaking.” 

Miike 
Snow 
surely 
has 
the 

European aspect, as Wyatt, the only 
American in a trio of Swedes, writes 
all the songs with his bandmates. 
Wyatt explained that most of their 
work is held together by hooks, so 
they understand how to produce a 
catchy song, but Miike Snow could 
have worked harder to build their 
own hype at their Boston Calling 
performance. Though they only 
recently 
started 
using 
laptops 

during their sets, they manipulate 
all their sounds live. The band is 
known for playing songs for as long 
(or as short) as they feel. “Animal” 
beat on for nearly eight minutes 
that night — but not quite at the 
rave vibe they were going for. Miike 
Snow’s three big closers, “Burial,” 
“Genghis Khan” and “Animal” felt 
a bit anticlimactic for a group like 
Miike Snow.

ODESZA
If the haze wore the crowd 

down, 
ODESZA 
reinvigorated 

heat-exhausted festival-goers to 
party on. ODESZA concerts always 
reverberate with such energy, it’s 
hard for them to get old, even after 
seeing them one, two, four or more 
times. Though the back of the crowd 
was slow to warm up, by the end of 
their set, their electronic-meets-
ethereal sound fired everyone up. 
ODESZA 
successfully 
launched 

Boston into the summer with tracks 
like (ironically) “Summer’s Gone” 
and “How Did I Get Here.” It’s 
an unfair comparison to smaller, 
lower-budget indie bands, but stage 
lights and production design really 
enhance the quality of a concert 
experience. As phenomenal as 
Robyn’s show was, the majority of 
the tired plaza filtered out following 
ODESZA. It looks like ODESZA was 
the real headliner Saturday night.

Robyn
Robyn was one big late-night 

dance party — pure thrill, pure 
fun. As one of the most dynamic 
performers 
the 
festival 
saw, 

Robyn’s merits were unfortunately 
overshadowed by the tepid turnout 
following ODESZA’S smashing set. 
Boston Calling was the first stop 
of her American festival tour, so 
she came fully equipped with her 
one-legged fringe pantsuit and 
her ponytail microphone stand. 
Interestingly, Robyn made the 
creative decision to remix some of 
her most popular songs by inviting 
some of her favorite artists onstage 
with her. Some highlights included 
The 
Black 
Madonna 
during 

“Indestructible,” and popular hits 
such as “Dancing On My Own” with 
French duo Cassius and “Stars 4 
Ever” with Zhala & Heal the World. 
Silhouetted by red and blue lights, 
Robyn showcased her impressive 
stamina by bouncing with nonstop 
energy. Her spirit almost sparkled 
on stage, as though her music sweat 
out through her pores instead of 
escaping from the microphone.

Unknown Mortal Orchestra
Frontman 
Ruban 
Nielson 

sauntered on stage — no need 
for an introduction — and just 
began playing. The band clearly 
felt comfortable on the stage, as 
if they were jamming among an 
audience of friends. Nielsen, a 
multi-instrumentalist, built up into 
a drumroll, introducing rougher 
rhythms that allowed him to shred 
his guitar and groove to undertones 
of synth. He immersed himself so 
deeply in the music that the lacking 
lights and backdrop seemed to fade 
away amid echoes from their Multi-
Love album.

Elle King
Who would’ve known this beauty 

was the spawn of crude comedian 
Rob 
Schneider? 
After 
hearing 

King’s set, though, it may make 
sense, as she unabashedly bellowed 
provocative lyrics about “being 
slutty” and openly admitted to 
having one too many drinks before 
her performance. Nevertheless, the 
crass and sass she brought to the 
stage was still outlined by a feminist 
fire that refused to apologize for 
being 
an 
independent 
“chain-

smoking, hard-drinking woman.” 
With a raspy voice and edgy 
country-meets-rocker 
aesthetic, 

the “hillbilly from Ohio” strummed 
her banjo named Claire and sang 
about her heartbreaking days. The 
crowd fell immediately in love with 
her candor and bowed down to 
their new Queen.

by a vast number of people.”

During his keynote address 

to the conference Wednesday 
evening, Detroit Mayor Mike 
Duggan also outlined profound 
problems 
in 
Detroit 
Public 

Schools and hailed the bill as 
being the best solution available 
to help the district. He also noted 
how the emergency managers 
of the district appointed by the 
state since 2009 have not been 
successful.

“The structure has no chance; 

it doesn’t matter who you bring 
in,” Duggan said. “(The state 
has) run the system for seven 
years because they said the 
school board couldn’t do it, and 
they’ve run a deficit every year.”

Duggan 
also 
hailed 

Washington D.C. as a model 
district in which a system similar 
to the D.E.C. has worked. He said 
Washington D.C. schools went 
from being the worst district 
in reading proficiency in 2007 
to among the highest reading 
proficiency of any urban school 
district in America, and he 
hopes the same transformation 
happens in Detroit.

“Anybody 
who 
can 
look 

and say we should defend the 
existing system, to me, there’s 
something they are not paying 
attention to,” Duggan said.

Quisenberry said the proposed 

bill falls short, however, as a 
means of recruiting new teaching 
talent and fixing the system 
already in place. He applauded 
school systems in Colorado and 
Massachusetts for having high 
standards for educators, and 

stressed that now is the time for 
educators in Michigan to strive 
to meet their models.

“It’s 
about 
increasing 

standards and expectations for 
all of our schools,” Quisenberry 
said. “I would love this crowd, 
this community, this chamber, 
the people in this organization 
standing up to Lansing and 
saying now is the time to have 
real standards and consistency.”

Though 
Rakolta 
and 

Quisenberry agreed that deficit 
spending in the district needs 
to be controlled, Rakolta stated 
that without the passing of the 
senate bill, there will be more 
losses incurred in the school 
system.

“We have had this humongous 

deficit spending, and I submit 
that it will continue into the 
future 
regardless 
of 
what 

happens in Lansing this week or 
next,” Rakolta said.

Tonya Allen, president and 

CEO of The Skillman Foundation 
— 
an 
organization 
helping 

students graduate from high 
school and prepare for college 
and careers — highlighted the 
importance of pushing beyond 
personal perspectives in order to 
fix the root of the problem.

“At some point or another, we 

have to make a decision to take 
away the things that don’t work 
and add things that do work,” 
Allen said. “The status quo is not 
going to improve the quality of 
schools for children.”

The panelists agreed that the 

most important factor moving 
forward is for the people of 
Detroit to be involved for any 
future system to work.

“What 
will 
happen 
after 

legislation will define who we 
are,” Quisenberry said.

MACKINAC
From Page 2

In an interview with the Daily, 

Kildee said he has started an 
online petition and is calling 
Michiganders who care about 
equality to speak out against this 
bill.

“It makes no sense ... it’s like 

they are searching for a way 
to pander to the far right by 
creating a problem that doesn’t 
exist,” Kildee said. “There is 
no rational law to discriminate 
against LGBT people. It’s an 
obvious political pander, and it’s 
destructive.”

State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–Ann 

Arbor) agreed that this is political 
pandering attempting to appeal 
to 
extreme 
and-or 
religious 

conservatives. However, he is 
confident that the bill will never 
be put to a vote.

“I don’t think it will come to 

a vote because the leadership 
understands that it’s bad for the 
state and for them politically,” 
Irwin said. “People realize that 
this whole idea that young men 
are going to try and switch 
their gender to try and invade a 
woman’s locker room is just not 
realistic. It’s a fine soundbite, 
but when you start to think 
about it, nobody is going to do 
that because of the severe social 
stigma that they would receive.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

building’s capacity has stayed the 
same. Gautz pointed to increased 
heroin use and a higher rate of 
women’s incarceration around 
the country for the rising number 
of Huron Valley inmates.

“Heroin usage has led to a lot 

of crimes women are committing 
to feed that drug habit, and all of 
our counties are sending more 
women to prison,” Gautz said.

However, Shecter, Steingold 

and a number of advocates 
underscored 
the 
vacuum 
of 

resources created by the influx 
of inmates as a greater issue 
than the sheer number of women 
housed in the facility.

“The state has abdicated its 

responsibility for these women,” 
Steingold said. “The fact they 
have to stand in long lines to 
get medications, some diabetic 
patients can’t access medications 
because of the long distances 
they have to walk … we’re talking 
about basic human needs.” 

Since 
2009, 
University 
of 

Michigan 
research 
assistant 

Lizzy Baskerville has facilitated a 
weekly acting program at Huron 
Valley 
with 
the 
University’s 

Prison Creative Arts Project 
(PCAP), which promotes artistic 
collaboration 
between 
the 

University community and the 
local incarcerated population. 
Baskerville noted the precarious 
state of female inmates’ mental 
health — roughly 20 percent of 
the entire U.S. inmate population 
is diagnosed with a mental 
illness — and argued poor living 
conditions exacerbate an already 
stressful climate.

“The 
suicide 
stuff 
is 
an 

epidemic,” 
Baskerville 
said. 

“Tensions are really high because 
they’re in such close proximity 
to other people. They mention 
often, ‘we’re all smiles in here,’ 
but outside, there’s tension.”

Furthermore, 
inmates 
face 

restricted 
access 
to 
medical 

treatment 
and 
educational 

services. 
For 
instance, 
454 

women 
are 
on 
the 
waiting 

list 
for 
GED 
classes, 
while 

1,151 women remain on the 
waiting 
list 
for 
vocational 

training — both numbers are 
the highest of any prison in 
the state. Ronald Simpson-Bey, 
a 
criminal 
justice 
advocate 

with 
JustLeadershipUSA 
— 

which is dedicated to reducing 
nationwide incarceration rates 
— and a former MDOC inmate, 
pushed 
back 
against 
state 

officials’ claims of a high parole 
rate at Huron Valley, saying the 
number of inmates that could be 
on parole is sizeable.

“There are maybe 400 or 500 

women that could be on parole 
but aren’t for having too much 
toilet paper — silly stuff like 
that,” he said. 

As the number of inmates 

steadily rises, the prison staff 
population is experiencing the 
opposite trend. More than a 
dozen Huron Valley employees 
have quit in the last six months, 
the Detroit Free Press reported 
earlier this month, and current 
staffers are consistently being 
forced 
to 
work 
mandatory 

overtime hours.

Gautz 
and 
other 
MDOC 

officials have confirmed the 
state is working on relieving a 
shortage of female correctional 
officers, but Steingold said the 

current state of the prison staff is 
unsustainable.

“There are guards there that 

don’t care, that hate what they 
do,” he said.

Bey-Simpson said there is a 

positive 
correlation 
between 

extreme stress on staff members 
and tension between inmates and 
officers.

“(Huron Valley) has been sued 

so many times they know how 
to not willfully neglect people,” 
he said. “These are frustrated 
people doing a stressful job.” 

Shecter’s lawsuit, then, is 

not the first legal complaint 
against Huron Valley — nor 
are allegations of overworked 
staff unique to this year. Many 
advocates view the facility’s 
current situation as a tipping 
point in a vicious cycle of prison 
overcrowding 
throughout 

Michigan. 
Despite 
the 
fact 

that 
the 
state’s 
corrections 

expenditures have risen only 
moderately in the last five years, 
MDOC’s funding has jumped 
from 3 percent of the state budget 
in 1980 to 20 percent in 2014.

Rosemary 
Sarri, 
professor 

emerita at the University’s Social 
of Social Work, conducted one of 
the first studies on Huron Valley 
after its opening in 1977. Sarri 
highlighted a tenuous history 
of 
women’s 
imprisonment, 

especially 
following 
the 

consolidation of four previous 
women’s facilities into Huron 
Valley in 2009.

“There’s a complete lack of 

funding,” Sarri said. “One in 10 
of children in Michigan have a 
parent in prison … incarceration 
in this state is futile.”

Sarri 
and 
other 
advocacy 

groups like the American Friends 

Service Committee are at the 
forefront of lobbying for reforms 
to the state prison system, but 
they 
complain 
of 
resistance 

from State Attorney General 
Bill 
Schuette, 
state 
officials 

and legislators. Schuette has 
publicly criticized bills revising 
parole procedures and minimum 
sentences and has linked the 
attempted 
changes 
to 
anti-

cop and anti-law enforcement 
sentiments. 

Bey-Simpson also alluded to 

long-standing internal inaction 
within MDOC.

“It’s 
a 
department-wide 

problem,” he said. “There’s this 
idea of ‘we’ll pay the fine,’ but 
this is still the way we’ll do it.” 

Gautz 
said, 
though 
the 

department has made an effort 
to implement measures such as 
drug courts — specialized courts 
dedicated to helping nonviolent 
drug offenders reach recovery 
and reintegation services — and 
boot camps, which are short 
residential 
programs 
similar 

to military basic training, state 
officials’ divergent perspectives 
are one of many obstacles in 
bringing 
prison 
populations 

down.

“We 
can 
have 
all 
these 

programs and find ways to 
divert people who have been 
put through the criminal justice 
system, but you have to have 
county judges that will send the 
women to those places,” Gautz 
said. “It will take a lot of work on 
our end to educate judges about 
this so that they feel it’s going to 
be a good fit for that individual.”

The need for more public 

education 
on 
the 
state 
of 

Michigan’s prisons is not limited 
to lawmakers. Though Huron 

Valley — the subject of so many 
debates over incarceration and 
inmate treatment in the Michigan 
— sits roughly 15 minutes away 
from the University’s central 
campus, Baskerville and other 
students 
involved 
in 
PCAP 

argued that incidents of suicide, 
disappointing prison conditions 
and 
mass 
incarceration 
in 

general are non-issues to the 
student body at large. 

Baskerville 
traced 
the 

University community’s lack of 
knowledge of the prison crisis at 
hand to issues of gender, race and 
socioeconomic status. 

“The fact that they’re women 

and the fact that they’re poor — 
it’s as much poverty as it is race — 
but we don’t care about women of 
color or poor women,” she said. 

LSA senior Elaine Chen, a 

PCAP facilitator with experience 
at 
Huron 
Valley, 
agreed 

students’ 
perceptions 
of 
the 

incarcerated population need to 
be shifted. When PCAP created 
a photography display of artwork 
produced by inmate participants 
last semester on the Diag, Chen 
said pictures were vandalized 
with cigarette burns, and some 
where even stolen straight from 
their frames. 

“This is the mentality we need 

to deal with,” she said. “There 
are students on this campus 
doing things that could get them 
behind those bars — mainly drugs 
— but we don’t see somebody as 
the worst thing they’ve done.”

Chen brightened, however, at 

the prospect of student action 
surrounding prison reform.

“Student activism absolutely 

has a place in criminal justice 
reform,” she said. “Connecting 
one-on-one is where it starts.” 

responsive to an essay prompt 
and how to write a coherent 
essay helps you anywhere.”

Brad Carney, a U.S. Army 

Ranger who served for six years, 
said the program helped him 
expand his educational potential. 
Carney will be enrolling at 
Dartmouth College this fall, 
hoping to study politics and 
governance.

“I didn’t think that I was 

competitive 
in 
terms 
of 

education; I didn’t think that 
I had the skills to go to a good 
school,” Carney said. “I got with 
a couple of organizations like the 

Warrior-Scholar program … and 
eventually I got admission into 
Dartmouth. I really discovered 
that I have what it takes because 
of programs like this.”

Dane 
Harvey 
has 
served 

in the military for 22 years 
and is leaving the service this 
December. His original plan was 
to enter the military contracting 
industry but has since decided to 
pursue higher education instead. 
He intends to study education.

“This is a good opportunity 

for me to brush up on skills,” 
Harvey said. “These programs 
have broadened my horizons 
and made me aware that I may 
be able to get into better schools 
than I was expecting to be able to 
before. It has been eye-opening.”

Women’s College World Series Preview

By AVI SHOLKOFF and 
BETELHEM ASHAME

Daily Sports Writers

After 
early-season 
contests, 

conference games and tournaments, 
Regionals and Super Regionals, just 
eight teams remain to compete in 
the Women’s College World Series in 
Oklahoma City.

Notably absent is No. 1 Florida, 

which was upset by No. 16 Georgia in 
the Super Regionals, thwarting the 
Gators’ attempt to become just the 
second team to win three straight 
championships in the WCWS.

The Michigan softball team arrives 

in Oklahoma City well-rested after a 
come-from-behind Super Regionals 
victory in which the second-ranked 
Wolverines scored four runs in the 
top of the seventh inning to vanquish 
No. 17 Missouri, 5-4. 

“Team 39 has fought really hard 

… they’ve had high expectations all 
year, and they’ve had to work through 
the burden of it,” said Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins. “I’m looking 
forward to getting to Oklahoma City 
so we can just enjoy playing.”

The Daily previews every WCWS 

team, listed in order of the team’s 
ranking.

No. 2 Michigan (21-2 Big Ten, 

51-5 overall)

With nearly every starter in the 

lineup returning from last season’s 
runner-up squad, the Wolverines 
have 
the 
experience 
and 
the 

personnel to make a deep run in the 
WCWS.

In the circle, junior right-hander 

Megan Betsa has pitched all but 0.2 
innings of Michigan’s postseason 
thus far, allowing just eight runs. 
Through two playoff rounds, Betsa 
ranks second nationally in strikeouts 
per seven innings with 10.7.

Offensively, the Wolverines rank 

eighth in postseason batting average 
with a .315 clip and have scored 30 
runs in their past five games. From 
senior centerfielder Sierra Lawrence 
in the lead-off spot to junior 
shortstop Abby Ramirez in the No. 
9 hole, Michigan’s lineup is stacked. 
Nearly every player hits at least .300, 
with the majority over .320. In the 
Super Regional, junior third baseman 
Lindsay Montemarano hit two home 
runs and finished with four RBI.

Before 
competing 
against 

relatively 
weak 
conference 

opponents, Michigan traveled to the 
West Coast and Southeast to face off 
against top teams like Florida, No. 8 
Florida State and No. 12 UCLA — the 
latter two of which the Wolverines 

defeated, and both teams are now in 
the WCWS.

This is the third and final WCWS 

for second basemen Sierra Romero, 
Lawrence, 
rightfielder 
Kelsey 

Susalla, right-hander Sara Driesenga 
and the Wolverines’ three other 
seniors. They will look to avenge a 
gut-wrenching loss in last season’s 
championship. With Florida not in 
the tournament, the Wolverines 
are the favorite to bring home their 
second title.

No. 3 Oklahoma (17-1 Big 12, 52-7 

overall)

Left-hander Paige Parker leads 

the Sooners in the circle. Parker 
garnered Big 12 Pitcher of the Year 
for the second straight season. The 
sophomore won 28 games, sported a 
1.45 earned-run average and pitched 
12 shutouts, the second best in the 
nation. In Oklahoma’s victory last 
weekend over No. 14 Louisiana 
Lafayette, 
Parker 
pitched 
two 

complete games.

That offense leads all postseason 

teams with a .362 batting average. 
Oklahoma’s freshmen anchor the 
offense with first baseman Shay 
Knighten leading the team in home 
runs with 11, second baseman 
Caleigh Clifton ranks first in on-base-
percentage with .558 and third 
baseman Sydney Romero — the sister 
of Michigan’s Sierra — leads the team 
in triples and has struck out just four 
times in 193 at-bats.

The Sooners return to the WCWS 

for the first time since 2014 and 
currently hold a 27-game winning 
streak, cementing their place as the 
team with the most momentum in 
the tournament.

No. 4 Auburn (16-7 SEC, 54-10 

overall)

Spending much of the year as 

a top-five team in the nation, the 
Tigers have risen to prominence 
thanks in large part to a 17-game win 
streak in the middle of their season, 
including 13 straight victories over 
Southeastern Conference foes.

With a dynamic offense led by 

third basemen Kasey Cooper — 
one of three finalists for 2016 USA 
Softball Player of the Year — Auburn 
is making just its second appearance 
in the WCWS. The Tigers breezed 
through 
their 
NCAA 
Regional, 

outscoring their opponents 22-4 en 
route to three wins. After a 5-3 loss 
to Arizona in the first game of their 
Super Regional, Auburn rallied with 
4-1 and 6-1 victories to earn a spot in 
Oklahoma City.

The Tigers also claimed the SEC 

Tournament crown — defeating 

Alabama, Florida and LSU in the 
process — an impressive feat given 
that the conference boasts four of the 
eight teams in the WCWS.

No. 6 Alabama (16-8 SEC, 51-12 

overall)

In 36 innings this postseason, the 

Crimson Tide have allowed just four 
runs and three earned. Right-hander 
Alexis Osorio leads Alabama from 
the circle, pitching 29.1 postseason 
innings en route to four wins and 
no runs allowed. Osorio dealt with 
injuries throughout the season, but 
now appears to be fully healthy.

At the plate, lead-off hitter 

Haylie McCleney ranks first on the 
Crimson Tide in batting average, 
stolen bases, doubles and on-base 
and 
slugging 
percentage. 
She 

earned All-SEC first team for the 
third time in her career.

Alabama finished fifth in the SEC, 

which remains one of softball’s most 
difficult conference. The Crimson 
Tide also swept No. 11 Washington 
in their Super Regional and defeated 
Florida twice in the regular season.

Thursday, Alabama will face 

Oklahoma 
in 
its 
first 
game, 

attempting to end the Sooners’ 
27-game winning streak. 

No. 8 Florida State (21-2 ACC, 

53-8 overall)

The Seminoles are making their 

ninth appearance in the WCWS. 
Florida State dropped just two 
conference games all year and 
won its third consecutive ACC 
Championship — 13th overall in 
the conference’s 25-year history in 
softball.

The Seminoles roll into the WCWS 

riding a 10-game winning streak. 
Florida State defeated Florida A&M, 
1-0, and South Carolina, 4-0 and 2-1, 
in their Regional, while sweeping 
Utah in the Super Regional. Backed 
by a commanding pitching staff, 
Jessica Burroughs and Meghan Kind 
— both with ERAs hovering around 
2.00 — will pose a great challenge.

Florida State took on Michigan 

twice in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge 
back in February, but couldn’t keep up 
with the Wolverines’ overpowering 
offense, 
falling 
6-2 
and 
10-3. 

However, in the midst of a surge of 
momentum, the Seminoles look likely 
to keep rolling in the WCWS. But 
their first opponent, Georgia, may be 
riding even more momentum having 
just knocked off two-time defending 
national champion Florida.

No. 10 LSU (13-11 SEC, 50-16 

overall)

The Tigers upset No. 7 James 

Madison in their Super Regional last 

weekend to return to the WCWS for 
the second straight year. Pitching 
is the key to LSU’s success, with its 
three starters posting ERAs below 
2.30. Right-hander Carley Hoover 
anchors the rotation, striking out 214 
batters in 177.2 innings. At the plate, 
infielder Bianca Bell earned first-
team All-SEC honors after hitting 
.386 with 12 home runs.

LSU was swept by both Florida 

and then- No. 16 Kentucky, but the 
Tigers did beat No. 6 Alabama twice 
at home and reached the final of the 
SEC tournament before losing to No. 
4 Auburn.

Though the team is young — it 

started three freshmen in the final 
Super Regional game — but has 
proved it can compete with the top 
teams this season.

The Tigers take on Michigan, the 

highest ranked team in the WCWS, 
in their first game Thursday.

No. 12 UCLA (16-5-1 Pac-12, 

40-14-1 overall)

A 
national 
powerhouse 
with 

11 WCWS titles, most recently in 
2010, the Bruins battled their way to 
Oklahoma City with a major upset 
of No. 5-seed Oregon. After taking 
an 8-1 loss to the Ducks to open its 
Super Regional, UCLA looked likely 
to be sent packing, but the Bruins 
roared back on the second day of 
competition with back-to-back 2-1 
victories.

UCLA boasts a dominant offense 

spearheaded by second team All-
Americans Mysha Sataraka and 
Delaney Spaulding. Sataraka leads the 
team with a .763 slugging percentage 
and a .561 on-base percentage, while 

Spaulding leads the team with 17 
home runs and 61 RBI.

The Bruins also played Michigan 

in February during the Mary Nutter 
Collegiate Classic and fell just short 
against the Wolverines, 8-6, off a late 
three-run homer. However, with a 
major boost from a Super Regional 
win, Auburn will hacve its hands full 
with UCLA.

No. 16 Georgia (12-12 SEC, 45-18 

overall)

The 
Bulldogs 
are 
the 
most 

surprising inclusion in the WCWS. 
They are the lowest seed of the eight 
teams, and they needed to defeat top-
ranked Florida twice in Gainesville, 
Fla. Led by right-hander Chelsea 
Wilkinson, who sports a 1.84 ERA 
alongside 27 wins, Georgia swept the 
Gators en route to the WCWS.

First baseman Tina Iosefa leads 

the nation in home runs and RBI with 
23 and 86, respectively, and outfielder 
Cortni Emanuel adds speed at the 
top of lineup, stealing 32 bases in 32 
attempts, third best in the SEC.

Earlier in the season, the Bulldogs 

lost to UCLA via the run-rule, 14-6. 
In conference play, they faced off 
against Auburn, LSU and Alabama, 
but failed to win more than one game 
in any of those series. The Bulldogs 
could not advance past the first round 
in the SEC tournament, losing to Ole 
Miss, 4-2.

Georgia is led by its powerful 

offense that run-ruled its first 10 
opponents including seven shutouts. 
The Bulldogs’ offense will need to get 
going against a pitching rotation as 
powerful as Florida State’s in its first 
matchup.

Five Wolverines qualify at 
NCAA Outdoor East Prelim

They will head to 
Eugene, Ore., for 
the NCAA Outdoor 

Championships

By MATTHEW KENNEDY

Daily Sports Writer

Competing for the first time 

since 
winning 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Outdoor 
Championship, 
the 

Michigan women’s track and 
field team had a simple goal in 
mind: get as many athletes to the 
NCAA Outdoor Championships 
as possible.

So 
when 
the 
Wolverines 

opened competition at the NCAA 
Outdoor East Preliminary in 
Jacksonville, Fla., on Friday, they 
did just that with five athletes 
qualifying for the NCAA Outdoor 
Championships in Eugene, Ore., 
on June 9.

In 
the 
10,000-meter 
run, 

redshirt sophomore Gina Sereno 
— who won the Big Ten Outdoor 
Championship in the event two 
weeks ago — put up a fourth-
place 
finish 
overall, 
despite 

being the No. 22 seed, with a 
time of 34:24.10 to qualify for the 
NCAA Outdoor Championships 
next weekend. The qualifying 
process for the 10,000-meter run 
consisted of only one run with 
the top 12 runners advancing, 

thus not allowing much room for 
error.

The meet was different than 

most in that only a few athletes 
took part in it. Just 13 Michigan 
athletes traveled to and competed 
in the meet, which is just one-
fifth the size of when the entire 
team travels.

“It’s a lot different,” said 

Michigan coach James Henry. 
“It’s not a lot of athletes, so you 
don’t feel that team camaraderie, 
and our team and athletes are not 
in every single event. It’s more of 
an individual thing, but we had 
a large enough group of ladies 
there to feel as much a team as 
possible.”

The Wolverines had a quiet 

Friday 
with 
most 
Michigan 

runners taking part in heats. 
The busiest event on the day was 
the 3,000-meter steeplechase, 
in which the top 12 times 
advanced to Eugene. Sophomore 
Claire 
Borchers 
very 
nearly 

qualified for the NCAA Outdoor 
Championships, but finished in 
13th with a time of 10:08.47 — 
0.6 seconds out of advancing. 
Redshirt 
Sophomore 
Sarah 

Zieve 
and 
fifth-year 
Senior 

Anna Pasternak also took part 
in the event, with Zieve setting a 
personal best time.

The next day was completely 

different, 
though, 
with 
four 

Wolverines advancing to the 
Eugene.

In 
the 
100-meter 
hurdle, 

senior Cindy Ofili — who holds 
the eighth-fastest time in the 
world in that event — won her 
heat with a time of 12.86 seconds 
to automatically qualify for the 
NCAA Outdoor Championships.

Arguably the best event of the 

weekend for Michigan came in 
the 1,500-meter run with three 
athletes competing, including 
redshirt senior Shannon Osika, 
a Big Ten Outdoor champion. 
Competing alongside her in the 
same heat was fifth-year senior 
Devon Hoppe, and in a different 
heat junior Jaimie Phelan. All 
three runners finished in the 
top five of their respective heats, 
which gave them all automatic 
bids to Eugene.

“I was fortunate enough to 

have Jaimie and Shannon to be 
able to do everything with – to 
warm up with, cool down with, 
do all of our runs with,” Hoppe 
said. “Even though it’s very 
individually focused, we have 
to do what we can to make sure 
that we all feel supportive as 
well.”

The 
five 
Wolverines 

qualifying for the championship 
meet is the most since 2009, 
and with Michigan’s goal of 
getting as many athletes to the 
championship as possible now 
over, the runners can set a new 
goal to focus on: outrun their 
competitors.

Redshirt senior Shannon Osika received an automatic bid to NCAAs for her performance in the 1,500-meter run.

Six clinch spots for 

NCAA Championships

By MIKE PERSAK

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s track and 

field team has steadily improved 
under the tenure of coach Jerry 
Clayton. This weekend at the 
NCAA Preliminary Rounds was 
no different, as the Wolverines 
had six athletes qualify for the 
NCAA Outdoor Championships 
— the most since Clayton has 
taken over.

Redshirt freshman thrower 

Joe Ellis was the first person 
to secure his spot for Michigan 
on Thursday, which he did on 
his final attempt in the hammer 
throw. Ellis unleashed a throw 
of 68.25 meters, which not only 
gave him a fourth-place finish 
in the meet, 
but also set 
a new school 
record 
for 
the 

Wolverines.

Ellis 

wasn’t 
the 
only 

freshman to 
move on for 
Michigan. Freshman sprinter 
Taylor McLaughlin clinched his 
own spot at the NCAA Outdoor 
Championships on Thursday in 
the 400-meter hurdles, making 
him the first true freshman 
Wolverine to do so in the last 11 
years. McLaughlin finished with 
a time of 49.84 seconds, good 
enough for a fifth-place finish 
overall.

Though Ellis and McLaughlin 

weren’t the only ones to have 
success this weekend, their 
contributions as freshmen give 
Michigan bright hope for its 
future, and Clayton and his staff 
hope to use their experiences as 
references for future freshmen. 

“Hopefully, in the future, 

we’ll be able to bring in this 
level of freshmen and they’ll be 
able to make that transition,” 
Clayton said. “Or we’ll bring 
some people in and redshirt 
them the first year (like Ellis) to 
help them grow in that respect 
as well.”

Redshirt 
sophomore 
Ben 

Flanagan 
qualified 
for 
the 

NCAA Outdoor Championships 
as well in the 10,000-meter 
event. Flanagan finished in 

sixth-place at the meet with 
a time of 30:04.60 in an event 
that was extremely competitive 
throughout. 
Though 
most 

10,000-meter 
runs 
tend 
to 

finish with a large amount 
of separation in between the 
runners, this particular race 
finished with just 2.84 seconds 
separating the winner from the 
12th-placed finisher.

The Wolverines’ other three 

qualifiers for the national meet 
are redshirt junior decathlete 
Steven Bastien in the decathlon, 
fifth-year 
senior 
distance 

runner Mason Ferlic in the 
3,000-meter steeplechase and 
redshirt junior distance runner 
Tony Smoragiewicz.

All six athletes representing 

Michigan in the 
NCAA Outdoor 
Championships 
will now turn 
to preparation 
for the next two 
weeks. But for 
the Wolverines, 
that 
doesn’t 

necessarily 
mean 
that 

anything will change.

“At this point in the season, 

I think consistency is most 
important, 
because 
you’re 

going in to new experiences,” 
Flanagan said. “For example, 
we have a lot of guys going to 
nationals for the first time. 
It can be challenging (not) to 
attempt try to try different 
things and feel like you have to 
put maximum energy into this 
week. But it’s really important to 
stay grounded and realize that 
everything we’ve done up to this 
point is the reason we’ve been so 
successful this season, and you 
really want to stick to that type 
of routine.”

The 
NCAA 
Outdoor 

Championships will not only 
serve as the ultimate measuring 
stick for Michigan’s qualifiers, 
but it will also serve as a building 
block for the future.

“If you can get an athlete 

to the national level in their 
freshman or sophomore year, 
it’s a tremendous advantage for 
them, especially going into their 
later years,” Clayton said. “Of 
course, that’s what we want to 
do, is build the program.”

“At this point, 
consistency is 

most important.”

Selection Committee passes on 

Wolverines, ends season abruptly

By COLE ZINGAS

Daily Sports Writer

After a rocky finish to end its 

season, the Michigan baseball 
team was on the bubble entering 
Monday’s NCAA Tournament 
selection show. 

Baseball 
America 
listed 

Michigan as one of the “First 
Four Out” of the 64-team field 
before the selection show, leaving 
the Wolverines hoping that they 
could sneak into the field. Last 
year, Michigan did not have to 
sweat out the selection process, 
as a Big Ten Tournament Title 
gave it an automatic bid into the 
tourney.

But this year, the selection 

committee 
passed 
on 
the 

Wolverines, ending their season 
prematurely. From the Big Ten, 
Nebraska and Minnesota earned 
the at-large bids. No. 23 Ohio 
State earned their way into the 
field after winning the Big Ten 
Tournament.

Michigan entered the season 

ranked No. 15 in the country, and 

for a long while, they lived up 
to the high expectations. They 
blistered their way to a historic 
start to the year, holding a 34-12 
overall record through May 8. 

But the Wolverines hit a rough 

patch, and stumbled to the finish. 
Their final two weeks of the 
season featured losses against 
Central 
Michigan and 
Oakland, and 
they 
ended 

the 
regular 

season losing 
seven of eight 
heading 
into 

the Big Ten 
Tournament.

The 

Wolverines, 
however, still 
had fight left in them. After 
an opening round loss to Ohio 
State, they beat the No. 1 seed 
Minnesota, 3-2, to earn a rematch 
against the Buckeyes. However, 
Michigan was again unable to 
power past Ohio State, and fell, 
11-4. Though the Wolverines 
were unable to repeat as Big Ten 

Tournament Champions, a win 
against 
Minnesota 
certainly 

provided a boost to their NCAA 
résumé.

They held a No. 37 ranking in 

the ratings percentage index, the 
highest of any Big Ten school, 
but the Wolverines were hurt 
by their lack of marquee wins. 

They went 4-7 
against the Top 
50. Also, the 
only 
opponent 

on 
Michigan’s 

schedule 
that 

currently 
sits 

in the Baseball 
America 
Top 

25 
was 
the 

Buckeyes. The 
Wolverines 
did 

not win a game 

against Ohio State in five games 
played.

Still, dominant sweeps against 

Big Ten foes like Rutgers and 
Nebraska, 
along 
with 
out-

of-conference 
wins 
against 

Oklahoma State and California, 
set the stage for a possible 
selection into the postseason.

The Wolverines 

were hurt by 
their lack of 

marquee wins.

‘M’ Baseball: A 
season in review

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

At the start of the 2016 season, 

the Michigan baseball team was 
ranked in multiple polls, including 
No. 
15 
by 
Baseball 
America. 

Coming off a Big Ten Tournament 
championship and a close NCAA 
Regional loss to Louisville last 
season, the Wolverines looked 
poised for another big year with 
several key contributors returning 
from the 2015 squad.

For 
most 
of 
this 
season, 

Michigan lived up to the hype. By 
May 10, the Wolverines were off 
to their best start since 1987 with 
a 34-12 record. Michigan (13-10 
Big Ten, 36-21 overall) was within 
striking distance of its first Big Ten 
regular-season title since 2008 
and looked to be a shoo-in for the 
NCAA Tournament. There was 
even talk of the Wolverines hosting 
a regional. All of these seemed well 
within reach, so what could’ve 
gone wrong? 

As 
it 
turned 
out, 
almost 

everything.

The 
Wolverines’ 
troubles 

began with a tough loss at Central 
Michigan on May 11, in which 
they trailed 8-0 and rallied in the 
late innings to make it 8-7, but 
fell just short of the comeback 
victory. While road losses are not 
uncommon even for the best teams 
in college baseball, the Chippewas 
finished the year just 24-37, making 
it especially painful for Michigan.

But the real catastrophe for 

the Wolverines was a three-game 
sweep by Ohio State on May 13-15. 
Michigan came up just short in the 
first contest, a 3-2 loss, before the 
Buckeyes topped the Wolverines 
7-3 and 8-2 in the following two 
contests.

To add insult to injury, the 

Wolverines lost senior left fielder 
Matt Ramsay and junior first 
baseman, outfielder and pitcher 
Carmen 
Benedetti 
to 
injuries 

during the Ohio State series. 
While Michigan still retained 
key contributors such as senior 
center fielder Cody Bruder and 
sophomore third baseman Jake 
Bivens, Ramsay’s and Benedetti’s 
absences proved to be severe blows.

After a nail-biting 6-5 home 

defeat at the hands of Oakland, 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich and 

the Wolverines appeared to regain 
momentum with a 1-0 road win 
at Illinois thanks to a masterful 
pitching 
performance 
from 

junior left-hander Brett Adcock. 
Michigan then found itself with a 
7-2 advantage in game two against 
the Illini.

Any traction the Wolverines 

gained was quickly lost, though, as 
Illinois stormed back to win game 
two, 11-8, before taking game three, 
6-1.

The Big Ten Tournament didn’t 

start any better for Michigan 
when Ohio State downed the 
Wolverines, 8-3. It looked like 
Michigan was going to exit the Big 
Ten Tournament with a whimper 
when it was down 2-1 against 
Minnesota in the eighth inning, but 
an RBI single by Bivens and several 
miscues by the Golden Gophers 
propelled the Wolverines to a 3-2 
victory, which gave them hope for 
another tournament run.

The Buckeyes — the eventual 

Big Ten Tournament champions 
— ended those dreams quickly, 
though, when they eliminated the 
Wolverines with an overwhelming 
11-4 victory.

In spite of the way the season 

ended, there were several moments 
from 2016 that the Wolverines will 
look back on fondly, including a 5-0 
win at then-No. 10 California on 
Feb. 29 and a three-game sweep of 
eventual NCAA-Tournament team 
Nebraska on April 17.

But the most exciting moment 

for Michigan may have been 
an 11-inning, 4-3 win against 
Michigan State at Ray Fisher 
Stadium on April 29. Freshman 
second baseman Ako Thomas 
secured the victory with a two-out, 
walk-off single.

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, that win was their only 
one against the Spartans in 2016. 
Michigan squandered a 5-0 edge 
April 30 in East Lansing en route 
to a 7-6 defeat, and fell 7-4 in Ann 
Arbor on May 1. In light of the way 
the season ended, those shortfalls 
against the Spartans sting the 
Wolverines even more now with 
their season at an end.

Michigan will lose some key 

contributors to graduation this 
year, including Ramsay, Bruder, 
designated hitter Dominic Jamett 
and left-hander Evan Hill.
