"UMHS acquires health system

University to absorb
Allegiance Health in
unprecedented deal
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
The University of Michi-
gan Health System formally
announced Tuesday a partner-
ship agreement with Allegiance
Health, a health system based
in Jackson, Mich. The agree-
ment will eventually grow
UMHS' patient capacity by 50

percent - adding Allegiance's
490 beds to its system.
Per the agreement, signed
Monday, the two organizations
would continue treating their
own patients but would share
resources and capital as needed
while the University takes on
the role of "parent company" to
Allegiance. Ultimately, UMHS
will absorb Allegiance.
Though the regulatory fil-
ings and due process necessary
to formalize the agreement
will likely progress through
mid-summer, UMHS CEO Ora
Pescovitz expressed enthu-

siasm for the project, repeat-
edly saying in a conference
call Tuesday that the purchase
will benefit both partners' pro-
grams.
"We're very excited about
the proposed affiliation, which
will enable us to serve the com-
munity better, make a big dif-
ference in improving health
and creating a better communi-
ty during health care reform,"
Pescovitz said. "Webelieve that
we're a state resource and want
to improve the quality of care
within Michigan. It's also criti-
cal to provide the right care, at

the right place, at the right time
and to keep local care local."
Patients requiring complex
care would be treated in Ann
Arbor, not unlike the referral
base the hospitals have built in
the past.
The University plans to
invest $25 million in Alle-
giance initially, which will
fund routine maintenance and
equipment. Over the next five
to seven years, there will be a
total of $100 million invested
in the partnership, though it's
expected that Allegiance will

By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
The Central Student Government
Assembly voted Tuesday to begin
funding the late-night off-campus
Universitybus route, after the initia-
tive was announced by CSG officials
in October.
CSG and the Interfraternity
Council are working with Park-
ing and Transportation Services to
assign some of the University's Blue
Buses to a route that transports stu-
dents to off-campus areas between
the hours of 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. The
service will begin in January, as pre-
viously reported.
The route is expected to begin at
the corner of Oxford Road and Hill
Street, and will make stops on Hill
Street, South University Avenue,
Packard Street, Thompson Street
and North University Avenue, end-
ing at the C.C. Little bus stop. Most

U of Maryland Senate to examine marijuana policy

A subcommittee of the Univer-
sity of Maryland Student Senate
will examine the policy of medi-
cal marijuana on campus, The
Diamondback reported Tuesday.
The use of marijuana for
medicinalor recreational purpos-
es is banned on campus. Mikayla
Hellwich, a senior horticulture
and crop production major, pro-
posed new legislation to the sen-
ate that would allow the use of
the drug on campus for medicinal
purposes only.
"I think that it's necessary to
be compassionate for people who
are sick. I know that this is con-
sidered a taboo issue, but really
it shouldn't be," Hellwich said.
"It should be common sense that

people who are sick should have
access to the medicinetheyneed."
Senate Chairman Vincent
Novara noted that the examina-
tion would go no further than
using marijuana as a medicine.
He said the senate has no inter-
est in entertaining the idea of the
drug for recreational purposes.
University of Arkansas
receives $3-million gift for
Dept. of Chemical Engineering
The Department of Chemical
Engineering at the University of
Arkansas received a $3 million
donation from alum Kevin Brown
and his wife, Marie, The Arkan-
sas Traveler reported Tuesday.

The gift will be used to create
an endowed department head
chair within the College of Engi-
neering. The donation allows the
university to hire other profes-
sors out of the budget, since the
endowment head is not being
paid from that source. This will
result in a lower student-to-fac-
ulty ratio.
"This is a critical need, since
endowed positions help us
remain competitive with our
peers," Chancellor G. David Gear-
hart said in a press conference.
"Kevin and Marie's giftwill make
a tremendous impact within the
College of Engineering."

Union official: New York train
engineer 'nodded' at controls

Updated healthcare.gov gets
mixed reviews in first week

Questions about
employee mount after
speed determined
factor in crash
YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) - An
engineer whose speeding com-
muter train ran off the rails along
a curve, killing four people, nod-
ded at the controls just before the
wreck, and by the time he caught
himself it was too late, a union
official said Tuesday.
William Rockefeller "basically
nodded," said Anthony Bottali-
co, leader of the rail employees
union, relating what he said the
engineer told him.
"He had the equivalent of what
we all have when we drive a car,"
Bottalico said. "That is, you some-
times have a momentary nod or
whatever that might be. How long
that lasts, I can't answer that."
Rockefeller's lawyer did not

return calls. During a late-after-
noon news conference, federal
investigators said they were still
talking to Rockefeller, and they
wouldn't comment on his level
of alertness around the time of
the Sunday morning wreck in the
Bronx.
Separately, however, two law
enforcement officials said the
engineer told police at the scene
that his mind was wandering
before he realized the train was
in trouble and by then it was too
late to do anything about it. One
of the officials said Rockefeller
described himself as being "in a
daze" before the wreck.
The officials, who were briefed
on the engineer's comments,
weren't authorized to discuss the
investigation publicly and spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
Questions about Rockefeller's
role mounted rapidly after inves-
tigators disclosed on Monday that
the Metro-North Railroad train
jumped the tracks after going into

-H-, 0

a curve at 82 mph, or nearly three
times the 30 mph speed limit.
Dozens of people were hurt.
"He caught himself, but he
caught himself too late. ... He
powered down, he put the train
in emergency, but that was six
seconds prior to derailment," Bot-
talico said.
Rockefeller, who was operating
the train from the front car, was
treated at a hospital for minor
injuries and was released.
National Transportation Safe-
ty Board member Earl Weener
repeated that it was too soon to
say whether the accident was
caused by human error. But he
said investigators have found no
problems with the brakes or sig-
nals.
Alcohol tests on the train's
crew members were negative, and
investigators were awaiting the
results of drug tests, the NTSB
official said.
On the day of the crash, Rock-
efeller was on the second day of a
five-day work week, reporting at
5:04 a.m. after atypical nine-hour
shift the day before, Weener said.
"There's every indication that
he would have had time to get
full restorative sleep," Weener
said.
Weener didn't address spe-
cifically what the engineer was
doing in the hours before his shift
started but said part of the inves-
tigation will be creating a 72-hour
timeline of his activities.
Bottalico said Rockefeller
"never said anything about not
getting enough sleep." But he said
the engineer had switched just
weeks earlier from the night shift
to the day shift, "so he did have a
change in his hours and his cir-
cadian rhythms with regard to
sleep."
The New York Police Depart-
ment is conducting its own
investigation, with help from the
Bronx district attorney's office, in
the event the derailment becomes
a criminal case.
Rockefeller, meanwhile, stayed
out of sight. But his union and for-
mer co-workers spoke up in his
defense.

BANKRUPTCY
From Page 1A
The plan will determine the
terms for the partial repayment
of the city's $18 billion debt. The
city will negotiate an agreement
with its creditors - including
unions and retirement associa-
tions whose members hold city
pensions - to decide how much
of the debt needs to be repaid.
The remaining debt will be can-
celed after creditors and the
judge approve the final plan.
Pottow said bankruptcy is gen-
erally a positive development for
cities and their residents, except
for the creditors who may lose
out on the full repayment of the
city's debts, including pensions
for city workers.
He added that the city's bank-
ruptcy would have effects on the
metro Detroit region, including
Ann Arbor.
"There's spillover effect," Pot-
tow said. "If you have a blighted
city, it's not like that blight stops
at the municipal border. It's like
if the house down the street is in
foreclosure, my property value
goes down, too."

taurants.
Over the past several decades,
businesses such as Good Time
Charley's bar and restaurant,
the Middle Earth gift shop, and
Pinball Pete's arcade - all estab-
lished in the late '70s to early
'80s - have seen plenty of estab-
lishments come and go, while
changing themselves to meet the
demands of each generation.
Charley's is one of the places
that has changed the most over
its tenure on South University. A
gas station occupied the location
until 1979, and at certain points
of the building's history it was a
pizza parlor, a bar and an arcade.
"During the '80s it was one of
the most popular places on cam-
pus, and so they expanded in
the '90s next door where Under-
ground Printing is right now, so
that was also Good Time Char-
ley's," Adam Lowenstein, the
current owner of Charley's, said.
The pizza parlor later elimi-
nated, the kitchen was moved
back and the arcade was removed,
with the original owners choos-
ing to concentrate on the bar and
restaurant aspects of the opera-
tion.
Lowenstein and his business
partner Justin Herrick, who
acquired Charley's in April 2007,
have expanded on that focus.
He said their goal for Charley's
is to maintain food sales while
expanding bar revenue.
"Having a bar/restaurant here
we always felt was a prime loca-
tion, especially on the corner of
South University Avenue and
Church Street." Lowenstein said.
"It's really where we feel the
heart of student life is."
Middle Earth owner Cynthia
Shevel said she hasn't seen her
business model change much
during her time on South Uni-
versity Avenue, but has observed
a lot of change on the street since

her store moved in there during
the mid-1970s.
"There was a far more diverse
retail environment at that point
- there was a very high-end
houseware store called the Arti-
san Shop, there were several
women's clothing stores, there
were at least two or three shoe
stores, not so many restaurants,
there was a movie theater

Pottow also noted that metro
Detroit residents could lose out
if an institution like the Detroit
Institute of Arts were to close
to assist in the repayment of the
city's debts.
In a statement delivered after
the ruling, Detroit Mayor Dave
Bing said there would be a host
of difficult negotiations to follow
the decision.
"We are now starting from
square one," Bing said. "There's
going to be pain for a lot of differ-
ent people, but in the long run I
think the future of the city will be
bright."
The city's biggest creditors,
such as unions and retiree asso-
ciations, argued against a Detroit
municipal bankruptcy, fearful
pensions and other debts owed to
their members by the city will not
be honored.
"I do think it's a tough day for
all of us here in Detroit," Bing
said. "I believe since I came to
office the crisis that we had -
this was inevitable. I don't think
anyone necessarily wanted to go
in this direction, but now that
we're here, it's more important
that we work together as opposed
to continuing to fight each other."
across the street," Shevel said.
"And by the late '80s, almost all of
that was gone. "
Shevel added that, for Middle
Earth, which early on moved
between several different areas
of downtown, South University
Avenue has worked out well.
"We cater largely to students
and University people; we get a
lot of foot traffic," she said. "It
depends on what you sell, but for
what we sell, it is agood location."
For Pinball Pete's, founded in
1983, the story is a little different.
It started off with three different
locations around Ann Arbor, but
by 1996 was consolidated under
one roof on South University
Avenue.
The property - originally an
old Victorian house - had to be
almost entirely remodeled.
"One of the obstacles I remem-
ber is that it had five chimneys
in it that we had to remove," said
Ted Arnold, one of two co-own-
ers. "So that was quite a process."
A decade later, in 2006, Pinball
Pete's moved across the street to
its current location.
"We'd never done anything
quite like this," said co-owner
Mike Reynolds. "We'd done a
basement before, but this was
pretty big. It was a lot for two
guys to try to take on. And obvi-
ously the rest is kind of history.
We're still here."
Arnold added that for Pinball
Pete's, the area has been benefi-
cial mostly because of the large
amount of foot traffic.
"We've kind of got to be right
in the heart of it, because we're
not something that people search
out anymore." Arnold said. "We
like to consider ourselves one of
the landmarks on the street - us,
the Brown Jug. We've seen a lot
of things come and go."
As the executive director of
the South University Area Asso-
ciation and a former business
owner, Maggie Ladd has spent
more than20 years on South Uni-
versity Avenue.

For her, the years have been
marked by a decline in retail,
an increase in an ever-shifting
gamut of restaurants - the street
once held a McDonald's, a Burger
King and a Taco Bell, but is now
trending more toward Asian res-
taurants - and reforms in the
zoning code.
South U goes vertical
A 2006 change to the city code

Emergency Manager Kevyn
Orr applauded Rhodes' decision
and said his team looks forward
to working with creditors on an
agreeable restructuring plan.
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder
- who appointed Detroit's con-
troversial emergency manager -
said authorizing the decision for
the city to seek bankruptcy was a
difficult decision, but was the last
viable option to restore the ser-
vices Detroiters need.
"Today, the federal court
allowed Detroit to stay on the
path toward a brighter future,"
Snyder wrote. "A future where
streetlights work and ambu-
lances respond quickly. A future
where crime and blight shrink,
and where jobs and investments
surge."
Gubernatorial candidate Mark
Schauer, the apparent Democrat-
ic nominee, has frequently voiced
his opposition to the appoint-
ment of an unelected emergency
manager. In a statement, Schauer
encouraged Snyder to allow May-
or-elect Mike Duggan to lead the
city's restructuring efforts.
"It's time to rebuild the great
city of Detroit," Schauer said.
"How we got here isn't as impor-
aligned South University's zoning
regulations more with the rest of
downtown, allowing buildingsup
to 150 feet tall in a bid to increase
high-density commercial and
residential building development.
"Nobody wanted to develop in
the area because the zoning was
so restrictive," Ladd said. "As
soon as that changed, we imme-
diately saw that people were
interested."
Within months of the zoning
change, the Zaragon Place apart-
ment complex, which opened in
2009, was approved by the city.
It was followed by the Land-
mark apartment complex, which
opened in 2012.
"We're kind of on the cusp of a
change in the area, because of the
new buildings that have gone up,
the Zaragon building and Land-
mark," Ladd said. "It's always
difficult to say which comes first,
the chicken or the egg, but I think
we're on the cusp of change."
And that's not the end: there
are plans to open an additional
high-rise above Pizza House on
Church Street.
Thus far, both restaurants and
retail industries alike have seen
new businesses join the street.
Merritt, a self-described "cause-
based fashion brand" opened up
on South University Avenue in
November.
"This is the heart of campus,"
founder Dave Merritt said. "It's
a great street for building aware-
ness as a new storefront. When
you're talking about starting
from scratch, not a lot of people
knowing you, it's really impor-
tant to be in front of people."
Mike Gradillas, general man-
ager of The Blue Leprechaun,
echoed the sentiment. The bar
was formerly Touchdown Cafe,
and reopened in 2008 under the
new name.
"South University is a great
place to run a business," he said.
"I mean, you have an endless sup-
ply of kids, a pool of people."
Gradillas, who has been work-

ing on the street on and off since
1999, added that among all the
changes, there are still constants.
"A lot of things have changed,
a lot of businesses have come
and gone, but the general feel
has been the same - the sense
of community, the sense of coop-
eration between the people that
work in the businesses, that's
stayed."

contribute to this sum through
increased efficiency and strategic
capital moves.
The acquisition of Allegiance
will add 430 physicians to
UMHS' current 2700. Addition-
ally, average annual outpatient
visits will increase by 48,000,
on top of UMHS' current annual
average of 1.94 million visits.
The partnership also doubles the
number of hospital care facilities.
Georgia Fojtasek, president
and CEO of Allegiance Health,
said during the conference call
that Allegiance has had a steady
relationship with the Univer-
sity leading up to the decision,
including collaboration between
the oncology and cardiovascular
departments.
"We have a long history with
the University of Michigan that

the community may not be aware
of due to its geographical prox-
imity and clinical resources,"
Foitasek said. "This will give
us the foundation to leverage
in the new era of health care
because we both have formida-
ble resources."
Fojtaskek clarified that there
are no plans to alter Allegiance's
leadership or staff at this time,
saying there's been a "commit-
ment to stay" during this time
of transition. She added that the
feedback from her staff has been
largely positive.
"People have a respect for the
University of Michigan and the
high-quality work that they do
with sophisticated and high lev-
els of care," she said. "This will be
a good thing for the community
as a whole."
Fojtaskek said financial dis-
tress "was not a guiding prin-
ciple" in the decision.
Though this is the first

time UMHS will absorb another
health system, the University has
partnered with other hospitals in
the past, includingtheTrinityand
MidMichigan Health systems.
In regards to training future
physicians, both CEOs expressed
confidence in the validity of Alle-
giance's intern program and want
to work to continue to grow its
graduate medical and residency
programs as well.
Though UMHS and Allegiance
will eventually comprise one for-
mal health system, there is no
decision yet as to what it will be
called.
"We've embarked on numerous
partnerships in the past, though
this is the first of this nature,"
Pescovitz said. "Since it's fully
integrated, it was not taken light-
ly. But we felt most aligned with
the values that Allegiance has, as
well as their mission vision and
our relationship and strong refer-
ral base."

students were around."
To improve the success for
the second campaign, Longmi-
er, along with James Cutler, his
partner on the project, enlisted
the help of Simon Halpern, a
second year MBA student in
the Ross School of Business, to
"help make it a little more pub-
licly digestible," he said.
Halpern said he is really
excited to be working on the
project and thinks the key to
the campaign's success has
been reaching out to people
who wouldn't traditionally be
interested in space travel.
"There's still a small crowd of
aerospace people who love this
stuff and the rest of the world is
like 'whatever,' " Halpern said.
"But when you start to see what

the possibilities of a successful
project could be, like, you know,
better weather prediction, or
lower cost of access to space,
that's huge."
Halpern's responsibilities
have included developing the
group's marketing plan, an out-
reach plan and managing the
social media for the project,
which is titled GoBluePlasma.
He has also reached out to
important alumni such as Uni-
versity alum Dhani Jones, a
former NFL star, to help raise
awareness for the project.
Jones expressed his interest in
space travel and his excitement at
helping to work on the design and
marketing strategy used for Kick-
starter. He said this is his first
time being involved in a space-
related project and doesn't think
it will be his last.
"If you think about the verge
of the next level of explora-

tion, I think space travel is
going to be important and that
this is part of that understand-
ing of what's in the distant and
beyond," Jones said.
This isn't Jones' first invest-
ment in a campus startup. In
September, it was announced
that he would fund the estab-
lishment of a co-op community
geared towards entrepreneur-
ship-minded students.
Halpern said he is thrilled
and can't believe how quickly
CAT reached its goal. He hopes
to continue with the momen-
tum the fundraising has been
gaining thus far.
"We would be besides our-
selves if we could get to some of
our stretch goals to enable us to
continue some more advanced
scientific research and contin-
ue developing the CAT engine
at a faster pace with some more
exciting options," Halpern said.

is going to act as a deterrent for
some of the crime that you see."
If Parking and Transporta
tion Services is not able to hire
additional drivers in time, CSG
will contract a third-party com-
pany, Trinity Bus Services, to
run the route. With the addi-
tional bus company and its
drivers, the cost would rise to
$49,932.
If Trinity is used, $40,000 of
the program will be funded by
the Interfraternity Council and
the CSG Executive Branch. The
additional $9,932 will be paid
from the legislative branch's
discretionary account.
"I think the bus route is a
great idea. I am in full support
of it," LSA senior Pratik Gosh,
an LSA assembly representa-
tive and the chair of finance
committee, said. "I have been

asking people for the last five
weeks if they had any problems,
but nobody really had any prob-
lems."
Proppe said the only obstacle
that could stand in the way of
the late-night bus route would
be if somebody from the CSG
executive branch, the Interfra-
ternity Council or the assembly
did not wish to use a third-par-
ty service for the route. If Blue
Buses are not available, CSG
may consider delaying the route
one more semester - which
would mean the pilot route
would commence next fall.
"We haven't had that conver-
sation yet. We are going to cross
that bridge when we come to
it," Proppe said. "I am holding
out hope we are going to be able
to use the Michigan buses next
semester."

Higher wages, better living
Raising the minimum wage can revitalize Michigan's economy
Calls to increase the minimum wage in Michigan have gained
momentum over the last year. In April, Democratic lawmakers
in the state's legislature introduced a bill that would raise the
minimum wage to $10 over a three-year period. A month later, fast-food
workers across the state participated in a nationwide protest, demanding
a wage increase to $15 an hour. And during his visit to Detroit on Mon-
day, the presumed Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer
addressed these concerns, announcing his plan to increase the state's
minimum wage to $9.25 over three years. Regardless of who wins the
gubernatorial race in November 2014, raising the minimum wage should
be a priority for Michigan as the state attempts economic revitalization.

aybe you saw this inter-
view circling around
the social-media strato-
sphere a few
weeks ago. In
the clip, BBC's
Jeremy Pax-
man interviews
actor/comedian
Russell Brand,
who spends 10
minutes advo-
cating for a JFFE
revolutionary OFFENRARTZ
overthrow of the
current political
system. The shaggy former-drug-
addict-turned-celebrity is verbose
but sharp, eloquently espousing
a vision of egalitarianism - first
laid out in his lengthy New States-
men feature - in which the masses
cooperate to remedy global wealth
disparities, remove the influence
of big business from politics and
end the devastation of planetary
resources. when Paxman press-
es for details about just how this
would be achieved, Brand responds,
"Jeremy, darling, don't ask me to sit
here in a bloody hotel room and
devise a global utopian system."
I suspect thatthis response ticked
a lot of people off. In a scathing cri-
tique, Conservative commentator
Lord (ha) Norman Tebbit notes that,
"what was totally missing ... was
any vision of how Mr. Brand would
like to see our social, economic and
political system in his post-revo-
lutionary era," before concluding
that Brand is, "no more than a self-
important self publicist."
For those of us who generally
favor the three main components
of Brand's proposition - redress
growing income inequality, get cor-
porate interests out of politics, quit
fucking up the environment - Teb-
bit's critique of Brand's motive and
lack of strategy poses two impor-
tant questions. First, in challenging
the dominant ideology of globalist
capitalism, is it required to have
a preconceived alternative with
methods of creation and implemen-
tation already laid out? And second,
what right does someone with no
background in economic or politi-
cal theory have to call for reform -
or even revolution - of our current
political and economic system?
Enter Pope Francis. In only
eight months, the sovereign of
Vatican City has achieved a viral

popularity with his call for a more
relaxed stance on birth control, his
admonishment of lavish spending
by bishops and his suggestion that
persecuting homosexuals is maybe
not the most Christian thing to do.
"Nice work, new Pope," applauded
the reasonable humans of the 21st
century. "Keep it up."
But then last Tuesday, in his first
papal pronouncement, the pontiff
took a direct shot at supply-side
economics that left many wonder-
lng if the leader had overstepped
his role as non-partisan theolo-
gian. Lashing out at "trickle-down
theories" and "the absolute auton-
omy of markets," Francis spoke of
the proverbial little guy, rendered
"defenseless before the interests of
a deified market."
In a column for Yahoo's finance
section, Rick Newman dismisses the
remarks as liberal idealism, before
observing that, "the pope doesn't
have much to say about what would
be better." He goes on to add, "What
has been a lot
more effective at
raisingthe living Russell
standards of bil-
lions, however, is and Pop
cold, hard-edged
capitalism." have suc
Though the
religious leader presen
and the come- alternativ
dian could not be
more different,
there are telling
similarities - both obvious and less
so - between Pope Francis's call for
reform and Russell Brand's call for
revolution. On the surface, both are
criticisms of laissez-faire econom-
ics, concerned that our obsession
with growth has created a power
elite with an ability - and tendency
- to exploitthe underclass. Both flirt
with socialist-based solutions, while
never actually addressing the ideol-
ogy's essential tenet - that is, public
ownership of the means of produc-
tion. And both statements have been
ridiculed for the fact that neither
figure appears capable of devising an
economic system more favorable -
oratleastmore profitable - thanfree
enterprise without restrictions.
What may be less obvious in this
tedious comparison of the two fig-
ures is the fact thatboththe Pope and
Brand are rallying as much against
capitalismastheyareapathy,employ-
ing their high profile platforms to

e
Ic

offer an emotional appeal directed
squarely at a younger generation.
Consider Brand's recommendation
that, "the solutionhas to be primarily
spiritual and secondarily political,"
and his qualification of spiritual as,
"the acknowledgement that our con-
nection to one another and the planet
must be prioritized." Similarly, con-
sider Pope Francis, speaking in an
interview about the growing culture
of exclusion: "What I would tell the
youth is to worry about looking after
one another and to be conscious of
this and to not allow themselves tobe
thrown away."
There's an important parallel in
the Pope's carefully worded criticism
of "deified markets" and Brand's dis-
course on "spiritual revolution." In
the two decades since the fall of glob-
al communism as a serious threat,
the increasing reliance on free-mar-
ket solutions has been married to
the prevailing notion that we're each
entitled to our individual excess, and
that cutting social programs in the
name of auster-
ity will permit
Brand the market to
eliminate this
Francis abstract concept
of human suffer-
'essfully ing. In attempt-
ing to terminate
ted an the creeping
iAWolCoI plague of apathy,
' '* I'd argue that it's
-- first necessary to
present an alter-
native mindset to a system that has
left so many disillusioned and even
more impoverished.
Pope Francis calls this the "dic-
tatorship of an impersonal economy
lacking a truly human purpose."
Brand calls it "a system predicated
on aspects of ... greed, selfishness
and fear." The respected econom-
ic minds of our time - the Paul
Krugmans and Paul Ryans of the
world - would have a more tech-
nical assessment of this system;
perhaps an analysis based more in
policy than emotion. Still, Brand
and Pope Francis have successfully
presented an alternative ideology
- one focused on eliminating the
exclusionary, individualistic ideals
that precipitate widespread apathy
- and for that alone their remarks
should be taken seriously.

Since the last wage hike in 2007, Congress
has allowed the national minimum wage to
stagnate at an amount incapable of sufficiently
supporting an individual - let alone entire
families. At the current rate of $7.40 per hour,
a minimum-wage worker in Michigan will
earn roughly $15,000 annually - less than the
$18,163 MIT estimates a single adult needs to
live in Michigan. Schauer claims his initiative
will aid in solving the financial struggles of the
electorate. At the press conference on Monday
he stated: "This is about people. It's a measure
that will help stimulate economic growth." As
low wages struggle to meet the demands of
inflation, Schauer's concern for the people and
their economic welfare is refreshing for a state
plagued by financial hardships.
Schauer's initiative is not an entirely new
one. Four states - California, NewYork, Con-
necticut and Rhode Island - have already
initiated policies to increase their minimum
wage this year. California, in particular, has
set the standard by planning on increasing
pay to $10 per hour by 2016. While the wage
hikes have been contested by Republicans,

both large and small businesses support the
initiative. A recent study found 70 percent of
small-business owners agree with the idea of
raisingthe minimum wage within their states
- arguing an increase in wages would ampli-
fy the workers' spending ability and, in turn,
boost the economy.
Critics of raising the minimum wage argue
that an increase in pay will lead to an overall
decline in employment. However, as Schau-
er suggested, the economic boost the state
will receive simply from increased spending
on basic necessities will add $1 million over
three years to Michigan's economy. In those
three years, Michigan will experience a net
increase in jobs available - even when an
increased minimum wage is factored in.
In order to remain competitive within the
national economy, Michigan's legislature
needs to follow the examples of California
and other states and to recognize the needs of
the people. With Detroit still in a precarious
state and a substantial number of residents
struggling to bypass the poverty line, raising
the minimum wage is a viable solution.

VICTORIA NOBLE I
Pope's views warrant attention

POLINA FRADKIN I
Diary of a dumb bitch'

Pope Francis assumed the papacy amidst
a serious culture problem for the Catholic
Church. Viewed as corrupt, antiquated and
unable to control its own priests, the Church's
message was received with more than a grain
of salt by many. However, the "apostolic exhor-
tation," released by Francis Nov. 26, deserves
universal recognition for its promotion of basic
human equality and economic support.
In his 224-page document, Francis con-
demns the consumer culture that creates
unfair disparities by which individuals are
systematically dehumanized and deprived of
basic goods and services and condemns that
these things are accepted as a valid trade-off.
He asks questions like, "How can it be that it
is not a news item when an elderly homeless
person dies of exposure, but it is news when
the stock market loses two points?" These
questions deserve consideration from us all.
The document connects the need to change
this world system with biblical values and
Catholic social teaching, but Francis's message
isn't exclusively religious. Calling .for better
care and compassion for the homeless, unem-
ployed, underemployed, elderly and other dis-
advantaged groups is a message that students
- regardless of faith - should consider.
As university students, we fall within a
small minority of educated young people.
Regardless of socioeconomic background,
being students - and probably future grad-
uates - of the University places us in an
advantaged position compared with much of
the world. According to the Huffington Post,
in 2010, only 6.7 percent of the world had a
college degree. We're among that fortunate
small percentage and therefore have an obli-
gation to use some of what we learn here to
help others. We're part of - and near the top
- of a complex, global economic system that
disadvantages many. Our education gives us
the privilege to change it. It's important that
we take that opportunity.
Francis's document brings much needed
attention to a problem that's often overlooked

by world leaders. Endemic poverty often
receives very little attention compared to
other economic issues, and the global reach of
the papacy has already forced the issue back
into the international spotlight. After the
release of the document, the Pope met with
Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss
the welfare of Russian citizens.
The Pope also called for more politicians
that are "genuinely disturbed by the state of
society, the people and the lives of the poor."
And while he didn't list specific parties or
countries that need to make these political
changes first, I'd be willing to bet that the
United States is on the shortlist.
The document is clearly a step in the right
direction for the Catholic Church. The push
for greater economic equality is a good move
for an institution that spent several centuries
as a key player in the detrimental economic
system that this document deplores.
But there's more work to be done. As a Cath-
olic, I'm deeply disturbed by the state of the
Church - even now. A deep-seated intolerance
for LGBTQ lifestyles is problematic for a new
papacy that wants to promote equality, a value
that's not solely economic in nature. In the doc-
ument, Francis wrote that he isn't interested in
changing the Church's stance on gay marriage.
True equality has cultural, political and social
implications, and they all need to be addressed
if the Church wants to successfully emerge
from the shadows of past scandals.
The document also lacks a specific, cred-
ible plan of action that will really shake up
a world of economic, political and social
unfairness, a culture of massive spending
and a lack of appreciation for the lives of the
disadvantaged. But that's our job. Catholic or
not, the problem highlighted by the Pope is
real and affects us all. Hopefully our Univer-
sity educations will enable us to craft creative
solutions to some of the world's most difficult
problems of inequality.

If I had to guess what single fac-
tor will bring about the demise of
this great nation, it'd be the sexy
baby vocal virus. Oh, you know what
I'm talking about. The girl holding
up the Starbucks line, ordering a
low-fat, unsweetened, iced soy latte
- wait, no, caramel latte. Wait, no,
vanilla latte - "and can you, like,
throw it in the blender? Thanks sooo
much." The girl in the library pout-
ing to her friend that "he doesn'teven
get my politicaljokes!" The nth girl to
walk down South Forest asking the
age-old question, "Howww can you
live above No Thai? And not eat it?
Like ... Every. Day."
Listen up, you'll hear it. They're
everywhere. A saleswoman at Nord-
strom asks if I need any help, and all
I can think is, "Dear Lord, ifa Bean-
ie Baby could talk, surely it would
sound like you."
My seemingly everlasting awk-
ward phase struck a climax in ninth
grade and was all the more exac-
erbated by the girls perched atop
the high-school hierarchy - a steep
climb up from where I was. Their
swishing ponytails gave me anxi-
ety. Their jingling car keys gave me
heartburn. They were older and cool-
er. And I was terrified of them, until
one day, I overheard them speaking.
Strange, I thought. What a peculiar
chorus of squeaky toys. I wondered:
Was it pretense? Perhaps a common
speech impediment? Granted, our
personal interactions amounted to
zero and to call us acquaintances
would be an uproarious overstate-
ment, but I had an instinct. They just
sounded so... unintelligent.
For years I was vexed. Why did
hearing a woman speak like Dee
Dee from "Dexter's Laboratory" on
helium feel like death by a million
paper cuts? Suddenly, my mission
was clear, and last Thursday morn-
ing, I stepped into the world for five
days as a sexybaby.
When attempting sexy baby voice,
it's not just about a high pitch. The
important partis includinguptalking
and elongated endings. You know,
as if everything you're saying is a
questiiiion? Vowel retraction is key,
along with sharpened, hiss-like "s"

sounds. "This" turns into "thessss,"
"stupid" to "sssstu-peh-d." Don't for-
get to include a vocal fry. Think grav-
elly register, scraping vocal cords
against a cheese grater. Say fry with
a fry. Go ahead, tryit.
While studying, I harassed my
friend David to tell me what he
thought of my new "accent." He
seemed a little bit too forbearing,
which unsettled me. Finally, I wrung
out a response: "Because you sound
like an idiot, I'd probably sleep with
you and never talk to you again."
He shrugged, returning to his video
game. I could barely muster an awk-
ward "thank you."
It was a rather thirsty Thursday
evening when I caught myself shout-
ing after my friends to stop power
walking and cursing the inventor of
stilettos. The next thing I knew, a
grody male specimen with a fratty
disposition walked past me and
addressed me with the utmost con-
viction: "DUMB BITCH!"
Naturally, my first thought was,
"Wow - I'm getting such good
data!" But the excitement of the
moment soon settled, and I was left
lagging behind the group, trapped
in my vocal affectation, vulnerable,
inferior, belittled.
I am not a dumb bitch.
But is this what girls are being
taught? That dumbing down for
men is OK? The human voice is half
of the persona. My vocal alteration
gave the impression to everyone
around me that I am less: less con-
fident, less pressured to be a great
thinker. It's as if the voice said,
"Relax, I'm not as clever or opinion-
ated as you. This'll be easy."
In public, I became the token
quiet friend. Embarrassed to speak,
my former outgoing self was substi-
tuted with a meek diffidence. I ate a
practically silent lunch with a friend
because she wouldn't - couldn't -
tolerate me. "You realize how annoy-
ing you sound?" she asked. Gingerly
nodding my head as I bit into a sand-
wich, I wondered how many friends
I'd lose over the next few days.
No one has been taking me seri-
ously. Even if the next words I spoke
were to be "I'm finishing my Ph.D. in

biophysics and I'm a two-time Ful-
bright fellow," eyes still glaze over.
Vague smiles crystallize. A mocking
tone is weaved into the distracted
response of whoever has the displea-
sureoftalkingtome. Men makejokes
about me in front of my face. Most
women feign interest, but judgment
waxes intheireyes. I findmyselfelic-
iting laughter in English class. Why?
Because I sound like a Dumb Bitch.
My professor would never admit it,
but it's true. He's thinking it. I see it
in his face when I speak in class and
I can't help but wonder: If this were
truly how I spoke, could I ever get
past a job interview? Would any-
body hire me as a criminal attorney?
Would someone choose me to be his
or her children's doctor?
The voice isn't only a communi-
cative medium - it's an implicative
one. Far past the age of women qui-
etly knitting pastel-coloredtea cozies
beside their husband, now is the time
of hasty assumption and easy access.
Baby wants, baby whines, baby gets.
Whatdoes the sexybaby voice imply?
What does it strive so hard to obtain?
Based on my findings, it certainly
isn't self-respect.
Perhaps Marilyn Monroe's
breathy, girlish tone mutated into
the voice of the Britney genera-
tion - and it just may have seeped
into the modern subculture of
young women today, generating a
self-deprecating, resounding echo
to the world. The damaged female
voice festers in high schools, uni-
versities, on TV and radio, slow-
ly claiming girls everywhere.
Now, I'm no die-hard feminist -
although the current state of my leg
hair would begto differ - but in my
opinion, women should sound like
women. Not dumbed-down, sexed-
up dolls who end every sentenceee
in a question? Let's climb out of the
vocal rut, women, and realize that
the way words are spoken is just as
important as what's being said. No
more "Dumb Bitch." It's time to rise
above the facade. It's time to re-
watch Legally Blonde. Ladies, are
you with me?

Panel to explore
media, feminism

Professors discuss
how scholars
engage with public
ByKATHLEEN DAVIS
Daily Arts Writer
As is often the case with pro-
gressive topics, feminism has
sometimes had a difficult tran-
sition from
the academic Feminist
world to the
general public.
There has been, Engage
however, an the Public
active effort to
make the topic Friday at
friendlier to a 10 a.m.
non-scholarly
audience. Fri- The League
day, the Univer- Free
sity will host a
panel discus-
sion featuring four acclaimed
professors who will discuss how
to bring the topic of feminism to
an audience outside of academia.
Lilia Cortina, a professor of
Psychology and Women's Stud-
ies at the University, will act as
panel chair for the event, facili-
tating discussion and questions
between the professors and audi-

ence.
"(The panelists) are academ-
ics used to publishing scholar-
ship in places like peer-reviewed
journals and scholarly books,"
Cortina said. "But we also value
opportunities to share what
we've learned through our schol-
arships and our research with
non-academics."
Four of the panelists - Anna
Kirkland, Sari van Anders, Maria
Cotera and Cortina - are profes-
sors in the University's Women's
Studies department, while the
fifth panelist, Jennifer Berdahl,
is a professor of Organizational
Behavior at the University of
Toronto.
Prof. Kirkland has recent-
ly published several articles
about the lack of correlation
between vaccines and autism,
while also studying gender and
weight discrimination in the
United States. Prof. van Anders
has been researching the link
between sex, intimacy and bio-
physiology, and Prof. Cotera
has worked substantially with
Latina/o studies, U.S./third-
world feminism and American
Culture. Each of these profes-
sors will discuss their research
within women's studies and
how to bring these issues to the

forefront of public discourse.
The event will be used as
an opportunity to discuss how
feminist scholars use various
forms of media and technology
to engage their work with mem-
bers of the public, and the pros
and cons of doing so.
Cortina is aware of the unfa-
vorable stigma the general pub-
lic has against feminism and
said she hopes the panel discus-
sion will help encourage those
unfamiliar with the subject to
expand their views.
"All of us are keenly aware
that the public at large usually
has views of feminism and fem-
inists," Cortina said. "These are
very narrow, based on myths
and very negative."
Along with the other profes-
sors in the panel, Cortina hopes
to bring a change to the concept
that feminism is an idea only ben-
eficial to women, and encourages
anyone interested in the topic to
attend.
"We think of feminism more
as a broader social justice move-
ment that's working to correct
various kinds of gender-relat-
ed inequalities," Cortina said.
"These are also linked with race-
related inequalities and class-
based equalities."

DailyArts Writer
Exploring your inner Christmas
country canbe difficult, especially
when the same Martina McBride
record has been orbiting your head
for one too many years. Search-
ing for anything to please your
extended Nashvillian family mem-
bers? Looking to educate yourself
on a stand-out classic that didn't
click with your generation? Every
expedition needs its kickstarters,
and yours should be no exception.
Lady Antebellum- On This
Winter's Night
Stir some light percussion,
delicate piano and the warmth
of a string orchestra to complete
preparation for a Christmas-ready
recipe. To any country listener
who frequents Need You Now,
it's evident that these are already
the iconic ingredients to Lady A's
sound. Impassionedballad-workis
the group's claim to fame, and the
holiday transition is barely a tran-
sition at all.
Rather than lullabying yourself
to relaxation with "Hello World,"
take the chance this winter to
heat the cocoa and sedate yourself
with Lady A's unexpected ballad
rendition of Mariah Carey's "All I
Want For Christmas Is You." The
track is Hilary Scott-exclusive,
vocally speaking, but Charles Kel-
ley's backup vocals initiate the
Grammy-winning harmonies that
charm fans through any season.
The 2012 record also features
an original number - the record's
title track, "On This Winter's
Night" Capitalizing on the mel-
ancholy piano themes of Own The
Night (particularly "When You
Were Mine"), the song narrates
the peaceful satisfaction of "this
winter's night." It's often said that
music is one of the few media that

can simultaneously draw opposing
emotions, and this Lady A original
provokes any number of holiday
feelings.
Originals and Mariah Carey
covers aside, the record isn't
astoundingly thought-provoking
(relative to other albums on the
Holiday charts), but certainly well-
executed. Charles, Hillary and
Dave carry a musical elegance that
flatters a Christmas studio album
finer than other neighboring coun-
try artists.

Paisley to budge in his musical

I have roughly zero qualms
admitting my love for all things
low-brow. I blast Bangerz in my
car more often than not, reli-
giously read Perez Hilton and
will stop whatever I'm doing to
watch any "Fast and Furious"
movie that happens to be on TV
(R.I.P. Paul Walker). That said,
it should come as no surprise
that I have a guiltless obsession
with the royal family of reality
television: the Kardashians.
When my interest with the
Kardashian klan was burgeon-
ing, I assumed I was enjoying
it solely through the ironic lens
of someone part of the genera-
tion that prides itself on over-
sized eyewear and an extensive
closet of Bill Cosby sweaters
(I'm guilty of both). This was
seasons ago when the family
adopted a monkey, Kim dated
Reggie Bush and Rob was still
hot. I kept my love affair low-
key and would lie to friends and
family, pretending that I didn't
know intimate facts about the
family. Yet here we are, almost
seven years later, and a still
can't manage to escape the
Kardashian k-void, which as of
late has caused me to sit down
and ask myself: Why do I insist
on keeping up with the Kar-
dashians?
Members of the family have
attributed their ungodly suc-
cess to their relatability, but
that seems like a stretch. I've
personally never been in a posi-
tion to casually drop $30,000
on a Birkin bag and, for what-
ever reason, no one gave me my
own clothing line at the age of
15. To be fair, that clothing line
would have consisted of bedaz-
zled graphic tees and ill-fitting
cargo pants. And, the last time
I checked, no one in my family
had a child out of wedlock with
one of the most famous musi-
cians of our time (I hear a few
of those One Direction boys are
still single, Mom). To top it all
off, my family has never been
offered a television contract
just for being us.
The aforementioned list only
scratches the surface of rea-
sons why people loathe this
family, claiming the show is a
cesspool of excess, ignorance
and debauchery - that could
very well be a direct quote from
my dad, but I'm not sure. To an
extent, I get it; 16 year-old Kylie

'Coven' cursed with
confusing racial politics

A lot of critics and pop
culture dissectors have
been tryingto make
sense of the racial themes in
FX's "American Horror Story:
Coven."
When I went
to jot down
my own
thoughts, I
was left with
a jumbled r
mess.
Set in
present-day KAYLA
New Orleans UPADHYAYA
and pep-
pered with
flashbacks to antebellum New
Orleans, race has been a part
of the show's thematic fabric
since the pilot's harrowing
opening scene. Kathy Bates's
Madame LaLaurie, a fictional-
ized rendering of the real-life
serial killer who tortured and
killed her slaves, brutalizes
a Black man she suspects of
sleeping with her daughter.
We're shown gratuitous shots
of deformed and bloodied vic-
tims - her seemingly bound-
aryless barbarity. It's slavery
as torture-porn. It's fucked up.
A few weeks after I saw the
premiere, "12 Years a Slave"
brought me face-to-face with
the depth of those indelible lac-
erations against Black bodies.
"Coven" doesn't confront that
depth or evoke the realness of
slavery's violence. Ryan Mur-
phy just wants to scare you.
Soon, we jump to the pres-
ent and meet Fiona Goode, the
Supreme (Jessica Lange, in all
her glory,) aka the Head Witch
In Charge of a powerful, albeit
dwindling, coven of witches.
We also meet voodoo queen
Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett,
in all her glory), an immortal
witch leader of a separate tribe.
With the exception of Queenie,
a young witch played by
Gabourey Sidibe, Fiona's coven
is entirely white, while Laveau
belongs to a long-standing line
of Black witches. "Coven," it
would seem, is Murphy and co-
creator Brad Falchuk's attempt
at tackling race.
But what is "Coven" trying to
say about race? With its para-
doxical messages and straight-
up misguided convictions,
figuring that out is about as
easy as diffusing a bomb while
blindfolded ... on rollerblades.
Ryan Murphy has always
been fascinated by oppressed
groups. "Glee" began as a
series for outcasts. The last
"AHS" chapter, "Asylum,"
doled out a searing critique of
the Catholic Church and a hor-
rifying glimpse at the violence
of homophobia. On "Coven,"
the witches are women, and
themes of power, sexism and
ageism ooze throughout. The
show wants so desperately to
comment on race and subjuga-
tion and privilege, but it seems
like no one in the writers room
really thought beyond "let's

DURHAM, NC - Rivalries
rarely disappoint. Tuesday
night was no exception.
A basketball rivalry that was
fueled during the Fab Five's
days was revived by the Fresh
Five. Even former Blue Devil
Grant Hill, who never lost to
Michigan's Fab Five, was in
attendance.
Anexchangeofphysicalplay,
foul language and even a ball
thrown at redshirt junior Jon
Horford by Duke's Quinn Cook
kept a packed crowd at Camer-
on Indoor Stadium entertained
until the final buzzer.
In the end, the Michigan
men's basketball team never
led No. 10 Duke in a 79-69 loss.
The Blue Devils (7-2) won the
tip-off and missed their first
shot, but outmanned Michigan
to get an offensive board and
put in the first bucket of the
game.
The Wolverines (5-3) were
disjointed in the first half.
They started the game shoot-
ing 1-for-5 from the field,
including two airballs and a
shot from Michigan forward
Mitch McGary that hit the side
of the backboard. With five

minutes left in the half, soph-
omore guard Spike Albrecht
was Michigan's leading scorer,
with just three points out of the
Wolverines' nine.
Sophomore guard Nik Staus-
kas, who played after sitting
out Michigan's previous game
against Coppin State with an
ankle injury, couldn't get open
in the first half. Senior Tyler
Thornton started covering
Stauskas and didn't let Michi-
gan's leading scorer out of his
sight.
Stauskas scored just three
points in the half - all from
the free-throw line. The guard
took just two shots in the half -
one from behind the arc, which
was an off-balanced attempt
as the shot clock expired that
didn't find the rim.
"We didn't get a lot of easy
shots, but we did get a few that
we missed early that could've
kept it where we wanted it
to be," Michigan coach John
Beilein said. "Obviously we
were missing Nik's normal
game. We just had trouble scor-
ing points without him."
Michigan knew going in that
its biggest advantage would
be in the paint, where Duke
lacks anyone whose size mir-
rors McGary's 6-foot-10 frame.

But McGary couldn't hold off
the Blue Devils by himself, and
Duke out-rebounded Michigan
23-15 in the first half, thanks to
six offensive boards.
Still, the Blue Devils didn't
run away with the game until
late as the Wolverines went
into the locker room trailing
just 32-22. Struggling to find
open shots in the second half,
No. 22 Michigan attacked the
rim. McGary put in an easy
bucket to start the half, and
sophomore guard Caris LeVert
used the extra 16 pounds he put
on over the summer to drive to
the bucket.
LeVert knocked down two
from the line early in the half,
and followed it with tough con-
tested layups and highlight-
reel dunks. He finished the
night with 24 points.
Michigan inched closer, but
was unable to close the gap.
With Duke limiting the Wol-
verines' looks from three, it
was too much to ask for Michi-
gan to get back in the game
with only two-pointers. After
LeVert knocked down a free
throw for an and-1 play to bring
the Wolverines within six, the
Blue Devils came back down
and drained back-to-back
3-pointers to give themselves

breathing room en route to a
14-4 run,
"They made two great threes
during that time and that was
a huge difference," Beilein
said. "Those (shots) miss either
time, this game could've gone
either way at that time. Big
makes by them and we couldn't
come back again after that."
On defense, the Wolverines
struggled to find an answer for
freshman Jabari Parker and
Cook,whohad 14 and20points,
respectively. Sophomore for-
ward Glenn Robinson did his
best to shut down the highly-
touted freshman, but Parker
lived up no the hype, showing
off an impressive NBA-like
ability to score at will.
"We we're not going to
give (Parker and Cook) a lot
of space, and we loaded up on
them as much as we could. We
paid for it. But we were not
going to let them get 26 and 28
and beat us."
With time expiring the Wol-
verines fought for loose balls,
hustled and fouled Duke to put
the Blue Devils on the line until
there was no time remaining.
When the clock hit zero, the
Wolverines walked away in
defeat, the rivalry very much
alive.

DURHAM, N.C. - On Tues-
day, a football school visited a
basketball school.
Duke and Michigan boast
traditions that have put them at
the pinnacle of their respective
sports over the years. When you
think college football, you think
the winged helmet, and when
you think college basketball, you
think of hundreds of blue-clad
students jumping and yelling.
Many high-schoolers choose to
come to the schools because of
the sports teams.
Michigan has its pregame
tailgates. Students line the Ann
Arbor streets blasting music,
imbibing and maize-and-blueing
all over the place. Then the thou-
sands of students flood Hoover
Street as they make their way
to Michigan Stadium for each
game.
At Duke, there's Krzyzewski-
ville.
Duke stu-
dents don't
have a 115,000- "It's M
seat stadium to
fill, so to earn wor
a coveted spot
in Cameron dedica
Indoor Sta-
dium, which
holds 9,000,
they pitch tents days in advance.
Students have created a make-
shift housing complex since Sat-
urday on a small grassy knoll at
the northeast corner of Cameron
Indoor. Groups that camp out can
include as many members as they
want, but a third of the bunch has
to be in K-Ville at all times.
Freshman Spencer Davidson
was there since Saturday at 1p.m.
He visited Duke as a sophomore
in high school in early January
and saw the students camping
out for a game against North
Carolina ... in mid-February. He
was hooked.
He applied to Duke, and on the
application writing supplement,
he wrote about the Krzyzewski-
ville experience.
Davidson found himself in
Ann Arbor for the Nebraska
game. He went to the tailgates,
took in the experience in the Big
House. He said he had a great
weekend.
Three weeks later, he returned
to Durham and set up his tent.
Smaller school, smaller sta-
dium, but just as big of an expe-
rience.
"What it is to me, is it's so
small, but that's the reason why
it's so crazy in there," Davidson
said. "You could be at the top of
the stadium, and you could feel
like you're front row. The aura, it
just never stops."
Just as Michigan football sea-
son tickets are passed down from

one generation to the next, Blue
Devil basketball is a matter of
lineage for many.
"I walked through K-ville
when I was 5 years old," said
freshman Emma Wright, whose
dad graduated from Duke. "The
first game I remember was in
sixth grade, and we were sitting
in nosebleed territory for the
Duke versus Maryland game."
Others, such as freshman
Lyndsay Garcia, intend on manu-
facturing a new family tradition.
"When I originally applied,
I never knew this was a thing,"
Garcia said. "Then everybody
starts talking about it, and you're
like, I should do it because it's
part of the Duke experience."
Garcia, who is from Dallas,
grew up on Texas Longhorn foot-
ball.
Getting accustomed to a big
basketball school took some time.
"People get really intense
about basketball here," Garcia
said. "I was always used to foot-
ball being the
big thing, so
when I came
lonths it was like, 'Oh
basketball,
th of that's kind of
weird, but I get
ation." it'
Not every-
one is so quick
to compare
Duke basketball to football tail-
gating, though.
Duke senior Adam Nolte vis-
ited his sister at Michigan earlier
this year and went to the Minne-
sota football game.
"It's just different," Nolte
said. "They're not really compa-
rable. Big Ten tailgating football
is like a one-day thing, whereas
the Cameron Crazies is a season
of tenting. It's months worth of
dedication."
Travis Fox, a sophomore, got
the No. 1 tent position for last
year's game against Ohio State.
That earned him and his friends
the right to sprint into Cameron
Indoor first as soon as the gates
open, so they could pick their
spots on the wooden bleachers.
He was at a LSU football game
earlier this year, where he said
there were more students tail-
gating than Duke has in its entire
school. He prizes, above the
sheer size of the football game
days, the intimacy of Duke bas-
ketball.
"I think it's easier to generate
a lot more enthusiasm around
sports when the teams are so
integrated within the school,"
Fox said. "When there's the
familiarity. When you're that
close to the stadium. When you
see players around. When it's
that small of a school, it is so
much easier to generate the kind
of unity you see in K-ville and in
Cameron."

Michigan baffledon oense

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
DURHAM, N.C. - Time
and again Tuesday night, John
Beilein looked defeated, which
made sense, because he had
been.
If it wasn't his hands folded
behind his head, it was his chin
in his hand, and if it wasn't that,
it was himwalkingto the referee
to call a timeout.
His offense, which had looked
so explosive in the early games
this season, had failed him in the
Wolverines' 79-69 loss to Duke
in Cameron Indoor Stadium.
Two airballs to start the game
certainly weren't a good omen.
On multiple occasions, miscom-
munications led to passes that
found the fourth row of the
Cameron Crazies student sec-
tion.
Even as sophomore for-
ward Mitch McGary drained a
long jump shot in the first half,
Beilein shouted "Not" as the

Wolverines ran back on defense,
voicing his displeasure with the
possession.
A few trips later, Beilein tried
to get a play in to freshman point
guard Derrick Walton. "Five!"
Beilein yelled as Michigan
advanced up court, only for the
raucous stadium noise to drown
out the sound as the call went
unheard and the Wolverines
wound up with another empty
trip down the floor.
On one possession, sopho-
more guard Nik Stauskas tried
to cross up Quinn Cook and only
crossed up himself. Stauskas
stumbled, and Cook took the
steal to the other end for an easy
layup.
And forget making 3-point-
ers, Michigan had a tough time
even shooting them. Blue Devils
coach Mike Krzyzewski had a
game plan to eliminate the Wol-
verines' 3-point threat, and it
worked to perfection.
"Stauskas gets a lot of shots
in transition, and they're a great

transition team," said Duke
guard Tyler Thornton. "So those
are the two things we wanted
to limit - transition shots and
3-point shots."
Stauskas, who was question-
able with an the ankle injury,
was stymied all night. Whether
it was the lingering pain hinder-
ing him from pushing off or the
Duke game plan, shot attempts
were nowhere to be found.
Despite playing 34 minutes,
Stauskas attempted just two
field goals, one a 3-point shot,
making neither of them.
Sophomore guard Caris
LeVert was the only Wolverine
able to generate offense, going
off in the second half for 20
points. He finished with 24 on
the game, highlighted by 7-for-7
free-throw shooting.
But he, too, wasn't even able
to manage more than a single
3-pointer.
"We tried to make sure that
we knew most of their offense,"
Krzyzewski said. "Then it's just

a matter of our kids working
real hard to make sure you try
to stop it. They still scored, but
it was tough to score against us
tonight.
Michigan was held to 3-for-
13 shooting from the perimeter,
and those numbers are a bit
deceptive, as two of those came
in the final minute as Beilein
tried to prolong the game by
fouling.
Between a 3-pointer by
sophomore point guard Spike
Albrecht in the opening minutes
and freshman guard Zak Irvin's
shot with a minute left, the Wol-
verines went three-less. For
a team that often relies, if not
survives on that shot, solutions
were limited.
"It was a great plan," Beilein
said. "They really tried to keep
Stauskas's touches very low and
not let him get into a rhythm.
Lock the rails on the sides so
that we had to score tough twos,
they did a great job with doing
that."

What We Learned: Ohio State

By ERIN LENNON
DailySports Writer
1. Big Ten hockey is going to be
fun.-
The carpetwas rolled out, liter-
ally, when Big Ten commissioner
Jim Delany dropped a ceremonial
puck with Michigan captain Mac
Bennett and Ohio State captain
Curtis Gedigon on Friday at Yost
Ice Arena.
With two contests flanking
The Game between the Michigan
and Ohio State football teams, the
first-ever Big Ten hockey match
ups between the third-ranked
Wolverines and the Buckeyes
were no less dramatic.
On Friday, with 16.2 seconds
remaining in the second period
of a tie game, junior forward Alex
Guptill scored Michigan's third
goal. The Wolverines held off
Ohio State for the first 16 minutes
of the third period before allow-
ing the game-tying goal to for-
ward Max McCormick.
Then, with 1:22 left in over-
time,sophomoreforwardAndrew
Copp took a pass from senior for-
ward Mac Bennett, found a hole
and fired a shot past the Buckeye
goaltender.
The largest crowd at Yost this
season, 5,800 fans, roared with
approval.
"It was definitely nice (to win)
and definitely cool to see the fans
on our side tonight," Guptill said
Friday. "It was just a lot of fun."
On Monday in Columbus, Ohio
State netted three unanswered
goals in the third period to erase
a 4-1 deficit.
Facing a potential second-
straight overtime in the Wolver-
ines' (10-2-1 overall, 2-0 Big Ten)
first Monday night game since
1982, Bennett scored the go-
ahead goal with 1:3S remaining in
regulation.
With some of the nations' most
highly-touted programs, the Big
Ten promises to be as entertain-
ing on the ice as on the gridiron.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Higher expectations?
Not so fast, says coach
By LEV FACHER crazy," Barnes Arico said. "We
Daily Sports Writer haven't faced that kind of length
or that kind of size all year long."

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Freshman forward JT Compher has four goals in five games, including four points in two wins against Ohio State.

2. Offense from the defense is
key.
Two weeks ago, Bennett took
time after practice to work on
his offense. Alone on the ice, the
captain fired shot after shot at an
empty net.
Bennett's game-winning goal
against Ohio State - his first
since March 9 - was the first tally
from the Wolverine defense.
This weekend, when the power
play failed to convert on five man-
advantage opportunities in the
series finale - snapping a five-
game scoring streak and marking
just the third time the unit was
held without a goal this season -
it was up to the defense.
The defense was also cred-
ited with the two game-winning
assists this weekend. On Friday,
Bennett's pass to Copp secured
the overtime victory, and Mon-
day, fellow defenseman Mike Chi-
asson aided Bennett in the tally.
"You can see the difference
it makes in a game," Berenson
said. "Our forwards aren't going
to score all our goals. Obviously
when the defense scores, it's a
good sign."
3. But defense from defense is
crucial.

The Wolverines skated without
a trio of defensemen - freshman
Kevin Lohan and juniors Mike
Szuma and Brennan Serville - on
Monday, and it showed.
The deficit forced junior for-
ward Andrew Sinelli to fill in on
defense.
A penalty kill that began the
season stopping more than 90
percent of power-play chances
is down to just 80.3 percent. On
even-strength opportunities the
Wolverines have been beaten in
the defensive zone, forcing the
goalies to block more than 30
shots per game.
Michigan went 5-for-9 on pen-
alty-kill situations this weekend
against the ninth-ranked Buckeye
offense, allowing three goals to
cross the line in the third period
Monday. And on Friday, the Buck-
eyes' second power-play goal was
a matter of freshman defenseman
Michael Downing leaving his
stick off the ice.
"Giving up three goals like
that, it's disappointing," Bennett
said. "Coach let us know in the
locker room, and we know that
too."
4. Compher and Guptill have
the hot sticks.
After two months of toying

with line pairings, it appears
Berenson has found a winning
combination.
On a line with Guptill and
senior forward Derek DeBlois for
the first time against Nebraska-
Omaha, freshman forward JT
Compher netted his first goal of
the season. Since then, Compher
has tallied five goals and four
assists in five games.
And on Monday, Compher
recorded his fifth multi-point
game of the season, scoring twice
in the second frame for his first
career multi-goal night.
"He's just competing hard, and
he's going to the net," Berenson
said. "He's scoring hard-working
goals, workmanlike goals, and
I think both his goals were on
rebounds tonight. But he had to
get there."
After a similarly slow start,
Guptill - who was pegged by
Berenson as a player in need of a
breakout season in September -
is feeling back in the groove. With
an assist Monday, Guptill also tal-
lied his fifth multiple-point game
of the season. In 11 starts this sea-
son, Guptill has five goals and five
assists.
"I'm a streaky player anyway,"
Guptill said. "It's nice to be able
to use my momentum to help the
team out."

Michigan women's basket-
ball coach Kim Barnes Arico is
guarded with her optimism, and
there wasn't much optimism to
be had when she lost her leading
scorer the day before the Wol-
verines' tilt with No. 15 LSU on
Saturday.
After losing junior guard
Shannon Smith to a back injury
in the second half of Michigan's
blowout win over Texas Tech,
keeping things respectable
against LSU seemed like a much
more reasonable expectation
than coming away with a win.
But the Wolverines met the
first expectation and came a pos-
session away from pulling off a
shocking upset to meet the sec-
ond. Barnes Arico, though, isn't
letting it reshape her assessment
of what she has referred to peri-
odically as a "transition year."
"I think it's a sign of things
to come," Barnes Arico said.
"Everybody's role became a little
greater (without Smith)."
It was not, in other words, a
sign that Michigan (5-3) is in a
position to contend for a Big Ten
championship a year or two ear-
lier than expected.
Signs of the Wolverines' youth
were still prevalent, even in
the process of taking one of the
country's top teams down to the
wire. Michigan gifted LSU the
basketball 23 times, any one of
which could easily have made
the difference in Saturday's
64-62 nail-biter.
To be fair, the Lady Tigers
brought the defensive pressure
throughout the night at the Bar-
clays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y.
When the Wolverines broke
through the press, the points
came, but the breakthroughs
were few and far between.
"They double-teamed us like

In Smith's absence, the other
two guards in Michigan's start-
ing lineup had no choice but to
step up, and they did so admi-
rably. Freshman Siera Thomp-
son scored 24 points on Friday
and added another 13 against
LSU, while sophomore Madison
Ristovski overcame an off night
against Texas Tech to add 13 of
her own in the tournament final.
"We looked at each other and
said that we're still a team ... we
can still do this," Ristovski said.
"I didn't try to put pressure on
myself, but I tried to max out my
game as much as I could."
Senior forward Val Driscoll
helped pick up some of the slack
as well, earning the start in
Smith's absence, racking up 11
rebounds and six blocks against
LSU. The lineup change worked
out well for the Wolverines, who
needed to go bigger to contend
with the Lady Lions' size.
Barnes Arico also cited fresh-
man guard Paige Rakers as a
player worthy of the fifth spot
in the starting lineup, but said
she felt more comfortable with
Driscoll's experience. "We feel
like (Rakers) is more comfort-
able, even a sparkplug for us
coming off the bench."
With or without Smith, it may
be naive to suggest that Michi-
gan didn't shift any expecta-
tions with its performance over
the weekend. They might not
be world-beaters, or even one
of the better teams in the con-
ference. But had Barnes Arico
seen into the future before the
season started and watched the
Wolverines go toe-to-toe with a
top-20 opponent, the "transition
year" buzzword might not have
become such a mainstay in her
repertoire.

This is further complicated when a
beterosexual man is assaultedby another
man and experiences arousal. Survivors
often question their own sexual identity
in such cases. And for many younger
victims, it is their first sexual experience.
Tellingsomeone
Both of Lyons' parents died in his early
adolescence. His mother committed
suicide and his -father overdosed on
heroin. His friends and family were quick
to comforthimabout these painfullosses,
but always shied away from his abuse.
"Ithought no one wanted to hear about
that," Lyons said. "People wanted to hear
about how torn are you, about how you're
going to survive. People wanted to hear
how I hadn't killed myself dssentially.
People didn't know and didn't want to
mksow, and I felt like it was a weird weak
thing."
Men abused as children confront their
experiences, on average, in their late 30s
or early 40s. Alterman said secondary
traumas are common for male survivors
- specifically, traumas that occur as a
result of telling someone of his assault
and experiencingsome sortofrejection or
questioning about if a survivor "enjoyed"
the experience.
"It's not just a question that someone
is asking of, 'Oh, did you enjoy it?'"

Alterman said. "Most people ask it in a
much more accusatory way of, "Oh, you
must have enjoyed it.' Then the question
is, 'Did I? Should I have? Am I wrong for
not?"'
Lyons, too, argued that societal
narratives limit men's ability to discuss
their experiences. The schema that men
are logical beings and women are hyper-
emotional contradicts the possibility of
male feelings.
"We have to tell men that it's okay to
talk about (sexual abuse), and that's hard
to do even when women are supposed to
be more emotional than men," he said.
"But even then, so many women still feel
like they can't talk about it. So if women
are supposed to have this space where
they can be emotional, what are men who
are supposed to be logical supposed to
do?"
Pursuing legal action is relatively rare.
However, conditions for men seeking
legal reparations for their abuses are
improving. Little, who studies male
survivors in the legal system, interviewed
75 attorneys who were involved in such
trials.
These lawyers were especially
galvanized by male victimization. Such
cases are relatively rare in the legal
system, despite their relative presence in
actuality.
"They actually seem to be intrigued by
cases involving male victims," Little said
of the lawyers she interviewed. "They

work a little bit harder. There's a great
sense of injustice that a sexual assault
could happen to a man."
Still, Little noticed something peculiar
with the mostly male attorneys: They do
not view themselves as potential victims
of sexual assault, unlike women. Jurors,
who also may not view men as possible
victims, must receive comprehensive
instruction that men can be targets of
sexual assault.
The environment that surrounds
male survivors of all ages drives many to
internalize their assault. There's often no
place to discuss one's problems..
"It's terrifying because everyday you
worry, 'Will someone find out about it?'
"Alterman said, his eyebrows furrowing.
"Everyday, 'Will someone see it? Will
it be discovered? Will someone realize
what's going on, realize I'm not a man
because of what happened to me? Am I
no longer worthy, am I no longer valid,
am I no longer ... human?"
A safe space
But anewnarrative is surroundingrape
- or it will be, if Alterman has anything
to do about it. He recently brought a Dare
to Dream event to campus, and he held
an open meeting after in the Michigan
Union.
"It's important whatwe as acommunity
can accomplish and that involves a much
larger conversation," Alterman said.

The male lawyers that Little
interviewed - and most men, for that
matter - don't give walking home in
the dark with headphones in or taking
drinks from strangers too much thought.
They don't, but experts suggest that they
should.
The focus of sexual violence
prevention, Alterman explained, is men
protecting women from violence. It's not
about protecting everyone from rape.
"The conversation about sexual
violence is, (how) can we use our power
to stop it? How can I stand up and fight
it?" Alterman said.
However, this does not fix the power
narrative.
"We can't just say, 'Hey men, use
the power that's causing violence and
use it to end violence,'" Alterman said.
"That's just taking the fire and pushing
it somewhere else. There's still the fire
there. It doesn't address the problem."
For those who have already endured
abuse, healing is possible. Both men say
that discussing their experiences and
educating others have helped more than
anything. Lyons is especially excited to
speak in a community of male survivors.
The Dare to Dream event in mid-
November was his first time speaking
about his abuse.
"Being through shitty things, it's
about learning to love yourself and,
above that, loving and accepting other
people," he said.

ILLUSTRATION BY MEGAN MULHOLLAND

When I was little I thought I was
the reincarnation of Pocahon-
tas. There were many explana-
tions for this delusion. First of all, I am an
only child (onlychildhood leads to fanatic
self-delusion born from a lethal combina-
tion of too much attention and too much
alone time). Second of all, the maple tree
in my backyard had a face. The face was
really just a mask that the previous resi-
dent of our house had nailed through the
bark. Why would you nail a mask on a tree,
you ask? Well, to give a sort of roundabout
answer to that question, I will describe to
you the aforementioned resident's idea of a
"funky yet functional" bathroom.
Prior to my parent's restoration, the
bathroom was the biggest room in our
entire house. It was furnished with all the
fixtures that a single woman in the 80s who
did a massive amount of cocaine would, nat-
urally, need. This included (but was in no
way limited to) a Jacuzzi hot tub, a sauna, a
bidet and a full-length wraparound mirror
that ran the entire periphery of the gigan-
tic lavatory. I remember being four years
old and getting the chicken pox. Thanks

to all the mirrors in the bathroom, I could
see every red blister on my body from all
possible angles. It was only my conviction
that I was Pocahontas which kept me from
going insane with misery when I was sick.
At any rate, there was a decades-old
weather-beaten face stuck on my backyards
tree, and I was fully convinced that it was
my own personal Mother Willow. I would
spend hours in the backyard talking to her
and trying to lure squirrels and birds onto
my shoulder with pieces of bread and war-
bled tribal melodies I made up. My mother
would watch me tenderly from the kitchen
window and try to convince herself that I
was going to grow up to be a totally well-
adjusted adult and not even a little bit serial
killer-y.
As I got older and started to talk to other
human beings more than flora and fauna, I
secretly saved my hope that I would even-
tually amount to something that was pretty
much equivalent to the reincarnation of
Pocahontas. I was realistic. I accepted that
Pocahontas was a historical figure, not just
a crownless Disney princess. I accepted
that she was specific to a certain time and

place that had come and gone. I accepted
that I was of Eastern European descent
and that I couldn't run barefoot through
the woods without making a sound or even
hear the colors of the wind (do they whis-
per navy or granny apple green?). Still, I
felt I would do something that would cause
people to look at me and say, "You know
who that girl reminds me of? Pocahontas.
Totally 100 percent Pocahontas."
Reality has been a tough pill to swallow.
Benadryl (what I was given when I had the
chicken pox) gives temporary relief and
makes pain and itchiness more bearable.
Reality, however, makes most discomfort
more acute and harder to deny. It seeps
into our bloodstream and slowly spreads so
that even if we wish our hardest to be chil-
dren forever, every artery pounds with the
knowledge that we have to grow up.
A couple summers ago, a series of power-
ful storms hit the Midwest. My parents and
I returned from vacation one day to find
that the tree I once knew as Mother Willow
had been hit by lightning. It now stood dan-
gerously close to falling through our roof.
When workmen came to fix the downed

electrical wires, they informed my parents
that the tree needed to become a stump. It
was time to say goodbye.
That night, I went out to the backyard
and sat in the dirt in front of my old friend.
I felt silly and incredibly sad. The 21-year-
old part of me said: what are you doing on
the ground? The kid in the back of my head
said: this tree had a face. It was special.
Are my dreams supposed to change now
that I set my own bedtime and fumble my
way toward a job? I don't want to be defeat-
ed by the civilizing forces in my life, but
stasis in the face of inevitable transforma-
tion has been proven untenable. So I try to
find small moments of strange, innocent
magic whenever I can: the way the fluo-
rescent "open" sign mirrors a sherbet dusk
or the satisfied wink my boyfriend's puppy
gives me when I scratch the soft spot under
its left ear. I run in a long and hurried flii ,
towards a place where I can be an adult, yet
still be myself.

The least reported crime
by Rachel Premack

4~ight after his girlfriend raped
him, she apologized.
"She had a boyfriend who told
er that girls shouldn't make noise
while they were having sex," Rackham
student Ben Alterman said, twisting
his pinky over his ring finger as he
discussed his second sexual abuser.
His memory of that day is foggy. He
can't exactly remember how he went
from her living room to her bedroom.
He was 16 years old.
"There was no conversation,"
Alterman said. "There was no, 'Is this
okay?' I felt trapped, I didn't have an
option. I didn't feel safe."
,Now an on-campus activist for male
survivors of sexual assault, Alterman
realized in recent weeks the likelihood
that his high school girlfriend was
abused herself - possibly by that
ex-boyfriend who insisted she stayed
silent during sex. That could explain
why she thought this sort of coercion
during sex was normal.
Alterman thinks consent is excluded
from the cultural conversation.
Grabbing a woman's hips from behind
is the requisite way to ask for a dance
-d movies show guys endlessly
pursuing a girl until she "gives in."
Many balk at the idea that men, who
are supposedly constantly sex-starved
and domineering, can be victims of
sexual assault too.
"As a survivor, I feel regularly
confronted with the question of, 'What
is masculinity and what is masculinity
in my life?' "Alterman said.
One in six
Rape of males is the least reported
crime, according to MaleSurvivor
Vice President Chris Anderson. This
organization was the first in the
country dedicated to helping men and
boys heal from sexual victimization.
Many of the statistics, for this
reason, are not definite. It's estimated
that one in 10 sexual assault survivors
are men. One in six men experience
sexual abuse before the age of 18.
In the case rape, 1 in 33 men are ,
compared to 1 in 6 women.
4j\ost issues that male and female
sexual assault survivors face - such
as guilt, shame or anger - after an
incident are similar, said Rackham
student Jamie Little. Little studies
the intersection between law and
male sex crimes in the Department of
'iociology.
Statistics reflect one difference

between the genders: the age in which
the crime occurs. Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Center
Director Holly Rider-Milkovich
explained that male survivors at the
University and at college campuses
nationwide are usually abused before
their college years. The most common
age for sexual assault for men is 8-18,
Rider-Milkovich said, compared to
16-24 for women.
Before being raped as a teenager,
Alterman was repeatedly abused as an
8-year-old by an older neighbor. The
neighbor would force him and another
boy to rub their genitals together in
Alterman's bedroom.
But for many boys, a close adult
- a. family member, coach, religious
official - is the common perpetrator

the funds - or do not recognize ma
rape or partner abuse as possible -,

Anderson said.
Stigmas shroud the true number
male survivors. However, Anders
said abuse does not discriminate.
"Sexual abuse affects people fro
every gender, age, race, religion ar
socioeconomic class," Anderson sai
"You will find them in all walks
life."
Internal struggles
Despite its pervasiveness, ma
rape is not commonly discusse
In fact, many male survivors fa
great difficulty in talking about the
experiences.

le masculinity: power. In a traditional
to view, he explained, the most venerated
es, men dominate athletically, are flush
in cash, and attract women. Men are
of valued for their ability to control or
on best others.
"The history that I feel as a man
m that I carry is one of power," Alterman
nd said. "I am taught to be powerful, to be
d. authoritative, to be controlling, to be
of aggressive."
Sexual assault takes that power
away. This can make some people
question if they are truly male when
they link power and masculinity so
le closely.
d. "You are subjugated by someone else
ce and done so in a way that is shameful
ir and creates a lot of self-loathing and
guilt," Alterman said.
Other effects of rape mirror
women's trauma: disruption of eating
or sleeping patterns, anxiety, low self-
esteem, depersonalization and a host
of other symptoms.
Lyons said the abuse, followed
by the death of his parents in his
adolescence, spawned certain
personality traits that seem almost
impossible in the gregarious
Residential College student.
"The big thing is being distrustful
of people, feeling like I've always had
to look out for myself, always being
a distrustful person," Lyons said.
"There've been a lot of times where
I've just been an asshole and it's not
okay. But it's also like at least three
different big fuckin' events in my
life that made me have to forge for
myself."
The question of sexual pleasure
can compound emasculation.
Anderson said men are biologically
driven to become erect with genital
stimulation, regardless of mental
state. Shock and terror can sometimes
te even lead to an erection.
ns Male ejaculation is also a physiological
is response that does not signify
he enjoyment or consent, similar to females
he who orgasm during rape. Alterman
of explained that he ejaculated as a 16
year old simply to make the experience
nd end. Still, this visible response can be
e. manipulated by rapists of men.
ke "It becomes a hook that perpetrators
se can use against a survivor to say, 'See,
su you enjoy this. This is something that
's you really wanted. This is natural, this
p, is what happens when people who like
each other touch each other in these
es ways,' "Anderson said.

of sexual assault. There's a "grooming"
process where the perpetrator
attempts to build trust with his or her

hough you'll _never hear it
chanted on a football Satur-
day, those sporting the Maize
and Blue have gotten a lot bet-
ter at going green since Uni-
versity President Mary Sue
Coleman made sustainability
one of her four presidential
initiatives in 2009.
In a2011 address, Coleman re-emphasized the
importance of sustainable practices by announc-
ing the results of an Integrated Assessment,
which investigated and suggested improvements
for the University and made a $14 million invest-
ment toward four main areas on campus: climate
action, waste prevention, healthy environments
and community awareness.
She then set University-wide goals in each of
the areas to be reached by 2025, including cut-
ting greenhouse emissions by 25 percent and
purchasing 20 percent of all University food
from local and sustainable sources - a goal that
has already been reached.
To say that the University's focus on sustain-
ability has flourished since Coleman made it a
priority would be an understatement. Though
measuring progress on the sustainability ini-
tiative is often more subjective than whether
or not the campus smoking rate has declined
or more students are studying abroad - two of
Coleman's other initiatives - fiscal year 2013
marked the sixth consecutive year that energy
conservation measures saved millions of dollars,
according to an annual energy consumption
report. While public funding for many proj-
ects has decreased in recent years, the amount
of sustainability research-related funding has
increased by 200 percent since 2003.
Don Scavia, director of the Graham Environ-
mental and Sustainability Institute and special
counsel to the president on sustainability, said
since Coleman placed an emphasis on the issue,
projects at the University have begun snowball-
ing, and students have become more active than
ever in sustainability initiatives. The Graham
Institute's mission is to bring facets of campus
together on sustainability initiatives.
The difference even in just two years, he said,
is marked - evident in the growth of institutes,
enterprises, departments, student programs and
clubs at the University dedicated to sustainable
practices.
"There are very few places that have the kind
of programs we do here at Michigan, at the scale
we have here," Scavia said. "Michigan is so well-
positioned to deal with it."
But student efforts are just the tip of the ice-
berg when it comes to implementing tangible,
eco-friendly solutions. The growing sustain-
ability culture on campus addresses operations,
construction and behaviors, as well as under-
graduate and graduate programming. The
"green" efforts have touched the University
of Michigan Health System and the Michigan
Athletic Department facilities, all of which have
been influenced by the president's ambitious
sustainability goals.

Scavia said Coleman was moved to take
action after she realized that the environment
would be the defining issue for this generation.
"It's critically important. It's the kind of thing
we can't do casually - we have to focus on it,"
Scavia said.
There are 640 sustainability-related course .
offerings at the University, reaching across
departments from the School of Art & Design
to the Ross School of Business, according to
the 2012 sustainability report. The Program in
the Environment major, often called PitE, has
been the fastest growing concentration at the
University for six years, according to Scavia,
and a minor in sustainability was added last
year to meet demand from students interested
in the topic.
Faculty across campus have incorporated
sustainability into their courses, an inter-
disciplinary approach that is critical if the
University wants to continue to prioritize sus-
tainability, according to Coleman.
"Sustainability is an area that presents
some of the most complex problems we face
- challenges that no single discipline will
solve," Coleman said in a recent statement to
The Michigan Daily. "We've positioned our
approach to be broad, including key research
activities and educating students how to apply
sustainability to all fields for the greatest
impact."
Mike Shriberg, the educational director of
the Graham Institute and a Program in the
Environment professor, said Coleman's pri-
oritization of sustainability allowed profes-
sionals and campus leaders interested in the
issue to pursue projects and research that oth-
erwise may not have come to fruition. While
many programs at the University have begun
incorporating sustainability into their courses,
broadening the interdisciplinary approach to
all corners of campus is his next objective.
Shriberg has been involved in sustainability
issues on campus for 15 years. He said, in the
past, there were "pockets of good activity,"
such as recycling and energy conservation
measures. However, he said having the presi-
dent of the University prioritize sustainability
allowed students, faculty and staff to pursue
ideas they otherwise may have considered pipe
dreams.
"I think what President Coleman did was
take those initiatives, leverage them up to the
highest level and provide resources to advance
them," Shriberg said. "When the president
says, 'This is something I value,' it opens all
kinds of venues for students, faculty and staff
across campus."
For Shriberg, the need for sustainability
isn't a niche topic or partisan issue - it's the
basis of existence, and needs to be a focus of a,
robust education.
"The president of Cornell said sustainability

is the frame of the liberal arts education," he
said. "That's'what I believe and I think Presi-
dent Coleman has helped move it in that direc-
tion. It's not so much that it's more important
than any other issue, but it underlies every-
thing else."
Scavia, too, said though there is little direct
top-down control at the University - which
was done specifically by administrators to
allow individual programs and colleges to do
as they see fit without running into bureau-
cratic red tape - Coleman setting sustainabil-
ity as a priority was critical to the progress the
University has seen in the past two years.
.So far, specific initiatives have largely
focused on changing individual behaviors on
campus, such as turning off lights and buying
sustainable produce, and basic institutional
changes, such as the purchase of seven hybrid
buses and the implementation of water refill
stations and "trayless" dining halls.
Last year, a campus farm was created at
the University's Matthaei Botanical Gardens
through the Sustainability & the Campus
course, which Shriberg teaches. Students also
created the "How to Be a Green Wolverine"
guidebook, which is available to all students
and provides tips on how to modify behaviors
for more sustainable living, produced using
recycled paper and ink. More than 10,000
guides were distributed in 2012.
Scavia said the University still needs to
improve on the operational side of sustainabil-
ity, which has proven difficult as the Univer-
sity continues to expand in size by one to two
percent each year. Total energy use increased
from 6.51 trillion BTUs in 2009 to 7.41 trillion
BTUs in 2012, though the amount used per
person per square foot of building space has
declined steadily by 22 percent since 2004,
showing a decreasing per capita ratio.
Additionally, 137 campus buildings con-
served energy in 2013, resulting in an 8.4-per-
cent energy use reduction.
Despite the continued expansion of exist-
ing facilities and construction of new ones, the
University helped to mitigate green gas emis-
sions from 2011 to 2012 through multiple chan-
nels, including expanding the North Campus
Chiller Plant, which saves money by serving
the whole area instead of relying on units in
each building. However, the original 2025
goal to decrease emissions by 25 percent still
stands. The University has reduced its waste
tonnage by about 1 percent according to the
2012 sustainability report - its goal is to hit 40
percent by 2025.
Certain sustainability measures, such as
carbon neutrality, are not feasible because of
the University's mission as a research institu-
tion and the continual need for improved lab
spaces and facilities, Scavia said.
"There's always an interesting balance
between our mission and these goals," Scavia
said.
That's not to say sustainability initiatives
in operations have not been undertaken. On

the contrary, various energy conservation and
waste reduction measures have been success-
ful. Five buildings on campus are LEED certi-
fied - including C.S. Mott Children's and Von
Voigtlander Women's Hospital, the Business
School, the Dana Building (home of the PitE
program), Crisler Center and the Law School's
South Hall - meaning they have achieved the
highest marks in human and environmental
health standards as verified by a third party.
The Dana building is Gold LEED certified,
as is Crisler Center, which is the second-high-
est level of LEED certification.
Since June 2010, all new construction proj-
ects undertaken at the University that exceed
$10 million must attain at least a Silver LEED
certification, according to Andrew Berki, the
manager of the University's Office of Campus
Sustainability.
Berki, who has led the Office of Campus
Sustainability since its creation in 2009, said-
though Michigan has led strong environmen-
tal efforts for years, Coleman's development of
University-wide sustainable goals was a criti-
cally important step forward.

mittee. Since then, the Athletic Department
has adopted a four-pronged approach to sus-
tainability, including waste reduction and
recycling; energy efficiency and sustainable
building infrastructure; water conservation
and chemical usage; and education and aware-
ness.
Energy efficiency is the department's biggest
focus, as energy saving measures not only help
the environment - they save money. Crisler
Center's Gold LEED'certification is a point of
pride for the department, Dunlop said, and
future construction projects will continue to
focus on sustainable measures.
According to statistics on the office of Cam-
pus Sustainability's website, each home game
at Michigan Stadium generates an average of
18 tons of waste, one-fifth of which is diverted
from landfills thanks to the efforts of the Uni-
versity of Michigan Football Stadium Recy-
cling Program, which was initiated in 1994.
Overall, in fiscal year 2012, more than one mil-
lion pounds of total waste were collected from
athletic facilities, including Michigan Stadium,
of which 40.8 percent was recycled.

Student Athletes for Sustainability, created
by Law student Courtney Mercier, a former
Michigan women's soccer player, was devel-
oped in 2012 to connect student athletes with
officials involved in sustainability initiatives,
and seeks to educate other student athletes on
the issues. A representative from the student
organization also sits on the Athletic Depart-
ment Sustainability Committee.
Though he acknowledged there is alot more
Athletics can and will do on the sustainability
front, Dunlop said in just 18 months, the Ath-
letic Department has made significant strides
in improving its practices.
"We went from literally not doing anything
to developing a plan, to organizing a commit-
tee, to putting it into action, to seeing results,"
he said. "We've really come a long way in a
short amount of time. I don't see sustainability
as a target, we've done it and we're done with it.
It's an ongoing part of our operations."
On the other side of campus, the University
of Michigan Health System was named one of
the 50 greenest hospitals in the United States
by Becker's Hospital Review earlier this year.
The recognition comes after UMHS com-
pleted 12 energy conservation projects in 2012,
including installing advanced air handling unit
controls and restructuring heating and cooling
schedules, accordingto UMHS's website.
Increasing sustainable practices in the Uni-
versity's hospital system is a priority for the

"While I'm proud of what our university has
accomplished during my tenure, our commit-
ment to sustainability has deep roots," Coleman
said. "We continue to build on the solid founda-
tion laid before and I anticipate much more to
come from U-M in the world of sustainability."
Sustainability will continue to be an impor-
tant issue for the next president to address,
building on Coleman's strong foundation.
"Who would be opposed to it?" Scavia asked.
Shriberg said working with peer institutions
such as Yale, Princeton and Harvard is one of
the best courses of action to further the objec-
tives of this "collective social goal." Addition-
ally, further integration across campus will be
vital for sustainable technologies to evolve.
"I think President Coleman has put a tre-
mendous amount of effort into a framework to
build from," Shriberg said.
Berki said students can expect to see addi-
tional hybrid buses added to the fleet as more
of the existing diesel buses are replaced. The
Office ofCampus Sustainability will also switch
from synthetic pesticides and herbicides to
more organic options for campus's green spac-
es, including the golf courses and lawn around
the Diag. There will be a continued push to
increase the purchase of locally grown sustain-

in the next president, someone who's really
focused on this and wants to advance the con-

said. "(Coleman) prefaced it well and is going <j

shape."
Still, O'Connell said there is much room for
improvement when the next president comes.
Specifically, she encourages the president to
consider longer-term changes beyond increas-

Following the example set by Ann Arbor City
Council, O'Connell hopes administrators invest
more in renewable energy sources and divest
from fossil fuel industries, though she admits
this is easier said than done.
"I would like to see a president who's think-
ing higher up," she said. "Looking through more
of a lens that's for the longterm, so how are we
going to benefit students 50 years from now?"
O'Connell and Shriberg emphasized the
importance of fostering student opportunities
in sustainability to help catalyze a larger cul-
tural shift in this generation toward creating.e
