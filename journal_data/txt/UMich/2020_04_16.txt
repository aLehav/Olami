On March 20, Acting Provost 

Susan Collins announced in an email 

that all undergraduate courses at 

the University of Michigan would 

be graded “Pass” or “No Record 

Covid,” with an option to withdraw 

from a course until April 21 without 

the course appearing on their 

transcript. Students will also have 

the option to unmask their grades 

by submitting a request by July 1.

In light of the new policy 

change, many students told The 

Daily they are concerned about the 

connotations of “P” and “NRC” on 

their transcripts when applying to 

upper-level admit programs at the 

University. 

The University undergraduate 

admissions 
website 
lists 
five 

upper-level 
units: 
the 
Dental 

Hygiene program at the School of 

Dentistry, School of Education, 

School of Public Health, School of 

Information and the Public Policy 

School. In addition, the School 

of Pharmacy offers a bachelor’s 

program, 
the 
Ross 
School 
of 

Business offers a business minor 

and LSA offers an Organizational 

Studies program students can apply 

to in their upper years. 

Art & Design freshman Emily 

Cao said she hopes to apply to the 

School of Information. According 

to Cao, she currently plans on 

unmasking all of her grades but 

expressed concern if she chooses to 

keep her grades masked. 

“If I do (choose) not to unmask 

one of my grades, I’m not sure 

exactly how the program will see it 

as,” Cao said. “They might question, 

‘Why did this person decide not to 

unmask this grade?’”

LSA freshman Megan Shohfi 

echoed 
similar 
sentiments 

regarding her plans to apply to 

both the Ford School of Public 

Policy and LSA’s Organizational 

Studies program. Shohfi said she 

thinks having the option to unmask 

grades is an added stress. Shohfi 

said she believes the new grading 

system does not have a large effect 

on students applying to upper-

level programs because they all 

aim to achieve a high GPA for a 

competitive application. 

Thousands 
of 
disgruntled 

Michiganders 
descended 
on 

downtown 
Lansing 
Wednesday 

afternoon 
to 
provide 
a 
new 

soundtrack to dissent amid a global 

pandemic: the blaring horn. Lines of 

cars and trucks miles long stopped 

traffic on the streets surrounding 

the Michigan State Capitol as 

part of “Operation Gridlock,” a 

protest organized by the Michigan 

Conservative Coalition and the 

Michigan Freedom Fund against 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s COVID-

19 stay-at-home executive orders. 

While 
the 
event’s 
Facebook 

page urged attendees to “STAY 

in your VEHICLES,” hundreds of 

protestors mingled on the Capitol 

lawn and surrounding sidewalks, 

holding signs and waving flags. 

American, 
Trump 
and 
“Don’t 

Tread on Me” flags were most 

common, with Confederate flags 

also interspersed. Speakers on the 

Capitol steps led a crowd below in 

prayers and chants like, “Lock her 

up!” 

Participants of the protest sought 

to voice anger over last Thursday’s 

executive order, which extended 

Michigan’s stay-at-home guidelines 

until April 30 and further restricted 

definitions of “essential” businesses 

and activities to slow the spread of 

COVID-19 in the state. Michigan 

has the third-highest number of 

cases in the country, with 28,059 

confirmed cases and 1,921 deaths as 

of Wednesday. 

Whitmer’s 
first 
stay-at-home 

order went into effect on March 24, 

and Republican members of the state 

legislature voiced their concerns 

about the impact of the extension of 

the order on the economy. State Sen. 

Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, said in 

a press release that the Michigan 

Senate Republicans trust residents 

to take necessary precautions on 

their own for themselves, their 

families and their businesses. 

A petition to recall Whitmer has 

been circulating and had 256,000 

signatures at the time of publication. 

The petition, started by John 

Powell, claims Whitmer’s “failures 

during the Covid-19 Corona Virus is 

causing more Michiganders to get 

sick.” 

Michael Hoover, who drove to 

the protest from Jackson, said he 

worried the latest order was an 

overstep on personal freedom.

“We cannot let fear dictate our 

liberties, because if we start letting 

things go because we’re afraid, then 

those things that we let go are going 

to be very hard to get back,” Hoover 

said. “And we have a duty to protect 

that.”

Hoover emphasized he believes 

many protestors were aware of the 

dangers of COVID-19 but think the 

state’s response has pushed too far.

University 
of 
Michigan 

alum 
Claudia 
Haimovici 

discovered the order-ahead 

food app Snackpass when 

the company launched on 

campus last spring. She said 

the launch was unsuccessful 

at 
the 
time 
because 
the 

company hadn’t partnered 

with 
popular 
restaurants, 

so she decided to join the 

company 
as 
the 
growth 

marketing manager.

“Why we want to do this is 

not because we want to go back 

to 
walking 
down 
the 
street 

and sniffing air like nothing’s 

happening,” Hoover said. “We 

want our rights to not be taken 

advantage of — we don’t have to 

ask the governor permission to 

do anything that the Constitution 

grants us.”

Many of the signs held by 

protesters in cars and around 

the Capitol expressed frustration 

with the order’s effect on small 

businesses. One sign read, “Small 

business is essential business.” 

Another read, “The government 

has no business telling you what 

is or is not essential to you.” 

Mark Schriemer, an alum of 

the University of Michigan, lives 

and works in Ann Arbor as a 

remodeling contractor. He said 

his business has been devastated 

by the restrictions, as he had to lay 

off all of his employees and resort 

to solo side jobs to keep himself 

financially 
afloat. 
Schriemer 

worried that Whitmer’s response 

was too broad geographically 

when the majority of COVID-19 

cases are tracked to Southeast 

Michigan. 

“You’re 
locking 
down 
the 

state for the sake of a problem 

that’s going on primarily in two 

counties,” Schriemer said. “She 

just hangs on her talking points 

and tells us all to just trust her 

that she’s saving all of our lives. 

And I’m not seeing the proof 

of that here. I’m seeing a lot of 

people going out of business and 

they’re never gonna reopen.” 

Public 
health 
experts 
have 

expressed support for Whitmer’s 

orders, saying the extension is 

necessary to fight the spread of 

the virus. In a statement, Vikas 

Parekh, associate chief clinical 

officer for Michigan Medicine’s 

adult hospitals and professor of 

internal medicine, said reducing 

contact for an extended period 

of time is essential to drive the 

number of cases in the state down.

“The 
data 
confirm 
that 

everyone in Michigan can help 

us flatten the curve, and it is 

crucial,” 
Parekh 
said. 
“In 
a 

scenario where the virus spreads 

throughout the local population 

infecting the majority of the 

population, 
our 
model 
shows 

tremendous differences between 

less and more aggressive social 

distancing.”

Dan Garrison of Jackson said 

he attended the protest because 

he has seen his small business 

officiating weddings and his part-

time job officiating high school 

sports dry up over the last month, 

and many of his friends have lost 

work as landscapers and lawn 

care providers. 

“I agree with parts of it — 

social distancing — absolutely I 

do,” Garrison said. “I agree with 

the whole concern with health 

and welfare, people’s well-being, 

I do. But I just think that she 

should have made exceptions on 

particular jobs that people need 

to do.” 

Whitmer 
addressed 

protester 
frustrations 
in 
a 

press 
conference 
Wednesday 

afternoon, acknowledging their 

economic fear as real while also 

encouraging 
small 
business 

owners to start thinking of plans 

to safely reopen.

“How 
does 
that 
particular 

business protect their employees 

and their customers?” Whitmer 

said. “Now is the time to throw 

our energy into planning, because 

we know that COVID-19 is not 

going to be gone on April 1 or 

May 1 or July, June, or August 1. 

This is a virus that will continue 

to spread unless we all do our 

part. That’s why, as we think 

about re-engaging sectors of our 

economy, it’s going to be really 

critical that we have confidence 

that we can do that safely.” 

According 
to 
a 
Michigan 

Nurses 
Association 
statement 

from Tina Ray, Ambulance traffic 

to 
Sparrow 
Hospital, 
located 

on Michigan Avenue a mile east 

of the Capitol, was impeded by 

the protest. Ray expressed her 

concerns about having protests 

during the COVID-19 pandemic, 

stating 
it 
prevents 
medical 

professionals from doing their 

jobs. 

“While everyone has a right 

to 
gather 
and 
express 
their 

opinions, today’s protest sends 

exactly the opposite message 

that 
nurses 
and 
healthcare 

professionals are trying to get 

across: we are begging people, 

please stay home,” Ray wrote. 

“The protest was irresponsible, 

impeding ambulances and traffic 

to 
Sparrow 
Hospital, 
where 

frontline healthcare workers are 

risking their lives taking care of 

patients suffering from COVID-

19. Lives are being saved because 

of the stay-home order. We ask 

everyone to protect themselves, 

their families and us by doing 

what’s best for the greater good.”

Greg Moore, an Okemos native, 

took his mother to Sparrow 

Hospital on Wednesday for stage-

four cancer treatment. Moore 

was upset by the fact that he had 

to weave through traffic and take 

side streets to get to the hospital 

and said the protest crossed a 

line. 

“I don’t think it really falls 

under peaceful protest, I don’t 

think it falls under a protest that 

doesn’t cause a disturbance,” 

Moore said. “So I think it should 

have been disbanded … there are 

probably other ways of protesting 

this that don’t involve blocking 

hospital entrances.”

Protesters on the Capitol lawn 

and surrounding sidewalks did 

not follow the Centers for Disease 

Control and Prevention social 

distancing guidelines of staying 

at least six feet from other people, 

avoiding gathering in groups and 

staying out of crowded places. 

Tiffany Brown, press secretary 

for Whitmer, emphasized before 

the event that the governor will 

always defend free speech, but 

asked that “those who choose to 

protest these orders to do so in 

a manner that doesn’t put their 

health or the health of our first 

responders at risk.” 

At 
the 
press 
conference, 

Whitmer addressed the possible 

health 
consequences 
of 
the 

protest. She said that in addition 

to causing the hospital difficulties 

and bus service reroutes, the 

gathering could lead to the spread 

of COVID-19.

“We 
know 
that 
this 

demonstration is going to come 

at a cost to people’s health,” 

Whitmer said.

“It already did in those two 

examples (of hospital and bus 

troubles), but we know that when 

people gather that way without 

masks — they were in close 

proximity, they were touching one 

another — that’s how COVID-19 

spreads. The sad irony here is that 

the protest was that they don’t like 

being in this stay-home order and 

they may have just created a need 

to lengthen it, which is something 

that we’re trying to avoid at all 

costs.”

On the Capitol lawn, Art & 

Design 
sophomore 
Mckenzie 

Balaka, 
fundraising 
chair 
for 

College Republicans, took part in 

the protest with her mom. When 

asked about the apparent lack of 

social distancing, she said she was 

not worried. 

“I 
think 
based 
on 
what 

they’ve said to us, if you’re 

immunocompromised you need to 

wear a mask and probably shouldn’t 

come out today,” Balaka said. “Like, 

my uncle has asthma. But if you’re 

not immunocompromised, we’re 

all fine. I think we’re all okay.”

Immunocompromised 
people 

are at heightened risk of coming 

down with severe cases of COVID-

19. 
However, 
people 
without 

any underlying conditions may 

contract 
more 
mild 
versions 

of the disease and could act as 

asymptomatic carriers.

Not everyone gathered at the 

Capitol 
Wednesday 
opposed 

Whitmer’s 
orders. 
Christian 

Bartolo, a student at Grand Rapids 

Community College, held a sign on 

the Capitol lawn that read, “You 

weren’t this angry @ Snyder 4 

Poisoning Flint.” 

Bartolo said he’s keeping his 

social distance and trying to stay 

six feet away from people, but 

noticed others were not holding 

themselves to the same standard.

“They’re all shaking hands, 

they’re all hugging each other, like, 

this is how coronavirus spreads,” 

Bartolo said. “I think that your 

boating rights, being able to fish 

while on a boat, being able to buy 

mulch and buy planks of wood is 

less important than keeping people 

safe from COVID-19.”

As cars rumbled over nearby 

Michigan Avenue en route to the 

Capitol, a man sat alone along the 

banks of the Grand River, taking in 

the sounds of “Operation Gridlock” 

from a distance. Dan Walker, in his 

58 years, never thought the world 

would come to anything like the 

COVID-19 pandemic. He said he 

doesn’t trust a lot of government 

systems, no matter the country. 

“Some people say it’s gonna get 

better, some people say it’s gonna 

get worse,” Walker said. “I’m just 

sitting back and watching and 

listening.”

However, he said the orders are 

in place to keep people safe. 

“All those people up there are 

probably spreading the virus,” 

Walker said. “They’re spreading 

it, so what is it really helping? 

I don’t know, man. It’s got me 

perplexed.”

“As a (University of) Michigan 

student, I was like, ‘OK, this is such a 

great app, let’s bring this to as many 

stores as possible and as many stores 

that people really like,’” Haimovici 

said. “At the end of the day, this is for 

the users and we want to have the 

right restaurants for them.”

Since its launch, Snackpass has 

partnered with more than 30 Ann 

Arbor businesses, including Wild 

Poké and Zingerman’s Delicatessen. 

Haimovici said the app distinguishes 

itself from other ordering apps like 

Uber Eats and DoorDash with the 

app’s Venmo-like social feed. The 

feed allows users to gain rewards for 

visiting restaurants and send them 

to friends.

Haimovici also said the app 

doesn’t 
deliver 
food, 
which 

eliminates commission fees and 

forces users to interact with the 

business. 

“College 
campuses 
are 
just 

more condensed areas, and people 

are always going back and forth, 

whether it’s back to the library or 

on the way to class, and so a lot of 

people just don’t have enough time 

to wait in line or sit down to grab a 

meal, so it’s the perfect way to order 

ahead,” Haimovici said. “(The feed 

is) really fun and huge for the college 

environment because people are so 

into social media and looking at what 

everyone else is doing.”

LSA sophomore Emma Wong 

downloaded the app last March 

after seeing flyers around campus 

advertising 
the 
app. 
She 
said 

ordering is more convenient with the 

app, adding that the feed makes the 

process more fun.

“I like Snackpass because you 

could order in advance and then 

when you go to pick it up, it’s already 

ready, so it’s definitely nice,” Wong 

said. “I think (the feed is) kind of 

a fun feature of the app as well 

because when I go to restaurants a 

lot of times, I get a reward. I think 

things like that definitely make the 

app a lot more fun and gives people 

a reason to use it.”

Brian Kung, co-owner and general 

manager at Wild Poké on East Huron 

Street, said his business began a 

partnership with the app last March. 

He said he hasn’t seen an effect on 

his business yet, but he hopes the app 

will lead to more foot traffic. 

“We are always trying to find 

services to attract more foot traffic 

to our location, and we like that 

Snackpass is not a delivery service, 

so customers have to come to our 

store,” Kung said. “The social feature 

of the app is also interesting, but we 

haven’t seen any direct impact from 

that part of the service.”

Jennifer Hall, assistant to the 

managing partner at Zingerman’s 

Delicatessen in Kerrytown, wrote 

in an email to The Daily that her 

company began a partnership with 

the app last September and it has 

helped her off-campus business get 

more student traffic. 

“We know that we are off the 

beaten path for many students,” 

Hall wrote. “We’re always looking 

for ways to make our delicious 

reubens 
and 
other 
sandwiches 

more accessible to the campus 

population. Snackpass helped bring 

our restaurant closer to students 

by making us more visible to them 

through their app. We’re really 

thoughtful about the companies we 

choose to work with, and Snackpass 

is a good fit for us as they share 

many of our same values.”

Wong said she has tried new 

restaurants like Snap Custom Pizza 

and plans to visit restaurants farther 

from campus in the future. She said 

she doesn’t think the distance to 

off-campus restaurants will pose an 

obstacle.

“People 
love 
getting 
food 

delivered 
to 
their 
house 
or 

apartment, but Snackpass, I feel 

like, just makes the ordering a little 

bit more expedited … when you 

want to pick something up, and I 

don’t really mind that it doesn’t 

have a delivery option,” Wong said. 

“I think maybe in the future I will 

try some of the other restaurants 

that are further away.”

Haimovici said the app also 

provides users with promotions and 

discounts. She said this strategy 

brings in new customers when they 

hear about discounts from friends 

or learn about new menu items.

“Those kinds of discounts are 

really meant to get people talking,” 

Haimovici said. “Because it’s so big 

and, in general, it’s going to bring 

a lot of new customers into that 

restaurant.”

Haimovici said the app has 

provided prospective partners with 

free online ordering services during 

the COVID-19 pandemic. She added 

that the company’s cultural mission 

has been affected.

“Culturally, it’s impacted us in 

that a lot of college students have 

left campus, so obviously that 

kind of (changed) our marketing 

strategy,” Haimovici said. “One 

thing we are working on is really 

spreading local outreach because 

we want Ann Arbor locals to use our 

platform, not just college students.”

Since classes moved online, Wong 

said she hasn’t used Snackpass in 

about a month since she left campus 

as her hometown doesn’t have any 

partner businesses. 

Hall and Kung also said they’ve 

seen a decrease in business. Hall 

added that though there isn’t as 

much 
activity, 
her 
company’s 

partnership with the app has helped 

them adapt to the situation.

“I would say that our partnership 

with Snackpass has been incredibly 

helpful during this pandemic,” Hall 

wrote. “Since all of our ordering and 

paying is happening with no contact 

right now, that means that more 

people are ordering online. We are 

glad we already had this system in 

place before we were required to 

close for in-house dining.”

Haimovici said the app will 

continue to support businesses 

during 
the 
pandemic. 
She 

highlighted 
her 
company 
isn’t 

collecting 
commissions 
from 

partner businesses, unlike the app’s 

competitors.

“100 percent of the orders are 

going to go to the restaurants right 

now,” Haimovici said. “It’s just 

a really good way to support our 

businesses during this time.”

“It’s kind of always in the back of my 

mind that I’m competing against other 

students who probably will unmask 

their grades,” Shohfi said. “So, it seems 

almost pointless to have the option to 

pass/fail it or unmask it, because I have 

to do everything I can to boost my GPA 

for these programs I’m applying to.” 

LSA freshman Lizzy Peppercorn 

said she will be applying to the Public 

Policy School and is in favor of the 

current grading scale to accommodate 

the pandemic. Peppercorn said when 

evaluating applications for all students 

affected by the COVID-19 crisis, 

institutions should continue to be 

flexible. 

“I like the way they’re doing it, so 

long as these upper-level admission 

programs keep in mind that there are 

certain people that have advantages 

with resources or are dealing with 

stressful home lives,” Peppercorn said. 

Peppercorn noted it is important 

students’ transcripts reflect their hard 

work, but also some students may 

have advantages over others due to 

additional resources. 

“I think it’s important that if you’ve 

put all this work into this semester, it 

should help your GPA,” Peppercorn 

said. “But it shouldn’t hurt people who 

don’t show their grades at all. … Also, 

I think there is cheating going on, so I 

think that people that are more social 

can reach out to more friends and get 

that help. There’s a lot more benefits 

that people are getting.”

The Business School notes they 

are closely monitoring the pandemic 

and 
will 
make 
accommodations 

where needed. Organization Studies 

said prerequisites with a “P” will be 

accepted for the Winter 2020 semester 

with more information being released 

in the future. 

In an email to The Daily, Elizabeth 

Birr Moje, dean of the School of 

Education, 
provided 
a 
statement 

regarding the evaluation of applicants. 

“The 
School 
of 
Education 

understands that students applying 

to our programs will have COVID-

affected grades and we will not 

consider those grades a weakness in 

any student’s application,” Moje wrote. 

“Just as we have seen with the preK-

12 students and teachers with whom 

we work, this crisis unequally affects 

our population. We understand that 

there are numerous reasons students 

may not wish to unmask grades this 

semester, and we are supportive of 

the University’s decision to establish 

grading as they have.”

Administrators 
from 
both 
the 

Pharmacy School and the Public 

Policy School told The Daily they will 

maintain flexibility and not make 

negative inferences on this semester’s 

grades.

Mark Nelson, assistant dean for 

student services and admissions at 

the Pharmacy School, said many 

institutions are deciding how to handle 

this semester.

“This conversation is happening 

all across the country,” Nelson said. 

“I’ve been on more webinars, I’ve been 

on more conversations, I’ve received 

dozens of emails from different schools 

and hundreds of emails from students 

asking all the same questions. The 

tricky thing is that every organization is 

going to do something different in how 

they’re going to address how we reduce 

the anxiety of our students during this 

pandemic with something like grades.”

Beth Soboleski, associate director 

of student and academic services at 

the Public Policy School, said this is an 

unprecedented time in history and the 

administration is trying to be as fair as 

they can. 

“This is outside of all of our control,” 

Soboleski said. “This situation is just 

something that we’ve never had to deal 

with before. Most times, students have 

the option to make a class pass/fail, 

but in this case, there are no options, 

so it doesn’t make sense to … penalize 

or make assumptions about that 

situation.”

According to Soboleski, the Public 

Policy School will look at students’ 

applications holistically and the option 

of unmasking or masking grades rests in 

the students’ hands.

“We’re totally leaving it up to the 

students,” Soboleski said. “If a student 

says, ‘I think I would like people to see 

these grades,’ that is completely their 

decision. But we’re not going to infer if 

somebody chooses to not unmask that 

it’s, in some way, a negative situation. 

Our goal is to hold folks harmless as 

much as we can.”

Despite these assurances from other 

institutions and hoping others will 

follow suit, Cao said there is no way to 

fully know how their applications will 

be evaluated. 

“I feel like even though they say it, I 

still fear they might take it a different 

way because they might still wonder 

why we decided not to unmask this 

grade,” Cao said. “Even if they say it, 

we don’t really know what the specific 

school is thinking.”

Shohfi said knowing other applicants 

might unmask all their grades still puts 

pressure on her to do well and unmask, 

even if admission policies say otherwise. 

“Even though they say that having 

a ‘Pass’ is fine, to me, just knowing 

that a lot of students will have an A or 

a B versus a ‘P’ on their transcript does 

make a difference to me,” Shohfi said. 

“It has influenced me to keep my grades 

up at the end of the semester because 

I’m going to reveal them.”

Nelson said he recognizes these 

concerns and knows there still will 

be anxiety surrounding applications. 

He said he believes it is up to the 

professional institutions to be clear 

and consistent on their policies to 

help alleviate stress and encourages 

students to take advantage of the new 

grading policy. 

“You guys have the power to 

manipulate your GPA, which is kind 

of awesome,” Nelson said. “And what 

the administration is saying, and I’m 

hearing this loud and clear — trust 

it. Just take it for what it is and don’t 

spend time thinking about it. I hope 

that many (other) schools will do that. 

We certainly are.”

G

oing into the summer, for many 

of us, means even more changes 

in an increasingly turbulent 

pandemic. Coronavirus hotspots are 

shifting, and those who are left on campus 

will soon be returning to their hometowns, 

for better or worse. As Michigan continues 

to see increasingly deadly days, it is vital 

that we keep in mind the groups at highest 

risk, including LGBTQ+ people.

Just about everyone 
is 
struggling 
in 
some 

form or another because of self-isolation 

and stay-at-home orders, but queer people 

are especially predisposed to loneliness 

and depression, as my fellow columnist 

Owen Stecco wrote recently. As many as 

60 percent of LGBTQ+ people struggle 

with depression or anxiety, both of which 

are easily exacerbated by this pandemic. 

Stay-at-home orders also worsen issues 

common among queer people regarding 

family environments. Only a quarter of 

LGBTQ+ 
youth 
reported 
having 
supportive 

families, and just under half of openly queer 

youths were made to feel bad about their 

orientation 
by 
their 
families. 
The 
University 

of Michigan, like many other universities, 

urged students to leave campus if at all 

possible, but just because students are 

physically capable of going home doesn’t 

mean they should — not that it will matter 

when the semester ends in a few weeks and 

they have to go home anyway. This doesn’t 

even address the students who don’t have 

a home to go back to, as 40 percent of 

homeless youth are LGBTQ+. 

In truth, returning to the closet and/or 

going back to a bigoted family is the safest 

option for many LGBTQ+ people, provided 

they have the option. While it is true that 

young people are less likely to die from a 

case of COVID-19, age is far from the only 

survivability 
factor 
— 
things 
like 
preexisting 

conditions and access to medical care 

matter just as much, if not more. Gay and 

bisexual men and transgender people are 

drastically 
more 
likely 
than 
other 
Americans 

to have HIV and, therefore, a compromised 

immune system. More than one in five 

transgender 
adults 
have 
a 
chronic 
condition 

(diabetes, asthma, etc.), a major risk factor 

for coronavirus patients. The same trend 

can be seen in LGB adults. To complicate 

things further, those who are LGBTQ+ are 

less likely to have health insurance than 

those who are not. This serves to worsen 

the severity of said chronic conditions and 

deter individuals from seeking care if and 

when 
they 
contract 
COVID-19, 
despite 
their 

heightened risk of death.

Perhaps the greatest risk factor for 

queer people during this pandemic is 

respiratory issues. Breathing trouble is 

a key symptom of COVID-19, hence the 

desperate need for respirators. LGBTQ+ 

people have enough trouble breathing 

as it is — and it’s not just the prevalence 

of chronic conditions that sometimes 

happen to be respiratory. A lesser-known 

fact is that LGBTQ+ people are roughly 

twice as likely to smoke as their cisgender 

and heterosexual counterparts. Smoking 

increases the chance of both contracting 

the virus (due to higher risk of chest 

infections and frequent hand-to-mouth 

contact) and experiencing complications 

once sick. Breathing issues virtually 

exclusive to the LGBTQ+ community 

are those related to chest binding, a 

practice used by many transgender men, 

nonbinary people and sometimes butch 

lesbians to flatten their chests. One of the 

many potential health problems caused by 

frequent binding is shortness of breath. 

These and many other medical needs 

of the community are being put on the 

back burner as states order the indefinite 

postponement of “nonessential” health 

care services. Michigan’s order dictacts 

— as the bare minimum that must be 

postponed — joint replacements, bariatric 

surgeries and any dental care that does 

not “relieve pain or infection”; in Texas 

and many others, this has been made to 

include abortion despite its time-sensitive 

nature. 
With 
these 
procedures 
constituting 

the minimum for cancellation, it comes as 

no surprise that transgender health care 

makes the list as well. Gender-affirming 

surgeries, which already have a long wait 

period due to the small number of surgeons 

doing them, are being delayed even further 

because of COVID-19. These procedures 

are often vital to the health and safety of 

transgender people, who see decreases in 

anxiety, depression and suicidal behavior 

as well as a decreased likelihood to smoke 

or abuse drugs — factors that are more 

important than ever during this pandemic. 

This quarantine period would be ideal for 

recovering from surgery if only people 

could get them, and forget about trying to 

start hormone therapy.

If LGBTQ+ people are more likely to 

be hospitalized over a case of COVID-

19, what happens to them once they 

get there? As overwhelmed hospitals 

begin to ration life-saving equipment, 

prospects are bleak. One rationing 

method is to give lower priority to 

patients with underlying conditions, 

which would disproportionately affect 

minorities, particularly Black people, 

but also queer people. No matter what 

method is used, though, they all hinge 

on prioritizing those most likely to 

survive short-term and long-term. 

As if the heightened suicide risk in 

the LGBTQ+ community wasn’t bad 

enough on its own, it could very well 

become a deciding factor in denying 

people life-saving resources because 

it compromises the odds of long-

term survival. Even if this could be 

controlled for, doctors have strong 

implicit biases against queer people, 

making them unlikely to prioritize gay 

and transgender patients regardless of 

how resources are officially allotted.

Now more than ever is the time to 

think of others. The vast majority of 

us personally know someone who is 

LGBTQ+. Keep them in mind when you 

debate going out or wonder if you really 

need to wear that mask. Wash your 

hands, keep your distance and stay home 

unless absolutely necessary — and, of 

course, have the best summer you can, no 

matter who you are.

LGBTQ+ health amid the pandemic

rajemian@umich.edu.

F 
 

ollowing 
the 
recent 

announcement 
of 
his 

departure from the 2020 

presidential campaign, Sen. Bernie 

Sanders, I-Vt., has left many of his 

supporters yearning to see a similarly 

progressive agenda from former Vice 

President Joe Biden. I understand 

the frustration his supporters feel 

when the candidate whose agenda 

we deem incomparable to Sanders’s 

has now become the only option for 

the Democratic vote in the upcoming 

presidential election. However, as 

we come to realize that the ideals 

of Biden and Sanders stem from 

the same Democratic principles, 

we should act on the promises that 

Biden’s campaign makes for climate 

change. In a world where political 

divisions resemble the separation 

between environmental prosperity 

and 
environmental 
destruction, 

we — as supporters of Sanders’s 

Green New Deal, as humans and as 

stewards of our future — should now 

turn to support Biden for President of 

the United States.

One of the most prominent 

similarities between Biden’s and 

Sanders’s 
approach 
to 
solving 

the climate crisis is utilizing the 

framework of the Green New Deal 

to enact the necessary changes for 

improving our society. For Sanders, 

the Green New Deal pushes for 

legislation during the next decade 

to factor climate change “into 

virtually every area of policy, from 

immigration to trade to foreign 

policy and beyond.” For Biden, 

the Green New Deal captures two 

defining truths for his campaign: 

“(1) the United States urgently needs 

to embrace greater ambition on an 

epic scale to meet the scope of this 

challenge, and (2) our environment 

and our economy are completely 

and totally connected.”

Both 
candidates’ 
approaches 

acknowledge how all people will 

be affected by green legislation that 

alters the landscape of the workforce. 

For 
Sanders, 
ensuring 
a 
just 

transition for all energy workers and 

for frontline communities is the first 

step toward addressing economic 

injustices in our country. For Biden, 

fulfilling an obligation to all workers 

affected by the national energy 

transition is a commitment that our 

government cannot relinquish. 

The 
bold 
agendas 
of 
both 

candidates promise confrontation 

with fossil fuel giants that have 

exploited 
communities 
across 

our country. For Sanders, it is 

imperative that the government 

holds accountable the fossil fuel 

corporations that “... knowingly 

destroyed our planet for short-

term profits” throughout the past 

decades. For Biden, the government 

should not only reprimand the greed 

of the fossil fuel industry but also 

“develop solutions for environmental 

injustices affecting communities 

of color [and] low-income and 

indigenous communities.” 

The most important comparisons 

between both candidates’ agendas 

are their commitments to 100 

percent clean energy and net zero 

emissions by 2050. For Sanders, 

passing legislation like the Green 

New 
Deal 
would 
propel our 

nation to “... achieve 100 percent 

sustainable energy for electricity 

and transportation by no later than 

2030 and to fully decarbonize the 

economy by 2050 at the latest.” For 

Biden, his first year of presidency 

will be dedicated toward legislation 

that “1) establishes an enforcement 

mechanism that includes milestone 

targets no later than the end of his 

first term in 2025, 2) makes a historic 

investment in clean energy and 

climate research and innovation, 3) 

incentivizes the rapid deployment of 

clean energy innovations across the 

economy ... ” 

Though these comparisons exist 

between the outlooks of Sanders 

and Biden on the climate crisis, 

many of Sanders’s supporters still 

internalize disappointment in the 

idea that no politician’s outlook on 

one of the gravest issues of modern 

society will ever match the same 

drastic 
intention 
as 
Sanders’s 

outlook. In understanding that our 

greatest hope for a future will not be 

carried out at the level of influence 

executed by the presidency, we 

have to come to terms with the 

fact that Biden’s campaign is the 

next best option for the future. 

Biden will not easily replace the 

promise of Sanders’s climate plans, 

but he demonstrates substantive 

dedication and commitment toward 

the urgency of the climate issue 

among other political figures.

Above all, we have to understand 

that the alternative — four more 

years of permanent environmental 

degradation and disrespect under 

the Trump administration — is 

entirely unacceptable. We cannot 

succumb 
to 
President 
Donald 

Trump’s business-as-usual in spite 

of our reluctance to see completely 

eye to eye with Biden on all accounts. 

As a party, the most important action 

we can take is to unite to solve the 

issues that pose the biggest threat 

to our future. If we come together 

and acknowledge the compromises 

that need to be made for the greater 

good, we will see that we are truly 

more alike than we are unalike in 

our quest for happiness and justice. 

Furthermore, I urge you to support 

Biden in his presidential campaign 

for the promise that he guarantees 

to address the climate crisis. 

We should support Biden for our climate’s future

NETFLIX

FILM REVIEW

Netflix has long been an excellent source 

of 
cheesy 
rom-coms, 
those 
delightful 

90-minute movies that you can watch 

all the way through while half paying 

attention to something else and still feel 

the satisfaction of a feel-good ending and 

a dramatic kiss. With “Love Wedding 

Repeat,” Netflix has delivered another one 

of these movies, perfect for watching late at 

night when you don’t 

want to think much 

about 
what 
you’re 

watching. That said, 

in terms of amusing 

rom-coms, 
“Love 

Wedding Repeat” is 

a bit of a doozy: there 

are 
dramatic 
exes, 

affairs, attempts to 

spike someone’s drink 

with sleeping meds 

and an exploration of 

multiverse theory.

For the most part, “Love Wedding 

Repeat” presents itself as a typical romcom, 

setting up complex interactions between 

characters in the chaos of a wedding 

reception. Jack (Sam Claflin, “Me Before 

You”) has to keep everything together for 

his sister Hayley’s (Eleanor Tomlinson, 

“Poldark”) wedding in Rome, which means 

navigating interactions between guests at 

the “English table:” Jack’s challenging ex 

Amanda (Freida Pinto, “Rise of the Planet 

of the Apes”) and her boyfriend Chaz (Allan 

Mustafa, “People Just Do Nothing”), quirky 

characters Rebecca (Aisling Bea, “Living 

with Yourself”) and Sidney (Tim Key, “This 

Time with Alan Partridge”) and Bryan (Joel 

Fry, “Game of Thrones”), their lovable but 

sometimes unhelpful friend and Hayley’s 

maid of honor (or “man of honor,” as he 

insists). He’s managing all of this while also 

trying to confess his feelings to Dina (Olivia 

Munn, “X-men: Apocalypse”), Hayley’s 

friend that Jack met three years ago and 

failed to make his move with despite her 

clear reciprocity.

But let’s make it more complicated. 

When 
Marc 
(Jack 

Farthing, “Poldark”), 

an old classmate of 

Hayley’s, shows up 

to ruin the wedding, 

Hayley 
convinces 

Jack to spike Marc’s 

drink with sleeping 

medication. This is 

where the multiverse 

theory 
comes 
in: 

A 
group 
of 
kids 

comes to the table 

and 
moves 
around 

the 
seating 
arrangements. 
There 
are 

thousands of ways the eight people at the 

English table can sit, and the film claims 

that these seating arrangements affect 

the story differently. It takes you through 

the worst-case scenario and the best-case 

scenario, with quick glances at some of the 

other possibilities. Which character gets 

the sleeping medicine, it claims, will affect 

whether love will succeed. These chances, 

these decisions, will affect everything that 

happens afterward. “Chance can be a real 

bastard,” says the Oracle (Penny Ryder, 

“Military Wives”), a random omniscient 

narrator, near the beginning of the film.

The truth is that “Love Wedding Repeat” 

should be able to succeed. The actors are 

talented and well-cast; I especially liked 

Sam Claflin’s wide-eyed and adorable Jack. 

Relationships between characters are often 

very sweet, especially that of brother-sister 

duo Jack and Hayley. The wedding itself 

is stunning, preceded with aerial shots of 

Rome and held in a beautiful garden with 

large, colorful flower beds. Much of the 

comedy is found in awkward exchanges, 

usually 
involving 
Rebecca 
accidentally 

insulting someone in a lovely Irish brogue 

or Sidney and his choice to wear a kilt. Both 

characters provide comedic relief through 

their inability to know when to stop talking. 

The film is certainly entertaining, but the 

plot asks the audience to take a lot of leaps 

that get more difficult to accept as the film 

goes on.

The thing that sinks “Love Wedding 

Repeat” isn’t the overwhelming chaos or 

the long and horribly uncomfortable maid 

of honor speech from a man hopped up on 

sleeping medicine. It’s that its creators 

had a chance to make a simple, sweet 

romantic comedy, and instead they chose to 

convolute the plot with something a bit too 

complicated to feel necessary. No typical 

romantic comedy begins with images of 

galaxies and a truncated discussion of 

physics narrated by a character billed as 

“The Oracle,” and maybe there’s a reason 

for that. If you dig deep, you can find a 

pleasant romantic comedy with interesting 

characters and a sweet message, but you 

have to ignore the philosophical queries to 

get there. In truth, “Love Wedding Repeat” 

feels like a metaphor for itself: Every poor 

decision leads to a consequence. Maybe if 

some decisions had been made differently, 

the film could have been able to succeed.

‘Love Wedding Repeat’ is convoluted, incongruent

Daily Arts Writer

BOOK INTERVIEW
Richie Jackson on politics, parenthood and his new memoir

EMILIA FERRANTE

Daily Arts Writer

In his new memoir, Broadway and TV producer 

Richie Jackson is unapologetic and unabashed 

while still maintaining a level of gentleness 

throughout. “Gay Like Me” functions on multiple 

levels — primarily as a sending-off to his college-

bound son, but also as the story of Jackson’s life, a 

love letter to his husband Jordan Roth, a guidebook 

for parents on raising a gay child and a political 

statement about Donald Trump and his America. 

Jackson makes it clear that being gay is an integral 

part of his life and that it intimately shapes him 

and his identity. In my conversation with him at 

his Manhattan office, he made this point early and 

eloquently. “Being gay is the best part about me, 

and it’s the most important part,” he said. About his 

son, he continued, “I want him to start to begin to 

think of the things I need to share with him about 

what it means to be a gay man.” 

The memoir starts with the birth of Jackson’s 

son through a surrogate. In this way, Jackson 

sets up a timeline for his son immediately and 

shows how his parents being gay was instantly 

important to his life, even before the moment 

of his conception. Jackson and his husband, 

Broadway producer Jordan Roth, along with 

Jackson’s ex-husband, Tony award-winning actor 

B.D. Wong, parented the son together. When he 

was 15, he came out to them, an experience that 

Jackson says was the impetus for the book. At that 

moment of coming out, his son said “Being gay is 

not a big deal.” Jackson vividly recalls the phrase 

“My generation doesn’t think it’s a big deal” from 

his son, a pivotal moment that laid bare the chasm 

between Jackson’s experiences as a gay man and 

his son’s.

To put it simply, as Jackson states in his book, 

“To live as fully gay as possible is how I am most 

alive.” After that conversation with his son, he 

realized the difference in the conception of being 

gay between his generation and his son’s. Jackson 

feels like this difference, while natural, means his 

son and others his age have not been fully exposed 

to the vast spectrum of the gay experience. “How 

naive of me...to let myself believe that the colorful 

lighting display illuminating our nation’s first 

house was our real country,” he writes. “We cannot 

rest on the glory of our being legally married.” But 

he also saw his son as unprepared for the world 

he was about to face, leaving the home of his 

gay parents and sphere of guaranteed LGBTQ+ 

acceptance. Granted, he was only going a few 

blocks away to NYU, but 

Jackson felt like the 

book was a necessary 

warning in a world that 

was not as accepting 

as 
our 
generation 

would like to think it is. 

Though he was afraid of 

“passing down trauma,” 

of “clipping your wings 

just as you are about 

to set off,” the memoir 

maintains a hopeful, if 

not urgent, tone. Jackson 

describes the experience through an anecdote: 

“When (my son) was 7 or 8, and we would swim in 

the ocean, we would talk about riptides. I was so 

scared about riptides. I kept telling him, you swim 

parallel to a riptide, you never swim into it. Not so 

with this riptide of hate.” Despite his son’s more 

blasé attitude, Jackson said, “It’s going to be harder 

for my son to come out in 2020, to come out into 

the world as a gay adult, than it was in 1993 when I 

came to New York to be a gay adult.”

That “riptide of hate,” headed by Donald 

Trump, Mike Pence and Mitch McConnell, can 

be combatted — but Jackson thinks it requires 

a kind of politics that has become a taboo word. 

He began to chuckle knowingly when I brought 

up some people’s qualms with identity politics, 

mainly that they ignore a whole person in favor 

of cherry picking an aspect of identity. Jackson 

sees it differently. “Think about it, we all sit in 

our classrooms and learn history. But it’s only cis, 

white, straight men are ever taught they can go 

the distance in whatever way they want,” he said. 

“Women aren’t taught it, people of color aren’t 

taught it, LGBTQ kids aren’t.” For that reason alone, 

he says, identity politics are valid: simply to get 

those marginalized groups into positions of power 

to pave the way for others 

to come behind. Not 

only that, but the unique 

experience of a person 

from 
a 
marginalized 

group is in and of itself 

valuable. 
As 
Jackson 

put it, “When you are 

other, when you are 

different, when you are 

marginalized, you just 

have a different way of 

feeling and looking at the 

world, and you have this 

enormous well of empathy.” 

These statements are thrown into especially 

sharp relief when considering that Donald Trump 

was present at Jackson’s 2012 wedding to his 

now-husband, Jordan Roth. At the time, Trump 

was merely a New York businessman. Despite his 

repudiation for Trump’s policies, Jackson said his 

wedding “was the most beautiful day, so it’s very 

hard for me to want to change anything about it, 

because it was so perfect.” That, combined with 

the fact that it was a “very large wedding,” makes 

Trump’s presence more of a supporting detail 

rather than an earth-shattering event for Jackson. 

From systemic political change to systemic 

social change, Jackson sees so many places we can 

improve while still acknowledging how far we have 

come in terms of gay representation. First, he brings 

attention to the fact that the closet is still a painful 

reality for many gay people. To put it bluntly, as 

Jackson did in our interview, “the other thing we 

have to remember, and I think young people who 

come out so young might not appreciate so much, is 

that the closet is not a Four Seasons. It’s not a resort, 

it’s a prison.” This came up when I mentioned the 

Generation Z distaste for Pete Buttigieg, which 

Jackson took as an opportunity to highlight this. 

“Could he be fired in 28 states for being gay? Yes, he 

can. Would our adversaries think he’s gay enough 

to discriminate against? Yes, he’s gay enough to be 

discriminated against in all the ways that we are,” 

he said. “A gay person who lives in the closet for 31 

years because of self-loathing, because of fear that 

the life they want for themselves is not possible, is 

as legitimate of a gay experience as these children 

that are coming out so young.”

Yes, it is true that there is much more gay 

representation in the media than there was when 

Jackson himself came out, but the book calls this 

a “false salve.” Because “the entire scaffolding of 

America is constructed for straight people,” the 

reality is that “the miracle of vulnerability hasn’t 

made us whole,” Jackson wrote. Representation 

is nice, he said in the interview, but it “hasn’t 

made us whole, it hasn’t made us safe.” Because of 

this heterosexual scaffolding around which our 

country is built, “Gay people have had to highlight 

our similarities with straight people in order to get 

what we want politically,” Jackson wrote.

Throughout 
my 
self-isolation 

during the COVID-19 pandemic, 

I’ve had a limitless amount of time 

to read books, do schoolwork and 

finish household chores. However, 

instead of doing literally any of those 

activities, I’ve mainly just lounged 

around and taken this newfound time 

to myself to sample different kinds 

of local, domestic and international 

beers. Luckily my adventures in 

brew tasting have run in tandem 

with the series premiere of “Brews 

Brothers” on Netflix. My scraggly, 

quarantine-induced whiskers were 

feeling just a tad more fashionable as 

this new comedy series dives into the 

misadventures surrounding two anal 

retentive brewmaster siblings.

Wilhelm 
Rodman 
(Alan 

Aisenberg, “Orange is The New 

Black”) is the owner and founder of 

Rodman’s Brewing Company in Van 

Nuys, Los Angeles. He has a passion 

for brewing despite the fact that his 

business is slowly tanking. In order 

to keep his brewery alive, he needs 

to win over the satisfaction of a local 

keg distributor. Much to his surprise, 

Wilhelm finds his adopted brother 

Adam “Oxy” Rodman (Mike Castle, 

“Clipped”) at his doorstep offering 

to help save the brewery. We quickly 

learn of the brother’s long history 

of dispute when Wilhelm punches 

Adam right in the face as soon as he 

sees him. Wilhelm explains to his 

employees that he and his brother 

had a falling out years ago when 

he intentionally sabotaged Adam’s 

brew during a competition in order 

to win. “Oxy is short for oxidation,” 

he explains to his crew. “Oxidation 

destroys beer … and Adam destroys 

everything.”

Wilhelm allows his brother to join 

the team, though begrudgingly, given 

the fact that Adam is an unhealthy 

craft beer fanatic to the point of 

banning customers for wanting to 

order “something like a Bud Light.” 

He reveals to his brother that he 

traveled to Los Angeles after being 

exiled from Portland following a 

public rant during a beer expo about 

the overrated nature of IPAs. There’s 

a brief cutaway gag to a scene of Adam 

screaming “IPAs are what people 

drink when they’re all out of good 

ideas!” after having laced the expo 

goers’ drinks with hallucinogenic 

hops. 

The gags in “Brews Brothers” come 

often, and with mixed effectiveness. 

Some land very well with the stooge-

like nature of Wilhelm’s brewery 

handyman Chuy (Marques Ray, “Our 

Footloose Remake”), who is confused 

when he discovers that different 

ways of making beer exist. Other 

characters like Adam come across 

as comedically valuable, but their 

actual purpose in helping to save the 

brewery remains unclear. At times, it 

seems like Adam is actively seeking 

to put his brother out of business 

through his petty alehouse antics. 

At the end of the first episode, as the 

alcohol distributor becomes ecstatic 

at the taste of one of the Rodman’s 

newest craft brews, Adam reveals 

that he purposefully urinated in the 

drink to get back at Wilhelm. When 

the distributor asks for 20 kegs of the 

same beer, Wilhelm and Adam are 

left at a crossroads, confused as to 

how they will possibly replicate the 

taste given that it’s a) human piss and 

b) their only hope.

“Brews 
Brothers” 
is 
a 
web 

series meant for a small audience 

of millennials who probably enjoy 

making 
their 
own 
microbrews 

at home. The series comes from 

the minds of very capable and 

experienced comedic writers such as 

producer Jeff Schaffer, creator of the 

“Seinfeld” Festivus pole. While some 

of the comedy can be quite cringey or 

even outright disgusting, it’s fun to 

see how Netflix producers venture 

into new storylines that border on 

both the niche and the absurd.

TV REVIEW

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
On music during quarantine

KATIE BEEKMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Three weeks ago, the Internet 

collectively rejected a pitchy celebrity 

cover of John Lennon’s “Imagine.” 

Spearheaded by actor Gal Gadot, the 

star-studded clip was meant to uplift 

fans and promote unity. Instead, it did 

the opposite. With many Americans 

losing their jobs and loved ones, the last 

thing people want is millionaires’ pity. 

The question for entertainers, then, is 

what would actually be helpful? Artists 

at all levels of the music industry have 

responded with different approaches.

In lieu of the press and performances 

that make up a typical album release 

cycle, many artists (including The 

1975, Willie Nelson and HAIM) 

have delayed releasing new music 

altogether. Sam Smith not only pushed 

back their album’s release date, but 

also decided to change its title, as it 

was originally titled To Die For. Lady 

Gaga’s highly anticipated comeback 

has been postponed as well. In an 

announcement to fans, she explained 

that Chromatica, which was expected 

on April 10, was supposed to be 

launched alongside a secret Coachella 

set.

Artists’ hesitation about releasing 

new music in a time of crisis is 

understandable. 
I’m 
reminded 
of 

Kesha’s 2012 single “Die Young” which 

swiftly exited US radio playlists in 

the wake of the Sandy Hook school 

shooting. In a similar vein, hyperboles 

like Smith claiming their album is “to 

die for” would certainly be interpreted 

differently in the middle of a pandemic. 

These delays in new music amid 

COVID-19 shed an interesting spotlight 

on the importance of spectacle in the 

music industry. In her announcement, 

Lady Gaga acknowledges music’s 

healing power, but remains unwilling 

to contribute to that process by making 

Chromatica available. I don’t intend to 

diminish the fundraising Lady Gaga 

has engaged with in the meantime, but 

the strategy involved in her decision-

making is obvious. Moments like 

the now-canceled Coachella set are 

meant to bolster a curated image, an 

image used to perpetuate more sales 

and streams. This equation is just as 

important as the music itself. Of course, 

Lady 
Gaga’s 
image-building 
has 

always been intrinsic to her artistry. It 

wouldn’t be a Lady Gaga album launch 

without a few outrageous outfits, 

evocative performances and a smart 

business strategy.

Still, many artists have proceeded 

by releasing music as scheduled. For 

example, Selena Gomez dropped a 

deluxe edition of her latest record 

Rare on April 9, but not without an 

explanation. In an Instagram post 

she reassured fans that, despite 

the cheekiness of her new single 

“Boyfriend,” 
having 
a 
boyfriend 

“is nowhere near the top of (her) 

priorities.” 

For 
the 
most 
part 
though, 

quarantine has actually meant giving 

fans access to more music than usual. 

Dolly Parton’s actions represent the 

less tech-savvy approach to providing 

extra access. On April 10, she added 

six of her previously inaccessible 

albums to all streaming services. 

Garth Brooks, notorious for keeping 

all of his music offline, has opened 

up his catalogue by hosting the TV 

special “Garth and Trisha Live” with 

wife and fellow country singer Trisha 

Yearwood. Countless other musicians 

of all genres and degrees of popularity 

have made their music more available 

in a less conventional way: livestream 

concerts.

In addition to putting their concerts 

online, many singers have taken the 

opportunity to put more of themselves 

online too. Lately, my Instagram feed 

has been full of Q&As, screenshots 

of Zoom songwriting sessions and 

sneak peeks into the production 

process. One trend is to participate 

in 
the 
#unreleasedchallenge 
or 

#demochallenge. 
These 
call 
for 
a 
snippet 

of an unreleased demo, along with its 

backstory, to be posted on social media.

I 
was 
really 
hoping 
that 

writing, and creative projects in 

general, would come easily as my 

self-imposed hermiting became 

mandated. As it turns out, you can’t 

force anything under conditions 

like this, but I’ve been privileged 

enough to use this time as an 

opportunity to reframe how I think 

about productivity. Over the course 

of my high school and college 

years, I’ve become the reigning 

king of the last minute essay, 

the late assignment, the barely 

pinching things together through a 

frenetic stream of unconscionably 

disorganized, strung-out bursts 

and looseleaf papers. The crux of it 

all hinged on feelings of self-blame 

that 
perpetuated 
themselves, 

resulting in seemingly endless self-

handicapping and self-fulfilling 

prophecies. I would take time for 

myself, but it was rarely, if ever, 

directed toward something that I 

actually wanted to get out of that 

time. It would take the shape of 

mindlessly consuming content, 

playing a game with myself about 

how I could start what I needed 

to be doing in 5 minutes, OK 15 

minutes, OK maybe I’ll try to 

go to sleep and do it early in the 

morning. 10 a.m. comes and goes. 

For me, creative work rarely leaves 

the idea stage, but I feel like I’ve 

been given a rare opportunity to 

break that pattern. One of the silver 

linings of watching the world fall 

apart in isolation is that the notion 

of guilt that comes along with the 

rigor of a structured schedule just 

evaporates. By being a little bit 

more deliberate about how I use 

my time and doing my best to fall 

backwards into the ever present pit 

of self-judgment, those same ideas 

are swimming about and they’re 

ready to cross over to dry land.

The last time I felt anything 

akin to this, I was living at home 

and commuting to Washtenaw 

Community College. I had decided 

that my initial choice of 4-year 

institution, 
Columbia 
College 

Chicago, wasn’t the right fit for 

what I wanted out of my higher 

education. I moved back into 

my parents’ house in Northville, 

Mich., began working at the salon I 

went to in high school, and did my 

best to reconnect with old friends 

that were going to Wayne State at 

the time, but this year-and-a-half 

long period felt a lot like limbo. 

This isn’t a treatise on the pain of 

loneliness or feelings of general 

decay, in fact I feel grateful for 

figuring out how to be on my own. 

What struck me as curious about 

this little situational parallel that 

I’ve drawn is that both times I’ve 

found myself deep in a wonderland 

fantasy 
spiral 
of 
complete 

fragrance obsession.

There’s 
a 
deeply 
personal 

element of smell that lends itself to 

escapism. It’s inherently attached 

to memory and to visual ideas that 

can only really be accessed through 

the mind. All sensory experiences 

are personal, but scent seems to 

tie everything together in a way 

that nothing else can. I embarked 

on my descent into the crevasse 

not entirely by choice; a google ad 

for D&G Dolce and Gabbana #3 

(L’imperatrice) popped up during 

one of my aimless internet romps, 

and it reminded me of when I had 

a bottle of it in middle school. My 

parents took my sister and I to 

Las Vegas for spring break when 

I was 13 and, unbeknownst to me 

then, it was one of the first times 

I let myself explore something 

that wasn’t expressly intended 

for men. It smelled like kiwi 

and watermelon, which for the 

fragrance world is a weird combo. 

It would be classified somewhere 

in the unisex, fruity Gourmand 

category, which denotes fragrances 

that smell like things you can eat. 

Generally not something I would 

look for in a fluid that’s meant to 

be sprayed on my body — the idea 

of smelling like a kiwi does not 

exactly spark a sense of allure. But 

I loved it, and every time I used 

it, it made me smile. I remember 

putting on my neon yellow and 

blue plaid Abercrombie & Fitch 

shirt and my Versace wraparound 

sunglasses (YIKES), spraying on 

my D&G #3 and feeling like I was 

on top of the world.

That’s the magic of fragrance, 

for me. I love that a particular 

smell, or the mere visual reminder 

of one, can immediately take 

you back to a different place in 

time, or even unlock parts of your 

imagination that aren’t necessarily 

tied to any one part of your personal 

history. They’re sentimental and 

imaginative, and while sensuality 

and sexuality are well-ingrained in 

the experience of smell, they’re so 

much more than that. A great scent 

is no less than any other work of 

art, often incorporating hundreds 

of natural and synthetic materials, 

pairing 
them 
in 
carefully 

calculated concentrations with 

one another according to their 

molecular weight and vibration, in 

order to create a deeply intimate, 

conceptual experience from the top 

note to the drydown. I’ve decided 

to devote a lot of my time during 

these next few weeks (potentially 

months) to sharing my experiences 

and ideas about fragrance publicly, 

through 
writing, 
styling 
and 

creating a Youtube channel (also 

a potential yikes) to share the joy 

that I’ve found with others.

Without further ado, below are 

descriptions of a few scents I’ve 

worn over the years and some 

of the experiences I’ve had with 

them. If you’re new to the world 

of fragrance and want to give it a 

try, I highly recommend reading 

reviews and descriptions online, 

as well as looking into different 

types of scents and the effects that 

they’re supposed to have. Biologist 

and perfume critic Luca Turin 

has also published some highly 

informative 
and 
surprisingly 

funny books on the subject.
