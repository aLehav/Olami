University has
pledged $300,000
for renovations while
new location sought
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
After years of requests to the
University and a demand from
the Black Student Union on Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. Day, the Trot-
ter Multicultural Center will soon
receive $300,000 from the Uni-
versity for renovations and a new
center will be built in the future.
Now, it just needs to be planned
it out.
To that end, students converged
at the current Trotter Center
Thursday night to discuss plans
for the new building and create
teams to contribute to the plan-
ning process moving forward.
The Trotter Center, named
after William Monroe Trotter,
an early civil rights activist, first
opened its doors in 197L The orig-
inal center was built as a result of
a movement in which Black fac-
ulty, staff and students protested
for Black students to havea space

of their own.
However, the original struc-
ture burned down in 1972 and the
center was subsequently relocat-
ed to its current location, a former
fraternity house on Washtenaw
Avenue.
The New Trotter is a student
lead initiative working along side
the Black Student Union to make
good on the seventh BSU demand,
asking for a new student space for
the Trotter Center.
The three primary goals of the
New Trotter is to prioritize reno-
vations for the current building,
find a location closer to campus
for a new building in the next
three to five years, and to find bet-
ter funding for the center, Public
Policy senior Fernando Coello
said.
A team of administrators met
with the New Trotter group and
will continue to in the next com-
ing weeks.
At the meeting, students
formed groups and talked about
what Trotter means to them and
why the Multicultural Center is a
critical part of the University.
Over 40 students brainstormed
ideas for the new center at the
end of the meeting. Among other

UMHS doctors
perform historic
procedure with
heart graft
By AMABEL KAROUB
Daily StaffReporter
With Valentine's Day around
the corner, doctors at the Uni-
versity of Michigan Health Sys-
tem are looking to mend some
broken hearts.
UMHS surgeons made his-

tory on Jan. 21 by performing a
new surgery to repair thoracic
aortic aneurysms, the cause of
approximately 10,000 deaths
in the United States each year
according to the Centers for
Disease Control. The procedure
performed at the University
Hospital involved the first-ever
implantation of a new type of
heart graft, the Gore TAG Tho-
racic Branch Endoprosthesis.
Cardiac Surgery Prof. Himan-
shu Patel, Radiology Prof. David
Williams and Surgery Prof.
Jon Eliason performed the first
two surgeries with the newly

approved device. The Gore TAG
is unique in its ability to reach
a portion of the heart that has
generally been difficult to treat.
Heart grafts are a commonly
used treatment for heart aneu-
rysms, which occur when there
is a weak spot in a blood ves-
sel. The pressure from blood on
such weak spots can cause them
to bulge, which can eventually
result in the vessel rupturing.
The aorta is the largest blood
vessel in the body, so it is par-
ticularly dangerous for an aneu-
rysm to occur in that area near
the heart. An aortic rupture

can result in massive internal
bleeding, which is fatal without
immediate treatment.
The aorta runs from the
heart through the chest before
descending to the abdomen. A
thoracic aortic aneurysm is an
aneurysm that affects the aorta
in the thoracic, or chest, area.
Patel said aneurysms near the
arch of the aorta are much more
difficult to treat than those near
the abdomen or other areas.
"Aneurysms that encroach
within the arch vessels are a lit-
tle harder to treat because of the

Slurping Turtle will
serve up ramen and
Japanese cuisine
By CHRISTY SONG
DailyStaffReporter
Foodies rejoice: Slurping
Turtle, a new Japanese restau-
rant, expected to open in the
spring near campus.
Takashi Yagihashi, a nation-
ally renowned chef, will open
the noodle restaurant in the
former Borders building on
East Liberty and Maynard
Streets.
The menu will include hot
and cold appetizers like sashi-
mi, maki rolls and duck fat
fried chicken, assorted types
of ramen, bento boxes and rice
bowls.
Prices for ramen will range
from $13 to $14 and bento boxes
- which contain a variation of
different foods - cost about
$18.
Yagihashi, who was a
guest contestant on Iron Chef
America, runs two restau-
rants, Takashi and the original
Slurping Turtle, both in Chi-
cago. Through Slurping Turtle,
Takashi hopes to recreate some
of his favorite Japanese comfort
foods and bring the same expe-
rience to the guests, according
to the restaurant's website.
Slurping Turtle will open

alongside Knight's Steakhouse,
Huntington National Bank and
Sweetwater's Coffee & Tea,
subdividing the previous Bor-
ders building into four separate
venues. Knight's Steakhouse
will tentatively open in March
and Huntington National Bank
is already open.
Tomukun Noodle Bar, a sim-
ilar restaurant, is also located
on East Liberty Street, just
down the block from Slurping
Turtle. As both restaurants
feature variations on ramen,
the two will likely compete for
business.
Tomukun's prices will be
lower than Slurping Turtle by
a few dollars on average. Addi-
tionally, Tomukun's menu adds
a Korean fusion to the recipes
while Slurping Turtle is more
heavily influenced by Japanese
flavors.
Some students are skepti-
cal about Slurping Turtle's
chances of success, as its main
customers will be students on
a budget and many are already
comfortable with Tomukun.
While some students are
skeptical of the how success-
ful Slurping Turtle will be due
to its high prices, others said
they are willing to try the new
eatery.

Before hitting familiar stores
at Briarwood Mall, shoppers will
likely need to check a map.
Briarwood Mall announced
plans last week to relocate sev-
eral stores after completing an
extensive renovation in Novem-
ber. During the upcoming transi-
tion, Forever 21, a clothing store,
will expand into a new location
and five other stores will move to
new spaces within the mall.
The expanded Forever 21 will
reopen at the end of 2014 in the
JCPenny wing of the mall, but
the existing store will remain
open during the transition.
"It is a fantastic opportunity
for Forever 21 to expand its size
and offer more selections for
its customers, like University of
Michigan students," said Hollon
Kohtz, a public relations rep-
resentative for the mall, in an
e-mail interview.
In a press release, Denise
Murray, Briarwood's director of
marketing and business develop-
ment, said she is excited about
the progress.

New five-year
authorization
will extend food
assistance programs
DETROIT (AP) - A group of
scientists at Michigan State Uni-
versity huddled around a com-
puter screen earlier this week
- not poring over scientific data
but watching a webcast of the
U.S. Senate.
Among them was Rufus Isaa-
cs, an entomologist who leads
a team of U.S. and Canadian
scientists working to enhance
bee pollination of crops. Isaacs
was anxious to see if the Senate
would approve the long-delayed
farmbill, andwith itcontinue the
$8.6 million federal grantcritical
to his pollen project's survival.
The Senate passed the legislation
and Congress sent it to President
Barack Obama, who is expected
to sign the bill Friday on Isaacs'
campus in East Lansing.
"It was a great relief and cel-
ebration in my lab," Isaacs said
of the rare moment when pollen
took a backseat to politics. "It's
been a long wait for this."
The nearly $100 billion-a-year
federal farm bill, passed after 2
% years of legislative wrangling,
does two main things: Almost
80 percent of the money goes to
food stamps for the needy, and
around 15 percent is designat-
ed for farm subsidies and crop
insurance subsidies. The pledge
of hundreds of millions of dol-
lars for agricultural research is

a relative drop in the bucket, but
it's pumping money into univer-
sities across the country, partic-
ularly for advanced agricultural
research.
Obama's visit to Michigan
State is a nod to the primary
role a fellow Democrat, Michi-
gan U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow,
chairwoman of the Senate's
Agriculture Committee, played
in authoring the bill and getting
it passed.
But Tom Coon, director of the
university's extension program,
also said the signing is appropri-
ate in a state where agriculture
is the second-largest industry,
behind only manufacturing, and
at a school founded in 1855 as the
Agricultural College of the State
of Michigan.
It's not clear exactly how
much is going to universities,
since much of the five-year farm
bill's budget represents money
authorized to be spent but not
yet appropriated in the annual
budgeting process. And other
funding will come in the form of
competitive grants that must be
matched by the private sector.
Still, experts say, it appears
to represent an overall increase
to public research schools. All
of the research funding from
the last farm bill continues and
grows in some areas, such as spe-
cialty crop research, including
work on citrus diseases.
Another addition is $200 mil-
lion to create the Foundation for
Food Agriculture Research. The
money for the nonprofit orga-
nization is guaranteed but also
has to be matched through pri-

vate investment. The aim of the
foundation is to boost coopera-
tion between industry, academia
and private foundations, and
research will focus on safe, effi-
cient and sustainable food pro-
duction, innovations to boostthe
economy and fightglobalhunger.
Ian Maw, vice president for
food, agriculture and natural
resources with the Washington,
D.C.-based Association of Pub-
lic and Land-Grant Universities,
said mostofhis advocacyorgani-
zation's priorities were incorpo-
rated into the bill.
"Bottom line, I think it's a
good bill and we're glad it's final-
ly done," Maw said. "It was a long
and torturous trip to come to this
point."
The bill's mere passage might
be the best news of all to the
university researchers, many of
whom found themselves inlimbo
as the legislation foundered. For
instance, the pollen project led
by Michigan State's Isaacs lost
its funding when the farm bill
passed in 2007 expired at the end
of 2012.
Congress voted to extend the
bill for one year in January 2013,
but new projects in the original
bill with mandatory funding
weren't authorized, and "if it's
not authorized, Congress can't
spend the money," said Coon, the
extension program director.
Coon said several university
departments "patched together"
money to maintain the work of
Isaac's team, which is studying
what growers can do about pol-
linating crops in the wake of col-
lapsingbee colonies.

A view from the heart

V IRGINIA LOZANO/DUaily
Dr. Himanshu J. Patel performs a new surgery to help repair thoracic aortic
aneurysms at the Cardiovascular Center of the University Hospital Wednes-
day.

curvature of the aorta," Patel said.
"They come close to important
blood vessels that supply impor-
tant parts."
To treat aneurysms, surgeons
place stent grafts in the diseased
area of the blood vessel. Stent
grafts are small tubes supported
by a metal mesh framework. The
graft redirects blood flow so that
it can pass the aneurysm without
causing further injury to the area.
Relieving the pressure on the ves-
sel walls lessens the risk of rup-
ture.
While stent grafts were used
to treat aneurysms before the
invention of the Gore TAG, Patel
said former grafts were designed
to treat straight sections of the
aorta. Treating aneurysms in
the aortic arch with these grafts
required a complicated supple-
mental procedure.

"Usually when it encroaches
on the left arm blood vessel,
we made a cut in the neck, we
did a bypass from the left brain
blood vessel to the left arm
blood vessel ... and then put
the stent graft across that area
where the left arm blood vessel
comes off," Patel said.
Unlike former stent grafts,
the Gore TAG has a branch
that allows it to fit better into
the aorta's arch. Patel said this
device was designed and man-
ufactured specifically for this
procedure. It allows for a much
less invasive surgery than was
previously possible, requiring
only a small groin incision.
Although the Gore TAG stent
graft is a step forward, it only has
one branch. In contrast, the aorta
branches into three different
blood vessels. Patel said he hopes
that there will soon be multiple
branch stent grafts to better fit
the shape of the aorta.
"The hope is that we're going to

a multiple branch system to treat
more of the arched aorta," Patel
said.
UMHS is one of only six hospi-
tals in the country with access to
the Gore TAG. The others are Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, the Mayo
Clinic, Dartmouth College, The
University of Pennsylvania and
Stanford University. The Gore
TAG is also undergoing a feasibil-

ity study through the FDA. Patel
said the device has been success-
fully implanted in animals and
was determined ready for human
use.
"What the FDA allows is a
small number of patients to be
enrolled in the study, to see how
this device interacts with human
beings," Patel said. "If it looks
like it works pretty well, then

what they'll do is they'll allow for
a bigger trial, to see if it can be
approved for use in the U.S."
Patel said UMHS was the first
hospital to perform the surgery
because they had the first will-
ing patients. The surgery was a
success on both of the first two
patients, who were discharged
from the hospital within a week
of having the surgery. Now that

UMHS has shown that the Gore
TAG works, it is likely that it will
be approved for wider use.
"They were very brave people,"
Patel said. "Because they were
brave enough to participate in
this trial, we hope that this type
of device will succeed and be
available to other patients so that
we can treat them perhaps in a
better way."

Friday, The Wafel Shop is giving
away free waffles - you buy the
toppings - to celebrate its one
year anniversary, from 12 p.m. to
2 p.m. What better way to recov-

ticket price.
"Dench seems to go in a softer
direction with 'Philomena,' but
Phil is possibly her most badass
character yet: a forgiving woman

doesn't pretend to be someone she
is not," Gadbois wrote.
STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Bridging a lack of access
The NITC is a necessary investment for Michigan's future
ecently, the Canadian government announced its willingness to
begin construction on the New International Trade Crossing to
Canada, which voters approved in 2012. The NITC is a necessary
alternative to the privately owned Ambassador Bridge. Furthermore, the
NITC has the potential to contribute to economic growth - which Detroit
seriously needs. The bridge would create job opportunities, as well as lead to
needed infrastructure improvements for shipping industrial components in
and out of a city that is still heavily dependent on manufacturing. Republican
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder must work with the federal government to
provide the necessary funding and ensure the bridge's construction.

Yeah, we know.

The Canadian government is ready to
proceed with land purchases, and will be
responsible for the majority of the costs -
totaling over $2 billion. The United States has
yet to provide the $325 million needed to build
a customs plaza and 1-75 connection ramps.
Although Snyder has strongly endorsed the
new bridge, his push has not been sufficient to
pressure the Department of Homeland Security
to provide the funds.
The Ambassador Bridge, which was built in
1929, lacks the capacity to meet the demand
for trade and ground shipping exchanges
between Detroit and Windsor. According to a
2010 report, approximately 10,000 commercial
vehicles cross over the four-lane bridge on
a typical weekday. Canadian transportation
officials are expecting truck traffic to triple and
vehicle traffic to double over the next 30 years.
The Ambassador Bridge already struggles to
accommodate truck and vehicle traffic, and
increases will unnecessarilyburden businesses
with long border wait times. Because the
current bridge directs traffic through
residential and commercial areas, trucks pass
through 17 traffic lights in town. Although
there is a Detroit-Windsor tunnel as well,
public demand for the NITC demonstrates the
incapacity of the existing bridge and tunnel.
The NITC will directly connect to major roads,
simultaneously increasing efficiency and
alleviating traffic. The NITC has the potential
to enhance the already strong trade relationship
between the two countries, improving the
economies of both throughthe additional gains
of comparative advantage.
Furthermore, the NITC would provide a
public option for internationalcrossingbetween
Detroit and Windsor, disrupting the private
near-monopoly held by the Moroun family,
the current owners of the Ambassador Bridge.
The new bridge is needed to strike a balance
between private and public ownerships. This

would allow tolls to respond better to market
pressure.TheCanadiangovernmentwillcollect
tolls to help offset the costs of construction, but
ownership of the bridge will be jointly held
between the United States and Canada.
The NITC may also help spur job growth
in Detroit. Snyder believes that this major
construction project will directlycreate 12,000
jobs and indirectly create 31,000 jobs as a
byproduct ofbetter trade.Also,more trucks can
smoothly cross over the new bridge for trading
business purposes. In an interview with CBC
News, Snyder said, "Getting Michigan-made
products to more markets faster will enhance
our economic competitiveness in the future
and help our state create more jobs." Once
construction is complete, the bridge may help
revitalize the city of Detroit and attract new
industry and business professionals.
While his support for the project is
commendable, Snyder needs to do more
to ensure the project moves forward in a
timely manner. Snyder should pressure the
Department of Homeland Security to fund
the plaza. As the Canadian government has
already committed to fund the project up front,
the United States should actively cooperate
with Canada so that construction can begin.
Snyder also needs to create a plan to relocate
or properly compensate the more than 1,000
residents who will have to move out of the
Delray district to make room for the plaza and
related infrastructure. Concrete plans from
Snyder could help further construction efforts
that will benefit the state.
Prompt action by Snyder and the federal
government to provide funds for the NITC
is in the best interest of the state. Adequate
funding for the customs plaza will allow
construction to begin on a project that will
enhance trade, create jobs and provide a
balance between government and private
ownership of vital infrastructure.

first heard news of Brendan
Gibbons's expulsion from the
University
via the benevo-
lent, ever-present
Facebook. The
Michigan Daily
article outlining
his expulsion -
er, "permanent
separation" - K
from the Univer-
sity was trending STEEN
on my newsfeed.
Rather than a
collective gasp or indication of any
form of surprise really, the general
reaction from the people posting the
article seemed to be a response of, "It
was about time!"
Brendan Gibbons? Rape
allegations?
"Yeah, we know."
We didn't always know, though.
In fact, the allegations of rape
against Gibbons go back all the way
to 2009, but I didn't even hear about
the case until around August last
summer - also from a post I saw
on Facebook. I remember wonder-
ing why The Daily, in the four years
since the incident, hadn't covered
the allegations against Gibbons ... at
all ... and I felt simultaneously hesi-
tant and motivated to write about
the topic given that 'the case had
-been essentially off the radar for so
long. Could I be sued if I wrote about
Gibbons? I wondered. Is it too far in
the past to bring up now? Is there
any "point" to bringing it up now?
There's a kind of learned helpless-
ness that seems to have developed in
regard to the Gibbons case - a feeling
of, yeah, we all sort of knew about it
by now, but we had accepted that the
University, the coaches, the police
and the student body weren't going
to do anything about it. We felt pow-
erless, hopeless and, perhaps even-
tually indifferent. And this shared
sense of helplessness is particularly
unnerving given that it's such a high-
profile case. Sexual assault survivors
all too often do not get the benefit of

the doubt, which explains why 97
percent of rapists receive virtually
no punishment. We knew about this
case - we knew about Gibbons - and
yet it felt like there was nothing we
could aboutit.
I ended up writing a column about
Gibbons and football and its relation
to rape culture in general. I received
several emails after writing my col-
umn from readers expressing their
shared disgust with the issue. "Not
proud," "conflicted" and "disturbed"
were a few responses to my column
in regards to Gibbons and the overall
lack of coverage on the case.
And my response to these e-mails
was essentially, "Yeah, I know." (And,
of course, "Thanks for writing.")
And all the while, there was a
sense that it was all over anyway
- that there was nothing we could
do about it now. It was too late. The
Daily even wrote in one article out-
lining the case,
"It's unclear why
sanctions were Like the.

this matter until the Uni
recently."
So why did it response to

ball player? The
Michigan Daily
ended its article on Gibbons's expul-
sion with, "Gibbons is fourth in made
field goals in Michigan history and
owns the program record for con-
secutive successful extra points with
141." Odd way to end an article about
an alleged rapist. Even stranger, the
Athletic Department spokesman,
Dave Ablauf, doesn't want to say
when Gibbons came to speak to the
Athletic Department regarding his
expulsion over sexual assault allega-
tions. And when Michigan football
coach Brady Hoke gave a press con-
ference that included comment on
the Gibbons allegations this Mon-
day, guess who wasn't invited? The

no-good meddlin' news staff of The
Michigan Daily.
But, much like I felt when I wrote
my column on Gibbons originally -
and howI feel when I write many of
my columns - I often ask myself, Is
anyone even listening?
I'm thinking back to Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. Day, when I
stopped by the protest formed by
students of the Black Student Union
outside Hill Auditorium. The BSU
students formed a line and listed
seven demands they insisted the
University acknowledge and follow
through on.
What stood out to me most dur-
ing this protest, though, was the line
uttered by Business senior Shayla
Scales: "We have heard the Univer-
sity use the phrase 'We are listening'
since 1970, and I am tired of waiting
for a response. We are tired of wait-
ing for a response."
I think the

The Student
Union of Michi-

mishandling of the Gibbons case, as
well as other unimpressive responses
from the University regarding sexual

and employee salaries, to name a few.
The University does respond when
its students complain, but, just like
the belated expulsion of Gibbons
received a widely-uttered reply of,
"Yeah, we knew that all along" from

LeaVing
shame and
suffring behind

I'msorry for your pain.
That's what someone
told me recently after
hearing a song I wrote for my
upcoming album, and it's not
the first time.
It's not the
first time
that some-
one's rec-
ognized the
unmistaken,
palpableA
agony in my CARLY
voice and lyr- KEYES
ics and then
apologized
for the evident, all-consuming
pain.
I don't share openly about
my trials with mental illness
because I want sympathy. At
one point in my life, sympathy
was like oxygen; I needed it
to survive. But I don't need it
today. I'm not sorry for my pain.
I am sorry that I thought I ever
needed to hide it.
I speak up despite the social
stigma because I'm hoping it
might encourage others to do
the same - to feel comfortable
enough to share their struggles
with mental illness, too. I used
to think that my problems -
alcoholism, depression, perfec-
tionism - were so unique. But I
quickly learned that it's not my
struggles that are unique; it's
my willingness to share about
them.
Every time I watch "Inside
the Actor's Studio" and I hear
James Lipton ask his guests
during the famous exit inter-
view, "What is your least favor-
ite word?" I know my answer:
Shame. It's an ugly word, it's an
awful emotion and it's killing
people left and right by keeping
them from asking for the help
they so desperately need.
in my last column, I focused
on another emotion, fear, and
how letting it run my life will
dampen my dreams and pre-
vent me from living life to the
fullest. But if I let shame fester
and infiltrate my soul, this toxic
emotion will prevent me from
living period. It'll get me alone,
keep me alone and prey on my
self-worth until there's nothing
left.
I'll never know the true
extent of the harm I caused
while in my addiction as I spent
hours upon hours blacked out,
but I do vividly remember plen-
ty of embarrassing, shudder-
worthy incidents, and these
memories constantly tempt me
to spiral into a shame attack: I
drove drunk hundreds of times
- with unsuspecting passen-
gers in my car - and got arrest-
ed twice (the first time I was
in a bathing suit). I spent two
weeks in Oakland County jail.
I woke up next to men whose
names I never learned. I stole
from my loved ones and blamed
it on other people. I lied and lied
and lied and lied ... and while
today the idea of taking my own
life sounds more than foreign, at
one time it wasn't. At one time, I
was in that place.
I remember first hearing
about the concept of suicide as
a young girl, and it confused
me. I didn't understand what
might lead someone to viewing
death as a viable option - until
that someone became me on a
Sunday night in the fall of 2009.

I remember it was a Sunday
because I had been watching an
awards show with my younger
sister earlier that evening. I love
my sister dearly, and some of the
best memories I have are of us
making music together, wheth-
er onstage or in the studio. The
beautiful sound of our voices
blending together is a fitting
metaphor for our relationship -
harmony at its best.
But even though I had the
love of my sister, a devoted fam-
ily and sea of friends in my heart
and an abundance of passion for
athletics, academics and art in
my soul, I also had a physical
ailment in my brain: A vicious
pair of mental health disorders

known as addiction and depres-
sion, and I was drowning in
a well of shame - filled to the
brim and spilling over the edges
- and instead of swimming, I
decided it would be easier just
to sink. Yes, that night I decided
that it would be better to die
than admit that I was an alco-
holic suffering from depres-
sion who couldn't get sober and
stay happy when left to my own
devices, I had too much shame
about my conditions to ask for
help ... even from my own sister.
So, I said good-bye to her for
what I thought would be the last
time, drove to Meijer, bought a
fifth of Jack Daniels and began
to down a bottle of painkillers
I'd saved from when I had my
wisdom teeth removed. I didn't
even think to write a note; I just
wanted it all to be over with.
But for once in my life, Id never
been happier that I'd failed at
something. I woke up the next
morning, and emotionally [had
reached a new level of pain that
I can only appropriately and
entirely express when I have a
guitar in my hands or piano keys
at my fingertips.
I immediately called my fam-
ily, entered a treatment cen-
ter and learned all about my
co-morbid biological diseases
called addiction and depression.
I began to slowly rid myself of
the inappropriate shame I car-
ried as a result of having these
conditions. Some of the best
medical professionals in the
field taught me that it's not my
fault; it's not a chtice I made.
Addiction, depression, any and
every mental health disorder,
is a disease and a physical ill-
ness of the brain that requires
treatment
Just as a broken leg needs
a cast, I have an injured brain
- the body's most essential
organ - but while a broken leg
can fully heal and return to its
normal state, treating a mental
health disorder is not a quick
fix situation, nor is it perma-
nent, but the healing process
starts by removing the shame
factor - realizing that a mental
illness does not make someone
an immoral or a weak or a "less-
than" individual.
About three weeks ago, I
came across a piece of news that
rocked my world: A beautiful,
19-year-old freshman track-star
at the University of Pennsylva-
nia had jumped off of a parking
garage to her death.
My empathy grew when I
read that she had also been a
standout soccer player in high
school, and my heart broke as
I gazed upon a photo of her
dressed head to toe, smiling
ear to ear, in a familiar outfit: A
vibrant, bright red and dark blue
Penn athletics uniform. Though
I wasn't at the point of contem-
plating suicide when I was a D1
student-athlete at Penn, it was
during that time when depres-
sion had settled in and drench-
ing my demons in alcohol was at
an all-time high.
In 2011, the American College
Health Association - National
College Health Assessment
- a nationwide survey of col-
lege students at 2- and 4-year
institutions - found that about
30 percent of college students
reported feeling "so depressed
that it was difficult to function"

at some time in the past year.
More than 6 percent of college
students reported seriously
considering suicide, and about
1 percent reported attempting
suicide in the previous year. Sui-
cide is the third leading cause of
death for teens and young adults
ages 15 to 24.
Then just a little over three
days ago, I got some more world-
rocking news: Philip Seymour
Hoffman had died from a heroin
overdose. I'm a film major; I
write for the Daily's film section
and have always admired Hoff-
man as an incredibly talented
actor, but I failed to realize that
that this unmatched artistic
talent was also just a regular

human - a father of three chil-
dren - who battled a deadly
mental illness everyday of his
life. My empathy peaked when
I came across a 2006 interview
that he gave for "60 Minutes"
where he briefly spoke about his
sobriety. Not only had he gotten
sober, but he had done so at age
22 and had been in recovery for
23 years until he relapsed.
I will certainly remember
Philip Seymour Hoffman as
one of the greatest actors I've
ever witnessed, but I will, too,
remember him as a man who
fought valiantly to treat his ill-
ness ... to the best of his abilities.
This is the especially awful fact
about addiction and mental ill-
ness in general: Not only does
it require treatment, it requires
chronic treatment due to its
chronic nature, and so despite
more than two decades with-
out putting drugs or alcohol
in his system, Hoffman wasn't
cured. It's a sad yet important
reminder for me that despite
three years without alcohol in
my system, I'm certainly not
cured either.
In fact, 40 to 60 percent of
drug addicts in recovery will
eventually relapse, according to
the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, which calls relapse "not
only possible but also likely,"
and users of opioid drugs like
heroin have a much higher
relapse rate than other addicts
- as high as 80 percent or above.
I've learned that
my struggles
aren't unique.
A beautiful, gifted track-star
at an Ivy League school. One of
the greatest actors of all-time.
My roommate from treatment
who put a gun to her head. My
friend who overdosed on heroin.
Another friend who hung her-
self. Another friend who died
from choking on her own vomit
after an alcohol binge - they all
suffered from mental illness,
and I just wish they would have
shared their pain when they
needed to most.
Somewhere along the line we
learned that asking for help is a
sign of weakness and that shar-
ing our feelings is for wimps and
that goingto therapy is for crazy
people. But what's really crazy
is trying to recover from a men-
tal disorder alone and acting
like we're just fine, when we're
really struggling inside and let-
ting the misinformed opinions
of other people cause us to feel
shame and affect our decision to
stay silent about our pain.
Am I sorry about worrying
my friends and family with my
erratic and dangerous behav-
ior? Of course, I am. I'm end-
lessly sorry for what I put my
sister through that night when
I thought that death was not
only an option but the only one,
for the countless lives I endan-
gered while driving drunk, for
the copious wrongs I've done
to others, but I can't change the
past nor should I dwell upon it
too intently. I can only live in the
present and take care of myself
by overcoming the shame that's

been inappropriately attached
to mental health disorders and
sharing my pain by using pro-
ductive coping skills ... like this
column.
So, to anyone and everyone
who struggles with a stigma-
tized mental disorder or has lost
someone you love far too soon to
addiction, suicide from depres-
sion, or from the devastating
consequences of any untreated
mental health disorder, have no
shame, share your pain and you
will always have my deepest
empathy.

Fiona and Cordelia slowed
things down, allowing for sub-
stance and depth to be restored.
Cordelia may have brought to
light one of "Coven"'s most egre-
gious missteps, but by the end
of the episode, Fiona had done
just the opposite. Her demise
was heartbreaking, and the
realization of deep regret over
the failed relationship with her
daughter solidified the true story
behind "Coven" - not one about
witches, but one about family,
about finding your pack.
A truly

As "Coven" came to a close,
there was a refreshing open-end-
edness not seen before in "Amer-
ican Horror Story" - the only of
the three iterations that could
have organically continued into
a second season. Perhaps that's
what Ryan Murphy meant when
he described "Coven" as lighter
than its predecessors. In the
final minutes, Cordelia's Acad-
emy is whole again, marked by a
resilience, strength and excite-
ment not best represented by
"The Seven Wonders," but repre-
sentative of yet another success-
ful, psychotic year of "American
Horror Story."

THE BOARD FOR STUDENT PUBLICATIONS
SEEKS NEW MEMBERS
The University of Michigan Board for Student Publications is
recruiting new members for three year terms beginning in April.
The Board is responsible for three publications:
The Michigan Daily, the Michiganensian yearbook, and the Gargoyle.
Because the Board is committed to realizing diversity's benefits for itself and
for the publications it oversees, the Board is particularly interested in recruiting
members of the University community (faculty, staff and students), or the
general public who are members of underrepresented groups and who
have experience and expertise in journalism, law, finance, or fundraising.
All interested persons are encouraged!to apply.

unsure if many students would go
to Slurping Turtle if it is higher
priced than competitors.
"Honestly, I don't really know
because I have to see what the
Slurping Turtle is like so it
depends but I guess there might
be some competition if there are
two ramen shops," Chang said.

LSA senior Jenny Kim said
she was unsure about the new
restaurant's future success, cit-
ing higher prices as a factor that
might make it more difficult for
the restaurant to become estab-
lished in the Asian fusion mar-
ket.
"Seating and waiting is a big
thing so maybe if it's a little
more spacious then people will
want to go there," Kim said. "I
think that everyone wants to try

new things soI think it would be
good."
Other students think the loca-
tion of Slurping Turtle might
also be problematic for its long-
term prospects.
LSA senior Lauren Himmel
said she thinks the fate of Slurp-
ing Turtle could be similar to
that of Firehouse Subs, which
was located close to many simi-
lar restaurants. Firehouse Subs
closed earlier this year after 10

months in business.
"I think that it would do bet-
ter if it were to be located on
South (University) and so stu-
dents who are looking for the
same kind of feel or want the
same kind of type of food would
be able to access it from that
kind of area instead of having
to walk all the way across cam-

out and create economic power
in the community was suggested.
A kitchen, a resource center with
computers, printers and a place
to study, creative places to paint
or write, safe, private spaces to
talk and places for guests, speak-
ers or other students, were all
brought up as well.
The Trotter House was
renamed the Trotter Multicul-
tural Center in 1981 to be more
inclusive to students from many
backgrounds, instead of only
being a space for Black students.
It later merged with MESA (a
student organization focused on
diversity and social justice) to
serve an even broader campus
audience.
"Moving from a Trotter House
to a Trotter Multicultural Cen-
ter is quite the slap in the face,"
said LSA junior Rolly Abiola, a
student manager at the Trotter
Center and discussion leader at
Thursday night's meeting.
From 1998 to 2004, Abiola
said, the building underwent a
facility enhancement assessment
to see if the building met fire
codes, which it did not. Accord-
ing to Abiola, the building was
structurally unsafe and nothing
was acted upon or even submit-
ted to the University until 2005,
Abiola said.
Only small changes - a new
paint job and a new pillar on the
third floor - were made, Abiola
said.
"I've come here, I've napped
here, I've cried here,"Abiola said.
"I've been frustrated here. I've
been fed here. This is my house.
This is my room. This place has
nurtured me when I didn't think
I deserved to be nurtured."
It took 10 years for changes
to be made to make the building
wheelchair accessible. Today,
only the basement and the first
floor are accessible. According
to Abiola, all other floors are still
inaccessible to the physically
impaired.
"We made it work and we are
still making it work, to be quite

frank, because this building is
still not where it needs to be,"
Abiola said.
Abiola said the University has
neglected the Trotter Center
numerous times in the past. She
cited an incident on Aug. 25th,
2013 when an intoxicated stu-
dent from one of the numerous
fraternity houses located next
to the Trotter Center illegally
entered the center, dragging
blood coming from a wound on
his ankle across the entirety of
the first and second floor.
Abiola said the police declared
the incident an "open and shut
case" once they located the stu-
dent and left. They did not make
sure anyone else was in the
building or if the students were
safe Abiola said.
After the incident, students
and the resident staff had to
scrub the blood off the ground,
she said.
"There was a lack of response
from the University and even
weeks after the incident there
were no crime alerts sent out,"
Abiola said. "We are so disre-
spected on so many levels, on
an institutional level. It needs to
stop."
The Trotter Center used to
host overnight retreats for high
school students. After the inci-
dent in 2013, the center was pro-
hibited from doing so, Rackham
student Angela Abiolasaid.
"Not only is this a space for
us as University students, but it
is also a space that allows us to
introduce our communities to
this campus,"Angela Abiola said.
"And simply the distance from
campus now tells (prospective
students) that we are not valued
in this space."
At the end of the meeting,
studentsevolunteered for differ-
ent teams: the data team, the
research team, the short term
team, the long term team or
members at large.
The short term team will
meet weekly or biweekly with
an administrative team to best
determine how to improve the
current building. The long term
team will meet in the coming
months and years to find a loca-
tion for The New Trotter.

Syrian rebels
free hundreds
of inmates

Amid actions,
government key
captured as part of
offensive
BEIRUT (AP) - A suicide
bomber blew himself up at the
gates of a Syrian prison Thurs-
day and rebels stormed in
behind him, freeing hundreds of
inmates as part of an offensive
aimed at capturing key govern-
ment symbols around the north-
ern city of Aleppo, activists said.
Government forces, mean-
while, dropped crude "barrel
bombs" in deadly airstrikes as
both sides escalated their fight
for the strategic city ahead of
a second round of peace talks
set for next week. Opposition
leaders threatened to suspend
the talks over the barrel bomb-
ings.
In the past six days alone, the
makeshift weapons - contain-
ers packed with explosives, fuel
and scrap metal - have killed
more than 250 people in Aleppo,
including 73 children, accord-
ing to the Britain-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights.
They include at least 11 who
died Thursday - six of them
from the same family - in the
opposition-held neighborhood
of Masaken Hanano.
Videos uploaded by activists
showed the aftermath, includ-
ing men weeping amid ravaged
buildings and corpses covered
with blankets on the pavement.
"Be careful. There's a corpse
under your feet. .. It's a child!"
someone shouted. The videos
were consistent with reporting
by The Associated Press.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon deplored "the ongo-
ing aerial attacks and the use of
"barrel bombs"to brutal, devas-
tatingeffect in populated areas"

which violate international
humanitarian and human rights
law, U.N. spokesman Martin
Nesirky said.
in other developments, Syr-
ian President Bashar Assad's
government said it has reached
an agreement with the Unit-
ed Nations to let hundreds of
trapped civilians leave besieged
parts of the city of Homs and
permit U.N. humanitarian relief
convoys to enter.
In New York, U.N. deputy
spokesman Farhan Haq said
the United Nations welcomed
reports that the parties agreed
to "a humanitarian pause." He
said the U.N. and humanitarian
organizations have food, medi-
cal aid and other basic supplies
on the outskirts of Homs ready
for immediate delivery as soon
as "the green light" is given for
safe passage.
In Washington, U.S. State
Department spokesman Jen
Psaki welcomed the agreement,
which is expected to be carried
out on Friday, but warned: "We
should not be giving credit to a
regime just for providing food
for a few days to people who are
starving, given that's the right
moral thing to do. This is some-
thing they should have been
doing all along."
The rebels inAleppo declared
a push to seize the city's central
prison and the Kweiras military
air base to the east. Opposi-
tion fighters have been trying
to capture the installations for
months.
Thursday's offensive began
when a Chechen suicide bomber
from the al-Qaida-linked Nusra
Front attacked the prison gates,
according to the Observatory.
Rebel fighters then managed to
gain control of large parts of the
compound. By evening, heavy
clashes between the rebels and
soldiers were raging inside.

selections: senior first baseman

Anchoring Michigan's

Haylie Wagner and All-Big Ten

who, when combined, account-
ed for 50 of the Wolverines' 51
wins last season. Freshman
pitcher Megan Betsa - a two-
time Georgia State Player and
Pitcher of the Year in high
school - will add an extra layer
of depth to the already well-
accomplished group.
"We're definitely a pitching
staff, which is a huge advan-
tage for us," Driesenga said.
"We're all here to work with
each other and we're going to
complement each other."
Added Hutchins: "I've got
three pitchers that are capable.

Betsa isn't the only new
addition expected to make a

provide depth.
"I expect (the freshmen)
all to come in and hopefully
make an impact on Saturday,"
Hutchins said. "We're working
them all."
Though Michigan softball is
coming off of a successful 2013
season that included a trip to
the College World Series, one
thing is for certain: Hutchins
knowsthat lastyear has no bear-
ing on the upcoming season.
"You start at zero," Hutchins
said. "Nobody has a win or a
loss. The rankings don't mean
anything until June. That's the
only time rankings matter, is
when you're done. ... The game
doesn't know if you're ranked,
the game doesn't know if you're
a freshman or a senior, the game
knows if we play well or if we
don't."

as a varsity program - with only

will face off against
Texas, Duke and
Youngstown State
By MATTHEW KIPNIS
Daily Sports Writer
Though the bulk of conference
play hasn't begun, the Michigan
men's tennis team may already
be in the middle of its toughest
stretch of the entire season, and
handling the string of upcoming
opponents may be the Wolver-
ines' biggest challenge yet.
Michigan (3-2) has lost two
straight matches after winning
its first three. The Wolverines are
coming off a three-game stretch
against top-30 teams in which
they earned only one victory, and
it won't get any easier.
Eight of Michigan's next nine
opponents are nationally ranked.
Friday night, the Wolverines will
have their hands full with No.
10 Texas, and Sunday afternoon,
they'll face off against No. 13
Duke and Youngstown State.
"We are the in the middle of a
really difficult stretch in our sea-
son," said Michigan coach Bruce
Berque. "We've got some good
teams coming up, so we are going
to have to stay tough. We are not
going to win them all. We may
win some, we may lose some, but
if we can win half, it will put our

team in a great position."
The Wolverines do have an
advantage in that seven of the
nine matches will be played at
home in the Varsity Tennis Cen-
ter. Michigan is 75-25 at home
since 2005.
"It's like any other sport -
there is a little bit of an edge to
playing at home," Berque said.
"They are in their surroundings,
and the players are familiar with
the court speed and at the home
crowd. Our guys are in front of

eventually lost in the third round
of the main doubles draw.
"They haven't been playing
together as a team since then, but

it could help a little," Berque said.
"It is always nice to have a little
familiarity with the opponent."
Although Michigan didn't
get to play Texas in the Key Bis-
cayne Individuals in January due
to- poor weather canceling many
players' flights, they were able
to scout a few Texas players live
which could help them Friday
night.
In order to pull out victories,
the Wolverines will need solid
play from their doubles teams.
The doubles unit is lead by the
undefeated senior team of Buzzi
and Barnett Franks, who have
helped the team earn doubles
points in each of their first five
dual matches this season and an
overall 10-2 doubles record.
Michigan also hopes junior
Alex Petrone and senior Bar-
rett Franks can continue their
hot play. After losing his first
match of the season, Petrone has
won his last four, two of which
came against ranked opponents.
Franks has won three of his first
four singles matches to start the
year.
"We will be looking at the line-
up and try to figure out which are
the six guys we have to put on the
court," Berque said.
Against such stiff opposition,
the Wolverines will need con-
sistent play from their six sin-
gles matches to halt their losing
streak. ifthey falter, the schedule
ahead doesn't get any more for-
giving.

with Daily Collegian hockey writer Darian Somers
ByGREGGARNO
Daily Sports Editor
The No. 10 Michigan hockey team will travel to State College and the
recently opened Pegula Ice Arena for the first time in program history
this weekend. In its first year as a varsity program, Penn State hasn't
managed a conference win, but will aim to take advantage of two sold-
out crowds againstcthe Wolverines.
The Daily caught up with Daily Collegian sophomore hockey beat
writer Darian Somers to talk about goaltending, the atmosphere in State
College and the winner of a fightbetween Michigan coach Red Berenson
and Penn State coach Guy Gadowsky. The Daily Collegian's answers can
be found here.
Michigan will ride the hot hand of goaltender Zach
Nagelvoort into Pegula this weekend. How can Penn
State's offense find a way to beat one of the nation's best?
That's kind of been the question all season long. "How can
Penn State score?" The Nittany Lions are No. 1 in the nation
in shots per game at 35.55, but rank second-to-last in goals
per shots on goal. They need to just keep firing them, but they1
need to crash the net as well. They haven't had too many gar-
bage goals from in close this year. They need to jam one in.
Michigan's defense doesn't have a great deal of depth.
Who are some of the Nittany Lions on the third and
fourth lines who could capitalize on that?
There are two guys on this roster that could make an impact and seem
like they are on the cusp of doing that - Zach Saar, a big power forward,
and (forward) Ricky DeRosa, your typical Mark Rec-
chi-style player. Saar is a physical force. Off the ice,
he's a shy guy, but when he steps on the ice, I've actu-
ally seen people move out of the way of his shot. He's
also a little bit annoying in front of the net because
of that size. Guy Gadowsky has been using him for
that exact reason on the power play, and he's bound
to have a big game sometime soon. Then you've got
Ricky DeRosa. This guy doesn't do flashy things, but
he gets the job done and he gets it done well. When
he's on, he plays some of the best, unnoticed hockey
in the nation. He's not fast, and he's not the shiftiest,
but he's solid all around. He really takes pride in his
game.2
But Michigan does have depth at the forward position in guys
like JT Compher and Andrew Copp. Who has to step up to prevent
an onslaught?
This may sound like a generic answer, but it's going
to take everyone on Penn State's bench. They were
able to slow down Boston College's Johnny Gaudreau
and Kevin Hayes, plus they were able to shut down
Hudson Fashing and Kyle Rau from Minnesota. The
issue, though, is those teams are so deep they have
guys equally as good spread throughout their rosters.
If Penn State can shut down Copp and Compher, they
need to not forget about the rest of the Wolverines.
Does Penn State have the goaltending to bail out
its defense or special teams?
If you asked me this question the week before
last weekend's games with Ohio State, I would have
happily said yes, but I don't know anymore. Both
Matt Skoff and Eamon McAdam struggled. We've
seen them play some great hockey this year, espe-
cially McAdam of late, but this might have been
a big setback after losing both to a beatable Ohio
State team. McAdam has played really strong at
home as of late and he's probably going to see one
start this weekend. Both Skoff and McAdam give4
Penn State a chance to win and keep the Lions in
the game, but the offensive production doesn't always return the favor. If
the goalies can keep Penn State in the game and the offense is working,
Michigan could be in for a rough trip to Happy Valley. But that hasn't
happened often.... Wait, am I allowed to say Ohio State
to a Michigan man?

Has Pegula Arena played a role in home games
before this weekend and will it make a difference
this weekend againat a team that has never been to
State College?
It has some weekends and it hasn't others. When
Pegula is packed, especially the Roar Zone, the student
section, you can tell teams are rattled by it. I've never
been in an indoor building that loud. (Beaver Stadium
is the loudest place I've ever been to.) It's like a sound
wave that hits you right in the chest. When it's not
packed, you can tell Penn State plays
with less energy. It doesn't have an atmosphere and it's
like a completely different building. A lot of it depends
on the weather this weekend.
Who wins in a bare fist fight? Red Berenson
(mind you, he's 74 years old) or (Penn State coach)
Guy Gadowsky?
The real question is who wins in a bare fist fight: Red
Berenson or Chuck Norris. I'd bet Floyd Mayweather-
money on Red.
Who Wins?
Michigan and Michigan. Other than Minnesota, I don't think there is a
team hotter in the Big Ten right now.

eye season sweep
over Hawkeyes in
Iowa City
By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Two and a half weeks ago,
the Michigan men's basket-
ball team took care of Iowa at
home - its second consecutive
win as part of a three-game
sweep of top-10 teams, which
included Wisconsin and Mich-
igan State.
Saturday, the Wolverines
will head to Iowa City for
the rematch against the 17th-
ranked Hawkeyes in hopes of
securing a conference-best 10th
win.
Michigan (9-1 Big Ten, 17-5
overall) is coming off a 29-point
clobbering of Nebraska, bounc-
ing back from its first Big Ten
loss to Indiana earlier in the
week. Saturday's matchup fea-
tures a more talented Wolver-
ine team against a Hawkeye
team that has been dominant
at home. Iowa (6-4, 17-6) has
dropped just two games at Carv-
er-Hawkeye Arena this season
- an overtime loss to Michigan
State and aseven-point defeat to
Ohio State on Tuesday.
When Michigan and Iowa
met earlier this season, for-
wards Aaron White and Mel-
sahn Basabe kept the Hawkeyes
in the game, each contributing
17 points. The two average 13.3
and 7.8 points per game, respec-
tively, to complement an aver-
age of more than six rebounds
apiece.

But Iowa's biggest offensive
threat this year has been guard
Roy Devyn Marble. The 6-foot-
6 senior is averaging 16 points
per game this season on 41-per-
cent shooting from the field. At
Crisler Center though, he was
held to just 13 points. Sopho-
more guard Caris LeVert played
tough defense on him, forcing
him to shoot just 3-for-9 from
the field.
"Iowa's one of the top teams
in our league," LeVert said. "To
go in there and get a road win
would be huge for us."
The Wolverines will count

doesn't just shoot - he's also
been able to get points in the
paint, something he didn't do
with consistency a season ago.
Wednesday night he showed he
could contribute in other ways.
The 6-foot-6 guard dished a
career-best eight assists, setting
up teammates while he opted
out of shooting, attempting
just three shots. On Saturday
though, Stauskas will likely be
a bigger part of the scoring in
what should be a much more

competitive game.
And Michigan coach John
Beilein knows it will be a tough
matchup. Despite coming off of
a big win, Beilein knows there's
no such thing as an easy game in
the Big Ten.
"Where are the games on
the schedule where you can
say 'W'?" Beilein said. "Where
are they? I don't see them. I see
there's another game that we're
gonna have to compete like
crazy."
