E. coli case

Outbreak caused by
non-USDA regulated
strain of the bacteria
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily Staff Reporter
A lesser known form of E. coli -
yet to be deemed a contaminant by the
United States Department of Agricul-
ture - has caused at least 29 people in
Michigan, Ohio and New York to fall
ill.
Local laboratories were not pre-
pared to detect the particularstrain of
E. coli, which has afflicted at least ten
people inMichigan.
A May 6 press release from the
Center for Disease Control confirmed
that shredded romaine lettuce dis-
tributed by Freshway Foods of Sidney,
Ohio is responsible for the recent E.
coli 0145 outbreak at the University of
Michigan, Ohio State University and
Daemen College near Buffalo, New
York.
The investigation into the current
E. coli outbreak is ongoing. Freshway
Foods said it voluntarily recalled all
potentially contaminated products
shipped to 23 states, according to a
May 6 press release issued by the com-
pany.
There have been 19 confirmed
cases of E. coli-related illnesses asso-
ciated with this outbreak - nine of
which were in Washtenaw County -
with ten others who are potential car-
riers.
According to the CDC, 12 of the
29 afflicted persons were hospital-

Coleman approves
changes to code with
minor alterations
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
After receiving approval from Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Coleman,
several changes to the leading gov-
erning document for students will be
put into effect in July.
In a letter to Charles Koopmann,
chair of the Student Relations Advi-
sory Committee, Coleman wrote she
would accept all of the six proposed
amendments to the Statement of Stu-
dent Rights and Responsibilities.
However, Coleman noted two
changes she wanted to make to the
amendments
before they are
put into effect
later this sum-
mer. 2
"I am pleased-
to report that I
support all of the KYLE SWANSON
Student Rela-
tions Advisory
Committee's
recommenda-
tions, with two important modifica-
tions," Coleman wrote in the letter.
The first modification Coleman
made will changethe word "interven-
tion" to "sanction," which appears
throughout the third amendment to
the Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities.
Coleman wrote in the letter that
she wanted the change to be made
because it undermined the Univer-
sity's legal obligations.
"The Office of General Counsel
advised that the component of this
proposal that replaces the term
'sanction' with 'intervention' unin-
tentionally undermines the Univer-
sity's significant legal obligations to
hold students accountable for seri-
ous misconduct proscribed by fed-
eral and state civil rights laws and
higher education laws," Coleman
wrote.
Additionally, Coleman wrote that
she believed law enforcement offi-
cers would better understand the
word "sanction."
"Furthermore, as investigative
agencies are familiar with terms
such as 'sanctions' rather than

'interventions,' it is to the Univer-
sity's benefit to have formal policies
align with the expectations of regu-
latory authorities when possible,"
she wrote.
The rest of the third amendment,
which is meant to bring the language
of the student code in line with the
University's educational mission,
was approved without changes.
Coleman also accepted a modi-
fied version of the fourth proposed
amendment to the student code,
which is meant to include an adapt-
able conflict resolution option for
students in certain situations.
The proposed amendment listed
two examples for when adaptable
conflict resolution might be used -
in roommate disputes or drug- and
alcohol-related violations. But Cole-
man removed the two examples,
saying it would tie the University's
hands to list the two specific situa-
tions.
"The Office of General Counsel
advised that the sentence 'These
(adaptable conflict resolution) path-
ways may be available for a wide vari-
ety of conflicts, including roommate
disputes and/or incidents related to
alcohol or drug use' codifies OSCR's
process and commits the University
to a particular approach by listing
examples of how adaptable conflict
resolution is currently being used,"
Coleman wrote.
However, Coleman supported the
rest of the amendment, which means
more general language about the
possibility of adaptable conflict reso-
lution will be added to the revised
student code.
Four other amendments were
approved by Coleman without any
modifications, including an amend-
ment to the student code amendment
process and an amendment to make
the student code document gender
neutral.
Neither amendment makes policy
changes to the document; rather, they
make language changes so the docu-
ment is more inclusive and clearer on
the current process in place.
The other two amendments will
make intimate partner violence a
violation of the student code and will
bring the student code's nondiscrim-
ination policy in line with the Board
of Regents' policy.
The changes, which will go into
effect July 1, are expected to be
announced to University students
when they return to campus in the fall.

University researchers
develop novel approach
to extract oil from
microalgae
By ESHWAR
THIRUNAVUKKARASU
ManagingNews Editor
With about 210,000 gallons of oil
spilling into the Gulf of Mexico each
day, the recent explosion of a British
Petroleum oil rig off the coast of Loui-
siana has stymied discussion of off-
shore drilling and has reinvigorated
interest in alternative fuel sources.
Amidst mounting pressure to devel-
op affordable biofuels and reduce
dependence on foreign oil, University
researchers have recently developed
a hydrothermal process that extracts
crude oil from microalgae rather than
the ground.
Phillip Savage, professor of chemi-
cal engineering and lead investigator
for the project, said he and his team of

researchers sought to create a viable
fuel product for widespread use.
"The idea was to make a liquid fuel
compatible with the existing infra-
structure that is in place for transpor-
tationoffuel, the distribution network
and also use within existing engine
technology," he said.
According to Savage, the oil extrac-
tion process relies on a combination of
hydrothermal, chemical and biologi-
cal processing that takes advantage
of microalgae - simple microscopic
plants that lack leaves and roots - in
its natural wet state.
"My laboratory, over the years, has
done a lot of work on chemistry in
water at high temperatures and pres-
sures," he said. "So it occurred to us
that the research we've been doing
and the expertise we have on hydro-
thermal chemistry could be applied
here, becausethe algaegrow in water."
Savage continued, stating thatpres-
sure-cooking algae mimics the natu-
ral formation of petroleum from the
decay of ancient marine organisms,
which are subjected to extensive heat

COURTESY OF CNN
Stem cells like these are injected into the spinal cord ofean ALS patient in a new procedure developed from University prof. Eva Feldman.
Clinical trial first to apply
stem cells to combat AL

disease."
The trial has been ongoing at
Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia
since January. So far, three patients
have received the injections of stem
cells, but up to 12 patients may be
enrolled in the study.
Neuralstem, Inc. - a publicly trad-
ed biotherapeutics company based
in Maryland, which specializes in
the use of neural stem cells as a form
of biotechnology - is supplying the
stem cells for the study. The company
is funding the entire clinical trial at
Emory University.
Richard Garr, president and CEO
of Neuralstem, said the use of neural
stem cells isolated from humans in
the fetal stage of development is bet-
ter suited to the study as opposed to
embryonic stem cells.
Unlike the already differentiated
neural stem cells, embryonic stem
cells have the potential to develop into
any type of cell found in the body with
the proper stimulation.
Garr said the neural stem cells pro-
vided by Neuralstem do not require
the additional manipulation neces-
sary to coax embryonic stem cells to
develop into neural tissue.
"Think about the incredible com-
plexity of development and all of the
information that is exchanged between
the cells during the developmental
process," he said. "We think that that
is kind of hard to replicate in a couple
days in a (petri) dish. So we would say
that these (neural stem cells) are more
physiologically relevant. We don't have

to worry about what information these
cells do or do not have."
Garr added that, since ALS affects
nerve cells, theuse of neural stem cells
in the study is warranted.
ALS is characterized by death of
motor neurons in the spinal cord,
which control muscle movement. Pro-
gression of the disease to the muscles
of the diaphragm, which assist in
breathing, often causes the death of
ALS patients.
Feldman, who oversaw the surgical
implantation, said ALS leaves neurons
in a damaged state that can be sup-
ported by injected stem cells, accord-
ing to a May 4 interview with CNN.
"When we inject stem cells in the
spinal cord the stem cells surround
those large nerve cells and allow those
nerve cells to actually become less
diseased and, in fact, those nerve cells
begin to look healthy," Feldman said
in the interview.
The phase one trial will determine
if injecting fetal stem cells into the
spinal cords of adults is a safe proce-
dure and will show whether it is an
effective treatment for ALS, Feldman
wrote.
According to Garr, it could take
about six years to complete the first
phase of the trial.
"I recently told a new patient that
the situation is hopeful now. The
future is very bright. Not just for ALS,
but for patients with other neurologi-
cal diseases, including Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's and Huntington's," Feld-
man wrote.

Patients receive neural
stem cell injections in
new type of surgery
By HILLARY BOK
For the Daily
S John Cornick, a resident of North
Carolina, is not the first person to
be diagnosed with amyotrophic lat-
eral sclerosis - a neurodegenerative

disease that robs its sufferers of vol-
untary muscle movement. But he is
among the first to receive direct stem
cell injections to experimentally treat
the disease.
Leading a team in the first ever
FDA-approved stem cell procedure,
Prof. of Neurology Eva Feldman said
she hopes the landmark study will
bring aid to those suffering from the
effects of ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease.
After years of work, Feldman, direc-
tor of the A. Alfred Taubman Medi-

cal Research Institute, and her team
have been able to apply their stem cell
research to the phase one clinical trial
of the study of ALS. The trial marks
the first FDA-approved procedure in
which fetal stem cells are injected into
the spinal cords of adults.
"For 20 years, I could offer little
hope to my patients with ALS," Feld-
man wrote in an e-mail interview.
"Now, there is truly tangible hope. We
are testing a therapy that may allow us
to halt the progression of this terrible

Taking notice
City officials need a better approach to homelessness
J tspeaks volumes of the care homeless citizens receive from the
city of Ann Arbor when they are found living in forests rather than
the city's available shelters. Two weeks ago, state police officers
evicted residents of Camp Take Notice, a community of tents on a wood-
ed, unused patch of land near I-94, in an incident that has become a
nationally recognized embarrassment. This incident starkly illustrates
the city's misguided and shortsighted approach to homelessness. The
local government must respond to this problem by improving the acces-
sibility and quality of homeless shelters and services, not by evicting

I wasn't born yet when the Exxon Val-
dez tanker crashed into a reef outside of
Alaska and spilled millions of gallons
of oil into the Pacific Ocean. But BP has
made up for the fact that I missed that
catastrophe by creating one of its own.
On April 21, the explosion on the oil
rig "Deepwater Horizon" killed eleven
workers and created an oil spill the size
of Rhode Island. The well in the Gulf of
Mexico now leaks 5,000 barrels of oil
per day and has posed major environ-
mental and financial problems. Clean-
ing up this spill is going to take time and
money, and many scientists fear that
cataclysmic environmental damage has
already been done.
In spite of the irrefutable serious-
ness of this situation, politicians and
media figures have been discussing the
oil spill as though it's a debatable issue.
They need to realize that oil spills are
bad. They are always bad. There has
never been one that has been good. This
incident has devastated the habitats of
fish and the birds that prey on them.
The livelihoods of those in the fishing
industry have been threatened by the
fishing ban in the affected areas. Not
to mention that the explosion was the
direct cause of eleven tragic deaths. Let
me reiterate: the Deepwater Horizon oil
spill isn't a good thing.
Well, according to Rush Limbaugh,
"hardcore environmentalist wackos"
who think that the government's cur-
rent cap-and-trade bill is too weak
decided that "blowing up the rig" would
draw attention to the dangers of off-
shore drilling and gain support for their
cause. So, if you're a "hardcore environ-
mentalist wacko," then destroying the
environment was a plot on your part to
... help protect the environment? Some-
thing's not adding up here.
Sarah Palin has also jumped in on
the oil spill action. Her advice, relayed
via Twitter, was, "foreign oil co's: don't
naively trust." Thanks, Sarah Palin! It
would stand to reasonthenthatAmerican
oil companies are fully trustworthy. But
Exxon is an American company that was
also implicated in a disastrous oil spill.
Should we not trust anyone anymore?

Here's another fun one. Michael
Brown, former director of the Fed-
eral Emergency Management Agency,
is claiming that President Obama's
delayed response to this crisis has been
for political reasons because "he has
never supported big oil ... and now he has
an excuse to shut it back down.". Now,
maybe it's just me, but if my claim to
fame was the fact that I was the director
of FEMA during its failed response to
Hurricane Katrina, I would never speak
publicly again. Ever. I would especially
not speak publicly about a government
response to an environmental disaster
for fear that the hypocrisy would cause
the world to implode. But, again, that's
just me.
Needless to say, not all responses to
the Deepwater Horizon disaster have
been equally constructive. But consid-
ering the fact that the oil well has been
spouting millions of gallons of oil into
the ocean for weeks, I think it is safe to
say that all verbal responses are noth-
ing short of pointless. Talking about and
debating this problem doesn't stop the
leaking oil well.
Today's political climate has become
so partisan that many public figures
have lost sight of the fact that some
things are universally bad. Regardless
of your political orientation, race, eth-
nicity, sexual orientation or what have
you, environmental disasters negatively
affect everyone. Politicians and media
figures alike need to abandon the use-
less blame game because it isn't help-
ing anything. Once the spill has been
cleaned up, go ahead and point fingers
because it's a slow news day. But right
now, this is a serious problem that no
one is benefiting from.
Environmental dangers don't lean left
or right - they affect everyone equally.
As such, politicians and members of the
media need to form a united front on
this issue. They should dedicate them-
selves to efficiently cleaning up the oil
spill and supporting the people whose
lives have been devastated, not letting
politics take over once again.

their harmless resident;
Last month, Camp Take
Notice was given an ultimatum
to either move from its location
or face prosecution. The police
cited trespassing and problems
with domestic violence as jus-
tification for their longstanding
mission to disband the commu-
nity. The group was then forced
to move twice in August and
September of last year, following
the repeated arrest of its leader,
Caleb Poirer, according to The
Washtenaw Voice. It later set-
tled on the wooded state prop-
erty from which it was evicted
in late April, despite continued
protests by lawyers of the Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union.
What is unclear is why the
state and local police have made
such a crusade out of forcing
homeless Ann Arbor citizens off
of unused, wooded state land.
While there have been three
incidents of reported domes-
tic violence since its founding,
group representatives say the

camp has a strict non-violence
policy, and such violators are
told to leave. In fact, according
to its website, Camp Take Notice
actually seeks to "provide a safe,
sober and drug-free tent city."
The city authorities should not
displace a peaceful camp of
homeless people that poses vir-
tually no harm or inconvenience
to the general public.
The police fail to recognize
that the homeless have few other
choices, and, in many cases, a
self-governing, peaceful com-
munity in the forest is their best
option. State police cited health
hazards and a lack of facilities
as issues with the tent city, but
eviction solves neither of these
problems - it perpetuates them.
With only the Robert J. Delonis
Center providing regular shelter
for chronically homeless adults
in Washtenaw County as of
2008, evictiononly ensures that
another tent city will rise some-
where else in its place.
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

The larger problem is that
the homeless of Ann Arbor
don't receive the support they
need from the community. A
2008 Daily report estimated
that close to 4,000 Washtenaw
County residents would experi-
ence homelessness that year, a
number that has likely grown
in recent years and far outstrips
the living space available in local
homeless shelters (Everywhere
to go but home, 01/08/2008). If
the city truly wants to get rid
of these tent cities, it needs to
improve both access to and qual-
ity of homeless shelters, as well
as fight the root of the problem
with job training programs and
low-income housing projects.
The problem Ann Arbor resi-
dents should see in the tent city
isn't trespassing - it's poverty.
Instead of demolishing the
homes of Camp Take Notice res-
idents, the government should
ensure they have another place
to go.

Beyond jihad

BRUNO STORTINI

E-MAIL BRUNO AT BRUNORS@UMICH.EDU

April 26, a video surfaced
depicting Umar Farouk
Abdulmutallab training with
Al Qaeda in Yemen.
The "underwear
bomber," along
with other Muslim
radicals, is shown
firing AK-47s, prac-
ticing shooting
rocket-propelled
grenades and TYLER
preaching Al Qae- JONES
da's global jihad.
The video serves as
an uncommon glimpse into the real-
ity of terror indoctrination. Following
September 11, the psychology behind
indoctrination into terror organiza-
tions quickly became its own psycho-
logical sub-field, as the world asked,
"Why?" and terror experts asked,
"How?" This question of how individ-
uals are lured into a life of terror has
been extensively written on, lectured
about and taught in universities since
9/11. However, as government agen-
cies and academia continue to focus on
how individuals become terrorists, a
vital portion of terror psychology con-
tinues to be neglected: how to undo the
radicalizing effects of terrorism and
show our enemies a life beyond jihad.
After capturing a terrorist, the goal
is to extract as much actionable intel-
ligence as possible. But what happens
next is not exactly subject matter that
can be Googled. From what is known,
the individual is generally either
detained indefinitely or released. This
begs the question: Once a terrorist is
captured, is the goal to lock him away
forever or transform him into a peace-
ful member of society?
The field of terrorist de-radicaliza-
tion is relatively unknown. It involves
a vast knowledge of psychology as
well as regional understanding. It
requires an individual to say, "Sure, I
understand how you were recruited.
Now how do I bring you back?" Not
exactly the car chases and heart-
pounding material that makes for a
good episode of "24."
The Munasaha rehabilitation pro-
gram in Saudi Arabia is one of the
leading organizations that seek to
undo the radicalizing effects of ter-
ror groups. After an individual is
captured, he or she is assessed by two
sheikhs and a psychologist to deter-
mine the individual's psychological
state, ideology and how one affects
the other. The individual is then
enrolled in classes with the hope that
one day he or she can be reintegrated
into society.
The question now becomes why
America isn't implementing such
programs in its detention facilities.
Sure, every academic who has stud-

ied the Middle East has an opinion as
to why people become terrorists. But
that understanding is worth nothing
if we have no intention of tryingto fix
it. Understanding why an individual
becomes a terrorist - be it for psy-
chological, ideological or financial
reasons - will not better prepare us
to stop radicalization before it starts.
It is only valuable information if it is
then used to undo the radicalization
process.
Terror will not be
beaten with more
bombs or troops.
Of course, nobody wants to watch
Jack Bauer sit with an enemy com-
batant to discuss emotional attach-
ment problems. But this is where
real progress can be made in combat-
ing extremism. The ideologies that
threaten our nation do not disappear
with well-aimed Hellfire missiles, nor
can any ideology be combated sim-
ply with guns and treops. These are
intangibles that grow in coffee shops
and Koranic schools that will not dis-
appear with those who preach them.
In order to win the war on ter-
ror, we must turn the foot soldiers
of hatred against the ideologies they
so willingly die for. To accomplish
this, we must deprogram those who
inhabit our detention facilities, as
Guantanamo Bay and Bagram cannot
simply be warehouses for the world's
most dangerous terrorists. Along
with interrogation, these facilities
must work to undo the effects of ter-
ror indoctrination and show radicals
there are alternative means to exact-
ing change. This, certainly, is not easy.
It takes a tremendous understanding
of what these individuals want, what
they stand for and what voids within
themselves they are seeking to fill.
With every bomb we drop and
every village we raid, we give another
otherwise peaceful civilian a reason
to take up arms against America.
only when we establish programs
that address the real problems within
our enemies can we truly claim to be
uprootingterror. More than our Pred-
ator Drones or our surge of 30,000
troops into Afghanistan, our enemies
should fear our understanding. When
we understand who they are, we can
effectively turn enemies into allies
and show every Abdulmutallab that
there is life outside of jihad.

quite a lot about local goings-on.
Something happened, though,
when I went to college. I moved
away from my parents' house and
their breakfast table, and I didn't
want to spend the money for my
own subscription to the Free
Press. I transitioned from a knowl-
edgeable high school senior to an
oblivious college freshman, gath-
ering scraps of information from a
hodgepodge of Daily articles, web-
sites and briefings from my mother.
Unlike before, I had to work to
know what was going on around
me, and when an intensive Spanish
course and Nietzsche seminar took
over my life, I didn't have time for
such an effort.
Campus is a beautiful place,
especially in the spring and sum-
mer. On days when the sky is blue,
the lawnmowers are roaring and
the Triton fountain is sparkling,
it's hard to imagine being any-
where else. It's difficult to remem-
ber that this state has a 14-percent
unemployment rate, that this city
is a bright spot for development in
a slumping region and that we live
35 miles from the border of a city
in which 47 percent of adults are

functionally illiterate. It's much
more fun to just play Frisbee.
But think more broadly for a
moment. Find a computer, open a
web browser and zoom the Google
map out from Ann Arbor. It's time
to see where you live.
You're looking at southeast Mich-
igan, which is not easily defined,
but which I would call the cluster
of Detroit's suburbs and Ann Arbor.
You can try counting all the munici-
palities in this area, but it'd be tough.
There are currently 160 members of
the Southeast Michigan Council of
Governments, connected by at least
seven interstate highways and a web
of crisscrossing north-south streets.
While the sheer geographic span
seems daunting, the conflicting
interests and ideological differences
across the area can be overwhelm-
ing. The region encompasses every-
thing from bustling downtowns
to fields of grazing cows, from the
80-percent black population of
Detroit to the 95-percent white pop-
ulation of Livonia, bastions of both
Republican and Democratic lead-
erships, avenues of mansions and
blocks where only a few crumbling
bungalows remain.
History has shown that getting
this diverse group of cities and
townships to agree on something is
close to impossible. Whether it be
public transit funding, water distri-
bution or even library card access,
each municipality has its own stub-
born agenda: to protect and provide
for its unique segment of citizens in
the way that its leaders and resi-
dents see fit.
Being such an independent and
thriving city, Ann Arbor has had
the privilege of avoiding much of
the southeast Michigan squabble.
It provides its own water from the
Huron River, maintains an excel-
lent public transportation system
and stays partially isolated from

the region's economy thanks to the
University. But no unit of govern-
ment can avoid interconnectedness
and interdependence completely,
and eventually what impacts the
rest of the area will change Ann
Arbor as well. This city is part of a
region facing complex, distressing
problems but also a region in which
creativity, resourcefulness and
selflessness spring up in the most
unexpected places. You are also
a part of it, and you share in both
its setbacks and its advances. You
should get to know it.
Southeastern
Michigan is not
easily defined.
During my years at the Uni-
versity, I've learned how to stay
connected with the local commu-
nities that are important to me.
I still have pre-exam days where
the world seems less important
than the books in front of my face,
but in general, I know where to get
the information I need. Experien-
tial classes and internships have
also taught me that the only way to
really know what's going on in the
world is to see it for yourself. Go to
the farmers' market and talk to the
food providers about independent
farming in southeastern Michi-
gan. Go to local parks and see the
variety in municipal services. Go to
southwest Detroit and talk to resi-
dents about the plans for a second
international bridge. Whatever you
do, be interested, be inquisitive and
be engaged.

and pressure over millions of years.
Like the crude oil product that is
pumped from the ground, the algae
extract has unwanted components
of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur that
decrease the fuel's potential energy
output, Savage said.
"There's going to have to be addi-
tional work on converting what we
get from liquefying the algae into
something that would be more like a
hydrocarbon fuel," he said.
Savage added that the process for
oil extraction and refining is not nec-
essarily limited to microalgae but
rather can be applied to any form
of wet biological material, widening
the range of available sources for the
fuel.
"The general principle that the
application of heat, pressure and
water molecules can attack the mac-
romolecular structure of lots of dif-
TFA
From page 1
Under the terms of the recently
announced partnership with the Uni-
versity, TFA teachers will also enroll
at the University to obtain their state
teaching certificates.
"The University of Michigan was
selected as our 'university partner'
due to their innovative strategies to
prepare teachers for urban schools and
their commitment to helping our corps
members achieve as highly effective
classroom teachers," Offor wrote.
The University was the largest
contributor of applicants nationwide
to TFA in 2009, with 7 percent of the
year's graduates applying for member-
ship in the organization.
Deborah Ball, dean of the School
of Education, said she feels the school's
innovation comes from its attention
to the "specific training practices of
teaching," in which teachers are taught
practical classroom skills.
Ball said though the School of Edu-
cation has been involved with TFA in
the past, she is excited about the posi-
tive outcomes of this particular part-
nership.
"We're engaged in a common pur-
pose, which is to improve the quality of
teachers who are teaching our nation's
kids, so this was just a new opportuni-
ty to do it - a really exciting opportu-
nity," she said.
Ball said faculty in the School of
Education have previously discussed
a possible collaboration with TFA.
Similarly, TFA has also been interested
in working with the University and
has sent administrative members to
observe the School of Education's sum-
mer laboratory for elementary school
children.

ferent types of biomass should apply
in a general sense to things not lim-
ited to just algae," he said.
Because the project received fed-
eral grantfunding justlast September,
Savage said the oil extraction process
is still in its infancy. He added that
separation and catalytic treatments
are still pending in order to differen-
tiate the algae oil product for all uses
and remove contaminants, respec-
tively.
As current global use of fossil fuels
depletes natural oil reserves, Savage
said he remains hopeful that hydro-
thermal processing of biomass could
be a real future contender as a feasible
source of fuel.
"If the research is successful tech-
nically, then the next part will be to
see if it passes the economic hurdle
and the environmental hurdle," he
said. "There's nothing right now
that I can point to and say, 'here's an
obstacle that would prevent this (pro-
cess) from ever being a major player in
meeting our energy needs."'
"We are confident that our corps
members will be enriched by their
educational training at the University
of Michigan and will apply the knowl-
edge they gain to enhance their work
to advance educational outcomes for
underserved Detroit students," Offor
wrote.
Ball echoed Offor's positive senti-
ments, saying she is also pleased with
TFA's decision to return to Detroit, as
the school is deeply invested in the city.
"We're really committed to the
city of Detroit and Detroit's young peo-
ple, and the opportunity to be working
on improving the quality of beginning
teachers who would be working with
Detroit youth is very exciting to us,"
she said.
Because TFA members will be
interviewing for regular teaching
positions alongside district teachers,
some are opposed to the organization's
return to the city.
Keith Johnson, president of the
Detroit Federation of Teachers - a
union that represents teachers and
instructional support personnel in
Detroit - said he will not allow TFA
members to work in the city, as he feels
they will take away jobs from local
teachers.
"There's no way in the world that
Teach for America is coming into
(Detroit Public Schools) when I've got
1,983 teachers who've received layoff
notices," Johnson said.
Faced with TFA's move into the
city, Johnson said the organization
should try to work out an agreement
with the Detroit Federation of Teach-
ers. If it does not, Johnson said he will
go before court to file for injunctive
release, which would prevent TFA
from sending its teachers to the city.
TFA is also currently facing poten-

tial issues with its budget as Congress
is currently deliberating next year's
federal budget, which could impact
the amount of funding allocated to the
organization.
Under the provisions of the revised
Elementary and Secondary Education
Act, one proposal has been brought
before Congress to eliminate funding
to any specific group, forcing TFA and
other similar organizations to compete
instead for $235 million in grant fund-
ing.
Recent LSA graduate Joel Berger
- who will be working as a TFA mem-
ber in Detroit - said he feels that he
and his fellow teachers can help the
city only if they respect the existing
community and its members.
"I think the key thing for any
Teach For America corps member is
to realize going into Detroit that they
shouldn't view themselves as a savior,
because that's not what the city needs,"
Berger said.
Alton James, a recent Rackham
graduate and TFA teacher headed to
Detroit, said he understands some of
the anger directed towards the organi-
zation. But, as someone who grewup in
Detroit, James said the city's education
system could use some fresh faces.
"It's something new, something
exciting, something to invigorate edu-
cation right now in Detroit," James
said.
Berger added that he feels that
TFA's partnership with the University
is essential in assisting Detroit's pubic
school system.
"I think the University of Michi-
gan is a critical player in figuring out
how we're going to rebuild and revital-
ize the city," he said.

Wilgus appointment
ends five-month search
for new director
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily News Editor
The University's Office of Student
Conflict Resolution has a new direc-
tor as of Tuesday, after months of
interviews and narrowing down can-
didates, according to a press release
written by Simone Taylor, associate
vice president for student affairs and
director of the Career Center.
Jay Wilgus, assistant dean from
the University of Utah, has been
selected to be the next OSCR direc-
tor, beginning July 19, according to
the press release. Wilgus's new role
will consist of overseeing all work
done by OSCR, including receiving
and reviewing formal complaints by
students, mediation, determining the
severity of complaints and formal
resolution and appeal of complaints

made.
The search for a new OSCR direc-
tor began in December 2009 with
the departure of former director
Jennifer Schrage. Schrage became
director in Fall 2006 after working as
the director of the Office of Student
Judicial Services at Eastern Michi-
gan University.
Taylor made the final decision
after a search committee comprised
of students and faculty met with her
to discuss the candidates.
The committee narrowed the can-
didates down Wilgus and Jim Neu-
meister, the director of the Office
of Judicial Affairs at Northwestern
University, before making the final
decision.
During the interim period without
an official director, OSCR co-Man-
aging Directors Will Hathaway and
Dawn Marshall, along with Schrage,
took charge of guiding the office
through the transition.
The press release stated that
Wilgas intends to continue to use
the Spectrum model, developed by
Thompson and Shrage in 2008.

E. coli
From page 1
ure. All of the patients affected by
the bacteria reported symptoms of
their sickness between April 9 and
April 16, according to a Washtenaw
County Public Health press release
issued on May 6.
Most strains of E. coli do not
cause illness, but ingestion of those
that produce Shiga toxin - like the
E. coli 0145 found in the lettuce
- can cause symptoms of illness
that include diarrhea and stomach
cramping. In severe cases, afflicted
patients may contract hemorrhagic
colitis - an infection characterized
by abdominal cramps, bloody diar-
rhea and kidney failure.
The USDA currently only recog-
nizes E. coli 0157 as a harmful bac-
terial strain, leading most bacterial
laboratories to test for only the one
type.
Susan Cerniglia, the public
information officer for Washtenaw
County Public Health, said the lack
of USDA regulations on non-0157
Shiga toxin-producing strains may
have been partially responsible for
the outbreak.
"A lot of (laboratories) didn't
have the capacity in place to detect

this bug," Cerniglia said. "Thatkind
of hampered things."
Bill Marler, a Seattle-based per-
sonal injury lawyer with experi-
ence in food-borne illness litigation,
said this outbreak could help push
the USDA to consider implement-
ing testing regulations for non-0157
strains of E. coli.
"Not that I wish illness on peo-
ple, but the timing of the 0145 out-
break...is certainly going to get the
USDA to have to respond," Marler
said. "Over the last 15 years, there
(have been) a lot of cases of ill and
sick and dead people who haven't
been linked to E. coli 0157 but cer-
tainly had symptoms consistent
with an E. coli illness."
According to Marler, testing for
other harmful strains would be
neither difficult nor unreasonably
expensive. The recent outbreak, he
said, should serve as a wake-up call.
"If no one forces you to do some-
thing, you tend not to do it," Mar-
ler said. "I think government and
industry have gotten comfortable
doing 0157 testing, and those other
bugs are the devil you don't know.
If you're not testing for it, you don't
find it, and if you don't find it, you're
not doing anything for it."
Marler said he was "frustrated

pon Baseball and Softball Complex.


and a bit incredulous" that the
government still wasn't testing for
non-0157 strains, so he started his
own research into the prevalence of
these unregulated bugs in 2008.
After hiring a lab to run tests
for non-0157 strains in hamburg-
er meat, Marler said the results
showed that 1.9 percent of the first
1,000 samples contained the
harmful bacteria. The lab, he
said, sent the results to the USDA
at the time but did not receive a
response.
The testing, which extended
to 5,000 samples, will conclude in
June, and the study's results willbe
published in July, Marler said. The
results consistently showed that
about 2 percent of the meat con-
tained non-0157strains of E. coli.

"(Two percent) may not sound
like a lot," he said. "But if you think
about it and extrapolate it...it's a
pretty big number."
Marler said he filed a petition
with the USDA in October last
year to label the top five non-0157
strains, including 0145, as adulter-
ants, but the USDA has been slow to
respond to the request.
U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-
NY), who is another advocate for
regulations in the testing of the
other harmful strains, said she has
been urging U.S. Secretary of Agri-
culture Tom Vilsack to take action
on the issue as well.
Marler added that it is crucial to
get these regulations in place now
because of the way bacteria evolve.
In 50 years, he said, 0157 could be

one of the less prominent strains
and one of the currently unregulat-
ed ones could move to the forefront.
"Like they adapt, we have to
adapt," Marler said. "That's the
relationship we have with patho-
genic bacteria, and if we don't
adapt, they kill us - that's their
job."
According to Cerniglia, whether
or not the USDA changes its regu-
lations, local labs in Washtenaw
County will be more wary of the
non-0157 strains in the future.
Some labs, she said, will- even be
equipped to deal with the harmful
types of bacteria like E. coli 0145
within the next few months.
"We're more aware of some of
the problems detecting this type of
bug," Cerniglia said.

and their long shared history shows.
As the StarKids discuss their highly
anticipated "A Very Potter Sequel,"
the jokes never cease to spark.
The idea for the original "A Very
Potter Musical" ("AVPM") arose
after years of the same sort of joking
about the Harry Potter book series,
but friends of brothers and writers

Nick and Matt Lang never thought
the parody musical would material-
ize.
After Matt Lang, a 2009 LSA gradu-
ate, spontaneously put up a poster for
auditions last year, Basement Arts
picked up the show, and the play was
born.
Even though fans flooded Studio
One to see the original Potter show,
when the team uploaded the video
to YouTube months later it was still
shocked by the rapid fervid response.
"Without us even noticing, thou-
sands and thousands of people started
to watch this thing," said Nick Lang,
a 2008 graduate from the School of

CONCERT PREVIEW
Local Natives visit A2
Local Natives
Tonight at 8 p.m.
The Blind Pig
$10
Last spring, the South by Southwest Festi-
val set the whole country abuzz with praise for
a group of young musicians who ran across the
streets of Austin with palpable fervor - instru-
ments in hand - to play back-to-back sets at sev-
eral different venues.
This band, known as Local Natives, played
nine shows in total during that festival. Luckily
for Ann Arbor, Local Natives will be bringing
their hymnal hippie harmonies to the Blind Pig
tonight.
The origin of Gorilla Manor - the acclaimed
album's tongue-in-cheek title - is solely a matter
oflivingconditions. When the bandmates moved
to the avant-garde Silver Lake neighborhood of
Los Angeles, their communal home was in a con-
stant state of tumult. In an interview with the
Daily, Natives drummer Matt Frazier deemed
the album title "a good representation of who we
are as a band."
"Chaotic, both in terms of the recording pro-

cess and living conditions," as Frazier said,
Gorilla Manor - the housing situation as well as
the album - was also "the best experience of our
lives."
From the chaos of the "Gorilla Manor," soli-
darity was born. The collaborative nature of the
Local Natives' living experience is evident in
their musical style. The drumming is frenetic
and tribal and resembles community campfire
music, while the vocals are characterized by
continuous two and three-part harmonies (sung
by lead vocalist Taylor Rice, keyboardist Kelcey
Ayer and guitarist Ryan Hahn) that lend more
weight to the profound meaning of each song.
A prime example of this holistic sound can be
heard in "Airplanes," which was written as a
tribute to Ayer's late grandfather.
The Natives' homey vibes should hold signifi-
cant appeal for prospective attendees of their
Ann Arbor show. Frazier expressed enthusiasm
about the band's ability to please the college
town crowd.
"We're extremely comfortable with the pros-
pect of playing in Ann Arbor," he said. "Every
member of the band is well past college age, and
we've learned a great deal about each other as
we've grown together, so yes, we're definitely
excited."

FILM REVIEW
Too many 'Babies'
Babies
At the Michigan
Focus Features
It's hard not to love babies. Their gurgling
coos and drooling little faces are inexplica-
bly irresistible. Especially to mothers, who
dote on their red-faced spawn with unwav-
ering adoration. And "Babies" - delivered in
a timely fashion for Mother's Day - plays on
that matronly affection which the film's tar-
get demographic possesses.
The documentary follows the first year in
the lives of four infants from four corners of
the world. Ponijao lives in Namibia in a small
village with numerous siblings. Mari lives in
Japan in a cosmopolitan setting as an only
child. Bayarjargal (nicknamed "Bayar") lives
in Mongolia on a farm with his nuclear fam-
ily, and Hattie lives in California with her
Bohemian, eco-friendly parents. But while
all four infants come from extremely diverse
backgrounds, they're unified through com-
mon experiences in their first year growing

up.
The film presents its protagonists from a
baby's-eye view, while audience members,
consequently, are taken step-by-step through
the different stages of each child's life with a
limited perspective that makes viewers iden-
tify and sympathize with the babies. Adults
in this documentary are merely shadowy,
auxiliary characters. Audience members, in a
sense, become babies through the low-angle,
baby-centric view that filmmaker Thomas
Balmes takes. But unless you're an actual
baby (and if you're reading this review you
certainly aren't) the experience can get frus-
trating.
As expected, the documentary is little
more than a fluff piece, uniting different cul-
tures by painting unrealistic portrayals of
happy families through rose-colored lenses.
Struggles of abject poverty are trivialized,
minimalized or done away with completely.
While the documentary has some moments
that could make even the most cynical (and
childless) of film watchers' hearts soften, the
perpetually forced, cutesy nature of the film
is eventually cloying. So unless you're gaga
for babies, this 90-minute homage to them
can be a dear price to pay.

POTTER

atre & Dance graduate), are thor-
oughly satisfied with the final
script. Without giving the plot
away, they said the sequel adds new
characters and draws heavily from
the first, third and fifth books.
"It's better than anything I
thought we could have done," Matt
said.
Although the six-month writing
process was taxing throughout,
the team hopes the shows will be
the opposite.
"It's really the first time all
of us will be in a room together
since this thing has taken off, and
I think it will be less stressful and
more of just, 'This is awesome,' "
said Joey Richter (Ron Weasley), a
senior in the School of Music, The-
atre & Dance.
The main purpose of the live
shows is to film the YouTube video
to be launched in July. All of the
free tickets for the 100-person the-
ater have been reserved, but there
will be a standby line.
While many of the friends
have dispersed since "AVPM" last
year, the original cast and crew

gave themselves the name Team
StarKid after their YouTube suc-
cess so they could accept dona-
tions. The StarKid brand also
produced the Basement Arts musi-
cal "Me and My Dick" last fall and
the Web series "Little White Lie."
"A Very Potter Sequel" is another
incarnation of their "last project
together," Matt said.
"When I did the original musi-
cal, I said, 'This the last show I'll
ever do,' and then I did two more,
so it could very well change," Matt
explained.
While members will most likely
move on from StarKid to individual
careers, prospects look hopeful due
to the success of their productions.
"We've got industry people pay-
ing attention, and really that's how
you start out," Nick Lang said. "It's
helped our reputation; it's techni-
cally hurt our careers, because
we've spent all of our money. But
your reputation is gold."
The team consistently hears
from admirers that it makes the-
ater for its generation.
"Although our teachers don't
know how to do it, they know
we know how to do it," Gruesen
explained. "It's exciting that we
get to make theater for our friends

and our friends' friends."
Jamie Lyn Beatty (Ginny Wea-
sley), who graduated from the
School of Music, Theatre & Dance
this spring, agrees that StarKid
takes theater in a modern direction.
"It is a new form of theater
because it's so self-conscious,"
Beatty said. "So many of the scenes
in the musical make fun of the fact
that there is an audience or that the
props are made of cardboard, and
there's something really charming
about that for an audience to wit-
ness."
No matter what StarKid mem-
bers pursue, they will bring with
them the optimism and positivity
that has surrounded their produc-
tions thus far.
"It's easy to be pessimistic
because it's easy to find ways the
world sucks - the world kind of
does suck," Matt said. "But it's
hard to find truthful reasons to
think about something in an opti-
mistic way."
After all of the Potter shows'
parodic plot spirals, Matt hopes
the show will coax smiles from
viewers in the end.
"We always want to end up with
something that makes you feel
good."

In 2008, Jon Favreau - the Jew-
fro-sporting comic whose film career
includes supporting
turns in "Swingers,"
"Elf" and "The Break- *
Up" - surprised film honMan 2
and comic book gurus
alike when he directed At Quality16
the politically relevant, and Showcase
morally reverent first Paramount
"Iron Man" movie.
Well, step aside "Iron
Man," because your updated, prima
donna brother is in town.
Lucky for you, many of his charac-
ters are miscast and his script is filled
with hyperbolized plot threads sure to
alienate even some of the most lenient
movie enthusiasts. By now, the origi-
nal "Iron Man" franchise has devolved
to the extent that it is indistinguishable
from anytother stock superhero film. Rest
assured, predecessor, your placement as
one of the best comic book adaptations in
recent memory is still quite safe.
Now, hyperbole in the context of a
superhero movie may seem appropriate
to the genre, but not when a sequel relin-
quishes its political vision and completely
falls offtheproverbial wagon, riddlingits
two-hour narrative (especially the first
half-hour) with arbitrary cameos, flat
character expression and a five-minute
drunken battle between best friends clad
in Iron"Man"suits. Ultimately, viewers are
left with nothing but an emotional hang-
over and the distinct impression that
they've just seen bad reality television.
Naysayers, just watch the entirety of the
Stark Expo scene at the beginning before
you disagree.
Overall, "Iron Man 2" resembles
something closer to a Mel Brooks farce
or a slapstick comedy when compared
to its predecessor. It's far removed from
the subtle, classy drollness of Robert
Downey, Jr.'s performance in the first
film. The Iron Man comic was originally
conceived as a commentarv on the Cold

War. In keeping with the spirit of intel-
lect that inspired the first Iron Man
comic, Jeff Bridges's flexible acting abili-
ties were a perfect complement to the
intelligent (but wildly entertaining) dis-
course of the first "Iron Man" movie. His
role as the embittered former partner of
Tony Stark's father was an excellent illus-
tration of the conflict between greed,
warfare and ethics.
Not so in the case of Mickey Rourke
("The Wrestler"). His portrayal of Ivan
Venko, the sequel's villain, seems like a
questionable choice. Rourke said in an
interview that Ivan's trademark gold
teeth and beloved parrot were paid for
from his own pocketnmoney in an attempt
to render his character less "one-dimen-
sional." Well, suffice to say, it's hard not
to seem one-dimensional when you have
scarcely 80 words of dialogue in a two-
hour movie. But maybe it's better that
way; the best part of "The Wrestler" was
the brutal honesty of Rourke's role, and
the demeanor one would expect of Venko
- a brilliant physicist's psychotic son -
simply doesn't befit Rourke as an actor. At
least he played the wrestler role well.
Some sequels just
shouldn't be made.
In its defense, "Iron Man 2" gets much
better after the confounding 30-minute
introduction, and Downey, Jr. possesses
the same snappy poise that made his
superhero debut a spectacular one. The
bright, colorful "Speed Racer"-style cin-
ematography makes for some spectacu-
lar action sequences. But in its attempt to
straddle the wide gap between dramnedy
and action film, "Iron Man 2" makes a
few errors of judgment that diminish the
cerebral character of the first film and
provide us with only the flashy, mind-
numbing, three-act entertainment we
expect from I-movies. Even so, be sure
to watch all the way through the ending
credits -hint, hint.

'M' sweeps Spartans

The No. 2 Michigan softball team
entered this weekend's series against

In last MICHIGAN STATt 1
year's final
regular season game, a relatively weak
Spartan lineup upset the Wolverines
2-1 and ended their 21-game winning
streak in the process.
In this year's renewal of the home-
and-home series, Michigan's in-state
rival wasn't given the same chance, as
the Wolverines shut out the Spartans
10-0 in Ann Arbor and won 4-1 in East
Lansing.
"Obviously, it taught us a lesson
last year, and that was to go out there
and don't take anyone lightly," senior
leftfielder Angela Findlay said. "You
got to go out there, and you have to
play the same, whether you're playing
Michigan State, Kentucky (or) Ala-
bama."
Saturday's matchup at Alumni
Field was the last regular season
home game for Michigan's five senior
starters - catcher Roya St. Clair, des-

ignated player Nikki Nemitz, third
baseman Maggie Viefhaus, center-
fielder Molly Bausher and right fielder
AngelaFindlay. They were honored on
the field alongside their parents before
the game.
And it was a pair of those seniors
who owned the night.
St. Clair put on a show on both
sides of the ball, as she smacked two
doubles, drove in one run and scored
another.
From behind the plate, she showed
her prowess, gunning down Spar-
tan Karen Fox at second base in the
second inning. Findlay also had a big
day, as she drilled a two-run homer to
right center in the second inning and
scored two runs.
"I just watch (the seniors), and I'm
really proud," Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins said. "I'm like a mom. I'm
sad.
"I never look forward (to) this day
- I'm always kind of nervous about
it."
Junior first baseman Dorian Shaw
added to Michigan's power display
with her team-leading 18th homer
of the season in the second inning.
Sophomore second baseman Aman-
da Chidester contributed three RBI
of her own on a solo shot in the sec-
ond frame and hits in the third and

fourth.
Junior pitcher Jordan Taylor got
the nod on Saturday. She pitched five
innings of one-hit ball, striking out
nine and walking none in the effort.
Sunday afternoon's matchup at
Old College Field in East Lansing had
a much different look than the day
before, as Spartan starting pitcher
Lauren Kramer, who was forced from
the mound after two innings of work
on Saturday, allowed just two hits
through the first six innings.
Michigan State held a 1-0 lead
entering the seventh inning - it was
just the second time all season that
Michigan hadn't scored heading into
the final frame.
"I was thinking the same thing the
whole game, 'What is wrong with
this place?' " Chidester said. " 'I do
not want to come out of here with
another loss like last year.'"
But that was when the wheels
came off for Kramer.
A down-and-in pitch to start the
inning got away from her, hitting
Viefhaus in the ankle. In the follow-
ing at-bat, Kramer mishandled St.
Clair's sacrifice attempt, allowing the
senior to reach base.
Then, after hitting Shaw on the
thigh, Kramer loaded the bases.
Chidester stepped into the batter's

box and wasted no time. With one
swing of the bat, she smashed a grand
slam far beyond the left-field fence,
handing the Wolverines (16-1 Big
Ten, 44-6 overall) an insurmount-
able three-run lead.
"(We weren't). swinging at our
pitches," Chidester said. "Swinging
at her pitches was the big thing, and
once we settled down and started
swinging at our pitches that we need-
ed to swing at, things started to turn
around for us."
Nemitz came back to the mound in
the bottom of the seventh to finish off
the Spartans. She gave up just three

hits on the day, striking out 10 and
walking two.
Hutchins credits her players' abil-
ity to focus on one pitch at a time for
the late breakthrough in Sunday's
game against the Spartans (4-14,
20-30).
"We try to stay focused on one-
pitch (softball), and I think you see
when we get away from it," Hutchins
said. "It's clear as day.
"If you start visioning last season's
ending, you start visioning negative
thoughts. And if you start trying too
hard to get a hit, you're not playing
Michigan softball."

Bauer leaves a lasting legacy on program

By MATT KRASNOFF
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's golf team's
season has soon ended and, for one
graduating senior, it was the final
season of a brilliant career.
Senior Ashley Bauer was invited to
play as an individual this past week-
end at the NCAA Central Regional.
Since the team did not qualify for the
NCAA Tournament, Bauer traveled
to Columbus, Indiana alone. Just two
other golfers were there as individu-
als, and Bauer would have to finish in
the top two of the three individuals
in order to advance to the next tour-
nament.
Unfortunately, Bauer came up a
little short. Her final score of 29 over-
par tied her for 76th overall and third
among the three individuals.
Bauer battled winds of up to 30
miles per hour throughout the tour-
nament, and watching her struggle
in the final weekend of her collegiate

career was difficult for her coach of
four years.
"It was tough for me, because I
know how bad she wanted to play
well," Michigan coach Cheryl Stacy
said. "To finish off the year on kind
of a bad note was sad because she had
such a great Big Ten Tournament."
To most people, this tournament
was like any other, but for Bauer,
competing alone was a different
experience to say the least.
"Everything from going out to din-
ner, to staying in the hotel by myself
was pretty different," Bauer said. "It
was kind of an emotional weekend,
without the team being there and the
season ending."
But some of the team actually was
there.
Bauer's two younger sisters -
Meagan and Shana - who both play
on the team came along for support
with the rest of the family, and Stacy
said watching the family together
after Ashley completed the tourna-

ment was one of her fondest memo-
ries of the season - Stacy's first as
Michigan's head coach.
"(Ashley) was the best example of
what a Michigan athlete should be, as
far as what she did week-in and week-
out, her work ethic and her leadership
"(Ashley) was the
best example of
what a Michigan
athlete should be."
skills," Stacy said. "She's probably one
of the more coachable players I've had
the honor to coach. She's very respect-
ful and just a great person."
Bauer - who was recently named
first team All-Big Ten - has been
an "iron woman" for Michigan. She

played and started in all 48 events
that took place during her four-year
career.
Bauer also holds countless records
foraprogramthatposted itsbestteam-
scoring average in the last five years.
She is the all-time record holder for a
single-season scoring average (74.51).
She also holds the record for the
best single-round total (65) and the
record for the best score in 18, 36, 52
and 72-hole tournaments.
"She's broken almost every record,
and people are going to talk about Ash-
ley Baer for a long time," Stacy said.
"She's going to inspire so many golfers,
because all the girls are going to try to
beat her records. She set a standard
and I think as a new head coach that's
something that I'm really proud."
But even with all the wins and
records, Bauer hopes future Wolver-
ines simply recognize her commit-
ment and attitude.
"I loved it, so I hope I was some-
body who came to practice with a

smile and worked hard while I was
there," Bauer said. "I couldn't have
asked for anything better."
With her career at Michigan over,
Bauer is already looking toward the
future. She will have a few weeks off
before traveling to Spain on June 4,
where she will represent the United
States in the World Collegiate Cham-
pionship.
And with the real world setting in
for one of Michigan's best-ever female
golfers, Bauer embodies and endorses
an important message for her team -
especially her younger sisters.
"As it all closes, I just want them to
take advantage of every opportunity
while they're (at Michigan)," Bauer
said. "I don't think a lot of people real-
ize what's in front of them until it's
over.
"So make the most of it, practice
hard, and leave your mark here at
Michigan, because we're all so lucky
to be part of a wonderful opportu-
nity."

After Saturday's game against
Michigan State, senior outfielder
Kristin Larsen's head got chewed
off - but it wasn't due to poor per-
formance, and it wasn't by one of her
coaches.
"I need to find Kristin, I'm eat-
ing her head right
now," sophomore NOTEBOOK
second baseman
Amanda Chidester voiced after the
No. 2 Michigan softball team's 10-0
victory over the Spartans.
It was Senior Day at Alumni
Field, and a cake decorated with a
picture of the seniors served as part
of the celebration in the Wolver-
ines' final home game of the regular
season.
All six senior Wolverines were
honored before the game, as each
walked one-by-one with their par-
ents and stood in front of the Michi-
gan dugout along the first-base line.
"It's special for our parents to be
down there," senior catcher Roya St.
Clair said. "They've supported us all
growing up. Since we were little, tak-
ing us to the travel-ball tournaments,
traveling all over the country. I know
it's got to be exciting for them to be
down there."
The heralded class included two
first-team All Americans, two others
that have been All-Big Ten selections
and a Pitcher of the Year from 2008,
as well as a host of other contributors
- and that's with its final year still
unfinished.
As Michigan's head coach for 26
years, Carol Hutchins has witnessed
the emotional day many times.
"We all know that the most impor-
tant thing is they've just been a great
team and they've been part of a lot of
greatteams," Hutchins said. "They're
just really good people.
"And that's really a key ingredi-
ent to successful programs - having
good people."
As freshmen, the six current
seniors replaced the 2006 graduat-
ing class, which included standout
pitcher Jennie Ritter and two other
All Americans - catcher (and now
assistant coach) Becky Marx and sec-
ond baseman Tiffany Haas.
That class also helped Michigan
win its first national championship in
2005 as juniors - something the cur-
rent crop of seniors is still looking to
accomplish.

"We thought we had a great
recruiting class. But they've really,
I think, exceeded (expectations),"
Hutchins said. "Their freshman year
they were all in the lineup except
for (Larsen). They played every day
basically, and we made it to the third
game of the Super Regional."
Just like the rest of the year, the
seniors got it done on the field Satur-
day, with five of the six reaching base
and three recording at least one RBI.
"It's pretty awesome, as a sopho-
more, to see your whole senior class
step in and do something big. one
time or another," Chidester said.
"Seeing them take charge out there
on that field makes me and my soph-
omore class want to be able to have
our underclassmen look up to us like
that, too."
ENTER THE PINK ZONE: Yesterday
was not just Senior Day for the Wol-
verines, but it was a day to help raise
breast cancer awareness by sporting
pink jerseys.
The team auctioned off the six
senior jerseys to help raise money
for the organization Making Strides
Against Breast Cancer.
"I always say I work with the over-
privileged," Hutchins said. "They
get a lot of things handed to them.
They've worked hard but they live
the life. They go to practice and they
work very hard but what a great life
to have and not everybody has such
great opportunities.
"So I think it's our duty to help
them realize that they need to give
back to society and help make this a
better place."
MICHIGAN SOFTBALL ACAD-
EMY: As part of the charity effort,
the Wolverines held the first annual
Michigan Softball Academy on Fri-
day evening.
Hutchins and the entire Michigan
team took part in the events, high-
lighted by the six seniors choosing
teams as captains to compete in
various skill-based competitions.
But it wasn't the players that
stole the show.
Several parents were the talk of
the event, including the mothers of
freshman Jaclyn Crummey, junior
Jordan Taylor and, especially, soph-
omore Stephanie Kirkpatrick.
"Linda Kirkpatrick, boy, she was
impressive," Hutchins said after
Saturday's game. "She did a back
flip during warm ups.
"So clearly, I've got the wrong
people playing."
