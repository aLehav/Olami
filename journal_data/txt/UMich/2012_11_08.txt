Throughout its 100 years, Hill Auditorium has hosted acclaimed speakers such as Eleanor Roosevelt and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The concert
hall was designed by Detroit architect Albert Kahn, who used reinforced concrete and other architectural elements to give Hill its famous acoustics.

Results delayed as
several counties
slow to report
vote tallies
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
Riding the coattails of the
national ticket, Democratic
nominees- for the University's
Board of Regents Shauna Ryder
Diggs and Mark Bernstein nar-
rowly prevailed over Republican
nominees Robert Steele and Dan
Horning in Tuesday's election.
University regents are elected
on a statewide ballot. As of 10:30
p.m., Bernstein and Diggs are up
to 2,135,360 and 1,891,284 votes,
respectively, compared to Steele's
1,595,608 votes and Horning's
1,590,603 votes.
Bernstein and Diggs's vic-
tory will continue the Demo-
crats' current 6-2 majority on
the board. The two newcomers
will replace outgoing Democratic
members S. Martin Taylor (D-
Grosse Pointe Farms) and Olivia
Maynard (D-Goodrich).
When returns began com-
ing in from around the state at
about 11:00 p.m. Tuesday, Horn-
ing and Steele took an early lead,

benefiting from primarily rural
and strongly Republican report-
ing counties. However, even as
more suburban districts began to
submit results, the race became
more competitive throughout
the evening and into Wednesday
morning.
The result was not definitively
determined until early Wednes-
day afternoon when Wayne
County - a primarily Demo-
cratic area that includes Detroit
- registered 1.4-million votes,
of which Bernstein and Diggs
received 547,407 and 503,560
respectively, placing them ahead
of their Republican challengers.
As of 11:30 a.m. Wednesday,
Diggs had been running in last
place among the four candi-
dates but now leads Horning and
Steele by about 300,000 votes
each. Bernstein leads each of the
Republicans by more than half a
million votes.
As of 10:30 p.m., only Genesse
County, which is a Democratic
stronghold, had not yet reported
its results.
Speaking from the statewide
Democratic Party election event
in Detroit, Bernstein said he was
thrilled by the success that his
campaign had achieved.

possibility of being able to serve

Two GOP justices
also elected to the
state's high court
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
With 97 percent of precincts
across the state reporting, it
appears Justice Stephen Mark-
man, a conservative, and Uni-

versity Law Prof. Bridget Mary
McCormack, a liberal, will
assume seats on Michigan's
Supreme Court to retain the
court's 4-3 conservative major-
ity.
Markman will keep his seat as
the incumbent, and McCormack
will replace retiring liberal Jus-
tice Marilyn Kelly, who was not
eligible to run again due to age.
Justice Brian Zahra, a conser-
vative whom Republican Gov.

Rick Snyder appointed last year
to filla partial term, also secured
his seat by beating out Sheila
Johnson, the liberal challenger,
by a margin of 50-41. Mindy
Barry, an independent challeng-
er, garnered the remaining 9 per-
cent of the vote. Zahra will serve
on the court until Jan. 1,2015.
McCormack led Markman
slightly in overall votes with
each having about 23 percent of
the popular vote. The nearest

challenger, Republican-backed
Colleen O'Brien, trailed Mark-
man by more than 100,000 votes
as of 6:30 p.m.
Speaking at a Democratic
rally in Detroit Tuesday evening,
McCormack said she was proud
of the way her campaign was
conducted,,and she looks for-
ward to assuming her place on
the bench.

SLAM DUNK

The mechanics of memory

Why did you choose to
come to the University of
Michigan?
First and foremost it was
the people. I really love the
energy and engagement of
the people here, both faculty
and students. There is also an
amazing amount of research
thathappens here, across a lot
of different departments and
schools, yet despite the size
of the University of Michigan,
there is still a great sense of
collaboration and community.

This semester I am teachin
a seminar entitled Neurobiol
ogy of Learned Fear. The goa
is to focus on one type of mem
ory task - fear conditioning -
and discuss how the research
on this task has advanced ou
understanding of learning an
memory.
How did you becom,
interested in researchini
learning and memory? Haw
you been able to incorporat(
any of your research result
into your teaching?

g research that was happening
- at my undergraduate depart-
.1 ment, particularly in my men-
- tor's lab. I stayed interested
- because learning is an expe-
h rience we all have - we are
x always learning. Memory is
d fundamental to how we view
ourselves, how we think of
the past, how we behave in the
e future, and how we feel. But
g what we don't know is how
e the brain stores memory, what
e causes abnormal memories,
s and how so we can remember
so much.

which is largely centered in the
San Fernando Valley in suburban
Los Angeles, says the requirement
is unnecessary since the industry
already polices itself by requiring
performers to undergo monthly
tests for HIV and other infections.
The industry also says porn
viewers will not watch sex scenes
with condoms, forcing adult film
producers to relocate to where
they can make movies that will
sell.
On Wednesday, the Free
Speech Coalition, a trade group
representing the adult entertain-
ment industry, said it plans to file
a lawsuit to overturn the condom
requirement on constitutional
grounds.
"We believe in the calm, seri-
ous deliberations of the legal sys-
tem, we will find that Measure B
is in fact unconstitutional," Diane
Duke, the coalition's executive
director, said in a statement."The
adult film industry will not just
stand by and let it destroy our
business."
In a letter sent to the county
BoardofSupervisors,theindustry
also requested that it be involved
in discussions as to how the coun-
ty will implement the require-
ments. It will also explore moves
to neighboring states as soon as
possible, the coalition said.
"While the AIDS Healthcare
Foundation has tried to portray
any move of jobs outside of L.A.
County as unrealistic, the hard
truth of the matter is that is exact-
ly what this industry plans on
doing now," said James Lee, com-
munications director for the No
on Government Waste Commit-
tee, which opposed the measure.
Michael Weinstein, president
of the AIDS Healthcare Founda-
tion, said he is not fazed by threats
of a lawsuit or of relocation. The
issue is one of public health and
safety for workers who run a high
risk for sexually transmitted ill-
nesses, he said.
The industry argument did
not convince voters, he said.
"There was a very high degree
of awareness about this proposi-
tion," he said. "Voters were edu-
cated about it."

Former Penn State University President Graham Spanier and his wife Sandra enter Harrisburg, Pa. District Judge William Wenner's office on
Wednesday.
Former Penn State president
arraigned, no plea entere

Spanier released
on bail for charges
related to cover-up
of Sandusky scandal
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -
Former Penn State president
Graham Spanier was arraigned
and released on bail at a brief
court appearance Wednesday on
charges he lied about and con-
cealed child sex abuse allega-
tions involving former assistant
football coach Jerry Sandusky.
Spanier, accompanied by his
wife, signed paperwork after his
bail was set at $125,000, but he
was not required to post any of
that amount. He was ordered to
forfeit his passport and be finger-
printed. He didn't enter a plea.
Afterward, defense attorney
Elizabeth Ainslie told reporters
her client is "not guilty, abso-
lutely" and disputed prosecu-
tors' claims Spanier conspired
with university athletic director
Tim Curley and vice president
Gary Schultz. She said Spanier,
who testified before agrand jury
in the matter, has not been given

the opportunity to present his
side of the story.
"This wasn't a conspiracy of
silence," she said, echoing the
charge made last week by state
Attorney General Linda Kelly.
"That is ridiculous."
Spanier, 64, was charged last
week with perjury, obstruction,
endangering the welfare of chil-
dren, failure to properly report
suspected abuse and conspir-
acy for his actions in response
to complaints about Sandusky
showering with children.
Spanier has claimed he is being
framed for political purposes.
He served as Penn State's
president for 16 years but was
forced out a year ago after San-
dusky was charged along with
Curley and Schultz, who were
two of Spanier's top underlings.
Spanier is on paid leave as a
member of the faculty.
Along with the charges
against Spanier, prosecutors
added counts against Curley and
Schultz. They were arraigned
Thursday. District judge Wil-
liam Wenner told Spanier and
his lawyers the Nov. 16 prelimi-
nary hearing date would likely
be delayed a month or two.

Curley, the athletic director
on leave until the final year of
his contract expires, and Schul-
tz, now retired, await trial early
next year on charges of failure to
report suspected abuse and per-
jury. Like Spanier, they deny the
allegations.
On Monday, state prosecutors
filed paperwork telling the judge
in the earlier Curley and Schultz
case they did not object to their
request to delay the planned Jan.
7 start of that trial. The attorney
general's office said it would seek
to combine those charges, the
new charges, and Spanier's case.
The latest charges came
almost exactly a year after
details of the case against San-
dusky sent a maelstrom through
State College, toppling long-
time head coach Joe Paterno
and eventually leading to severe
NCAA sanctions against the
football team.
Sandusky, 68, vigorously
contested the charges but was
convicted in June of 45 counts
of abuse of boys, including vio-
lent sexual attacks inside cam-
pus facilities. He was sentenced
last month to 30 to 60 years in
prison.

NEW YORK
New storm bears
down on NYC, NJ
A nor'easter blustered into
New York and New Jersey on
Wednesday with rain and wet
snow, plunging homes right back
into darkness, stopping commuter
trains again, and inflicting anoth-
er round of misery on thousands
of people still reeling from Super-
storm Sandy's blow more than a
week ago.
Under ordinary circumstanc-
es, a storm of this sort wouldn't
be a big deal, but large swaths of
the landscape were still an open
wound, with the electrical system
highly fragile and many of Sandy's
victims still mucking out. their
homes and cars and shivering in
the deepening cold.
Exactly as authorities feared,
the nor'easter brought down tree
limbs and electrical wires, and
utilities in New York and New Jer-
sey reported that some customers
who lost power because of Sandy
lost it all over again as a result of
the nor'easter.

The California man behind

tion by lying about his identity.
U.S. District Court Judge

after he admitted to four of the
eight alleged violations, includ-
ing obtaining a fraudulent
California driver's license. Pros-
ecutors agreed to drop the other
four allegations under an agree-
ment with Youssef's attorneys,
which also included more proba-
tion.
None of the violations had to
do with the content of "Inno-

depicts Mohammad as a reli-

anizer.

Top Egyptian
prosecutor bans
online porn
Egypt's top prosecutor
ordered government ministries
on Wednesday to enforce a ban
on pornographic websites, three
years after a court denounced the
sites as "venomous and vile."
An official in the prosecutor's
office said the order followed
a protest Wednesday by ultra-
conservative Muslims known as
Salafis, who have launched a cam-
paign called "Pure Net" to pro-
hibit the pornographic websites.
The official spoke on condition
of anonymity because he was not
authorized to speak to reporters.
In the past, though, similar
orders were not enforced because
of high costs associated with tech-
nical applications in blocking the
thousands of websites and their
various pages.

Election causes
concern for future
of world economy
LONDON (AP) - Stock mar-
kets plunged Wednesday on
concerns that newly re-elected
President Barack Obama will
struggle to agree on a budget deal
with a divided Congress and as
Europe's economic outlook dark-
ened further.
The ease with which Obama
secured four more years in the
White House - avoiding the
uncertainty of ballot recounts,
as in 2000 - had buoyed mar-
kets early in the day. But as the
day wore on, investors grew con-
cerned over the implications of a
still divided Congress.
Though the Democrats main-
tained the presidency and their
majority in the Senate, the Repub-
licans remain in command in the
House of Representatives. That
could lead to a logjam in policy-
making, not least over the par-
lous state of the country's public
finances.
The most pressing matter fac-
ing the U.S. government is the
so-called "fiscal cliff" - a com-
bination of higher taxes and
government spending cuts that
automatically take effect unless
Congress agrees on a new budget
by Jan. 1. Economists warn that a
failure to reach a concrete deci-
sion will push the world's largest
economy back into recession.
"The initially favorable reac-
tion has evaporated with the ugly
task of dealing with the fiscal cliff
eclipsing earlier optimism," said
Andrew Wilkinson, chief econom-
ic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co.
U.S. stocks opened lower and
kept falling throughout the morn-
ing in New York. The Dow Jones
industrial average was down 2.5
percent at 12,918.23 and the broad-
er S&P 500 index off the same rate
at 1,392.99.
In Europe, the FTSE 100 index
of leading British shares dropped
1.6 percent to close at 5,791.63
while Germany's DAX fell 2 per-

economy to full health.
While the impending "fiscal
cliff" dominates the postelec-
tion agenda, the president and
Republicans have other con-
cerns, too.
Obama is looking ahead to
top-level personnel changes in
a second term, involving three
powerful Cabinet portfolios at
a minimum.
And Republicans are head-
ing into a season of potentially
painful reflection after los-
ing the presidency in an econ-
omy that might have proved
Obama's political undoing.
They also have fallen deeper
into the Senate minority after
the second election in a row
in which they lost potentially
winnable races by fielding can-
didates with views that voters
evidently judged too extreme.
One major topic for GOP dis-
cussion: the changing face of
America.
"We've got to deal with the
issue of immigration through
good policy. What is the right

policy if we want economic
growth in America as it relates
to immigration?" said former
Republican Party Chairman
Haley Barbour. Obama drew
support from about 70 percent
of all Hispanics. That far out-
paced Romney, who :said dur-
ing the Republican primaries
that illegal immigrants should
self-deport, then spent the gen-
eral election campaign trying
to move toward the political
middle on the issue.
The maneuvering on the
economy - the dominant issue
by far in the campaign - began
even before Obama returned
to the White House from his
home town of Chicago.
After securing a second
term, the president is com-
mitted to bipartisan solutions
"to reduce our deficit in a bal-
anced way, cut taxes for middle
class families and small busi-
nesses and create jobs," and he

House said.

cent to 7,232.83. The CAC-40
in France dropped 2 percent to

Sentiment has also been hit by
a downbeat set of European eco-
nomic forecasts from the Euro-
pean Commission. The executive
arm of the European Union now
expects the 17-country eurozone
to contract by0.4 percent this year
and to grow by only 0.1 percent
next year.
Figures showing that Ger-
many, Europe's largest economy,
saw industrial production in
September fell by 1.8 percent,
worse than market expectations
for minus 0.6 percent, also hurt
sentiment.
The turnaround in stocks mar-
kets was evident in currencies,
too- when risk appetite wanes,
the dollar usually finds support.
By late afternoon London time,
the euro was 0.4 percent lower
at $1.2762, a full cent lower than
where it had been trading earlier.
Investors are also turning
their attention toward a crucial
vote in the Greek Parliament
later in the day. If lawmakers
don't back a 13.5 billion ($17.3
billion) package of spending
cuts and tax increases, the coun-
try faces the prospect of los-
ing access to its bailout lifeline
and potentially defaulting on its
mountain of debt and leaving the
euro.
That toxic combination could
have massive negative reper-
cussions in financial markets,
regardless of whether a biparti-
san budget solution is reached in
the U.S. in the coming weeks.
"Strange to think that over
100 million votes cast in the U.S.
may have less impact upon the
markets over the next month or
so than some 300 votes due to
be cast in the Greek parliament
this evening," said Gary Jenkins,

39 dead after strong Legalization of pot in two
quake in Guatemala states challenges drug war

Hundreds more
reported injured or
missing in 22 states
SAN MARCOS, Guatemala
(AP) - A 7.4-magnitude earth-
quake rocked Guatemala on
Wednesday, killing at least 39
people as it toppled thick adobe
walls, shook huge landslides
down onto highways, and sent
terrified villagers streaming into
the streets of this .idyllic moun-
tain town near the border with
Mexico. One hundred people
were missing, and hundreds were
injured.
The quake, which hit at 10:35
a.m. in the midst of the work day,
caused terror over an unusually
wide area, with damage reported
in all but one of Guatemala's 22
states and shaking felt as far away
as Mexico City, 600 miles to the
northwest.
San Marcos, where more than
30 homes collapsed, bore the
brunt of the temblor's fury.
More than 300 people, includ-
ing firefighters, policemen and
villagers, tried to dig through a
half ton of sand at a quarry in the
commercial center of town in a
desperate attempt to rescue seven
people believed buried alive.
Among those under the sand was
a 6-year-old boy who had accom-
panied his grandfather to work.
"I want to see Giovanni! I
want to see Giovanni!" the boy's
mother, 42-year-old Francisca
Ramirez, frantically cried. "He's
not dead. Get him out." She said
the boy's father had emigrated to
the U.S. and there was no way to
reach him.
President Otto Perez Molina
flew to San Marcos to view the
damage. He said the death toll
stood at 39, most of it in this lush
mountainous region of 50,000

indigenous farmers and ranchers,
many belonging to the Mam eth-
nic group.
"One thing is to hear about
what happened and another
thing entirely is to see it," Perez
told The Associated Press. "As
a Guatemalan I feel sad ... to see
mothers crying for their lost chil-
dren."
The president said the govern-
ment would pay for the funerals
of all victims in the poor region.
Many of the colorful adobe
buildings in the 10-square-mile
center of San Marcos were either
cracked or reduced to rubble,
including the police station and
the courthouse. The temblor left
a large gash in one of the streets,
and hundreds of frightened vil-
lagers stood in the open, refusing
to go back inside.
Hundreds of people crammed
into the hallways of the small
town hospitalwaitingfor medical
staff to help injured family mem-
bers, some complainingtheywere
not getting care quickly enough.
Ingrid Lopez, who went to the
hospital with a 72-year-old aunt
whose legs were crushed by a
falling wall, said she had waited
hours for an X-ray.
"We ask the president to
improve conditions at the hospi-
tal," she said. "There isn't enough
staff."
The quake, which was 20 miles
deep, was centered 15 miles off
the coastal town of Champerico
and 100 miles southwest of Gua-
temala City. It was the strongest
earthquake to hit Guatemala
since a 1976 temblor that killed
23,000.
Officials said most of 100
missing were from San Marcos,
which is surrounded by lush
mountains. The mainly indige-
nous inhabitants farm corn and
heard cattle, mostly for their
own survival.

Colorado and
Washington to
allow recreatioinal
marijuana use
DENVER (AP) - First came
marijuana as medicine. Now
comes legal pot for the people.
Those who have argued for,
decades that legalizing and
taxing weed would be better
than a costly, failed U.S. drug
war have their chance to prove
it, as Colorado and Washington
became the first states to allow
pot for recreational use.
While the measures earned
support from broad swaths of
the electorate in both states
Tuesday, they are likely to face
resistance from federal drug
warriors. As of Wednesday,
authorities did not say whether
they would challenge the new
laws.
Pot advocates say a fight is
exactly what they want.
"I think we are at a tipping
point on marijuana policy,"
said Brian Vicente, co-author of
Colorado's marijuana measure.
"We are going to see whether
marijuana prohibition survives,
or whether we should try a new
and more sensible approach."
Soon after the measures
passed, cheering people poured
out of bars in Denver, the tangy
scent of pot filling the air, and
others in Seattle lit up in cel-
ebration.
Authorities in Colorado,
however, urged caution. "Fed-
eral law still says marijuana is
an illegal drug, so don't break
out the Cheetos or Goldfish
too quickly," said Democratic
Gov. John Hickenlooper, who
opposed the measure.

Bittersweet freedom
Shirvell should receive unemployment benefits
Following a ruling by Lansing judge Paula Manderfield, for-
mer Michigan Assistant Attorney General Andrew Shirvell
will be allowed to collect unemployment benefits in the wake
of his termination by the state. Earlier this year, the Michigan Civil
Service Commission decided to dismiss Shirvell due to "harassing
conduct" including "reprehensible speech, lies and half-truths"
published on his online blog, "Chris Armstrong Watch." Shirvell
created the blog in 2010 in response to the election of Chris Arm-
strong, the first openly gay president of the University's student gov-
ernment then called Michigan Student Assembly. The blog attacked
Armstrong for pushing a "radical homosexual agenda."

Federal law still says marijuana is an
illegal drug, so don't break out the
Cheetos or Goldfish too quickly."
- Gov. John Hickenlooper (D-Col.) said in response to Colorado's
legalization of recreational marijuana on Wednesday.
The calm after the storm

Although Shirvell's words and actions may
be utterly disgraceful and morally reprehen-
sible, they're protected under the U.S. Con-
stitution's First Amendment and as a result,
legal. Therefore, Paula Judge Manderfield's
decision to award Shirvell unemployment
benefits was justified.
Shirvell's blog accuses Armstrong of pro-
moting "gay 'marriage' rights and 'adoption'
rights." It has also included a picture of Arm-
strong behind a rainbow flag and swastika.
Shirvell has even appeared on a short television
spot, during which he said Armstrong was "act-
ing like a gay Nazi." After Shirvell refused to
retract his statements, Armstrong filed a defa-
mation lawsuit in 2011. A federal jury in Detroit
found Shirvell guilty and ordered him to pay
Armstrong $4.5 million in damages. During the
litigation, Shirvell was fired from his position
as assistant attorney general due to his "harass-
ing conduct" that "made a media spectacle of
himself and the Department of the Attorney
General." Shirvell then applied for unemploy-
ment benefits, but was denied. Judge Mander-
field overturned that decision, explaining that
Shirvell "was fired for constitutionally protect-
ed speech" rather than misconduct.
The Michigan Unemployment Insurance
Agency states that unemployment benefits are
"intended to provide temporary income as you
seek new employment." Still, there are restric-

tions to who can receive them. The Michigan
Employment Security Act asserts that a person
cannot receive unemployment benefits if they
were "suspended or discharged for misconduct
connected with the individual's work..." Michi-
gan defines misconduct as "willful and wanton
disregard of the employer's interest, or of the
employer's reasonable standards of behavior
... the actions of the worker must show gross
negligence." However, the state also says, "the
mere inability to do the job, or good-faith errors
in judgment, is not considered misconduct in an
unemployment compensation case."
The dismissal of Shirvell as assistant attor-
ney general was sensible, as his behavior was
outrageously offensive and was founded on
baseless prejudice. Nevertheless, Shirvell was
legally allowed to express and defend his per-
sonal beliefs. Thus, Shirvell reasonably believed
that what he was doing was legal, and from his
point of view, moral.
This does not qualify as "willful and won-
ton disregard," but rather a "good-faith error
in judgment." Even if calling a student a "gay
Nazi" on television is grossly unethical, it's not
illegal. As a community, the University should
remember that everyone, especially those we
disagree with, must be treated fairly and justly.
If we're unwilling to protect the rights of those
we disagree with, we have no grounds to expect
protection of our own rights.

n the earlier parts of the
now-concluded 2012 presi-
dential campaign, Democrats
and Republi-
cans expressed
a desire to
resolve issues
of extreme par-
tisanship. Each
group promised

tively with the SA H
other to achieve
common goals. ROHAN
Whereas most
political ambi-
tions tend to fall by the wayside,
this particular desire for -biparti-
san politics has actually material-
ized. With the tumult of Hurricane
Sandy, Americans can finally bear
witness to the political aspiration
of true bipartisanship, even if it's a
short-lived one.
Back in September, during the
Democratic National Convention,
former President Bill Clinton spent
a large part of his charge calling
for a return to the days of political
cooperation. Clinton noted, almost
prophetically, "I have been honored
to work with both presidents Bush
on natural disasters in the after-
math of the South Asian tsunami,
Hurricane Katrina, and the hor-
rible earthquake in Haiti."
From Clinton's specific exam-
ples, we see that it's precisely in
times of devastating crises that
party divisions give way to the basic
needs of human beings, which have
little to do with everyday politics.
What we witnessed these last two
weeks in the aftermath of Hurri-
cane Sandy certainly seems to sup-
port that idea.
With Sandy leaving hundreds of
thousands without power or run-
ning water across the Northeast,
President Barack Obama promptly
extended federal aid to affected
areas. Furthermore, he maintained
frequent personal contact with the
leaders of affected states, such as

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie
- who has been a vocal critic of
the president throughout the cam-
paign. Obama's swift and effective
actions inspired the Republican
politician and staunch Mitt Rom-
ney supporter to openly praise the
President's apt response.
"The fact ofthe matter is that if the
president of the United States comes
here and he is willing to help my
people, andthe does it, then I'm going
to say nice things about him because
he's earned it," said Christie.
Such extolment comes after
Christie likened Obama to "a man
wandering around a dark room,
hands up against the wall, clutch-
ing for the light switch of leader-
ship" when he spoke at a Romney
campaign event in Richmond, Va.
not two weeks prior to the storm.
In addition to Christie's unan-
ticipated praise, Obama received
the public endorsement of New York
City's Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg,
an independent, who has, in the
aftermath of Sandy, put environ-
mental concerns at the forefront of
his own political interests. "We need
leadership from the White House -
and over the past four years, Presi-
dent Barack Obama has taken major
steps to reduce our carbon consump-
tion," Bloomberg wrote in a recent
editorial. Bloomberg's endorsement
is another concrete example where
the desire to achieve a common good
in the aftermath of disaster, tran-
scends political polarity.
In recent years, political coop-
eration has become the exception to
the rule. Bitter disagieements along
party lines often dominate political
action and discourse. However, from
the devastation of Hurricane Sandy,
there emerged a rainbow of hope for
cooperation to quell the ever-increas-
ing polarization of the parties.
While this single instance of
political response surrounding
Hurricane Sandy offers proof that
bipartisanship is not an impossible
dream, its endurance as an every-

day practice is unlikely. Soon, the
wreckage of the storm will clear
and America will forget how coop-
eration helped to resolve a catastro-
phe.

unexpected, that political coop-
eration in our day emerges only in
times of intense duress. However,
such times remind us that, at the
end of the day, we're all just people.
In the face of imminent danger, we
cease being Republicans, Demo-
crats or Independents. Political
affiliation is superfluous when deal-
ing with issues that must quickly
and efficiently be resolved.
Now that the results of the 2012
presidential election are in, Obama
has another chance to heed the
calls of political cooperation Clin-
ton spoke about at the convention.
"When times are tough and peo-
ple are frustrated and angry and
hurting and uncertain, the politics
of constant conflict may be good,"
Clinton said. "But what is good pol-
itics does not necessarily work in
the real world. What works in the
real world is cooperation."
The recent response to the crisis
of Hurricane Sandy has proven that
cooperation between different par-
ties is possible and effective. If we
could only find a wayto achieve such
harmony in the face of the everyday
and not wait until we are impelled
by devastating circumstances, we'd
be in much better shape.

Coulda, woulda, shoulda

What do you want to be when you
grow up? I'm sitting in my kinder-
garten classroom as Ms. Thurm asks
me this question. It's not so difficult
- Jedi are pretty awesome, I fig-
ure, why not just do that? Saving the
world from your Dad's evil empire
andgettingthe girl inthe end doesn't
sound like too bad of a future.
Back then, it was a simple ques-
tion. One that could be answered
without worrying about recessions
or responsibilities or raging hor-
mones or reading quizzes.
I'd like to think I've grown
slightly wiser in my (comparative-
ly) old age, so why is that question
so much harder now?
"What do you want to be?" has
since evolved into, "what could I
be?" and then even further into,
"what should I be?"
Let's start with the former: noth-
ing has made "what I could be" more
clear than the college admissions
process. It's a time of stress, emo-
tional breakdowns and, maybe most
importantly, evaluations. There are
few processes that are as intense-
ly evaluative as having complete
strangers take a look at your life,
using only three recommendations,
three scored test sections and three
essays.
The entire process on both sides
is based on what could; "could you
see yourself there ... could you live
'x' miles from home ... could you
find someone and something here
to love ..." On the other side, it looks
like "could he excel in our classes ...
could he represent our school the

way we'd like ... could he contrib-
ute to the academic, intellectual
and social diversity in our commu-
nity ..." Between the time when the
Common Application is submitted
and when those oh-so-looked-for-
ward-to admissions decisions start
coming in, it's made pretty clear
what you could be.
"What should I be" is a harder
question. That "should" is more
subjective - it's up to us. We can
study what we please, we can
identify with what we please, and
we can say what we please, as we
please. That, in the end, should be
the blessing of college.
But the "should" is likely influ-
enced in many subtle ways: the eco-
nomic should, what we need to do
outside of class to make sure we can
stay in class; the social should, what
activities outside of school make
sure we can bear staying in school;
the academic should, what we need
to do inside class to make sure we
move forward. And that's a lot to
think about.
We've looked at the "want" of that
impossibly difficult question, maybe
we oughtto look at the "to be." In the
words of Thomas Merton, it's "not
what we do, but how we do it." He
believed that being is established in
action, not by results - bythe means,
not the end. In that sense, "work" is
becoming of an individual - it's by
the way he interacts with the world
that he discovers who he is. And, in a
world of industry, "work" is the pri-
mary obligation of the individual to
society. But more important than the

work he does is how he does it.
Benjamin Zander establishes two
criteria for this "how": work ought
to bring one to love and allow one to
play. That's an interesting theory in
a world where we struggle through
the academic week toward the free-
dom of the Friday night.
The missing piece in all of this
is a simple one - the concept that
"working is playing." So, "What do
you want to be" refers exclusively
to Monday morning through Friday
afternoon. That's probably why we
have so much trouble answering
the question. Believing that what
we can do refers to a completely
different set of criteria than what
we should do, that the "can" refers
to the weekend and the "should" to
the week, has separated our pas-
sions from our ambitions.
We've all grown up (at least
slightly) since we've been asked
that questions. It's no longer what
do you want to be when you grow
up. Now the question is: are you
what you want to be now that
you've grown up?
I believe we would have a much
less negative experience answer-
ing the first question if we could
respond positively to the second.
Forget "working hard" in order to
"play hard." Work, at this point in
our lives, should be playing - doing
what we could love for another 70
years or so. That's the blessing of
college. We aren't what we get, but
how we get it. Get it?

as a regent," Bernstein said. "I am
eager to begin to serve the Uni-
versity and the people of Michi-
gan."
Bernstein holds a bachelor's
degree, a law degree and an MBA
from the University and is cur-
rently the president of the Sam
Bernstein Law Firm, his father's
legal practice. He previously
worked on the Clinton admin-
istration and was appointed by
former Democratic Gov. Jennifer
Granholm to sit on the Michigan
Civil Rights Commission.
Bernstein attributed his elec-
toral success to an unortho-
dox campaign for the position,
including a bus tour of the state
to raise awareness about the
election.
"We ignored every piece of
conventional wisdom that was
imparted upon us," Bernstein
said. "We campaigned in a way
that I felt honored the extraor-
dinarily important role that the
University of Michigan plays in
our state, and the important role
in leading the University."
During his well-publicized
campaign, Bernstein consistent-
ly advocated for lowered under-

graduate tuition, the creation of
"Go Blue Bonds" to provide stu-
dents with access to lower interest
rate loans and the reallocation of
some portion of the University's
endowment to financial aid.
"The most important prior-
ity that faces higher education is
addressing skyrocketing tuition
and the burden of crushing stu-
dent debt," Bernstein said.
He added that in the long
term, he saw a coming divide
among public universities
between those who could adjust
to the new reality of funding for
public education and those who
could not.
"We are in a transformative
moment in'higher education and
there will be public universities
that will figure this out," Bern-
stein said. "There will be win-.
ners and losers. The losers will
be left behind and so will the
states in which they are located
... the stakes could not be higher."
Diggs, who holds undergradu-
ate and medical degrees from
the University, is currently the
owner of a laser and cosmetic
dermatology practice in Grosse
Pointe Farms. Inan Oct. 27 inter-
view with The Michigan Daily,
Diggs echoed Bernstein's assess-
ment that tuition and affordabil-
ity are the most pressing issue

facing the University and the
Board of Regents.
"I think there are ways to
make U of M just as financially
attractive as other institutions
around the country," Diggs said.
"I do think that the regents and
the administration ... could have
a leadership role in trying to
encourage the Legislature to
continue to pay appropriations
(to the) University."
Diggs could not be reached for
comment on Wednesday.
One of the Republican regent
nominees, Robert Steele, spoke
several hours before returns
came in and said the down-ticket
races would almost certainly fol-
low the trend set by higher races.
"The regents or any of the
State Board of Education-type
races are at the bottom of the
ballot and follow the top of the
ballot," Steele said. "If Obama
wins, I probably won't, if Rom-
ney wins, I probably will."
Steele, who ran unsuccessful-
ly against U.S. Rep. John Dingellt
(D-Mich.) in 2010, said he did
not have any plans to run for
office in the future.
Dan Horning, the other
Republican regent nominee, who
previously served as regent from
1995-2002, was not immediately
available for comment.

ly hard and I'm happy that hard
work pays off, since that's what I
teach my kids every day," McCor-
mack said. "I received 10 out of
10 newspaper endorsements and
really worked hard to develop
relationships around the state to
make sure people understood that
I was committed to having a court
where politics didn't play a role
and everyone got a fair shake and I
think my message resonated."
McCormack's campaign
included a lengthy shout-out in a

political advertisement featuring
the cast of "The West Wing." In
the YouTube ad, the cast encour-
ages Michigan voters to fill out
the nonpartisan ballot, mention-
ing' that McCormack is on, the
ticket. They discussed McCor-
mack's platform to bring integrity
and fairness for ordinary people
to the court.
McCormack's sister, Mary,
starred in the last three seasons
of the show, and helped secure
the mention. A video of the ad
posted on YouTube by McCor-
mack has received more than 1
million views. McCormack also
appeared on the E! show "Chel-

sea Lately" in October to discuss
wrongful convictions with host
Chelsea Handler.
McCormack has been a law
professor at the University'since
1998. She serves as the associ-
ate dean for clinical affairs and
founded the Michigan Inno-
cence Clinic in 2009, a group
thai works in Michigan courts
to exonerate wrongfully accused
individuals using non-DNA evi-
dence.
McCormack will have to
resign from her work at the Uni-
versity when she begins her posi-
tion in the Michigan Supreme
Court to remain impartial.



RACE
From Page 1A
Harris said shewas approached
by a high school teacher from the
area who suggested bringing the
exhibit to the University so her
students could be exposed to
learning more about race issues.
"What's great about it is that it
gives people all kinds of ways to
start talking," Harris said.
Harris said the three primary
themes in the exhibit are science,
history and lived experiences. To
supplement the visiting exhibit,
the museum will also be incor-
porating a self-developed gallery,
"Race in This Place: A Communi-
ty Conversation," which will open
on Nov. 16.
The gallery seeks to address
issues revolving around race in
health, immigration, the educa-
tion system and the legal system.
It includes video, art and inter-
views with citizens about race in
Washtenaw County, according to
the Museum of Natural History's
website.
"We recognize that it is a
national focus," Harris said. "We
wanted to incorporate into peo-
ple's experience a look at what's
going on in our local community
around race ... The focus is to
identify what the issues are but
more importantly who is working
on trying to make things better."
A condensed version of the
exhibit will be brought to the'
University to accommodate the
space limitations at the museum.
However, Harris said nothinghas
been removed in the process of
condensingit.
The Understanding Race Proj-
ect faculty at the Museum of
Natural History trace student
perception on race throughout
the exhibit to see how their views
have been impacted and examine
how people have formed relation-
ships.
Involvement in the Under-
standing Race Project goes

beyond the LSA theme semes-
ter and includes a wide range of
community involvement among
Washtenaw County's 10 school
districts, the Ann Arbor District
Library and the Ypsilanti District
Library. Harris said community
efforts have been underway since
January 2012.
"The purpose of it is to stimu-
late a national conversation about
race," Harris said. "It's been so
successful and popular ... Our
vision for this exhibit is to use it as
an opportunity to encourage con-
versations about race not only on
campus but also in the Ann Arbor
and Washtenaw County commu-
nity and in the schools."
She added: "I hope that every
student at the University of Mich-
igan will see the exhibit. I hope
that they will take part in some of
'the amazing programs that they
are liningup."
Education graduate student
Clara Ng-Quinn, an Understand-
ing Race Theme Semester gradu-
ate intern and an Understanding
Race Student Steering Committee
adviser, said 133 courses in the
LSA Winter 2013 semester will
incorporate race and relate the
theme to a variety of topics.
"The ultimate goal of the
steering committee is to engage
as many students as possible in
this theme of understanding race
through big events, through small
events, through discussions,
bringing speakers in, bringing
performances in," Ng-Quinn said.
She would not release specific
details for events because they
are still in the planning stages
and there areno definite details
yet. However, she did say there
will be three to four major events
that will relate to a wide variety
of audience members in addition
to smaller niche events and col-
laboration with cultural student
organizations.
The steering committee is ana-
lyzing how sexuality, class and
gender relate to race. They are
trying to relate those sub-themes

into the courses offered as part
of the winter 2013 semester. Ng-
Quinn said though some subjects
obviously relate to race, other
topics, such as women's studies,
will incorporate aspects of race
through their relative topics, such
as gender and class.
"My hope, at least, is that this
theme semester will provide
opportunities for students to
engage in discussions about race
in a positive environment and to
hopefully chip away that stigma
about talking about race," Ng-
Quinn said. "I really think that
race is something-that is useful to
talk about; it doesn't matter what
race you are."
Ng-Quinn said any student
interested in joining the collabo-
ration effort is welcome to join
the student steeringcommittee.
Noel Gordon, an LSA senior
and student steering committee
member, said the committee is
looking to incorporate race into
various aspects of student life,
from medicine to sports to art.
"One of the things that I would
like to achieve is to really make
issues of race salient to people
as they sort of understand it,"
Gordon said. "It's equally impor-
tant to make sure students find
conversations about race very
accessible to them and relevant to
them."
Gordon said students might
refrain from having conversa-
tions about race in fear of saying
something wrong or offensive,
and promoting open dialogue is
important to removingstigmas.
"If we don't have these coh-
versations in sort of genuine and
authentic ways, while admitting
that some people will probably
say the wrong thing in the pro-
cess, then no one's ever going to
learn anything," Gordon said.
"It's important for me ... to help
students understand that it's okay
to make mistakes while talking
about race because that's the only
way we're ever going to get to a
better understanding."

BIKE WEEK
From Page 1A
Fund last fall, which will distrib-
ute $150,000 over a three-year
period to large-scale sustain-
ability projects, including biking
programs.
In 2011, Coleman announced
$50,000 of the fund was to be
used for the Bike Air Pumps and
Fix-it Station, the Reusable Con-
tainers Program, the Sustainable
Food Kiosk and the University
Campus Farm.
Arielle Fleisher, a Public
Health graduate student and
bike project leader, said she
came up with the idea for Bike
Week after she injured herself
on a beam on the repair station
shortly after it was installed
and wanted to educate students
about their use..
She added that Bike Week
should help students and Ann
Arbor residents use the installa-
tions properly.
"We don't want to just put
(station tools) on the ground and
walk away," Fleisher said. "The
goal is to get people to really use
these products and to use them
well. They only are as good as
they are used."
On Tuesday, the- Univer-
sity-held a bicycle resource fair
called Bike Fest at the Central
Campus Transport Station. Stu-

dent ambassadors at the event
helped explain how to use the
new stations ind throughout the
week more than 50 bike ambas-
sadors will take shifts explaining
their uses to passersby.
Fleisher said she hopes Bike
Week will not only inform stu-
dents on howr to use the new
installations, but also inspire
them to advocate for other
causes they believe in.
"This is your campus, and you
can make changes on it and advo-
cate things if you keep it going,"
Fleisher said. "If you really keep
the momentum going, this is a
great way to get things done."
University alum Andrew
Bradburn volunteered to be a
bike ambassador after moving
back to Ann Arbor recently. He
said he hopes the bike ambas-
sadors will help students learn
how to use the bike repair tools
and pumps.
"People are seeing the sta-
tions, interested in them, and
will touch the tools, but they
don't really know how to work
it," Bradburn said. "Just by being
out here and volunteering our
time to help fix bikes, pump tires
and just be around the pumps
will help. So when people swing
by and ask questions, we will
hopefully inform them how to
use these stations properly."
LSA senior Lauren Beriont,
a fellow bike ambassador, said

the project also promotes a bike-
friendly campus.
"It's just to get people outside
and make it easier for people to
pump their tires by letting them
know that all these resources
are around now," Beriont said. "I
think it's bringing a lot of people
excitement."
Social work student Braden
Latham-Jones, another bike
ambassador, said he believes Bike
Week will become an annual
event.
"I think we're looking to host
something that's annual, that's
regular, and that raises aware-
ness about biking in general and
commuting by bike as an oppor-
tunity so that bike-friendly
campuses can be built," Latham-
Jones said. "It's a part of a broad-
er idea of encouraging bikers as
opposed to cars as a means of
transportation."
Natural Resources and Envi-
ronment graduate student Ryan
Gourley went to the repair sta-
tion at the C.C. Little bus stop
after encountering difficulties
with his bike's gears. With the
help of Bradburn, Gourley's bike
was up and running within a few
minutes.
"It's great to have these stands
here, and it's really great this
week to have them manned with
experts who can help you out and
show you what you need to do,"
Gourley said.


MATISYAHU
From Page 1A
"I would just say it was more
of a slower process than I just
woke up and decided that," he
said in a phone interview with
the Michigan Daily.
Matis, as he's commonly
called, grew up in New York
in a Reconstructionist Jewish
family. As a teenager, he chal-
lenged his religious beliefs,
and went on the road follow-
ing Phish around the country.
In 1995, however, he attended
a program in Israel where he
explored his heritage and ulti-
mately found his Jewish identi-
ty. His time in Israel led him to
the more observant Orthodox
Judaism, which he practiced
until his decision to step away
in December.
Matisyahu's first three

plan (to work only with one pro-
ducer), but we started working
together and we would write
songs whenever I was in LA,
and then we had about half the
record finished" Matisyahu
said. "So, we decided we'd go to
Israel to work on it some more,
and at that point we realized
we would have a whole record
together."
While Matisyahu's music is
known throughout the world
- you probably know his song
"One Day" through NBC's
promotion of the 2012 Sum-
mer Olympics - he tends to
be pigeonholed publically as
the Hassidic reggae singer. In
Matis's mind, however, this was
never the case.
"(Being typecast) never real-
ly crossed my mind" he said.
"Everything I've done, you
know, the decisions I've made
in my life about my religion,

my ideology, my philosophy ...
the things that I think, the way
I represent myself to the world
- all of that comes from within.
All of that comes from what I
believe to be true."
"We don't need to become
famous or become successful,"
Matisyahu added. "People know-
who you are, you don't stop
living life from the inside ... it
always comes from the inside
out."
Matis revealed plans for an
acoustic album of songs "that
maybe are a bit more personal,"
and a new, reggae-feel record-
with his band. He also kicked
off a two-month college tour in
October, to "play some of the
smaller towns, play for the kids
and what not," and will stop
to play a show Thursday at the
Blind Pig.
He added: "I'll bring my win-
ter coat."

Murphy transitions well from England to A2

By RYAN KRASNOO
For the Daily
When we enter a coffee shop on
South State Street, no one recog-
nizes him.
He picks an open table near
the windows on the left and sits
down, rubbing his hands together
for warmth. Asked if he wants to
order something, he shakes his
head. He's not a big coffee drinker.
On the walk over, we talk for 10
minutes before the interview even
starts. At this moment, we could
be classmates working together
on a project, or roommates relax-
ing on a Sunday afternoon or high
school friends catchingup.
Walking around Ann Arbor,
dressed in a gray pullover sweat-
shirt, navy blue athletic pants,
and blue and white adidas shoes,
James Murphy looks like a typical
American college student.
You couldn't guess he's 4,000
miles fromhome.
Witney, England is a small
town on the River Windrush, 12
miles west of Oxford and a little
more than an hour northwest of
London.
This is where Murphy, a fresh-
man standout on the Michigan
men's soccer team, calls home.
"Outside of my family, I miss
the countryside and being able to
walk down by the river the most,"
Murphy said. "Not being able to
see my family for months on end
is very hard, and I miss the home
comforts that everyone has."
Growing up in soccer-crazed
England, one of those comforts
was developed at an early age. A
rite of passage for many young
English boys, "the beautiful
game" soon became much, much
more to him.
Murphy, his brother and his
father would sitontheir sofa every
Saturday and Sunday watching
matches. He started playing when
he was 5 - by 8, he was playing
six-a-side tournaments and was
hooked.
At 11 years old, with just one
year of local soccer under his
belt, Murphy signed with Oxford
United's youth academy and spent
three years there before trans-
ferring to Reading FC, where

he spent the last five years of his
young career. -
Things only took off from
there. Murphy - whose mother is
of Irish decent - made his inter-
national debut at just 15 years old,
when he suited up for the Under-
16 Irish National Team against
Israel in January 2010. He would
later score his first goal in an Ire-
land uniform in a match against
Malta.
"I still remember the exact
dates, and it's something I'll
always remember," he said. "Not
many people can say they've
played internationally or scored
an international goal."
Murphy's success caught the
attention of Michigan assistant
coach and England native Tommy
McMenemy. After forming a con-
nection with Murphy and recruit-
ing him against schools like the
University of California-Santa
Barbara and North Carolina,
McMenemy finally got Murphy to
sign on with the Wolverines.
"I've been (to the United States)
a few times before on holiday," he
said. "I've been to Florida. I went
on a soccer tour with Reading to
Charlotte, North Carolina when
I was 15. I always wanted to live
in America when I was younger. I
thought it would be coolto experi-
ence a different way of life and get
out of my comfort zone."
But as he would soon find out,
the journey across the pond is not
always an easy one.
"Oh my God, I'm actually
going."
That was Murphy's reaction
the night before he was scheduled
to arriveinAnn Arbor inJuly. The
end of his summer had snuck up
quickly, and the reality of the situ-
ation had finally caught up with
him.
"It didn't hit me that I was
going to America," Murphy
explained. "It seemed like such a
long way away."
Murphy is quick to reference
how supportive his parents were
in his decision to attend college in
the United States, despite the dis-
tance he was about to travel.
"I probably wouldn't be here if
it wasn't for my mom," Murphy
said. "She made a big effort to

Freshman James Murphy has been a welcome addition at Michigan.

help. I remember a six-hour day
we spent at the U.S. Embassy in
England working on paperwork to
allow me come here. (My parents)
understand what a great oppor-
tunity this is for me and that I
should take it with two hands. It's
not every day you get an opportu-
nity like this."
Murphy is making the most of
it - and then some.
He embodies the term stu-
dent-athlete. On the pitch, he is
a menace for opposing defenses
to handle. He is quick, has a deft
touch on the ball and is always
one step ahead of his opponents,
prompting Michigan coach Chaka
Daley to rave about his incredibly
high soccer IQ.
As impressive as he is athleti-
cally, he is keeping pace, step-for-
step, in the classroom as well. He
even has aspirations of going to
law school.
"Becoming a lawyer has always
been a goal of mine," Murphy said.
"That's part of the reason why I
chose to come to Michigan - to
get an education that would set
me up for that.
"This place speaks for itself.
The balance of academics and
athletics is the best in the U.S."
When Murphy showed up on
campus, he was ready to hold up
his end of the bargain.

Murphy heads down a quiet
hallway in South Quad Residence
Hall, reaches into his pocket and
pulls out his housing card.
"Just so you know, they're
probably playing FIFA in there,"
he says.
They are. Teammates and fel-
low freshmen Zach Hager and
Nick Iacobellis sit on the small
couch pushed back in the middle
of the room.
"We always play FIFA," Mur-
phy says. "It gets very competi-
tive."
Zach and 'Nick nod in agree-
ment over their XBox-360 con-
trollers. The room itself looks like
any other college freshman's. The
walls are littered with flags, ban-
ners and posters. The Union Jack
hangs proudly above the televi-
sion. On the wall above the couch
hangs a poster with a map of the
London Underground rail system.
These are little reminders of
home, but he's also put the effort
in to fit in with his American
teammates.
"I've really gotten into Ameri-
can football," Murphy says. "Zach
has been teaching me the rules.
Tyler (Arnone) got me into sup-
porting the Jets, which has sort
of upset some of the guys on the
team from (the state of) Michi-
gan," he says with a smile.
He's also embraced the culture

of the university as a whole, doing
his best to assimilate outside of
the soccer field.
"A lot of people are very enthu-
siastic here," Murphy adds. "They
support things a lot more than
we do back home. I went to my
first ever American football game
versus Air Force ... and it was
incredible. I've met so many of
the freshmen (football) lads who
live in South Quad with me and
they're really friendly. I try to sup-
port them as much as I can."
But it's always been European
football first. -
Immediately to the left of the
door, there's a single poster next
to his bed with a simple slogan:
"Keep calm and support Chelsea."
When asked aboutwhy he likes
Chelsea, he lets out a little laugh.
"It's always been them," he
says. "I think when I was born my
dad put a Chelsea jersey on me."
The central-London-based
soccer club is one of the most
prestigious, successful and rec-
ognizable teams in the world.
Last May, Chelsea won the UEFA
Champions League tournament
as the best club in all of Europe.
"Growing up, I fell in love with
Gianfranco Zola," Murphy says.
"I've always been a huge admirer
of him. When I got older, it was
(current Chelsea midfielder)
Frank Lampard. I try and play my
natural game, but if I can learn
some things from top players like
him, then that's great and I'll try
to implement them in my game."
Despite contributing just three
goals and an assist thus far, Mur-
phy has played in 17 games this
season and has found his foot-
ing in the starting lineup for a
team eager to make a run in the
Big Ten Tournament. And in the
quarterfinals Wednesday night in
Evanston, Illinois, he stepped up.
With the game level in the 68th
minute, Murphy found the break-
through to give Michigan a 1-0
victory over Wisconsin and vault
the Wolverines into the semifinals
on Friday.
Not coincidentally, in a time of
such transition, more so than he
had ever experienced before in his
life, Murphy has fittingly turned
to soccer to help ease the adjust-

ment.
"I think (soccer) makes you
very driven as a person," Murphy
said. "It's so competitive. It gives
you that winning edge that you
need in life if you want to be suc-
cessful."
His teammates also play a big
role in making sure he feels as
close to home as possible.
"They have helped me and
included me, and living in the
dorms has been a great experi-
ence," Murphy said. "They're not
seeing their families either, so we
try to have a lot of fun together."
Still, part of what makes the
adjustment so difficult, Murphy
said, is not having people around
who have had the same experi-
ences growing up. Notsurprising-
ly, then, Murphy has been doing
his best to reach out to fellow Eng-
lish students.
"Lauren (Thomas), who plays
on the field hockey team, lives
about 20 minutes away from me
back home," Murphy said. "I was
shocked when I first saw that.
It's nice when you come from the
same place and have those inside
jokes that no one else under-
stands."
As we exit the coffee shop and
make our way back down State
Street, Murphy isn't prepared for
the cold. He shoves his hands in
his pockets and slightly zips up
his jacket.
We talk for the next couple of
blocks, and at times it feels like
he's the one conducting the inter-
view. He doesn't speak like an
18-year-old kid.
We discuss Hurricane Sandy
among other things and he
asks, concerned, how my fam-
ily is doing on the East Coast. His
demeanor is mature and focused,
as if our exchange is as important
as a game itself.
We let our conversation stray
away from soccer, but he brings it
back just for a moment.
"Perhaps in the next couple of
years (Michigan) could compete
nationally," Murphy says. "Even
this year, we've proven we can
compete with any team in the
country. It's been up and down,
but we're in the rightplace."
And, most certainly, so is he.

Trey Burke prepared to look
past tumultuous off-season

Thursday, November 8, 2012 - 7A
Hutchins signs
5-year extension

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Trey Burke's roller-coaster
offseason began drawing head-
lines just weeks after the Michi-
gan basketball team was knocked
out of the NCAA Tournament.
First came the reports that he
would forgo the final three years
of college to enter the NBA Draft.
After he decided to return for
another season in Ann Arbor,
the hype machine began swirl-
ing around the basketball pro-
gram. By time fall rolled around,
some experts were slating No.
5 Michigan as a Final Four pick
and Burke was selected as an
Associated Press first-team All-
American.
At some point during that
tumultuous offseason,the sopho-
more made what Michigan coach
John Beilein called "out-of-char-
acter decisions" that Burke "now
regrets." After being suspended
for the Wolverines' exhibition
against Northern Michigan,
Burke was relieved to finally
return to the court in Monday
night's 76-48 exhibition victory
over Saginaw Valley State.
After scoring 16 points and
dishing out eight assists in just
21 minutes of action, Burke -
speaking to the media for the
f first time since the suspension -
expressed his readiness to move
past what he referred to as a "sit-
uation in the summer."
He specifically noted how, as a
team leader, he handled the situ-
ation.
"I obviously apologized about
the situation, but we moved on
from there," Burke said. "I know
that with being a leader comes
responsibility, and I know that
I made a mistake, so like I said,
I apologized to 'the team, they

a different perspective," he said.
"It's going to be pretty hard to
guard us this year as long as we
make the right play.
"I learned we've got options.
Last year, the offense was kind of
stagnant a lot, and though these
are exhibition games ... you can
just tell that (we have a lot of
options)."
With Burke and the rest of the
team anxiously awaiting their
regular-season opener against
Slippery Rock on Friday, Beilein
says to look for new wrinkles in
Michigan's offense because of his
point guard's experience.
"We have been experimenting
more than we have ever experi-
mented," Beilein said. "I think
that whatever you do, offensively
and defensively, when you've got
a point guard back - we had to
take our package down a little bit
last year and expand it and then
we had to take it down for him,
now I think that he understands
more."
Beilein also spoke about hav-
ing more flexibility to make in-

Michigan among
heavyweights in
loaded conference

By ERIN LENNON
DailySports Writer
Technically speaking, every
game is anyone's game to win.
But when it comes to Big Ten
volleyball, the euphemism
couldn't be truer.
The Big Ten is the strongest
conference in the NCAA this
season by a landslide. No. 3 Penn
State - No. 1 until the end of
October - Nebraska, Minne-
sota, Ohio State and Purdue are
ranked among the top-25 in-the
nation. And Penn State, Nebras-
ka and Minnesota represent the
conference in the top-10 poll as
of Nov. 1. Both Michigan and
Illinois have also been ranked at
times this season.
So it only makes sense that
Big Ten teams have taken a lik-
ing to beating up on one another
this season. Even the seemingly
invincible offense of Penn State
was shut down last week by No.
4 Nebraska.
Yet the Fighting Illini, who
nearly stole a game from the
Nittany Lions in five sets, were
swept by the Wolverines in three
sets.
On Friday night, Michigan,
who had also given Penn State
a scare at home, defeated the
Cornhuskers in yet another five-
set thriller.
In this conference, there is no
formula for victory.
"The Big Ten is a great prepa-
ration for the NCAA Tourna-
ment," said junior outside hitter
Lexi Erwin. "We see countless
teams that are amazing, that are
top-ranked teams. Just being
able to be in the conference and
play every single weekend, every
single night, against a team
that's ranked is going to help us
out a lot."
For Michigan (7-7 Big Ten,
19-9 overall), the difference
between a win and a loss in con-
ference play has been like a flip
of a coin.
"We know that the games
that we've lost we could have

played a lot better," said senior
middle blocker Claire McEl-
heny. "Whether we would have
won (those games) or not,I don't
know."
Having taken down Nebraska
and cruised past Iowa in straight
sets, it would appear that the
Wolverines are getting hot at
the right time. This weekend's
results brought a .500 confer-
ence record for Michigan and
momentum heading into the
final six games of the season.
The difference over the last
five games, according to Michi-
gan coach Mark Rosen, has had
nothing to do with physical
strength.
"Confidence is one of those
weird things where you can't
give it to anybody, you have to
earn it," Rosen said.
"You have to be in enough
situations and you have to earn
that right to have that confi-
dence, and I'think this team is
starting to get that."
While both Rosen and his
team insist that nothing about
their game has changed physi-
cally, the stats prove that.Michi-
gan volleyball has hit its stride.
"We're a young team, and
we've known that all year,"
Rosen said. "We haven't used it
as an excuse but it's a reality."
Among the young starters
are freshman libero Tiffany
Morales, middle blocker Krysta-
lyn Goode and sophomore setter
Lexi Dannemiller. Junior out-
side hitter Molly Toon recorded
her career-high 25 kills and
Dannemiller nearly tied her per-
sonal record of 64 assists in the
match versus Nebraska. Young-
er players and upperclassmen
alike have raised the team's kill
percentage and kept errors to a
minimum.
So what's next for the Wolver-
ines?
"Wisconsin," Rosen said. "We
got swept by Wisconsin last year
in their place and here, we got
beaten by them at their place.
We want Wisconsin."

Senior forward Jeff Rohrkemper moonlighted at defenseman last Saturday af ter Michigan dropped to five defensemen on the active roster in Marquette.
Roh rkemper steps Up on'D

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Last weekend, the Michi-
gan hockey team lived out a
nightmare when freshman
defenseman Jacob Trouba was
suspended for a game against
Northern Michigan after lay-
ing a heavy blow that included
contact to the head of a Wildcat
defenseman.
Had the game been at Yost Ice
Arena, the call wouldn't have
been as impactful. But on the
road, with an already depleted
blue line crippled by injuries
and the remaining healthy
defensemen back in Ann Arbor,
it wasn't an ideal situation.
Immediately, questions
swirled about what Michigan
coach Red Berenson would do
to fill the gap on the defense's
third defensive pairing.
Luckily for the 12th-ranked
Wolverines, senior forward Jeff
Rohrkemper's performance put
any pre-game uncertainties to
rest.
Yes, Rohrkemper a forward,
made his debut on the blue line

on Saturday, and even though
Michigan (1-2-1 CCHA, 3-3-1
overall) walked away from the
game with a loss, Berenson took
notice of Rohrkemper's adapt-
ability.
Rohrkemper never really
doubted his ability to transition
to a different position.
"I've played hockey my whole
life and watched , defense-
men (play) forever," he said. "I
thought I could handle it, and I
did alright."
Berenson spoke highly of
Rohrkemper's defensive poten-
tial. In fact, he was so certain
his senior could handle it that
the two didn't even have a con-
versation about the switch
beforehand. Berenson simply
told Rohrkemper his expecta-
tions and asked him just one
question:
"How well can you skate
backward?"
The question was partly a
joke, the hope being that by the
time a player reaches the colle-
giate level, he's mastered Skat-
ing 101.
But there was some serious-

ness to it too, considering that
backward skating is a blue-
liner staple, and that before
last weekend, Rohrkemper had
never played a defensive shift in
his entire hockey career.
Despite that, playing
Rohrkemper on the blue line
wasn't really that difficult of a
decision to make, Berenson said.
"He's got the ingredients (of
a defenseman)," Berenson said.
"He's smart, he passes the puck
well and has good defensive
instincts."
His linemate, junior Kevin
Clare, and the rest of. the for-
wards made a point to take spe-
cial care of Rohrkemper during
his shifts - more attention was
paid to screening, covering
Rohrkemper's blind spots and
playing as defensively as pos-
sible to compensate for his inex-
perience.
But perhaps Rohrkemper's
biggest advantage was °the
offensive know-how he brought
back to the blue line. And now
he can bring new defensive
knowledge back to the forward
corps.

"The main thing I took away
from it was how much forwards
can help defensemen out,"
Rohrkemper said.
"Forwards don't really
understand how hard (playing
defense) is. It really makes you
realize how supporting your
defensemen can be really ben-
eficial."
Rohrkemper still finished
out the game with a minus-one
plus/minus rating, though he
did have a very close look at net.
But more importantly than the
box score, Rohrkemper earned
Berenson's trust to potentially
return to the defense in a pinch.
Rohrkemper joked that
there's no permanent position
change actually in the works,
but in a season in which defen-
semen have been dropping like
flies due to injuries, it's reassur-
ing to have an extra contingency
plan.
"He looked like a defense-
man," Berenson said. "If we
had a guy go down, now I'd feel
really comfortable and so would
he, knowing he can up there and
do that."

ARTS RECOMMENDS
In this feature, Daily Arts writers will give their endorsements
for the arts you need to experience to help you deal with current events.
"The Killing Joke"
For those who think Heath Ledger's portrayal
of The Joker in "The Dark Knight" was too twist-
ed, too over-the-top insane, it's likely that you've
never read "Batman: The Killing Joke," a DC
SMIL / graphic novel written by the visionary Alan Moore
and illustrated by the meticulous Brian Bolland.
The one-shot offers up the most manic, depraved
DC COMICS version of the makeup-laden villain there is.
The Beatles
Face it: The day everyone agrees on politics (and
stops arguing about them on Facebook) is never
going to come. For those who are sick of all the
fighting and want everyone to just be friends, it's
time to look instead to the music front for comfort
- specifically to The Beatles. Unlike the seedy poli-
ticians we voted for on Tuesday, any song or album
by the Liverpool band is something that everyone
can generally getbehind. After all, it's a lot less cool
APPLE to hate The Beatles than it is Mitt Romney.
"Paperman"
"Paperman," an animated short preceding the
film "Wreck-It Ralph," lifts the heart. Every piece
is perfectly weighted, from the mellow build of the
music, to the simplicity and brilliance of the style
of animation, to the resonance of the story. "Paper-
man" tells of half-glances, the means with which
we communicate and the lengths we should go to
find the people we pass by. It truly is love at first
DISNEY sight.
"Chopped"
Like the idea of watching chefs struggle with
zany ingredients a la "Iron Chef," but don't want
a Japanese man enthusiastically munching on
a bell pepper in a three-course competition for
$10,000? "Chopped" might be a better fit for you.
The Food Network's high-stakes, high-drama
show pits everyone from teen chefs to seasoned
pros against ingredients like spam and candy.

"It." The word's haunting sim-
plicity remains lodged in your
ears long after the antecedent's
meaning has faded from memory.
Signifier blends with signified as
meaning becomes divorced from
semantics. That is, if meaning
exists to begin with.
These are the questions posed
by Pulitzer-prize winning poet
Donald H. Carpenter in his lat-
est collection, which the New
York Times Book Review dubbed,
"a venerable display of linguis-
tic wits destined to leave Noam
Chomsky quaking in his boots."
In a recent interview with The
Michigan Daily, Carpenter, noto-
riously reclusive from the media,
sat down to discuss poetry, his
recent hiatus to Yemen and, of
course, pronouns.
TMD: You've been MIA for

about the past 10 years. Care to
discuss your J.D. Salinger status?
DHC: Well, you see, much of
one's growth as an artist depends
on silence. If I were to discuss
with you as fragile an experience
as Yemen, the entire period could
be erased.
TMD: You're speaking meta-
phorically?
DHC: Not so much metaphor,
but a desire to examine myself
from an external lens, what Jona-
than Franzen might term "self-
transformation."
TMD: OK, that doesn't really
make sense.
DHC: In many ways, I feel my
life has been a constant attempt
to escape my own shadow. You
could call that the Robert Louis
Stevenson side of me.
TMD: I have no idea what

you're talking about. Let's turn to
your book. Can you explain why
you wrote an entire poetry col-
lection focused on the increasing
irrelevance of the pronoun "it"?
DHC: It's a problem I've been
dealing with since I was a boy.
To the extent that any of us ever.
actually had "it," I think the
general trend in our society has
been one of dispersion, making
any form of centrality virtually
impossible. And the only formal
device I could find of broaching
this existential dilemma seemed
to be generative linguistics.
TMD: Sounds fascinating.
And, I mean, I just thought this
thing was about sex when I first
saw the cover. Thanks for your
time.
DHC: Not a problem at all.

and 18th century France,
this weekly installment

Couple transforms
living room into
performance space
By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
Senior Arts Editor
In Jon Brown's living room,
formal wear becomes t-shirts and
jeans. Stuffy theater chairs trans-
form into sagging couches next to
a staircase where students perch,
bottles of beer in hand.
Since September, Brown, a
graduate student studying per-
cussion at the University, and
his girlfriend Sarah Chabot have
hosted small, in-home shows in
their living room on North Cam-
pus, near the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance. Unlike the typi-
cal party, these gatherings high-
light classical music and other
genres typically constrained to a
more formal setting.
"What we really wanted to
try to do was to get people that
don't come to (formal) concerts
to come out and make it a more
relaxed atmosphere," Brown said.
"So it's not just sitting in a concert
hall having to be really quiet, hav-
ing to sit there with your hands
crossed and not say anything and
not talk to your neighbor."
Chabot originally proposed the
idea of hosting the series in their
home, instead of renting a venue,
giving way to the name "Living
Room Music."
The mood at their concerts
is casual, Chabot explained.
Attendees can enjoy a glass of
beer or wine while discussing and
sharing notes on performances
- a marked change from the tra-
ditional, stuffy atmosphere of
classical music venues.
"I really love having people in
my living room," she said. "It's a
great environment to have people
... playing in."
"It changed how I view my liv-
ing room," Brown said of the first
concert. "It was so communal."
Not only is the atmosphere of
Living Room Music communal,
it's welcoming. Admission is free
and attendees are encouraged to
bring refreshments to share.
The setup is simple: A tie-dyed
green tapestry hangs behind
the main performance space.
According to Brown, all of the
sound equipment belongs to him
and consists of pieces accrued
through his years as a musician.

Korea watching."
The pair has already begun
brainstorming ideas to make
upcoming shows even better,
such as incorporating visual art.
Chabot explained that they will
feature a visual artist at each
performance and have set aside
a small space where artists will
be able to display their artwork,
whatever the medium might be.
"We're going to try to get some
poetry readings," Brown added.
"I'd like to get some vocalists -
that would be cool."
The next show - to be held on
Nov. 17 - already has a full set.
There will be multiple Phillip
Glass pieces, a contemporary bass
performance and a composer vis-
iting from Michigan State Univer-
sity who will premiere new work.
The series has garnered
increasing attention since the
first show. While Chabot said
they're excited to expand, they're
also limited by the size of their
venue. The second show was so
packed that some people had to
sit on the floor, less than an arm's
length away from the artists.
And yet, Chabot said this is
exactly what Living Room Music
is about: intimacy and leisure.
"Nothing against any other
performance out there, but
when you go to a concert at, say,
Hill Auditorium to see a sym-
phony play, you're in the audi-
ence and they're on stage," Sies
said. "They're dressed up in tux-
edos and you're in your regular
clothes, and it creates a divide
between the audience and the
performer.
"With this Living Room Music
idea, it brings everyone together
on the same plane," Sies added.
"No one's up on a stage. Every-
one's on the same level. Everyone
is really close to each other."
Chabot-and Brownhope to con-
tinue to break down that barrier,
meaning the series will remain in
their living room. But when look-
ing for a new home, they will keep
their growing audience in mind.
"That would be the goal for
expanding in the future: to be
able to make it bigger and publi-
cize more heavily," Chabot said.
Running the series from their
home keeps costs down, and as
Sies explained, in the current
economy, arts events are getting
harder and harder to support.
"The underground stuff is
where the real passionate people
are," Sies said. "Everyone who's
participating in this thing is 100
percent in it to win it."

HILL
FromPage 1B
state-of-the-art concert hall,
which was no small sum consid-
ering that at the time, an average
American home cost approxi-
mately $3,500. Accounting for
inflation, $200,000would amount
to millions in today's currency.
In addition to Hill's large dona-
tion, $150,000 was necessary to
purchase the required land and
begin construction.
LSA alum Tamar Galed, whose
history thesis focuses on Hill
Auditorium, wrote that in order
to procure the required fund-
ing, politician Charles Sink, who
would later serve as UMS presi-
dent, traveled to the state legis-
lature. He managed to convince
government officials that the
auditorium would have a lasting
positive impact on the cultural
and' economic atmosphere of
Michigan.
"(Sink) managed to convince
the state government that Hill
Auditorium was more than just
a gift to the University," Galed
wrote in his thesis. "It was an
investment for our college's
future."
Just the basics
Before construction began in
1911, three basic requirements
for Hill Auditorium were identi-
fied: The finished hall had to be
large enough to host the entire
student body, the acoustics of
the auditorium had to be suf-
ficiently developed so a single
speaker's unamplified voice
would be audible to the entire
audience, and Hill had to be able
to house the celebrated Colum-
bian organ, which had been
purchased in 1894 for $25,000
through the efforts of Kelsey
and UMS.
Reischl said the organ is still
regarded as one of the auditori-
um's crown jewels.
"(The organ) was the most
technologically advanced of its
time and a marvel to behold,"
Reischl said. "It was modi-
fied and improved before being
moved to Hill in 1913, where it's
still used by students and teach-
ers today."
The organ was later renamed
the Freize Memorial Organ in
honor of Henry Simmons Freize,
a Latin professor and the first act-
ing president of UMS. Today, the
organ serves as the focal point
of the auditorium's parabolically
curved interior.
To oversee construction of
the new hall, then-University
president H.B. Hutchins chose
renowned Detroit architect
Albert Kahn.
Sophie Kruz, a video producer
for UMS who is currently making
a documentary about the organi-
zation's 100-year history in Hill
Auditorium, said the decision to
pick Kahn was based largely on
his previous work with large-scale
factory design, which required a
reinforced concrete construction
technique he developed.
"The reinforced concrete tech-
nique allowed Kahn to construct
buildings without needing to use
wooden support beams," Kruz
said. "Without the need of sup-
port beams, the hall could be
made large enough to be molded
into the dimensions and shape

necessary for the required acous-
tics."
The single tilted parabolic
shape that Kahn and acoustics
engineer Hugh Tallant chose was
based on Tallant's analysis of how
sound traveled in an enclosed
structure.
"Tallant saw the movement of
sound inside a building as very
similar to light bouncing off a mir-
ror, and he wanted to direct it at
the audience," Reischl said. "And
(looking) back atthe design layout
for Hill, it's interestingnotingthat
the hall really looks like a giant
megaphone blaring music in the
direction of the audience mem-
bers."

Hill Auditorium was originally intended to seat all students and faculty at the University.

Kahn was also known to be
an efficient designer, opting for a
simple, brick-layered exterior and
a high-utility interior. As noted by
Kruz, this utility came in the form
of fluid natural lighting, a devel-
oped ventilation system and, of
course, excellent acoustics.
"Kahn was well known for his
innovation and eye towards effi-
ciency in design," Kruz said. "He
had a great ability to design build-
ings for function and I think it's
visible in Hill."
Kahn wrapped construction
of the building in approximately
two years. Upon completion in
1913, the venue was already being
regarded asa monument to acous-
tic design comparable to Carnegie
Hall in New York City.
After performing in the May
Festival of 1913, Frederick Stock,
conductor of the Chicago Sym-
phony Orchestra, called the audi-
torium flawless.
"It is perfect. There seems to
be no flaw anywhere; the acous-
tics are perfect," Stock told the
Daily in an article published in
1913. "Like a violin, such a build-
ing improves with age; it must
get tempered to the sound. You
should be proud of your new
auditorium; there is not another
building like it in the country."
From Kombrink to Caruso
Over the years, news of
the auditorium's supposed
unmatched acoustical quality
reached distinguished performers
across the world. Hill was quickly
becoming one of the most lauded
music centers in the country.
Famous soprano Ilona Kom-
brink felt that the interestinspired
by the hall was a result of how eas-,
ily the acoustics enhanced merely
average performances.
"I think anyone could perform
there and achieve an excellence,"
Kombrink wrote in a 1980 letter
to UMS. "The hall fairly takes
you by the hand acoustically and
gives you a marvelous platform on
which to perform."
Kruz, whose documentary
takes an in-depth look at the
development and growth of Hill
Auditorium, said perhaps the
most recognizable performance
of the hall's beginning years was
by famous Italian tenor Enrico
Caruso in 1919.

She explained how Charles
Sink, a leader of UMS at the time,
traveled to New York to petition
Caruso to bring his talents to
Michigan.
"This was a huge accomplish-.
ment because Caruso was one of
the most famous singers in the
world at that time," Kruz said.
"I think his decision to perform
in this small, mid-western town
really put UMS and Ann Arbor on
the map as a destination for major
concert artists."
The hall has inspired a'sense
of loyalty in the artists who have
graced its stage. According to
associate professor of musicol-
ogy Mark Clague, the undeniable
allure of the auditorium is likely a
result of the audience interaction
provided by the hall's acoustics.
"As a performer, the fact that
you can hear thiswave of applause
coming back atyou lets you estab-
lish a very satisfying commu-
nication between the stage and
the audience," Clague said. "This
symbiotic relationship that Hill
creates between the performer
and the audience is mutually
inspiring."
Rheme Sloan, a junior vocal-
ist in the School of MT&D, added
that petforming in the acoustical
environment of Hill Auditorium
allows artists to further hone
their individual talent.
"When you're singing on the
Hill stage, the first thing you
notice is thatyou can't immediate-
ly hear the person singing next to
you," Sloan said. "And that's when
being a musician really comes into
play because you really have no
one to rely on but yourself."
Leonard Bernstein, the Ameri-
can composer, performed the
1988 Bernstein Benefit concert in
which he conducted the -Vienna
Philharmonic Orchestra for what
would be his last time in Ann
Arbor.
"I remember the Leonard Ber-
nstein concert because I was a
student in the School of Music at
the time," Clague said. "The per-
formance that he gave that night
was without a doubt my favorite
performance ever at Hill. The
whole experience was just rivet-
ing.
"I remember he would insist on
waiting backstage to meet with
anyone who was willing. As I look
back on it, getting to meet him had

a profound influence on me as a
musician and a teacher," he added.
Celebrating community
It's difficult to measure the
impact the auditorium has had
on Ann Arbor and the University
because of the multitude of expe-
riences it has provided for stu-
dents over the past century.
"Hill has seen two world wars
in its lifetime and in those times
of war, it was always a place where
people could just gather and cele-
brate music," Kruz said.
Reischl added that the sheer
amount of notoriety the hall has
given Ann Arbor in the music
world is somethingto be marveled
at and will keep artists coming
back for decades to come.
"The fact that the New York
Philharmonic chooses Hill as one
of three or four stops on a tour is
nothing short of amazing," Reis-
chl said. "There are not many
other college halls that attract
that kind of talent."
Just as UMS took the initiative
to procure funding for the con-
struction of the hall 100 years ago,
the organization is now leading
celebrations of Hill's upcoming
anniversary.
In order to mark the century of
memories the hall has inspired in
Ann Arbor, UMS will be hosting
a Hill Immersion Day on Feb. 2,
2013. The day will start with "Sat-
urday Morning Physics," a spe-
cial event in which experts will
discuss the science behind one of
the most acoustically perfect halls
in the world. The celebration will
continue with tours and activi-
ties highlighting the relationship
between Hill and the community,
culminating with the premiere
of Kruz's documentary about the
hall.
Clague, who is currently host-
ing a three-part lecture on the
history of Hill and its relationship
with the University, explained
that Hill has become more than
just a concert hall during its 100
years.
"I feel like Hill now serves as
a diplomatic mission between
the school and the community,"
Clague said. "Hill has brought a
range of voices and cultures to the
campus and I think it's our duty to
reach out and put the University
in service of our city."
