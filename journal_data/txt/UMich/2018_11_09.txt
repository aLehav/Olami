The Heartland Independent 

Film Forum, in partnership with 
The Michigan Daily, hosted a 
launch event Thursday night at 
the Ann Arbor Public Library for 
an online database containing 
every impact statement of the 
survivors of Larry Nassar. The 
database is intended to aid 
students, families, educators and 
journalists in understanding this 

decades-long pattern of abuse. 
About 25 students and Ann Arbor 
residents were in attendance.

Larry Nassar, a former USA 

Gymnastics 
and 
Michigan 

State University physician, was 
sentenced to 40 to 175 years in 
prison for sexual abuse of young 
girls and women in January. 
More than 160 women came 
forward in court earlier this year 
to testify against him.

The event featured two panels 

— the first with survivors sharing 

their stories and another with 
journalists who covered the trial 
and proceedings — sought to 
reflect on the scandal and educate 
the audience to prevent similar 
patterns of abuse in the future.

Roger Rapoport, director of 

the Heartland Independent Film 
Forum, purchased the records 
for the database, which included 
1,400 pages of accounts from 
survivors. Rapoport, a survivor 
himself, said this project would 
allow the truth to be shared.

“When I heard about Larry 

Nassar case and the courage of 
these women … I was so amazed 
by what they were saying in court 
that I bought the trial transcripts 
(with help of donors),” Rapoport 
said.

Michigan 
Radio 
reporter 

Kate Wells was also present at 
the event. Wells worked on the 
podcast “Believed,” which shares 
many stories of survivors in 
depth. The podcast has already 

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
Interfraternity 

Council 
voted 
Wednesday 

to remove the Alpha Sigma 
Phi fraternity from campus, 
the Office of Fraternity and 
Sorority Life said in a press 
release. 
Members 
of 
the 

IFC voted unanimously to 
terminate Alpha Sigma Phi’s 
Theta chapter following an 
investigation by the Hazing 
Response 
Team 
regarding 

allegations of hazing during 
their new member process.

The termination came after 

the 
Student 
Organization 

Advancement and Recognition 
review process was carried 
out by the Greek Activities 
Review Panel. The Hazing 
Response Team investigation 
revealed extensive evidence 
of hazing violations, leading 
to their removal. The IFC also 
specified the fraternity will 
be unable to recolonize on the 
University campus for at least 
five years.

“These 
sanction 
result 

from 
a 
Hazing 
Response 

Team 
investigation 
that 

found substantial evidence 
of 
dangerous 
recurring 

practices within the Alpha 
Sigma 
Phi’s 
new 
member 

process, 
including 
forced 

alcohol 
consumption 
and 

violent physical hazing,” the 
IFC 
statement 
reads. 
“As 

a result, Alpha Sigma Phi 
has been removed from the 
University of Michigan and 
the Interfraternity Council 
for a minimum of five (5) 
calendar 
years, 
effective 

immediately.”

The removal comes amid 

controversy in the Greek life 
community 
over 
the 
past 

year, including the Nov. 9, 
2017 suspension of all social 
events 
for 
the 
remainder 

of the fall 2017 semester 
following sexual assault and 
hazing allegations. While the 
suspension was self-imposed 
by the IFC, the council cited 
three near-death incidents 
and 30 hospitalizations during 
the weekend of the football 
game against Michigan State 
University.

Social activities resumed 

during 
the 
winter 
2018 

semester.

In the wake of President 

Donald 
Trump’s 
decision 

to 
dismissformer 
Attorney 

General Jeff Sessions, more 
than 400 students, faculty 
and city residents marched 
through Ann Arbor streets 
Thursday night to protest the 
president’s 
announcement 

and show support for special 
counsel 
Robert 
Mueller’s 

investigation into potential 
collusion with Russia during 
the 2016 presidential election.

On Wednesday, the day 

after the midterm elections, 
President 
Trump 
replaced 

Sessions 
with 
Sessions’s 

former Chief of Staff Matthew 
Whitaker. 
According 
to 

national 
news 
outlets, 

Trump had reportedly been 
disgruntled 
with 
Sessions 

for numerous months, after 
Sessions 
recused 
himself 

from

Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council 

discussed the implications of 
a ballot measure requiring the 
creation of a public park in 
downtown Ann Arbor as well as 
the regulation of Bird scooters at 
its meeting Thursday night.

Alan Haber, a community 

activist and vocal proponent of 
Proposal A, spoke during public 
comment about the creation of 
a public park on the land next to 
the Ann Arbor District Library 
following the ballot measure 
passage on Tuesday night.

city to hold onto the parcel of land

The 
Michigan 
Refugee 

Assistance Program, a student-
led organization dedicated to 
assisting 
recently 
resettled 

refugees in the greater Detroit and 
Ann Arbor areas, held the second 
of their four-part roundtable 
series Thursday night examining 
the intersectional issues within 
the refugee crisis. This particular 
speaker event was focused on 
examining educational barriers 
faced by refugees as well as the 
response, or lack thereof, from 
refugee communities, nonprofits 
and students. The event was held 
at Weill Hall and was attended 
by about 25 undergraduate and 
graduate students.

LSA junior Ayah Kutmah, vice 

president of External Affairs for 
MRAP and one of the event’s 
organizers, said the organization’s 
purpose 
goes 
beyond 
solely 

supporting refugees in Southeast 
Michigan. 
Rather, 
Kutmah 

said MRAP hopes to teach the 
community about the diverse set 
of difficulties affecting refugees. 
She, as well as the rest of MRAP, 
said they hoped these roundtable 
events would help fulfill that goal 
of educating the student body 
about issues related to refugees 
like education, as well as dispel 
any inaccuracies regarding the 
refugee crisis.

“Our speaker series, in general, 

arose from the need to look at 
intersectionality, not just looking 
at refugees as people that just 
resettle or that you donate to,” 
Kutmah said. “We are looking at 
the things that they struggle with 

both institutionally in the United 
States and globally, so one of those 
things is education.”

She 
explained 
there 
are 

dangerous 
assumptions 
about 

the refugee crisis, particularly 
regarding the fact that people fail 
to consider the issues that impact 
refugees beyond just resettlement.

“When 
people 
think 
of 

refugees, they don’t think of 
education and they don’t think 
of the barriers of education,” 
Kutmah said. “They don’t think 
about the intersectionality of 
different things.”

LSA 
and 
Art 
& 
Design 

freshman 
Gabe 
Consiglio 

echoed 
Kutmah’s 
sentiments 

about 
the 
student 
body’s 

problem of overgeneralizing and 
misunderstanding issues related 
to refugees.

“We’re in a climate right now 
where it is really important 
to 
talk 
about 
this 
just 

because people are ignorant,” 
Consiglio said. “It is important 
to get talking about this to 
have people understand that … 
(refugees) are just like us and 
they’re not a threat like a lot of 
people would think that they 
are.”

Lilah 
Khoja, 
a 
Public 

Health 
graduate 
student 

focusing on medical issues 
affecting refugees and female 
reproductive 
health, 
lead 

the 
roundtable 
discussion 

about the importance and 
intersectional 
impact 
of 

education on the refugee 
crisis. Though Khoja did not 
understate the number of 
problems affecting refugees, 
she focused her presentation 
on education because she said 
she believes it to be the most 
withstanding problem.

“Education 
is 
a 
really 

valuable asset,” Khoja said. 
“People 
can 
take 
away 

anything from you. You can 
lose your house, you can lose 
your job, but you can’t lose 

your education. That’s something 
that you have with you from the 
moment that you get it until the 
moment that you die.”

Not 
only 
is 
education 

important 
for 
creating 
and 

shaping citizens into intelligent, 
impactful individuals of society, 
Khoja argued, but being educated 
is directly related to a variety of 
other parts of our society, such as 
having immensely better health, 
a longer life expectancy and a 
lower potential for abuse and 
exploitation among many other 
potential side effects.

“Education is the one thing that 

really has the ability to lift people 
out of poverty, has the ability to 
make people healthier, to make 
people productive members of 
society,” Khoja said.

Despite the overt importance 

of education, Khoja said refugees 
face extreme obstacles to getting 
an education. Khoja attributed this 
because of a few specific reasons. 
She 
argues 
that 
educational 

barriers within primary and 
secondary schools exist because 
of little to no funding.

Furthermore, 
Khoja 
said 

these obstacles are exacerbated 
by language differences and 
unfamiliar 
education 
systems 

that 
exist 
between 
different 

countries and school systems. 
Beyond primary and secondary 
education, there are barriers that 
exist within tertiary education — 
only 1 percent of them have access 
to tertiary school.

Access to higher education is 

seen as a luxury, not a fundamental 
right like it is the U.S., Khoja 
stated. Only those with a lot of 
money will have access to higher 
education because it is expensive. 
However, Khoja said refugees 
are not even inclined to invest in 
it because it will not guarantee 
them a job afterward.

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA freshman Zack 
Blumberg discussed his experience covering the Stop Trump 
protest against Trump’s firing of former Attorney General Jeff 
Sessions.

Previously, I had only covered events so it was a lot more chaotic in the 
sense that there wasn’t an order where I could just interview people 
like 1, 2, 3 and then find the organizer. You had to be a lot more diligent 
on your own. I had to take people aside during the protest which they 
weren’t super excited about and when the event was over, I had to be 
very perceptive so I could get an interview with organizers right away. 
Other than that, it was much colder than a normal event because it 
was outside so my hands were kind of numb by the end but overall, it 
was a fun experience.”

Diag Thursday. 

BLOOD DRIVE

Earlier 
this 
semester, 

multiple 
fraternities 

disaffiliated from University 
IFC. 
The 
five 
current 

unaffiliated fraternities are still 
recognized by the University 
but they have not completed 

necessary paperwork and social 
standards in order to join and 
be recognized as a member of 
the IFC. However, Alpha Sigma 
Phi joins the group of seven 
“rogue” fraternities who are 
not recognized by the IFC or 
the University, and are deemed 
closed. Alpha Sigma Phi will be 
the fourth fraternity to close 
this calendar year.

next to the library in perpetuity 
and develop a public park, passed 
with 53 percent of the vote on Nov. 
6, despite opposition from Mayor 
Christopher Taylor. The mayor 
said in an email to constituents 
prior to Tuesday’s elections that 
the ballot measure was “unfunded 
and unwise.”

Haber 
said 
he 
envisioned 

turning what is now a parking 
lot into a public commons for the 
people of Ann Arbor.

“The notion of the commons is 

that it is for everyone,” Haber said. 
“A majority did say they wanted 
it, also a significant minority 
said they didn’t want, or wanted 
something else, and the task of 
the creation of the commons, is 
that while we invite ourselves 
to this, we invite everyone. And 
this is now the opportunity of the 
community that we are doing this 
commons to put your best vision, 
ideas (on) how to make a beautiful 
place in the center of the city 
that will be a destination for all 
around.”

Proposal A derails a Chicago 

developer’s plans to build a 17-story 
high-rise on the lot. The proposal 
is in direct conflict with City 
Council’s decision in April 2017 to 
sell the Library Lot to Core Spaces 
and its later approval of a $10 
million purchase agreement in 
June 2018 to allow the company to 
build a complex that would include 
a hotel, apartments, office and 
retail space. Half of the proceeds 
from the sale — which amounts 
to $5 million — was allocated to 
providing affordable housing in 
the city.

City Councilmember Chuck 

Warpehoski, D-Ward 5, said the 
implementation of Proposal A 
would be a challenge for the next 
City Council, warning that the 
ballot measure’s passage will be 
a challenge for the new council 
members to wrestle with — and 
one that could result in legal 
complications.

“I was grateful and intrigued 

to hear Mr. Haber talk about his 
vision of the commons as a place 
that nobody is excluded from,” 
Warpehoski 
said. 
“Certainly 

the challenge that Mr. Haber 
left us with at the end of how 
do we include people who are 
experiencing homelessness in not 
just this space but our broader 
community is a big challenge 
(because) the loss of the $5 
million from the sale of the price 
will impair our ability to be an 
inclusive community.”

Following Haber’s comments, 

Assistant City Administrator John 
Fournier discussed a resolution 
to approve an interim agreement 
with electric scooter operator Bird 
regulating the use of the scooters 
in the city. The agreement would 
last for 90 days, but could be 
extended for up to one year. 
Fournier said to his knowledge 
there had only been one scooter-
related accident reported to law 
enforcement since they were 
introduced earlier in the year.

“What we have is a record 

of the scooters operating in 
the city rather safely, but still, 
even with that knowledge, the 
agreement gives the city quite a 
bit of leeway with the operator,” 
Fournier said. “The operator has 
to provide educational material 
to users that the city can approve. 
The agreement requires that 
the 
operator 
take 
financial 

responsibility when scooters are 
used inappropriately or parked 
inappropriately.”

Fournier said the city had been 

active in seizing scooters when 
they were parked inappropriately, 
charging 
$150 
per 
scooter 

impounded. In the first 10 days of 
the scooters’ introduction, 30 were 
seized, but Fournier said since 
then only 10 have been seized. 
He noted that compliance with 
city ordinances had “increased 
substantially.”

City 
Councilmember 
Jane 

Lumm, I-Ward 2, criticized Bird 
for launching their scooters in 
Ann Arbor without warning city 
officials.

“It’s hard for me to get past the 

fact that I think it’s irresponsible 
for Bird rides just to show up in 
Ann Arbor unannounced and 
drop off their scooters, forcing the 
city and the University to jump 
through hoops,” Lumm said. “I 
mean, that to me demonstrated 
zero concern for safety.”

Additionally, 
City 
Council 

unanimously approved amended 
bylaws to a citizen-led police 
oversight commission, clarifying 
that city council liaisons will 
appoint members to the oversight 
commission 
among 
other 

procedural details. Taylor noted 
the contentious path surrounding 
the drafting of the commission, 
including 
a 
competing 

proposal from a citizen task force 
convened by the city’s Human 
Rights Commission.

“This brings the prelude of the 

commission to a close,” Taylor 
said. “It’s been a long process. It’s 
been a difficult process, but I think 
the substance of what we have, 
the substance of the ordinance, 
the substance of the commission 
is going to be, I believe, good for 
everyone.”

While he said he did not plan to 

address the ordinance’s preamble 
during 
the 
meeting, 
Taylor 

mentioned he had heard from law 
enforcement officers that they 
found some of the implications 
about racism in policing to be 
hurtful, especially to officers of 
color.

“I’m going to look to us to how 

we can address this problem going 
forward,” Taylor said.

The council also unanimously 

passed a resolution requesting 
immigration 
authorities 
stay 

the deportation of a man from 
Guinea who has taken refuge in 
a Quaker house of worship. 
Mohamed Soumah, who works 
as a custodian at the University, 
is residing in the Ann Arbor 
Friends 
Meeting 
House 
to 

avoid deportation. Soumah has 
a genetic kidney disease that 
requires frequent dialysis, and 
says he will die if deported 
because he will no longer have 
access 
to 
adequate 
medical 

equipment.

Soumah came to the United 

States in 2002 and has regularly 
applied for and received U.S. work 
visas. However, Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement declared 
him a fugitive alien for overstaying 
his allotted term.

Warpehoski said ICE had a 

policy 
against 
apprehending 

people in sensitive places, such 
as houses of worship or medical 
facilities.

“This resolution is a show of 

support for him by the council 
… Because his doctors and other 
medical professionals who have 
reviewed his case do believe that 
for him to be deported would be a 
death sentence,” Warpehoski said.

Trump’s 
potential 
ties 
to 

Russia. Sessions’s recusal had 
left Deputy Attorney General 
Rod J. Rosenstein in charge of 
the investigation. Rosenstein 
was responsible for appointing 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller 
to the case.

The march was organized 

and led by Stop Trump Ann 
Arbor, an organization created 
in the wake of the 2016 election 
to 
protest 
against 
Trump’s 

policies. Thousands of other 
protests were staged across the 
country in a display of solidarity 
with Mueller’s investigation. 
The Ann Arbor march started 
at the Federal Building on East 
Liberty Street, before crossing 
the Diag, around in front of the 
University Museum of Modern 
Art and back to the Federal 
Building.

The protest began with a 

number of speakers outside of 
the Federal Building in front 
of a crowd packed with anti-
Trump and pro-Mueller signs. 
Most of the speakers touched 
on issues relating to Trump’s 
perceived misuses of power or 
his hostility toward women, 
minorities 
and 
immigrants. 

After the speeches concluded, 
protest organizers lead the 
group to the Diag and back, 
flanked by police cars. Once 
the march made it back to 
the 
Federal 
Building, 
the 

organizers held an open mic, 
allowing any of the protesters 
to come and speak before the 
event concluded.

Adam 
Nash, 
one 
of 
the 

leaders of Stop Trump Ann 
Arbor and a march organizer, 
said he thought the march 
was a good start to opposing 
Trump’s 
actions 
through 

organizing. However, he also 
said there was still more to 
do, and going forward, this 
wasn’t simply about voting in 
the 2018 midterm elections or 
participating in one march.

“I 
feel 
like 
people 
are 

realizing that we can’t just vote 
in the right people and trust 
them to do the right thing,” 
Nash said. “That was reflected 
in the open mic, when people 
came up, and the spontaneous 
chants people started, like ‘Let 
Mueller do his job, or we’ll give 
Trump his angry mob,’ that’s 
pretty good. I don’t know if it’s 
radical, but I feel like people 
are waking up.”

Nash continued on to say he 

knows a single protest wouldn’t 
reshape anything, but numerous 
marches and innovative new 
tactics 
could 
be 
extremely 

effective in creating change. 
He also stressed how it is more 
difficult for the government to 
ignore large demonstrations, 
as opposed to a single march. 
He 
additionally 
commended 

the role University of Michigan 
students 
and 
faculty 
have 

taken in past protests and said 
he called on them to continue 
protesting innovatively.

“The 
entrenched 
power 

structures have learned how 
to weather one day of protests, 
they’re good at that,” Nash said. 
“The 
unprecedented-ness 
of 

this will wake a lot of people 
up and the unity of the people 
who came out will motivate 
them to continue resisting … 
Historically U-M students and 
teachers have lead the way 
in 
resistance. 
The 
teach-in 

was invented here at the U-M 
campus and I want to see more 
of that … If there’s something 
new, 
entrenched 
power 

structures won’t know how 
to respond to that. We need 
diversity of tactics.”

March 
leader 
Jessica 

Prozinski said she felt the 
march was a success and a win 
for democracy.

“I think that we did exactly 

what we needed to do when 
we needed to do it,” Prozinski 
said. “I’m looking forward to 
going home and seeing what 
the protests looked like all 

across the country. I think that 
this was a good protest because 
it was very democratic, we had 
the open mic at the end. I feel 
like people in Ann Arbor got 
a chance to have their voices 
heard.”

She 
also 
likened 
the 

methodology of the movement 
to that of the civil rights 
movement 
in 
the 
1960s, 

saying she felt voting was not 
enough and protesting was 
also essential to fighting for 
progress.

“We 
need 
to 
keep 
this 

movement 
going,” 
Prozinski 

said. “And people keep asking, 
‘What’s 
next,’ 
or 
‘What’s 

tomorrow?’ To be honest, to a 
certain extent we don’t know. 
But we know that we need to 
stay active and we need to keep 
coming out into the streets. 
Voting is not enough … We are 
trying to build a mass direct 
action movement, to change 
things beyond the ballot box, 
not within the confines of the 
approved, strictly voting-based 
system.”

LSA sophomore Zac Kolbusz 

said he came to the protest 
because he felt it was important 
to stand up to injustices, and 
the best way to do that was 
through protesting. He also 
called upon other students to 
join the movement as well.

“We live in a nation where 

our laws and our constitution 
have been compromised by a 
complicit (Republican Party),” 
Kolbusz said. “As students, we 
have a responsibility to stand 
up for our future, and to stand 
up for people marginalized 
by this campus, and the only 
way we can do that is through 
mass mobilization. I’d like to 
call on students to mobilize, to 
participate in something bigger 
than they are, and to protect 
what they can while they still 
can do it.”

In addition to organizers and 

students, Ann Arbor residents 
joined the demonstration to 
convey their thoughts about 
the 
president’s 
decision 
to 

effectively fire Sessions. Ann 
Arbor resident Dave Schlenker 
said he felt Trump was a fascist, 
and people needed to prevent 
Trump from weakening the 
investigation against himself.

“I’m with the anti-fascists 

and 
Trump 
is 
a 
fascist,” 

Schlenker said. “He’s blatantly 
and 
flagrantly 
abusing 
his 

power 
to 
try 
and 
appoint 

crony people who will do 
his bidding, essentially. He’s 
trying 
to 
defend 
himself 

from investigation but we’re 
not going to let that happen. 
Hopeful,ly Whittaker recuses 
himself or resigns, obviously. 
Best case scenario, the laws 
in place as they are written, 
Rod Rosenstein gets put in the 
attorney general position and 
continues the investigation.”

After 
the 
first 
protest 

Thursday, 
the 
organization 

announced they have a second 
protest planned for 12 p.m. on 
Friday at the Diag.

Fanning spoke about the 

struggles he faced as a gay 
man in the armed forces.

“I 
didn’t 
think 
(being 

openly gay) was going to be 
as big of an issue as it was 
— it wasn’t in my training 
years, when I was in military 
intelligence it wasn’t an issue, 
but then I got stationed in 
an infantry unit … I got hate 
mail, especially, put under 
my door for a few months and 
then people got used to the 
idea, actually,” Fanning said.

Kelley, 
however, 
spoke 

quite 
differently 
of 
her 

experiences.

“I mean, for me, my 

experience 
was 
really 

positive,” she said. “And 
I know that there is some 
gender 
expectation 
from 

our society, I can definitely 
understand how a gay man 
would have a harder time 
in the military than a gay 
female. If anything, for me, I 
was just able to bro out with 
the other guys.”

Fanning spoke about the 

LGBTQ support group he 
joined at his base.

“There was no rank, no 

limitations, so we ended 
up having a lot of juniors 
enlisted and senior officers 
who were in this safe space 
and could talk about their 
experiences,” he said.

The 
U.S. 
military 

maintained an official ban 
on all LGBTQ persons in 
the military from the time 
of World War II until the 
passage of the “Don’t Ask, 

Don’t Tell” policy in 1993. The 
policy, signed by President 
Bill 
Clinton 
Clinton, 

prohibited LGBTQ members 
of the armed forces from 
disclosing 
their 
sexuality 

while also prohibiting official 
questioning 
regarding 

sexuality.

“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was 

repealed in 2011, allowing 
gay, bisexual and lesbian 
members of the military to 
serve openly. This has also 
allowed 
the 
experiences 

and struggles of LGBTQ 
servicemembers have come 
into focus.

Nursing freshman Adam 

Dobry, 
ROTC 
member, 

attended the event to try to 
improve his own awareness 
of 
issues 
LGBTQ 
people 

might face in the military.

“I felt like (this panel) 

would 
be 
a 
bit 
more 

interesting than a lot of 
the other ones, it seemed 
like it would be a bit more 
informative, 
especially 

for becoming an officer, to 
know how to treat certain 
individuals and be aware of 
certain things,” Dobry said.

VMSP 
Director 
Phil 

Larson elaborated on the 
purpose of the event.

“In the media and pop 

culture, there’s a lot of 
stereotyping, the military is 
a monolith, but it’s made of 
individuals,” Larson said.

After the event, Fanning 

told The Daily about why he 
joined the army and how he 
reflects on his time in the 
service.

gained recognition for its 
work in exposing the abuse.

“It’s really exciting, our 

goal with the podcast too, is 
the same goal as this project 
— to have as many people 
understand as wide of the 
story as possible and what the 
background and depth (is),” 
Wells said.

Each 
of 
the 
panelists 

shared 
their 
backgrounds 

and how they came together 
to form this network of 
survivors.

Trinea Gonczar, another 

survivor, 
now 
works 
for 

Wayne County SAFE, which 
forensically 
examines 

sexual assault and provides 
resources 
to 
survivors. 

Gonczar said education on 
the Nassar case and other 
instances of sexual assault 
is important to help prevent 
future abuses.

“Our strongest mission is 

to educate the community,” 
Gonczar said. “The more 
conversations we’re having, 
whether it’s 30 people in a 
room or 300, they’re just as 
important.”

For 
survivor 
Christina 

Barba, she did not realize 
she belonged to this cohort 
of women until the first news 
came out about the trial.

“I was around 14, but my 

story is different in that I 
did not realize until this year 
January,” Barba said. “I’m 

listening to all these women 
with tears rolling down my 
face and the realization that 
this is my story.”

Survivors Larissa Boyce 

and Jessica Smith also spoke 
on the panel.

Detroit 
News 
reporter 

Kim Kozlowski later shared 
her experience covering the 
stories of these women and 
said the survivors deserve 
the recognition for bringing 
Nassar to trial.

“Even 
though 
it 
was 

the media that made it an 
international 
story, 
we 

had nothing to do with it,” 
Kozlowski said. “What really 
happened was these women 
came forward and they were 
brave.”

Eastern 
Michigan 

University freshman Georgia 
Nagel attended the event. 
With an interest in studying 
women and gender, Nagel 
said she’s hoping to work in 
nonprofits relating to that 
and wanted to directly hear 
the experiences of survivors.

“I wanted to hear exactly 

what they had to say,” Nagel 
said. “I’m so used to hearing 
it secondhand.”

Many of the survivors 

reflected 
on 
how 
being 

a 
parent 
affected 
their 

perspective on what they’ve 
been through. Gonczar said 
she won’t have the same 
level of trust in coaches and 
doctors that her parents did.

The holiday movie season 
is here, and Netflix hasn’t 
forgetten. 
The 
streaming 
service’s recent release “The 
Holiday 
Calendar” 
follows 
Abby Sutton (Kat Graham, 
“The Vampire Diaries”), an 
aspiring photographer whose 
grandfather 
(Ron 
Cephas 
Jones, “This is Us”) gives 
her an advent calendar that, 
instead of chocolate, seems 
to give clues to whatever will 
happen in Abby’s love life that 
day.
Magical 
intervention, 
indirect or direct, is typical 
of any holiday movie and 
“The Holiday Calendar” is 
no different. Abby’s calendar 
influences her decisions and 
is the source of her major 
revelations, both about her life 
and her relationships. While 
the movie relies heavily on 
the reveal of what’s behind 
each little door, “The Holiday 
Calendar” makes good use of 
upbeat Christmas music and 
montages to establish Abby’s 
newfound relationship and the 
decline of her older friendship. 
 
The movie’s two eligible 
bachelors allow “The Holiday 
Calendar” 
to 
explore 
the 
tried-and-true problems that 
come when a main character 
is ignorant to the fact that 

their best friend is in love with 
them. The first half of the 
movie is spent flitting between 
shots of Abby enjoying herself 
with 
her 
childhood 
friend 
Josh (Quincy Brown, “Street”) 
and being swept off her feet 
by the too-perfect doctor Ty 

(Ethan Peck, “The Sorcerer’s 
Apprentice”). Other than the 
inner turmoil of forcing the 
audience to choose between 
two great guys, there isn’t a lot 
to “The Holiday Calendar.” But 
this lack of depth is the reason 
why people gravitate towards 
holiday movies in a time when 
family drama is high, and 
temperatures are low.
Double the love interests, 
though, 
means 
double 
the 
drama, 
and 
when 
Abby’s 
relationship 
with 
Ty 
gets 
in the way of her friendship 
with Josh, she’s forced to 
evaluate her life. The movie 
comes to a climax when Abby 
loses her job, her best friend 
and her new relationship all 
in the span of two days. The 
predictable nature of the way 

the movie ends, with Abby 
holing up in her room and 
ending up with her best friend, 
feels like leaving the Macy’s 
gift-wrapping 
station 
with 
everything neatly tied up.
One 
of 
the 
shining 
characteristics of this movie, 
though, is the cast. Typically, 
holiday 
movies 
follow 
a 
predominantly 
white 
cast 
with the occasional person 
of color thrown in to achieve 
“diversity” 
and 
please 
a 
network representative. But 
“The 
Holiday 
Calendar,” 
instead, has a mixed-race main 
character with a focus on her 
relationship with her African-
American 
grandfather. 
Her 
best friend, and one of the key 
love interests, is also African-
American, 
along 
with 
the 
comedic relief in the form of 
a Latinx third wheel in their 
relationship. The film even 
goes so far as to include a 
Latinx mayor — talk about 
diversity and gender equality.
Though 
the 
plot, 
the 
acting 
and 
the 
cast 
were 
leagues better than any of 
the Hallmark movies, “The 
Holiday Calendar” was still 
lacking in that one, unknown 
quantity that makes a movie 
a holiday classic, like “Love 
Actually” or “Home Alone.” 
Instead, it’s the kind of movie 
watched while baking holiday 
cookies, wrapping presents or 
decorating the tree.

‘The Holiday Calendar’ is 
a perfectly fine romcom

EMMA CHANG
Daily Arts Writer

The first time I heard the name 
Andrew Norman was the day I 
met him. It was the summer of 
2014, and I was spending six weeks 
in rural New England studying 
composition at a music festival by 
the name of Walden. Sometime in 
the middle of the program, those of 
us students able to find the time in 
our schedules took a field trip away 
from our quaint Dublin campus 
to the MacDowell Colony, an 
artists’ retreat located just outside 
of Peterborough, N. H. In a lovely, 
wooded 
location, 
MacDowell 
supports a range of artists — from 
writers to composers to architects 
— with a space for them to live 
in creative isolation, materially 
provided for and removed from the 
quotidian troubles that can distract 
from creative work. As part of our 
visit, the composers in residence at 
the time gave short presentations 
about their work and ideas, playing 
excerpts from pieces of theirs and 
answering questions.
Now 
Norman’s 
name 
is 
everywhere. But that summer was 
the first time I encountered either 
him or his music, and it changed 
the way that I listened, opened 
my ears to musical possibilities I 
had never considered before and 
still influence me today. A blond 
30-something from California who 
seemed practically brimming over 
with exciting ideas, that summer 
Norman was standing on the 
threshold of the classical music 
stardom he would find himself 
thrust into in the intervening years 
between then and now. As far as I 
can tell, he was first quoted in The 
New York Times a few months 
later — by now he has been profiled 
and reviewed and previewed in 
its pages more times than the 
vast majority of composers active 
today. Before all this, in 2012, his 
string trio “The Companion Guide 
to Rome” had been a finalist for 
the Pulitzer Prize in music, but 
that was nothing compared to the 
acclaim that would be directed 
towards him following the wildly 
enthusiastic 
reception 
of 
his 
large-scale, rip-roaring orchestral 
composition “Play.”
This Friday and Saturday the 
Detroit Symphony Orchestra will 
take up “Play,” performing it on 
a program which also includes 
Dvorák’s “Carnival Overture” and 
Beethoven’s “Piano Concerto No. 
1,” played by Emanuel Ax.
When I interviewed Norman 
over the phone this week, he talked 
about some of the ideas behind 
writing “Play,” which — at around 
45 minutes — was his longest 
composition at the time of its 
writing, though by now he has been 
commissioned to write numerous 
concertos, an opera and a wide 

variety of large-scale projects.
“It’s kind of unusual because, 
most of the time, when we get a 
chance to write for orchestra it’s 
usually for a very limited amount 
of time, for a short piece,” Norman 
said. “10 minutes, you know? 
12 minutes. And this was for a 
45-minute-long thing.”

Norman 
wrote 
“Play” 
in 
2013 while he was composer-in-
residence for the Boston Modern 
Orchestra Project, an ensemble 
founded and directed by Gil Rose 
in order to champion the work of 
contemporary composers and to 
explore the connections between 
their music and modern society. 
Having a professional ensemble of 
this sort — one dedicated to playing 
new music — was immensely 
liberating for Norman, as he could 
feel free to make use of a variety 
of 
non-conventional 
playing 
techniques which would give more 
traditional players pause. For his 
part, on a more conceptual level 
Norman was interested in the new 
ways that people think in our fast-
paced, interconnected world, and 
about how he could reflect that 
through the medium of music.
“I was thinking a lot of the idea 
of rupture, and interruption, and 
how in my writing I could suggest 
that an idea has been cut short, that 
it has some future or potential that 
was not reached,” Norman said.
Often, this effect was achieved by 
Norman borrowing concepts from 
other types of media. From video 
games he appropriated the notion 
that an action can directly cause 
a response somewhere else — like 
pressing a button on a video game 
controller causes your character to 
act a certain way, Norman assigned 
specific gestures in the percussion 
section to certain musical reactions 
in the rest of the orchestra.
“I’ve also been thinking about 
systems 
of 
control, 
wherein 
instruments 
control 
other 
instruments, and instruments turn 
each other on and off,” Norman 
said. “The idea that a piece can 
be a system of rules and control, 
that the piece would be about the 
exploration of that system, almost 
like a game has rules a piece can 

have rules.”
More than just that, Norman 
lifted non-linear narrative from 
film and TV, embracing a kind of 
eclecticism of plot that gives the 
piece a freewheeling intensity, an 
edge-of-your-seat type of feeling.
“It’s a little bit like thinking of 
plotlines or narratives or stories 
that all have particular goals, 
and then chopping them up and 
arranging them, sort of collage-
like,” Norman said. “But it only 
works in my mind if no one knows 
what the goal of each story is or 
where it’s headed and where it’s all 
trying to go.”
But when it works, it really 
works. Part of what makes “Play” 
such a fascinating piece is how 
it changes character on a dime, 
flashing between disparate musical 
scenes like the flipping of light 
switches to different rooms. At one 
moment ferocious chords bombard 
you with noise, the next is a tranquil 
stillness — a second later scratching 
glissandi in the strings run up 
and down at a breathtaking rate. 
Whole stretches of the piece careen 
from idea to idea, tripping over 
themselves, spinning head over 
heels as each successive moment is 
interrupted by the next in a chaotic 
display of fireworks. But it’s this 
off-kilter enjambment of identities 
that gives “Play” its sense of self. 
It’s a work that embraces both 
this ferocious complexity and, in 
later movements, gives voice to 
concentrated, passionate emotions, 
as long, straining brass lines seem 
to reach ever higher, yearning to 
break free from the gravity of the 
orchestra beneath them during the 
climax of the piece.
But for a composer whose work 
tends to exhibit such rambunctious 
eclecticism, Norman also has a 
propensity to form years-long 
fixations on musical ideas. One of 
the most fascinating things about 
listening to “Play” is how you can 
hear the evolution of ideas from 
his previous work — traces of “The 
Companion Guide” or “Music in 
Circles” or “Try” (which Norman 
called a “beta version” of “Play”) are 
all to be found here. Unlike many 
contemporary composers, Norman 
doesn’t feel the need to reinvent his 
voice with each new piece, and is 
comfortable revising and recycling 
material in order to bring it closer 
to what he is really trying to say. 
And perhaps this is why he’s one of 
the most interesting musical voices 
heard today: It would be wrong to 
call it a clarity of vision, because 
it’s constantly being reassessed 
and reformed, but Norman has 
a rare dedication to his ideas. He 
follows his thoughts as far as they 
go, returning again and again until 
he has played them out to the end.

What’s in a memory? On 
television, they’re often distorted, 
impressionistic 
constructions 
of the human brain. But in 
“Homecoming,” a superb new 
drama from Amazon Prime Video, 
it’s the present that is faint and 
incomplete, desaturated and boxed 
in a squarish aspect ratio, while the 
past is rendered wholly and lucidly, 
in crisp widescreen.
It’s one of the more inventive 
ways director Sam Esmail (“Mr. 
Robot”) translates the aural tension 
of the show’s source material — 
the popular scripted podcast from 
Gimlet Media — into the year’s most 
visually striking television. He has 
also made the very wise decision 
to keep “Homecoming” roughly 
as long as its podcast predecessor 
— at 10 briskly-paced, half-hour 
episodes, it’s practically designed to 
be consumed in one long watch.
“Homecoming” 
and 
“Mr. 
Robot” share both a director and 
similar themes, namely an interest 
in the fallibility of memory and the 
extent to which corporations have 
their claws in all of us. For months, 
social worker Heidi Bergman 
(Julia Roberts, “Pretty Woman”) 

worked for Geist, a pharmaceutical 
company turned defense contractor 
operating a top-secret civilian 
re-entry program for veterans. But 
years later, when a Department 
of 
Defense 
investigator 
(Shea 
Whigham, “Boardwalk Empire”) 
tracks Heidi down with questions 
about her former job, Heidi can’t 
quite make sense of what really 
happened in her time there.
It’s a subdued role that doesn’t 

give us much of Roberts’s signature 
show-stopping smile, but she brings 
plenty of warmth to it nonetheless. 
And her foray into TV — in line 
with the addition of Meryl Streep to 
the “Big Little Lies” cast and Amy 
Adams’s turn in “Sharp Objects” 
— confirms that we’re in an age 
where prestige TV is as attractive a 
project to Hollywood megastars as 
big-budget film. Roberts is joined 
by an excellent supporting cast — 
Stephan James (“Race”) as Walter 
Cruz, a Geist test subject (ahem, 
client) who develops a rapport 
with Heidi; Sissy Spacek (“Carrie”) 
as Heidi’s concerned mother; and 

Bobby Cannavale (“Third Watch”) 
in the ultimate Cannavalian role, 
Heidi’s sleazy, fast-talking boss 
Colin, who’s in line for a promotion 
at Geist.
The elements that the podcast 
format 
requires 
— 
simple, 
character-driven 
stories 
and 
meaningful dialogue — already 
make 
for 
excellent 
television. 
What’s left for Esmail to do is 
what he seems to do best: elevate 
and 
augment 
the 
storytelling 
with stylish details and artful 
camerawork. With “Homecoming,” 
Esmail solidifies himself as one 
of the best directors working in 
television. His style here projects 
a kind of refined paranoia, evoking 
Hitchcock in hypnotic staircase 
shots, trippy zooms and spectacular 
long takes.
It sounds like a guaranteed 
recipe 
for 
indulgence: 
big 
streaming service meets noted 
TV auteur meets star-studded 
cast. But “Homecoming” is some 
of the smarter, more disciplined 
Amazon fare of late. The half-hour 
format keeps it compact and tightly 
written, watchable from the first 
episode and never a slog. It’s easily 
a model for what streaming shows 
could (and should) be: television 
that makes the most of its creative 
freedom but keeps itself grounded.

W 

hen colleges first began 
to go co-ed about the 
time of the Civil War, 
higher education was still very much 
a man’s game. It wasn’t until 1980, 
nearly 100 years after the start, that 
women and men began to attend 
college at similar rates. Soon enough, 
women began to outpace men in 
terms of attending college and earning 
degrees. As of 2015, 72.5 percent of 
women 
who 
recently 
graduated 
high school were enrolled in college, 
compared to 65.8 percent of men of 
the same demographic. Furthermore, 
women who are enrolled in two-year 
or four-year institutions tend to be 
more successful in their academic and 
extracurricular endeavors.
It is now apparent that American 
women have unprecedented access 
to a college education that was never 
afforded to women of past generations. 
However, despite this access, women 
are still woefully underrepresented in 
academia and beyond. This infuriating 
fact raises the question of why women 
continue to fall behind in leadership 
roles while they earn more degrees.
Historically, 
attending 
college 
was largely reserved for typically 
economically privileged young men 
looking to pursue careers in the fields 
of ministry, medicine or law. As women 
were usually excluded from such 
careers, a college education wasn’t 
practical. As the workforce began to 
diversify, so too did college educations. 
Furthermore, women began to enter 
the workforce in then-unparalleled 
numbers 
as 
American 
society 
underwent the rapid transformation of 
social norms that began during World 
War II. From this point forward, 
women began to work outside of the 
home at much more regular rates. 
Eventually, a college degree became 
essential to be competitive in the 
workforce. This reliance on college 
degrees coincided with the onset of 
second-wave feminism. Also referred 
to as the “women’s movement,” this 
uprising of feminist ideals focused 
largely on gender equality for women 
in work and education. Shortly 
thereafter, women began to attend 
college in rapidly increasing rates, 
eventually rising to the rates they are 
today.
It is wildly apparent that women 
today are more able to attend college 
than ever before. Female college 
students now are more likely to 
have higher grade point averages 
than male students, both when they 
begin and when they finish their 
higher education. Women in college 
also tend to schedule themselves 
more 
aggressively 
in 
terms 
of 
extracurriculars, spend more time 
studying and participate in school-
related activities. However, unlike 

their male counterparts, female college 
graduates are not as likely to encounter 
striking success in their careers of 
choice. For example, despite similar 
levels of education, the gender wage 
gap still persists, with women earning 
between 70 and 90 percent of what 
men do on average in their respective 
fields.
The dearth of female leadership 
in business and politics extends deep 
into other spheres. While women are 
much more likely to be teachers in 
primary and high school settings, this 
trend does not continue into higher 
education. In American universities, 
slightly more than a quarter of full 
professors were women in 2013. In 
terms of leadership positions, women 
fall behind even more so. Women are 
extremely underrepresented among 
senior faculty in many universities. 
A lack of female academics holding 
positions as college deans or university 
provosts contributes to the fact that just 
over 25 percent of university presidents 
were women in 2012. This statistic 
is undoubtedly not representative of 
college student body populations as 
a whole. In colleges and universities 
nationwide, 
women 
represent 
nearly 60 percent of students. Even 
in higher education, where women 
are continually making gains in 
terms of attendance and academic 
success, they still remain woefully 
underrepresented in the leadership of 
their own universities.
In many cases, elite universities 
are among the worst offenders. The 
University of Oxford in the United 
Kingdom, which often boasts its status 
as among the world’s most ancient of 
institutions of higher education, did not 
appoint a female vice-chancellor until 
2016. The University of Pennsylvania 
became the first Ivy League institution 
to appoint a female president in 1994. 
The University of Michigan did not 
have a female president until Mary 
Sue Coleman assumed the role in 2002 
— 185 years after the University was 
founded.
Aside from leadership roles in 
universities, female professors and 
other educators still fall behind male 
colleagues in terms of respect within 
their positions. This is most evident 
in an examination of the academic 
positions women hold within colleges 
and universities. As of 2015, women 
held nearly half of all tenure-track 
positions within universities, but only 
accounted for 38.4 percent of actual 
tenure positions. Similarly, women 
working in academia are more likely 
to hold lower-ranked positions. Female 
academics represent more than half of 
assistant professors and 44.9 percent of 
associate professors, yet also account 
for just 32.4 percent of full professors. 
Of instructor positions, which are 

typically among the lowest ranking 
in academia, women account for 57 
percent. Furthermore, at all faculty 
levels from instructor to tenured 
professor, male academics out-earn 
their female peers. In the 2016-2017 
school year, male full professors 
earned an average salary of $104,493, 
compared to $98,524 for women at the 
same level.
The reasons for these disparities 
are clearly not because women are less 
intellectually capable than men, or any 
less hardworking. Yet, these disparities 
persist nonetheless and permeate into 
fields outside of academia. Women 
are continually underrepresented in 
a multitude of professional leadership 
positions. Just 4.8 percent of CEOs of 
Fortune 500 companies are women, a 
number that has fallen from 2017’s all-
time high of 6.4 percent. In the political 
realm, just 23 current U.S. senators 
(soon to be 24) are women. Despite this 
low number, this is still a record high for 
women in the Senate. In the U.S. House 
of Representatives, just 19.3 percent 
are women, though the percentage is 
expected to grow after the midterm 
elections. Historically, there have only 
been 39 female governors in the U.S. As 
a demographic, women, who comprise 
50.8 percent of the U.S. population 
and who are more highly educated 
than they have ever been, are still 
represented by governing bodies that 
are overwhelmingly male-dominated.
In the 21st century, women are 
undoubtedly 
experiencing 
fewer 
obstacles in the educational field 
than ever before. However, what are 
the tangible effects of this increase 
in higher education? Women as a 
whole have proven they are capable of 
success beyond college, yet few women 
are ever able to obtain such success. 
Women still lag behind men in terms 
of pay, political representation and 
leadership in business and education. 
Women now attend college more often 
than men do, yet they are less likely to 
be taught by female full professors or 
be led by female university presidents. 
This reality, though, is one that may 
be rapidly changing. In the 2018 
midterm elections, a surge of female 
candidates launched campaigns and 
are changing the political landscape. 
Women continue to attend college 
at unprecedented rates, earning a 
record number of degrees. No matter 
how many women enter office after 
the midterms, or how many female 
university presidents are appointed 
in the near future, women deserve a 
much louder voice in the conversation 
than what is currently being afforded 
to them.

FROM THE DAILY

N

o matter how you slice it, the 2018 midterm elections were historic. 
The next Congress will include the most women ever elected to the 
House of Representatives and the Senate, including the first two 
Muslim-American congresswomen. Early turnout estimates suggest that 
Tuesday’s turnout blew all previous midterms out of the water, an encouraging 
sign of rising voter enthusiasm and waning political apathy. Here in Michigan, 
voters approved two pro-democracy ballot proposals by wide margins that 
will prevent partisan gerrymandering and make voting easier for all Michigan 
residents. All of these are encouraging signs of a healthy electorate, despite 
President Donald Trump’s continued attacks on democratic values.

Yet Tuesday’s elections also 
showcased the dark side of 
American democracy in 2018. 
Voter suppression served as a 
major overtone throughout the 
Georgia 
gubernatorial 
race, 
where Republican candidate 
Brian Kemp also served as 
the chief election official for 
his own race in his role as 
Georgia 
secretary 
of 
state. 
Refusing to step down from his 
position during the election, 
Kemp 
slashed 
voter 
rolls 
using an exact match law that 
predominantly removed Black, 
Latinx and Asian voters from 
the rolls — echoing the state’s 
dark history of suppressing 
Black 
voters. 
But 
these 
barriers to casting a ballot 
were not specific to Georgia. 
Across the nation, long lines, 
insufficient 
equipment 
and 
general chaos plagued polling 
centers, potentially serving as a 
deterrent for those with a busy 
schedule seeking to cast their 
vote. Even in Detroit, some 
would-be voters left polling 
places after waiting hours for 
outdated voting equipment to 
receive maintenance. A healthy 
democracy requires maximal 
election 
participation. 
The 
hurdles placed in front of 

voters Tuesday only suppressed 
democratic ideals.
Though 
these 
obstacles 
to voting were widespread, 
Democrats still managed to 
fare quite well in many of the 
districts won by Trump in 2016. 
By ignoring Trump’s racist 
dog-whistling about a caravan 
from Central America, they 
achieved success by focusing 
on a consistent message of 
improving 
health 
care 
and 
policies that would benefit all 
Americans. This tactic worked 
favorably 
for 
Democrats, 
especially those seeking to 
flip 
suburban 
communities. 
However, 
they 
still 
have 
ways to go in appealing to 
working-class voters in rural 
areas. Given Trump’s overall 
popularity, and the impact his 
trade policy has had on rural 
communities, we would have 
hoped Democrats could have 
turned many of these districts 
blue. Despite this, Democrats 
should 
not 
abandon 
these 
districts and instead strive 
for a more unifying message 
that plays well in both suburbs 
and rural areas before the 
2020 campaign. Further, the 
barriers to voting revealed 
during this election call for a 

more fervent push from the 
new Democratic House to put 
election reform at the top of 
the agenda. We hope that pro-
democracy measures, such as 
proposed packages to mandate 
independent 
commissions 
to 
draw 
congressional 
districts and reforming the 
congressional 
ethics 
code 
become 
priorities 
for 
both 
newly elected lawmakers and 
incumbents. Efforts to combat 
voter suppression as well as 
a strategy to listen and take 
into account the needs and 
sentiments of rural America are 
vital for Democrats.
Though this election cycle 
has 
concluded, 
the 
energy 
we’ve seen cannot dwindle. 
We hope voters do not let 
the mixed results of 2018 
discourage them from voting in 
the future. We’re thrilled to see 
the enthusiasm this election 
turned out on campus, and hope 
that it keeps college students 
permanently engaged. As many 
close elections this cycle have 
shown, every vote counts. Don’t 
let complacency get the best of 
you. Continue to stay educated 
on the issues confronting our 
nation and ensure your voice is 
heard at every opportunity.

I

f you have never been to 
or do not plan on visiting 
Northern Michigan during the 
summertime, then you have never 
lived, nor do you truly ever plan 
to. I have experienced the timeless, 
suave waters of Michigan that are 
extraordinary in their own respect 
and are only a part of Michigan’s 
breathtaking nature that keeps its 
inhabitants here year-round. I recall 
the crystal blue water that you can see 
shimmering within the vast expanse 
of Lake Huron, while standing only 
steps away from the shore on the rocks 
surrounding Mackinac Island. You 
can feel the chill of Lake Michigan 
just viewing it from the sand dunes, 
remembering the Legend of the 
Sleeping Bear as you see the silhouettes 
of the North and South Manitou 
Islands contrasting the setting sun. You 
can feel the essence of a land defined by 
water. It’s never going to be the place 
for everyone, but it will forever be the 
roots of those lucky enough to call it 
home.
We stay here because we’ve been 
raised to appreciate the natural 
beauty Michigan gives throughout 
each season. This beauty has been 
prioritized and maintained by the 
Michigan Department of Natural 
Resources 
and 
Department 
of 
Environmental Quality — agencies 
of the state of Michigan that manage 
the use of natural resources within 
state parks, for recreation and in 
industry. Specifically, the protection 
of Michigan’s water resources has 
been the subject of the Michigan 
Water Strategy, a 30-year plan created 
by the Michigan Office of the Great 
Lakes in collaboration with other 
departments to sustain Michigan’s 
globally unique water heritage. The 
plan addresses several demands 
from the government and the people, 
some of which include restoring 
and protecting aquatic ecosystems, 
investing in water infrastructure and 
building governance tools to address 
future problems that surface with 

Michigan’s water resources. While 
this strategy specifically aims to 
address the forefront environmental 
and economic concerns we have for 
the Great Lakes, it also pertains to the 
quality of Michigan’s remaining water 
bodies by nature.
Though the Office of the Great 
Lakes is responsible for carrying out 
the objectives of the water strategy, 
the actions of this group within the 
Department of Natural Resources 
is influenced by the department’s 
director, which is appointed by 
Michigan’s governor. With a 53.3 
percent 
majority, 
Democratic 
candidate Gretchen Whitmer was 
elected Michigan’s newest governor 
on Tuesday. As a person who is 
wholeheartedly invested in using 
practical methods to improve the 
environment and ensure its quality 
remains at the forefront of our 
lifestyles, I am elated to know that 
she has assumed this government 
position that directly influences the 
workings of the department with the 
capacity to progress our environment. 
While there are always logistics of a 
politician’s stance that are questioned 
by opponents or skeptics, her general 
mindset for the environment should be 
argued as our best ticket to a brighter 
future for the Great Lakes and other 
encompassing natural settings.
In 
particular, 
Whitmer 
has 
expressed her dissent toward the 
continuation of Enbridge’s Line 5 in the 
Great Lakes due to the potential risks 
that it poses to water quality. Several 
recent cases have demonstrated the 
pipeline’s questionable durability and 
its susceptibility to the mechanisms of 
other methods of water transportation. 
For instance, a vessel that contributed 
to the mineral oil spill in the Straits of 
Mackinac due to an anchor strike in 
April 2018 is believed to be the same 
vessel that created three small dents 
in Enbridge’s pipeline, forcing it to 
shut down until it could withstand 
sufficient 
pressure 
after 
repair. 
While no catastrophe occurred in 

this scenario, Whitmer sees that it 
is only a matter of time before the 
risk of an oil leak or spill in the Great 
Lakes becomes reality and that the 
people who are served by the pipeline 
are not exactly the ones who will 
suffer the consequences. She has also 
expressed dedication toward finding 
solutions to Michigan’s other water 
crises, admitting the reprehensible 
failures of the government that led 
to the crisis in Flint and failures of 
managing contamination sites that 
led to the outbreak of polyfluoroalkyl 
substances.
In addition to her intention to 
address the broad goals outlined 
by the water strategy, Whitmer 
also plans to focus on innovative 
freshwater 
transportation 
and 
infrastructure, statewide education 
on water economies and natural 
resource 
conservation 
with 
the 
EPA’s Department of Great Lakes 
and Freshwater and the U.S. Climate 
Alliance. She believes in the sheer 
power of collaboration when it comes 
to accomplishing the necessary steps 
toward protecting our waters and our 
ecosystems: “We can’t unilaterally 
control 
the 
federal 
government, 
but what we can do is get every 
congressional member and every 
governor of all the Great Lake states 
and all the states that rely on the Great 
Lakes and create a caucus that will 
have some might. Because every time 
Donald Trump introduces a budget 
that cuts oversight funding for our 
Great Lakes, we need to be active, 
rolling up our sleeves.” With Governor-
elect Whitmer showing determination 
and focus on the quality of our water, I 
trust that her intentions for the Great 
Lakes will translate to the various 
other environmental components that 
make up our gift of a home, and we 
will stay because she will uphold these 
values that define us.

Reflections on the midterms


working 
conditions 
that 
factory workers in China were 
susceptible to. In an interview 
with Racked, Aflalo said, “I 
also went to China to visit a 
factory, and I had this moment 
where I realized this is really 
a polluted environment … I 
started to make the connection: 
This is me, I’m making clothes 
and I’m a big part of this.” She 
soon left Ya Ya and started 
Reformation in 2009. In the 
beginning, 
the 
company 
practiced 
sustainability 
by 
solely 
refurbishing 
vintage 
dresses 
they 
purchased. 
However, as they expanded, 
they 
were 
able 
to 
buy 
sustainable materials to make 
their own original clothing. 
Now, 
Reformation 
prides 
itself on making sustainable 
clothing 
out 
of 
previously 
produced deadstock (clothing 
that was never sold or used by 
customers), carefully selected 
fabric and repurposed vintage. 
The company itself is very 
transparent about the clothing 
they 
produce. 
Each 
piece 
online provides information 
regarding its carbon and water 
footprints so customers truly 
get to see the difference they 
make in the environment by 
purchasing reformation versus 
clothing from a standard retail 
company. For example, the 
RefScale for the Barb Top is 
labeled as having 9.0 pounds 
in carbon dioxide savings, 1.0 
gallons of water savings, and 
1.1 pounds of waste savings. 
Patagonia 
is 
another 
sustainable clothing company 
that 
stands 
out 
in 
the 
transparency 
they 
exercise 

with 
their 
customers. 
On 
their 
website, 
Patagonia 
openly discusses the journey 
that their company has taken 
regarding their transitioning 

to 
increasingly 
sustainable 
materials. In their clothing, 
Patagonia solely uses recycled 
polyester and 100% organic 
cotton 
that 
they 
produce 
themselves without pesticides. 

Patagonia’s 
sustainability 
efforts are initiated by their 
customers’ existing passion 
for nature. This is why they 
also actively play a role in 
environmental campaigns that 
the company itself is passionate 
about, such as protesting dams 
in the South American region 
of Patagonia. Furthermore, the 
website provides information 
on 
grassroots 
campaigns 
all over the country that 
Patagonia 
supports, 
which 
work to alleviate the damage 
of climate change.
Beyond 
Reformation 
and 
Patagonia, there are other 
companies that are also well-
known 
sustainable 
options 
such as Alternative Apparel, 
Amour Vert, DL 1961, Eileen 
Fisher, 
Everlane, 
PrAna, 
Threads 4 Thought and Tribe 
Alive. 
With sustainability comes a 
higher price. But, if the amount 
of sustainable clothing options 
are increased, the demand will 
decrease and price will fall. 
Therefore, in the meantime, 
we must support sustainable 
brands and purchase vintage 
when looking to save money.
We 
are 
all 
guilty 
of 
sustainable 
ignorance 
and 
steps must be taken to deter 
the irresponsibility revolving 
around the fashion industry. 
Clothing 
companies 
should 
feel inspired by the widespread 
success of Reformation and 
Patagonia and look to these 
companies 
as 
an 
example 
to model themselves after. 
Climate change is not waiting 
and neither should we. 

If Tim Burton and Sam 
Raimi had a child, and they 
raised that child on nothing 
but LSD and Pink Floyd’s Dark 
Side of the Moon, that child 
could feasibly grow up to direct 
“The Nutcracker and the Four 
Realms,” a film so wild in its 
every creative decision that 
it almost succeeds through 
sheer ridiculous force alone. 
At different moments, it recalls 
any number of films, from “The 
Chronicles of Narnia” to “The 
Wizard of Oz” to “The Santa 
Clause 2,” but it more often than 
not dances away to another 
lunatic sequence before you 
can put your finger on what 
it’s causing you to remember. 
If we were to judge the film on 
the number of jaw-dropping 
“WTF” moments alone, this 
newest 
“Nutcracker” 
might 
earn a pass.
Unfortunately, 
we 
must 
also judge it by the characters 
and their uniform flatness, 
the underdeveloped story and 
performances that are, more 
often than not, memorable for 
all the wrong reasons. This 
doesn’t include star Mackenzie 
Foy (“Interstellar”) who leads 
the film as Clara, a young girl 
who finds herself whisked away 
to the magical land of the Four 
Realms while trying to unlock 
a mysterious box left to her by 
her late mother. Where so much 
of “The Nutcracker” relies on 
strange gimmicks and visual 
splendor to keep its audience’s 
attention, 
there’s 
genuine 
emotion and charm to Foy’s 
performance that keeps her 
watchable.
The rest of the cast, however, 

is best summed up by Keira 
Knightley’s 
(“Collateral 
Beauty”) turn as the Sugar Plum 
Fairy, the leader of the Land of 
Amusements. As with the rest 
of “Nutcracker,” Knightley’s 
performance is so bizarre that 
it nearly works — at the least, 
you’re kept wondering why she 
thought that voice was a good 
idea in the first place and why 

no one stepped in to tell her she 
sounds like Moaning Myrtle 
on helium — but as with the 
rest of “Nutcracker,” there’s 
nothing underneath to keep it 
interesting. She’s not funny or 
complex, and the dramatic turn 
her character winds up taking 
is completely unearned.
Similarly 
weak 
writing 
abounds, as even Clara falls 
prey to an arc that doesn’t 
change her so much as it affirms 
what we already knew about 
her. She begins “Nutcracker” 
as an inventive young woman 
confident in her mechanical 
skill, and for all the story’s talk 
about using what makes her 
special, she never wavers in that 
confidence. If she is meant to be 
recovering from her mother’s 
death, the closest thing to an 

alternative arc we’re given, 
then there’s no focus lent to 
that goal. It’s a forced “believe 
in yourself” lesson that’s never 
convincing for all Foy’s talents 
and is communicated in the 
same way as “Kung Fu Panda” 
virtually verbatim.
The one stalwartly good 
aspect is the visuals. While 
the effects will likely date 
themselves 
within 
a 
few 
years, the production design 
is breathtaking from top to 
bottom and there are a couple 
smart visual homages to other 
films, including a beautiful 
send-up to the “Toccata and 
Fugue in D minor” segment 
of “Fantasia.” Some of the 
costumes are sillier than others 
— Richard E. Grant (“Can You 
Ever Forgive Me?”) looks like 
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Mr. 
Freeze worked him over with 
a lead pipe and Eugenio Derbez 
(“Geostorm”) looks like a Fox 
News anchor’s idea of what will 
happen if you smoke pot even 
once — but for the vast majority 
of 
“Nutcracker,” 
they’re 
ravishing.
The rest of “The Nutcracker 
and the Four Realms” must 
rely on its oddness to make it 
work, and while scenes of Keira 
Knightley eating the cotton 
candy that grows in place of her 
hair are certainly interesting, 
they hardly make it watchable. 
For that, it must rely on what 
actually counts — the story, 
the characters, the themes — 
yet in all these areas, the film 
is 
lacking. 
Maybe 
younger 
audiences 
will 
gravitate 
towards the bright colors and 
quirky characters, but that 
kind of surface-level enjoyment 
only lasts until the next movie 
that relies on those exact same 
things.

FILM REVIEW

BTBU: Chiang’s ‘Stories 
Of Your Life And Others’

One side effect of coming late 
to everything is that I have a lot 
of submerged influences; my 
past resembles a neglected attic. 
I’m always surprised when my 
friends can see themselves as 
somehow continuous with who 
they were at age 14, like they 
haven’t experienced the kind of 
abrupt, dizzying turnaround I 
did when I left adolescence and 
stumbled into adulthood. I still 
sometimes 
remember 
vague 
hints of my experiences, but my 
memories usually feel like they 
happened to someone else. My 
conception of my past is both 
gallingly calcified and shifting, 
amorphous, as if hidden behind a 
curtain blowing in the wind.
One 
thing 
I 
can 
clearly 
remember from my childhood 
and preteen years is how much 
I read. I was not precocious, and 
my taste was conventional. I 
read the “Eragon” trilogy, every 
“Harry Potter” book, “The Lord 
of the Rings,” et cetera — the kind 
of narrative fiction that the reader 
lives in, at once comfortingly 
Manichean and vibrant. I think 
it was this desire for built worlds 
that led me to also spend a 
great amount of time immersed 
in 
popular 
science 
books, 
especially the large, illustrated 
coffee-table kind, usually about 
space. The workings of faraway 
stars felt both fantastical and 
fundamental, grounded in some 
kind of self-consistent celestial 
logic. I didn’t really understand 
anything I was reading, I just 
wanted somewhere to go.
My mom, a science fiction 
author and editor, lent me 
her autographed copy of Ted 
Chiang’s 2002 anthology “Stories 
of Your Life and Others” when I 
was somewhere in middle school. 
She might have been prompted 
by my entirely aesthetic interest 
in science and technology, but 
I also recall that she mentioned 
the book on more than one 
occasion as one of her favorites. 
The stories were unlike anything 
I had ever read before, and I 
remember being shocked by their 
energetic, yet concise structures. 
As I grow into what she calls 
“literary fiction,” I find that the 
collection is one of the only books 
we still have in common. When I 
revisited it a few weeks ago, I was 
just as surprised by it as when I 

had first read it. For a moment, 
I seemed to be seeing out of my 
younger self’s eyes, experiencing 
the stories’ wonder anew. 
Chiang’s day job is a software 
engineer, which is arguably the 
cultural role that the Medieval 
monk and later the Renaissance 
alchemist occupied previously 
— the universal chroniclers, 
arbiters 
and 
discoverers. 
Software engineers now create 
entire 
worlds 
from 
scratch, 
building the Borgesian map over 
our shared reality. More than one 
story invokes ancient engineers, 
alchemists and scholars as stand-
ins for the cultural role of the 
creative programmer. One story, 
“Seventy-Two Letters,” places 
the ancient Jewish myth of the 
Golem — an automaton that is 
activated by a slip of paper with 
a “name” on it — in a rapidly 
industrializing 
19th-century 
context. Chiang’s stories operate 
by the logic of the Golem — his 
stories read like little literary 
automatons, put into play by 
their own mechanical logic. He 
juxtaposes the tower of Babylon 
myth 
with 
contemporary 
cosmological speculation, he uses 
a specific linguistics problem to 
investigate free will, he brings a 
parable about attractiveness and 
charisma to jarring conclusions. 
In his laser focus on extremely 
specific ideas, he doesn’t lose the 
capacity to surprise. If anything, 
it’s his relentless drive to reach 
the logical conclusion of his 
assemblages that, more often 
than not, makes the stories feel 
so strange and surprising.
Rereading 
the 
anthology 
reminded me of my past fixation 
with technology and logic as 
ends 
in 
themselves. 
Chiang 
creates with his stories a feeling 
I usually associate with finally 
grasping a complicated math 
problem — the joy of consistency 
(perhaps sharing an affinity with 
the German term Funktionslust). 
I frequently forget that I came 
close to majoring in computer 
science — I used to be so much 
more attracted to this feeling 
of 
completeness, 
of 
making 
things work. The more subtle, 
incomplete affects I revel in now 
came later. Chiang’s stories serve 
as sort of a bridge between those 
two versions of myself, rendering 
my past mental life in terms that 
I can understand now.
The 
anthology 
also 
gave 
my present self two stories 
that reminded me of what I 

dislike about this mentality. 
“Understand” and “The Evolution 
of Human Science” both have 
an unfortunate fixation with 
superhuman intelligence that 
posits a positivist, quantifiable 
vision of intelligence, and even 
of personality, that I now find 
narrow-minded. 
“Understand” 
follows a brain-damaged patient 
treated with a neuroregenerative 
drug. When he finds himself 
mentally 
“enhanced” 
beyond 
the 
capabilities 
of 
ordinary 
humans, he spends the rest of 
the story basically marveling 
at the “gestalts” he is able to 
grasp that “ordinaries” don’t. 
It’s frustrating to read lines 
like “The quotidian patterns of 
society are revealed without my 
making an effort,” and it’s a little 
embarrassing to think of what 
the 16-year-old version of me 
would have thought of that line. 
It’s hard to deny that even the 
better stories exist in the cultural 
space also occupied with Neil 
DeGrasse Tyson, TED talks and 
XKCD. This affinity was invisible 
to me on first read but painfully 
obvious when I revisited the 
collection.
Even so, Chiang manages to 
hover over the self-satisfaction 
of the other fabulists of STEM, 
using speculation like a wedge to 
crack reality open in unexpected 
ways rather than falling into 
received notions of progress 
and the universal utility of 
science. The true connection 
between Chiang’s work and the 
contemporary culture of STEM 
lies less in tone than content — 
Chiang is satisfied with a working 
concept rather than a working 
plot, and his stories primarily 
serve the ideas they grow from 
rather than their characters. It’s 
this, rather than his ability to 
interrogate through fiction, that 
I think I have outgrown since the 
first time I read it.
I think what I ultimately 
learned 
initially 
from 
the 
collection 
was 
that 
fiction 
was capable of changing the 
way I thought about things. In 
speaking the language I then 
understood and then breaking it 
apart, the anthology changed the 
way I thought about writing in 
general in a way that I wouldn’t 
realize until much later. I now 
ascribe the ability to create and 
destroy worlds to language, and 
this belief has its roots in this 
unlikely collection of stories.

Sustainable clothing. The

— has the item been made 
with organic cotton? Is it

Reformation, two of the most

companies, are known most 
for their style and high quality. 
Considering how important 
reversing (or slowing) climate

of our way of life and lives, 
sustainable 
clothing 
should 
be widespread and become a

The textile industry is the 
second largest polluter in the 
world after only oil. Fashion’s 
carbon 
footprint 
includes 
the pesticides used in the 
production of cotton and other 
fabrics, the toxic dyes that 
are used and then incorrectly 
discarded, as well as the 
significant amount of pollution 
generated in the processing 
and shipping of garments. In 

basic terms, the cotton t-shirt 
you’re wearing from whatever 
unnamed retail store played 
a role in melting an ice cap. 
It is time that other clothing 
companies take note of what 
sustainable brands are doing

This year shouldn’t be about replacing Flaherty
I

t definitely felt odd.
Last week, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team 
defeated Findlay in an exhibition. 
And for the first game in a long 
time, the name Katelynn Flaherty 
wasn’t announced emphatically, 
over and over again throughout 
Crisler Center.
But as odd as 
it was, it might 
not be a bad 
thing.
Entering this 
season, there’s 
been ample 
talk about 
how and if the 
Wolverines 
will be able 
to replace 
Flaherty, who 
graduated last spring. Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico brought 
this to light just a few minutes into 
the team’s Oct. 10 media day.
“I’m sure the question of the day 
will be, you know, where do we 
go without Katelynn Flaherty?” 
Barnes Arico said. “And how is 
our team going to look without the 
program’s all-time leading scorer?”
It’s an understandable question 
to have. After all, Flaherty led the 
Wolverines in scoring the last four 
years. She was a true playmaker 
and certainly wrote a chapter of 
the school’s history.
Players like Flaherty rarely 
come around, and to be frank, 
the Wolverines don’t have what 
it takes to replace her right now. 
Yes, they have a talented point 
guard in freshman Amy Dilk, who’s 
ready to contribute right away. 
And while she may develop into a 
dominant, Flaherty-esque player 
down the line, right now she’s 
only a freshman. Thus, it’s naive to 
expect her to be Michigan’s savior 
this season.
But maybe the Wolverines don’t 
need a savior; maybe they don’t 
need to replace Flaherty. In fact, 
I’d argue that they shouldn’t try to 
replace her.
Even with Flaherty — and all 
of her dominance — the program 
only qualified for the NCAA 
Tournament once in the last four 
years, just to get trampled in the 
second round by then-No. 2-seed 
Baylor.
Now I’m not saying that the 
team accomplished nothing with 
its star player, because it certainly 
found success. Two seasons ago, 
Michigan won the Women’s 

National Invitation Tournament 
and hung its first banner. The team 
frequently spends time in the top-
25 rankings. Last season, it even 
notched signature wins against 
then-No. 8 Ohio State and then-No. 
13 Maryland.
However, let’s not forget about 
the bludgeonings this team took 
against top teams last season. 
Against then-No. 5 Louisville, 
Michigan went into halftime with 
a five-point lead only to lose by 25. 
The Wolverines had no answer 
for then-No. 3 Notre Dame — 
who went on to win the National 
Championship — or Baylor either, 
and suffered similar fates.
Let’s not forget Michigan 
held a 16-point lead against an 
average Purdue team, only to lose 
in overtime, and how the loss 
spurred a bad stretch in which the 
Wolverines lost four out of five 
games. Although they did end up 
making the NCAA Tournament, 
that slump significantly 
jeopardized the team’s chances at 
the time.
And let’s not forget the Big Ten 
Tournament disappointment, when 
the Wolverines got bounced in 

their second contest by Nebraska. 
Yes, the Cornhuskers were a better 
seed, but it was a game Barnes 
Arico’s squad could have and 
should have won.
All this is to point out that 
even in Flaherty’s senior year, the 
program was far from perfect. That 
shouldn’t be the standard. That 
shouldn’t be Michigan’s ceiling.
This program still has far 
more to accomplish. It has yet to 
truly establish itself as a national 
contender — as a force to reckon 
with.
But now, the Wolverines have 
the tools to do so.
A quick glance at the roster 
is all one needs to recognize 
the potential of this program. 
Michigan has seniors Hallie Thome 
and Nicole Munger — a duo that 
has already proved itself and will 
be key this season.
Then there are players such as 
junior Akienreh Johnson as well 
as sophomores Hailey Brown and 
Deja Church. They all flashed 
glimpses of their talent at various 
points last season and could make 
big strides moving forward.
But to top it off, Michigan has 

one heck of a freshmen class — on 
paper at least. Composed of a five-
star recruit in Dilk — as well as 
three four-stars and a three-star 
— the group was ranked No. 12 by 
ESPN. It’s the program’s all-time 
best recruiting class.
Lack of depth has been an issue 
in the past, because when a team 
only has a small rotation, the 
season becomes more physically 
demanding and takes its toll. It’s 
one reason the Wolverines often 
face the end-of-season slump.
But depth shouldn’t be an issue 
this year.
“I think the thing that we have, 
that we haven’t had since I’ve 
been here,” Barnes Arico said, “is a 
tremendous amount of depth.”
Fans can’t blame Michigan’s 
offense too much for revolving 
around Flaherty the last four years. 
When a team has top-caliber talent, 
it has to use it to its advantage.
That said, an offense becomes 
predictable when it uses only 
one weapon. This season, while 
many players have potential to 
contribute, none are set to garner 
all the attention like Flaherty did. 
Thus the Wolverines can use a 

more diverse attack, which may 
fare better against opponents.
“Definitely missing Katelynn is 
a huge — I don’t know what to call 
it — but it creates a huge deficit for 
the points. I mean, she averaged a 
lot and she contributed a lot to our 
scoring,” Brown said after practice 
on Oct. 22. “But with our team, I 
think now the floor will be open 
more because we have more people 
that are scorers.”
There’s a saying that if it ain’t 
broke, don’t fix it. I’d like to create 
my own saying: if it ain’t perfect, 
don’t replace it.
The mindset for this team should 
not be about replacing Flaherty; 
that’s too tall of a task, and the 
team wasn’t flawless with her.
Instead, the program’s focus 
should be about taking the next 
big step and competing with the 
powerhouses.
And with a roster filled with 
potential, Barnes Arico has 
the threads to strengthen the 
underlying fabric of the program 
and take it to the next level.

Long before former Philadelphia 76ers general manager Sam 

Hinkie asked his devout fan base and the inquisitive media to “trust 
the process,” Nicole Munger had already been applying that mantra to 
her basketball career.

Just an hour north of the Wells Fargo Center, Munger was entering 

her freshman year at Central Bucks High School West in Doylestown, 
Penn. Despite having a local reputation for being athletic, she was 
merely 5-feet tall. But what might have been a disadvantage in most 
people’s eyes was a source of motivation.

“She was about 4-foot nothing,” said her dad, Rick. “Most kids, when 

they’re playing sports, develop a skill-set once they’re comfortable with 
their body. Nicole didn’t have that opportunity. She had to develop a 
skill-set and let her body grow into that skill.”

Added her high school coach, Terry Rakowsky: “You could tell 

from the very beginning that she was special … and just how hard she 
worked and how serious she took what she was trying to accomplish. 
And again, she was just tiny. But her energy and just her commitment 
— she just played one way, which was 100 percent all the time.”

During her time as a Lady Buck, Munger worked tirelessly to 

improve her game. She blossomed into one of the state’s best all-around 
players, quickly enhancing that local reputation into something much 
more. Her height was finally catching up to her skill and effort, and 
colleges around the country began taking notice.

As Munger would soon find out, the eventual transition to the 

college game posed even more challenges. Thanks to her Philadelphia-
bred mentality, though, she would be up to the task.

***
Rick Munger had always been an avid Philadelphia sports fan. But 

becoming a father for the first time to newly-born Nicole meant that 
his fandom would have to take a backseat. Or did it?

“When Nicole was born,” Rick said, “I used to watch the Flyers, 

the NHL hockey team, and my wife made a comment to me like, ‘You 
know, once this baby comes, you’re not going to be able to watch this 
all the time.’ And to my wife’s dislike, Nicole would actually lay on my 
chest and watch the hockey games with me and would just love it.”

It turns out Rick didn’t have to sacrifice any of his fandom for Nicole. 

She was as big a sports fan as he was.

Nicole’s love for watching sports quickly turned into a love of 

playing them. Her and her younger brother Ryan would take to the 
streets of their cul-du-sac to join in on games of pick-up basketball, 
baseball, football and even hockey with their neighbors.

Though these games were played for fun, they also served as an 

incubator for Nicole’s competitive nature.

No sport seemed off limits to her growing up. Munger participated 

recreationally in everything from softball to football, and she was good 
at them all.

When her football and soccer schedules conflicted one year, in 

order to keep her on the team, the soccer coach told the Mungers that 
Nicole could forgo practices and just play in the games.

Despite excelling in multiple sports, she really began focusing on 

basketball in sixth grade.

“Basketball kinda just weeded itself out,” Munger said. “I mean, it 

was the sport I was best at. I knew I couldn’t keep playing football with 
the guys and baseball with the guys. Basketball just won out and that’s 
how it became my favorite sport.”

From that moment on, Munger devoted all her time outside of 

school to getting better. It was at this time that she started developing 
her skill-set.

She joined a top-notch AAU program, the Philadelphia Belles, 

during middle school, but was told she’d have to play on the “B-team” 
that season due to her height.

Munger wasn’t satisfied with that. “She said, ‘No, I want to play on 

this team,’ ” Rick said. “ ‘If you don’t want to play me, that’s okay, but 
I’m going to practice with these kids who are better, because I want to 
get better.’ ”

***
The Wolverines offered Munger during her sophomore year of high 

school.

Michigan’s reputation preceded itself, but going into her official 

visit, Munger and her parents were somewhat wary of how far Ann 
Arbor was from southeast Pennsylvania.

She had never been away from home for an extended period of 

time, and the 10-hour drive from Doylestown meant her family wasn’t 
exactly accessible.

If it’s meant to be, though, it’s meant to be.
Munger loved everything about Michigan — the campus, the 

academics and the athletics as a whole.

“I remember that Friday we were just walking around on campus,” 

Nicole said. “I hit my brother on one side, my dad on the other side 
and said ‘This is it.’ Walking on campus there was just a feel. It was 
a football game weekend … it was just different. You could feel 
the tradition. Every building was just beautiful, obviously highly-
renowned academics were something I was looking for … and that’s 
not even talking about basketball.”

Of course, basketball had to be a consideration too. Her tour of 

campus culminated in her visit to Crisler Center, where she sat down 

with Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico. The two hit 
it off.

“I mean besides how gorgeous this place is, I was 

sitting in coach’s office, and she was the only coach 
talking about getting back to Final Fours,” Munger 
said. “It wasn’t just like, ‘Let’s make the tournament,’ 
it was like ‘Let’s get to Final Fours.’ ”

The admiration was mutual. In Munger, Barnes 

Arico — who was just beginning her coaching career at 
Michigan — saw a hard-working and talented prospect. 
To Barnes Arico, Munger was a player who could only 
be an asset to whichever program was lucky enough to 
get her.

“You need players like Nicole Munger in your program 

to be successful,” Barnes Arico said. “And I have valued 
and appreciated that from day one. She’s a special kid.”

The love affair had commenced. After a tremendous 

senior season, in which Munger earned All-State first 
team honors and led the Lady Bucks to a 32-2 record and 
a runner-up finish in the state championship, the four-star 
recruit packed her bags for Ann Arbor.

Her freshman year, Munger struggled to adjust. 

Academically, assignments were coming fast and furious. 
On the basketball court, she was no longer the best player in 
practice. And on top of it all, her support system was 580 miles 
away. Doubt over whether she belonged at Michigan swirled 
around her head.

“Because it’s Michigan,” Munger said. “I never — I just had 

the thought coming in that, ‘What if I don’t make it?’ I don’t 
think I had the confidence that I could play here until partway 
through my freshman year, when I realized, ‘I can do this. These 
kids are better than me, but I’ll get there.’ ”

Munger, having learned from previous experiences, embraced 

the process all over again.

Her mindset switched to making the team better in whatever 

way she could. In practice, she frequently played on the scout team, 
where her main job was pestering star sophomore point guard 
Katelynn Flaherty. Just like before, Munger worked her way up the 
depth chart with grit and commitment. As a top-100 recruit coming 
out of high school, the talent was clearly there, but without her 
unwavering devotion to improvement, her freshman season would 
not have gone as well as it did.

She appeared in 34 games that year, primarily coming in to play 

pressure defense and hit the occasional 
outside shot on offense. She may have 
averaged just 4.7 points and 2.3 rebounds 
per game, but her contribution went far 
beyond the numbers. 

“She’s a fan favorite,” Barnes Arico 

said. “From the first time she’s ever 
stepped onto the court, people have 
grabbed me immediately after the 
game, ‘Oh my gosh that No. 10, oh my 
gosh, she will just do anything to help 
your team win. She will dive for the 
ball. She will take the charge. She’ll 
be bloodied and try and get up to get 
a stop.’ ”

***
Fast forward to present day, 

and the 5-foot-10 Nicole Munger 
is one of Michigan’s go-to players 
heading into season.

Having lost Flaherty and 

Jillian Dunston from last year’s team — 
which made it to the second round of the 
NCAA tournament — Munger and senior 
forward Hallie Thome have assumed 
leadership roles, both on the court and off it.

“Hallie and I have really been working 

with the team just on the culture,” Munger 
said. “And making sure everyone is on 
board. It’s going to be a really big year. It’s 
a really important year for the growth of 
this program and I think we have the pieces 
in place to do something special, which is 
really cool.”

If anybody is suited for a leadership role, 

it’s Munger. Her unbridled effort coupled 
with the fact that she’s earned Academic 
All-Big Ten honors her past two seasons has 
made her a model example for her younger 
teammates.

On the court this season, her role will be 

to complement Thome’s interior dominance 

with a threat from the outside. Munger shot 
40.4 percent from three last season and will 
be looked to even more to provide that threat 
beyond the arc.

“She can shoot the basketball better than 

I believe anybody in the country,” according 
to Barnes Arico. “I have to continually 
remind her of that, because she doesn’t shoot 
the ball enough for my liking, but she is an 
incredible, incredible shooter.”

If she and Thome can successfully mesh 

this season, while also bringing along 
some of the younger stars on the team, 
the Wolverines will be a major factor in a 
relatively unknown Big Ten Conference.

“Going towards the end of the year, one 

of our big things is Michigan (women’s) 
basketball has never won a Big Ten 
Championship so I think that’s one of our 
biggest goals,” Munger said. “It would be 
great to raise a banner.”

***
Munger’s story is not one of an underdog. 

She had been blessed by unusual athletic 
ability at the outset. Instead, her story is 
one of hard work and trust. Without those 
qualities, she wouldn’t be in her current 
position — a valuable player on a Big Ten 
contender.

There is something about Nicole Munger 

and Philadelphia that go so well together. 
As Rick explains, Philadelphia is a unique 
sports market: one where the only thing the 
fans care about is effort.

“Whether you make a mistake or not is 

fine, as long as you’re giving it your all,” Rick 
said. “And I think Nic has sort of picked up 
on that — that’s the way she plays.”

Big Ten Breakdown: Iowa and Maryland the teams to beat

With 
football 
season 
dwindling, there is only one 
thing that can fill the void that 
will be left in the hearts of Big 
Ten fans across the country: 
basketball – and maybe a little 
bit of hockey. 
Coming 
off 
its 
seventh 
straight 20-plus win season 
– the sixth straight under 
coach Kim Barnes Arico – the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team is primed to continue 
its recent success in what 
should be a wide open Big Ten 
race. If Barnes Arico achieves 
another 20-win season this 
year, she will become the first 
Wolverines basketball coach, 
men’s or women’s, to record 
seven-straight 
20-plus 
win 

seasons.
Michigan, which went 10-6 
in the Big Ten and 22-9 overall 
last season, is coming off of a 
sixth-place finish in the Big 
Ten and a second-round exit 
in the NCAA Tournament. To 
reach their goal of the first Big 
Ten title in school history, the 
Wolverines will have to get 
through the likes of defending-
Big Ten champions Ohio State, 
perennial powerhouse No. 9 
Maryland and an up-and-comer 
in No. 13 Iowa. 
Ohio State 
Last 
season: 
Big 
Ten 
champions (13-3, 27-6)
Coming off its conference-
leading 
fifteenth 
Big 
Ten 
championship – its second in 
a row – Ohio State will be in 
a different position from last 
year. It is going to be hard for 

the Buckeyes to move on after 
losing all five starters from 
last season to either graduation 
or transfers, including three-
time Big Ten Player of the 
Year Kelsey Mitchell. In fact, 
just four players return from 
Ohio State’s 2017-18 campaign: 
Waterman (3.5 points per game), 
senior guard Karlie Cronin (0.1 
points per game), junior guard 
Jensen Caretti (2.4 points per 
game) and sophomore forward 
Savitha Jayaraman (0.5 points 
per game). 
The Buckeyes, though, will 
not lack college experience; 
they bring in a plethora of 
graduate transfers – five to 
be 
exact. 
Graduate 
guards 
Carmen 
Grande 
and 
Carly 
Santoro should have the most 
immediate impact – they have 
combined for over 150 starts 

in their collegiate careers and 
scored 11.5 and 12.8 points per 
game last season, respectively. 
Santoro 
also 
averaged 
8.7 
rebounds per game, and Grande 
was second in the nation with 
9.2 assists per game last season. 
Another likely contributor, 
graduate 
guard 
Ashanti 
Abshaw, 
who 
averaged 
17.1 
points per game in her three 
seasons 
at 
Cleveland 
State, 
injured her ACL in late October 
and will be out for the season. 
Ohio State beat Michigan 
96-87 in their lone matchup last 
year and will travel to Michigan 
this season on Jan. 20.
No. 9 Maryland
 Last season: Second-place 
finish in the Big Ten (12-4, 
25-7) 
Since joining the Big Ten 
ahead of the 2014-2015 season, 

the Terrapins held at least a 
share of the Big Ten title in 
each of their first three seasons 
before finishing second in the 
conference last year. 
Maryland 
coach 
Brenda 
Freese, who has been with the 
team since its days in the ACC, 
has led the Terrapins to the 
NCAA Tournament in 14 of 
her 16 seasons in College Park 
– including all four seasons 
since Maryland joined the Big 
Ten. While last year may have 
been seen as a step down for 
the Terrapins, Freese’s squad 
will look to bounce back in a 
big way after losing just three 
players – only one of whom was 
a consistent starter. 
Similar to last year, Maryland 
will place a heavy workload on

Roster Breakdown: ‘M’ replacing Flaherty with 
strong recruiting class and experienced forwards

After 
advancing 
to 
the 
second round of the 2018 NCAA 
Tournament 
last 
year, 
the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team returns a seasoned and 
experienced 
bunch.
Of 
course, 
the Wolverines 
will be without 
Katelynn 
Flaherty 
for 
the 
upcoming 
campaign. 
Flaherty scored 
2,776 points in 
her career, the 
most 
ever 
in 
school history — including the 
men’s program — and 27th all-
time in NCAA history. She was 
also one of just two women in 
NCAA history to hit over 400 
3-pointers in her career (410) 
and she led the team in scoring 

last season with 22.9 points per 
game on 42.3-percent shooting 
from beyond the arc. 
Simply put, Michigan has a 
lot of production to make up. 
However, coach Kim Barnes 
Arico recruited the 12th-best 
class in the nation (the highest-
ranked 
class 
in 
program history), 
infusing 
exciting 
young 
players 
into a lineup that 
also 
features 
experienced 
veterans. 
While 
last year was the 
Katelynn Flaherty 
show, 
this 
team 
has more of a feel 
of an ensemble. 
So, you may ask, who are 
the women that make up this 
year’s squad? The Daily breaks 
down Michigan’s roster for the 
upcoming season:
Guards:
Looking to replace Flaherty’s 

presence, 5-star freshman Amy 
Dilk appears to be more than up 
to the task. Out of Carmel, Ind., 
Dilk has shown tremendous 
poise on the defensive side of 
the ball and possesses fantastic 
vision and a deadly stroke 
from deep. In high school, 
Dilk 
averaged 
17.8 points and 
6.7 assists per 
game and was 
named Indiana’s 
Gatorade Player 
of the Year and 
Miss Basketball.
Joining 
Dilk 
in the backcourt 
is 
sophomore 
shooting 
guard 
Deja 
Church, 
who has returned to her natural 
position after spending time 
as 
Michigan’s 
backup 
point 
guard last season. Church does 
a great job at getting to the 
basket and seems like a surefire 
bet to improve on a freshman 

campaign that saw her average 
7.0 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.8 
assists per game.
Fellow sophomore Priscilla 
Smeenge should also be in line 
to see extended minutes, and 
she should continue to make an 
impact with her 3-point stroke 
after 
knocking 
down 40 percent 
of her attempts 
last 
season 
in 
limited 
action. 
Junior Akienrah 
Johnson 
also 
figures to make an 
impact, especially 
after she scored 
in double figures 
in 
three 
of 
Michigan’s 
final 
six games of the season to help 
clinch a tournament berth.
Rounding out the guards are 
freshmen Danielle Rauch and 
Ariel Young. Young is a 6-foot-
1 guard from Tallahassee, Fla.,

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily
The Michigan women’s basketball team has a talent-laden roster, with a top-15 recruiting class and an experienced frontcourt returning this season.

Who are the 
women that 
make up this 
year’s squad?

junior guard Kaila Charles, 
who averaged 17.9 points per 
game to go with 8.1 rebounds 
per game in 2017-2018. In 
addition to Charles, Freese 
brings in the fifth-ranked 
recruiting class, per ESPN. 
Highlighted by fourth-ranked 
recruit 
forward 
Shakira 
Austin, and another five-
star recruit in guard Taylor 
Mikesell, the Terrapins will 
look for early contributions 
from their freshmen. 
This year’s Maryland team 
is set to be an improvement 
on last year’s team as the 
Terrapins come into the season 
as the early season favorites 
to capture yet another Big 
Ten championship. 
In 
last 
season’s 
bout, 
Maryland beat the Wolverines 
83-70 and will host Michigan 
on Jan. 12. 
No. 13 Iowa 
Last season: Fourth-place 
finish in the Big Ten (11-5, 
24-7)
After 
a 
disappointing 
first-round exit in last year’s 
NCAA 
Tournament, 
the 
Hawkeyes head into the 2018 
season full of motivation and 
experience. 
Iowa 
returns 
four of last season’s starters, 
including the preseason Big 
Ten player of the year, senior 
guard 
Megan 
Gustafson, 
and junior guard Kathleen 
Doyle, 
another 
preseason 
all-Big Ten selection. The 
Hawkeyes, 
however, 
will 
play the first month of the 
season without Doyle, who 
suffered a fractured left hand 
in practice a week ago. In her 
place, Iowa will rely on senior 
guard Tania Davis, who is 
coming off of an ACL injury 
which sidelined her for the 
majority of last season.
Iowa coach Lisa Bluder is in 
her nineteenth season at the 
helm of the Hawkeye women’s 
program and has a record of 
367-210. Seeking her third 
Big Ten championship, Bluder 
has Iowa in the preseason 
rankings for the first time 
since 2014, when it debuted as 
the No. 19 team in the country. 
The 
Hawkeyes 
defeated 
Michigan in their one matchup 
last year, 82-72, and will host 
the Wolverines on Jan. 17 and 
visit Ann Arbor on Jan. 31.

where she helped her high school 
to a 22-2 record and the first 
Final Four appearance in school 
history. Rauch, while small at 
5-foot-8, showed tenacity on 
the glass during her high school 
career at Bishop Ludden in 
Syracuse, N.Y. Rauch averaged 
7.1 boards per game and should 
be a force on the defensive side 
of the ball as well, evidenced by 
her 4.5 steals per game average 
last season.
Forwards:
While the guard spot features 
an influx of youth, many of the 
Wolverines’ 
veteran 
leaders 
can be found patrolling the 
frontcourt. Starting at forward is 
senior co-captain Nicole Munger. 
After shooting 40.4 percent from 
deep last season, Munger returns 
as Michigan’s top threat from 

deep and should be one of the 
team’s top offensive options. Last 
season, she averaged 9.1 points 
per game, and she emerged as a 
leader on the defensive side of 
the ball, averaging 1.1 steals per 
contest.
Joining 
Munger 
in 
the 
frontcourt 
will 
be 
sophomore 
Hailey 
Brown. 
Hailing 
from 
Ontario, Canada, 
Brown 
was 
a 
key 
contributor 
last 
season 
as 
a 
freshman 
and 
should 
return 
strong 
after 
having 
her 
campaign 
cut short by a 
lower leg injury. Before she 
was sidelined, Brown was one 
of Michigan’s key contributors, 
averaging 9.0 points and 5.2 
rebounds per game and shooting 

46 percent from the field.
Junior Kayla Robbins also 
figures to be a fixture despite 
coming off the bench, bringing 
impressive hustle and tenacity 
on the defensive side of the 
ball. While Robbins only played 
11.8 minutes per game in her 
sophomore 
season, she should 
see more playing 
time this year.
Michigan will 
also 
see 
two 
freshmen slot in 
at forward, with 
Emily Kiser and 
Naz 
Hillmon 
likely in line to 
earn 
minutes 
early. 
Kiser 
averaged 21 points 
and 13.4 rebounds as a senior, 
while Hillmon won a gold medal 
with the U18 USA basketball 
team at the FIBA Americas 
Championship, where she shot 

67 percent from the field.
Rounding out the forwards 
are senior Samantha Trammell 
and graduate transfer Taylor 
Rooks, who previously played 
at 
Stanford 
and 
Harvard. 
Trammell should provide a solid 
veteran presence as a senior, and 
Rooks’ successful 
stint 
with 
the 
Crimson, 
which 
saw her earn All-
Ivy 
honors 
in 
her senior year 
with averages of 
12.5 points and 
7.3 rebounds per 
game, should be 
a solid addition to 
the 
Wolverines’ 
front line.
Center:
Michigan only has one center 
on its roster, but she’s arguably 
the team’s most important player. 
Senior Hallie Thome will hold 
down the middle after coming 

off a season where she averaged 
17.4 points and 7.0 rebounds 
per game and earned All-Big 
Ten first team honors. Thome 
will likely be the focal point 
of the offense, and she should 
be a consistent scoring threat 
after scoring over 20 points 
in 13 games last 
season, reaching 
double 
figures 
in all but three 
contests. 
She’s 
also an incredibly 
efficient shooter, 
converting 
61.6 
percent 
of 
her 
field goals and 
77.5 
percent 
of 
her free throws 
last 
season. 
Thome 
will 
also be taking on more of a 
leadership role this season, and 
will serve as the Wolverines’ 
captain along with fellow senior 
Nicole Munger.
