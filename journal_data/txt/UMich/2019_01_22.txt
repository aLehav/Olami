More than 1,000 students and 
Ann Arbor residents filled Hill 
Auditorium on Monday to hear 
keynote speakers principal and 
co-founder of the James and Grace 
Lee Boggs School in Detroit Julia 
Putnam and anti-racism activist 
and writer Tim Wise discuss 
issues of inequality and injustice 

in America.
The keynote memorial lecture 
is just one event in a two-week 
series of discussions, forums and 
events honoring Martin Luther 
King Jr. and his efforts in the civil 
rights movement.
The 
event 
began

a 
performance from Mosaic Youth 
Theatre before transitioning to 
remarks from Robert Sellers, vice 
provost for equity and inclusion 

and chief diversity officer, as 
well as Scott DeRue, dean of the 
Ross School of Business. DeRue 
introduced University of Michigan 
President Mark Schlissel.
Schlissel said the symposium is 
one of the largest events honoring 
Martin Luther King Jr. in the 
country. He commended the work 
of the event organizers in his 
speech.
“We’re 
proud 
that 
the 

University of Michigan Martin 
Luther King Jr. Symposium is one 
of our nation’s largest university 
celebrations of the life and legacy 
of Dr. King,” Schlissel said. “It 
reflects our desire to serve society 
and strive for a better, more 
equitable, more just and more 
peaceful world.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Approximately 
300 
protesters marched near the 
entrance of Cobo Center on 
the first night of the North 
American International Auto 
Show in Detroit on Friday. 
Protesters came to support 

causes including the Green 
New Deal and the prevention 
of the General Motors plant 
closures.
The 
Green 
New 
Deal, 
most notably proposed by 
U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez, D-N.Y., is a proposal 
aimed at addressing both 
climate change and economic 

inequalities. Many of the 
signs at the demonstration 
represented this ideal with 
phrases such as, “Green Union 
Jobs Now” and, “Clean Air! 
Clean Jobs! Clean Energy!”
The first night of the auto 
show, before it opens to the 
public, is historically the 
Charity Preview. Attendees 

get the first view of the 
show and are encouraged to 
participate in philanthropic 
activities.
The auto show describes 
the Charity Preview as “One 
of the most exclusive, high 
profile events in the nation.”

About 
300 
students 
and 
faculty attended the 17th Annual 
South Asian Awareness Network 
Conference took place Saturday 
 
at the Michigan League. SAAN is 
a student-run organization at the 
University of Michigan which 
focuses on spreading awareness 
about social justice issues related 
to South Asian communities and 
other communities of color.
The 
conference, 
titled 
“Shifting 
Sands: 
Amplifying 
Stories 
to 
Create 
a 
New 
Narrative,” hosted a variety of 
speakers to discuss social justice 
issues such as sexual and mental 
health, representation in media, 
immigration and transgressing 
gender stereotypes.
SAAN’s vision statement for 
the conference read, “We aim to 
maintain spaces that challenge 
the dominant narrative and 
support those who are not given 
the opportunity to tell their 
stories.”

More than 100 people gathered 
inside Haven Hall for the 13th 
Annual Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day Circle of Unity hosted by the 
Michigan Community Scholars 
Program. 
The event, held in conjunction 
with the University of Michigan’s 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day Symposium, brought 
people together to honor heritage 
and diversity through different 
art forms.
Gabe 
Colman, 
coordinator 
for 
diversity 
initiatives 
for 
the 
Michigan 
Community 
Scholars Program, reflected on 
the significance of the event, 
commenting on how it offers 
individuals an opportunity to 
come together as one in an often 

polarizing time.
“It’s called a ‘Circle of Unity’ 
because we all hold hands and 
get in a circle and that’s not 
something we do every day,” 
Colman said. “That’s what makes 
it special, especially in the world 
we live in now — it’s super divisive 
and polarizing even on campus. 
It’s cool to see people from all 
different walks of life get together 
in the same room and be able to 
be one.”
The event celebrated King’s 
commitment to social justice, 
peace and unity. Participants 
used song, dance and spoken-
word poetry to honor King’s 
legacy. Local musicians Joe Reilly 
and Julie Beutel were featured 
artists at the event, along with 
the Smile Bringer Singers, a club

More 
than 
200 
people 
filled Angell Hall Auditorium 
B on Monday for “Fights 
about Language and Political 
Correctness: 
What’s 
at 
Stake?” The discussion, led 
by Anne Curzan, professor of 
English and associate dean for 
humanities, and linguistics 
professor 
Robin 
Queen, 
addressed the term “political 
correctness” 
and 
what 
it 
means in society today.
The event was a part of 
the University of Michigan’s 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther 
King 
Jr. 
Day 
Symposium. 
In celebration of King, the 
professors reflected on how 
subtle details in everyday 
language 
can 
have 
broad 
social 
impacts. 
Curzan 
began with a reminder that 

individual 
word 
choice 
matters in a society focused 
on maintaining progression 
and positive change.
“Our 
language 
choices 
matter,” Curzan said. “There 
is no language choice that 
is too small to matter. Every 
single one of us has a role in 
the choices that we make, and 
the conscious choices that we 
can make to thereby make a 
more inclusive environment.”
The discussion was based 
on 
three 
central 
themes: 
language 
choices 
matter, 
intention behind words does 
not outweigh interpretation 
and arguments about political 
correctness 
go 
beyond 
language.
Curzan 
defined 
political 
correctness and explained why 
the discussion surrounding it 
is often rife with tension.
“A big part of what we’re 

debating is power,” Curzan 
said. “The power to say what 
words mean, and to say who 
can and can’t use them … One 
of the things happening in PC 
language is that a different 
set 
of 
people 
— 
people 
who have been historically 
marginalized — are getting 
to call more of the linguistic 
shots. That’s what is feeling so 
contested about it.”
Queen commented on how 
the discussion on language 
choice 
can 
be 
used 
in 
conversations pertaining to 
larger social issues.
“A lot of people argue that 
changing language is a trivial 
point of intervention,” Queen 
said. “Maybe, but it’s a place to 
start. That doesn’t mean that 
thinking about language is 
the only thing to do. You can 
think about language and the 
climate at the same time. You 
can think about racism and 
the words of racism at the 
same time.”
Queen reflected on how 
politically correct language 
forces individuals to think 
about their place within a 
larger society and how this 
consciousness 
generates 
more mindfulness.
“How 
can 
we 
be 
respectful 
and 
generous 
to one another — not only 
as speakers, but also as 
listeners?” 
Queen 
said. 
“How can we approach one 
another from a spirit of 
love, of thinking of us all in 
the same boat, all trying to 
figure out the best ways to 
treat each other well? The 
treating each other well 
comes from goodwill on all 
of our parts.”
Curzan 
concluded 
the 
presentation 
with 
a 
reflection 
on 
how 
politically correct language 
is the responsibility of the 
speaker and the listener 
to uphold, adding it can be 
a catalyst for productive 
conversation and greater 

learning.
“We 
have 
to 
take 
responsibility for our words, 
and listen and know that 
these choices matter,” Curzan 
said. “As listeners, we would 
encourage a kind of generosity 
that if someone says something 
that is insulting or offensive, 
is to not assume that you know 
intention. One of the things 
we can do as listeners is to 
say, ‘here’s what I just heard,’ 
because that is true … that is a 
stance that creates more space 
about that. And dialogue is 
how we learn.”
Engineering 
freshman 
Ruben 
Coronel 
echoed 
Curzan’s 
sentiments 
and 
explained 
how 
 
language 
impacts 
individuals 
both 
in 
public 
and 
private 
conversation.
“These kinds of discussion 
are 
important 
to 
raise 
awareness, because a lot of 
people 
do 
not 
necessarily 
take the time to look at the 
way people are represented 
in 
non-public 
settings,” 
Coronel said. “Even if there’s 
a comment that is not as 
out in the open as someone 
making an insensitive remark 
to a newspaper, for example, 
(accurate representation) is 
still just as important.”
After 
the 
speech, 
Simon 
Rivers, 
curriculum 
coordinator for the English 
Language 
and 
Literature 
Department, said discussions 
like this is vital to celebrating 
the memory of King.
“All through our school’s 
years, we always had the day 
off, or there was some sort of 
break there,” Rivers said. “I 
think it is really important 
that we take this day where 
we honor this huge figure 
in American society and are 
either learning, doing some 
sort of service, participating 
in some sort of activism or 
raising awareness so it is not a 
wasteful day.”

A 
Michigan 
congressional 
delegation 
introduced 
a 
bipartisan 
bill 
to 
designate 
per- 
and 
polyfluoroalkyl 
substances, known as PFAS, 
detected across the state as 
hazardous substances, allowing 
the Environmental Protection 
Agency 
to 
direct 
funds 
to 
cleaning up polluted sites.
The 
so-called 
“forever 
chemicals” have been found 
in water sources throughout 
Michigan, 
including 
in 
Ann 
Arbor. Consumption of PFAS 
compounds, even in low levels, 
can lead to health problems, 
affecting the immune system 
and increasing the risk of cancer, 
among other things.
The 
PFAS 
Action 
Act, 

written by U.S. Reps. Debbie 
Dingell, 
D-Ann 
Arbor, 
Dan 
Kildee, D-Flint, and U.S. Rep. 
Fred 
Upton, 
R-St. 
Joseph, 
would allow the EPA to clean 
up sites contaminated by all 
PFAS chemicals as part of the 
Superfund program, a federal 
effort to address pollutants that 
pose a risk to human health or 
the environment.
In 
a 
press 
release, 
the 
lawmakers noted an “urgency 
and need to act” to address PFAS. 
Dingell, whose district includes 
Ann Arbor, said the chemicals 
were a growing problem.
“Michigan has been hit hard 
by PFAS,” Dingell said. “It’s clear 
it’s a threat to human health and 
our environment. It’s been found 
in our drinking water, air, food 
and consumer products. Our 
bipartisan legislation will list all 
PFAS as the hazardous chemicals 
we know they are and give the 
EPA the tools it needs to clean up 

contaminated sites.”
Currently, 
the 
EPA 
does 
not list PFAS as hazardous 
substances 
— 
only 
as 
an 
“emerging 
contaminant.” 
For 
several decades, the chemicals 
in the PFAS family were used 
in 
industrial 
and 
consumer 
products, such as waterproof 
clothing, food wrappers, Teflon 
pans and fire-fighting foam.
According to the Michigan 
Environmental Council, there 
are 36 confirmed PFAS sites in 
the state. However, the Michigan 
Department of Environmental 
Quality estimates more than 
11,300 locations statewide may 
be contaminated.
Brian Steglitz, the manager 
of Ann Arbor’s water treatment 
plant, said part of the problem is 
the compounds are durable and 
do not break down naturally.
“Many, many products that we 
use every day, these chemicals are 
in, and because they’re so stable 

they get into the environment 
when you wash your pots and pans 
and clothes, and the firefighting 
foam can get into a storm sewer,” 
Steglitz 
said. 
“They’re 
very 
persistent. They don’t break down 
very easily, and because of that 
they’re in the watershed, and in 
our particular case they’re in the 
Huron River watershed.”
Ann Arbor has recently seen 
a spike in PFAS levels in its 
drinking water, but Steglitz said 
there were systems in place to 
closely monitor and remove the 
compounds.
“For meeting what the current 
water quality standards are, we 
are doing that,” Steglitz said. 
“We’re actually well exceeding 
what the current standards or 
guidance is for addressing it and 
we’re using the best available 
technology that’s currently on 
the market to remove these 
compounds in the municipal 
drinking water facility.”

The 
EPA 
set 
the 
health 
advisory level for two harmful 
PFAS compounds — PFOA and 
PFOS — at 70 parts-per-trillion 
in 
2016. 
However, 
in 
May, 
Politico reported on a study from 
the Department of Health and 
Human Services that would have 
recommended making the safety 
level for PFAS in drinking water 
six times lower than the existing 
standard that was being held up 
by the Trump administration.
In 
November, 
lab 
tests 
showed a combined PFOS and 
PFOA level of 56.40 ppt in Ann 
Arbor. The next month, tests 
said none of the compounds 
were found. However, because 
of an administrative error at 
the lab contracted to examine 
the samples, the analysis used 
a method with higher limits for 
detection and tested for fewer 
compounds 
than 
requested, 
and failed to meet the city’s 
parameters.

Other Michigan lawmakers 
have 
voiced 
concern 
about 
the chemicals as well. In late 
December, Sen. Gary Peters, 
D-Mich., sent a letter to Andrew 
Wheeler, the acting director 
of the EPA, urging the agency 
to craft a plan for dealing with 
PFAS. Peters asked for swift 
action to address the problem.
“In my state of Michigan, the 
more we look for PFAS the more 
we find,” Peters wrote. “… To 
date, chemicals have been found 
at some level in the drinking 
water serving more than two 
million people around the state, 
and I fully expect that number 
to continue to climb. Dozens of 
contaminated sites are found 
in both the Upper and Lower 
peninsulas, in both urban and 
rural areas.”

After taking part in song and 
dance, the audience had the 
opportunity to publicly express 
their dreams for the future of 
society.

Taubman freshman Demetrius 
Ford discussed how events like the 
Circle of Unity allow individuals to 
come together to celebrate King on 
this memorial holiday.
“MLK was such a pivotal figure 
in our history and in the civil rights 
movement,” Ford said. “His work 
and his contributions expand 
into today. I wanted to be here 
to show my appreciation for him 
and his work, and I also wanted 

to see everybody here together to 
celebrate him.”
Engineering 
freshman 
Sage 
Paris commented on how Mrtin 
Luther King Jr. Day serves as an 
opportunity to reflect on injustice 
in this nation at large.
“It’s still important to come 
to events like this so we can 
acknowledge the significance of 
the day that is Martin Luther King 
Day, and reflect, particularly on 

this day, on the rich history that 
has to do with all of the injustices 
in this country and think about the 
modern relevance of all of the issues 
that we are faced with,” Paris said.
The event concluded with a 
performance of gospel folk song 
“We Shall Overcome,” during 
which audience members came 
together in harmony as a testament 
to their dedication to positive social 
change.

In addition to a lecture by the 
keynote speaker, Trisha Sakhuja-
Walia, CEO and co-founder of 
Brown Girl Magazine, other 
guest speakers presented in 
smaller workshops throughout 
the day.
During her keynote speech, 
Sakhuja-Walia highlighted the 
efforts of Brown Girl Magazine, 
an online publication created by 
and for South Asian women that 
uses stories to build community 
and 
empower 
South 
Asian 
women. The magazine, created 
in 2008, has published more 
than 4,000 original stories, 
reaching more than 5 million 
readers 
spanning 
the 
U.S., 
United Kingdom, India, Pakistan 
and South Africa.
Sakhuja-Walia named topics 
the

covered, 
including

driving force behind her work at 
the magazine.
“Representation 
is 
more 
than just seeing ourselves on 
television or in movies or in 

gigantic 
ad 
campaigns 
and 
billboards,” 
Sakhuja-Walia 
said. “Representation matters 
because 
it 
directly 
impacts 
how minority communities see 
themselves and how others in 
society view them.”
Sakhuja-Walia played clips 
of different media that have 
either portrayed South Asians 
positively or negatively. Sakhuja-
Walia explained, while Anik 
Kahn’s uplifting music video 
“Big Fax,” containing the lyrics 
“damn it feels good to be an 
immigrant,” shed a positive 
light on cultural pride, Apu, the 
cartoon character from “The 
Simpsons,” instilled damaging 
stereotypes in society through 
its offensive portrayal of an 
Indian 
immigrant 
character 
voiced by a white man.
On the topic of the stereotypes 
of minorities in media, LSA 
freshman Emily Wu said the 
underrepresentation of South 
Asians is relatable for other 
minority groups.
“I really liked the media that 
was in (the presentation) … 
because I actually feel that too,” 
Wu said. “I’m Asian but I still 
feel that. It’s very relevant across 
all ethnicities that aren’t white.” 
 
Sakhuja-Walia also used a 
disclaimer in her presentation, 
explaining that doing something 
out of the ordinary or engaging 
in certain actions as a member of 
the South Asian community does 
not make the action right. She 
said the actions of an individual 
belonging to the South Asian 
community don’t represent the 
actions of the whole population.
“Before I dive into some of 
the 
positive 
affirmations 
of 
media representation, I want to 

acknowledge that we are finally 
in a time where doing something 
cool or out of the ordinary just 
because you are South Asian or 
brown doesn’t mean it’s always 
going to be right,” Sakhuja-Walia 
said. “Your actions speak for 
themselves, and the color of your 
skin and cultural affiliation can 
only do so much.”
Sakhuja-Walia 
emphasized 
the importance of continuing 
to share stories to create a more 
inclusive narrative for the South 
Asian community.
“No matter how far we have 
come living as South Asian 
people living in the diaspora, no 
matter how many times we have 
told our story, we will always be 
in the pursuit of storytelling,” 
Sakhuja-Walia said. 
During 
one 
workshop, 
Amit 
Patel, 
a 
dancer 
and 
choreographer based in Los 
Angeles, 
spoke 
about 
his 
personal storytelling through 
dance. 
Patel 
discussed 
his 
experience as a first-generation 
Indian American and his journey 
discovering his identity through 
pioneering a new discipline of 
fusion dance called “Indian 
contemporary”: 
dance 
which 
combines elements of ballet, 
contemporary, modern, jazz and 
traditional Indian movements.
Patel explained the confusion 
he 
experienced 
in 
college 
regarding his identity.
“I was still very confused 
about 
my 
identity,” 
Patel 
said. “Who I was in terms of, 
‘Should I be a little bit more 
Indian? Should I be a little more 
American? What does that even 
mean? What does that entail?’”
In an exploration of his 
identity, Patel said he turned to 

different forms of movement for 
individual expression.
“I was trying to learn more 
about movement and how it 
was more than just a way of 
expression, but a mind, body and 
soul connection,” Patel said. “I 
was able to express all aspects of 
my being through that.”
Patel’s discovery of his identity 
through movement was only one 
of the experiences explored in 
the SAAN conference. Other 
workshop 
speakers 
included 
Jordan Alam, a Bangladeshi-
American writer, performer and 
social change educator; Alicia 
Virani, associate director of 
the criminal justice program at 
the UCLA School of Law; Hiba 
Khan, 
a 
Pakistani-Canadian 
artist; 
Neeraja 
Aravamudan, 
a social justice educator and 
associate director for teaching 
and research at the University’s 
Ginsberg 
Center 
and 
Tazin 
Daniels, an anthropologist and 
advocate for immigration and 
other issues relevant to the 
South Asian experience.
LSA 
junior 
Nikita 
Bazaj, 
small groups chair for the 
SAAN Central Planning Team, 
explained the relevance of SAAN 
at the University of Michigan.
“I think that SAAN is a great 
starting point for a lot of people 
who are looking to start engaging 
with social justice because a lot 
of people hear the term, ‘social 
justice’ and they’re afraid of it,” 
Bazaj said. “And I think that 
SAAN creates an opportunity 
for people to get introduced to 
what it is all about and listen to 
major speakers from minority 
categories that we don’t really 
see represented on this campus 
as often.”

The 
protesters’ 
location 
proved 
to 
be 
strategically 
chosen, as gala invitees strolled 
in black-tie garb and were 
face-to-face with protesters 
who could possibly be laid off 
by GM.
Before the march began, 
U.S. 
Rep. 
Rashida 
Tlaib, 
D-Mich., gave a speech about 
her family’s automotive roots 
and the injustice of the plant 
closure. She urged protesters 
to keep steady in their efforts 
to shed light on one of the GM 
closures.
“Understand 
we 
are 
here 
not 
alone 
with 
the 
Poletown 
workers, 
we 
are 
here to pushback against the 
shutdown of our government,” 
Tlaib said. “We constantly see 
that the CEOs are making 200, 
300, 400 times more than their 
workers. Guess who subsidizes 
it? We do … so we are here to 

stand in solidarity with every 
single worker.”
Later, she told The Michigan 
Daily about the intersection 
between the closure of the GM 
plants and the importance of 
the Green New Deal.
“Know 
that 
even 
GM’s 
closures 
show 
you 
the 
importance of the Green New 
Deal —the fact that we need to 
start looking at creating jobs 
beyond the traditional jobs 
that we’ve seen throughout the 
years,” Tlaib said. “In Detroit 
and around the nation, there 
needs to be real accountability, 
oversight and co-ownership 
when it comes to creating new 
jobs in our country. And the 
Green New Deal provides that 
structure to be able to have 
that.”
Once 
participants 
heard 
Tlaib’s speech, the marchers 
started heading toward the 
entrance, equipped with a 
small marching band. The 
most 
common 
tune 
sung 
during the demonstration was 
a repetitive question: “Which 

side are you on? Which side 
are you on?”
The 
Green 
New 
Deal 
resonates with many young 
activists. 
The 
Sunrise 
Movement has been a popular 
and growing movement in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
is 
particularly aimed at youth 
membership 
to 
prioritize 
climate change action in the 
national 
agenda. 
Members 
support the Green New Deal 
and are heavily involved in 
activism such as sit-ins outside 
of 
government 
officials’ 
offices.
Students 
who 
are 
not 
involved 
in 
the 
Sunrise 
Movement also said they see 
the 
benefits 
of 
large-scale 
environmental policy change. 
LSA sophomore Matt Peracchi, 
who studies in the University 
of Michigan’s Program in the 
Environment, did not attend 
the protest, but said he wants 
more investment in new forms 
of energy.
“Investing 
in 
renewable 
energy is an important first 

step 
towards 
mitigating 
climate change. It isn’t the 
only thing the United States 
and the world needs to focus 
on, 
but 
GHG 
(greenhouse 
gas) emissions from energy 
production is a huge factor 
causing 
climate 
change,” 
Peracchi said.
Many 
protesters 
said 
unionized 
demonstrations 
are 
critical 
to 
creating 
change in workers’ rights. 
Norma 
Jean 
Haynes, 
a 
member of the Democratic 
Socialists 
of 
America, 
talked about the importance 
of getting the workers of 
Detroit to participate in this 
demonstration outside of the 
auto show.
“People talk in Detroit about 
the revitalization, about the 
reclaiming of the city,” Haynes 
said. “And people who have 
lived here want to prioritize 
the workers, so getting people 
on the ground showing the 
vitality of that interest is 
exactly what we are out here 
to do.”

legacy and remembering the 
civil rights movement’s fight 
for racial justice. Other events 
included an MLK Day Circle 
of Unity and a screening of 
the documentary “Race: The 
Power of an Illusion.”
Through gospel songs and 
conversation, 
the 
panelists 
told their individual stories 
and recounted their years of 
nonviolent activism to a crowd 
of more than 100 students, 
faculty 
and 
community 
members.
Countryman said the goal 
of the discussion was to tell a 
more “complicated” story of 
the civil rights movement that 
included women and lesser-
known narratives.
“There is a gap between 
general 
knowledge 
and 
what we can teach in the 
classroom,” 
Countryman 
said. “This is why events like 
this are important: because 
they tell these larger stories 
and present the story of a 
movement that is not coming 
from a few people at the top, 
but only happened because 
there was a larger movement 
at the bottom.”
Noonan, 
who 
graduated 
from 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
in 
1964, 
began 
the talk by noting how her 
involvement in SNCC was 
born both out of necessity 
and personal conviction. She 
said the widespread belief the 
civil rights movement was a 
struggle for increased rights 
for African Americans is not 
entirely truthful.
“We 
were 
fighting 
for 

survival,” Noonan said. “We 
were 
fighting 
against 
the 
white terrorist structure in 
the South, which somehow is 
not captured by the notion of 
fighting for our rights.”
Max 
Grahl, 
an 
LSA 
sophomore 
who 
attended 
the event, said afterwards 
that Noonan’s point made 
him realize the civil rights 
movement was not only about 
ensuring civil rights for all 
Americans, but was vital to the 
future of African Americans.
“I think it’s hard sometimes 
to visualize that this wasn’t 
just a crisis over rights, it 
was a crisis over these people 
trying to live their lives,” 
Grahl said. “It’s something 
that you can forget once you 
become disconnected and it 
becomes history.”
Fikes 
echoed 
Noonan’s 
argument 
by 
mentioning 
how members of SNCC and 
other civil rights activists 
were fully aware that they 
could lose their jobs, homes 
or lives by participating in 
the movement. Fikes, who 
began singing gospel music 
when she was 4 years old 
and 
performed 
with 
the 
SNCC Freedom Singers, said 
singing gave her strength 
to endure mistreatment and 
suffering.
“Can 
you 
believe 
that 
all those old songs that I 
despised so much then, I 
travel the country teaching 
today?” Fikes said. “You must 

understand why I do the 
things I do, why singing is so 
important to me. One of the 
reasons is that it releases me. 
When I have a problem that 
I can’t talk about, I can sing 
about it, whether it’s the blues, 
gospel or whatever.”
Fikes 
urged 
audience 
members to join her in singing 
traditional gospel and folk 
songs that were influential 
during 
the 
civil 
rights 
movement, such as “Keep 
Your Eyes on the Prize” and 
“This Little Light of Mine.” 
She said these songs embodied 
her commitment to fighting 
against 
injustice 
through 
nonviolent protest.
“When I see police coming 
today, 
people 
think 
I’m 
scared of police — no, I’m not 
afraid of police,” Fikes said. 
“I am afraid of the injustice. 
Being a Black woman, I was 
taught in Selma, Alabama, 
what freedom really meant. 
And when we got together, 
our energy was so high that 
when someone asked you a 
question, they said, ‘Whatcha 
want?’ and we would holler, 
‘Freedom!’”
Lowen 
discussed 
her 
involvement 
with 
SNCC 
in addition to her family’s 
personal 
struggles 
as 
European 
Jews 
in 
the 
early 20th century. As an 
undergraduate at Bennington 
College in the 1960s, Lowen 
joined a civil rights group 
and later joined the 1966 
March Against Fear in the 
South. Referencing a photo 
of a Nazi police dog, Lowen 
noted the similarities between 
European anti-Semitism and 
American racism.
“It really struck me that 
this is not a cartoon — this is 
a real dog wearing a real Nazi 
swastika and he was used 
in the same way over there 
that these dogs were used on 
us here,” Lowen said. “This 
picture for me symbolizes the 
powerful connection between 
the situations then and now.”
Noonan noted how many 
women involved in the civil 
rights 
movement 
diverged 
from the typical female ideal 
and took a radical approach 
to 
fighting 
injustice 
by 
embracing the strength of 
other female activists. She 
referred 
to 
Bob 
Dylan’s 
“Maggie’s Farm,” a popular 
protest song, when describing 
her motivation for working 
with SNCC.
“The notion that somehow 
has crept into some of the 
literature 
that 
we 
were 
weaklings, 
oppressed 
by men — it’s not in my 
experience,” 
Noonan 
said. 
“Being a ’60s activist taught 
me to say, ‘I ain’t gonna 
work on Maggie’s farm no 
more.’ In the movement, in 
my school, in my home, the 
movement strengthened me 
and set me free. Like those 
sharecroppers who formed 
tent cities in Haywood and 
Fayette, and later in Lowndes 
County, Alabama, whatever 
happens in the future, I ain’t 
gonna work on Maggie’s farm 
no more. No one and nothing 
is going to keep me from 
letting this little light I have 
shine, shine and shine.”

A

s a born and raised 
Ann 
Arborite, 
I’ve 
always known climate 
change to be real. It’s not 
up for debate in our school 
system. It’s acknowledged 
by 
our 
political 
leaders. 
And it’s even acted upon 
by citizen and government 
alike. However, the sense 
of urgency I’ve felt in my 
20 years on this planet is 
nowhere near an acceptable 
level of effort when it comes 
to taking action on climate. 
It’s as though we’ve patted 
ourselves on the back for 
choosing to care.
My theory is that many of 
us feel safe and that our own 
lives aren’t at risk. Against 
my 
better 
judgement, 
I 
feel this way. When I left 
Michigan 
for 
school, 
I 
didn’t consider whether my 
home would be there when 
I returned, or if it’d weather 
any 
storms. 
Ann 
Arbor 
isn’t facing hurricanes or 
wildfires. And our flooding 
increases don’t compare to 
other catastrophes.
We are privileged and 
lucky.
But 
not 
that 
lucky. 
Anyone who follows the 
Flint water crisis or the 
Enbridge 
Line 
5 
debate 
knows 
that 
our 
water 
infrastructure 
is 
badly 
damaged, 
which 
climate 
change 
can 
only 
make 
worse. Yet, I have spent the 
last few years priming my 
statements 
about 
climate 
impacts with qualifications 
such as “my state will be 
okay, but hurricane season 
is going to get worse.”
I am not the only one who 
does this. I also didn’t think 

it was a problem — we’re 
being 
socially 
conscious, 
aren’t we? But this past 
semester, 
I 
realized 
it 
was. I joined the Sunrise 
Movement in Washington, 
D.C., with a 1000 others 
to demand a Green New 
Deal, a package of policies 
including 
100 
percent 

renewable energy by 2030, a 
federal jobs guarantee, and 
investment in communities 
on the frontlines of poverty 
and pollution. Much like 
President 
Franklin 
D. 
Roosevelt’s New Deal, it 
would take the emergency 
at hand for what it is and 
use 
every 
tool 
available 
to 
address 
it. 
Led 
by 
unapologetic youth leaders 
working to solve the climate 
crisis, I was arrested with 
142 others and hoped it 
would 
sway 
Democratic 
leadership.
It didn’t.
Despite widespread news 
coverage and support from 
a majority of Americans, 
Democrats brushed aside an 
opportunity for substantial 
action and instead revived 
a toothless committee on 

climate. 
The 
Democratic 
Party 
is 
the 
party 
that 
knows climate change is 
real, after all, not the party 
that prioritizes it. However, 
while 
Speaker 
Nancy 
Pelosi can brush aside our 
demands, she cannot sweep 
our spirit under the rug.
When we stood in the 
halls of Congress, telling 
our stories and singing, I 
thought this could actually 
work. That the Green New 
Deal could actually solve 
climate change. I’ve never 
felt emotional about the 
Band-Aid policies proposed 
before. 
The 
Green 
New 
Deal is different. It doesn’t 
start from an assumption of 
what’s politically possible, 
it springs from identifying 
what’s needed.
While 
I 
sat 
in 
zip 
ties, the ways in which 
Michigan 
will 
face 
the 
climate crisis washed over 
me. It might not be as 
dramatic as a hurricane, 
but our access to clean 
water (already threatened 
by oil spills, lead, dioxane 
and PFAS), our crumbling 
infrastructure, agriculture 
and tourism industry are all 
facing uncertain futures. I 
began to see the changes in 
my home for what they are. 
I’ve always known this, but 
I’ve never felt it before. The 
Sunrise Movement gave me 
real hope and opened the 
doors for grief to pour in.

Democrats, resist progressive temptation
D

uring the 2018 college 

football 
season, 

Michigan 
Stadium 

drew 
an 
average 

crowd of 110,737 fans 

per game. That’s a 

lot of folks in maize 

and 
blue, 
and 
a 

greater number than 

Donald 
Trump’s 

2016 
combined 

margin of victory — 

a razor thin 77,744 

Republican-cast 

ballots 
— 
in 
the 

key swing states of 

Michigan, Pennsylvania and 

Wisconsin. With the help of 

46 collective electoral votes 

in those states, the underdog 

Republican, a brash New York 

populist and self-styled “blue-

collar billionaire,” cruised to a 

comfortable 306-232 electoral 

college 
victory 
over 
his 

Democratic opponent Hillary 

Clinton, earning a four-year 

stay 
at 
1600 
Pennsylvania 

Ave. Since then, Democrats 

have been strategizing on how 

to remove Trump from office 

— specifically musing on a 

progressive revamp of the 

party.

Naturally, 
Democrats 

were shocked and dismayed 

by the results of Nov. 8, 

2016. Licking their electoral 

wounds, 
they 
immediately 

resolved to kill the Trump 

presidency in 2020. While 

Democratic determination to 

do so has solidified over the 

past two years, the party’s 

strategy to retake the White 

House 
remains 
uncertain. 

There is a profound fission 

in 
the 
party 
of 
Wilson, 

Roosevelt and Kennedy, an 

ongoing 
identity 
struggle 

between 
two 
competing 

factions. The first camp is 

the stable, if unenthused, old 

guard epitomized by the likes 

of 
Hillary 
Clinton, 
Chuck 

Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. 

The 
other 
is 
the 
surging 

progressive wing of Bernie 

Sanders, 
Elizabeth 
Warren 

and 
Alexandria 
Ocasio-

Cortez. While the latter camp 

urges an ouster of the tepid 

Democratic establishment and 

an embrace of progressivism 

to 
restore 
vitality 
to 
the 

Democratic 
Party, 
tapping 

a dynamic leftist candidate 

is not the surest route to 

a 
Democratic 
Oval 
Office 

in 2020. If the Democrats’ 

priority is to defeat Trump, 

an autopsy of 2016 indicates 

that a progressive 

transformation 
of 

the party must be 

deferred.

It’s 
a 

counterintuitive 

prescription. 
The 

Democrats 
played 

it safe in 2016 with 

Hillary Clinton — a 

candidate who was 

as 
establishment 

as 
establishment 

gets. 
Progressives 
reason 

that if it failed them then, 

it will fail them again. A 

left-wing firebrand, in the 

style of Sanders or Warren, 

would breathe life into an 

insipid party that needs to 

free itself from uninspiring 

old-guard 
vestiges. 
It 
is 

an 
attractive 
thought 
for 

Democratic 
leftists, 
but 

not a very strategic one. As 

disappointing as it may be for 

this contingent, the party must 

avoid progressive daydreams 

if they want to achieve the 

universal Democratic priority 

of removing Trump in 2020.

Last 
June, 
Alexandria 

Ocasio-Cortez — a Democratic 

Socialist from the Bronx and 

a current U.S. Representative 

for New York — captured the 

attention of the nation with 

her stunning Congressional 

primary victory over 10-term 

incumbent Joe Crowley. The 

then-28 year-old’s electoral 

upset was emblematic of a 

possible new trend in the 

Democratic Party of favoring 

impassioned 
progressivism 

over the establishment. In 

a recent spat with Ocasio-

Cortez, former Missouri Sen. 

Claire McCaskill expressed 

concern over the progressive 

surge. 
In 
a 
December 

interview 
with 
CNN, 

McCaskill 
questioned 
why 

Ocasio-Cortez is “the thing,” 

dismissively naming the new 

congresswoman “a bright and 

shiny new object” who “came 

out of nowhere.” The diction 

was undiplomatic, to be sure, 

but McCaskill’s implications 

hold. A so-called “bright and 

shiny” 
progressive 
dynamo 

will impair the Democrats’ 

chances in 2020.

Take a look at the 2016 

electoral map. If Clinton had 

won Ohio and Pennsylvania, 

she would be the president 

of the United States. Without 

Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral 

votes, 
winning 
Michigan, 

Ohio and Wisconsin would 

have put her over the critical 

270 
electoral 
vote 
mark. 

Swing 
states 
like 
Florida 

will, of course, be a bloody 

battleground between Trump 

and his Democratic opponent, 

but if 2016 is any indication, 

the next election could be 

won or lost in three or four 

states around the Great Lakes. 

Coastal 
progressivism, 
in 

the corporal form of Bernie 

Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, 

sells better in San Francisco 

than in Saginaw. Progressives 

must keep in mind that picking 

a presidential candidate is a 

strategic affair. You have to 

consider the greatest swing 

audience 
— 
in 
this 
case, 

middle 
and 
working-class 

voters in the upper Midwest 

— and wrap your package 

accordingly.

That’s why the Democrats 

need 
non-threatening, 

moderate 
familiarity 
in 

2020. They need a blue-jeans 

Democrat with folksy charm, 

a Joe Biden or Sherrod Brown, 

who can speak the language of 

the everyday Pennsylvanian 

or Ohioan and earn their vote 

back from Trump. To put 

the keys to the Oval Office 

back in blue hands, the fiery 

progressive wing must yield to 

pragmatism in the primaries, 

or risk extending their Trump 

nightmare into January 2025.

“No one’s easy to love,” Sharon 
Van Etten sings — but fans of Van 
Etten will have no trouble falling 
in love with her latest release. Her 
new album Remind Me Tomorrow 
is 10 tracks of the otherworldly 
and strange. One may find it 
initially disconcerting, with its 
repetitive, hypnotic sounds and 
Van Etten’s crooning. The album 
even presents itself as yet 
another somber, indie-pop 
pity-party, with soft vocals 
and an abundance of longing. 
The opening track “I Told 
You Everything” is quiet and 
lonely, the lines “Sitting at the 
bar / I told you everything” 
tinged with the subtle tone of 
regret. “Memorial Day,” too, 
feels at times almost alien. In 
fact, the entire first half of the 
album hangs on the cliff’s edge of 
bitter and sad.
The 
album, 
however, 
is 
anything but sad. It is truthful, 
it is vulnerable, it is powerful, it 
is a knock-your-socks-off dose of 
catharsis.
The album quickly grows in 
passion, power and energy from 
beginning to end. “Comeback 
Kid” comes roaring to life by the 
fourth track, all at once familiar, 

willful and wild. Van Etten’s 
story of a directionless runaway 
hits close to home — maybe too 
close. Van Etten sings, “Don’t 
let me slip away,” a plea of help 
that resonates in the darker 
spaces of the mind. But again, 
it’s not sad or painful, but rather 
relieving to hear someone else 
put to words a fear we often 
bury: a fear of losing our way. 
“Jupiter 4” and “Seventeen” also 
come bearing a dose of honesty 

— of acknowledgement — that is 
cathartic. Then, the penultimate 
closer, “Hands” is like a tsunami 
of emotion compared to the bare-
bones quiet of the opener, “I Told 
You Everything.”
It’s almost as if a movie-styled 
time-skip has occurred, where 
the main character grows up in 
a series of brief, interconnected 
scenes. The entire album feels like 
a bad case of deja-vu. The songs 

reach across a lifetime of follies, 
victories, and winding paths —
the well worn and the (as of yet) 
unexplored. It’s only by the end 
of the last track that one realizes 
the magic Van Etten has woven 
into her album: The stranger Van 
Etten sings of is actually you.
No, 
not 
everyone 
has 
experienced the same ups and 
the same downs that Van Etten 
describes, but the lingering sense 
of uncertainty throughout the 
album brushes close to home. 
Growing up is confusing and 
scary — full of crossroads, 
decisions and forked paths. 
The bare orchestration of the 
songs, combined with the soft 
vulnerability of Van Etten’s 
singing sometimes seems as if 
she could be that voice inside 
your head, the one that knows 
all your secrets, all your desires 
and all your regrets. Alarming 
though it may seem to have 
someone look right through all 
the walls and defenses, the end 
result is so very satisfying.
“What do I do?” “Where do 
I go?” “How do I do this?” Van 
Etten embraces this uncertainty. 
She completely, utterly owns it. 
And from this acceptance is a rare 
sense of freedom. It then seems 
so simple for listeners to do the 
same.

Van Etten matures with

Remind Me 
Tomorrow

Sharon Van Etten

Jagjaguwar

Some actors age gracefully. 
They forgo the youthful roles 
of their early careers, often in 
favor of those more mature and 
dramatic. Others simply ride 
their fame and influence to the 
director’s chair. These are the 
immortal ones, the Streeps, the 
McKellens, the De Niros. Some 
actors, however, find themselves 
unable to part with the roles 
and ideas that first made them 
great. They resist change with 
contempt until their careers 
are lost to obscurity. With 
his latest film “The Mule,” 
director 
and 
Western-film 
legend Clint Eastwood seems 
poised to do just that.
I went to see this film with 
my grandfather, both of us 
praying for “Dirty Harry” 
Clint Eastwood and not “The 
15:17 to Paris” Clint Eastwood. 
Unfortunately, what we got was 
“talking to an empty chair at the 
Republican National Convention” 
Clint Eastwood. For 
those not familiar, 
“The Mule” tells the 
story of Earl Stone 
(Clint 
Eastwood, 
“Gran 
Torino”), 
a 
charismatic 
horticulturalist 
in 
his early 90s who 
could 
never 
quite 

slow down to make time for his 
family. When Earl goes bankrupt, 
an opportunity arises for him to 
make some fast cash transporting 
contraband as a drug mule for the 
Mexican Drug Cartel. In short, 
the movie is baby boomer fantasy 
porn. No, seriously, a scene about 
two-thirds of the way through 
the movie sees Earl fawned over 
by topless prostitutes, and seems 
to exist with little purpose aside 
from being documented proof 
that Clint Eastwood can still get 
it up.

It’s rare that I should leave a 
movie without a single positive 
thing to say, and yet here we 
are. The writing is corny, the 
performances forgettable and the 
action sequences strangely absent 
from a movie advertising itself 
as an action film. Beyond being 
an abject failure of a film, “The 
Mule” also seems insistent on 
pushing Eastwood’s dated social 
politics. In one eye-roll inducing 
scene, Earl pulls over on the side 
of the road to help a young Black 
family with a flat tire. The father 

explains that he’s been on the 
internet trying to find a solution, 
to which Earl replies, “That’s the 
problem with you Millenials; can’t 
do anything without your dang 
Google boxes.” Earl then replaces 
the tire, but not without casually 
dropping a racial slur. When the 
family reprimands him, he rolls 
his eyes and is on his merry way 
to deliver the kilogram of cocaine 
in his trunk.
Obviously Earl Stone isn’t Clint 
Eastwood, but it’s impossible 
not to feel like the character is a 
surrogate for how Eastwood 
views himself: a charismatic 
bad boy full of wry witticisms 
and a condescending chagrin 
for political correctness. As a 
result, “The Mule” feels less 
like an actual film and more 
like a highlight reel of what 
happens when Eastwood has 
nobody around him willing to 
tell him “no.” It should serve as a 
testament to the weight that his 
name still carries that he managed 
to get Bradley Cooper (“A Star 
is Born”) to be in this movie, 
especially considering Cooper’s 
character, DEA agent Colin Bates, 
is completely forgettable. Then 
again, nothing about “The Mule” 
is particularly memorable. It feels 
like a caricature of a film we’ve all 
seen before. It’s a fitting metaphor 
as Clint Eastwood strays further 
and further into his own self-
characterization.

Eastwood is past prime

‘The Mule’

I’m writing this while watching snow 
fall on a frozen lake. There’s a guy zooming 
around on a four-wheeler with a sled 
attached the back, and his two tiny children 
are sitting on it looking like fluffy bundles 
of hats and scarves.
After long breaks, there’s always an 
undeniable thrill in coming back to Ann 
Arbor. You see all your friends, eat Frank’s 
hash browns and can spot maize and blue 
everywhere. As a second semester senior, 
I’ve spent a lot of time anticipating that 
moment when I take Exit 172 back into Ann 
Arbor or arrive at the Ann Arbor Amtrak 
Station.
Yet just as much as I love returning to 
Ann Arbor, I often find myself needing to 
escape once I’m there. Maybe it’s because 
Ann Arbor comes with the stress of school, 
or maybe it’s because Ann Arbor is a town 
of mediums: busy enough to be in constant 
motion but still quiet at odd hours, large 
enough to discover your own favorite coffee 
shop or bar but small enough to eventually 
see someone you know there.
Usually, a trip to Meijer or Trader Joe’s 
is enough to cure Ann Arbor’s intensity 
when I first come back to campus. Though 
they’re just a few miles from campus, these 
grocery store trips offer me a moment of 
repose and break the bubble of Ann Arbor 
that’s simultaneously exhilarating and 
exhausting.
This Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, 
I ventured out even further, heading up 
north to my roommate’s lake house. The 
back of their house faces Long Lake, and 
my friends and I have spent hours staring 
out the window watching people ice fish, 
take their children sledding or attempt to 
do donuts with their snowmobiles (would 

not recommend). Everything here is in 
stark contrast to Ann Arbor, from the lack 
of drunk people screaming at 2 a.m. to 
the amount of unplowed snow I can see 
extending into the distance.
I realize I’m waxing poetic to something 
Michiganders already know: Northern 
Michigan is beautiful.
But, seeing Northern Michigan has made 
me think about my relationship with Ann 
Arbor. It’s not that I don’t love the city, 
because I truly do. It’s filled with a sense 
of community for me, whether through 
writing or school or yoga. It’s where 
I’ve made so many wonderful friends, 
(somewhat) learned how to cook and grew 
up from the freshman I once was.
For many of us, Ann Arbor is a temporary 
home away from home, a place to live as we 
learn how to be young adults. Though the 
future is always uncertain, many of us know 
these years will be the only ones we spend 
in Ann Arbor or even the state of Michigan.
And maybe that’s why I feel the 
overwhelming urge to leave Ann Arbor on 
occasion. I know the time I have left in the 
place I began to call my home is running 
out, so I walk up and down State Street 
thinking about how in a few months I will 
graduate and leave Ann Arbor. I’ll no longer 
walk past South Quad and get nostalgic or 
stroll into Frank’s for breakfast or run into 
three of my friends in Angell Hall on the 
way to class; being in Ann Arbor reminds 
me of that.
As bleak as that may sound, I’m still 
missing Ann Arbor right now, even while 
sitting in front of a massive window 
watching children sled on a frozen lake. 
Because I love Ann Arbor for being intense 
and thrilling and the perfect medium 
between a college town and a real city.
Also, how can you not love Frank’s hash 
browns?

I think I was in third grade 
when my mom received a call 
from the mother of one of my 
friends. This particular mom 
sounded 
nervous. 
“Do 
you 
think there’s any chance Joey 
might have, um, introduced 
Nick to ‘YouTube?’” 
Well, that was certainly 
possible, my mom replied. Joey 
laughed a lot at those online 
videos, after all, and had even 
showed his sister some of his 
favorites. No issues there.
There 
were 
issues. 
Nick 
came from a Mormon family. 
Forget about even uttering 
a curse word; these folks 
(among the kindest and most 
compassionate I’ve ever met) 
were intensely devoted to their 
religion, which meant they 
were altogether prohibitive of 
anything that might corrupt 
their children.
Well, maybe it worked. Nick 
definitely didn’t turn out as 
poorly as the rest of us. In 2019, 
however, I think I’ve begun to 
scratch the surface about why 
my entire generation ended 
up in our collective medley 
of 
fuckedupness: 
YouTube. 
Could it be? You’re probably 
wondering how you got here, 
too, so do join me on this 
journey 
of 
spirituality. 
In 
order to figure out what you’ve 
become, you need to rediscover 
your origins. Here’s what your 
first YouTube video says about 
you. 

Evolution of Dance

On the surface, you form 
your strongest relationships 
didactically, 
dominating 
hangouts with news of the 
latest Twitter beef (and having 
fun hyping it all up). But look 
deeper. There are layers to 
you. Under your Twists and 
technical perfection of the 

Thriller 
dance 
exists 
your 
sensitive 
being, 
one 
who 
dances not for some soul-
fulfilling form of expression 
but for instant gratification 
from others. You understand 
that, while you’re only as good 
as your best Milly rock, your 
true worth is founded in who 
you share those Milly rocks 
with. So Milly rock all you 
want; just make sure there’s an 
audience.

Numa Numa

You’re incredibly ready for 
the real world. In fact, you are 
the real world. So much of life, 
it turns out, depends on your 
mastery of the clout chase, and 
Numa Numa makes up the very 
foundation of Clout. It’s true: 
just exercising your ability to 
bring this dance staple to life 
equals relevance in university 
and professional circles. At 
the very least, being able to 
keep these moves in the back 
pocket 
most 
definitely 
led 
to a total domination of Bar/
Bat Mitzvah or school dance 
circuits, and that charisma 
counts for something.

Nyan Cat 10 hours (original)

You’re a sadistic dirtbag. No 
one forgot about all the bad 
jokes you made just as everyone 
was about to fall asleep at 
sleepovers in 2009, no, we most 
certainly don’t care about your 
Fushigi, and yes, of course 
we’ve seen your super dope 
mix-every-fountain-drink-
in-one-cup move. Find a new 
slant, Mendeleev.

Boom Goes the Dynamite

Testosterone. Testosterone? 
Testosterone. 
That’s

Testosterone! Testy Testy. Test,

Liam Kyle Sullivan

I think I heard cuts from 
“Shoes” at more than one club 
in Berlin during my four-
month stay there, which, if it 
doesn’t say enough in itself, 
should signify how freaky this 
stuff really is. First, I guess, I 
commend you for your bravery. 
More importantly, I laud you for 
your elevated consciousness. 
If something like “Muffins” 
launched you into the world 
of online entertainment, that 
means you probably learned 
what postmodernism was in, 
like, sixth grade. Big stuff.

Daft Hands – Harder, Better, 
Faster, Stronger

My first thought upon first 
seeing this video: who could 
possibly have had the gall to 
steal a Kanye West sample? 
My second thought: I’m a 
dummy. My third thought: oh 
shit, mom made pizza rolls 
again. 
Everyone 
else 
who 
was introduced to YouTube 
through this video: hold my 
fanny pack, time to Festival 
Shuffle for no one in particular.

DAILY HEALTH & WELLNESS COLUMN

There are shows we turn to for 
unswerving excellence, there are 
shows we love because they never 
make any discernible attempts 
at quality and somewhere in the 
murky middle, there is NBC’s 
“This Is Us,” which shuffles across 
the spectrum like a chameleon on 
roller skates. “Oh, you thought we 
were good?” the show sneers at its 
audience each Tuesday night. “No, 
how silly of you, we’re actually 
quite bad.”
But then, at the precise moment 
you make your peace with the 
show as a weepy melodramatic 
trainwreck with no hope in 
sight, the ghost of “This Is Us” 
will re-emerge and cry in faux 
disbelief, “What are you talking 
about? We’re inventive and layered 
and structurally brilliant with 
knockout performances!” I think 
this is what people these days call 
‘gaslighting.’
This 
surely 
is 
the 
most 
frustrating fandom, the uniquely 
painful kind that shaves years 
off one’s life. It requires both a 
boatload of faith and an equal 
amount 
of 
distrust. 
It’s 
the 
equivalent of that year Sandra 
Bullock won the Razzie for 
Worst Actress and the Oscar for 
Best Actress in the span of one 
weekend. It’s like watching Russell 
Westbrook chuck brick after brick 
every night and finally tucking 
your Thunder jersey away in the 
attic only to head back downstairs 
in time to see him drain the clutch 
game-winner. How can something 
so good be so bad? How can 

something so bad be so good?
The drama’s third season has 
served up some lovely, pitch-
perfect episodes and some blah 
misses. After a midseason hiatus, 
“This Is Us” made its return last 
week in the most “This Is Us” way 
possible: The mediocre acting 
was 
frequently 
groan-worthy, 
occasionally moving, and all in all, 
perfectly average.
A year ago, it seemed impossible 
that the weakest storyline on 
“This Is Us” could be Randall’s 
(Sterling K. Brown, “American 

Crime Story”). He and Susan 
Kelechi Watson’s Beth (“Louie”) 
have frequently saved the show 
from descending into Sad Sack 
City, anchoring it with charisma 
and chemistry and a rare, totally 
functional onscreen partnership. 
But Randall’s campaign for a city 
council seat in Philadelphia, which 
once seemed like the show’s way of 
teaching him a tough lesson about 
his excessive righteousness, has 
now swallowed him whole while 
indulging the character’s worst 
tendencies.
Fortunately for him, Randall 
lives in a bizarro universe where the 
electorate is won over by spirited 
oratory. (Aaron Sorkin called. He 
wants his naïve worldview back. 

Also, he made some Gilbert and 
Sullivan reference I didn’t quite 
understand.) Never mind that 
Randall is a Philly resident by 
technicality, and actually lives in 
Alpine, NJ., which is about as far 
away from Philadelphia as you can 
get while still being in NJ.
It’s equally surprising that 
Kevin Pearson (Justin Hartley, 
“Revenge”) has emerged as the 
third season’s strongest character, 
deciding to learn more about his 
father’s experiences in Vietnam 
while pursuing a relationship 
with the sometimes closed-off, 
“complicated” 
documentarian, 
Zoe 
(Melanie 
Liburd, 
“Dark 
Matter”). His portion of “The 
Last Seven Weeks” works nicely 
as a link between both of these 
processes, 
culminating 
in 
an 
earned, 
moving 
moment 
of 
character-growth. Kate (Chrissy 
Metz, “American Horror Story”), 
finally pregnant this season after 
struggling to conceive, is sidelined 
with a C-plot this episode, a zany 
quest to retrieve her husband’s 
Star Wars action figures after 
accidentally donating them, but 
Metz makes the most of it.
So where does “This Is Us” go 
from here? Who knows. There 
are still several loose ends to tie 
up, a flash-forward mystery yet 
to be resolved and, from Kevin’s 
Vietnam 
digging, 
a 
potential 
long-lost family member waiting 
in the wings for his story to be 
told. All that’s certain is that the 
remaining episodes of this season 
will be a little excellent and also 
a bit terrible. So let’s buckle in: 
After all, this is a show that killed 
a character via Crock Pot, and did 
so beautifully.

‘This is Us’ is uneven and 
convoluted, as it usually is

TV REVIEW

In the week leading up 
to 
my 
seeing 
“The 
Great 
Tamer,” conceived, visualized 
and 
directed 
by 
Dimitris 
Papaioannou, the only thing I 
knew was that it contained full 
frontal nudity. So, naturally, 
I asked my dad to accompany 
me 
for 
a 
unique 
father-
daughter bonding experience. 
Unfortunately, he was unable 
(or unwilling) to join me on 
what promised to be “a visually 
stunning production of ten 
dancers that grapples with the 
meaning of life and the mystery 
of death.” So on Friday night, I 
shuffled into my seat, dad-less 
and defenseless, not even close 
to ready for the self-proclaimed 
“surrealist nightmare” and the 
experience of a lifetime.
When I took my seat, there 
was already an actor on stage. 
I checked my phone. I wasn’t 
late, still five minutes to show 
time, but he was just hanging 
out 
center 
stage, 
looking 
around at the audience. Then, 
the play began. The house lights 
remained on while the man on 
stage slowly began undressing 
himself. There was no music, 
no sound, just the occasional 
uncomfortable cough from the 
audience. Once he was fully 
undressed, he laid down on a 
white sheet of what I assumed 
to be plywood. Another man 
appeared to cover him in a 

sheet. As soon as that man left 
another man uncovered the 
naked man. While I was still 
trying to wrap my head around 
how 
he 
was 
comfortable 
enough to be fully nude in front 
of an audience of 500 people, 
there were murmured chuckles 
from the audience as the cycle 
started over. And over. And 
over. By the 13th or 14th time, 
the chuckles subsided in place 
of a fatigued anticipation for a 
new bout of action.
And action it was. Soon 
enough, the stage was alive with 
movement. If I diverted my gaze 
to one person, two more people 
would appear onstage, usually 
naked, always in the midst of a 
new interpretive scene. These 
scenes built upon one another, 
fluidly moving from one to 
the next and often recurring 
throughout the show. Even the 
covering tarp came back once 
or twice. With so much going 
on, not every scene’s meaning 
was apparent. In fact, very 
few scene’s meanings were 
apparent. I genuinely wish I 
could say what the play was 
concretely about, but to be 
honest, I’m not exactly sure 
myself.
Even calling it a play is a 
stretch; there were no words 
and only limited music. The 
performance featured twelve 
dancers who spent the hour and 
forty-five minutes contorting 
their 
bodies 
into 
visually 
stunning 
and 
unimaginable 
shapes, depicting puzzling yet 

fascinating — sometimes even 
grotesque — interpretations of 
human existence. Each dancer 
was 
barely 
distinguishable 
from 
one 
another, 
always 
dressed in black and thrown 
together in various formations, 
often being used as singular 
body parts making up one 
whole human. While many 
parts of this performance were 
confusing 
and 
disturbing, 
some parts were relatable and 
beautiful.
There 
was 
a 
man 
who 
entered in a full body ceramic 
cast. He could barely move, 
needing a crutch just to walk. 
When the other man onstage 
realized his problem, he began 
breaking the ceramic shell 
off his body by hugging him. 
Though they had just met, the 
man in the cast had to learn to 
trust his new friend quickly, at 
least enough for him to put his 
hands around his neck. With 
this deep sense of trust, the 
ceramic man allowed his friend 
to break through his tough 
outer shell to see the person 
he was beneath. With one final 
heart 
and 
ceramic-breaking 
hug, the man was free from his 
binding cast. He patted himself 
down, in awe of his new body, 
shook hands with his friend 
and left. The friend was left 
with nothing but a handshake 
and a pile of broken, ceramic 
hopes.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

As 
Mel 
Pearson 
sat 
down in the 
offices at Yost 
Ice 
Arena 
on 
Monday, 
he 
admitted 
he 
was 
disappointed 
with 
his 
Michigan 
hockey team.
Pearson 
had just walked in from the 
Wolverines’ practice, and coming 
off a bye week, Pearson’s team 
didn’t have a great Monday 
practice.
It was clearly weighing on 
Pearson’s mind. At one point, 
he went off on a bit of a tangent, 
seeming to speculate about why 
his players were a bit lackluster.
“I’ll be fine when I leave here. 
I’m fine. I’m not gonna let them 
ruin my day,” Pearson finished, 
perhaps 
trying 
to 
convince 
himself as much as anyone else.
Any of Pearson’s frustrations 
make sense in the midst of this 
season, though. The Wolverines 
began the year ranked fourth 
in the nation. But they haven’t 
strung together wins like many 
expected them to — currently 
sitting at 8-9-6 — and time is 
running out for Michigan to 
climb the rankings and keep 
postseason hopes alive.
“We talked, and we’re in 
playoff mode,” Pearson said. “Just 
like, you know, this is playoff 
hockey. You’ve got to play every 
game like it’s your last game. And 
I know it’s a cliché, but you really 
have to. I mean, you really have to 
show up and play hard.”
Luckily for the Wolverines, 
they were in nearly an identical 
position last season.
Last 
January, 
Michigan 
needed to pile up some signature 
wins. It responded with a sweep 
of Minnesota which catapulted 
the Wolverines to wins in 11 of 
their last 14 games, allowing for 
a postseason run to the Frozen 
Four.
The 
similarities 
are 
even 

deeper than that.
Last season, Michigan lost a 
top producer when forward Will 
Lockwood suffered a season-
ending shoulder injury at the 
World Junior Championships. 
This year, sophomore forward 
Josh Norris went down at the 
same 
tournament, 
leaving 
the 
Wolverines 
comparably 
hamstrung.
Lockwood says he has given 
Norris some advice here and 
there and will continue to do so 
as Norris needs it.
The bigger point, though, is 
that Lockwood’s injury seemed 
to be a bit of a rallying point for 
Michigan last season. If that’s 
the case, he can help advance the 
hunger to mimic the results of 
yesteryear.
After all, Lockwood, one of 

the few players on the roster 
who didn’t get to experience 
last season’s magic, will be 
looked upon to help orchestrate 
another run. And perhaps he 
is already trying to help with 
that, as Pearson complimented 
Lockwood’s 
practice 
Monday 
despite his overall feeling about 
the team’s day.
“(Lockwood) comments about 
that,” Pearson said. “He enjoyed 
it, but he felt like he wasn’t a part 
of it almost. So no question about 
it, yeah. And he’s been good. He’s 
been really good. And he worked 
hard today.
“... And he wants a little taste 
of that, which is good, because 
he didn’t get it his first year. You 
know, we weren’t very good that 
year. We went 13-19. Last year we 
took a step, but he doesn’t get to 

participate, so you want that.”
Added Lockwood: “It’s weird. 
You get it taken away from you, 
and you don’t really know what 
you have until you’ve lost it.”
Lockwood was 
talking 
about 
his 
injury, 
but 
the same can be 
said for a season. 
At 
some 
point, 
obviously, 
it 
will end. There 
will 
only 
be 
one 
national 
champion, 
and 
the rest of the 
teams will be left 
wondering what more they could 
have done to reach the top.
Now is a point that the 
Wolverines may look back to in a 
few months, for better or worse.

No. 15 Penn State comes to 
Ann Arbor on Thursday before 
the Wolverines go to New York 
City to face the Nittany Lions on 
Saturday. It’s a prime opportunity 
to start climbing 
the 
Pairwise 
rankings.
If last season 
taught 
us 
anything 
about 
the Wolverines, 
it is that they 
have a penchant 
for playing well 
with their backs 
against the wall. 
When they had 
no option other than to win, they 
did just that, over and over again. 
It isn’t a healthy way to live in 
college hockey, a sport in which 
upsets are common a night-to-

night basis, but it worked once.
And it is the reality Michigan 
faces now.
 “You know, I think we need to 
have that spark,” Lockwood said. 
“And we know it’s not just gonna 
happen. And we can’t say, you 
know, ‘We did it last year. It’s just 
automatically gonna happen.’ It 
starts from hard work and hard 
work in practice. And, you know, 
I think once we get a bit of a spark 
like that and win a couple games 
in a row, I think we have a chance 
to make a run, and I look forward 
to it.”
Pearson shares that sense of 
urgency.
When asked when Michigan 
must get going before it’s too late, 
Pearson made sure to leave no 
room for interpretation.
“Now.”

SportsTuesday Column: A familiar inflection point

MIKE 
PERSAK

After up-and-down freshman year, 
Dakota Raabe maturing off the ice

Dakota Raabe walked into the 
Michigan hockey locker room last 
January to find his locker empty.
Then a freshman, Raabe had 
been dealing with some academic 
issues and the Wolverines decided 
to send a message to him.
“You have a responsibility 
here as a student-athlete,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson on 
Monday. “Our program, I can 
only speak for our program, but 
you go to class, you’re on time. 
You represent your family, your 
teammates, the program, the 
athletic department. There’s a 
responsibility there, and if you’re 
not doing it, you’re not entitled to 
play hockey. It’s a benefit.”
A year later, Raabe is one of the 
players Pearson frequently calls 
out — praising his growth and 
increased maturity over his time 
so far at Michigan. The sophomore 
now plays on a line that Pearson 
says he’d match up against any 
team’s top line.
But it wasn’t always that way.
Last season, while trying to 
find his way as a freshman, Raabe 
struggled to understand his role 
and do the little things he needed 
to do to be successful. 
“With him, it’s just, I think 
(telling 
him) 
that 
you 
are 
important to the team,” Pearson 
said. “Regardless of your role, how 
minimal or whatever it is might 
seem. Maybe that was part of him, 
doesn’t think he’s that important, 
‘Because I’m not Josh Norris, I’m 

not Quinn Hughes, I’m not Cooper 
Marody.’
“You can get a tendency to 
think, ‘Well, they’re going to do it. 
I just have to show up and I’ll be 
fine.’ But that’s not the case.”
This year, Raabe has been a 
nearly constant presence in the 
lineup — he’s missed only one 
game all season. Along with 
that 
consistent 
playing 
time 
comes a deeper 
understanding of 
his role and the 
importance of his 
contributions 
to 
the team.
“He’s 
worked 
a lot harder, but 
that’s 
part 
of 
understanding 
how you have to do 
it each and every 
day,” 
Pearson 
said. “You just can’t do it once in 
a while, you just can’t be satisfied 
with being in the lineup. You have 
to do what you’re good at and try 
and bring it every day.”
As Raabe has grown on the ice, 
his role as a leader has developed 
off it. On a team with 10 freshmen, 
any player that wants to add 
leadership is welcomed.
And Raabe is largely trying to 
show the freshmen exactly what 
Pearson wanted him to learn last 
year.
“I’m just trying to show that 
each day, you have to bring 
it,” Raabe said. “Just from the 
situation I was in, it doesn’t matter 
what your role is or whatever as 
long as you just accept it, work 

hard at it, and then, when you’re 
given an opportunity, you take the 
chance.”
Raabe 
and 
his 
linemates, 
freshmen forwards Garrett Van 
Wyhe and Nolan Moyle, have 
played together in almost every 
game this year. As a sophomore 
playing 
with 
two 
freshmen, 
Raabe’s leadership is even more 
important with his linemates.
But it seems he is not the only 
leader on that line. 
“He’s playing with a guy like 
(Van Wyhe) that’s really helping 
him,” Pearson said. “Garrett’s 
a pretty mature kid for being a 
freshman. … They complement 
each other well, how they play. 
And Garrett’s a hard worker. 
That’s his M.O., work hard, so I 
think sometimes that rubs off or 
should rub off on your linemates 
and your teammates. I think it 
has.”
The hard work and commitment 
that Van Wyhe has helped instill 
in Raabe shows itself when 
the 
two 
play 
together on the 
penalty kill for 
the Wolverines.
Perhaps 
no 
example of this 
is more striking 
than 
when 
Raabe and Van 
Wyhe — along 
with 
junior 
defenseman 
Luke Martin — 
killed off two minutes of a five-
on-three advantage for Ohio State 
two weekends ago.
Those two minutes showed 
Raabe’s ability and willingness 
to sacrifice his body to block a 
shot and make a play. And that 
willingness, especially in contrast 
to his freshman season, is exactly 
what Pearson wants to see from 
him.
“That 
second 
year, 
you’ve 
matured, you understand what it 
takes,” Pearson said. “And you’re 
just willing to do it. I think that’s it.
“He can skate, he can score, so 
he’s just got to believe in himself. 
But he’s been much better. We 
need him to be good going down 
the stretch. He’s taken big steps.”

Michigan suffers loss in exhibition

Kate Fahey slammed her 
racquet against the court in 
frustration after watching yet 
another forehand sail long.
It was that kind of a start for 
the No. 10 Michigan women’s 
tennis team, which saw its Big 
Ten Tournament title defense 
begin on the wrong side of a 
lopsided upset. Ohio State took 
the Michigan Invitational by 
storm on Saturday, sweeping 
the hosts in an exhibition four-
match doubles series.
When the dust settled, the 
Wolverines dodged a bullet. 
Because of the event’s exhibition 
status, results don’t factor into 
team and individual records — 
thus saving No. 10 Michigan 
from the stain of a 4-0 doubles 
loss 
against 
an 
unranked 
opponent.
The Buckeyes underscored 
their 
dominant 
performance 
by toppling the Wolverines’ 
15th-ranked tandem of Fahey 
and fellow senior Brienne Minor, 
the NCAA’s 2017 singles national 
championship, in the top doubles 
match. 
As 
unforced 
errors 
mounted, the duo lacked energy 
in a 6-1 loss against Ohio State’s 
47th-ranked pairing of Shiori 
Fukuda and Isabelle Boulais.
But if there’s anyone who 
can diagnose and cure the 
problem before its destructive 
onset, 
it’s 
Michigan 
coach 
Ronni Bernstein. Now in her 
12th season at the helm of the 
program, the five-time Big Ten 
Coach of the Year has guided 
the Wolverines to seven Big Ten 
championships since 2010.
“(Doubles play) is something 
we’re working on,” Bernstein 
said. “It’s not just the result — 
it’s that our energy wasn’t there. 
They need to feel us, and I didn’t 
feel us in the building today.”
With the sour taste of the 
doubles sweep still lingering, 
Michigan took the court again 
— this time for an eight-match 
singles series against Tennessee. 
Highlighted 
by 
a 
Fahey 
comeback win, the Wolverines 
earned four victories against 
the Volunteers to cap off the 

afternoon. Fahey — a three-
time All-Big Ten selection who 
entered the season tabbed as 
the nation’s No. 3 singles player 
— found herself in a quick 3-0 
hole against Tennessee’s Sadie 
Hammond. With the set on the 
brink of slipping away, more 
glimmers of frustration began to 
shine through.
“My energy was a little 
negative,” Fahey said. “I was 
trying to yell and be expressive 
but it wasn’t in a positive way. 
I’m a super competitive person 
— I express my emotions a lot, 
and everyone knows that. I shut 
down when I stay within myself, 
so I like to yell.”
Following the rocky start, 
Fahey found her footing during 
the match’s second changeover. 
She rallied to force a tiebreaker, 
but Hammond answered with 
a decisive 7-3 win to take the 
opening frame.
Instead of unraveling after 
seeing her comeback bid fall 
short, Fahey hit the reset button. 
The New Jersey native’s ability 
to manage her fierce competitive 
drive has earmarked her storied 
career, and she comfortably 
captured 6-1 victories in the 
ensuing two sets to win the 
match.
Fahey 
wasn’t 
the 
only 
Wolverine who put on a strong 
singles showing — Minor, junior 
Chiara 
Lommer 
and 
junior 
Giulia Pairone also secured 
victories against the Volunteers.
Lommer and Minor both won 
in straight sets — 6-1, 6-1 and 
6-3, 7-5, respectively — while 
Pairone was put to the test in 

her Michigan debut. The junior 
transfer from Arkansas won the 
opening set, 6-4, before losing a 
tight tiebreaker in the following 
frame. Going into the third set of 
her singles match after already 
playing doubles, Pairone knew 
she was in a battle against both 
fatigue and Tennessee’s Gabby 
Schuck.
That didn’t stop Pairone — she 
came out firing on all cylinders, 
igniting an emotional spark that 
propelled her to a 6-1 win.
“(Pairone) was on a high 
level,” Bernstein said. “When 
you watch her, the biggest thing 
is that her energy is great. We’re 
really happy to have her.”
Though 
Saturday’s 
results 
weren’t 
encouraging, 
the 
Wolverines’ confidence didn’t 
waver 
in 
the 
slightest. 
If 
anything, the positive takeaways 
outweighed the shortcomings by 
showing a glimpse of this unit’s 
potential.
“We almost got to the Final 
Four my freshman year, and 
I really think we can do even 
better (this year),” Fahey said. 
“On a national level, we can 
do really big things with this 
group.”
When 
Fahey 
slammed 
her racquet on the court in 
frustration, 
it 
came 
away 
unscathed. Not even a scuff. 
Rather 
than 
breaking, 
the 
racquet lifted her to a roaring 
comeback over Hammond just 
moments later.
After a lackluster first day, 
Bernstein can only hope her 
team has the resilience of her 
star senior’s racquet.

Punch to the Bucks!

Michigan stages fourth-quarter comeback, beats Ohio State 62-58 to keep NCAA Tournament dreams afloat

With 13 seconds remaining 
in 
Sunday’s 
matchup 
with 
Ohio State, Michigan women’s 
basketball 
freshman 
forward 
Naz Hillmon delivered a game-
winning layup, completing a 
12-point fourth quarter comeback 
in a 62- 58 victory. 
In their only regular season 
contest against one another this 
season 
the 
Wolverines 
(12-7 
overall, 3-4 Big Ten) defeated 
the Buckeyes (7-9 overall, 3-4 
Big Ten) in what was a thrilling, 
scrappy game thanks in large 
part to Hillmon and senior guard 
Nicole Munger. 
After scoring 19 first quarter 
points, the Wolverines seemingly 
fell asleep for the next two 
quarters, only scoring a combined 
18 points. Then the fourth quarter 
came, and everything changed. 
“We were talking about, in the 
third quarter, how we couldn’t 
have been playing any more 
(tightly),” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “We were 
really low energy at that point, 
with the exception of Nicole. We 
said, ‘We have to get some stops 
if we’re going to win this game.’ 
… So we started to score and I 
think when we started to score 
we gained some confidence back. 
“They were scoring with us 
at the beginning of the fourth 
quarter, but then they got tight. 
And I think us scoring, our fans 
behind us, the crowd getting 
rowdy, we were able to get stops. 
And not only were we able to get 
stops, but we came up with the 
rebounds. And I think our kids 
were really selling out, doing 
everything they could to come 
up with those rebounds down the 
stretch.”
Michigan entered the quarter 
down nine, but quickly battled 
back to cut the lead to six with 
6:15 remaining in the game. It 
then rattled off three straight 
layups to tie the game before an 

Ohio State three with 1:36 left on 
the clock. 
On the ensuing possession, 
Munger calmly knocked down 
a three to yet again tie the game 
and send Crisler into a frenzy. 
The Buckeyes failed to convert 
on their next possession as senior 
center Hallie Thome blocked an 
attempted floater with 41 seconds 
on the clock. For their final 
possession, the Wolverines found 
Hillmon on the right block to give 
Michigan the lead for good. 
“That’s just our team fighting 
back,” Munger said. “Being at 
home helps so much. The crowd 
was incredible. It was nice. The 
crowd made it happen. The team 
played really well and went out 
and grinded. It’s just a lot of fun. 
We did it together. That was 
what was most important. They 
couldn’t stop Naz inside, so we 
kept going to her. Hallie had such 
a day. Her block at the end there 
isn’t something a lot of people 
are going to remember but it was 
game-changing. I think everyone 
played such an important part in 
this win and that’s what makes 
it so incredible. So kudos to 
everyone down the line. 1-14. 
Proud of us.”
Hillmon, who came off the 
bench only 1:45 into the game 
after 
Wolverines 
sophomore 
forward Hailey Brown got into 
early foul trouble, left her mark 
scoring eight first quarter points 
while shooting a perfect 4-for-4 
from the floor.
In 
the 
second 
quarter, 
Michigan struggled to find the 
basket. Hillmon scored twice 
in the first three minutes of 
the quarter but, after that, the 
Wolverines didn’t score again 
until Thome converted a hook 
shot in the low post with 2:45 
remaining in the period. And 
while junior guard Akienreh 
Johnson followed Thome’s shot 
with a 3- pointer just a minute 
later, 
outside 
of 
those 
four 
buckets, the Michigan offense 
could get nothing else going.

On top of the lack of scoring, 
the Wolverines committed 11 
first half turnovers and nine team 
fouls, seven of which coming in 
the first quarter. 
However, 
Michigan 
still 
clung to a one-point half time 
lead, 28-27, thanks to a strong 
defensive showing in the second 
quarter, holding Ohio State to 
5-for-14 from the field. 
Then the third quarter came.
In front of what had been a 
raucous crowd in the first half, the 
Wolverines came out flat in the 
third quarter, not scoring until a 
pair of Hillmon free throws with 
4:15 remaining and not making a 
field goal until the final minute. 
While 
Michigan 
shot 
a 
mere 2-11 from the field, the 
Buckeyes, meanwhile, went 6-10 
and dominated the Wolverines, 
forcing 
five 
turnovers 
and 
outrebounding Michigan nine to 
seven.
“I think we had too many 
turnovers, we were trying to 
force the ball,” Barnes Arico said 
of the team’s struggles. “Now 
here’s the opposite side of ok 
(we’ve) got all these great post 

players and we’re trying to get 
them touches, but everyone in the 
country knows that we’re trying 
to get them touches. So they’re 
packing the paint. Extremely 
packing the paint. And we’re still 
throwing the ball there. And we 
were forcing it instead of getting 
ball movement, instead of getting 
better touches. 
“So that’s why I think we 
struggled with our turnovers, 
really weren’t getting good shots 
and struggled without movement 
of the basketball. And that’s 
kind of a work in progress. It’s 
something that we know we have 
to get better at but we’re gonna 
keep working on it.”
But, after Munger knocked 
down her third 3-pointer with 
18 seconds to cut the lead to nine, 
the Wolverines suddenly had life 
heading into the final quarter. 
Munger scored nine of her 
18 points in the fourth quarter, 
including a clutch three point 
to tie the game immediately 
following an Ohio State three 
with just over a minute remaining 
in the game. 
The rest is history. 

Naz Hillmon may have led 
the Wolverines in scoring. 
Hailey Brown made two critical 
layups to keep Michigan within 
touching distance in the fourth 
quarter. And point guard Amy 
Dilk demonstrated poise at 
the helm by knocking down 
two clutch free throws late 
and providing her teammates 
with open looks on multiple 
occasions.
There 
were 
multiple 
performances from Michigan 
players that contributed to a 
come-from-behind win over 
bitter rival Ohio State on 
Sunday afternoon — many of 
them by underclassmen — and 
yet, the two biggest plays of the 
game came from the two senior 
Wolverines — guard Nicole 
Munger 
and 
center 
Hallie 
Thome. For a team largely 
characterized by its youthful 
exuberance and inexperience, 
the veterans stepped up in a 
massive way.
When Ohio State took a 
three-point lead with a minute 
left, Munger responded by 
drilling a three of her own.
“Being a senior she’s got 
to know ‘You’re getting you 
the ball.’ She is a tremendous 
shooter,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “The way 
she shoots the basketball in 
practice 
is 
incredible. 
She 
doesn’t miss. Now the same 
shots she’s not always getting 
in the game … but she’s just 
stayed the course and kept 
working on it.”
Seconds 
later, 
Thome 
blocked Makayla Waterman’s 
floater on the other end and 
snatched the rebound. From 
there, Michigan never looked 
back.
At 
times 
this 
season, 
both 
Munger 
and 
Thome 
have struggled to give the 
Wolverines 
the 
consistent 

on-court output they’re capable 
of, but their commitment to the 
team and the guidance they’ve 
provided for their younger 
teammates has never wavered. 
This game was just another 
example of that.
“It’s like having a coach on 
the floor,” Hillmon said. “Coach 
talks about how important the 
experience of Hal and Munger 
is and you can definitely see 
that. Just in our huddles, 
they’re the main ones talking.
“Nicole’s throwing her body 
everywhere. She’s sacrificing 
for the team. If there’s one 
person that’s for the team, the 
team, the team, it’s Munger. She 
goes out there every day and if 
her shot’s not falling, she’ll play 
good defense. Anything she can 
do to pump us up.”
Against 
the 
Buckeyes, 
Munger 
was 
dangerous 
offensively — pouring in 18 
points. Thome’s scoreline may 
not have been as impressive 
with just six points, but her 
presence 
was 
undeniable. 
Whether she and Thome filled 
up the stat sheet or not, they 
had a tremendous impact on 
the outcome of this game.
Though the Wolverines still 
sit tenth in the Big Ten, this 
game was as close to a must-win 
as any they’ve had this season 
and still keeps their NCAA 
Tournament hopes alive. In 
the fourth quarter, there was 
a discernible sense of urgency 
on display from the team in 
white, and Munger and Thome 
— with their days at Michigan 
numbered — were the catalysts.
“Hungry dogs run faster and 
we’re hungry,” Munger said. 
“We need wins. Every game 
in the Big Ten is gonna be like 
this. It’s gonna be a grinder. 
We try to stay hungry and keep 
attacking each day, try to get a 
little bit better.
If we do that, at the end of 
the season we’ll be a lot better 
than where we started.”

Senior guard Nicole Munger helped lift the Wolverines to a comeback win.

‘M’ looking to move on

Maddie Mariani stood tall, 
took a breath and composed 
herself. Then the freshman 
sped down the runway and 
gracefully launched herself over 
the vault. She landed cleanly on 
the mat, where she was mobbed 
by her coaches and teammates.
The scoreboard flashed a 
solid 9.825.
For 
Mariani 
and 
her 
teammates, it was a moment 
of exhalation, energy and, for 
the first time in over a week, 
normalcy.
Eight days after Michigan 
initially hired former senior 
vice 
president 
of 
USA 
Gymnastics, Rhonda Faehn, to 
be an assistant coach — and four 
days after she was fired — the 
Wolverines returned to the mat. 
They did so with an eye toward 
moving on from a tumultuous 
week.
“It was kind of an emotional 
weekend — a high and a low,” 
said senior Emma McLean. “We 
pulled it back together, and it’s 
not anything we can’t handle. 
I think our foundation is so 
strong that at this point nothing 
is going to shake us.”
Faehn 
departed 
USA 
Gymnastics in the fallout of the 
Larry Nassar scandal. She was 
hired by Michigan on Thursday, 
Jan. 10. She was fired four days 
later.
Sunday 
evening, 
in 
the 
statement announcing Faehn’s 
firing, athletic director Warde 
Manuel 
characterized 
her 
hiring as the “wrong decision.”
The decision to part ways 
with Faehn was met with 
displeasure 
from 
many 
on 
the team. Senior Olivia Karas 
was among those who reacted 
negatively at the time, tweeting 
Sunday, “Disappointed that this 
opportunity has been taken 
from us. No one seems to care 
that we were so excited to have 
Rhonda joining us this season. 
Very very disappointed.”
Friday, though holding to a 
similar sentiment, Karas struck 
a softer tone.

“(The coaches) were very 
transparent with us, and we 
were really excited to have her 
here,” Karas said. “I’m really 
upset about losing her on our 
coaching 
staff. 
However 
I 
understand the backlash and 
understand how there could be 
feelings towards it that could 
make it not necessarily a good 
idea. But I am very sad. I really 
liked her.”
Michigan coach Bev Plocki, 
meanwhile, kept her focus on 
the meet, one in which the 
Wolverines topped Michigan 
State, 195.975-194.050.
“Yeah, I’ve talked about that,” 
Plocki said Friday, when asked 
about her decision to make the 
hiring. “Right now we’re going 
to continue focusing on moving 
forward.”
In Saturday’s announcement 
of Faehn’s hiring — issued a day 
after The Daily learned of it — 
Plocki offered effusive praise.
“I 
have 
known 
and 
respected 
Rhonda 
Faehn 
for over two decades,” she 
said in the statement. “Her 
accomplishments in our sport 
speak 
for 
themselves. 
Her 
technical 
knowledge 
and 
experience will greatly benefit 
our student-athletes.”
Faehn was fired a day later 
after multiple regents publicly 
called for her removal to the 
Detroit Free Press.
Karas confirmed to The Daily 
that Manuel addressed the team 
this week, though she declined 
to comment on the nature of 
that conversation.
For 
the 
players, 
Friday’s 
meet was a chance to move past 
the turmoil. It was a chance 
to celebrate freshman Natalie 
Wojcik, an emerging star; an 
opportunity to speculate on a 
team brimming with potential; 
a day to move past a controversy 
that was never in their control, 
into a future that will be.
“We were doing it without 
(Faehn) before and we can 
continue to do it without her,” 
McLean said. “Whatever we 
have in ourselves is whatever 
we need. We have whatever we 
need to make the best of it.”

Wojcik earns third-straight title in home opener

It’s been more than just a big 
week for Natalie Wojcik. You 
could say it’s been her month.
Three weeks ago, in the 
opening meet of the season, 
the freshman gymnast broke 
Michigan’s record for highest 
score in a collegiate debut with 
a near perfect 39.625 — good 
for the all-around title at the 
Cancun Classic.
One week later, in front of 
10,000-plus fans in Tuscaloosa, 
Ala., she claimed that honor 
again and won the individual 
vault and balance beam events.
Wojcik’s 
breakout 
performance 
in 
her 
first 
competition 
with 
the 
Wolverines 
landed 
her 
a 
selection as Big Ten Gymnast 
of the Week. In just two weeks, 
she 
had 
already 
received 
recognition 
as 
Big 
Ten 
Freshman of the Week. Twice.
But Friday night, when the 
award ceremony wrapped up 
and Wojcik’s name was called 
for her third all-around title in 
three weeks, the achievement 
had 
new 
meaning — she 
had done it at 
home.
In 
an 
animated Crisler 
Center, 
Wojcik 
stole the show 
with 
a 
meet-
high 
39.325, 
aiding the No. 
8 
Michigan 
women’s 
gymnastics team to a 195.975-
194.050 conference and home-
opening victory over Michigan 
State.
Currently sitting at No. 3, No. 
6 and No. 21 in the nation in the 
vault, beam and uneven bars 
events, respectively, Wojcik has 
set a precedent of sustainable 
precision 
for 
herself 
in 
competitions this season. And 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki has 
taken note.
“She’s 
a 
perfectionist,” 
Plocki said. “She’s very in tune 
with what she’s doing, she 
gives 100 percent in practice 

every single turn she takes 
every day. And that shows 
up on the competition floor 
with 
confidence 
and 
with 
consistency.”
Wojcik’s 
performance 
on 
Friday, 
particularly 
in 
the 
uneven bars and beam rotations, 
embodied the artistry and skill 
the 
freshman 
has brought to 
the Wolverines’ 
roster 
this 
season.
Wojcik 
has 
anchored 
the 
vault, 
uneven 
bars and beam 
rotations 
for 
the Wolverines 
in 
their 
first 
three 
meets. 
Pressure is inherent to this 
role, as the anchor is the 
last gymnast to perform in a 
rotation, representing a final 
opportunity for a team to boost 
its score in any given event.
But from the moment Wojcik 
made her first leap onto the 
bars Friday, the pressure didn’t 
show. She wound up for her 
double layout, gaining speed 
as she circled the high bar. She 
released, flipping with perfect 
form.
Her feet connected with the 
mat. Flawless landing. A minute 
later, the scoreboard read 9.900.

“I do get a little bit nervous, 
but it’s more excited nervous, 
though,” 
Wojcik 
said. 
“So 
reminding myself that this is 
what I train for every day in 
practice and knowing the team 
is behind me really helps to 
calms me down.”
The 
weight 
of 
Wojcik’s 
role as anchor 
is 
especially 
evident 
when 
other preceding 
Michigan 
routines do not 
score 
as 
high 
as 
would 
be 
desired. 
This 
was 
the 
case 
on the balance 
beam 
Friday 
night, 
and 
the squad was looking for a 
knockout ending from Wojcik 
to head into the floor exercise 
with a significant edge over 
Michigan State.
As 
Wojcik 
gracefully 
executed a switch leap followed 
by a split jump, she couldn’t 
have looked more composed 
on the thin beam. The gymnast 
transitioned 
from 
a 
back 
handspring into a back layout 
without any signs of slipping 
following the flip. She finished 
with a clean dismount and 
stuck the landing.
Again, Crisler erupted. This 

time, the board flashed 9.950 — 
her top beam score thus far this 
season. 
“That moment when I landed 
my dismount and had everyone 
cheering and high-fiving me 
was really exciting,” Wojcik 
said.
Added Plocki: “Her beam in 
general, is like, 
exquisite. 
She 
puts the artistry 
in 
artistic 
gymnastics. 
She’s beautiful, 
everything 
is 
so precise and 
perfect — and 
that’s from focus 
and repetition.”
As 
a 
top-
scoring gymnast 
on a top-ranked program the 
past three weekends, Wojcik is a 
strong link on a team brimming 
with young talent, one that 
includes powerhouse freshmen 
in Maddie Mariani and Abby 
Brenner, who regularly hit solid 
routines in competition.
“This is definitely going to 
be a team that’s hopefully going 
to peak as we continue to go 
through the season,” Plocki 
said.
And if the best is yet to come 
for Plocki’s team, the potential 
for a dominant Michigan season 
is looking pretty bright.

‘M’ offense flails in loss at Wisconsin

MADISON — Thirty minutes 
after Michigan’s first loss of 
the season, John Beilein was 
asked about the Kohl Center. He 
started to give a stock answer, 
complimenting the crowd, the 
venue and so on. Then he stopped 
himself.
“People don’t lose here because 
it’s the Kohl Center,” Beilein said. 
“They lose here because of the 
style of play that Wisconsin plays. 
They don’t beat themselves, and 
they’re just tough to play. There’s 
so many good places in the Big 
Ten and this isn’t one we say, ‘Oh, 
we don’t wanna go to the Kohl 
Center.’ We say, ‘We don’t want to 
play Wisconsin, cause they’re so 
good.’ ”
This year, it’s unclear just how 
good the Badgers are. They sit at 
12-6 after boosting their resume 
by handing the Wolverines their 
first loss of the season on Saturday, 
64-54. They are likely on track to 
make the NCAA Tournament but 
still sit a tier below the Big Ten’s 
best.
What is clear is this: Wisconsin 
forced Michigan to play on its 
terms Saturday.
Each team had 64 possessions. 
They were slow, monotonous 
and ended in frustration more 
often than not. That’s Wisconsin 
basketball.
The Wolverines didn’t make 
a 3-pointer until late in the first 
half. By the time the game was 
over, they had made just 5-of-18. 
When they tried to get inside, they 
were met by a wall in the form of 
Nate Reuvers. When they tried to 
run the floor, they turned it over. 
When they tried to play in the 
half-court, they turned it over still, 
finishing with 16.
And Michigan, a team whose 
calling card has been that five 
different 
people 
can 
be 
its 
offensive lodestar, had no offense 
at all.
Redshirt junior forward Charles 
Matthews, the Wolverines’ most 
comfortable midrange shooter, 
scored all of five points when the 
Badgers spent the game daring 
Michigan 
to 
take 
midrange 
shots. Sophomore guard Jordan 

Poole, who managed to carry the 
offense in the first half, found 
himself in foul trouble and scored 
just three points in the second 
after Wisconsin switched up its 
coverage. 
Freshman 
forward 
Ignas Brazdeikis, a day after being 
asked about top-ranked Duke 
and declaring, “We feel like we’re 
definitely better than them,” was 
held scoreless.
The locker room, boisterous 
and loud with the fight song after 
each win, fell quiet when Beilein 
walked in.
“I didn’t realize it, we always 
sing the fight song after every 
win,” Beilein said. “It’s the first 
time the guys have never sang the 
fight song.”
A loss after 17 straight wins is 
as inevitable as it is painful. Any 
loss is a learning experience, but 
this one was a harsh reminder 
that Michigan still has bumps to 
smooth over — its offense being 
exhibit A.
“Tomorrow’s film session will 
dig in for our guys,” Beilein said. 
“It wasn’t exactly easy when 
you’re trying to get your guys to 
run because you’re mad at them 
after they just beat Northwestern 

by 20 points. … We have a lot of 
weaknesses. And we gotta shore 
them up.”
Other than junior center Jon 
Teske, who finished with 15 
points on 5-of-10 shooting and 
turned it over just once, it’s hard 
to pinpoint anyone who played 
particularly well on the offensive 
end throughout. Those games do 
happen, and for the Wolverines, 
they have been few and far 
between. That won’t change today 
though.
“We try to make it our 
team against their team,” said 
Wisconsin coach Greg Gard. “Our 
team defense has to be better than 
their team offense.”
Just before that, he had been 
asked what the Badgers’ defensive 
priorities were going into the 
game.
“Don’t let Michigan score,” he 
said.
“Don’t let (Zavier) Simpson 
score. Don’t let Teske score. Don’t 
let Brazdeikis score. Don’t let 
Poole score. Don’t let (Isaiah) 
Livers score. Don’t let Matthews 
score. Don’t let (Austin) Davis 
score. Don’t let (Eli) Brooks score.”
They didn’t.

Wolverines struggle down stretch

MADISON — For the better 
part of three months, the Michigan 
men’s basketball team has strolled 
to wins with minimal barriers 
along the way. With the exception 
of a 62-60 win over Northwestern 
six weeks ago, each of its 17 
victories had come by at least eight 
points.
So when the Kohl Center crowd 
rose to its feet as Wolverines coach 
John Beilein signaled for a timeout 
with four minutes to play and his 
team trailing by six, Michigan had 
no answers.
“We just needed to capitalize,” 
said sophomore guard Jordan 
Poole. “But we also haven’t been 
in a situation like this too many 
times.”
Instead of capitalizing, the 
Wolverines came out of the timeout 
and allowed the same type of 
basket they had all night — a hook 
shot by Wisconsin forward Ethan 
Happ, his 21st and 22nd points of 
the afternoon that sent the Badgers 
on their way to a 64-54 win.
On the ensuing possession, 
junior point guard Zavier Simpson 

uncharacteristically 
drove 
into 
traffic and saw his layup attempt 
stuffed at the rim. But when junior 
center Jon Teske hit a 3-pointer to 
cut the deficit to three a minute 
later, Michigan had its opportunity 
to regain control of the game.
After a free throw from Happ, 
Teske — perhaps buoyed by his 
previous make, but perhaps rattled 
by the unfamiliar situation — let 
loose again from deep. Only this 
time, there was a man in his face 
and the shot barely scraped the 
front of the rim. A D’Mitrik Trice 
miss afforded Michigan another 
opportunity to trim the deficit 
but shot selection again stifled the 
Wolverines on their next trip down 
the floor.
Poole took a dribble handoff 
beyond the arc with 20 seconds 
on the shot clock as two defenders 
closed in on him. Rather than 
assessing his options as he had 
done in a familiar 11-point first half, 
he dribbled into traffic and hoisted 
a three that never had a chance of 
finding bottom.
“I think it was only the 
Northwestern game was the game 
that we went down to the wire like 
this,” Poole said. “You know, which 

shots you can take, which shots you 
can’t, clock management. It’s just 
little things like that that you won’t 
be able to see in the game if you win 
by eight, nine, 10.”
Added Beilein: “Those are not 
good plays down the stretch. If we’d 
already gone through that once, it 
might have helped us today.”
Even after the Badgers extended 
their lead to six on the next 
possession, Michigan wasn’t quite 
dead yet. Sophomore forward 
Isaiah Livers hit a three on the next 
possession to bring the Wolverines 
within three, but it remained 
uncharted territory.
So, faced with a situation that 
he hasn’t been in for nine months, 
Beilein 
called 
for 
freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
to 
intentionally foul Happ — a 49 
percent free throw shooter — off 
the ball.
The only problem? The rule 
book.
A flagrant 1 personal foul is 
a personal foul that is deemed 
excessive in nature… Examples 
include but are not limited to: … 
Fouling a player who is clearly away 
from the ball who is not directly 
involved with the play.
The Wolverines had not had to 
overcome a late deficit all season, 
and it showed. The basketball 
execution was there — Brazdeikis 
did exactly as he was told, Livers’ 
three was a beautiful step-back 
jumper and Simpson forced a pair 
of steals down the stretch. The 
decision making — on and off the 
court — was not.
“One of the big things is we 
haven’t had the opportunity to 
grow from losses,” Beilein said. 
“And we needed that growth today, 
because we weren’t as good as we’d 
like to be.”
On the other sideline, Wisconsin 
had already lost a trio of Big Ten 
games by a combined 15 points. 
Down the stretch, their motto was 
“unfazed.”
“It’s strictly about mentality,” 
said Badgers coach Greg Gard. 
“And the mentality to fight through 
adversity. You’re gonna have some 
days when things don’t go well, 
how do you respond?”
The problem for Michigan? The 
last time it had one of those days 
was in April.

MADISON — On the floor of the 
Kohl Center, there was madness. 
Players and fans and coaches 
rushed the court, a mass that 
exuded exuberance.
In the Michigan locker room, 
there was quiet.
After every other game this 
season, the No. 2 Wolverines (17-1 
overall, 6-1 Big Ten) had sung the 
fight song. On Saturday, for the first 
time, they didn’t. That’s a festivity 
reserved for wins, and Michigan 
had fallen, finally, to Wisconsin 
(12-6, 4-3), 64-54. There were 
turnovers and missed baskets 
and an all-around ugly offensive 
performance 
and 
finally, 
the 
Wolverines, undefeated no more.
“We just weren’t able to knock 
down shots,” said junior center Jon 
Teske. “The mistakes, we forced. 
… We had some dumb turnovers. 
That’s not us.”
The turning point came with 
Michigan up one six minutes into 
the second half. Teske fought for a 
board and attempted a half-court 
pass to sophomore guard Jordan 
Poole, but Poole couldn’t corral it 
and Badger forward Ethan Happ 
grabbed the ball just before it went 
out of bounds, then took it down 
the court for a layup. Suddenly, 
Wisconsin was up one and it only 
cascaded from there.
Once Wisconsin took the lead, 
Happ took over, icing the game 
almost 
single-handedly. 
Alley-
oop. Another dunk. Hook shot. 
Rebound. A couple free throws. 
The Wolverines, ultimately, had no 
answers as the Badgers slowly built 
their lead.
“We always feed off (Happ’s) 
energy,” said Wisconsin guard Brad 
Davison. “ … It’s infectious to the 
rest of the team.”
The first half was relatively 
inconspicuous for both teams. 
For long stretches, sophomore 
guard Jordan Poole was the only 
Michigan player who could find 

the basket — and during the final 
stretch of the game, he sat on the 
bench with four fouls. At one point, 
neither team scored for 2:54 before 
Poole hit a jumper that capped off 
an odd 8-0 run for the Wolverines.
Then things started getting 
ugly for Michigan. Wisconsin 
took a timeout after a charge on 
sophomore forward Isaiah Livers 
and promptly went on a 7-0 run 
spurred by Happ and forward 
Aleem Ford to put the Badgers up 
four.
At halftime, the Wolverines’ 
two-point lead seemed almost 
undeserved, given the number of 
missed shots, bad possessions and 
turnovers, not to mention a 1-for-
7 mark from 3-point range. And 
in the second half, it caught up to 
them.
“When you’re playing a really 
good team, anybody has (16) 
turnovers against a team that 
doesn’t turn it over is not gonna win 
any games,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “Their defense is just 
so good in contain.”
And though Michigan had some 
good individual performances — 
junior guard Zavier Simpson, Poole 
and Teske all finished with double 
digit points — it was all ultimately 
too much. The crowd and the 
turnovers and too many trips down 
the court with nothing to show for 
it left the Wolverines gasping for 
air.
With just a minute left, freshman 
forward Ignas Brazdeikis — who 
scored zero points for the first 
time all season — was called for an 
intentional foul off the ball, sending 
Happ to the line, where he hit 1-of-
2. On the ensuing possession, Happ 
made a layup, then a defensive 
rebound that led to a dunk.
Another turnover and another 
foul 
on 
the 
Wolverines 
sent 
Davison to the charity stripe with 
four seconds left. He made both 
free throws to provide the final 
dagger.
After the game Michigan had, it 
was all too appropriate.

A

fter a mostly meaningless 
December win against 
Binghamton — a game 
in which Michigan didn’t play 
particularly 
well, but still 
blew by the 
Bearcats — 
you couldn’t 
be faulted 
for looking 
forward.
Big Ten 
play was 
about to 
resume. The 
Wolverines were undefeated 
with a program-record start 
within reach. The questions 
were inevitable.
Do you think about being unde-
feated?
Michigan men’s basketball 
coach John Beilein shot down 
any such idea instantly.
“We talked about, the goals 
this year weren’t to be undefeat-
ed,” Beilein said. “The goal was 
to win all our home games, so we 
did that. Compete for a Big Ten 
championship, that’s still in front 
of us. … So just take it a little bit 
by little as we go forward, but we 
don’t talk about going undefeat-
ed and there hasn’t been a team 
go undefeated since ’76, is that 
right? So we don’t talk about it.”

The thing about a winning 
streak, though, is that it’s impos-
sible to avoid talking about 
it, especially when it meets 
its demise. On Saturday, the 
fifth-ranked Wolverines fell to 
Wisconsin, and the questions 
switched from handling the 
pressure of a streak to how they 
would move on.
There was another significant 
thing Beilein said at that press 
conference after Binghamton. 
The question was again about 
being undefeated. But the 
answer was about learning.
“It’s really hard to keep that 
going,” Beilein said. “We’d prob-
ably prefer it the other way. … 
That certainly was sometimes 
where they needed to get their 
memory jogged about how we 
got to that point was incredible 
defense, incredible attention to 
detail, et cetera.”
Beilein said he’d prefer an 
early-season loss or two because 
it’s harder to remind the team 
of that when it hasn’t faced 
adversity. In that sense, Satur-
day — where the defense failed 
to contain the Badgers’ Ethan 
Happ and Michigan gave away 
16 turnovers — was one hell of a 
memory jog. Going forward, that 
could help the Wolverines.
Friday afternoon, freshman 

forward Ignas Brazdeikis was 
brash and confident, letting 
the world know that he wasn’t 
scared of any team. The next 
day, he scored zero points and 
was instructed to intentionally 
foul Happ off the ball, leading 
to a flagrant foul that completed 
Michigan’s unraveling.
Brazdeikis hadn’t had a day 
like that before. He’d scored 
double-digit points in all but two 
games and never put up a goose 
egg. He’d never experienced the 
eerie silence of a post-loss locker 
room, a stark contrast to the 
loud, confident atmosphere after 
a win.
For everyone else, too, it 
had been a while since they’d 
made mistakes like that, been 
outplayed like that or lost like 
that. Other than a 62-60 scare 
in Evanston in early December, 
there hadn’t been any semblance 
of trouble all season. Now that 
they’ve hit some struggles, the 
Wolverines are better equipped 
to correct them.
“We don’t usually make those 
mistakes,” said junior center Jon 
Teske after the game. “But for 
some reason we did, and we’ll 
learn from this and we’ll grow 
from this.”
That, above all, is what Beilein 
was talking about after the 

blowout against the Bearcats. 
There’s a reason the last team 
to go undefeated was over 40 
years ago. Every team, no matter 
how good, is going to have one 
of those games. All of Beilein’s 
goals are still attainable. Michi-
gan is still perfect at home. The 
Big Ten title is still within reach.
Last weekend, the Wolverines 
were simultaneously reminded 
about what made them great 
before and what mistakes to cor-
rect in the future. The schedule 
will only get tougher as the sea-
son goes on, with road contests 
against Indiana and Iowa and 
home games against Minnesota 
and Ohio State in the next two 
weeks. So as tough as it is to see 
any streak end, perhaps the loss 
came at just the right time.
“You’re a victim of your own 
success in the sense that any 
losses will magnify, and that’s 
really not the truth,” Beilein 
said. “The truth is the schedule 
is much different in the first 18 
than it is in the last 13. … So, it’s 
when you try to explain that to 
your team, without taking away 
confidence and without scaring 
them for the future. You try to 
make sure they know who our 
team really is, what we’re capa-
ble of, things like that. A loss is a 
loss, learn from it and move on.”
Inevitably, the questions 
about the streak will die down 
now that it’s over. No longer will 
every win be potential history, 
and no longer will any loss be the 
end of something. Instead, Mich-
igan can focus on the strengths 
that led to the streak in the first 
place and the weaknesses that 
ended it. It is only with both of 
those together that the Wolver-
ines can become the best version 
of themselves.
And that’s just the way Beilein 
wants it.
