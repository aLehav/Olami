University 
of 
Michigan 

alumni Frances and Kenneth 
Eisenberg, as well as the 
Eisenberg 
family 
overall, 

donated $10.75 million last 
Thursday to the University’s 
Depression Center to fund 
research projects for mental 
illnesses such as depression 
and bipolar disorder.

Kenneth Eisenberg said in 

a press release his family’s 
goal was to find solutions 
to 
meaningfully 
treat 

this 
widespread 
disorder, 

emphasizing 
the 
need 
to 

challenge 
existing 
negative 

perceptions held in society.

“It is time to put our energy 

and resources into finding 
solutions 
for 
depression,” 

Eisenberg 
said. 
“Everyone 

has been touched by a loved 
one or friend affected by 
mental illness. Our family’s 
goal is to remove the stigma 
associated with this disease 
and to provide the necessary 

financial support to assure 
that meaningful treatment is 
accessible.”

According to the National 

Center 
of 
Mental 
Health, 

depression can reveal itself 
differently across individuals, 
with 
symptoms 
including 

persistent 
sad, 
anxious 
or 

empty 
moods; 
feelings 
of 

hopelessness and pessimism; 
and loss of interest or pleasure 
in hobbies. Data collected 
from National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey 
the Center for Disease Control 
distributed 
from 
2009 
to 

2012, 7.6 percent of people 12 
years of age and older in the 
United States suffered from 
depression at any given two-
week period.

Globally, about 350 million 

people suffer from depression, 
and it is one of the main causes 
of disabilities.

Marc Edwards, professor of 

civil engineering at Virginia 
Tech, delivered the Walter 
J. Weber Jr. Distinguished 
Lecture 
in 
Environmental 

and 
Energy 
Sustainability 

to an audience of about 100 
students, faculty and staff 
Tuesday at the Gerald Ford 
Presidential Library.

The annual lecture, which 

is organized by the College of 
Engineering, brings experts 
in environmental engineering 
and science to the University 
of Michigan to share their 
work and ideas for the future 
of their fields.

This year’s lecture, “The 

Flint 
and 
Washington 

D.C. Drinking Water Lead 
Crises: How Scientists and 
Engineers 
Betrayed 
the 

Public Trust,” focused on 
Edward’s role in exposing 
water 
contamination 
in 

Washington 
D.C. 
between 

2001 
and 
2004 
and 
the 

current water crisis in Flint. 

Edwards is the researcher 
responsible for investigating 
and uncovering misconduct 
on the part of scientists at the 
Environmental 
Protection 

Agency 
and 
the 
Centers 

for 
Disease 
Control 
and 

Prevention.

In his remarks, Edwards 

talked about the aftermath 
of exposing the failures of 
scientists 
and 
politicians 

in 
charge 
of 
protecting 

public health during both 
disasters, saying both times 
it caused a lack of trust in the 
government.

Some students leave film portraying violent behavior by fraternities, sororities

At a mandatory screening of the 

film “HAZE” Tuesday, a pseudo-
documentary 
that 
explores 
a 

negative and violent depiction of 
University of Michigan fraternity 
and sorority life, more than 120 
members of Greek life left after a 
contentious debate during Q&A 
with the film’s director, David 
Burkman.

At least ten members of each 

fraternity 
and 
sorority 
were 

required to attend the Office of 
Greek Life event.

Most of the students who spoke 

during the Q&A voiced opposition 
toward the violent and graphic 
images within the film, and said 
the behavior portrayed in the film 
is not reflective of what happens 
in Michigan Greek life. Students 
also said because the Michigan 
Panhellenic Association is self-
governing, there is a system of 
accountability 
that 
prevents 

intense hazing like that shown in 
the film.

In 2013, Alpha Epsilon Pi was 

accused hazing its pledges and 
their president was removed, and 
in 2011 Sigma Alpha Epsilon was 
expelled by the Interfraternity 
Council.

The 
film 
portrays 
hazing 

with jarring canted angles and 
black-and-white shots dispersed 
throughout. One scene, which was 
brought up by multiple students 
during the Q&A, depicted a pledge 
class 
violently 
attacking 
and 

killing a dog. The film also staged 
the portrayal of a pledge member’s 
alcohol-poisoning-induced 
death and the sexual assault of a 

freshman sorority member.

Information 
senior 
Sarah 

Barnitt asked the director about 
the film’s portrayal of women in 
the Greek life system, and how 
much stereotypes surrounding 
sorority culture played a part in 
the construction of its characters. 

“As a member of Panhellenic 

Executive board, that image that 
you constructed sorority women is 
not accurate and it is not flattering, 
and it’s actually kind of offensive,” 
Barnitt said. “To be honest, it’s 
offensive to women as a whole

the possibility of new legal actions 
against the original polluter that 
could potentially bypass state 
environmental regulators.

Improper wastewater disposal 

by the Ann Arbor-based company 
Gelman Sciences — which has 
since been purchased by Pall 
Corporation — from 1966 to 1986 
has created a large plume of

“We’re 
talking 
about 
a 

dark side of science and 
engineering 
in 
academia,” 

he said. “I’m going to tell 
you 
today 
that 
we 
have 

failed miserably in terms of 
honoring that public trust.”

In the first part of his 

lecture, Edwards described 
the 
efforts 
of 
several 

government agencies in D.C. 
to cover up the effects of the 
lead outbreak in the water 
supply, calling whistleblowing 
efforts partially a way to 
uphold the duty of scientists 
to the public good.

“This 
crime 
was 

perpetrated by government 
scientists 
and 
engineers,” 

he said. “It was an EPA 
regulation that inadvertently 
caused lead to fall into the 
water.”

In particular, he cited the 

Centers for Disease Control’s 
response 
to 
the 
outbreak 

as 
deficient, 
noting 
the 

government agency falsified 
a report denying any effects 
from the water crisis.

“The 
U.S. 
Centers 
for 

Disease Control came into 
town and derailed any hope 
of holding the perpetrators 
of this crime accountable,” 
he said. “In defiance of 2,000 
years 
of 
human 
history, 

dozens 
of 
peer-reviewed 

papers, the CDC found that 
there is no evidence that kids 
in D.C. drinking all this water 
with high levels of lead were 
harmed.”

Edwards 
compared 
the 

mishandling of the D.C. water 
crisis to the current crisis in 
Flint, which has had elevated 
levels of lead in its water for 
at least the past two years 
after a switch in the source of 
their water caused lead from 
the pipes to leach into the 
water.

“Governments do not do a 

good job of fixing problems 
that they create,” he said. 
“The lead pipes are there 
because of a bad law that 
required them. The consumer 
had no choice.” Edwards also 
emphasized that the series of 
steps required to prove to the 
government 
and 
American 

public that the crisis in Flint 
was real and had negative 

health 
impacts 
aimed 
to 

be 
both 
comprehensible 

and 
understandable.“We 

sent sampling kits to Flint 
residents to sample the water 
for lead,” Edwards said. “We 
also did simple experiments 
that anyone, even a reporter, 
can understand.”

After Edwards conducted 

several 
more 
public 

experiments 
following 
the 

state government’s refusal to 
repeat his previous tests, he 
received the media coverage 
that attracted the attention of 
the country to the crisis.

“By early October (2014), 

it was front cover of The 
New York Times,” he said. 
“It wasn’t long before all of 
America and much of the 
world 
learned 
that 
what 

happened in Flint, Michigan 
was 
an 
environmental 

crime perpetrated by our 
government against one of our 
most vulnerable populations 
in this country.”

LSA freshman Alec Kefgen, 

who attended the event, said 
he was surprised to hear that 
nobody in the Washington 
D.C. water crisis was held 
accountable. He said he was 

glad several perpetrators 
in the Flint crisis are 
being prosecuted.

“I 
heard 
that 
the 

government wasn’t really 
helping 
or 
supporting 

(the Flint community),” 
he said. “I was happy to 
see people got indicted. In 
the future, people can see 
what has happened, see 
the work that (Edwards) 
did, and be more open to 
the effects.”

Chemical Engineering 

Prof. Suljo Linic said he 
thought 
the 
audience 

would 
benefit 
from 

hearing more about the 
crises directly from those 
affected.

“We hope that many 

students, 
faculty 
and 

colleagues 
have 
an 

opportunity 
to 
hear 

first hand what really 
happened, 
what 
went 

wrong and what can be 
done differently so that 
these kinds of things do 
not happen in the future,” 
he said.

and 
depression 
disorders 

comprehensively, focusing on 
medical research, clinical care, 
education and public policy.

The Eisenberg’s gift will 

mainly be used for medical 
research. John Greden, founder 
and executive director of the 
center, said the gift will help 
fund 
projects 
that 
aim 
to 

uncover the underlying causes 
of the illnesses, which will 
allow clinicians to personalize 
treatments for each patient with 
depression or bipolar disorder.

“Depression 
and 
bipolar 

illnesses probably have multiple 
different causes,” he said. “If we 
have multiple causes, we’ve got 
to treat the underlying causes … 
one-sized treatment will never 
fit all. We want to know: Will 
this type of depression respond 
to this antidepressant or this 
anti-inflammatory agent or this 
new medicine that will alter 
the genetic message? Then we 
can choose the treatment that 
precisely targets the underlying 
cause.”

LSA senior Reid Depowski, 

secretary for a new student 
group 
at 
the 
University’s 

Counseling and Psychological 
Services, 
CAPS 
In 
Action, 

wrote in an email interview 

that she thinks personalizing 
depression 
treatment 
has 

the potential to be highly 
impactful.

“Depression 
is 
such 
a 

widespread illness that not 
everyone responds the same 
to treatment or understands 
their symptoms in the same 
ways,” Depowski wrote. “Our 
Depression 
Center 
intends 

to 
focus 
on 
the 
personal 

development of those seeking 
treatment for their depression, 
which I think is a great step 
in the right direction to client-
focused therapy specifically to 
that client.”

Depowski also said the gift 

could spark conversations on 
campus about the necessity of 
research and the importance of 
mental health for everyone.

“That’s the goal of our group 

— 
to 
destigmatize 
mental 

health, mental illness, and 
make it normal to talk about,” 
she wrote.

The gift also established the 

Frances and Kenneth Eisenberg 
Professorship of Depression 
and Neurosciences. The first 
recipient of the professorship 
was Psychiatry Prof. Srijan Sen, 
whose goal is to develop more 
effective 
and 
personalized 

treatments for those who suffer 
from depression.

One 
of 
Sen’s 
ongoing 

research projects focuses on the 

relationship between stress and 
depression in medical interns. 
Sen said medical interns are 
appropriate models for his 
research because they suffer 
from high stress — working 80 
to 90 hours a week, suffering 
from sleep deprivation and 
dealing with life and death 
situations with their patients 
for the first time.

Sen said he hopes to further 

his study with the medical 
interns 
through 
his 
newly 

received 
professorship 
by 

utilizing mobile and wearable 
technology, which will allow 
him to get real-time and more 
reliable and objective data from 
his subjects.

According to Sen’s research, 

the rate of depression increased 
from 
3.9 
percent 
in 
the 

beginning of the internship 
to almost 27.1 percent during 
the internship. He added that 
depression in interns presents 
a risk to patients, noting that 
the young professionals are 
more likely to commit medical 
errors.

“Rates of depressions are 

very high, especially in (the 
medical intern) population,” 
Sen said. “It is important for 
health 
care 
to 
understand 

what’s causing the high rate 
of depression — finding ways 
to decrease it is important for 
them and for their patients.”

other design projects similar to 
this greenhouse.

“I had read about Walipinis, 

which are theses underground 
greenhouses in the Andes, and 
they grow things like bananas 
at crazy high altitudes and 
crazy high temperatures,” she 
said. “I think a lot of gardeners 
in 
Michigan 
get 
depressed 

when winter comes and wish 
that they could grow for longer 
and 
extend 
their 
growing 

season.”

Project 
co-collaborator 

Steven Mankouche, Murray’s 
husband 
and 
an 
associate 

professor of architecture at the 
University of Michigan, said the 
greenhouse was inspired by a 
love of gardening. But now that 
it’s nearing its completion, the 
potential for more greenhouses 
in Detroit has become apparent.

“The project never started as 

us wanting to help people; we 
started the project as wanting 
to see if this idea would work,” 
he said. “While I think it does, 
I hate to talk about the project 
as if we are out there to help 
people and as if that were the 
mission of the work, which is 
not the case.”

The greenhouse plan was 

conceived of in 2009, according 
to the couple, but it took a 
few years for them to find the 
right house for the project. An 
additional year of fundraising 
after the house on Burnside 
Street was chosen and the plans 
were laid out in 2013 was also 
necessary for the project to 
launch.

“We 
wanted 
to 
find 
an 

abandoned 
house 
that 
was 

fire 
damaged 
and 
could 

not be saved,” he said. “We 

wanted the house to be in a 
neighborhood that wasn’t a 
fringe neighborhood with not 
much around it; we wanted it 
to be in a neighborhood where 
people lived but that was still 
struggling.”

Mankouche 
said 
the 

neighborhood, informally called 
by the primarily Bangladeshi 
residents “Banglatown,” seemed 
to be a good fit because there 
was still what he referred to as 
a “neighborhood fabric” intact 
in the area despite the burned 
and derelict houses scattered 
amongst the houses of the 
residents.

Now the project is coming 

close to a conclusion, with 
several final steps remaining. 
The 
last 
touches 
include 

installing stairs that will lead 
to the sunken lower level of 
the greenhouse, which was 
completed 
last 
week, 
and 

bringing in and spreading soil. 
Mankouche 
said 
after 
soil 

is spread inside Afterhouse, 
it will be ready for the first 
round of planting. Some of 
the first plants will include 
small 
trees 
that 
require 

warmer temperatures that are 
not available during Detroit 
winters, 
including 
bananas, 

olives and pomegranates.

Mankouche said the house is 

roughly 600 square feet with a 
completely open interior. The 
sunken base is approximately 
five feet below ground level.

“We 
removed 
the 
house 

from the foundation up, and 
in that process of demolition 
we salvaged all the structural 
lumber from the house,” he 
said. “We were left with the 
bare foundation wall, which 
was concrete block wall, which 
required a lot of repair work.”

Murray said an underlying 

concern within the project was 

building a lasting infrastructure 
in the area and finding residents 
that would continue to use 
the final product well after it 
reached completion.

“One of the things that was 

always really important to us 
when we were looking for a 
site and looking for the right 
partner to work with or give it 
to was that it would be useful 
and wouldn’t just be another 
thing that’s falling down,” she 
said. “We will help maintain it 
over the next couple of years 
to make sure that everything 
is working and to troubleshoot 
problems.”

As of right now, Afterhouse 

will primarily be used by 
Burnside Farms, the community 
garden that operates across the 
street from the greenhouse. 
The 
garden 
will 
use 
the 

greenhouse 
to 
extend 
its 

growing season through the 
winter. Mankouche said he 
thinks that the greenhouse can 
give back to the community by 
enabling the farm to continue 
growing throughout the winter 
that it can give to members of 
the neighborhood.

Burnside Farms could not be 

reached for comment.

Murray 
said 
from 
her 

experience 
working 
with 

members of the “Banglatown” 
community, 
there’s 
high 

potential 
for 
growth 
in 

community gardening.

“There are a lot of structures 

that can be repurposed that way, 
and there are a lot of people 
who are using gardening and 
growing their food to empower 
people,” she said. “If you live in 
a place where fresh fruits and 
vegetables aren’t that easy to 
come by, they are easy to come 
by in your backyard.”

Mankouche also noted that 

the small size of the Afterhouse 

design helps it fit into the 
neighborhood, and the approach 
that they’ve taken — demolishing 
the house but retaining the 
original foundation — allows 
for 
a 
variety 
of 
different 

community-oriented 
designs 

to be incorporated into future 
projects, such as residential 
scale swimming pools or skate 
parks.

On top of potential for other 

uses, 
Mankouche 
said 
the 

completed Afterhouse is not 
necessarily the final product 
and that the maintenance of 
the original foundation means 
that the structure could be 
repurposed again for something 
else.

“It allows for a future for 

the house,” he said. “It’s like 
putting a cap on the house; 
there’s 
nothing 
that 
would 

stop someone from converting 
Afterhouse back into a house 
again.”

“I think that it can have 

a very positive effect on the 
neighborhoods and the reason is 
because it’s not a big structure, 
it 
pretty 
much 
replaces 
a 

house unlike, let’s say, a large 
greenhouse and things of that 
nature, and so just because of 
its residential scale and the 
fact that it is in the location of 
a house itself, it tends to have 
a different type of rapport as 
a piece of architecture than a 
piece of art would,” he said.

University 
alum 
Travis 

Williams 
worked 
with 

Stephen and Murray on the 
Afterhouse 
project 
through 

the 
Undergraduate 
Research 

Opportunities Program. He has 
volunteered 
throughout 
the 

entire project, including during 
the initial design phases, and 
despite graduating this past 
spring, plans to help until the 
project is completed.

A native Detroiter, Williams 

said he was excited by the idea 
of working on a project that 
would revitalize a home that 
had been completely abandoned 
and left to break down among 
the houses of residents in the 
neighborhood.

“The way it served as an 

intermediary between blighted 
out 
homes 
and 
new 
home 

owners, I was delighted to work 
on it,” he said. “Seeing it go 
from a dilapidated home that 
was firebombed and complete 
desolation to seeing what we 
could deconstruct and salvage 
and completely rebuild it to a 
whole new design and use, it’s 
been enlightening.”

An 
aspiring 
architect, 

Williams 
said 
working 
on 

the project has helped him 
understand how to bring in 
community input to influence 
design and planning, as well 
as the role that communities 
themselves 
play 
in 
efforts 

to 
rebuild 
the 
houses 
and 

neighborhoods around them.

“(Steven) was more receptive 

and took more of a participatory 
role from the community itself 
and the people that it would 
actually house and serve, and 
listened 
to 
their 
thoughts,” 

he said. “That was a very big 
teachable 
moment, 
where 

it showed me the role that 
communities can play in their 
own reinvention, and have to 
play in their reimagining.”

Mankouche said since the 

project is nearing completion, 
he is interested in reaching 
out to other communities and 
working with others on similar 
projects in the future, though he 
said he does not want to be the 
one who build them anymore.

The 
couple 
believes 
the 

precedent set by the project 
has the potential to change 

the approach that the city of 
Detroit takes to demolishing old 
and broken houses. Beyond the 
risks and technical knowledge 
required to safely demolish a 
house, Mankouche said it is 
feasible for communities to 
come together to construct new 
buildings using old foundations 
in the way that Afterhouse does.

“I think it absolutely is a 

project that can be done by 
smaller 
communities,” 
he 

said, mentioning that several 
people from the immediate 
neighborhood surrounding the 
Afterhouse project volunteered 
time to help build the structure.

To 
demolish 
and 
rebuild 

the house cost Murray and 
Mankouche 
approximately 

$5,000 in total, a process they 
contracted out. According to an 
article written by The Atlantic, it 
costs the city of Detroit roughly 
$12,000 to fully demolish a 
derelict house, which includes 
removing the foundation and 
filling in the hole in the ground 
that is left behind.

Both Mankouche and Murray 

noted that one obstacle relevant 
to 
demolition 
projects 
for 

both the city of Detroit and 
the Afterhouse project is that 
without the proper permits 
for renovation, the city doesn’t 
allow for partial demolition. 
This means that to reduce costs 
by saving the foundation of 
houses, Detroit would have to 
take a remodeling approach, 
rather than demolition. 

“If the city changed the 

ordinance in such a way that 
one was allowed to demolish 
and leave the existing first floor 
intact, because all these houses 
are platform framed, you could 
then go about it quite safely and 
give time to the community to 
go about rebuilding a house,” 
Mankouche said.

GREENHOUSE

in that you constructed them as 
sluts and bitches who are there 
to entertain men in fraternities. 
I just wanted you to know that is 
not Greek life at Michigan.”

Barnitt’s comment was met 

with applause and catalyzed the 
departure of most of the audience.

“What I hope to accomplish 

tonight is to get a conversation 
going about what we can do to 
prevent this from happening,” 
Burkman said as students exited 
the auditorium. “So if you’re not 
willing to have the conversation at 
all, then you’re not open-minded. 
I don’t want to offend anyone and 
(Barnitt) is perfectly entitled to 
her opinion, but I think everyone 
is entitled to their opinion, 
including me. I firmly believe 
that this is a powerful tool for 
constructive change.”

Producer 
Jayme 
Aronberg 

expressed 
surprise 
and 

disappointment at the reaction 
of the majority of the student 
audience to the film, which has 
won multiple awards, including 
the 
D.C. 
Independent 
Film 

Festival’s best feature film, and 
has been screened at dozens 
of film festivals and college 
campuses across the country.

“This is the first time that 

we’ve ever had this reaction,” 
Aronberg said. “First time. Maybe 
the truth is that Michigan does 
an exceptional job at not having 
(hazing incidents) happen. If that’s 
the case, then that’s amazing. But 
it is also important to recognize 
that’s not the case everywhere. 
And that’s disturbing.”

The 
makers 
of 
“HAZE” 

have 
been 
traveling 
around 

the country screening the film 
exclusively at universities before 
the commercial release, which is 
slated for the spring of 2017.

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily 
before 
the 

screening, 
Burkman 
said 
he 

hadn’t initially planned to tour the 
film to college campuses.

“When we set out to make the 

film, it was not with any specific 
agenda in mind other than to 
make an entertaining, thought-
provoking, illuminating feature 
film,” Burkman said. “The film 
has taken on an unexpected life 
of its own by virtue of its subject 
matter.”

Burkman, 
an 
Indiana 

University alum, was invited to 
screen the film at his alma mater 
and said he was struck by the 
effect that the film could have in 
generating conversation around 
the problems in Greek life and 
hazing. After the film started a 
dialogue at Indiana University, 
Burkman decided to screen the 
film exclusively at colleges before 
its commercial release.

“It wasn’t our original intention, 

but when we went to Indiana, it 
was really fascinating to see what 
an incredibly productive tool the 
film could be in generating a kind 
of 
constructive 
conversation.” 

Burkman said.

He acknowledged the disturbing 

nature of the film, but said he felt it 
necessary to fully relate the horrors 
of hazing to the audience.

“Our 
hope 
is 
that 
the 

conversation doesn’t end when we 
leave campus, when the lights go 
up and the film is over,” Burkman 
said. “I think it’s important to 
have a film that shows this thing in 
a realistic way, that upsets. While 
I do not want to upset people and 
traumatize people, we made this 
film with the hope that it would 
get under people’s skin.”

HAZING
From Page 1A

The 
gradually 
expanding 

plume, first discovered in 1985, has 
contaminated groundwater, forced 
the closure of more than 100 private 
residential wells and is expected 
to reach the Huron River in the 
coming decades and potentially 
contaminate Ann Arbor’s water 
source at Barton Pond, according 
to several projections.

In 
2006, 
a 
court 
ruling 

denied the city of Ann Arbor 
the right to be a party in a state 
of Michigan lawsuit and 1992 
consent judgement against Pall 
Corporation, 
which 
mandated 

the corporation undertake the 
monitoring and remediation of 
the contamination. Because Ann 
Arbor was denied involvement 
in the lawsuit, the Michigan 
Department 
of 
Environmental 

Quality, not the city, is primarily 
responsible for overseeing the 
polluter’s remediation efforts.

However, the discovery last 

week of 1,4-dioxane in the shallow 
groundwater at Waterworks Park 
by the MDEQ has sparked new 
concerns of human exposure, 
and some city officials are now 
entertaining the possibility of 
a new legal action against Pall 
Corporation that would make the 
city of Ann Arbor a party.

The 
contaminants 
in 

Waterworks 
Park 
were 
in 

concentrations of 2 to 3 parts 
per billion. 1,4-dioxane carries 
carcinogenic risk at 3.5 parts 
per 
billion, 
according 
to 

Environmental Protection Agency 
guidelines.

City 
Councilmember 
Chip 

Smith (D–Ward 5) — whose 
constituency includes Waterworks 
Park — said he hopes new legal 
action, either to make the city 
a party to the state’s lawsuit 
or a new suit altogether, could 
allow it to bypass the MDEQ and 
possibly push for a full cleanup. 
He added that he considered the 
MDEQ unreliable in managing the 
contamination.

Smith confirmed this option 

was discussed, among several 
other legal options — including a 
petition to the EPA for superfund 
designation — during a closed-
door special session of City Council 
Monday night, though he declined 
to offer more specific details.

“I believe that we need to be 

somehow as a party in some of 
the judicial actions,” Smith said. 
“(Washtenaw 
County 
Circuit 

Court Judge Donald) Shelton said 
10 years ago … this is between the 
DEQ and Gelman. I believe that is a 
flawed way of thinking since it’s the 
people of Ann Arbor who are most 
directly impacted by this and the 
DEQ clearly has not represented 
the citizens here adequately.”

City 
Councilmember 
Sabra 

Briere (D–Ward 1), who serves 
on 
the 
City 
Environmental 

Commission, was also open to 
the possibility of a new legal 
action against Pall. Briere told 
the Daily before Monday night’s 
special session that the new 
discovery of contaminated shallow 
groundwater may grant the city 
grounds to pursue this option.

“Until 1,4-dioxane was found 

in shallow groundwater, the city 
had no evidence of immediate risk 
to the health of the community,” 
Briere said. “Now, with the 
discovery of 1,4-dioxane, that may 
change.”

When asked about specific 

legal strategies the city could take 
and what was discussed during 
Monday night’s special session, 
Chief Assistant City Attorney 
Abigail Elias declined to comment 
but reiterated that the city is 
considering all available options.

Several 
other 
city 
council 

members also declined to discuss 
the proceedings of Monday night’s 
special session when reached for 
comment.

Meanwhile, other jurisdictions 

in the county — including Ann 
Arbor Township, Scio Township 
and 
the 
County 
Board 
of 

Commissioners — have sought to 
bypass the MDEQ altogether.

eeing 
the 
classic 
call 

me when you get a sec 
text from my stepdad 

Tuesday morning, I knew my 
day was about to get much 
worse. Walking out of East 
Hall to a quiet place to call him 
back felt like a lifetime. I was 
soon informed of a series of 
events that led to my mom in 
the ICU after her salt levels fell 
dangerously low sometime late 
Monday night. She had tremors, 
couldn’t speak and her doctors 
were concerned about possible 
brain damage from the drastic 
change in equilibrium. After 
I hung up the phone with my 
stepdad, uncertain about the 
true gravity of my mother’s 
physical state, all I could think 
about was how lucky I was that 
it was raining and my tears 
would be hidden as I walked 
back to my apartment.

Upon arriving home, I had 

exactly one hour to bawl my eyes 
out, collect myself to continue 
on with my day and make myself 
presentable. All my friends were 
in class, so I was very much alone 
with only thoughts of the worst-
case scenarios. Even worse, I 
felt guilty for feeling sad and 
spending so much time thinking 
about how my mom was doing 
because I had homework to do 
and office hours to attend.

Though my mom will be 

fine and was released from 
the hospital on Monday with 
high hopes for her mental 
capacity after a bit of therapy, 
I can’t help but question my 
instinct to hide emotions and 
attempt to power through my 
classes 
and 
extracurriculars 

like nothing ever happened. 
There is something about the 
college environment and fast-
paced lifestyle of trying to 
succeed in life that seems to be 
incompatible with, well, life.

The activities and classes we 

have to complete to advance 
ourselves into a future career 
hinder our ability to live as 
human beings and experience 
pain in the ways that are 
necessary to carry on with 
the day. How could I continue 
learning 
organic 
chemistry 

and taking care of the cells in 
lab and volunteering if I wasn’t 
capable of taking care of myself 
and my own mental state first? 
I couldn’t; I was dysfunctional 
and my work ethic suffered. 
I should’ve taken the time to 
allow myself to cope with the 
realities of my family life before 
I continued trying to go about 
my school life. However, this is 
easier said than done.

These hindering pains in life 

don’t have to be catastrophic 
either. Seemingly insignificant 

hiccups 
can 
have 
negative 

consequences for our everyday 
lives. I can’t tell you how much 
time I have wasted on being 
upset after getting a point off one 
quiz. Sometimes it takes hours 
for me to truly grasp the fact that 
the one point I lost out of 400 will 
not be likely to hurt my grade. 
But this is the environment we 
live in, one focused on achieving 
and 
striving, 
sometimes 

forgetting about simply living 
and surviving.

We 
walk 
around 
each 

and every day together on 
this campus, each with our 
own problems and thoughts, 
unaware of what the people 
around 
us 
are 
feeling 
or 

experiencing. I doubt any of the 
people I encountered over the 
past week would’ve guessed 
I was struggling internally 
and, in their defense, I tried 
my best to hide any indication 
that 
something 
could 
be 

wrong. As human beings, we 
should 
allow 
ourselves 
to 

break down sometimes, to be 
dysfunctional, even with the 
most mundane of things.

We should allow ourselves to 

experience the pain and stress 
of our lives and not drown 
in responsibility. We should 
actively create an environment 
— not only for ourselves, but 
also for others — where mental 
health and emotional well-
being are just as important as 
the grades and accolades we 
strive to achieve.

Policy still matters

MAX RYSZTAK | COLUMN

A

fter a long, hype-filled 
summer prepared us 
for 
the 
showdown 

between Donald Trump and 
Hillary Clinton, we are finally 
done with presidential debates 
for the 2016 election season. 
Unfortunately, these debates, 
if 
anything, 
hurt 

the morale in this 
country and severely 
damaged 
our 

political credibility.

In 
what 
are 

typically 
policy-

intense, 
mature, 

educated discussions 
about the direction 
presidential 
candidates wish to 
take this nation, this 
year’s debates lacked substance 
or 
meaningful 
discussion. 

While in past cycles one-
liners often stole the show, 
the debates themselves were 
usually 
extremely 
detail-

oriented 
and 
professional. 

Mitt Romney and President 
Barack Obama’s 2012 debates 
were 
intense, 
but 
policy-

oriented. 
Their 
discussions 

always 
remained 
civil 
and 

constantly referred to certain 
tax 
percentages, 
specific 

legislation or their differences 
when it came to policy.

Not this year.
Unfortunately, with Trump 

and 
Clinton, 
we 
arguably 

endured 
the 
three 
most 

immature political debates in 
this nation’s history. The two 
candidates attacked each other 
personally. 
Petty 
bickering 

drowned out what little real 
policy was discussed, like when 
Trump referred to Clinton as 
“the devil.” Candidates spoke 
about topics ranging from each 
other’s 
marriage 
fidelity 
to 

Clinton’s email scandal, and it’s 
embarrassing. 

It seems as if both candidates’ 

strategies were to tear each other 
down, to argue against the other, 
instead of running on a positive 

message based on their own 
proposals. This type of rhetoric 
highlights their desperation to 
win for themselves and not for 
the people.

The only positive moment 

from all three debates was 
when 
the 
candidates 
were 

asked to say one 
thing they respected 
about 
the 
other. 

Clinton referred to 
Trump’s 
children, 

symbolizing 
his 

strong 
role 
as 
a 

father. Trump called 
Clinton 
someone 

who can “fight hard” 
and “doesn’t quit.” 
This was one of the 
few times in any of 

the debates when the candidates 
came across as respectful. It 
shows what this country and 
what our politics have the 
potential to be, but sadly, the 
candidates went back to the 
same old tactics the next day. 

Our 
debates 
demonstrate, 

on a larger level, the increasing 
irrelevance 
of 
policy 
in 

politics. When our presidential 
campaigns and debates largely 
focus on personal traits or 
actions, and not on policy, we 
don’t get to hear the candidates 
talk about the real issues. We 
deserve debates in which we 
learn what they actually want to 
do on topics that will affect each 
and every one of us.

When politics aren’t focused 

on policy, it affects all of us down 
to the most grassroots level. 

We are faced with heightened 
tensions in our communities, 
in our classrooms and all over 
campus because all we hear our 
leaders do is attack one another 
on anything but their ideas. I’ve 
seen political differences strain 
relationships on this campus, 
peers judging others for their 
disagreement, students calling 
one another names because they 
think differently. A lot of this is 
fueled by Trump and Clinton’s 
campaigns. They divide us more 
than they unite us, which many 
are failing to recognize.

So where do we go from here?
While it seems too late 

to change the tone of this 
campaign, 
changing 
the 

political discourse starts with 
us, with those involved at the 
grassroots 
level 
of 
politics. 

Having educated discussions 
on policies and ideas, and 
not on candidates, will serve 
those beyond our campus. We 
should seek out conversations 
in which we can learn others’ 
justifications for their opinions. 
Learning how to deal with 
the opinions of the opposition 
in a respectful and informed 
way can quickly spiral into a 
meaningful change of discourse.

For now, we just have to get 

through the next few weeks of 
this election and suffer for only 
a little while longer through 
an embarrassing political cycle 
until we can look forward to 
the next election. Hopefully, 
by then, we will have learned 
from 
our 
collective 
voting 

mistakes this year. Maybe we 
can even become more diverse 
in opinions and more educated 
on 
actual 
solutions. 
And, 

hopefully, we will nominate and 
have the opportunity to vote for 
candidates with real and positive 
proposals for this nation, because 
policy still matters.

E

arlier 
this 
month, 
a 

Walmart executive gave 
a 
surprising 
campus 

talk. Chief Sustainability Officer 
Kathleen McLaughlin outlined 
how the company is raising 
wages, reexamining relationships 
in its supply chain to limit 
environmental 
degradation 

and working in communities to 
broaden economic opportunity. I 
was impressed, yet while walking 
out of the Ross School of Business, 
I wondered if other businesses — 
like an independent shop on South 
U — could have the opportunity 
to act for environmental, social 
and economic justice. Walmart 
must be an exception, I thought. 
It’s so large and successful that 
it dictates business terms. Its 
success translates into having 
money to spend on new initiatives. 
I felt unconvinced others could, 
or would, follow their lead.

This skepticism was deflating, 

producing a sense that nothing 
can change. It led to another 
feeling that many students and 
adults, particularly those just 
entering the workforce, might 
relate to: In a world with more 
than 7 billion people, there’s little 
one can do to make a net impact.

Bernie 
Sanders’ 
visit 
to 

campus, 
however, 
served 

as 
a 
counterpoint 
to 
this 

way 
of 
thinking. 
Smaller 

businesses alone may not affect 
environmental, 
economic 
or 

social structures, but individuals 
can. Young people have made 
Bernie’s campaign a success 
by 
collectively 
expressing 

principles 
they 
value 
and 

demanding change on issues like 
college affordability.

Economists call what many 

Bernie supporters have done “foot 
voting.” The original idea said 
that individuals with preferences 
for taxes and services move to 
the cities within a region where 

the taxes they pay and services 
they purchase have maximal 
utility for society as a whole. 
One’s location reveals what he or 
she wants and values, and other 
actors in the market see this and 
adjust accordingly.

Critics, like The New York 

Times’ op-ed contributor Mark 
Schmitt, have argued Bernie’s 
campaign displays the limits 
of collective action by young 
people. His supporters shouted 
loudly, but the campaign likely 
accomplished little in the long 
run. Others might conclude the 
issues that young people can affect 
are limited. They can demand 
ethically sourced products, yet 
have little influence on larger 
issues like the minimum wage 
or trade agreements. Business 
students might echo this point, 
arguing 
bottom-line 
analyses 

determine business decisions, not 
aspirations or values.

But the reality is starkly 

different, both on and off campus. 
Many of us already vote with 
our feet every day when making 
routine purchases. For example, 
Espresso Royale serves fair trade 
coffee, in part because many 
students care what goes into their 
cups. A similar story explains 
Chipotle 
serving 
“responsibly 

raised” meat.

Demanding 
products 
that 

are fair to individuals, and to 
the communities that produced 
them, doesn’t have to be a luxury 
either. McDonald’s is removing 
GMOs and antibiotics from its 
foods, largely in response to 
changing consumer awareness 
and preferences. Target has aisles 
of sustainable supplies. As more 
people think about the origin and 
impact of their purchases, what 
originally seemed like small-
scale activism transforms into 
systematic changes: Companies 
like Walmart adapt. Others will 

follow or be forced to follow.

Though purchases are likely 

the most common way students 
vote with their feet, the most 
impactful choice we make may 
be what we do after graduation. 
Thousands of businesses recruit 
University of Michigan graduates 
each year. We’re in demand, 
and in this way, we’re not 
unlike Walmart in that we have 
bargaining power.

Campus 
recruiting 
is 
an 

opportunity 
to 
exhibit 
your 

priorities and influence those of 
large businesses. When sorting 
career opportunities by prestige, 
salary or visibility, also consider 
asking questions that reflect 
your values, like “What is its 
impact on local communities?” or 
“How are employees addressing 
discrimination?” Employers will 
notice which booths are the most 
popular at career fairs and adapt. 
What we do after graduation can 
create a ripple throughout the 
labor market.

But 
small-scale 
activism 

on campus doesn’t have to be 
restricted 
to 
older 
students 

thinking about post-college plans, 
or those with spending money. 
Project Callisto, a sexual assault 
reporting system, offers another 
example of students effecting 
meaningful change. It started 
last year with two schools where 
students 
advocated 
for 
new 

solutions to the sexual violence 
endemic on campuses. Now in 
its second year, it’s working with 
many more universities, receiving 
funding 
from 
Google 
and 

influencing policy in Washington.

As students, we should vote 

with our feet more often, on 
more issues, even after the 
November elections.

20TH CENTURY FOX

Okay, but in what universe does Zach Galifinakis land Isla Fisher?!

George 
Lucas, 
the 
brains 

behind 
the 
“Star 
Wars” 

franchise, purportedly hung up 
a release date for 
“The 
Phantom 

Menace” 
while 

filming. No matter 
what, he told his 
cast 
and 
crew, 

the 
film 
would 

be released on a 
specific 
date. 
It 

can’t be much of a 
surprise that “The 
Phantom Menace” 
lacked the nuance and heart that 
defined the earlier films, since 
Lucas’s team didn’t have the 
freedom to think through the 
film before its release.

That same predetermination, 

and its accompanying general 
disregard 
for 
the 
craft 
of 

filmmaking for profit’s sake, is 
vividly on display in “Keeping Up 
with the Joneses,” a spy action 
comedy 
from 
20th 
Century 

Fox and the latest project from 
“Adventureland” and “Superbad” 
director Greg Mottola.

Jeff 
Gaffney 
(Zach 

Galifianakis, “Birdman”), a nerdy 
and relatively socially inept HR 
manager at a large industrial 
facility in suburban Atlanta, and 
his wife, Karen (Isla Fisher, “The 
Great Gatsby”), become caught 
up in an espionage plot when they 
discover their new neighbors are 
government agents. The smooth, 
suave and stylish neighbors, Tim 
and Natalie Jones (Jon Hamm, 
“Mad Men,” and Gal Gadot, 
“Batman v. Superman: Dawn 

of Justice”), charm everyone 
around them, who all work for 
the same company with Gaffney, 
into revealing critical secrets.

The film, miserable as it 

is, does deserve some credit. 
An exhaustive list of its attri-

butes include: a 
decent (but very 
brief) title cred-
its sequence, a sly 
Nigerian 
prince 

reference, 
three 

“Veep” cast mem-
bers, 
a 
Busby 

Berkeley-inspired 
indoor 
skydiving 

sequence and two 
good songs (one 

by Blitzen Trapper, another by 
Anderson .Paak). That is, unfor-
tunately, the end of the list.

The film certainly defies 

expectations to the extent that I 
expected to see an action come-
dy. Rather, we are left with a film 
constructed from the tropes left 
behind by other superior films. 
There is one action sequence 
and fewer laughs. The prede-
cessors of “Keeping Up with the 
Joneses,” films like last year’s 
brilliant 
“Spy,” 
“The 
Other 

Guys,” and even “Date Night,” 
are funnier while being more 
drastic and creative in throwing 
average Joes into high-stakes 
action stories. They are simply 
more entertaining. 

But “Keeping Up with the 

Joneses” is nothing more than 
a failure. The film is beyond 
predictable, wearing its fore-
shadowing on its sleeve. The 
score, written by Jake Monaco 
(“Dinotrux”), seems to be stolen 
from other action comedies. The 
story is dull, using a slow reveal 

of facts (which, by the way, 
could be deduced by watching 
the trailer) until the plot is made 
clear way more than halfway 
through the movie. Galifiana-
kis, Fisher and Hamm have all 
proven their comedic chops but 
they are all each given just one 
joke to continue throughout the 
film; they lack complexity and 
the film just lacks fun. Gadot, or 
at least her performance, lacks 
any sense of comedy and she is 
reserved as simply a sex object, 
surely at the studio’s request.

But what’s most frustrating 

about the film, even more than 
its abject failure at simple film-
making technique (the film is 
horribly lit), is its unearned con-
fidence. Scenes that are meant 
to be clearly funny moments 
feel completely distant, as if 
studio executives thought, “Oh, 
this will surely get the audience 
laughing. Let’s stylize it, throw 
in some slow motion to capital-
ize on those laughs.” What is 
most troubling is that Mottola’s 
earlier films, especially, for me, 
“Adventureland,” strongly suc-
ceeded where his latest fails: 
comedy should flow naturally, 
not calculatedly or mechani-
cally.

The film’s marketing cam-

paign included an appeal as a 
great date movie. It can only be 
assumed that it would suit those 
who pay to see a movie then turn 
away from the screen and make 
out the whole time. I suppose, 
then, it fulfills the base require-
ment of a date movie in that 
it is, in fact, a movie. In other 
words, distracted audiences are 
encouraged, all others should 
avoid.

Don’t bother ‘Keeping Up’

20th Century Fox

Rave & Quality 16

Michigan’s Jazz Ensemble 

will be playing at this year’s 
20th 
Annual 
Edgefest 
in 

Kerrytown. With a heavy lineup 
of performers and 
presenters, 
this 

year is expected 
to 
be 
bigger 

and 
better 
than 

in 
years 
past. 

Originating 
in 

1997, Edgefest has 
premiered a wide 
variety 
of 
jazz 

artists 
from 
all 

over the country in 
the decades since 
its inception.

Jazz 
pianist 

and composer Ellen Rowe has 
been a part of Edgefest since 
the beginning. However, her 
passion for jazz and her career 
began much earlier.

“In junior high and high 

school, jazz was more unique 
… not a lot of other musicians, 
especially 
women, 
were 

pursuing it,” Rowe said. “It was 
creative and allowed for a large 
degree of self-expression. I just 
loved the spirit and sense of 
community.” 

Rowe went on to create 

compositions and arrangements 

and lead her own jazz quartet. 
The Arizona Daily Star praised 
her when as a “rare ‘triple 
threat’ of pianist, composer-
arranger, and teacher ... the best 
possible role model …”

Not only is Rowe the director 

of the University of Michigan 

Jazz 
Ensemble, 

but she also works 
as the professor 
and chair of Jazz 
& Contemporary 
Improvisation.

The Michigan 

Jazz 
Ensemble 

has 
been 

preparing 
for 

Edgefest 
with 

other professors 
and 
composers. 

The 
members 

of 
the 
band 

are 
required 
to 
practice 

individually, 
in 
addition 
to 

rehearsing with their section 
and with the band altogether.

The first half of their concert 

this Friday will be a jazz piano 
concerto with composer and 
performing 
arts 
technology 

Professor of Steve Rush at the 
piano, with additional soloists 
from the ensemble. The second 
half will be a collaboration with 
award winning percussionist 
and composer Jon Hollenbeck. 

“He is in town once every 

couple years,” Rowe said. “So 

when students get the chance 
to play his music, it’s pretty 
special.”

Although 
the 
Michigan 

Jazz 
Ensemble 
will 
only 

be 
performing 
one 
night, 

Edgefest will be filled with 
iconic jazz artists, performers 
and 
composers 
throughout 

the week. The performances 
range from individuals to small 
quartets to entire bands.

“This year’s lineup is stacked. 

We are a lot more interesting as 
improvisers and composers,” 
Rowe explained.

Edgefest is unique to the 

Ann Arbor community because 
it only comes around once a 
year, and it allows room for 
non-traditional jazz artists to 
present their work. Rowe noted 
that “contemporary, improvised 
jazz is not generally on people’s 
radios, and they are not getting 
exposed to it. Some people have 
not experienced it.”

However, Rowe believes that 

it’s vital for people to hear this 
type of music and specifically, 
this type of jazz, adding that 
Ann Arbor often provides that.

“Ann 
Arbor 
has 
been 

somewhat of a leader in the 
country for presenting real 
contemporary 
music,” 
Rowe 

said.

Edgefest is a prime example 

of that kind of presentation.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

For many an awkward teen, 

myself almost certainly among 
them, music is often a way of 
feeling part of something, and is 
a way of escaping everyday life.

Being a teenager is that time 

in your life when you’re teetering 
on the edge of finding out who 
you are and what you like. You’re 
figuring out what kind of clothes 
you like to wear, what kind of 
jokes you find funny and arguably 
one of the most important, you 
find out what kind of music that 
you enjoy.

A lot of our music taste comes 

from those near us, especially 
those that we look up to, 
including our friends and what 
we see people listening to on the 
internet. Often there’s the singer 
(or band) of the moment, with 
prime examples being Justin 
Bieber and One Direction, who 
are known as having fanbases 
made of pre-teen girls. Whenever 
this is talked about, it is often 
derogatory, as if it’s bad to have 
this kind of fan. There’s several 
things that I find unsettling 
about this frame of mind, and 
it’s taken me a long time to digest 
and even realize that there’s 
something off with this way of 
thinking.

These young girls are no less a 

fan of music as anyone else on this 
planet is. Does being young make 

them less of a fan? No — as boys 
seem to never have this problem. 
Am I trying to insinuate that this 
is some form of sexism? Maybe, 
but I don’t want to detract from 
what I’m really trying to say.

Why do we view young girls 

as lesser fans of artists? It can’t 
possibly be due to the amount 
of money that they spend on the 
artist — think of the sheer amount 
of One Direction paraphernalia 
that has been floating around 
from the very inception of the 
band. Parents are never more 
willing to spend money than 
when it involves indulging their 
children, and getting them lots 
of merchandise of their favorite 
band would definitely be a part of 
that.

Is it a way of insulting the 

artist, by referring to how all their 
fans are young? Again, why is it so 
terrible to have a large amount of 
loyal fans, regardless of their age 
and gender?

Surely, the blatant stereotyping 

of fans in this situation is 
something that is unhealthy 
and 
shouldn’t 
be 
something 

that’s so commonplace in the 
world of music. Music is often 
a form of escapism and allows 
people to express themselves 
and what they’re interested in. 
Theoretically, this should be 
an environment in which other 
people’s opinions and passions 
are accepted and we can learn 
from each other by seeing what 

other people listen to.

I find nothing more satisfying 

than finding a new band and going 
through their albums, especially 
if someone has suggested their 
music to me. Discussing music 
has generally always been a safe 
conversation topic, and people are 
normally respectful. However, 
often hearing how other people 
in the music scene refer to fans 
of other bands, I wonder if this 
is becoming less true. Artists 
themselves are now more open 
about their likes and dislikes of 
other artists on social media, 
and this can lead to “fan wars” 
or straight up cyberbullying 
between groups.

I believe that musicians have a 

responsibility to be role models. 
Even if they are a small local 
band, there are still people paying 
to see them play and who look up 
to them. There is a built-in part 
of this that involves showcasing 
politeness and respect to others 
in the music industry, and with 
social media allowing artists to 
have such contact with their fans, 
this is now more important than 
ever.

The music industry is bigger 

than ever. It has the ability to bring 
thousands of people together at 
one for their love of music, yet it 
is also so divisive. It would be so 
much easier if people saw this 
difference as a great positive, 
instead of something that needs 
to be argued about.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

THE CW

When he says if you had a twin he’d still choose your twin.

When it premiered last year, 

“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” seemed to 
be nothing more than a whimsical, 
goofy TV show about a 
girl who takes a crush 
too far. As the season 
progressed, it evolved 
into an unorthodox 
look at mental health 
and 
relationships. 

Buried in the silliness 
of each episode were 
moments 
of 
truth. 

Season one of “Crazy 
Ex-Girlfriend” was a 
fresh, witty profile of 
people desperate for 
companionship 
and, 

more 
importantly, 

love.

Season two moves away from 

the crazy things people do to find 
a relationship to the even crazier 
things people do to stay in one. 
The theme song, historically 
serving as a thesis statement for 
the season, begins with “I’m just a 
girl in love.” Clearly, this season is 
all about being together, not apart 
— whatever it takes.

Surprisingly, the first healthy 

relationship 
shown 
in 
the 

episode is Paula (Donna Lynne 
Champlain, 
“Birdman”) 
and 

Scott 
(Steve 
Monroe, 
“Miss 

Congeniality”), whose marriage 
was on the rocks for much of the 
first season. In their kitchen, they 
talk about normal, happy, healthy 
couple things like the arrival of 
their sex harness from Amazon 
Prime, kids and of course, Rebecca 
(Rachel Bloom, “Robot Chicken”) 
and Josh (Vincent Rodriguez, 
“Donny!”). For the first time since 
Paula joined Team Rebecca, she is 

not supportive of the relationship.

And what exactly is Rebecca 

and Josh’s relationship? It can best 
be described as a “live-in booty 
call.” They’re having sex and it’s 
clearly on Josh’s terms … despite 
the fact that he is now living 

with Rebecca. 
His refusal to 
sleep in bed 
with her is the 
first red flag 
that although 
Rebecca finally 
gets to be with 
Josh, 
she’s 

still in denial 
about 
the 

truth. 
“Love 

Kernels,” 
a 
hilarious 

homage 
to 

Beyoncé’s 

“Lemonade,” further explores the 
nature of the unequal relationship. 
Rebecca is so desperate to keep 
the relationship alive that she will 
trick herself into believing a 3:00 
a.m. “You Up?” text means love.

Both songs in the episode 

focus solely on Josh and Rebecca. 
This raises the question of 
what kind of season this will 
be. The songs usually heighten 
the main storylines of each 
episode; “Love Kernels” and 
“We 
Should 
Definitely 
Not 

Have Sex Right Now” make it 
apparent that Rebecca and Josh 
is the most important storyline. 
Season one spent so much time 
curating relationships and quirky 
characters that it’s important to 
see the payoff in season two. Will 
a 
relationship-themed 
season 

allow for that, or will it hurt the 
ensemble quality which makes 
the show so special?

Specifically missing from the 

first episode were two of those 

charming supporting characters, 
Darryl (Pete Gardner, “Project 
X”) and White Josh (David Hull, 
“The Middle”). Their storyline 
was in the episode just enough to 
make sure viewers didn’t forget 
about them. However, the pur-
pose of their presence, to cement 
the theme of “crazy for love,” was 
all they contributed to the epi-
sode. Similar to Paula and Scott, 
Darryl and White Josh are anoth-
er established, happy couple used 
to represent the overall shift from 
loneliness to love.

The only lonely person is prob-

ably the show’s most sympathetic 
character, Greg (Santino Fontana, 
“Frozen”). Greg’s discovery of his 
alcoholism was an unexpected 
twist, handled with exactly the 
level of humanity viewers have 
come to expect from “Crazy Ex-
Girlfriend.” His underlying issues 
— anger, escapism, self-depreca-
tion — from the first season finally 
come to fruition. If anyone in the 
cast is immediately set up for 
large personal growth, it’s Greg. 
In his poignant speech at Alco-
holics Anonymous, he shares that 
he is already “less angry.” This is 
huge for anyone who knows Greg.

It looks like “Crazy Ex-Girl-

friend” is poised and ready for 
another season of finding love 
and 
happiness 
through 
the 

worst possible methods. Already, 
Rebecca has taken a normal ges-
ture (giving someone a drawer) 
to unreachable heights (installing 
“The Entertainer” to play in said 
decked-out drawer). It’s exciting 
and a little scary to see what is 
in store for the characters.With 
Rebecca Bunch, a little goes a 
long way (from New York to West 
Covina, for example). Where, oh 
where, will she take viewers this 
season?

Damn 

Daniel clips. After 
their 
video 
went 

viral on Twitter, they 
received 
a 
special 

mainstream 
media 

treatment: 
a 
guest 

spot on Ellen DeGe-
neres’s talk show, an 
appearance at a movie premiere 
and a lifetime supply of white Vans.

Their spontaneous fame made 

me ponder: How is it that the 
online community becomes so 
obsessed with ordinary people 
doing strange, funny things? But 
digging even deeper, I ask myself: 
why do some people go viral and 
become famous right away and 
others don’t?

Of course, this idea of “short-

term” versus “long-term” fame 
isn’t a new concept. It traces back 
way before social media became 
the catalyst for celebrity. When 
YouTube was created in 2005, 
it was just a rudimentary video-
sharing site, gradually churning 
out clips of Rick Astley singing and 
shrill-voiced oranges that garnered 
thousands of views. But with the 
rise of social media and expansion 
of the Internet’s accessibility, You-
Tube started to function as a well-
oiled business for inspired content 
creators waiting to be discovered. 
It’s where people like Bo Burnham, 
Rachel Bloom and Issa Rae all got 
their start.

Still, it’s hard not to see how 

absurd it is that some people, such 
as the Damn Daniel duo, get acci-
dentally recognized by all of social 
media. Is there some sort of natu-
ral selection algorithm for their 
rapid success? Is it because they’re 
attractive? Young? Wealthy? Clev-
er? Talented?

It’s possible that people who 

receive short-term fame embody 
all of those qualities. But some-

times, it all depends on luck, tim-
ing and relevance. Having a social 
media account would also be great-
ly beneficial. You could make the 
world’s funniest video, but no one 

would see it unless 
you uploaded it to 
YouTube, Vine or 
Snapchat and shared 
it incessantly over 
Facebook, 
Twitter 

and any other inter-
active 
social 
net-

working site. 

Take, for example, 

“Gangnam 
Style,” 

the unexpected 2012 
viral hit from K-pop 
star PSY. It began 

to spread virally through the vir-
tual stratosphere when rapper 
T-Pain linked the video to a Twit-
ter status in July 2012. Slowly but 
surely, “Gangnam Style” gained 
traction and soon, more celebrities 
like Katy Perry, Tom Cruise and 
Britney Spears saw the video and 
encouraged others to do the same. 
As it garnered an impressive two 
billion views, the video sped up to 
the most liked video on YouTube, 
which also earned PSY a spot in the 
Guinness Book of World Records.

An online celebrity was born 

and, as with every Internet sensa-
tion, PSY was immediately thrust 
into America’s version of fame. His 
song topped the Billboard charts. 
It spawned imitators, spinoffs and 
mashups. PSY even got a Pistachio 
commercial out of it, for Pete’s 
sake. And all of this fame, fortune 
and notoriety was because another 
famous person tweeted about his 
song.

PSY attempted to make another 

hit with his 2013 single, “Gentle-
man.” Though the music video 
racked up to almost 1 billion views, 
it failed to reach the monumental 
viral heights of “Gangnam Style.” 
Thus, the name PSY became a dis-
tant memory and now it seems as 
though the South Korean pop star 
has found himself in the virtual 
void of other forgotten viral clips. 
Trends come and go. America 
laughed, danced, sang along and 
now, we’ve moved on. 

But the question still lingers: 

What is it about Damn Daniel, 

“Gangnam Style” and other popu-
lar videos that make them go viral? 
Bo Burnham, Issa Rae and Rachel 
Bloom all are immensely talented 
people, but somehow it took longer 
for them to achieve the same level 
of success. They were definitely 
well-known among the YouTube 
community, garnered a healthy 
amount of views and developed 
loyal fan bases, but they never got 
the same treatment the Damn 
Daniel guys received.

That may have been for the bet-

ter, though, considering that each 
of their individual journeys to 
stardom were ultimately worth-
while in the long run. Bloom won a 
Golden Globe for the CW’s “Crazy 
Ex-Girlfriend”; Burnham created 
three acclaimed live stand-up spe-
cials; Rae just got her big break as 
star, creator and writer of the HBO 
comedy “Insecure.” 

Then again, there could be mul-

tiple reasons behind what dictates 
the duration and lasting effect of an 
online person’s fame. Perhaps it’s 
sensationalism created by main-
stream media or our generation’s 
constant yearning for the spotlight. 
It may be as simple as how silly 
and strange the video is and how 
willing we are to share with our 
friends.

Who’s to say who gets to be 

famous on the Internet and who 
doesn’t? Are there Virtual Pow-
ers That Be that exist? Is this the 
work of the Illuminati? Sometimes, 
short-term fame can sustain for a 
bit, especially given that the Damn 
Daniel dudes are still somewhat 
active — they recently partnered 
with LG USA to star in a cutesy, 
R&B-tinged commercial that nods 
to their infamous catchphrase. 
But for the most part, online fame 
is fleeting. Yet, it still happens all 
the time.

The Internet is a strange and 

infectious place, a virtual expanse 
that has redefined what it means 
to be relevant, to exist beyond and 
transcend the barriers of celebrity. 
It’s within our nature to discover 
and obsess over something fun 
and interesting, but we also pos-
sess the power to either keep it fun 
and interesting or let it falter into 
the cracks of utter nothingness.

The mysteries of who gets famous and why on the Internet

SAM 

ROSENBERG

6A — Wednesday, October 26, 2016

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

THE CW

It’s not a CW show until someone’s husband gets shot.

Nearly 
every 
time 
I 
tell 

someone my favorite show is 
“Jane the Virgin,” I get some 
sort of laugh, like 
I’m telling a joke. 
Still, 
after 
two 

excellent seasons, 
I have to explain 
why a show that 
starts 
with 
a 

virgin 
getting 

accidentally 
artificially 
inseminated 
is 

one of the best on 
television 
right 

now. 
Everything 

this show does is a high-flung 
tightrope act. It could easily go off 
the rails in a second, but nothing 
in the brilliant season three 
premiere suggests that’s going to 
happen any time soon. Through 
its resolution of the cliffhangers 
from last season as well as the 
perfect way it hits its emotional 
beats, the episode reminds me 
exactly why I love this show.

“Jane” ’s season premiere 

picks up exactly where season 
two left off, with Jane (Gina 
Rodriguez, 
“Deepwater 

Horizon”) 
finding 
her 
new 

husband Michael Cordero (Brett 
Dier, “Ravenswood”) shot in the 
hallway outside their hotel room. 
As doctors at the nearby hospital 
try to save Michael, the series 
flashes back to the beginning of 
Jane and Michael’s relationship. 
Last season also left us with Petra 
(Yael Grobglas, “Reign”) being 
“Petra-fied” by her sister Anezka 
(also played by Grobglas), who 
takes over Petra’s life in an effort 
to exert revenge against her for 

sending their mother to prison. 

Where this premiere succeeds 

is in its emotional evocation. The 
episode spends most of its time 
with Jane and her family in the 
hospital, waiting for news about 
Michael. Watching Rodriguez’s 

heart break breaks 
my heart, as Jane 
deals 
with 
the 

possibility 
that 

Michael 
might 

die. 
The 
show 

occasionally 
touches on grief, 
and 
every 
time 

they do it’s filled 
with raw emotions, 
as everyone deals 
with it in their own 
way. 
The 
series 

illustrates this strength with 
Michael’s mother (Molly Hagan, 
“iZombie”). She tries to take over 
the decisions involving Michael’s 
health, much to Jane’s chagrin. 
Though the resolution is slightly 
forced, the story makes its point 
in a creative way.

“Jane” usually uses flashbacks 

as a framing device, and this 
episode is no exception, as the 
show frames the question of 
whether 
Michael 
lives 
with 

the story of Jane and Michael’s 
past. We’ve already seen the 
initial meeting where Michael, a 
cop, gets called to at Jane’s 21st 
birthday party, where the two 
share a kiss. But, after that night, 
Jane goes on a date with her long-
time crush at the time. Although, 
as the episode told us, we knew 
how the story would end, it was 
still compelling to see a piece 
of their relationship we haven’t 
seen.

At its heart, “Jane” is an 

expertly 
crafted 
parody 
of 

the telenovela while being a 

perfectly executed telenovela in 
and of itself, and the premiere 
continues that trend. Petra’s 
story involves an evil twin and a 
failed attempt at romancing the 
good twin’s love interest, Rafael 
(Justin Baldoni, “Everwood”). 
These developments are two very 
common telenovela tropes, but 
they’re so wonderfully executed. 
Though Petra may be in a hospital 
bed with no ability to move, I’m 
excited to see where they take 
this story in future episodes. 
There’s also the love story 
between Rose (Bridget Regan, 
“White Collar”) and Louisa (Yara 
Martinez, “Alpha House”), which 
took another twist in last year’s 
finale with Rose emerging from 
the dead and taking Louisa away 
with her. The big final twist of the 
premiere is Louisa waking up to 
find out she’s underwater. It’s the 
kind of “WTF” twist the show 
has pulled off so many times 
before, and I’m looking forward 
to seeing how they justify it.

All this is colored with elements 

of “Jane” which are familiar, but 
so strong. Anthony Mendez’s 
(“The Unexplained Files”) work 
as the “Latin Lover Narrator” 
remains stellar, as he guides us 
through the journey into Jane’s 
past and Petra’s tough situation. 
There’s also the clever onscreen 
text that helps insightfully push 
the story forward. 

The season three premiere of 

“Jane the Virgin” wasn’t radically 
different from any episodes that 
came before it, but that doesn’t 
matter. It had the pure love and 
emotion that has defined it for 
its entire run, as well as the 
telenovela-esque twists and turns 
that I’ve come to expect from it. 
I love this show, and this episode 
was another reminder of why.

A

“Jane the Virgin”

Season Three 

Premiere

Mondays at 9 p.m.

The CW

“Yet despite all these things we 

know to be true — despite the pre-
ponderance of evidence showing 
the mental and emotional distress 
people demonstrate 
in violent and harass-
ing 
environments 

— we still have no 
name for what hap-
pens to women living 
in a culture that hates 
them.”

This is the driving 

issue of Jessica Val-
enti’s first memoir: 
“Sex Object; a Memoir.” One of the 
newest books to join the feminist 
shelf, this memoir sets itself apart 
from books like Rebecca Solnit’s 
“Men Explain Things to Me” or 
Andi Zeisler’s “We Were Femi-
nists Once: From Riot Grrl to Cov-
erGirl®, the Buying and Selling of 
a Political Movement” in that Val-
enti doesn’t bother with statistical 
evidence beyond the absolutely 
rudimentary. She is not interested 
in proving that feminism is still 
needed or that we live in a society 
that hates women. She has lived 
in it enough to know that both of 
those are unequivocally true.

“Sex Object” is divided into 

three parts, as Valenti writes about 
childhood and adolescence, young 
adulthood and finally marriage 
and pregnancy. She details what 

it was like to go from feeling ugly 
as a young girl to being sexualized 
as she developed breasts early. 
She devotes a large portion of her 
writing to detailing how sexual 
objectification and harassment 

on 
the 
streets 

takes a toll. Over 
time, she writes, 
women develop 
a strategic abil-
ity to gauge what 
kind 
of 
reac-

tion they can get 
away with — if 
a middle finger, 
disgusted eye roll 

or a “fuck off!” will be enough to 
send the guy who yelled disgust-
ing comments at her after them.

Valenti, who founded the award 

winning 
website 
Feministing.

com in 2004, does a phenomenal 
job of describing the pressure to 
be a “cool” feminist, who uses 
barbed and witty banter to hold a 
mirror up to society, rather than 
the “angry feminist” stereotype 
— because she notes, anger gives 
enemies ammunition to dismiss 
her as hysterical or emotional. 
She argues these successful main-
stream 
feminist 
literature 
or 

comedy routines, often utilize a 
silver lining to garner support or 
approval, because no one wants to 
hear about a problem that isn’t get-
ting better as quickly as some peo-
ple say it is. As well, she describes 

the toll that being the cool girl has 
taken on her over the course of her 
life, and how she can’t do it any-
more. It’s too exhausting to try and 
make frustration and anger palat-
able to the masses. Those emotions 
are palpable in her acerbic writing; 
she doesn’t coat her words.

“Sex Object” isn’t written for 

people who still demand proof of 
the wage gap or argue that women 
don’t go into STEM fields because 
they simply don’t want to. If that’s 
something you or a friend may 
need, I’d suggest reading her other 
book first: “Full Frontal Femi-
nism; A Young Woman’s Guide to 
Why Feminism Matters.”

This memoir isn’t ground-

breaking or shocking, though 
the stories of her encounters on 
the New York City subway might 
be to some. But if you think her 
work is in any way unnecessary, 
flip to the back of “Sex Object,” in 
which she has pages of comments 
on her blogs or emails sent to her 
about her books that she has been 
receiving every day for a decade. 
They are full of rants that range 
from condescending, to disparag-
ing, to cruel, to threatening. Many 
of them tear down her physical 
appearance or her intellect, and 
a few of them are misguided and 
misspelled rages against feminism 
in general. There’s nothing Valenti 
could have used to prove her point 
more effectively.

Past beatings from Spartans not forgotten

Thinking about his last two 

visits to East Lansing, Erik 
Magnuson can only smirk and 
shake his head. Matt Godin’s 
voice is filled with frustration 
when he talks about it.

The 
last 
two 
times 
the 

Michigan football team played 
at Michigan State, in 2013 and 
2014, the Spartans outscored the 
Wolverines a combined 64-17.

Magnuson was part of an 

offensive 
line 
that 
allowed 

Michigan State to sack then-
quarterback 
Devin 
Gardner 

nine times in two years and hold 
Michigan to negative-48 yards 
rushing in 2013. Godin was on 
the defensive line at the end of 
the 2014 contest, when he felt 
“disrespected” by the Spartans 
allegedly trying to run up the 
score.

Neither 
of 
those 
players 

nor the rest of the Wolverines’ 
current 
upperclassmen 
have 

any interest in pointing fingers, 
however — they put the blame 
squarely on their own shoulders.

“I 
remember 
being 

embarrassed,” Magnuson said. 
“Last time we played there was, 
overall, just embarrassing. We 
couldn’t run the ball, we had 
trouble pass protecting. We 
think that is embarrassing, and 
the time before that was even 
more 
embarrassing. 
Those 

memories definitely stick in my 
head.”

Two years later, the two teams 

appear to be moving in opposite 
directions as they approach 
their matchup this weekend. 
Michigan is 7-0, ranked second 
in the country and aiming for 
a berth in the College Football 
Playoff. The Spartans are on a 

five-game losing streak and in 
jeopardy of even reaching a bowl 
game.

But, having been on the losing 

end in seven of their last eight 
meetings, the Wolverines refuse 
to write off their in-state rival.

“They’re a good team,” Godin 

said. “Their record doesn’t show 
how good a team they are. We 
know they’re gonna come out 
swinging, come out playing hard.”

Some 
of 
the 
youngest 

members of the team don’t even 
know what it’s like to experience 
failure. Players like freshman 
offensive lineman Ben Bredeson 
weren’t even on the sideline last 
year, when Michigan appeared 
to have Michigan State beaten 

before 
the 
last 
10 
seconds 

changed everything.

The seniors haven’t forgotten 

anything, 
though. 
Tuesday, 

Magnuson said he and fellow 
fifth-year 
senior 
offensive 

lineman Kyle Kalis watched all 
three games they had played 
against the Spartans. As they 
watched numerous plays where 
they “just didn’t do (their) job,” 
two of the most outspoken 
personalities on the Wolverines’ 
roster were reduced to silence.

This week, the seniors on the 

O-line took it upon themselves 
to make sure their younger 
teammates knew how much 
another loss like that could sting.

“Some of the younger guys 

kind of take this season for 
granted,” 
Magnuson 
said. 

“They came in here and we’ve 
been winning ever since and 
everything like that. So they 
kind of haven’t been through the 
downs, and the bad times kind of 
make you a little bit tougher. … 
We try to remind them that just 
’cause we’re 7-0 doesn’t mean 
that they’re gonna lay down and 
give it to us.”

Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh has said all year that 
his team is approaching every 
game like a championship game, 
and most of his players say that 
this week has been no different. 
Still, many of the Wolverines 
who have been around for 

several years feel they’re in a 
better mindset heading into the 
rivalry game this year.

Godin said the Wolverines 

are ready to go. Thanks to the 
championship-game mentality, 
Magnuson thinks this is the most 
mature and mentally prepared 
team he’s ever been a part of.

The on-field preparation may 

be the same, but the problems of 
the past are fueling the fire.

“You get kind of sick of 

getting beat up, you know?” 
Magnuson said. “Like the kid on 
the playground who gets beat up 
all the time — eventually you’re 
gonna get sick of it, and you’ve 
gotta get personal sometimes 
and stand up for yourself.”

Magnuson on recent losses to Michigan State: ‘You get kind of sick of getting beat up, you know?’

Horse blinders key for Speight, Michigan

Before he became such a potent 

weapon as the Michigan football 
team’s 
starting 
quarterback, 

Wilton 
Speight 
received 
a 

message from assistant strength 
and conditioning coach Mark 
Naylor. The only content was 
a photo of a racehorse wearing 
blinders.

There was no text. There 

was no further explanation. But 
Speight heard the message all the 
same.

Speight went to the same high 

school, Collegiate in Richmond, 
Va., as two current NFL players, 
Russell 
Wilson 
and 
Jake 

McGee. Wilson is a Super Bowl-
winning quarterback for the 
Seattle Seahawks, and McGee 
is a converted quarterback and 
rookie tight end for the San Diego 
Chargers. Speight followed both 
of them as Collegiate’s starting 
signal-caller. That’s when he 
developed his own set of horse 
blinders.

He 
constantly 
faced 

comparisons to both players. 
Opposing fans chanted that 
he wasn’t as good as either. 
News coverage made the same 
statements. Speight learned not 
to listen to any of it.

“And then here as a redshirt, 

I’ve kind of been written off as 
being the guy by everyone,” he 
said. “I’m just kind of natural at 
it now.”

Seven 
weeks 
into 
his 

career as Michigan’s starting 
quarterback, 
Speight 
seems 

to have mastered the focus on 
himself. Two weeks ago, he 
spent his bye week watching 
film of each of the 159 passes he 
had thrown in the first half of 
the season.

After video coordinator Phil 

Bromley and his team compiled 
all of the clips, Speight first 
watched the tape one time 

through, observing only himself. 
Then, he went through again 
and broadened his attention to 
the play. He took notes on how 
each throw developed.

With 
that 
newfound 

perspective in mind, Speight 
shifted his mindset to the second 
half of the season and delivered 
— in head coach Jim Harbaugh’s 
mind — his best performance 
of the season. His completion 
percentage of 69.6 was his best 
since the season opener against 
Hawaii. He netted 15.8 yards 
per completion. And for the fifth 
time in seven games, he did not 
throw an interception.

Speight 
agreed 
with 

Harbaugh’s 
assessment 
and 

said that, except for a couple 
of instances here and there, he 
threw the ball to the right spot. 
For the most part, he improved 

what he set out to improve after 
his comprehensive film study.

“I thought there was a few 

times earlier in the year when I 
was aiming the ball, and that’s a 
quarterback’s worst nightmare, 
is when you’re sitting back there 
with guys collapsing around you 
and you’re worried about aiming 
where the ball goes,” Speight 
said. “Whether it’s a five-yard 
pass, 10-yard pass or a deep ball, 
you just gotta let it rip.”

Now, Speight looks ahead 

once more to this weekend’s 
game at Michigan State. He 
knows how important it is, and 
he knows it will be a tough one 
despite the Spartans’ current 
five-game losing streak.

If Speight can continue his 

improvement in the second half 
of the year, he will be Harbaugh’s 
second straight quarterback to 

do so, after last year’s starter 
Jake Rudock made major strides 
down the stretch. Speight’s 
numbers have been better as 
well, and his teammates notice 
the same trajectory.

“He’s really trying to solidify 

his leadership position on the 
team, and guys are really just 
looking up to him to make 
plays,” said fifth-year senior 
wide receiver Jehu Chesson.

Speight 
issued 
the 
same 

refrain as his head coach and 
teammates about treating this 
week’s game as a championship 
game like any other. That goes 
back to his horse blinders.

A couple of times this season, 

Harbaugh — perhaps as a sign of 
Speight’s evolution as a leader 
— has called the quarterback 
in front of the team to lead an 
edition of “Wise Words,” the 

session at the end of practice 
in which one player gives 
some advice to the team. Once, 
Speight used horses’ blinders as 
a lesson.

“That’s for a reason — they 

don’t worry about what’s going 
on in the outside world,” Speight 
said. “What the media’s saying 
— no offense to you guys — what 
the media’s saying, what other 
coaches or other players are 
saying on Twitter. They just 
worry about their own lane. 
That was kind of my message to 
the team.”

Maybe 
that’s 
why, 
when 

Speight was asked Tuesday 
about the coming trip to East 
Lansing, his answer meant a 
little more.

“It’s the biggest game and the 

biggest start of my life,” he said. 
“Because it’s the next one.”

Barrage leads Wolverines past Oakland

In the final non-conference 

match of the season, Michigan’s 
offensive attack showed no 
mercy.

Following three consecutive 

scoreless 
outings, 
the 

Wolverines’ men’s soccer team 
(3-9-4) 
converted 
five 
times 

— its most 
since 2013 — against Oakland en 
route to a 5-1 victory Tuesday 
night at U-M soccer stadium.

The 
Wolverines’ 
goal 

bombardment 
was 
led 
by 

sophomore Francis Atuahene, 
who finished with two scores, 
including the game-winner: a 
conversion off of a deflected 
Marcello 
Borges 
shot 
that 

Atuahene keenly poked into the 
back of the net during the 47th 
minute. The second goal was a 
beauty, as the forward’s luminous 
yellow cleats launched a perfect 
blast from 20 yards that tucked 
just inside of the right post.

“When you’re a goal scorer, 

confidence is king,” said head 
coach Chaka Daley. “(Francis) 
scored one that was a little bit 
of a scrum, but the second was 
top-shelf.”

Atuahene 
added 
the 
10th 

and 11th goals of his sophomore 
campaign with the effort against 
Oakland — good for the team’s 
best in that category.

Senior 
forward 
Yamann 

Sahlool added two tallies of his 
own, the first of which came off 
of a penalty shot following a foul 
inside the box by an Oakland 
defender and the second via a 
header off of a set-piece from 
midfielder Tyler Anderson.

“We still want him to be a 

little bit more dangerous and in 
the box, and you noticed the two 
goals tonight were in the box,” 
Daley said. “And around the goal, 
he’s probably our best finisher.”

Michigan scored the game’s 

first goal thanks to a cross that 
evaded the Oakland defense 

and found its way to the foot 
of sophomore Robbie Mertz, 
who sent a ball passed the reach 
of Grizzlies’ goaltender Zach 
Walker for the Mertz’s third of 
the season. 

However, 

Oakland’s 
pressure 
eventually 
broke 
down 

the 
Wolverine 

defense, 
as 

a 
tilted 
shot 

total 
midway 

through 
the 

first half led to 
a 
score 
from 

Popovic Nebojsa 
in the 26th minute, knotting 
the game at one, the score with 
which the teams would enter the 
halftime locker room.

The flow of the game changed 

when a tongue-lashing by the 
Michigan coaches charged the 

team, according to Atuahene: 
“We had a lot of chances that 
we should’ve taken (in the first 
half). I get fired up when the 
coaches talk to us, scream at us — 
it pushes me up and gets the best 

out of me.”

This 

motivation 
allowed 
the 

Wolverines to 
score a total 
of four goals 
in the second 
half, turning 
a competitive 
match 
into 

a 
decisive 

victory. 

“In the second half, we didn’t 

keep the ball very well, but we 
were dangerous,” Daley said. 
“I rather have the second one, 
when we’re starving for goals 
and results. I think we showed 
Oakland a great deal of respect 

tonight. Certainly, the goals fell 
for us — we didn’t hit post, we 
didn’t miss our easy chances 
— we took our chances really 
well and scored two or three 
spectacular goals.”

Despite 
the 
success 
of 

Tuesday’s 
result 
and 
an 

upcoming 
game 
against 

Maryland 
this 
weekend, 

Michigan is locked into the 
eighth seed in the Big Ten 
Tournament 
and 
matchup 

against Rutgers for the right to 
play the top-ranked Terrapins 
the next day. But Daley remains 
optimistic in his team.

“We still believe in our group 

— very, very much.” Daley said. 
“We know it’s an uphill battle, 
but we still believe — based on the 
results and competitive nature 
of the guys, and the quality of 
their characters. We’re still 
going to be competitive until the 
end. It’s certainly not over.”

MARK CALCAGNO

For the Daily

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

The Michigan men’s soccer team cruised to a 5-1 victory over Oakland on Tuesday at U-M Soccer Stadium.

“When you’re 
a goal scorer, 
confidence 

is king.”

The result of the game hardly 

mattered.

The Michigan men’s soccer 

team (3-9-4) had already sealed 
its spot in the play-in game 
for the Big Ten Tournament. 
No performance against non-
conference foe Oakland would 
change the heart-breaking results 
that have defined this season.

But Michigan coach Chaka 

Daley believes the Wolverines’ 
5-1 victory over the Grizzlies will 
serve as a building block. Possibly 
a building block for a potential 
cinderella run in the Big Ten 
Tournament, or maybe the first 
brick in a late-season offensive 
renaissance. Or perhaps it could 
serve at the start of a foundation 
for the future.

Between 
sophomore 

midfielder 
Robbie 
Mertz, 

sophomore 
forward 
Francis 

Atuahene, 
freshman 
forward 

Jack 
Hallahan 
and 
others, 

Michigan has largely been reliant 
on underclassmen to carry the 
offensive burden. All three have 
logged over 1,000 minutes on the 
season. And while that has led 
to growing pains throughout the 
fall — the Wolverines came into 
the match with just 11 goals in 15 
games — they may just be starting 
to reap the benefits of that young 
talent.

“We believe very much in 

Francis, Jack and Robbie,” Daley 
said. “Those guys are good, young 
players that are the future of 
Michigan soccer.”

Mertz looked dangerous all 

night, calmly weaving through 
defenders with crisp ball control, 
making pinpoint passes out wide 
and offering several chances on 
net. In the 20th minute, he found 
himself on the end of a cross into 
the box and deposited the ball 
through the keeper’s legs to open 

the scoring.

“I think we finally found a 

good spot for Robbie — in there 
centrally as a number 10 — and he 
does a great job for us connecting 
the game.”

Added Mertz, on his new role: 

“I played that all growing up, so I 
was hoping last year, and coming 
into this year, that would be 
something that I would get into in 
the future. They are starting to get 
more comfortable with me there, 
and I certainly like to play there. 
I have a lot of fun playing that 
position.”

Fellow 
underclassman 

Atuahene broke the 1-1 tie early in 
the second half, slotting home the 
goal after a shot deflected off the 
keeper. 

It was the combination of 

Mertz and Atuahene that led to 
the highlight of the night, as Mertz 
found Atuahene on the edge of the 
box. From there, Atuahene did the 
rest, whipping his leg through the 
ball and bending the strike over 
the keeper’s outstretched arms, 
and adding an exclamation point 
to the long-awaited offensive 
outbreak. 

“When you’re a goal-scorer, 

confidence is king,” Daley said. 
“(Francis) scored one, which 
was a little bit of a scrum, but the 
second goal is top-shelf. If we can 
get some confidence and get him 
going, get Jack going, get Robbie 
going, I don’t care who we play, to 
be honest.”

It’s that finishing talent that 

has been sorely lacking from the 
squad throughout the season. But 
the goal offered a glimpse into the 
team’s potential in the coming 
weeks and years. Young attacking 
talent abounds.

As the clocked ticked down 

Tuesday, 
the 
players 
joined 

together on the field, smiling ear 
to ear and exchanging handshakes 
and hugs. Try telling them the 
result didn’t matter.

Michigan gets glimpse 
of the future in victory

OAKLAND
MICHIGAN 

1
5

Two weeks ago, it was Sam 

Piazza 
with 
four 
minutes 

left. Friday night, it was Will 
Lockwood with a minute to go. 
Saturday night, it was Cutler 
Martin taking advantage on the 
power play.

Those 
players 
stepped 
up 

when a battered and struggling 
Michigan hockey team needed 
their 
assistance. 
As 
the 

11th-ranked Wolverines head to 
the East Coast this weekend, they 
are hoping to avoid having the 
need for another lucky goal.

“(These goals are) luck,” said 

Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“We’re not finishing games the 
way we need to finish.

“Getting a good start has been 

part of our history at Michigan. 
We’ve had the lead going into 
most of third periods (this 
season), maybe just about every 
one.”

In their first game of the 

season, the Wolverines blew a 
3-2 lead late in the third period 
and allowed Union to walk away 
with a come-from-behind victory, 
setting the tone for a recent 
stretch in which many games 
have been decided by one goal.

Junior forward Dexter Dancs 

notices the intensity shift in the 
arena atmosphere from the first 
to the third period. For him and 
his fellow Wolverines, though, 
they strive for the same approach 
throughout all three periods. 
Dancs 
will 
only 
occasionally 

look up at the scoreboard during 
games, but when he does, he seems 
to ignore it. He has a game to win, 
a backcheck to induce and a puck 
to control.

“You’re just playing and then 

they’re times when you’re in a 
tight game and it’s 15 minutes left 
in the game, and then you look up, 
and there’s three minutes left in 
the game and it’s still tight,” Dancs 
said.

“If it comes down to crunch 

time with five minutes left in the 
game … then yeah, it starts to get 
intense and really fun.”

For 
freshman 
goaltender 

Hayden Lavigne, who allowed 
a game-tying goal Friday night 

before Lockwood bailed him out 
with a minute left, these late-third-
period scores alter his approach. 
Rather than thinking of the final 
outcome for these few minutes, 
Lavigne assesses the opponent’s 
opportunities shot by shot. And in 
a season in which the Wolverines 
have struggled to clear the puck 
out of their own zone, Lavigne has 
faced his share of chances.

To prepare himself for these 

intense moments, Lavigne has 
developed techniques to relax 
himself in heightened moments 
when a single mishap could lead 
to a loss.

“You have to shake it off right 

away, because then the last three 
minutes of the game become that 
more important,” Lavigne said. 
“Instead of it being a tying goal, 
it becomes a losing goal. My key 
thing is just breathing deep. (It) 
calms down my whole body and 
my mind at the same time.”

Lavigne takes advantage of 

late-game stoppages to speak to 
his blueliners. They speak about 
strategy in their own zone and 
share tips on how to combat the 
opposition’s top scorers. These 

conversations are pivotal, because 
the Wolverines have had to adapt a 
more defensive-minded approach 
after the departure of nearly two-
thirds of its goals to graduation 
or the NHL. Even Berenson 
acknowledged his team lacks 
depth in certain areas this season.

While the goaltending has kept 

Michigan close late in games, 
Berenson believes the Wolverines 
must improve their shots against.

“We’ve been outshot in every 

game, particularly in the third 
period when we’ve had the lead,” 
Berenson said. “And the third 
period was one of our best periods 
last year.”

This weekend, Michigan plays 

Vermont, 
the 
seventh-ranked 

scoring team that averages four 
goals per game. Its most prolific 
period: the third, in which it has 
netted eight goals.

Should the Catamounts score 

a goal in the third period, Dancs 
might even enjoy the intense 
atmosphere, and Lavigne might 
resort to his breathing exercises.

Maybe, the Wolverines will 

need a late goal. They’ve shown 
they can get one.

‘M’ thriving in crunch time

AVI SHOLKOFF
Daily Sports Writer

CLAIRE ABDO/Daily

The Michigan hockey team has found a way to emerge from close games.

Five Things We Learned: Practice

Fans got their first glimpse of 

the 2016-17 Michigan basketball 
squad Tuesday at the team’s 
annual open practice and “selfie” 
night. 

Michigan coach John Beilein 

led several drills with his 16-man 
squad before holding a 20-minute 
5-on-5 
scrimmage. 
With 
the 

Wolverines’ exhibition against 
Armstrong State just over a week 
away, The Daily looks at five things 
we learned from Michigan’s open 
practice.

1. Everyone’s healthy
The Wolverines may be the 

healthiest they’ve been in recent 
years heading into a season. 
Injuries 
have 
hampered 
the 

Wolverines’ preseason progress in 
previous years, including last year 
when senior guard Zak Irvin and 
now-Purdue guard Spike Albrecht 
were both still recovering from off 

season surgeries.

Beilein coached all 16 of his 

players all night, with no one 
apparently limited by injuries. 
Maintaining that level of health 
will be essential as Michigan 
faces a difficult non-conference 
schedule.

2. Wagner a deep threat?
Sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner’s decision to spend his 
summer in Ann Arbor developing 
his game looks like it will pay big 
dividends for the Wolverines. 
Wagner showed off to the Crisler 
faithful 
his 
much-improved 

perimeter shot from the start of 
practice. In Michigan’s first drill, 
a 3-on-2 fast break simulation, 
Wagner made himself open in the 
corner, and drained his first two 
3-point attempts. Wagner carried 
his shooting confidence into the 
scrimmage, where he made a 
couple outside shots as well. 

Expect Wagner to quickly 

surpass the mere 12 3-point 

attempts he took last year and force 
defenders into tough situations if 
he can carry his accuracy into the 
regular season.

3. Freshmen adapting
Freshman 
guard 
Xavier 

Simpson is expected to log big 
minutes for Michigan from the 
start, and he showed he has all 
the ability to live up to those 
expectations. 
Simpson 
wasn’t 

afraid to take on his taller, bulkier 
teammates at the practice, putting 
together a couple of strong drives 
to the hoop in the 20-minute 
scrimmage. 

Also impressive was freshman 

guard Ibi Watson. Like Simpson, 
Watson showed his aggression to 
get to the hoop and put together a 
couple fine plays doing so. Watson 
won’t feature in Beilein’s plans as 
prominently as Simspon, but from 
what he showed on Tuesday, he 
could offer the Wolverines more 
depth coming off the bench.

4. Robinson vs. Flaherty
Beilein kept labeling senior 

guard 
Duncan 
Robinson 
as 

“the best shooter in America” 
throughout Tuesday’s practice.

But he wasn’t even the best in 

Crisler Center that evening.

Robinson faced off with junior 

guard Katelynn Flaherty from the 
women’s team in a 3-point contest 
at the end of practice. Flaherty 
put massive pressure on her male 
counterpart 
after 
going 
first 

and putting on a nearly flawless 
performance, draining 21-of-25 
shots. After a couple early misses 
from the right elbow, Robinson 
came 
back 
and 
sank 
nine 

consecutive 3’s to give him the 
chance to tie Flaherty on the final 
shot. With his teammates ready to 
mob him, Robinson released his 
last shot from the left corner, only 
to watch it bounce off the rim.

5. BOLD PREDICTION: 

Wagner and Mark Donnal will 
start a game together

Wagner seems to have grown 

more than any other player over 
the summer, and the addition of 
a perimeter game will make him 
a much more versatile player. 
If Wagner can find consistency 
in his 3-point shot, he could 
challenge Irvin as an option at 
the ‘4.’

Wednesday, October 26, 2016 / The Statement

There’s something scary about the 

pronoun “I.” When we’re first taught to 
write essays, we’re told to avoid this word 
like the plague. “I” is by turns informal 
and inappropriate, both unworthy of the 
form and too intimate in its implications.

But what’s so wrong about the intimate? 

Is it so dangerous to reveal oneself to the 
reader? Why the hesitancy?

Within these pages, you’ll find seven 

personal essays from staffers throughout 
The Michigan Daily. These range from the 
comical to the revealing to the genuinely 
optimistic — but they are all honest.

In these stories, you’ll find genuine pain, 

happiness and insecurity. Our writers 
will take you on their summer travels 
and to the memory of an impromptu 
comedy-show gone awry. But wherever 
these writers take you, they’ll all bring 
you back to what they’re really trying to 
understand: themselves.

Lessons From the Morgue

B Y M AYA S H A N K A R , D A I LY S TA F F R E P O R T E R
“

You can come closer,” the pathologist said, gesturing 
with his head to the dead body lying on the table in front 
of me while he gripped the bone-saw tightly.

I was in an autopsy, one of the many procedures I signed up 

to shadow in hopes of gaining a better understanding of the 
medical field. I’ve always been determined to be a doctor, an 
aspiration that stems from my desire to make a difference. In 
my 10th grade American Literature class we read a poem, “The 
Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” in which T.S. Eliot writes of 
a protagonist who wonders if he should dare to “disturb the 
universe.” I love this phrase; I think it’s such a beautiful way 
to say “change the world.” For a long time, I thought that to dis-
turb the universe — to transform the world — we would have to 
somehow initiate a great change: eradicate a disease or create 
the next sustainable source of energy. I believed that it was only 
after I became a doctor that I would have my opportunity to 
disturb the universe.

We, as pre-med students, are told to shadow many different 

health care professionals. This makes sense: It exposes us to 
the industry and allows us to make educated decisions about 
the careers we plan to pursue. So, the Spring break of my soph-
omore year of college was spent shadowing as many doctors as 
I could. That was how I found myself in the morgue of a hospi-
tal at 7 a.m. on a cold March morning, being told to step closer 
to the body.

Autopsies are incredibly methodical procedures. The pathol-

ogist starts by examining the patient, cataloguing tattoos and 
scars, before extracting samples of bodily fluid to be tested in 
the lab. The first part of the body to be opened — at least in the 
autopsies I shadowed — is the chest. The doctor observes the 
chest cavity, noting down the position and state of the organs 
inside, before taking out the heart and a lung. He measures and 
weighs the organs before slicing a piece from each and placing 
the rest back into the body. A pathologist never takes a whole 
organ from the patient if they can help it because many people 
believe that they need all their organs to transition to the after-
life. After the chest, he moves on to the pelvic area and then the 
head, carefully measuring, categorizing, cutting and replacing 
all the organs as he moves through the body.

As I stood there, watching this doctor cut into someone else’s 

body, I was reminded of how easy it is to die.

At 20 years old, I sometimes forget that we, as human beings, 

are not invincible. We’re college students; staying up until 5 
a.m. studying, and then waking up in time for our 8 a.m. lec-
tures. We survive on meals of mac and cheese and frozen 
waffles. We walk for 20 minutes in blizzard conditions to get 
to that one class that we can’t miss, lest we lose out on those 
precious attendance points. We spend nights in beds that aren’t 
ours and indulge in drinks we probably shouldn’t drink. We do 
things that might not be good for us but we survive it all. We 
even thrive. It’s easy to take that for granted sometimes, that 
feeling that no matter what we do we’ll be OK.

It was jarring to see proof of the fragility of life laying right 

in front of me.

That morning, witnessing an autopsy, I was struck by both 

the vulnerability and strength of human beings. I was able to 
hold a human heart that had been beating just a few hours ear-
lier. The brain that created the personality and held the memo-
ries of a real person was resting in my hands. It was humbling 
to be able to touch the parts of a person that made them who 
they were, and it was inspiring to see the strength and respect 
with which the doctor performed the procedure. He was an 
artist, cutting and sewing in exact lines. He was a detective, 
studying the clues within his patients. He was a reader, learn-
ing the stories their bodies told even after they were gone.

In the basement of that hospital, standing in a cold, window-

less room where the dead far outnumbered the living, I discov-
ered what it really meant to disturb the universe. Changing the 
world doesn’t require a grand gesture. The patients who were 
lying in front of me had changed the world. Their hearts had 
once beat, their minds had once thought and, even after they 
were gone, their bodies were communicating their stories to 
us. They had lived, and, in doing so, regardless of how small 
of an effect it may have been, they had made their mark; they 
changed their world simply by existing in it. So sitting here, in 
this warm library with lots of windows surrounded by other 
students who are breathing and thinking and feeling, I am 
reminded of the lesson I learned in the morgue — that we are 
alive and we are disturbing the universe.


W

hen I came back to Ann Arbor after a 
spring term spent in lakeside cabins, I 
began to feel awkward in normal conver-

sations. Something that had felt regular before now 
seemed peculiar to me: that people were always ask-
ing me what I was doing, whether I had a job, whether 
I was taking summer classes, what I’m studying and 
whatever else. I had had these kinds of conversations 
countless times before and never thought anything of 
it — it was just normal.

We ask each other these questions for legitimate 

reasons: Details like what you’re studying, where you 
work and what brings you to this school are impor-
tant and can be revelatory in and of themselves about 
certain attributes of a person. We’re at a big school; 
there are a lot of people here and as a result there’s a 
wide range of possibilities as to what someone could 
be doing here.

These conversations about what we’re doing here 

at the University of Michigan are inherently career-
oriented because that’s what most of us are here to 
do — to build skills that will help us make money in 
some way or another. This means our conversations 
are really about commodities and what kinds of com-
modities we’ll be offering to the world economy when 
all is said and done. Pretty dehumanizing, when you 
think of it that way.

On one hand it’s natural: What we spend our time 

doing greatly influences what we talk about. But some-
times we lose sight of how to just be with each other, 
not talking about school, about jobs, about what seven 

different organizations we’re involved in. What may 
seem obvious, but didn’t become clear to me until this 
summer, is that in these conversations people won’t 
tell you what they’re about — their sense of humor, 
their temperament, what makes them tick. During the 
spring semester I spent in the woods, the conversa-
tions I was having with people did bring these things 
out — what I didn’t understand was why.

That spring I was lucky enough to participate in 

the New England Literature Program, which brings 
40 University undergraduates and 13 instructors to 
Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire, to stay in 
cabins, hike and live like transcendentalists — kind 
of. The program allowed me to make some of the best 
friendships of my life, taking courses on literature 
from the region and doing lots and lots of writing. Just 
53 strangers, six weeks and all that writing done in a 
journal that becomes the culmination of your personal 
and academic experience, both of which will become 
inextricably, inexplicably intertwined. We had no 
phones, no computers, no recorded music, no Internet. 
The screens weren’t digital, they only framed images 
between window panes — tall trees against waves of 
the water; when you tapped them only a little dust and 
dirt shook into the air.

It takes a certain kind of person to want to do that 

kind of thing — a certain kind of student who’s had a 
certain kind of experience at the University. Everyone 
who went to NELP was looking for something new, 
and some were looking to escape, for that’s what NELP 
inherently is. The program is heavily influenced by 

transcendentalist ideals, partly because of the setting 
and partly because we read lots of Emerson and Tho-
reau, who escaped an industrializing Boston when he 
wandered into the woods some 200 years ago.

There’s a lot to say about Thoreau: He was a fake; 

he was an artist; he was a privileged white dude who 
wandered into the woods while slaves and ex-slaves 
were trying to gain basic human rights. While all these 
perspectives are crucial, I also like to think of Thore-
au as a rebel. He rejected the mechanization of life and 
the conventional practices of that region’s Christian-
ity, talking about the glory of God in the trees and the 
wind and the water.

A huge part of NELP was being weird, doing some-

thing because you want to, because you believe it’s 
what’s right or is somehow justified. We made paint-
ings, sang sentences, wrote poetry, and had class sit-
ting on logs because it was the only thing we could do.

This — the no screens, the no social media, the lack 

of a University setting and no oppressive classroom 
desk arrangements that alienate us from one anoth-
er — all meant our interactions were stripped down, 
devoid of so much superficiality that was so ubiquitous 
in my life in Ann Arbor. At NELP, we didn’t talk about 
all the clubs we’re in because that wasn’t relevant. We 
were all doing the same thing there, which allowed us 
to skip the surface and just be human with one other. 
We defecated in the woods and next to each other in 
stalls; we swam in our underwear and read Frederick 
Douglass, thought about who we were together and 
carved out parts of our identities.

Back in Ann Arbor after that dream of a 

time, I felt uncomfortable in these talks 

about what we were all doing here 
because those weeks in the woods gave 
me the choice to just be. It’s easy to 
understand that how we spend our time 
influences what conversations we have, 
but we need to see past the surface 
stuff, not forgetting how to just enjoy 
each other’s company. Focus on the 
song that’s playing that you like, on the 
weird hat that guy across the room is 
wearing. Simply being together takes 
courage here at this school where 
grades are important and everyone has 
several online profiles, an image or 
agenda that they’re trying to promote. 
But now simply being — with myself 
and with others — is all I can do any-
more to feel any semblance of being 
grounded.

Tears of a Clown

T

o examine oneself — as one usually does in 
“Personal” “Statements” — a good place to start 
might be one’s online presence. Let’s see. Func-

tionally, my Facebook serves little purpose other than 
to like ClickHole articles. LinkedIn, for me, is a place 
to privately endorse my friends for things like “Tight 
Gas” and “Stretching.” My Twitter is purely a farce: 
I do nothing but retweet from the deepest recesses of 
that strange, esoteric phenomenon known as Weird 
Twitter.

When you (I) put it like that, this examination has 

been incredibly depressing. But I promise I’m normal.

I guess it makes sense, though. This resume of 

online fuckery is of a piece with my general reputation 
as “the funny one.” That’s a nice moniker to have. It 
suggests I may serve some social purpose after all, and 
who doesn’t love to laugh?

To be sure, this is an astoundingly arrogant essay 

to write. I’m working under the precarious assump-
tion that other people think I’m funny, as well as the 
implicit acknowledgement that, yes, the fact that I’m 
writing this means that, on some level, I’d like to think 
I’m funny, too. (It’s better not to mention the third pre-
sumption: that people are still reading this.)

But no matter: Writing to be published on the inter-

net is itself little more than a pathological need for 
external validation, so let’s ignore that shit.

I remember once performing stand-up — I use the 

term lightly — at the tender age of 12. My mother’s col-
lege reunion seemed, to her, to be the perfect venue to 
force her middle-school son to do something he is in no 
way qualified to do. I was too naïve to realize either my 
status as child prop or how utterly embarrassing this 
would be. I got up there and dutifully read off a print-
ed Word document of what some (no one) would call 
“jokes.” This lasted for 10 excruciating minutes. When 
it was all said and done, I should have been convicted 
for war crimes: This was, by far, the worst comedic 
performance the world has ever witnessed.

Years later, I would recognize this moment as the 

one that broke me as a mortal being and has rendered 
me incapable of feeling anything. Thanks, Mom. But 
what pitied laughs I received during that Tight Five, I 
could recognize as some form of appreciation. No one 
was laughing because I had, in that moment, channeled 
a young Richard Pryor. They were laughing because, 
hey, look, there’s a poor little kid trying to tell jokes 
because his mom forced him to, the least we could do 
is make sure he doesn’t cry.

Reader, I cried (eventually).
Here I was at an odd emotional crossroads. This 

supposedly fun thing I’ll never do again had led to an 
unfathomable bout of pre-pubescent crying. I didn’t 
know why then, but I think I might now. From then on, 
the two emotions became, to me, inextricably linked, 
conflated in the worst possible way.

When Robin Williams passed away in 2014, the 

media landscape (that’s a horrible phrase, isn’t it?) 
was inundated with, among other things, variously 
titled riffs on the “Sad Clown” narrative. This trend 
was annoying for many reasons, but chief among them 
was this: that weeks later, the discussion had subsided 

in favor of broader, more accessible eulogies. No one 
wanted to read any more about that knotty buzzword 
“mental health.”

The link between mental illness and comedy is 

a thorny subject to broach, and I make no claims, of 
course, to successfully analyze one or the other. I 
barely understand either. Rather, it’s that disquieting 
relationship between other people’s joy and your own 
sadness, between the optics of your smiling friends 
and your own downturned head, between the surface-
level satisfaction of making someone else laugh and 
the emptiness that comes with wondering why you 
can’t feel that way yourself — this is what I’ve tried to 
figure out for so long.

What does it mean, really, to be “funny?”
What it means to be funny depends on who you’re 

asking. To everyone else, Nabeel’s hilarious. Nabeel’s 
that guy. Nabeel’s always armed with the clever retorts 
and the spur-of-the-moment wit (which, in fact, is 
often less impeccably well-timed and more embarrass-
ingly planned out). I am nothing more than a random 
joke generator. I am not allowed to get serious, or say 
something unironically, lest that permanently off the 
switch on everyone else’s pleasure. I am not a person 
harboring wants and complexities and dissonant emo-
tions, but rather a curious object. I am not a human to 
be wanted, desired, loved. Nabeel’s so funny.

To yourself, you are even more curious an object. You 

are impressed, sometimes, by your own ability to turn 

a phrase, to come up with a response that’s agreeable 
or pleasant or — best-case scenario — funny. You are, 
however, incurably removed. You recognize that, yes, 
other people find this shit funny, but you can’t bring 
yourself to smile. Once the cheap thrills of an earned 
laugh subside, there is nothing left. No, there is some-
thing: It is simply emptiness — and with it, sadness.

Truly, there’s little difference between occupying 

this role of the standard social group and being the 
token minority friend (double whammy!): I am not 
afforded the same agency as everyone else. I know who 
I am: I am by turns snarky and sad, measured by cheer-
fully dark sarcasm and tempered by toxically low self-
confidence, equally steeped in both heavy irony and 
incredible loneliness. But my reputation is “the funny 
one.”

Wow, this got needlessly dramatic, didn’t it? Objec-

tively, there’s nothing quite as satisfying than making 
someone laugh. And complaining about this ability 
— whether it’s imagined or not — might be a bit hyp-
ocritical. After all, what is being funny if not a desper-
ate craving for attention? And now I want, well, more? 
Fuck off, man.

I probably cried that night because I was embar-

rassed. There’s nothing probing or insightful about 
that. But that doesn’t change the fact that I will never 
be without my sense of humor or my inherent sadness. 
There is not one without the other. Funnily enough — I 
don’t know what that means.

Jack and Maria

“

I am a twin” is the perfect fun fact. Some-
thing relatively uncommon that doesn’t 
change. I hear little gasps or whispers 

— like they’re wondering about a parallel me 
that exists, or whether we parade around in 
matching outfits finishing each other’s sen-
tences.

I often get the question “Does your twin go 

here?” to which I could simply respond, “No, 
he doesn’t,” but these days my response is pre-
pared and longer.

“No. Jack has Asperger’s, a high-function-

ing form of autism, and he goes to a small 
school in Massachusetts for kids with learn-
ing and developmental challenges. He takes 
classes at a nearby community college where 
they help him with social skills and job readi-
ness.” Usually the other person is quiet. I 
don’t know what they’re thinking, but maybe 
they envisioned some “Parent Trap” scenario. 
Maybe they imagined us running in similar 
circles of friends or having dual graduations, hitting all the 
big milestones at the same time.

They imagine us both like me, neurotypical 
— a word that 

describes people not under the umbrella of those diagnosed 
with Asperger’s, other autism spectrum disorders or other 
neurologically atypical patterns of thought or behavior. It’s 
hard for me to explain what exactly separates the way Jack 
thinks from the way I do; the only way to explain it would 
be to conjure him up, as everything I say feels reductive or 
vague.

He was diagnosed with Asperger’s when we were tod-

dlers. Though we developed verbally and physically in time 
with each other, my mother noticed a few significant dif-
ferences between us. Jack seemed less connected and he 
engaged in repetitive behaviors that he couldn’t seem to 
control. In 2013 the Asperger’s diagnosis was replaced by 
the umbrella term autism spectrum disorder, but it is still 
the way Jack identifies himself. It’s a diagnosis that includes 
high intelligence, socially awkward behaviors and repeti-
tive or restrictive interests; I’ll be honest in saying that this 
definition doesn’t really mean anything to me. People on the 
spectrum are so different from each other, much of the cri-
teria is fuzzy and Jack both does and doesn’t fit the textbook 
definitions.

I could tell you that Jack has always been a little unlike 

most of the guys my age. He is often quiet and almost always 
compassionate, rarely expressing dislike for anyone. He 
isn’t competitive and has encyclopedic knowledge of cer-
tain music and television facts that he reveals randomly and 
surprisingly. He likes routine, SpongeBob and his iPad. He 
is incredibly sensitive and often mistakes intent to correct 
behavior for a jab at his whole character. Yet he has a grasp 
on sarcasm and forms of nuanced comedy that is thought 
atypical of those on the autism spectrum.

Jack is a man of few words so we don’t talk just to fill 

space. In “The Curious Incident of Dog in the Nighttime,” 
a book both Jack and I love, the protagonist is Christopher, 
a young man on the autism spectrum who dislikes small 
talk. We joke, calling this “doing chatting,” and Jack says 
he doesn’t like it either (I assume most neurotypical people 
also dislike small talk and are just better at hiding it).

Academic professionals told my parents Jack might never 

be able to read, let alone graduate high school or live alone. 
Today he reads well and often; however, reading compre-
hension and articulating his thoughts about a text through 
verbal or written language is incredibly challenging. He 
has navigated the complex New York subway system for 
six years as if with an internal GPS, committed his time 
regularly helping kids with Down syndrome and serving at 
a fast-paced soup kitchen in Lower Manhattan. He’s lived 
away from home for over a year. Aside from an occasional 
harsh tone or F-bomb to an annoying sister, I can’t remem-
ber a time when he was unkind.

Though Jack loves to jokingly remind me that he was 

born six minutes earlier and is therefore the oldest in our 
family, questions of birth order are complex. Measuring 
age by rotations around the sun doesn’t really work for us. 
When I was the first to leave for college, I knew that in a 
functional way, I was the singular oldest child.

It was never a question whether I would go to college, 

but rather which competitive and well-respected college I 
would choose. I have always had standards — for friends, 
grades, writing, morality, all of it — to a maybe impossible 
level. I overschedule, overextend and work quickly. Despite 
normal bouts of laziness or procrastination, I admit reluc-
tantly that I hardly cut myself slack. What I mean to say 
is Jack and I are close, but we exist in seemingly different 
worlds.

Since preschool he had always been in a smaller class 

than me, cloistered away. He often practiced echolalia, a 
pretty word for repeating common phrases to himself, a 
calming mechanism, unsavory to the public. He would 
ask people how many doors their houses had and how old 
they were, something that was endearing at age 4 but soon 
became inappropriate. In elementary school, when kids 
would ask me why he was the way he was or why we didn’t 
go to the same school, I would turn red, finding myself at a 
loss for words. I remember being 5 or 6, when Jack and I sat 
glued to “Arthur” or “SpongeBob SquarePants.” He would 
cover his ears during the theme songs but be entranced by 
the cartoons the whole time. For a long time, he insisted on 
only wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts during the 

summer.

Mental health professionals think people with 

autism have heightened senses. Some compare it to 
being inside a fun house. This explained some of the 
clothing particularity and why he would cover his 
ears, and even maybe the perfect pitch in his singing 
voice that brought people to tears when they heard 
Jack singing Sinatra’s “Fly me to the Moon” on our 
answering machine in the early 2000s. Maybe it 
explains his desire to spend time alone. It is thought 
that kids like Jack go somewhere else, to another 
headspace, when the sensory overload gets takes 
over.

I’ve had trouble with this idea of “somewhere else,” 

even as a self-proclaimed daydreamer and a cultiva-
tor of an imaginative life. A stubborn part of me ques-
tions this other world despite an otherwise open 
mind. I think I buy into the twin clichés sometimes, 
wanting our minds to be in perfect sync with each 
other, a cosmic pairing no one else would understand.

In the space of Jack’s certain quietness in a loud 

and chaotic world, I sometimes notice things about him that 
I only know how to explain by the fact that we are twins. 
Though he never expressly said anything to me about it, I 
urged my parents to give Jack more independence when we 
were teenagers because I had instincts that he was ready. 
I don’t mean to speak for my brother or assume access to 
his every thought, but I know he has grown my capacity for 
empathy and a critical eye toward a world that often dis-
counts an “unconventional” mind.

More than wishing that my brother were different, I am 

stubborn in wishing that the world were, that I didn’t have 
to think of an ableist slur or a punch hurled at Jack when he 
gets flustered or overwhelmed. I wish such a narrow-mind-
ed achievement model didn’t loom over us both, dispropor-
tionately affecting people like Jack who learn and develop 
in ways deemed abnormal or unconventional.

I feel a twinge of guilt when I think of a confused 9-year-

old me — her quietness about Jack. I think of how I wish I 
could say to her, “Your twin brother has a boundless bravery 
and compassion that I wish you could understand.” I think 
maybe that shame left somewhere around seventh grade, 
when I tried to comfort Jack one night when he was dis-
traught over being bullied at school, a systematic problem 
that the school had been neglecting. I knew that my quiet 
brother was much wiser inside than he was able to let on 
and had a capacity for astronomical feeling.

Jack proves daily that our minds are mysterious, varied 

and without need to show themselves ostentatiously. He 
reminds me to be goofy and patient and often forces our 
family to lighten up when the mood gets heavy. He is incred-
ibly affectionate and remembers the silliest moments of our 
childhood that will always make me smile, half because of 
what they are and half because it is Jack telling them in his 
way. I think we’ve come to know that our developmental 
milestones look different, and that it’s OK because it has to 
be and it should be.

I wish to embrace the fun-fact twin answer so fully, in 

all of its complexity and nuance, something only made pos-
sible by pulling my brother into the circle with me — so that 
everyone in the room can feel how lucky I am to have him 
as my other half.

B

y way of introduction, I feel obligated to inform 
you, the reader, that I’m not really quite sure how 
to go about writing this — the knowledge of which 

might mean, conversely, that in some way you’ll be more 
sure of how to go about reading it. The first unforeseen 
(though obviously easily foreseeable) challenge is that I 
wasn’t exactly just sitting around looking for things to do. 
In fact, it took me about six weeks to find a few spare 
hours in which to work, which led to the production of 
this essay’s first draft in a spurt of frenetic, caffeine-
fueled typing in a German cafe, where I vainly hoped that 
with my few days respite before I went on the road again 
I might be able to sputter out a few thousand words of 
genuine, semi-coherent writing that at least someone 
might deem worth reading. Not to mention that I feel 
as if this whole thing should probably be more than a 
catalogue or chronology, i.e., should have some sort of 
overarching thesis, raison d’être or “point,” the substance 
of which I’m really hoping I’ll discover as I go along. The 
second and only slightly less obvious difficulty is found 
in the necessity of presenting my trip as the intensely 
individual experience it was without simultaneously 
lapsing into excessive solipsism. Somehow, I need to 
be both authentic to my emotional memory and engage 
you in experiences which are not your own — all while 
scrupulously avoiding the irksome “look-at-all-the-cool-
things-I’m-doing” tone which would drive you to rapidly 
abandon reading the remainder. A regular Scylla and 
Charybdis, as you can see.

For those of you still here, I promise I’ll get to the 

actual point of the piece relatively soon. But first, I 
think it would be fruitful to talk a bit about myself in a 
more specific way. After all, most narratives featuring 
a nameless or nondescript protagonist about whom we 
know nothing tend to lead to a state of indifference or 
sink us into a mental sopor, with the notable exception 
of nameless characters to whom horrible things happen, 
who — at least for me — tend to induce a general sense 
of extrapolated existential dread. And in this context, 
it’s probably best to think of me, the author, as a mostly-
non-fictional character. Anyway, if you check the top 
of the page, you’ll notice that my name is Dayton Hare. 
I am a sophomore at the University of Michigan, where 
I’m a music composition major (and will soon add a 
second degree in English). With that in mind, more than 
anything else I am a composer, and I like (rather vainly, 
I suppose) to think of myself as young artist/intellectual. 
I love books (the type you can hold), history, poetry and 
modernist literature. I love the electric charge of the air 
before rain, and the smell of soil after. I like long walks on 
the beach as much as anyone, though I find the inevitable 
accumulation of sand on one’s feet to be incredibly 
irritating.

My flight was on 19 June, from Atlanta. My fellow 

traveler was my younger sister Fiona, who was traveling 
to Europe to study Shakespearean acting in London, just 
as I was going to study music and composition in Paris. 
During a layover in Washington D.C., we coincidentally 
ran into a mutual friend of ours from high school, 
who was travelling to Morocco to study Arabic. Small 
world, really. We boarded the plane in late evening, and 
somewhere over the North Atlantic I watched the warm 
heat of a parabolic dawn consume the thousands of stars 
burning coldly above us.

Our first sight of Europe was the deep green coast of 

Ireland as we descended toward Dublin (it turns out, 
after all, that the term “Emerald Isle” is not a misnomer). 
The first indication that we weren’t in America anymore 
came in the form of the airport signs, which were written 
first in Irish and second in English. The Irish capital itself 
was cool and grey, and people hurried about incessantly. 
My sister and I joined them, eager to see as much of the 
city as possible before we had to fly to Rome in a couple 
of days. Strolling through the city, we quickly fell into 
the local habit of jaywalking recklessly. I found myself 
casually wondering if dashing across the road involved 
the same sort of collective rebellion of spirit as led to 
the Irish War of Independence of 1919 (though I quickly 
dismissed this as a mind-boggling oversimplification and 
an idea that was frankly rather stupid). Later in the day, 
we visited the Garden of Remembrance, constructed as a 
memorial to “all those who gave their lives in the cause of 
Irish Freedom.”

To me Dublin has always been the city of Joyce, and 

this wasn’t changed by visiting it. We came across a statue 
of the author on the street, and I posed dramatically with 
him as my sister snapped a photo. I love Joyce, and I’ve 
always felt a certain empathetic connection to him, as if 
we were similar in some way (a bit conceited, I know). 
Perhaps it’s just the fact that we were both youths of 
artistic temperament growing up in places we felt to be 
culturally oppressive in some way (in his case, Ireland; in 
mine, the American South). I don’t really know why, but 
I’m ceaselessly fascinated with him. Part of the reason for 
these sorts of journeys always seems to be that of self-
discovery, and I suppose that this Joycean encounter 
contributes to that as much as anything. It’s not as if I 
experienced some sort of dramatic artistic or personal 

revelation à la Beckett-in-mother’s-bedroom, but walking 
in the same place as an artist I’ve long admired walked, 
inhabiting the same space he inhabited, separated only by 
temporality, made that particular part of my identity feel 
more connected or “real.” Or perhaps that’s all nonsense. 
I’ve always considered the “self” to be relatively 
unknowable, but my compulsive need to acquire concrete 
knowledge always drives me to try to make sense out 
of these sorts of things, even when I can cognitively 
acknowledge that it’s probably a waste of time.

After seeing Joyce’s statue, we visited the Dublin 

Writers Museum, which was next door to a gallery of 
Irish art. Walking through the museum after a peek at the 
gallery, we saw first editions and manuscripts and letters 
— the lot. Before leaving the city, we strolled across the 
grounds of Trinity College, gazed at the illuminated 
pages of the Book of Kells, breathed in the paper-laden 
aroma of Trinity’s library, became lost no fewer than four 
times and unexpectedly consumed the spiciest Thai food 
either of us had ever encountered. By the evening of the 
second day, we were on a plane bound for a very different 
city, one that — like Dublin — was allegedly founded by a 
ship-borne people, but has a history nearly two millennia 
longer and a cultural footprint felt across continents.

Before we left for Rome, we took a final walk through 

the city. We strolled around St. Stephen’s Green, past St. 
Patrick’s Cathedral (the Irish are remarkably Catholic, 
aren’t they?), down through the Temple Bar district and 
across the river. As we passed over a bridge, I looked 
down at the waters of the River Liffey. The flowing mass 
was too active to form a mirror — I could see nothing of 
myself. I thought it a pity. What a great metaphor for self-
reflection that would have made.

Dancing Like Nobody’s Watching

A

nyone who knows me well enough knows that I love to dance, 
whether at a party or even in the most mundane setting.

For the record, I’ve never taken a dance class in my life — 

nor have I ever been interested in being a professional dancer. And 
yet it’s a quality about myself that most people note immediately once 
I start moving and grooving. Anything with pounding bass and wob-
bly synths, a pop or hip hop number, I can dance to. I’m all for up-
tempo songs, and my favorites include the typical Top 40 bangers: 
Outkast’s “Hey Ya!,” Usher’s “Yeah!” and Mark Ronson’s “Uptown 
Funk,” to name a few.

I’d like to think that my dancing skills stem from my maternal 

grandparents, who were known to always be the first and last ones on 
the dance floor at any occasion. But the truth is that my passion for 
dancing derives from trying to escape social awkwardness growing 
up as a shy, sensitive and mostly introverted kid. It was my cousin 
Alex’s bar mitzvah party in 2006 that changed the trajectory of all 
that, transforming me from a restless, socially inept kid with an infe-
riority complex into a more self-assured young adult. 

The night of the bar mitzvah party, I recall the evening starting off 

on a bad note. Entering the event, I immediately felt out of place. I 
was dressed in a black shirt too big for my torso, gray slacks that felt 
too long and leather shoes that seemed too fancy for the party. There 
were a variety of activities, including a pop-culture trivia tournament 
that I thought I’d try out. After waiting a while, it was my turn, my 
opportunity to stand out among the crowd. Up against four other par-
tygoers, I did my best to answer the question as soon as it was asked. 
But alas, I missed my moment: My cousin Austin buzzed his button 
before me and gave the wrong answer. That was that, and my turn 
was over. My 15 seconds of spotlight faded and I wallowed back to my 
seat, feeling defeated and disappointed.

During the rest of the evening, I sulked outside the main ballroom, 

where all the customary bar mitzvah party traditions were taking 
place. I missed the Hava Nagilah, the corny candle-lighting ceremo-
nies, the sentimental speeches. But I didn’t even care. Still upset 
about the trivia tournament, I was fuming with angry silence, staring 
down at the ground and sitting in a rigid, crisscross-applesauce posi-
tion. It wasn’t until hours later that I finally decided to join the party, 
where I sat at a table by myself in the midst of it all. To this day, I 
have immense gratitude to one of the female, referee-jersey-wearing 
entertainers, who approached 9-year-old me, sitting by my lonesome, 
and asked if I’d like to dance.

Stubbornly, I declined her offer at first. But as the night dragged 

on and the music got funkier, I thought, “What the hell? I’m 9 years 
old. I’ve got nothing to lose.” (I didn’t actually think that, but I assume 
that’s how I felt in the moment). And thus, Sam Rosenberg the Danc-
er was born.

As my legs wobbled and my hips gyrated to the thumping beats 

blasting from the speakers, I could feel the adrenaline pumping 
through my pre-teen veins. I got such a rush, simply from taking the 
risk of dancing along to whatever mid-2000s pop hit roared over the 
speakers. The entertainers would pass out glow sticks, goofy glasses 
and silly hats to every kid and I made sure to wear and flaunt each and 
every item I could get my hands on. My cynicism of the night changed 
quickly into optimism. I no longer felt insecure about whether people 
would care about what I did; I liked this new side of myself and want-
ed to continue to explore this aspect of my personality.

As I entered middle school, dancing gave me a space to express 

myself, even at my most self-conscious. I’d often be the only boy at 
a bar mitzvah party who was dancing to the rhythm of the music, 
instead of just jumping up and down in a circle like the rest of my 
male peers. Sometimes, I would get strange looks and when I did, I 
would immediately notice and stop dancing. But other times, people 
would encourage it and even ask me to give them some tips on dance 
moves. I recall a specific moment at my middle school social in sixth 
grade when I got the attention of an attractive seventh grader after I 

rapidly moved my arms in a wave-like formation. It was stupid and 
weird, but for some reason, people liked it and that’s all that mattered 
to me.

High school came and I continued to glide seamlessly into the 

party scene, shaking my shoulders, inventing spontaneous dance 
moves and letting the beat carry me at every homecoming, prom and 
function I attended. College has been an even better experience 
for me, with almost every party offering a comfortable 
capacity for me to dance.

Personally, dancing has always been a way 

for me to deal with social anxiety and to 
boost my self-confidence. But I also 
consider dancing to be a beautiful 
expression of human behavior. 
We don’t often think about 
how ubiquitous dancing can 
be and how fun it is to just 
let loose and groove with 
your friends and family 
and even strangers. And 
the best dancing is the 
one where you don’t care 
if you look stupid. What-
ever the song, you can 
shimmy, shake, twerk, 
bounce, whip, nae nae 
and milly rock without 
being judged. 

Despite what most 

of my friends say, I 
don’t consider myself 
an exceptional danc-
er. I don’t know how 
to salsa, box step or 
moonwalk. I can’t 
do the Worm or 
the Running Man. 
I’m not trained 
to perform or do 
dance-offs 
like 

the dancers from 
“Step Up,” “You 
Got 
Served” 

and “Stomp the 
Yard.” 
When 

people spread 
out to make a 
circle at par-
ties or music 
festivals, 
I’m 

always hesitant 
to step in, think-
ing that my brain 
would freeze in 
the moment and 
I’d do the same dance 
move over and over like 
a broken record.

Nevertheless, 
it’s 
always 

comforting to know how much confi-
dence dancing has given me over the years. I may still feel somewhat 
overwhelmed whenever the spotlight is cast on me, but when the 
opportunity comes, I do my best to not miss it, and I just dance like 
nobody’s watching.

Still Making a Statement 

B Y T O M H AY D E N , P U B L I S H E D O C T O B E R 2 5 , 2 0 1 2

F

ew Ann Arbor residents know that The Statement, 
the Daily’s weekly news magazine, is named in 
memory of the Port Huron Statement, drafted by 

myself as the founding document of Students for a Dem-
ocratic Society 50 years ago.

This week, the University will host a conference to 

explore the legacy of what many Ann Arbor students 
birthed half a century ago.

The vision of the Port Huron Statement lives on. The 

first principle of last year’s Occupy Wall Street move-
ment was a call for participatory democracy, the guiding 
concept of the Port Huron Statement.

From SDS to Occupy, students have led movements 

demanding a voice. We believed in not just an electoral 
democracy, but also in direct participation of students 
in their remote-controlled universities, of employees in 
workplace decisions, of consumers in the marketplace, 
of neighborhoods in development decisions, family 
equality in place of Father Knows Best and online, open 
source participation in a world dominated by computer-
ized systems of power.

The Port Huron Statement represented the dawn of 

an era, which began with the student sit-in movement 
and the Beat Generation, and didn’t end until 1975, with 
the fall of Richard Nixon and Saigon.

Students in Ann Arbor played a leading role in defin-

ing this era. One year after graduating from the Uni-
versity, where I edited The Michigan Daily, I drafted 
the 25,000 word Port Huron Statement that served as a 
manifesto for “participatory democracy,” which initial-
ly came to us from a University faculty adviser, Arnold 
Kaufman. The Students for a Democratic Society found-
er, Al Haber, fostered a hotbed of debate between 1961 
and 1963, before our vision came to fruition in Berke-
ley’s Free Speech Movement and the first national Viet-
nam teach-ins organized at the University.

Ann Arbor was also a central site of the New Fron-

tier. University students, myself included, approached 
Sen. John F. Kennedy in October 1960 to request that 
he endorse international service as an alternative to the 
military draft. He read our letter and, over worries from 
his advisers, proposed the Peace Corps on the steps of 
the Michigan Union that night.

As an example of what might have been, President 

Lyndon Johnson proposed a “Great Society ... where 
men are more concerned with the quality of their goals 
than the quantity of their goods,” at a 1964 University 
commencement address. The author of LBJ’s speech, 
Richard Goodwin, credited the Port Huron Statement 
as being a major influence. Goodwin later wrote a note 
“to Tom Hayden, who ... without knowing it inspired 
the Great Society,” referring to participatory democracy 
and the administration’s anti-poverty programs.

JFK’s assassination staggered us, but his signing of 

the nuclear test ban treaty before his death made us 
hope for a thaw in the Cold War arms race, which almost 

obliterated millions during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

I left graduate school at the University in summer 1964 

to begin community organizing in the slums of Newark, 
N.J. As a member of about 200 SDS activists who planned 
to devote our lives to a nationwide equivalent of the Mis-
sissippi Summer Project, I believed that “an interracial 
movement of the poor” could empower a new constitu-
ency demanding jobs and economic equality.

The United Auto Workers, which was led by Walter 

Reuther, gave us the Port Huron Conference Center 
courtesy of a top officer, “Millie” Jeffrey, whose daugh-
ter was an SDS leader at the University. The UAW also 
donated funds to the SDS community organizing proj-
ects, as well as major resources for Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr., the United Farm Workers and the early activ-
ists of what became the National Organization for 
Women. In that brief period, our hoped-for coalition 
seemed to be coming together.

The final sentence of the Statement warned, howev-

er, that “If we appear to seek the unattainable, let it be 
known that we do so to avoid the unimaginable.” The 
unimaginable was about to happen.

The Cold War was the mountain we could not climb. 

Much like today’s War on Terrorism – the official Cold 
War assumption was that nothing could be spared to 
protect Americans from conspiratorial threats. The par-
anoid Cold War assumption was that the Soviet Union 
now was plotting to take over the world. Small countries 
like Vietnam were seen as pawns in this global plot. 
Peace and civil rights groups at home, even leaders like 
Dr. King, were surveilled as The Enemy Within.

The Port Huron Statement challenged all that, pro-

posing nuclear de-escalation and disarmament. We did 
this not because we were “pro-Communist” but because 
we knew that militarized and unbalanced anti-Commu-
nism would divert America’s attention away from our 
needs at home.

In 1961, the eminent professor Robert Angell told me 

soothingly over breakfast that I could trust Kennedy’s 
new defense secretary, Robert McNamara – he called 
him Bob – because he was “one of us,” a liberal intellec-
tual who lived just off Geddes Avenue and drove into his 
Ford Motor office in Detroit every day. On June 9, just 
as the Port Huron convention was opening, McNamara 
gave a speech in Ann Arbor defending what he called 
a “centrally-controlled campaign against all of the ene-
my’s vital nuclear capabilities” in the event of a crisis. 
It foreshadowed our greatest fears, which almost came 
true in the Cuban Missile Crisis just months later.

Tragically, the Cold War led liberal intellectuals like 

McNamara, along with our key allies in the UAW, into 
the bloody quagmire of Vietnam. McNamara channeled 
his personal brilliance into propaganda when he assert-
ed in August 1964 that the bombing of North Vietnam 
was due to “naked aggression” by Hanoi, a claim he pri-
vately knew to be false. When LBJ pledged “no wider 

war,” only two Democratic senators opposed the Gulf of 
Tonkin war authorization. After promising not to send 
American ground troops during his presidential cam-
paign, there were 184,000 Americans deployed to Viet-
nam by late 1965.

Nothing turned out as I once imagined. There was one 

constant: the tides of movements and counter-move-
ments kept churning. Movements based on participatory 
democracy eventually gained some meaningful reforms: 
voting rights for southern black people and 18-year 
olds, the fall of two presidents, amnesty for 50,000 war 
resisters in Canada, the Freedom of Information Act, 
democratic reforms of the presidential primary systems, 
collective bargaining rights for public employees and 
farmworkers, the Roe v. Wade decision, the Clean Air, 
Clean Water, and Endangered Species acts, a long list of 
reforms gained in less than a decade.

Social change did occur, precious inch by bloody 

inch, becoming sacred ground that had to be protected, 
decade after decade, from both reaction and oblivion.

Underlying all of this tumultuous history lay the 

rocky river of participatory democracy – “the river of 
my people” – which kept flowing.

Now, to paraphrase Port Huron, we are the elders of 

this generation looking uncomfortably to the world we 
leave behind as inheritance. The reforms we achieved 
are under constant assault from the right and stagnating 
with the passage of time.

We are in the process of a new beginning, signaled by 

the deep American discontent with the wars in Afghani-
stan and Iraq, the threat of more wars to come and the 
immense diversion of trillions of tax dollars from our 
needs at home for health care and affordable education. 
Like the ‘60s, another imperial presidency is on the rise, 
unleashing covert military operations in multiple coun-
tries without serious congressional oversight or civic 
awareness. Like the ‘60s, the long war leaves greater 
economic inequality and environmental depletion in its 
wake.

Perhaps most disturbing of all, “The wealthiest 1 per-

cent of Americans own more than 80 percent of all per-
sonal shares of stock,” just as we wrote at Port Huron. 
That unchanged economic inequality threatens political 
democracy at the core.

What can one say in the face of these terrible chal-

lenges, so reminiscent of yesteryear? Perhaps, just per-
haps, the ripples of today’s student protest movements 
foreshadow a coming revolt of those who will not settle. 
Or perhaps today’s generation will accommodate and 
live the rest of their lives in a defensive crouch. Who can 
be sure? We know that movements begin unexpectedly. 
Rebellion begins anew, like a first flower forcing win-
ter’s passing, as it happened in Ann Arbor in that spring-
time long ago. The Port Huron Statement is a message 
sent in a bottle, and participatory democracy a tradition 
for future rebels to drink from.

Editor’s note: Two days ago, the University of Michigan community lost one of its most influential members, Tom Hayden, who died at 76 in 

his California home. A former editor in chief of The Michigan Daily, Hayden began his career as a political activist as a University student, and 

soon after his graduation founded the Students for a Democratic Society, one of the most important groups in the New Left movement. More 
than 50 years ago, while jailed in Georgia after participating in the Freedom Rider protests, he wrote the Port Huron Statement, a manifesto 

for left-wing student protests that shaped a nascent generation of activism. He was at the vanguard of the civil rights and anti-war movements 

of the ‘60s and ‘70s, leading protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. He leaves a legacy of fervent activism for participatory 

democracy and a commitment to galvanizing student political engagement.

The Statement is named in part after Hayden’s manifesto. To honor his life and work, we are reprinting a piece he submitted to The 

Statement in 2012, written for the 50th year anniversary of the Port Huron Statement. A half-century couldn’t quell his indefatigable belief in 

the power of the people to enact change.
