tip-off

Institutional racism 
must be acknowledged

By THE MICHIGAN DAILY

Editorial Board

The University community is no 

stranger to protests in recent years with 
several student groups calling for the 
administration to improve race relations 
and increase diversity on campus. 
Therefore, the events of this past week 
at the University of Missouri should be 
of no surprise to anyone paying attention 
to the realities that Black students face 
each and every day on college campuses 
across the nation. But therein lies the 
problem: Not enough people are paying 
attention. Too many deny the existence 
of institutional racism.

That must change now.
The School of Social Work People of 

Color Collective led a demonstration on 
the Diag Wednesday evening to stand 
in solidarity with the Black community 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Missouri. 

Hundreds of University community 
members gathered to share personal 
experiences and show their support. 
The demonstration comes after months 
of racial tension on Missouri’s campus, 
which culminated in the resignation 
of the Missouri system’s president, 
Timothy Wolfe, on Nov. 9.

A prominent student activist group at 

Mizzou, Concerned Student 1950 — which 
refers to the first year Black students 
were admitted to the university — led an 
aggressive push for Wolfe’s resignation 
after it became evident he was incapable 
of dealing with racism on campus. The 
group also called for a formal apology 
from Wolfe along with eight other 
demands of the administration. These 
efforts echo similar actions taken by the 
University of Michigan’s Black Student 
Union, which led a protest in January 
2014 that garnered national attention 
about issues of race on college campuses.

In the cases of both Missouri and 

Michigan, student groups criticized 
the 
inaction 
of 
their 
respective 

university administrators and called 
for reform to increase education about 
race in course curricula, enrollment 
of ethnic minorities and accessibility 
to safe spaces on campuses, such as 
multicultural 
centers. 
There’s 
no 

denying the differences in the cultural 
climates at the University of Missouri 
and on our campus. But the overarching 
commonalities 
in 
these 
demands 

illustrate the urgent need to address 
the institutional racism ever-present 
in our nation that takes shape in many 
forms: lack of minority representation 
and inclusivity on college campuses, 
discriminatory criminal justice policy 
and voter registration laws, police 
brutality and so much more.

This week, our University hosted the 

Diversity Summit to collect opinions 
on how to devise a campus-wide plan 
to improve inclusion and diversity on 
campus. These efforts — along with those 
aimed at increasing minority enrollment, 
expanding education about race in 
curricula and improving the Trotter 
Multicultural Center — demonstrate a 
legitimate attempt to stimulate a broad 
conversation about race on campus and 
create tangible change. But there’s a 
long, long way to go. For starters, the 
entire campus community must listen 
to, sympathize with and learn about the 
very real and urgent struggles that Black 
students — and all students of color — face 
in 2015. In other words, wake up and pay 
attention.

Detroit Police 

assistant chief to 
assume role in early 
2016, pending vote

By SHOHAM GEVA

Daily News Editor

There’s a new chief in town.
The city of Ann Arbor 

announced 
Thursday 
that 

James White, an assistant 
police chief with the Detroit 
Police Department, has been 
appointed the new Ann Arbor 
Police Chief. The selection 
pends approval by the Ann 
Arbor City Council, which will 
vote on the recommendation 
at their meeting Monday.

White will replace John 

Seto, current chief of the Ann 
Arbor Police Department, who 
announced his retirement in 
May. Seto was appointed chief 
of police in 2012, and served 
for 25 years with AAPD. He 

has since accepted a job with 
the University as the director 
of Housing Security. 

City Administrator Steve 

Powers, who is responsible for 
making the recommendation, 
wrote in a press release that 
White’s skill set prepared him 
well for the job.

“I’m 
confident 
that 

James’ broad management 
experience and abilities will 
be an asset to the Ann Arbor 
Police Department, which has 
a well-earned reputation for 
excellence,” he wrote. “James 
has a keen understanding of 
law enforcement challenges 
and opportunities and I’m 
confident he will serve the 
Ann Arbor community well.”

If 
approved 
as 
chief, 

White will have to face the 
ongoing 
controversy 
over 

the fatal shooting of Ann 
Arbor resident Aura Rosser a 
year ago by an AAPD officer. 
The shooting has prompted 
multiple protests in the city,

However, 
a

on staff and faculty.

The

largely 

centered 
around 
a

Darlene Nichols, a committee

found that about 75 percent 
of the staff surveyed felt good 
about working at the University.

Hundreds attend 
event hosted by 

Students for Choice

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

Amid an ongoing national 

debate over abortion rights and 
Planned 
Parenthood, 
about 

300 students gathered in the 

Michigan Union on Thursday 
night for the third annual 
Abortion Speak Out.

The event, which invited 

people to share their personal 
experiences with abortion, was 
hosted in collaboration with 
the 1 in 3 Campaign, a national 
group that aims to make 
abortion a less taboo topic.

“I thought it was very 

powerful and I’m so grateful 
that all of these people were 

so brave and able to share their 
stories,” said LSA junior Kelsey 
Almony, a member of Students 
for Choice. “And I hope that 
other spaces can be created like 
this for other people to share 
their stories.”

During the speak out, only 

individuals who had an abortion 
were permitted to share, and 
organizers placed restrictions 
on recording or social media 

Basement Arts 
stages Martin 
McDonnaugh’s 
acclaimed play

By GRACE HAMILTON

Daily Arts Writer

“The 
Pillowman” 
is 
a 

complex play about violence, 
politics and the power of art. 
Confidently confronting issues 
such as child 
abuse 
and 

fratricide, the 
work is a feat 
for both the 
playwright 
and 
his 

audiences. 
It is perhaps 
even more of 
a 
challenge 

for the actors 
who must plumb the depths 
for 
their 
representation, 

particularly when those actors 
work under the constraints of 
limited resources and limited 
time. 

“Come and expect to laugh. 

And then leave shaken to your 
core,” School of Music, Theatre 

& Dance senior and director 
Jacob Sam Rich said of “The 
Pillowman.”

Comedies can’t get any 

darker than this. 

Basement Arts, a student-

run 
theater 
organization 

that 
has 
provided 
free 

entertainment 
to 
the 

University for over 20 years, 
has never shied away from 
challenges such as these. 
In fact, the group actively 
seeks 
cutting-edge 
work 

that continues to push the 
boundaries of both its own 
previous 
productions 
and 

the rest of the University’s 
theater world. Most audiences 
can’t get enough of it; some of 
their notable productions like 
“A Very Potter Musical” and 
“Me and My Dick” have even 
reached national success.

This Saturday, Basement 

Arts is putting on its production 
of Irish playwright Martin 
McDonagh’s “The Pillowman” 
with a cast of four. After its 
debut in 2003, the play has 
been produced on Broadway 
and London’s West End and 
earned the 2004 Oliver Award 
for Best New Play.

The play is set in an 

Dark, challenging 
meta-comedy in

Model to help patients at risk 
for stroke select the best drug

Coursera co-founder talks 
impact of open online courses

University research 
aims to determine 
most cost-effective 

treatments

By JALAL TALEB

For the Daily

University researchers have 

developed a new model to help 
individuals at risk of stroke select 
the best preventative drug — based 
in part on cost effectiveness.

The model, co-authored by Dr. 

Geoff Barnes, a clinical lecturer 
of cardiovascular medicine and 
vascular medicine, and Deborah 
Levine, an associate professor 
of internal medicine, focused on 
drugs for one type of irregular 
heartbeat — nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation — which can lead to 
strokes.

This irregular heartbeat hap-

pens when disruptive electrical 
activity triggers unusual contrac-

tions of the heart’s main pumping 
chambers, called the ventricles. 
When the ventricles are triggered, 
the heart doesn’t pump blood 
through the body as efficiently, 
which can cause clotting. These 
clots, in turn, make their way to 
vessels in the brain, potentially 
forming blockages that lead to 
strokes.

Currently, two classes of drugs 

are available to treat the condi-
tion — a cheaper anticoagulant 
known as a warfarin, which has 
been around for decades, and a 
new, more expensive line known 
as dabigatran.

Barnes said the two treatment 

options have left many Americans 
with irregular heartbeats facing a 
difficult economic choice.

Beyond the drugs themselves, 

he noted the issue has also been 
challenging because prescription 
prices vary depending on health 
care coverage. Barnes said this 
makes a cost-conscious model 
especially important. Their model 
is unique, he said, because it also 

considers the patient’s perspective 
on cost, as opposed to prior studies 
that only considered cost from a 
societal or insurance perspective.

“The importance of this deci-

sion comes from a patient’s per-
spective, as we discuss with them 
the affordability of these decisions 
based on their personal situa-
tions,” he said.

Along with patient perspective, 

the model draws on several other 
factors — how well the drugs pre-
vent stroke, the possibilities of side 
effects and the cost of the pills — to 
determine the advantage and dis-
advantages of each.

Overall, Barnes and Levine said 

the team found that the prescrip-
tion drug coverage a patient has 
matters most in terms of cost and 
benefits. Those without cover-
age, according to the study, could 
pay thousands of dollars for more 
effective drugs such as dabigatran, 
which may not always be worth-
while.

Barnes said many patients 

in that category are those who 
receive coverage through Medi-
care Part D. Under Medicare Part 
D, throughout much of the year, 
patients’ prescription costs are 
covered; however, at a set point, 
patients’ prescription coverage is 
exhausted and they must pay out 
of pocket.

“For the first part of the year, 

our patients have good coverage,” 
Barnes said. “By the late fall, when 
faced with the ‘donut hole,’ many 
patients will pay thousands of 
dollars per pill … unfortunately, 
patients will try to stretch out 
their prescriptions, not taking 
them every day, skipping doses.”

However, the study found that 

patients with prescription drug 
coverage, including Medicare Part 
D, had overall costs savings when 
choosing the more expensive dabi-
gatran over warfarin.

This was primarily because of 

the effectiveness both drugs have 
on stroke, and also because they 
eliminated the need for more fre-
quent blood draws and visits to the 
clinic that users of warfarin some-
times require.

However, 
Levine

Daphne Koller, president and co-founder of Coursera, speaks about the website as a part of the Academic Innovation at 
Michigan series at the Michigan League on Thursday.

University faculty 

have taught 22 
classes on the 

platform

By BECCA SOLBERG

For the Daily

Technology 
continues 
to 

transform learning, both outside 
and inside the classroom, Cours-
era co-founder Daphne Koller 
told a group of 50 at the Michigan 
League on Thursday.

Koller’s presentation, hosted 

by the Office of Digital Educa-
tion and Innovation, discussed 
the impacts of Coursera, a plat-
form for hosting the massive 
open online courses, or MOOCs, 
offered by a variety of universi-
ties.

The University was one of the 

first four colleges to run cours-
es through Coursera, and has 
offered about 22 courses on the 
platform for more than 3.6 mil-
lion users.

Koller, who is also a professor 

of computer science at Stanford 
University, began by describing 
the impacts of Coursera both on 
the universities that offer cours-
es and the professors who teach 
them.

In particular, she emphasized 

how online courses encourage 
professors to alter and improve 
their teaching techniques to best 
serve their students, who have 
the option of walking away from 
an online site at any moment 
compared to the more captive 
audience of a classroom.

“It caused me to completely 

reshape the way I thought about 
teaching,” she said. “And to 
think, ‘Why should the learner 
care?’ which is not a question I 
would ask myself before.”

As part of Coursera, instruc-

tors are given quantitative and 
qualitative feedback and are 
constantly able to improve their 
course. After negative feedback 
on a lesson, a professor is able 
to alter the lesson immediately 
rather than having to wait a 
semester, like with traditional 
college courses.

In an interview after the 

event, Information Prof. Charles 
Severance, who instructs a class 
on Coursera, said he often alters 
his teaching style for the online 
platform.

“When you’re on campus, 

we’re sort of in a hurry,” he said. 
“So online I always add a lot of 
extra stuff for the students. They 
really like it. For example, when 
they are learning programming, 
(we) show some video interviews 
of people like Daphne (Koller), 
and say, here, this is what a pro-
grammer has done with her 
career.”

Koller added that for colleges 

overall, especially those that 
were first on the platform like 
the University, hosting MOOCs 
broadens the institution’s reach.

“They’re reaching new audi-

ences who are now aware of the 
quality of scholarship the Uni-
versity has to offer,” she said.

Koller also spoke to the ben-

efits of teaching a more diverse 
population of students in MOOCs 
than in a traditional classroom. 
According to Coursera, more 
than 1 million students in 196

unnamed dystopian society with 
its main character, Katurian, as a 
short-story writer. After detectives 
discover 
an 
eerie 
similarity 

between the gruesome violence 
of Katurian’s stories and several 
recent child murders, he is brought 
in for questioning. When Katurian 
hears that his brother Michael has 
confessed to the murders, including 
sharing details on their twisted 
upbringing, 
Katurian 
suffocates 

him as a kind of mercy killing. His 
mission is to save his stories from 
destruction. Many of these stories 
are recounted within the play.

With two weeks to put together 

this five-week production, Rich 
casted the show based on the ability 
to capture the emotional depth of 
these highly complex and troubled 
characters.

“Each character is so specific 

and different in what they’ve 
gone through in life, and really 
an understanding of that and an 
understanding of drama is what I 
was looking for from actors,” Rich 
said.

one as recently as last week, and 
prompted calls for change in the 
department.

The 
officer 
was 
found 
to 

have been acting in lawful self-
defense by the Washtenaw County 
prosecutor’s office in January, who 
chose not to press charges.

On Oct. 4, the city’s Human 

Rights 
Commission 
released 
a 

42-page report on strengthening 
police-community relations in Ann 
Arbor specifically citing Rosser’s 
death and including a number 
of 
recommendations 
for 
the 

department.

In an interview Thursday, City 

Councilmember 
Kirk 
Westphal 

(D-Ward 2) said he was still 
reflecting on the recommendation, 
but that White left a good impression 
during prior opportunities Council 
had to meet with him.

“He struck me as being very 

thoughtful and professional, and 
highly experienced,” he said.

Speaking to some of the current 

events surrounding the AAPD, 
namely the HRC’s report, Westphal 
added that White noted having 
experience in such situations.

“He expressed having experience 

collaborating 
with 
citizen 

committees, and look(ing) forward 
to working with one here, if that’s 
the direction we go in,” he said.

Incoming City Councilmember 

Zachary Ackerman (D-Ward 3), a 
LSA senior, said he thought White 
was highly qualified for the job. 
Ackerman will formally assume 
his position at Monday’s Council 

meeting.

“I think (White) brings an 

incredible 
amount 
of 
diverse 

organizational 
skills, 
tactical 

skills, civil rights knowledge and 
psychology education,” Ackerman 
said. “And I think the four of those 
things, when brought together, 
will be incredibly valuable to the 
department.”

City 
Councilmember 
Sabra 

Briere (D-Ward 1) echoed those 
sentiments, noting that in meetings 
with Council White had expressed 
an interest in having a position in 
the department to foster community 
relations. 

She added that she thought his 

experiences in Detroit, including 
operating 
under 
the 
increased 

scrutiny of an emergency manager 
while the city was emerging from 
bankruptcy, would be beneficial in 
building trust in the community. 

White has served in his current 

position with the Detroit Police 
Department since February 2013. 
He began as an officer with the 
department in 1996, and has also 
served as deputy chief, commander, 
lieutenant and sergeant.

The Detroit Police Department 

said Thursday afternoon that they 
would not have a statement on 
White’s selection until Monday.

He received a bachelor’s degree 

in sociology from Wayne State 
University and is currently finishing 
a master’s degree from Central 
Michigan University in counseling, 
according to the release.

If approved, White will begin the 

job on January 11. 

Daily Staff Reporter Emma Kinery 

contributed reporting.

“That’s a great thing,” 

she 
said. 
“However, 
it’s 

not 
perfect. 
Particularly 

for 
those 
staff 
who 

identified as racial or ethnic 
minorities, they question the 
University’s 
commitment 

to diversity, because when 
they looked around, they 
didn’t see a lot of people like 
themselves reflected among 
their colleagues, among the 
leaders in their departments 
or 
at 
the 
University 

administrative level.”

In 
Fall 
2014, 
69.9 

percent of employees at 
the University’s Ann Arbor 
campus were white. When 
only considering faculty, the 
population is 72.5 percent 
white. Women made up 41.2 
percent of the faculty.

During 
the 
discussion, 

attendees broke into groups 
to 
give 
the 
committee 

feedback on their process 
and final report. Laurita 
Thomas, 
associate 
vice 

president 
for 
human 

resources who lead the staff 
committee, said feedback 
would be incorporated into 
the committee’s strategic 
plan.

“When we do the strategic 

planning 
action 
planning 

next term, we will reflect 
what we learned today and 
that should influence the 
overall 
direction 
of 
the 

strategic plan,” she said.

The 
report 
chiefly 

suggested 
the 
University 

include the concerns and 
aspirations of staff members 
in 
University’s 
larger 

diversity 
strategic 
plans. 

They also touted efforts to 
increase awareness about 
the value of diversity, equity 
and inclusion, as well as 
respect, in the workplace.

In 
particular, 
they 

recommended the University 
invest in training for staff 
involved 
in 
recruitment, 

hiring 
and 
promotion 

processes. 
Along 
with 

training, they requested the 
University enhance current 
leadership 
training 
to 

include elements of diversity, 
equity and inclusion.

Nichols 
noted 
that 

because of the University’s 
status as a federal contractor, 

it is an affirmative action 
employer. That means it has 
target numbers for hiring 
underrepresented 
groups. 

However, in the 2013-2014 
fiscal year, it only hired four 
members of those groups out 
of a target of 27.

The 
committee’s 

recommendations 
also 

called for the creation of an 
independent ombuds office, 
responsible for resolving the 
concerns of staff members. 
The aim: encourage staff to 
feel comfortable addressing 
workplace issues.

During 
the 
dialogues, 

many attendees said they 
were excited by the training 
and ombudsperson proposals 
because of their potential to 
be measurably implemented 
and achieve tangible results.

Event 
facilitators 

requested that the Michigan 
Daily not directly quote 
or record the small-group 
discussion portion of the 
event.

Speaking during the event, 

Linh 
Nguyen, 
associate 

director of the Office of 
Multi-Ethnic 
Student 

Affairs, said there was a 
need to create a confidential 
ombuds 
because 
not 
all 

units have an environment 
where staff and faculty feel 
comfortable talking about 
experiences with bias or 
discrimination.

“(It’s the) need to have 

someone who can hold that 
in confidence, support you 
through that, and connect 
you to the resources you 
need so that they can bring 
that to a larger space,” she 
said. “And that the unit or 
the department can really 
address 
it 
intentionally 

and specifically so we can 
actually move and resolve 
issues that were experiencing 
as staff, because we know 
that that impacts the rest of 
the campus climate.”

Overall, 
Thomas 
said 

from her perspective, the 
proposal for an ombuds and 
for increased training were 
the most mentioned during 
the event.

Other 
proposals 
were 

met with a more muted 
reaction, based on concerns 
that some of the committee’s 
recommendations 
could 

be more difficult to initiate 
in ways that would hold 

individuals accountable for 
success.

Multiple attendees also 

said though they thought 
the work of the committee 
was insightful, they worried 
the University would still 
be grappling with the same 
issues in the future if their 
recommendations failed to 
take hold within the larger 
University community.

Residence 
educator 

Miriam 
Rosado, 
who 

attended the event, said she 
thought 
the 
conversation 

was 
valuable 
because 
it 

seemed more substantive 
than past discussions.

“Right now, we have sort 

of the overall comprehensive 
formula, where we can really 
start the kind of work that 
we really need to do around 
diversity,” she said. “So I 
think this is much more 
comprehensive than other 
initiatives that I’ve seen — 
and that’s what really excites 
me. Because we have all the 
information and the data, we 
know where the barriers are 
and the challenges, and so 
then we could really begin 
the work.”

John Lofy, an assistant 

campaign director in the 
Office of Development, said 
he thought the dialogue was 
a valuable experience.

“It 
was 
a 
terrific 

opportunity to hear what 
the University is planning, 
to hear from my colleagues 
around the University who 
really care about this and 
want to do right by the 
University and its staff,” he 
said.

Thomas said she thought 

the Diversity Summit overall 
is an instructive experience 
for the University.

“The challenge that we’ve 

heard, the anger that we’ve 
heard, the stories that have 
been told, the enthusiasm 
we’ve heard for the way 
(Schlissel) is doing it this time 
is very, very encouraging,” 
she said. “This president 
has said that he wants to 
hear everybody’s voice, and 
therefore we’ve created a 
process of diversity, equity 
and 
inclusion 
strategic 

planning that should give 
everybody an opportunity to 
be heard about the Michigan 
we want to be.”

thought many of the patients facing 
issues with Medicare Plan D will see 
some changes moving forward due to 
recent changes in federal health care 
policy.

“Under the Affordable Care Act, 

this coverage gap known as the ‘donut 
hole’ will slowly be closed by 2020,” 
she said.

In terms of how a physician might 

use the model, Levine said she hoped 
clinicians would consider criteria for 
selecting a drug beyond going only 
physical well-being, and include met-
rics for cost and patient affinity.

“Certainly, we have to weigh the 

patient’s values and preferences when 
making these decisions about which 
drugs to choose,” she said.

countries currently use the platform.

She gave an example of Diane 

Kleiner, a professor of art history 
at Yale University, who teaches a 
Roman Archaeology MOOC. While 
Kleiner was already well-traveled, 
she was able to learn even more 
about her field from pictures her 
international students sent her.

Koller also addressed the other 

side of the Coursera platform — the 
type of individuals who take the 
course. With MOOCs, she said, there 
are three different types of learners: 
college-focused 
learners, 
enrich-

ment learners, and career-focused 
learners.

The college-focused learners, she 

said, take Coursera not as a substi-
tute to college courses, but rather to 
prepare for a different level of edu-
cation or to supplement a college 
course they are currently taking.

Engineering student Karen Lin, 

who attended the event, said she was 
an example of a college learner — as 
an international student from China, 
she took four Coursera courses in 
order to prepare for American col-
lege courses.

“The reason I took it was because 

I wanted to apply to (an) overseas 
school, but I didn’t have any experi-
ence in overseas classes,” Lin said. 
“I thought I would gain education 
experience in some U.S. institution.”

The majority of users, accord-

ing to Koller, are the career-focused 
ones, who are largely 25 to 35 years 
old. MOOCs, she noted, especially 
help millennials who switch jobs 
early on in their career, a trend she 
said is growing.

“Think of marketing,” she said. 

“Most people, when they learned 
marketing a decade ago, learned all 
about how to post ads in newspa-
pers. Now they don’t learn that. They 
learn how to post things on Twitter.”

Overall, Koller said, no matter 

the type of learner category they fall 
into, Coursera has made a large dif-
ference in many participants’ lives.

She cited, in particular, a Cours-

era user from Alabama, Scotty Rush-
ing, who was poor and living out of 
his car. Taking MOOCs — including 
one of Severance’s— turned his life 
around.

Severance said for him, hearing 

Rushing’s story served as a reminder 
of how meaningful the courses can 
be.

“For the students, this is some-

thing very, very special,” he said. 
“With so little effort on our part, we 
can share this with so many people 
and affect so many of their lives.”

to protect and respect the privacy 
of those sharing their stories. 
Microphones were placed both 
at the front and back of the room, 
providing individuals the option 
hide their identity by speaking 
from behind the crowd.

Many speakers said they were 

driven to share their personal 
experiences 
in 
light 
of 
the 

national debate surrounding calls 
for Congress to defund Planned 
Parenthood, 
as 
well 
as 
the 

prospect of the Supreme Court 
taking up Whole Woman’s Health 
v. Cole. If the justices uphold a 
lower court ruling in the case, 
almost half of Texas’s abortion 
clinics would close. The case 
considers whether Texas legally 
enforce laws that would have the 
result of limiting the number of 
abortion clinics.

Caroline 
Kagan, 
a 
Music, 

Theatre & Dance senior, said she 
had heard about the speak out 
since she was a freshmen, but this 
year felt particularly compelled to 
attend.

“I thought it would be interesting 

to come and hear everyone’s 
stories,” she said. “I wanted to 
come and support people who 
had actually been through a very 
serious issue that maybe Planned 

Parenthood guided them in.”

Business junior Nikki Yadon 

said she sees efforts to defund 
Planned Parenthood as a “bunch of 
political propaganda.”

“I 
think 
organizations 
are 

getting a really bad rep for 
providing these services and that 
shouldn’t be happening,” she said.

Many who shared their stories 

hoped to convey the various 
aspects of going through an 
abortion and the importance of 
having a right to choose. Others 
said they hoped sharing their 
stories would help them feel more 
at peace, as well as educate those 
in attendance — a key goal of the 
event.

LSA 
senior 
Connie 
Gao, 

Students for Choice co-president, 
said organizations like Planned 
Parenthood not only serve women, 
but also people of all kinds of 
gender identities. She said Students 
for Choice plays an important role 
in furthering that mission.

“We try to take a holistic 

approach to this issue,” she 
said. “We operate through a 
reproductive justice framework, 
where 
we 
recognize 
both 
a 

person’s right to choose and a 
person’s right to parent their child 
in a safe and healthy environment. 
I think having a campus presence 
that specifically reaches out to 
students is very important. I’m 
a strong believer in grassroots 
action.”

The GOP’s Hillary complex
I

n every debate, there are winners and los-
ers. Tuesday night’s fourth GOP debate in 
Milwaukee was no exception. Polls show 

a bump for Marco Rubio, 
Donald Trump dominated 
in terms of new followers 
and likes on social media, 
and Ted Cruz worked the 
audience like no other, 
with 13 minutes of speak-
ing 
time 
littered 
with 

applause and laughter.

On the other side, Jeb 

Bush failed to make any 
significant 
strides 
back 

into relevancy, and John 
Kasich was booed during 
his 
answer 
on 
bailing 

out banks. However, amid the fanfare and 
platitudes about what America is “really about” 
that typically accompany Republican debates, 
one candidate should feel pretty good about her 
position after this one: Hillary Clinton.

Billed as the debate about jobs and the 

economy, moderators from the Fox Business 
Network and The Wall Street Journal 
broached a variety of topics, from Syria to 
who on stage would have his or her tax plan 
endorsed by God to which five departments 
of government Ted Cruz would cut (spoiler 
alert: two of them are the Department of 
Commerce). Only one talking point, though, 
made its way into everyone’s remarks, and 
that was the Democratic frontrunner.

Hillary Clinton’s name was mentioned a 

total of 24 times in the two-hour debate, and 
at least once by each of the eight candidates 
(issues that were never mentioned, by the 
way, include race, making higher education 
affordable and campaign finance reform). 
She was called the worst secretary of state in 
history and the embodiment of cronyism. She 
was accused, along with Bernie Sanders, of 
not telling the truth about what’s hurting the 
middle class. She was challenged, in the third 
person, by Carly Fiorina.

Clearly, a requirement for any candidate 

during primary season should be electability 
and the potential to win a general election 
against an opposing party. But when was the 
last time, without an incumbent president 
running for re-election, that one person has had 
such a permanent and unshakeable target on 
his or her backs with the election a year away? 
All of this made one thing clear: Republicans 
have a major Hillary Clinton complex, and it’s 
not going away any time soon.

Why, then, does this make Hillary Clinton 

a winner? Simply put, constant attacks 
make GOP candidates look small, especially 
considering the fact that every charge leveled 
has been shrugged off by its target. The 
former secretary looks classier, more mature 
and more presidential with every dismissal 
of the clown car on the opposite side of the 
ticket next November. Not to mention the 
fact that in the long run, the American people 
are bound to tire of negative campaigning, 

if that is to be a central tenet of Republican 
campaigns for the next 12 months. And 
with articles titled “Who Can Beat Hillary 
Clinton?” being written in the hours after the 
debate, she seems like more and more of an 
inevitability for the Democratic nomination 
(likely to the chagrin of Sanders supporters).

Take how Fox moderator Maria Bartiromo 

began her question to Marco Rubio about 
whether anyone could compare to the 
“impressive resumé” of Hillary Clinton: “She 
was the first lady of the United States, a U.S. 
senator from New York and secretary of state 
under Barack Obama. She has arguably more 
experience, certainly more time in government 
than almost all of you on stage tonight.”

Seconds into the question, the entire 

audience started booing loudly. There are two 
explanations for this: One is that the audience 
of likely Republican voters thought it to be a 
bad question and that the former secretary 
of state, senator and first lady’s resumé is not 
impressive (which would be clearly biased 
nonsense). Another is that they know the 
opposite is true — that Hillary Clinton is 
qualified to be president and the sheer mention 
of her qualifications causes a knee-jerk 
reaction of moaning and woe in conservatives.

The simple fact of the matter is that primary 

season should be a time for candidates on both 
sides to connect with voters and determine 
the stances and issues that will resonate best 
with the people they are determined to lead, 
not a cage match to decide who gets to the 
title fight. As someone who is not registered 
with either political party and will not cast 
a vote in the primaries, I value the chance 
to see candidates get to know their base and 
how they steer their campaigns in certain 
directions based on the stories they hear 
and the people they meet. During Tuesday’s 
debate, though, it was difficult to see any of 
that, considering the only direction I saw 
from each campaign was straight to the 
White House and through Hillary Clinton.

Instead, I saw what will be the most glaring 

weakness of the Republican field thus far. 
It’s not Jeb’s family name or Carly Fiorina’s 
business record. It’s not Donald Trump’s 
unpredictable aversion to political correctness 
or Ben Carson thinking the pyramids were 
built by Joseph to store grain, though all of 
these come in a strong second place. It’s the 
fact that they can’t stop talking about Hillary 
Clinton and start talking about the issues. It’s 
the fact that mentioning her name can change 
a poor answer to an applause line. It’s the fact 
that sooner or later, the parade of negative 
campaign material is going to get old for the 
independent middle, which doesn’t necessarily 
hate the former secretary.

In case it wasn’t obvious, the constant 

demonization of one personality is not enough 
to base a winning presidential campaign on. 
Or at least it shouldn’t be.

F

reshman year, I joked to my 
younger brother, “You can 
be my roommate.” I wasn’t 

moving 
into 

a dorm, and I 
felt 100 percent 
OK 
with 
that 

decision. I didn’t 
have to worry 
about 
laptop 

theft, 
doing 

my laundry in 
coin-operated 
machines 
or 
sharing 
a 

communal 
bathroom. Now, 
three years later, I’m happy that 
I can still live with my family — 
the way I did during my first fall 
semester at the University.

My home is only about a mile 

away from Central Campus, and 
I’ve lived there for my entire college 
career so far. If anything, I believe 
it’s added to my personal experience 
of college and has made my time 
mean more by providing me with a 
calm, private place to go back to at 
the end of each day.

Kelsey Murphy, a junior in the 

School of Music, Theatre and Dance, 
lived at home for her first two years 
of college and feels similarly.

“The idea of living in a dorm just 

didn’t appeal to me at all,” she said.

Though her home was a little 

farther from campus than mine, she 
still found it worth the trip back and 
forth each day.

She continued: “I’m a very 

private, independent person, and I 
like having my own space to come 
home to at the end of the day and 
not having to share a space with 
someone I don’t know.”

Living at home also means that 

I have neighbors — neighbors who 
aren’t 
all 
20-somethings 
going 

to college or university. Actually, 

many of my neighbors teach at the 
University or at other colleges in the 
area, and they never fail to remind me 
that I should be doing my homework 
right now. In a neighborhood that’s 
home to people of many ages, I also 
find that my schedule has more of 
a regulated structure than when 
I spend my whole day on campus. 
Without my family members and 
their activities to provide me with 
perspective, the day tends to float by, 
divided up between classes, study 
sessions and meals, either from a 
lunchbox or a take-out box, often 
eaten over a piece of reading due for 
something later that afternoon.

Maybe the single most defining 

and important aspect of living at 
home is the cost — that is, the lack 
thereof. While Murphy was living at 
home, she was able to set aside money 
for the apartment she has now, which 
she finds a more desirable living 
situation than one that requires a 
long daily commute.

“I want to be more involved on 

campus and take part in more social 
events,” she said. “So it’s great living 
so close to everything. It makes my 
classes a lot easier, too, because the 
time I would have spent driving 
back and forth between campus and 
home I can now use for homework or 
catching up on sleep.”

That’s one of the drawbacks 

I’ve come up against as well — 
living somewhat far from campus 
makes it difficult to participate in 
extracurricular or late-night events. I 
don’t have my own car, so I’m reliant 
on the city bus system to get me to 
and from campus each day unless 
I arrange for a ride. It can also be 
difficult to meet up with friends or to 
plan spontaneously. But I don’t think 
that living at home has detracted 
from my “college experience” one 
bit — if anything, I believe it’s added 
deeper meaning to my time here.

Most importantly, it hasn’t left 

me coddled, which I think some 
people assume when I tell them 
about my living situation. If I use the 
kitchen, I have to wash my dishes. 
I do my laundry and help with 
vacuuming and other household 
chores, such as walking the dog 
(more of a highlight than a chore, 
in my opinion). I get to help haul 
groceries every weekend and also 
get to choose some of what food we 
have available during the coming 
week. When I’m home alone, I can 
play my music as loudly (or quietly) 
as I’d like, and on weekends and 
even during game days, I don’t need 
to worry about noisy partygoers.

Of course, living at home just 

doesn’t make sense for students 
coming to the University from other 
states or internationally. I can also 
understand the interest in getting 
your very own apartment, dorm or 
room in a house during your college 
years. But it makes sense to me, in my 
own personal situation, to live this 
way, and it’s worked well for me so 
far. I stay up to date on what my fam-
ily’s doing, have access to a familiar 
kitchen and food that I’m used to and 
get to raid my brother’s video game 
collection from time to time.

Maybe best of all, I can study 

without having to trek to the library. 
(Actually, scratch that. Best of all is 
getting to pet my dog.)

I’m on campus enough as it is; it’s 

nice to have a place to retreat to that’s 
far enough away to provide a big 
distance between my home life and 
school life. Murphy and I both agreed 
that for us, living at home for a year or 
two, or perhaps more than that, was 
the best decision we could make.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to 

go wash my lunch dishes!

The Weight of Your Words

I became exposed to the realities 

of racism during the relatively 
conflict-free and halcyon days of 
my childhood. Each year, I spent 
the months between September 
and June in Montgomery County, 
Pennsylvania 
— 
a 
supposedly 

progressive bastion in an increasingly 
regressive state. It was here where I 
learned about the Mayflower, Amelia 
Earhart and Eleanor Roosevelt, but 
not Benjamin Banneker, Sojourner 
Truth and Marcus Garvey.

My summers, though, were spent 

on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, 
at the site of what my grandparents 
told me was once Travellers Rest 
Plantation — a sprawling estate 
supposedly fueled by slave labor 
that produced wheat, corn and 
other staple crops. This land is 
where my grandparents settled 
down during retirement.

Afternoon walks in Travellers 

Rest yielded the discovery of many 
vestiges of a bygone age. I vividly 
remember walking by long-defunct 
train tracks, now covered in tall 
grass, and asking my grandfather 
why no trains seemed to pass. It was 
then that I learned how Southern 
plantations grew the food that fed 
the rest of the country.

On other walks, we would stroll 

past a long, willow-lined driveway. 
The driveway was so expansive, 
in fact, that the great distance hid 
whatever sat at the other side of it. 
Time after time, I would wonder 
what could possibly be at the end of 
that driveway. Eventually, I asked 
my grandmother. It was then that 
I learned about the elegant homes 
of slave masters and the depraved 
conditions the slaves lived in (I 
refrain from saying “the homes the 
slaves lived in” because that would 
be an insult to houses).

Another time, we passed a memo-

rial sign honoring Frederick Doug-
lass, who, according to local legend, 
was born as a slave in the next town 
over before escaping and attaining 
his freedom. At the time, the name 
meant nothing to me, and my grand-
parents could tell. So there I stood, on 
an old plantation in the summer heat, 
receiving a history lesson about the 
abolitionist movement. 

However, when I returned to 

elementary school every fall, my 
classmates and I went right back to 
learning about the Mayflower, Ame-
lia Earhart and Eleanor Roosevelt, 

but not Benjamin Banneker, Sojourn-
er Truth and Marcus Garvey.

It wasn’t until around seventh 

grade that we began to seriously 
talk about events like the slave trade, 
the Civil War and the Civil Rights 
Movement. But by then it was too late; 
my classmates had already developed 
their view of different races. Even 
though, thankfully, the vast majority 
turned out not to be hateful racists, 
they still lacked the history to 
understand the implications and 
repercussions of things as simple as 
the jokes they made toward me and 
other minority students.

In 10th grade, we read a short 

story in literature class about the 
Klu Klux Klan burning down Afri-
can American churches. After the 
teacher referred to the churchgoers 
as “Black” and “African American,” 
a classmate of mine raised her hand 
to inform the class that “they prefer 
to be called colored.” Obviously she 
meant no harm, but this just high-
lights the dangers of not informing 
children of the history behind racial-
ly loaded terms.

In 11th grade, when an Indian 

friend and I were both on the com-
puters in study hall, the substitute 
teacher approached us. “What grade 
are you guys in?” she asked. After 
finding out we were juniors, she 
asked my friend which colleges she 
planned on applying to. The teacher 
then turned to me and asked what 
I was planning on doing with my 
future. She then went on to describe 
the wonderful career her nephew 
made for himself in the army. She 
assumed that because I was a Black 
male, I was not qualified to move on 
in academia. I understand that she 
was trying to be helpful, but in doing 
so she made me feel as if I wasn’t tal-
ented or smart enough to be pursuing 
higher education, an unintentional 
side effect of her ignorance 
— of the 

weight of her comments.

In 12th grade, I received my accep-

tance to the University of Michigan. 
Out of the more than 1,000 students 
of North Penn High School’s class 
of 2015, to my knowledge, I was the 
only one to receive an acceptance let-
ter. This achievement gained me the 
nickname “Mr. Affirmative Action,” 
a superlative that still angers me to 
this day. My classmates belittled the 
work I put in over the past four years, 
attributing the fruits of my labor to 
nothing more than winning a ran-

dom outcome in a genetic lottery.

It was just earlier this year when 

my sister proudly told one of her 
school’s faculty members where 
I was going to college. “Oh! What 
sport does he play?” the woman 
asked. Dumbfounded, my sister 
pressed for some context. It turned 
out that the woman assumed I was 
admitted to the University for some 
athletic ability and not for my aca-
demic achievements.

“How is it possible for a 6’4” 

Black kid to not be good at sports?” 
she must have wondered. But in 
doing this, she was inadvertently 
asking, “How is it possible for a 
6’4” Black kid to be good enough to 
get into Michigan? There must be 
another explanation.”

Racism is like water; it seeps and 

thrives in every unguarded action 
and word. You may not know the 
water is in your ceilings until mold 
starts growing, and by then it is often 
too late. The ceiling must be torn 
down and a new one must take its 
place. More importantly, while the 
ceiling is down and the insides of the 
house are exposed, it’s essential to 
tackle the water leakage problem that 
caused the issue in the first place.

This must be done with racism. 

We can’t deny the problem that rac-
ism exists because, just like mold, the 
situation will continue to build up 
and create an increasingly danger-
ous environment. Likewise, we can’t 
only offer solutions that replace the 
ceiling — designating areas as safe 
spaces or banning this word and that 
phrase — because it’s only a matter of 
time before our efforts are proven to 
be wasted and the problem returns.

Instead, we must tackle the root of 

the problem by educating young child 
about the history of race relations. 
This can be done in many ways, from 
teaching children about race issues 
earlier in their lives to encouraging 
parents to have these hard conversa-
tions in an open environment with 
their young children — like the ones I 
received from my grandparents.

While these measures may seem 

like a drop in the bucket compared 
to tackling the policies that allow for 
the proliferation of institutional rac-
ism, at the very least it will inform 
people so they will think about the 
consequences and implications of 
what they say before they say it.

TV REVIEW

‘MasterChef Junior’ 
fun despite its issues

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

If there is one show that makes 

me feel like I’m underachieving 
in life, it’s “MasterChef Junior.” 
Entering 
its 
fourth 

season, the 
pint-sized 
spin-off 
of 

the hit FOX 
show “Mas-
terChef” 
continues to 
present chil-
dren of such 
culinary 
excellence 
that it puts 
most of its viewing audience to 
shame. I may be able to cook a 
burger, but I highly doubt I’ll 
ever make something that looks 
half as good as eight-year-old 
Kya’s Wagyu beef burger with 
two kinds of cheeses.

“I think it’s time for a girl to 

win ‘MasterChef Junior,’” con-
testant Avery says as she walks 
into the MasterChef Kitchen. 
For its first three seasons, 
male contestants have been the 
favorite sons of the series, with 
all three winners having been 
boys, along with two of the 
runners-up. This dominance 
stands in stark contrast to the 
adult-oriented 
“MasterChef,” 

which has boasted five female 
winners over the course of six 
seasons. However, the distribu-
tion of the final two contenders, 
seven females to five males, is 
far more balanced.

This dynamic between the 

two shows brings an eyebrow-
raising dynamic. While the 
show seeks to share culinary 
knowledge with a young gen-
eration, it has become increas-

ingly narrow in its selection of 
elite contestants. The lack of 
young diversity is a shame con-
sidering the wider represen-
tation present in the flagship 
“MasterChef” program itself.

By having one of its young 

competitors address the lack of 
female winners from the begin-
ning, 
“MasterChef 
Junior” 

seems to be challenging itself to 
broaden its horizons as it looks 
for its next champion among a 
sea of bright young faces that 
burst with energy.

It’s this enthusiasm and won-

der that carry “MasterChef 
Junior.” 
Representation 
and 

gender politics aside, the show 
is still, in many ways, a joy to 
watch. Gone are the petty rival-
ries and cynical reality show 
machinations of the adult alter-
native, replaced by the sincerity 
of childhood.

The common tendency of 

reality to turn characters that 
stand 
out. 
One 
contestant, 

Adam, emphasizes his Brook-
lyn origins and talks with the 
delivery of a stand-up come-
dian, while Avery, dressed in 
overalls, plays up her bayou 
roots with recipe a called the 
“Sportsman’s Paradise Burg-
er.” These basic archetypes 
are common, but “MasterChef 
Junior” steers away from the 

negative tendencies that type-
casting usually resorts to in 
competitive reality shows. No 
child is made out to be a villain 
or a jerk; they’re just kids that 
want be the best cooks they 
can be. Even though it’s been 
on for four seasons, the show’s 
pervading positive attitude still 
makes for a nice refresher from 
the inherent nastiness of sev-
eral reality competitions.

The 
universal 
encourage-

ment extends to the judging. 
Instead of resorting to put-
downs and angry rants meant 
to artificially heighten drama, 
judges Gordon Ramsay, Gra-
ham Elliot and Christina Tosi 
(her first time on “MasterChef 
Junior”) bring valid construc-
tive criticism. Tosi excels in the 
instance when presented with a 
marshmallow pie by contestant 
Alexander. The pie is, frankly, a 
mess and Alexander knows it, 
but Tosi searches for the good 
and offers necessary comfort 
for a young boy in a stressful 
situation.

This goodwill towards inno-

cence fosters a show with a 
constructive atmosphere. As 
Alexander and fellow contes-
tant Kade are eliminated, the 
rest of the participants gather 
around for a big group hug. It’s 
a common scene on the show, 
but the comforting sentiment 
continues to carry over across 
seasons.

“MasterChef Junior” still has 

issues of finding diverse cham-
pions; a challenge made even 
more difficult considering it’s 
hard for audiences at home to 
assess the abilities of the young 
chefs. However, the positive 
atmosphere continues to create 
a show that offers up the best in 
its young competitors.

Enviro-folk from 
Jeremy Loops

South African 

singer blends music 

and message

By CATHERINE BAKER

Daily Arts Writer

It’s seven in the morning and 

I’m woken up by the pounding of 
rain on my window. Panicking 
briefly that I’d left my car windows 
rolled down, I remind myself that 
I do not have a car here and I am 
not, in fact, still in high school. 
After this minor disruption in my 
heart rate, I soothe myself with 
the repetitive patter against my 
window and the sporadic flashes 
of light that illuminate my messy 
room. The beating of the raindrops 
is continuous and takes root inside 
my mind to make sure that I won’t 
get any more sleep tonight. And 
Jeremy Loops does the same. His 
use of new musical techniques and 
limited instruments create music 
that will linger long after it has 
stopped playing. Rain has always 
been associated with reflection, 
just like Loops’ lyrics on life, love 
and simplicity will make you 
think.

Jeremy Loops, originally from 

Cape Town, South Africa, is a mod-

ern folk singer and environmental 
activist. Speaking out for aware-
ness through both his organization 
Greenpop and his lyrics, he seeks 
to battle deforestation and travels 
around Southern Africa teaching 
underprivileged 
schoolchildren 

how to better protect their planet. 
His important ecological advocacy 
follows the similar messages he 
portrays in his music, combining 
traditional folk instruments with 
contemporary lyrics.

In 2014, Loops debuted at #1 on 

iTunes in South Africa and recent-
ly released his first full-length 
album Trading Change in August 
2015. Since this recent claim to 
fame, he has begun touring along-
side Twenty One Pilots in Europe.

Trading Change’s opening track, 

“Sinner,” is characterized by a 
quick banjo and gravely vocals, 
with lyrics that create a feeling of 
community around the idea that 
humanity is full of sinners. Loops 
displays his vocal range right off 
the bat, looping his own voice and 
instruments to create interesting 
and original layers of sound.

“Down South” was the first song 

from Loops I heard and the layered 
opening a cappella drew me in like 
a moth to a flame. Transforming 
into a full band sound while still 
maintaining a sense of simplicity is 

a talent I have only found in Loops. 
The lyrics, “Remember how we 
say / Someday we’ll set sail / It 
took me so much to get where we 
are,” dream of looking ahead to the 
future and still pleading for stag-
nancy in the present.

Combining all of these elements, 

“Trip Fox” utilized snaps, more 
banjos, strangely syncopated lyr-
ics and dueling harmonicas. “Tell 
me you’re living free / Tell me we 
can do it again” reiterates the same 
themes of being content where you 
are while dreaming of a place far 
away. Brandishing a wicked banjo 
solo (trust me, that feels just as 
strange to write as it does to read), 
“Trip Fox” transcends the label of 
“modern folk” and becomes simply 
amazing music.

“Running Away” showcases 

Loops’ versatility as an artist as he 
gets in touch with his rock roots, 
yet retains an aggressive harmon-
ica in place of a bass line. As the 
title suggests, the song glorifies 
escaping from all responsibilities 
and taking to a life on the road, a 
sentiment that most of us can echo.

I may not be in high school 

anymore, I may not have a car 
and I may not always be ready to 
move on from the past, but Jeremy 
Loops makes the future look pret-
ty enticing.

The play is set in an unnamed 

dystopian society with its main 
character, Katurian, as a short-sto-
ry writer. After detectives discover 
an eerie similarity between the 
gruesome violence of Katurian’s 
stories and several recent child 
murders, he is brought in for ques-
tioning. When Katurian hears that 
his brother Michael has confessed 
to the murders, including sharing 
details on their twisted upbring-
ing, Katurian suffocates him as a 
kind of mercy killing. His mission 
is to save his stories from destruc-
tion. Many of these stories are 

recounted within the play.

With two weeks to put together 

this five-week production, Rich 
casted the show based on the abil-
ity to capture the emotional depth 
of these highly complex and trou-
bled characters.

“Each character is so specific 

and different in what they’ve 
gone through in life, and really 
an understanding of that and an 
understanding of drama is what 
I was looking for from actors,” 
Rich said.

Although originally scripted 

as a cast of all men, Rich bent the 
gender of one of the detective 
characters in an effort to make 
the production more relatable to 
female audiences. The produc-

tion has innovated in other ways, 
too, in order to make such a mul-
tilayered play possible.

“When I first started thinking 

about proposing this show, it was 
two years ago and I said to myself, 
‘No, it’s too challenging of a piece,’ 
” Rich said. “I didn’t know how I 
was going to do the stories, because 
I wanted to do each one a different 
way. So now, we have shadow play, 
we have puppets, we have lighting 
changes, and we have some that 
are just stories read aloud.”

Expect laughs to turn to tears, 

breaths to be drawn and irresist-
ibly uncomfortable moments to 
last too long. Revel in “The Pil-
lowman” ’s bleakness and you’ll 
be just fine.

Balmain x H&M is 
style hype at its peak

STYLE NOTEBOOK

By JULIA DOYLE

Daily Arts Writer

The highly anticipated, highly 

promoted release of Balmain x 
H&M featuring designs by Bal-
main Creative Director Olivier 
Rousteing occurred this past 
Thursday, Nov. 5 at 8 a.m. To many 
a consumer’s displeasure, by noon 
that same day the only item left on 
sale was a tiny, simple, white ban-
deau. So what’s the deal?

Dedicated shoppers lined up 

for hours (and in some cases, days) 
outside of the various H&M stores 
lucky enough to carry the collec-
tion. Masses of people, men and 
women alike, waiting for those 
clear doors to open. Once they 
did, chaos basically ensued — on-
lookers videotaped the craziness 
of shoppers storming the racks. 
Comparable to a Best Buy on 
Black Friday, these H&M stores 
were 
completely 
run-through 

only minutes after the crowds 
stampeded. Online, the situation 
was far worse. The website was 
so flooded with volume that it 
completely crashed, and to shop-
pers’ disappointment, once it did 
go back online, all the items were 
gone. Sold out. Poof. Vanished. So, 
why all the hype? We chalk it up 
to two simple reasons.

The first reason for the unprec-

edented success was the campaign 
itself — what many would call a 
genius fashion marketing cam-
paign. If you have a social media 
account, the ads for this collection 
were everywhere. Not to mention 
putting Kendall Jenner’s face on 
anything at this point turns said 
item into coveted gold. But to use 
her face, name and brand alone 
wouldn’t have made this big of 
an impact. However, throwing in 

Gigi Hadid along with Jourdan 
Dunn was what added to the suc-
cess of it all. But still bear with us, 
because that wasn’t what made it 
stand out. It was the entire pro-
duction of the campaign. Lashy, 
high-fashion and constantly in 
your face — from a music video as 
edgy as the line itself, to a launch 
party so highly publicized by 
Kendall, Gigi and Jourdan them-
selves, to the sheer amount of star 
power at that launch party (Kylie 
Jenner, Ellie Goulding, Cameron 
Russell, among others), this cam-
paign was buzzed about since 
May 2015. Given the six months 
of unmatched anticipation for this 
line to drop, can’t say I’m too sur-
prised about the lack of hangers on 
the shelves. 

The second reason for such 

sold-out success is sheer quality 
product — the entirety of the line 
itself was fabulous. Yes, we estab-
lished that Kendall Jenner could 
sell essentially anything. But had 
these looks not been as great as 
they truly are, there’d be no reason 
for fans to line up. Rather, they’d 
simply look online at the pretty 
pictures of Kendall and Gigi walk-
ing hand in hand down the red 
carpet at the release, which at this 
point is the only thing most con-
sumers (including myself) can do 
with the line. Each piece encom-
passes the signature design, fit and 
look of Balmain as a brand, taken 
to new heights by Rousteing.

The pieces aren’t for those 

looking for simple cocktail attire. 
From huge pops of bright color to 
decadent patterns to colorful faux 
leather and decadent fur jack-
ets, each piece is bolder and more 
dauntless than the last. Clearly 
resolute in every piece from the 
collection, Oliver Rousteing does 

a fantastic job of making the line 
effortlessly edgy from head to 
toe. Encompassing the trademark 
black and gold silhouettes that 
Balmain is coveted for, Rousteing 
is not afraid to put a twist on these 
designs, made for the modern and 
high fashion woman.

While the collection itself is 

worth the hype surrounding it, 
it would seem that this collabo-
ration between high fashion and 
mass produced retail, between 
Balmain and H&M, is anything 
but for the masses. 

That being said, my hesitation 

with this line is the pricing. Yes, 
this is Balmain, but this is also 
being sold at H&M — a retailer for 
the average person. When people 
shop at H&M, their intention is not 
to drop $500 on a cardigan. Collab-
orations between a top tier design-
er and a retail store like H&M are 
created to provide an affordable 
way for us “average peasants,” we 
non-Kardashians to wear design-
er-quality clothing. Clearly H&M 
is missing the point here. In the 
past, H&M has done collabora-
tions with huge names. The list is 
endless and quite impressive: Stel-
la McCartney, Versace, Roberto 
Cavalli, Isabel Marant, Alexander 
Wang, Beyoncé, David Beckham, 
Karl Lagerfeld and so on. 

So it would seem everyone who 

is anyone in fashion, style and 
pop-culture has collaborated with 
H&M. Yet in each of these lines, I 
saw prices that soared above $400. 
Clearly H&M knows they can prof-
it on these lines. Unfortunately for 
us, the “average” consumers, we 
may just have to be content with 
looking at these designs from afar, 
because it would seem that appar-
ently the prices are not going to 
change any time soon.

Dear Gillian,
I love to paint, but all my best 

work is of nudes, and my mom 
doesn’t want

to hang them up in the house. 

I 
feel 
like 

she does not 
appreciate my 
talent

or worse — 

she sometimes 
seems 
embarrassed 
of 
my 
art. 

What should I 
do?

- 
Artist 

Under Wraps

*******

Dear Wraps,
The first thing we need to 

figure out is whether your mom 
doesn’t like your art or doesn’t 
like the nudity in your art. If it’s 
the art, there’s not much you can 
do. Though I’m sure your art is 
striking, everyone is entitled to 
their opinion when it comes to 
art appreciation and there’s no 
accounting for taste. I would 
say just ask your mom straight-
up if she thinks your nudes are 
pornography or just poor artistry. 

But let’s assume it’s the former, 

then I’d say your job is to help her 
work out her hang up and hang up 
your work out in the open. Don’t 
settle for a wall in the guest-room-
turned-storage-unit. Gallery space 
is difficult to score; you at least 
deserve prime real estate in your 
family home. 

While I can’t provide criticism 

on form and composition, I can 
comfort you with the knowledge 
that you are part of a timeless 
lineage of artists who have 
navigated the narrow straits 
between celebration and scandal 
when it comes to the nude 
subject (some have deliberately 
run aground on either side). 
Maybe your mom can take 
comfort in it as well.

On the ceiling of the Sistine 

Chapel, Michelangelo depicts 
the Temptation and Fall of 
Adam and Eve with two scenes 
in narrative sequence. On the 
left he paints the original couple 

blissfully nude, possibly in the 
middle of a shame-free sex act. 
On the right side is the moment 
after Adam and Eve have eaten 
of the forbidden fruit; the newly 
self-aware pair are leaving Eden 
shamefully covering their naked 
bodies. Art historian Kenneth 
Clark is great on the distinction 
between naked and nude: “To be 
naked is to be deprived of our 
clothes, and the word implies 
some of the embarrassment 
most of us feel in that condition. 
The word ‘nude,’ on the other 
hand, carries, in educated usage, 
no uncomfortable overtone … a 
balanced, prosperous and confi-
dent body.” This, Wraps, might 
be helpful in determining the 
interpretive 
framework 
with 

which your mother views your 
paintings. Are you rendering 
human vulnerability and eroti-
cism, or do your canvases glow 
with divine idealized beauty?

To follow one art historical 

thread down this path: Botticelli’s 
Birth of Venus is celebrated as an 
elegant and natural depiction of 
a nude, a goddess — an idealized 
form of a woman — and her 
sexuality is soft and unobtrusive. 
Titian’s Venus of Urbino takes 
one step toward the risqué 
plucking Venus from her heavenly 
surroundings and placing her in 
an earthly bedroom. Yet Titian’s 
soft application of paint and 
the graceful body language of 
Venus allow viewers to hold on to 
highbrow associations. Eduoard 
Manet 
steps 
defiantly 
over 

the nude/nakedness line with 
Olympia, first shown at the 1865 
Paris Salon where it was met with 
harsh criticism and outrage. With 
the same composition as Venus 
of Urbino, it’s the black choker 
of a prostitute and challenging 
gaze that render Olympia overtly 
sexual and shocking — viewers 
are forced to confront the sexual 
naked body and can’t hide behind 
the pretense of ideal beauty. It 
gets worse with Sally Mann’s 
Venus After School (1992), but we 
won’t go there.

I don’t know your gender or 

that of your nudes, but the naked/
nude division applies equally in 
depictions of the male body. From 
Michelangelo’s sculpted David 
in the early 1500s celebrating 
human beauty and excellence as 
those humanists liked to do in the 
Renaissance to Robert Mappletho-
rpe’s silver gelatin print Dan S. in 
1980 that toes the line between 
art and pornography. No discus-
sion about the history of nudity in 
art, not even in an advice column, 
is complete without a word about 
the gender dynamics of the artist/
subject relationship. I don’t know 
if the objectification of gaze is the 
right foot to start off on with your 
mom, but it probably affords the 
most insight into the topic.

In the visual arts, it is usually 

the subject that is nude. But 
in some of the other creative 
disciplines, 
it’s 
the 
artists 

themselves. Dance is a stark 
example. 
The 
(sometimes 

controversial) 
dance 
critic 

Alastair Macaulay approves of 
nudity in dance where it advances 
the artistic intent of a piece, 
such as by conveying intimacy 
or 
highlighting 
musculature 

where those are among the 
choreographic 
themes, 
but 

condemns it where it is purely 
prurient, raunch for raunch’s 
sake. He repeated ballet dancer 
Robert 
Helpmann’s 
famous 

observation 
of 
the 
problem 

with nakedness in dance: When 
you stop on the music, not all 
the parts of your anatomy stop 
at the same time, which leads 
to the conclusion that slow 
choreography can be done nude 
but a fast dance, only buck-naked.

So, my dear artist U.W., not 

to get too psycho-sexual, but as 
Milan Kundera’s “The Unbearable 
Lightness of Being” teaches us, 
there can be engrained personal 
aversions to the human body. In 
the novel, Tereza’s greatest fear 
is being reduced to nakedness 
with no way to distinguish herself 
from anyone else’s fleshy body. 
If your mom’s aversion is not as 
deep-seated as Tereza’s, take the 
most nude and least naked of your 
works, bring images and source 
materials of the great nude works 
of the creative arts and open the 

debate with your mom. I’m sure 
she’ll come around. Unless your 
work is all down by the naked end 
of the spectrum. That’s cool too, 
but you might have to get your 
own apartment.

 *******

Dear Gillian,
I sent my boyfriend a nude photo 

of myself and he didn’t say anything 
back.

Later, 
he 
replied 
via 
text 

message: “No thank you.” It’s hard 
not to

take this personally. Should I 

try again? Maybe from a different 
angle this

time?
- Laid Bare

********

Dear Laid,
I see how you would take this 

personally. Your gesture was 
one of giving and vulnerable 
commitment. 
In 
Federico 

García Lorca’s poem “Casido of 
a Reclining Woman,” he writes: 
“To see you naked is to remember 
the Earth, / the smooth Earth, 
clean of horses, / the Earth 
without reeds, pure form, / closed 
to the future, confine of silver.” 
 

Your body represents a lot, if not 
everything, and its gift should 
be accepted joyously and with 
wonder and gratitude.

A nude photo may serve the 

same purpose, after a fashion, 
as Walt Whitman’s poem “Song 
of Myself” in which he sings the 
song of himself, representative 
of his being, and shares it with 
the implied listener/reader of the 
poem: “I celebrate myself, and 
sing myself, / And what I assume 
you shall assume, / For every 
atom belonging to me as good 
belongs to you.” He, too, makes 
the distinction between naked (“I 
will go to the bank by the wood and 
become undisguised and naked”) 
and nude (“Who goes there? 
hankering, gross, mystical, nude”) 
in this piece. So I completely 
understand your resentment and 
your instinct to refuse to take no 
for an answer.

To my eye, L.B., your boyfriend’s 

response is not to the angle of the 
photo — I’m sure your photo was 
stunning — but rather is born of 
prudence. Perhaps he assumes 
you are opening up a graphic 
conversation in which he is meant 
to respond with a photo of his own 
nude body, and is rejecting the 
suggestion of this sext exchange. 
This particular art can be toxic, 
having felled its practitioners from 
teenagers — see the novelist Helen 
Schulman’s “This Beautiful Life” 
— to Congressmen, not to mention 
the effects on their loved ones.

“Nudity 
quickly 
becomes 

unremarkable 
when 
generally 

practiced,” wrote the philosopher 
Martha Nussbaum in “Hiding 
From Humanity.” Compared to 
the feelings stirred in the midst of 
your physical presence, the effect 
of the nude photo might just not 
do it for him. Worse, the prospect 
of having it available all the time 
might rob your intimacy of its 
specialness.

This, L.B., is not to say that 

nude selfies, well executed, cannot 
be artful and worthy forms of 
expression — they can. Look 
at the early expressionist Paula 
Modersohn-Becker’s Self-Portrait 
(1906) or Latoya Ruby Frazier’s 
Self Portrait United States Steel 
(2010). So maybe the solution 
here is to put your artistic all into 
your next photo, paying attention 
to lighting, focus and frame, not 
just exposure. Consider black 
and white or other monochrome 
effects. Try to achieve an image 
that conjures a mood much larger 
than the bare sum of the parts. 
Then, once you’ve got it firmly 
on the art side of the nude-naked 
continuum, send it via Snapchat!

TV NOTEBOOK
How ‘PC’ shapes 
our TV watching

PC culture has 

changed acceptable 

humor

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

There is one phrase I use at 

least once a day that is guaran-
teed to make my roommate roll 
her eyes every time: “That’s not 
PC.” (Of course, it could be pos-
sible that she’s rolling her eyes in 
frustration at the fact that I say 
it a lot when she’s watching “It’s 
Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” 
but I’ll get to that in a minute).

“Politically 
correct” 
is 
a 

phrase that has subtle differ-
ences in different contexts. If 
something isn’t PC, it’s offen-
sive or non-inclusive; a com-
mon example would be using 
certain words to refer to a per-
son’s identity (race, ethnicity, 
gender, sexual orientation, etc.) 
that aren’t socially acceptable 
anymore based on their history. 
The qualifier “political” stems 
from the fact that not using the 
PC term for something is a great 
way to find yourself with your 
foot in your mouth, at best — not 
a very dignified or comfortable 
position.

The concept of political cor-

rectness isn’t new. The third 
most 
popular 
definition 
of 

“politically correct” on Urban 
Dictionary is “the idealogy of 
weird left wing liberals who 
want society to be nothing but 
accepting of all perverts and 
freaks everywhere. The main 
basis is not to offend anyone 
with one little incorrect word,” 
written in 2003 by “John J. Cock 
Oiler” (The top definition was 
gross so I’m not retyping it).

However, the level of group 

censorship based on political 
correctness has been rising 
— and so has the level of 
impatience from those who 
think 
political 
correctness 

just means tiptoeing around 
the truth (at best) or insidious 

censorship (at worst).

Intellectual communities like 

universities and think tanks 
have been engaging in discourse 
about how a renewed emphasis 
on political correctness is bleed-
ing into our classrooms; Obama 
spoke on this himself recently 
in Iowa, disapproving of “cod-
dling” college students. And 
with the rise of social activism 
on social media, PC culture is 
spreading.

We could talk about the 

causes and effects of PC culture, 
and how they play into identity 
politics for weeks without run-
ning out of material, but some-
thing I have been thinking about 
recently — especially as the 
characters from my roommate’s 
shows like “It’s Always Sunny” 
or “30 Rock” are constantly 
screeching in my head nowadays 
— is how PC culture is affecting 
our TV shows and habits.

When I hear some of the jokes 

that made it onto the final scripts 
for episodes of shows like those, 
I sometimes find myself laugh-
ing in shock at how not PC they 
are. I know that “30 Rock” is sat-
ire, but I still can’t help but won-
der if many of their jokes that 
rely on tropes and stereotypes 
and would make the cut these 
days. This question is especially 
relevant for anything marketed 
as comedy. The line between 
satire and jokes that aren’t OK 
is becoming thicker and thicker.

The first time I fully realized 

this was after I watched the first 
episode of Amy Poehler’s “Dif-
ficult People,” a newish show 
on Hulu, in which a horrible 
character tweets a joke about 
Blue Ivy soon being old enough 
for “R. Kelly to piss on her.” The 
joke felt uncouth, even though 
I understood that the writers 
meant it to be a reminder of how 
R. Kelly was accused of urinat-
ing on and having sex with a 
teenage girl in 2002. I could 
understand why Black feminists 
especially were angry — jokes at 
the expense of Black women’s 
bodies are still all too prevalent.

Yet the show was slammed 

much harder than it would have 
been had it aired even three 
or five years ago. Similar jokes 
have made the cut time and time 
again on older, more established 
shows. People are more likely 
now to watch their shows online 
rather than live, and more peo-
ple engage in discussions pub-
licly online about what they’re 
watching. But when shows with 
cult-like followings air, discus-
sions about them often trend 
on Twitter immediately. So if 
something happens or some-
thing is said that isn’t PC, people 
quickly find out about it.

PC culture is changing our 

TV viewership habits in that the 
population of a show’s audience 
that is likely to engage in criti-
cal analysis about what they’re 
watching is growing — and they 
have access to media platforms 
from which they can spread 
their ideas. People are more like-
ly to take offense at things that 
weren’t meant to be taken seri-
ously, and some feel that they’re 
being unfairly treated by those 
that police political correctness.

What started out as trying 

to make sure everyone feels 
respected is sometimes turned 
into an exercise in hyperboliz-
ing satire and at times silencing 
those who don’t hold popular 
liberal opinions.

I have to bite my tongue some-

times and remind myself I’m not 
the PC police, but at other times 
I simply can’t help myself — I 
know, I’m everyone’s favorite 
classmate (or roommate — #sor-
rynotsorry, Rebecca). But I think 
that’s OK. PC culture represents 
good intentions that are some-
times taken to extremes, and it’s 
up to all of us to educate our-
selves on what those extremes 
look like. Our TV shows are 
sometimes the best examples of 
where the bounds of PC culture 
should be: we should know when 
to point something out for not 
being PC, and when to just shut 
up and have fun watching the 
damn TV show.

TV REVIEW
Aimless ‘Donny!’ has 
yet to find its footing

Uninspired comedy 
relies on tasteless 

jokes

By SAMUEL ROSENBERG 

Daily Arts Writer

One of the most common 

tropes in television comedies 
also seems to be one of the most 
entertaining: 
famous people 
playing fiction-
alized versions 
of themselves. 
Watching 
celebrities 
poke 
fun 
at 

their 
fame 

and 
fortune 

has 
become 

somewhat 
of 

a 
captivating 

concept for audiences. But while 
this formula has created some 
of the most critically acclaimed 
TV shows in history (“Seinfeld,” 
“Louie,” “Curb Your Enthusi-
asm”), it doesn’t always work. 
Unfortunately, USA’s new origi-
nal series “Donny!” seems to 
prove that.

Despite 
being 
sporadically 

funny, “Donny!” falters as an 
uninspired comedy that relies 
mostly on tasteless jokes about 
the media and celebrity culture. 
Playing the show’s womanizing 
eponymous protagonist, real-life 
TV personality Donny Deutsch 
certainly has some experience 
in the industry. Deutsch has 
led a successful career in busi-
ness as an ad executive and in 
television as a judge on NBC’s 
“The Apprentice” and a former 
host of CNBC’s “The Big Idea 
with Donny Deutsch.” Though 

Deutsch plays a fictionalized 
version of his real-life persona 
in “Donny!,” he exaggerates 
himself to the extreme and the 
results are neither as original nor 
as clever as they could be.

In the pilot “A Sext Ruined 

My Life!,” Deutsch’s character is 
introduced as the host of a talk 
show called “Donny!,” which 
looks like a cross between “Dr. 
Phil” and “Maury.” On the show, 
Deutsch’s first guest is a young 
woman named Becky, whose 
racy sext photo has become a 
viral meme on the Internet and 
deemed her as the “Psycho Sex-
ter.” Rather than sympathizing 
with Becky and her situation, 
Deutsch shows her picture to 
the mortified live audience, leav-
ing her in tears and even more 
distraught. While this scene 
may have intended to satirize 
the exploitative qualities of talk 
shows, it doesn’t provoke any 
laughs nor offer any insight.

Throughout the rest of the 

episode, Deutsch continues to 
squander every possible come-
dic moment with bland, insipid 
humor. In a brainstorm meeting 
with his thick-skinned associ-
ate producer Pam (Emily Tarver, 
“The Residuals”), Deutsch uses 
lesbians and cancer as ideas for 
topics to boost ratings for his 
show. Later on, while defending 
his relationship with his Rus-
sian girlfriend Galina (Tina Cas-
ciani, “Jane the Virgin”) to his 
concerned assistants, Deutsch 
suddenly breaks the fourth wall, 
promoting a product placement 
of Hak’s BBQ Sauce to the audi-
ence. Though this scene is prob-
ably a tongue-in-cheek reference 
to Deutsch’s real-life advertising 
repertoire, it feels incongruous 
with the show’s overall tone.

As Deutsch recently told Rot-

ten Tomatoes in an interview, he is 
intentionally playing an “idiotic” 
version of himself on “Donny!” 
Deutsch does indeed play an idiot, 
but one whose stupidity seems 
more obnoxious than hilarious. 
In this episode, he continually 
misunderstands the difference 
between a visual sext and a “sug-
gestive picture,” when they are 
clearly the same thing. In addi-
tion to denouncing Becky for her 
sexting situation, Deutsch takes a 
shirtless selfie, which is intended 
for Galina and accidentally sent to 
his daughter’s teacher. Of course, 
the racy selfie becomes viral like 
Becky’s and immediately causes 
bad publicity for Deutsch. At 
this point in the show, you would 
expect some sort of character 
growth from Deutsch, who would 
learn from his mistakes and rec-
ognize the irony of his actions. 
But instead of taking responsibil-
ity for his hypocritical behavior, 
Deutsch acts on this viral mishap 
for his own self-interest. When 
appearing on an MSNBC morn-
ing show, he markets the selfie as 
part of a made-up charity for car-
cinoma, dismissing the inherent 
issue of his sext, or what he con-
siders a mere “suggestive picture.” 
Though Deutsch has the charisma 
and natural delivery, his character 
is in dire need of some develop-
ment.

The one aspect that is surpris-

ingly refreshing about “Donny!” 
is the predominantly female cast. 
Deutsch and his young son Jag-
ger (newcomer Jacob Thomas 
Anderson) are the only two male 
characters present in the epi-
sode. But even then, the women 
on the show are portrayed in a 
stereotypical, 
one-dimension-

al fashion. Deutsch’s snarky 

two assistants Jackie (Hailey 
Giles, “Hustle & Flow”) and Zoe 
(Meera Rohit Kumbhani, “Weird 
Loners”) come off as mean-spir-
ited and his newest assistant 
Violet (newcomer Jessica Renee 
Russell) acts naive and desper-
ate to win Deutsch’s attention. 
His daughter Coco (Fiona Rob-
ert, “Law & Order: SVU”) is the 
typical spoiled, vapid teenager, 
who gets in trouble at school 
for cussing out a kid in Man-
darin. During her brief screen 
time, Galina is a purely sexual-
ized spectacle, canoodling with 
Deutsch and acting out a cheeky 
roleplay with him, in which she 
plays a Russian figure skater to 
Deutsch’s Vladimir Putin. Even 
Becky the “Psycho Sexter” from 
the opening scene is made out to 
be crazy and hysterical. Howev-
er, as conventional and clichéd 
as these roles may seem, the one 
character who mostly subverts 
the female TV stereotype is 
Pam, who uttered the funniest, 
sharpest lines by far.

While “Donny!” lacks the 

depth, heart and genuine humor 
of other meta comedies, the 
premise of a middle-aged, self-
obsessed talk show host could 
potentially 
make 
the 
show 

interesting. But at the moment, 
“Donny!” doesn’t really know 
what kind of show it wants to 
be yet. “A Sext Ruined My Life!” 
plays out like any other generic 
pilot, rushing and overlooking 
small details and not giving any 
room to develop an intriguing 
storyline. Perhaps its late time 
slot and its presence on a televi-
sion network filled with dramas 
that could be the problem. Nev-
ertheless, “Donny!” fails to make 
a lasting impression, even with a 
celebrity at its helm.

Donny!

FIELD HOCKEY
Lubbers a key 
to ‘M’ midfield

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

Many 
athletes 
who 
come 

to 
Michigan 
from 
different 

countries go through a period 
of adjustment to get used to 
their new surroundings and the 
traditions that go along with 
them.

For 
the 
Michigan 
field 

hockey team’s Veerle Lubbers, 
a 
sophomore 
from 
Arnhem, 

Netherlands, 
one 
American 

tradition 
has 
stood 
out 
as 

especially strange.

“It’s definitely the pumpkin 

carving,” Lubbers said. “I found 
out about it this Halloween. 
I tried the pumpkin carving 
myself, and I do not have the 
patience for it, to tell you the 
truth. I got frustrated, but it 
turned out my pumpkin that 
I picked was not a good one 
because it was yellow. Maybe that 
was it, because it was really thick 
and I could not cut through.”

Though some of the United 

States’ 
stranger 
holiday 

traditions may not make sense to 
Lubbers, the midfielder has had 
no trouble adjusting to playing in 
the States.

“Especially in Holland, where 

she’s from, field hockey is their 
No. 1 sport,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “They start 
playing field hockey when they 
are maybe 3 years old, so it’s like 
a basic motor skill for them. They 
learn it really early. Our players in 
the United States don’t really pick 
up a stick and play until they’re 
maybe 12, 13, 14 years old.”

On the field, Lubbers had an 

instant impact despite being in a 
system with completely different 
tactics than the one she grew up 
playing in. Accoding to Lubbers, 
Dutch players spend a lot of time 
focusing on stick skills while her 
time at Michigan has been very 

focused on being fit.

Last August, Lubbers made 

her debut against then-No. 2 
North Carolina and went on 
to start all 20 games for the 
Wolverines while setting the 
team record for assists in a 
season. This season, Lubbers has 
continued her strong play in the 
midfield — her nine assists in 19 
starts this campaign are good for 
second on the team.

“She reads the game really 

well,” 
Pankratz 
said. 
“Her 

instincts are really good and 
strong because she has been 
playing for so long at a high level.”

Saturday, Lubbers will help 

lead the 10th-ranked Wolverines 
into the NCAA Tournament 
against No. 7 Wake Forest.

Throughout 
her 
time 
at 

Michigan, her teammates have 
been there to support her any 
time she needed help, on or off 
the field.

“My teammates helped me 

out really well,” Lubbers said. “I 
mean, of course transitioning to 
school was difficult with all the 
new words that I had to learn 
for all the subjects, especially 
for biology and all that, but they 
were really helpful.”

In playing field hockey for an 

American 
university, 
Lubbers 

has an opportunity she wouldn’t 
have in the Netherlands. In her 
home country, academics and 
athletics are completely separate, 
making scheduling conflicts more 
difficult to work around.

“Here, 
(athletics 
and 

academics are) connected, so 
they understand each other,” 
Lubbers said. “If we have to 
travel, the teachers understand I 
am on the team here and you can 
make up for it another time.”

Lubbers is still transitioning 

to her new home, but pumpkins 
aside, it appears she’ll carve out a 
nice career at Michigan.

‘M’ hosts Niagara after bye

Wolverines face 
injury-plagued 
Purple Eagles in 
single game at Yost

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

After the his team’s 4-0 loss 

to Robert Morris on Oct. 31, 
Michigan hockey coach Red 
Berenson said 
he wished the 
Wolverines 
could 
play 
a 

game the next 
weekend.

Instead, the 

Wolverines 
had 
12 
days 

to 
prepare 

for their next 
opponent, 
Niagara 
(0-1-

1 
Atlantic 

Hockey 
Conference, 
0-5-2 overall), which they will 
face Friday at Yost Ice Arena.

But after Michigan’s first 

loss of the season, the bye week 
allowed the Wolverines (5-1-1) to 
regroup and work on individual 
skills.

“I wish we could’ve come back 

and played the next weekend 
coming off the Robert Morris 
weekend,” Berenson said. “But 
we couldn’t, so we had to take it 
the way it’s scheduled.

“I thought (the bye week) 

was a good combination of 
improvement 
and 
our 
team 

getting together with a little less 
pressure on them. Now we’re 
getting the team back to game 
mode this week, and I can feel 
a better sense of urgency this 
week from last week.”

In addition to the individual 

improvement, at least one roster 
change will be made — senior 
forward Boo Nieves will return 
to the lineup after being held out 
against Robert Morris due to a 
concussion.

Nieves’ return also allows the 

Wolverines to keep four separate 
lines, instead of shuffling players 

between lines every shift, which 
should create more fluidity and 
chemistry among the four lines.

“It’s good to have him back,” 

said 
senior 
forward 
Justin 

Selman. “He compliments me 
and (freshman forward) Kyle 
Connor very well. Having a guy 
like him playing in the middle 
so I can get back on the wing is 
great too. He brings a lot of speed 
to our line.”

But 
for 
a 

team 
that 

has 
averaged 

just 
under 

four goals per 
game, creating 
offense 
isn’t 

the 
problem. 

Rather, 
the 

problem is that 
Michigan has 
also given up 
an average of four goals per game.

While it hasn’t been entirely 

the goaltenders’ fault, neither 
junior Zach Nagelvoort nor 
senior Steve Racine has been 
able to establish himself in goal.

“You look at our goalies’ goals-

against (average), and it’s too 
high,” Berenson said. “It’s pretty 
hard for me to tell you that I like 
anybody’s game when our save 

percentage is under .900 and our 
goals against is over 3.00.”

But if there were any time 

for one of the goaltenders to get 
their game going, a game against 
a winless Niagara team could 
be it, especially for Nagelvoort. 
Last time the two squads met in 
2013, Nagelvoort earned a 6-0 
win for the first shutout of his 
Michigan career.

In 
that 

game, 
junior 

forward Tyler 
Motte had a 
goal and two 
assists, while 
his line mate, 
junior forward 
Alex 
Kile, 

registered his 
first goal as a 
Wolverine.

This 
time 

around, 
the 
Purple 
Eagles’ 

resume doesn’t leave much room 
for doubt that the result will be 
any different this time around.

Niagara comes into the game 

winless after a late Penn State 
goal denied the Purple Eagles 
their first win of the season. 

The biggest problem Niagara 

has faced this season, though, 
is the injury bug, which has 

forced underclassmen to play big 
minutes.

One example is in goal, where 

freshman goaltenders Guillaume 
Therien and Joe O’Brien have 
split time between the pipes due 
to an injury to seasoned veteran 
Jackson Teichroeb, who started 
32 of 37 games for the Purple 
Eagles last year.

Niagara is also missing its top 

two centers, TJ Sarcona and Rob 
Angiolella, as well as a top-four 
defenseman, Matt Chiarantano.

Despite all of the Purple 

Eagles’ 
struggles, 
Michigan 

won’t be taking them lightly.

“They’re one of those teams 

that we don’t see very often, 
so we don’t know too much of 
what to expect,” Selman said. 
“They’re going to be excited to 
play us on the road, especially 
at Yost. They’ve tied two good 
teams in Penn State and Robert 
Morris, so we definitely can’t 
take them lightly.”

And the Wolverines shouldn’t, 

because 
college 
hockey 
is 

an 
unpredictable 
game 
and 

anything can happen on any 
given night.

Michigan will just need to 

work hard to make Niagara as 
predictable as possible.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Michigan opens 
vs. Binghamton

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball 
team 
may 
not 

be 
opening 
with 
marquee 

opposition, but 
playing on back-
to-back days is 
the type of initial challenge coach 
Kim Barnes Arico wants to see 
her team respond to.

Binghamton will visit Crisler 

Center on Saturday for the 
Wolverines’ first game of the 
2015-16 season. Michigan will 
then make the short trip to 
Detroit on Sunday to finish the 
weekend doubleheader.

With the end goal of a return 

to the NCAA Tournament, a place 
they haven’t been since 2013, the 
Wolverines are hoping to grab 
momentum right from the start.

Michigan already appears to be 

firing on all cylinders after several 
players put together impressive 
performances in last Sunday’s 
exhibition win over Ferris State.

The 
Wolverines’ 
freshman 

trio of center Hallie Thome and 
guards Lauren ‘Boogie’ Brozoski 
and Nicole Munger had an instant 
impact against the Bulldogs.

The 
freshmen 
showed 
no 

signs of wearing down against 
Ferris State, but Barnes Arico will 
monitor how her younger players 
deal with the fatigue of playing on 
back-to-back days.

“With the freshmen, it’s going 

to be the grind of the season,” 
Barnes Arico said. “How much 
they can handle bouncing back 
from 
playing, 
then 
playing 

another game a few days later. 
That determines how ready they 
are.”

Neither 
the 
Bearcats 
nor 

Titans are expected to put up a 
huge challenge for the Wolverines 
— the two teams had a combined 
16-44 record in 2014-15 — but 
they will give Barnes Arico the 
first chance to evaluate her young 
players’ fitness.

RULE CHANGES: Saturday 

will also be the first competitive 

matchup for Michigan under the 
new NCAA rules package.

Most changes are related 

to the switch from 20-minute 
halves to 10-minute quarters. 
There will be one media timeout 
at the first stoppage under five 
minutes in each quarter. Team 
fouls will also be accumulated 
by quarter, and teams reach the 
double bonus on the fifth team 
foul of each period.

After made baskets or once 

possession is secured with under 
a minute left in the fourth quarter 
and overtime periods, teams will 
be allowed to advance the ball to 
the frontcourt when a timeout is 
called. The change is meant to 
add exciting possessions at the 
end of games, replicating a similar 
rule used in the WNBA.

Other 
major 
adjustments 

include a reduction in the shot 
clock from 35 to 30 seconds, 
a decrease in allotted team 
timeouts from five to four and a 
policy lessening the frequency 
of hand-check fouls on post 
defenders.

SIGNING 
DAY: 
Michigan 

announced on Wednesday the 
signing of four players for its 2016 
class. Guard Kysre Gondrezick 
has received the most national 
attention. The Benton Harbor, 
Mich., native was ranked No. 70 
in ESPN’s HoopGurlz ratings 
and is regarded as the top-rated 
player in the state. 

Toledo 
Rogers 
teammates 

Akienreh Johnson and KeAsja 
Peace will stay together when 
they arrive in Ann Arbor next 
fall. Johnson, a 6-foot guard, and 
Peace, a 6-foot-3 forward, were 
each given three-star ratings by 
HoopGurlz and will add much-
needed height to Barnes Arico’s 
lineup next season.

Rounding out the class is 

6-foot-1 forward Kayla Robbins. 
The 
Maryland 
native 
is 
a 

natural small forward who has 
great rebounding and shooting 
ability. Robbins, rated No. 93 by 
HoopGurlz, will add versatility 
and athleticism to Michigan.

RITA MORRIS/Daily

Fifth-year senior Jake Rudock is coming off his best game of the season.

FOOTBALL
Breakdown: ‘M’ vs. Indiana

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

For most of its season, the 

Indiana football team has had to 
settle for “close.”

Already 
this 
season, 
the 

Hoosiers 
(0-5 
Big 
Ten, 
4-5 

overall) have lost to then-No. 1 
Ohio State by seven points and 
then-No. 9 Iowa by eight points. 
They trailed then-No. 7 Michigan 
State by just five with five minutes 
remaining, but couldn’t keep it 
together, losing by 26. They were 
in every one of those games. They 
just couldn’t finish.

So when No. 14 Michigan goes 

to Bloomington on Saturday, the 
Wolverines will be taking on a 
team that’s better than its record 
suggests.

Here’s how the Daily breaks 

down the upcoming matchup.

Michigan pass offense vs. 

Indiana pass defense

Fifth-year senior quarterback 

Jake Rudock isn’t the nation’s 
most exciting signal-caller, but 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said Rudock has stepped his 
game up lately, even saying he has 
resembled an NFL quarterback 
this week.

Rudock had a career-high 337 

yards against Rutgers, throwing 
for two touchdowns and running 
for one in his best game of the 
season. Indiana has given up the 
second-most passing yards per 
game in the nation the season, 
ahead of only Kansas.

Junior tight end Jake Butt 

had a big game last week for 
Michigan, racking up 102 yards 
on four catches, and is a threat 
to replicate those numbers any 
given week in Harbaugh’s offense. 
Outside of Butt, redshirt junior 
wide receivers Amara Darboh and 
Jehu Chesson have developed into 
reliable targets on any down. Add 
in a screen game that continues 
to pay big dividends, and the 
Wolverines have many weapons 

at their disposal.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan rush offense vs. 

Indiana rush defense

On 
the 
surface, 
Indiana’s 

48th-ranked rush defense doesn’t 
look too bad. But that average is 
buoyed by games against Florida 
International, Western Kentucky 
and Wake Forest. Outside of those 
games, the Hoosiers have been 
susceptible to the ground game.

Ohio State’s Ezekiel Elliott 

rushed for 274 yards and three 
touchdowns 
against 
Indiana. 

Rutgers’ Robert Martin ran for 
124 yards and three touchdowns. 
And Southern Illinois gained 248 
yards rushing as a team.

The Hoosiers are giving up 161 

yards and two touchdowns on 
the ground to ranked teams this 
season, which could play well for a 
Michigan team that likes to pound 
the football and has the weapons 
to do so.

Redshirt 
junior 
running 

backs De’Veon Smith and Drake 
Johnson provide a speed/power 
combo that, if both are healthy, 
can keep opposing defenses off 
balance.

Unless Indiana can play its 

best defensive game of the year, 
Michigan should be able to do 
what it wants on offense, and that 
starts with the running game.

Edge: Michigan

Indiana 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan pass defense

Though 
Michigan’s 
pass 

defense is giving up the third-
fewest yards per game in the 
nation, it has been vulnerable 
against great quarterbacks this 
season. Michigan State’s Connor 
Cook and Minnesota’s Mitch 
Leidner all threw for big yards 
against the Wolverines, and both 
would have beaten them had the 
Golden Gophers not been stopped 

on a last-second goal-line stand.

With that in mind, Michigan 

will 
need 
to 
limit 
Indiana 

quarterback Nate Sudfeld to have 
success on Saturday.

Sudfeld has thrown for 2,229 

yards through nine games, and 
wide receiver Ricky Jones has 
totaled 708 receiving yards. That 
means junior cornerback Jourdan 
Lewis will likely be tasked with 
covering Jones, fresh off a week in 
which Lewis broke the Michigan 
single-season record for pass 
breakups.

Lewis has been burned in only 

one game this season — when the 
Spartans’ Aaron Burbridge caught 
nine passes for 132 yards — and 
even then, he made his impact felt, 
breaking up six passes.

Edge: Michigan

Indiana rush offense vs. 

Michigan rush defense

If running back Jordan Howard 

can get going, the Hoosiers offense 
becomes 
quite 
intimidating. 

Indiana plays the fastest tempo 
Michigan will face all year, and 
if the Hoosiers can combine their 
tempo with a productive run 
game, the Wolverines could get 
worn out.

Howard has been steady in 

nearly every game this season 
except against Ohio State, when 
he was held to 34 yards on 14 
carries, 
and 
Michigan 
State, 

when he gained 78 yards on 11 
touches. He has gained over 140 
yards every other time out, but his 
subpar showings against two rush 
defenses on Michigan’s level do 
not bode well for him going into 
Saturday.

Keeping Howard in check 

will be a concern all game for 
the Wolverines, and it will only 
be tougher if redshirt junior 
defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow 
can’t play. Glasgow’s status is 
uncertain after being in a sling 
this week, and if he can’t go, 
Michigan’s depth at the position 

could become a problem.

Still, the Wolverines have the 

nation’s No. 3 rush defense, and 
they should be plenty capable 
of staying tough, even without 
Glasgow.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Behind new special teams 

coach John Baxter, Michigan 
has turned its special teams into 
one of the nation’s best units. 
Chesson has already returned 
one kick for a touchdown, and 
redshirt freshman safety Jabrill 
Peppers has been close on 
numerous punts and kicks. It 
feels like the Wolverines could 
break a big play on special teams 
at any time.

Michigan 
and 
Indiana’s 

punting units are separated by just 
0.1 yards per punt, but Indiana’s 
Griffin Oakes gives the Hoosiers 
a slight edge in the kicking game, 
hitting 12 of 14 on the season.

Still, Michigan is ranked first 

in the country in special teams 
efficiency, and Indiana is 79th. 
That should tell you all you need 
to know.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

The Hoosiers are talented 

enough to knock off any team in 
the conference, and the fact that 
they’ve fallen short so many times 
could boost their motivation 
against 
their 
final 
ranked 

opponent this season.

Harbaugh 
has 
had 
the 

Wolverines prepared for every 
game so far this season, but if 
Indiana can finally put it all 
together, the Hoosiers could be a 
big problem.

Indiana trip opens 
final stretch of year

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

The doldrums of the college 

football season are a thing of the 
past. The final three weeks of 
the schedule typically represent 
a time of chaos, rankings turned 
upside down and upsets left and 
right.

The 
No. 

14 
Michigan 

football 
team, 

as 
evidenced 

by last-second 
finishes against 
Michigan State 
and Minnesota, 
has 
already 

endured 
its 

share of drama 
this 
season. 

Now, 
with 

two 
games 

remaining 
before 
that 

big 
one 
on 

Thanksgiving 
weekend, 
the 

Wolverines will be tasked with 
staying on par for the course.

First up for Michigan is Indiana 

(0-5 Big Ten, 4-5 overall). The 
Hoosiers, despite their lackluster 
conference 
record, 
have 

presented a challenge to some 
of their most difficult Big Ten 
opponents this season. Indiana 
took No. 3 Ohio State down to the 
wire, falling by just seven points. 
The Hoosiers also hung with No. 
13 Michigan State well into the 
second half last month before the 
Spartans turned the game into a 
blowout late in the fourth quarter.

Indiana is largely a threat to the 

Wolverines because of its offense. 
The Hoosiers have accumulated 
the second-most yards and fifth-
most points of any team in the Big 
Ten this season, hardly statistics 
for a cellar dweller. The Hoosiers 
have scored fewer than 26 points 
on only one occasion this season, 
when Penn State limited them to 
just seven on Oct. 10.

Though Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh said Monday that he 
would make sure his team was 
aware of the larger implications 
of the final three games of the 

season, his players feel as though 
Indiana is enough of a challenge 
to keep them from worrying 
about conference championships 
and the slim possibility of a 
playoff berth just yet.

“Everything boils down to this 

game,” said redshirt sophomore 
defensive tackle Maurice Hurst 
on Tuesday. “We can’t focus on 
what’s up next, especially when 
we’re playing a team like Indiana 
that’s scored on everybody.”

The 
Hoosiers’ 
defense, 

however, hasn’t lived up to its end 
of the bargain. The unit is last 
in the Big Ten in points (37) and 
yards (504) allowed per game.

Indiana’s 
porous 
defense 

will give Michigan’s offense the 
opportunity to build off of its 
performance 
against 
Rutgers 

in which it compiled 487 yards. 
Fifth-year 
senior 
quarterback 

Jake Rudock played his best game 
of the season, completing 18 of his 
25 passes for 337 yards and two 
touchdowns.

Rudock’s performance inspired 

high praise from Harbaugh.

“He even looked like an NFL-

type quarterback,” Harbaugh said 
Monday. “You know, somebody 
who would have a future playing 
in that league.”

This is a welcome development 

for the Wolverines, particularly 
after Rudock struggled from 
bouts with turnovers early in 
the season. A second straight 
good 
performance 
against 

Indiana would inspire further 
confidence as Michigan heads 
into the home stretch.

A win against the Hoosiers 

would keep the Wolverines alive 
in the Big Ten race. Then comes 
another road game at Penn State, 
a place where Michigan has had 
some trouble in recent memory. 
And then, if things hold to form and 
the Buckeyes defeat the Spartans 
next weekend, the Wolverines 
will play their chief rival for the 
division title on Nov. 28.

But things rarely tend to work 

out as planned toward the end 
of the college football season. 
Michigan will look to take care of 
its part Saturday.

What to Watch For Saturday

‘M’ prepares to face 
Indiana’s up-tempo 

offense in fourth 
road game of 2015

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The home stretch of the season 

has arrived, and the Michigan 
football 
team’s 
goals 
are 

suddenly within reach. The Nov. 
28 rivalry game against Ohio 
State looms larger than ever, but 
first the Wolverines (4-1 Big Ten, 
7-2 overall) must take care of 
business on the road.

They play at Indiana (0-5, 4-5) 

on Saturday and at Penn State 
next weekend. The first test in 
Bloomington could be tricky, 
considering the Hoosiers have 
the offense to pile up points 
against anybody, even on a five-
game losing streak.

Indiana has been on the brink 

of an upset multiple times this 
season, but historically, upsets 
have not come against Michigan 
for the Hoosiers. The Wolverines 
own the all-time series, 54-9, 
and have won 17 straight dating 
back to 1988. Even during their 
lean years in 2009 and 2010, they 
escaped with 36-33 and 42-35 
wins, respectively.

But once again, a victory on 

the road is no sure bet. With a few 
unknowns remaining, there will 
be plenty to watch for Saturday. 
Here are a few highlights.

1. Tempo, tempo, tempo.

Indiana 
may 
not 
be 
the 

toughest test Michigan’s defense 
will face this season, but it will be 
unique. The Hoosiers’ no-huddle 
attack runs 2.73 plays per minute, 
ranking 17th in the nation. The 
Wolverines have not seen an 
up-tempo offense since their 
first two games against Utah and 
Oregon State.

To 
make 
matters 
more 

complicated, 
redshirt 
junior 

defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow 
left last Saturday’s game with 
a shoulder injury and had his 

arm in a sling this week. If he 
can’t play Saturday, redshirt 
sophomore Maurice Hurst is 
the only nose tackle left on the 
depth chart. The Wolverines 
rotate often on the defensive 
line, so that could mean a bigger 
workload for redshirt juniors 
Matt Godin, Chris Wormley or 
Willie Henry.

On offense, Indiana has enough 

weapons to spread the field and 
test Michigan’s defense. Nate 
Sudfeld, a third-year starter at 
quarterback, is healthy and has 
averaged 278.6 yards in eight 
games. Running back Jordan 
Howard, who missed two games 
earlier in the season, has rushed 
for 961 yards at 6.1 yards per carry.

No 
team 
will 
run 
the 

Wolverines’ stout defense off the 
field, but the Hoosiers could at 
least make things interesting.

2. How does Michigan look on 

the road?

The Wolverines’ results away 

from home have run the gamut. 
They opened the season with 
a sluggish, three-turnover loss 
at Utah. They dominated an 
outmatched 
Maryland 
team 

four weeks later, 28-0. And they 
escaped with a hard-fought 29-26 

win over Minnesota two weeks 
ago in the most tightly contested 
of the three.

The 
matchup 
with 
Ohio 

State on Nov. 28 only matters if 
Michigan can remain unscathed 
until then. Though Bloomington 
doesn’t fit on the same level as 
the top schools in the Big Ten 
when it comes to hostile road 
environments, the Wolverines 
must be wary. And they must 
make another trip to Penn State 
next week.

The Hoosiers have lost five in 

a row, but they have been within 
one possession of a top-10 team in 
two of them.

3. Where on the field is Jabrill 

Peppers?

The 
hype 
surrounding 

Michigan’s redshirt freshman 
safety has only increased as the 
season has gone on and Peppers 
has played more roles. In the 
past three games, he has made 
an impact in all three phases, 
and he now ranks third on the 
team with 470 all-purpose yards 
despite spending most of his time 
on defense.

Last week, the coaches rolled 

back Peppers’ workload for the 
first time this season, putting 

junior cornerback Jourdan Lewis 
on the kick return team in his 
place. He also sustained a thigh 
contusion last Friday on a collision 
in practice. Lately, Peppers’ snap 
count has risen, and against 
Indiana’s up-tempo offense, that 
might be tough to sustain. How 
much rest the Wolverines give 
him remains to be seen.

4. Can Jake Rudock keep 

making strides?

The 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback’s 
teammates 

and coaches have been vocal 
all 
season 
about 
Rudock’s 

improvement, but the praise was 
louder than ever after Rudock’s 
career-high 337 passing yards 
against Rutgers last week.

Michigan’s defense has played 

the biggest role in the team’s 
success this season, but Rudock 
will be counted on most during 
the final three games. If Saturday 
turns into a shootout, he may 
have to air the ball out. Indiana’s 
pass defense ranks 126th in the 
country and has allowed an 
average of 339 yards over the past 
three games. If Rudock carries 
over last week’s success into this 
week’s game, the Wolverines will 
be tough to beat.

Follow Daily Sports on Twitter: @theblockm

At this time last year, the Michigan men’s basketball team looked 
poised for another run at a Big Ten title. Instead, the injury-riddled 
Wolverines missed postseason play altogether. This season, 
Michigan returns 11 of 12 scholarship players. Senior co-captains 
Caris LeVert and Spike Albrecht have a chance to relive the glory of 
their 2013 Final Four run, and Michigan’s size, depth and backcourt 
talent make a trip deep into March a distinct possibility. But as last 
year shows, the Wolverines can afford to take nothing for granted.


LEV
FACHER

Michigan’s blessing in disguise

C

aris LeVert is clutching his 
left foot in agony, a buzzer 
sounds, and the sellout 

crowd at Crisler Center is stand-
ing and cheering. It’s January 17, 
2015, and everybody in the build-
ing is celebrat-
ing Michigan’s 
56-54 win over 
Northwestern. 
Everybody, 
that is, except 
for LeVert.

The 

prognosis 
for the 
Wolverines’ 
leader in every 
meaningful 
statistical category and a near-
certain first-round NBA draft 
pick is initially unclear. But with 
the next day’s news that LeVert’s 
foot injury will force him to miss 
the rest of the season, Team 
99’s hopes of contending in a 
competitive Big Ten are dealt a 
crushing blow.

Lost in translation is the 

obvious advantage: Team 100 is 
getting a head start.

Fast-forward two weeks, 

and Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman is putting on a show 
in East Lansing. The then-
freshman guard’s 18-point 
performance Feb. 1 brings a 
Michigan team without its 
starting backcourt — yes, 
Derrick Walton Jr. is also out 
of commission with a toe injury 
— to overtime against a bigger, 
more experienced Michigan 
State unit.

Abdur-Rahkman was not 

supposed to play meaningful 
minutes in 2014-15. But by sheer 
process of elimination, Michigan 
coach John Beilein was forced 
to throw the true freshman into 
the fire, alongside classmate and 
backcourt accomplice Aubrey 
Dawkins.

Dawkins, in his own right, 

also had no business putting up 
16 points against Iowa four days 
later, or 31 against Rutgers and 
18 against Illinois in consecutive 
games as the injury-riddled 
season mercifully came to a 
close.

But with LeVert gone, the pair 

had no choice. Michigan needed 
scorers, it needed ball-handlers, 
and it was out of options. Enter 
Dawkins. Enter Abdur-Rahkman. 
Sometimes, they looked lost. 

Sometimes, Abdur-Rahkman 
rained down 3s. Sometimes, 
Dawkins made SportsCenter 
after posterizing players across 
the Midwest.

Dawkins’ quiet confidence 

is apparent, and he doesn’t 
twist reality. He’s said he never 
expected to enter his sophomore 
year with this much experience, 
with this much confidence, with 
this much responsibility. Nobody 
did.

All of a sudden, between 

Dawkins, LeVert, Walton, 
Abdur-Rahkman, senior Spike 
Albrecht and sharpshooting 
transfer Duncan Robinson, 
Beilein has more options than 
he knows what to do with in 
the backcourt. In a college 
basketball landscape dominated 
by ballhandlers, and in Beilein’s 
guard-heavy offense, expect a 
Wolverine onslaught. They’ll 
run, they’ll shoot and, perhaps 
most importantly, they’ll be 
fresh. With five guards with Big 
Ten starting experience and a 
potential weapon in Robinson, 
how could they not be?

They’ll play with poise and 

pace, too, in a way they never 
could have last season. The 
game moved too fast for the 
freshmen in 2014-15, Beilein 
has said. But ask Dawkins to 
list his single biggest offseason 
improvement, and he’ll tell 
you it’s his basketball IQ. Yet 
another break for Dawkins and 
the Wolverines: It’s harder to get 
smarter on the court if you’re 
never on the court.

LeVert’s absence in the second 

half of 2014-15 doesn’t just 
shape Michigan’s newfound 
depth — it also means LeVert 
is spending this season in Ann 
Arbor. He wasn’t supposed to be 
here for his senior season. He 
was supposed to be playing in 
the NBA alongside three of his 
recruiting class cohorts: Mitch 
McGary, Nik Stauskas and Glenn 
Robinson III. Instead, he’s back, 
he’s among the early favorites for 
Big Ten Player of the Year, and 
he’s ready to bring the program 
back to the state in which he 
found it. 

If 2014-15 was the year that 

never was, 2015-16 is the year 
that wasn’t supposed to be.

After a spate of injuries last 

season, after unfathomable 
losses to New Jersey Institute 
of Technology and Eastern 
Michigan, the Wolverines have 
reached the point that last year 
was supposed to represent. It’s 
time to show once and for all 
they’re a program that reloads 
and doesn’t rebuild.

After 2013’s Final Four run 

and 2014’s trip to the Elite Eight, 
Michigan had a chance to prove 
as a program that playing in late 
March is the expectation, not the 
exception. It became clear early 
on, even before LeVert’s injury, 
that it wasn’t meant to be, and 
the focus shifted.

Dawkins has called his 

unexpected opportunity for 
growth a “blessing in disguise.” 
Beilein has often discussed 
the team’s “growth mindset” 
in 2014-15. Redshirt freshman 
forward D.J. Wilson, out of 
commission for nearly the entire 
season, took advantage of the 
opportunity to hit the weight 

room. Sophomore forward Ricky 
Doyle joined him. Albrecht began 
the year as a backup point guard. 
By the season’s end, he was the 
team’s clear leader, its voice, its 
rallying point.

The Wolverines return 92.5 

percent of their scoring this 
season, the highest among 
teams currently ranked in the 
Associated Press Top 25. The 
pieces, improbably, are there.

This season isn’t what it 

was supposed to be — the year 
Michigan recovered from losing 
LeVert, the year its second-year 
guards grew into their own, the 
year the next segment of the 
John Beilein era took shape. All 
told, it’s tough to complain. The 
infantry is bigger and better, and 
the cavalry is coming.

This season is Michigan’s 

mulligan, but the green is shorter 
and they’re working with a better 
set of clubs. Don’t expect the 
Wolverines to miss twice.

Dame.

Spike made the varsity team 

at Crown Point High School his 
sophomore year and shined. In his 
sophomore season, they played 
Chesterton, which at the time 
had future Michigan teammate 
Mitch McGary. Purdue coach 
Matt Painter was in the stands 
to watch McGary, but Albrecht 
stole the show. Late in the game, 
after McGary was blocked, Spike 
took the ball the other way and 
finished with an and-1 play to 
help Crown Point win by four. He 
ended the game with 14 points 
and nine assists.

In retrospect, Painter said, not 

looking more closely at Albrecht 
was a mistake. In fact, Painter 
said he recruited his current 
point guard, 5-foot-10 sophomore 
P.J. Thompson, with Spike in 
mind. 

Painter wasn’t alone in passing 

on Spike.

During his senior season, 16 

Division-I coaches came to watch 
a 
game 
against 
Merrillville, 

interested only in Merrillville 
players — none came to watch 
Spike. Albrecht scored a game-
high 30 points and dished out five 
assists in a losing effort.

After the game, Crown Point’s 

athletic 
director 
told 
Chuck 

they’d be getting a lot of calls 
from coaches that were there.

Nobody called. Spike ended 

the 
season 
with 
conference 

MVP honors, 21 points per game 
and zero offers to play college 
basketball.

As his senior season came to an 

end, Albrecht was unsure about 
his future.

Notre Dame never bothered 

checking Spike out. He considered 
playing at Brown University, 
where Stephen played, but his 
ACT score was one point short of 
the school’s required mark. The 
coaches at Brown recommended 
he take a prep year at Northfield 
Mount Hermon (Mass.). There, he 
could play against some of the top 
high school talent in the country 
and work to get his test scores up. 
So he signed on with coach John 
Carroll and enrolled in NMH for 
a post-graduate year.

Over 
the 
summer, 
Wayne 

Brumm reached out to Spike. 
Brumm coached the SYF Players, 
one of the top AAU teams in the 
Midwest. He had coached both of 
Spike’s brothers, and with Spike 
opting for a prep year, he was 
eligible to play over the summer.

Brumm has an eye for talent. 

He also coached former Michigan 
players Glenn Robinson III, Max 
Bielfeldt and McGary, but even he 

admits that the first time he saw 
Spike play — in middle school — 
he wasn’t sure what to make of 
him.

“I was more amused than 

anything because he was really 
tiny, but he had game. He caught 
my eye, but I just — it was one of 
those reactions where you just 
sort of chuckle,” Brumm recalls.

At the Pittsburgh Jam Fest 

tournament, Brumm remembers 
one play perfectly. Spike dished 
a left-handed, half-court bounce 
pass to a teammate by the basket 
who finished with a layup. A 
friend of Brumm’s who is now a 
scout for the San Antonio Spurs 
came up to him at the end of the 
game and asked, “Who’s that kid? 
That kid’s got game.”

Spike played in just three 

tournaments 
with 
Brumm’s 

team before breaking his foot, 
but he left an impression on the 
longtime coach.

Spike left for NMH with the 

broken foot, leaving him unable 
to play during the fall period. In 
the fall, before the college season 
begins, college coaches have the 
opportunity to check out players 
in person. Dozens of coaches 
would come to open gyms at 
NMH, and all Spike could do was 
watch.

“I was just pissed,” he recalled. 

“I’m a thousand miles from home 
— I came there to play basketball, 
wanted to get a scholarship. I 
remember I was just getting so 
fed up.”

As fall turned to winter, 

though, Albrecht recovered, and 
was healthy in time for the start 
of the season. Just like his time 
at Crown Point, he turned heads. 
He was averaging nearly 10 
points and seven assists per game 
against some of the best talent 
in the country, but it still wasn’t 

good enough for to schools take a 
chance on him, and Albrecht had 
to reconsider his options for the 
following year.

Playing with Stephen at Brown 

was out of the picture. Despite his 
best efforts, he couldn’t manage 
the ACT score.

So, midway through the year 

at NMH, father and son had a 
candid conversation.

“I’m like, ‘I don’t want to 

play Division II or Division III 
basketball’ — nothing against it 
— that’s just not what I worked 

for,” Albrecht recalled. “So I 
remember thinking, ‘Shit, I guess 
I’m just going to go to IU for 
school.’ ”

That was the plan. He’d give up 

basketball, go to Indiana, study 
business and be a “rec-league 
superstar.”

Then a phone call came.
“All of a sudden my prep school 

coach comes up to me and he’s 
like, ‘Hey I got an interesting call 
today,’ ” Spike remembers.

It was Michigan.
“I was like, ‘The University

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

coach John Beilein wasn’t always 
so sure about Spike Albrecht. 

Beilein says that when he 

offered the 5-foot-11 guard a 
scholarship, he knew it would 
either be one of his best decisions 
as Michigan’s coach, or one of his 
last.

After watching Albrecht play 

in an open gym on campus during 
his recruiting trip, Beilein invited 
him and his parents over to his 
house for dinner. Following the 
meal, he took them into his home 
office.

“I was kind of intimidated, 

like, ‘Oh shit,’ ” Albrecht recalled 
thinking. “He was sitting there 
talking, then he paused. I could 
tell he was thinking, about ready 
to make a big decision. He’s like, 
‘You’re either going to get me fired 
or make me look like a genius.’ 
And then he goes, ‘How would 
you like to come play basketball at 
Michigan?’ ”

Spike accepted on the spot.
Beilein did what no one else 

was willing to — take a shot on the 
little guy. Spike didn’t look like a 
Division I athlete, much less a 
basketball player. He had only 
one other offer to play, and an 

Ivy League opportunity that fell 
through when he failed to bump 
his ACT score up a point.

It was one point he’s glad he 

never got.

* * *

Spike’s first neighbors adored 

him.

When he was just 3 years 

old, the neighbors would bring 
company over and Albrecht’s dad 
to pitch to him. The neighbors 
wanted to show their guests how 
far Spike could hit a baseball — 
over the roof sometimes — even 
at just 3.

Then his family moved, not 

too far away, to a different house 
in Crown Point, Ind. The new 
neighbors weren’t as excited 
about having a rambunctious 
little Albrecht running around.

“I was the youngest brother, 

so I always wanted to be causing 
havoc, trying to get away with 
things,” Spike said. “There are a 
lot of good stories.”

Like the time he upset his 

“crazy neighbor” Betty when he 
hit a ball onto her roof, and she 
stormed over to tell his father.

Or the time the 10-year-old 

and his friends stole a page from 
Billy Madison and put a bag of dog 
poop on a neighbor’s porch, rang 
the doorbell and ran.

“We didn’t actually light it on 

fire,” he said. “We picked it up 
with a shovel, put it in a bag.”

There was the day he stole 

$140 from his parents’ cupboard 
in grade school and announced 
to the whole class that he was 
buying ice cream for them at 
lunch.

Or the time he hit golf balls 

across a busy street as a kid.

“He just didn’t care,” said 

Stephen Albrecht, one of Spike’s 
older 
brothers, 
about 
Spike 

growing up. “Looking back on 
it at the time, there might (have 
been) something wrong with this 
kid.”

* * *

Spike was born in Crown Point, 

a small suburb 50 miles south of 
Chicago. He was the third of 
four children born to Chuck and 
Tammy Albrecht. There was 
Chachi, six years older; Stephen, 
three years Spike’s senior; and 
then Spike, followed by the lone 
girl, Hannah.

As a youngster, if Chachi and 

Stephen did it, Spike wanted to, 
too. Stephen and his friends used 
to egg Spike on to curse. They 
thought it was funny to hear a 
four-letter word fly out of the 
mouth of a 4-year-old, and Spike 
would oblige.

On the court, too, Spike wanted 

to be with his brothers. When 
Chuck coached Chachi’s 9-year-
old team, Spike, just three years 
old at the time, would tag along.

When those closest to him are 

asked when they first knew he 
had a knack for the game, they all 
tell the same story.

It was in a youth-league game 

when he was in first grade and 
Stephen was in fourth grade. 
Stephen’s team was playing a 
team 
from 
Chesterton, 
Ind., 

that 
former 
Michigan 
guard 

and Albrecht family friend Zack 
Novak played on.

Leading big late, Stephen’s 

team put Spike in at the end of 
the game. He got the ball, crossed 
over his defender and scored.

“We give him crap to this day,” 

Novak said of Spike’s defender.

With two brothers showing 

him the ropes, Spike caught on 
quickly.

He could swat a baseball, 

launch a football and pass a 
basketball like nobody’s business 
at a young age. He picked up 
everything 
easily. 
He 
never 

learned to ride a bike; he just got 
on it one day and was gone.

“I was looking for the training 

wheels,” Chuck recalled. “And 
my dad was here, and he goes, 
‘What are you doing?’ And I go, 
‘I’m looking for those training 
wheels.’ He goes, ‘Spike’s already 
riding the bike.’ Just gone. He was 
down the street.”

Playing 
against 
older 

competition his whole life set 
Albrecht up well. He turned heads 
on the hardwood and wowed 
spectators on the diamond. Spike, 
whose given name is Michael, got 
his nickname because he never 
took his baseball cleats off when 
he was younger — even when he 
went to church. But before high 
school, he decided to hang up his 
cleats for good. Baseball was too 
slow and bored him. He opted 
to exclusively pursue basketball 
and had his sight set on playing

of Michigan?’ I was in complete 
shock and I honestly thought — I 
thought he was messing with me.”

* * *

Back home, Brumm had been 

pounding the phones on Spike’s 
behalf, reaching out to college 
coaches. Brumm and Michigan 
assistant coach Jeff Meyer are 
longtime friends, and when Meyer 
mentioned 
Michigan 
needed 

a point guard because then-
freshman guard Trey Burke might 
take off for the NBA, Brumm 
didn’t hesitate to recommend 
Spike.

“I 
felt 
Spike 
could 
play 

anywhere all along,” Brumm said. 
“But convincing (college coaches) 
is a different story.”

Luckily 
for 
Spike, 
Meyer 

trusted Brumm’s word and came 
out to watch him play.

In a game against Hargrave 

Military Academy, with Meyer 
in the crowd, Spike put up nine 
points and tallied 14 assists. He 
was worried it wasn’t enough to 
impress the coach. 

After 
the 
game, 
Spike 

remembers 
thinking, 
“Damn, 

did I just miss my chance with 
Michigan?” 

The next day, Beilein called. 

He’d had his eye on Spike from a 
distance and loved what he saw.

Beilein was impressed with 

his play, so much so that he 
personally cut film of Spike — 
some 300 clips, he says — the 
most he has ever scrutinized 

a recruit on video. Perhaps, in 
Spike, Beilein saw himself: an 
undersized, 
under-recruited 

guard with good handles. Beilein 
played at Wheeling College — a 
small Division-II school — and 
spent most of his time there on the 
bench.

Despite Meyer’s report, Beilein 

still wasn’t sure. Back on campus 
one day in the spring of 2012, 
Beilein 
called 
then-Michigan 

junior Josh Bartelstein into his 
office and showed him film of 
Spike.

“ ‘I want you to watch film with 

me for five minutes and tell me if 
I’m crazy or if this kid’s actually 
good,’ ” Bartelstein remembers 
Beilein telling him. “ ‘He’s got no 
other offers. People aren’t gonna 
offer him. People are gonna think 
I’m nuts, but I’m telling you, I see 
something in him.’ ”

Bartelstein 
watched 
with 

Beilein, and could tell his coach 
was high on the little guy.

Beilein wanted to see for 

himself. He met Spike in Crown 
Point for an in-home visit. He 
pulled onto the sloped driveway 
and Albrecht was standing at the 
bottom.

“His coach told me he’s not 

going to pass the eye test,” Beilein 
recalls. “I was standing above 
him, and he was below me, and I’m 
looking, towering over him, and 
I’m saying to myself, ‘No kidding, 
he’s not passing this first eye test 
at all.’ ”

The coach and player met 

and talked about the potential 

opportunity 
of 
playing 
at 

Michigan. Beilein still hadn’t seen 
him play in person, though, so he 
later traveled to NMH to watch 
him play in an open gym.

Beilein, 
along 
with 
other 

college coaches, including some 
from Appalachian State, which 
had recently extended an offer 
to Spike, watched him play pick-
up in an open gym. Spike played 
seven games and never lost.

Looking back on it, that was 

hardly coincidence.

“We kind of set the teams up in 

my favor,” Albrecht said.

Regardless, 

Beilein 
was 

sold. He decided 
right then that 
he 
was 
going 

to offer Spike 
a 
scholarship, 

though he didn’t 
tell him that at 
the time.

One 
week 

later, 
Spike 

was set to visit 
campus. At the airport, when he 
told a TSA agent why he was going 
to Michigan, the airport employee 
didn’t believe him.

“He’s like ‘Michigan? Get the 

hell out of here,’ ” Albrecht said. 
“And he screams over to his friend 
Big Mike, ‘Yo, Big Mike. This 
little white boy says he’s going to 
Michigan.’ ”

Doubters aplenty, Spike took off 

for Ann Arbor.

* * *

On his campus visit, Spike 

wanted 
to 
make 
a 
good 

impression, 
and 
Beilein 
was 

looking out for him.

The story goes that Spike, 

Beilein, then-sophomore forward 
Jon Horford and some of the 
assistant coaches were out to 
lunch at The Chop House. After 
eating, the coaches insisted Spike 
get dessert. He didn’t want to, but 
they said they needed to beef him 
up.

“He tried to order tiramisu 

and he asked what was in it,” 
Horford remembers. “I told 
him there was a little alcohol 
in it, and Coach Beilein freaked 
out like, ‘No, no, no you can’t 
have anything with alcohol in it. 
That’s not responsible of me.’ He 
made a big deal of it.”

Later that day, Beilein had 

others keep an eye on Spike for 
him — this time in a players-only 
open gym. Due to NCAA rules, 
coaches cannot watch open gyms 
that are not mandated tryouts.

Spike held his own, and after 

the practice, Beilein asked some 
of the players what they thought: 
Was Spike walk-on talent or a 
scholarship player?

“Everyone was like, ‘Oh yeah, 

he’s a great kid; he’s really nice; 
he’s a pretty good basketball 
player,’ ” Horford said. “But 
literally, I was the only one who 
said that I thought he should be on 
a scholarship, and I didn’t know 
that until (Michigan assistant 
coach Bacari Alexander) told me 
later. He’s like, ‘You know, you 
were the only one.’ ”

Bartelstein 

and 
former 

Michigan 
player 
Matt 

Vogrich 
claim 

that they, too, 
recommended 
Spike 
for 

scholarship, 
perhaps 
less 

vocally. 
The 

exact 
number 

is unclear, but 

what is clear is that not all of his 
future teammates thought he 
had the makings of a scholarship 
player at the time.

The next day, Beilein made 

his decision final. He would 
offer Spike a scholarship. And so 
the unlikely marriage between 
Michigan and Albrecht began.

* * *

Twelve minutes, 17 points and 

one tweet. That’s what it took for 

Spike to go from unrecognized to 
can’t-be-missed.

Spike flew under the radar for 

most of his freshman year. During 
one game at Ohio State, he was late 
coming off the bus. When he tried 
to catch up with his teammates, a 
security guard stopped him and 
told him, “Players only.”

He played in garbage time 

and whenever Burke needed a 
breather.

He knew his role. Beilein had 

made it clear: He’d back up Burke, 
and the following year, when 
another guard named Derrick 
Walton Jr. arrived, Spike would 
likely back him up, too. That was 
OK with Spike. He remembered 
what his dad used to tell him: 
“Not everyone can be a superstar, 
but everyone can be a superstar in 
their own role.”

But on that Monday night in 

Atlanta, on the biggest stage, in 
the 2013 National Championship 
Game against Louisville, Spike 
was the superstar.

Burke committed two fouls 

early in the first half. Beilein took 
him out, and Spike went in. He 
knocked down his first five field-
goal attempts, pushing Michigan 
out to a 12-point lead. The magic 
ended, though, as Michigan’s 
lead, and championship hopes, 
slipped away. But nobody forgot 
the night Spike had.

His 
performance 
shocked 

everyone except those who knew 
him.

“When that all happened, I was 

like, ‘This is what he did in high 
school,’ ” former Crown Point 
teammate and best friend Evan 
Langbehn recalled thinking. “I 
wouldn’t say I was shocked. … 
You always knew that he thrived 
in the big moment.”

His former coach at Crown 

Point, Clint Swan was at the game 
and couldn’t hold in his emotion.

“For him to overcome so 

many doubters and not just get a 
Division I scholarship, but to get a 
Big Ten scholarship, and not just 
to get a Big Ten scholarship but 
to contribute his freshman year, 
and not just to contribute but to 
make the All-Final Four team. 
It was almost more than I could 
overcome.”

The day after the loss, Spike 

and 
some 
teammates 
were 

talking. One of them — Spike 
forgets who, but denies it was 
him — threw out the idea that he 
tweet at supermodel Kate Upton, 
who was at the game the night 
before.

Spike didn’t love the idea.

junior Josh Bartelstein into his 
office and showed him film of 
Spike.

“ ‘I want you to watch film with 

me for five minutes and tell me if 
I’m crazy or if this kid’s actually 
good,’ ” Bartelstein remembers 
Beilein telling him. “ ‘He’s got no 
other offers. People aren’t gonna 
offer him. People are gonna think 
I’m nuts, but I’m telling you, I see 
something in him.’ ”

Bartelstein 
watched 
with 

Beilein, and could tell his coach 
was high on the little guy.

Beilein wanted to see for 

himself. He met Spike in Crown 
Point for an in-home visit. He 
pulled onto the sloped driveway 
and Albrecht was standing at the 
bottom.

“His coach told me he’s not 

going to pass the eye test,” Beilein 
recalls. “I was standing above 
him, and he was below me, and I’m 
looking, towering over him, and 
I’m saying to myself, ‘No kidding, 
he’s not passing this first eye test 
at all.’ ”

The coach and player met 

and talked about the potential 

opportunity 
of 
playing 
at 

Michigan. Beilein still hadn’t seen 
him play in person, though, so he 
later traveled to NMH to watch 
him play in an open gym.

Beilein, 
along 
with 
other 

college coaches, including some 
from Appalachian State, which 
had recently extended an offer 
to Spike, watched him play pick-
up in an open gym. Spike played 
seven games and never lost.

Looking back on it, that was 

hardly coincidence.

“We kind of set the teams up in 

my favor,” Albrecht said.

Regardless, 

Beilein 
was 

sold. He decided 
right then that 
he 
was 
going 

to offer Spike 
a 
scholarship, 

though he didn’t 
tell him that at 
the time.

One 
week 

later, 
Spike 

was set to visit 
campus. At the airport, when he 
told a TSA agent why he was going 
to Michigan, the airport employee 
didn’t believe him.

“He’s like ‘Michigan? Get the 

hell out of here,’ ” Albrecht said. 
“And he screams over to his friend 
Big Mike, ‘Yo, Big Mike. This 
little white boy says he’s going to 
Michigan.’ ”

Doubters aplenty, Spike took off 

for Ann Arbor.

* * *

On his campus visit, Spike 

wanted 
to 
make 
a 
good 

impression, 
and 
Beilein 
was 

looking out for him.

The story goes that Spike, 

Beilein, then-sophomore forward 
Jon Horford and some of the 
assistant coaches were out to 
lunch at The Chop House. After 
eating, the coaches insisted Spike 
get dessert. He didn’t want to, but 
they said they needed to beef him 
up.

“He tried to order tiramisu 

and he asked what was in it,” 
Horford remembers. “I told 
him there was a little alcohol 
in it, and Coach Beilein freaked 
out like, ‘No, no, no you can’t 
have anything with alcohol in it. 
That’s not responsible of me.’ He 
made a big deal of it.”

Later that day, Beilein had 

others keep an eye on Spike for 
him — this time in a players-only 
open gym. Due to NCAA rules, 
coaches cannot watch open gyms 
that are not mandated tryouts.

Spike held his own, and after 

the practice, Beilein asked some 
of the players what they thought: 
Was Spike walk-on talent or a 
scholarship player?

“Everyone was like, ‘Oh yeah, 

he’s a great kid; he’s really nice; 
he’s a pretty good basketball 
player,’ ” Horford said. “But 
literally, I was the only one who 
said that I thought he should be on 
a scholarship, and I didn’t know 
that until (Michigan assistant 
coach Bacari Alexander) told me 
later. He’s like, ‘You know, you 
were the only one.’ ”

Bartelstein 

and 
former 

Michigan 
player 
Matt 

Vogrich 
claim 

that they, too, 
recommended 
Spike 
for 

scholarship, 
perhaps 
less 

vocally. 
The 

exact 
number 

is unclear, but 

what is clear is that not all of his 
future teammates thought he 
had the makings of a scholarship 
player at the time.

The next day, Beilein made 

his decision final. He would 
offer Spike a scholarship. And so 
the unlikely marriage between 
Michigan and Albrecht began.

* * *

Twelve minutes, 17 points and 

one tweet. That’s what it took for 

Spike to go from unrecognized to 
can’t-be-missed.

Spike flew under the radar for 

most of his freshman year. During 
one game at Ohio State, he was late 
coming off the bus. When he tried 
to catch up with his teammates, a 
security guard stopped him and 
told him, “Players only.”

He played in garbage time 

and whenever Burke needed a 
breather.

He knew his role. Beilein had 

made it clear: He’d back up Burke, 
and the following year, when 
another guard named Derrick 
Walton Jr. arrived, Spike would 
likely back him up, too. That was 
OK with Spike. He remembered 
what his dad used to tell him: 
“Not everyone can be a superstar, 
but everyone can be a superstar in 
their own role.”

But on that Monday night in 

Atlanta, on the biggest stage, in 
the 2013 National Championship 
Game against Louisville, Spike 
was the superstar.

Burke committed two fouls 

early in the first half. Beilein took 
him out, and Spike went in. He 
knocked down his first five field-
goal attempts, pushing Michigan 
out to a 12-point lead. The magic 
ended, though, as Michigan’s 
lead, and championship hopes, 
slipped away. But nobody forgot 
the night Spike had.

His 
performance 
shocked 

everyone except those who knew 
him.

“When that all happened, I was 

like, ‘This is what he did in high 
school,’ ” former Crown Point 
teammate and best friend Evan 
Langbehn recalled thinking. “I 
wouldn’t say I was shocked. … 
You always knew that he thrived 
in the big moment.”

His former coach at Crown 

Point, Clint Swan was at the game 
and couldn’t hold in his emotion.

“For him to overcome so 

many doubters and not just get a 
Division I scholarship, but to get a 
Big Ten scholarship, and not just 
to get a Big Ten scholarship but 
to contribute his freshman year, 
and not just to contribute but to 
make the All-Final Four team. 
It was almost more than I could 
overcome.”

The day after the loss, Spike 

and 
some 
teammates 
were 

talking. One of them — Spike 
forgets who, but denies it was 
him — threw out the idea that he 
tweet at supermodel Kate Upton, 
who was at the game the night 
before.

Spike didn’t love the idea.

this first eye test 

at all.”

COURTESY OF THE ALBRECHT FAMILY

Spike Albrecht earned his nickname through baseball, because he never took his cleats off when he was younger.

“I don’t want the coaches to be 

pissed at me or people to think 
that I don’t care that we just lost 
the national championship,” Spike 
remembered thinking. “Because 
obviously I would have traded 
all that in to have not played and 
won the national championship, 
that’s what mattered to me.”

He checked with Bartelstein, 

and the captain gave him the 
OK. He pressed send and within 
minutes his phone was exploding.

@KateUpton hey saw you at the 

game last night, thanks for coming 
out! Hope to see you again ;-)

“I remember frickin three days 

straight my phone was just non-
stop,” Albrecht said. “I remember 
after the first couple of minutes, 
me and (former Michigan player) 
Nik (Stauskas) were sitting in 
a room and we were laughing. 
Stausky, he was going nuts and 
I was like, ‘Dude, I don’t think I 
should’ve done it. This has gotten 
to be real bad.’ It was just getting 
stupid.”

Bartelstein saw Spike’s status 

— not his ego — blow up. On 
campus, he was an overnight 
celebrity. The departing senior 
didn’t want that one game to be 
Spike’s only legacy.

“Don’t let that half define the 

rest of your career,” Bartelstein 
told Spike afterward. “Don’t let 
that be the end of it.”

Spike listened. His sophomore 

year, he helped Michigan to its 
first outright Big Ten title in 
28 years. The year after, he was 
named a co-captain and played 
major minutes with two bad hips 
when other teammates suffered 
season-ending injuries. This year, 
he is on track to become one of the 

winningest players in program 
history. Not bad for a guy pegged 
as a career backup.

* * *

It’s the Friday night before the 

Michigan football team’s game 
against Brigham Young and Spike 
Albrecht — like dozens of other 
Michigan seniors — is in a corner 
by the bar at Rick’s American Café.

On the opposite side of the 

basement bar, former Yankees 
captain Derek Jeter is sitting at a 
booth with some friends. Jeter sits 
in a roped-off area, and dozens 
of Snapchatting students hover 
around to get a shot of the Yankees 
legend at their favorite campus 
hangout.

Back on the other side, Albrecht 

and Caris LeVert — Michigan’s 
co-captains — pose for a picture 
with two giddy girls.

Spike 
and 
some 
other 

teammates eventually sneak their 
way over toward Jeter, and the 
future Hall-of-Famer calls him 
over. Michigan’s co-captain and 
Captain Clutch meet and pose for 
a quick picture with some others.

Just 
a 
couple 
of 
captains 

hanging out.

“Stunningly, 
he 
knew 
who 

we were, so that was probably 
the highlight of my weekend,” 
Albrecht said.

Asked 
if 
he 
was 
actually 

surprised Jeter knew him — one 
of the faces of Michigan athletics, 
someone who dropped 17 points in 
a national championship game — 
Spike didn’t hesitate.

“Hell yeah, that does surprise 

me. I was shocked that he called 
my name before I even introduced 

myself. I thought that was pretty 
cool.”

He’s still not used to the 

attention. He never will be.

* * *

Two weeks before the season 

started, 
Michigan 
hosted 
an 

open practice followed by an 
opportunity for fans to take 
photos with the players.

The line for Spike was twice 

as long as the 
line 
for 
any 

other 
player, 

and for an hour, 
he smiled and 
posed as they 
snapped.

Colin 

Williams, 
6, 

went to Spike’s 
line 
first. 

Dressed in his 
No. 
2 
jersey, 

he said that Spike is his favorite 
player.

His dad, David Williams, says 

Spike’s a natural draw for his son. 
“They see Spike, and they say, 
‘Hey, he’s not much taller than me. 
I can play just like him.’ ”

Spike has heard that his whole 

life.

“The things I do, I feel like a 

lot of people can do,” Albrecht 
said. “You don’t have to be a freak 
athlete or 6-(foot)-5 to do a lot 
of the things I do out there. So 
I think that’s part of the reason 
people can relate to me.”

Standing next to him, it looks 

like that. The 5-foot-11 guard isn’t 
that big. That could be anyone. But 
the reality is, most people haven’t 
put in the work to do the things he 

does.

“He reminds me of that swan 

that looks so graceful out there 
on the water,” Brumm says. “But 
under water, he’s swimming like 
heck.”

Perhaps Bartelstein summed 

up people’s natural attraction to 
Spike the best: “The legend of 
Spike Albrecht is that any kid can 
be him if you work hard at it.”

* * *

It’s 10 days 

before Michigan 
tips off against 
Northern 
Michigan, 
and 

Spike 
sits 
in 

the 
lobby 
of 

the 
William 

Davidson Player 
Development 
Center, his back 
to a rare sunny 

November day in Ann Arbor.

He’s relaxed. He tells stories 

about driveway hoops, swears that 
he’s the best ping-pong player on 
the team and says that he hopes 
that, in the future, he’s “making a 
lot of money.”

Three of the five members of 

his freshman class are on NBA 
rosters; Caris LeVert, the fourth, 
is poised to join them next year. 
Spike couldn’t be happier for 
them. In fact, he says he knew 
from the first time he played with 
them that they’d all go pro.

“I don’t get jealous,” Albrecht 

said. “It doesn’t make me mad or 
anything like that. They’re all 
great kids. Some of my closest 
friends who’ve worked their tails 
off to be in the positions they’re in, 

and I feel like I’ve done OK with 
what I am or what I got.

“You don’t see many guys 

like me playing in the NBA. You 
don’t even see many guys like me 
playing college basketball. So I’ve 
always been realistic with myself. 
I have tons of confidence in myself 
and I don’t doubt my ability, but 
those dudes, you watch the NBA 
at all? You see what those guys do. 
It’s a whole different animal.”

He hasn’t ruled out playing 

overseas next year, but he doesn’t 
try to think about the future too 
much.

“It just seems crazy that I’ve 

put in 20 years of work and 
busted my ass for this game, given 
everything I got, and then it’s just 
all gone,” he said. “So that’s going 
to be tough for me. … I’m sure if 
you ask anyone, it’s tough giving 
up what you love to do and what 
you’ve worked so hard at for so 
long.”

Maybe he’ll play overseas for a 

few years. Maybe not. As for his 
future, no one’s totally sure yet.

Vogrich jokes that he’ll work at 

Abercrombie and Fitch. His dad 
thinks he’ll make a career out of 
his people skills. He used to chat 
up so many people during his 
Little League days that they said 
he’d become the mayor one day.

But enough about what’s next 

for Spike — he wants to talk about 
his coach’s future.

Earlier in the day, Michigan 

announced 
it 
had 
extended 

Beilein’s contract through 2020-
21, and Spike jokes that Beilein 
offering him a scholarship didn’t 
get the coach fired after all.

It got him an extension and a 

raise.

Wolverines deep at every position

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan men’s basketball coach 

John Beilein has a lot of options at 
guard. Well, he has a lot of forwards, 
too. This team has no shortage of 
depth. 

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, though, it’s going to 
be difficult to figure out who goes 
where.

 “It’s like, one day somebody 

looks like a million bucks and the 
other guy doesn’t look (as good), 
and then they just switch spots the 
next day,” Beilein said. “Sometimes, 
(having) 
too 
many 
(players) 

makes it more difficult. If there 
was a bunch of veterans and a few 
freshmen, that could distinguish 
who plays because the freshmen are 
so far down the line. But that’s not 
the issue right now.”

 Coming off of a 16-16 season in 

which the Wolverines went 8-10 
in the Big Ten, No. 25 Michigan 
is looking to make a splash after 
failing to make the tournament less 
than a year ago. 

 If all goes to plan, and that’s a big 

“if” considering the injury-plagued 
roster of 2014-15, then Michigan 
will finally have a chance to display 
the talent on its roster. 

 

Point Guard

 
After a toe injury from late 

November caught up to Derrick 
Walton Jr. in January, the then-
sophomore was sidelined for the 
rest of the season. Now, the 6-foot-1 
junior is back, and emphatically so: 
against Le Moyne, he shot 5-for-6 
for 13 points in the 20 minutes that 

he played. 

Though Walton will start for the 

Wolverines, it would be unfair to 
forget about senior Spike Albrecht. 
The 5-foot-11 captain took the reins 
in early 2015, shooting 40.4 percent 
from the field and playing 30-plus 
minutes in 18 games. 

 Having Albrecht is essential 

to Michigan’s roster, and the 
experienced combination of Walton 
and Albrecht will be hard to stop 
in Beilein’s two-guard offense. For 
now, Albrecht is still recovering 
from his offseason hip injuries, but 
you can expect a great deal from 
his senior season. Beilein doesn’t 
expect Albrecht to be at full force 
for a few weeks, at least, but he will 
be playing spot minutes until then. 

Behind Albrecht and Walton is 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman, 
who will have to fight for minutes 
after playing plenty last season in 
the wake of injuries to the starting 
backcourt. The 6-foot-4 sophomore 
had four double-digit scoring games 
last season and averaged 19 minutes 
per game. Against Le Moyne, he 
went scoreless and played just 12 
minutes.

 

Guard/Forward

 
Caris LeVert is finally back after 

breaking his foot in the beginning 
of the 2014-15 season. Against Le 
Moyne, the 6-foot-7 senior showed 
exactly why he could have left 
Michigan for the NBA, scoring a 
team-high 22 points and shooting 
4-for-9 from beyond the arc. LeVert 
is obviously a lock at the shooting 
guard position. 

Multiple players could see time at 

the small forward position during 

the beginning of the season. Against 
Le Moyne, 6-foot-6 sophomore 
Aubrey Dawkins started but failed 
to impress, shooting just 1-for-11 
from the field. Dawkins was given 
a chance after having a breakout 
freshman season that included 
a career-best 31 points against 
Rutgers in March. 

 Adding even more depth is 

redshirt 
sophomore 
Duncan 

Robinson, who already appears 
to be a fan favorite as a Cinderella 
story from Division III Williams 
College. The lean, 6-foot-8, 210 
pound Robinson doesn’t hesitate 
before throwing up 3-pointers, 
attempting (and sinking) his first 
shot as a Wolverine from beyond 
the arc just a minute after getting 
on the court. 

 

Forward/Center

 
Zak Irvin is still recovering 

from an offseason back surgery. 
According to Beilein, the junior 
has been given the green light to 
play but won’t against Northern 

Michigan on Friday. Beilein is 
waiting for the 6-foot-6 junior to 
give him the go-ahead. Irvin was 
the only Wolverine to start in all 32 
games last season, averaging 14.3 
points per game and 4.8 rebounds. 

Kam 
Chatman 
had 
a 

disappointing 
freshman 
season 

after losing his place in the starting 
lineup, but he has been repeatedly 
commended for his work ethic this 
offseason. The 6-foot-8 sophomore 
started in place of Irvin during 
exhibition but didn’t make much of 
an impact. He’s looked good in other 
preseason practices, however, and if 
he lives up to his coaches’ hype, he’ll 
be in competition for a starting job. 

Freshman Moritz Wagner has 

gotten almost as much attention 
as Robinson this preseason, even 
if it’s mainly because of his accent. 
The lanky, 6-foot-10 German has 
put on nearly 20 pounds of muscle 
this summer, but he still might take 
a redshirt this season. A year of 
conditioning for Wagner could be 
beneficial for the Wolverines, but 
Beilein insists that Wagner will 

earn playing time if he continues to 
perform like he has in practice. 

 After starting 19 games during his 

freshman year at center, Ricky Doyle 
started the exhibition on the bench 
behind junior Mark Donnal. The two 
6-foot-9 big men have been battling it 
out all summer, and Donnal appears 
to have won this round. Doyle is still 
stronger than Donnal, however, and 
has a reputation for his dunks and 
defense. It would surprise most if 
Donnal actually starts for most of the 
season after losing the job last year. 

Redshirt freshman D.J. Wilson 

will need to find his place on the 
court if he wants minutes this 
season, but there’s a decent chance 
he’ll be fighting for time at both 
stretch forward and center. Beilein 
has credited Wilson with picking up 
things at both positions quickly, but 
admits it’s much easier to perform 
when you only have to know one. 
The redshirt freshman has added 
25 pounds of muscle in the past 
year, and is a threat at 6-foot-10. 
Wilson will most likely get the bulk 
of his time backing up the big men. 

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Junior guard Derrick Walton Jr. is healthy again after an injury-riddled 2014-15 season and will run the point for the Wolverines.
