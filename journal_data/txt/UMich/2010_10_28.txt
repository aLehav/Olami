UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
UGLi lobby to become less so

Renovations slated
to be completed in
Feb. will transform
lobby into lounge
By MALLORY BEBERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The Shapiro Undergradu-
ate Library may, in part, lose its
aesthetic namesake in the com-
ing months. This past Tuesday
marked the start of construction
for the UGLi's new updated lobby.
The lobby, which will show-
case new technology and seating
options, is slated become a study
lounge for students in the winter.

Laurie Alexander, the direc-
tor of the Shapiro Undergraduate
Library, said the project has been
discussed ever since the addition
of Bert's Cafe to the lobby in Janu-
ary of 2008.
"It's a natural progression to
think about the rest of the lobby,"
she said.
Alexander said the new lobby
is designed to be more open and
inviting, adding that clusters of
chairs, tables and sofas will sur-
round the circulation desk, which
will be located in the center of
the area. She said she hopes that
as students become comfortable
working in the lobby, they will
move the furniture around to bet-
ter suit their needs.
Alexander added that there

would be large television screens
situated around the room that stu-
dents will be able to plug their lap-
tops into when working on group
projects and other sorts of assign-
ments.
"When you look at the space
you'll see it really promotes col-
laboration and connection and the
technology will support the work
that students are already doing,"
she said.
Alexander added that the
screens would be "a wonderful
opportunity" to display student art
installations, films or PowerPoint
presentations. In addition, the
screens will show international
news feeds.

Though most walk in the door

Sava's was issued its liquor

it does provide the chance to host

r GOP candidates planning
and hoping for 2012 success

Hank Choate, co-owner of Choate's Belly Acres farm, introduces Republican candidate for governor Rick Snyder after the pair
toured the farm in Liberty Township near Jackson, Mich. yesterday.
Snyder, Bernro declare
plan for diverseI cabinets

Mich. gubernatorial
candidates promise
to pick bipartisan
cabinet if elected
LANSING, Mich. (AP)- Wheth-
er voters pick Democrat Virg Ber-
nero or Republican Rick Snyder
as Michigan's next governor, the
state's new department heads will
likely be a diverse group.
Bernero said Wednesday that
he kept a mix of Republicans and
Democrats on board when he
became Lansing mayor five years
ago and likely would do that as gov-
ernor if he wins Nov. 2. And both
he and Snyder said they will name
a cabinet that represents a wide
spectrum of viewpoints.
"We want a cabinet that looks
like the state of Michigan and it
will," Bernero told The Associated
Press in a Wednesday phone inter-
view between campaign appear-
ances. He added that he'd appoint
"the best and the brightest."
Snyder also said he'll choose his
cabinet based more on merit than
political affiliation, and expects to
have some Democrats in the mix.
"We'll look for a broad back-

ground in terms of all the diver-
sity criteria, with gender, ethnic
groups, to get a wide representa-
tion. Because I view that as a posi-
tive," he said earlier this week after
campaigning at a Jackson County
dairy farm.
The official governor's residence
in Lansing could remain unoc-
cupied during the next admin-
istration. Snyder, who lives in a
gated community in Washtenaw
County's Superior Township and
has a large vacation home on Gun
Lake near Hastings, said he won't
live in Lansing until his young-
est daughter graduates from high
school. She just started ninth grade
at Greenhills Academy, a small pri-
vate school in Ann Arbor for grades
6-12. Snyder also has two older
children.
The Ann Arbor businessman
said he'd like to investigate rent-
ing out the 8,700-square-foot gov-
ernor's residence, located in an
upscale Lansing neighborhood, for
various events.
The residence, which under-
went a $2.5 million addition and
improvements in 2003, now has
five bedrooms, a private family
room that includes a kitchenette,
a fully commercial kitchen, a large
dining room and a sunken living

room that looks out on extensive
flower gardens and a vegetable
and herb garden used by the resi-
dence's current chef. Gov. Jennifer
Granholm, her husband and three
children moved into the residence
in 2003.
"Is there a way we can leverage
the residence in a positive way for
people to do events there, other
things that would be worthwhile?"
Snyder asked. "Again, I'm a cost-
efficient guy. How can we get value
for money?"
Bernero, who lives in a more
modest house a couple blocks away
from the governor's residence,
said he hasn't thought yet about
whether he'd move there if elected.
His wife, Teri, is the principal at
an elementary school in the neigh-
borhood and plans to keep that job
whether he's mayor or governor on
Jan. 1. The couple's two daughters
are out of high school.
Both candidates concentrated
their efforts Wednesday on cam-
paigning in west Michigan.
Snyder held afternoon campaign
rallies in Holland and Muskegon,
while Bernero stopped at a Battle
Creek coffee shop to greet voters
before holding rallies in Benton
Harbor, Muskegon and Grand Rap-
ids.

Republicans look to
gain political ground
closer to elections
WASHINGTON (AP) - Get
ready for the big tease.
Republicans positioning for a
possible presidential run are, to
varying degrees, courting donors,
testing messages and plotting
strategies. They're visiting early
primary states, wooing key activ-
ists and, all the while, stirring
interest as they gauge whether to
launch full-fledged campaigns.
"We can see 2012 from our
house," Sarah Palin quipped
recently, setting off another round
of will-she-or-won't-she specula-
tion.
But even though Nov. 3 is the
unofficial start of the 2012 cam-
paign, don't expect a surge of
Republicans to declare their inten-
tions anytime soon.
From Mitt Romney to Tim
Pawlenty, few if any GOP aspirants
plan to officially get into the race -
or formally bow out of it - before
year's end. And many, like Newt
Gingrich and Haley Barbour, are
expected to wait even longer -
spring or beyond - to announce
whether they will launch candi-
dacies for the chance to challenge
President Barack Obama in his
likely re-election race.
It's a sharp contrast to the last
presidential race, when Republi-
cans and Democrats alike jumped
in just days after the 2006 midterm
elections, a flurry of activity kick-
ing off a frenetic two-year sprint
that ended with Obama's election.
Not this year.
There's a general consensus in
Washington - and among Repub-
licans close to the potential candi-
dates - that the last White House
race started too soon and cost too
much.
By delaying disclosure of their
plans, prospective candidates will
have more time to build campaign
organizations withoutthe scrutiny
that comes with being a declared
entrant. They also put off the enor-
mous expense that comes with
launching a presidential operation
more than a year before the GOP
presidential nomination contests

start with the Iowa caucuses in
February 2012.
Uncertainty is a huge factor,
too, as Republicans make up their
minds about whether the climate
is right..
No one knows whether the tea
party that wreaked havoc on GOP
primaries will be a force beyond
the Nov. 2 elections. Or whether
Obama's popularity will stay mired
under 50 percent. Or whether
unemployment will still hover
near 10 percent. Or, perhaps most
importantly, how Republican lead-
ers in Washington position in their
first months in office should they
win control of the House or, less
likely, of the Senate.
For those reasons and more,
Republicans considering running
are, in the words of Barbour, "keep-
ing their powder dry."
They're carefully watching the.
president, as well as one another,
as they try to map out plans in an
unpredictable political climate.
And, they're keeping an eye out for
any signs that independents like
New York Mayor Michael Bloom-
berg will make a move.
For Romney, there's little reason
to get into the mix now - much
less first. The former Massachu-
setts governor lost the nomination
in 2008 to John McCain and is
well-known in Iowa, New Hamp-
shire, South Carolina and other
early primary states. Plus, he's got
deep pockets should he decide to
tap his personal fortune. And he's
ahead of the pack in organiza-
tion, with the remnants of his first
White House campaign.
Barbour, Mississippi's governor
and the chairman of the Republi-
can Governor's Association, plans
to spend the rest of the year revel-
ing in expected gubernatorial vic-
tories on Nov. 2. He'll hold court at
an RGA meeting next month in San
Diego. As chairman, he's solidi-
fied his stature as a national party
leader and proven that he's capable
of raising mounds of money. He's
been huddling with advisers as he
considers a White House run.
Gingrich, the former House
speaker from Georgia, also is in
no rush. He's waiting until at least
March to disclose his intentions.
He already has a ready-made cam-
paign organization, fundraising

base and grass-roots following
through his American Solutions
policy network, and he essentially
has been running from that pllat *
form all year.
The later the start of the 2012
campaign, the better for celeb-
rity politicians like Palin, the py.-
governor of Alaska and 2008 vce
presidential nominee, and former
Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckaeg,
who have lucrative media anoI
speaking contracts. They'd preb-
ably have to cut those ties should
they enter the race. Demand for
their time could well dry up if they
say they're not running. Plus, as
long as they keep people guessip*,
they're sure to get plenty of atten-
tion.
Aspirants who are not nearlygas
well-known - like former Penn-
sylvania Sen. Rick Santorum or
Indiana Rep. Mike Pence - could
benefit from getting in soonqr
rather than later because of the
free media attention. , -
While Pawlenty falls into that
category, the Minnesota governqr
suggested he'd announce wheth-
er he would run around MaAeh.
Republican insiders consider it
inevitable that he'll get in atr
more than a year of planning. He
leaves his post in January afterctwo
terms and will promote his new
book, "Courage to Stand," a lqur
that could serve to boost his prqfiie
nationally.
South Dakota Sen. John Thune
and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels
have indicated to associates thqt
they're in no hurry either.
Thune is part of the GOP's leqd-
ership team, and has been talking
in private about a possible bid.
And Daniels has hosted a serie9,nf
closed-door dinners with top GOP
fundraising, business and policy
leaders as he gauges his chances0
Nearly all have sent money froap *
their political action committ;es

Bin Laden threatens
France over veil ban

I *~ ' 1MEL

In recording, Bin
Laden criticizes
French involvement
in Afghanistan
CAIRO (AP) - Al-Qaida leader
Osama bin Laden threatens in
a new audio tape to kill French
citizens to avenge their co6ntry's
support for the U.S.-led war in
Afghanistan and a new law that
will ban face-covering Muslim
veils.
In the tape obtained by satel-
lite television station Al-Jazeera
and then posted on its website
yesterday, bin Laden said France
was aiding the Americans in the
killing of Muslim women and
children in an apparent reference
to the war in Afghanistan. He
said the kidnapping of five French
citizens in the African nation of
Niger last month was a reaction
to what he called France's oppres-
sion of Muslims.
"How can it be right that you
participate in the occupation of
our lands, support the Ameri-
cans in the killing of our women
and children and yet want to live
in peace and security?" said bin

Though he said he couldn't com-
ment on any specific reasons why
the University's student-athlete
graduation rate dropped from 1999
to 2003, Ablauf said a possible rea-
son for the decrease could have
been coaching changes in various
sports.
"I do know that during that 2000
to 2003 time frame we did have
some coaching changes, which
would've affected the graduation
rate numbers overall," Ablauf said.

Laden, addressingthe French.
"It is a simple and clear equa-
tion: As you kill, you will be
killed. As you capture, you will
be captured. And as you threaten
our security, your security will
be threatened. The way to safe-
guard your security is to cease
your oppression and its impact on
our nation, most importantly your
withdrawal from the ill-fated
Bush war in Afghanistan." '
The authenticity of the tape
could not be immediately verified
but the voice resembled that of
the terror group leader on previ-
ous tapes determined to be genu-
ine.
French Interior Minister Brice
Hortefeux told the parliament
hours after the message was post-
ed that the risk of a terror attack
against the country was real and
authorities' vigilance is "total,"
according to a report on newspa-
per El Figaro's website.
But he added that the threats
"would merely fit into the pat-
tern of different threats that have
already been made against our
country and our citizens, at home
and abroad. It currently appears
that these comments don't do
more than justify our keeping up
our response in the face of the ter-
highest GSR graduation rate at
the University, according to the
mostrecent data, was men's tennis,
with alOO-percentgraduation rate.
While women's field hockey, golf,
softball and tennis all share top
marks with a 100-percent gradua-
tion rate.
The men's and women's bas-
ketball programs - at 36 and 53
percent GSR graduation rates,
respectively - are each the men's
and women's sport with the lowest
graduation rate at the University.
Both programs also have the low-
est graduation rate in the Big Ten in
their respective sports.
The football program boasted
a 72-percent GSR graduation rate,
ranking 5th in the Big Ten. North-
western University's football pro-

rorist threat."
Tapes by bin Laden and his top
lieutenant, Egyptian-born Ayman
al-Zawahri, have recently been
posted on Al-Jazeera website
rather than on sites run by mili-
tant Muslims as has been done for
years. The shift appears to reflect
the unexplained technical dif-
ficulties or closures experienced
by the militant sites in recent
months.
France has about 4,000 troops
deployed in and near Afghani-
stan.
"You need to think of what
happened to America as a result of
that unjust war," bin Laden said,
again addressing the French and
referring to the war in Afghani-
stan. "It's on the verge of bank-
ruptcy ... and tomorrow it will
retreat to beyond the Atlantic."
France passed a law this month
that will ban the wearing of face-
covering burqa-style Muslim veils
in public starting in April. Many
Muslims have expressed fears the
law would stigmatize them.
"If you deemed it your right to
ban (Muslim) women from wear-
ing the hijab, then should not it be
our right to expel your invading
men by striking their necks?" bin
Laden said.

graduating 95 percent of its mem-
bers.
Though the GSR data is only
broken down by sport, the Depart-
ment of Education FGR figures are
broken down by ethnicity and gen-
der as well.
According to the FGR data
released yesterday, for student-
athletes who enrolled in the Uni-
versity between 2000 and 2003,
66 percent of male student-athletes
graduated, while 86 percent of
female student-athletes earned
their degrees.
The FGR data also shows 81
percent of white student-athletes
graduated, compared to 69 percent
of Hispanic student-athletes and 55
percent of black student-athletes.

"If it's got a 'D' after its name,

Thayrone X spoke about issues
like closing the border to Mexi-
co, improving the economy and
reforming the country's health
care.
Wendy Day, founder of Com-
mon Sense in Government told
the crowd "You have to believe
in common sense to vote for Dr.

ernment identifies as a non-parti-
san organization and according to
its website, Day helped organize
the first Tea Party rally in Lansing

ple that wanted to go and do those
kinds of things we would prob-
ably be having them."
Aside from the dance parties,
Sava's has also implemented a
new drink list with offerings for
the novice drinker, a happy hour
and awine list.
Nkosi Booi and DJ Cisco, the
promoter for Salsa Detroit - the
company that is hosting the Latin
nights at Sava's - said they think
the dance nights have helped
business by targeting the late-
night and after-dinner crowds.
"After dinner, she would have
a really light crowd," Booi said.
"But after us, she would have
some people who would stay."
"Some actually planned hav-
ing dinner here so they could
come to salsa night," DJ Cisco
added.
Bertsos agreed saying that
sincethe license was issued Sava's
"businesshas changed alot."
Sava's dance nights encour-
age people to stop by the restau-
rant at later hours and hopefully
will appeal to the younger stu-
dents, not just local Ann Arbor
residents, Bertsos said.
"I think the climate will
change over time but right now
it is mostly grad students, med
school students and profession-

ter) said he was surprised*by the
strong turnoutand hoped to "take
back our country."
Michael Bouchard, Oakland
County sheriff and former Repub-
lican candidate for governor,
echoed Bishop's sentiments, say-
ing that it was time for someone
to replace Dingell.
"If you can't get it done in 55
years, (it's) time to go home,"
Bouchard said.
Greeted by loud cheers of sup-
port from the crowd, Steele took
the stage and began to outline his
qualifications for the position and
the policies he would push for if
elected.
"I'm not a politician," he said.
Steele said he's the best can-
didate to bring accountability to
Washington, adding "we need to
stop the out of control spending."
Steele told the crowd that he's
grown frustrated with Dingell
during the congressman's tenure
in Washington.
"We need representatives that
will represent," Steele said. "We
need transparency."
als," said Paul Arias, a mechani-
cal engineering graduate student,
who's attended dance events at
the caf6. "But as for undergrads,
they might start to know about it
over time."
Environmental engineering
graduate student Angelica Perez
added that the Friday night time
slot encourages people to come to
dinner and stay for dancing.
Day-time waiter Steve Brad-
ley said he also noticed a change
in business since the restaurant
finally got its liquor license. He
added that Sava's regular custom-
ers were the most excited about
the restaurant finally getting a
liquor license.

Steele added that youth stand
to suffer the greatest losses from
a Congress that doesn't represent
its constituents.
"The youngpeople on this cam-
pus are in the greatest danger," he
said.
In an interview following the
event, Steele said he was disap-
pointed in the student turnout for
the event but hopes that students
will still come out and vote on
Tuesday.
"We hope the students par-
ticipate in the process," he said.
"It's always disappointing when
they're not here learning about
what's going on. The spending
that is killing the students is what
they need to wake up to."
Steele added that his campaign
is focused on curbing the cost of
higher education for students.
"The costs are absolutely out of
control, and unfortunately one of
the main reasons the costs are out
of control is the federal govern-
ment," he said. "It wouldbe better
for them to just cut down to the
price at cost."
He said he serves a lot of wine
and beer during happy hour but
that the mixed drinks are popular
too.
In addition to the new licens-
es, Sava's revamped its appear-
ance and made efforts to reach
out to the community to keep its
business booming, Bertsos said.
The restaurant was painted and
redecorated, and the floors are
being redone.
"I know that one of Sava's top
priorities is to make a home away
from home for students," she said.
"We realize Ann Arbor is mostly
made up of students, and we want
to givethem a place they can come
and feel comfortable."

Yes on 1, no on 2
State needs ConCon, voters need freedom
allot proposals can lead to big change and Michigan resi-
dents have seen firsthand the difference they can make
- both positive and negative. This year's proposals aren't
quite as divisive as hot-button issues like same-sex marriage, affir-
mative action and medical marijuana, but they could still have a
noticeable effect on the state's government. This election cycle, the
there are two ballot proposals being considered statewide. Proposal
1 asks voters if Michigan should hold a constitutional convention.
Proposal 2 would create a constitutional amendment forbidding
people convicted of a violation of public trust from holding public
office. Students should head to the polls to cast their vote on Michi-
gan's ballot initiatives.

Don't ear oreign trade

hings have gotten so bad for
Democrats this election cycle
that President Barack Obama
is picking fights
and swinging at the
air. Desperate to
resist an onslaught
of Republican vic-
tories next week,
Democrats are pull-
ing out the "fear of
foreigners" card,
criticizing trade
policies and lobby- ALEX
ing for protectionist BILES
measures in hopes
of salvaging the
upcoming elections.
Disdain for foreigners or things
non-American bares its ugly face in
cycles. Republican politicians and
their supporters have had a tendency
to scapegoat foreigners to capital-
ize on the fears of Americans. But
recently, Democratic candidates have
also utilized race-baiting while attack-
ing trade with China in a last-ditch
attempt to appeal to working-class
voters. Take Mark Schauer (D-Mich.),
who has run advertisements criticizing
what he calls unfair trade with foreign
countries. In one segment, Schauer is
pictured speaking with homogenous
groups of middle-aged, working-class
white people. In the ad, he explicitly
attacks trade with China not once, but
twice. He emphasizes hi' position by
highlighting the words "pgainst" and
"jobs in China" inbold yellow.
Citing the trade deficit, Congressio-
nal Democrats have pushed for tariffs
and import restrictions on Chinese
goods. Apparently, they learned noth-
ing from the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff
Act, which raised tariffs on more than
20,000 imported goods and is widely
considered one of the worst economic
decisions in American history.
Take for example, Richard Trumka,
head of the AFL-CIO - the nation's
largest labor union and a major finan-
cier of the Democratic Party - who
invoked notions of a "trade war with
China" in a Sept. 30 USA Today article.
Trumka calls for the U.S. to forcefully
stop the Chinese from manipulat-

ing their currency's value. These calls
haven't rang hollow. Democrats have
recently introduced numerous pieces
of trade-restricting legislation, and
on Sept. 28, a New York Times article
by Yale University economist Stephen
Roach stated that Obama is "prepared
to take forceful actions if China doesn't
budge" on the issue of its currency
manipulation and the trade deficit.
There's a fundamental misconcep-
tion that a trade deficit is bad. The
trade deficit is the difference between
the value of imports and exports
betweeneconomies. Some worry about
our annual trade deficit to China,
which reached $226 billion in 2009,
but they're incorrect in thinking that's
a bad thing. A trade deficit with China
means that the value of Chinese goods
that we're purchasing is greater than
the value of American goods pur-
chased by the Chinese.
We can illustrate that concerns
over mass importation of Chinese
goods are irrational by utilizing the
trade relationship between you (an
average consumer) and Meijer as
an example. Assume you regularly
shop at Meijer, importing goods sold
by the store into your home. Meijer
has likely never purchased anything
from you. From your perspective, the
trade deficit between you and Meijer
is enormous. But this trade deficit has
never harmed you. On the contrary,
Meijer's specialization provides easy
access to goods that would other-
wise take a great deal of effort and
resources to acquire. The accessibili-
ty, affordability and efficiency are the
same reasons for trading with China.
Both parties benefit.
The Obama administration and
Congressional Democrats want to
forcefully stop China from manipu-
lating its currency to export goods
at affordable prices. But as Roach
points out, "forcing such a currency
realignment would be a blunder of
historic proportions." Advocates of
trade restrictions claim they want
the pie sliced equally between the
United States and China, but these
threats only amount to higher prices
for American consumers as a result of

tariffs and protection from competi-
tion for politically-connected Ameri-
can manufacturers. Not surprisingly,
beneficiaries include labor unions
and special interests that provide
millions to the Democratic Party.

The trade
deficit with
China is good.

Ballot initiatives are an inherently
flawed phenomenon. Inevitably, they
lead to poorly-worded and inadequately
thought-out legislation. Case in point: the
ballot proposal that in 2008 legalized med-
ical marijuana in the state. Though medi-
cal marijuana is a valuable treatment for
many, the ballot proposal led to a law that's
unclear, in some ways contradictory and
overall ineffective. And other ballot initia-
tives simply reflect people's reactionary
bias that damages important civil liber-
ties. For example, Michigan's 2004 ban on
same-sex marriage. Ballot proposals more
often reflect partisanship and a mob men-
tality than thoughtful discussion. It's the
purpose of the legislature to create useful,
clear legislation that reflects the desires of
legislators' constituencies.
But, despite their inherent flaws, ballot
proposals exist and voters must make a
decision.
roposal 1 offers voters the option to
hold a constitutional convention.
According to the current constitu-
tion, this proposal must be presented to
voters every 16 years. A constitutional con-
vention would call for delegates to revise
the state constitution, which will then be
approved or rejected by voters. Michigan's
last constitutional convention took place
from 1961 to 1962, and we are long over-
due for a revision. Voters should vote yes
for Proposal 1 in November to modify the
Michigan Constitution.
It's been a longtime since Michigan took a
comprehensive look at its constitution. This
isn't the same state it was 50 years ago -
the economy and the fall of the automotive
industry is proof of that. A new constitution
could reflect the needs of today's economy
and help define the state's future.
one of the concerns about holding a
constitutional convention is the expenses
involved. That's a valid worry considering
Michigan's already-strained budget. But the
convention could also raise money for the
state if it revamps the tax system. Michi-
gan's current flat income tax is disturbingly
behind the times. A new, graduated income
tax could be included in the revisions and
would help increase state revenue.
And the convention could clear the
constitution of amendments that limit the
civil liberties of Michigan's citizens - spe-
cifically, the ban on same-sex marriage. A
constitutional convention could reverse
this policy completely and finally allow
members of the LGBT community the
equality they deserve.

But it's crucial that the constitution
isn't modified in any way that threatens
the autonomy of the University or its state
funding. The freedom that the University
enjoys has led - and will lead - to valuable
research that will bring jobs to the state and
revitalize the economy. And keeping this
research and education accessible requires
adequate state support. If there is a consti-
tutional convention, delegates must respect
the University's value to the state.
Though these concerns are important to
keep in mind, the constitutional conven-
tion would ultimately benefit our state. To
give Michigan's constitution the update it
needs, vote YES on Proposal 1.
he other ballot initiative, Proposal 2,
is worrisome. The initiative would
amend the state constitution so that
any person convicted of a felony involving
betrayal of public trust would be ineligible
for election to public office for 20 years.
The proposal attempts to curb corrup-
tion, following several instances of decep-
tion and fraud in Detroit, including the
scandal around former Mayor Kwame Kil-
patrick and city council member Monica
Conyers. But this very visceral reaction
to Detroit's corruption doesn't give voters
the credit they deserve and discriminates
against people who have already paid for
their crimes.
The proposal's aim is a little too
Orwellian. Michigan voters should have
the freedom to vote for whomever they
like, regardless of the candidate's past.
The proposal seems to assume that voters
aren't capable of deciding for themselves
which candidates are acceptable. It's a bit
insulting to the public's intelligence. But
voters can - and should be able to - decide
which candidates they can trust and which
are most appropriate for a position.
In addition to limiting voter freedom,
the proposal also seems to ignore one of the
central philosophies of the judicial system.
The idea of the judicial system should be to
help reform and reintegrate back into society
those who have broken the law. The stipula-
tion that a felon should be ineligible for pub-
lic office up to 20 years after their conviction
throws the concept of moral reformation out
the window. In our society, those who have
paid their debt to society following a convic-
tion deserve the benefit of the doubt.
Ultimately, the citizens of the state of
Michigan shouldn't need a law to tell them
which candidates they can vote for. Pro-
posal 2, though it aims to solve corruption,
is misguided. Vote NO on Proposal 2.

But focus on trade relations with for-
eigners isn't limited to thectrade deficit.
Recently, Obama carelessly attacked
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce - a
lobbying organization that supports
free trade. Obama and establishment
Democrats accused the group of uti-
lizing foreign contributions to support
candidates inthe United States, despite
no evidence to back up their claims, as
Time magazine reported on Oct.14.
And in an embarrassing 'blunder
for the party, the Center for Respon-
sive Politics revealed on Oct. 17 that
Democrats have taken $1.02 million
this election cycle from foreign-af'll *
iated Political Action Committees
twice as much as Republicans. Tb
Obama administration isn't ha #
enough with its role in reducing
freedom of individuals to lobby p6l"
ticians. They want to be hypocrit6
while they're atit.
If the Obama administration a
Congressional Democrats were
enact trade restrictions or forcef,04

it would be devastating to our econo-
my and a blow to maintaining peace-
ful relations with China. But when
they're hypocrites using manufactured
information in a backfiring smear
campaign, their desperate attempts to
mitigate. November losses with politi-
cal demagoguery are as clear as a slibH
of Chinese-imported glass.

Embra ce your awkwardness

was a pretty awkward kid. Now,
I realize you could say that all
kids are awkward - and you
may even have a
point - childhood
is hardly anyone's
prime. But if you'd
seen me in elemen-
tary school, my
inelegance might
have surprised
you. In my earlyL
years, I was short
and overweight. MATTHEW
I hadn't been for- GREEN
mally introduced
to deodorant,
which was a prob-
lem because I sweated a lot. That's
not to say I played sports or partici-
pated vigorously in gym class. I just
sweated a lot. In spite of this image,
though, I was somehow spirited
enough to pursue the same girl tire-
lessly, if unsuccessfully, from the
fourth grade through the seventh..
My failure at courtship was best
summarized in my own words, from
a diary entry dated February 10, 2001:
"***** will never love me. I:NEVER say
the right thing! Ugg. I guess it's just
because I'm fat, smelly, gross and Jew-
ish." In hindsight, Jewishness prob-
ably had nothing to do with it, but it's a
common enough scapegoat, I suppose.
This first diary entry directly precedes
another passage in which I described
ripping my pants while bendingtover to
pickup apencilthats*****had dropped.
This "phase," as my mother liked to
call it, never really ended. Upon going
through puberty (late, of course),
I grew about a foot in just a couple
months. Hastily getting used to my
taller stature, I routinely tripped and
fell wherever I went. And, for what-
ever reason, I never really regained
my balance.

One day in the first few weeks of
my freshman year, this gracelessness
came to the fore. As I quickly strode
through the Diag that day, I looked
around to gain a further grasp of my
new surroundings. Then, before I real-
ized what was happening, I tripped on
something oddly cumbersome coming
toward me and fell flat on the ground.
I was instantly met by the sounds of a
baby crying and the shrieks of a moth-
er in panic. It didn't take long for me
to realize: I had tripped on an oncom-
ing stroller. Fortunately, the confused
infant was totally unharmed and his
mother, rather than filing a lawsuit,
just bitterly asked if I were high.
To this day, clumsiness continues
to pervade my life. I still trip all the
time and I still never say the right
thing. And if you ever have the rare
opportunity to see me dance, my
inability tobe cool even on the dance
floor will simultaneously amuse,
bewilder and disturb you.
So, since awkwardness has defined
so much of my life, I've recently
decided that I ought to embrace it.
I just have to try to find the beauty
within my ungainliness. It's got to
be there somewhere. I've meditated
on the words of Diane Arbus, the
photographer known for shooting
evocative photos of unusual sub-
jects in the 1960s. "I work from awk-
wardness," she famously said. "If I
stand in front of something, instead
of arranging it, I arrange myself."
Though awkwardness, in this case,
is the point of departure for Arbus' s
art, it may as well be the springboard
for approaching my own life. Rather
than attempting to be less awkward
as I go forward and "arrange" myself,
perhaps I really do just need to appre-
ciate the blunders and gaucherie that
are omnipresent in my life.
While I realize that I'm a sort of

caricature of clumsiness, this lessot
is relevant for a great many withjin,
our campus community. And it isp't
just a banal "love who you are" sort of.
lesson from a children's book.
Appreciate -
the blunders
and gaucherie.
Virtually all of us at the Univer-
sity are anxious about our individ'ua
appearance in some way. Perhhpt
it's important to you to confidently
walk down the street, to wear a per-
fectly neat outfit and be charming ti,
the friends and acquaintances you
bump into. But inevitably, you know
you're going to miss a social cue, or
make a fashion faux pas. Or maybe
you obsess about having the perfect
portfolio, with the perfect intervi4
skills to match. But no matter how
many times you rehearse in front 'sf
a mirror, your interview won't always
go as planned. Awkwardness is more
or less inevitable. So why not embrace
said awkwardness? Perhaps doing
so could make you stand out - to
friends, love interests or employers.
That's what I tell myself, at least.
And it hasn't led to more tripping or
accidentally spraying water on SAyl
crotch when I wash my hands. Those
gaffes are as frequent as they always-
were. But as I accept my awkward,-,
ness, I'm much more content in my,
day-to-day life - even if I still fear,
strollers in the Diag.

He's tied for the team lead in
scoring and a majority of fans
don't know his first name.
Senior forward Charles
Vaughan has four goals in the
Michigan hockey team's first six
games after scoring twice Sat-
urday night against Nebraska-
Omaha. More commonly know to
the Michigan faithful as "Scoot-
er," Vaughan shares the top of
the Wolverines' scoring list with
junior David Wohlberg.
But it's been a long and unlikely
journey to the top for the current
third-liner. Vaughan came to Ann
Arbor as a defenseman and was
expected to be a two-way player
on the Michigan blue line. In two
inauspicious years at defenseman,
Vaughan never got the offense
going. He had just nine points in
his career - all assists.
In Vaughan's sophomore year, he
struggled to hold a spot in the line-
up, playing in just 25 of his team's 41
games. So before his junior year, the
coaching staff moved him to for-
ward. After battling inconsistency
lastseason, Vaughan has adapted to
his new role.
"He's got speed," Michigan
coach Red Berenson said. "The
reason I put him on forward is
because he can skate, he's got
power, he's got puck handling
skills. I thought he could be a
good forward. I thought he was
in and out last year, he never real-
ly got into a groove where he got
some confidence."
Vaughan's attitude and skating
ability caught Berenson's eye in
the preseason skates this Septem-
ber. Those strengths have earned
him not only a regular spot in the
lineup, but also extra time on the
penalty kill.
And the consistency is pay-
ing off. His four goals this sea-
son have doubled his career total
coming into the season. Also, his
five points through six games are
one shy of his career best. But
instead of focusing solely on goal
scoring, Vaughan is just looking

j1efore the season, Michigan
rpsning backs coach Fred Jack-
son made it clear that he was con-
fident in each of his five running
baeks - junior Mike Shaw, soph-
omore Vincent Smith, freshman
Stephen Hopkins, sophomore
Mike Cox and redshirt freshman
Fitz Toussaint.
Jackson went as far to say that
 none of those five ballcarriers
would be the No. 1 guy.
"I think you're going to see
theb whole season and not real-
ly know who's who," Jackson
said. "Because now I've got guys
attuned, that can do everything."
--But through half the season
Michigan's leading rusher has
been its- quarterback - sopho-
more Denard Robinson - and the
majority of the Wolverines' play-
ing time at running back has gone
to Shaw and Smith. They, along
with Robinson, have accounted
fot-1,701 of Michigan's 1,971 total
rushing yards.
l4opkins has received an
increased amount of work in the
past few weeks and could be get-
ting into the Shaw-Smith rotation.
But Toussaint and Cox have
been relatively absent from the
field, and in his weekly telecon-

Wild first goal, a
&0-yarder, sets tone
as Wolverines find
Ohio catharsis
By JOHN EPPLER
For the Daily
After a tough loss against No.
1 Akron last Tuesday, the Michi-
ganmen's
soccer BOWLING GREEN I
team let MICHIGAN 5
0nt its
0 fsstration on another Ohio foe.
Bowling Green made its way
intyAnn Arbor last night expect-
iqg to contend in its matchup
against the Wolverines - they
didn't realize, however, that they
had just signed up for target prac-
tice.
As the clock ran down to
zero and Michigan's offensive
onslaught came to an end, the
scoreboard at the brand new UM
Soccer Complex read 5-1.

Michigan struck first, thir-
teen minutes into the game, with
a snipe from freshman forward
Soony Saad.
After a diving save from Wol-
verine junior goaltender Chris
Blais, a quick counterattack
allowed Saad to find the Falcon
goalkeeper out of position. He
delivered a booming shot from
60 yards away, and scored the
longest goal in Michigan soccer
history.
"We have seen him do it,"
Michigan coach Steve Burns said
after the game. "He saw the keep-
er out. He is a very aware player,
so he went for it."
After the shot went in, the
momentum of the game instantly
shifted. Just one second earlier,
after all, visiting Bowling Green
(5-7-2 overall) was threatening to
score.
Within minutes, Michigan
(2-2-0 Big Ten, 9-4-3 overall)
scored another, an unassisted
blast from senior forward Justin
Meram.
"After last week, we just came

in knowing we had to get the
win," Meram said.,
The Wolverines added two
more goals in the first half. The
first was a long-range score from
senior forward Alex Wood, and
the second another counterattack
goal from Meram.
Michigan picked up right
where it left off in the second
half, as Saad scored a goal off of
a through ball from his brother,
junior midfielder Hamoody Saad.
But then, the pace of the game
changed. The second half slowed,
as most of play settled into the
midfield.
Meanwhile, Meram and the
Saad brothers watched from the
bench - their work was done.
Through a counter-attack
offense and long shots, the Wol-
verines found the net, though
they took fewer shots than their
season average.
"We were due for a breakout
game since September," Burns
said.
Last night, under the lights at
home, they found it.

preserve students' learning expe-
riences.
If successfully completed, the
additional cuts would bring the
total amount in cost containment
at the University to $355 million in
annual recurring costs.
"We invest in our future by pro-
viding record levels of financial
aid to students and modest sal-
ary increases to faculty and staff,"
Coleman said in her speech. "We
invest by being aggressive in how
we use energy, by being more effi-
cient with administrative func-
tions and by taking more control
of our personal health to hold
down insurance costs."
The effort to cut the additional
$120 million will be led by Univer-
sity Provost Philip Hanlon, who
serves as chief academic officer
and chief budget officer, Coleman
said. According to her speech, the
campus community should expect
to hear more from him about the
efforts in the near future.
Though decisions on specific
measures are largely undecided,
several University officials have
told The Michigan Daily they are
considering cost-cutting measures
to the University's information
technology division, to shared ser-
vices operations and reorganizing
maintenance of campus facilities.
"Just as the external world has
changed, we too need to introduce

the same kinds of internal innova-
tion," Coleman said. "As we have
been, we will be deliberate and
thoughtful, focusing on reduc-
ing administrative and opera-
tional costs, with an eye firmly on
enhancing the academic mission."
Coleman also highlighted plans
approved by the University's
Board of Regents in June as part
of the University's annual budget
proposal to allocate funding for
the hiring of 50 additional faculty
members.
"In this year's budget we have
funded an additional SO tenure-
track faculty positions," Cole-
man said. "This complements the
ongoing junior faculty initiative
and ultimately will improve our
student-faculty ratio. We are look-
ing to our deans for how best to
structure these positions, which
will be filled by scholars with a
wide range of experience."
The proposal in June came
after Coleman's 2007 announce-
ment that $30 million in central
funding would be allocated to hire
100 junior level faculty members
with expertise in various interdis-
ciplinary studies, which Coleman
also discussed yesterday.
"Three years ago, we launched
an initiative to hire 100 junior
faculty up-and-coming profes-
sors committed to interdisciplin-
ary teaching and research that
explores the truly complex issues
of our day," Coleman said. "Our
faculty and deans have collabo-
rated on fascinating proposals for

these new teams, and to date we
have funded more than 70 posi-
tions, with 25 faculty already
hired and on campus."
Coleman also highlighted stu-
dent-recruiting efforts aimed at
maintaining the high academic
standards of the University.
"Recruiting the best also
applies to students. We continue
to attract exceptional students at
all levels of study," Coleman said.
"Students are drawn to our cam-
puses because of what we have to
offer, and we offer a lot."
Throughout the speech, Cole-
man also highlighted the innova-
tive research and teaching being
done by faculty that helps advance
the academic mission of the Uni-
versity and showcased the work
of a few students on campus who
have exemplified the Michigan
experience. Students she cited
included those who go above and
beyond in their classes, those
who use extra-curricular activi-
ties to supplement their studies
and a group of students who will
soon have a satellite they designed
launched into space.,
"Faces change, buildings fall
and rise, economies wax and
wane. The University of Michi-
gan thrives," Coleman finished
her speech by saying. "We thrive
because a great public university
always looks forward, knowing
there is nothing more powerful,
more invigorating and more essen-
tial than creating and sharing
knowledge."

best meets students' needs, Alex-
ander said she and her colleagues
held informal focus group meet-
ings with students and surveyed
students entering the library for
suggestions.
"I started doing discussions
with student groups because I
really think that it's really impor-
tant to hear what students have
to say because this is going to be a
student space, soI wanted to make
sure that the space was reflective of
what students wanted to see there,"
Alexander said.
The improved lobby will also
serve as a venue for poetry read-
ings, speakers and workshops.
"We hope it will be a space that
promotes learning and creativity,"
she said.
Student opinions on the con-
struction project have been mixed
so far.
LSA senior Louise Kane said
the construction shouldn't pose
too many issues so long as it's not a
glaring distraction.
"I don't really think it's a big deal

unless it affects the quietness,"
Kane said.
Ricky Kramer, also an LSA
senior, said he is excited to see how
the lobby renovations will turn out.
"It seems like they're always
doing construction, but I think it
will pay off in the end," he said.
Alexander said she believes that
the noise from construction won't
greatly affect students and their
studying.
"The undergraduate (library)
is actually loud anyway, so I really
think noise will be minimal," she
said.
LSA freshman Yanique Foster
said she's not sure the renovations
justify the hassle from construc-
tion.
"It's sort of annoying with all
the noise that comes with the con-
struction," she said. "It makes me
wonder about the rest of the con-
struction on campus (and) if it's all
thatnecessary and how much of my
tuition money is paying for this."
The construction for the lobby
was funded entirely through dona-
tions made by Bert Askwith, a 1931
LSA graduate, who has donated
funds to other projects such as Bert's
Cafe and the Askwith Media Library.

Alexander said the new lobby
will be named "Bert's Study
Lounge" in honor of Askwith.
The construction to the lobby
will start early in the morning and
end early in the afternoon each
day until its completion, Alex-
ander said. The renovations are
projected to be complete by mid-
February.
The first step of the construction
- buildingtemporary walls around
the site to close off the area from
library-goers and to redirect traffic
around it - has already been com-
pleted, Alexander said.
According to the University's
Library website, signs will be put
up in the UGLi in order to-help stu-
dents safely navigate the construc-
tion site.
There is a temporary entrance
next to the driveway near South
University Avenue and another one
through Bert's Caf6, which will
remain open throughout the dura-
tion of the remodeling process.
The website alsonotes thatwhile
construction is taking place, a tem-
porary circulation desk has been
moved to the southwest entrance of
the library with another one next to
Bert's Cafe.

EPISODE REVIEW

For the past few seasons, it seems
that "Weeds" has gone from origi-
nal storylines
to plots that
are just plain
crazy. In its Weeds
most recent
episode, which
takes place "Dearborn-Again"
in Dearborn, Showtime
Michigan, this
craziness has
reached a point of no return.
The main source of this madness
comes from the over-the-top nar-
rative that tries too hard to push
the limits that the show already
has pushed many times before.
The Botwin family started off as
a middle-class family whose mom
sold drugs to maintain their com-
fortable lifestyle - a unique twist
on the idealized middle-Ameri-
can family. But now, the family
is on the run from Nancy's (Mary
Louise-Parker) drug-lord ex-hus-
band, with whom she had a child,
because her other son Shane (Alex-

ander Gould) killed someone in his
posse. This has led them to Nancy's
hometown of Dearborn in order
to procure passports so they can
flee the country. Nancy has done a
complete 180 from the likeable and
relatable mom who just wanted to
make sure her kids were happy to a
manic, self-loathing drug dealer no
one can stand.
To make matters worse, the set
doesn't even attempt to look like
anything resembling Dearborn.
There are palm trees everywhere
and it seems to be sunny the entire
time, just like Los Angeles. The only
thing that's supposed to separate
L.A. from Dearborn is the abun-
dance of stereotypical Middle East-
ern people. Plus, the offensive jokes
about Muslims aren't even funny.
"Weeds" makes it seem like every0
single Muslim in Dearborn is a con-
niving thief. Looks like the offensive
jokes were all the "shocking" mate-
rial the program could come up with
this time.

TRAILER REVIEW

Flynn Meaney msay be new to
the teen novel scene, but he's read
his "Twilight" books. And Edwin
Mullen, the heart-shaped protago-
i:st of Meaney's bestselling vamp-
romance "Bloodthirsty," may be
new to the lonely town of Phorx,
but he has also read his "T wilight"
books. And so, when the beautiful
but aloof Ella appears in his biol-
ogy class one day, Edwin knows all
the right moves.
After a quick trip to the local
Spirit store, our hero gets into the
groove with a ness set of pointy
canines, a face fill of porcelain-
tinted foundation and some glitter
to apply when the sun comes out,
And before you can say "rip-off,"
Edwin is the newest and toothiest
heartthrob in Phorx, effortlessly
winningsover Ella as well as hordes
of young readers everywhere.

But how to keep up the fagade
of being a super-human sex sym-
bol when you've a way-too-curious
moody girlfriend poking around?
Mullen is good of heart and true
of blood, but he soon finds out it's
hard to fake extreme speed and
agility, and it gets tough for him
to muster map the strength to resist
Ella's advances because of his sup-
posed vampiric urge to bite - the
poor guy only wants to get laid.
What to do? Edwin's back hurts
from carrying Ella up the sides
of trees, but he can't give up his
newfound popularity or his true
love. Will Edwin tell Ella the truth
about his identity? Will she still be
with him, even knowing he's not
a real vampire? Behind the heart-
shaped fanged smiley face lies the
answer. -

Halloween Staff Picks
* "NEAR DARK"
Vampires, despite all recent pop-culture evidence to the contrary, don't suck. Matter of
fact, they're pretty damn freaky when handled in the right way. Take Kathryn Bigelow's *
1987 cult classic, in which bloodsuckers trek across the American southwest. No pretty-
boy whining here: This vamp clan would prefer to knife up their prey before feasting on the
sweet nectar of someone else's flesh. Ideally watched, you guessed it, near dark.
* "THE TWILIGHT ZONE"
There's never a better time than Halloween to revert back into the Golden Age of television
with Rod Serling's "The Twilight Zone." The eerie sci-fi series showcases the best TV writ-
ing of the decade and expertly flirts with the line between truly horrifying and hilariously
cheesy. Time travel, aliens, monsters and Serling's ever-creepy voice will make for an epic
Halloween weekend TV marathon.
* "THRILLER"
Well, duh. "Thriller" is bound up in Halloween
just as "Jingle Bells" is to Christmas; something
about the track's creaking doors, howling
wolves and weird Vincent Price narration cap-
tures the spirit of All Hallow's Eve better than
all the candy in the world. Spooky theatrics
notwithstanding, "Thriller" finds Michael at the
apex of his game; the way he rides that indel-
ible bassline is one of pop's greatest moments.
"Monster Mash" should be embarrassed. COURTESY OF EPIC
* "SWEENEY TODD" (THE MUSICAL)
Before Johnny Depp ever picked up his silver razors, "Sweeney Todd" took Broadway by
storm - a morbid, brooding, cannibalistic storm. The titular barber's dementia dominates
the stage, and the broadway production allows for an entire chorus to balladize his dark
struggle for revenge. As one of the greatest works by one of Broadway's greatest minds,
Stephen Sondheim, "Sweeney" is the ultimate horror musical.
0 SALEM
Want to celebrate All Hallow's Eve in a totally inaccessible, pretentious and hipster-to-the-
max fashion? Then check out Salem, the trendy new "witch house" band whose LP King
Night earned a7.5 on Pitchfork earlier this month. The aloof ambient sounds that drift
through the synths and mumbles are designed to weird you out, and rest assured you'll
be shivering behind your neon shades and hugging a can of PBR for comfort.

as a bat to do the overture to (the
operetta) Die Fledernaus, which
is the German word for 'bat.' They
sorehow suspended him upside-
down, and he conducted upside-
down."
The concert is tied together
by a series of madcap sketches
performed and written by the
conducting students. In fact,
the graduate students organize
the entire concert themselves -
everything from selecting the
music to finding costumes.
"We had a very fun time at the
costume shop, and we found some
great things," said Matthew Dell,
a first-year graduate student in
orchestral conducting. "There's a
lot of variety, a lot of wacky stuff."
This year's program includes a
wide range of favorite pieces from
the classical repertoire, including
Gustav Holst's "Jupiter" from The
Planets, Igor Stravinsky's Finale
from his ballet "The Firebird"
and Richard Strauss's "Dance of
the Seven Veils" froin his opera
"Salome." These pieces will be
conducted by Elliot Moore, Eiki
Isomura and Dell, respectively.
The concert also includes a few
Halloween-related pieces, such
as American composer George
Whitefield Chad wick's "Hobgob-
lin" from Symphonic Sketches (to
be conducted by Segal) and March
of the Little Goblins, a. piece by
Michigan alur Adam Glaser.
"It starts with just a few players
on stage, and then one by one the
sections file in," Segal said. "So at
the beginning of the concert you
get to see all the costumes of the
(musicians) as they walk on stage."
With its accessible program
and entertaining format, the Hal-
loween Concert is a favorite event
among students and community
rembers.

"There are people in town who
might never come to one of the
other Symphony or Philharmo-
nia concerts, but they come to
the Halloween concert, and they
get to hear a great orchestra play
great orchestral music," Jones
said. "The reason they enjoy it is
because it's funny and there are
fun costumes, but they also enjoy
the music, and that's worthwhile."
The concerts are also a great
opportunity for kids to get
acquainted with classical music in
a friendly atmosphere where they
can dress up in their Halloween
costumes.
"I think it's a big family event,
and there are people who have
come for years to the (Halloween
Concert)," Segal said. "At the end,
the conducting students run out
to the front of the house and hand
out candy to the kids for them
to get started on their trick-or-
treating. It's really fun to see them
there. They're usually laughing,
smiling and giggling, and they
have a real blast."
This year's concert is particu-
larly special because it happens to
fall on the same day as Halloween.
Segal hopes that this will draw an
extra-large crowd. He also point-
ed out that since the concert is in
the afternoon, it won't interfere
with youngsters' trick-or-treat-
ing.
For the musicians, who are used
to a more serious black-tie style of
concert, the Halloween Concert is
a much-appreciated change. Con-
certmaster Cave mentioned that
having kids in the audience also
helps to lighten the mood.
"Orchestra concerts can really
seem stuffy and old," Cave said.
"And having kids there laughing
and chatting - even during the
music - it's refreshing."

So, admission: I kind of hate
Halloween. I hate it so much
that I've been stressing out
over writing this column all week
simply because
I can't think
ofanything
to write. And
it's not just
because there's
never anything
good at the Sal-
vation Army, JENNIFER
or that it smells XU
like pumpkin
whenever I
walk into any kind of food store,
or even that the streets get obnox-
iously rowdy for like 10 days
preceding the actual holiday.
(Seriously, dressing up one day
is fine. Two days is OK, too. But
when you're going out seven days
a week, each in a different "sexy"
outfit, it's time to put on some real
clothes.) it's the pressure of it all.
In all honesty, much of my
beef with the holiday stems from
the fact that I can never think of
anything good to dress up as. The
extent of my creative stupidity is
truly boundless. The zenith of this
materialized during last year's
Halloween, when I tried to con-
vince three of-my friends to dress
up as the "Mean Girls" by snip-
ping holes in our t-shirts, which
would reveal circular pieces of
our multicolored bras underneath.
Needless to say, this idea did not
go over well.
For me, Halloween is all about
toeing the line between decency
and creativity. This takes more
thought thanI can possibly mus-
ter. It also takes good cutting
skills. Let me voice out a few of my
neuroticisms for you.
1. You have to make sure your
body is prepared if you want to
dress up like a (creative) slut. This
not only calls for working out
months in advance but also gradu-
ally building up a resistance to
30-degree weather, because Hal-
loween night is going to be freak-
ing cold.
2. If slut is not for you, the next
most important thing is to be
recognizable. The imperative is
not so much that you're creative
but that people will know what
you are. This way, you won't have
to keep answering the question,
"What are you supposed to be?"
all night.
3. But, at the same time, you
can't be too predictable. This usu-
ally means that you can't dress up
as a celebrity, because odds are
you're going to pick Lady Gaga,
Michael Jackson or the cast of
"Glee" (for reasons unknown to
me, because don't they just wear

regular clothes?), and so will
everybody else you know.
4. And you definitely can't dress
up as Snooki. I love "Jersey Shore"
as much as the next obsessed fan,
but you know how many people
are going to rock the fake-tan
guidette look. Don't worry - you
will find your "guido juicehead"
with or without your bumpit.
5. Once you actuallythink of
your idea, you have to go to some
vintage store or the Salvation
Army to buy all the stuff you need.
In the process, you're going to
see other people picking out stuff
for their costumes and feel bad
watching them plan out really
awesome ones while yours just
seems really stupid.
These kinds of stressors could
drive you to do truly crazy things,
such as buy one of those shirts
from Urban Outfitters that say:
"This is my costume." It's just so
easy! But when I'm feeling really
desperate, Ialways, always try to
keep this decree in my mind: Do
not, at all costs, shop for your cos-
tume at American Apparel.
Seriously, have you seen their
"costume builder" for this year?
Way to blatantly pass off clothes
you already own as a "costume."
My favorites among these stel-
lar selections are: "mermaid" (a

do, don't dress

bra top and two skirts around
your ankles), "sun and moon" (a
gray sweater and hot shorts) and
"cupcake" (three fluffy skirts over
your shoulders). The incentives
are even dumber - 15 percent off
your whole outfit on the chance
that you would like to purchase
these ridiculously expensive "cos-
tumes." Thanks, American Appar-
el, I'm so happy I get to save a
whole $30 off this $200 purchase
so I can puta skirt on top of my
head and call myself a "sexy nun."
So now that I've effectively
ruined your holiday and depressed
you beyond all reason, ignore
everything I just said. The truth
is, all you have to do is wear
a freaking costume - after a
while people will be too drunk to
remember what you came in as
anyway. Happy Halloween, you
guys.

My love for Bob Dylan is not a-changin

By CASSIE BALFOUR
DailyArts Writer
The name Bob Dylan evokes
images of an Americana maverick
who, despite slipping into count-
less musical styles, has maintained
his reputation as one of the great
songwriters of the 20th century.
But lately there have been blas-
phemous murmurs across cam-
pus of Dylan's failing voice and
poor stage manners. And now that
Dylan is returning to his college-
touring roots tonight at Hill Audi-
torium, I am forced to remind
everyone why the '60s icon is still
relevant to the youth of today in
spite of his supposed cantanker-
ous antics.
Now, I don't have much to add
to the decades-long conversa-
tion concerning Dylan, but I do
have the requisite Dylan post-
ers plastered to my walls, and I

My unconvinced friends. So even
though I'm intimidated by the
wealth of Dylan history, 1 will
speak with authority and humbly
soldier on.
Bob Dylan's command of gen-
erations of eager listeners is nearly
unmatched. How can one man
appeal to so many denmographics?
Personally, I can't even remember
how or why I started listening to
him. My parents are staunchly
anti-Dylan. My father does a terri-
ble impression of Dylan's vaguely'
nasally voice that lie thinks is just
hysterical. So I don'tnremember
who introduced him to me, but

into my memory of Bob is the one

this image and Dylan's discogra-
phy in my mind, I choose to ignore
the fact that maybe at 69, Dylan's

iconic voice isn't quite what itused
to be.
When friends breathlessly warn
me about Dylan's antics, I can't
help but shrug it off. When some-
one is as brilliant and ground-
breaking as Dylan, I couldn't care
less if he treats me as just one-in-
a-million. Hell, I'd let Bob sit on
me while he performs if it means

that still gives me chills. Cut Dylan
some slack for his rougher vocals
and curmudgeonly stage presence.
This is a chance to see one of the
great icons of the century perform

country. Don't let haters sway you
from making the right choice.

Indie horror descends on the Michigan

Bringing people together

frighteningly good cause
By CASSIE BALFOUR

On Devil's Night, the Michigan Theater
will be transformed into a terrifying circus
fit to host an indepen-

had visions of creating at 7

The result: the Three

The eclectic festival submissions range
from zombie movies to comedic stabs at the
genre. Submissions came locally from both
University of Michigan and Eastern Michi-
gan University students, as well as interna-
tionally from places as far as Denmark.
"We have everything from zombie mov-
ies, to broken families, to comedy. The film
festival is going to run the gamut of the
horror genre in just a few hours," Barkan
said. "All the films have their heart in the
right place and are really fun, even if some
are kind of low budget."
"I actually prefer the B-movies even
where the production is kinda crappy,"
added Brian Schmieder, an LSA senior and
the operations manager for the festival.

minutes rattling off a host of movie titles.
"I can't even narrow it down; I'm still
scanning my mental DVD collection of hor-
ror films," he said.
Eventually he cited "The Shining" asone
that still freaks him out to this day.
"It can be three in the afternoon, birds
tweeting, blinds open, and I will be scared
shitless for hours," he said.
The important idea these horror advo-
cates are pushing is to keep an open mind
about the horror genre.
"It's like when people say they don't like
metal even though there are tons of sub-
genres. Same thing with horror movies,

like the ones with a lot of gore and shock
value ... you just find what you like and
stand by it," Barkan said. "As you can see,
we have a lot of passion."
Ultimately, the team has high expecta-
tions for how they want the audience to
react to the spooky submissions.
"I want to see the audience freak out,"
Schmieder said.
"We want to have popcorn flying at
every scare and people screaming," Barkan
added.
With that, Anderson had some final
advice for would-be film fest attendees:
"Sissies stay home."

people to actually go through it."
Many consider "Alien Caged Clowns"
the most intense attraction at Night Ter-
rors.
After the structural, logistical and con-
ceptual details are all worked out, set deco-
ration commences. The goal: make it feel as
real as possible.
"We really want them to feel like they're
in (an) asylum or in a mine shaft," Wilson
said. "All the things that we can make seem
more real to give more of that terror effect
is what we try and go for."
Wilson describes this as one of the most
gratifying and genuinely fun parts for him,
because it allows for substantial hands-on
creativity.
Most of the props for Night Terrors
are purchased from garage sales, antique
shops or secondhand stores. A portion of
the set comes from employees, who bring
in objects that they otherwise would have
thrown away.
Nicole Karbacz, the "Head Witch" at
Krazy Hilda's Barn of Doom, explains that
it's quite the contrary for their homemade
attraction.

"Probably 85 percent of what I have is
something we've put together ourselves,"
she said.
For Karbacz, the key component to a
haunted house is the live-action perfor-
mance of its actors. She refers to the actors
that populate the Barn of Doom as "mon-
sters" and described how exactly these
monsters get to be so scary.
"There is an art to scaring people," she
said. "It's all about the timing and read-
ing their body language and listening. We
kind of listen to (the guests) as they're
approaching the place to scare and play
on those fears that we heard them talking
about."
If a child says "Dad, I'm scared," she will
respond by saying "Dad's not going to pro-
tect you."
The Barn of Doom's monsters also
use a tag-team technique to provide for
an extended scare, rather than numer-
ous isolated frights. The actors playing
monsters will give each other verbal cues
- for instance, a monster warning the visi-
tors to "watch out for my wolf" before the
wolf jumps out and scare them - which
requires a certain degree of improvisation
that most actors normally don't encounter.
Night Terrors also realizes the impor-
tance of performance and has a very selec-
tive process for hiring potential actors.

"We do a pretty intense interview pro-
cess," Wilson said. "We actually put them
in a couple of the scenes, tell them how
we want them to act out, give them all the
cues, give them what we want them to say
(and) the feelings we want them to get
across to the customer."
Wilson informs his candidates early on
of the high standards to which he holds his
actors.
"When we go through the interview
process, the first words out of my mouth
(are):'Don't think you're just going to jump
out of a corner with a flashlight,' " he said.
"Our customers pay to be terrified, that's
why they come here, and we want to ter-
rorize them."
The selection process for Krazy Hilda's
monsters is much less rigorous.
"I guess I just hang out with some real
scary people," Karbacz said.
Most of her monsters are friends and
acquaintances.
After an actor is hired at Night Terrors,
his or her job is to work wherever the event
managers see fit. This includes some peo-
ple playing the same part all the time, and
others alternating on a frequent basis.
"If we've got a real good guy in one
scene, and he's just phenomenal, we may
pull him out and make him a floater,
because he's got the energy," Wilson said.

p

"He'll float the whole event and scare you
five, six, seven times while you're in there."
Regardless of how effective an actor is,
impressive visual effects are necessary
to really make the experience terrifying.
Wilson said that smoke machines are used
to slow people down and strobe lights are
often employed to create a disorienting
effect for visitors. In addition to their abil-
ity to disorient, Karbacz said the strobe
lights she uses give inanimate objects a
sense of vitality.
"(We) try to place them to make the
object look like it's alive," she said.
Dimming or changing the color of the
lights can also enhance a room visually.
Lighting is most valuable in changing the
mood from room to room and never allow-
ing the customer to become too comfort-
able.
Karbacz also uses Day-Glo paint -
which she describes as "fluorescents under
blacklight" - and "Gotetraits," which are
"3-D pictures hanging on the wall with
creatures' faces on them," to enhance
rooms visually.
The soft colors of the Day-Glo paint lull
guests into a false sense of security because
of their contrast with the harsher mood
created by the lighting in other rooms.
One Goretrait features the face of a
monster that can be seen somewhere else
in the Barn of Doom. The intention is for
a visitor to see the terrifying portrait and
then see the face in real life later on.

The effectiveness of these methods are
difficult to measure, however, so customer
feedback is essential.
Wilson sees a constant need to keep
each attraction fresh, which he measures
through reactions after groups have gone
through the events at Night Terrors.
"We do a lot of talking," he said.
Event managers stand outside of the
attractions and ask the customers ques-
tions about what scared them the most.
Whether you're the kind of person who
looks under your bed at night or the kind of
person who never shudders while watch-
ing a horror movie, Wilson and Karbacz
both think their haunted attractions will
make you think twice next time you go out-
side in the dark.
"If you're here, you're getting scared,"
Wilson said. "Race, color, gender, it really
doesn't matter - they're all screaming and
yelling."
For Wilson, the most rewarding part of
his job is observing the toughest-looking
people crack under pressure.
"Even the biggest guys scream like
babies sometimes," he explained. "When
you've got a six-foot-two, three-hundred-
pound guy come running out of the exit of
'The Mind Shaft,' screaming his head off,
yeah, that's a good feeling."
Karbacz can relate to this feeling and
continues to do what she does for one sim-
ple reason: "I'm just passionate about scar-
ing the crap out of people."

Attractions at Wiard's Night Terrors include "Mind Shaft" and "Alien Caged Clowns
