On 
Wednesday 
evening, 

the 
United 
Asian 
American 

Organizations at the University 
of Michigan hosted a panel to 
promote the Asian, Pacific Islander 
American studies program on 
campus and call attention to a 
2017 lawsuit citing discrimination 
against program faculty.

Panelists 
included 
graduate 

and undergraduate students, as 
well as Emily Lawsin, a lecturer 

in American culture and women’s 
studies, and Scott Kurashige, a 
former professor in history and 
American culture.

In 2017, Lawsin and Kurashige 

brought a lawsuit against the 
University under claims of racial 
discrimination and harassment, 
citing the Michigan Elliott-Larsen 
Civil 
Rights 
Act. 
Currently, 

Kurashige explained, “the Dean 
of LSA is working with the chairs 
of the departments of women’s 
studies and American culture to 
fire Emily.”

Since 
the 
time 
of 
the 

controversy, 
students 
and 

community members have showed 
strong solidarity with Lawsin and 
actively tried to rebuild the A/PIA 
studies program. Their efforts 
include circulating a petition for 
the University to fully restore the 
A/PIA studies program, as well 
as releasing op-eds calling out 
the University’s actions against 
Lawsin, one of which was written 
by state Rep. Stephanie Chang.

As 
tensions 
surrounding 

employment and administrative 
responses mount, Lawsin and 
Kurashige 
have 
continued 
to 

serve as activists fighting for 
improvement of the A/PIA studies 
program, which was founded in 
1989 and offers courses and an 
academic minor. The program 
has gone from offering eight to 10 
classes per semester to only two in 
a previous winter semester.

Public 
Health 
sophomore 

Ciara Timban serves as the 
co-programming 
chair 
for 

UAAO and said she hopes the 
panel will bring attention to the 
opportunities available within the 
A/PIA studies program.

 
LSA sophomore Samuel Morse, 

an internship coordinator for 
Abdul El-Sayed’s gubernatorial 
campaign, believes the circulation 
of fake news on Facebook played a 
decisive role in the 2016 election.

“58 percent of American adults 

are on Facebook, and Facebook has 
become a primary news source for 
many of them,” Morse said. “So 
when people are, instead of picking 
up copies of The (Washington) Post 
and The (New York) Times, seeing 
that on their Facebook news feeds, 
that will affect their thoughts on 
the election.”

In light of the 2016 presidential 

election 
and 
subsequent 

findingsof 
Robert 
S. 
Mueller 

III, with the special counsel 
investigating 
Russia’s 
electoral 

interference, Facebook has now 
been thrust into the center of a 
national conversation about the 
content-monitoring responsibilities 
of social media platforms.

Even more recently, Facebook 

found 
itself 
embroiled 
in 

controversy 
when 
The 
New 

York Times reported Cambridge 
Analytica, a political firm hired

Two 
dozen 
members 

of Students Allied for Freedom 
and Equalitydemonstrated at 
a lecture by Nadav Tamir, a 
prominent Israeli diplomat, 
Wednesday 
night 
in 
the 

Ford School of Public Policy. 
Tamir’s 
lecture 
marked 

the 
70th 
anniversary 
of 

the 
founding 
of 
Israel, 

but 
protesters 
called 
the 

event 
“ultra 
nationalistic” 

and insensitive in timing, 
pointing to the deaths of 17 
Palestinianprotesters 
who 

were killed in clashes with 
Israel Defense Forces, Israel’s 
military, two weeks ago in 
Gaza.

The demonstrators lined 

the back of the auditorium, 
holding posters condemning 
the IDF, of which Tamir was 
a decorated soldier. Several 
minutes 
into 
the 
lecture, 

three SAFE members staged 
a die-in.

One SAFE member, who 

asked to remain anonymous 
for 
safety 
concerns, 
said 

he 
wanted 
make 
sure 

“Palestinian 
voices 
are 

heard.”

“We wanted to show that 

the people who died in the 
protests and the people who 
have died over the past years 
have not been forgotten,” he 
said. “We felt like this was 
not an appropriate event at 
the 
time, 
especially 
with 

how 
ultra 
nationalistic 
it 

was being portrayed as. We 
wanted to show that there is 
opposition.”

The Frankel Center for 

Judaic Studies, Peres Center 
for 
Peace, 
WolvPAC 
and 

Michigan Hillel co-sponsored 
the lecture. The LSA Center 
for 
Middle 
Eastern 
and 

North 
African 
Studies, 

was previously listed as a 
co-sponsor, but retracted its 
support following complaints 
about the branding of the 
event.

After discrimination lawsuit from A/PIA faculty, UAAO holds panel to discuss resolutions

JORDYN BAKER
Daily Staff Reporter

Two months ago, University 

of 
Michigan 
research 

exposed 
significant 
female 

underrepresentation 
in 

economics. 
Top 
women 

economists convened at the 
Ford 
School 
Wednesday 

afternoon on the topic to 
confirm such discrimination 
and harassment at the highest 
levels of government. They also, 
however, lauded their peers’ 
work therein. The Education 
Policy Initiative of the Ford 
School of Public Policy’s panel 
titled “What female economists 
learned bringing research to 
White House policy making” 
featured a discussion with three 
panelists, all of whom were 
influential female economists 
with extensive experience in 
academia and public policy.

The 
discussion 
was 
led 

by 
Susan 
Dynarski, 
the 

co-director of the Education 
Policy 
Initiative 
and 
a 

professor 
of 
economics, 

education and public policy at 
the University of Michigan. 
The other two panelists were 
Betsey Stevenson, an associate 
professor of public policy, and 
Sandra Black, an economics 
professor at the University of 
Texas, Austin. Stevenson and 
Black both served on the White 
House Council of Economic 
Advisers from 2015 to 2017. All 
three are research associates 
at the National Bureau of 

Economic Research.

The panelists discussed a 

wide range of topics, focusing 
in particular on Stevenson 
and Black’s time at the White 
House. Stevenson and Black 
explained their roles during 
President 
Barack 
Obama’s 

administration and how their 
academic experience informed 
their work.

“One of the core functions 

we do is link the academic 

research to policy — to take 
that research and put it in a 
form that the president and 
policymakers can understand,” 
Black said.

Stevenson and Black also 

discussed the difficulties of 
driving effective policy at the 
federal level, noting economists 
generally hold more centrist 
views than other policymakers 
working in Washington, D.C. 
Their ideas faced opposition at 

some points from congressional 
Democrats, 
who 
wanted 

them to advocate for more 
interventionist 
economic 

policies. 
The 
dynamic 
in 

the field of economics was 
different 
with 
Obama, 
the 

pair 
said, 
praising 
Obama 

for his thoughtful leadership 
and attention to the academic 
research they used in their 
work.

Much 
of 
public 
attention 

on 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
Diversity, 
Equity 

and 
Inclusion 
strategic 

plan 
has 
focused 
on 

the classroom, administration or 
an incendiary stream of bias 
incidents, but students in East 
Quad are engaging with an even 
more every day component of the 
plan: food.

Towards the end of last 

semester, the Hall Council of East 
Quad Residence Hall canceled 
an international food event due 
to complications and concerns 
around cultural sensitivity within 
Michigan Dining. The event now 
serves as a linchpin in changing 
the building’s attitudes towards 
food service and inclusion. 

Abeng Multicultural Council 

Co-Chair Josiah Walker, an LSA 
freshman, said the Hall Council 
director and resident advisers felt 
it was necessary to halt the event.

“(Michigan) Dining took it 

upon themselves to plan the 
food they were going to serve, 
but what happened is they ended 
up mismatching the dishes,” 

East Quad 
dining halls 
to be more 
authentic

GOVERNMENT

Data breach from social 
network results in hearing, 
concerns about privacy

MAEVE O’BRIEN
Daily Staff Reporter


by President Donald Trump’s 
campaign, had access to the private 
data of 50 million Facebook users, 
scaring users who were apart of 
one of the network’s largest data 
breaches.

That 
led 
to 
a 
two-day 

congressional 
hearing, 
which 

ended Tuesday, to gauge just how 
much control Facebook users have 
over their data. No consensus 
in terms of future legislation 
resulted 
from 
the 
hearings, 

though Zuckerberg agreed “some 
regulation” is needed.

Representative Debbie Dingell, 

D-Mich., expressed the frustration 
felt by many University students at 
the hearing.

“Some 
things 
are 
striking 

during this conversation,” she said. 
“As CEO, you didn’t know some 
key facts.”

Facebook said it is weeding out 

fake accounts and news to prepare 

for the 2018 midterm elections and 
prevent its 2016 election mistakes. 
The social media platform is using 
machine learning to identify these 
accounts rather than relying on 
user reports, product manager 
Samidh Chakrabarti said in a 
conference call with Detroit News.

University of Michigan librarian 

Jo Oehrli teaches the class “Fake 
News, Lies, and Propaganda: 
How to Sort Fact from Fiction,” in 
which students learn how to 
identify false or misleading news, 
examine media biases across 
the political spectrum and fact-
check 
information 
found 
in 

articles. Oehrli said people have 
the tendency to view free social 
media platforms as public utilities 
rather than for-profit companies. 
Facebook 
generates 
revenue 

from advertisements, which can 
perpetuate the fake news problem.

“We’re 
in 
this 
in-between 

state right now where we aren’t 
realizing 
that 
these 
(social 

media) companies are for-profit 

companies … ” Oehrli said. “They 
aren’t utility. They are a company 
and even though you don’t pay 
for them, when you sign on for 
the Terms of Service, you are the 
product.”

As part of its anti-fake news 

efforts, Facebook plans to go 
beyond 
fact-checking 
written 

posts and expand into fact-
checking photos and videos. The 
company also plans to create an 
archive in which the public can 
access information about the 
target 
audience 
demographics 

for election-related ads and how 
much money was spent on each of 
the ads.

In 
February, 
Mueller’s 

special 
counsel 
released 
an 

indictment 
that 
confirmed 

Russian agents had been using 
Facebook and other social media 
platforms to disseminate fake 
news and politically persuasive 
messages, 
possibly 
interfering 

with election results.

Trump himself attributed part 

of his success in the election to 
social media platforms such as 
Facebook and Twitter.

“The fact that I have such 

power in terms of numbers 
with 
Facebook, 
Twitter, 

Instagram, etc.,” Trump said 
on CBS’ “60 Minutes.” “I think 
it helped me win all of these 
races where they’re spending 
much more money than I 
spent.”

In an interview with The 

New York Times, Facebook 
CEO Mark Zuckerburg said 
now that the company is 
 

aware of how Facebook was 
abused, they are better able 
to develop the tools necessary 
to prevent it from happening 
again. He said he is assured 
by the elections that have 
happened since 2016, such 
as the French presidential 
election and the Alabama 
special election.

“The new A.I. tools we built 

after the 2016 elections found, 
I think, more than 30,000 fake 
accounts that we believe were 
linked to Russian sources who 
were trying to do the same 
kind of tactics (in France) they 

did in the U.S. in the 2016 election,” 
Zuckerburg said. “We were able 
to disable them and prevent that 
from happening on a large scale in 
France.”

Morse said that given its scope, 

the onus is on Facebook to monitor 
the quality of news content being 
shared on the platform.

“When they create something 

like (Facebook) that has the effects 
that it has on millions and millions 
of people in America, and billions 
of people worldwide, they have a 
responsibility to us as voters, to 
us as citizens, to us just as having 
Facebook accounts, to be honest 
with us, to be upfront about what 
they’re doing with our data, and to 
monitor what goes on on their own 
sites,” Morse said.

For 
those 
who 
work 
on 

political 
campaigns, 
Facebook 

carries potential to influence 
campaigning 
efforts. 
Adam 

Joseph, communications director 
for Abdul El-Sayed’s gubernatorial 
campaign, says the onus is on 
Facebook to prevent the fake news 
circulating on the site.

“The 
revelations 
about 

Facebook are deeply disturbing,” 
Joseph said. “It’s time they accept 
that they have a role in protecting 
our democracy from the fake news 
that threatens its very core.”

The University Chapter of 

College 
Republicans 
did 
not 

respond to requests for comment. 

While Facebook has seemingly 

been the foreground of fake 
news, it has also been a place 
of positive political action and 
community-building. On the end 
of the Facebook users, Oehrli said 
it’s important to approach news 
with a critical eye and review it 
thoroughly before sharing it.

“That’s why we have our own 

critical thinking skills, right?” 
Oehrli said. “If (social media 
companies) are going to be so 
influential and if it’s going to take 
so long for Facebook to catch up 
and try to address this in a way 
through technology, which I’m 
not sure what this will look like, 
we have to use our own critical 
thinking skills and not turn our 
thinking over to the technology or 
to the platform.”

ODISSI DANCE

Sreyashi Dey, founder and artistic director of Srishti Dances of India, hosts an Odissi dance workshop for Michigan Dance students in the Dance 
building Wednesday evening. 

RUCHITA IYER/Daily

Walker said. “They would call a 
special dish ‘Indian food’ even 
though that food could be found 
throughout Southeast Asia. The 
RAs caught wind of this and 
complained to the Hall Director 
and the Hall Director ended up 
shutting it down before they let 
the Multicultural Council know 
about it.”

Walker said he understood 

why 
people 
did 
not 
want 

to 
go 
through 
with 
the 

event. He realized incorrect 
labeling — such as calling a 
multiethnic dish “Indian” —
could result in the exclusion of 
members from other countries in 
Southeast Asia.

“If MDining would have went 

through with it, then it would 
have looked bad for students who 
are from Southeast Asia who 
(would have) walked in and said, 
‘Oh, I have this in my country,’ 
or ‘This is not limited to India,’” 
Walker said. “I wasn’t upset 
about (cancelling the event) 
because the reasoning behind it 
made sense.”

As a member of a multicultural 

council, 
Walker 
emphasized 

the importance of thoroughly 
planning events to involve other 
nationalities so all cultures are 
accurately represented.

“It’s not easy to push for 

multicultural 
events 
because 

you have to take a whole bunch 
of factors into consideration,” 
Walker 
said. 
“You 
have 
to 

make sure you aren’t offending 
anyone and make sure you’re 
being respective of different 
sensitivities.”

MDining 
Marketing 

Coordinator Elliott Rains said he 
appreciated the feedback from 
various East Quad community 
members.

“I know that (MDining) did 

have some meetings with RAs, 
and they did have some concerns 
that it would not be authentic,” 
Rains said. “We always want to 
be respective of the cultures in 
the room and the cultures that 
we serve on a day-to-day basis, 
so anytime people bring to us 
they feel they’re culture is being 
misrepresented, we want to hear 
their concerns. I think that was 
an instance that happened where 
we have some RAs and some 
housing staff members bring 
their concerns to us.”

However, since this incident, 

East Quad has made increased 
efforts 
to 
serve 
quality 

international food. For example, 
this semester, the unit partnered 
with the Office of Student Life 
to begin talks around including 
an improved selection of Middle 
Eastern and North African food 
in dining halls.

Rains explained while the 

increased efforts to serve were 
not in direct response to the 
incident in East Quad, MDining is 
aiming to ensure a more inclusive 
campus environment and worked 
to improve its menus and provide 
authentic food from different 
areas of the world.

“It 
was 
not 
necessarily 

a 
reactionary 
measure; 
it 

was 
something 
that 
we 

have been working on for a 
while,” Rains said. “We have 
internal trainings that we do 
and 
external 
trainings 
that 

we do. I think it just kind of 
compliments the theme that this 
is in an incident where people 
had concerns, and we’re working 
on this at the same time and as 
we’re doing these trainings we 
are getting better at representing 
people’s 
cultures 
and 
 

bringing people recipes that are 
authentic to their culture.”

Director 
of 
Student 

Engagement Keith Soster said 
MDining’s learning objectives 
when researching multicultural 
foods include understanding the 
history of the food, identifying 
ingredients and spices used, 
practicing cooking techniques 
common in ethnic dishes and 
analyzing existing recipes. He 
also 
underscored 
MDining’s 

commitment to DEI initiatives 
through food.

“Researching 
and 
training 

around international authentic 
cuisine speaks to the DEI work 
that we are all embracing on 
campus, and we want to serve food 
that students want and, because 
we have a diverse community, we 
are listening,” Soster said.

Along 
with 
incorporating 

student 
feedback, 
Rains 

explained MDining is working 
with chefs who specialize in 
international cuisines to increase 
the cultural food authenticity. 
Most recently, MDining has 
worked with a chef from India 
and a chef from Japan. The 
dining program has also worked 
with students to create halal, 
plant-based and kosher menus.

“One thing we’re really trying 

to emphasize this year is bringing 
in different perspectives on a lot 
of different things,” Rains said. 
“So last month we brought in a 
chef from India to work on some 
of our Indian recipes, and we also 
brought in a chef from Japan to 
work on some of our Asian and 
Japanese restaurants as well. You 
can bring in as many chefs as you 
want, and I think our chefs are 
learning a lot in these training 
processes. But it’s the student 
feedback we get that is ever 
evolving.”

Though MDining is making 

an 
effort 
to 
improve 
the 

international 
foods 
available 

to students, Walker discussed 
how the exclusive partnership 
between MDining and various 
campus 
buildings 
can 
be 

restrictive in terms of what food 
students can cater for cultural 
events they want to hold.

“In order to get food, we 

have to get it from MCatering 
or from MDining. You can’t 
order outside food, and it is to 
my understanding that they 
do 
not 
offer 
an 
incredible 
 

array 
of 
cultural 
foods,” 
 

Walker said. “The few that they 
do offer, they often don’t cook 
it well, so natives of respective 
countries and cultures complain 
about it.”

East 
Quad 
Hall 
Council 

member Lauren Lee, an LSA 
sophomore, 
noted 
MDining’s 

willingness 
to 
work 
with 

students and take feedback into 
account in response to catering 
complications.

In an email to The Daily, Lee 

wrote she was pleased with 
MDining’s effort to provide 
cultural food.

“MDining still served dishes 

that Hall Council requested 
and really took our feedback 
about this event,” Lee said. “I 
really appreciated them for this 
because we chose this theme and 
we chose a list of countries we 
wanted to see represented.” 

Moving 
forward, 
Walker 

emphasized how he hoped more 
thoughtful research would be 
conducted both on the part 
of multicultural councils and 
MDining to ensure an inclusive 
environment.

“I think that people should 

do 
their 
research 
– 
both 

multicultural 
councils 
and 

dining,” 
Walker 
said. 
They 

should do their research to make 
sure that the food that they’re 
providing under the name of 
the culture they’re providing is 
accurate and inclusive.”

“Even when we lost (a debate), 

the thing that was important to 
me was to know that the views 
we were putting forward at CEA 
were being heard,” Stevenson 
said. “And that was one of the 
things that the president was 
amazing about; he clearly heard 
them.”

Stevenson 
spoke 
about 

efforts to increase the national 
minimum wage while she was 
on the CEA. Obama was unable 
to make progress with Congress, 
but he worked with the CEA 
to raise the wages for some 
government 
workers, 
relying 

heavily on academic research 
showing 
increased 

productivity with higher wages.

The panelists also touched 

on the difficulties of being 
women in the largely male-
dominated field of economics, 
including 
sexual 
harassment 

and 
discrimination. 
They 

discussed ways to combat such 
discrimination, and Stevenson 
said she believes the situation 
will improve if more women 
choose to study economics.

“We have a cultural shift that 

needs to take place,” Stevenson 
said. “And one of the few ways 
to get cultures to shift is to 
change the people in the culture, 
so I do think that improving 
the pipeline and getting more 
women into economics is an 
important part of this.”

Stevenson and Black said the 

gender dynamics in the White 
House were notably better than 
in their previous workplaces. 
Stevenson noted in particular 
there was a wide range of 
representation 
in 
terms 
of 

gender, race, sexual orientation 
and economic status, which she 
said helped greatly with crafting 
policy and opinions.

“There was a lot of diversity, 

and that meant that there was a 
different dynamic,” Stevenson 

said. “There wasn’t a feeling of 
a dominant group. There was a 
feeling of a diverse group. And 
you’re forced to interact in a 
more inclusive way once you’re 
in a really diverse group like 
that.”

Rackham 
student 
Hanna 

Zlotnick, a research assistant for 
the Education Policy Initiative, 
helped organize the event and 
read audience questions to the 
panelists. She also co-authored 
a paper with Stevenson about 
gender 
representation 
in 

economics textbooks.

Zlotnick said she believes 

events like these are a critical 
way for students to learn about 
the work of people in their field.

“It’s really important because 

a lot of people, especially at the 
Ford School, might not have 
the exposure to how the work 
they’re doing in the classroom 
and the work their professors 
are doing is really impacting 
the real world,” Zlotnick said. 
“And all of these professors 

have come from the position of 
both academic research as well 
as being in policy work right 
at the White House. I think it 
shows people that your work 
is influential. It might require 
reframing your work so that the 
general public can see it. … But it 
is really valuable work, and there 
are a lot of people who really 
care.”

Zlotnick also expressed her 

happiness with the sizeable 
crowd that came to see the panel, 
comprised of both University 
students as well as those outside 
of the University.

“It’s great that the general 

public came,” Zlotnick said. 
“Sometimes 
these 
events 

only have Ford students or 
undergraduates 
from 
other 

programs. I always think it’s nice 
when Ann Arbor community 
members 
come 
because 

they’re taking advantage of an 
opportunity to hear from people 
who are really involved in this 
field.”

PANEL
From Page 1

Samer Ali wrote the center was 
“concerned that the event was 
laden with the ultranationalist 
messaging,” particularly the 
phase “In honor of the 70th 
Anniversary of Israel. . .”

“If 
you 
think 
about 
it, 

that equates attending with 
honoring,” Ali wrote. “A truly 
public event open to opposing 
views 
must 
not 
imply 
an 

ideological 
litmus 
test 
for 

participation. In effect, the 
event manufactures consent 
by soliciting a sympathetic 
audience to normalize state-
sponsored 
atrocities, 
while 

excluding those who might 
want to attend for the purposes 
of disagreeing and dissenting 
in a public forum.”

According 
to 
the 
email, 

CMENAS 
was 
unaware 
of 

“the full nature of the event” 
or 
“the 
event’s 
nationalist 

framing” when it initially took 
on co-sponsorship.

Tamir 
is 
currently 
the 

director 
of 
international 

affairs at the Peres Center for 
Peace, an Israel-based non-
governmental 
organization. 

Before his career in diplomacy, 
he served in the IDF as a 

company 
commander 
and 

fought in the First Lebanon 
War, retiring with the rank of 
major.

His lecture focused on the 

possibility of peace between 
Israel and its neighbors in 
the Middle East, including 
Palestine. He discussed how 
the trauma of the Holocaust 
affects Israel’s approach to 
national security and peace 
processes.

“We 
are 
not 
the 
only 

traumatized 
people 
in 
the 

Middle 
East,” 
Tamir 
said. 

“The Palestinians are also 
traumatized for other reasons 
and this is one of the reasons 
why it’s so hard to solve 
this conflict, because you’re 
dealing with two traumatized 
people.”

Tamir 
endorsed 
a 
two-

state solution to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict and called 
for 
immediate 
negotiations 

between the two parties. He 
also said while he was a “die 
hard Zionist,” he was still 
very critical of the Israeli 
government.

“You can love your country 

and be completely against its 
government,” Tamir said. “I 
think many Americans feel that 
they don’t like your president 
at the moment, but are very 

proud to be American.”

An 
LSA 
freshman 
who 

attended the talk and asked not 
to be named said she thought 
Tamir offered an optimistic 
outlook on achieving peace.

“I think that sometimes 

people think that he’s coming at 
from a pro-Israel perspective,” 
she said. “It’s true that he does 
believe in the existence of the 
Israeli state, but what I got 
out of this talk is that he really 
seems to be working toward 
peace in general and he wants 
a win-win solution, not a win-
lose one.”

Tensions between pro-Israel 

and pro-Palestinian student 
groups have simmered since 
Central Student Government’s 
passage 
of 
#UMDivest, 
a 

resolution 
calling 
on 
the 

University to investigate its 
investments 
in 
companies 

committing 
human 
rights 

violations in Israel. 

During 
a 
question 
and 

answer session held after the 
lecture, event facilitators asked 
questions be written down on 
notecards. After reading the 
cards, they would then pose 
questions to Tamir.

After 
several 
rounds 
of 

questions, 
SAFE 
member 

Carly Marten, an LSA junior 
who participated in the die-

in, spoke directly to Tamir 
in reference to Palestinian 
casualties during protests this 
month.

“Literally your organization 

just shot down 700 people 
in Gaza and you want me to 
write down my thoughts on a 
notecard about that?” she said. 
“You are a terrorist. You’ve 
been calling people terrorists 
all day and you yourself work 
for a terrorist organization.”

When 
Tamir 
began 
to 

answer, 
she 
grabbed 
her 

backpack 
and 
left 
the 

auditorium.

LSA sophomore Alex Harris, 

who helped facilitate the event, 
wrote in an email he admired 
how Tamir responded to the 
protesters at the event.

“I was impressed with the 

way Mr. Tamir engaged with 
people with differing opinions 
from his own,” he wrote. 
“He demonstrated that even 
the 
conflicting 
narratives 

surrounding 
the 
Israeli-

Palestinian conflict can be 
bridged through productive 
conversation if we respect 
and acknowledge each other 
and our unique perspectives. I 
believe that this is the only way 
that real, positive change will 
happen.”

SAFE
From Page 1

“Often 
times, 
it’s 
a 
very 

underutilized 
or 
forgotten 

program, (but) has a lot of 
opportunities or benefits that can 
be offered to students of color 
on campus,” Timban said. “So, 
we really just want to be able to 
share that with the community, 
especially 
because 
UAAO 
is 

a space for Asian and Pacific 
Islander students.”

Panelists answered questions 

about their own relationships 
with the program, as well as 
speaking on ways students can 
work to help bolster the program, 
maintain its importance outside 
of the classroom and ensure 

administration 
can 
be 
held 

accountable for its lack of program 
recognition.

Rackham 
student 
Ivy 
Wei 

sat on the panel, explaining her 
own experiences growing up in 
a Midwestern area that lacked 
cultural diversity, speaking on 
the 
importance 
of 
ensuring 

representation in the current 
narrative.

“When I was growing up in the 

Midwest, I really didn’t see any 
cultural or media representations 
of myself,” Wei said. “It’s really 
important for us to reclaim that 
narrative of who we are and what 
we are in society.”

Lawsin 
expressed 
similar 

sentiments, explaining the first 
time she worked with teachers 
and professors who shared her 

cultural identity was when she 
was ethnic studies student. The 
educators provided Lawsin with 
resources to more deeply study 
figures and theories that shaped 
her identity.

“Ethnic studies changed my life 

because for the first time I actually 
had teachers and professors in 
front of me who looked like me 
and I could read about all of these 
people who were like me and 
like my parents and our family,” 
Lawsin said. “I think it’s very 
important for us to realize that 
here in the Midwest, unlike the 
West coast where I grew up, we 
have so few Asian Americans 
in leadership positions, at the 
front of the classroom … or even 
in administrative positions here 
in the University. We have to 

ask, ‘Why? Why is that?’ And I 
think that’s why A/PIA studies is 
important to me, because it allows 
us to look at those things, to study 
those things, and to talk about 
those so we can actually make 
some serious social change.”

The 
beginnings 
of 
Asian-

American studies didn’t come 
without 
conflict, 
Kurashige 

emphasized. 
Protests, 
police 

brutality and riots erupted as 
students in universities began 
demanding 
for 
the 
existence 

of these programs. Even more 
alarming, he noted, is these 
programs were established only 
recently— despite centuries of 
cultural struggles.

“The important thing to realize 

is that the first Asian-American 
studies programs were created 50 

years ago. The student strikes to 
create them started 50 years ago,” 
Kurashige said. “It was because 
people demanded these programs 
… They wanted to change what 
we studied, but they also wanted 
to change the power dynamics in 
education.”

Kurashige further highlighted 

struggles of the A/PIA program 
at the University, noting the 
program currently does not have a 
full staff, a large budget and even 
lacks a sign.

Furthermore, 
Kurashige 

spoke on difficulties with past 
and present LSA deans while 
attempting to make coordinated 
efforts to boost the program. He 
expressed his opinions on the 
faults of administration, noting 
their actions go against A/PIA 

program 
efforts 
to 
increase 

institutional equity.

“There are clear rules as to how 

these programs are governed, 
and when you ask (the deans) for 
the rules, they change them,” 
Kurashige said. “(The programs) 
really set up to fail and the only 
way they can succeed is if you find 
faculty that care enough to devote 
lots of free labor to the University. 
I think the deans need to be held 
accountable for these decisions.”

In addition, panelists spoke on 

the current campus climate and 
necessary changes to promote 
the 
diverse 
atmosphere 
the 

administration advertises.

Reflections on bargain jargon

ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS | COLUMN

ERIK NESLER | COLUMN

J

ournalists 
Mary 
Jordan 
and Scott Clement of The 
Washington Post recently 
wrote a piece on the surge of 
political activism experienced 
throughout 
the 
nation 
in 
response to the Donald Trump 
presidency. 
The 
two 
wrote, 
“One in five Americans have 
protested in the streets or 
participated in political rallies 
since the beginning of 2016. 
Of those, 19 percent said they 
had 
never 
before 
joined 
a 
march or a political gathering.” 
This 
involvement 
is 
both 
unprecedented and inspiring. It 
is also absolutely necessary if we 
want to change the status quo. 
Jordan and Clement attribute 
much of this activism to Trump. 
Whether they love or hate him, 
Americans are playing more 
active roles in our democracy. 
People are actually caring. Even 
if you’re unhappy with Trump, 
something good may come out 
of his presidency.
As I began writing this 
column, I couldn’t help but 
think of a piece written by 
Co-Editorial Page Editor Anu 
Roy-Chaudhury in September 
2016 titled “Maybe we needed 
a Trump.” Though she wrote 
the 
piece 
before 
Trump 
was elected, I believe her 
arguments have become more 
and more relevant with time. 
Roy-Chaudhury 
discussed 
how 
the 
Trump 
candidacy 
had, 
to 
a 
certain 
extent, 
given a voice to previously 
uninvolved 
Americans. 
Trump 
garnered 
significant 
support during the election by 
shining a light on this group 
of individuals — specifically 
people who felt cheated by the 

political 
establishment 
after 
experiencing 
great 
hardship 
as a result of the advancing 
economy. These members of our 
society, who Roy-Chaudhury 
properly labeled “neighbors,” 
deserve to be heard.
Since the election, people 
have turned to books like 
“Hillbilly Elegy” by J.D. Vance 
in an attempt to understand 
what life is like for these 
displaced 
Americans. 
Vance 
gives us a slight glimpse into the 
lives of this highly marginalized 
group of individuals. Even if 
you disagree with their political 
ideologies and beliefs, it is 
important to be aware of what 
our neighbors are feeling.
However, Trump has given 
more than just this group a 
voice. He has prompted all sorts 
of people to speak their mind 
and 
become 
more 
involved 
in 
politics. 
The 
Women’s 
March, a protest that sprung 
up 
immediately 
following 
Trump’s inauguration and has 
become a global phenomenon, 
is a powerful force advocating 
not only for women’s rights 
and gender equality but also 
for racial equality and LGBTQ 
rights. The recent March for 
Our Lives demonstrations that 
called for tighter gun control 
also 
reveal 
the 
heightened 
political activism experienced 
throughout the nation.
Protesting is one way people 
are showing their discontent 
with the current status quo. 
Deciding to attend may seem 
trivial, but protests can have 
lasting 
effects: 
Suffragists 
marched for the passage of the 
19th amendment, and protesters 
pushed along the Civil Rights 

movement. 
People 
are 
also 
taking more behind-the-scenes 
political action by contributing 
to or volunteering for certain 
campaigns. I volunteered for a 
local campaign my first year at 
the University of Michigan, and 
it was one of the most rewarding 
experiences I have had in my 
undergraduate career. You don’t 
need to be out protesting to 
make a difference.
The 
Trump 
presidency 
has 
also 
prompted 
an 
unprecedented 
number 
of 
women to run for seats in the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
in 
this 
upcoming 
midterm 
election; there are currently 
548 female candidates that will 
be campaigning in the coming 
months. Despite making up 
just over half of the population, 
women make up only 20 percent 
of Congress. I hope this surge 
in 
the 
number 
of 
women 
candidates can bring about a 
more balanced Congress. 
Though 
I 
disapprove 
of 
Trump, 
I 
acknowledge 
his 
presidency may be advantageous 
to our democracy in the long run. 
We need more and more people 
getting 
involved 
politically, 
especially 
considering 
that 
40 percent of eligible voters 
haven’t voted in the most recent 
presidential elections.
Instead of sitting idly by for 
another election, Trump has 
motivated scores of people to 
take action to change the status 
quo. Maybe Trump isn’t so bad 
after all. To echo Anu Roy-
Chaudhury, maybe we needed 
a Trump.

I

write this on Monday, April 
9, the day that the Lecturers’ 
Employee Organization was 
initially going to begin its work 
strike, protesting the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
hypocrisy 
and greed in their ongoing 
bargaining negotiations.
Before I provide my take on 
this movement, with which I have 
become pretty involved over the past 
several weeks, I want to provide some 
statistics. Right now, the minimum 
salary for a lecturer is $34,500 in 
Ann Arbor, $28,300 in Dearborn 
and $27,300 in Flint. Lecturers 
frequently work second and third 
jobs — as baristas, Uber drivers or 
teachers at other schools — to make 
a livable wage.
On Feb. 12, in its first salary 
counterproposal, the University 
offered a $1,000 increase in 2019, a 
$750 increase in 2020 and a $500 
increase in 2021. On March 23, in 
its second counterproposal, the 
University offered to increase 
minimum salaries by $2,000 in 
2019 and 2020, providing 2.25 
percent annual raises over three 
years in Ann Arbor, but giving 
nothing at all to lecturers already 
making 
above 
the 
minimum 
salaries. Finally, in its third 
counterproposal March 28, the 
University offered a $5500 starting 
salary increase for lecturers only 
in Ann Arbor, while offering no 
new negotiations for either of the 
University’s other two campuses.
And then, last night, the 
University 
offered 
a 
$10,000 
increase in minimum salary wages 
in Ann Arbor and a $7,500 increase 
in Dearborn and Flint. This was the 
most significant movement with 
respect to salary so far, so LEO 
decided not to strike and to continue 
bargaining, with the hopes that they 
now have the necessary momentum 
to move forward.
I provide this timeline to 
convince 
you 
of 
one 
crucial 
fact: The University’s ostensibly 
benevolent move Sunday night was 
not anything besides it realizing it 
cannot continue to disrespect its 
lecturers. A strike would make bad 
optics at this school, which loves 
more than anything else to tout 
its legacies and its traditions, as it 
prepares to celebrate the annual 
Commencement ceremonies. This 

shift in the bargaining only took 
place because of the tireless efforts 
of LEO and its allies who have 
consistently 
packed 
bargaining 
rooms and organized a substantial 
campaign effort on all three U-M 
campuses. Please, in trying to 
understand why this happened, 
focus on the grassroots work that 
has happened to force the hands of 
our administrators.
Now, a few reflections on my 
experiences as an ally working 
with 
LEO. 
These 
bargaining 
meetings are incredible affairs to 
take part in. Here’s why: The work 
going on at the bargaining table is 
extremely boring. We, the allies — 
lecturers, people’s families, etc. — 
sit in chairs set up for us with our 
computers and notebooks in hand, 
passing the time, looking up now 
and then to see what’s going on, 
feeling frustrated that we cannot 
hear anything or, even when we 
can, that we cannot understand 
the bargain jargon, inhaling a 
rush of body odor pouring off 
of us in this humid, disgusting 
room, wondering why someone 
can’t just open a window and 
then ultimately returning to our 
homework with a wry smile as we 
look around at all of the friends 
with whom we sit, knowing we 
are in solidarity, knowing we are 
on the right side of history.
My 
experiences 
at 
these 
bargaining meetings — along with 
the gradual progress the various 
grassroots protest demonstrations 
have created — have furthermore 
taught me another crucial fact: 
Protest is often boring. It often 
takes place in crowded, sweaty 
rooms where nothing is officially 
happening. Where the task is to 
wait — nothing glamorous or loud 
or spectacular to show for it. Just 
a bunch of smelly people crowded 
together in a bland, fluorescently lit 
room who have decided to attend 
this meeting out of a sense that how 
we treat our lecturers represents 
how this University, in practice 
— as opposed to all of the chit-
chat about the Leaders and Best 
— fosters inclusive, egalitarian, 
participatory community.
Family 
members 
shared 
stories about why they need their 
spouses to earn more money 
for 
their 
newly-born 
child. 

Tenured professors offered heart-
wrenching 
testimonies 
about 
their colleagues. Students whose 
University experiences have been 
fundamentally 
transformed 
by 
lecturers told their own stories. 
And, of course, lecturers themselves 
described the everyday struggles 
into which the University has 
forced them.
For 
all 
skeptics 
of 
this 
movement, I suggest going to an 
open bargaining meeting. I suggest 
speaking to these lecturers and 
their allies about this movement, 
about what it means to them. I 
suggest hearing their stories, so as 
to humanize the people whose lives 
are at stake.
This is my last column for The 
Daily, because I’m graduating in a 
few weeks, and I would just like to 
say these experiences have made me 
proud to be part of this community. 
They’ve taught me education does 
not need a classroom or a university 
to support it; in fact, these deeply 
educational experiences have taken 
place as a university specifically 
tries to suppress them.
We 
can 
make 
our 
own 
education in small, unexpected 
(humid, 
sweaty) 
pockets. 
We 
can form our own communities, 
working against or outside of any 
institutional affiliation. It seems 
like this is the direction life heads 
toward now: finding solidarity 
and community on our own terms, 
knowing it can take place and grow 
in surprising ways and places.
Living life curiously, open to 
this possibility. It all comes back 
to perception: As Henry David 
Thoreau wrote, “I know of no 
more encouraging fact than the 
unquestionable ability of (a person) 
to elevate (their) life by conscious 
endeavor.”
Join a movement you believe 
in, invest in the community that 
movement creates, look around 
and, despite the sweat and the 
humidity and the stubborn, cruel 
administrators trying to stamp you

Emasculation and “yellow fever”
A

s 
children, 
my 
friends 
and I used to watch TV 
shows, usually produced 
by 
Nickelodeon 
and 
Disney 
Channel. Some of our favorites 
included “Hannah Montana” and 
“Drake and Josh.” We idolized the 
characters and the actors who 
played them, and, of course, with 
such media consumption came 
childhood crushes. From what I 
remember, glossy posters of teenage 
heartthrobs Jesse McCartney and 
Justin Bieber covered many girls’ 
bedroom walls. The “Twilight” 
craze that came later resulted in 
perhaps one of the most talked 
about debates for not just teenagers, 
but all fans of the franchise: Team 
Edward or Team Jacob?
However, as far as I can 
remember, there were no Asian 
characters, other than the occasional 
extra who served a role that fulfilled 
stereotypes, such as a “math nerd.” 
There 
certainly 
wasn’t 
anyone 
worthy of having a crush on.
This kind of limited and often 
flat portrayal of Asians bolsters the 
message that all Asians are damned to 
be “nerdy” and weak. This depiction 
of Asians aligns with a general 
consensus in American society that 
Asian people are not attractive, or 
are attractive for reasons rooted in 
disgusting and untrue stereotypes. 
These messages are not only false 
but perpetuate harmful stereotypes 
about Asians that homogenize them. 
Interestingly enough, Asian men 
and Asian women are defined by 
differing stereotypes, with Asian 
men often emasculated and Asian 
women fetishized.
Steve Harvey mocked Asian men 
on his talk show in early 2017 by first 
stating no woman would ever want 
to date a man of Asian descent and 
then asking, “You like Asian men? I 
don’t even like Chinese food, boy. It 
don’t stay with you no time. I don’t 
eat what I can’t pronounce.” He later 
apologized for his comments on 
Twitter, claiming the “humor was not 
meant with any malice or disrespect 
whatsoever.” It’s interesting to note 
he believed stating that all men of 
Asian descent are not attractive 
would not be offensive. Is it so deeply 
ingrained in society that Asian men 

are not attractive that it’s not even 
considered to be offensive to joke 
about it? Obviously, that’s not the 
case for everyone, since Harvey’s joke 
received backlash for its insensitivity.
In a New York Times op-ed 
titled “Hey, Steve Harvey, Who Says 
I Might Not Steal Your Girl?” Eddie 
Huang, the writer of TV series “Fresh 
Off the Boat,” wrote, “Attractiveness 
is a very haphazard dish that can’t be 
boiled down to height or skin color, 
but Asian men are told that regardless 
of what the idyllic mirepoix is or isn’t, 
we just don’t have the ingredients.” 
He further discussed how after 
hearing Harvey’s jokes, he “told 
(himself) that it was all a lie, but the 
structural emasculation of Asian men 
in all forms of media became a self-
fulfilling prophecy that produced an 
actual abhorrence to Asian men in 
the real world.”
In 
contrast, 
Asian 
women 
are fetishized for their supposed 
heightened femininity, and such 
a perception has birthed the term 
“yellow fever.” Yellow fever is when 
men, often Caucasian, have a strong 
sexual preference for East Asian 
women. This offensive exoticization 
of Asian women can be seen both 
in media and in everyday life: the 
musical “Miss Saigon,” which depicts 
a tragic love story between a white 
U.S. GI and Kim, a South Vietnamese 
bar girl, supports stereotypes that 
Asian women are docile and weak. 
Tim Teeman reveals in “Sexism, 
Race and the Mess of ‘Miss Saigon’ 
on Broadway” Kim is represented 
as a woman who lacks agency, 
stating “Kim’s solo songs … are ones 
of sacrifice and the impossibility of 
dreams or love being fulfilled. She 
is often lying down, looking up and 
cowering. The one moment where 
she takes action against a villain 
gets a resounding cheer — and she 
is only then protecting her son.” 
Kim’s depiction in “Miss Saigon” 
exemplifies widespread beliefs in 
America that while Asian women can 
be beautiful, their beauty only comes 
from their supposed weakness and 
ability to “take care” of others.
Such characterizations affect 
Asian women in everyday life, and 
these effects are not limited to the 
United States. In an article from 

the British paper The Telegraph 
titled “‘Yellow fever’ fetish: Why 
do so many white men want to date 
a Chinese woman?” writer Yuan 
Ren explains how she is affected by 
stereotypes. She writes, “I’ve heard 
my Caucasian friends recommend 
to their male, single mates that they 
should date ‘nice Chinese girls,’ 
with the added bonus that Chinese 
women are far more sexually open-
minded 
than 
Caucasian 
girls.” 
She also mentions one interaction, 
writing, “One acquaintance told me 
in wonderment that Chinese women 
are great in the bedroom — as if I 
wasn’t one — to being casually asked 
if I’d be interested in a guy ‘who has 
been with Chinese girls and likes it.’” 
These interactions took place in the 
United Kingdom, but similar ones 
exist in other places as well.
The media’s portrayal of Asian 
people homogenizes a diverse group 
of people who are resilient, and yes, 
attractive. Promoting stereotypes 
about Asian people, unintentionally 
or not, only serves to further alienate 
Asian people from American society 
by establishing them as an “other” 
defined solely by untrue stereotypes. 
I’ve seen this type of behavior in 
my life, with people automatically 
assuming I must be uninteresting and 
bookish because I’m Asian-American, 
as well as people emasculating my 
Asian-American male peers. People 
expect me to by shy and docile, when 
they don’t expect such characteristics 
of people who aren’t Asian, and are 
surprised when they find out I am 
neither. Such preconceived notions 
about people of Asian descent are 
unfounded and need to stop being 
perpetuated.
Asian men are attractive, and it is 
through their strength that they are 
able to achieve success in a society 
that tells them that they are not good-
looking or interesting enough. Asian 
women are not sexual objects meant 
to cater to men’s sexual fantasies and 
they possess powerful agency. It is 
time that the media treats people of 
Asian descent with respect and create 
a truthful depiction of what it means 
to be Asian.

Doolittle, Pixies
Doolittle by the Pixies stands 

as one of the most influential 
rock records since its release in 
1989. It moves through poppy 
instrumentals 
with 
perfect 

bass lines that contrast its dark 
subject 
matter 
referencing 

biblical violence, surrealism and 
death.

These things melt into one 

cohesive album that conjure up an 
unsettling feeling, and Doolittle’s 
iconic album cover gives those 
feelings a face. Frontman Francis 
Black gave the album’s lyrics to 
photographer Simon Larbalestier 
and 
artist 
Vaughan 
Oliver, 

allowing them to make images 
directly related to the songs. 
They produced multiple images: 
everything from a stark black 
and white photograph of a crab 
and broken boot to represent the 
mentioned crustaceans on “Wave 
of Mutilation” to a chipped, 
broken bell that queues the 
“ringing bell” in “I Bleed.”

After 
much 
pondering, 

Black chose the uncanny and 
memorable image of the monkey 
with a halo on its head under a 
layer of odd geometric shapes. 
The image recalls the song 
“Monkey Gone To Heaven,” as 
Black’s harsh voice gives purpose 
to the three numbers branded 

on the cover: 
five, six and 
seven. 
Black 

sings, “If man 
is five / Then 
the Devil is 
six / And if 
the Devil is 
six 
/ 
Then 

God is seven,” 
with a gut-
wrenching 
shriek 
emphasized 
on “God” that 
lingers in your 
eardrums.

In 
a 

Consequence 
of Sound review, they mention 
a quote by Black explaining that 
“Mr. Grieves” is about Death 
in mythology. A line in the 
songs references Dr. Doolittle 
embodying 
Death 
because 

they are both people who pass 
through 
multiple 
planes 
of 

existence. Black says, “The ‘man 
in the middle’ is Dr. Doolittle, 
because if you could speak to 
the animals you would be the 
great link between mankind 
and the animal world,” making 
the monkey a symbol of the 
otherworldly.

The cover has a distinct feeling 

of distortion with its grey and red 

colors. They match the rustic 
tone of Black’s voice throughout 
the record, especially in songs 
like “Dead,” when his voice seeps 
into a indistinguishable abyss 
of sound as he sings, “You’re 
suffocating you need a good 
shed / I’m tired of living, shebe, 
so gimme / Dead.” The record’s 
constant references to death and 
things beyond paired with the 
creepy cover pushes listeners 
into a curious middle ground 
of light and darkness melting 
together in entropy.

Roundtable: on the importance of album cover art 

Yeezus, Kanye West
Yeezus: The anti-cover. What 

better feature for our series 
about cover art than an album 
with no cover at all? For his sixth 
studio album, established hip-
hop innovator Kanye West took 
a step toward the avant-garde, 
bringing the design of its cover 
with him. The Yeezus “cover” is 
best discussed in terms of a CD 
and case, as the digital version 
is simply an image of the two: 
With no design aside from a small 
square of red sealant tape, the 
physical Yeezus disc is completely 
exposed through its clear, plastic 

packaging. 
It’s 
minimalist, 
it’s raw and 
instead 
of 

augmenting 
an 
album’s 

innate 
qualities 
of 
mass-

production 
and 
digitization 
with life and 
creativity 
as 
album 

art 
typically 

aims to do, it 
completely 

embraces the album’s CD-ness.

Ironically, 
these 
characteristics 

(or lack thereof) brilliantly mimic 
the tone of the album. Sonically, 
Yeezus differs drastically from 
Ye’s 
traditionally 
warm 
and 

polished sound, instead offering 
a chaotic array of unfiltered, 
digital mush. Its tracks are cold, 
abrasive 
and 
overwhelmingly 

artificial — attributes that a plain, 
metallically reflective compact 
disc perfectly embodies. For 
example, “On Sight” is both parts 
a jarring imitation of Afrika 
Bambaataa’s condensed electro 
beats of the ’80s and a brilliant 

example of the power of gospel 
sampling, either section starkly 
contrasted without traditional 
regard for blend or balance; “I’m 
In It” boasts a gigantic, angry 
beat that could be classified as 
some corelary of rap metal with 
ear-piercing screeches to match. 
It’s only appropriate that the 
album’s cover breaks the mold as 
well.

In 2013, Ye ranted about Yeezus 

and its cover: “With this album 
we ain’t drop no single to radio. 
We ain’t got no NBA campaign, 
nothing like that. Shit, we ain’t 
even got no cover. We just made 
some real music.” Disgruntled 
with the state of the music 
industry in 2013, viewing pop 
radio as uninspired, Ye indicated 
that an additional motivation for 
a coverless album was to recenter 
focus strictly on the album’s 
content. This was an especially 
strong decision given that Yeezus 
is difficult to digest upon first 
listen; any additional art would 
have made the record’s dark 
experimentation overwhelming 
and unpalatable. Instead, Yeezy 
let the CD speak for itself.

MUSIC

Music writers of Daily Arts understand the importance that lies within an attractive binding and how an album’s cover can offer 
a glimpse of the story its music contains. Thus, in no particular order, we have compiled a list of our favorite works of album art.

4AD

Revolver, The Beatles 
Prior to Revolver, Beatles 

album covers had been fairly 
straightforward photos of the 
four members, and although 
Rubber Soul did feature a 
marijuana-fueled 
distortion 

of their faces, Revolver was 
still a major departure. The 
cover 
consists 
of 
drawings 

of the Fab Four rather than 
photographs, 
intermingled 

with a psychedelic collage in 
black and white, which was a 
subversive artistic decision in 
an era where intense color was 
de rigueur. This was the cover 
art of a band who had begun to 
take their work more seriously, 
certain now that this was not 
just pop music — it was art.

Paul had immersed himself 

in the London avant-garde 
scene, 
devouring 
anything 

hip 
and 
interesting, 
from 

Stockhausen to cocaine. This 

included tape loop collages 
— a sonic innovation that 
would find its way onto the 
ultra-experimental 
closer 

“Tomorrow 
Never 
Knows” 

(and in a much more extreme 
form on John’s “Revolution 9” 
a few years later). On the cover 
Paul is looking outward, much 
like how he spent the Revolver 
era 
searching 
for 
external 

inspiration, synthesizing the 
innovations of his time with 
The 
Beatles’ 
pre-existing 

musical sensibilities (visually 
reflected in how the old images 
of The Beatles are melded with 
the nouveau illustration of 
Klaus Voormann).

John, 
conversely, 
had 

become 
reclusive 
— 
eating 

acid, watching TV and idling in 
Ringo’s garden. His withdrawn 
and 
contrary 
worldview 

emerged in songs like “I’m Only 
Sleeping” and “And Your Bird 

Can 
Sing,” 

and is also 
reflected 
in 
the 

subversive 
black 
and 

white cover 
art. 
When 

most 
were 

moving 
towards 
technicolor 
psychedelia, 
The Beatles 
eschewed 
color 
altogether. 
Lennon’s 
gaze on the 

cover is shifty-eyed and his face 
is partially obscured, looking 
with near-condescension at the 
older images of the mop-top 
Beatles, an era he was soon to 
reject.

George is the only Beatle to be 

looking directly at the viewer, 
coming into his own creatively 
on the record from his original 
pieces 
(in 
particular, 
the 

Indian-influenced “Love You 
To”) to his scorching guitar 
parts on songs like “She Said 
She Said” and “And Your Bird 
Can Sing.” The quiet Beatle 
began to find his voice on 
Revolver, and his intense gaze 
on the cover suggests that he 
intends to be heard.

Finally, 
Ringo 
is 
gazing 

upwards, 
a 
receptive 
pose 

befitting the Beatle whose role 
was to support the others on 
their creative journey — his 
drum-playing never missing 
a beat — despite the fact that 
he himself never instigated 
any of this development, from 
his 
brain-crushing 
thumps 

on “Tomorrow Never Knows” 
to 
his 
intense 
technical 

performance on “She Said She 
Said.”

The cover of Revolver is 

emblematic not just because 
it is visually engaging, but 
because it captures the spirit 
and sound of the album. It is the 
audacious epitome of a moment 
when The Beatles made their 
biggest leap from pop icons to 
art musicians.

Seek Magic, Memory Tapes
I first came across Seek Magic 

during Mar. of my senior year of 
high school. I was a Future Islands 
fanatic — some things never 
change — and my obsession with 
the band set me down a winding 
path that ultimately led to ’70s and 
’80s inspired synth-pop revival 
and doused-out chill wave in 
equal measure. I was knee-deep 
in the youth lagoon, if you will, 
encountering 
Twin 
Shadow, 

Chromatics, 
Wild 
Nothing, 

Washed Out, Craft Spells and 
Neon Indian for the first time.

Somehow, 
maybe 
through 

Spotify’s 
“Related 
Artists” 

feature or a 2009 “Best Of” list, 
I stumbled upon Memory Tapes 
and Seek Magic caught my eye. 
The album’s cover art could be 
mistaken for a sun or water-
damaged photograph from afar, 
but it’s actually a painting, though 
it’s difficult to tell what of.

I’ve tried many times over 

the past three years to find 
information on the cover’s artist, 
but never succeeded. Memory 
Tapes has a Bandcamp page, but 
Seek Magic is glaringly absent, 
and the album’s Wikipedia page 
is about as helpful. Left to my own 
devices, I have always imagined 
that the artist’s goal was to 
challenge the border between the 
above and the below, the sea and 
the sky.

What seem to be clouds line the 

top of the image, while the lower 
two thirds consist of reflective 
strips, like inconsistent little pools 
of oil whose iridescence causes 

their reflections to be unfaithful 
replications 
of 
reality. 
The 

centerpiece of the cover is plain 
to see but difficult to describe. 
Intuition tells me that it’s an 
island — a distant one, certainly — 
either peeking out from the water 
or hanging in midair. Whatever 
the case may be, the sum total of 
the landscape’s features seems to 
represent a magical half-reality, 
suitable given the album’s dreamy 
feel.

“Swimming Field,” the album’s 

first cut, begins with the sound 
that insects make in the night at 
warmer latitudes. The familiar 
drone of bugs is punctuated by 
a dog’s bark even further in the 
background — you might miss it if 
you’re not listening on headphones. 
The effect is immediate nostalgia 
at its purest and most intense, and 
a feeling of space, like walking 
down 
an 

empty street 
somewhere 
in coastal Fla.. 
There’s 
no 

sidewalk, but 
no cars either, 
so you amble 
along the side 
of the road, 
appreciating 
more 
than 

usual 
both 

the 
light 

provided 
by 

street lamps 
and the space 
in 
between 

them.

While the 

album art alone might not merit 
the recognition I’ve given it, the 
interplay between the visual and 
aural within this album especially 
has always stuck with me. Lyrics 
are subdued throughout, and the 
general mood is one of longing. For 
me, this has always meant longing 
for the past, for simplicity and the 
space to not feel so bad about being 
lazy. This idea of the past as being 
perfectly simple isn’t an accurate 
one though, thoroughly colored by 
rosy retrospection. Seek Magic’s 
fantastical landscape is analogous 
to the places that populate my 
memories. It exists as they exist, 
certainly there but not quite real, 
tantalizing and comforting in that 
I can never quite return to the 
place I recall, because I was never 
actually there.

The Kick Inside, Kate Bush 
The UK release cover of 

The Kick Inside by ethereal 
songstress 
Kate 
Bush 
has 

always 
been 
one 
of 
my 

favorite examples of album 
art, from the moment I first 
saw it to every time it comes 
up on my phone to this day. 
A stark yellow background 
embellished with red details, 
the cover exudes the brilliant 
life of the record’s contents — 
the debut album for Bush and 
the first chance the world had 
to experience her genius. In 
the artwork, Bush appears to 
be exploding out of a watchful 
eye on a sail of fire, surrounded 
by swirling Chinoiserie fabric 
and a title written out in 
careful calligraphy. The bright 
contrast between the red and 
yellow of the cover shows the 
lively and beautifully alien 
aspects of Bush’s work in one 
glance, as each portion of the 
art works together in a strange 
yet innovative manner. If there 
was anything to describe The 
Kick Inside, that would be 
it: 
strange, 
yet 
innovative. 

Carrying her top single and 
most memorable song from the 
album, “Wuthering Heights,” 
the album was released to 
international acclaim, yet this 
haunting cover art did not go 
with it everywhere. The United 
States release of The Kick Inside 
instead bares just a photo 
of Bush comfortably sitting, 
wearing jeans and a red blouse, 
supposedly 
more 
appealing 

to an American audience who 
wasn’t 
so 

adapted 
to 

the intrigue 
of 
Bush’s 

artistic 
sensibilities. 
Nonetheless, 
the UK cover 
became the 
accepted 
version 
of 

the 
album, 

and 
its 

longevity 
has carried 
Bush’s 
wonderful 
weirdness 
into 
the 

hands of many since its release. 
This is a record you can truly 
judge by its cover, because the 
art is a perfect replication of 
what lays within — a lasting 
and memorable show of a 
young Bush’s prodigal talent 
and “it” factor which echoes 
into the present.

Melodrama, Lorde
When I think of the summer 

of 2017, I think of driving and 
I think of Lorde’s Melodrama. 
My first time listening to the 
album in full was during my 
daily commute from home to 
campus, where I was taking 
classes for the summer. The 
most vivid memory I have of 
that experience is hearing 
“Homemade Dynamite” float 
through my car speakers like 
some sort of chilling dream: 
“We’ll end up painted on the 
road / Red and chrome / All 
the broken glass sparkling.”

Most 
of 

the 
albums 

I listen to 
are 
black 

and red, not 
just in color 
scheme, 
but also in 
tone. 
More 

often 
than 

not, 
artists 

will 
fixate 

on a single 
emotion, 
weaving 
it 

in and out of 
every single 
track 
until 

it positively 

blots 
out 
everything 
else, 

which 
doesn’t 
leave 
much 

room for nuance. Take My 
Chemical 
Romance’s 
Three 

Cheers 
for 
Sweet 
Revenge; 

although the pace changes 
slightly from song to song, 
anyone who isn’t particularly 
into the genre might not be 
able to pick apart the tiny 
differences that separate the 
individual tracks. My favorite 
part about Melodrama is how 
complete it is: There’s a song 
for every single emotion on 
the spectrum. Underlying it 
all is a somber, brilliant blue 

that Lorde somehow manages 
to balance just right. There’s 
the slow, heartbreaking build 
of “Liability” that renders 
it Melodrama’s ultimate sad 
song, 
contrasted 
with 
the 

dramatized, deceptively bright 
“Green Light” and the heart-
racing, free-falling beat that 
drives “Perfect Places.” The 
vivid brights of Melodrama’s 
album art are the sights to 
the sound, the precise visual 
manifestation of how much 
of herself Lorde puts into her 
work.

On 
Melodrama, 
Lorde 

condenses 
the 
essence 
of 

teenage relationships in all 
of their turbulent glory, from 
the before to the during to the 
after, and does it all without 
abandon. She leaves us with a 
final parting gift: an image of 
her at her most striking, when 
she’s 
unflinchingly 
staring 

right at the viewer.

This past Thursday, I attended 

a performance of the School of 
Music, Theater & Dance’s “Angels 
in America” written by Tony 
Kushner. It was an incredibly 
intense experience. While I am 
still not sure what the play was 
trying to convey, I am sure that it 
is an important message.

As soon as I got home from 

the play, I set out trying to find 
different 
interpretations 
of 

the play online. The dominant 
theme, as I learned, was the idea 
of 
community 
and 

the 
groupings 
that 

separate members of 
a larger community. 
This interpretation is 
backed by Kushner’s 
assertion 
that 
“the 

question I am trying 
to ask is how broad is a 
community’s embrace. 
How wide does it 
reach?” He claims the 
work focuses on the 
boundaries 
between 

communities 
and 

identities in American 
culture, 
particularly 

during the Reagan years.

To me, however, this thematic 

concept is wholly inadequate in 
describing the significance and 
meaning of the play. This concept 
is the driving force behind the 
play, the lifeblood of its plot. But 
it does not explain the questions 
that the play raises or the 
messages that it delivers about 
contemporary culture. At no point 
did I find myself questioning the 
breadth of a community’s reach or 
the intersection and limitations of 
these communities. If anything, 
the contraction of communities 
occurring throughout the play was 
predictable from the beginning, 
the 
boundaries 
between 

communities already having been 
clearly defined by the audience’s 
preconceptions. 
The 
divisions 

based on race, ethnicity and sexual 
orientation, for example, conform 
neatly to what one would expect of 
society during the Reagan years.

What then, I asked myself, was 

the meaning of the play? This was 
four days after I had attended the 
performance. I had been thinking 
about the play almost constantly in 
that time, and yet I was no closer 
to reaching an answer to this 
question than I had been when I 
left the theater. If anything, I found 
myself moving farther and farther 
away from a coherent answer. 
I had rejected political themes 
(too restrictive to the Reagan 
years); I rejected racial, ethnic and 
cultural themes (too narrow to 
fully encompass the religious and 
political allusions in the play); and 
I rejected religious themes (too 
infrequent and inconsequential 
to the plot as a whole). I had only 
been able to reject themes that I 
knew were incorrect. I was yet 
to find an answer that I found 
convincing: an understanding of 
the play that would finally allow 
me to stop thinking about it.

To this end, I was reminded of 

one of my favorite plays, Samuel 
Beckett’s monumental “Waiting 
for Godot.” This work, and the 
enigma surrounding the work, 
has always fascinated me. On 
the surface, the play is incredibly 
simple, almost laughably so. The 
dialogue can be prohibitively 
confusing when one first hears it 
— the rapid, illogical conversations 
easier to reject as meaningless 
than to accept as holding some 
meaning. It is not uncommon 
to hear laughter when one first 
witnesses the work, the bizarre 
nature of the dialogue provoking 
an immediate, though perhaps 
uninformed, response.

The more that one begins to 

analyze and pull apart “Waiting 
for Godot,” the more that the 
various intersecting ideas and 
interpretations of the work begin 
to venture out from below this 
seemingly 
humorous 
surface. 

On 
Wikipedia, 
interpretations 

of the work fall under many 
categories: 
Freudian, 
Jungian, 

existential, 
ethical, 
Christian, 

autobiographical and even sexual. 
Each one of these interpretations 
capture some aspects of the 
play but none have ever been 

universally 
accepted 
as 
a 

primary, or most correct and all-
encompassing interpretation.

I first analyzed the piece in 

my high school A.P. Literature 
class. Given the level of this class, 
we chose to use the religious 
interpretation 
of 
the 
work. 

Godot’s name was taken as proof 
of the God-like symbolism of this 
character. We spoke about the 
loss of faith in the interwar and 
post-World-War 
generations, 

trying to connect Godot’s absence 

throughout the play 
with 
the 
questions 

being 
raised 
about 

God and the role of 
God in 20th-century 
Europe.

While 
this 

interpretation suited 
the class quite well, it 
never quite satisfied 
my 
understanding 

of the play. Beckett 
himself was reported 
to 
have 
explained 

that the play is “all 
symbiosis.” 
Ignoring 

the questions of the 

authenticity that surround this 
quote, I have always found the 
very idea of symbiosis as the 
focus of the play to be unhelpful 
and unsatisfying. How can an 
entire play be about symbiosis? 
Is symbiosis not a basic aspect of 
the human condition? What can 
be gained from understanding 
the play as revolving around 
symbiosis?

As I have continued to analyze 

these two complex works of 
theater, I have slowly begun to 
understand that their complex, 
illusory 
meanings 
are 
what 

make them so engaging. In all 
my conversations about “Angels 
in America” I have never once 
found myself holding the same 
understanding of the play that I 
did before. And whenever I chose 

to revisit “Waiting for Godot” 
I find new thematic ideas and 
cultural references that lead me in 
different interpretive directions.

Fully 
understanding 
a 

magnificent 
piece 
of 
art 
is 

impossible. 
One 
cannot 
help 

but 
see 
one’s 
ever-changing 

perspectives 
and 
experiences 

reflected in art. One cannot help 
but see in art what one wants to 
find, the various interpretations 
of the piece slowly drifting 
to the surface of one’s own 
interpretation.

Though I still do not fully 

understand Kushner’s “Angels 
in America,” I am confident that 
I need not understand it to fully 
comprehend its beauty. Though 
I am no closer to understanding 
“Angels in America” than I 
was when I first witnessed the 
work, it is the constant journey 
to understand art, and not my 
theoretical final interpretation, 
that gives it beauty. Beauty can be 
found in confusion and confusion 
in beauty. It is the road through 
confusion to finding this beauty 
that gives art its value, and the 
ever-receding end of this road that 
gives art its timelessness and its 
intrigue.

Beauty of ‘Angels 
in America’ lies 
in the confusion

TV REVIEW
‘Vice’ explores juvenile justice in 
a moving sixth season premiere

The real tragedy of juvenile 

incarceration is that it robs 
children of everything we hold 
dear about youth: all of the 
innocence, all of the freedom 
to dream, all of the joy. Early in 
“Raised in the System,” the first 
episode of the sixth season of the 
gritty HBO newsmagazine series 
“Vice,” an incarcerated young 
man named Jabar says of the first 
time he was locked up, “I was 15 
years old. Five years before that, 
I was believing in Santa Claus.” 
It’s both a haunting remark and a 
recurring theme throughout this 
sophisticated, revelatory look at 
the juvenile justice system.

Vice Media’s documentaries 

have cultivated a bit of a 
reputation for sending white 
Brooklynites 
with 
unkempt 

hair to romp around dangerous 
locales, searching for the likes 
of Somali warlords and black-
market kidney brokers. It’s a style 
that’s grating at best, ignorant at 
worst and, more often than not, 
does a disservice to the subject 
being covered.

But 
“Vice” 
has 
an 

outstanding host in Michael 
K. 
Williams 
(“The 
Wire”), 

whose worldview is rooted not 
in 2010s Williamsburg, but in 
1980s East Flatbush. Williams 
speaks candidly about his own 
upbringing, marked by drugs and 
violence, and about his personal 
interactions with the system. His 
nephew Dominic, who appears 
in the episode, was sentenced to 
25 years in prison as a teenager. 
It lends him an instant kind of 
credibility — rather than being 
sustained 
by 
some 
perverse 

sense of adventure, “Raised in 
the System” feels motivated by 
Williams’s 
earnest 
curiosity 

about the institutions that have 

shaped the lives of his family and 
community members.

The charm and affability that 

made him so enjoyable to watch 
as Omar Little on “The Wire” 

is on full display here. Williams 
is an exceptional interviewer 
who is able to quickly establish 
a rapport with each of his 
subjects — whether they be a 
distinguished researcher or a 
seventh grader in Newark.

The U.S. has one of the 

highest incarceration rates in 
the world, and, lately, there has 
been plenty of excellent media 
exploring the policy decisions 
that have got us to this point. 
Ava DuVernay’s (“Selma”) eye-
opening Netflix documentary 
“13th” dutifully chronicles the 

history of incarceration from 
the era of slavery to the modern 
prison-industrial 
complex. 

Journalist Nell Bernstein’s book 
“Burning Down the House” tells 
the story of the cultural and legal 
origins of juvenile justice. In the 
opening minutes of “Raised in 
the System,” we see some brief, 
damning news clips from the 
’80s and ’90s — a Newt Gingrich 
soundbite 
is 
immediately 

followed by Hillary Clinton’s 
infamous 
“superpredator” 

remarks, 
reminding 
us 
that 

there’s an equal opportunity 
blame here. But other than that, 
the documentary doesn’t spend 
too much time on history.

Instead, 
“Raised 
in 
the 

System” 
focuses 
on 
where 

we are now and how people 
and communities are fighting 
to solve this problem. The 
documentary takes us around 
the country to visit various 
mentoring 
organizations 
and 

anti-recidivism programs trying 
to 
end 
the 
school-to-prison 

pipeline. These all certainly 

make for compelling subjects, 
but “Raised in the System” 
reaches its emotional heights 
when Williams speaks with 
people who have been locked up 
since youth — the incarcerated 
people we meet all show keen 
emotional 
intelligence 
and 

genuine remorse.

“Part of me’s glad I’m locked 

up, because I got my shit together 
while doing my years,” says 
16-year-old prisoner Danielle. 
“But it don’t take 30 years for you 
to get your shit together.”

And though the episode ends 

on a somewhat hopeful note, it’s 
a decidedly bittersweet one that 
leaves us with some lingering 
questions: Why do we choose to 
criminalize adolescence? Why 
does our society withhold the 
privilege of screwing up from 
Black youth? How much potential 
have we sentenced to waste 
away behind bars? What have 
we done? The issue at hand is a 
daunting, generational problem, 
and Williams has treated it with 
needed urgency and gravity.

Wagner, Matthews weigh the NBA

It’s the age-old question The 

Clash famously put to music in 1982. 
Should I stay or should I go?

That’s the predicament in front of 

Moritz Wagner, as he mulls leaving 
Michigan and entering the NBA 
Draft for the second straight season.

As expected, though, the junior 

center was non-committal about his 
plans at the Wolverines’ end-of-year 
banquet on Wednesday.

“It’s definitely a good problem to 

have because I have great options,” 
Wagner said. “This is the second 
year in a row with no major injuries, 
where I can stand here in front of you 
and try to avoid questions about my 
future.”

Wagner tentatively entered the 

Draft a season ago, moving without 
an agent to gain feedback on his 
abilities and stock. He ultimately 
decided against it. Scouts said he 
needed to bolster his defense and 
rebounding. The NBA was simply 
“too risky.”

But the process wasn’t entirely 

futile.

“(I learned) you got to give 

yourself time,” Wagner said. “You 
gotta be selfish, listen to your own 
heart, gut, talk to your people (and) 
take the time you need. Obviously, 

there are deadlines, but at the end of 
the day, listen to yourself.”

Time is even more of the essence 

this time around, however. With a 
late ending to the Wolverines’ season 
following the run to the Final Four, 
Wagner has 10 days to decide and 
meet the league’s April 22 deadline.

“I’m old enough now to measure 

that and be confident in my ability,” 
Wagner said. “It’s more about a 
very, very special place, and that’s 
something that was very important 
to me last year that I wasn’t ready to 
(leave).”

The readiness of Wagner’s game 

is, of course, the other side of the 
equation.

Wagner indeed bettered his 

rebounding, averaging nearly three 
rebounds more than did a season 
ago. He also scored a hair below 15 
points per game and was virtually 
unstoppable down the stretch, 
leading the Wolverines to the 
National Championship Game.

Still, Michigan coach John Beilein 

— although undoubtedly considerate 
of 
his 
players’ 
professional 

aspirations — would rather prospects 
be overcooked than underdone.

“We want you to be over-ready,” 

Beilein said. “…We’re getting the 
final information from the different 
sources. Just make an educated 
decision, and don’t turn back.”

That’s also the approach Beilein 

will take in advising Charles 
Matthews — the redshirt sophomore 
guard 
who’s 
rumored 
to 
be 

pondering the NBA too.

After a sluggish start to the 

Big Ten slate, Matthews excelled 
down the stretch as he continually 
picked his spots more efficiently. 
The turnovers, and more specially 
the walks, dipped. The field-goal 
percentage 
rose. 
That’s 
why, 

suddenly, the Draft is a possibility for 
the Chicago native.

Matthews also has the option of 

simply testing NBA waters. That 
was, of course, the choice of Wagner 
in 2017. Ultimately, it’s a nuisance 
Beilein sees both sides to.

“There’s reasons both ways (to 

enter or not),” Beilein said. “People 
have seen them, people have come to 
our practices. Sometimes, the testing 
could show weaknesses they’re still 
developing on. On the other hand, 
testing could be, ‘Okay, I’m the real 
deal.’ That’s what we’re all trying to 
sort out.”

Will Matthews be one-and-done 

in a Michigan uniform? Will Wagner 
leave for good? One way or another, 
April 22 is decision day for the pair.

“We’ve got a lot of data for 

(them) to look at,” Beilein said. “And 
whatever decision (they) make, it’s 
gonna be a good one.”

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

Junior forward Moritz Wagner decided to return for his junior season, and now he weighs his future prospects again.

Michigan takes first loss in Big Ten

It’s a match she’ll surely want 

back. 

Yes, many other components 

factored 
into 
the 
Michigan 

women’s tennis team’s loss to 
Northwestern on Sunday, but 
all senior Mira Ruder-Hook will 
remember is the third set she 
couldn’t close out. 

After blanking No. 11 Illinois 

on Saturday, 4-0, the Wolverines 
entered Sunday ready to face No. 
13 Northwestern. The Fighting 
Illini and the Wildcats were the 
only two teams that were likely 
to challenge Michigan for the Big 
Ten Championship, and due to 
Northwestern’s narrow 4-3 victory, 
the title will likely belong to the 
Wildcats.

A lot of different things needed 

to occur for Ruder-Hook to find 
herself in the situation she was in. 
It started with a loss of the doubles 
point.

The Wolverines found a recipe 

for success against Illinois with 
a hot start, clinching the doubles 
point easily with a pair of 6-1 wins 
in the No. 1 and No. 2 doubles slots. 
Unfortunately for Michigan, it 
wasn’t able to do the same against 
the Wildcats.

The point came down to the 

No. 2 doubles match. After fending 
off two match points, sophomores 
Chiara Lommer and Lera Patiuk 
couldn’t prolong it any further, as 
Lommer succumbed to an ace up 
the middle, sealing the point for the 
Wildcats.

It wasn’t ideal, but nothing the 

Wolverines couldn’t manage.

Junior 
Brienne 
Minor 
was 

the first off the court in singles 
competition, and she evened the 
score with a 6-3, 7-5 win. 

The score was 1-1. 
As Northwestern’s Inci Oguy 

tried to close out the match, Patiuk 
fended her off for as long as she 
could, but ultimately fell, 6-3, 6-2. 

The score was 2-1. 
An unlikely loss from junior Kate 

Fahey at the No. 1 spot followed 
quickly after. Fahey never seemed 

to settle into the match, and her 
frustration was clear in the 6-4, 6-3 
loss.

The score was 3-1. 
If anyone else lost their match, it 

would all be over. If that added extra 
pressure, it didn’t show. Freshman 
Alyvia Jones captured a two-set 
victory easily, winning, 6-4, 6-3. 

The score was 3-2. 
With the first set under her belt, 

Lommer had a safety net. She was 
down 5-3 in the second set, but 
had no interest in going to a third. 
Winning the next four straight 
games, Lommer took the second set 
— and the match. 

The score was 3-3. 
Ruder-Hook’s teammates had 

done all they could, and then it was 
up to her. 

She fell into an early 5-1 hole, but 

proceeded to win the next six games 
to take the first set. Set point was 
met with dispute — after a long rally, 
Wildcat Alex Chatt hit the ball just 
long. Complaints came from Chatt 
and her coach, but Ruder-Hook 
was already on her way back to the 
bench to prepare for the second set. 

When she returned for the 

second set, Chatt took it easily, 6-3, 
slowing Ruder-Hook’s momentum. 

Instead of a 10-point super 

tiebreaker, Ruder-Hook and Chatt 
had the opportunity to play the 
whole third set out — and it couldn’t 
have been closer. They traded games 
back and forth until it seemed as if a 
tiebreaker was the only option. That 
is until Ruder-Hook was up 5-4 and 

the score was 40-15. 

She hit it just wide, but two 

match points remained. She tried 
to fire a shot down the line and it 
landed in the middle of the net, 
but one match point remained. She 
sailed the ball long, and the score 
was even again. 

“It’s not so much strategy, it’s 

just fighting,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein. “Trying to keep 
her calm, because really she knows 
what she has to do there. It’s just 
being there and supporting her.”

By the time the tiebreaker came 

around, it was anyone’s guess who 
would take — or even deserved — 
the match. 

But Chatt took control of the 

situation and maintained a solid 
lead until she closed it out, 7-4. 

The 
score 
was 
4-3, 
and 

Northwestern was on top. 

“You’re not changing anything, 

technique or strategy,” Bernstein 
said. “It’s just being support because 
it’s a very stressful situation for a kid. 
Everything’s on you.

“…We just told her to keep her 

head up and she gave us all she had. 
There’s still a lot to play for.”

The Wolverines are no longer 

perfect in Big Ten play and will 
most likely have to relinquish 
their reign of the Big Ten title. But 
Michigan did prove it could hang 
with the best, and if the Wolverines 
meet the Wildcats in the Big Ten 
Tournament, the team and Ruder-
Hook would want nothing more 
than to change the outcome.

Michigan infielders settling into their roles after tough start to season

When the Michigan baseball 

team took the field eight weeks 
ago in Port St. Lucie, Florida, 
for its opening day matchup 
against Army, junior shortstop 
Ako Thomas was the only 
remaining starter from the 
star-studded infield that led 
the Wolverines to an NCAA 
tournament berth a year ago.

At the time, the team and 

its coaching staff expected to 
experience growing pains. But 
the extent of those pains was 
not clear until a few weeks 
into this season, when the 
Wolverines opened their home 
season with an 8-3 loss to 
Lawrence Tech.

“We’d like to think that 

coming 
into 

this 
season 

that we’ve put 
ourselves 
into 

a 
position 
to 

reload 
and 

not 
rebuild,” 

said 
Michigan 

coach 
Erik 

Bakich after an 
earlier loss to 
Lipscomb. “But 
clearly 
we’re 

rebuilding right now. We’ll see 
how we progress from here, but 
so far this has been nothing but 
disappointment.”

Now, the Wolverines are 

riding a 15-game win streak 
into 
this 
weekend’s 
series 

against 
Maryland. 
While 

Thomas remains entrenched 
atop the lineup, the rest of the 
infield consists of players who 
were not in Ann Arbor a year 
ago.

Even 
Thomas, 
the 
unit’s 

mainstay, had to work through 
early-season 
defensive 

struggles to establish himself 
as the leader he was expected 
to be. He has just one error over 
his last 13 games, while hitting 
.310 with 12 stolen bases during 
the win streak.

To his left, freshman Jack 

Blomgren has started all but 
one game at shortstop. But the 
defensive-minded 
Blomgren 

started the season as a black 

hole in the lineup, batting just 
.154 with no extra-base hits 
in Michigan’s 4-11 start. Since 
then, he has hit .341 with four 
doubles and his first collegiate 
home run, while providing 
excellent defense.

“You just want him to be able 

to be consistent,” Bakich said 
“… He’s a consistent worker, 
he’s got a great attitude, he’s 
a tough kid. He brings all the 
intangibles to the table.”

In the corners, Bakich has 

inserted two newcomers in 
recent weeks after losing Jake 
Bivens and Drew Lugbauer to 
last year’s MLB Draft.

Despite 
a 
rocky 
start, 

freshman first baseman Jesse 
Franklin has emerged as the 
starter out of an early-season 
platoon, hitting .354 with a 

team-leading 
four home runs 
since 
winning 

the 
full-time 

starting job.

“Besides 

having 
really 
good 

upperclassmen 
role 
models, 

I 
think 
the 

biggest 
thing 

is just that all 

of the coaches really believe 
in us,” Franklin said after a 
3-for-5 
performance 
against 

Central Michigan. “Even if we 
do poorly in the field, they still 
encourage us, and I think deep 
down they really think we can 
do it. You can really see and feel 
that when you talk to them.”

Perhaps the most striking 

example of that faith has come 
across the diamond in junior 
third baseman Blake Nelson. 
The college transfer had one 
at-bat 
in 
13 
games 
before 

starting the finale at Lipscomb. 
Since then, he has started every 
game and been moved into the 
clean-up spot.

“He’s a tough gritty kid. He’s 

a (Junior College) bandit. He’s 
a high baseball IQ guy,” Bakich 
said. “I think he’s gonna be a 
great coach some day.

“He’s not your prototypical 

four-hole 
hitter, 
because 

we’re not asking him to hit 

(extra-base hits), but he moves 
runners along and gets on base 
and knocks runs in when the 
opportunity presents itself. … 
He’s a tough out, he can hit and 
run, he can bunt, he can steal, 
he can handle the bat.”

Nelson’s 
greatest 

contribution, though, has been 
completing 
the 
Wolverines’ 

infield. After seemingly playing 
a different combination every 
game early in the season, 
Bakich has run out the same 
infield in 11 of Michigan’s last 
12 games — all wins.

“Guys are starting to settle 

into their roles so that breeds 
confidence, and they can start 
to express themselves more 
freely and play more loosely,” 
Bakich said. “We were bouncing 
Ako between short and second 
and rotating third basemen, 
first basemen, second basemen. 
We had a lot of moving parts, 
and I think that (caused) the 
inconsistency.”

Junior third baseman Blake Nelson has started in every game since having just one at-bat in Michigan’s first 13 games.
“Guys are 
starting to 

settle into their 

roles.”

Michigan beats Spartans, 1-0, thanks to defense

Outstretched 
and 
tumbling, 

Thais Gonzalez dove to tap home 
just as the Michigan State catcher 
reeled in the ball and flew toward 
her in a desperate attempt to get 
her out.

By the slimmest of margins, 

Gonzalez was safe.

The No. 17 Michigan softball 

team was then tasked with 
protecting the lead in an otherwise 
offensively-lacking day. Where the 
offense failed, the defense thrived, 
as the Wolverines won, 1-0.

“We’re not swinging real well 

right now,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “I can’t tell you 
why, but yesterday, I didn’t think 
we swung well, and we didn’t 
swing well tonight. And I think we 
allowed the opposing pitcher to 
get in our heads a little bit.

“So as a coach, your job is to find 

another way to get it done, and 
that’s what we did today. And I 
knew it was going to be a defensive 
game, and I was not at all surprised 
that it was a close game and a low-

scoring game.”

The Wolverines put on a clinic 

defensively, making plays when 
they needed to be made. Junior 
catcher 
Katie 
Alexander 
and 

freshman 
left-hander 
Meghan 

Beaubien understood this and 
played their roles to perfection.

With one out and a runner 

on first in the top of the second, 
Beaubien baited the Michigan 
State batter into swinging with 
two consecutive rising fast balls, 
striking her out on a full count. 
Without a second of hesitation, 
Alexander rose after catching 
the final strike and threw a bullet 
to freshman shortstop Natalia 
Rodriguez to catch the runner 
attempting to steal second. With no 
margin for error, Rodriguez tagged 
the Spartan to end the inning.

Later, with two outs in the top of 

the sixth inning, Rodriguez threw 
a rapid, aimless ball to senior first 
baseman Tera Blanco in hopes 
of preventing a base hit. It flew 
nowhere near Blanco and looked 
due to give extra bases.

However, 
Alexander, 
in 
a 

fundamentally sound play, trailed 

the baserunner and stayed close 
to the dugout so that she would be 
ready for a play like that.

“Every single time there’s a play 

in the infield, the catchers follow,” 
Alexander said. “It’s just a routine 
play. Not all, we don’t throw the 
ball away a lot, but to be ready for 
it to actually happen, it just shows 
that we practice it, so just to be 
ready for it was cool.”

Not only did Alexander assist 

the defense with plays in the field, 
but she helped Beaubien on the 
mound as well mentally. Right 
after her extra-base-saving play, 
Alexander met with Hutchins 
and Beaubien on the mound. They 
needed to calm the freshman’s 
nerves.

“Tonight, she told me, ‘You 

were born to do this.’ ” Beaubien 
said. “And I thought that was 
really cool, because like, I’ve 
wanted to be here for so long, and 
she was just like, ‘Hey, you love 
this. You want to do this.’ And 
then you kinda remember, like, ‘Oh 
yeah, I do,’ and it kinda gets you 
back in the right mindset. So she’s 
awesome at knowing what to say at 

the right time.”

Despite 
the 
inconsistency, 

Beaubien still performed at an 
elite level, recording a shutout. Up 
until being met at the mound for a 
conference, she had only allowed 
two hits and proceeded to close out 
the game, throwing a groundout 
and a line out in the final inning 
before striking out the last batter. 
While she loaded the counts on 
more at-bats than usual, she found 
ways to strike out the batter in 
many situations — finishing the 
game with seven strikeouts.

On the offensive end, nothing 

Michigan tried was effective. 
Until it was.

After three scoreless innings 

— one of which had an error 
the Wolverines couldn’t exploit 
— Michigan found its first run 
in a hustle play by Gonzalez. 
Alexander found first on a fielder’s 
choice, and Gonzalez got the nod 
from Hutchins to do her role: 
pinch running.

When her time came, the 

sophomore 
went 
without 

hesitation. Freshman designated 
plater Lou Allan reached first, soon 
followed by a bunt by sophomore 
third baseman Madison Uden 
to advance the bases. Gonzalez 
was then pushed into the role 
of designated pinch runner for 
Allan. On a ground ball up the 
middle that resulted in a fielder’s-
choice out at first, Gonzalez kept 
running around third toward 
home. Recollecting themselves, 
the Spartans threw the ball home. 
But it was too late.

With a wrap-around touch of 

home base, Gonzalez scored the 
only run of the game.

The remaining innings turned 

into fruitless attempts to add to the 
lead, however.

Stranding six runners on base 

and recording just six hits all 
game, the Wolverines failed to find 
an offensive rhythm for a second 
game in a row.

But it didn’t matter. With a slim 

lead and an impenetrable defense, 
Michigan did what it needed, even 
if it took a low-percentage play to 
do so.

Baserunning leads to 
win for the Wolverines

Thais Gonzalez isn’t your 

stereotypical hero.

The sophomore has all of 28 

at-bats this season, just three 
of which resulted in hits. She’s 
started 10 games, has four runs 
batted in and has an on-base 
percentage of .219.

On 
Wednesday 
against 

Michigan State, Gonzalez didn’t 
have a hit. She didn’t have an 
RBI, and she didn’t get on base. 
But with her legs, she made all 
the difference for the No. 17 
Michigan softball team, scoring 
the only run of the game.

For 
both 
teams, 
offense 

was hard to come by. But the 
Wolverines demonstrated that if 
they couldn’t create separation 
on offense, they’d do it on the 
basepaths. 
And 
ultimately, 

what separated Michigan from 
the Spartans in a 1-0 win was 
its ability to make the most of 
its few opportunities.

In the bottom of the fourth, 

senior 
first 
baseman 
Tera 

Blanco sent a ground ball 
through the third baseman’s 
legs for a single. She was 
pulled 
for 
a 
pinch-runner, 

senior outfielder Nikki Wald, 
but there, things didn’t go 
according 
to 
plan. 
Instead 

of stealing second or taking 
the extra base on a hit, Wald 
was tagged out on a fielder’s 
choice off the bat of freshman 
designated player Lou Allan.

But the Wolverines got a 

second chance.

Sophomore third baseman 

Madison 
Uden 
laid 
down 

what looked like a sacrifice 
bunt, but she sped down to 
first base and beat the throw. 
Gonzalez pinch-ran for Allan, 
and suddenly it was first and 
second, 
one 
out. 
Gonzalez 

knew what she had to do.

“When she put me in at 

second, I knew she just wanted 
me to score on anything on the 
ground,” Gonzalez said. “So 
just trusting her instincts and 
finding home plate somehow.”

Junior 
catcher 
Katie 

Alexander came to the plate 
and slapped a ground ball 
hard behind second base. For 
a fleeting moment, it seemed it 
would get through for a single, 
but it was instead collected by 
the shortstop, who threw to 
first for the easy out.

Except 
Michigan 
State 

paused, and Gonzalez never 
stopped running until she had 
slid in under the tag at home. 
Michigan had its first — and 
ultimately, only — run of the 
game.

“It wasn’t much decision-

making (to send her),” said 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins. “I saw the ball going 
up the middle, and I did not see 
the kid field it. I was sending 
her — I thought the ball was 
getting through and midstream 
I realized she actually had it 
and I thought, ‘We’re gonna 
keep going,’ and we snuck it in 
on them.”

The two teams combined 

for three baserunners the rest 
of the game. Freshman left-
hander Meghan Beaubien took 
control from there, and the 
Wolverines had their victory.

That 
was 
all 
it 
took. 

Michigan hustled while the 
Spartans 
hesitated. 
And 

with their baserunning, the 
Wolverines manufactured the 
run — and the win.

“It’s 
just 
a 
matter 
of 

taking 
advantage 
of 
your 

opportunities,” 
Gonzalez 

said. “We hadn’t really gotten 
a lot of runners into scoring 
position, so … you just really 
wanted to make sure you were 
taking good jumps off the bag 
and taking advantage of every 
opportunity you got.”
