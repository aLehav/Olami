The number of reported sexual 

assault, sexual harassment, dating 
violence and stalking cases at the 
University of Michigan increased 
from 2017 to 2019, according to two 
reports released in January, one by 
the University’s Division of Public 
Safety and Security and the other 
from the Office of Institutional 
Equity. In this article, the term 
“sexual misconduct” will refer to a 
grouping of sexual assault, sexual 
harassment, stalking and dating 
violence cases, unless otherwise 
noted. 

According to the DPSS report, 

from 2017 to 2019, the number 
of reported sexual misconduct 
incidents increased from 96 to 
140. The greatest increase was in 
reports of stalking, which grew from 
24 incidents in 2017 to 50 in 2019. 
Incidents of fondling and domestic 
violence also increased between 
2017 and 2019. 

DPSS used data from OIE and 

the Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center, as well as its 
own data, to formulate the Annual 
Security and Fire Safety Report. 
This report, released in January, 
includes statistics not only on sexual 
misconduct but also other types of 

crime.

While the total number of 

sexual misconduct incidents per 
year reported to Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center 
from 2017 to 2019 stayed around the 
mid- to low-300’s, sexual harassment 
cases specifically sharply increased, 
according to the DPSS report. While 
there were 45 sexual harassment 

cases reported to SAPAC in 2017 and 
10 in 2018, this number grew to 89 in 
2019. The number of stalking cases 
reported to OIE also grew, from 40 
in 2017 and 31 in 2018 to 52 in 2019.

OIE also released its own January 

report separate from DPSS only on 
statistics of the cases reported to 
OIE, which, like the DPSS report, 
show the total number of sexual 

misconduct cases reported went up 
significantly starting in 2017 and 
has continued to rise since then. 
Starting in 2014, there were 134 OIE 
violations, which increased to 322 
in 2020. Between 2014 and 2020, 
annual OIE violations increased 
almost every year.

ADMINISTRATION

VACCINE

BECCA MAHON/Daily

All adults in Michigan will become eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine on April 5.
All Michigan adults eligible for 
COVID-19 vaccine starting April 5

All Michigan adults will be 

eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations 
beginning April 5, Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer announced Friday. 

Whitmer also announced Friday 

the opening of an eight-week mass 
vaccination site at Ford Field in 
Detroit on March 24. The mass 
vaccination site was selected by 
the Biden administration and the 
Federal Emergency Management 
Agency 
under 
the 
federal 

government’s 
vaccination 
pilot 

program. The site will have the 
capacity to administer 6,000 doses 
per day to what the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
determined to be a hard-hit and 
vulnerable population.

The announcement comes after 

Whitmer previously reported that 
all adults 50 years old and older will 
be eligible to receive the vaccine 
beginning on March 22. Under the 
new guidelines announced Friday, 
adults ages 16 to 49 with underlying 
medical conditions will now also be 
eligible for the vaccine on the same 
date.

“I want to thank President Biden 

and FEMA for the opportunity 
to build one of the nation’s first 
community 
vaccination 
sites 

to service the entire Southeast 
Michigan region,” Whitmer said 
in a press release Friday. “Over one 
million Michiganders of all races 
have already been safely vaccinated, 
and this site will help us to reach 
our goal of equitably vaccinating 70 
percent of Michiganders who are 16 
years or older more quickly.”

As of March 5, roughly 26% 

of 
University 
of 
Michigan 

students 
and 
employees 
have 

been vaccinated. As of March 

11, 
Michigan 
Medicine 
has 

delivered nearly 74,000 total first- 
and 
second-dose 
vaccinations. 

Currently, 
Michigan 
Medicine 

is in Phases 1A and 1B of vaccine 
prioritization, which include all 
Michigan Medicine employees, 
frontline and essential workers and 
adults 65 years old and older. 

During 
a 
pandemic 
that 

disproportionately affects minority 
communities — particularly Black 
communities — and individuals 
with lower social vulnerability 
indexes, the Detroit vaccination site 
aims to serve those who are most 
vulnerable to infection, Lieutenant 
Governor Garlin Gilchrist said. 
The vaccination site was chosen 
in accordance with the CDC’s 
prioritization 
recommendations 

and aims to serve all southeastern 
Michigan communities. 

“After a year of tremendous 

challenges and heartache, the new 
vaccine site at Ford Field will be a 

beacon of hope in a community that 
was hit hard by the devastating 
impacts of this deadly virus,” 
Gilchrist said in the press release. 
“When we saw this virus targeting 
Black and Brown communities, 
Michigan got to work setting up 
one of the nation’s first task forces 
to help reduce the staggering, 
disproportionate rate of COVID-19 
cases and deaths in communities of 
color.”

During its first three weeks, 

the 
site 
will 
administer 
the 

Pfizer vaccine to individuals who 
qualify according to the social 
vulnerability index, guaranteeing 
them a second dose in the fourth, 
fifth and sixth weeks of operation. 
The social vulnerability index is 
a tool developed by the CDC to 
analyze how social factors impact a 
community’s health risk. 

Detroit to open 8-week mass vaccination site with FEMA at Ford Field

U-M to have most classes
in-person, open residence

halls at nearly 80% 

capacity for fall semester 

Plan is predicated on assumption that faculty, 
staff and GSIs will be vaccinated by August

Most classes will be taught 

in-person, residence halls will be 
open at almost 80% capacity and fans 
will be allowed to attend sporting 
events in-person “as allowed by the 
public health measures” during the 
Fall 2021 semester, the University 
of Michigan announced Friday 
afternoon. 

While 
most 
small 
classes, 

seminars and discussion sections 
will be in person, most large lecture 
classes will continue to be remote, 
though the announcement said this 
could vary by school and college for 
pedagogical purposes. On-campus 
dining halls will offer in-person 
and 
carry-out 
meal 
options. 

Residence halls and living-learning 
communities will be open to 
students. Libraries, museums, study 
spaces, gyms and student support 
centers will have more in-person 
components available while still 
offering some remote options.

Additionally, campus employees 

who have been working remotely 
throughout the pandemic will 
return to campus in a phased 
manner over the summer. Some 
will continue to work remotely for 
some of the workweek. Research 
opportunities for graduate and 
undergraduate 
students 
will 

continue expanding gradually as 
well. 

The plan presumes that all faculty, 

graduate student instructors and 
staff will have access to a COVID-
19 vaccine before the fall semester 
and that a significant proportion 
of students will have also been 
vaccinated, according to University 
President Mark Schlissel. 

According to the announcement, 

“this will all be accomplished within 
the boundaries of the state and local 
public health safety measures in 
place at that time.” At a COVID-
19 
briefing 
Friday 
afternoon, 

Schlissel noted recent COVID-19 
developments such as lowering case 
numbers and improving vaccination 

rates. 

“A third highly effective and 

safe COVID-19 vaccine has been 
approved, President Biden has 
called for all adults to be eligible 
for vaccination by May 1, we’re 
seeing fewer cases on campus and 
across the nation, and forecasts for 
hospitalizations are decreasing,” 
Schlissel said. 

Furthermore, 
the 
state 
of 

Michigan 
announced 
Friday 

morning that all adults in the state 
will be eligible for a COVID-19 
vaccine starting April 5, tossing 
out the phased approach the state 
planned while vaccine supply was 
more limited.

Chief 
Health 
officer 
Preeti 

Malani 
said 
weekly 
COVID-

19 testing would continue to be 
offered throughout the summer 
and possibly the fall semesters and 
urged all U-M community members 
who are eligible to get vaccinated 
wherever possible.

“I’m very optimistic that the fall 

will look and feel more like a typical 
semester on campus,” Malani said. 
“We’ll all need to continue doing 
our part by remaining flexible and 
vigilant. I encourage everyone to 
get vaccinated against COVID-19 
whenever you become eligible.”

By the end of the summer, 

Schlissel said the vast majority of the 
U-M community will be vaccinated. 
As of March 5, The Michigan 
Daily found that 26% of the U-M 
community has been vaccinated. 
Dr. Sandro Cinti said that 22% of the 
state is fully vaccinated in Friday’s 
COVID briefing.

“We will be moving quickly to a 

safer environment,” Schlissel said.

Still, Malani said students should 

expect face coverings and social 
distance to continue to some extent 
in the fall. 

The fall semester plan is still 

flexible, so if vaccinations exceed 
expectations, in-person activities 
will expand and public health 
measures will be modified, Schlissel 
said.

Order of Angell votes to 
permanently disband

CAMPUS LIFE

Order of Angell, a controversial 

exclusive society for seniors at the 
University of Michigan, announced 
on March 12 their vote to officially 
disband in a letter signed by Order’s 
class of 2021. Order — previously 
an all-male secret society known as 
Michiguama — is often criticized 
for its elitist behavior and past 
appropriation of Native American 
culture. 

In the letter, the class said its 

decision to disband, which the 
organization says occurred on 
Feb. 22, came after months of 
discussion and reflection on the 
society’s history of harm, racism 
and elitism.

“Order of Angell was founded on 

the mission to make the Michigan 
campus a better place for students,” 
the letter reads. “We realized that 
any actions we could take would 
not be adequate in healing the 
past and improving the future of 
the organization. Ultimately, the 
historical lack of transparency 
and sufficient action prevent the 
achievement of this core mission.”

The letter said the organization’s 

class 
of 
2021 
learned 
about 

Order’s 
past 
“misappropriation 

of Indigenous cultures, exclusion 
of certain social identities, and 
perpetuation of white patriarchal 
structures of power” upon being 
initiated and looked to reform 
the society. However, the class 
of 2021 wrote they recognize 
their complacency in joining and 
continuing Order caused further 
harm.

“In the strongest terms possible, 

we condemn any attempts to keep 
the organization alive in secret, 
restart the group, or build a new 
one that seeks to erase the history 
of the Order of Angell,” the letter 
reads.

The announcement of Order’s 

vote to disband comes after the 
current 2021 class sent an email 
to the society’s alumni on Feb. 17 
asking for feedback on Order’s 
value to the University and on if 
Order should continue on campus. 
According to the email, a copy 
of which was obtained by The 
Michigan 
Daily, 
Order’s 
class 

of 2021 did not start “on a solid 
footing” due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, small class size and 
being perceived as racist, among 
other reasons.

The following article explains 

five bills that have been introduced, 
passed or signed into law by the 
Michigan state legislature or Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer from Feb. 25 to 
March 11. 

On the second and fourth 

Fridays of each month, The 
Michigan Daily will publish 
a compilation of bills being 
floated around in the Michigan 
state legislature for students 
at the University of Michigan 
to know about. This is the first 
installment in this series.

1. Michigan COVID-19 

Recovery Plan 

House Bills 4047 and 4048
Status: 
Signed 
into 
law 
by 

Whitmer with a line-item veto of 
two sections.

Whitmer signed this package 

of bills into law on March 9. 
The package allocates more 
than $2.5 billion in COVID-
19 relief and is a key part in 
Whitmer’s pandemic recovery 
plan. The legislation contains 
a $2.25 per hour wage increase 
for direct care workers through 
September, 
$223 
million 
in 

emergency rental assistance and 
roughly $665 million in funds 
for vaccine distribution, testing 
and contact tracing efforts.

Gov. Whitmer vetoed certain 

parts of the bill that aimed to 
strip the state health department 
director’s powers and limit her 
executive powers in handling 
the pandemic. As a result of 
her vetoes, close to $1 billion 
in funding will be lost from the 
bill, as Michigan Republican 
lawmakers 
tied 
limiting 

executive powers to this funding. 
This lost funding includes $100 
million for non-public schools 
and summer school programs, 
$405 
million 
in 
property 

and tax relief for businesses 
and $150 for unemployment 
insurance all being vetoed. The 
vetoes leave about $2 billion in 
federal COVID-19 relief money 
delegated to Michigan up for 
grabs. 

In 
a 
letter 
to 
Michigan 

lawmakers, Whitmer critiqued 
Republican lawmakers for trying 
to strip her of executive rights 
to handle the pandemic, saying 
it was “a reckless idea, poorly 
executed and poorly timed.”

“I note that this legislation 

leaves more than $2 billion in 
federal money unappropriated,” 
Whitmer said. “As Michigan 
goes all-out to finally beat back 
this awful pandemic and turn 
the page to recovery, we need 
every last dollar going to work 
for us before the Legislature 
takes its Spring Break.”

Daire Rendon, R-Lake City, 

said in a statement that he 
believes 
the 
legislation 
will 

have a negative impact on small 

businesses and those who are 
unemployed.

“Federal money was set aside 

to help shuttered businesses 
and devastated families through 
the worst crisis of their lives,” 
Rendon 
said. 
“Instead, 
the 

governor has chosen to play 
partisan 
politics, 
choosing 

winners 
and 
losers, 
rather 

than extending hope to all 
Michiganders. This failure is 
just the latest in her continuing 
claims that the administration 
is doing everything possible to 
save lives.”

 

2. Election Reform Package: 
Addressing Findings From 

Auditor General Report

House Bills 4127-4131
Status: Passed by MI House, 
headed to state Senate.

This election reform package 

aims to improve the absentee 
ballot process to accommodate 
the greater demand for absentee 
voting, and helps sift through 
existing Michigan voter files 
to remove people who have not 
been voting or do not have their 
birthdate on their registration. 

Before 
cancelling 
people’s 

voter registration, H.B. 4127 
requires the Secretary of State 
— currently Jocelyn Benson — to 
send voters a postcard notifying 
them a placeholder birth date 
is on their voter file and they 
have to change it to the correct 
birth date. If a postcard is not 
returned or able to be delivered 
and if the individual does not 
engage in voting-related activity 
by the second general election 
after the notice was sent, their 
voter registration is canceled.

The bill passed 61-48.
Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, 

voted nay.

H.B. 4128 would cancel a 

voter’s registration if they have 
not voted since the 2000 general 
election — which would affect 
over 300,000 Michigan voters. 
To prohibit the cancellation, 
voters would have to fill out a 
card they receive by mail and 
send it back to the election clerk’s 
office. Their voter registration 
would still be canceled if they 
do not participate in a voting-
related activity — such as casting 
a ballot or updating their voter 
registration — within the next 
two general elections. 

The bill passed 66-43.
Again, Ann Arbor’s state Rep. 

Rabhi voted nay. 

H.B. 4129 requires a list of 

the names of county and local 
clerks who are not up to date 
on their election training to be 
published on the Secretary of 
State’s website.

The bill passed 87-22.
Rabhi voted in favor. 
H.B. 4130 and H.B. 4131 

both work to ensure clerks 
consolidate 
precincts 
by 

increasing the number of voters 
assigned to one precinct and 
to keep an up-to-date list of 
absentee voters. The bills also 
require cities and townships 
with two or more precincts to 
create absentee ballot counting 
boards to process and count 
absent voter ballots.

H.B. 4130 passed 79-30 and 

H.B. 4131 passed 104-5. 

Rabhi voted in favor of both 

bills.

3. Bill Aiming to Divide High 
Schools Sports by Biological 

Sex 

Senate Bill 0218
Status: Introduced in the Senate.

Introduced 
by 
state 
Sen. 

Lana Theis, R-Brighton, and 
sponsored by 12 other GOP 
lawmakers, 
this 
bill 
was 

introduced with the intent of 
requiring high school students 
to compete on high school sports 
teams solely based on their 
biological sex. The legislation 
defines biological sex as ‘the 
physical 
condition 
of 
being 

male of female’ as said on the 
individual’s birth certificate.

Theis said in a statement 

that she thinks the bill is a 
way to uphold the legacy of 
Title IX, a federal law that 
protects students from gender 
discrimination in educational 
programs.

“Something must be done to 

preserve the legacy of Title IX 
— a staple of American society,” 
Theis said. “So, very simply, my 
bill will ensure that, in school 
sports in Michigan, student 
athletes will compete against 
one another according to their 
biological sex — females against 
females, 
and 
males 
against 

males.”

The 
bill 
also 
comes 
as 

Republicans across the country 

set out to prevent transgender 
women 
from 
competing 
on 

female sports teams. Democrats 
have strongly opposed such 
legislation on the basis that it is 
a strong attack on transgender 
students and transgender rights. 

4. Drunken Driving 

Expungement for First-time 

Offenders 

House Bills 4219-4220
Status: Passed by the House.

Sponsored 
by 
state 
Reps. 

Tenisha 
Yancey, 
D-Harper 

Woods, 
and 
Joe 
Bellino, 

R-Monroe, 
these 
two 
bills 

would 
expunge 
first-time 

drunk driving offenses from 
individual’s records.

H.B. 4219 allows drivers who 

were convicted of driving while 
intoxicated 
to 
remove 
their 

first offense from their record, 
granted the offense did not 
cause death or serious injury to 
another individual. The erasure 
of offenses applies to violations 
of local, state and federal laws, as 
well as violations that occurred 
on Native American territory.

H.B. 4220 gives first-time 

offenders the opportunity to 
apply for expungement from a 
judge.

The MI House passed the 

piece of legislation 93-17. 

Rabhi voted in favor of both 

bills. 

5. A Resolution to Keep 

Daylight Saving Time All Year
Senate Bill 231
Status: Introduced.

This bill, introduced by state 

Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann Arbor, 
aims to keep Michigan on the 
same time system all year round, 
eliminating 
daylight 
savings 

time. The bill does not specify if 
Michigan would be on daylight 
saving time or standard time. 
This coming weekend, Michigan 
will “spring forward” and lose 
an hour of the day starting 2 a.m. 
Sunday, March 14. Clocks will 
revert back an hour on Sunday, 
Nov. 7 at 2 a.m.

Irwin said he has been a long-

time supporter of the removal 
of daylight saving time and 
released a statement saying 
daylight saving time causes 
heart 
attacks, 
strokes 
and 

general crankiness. 

“Twice a year, we volunteer 

Michiganians 
for 
more 
car 

accidents and injuries at work,” 
Irwin said. “We see lower 
productivity and an increased 
number of heart attacks and 
strokes, as well as a noticeable 
uptick in general crankiness. 
The twice a year time change 
has no benefits for our state, 
and we should stop doing it 
immediately.”

The bill was introduced on 

March 11.

City Council discusses uses for marijuana excise tax

CITY

Councilmembers commit to investing in community services, officially recognize Transgendender Day of Visibility

The Ann Arbor City Council 

met virtually Monday evening 
to 
discuss 
a 
resolution 
to 

acknowledge Ann Arbor resident 
Daniel 
Bicknell’s 
longstanding 

career in public service, the 
allocation of excise tax revenue 
from 
recreational 
marijuana 

and the implementation of a 
Transgender Day of Visibility.

The meeting began with a 

discussion of a resolution to 
commend Bicknell, the president 
of Global Environment Alliance 
LLC, for his acts of public service. 
Bicknell is credited for discovering 
the 1,4-dioxane pollution in the 
Third Sister Lake as a researcher at 
the University of Michigan in 1984. 
The pollution, which started from 
the company Gelman Sciences, 
eventually spread to a large plume 
in the underground water system 
in Ann Arbor. 

Councilmember Jeff Hayner, 

D-Ward 1, spoke in favor of the 
resolution, saying the recognition 
was well-deserved. He added 
that Ann Arbor resident Roger 
Rail should also be recognized for 
working alongside Bicknell.

“I think it’s great that the 

environmental commission has 
brought this forward to recognize 
Bicknell and the work he’s done 
over the years, decades really, 
on 
the 
Gelman 
plume 
issue 

specifically,” Hayner said. “He’s 
freely shared his knowledge and 
experience with us over the years 
about this issue, and I think that’s 
terrific.” 

The 
resolution 
passed 

unanimously. 

In October 2019, City Council 

debated 
whether 
or 
not 
to 

legalize the sale of recreational 
marijuana, which was passed 9-2 
at that meeting. When City Council 
passed 
this 
ordinance, 
there 

were no plans made for the excise 
taxes that would be collected, 
Councilmember 
Ali 
Ramlawi, 

D-Ward 5, said. 

Councilmembers debated item 

DC-3 on the agenda, which aims 
to use revenue from the excise tax 
placed on recreational marijuana 
“in a way that intentionally 
reinvests 
in 
our 
community, 

acknowledges the past harm of 
criminalization, 
and 
supports 

populations 
disproportionately 

and negatively impacted by the 
‘War on Drugs.’” 

Ann Arbor received 1% of the 

state’s revenue from the tax, 
totaling about $476,000 for Ann 
Arbor. 

Councilmembers are currently 

trying to figure out how exactly 
the revenue should be used in the 
community. 

In the original discussions in 

October 
2019, 
councilmembers 

discussed how these excise taxes 
could be used for social justice, 
mental 
health 
and 
substance 

abuse issues, Ramlawi said. More 
specifically, Ramlawi suggested 
putting the money toward unarmed 
crisis response teams that could 
serve as an alternative to police in 
mental health crises. These teams 
gained 
increasing 
mainstream 

traction after a summer of protests 
for racial justice and against police 
brutality.

“It is my intent and my wishes 

to see this money go to programs 
that currently don’t exist and 
that this can be used in ways that 
are innovative and responsive 
to the issues we hear from our 
community based on the need for 
unarmed 
emergency 
response 

(teams),” Ramlawi said.

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Aria 

Schugat called into the meeting 
in support for DC-3 but expressed 
concern about the vagueness of 
where the money from the excise 
taxes will go. Schugat proposed 
that the excise taxes go towards 
supporting the housing association 
of Washtenaw County and the 
Delonis Center. 

“I believe that if we help our 

most vulnerable members and help 
lift them up, we can lift everyone 
else up with them,” Schugat said. 

Hayner said he spoke with 

members of the community and 
people in the cannabis industry to 
discuss how the money from the 

excise taxes should be used.

“Overwhelmingly to the last 

person, the comment was it 
must have a community use and 
do public good in areas that are 
underfunded and have great need 
in our community,” Hayner said. 

DC-3 was sponsored by over 

half of the members on the council. 
Councilmembers 
intend 
to 

incorporate this resolution into the 
2022 budget, but have yet to decide 
exactly where the money will be 
allocated to. 

“Essentially what we’re asking 

this body to do is to agree in 
principle that this goes towards 
community uses and public good,” 
Hayner said.

The 
resolution 
passed 

unanimously.

The council also discussed 

a 
resolution 
to 
officially 

recognize a Transgender Day 
of 
Visibility. 
Councilmember 

Travis 
Radina, 
D-Ward 
3, 

said there is a need for more 
education and awareness around 
the topic of transgender rights, 
especially 
since 
transgender 

people 
face 
higher 
rates 
of 

discrimination. 

Councilmember 
Elizabeth 

Nelson, D-Ward 4, voiced her 
support for the resolution and 
discussed 
the 
generational 

differences 
in 
understanding 

issues 
of 
transgender 
rights. 

Nelson said this resolution is 
important for her son’s generation 
and 
future 
generations, 
who 

will 
grow 
up 
understanding 

systemic discrimination against 
transgender people.

“This is really an opportunity 

for those of us who are old enough 
to remember the terrible way 
things used to be to make a real 
effort to move forward,” Nelson 
said. “And I’d like to say I’m really 
optimistic about the future based 
on the conversations I have with 
my own children.”

The resolution was approved 

unanimously.

Thursday, 
March 
11 
marks 

one year since the University of 
Michigan suspended all in-person 
classes in response to the COVID-
19 pandemic and transitioned the 
majority of academic activities to an 
online format. The same day, Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer announced all 
Michigan high schools would be 
required to go online as well. 

A year later, another class of high 

school seniors is struggling to sift 
through hours of virtual resources 
and campus tours to choose if, 
and where, they want to pursue 
postsecondary education. Yet a 
handful of high school students are 
getting a taste of the University’s 
undergraduate experience in a 
unique way — by participating in the 
“dual enrollment” program, which 
allows students to earn college 
credit if they have “exhausted” the 
courses offered at their high school 
in a particular subject area and have 
demonstrated high performance on 
standardized tests and AP exams. 

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald told The Daily there has 
been a “modest increase” in the 
number of high school students 
who elected to dual enroll at the 
University this academic year. 
For the fall 2020 and winter 2021 
semesters, 30 and 23 high school 
students dual enrolled in various 
University 
classes, 
respectively, 

compared to 18 and 17 students 
in the fall 2019 and winter 2020 
semesters.

Once a student’s dual enrollment 

application is accepted, they can 
register for the classes they selected 
on the application during the first 
day of the term, provided there are 

still open seats available. 

The cost of tuition for these 

students depends on the number of 
credit hours requested. Fitzgerald 
said for a four-credit course, tuition 
totals $2,843, which does not 
include additional costs associated 
with books or other class-specific 
materials. Though each high school 
covers a specific amount of this 
cost, determined by the Michigan 
Department 
of 
Education, 

the students are expected to 
individually pay for the remainder 
of their tuition and fees.

The 
Community 
Resource 

Program, however, allows high 
schoolers enrolled in Ann Arbor 
Public Schools with at least a 3.5 
grade point average to receive 
high school credit for auditing a 
University class — without paying 
tuition — so long as the individual 
professor grants permission.

Students who choose to engage 

in University coursework through 
the program are still expected 
to attend lectures, participate in 
any associated discussions or lab 
components and complete any 
assignments and exams to receive 
high school credit.

When 
discussing 
the 
67% 

increase 
in 
University 
dual 

enrollment from the fall 2019 to 
the fall 2020 semester, Christopher 
Kasper, a counselor at Pioneer 
High School in Ann Arbor, said 
he thinks the online environment 
might be more attractive to high 
school students with tight academic 
schedules, fewer transportation 
options or various extracurricular 
activities. 

“It’s been nice this year in the 

sense that if a student did want to 
dual enroll, they could technically 
be a little bit more flexible with 
the 
timeframe,” 
Kasper 
said. 

“Usually there are some logistical 
parameters that are in effect where 
most of our students can’t take a … 
college class during the school day 
and they have to look to the late 
afternoon or the evening.”

On the other hand, Kasper said 

some students might be deterred 
from paying for virtual dual 
enrollment courses due to Zoom 
fatigue from their high school 
classes and the lack of on-campus 
experiences.

Kimberly You, a sophomore 

at Pioneer High School, is dual 
enrolled in MATH 285 and 217. 
You said with the virtual format, 
she has enjoyed continuing her 
mathematical education beyond 
what the high school curriculum 
traditionally offers without having 
to sacrifice any high school classes 
she wanted to take.

“It was easier to adjust my 

schedule since I can still take 
seven classes,” You said. “If I was 
still at Pioneer in-person, I could 
only take six classes because of the 
commute.”

Haakam Aujla, a senior at 

Bloomfield Hills High School, said 
though the University was his first 
choice for dual enrollment this year, 
he would likely not have been able 
to consider it as an option if classes 
were in-person because of the 
45-minute commute.

Having 
previously 
taken 

other dual enrollment courses at 
local colleges, Aujla said his dual 
enrollment in the University for 
MATH 465 and 425 this year gives 
him an idea of what his freshman 
year might be like if he decides to 
accept his offer of admission to the 
University.

OIE violations increased almost 
every year. 

Unlike the DPSS report, the OIE 

report does not include information 
on sexual harassment. Because 
sexual 
harassment 
specifically 

is not a crime that is mandatory 
to report for data collection 
under the Clery Act, a consumer 
protection law that aims to provide 
transparency 
around 
campus 

crime statistics and policy, student-
reported 
sexual 
harrassment 

cases do not get directed to OIE 
by whomever the students reports 
it to.

OIE and DPSS are the two 

organizations at the University 
that oversee sexual misconduct 
reports and investigations. When a 
student reports sexual misconduct 
to a responsible employee, that 
employee is mandated in their 
employment contract to report 
the case to either OIE or DPSS, 
depending on the employee’s role. 

SAPAC is an additional resource 

that 
helps 
student 
survivors 

by 
offering 
peer-led 
support 

groups and directing them to 
further 
assistance 
through 

referrals. SAPAC is confidential, 
meaning they “will not share any 
information with anyone” unless 
there is a potential for harm to the 
student or others. Though SAPAC 
does not oversee reports and 
investigations, they do collect data 
to use in reports by the other two 
organizations due to the Clery Act.

SAPAC 
Director 
Kaaren 

Williamsen said SAPAC internally 
tracks the identities of students 
who report but does not include 
that information when giving it to 
DPSS to be included in their annual 
report, as specified by the Clery 
Act. OIE is also required to report 
sexual misconduct statistics to 
DPSS because of the Clery Act. 

University community 

discusses results of the reports

Elizabeth Seney, the OIE Title 

IX coordinator, discussed the 
increased cases in the two reports. 
Seney, who is in charge of deciding 
whether 
OIE 
will 
investigate 

sexual misconduct cases, collects 
data of these cases and looks at 
trends in internal aggregate data 
documents. 

Seney said the increase in 

reported cases does not necessarily 
mean there are more instances 
of sexual misconduct on campus, 
but instead that more people are 
reporting.

“In general, it is never the case 

where we can look at the numbers 
and the trends and pinpoint exactly 
what is going on,” Seney said. 
“But generally speaking, I don’t 
necessarily interpret an increase, 
or … decrease to mean that there is 
more or less of a particular type of 
conduct happening. I tend to first 
think about reasons why people 
might be reporting more or less.”

OIE does not require people to 

include their identities in reporting, 
but Seney said students who report 
as identifying as LGBTQ+ tend to 
have a higher risk of facing sexual 
misconduct. 

SAPAC has noticed a significant 

increase in the number of graduate 
students coming to the center 
as compared to undergraduate 

students in the past year, according 
to SAPAC Associate Director Anne 
Huhman. She said this increase 
may be a result of increased 
community outreach within the 
graduate student community in 
recent years. 

“The first thing that came to 

my mind in terms of a clear trend 
is actually more around undergrad 
versus 
grad,” 
Huhman 
said. 

“We’ve definitely seen a trend of 
more graduate students coming 
forward. We’ve possibly seen a 
connection 
between 
increased 

community outreach, education, 
and training efforts with the grad 
student population.” 

According 
to 
Seney, 
it 
is 

impossible to say what caused 
the number of sexual misconduct 
reports to go up, but she said there 
are several possible explanations 
for the data trend.

“Some of the factors that tend to 

influence (the number of reports), 
which I think align pretty well 
with those years (2017-2019), is an 
increase in the training that we 
do about reporting,” Seney said. 
“When there are policy changes, 
and … a refresh of training on 
reporting and required reporting, 
(the number of reports increases).”

A change in the definition 

of sexual misconduct in U-M 
policy documents may also have 
contributed to the increase. In 
2016, the definition of stalking 
was revised to be more specific 
and included it as a formal form of 
sexual misconduct. As a result, she 
said, there was an increase in the 
number of stalking cases that were 
reported starting in 2017.

Seney 
also 
said 
social 

movements 
and 
increased 

exposure of sexual misconduct 
in the media have a large impact 
on people’s perception of these 
offenses, which might influence 
survivors to come forward.

“The other thing is when 

there’s issues in the news, both 
nationally and at the University, 
(reports increase),” Seney said. 
“Every year, starting around the 
beginning and the height of the 
#MeToo movement in late 2017, 
we have seen more news coverage 
about particular cases, and about 
how universities … and other 
educational institutions handle 
these things. I think sometimes 
that can bring reports to the 
forefront because it’s on people’s 
mind.”

Huhman 
echoed 
Seney’s 

statement and said the increase 
in exposure of sexual misconduct 
cases could potentially influence 
people’s decision to come forward.

“We do know what some of the 

common complex barriers are 
for survivors to come forward,” 
Huhman said. “I do think if there’s 
heightened visibility around it, 
sometimes 
people 
see 
others 

having the courage to come 
forward, and that can always be a 
powerful influence.” 

There has been a number of 

high-profile sexual misconduct 
cases at the University in recent 
years, particularly among faculty 
and staff. In 2018, The Daily 
conducted an investigation that 
uncovered over 40 years of sexual 
misconduct from former Music, 
Theatre & Dance professor Stephen 
Shipps. 
David 
Daniels,another 

former Music, Theatre & Dance 
professor,was fired in March 2020 
over sexual assault allegations 

that occured during and before his 
tenure at the University. Former 
U-M Provost Martin Philbert 
was removed from his position in 
March 2020, leading to a report 
from WilmerHale finding over 20 
years of sexual misconduct during 
his time at the University. 

Robert E. Anderson, deceased 

former 
University 
athletics 

physician and University Health 
Services director, currently has 
over 
100 
sexual 
misconduct 

allegations being litigated going 
back 50 years in his time at the 
University. Engineering professor 
Jason Mars was accused of sexual 
misconduct in Feb. 2020, and 
Engineering professor Peter Chen 
is currently on administrative 
leave following criminal sexual 
misconduct charges. 

Tamiko 
Strickman, 
the 

University’s 
OIE 
director, 
is 

facing 
two 
lawsuits 
claiming 

she mishandled sexual assault 
and racial discrimination cases 
while working at the University 
of Nebraska-Lincoln. Strickman 
worked as an investigator, deputy 
Title IX coordinator, Title IX 
coordinator and OIE director at 
UNL from 2015 to 2019. 

LSA senior Samantha Schubert, 

co-president of University Students 
Against Rape and Take Back the 
Night Ann Arbor, wrote in an email 
to The Michigan Daily that the rise 
of the #MeToo movement and 
increased support for those who 
have been assaulted have helped 
survivors to come forward. 

However, Schubert added the 

general consensus on campus 
has “become less trusting of the 
University’s ability to handle these 
cases,” particularly when the 
University was required to amend 
its sexual assault guidelines in 
2019 after the Doe v. Baum ruling 
in 2018. The amended University 
policy required mandatory live 
cross-examination, during which 
the person who alleges assault 
is questioned by their alleged 
assaulter, which drew criticism 
from the University community. 
Policy from former President 
Donald Trump’s administration 
mandated 
these 
cross-

examinations for all universities 
but by a third-party such as a 
lawyer, which some on campus saw 
as a small win within what they 
believed to be still-problematic 
cross-examinations.

“The general sense in the 

community 
was 
that 
it 
was 

detrimental to survivors, who 
were already under a lot of 
pressure when going through the 
University’s reporting system,” 
Schubert wrote. “U-M student 
orgs advocating for survivors were 
especially appalled. I know that 
there was a huge amount of anger 
amongst the members of my own 
org.”

Students have also taken “matters 

into their own hands,” Schubert 
wrote, pointing to the Assaulters 
at Umich Twitter account that 
was created in June 2020 and shut 
down in November 2020. This 
account posted pictures and names 
of people who were accused of 
sexual assault by direct messages 
from anonymous students. None of 
the allegations on the account have 
been verified by The Daily or any 
other news organization.

Isaiah 
Mayweather, 
who 

is 
incarcerated 
at 
Macomb 

Correctional Facility, returned to his 
normal cell Jan. 27 after serving 18 
days in a mandatory quarantine as 
a result of coming into close contact 
with someone who contracted 
COVID-19. However, Mayweather, 
after being tested three times, never 
once tested positive for the virus 
that has infected more than 25,000 
prisoners in Michigan alone.

Mayweather wrote in an email 

to The Michigan Daily about his 
experience being isolated for 18 days 
and never contracting the virus. 

According to Centers for Disease 

Control and Prevention guidelines, 
quarantining for 10 days without 
symptoms, or quarantining for seven 
days and receiving a negative test 
on or after day five are sufficient 
precautionary measures to take 
following a COVID-19 exposure. The 
Michigan Department of Health and 
Human Services says if individuals 
show no symptoms for 10 days 
following a COVID-19 exposure, 
they can discontinue quarantine.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer received 

criticism from activists and families 
of incarcerated individuals late last 
year for her criminal justice policy 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
While she signed an executive order 
in August 2020 to improve testing 
and transfer protocols in prisons, 
some said these actions did not 
adequately protect prisoners from 
infection.

Mayweather 
emphasized 
the 

strain that his prolonged quarantine 
took on not only his own well-being 
but on his relationship with his 
family, whom he was not able to talk 
to the entire time he was placed into 
quarantine. In-person visitations 
have been discontinued completely 
for over a year. 

“My children couldn’t imagine 

what it would be like not hearing 
from me in nearly a month’s time,” 
Mayweather wrote. “After the long 
break we were forced to take from 
each other, my relationship with 
them hasn’t been the same since. A 
lot had changed in nearly a month’s 
time.”

Based on Michigan Department 

of Corrections policy, prisoners 
should still be able to have daily 
access 
to 
phones, 
showers, 

microwaves, showers and the J-pay 
emailing 
system. 
Mayweather, 

however, said this was not the 
reality. According to Mayweather, 
an inmate who has had close contact 
with a COVID-19 positive individual 
often has less access to facilities than 
someone who tests positive. 

“On paper it looks nice and civil,” 

Mayweather wrote. “But in reality, 
we are rarely, if ever afforded these 
luxuries. If (you’re) in close-contact 
with a Covid person, it’s possible 
you can be held longer than a person 
who’s actually in violation of a rule. 
So mentally, this is draining.”

Mayweather wrote he is not the 

only prisoner who has experienced 
a long wait time in close-contact 
quarantine, claiming some prisoners 
experienced up to 30 days in close-
contact quarantine. 

MDOC 
spokesperson 
Chris 

Gautz told The Daily prisoners 
should still have access to normal 
facilities, such as regular showers 
and the use of phone and email 
services, while in quarantine. He 
did not confirm whether close-
contact quarantine could last up to 
30 days.

Gautz also said the restriction 

in programs, classes and outdoor 
activities is important in reducing 
the spread of COVID-19, what 
MDOC sees as an unfortunate but 
necessary measure. 

“We just have to remind them 

that this isn’t punitive,” Gautz said. 
“Although it may feel like it is (when 

they are) stuck in their cell for 
longer than they’d like, it’s for their 
safety.” 

Incarcerated individuals are also 

experiencing issues with testing. In 
accordance with the Department 
of Health and Human Services, 
prisoners are now being tested 
daily. As soon as the department 
found the COVID-19 B.1.1.7 variant, 
they issued an emergency public 
health order to increase testing in 
prisons. 

On Jan. 23, Steven Schutt, 

who is incarcerated at Macomb 
Correctional Facility and deals 
with severe asthma, was told he 
tested positive for COVID-19 and 
was sentenced to a mandatory 
quarantine — yet Schutt, who never 
showed a single symptom, was 
convinced it was a false positive. 
According to Schutt, his family’s 
request for him to be re-tested was 
denied. 

“We were never swabbed the 

entire time I was (in quarantine),” 
Schutt said in a written message to 
The Daily. “The only thing they did 
was check our vitals and more (or) 
less wait and pray (I didn’t) get sick 
from (my roommate) or the other 
guys that were already there. I 
worried every day … I (cried) on the 
phone to my family and we couldn’t 
do anything about it.” 

According to Schutt, an antibody 

test later revealed that Schutt did 
not have any COVID-19 antibodies. 

Gautz said he knows nothing of 

the alleged false positive test and 
that all testing is conducted through 
private labs due to the large capacity 
of tests being ordered.

“I don’t know of many doctors 

who would falsify a record just so 
their hospital could make more 
money,” Gautz said. “So I’m not 
really sure where that (accusation) 
would come from.”

CRIME

Community reacts to legal challenge 

to U-M campus firearm ban

Michigan Attorney General 

Dana Nessel filed an amicus 
brief on March 1 against Joshua 
Wade, an Ann Arbor resident 
who challenged the University of 
Michigan’s on-campus firearm 
ban. According to the amicus 
brief, it is within the University’s 
constitutional rights to enact a 
firearm ban on campus, though 
the case remains held in the 
Michigan Supreme Court. 

Amicus briefs are filed by 

parties not directly involved in 
a lawsuit to support one side of 
a case. 

Nessel’s 
brief 
backs 
the 

University and argues court 
precedent 
supports 
their 

firearms 
ban, 
noting 
that 

restrictions on firearm carry 
exist in other sensitive places 
like churches and primary and 
secondary schools.

“When it declared the rough 

contours of the amendment, the 
Court was careful to single out 
core areas in which governments 
may 
regulate 
firearms 
— 

including 
longstanding 

prohibitions on guns at school,” 
the brief reads. “From the first 
colleges on American soil to the 
present day, states and colleges 
have exercised their authority 
to regulate firearms in myriad 
ways, from outright bans to 
clear permission to carry. The 
University’s 
prohibition 
fits 

within this range of permissible 
options.”

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald 
agreed, 
writing 

in an email to The Daily that 
the University is well within 
its 
constitutional 
rights 
in 

prohibiting weapons on campus, 
citing the 2008 Supreme Court 
case District of Columbia v. 
Heller. 
This 
landmark 
case 

recognized the right of public 
entities to regulate handguns in 
schools and public buildings. 

“Guns 
have 
been 
banned 

for decades and courts have 
upheld the University’s right to 
prohibit weapons from campus,” 

Fitzgerald wrote. “The safety 
of the University community is 
one of our highest priorities as 
a University. Allowing weapons 
on campus undermines those 
efforts.”

Psychology 
professor 
L. 

Rowell Huesmann, who studies 
aggressive behavior and media 
violence, said Wade is unlikely 
to win his case due to the 
precedent set by D.C. v. Heller. 
He added that the University 
and 
surrounding 
community 

is better off with the standing 
firearms ban. 

“Numerous 
studies 
show 

that not only when people 
have 
firearms 
is 
there 
a 

greater likelihood of people 
being 
seriously 
hurt 
during 

disagreements and arguments, 
but just the sight or knowledge 
of firearms being around is what 
we psychologists call a ‘prime’ to 
behaving more aggressive and 
violent,” Huesmann said. “So 
there’s a lot of studies that show 
that just the sight of a firearm 
makes people more likely to 
think more aggressively and 
violently than they otherwise 
would.” 

Huesmann said the argument 

that guns make people safer 
isn’t backed by data. Instead, he 
said, the presence of firearms 
increases the likelihood of gun 
violence.

“Studies also show that the 

concept of providing protection 
is 
very 
misplaced 
— 
that 

firearms don’t provide personal 
protection in the way that people 
think,” Huesmann said. “In 
fact, they are likely to lead to 
accidental shootings and killings 
of people. The idea that they 
provide significant protection 
against nefarious people is just 
not borne out by the data.” 

LSA freshman Macy Hannan 

said she doesn’t see a difference 
between the University and 
other 
places 
like 
churches 

and primary and secondary 
schools that are able to regulate 
firearms. 

“From my understanding, my 

high school was able to (ban 
firearms), churches are able to 

(ban firearms), I don’t get why 
this is any different of a situation 
and I think it’s something that 
should be done,” Hannan said.

Hannan said she would feel 

less safe walking around campus 
if the courts were to strike down 
the firearms ban.

“I think it is the University’s 

responsibility to help keep me 
safe, and they should be able 
to keep me safe so then I don’t 
need to,” Hannan said. “I would 
definitely 
feel 
more 
scared 

walking around campus if (the 
ban is repealed).” 

LSA 
junior 
Ryan 
Fisher, 

president of the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans, 
said court precedent gives the 
University the right to regulate 
firearms on campus. But Fisher 
added that he believes allowing 
concealed carry of firearms on 
campus would make students 
safer. 

“College campuses especially 

are a sensitive location, and I do 
think it could be alarming openly 
carrying 
firearms, 
especially 

given some recent history with 
school shootings,” Fisher said. 
“Concealed carry, on the other 
hand, averts the possibility that 
someone could be upset with 
the fact that you are carrying 
a firearm while nevertheless 
giving people the opportunity 
to 
defend 
themselves, 
and 

even defend others in times of 
danger.” 

LSA 
freshman 
Barry 

Dechtman disagreed and said he 
doesn’t see a need for students to 
carry guns on campus and has 
faith in the University’s ability 
to protect its students. 

“There’s 
no 
real 
need 

to have guns on a college 
campus,” Dechtman said. “I 
think protection is a big thing, 
but I think there are many 
alternatives and a lot of other 
measures the University can take 
to keep students safe (instead 
of allowing guns on campus). 
Without guns, I feel a lot safer.”

Survivors Speak protests for 
transparency, accountability

Marching through the streets 

of downtown Ann Arbor, dozens 
of protesters gathered with signs 
demanding racial justice and 
equality 
Saturday 
afternoon. 

Chants calling for racial justice, 
police 
accountability 
and 

governmental 
transparency 

were punctuated by drum beats 
as 
onlookers 
watched 
from 

sidewalks.

Saturday’s 
protest, 
hosted 

by non-profit advocacy group 
Survivors Speak, marked exactly 
a year after the police killing of 
Breonna Taylor, a 26-year old 
woman from Louisville, Ky. who 
was killed in her apartment when 
officers wrongfully broke into her 
home and fired 32 rounds after 
Taylor’s boyfriend fired one. No 
officers involved in the shooting 
currently face criminal charges. 

According to the organizers, 

Survivors Speak is dedicated 
to 
amplifying 
the 
voices 
of 

victims of any form of injustice, 
and 
Saturday’s 
protest 
was 

centered around the theme of 
accountability. 
On 
the 
steps 

of Hatcher Graduate Library, 
speakers took to the microphone 
to emphasize the necessity of 
fighting for accountability within 
public institutions and called for 
transparency on issues unique to 
Ann Arbor.

Trische’ Duckworth, executive 

director and founder of Survivors 
Speak, told The Michigan Daily 
before the protest that she began 
the organization in 2018 as a 
way to support those fighting for 
widespread 
transparency 
and 

justice.

“Normally 
survivors 
are 

recognized 
as 
rape 
victims, 

molestation, domestic violence,” 
Duckworth said. “But we took it 
a step further in saying, really, 
all of us are surviving something, 
right? Like some kind of pain, 
some kind of trauma. And so we 
wanted to honor all survivors and 
to help people free themselves in 
the midst of what they’re going 
through.”

Duckworth 
also 
said 
she 

believes unity is essential when 
it comes to holding officials 
accountable. 
People 
have 
a 

responsibility, Duckworth said, to 
ensure that local officials follow 
through on promises they made 
when they ran for office.

“We have to hold ourselves 

accountable so that we can 

continue to stay the course and 
pay attention to what’s going 
on around us, pay attention to 
what’s going on in legislation,” 
Duckworth said. “But then we 
have the job to hold our legislators 
accountable to ensure that they 
hold true to the agenda items that 
we have approved for them when 
we elect them.”

Jazmyn 
Bradford, 
School 

of Social Work student and 
intern 
for 
Survivors 
Speak, 

told The Daily that the purpose 
of Saturday’s protest was to 
encourage community members 
to advocate for justice in their 
local 
governments. 
Many 

speakers emphasized that Ann 
Arbor is no exception to police 
violence against Black and Brown 
people. Many also discussed their 
experiences with systemic racism 
within Ann Arbor Public Schools. 

“We want community members 

to understand that we have 
the power to put people in the 
positions that they’re in. … We 
want social justice,” Bradford said. 
“We want policies that are actually 
going to make change happen.”

Law School student Solomon 

Furious 
Worlds, 
who 
also 

attended the rally, is representing 
Makayla Kelsey, Ann Arbor Public 
School student, and her mother 
Charmelle Kelsey in a case against 
instances of racial discrimination 
in Pioneer High School. The 
Kelseys originally submitted a 
complaint with the Michigan 
Department 
of 
Civil 
Rights 

in August 2020 alleging that 
AAPS created a racially hostile 
environment. 

The Civil Rights Litigation 

Initiative, a clinic at the University 
of Michigan Law School, also sent 
a letter to AAPS administrators 
on behalf of the Kelseys in August 
2020. According to the letter, 
Kelsey 
allegedly 
faced 
racial 

discrimination 
from 
current 

Pioneer math teacher Michele 
Macke.

Worlds said he attended the 

rally both to show solidarity with 
the demands — like accountability 
and transparency by Ann Arbor 
police and elected officials — 
mentioned by other speakers and 
spread awareness about others’ 
experiences of racism within 
AAPS. 

Worlds 
also 
called 
for 

protestors to sign a petition 
calling for AAPS to publicize 
the results of the investigation 
into the alleged discriminatory 
incidents. According to Worlds, 
AAPS has not followed through on 
demands to implement a system 

where 
students 
could 
report 

instances of racial bias and civil 
rights organizations could provide 
transparent 
investigations. 
As 

of Sunday evening, the petition 
has garnered more than 1,200 
signatures. 

In an October 2020 statement 

in response to CRLI’s letter, AAPS 
Superintendent 
Jeanice 
Swift 

emphasized the school district’s 
commitment to investigating the 
incidents of racial discrimination.

“In the AAPS, we take this 

situation and the matters outlined 
in that letter very seriously,” 
Swift wrote. “All of us are deeply 
disturbed by the content of the 
allegations. We are committed to 
a full and thorough investigation 
of those matters as we understand 
the important value each child 
brings and are deeply committed 
to equity and opportunity for each 
and every student we serve.”

Saturday’s 
protest, 
Worlds 

said, was meant to call for racial 
justice both at the community and 
national levels. 

“Today, there’s mourning and 

remembrance, with regards to the 
killing of Breonna Taylor, but not 
just for Breonna but also for Tony 
McDade, Michael Brown, Laquan 
McDonald and for so many people 
whose names we don’t remember,” 
Worlds said. “The injustice started 
in 1619, and it continues today. It 
didn’t end with slavery, it didn’t 
end with Jim Crow. It continues 
today.”

Ezra 
Peiter, 
a 
14-year-old 

student from Chelsea, Mich., 
attended the protest and said he 
joined the movement to combat 
racism within Michigan police 
departments. He spoke to the 
audience about how the Chelsea 
Police 
Department 
failed 
to 

protect 16-year old protester Mya 
King when she was assaulted by 
an older woman while peacefully 
protesting 
at 
a 
Black 
Lives 

Matter protest this past summer. 
The woman was charged with 
misdemeanor assault. 

Last month, Drop the Charges, 

a 
community-led 
movement 

to drop charges from peaceful 
protests, began petitioning to 
withdraw charges against those 
who received tickets for impeding 
traffic during Black Lives Matter 
protests. King received a citation 
for attending the July 31 protest 
and the charges against her were 
eventually dropped on Feb. 15 
after numerous attempts by the 
CRLI to have them rescinded. 

Demonstration marks one year since police killed Breonna Taylor

Support student journalism: The Daily 
joins ‘College Media Madness’ fundraiser 

From March 15 to April 5, more 

than 20 college newspapers across 
the nation, including The Michigan 
Daily, will participate in the College 
Media Madness competition to 
earn the most money for their 
newsroom. The competition is 
organized by Syracuse University’s 
independent news organization, 
The Daily Orange.

Tara Moore, The Daily’s business 

manager, said the idea is to mimic the 
March Madness hype while raising 
money for student journalism. 

“We’re seeing all these different 

university 
basketball 
programs 

come together — so we figured it’d 
be a lot of fun to have the same kind 
of rivalry,” Moore said. “There are a 
bunch of different schools that have 
all come together to fundraise and 
have some friendly competition.” 

The 
Michigan 
Daily 
will 

be 
accepting 
donations 
via 

collegemediamadness.com, 
and 

contest 
coordinators 
will 
be 

updating the rankings frequently. 

“In many communities, these 

outlets are the primary source of 
news,” a statement on the CMM 
website reads. “College journalism 
fills a void left by the closure of 
newsrooms across the country, one 
that has rapidly accelerated amid 
the COVID-19 pandemic. But these 
organizations need your help. By 
donating to a student newsroom, 
you’re 
supporting 
the 
next 

generation of journalists.” 

Moore 
said 
the 
COVID-19 

pandemic has made the past year 
financially difficult for the Ann 
Arbor community. As a result, The 
Daily has lost significant funding 
from local advertising. 

“It is no secret print journalism 

and student journalism as a whole 
is struggling and going through 
a tough time right now,” Moore 
said. “And the pandemic is no help 
to that, and so we want to get any 
and all support that we can from 
different donors.” 

Claire Hao, The Daily’s editor-

in-chief, said this money will 
be critical to helping The Daily 
support its journalists so they can 
provide important and up-to-date 
coverage for the local and University 
communities.

“The Michigan Daily is a free 

service,” Hao said. “… But none of 
that work is cost-free, even though 
we provide it for free.” 

All funds raised will go directly 

into The Michigan Daily Program 
Fund to support essentials like 
travel 
to 
cover 
away 
games 

and news events, printing and 
distribution, updating equipment 
and software as well as conference 
and competition fees.

Currently, The Daily’s Sports 

section is hard at work capturing 
Michigan men’s basketball in March 
Madness action. Managing Sports 
Editor Lane Kizziah said The Daily’s 
Sports section is unique in its ability 
to cover so many different revenue 
and non-revenue sports. 

“We are one of the few outlets 

that has the quantity of people on 

our staff to be able to cover things 
like that,” Kizziah said. “I think it’s 
because we get people so excited 
about covering things and writing 
stories, and we just have such a great 
community in the section which 
really helps us work.” 

Managing Sports Editor Kent 

Schwartz said fundraising events 
like 
College 
Media 
Madness 

are critical to helping build that 
community. 

“(Sports 
Writers) 
get 
these 

experiences and they get these 
opportunities that these fundraisers 
offer,” Schwartz said. “(These funds 
allow them)... to be able to go on 
these road trips and to make lifelong 
friends.” 

Hao said The Daily has seen an 

explosion in the number of staff 
members joining, with about 100 
new staffers over the past two 
semesters. Hao said she thinks 
people are looking to get more 
involved on campus and stay 
informed during a virtual semester. 
However, she said increased staff 
size has stretched The Daily’s budget 
and made it all the more difficult 
to pay staffers adequately, limiting 
equitable access to the newsroom

“We’re asking for anyone who’s 

ever enjoyed or gotten some useful 
information out of our work to 
consider supporting it — supporting 
the student journalists that are 
learning so much from doing it,” 
Hao said.

Prisoners face lengthy quarantines, 
possible false positive test results

Incarcerated individual says ‘This facility then and now is still an issue’

ASHNA MEHRA &
JULIA FORREST
Daily Staff Reporters


When I sat down with Moon Choe, 

owner and operator of Moon Cafe, a Korean 
restaurant and frozen yogurt shop on State 
Street, for a 40-minute interview, I’ll admit 
I expected something of a sob story: a few 
cliché sentiments about being down on his 
luck and needing students to stop by so he 
can pay the bills. What I got instead was a 
chance to gain new insights on laissez-faire 
parenting, the subtle racism that is a hallmark 
of the immigrant experience and the private 
joys he is able to embrace from the COVID-19 
pandemic, among other topics of discussion. 
Choe is full of surprising wisdom, which he 
dishes out freely, sans condescension. 

As soon as you walk in, Moon Cafe 

comforts you. The walls are painted yellow 
and purple, clashing with the black-and-white 
checkerboard floor. Large-framed, abstract 
art prints hang on the walls, and the entire 
stretch of a mantel piece is lined with small 
figurines. The eclectic interior reminds me 
of the yummy hole-in-the-wall eateries my 
friends and I frequented during our high 
school years back at home and immediately 
assuages those requisite nerves I feel as a 
newcomer to the journalism scene.

Choe is in his early 60s and, despite his 

gray hair, looks much younger than his years. 
On the afternoon that I walk into his shop, 
he wears wire glasses, a yellow University 
of Michigan hoodie (like the true Michigan 
dad he is) with a few sauce stains, comfy 
sweatpants and padded slides with Puma 
socks. He’s dressed, in other words, for a long 
shift at the restaurant. Choe is thoughtful and 
very eloquent. Though he gestures for me to 
take a seat at the booth in front of him, he never 
quite settles into the bench facing me. Instead, 
he hovers by it, always ready to take a call or 
hand a customer their order.

I’m caught off guard when Choe begins 

the interview by throwing me the first 
question: he wants to know what my 
position at The Michigan Daily is. I tell him 
I’m a Senior MiC Editor, and he nods and 

replies that his daughter, Gina, also used to 
hold a Senior Editor position at The Daily 
during her undergraduate years. In our brief 
conversation, he mentions his children’s 
academic achievements several times. I 
can tell by the way he casually namedrops 
“neuroscience at Princeton” that he speaks of 
his son and daughter fondly and often. 

Much of Choe’s identity is, in many ways, 

tied to his role as a father and husband. 
Shortly into our conversation, Choe takes 
a phone order and calls out to the kitchen: 
“Yeobo? Spicy pork!” (Yeobo is a pet name, 
roughly translated from Korean to “darling” 
or “honey.”) Later, she calls him dangshin — 
another sweet term of endearment — when 
they’re working in the kitchen together. While 
trying to put into words what it’s like to work 
with his wife, he chuckles and says, “I cannot 
think of any bad things. Just wake up early 
in the morning, eat together — we always 
eat together … there’s no special meaning, 
we’re just married … and then we spend time 
together. That’s it.” The restaurant is a two-
person operation. Last year, they employed a 
couple U-M students part-time, but now, since 
business is slower than usual, it’s just Choe and 
his wife, Yoon, running the cafe.

Choe and Yoon, along with their son and 

daughter, immigrated to America from South 
Korea nearly 15 years ago and eventually 
settled in Ann Arbor, Mich. During his career, 
Choe worked in the automotive industry for 
32 years. (His engineering background shows 
in the way he tends to speak in exact figures, 
precise times and percentages.) When he 
retired a couple years back, he decided he 
wanted to take on “fresh and new” work. “My 
(children) grew up here in Ann Arbor … so it 
is our town,” he tells me. He decided to open a 
frozen yogurt shop to meet new students, and 
he calls this new job a different type of “good 
stress.”

In addition to frozen yogurt, Moon Cafe 

serves Korean food, which according to Choe, 
is simply “healthy food… It’s homemade, like 
Mom’s cooking.” There are, however, many 
other Korean restaurants in Ann Arbor. When 
I ask Choe what makes his restaurant different 
from the others, I expect him to tell me that he 

has some special recipe passed down from his 
ancestors or even that he also serves frozen 
yogurt — which is so delicious that it’s a valid 
point, in my opinion. But instead, he refuses 
to justify my question with an answer, out 
of solidarity with the other Korean spots on 
campus. “Korean food is Korean food. I respect 
the restaurants… we work all together,” he says. 

***
During the second quarter of 2020, America 

recorded a 9.1% quarterly drop in economic 
output, the steepest ever on record. Michigan’s 
economy may not recover until 2023, and the 
restaurant industry has suffered considerable 
losses. Moon Cafe is no exception. Business 
this year, according to Choe, has depleted to 
about 40% to 50% of its revenue from last year. 
With an awkward laugh, he says, “In a regular 
season, we think about the profit. But after 
COVID-19, the profit… there (is) no meaning, 
no more. Just we survive, how to survive.” 
Choe’s goal is to pay his bills, but profit is “over-
demanding (in his) current situation.” 

Even in the face of this financial difficulty, 

Choe has dignity. “It’s not only us. All peoples, 
the same thing… Not only this restaurant, but 

also all industries, the same thing,” he says. 

His daughter, Gina, believes that U-M 

students and the people of Ann Arbor truly 
care about their broader community, and their 
restaurant is no exception — she tells me she 
is awed by their eagerness to help in any way 
they can. 

“It makes me proud to be a U of M (alumnus) 

and to call Ann Arbor my home,” Gina says. 
“Despite the tragedies of the pandemic, it 
brought local communities together in a way 
like never before, and as a small business, we 
feel inspired by that.” 

Choe tells me he hopes that students will be 

smart and healthy during the pandemic, and 
empathize with one another. “Every student 
must… think (of) other person first. Not ‘me,’” 
he says. 

*** 
When Choe describes his love of 

connecting with the students who eat at his 
restaurant, the skeptic in me thinks he might 
be trying to score some good press for my 
story. But the student testimonies I’ve heard 
are enough to quell any suspicions I may have 
had. Engineering sophomore Webber Qu 

says, “Korean cuisine has always been one of 
my favorites so Moon Cafe (doesn’t) offer just 
my favorite dishes, but also (provides) a sense 
of comfort in a new environment.” And in a 
GoFundMe for the restaurant, the responses 
are overwhelmingly positive. Kate Cao writes, 
“Moon is the best! I want to be able to come 
back and laugh at Moon’s dad jokes,” and 
Louis asserts, “Moon is the nicest, sweetest 
restaurant owner in AA,” while Leanna says, 
“thank u for always making me feel at home :).”

Choe and his wife have a genuine love 

for Ann Arbor, which, in their eyes, is “well-
mixed,” meaning that people of all different 
races — he rattles off a few rough percentage 
estimates of ethnic demographics off the top 
of his head — co-exist in this city and treat 
each other with respect. In his eyes, growing 
up with people of other races and cultures 
is good education for children, including his 
own, because it expands their horizons and 
teaches them empathy. “Our neighborhood 
(is) very kind,” he tells me. “That’s Ann Arbor.” 

“She instilled in me the value of education 

and what it means to be a hard worker. Most 
importantly, she taught me how to love others. I 
wouldn’t be who I am if it weren’t for my mom, 
and that’s why she’s my personal Michigan hero.”

When I was in the eighth grade, I was required 

to write an essay on the subject “my personal 
Michigan hero” for an “America & Me” essay 
contest. I had mulled over the essay for so long 
that the words above became immortalized in 
my memory. I was determined to win, believing 
my mom’s story was a winner.

In the essay, I droned on about her 

accomplishments and early life. She didn’t have 
much growing up, but her parents, she told me, 
had stressed the importance of a good education, 
and she and her siblings earned merit scholarships 
that helped pay for tuition at private schools. She 
carried a thirst for knowledge into her young 
adulthood, obtaining her bachelor’s degree at 
the University of San Carlos in Cebu City before 
beginning her graduate studies at Ateneo de 
Manila University, a top-rated university in the 
Philippines. She continued her graduate studies 
in the U.S., where she met my father and earned 
her doctorate at Michigan State University. 

It wasn’t until I was much older — long 

after I had written the essay — that I learned 
about the more complex parts of her life, like 
her employment as a language instructor for 
U.S. Peace Corps volunteers assigned to the 
Philippines, her experience working as an English 
instructor in refugee camps or her time protesting 
the military dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos 
while working and going to graduate school at 
the Ateneo de Manila University. She was active 
in the protest movement known as the People’s 
Power Movement, a series of events triggered 
by the assassination of a popular political rival, 
Benigno Simeon “Ninoy” Aquino Jr., in 1983 that 
culminated in the departure of Marcos in 1986. 
My mother started protesting around the time 
Aquino was assassinated, one event in Marcos’ 
repressive, violent and corrupt regime. Part of 
her involvement with the movement included 

advocating and conducting workshops on the 
protection of ballots for the 1986 presidential 
election between Marcos and Corazon Aquino, 
the wife of Ninoy Aquino, a risky endeavor given 
the rampant cheating, militarization and political 
intimidation occurring at the time.

I didn’t win the essay contest. Looking 

back, there was no way that I could capture the 
complexity of my mother’s life within two pages, 
much of which I still had to learn about. I was, 
however, grateful to reflect on what little I knew 
of my mother’s life, and over time I would acquire 
an appreciation of the decisions she made leading 
up to having me. Learning about her experiences 
made me understand what made her who she is 
and thus, the formation of ideals that impacted 
who I am. It also made me realize the sacrifices 
she made for the life I have now, which included 
leaving her family and everything she knew in 
the Philippines. When I was in the second grade, 
she even gave up her visa and Filipino citizenship 
to become a U.S. citizen. Why? So she could vote, 
something personal that carried a significance 
I didn’t understand until I learned about my 
mother’s past endeavors.

To this day, I continue to learn new things 

about my mother that generate feelings of 
admiration and gratitude. I have never known 
someone who is as compassionate, hard-working 
and selfless as my mother. She is thoughtful, 
intelligent and relentless. She brought me into 
this world and took on many roles as I grew up, 
from educator to breadwinner to confidant. 
I would not be who I am today without her 
limitless patience, guidance and support. She’s 
raised me to be capable and independent, but at 
the same time, she is always there when I need 
her. I feel confident knowing that in an ever-
changing world, her love is constant.

This year, for Women’s History Month, may we 

commemorate the achievements that women have 
made over the course of American history. But I 
will also celebrate the women in my own life. My 
sister, aunts, grandmothers and yes, my mother. 
After all, I wouldn’t be writing for Michigan in 
Color if it weren’t for my mom. Who am I kidding? 
I wouldn’t be here without my mom.

Mahal kita, Mom. 
Translation: I love you, Mom.

Under the Clinton Administration, the 

enactment of immigration laws in 1996 led 
to bulk deportations of Arabs and Muslims. 
The Bush Administration signed the 
Patriot Act, enabling heavy surveillance 
of Arab and Muslim populations in 
America. The Obama administration 
aided in the Yemen Civil War, which is 
now “the largest humanitarian crisis in 
the world,” according to Human Rights 
Watch, (and in 2016, the administration 
dropped 26,000 bombs in the Middle 
East). The Trump administration led a 
drone strike that killed Iran’s general, 
Qassem Soleimani. And the United States 
has been a longstanding supporter of 
Israel throughout the ongoing conflict in 
Israel-Palestine, just recently opposing the 
International Criminal Court’s decision 
to open a war crimes investigation in 
Palestinian territories. Both Republicans 
and Democrats pass and enforce domestic 
and foreign policy that threaten the well-
being of Arab and Muslims communities 
both in America and the Middle East.

On Thursday, Feb. 25 the Biden 

administration ordered a military air-
strike on Syria in retaliation for a recent 
attack on American personnel in Iraq. The 
attack garnered criticism from top officials 
in Congress, with several senators claiming 
it was not constitutional. As well, some of 
the general public expressed frustration 
regarding the prioritization of a foreign 
missile strike before passing a COVID-19 
relief bill. The greatest wrongdoing was 
the attack of an already grief-stricken Syria 
for an event that took place in Iraq. 

The Biden administration’s military 

attack makes him the fifth consecutive 
president to order strikes in the Middle 
East and demonstrates the United 
States’ relentless and bipartisan militant 
involvement. Before a new COVID-19 
relief bill was passed, before student loan 
forgiveness was issued, before minimum 
wage legislation, the United States made 
an attack in the Middle East. Instead 
of prioritizing legislation to aid people 
struggling in America, the administration 
chose to inflict suffering upon Syria’s 
already vulnerable people, highlighting 
a pattern of disdain for human life — 
specifically Arab lives. This unwavering 
U.S. interference in Middle Eastern politics 
ultimately inspires an internal struggle for 
Arab and Muslim Americans concerning 
American 
elections. 
Arab-American 

voters are constantly asked to vote for 
politicians that will ultimately disappoint 
them when handling both domestic and 
foreign policies affecting their community. 

During the 2016 election cycle, Trump 

was extremely outspoken in his disdain for 

Muslim and Arab people, stating in 2015 
that the United States needs a “total and 
complete shutdown of Muslims entering 
the United States.” Simultaneously, his 
opponent Hilary Clinton had an ongoing 
history of support for the expansionist 
policies into Middle East conflicts and 
the war in Iraq. Both of these opponents’ 
platforms put Arab Americans in a hostile 
situation, asking them to choose between 
two candidates who both stood to cause 
them harm. 

Ultimately, 
under 
the 
Trump 

Administration, anti-Muslim and anti-
Arab rehotric came to the front of the 
threshold in 2017 when Trump signed an 
executive order enforcing the “Muslim 
ban” –– an act that placed restrictions on 
travel to the U.S. from majority Muslim 
countries in the Middle East. 

Though the Trump administration 

brought much of their anti-Muslim and 
Arab rhetoric to the forefront of their 
campaign, United States politicians and 
policy have had negative impacts on Arab 
and Muslim American communities long 
before Trump’s opinions gained traction. 

The continued negligence of Arab and 

Muslim people is further demonstrated 
through 
the 
way 
politicians 
take 

advantage of community organizers. 
In the documentary “Holding Fire,” 
Somia Elrowmeim, a Yemeni-Muslim 
immigrant living in a Republican district 
in South Brooklyn, N.Y., worked to 
mobilize Arab voters in her community. It 
was grassroots organizing by individuals, 
such as Elrowmeim, that enabled 
Democratic candidate Max Rose’s victory 
by a slim margin. Despite the support 
from the Arab and Muslim community in 
his district, Rose was an early and public 
critic of U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., 
for a speech she gave at the Council of 
American and Islamic Relations gala 
regarding 9/11’s impact on Muslim civil 
liberties. Elrowmeim in the documentary 
discussed how she was deeply pained and 
felt betrayed by Rose’s acts, as she, along 

with the Arab and Muslim community, 
worked hard to vote and campaign for 
him. 

Arab and Muslim American voters 

are discredited and disrespected in their 
activism, then asked to make sacrifices 
come election time. Regardless of political 
identity, families in the Middle East will 
be affected, surveillance on Muslims 
and Arabs will continue and Western 
intervention will prevent peace in the 
region. 

When 
Biden 
announced 
in 
his 

presidential campaign that Kamala Harris 
would be on the ticket as his vice president, 
I cried twice. The first cry was for the first 
Black, Indian and woman Vice President 
of the United States. The second cry was 
because I was voting for Biden and Harris, 
aware of their long-standing imperialist 
and violent history with the Middle East. 

As a “hyphenated” American, I am 

made up of both my American identity 
and the identity of my place of origin –– 
the culmination of my ancestors. I listen 
to stories from grandparents recounting 
their childhood in the homes they were 
born in. I spend summers with cousins 
running on those same streets or dinners 
eating meals with the spices and aromas 
of my heritage. Belonging is never a 
singular place. As an Arab and Muslim 
American voting, I am asked to pick one 
place to which I belong, to let go of a part 
of my home –– I cast a vote, knowing a 
piece of me will be hurt and scarred –– 
while still hoping for something better to 
come. 

I know I vote in hopes for access to 

health care, prison reform, women’s 
bodily autonomy and equality. I know 
I vote in hopes that one day, candidates 
and politicians will implore America to 
have honest conversations regarding the 
abhorrent impacts of United States foreign 
affairs –– for the hope that the interest of 
humanity will be held above the interest of 
oil — and for a better future for both of my 
homes. The places to which I belong.

Our next well-being day better not be 

disguised by the administration in the form 
of a break and exposed for what it actually is: a 
poor attempt by the University of Michigan to 
supposedly address the mental health needs of 
students and failing, miserably. 

Students 
receive 
email 
after 
email 

from University President Mark Schlissel, 
professors and Graduate Student Instructors, 
acknowledging that students are facing a 
stressful time. Each message sounds nearly 
verbatim to, “This has been a challenging time 
for everyone in our community. We’ve been 
affected personally — and tragically — by the 
spread of the virus. We’ve been asked to think 
and work differently, under considerable 

time pressures and growing stress.” But the 
current leniency –– or rather, lack thereof 
–– given by professors does not reflect this 
attitude of empathy at all; simply giving 
students two “well-being breaks” is not the 
appropriate answer. While President Schlissel 
acknowledges the breaks will not solve all of 
our problems, and that they are supposed to be 
“just a day to give time,” the break has not even 
been able to do that: my personal experience 
aside, observing other students around me has 
been the perfect testament to how the break has 
failed in accomplishing what it was set out to do.

On our first well-being day, I was sitting 

at Sweetwaters in the Michigan Union 
at 8 a.m. — the rest of the seating options 
became full in the next half-hour. If that isn’t 
a testament to how “relaxed” students were 
during the first “break,” then what is? I had 
homework specifically assigned on the day 

before the break that was due the day after. 
The only way I could have possibly enjoyed 
my day off was if I had pulled an all-nighter 
on Tuesday and woke up early on Thursday 
to finish my assignments. The sheer quantity 
of unnecessary homework that classes have 
been assigning gives the impression that 
the University is ignorant of the fact that 
the pandemic continues to impact students’ 
mental health and personal lives.

If we remove all personal experiences and 

tragedies related to COVID-19 and solely 
consider what classes are like via Zoom, that 
should be enough reason to prove just how 
frustrated students are. I have back-to-back 
classes from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Thursdays. 
That’s six hours of me rooted to the same spot, 
staring at my computer screen and skipping 
lunch only to make sure I don’t fall behind. 
On Thursdays and Fridays, I have calculus 

from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., giving me less than one 
day to address my webwork and prepwork 
assignments and textbook problems, not to 
mention having to rewatch the same lecture 
at least twice to grasp all the material. All this 
just to make sure I don’t fall behind — which 
excludes the time I need to put into studying 
for exams, team homework projects and 
quizzes. And this is one class. 

Unfortunately, I am not alone in having 

to drudge through such a monotonous, 
overwhelming schedule. I cannot even imagine 
how many other students are swamped with 
an endless to-do list, only to be rewarded with 
two days of no class — and already one of them 
being a complete failure. Yes, winter break 
was longer than it was in previous years, and 
yes, eliminating spring break altogether is 
an attempt to mitigate the spread of COVID-
19 around campus. But instead of giving a 

ridiculously long winter break, why weren’t 
we given five individual days, one every other 
week, of no class and no extra assignments, 
spaced out appropriately through the semester? 
Students are expected to maintain themselves 
physically, mentally and academically while 
being overworked to the point of exhaustion. 
And all this is enforced without considering the 
personal tragedies related to COVID-19. 

Instructors are at fault here too and need 

to give students the appropriate workload 
so that on a well-being break, students can 
actually relax and not have a tremendous list 
brimming with assignments. It should be 
obvious enough to realize that group projects 
should be completely eliminated unless there 
is no possible alternative.

WHISPER

Our next well-being break better be a break

“When I think of home, I think of a place 

where there’s love overflowing.” 

Around this time last year, I had the 

great fortune of taking part in MUSKET’s 
“The Wiz,” before the production was 
canceled due to COVID-19. As a member 
of the ensemble, I got to work with an 
amazing group of insanely talented artists, 
performing alongside an all-Black cast in 
a show that celebrates African-American 
culture in all its glory. And while the 
experience was cut short, I have long 
since remembered the sense of belonging, 
communion 
and 
intimacy 
fostered 

during the rehearsal process, all of which 
was epitomized in the finale, Dorothy’s 
final number (sung by the phenomenal 
University of Michigan alum Lauryn 
Hobbs) “Home.” 

Famously performed by Stephanie Mills 

on Broadway and by Diana Ross in the film 
adaptation, this R&B soul ballad, in all its 
lyrical genius, is a powerful expression of 
the all-encompassing love that being home 
engenders. 

As I traveled back home to Kalamazoo, 

Mich. this weekend to visit family and 
friends and to celebrate my upcoming 20th 
birthday, I reflected on this sentiment in 
the best way I knew how: driving.

In the midst of running errands, finishing 

tasks and visiting friends, I ended up driving 
in my hometown for a short but considerable 
part of my visit. And while I drove past the 
places and spaces that I had literally known 
all my life, I thought about how many 
times I had traversed these same roads in 
Kalamazoo –– day after day, week after 
week, month after month, year after year.

I thought about the hundreds of early 

morning commutes to school — talk radio 
radiating to where I was sitting in the 
backseat of my dad’s car on the way to 
elementary school, headphones hampering 
the loud chatter of the school bus on the 
way to middle school, car speakers spewing 
my favorite musical theatre songs on the 
aux of my 2006 Toyota Scion on the way to 
high school. 

I thought about the many, many miles 

made on my way to club meetings and 
class trips, football games and food runs, 
soccer practices and Sunday school lessons, 
hair appointments and hook-ups, musical 
rehearsals and movie outings.

I thought about the times I traveled 

down the freeway to friends who would be 

strangers further along the road, to sites I 
swear I’ll never see again and to scenes I 
still seek to see once more. 

I thought about the summer sunsets 

at the land preserve, the autumn outings 
to the Art Hop, the winter rides watching 
holiday lights and the spring sprints down 
the infinite fields. 

I thought about the good times — the 

windows rolled down and the sun soaked 
up. The small talk on the long rides.

I thought about the bad times — the 

breakdowns in the backseat and the tears 
wiped in front of the wheel. 

I thought about the persisting poverty, 

the rampant racism and the continued class 
divides. The streets that make the headlines 
and the lines of homeless encampments 
along the streets. 

I thought about the revolutionary 

resilience of those resisting tyranny in my 
community, the divine camaraderie of those 
combatting capitalism in its late stages and 
the liberating love keeping Kalamazoo 
afloat. I thought about how so much around 
me had changed, yet how so much has 
stayed the same. How much I’ve changed 
and how much I’ve stayed the same.

I thought a lot about how having lived 

so long in one town has yielded within 
me a cacophony of contradictions and an 
assortment of antithetical attitudes.

But most of all, while driving in my 

hometown, I thought about how after 
years and years of yearning for something 
more, vowing to venture out into the 
great unknown, how grateful I am to not 
only be able to call this place home, but to 
have a home, and for it to serve as a real 
life reminder of the miles and miles of 
memories I’ve made throughout my time 
on this Earth. 

Because just like Dorothy’s final line in 

the finale goes, “I’ve learned that we must 
look inside our hearts to find a world so full 
of love like yours, like mine, like home.”

Driving in my hometown

The Southern states froze over, and to no 

one’s surprise, their state governments have 
only made the situation significantly worse. 
They have been hit with one of America’s 
worst weaponized duos –– climate change 
and environmental racism.

During a time of great panic and 

uncertainty, when the changing climate 
created an uncharacteristic winter storm in 
Texas, the Texas state government decided to 
abandon their Black and Latinx working class 
communities. The power went out for over 
4 million Texans during the storm. Power 
companies were worried about not being 
able to support their consumers’ drastically 
increasing demand for heat and gas sources, 
so in order to meet demand, utility companies 
orchestrated controlled power outages in 
order to prevent long-term damage to the 
natural gas industry and power grids. Families 
were already struggling financially with the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and were now missing 
paychecks because the snow and ice left them 
trapped in their homes. This added cost while 
sitting in houses with no utilities was brutal 
for those already struggling to make ends 
meet. Many people did not survive through 
the power outages, lack of clean water and cold 
temperatures of this unprecedented event.

Those who lived in rural areas which lack 

hospitals, commercial businesses, commercial 
living complexes and other facilities essential 
to the Texas economy had a higher likelihood 

of being impacted by the man-made problems 
exacerbated by the storm, including the 
rise in gas prices and the controlled power 
outages. Black and Latinx communities 
who greatly inhabit these areas suffered the 
worst consequences, affirming the inherent 
correlation between climate change and 
systemic racism. These communities suffered 
through this climate and government-fueled 
disaster, while still living through the raging 
COVID-19 pandemic that is harshly impacting 
them. The government has shown that when 
worse comes to worse, they are willing to 
sacrifice Black and Latinx communities in 
order to protect an oppressive and racist 
capitalist order.

Though this storm took place in the middle 

of February, lots of people are still lacking 
access to safe water in Texas, as are some 
communities in Mississippi. Even though 
these states initially experienced a climate 
disaster, it is the government’s abandonment 
of its marginalized populations that allowed 
the storm to become so deadly. Instead 
of providing these communities with the 
adequate resources and solutions to cope 
with and manage the conditions in question, 
politicians left their constituents to fend for 
themselves. This is environmental racism, and 
it is nothing new to America. 

Over 15 years before this year’s winter 

storm, the South experienced a humanitarian 
crisis, Hurricane Katrina. In 2005, this 
hurricane 
devastated 
states 
including 

Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi. The 
deadly storm destroyed businesses, houses 
and lives throughout these states. It had an 

especially negative impact on New Orleans, 
La. –– a majority Black city. Though this was a 
natural disaster, the insurmountable damage 
was caused by the federal government 
neglecting to prepare prior to the disaster 
and in the hurricane’s aftermath, abandoning 
these communities after the storm. While 
former President George W. Bush took his 
time relaxing on his vacation, the American 
people were drowning in the 
damage of this vicious storm. 

The poor construction 

of levees that protect the 
land in New Orleans 
from 
hurricanes 

dramatized 
the 
damage 

of 
Hurricane 

Katrina. Had the 
government 
taken 

the time to implement 
protective 
measures 

and provide resources, 
like more funding and better 
quality levee construction, the 
city would have been better prepared. Tens 
of thousands of people had to permanently 
leave their Louisiana residences because of the 
damage done to their homes and businesses. 
Louisiana received large surges of aid when 
Katrina first hit, but it wasn’t enough. Despite 
the fact that the community is still suffering 
over 15 years later, conversation regarding the 
storm has greatly diminished. 

Similar to New Orleans, Puerto Rico went 

through significant trauma and destruction 
with Hurricane Maria in 2017. But when 

comparing the amount of aid that went 
to Puerto Rico with other hurricanes like 
Irma and Harvey that destroyed rich white 
continental cities, Puerto Rico received a 
lot less aid, despite having the most amount 
of destruction. New Orleans and Puerto 
Rico, still living with the damage from their 
hurricanes so many years later, while rich 
white communities are able to thrive because 

of the government’s swift aid 

after the storms, emphasizes 

America’s 
persistent 

problem of environmental 

racism.

Almost seven years 

ago, 
Flint’s 
water 

supply was found to 
be contaminated with 
lead 
and 
bacteria. 

This 
was 
another 

case of environmental 
racism in which the 

Michigan 
government 

cut down on water costs by 

changing Flint’s water supply. It’s 

notable that the government chose Flint 

for this abhorrent decision –– Flint has the 
second-largest population of Black Americans 
in Michigan. As of 2019, its population was 
54.1% Black, and 38.8% of its citizens were 
considered under the poverty line. The new 
water system was filled with bacteria and 
lead that caused many diseases, deaths and 
developmental issues in Flint residents.

When the country originally learned about 

this problem, almost a year after Flint’s water 
was first contaminated, pledges of monetary 

donations and safe water flooded into the 
city. National news channels would report all 
the latest updates, and there was persistence 
in informing the country on what was 
happening in this city. People wanted answers 
and wanted to help as much as possible, 
but as soon as the news stopped deeming 
the situation as newsworthy, conversations 
around the country stopped. Years later, Flint 
is still struggling to get clean water. A 13-year-
old Flint resident, Mari Copeny, has been 
instrumental in keeping the conversation 
going around the country since she was 8 years 
old. Government officials responsible for this 
crime are now being charged and some pipes 
have started to be replaced. But as a whole, 
national concern has lessened tremendously 
despite the persisting urgency of this problem. 
Poisoned water is still a reality for this city. 

Texas was fortunate to receive donations 

and aid from non-profit organizations in 
order to help out some of its communities who 
are struggling right now. This philanthropy 
is a testament to humanity and is effective, 
but the remedy marginalized communities 
really need is environmental justice. This 
situation is a repeated humanitarian crisis 
that will only start to heal once honest 
accountability is pursued, rather than false 
perceptions of accountability that only serve 
as a publicity stunt to distract from cries for 
help. The problems in Mississippi and Texas 
are recent, but I’m worried about what will 
happen once these events aren’t breaking 
news. Will people start to forget about 
Texas, like they have Flint, Mississippi and 
New Orleans?

Lifetime’s “Dance Moms” has long come 

to define itself as one of the most esoteric, 
passionate and wild-child offspring of 
American reality television. The show features 
the unhinged and intrinsically convoluted 
kingdom that dance teacher Abby Lee Miller 
built at her Pittsburgh dance studio. Producers 
painted Abby Lee as a maverick of the East 
Coast dance scene and ultimately a brash, 
unfiltered, iron-fisted ruler with no grace 
or tact for anything other than a weekend 
competition win and bedazzled, color-
coordinated jewelry. Abby Lee’s teaching 
style could often be likened to a hardened, 
Machiavellian-esque approach, in which her 
clear favorites — those she believed had the 
greatest potential for economic and cultural 
yield for her empire — were handpicked to 
be stars amongst the rest of her students. 
Abby Lee’s manufactured and painstakingly 
curated child prodigies were handed the most 
vulnerable and beautiful routines, budding 
music careers, one-on-one coaching and the 
coveted Abby Lee-branded and approved 
dance team jacket. 

Abby Lee Miller is a delightful enigma in 

her own right, and she built one of the most 
recognizable institutions in dance from the 
ground up, further cementing herself as a 
highly-seasoned veteran of the craft. During 
the show’s filming, Abby Lee was fond of 
declaring that her students should save their 
tears for the pillowcase, dangling solos as 
the ultimate bargaining chip and using a 
pyramid of the cast members’ headshots as a 
weekly ranking system of their performance. 
And viewers soon learned that the key to 
success at the Abby Lee Dance Company 
was to keep your head down, point your toes 
just right and keep your mother from ever 
contradicting Abby Lee’s administrative 

decisions. Abby Lee was also managing 
tangled legal troubles after she pled guilty in 
2016 to federal charges of bankruptcy fraud 
and received a one-year prison sentence 
along with a hefty fine. In April 2018, shortly 
after her release from prison, Abby Lee was 
diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma, and she 
temporarily lost her ability to walk after a 
long ordeal with cancer treatment and spinal 
surgery. And now the last and most recent 
season of “Dance Moms,” outfitted with a 
new cast of moms, climatically yields a more 
self-aware Abby Lee Miller.

Adhering to its namesake, the stars and 

catalyzers of “Dance Moms” were the moms 
themselves. Often at odds with Abby Lee 
over solos and duets, costume assignments 
and Abby Lee’s spontaneous hiatuses from 
work or ordeals of favoritism, moms and 
daughters came and went. However, a core 
group of moms came to define themselves 
as the Abby Lee Dance Company’s original 
wunderkinds, and more deeply, irreplaceable 
in every regard. Melissa Gisoni, Maddie and 
Mackenzie Zeigler’s mother, was known 
for her steadfast support of her children 
and their opportunities. Jill Vertes, Kendall 
Vertes’ mother, was known for championing 
her “Little Kendall’’ at every turn (maybe 
rightfully so at times). Kelly Hyland, mother 
of Paige and Brooke Hyland, dragged 
Abby Lee by her hair during an altercation 
and left the show, though soon after, was 
canonized as one of “Dance Moms” most 
missed and audacious mothers. There was 
Christi Lukasiak, mother of Chloe Lukasiak, 
who was well-cherished for her quick wit, 
objectivity and shrewdness. And lastly, 
and most importantly, there was Dr. Holly 
Hatcher-Frazier, mother of Nia Frazier, most 
known for her integrity, loyalty, care and 
even-minded impeccable class.

In a world where a pandemic is 

restricting the way of life we have always 
known, why has only 18.4% of the United 
States’ population received their first dose of 
the vaccine? Why are a third of Americans 
so uncomfortable and untrusting of the 
vaccine and the vaccine production process 
that could protect us all from an even 
longer painful experience? While 18.4% 
is a disappointing number, according to 
data reported by 35 states on COVID-19 
vaccinations by race/ethnicity, only 7% 
of the Black population has received the 
first dose; in comparison, 13% of white 
Americans, 5% of Hispanics and 11% of Asian 
Americans have received the first dose of 
the vaccine. These statistics are partly due 
to the historical mistrust between the Black 
community and the medical community; a 
mistrust that runs so deep Black Americans 
are skeptical of a vaccine that could slow 
down the spread of COVID-19 which has 
caused 531,000 fatalities in the U.S. alone. 

This 
virus 
has 
disproportionately 

affected minority groups, and yet many 
minorities do not have access to the vaccine 
even if they do have interest. Across the 
country, and especially in the South, 
minorities are forced to drive long distances 
to find a vaccine site. In Dekalb, Ga., Black 
residents are 56% more likely to live over a 
mile away from a vaccine site compared to 
white residents. However, these barriers 
extend beyond the South. In Queens, N.Y., 
Black residents are 106% more likely to live 
over a mile away from a vaccine site.

These statistics speak volumes regarding 

the lack of progress not only in the medical 
industry, but in government as well. Time 
and again, minority communities have 
to go out of their way to receive the care 
they deserve, and in this case the lack of 

transparency surrounding the vaccine due 
to political tension and misinformation 
has not helped calm the nerves of Black 
communities. 

Instead of strictly adhering to scientific 

facts, the vaccine became politicized as 
the year went on, fogging the messages 
communicated by scientists who supervised 
these programs. 

Americans 
never 

received an opportunity to 
become 
comfortable 
with 

the process of the vaccine 
production. 

While 
scientists 
were 

trying to educate the country 
throughout 
the 
creation 

timeline, the political climate 
overshadowed these facts, creating a barrier 
of distrust between the American people 
and the product being sold. One example of 
the issue that is lacking transparency would 
be the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, which 
began in 1932 and concluded in 1972, in which 
medical personnel intentionally prevented 
hundreds of African American men from 
receiving proper care for the sole purpose 
of observing the progression of untreated 
syphilis. The ripple effects of this experiment 
continue to affect Black Americans today 
as the life expectancy of Black men at 45 
fell by 1.5 years, while also discouraging 
Black Americans from receiving medical 
assistance out of fear and a history of 

improper care. Furthermore, the Henrietta 
Lacks story of 1951 is another example 
of medical experimentation without a 
participant’s consent or knowledge. Doctors 
took cells from her cervix when she was 
battling cervical cancer for use in scientific 
research, and her cell harvest led to amazing 

discoveries all at the cost of her comfort, 

her family’s comfort and the comfort 
of Black Americans 
today. 

Many 

more 
stories 
show 
the 

medical 
community 

wielding Black Americans 
as pawns rather than treating 
them as patients who deserve 

great care.

We as a country must get 

to the point where we create a 
nurturing medical environment for 
the Black community, so that there 

may be some confidence in the vaccine 
and medicine in general, which could be 
accomplished through better education 
on the vaccine and complete transparency 
on processes within the medical world. To 
overcome this pandemic, a majority of the 
population, including Black and Brown 
communities, will have to be vaccinated to 
stop other variants. For us to trust our health 
care and our government with our bodies, 
we must be willing to overshare and reach 
out to communities who are systemically 
left out of the equation. Without trust, 
security and honesty, the community’s ties 
with its dark medical past will continue into 
our future.

The four thousand word essay

“The ‘sickness’ of the lover is distinct from 

other illnesses. / Love is the astrolabe of the 
secrets of God.” (Rumi, Masnavi)

Heralded as a great thinker and poet, 

and relevant 800 years later, Rumi is a 
favorite amongst many Americans. His 
verses are plastered on watercolor paintings 
and hung in the homes of many, ultimately 
immortalizing his legacy. Rumi spent much 
of his life learning about Islam; his father 
was an Islamic scholar, he spent some time 
in Syria studying Islamic legal codes and was 
even a seminary teacher in Turkey. More 
notably, his mentor and great friend Sham e 
Tabriz taught Rumi fundamental Sufi ideas, 
which is apparent in his poetry. As a Sufi, 
Rumi put a heavy emphasis on mindfulness, 
or Muraqabah: meditating and contemplating 
the individual’s connection to Allah, being 
in tune with creation’s connection to Allah 
or more divine power and the human 

connection to the systems and flows in the 
natural environment, which is, essentially, an 
Islamic ideal. 

Thus, 
I 
always 
wondered 
why 
a 

Western nation steeped in stereotypes and 
assumptions about minority groups such as 
Muslims had put a Muslim poet on a pedestal. 
And, more importantly, why is Rumi’s 
identity never discussed or acknowledged? 
The reason Rumi’s poetry is popular in 
Western dialogues is that it touches on ideas 
of mindfulness through metaphors of deep, 
everlasting love. However, in Sufi poetry 
traditionally, these metaphors are commonly 
used in comparison to one’s relationship with 
Allah, emphasizing the idea of experiencing 
fulfillment through one’s love for Allah. 
Today’s translations of Rumi’s poetry leave 
out this quintessential Islamic connection 
because it doesn’t fit into the accepted 
narrative. However, Rumi was a Sufi Muslim, 
and Sufi Islamic theology was the main focus 
of his writings. 

For my extended essay (a 4,000-word 

essay per the International Baccalaureate 

coursework), I decided to learn more 
about the Islamic influences in Rumi’s 
works and that of his successors. I chose 
to write about trends present in Sufi 
Islamic poetry over time, analyzing the 
figurative language in three different Sufi 
poets: Rumi; Allama Iqbal, an Indian poet 
who inspired the partition between India 
and Pakistan; and Danial Abdal-Hayy 
Moore, a current Sufi poet who derives his 
message from his experience as a Muslim 
convert. Particularly, I focused on the 
idea of muraqabah. Working to cultivate 
muraqabah can strengthen the connection 
between the individual and Allah, which 
Rumi, Iqbal and Moore all mentioned in 
their literature.

Staying true to my exploration of 

mindfulness, the essay forced me to 
spend long hours reflecting on the idea of 
mindfulness (particularly in the shower). 
After typing the 4,000th word, I let out a 
sigh of relief. I felt satisfied with my work, 
believing I had effectively communicated my 
ideas. 

Six months later, I received my score for 

the essay, which was lower than I expected. 
I was disappointed, but only momentarily, 
because through this essay, I felt I had 
creative freedom for the first time. I relished 
my journey through each poem and my 
newly-founded relationship with muraqabah 
and my spiritual state. I gained a greater 
appreciation for poetry, Sufi ideology and 
myself. Despite the looming score, I’m proud 
of the essay and the message behind it. I 
pointed out the connections between the 
words and muraqabah in Rumi’s poems and 
those of his successors. I argued that this core 
idea is present, was always present and will 
be present in the lines, forever, for if it is Sufi 
poetry, then the language is derived from the 
author’s intuitive connection with Allah. 

Each poem I mentioned introduced a new 

perspective to me of how to view my place 
in this world and my position before Allah. 
Rumi showed me that love and Allah are 
inextricably tied together, and one cannot 
function without the other. Iqbal’s insights 
empowered me to be mindful of the control 

I have over my actions while retaining my 
connection with Allah. Moore illuminated 
to me the importance of being mindful of the 
interconnectedness with the world and Allah.

Though my grade on the piece could have 

controlled me, I chose how it would affect 
me, solidifying destiny for myself. Indeed, 
the score is an indication that I had not been 
writing with perfect clarity and that I had 
not properly implemented a structure to the 
piece. But it also indicates what I gained from 
my journey with mindfulness and poetry, 
which I will always cherish. My favorite verse 
mentioned in the essay is from the book “Bal 
e Jibril” in Urdu — or “Wing of Gabriel” — by 
Allama Iqbal. The verse inspires the reader 
to take charge of themselves and develop 
confidence. The speaker imagines a direct 
conversation with Allah, solidifying control 
over their destiny. 

“Develop the self so that before every decree 

/ God will ascertain from you: ‘What is your 
wish?’ / It is nothing to talk about if I transform 
base selves into gold: / The passion of my voice 
is the only alchemy I know!” (Iqbal, Bal e Jibril)

Is this racism?

Does this qualify

my statements, my actions, my desire for 

change

when I have not faced the darkest depths 

of injustice 

or really ever looked it in the eye

When my most intimate encounter with 

such

might merely be the lies of my own 

internalized fear

of my mom speaking in front of my friends

and in turn

closing the lid of my lunchbox between 

bites

When even the truths of my experiences 

feel less than valid

in all the moments second-guessed 
between the microaggressions and 

ignorant questions and the occasional slur

or jokes and slit-eye drawings that, hey, I 

absorbed without complaint
and after years, mastered the art

of turning my heritage into comic relief 

anyway

And yet it lingers

A conscious shame for looking like myself

one that hurts and that haunts

but never enough for me to speak forth

that I cannot punctuate nor hyperlink nor 

write into prose

that I can only find hidden 

in its ambiguity

perpetually in ambiguity

And then I think 

about Vincent Chin

and Fong Lee
and Cau Tran

all who did not live to see 30 
all who were brutally killed

with a baseball bat, by another white man, 
because of a ten-inch vegetable peeler

by an ebens and an andersen and a 

marshall not serving a day 

but only receiving a medal of valor

And I think

these are not mutually exclusive

they are not at all

and if we quietly teach ourselves to 

compare and repress

instead of to point to the beast underlying

where the common denominator is

an insatiable system that feeds on itself

then who is that serving

And when I mutter to myself 

Is this racism? It can’t be

am I only conflating it with my family’s 

simply being poor

or my unbelonging for a reason attributed 

otherwise

and am I neglecting the shield
of my father’s masters degree

We fall into that trap

and keep our mouths shut

and get lost in the second-guessing

failing to connect the dots 

towards a liberation that coincides

failing when, right now, our 

grandparents

cannot make it home alive

I wonder if our encounters brushed aside 

and history untold or forgotten
has turned into a gaping hole 

of invisibility 
and silence that

only please the white man

Stream of consciousness on a 
Tuesday afternoon, perhaps for 

one Asian American

Black America and the vaccine

By Yoon Kim, MiC Columnist


“The Big Bang Theory” aired on CBS for 

over 12 years, accumulating around 11,700 
minutes of runtime or 195 hours. That’s the 
equivalent of over eight full days of straight 
footage. Even if you didn’t sleep for a week, you 
could not finish the entirety of “The Big Bang 
Theory.” 

The series ran on CBS starting in 2007. The 

sitcom revolved around a group of four geeky 
friends and their inability to assimilate into 
“normal” society. Though highly educated, the 
male cast of the Big Bang Theory is portrayed 
as stereotypical nerds and hopeless with 
women. Throughout the entire run of the 
show, Kaley Cuoco is a series regular. She is 
notable on the show for being the only “normal 
person,” the viewers’ way into the nerdy and 
geeky world of the boys. While there are 
various problematic elements of her character 
and the show’s humor, she had an otherwise 
successful and critically unnotable career.

However, 
“The 
Big 
Bang 
Theory” 

concluded in 2019, with most of the cast 
jumping ship to pursue other interests. Once 
freed from CBS’s “Big Bang” purgatory, Cuoco 
got involved in various new projects. She 
started her own production company in 2017 
called Yes, Norman Productions. Since then, 
Cuoco has starred in and developed multiple 
new and dynamic projects.

In the past year, I have twice encountered 

Cuoco entirely by accident. “The Flight 
Attendant” was released by HBO in 2020 
and won Cuoco a new level of critical acclaim. 
Cuoco works both in front of and behind the 
camera. She is an executive producer behind 
the screen while, onscreen, she plays the 
troubled, boozy protagonist Cassie who gets 
caught up in a larger corporate-spy plot. 

In the show, her character wakes up next 

to her brutally murdered one-night stand in 
Bangkok. The man has his throat completely 
slit open, and party girl Cassie is completely 
unprepared for the sight. Recalling Amanda 
Knox, an American charged with a crime 

abroad who was wrongfully sentenced to 
26 years in an Italian prison, Cassie makes 
the executive decision to clean up the crime 
scene and any evidence of her staying the 
night. Picking up broken glass, Cassie fumbles 
around the apartment, trying to keep her 
hysteria in check.

Cuoco, so often portraying a street-smart, 

“normal” girl in “The Big Bang Theory,” gets 
to stretch her emotions. In a single scene, she 
transforms from a confident, irresponsible 
party girl to scared, traumatized and panicked. 
Cuoco makes this transition convincingly and 
maintains the viewer’s sympathies. 

Most American audiences have seen a 

bevy of crime-solving shows. From “Bones” 
to “CSI,” American audiences know what 
not to do at a crime scene. Cassie breaks all 
the rules. She leaves her fingerprints on the 
murder weapon after picking it up, she trails 
blood across the floor and she answers the 
door to shoo away a maid. However, despite all 
Cassie’s obvious blunders, it’s hard for her not 
to remain a sympathetic character. 

The truest test of Cuoco’s acting ability is 

not her ability to sashay down a hotel lobby, but 
rather her ability to remain relatable during a 
crisis. Watching Cuoco cleaning up a crime 
scene is heart-pounding. She channels the 
right amount of panicked and overwhelmed 
without seeming too tacky or over-acted. She 
calls her network and family, trying to get 
advice without implicating anyone she loves 
in the mess she woke up in. At that moment, 
with the information the show provides, the 
most logical course of action is Cassie’s chosen 
path. Cuoco and the script are able to make a 
convincing case for Cassie’s reactions. Thanks 
to this careful framing, instead of yelling 
at the television, I remained surprisingly 
sympathetic toward Cassie. 

“The Flight Attendant” has enjoyed rave 

reviews since it first aired in November 2020. 
The show, Cuoco and the cast were nominated 
for the Golden Globes this past month. In a 
recent Variety article, Cuoco said that “The 
Flight Attendant” was “the highlight of (her) 
entire career.”

But the real highlight of Cuoco’s career is 

what she did with superhero cartoons.

It’s not often that I completely forget where 

I know an actress or voice from. I pride myself 
on being able to recognize voices and faces 
on screen. When watching animated movies 
and shows, though unable to identify the 
voice actors, I know voices from previous 
characters. Sometimes my ability to discern 
and identify voices ruins the immersion but I 
can shake it off.

Twice Kaley Cuoco has eluded me. The first 

time was in “The Flight Attendant.” The second 
time was in HBO’s “Harley Quinn.” Another 
offering from Cuoco’s production company, 
“Harley Quinn” effectively terraformed the 
comic book media landscape by introducing the 
commercial possibility of feminist, irreverent 
television for comic book fans. Harley Quinn, 
voiced by Cuoco, has her vices: a bad ex (the 
Joker) and something to prove. 

The character is narcissistic and selfish but 

unapologetically so. She is confident in her 
femininity and unafraid of violence. In a way, 
Harley Quinn of the “Harley Quinn” TV show 
is a conceptual predecessor to Cassie in “The 
Flight Attendant.”

Portrayals of Harley Quinn in the DC 

comic book universe can be a mixed bag. 
Sometimes Harley is a seductress, more 
archetype than character. Other times, 
Harley is inscrutable, both victim and 
perpetrator, with motivations unknowable 
to Batman’s cohort. It’s not uncommon for 
Harley to be used as a plot device. Even 
recent comics centering around Harley 
begin with an unsteady understanding 

of who the character is. Comics cannot 
reconcile Harley as a “wild,” sexually 
active, abused woman and simultaneously 
extremely educated. Any portrayal of 
Harley as a multifaceted woman and an 
individual is undercut by the comic book’s 
persistent sexualization of her.

However, in the “Harley Quinn” TV show, 

viewers can understand Harley as a complex 
woman. She is no longer inscrutable with 
vaguely referenced motivations and is 
not simply an insane Joker lackey; she is a 
woman who has made her own choices and 
is learning to live with herself. The show 
picks up right after the Joker and Harley 
have broken up for the last time. Harley is 

distraught and she throws a fit, unable to be 
comforted by her close friend Poison Ivy.

Similar to Cassie, Harley is not a great 

person. Both women have made many 
mistakes and hurt people close to them, 
repeatedly engaging in compulsive, harmful 
behavior. But even in crisis, both women 
remain real and sympathetic. Harley’s 
struggle to define herself apart from her 
disastrous relationship with the Joker feels 
natural. What else characterizes one’s mid-
20s if not messy, modern relationships and 
having to grapple with enormous emotions 
that feel too large for our bodies? Harley 
makes mistake after mistake but she’s 
undergoing a learning process. She is fallible 
and sympathetic.

In creating an unapologetically loud and 

vulgar female-lead superhero cartoon show, 
“Harley Quinn” breaks the male-fantasy 
comic book tropes in half. From the canon 
of the DC Universe, “Harley Quinn” pieces 
together a modern narrative that bridges 
continuity gaps and isn’t afraid to laugh 
at the source material’s idiosyncrasies. 
The show is similar to “The Lego Batman 
Movie” in that it acutely understands 
Batman’s role in popular culture. Comic 
book writers tend to take Batman incredibly 
seriously. They see the billionaire in tights 
as 
regimented 
and 
silently 
tortured. 

“Harley Quinn” understands Batman as a 
workaholic. The show is LGBTQ+ inclusive 
and absolutely hilarious to watch. Under 
Cuoco’s leadership, it proves DC comics’ 
audience is composed of more than the 
“stereotypical geek” characters in “Big Bang 
Theory.” Geeky girls and so-called “normal” 
girls alike consume superhero narratives. I 
often pass it along to my non-DC comic fan 
friends as their first foray into comic book 
media.

From sit-com to 2D animation, Cuoco 

has a lot to offer. More so than merely being 
a versatile actress, Cuoco shakes up the 
industry. “The Big Bang Theory” made Cuoco 
a household name, but “The Flight Attendant” 
and “Harley Quinn” show is Cuoco’s legacy 
thus far.

8 — Wednesday, March 17, 2021 

John Mayer has worn many different 

labels over the last 20 years — popstar, guitar 
virtuoso, songwriter, comedian, talk show 
host, 
heartthrob, 
douchebag, 
pompous, 

misogynist, abuser. These labels create an 
ever-present maelstrom around Mayer, a war 
between those who hate him and those who 
love him.

When Mayer made a TikTok account last 

week, the response he received was less than 
enthusiastic. The maelstrom raged in his 
comments: Taylor Swift fans had discovered 
his account. They were quick to remember 
Swift’s song “Dear John,” where she wrote 
about their relationship in a less than flattering 
light. 

“John don’t you think 19 was too young?” — 

16.2k likes; “the original indie boy gaslighter” 
— 8.5k likes; “hello mr old man victim 
complex” — 51k likes; “funny how taylor’s 
one song about you is better than your entire 
discography” — 2.6k likes.

By Mayer’s third and fourth post, his fans 

fought back in the comments: 

“People really don’t understand this dude is 

one of the most talented guitar players of our 
time” — 25.7k likes; “Y’all actin like John isnt a 
musical legend” — 6.8k likes; “at the end of the 
day he’s still one of the best songwriters of the 
last 100 years” — 2.8k likes

This war of opinions over John Mayer is not 

unique to TikTok. Look up his name on Google 
or Twitter and you’ll see a hodgepodge of 
articles and tweets saying one thing or another 

about Mayer. (My personal favorite was the 
headline “Is John Mayer a douchebag?” It’s the 
question mark for me.) I encountered shades of 
this split opinion when it was announced that 
I was writing this article to some other editors 
on The Daily, with more than one person 
expressing their genuine dislike for Mayer. 

The debate around Mayer mainly boils 

down to two groups: those who condemn 
Mayer for his actions, and those who celebrate 
him for his musical achievements. Yet, within 
these two groups, the line between person and 
musician is often blurred.

It is common to hear someone who doesn’t 

like John Mayer for, well, being John Mayer, 
also say that his music is bad. Exhibit A can be 
seen in the above TikTok comment, “funny 
how taylor’s one song about you is better than 
your entire discography.” And yes, I get that 
these are TikTok comments with about 10 
layers of irony on top of them, but I think it’s 
reasonable to say that there is some reflection 
of real thought and belief behind them. That, 
although the comment was likely just written 
as a joke, there is an underlying belief that 
because Mayer is allegedly a bad person, he’s 
also a bad musical artist.

Among guitarists, there are those who still 

view Mayer as just someone who writes pop 
songs. They see him as someone who’s basic, 
someone who isn’t a true guitarist because he 
appeals to a large audience. You’ll often find 
that those who say this are also quick to bring 
up Mayer’s past relationships and what has 
been written about them as proof that not only 
is he “just a popstar,” but he’s also the typical 
popstar. The type of popstar who goes around 
LA partying. They use this assumption of who 

he is as evidence that he makes basic, bland 
music. Because that’s what popstars do, right?

For people who like Mayer, saccharine 

levels of adulation can exist. To call him one of 
the best songwriters of the last 100 years is, of 
course, a bit hyperbolic. On his subreddit, one 
user said that they watched his new TikTok 
video “15 times” because it was “so funny.” 
I mean take a look at that video I just linked. 
It was moderately amusing, but to watch 
it 15 times? Really? Many of his hardcore 
supporters refer to him affectionately as just 
“John” and they’re eager to point out that not 
only is he a fantastic guitarist, but he’s also a 
great person for reason X, Y and Z.

When I started writing this article I found 

myself falling into a bit of the same trap.

I wanted to write about Mayer as a 

musician. How when he started playing guitar 
as a teenager, he became so obsessed with it 
that his parents took him to see a psychiatrist 
twice. How he went to Berklee College of 
Music, dropped out after a year and within 
four years was signed to a major record label.

I wanted to write about his range as a 

musician. How he’s touched everything 
from pop to blues to folk to country. How he’s 
performed and collaborated with all-time great 
guitarists B.B. King and Eric Clapton, among 
others. How Eric Clapton, the second-best 

guitarist of all time according to Rolling Stone, 
said “I don’t think he even knows how good he 
is.”

I wanted to write about how, while Mayer’s 

most well known for his pop records, he 
currently tours with Dead & Company, a spin-
off of the Grateful Dead. Dead & Company are 
anything but pop. Their concerts are basically 
long, improvisational jam sessions filled with 
solos for every member on stage. Each song 
they play is different every night. If touring 
with Dead & Company as the lead guitarist 
isn’t an indication of being a great musician, 
I’m not sure what is.

I wanted to write about John Mayer as a 

songwriter. In an age where if you go into the 
Top 50 on Spotify, it seems like almost every 
song has about 25 different writers. But every 
single Mayer song has one name next to it: 
John Mayer. 

The albums and songs he’s written have 

so much range and variety that he’s easily 
my most listened to artist, because he can 
fit practically any mood. I can listen to a face 
melting solo from the bluesy “Slow Dancing in 
a Burning Room,” cry to “Wheel” or dance to 
“New Light.” When I’m playing music for my 
Kansas-raised parents, “Roll it on Home,” a 
song with country twang, is one of their most 
requested songs. It feels as though whatever 
type of music Mayer tries to make, he masters.

Then I wanted to write about John Mayer 

the person. I wanted to make a case that, you 
know what, Mayer had changed. He was this 
and now he’s this. 

On Jan. 31, 2010, Taylor Swift won a 

Grammy Award for Album of the Year with 
her sophomore album, Fearless, the most 
awarded country album in history. 

On Feb. 15, 2016, Taylor Swift won a 

Grammy Award for Album of the Year for her 
fifth album, 1989, making her the first female 
artist in history to win the highly coveted 
award twice. 

On March 14, 2021, Taylor Swift will be the 

favorite to win a Grammy Award for Album of 
the Year for her eighth album, folklore, which 
would make her the first female artist in 
history to win this award three times and the 
first artist to win Album of the Year for albums 
of three different genres — country, pop and 
alternative. If nothing else could convince 
you that Taylor Swift has range — epitomizes 
range, really — that should. 

Taking a walk down memory lane and her 

timeline of albums only furthers the point.

Even when Taylor Swift was solely 

a country singer, she still had range, 
transitioning between being hopelessly in 
love on her debut single “Tim McGraw” to 
scathing and unforgiving in “Picture to Burn” 
— and those are just on her self-titled debut 

album. Following that, she broke countless 
records and made history many times over 
with the variety of songs, sounds and themes 
that is Fearless. From her wistful “Romeo and 
Juliet”-themed song “Love Story” (one of her 
most well-known songs among fans and non-
fans alike) to the heartbreaking track “White 
Horse” to the iconic “You Belong With Me,” 
Swift exemplified range. 

With Speak Now, she continued to prove 

that she was not just a one-note country singer, 
offering sad songs for her fans to relate to 
(“Dear John” and “Never Grow Up”) along 
with head-banging bops, like “Haunted” and 
“Sparks Fly.”

And then you reach her fourth album Red, 

which, in many ways, can’t be categorized. 
Charts and streaming services label it as her 
fourth country album, but Red is truly a genre 
of its own. Centering around the titular color, 
Swift managed to encapsulate every feeling 
and thought that you could ever associate with 
red: petty anger (“We Are Never Ever Getting 
Back Together”), painful, scarring sadness 
(“All Too Well”), incandescent joy (“22”) and 
so much more. While many critics scoff at 
Red’s lack of sonic cohesion, that’s exactly the 
point. The songs aren’t supposed to sound the 
same because the color red never means the 
same thing twice. 

When you enter Swift’s pop eras, her 

musical range grows. Though 1989 was her 
first obviously pop album, she created it like 
she’d been writing pop muswic her whole 
life. And then, following her “disappearance” 
in 2016, she returned with an album that 
was the antithesis to 1989: reputation. The 
popstar-princess colors of 1989 turned into 
blacks, golds and greens as she said “Look 
What You Made Me Do” and became the 
snake that others accused her of being. 
Somehow, following that, she made another 
180 with pastel-tinged Lover, that had a love 
song for every kind of love there is. 1989 and 
reputation are opposites, without a doubt, and 
yet reputation and Lover are equally distinct 
… but 1989 and Lover sound as different from 
each other as two albums ever could. Does that 
spell out range to you? 

And then you reach today: folklore and 

evermore, two sister albums that are similar 
in how they turn inward and feature thematic 
messages but differ so vastly from one another. 
Where folklore is grayscale sadness, depth and 
lessons learned, evermore is the earth-toned 
soundtrack to fictional story after story. 

Only Taylor Swift could change her 

whole persona (and Instagram feed) as she 
switches from black-and-white newsprint 
to bubblegum pastels to woodsy grays and 
browns, 
transitioning 
between 
sounds, 

albums and stories, so effortlessly.

Even as she changes her sound, her 

outfits and her musical genres, she remains 
true to herself always, as evidenced by her 
songwriting and story-telling abilities that 
have never once faltered from Taylor Swift 
to evermore. Her music and sound may have 
range — pivoting from one thing to another as 
she grew up, learned lessons and found herself 
— but her lyrics never waver. They only grow 
stronger. 

Sometimes I wonder where she’ll go next. 

In some ways, it feels like she’s done all there 

is to do when it comes to music. Every Taylor 
Swift album/era feels like a complete reversal 
of what she previously did, and how many 
more times can a person do that? She never 
seems to run out of themes to embody or songs 
to create. But knowing Taylor Swift, her 10th 
studio album (not including her rerecordings) 
is going to be just as different, just as new, as all 
of her past endeavors. 

To say that Taylor Swift has range is, 

frankly, an understatement. In actuality, she is 
range. She personifies it. She owns it.

Remember the “Cheese Touch”?
You know what I’m talking about. 

It was 2011. You were nine years old. 
You were on the bus ride back home, 
settled into your assigned seat and 
beginning to zone out, dreaming 
about your 30 minutes of allotted 
computer time on Poptropica that 
night. 

Suddenly, you felt a violent jab 

into the back of your arm. A smug-
sounding classmate then shouted 
“Cheese Touch!” in your ear, their 
voice dripping with ridicule, plus an 
undertone of relief. “Crossies!” 

Panic sets in. You turn around to 

view the offender, and they hold up 
their crossed fingers to your face to 
prove their immunity. The middle 
section of the bus explodes with 
laughter. You quickly search around 
to see everyone’s faces. They taunt you 
by rapidly holding up their crossed 
fingers, laughing. Desperate to get rid 
of the Cheese Touch, you scan the bus 
for any unsuspecting bystanders on 
which to pass off your deadly touch. 

Remember that nightmare? Well, 

we have one person to thank for 
that. Surprisingly, we have the same 
person to thank for your 30 minutes 
of allotted time on Poptropica: Jeff 
Kinney.

Initially a newspaper cartoonist 

in college, Jeff Kinney’s comics were 
criticized for looking too much like 
those of a “seventh-grader.” Citing 
the Peter Principle, Kinney decided to 
lean into his (perceived lack of) style. 

Now, Kinney is the author of “Diary 
of a Wimpy Kid,” one of the world’s 
most widely consumed children’s 
series, and the creator of Poptropica, 
the incredibly famous role-player 
gaming website for kids. He also owns 
a bookstore in Plainville, Mass., with 
his wife Julie. Talk about range! 

Kinney’s work is far-reaching — his 

series can be found at any book fair. 
However, children’s media experts 
and English teachers rarely seem to 
hold it in high regard. In fifth grade, 
my favorite English teacher Mr. 
Jonathan bemoaned the members 
of our class (including me) who read 
“Stick-Man,” as he called it. Too 
often, “Wimpy Kid” is seen as too 
“low-brow” to engage with (without, 
at least, some semblance of shame). 
However, I disagree: I think the 
“Wimpy Kid” series is a masterpiece 
on many levels. 

Let’s not put on airs: we read 

the book for its humor (mostly 
situational 
comedy, 
with 
a 

tasteful sprinkle of barf jokes). 
Greg, a tween assured of his 
own greatness, regularly tries to 
manipulate others, like his best 
friend Rowley, as well as his family, 
into doing his bidding. He fails a lot. 
Greg pretends his arm is broken to 
get sympathy, ridicules Rowley and 
concocts schemes for his crush, 
Holly Hills, to pay attention to him. 
These behaviors indicate a healthy 
dose of adolescent narcissism — 
Greg is manipulative, selfish and, 
honestly, kind of a jerk. However, 
anyone who remembers the ordeals 
of middle school knows what it feels 
like to fight their way through these 

grades — to tweens, this behavior 
might even seem normal. 

“It really captures the struggle of a 

child that age trying to figure out what 
it means to be a person,” Dr. Joshua 
Sparrow, a psychiatrist at Harvard 
Medical School, said in an interview 
with the New York Times. Greg 
definitely isn’t the best role model. 
He can be ridiculously terrible, yet, at 
times, relatable. 

However, it brings the unreliable 

narrator trope to mind: If Greg cannot 
be trusted, can his storytelling? Upon 
further examination, Greg’s problems 
seem very obvious to everyone except 
him. His accounts of constant jealousy 
of his younger brother, Manny (who 
represents everything Greg hopes to 
be), his desperation to play the victim 
when speaking to his older brother, 
Rodrick (who really didn’t do much 
wrong) and his constant dismissal 
of both Rowley and his mother (who 
make efforts to bond with him) feel 
one-sided. Greg, trapped in a prison of 

his own mind where he tries and fails 
to manipulate others, would do well to 
care about those around him. Maybe, 
were he to gain empathy for the 
people in his life, Greg’s never-ending 
cycle of manipulation would end, and 
he would finally graduate middle 
school. Kinney’s characterization of 
Greg feels simple and complex at the 
same time.

In elementary school, I ran to the 

Scholastic Book Fair during lunch to 
read the latest release. Today, “Wimpy 
Kid” still enthralls kids. It’s rare not to 
see a Wimpy Kid book at the top of the 
Children’s Bestseller List. Jeff Kinney 
might not be a household name, but 
Greg Heffley certainly is.

Less people know about Kinney’s 

involvement 
with 
Poptropica, 

launched in 2007, the same year the 
first “Wimpy Kid” was published in 
print. Many people are surprised to 
find out Kinney is the developer and 
creative director, despite spending 
countless hours on the website in their 

childhood. If “Wimpy Kid” feels like 
the continuation of one long story, 
Poptropica is the opposite: users jump 
from island to island, each containing 
its own interactive story that involves 
a quest, many of which are written by 
Kinney. 

Poptropica’s 
iconic 
character 

design, for which characters’ faces are 
sideways ellipses, with large blinking 
eyes, one slightly larger than the other 
depending on which way the camera 
is facing, is recognizable anywhere. 
Poptropica continues to live in a 
nostalgic class of online media for 
many late millennials and early Gen-
Zers, alongside websites like Webkinz 
and Club Penguin. In the ultimate 
super-mega 
nostalgia-extreme 

crossover of the decade, Kinney even 
created two “Wimpy Kid” islands 
within Poptropica, with storylines 
based on helping Greg babysit Manny 
and other cool, fun stuff. 

I have many fond memories of 

playing 
Poptropica, 
specifically 

the Greek Mythology island which 
coincided with one of my other 
childhood interests: the children’s 
book series “Percy Jackson and the 
Olympians,” written by Rick Riordan, 
with whom Kinney happens to be 
friends. It took me two years (and a 
lot of online tutorials) to get past the 
Underworld in Greek Mythology 
Island — this is not something I 
admit freely. Embarrassingly, over 
quarantine, 
I’ve 
started 
playing 

Poptropica again, and I’m still 
struggling with completing many of 
the quests. 

Kinney’s work isn’t without its 

faults. One wonders if Kinney has 

anything to gain artistically from 
continuing to publish seemingly 
indiscernible 
stories 
of 
Greg. 

Additionally, no one can forget 
Chirag Gupta (personally, my self-
insert character), the only person of 
color in his books, who was literally 
gaslighted into believing he was 
invisible and then deaf (I can’t make 
this up). Despite these flaws, Kinney’s 
varied body of work somehow has a 
kiddish, comfortable charm to it — it 
feels safe. 

To discuss the topic of evolution, 

it’s essential to note Kinney’s relative 
consistency after creating Poptropica. 
Kinney has been publishing the 
“Wimpy Kid” series since 2007 — of 
which there are 15 books (Yes! 15!). 
Greg and company have stayed in the 
same suburban middle school for 14 
years now. In Poptropica, while new 
islands and an app have been released, 
the overall feel has stayed the same. 
In an extremely short period, Kinney 
went through an intense multimedia 
ideation period that spawned cultural 
touchstones. Since then, Kinney 
hasn’t created any new franchises; 
with 
two 
long-lived, 
financially 

lucrative projects, he stays busy. 

However, to call him stagnant 

would 
be 
unfair. 
Within 
his 

established projects, he continues to 
expand worlds familiar to us. He’s 
created new story-based islands in 
Poptropica. He’s made a Rowley 
spin-off series within the “Diary of a 
Wimpy Kid” universe. It seems to be 
what Kinney does best as an artist: 
create an immersive world that is 
untouched by the passage of time, and 
flesh it out for years to come.

A few weeks ago, I was listening 

to music with my roommates on a 
Friday night. Much to their chagrin, 
I ended up controlling Spotify and 
turned on a playlist with some of my 
favorites. My close friend stopped me 
as Lauryn Hill’s “Ex-Factor” started 
and said, “This is from a Drake song!” 
Drake, who in 2012 called himself 
“the first person to successfully rap 
and sing,” was borrowing from one 
of the unsung pioneers of the hip-hop 
genre. It saddens me that most of us 
know Hill from her samples on tracks 
written by those who benefit from the 
style of hip-hop she pioneered. 

Lauryn Hill, whose work precedes 

that of artistically acclaimed rappers 
like 
Kendrick 
Lamar, 
is 
often 

overlooked as the originator of the 
hip-hop/soul genre, with beautiful 
instrumentation, impressive vocals 
and amazing flow. Her work seems 
to have been lost in the ’90s, when 
The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was 
released. So how did this example of 
sweeping range that revolutionized 
hip-hop get lost?

Hill rose to fame through her 1992 

band The Fugees, which she formed 
with Wyclef Jean and Pras Michel. 
The band found immense commercial 
success and critical acclaim with 
the release of their 1996 sophomore 
album The Score. Hill, specifically, 
was praised for her interpretation of 

Roberta Flack’s “Killing Me Softly 
With His Song,” which blended 
hip-hop, 
reggae 
and 
Caribbean 

influences while at the same time 
maintaining elements of the original 
soul. Additionally, Hill showed her 
versatility with her verse on “Ready 
or Not,” in which she showcased her 
hip-hop credentials by rapping along 
to Jean. Overall, the band showcased 
a new neo-soul sense that blended 
Jean’s Jamaican roots with Hill’s vocal 
abilities and hip-hop background, but 
Hill specifically began her journey as 
a versatile artist. 

The Fugees disbanded in 1997 

due to internal strife between Jean 
and Hill. This separation would 
bring Hill’s greatest work yet, in 
the form of an album and style 
that would revolutionize the music 
industry. In 1998, Hill released The 
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, her 
debut and only solo album. The 
album opens with audio of a school 
bell, and we hear conversations 
about love between the “students.” 
Every track ends with audio from 
one of these conversations, which 
describe the experience of love as 
a Black woman. Presumably, Hill 
herself is one of the students, getting 
“re-educated” after her titular 
“miseducation” about love. 

The album’s opener, “Lost Ones,” 

shows Hill’s rap prowess right out of 
the gate, establishing her abilities in 
the more traditional hip-hop genre. 
However, as we move through the 
album we hear Hill mix genres that 

she’d never fully dipped into during 
her time with The Fugees. Her range 
starts to shine through on “Ex-Factor,” 
where she pairs beautiful rhythm and 
blues vocals and instrumentation 
with rap. 

“Ex-Factor” is the type of track 

that blends so many genres it feels 
like you’re listening to every song 
on a diverse album, but the blending 
is seamless. Hill incorporates the 
guitar skills of artist Carlos Santana 

on “To Zion,” an ode to her firstborn 
son, incorporating Latin jazz into her 
style. Arguably her most famous song, 
“Doo Wop (That Thing)” showcases 
her rapping and singing prowess in 
another genre-mixing song, filled 

with the warnings of things that she 
was never warned against in her 
“miseducation” on life and love. 

We do see Hill divert into the “true” 

genres that she utilizes, specifically on 
her ballad track “The Miseducation 

of Lauryn Hill,” her R&B anthem 
in “Nothing Even Matters” and her 
more pure rap style on tracks like 
“Every Ghetto, Every City.” Hearing 
the record takes the listener across the 
entire musical spectrum, yet it always 

comes together thanks to a touch that 
is distinct to Hill. 

Women 
are 
often 
dismissed 

in the hip-hop world due to their 
gender, and it can feel like they have 
to choose their styles very explicitly. 

Women in hip hop who write about 
sexuality, like Cardi B, are dismissed 
as cheap shots despite men rapping 
about these same topics for decades. 
Hill’s range on Miseducation goes 
beyond musical range: She addresses 
a variety of topics related to her 
experience as a Black woman. Hill’s 
decision to mix styles and messages 
changed what it means to be a hip-
hop artist — a woman in hip-hop — 
and these changes are still felt today. 

Consider Kendrick Lamar’s To 

Pimp a Butterfly from 2015: Mixing 
jazz instrumentals with a spoken-
word style of rap and featuring 
artists from a variety of backgrounds 
felt revolutionary and fresh because 
of how well it was executed. But 
after listening to Miseducation, one 
quickly realizes that it all started 
with Hill’s style and fearlessness in 
mixing and mastering a spectrum of 
themes and disciplines. 

Understanding 
the 
influence 

of Lauryn Hill on the music 
industry and the groundbreaking 
impact of her debut album is key 
in recognizing the development of 
music at large. So the next time you 
listen to modern hip-hop and enjoy 
the now-popular style of blending 
vocals and rap, don’t forget the 
artists who started it. 

Lauryn Hill’s legacy deserves to 

be one of an artist who pioneered a 
style years before it caught on and 
beautifully 
mastered 
individual 

disciplines across an immense 
range.

Basement Arts has a longstanding 

reputation 
for 
showcasing 
the 

talents of University of Michigan 
actors and directors; it occupies 
the upper echelon of student-run 
theater 
organizations. 
Basement 

Arts’s collaboration with Blank Space 
Workshop, a student organization 
dedicated to showcasing the work of 
emerging playwrights, has been much 
anticipated. Unfortunately, the debut 
performance of this collaborative 
effort, “SHE,” fails to measure up.

Devised and directed by Music, 

Theatre & Dance junior Claire Vogel, 
Basement Arts’s short film “SHE” was 
conceived with one purpose in mind: 
To create a feminist play. Narrative 
and characterization are left by the 
wayside in favor of neon lights and 
funky eyeshadow. The production 
relies far too heavily on aesthetic, but 
aesthetic alone does not make a play. 
To paraphrase prominent YA author 
Rainbow Rowell, “Art isn’t supposed 
to look nice, it’s supposed to make you 
feel something.” 

And while the mere feat of making 

a play look “nice” and maintaining 
production value is nothing to scoff at 
during the era of Zoom plays and radio 
dramas, these efforts were wasted 

on a hackneyed feminist manifesto 
devoid of soul.

For a play whose only aim is to 

celebrate femininity, the script is 
remarkably tone-deaf. In the hour-
long film, trans women and BIPOC 
women are only mentioned once. 
I might add that they are clumped 
together in the same monologue, a 
thinly-veiled tokenization of these 
women and their experiences. That 
monologue, two minutes long at 
most, is the most intersectional 
feminism you’re going to get from this 
production. 

The rest are cringy montages of 

women “indulging” in junk food, 
comparing their bodies to numerous 
species of flora and defining their 
femininity by the way men treat and 
view them. In light of the tragedies of 
the past year, which disproportionately 
affected trans women and women of 
color, these tacky technicolor tales ring 
particularly distasteful. The heyday 
of trans-exclusive white feminism is 
long behind us, yet “SHE” continues to 
glorify it. 

If 
“SHE” 
seeks 
to 
promote 

unification 
and 
sisterhood, 
it 

succeeds. However, this sisterhood is 
only available to a privileged few. The 
cast is fairly homogeneous in terms of 
representation of varying identities 
— comprised almost entirely of thin, 
white, cisgender women.

That being said, the piece certainly 

has its virtues. In a powerful 
monologue, School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance freshman Emilia Vizachero 
details the role of a white woman’s 
tears in perpetuating racist myths 
about the danger men of color pose. 
This is perhaps one of my favorite 
pieces in the play, closely followed by 
Music, Theatre & Dance freshman 
Victoria Vourkoutiotis’s performance 
of a piece detailing the concerted 
erasure 
of 
same-gender 
sexual 

partners.

The level of performance from 

the actors and musicians involved 
was 
consistently 
strong, 
with 

beautiful renditions of “Armor” 
by Sara Bareilles and “Girls Just 
Wanna Have Fun” by Cyndi Lauper 
— the delivery is as good as it 
possibly could be given the intrinsic 
weakness of the script. 

Perhaps the greatest failure of 

“SHE” is its inability to develop 
any sort of narrative or character 
development (and this is coming 
from someone whose favorite 
contemporary 
playwright 
is 

Samuel Beckett). I adore the 
theater of doing nothing. I live 
for people lollygagging on stage 
and simultaneously evoking the 
meaninglessness of existence. I 
am in love with artistic genius 
masquerading as nonsense. What 

I cannot stand is nonsense that 
masquerades as artistic genius.

Simply put, a plethora of free-

verse 
similes 
comparing 
your 

genitalia to various types of flora is 
not brave. It’s boring.

It generalizes, it does little to 

build character and it utilizes 
talented actors as little more than 
talking paintings. It is a love letter 
to white feminism, and frankly, it’s 
one I’m tired of reading.

Ultimately, 
feminism 
doesn’t 

exist in a vacuum: It’s a situational 
response to both subjective and 
generalized oppression. The great 
existential 
philosopher 
Simone 

de Beauvoir asserts that “one is 
not born, but rather becomes, a 
woman.” 

“SHE” ignores the second part 

of this statement entirely. It focuses 
on the mantras, the stereotypes and 
the mores. It not only suppresses the 
experiences of any type of woman 
outside of the cis-heterosexual, white 
cultural norm, but it erases what can 
be considered one of the chief defining 
characteristics 
of 
the 
feminine 

experience: its subjectivity.

We cannot create a common 

narrative of femininity because it 
does not exist. You cannot reduce 
the female experience to a handful 
of cherry-picked narratives that you 
deem pretty enough and palatable 

enough to write about. If we attempt 
to define feminism within certain 
parameters, we will fail time and time 
again. The theatrical arts hold the 
utmost privilege in their ability to be 
subjective. No great play has ever been 
written with the intent of universality. 

Theater is powerful because 

it allows us to understand and 
empathize with those who are 

unlike us. Hence, attempting to 
create shapeless narratives and 
vapid characters serves no one. I 
am a white feminist, and my story 
has been told time and time again. I 
want to understand someone else’s 
story. Maybe it’s time we ditch our 
eyeshadow and neon lights; maybe 
it’s time to step aside and listen to 
someone else for a change.

10 — Wednesday, March 17, 2021

There is a kind of clarity about oneself 

that comes with empathy. Something about 
examining yourself in the way you respond 
to others, in the emotional exchange that 
is shared when you feel keenly what those 
around you are feeling, that provides clarity. 
Alice Phoebe Lou, as she discussed in an 
interview with The Daily, is an empath, 
something apparent in her music. The 
South African-born, Berlin-based free spirit 
smiled while ruminating on this, giving a 
nervous laugh that worked hard not to give 
away the seriousness of her words. Her 
catalogue of music reflects this balance; 
it is tempting to categorize her music as 
folk, save for its luminescent touches of 
interstellar space. Her music creates space 
in a way that is reminiscent of Jamie Drake, 
and her voice shines similarly to another 
blonde otherworldly being, Joni Mitchell. 
And yet, her music escapes the genres that 
would pin it down.

Glow, her new album, was a change 

in sound, in part due to it being recorded 
entirely on tape and because it’s full of love 
songs. “Especially with this album, what I’m 
trying to do or communicate with the songs 
is being able … to try and help somebody get 
more in touch with their own emotions and 
their own feelings, which I feel is a gift,” 
Lou told The Daily. She described music 
as a catalyst for seeing within yourself, as 
everyone is at different stages of connecting 
with themselves. The new album is languid, 
not rushing the listener into or out of love, 
but allowing them to explore the feelings it 
inspires at that moment in time.

Intriguingly, she had a specific goal 

for her listeners with this new work — to 
make them feel. However, there is a careful 
balance between her musical needs and the 
listeners’ expectations. 

“I used to focus too much on the listener,” 

she admitted. “As I was writing the songs, 
I was adjusting things, or censoring things 
or making things more palatable, based on 
like, wanting the listener to be happier with 
the final product, or … anticipating what 
somebody wants from you, rather than just 
giving what you want.”

That has changed. There is certainly a 

sense of newfound self-confidence on this 
record. In fact, this LP is a total change in 
sound from her previous two. Although the 
songs are mostly about another person — 
as love songs often are — they are entirely 
Alice. To be able to connect to your own 
truest self through your love for another is 
a special thing. And finding the right way to 

express it? Well, that’s the challenge. 

In the past, Lou explained, “I was always 

looking to, like, one of the men in the room 
to kind of … take over and, and steer (the 
music).” Now, however, she has found an 
important reason to trust her own musical 
intuition. “It’s my story. It’s my thing,” she 
asserts. How can she truly write about what 
she feels, if she is not more vocal in how it is 
executed?

This aforementioned dip in confidence 

arose mainly from her lack of professional 
training musically. Lou began as a street 
performer, 
busking 
with 
her 
guitar 

(although she casually mentioned that 
she was first a fire dancer). Everything 
in her musical journey happened quickly 
without giving her the space to master 
her instrument. Even though there are 
times when she feels self-conscious about 
this, it also works to her advantage. This is 
especially so when hanging with her band, 
who are all trained musicians. 

“We learn from each other and bring 

different things to the table, because the fact 
that I don’t have a musical education also 
helps me see a bit outside of the box of like, 
this is how a song is supposed to sound,” she 
told The Daily. 

Her atypical way of looking at music is 

part of what creates her singular sound. “It 
becomes this kind of unique sound, and this 
unique thing, my band is able to kind of, you 
know, create the worlds in which we live, 
because of … the things that they’ve learned 
more technically from music,” she said. “So I 
feel like we learn so much from each other.” 

This reciprocal education was vital to an 

element of her music that has always pulled 
me in: its playfulness. Even when her music 
covers serious topics, it always has a corner 
of a smile beneath. At its most joyful, it feels 

like a laugh that simply can’t be repressed — 
something too good to be true, so much so 
that it evokes a physical response. 

“I started becoming very serious about 

everything, and everything had to be like, 
a serious thing,” she admitted, in the midst 
of praising her band for saving her from 
this mindset. They reminded her that the 
goal is to enjoy, and that mistakes can be 
laughed over. This sort of easy happiness 
has underlined her music before, most 
notably the play on orgasm noises in her 
breakout song, “Something Holy.” Now on 
her new album, love takes on a more quiet 
seriousness, and a notable queerness. “Dusk,” 
the lead single from Glow, croons to a loved 
one, using female pronouns to refer to the 
individual. Lou wishes to leave this song up to 
interpretation, keeping the kind of love being 
sung about ambiguous. She likes to keep her 
songs and herself undefined. 

“I don’t like to make the meanings too 

obvious or didactic,” she ventured. “Because 
then it kind of breaks the magic of like, your 
own agency of interpretation.” 

Lou makes her music for herself, to 

express her experiences. But once it is out 
in the world, there is a beauty in it that it 
gives everyone something different. It is not 
her song, she emphasized, but hers and all 
listeners. This is the importance of art in our 
everyday lives — the meaning we get from it. 

“I feel like sometimes I just have this 

desire for my music and my songs to be 
like a friend that can relate to those parts of 
yourself,” Lou mulled over in our discussion 
of self confidence. 

“If maybe you live in a family or a 

community or an environment that doesn’t 
serve you in that way and doesn’t actually 
allow you to … take away the shame.”

Alice Phoebe Lou’s Glow is out March 19.

Basement Arts’s production of 

“Jesus Corner,” written and directed 
by Music, Theatre & Dance freshman 
Samuel Aupperlee, is as splendid as it is 
strange. The one-man show, starring 
Music, Theatre & Dance senior Kieran 
Westphal as narrator, draws from 
real-life accounts of people reckoning 
their sexual identities with their 
Christian faith. The subject matter 
is inherently tricky to grapple with, 
yet the joint efforts of Westphal and 
Aupperlee prove to be an artistic tour-
de-force.

The production uses documentary-

style theatre — much of the content is 
drawn from real-life interviews with 
people who identify as both Christian 
and LGBTQ+. These perspectives 

are shared through a “Mister Rogers’ 
Neighborhood” style children’s show, 
in which the unnamed narrator 
interviews 
puppets 
about 
their 

experiences.

The use of handmade puppets to 

explain Christianity, homosexuality 
and where they intersect, is one 
fraught with potential for either 
extraordinary failure or extraordinary 
success. After all, we rarely associate 
religiously-motivated 
homophobia 

with sock puppets. Nevertheless, 
“Jesus Corner” pulls it off.

Westphal’s peppy delivery and 

colorful puppets contrast sharply 
with the heavy subject matter. The 
protagonist named Narrator presents 
us with three puppets periodically 
throughout the show. One of them, 
Pastor Meaning, is a snake puppet 
in a pastor’s uniform (the biblical 
irony isn’t lost on me). He appears 

periodically to explain doctrinal 
truths, especially those outlining 
what it means to be “good.” The 
show starts out with a relatively 
friendly tone, the presentation seems 
good-naturedly 
cheesy. 
Narrator 

explains to the “boys and girls” that 
God’s love is unconditional, but that 
homosexuality is a sin. 

The first half of “Jesus Corner” 

is intentionally evasive in the way 
it discusses the struggles of being a 
gay Christian. The puppets do what 
puppets do best: They sugarcoat. 
The sermon repeats the mantras 
that many a pastor has reiterated 
in the past decade, those detailing 
the inherent conditionality in God’s 
love — “Hate the sin, love the sinner” 
rhetoric. There is a palpable tonal shift 
when Narrator’s puppets One and 
Two detail their experiences coming 
out to their parents. The dialogue 

starts out lightly, but quickly takes 
a grim turn when Two’s parents 
decide to ignore their homosexuality 
completely. “They say come as you 
are, but they don’t really want that,” 
Two says.

As the puppets tell their stories, 

the manner in which the Narrator 
portrays 
the 
puppets 
becomes 

increasingly erratic. It is heavily 
implied that he too is struggling with 
his sexual identity, which becomes 
evident as the characters of the 
puppets fade away. 

The stage directions detail that the 

puppets become “clearly inanimate,” 
and it becomes evident that the 
Narrator is completely alone. The 
performative aspect of the puppets is 
an interesting technique, as it helps 
the audience differentiate between 
the 
performative 
heterosexuality 

the Narrator finds himself forced to 

practice and the reality of his sexual 
identity. The distinction between 
meaningless 
statements 
about 

tolerance and the harsh reality of 
ostracization makes itself visible in a 
way that’s hard to watch. 

“God loves you, just not as you are” 

is a mantra that is intensely hurtful, 
but terribly familiar to many who 
grew up Christian. It’s the mantra 
that drove me away from religion 
altogether. It’s the reason I wake up 
in a cold sweat, terrified of a God I’ve 
tried my best to renounce. “Jesus 
Corner” hits particularly close to 
home because it speaks to not just 
my fears, but the fears of anyone 
who has dared to exist outside of 
the straightlaced (no pun intended) 
Christian ideal.

Perhaps the most powerful motif 

in this show is that of crucifixion. 
Each time the Narrator deviates 

from his performance of “good 
Christian heterosexuality,” we hear 
the scintillating clang of a hammer 
on nails. This cacophony serves as 
the soundtrack for the Narrator’s 
final breakdown, in which he states, 
“Sometimes all you can do is make 
some noise and let God know how 
you feel.” We are left with the final 
image of the Narrator with his 
wrists outstretched, stained with red 
marker, offering himself up as a final 
atonement.

Even in its COVID-19-altered 

form, 
“Jesus 
Corner” 
astounds. 

The oscillation between anguish 
and erraticism on Westphal’s part 
is excellently portrayed, and the 
design concept is simple yet effective. 
Aupperlee’s script mixes the bizarre 
with the biting. It hammers at the 
gruesome reality of homophobia, and 
the nails run deep.

I am a deeply impatient person. I 

try to keep the worst of it subdued, to 
at least play at maturity, but it comes 
out in the way I love spoilers (more 
often than not I seek them out myself) 
and the way I watch the clock tick 
up by seconds during the last minute 
before my shift is over at work and the 
way I average 87 miles per hour on 
the expressway so that I can get to my 
destinations sooner.

Because I’m impatient, I always 

want to skip ahead. If a plot point in 
a movie is taking too long to develop, 
I’ll open the Wikipedia page and read 
what happens before the movie can 
tell me itself. I did it just last week, 
watching the Bride struggle to get out 
of a coffin in “Kill Bill Vol. 2.” I’m not 
sure when it started, but I think it goes 
back a ways. I tell people I just don’t 
like surprises, but what I mean is that 
I don’t like to wait.

I was a sophomore in high school 

the first time I saw the film “Her.” 
At the time, no one had written a 
comprehensive Wikipedia synopsis 
for it yet, so I was forced to let myself 
be surprised. Over the course of the 

film, Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix, 
“Joker”), a lonely writer going through 
a divorce, and Samantha (Scarlett 
Johansson, “Marriage Story”), his 
ultra-intuitive, all-knowing operating 
system who speaks to him through 
an earpiece, form an emotional and 
sexual relationship. He’s a human, 
and she’s a computer program. The 
premise works better in its execution 
than it does on paper (I swear), and 
upon first viewing, I found myself 
wanting to reach for my phone and 
look for a review, a blog post, anything 
that might answer all of the questions 
I had about this movie.

By now, I know all of the answers. 

I love the movie so much that 
Samantha’s lines about how “the 
heart’s not like a box that gets filled up; 
it expands in size the more you love” 
have practically written themselves 
in my DNA. Even before quarantine, 
the film was a comfort I returned to 
often. During quarantine, it resonates 
because it’s about connection and 
disconnection with technology as a 
medium — the ways we can relate 
to each other through it but also the 
ways it limits our interactions. It’s 
easy to identify with Theodore and 
his desire for love and closeness in any 
world, with or without a pandemic, 

but his relationship with someone 
he can’t touch — someone he can’t 
even communicate with without the 
technology — hits harder now than it 
did before.

But the more I watch the movie, 

the more I think that I identify most 
with Isabella (Soko, “The Dancer”), 
a woman who Samantha enlists to 
act as a middleman, to be the body 
Samantha can never have and give 
Theodore what she thinks will be 
more genuine experience during sex. 

Samantha is quick to clarify 

that Isabella is not a sex worker 
because there’s no money involved; 
she just wants to be a part of their 
relationship. Isabella is a conduit, but 
she also comes into their relationship 
with the assumption that she’ll be 
an equal partner. When she enters 
Theodore’s apartment, her arms wrap 
around him immediately, borrowing 
Samantha’s 
emotional 
familiarity 

with him and translating it into the 
physical, even as Samantha guides 
them. It’s Samantha’s voice in their 
ears, but it’s Isabella who has the 
bodily agency. She doesn’t really know 
either of them, but she’s able to act as 
she does, and she might even believe 
she does. When things inevitably go 
awry and Isabella leaves sadly, she 

tells Theodore and Samantha that she 
will always love them. Even though 
he’s the one to call the whole thing 
off and send Isabella home, insisting 
that it just didn’t feel right, I think 
Theodore is more like Isabella than he 
realizes. 

Theodore works for the fictional 

beautifulhandwrittenletters.com, 
a 

company that writes personal letters 
for other people. In one scene, he tells 
Samantha about writing love letters 
for a couple named Roger and Rachel 
for eight years and how he included 
a detail about Rachel’s crooked tooth 
in a letter because he saw it in a photo 
of them. Theodore, like Isabella, is an 
intermediary in other people’s love 
lives, a guest meant to manufacture 
or facilitate intimacy when his hosts 
can’t find or make it themselves. His 
familiarity with them is artificial, but 
he pretends to know them deeply in 
order to replicate their love back to 
them.

There’s something there that I 

can understand. It’s not so much the 
in-betweenness or the way other 
people use Theodore and Isabella to 
communicate love when they can’t 
do it themselves; it’s the immediacy of 
knowing another person. 

When I meet people, sometimes 

I want us to act as we’ve always 
known each other. I’m impatient. I 
want to skip over the pleasantries, the 
hesitation, the shyness, so I can get 
straight to the familiarity, the warmth, 
the kinship. Forget the exposition, 
give me everything that comes after. 
Let me know everything about a 
person and let them know everything 
about me in the second I see them, so 
I can love and be loved in an instant. 
I’m impatient. Drop me somewhere 
near the center of a relationship, past 
the earliest stages but far from the 
end. Let me walk into an apartment 
and wrap my arms around someone I 
didn’t know at all yesterday but know 
deeply today. Make me like Isabella 
and Theodore, but remove the artifice.

I know it’s a lot to ask, and I know 

people just don’t work that way. The 
practical parts of me rail against 
my inability to let go of this kind of 
idealism, the same idealism that 
makes the idea of love at first sight 
so appealing to kids and hopeless 
romantics. It’s the practical parts that 
keep me from leaning completely 
into my fantasies of seeing and then 
immediately knowing other people, of 
cutting through the politeness to get 
to the closeness. I play at maturity by 
holding myself in one spot and trying 
to root myself there.

I’m trying to get myself to enjoy 

the exposition. I’m trying to rein in 
my eagerness and remind myself that, 
sometimes, good things take time. 
I’ll probably keep spoiling movies for 
myself, though. I’m still impatient.

Oh, what a joy — to sit down in a cafe 

and embrace the ambience. Filled with an 
assortment of chairs, knickknacks and eccentric 
personas, sitting down in a cafe for a poetry 
reading is probably in my top 50 things to do if 
you like to read and have a coffee addiction. So 
that’s why I was so excited to drop in on Café 
Shapiro’s first night of student readings, tuning 
in a little differently than how I imagined, with 
my computer on my lap and a bag of Takis by my 
side. Nevertheless, the night had some amazing 
talent that made my hair stand on end and my 
eyes tear up just a little bit, even if it was only 
Takis dust in my eye.

Café Shapiro is a 20-plus year tradition 

created and hosted by the University of 
Michigan’s Library that originally was a student 
coffee break as a part of the University’s “Year 
of the Humanities and Arts.” For two weeks, 
University undergraduate writers read aloud 
selected works, ranging from poems to op-eds. 
Although the first installments have come and 
gone, there are still several more chances to see 
student writers read their work.

One of the first highlights of the first night was 

LSA sophomore Nicole Tooley. Tooley’s poetry 
was the perfect balance of natural and processed 
sugar. Her poem “Those Divine Cows” captured 
childhood in all of its pinky swearing, Kool-Aid 
drinking and cow dung-smoking glory. Maybe 
cow dung isn’t the first thing that comes to mind 
when you think about childhood nostalgia, but 
this story resurfaced a really niche memory for 
me of those field trips you take to that one lonely 
farm or petting zoo off the highway (we all know 
the one). Tooley’s use of childhood imagery and 
sweet, soft cadence created an airy story of 

youth. She captured the sappy love and distilled 
it into a syrupy poem that stopped my heart in its 
viscous nostalgia.

Next on my list of favorite pieces from 

the 
night: 
LSA 
senior 
Dylan 
Gilbert’s 

“Appointment.” It was a chilling poem, focused 
and clear. Gilbert’s poem consisted of a dialogue 
between a patient with saltwater in their 
lungs and a doctor who thinks anything but. 
The juxtaposition of such an obvious ailment 
makes the doctor’s unwillingness to hear the 
patient that much more upsetting. Gilbert was 
able to use this dialogue to address the blatant 
disrespect that Black women face when seeking 
help from America’s healthcare system. Gilbert’s 
voice is clear, and while other readers often felt 
disengaged in their readings, Gilbert brought 
the scene to life with her stunning performance.

Another standout writer from the night was 

LSA junior Malin Andersson with “The Night 
Farmer.” Speaking as someone who definitely 
had a curiosity for astronomy as a kid and still 
does today, a poem about a farmer keeping a 
field of stars sounds like the perfect Pisces, 
sun-inspired Studio Ghibli film. However, 
Andersson’s juxtaposition of the farmer’s 
sparkling cosmic light and the artificial sterility 
of hospital lights provided a somber note to the 
poem’s otherwise whimsical style. Ultimately, 
Andersson’s work felt like the kind of poetry you 
read on a happy rainy day — joyous, with notes 
of melancholy.

All the writers brought an amazing 

assortment of original work to the cafe, and it 
was an absolute pleasure to listen in on some 
of the University’s best writers. Though the 
reading was without the more cringy staples 
of a coffee shop’s poetry night, I was better off 
getting to see students in their homes and in 
their element, with me sitting cozily in mine.

7-Opinion

I 

almost drowned at a birthday 

party when I was five years old. 

Upon arrival at Water Country, 

New England’s “safest and friendliest” 

waterpark, I had raced into a crowded pool 

of seemingly-still water. Little did I know, 

this was the Wave Pool: a 700,000-gallon 

tank of water that mimicked the nearby 

Atlantic ocean.

The 
wave-generating 
machine 

operated on a timer, thus creating 

waves that rapidly increased in size. I 

progressively struggled to keep my head 

above water. Each time I would return to 

the surface, gasping for breath, another 

monstrous wave would topple me over.

Underwater, I managed to cling 

onto something — swimming trunks. 

In an attempt to stay afloat, I pulled on 

them, hard. So hard that they fully came 

off of their occupant. But my efforts to 

surmount the wave tank were to no 

avail.

Five 
minutes 
later, 
I 
was 

unconscious, submerged at the bottom 

of the pool. There was a seemingly-

excessive number of guards on duty 

— over a dozen of them — perched in 

gleaming red chairs that lined the tank’s 

perimeter as if they were spectators in 

an amphitheater. Yet not a single guard 

noticed until a swimmer found me, 

horrified, and called for help.

The next thing I knew, I was reclined 

in a poolside lounge chair, breathing 

through an oxygen mask and flanked by 

paramedics and concerned swimmers. 

When I came to, the large audience that 

had gathered anxiously stood up and 

applauded.

I was fine. Everything was fine.

Being diagnosed with attention

deficit hyperactivity disorder at 20 

years old was cathartic; everything 

finally made sense. But I couldn’t stop 

thinking of that day at the water park, 

and I grew angry. Just as I had displayed 

signs of being a distressed swimmer, my 

ADHD symptoms had clearly presented 

themselves throughout my childhood. 

In both cases, the people who were 

supposed to protect me had failed to do 

so. I had slipped through the cracks.

My memories of ADHD symptoms 

trace back to early elementary school. 

With time these symptoms worsened, 

but my teachers reinforced that I was 

simply “ditzy” or that it was “just my 

personality.” When I communicated 

my symptoms to my doctors, they 

reassured me not to worry; it was “just” 

my anxiety disorder. I had mentioned 

my suspicions of ADHD to my therapist, 

who would laugh and respond, “Marina, 

if you had something, you would’ve 

been diagnosed in kindergarten.”

In reality, girls with ADHD are 

underdiagnosed and undertreated for 

numerous reasons, including gender 

bias in research. According to the 

American Psychological Association, 

girls with undiagnosed ADHD will 

“most likely carry their problems 

into their adulthood, and if it is left 

untreated, their lives often fall apart.” 

I initially felt that my healthcare 

professionals had wronged me. Part of me 

felt grateful, though; my missed diagnosis 

had only decreased my quality of life — it 

was not life-threatening or fatal.

Nonetheless, diagnostic errors are 

often fatal and are not discussed enough. 

While policy change and structural 

reform are necessary, patients can gain 

more autonomy in their health outcomes 

by making changes in how they interact 

with their providers.

Diagnostic errors include diagnoses 

that are initially “missed, wrong, or 

delayed.” John Hopkins researchers 

found that diagnostic errors represented 

the “largest fraction of (malpractice) 

claims, the most severe patient harm, 

and the highest total of penalty payouts.” 

In the United States, 12 million people 

face medical diagnostic errors every year, 

and it’s estimated that 40,000 to 80,000 

of these people die due to complications 

of misdiagnoses. Despite the prevalence 

of these mistakes, diagnostic errors are 

understudied. 

They are frequently “underreported 

or poorly reported” as oftentimes 

patients don’t self-report errors — experts 

downplay the full extent of them and 

most hospitals don’t even track diagnostic 

errors. The rate of errors to “accurate” 

diagnoses is estimated to be about 5%, 

implying that these errors affect at least 

1 in 20 U.S. adults, while other research 

estimates that “10-20% of all diagnoses 

are inaccurate” in the U.S.

Furthermore, 
this 
rate 
of 

diagnostic error may be much higher 

for certain populations. Numerous 

existing disparities in diagnosis are 

thought to particularly concern race/

ethnicity, age and sex. A high rate 

of patients who have experienced 

diagnostic error reported perceiving 

the visible factors of being African 

American, female and a young adult 

as a contributing variable to their 

diagnostic error for even the most 

serious cases, such as strokes or heart 

attacks. The maternal mortality rate, 

which is disproportionately higher for 

Black, American Indian and Alaska 

Native women and increases with age, 

has also been associated with missed 

or delayed diagnosis.

How can we learn to trust our 

providers, our hospitals and the health 

care system as a whole? According 

to the National Academy of Medicine, 

systemic racism and institutional bias 

have been shown to “(manifest) in lower-

quality healthcare.” Additionally, the 

U.S. has an extensive history of medical 

racism and malpractice exploiting Black 

Americans, Native Americans and Puerto 

Ricans, so it is understandable that 

minorities tend to have higher levels of 

physician distrust. 

There has been an increase in interest 

and understanding in the complexity of 

diagnostic error over the past few years, 

and the ECRI Institute has even labeled 

it as “the #1 patient safety problem 

in healthcare today.” The Society to 

Improve Diagnosis in Medicine and 

over 60 other health care organizations 

are collaborating to reduce both health 

disparities and diagnostic error. But 

individuals, 
especially 
members 
of 

communities that have been historically 

abused through medicine, may reasonably 

remain skeptical of their health care 

providers and feel powerless to the health 

care system.

As patients, we are often instructed to 

be “consumers” of medicine, but no one 

ever seems to tell us what that means. Self-

advocacy is the key to gaining agency in 

your diagnosis and health care treatment, 

and here is what that looks like.

Use differential diagnosis to confirm 

your diagnosis: Think like a detective, 

eliminating clues to reach a conclusion. 

When you receive a diagnosis, ask your 

doctor for their steps in reaching the 

diagnosis. Ask for all of the possible 

diagnoses that your doctor considered 

and why each one was eliminated. In this 

process, you could realize that a potential 

diagnosis was falsely eliminated.

Don’t be afraid to take notes. Write 

down the names of the rejected diagnoses 

and any other information you find 

important. In case you later suspect a 

misdiagnosis, you’ll have a backup plan.

Prepare for your appointments like 

you would for an exam. Come with an 

idea of your expectations, any boundaries 

you want to have and questions. You have 

the right to decide what your treatment 

plan is. If you’re not comfortable with a 

proposed plan, ask for more information 

or other options.

Ultimately, trust yourself and your 

body. If something doesn’t feel right, 

vocalize it to your provider or someone 

who you trust that will help you take the 

next steps. Additionally, don’t be afraid 

to get a second opinion. You deserve to 

feel respected and comfortable with your 

provider. Sometimes it takes many tries to 

find the right person. 

While 
you 
probably 
cannot 

singlehandedly resolve the “diagnosis 

crisis,” you can learn how to consume 

health care to your advantage. The cracks 

in the system may be, in reality, gaping 

holes, waiting for an unlucky soul to 

stumble upon one of them. You might find 

these cracks in waterpark wave pools, in 

doctors’ offices and other places where 

you least expect them to arise. And once 

you learn how to navigate these spaces, 

you might gradually rebuild your trust 

in them. Medicine is one of humanity’s 

most important creations, so it must be 

equitable and accessible to all.

N

ames 
have 
power. 
They 

can 
both 
recognize 
and 

infuriate a person. Take the 

case of legendary Indiana University 

basketball coach Bob Knight. He was 

under a zero-tolerance policy after 

multiple disciplinary issues in 2000. 

Then in September 2000, a student 

reportedly referred to him as “Knight,” 

not his preferred “Coach Knight” or 

“Mr. Knight.” That minor detail sparked 

a confrontation that ended up being the 

straw that broke the camel’s back: Coach 

Knight had to leave.

The power of names, however, goes 

far beyond just a single person. We just 

had to search for a more lasting tribute 

for truly exceptional personalities, and 

we found one — naming monuments 

and places after people. What better way 

to permanently etch their names and 

legacies into history, right? Whether we 

should name anything after a person is 

a futile discussion. We’re long past any 

reasonable point of return on that subject.

As soon as we added value to naming 

places after people, everyone started 

queuing up for a piece of the pie. With 

politicians, comedians and well-off 

college alumni, you have diverse pools 

of people willing to pay to get their 

name memorialized. Meanwhile, other 

groups have another motive for jumping 

into the name game — control. The 

Lost Cause of the Confederacy, which 

attempts to falsely portray the racist 

actions of the Confederates as a noble 

effort in defense of states’ rights against 

Northern aggression, did precisely that. 

They erected multiple statues and fought 

aggressively to rename places after 

Confederate figures to control history 

and intimidate those who would oppose 

them. This occurred in earnest around 

World War I, with military bases named 

after Confederate figures along with a 

flurry of statues, novels and plays meant 

to perpetuate these false ideas.

This situation leaves us with a mixed 

bag of personalities among those who 

share this originally exclusive honor of 

receiving a monument in your namesake. 

Quite a few of them end up being 

unsavory characters; maybe a name 

has colonial or oppressive origins. The 

obvious step is to rename. For example, it 

is ridiculous to have military bases named 

after Confederate generals that fought 

against the nation. However, there’s one 

issue that we run into quite quickly — 

emotional attachment. 

Why does this happen? While we’re 

usually adept at recognizing the flaws in 

the people around us, we develop blind 

spots when it comes to our idols. We deify 

some personalities, deeming them heroes 

capable of no wrong. That is setting 

ourselves up for failure. When faced 

with the inevitable flaws in a hero, we 

have two choices: accept them and grow 

disillusioned or cling ever tighter to their 

mythical image.

Hence, we see opposition to renaming 

efforts, even in the case of military bases. 

There can be justifiable criticism towards 

the right for naming military bases 

after Confederates using ill-formulated, 

emotional arguments. At the same time, 

renaming in itself indicates a diminishing 

of one’s honor — removing someone’s 

name indicates that they don’t deserve 

to be honored or remembered. Here 

is where those who’d like to remove 

memorializations of controversial figures 

wrongly assume that all cases should 

be as cut-and-dry as the Confederate 

name case. Renaming can cause massive 

division and confusion, as evidenced by 

the San Francisco school renaming fiasco.

Before delving into the school 

renaming proposals, let’s explore our 

perception of Mohandas Karamchand 

Gandhi, better known as Mahatma 

Gandhi. Maybe the mention of Gandhi 

reminds you of Ben Kingsley’s portrayal 

with iconic quotes like, “An eye for an 

eye will make the whole world blind.” 

(Incidentally, this quote is misattributed 

to Gandhi.) Or perhaps you think of his 

inspiring impact on leaders like Martin 

Luther King, Jr. to pursue non-violent 

protests. 

As a person of Indian origin, Gandhi 

holds mythical status as a hero of the 

Indian independence movement and a 

source of pride. However, Gandhi is also a 

man who espoused racist stereotypes and 

supported segregation during his time in 

South Africa, participated in a twisted 

celibacy test by sleeping with naked 

women about 60 years younger than him 

and treated his wife Kasturba dreadfully. 

He has a complicated legacy that isn’t 

reflected in his public image. One might 

contend that he shouldn’t be celebrated 

and honored, but that is perhaps an 

oversimplified view.

T

ake a short walk across the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

campus and you will see no 

shortage of Canada Goose jackets, 

Hermès bracelets or Gucci sneakers. 

These aren’t objects that the average 

college student — let alone the average 

adult in the United States — can easily 

afford, but based on our campus, you’d 

think they were. Wearing designer 

clothes isn’t an issue in and of itself, but 

it does become an issue when it is the 

result of unchecked privilege. Mar. 12, 

2021, will mark two years since the news 

broke of “Operation Varsity Blues” — the 

infamous college admissions scandal 

which brought to light the lengths 

America’s elite will go to ensure their kids 

get into the country’s most prestigious 

universities. It galvanized the public 

and sent shock waves through college 

campuses across the country. To this day, 

scrolling through social media comments 

of those involved will show you people 

are still upset. While the anger and 

frustration toward the guilty are valid 

and understandable, years later we have 

still failed to recognize that the problem 

is so much more than cheating your way 

into college. 

While attending the University of 

Michigan, where 66% of students come 

from households in the top 20% of the 

income distribution, I have witnessed 

first-hand how deep elitism runs on 

college campuses. It’s easy to point our 

fingers at those who cheated their way 

into elite universities and call out their 

moral failure. It is a lot more difficult to 

call out the systems of privilege that get 

under-qualified students into colleges, 

even when they don’t pose as a star athlete 

or pay someone to take the ACT for them. 

Students who grow up in higher-income 

households live in their own world of 

privilege that gives them all the resources 

they need to not only get into top colleges 

but then rack up achievements not 

accessible to those in lower family income 

brackets. 

What the media failed to recognize 

in the whole college admissions scandal 

was that the college admissions process 

is based on much more than just grades. 

Even if grades and test scores were the 

only criteria, students coming from 

high-earning households have access to 

resources such as tutors and fancy pre-

college programs that aren’t available to 

low-income students. Those resources 

can help increase test scores and fluff-up 

applications. Extracurriculars, school 

prestige and legacy status all factor into 

admissions as well. 

As for extracurriculars, attending 

private or better-funded public schools 

gives students more opportunities to 

participate in prestigious clubs — such 

as the debate team or Model UN — or 

in sports — like crew and fencing — that 

aren’t offered at less well-off schools. 

Even outside of school, families that can 

afford to pay for private piano lessons 

or sailing lessons help ensure their kids 

stand out to college recruiters. 

A student’s ties to a university are a 

big contributor to getting rich kids into 

schools that they otherwise wouldn’t be 

able to. In recent years, legacy students 

— those who have a family member that 

attended the university they are applying 

to — have been disturbingly more likely 

than the average applicant to get into 

top schools. At universities like Harvard 

and Princeton, legacy students are four 

to five times more likely to get admitted 

than those who don’t have family ties to 

the school. Of course, a “philanthropic” 

donation to a university before your child 

applies could easily do the trick as well.

Students who don’t have to worry 

about the cost of tuition also have a 

powerful 
thing 
that 
lower-income 

students don’t have: options. To be able 

to choose where you’ll spend four years 

of your life and to handpick a school that 

is the perfect match is a privilege that is 

often overlooked. For many low-income 

students, just being able to attend college, 

whether it be a community college or a 

state school, is a blessing. We often forget 

how inaccessible college education has 

become for so many students. Nearly 

70% of 2019 graduates had to take out 

student loans. This barrier to entry, 

exemplified by the staggering difference 

in matriculation rates among students 

from high-income families and low-

income families, is something you don’t 

hear well-off students complaining about. 

The college admissions scandal 

shouldn’t only have taught us about how 

unjust the college admissions process is. 

The way students spend time outside of 

class in college are vastly different and 

are often perpetrated by family income. 

While some students are getting initiated 

into elite secret societies on campus or 

spending spring break partying on the 

yacht of a chairman for their school’s 

board of trustees, lower-income students 

are often working low-paying jobs just 

to make rent for the month. If you’re 

fortunate enough to have your family 

cover your tuition and living expenses, 

the opportunities available to you 

drastically increase, whether they be fun 

extracurriculars or unpaid internships. 

Prestigious universities that gate-

keep lower-income students create an 

environment that allows many rich 

students to be blind to their privilege. 

The University of Michigan is all too 

familiar with this issue. It has been widely 

criticized for its lack of socioeconomic 

diversity. It’s apparent from campus that 

the University is not your average state 

school. I will never forget a conversation 

between two students I overheard during 

my first week on campus. One student 

complained about not knowing how to 

do her own laundry because her maid 

had always done it for her. Her conclusion 

was to hire a maid service at school 

because she simply couldn’t be bothered 

to do her own chores. The other student 

complained about her father not booking 

her a first-class seat for her flight home 

for Thanksgiving. I was shocked. Though 

those may be normal conversations on 

campus, they are problems most people 

could only wish to have. The worst part 

was how oblivious the students were of 

their privilege. 

The elitism of students at the 

University of Michigan and at so 

many other top universities is perhaps 

more apparent than ever. The college 

admissions 
scandal 
brought 
the 

conversation of elitism among students 

from high-earning families to the 

national stage. However, the conversation 

didn’t go far enough. There is much more 

progress that can be made in identifying 

the systems that allow students from 

high-income families to get ahead. It 

starts with admissions counselors and 

university administrators making a 

concerted effort to place equal value 

on prospective students despite their 

socioeconomic status. 

What the college admissions scandal 

didn’t teach us about privilege

I slipped through the cracks in the health care system. You could too.

What’s in a name?

W

hen I first started watching 

the 2017 Netflix original 

series “Girlboss” a few years 

ago, I fell in love with Sofia Marlowe’s 

entrepreneurial spirit and fearless way 

of living. Despite discouragement from 

her father, a man at a consignment shop 

and seemingly everyone else on her 

path, Sophia successfully launches her 

own business, Nasty Gal, an online retail 

store which upcycles and resells old 

clothes. Against the odds, she believes in 

herself, stays true to her vision and never 

compromises her style because of others’ 

judgements.

When I reached the end of the 

first season and discovered the show 

had been canceled, I was dismayed. I 

had discovered a new role model who 

inspired me during a time when I felt 

so much pressure and competition from 

academia. I was disappointed in Netflix 

and its viewers for not seeing more value 

in a show with such a uniquely strong 

female lead. Sophia Marlowe’s fictional 

story, based on company founder Sophia 

Amoruso’s path to founding Nasty 

Gal, is exactly what the business world 

needs more of: inspiring tales of unlikely 

leaders pursuing their dreams.

On one hand, being a girl or woman in 

entrepreneurship is amazing. In a world 

that is always telling you what to wear, 

how to do your makeup and how to act in 

the presence of men, entrepreneurship 

provides a unique space to make your 

own decisions. It’s one of the few places 

where women can be free to define for 

themselves how to do business. With that 

said, being a woman in entrepreneurship 

also comes with unique challenges.

When women do find the courage to 

follow our dreams, we face both external 

and internal sexism. And while the 

experience differs for everyone based 

on their identity, it’s something that no 

woman should have to deal with. 

Liisbeth, 
an 
“indie, 
feminist 

‘zine 
about 
post-capitalist 

entrepreneurship,” 
published 
an 

article in 2019 called, “Gaslighting: 

The Silent Killer of Women’s Startups.” 

Gaslighting, as described by The 

Guardian, is a form of “psychological 

manipulation intended to make the 

victim question their sanity.” The term 

was coined from Patrick Hamilton’s 

1938 
play, 
“Gaslight,” 
in 
which 

the husband, Jack Manningham, 

convinces his wife Bella that she is 

going mad by secretly turning the 

lights on and off in the house. The 

idea is that if you think you’re going 

mad, you’re more likely to trust the 

manipulator’s judgment calls more 

than your own. In entrepreneurship, 

this can look like seemingly innocuous 

phrases such as, “Are you sure that 

actually happened?” and “It was just a 

joke,” according to Liisbeth.

Although gaslighting is an issue both 

in personal relationships and in the 

workplace, I would argue that an equally 

measurable problem is internalized 

misogyny. How often do we think 

subconsciously to ourselves, “Because I 

am a woman, I need permission from a 

man to have an original idea?” 

Even at the University of Michigan, 

women are undervalued in the hiring 

process. In the undergraduate Center 

for Entrepreneurship, women represent 

just 26% of the faculty. Only 42% of 

American businesses are run by women. 

While hiring more women to hold these 

positions is absolutely necessary, these 

roles are not going to change overnight. 

To quote Sophia Amoruso, “You don’t 

get taken seriously by asking someone to 

take you seriously. You’ve got to show up 

and own it. If this is a man’s world, who 

cares? I’m still really glad to be a girl in 

it.”

At least part of the challenge of 

the modern woman entrepreneur is 

to pursue her own ambitions without 

regard to others’ judgments –– to create 

for herself, not for the critics. By focusing 

on her own empowerment while 

understanding how sexism is ingrained 

in the culture, she gives herself a more 

immediate chance of achieving her 

goals. While men must be held to higher 

standards, at this point, we can’t count 

on them.

Going into International Women’s 

Month, what I want women and girls to 

know is that you don’t need permission 

from anybody to follow your dreams. 

Your ideas are brilliant and there are 

people who will support you, even if 

there are times along the way when you 

are the only one who believes in your 

vision.

Sexism in entrepreneurship


F

or anyone who, like me, is obsessed 

with the British royal family, the 

CBS broadcast of Oprah Winfrey’s 

interview with Meghan Markle and 

Prince Harry on Sunday night was merely 

another episode in the Netflix series “The 

Crown.” However, the interview had a 

subtlety that transforms the royal family’s 

drama into an experience that is relatable 

to many Americans: a dysfunctional 

family. 

In an attempt to create common ground 

following World War II, the monarchy 

shifted its cultural focus toward children 

and families. Consequently, when Prince 

Charles was born in 1948, Queen Elizabeth 

and Prince Phillip were portrayed as 

models for how a contemporary family 

should function. In every perceivable way, 

they were a young, powerful and flawless 

family. Seeing the opportunity, the British 

government used Queen Elizabeth and 

her family to promote the idea that family 

connects the British people to one another. 

For the family emphasis to follow, 

the royal family was made into the 

archetype for all British families to 

strive for. Significant events such as 

Queen Elizabeth’s coronation in 1953 

intentionally centered on family. Being the 

first televised coronation, over 27 million 

British people watched the ceremony, 

which included shots of Prince Charles 

and Princess Anne. British children were 

given commemorative coronation mugs 

to ensure every family felt personally 

included in the celebration.

However, in the decades that have 

followed, the public has become aware 

of various fractures and scandals within 

the royal family, with none being more 

infamous than the clash between Princess 

Diana and Prince Charles. Their messy 

divorce further damaged the facade of 

the happy family when public opinion 

of the royal family was at a low due to 

accusations of numerous marital affairs 

and extravagant lifestyles. The tell-

all book “Diana: Her True Story” and 

several television interviews described 

the inevitable collapse of the Prince and 

Princess of Wales’ marriage and how her 

cries for help with her mental health were 

ignored. BBC documentaries were no 

longer enough to fill the cracks that had 

appeared in the world’s most iconic family. 

But in its own unique way, the royal family 

has modernized with the rest of the world. 

During the two-hour special, Meghan 

and Harry revealed a heavily flawed 

family, which stands in stark contrast to 

the image of the royal family projected 

during the 1950s. Altogether, the lack of 

support and understanding from the rest 

of the royal family — in regards to Meghan 

and Harry’s requests for assistance 

with their mental health and security — 

demonstrates a clear example of a divided 

family. 

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s 

decision to speak publicly about their 

situation does a lot more than just expose 

the royal family’s internal affairs. More 

importantly, their interview testifies 

to the importance of discussing your 

own family dynamics. In many ways, 

Markle’s experience parallels that of 

Princess Diana. Both were brought into 

the family that treated them unfairly, 

which led them to speak out and call 

attention to the circumstances they 

struggled with. By doing so, Meghan 

and Diana demonstrated the importance 

of holding the monarchy accountable 

for their actions, regardless of familial 

relationships.

In America, family life has changed 

dramatically, 
with 
an 
increasing 

number of children from single-parent 

households and families becoming 

smaller overall. Due to these shifts, a 

dominant family form no longer exists in 

America as it did in the 1960s. Research 

shows that the structure of modern 

families can be tied to the existence of 

dysfunctional families. While not all 

single-parent or blended families are 

dysfunctional, they are less likely to have 

“standard” relationships due to outside 

factors, including social environment 

and inability to provide adequate 

childcare.

Dysfunction within a family setting 

can take multiple forms, including mental 

and physical abuse, yet many children 

are unaware their family environment is 

not considered standard. Unfortunately, 

these 
conditions 
have 
long-lasting 

effects on children, including low self-

esteem, absence of identity and difficulty 

cultivating relationships. Furthermore, 

children from dysfunctional families 

regularly justify their parent’s actions and 

are never taught signs of unhealthy family 

dynamics because this is rarely discussed. 

In the United States, there remains a 

preference for households of two parents 

in their first marriage with multiple 

children. Yet, as divorce and single 

parenting have become more socially 

acceptable, the typical suburban family 

with a white picket fence is no longer a 

realistic model. Consequently, neither is a 

family that gets along perfectly with one 

another. 

By revealing the undercurrents of 

the royal family, Meghan Markle and 

Prince Harry’s interview has helped 

normalize the discussion of family 

dynamics — whether good or bad. For 

too long, people have hidden away 

their experiences with their family 

by adhering to the cliché that blood 

is thicker than water. Openly talking 

about family, regardless of structure or 

dynamic, should be more common and 

acceptable. Continuing the belief that 

the only respectable household form is 

one dating back to the post-World War II 

era is outdated and harmful for children. 

Having more frequent and open 

conversations 
allows 
children 
and 

teenagers to learn acceptable treatment 

from 
family 
members. 
Moreover, 

discussions about the reality of family 

erode the social stigma of being raised 

in an imperfect family. Hearing people 

around you only talk about the good parts 

of their family creates a false sense of the 

lives others live — which can be further 

augmented if one has to return to a home 

that seems the opposite. The family 

experience you portray to your friends 

and peers should be representative of your 

reality, not merely what you believe the 

rest of society wants to hear.

A

fter Sens. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., 
and 
Raphael 
Warnock, 

D-Ga., won their Georgia 

runoff races in early January and 
gave Democrats a slim majority in the 
Senate, advocates of raising the federal 
minimum wage saw an opportunity 
to finally pass a wage hike. However, 
those hopes were quickly dashed 
when the Senate voted 58-42 against 
a proposal sponsored by Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, I-Vt., to increase the wage to 
$15 an hour.

This vote not only deals a major blow 

to those rallying behind a minimum 

wage hike, but could also force President 

Joe Biden to make compromises with his 

his promise to raise the minimum wage, 

unless he can influence Republicans 

and moderate Democrats like Sen. Joe 

Manchin, D-W.Va.

Regardless of the Senate’s rejection 

of a $15 minimum wage, it’s obvious 

that a minimum wage increase is 

warranted in certain areas across the 

country. A recent poll conducted by 

Monmouth University finds that 53% of 

Americans support raising the federal 

minimum wage to $15 an hour. The 

minimum wage has been fixed at $7.25 

an hour since 2009, and our country 

has experienced inflation since then. At 

the same time, our problems of wealth 

and income inequality have worsened; 

according to the Pew Research Center, 

the wealthiest Americans are getting 

richer fastest while lower and middle-

income households are falling behind. 

With sky-high costs of living in many 

locations, raising the minimum wage 

would lower poverty levels and seems 

like a common-sense measure.

But while raising the minimum 

wage would be beneficial on a number 

of fronts, there are also issues with 

raising the federal minimum wage 

to $15, as evidenced by the bipartisan 

vote against it in the Senate. One 

of the clearest arguments against a 

minimum wage increase is that it would 

precipitate broad job losses across the 

entire economy. In a recent report, the 

Congressional Budget Office estimated 

that a hike to $15 would slash a total 

of 1.4 million jobs, reducing national 

employment levels by almost 1% due to 

employee layoffs, signifying a notable 

hit to the labor force. As the economy 

begins to recover from the disastrous 

COVID-19 pandemic, a minimum 

wage increase could undermine much-

needed economic growth by forcing 

over a million people out of work.

There are valid arguments for 

raising the wage to $15 or keeping it as 

is, and we should give all viewpoints 

attention. But what is indisputable is 

that select areas of the country would 

benefit from a minimum wage hike of 

some sort. Instead of waiting for our 

representatives and senators to sort out 

their policy differences in Congress — 

something that could take years — each 

state should address its own minimum 

wage.

Handing over responsibility on the 

minimum wage to states makes sense 

on a lot of levels. Individual states 

already have the power to regulate their 

own minimum wages, although there 

currently isn’t a great incentive to do so 

since the federal government is trying to 

control the minimum wage for the entire 

nation. Encouraging states to address 

their own minimum wages would offer 

a major boost to employees around the 

country; workers subject to both federal 

and state rates are “entitled to the higher 

of the two minimum wages,” according 

to Cornell Law School.

While state action doesn’t deliver 

the broad $15 hourly rate that many 

have been fighting for, it gives the 

power to state governments to assess 

their own economies and make their 

own informed decisions. It allows 

states in need of an increase to do 

so; at the same time, it will allow 

states to opt out based on their own 

circumstances. California sets a 

good example for how states should 

use their powers in response to 

the unique conditions within their 

borders; At the beginning of this year, 

the Golden State raised its minimum 

wage to $14 an hour.

One of the best arguments for this 

approach is that the median cost of 

living differs dramatically from state 

to state, as does the current median 

wage. Instead of painting with a 

broad brush, giving authority to each 

state acknowledges these economic 

differences and promotes a stronger, 

more detailed solution. 

For instance, the average cost of 

living in the state of Mississippi is over 

15% lower than the national average. 

By contrast, the state of California, 

notorious for its high cost of living, 

exceeds the national average cost 

of living by almost 50%. Whereas a 

minimum wage hike to $15 may do 

more harm than good in Mississippi 

and similar states due to their low 

costs of living, it would be beneficial in 

the entire state of California, not just a 

select few areas. 

Moreover, the living wage — the 

amount necessary to live a comfortable 

lifestyle — comes out to about $58,000 

per year in Mississippi, compared 

to nearly $100,000 in California. It 

makes sense that workers in these 

two states should make considerably 

different amounts since their costs 

of living are quite different. Why 

should these two states have the same 

minimum wage?

Without a doubt, the current 

minimum wage from 2009 is 

inappropriate for certain parts of 

our country. Particularly for those 

with skyrocketing living costs, 

this glaring problem needs to be 

addressed. But rather than institute 

a national measure, something that 

the Senate has already tried and 

rejected, states should revise their 

own minimum wages in response to 

their unique and evolving needs. In 

the end, delegating the power to each 

state will pave the way for a solution 

that acknowledges our differences 

while supporting America’s workers 

at every turn.

Normalize discussing the reality of family dynamics
Minimum wage hikes should be left to the states

MEERA KUMAR | COLUMNIST

W

henever people ask, “How 

are you?” I reflexively 

respond with, “Good! 

How ‘bout you?” I never take time to think 

about how I’m truly doing. Generally, 

asking someone how they are is simply an 

easy greeting — often, people don’t care 

for a genuine answer. So, we tell everyone, 

including ourselves, that we’re good.

Even though we preface nearly every 

conversation with a “How’s it going?” — 

nobody seems to pay attention to their 

state of being. “Good,” we say. “Fine.” Our 

reflex is to lie without searching for an 

answer.

When I ask how you are, I want your 

honest answer. Really, truly, how are you? 

Because, in all honesty, I’m terribly, totally, 

utterly burnt out.

These days, so are most people I know. 

Every day, when I call my best friend 

Nandini, we describe our plans for the 

rest of the day. Pretty much daily, we 

work from when we rise to when we go 

to sleep. Often 18 hours later, both of us 

accidentally fall asleep on FaceTime calls. 

Nearly every student I’ve spoken to at the 

University of Michigan has mentioned 

their exhaustion with the overwhelming 

workload of online school. The entire 

world seems to be weighed down with 

Zoom fatigue. 

Yet, we continue to chip away at 

our seemingly endless pile of work. We 

convince ourselves that we need to be a 

certain amount of “productive” each day. 

Otherwise, the day is a waste. In our quest 

to simulate a seemingly “normal” virtual 

learning experience, we sacrifice our 

mental health. In our haze, we spend all 

of our time in a single cramped place, lost 

in the small details and unable to see the 

big picture.

Nowadays, our contact with the 

outside world is limited. The only time 

we get asked how we are is when a friend 

or professor asks at the beginning of a 

conversation or class and it can feel nice to 

know that someone cares about us, even 

in the form of a trivial greeting. We search 

high and low for empathy in any location 

we can find. Without even realizing it, I’ve 

relied on others to ask me how I am. 

My friends and I, often concerned for 

each other’s mental health, advise each 

other to take a nap, and go for a walk. 

However, we seldom give the same advice 

to ourselves. Why are we so incapable of 

taking care of ourselves in the way we 

take care of others? 

The noted Australian psychologist 

Godfrey Barrett-Lennard has an answer: 

we lack empathy toward ourselves. 

Due to our emotional involvement with 

our problems, it can be challenging 

to understand what’s really going on. 

Self-empathy, a valuable skill, allows us 

to zoom out and view a situation with 

impartiality. We can figure out how we’re 

doing, and if we’re not doing well, we can 

find necessary solutions. Barrett-Lennard 

says the goal of therapy is to gain more 

empathy for oneself and others.

It would be easy to dismiss this concept 

as part of the recent commercialized, 

extremely-hyped self-care movement. 

However, it’s important to note that self-

empathy and self-compassion are not 

the same things. Self-compassion (which 

is also extremely important) involves 

showing love and kindness to oneself. In 

contrast, self-empathy involves simply 

observing the patterns of emotions we 

experience — it sounds like a no-brainer 

but is actually incredibly hard to maintain. 

Having the skill of self-empathy is 

empowering. Instead of depending on 

others for superficial care to (barely) 

check-in with yourself, you’re able to give 

yourself empathy and solve problems in 

emotionally charged situations. When 

you’re overwhelmed, instead of staring at 

a screen for hours, take a break. 

When you’re tired, instead of forcing 

yourself to work even longer, take a nap. 

In our “hustle-obsessed” culture, forcing 

yourself to struggle is seen as a positive 

concept. But this has extremely harmful 

effects. Instead of ignoring our feelings, 

we should encourage people to be 

conscious of them and deal with complex 

emotions accordingly. 

Commonly cited ways to get in touch 

with oneself include therapy, meditation, 

journaling and more. However, these are 

easier said than done — it’s important to 

remember that taking care of one’s mental 

health can sometimes require active effort. 

It’s necessary to ask yourself: How am I? If 

you’re honest with yourself, there’s a good 

chance you’re doing less than stellar. Think 

about it. Talk it out. Write it down. Leave 

yourself a voice memo on your phone. And 

try not to hate yourself for your negative 

feelings or your perceived inability to do 

work. While figuring out one’s feelings, 

it’s essential to lead with empathy and not 

idealistic expectations.

If you’re burnt out, like most college 

students right now, I implore you to 

take a step back. In fact, I’m currently 

encouraging you to do the bare minimum 

of the work needed to get through the 

week. Skip a class or two if you need to — 

forcing yourself to go to class exhausted 

won’t help your learning. When I mention 

this to friends, they guiltily say, “I would, 

but I’ve already been slacking off this 

week…” — good for you for taking time 

off for yourself! If you’re still stressed, 

I’m begging you to take more time off 

to recharge. To force yourself to be 

productive while burnt-out is unrealistic. 

When we step off the treadmill, 

we feel incredibly guilty. However, it’s 

important to ask yourself: Who is this 

guilt benefitting? (Hint: it doesn’t look like 

the guilt is good for you). Your insecurity 

over how much work you’ve completed 

that day has been perpetuated by 

companies obsessed with “productivity” 

to maximize profit — by creating a culture 

where destroying yourself to please your 

boss feels necessary. We must unlearn 

this mindset. Stop expecting yourself 

to operate at full capacity at all times, 

especially during a pandemic — seriously, 

show yourself some empathy.

In this age, we measure our self-worth 

by how “productive” we were earlier 

in the day. I urge you to rebel and see 

yourself as worth more than a machine 

that cranks out essay after essay. Distance 

yourself from your work — you deserve a 

break.

Preventing the next pandemic

T

hroughout human history, the 

main determinant separating 

humans from other species has 

been our ability to adapt the environment 

to address our needs. Whether harnessing 

fire to stay warm in cold temperatures, 

inventing the wheel to transport things 

long distances or utilizing the earth’s 

magnetic field to guide navigation, 

humans have made advancements that 

make it easier for us to live. But what 

happens when we overstep and go too far? 

Since the 1980s there has been a “steep 

rise in the number of outbreaks globally.” 

A Brown University study found that 

between the years 1980 and 2014, there 

were more than 12,000 infection outbreaks 

affecting 44 million people around the 

world. In order to stop disease outbreaks 

from becoming more and more common, 

human society needs to drastically rethink 

how it interacts with nature. 

One of the forces driving the increasing 

number of infectious outbreaks is how 

land is used. It is estimated that humans 

have changed 75% of all land globally. 

What that looks like depends on the 

region. It could mean urbanization and 

suburban sprawl or deforestation and 

mining, all of which make outbreaks 

more likely. The Centers for Disease 

Control and Prevention estimate that 

three out of every four new diseases begin 

with animals. These are called zoonotic 

diseases — scientists believe there are 

more than 1.7 million undiscovered 

zoonotic viruses, of which roughly half 

are predicted to be able to infect humans. 

Changes to the land bring humans and 

animals closer together. Deforestation and 

other land-use changes are responsible 

for about one-third of new diseases. As 

habitats are destroyed for thousands of 

species, they are forced to migrate into 

new ecosystems, potentially disrupting 

the food chain or being exposed to new 

toxins. Eventually, they come in contact 

with humans, increasing the risk of a 

zoonotic disease outbreak amongst people. 

An example of this is the origins of the 2014 

Ebola outbreak in Guinea. One of the first 

people to contract Ebola was a little boy 

playing under a tree where a large number 

of bats had begun to live. Bats do not like 

living near humans — they had been forced 

out of their homes by forest clearing and 

mining done by foreign companies. 

Urbanization contributes to the spread 

of disease by concentrating 4 billion people 

globally into small areas, sometimes living 

in very unclean conditions. As the world 

becomes increasingly urban and more 

people move to cities, it presents the 

perfect opportunity for diseases to reach 

the level of an outbreak. 

Suburban areas pose a different 

threat to public health. Since the 1970s, 

Lyme disease has affected the Northeast 

United States. Lyme disease is caused 

by ticks feeding on white-footed mice 

where they become infected and then 

transfer the bacteria to humans. When 

people started moving out of cities and the 

suburbs began to expand, formerly forest 

and agricultural land was repurposed. 

This disrupted the ecosystem and 

harmed predators of the white-footed 

mouse, allowing the mice to grow their 

population and thereby increasing the 

frequency of Lyme disease. 

Another contributor to the increase of 

infectious diseases is climate change. Like 

many things, climate change seems to just 

exacerbate existing problems, making 

them more harmful and harder to solve. 

As climate change leads to hotter and 

wetter climates, the spread of infectious 

diseases becomes easier. Infections that 

are transmitted through water, food, 

mosquitos and ticks are transmitted more 

easily in warmer and wetter climates. 

Studies have found that diseases such 

as dengue, malaria and cholera have 

already become more contagious with the 

changing climate. Warmer temperatures 

also are forcing thousands of species to 

migrate from areas they had lived in for 

centuries. The migration of these species 

brings them closer to humans, which 

again contributes to the spread of disease. 

While these changes are scary, the 

good thing is that there are actions 

humans can take. One major step is to 

stop deforestation. This would help keep 

many habitats intact, and in turn prevent 

species from being forced to migrate. 

Additionally, millions of people around the 

world call forests their home. Forests also 

help to reduce carbon in the atmosphere 

— absorbing more carbon than the U.S. 

emits every year — which helps mitigate 

climate change and therefore helps limit 

the spread of infectious diseases. 

Another thing that humans can do 

is to adopt the One Health approach to 

governing. This plan looks at humans, 

animals, plants and their common 

environment holistically. When using 

a lens that assumes we are all part of 

nature, we are all unhealthy when one 

part is unhealthy. By designing policies 

and programs that place the health 

of everything into consideration, it 

will result in a healthier public. This 

approach, comprised of thorough policy 

proposals rooted in research, can be used 

in environmental regulations to ensure 

air and water quality are not making 

anyone sick. 

Urban planning can also use this 

to design cities in a way that will best 

decrease opportunities for diseases to 

spread. Lastly, the One Health approach 

can be used for epidemiology. Unhealthy 

environments can cause asthma or other 

respiratory issues, and sick animals 

have caused Ebola, Lyme disease, Zika 

and plenty of other infectious diseases. 

Looking at public health through a holistic 

lens will allow us to identify and address 

many of the factors that contribute to 

human illness and sickness. 

Something important to mention 

about outbreak prevention is that it 

looks different everywhere. A region’s 

development, population, culture, climate 

and countless other factors will influence 

how people decide to approach fending 

off disease outbreaks. In Thailand, for 

example, this took the form of an app. 

Residents use the app to send pictures of 

any animals or plants that look suspicious 

to public health officials and scientists 

who are then made aware of diseases and 

can research or contain them before they 

become outbreaks. 

Officials estimate that preventing 

the next pandemic will cost around 

$22 billion per year. While this is a 

large amount, it is irresponsible not to 

consider, given that the economic costs of 

COVID-19 are predicted to be upwards 

of $10 trillion. Investing in pandemic 

prevention is not only the smart thing 

to do because it will save lives, but it 

is the economically smart decision 

too. COVID-19 has shown us that we 

must put an emphasis on public health 

and need to be adequately funded and 

address infectious disease prevention. 

We cannot forget that we live within 

nature and are not immune to nature’s 

consequences.

Pertofsky credits her success to her teammates’ support in win over Indiana

Sophomore right-side hitter May 

Pertofsky led the Michigan volley-

ball team (4-3 Big Ten) to a 3-1 win 

over Indiana (3-13) on Saturday with 

17 kills on the day, only one shy of 

her career-best. Junior outside hit-

ter Paige Jones had an outstanding 

match the day before, but Pertofsky 

stepped up in the second game to lead 

the Wolverines when Jones fell back.

“This team does that really well,” 

Michigan coach Mark Rosen said. 

“They just rely on each other, they 

have confidence in each other. They 

trust each other, and so if someone is 

a little off, somebody will step up in 

another way.” 

Pertofsky, however, credits her 

stellar performance to the rest of her 

teammates and the role they all play 

in each other’s performances. 

“The biggest thing is I know my 

team has my back,” Pertofsky said. “I 

could swing as hard as I could and if 

I get blocked, or if they get a touch or 

something like that, I know my team 

is going to be there for me.”

Pertofsky started the day with six 

kills in the first set, helping the Wol-

verines to a 30-28 win. Two aces from 

Pertofsky in both the third and fourth 

sets helped lead the team to win both 

of those games as well. She also hit 

a .593, the second highest for Michi-

gan, behind only junior middle block-

er Kayla Bair. Pertofsky also had an 

impressive performance Friday, rack-

ing up the second-most kills for the 

team with 13, but she was outshined 

by Jones, who had a program-record 

37 kills. Pertofsky’s outing came off of a 

two-week pause for the Wolverines, as 

they were quarantined due to COVID-

19 contact tracing the previous two 

weeks and missed games against Min-

nesota and Rutgers. Despite previously 

playing just seven games, compared to 

Indiana’s 16, Michigan was still able to 

record a pair of wins this weekend. 

“We’ve been hit pretty hard,” Perto-

sky said. “I think we’re one of the three 

schools that has been hit the hardest 

with COVID and restrictions and stuff, 

so that’s definitely sucked a lot, but 

every time we have the opportunity to 

come into the gym, we work as hard as 

we can and we stay connected.”

Although Wolverines have had 

many pauses in their season, they 

place an emphasis on focusing on 

what is controllable. 

“We talk about that in our pro-

gram a lot — don’t worry about or 

don’t get focused on the things we 

have no control over,” Rosen said. “I 

think this team has a lot of potential, 

and we knew that at the beginning 

and we felt that at the beginning, but 

now once we can have some time in 

the gym and some consistent com-

petition, I think we’ll see that. And I 

thought this weekend we kept getting 

better.”

Without Pertofsky’s performance 

and her resiliency, Michigan may 

have taken a step backwards this 

weekend. Instead, it did the opposite.

Puzzling final possession cements Michigan defeat

INDIANAPOLIS — Regardless of the 

result, Juwan Howard was steadfast in his 

plan. Following a 3-pointer from senior 

guard Chaundee Brown, the Michigan 

men’s basketball trailed Ohio State by just a 

single point with 47 seconds left. Assuming 

the Wolverines could get a stop on defense, 

Howard drew up a play in the huddle — a 

berth to Sunday’s Big Ten Tournament final 

resting on the outcome. 

A stop, a score and Michigan would 

complete a double-digit comeback that 

seemed unfathomable just minutes before.

The Buckeyes’ point guard C.J. Walker 

obliged with the former by stepping on his 

own baseline and turning the ball back over 

to the Wolverines with 28 seconds to go. 

Howard, with a timeout remaining and his 

team riding a surge of momentum from the 

last few minutes, let his team go. 

“I did not want to call a timeout, didn’t 

want to let their team get set up,” Howard 

said. “Teams don’t know what you’re gonna 

run when you have the ball in your hands for 

the last possession.”

Michigan started the possession in an 

empty set — spacing the floor on the perimeter 

and giving graduate point guard Mike Smith 

ample space to initiate the final play. As the 

seconds ticked away, it became clear that 

the Wolverines would hold for the final shot. 

With go-to options Isaiah Livers and Franz 

Wagner on the bench — Livers, due to injury 

and Wagner, having fouled out — the ball was 

entirely in Smith’s hands. 

Just eight seconds remained when 

freshman center Hunter Dickinson set a high-

ball screen for Smith. Ohio State switched 

defenders, leaving 6-foot-7 forward Justice 

Sueing on Dickinson and forward E.J. Liddell 

on Smith. Rather than dump it down-low to 

Dickinson, who had scored six of Michigan’s 

last 11 points, Smith kept it and put up a 

stepback 3-pointer over Liddell’s outstretched 

hand. The shot richotected on the back rim 

with virtually no time left for an offensive 

rebound opportunity. The Wolverines had 

lost. 

“We had the play, we had the ball, we had 

the shot, unfortunately we just missed it,” 

Howard said. “But I’ll take that shot any day.”

Added 
Dickinson: 
“Everybody 
was 

confident in it. If we had the opportunity to 

go back, I would not be hesitant at all with 

letting Mike shoot that next one. We were 

all confident in Mike. and I told him after the 

game, I’d let him shoot that one again if he had 

the chance.”

Smith is a proven scorer, having averaged 

22.8 points his last season at Columbia and 

shooting 45.8% from 3-point range this 

season. He also was coming off arguably his 

best game in a Michigan jersey, a double-

double performance against Maryland on 

Friday. And yet, with all that said, one can’t 

help but question the final play. 

Howard and Michigan might have felt 

comfortable with Smith taking the last shot, 

but feeling comfortable about that shot being 

a stepback three seems unlikely — especially 

trailing by just one point. The Buckeyes 

had been unable to deal with Dickinson all 

afternoon. If given the ball on the block, there 

was a high chance he would’ve scored or 

gotten fouled. At least, a better chance than a 

contested 3-point attempt. 

To bleed the clock down to the last possible 

moment leaves no second chance opportunity, 

no margin for error. 

Howard’s belief in his players has been 

well-documented, and one confounding 

possession 
shouldn’t 
necessarily 
be 

extrapolated into something larger, but with 

all that hung in the balance on Saturday 

afternoon, it stung nonetheless.

Down by one in the final posession of Saturday’s game, the Wolverines couldn’t complete their comeback. 

Livers’s presence missed in loss 

to Buckeyes

As the Michigan men’s basketball team 

made its way out onto the court for its 

Big Ten semifinal matchup against Ohio 

State, no player received louder cheers 

than Isaiah Livers. As fans in attendance 

cheered from the stands, the Wolverines’ 

captain extended his hand and waved to 

them before the start of a top-10 matchup.

But Livers wouldn’t be playing.

Just hours before tip-off, Michigan 

revealed that Livers had sustained a stress 

injury in his foot and would remain out 

of the lineup, indefinitely. Outfitted with 

a boot, Livers was forced to watch the 

biggest game of his team’s season from the 

sidelines. 

“It’s not just something that happened 

one day,” Livers said. “A stress fracture is 

an injury that happens over time. It was 

something that I was just battling and we 

were rehabbing.”

When Livers received the news of his 

injury, he felt a whirlwind of emotions. 

Averaging 13.1 points and 6.6 rebounds per 

night, Livers returned to Ann Arbor with a 

vision: winning a national championship. 

Now, it appears that his senior campaign 

may not feature the storybook ending he 

intended.

“I kinda felt like Zavier Simpson and Jon 

Teske, how their season got shortened last 

year around this time,” Livers said. “You 

just hate to see it.”

With so many emotions running 

through his head, there was only one 

person Livers wanted to speak to:

“Juwan Howard, who really helped me 

once I got the news, he was the first person 

I talked to on the phone,” Livers said. “It 

says a lot about his character, he was there 

for me, he understood. It was comforting, 

especially hearing his voice. I had no words. 

But he did all the talking for me, I didn’t 

have to speak.”

As the game tipped off in Indianapolis, 

Livers was replaced in the starting lineup 

by junior forward Brandon Johns Jr. While 

Johns performed admirably in relief, the 

absence of Livers loomed large, especially 

in a first half that saw the Wolverines put 

up just 27 points, a season low.

“Obviously, Isaiah’s a great talent, one 

of the best players in the country and so 

missing him was obviously gonna be a big 

hill that we had to climb over, but I think 

the team did a really good job of next man 

up,” freshman center Hunter Dickinson 

said.

While Livers did not touch the floor, he 

still remained an active and key voice on the 

sidelines for Michigan. 

“At the end of the day, Isaiah is very 

disappointed he’s not out there to help his 

teammates,” Howard said. “(But) being 

on the bench, having his presence, his 

leadership, his voice, he is helping.”

The Wolverines nearly pulled off a 

13-point comeback in the game’s final six 

minutes, but ultimately lost, 68-67, after 

graduate guard Mike Smith missed a step-

back three at the buzzer. While the loss 

signifies the end of Michigan’s Big Ten 

Tournament run, its NCAA Tournament 

tale is still waiting to be written.

And if Livers has it his way, he’ll be out 

there to help author it.

“I don’t want people to write me off yet,” 

Livers said. “Still gonna rehab and work my 

butt off to get back with this team because 

I know we’re going to make a run and I’m 

gonna be there for it.”

United States Paralympic hopeful Leo Merle joins Michigan ASAF

Earlier this month, Michigan’s 

Adaptive Sports and Fitness (ASAF) 

program scored a significant addi-

tion to their ranks with the news that 

track and field athlete and 2021 U.S. 

Paralympic team hopeful Leo Merle 

would be joining the team. 

Merle will be the second interna-

tionally competitive track and field 

athlete to join the program, the first 

being the decorated Cathryn Gray. 

Now, with two elite athletes repre-

senting the track and field arm of the 

program, it’s seemingly only a matter 

of time before the accolades follow.

Merle arrives with a considerable 

reputation. He’s the current U23 

national record holder in the 5k for 

his para-athletic classification with a 

time of 16:58.

“I have times that are faster than 

that, but because I wasn’t declared 

a para-athlete just yet, they don’t 

count,” Merle said. “I don’t have any 

qualms with that, but I know I can 

run faster.”

Despite the fact that he’s now 

in contention for a spot on the U.S. 

Paralympic team this summer, Merle 

started competitive running relative-

ly late. Only in his junior year of high 

school did Merle really begin to take 

running seriously. Luckily, Merle 

is an adept learner. As a teenager, 

he picked up competitive shooting 

after posting a perfect score on the 

very first occasion he held a shotgun. 

Within a few years, he was competing 

at international competitions, being 

coached by a world champion and 

looking into potential Olympic oppor-

tunities for 2016. 

Ultimately, Merle chose to drop 

competitive shooting to focus on his 

academics and running. However, 

the pace at which Merle became an 

elite competitor at the sport is a testa-

ment to his intelligence, diligence and 

overall athletic ability.

After graduating from high school, 

Merle enrolled at the University of 

California, Santa Cruz in his native 

state of California. There, he com-

peted as a Division III track and field 

athlete for four years, participating 

in countless events and posting com-

petitive times. However, one thing 

set him apart from his competitors 

— Merle has cerebral palsy, a disor-

der that affects mobility, posture and 

balance. 

“I didn’t know about the broad 

spectrum of para-athletics until my 

junior year (of college) when I started 

doing the research and signing up for 

nationals and whatnot,” Merle told 

The Daily. “I didn’t have any special 

accommodations and I didn’t really 

think anything of it.”

In 2019, as a college junior, Merle 

competed in Minnesota at the U23 

U.S. Nationals. There, he had his 

first-ever physical evaluation for clas-

sification as a para-athlete. 

“As I was letting them know what 

I was running for the 15k and the 5k, 

they kind of just stopped and were 

like, ‘Okay, there’s some people you 

should start talking to to get more 

information about (para-)athletics,’ ” 

Merle said. 

At that very same competition, 

his first as a para-athlete, Merle went 

on to set the U23 national record for 

the 5k among T-38 (a disability sport 

classification for those with cerebral 

palsy) athletes. 

“I didn’t realize the actual speed 

that I had,” Merle said. 

Once taken into the fold of 

para-athletics, Merle set his sights on 

qualification for the U.S. Paralympic 

Team that will compete in Tokyo this 

summer. Merle is in constant contact 

with his coach from the U.S. Paralym-

pic Team, who prescribes his training 

regimen and modifies it based on how 

Merle is feeling and progressing. 

As one would expect, training for 

this once-in-a-lifetime event hasn’t 

come without obstacles. In January, 

Merle slipped on an ice patch while 

leaving the library one night. While 

falling, Merle tweaked a muscle that 

kept him from running for almost 

two months. 

“I was so mad,” Merle said. “This 

was when I was supposed to be ramp-

ing up, not sitting on a stationary 

bike. I was thinking that if this really 

affects my ability to race the time I 

need to race, that’s really messed up.” 

In some ways, however, the injury 

was a blessing in disguise for Merle. 

In a visit with a Michigan Physical 

Therapist, Merle was introduced to 

and given the contact information for 

the ASAF program. 

“One of the things that she men-

tioned that I’ve always had a fasci-

nation with and wanted to do was 

expanding education about adaptive 

sports and physical disabilities for 

athletes and people in general,” Merle 

said. “I’d be bummed if I didn’t make 

the U.S. team for the Paralympics, but 

at the end of the day, the larger impact 

I want to have is to extend that invi-

tation.”

In addition to the injury setback, 

Merle has had a lot on his plate 

while training for Tokyo — Merle is 

the president of his first-year dental 

school class in the Michigan School of 

Dentistry.

“It’s definitely a lot of time man-

agement,” Merle said. “As of right 

now, I would say that I’ve been doing 

a pretty good job of it. The one thing 

that I have to keep in mind first and 

foremost is that school is priority 

number one.”

The Paralympic trials are in June, 

where Merle will finally find out 

whether his many months of training 

have earned him a seat on the plane to 

Tokyo. Admittedly, Merle describes, 

there’s work to be done before then if 

he’s to be selected. Historically, Merle 

is a distance runner, competing in 

events like the 5k, 8k and 10k. Howev-

er, for the T-38 physical classification, 

the longest distance event available to 

him to compete in at the Paralympics 

is the 1500 meter.

“It’s a pretty large switch for me 

compared to some other athletes who 

have already been doing this,” Merle 

said. “I’ve had to start doing a lot more 

weightlifting and a lot more speed 

work which I haven’t really done.”

Despite having to significantly 

transform his running style, Merle is 

already running times nearly 30 sec-

onds faster than the Paralympic stan-

dard for the 1500 meter of 4:45, with 

a personal best of 4:19. However, to 

meet the standards specific to the U.S. 

team, Merle will have to cut a further 

seven seconds off that time in order to 

be at the threshold. Ultimately, Merle 

aims to have a personal best of around 

4:10 by the time June rolls around. 

“I’ll need to cut about a handful 

of seconds per race, which sounds 

impossible,” Merle said. “But from 

when I ran my personal best, I’ve got-

ten a lot stronger, I’ve gotten a little bit 

older so I’ve had a little bit more mus-

cle development, so my body is going 

to be able to respond much more 

quickly.”

Going forward, Merle’s role as 

part of the ASAF program will be 

twofold. Given his potential status 

as a Paralympian, the hope is that by 

joining ASAF, Merle will bring noto-

riety and attention to the program. 

At races and competitions, Merle 

will now compete under the banner 

of Michigan ASAF and wear pro-

gram-branded gear. In turn, ASAF 

will support the costs of Merle’s 

registration and travel to and from 

events. 

“We want to make it clear that hey, 

we’re brand new, but we still have 

people that are world-class at what 

they do,” Merle said.

Additionally, those within the 

program believe that the addition of 

Merle will make it clear to Michigan 

that ASAF and the strong foundation 

it has built represents an opportunity 

for the University to support the pro-

gram and establish itself as a leader in 

adaptive sports.

“With Leo joining the program we 

now have a roster of accomplished 

athletes who have bright futures 

ahead of them,” Erik Robeznieks, 

Michigan ASAF Program Manager, 

said. “It would be a missed oppor-

tunity if these athletes didn’t get the 

support, access and opportunity that 

is afforded to able-bodied athletes at 

the institution.”

Robeznieks cites a plaque com-

memorating Michigan Olympians 

that hangs in the Michigan Varsity 

Track and Field Center as an embod-

iment of his hopes for how Michigan 

should back ASAF: 

“Given the caliber of athletes in 

our program, and with support from 

all levels of the system, we have the 

opportunity to be leaders and the 

best,” Robeznieks said. “For the Uni-

versity of Michigan, it is difficult to 

conceive of better timing to start sup-

porting ‘Michigan Olympians and 

Paralympians.’ ”

In addition to competing under 

the banner of Michigan ASAF, Merle 

will work with program staff and 

Services for Students with Disabil-

ities at Michigan to provide and 

expand education about adaptive 

sports to students and community 

members. For Merle, this role is the 

more significant of the two.

“You can inspire a lot of people 

by being an athlete who competes at 

the Olympics or Paralympics,” Merle 

said. “But by making a local impact 

and expanding education, those peo-

ple can then go on to wherever they 

go in their lives to leave an impact 

that is equal to or greater than mine.”

Redshirt sophomore left-hander Steven 

Hajjar stood on the mound in a tough 

position. It was the top of the third inning 

of the first game with the score tied, 1-1, 

and Purdue had the bases loaded without 

a single out or strike. After consulting with 

pitching coach Steve Merriman, Hajjar 

decided to stay in and pull his team out of 

the hole in which they’d found themselves.

One by one, he retired each of the 

Boilermakers’ next three batters, letting 

out an emphatic roar as he approached 

Michigan’s bullpen. After that inning, 

the Wolverines would go on to win the 

game with eight unanswered runs and a 

dominant fielding performance.

Hajjar’s heroics were indicative of 

Michigan’s pitching and defense for the 

rest of this series, with Michigan holding 

Purdue without a run for 22 straight 

innings until the Boilermakers scored in 

the seventh inning of the third game. 

In the first game, Hajjar was relieved 

after the sixth inning by junior right-hander 

Will Proctor, redshirt junior right-hander 

Isaiah Paige and freshman left-hander 

Logan Wood, each of whom played an 

inning and gave up just a combined two 

hits through the rest of the game. 

By preventing Purdue from reaching the 

plate for the rest of the game, Michigan 

asserted its command on both sides of 

the ball from the get-go, demoralizing its 

opponent for the rest of the series.

Michigan coach Erik Bakich credits 

Hajjar’s third inning for leading them to 

the win.

“The probability of scoring multiple 

runs (in that situation) is extremely 

high,” Bakich said. “So for (Hajjar) to 

get a strikeout then a pop-up and then a 

strikeout was just a momentum-shifting 

moment in the game that helped our team 

capitalize so that we could score some runs 

and separate the game.”

No game exemplified Michigan’s mental 

hold on the Boilermakers more than the 

third game, with redshirt junior left-

hander Ben Dragani starting on the mound. 

Dragani threw an impressive 47 strikes 

and five strikeouts on his own, equaling 

Hajjar’s total from game one and all totals 

from game two. 

After 
junior 
right-hander 
Keaton 

Carattini relieved Dragani after the fifth 

inning, Michigan continued to protect the 

plate and position their offense for runs, 

including a grand slam by sophomore 

catcher/infielder Jimmy Obertop. Carattini 

was relieved by senior left-hander Angelo 

Smith, who gave up a run in each of the 

seventh and ninth innings but closed out a 

comfortable 9-2 Wolverine win.

By the final game of the series, Michigan 

completed its sweep of Purdue with an 

11-6 win. Senior right-hander Blake Beers 

started for the Wolverines, retiring the 

Boilermakers in each of the first and 

second innings. 

Michigan ran into trouble at the top of 

the third inning when a string of errors 

led to three Purdue runs, giving the 

Boilermakers the lead. Determined not 

to get swept, Purdue put together quality 

at-bats and trailed by just one run by the 

top of the sixth inning. 

That’s when graduate right-hander Joe 

Pace stepped onto the mound, focused on 

sending the Boilermakers home without a 

win. After having given up three runs in 

the fifth inning, Pace threw five strikeouts 

without giving up any runs, allowing his 

team to generate four unanswered scores 

to win the game.

To Pace, coaching and defense were 

what allowed him to close out the sweep.

“We have seven guys behind me that 

are great defenders,” Pace said. “It allows 

all of us on the pitching staff to pitch with 

the most confidence, so we trust our guys 

and it allows us to get on the mound and 

let it eat.”

Even with up and down offensive play 

for Michigan, the Wolverines’ depth on the 

mound allowed them to control the tempo 

of the series and will prove to be the key to 

their continued success at the top of the Big 

Ten.

“We do have unique depth at the starting 

pitcher position,” Bakich said. “That’s 

part of our strength too is when guys are 

called upon to perform in different roles 

they execute at that very well whether it’s 

starting, relieving, high leverage, margin 

or whatever. 

“The thing we’ve got consistency in is a 

lot of teammates who care more about the 

team’s success than their individual stats. 

… That consistency is what’s going to be 

the reason that we’ve had success this far 

and the number one reason why we will 

continue to have success in the future.”

Pitching leads Michigan to strong weekend performance

In a 2-1 game on Thursday night, 

with two outs in the bottom of the 

8th inning and runners threatening 

on second and third base, Michigan 

senior left-hander Meghan Beaubien 

stared down Nebraska’s Cam Ybarra. 

Beaubien then fired a pitch toward 

the plate, Ybarra barely made contact 

and the ball flew high into foul terri-

tory. 

Sophomore 
infielder 
Julia 

Jimenez charged in from her third 

base post, tracked the foul ball down 

and made the catch. The out not 

only put the No. 23 Wolverines’ soft-

ball team back in the win column to 

begin their six-game weekend series 

against Nebraska and Wisconsin, 

but it also completed Beaubien’s fifth 

career no-hitter. 

The 
no-hitter 
encapsulated 

what Michigan’s pitchers would do 

throughout its 5-1 weekend: dominate. 

Beaubien’s outing — where she 

also struck out 14 batters — occurred 

in the first game of the Wolverines’ 

double-header against the Corn-

huskers to open the weekend. In the 

back-end of the double-header, junior 

right-hander Alex Storako was tasked 

with following up Beaubien’s stellar 

performance in the circle with one of 

her own. 

She did just that. 

Storako pitched a complete game 

shutout, surrendered only one hit and 

threw 19 strikeouts, tying Beaubien’s 

program record that she notched 

against Purdue two weekends ago. 

“(Beaubien and Storako) were 

lights-out,” Michigan coach Carol 

Hutchins said of her co-aces’ Thurs-

day night starts. “They were absolute-

ly masterful.” 

These performances from Beaubi-

en and Storako keyed the Wolverines’ 

success against Nebraska. 

Not only did the offense struggle 

to produce in the double-header, 

scoring only two runs each game, 

but Michigan also had to contain 

Tristen Edwards. Edwards — the 

reigning Big Ten Player of the 

Week — entered the series with a 

.444 batting average, 1.000 slug-

ging percentage, three home runs 

and six RBIs. Beaubien and Storako 

kept the power-hitter at bay, limit-

ing her to a .143 batting average and 

just one RBI while striking her out 

three times over the three game 

series. 

“We weren’t going to let their best 

hitter beat us,” Hutchins said

When the Wolverines’ pitching 

performance dipped on Friday for 

the final game of the Nebraska series, 

so did their chances. Beaubien and 

Storako combined for an unchar-

acteristic four earned runs and the 

offense couldn’t pick up the slack en 

route to a 4-5 loss. Michigan’s pitch-

ing rotation got back into form for its 

three game series against Wiscon-

sin. Giving up only one earned run 

throughout the series, the Wolver-

ines swept the Badgers. 

Following a five inning run-rule 

shutout from Storako in the first 

game of Saturday’s double-header 

against Wisconsin, the Wolverines 

started senior right-hander Sarah 

Schaefer. The start was Schaefer’s 

first in-game action since 2019.

Throughout the young season, 

Hutchins has stressed the impor-

tance of finding reliable pitching 

to compliment Beaubien and Stor-

ako, especially since Michigan is 

enduring a compacted schedule 

in the shortened season. 

On Saturday, Schaefer answered 

the call. She posted three shutout 

innings, surrendering three hits and 

striking out a batter before Storako 

came in relief to complete the 3-0 vic-

tory for the Wolverines. 

“(Schaefer) was really well pre-

pared, both physically and mentally,” 

Beaubien said. “We need her to do a 

job, we need everyone to do a job, and 

she did her job.” 

Added Hutchins: “It’s hard enough 

to play the same team three times … 

they get on to your pitchers, you’ve 

got to have different looks. Schaefer 

has a much different look than Stor-

ako, and Storako and Schaefer both 

have different looks than Beaubien, so 

it can be very effective if we can make 

it work.” 

Over the weekend, Michigan’s 

pitchers certainly made it work. With 

slight improvements, but a continued 

lack of consistency from batters, once 

again the pitchers carried the mantle, 

this time to a strong 5-1 weekend.

No. 2 Michigan continues 
winning streak on senior day 

against No. 10 Minnesota

Staring down his target, senior Nick 

Guy readied for his last ever run on the 

floor at Cliff Keen. All eyes fell onto him 

as he began his charge into the final pass, 

yet to stick it this year. Guy leapt into the 

air as the crowd fell into a hush. Both feet 

came down and landed on the mat, no 

movement or lean. The crowd erupted, 

celebrating the best performance of the 

day on the floor.

The 
No. 
2 
Wolverines’ 
men’s 

gymnastic team (6-0 overall, 5-0 Big 

Ten) continued its winning streak over 

Minnesota (1-4, 1-4), with a final score of 

412.800-384.400.

“If it’s going to be my last night in Cliff 

Keen Arena I definitely want to finish at 

the highest point I can,” Guy said.

Sunday’s meet against the Gophers 

highlighted Michigan’s seniors, who 

have been a dominant force so far this 

season. Along with senior captains 

Cameron Bock and Jacob Moore, Guy 

and the rest of the seniors were honored 

at the end of the night with plaques and 

gifts, surrounded by their family.

“Our captains are a really strong 

influence on everyone and how the team 

performs,” sophomore Markus Shears 

said.

However, on Sunday, this praise did 

not come unwarranted. The Wolverines’ 

seniors took home the top score in every 

event besides the high bar and vault, 

which were both won by sophomore Paul 

Juda.

“They are the glue,” Michigan coach 

Kurt Golder said. “I have been with 

them for four or five years. They are just 

a fantastic group and I am going to miss 

the heck out of them. I wish they were 

staying another year or even a few more 

years beyond that.”

It became clear that this senior 

leadership was what motivated the 

Wolverines from the get-go, with 

Michigan taking a double-digit lead 

after the first events concluded. This was 

accomplished on the floor with a solid 

performance by Moore, who took home 

a 14.150, trailing only Guy with a score of 

14.250. On pommel horse, the Wolverines 

continued their hot streak by taking the 

meet’s top four scores. Michigan’s time 

on pommel horse was highlighted with 

a career-high of 14.050 from Shears, who 

trailed only Bock with a 14.200.

As the meet advanced into the 

second round, it became evident that 

Minnesota would not be able to keep 

up with the Wolverines. Tough falls 

and an injury to Andrew Hyde did not 

help the Gophers’ efforts in mounting a 

comeback. Michigan did not let up and 

took the top five highest scores on still 

rings. Minnesota’s Ben Eyles made an 

effort to stop the Wolverine dominance, 

earning the Gopher’s best score of the 

day on vault, but Eyles only scored third 

overall behind Guy (14.600) and Juda 

(14.700).

With only two events remaining, 

the Wolverines boasted a 20-point lead 

over the Gophers. Bock appeared last on 

parallel bars for Michigan, earning the 

highest score of the meet (14.550). On 

the high bar, Juda capped off a dominant 

night for the Wolverines with the top 

score of 14.550.

With a 6-0 start, the Wolverines have 

high hopes for the remainder of the 

season, having started to realize the true 

potential of this team.

“Going into the postseason, the teams 

to beat are Stanford and Oklahoma, but 

I would say we are right with them,” 

senior James Read said. “I would say they 

should be scared.”

Added Guy: “We are getting into 

the process of getting consistent and 

knowing that every routine we put up 

and every guy that we have in our lineup 

is trustworthy and can score well for us.”

An almost perfect meet left Golder 

proud of his team and his seniors, but 

Michigan recognizes that there remains 

a way to go. 

“We do not want to peak just yet, but 

we are close,” Golder said.

Tough loss shows the danger of two-goal leads

A two-goal lead is the worst lead 

in hockey. 

It’s an old saying in the sport, 

but for the Michigan hockey team, 

Monday night’s crushing 3-2 over-

time loss proved it’s one that still 

holds true. 

Through 40 minutes of action, 

the Wolverines looked well on their 

way to the Big Ten Tournament 

championship game. They scored 

an early goal, forced Minnesota to 

chase the game and held a com-

manding 2-0 lead. 

But that two-goal lead turned out 

to be a detriment. Getting a second 

goal can cause a team to ease up 

defensively and try to coast their 

way to the finish. Michigan had its 

eyes on that finish line, but Minne-

sota thought differently. 

“Anytime you give up a goal, it 

gives the team who scores some 

life and energy and they fed off of 

that,” Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

said. “(They) got a bad break, a bad 

bounce and scored that second goal 

and, from that point on, it’s any-

body’s game.”

The Wolverines gave up an early 

third period goal as the puck found 

its way through the five hole of 

junior goalie Strauss Mann. The 

margin for error tightened and sud-

denly, Minnesota had momentum 

after finding itself on life support 

just moments earlier.

Michigan now clung to a one-

goal lead but responded with a flur-

ry of chances to push the lead back 

to two — including a breakaway 

attempt from freshman forward 

Thomas Bordeleau. But as time 

dwindled down, it was the Golden 

Gophers who had the momentum. 

“We had a couple of real good 

looks to expand the lead to 3-1 and 

we couldn’t,” Pearson said. “(Min-

nesota) kept hanging around.”

With five minutes to go, a wrist 

shot from Minnesota forward 

Sampo Ranta took an awkward 

bounce and found its way past 

Mann again, tying the game at 

two. 

“I think they were two pretty 

weird goals,” junior defenseman 

Nick Blankenburg said. “We have 

Strauss’s back. Sometimes you just 

have those nights.”

The once-secure two goal lead 

had evaporated. The goals may not 

have been textbook or flashy, but 

nonetheless, Michigan had taken 

its foot off the gas and allowed 

the Golden Gophers to generate a 

majority of the chances in the final 

minutes. The game had complete-

ly flipped. 

Even if it took overtime, it felt 

like it was only a matter of time 

until Minnesota was going to win 

the contest. 

The overtime period proved 

that to be a correct assumption. 

The Golden Gophers dominated 

possession and just six minutes 

in, Minnesota forward Sammy 

Walker buried a rebound attempt 

to complete the comeback. 

Monday’s stunning defeat rep-

resented a major missed oppor-

tunity for Michigan. As they 

entered the third period up 2-0, 

it appeared the Wolverines had 

done everything they needed to 

do to propel themselves to the title 

game — and more importantly 

have a shot at an automatic bid.

But instead, they stumbled and 

the old adage about two goal leads 

remained true. 

Prior to this game, Michigan 

was 12-0 in games when it got 

the first goal. Getting out to fast 

starts has been a point of emphasis 

for the team all year. But against 

a talented team like the Golden 

Gophers, taking care of that lead 

turned out to be a lot more diffi-

cult. 

Michigan will still likely make 

the NCAA Tournament regardless 

of this result. But now, the Wolver-

ines will have to wait until Sunday 

to hear their postseason fate. 

“I don’t think this is their last 

game,” Pearson said. “But you 

never know.”

Jaaron Simmons waited for a 

phone call — one that would dic-

tate the future of both his bur-

geoning family and coaching 

career. 

It was mid-April 2020 and 

video analyst David Metzen-

dorf had left the Michigan men’s 

basketball team for an assistant 

coaching position at the Air Force 

Academy. Simmons, at the end of 

his year-long stint working along-

side Metzendorf as a graduate 

assistant on the Wolverines’ staff, 

wanted the job and knew he could 

step in right away. He just had to 

convince Michigan coach Juwan 

Howard of the same.

“‘Hey Coach, I know how to do 

everything,’ in a nutshell that’s 

what I was saying,” Simmons told 

The Daily. “‘I can continue where 

Dave left off. We won’t miss a 

beat. I promise you,’ that’s what I 

was telling him, ‘I promise you we 

won’t miss a beat.’ ” 

Just days earlier, Simmons had 

been offered the video analyst 

role at the University of Illinois at 

Chicago, where former Michigan 

assistant, Luke Yaklich, had been 

named the head coach. While 

grateful for the opportunity, Sim-

mons wanted to stay in Ann Arbor. 

His girlfriend was pregnant with 

their first child and moving across 

state lines wasn’t an ideal scenar-

io. 

Sure enough, 24 hours after 

their initial conversation, Howard 

called him back.

“He’s like, ‘You good. You can 

stay stationary. You don’t have to 

move the family. I want to offer 

you the position to be our video 

coordinator,’ ” Simmons said. 

“You know, I accepted it and I’m 

still here.”

Added Michigan assistant Saddi 

Washington: “To Jaaron’s credit, 

he did a great job of learning the 

video and adding tools to his tool-

belt so when these opportunities 

came, he could advocate for him-

self to slide into those roles.” 

Jean Dolores Schmidt was hav-

ing a blast. 

The 98-year-old nun, better 

known as Loyola Chicago super-

fan Sister Jean, looked on as her 

11-seed Ramblers were on the 

brink of yet another upset — this 

time in the 2018 Final Four. 

With just 11:46 remaining in the 

game, Loyola Chicago took a nine-

point lead over 3-seed Michigan. 

The Wolverines needed a spark 

and Jaaron Simmons obliged. 

The backup point guard hit just 

his sixth 3-pointer of the season to 

ignite a 17-4 run over the next six 

minutes and vault Michigan into 

the 2018 National Championship 

game, where it would eventually 

lose to Villanova. For Simmons, 

though, who had joined the Wol-

verines as a graduate transfer 

from Ohio University prior to the 

season, the run was a dream come 

true. 

“I had never played in the 

NCAA Tournament to that point,” 

Simmons said. “So from game 

one, with (Zavier Simpson) get-

ting in foul trouble against Mon-

tana, I think, and me getting into 

the game, that was memorable. 

Just stepping on the floor for the 

first time. Then you fast forward 

to being out in Los Angeles and 

playing Texas A&M. We’re far 

from Michigan and there’s a lot of 

Michigan fans you know, we filled 

that arena. That was eye-opening 

for me and that was the reason 

that I came to Michigan, because 

of that Block ‘M,’ because of the 

alumni and the fans that travel. 

“… I can’t pick one moment but 

it was all just a great experience.” 

Team success aside, that season 

was hardly all sunshine and rain-

bows for Simmons. 

During his two years with the 

Bobcats — he sat out the 2014-2015 

season after transferring from the 

University of Houston after his 

freshman season — the Dayton, 

Ohio native averaged 15.7 points, 

7.2 assists and earned first-team 

All-MAC honors as a senior. Upon 

joining the Wolverines though, he 

played a measly eight minutes per 

game off the bench as a graduate 

transfer. 

“It was extremely difficult,” 

Simmons said. “Throughout my 

career, pretty much my whole life, 

I’d been a starter, one of the main 

guys on the team. A leader on the 

team. So to become a role player in 

my last year, it was difficult.”

Grounded by his desire to win 

and earn a master’s degree from 

Michigan, though, Simmons never 

checked out on the team — some-

thing that both his teammates and 

coaches took note of. 

“I always tell people this, from 

the first day, that kid’s humbleness 

and competitive nature was a big 

reason why we were able to make 

it to Monday night,” Washington 

said. “Because there are programs 

where guys are in that situation 

and they become problematic in 

the locker room, become a distrac-

tion or become a cancer. Jaaron 

was just the opposite. He’s always 

been a giver.”

Added Simmons’s mother, Sar-

ita Simmons: “I think it built a lot 

of character in him as far as ‘You 

can’t have everything your way. … 

You can play basketball but you’re 

there to get your education.’ He 

was like ‘Okay, I’ll keep going.’ He 

was not a quitter, so he was not 

going to quit.” 

Faced with the disappoint-

ment of a reduced role, Simmons 

learned how much he loved the 

game of basketball that season. 

Devoid of the notoriety and acco-

lades he had achieved previously, 

he still had to show up every day, 

work as hard as any of the starters, 

cheer them on from the sidelines 

and, most importantly, perform 

when his name was called. 

On a team with 10 underclass-

men, the 22-year-old Simmons 

counseled his teammates as only 

an experienced college player 

could. 

“Jaaron helped me,” Isaiah Liv-

ers, a freshman at the time, said. 

“You hear about freshmen strug-

gling during their first year on 

campus, being away from home, 

not understanding college bas-

ketball or the new system. Jaaron 

was like that big brother for me. 

He was a guy who took me under 

his wing. If me, (Eli Brooks) and 

(Jordan Poole) were struggling 

during practice or a game, he’d 

pull us aside and say, ‘Hey, man. 

Everything’s all right. There’s 

more stuff to worry about than 

worrying about your performance 

or a practice. You gotta move on.’ 

… I’ll never, ever forget what he did 

for me.”

Whether Simmons meant to or 

not, he became a coach that sea-

son. 

Scouting is equal parts science 

and art. While it requires the 

highly-mechanical task of sifting 

through hours of game tape to 

identify everything from an oppo-

nent’s ball-screen coverages to its 

baseline plays, it also requires a 

discerning eye to pick out nuanc-

es and how to best exploit those 

tendencies. This is what keeps 

Simmons in the office late into the 

night. 

After Michigan’s student man-

agers have downloaded, coded 

and saved film of the Wolverines’ 

next opponent, Simmons parses 

through about four to five games, 

records his observations and then 

exchanges notes with the assistant 

coach assigned to that specific 

scout. It’s an interaction predicat-

ed on equal standing between the 

two parties, and one that Simmons 

has become increasingly comfort-

able with. 

“He’ll present an idea to you,” 

Michigan associate head coach 

Phil Martelli said. “He’ll even 

come down after seeing what 

I have written up and the film 

has been produced and he’ll say, 

‘Hey, what do you think about 

this or what do you think about 

that idea?’ because he has seen so 

much of this film. … He’s much 

more assertive in that way this 

year and maybe last year at times 

he felt like he was still a player, like 

he was still connected with those 

guys. He has clearly moved to the 

point where he sees himself very, 

very tied to the staff.”

For Simmons, that newfound 

confidence is a byproduct of 

preparation. 

“If I had to say one thing I’d 

say that I learned to be a grinder 

in the office,” Simmons said. “I 

was always a hard worker on the 

court, getting my work in, trying 

to improve my game but coach 

Howard uses that term a lot, ‘Be a 

grinder,’ and I learned that it takes 

a lot to be a coach. It’s not just 

you come in and you try and tell 

guys what to do. There’s a lot that 

comes with it and I learned how to 

grind in the office.”

From there, Simmons creates 

digestible film packages for How-

ard and the players. In addition to 

a clip consisting of the opponents’ 

general actions and tendencies, he 

creates clips of individual players 

on the opposing team, giving each 

Michigan player a chance to hone 

in on their specific matchups. 

Everything is uploaded to their 

personal iPads for convenient 

viewing. 

Video is not just reserved for 

game days, though. 

“We watch a lot of practice 

film,” Simmons said. “We’ll have 

our scout team run the opposing 

team’s main sets and we’ll put that 

together to make sure we see the 

opposing team running their set, 

then we’ll show the scout team 

running their set and how well or 

bad we did defending it in prac-

tice.” 

Prior to the season, the NCAA 

increased the number of staff 

members allowed on the court 

during practice by two. How-

ard chose Simmons and Director 

of Basketball Operations Chris 

Hunter.

With the student managers tak-

ing over recording duties from the 

stands, Simmons has experienced 

the nitty-gritty of coaching like 

never before. Both he and the Wol-

verines have benefited. 

“His feel for the game and 

knowledge of the game is help-

ful for our staff because it’s just 

another set of eyes that gets to see 

things from a player perspective,” 

Washington said. “And now, he’s 

grown so much by watching so 

much video. He’s watching it from 

a coaching perspective now and 

his advice and his recommenda-

tions are a lot of times on point.”

Added Livers: “Him actually 

playing the game, he understands 

a lot more. He can put himself in 

that situation and be like, ‘Hey, 

this is what you can do on the 

floor. Let’s work on this today.’ 

That’s the type of stuff that he can 

recognize, because he has a feel 

for the game, especially being a 

point guard.”

In his current role, Simmons 

also 
coordinates 
the 
team’s 

recruiting events — which this 

year revolve around Zoom calls 

rather than in-person visits. From 

reaching out to a recruit and his 

family, to operating informative 

powerpoints during the Zoom 

calls and developing, you guessed 

it, film of Michigan’s style of 

play, Simmons is the logistical 

point-person. 

“If there’s a player that (the 

recruit) might be similar to on our 

team now, we’ll put together clips 

and kinda show them our style of 

play and basically where they fit 

in,” Simmons said. “That’s my job, 

to paint that picture for them and 

make sure that they see this is a 

place where they can thrive and 

be successful.”

So far, so good. The Wolver-

ines’ incoming class features 

two five stars, three McDonald’s 

All-Americans and four top-

100 players, making it the No. 1 

recruiting class in the country 

per 247Sports. Howard and the 

rest of the coaching staff might 

be the faces of the operation, but 

Simmons plays an essential part 

in the pitch.

“If there’s an unsung hero in 

recruiting, it’s him,” Martelli 

said. 

At this stage of Simmons’s 

young career, every moment is a 

learning opportunity. Just like 

analyzing film and participating 

in practice, his involvement in 

recruiting is a mutually beneficial 

exercise — he puts forth the effort 

and receives insight in return. 

“That’s my favorite part of the 

(recruiting) call,” Simmons said. 

“When I get to turn my camera 

off, turn my mic off and I can just 

listen. I feel like I learn so much 

during those times because we 

have some great recruiters on 

this staff. … They do such a good 

job connecting with these fami-

lies and being genuine. What I’m 

always saying behind the cam-

era is, ‘Man, we would get every 

kid if they knew that everything 

they’re saying on this Zoom call, 

this is real. We really live this 

every day. This is our culture.’ ”

Union 
Neuchâtel 
was 
in 

the midst of another coaching 

change. The Swiss basketball 

club, located just 30 kilometers 

from the French border, had just 

hired its third coach of the sea-

son. It was only December. 

Simmons — who had signed 

with the team just months after 

Michigan’s 2018 Final Four run 

— quickly realized that his pri-

orities laid elsewhere, an ocean 

away. 

“We did speak to him daily 

while he was there,” Sarita Sim-

mons said. “It was just a little 

rough being that far away from 

home. I think that was the issue, 

so it didn’t work out the way he 

planned there.” 

Added Jaaron: “As a child, I 

never dreamed of going overseas 

to play professionally. I dreamed 

of playing in the NBA, obvious-

ly, but a lot of people are con-

tent with going overseas if they 

don’t make it to the NBA. Me, on 

the other hand, I was definitely 

appreciative and thankful, and 

going into it I wanted to make the 

most out of it and make it work 

but being overseas, that kinda 

wasn’t for me. So it was kinda eas-

ier for me to hang it up and move 

in a different direction.”

His dreams of playing profes-

sional basketball behind him, 

Simmons switched gears entirely 

— or so he thought. He returned to 

Ann Arbor to finish his two-year 

master’s program at Michigan 

with no intention of becoming 

a graduate assistant. But when 

Juwan Howard, newly-appoint-

ed as the coach of the Wolver-

ines, reached out and offered him 

the position, Simmons’s outlook 

changed entirely.

“From day one, I knew this is 

where I needed to be,” Simmons 

said. “It was kinda like a call-

ing from God that I transitioned 

immediately from playing over-

seas to the coaching world. Since 

that day that I stepped foot in 

this office on the other side of the 

game, I’ve been in love with it.” 

As for his future plans, Sim-

mons intends to do what he’s 

always done — put his head down, 

work hard, take every opportu-

nity in stride and let the rest fall 

into place. 

“Short term, I just want to con-

tinue to learn,” Simmons said. 

“Long term, the way my life has 

gone, I’m just going to wait for the 

opportunities. Whatever opportu-

nity presents itself that’s the best 

for me and my family, that’s the 

opportunity I’m going to take. … 

I just want to take it one day, one 

year at a time. That’s pretty much 

how I operate. I don’t want to get 

too far ahead of myself.” 

In the meantime, Simmons 

will just keep flourishing behind-

the-scenes of one of college bas-

ketball’s premier programs. Just 

don’t expect him to be there much 

longer. 

“He’s been a star in his role as 

a video analyst,” Washington said. 

“He’s going to be a star one day if 

he decides to take the coaching 

path.”

At 
long 
last, 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament is back. After a one-

year, pandemic-induced hiatus, the 

tournament returns to captivate 

and devastate. The Michigan men’s 

basketball team will embark on 

its journey through the madness 

on Saturday at 3 p.m., when it 

will play the winner of the first 

four matchups between Mount 

St. Mary’s and Texas Southern in 

West Lafayette. 

The announcement, considering 

the heralded feat of attaining a No. 

1 seed, seemed a tad humdrum. 

As little as two weeks ago, the 

Wolverines appeared primed to tear 

through March. Now, their fate is 

somewhat precarious. A semifinal 

exit in the Big Ten Tournament, 

coupled with a stress fracture in 

senior forward Isaiah Livers’s foot, 

dampened the hoopla. 

And yet, Michigan earned a 

top seed — the program’s first 

since 1993 — along with an 

outright regular-season Big Ten 

championship for a reason. Even 

without Livers, the Wolverines 

possess the requisite talent to make 

a run. While they appear on the 

surface to have lost momentum, 

those 
within 
the 
program 

adamantly insist otherwise. 

“I think I’d be lying if not every 

single player in that locker room fully 

believes that we are the best team in 

the country and that we will win the 

National Championship,” freshman 

center Hunter Dickinson said on 

Saturday. “(We have) the utmost 

confidence in the rest of the players 

to step up.” 

Will the Wolverines rekindle their 

February fire and actually do so? The 

Daily men’s basketball beat writers 

take a stab at predicting Michigan’s 

postseason fate: 

Jared Greenspan: There’s been a 

lot of conversation about Michigan’s 

draw (as there always is), amongst 

pundits and fans alike, so let me 

preface my prediction with this: The 

Wolverines received a pretty fair 

draw. This is the NCAA Tournament. 

Each team in the field is here for a 

reason — they’re good. As simple as it 

sounds, it bears mentioning. 

All that being said, Michigan 

certainly faces a challenging path to 

the Final Four, one only amplified 

in difficulty should Livers be unable 

to suit up. Barring an utter disaster, 

the Wolverines will advance into 

the second round, where either LSU 

or St. Bonaventure awaits them. 

The Tigers, boasting the nation’s 

fifth-ranked offense, could leave 

a depleted, Livers-less Michigan 

attack in the dust. On the other 

hand, the Bonnies, champions of 

the Atlantic-10, are led by one of the 

nation’s stingiest defenses at 17th 

overall. Sans Livers, the Wolverines 

may struggle to counter.

Should Michigan get past the 

first weekend, the slate hardly gets 

any easier. Florida State, buoyed by 

7-foot-1 center Balsa Koprivica, is one 

of the few teams who stand equipped 

to slow down Dickinson. Should they 

clash with the Wolverines, the lanky 

and athletic Seminoles would be an 

undesirable opponent. 

With Livers, Michigan would be 

odds-on favorite to advance out of 

the East region and waltz into the 

Final Four. Without him, a successful 

season suffers a sour ending in the 

Sweet 16. 

Teddy Gutkin: While many 

will be quick to count coach Juwan 

Howard’s crew out in the absence 

of Livers, this is still a Michigan 

team that won a Big Ten regular-

season title. With the sixth-best 

offense and seventh-best defense 

in the nation according to KenPom, 

the Wolverines are still very much a 

team deserving of a No. 1 seed.

For the Round of 64, let’s be 

blunt: whether it’s Mount St. Mary’s 

or Texas Southern, Michigan will 

advance. Awaiting them will be either 

LSU or St. Bonaventure. Neither 

matchup will be easy, but in March 

nothing ever is. The Wolverines 

have faced tougher competition and 

thrived during the Big Ten season, 

and I see them squeaking out a close 

win over the Bonnies’ stout defense to 

advance to the Sweet 16.

In the Sweet 16, Michigan 

will likely meet Florida State. 

While the Seminoles possess 

tantalizing athleticism, I think 

the Wolverines will ride a hot 

shooting night from outside and 

a few timely defensive stops to 

secure a date with 2-seed Alabama 

in the Elite Eight. Unfortunately 

for Michigan, the Crimson Tide 

are one of the hottest teams in the 

country right now. Led by coach 

Nate Oats, Alabama has proven 

that it can win in a shootout or a 

dogfight. 

The Wolverines won’t be able to 

keep up without Livers. Michigan’s 

season ends on the doorstep of the 

Final Four.

Connor Brennan: Oh, how 

quickly the tables can turn. Just 

two weeks ago, Michigan stood as 

a prohibitive favorite to win the 

Big Ten Tournament and reach the 

National Championship. Since then, 

the Wolverines were demolished 

by Illinois, fell to Michigan State in 

their regular-season finale, bowed 

out of the Big Ten Tournament a 

day early — from their perspective, 

at least — and lost Livers to 

injury. Now, with its mid-season 

momentum seemingly shattered, 

many think Michigan is the 1-seed 

least likely to make the Final Four. I, 

for one, agree. 

While I’ve wavered back and 

forth about when the Wolverines 

might ultimately exit the NCAA 

Tournament, it’s entirely down to 

semantics and borders on irrelevant. 

As successful as Howard’s second 

season has been, anything less 

than the Final Four appearance 

will likely leave a bitter taste in the 

mouth of the Wolverines and their 

fans. The cabinet is certainly not 

bare, but without Livers, Michigan 

lacks one of its most essential 

ingredients. And so ultimately, the 

East Region won’t be won by the 

Wolverines — little else matters. 

For sake of predictions, though, 

I’ll be more specific. On Saturday 

afternoon, the Wolverines will 

thank either Mount St. Mary’s or 

Texas Southern for coming out, 

before 
dispatching 
them 
with 

relative ease. In the second round, 

Michigan will probably play LSU 

— my apologies, St. Bonaventure 

— and while the Tigers have 

impressed lately, they don’t have 

a player in their primary rotation 

over 6-foot-9. Dickinson could have 

a field day. 

Should the Wolverines make 

it to the Sweet 16, they would 

likely meet 4-seed Florida State, a 

trendy pick to beat Michigan. The 

Seminoles have five players who 

average at least one 3-pointer a 

game and forward RaiQuan Gray is 

a force on the boards. Led by senior 

guard Eli Brooks and sophomore 

wing Franz Wagner though, I 

think the Wolverines’ defense will 

do enough to slow down Florida 

State’s offense and advance to 

the Elite Eight. There, however, 

Michigan will meet its match in 

SEC Champion Alabama. Between 

do-it-all wing Herb Jones, 3-point 

specialist John Petty and Villanova 

transfer Jahvon Quinerly, the 

Crimson Tide can score with 

anybody — especially a Wolverine 

team missing the shotmaking 

presence of Livers.

Michigan will hope to capitalize on its success throughout the regular season by making a run in the postseason.

 MADELINE HINKLEY/Daily

Michigan coach Juwan Howard will coach in his first NCAA Tournament this year after last year was canceled.

It was just a slight movement.

It started from the heel, just a slight raise, before 

the hips and hands fired through and sent the baseball 

rocketing into right field. Fifth-year senior outfielder 

Christan Bullock used a no-stride, two-strike approach 

to rip an RBI single into right field in Sunday’s win over 

Purdue as part of the Michigan baseball team’s four-game 

sweep of the Boilermakers.

But Bullock wasn’t finished. He took second base on 

an overthrow into the infield and ended up scoring the 

go-ahead run on a single by sophomore infielder Jake Marti 

two batters later. This sequence acted as a microcosm 

of the series, as the Wolverines’ aggressive approach, 

headlined by Bullock, put pressure on the Boilermakers 

and led to an explosive offensive output. In addition to the 

aggressive approach Michigan employed, timely hits also 

helped the Wolverines distance themselves from Purdue.

“We had some great at-bats with two outs,” Bullock 

said. “We have the perfect mindset for the games.”

Michigan stole four bases on the weekend, with two 

by Bullock, including a double steal that allowed junior 

infielder Riley Bertram to score from third. Bullock also 

legged out a triple and stretched what appeared to be a 

routine single into a double in the third game of the series.

“It feels good to see everyone executing, from our 

pitchers, to our hitters, our fielders,” Bullock said. “But 

we’re always working on something and we’re definitely 

going to get back in the lab.”

From little adjustments like Bullock’s two-strike 

approach to aggressive baserunning, the Wolverines put a 

great deal of pressure on the Boilermakers, overwhelming 

their pitchers with their approach at the dish.

The Wolverines also utilized great two-out hitting 

to stifle Purdue. Michigan scored 17 of its 33 runs with 

two outs, capitalizing on the Boilermakers’ mistakes and 

executing when it mattered the most. Sophomore catcher 

Jimmy Obertop showcased the Wolverines’ offensive 

prowess with two outs this weekend, as he launched a two-

out grand slam in the first inning of the third game of the 

series, giving Michigan a lead it would never relinquish.

“The clutch hitting stood out for me,” Michigan coach 

Erik Bakich said. “We had the timely hitting throughout 

the weekend.”

Staying aggressive and executing was what got the 

job done for the Wolverines this weekend. With its 

roster locked in and playing sharp, Michigan can use its 

mentality and focus to bring continued success.

“I don’t even think we can call each other a team; we’re 

a family,” Bullock said. “We’re all bonded together, we’re 

all brothers and we all want to see each other succeed.”

Michigan earns first No. 6 seed in program history

After missing the NCAA tournament last year due 

to COVID-19, the Michigan women’s basketball team 

awaited its fate. 

The fate would be a No. 6 seed in the River Walk region. 

Michigan earned its highest seed in program history, 

with its previous best coming in the 2018 tournament 

when it earned a No. 7 seed. Michigan is joined in the 

region by fellow Big Ten school Iowa, who earned a No. 

5 seed. Michigan’s first game will be against No. 11 seed 

Florida Gulf Coast on Sunday at 3 p.m. If the Wolverines 

win, they will face the winner of 3-seed Tennessee and 

14-seed Middle Tennessee matchup on Sunday. 

The Eagles present a difficult challenge for the 

Wolverines. On a 24-game unbeaten streak, Florida 

Gulf Coast has yet to miss a game due to COVID-19 

— something Michigan can’t say, having missed 10. 

The Eagles are led by sophomore guard Kierstan Bell, 

who transferred from Ohio State. The dynamic point 

guard can score as well as feast on the glass, averaging 

24 points a game and 10.9 rebounds. Florida Gulf Coast 

is a team that loves to stroke it from beyond the arc, 

shooting 969 threes over the course of the season at a 

33% clip. Defending the 3-point line could be crucial to 

the Wolverine’s success. 

“They spread you out and play five out,” Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico said. “We played them a 

number of years ago in the WNIT and it’s hard for post 

players to play because they are guarding guards. It’s a 

tough matchup for anyone.”

Going unbeaten in their first 10 games, the Wolverines 

struggled toward the end of conference play. Michigan 

went out in the first round of the Big Ten Tournament to 

Northwestern, losing 49-65. Having previously beaten 

the Wildcats twice, the Wolverines struggled to find 

their shooting form and had early foul trouble. After 

three detail-oriented practices, Michigan switches gears 

to Florida Gulf Coast and their versatile offense. 

“(The tournament is) something we’re very excited 

for, to have the opportunity to play in the NCAA 

Tournament,” Barnes Arico said after the Northwestern 

loss on Thursday. “It’s something that we weren’t able 

to do last year. I like the fact that we have some time for 

preparation because our team could really use it.” 

The Wolverine’s No. 6 seed ranking has much to do 

with the department-wide 14-day pause in January, 

which caused Michigan to miss six games. It’s possible 

the Wolverines would have found themselves in a higher 

seed had the pause not occurred, as they struggled to 

recapture their early-season form during the last stretch 

of the year. At a point in its season when Michigan should 

be in prime fitness, it is still working towards its peak. 

“I keep a notebook of our practice plans every year 

and I wrote on practice plan 82 today,” Barnes Arico said. 

“Typically at this time, we’re on practice 102. That gives 

you a little bit of where we are.” 

The Wolverines have an opportunity against the 

Eagles in the NCAA Tournament. Florida Gulf Coast 

can do everything the Wolverines have struggled to do: 

Shooting 3-pointers, taking opponents off the dribble 

and winning games down the stretch.

After a slow finish, San Antonio presents Michigan 

with a chance to recapture its first-half magic and prove 

its doubters wrong along the way.

C

all me a naive romantic, but I believe 
in love at first sight. Why? Because I’m 
pretty sure it happened to me. 

When I bought tickets to see Icona Pop, an 

electro-pop band, at Necto Nightclub in the Fall 
2019, my expectations for the night included get-
ting ready in residence halls and screaming “I 
don’t care, I love it!” with my friends. My agen-
da did not include falling in love. It was only two 
months into my freshman year of college and I 
was basking in my newfound independence, not 
looking for commitments of any kind. I especial-
ly didn’t think I was destined to meet someone at 
Necto — a club notorious for nights of drunken 
regret — of all places.

If you’ve never been, believe me when I say 

Necto is one of the least romantic places on cam-
pus. It’s randomly stacked on top of a bookstore, 
unassuming from the outside. Inside, it’s grimy, 
with sticky floors from spilled beers and wasted 
college kids sloppily dancing all over each other. 
The vibe is chaotic, but also exhilarating; the am-
biance promises a chance to get lost in a crowd 
and forget to worry for a night.

Once inside, my friends and I were pushed 

onto the packed dance floor. I glanced around, 
vision spotty from the flashing lights, lost in a 
blur of twirling bodies until suddenly a compel-
ling force grabbed my attention. Whoa. My eyes 
locked with someone else’s gaze across the club. 
Something about this stranger was immediately 
captivating. It was as if we were old friends; his 
stare was familiar and comforting, but with a 
twinkling hint of excitement. Despite my initial 
plans, I felt as if this was my reason for coming 
to Necto all along and I was only just realizing. 
Something inside me clicked. I knew I had to 
talk to him. 

Yet without warning, he disappeared into the 

swallowing abyss of the club scene. Inevitably, I 
panicked, racing thoughts of how I’d never see 
him again pervading my mind. I knew I would 
forever wonder what could’ve been. Frustrated 
and upset, I turned back to my friends, trying to 
allow myself to once again get lost in the music 
— and to my surprise, there he was on the dance 
floor. 

In my mind, I casually walked up to him, 

smoothly introducing myself. In reality, I aggres-
sively ran towards him and awkwardly blurted 
out my name. I don’t usually trust random guys 
I meet in nightclubs, but for some reason, I had 
a gut feeling that he was special. Maybe it was 
his sweet smile or the way his stare made me 
feel safe and adored. Whatever it was, it led us to 
dance together all night and spend almost every 
day together that fall. The rest is history. We’re 
still together today, one and a half years later. 

Looking back, I like thinking this was love at 

first sight, but if I’m honest, I’m not entirely sure. 
It felt surreal at the moment, but the details are 
blurry now — maybe I added this fairytale de-
scription later, once I was truly in love. It could’ve 
been nothing more than the combination of a 

cute boy plus a carefree club atmosphere. 

Or maybe I did feel a promise of love in his 

stare. I know falling in love simply by looking at 
someone sounds crazy. I’d argue, however, that 
love itself makes no sense. It supersedes logic. 
It’s powerful, wrapping itself around your life 
and becoming the center of your world. And as 
John Lennon tells us, it’s “all you need.” 

With this in mind, I wanted to explore the 

idea of destiny’s true role in love. I wondered if 
the idea of love at first sight was something other 
people my age had experienced. Furthermore, I 
was determined to learn if love at first sight in-
dicated you’d found your “soulmate,” or if these 
ideas were separate, unrelated instances of fate.

I met with three women who shared their 

soulmate stories with me. They each brought 
differing views on the concepts of love at first 
sight and soulmate bonds. Even the word soul-
mate meant something totally different, depend-
ing on who I asked. 

I acknowledge these stories are solely from a 

female point of view and may not reveal a thor-
ough range of perspectives. That being said, their 
descriptions of soulmates were deeply powerful 
in aiding my understanding of destined relation-
ships. My view on what soulmates or love at first 
sight could look like shifted dramatically after 
talking with each of them. 

***
First, I met on Zoom with Emma Anderson, a 

freshman studying sociology and criminology at 
Ohio University. When Anderson met her boy-
friend, she fell in love at first sight, even under 
difficult circumstances — they were both enter-
ing a treatment facility that focuses on mental 
rehabilitation and substance abuse. 

Anderson instantly felt drawn to him, de-

scribing, “We saw each other across campus the 
first day and it was crazy.” She added, “As soon as 
I saw him, I was like, ‘I’m gonna fall in love with 
that kid.’”

According to Anderson, her partner agreed 

that he felt love at first sight too. In our interview, 
she explained to me that he has told her “I no-
ticed you and you just shined like a light. Out of 
every girl, it was you.” 

Despite their distressing surroundings, An-

derson emphasized, “It was exactly (the) right 
time, right place to meet him because we were 
both so lost.” The precariousness of the situation 
made their love stronger since they needed to 
overcome personal challenges for their relation-
ship to succeed.

They were also up against certain rules at 

the treatment center, as Anderson admitted, “we 
weren’t really allowed to talk to each other until 
we got to a certain level (in the program).” 

Their situation didn’t make falling in love 

simple, but they had a common goal in sight. As 
Anderson explained, “When we met, we wanted 
to better ourselves for the other person.” Con-
sidering the situation, she said this relationship 
was necessary to help bring them both to a better 

place within themselves. It seems like the timing 
was predestined. 

Anderson doesn’t think he’s her soulmate, 

though. Rather, this is her “twin flame.” 

“For (a) soulmate, I feel like your souls con-

nect and (with a) twin flame, it’s really about 
energy,” Anderson explained. In her mind, there 
are multiple people with whom she shares 
soul-level connections, like her fraternal twin 
whom she believes is another person destined to 
be in her life. 

“I would say (my twin is) my soulmate and 

(my boyfriend) is my twin flame, like my other 
half,” she said. While only one of these relation-
ships is romantic, they’re both on a deeper, pos-
sibly fate-driven level for her. 

Anderson’s twin flame relationship was 

high-stakes from the second they saw each oth-
er. However, not all soulmate or twin flame con-
nections begin with such powerful, all-consum-
ing feelings. 

For Art & Design sophomore Rachel Grabow, 

her soulmate wasn’t introduced as a romantic 
interest initially. 

Grabow has been dating her girlfriend for 

over a year now. On a Zoom call with me, she told 
me with a smile, “I think she is my soulmate.” 
She continued, “The first time I talked to her, it 
felt like I knew her forever,” a sentiment similar 
to that of what I felt at Necto. 

But at the start of their relationship, her part-

ner was still figuring out her sexuality. Though 
on the surface, this conflict may appear to be an 
obstacle, it didn’t deter their connection in any 
way. 

“It was so special that our relationship pro-

gressed from a best friend soulmate idea to some-
thing more romantic and intimate,” Grabow said. 

To Grabow, soulmates aren’t contingent on 

romantic attraction; they can adapt over time to 
fit the relationship. She elaborated on this defini-
tion, explaining that a soulmate is someone who, 
“complements you in a way that can make you 
feel special and loved unconditionally.” 

This is a broader definition compared to 

Anderson’s, in which she said such a connec-
tion indicates communion of souls or energy. In 
Grabow’s opinion, soulmates are less about an 
actual soul connection; rather, a soulmate can be 
anyone who consistently loves you. 

Their personal definitions reflect different 

backgrounds and core beliefs. Personally, my 
ideas of relationships and soulmates have been 
heavily influenced by fairytale love stories I grew 
up hearing. 

Most portrayals of soulmates or fated lovers 

in popular media follow exclusive storylines that 
support a heteronormative ideal. Our fairytales 
and media are full of unrealistic relationship 
standards which lead us to believe we must fit 
into strict stereotypes of either “Prince Charm-
ing” or a “damsel in distress.” However, soulmate 
relationships and love in general can appear in 
many other forms besides these limited tropes. 

None of the women I talked to shared stories 
which perfectly matched a fairytale descrip-
tion.

Grabow doesn’t believe these exclusive ide-

als impacted her view of love. 

“Heteronormativity was never really an is-

sue in my life, especially growing up,” Grabow 
said.“I have grown up surrounded by gay peo-
ple since I was really young.” 

She said she always knew she could love 

anyone, emphasizing, “I’m really lucky to have 
parents like that who aren’t just accepting but 
progressive in that way of how they raised me.” 
Her background cultivated an open mind of 
how love would look in her life.

That doesn’t mean she believes in love at 

first sight, though. When recalling the first 
time she saw her girlfriend, Grabow said, “That 
wasn’t love at first sight, but looking back on it, 
I could see feelings develop.” She continued, 
“Maybe we would call it (a) crush at first sight.” 
I like this idea, as it doesn’t come with all the 
labels and expectations of love with a capital L. 
It reminds me of Koi No Yokan, a Japanese term 
that essentially means, “The feeling upon first 
meeting someone that you will inevitably fall in 
love with them.” I imagine this idea like a seed, 
planted when two potential soulmates meet, 
which will someday blossom into love.

This seed, or premonition of love to come, 

resonates more with my experience at Necto. 
Perhaps my understanding of love at first sight 
as some monumental, life-changing experience 
doesn’t reflect reality. It could appear as an ini-
tial spark of Koi No Yokan. Feeling a crush or 
hint of love to come could indicate you’ve found 
your soulmate, as Grabow explained. 

***
In reality, soulmates don’t have to originate 

from our typical understanding of “love” as 
sexual or romantic feelings, but instead could 
appear in unexpected forms, like a friendship. 

For some, feelings of love never appear in a 

soulmate connection.

In a Zoom interview with Georgia Smith, 

a senior at Tamalpais High School in Marin 
County, Calif., I learned that soulmates don’t 
ever need to develop romantic feelings. Smith’s 
best friend is her soulmate since they’ve re-
mained extremely close since meeting in pre-
school. 

“(I have) always felt like I’m closer with her 

than my own sister. “No one else really com-
pares to that relationship.” 

Her soulmate connection lacks romantic 

feelings, but this doesn’t detract meaning from 
their relationship. To this point, Smith elaborat-
ed, “I haven’t found a romantic love that’s equal 
to the love I have for her.” This shows that soul-
mate connections can be just as fulfilling, even 
without romance. 

Is it love at first sight?

“

There is a Taoist story of an old farmer who 
had worked his crops for many years. One 
day his horse ran away. Upon hearing the 

news, his neighbors came to visit. ‘Such bad luck,’ 
they said sympathetically. ‘Maybe,’ the farmer 
replied.

The next morning the horse returned, bring-

ing with it three other wild horses. ‘How wonder-
ful,’ the neighbors exclaimed. ‘Maybe,’ replied the 
old man.

The following day, his son tried to ride one of 

the untamed horses, was thrown off and broke 
his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their 
sympathy on his misfortune. ‘Maybe,’ answered 
the farmer.

The day after, military officials came to the 

village to draft young men into the army. Seeing 
that the son’s leg was broken, they passed him 
by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer on 
how well things had turned out. ‘Maybe,’ said the 
farmer.”

***
I’ve always had issues figuring out and navi-

gating the ideas of chance, luck, fate. For instance, 
as I went through the college application process, 
I was convinced that there was only one place for 
me. Spoiler alert: That place was not the Universi-
ty of Michigan. And after a gruesome college ap-
plication process that seemed to keep kicking me 
while I was down, I finally decided on the Uni-

versity. 

T h o u g h 

impressive and 

honorable, 
my 

choice left me disap-

pointed and dis-

heartened. With 

what felt like 

years spent on a perfect application and resume, 
it didn’t feel right to end up at a university that 
wasn’t my dream school. 

However, experience has only furthered the 

idea that luck is much more complex than the col-
lege application process. One night, my stepdad 
and I were discussing the intricacies behind the 
concept that everything happens for a reason. He 
had shared a story with me, further complicating 
my seemingly never-ending struggle of trying to 
come to conclusive beliefs pertaining to luck, fate 
and chance. 

In 2014, my stepdad was led to believe by 

his aches and high fever that he had the flu. He 
called his doctor the next morning and went 
in for a brief examination later that afternoon. 
The doctor instructed him not to go home, but 
instead straight to the emergency room because 
he had been presenting the classic symptoms of 
appendicitis. He was rushed into surgery that 
night. Apparently, there are a few ways to re-
move an appendix. Commonly, doctors make a 
large incision near the appendix and remove it 
in one piece by cutting it out. Another method 
is through a laparoscopic procedure. There are 
two methods to this procedure: the first method 
is one in which tubes are inserted through two 
or three small incisions and the appendix is ei-
ther cut up into smaller pieces and removed, en-
closed in a net and removed in multiple pieces, or 

the second method in which the appendix is en-
closed in a plastic bag and removed in one piece. 
In either method, the bag or net is then pulled 
across the abdomen and taken out through one 
of the small incisions. Many surgeons have a 
preferred method, either by means of the net 
or plastic bag, when operating via laparoscopic 
procedure. When performing the approach on 
my stepdad, his surgeon, luckily, used the plas-
tic bag approach which completely enclosed his 
appendix upon taking it out. After sending his 
appendix to a lab following the removal, it was 
discovered that his appendix was full of cancer. 
It was never actually appendicitis. 
A 

week later when my stepdad went 
for his follow-up visit, his surgeon told 
him the shocking news: “For whatev-

er reason, you’re very lucky, because I removed 
your appendix enclosed in a plastic bag, and con-
sequently, none of your cancer cells were able to 
spread through the abdomen. Had I used the net 
approach, I would have been dragging the cancer 
cells straight across your abdomen, causing them 
to spread.” 

Was that because of mere coincidence? Was 

this luck? Or was it for some greater purpose that 
was for my stepdad to seek out? 

Maybe.
I found myself asking these questions again 

more recently. As the summer of 2019 was com-
ing to an end, my mom was diagnosed with 
leukemia. This diagnosis resulted in my mom 
needing a bone marrow transplant by the end of 
the year to save her life. The chances were not 
in our favor. The likelihood of getting a perfect 
match, which is what my mom needed to sur-
vive, is roughly 0.3%. The likelihood of a child of 
the person in need of a transplant being a perfect 
match is about 1%.

Yet against all odds, my mom received news 

that they had found a perfect match. 

My sister and I were both only half of a 

match, meaning the likelihood of our donation 
being a success was slim to none. This means my 
mother was one in 300 to receive a perfect trans-
plant from an absolute stranger. My family felt so 
lucky. And now, her donor Annie feels far from a 
stranger. It feels as if we were brought together 
through unfortunate circumstances and were 
meant, in a near unexplainable way, to meet. 

Annie got swabbed to be in the bone mar-

row registry through Be The Match 20 years 
ago when she was 18 years old as an under-
graduate student at Dartmouth College. There 
was a drive set up in what I imagine was Dart-
mouth’s version of The Diag. After being in the 
registry for 20 years, Annie got a phone call 
from Be The Match in late September 2019, 
letting her know that she was a preliminary 
match for a 52-year-old woman with leukemia 
— my mom. After getting further blood test-
ing and a physical, Annie was able to donate 
her bone marrow and subsequently save my 
mom’s life. 

Whenever I tell the story of my mom getting 

her transplant, I always say “We (my family) are so 
lucky,” or I get the response, “Wow, you are all so 
lucky.” 

Maybe.
Does everything happen for a reason? Can 

these questions be asked in even the most unthink-
able and traumatic of situations, when other fami-
lies in similar situations didn’t experience the same 
stroke of chance as mine? 

After a little over a year of reflection, I have 

come to terms with this series of events. I feel so 
fortunate that we got a perfect match. On top of 
that, I now have this person in my life who over-
laps so fiercely with everything I am a part of — 
academics and personal interests. Is it a stroke of 
luck or coincidence? Have there been other lucky 
aspects in my life where I just haven’t been paying 
attention?

Ultimately, I realized that there does not always 

have to be a reason for everything. Though every-
thing may not happen for some greater reason, 
possibly, everything happens for an opportunity. 
An opportunity to merge my family with Annie’s, 
through something of both great sorrow and great 
joy. An opportunity to get to know the kind per-
son who entered a bone marrow registry 20 years 
ago, and still actively chose to donate to a complete 
stranger, decades later. An opportunity to find out 
she is from a U-M family — her mom went to the 
University as an undergraduate student in the class 
of 1976 (and wrote for The Daily, even!), along with 
her brother in the class of 2007 and Annie, too, who 
received her MBA here. What a weird connection 
— a coincidence? Fate? 

Upon finding all of this out, I started thinking 

about how in life when we are dealt a really tough 
hand of cards, it sometimes takes getting through 
it to be able to see what was gained from it. See 
how we have grown, see how we were shaped by 
an experience and see how we are prepared for 
more difficult decks because of it. While I want 
to make it clear that I am not grateful for the or-
igins and thick of the experience, I do recognize 
that some things I am grateful for came out of it. I 
take pride in both how I, along with the rest of my 
family, grew from it and the people I got to know 
because of it.

I think deep down I continue to ask myself 

these questions and grapple with them because I 
am endlessly trying to find a justification for this 
horrible thing that happened to my family. Because 
I am not religious, when analyzing the ideas of, 
chance, luck and fate, or the common rationale of 
“everything happens for a reason,” I am left to my-
self on how I view the world. During difficult times 
like this, I try to ask these questions to find some-
thing to lean into or something to believe in to jus-
tify or explain this incidence for a larger purpose.

How I view the world has been shaped by my 

experiences and will continue to be shaped by my 
experiences. So even though in the moment, it may 
seem like the end of the world, I know I can look to 
the “maybe” moment of what could come out of it.

Is it luck? Maybe.

A

s I was sitting cross-legged lining up dom-
inos on my aunt’s kitchen floor, she told 
me the domino effect was teaching me to 

make good decisions in life. In my pig-tailed, youth-
ful wonder I couldn’t internalize her profound ad-
vice, but years later, I realized she was right. In the 
opening scene of “Collateral Beauty,” Will Smith’s 
character Howard seeks a resolution by setting off 
an impressive domino structure as he grieves the 
death of his six-year-old daughter to cancer. One 
flick of the wrist and rows upon rows of all colors of 
dominoes give way to intersecting paths, toppling 
structures and branches of dead ends. 

Last year, as one of the thousands of freshmen in 

a handful of residence halls, hundreds of hallways 
and numerous rooms, I ended up living across the 
hall from someone I played softball against in high 
school. I doubt I’ll ever know the probability of that 
happening, but it still feels like too much of a coinci-
dence. Of all the people that could have been placed 
in that exact room in 4th Butler of Mary Markley 
Residence Hall, she was someone who, before com-
ing to the University of Michigan, knew both me 
and my hometown. She was someone who shared 
my interest in playing club softball and was willing to 
take on all the boys in pickup basketball at the Cen-
tral Campus Recreation Building. It was someone 
who would quickly become one of my best friends 
and a crucial facet of my freshman year experience 
that was devastatingly altered just over a year ago by 
the ongoing pandemic. 

Despite the sad end to my time in Markley, the 

instances in which I felt lucky my freshman year 
are innumerable labyrinths of dominos. Upon cre-
ating my first-semester schedule, there were tons 
of freshman-level reading requirement courses that 
fit with my schedule, and I arbitrarily chose one. My 
Graduate Student Instructor for English 125 became 
the most influential person I have encountered at 
the University and impacted my thinking, writing 
and academic interests in ways I will never be able 
to fully articulate. During a required seminar for 
freshmen, I made one of my closest friends after mu-
tual laughter when a student started snoring on her 
shoulder. From singing karaoke in someone’s house 
near East Quad Residence Hall to airdropping pic-
tures of my dog to clueless diners in Mosher-Jordan 
Residence Hall, some of my best memories from my 
freshman year were made from spontaneous mo-
ments and last-minute plans with strangers.

Needless to say
, my time in Markley did not end 

as wonderfully as it began. Now, a year after students 
packed up their residence hall rooms and apartments 
during the onset of what would become the worst 
pandemic in a hundred years, I don’t feel as warm and 
fuzzy as I did sharing a twin XL with hallmates while 
binging Netflix or sitting under the indoor street lights 
of the Chemistry Building. In the mess of reflecting 
on the colorful moments, full of teary-eyed laughter, 
too many Mosher-Jordan cookies and feelings that if 
people are truly supposed to end up somewhere, that 
this is where I was supposed to be, I wonder how I 
came to be sitting here, hands on the keyboard. I won-
der how I was lucky enough to end up across the hall 
from Kat. I wonder how I ended up at the University. 
And all I see are dominos.

I know that these ponderings are arguably fu-

tile since I will never fully understand the way luck 
and my own have led me to my current circum-
stances of being a student at this University that 
has allowed me to feel lucky about my hallmates or 
my remarkable English 125 GSI. I will never know 
whether I would have been admitted to the Univer-
sity if I hadn’t been glued to a book after school every 
day from first through fifth grade or if I had taken 
one less SAT exam practice test. I will never know 
whether I would have ever been in such a position 
to read after school, let alone exist, if my mom had 
not spent every day after elementary school working 
on her family farm and cooking for a family of eight. 
I’ll never be able to distinguish the extent of my re-
sponsibility for my present circumstances, in part 
because luck and free will interact to create reality. 
I had no control over being born, nevertheless into 
a family that raised me to be able to apply and enroll 
at the University. But I chose to read every day after 
school. I had no control over growing up in Michigan 
with one of the best public universities in the world 
in my backyard. But I took the Advanced Placement 
classes, served on student Senate and applied — and 
luckily, my application resonated enough to set off 
the next domino of my enrollment. The unfath-
omable fragility and intricacy of our circumstances 
leave us with much uncertainty, yet we are curious to 
explore, understand and, in some ways, control the 
intersections of how the universe acts and how we 
act in the universe that create reality as we know it.

Within the quandaries of free will and fate, it 

seems that our lives are a product of the two — are 
we either absolutely powerful or powerless over 
our ability to make decisions and influence our cir-
cumstances? Be it fate, physics, some higher power 
or some combination of all three, our lives are lab-
yrinths of dominos, a line of paths converging and 
diverging, twisting into roundabouts and dead ends, 
falling into mountains of obstacles and sharp turns. 
The paths of our lives are not mazes, but reflecting 
on the reality that reality is a product of what we con-
trol and all that we cannot make us feel as though we 
are lost in one. I do not think we will ever fully un-
derstand how the dominos are positioned or appor-
tioned or why they fall the way they do. Now more 
than ever, I am overwhelmed and exhausted by this 
notion. But despite being unable to fathom exactly 
how reality comes to be, how I have come to be sit-
ting here, in this exact moment, writing this, I cannot 
entertain the idea of dismissing our role in creating 
our circumstances and contributing to the state of 
our world by believing that “it is what it is” or even 
worse, that “everything happens for a reason.”

This is not to say that we ought to constantly 

consider the profound mechanics of the product 
of fate and will. Whatever led me to laugh on the 
fourth floor of Markley on Thursday nights and 
sing Van Morrison’s “Brown-Eyed Girl” to the 3 a.m. 
audiences of the Butler bathroom merits little spec-
ulation compared to the unpacking of events of the 
past year. The first is partially a product of my doing, 
and the latter is something that I have relatively little 
control over, though it has come to significantly alter 
my life. Nevertheless, contemplating both situations 
has led me to recognize the domino effect in each, 

created by the intricacies of chance and human de-
cision-making. The role of human decision-making 
in creating the current state of the world, regardless 
of the extent of the impact, asserts the importance of 
human agency. In many ways, society places a pre-
mium on human agency, for both better and worse. 
In the case of the pandemic, human agency has con-
tributed to the millions of lives lost to COVID-19 over 
the past year as it has simultaneously saved others. I 
am not sure where we draw the line between uni-
versal forces and will, but following guidelines and 
internalizing their impact in the realness of whether 
someone lives or dies bluntly indicates the impor-
tance of human agency despite uncertainty. 

Human agency is necessary to critically con-

sider when reflecting on how we came to this 
point, and furthermore when holding individuals 
accountable, writing the history books and learn-
ing lessons from this dark time such that we can 
create and hope for a better future. In light of the 
overwhelming uncertainty and confusion towards 
the origins of my own life experiences, I ultimately 
feel inclined towards the manta of controlling what 
we can control. In “Collateral Beauty,” Smith’s 
character says human decisions are influenced 
because we “long for love, we wish we had more 
time and we fear death,” while these elements si-
multaneously exist in and influence the universe as 

we experience it. While we are unable to fully con-
trol love, time or death, we value and honor their 
existence and influence on the decisions we make 
in spite of the uncertainty. Since realizing my sister 
will be moving across the country in the fall, I take 
every opportunity to see her before our paths spent 
together as children, and now as young adults, are 
about to diverge indefinitely. Seeing the toll of the 
pandemic on my friends and family as the death 
count rises leads me to send more letters, cards and 
voicemails to convey my love for the people in my 
life. 

We must revere and respect the role of human 

agency in the domino effect. We cannot dismiss the 
significance or undermine the complexity of how 
fate and humans will interact even if we can never 
understand it. I’ll never understand how I came to sit 
here or consider all the ways I could be somewhere 
else doing something else at this exact moment in 
time. My hands on this keyboard and your eyes fol-
lowing these words are dominos profoundly placed 
by love, time and death, by luck and will to form re-
ality; through the twists and turns, highs and lows, 
waves and ripples, countless spirals and tendrils set 
throughout the journey of life, we accept the domi-
no effect for what it is, our reality, and do our best to 
make it one of profound and bold purpose, meaning 
and collateral beauty.
