FEDER AL FUNDING
The Arb
receives
funding
'U' secures national
Museums for
America funds
By AUSTIN WORDELL
Daily StaffReporter
As part of a national effort to
enhance natural resources and pro-
mote environmental sustainabil-
ity efforts, the federal government
recently granted funding to Ann
Arbor's Matthaei Botanical Gar-
dens and Nichols Arboretum to help
maintain North America's largest
collection of heirloom peonies.
U.S Senator Carl Levin (D-
Mich.) announced in a July 26 press
statement that the Botanical Gar-
dens and Nichols Arboretum are
among five Michigan museums that
will receive federal grants through
the Museums for America program
to preserve local establishments.
"Michigan's Museums are
home to many important state and
national treasures, and these grants
will help share those resources with
more visitors," Levin said in the
release. "I am proud these muse-
ums were selected out of scores of
applicants nationwide, reflecting
the great work being performed by
these institutions."
According to the press release,
the University will receive $79,658
from the Museums for America
grantas well as matching funds pro-
vided by the grantee to be used on
the "Peony Initiative," which will
provide information on the Internet

STUDYING ABROAD
GIEU cancels trip in El
Salvador after mnuggi ng

'U' mandates
participants return
to the United States
following incident
By SARAH ALSADEN
Daily NewsEditor
The University's Global
Intercultural Experience for
Undergraduates program can-
celed an internship program
based in El Salvador and required
students to return to the United

States after three students were
robbed at gunpoint on July 29 in
the city of San Salvador.
Though none of the students
were injured, the University
required the 14 students and two
faculty leaders to leave the coun-
try because the criminal activity
was suspected to be specifically
targeting the local agency the
students were working with,
according to University spokes-
man Rick Fitzgerald.
"We're very concerned about
the level of criminal activity in
the area and the fact that the
robbers actually took their pass-

ports, had access to their itiner-
ary and knew where they were
going to be," Fitzgerald said.
Fitzgerald said the Univer-
sity could not allow students to
remain in the country because of
the risk presented in continuing
the trip and the responsibility
the University had for the stu-
dents' safety.
"We were very concerned
and wanted to make sure that
our students were safe at all
times, and we felt it was impera-
tive that they return and get out
of that unsafe situation," Fitzger-

'U' offers camp for disadvantaged students

Program encourages
local middle school
students to learn in
a hands-on way
By JESSICA TREPKA
For the Daily
InnoWorks - a science sum-
mer camp program held at the
University and other schools
around the nation for socioeco-
nomically-disadvantaged middle
school students - will embark
upon its fourth year at the Uni-
versity in the quest to enrich the
minds of local youths when it
opens camp at the end of August.
With the philosophy of "by
students, for students," college
volunteers organize a week long
camp of activities and experi-
ments using resources offered by
the University to teach real-world
applications of science and engi-
neering, according to the United
InnoWorks Academy website.

This year, the camp will be com-
posed of Whitmore Lake Middle
School students and be held from
Aug. 22 to Aug. 26.
According to Jon Gold, an
engineering senior who works as
director of administration for the
camp, the program focuses on a
different school in the Ann Arbor
area each year, and students who
qualify for reduced lunches at
that school are eligible to apply
by expressing why they feel they
should be chosen to attend the
free summer camp.
Gold said that while the pro-
gram receives many applications,
only 30 students are accepted,
adding that the admissions pro-
cess aims to take into account
more than just academic achieve-
ment and "is not all about grades."
"We are really looking for
students with a natural desire to
learn and get better," Gold said.
He added his favorite part of
the camp is seeing students con-
tinually grow throughout the
week and gain confidence.
"As the week goes on, a lot of

the shy students would learn how
to take charge for projects," Gold
said. "Once they came up with
great ideas and started working
together, you could see on their
face the realization that they real-
ly have something to contribute."
Valerie Zeer, an LSA sopho-
more and the camp's curriculum
co-director, said the InnoWorks
program is unique because the
camp takes the students out of the
classroom and branches out from
traditional learning by providing
them with opportunities to learn
about science using hands-on
activities.
Zeer said her personal inter-
est in studying neuroscience first
stemmed from a former science
teacher who performed experi-
ments with the students after
every lesson.
"Originally, I absolutely hated
science," Zeer said. "I thought it
was boring. I always said making
science hands-on was the way I
had my interest sparked in sci-
ence."
Marjani Greene, a tenth-grade

student who participated in the
camp last year, said her favorite
part of the camp was the germ lab.
"It was interesting because I
got to see how many germs there
really are," Greene said.
She added the camp inspired
her to pursue a career in foren-
sics.
"I decided to go into foren-
sits because I really like problem
solving," Greene said. "I learned a
lot about problem solving at Inno-
Works. The camp made me enjoy
it more. I was able to sit down and
investigate."
Nikhil Iyer, an LSA junior and
statistics and executive direc-
tor of the program, said campers
work closely with their college
mentors in finding a possible
career path in a science-related
field.
"The camp inspires them
to learn more about careers of
research in science," Iyer said.
"They work with their mentors
and see how cool it is to do sci-
ence. It's possible to have fun
doing science."

The Onion to begin A2 coverage this fall

Distributor says
satirical paper will
appeal to University
students
By MARISA WINTER
For the Daily
In addition to campus humor
publications The Every Three
Weekly and The Gargoyle, stu-
dents will soon have the opportu-
nity to leaf through the pages of
the nationally renowned satirical
paper The Onion as it begins dis-
tribution in the city of Ann Arbor
this fall.
Founded in Madison, Wiscon-
sin in the 1980s, The Onion is a
humorous news source that covers
local, national and international
issues, as well as entertainment
news in its non-satirical section
called The A.V. Club. University
alum Bobby Mitchell said he plans
to distribute The Onion with the

help of his Chicago-based distri-
bution company - Bopper Media
Inc. - adding he decided to bring
the paper to Ann Arbor because he
thinks the town has an audience
that will appreciate its humor.
"Ann Arbor has the most per-
fect market for The Onion based
on where it is now, the people who
read it and the community as a
whole," Mitchell said.
Living and working in Chica-
go, Mitchell said he was exited to
bring an office to Ann Arbor that
would cover local and national
news, adding he would eventually
like to distribute to Ypsilanti and
the greater Detroit area.
The Onion is currently dis-
tributed in fourteen cities across
the country and is continuing to
expand. Mitchell said the similari-
ties between the founding city of
Madison and Ann Arbor make it
an easy choice as a new venture for
the publication.
"There are a lot of similarities
between Madison and Ann Arbor
- they are both college towns and

the people must be relatively intel-
ligent to understand the humor,"
he said.
Bopper Media Inc. will print
and distribute the paper, which
will provide local stories and
humor that will be featured in the
entertainment section. Mitchell
said circulating the newspaper in
new places like Ann Arbor brings a
fresh, new comedic side of print to
the hands of the masses.
Carrie Palmer, director of
franchising for The Onion, said
their roots are in print media and
they have been long anticipating
distribution to Ann Arbor resi-
dents.
"Ann Arbor is a perfect fit,"
Palmer said. "We always wanted
to be in Ann Arbor - a great col-
lege town and a fantastic commu-
nity."
Palmer added she believes
the paper is expected to receive
a warm welcome by the educated.
and sophisticated Michigan stu-
dents and surrounding residents
who will appreciate its humor.

"The young, educated and
soon-to-be affluentdemographic...
is smart enough to get our humor,"
she said. "This demographic, both
on and off campus, fits our brand
perfectly. We are extremely excit-
ed to finally bring our paper here."
Through the partnership with
Bopper Media Inc., the satirical
news source will distribute 20,000
papers weekly starting after Labor
Day weekend, Palmer said.
Anne Finn, public relations
manager for The Onion, echoed
the sentiments of Mitchell and
Palmer that it is important for
their publication to expand and
that Ann Arbor seemed to be a
natural fit.
"The Onion's ongoing print
expansion is a testament to our
content," Finn said. "Over the last
year, we've introduced the news-
paper to new markets through-
out the U.S. as well as in Toronto,
Canada. Finding the right partner
is always key, and we are thrilled
to now have a presence in Ann
Arbor."

Tattoo shop sees success in first months of business

Authentic Art
provides the city
with a clean and
unique alternative
By MARISA WINTER
For the Daily
Since Authentic Art Tat-
too Studio first opened in April,
owner Jordan Epstein has strived
for his costumer-friendly, single-
artist tattoo shop at 527 East Lib-
erty Street to serve as a fresh and
original outlook on an ancient art
form.
Epstein said his promise to
put the people before the competi-
tion in Ann Arbor with his 1,000
square-foot shop has proven suc-
cessful thus far in his first few
months of business.
Born and raised in Ann Arbor,
Epstein said he gives a warm wel-
come to his neighborhood clien-
tele and invites potential clients
to focus on specialty artwork and
the "innovative and cleaner feel"
that his shop offers.
"Most say that my shop looks
different than most," Epstein said.
"We go for a different feel and a
different look. It's not your aver-
age tattoo shop."
- Inspired by a Floridian tat-
too shop, Epstein created a parlor
without "flash" - popular prints
put up on the walls by artists to
serve as references or provide tat-
too ideas - giving the shop a more

inviting ambiance and cleaner
appearance.
"I've visited many different
shops throughout our country and
internationally, with many vari-
ous layouts and artists," Epstein
said."But I've committed to keep-
ing a solid focus on customer
interaction and goal to provide a
higher }standard in customer ser-
vice."
Epstein added he plans on hir-
ing more artists but wants to stay
true to his views and practices of
personalization so his shop can
build lasting relationships and
create custom pieces for his cus-
tomers.
According to Epstein, his cur-
rent artist Cory Torrans - who
has sixteen years of experience
and has won multiple awards for
his work - will help build the
shop's clientele.
"Corey consistently performs
with quality, specialty work,"
Epstein said. "Because of that, he
has loyal clients."
As far as competition, Epstein
said he recommends people find a
shop that best fits them and their
needs, even if it isn't Authentic
Art.
"Look around and see what
you like, check it out, and see if
you like what you see and the feel-
ing you get - and that says it all,"
he said.
Epstein said he opened his
store in Ann Arbor due to the
demand he had seen in the area
for a tattoo parlor similar to his,
adding that he has branded his

business as one that focuses on
customer feedback.
"Feedback - that's what sets
us apart," Epstein said. "We are
different from what people are
used to. We are dedicated to our
customers. The point is not to
point out different shops, just start
our own and do what we want to
do. Those able to start businesses
in the tattooing community run
things differently. There's no need
to conform or ask for permission
to be who we are."
Leo Zulueta, owner of Spi-
ral Tattoo on Packard Road, said
cleanliness is instrumental in
attracting customers, and is some-
thing Authentic Art has ensured
to be a priorityworks on a tattoo design at Authentic Art Studio on ACH ROSS/t i1 y
"I've been in the business 30
years," Zulueta said. "It is impor-
tant that most parlors are clean to
serve public." Mention This AD

Leave loans alone
Congress shouldn't cut education subsidies
The debt deal was bound to have its fair share of pitfalls.
The last minute wrangling between Democrats and
Republicans was not a compromise, but rather a messy,
last-ditch effort to avoid a disastrous default. Failing to reach
any kind of appropriate or reasonable spending cuts, the coun-
try now has to deal with the mistakes of Congress, the biggest
of which is the halting of the government's subsidy on Direct
Subsidized Federal Loans. Starting July 1, 2012, the loan pro-
gram, which provides loans to graduate and professional stu-
dents, will be phased out, leaving many students scrambling to
finance their education. In order to ensure that the U.S. main-
tains a well-educated population, the Direct Subsidized Federal
Loans must be reinstated.

The other day I called Comcast to
fix my Internet. After 45 minutes on
hold, I was greeted by a woman with
a Southern accent _
tinted with the
familiar customer
service industry's
"anything for you
(because you are
paying me)" enthu-
siasm. Within sec-
onds it was clear JONATHAN
something was AYLWARD
awry; interspersed
with this woman's
Southern service
charm were extremely awkward
phrases and totally bizarre inflec-
tions. Baffled and trying hard to
suppress my laughter, I respectfully
asked where this woman (I'll call her
Mary) was working from. Indonesia.
Aha! She was faking it.
I embrace my inner grumpy old
man when I say - what the hell
happened to America?
Over 10 percent of our nation
is unemployed, and this woman is
employed by a U.S. company doing
something that an American would
almost assuredly do better. I didn't
mention that the Mary offered subpar
help - I had to repeat most things I
said, and she had to pass meonto adif-
ferent department for help. As a tem-
porary cranky old white man I felt an
impulse to blame illegal immigrants
for all of our problems. Remembering
the Comcast situation that incited my
anger, I was brought back to reality.
Illegal immigrants are definitely not
the ones running Comcast and out-
sourcingjobs to Indonesia.
' The people responsible for that
would be the management at Com-
cast. But can we really blame them?
Their job is to maximize profit for
their shareholders. If they can get
away with paying workers in Indone-
sia with fake Southern accents, why
bother paying for the real thing?
With no one readily available to
pin the blame on, let's return to the
accent.'As trivial as it seems, this
farce hid something important.
Clearly Comcast's customers
would ideally like to interact with
other English speakers, preferably
an easy to understand American - if
not, why train Mary to speak in such a
way? Comcast's management knows
that Americans don't take kindly
knowing that these jobs are being
shipped overseas. It doesn't seem
like a stretch to say that by equipping
Mary with a semi-passable Southern
accent, Comcast is hoping to dupe
us into thinking they are employing
Americans.

Possibly even more depressing
than this pathetic attempt at decep-
tion was how well Mary grasped the
lifeless, tired inflections of the Amer-
ican service industry. David Foster
Wallace -described the debilitating
psychological effects of the "profes-
sional smile" and how it was a bane to
both customers and employees. This
should be the last thing we spread
around the world.
Bumper stickers everywhere pro-
claim "Buy American." What a bril-
liant way to shift the blame away from
those that truly affect the economy. A
more thoughtful attempt at bumper
politics would read "Employ Ameri-
can." It isn't too hard to see where the
jobs have gone.
"Employ
American," not
"Buy American."
The world is filled with incredi-
bly cheap labor for American corpo-
rations to tap into. Ifacompanygets
large enough and wants to expand,
it will move its production out of the
U.S. When people from one place
start demanding high wages, there
are always poorer people to turn to.
You don't have to take my word for
it - look around you. Detroit was
once a bustling industrial center;
now one in five people in the city
are out of work. The workforce of
the U.S. simply can't compete for
unskilled labor jobs that can be
exported to developing countries.
I'd hoped that this article was
going to be a diatribe against the
global capitalist system and the neo-
liberal policies that take first world
company's jobs and move them
to the lowest bidders in the third
world, ensuring that everybody loses.
Instead, with space at a serious limit
and my deadline fast approaching, I'll
direct it towards Comcast.
The website consumerist.com, a
consumer affairs blog that gauges
customer feedback, voted Comcast
the worst company in America in
2010. From my experiences over the
years, that sounds about right. The
CEO of Comcast makes 31.1 million
dollars per year. He is also a heck of
a squash player. He probably deserves
to be punched in the face.

WILL GRUNDLER WI
Bigger than Jesus

JEFF ZUSCHLAG

E-MAIL JEFFAT JEFFDZ@UMICH.EDU

My sister is the smartest girl I
know, but even she continues to
read "Harry Potter" long after the
series has anything meaningful to
say about life as she knows it. It's
in this way that Harry Potter is
like the Bible, yet a good number
of people my age question or even
mock the divinity of Jesus while
insisting, loudly and with passion,
that the books about the boy wiz-
ard are the real Gospels, the books
to read if you had but one choice.
I'm not exaggerating. Who do
you think wrote the following?
"At page 699 of 'Harry Potter
and the Deathly Hallows,' I had
to put down the book. My face
was already soaked with tears,
my body convulsing with hys-
terical sobs, but on page 699, I
had to drop everything and run
to the bathroom because I was
sure I was going to be sick." The
author, whose convulsions and
upset stomach are due presum-
ably to the emotionally traumatic
effects of the story and not, say,
food poisoning, is a senior arts
editor at this publication (Saying
goodbye to a 'Harry Potter' child-
hood, 7/4/11.) Just like religion,
the Harry Potter affliction doesn't
spare the educated.
But why this obsession? Why
does my sister reread and reread
and reread the series as if she's
studying for a Hogwarts Place-
ment Exam? Why do senior arts
editors convulse and sob and suf-
fer as if possessed by He Who
Must Not Be Named?
Because the books tell a fairly
compelling story. Not a highly
original or perfect story unblem-
ished by cliches or plotholes, but an
exciting one that's easy to devour,
easy to fall in love with, easy to
consume. I remember our family
purchasing a copy of "Harry Pot-
ter and the Goblet of Fire" and my
ten year-old self finishing the 734-
page book in one day. Oh, it was
easy. It was fun. But it didn't really
matter. I could read 700 pages of
"Harry Potter" and then get back
to the books that were relevant,
like the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy" series. I could get back to
reading stories that actually spoke
to me about that incurable ailment
- the human condition - rather
than stories about a good boy bat-
tling an evil wizard.
I can almost hear the indig-
nant snorts and see the eyes roll

back. I can almost sense the pulses
quicken as the believers stew with
righteous anger. What about the
themes of love and loss, they cry!
What about doing what's right in
the face of insurmountable odds?
Did we not grow up with this boy?
Are we not,in the words ofthe pre-
viously quoted author, "the 'Harry
Potter' generation, the grade-
schoolers who are starting to head
out into the real world with the
comfort of Hogwarts tucked away
inside our minds?"
I used to fight against the idea
that the Harry Potter series was
the literature of my generation
with all the fury of an English
teacher whose class insists that
the period is an unnecessary
punctuation mark. How offensive,
I thought, to declare the late nine-
ties and the aughts as belonging to
Harry Potter - to actually suggest
that the books had anything to do
with the real issues going on in our
adolescence, our country and our
world. How repulsive were those
who declared that Harry Potter
was alongside us the whole way,
how oddly subservient. How blind
and silly and stupid, to hold a fan-
tasy series with mundane themes
in the highest regard.
Yet in a perverse way, I suppose
they are the books of our genera-
tion. We know the magical and
the ordinary all too well. At the
same time that we revel in the
fantasy of Facebook, of seeing the
private lives of friends and new
acquaintances, we slowly realize
how depressingly bland statuses
are, how trite and boring our per-
sonal information is, how cliche
all our friends' favorite sayings
are. The effect of this technology
is to make a digital shrine to our
collective mediocrity. We live in
a world undreamt of just a few
generations ago and many of us
take advantage of it by staring at
useless information for hours. I
still have to explain the scale of
the universe to many of my peers
and I don't know if they even
care. Ours is the "Harry Potter"
generation to the extent that we
occupy so much of our time with
stuff that just doesn't matter, and
Harry, no matter how much we
enjoyed him growing up, belongs
in that category.

aboutthe garden's various peonies.
David Michener, associate cura-
tor at Matthaei Botanical Gardens
and Nichols Arboretum, said the
money will allow the University to
develop a better website to show-
case the nature preserves.
"Being able to move a lot of
information to the web will help us
serve our local constituency as well
as make it more available for people
coming from afar," Michener said.
"This is to help give us a template to
build a much richer website."
The money provided by the
Museums for America grants is
only one piece of the peony proj-
ect, which includes restoration and
expansion, among other improve-
ments,that are alreadyseveralyears
underway. According to Michener,
funding for other parts of the Peony
Initiative have come from private
foundations.

He added that applying for the
grant money involved answering
a detailed set of questions regard-
ing how the work would impact the
institution and be important for the
country. He said that for the peony
gardens, the importance comes
from the gardens' more than 270
varieties of historic peonies.
According to Scott Kunst -
founder of Ann Arbor's Old House
Gardens, a business that specializes
in historic plants - the Peony Gar-
den was donated to Nichols Arbore-
tum in 1922 by WE Upjohn, founder
of the Upjohn Pharmaceutical Com-
pany in Kalamazoo, Mich.
"He thought the Arboretum,
which was just being developed,
ought to have a showcase collection
of one of the most important flowers
of the age," Kunst said.
Kunst added he believes the
garden has lived up to the original
donor's vision and that the collec-
tion is unmatched.
For many, the peony has a
unique visual appeal that has made

it a popular and culturally sig-
nificant flower for decades, Kunst
explained.
"The peony is a lush, profuse
(and) abundant kind of luxuri-
ous flower ... people really respond
strongly to them," Kunst said. "They
were the stars of all the high-end
boutiques."
In addition to its aesthetic
appeal, its sturdy nature has made
the flower a favorite among collec-
tors and florists.
"It's sort of like a tree almost,
you plant a peony and there is a
good chance that it will be there a
hundred years later," Kunst said.
"They have been around for so long
that everybody remembers them
from when they grew up."
Five Michigan museums -
including the Michigan State Uni-
versity Museum,theDetroitScience
Center and the Arab-American
National Museums - were among
160 nationwide to receive Museum
for America grants for various pro-
grams.

MERC denies University GSRAs
unionization rights in Aug. 8 ruling

ald said.
He added that though there
are no plans to continue the pro-
gram in El Salvador, students
were reimbursed for the short-
ened trip and granted the oppor-
tunity for full academic credit
for the trip.
LSA senior Manish Patel,
who was part of the team that
travelled to El Salvador, wrote
in an e-mail interview that the
group was upset with the deci-
sion to end the trip.
"The decision that was made
was unacceptable, irrational, and
ignorant on behalf of the Univer-
sity," Patel wrote.
He added that after the Uni-
versity ultimately suspended the
trip, members of the team signed
waivers releasing the Univer-
sity from liability so they could
attempt to continue their stay in
El Salvador.
"It was hard to hear that
after a small robbery incident,
the University would go so far as
to suspend our trip," Patel wrote.
"Our team, devoted to solidar-
ity and intercultural experience,
decided to continue without Uni-
versity permission and affiliation
after suspension of the trip."
As part of their effort to
convince the University to let
them stay in El Salvador, Patel
wrote they had their itineraries
approved by the U.S. Embassy
and found two officers from the
tourism police to escort the stu-
dents throughout the rest of the
trip. Despite their added safety
precautions, the University
maintained the students should
return to the United States.
In addition to mandating the
students to return, Patel wrote
the University stated they would
not be allowed to enroll for fall
term if they did not come back to
the United States.
He added he believes Uni-
versity officials did not take into
account students' opinions in
making the decision for them to
return.
"We were forced to come
home without a voice which we
found to be disrespectful," he
wrote. "At this point, they took
away our voice and our choice."

However, Fitzgerald said
there was communication
between the two leaders and stu-
dents who were part of the team
in' El Salvador and University
officials, and regardless of the
students' desire to stay, the Uni-
versity strives to ensure safety of
its students at all times.
"The leadership in El Sal-
vador was well aware of the
student's concerns and feelings
- I know there were some pretty
strong feelings that they wanted
to stay in El Salvador," Fitzgerald
said. "The safety of our students
is our number one priority and
more fully assessing the situa-
tion in El Salvador again, LSA
leadership felt very strongly that
we need to bring these students
home."
Despite the liability waivers
and further efforts to remain in
the country, Fitzgerald said the
students were still on a Univer-
sity trip and therefore the Uni-
versity would still be liable if
anything were to happen.
"Essentially, they are there
on University-sponsored travel
and the University is respon-
sible for the safety of those stu-
dents," Fitzgerald said. "It's just
not practical to say we'll just
wash our hands of these students
and let them stay in El Salva-
dor on their own ... University .
leadership and the LSA leader-
ship assessing the situation and
the incident that happened felt
strongly it was in the best inter-
est of those students for the safe-
ty of those students to return to
the U.S."
Patel said that while the
trip was cut short, he still had
a transformative experience
and gained valuable experience
despite his frustrations with the
University.
"The people of El Salvador
are genuine, kind-hearted, and
would go the end of the earth to
accommodate us," Patel wrote.
"I met some amazing people and
heard some amazing things from
them that will always be with
me. I had an amazing time for
the one week I was there, but feel
ashamed that the University did
such a thing."

0 Decision upholds
1981 law that states
students do not have
right to unionize
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The Michigan Employment
Relations Commission ruled Mon-
day that since the University's
Graduate Student Research Assis-
tants are not considered public
employees, they will not be allowed
to unionize - ceasing a months-
longendeavor for the GSRAs to join
the Graduate Employees Organiza-
tion.
The decision - which upholds
precedent of the 1981 law that
ruled students are not public
employees and thus cannot union-
ize - amounted to be a deterrent
in GEO's ambitions to incorpo-
rate GSRAs. It was also a victory
for GSRA Melinda Day and the
Mackinac Center Legal Founda-
tion, which filed a motion on July
28 on Day's behalf in the hopes of
forestalling those objectives.
In response to MERC's deci-
sion, GEO President Sam Mont-

gomery said she maintains the
ruling will not end GEO's efforts to
unionize the GSRAs.
Montgomery said despite the
decision, the union would con-
tinue to pursue negotiations with
the University on the terms of
an election that could determine
whether GSRAs would join the
union. Those negotiations began in
May, after the University's Board of
Regents voted 6-2 against Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
to give GSRAs collective bargain-
ing rights.
"It seems like it's an adminis-
trative hurdle," Montgomery said.
"It's something that we're hoping
to have appealed and something
that won't prevent us from working
towards an election ... This will not
deter us in that aim."
She added her optimism stems
from the wishes of GSRAs to gain
better working conditions, access
to equipment and better health
benefits - "all the things ... that
come with being full members of
a union," she said. Her's and the
GEO's interpretations of the ruling,
however,held that the organization
could proceed with its negotiations
with the University and eventually
have an election.
In an Aug. 8 statement, Patrick

Wright, director of the Mackinac
Center Legal Foundation, praised
MERC's decision as a "victory for
the rule of law."
"MERC enforced the law, rath-
er than allowinga politically divid-
ed (University's) Board of Regents
to bypass it through a hasty reso-
lution," Wright said in the state-
ment. "This resolution called for a
public employee union election for
a group of students who weren't
public employees in the first place.
The regents have no legal authority
to expand the statutory definition
of public employees."
Wright and the Mackinac Cen-
ter Legal Foundation filed a motion
hoping to prevent the GEO's move
to unionize on July 28, according
to a July 28 article in The Michigan
Daily. At that time, Day, the GSRA
on whose behalf the Foundation
filed the motion, said in a state-
ment the regulations that union-
ization would instate would prove
unworkable.
"It would hinder our ability to
do science," Day said in the July 28
statement. "I recently completed
an experiment that involved tak-
ing samples every eight hours. I
wouldn't have been able to do that
under the strict work-hour regula-
tions the GEO wants."

Lollapalooza: The beat goes on.
Twentieth-anniversary festival rocks despite
the rain with its stellar headlinersE
By Elliot Alpern I Daily Arts Writer .m

CHICAGO - The rain came
down in sheets over the cityscape
of Chicago on a hot Sunday night,
and at its center, hundreds of thou-
sands of wet, tired people danced
Grant Park's spacious fields into a
thick mud. The Foo Fighters' Dave
Grohl led a massive audience in
singing "My Hero" on one end of
the parkland and a human ocean
swayed to deadmauS's reverber-
ating beats on the other. This was
the finale to Lollapalooza's 20th
anniversary.
The eldest of the three major
American summer music festivals
(the others being Coachella and
Bonnaroo), Lollapalooza has had
a long and storied history, boast-
ing such recording giants as Pearl
Jam, Green Day, and the Red Hot
Chili Peppers in the past, to name
a select few.
"In 1991, I expected about 10 to
20,000 weirdos," said founder and
Jane's Addiction lead singer Perry
Farrell at an opening day press
conference. "Now I'm proud to say
we have 90,000 weirdos!"
And this year, those weirdos
came out in staggering numbers to
behold a slightly humdrum collec-
tion of headliners: Coldolay, Muse,

the Foo Fighters and Eminem. But
if that tandem of names did noth-
ing to excite, their sets sure did.
On day one, Coldplay and Muse
competed to draw fans as the coin-
ciding acts of the night, and did not
disappoint those who made either
choice. Coldplay's Chris Martin
offered a tribute to the late Amy
Winehouse, and debuted a hand-
ful of new songs from the band's
upcoming album. Those that
decided to see the rock trio Muse
bore witness to a spectacular show
of effects, complete with lights,
lasers, columns of smoke and even
fireworks that echoed through the
skyscrapers of Chicago.
Eminem ruled the night on day
two, baitingthe audience with sur-
prise guests Bruno Mars, Skylar
Grey, and Royce da 5'9" in a fren-
zied but powerful performance.
The packed concert grounds con-
trasted with the rather undersized
turnout for My Morning Jacket,
which still proved to be worth-
while for fans of its wandering
psychedelic rock and blissful jams.
Those lucky enough to buy
three-day passes or Sunday tick-
ets were treated to what will likely
be an oft-remembered experience,

COURTESY OF DAVE MEAD FOR LOLLAPALOOZA

Muse plays a Friday set to festivalgoers.
regardless of whom they went
to see that night. The rain front
that had delayed the Arctic Mon-
keys for the better half of an hour
did nothing to dissuade the fea-
tured events that were Foo Fight-
ers and deadmau5, each of which
drew immense crowds despite
the temperamental climate. The
latter mix-master sat atop a mas-
sive cubic throne and subjected
his congregation to a unison of
deafening beats and blinding
lights despite technical issues that
afflicted some of the effects. Noth-
ing, though, could bring the festi-
val to a close better than a surprise
appearance by - the founder him-
self - Perry Farrell, who gave his
spectators a hearty goodnight as
the Foos rounded out their exten-
sive and dynamic set-list with the
always popular "Everlong."
However, as any seasoned fes-
tival-goer will tell you, the head-
liners don't make the show. The
established big (but not biggest)
names along with the budding up-
and-comers constitute the meat
and potatoes of the festivities,
and through these offerings, Lol-
lapalooza shined brilliantly this
year.
Due to favorably scheduled
matchups (which can conversely
destroy crowds at multiple stages),
day one saw several bands draw
considerably larger turnouts than
they were used to.

COURTESY OF STAR TRIBUNE
"Because we are living in a material world.
Golden rap duo prevails

BY DAVID RIVA
DailyArts Writer
There are so many blogworthy sto-
rylines behind Watch the Throne, it's
hard to keep track:
Its organic devel-
opment from an
EP to a full length;
the lack of leaks Watchthe
and secrecy kept Throne
from inception to
its ever-changing Jay-Z and
release date; the Kanye West
iTunes and Best Roc Nation
Buy exclusives that
prompted an angry
letter by independent record stores;
the big-brother and proteg6 narra-
tives. All these components have made
Watch the Throne one of the most
anticipated releases in recent memory.
But at the end of the day, none of this
buzz really matters. One plain and
simple fact should remain the most
important: Watch the Throne features
two rap giants collaborating for 12
tracks. And any fan of music should be
thrilled by the potential outcome.
Opener "No Church in the Wild"
lays down a tribal, pulsating beat - a
typical trait of recent Kanye produc-
tions. The ensuing lyrical assault,
however, is wider in scope than any-
one ever could have expected. Frank
Ocean takes the hook, outlining the
hierarchy from human to Higher
Power, but begs the question of wheth-
er or not that chain of command mat-
ters in a chaotic world. Jay-Z responds
in the first verse by blending religious
and philosophical references to con-
clude that the teachings of the proph-
ets known as Yeezy and Hova stand as
equal to - or perhaps superior to - any
belief or opinion. This hip-hop boast
isn't anything new - especially for the
opening track to a Jay-Z album - but
with a reference to Plato's Euthyphro,
this is as academic as a rap can get. For

an album that couldn't have any high-
er expectations, the first track packs
a mind-boggling, disorienting punch.
This isn't feel-good, shut-off-your-
mind-and-enjoy kind of music. This is
heavy stuff.
But after the intellectually loaded
first track terminates, a weight is lift-
ed and the fluffy "Lift Off" does quite
literally what its title suggests. Beyon-
c6's perfectly pitched voice soars for a
radio-ready chorus as light and airy as
"Church"washeavy. Completelyvapid
of lyrical complexity compared to its
predecessor, the track squeezes in all
the tropes of a mediocre club track -
brief yet frenetic drum machine, ran-
domly injected background shouts
and, of course, heavy bass throughout.
"Lift Off," however, is the rare
exception in an exceptionally brainy
album. "New Day" contains Kanye's
most direct address of his past trans-
gressions to date. While "Runaway"
was just a superficial skirting of the
I'mma-let-you-finish debacle, Kanye
finally faces his demons head-on in
song form. The "George Bush hates
black people" statement after Hurri-
cane Katrina, his rocky relationship
with ex-girlfriend Alexis Phifer, his
mother's death at the hands of an ill-
advised plastic surgery operation and,
his infamously stubborn personality -
it's all here.
Kanye's reflection on these events,
however, has a larger function. Kanye
and Jay-Z have their potential off-
spring on the mind. Their feelings
are similarly sympathetic for sons
who will never carry out a normal life
because of the fame of their fathers.
The track is slightly tainted by an ill-
advised, auto-tuned sample of the
Nina Simone classic "Feeling Good."
But the lyrical exchange between the
two wannabe future fathers- sounds
like a deep and heartfelt conversa-
tion among a pair of personalities that
truly understand each other.

In fact, the chance that "New Day"
actually stemmed from an in-person
dialogue is increased by the nature
of Watch the Throne's recording.
According to Jay-Z, in an interview
with The Rolling Stone, both artists
were present in the same location
during the entire recording process -
an impressive feat considering their
globe-trotting tendencies and packed
work schedules. The resultant chem-
istry can be felt on tracks like "Why I
Love You" and "Gotta Have It," which
feature trade-off vocals bouncing off
one another as if they're finishing one
another's thoughts.
"Otis" is perhaps the best display of
this ping-pong-ing and is a clear album
standout. Named for the track's sam-
ple (Otis Redding's "Try A Little Ten-
derness"), "Otis" is a throwback not
only because it features a song from
the '60s, but it also recalls Jay-Z and
Kanye's earliest collaborations, which
used old soul and Motown samples.
This time around, Kanye decides to
maintain an authentic feel. Redding's
completely unadulterated vocal prow-
ess shines and is matched by a simi-
larly scrappy approach to the song's
verses.
Throughout Watch the Throne,
Kanye and Jay-Z seem to constantly
be on the same page. Every line is
mutually understood and every verse
is complemented by the other. The
purpose of the album's title is assumed
to be another one of those hip-hop
boasts - Jay-Z and Kanye West are
the kings of the rap game. The obvious
question of "How many seats does this
throne have?" posed before listening
to the album is clearly resolved by its
end. The pair claim the top two spots
of rap royalty. And unlike many simi-
larly ego-driven claims by their peers,
Jay-Z and Kanye are probably right.
Watch the Throne is just one of many
examples of how they defend their
unmatched sovereignty.

Borges won't bottle up Robinson's running ability,

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
It's what every Michigan fan
has known since Denard Robinson
botched his first snap as a freshman
and practically trotted through the
Western Michigan defense for a
touchdown.
Michigan offensive coordinator
Al Borges just reaffirmed it.
Denard is deadly.
"With the ball under his arm,
anything can happen," Borges told
the media Wednesday. "If you're
going to hook slide him premature-
ly, when he could juke a guy-"
Borges paused.
"You coach Denard differ-
ent than you coach (San Diego
State quarterback) Ryan Lindley.
They're different players."
It's safe to say that opposing
defenses can still expect a heavy
dose of Robinson, even under
Borges' pro-style offense. But it's
not going to be quite so heavy.
Robinson led the Wolverines
in 2010 with 1,702 rushing yards.
But it took 256 carries to reach
that mark - an average of nearly
20 attempts per game. And that's a
number Borges aims to shrink.
Borges wouldn't commit to a
number of carries he'd like Robin-

son to have, but said, "It's gonna be
less."
"As a play caller, you go into
games with a plan, but then all of
the sudden things change and they
can't stop (Robinson),"-Borges said.
"Now, I was born at night, but I
wasn't born last night. Call his
number, give him a chance, but try
not to beat him up."
And, as always, he just has one
piece of advice for his junior quar-
terback.
"Make plays, don't make mira'
cles," Borges said.
Borges won't be reinventing the
wheel to tailor his offense to fit
Robinson's unique skill set. But it
won't be old hat, either.
"A lot of the stuff you're going
to see, you'll say, 'Oh, I've seen that
before,"' Borges said. "But because
we're going to a power-run style,
we're trying to take some of the
burden off him as a runner - and
more than anything keep him in
one piece. Because the one thing
that jumped out at me as I stud-
ied tape from last year is (Michi-
gan was) a different team when he
wasn't in there." .
To ease the strain on Robinson's
legs, Michigan is committed to
featuring the running backs early,
and often in the first season under

Borges and Michigan coach Brady
Hoke.
Borges intends to cut the race
at tailback down from a handful of
backs to two or three in the near
future. Although he'd name the
starter "yesterday if we could," the
offensive coordinator gave no indi-
cation as to the front-runners in
the backfield.
"Nobody's been tackled yet, so
you can't tell anything yet," Borges
said.
When asked to list his criteria
for a leading candidate at tailback,
Borges's response sounded remi-
niscent of former running back
Mike Hart and some of Michigan's
all-time best backs.
It's not about the size.
"The ability to win in the open
field, break tackles, make people
miss, understand our protection
scheme," Borges said were vital
pieces. "Receiving skills are a part
of it, too - it's not at the top of the
list, but it's part of it.
"It's a vision position. As long
as you give them an opportunity
to see the cuts, they can make the
cuts easily."
At 5-foot-6, junior Vincent Smith
has been tabbed as a strong con-
tender for duties at running back,
but is jockeying for the No. 1 job

Junior quarterback Denard Robinson won't be seeing 20 carries pergame in 2011.

alongside redshirt junior Michael
Cox and senior Michael Shaw.
Borges referred to burly soph-
omore Stephen Hopkins as a
"hybrid" back, and possibly a third-
down threat.
But even with the seemingly
tight race in the backfield with just
over three weeks remaining, Borg-
es doesn't plan to rotate running
backs once Sept. 3 rolls around.
"I don't like rotating guys,"
Borges said. "But that being said, if

two guys are on an equal plane we
may do it. Never say never, but it's
never been my preference."
But, for now, the running backs
are looking to the man at the pin-
nacle of the nation's running game
- No. 16. And Borges wouldn't
mind some Robinson-like runs
from his tailbacks.
"(We want) a guy we feel ... can
give us some of the same things
Denard gave us last year and he'll
give us this year," Borges said.

Michigan defense focusing on effort, technique in camp

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan defensive coordinator
Greg Mattison thinks Bo Schem-
bechler would be beaming.
"I think he'd be smiling like crazy
right now," Mattison said after
practice on Tuesday, seated inside
Schembechler Hall for a press con-
ference.
Mattison was responding after
being asked how he thought Schem-
bechler, Michigan's late head coach,
would react to knowing Michigan
football coach Brady Hoke is now at
the helm.
But when it comes to his defense,
Mattison aims to do more than just
make Schembechler happy.
"Our mission here is to get play-
ers that make -the University of
Michigan proud," Mattison said.
And Mattison believes that he
has the players to make that hap-
pen. Though the Wolverines have
only had two days of practice thus
far, Mattison was pleased with

what he's seen.
"I'm really, really impressed
and excited about the effort of our
guys," Mattison said. "I think you
saw it starting in the summer. I
think you saw these guys trying to
do the right thing, trying to improve
themselves, and then it just carries
over when they started practice.
"We've got miles and miles to go
to get where we want to be, but as
far as their preparation right now,
I'm very, very excited about it."
Despite the improvements of his
players, Mattison said there's a long
way to go before he finalizes start-
ers for each position. He mentioned
several times that each starting job
is up for grabs and claimed the best
11 players will be the ones on the
field.
Mattison said he is looking
toward the future and cares very
little about last year's disastrous
season and which players held what
positions in 2010 - a season when
Michigan finished 110th in the
nation in total defense.

Instead he chooses to focus on
what he can do to get Michigan
back on track for the upcoming sea-
son, adding he only watched a small
amount of tape on last season's
defensive squad - including parts
of the Notre Dame, Michigan State
and Wisconsin games - because he
opts not to dwell on the past.
While he didn't give any names,
Mattison mentioned that some
players may change positions
throughout camp.
But the coordinator, in his first
year back with the Wolverines after
coaching in Ann Arbor from 1992 to
1996, had high praise for this year's
linebacker core.
"This group of linebackers, I
would say they probably day to day
have improved more than any other
position," Mattison said. "Now the
thing we gotta find out is, is that
because they weren't very talented
and they're really going now, or
is it because they're really, really
improving?
"I happen to think it's because

they're really improving."
He's going to have a tough time
deciding who should start, as he
said most of the linebackers have
similar skill levels, but when look-
ing at the front seven in general, the
task is easy.
"The whole thing is gonna come
down to two things," Mattison said.
"Playing with great technique and
playing with great effort."
Mattison echoed that same phi-
losophy when talking about his
defense as a whole - a defense that
hasn't developed an identity quite
yet.
"I can't say right now that we're
a blitz team, I can't say that we're
gonna be a coverage team," Matti-
son said. "The onlything I can say is
we're gonna play with unbelievable
effort. The thing I hope we can say
after this camp is over with is that
this team is gonna play with great
technique."
And though Mattison said he
doesn't know 'exactly how his
defense will materialize, he has a

vision for what he wants it to be.
"I want to be a team that nobody
can run the football on, first of all,"
he said. "I want a defense that is
aggressive."
He wants the opposing team's
quarterback to be scared. He wants
his player's technique to be perfect.
But more than anything, Mattison
wants to help give Michigan fans a
reason to be proud.
With a collective effort from
everyone involved with the team
- from players to coaches to admin-
istrators - there's no doubt in Mat-
tison's mind that Michigan will do
just that.
"I know in my heart what's about
to happen here," he said. "We're
gonna have a football program that
Bo, (former) coach (Gary) Moeller,
former coach (Lloyd) Carr are
gonna be proud of again, and a pro-
gram that has been built for many,
many years of doing it the way we
are tryingto do it right now.
"I justbelieve in my heart that it's
gonna happen."

Roundtree to anchor Hoke likes battle in backfield
wide receiving corps ByMICHAELFLOREK

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan football team's
receivers had something few posi-
tion groups on the team have:
depth. Now, with senior Darryl
Stonum forced to redshirt, they're
going to have to show how deep
the unit is from the outset.
Stonum was expected to start at
the position but after Stonum was
arrested this summer for a DUI -
the second of his collegiate career
- he was suspended by Michigan
coach Brady Hoke indefinitely.
Sunday the hammer came down:
he won't play at all this season.
The Stonum move likely causes
redshirt junior Roy Roundtree to
move outside from the slot after
earning All-Big Ten second-team
honors and being on the Bilet-
nikoff Award watch list last sea-
son. Roundtree has said he can
play both inside and outside if
needed.
He came just 65 yards short of
being Michigan's first 1,000 yard
receiver since 2007, although more
than a quarter of that produc-
tion came in one game - a school
record-setting 246-yard perfor-
mance against Illinois.
With junior quarterback
Denard Robinson coming into
his second year as a starter and a
return to a pro-style offense that
should have some similarities to
the ones that have created so many
Wolverine 1,000 yard receivers
over the years, Roundtree should
approach the 1,000-yard mark
again.
Fifth-year senior Junior
Hemingway, who is no stranger
to big plays, should step into Sto-
num's place on the other side.
The physical, 6-foot-1, 225
pounder had 593 yards and four
touchdowns last season. He uses
his size well, as seen in his catch
against Indiana that set up the
game-winning touchdown. He
fought off an Indiana defensive
back to make a catch at the Hoo-
siers four-yard line with 21 sec-
onds left back on Oct. 2.
Behind Hemingway are a num-
ber of other options on the out-
side, including sophomore Jeremy
Jackson, junior Je'Ron Stokes and
redshirt freshman Jerald Robin-
son. Jackson saw action in r' 'e
games last season, but it was Rob-
inson who Hoke mentioned that

he was impressed with at Big Ten
Media Days.
"I think he's matured," Hoke
said. "I think freshman when they
come in and even into their sopho-
more year, they've got all this free
time to some degree, which they
think is free time, which really
shouldn't be free time and they
don't pay attention to the details as
much as they should. And I think
that's helped him with his ability.
He's letting his ability really work
for him."
In the slot, senior Martavious
Odoms and fifth-year senior Kel-
vin Grady have the inside track.
Odoms, who has seen significant
playing time in each of his past
three years, showed enough block-
ing ability to be moved outside last
year.
With Hoke talking everything
physical, Odoms' blocking may
push him to ahead of Grady.
At tight end, it's senior Kevin
Koger and then everyone else.
Koger, who was utilized more as
a pass catcher than a blocker in
Rodriguez's offense, caught 14
balls for 199 yards and two touch-
downs in 2010. But over the sum-
mer, the third-year starter has
been gaining pounds to prove to he
can both block and catch.
"From a physical standpoint,
muscle mass and strength and
that, I think he has made some
really good gains," Hoke said.
And while "everyone else" is a
step below Koger, there's a variety
of options. A number of them have
been singled out as impressing in
captains-led summer workouts.
Redshirt junior Brandon Moore
hasn't played much, but appears
to be the first option off the bench.
Fifth-year senior Steve Watson
has impressed in the summer
7-on-7s, leading to Denard Robin-
son commenting on how good his
hands were at Big Ten Media Days.
Michigan averaged 250 yards
per game through the air in Rich
Rodriguez's spread offense.
Whether it's at wide receiver or
tight end, Denard Robinson has
options.
While Hoke emphasized that he
wants a power run game, he also
wants to win. He mentioned that
he's "smart enough not to put a
square peg in a round hole" when
it comes to Denard Robinson's
rushing ability. He's also smart
enough to use his options.

After four days of the Michigan
football team's camp, only one thing
is clear regarding the Wolverines'
feature back to start the season: no
one has any idea who it is.
Offensive coordinator Al Borges
and senior running back Mike Shaw
have said as much, while Michigan
coach Brady Hoke said it twice in
the same week.
But the decision shouldn't take
too much longer. Full-pads practic-
es started Friday. For the first time
this fall, Hoke will have the chance
to truly "hear football" for the first
time, a requirement for picking the
right back.
"It's hard to judge to some degree
until we start really putting them
down and seeing them protect with
a big linebacker coming," Hoke said.
"How are they going to hold up
there?"
Hoke mentioned that he hoped
the next eight days would bring out
a front-runner, leaving him the rest
of camp to start focusing on game
planning for the upcoming season.
Those days will be filled with full-
pads practices and the occasional
two-a-days. And those practices
will need to be heard a lot more than
these last couple.
"I told them last night I didn't
hear (practice) yesterday," Hoke
said. "I heard ita little better today,
but hearing football is important. It
kind of tells you what's going on, but
luckily it's not September 3rd."
In the meantime, any thoughts
about the coaches have at running

Michigan, Ohio State rivalry heads outdoors

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
An outdoor game between the
Ohio State and Michigan hockey
programs was imminent in May,
nearly a done deal in June, and dead
in July.
But now it's official.
The Cleveland Indians held
a press conference Thursday to
announce the finalized plans to
host their first outdoor hockey
game, dubbed The Frozen Diamond
Faceoff, at Progressive Field on Jan.
15, 2012.
"You have avid fans from Michi-
gan and Ohio State," Indians
president Mark Shapiro said in an
Indians' press release. "You have a
rivalry that's meaningful. You also
have a unique event that will draw
some event-goers just to come in to
the ballpark. It'll be the first time in
the state of Ohio and be a very spe-
cial atmosphere. So I think when
you combine all those things, it's
our hope that there aren't any seats
open."
It will be the Buckeyes' second
appearance in an outdoor game, but
the Wolverines' fourth - and their
third outdoor match in the past
three seasons. Ohio State is 0-1 out-
doors,while Michigan is 1-1-1.

"We're looking forward to it,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson said
in a Michigan press release. "It
will be the first time I've ever been
involved or a Michigan hockey team
will be involved in an outdoor game
in a baseball stadium. We've played
in football stadiums before and
every one of these games takes on
kind of a life of its own.
"Even though Michigan has
played in three in a row, a lot of our
players haven't had that experience.
We have a big freshman class and
we've got some players on our team
that didn't get to dress last year. This
will be right in the middle of the
hockey season and something that
may not get a lot of attention early
in the year, but as it gets closer, this
will be a big deal."
Michigan was a part of the first-
ever NCAA outdoor game, the Cold
War against Michigan State, in Oct.
2001.
But most fans will recall The
Big Chill at the Big House between
the Spartans and Wolverines last
December at Michigan Stadium.
The event drew a world-record
crowd of 104,173.
By measurement, The Frozen
Diamond Faceoff aims to be the
Big Chill's infant brother. Progres-
sive Fiedd has a seating capacity of

roughly 45,200 during the base-
ball season. Although additional
seating may well be installed for a
hockey game, it won't be setting any
records.
"An event at a venue like Progres-
sive Field is great for both the insti-
tutions and the league as a whole,"
CCHA Commissioner Fred Pletsch
said in a press release. "We're look-
ing forward to coming to Cleveland
this Januaryto see a terrific rivalry
showcased in a distinctive and
memorable setting."
The game will be a part of Cleve-
land's Snow Days, which will also
feature a week-long youth tourna-
ment.
In 2010, the first Snow Days was
highlighted by ice skating, sled-
ding hills and snow tubing chutes.
According to Crain's Cleveland
Business, the event drew 50,000
visitors downtown from Nov. 26 to
Jan. 2 last year.
The location of Cleveland -s rela-
tively ideal, since it lies equidistant
- about 150 miles - from both
Columbus and Ann Arbor.
The Wolverines hold an all-time
65-30-11 edge in head-to-head
matches against the Buckeyes.
Michigan completed the 2010-11
season first in the CCHA, while
Ohio State crawled in at No. 9.

Anderson, Robertson represent 'M' at University Games

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Writer
For former Michigan water
polo standout Leah Robertson,
it's a huge honor to compete for
4 Team USA at the World University
Games taking place in Shenzhen,
China.
Having been in the United
States National Water Polo system
for a long time - playing for the
Junior National team in 2005, the
Senior National "B" Team in 2008,
and practicing with the Senior
national team in 2010 - the New-
port Beach, Calif. native is excited
to get her first chance to travel
overseas to represent her country.
She is also thrilled to be a part of
the first United States women's
water polo team to compete at the
World University Games.
But what really makes these
games so special for Robertson is
the opportunity to play for Matt
a Anderson, her former coach at
Michigan.

"Its such a gift," Robertson
said. "Matt and I were very close
during my time at Michigan.
"My four years of playing at
Michigan were probably the
greatest water polo experiences
of my life. The chance to play for
him again is really special and that
made this opportunity more excit-
ing for me."
Robertson, a senior captain in
2010, was a prominent part of the
team during her time at Michi-
gan, helping the Wolverines reach
three straight NCAA Champion-
ships to finish off her collegiate
career. Recruited to Michigan for
her formidable defense, Robert-
son starred.
She anchored Michigan's
defense throughout her years,
helping the Wolverines establish
an imposing presence on that side
of the ball.
She holds the program record
for most steals in a game, season
and in a career. She also ranks
second all-time for career drawn

"As for growing as a person,

holds everyone to the highest 4
standard and it really makes you

or school."
For Anderson, he's just happy .t
to be able to coach such a special
player one more time.
"It's really an honor to have the q
opportunity to coach this team,"
Anderson said. "It's just really
special to be able to coach Leah
because she's just an amazing
player."
