Former HUD secretary 
talks diversity and equity

Obama appointee 
stresses importance 
of teaching in speech

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

On 
Wednesday 
afternoon, 

Julián Castro, former Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development 
under President Barack Obama 
from 2014 to 2017, addressed a 
crowd of approximately 100 at 
the Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre 
in the Michigan League. 

The talk, titled “Leadership in 

a Changing Democratic Society,” 
was put on by the National 
Forum on Higher Education for 
the Public Good — an initiative 
housed at the University of 
Michigan’s School of Education 
and overseen by the Center 
of Higher and Postsecondary 
Education to encourage higher 
education in the public sphere 
and 
communicate 
knowledge 

of higher education issues; it 
is funded by foundations, such 

as Kellogg and Ford, and also 
sponsored 
by 
the 
American 

Association for Hispanics in 
Higher Education.

The event was also presented 

in partnership with the Office of 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, 
the School of Education and 
Rackham Graduate School.

The 
National 
Forum, 
in 

collaboration with the National 
Center for Institutional Diversity, 
also oversees the New Leadership 
Academy 
— 
a 
program 
to 

empower leadership development 
in 
higher 
education; 
several 

fellows from the New Leadership 
Academy were in attendance at 
the event. Also in attendance 
were the leaders of several units 
of the University who work in 
advancing and implementing the 
University’s five-year plan for 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, 
which launched in October.

In an interview, John C. 

Burkhardt, the director of the 
National 
Forum 
and 
special 

assistant to the provost for 
University 
engagement, 

explained 
that 
the 
Forum 

strives to better the relationship 
between higher education and a 
changing democracy.

“Our role is to help to enhance 

the role that higher education 
plays in a changing, increasingly 
diverse 
democratic 
society,” 

he said. “The New Leadership 
Academy is a partnership we have 
with the American Association of 
Hispanics in Higher Education … 
(The organization) partners with 
us in developing a fellowship 
for individuals who aspire to 
leadership in higher education.”

Prior 
to 
Castro’s 
keynote 

speech, Carol Fierke, Dean of 
Rackham 
Graduate 
School, 

welcomed the audience with 
some opening remarks, noting 
the progress of the DEI plan. 

“This 
effort 
is 
currently 

about eight months old but 
we’ve already made many gains 
because we are building on a 
long history and foundation of 
effort from our students, faculty 
and staff to increase access, 
promote awareness of our diverse 
backgrounds and understand the

Several attendees 
voice distrust over 
review’s methods at 
community forum

By ANDREW HIYAMA
Summer Daily News Editor

Dozens of residents showed up 

to the Bryant Community Center in 
southern Ann Arbor Tuesday night 
to listen to and participate in a forum 
on police-community relations. The 
event was hosted by representatives 
of Hillard Heintze LLC, the Chicago-
based 
security 
firm 
currently 

conducting a review of the Ann Arbor 
Police Department.

The first phase of the review — 

so far the only phase approved by 
City Council — consists of the firm 
gathering of data and listening to 
community and police perspectives 
through surveys and community 
forums. Then, the firm will present 
a report to City Council containing 
recommendations based on their 
findings.

Debra Kirby, the Senior Vice 

President 
of 
Law 
Enforcement 

Consulting at Hillard Heintze, said 
at the forum she anticipates the 
report will be delivered to the City 
around the end of July, and that she 
had received assurances from City 
Administrator Howard Lazarus that 
the report will be made public “once 
it’s accepted by the city.”

“I think that’s an important step 

here, because in some cities, these 
types of reports never see the light of 
day,” Kirby said. “And so Ann Arbor, 
the city itself, has put itself out there,

Rackham conference showcases findings
and innovations in decision-making

The four-day event 
brought together 
researchers, students 
and professionals 
across disciplines

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

The 
third 
Multidisciplinary 

Conference 
on 
Reinforcement 

Learning and Decision Making 
took place at the Rackham Graduate 
School 
between 
Sunday 
and 

Thursday this week.

Reinforcement learning refers to 

the relationship between the agent 
— like a person or robot, for example 
— and the environment — like a 
video game or puzzle the agent is 
trying to complete. The environment 
represents a certain state of being, 
while the agent acts upon that state 
and receives a reward, or response. 

The 
four-day 
event 
saw 

researchers, 
professionals 
and 

students from several disciplines, 
including psychology and computer 
science, come together to discuss 

discoveries 
and 
innovations 
in 

decision-making.

Among 
the 
event 
speakers 

were Ece Kamar, a researcher 
from Microsoft who specializes in 
artificial intelligence, Joelle Pineau, 
an assistant professor of computer 
science at McGill University and Kent 
Berridge, James Olds Distinguished 
University Professor of Psychology 
and Neuroscience at the University of 
Michigan.

The days were broken into sessions 

of several brief presentations from 
speakers describing their work.

On 
Tuesday 
afternoon, 
Max 

Kleiman-Weiner, a Ph.D. student in 
Computational Cognitive Science 
at MIT, presented “Learning to 
Cooperate and Compete.”

Prefacing his address with a 

quote from psychologist Nicholas 
Humphrey, Kleiman-Weiner related 
social interactions to games — 
incorporating elements of game 
theory in his presentation.

From a research standpoint, games 

like tic-tac-toe and checkers have 
effectively been solved and can be 
modeled by computers, he explained. 
There are other games where 
computers can act like humans, but 
cannot necessarily solve the game, 

such as in a game of chance.

“It’s these kinds of ad hoc 

interactions 
that 
involve 
lots 

of 
complexity, 
where 
you’re 

cooperatively playing a game, but 
there might be aspects of competition 
in that game that can explain a lot of 
the richness of human cooperative 
behavior in a lot of that real world 
contexts that we might want to have 
machines working with us and at 
least understanding us, so things 
like how to negotiate, playground 
games,” he said. “We want to study 
cooperation.”

There are models for studying 

cooperation, 
one 
of 
which 
is 

the prisoner’s dilemma, which 
highlights 
a 
struggle 
between 

what is good for the well-being of 
both players versus what is more 
advantageous to a single player. 
Mathematically, the dilemma points 
to tension between cooperation and 
competition but, experimentally, it 
doesn’t capture several important 
factors, according to Kleiman-
Weiner.

He 
explained 
his 
team 
of 

researchers designed a system to 
overcome obstacles presented in 
current models of cooperation.

“What we’ve done… to study 

these questions both in a way where 
we can build more models and look 
at human behavior is to take an 
approach that’s been well studied 
in multi-agent systems literature,” 
he said.

The 
team 
developed 
games 

with 
naturalistic 
environments 

that people can play intuitively, 
like video games. The games can 
represent different social situations.

“If we have these programs, we 

can sort of reconstruct the original 
social dilemma and think, ‘Well, 
I have this choice to cooperate or 
compete, and that corresponds 
to certain rewards,’ ” he said. “In 
reality, it’s a lot more challenging 
than that.”

Different ways of implementing 

potential plans yield different 
payoffs, 
Kleiman-Weiner 

explained. However, the team aims 
to build algorithms to play the 
games.

Difficulties 
arise 
when 
the 

researchers want to be able to 
plan at a high level of abstraction 
— 
determining 
cooperation 

or competition — but need to 
implement these goals through 
low-level actions, like moves in 
a game. They need to be able to 
determine if certain low-level 
actions confirm the higher-level 
goals. Furthermore, they also 
want to coordinate cooperation 
across different scenarios, so as 
to generalize and create coherent 
plans to tackle certain games.

Overall, 
the 
researchers 

aim to make plans for using 
generalizations and best-response 
scenarios for competition and 
coordination using reinforcement 
learning.

University researchers study bilingualism in Argentina 
from both a linguistic and sociocultural perspective

Study explores 

bicultural practices 

and languages

By JENNIFER MEER

Summer Managing News Editor

A research project conducted 

through the University of Michigan 
is bringing together linguists and 
cultural analysts to better under-
stand bicultural communities.

The project, titled “Argentine 

Afrikaners: Interrogating Hybridity 
in a Unique Diasporic Community,” 
looks at a bilingual community in 
Patagonia, Argentina to better under-
stand cultural and linguistic rela-
tions between Afrikaans, a language 
spoken in South Africa, and Argen-
tinian Spanish, a language spoken in 
South America, communities. 

It is one of three projects that 

received 
proposal 
development 

grants 
for 
research 
from 
the 

Humanities Collaboratory in Febru-
ary.

Overseen by the provost and the 

Institute for the Humanities, the 
Michigan Humanities Collabora-
tory serves as a resource for research 
in the humanities. It promotes team-
based work, as well as communica-
tion of research and humanities 
scholars.

For May and June, the grant pro-

vides funding to the team, fostering 
collaboration between its linguists 
and socio-cultural team members 
— anthropologists and religious his-
torians, among them — to analyze 
their data and share ideas.

Nicholas Henriksen, an assistant 

professor of spanish linguistics, is 
the principal investigator on the 
project. He described the grant’s 
mission to bring together different 
perspectives.

“One of the stipulations of the 

grant is that all of the collaborators 
meet and talk and bring together 
ideas from different disciplines,” 
he said. “By listening to people 
who work in different disciplines, 
with different backgrounds, one 
nice advantage is we’ve been able 
to understand the community from 
different perspectives, which we 
wouldn’t have done if we were just 

working on this independently.”

In general, the linguists observe 

the speech patterns of the bilingual 
speakers.

“We’re exploring their hybrid 

speech patterns,” he said. “When a 
bilingual speaker speaks, sometimes 
there will be an influence from one 
of his or her two languages when 
they speak the second language.” 

Henriksen said typically linguists 

only look for speech patterns and 
concentrate on sounds, as opposed 
to analyzing content.

Other colleagues on the project 

are experts in history and cultural 
practices. According to Henriksen, 
they are helping to analyze the com-
munity based on such practices and 
beliefs — religious, racial and ethnic 
differences, among others. 

“The two sides of the team kind 

of work together to study our speech 
community and its hybrid practic-
es,” he said. “On the one hand, the 
linguists come together; on the other 
hand, the social-cultural members 
come together. We are able to por-
tray a picture of these speakers, of 
our speech community, because of 
the hybridity, but not just looking at 

COURTESY OF LORENZO GARCIA-AMAYA 

Researchers discuss findings from different disciplines as part of their project to 
better understand bicultural communities. 

one or the other — bringing both of 
those together.”

Lorenzo García-Amaya, who is also 

an assistant professor of spanish lin-
guistics, is a researcher on the project. 
He works primarily with speech pro-
duction of second-language learners.

The linguists, he explained, use a 

software to help analyze the speech. 
Several undergraduate students also 
help to analyze recordings of inter-
views with the speakers from Argen-
tina in both Afrikaans and Spanish.

García-Amaya said the collabora-

tion has been extremely helpful. He 
said it was interesting how the socio-
cultural members were quick to pick 
up on certain cues — hesitations, 
pauses and interruptions — when the 
speakers discussed issues of race and 
indigeneity, among others, as these 
topics might be sensitive to some.

García-Amaya 
explained 
lin-

guists themselves may not track 
these occurrences on their own, as 
they would normally conduct a more 
quantitative study measuring fre-
quency.

“In a personal experience, it is 

something that is wonderful — I have 
been able to learn from them...” he 

said. “It has been a surprising aspect 
of the collaboratory — how much this 
informs the type of analysis that we 
conduct in our lab.”

The community of interest con-

sists of approximately 40 bilingual 
individuals — 20 of whom were 
interviewed for the project — who 
are descendents of immigrants who 
arrived in Argentina around 1902. 
These 
immigrants 
maintained 

Calvinist beliefs, coming from the 
Dutch Reformed Church. The inter-
viewed group speaks both Afrikaans 
and Spanish — Afrikaans was the 
exclusive language until the 1950s 
— though their children likely only 
speak Spanish, as it became domi-
nant later on. There were 15 inter-
viewees for the project who spoke 
only Spanish.

Originally, Henriksen explained, 

the group wanted to focus on reli-
gious 
ideology 
and 
differences. 

Many speakers had a predominantly 
Calvinist upbringing but later were 
influenced by Argentine Catholicism. 
 

context in which we experience 
our society and learn by pushing 
the limits of our individual 
perspectives,” she said.

Fierke said sometimes DEI 

efforts are at odds with one 
another. She also said diversity 
is not always inclusive and 
inclusion is not always equitable 
inclusion.

“Our 
conversations 
must 

account 
for 
this 
emergent, 

dualistic framework that is often 
conditional to our institutional 
value,” she said.

University alum Evelyn Galvan 

introduced Castro, where she 
stated the event should serve as 
an opportunity for the University 
to 
invite 
conversations 
and 

support action.

“The University of Michigan 

and its students have an amazing 
legacy of being at the forefront 
of activism and participation 
in national movements — being 
a champion of diversity and 
this is an opportunity for us to 

contribute to that tradition,” she 
said.

Galvan 
noted 
the 
recent 

incident in which employees, 
who were immigrants, were 
detained at Sava’s restaurant. 

“Sadly these situations are 

continuing in our community 
and they’re happening with 
greater frequency,” she said. 
“Similar to our keynote speaker, 
I am also from a family of 
immigrants. The abuses faced 
by members of our community 
impact my life but also motivate 
my activism.”

Castro 
served 
as 
the 

Democratic 
Party’s 
first 

Hispanic keynote convention 
speaker in 2012; the grandson 
of an immigrant from Mexico 
and raised by a single mother, 
he was the youngest elected 
city councilman in San Antonio, 
Texas, before becoming the 
city’s mayor. 

He is an advocate for urban 

revitalization and education for 
students from disadvantaged 
communities.

hearing.’ “

Many residents at the forum, 

however, expressed their frustration 
and disappointment both with the 
lack of transparency in the AAPD 
as well as the current progress of 
the review and the methods it had 
incorporated.

Local 
tensions 
around 

community-police 
relations 

intensified in November 2014 when 
Aura Rosser, a Black woman with 
bipolar disorder, was fatally shot 
by Ann Arbor police, and months 
later when the Washtenaw County 
Prosecutor’s Office decided not to 
press charges against the officer 
on the grounds it was lawful self-
defense. Ann Arbor resident Shirley 
Beckley said the review so far had 
not sufficiently included the people 
it was intended to benefit — Black 
residents.

OPINION

W

hen I was six years 
old, my eager parents 
signed 
me 
up 
for 

private violin lessons to my 
absolute 
dismay. 
Under 
their 

pressure, I would trudge through 
my early musical career for the 
next four years or so – tears and 
tantrums included – until one day 
in the fifth grade, it wasn’t my 
parents pushing me anymore.

That 
day 
was 
instrument-

sampling day for elementary band 
and orchestra, and my whole class 
had heard me play a piece from 
private lessons. They fell silent 
and 
turned 
their 
10-year-old 

heads to me in awe, upon which 
I uncovered a pleasant surprise: 
I was actually good! I was the 
best in the room and the center of 
attention. That day, I tasted power 
and I bathed in pride. And I clung 
to it — though I could’ve spared 
myself by letting go.

For the years to come, this pride 

became my devil disguised as 
innocent passion. I thrived in my 
modest middle school orchestra 
program, steadily inflating my 
ego as I embraced my reputation 
as a musical superior. Without 
knowing it, I fell in love with the 
idea of being good at something, 
the meaningless glory of sitting 
at the front of the orchestra, the 
dangerous reputation of being 
unbeatable and untouchable — the 
best.

Thus, by the time I entered my 

high school orchestra program, 
one of the most awarded and 
competitive in the nation, I put 

my self-worth up for grabs, along 
with the title I’d been taking for 
granted. To my surprise, there 
were students who had been 
taking lessons for even longer 
than I had. They had more 
expensive teachers and even 
more expensive instruments, and 
they had their eye on the same 
fame that I didn’t know I would 
have to fight for.

But all of this only made me 

hungrier to remain at the top. 
After all those years of being the 
best, I wasn’t ready to be anyone 
else, and I didn’t know that I 
could. When I came up second, 
I lost my self-worth, but not my 
pride. I practiced harder and 
harder, all the while claiming 
that I did so out of passion. 
But I walked to orchestra with 
dread each day, secretly making 
enemies with my competitor and 
not-so-secretly, with myself.

Deep down, I knew that I did 

not enjoy what I did, because 
when I did come up first – when 
I finally regained my reputation 
and worthiness – I stopped 
practicing. Needing no more 
than a title to feed my ego, I 
was happiest when completing 
the bare minimum: sitting in 
my precious first-row seat and 
creating a mere impression of 
fine musicianship.

In this way, I hovered around 

the top of the ridiculous orchestral 
hierarchy 
for 
four 
years, 

wondering how someone could 
simultaneously be so egotistic and 
so, so insecure. When I graduated 

high school, I was relieved to 
leave behind the competition 
anxiety that had steadily crept to 
each area of my life.

But I could not graduate my 

pride.

Following months of severe 

lack of practice, I was placed at 
the rear of the Campus Symphony 
Orchestra at Michigan. Ashamed 
of the “downgrade” and even 
more so of still caring, I quit and 
casted my violin aside.

Since then, I’d touched my 

instrument less than a handful 
of times, often forgetting, even 
refusing, to play in fear of the 
unfulfilling 
memories 
we’ve 

shared. It seems strange to 
me that this hollow wooden 
specimen and the even hollower 
reputation it brought me had 
defined me for so long, when it 
took only a year for me to find 
stability otherwise.

And perhaps that’s why it took 

me so long to realize how much 
I’ve missed being a violinist. 
So today, sitting alone in the 
lethargic heat of my summer 
apartment, I did something I 
almost swore I’d never do again 
— I played it. The act felt faraway 
and foreign, and there was no use 
in denying it: I was no longer the 
best, if I ever was. But I’d become 
so tired of demanding this of 
myself and so glad I’d been freed 
from it, that at last, I was no 
longer bothered. Instead, I was 
my new fingers – rough calluses 
gone, rejuvenated, raw.

Yet, it shocked me just how

familiar 
each 
movement 
felt. 

While my skills had undoubtedly 
rusted, there remained a certain 
authority with which my fingers 
commanded the strings, and a 
striking ease with which they 
danced about them – albeit only 
a fraction of their former speed. 
Reciting old pieces by memory 
from the safety of my new 
bedroom, I felt unexpectedly at 
peace, and it dawned on me.

For years, my long hours of 

practice had been so clouded by 
the critique and competition that 
I’d been blinded to the essence of 
it all. While my toil and title alike 
are long gone, there is greater 
glory in what is preserved – how 
much I’ve learned about music 
and how its every motion and 
emotion has forever shaped me 

into a musician.

This time, I was not practicing 

for an audition or a concert, not 
priming myself for scrutiny or 
judgment. This time, I was playing 
for none other than myself, 
because there would be no one 
there to listen.

And with that, I felt awakened, 

like everything I’ve ever done for 
the wrong reason came crashing 
down on my door. Wondering how 
I’d been ready to leave behind so 
innate and permanent a part of 
me for an image so transient and 
trivial, I realized that for the first 
time, I was playing violin for fun.

But it wouldn’t be the last.

here is a story I often tell 
people which I believe 
captures 
the 
absolutely 

cliché 
nature 
of 
my 
“all-

American childhood” — and also 
demonstrates why I grew up a little 
more mature than other kids.

It’s a story about my dead dog.
Way back in time when my 

imagination flourished and my 
sense of society was confined to 
the people in my Catholic school, 
my parents decided that a puppy 
would make an excellent addition 
to the white picket fence, big 
backyard and two-screaming-
kids family they had created.

And after a trip to the local 

humane society, they brought 
home what they called a puppy, 
but it was obvious that this 
“puppy” was something others 
did not want. With a grotesque 
underbite 
and 
over-muscled 

body — this pug, Pomeranian and 
Chihuahua mix sat unwanted in 
the pound for weeks before my 
parents adopted him on the spot. 
My overjoyed younger sister and 
I named him Cosmo, after a goofy 
character in the Nickelodeon 
show “The Fairly OddParents.”

And Cosmo was odd — he 

proceeded 
to 
terrorize 
our 

neighborhood by jumping fences, 
eating bees, fighting German 
Shepherds, eating more bees, 
literally attacking mailmen and 
eating so many bees.

Yet he also fulfilled all the other 

cliché obligations that only these 
brilliantly stupid and loyal animals 
can do. He ran alongside us down 
grassy trails in the summer and 
chased us in our sleds down 
Michigan hills in the winter. He 

slept at the foot of our beds every 
night. And he barked and jumped 
in joy when we came back home, 
whether we were gone for three 
minutes or three days.

And as a ten-year-old boy 

growing up in the suburban 
Midwest, my life was complete 
with 
my 
small, 
moronic 

companion 
who 
would 
run 

alongside my bike as I rode 
around my neighborhood. All I 
needed was a paper route and 
the theme music from “The 
Andy 
Griffith 
Show.” 
There 

exists a dynamic between a kid 
and a dog that I can only hope 
everyone has the opportunity to 
experience. The fierce, undying 
loyalty of a canine mixed with 
the innocent and loving qualities 
of childhood creates something 
that is impossible to replicate. 
I spent every day with that dog 
and loved nearly every second.

So, when he died suddenly 

after only two years, my fragile, 
pathetic 11-year-old psyche was 
permanently damaged.

It was cold and windy day in 

early February — my parents 
picked my sister and I up from 
school and drove us home to the 
shallow grave my father dug in 
our backyard. Cradling our pet for 
the last time, my dad placed him 
inside as the wind whipped the 
unearthed dirt and snow around 
us.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“

Did you see the fight between 
Hunter Strickland and uh, 
what’s his name?” my dad asked 

me a few weeks ago.

I hadn’t, so when I hung up the 

phone, I did a Google search and the 
results were instantaneous. During 
the game, the San Francisco Giants’ 
pitcher, Hunter Strickland, hit Bryce 
Harper, a batter for the Washington 
Nationals, with the ball. A fight 
ensued and both teams cleared their 
benches to join in the fight. It had 
become an all-out brawl of sorts, guys 
on each side throwing punches and 
pulling players off each other.

The first article I clicked on started 

off giving a play-by-play of the fight, 
and a few paragraphs in, the author 
wrote, “the most entertaining part for 
me was…” Then the author went on to 
crack a joke about how Harper’s helmet 
throw at Strickland was so bad it was 
“funny.” I stopped reading. This was 
a fight, where people threw punches. 
People piled on top of each other, and 
without the extra protection provided 
by padding and helmets for football 
players. Both Strickland and Harper 
were suspended for multiple games. 
This fight was no joke, and it certainly 
didn’t feel like something we could call 
“entertaining.”

Don’t get me wrong. I have loved 

baseball since I was a little kid. Some 
of the most memorable parts of my 
childhood were sitting on my dad’s lap 
in his tiny home office watching the 
game on his fuzzy first-generation TV 
and eating hotdogs and popcorn at the 
park until I was sick. But as a lifelong 
fan, it’s incredibly upsetting to me that 
we aren’t treating violence as violence. 
It shouldn’t be chalked up to people 
simply getting heated, or people who 
are passionate about their sport.

I read a few more articles, hoping 

for something of substance. And 
while some took on a better tone, 
there were still far too many articles 
that were much of the same. Another 
guy weighed in the on the helmet 
throw. We should all “appreciate” 
the horrible helmet throw, he wrote. 
Another article was entitled, “The 5 
Best Photos from the Bryce Harper-
Hunter Strickland Brawl.” Then in 
one of the videos of the fight that I 
clicked on, I could hear one of my 
favorite 
hometown 
announcers 

during the fight saying, “this is a good 
one folks.”

In fact, just a few days ago, an 

article in The Washington Post 
described how the MLB was 
planning to auction off Strickland’s 
jersey from that game, advertising it 
as the jersey he wore when he “was 
ejected from the game after fighting 

with Bryce Harper.” People on the 
internet also went wild with memes 
of the fight.

And imbedded within these 

articles and memes was something I 
found equally, if not more upsetting. 
People were quick to pounce on the 
Giants’ catcher, Buster Posey, who 
stayed out of the fight, and MLB 
fans were also unnecessarily critical. 
Instead of questioning why he didn’t 
get involved, instead of roasting him 
for not “helping his man,” as one fan 
wrote, we should be questioning why 
everyone else didn’t stay out of it. We 
should be applauding him for not 
getting involved, not shaming him 
for not putting himself at risk and 
adding fuel to the fight. And maybe, 
we should be taking a page from 
Posey’s book. We need to discourage, 
not encourage, this type of violence.

Yes, I know that for these players, 

this is their career, and like many 
passionate people, they can get 
heated 
and 
sometimes 
violent, 

especially if they think something big 
is on the line. But that isn’t something 
we should be comfortable with. And 
where else in a professional setting is 
violence such as this egged on? How 
often do you see a lawyer charging at 
the opposing counsel and throwing 
punches at them during a trial 
treated as entertainment? Sports and 
baseball shouldn’t be any different.

Instead of indulging fighting and 

violence in sports, as journalists, 
citizens, leagues, associations and 
fans, we should be working on 
sanctions and programs to minimize 
it. Journalists, calling the fight 
“entertaining,” the internet making 
memes of the fight, the MLB for 
advertising a jersey for auction as 
one that they brawled in, are part of 
the larger problem and encourage a 
sports culture where violence is not 
only acceptable, but a part of what 
makes the sport fun. 

Furthermore, this culture of 

normalized violence in sports has 
already made a big impact and will 
continue to do so unless something 
changes. In response to the fight, 
Harper said “sometimes you just 
gotta go and get them and can’t 
hesitate,” even if you might be 
suspended. And Strickland, in an 
interview, said he also didn’t regret 
the fight. Jake Arrieta of the Chicago 
Cubs called the fight “awesome.” But 
they should have regretted what they 
did; fights aren’t “awesome.”

After all, would this Giants-

Nationals 
brawl 
be 
considered 

“funny” if someone was seriously 
injured and it ended his season? 
Because as far as the game goes, 

everyone should realize they have 
a stake in making sure athletes are 
healthy: teams that want to win, the 
players who want to stay in the game, 
fans who want to see their favorite 
players play, owners who don’t want 
to pay a player to sit on the bench, the 
list goes on.

And even though sports such as 

football involve tackling and other 
somewhat dangerous play, there 
are still guidelines put in place to 
minimize the violence. In football, 
there are penalties for punching and 
other unsportsmanlike conduct; the 
NBA has fouls for excessive or violent 
contact that could result in injury. In 
the MLB, if you’re a batter hit by a ball 
at the plate, in almost every case, you 
get to advance to first base.

What’s more, professional sports 

are constantly working to make 
game play safer. In 2012, MLB 
adopted new concussion protocols. 
In 2014, new rules were made up 
for home plate collisions. In 2009, 
the NFL acknowledged the long-
term effects of concussions for the 
first time and since then began 
implementing stricter concussion-
prevention measures. Some of these 
rules have come after injuries such 
as Posey’s home plate collision in 
2011, or when journalists and player 
advocates have put a spotlight on the 
dangers of concussions in all sports, 
and especially football.

So, if we are constantly trying to 

make the game itself safer, shouldn’t we 
also want the same for the moments in 
between the plays? The seconds before 
two players with a long rivalry seem like 
they’re about to charge at each other? 

And 
masking 
violence 
as 

entertainment and player passion will 
have consequences that will carry on 
for generations. Young kids who are 
watching and taking their cues from 
their parents, friends, favorite players 
and idolized journalists will grow up 
thinking this is acceptable behavior in 
sports — and likely in other aspects of 
their lives. In fact, in a 2015 Gallup poll, 
59 percent of Americans said they were 
sports fans. Sports seep into everyday 
life and has the power to influence so 
many people, even outside of those 
who follow or participate in sports. 
And thanks to the internet, it’s easy 
for anyone to stumble across videos 
and memes of these fights. So, it’s up 
to everyone, players, coaches, fans and 
journalists to change the way we talk 
about violence and fighting in sports. 
Otherwise, we all pay the price.

Clean up the game

I

n my last column, I mentioned 
learning about the Adena 
people, who lived on the 

land now called Ohio from more 
than 2,000 years ago to the first 
century A.D., when the Adena 
were overcome by and blended into 
other tribes. Though some of their 
physical traces have been marked 
and preserved, much evidence of 
the Adena people has disappeared 
over the centuries. This is true 
throughout central Ohio, including 
my hometown of Bexley.

The Adena’s physical legacy 

is manifest mostly in the form of 
burial mounds filled with tools and 
remains of individuals from their 
small farming communities. There 
are mounds all over central Ohio, 
but some are easier to identify 
than others because they vary in 
size and are seldom marked. Some 
Adena mounds are only a couple 
feet high and may look like a slight 
swell in the ground, while others 
are more than 20 feet high, perfect 
semicircles sitting atop what was 
once flat earth.

Obviously, 
these 
burial 

mounds 
were 
significant 
to 

Adena 
communities, 
but 
for 

myriad reasons (including federal 
regulations) most of the mounds 
in central Ohio have no historical 
markers identifying them as 
significant sites. Even worse, 
many have been destroyed in 
the process of farming and land 
development. This means burial 
mounds, 
containing 
artifacts 

and human remains, have been 
ploughed, built over or otherwise 
demolished in the process of 
construction.

The McAlla Mound, named 

for the farmer who found it while 
ploughing, is located on a strip of 
land in the city of Columbus that 
abuts Bexley. The site of ancient 
Adena settlements and the McAlla 
Mound correspond generally to 
Wolfe Park, a city park which is 
bordered by Alum Creek on one 
side and a collection of mansions 
on the other. Different maps show 
the mound in different places, and 
the area is hilly. With no marker 
and inconsistent maps, it’s difficult 
to tell what could have once been a 
mound and what is just the natural 
topography. The Adena were there 
once, but even a thorough look 
around wouldn’t tell you that.

Though there are some efforts 

to educate school-aged kids and 
the public about local indigenous 
people’s histories, in general, it 

is difficult to find thorough and 
up-to-date information. Most of 
the contents of the mound are on 
display at the Bexley Historical 
Society (I say “most” because 
what’s left out is the human skull 
allegedly found there, which is 
prohibited from being displayed). 
The Ohio History Connection 
also has an exhibit about the 
history of Native Americans 
in Ohio more generally. And 
a teacher from the Columbus 
School for Girls, a private school 
in Bexley, successfully helped 
her students lobby the Ohio 
legislature to make the Adena 
pipe the state artifact, which is 
commendable for increasing the 
Adena tribe’s visibility.

Still, it seems odd to me that I 

know so little about the Adena 
people and that I’ve had to work 
so hard to find the information I 
now have. I’ve come to what little 
I’ve learned through hours spent 
in the Columbus Metropolitan 
Library, the Bexley Public Library 
and the Bexley Historical Society, 
and through contacting people at 
various organizations who might 
be able to tell me something more.

I wonder what in people’s 

minds would change if there was 
some kind of historical marker in 
the general area where the McAlla 
Mound was found. Unfortunately, 
in the place where the mound is 
or was, I see only colonial revival 
style houses and a park named 
after one of the first prominent 
landowning families in the area.

The story of the Adena people’s 

relationship with the Bexley area’s 
first white settlers is different 
from 
the 
usual 
narrative 
of 

violence between living bodies of 
indigenous people and colonists of 
European descent because Adena 
communities ceased to exist by 
the time colonists arrived to the 
United States. Therefore, they 
didn’t have to choose to trade, 
fight or make what peace they 
could with European settlers or 
their descendants. But the erasure 
of the Adenas’ presence on this 
land is demonstrative of wealthy 
white America’s attitude toward 
indigenous history more broadly 
and represents a violence more 
difficult to trace.

Tigers Jaw talks new 
album and Detroit show

By DOM POLSINELLI

Summer Senior Arts Editor

It’s all too easy for modern pop-

punk/emo bands to throw a couple 
chords together with some relatable 
lyrics to garner millennial atten-
tion. We see it happen all the time. 
However, after nearly a decade of 
songwriting, Scranton’s Tigers Jaw 
has never shown the scars of this 
age-old mediocrity and continuously 
proves their dedication to their art. 
On newest record spin, the band has 
rounded out their catalogue, includ-
ing fast-paced, classically distorted 
cuts like “Make It Up,” and newer 
sounding tracks like 
“Brass Ring.” As a 
whole, the album plays 
off like nostalgia with 
some fresh twists, the 
perfect mix of new cre-
ativity with comforting 
familiarity. This com-
ing Saturday, Tigers 
Jaw are bringing their 
talents to El Club in 
Detroit in support of 
spin, and the Daily had 
the 
opportunity 
to 

speak with keyboard-
ist/vocalist Brianna Collins (oppo-
site Ben Walsh on guitar and vocals) 
about the new record and headlining 
tour.

“I guess what was most important 

to get across is that — I know for Ben 
and I — we knew what we wanted 
the record to sound like. I know Ben 
specifically always has a clear vision 
with tone and… we wanted it to be a 
cohesive record, but also give each 
song the individual attention that we 
felt it deserved,” Collins said of the 
goals for the new record.

These goals are ultimately what 

brought Tigers Jaw to greater 
heights on the new record. The 
album uses Tigers Jaw’s unique 
brand of dreamy emo-pop, making 
gorgeous use of Collins’s work on her 
keyboard. The album is just varied 
enough to make individual tracks 
— most notably “Bullet” and “June” 
— stand out on their own, while feel-
ing cohesive in a complete listen. The 
dichotomy between Walsh and Col-
lins’s voices has always added a dis-
tinctive dynamic to their music, and 
it’s exploited even further on spin. 
The record even features the first 
Tigers Jaw songs that are entirely 

written by Collins on her own, with 
drums and other compositional com-
ponents added by the multi-instru-
mentalist Walsh. Collins’s original 
songs are a staple of spin that helps 
the record stand out from past efforts 
from the band.

“I think [spin] definitely differ-

entiates because I’ve never been a 
primary song writer... I don’t think 
I’ve ever been as vocally present on 
a record. I think Charmer was prob-
ably the first record where we were 
considering adding harmonies and 
where my voice fit into it,” Collins 
said. “Dynamically, it’s not too differ-
ent from how Tigers Jaw was before 

as far as like — you 
know — you have 
two different song-
writers 
putting 

songs together in 
one record. It feels 
like Tigers Jaw to 
me.”

Collins also gave 

insight 
into 
her 

songwriting:

“It 
definitely 

was a crazy process 
for me, especially 
because I’m not like 

a strong guitar player, but I felt more 
comfortable writing songs on guitar 
other than piano. Rhythmically it 
made more sense for me… It was a 
lot of time and effort, but I’m really 
proud of the songs. They’re like my 
first three children, I guess,” Collins 
said followed by some laughter.

Having Collins take the reins on 

three tracks truly pays off on the 
record. Second single “June” shines 
brightly as one of the band’s most 
well-written melodies to date. The 
band consciously chose “June” for 
release ahead of the album to show-
case her talents and involvement on 
the record. With their updated selec-
tion of music, Tigers Jaw shows an 
awareness of their fan base by plan-
ning a mix of all of their material to 
perform on this tour, sure to please 
fans both old and new.

“Because I know when I go to 

see a band — even if I’m so excit-
ed for their new record — it’s not 
the only thing I want to hear. So, 
I think we’ll definitely keep that 
in mind when we’re making our 
setlist. Some old favorites, maybe 
some songs from previous records 
that we haven’t played too often 

or haven’t played in a while to 
keep it fresh,” Collins assured.

After a year of scattered shows 

and a Riot Fest appearance, the 
band is excited to get back to what 
they love most: touring. With sup-
port from Saintseneca and Smid-
ley (whose beautifully varied 
debut self-titled album happens 
to be one of the best releases of 
2017 so far), the shows are certain 
to be nothing less than spectacu-
lar.

The intimate settings of club 

shows are often what are most 
exciting for bands, especially 
when they’re gaining popularity 
as quickly as Tigers Jaw. Commu-
nity is important to the band, and 
they’re looking forward to chat-
ting with old fans and meeting 
new ones at the shows.

“Obviously we enjoy touring. 

We love playing smaller shows 
that are more intimate. Like, after 
a show meeting people, seeing 
people that we’ve met over the 
however many — a decade, we’ve 
been doing this,” Collins said. 
“I’m definitely excited to do a tour 
— to just get in a van, different 
city every night, hanging out with 
our group of friends that we tour 
with. I just love the routine of it at 
this point. I love knowing kind of 
what you’re getting into.”

Collins continued to stress the 

importance of the music com-
munity in comparison to festival 
appearances:

“It’s a different vibe because 

people are obviously coming to the 
show to see your band or one of the 
supporting bands that you were a 
part of choosing for the lineup that 
you love too. So I feel that it’s like 
a community atmosphere, where 
you’re all there for a similar pur-
pose.”

With their energetic live per-

formances and gorgeous new 
material, there’s never been a bet-
ter time to catch Tigers Jaw in 
performance. Coming to one of the 
best venues available to southeast 
Michiganders, Saturday night’s 
show will be an intimate, reward-
ing musical experience. Most 
importantly, it’ll be music coming 
from artists who love their craft.

“What’s most important to us 

with the band is that it’s some-
thing that we love doing.”

Anyone who watched through the 

fourth season finale of “Orange is the 
New Black” knows that it ended on 
its most intense cliffhanger yet. The 
finale, which left off on the question 
of whether or not Daya Diaz (Das-
cha Polanco, “The Perfect Match”) 
would shoot a sadistic prison guard 
(Michael Torpey, “Veep”) and kick 
off a burgeoning riot, not only kept 
the audience in very real suspense; 
it also closed off an excellent season 
that asked sincere and authentic 
questions about morality, society and 
the extent to which life, death and 
human decency are valued within 
a system of incarceration. It would 
stand to reason that the fifth season 
could either continue meeting the 
standards of greatness the show has 
already set for itself or, understand-
ably, fail to live up to them.

It sort of ends up doing both. The 

fifth season narrows its focus more 
than any other season before it and 
tells the story of a three-day-long 
prison riot, a creative and ambitious 
move that seems to offer as many 
opportunities as it takes away. The 
restricted timeline definitely makes 
this a unique season, as the audience 
gets to see what all of their favorite 
characters would do if they were 
suddenly the ones at Litchfield with 
the power, but it also makes the show 
a 
little 
less focused and more 

jumbled.

“Orange is the 

New Black” has a 
sprawling cast of 
characters, which 
works better when 
all of their arcs 

aren’t packed into the same con-
densed, chaotic timeline. At times 
this can feel aimless, when unrelated 
scenes featuring so many different 
characters are forced into one epi-
sode. Another problem is that since 
the season encompasses such a short 
amount of time, each character’s arc 
is the same throughout; the problems 
people are dealing with in the first 
couple of episodes are largely the 
same ones they’re facing closer to the 
finale. This approach makes sense for 
a three-day-long timeline, but it also 
makes it hard to truly develop the 
characters and change them by the 
end of the season.

That being said, this is a show with 

some truly terrific characters, and 
many of them have a chance to shine 
this season. Red (Kate Mulgrew, 
“Star Trek: Voyager”) spends the sea-

son trying to get revenge on Piscatella 
(Brad William Henke, “Fury”), which 
both adds necessary tension to the 
season and pushes her into amusing 
new territory when she inadvertently 
takes speed with partner-in-revenge 
Blanca Flores (Laura Gómez). Linda 
(Beth Dover, “Life Partners”), Man-
agement & Correction Corporation’s 
oblivious and uncaring Director of 
Purchasing, poses as an inmate in 
order to stay out of trouble during 
the riot, which finally opens her eyes 
to the unlivable conditions she has 
helped to create for the inmates. Flaca 
(Jackie Cruz) and Maritza (Diane 
Guerrero, “Jane the Virgin”) use their 
newfound internet access to start 
a makeup tutorial channel on You-
Tube, which ends up providing some 
of the comedic moments that work 
best in this increasingly dark and 
twisted season.

However, the season’s true stand-

out is Taystee (Danielle Brooks, “The 
Angry Birds Movie”), whose well-
argued negotiations with MCC and 
passionate determination to make 
sure the late Poussey (Samira Wiley, 
“Nerve”) is properly honored are 
what really anchor this season and 
get at the heart of what it is trying to 
say. While other inmates are using 
their newfound power to get revenge 
on last season’s abusive guards or 
passing the time with talent shows 
and makeshift coffee shops, Taystee 
— with the help of a brilliant perfor-
mance from Brooks — is working 
hard to keep the real conversation 
centered around the gross misman-
agement of the prison. This helps 
both to keep the focus of the show 
on what is important and to make 
sure that the show treats Poussey’s 
death with the respect and attention 
it really deserves.

Season Five does face some 

struggles in its attempt to stretch a 
three-day-long riot into 13 episodes, 
particularly when it comes to keep-
ing its storylines tight and organized. 
However, part of the reason why 
this comes across as less strong is 
because “Orange is the New Black” is 
in most ways a very strong show. The 
fifth season may not entirely live up 
to the expectations left behind by the 
fourth, but it still benefits from many 
powerful performances and creative 
bits of storytelling. Perhaps most 
importantly of all, it continues its 
well-executed criticism of the innu-
merable problems that exist within 
America’s prison system, and its 
insistence that the audience consider 
the concrete ways in which those 
problems might begin to be solved.

Phoenix was nearly a decade 

ahead of the curve when they were 
releasing synthy, ’80s-inspired hits 
like “If I Ever Feel Better” and “Too 
Young” off their first album Unit-
ed in 2000. Now, almost 20 years 
later, their style has been replicated 
countless times by other musi-
cians of varying popularity. They 
were undoubtedly innovators in the 
revival of synth-pop, but pioneer-
ing a genre’s commercial comeback 
— though ’80s synth-
pop never really died 
— 
comes 
with 
its 

downsides. The sound 
that 
initially 
made 

them so fresh and 
inspired others to take 
a more synth-oriented 
approach is now stale. 
With Ti Amo, Phoenix dives deeper 
into a strictly pop, synth-laden sound 
that’s no longer as captivating as it 
was with past albums like United and 
It’s Never Been Like That.

In 2009, their decade-long sonic 

progression accumulated into a 
masterpiece: 
Wolfgang 
Amadeus 

Phoenix, an album filled with indie 
pop perfection. After releasing such 
a gem, they found themselves in a 
tough situation: Over the previous 
three albums, they fine tuned their 
sound and grew into a band capable 
of creating such a stellar album, one 
that would seem impossible to fol-
low. Like any artist following a mas-
terpiece, they would have to change 
their sound without abandoning 
what made them so influential in the 
first place. And, with other contem-
poraries imitating their style, sound-
ing original would be impossible. 
Wolfgang did wonders for indie pop; 

it also set the bar unrealistically high 
for Phoenix’s next releases.

Bankrupt!, their follow up to Wolf-

gang, was by no means a failure, even 
though it drifted away from their 
understated style of past albums. In 
my opinion, it did the whole ‘synth-
pop revival’ shtick better than most 
of their pop contemporaries like The 
1975 and Sky Ferreira. But having the 
misfortune of following a contempo-
rary classic, it failed to live up to its 
high expectations. Four years later, 
Ti Amo only drifts further away from 
their unique brand of indie pop.

Phoenix’s 
sound 
has 

always been clean and 
refined, 
staying 
organic 

and never overly processed. 
They introduced heavier 
reverb on Bankrupt!, relying 
more on complex process-
ing and studio effects. But 
on Ti Amo, these artificial 

elements play an ever bigger role and 
dominate the sound — all subtlety is 
lost. “Tuttifrutti,” one of the album’s 
catchiest tracks, begins with a flashy, 
fast-paced synth intro followed by 
Thomas Mars’s falsetto, all drenched 
in reverb and studio manipulation. 
The heavy processing works here; 
the song is naturally catchy enough 
that its inorganic sound doesn’t 
detract. But after 36 minutes, the 
dense layers of effects are bloated 
and suffocating. And by Ti Amo’s 
closer, “Telefono,” a strong song on 
its own, I found myself craving the 
simpler sound I grew to love on pre-
vious albums.

“Fior di Latte,” which has the mak-

ing of a summer chart-topper, shows 
Phoenix can still pack a ton of emo-
tion into a song. The heavy synths 
and soft vocals evoke passion, but 
Mars’s weak lyrics feel cringeworthy 
at times. He moans, “Oooooh, we’re 

meant to get it on” throughout the 
chorus, and it doesn’t feel as sexy as 
he likely intended it to be — probably 
the first time any French singer has 
been considered “not sexy.” Ti Amo’s 
lyrics flirt with themes of heartbreak 
and lust, though only at the surface, 
never really saying anything poetic. 
Mars sings on the titular track, “Love 
you! Ti amo! Je t’aime! Te quiero! / 
Open up your legs.” I’m not sure what 
he was going for here, but it’s kind of 
disgusting. He ends up sounding like 
a multilingual creep instead of an 
international lover. 

Almost every song — with a few 

exceptions, like the disappointing 
“Ti Amo” and the quiet “Via Veneto” 
— could have been a standalone sin-
gle. Individually, the songs are catchy 
and vibrant, perfect for sweaty sum-
mer nights. And this makes Ti Amo 
so conflicting; even though most of 
the songs are damn good, listening to 
Ti Amo as a whole is more laborious 
than pleasurable. When “Telefono” 
fades out underwhelmingly, I don’t 
feel the need to go back to the start 
— hearing the opener “J-Boy”’s drum 
kit intro would just irritate me, even 
though this song is pop gold.

Unlike It’s Never Been Like That 

and Wolfgang, Ti Amo isn’t a breath 
of fresh air; ultimately, it sounds like 
other contemporary pop music. It’s 
ironic to consider this a put-down, 
since they were immensely influen-
tial in shaping indie pop throughout 
this decade. Phoenix by all means 
shouldn’t be weighed down by their 
past successes. And unlike The 
Strokes, whose first album’s perfec-
tion would doom the rest of their 
discography, Phoenix has grown and 
changed throughout their career. 
But I’ll always be longing for another 
masterpiece, and I don’t think that’s 
an unfair standard to hold them to.

The trailer for “My Cousin 

Rachel” presents a twisted psy-
chological thriller crossed with a 
steamy period romance, complete 
with promising performances by 
Rachel Weisz (“Denial”) and Sam 
Claflin (“Me Before You”). For 
a lover of period romance films, 
“My Cousin Rachel” seems at first 
to be unique and intriguing in its 
suspense and mystery. However, 
the film in its entirety effective-
ly demonstrates the misleading 
power of a well-edited trailer.

The film begins with the back-

story of protagonist Philip (Claf-
lin), who was taken at an early age 
by his cousin-turned-father-figure 
Ambrose (also Claflin) and raised 
on a large estate. Close to 
Philip’s 25th birth-
day, Ambrose trav-
els to Italy where he 
falls in love with and 
marries their mutu-
al 
cousin 
Rachel 

(Weisz). Alarmingly, 
Philip soon begins to 
receive cryptic let-
ters from Ambrose 
detailing the ways 
in which Rachel is tormenting 
him; Philip goes to Italy immedi-
ately but learns that Ambrose has 
died. This all happens within the 
first 10 minutes of the film, set-
ting the precedent that Rachel 
is malicious and manipulative. 
Philip develops an acute hatred 
for Rachel, and when she trav-
els back to the estate to mourn 
Ambrose, 
the 
two 
fatefully 

meet.

The following plot involves 

Philip 
becoming 
increas-

ingly infatuated with the gor-
geous Rachel and her feminine 
charms. The opening of the film 
works as a subtle but constant 
reminder to the viewer that 
Rachel is perhaps not as inno-
cent as she appears. However, 
while it is compelling at first to 
try to look for clues that indi-
cate Rachel’s ulterior motive in 
her relationship with Philip, the 
film becomes frustratingly pre-
dictable and Rachel’s manipula-
tion becomes glaringly obvious. 
The root of this predictability 

lies in Claflin’s overwhelming 
transparency; there is absolute-
ly no subtlety to his character, 
and he thinks and acts in ways 
that are simultaneously stupid, 
self-destructive and inevitable. 
Claflin’s character exemplifies 
the ability of men to be eas-
ily manipulated by the slightest 
hint of sexuality. Philip goes so 
far as to relinquish control of 
his entire estate to Rachel after 
a few kisses and lingering glanc-
es. The lack of character depth, 
partly due to Claflin’s mediocre 
acting as well as a massive flaw 
in the story, ultimately disrupts 
the intrigue of the narrative 
and causes the film to become 
superficial and annoying in its 
predictability.

Furthermore, the film would 

have been far more 

captivating if told 
from 
Rachel’s 

perspective. 
Through Philip’s 
eyes, 
Rachel 
is 

merely 
a 
prize 

to be won by his 
mother’s 
pearls. 

But 
regardless, 

the film hints at 
the female expe-

rience in the late millennia, in 
which women had no autonomy, 
no power of ownership and were 
completely dependent on men 
for money and security. The 
only weapon in Rachel’s arsenal 
is her sexuality, and she wields 
it calculatingly. The film also 
touches on the centuries-old 
trope of women with an inti-
mate knowledge of herbs and 
their powers. Rachel makes 
Philip 
her 
“special 
brew,” 

which is clearly poison, fur-
ther emphasizing the ability 
of women to find power in the 
tools available to them while 
still acting within the confines 
of their gender. With Rachel’s 
perspective, an exploration of 
the sociopolitical landscape of 
the time as a deeper explana-
tion for her actions would have 
provided depth and complexity 
to the narrative. But with Phil-
ip as the protagonist, the film 
remains a one-dimensional and 
patriarchal spotlight on one 
man’s overwhelming stupidity.

Anti-Zika pesticide linked to slowed brain growth

By CHETALI JAIN

Daily Staff Reporter

Since the alarming incidences of 

the Zika virus in North and South 

America in 2015, efforts to study 
the formidable infectious agent 
and find ways to prevent its spread 
have intensified. Researchers at the 
University of Michigan conducted a 
study to investigate the link between 

exposure to pesticides like naled and 
chlorpyrifos — which are used to kill 
mosquitoes that could potentially 
be carrying the virus — and child 
neurodevelopment.

The virus, which is transmitted to 

humans via a mosquito vector Aedes 
aegypti, has been linked to serious 
neonatal malformations as well 
as Guillain-Barré syndrome — an 
autoimmune disease which leads 
to nerve damage and weakness in 
adults.

John Meeker, an Environmental 

Health Sciences professor in the 
School of Public Health, oversaw the 
project that built on earlier studies 
done by Betsy Lozoff, Center for 
Human Growth and Development 
professor, and her research team.

“There has been a lack of 

human research on naled, whereas 
chlorpyrifos has been more well-
studied but not for these effects 
specifically,” Meeker said.

The 
statistically 
significant 

results of the University study 
showed there were issues with 
motor skill development in infants 
that were prenatally exposed to 
the 
aforementioned 
insecticide 

chemicals. 

According to Monica Silver, a 

research fellow at the School of 
Public Health, naled exposure is 
associated with fine motor function 
deficits, 
notably 
visual-motor 

coordination, while those exposed 
to chlorpyrifos exhibited deficits in 
both gross and fine motor functions. 
Silver acknowledged the delicate 
balance between stopping the spread 
of the virus and avoiding the adverse 
effects of such preventive measures.

“Zika is a very serious public 

health threat, but this study 
highlights that the way we go 
about combating Zika and other 
vector-borne 
diseases 
needs 

to be carefully thought out in 
order to minimize unintended 
consequences,” Silver said. “One 
of the aims of my research was to 

examine the effects of prenatal 
organophosphate 
insecticide 

exposure on infant motor function.”

Currently, 
the 
U.S. 

Environmental Protection Agency 
regulates the use of both insecticide 
chemicals. Chlorpyrifos is the 
most common way to control 
agricultural pests. However, the 
United States no longer licenses 
the chemical due to its propensity 
for causing neurotoxic damage.

The study was innovative in 

its incorporation of the potential 
ecological 
effect 
to 
Lozoff’s 

study 
of 
iron 
deficiency 
and 

neurodevelopment.

“This is an example where we 

leveraged NIH funding by building 
an environmental exposure study 
on top of a nutrition study,” Lozoff 
said.

Future 
directions 
shared 

among the researchers include 
a 
shift 
toward 
studies 
that 

examine 
different 
ways 
to 

control the spread of Zika while 
simultaneously taking into account 
the unintentional costs of doing so.

“Holistic approaches addressing 

the full spectrum of the issue to 
reduce Zika-carrying mosquito 
populations, 
mosquito-human 

interactions, and mosquito bites 
should be considered in order to 
minimize both the spread of the 
virus and the amount of potentially 
harmful chemicals used,” Meeker 
said.

Investigators hope that their 

research exposing the detrimental 
effects 
of 
the 
chemicals 
on 

neonatal health will encourage 
future studies to focus on the 
impact of such pesticide usage 
on the environment and human 
health.

These are far from the only people

For Central Americans — and

and especially if it is — do not let

Straight from 

the Unicorn’s 

Mouth: 

Centering 

Central America

By PATRICK MULLEN-COYOY

Michigan in Color Contributor

To my fellow Central American 

unicorns,

As you know, it’s not easy being 

a Central American in the United 
States — it’s not easy being Latinx, 
period. But we all know that being 
Central American is a little differ-
ent.

Let’s recap: For most people in 

the United States, Central Amer-
ica stopped existing somewhere 
around the mid-90s. Why should 
we care? It’s not like a CIA-backed 
coup led to the successful over-
throw of Guatemala’s Ten Years of 
Spring, of course. And why would 
we even bother looking at El Sal-
vador or Nicaragua, where years of 
U.S. intervention lead to civil war 
and even more death? Besides, it’s 
not like refugees kept coming to 
the United States after the peace 
accords were signed! (They did.) 
With our bloodstained foot out the 
door of our past, why should any of 
this matter, anyway?

Now, you might anticipate we 

would have paid more attention 
to Central America again in 2014. 
You would have been hard-pressed 
to avoid discussing it, what with 
more than 50,000 unaccompanied 
minors fleeing conditions of vio-
lence and poverty in Honduras, 
El Salvador and Guatemala. Three 
years ago isn’t that long, right?

You would be wrong.
After the all too necessary seg-

ments on CNN that summer with 
a panic about the “crisis on the 
border,” there was … nothing. No 
one talked — talks — about these 
children anymore. Obama said 
things were fine, so they must be, 
despite the fact that fiscal year 
2016 demonstrated apprehensions 
of minors nearing those of 2014. “A 
brief spike” is how these lives were 
described.

Knowing this, you might say 

to yourself that even if the gen-
eral public doesn’t focus too much 
attention on Central Americans, 
they must be centered within 
Latina/o and Latin American 
Studies departments and cours-
es. We’re focused on all Latines, 
including Central Americans. Or 
so the assumption would go.

Unfortunately, this is far from 

the norm. In most any Latina/o 
Studies or Latin American history 
course (barring California State 
University Northridge’s special-
ized program), Central American 
history, literature, politics, culture 
and people are generally located 
somewhere in between the Cuban 
revolution and NAFTA. One class, 
mid-way through the syllabus. 
Perfunctory discussion of how 
civil war came to pass in Guate-
mala and El Salvador. Massacres. 
Refugees. Peace accords. If you’re 
lucky, maybe you’ll even read 
Rigoberta Menchú’s memoir. Then 
on to Argentina.

A bleak view, to be sure.
Nevertheless, this history of 

erasure, ignorance and invisibi-
lization is far from the end for our 
communities. If others do not care 
about Central America in the ways 
that we need, then we must do the 
work. Not for them, but for us — as 
we did before the civil wars and as 
we continue to do today. We need 
place our own testimonials, our 
own stories, our own narratives of 
heartbreak and heroism at the cen-
ter ourselves of the Americas. We 
must develop a voice for ourselves, 
not apart from the wider Latinx 
community, but in harmony with 
that louder, pan-ethnic melody.

If few outsiders are willing to 

amplify our lives, dramas, fears, 
traumas and dreams, then we 
need to do that for one another. 
We have to cultivate new soli-
darities and open ourselves up to 
messy diasporic identities. “Cen-
tral American,” “Central Ameri-
can-American” and “U.S. Central 
American” are far from all-encom-
passing terms. That said, by allow-
ing for people to voice their own 
lives and experiences as they will 
— and in whichever of the count-
less languages of Central America 
they prefer — then perhaps we can 
avoid the totalizing narratives of 
Central America that have existed 
for so long.

In large part, this work is 

already being done. Folks like Dr. 
Leisy Abrego and “Dichos de un 
bicho” use the #CentAmStudies 
tag on social media to develop an 
archive of useful news, articles

Happy 

Father’s Day

By JASON ROWLAND

Michigan in Color Managing Editor

“A ship is safe in harbor, but 

that’s not what ships are built for” 
 

-John A. Shedd 

Dad,
Oddly enough, my most pivotal 

memories of us are simple conver-
sations that meant nothing at the 
time, but mean everything today. 
The conversations that, unbe-
knownst to you (and definitely to 
me), triggered a shift in mindset 
or attitude. The conversations that 
have stuck around in my memory 
after all of these years. The conver-
sations that ended with a variation 
of “you’ll understand one day.”

One such conversation hap-

pened in your car, around what 
feels like an eternity ago to me — 
but probably feels like last month to 
you — as I listened to you describe 
a show called “The Twilight Zone” 
that you watched as a kid. As you 
went on recounting the scenes in 
one particular episode, my inter-
est rose. Aliens? Meteors? Arma-
geddon? I was hooked. Finally, my 
curiosity burst free: “Is it based on 
a true story?” I asked. Your answer 
has stuck with me since. Instead of 
simply saying no and moved on, you 
launched into a lesson about the 
importance of critical thinking. It 
quickly made sense that if we were 
discussing a show about the end of 
the world, it couldn’t be based on a 
true story — a shift in mindset that 
arose from a simple conversation.

Another time, I remember ask-

ing, “Dad, if I’m homeless when I 
grow up, will you let me live with 
you?” Much to my surprise, you 

answered no — quickly followed by 
“but you don’t have to worry about 
that.” I’m not sure why I remember 
that exchange, but I do. However, 
what’s crystal clear to me now is 
the motivation behind your answer. 
Instead of teaching me that failure 
was an option — that I don’t need 
to try — you instilled in me the les-
son of self-reliance. While today I 
know I could crash on your couch 
whenever I need to, that’s not 
what I needed to hear at the time. I 
didn’t recognize that then, but you 
did. While your answer may not 
have been what I wanted to hear, 
it’s what you knew was necessary.

Much like your incessant warn-

ings, and despite my correspond-
ing doubt, that the “one day” when 
I would understand your lessons 
would arrive sooner rather than 
later, every morning I awake to 
discover that today is the “one day” 
I heard so much about. Luckily, 
you’ve equipped me with the tools 
necessary to thrive.

All of this is to say that I am who 

I am today largely because of the 
small conversations we had many 
years ago. Perhaps it’s impossible 
for any one memory to sum up all 
of our talks. However, my memo-
ries of the following come close: 
you reminding me that you’re not 
here to “be my friend,” but you’re 
here to be my father. At the time, 
I couldn’t see why you can’t be 
both — but now I do. A friend won’t 
always be genuinely happy for us 
when we succeed; a father will. 
A friend won’t always correct us 
when we’re wrong; a father will. 
And a friend won’t always love us 
after we mess up; a father will. And 
you’ve proven this to be true time 
and time again.

Love you and happy Father’s 

Day, Jason.

Michigan well-represented in draft

The Michigan baseball team 

had 11 players selected in the 2017 
MLB Draft, which ran this week 
from Monday to Wednesday.

The 11 selections mark the 

highest the Wolverines have 
seen in program history. The 
selections also bring the total 
number of Michigan draftees up 
to 23 during Erik Bakich’s five-
year tenure as head coach.

Junior 
left-hander 
Oliver 

Jaskie was the first Wolverine off 
the board, as the Seattle Mariners 
took him in the sixth round 
with the 183rd overall pick. The 
unquestioned ace of Michigan’s 
staff this season, Jaskie finished 
the year with an 8-3 record and 
3.77 earned-run average in 16 
starts, while holding opponents 
to a .234 batting average. His 
119 strikeouts this year tied a 
Wolverine program record as 
well.

An All-Big Ten first-team 

selection, Jaskie is ranked as 
the 
147th-best 
prospect 
by 

MLB.com and the fifth-best 
college lefthander. His biggest 
strengths, according to MLB.
com, are his changeup and 
command of his fastball.

Junior third baseman Drew 

Lugbauer was the next Michigan 
player to be selected, by the 
Atlanta Braves in the 11th round. 
Lugbauer, 
an 
all-conference 

first-teamer, hit .290 with a 
team-leading 11 home runs and 
58 runs batted-in. His power to 
all fields as well as his versatility 
— he has also played catcher 
and first base as a Wolverine — 
makes him an enticing prospect.

Lugbauer was drafted for the 

second time Wednesday — he 
was selected in the 21st round by 
the Toronto Blue Jays out of high 
school, but did not sign.

In 
the 
16th 
round, 
the 

Cincinnati Reds picked junior 
right-hander Ryan Nutof. A hard 
thrower with a fastball clocked 
at around 95 miles per hour, 
Nutof was a key contributer to 
Michigan’s pitching staff all 
season long, going 6-2 with a 
4.52 ERA and 71 strikeouts. He 
worked a variety of roles for the 
Wolverines this season, making 
12 starts and four appearances 

out of the bullpen.

Senior 
catcher 
Harrison 

Wenson 
returned 
to 
school 

despite being chosen in the 39th 
round last year by the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, and improved upon that 
position this year when the Los 
Angeles Angels took him in the 
24th round. Despite slumping at 
the plate for much of the year — 
his average of .191 was a near-100 
point drop from his junior season 
— Wenson slugged nine home 
runs and was rock-solid behind 
the plate, as he allowed just nine 
passed balls and threw out 47 
percent of runners attempting to 
steal.

In 
the 
25th 
round, 
the 

Mariners drafted junior right-
hander Bryan Pall. Pall pitched 
just 2.2 innings this season 
before he was shut down due 
to injury, but recorded a 2.89 
ERA and 64 strikeouts his first 
two seasons working out of the 
bullpen, and was a Freshman 
All-American in 2015.

Junior first baseman Jake 

Bivens 
was 
drafted 
by 
the 

Detroit Tigers in the 27th round. 
Bivens, the Big Ten Freshman 
of the Year in 2015, hit .319 and 
.356 his first two seasons as a 
Wolverine. Despite his average 
falling to .273 this season, Bivens 
had an on-base percentage of 
.436 and a team-leading 24 stolen 
bases. Bivens played all across 
the infield his first two seasons, 
but featured exclusively at first 
base this year due to offseason 
Tommy 
John 
surgery 
that 

limited his throwing range.

Senior centerfielder Johnny 

Slater joined Jaskie and Pall as 
the third Mariners selection 
in the 28th round. Slater, a top 
prospect who was drafted by 
the Atlanta Braves out of high 
school, broke out in his final 
collegiate season as a true “five-
tool” player who can run, throw, 
field, hit for average and hit 
for power. A career .207 hitter 
before this year, Slater hit .299 
with five home runs, 47 RBIs, 
24 extra-base hits and 15 stolen 
bases while committing just one 
error in centerfield on his way to 
All-Big Ten Third Team honors.

The 28th round saw two 

Michigan players drafted, the 
second of which was junior left-
hander 
Michael 
Hendrickson 

by the Cleveland Indians. After 
throwing just 35.1 innings his 
first two seasons, Hendrickson 
broke out as a junior and asserted 
himself 
in 
the 
Wolverines’ 

weekend rotation, going 6-3 with 
a 4.06 ERA that ranked second 
among Michigan starters. He 
also held opponents to a mere 
.236 batting average.

The Tigers picked redshirt 

sophomore 
left-hander 
Grant 

Reuss in the 29th round. Reuss 
pitched sparingly last season, 
but impressed in that limited 
time — he allowed just one hit 
and struck out 11 in 6.2 innings.

Senior 
right-hander 
Mac 

Lozer was drafted in the 33rd 
round by the New York Mets. 
An All-Big Ten Third Team 
selection, Lozer was dominant as 
the Wolverines’ set-up man this 
season, recording a 1.00 ERA 
with 37 strikeouts in 27.0 inning 
and 
a 
miniscule 
opponents’ 

batting average of .138.

The final Michigan player 

selected was senior shortstop 
Michael Brdar, in the 36th round 
by the St. Louis Cardinals. Brdar, 
the Wolverines’ most consistent 
hitter last season, recorded a 
.310 batting average and 19 stolen 
bases. In the field, he made just 
three errors, and displayed a 
powerful throwing arm and 
terrific range in making several 
web-gem caliber defensive stops.

Five high-schoolers who have 

committed to play baseball at 
Michigan next year were also 
drafted this week. Stockton, 
Calif., right-hander Cody Bolton 
was a sixth-round pick of the 
Pirates, and The Record in 
Stockton reports that he has 
signed a professional contract 
and will forego his college 
commitment. Jason Pineda, a 
first baseman from New York, 
was selected by the San Diego 
Padres in the 17th round. Catcher 
Joe Donovan, from Westmont, 
Ill., was the 33rd-round selection 
of the Chicago Cubs, while 
Portage 
Central 
right-hander 

Jeff Criswell was drafted in 
the 35th round by the Tigers. 
Left-hander 
Angelo 
Smith, 

from Illinois, marked the final 
selection for Michigan commits, 
as he was chosen by the Chicago 
White Sox in the 40th and final 
round.

Eleven players selected in MLB Draft marks a program record

Just five years after becoming 

the head coach of the Michigan 
baseball 
team, 
Erik 
Bakich 

has completely changed the 
program’s 
trajectory, 
taking 

the Wolverines from a 22-win 
team in 2012 to their winningest 
season since 2008 last year.

With Bakich’s original five-

year 
contract 
expiring 
this 

season, the quick turnaround 
he has engineered at one of the 
nation’s most storied programs 
has tied him to high-profile job 
openings around the country, 
including the vacancies at South 
Carolina and Stanford.

However, 
it 
appears 
that 

Bakich is staying put.

D1Baseball.com’s 
Kendall 

Rogers 
first 
reported 

Wednesday evening via Twitter 
that Bakich had turned down 
the Cardinal’s offer, and was 
committed to remaining the 
head coach at Michigan. In a 
later tweet, Rogers reported 
that Bakich was not a candidate 
for the Gamecocks’ vacancy 
either.

Bakich appeared to confirm 

this 
report 
himself 
with 
a 

statement posted to his Twitter 
account approximately an hour 
later.

“Quick note to say thank you 

to Michigan, (athletic director) 
Warde Manuel, (senior associate 
athletic director) Bitsy Ritt, our 
coaches, staff, and players for 
allowing me to continue to wear 
the block ‘M’,” Bakich wrote. “It 
is an honor and privilege to serve 
as the head baseball coach. We 
have so much to be proud of in our 
151 year tradition rich program 
and the future continues to be 
extremely bright. Those who stay 
will be champions. Thank you 
and Go Blue!”

The Detroit News had reported 

earlier this week that Manuel 
had offered Bakich a five-year 
contract extension to continue as 
the Wolverines’ coach.

Bakich coached at Maryland 

for three seasons, recording a 
record of 70-98, before taking the 
job at Michigan. In his five seasons 
in Ann Arbor, the Wolverines 
have gone 176-119, including a 
70-49 record in conference play, 
and have qualified for the NCAA 
Tournament twice, including an 
automatic bid for winning the 
Big Ten Conference tournament 
in 2015.

Wolverines compete at national meet

The Michigan track and field teams 

sent eight athletes in total — five men 
and three women — to compete at 
the NCAA Outdoor Championships 
last week in Eugene, Ore. from 
Wednesday to Saturday.

While the Wolverines weren’t as 

well-represented as they were last 
year, when six men and five women 
qualified for the national meet, they 
made their presences count with 
three All-American honors and an 
individual national championship.

The women’s team finished 21st 

overall with 10 points, and the men 
placed 41st with a score of six.

The highlight of the competition 

for Michigan was the performance 
of junior Jaimie Phelan, who won 
the 1,500-meter run to become the 
Wolverines’ first national champion 
in that event.

Phelan began the race in last place 

out of 12 runners, and spent most of 
the race there. But she flew into the 
lead with 200 meters to go, and with 
a blistering final lap of 61.62 seconds, 
she held off Arkansas’s Nikki Hiltz 
by two-hundredths of a second — 
4:13.78 seconds to 4:13.80 — to win the 
second-closest final in NCAA history.

The Ontario native won All-

American honors for a second straight 
year after she finished eighth in 2016, 
and caps off the year having won the 
Big Ten and NCAA championships in 
the 1,500 meters.

“(It hasn’t sunk in) yet, honestly,” 

Phelan said. “It won’t hit for a while, 
for sure. I think there’s still a lot to 
accomplish — after this season, the 
next big thing is to get ready for (cross-

country). It’s been an unbelievable 
year.”

Michigan was also represented 

in the 3,000-meter steeplechase 
by junior Claire Borchers. After a 
second-place finish at the Big Ten 
Championships and a victory in 
the NCAA Preliminary Round two 
weeks ago, Borchers recorded a time 
of 10:07.35 in the semifinals Thursday 
— good enough for an honorable 
mention All-American nod, but not 
enough to qualify her for the final.

Senior Gina Sereno, who swept 

the 5,000 and 10,000 meter races at 
the conference championships last 
month, put her undefeated record for 
the season on the line Saturday night 
in the 5,000 meters. Sereno asserted 
herself in the lead pack for the first 
half of the race, but with just under a 
mile to go, she fell off that pace and 
slipped to 15th, with a time of 16:03.55.

The men’s team has been able to 

count on its throwing contingent for 
consistent results this season, and 
the NCAA Championships were no 
different. Wednesday, sophomore Joe 
Ellis — the 2017 Big Ten champion 
and the program record holder in the 
hammer throw — placed eighth in 
that event with a toss of 70.33 meters 
to finish eighth, which marked the 
Wolverines’ highest finish in the 
hammer throw since 1933.

Ellis had the longest throw of 

any eighth-place finisher in history, 
a testament to the quality of the 
competition.

Ellis was joined in the throwing 

events by junior Grant Cartwright and 
freshman Andrew Liskowitz, who 
finished 22nd and 23rd, respectively, 
in the shot put to grab honorable 
mention All-American nods.

Senior decathlete Steven Bastien 

closed out his Michigan career with 
a fourth-place finish in the decathlon. 
Powered by five personal-bests, he 
recorded a score of 8,015 — breaking 
his own program record.

Bastien’s impressive finish may 

have been most surprising to Bastien 
himself. Injuries early in the year 
threatened to derail his season, but he 
instead will leave Michigan with All-
American honors to his name, as well 
as a Big Ten championship.

“I just want to thank God, because 

I didn’t see this happening,” Bastien 
said. “I sort of imagined that I could, 
but I just feel blessed to be able to 
come to this school and have the 
people around me that I had around 
me to push me to this and to help me 
achieve this type of thing.”

Bastien set personal records in 

the 110-meter hurdles, 100-meters, 
400-meters, high jump and pole 
vault. His high jump success might 
have been the most unexpected, 
and because of this was the most 
satisfying for him.

“As far as the whole injury thing 

went, that was what was really setting 
me back,” Bastien said. “Something 
about the way I was taking off was just 
really making my knee aggravated. 
To have an outdoor PR, wasn’t really 
expecting that at all.”

Sophomore Taylor McLaughlin 

was the Wolverines’ sole running 
representative, in the 400-meter 
hurdles. After a first-team All-
American 
debut 
last 
season, 

McLaughlin was unable to advance 
out of the semifinals, but ran a season-
best time of 50.18 seconds to be named 
to the second team.

Jabrill Peppers was announced as Michigan’s 2016-2017 Male Athlete of the Year.

Peppers, Minor named 
Athletes of the Year

Monday, the University of 

Michigan Athletic Department 
announced its 2016-17 male and 
female Athletes of the Year: 
Jabrill Peppers (football) and 
Brienne Minor (women’s tennis). 
The honor has not gone to either 
sport since Braylon Edwards 
won for football in 2005.

The award puts Peppers and 

Minor in contention for the Big 
Ten Athletes of the Year, the 
winners of which are ultimately 
determined by a media vote. 
The last Michigan athlete to 
win was Peter Vanderkaay in 
2006 for men’s swimming and 
diving.

Peppers was the swiss-army 

knife for the nation’s leading 
defense, playing 15 different 
positions for the Wolverines en 
route to becoming a Heisman 
award finalist and All-American 
candidate. 
His 
impressive 

on-field play and accolades made 
him the 25th overall pick in the 
2017 NFL Draft to the Cleveland 
Browns, where he was drafted as 
a safety.

Peppers’ 
all-around 
talent 

earned him the Paul Hornung 
Award 
for 
being 
the 
most 

versatile 
player 
in 
college 

football, and healso won the 
Nagurski-Woodson 
Defensive 

Player of the Year, the Butkus-
Fitzgerald Linebacker of the 
Year and the Rodgers-White 
Return Specialist of the Year. 
Peppers finished the season 
with 72 tackles, four sacks, one 
interception 
and 
one 
return 

touchdown, and his presence was 
a constant threat for opposing 
offenses. 

Minor made headlines as the 

first athlete in the Michigan 
women’s 
tennis 
program’s 

history 
to 
win 
a 
national 

championship, doing so in a 
miracle tournament run for the 
2017 NCAA singles title over 
No. 6 Belinda Woolcock. The 
rising junior entered the NCAA 
Tournament unseeded, ranked 
below fellow Wolverine Kate 
Fahey. Minor rallied for six 
consecutive wins — dropping 
just two sets along the way — to 
clinch the title. 

Minor ended her championship 

season ranked ninth by the ITA 
with a 33-6 singles record for 
her 
second 
consecutive 
All-

American 
honors 
in 
singles 

and a unanimous All-Big Ten 
selection. She also finished 19-5 
in dual matches.

Phelan wins national championship

Last November at the NCAA 

Cross Country Championships, 
Michigan’s Jaimie Phelan was 
barely edged at the finish line by 
Oregon’s 
Maggie 
Schmaedick, 

who claimed 64th place by 0.1 
seconds 
over 
the 
Wolverine 

junior.

Neither runner had any way 

of knowing it as they crossed the 
line, but that tenth-of-a-second 
difference between Schmaedick 
and Phelan gave the Ducks the 
team title, with a score of 125 
points to Michigan’s 126.

Fast forward to the 1,500-

meter run at the NCAA Outdoor 
Track and Field Championships 
in Eugene, Ore. last Saturday. 
With one lap to go, Phelan sat in 
last place — not exactly a desirable 
position 
when 
taken 
out 
of 

context. But with such a tight lead 
pack — just .68 seconds separated 
her from the front — she knew she 
was far from out of it.

“It was a pretty tight pack, 

and at that point I just knew that 
I have to get out,” Phelan said. 
“Once I got out then I saw a clear 
path and just decided to go with 
it.”

Seeing her opportunity, Phelan 

shot all the way into the lead on 
the backstretch. She maintained 
this slim advantage into the final 
100 meters, even as Arkansas’s 
Nikki Hiltz closed quickly behind 
her.

“I know as soon as I started 

feeling 
someone 

on my shoulder I 
just wanted to dig 
a little bit deeper 
and keep the legs 
rolling and finish 
stronger,” Phelan 
said.

She 
did 
just 

that — and this 
time, 
Phelan 

was on the right 
side 
of 
another 

impossibly 
close 

finish.

Two-hundredths of a second — 

the second-narrowest margin of 
victory in NCAA championship 
history.

With a time of 4:13.78, the 

junior from Kitchener, Ontario 
became the Michigan women’s 
track and field team’s first-ever 
national champion in the 1,500 
meters.

“Definitely took a moment (to 

realize),” Phelan said. “I wasn’t 
quite sure — I looked over and 
I saw Nikki Hiltz and a couple 
girls out of the corner of my eye to 
the right. Once I looked up to the 
screen, then I knew and it kind 
of sunk in a little bit, but it’s still 
somewhere in disbelief.”

Phelan earned All-American 

honors in the 1,500 last year with 
her eighth-place finish and won 
the Big Ten championship in that 
event last month. 
But 
with 
three 

former 
national 

champions 
in 

Saturday’s 
final 

field, she wasn’t 
exactly among the 
biggest 
favorites 

to win.

However, 

Phelan knew that 
depending 
on 

how the race was 
run, she’d have a chance. She 
would likely have a tougher time 
contending if the pace at first 
was quick — her personal best 
is slower than all but two of her 
opponents — but a steady, tactical 
race would play right into her 
hands and allow her to use the 
speed she had developed from the 
800-meter training of her youth.

Phelan had already utilized 

this “sit-and-kick” strategy at the 
Big Ten Championships. After 
the first 1,100 meters were run 
at around 70 seconds per lap, she 
covered the last 400 meters in 
62 seconds to pull away and win 

the title. However, 
she expected that 
Saturday’s 
race 

would start out 
faster, making this 
strategy tougher.

“I was definitely 

expecting it to go 
out really fast. I 
was ready for a 
fast race,” Phelan 
said. “(Saturday), 
it 
just 
seemed 

more tactical. It 

was anyone’s race.”

So when the field cruised 

through the first 700 meters at 
a controlled pace of just over 
two minutes, Phelan was able to 
remain mostly calm and composed 
despite running at the back of the 
pack for much of the race.

“Going into the race I think 

with the speed in the last 200 and 
the last lap I really like to give it 

everything and just focus on those 
gear changes,” Phelan said. “I’m 
always ready for anything in a 
race, but (a tactical race) definitely 
plays into my favor more.”

Phelan’s tactics were executed 

to perfection. As the bell rang, 
signifying the final lap, it was 
clear that the race would come 
down to a test of speed.

And here, no one could match 

Phelan. She ran the last 400 
meters in a blazing 1:01.62 — 

even faster than 
at the Big Ten 
championships, 
and tops in the 
field by over half a 
second.

Phelan’s victory 

marked the fifth 
year in a row that 
the 
Wolverines 

have had an All-
American in the 
1,500 meters — the 

longest such streak in the country. 
Not only is she now a back-to-back 
All-American, but she also follows 
in the footsteps of previous 
teammates and past Michigan 
greats such as Shannon Osika and 
fellow Canadian Nicole Sifuentes.

Phelan 
praised 
both 
Osika 

and Sifuentes after the race, 
along with assistant coach Mike 
McGuire for his work with the 
Wolverines’ distance corps.

“Ever since freshman year for 

me coming into Michigan I’ve 
had some unbelievable training 
partners,” Phelan said. “Shannon 
Osika last year coming in 4th in 
the NCAA 1,500 — she’s been an 
unbelievable role model for me as 
well as Nicole Sifuentes. Nicole’s 
also Canadian so she’s always 
been a role model for me growing 
up. Just seeing how hard they 
work and having them by all of our 
team’s sides just helps enormously 
to keep us all together.”

And 
Saturday, 
Phelan 

accomplished 
something 
that 

neither Osika or Sifuentes — or 
any other 1,500-meter runner 
in Wolverine history — had ever 
done.

She 
became 
a 
national 

champion.

“I’m beyond grateful for all 

the support I’ve had at Michigan 
and with my friends all over and 
the messages that I’ve gotten 
this 
weekend 
and 
this 
past 

year and through all my time at 
Michigan,” Phelan said. “It’s been 
unbelievable.”

“I saw a clear 
path and just

with it”
