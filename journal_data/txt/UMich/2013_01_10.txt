By PETER SHAHIN and
TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily News Editors
University Provost Philip
Hanlon announced Wednesday
afternoon the appointment of
Mark West as the Law School's
17th dean.
West's assignment contin-
ues a longstanding tradition of
appointing Law School deans
from within the University. West
is currently the associate dean
for academic affairs at the Law
School and the Nippon Life Pro-
fessor of Law.
"Mark West brings to -the
deanship the valued strengths of
brilliant scholarship'and strong
academic administration," Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man said in a statement. "His
overall expertise and insight
make Mark an exceptional choice
to lead one of the nation's pre-

mier legal education programs."
West joined the Law School
in 1998 as an assistant professor.
Since, he has served as director
of the U-M Center for Japanese
Studies as well as director of the
Law School's Center for Interna-
tional and Comparative Law. His
expertise is in criminal and Japa-
nese law.
West earned his law degree
from Columbia University School
of Law, where he was an editor
for the Columbia Law Review.
During his time at Columbia, he
focused on Japanese law in prep-
aration for a career in academia,
and has since written five books
on Japanese culture and law.
West earned his bachelor's
degree from Rhodes College. He
also studied and taught at the
University of Tokyo and Kyoto
University in Japan. He has also
been honored as a Fulbright
Scholar, an Abe Fellow and a fel-
low of the Japan Society for Pro-
motion of Science.

director of bands at
Western Mich.

Scott Boerma, Marching
Band director and an associ-
ate professor of conducting,
resigned Tuesday evening to
assume the position of direc-
tor of bands at his alma mater,
Western Michigan University
in Kalamazoo, Mich.

Ina statement on the March-
ing Band's Facebook page,
University Director of Bands
Michael Haithcock announced
the resignation and wished
Boerma well.
"Today Professor Scott
Boerma announced his resig-
nation as Director of the Michi-
gan Marching Band to students
in their post-bowl wrap up
meeting," Haithcock said.
"Dr. Boerma is leaving UM to
take his 'dream job' as Direc-
tor of Bands at his alma mater,
Western Michigan University.
While we are all very sad Pro-
fessor Boerma will leave us, we
are thrilled his dream has come
true."

In an interview Wednes-
day, Boerma said he decided to
announce his decision early in
the semester so the band has a
plan in place to move forward.
"It is our highest priority to
make sure (the transition) is
smooth for the students," Boer-
ma said.
Boerma will continue to lead
the Marching Band until the
end of the semester. He will
begin his position at WMU in
August.
Haithcock said in an inter-
view he has not yet named
Boerma's replacement.
"He was just offered the
job at Western Michigan right
around the holidays so there is a

bunch of institutional steps we
have to go through to consider
(his replacement)," Haithcbck
said. "Because it's the first day
of school we have not been able
to get very far in the process."
Boerma's dedication to
the program was evident in
remarks from his students
regarding his departure.
LSA junior Zach Salander,
a horn player, expressed his
gratitude for all that.Boerma
has done for both him and the
program. .. .
"He will truly be missed. He
helped me make my dreams
come true, and I will always be
thankful for that. It was always

The University's Information
Technology Council - a group
of professors, administrators
and staff members that develop

IT policy for the University - is
striving to enhance its reputa-
tion through a two-year-old
initiative called NextGen Michi-
gan, which plans to reduce the
costs of IT services for the Uni-
versity while simultaneously
improving its overall service.
ITC is working to consolidate
many services, such as serv-
ers, data, e-mailing and storage,
to cut costs, avoid redundancy
and provide a better service for

everyone, according to Laura
Patterson, the University's Chief
Information Officer.
"We're building a shared
service where many people can
come together and provide a
service to everyone on campus,"
Patterson said. "In doing that,
you are able to both drive down
the cost efficiently and improve
the service overall that's being
provided to everyone."

By RACHEL PREMACi(

No resolution was reached
yesterday during a conference
between the Ann Arbor Tran-

resident Blaine Coleman in
an endless battle over AATA's
decision not to post Coleman's

advertisement featuring anti-
Israeli sentiments on their

The two-year-old case con-

Judge Mark Goldsmith makes

In January of 2011, Cole-

space on the side of an Ann
Arbor bus. The ad had many
images of skulls accompanied
by the words "Boycott Israel".

The AATA rejedted the adver-
tisement, asserting that the
advertisement violated two
provisions of its policy: that
the advertisement be in "good
taste" and that it "not contain
any scorn or ridicule".
However, in September 2012
Goldsmith ruled that AATA's

stitutional. Coleman, however,
sought further relief, arguing

Hagel details stance on Iran'

Sec. of Defense
nominee claims his
views have been
misrepresented
WASHINGTON (AP) -
President Barack Obama's pick
for defense secretary, Chuck
Hagel, is meeting with senior
Pentagon staff to try to set the
record straight about his stand
on Iran, saying he backs strong
international sanctions against
Tehran and believes all options,
including military action,

should be on the table, defense
officials said Wednesday.
In private meetings with
top military and defense lead-
ers and staff this week, Hagel
sought to counter critics who
say he is soft on Iran and would
be the most antagonistic sec-
retary toward Israel. Senior
defense officials who have met
with Hagel said he told them
that his views on Iran have
been misrepresented and that
he has long backed internation-
al sanctions.
Hagel, a former Republican
senator from Nebraska, has
been given space on the Pen-

tagon's third floor and a small
staff so he can begin preparing
for what will likely be a conten-
tious Capitol Hill hearing on
his nomination.
Already this week, Hagel
has had dinner and lunch with
Defense Secretary Leon Panet-
ta and met with Joint Chiefs
Chairman Martin Dempsey
and Deputy Defense Secretary
Ashton Carter. He also has
begun making calls to senators
to answer questions and lay out
his positions on key national
security issues.
Critics have zeroed in on
statements Hagel has made
questioning the wisdom of a
military strike by either the
U.S. or Israel against Iran.
As a senator, he voted against
unilateral economic sanc-
tions on Tehran, although he
supports the joint interna-
tional penalties Obama also
prefers. Hagel also irritated
some Israel backers with
his reference to the "Jewish
lobby" in the United States.
A handful of Republi-
can senators, including Sen.
Pat Roberts, R-Kan., have
already announced opposi-
tion to their former GOP col-
league, and some Democrats
have expressed unease with
the choice. But it is likely
that, in the end, senators will

Passengers launched
into walls, down
stairwells on impact
NEW YORK (AP) - A high-
speed ferryloaded with hundreds
of commuters from New Jer-
sey crashed into a dock in lower
Manhattan on Wednesday dur-
ing the morning rush hour, seri-
ously injuring11people, including
one who suffered a severe head
wound falling down a stairwell.
Scores of people who had
been standing, waiting to disem-
bark, were hurled to the deck or
launched into wallsby the impact,
which came after the catamaran
Seastreak Wall Street slowed fol-
lowing a routine trip across New
York Bay and past the Statue of
Liberty, passengers said.
"We were pulling into the
dock. The boat hit the dock. We
just tumbled on top of each other.
I got thrown into everybody else.
... People were hysterical; cry-
ing," said Ellen Foran, of Nep-
tune City, N.J.
The crash, which ripped open
a small part of the hull like an
aluminum can, happened at
8:45 a.m. at a pier near the South
Street Seaport, at Manhattan's

southern tip. Around 70 people
suffered minor injuries, and for
nearly two hours paramedics
treated bruised and dazed pas-
sengers on the pier. Firefighters
carried several patients on flat-
board stretchers as a precaution.
Other patients left in wheel-
chairs.
The cause of the crash was
under investigation. The ferry,
built in 2003, had recently
undergone a major overhaul that
gave it new engines and a new
propulsion system, but officials
said it was too soon to tell wheth-
er they played any role in what
happened.
Dee Wertz, who was on
shore waiting for the ferry, saw
the impact. She said that just
moments before the ferry hit,
she had been having a conversa-
tion with a ferry employee about
how the boat's captains had been
complaining lately about its
maneuverability.
"He was telling me that none
of these guys like this boat," she
said. "It was coming in a little
wobbly. It hit the right side of
the boat nl the dock hard, like a
bomb."
James Barker, the chairman
of the ferry's owner, Seastreak
LLC, said at a news conference

hours after the crash it was "a
terrible day for all of us."
"We are simply shocked and
stunned that this happened," he
said, adding that the company
would work with investigators
from the National Transporta-
tion Safety Board to determine
what went wrong. "Our priority
continues to be the people who
are injured."
About 330 passengers and
crew members were aboard the
ferry, which had arrived from
Atlantic Highlands, a part of the
Jersey Shore still struggling to
recover from Superstorm Sandy.
Passenger Frank McLaughlin,
whose home was filled with 5
feet of water in the late October
storm, said he was thrown for-
ward and wrenched his knee.
"We come in and do this every
day, and so it just kind of glides
in," he said. "It came in hard,
and it was just a huge impact as
we hit."
Some passengers were blood-
ied when they banged into walls
and toppled to the floor, he said.
New York City's transpor-
tation commissioner, Janette
Sadik-Khan, said the ferry was
coming in at 10 to 12 knots, or
about12 to 14 mph, when itstruck
one slip and then hit a second.

Giant squid
captured on video
in ocean depths
After years of searching, sci-

have captured video images of a
giant squid in its natural habitat
deep in the ocean for the first
time.
The three-meter (nine-foot)
invertebrate was filmed from a
manned submersible during one
of 100 dives in the Pacific last
summer in a joint expedition
by Japanese public broadcaster
NHK, Discovery Channel and
Japan's National Museum of
Nature and Science.
NHK released photographs of
the giant squid this week ahead
of Sunday's show about the
encounter. The Discovery Chan-
nel will air its program on Jan.
27.
The squid, which was inex-
plicably missing its two longest
tentacles, was spotted in waters
east of Chichi Island about 1,000
kilometers (600 miles) south of
Tokyo, NHK said. The crew fol-
lowed it to a depth of 900 meters
(2,950 feet).

Leaders to address
the city's 30,000
vacant homes
DETROIT (AP) -.A 50-year
blueprint for revitalizing
Detroit, from leveling parts of
nearly vacant neighborhoods
for parks to relaxing rules
for startup companies, was
released Wednesday after two
years of research and commu-
nity input.
The project was launched by
Mayor Dave Bing, who joined
dozens of community, busi-
ness and philanthropic leaders
in unveiling the plan for the
shrinking and financially trou-
bled city. The 349-page'strate-
gic framework focuses on job
growth, land use, improving
neighborhoods and rebuilding
infrastructure.
It doesn't include financing
plans, but at least $150 million
in initial funding will come
over the next five years from
the Kresge Foundation. The
private organization, which is
based in nearby Troy, has long
been active in Detroit-area
projects.
"It became clear to me that
business as usual would not
effectively transform our
city, and a new framework for
Detroit's future needed to be
developed," Bing said Wednes-
day.
"As mayor of Detroit and
a long-time member of this
community, I've witnessed the
steady decline of a city with
so much promise," said Bing, a
former NBA star and success-
ful businessman in Detroit.
"I'm convinced Detroit can be a
world-class city again."
A major focus is on Detroit's
ramshackle neighborhoods.
The city - which lost a quar-
ter-million people in the last
decade - currently has at least

30,000 empty homes and 20
square miles of vacant land.
Among the report's sug-
gestions are targeting vacant
land and empty buildings for
employment districts to stimu-
late job growth in neighbor-
hoods. It also recommends
encouraging residents living
in sparsely populated neigh-
borhoods to move out, then
converting the land into open
space or community gardens.
Officials said no residents
would be left behind, though
no mechanism is in place to pay
people in those neighborhoods
to move to more stable areas of
the city.
The report doesn't include
specific timelines for projects.
For example, it suggests that
zoning, land use, and other
policies and rules "must be
realigned" within the next five
years to help the city stabilize
some neighborhoods.
But organizers say the report
is intended to be a guide for
current and future city leaders.
It's the culmination of coop-
erative work by city residents,
business owners and others.
"The full potential of this
framework will only be real-

Woman who shot intruder
inspires gun control foes.

Ga. resident uses
personal handgun
to protect family
against burglar
LOGANVILLE, Ga. (AP) -
A Georgia mother who shot an
intruder at her home has become
a small part of the roaring gun
control debate, with some fire-
arms enthusiasts touting her as a
textbook example of responsible
gun ownership.
Melinda Herman grabbed
a handgun and hid in a crawl
space with her two children
when a man broke in last week
and approached the family at
their home northeast of Atlanta,
police said. Herman called her
husband on the phone, and with
him reminding her of the lessons
she recently learned at a shoot-
ing range, Herman opened fire,
seriously wounding the burglary
suspect.
The National Rifle Association
tweeted a link to a news story
about the shooting, and support
poured in from others online,
hailing Herman as a hero. The
local sheriff said he was proud
of the way she handled the situ-
ation.
"This lady decided that she
wasn't going to be a victim, and
I think everyone else looks at this
and hopes they have the cour-
age to do what she done," Wal-
ton County Sheriff Joe Chapman
said Wednesday.
Herman was working from

home Friday when she saw a man
walk up to the front door. She
told police he rang the doorbell
twice and then over and over
again. He went back to his SUV,
got something out and walked
back toward the house, a police
report said.
Herman took her 9-year-
old son and daughter into an
upstairs bedroom and locked
the door. They went into bath-
room and she locked that door,
too. She got her handgun from
a safe, the report said, and hid
with her children. At some
point, she called her husband,
who kept her on the line and
called 911 on another line.
In a 10-minute 911 recording
released by the Walton County
Sheriff's Office, Donnie Herman
calmly explained what was hap-
pening to a dispatcher. His part
of the conversation with his wife
was also recorded.
"Is he in the house, Melinda?
Are you sure? How do you know?
You can hear him in the house?"
Donnie Herman said.
His wife told him the intruder
was coming closer.
"He's in the bedroom? Shh,
shh, relax. Just remember every-
thing that I showed you, every-
thing that I taught you, all right?"
Donnie Herman told his wife,
explaining later to the dispatcher
that he had recently taken her to
a gun range.
It wasn't clear from the
recording exactly when they
went to range and Donnie Her-
man told The Associated Press
on Wednesday the family didn't

want to talk about the shooting.
After Donnie Herman told his
wife police were on the way, he
started shouting: "She shot him.
She's shootin' him. She's shootin'
him. She's shootin' him. She's
shootin' him."
"OK," the dispatcher respond-
ed.
"Shoot him again! Shoot him!"
Donnie Herman yelled. He told
the dispatcher he heard a lot of
screaming, but he seems to get
increasingly worried when he
doesn't hear anything from his
wife.
Melinda Herman told police
she started shooting the man
when he opened the door to the
crawl space. The man pleaded
with her to stop, but she kept
firing until she had emptied her
rounds, she told police. She then
fled to a neighbor's house with
her children.
The man drove away in his
SUV. Police found the SUV on
another subdivision street and
discovered a man bleeding from
his face and body in a nearby
wooded area. Police identified
the suspect as 32-year-old Paul
Slater of Atlanta.
Chapman said the hospital
asked him not to comment on
Slater's condition, but he said
he is not certain Slater will sur-
vive. Authorities have a warrant
but haven't formally arrested
Slater yet. They plan to charge
him with burglary, possession
of tools for the commission of
a crime and aggravated assault,
Walton County sheriff's Capt.
Greg Hall said.

Unusual snow,
rain and wind
disrupt daily life
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -
The fiercest winter storm to hit
the Mideast in years brought a
rare foot of snow to Jordan on
Wednesday, caused fatal acci-
dents in Lebanon and the West
Bank, and disrupted traffic on
the Suez Canal in Egypt. At least
eight people died across the
region.
In Lebanon, the Red Cross
said storm-related accidents
killed six people over the past
two days. Several drowned after
slipping into rivers from flooded
roads, one person froze to death
and another died after his car
went off a slippery road, accord-
ing to George Kettaneh, Opera-
tions Director for the Lebanese
Red Cross.
In the West Bank town of
Ramallah, a Palestinian offi-
cial said two West Bank women
drowned after their car was
caught in a flash flood on Tues-
day. Nablus Deputy Governor
Annan Atirah said the women
abandoned their vehicle after it
got stuck on a flooded road, and
their bodies were apparently
swept away by surging waters.
Their driver was hospitalized in
critical condition.
In the Gaza Strip, civil defense
spokesman Mohammed al-Haj
Yousef said storms cut electric-
ity to thousands of Palestinian
homes and rescuers were sent to
evacuate dozens of people.
Parts of Israel were bracing
for snow a day after the military
was forced to send helicopters
and rubber dinghies to rescue
residents stranded by flood-
waters. In Jerusalem,' streets
were mostly empty as light
snow began to stick Wednes-
day night. School was canceled
for the next day because of the
weather, which Israeli meteo-
rologists said was the stormiest
in a decade.
The unusual weather over
the past few days hit vulnerable

Syrian refugees living in tent
camps very hard, particularly
some 50,000 sheltering in the
Zaatari camp in Jordan's north-
ern desert. Torrential rains over
four days have flooded some 200
tents and forced women and
infants to evacuate in tempera-
tures that dipped below freez-
ing at night, whipping wind and
lashingrain.
"It's been freezing cold and
constant rain for the past four
days," lamented Ahmad Tobara,
44, who evacuated his tent when
its shafts submerged in flood
water in Zaatari. A camp spokes-
man said that by Wednesday,
some 1,500 refugees had been
displaced within the camp and
were now living in mobile homes
normally used for schools.
Weather officials said winds
exceeded 45 miles (70 kilome-
ters) per hour and the rain left
two feet (70 centimeters) of
water on the streets.
The storm dumped at least
a' foot of snow on many parts
of Jordan and was accompa-
nied by lashing wind, lightning
and thunder. It shut schools,
stranded motorists and delayed
international flights, Jorda-
nian weatherman Mohammed
Samawi said. The unusually
heavy snowfall blocked streets
in the capital Amman and iso-
lated remote villages, prompt-
ing warnings from authorities
for people to stay home as snow
plows tried to reopen clogged
roads. It forced atleast 400 fami-
lies to evacuate their homes and
move to government shelters
overnight.
Samawi called it the "fiercest
storm to hit the Mideast in the
month of January in at least 30
years."
The snowstorm followed four
days of torrential rain, which
caused, flooding in many areas
across the country.
In Lebanon, several days of
winds and heavy rain along the
coast and record snow in the
mountains caused power out-
ages across the country, blocked
traffic and shut down mountain
passes.

Only part of the equation
Calculation of colleges' rankings are flawed
The University of Michigan is ranked 29th in the 2012-2013
U.S. News and World Report. While changes in these annu-
al rankings regularly bring both praise and concern, the
importance placed on the calculated numbers is often undue. Cur-
rent ranking systems like that of the U.S. News and World Report
raise questions of both universities distorting statistics and the
reports' own calculation mechanisms. College rankings are by and
large flawed, and fail to adequately capture many aspects of high-
er education. Until ranking systems are improved, administrators
and students should be wary of putting much consideration into a
school's ranking.

We can't even address our dystopian
present because some of us are afraid of
some dystopian future."
- Jon Stewart, host of The Daily Show, said during his show
Tuesday night regarding gun control.
Effort creates success .not race

Under the current U.S. News ranking meth-
od, schools are blindly rewarded for spending
more per student - even if that increase in
spending doesn't reflect a higher quality edu-
cation. When a university, for example, spends
millions on creating state-of-the-art fitness
centers, their ranking could get a hefty boost.
However, certain cost-cutting behaviors, even
those that benefit the university as a whole,
may decrease a school's score.
According to University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald, over the past decade the Uni-
versity has worked on controlling costs on
behind-the-scene expenses, such as effi-
cient building maintenance. Though con-
solidation of heating and cooling systems
saved the University money on non-academ-
ic expenditures, freeing more funding for
educational spending, the U.S. News noted
this cost cutting as simply a drop in spend-
ing per student. Such ranking systems thus
tend to overlook efficient spending, reward-
ing indiscriminate expenses over innova-
tion and smart downsizing.
Administrators can also manipulate the
numbers to inflate their university's standing,
misrepresenting the validity of the rankings..
In 2012, officials at both Claremont McKenna
College in California and Emory University
in Georgia admitted to inflating test scores
of their incoming freshman classes in their

own university's admission reports. Despite
the schools' acknowledgement of these fab-
rications, the U.S. News and World Report
rankings did not adjust for the inflated SAT
scores. In other words, falsified test scores
didn't reduce the ranking of these colleges.
This policy sets a precedent for administra-
tors that rewards dishonesty with status.
The U.S. News system also includes an
administrative rank. University officials rank
other schools based on academic reputation
on a scale of one to five, or "don't know" if the
administrator is unfamiliar with the institu-
tion. However, this academic reputation does
not necessarily correlate with a better educa-
tion. Ivy League schools, which usually top
the U.S. News list, have the benefit of name
recognition. Smaller and newer institutions,
regardless of their instructional quality, are
at a disadvantage when trying to improve
their own ranking. In this, way, such rank-
ings are often static, and don't capture lesser-
known schools accurately.
Though college rankings offer a conve-
nient measure to compare schools, such cal-
culations leave out several key factors, such
as atmosphere and community engagement,
while overemphasizing general spending
and reputation. Students and administrators
should exercise caution when taking these
numbers into account.

A pplying to college is a
stressful process, to say the
least. Applying to graduate
school - per-
haps even more
so. As students,
we do all that
we can to make
sure we have the.
most appealing
application --
the GPA, the test
scores, the extra- HARSHA
curriculars and NAHATA
the work expe-
rience. And just
when we think we've mastered the
application process, colleges throw
out another curveball.
Lately it seems to be race.
Over break I saw an article in
The New York Times claiming that
Asians may be "too smart for their
own good." Those who indicate
Asian as their ethnicity on their
applications may be at a disadvan-
tage when it comes to Ivy League
schools. Studies show that Amer-
ica's college-age Asian population
doubled between 1992 and 2011, but
the percentage of Asian Americans
enrolled at Harvard dropped by 50
percent simultaneously. In ,1992,
the Justice Department halted an
investigation accusing Harvard of
discriminating against Asians in
the application process.
During this time, Asians have
continued to make up 40 to 70
percent of the student population
at top public high schools. And a
2009 study of about 9,000 students
applying to highly selective univer-
sities showed that white students
were about three times as likely
to be admitted as Asians with the
same statistics.
This is a problem on many levels.
For one, the United States is largely
a meritocracy. The quintessential
American motto is that if you work
hard enough, you will be rewarded.
If students are working equally as
hard, it only logically follows that
they should be judged on the merit
of their applications.
But there's a bigger issue here. As

a society, we have come to associ-
ate race with academic ability andl
intellect. Race isn't a factor that4
inherently makes someone smarter
or more capable than another. Yes,
race may determine social, eco-
nomic, and cultural factors that can
impact ability and achievement.
But in that case it is those factors at
play, not race..
Which brings me to my next
point - being Asian doesn't make
you smart. We've all done it. We'vei
all seen someone that is Asian andj
classified them as a "genius." We'vei
walked into libraries full of Asiansi
and shook our heads at how roboti-i
cally they solve math and physics;
problems. We've groaned at the+
Asian kid in our classes that seemsi
to know every answer and always
throws off the curve. Even I have,+
and I identify myself as Asian.
But this is a huge misconception
- one that contributes to the ste-
reotyping and discrimination that+
we see. Asians aren't some natural+
super-species. The fact that they.
are Asian isn't what makes them
successful. They don't top academic
records because of some mysteri-
ous genetic advantage that comes
with being from India or China. It's
a horrific oversimplification of the
issue and an insult to the hard work
these individuals put in.
Statistics may.show that Asians
tend to do well academically -
that's true. But race is hardly the
main factor contributing to their
success. Many second-generation1
Asians' parents came from mea-
ger means, working against odds
to get a secondary or professional
education and the necessary paper-
work to immigrate to this country.
Those who made it were already;
the exception, and they continued
to embody a strong work ethic once
they arrived in the United States.+
My dad grew up in a remote vil-
lage in India, living with barely
enough to get by day to day. I'm
sure he never in his wildest dreams;
imagined being able to come to
America. It was his drive and hatd
work that allowed him to come here

and succeed. And coming from that
background, it's natural that he
expects the same from me.
That's the secret to Asians' suc-
cess. They learned early on that no
matter what the challenge, they
needed to give 110 percent of their
effort. And that's the drive and
ambition they impart to their kids.
We make this mistake at both
ends of the academic spectrum -
when dealing with those who are
underrepresented as well as over-
represented. Being black or His-
panic doesn't make you stupid. Yes,
it might make you less likely to be
in a social or economic setting that
allows you to go to and succeed in
college. It might also mean!grow-
ing up in a family environment that
places less emphasis on higher edu-
cation. But race itself doesn't define
ability. There are plenty of white
people and even Asian Americans
who grow up in poor socioeconomic
conditions and end up not going to
college or not excelling academically
- we just rarely hear about them.
Linking
achievement
to race is an
oversimplification.
There's a huge psychological
problem with attributing success,
or lack thereof, to race. For the most
part, race is an aspect of one's iden-
tity that can't be changed. I can't
wake up one day and decide I don't
want to be Indian. But achievement
and success can be changed. They
can be cultivated, no matter what
race someone belongs to. Race is
often seen as an easy way for us to
classify things, but this simplifica-
tion often ignores the underlying
complexities that accompany any
situation or circumstance.

specific IT infrastructures.
"The IT work that stays in the
schools and colleges is' directly
focused on supporting the fac-
ulty and supporting teaching and
learning," Patterson said. "Those
schools and colleges will be run-
ning that special software, but
everyone will be using the shared
infrastructure to drive down
costs."
University Provost Philip Han-
Ion, who helped approve th Next-
Gen program, said in an interview
thathe hopes piecesofthe Univer-
sity's $3 million IT budget will be
used more efficiently as a result of
the program.
He added that even if the new
services cause the department to
be under budget, the department
will not see cuts in the amount of
spending it is allowed.
Instead, money will be
invested in new projects, such as
research computing and learning
technologies, Hanlon said. "The
actual spending will go up, but it
will be less than it would be oth-
erwise." -
Hanlon cited an integrated
server system for the entire cam-
pus as one of the chief ways that
the University intends to reduce
costs in the future. Previously,
units and entities within the Uni-

versity ran their own server sys-
tems, each equipped to meet peak
demand. However, since peak
demand for each system doesn't
come at the same time, Hanlon
said it's more economical to cre-
ate one large server system for all

"We already have a good loan
repayment program, but I would
like us to have a fantastic pro-
gram," West said. "I want stu-
dents to be able to walk in the
front door here and not think, 'ah,
now the rat race begins.' I want
them to think, 'I've made it. I'm
off the treadmill."'
"The market is tight. There's
challenges. I don't want to quote
Coach (Brady) Hoke too much,
but this is Michigan for God's
sake," West said.
Evan Caminker, current dean
of the Law School, will conclude
his 10-year tenure on Aug. 31.
During his deanship, Camink-
er expanded the Law School
through the addition of the South
Hall academic building, Aikens
Commons and the Kirkland &
Ellis Cafe. Renovations are ongo-
ing in the Lawyer's Club and in
Hutchins Hall.
West praised Caminker's lead-
ership in buileting development
during the economic recession.
He added that the connections
Caminker has made with alumni
will be valuable in the future but
graduates have a connection with
the Law School itself, not a par-
ticular dean.
"Mark West will be an out-
standing new dean for the Law
School," Caminker said in a state-
ment. "I'm confident he has the
leadership skills and vision neces-
sary to maintain and enhance the
school's greatness and reputation
in the years ahead."
In an interview Wednes-
day with The Michigan Daily,
Caminker praised West's perfor-
mance as associate dean and said
he would have some familiarity

with the top job once he assumes
it later this year.
"I think that over a number
of generations and a number of
deans, the Law School has built a
special culture," Caminker said.
"It is my fervent hope and expec-
tation that Mark will maintain
it and continue to enhance that
reputation and reality."
Caminker added that he looks
forward to seeing what West can
achieve in adding international
opportunities for law students.
Law School Prof. Ellen Katz,
who chaired the law dean search
committee, said in astatement
West's experience and expertise
made him a good candidate for
the position of dean.
"I am delighted that Mark
West will be the next dean of
the Law School.,He is a first-rate
scholar, widely acclaimed for his
creative, interdisciplinary and
comparative scholarship, and an
accomplished administrator with
energy, enthusiasm and a compre-
hensive and far-reaching vision
for the future of our school," Katz
said.
West's son is a sophomore in
the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance, and his daughter is an LSA
freshman.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said West's salary as
dean will be $425,000 per year.
Caminker's most recent salary
was $470,000.
West will start his post Sept.
1, 2013, pending approval by the
Board of the Regents. Their next
meeting is Feb. 21.

BAND
From Page 1A
my dream to be in the Michigan
Marching Band, and he helped
make that a reality," Salander
said. "I'll never forget how one
day he asked people to switch
from trumpet to horn and when
I volunteered he helped me and
supported me with that. The
very first day he already knew
my name."
Music,Theatre&Dance senior
Eric Szkarlat, who plays the pic-
colo, reflected on the impact of
Boerma's leadership on his past
four seasons with the band.
"All that I can possibly say is,
how lucky Western is to have
him. We were very luckyto have
him, and undoubtedly they'll be

successful," Szkarlat said. "He's
wanted this for a long time, but
basically every music program
he touches turns to gold."
The effects of Boerma's influ-
ence are not only evident in the
words of seasoned veterans, but
also in responses from freshmen
who spent only one season with
him. Many regarded Boerma as
caring, attentive and a motivat-
ing force within the program.
"He was always there to
make sure we were on task, and
I quickly learned a lot," LSA
freshman Sam Wallace said.
Wallace added that even in
one season, he was impacted by
Boerma.
"He was very popular with
everyone within the band, and
people had a lot of respect for
him," Wallace said. "He was

fantastic at arranging 'music,
but, more importantly, had the
power to inspire and motivate
people to push themselves to
always do their best."
Engineering freshman Mon-
ica Walker echoed Wallace's
sentiments, saying that work-
ing under Boerma's leadership
aided in not only her musical
progress, but also in her overall
college experience.
"As a freshman, he really
helped me transition into col-
lege," Walker said. "He came up
to me on the first day and said,
'Hello, Monica. I'm glad you're
here; it's nice to meet you,' and it
was really cool - like he already
knew my name. I'll miss him
terribly, but this is his dream
job and nobody deserves it more
than him."



units and entities.
"It sounds like it's a major
capital expense that you wouldn't
otherwise have, but remember
that all across the University peo-
ple are replacing their servers all
the time," Hanlon said.
He added that the-University
contracted with Accenture, a
large technology consulting firm,
to determine where best to target
cost savings and improve effi-
ciency.
According to both Patterson
and Hanlon, there will also be
staffing changes in the IT depart-
ment to enhance savings and
adjust to new changes.'
"It would be a wonderful thing
if we were able to achieve these
savings and have no firings at all,"
Patterson said.
Hanlon noted that the Uni-
versity will try to achieve staff
reductions through - attrition
rather than layoffs.
Patterson added that there will
be an impact on the workforce
in order to change some jobs to
focus on new technologies.
"We don't want to be running
as much of the commodities," Pat-
terson said. "... We want to invest
more in those technologies that
make Michigan a great univer-
sity so that students and faculties
come here knowing that there is
top-notch technology available for
them."
Previously, the NextGen initia-
tive focused on changing the Uni-
versity's e-mail, which included a
group of 47 different e-mail ser-
vices. For this project, NextGen
collaborated with Google for a
10-year contract that started in
October 201.
According to Patterson,
160,000 accounts now exist under
the University's Google space. Stu-
dents and faculty are able to use
Google products like Calendar,

Hangout and Drive for classes,,
student organizations and other
necessities.
Patterson added Google's
mobile capabilities made it
increasingly attractive for stu-
dents used to checking other ser-
vices and email on-the-go.
However, the transition to
Google-based products has not
been seamless. ITC is working
with Google to improve the acces-
sibility of screen readers - a soft-
ware application that identifies
what is displayed on the screen
- since current versions do not
work well with Google services
right now. Last October, Patterson
addressed leaders of the Central
Student Government and Rack-
ham Student Government, noti-
fying them that Google was not
meeting the University's accessi-
bility standards.
Patterson said Google will be
developing its own screen readers
to solve the problem.
NextGen also coordinated
M+Box - a partnership with
online storage company Box
allows for safe and easy file shar-
ing. Along with the University
of California, Berkeley; Indiana
University; Cornell University;
University Notre Dame; Univer-
sity of Illinois and Carnegie Melon
University, the University started
using Box to allow students and
faculty to share files with each
other while still given protection
by authorizing files.
As the ITC continues to make
more changes, Patterson said ulti-
mately they hope to move to next
generation technologies to accom-
modate student and faculty use of
mobile devices.

relieved to have an explanation
for his decline in health.
"He was happy to have an
answer about falling apart from
the inside out," Carolin said.
After a surgery that drained
the fluids around his tumor,
she said her son returned to his
old self, but with a renowned
zeal to improve the world.
Using funds from the Make-
A-Wish Foundation, he donat-
ed $5,000 toward the United
Nations Foundation, which his
mother said inspired future
donations from other sources.
In August 2009, Carolin
learned that the treatments
were not working and he was
expected to survive only for
two to six months.
Carolin, passed away in
January 2010, but a choice he
made shortly after learning his
illness was terminal has given
hope to other children suffer-
ing from similar conditions:
He was the first pediatric can-
cer patient at the University to
donate his brain for research.
Officials at the University
of Michigan Health System
say his gift has inspired fur-
ther contributions and ongoing
research on pediatric tumors.
AATA

advertisement.
After revising its policy and
revisiting the advertisement
earlier this month, the AATA
upheld its decision not to run
it. Again, noting it ridiculed an
individual or group and was in
violation of their advertising
standards.
"We felt like the ad was
demeaning and offensive of a
certain group and was outside
our standards as the AATA,"
AATA Chairman Charles
Griffith said in an interview.
"We reserve the right to reject
advertisements that are out-
side our standards and stand
by our decision."
Griffith clarified that the
reasons for banning the adver-
tisement are still "valid" with-
in the AATA's new policy and
does not expect the AATA to
change their views on this
matter. He added that a simi-
lar case in the sixth district
court recently ruled in favor of

Hervey-Jumper said brain
donations at UMHS were
extremely rare before Carolin
donated his. Since his dona-
tion, Hervey said about eight
patients, including children
and adults, have donated their
brains to research through a
program inspired by Carolin.
Hervey-Jumper said the
influx of donations has
expanded research opportu-
nities at the University. The
results of research on some of
the brains will be submitted in
the next month, while others
will be published in the coming
several years.
Hervey-Jumper said the
projects are investigating how
tumor cells invade normal
brain tissue and better-target-
ed therapies for glioblastoma.
"It's all about new treat-
ment," Hervey-Jumper said.
"How does it grow? The reason
that a malignant brain tumor is
difficult to treat is that tumor
cells are already invasive andr
you can't just whack an entire
half of a brain. If you can stop
cancer cells from migrating
and growing, you can better
treat those cells and lower the
rate of recurrence."
Garton said whole brain
donations like Carolin's allow
researchers to study cell popu-
lations that have traveled from
a company denying an individ-
ual's advertisement in a similar
conflict.
However, Daniel Korobkin, a
lawyer with the American Civil
Liberties Union - which is rep-
resenting Coleman - said that
the AATA reasoning continues
to deny the advertisement was
deemed unconstitutional by the
court.
Though time has passed in
this process, Korobkin and his
client maintain that the adver-
tisement is still politically rel-
evant.
Korobkin, who spoke on his
client's behalf, said Coleman's
first amendment rights have
been infringed upon.

the tumor.
"Cells that are a long way
away from the center are good
at traveling," Garton said.
"Those are the ones that are
often responsible for recur-
rences. What's different about
a glial cell that's travelled away
from the tumor mass? If you
can answer that question that
offers a whole new avenue of
treatment."
Prof. Karin Muraszko, chair
of the Department of Neurosur-
gery at the University, wrote in
an e-mail interview that many
patients decided to give their
brains once they learned of the
need for donations.
"The brain donation pro-
gram came about through the
generosity of our patients,"
Muraszko wrote. "As more
of patients asked about the
research we were doing and
the challenges we faced, more
patients and their families
began to offer to donate."
Muraszko praised Carolin's
selflessness in the months
before his death and his con-
sideration of other patients.
"His legacy lives on not
only in his tumor specimen
and brain donation," Murasz-
ko wrote, "but in providing
us with an example of cour-
age, caring and out-of-the-box
thinking."
Korobkin said if the court
orders the AATA to permit the
advertisement, he anticipates
cooperation, though there is
the possibility of appeal. He
also added that the decision
to change their policy skirts
"the real issue," which is the
infringement of Coleman's
constitutional right to free
speech.
"There hasn't been a final
resolution," Korobkin said.
"We got them to change their
policy, so that was certainly
a victory for the first amend-
ment, but now we need a reme-
dy, which we obviously believe
is running the ad."

Israeli law looks to make
ultra-thin models obsolete

On Monday, Palestinian students study Hebrew at the Islamic University in Gaza City. Gaza's Islamic University, a
stronghold of the ruling Hamas militant group, has started its first Hebrew-language class.

Stelman is 1.7 meters tall

"I never weigh myself. I don't
care. I don't even have a scale,"
she said. "Weight is just a num-
ber. As long as I feel good and
healthy - that's all that matters."
One of the main supporters of
the new legislation is Adi Barkan,
one of Israel's top model agents.
In 30 years of work, he says he
has seen young women become
skinnier and sicker while strug-
gling to fit the shrinking mold
of what the industry considers
attractive.
He said Europe's fashion has
started shifting back. "They
understand that something has
to change," said Barkan, noting
the rampant use of Photoshop,
the popular picture editing com-
puter program, to make models
look even skinnier.
The Israeli law requires that
any advertisement published for
the Israeli market must clearly
disclose whether the models'
appearance was altered by digi-
tal manipulation.

Goal is for students
in Gaza Strip to
learn language
of Israel
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)
- Hamas' flagship university in
Gaza has a new diploma on offer
- Hebrew, the official language
of its arch-foe Israel.
Gaza's Hamas rulers say they
want to produce qualified teach-
ers as the government gradually
introduces Hebrew studies in its
high schools. The aim is simple:
It wants Palestinians in Gaza to
learn their enemy's language.
"As Jews are occupying our
lands, we have to understand
their language," said Educa-
tion Ministry official Somayia
Nakhala.
There are 19 students
enrolled in the first one-year
Hebrew diploma course offered
at the Islamic University in Gaza
City, a stronghold of Hamas, the
Islamic militant group that has
ruled Gaza since 2007. Hamas
does not recognize Israel, is
officially pledged to its destruc-
tion and has killed hundreds
of Israelis in suicide bomb-

ings, rocket strikes and other
attacks.
Officials hope graduates
will become Hebrew teach-
ers. Hamas has already begun
offering Hebrew studies as an
elective to ninth graders in 16
schools, and plans to expand
the program to dozens of other
schools in the coming months.
Israel occupied Gaza for 38
years after capturing it, along
with the West Bank and east
Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mid-
east war. Since withdrawing
its settlers and troops from
Gaza in 2005, Israel has fought
two wars against Hamas and
restricts access to the territory
by air, land and sea.
The coastal strip still relies
on Israeli-run crossings for
most consumer goods, and
Gaza patients must receive spe-
cial permits to reach medical
care in Israel or the West Bank.
Students need to "under-
stand what's going on, like
wars, medical treatment in
Israel, in the West Bank,"
said the Education Ministry's
Nakhala.
There is no shortage of
Hebrew speakers in Gaza, at
least among older residents.
For years, Gaza Palestinians

entered Israel to work in res-
taurants, construction and
other menial jobs. Thousands
of others learned the language
while held in Israeli prisons.
In quieter times, many Israelis
would come to Gaza to fix their
cars, bargain hunt or eat at local
restaurants.
But after the outbreak of the
first Palestinian uprising in
the late 1980s, Israelis stopped
coming. After a second uprising
erupted in 2000, Israel sharply
restricted the entry of Gazans.
Since Israel's pullout and the
subsequent Hamas takeover,
direct contact between the
sides is virtually nonexistent.
This tortured relationship
with Israel was on display dur-
ing Hebrew class this week at
the Islamic University.
Two women, their faces
veiled in line with conserva-
tive Muslim beliefs, practiced
Hebrew in a doctor-patient dia-
logue. When the conversation
turned to the chilly weather,
another student described
being cold while held in an
Israeli prison because he wasn't
given a blanket.
"Saval maspik," he said in
broken Hebrew. "Suffered
enough."

said Chicago police detectives
questioned her in November for
more than four hours at a police
station and executed a search
warrant on the two-story home
where she lived with Khan.
9 *Pa e Attorney Steven Kozicki said
Ansari maintains she had noth-
ing to do with the death of her
9 i46-year-old husband and he has
no indication that investigators
might be looking at her as a poten-
tial suspect.

"In any case where a husband
dies in that manner, sure they're
going to talk to the spouse," he
said. "That's what they've done....
I believe that she had nothing to
do with his death. She vehement-
ly says that she had nothing to do
with his death."
The fact that Khan died with-
out a will opened the door to
the legal tussle over his estate,
which his wife says amounts to
more than $1.2 million, including
the prize money, his share of the
dry-cleaning businesses and real
estate, as well as several vehicles
and a bank account.
Under Illinois law, Khan's
estate would be split between his
wife and 17-year-old daughter
from a previous marriage.
Howe'ver, Khan's brother
Imtiaz and sister Meraj -Khan *
expressed concern in court filings
that Khan's daughter might not
get her fair share. The siblings,
who live in the Chicago area, are
not staking a claim to any of the
money for themselves. They ini-
tially won an order from a pro-
bate judge in September to freeze
the lottery check, asserting his
widow tried to cash it.
Meraj Khan is also seeking to
become the legal guardian of the
teen, who lives with Ansari.
Ultimately, the probate
judge granted Ansari's compet-
ing request to administer the
estate but has yet to decide how
to divide the assets, including
the lottery payout. The assets
remain held up by the court
proceedings, and Ansari denies
removing any of the assets.
Ansari's probate attorney
could not be reached for com-
ment, and the lawyer represent-
ing Khan's siblings declined to
discuss the case. Imtiaz Khan
also did not return a phone mes-
sage.
The next status hearing is
scheduled for Jan.24.

British man sentenced for
attempted missile sale

Businessman tried
to sell U.S. weapon
parts to Iran
EL PASO, Texas (AP) - A
federal judge sentenced a Brit-
ish businessman to nearly three
years in prison Wednesday for
trying to buy surface-to-air
missile parts from undercover
U.S. agents to resell to Iran.
Christopher Tappin, 66,
pleaded guilty in November to
aiding and abetting to export
defense materials in a deal
that opened the door for him
to serve part of his sentence
in Britain near his ailing wife.
U.S. District Judge David Brio-
nes in El Paso said Wednesday
that he would recommend that
the U.S. Department of Justice
approve any request by Tappin
to be transferred to the United
Kingdom.
Tappin read a brief statement
during the sentencing hearing
in which he apologized for the
crime.
"I regret my actions and the
impact they had on my family,"
he said. "I am looking forward
to putting this incident behind
me and returning to my previ-
ous unblemished life and my
wife."
As part of the plea deal, pros-

ecutors agreed not to oppose
any request by Tappin to serve
part of his 33-month sentence
in Britain. Along with approval
from the Department of Jus-
tice, Tappin also needs approval
from the British government to
serve time in one of its prisons.
In 2006, Tappin associ-
ate Robert Gibson contacted a
company set up by undercover
U.S. agents to buy batteries for
surface-to-air missiles. U.S.
authorities alleged Tappin pro-
vided undercover agents with
false documents to deceive
authorities and circumvent the
requirement for the batteries to
be licensed by the U.S. govern-
ment before being exported.
"We hope this sends a mes-
sage to people that are selling
defense materials that we moni-
tor sales and shipments, and
that we are watching," federal
prosecutor Greg McDonald said
Wednesday.
The judge dismissed charges
of conspiracy to illegally export
defense articles and conspira-
cy to conduct illegal financial
transactions. Tappin must also
pay an $11,357 fine, the amount
he would have profited from the
sale.
Tappin must report to prison
by March 8. His lawyers asked
that he be allowed to report to a
Pennsylvania prison, something

the judge said he did not oppose.
Tappin will likely spend six to
nine months in the United States
before being sent back to Britain,.
Tappin's attorney, Dan Cogdell,
said. There, he will serve no
more than half of the remaining
sentence, Cogdell said.
"I look forward to returning
home to be near my friends and
family, and especially my sick
wife," Tappin said afterward.
Tappin fought extradition
to the' United States for two
years until being denied a peti-
tion to take the case to Britain's
Supreme Court. His extradition
touched a nerve in Britain among
those who believe extradition
arrangements with the United
States are unfairly weighted
against British citizens.
After he was brought to Texas
in February, Tappin was held at
the Otero County Jail for about
two months, where he initially
was put in solitary confinement
at his request. Tappin was later
released on bond in April and
has since lived near his lawyer's
house in a gated community in
Houston.
Gibson, another British
national, pleaded guilty in April
2007 and was sentenced to 24
months in prison. An Oregon
man, Robert Caldwell, was found
guilty in July of that year and
received a 30-month sentence.

ROSS D. FRANtLIN/AP
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio speaks with the media talking about the Sheriff's new program providing security
around schools in his jurisdiction, at Anthem Elementary School.
rme olunteers to atrol
59 schools in Arizona

As many as 500
Volunteers to guard
areas near schools
PHOENIX (AP) - The sher-
iff for metropolitan Phoenix has
launched a plan to have as many
as 500 armed volunteers patrol
areas just outside schools in an
effort to guard against shootings
like month's attack at a Connecti-
cut elementary school that left 26
people'dead.
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe
Arpaio's office said Wednesday
that the patrols were launched
earlier this week at 59 schools in
unincorporated areas and com-
munities that pay his agency for
police services.
Arpaio hopes to have as many
as 400 posse volunteers and
another 100 volunteers known as
reserve deputies take part in the
patrols.
The plan from the sheriff
known for immigration enforce-
ment and housing jail inmates in
canvas tents has led some long-
time critics to say Arpaio's latest
effort is meant to grab headlines
and won't be sustained over the
long term.
"Why would people complain
about my posse being in front
of schools to act as prevention?"
Arpaio asked, noting that he
wants the patrols to last through-
out the remainder of the school
year.
The sheriff said school shoot-
ings in Connecticut and else-
where and last month's arrest of
an Arizona student accused of
planning an attack at her high
school led to his decision to
launch the patrols.
The volunteers, dressed in
uniforms and driving patrol
vehicles, won't go onto school

grounds unless they spot danger
and won't sit in stationary spots.
Instead, they'll patrol several
schools as part of their driving
routes.
Andrew Sanchez, a town
council member in Guadalupe,
said he doesn't want the sheriff's
posse members patrolling outside
schools in his town. The commu-
nity of about 6,000 spends $1.2
million a year to have Arpaio's
office provide police protection.
"We are paying him to have
certified deputies here, not to
bring a circus and not to use our
town as a political platform,"
Sanchez said.
He predicted the volunteer
patrols would disappear once
media attention had faded.
Distrust of Arpaio in Guada-
lupe runs deep after the sheriff's
deputies poured into the town
during one of his first trademark
immigration sweeps in April
2008.
During the crackdowns, depu-
ties surge into an area of a city
- in some cases, heavily Latino
areas - to seek out traffic viola-
tors and arrest other offenders
over several days.
Arpaio announced his plans
Wednesday on the grounds of
an elementary school, saying he
wants the patrols publicized.
"I want everyone to know
aboutit for the deterrence effect,"
he said.
The announcement came on
the same day that the tbp Demo-
crat in the Arizona House put
forth a proposal to triple funding
for school resource officers, add
money for mental health treat-
ment and require background
checksonallbuyers atgunshows.
Arpaio said no taxpayer money
would be spent on the patrols and
volunteers will be supervised by
radio or phone by deputies.
Joselyn Wells, the mother

of three children at a school in
suburban Anthem, where Arpa-
io's posse members have begun
patrolling, said she was excited to
hear about the initiative.
"A lot of people sit around
and watch these things happen,
watch key signs and no one wants
to do anything about it," she said.
"Nobody wants conflict, nobody
wants to be out in the limelight.
And he doesn't care. He wants to
do the right thing."
Arpaio has relied heavily on
his posse, which consist of about
3,000 unpaid civilians, including
action-film star Steven Seagal.
They assist deputies in duties
such as providing free police pro-
tection at malls during the holi-
days, directing traffic at wreck
scenes and transporting to jail
the people who are arrested in
immigration patrols. One group
of posse members conducted an
examination into the authentic-
ity of President Barack Obama's
birth certificate.
Members wear uniforms and
can get authorized to carry a
gun after fraining, though only
400 can actually carry guns.
They can make arrests only at
the direction of a deputy sheriff.
Posse operations generally don't
receive taxpayer money -and
instead are funded through con-
tributions and dues paidby posse
members.
The reserve deputies who will
join posse members in the school
patrols have all the training and
powers of a regular law enforce-
ment officer but aren't paid for
their police work.
Monica Allread, spokeswom-
an for the Tempe Elementary
School District, which includes
an elementary school in Guada-
lupe, shied away from comment-
ing on Arpaio's new plan. But she
said the district aims to improve
safety at its schools.

Egyptian party elects leader
after months of infighting'

Salafi Al-Nour
party sets sights on
winning seats in
parliament
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's larg-
est ultraconservative Islamist
party, which has emerged as
a potent political force in the
country, elected a new leader
Wednesday after the previous
head broke away to form his
own political group following
months of infighting.
Younis Makhyoun, a 58-year-
old cleric and trained dentist,
was selected in a consensus
vote to lead the Salafi Al-Nour
party, one of several religion-
based parties to take root after
the 201 Egyptian uprising. His
election marks the consolida-
tion of power within the party
of the religious clerics who co-
founded Al-Nour and success-
fully faced down a challenge to
separate the group's political
and religious leadership.
The infighting could cost the
Salafis in upcoming parliamen-
tary elections as they compete

with fellow Islamists for seats
in the legislature and try to
shape Egypt's future in a politi-
cal struggle with secular-mind-
ed political groups.
Egyptian President Moham-
med Morsi is expected to set
a date soon for the elections.
His spokesman, Yasser Ali,
told reporters Wednesday that
preparations for the vote would
begin Feb. 25.
In taking the reins of the
party, Makhyoun immediately
turned his sights Wednesday to
the elections. He described the
next parliament as "the most
dangerous and the most impor-
tant" in Egypt's history because
its mission will be "to purify
all laws from whatever violates
Shariah," or Islamic law.
Makhyoun was a member of
the Islamist-dominated con-
stituent assembly that wrote
Egypt's new constitution. The
document deeply polarized
Egyptians and sparked deadly
street protests, but passed by a
64 percent "yes" vote in a ref-
erendum in which around 33
percent of voters participated.
Islamists perceive the consti-
tution as the first step toward

redefining Egypt's identity to
conform to Islamic law..
"We want to liberate Egypt
from slavery and submission,"
Makhyoun said Wednesday,
while also trying to assuage
fears of women and Christians
by saying Shariah would "liber-
ate even Western women from
the West's moral decay."
Al-Nour was founded by a
group of influential hardline
Salafi clerics shortly after the
2011 Egyptian uprising that
toppled longtime strongman
Hosni Mubarak. Their single-
minded dedication to apply-
ing Islamic law sets them
apart from Egypt's strongest
Islamist force, the Muslim
Brotherhood, which shares
many of the Salafi fundamen-
talist beliefs but also has a his-
tory of political pragmatism to
achieve its ends.
Salafis follow the Wahhabi
school of thought, which pre-
dominates in SaudiArabia. They
promote a strict interpretation
of Islamic law which mandates
segregation of the sexes, bans
banks from charging interest
and punishes theft by cutting
off thieves' hands.


Pakistani NATO suppliers on
strike in light of poor conditions

Troops in
Afghanistan now
use longer, more
expensive route
PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP)
- Truckers who carry supplies
to NATO troops in Afghanistan
have gone on strike in northwest
Pakistan to protest lower pay,
inadequate security and cor-
rupt officials who demand bribes
from the truckers, officials said
Wednesday.
The supply route is an impor-
tant lifeline for international
forces in landlocked Afghanistan.
The coalition ships a significant
portion of its nonlethal supplies
through Pakistan into south-
ern Afghanistan. The other land
route into Afghanistan through
Central Asia and Russia is longer
and more expensive.
The strike began in response
to the government's decision to
require truckers to go through
authorized companies to carry
NATO supplies instead of making

individual deals with the govern-
ment-run National Logistics Cell,
said Jehanzeb Khan, head of a
transport workers union in north-
west Pakistan. The companies pay
the truckers less, said Khan.
He also claimed the govern-
ment was not providing adequate
protection to the drivers from
Taliban attacks, and each truck
had to pay corrupt security offi-
cials about $165 in bribes to pass
through the Khyber tribal area
on the way to the border.
Khan said truckers in north-
west Pakistan stopped carrying
NATO supplies Wednesday, and
he was reaching out to others
throughout the country to get
them to join the strike.
Haneef Khan Marwat, head of
a transportation company in the
southern city of Karachi, said
some truckers began their strike
as early as Jan. 4 and thousands
of vehicles are involved. He said
the strike would continue until
the government reversed its new
policy.
No trucks carrying NATO
supplies crossed the northwest
Torkham border on Wednesday,

said local political official Tahir
Khan.
Torkham is one of two cross-
ings used to ship NATO supplies
to Afghanistan.
Goods continued to move
through the other crossing, Cha-
man, in southwest Pakistan,
said clearing agent Mohammed
Asghar.
Pakistan closed its Afghan
border to NATO supplies for
seven months in response to
U.S. airstrikes that accidentally
killed 24 Pakistani soldiers in
November 2011. Pakistan finally
reopened the route after the U.S.
apologized for the deaths.
Also Wednesday, police said
they arrested five Pakistani
Taliban militants involved in the
killing of two female polio work-
ers in the southern city of Kara-
chi in December. Senior police
official Ghulam Shabbir Shaikh
told reporters that the five mili-
tants are from the northwest
Swat Valley and confessed to
their participation in the killings,
saying they believed the polio
vaccine was meant to make Mus-
lim children sterile.

Michigan dodges upset
to remain undefeated

Redshirt junior left tackle Taylor Lewan announced Wednesday that he will not enter the 2013 NFL Draft.
Lewan to re,..turn

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
At some point ina long phone
conversation with Jake Long, the
former Michigan offensive line-
man and No. 1 overall pick in the
NFL draft, Michigan tackle Tay-
lor Lewan just wanted an answer.
Stay or go?
Long told Lewan he couldn't
make that decision for him. And so
Lewan leaned on the past. What
did you do, Lewan asked. Long
had stayed, and over the course of
30 to 45 minuteshe told Lewan all
the reasons why.
And so after weeks of perceived
hints, Lewan declared Wednesday
in assurprising announcement that
he will stay at Michigan for his
fifth-year senior season, forgoing a
shot at the 2013 NFL Draft. Heed-
ing the custom set by linemen like
Long, and even the mantra of late
Michigan coach Bo Schembechler,
Lewan chose Michigan tradition
over NFL riches.
"Offensive lineman here, they
stay," said Michigan coach Brady
Hoke at a press conference. "And
there's been a tradition of that."
He cotinued, referencing Long
and former linemen Jon Jansen
and Chris Hutchinson. "Jake and
Jansen, and you could go back
through it. Hutch and all those
guys.
ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr. had
* listed Lewan as the No. 15 player
overall on his most recent Big
Board Wednesday. Lewan was
" considered by most to be the sec-
ond-best offensive tackle on the
board, behind Texas A&M tackle
" Luke Joeckel.
ScoutsInc.ranked Lewan No.13
on in its top-32 players in the 2013

as a high first-round pick. Were he

After the Michigan hockey
team's 5-1 loss Tuesday to Bowl-
ing Green, Michigan coach Red
e Wrenson was asked about his
team's defensive struggles. Like
he has all season, he mentioned
poor defensive-zone coverage.
Defensive-zone miscues have
been an alarming trend for the
Wolverines and have led to many
easy goals in front of the net for
opponents. This came as a sur-
prise to those who pegged Michi-
gan as having one of the best
defensive units in the country
before the season began.
The unit was expected tobe led
by junior defenseman Jon Mer-
rill - a 2010 second-round draft
pick of the New Jersey Devils
and a preseason all-CCHA selec-
tion. But when Merrill suffered a
cracked vertebrae on Oct. 9, the
defense took a turn for the worse.
This season, the Wolver-
ines have struggled mightily to
keep the puck out of their own
net - their average of 3.40 goals
allowed per game is currently last

in the conference. The absence of
Merrill didn't help, but there are
bigger issues than one missing
player. Whether it is the defense-
men or the forwards, the defen-
sive effort hasn't been what it
needs to be for Michigan.

year's 13th pick, Notre Dame wide
receiver Michael Floyd.
Floyd signed with the Ari-
zona Cardinals for just less than
$10 million guaranteed over four
years, with a team option for a
fifth year. Players selected in the
top 10 last year earned four year
deals worth an average just less
than $16.5 million (two players,
selected Nos. 4 and 5Soverall, did
not report their contracts).
Lewan said he plans to take out
an insurance policy, which could
mitigate the financial sting if he
suffers an injury before the 2014
NFL Draft. He has not yet signed
the paperwork, and even an insur-
ance policy would not offset any
financial losses he might incur if
his draft stock were to plummet.
Still, Lewan said, "it really was
a no brainer at the end."
Lewan's decision came after
a phone call to the Long and an
eye toward the future. He has
started in 28 consecutive games
at left tackle for the Wolverines,
and his departure would have fur-
ther decimated an already under-
achieving offensive line.
With Lewan back, Michigan
will return both starting tackles
- right tackle Michael Schofield
will be a fifth-year senior for 2013
season - but the Wolverines will
graduate the entire interior of the
line as well as their top blocking
tight end, Mike Kwiatkowski.
Michigan will likely field a
young line on the inside. Though
much can change, 2013 redshirt
freshman Kyle Kalis is thebestbet
to start at guard, and the center
position should be redshirt sopho-
more Jack Miller's to lose.
"Kyle Kalis and (freshmen line-
men) Ben Braden and Erik Mag-
nusen, I want to be a part of their
lives for one more year and help
them to develop into something
where they can possibly be in my
position in a couple years," Lewan

said.
The other guard 'position is
more open, with redshirt fresh-
man Blake Bars and redshirt
sophomore Chris Bryant as likely
options. Redshirt junior guard
Joey Burzynski is the only upper-
classman with a strongshot to win
the job, and he is the only option
who has seen game action - he
played in seven games as a backup
in 2012 and appeared in four more
in 2011.
Lewan's return means added
continuity, and it is a blessing for
quarterback Devin Gardner, who
will rely on Lewan to protect his
blind side. Throughout the pro-
cess, though, Lewan kept his
teammates in the dark. He waited
until just 20 minutes before his
announcement, at ateam meeting,
to break the news.
The room erupted in cheers.
Still, when asked if he was sur-
prised by Lewan's decision, Hoke
responded with a simple "no."
To that, Lewan turned toward
his father, who attended the press
conference, and whispered, "Oh
my god, he's lying," with a laugh.
Most in Ann Arbor expected
Lewan to declare for the draft.
"I think my Dad predicted me
to leave too," Lewan said.
At first, Lewan consulted
with others and just wanted
an answer. It is a big decision,
he explained, for a 21-year old.
Ultimately, he decided that the
chance for one more year at
Michigan, one more shot at a Big
Ten Championship, was worth it.
"If you play at the University
of Michigan, whether it's basket-
ball, hockey, football, there's a
tradition here and there's some-
thing that you want to be a part
of," Lewan said. "And if I do what
I need to do, I'll be able to play
in the NFL for however long, but
you only get one more year of
college."

The third possession of the
second half defined those final 20
minutes for the No. 2 Michigan
men's basketball team in its 62-47

whole was not up to par.
Injuries have been 'a constant
thorn in the sidefor the defense
this season. Just when the unit
appeared to be coming together
and fully healthy, sophomore
Brennan Serville and junior Mac
Bennett were injured during
Tuesday's game. Berenson said
that Serville is day-to-day and
Bennett is out for at least a "cou-
ple of weeks." Along with those
two players,junior Kevin Clare -
still on the injury list - will also
not play this weekend.
"We were excited to get Jonny
Merrill back and then Mac Ben-
nett goes down," Berenson said.
"Mac's been arguably in our top
pair all season."
With the depleted defensive
corps, Berenson will use senior
forward Jeff Rohrkemper as a
defenseman this weekend against
Alaska. Rohrkemper, who saw
time at the position against
Northern Michigan earlier in the
season, does not have much expe-
rience at the position.
"I think when (Rohrkemper)
realizes how bad this team needs
him, and how bad we need to play
better defense, hopefully he'll be

fine," Berenson said. "He's got
good defensive instincts. He's a
team player and he's a senior."
Berenson also noted the play of
the forwards on the defensive end
- and the correlation between
their ability to control the puck
and maintain possession - and
the defensive flow. Against Bowl-
ing Green, the puck was constant-
ly deep in the Wolverines' zone,
and the offense failed to get any
momentum going.
The miscues, which resulted in
at least two easy Bowling Green
goals on Tuesday, have stemmed
from a combination of miscom-
munication and lack of aware-
ness. With a depleted defensive
corps, it will be even more impor-
tant for the defensemen to com-
municate and understand exactly
what their role is. Berenson said
that he has been looking at the
forwards' play on defense just as
much as their offensive produc-
tion.
"We've got to be a lot more
defensively aware," he said.
"When you look at the score sheet
andyou see someone who's minus
four, he's not had a good game.
Luke Moffatt scored his first goal
of the year, but he may have taken
himself out of the lineup just the
way he played defensively. You
got to play hard in the defensive
zone. None of us are good enough
to outscore our mistakes."

4. Grimes
Visions

Beach House is no stranger to
success. The Baltimore duo got
its first taste of indie fame after
releasing Teen Dream in 2010,
a sweet and hazy collection of
songs that gently lulled its lis-
teners and drew in a fan base.
Now, two years later, Bloom is
just as sweet - it's a soft, potent
cultivation of everything Beach
House for which it has already
been known.
Like former hits "Norway"
and "Take Care," tracks like
"Myth" and "Lazuli" are just as

quietly powerful, deeply per-
sonal and haunting: Victoria
Legrand's rich, smokyvocals rise
and fall over hazy guitar chords
and keyboard keys, creating a
tender, dreamlike world of oohs,
ahhs and instrumentals.
The album is darker and more
refined than anything the band
has created in the past - it isn't
a reproduction of classic Beach
House sounds and vibes, but liv-
ing proof that the duo itself has
bloomed.
-CHLOE STACHOWIAK

It's tempting to call Visions
"pop" - the album, the fourth
release from electro-artist
Grimes, packs enough sugary
falsetto vocals and dance beats
to fuel a Forever 21 playlist for
days. But stamping this kind of
label on the album would just
be too simple: Visions is a beau-
tifully complicated creature
that thrives on intricacy and
confusion, constantly twisting
and convoluting what seems
like straight-forward sounds
into something more obscure.

Quiet melodies are mashed
with other melodies, and beats
are layered on top of other
beats. Vocals are looped, lay-
ered and manipulated further,
appearing both bold and trans-
lucent in any given moment.
The end result is more fasci-
nating and murky than main-
stream dance or electronic pop
- Visions is a fleeting ghost
that fades and flitters away
before anyone can fully latch
onto it.

5. the xx
Coexist

"Space can actually be a band's
most valuable instrument" is
essentially the overarching theme
of the xx's second album, Coexist.
Furthering its minimalist pursuit
of "Basic Space," this London trio
crafted abeautifulandsubtlecollec-
tion ofsongs in 2012 that might have
beentooslighttocatchtheearsofan
in-your-face, dubstep generation.
Though these songs unde-
niably progress at a deliberate
pace, Coexist's most breathtaking
moments are a result of the band's

increasingly pause-laden style.
The four-second gap in sound
that occurs before the crescendo
of guitar, drums and vocals at
the halfway point of "Missing,"
for example, feels like the heart-
dropping sensation of a free-fall-
ing thrill ride.
While it lacks the pop sensi-
bility of the group's 2009 debut,
Coexist is a heartbreaking and
powerful sophomore effort that
deserves repeated listening.
-JOHN LYNCH

Don't listen to Frank Ocean's
grandiose epic "Pyramids"
unless you're prepared to eat,
breathe and sleep it for months.
This patchwork quilt of influ-
ences lasts for 10 brilliant min-
utes, but contains an entire
album's worth of creativity.
Frank Ocean was bound to hit
that No. 1 spot. His effortless
cool made him Odd Future's
sole mom-approved member,
and the Jay-Z co-sign didn't
hurt. But when "Pyramids"
came out, the world finally
found Frank.
His dynamism is evident in

every second of "Pyramids."
Combining R&B and dance
music in a tale of two Cleopatras,
Ocean croons about unrequited
love, betrayal and prostitution.
The deliberate combination of
warped electro-beats and John
Mayer guitar will please patient
listeners and throw them down
the very rabbit holes where the
two queens reside.
"Pyramids" is a once-in-a-
career triumph for most artists,
but here's hoping that Frank
Ocean has a lifetime of classics
ahead of him..
-ANDREWECKHOUS

"Swimming Pools" begins like
anyother pop-rap hit. As looming
synths build upon a steadily clap-
ping snare, a reverberating voice
beckons its audience to "pour up"
and "drank." What distances the
track from any other "party" rap
hit, however, is the evolution the
song takes as it builds upon the
dark synths of its beginning.
On the surface, the song is pure
fun - it rides like a Drake track
and encourages binge drinking -
but as it lyrically morphs, a deeper
thematic presence settles in. Ken-
drick goes from the scenes of a
party to memories of his alcoholic

grandfather, from shot-taking to
sorrow-drowning, from diving
in swimming pools of liquor to
concerns of the poison he's con-
suming.
If it's even possible, Kendrick
crafts a perennial party playlist
song with deep conscience, one that
forces its possibly intoxicated lis-
teners to think about the decisions
they make and even their lives as a
whole. It seems that only Kendrick
could beckon such a response, and
he does so with great success -
turn on any pop station and you'll
probably hear itsometime soon.

Best TV Shows of 2012

2. "Game of Thrones"

3. "Parks and Recreation"

It's not always obvious what a show will do
after taking as big a risk as "Game of Thrones"
did in its season one finale. It's now safe to say
that the HBO fantasy-drama has successfully
maintained a high level of excitement and sus-
pense after killing off the one hope that Westeros
had.
Season two continued the battle of the Seven
Kingdoms, introducing new players Theon Grey-
joy and Stannis Baratheon to fight for control
against fan favorites like Robb Stark and Daener-

ys Targaryen. In addition to the new faces, depth
was added to existing characters Arya Stark and
Tyrion Lannister - both impossibly more badass
than before.
Though the landscape seems sprawling, "Game
of Thrones" kept us afloat among the details with
vivid storytelling and visuals.
And though it seemed impossible, season two
has made us all hate Joffrey Baratheon more than
ever before.
-RADHIKA MENON

It's the little things that make NBC's "Parks and
Recreation" quietly superb: Jean Ralphio, Bert
Macklin's (FBI) guest appearances, Ron's Tammy
terror.
It certainly takes a tremendous amount of skill,
dedication and heart for a series to so fully shake
off humble beginnings and create one of the most
expertly defined, lovable ensemble caststo grace our
TV sets in years.
And the ensemble is what "Parks" is all about.
Where would Ron be without Leslie's birthday scav-

enger hunts and not-so-subtle matchmaking? Poor
Tom would still be mourning Entertainment 720
without Ben's restrained guidance, Andy and April
would be lost (literally, in Andy's case) without each
other and Garry wouldn't be Jerry without his exas-
perating co-workers.
Seamlessly blending new characters, challenges
and campaigns, "Parks" is more than a sitcom. It's a
love letter to the idea that people can make a differ-
ence. And also, bacon.
-KELLYETZ

BBC

HBO

4. "Sherlock"

5. "Girls"

The BBC's edgy series, "Sherlock," crafts a deftly
clever name for itself amid endless Holmes re-imag-
inations by thrusting the famed detective into con-
temporary London while still faithfully assimilating
Conan Doyle's original vision.
Marvelously witty, the series plays on classic
Holmes - with mysteries such as "A Scandal in Bel-
gravia," featuring the infamous Irene Adler, now a
dominatrix - without losing any modernity in the
process. The writing is unflinchingly smart, one could
expect nothing less from "Doctor Who" veterans Ste-
ven Moffat and Mark Gatiss.

But the invigorating mystery series reaches new
heights because of its superb cast and buckets of
chemistry. Benedict Cumberbatch spins Sherlock as
dismissively superior in both intellect and charisma.
Martin Freeman's Watson is a flawlessly on-point
blend of cynicism. affection and protectiveness. Add
Andrew Scott's blissfully demented Moriarty and the
series practically drips talent.
The insanely addictive background score and skill-
fully crafted twists and turns make "Sherlock" the
Holmes for a new millennium.
-KELLYETZ

It'sbeen hailed as intuitive and honest; it'sbeen
criticized as "too young-and-female-centric." It's
been loved and hated, but HBO's "Girls," starring
writer and creator Lena Dunham, was one of the
most groundbreaking shows of 2012. The show
follows a group of twenty-somethings navigating
the awkwardness of post-grad life with the for-
mula of "Sex and the City" and the unapologetic
persona of Generation Y.
The show doesn'tshy away from HBO's now-
renowned sexual explicitness and painfully

uncomfortable social situations. Dunham's char-
acters portray a new wave of youth; a generation
prepared to struggle for identity after gradua-
tion, knowing that the prolonged journey will
teach us more about ourselves.
The show doesn't spe'ak for everyone, but it
certainly speaks to everyone. As Dunham spells
out, she isn't trying tobe the voice of our genera-
tion; she is simply the "voice of a generation."
Whatever the story, her voice is worth a listen.

3,11, "Argo ty

Few movies were anticipated in 2012 the way
"Dijango Unchained" was. Thankfully, even fewer
movies were able to deliver on the hype the way
"Django" did. Quentin Tarantino is at his best,
as the film features violence galore coupled with
sharp, intelligent dialogue. The story's compelling,
the shots are beautiful, the characters are engaging
and the soundtrack fits the film perfectly, even if it
is a little unorthodox (c'mon, the guy put Rick Ross
in a western - RICK ROSS!).

As promised, the all-star. cast of Jamie Foxx,
Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio is phe-
nomenal. Foxx is transformed into one of the all-
time greatest cinematic badasses by the end of the
film. Waltz is as impressive as he was in "Inglou-
rious Basterds," and DiCaprio is able to step out
of his normal role and steal most of his scenes as
antagonist Calvin Candie. Simply put, this was a
great movie.
-CONRAD FOREMAN

"Argo" is a rollercoaster ride that you don't
want to end. Even though it's a biopic and the
"What happens?" is no mystery, the captivating
question in this film is: "How the hell did they pull
that off?" Ben Affleck knocks it out of the park as
he directs and stars in this true story about CIA
agent Tony Mendez, who concocts a fake movie
project called "Argo," to seek permission for a
"location scout" in Iran, so he can smuggle U.S.
embassy officials to safety.

John Goodman and Alan Arkin are hilarious as
a Hollywood make-up artist and a producer past
his prime who help Tony promote, advertise and
market this faux film.
I laughed, I cried, I gripped my chair and I thor-
oughly enjoyed the dialogue; out of it came one of
the most memorable phrases of the year. What is
it, you may ask? Go see "Argo" and you'll know.
when you hear it.
-CARLY KEYES

4. "Cabin in the Woods"

5. "Skyfall"

"Cabin in the Woods"is probably the boldest movie
to have graced the big screen in a really long time. It
should be revered, acknowledged and seen. Why?
Because"Cabin"bringsbacksome much-neededrele-
vance to the genre ofhorror by mocking every stereo-
typical plotline that's rendered it trite and irrelevant.
A group of friends embark on a holiday to a pre-
dictably creepy, secluded cabin in the woods. While
everything about this film, includingits name and ini-

tial plotline, seems to be an echo of a million movies
past, things quickly take a turn for the unusual. The
climax is a slap in the face for anyone who thinksthey
know horror. The actors, led by Chris Hemsworth,
are OK but inferior to the script itself. Joss Whedon
and Drew Goddard's brilliant brainchild is undoubt-
edly a cult classic that has enough blind spots to thrill
even the most seasoned film buffs.
-ADITI MISHRA

It'd be simple to say "Skyfall" has great perfor-
mances, a great script and great set pieces, but this
James Bond ripples with urgency.
Daniel Craig instills gaping soul into his char-
acter. Javier Bardem at once intrigues you, makes
you squirm and pity him. The gun fights are bold
and loud. Resurrection is its hobby, and it makes a
damn good case for our favorite superspy's trium-
phant return.

But where "Skyfall" plants thrills, laughs and
C4 explosives, it also fills with shadows. It's about
unseen enemies moving in the dark, the deep
places in which we hide, the secrets of the past.
It necessitates those hard-nosed heroes we holdI
more dearly than we realize because in the times
we live, fictional and real, we're aware of just how
large a shadow our beloved James Bond casts.
-SEAN CZARNECKI


Best Fjim Characters of 2012

1 Calvin Candie 2 Raul Silva

There's something about Quentin Tar-
antino and evil men. I can't tell if it's the
sharp dialogue or just the palpable gid-
diness that comes hand-in-hand , with
watching one of his movies. Whatever
the reason, Tarantino's most twisted
characters are all indelibly hilarious. And
because they're all so damn funny, their
ostensibly inhuman depravities become
tangible and, in many ways, real. Cal-
vin Candie, the lunatic plantation owner
Tarantino's latest masterpiece, is no
xception.
Unlike Hans Landa from "Inglourious.
Basterds," Candie is not an exceptionally
cunning individual. Suspicious? Yes, but
not in possession of the discerning detec-
tive's mind that made Landa lethal. But
what our southern friend lacks in sheer
force of wit, he makes up for in blunt rage
- a rage carefully bottled behind Leonar-
do DiCaprio's arched brows and laughing
eyes. But once all that vitriol comes flood-
ing out, completely convinced of its own
righteousness, we get a throttling taste of
what evil can become.

Let's be honest, there's something
slightly dry about the Bond series. The
martinis, the humor, the titular char-
acter, they're all so ... British. Which is
great. Who doesn't want to keep a stiff
upper lip? But even the driest of drinks
can occasionally use a dash of some-
thing sweet to keep us interested. Enter
the most recent Bond villain, Javier Bar-
dem's Silva.
"Skyfall" feels a bit slow until Silva
saunters in. His appearance is strik-
ing, almost ridiculous: flamboyant
bleached hair, almost touristy clothing;
Silva is eerily un-ruthless looking. His
face is animated; He talks with kissy
lips, graceful hands; He throws gre-
nades with a tiny flick of the wrist. It's
enthralling casual evil that is fascinat-
ing to watch.
Ultimately, Silva's disregard is what
draws us to him. He strokes Bond's
thigh (blasphemy!), he hunts the hunt-
ers, he burns his mother. Silva is naugh-
ty, demented and everythingthis storied
franchise needed.

3. Abraharm Lincoln
Though I'm well aware of Daniel
Day-Lewis's nonpareil talent, there's
no way I could have anticipated the
pure genius of his performance as
Abraham Lincoln in "Lincoln." It's like
the real deal came back from the dead
and decided to hop in front of a cam-
era. Day-Lewis looks like Lincoln; he
sounds like him, walks like him and
even - in multiples instances - sits like
him with his hands on his knees. It's a
purposeful performance that succeeds
in doing much more than simply mim-
icking the monument of one of Ameri-
ca's greatest historical figures.
Everything Day-Lewis does is innate,
inherent and authentic, and I think if
the 16th President were to see his per-
formance, he'd approve, as this beyond
gifted actor remains scarily true and
"honest" to Abe. His vacillation between
the caring father to the patient husband
to the empathetic political figure to the
intimidating commander-in-chief is
seamless and Oscar-worthy. He has my
vote at least.

4., Freddie Quell
Joaquin Phoenix's Freddie Quell is a
wayward, neurotic sailor who tries his
best to mimic normalcy in post-World-
War-II America. Through the grit of
combat he has learned to be devious,
manipulative and, to some extent, even
maniacal.
He is cruel. He abuses himself. He
retreats into personal shadows and
confides with demons of a dark order.
But he's aware of his illness. Through
some veil of feigned reality, Freddie
Quell knows he's twisted. So he forces
himself to experiment with religion,
friendship and community in a wild
attempt at self-healing.
While it's hard to watch a man so dis-
gruntled, so far gone into the realm of
paranoia try to become ordinary, Phoe-
nix makes it equally fascinating. He
does nothing right but in every failing,
there's a need for redemption.
And the great paradox of Freddie
Quell is how a man so broken and per-
turbed can ultimately be so spectacu-
lar.

5. Bane
Bane - the seemingly inde-
structible villain who was, disap-
pointingly, oh-so-easily destroyed.
Despite his unfulfilling end in "The
Dark Knight Rises," this formidable
foe who promised to be every inch
more bad-ass than the Joker, if
not as delectably crazy, proved his
worth by very nearly destroying the
Batman twice.
This character couldn't have a
more apt name. Bane not only acts
as one of Batman's strongest ene-
mies yet, he surpasses his predeces-
sors by truly rendering the film's
titular character helpless for the
better part of the movie.
Without a doubt, Tom Hardy
("Inception") has to be credited for
making Bane as physically fearsome
as the Joker was mentally. Being a
villain of this "Batman" series is an
honor almost equal to that of being
a Bond villain, and with Hardy's
help, Bane proved that it's an honor
he deserved.
