THE STATEMENT

Piper Kerman, whose 
book inspired Netflix 

series, addresses 
packed Rackham

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

The Rackham Auditorium was 

packed to full capacity Tuesday 
night as Piper Kerman, author 

of “Orange is the New Black: 
My Time in a Women’s Prison,” 
spoke about her experience in the 
criminal justice system and mass 
incarceration in the United States.

Kerman’s memoir inspired the 

award-winning Netflix series of the 
same name. Created by Jenji Kohan, 
the show, now in its fourth season, 
features an Emmy Award-winning 
and -nominated cast. The series 
has received widespread critical 
acclaim for shedding light on prison 
conditions and the social effects of 

mass incarceration in the country.

The Netflix series follows the 

story of Piper Chapman, an upper-
class woman from New York who is 
sent to prison for several years after 
laundering drug money overseas. 
Kerman’s story is very similar.

After graduating from Smith 

College in 1992, Kerman said she 
felt lost and unsure of her career and 
became involved in trafficking drug 
money after entering a romantic 
relationship with an older woman 
who worked for an international 

drug ring. Their travels included 
locations such as Bali and Zurich.

Kerman now travels around 

the 
country 
advocating 
for 

prison reform and an end to 
mass incarceration. Kerman is 
a 
white, 
middle-class 
woman 

with 
a 
college 
education, 
a 

demographic statistically unlikely 
to be incarcerated, she said. But by 
writing about her time in prison, 
she said she hopes more people will 
have the drive to become informed 

IFC partners with 
campus groups for 
sessions on alcohol, 

sexual assault

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

The Interfraternity Council 

teamed 
up 
with 
several 

campus organizations to host 
an educational forum for new 
fraternity pledges on alcohol, 
cultural 
appropriation 
and 

sexual misconduct.

In the first discussion of its 

kind, around 450 fraternity 
pledges 
gathered 
in 
Angell 

Hall 
auditoriums 
for 
this 

mandatory seminar over nearly 
three hours Sunday afternoon. 
Pledges received presentations 
from the University Health 
Service, Expect Respect, the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center and their 
fellow fraternity members in a 
lecture format before breaking 

into small groups of about 25 for 
more intimate discussion.

IFC President Alex Krupiak, 

an LSA senior, organized the 
educational 
seminar 
after 

conceiving the idea in June. He 
said though many fraternity 
members do learn about these 
issues and ways to prevent them 
at some point in their first year, 
he wanted to give new pledges 
the tools to prevent harmful 
situations as soon as they join 
Greek life.

“The whole plan for the 

meeting 
was 
to 
get 
new 

members coming into the Greek 
community, specifically within 
IFC, to have some education 
right away,” Krupiak said. “I 
really wanted to extend to them 
education 
right 
when 
they 

are stepping into the Greek 
community because they are a 
part of our community and they 
are representing it as soon as 
they become new members.”

SAPAC student volunteer, said

Late, famous 

playwright honored 
with performance 
in namesake theater

By GRACE HAMILTON

Daily Arts Writer

Some pieces of art, despite 

changing 
times, 
tastes 
and 

popular 
culture, 
remain 

“timeless.” These works are ones 
that not only 
reflect, but also 
define culture. 

One 
of 

these is Arthur 
Miller’s 
1947 

play, “All My 
Sons.” 
From 

Oct. 9 to Oct. 18, 
the play returns 
to its birthplace 
to 
celebrate 

the 100th year of the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance and the 
centennial of Arthur Miller’s birth. 
SMTD has produced the play with 
a cast of 10 actors and director 
Wendy Goldberg. The premiere 

of the play last week kicked off 
a series of events in honor of the 
anniversaries. 

Playwright Arthur Miller is 

arguably one of the most important 
American makers of these works. 
His subtle critique of the American 
Dream and intimately recognizable 
characters are graspable to any 
audience. “All My Sons,” one of his 
earliest and most popular plays, 
perfectly captures his artisty and 
commentary. 

Based on true events, the 

story follows Joe Keller and 
his family. Joe authorized the 
sale of defective airplane parts 
during WWII, leading to 21 plane 
crashes. The blame, however, is 
put on Joe’s partner while he is 
exonerated. The family struggles 
with the grief of their lost son, 
Larry, as their youngest, Chris, 
prepares to propose to Larry’s 
ex-fiancée. In 24 hours, grief, guilt 
and moral dilemma unfold. 

“All My Sons” made its Broadway 

debut in 1947 as Miller’s second 
large professional production. His 
first had closed after only four 
performances in 1940, in what can 

College Democrats, 
Students for Sanders 
hold watch parties

By ALLANA AKHTAR 
and CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter 

and For the Daily

At the two public watch parties 

held on campus Tuesday night, 
students 
generally 
said 
they 

felt the first Democratic debate 
covered the most important 
issues. Even so, students were 

divided 
on 
whether 
former 

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 
or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders 
won the debate.

The University’s chapter of the 

College Democrats and Students 
for Sanders both held watch 
parties for Thursday’s debate, 
which aired on CNN. In addition 
to Clinton and Sanders, the two 
Democratic frontrunners, former 
Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, 
former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb 
and former Rhode Island Gov. 
Lincoln Chafee also participated.

The College Democrats’ watch 

party filled two large auditoriums 

in the Ford School of Public Policy, 
while a Students for Sanders 
event drew about 40 students 
to an apartment off-campus for 
pizza and drinks.

Aaron Kall, director of the 

University’s debate program, said 
he thought Clinton gave the best 
overall performance. He added 
that he thought the Democratic 
debate was less contentious than 
the Republican one, with far less 
negativity and back-and-forth 
between candidates.

starting point for determining the 
efficacy of current policies.

“We now how have, for the 

first 
time, 
University-specific 

information on unreported as well 
as reported behavior of sexual 
misconduct,” Rider-Milkovich said. 
“We now have a baseline which we 
could use going forward whether 
our activities taken as a whole 
have moved the needle on this 
unbelievably heartbreaking issue.”

Rider-Milkovich said SAPAC 

aims to increase the number 
of 
students 
reporting 
sexual 

misconduct 
by 
strengthening 

student confidence in SAPAC and 
improving its policies.

One change the University is 

considering is how witnesses are 
identified in ongoing investigations.

Currently, 
witnesses 
are 

identified as numbers in reports 
and 
documentation. 
The 

amendment to name each witness 
aims to increase due process and 
transparency so the accused can 
provide proper counter evidence.

Still, Rider-Milkovich said the 

policy could also have negative 
consequences.

“We also have contemplated 

the potential chilling effect of 
including the names of witnesses,” 
Rider-Milkovich said. “It could 
mean that fewer witnesses are 
willing to be witnesses, and that 
that could mean that we have less 
meaningful investigations.”

An 
amendment 
was 
also 

proposed 
to 
clarify 
witness’ 

obligation to provide truthful 
information. 
Witnesses 
are 

subject to disciplinary action if 
they 
knowingly 
provide 
false 

information under the statement.

“This is an articulation which 

is 
already 
the 
case,” 
Rider-

Milkovich said.

The draft policy also adds 

definitions and conditions.

Rider-Milkovich 
said 
the 

behavioral goals of SAPAC are 
different than their definition of 
consent, which she said is in line 
with the University policy.

“I’m not going to relinquish 

that we do have better goals,” 
Rider-Milkovich 
said. 
“The 

threshold 
(for 
consent) 
is 

clear 
and 
and 
unambiguous 

agreement expressed in mutually 
understandable words of actions to 
engage in an activity.”

Rider-Milkovich said the hope 

for all students is that consent is 
sober and enthusiastic.

In evaluating whether consent is 

confirmed, amendments regarding 
incapacitation 
aim 
to 
clarify 

whether the respondent knew or 
reasonably should have known 
the person was incapable of giving 
consent.

Rider-Milkovich said there have 

been no proposals to change the 
definition of consent, but definitions 
for incapacitation, coercion and 
force would been clarified.

She 
said 
these 
improved 

definitions will allow students to 
clearly understand what behavior 

violates the statement.

In the policy, incapacitation is 

defined as deriving from more than 
just alcohol intake.

The University intends to enact 

a revised policy by winter semester, 
and the University plans to seek 
input on the draft policy during 
several 
roundtable 
discussions 

scheduled in the coming weeks.

BAMN resolution

The group By Any Means 

Necessary discussed a resolution 
on Tuesday calling on University 
President Mark Schlissel to make 
the University a sanctuary campus, 
which 
means 
the 
University 

would not use its resources to help 
the federal government enforce 
immigration laws.

The resolution was officially 

proposed by Rackham student 
Lamin 
Manneh, 
a 
Rackham 

student representative.

Manneh said the resolution is 

relevant given a recent proposal 
in state legislature to defund 
sanctuary cities like Ann Arbor 
and Detroit. The resolution calls on 
Schlissel and the Board of Regents 
to issue a declaration of support 
on behalf of those cities, as well as 
asks the University to provide free 
legal services to undocumented 
students through a sanctuary 
student center.

“These are people who usually 

have parents that have come here 
illegally, but they have grown up 
here, and many times their parents 
pay taxes,” Manneh said. “Now

Princeton DPS to have rifles

WEDNESDAY:

In Other Ivory Towers

In an effort to update 

its 
method 
of 
response 

in the case of an active 
campus shooter, Princeton 
University will give officers 
in its Department of Public 
Safety access to rifles in 
emergency 
situations, 
the 

Daily Princetonian reported 
Monday.

DPS Executive Director 

Paul Ominsky announced the 
new policy at a meeting of 
the Council of the Princeton 
University 
Community 

— 
a 
body 
comprising 

undergraduates, 
graduate 

students, 
faculty 
and 

administrators.

“The 
national 
best 

practices 
for 
responding 

to an active shooter have 
evolved,” Ominsky said. “It 
is now a law enforcement 
best practice to get an armed 
officer to the scene as quickly 
as possible to save lives.”

California governor 

bans concealed weapons on 

college campuses

California 
Gov. 
Jerry 

Brown 
signed 
legislation 

over the weekend to prohibit 
concealed weapons in schools 
and on college campuses, the 
Daily Bruin reported.

People 
with 
concealed 

weapons 
permits 
were 

previously 
permitted 
to 

carry on campuses and were 

exempted from the Gun-
Free School Zone Act. The 
University 
of 
California 

system sent a letter to the 
governor 
in 
September 

advocating for the ban.

The legislation comes a 

week after a shooter at a 
community college in Oregon 
killed nine people.

Last month, the University 

of Michigan filed a court brief 
defending its policy not to 
follow the state’s open carry 
laws, which allow those with 
open carry permits to bring 
guns into public places.

University to receive papers 
of noted euthanasia advocate

Jack Kevorkian’s 
documents will be 
available at Bentley 
Historical Library

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Papers belonging to the late 

Jack Kevorkian, a University 
alum and prominent euthanasia 
activist, will be donated to the 
Bentley Historical Library on 
North Campus, the University 
announced Tuesday.

Donated to the University by 

Kevorkian’s niece, Ava Janus, 
the documents include corre-
spondence, 
published 
works, 

manuscript drafts, photos, court 
records, news coverage and 
interviews 
from 
Kevorkian’s 

career as a promoter of “medi-
cide,” or assisted suicide.

The digitalized documents 

are available to the public, many 
of which contain medical his-
tories, photos, video and audio 
recordings of consultations with 
Kevorkian’s patients.

Kevorkian, who passed away 

in June 2011, aided more than 
130 voluntary suicides through-
out his career, after which he 
spent eight years in prison for 
second-degree murder.

Born to Armenian immigrants 

in Pontiac, Kevorkian attended 
the University’s Medical School. 
In addition to his career in 
pathology and euthanasia medi-
cine, Kevorkian was a composer, 
musician and scientist.

In a statement, Terrence 

McDonald, director of the Bent-
ley Historical Library, said these 
documents will help the pub-
lic learn about the motivation 
behind Kevorkian’s controver-
sial career.

“The release of his papers will 

allow scholars and students to 

understand the context of and 
driving forces in an interesting 
and provocative life,” he said.

Olga Virakhovskaya, Bentley’s 

lead archivist, recently spoke to 
the Society of American Archi-
vists on the ethical consider-
ations surrounding the Bentley 
Library’s decision to make these 
files public.

“Many 
of 
the 
medicide 

patients and their families — 
who remain very close to this 
day — are still advocates of their 
family member’s choice to die, 
so anonymity was not an issue,” 
Virakhovskaya said. “We felt 
very strongly that by not provid-
ing access to this collection and 
to the medicide files, we would 
be choosing to hide a very impor-
tant story.”

The 
Bentley 
Historical 

Library promotes the study of 
the University and the state of 
Michigan and has a conservation 
lab for books and papers.

different candidates,” he said.

Public 
Policy 
senior 
Max 

Lerner, chair of the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats, said 
the Democratic debate was more 
productive compared with the 
Republican debate because of the 
smaller number of people on stage.

“I think not having a clown show 

of 10 or 11 different candidates 
actually allows us to dive deeper 
into the issues, and I think we’re 
going to have a stronger nominee 
because of it,” he said.

Public 
Policy 
senior 
Cody 

Giddings, chair of the College 
Republicans, wrote in an e-mail 
interview 
that 
the 
smaller 

Democratic field allowed the 
moderator to address a more 
diverse array of topics compared 
to the previous two Republican 
debates, but felt foreign policy 
should 
have 
received 
more 

attention.

“The debate was somewhat 

interesting to watch and covered 
a few important issues,” he said. 
“I look forward to seeing the rest 
of the debates throughout the 
campaign season and I hope that 
republicans and democrats can 
come together to address some the 
very hard issues we will all face 
moving forward.”

College tuition

Sanders 
and 
Clinton 
both 

stressed the importance of an 
affordable college degree, but 
they disagreed on how much of a 
student’s tuition should be funded 
through taxes.

Sanders said a college degree 

today is equivalent to what a high 
school degree was 50 years ago, 
and therefore should be available 
for every student regardless of his 
or her family’s income.

“What we said 50 years ago and 

100 years ago is that every kid in 
this country should be able to get 
a high school education regardless 
of their income,” Sanders said. “I 
think we have to say that is true for 
everybody going to college.”

Students 
applauded 
when 

Sanders added that taxes on “Wall 
Street speculation” — or risky 
financial transactions — would 
fund those degrees.

Clinton supports tuition-free 

public colleges. However, her plan 
would require students with aid 
to work at least 10 hours a week 
to help fund their education. 
Clinton’s plan would also allow all 
students with debt to refinance in 
order to lower interest rates.

“My 
plan 
would 
enable 

anyone to go to a public college or 
university tuition-free,” she said.

Kall said the discussion on 

college affordability failed to 
elaborate on funding mechanisms 
and the feasibility of the proposed 
education policy reforms and said 
he expected more discussion about 
the likelihood of such a bill passing 
through a Republican-controlled 
Congress.

“I thought there would be 

some 
more 
discussion 
about 

the affordability of it,” Kall said. 
“Exactly how it’s going to be paid 
for, if there are going to be other 
programs that were cut to pay for it.”

Last 
July, 
the 
University’s 

Board of Regents increased tuition 
by 2.7 percent for in-state students 
and 3.7 percent for out-of-state 
students. Overall, base tuition for 
LSA students has increased 60 
percent for in-state students and 
55 percent for out-of-state students 
from 2005 to 2014.

Rackham 
student 
Shawn 

Danino, an organizer of the 
Students for Sanders watch party 
held on campus, said Sanders’ 
positions on higher education have 
been more aggressive compared to 
other candidates. He said Sanders’ 
desire to make college free for 
all students is a reason for his 
strong support from the college 
demographic.

“The reason there’s so much 

momentum with Bernie across 
millennials is largely because of 
his stances on student loans and 
his stances on debt,” Danino said.

Lerner said positions on higher 

education held by Democratic 
candidates were better than those 
held by Republican candidates. He 
said Republican budget positions 
on education do not reflect the 
values of students. He pointed 
to the House Budget Committee 
chairman, Rep. Paul Ryan (R–
Wis.), whose 2016 fiscal budget 
would cut funding for education 
by $145 billion over 10 years.

“Democrats 
are 
really 
the 

only party out there fighting for 
students on the issue of education,” 
Lerner said. “I think regardless of 

who the nominee is, we’re going 
to have a party that represents the 
interests of students.”

Giddings, 
the 
College 

Republicans 
chair, 
said 
he 

disagreed with the candidates’ 
plans 
to 
increase 
college 

affordability.

“I think Bernie Sanders’ goal of 

providing a college level education 
to every American that wants 
one is noble, but in my mind 
his proposals to simply make 
college tuition free are rooted in 
a fundamental misunderstanding 
of basic economic principles,” he 
said. “Contrary to what was said 
for the majority of the democratic 
presidential debate, implementing 
higher taxes is not the answer to 
every problem America faces and 
rising college tuition costs is no 
exception.”

Undocumented students

The 
candidates 
were 
also 

asked about their positions on 
allowing universities to grant 
in-state tuition for undocumented 
immigrant students, a measure 
which the University’s Board of 
Regents passed in 2013.

Martin 
O’Malley 
took 
the 

strongest stance in favor of 
undocumented students gaining 
in-state tuition.

“The more children learn, the 

more they earn,” O’Malley said.

Though Clinton agreed with 

O’Malley, she said states should 
drive those policies.

LSA 
sophomore 
Nicholas 

Kolenda, president of Students 
for Sanders, said he supports the 
Democratic candidates’ positions 
on granted the same tuition fees 
to undocumented students as 
citizens.

“I do completely agree with 

Sanders and O’Malley on the 
position that if they are working 
to become naturalized citizens, 
then, yes, they should receive free 
education,” Kolenda said.

Gun control

The candidates also touched 

on gun control when asked about 
the recent shooting at Umpqua 
Community College in Oregon, 
which left nine people dead.

Ann Arbor open carry advocate 

Joshua Wade is currently suing the 
University for violating Michigan’s 
open carry law when it denied 
his right to carry his firearm 
on campus. Because Michigan 

allows people with concealed 
carry permits to carry guns in 
public areas, such as schools and 
churches, Wade and his lawyer say 
the University should allow him 
the right to carry his weapon.

Debate moderator Anderson 

Cooper asked Sanders about his 
voting history on gun control, 
pointing out that he opposed the 
Brady Bill, which established 
background checks on firearms. 
Sanders said he voted the way he 
did because Vermont is a rural 
state where guns are used for 
recreation.

LSA 
senior 
Stephen 

Culbertson, 
communications 

chair of College Democrats, 
said he believes gun control 
is an important issue and one 
that 
Democrats 
offer 
better 

legislation on than the majority 
of Republicans.

“Republicans shied away from 

gun control policies because 
most of the candidates, if not all 
of them, on that stage are very at 
odds with what the vast majority 
of voters in America believe 
about gun control,” Culbertson 
said.

Giddings said he doesn’t think 

proposals raised by Democratic 
candidates would prove effective 
or legal.

“Gun control is a very salient 

and complex issue,” he said. 
“Although we need to do more to 
ensure that background checks, 
gun 
registries, 
and 
mental 

health care prevent the types of 
gun-related violence that have 
become much too commonplace 
in America, the simple blanket 
bans proposed in tonight’s debate 
are not only unconstitutional 
but ineffective at addressing the 
roots of the problem.” 

and exclusion are challenges that 
affect Greek life on campus and 
nationwide, working with the new 
members of Greek life can help 
curb these issues in the future.

“The reason behind working 

with new members was they had 
just joined and we saw this as an 
opportunity in this challenging 
time for Greek life to work with 
the new face of Greek life, this 
next generation, and send them 
into their experience with this 
knowledge so that they would be 
able to gradually influence their 
chapters,” Espinosa said.

SAPAC representatives gave 

the longest and most intensive 
presentation.

LSA senior Alison Bowman, a 

SAPAC student volunteer, helped 
lead the presentation. SAPAC 
outlined definitions of sexual 
misconduct and assault, defined 
explicit consent and introduced 
them to the concept of bystander 
intervention.

Bowman said SAPAC showed 

members the statistics of the 
University’s 
campus 
climate 

survey on sexual assault released 
in June which found sexual assault 

was 2.5 times more likely to impact 
Greek life members than other 
community 
members. 
SAPAC 

also noted how verbal pressure 
and intoxication were the biggest 
factors leading to sexual assault, 
according to the survey.

“We really wanted to make 

sure that the incoming IFC 
members were aware that sexual 
misconduct is a pervasive issue 
on our campus and to empower 
them to help prevent it,” she 
said. “We acknowledged that as 
incoming members to IFC, they 
are in a special position to take a 
stand against sexual misconduct 
that is occurring within their 
community, as well as our campus 
as a whole, and to continue to 
drive its prevalence down moving 
forward.”

LSA 
senior 
Scott 
Gillespie 

co-facilitated the dialogue on 
sexual misconduct. He said while 
speaking to these new pledges 
on the importance of consent, he 
tried to break the stereotypes of 
masculinity and sexual drive.

He said stepping into a harmful 

situation does not make a brother 
“less of a man,” and instead had 
the pledges list different values of 
being a man, which do not include 
sex drive or the ability to drink.

“Myself 
and 
the 
other 

co-facilitator 
gave 
no 
input, 

whatever they thought being a man 
was, we listed those on the board,” 
Gillespie said. “(It was about) 
taking those values that they 
described to us and what it means 
to be a man and implementing 
those into how would you deal 
with these situations as a man.”

CSG Vice President Steven 

Halperin, an LSA junior, also 
helped 
facilitate 
the 
SAPAC 

discussion, and used anecdotes to 
convey the importance of pledges 
stepping in to prevent sexual 
assault.

“It is your responsibility as a 

man to take care of the people 
around you, and that is what we 
were trying to explain to these 
guys,” Halperin said.

The pledges were given a brief 

presentation on alcohol abuse 
in fraternities, which debunked 
stereotypes of “party culture” 
within Greek life. Joy Pehlke, 
health educator at Wolverine 
Wellness at UHS, said many 
new fraternity members come 
into Greek life with the idea that 
party culture is solely about binge 
drinking. In her presentation, she 
stressed that these students can 
be in a safe environment and still 
have fun.

Lastly, pledges learned about 

cultural 
appropriation 
and 

respecting 
different 
identities 

through a discussion led by LSA 
senior Kidada Malloy, a program 
assistant with the Expect Respect 
campaign. 
With 
Halloween 

coming up, she focused on treating 
different identities and racial 
groups with respect to make for an 
inclusive environment.

Comparing 
this 
educational 

presentation 
to 
University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

community 
meeting 
earlier 

in 
September, 
Halperin 
said 

Sunday’s program was much 
more successful. Though both 
were mandatory, Halperin said, 
he found students on Sunday 
much more responsive because 
they were able to give their own 
input and not be talked down to by 
administrators.

“I feel like this is a step in the 

right direction; everyone is coming 
in to help, not to judge, not to talk 
down to,” Halperin said. “Greek 
life obviously has its issues and we 
are trying very hard to revamp it 
to make a culture of accountability 
and responsibility.”

Gillespie said the small group 

discussions made it easy to single 
out students who were not paying 
attention or being disrespectful, 
unlike the large assembly in 

September. Gillespie said he paid 
particular attention to making 
sure each student was attentive to 
the discussion because it is every 
single student’s responsibility to 
prevent harmful situations from 
occurring.

“It’s the people who are sitting 

by in corner not doing anything 
that’s really important and why 
these meetings are being held,” 
Gillespie said. “It is the same way 
that sexual assault does happen: 
by being passive, by not doing 
anything about it.”

Halperin 
admitted 
that 

SAPAC leaders who previously 
did 
not 
believe 
fraternity 

members 
could 
change 

their potentially destructive 
behavior told him they “had 
hope” after listening in to the 
meeting.

Halperin 
said 
though 

there are certainly problems 
associated with Greek life, he 
believes change will happen 
soon on campus within the 
community.

“We need to bring Greek life 

to the forefront of these issues, 
because that’s where most of 
these issues are from,” Halperin 
said. “If we do that successfully 
this year, I think we can have a 
special campus.”

University centers 
support struggling

For the first time, The Weiser 

Center for Europe and Eurasia 
and 
the 
William 
Davidson

NGO Leadership Bootcamp, a 
program dedicated to making 
organizations more sustainable 
for the leaders of 20 non-

organizations 

from 
countries 
that 
have 

recently undergone transitions to 
democracy. 

The program is scheduled 

to take place October 20-23 in

a 
Slovak-based 

NGO, is collaborating with the 
University in the planning of the 
event. 

In a press release, Amy Gillett, 

vice president of education at the

about criminal system injustices.

“Inequality is a huge driver of 

all of the things that contribute 
to people being in prison and the 
American criminal justice system 
is ironically sort of a crucible of 
American 
inequality,” 
Kerman 

said. “We have this expectation that 
everyone will be treated equally in 
the court of law, but we know that — 
particularly when we expand that 
into the criminal justice system as a 
whole not just the courts — you see 
quite the opposite.”

Women have been the fastest 

growing 
demographic 
in 
the 

criminal justice system, Kerman 
said, and 200,000 are currently 
imprisoned, of which two-thirds 
are incarcerated for nonviolent 
crimes. 
Kerman 
credits 
the 

Netflix series for fostering greater 
conversation about those women.

“Anything that reminds us 

that all these people we’ve chosen 
to lock away are, in fact, people 
and not felons and convicts and 
all these other labeling terms,” 
she said. “We’re much less likely 
to allow folks to continue to be 
dehumanized in the system. I’m 
very glad that there’s much more 
attention 
on 
criminal 
justice 

reform. I think that’s a long time 
coming.”

The United States has the 

highest prison population in the 
world. For every 100,000 people, 
724 are incarcerated, BBC News 
reported.

“I’ve 
never 
met 
a 
single 

American who is proud that we 
have the biggest prison population 
in human history, that we lock 
up more citizens than society has 
ever done,” Kerman said. “I think 
definitely that there’s an increasing 

consensus that that’s not we want 
to be.”

Kerman 
discussed 
three 

main points for reform: jail and 
court reform, reducing youths in 
juvenile prison and common sense 
sentencing.

“One of the things we have 

a lot of work to do on still is the 
sense that harsh punishment is 
something that works well for us 
as a culture,” she said. “A huge 
percentage of those people are 
mentally ill and the idea that we 
can confront problems in our 
society like substance abuse and 
addiction and mental illness with 
harsh punishment … is really 
questionable.”

Kerman said society’s reliance 

on prisons to root out violent crime 
is not an adequate solution to 
stifling those types of crimes from 
being committed.

“The idea that we rely on 

prisons, which tend to be very 

violent places, to fix that is just 
very dubious,” she said. “But, that’s 
a more substantive and cultural 
discussion above and beyond the 
tinkering with policy.”

Kerman, who teaches writing 

class at two different prisons 
in Ohio, noted the privilege 
University students have because 
of their access to libraries, art and 
public health centers.

“When we see communities that 

have those kinds of institutions 
… those communities tend to 
be vibrant and they are often 
prosperous,” she said. “And guess 
what? They also tend to be safe. 
When we see communities that 
lack those things and quite frankly 
have been deprived of those 
institutions, that’s where we see 
incredible over-reliance on prisons 
and on jails. So that’s something for 
you all to think about as you enjoy 
this amazing institution is to make 
sure that everybody gets access to 

a place like this who needs it.”

Rackham 
student 
Riya 

Seybrook said she was interested 
in Kerman’s emphasis on how race 
and class affects an individual’s 
likelihood of incarceration.

“She is a middle-class white 

women, so I think it would have 
been really easy for her to come 
in and not talk about that at all so 
I was really pleasantly surprised,” 
Seybrook said.

Eastern Michigan University 

student Elaine Barker said she was 
surprised by the number of women 
currently incarcerated and those 
who are on parole.

“That’s such a large number 

of women that are in prison, like 
why is the number going up?” 
Barker said. “Why is the number 
rising? I think that’s something 
that stood out to me the most. And 
the fact that half the women in jail 
are mothers, that’s something else 
that’s super horrible.”

they’re in college with us.”

Manneh said higher education is 

a path for undocumented students 
to become full-fledged citizens.

“This is about the fact that we 

have a certain number of students 
on our campus and because of the 
ways laws are set up, they have 
certain barriers to become full 
citizens,” Manneh said. “One of 
these barriers is higher education.”

Additional questions were raised 

about how the University would 
fund a sanctuary student center and 
whether the proposals have been 
discussed with Schlissel and the 
University’s Board of Regents.

Dining hall pilot program funded

CSG also passed a resolution 

to fund the dining hall game 
day pilot program. The program 
aims to open dining halls early 
in an effort to curb the impacts 
of risky drinking behavior on 
game days. CSG voted to allocate 
$10,000 from the Legislative 
Discretionary fund and $5,000 
from the Executive Discretionary 
fund for the program.

CSG treasurer Kevin Ziegler, 

an 
LSA 
senior, 
drafted 
the 

proposal.

Ziegler said CSG hopes to assist 

Michigan Dining with covering 
the cost of food consumed by 
students during the early hours 
and the cost of labor for opening 
the dining halls early.

Ziegler said Dining director 

Steve Mangan said in a meeting 
that 
the 
dining 
halls 
are 

supportive of the program.

“They want to help out in any 

way and serve the students,” 
Ziegler said. “That’s what they’re 
here for, to help the University in 
any capacity possible.”

Costs for early dining vary 

between game days depending 
the kick off time. Noon game days 
cost more than 3:30 p.m. games 
because they require dining halls 
to open even earlier.

T

ears were not uncommon 
during John Boehner’s ten-
ure as Speaker of the House. 

Whether 
he 

was 
attending 

statue unveiling 
ceremonies, sit-
ting next to golf 
legend 
Arnold 

Palmer 
in 
the 

Capitol Rotunda 
or listening to 
Irish traditional 
music 
at 
the 

White 
House 

St. Patrick’s Day 
celebration, 
the 

embattled Ohio Republican was 
never far from a box of Kleenex. 
However, this past weekend, it was 
his members who took to the GOP 
cloakroom to shed a few tears due 
to the confusion and unrest that has 
now taken hold in the House.

And the party is just getting 

started.

So political junkies and the news 

media should take a break from 
Election Watch 2016 — there will 
be plenty of coverage over the next 
13 months. Postpone talking about 
who’s ready for Hillary, speculating 
about whether or not Joe will jump in 
or being outraged at the latest hateful 
comment that’s fallen out of Trump’s 
mouth.

John Boehner is giving up his 

gavel at the end of October and 
another speaker of the House will be 
chosen. This person will have enor-
mous influence on the national politi-
cal discussion, the issues that are 
addressed by presidential candidates 
and which party might potentially 
win the majority next November.

What’s the most exciting part 

about this process? As of today, 
among the 247 Republican con-
gressmen, we have no idea who’s the 
favorite. It’s like March Madness and 
everyone is a 16-seed.

In the uncertainty that rules 

the GOP right now, only one thing 
is certain: The Freedom Caucus, a 
hyper-conservative group of about 
40 members, is a major player. This 
insurgency helped depose the some-
times-compromising Boehner and 
soon after played a part in forcing 
Kevin McCarthy, the heir apparent, 

to withdraw his candidacy. Largely 
identifying with the Tea Party, these 
diehard right-wingers have twice 
led the charge to a government shut-
down — once in 2011 over the debt 
ceiling and once in 2013 over Obam-
acare — and hope that three times is 
the charm with their recent rhetoric 
against Planned Parenthood.

This sequence of events has led to 

maybe the most interesting develop-
ment in the four years the GOP has 
controlled the House: a counter-rev-
olution. Moderate Republicans are 
standing up and, for the first time in 
recent memory, there seems to be a 
real interest in actually governing.

Rep. Charlie Dent (R–Pa.) suggest-

ed building a bipartisan coalition to 
elect the next speaker, saying, “Who-
ever’s going to be the next speaker 
should not appease this group of 
rejectionists, who have no interest 
in governing.” Rep. Tom McClintock 
(R–Calif.), who resigned from the 
Freedom 
Caucus 
in 
September, 

said, “I believe the tactics the HFC 
has 
employed 

have repeatedly 
undermined the 
House’s 
ability 

to advance (con-
servative 
prin-

ciples)” through 
“responsible 
and 
effective 

leadership,” 
as 

he had hoped 
at its inception 
 

in January.

Seniority, partisanship and lines 

of succession tend to rule in Wash-
ington D.C. How often do the Ameri-
can people get to see total chaos in 
their government? How often does 
the political intrigue that seems to 
only exist in House of Cards come to 
life? This is grade-A theater, and yet 
the headlines on every major news 
outlet are about 2016 — from Clinton 
e-mails and the Benghazi committee 
to which songs The Donald chooses 
to play at his campaign functions. 
Americans should stop looking miles 
down the road and notice the deci-
sive political moment that is happen-
ing right now.

Look no further for the personnel of 

the House GOP thought to be in wait-
ing for the speaker’s gavel. One is for-

mer vice presidential candidate Paul 
Ryan, who has said very clearly that he 
does not want the job. Another is Rep. 
Jason Chaffetz (R–Utah), who was 
absolutely embarrassed on late-night 
television after his behavior at hear-
ings on Planned Parenthood. He used 
a mathematically questionable graph 
that he got from an anti-abortion orga-
nization and then told the president of 
Planned Parenthood that the numbers 
were straight from her reports. When 
confronted, he simply moved on.

The most likely candidate, with 

the backing of the Freedom Cau-
cus, is Rep. Daniel Webster (R–Fla.). 
Webster briefly ran for Senate in 
2004, but failed to collect enough 
signatures to be on the ballot with-
out paying a fee. He ultimately paid 
the fee and dropped out soon after. It 
has been five years of party infight-
ing as conservatives begged for a new 
leader. Now their time has come, and 
there’s no one there to take the baton.

The Speaker of the House is 

third in line for the presidency and 

arguably 
the 

second-most 
powerful 
office in Wash-
ington. When 
his party is not 
in the White 
House, 
the 

Speaker is the 
face and voice 
of the oppo-
sition 
party. 

Republicans 

enter 2016 doing a considerable 
amount of soul-searching. Is the GOP 
really the party of the 1 percent? Why 
is Donald Trump leading in the polls? 
Which voice can help the party avoid 
three straight losses in presidential 
elections?

Whoever succeeds Boehner might 

be elected by bipartisan efforts and 
moderates in the House GOP. They 
might be a strong conservative, hand-
picked by the Freedom Caucus. They 
might be a name we’ve never heard 
before. Ostensibly, this entire drama 
will play out before Boehner steps 
down on Oct. 30.

I, for one, will be watching closely.

H

ow many male engineers 
would have chosen to 
major in computer sci-

ence if they knew 
they’d be work-
ing in a pink cubi-
cle accompanied 
by cosmopolitan 
magazines 
and 

gossip over last week’s “Pretty Little 
Liars”? Your guess is probably the 
same as mine: not many.

Most girls have this perception 

that if your career choice is centered 
on technology, you’ll be working in 
a dusty 9-by-10 with Dwight from 
“The Office” as your coworker. And 
similarly, guys tend to view careers 
in writing as the path to a lifetime 
of Cosmopolitan gossip in the office, 
which probably explains why once 
we reach upper-level Spanish and 
English classes, we don’t see as many 
male classmates as we would in the 
required lower-level courses.

In a recent New York Times arti-

cle, Eileen Pollack, a creative writing 
professor at the University, shared 
the reasons she left the scientific field 
early in her physics career: A work-
place atmosphere that included sex-
ist comments and teasing remarks 
on her gender identity created a gen-
eral aversion to a career she loved. 
Though it’s true that gender discrim-
ination still exists in male-dominat-
ed careers, Pollack suggested there 
could be a more overarching cause to 
her overall unhappiness in her work-
place — and it’s not the guys.

In her article, Pollack outlines 

extensive research that has been 
ongoing for the past six years head-
ed by Sapna Cheryan, a psychol-
ogy professor at the University of 
Washington. The research has been 
exploring not only why women are 
unhappy once they’re in technology 
related fields, but what deters them 
from entering these careers in the 

first place.

Not surprisingly, these research-

ers have found that environments 
with primarily neutral décor such as 
coffee makers, art posters and plants 
were more likely to lead to females 
enrolling 
in 
computer 
science 

courses than environments with 
“Star Wars” posters and technology 
magazines could. Also, most women 
found 
engineering-related 
fields 

more attractive after talking with a 
“student” wearing a normal T-shirt 
who chatted about his or her social 
life over the student with a T-shirt 
bearing the quote “I code, therefore I 
am” who raved about technology the 
entire conversation.

I can relate to this sensitivity to 

environment: Personally, I study 
better with natural light and light 
chatter, while my roommate studies 
better with flu-
orescent bulbs 
and silence. My 
environment 
significantly 
affects my abil-
ity to perform a 
specific task.

In 
a 
simi-

lar sense, our 
attraction to a 
particular field 
and willingness 
to join that field 
relies heavily upon our perceptions 
of what the experience of going to 
work every day would be like. What 
would our coworkers be like to work 
with, and what kind of environment 
would we have to work in all day?

Even perceptions of what a com-

puter science or physics major “looks 
like” can lead to fewer females plan-
ning on a career in science. It seems 
like our perception of what a scientist 
is hasn’t changed much in the past 70 
years, as the first thing that comes to 
mind is usually that of a male with a 

microscope. On the other hand, Eng-
lish teachers are most often viewed 
as kind, older women. Not only can a 
workplace environment keep females 
from pursuing a STEM degree in col-
lege, but so could these stereotypes.

Instead of going into the tech-

nology field, such preconceptions 
could cause college females to con-
centrate on the majors they think 
they’d best “fit into,” such as English 
and Spanish. You could theoretical-
ly argue that they should have the 
strength or determination to con-
tinue in their studies despite these 
restrictions, but the same theory 
applies to men, who build off of the 
same stereotypes as women. What 
15-year-old girl wants to be stereo-
typed as a man with nerd glasses, 
and conversely, what 15-year-old 
male wants to tell his friends he’s 

going to be 
“just like Mrs. 
Anderson”? 

Unfortu-

nately, 
tech 

companies 
with predom-
inantly male 
workforces 
will 
find 

themselves 
unable 
to 

grant 
posi-

tions 
to 

females if they never enter the field 
in the first place, despite females 
testing highly in these subjects. An 
updated view on what a career in 
technology entails is long overdue 
for a makeover, both internally and 
externally. The future depends on 
the decisions we will make today 
— changes that should accom-
modate all genders, not based on 
 

majority rules.

T

his semester has brought welcome changes to Counseling 
and Psychological Services. A new embedded model has 
brought CAPS services beyond the Michigan Union and 

to locations that need them the most, especially on North Campus. 
Furthermore, last week’s launch of a hotline, which is meant to 
provide psychological services to students during hours when the 
CAPS office is closed, is especially commendable for its recognition 
that students need mental health support at all times — not just 8 
a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays.

An all-night expansion 

CAPS must be transparent in changes to mental health services

While 
CAPS 
and 
the 
University 

administration should be applauded for 
their commitment to expand mental health 
services around campus, these new services 
are not perfect. The hotline is actually run 
through ProtoCall, a national and privately 
owned company that other universities use 
for similar purposes. CAPS should be sure 
to remind students that when they use this 
new hotline, they will not be speaking to a 
member of the University community.

Instead, they will be speaking to an 

offsite contractor, who is a mental health 
professional but may not understand the 
nuances of the University’s campus in the 
same way CAPS’ staff does. While these 
professionals will have the knowledge to 
refer students to on-campus resources, the 
use of off-site support does raise the question 
of why CAPS cannot use the same model as 
the Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness 
Center’s 24-hour crisis hotline, which is 
monitored by SAPAC staff.

Furthermore, this service will only be 

available when CAPS’ physical offices are 
closed. Those students who take extra com-
fort in access to confidential mental health 
services without having to show their face 
in a clinic will have access to services they 
desire, but not at all times.

This isn’t to say CAPS’ recent improve-

ments are not without merit. On Oct. 8, CAPS 
and the University hosted a National Depres-
sion Screening Day, which deserves com-
mendation for its ease of accessibility and 
proactive approach to helping students suf-
fering from depression.

However, while CAPS is making several 

strides in improving its student services, the 
lack of consistent information regarding the 
wait time for consultations is concerning. 
Last night, CAPS’ “When Can I Be Seen?” 
page listed the wait time for an Initial Con-
sultation at 11 business days. However, the 
“Counseling Options” page, detailing what 
exactly appointments entail, lists the wait 
time as one to three days. This inconsistency 
presents extra challenges for students direct-
ed to CAPS, especially for a student unsure of 
what their free online screening might mean.

CAPS’ recent shift to a culture of improve-

ment should be applauded after years of trou-
blingly and sometimes unreliable services. 
But for mental health services to have the 
reach and impact this campus so desperately 
deserves today, CAPS needs to be more trans-
parent by doing two things: explaining to stu-
dents that the ProtoCall hotline will not be 
monitored by University staff and clarifying 
wait times on the CAPS website.

DAILY BOOK REVIEW
Iconoclast Žižek’s 
‘Paradise’ incites

Slovenian 

philosopher discusses 
contemporary politics

By KARL WILLIAMS

Online Arts Editor

It is said that a philosopher’s 

work is his life, and personal-
ity and biography are irrelevant. 
But 
in 
the 

peculiar 
case 

of 
Slovenian 

Communist 
philosopher 
and 
cultural 

theorist Slavoj 
Žižek, person-
ality interjects.

Described 

in The New York Times as the 
“Elvis of Cultural Theory,” Žižek 
occupies a fascinating place in 
public life: the celebrity philoso-
pher, a role which he uses and 
abuses with relish. Among his 
many provocations, he has told 
students that they’ll get an A if 
they spare him the agony of read-
ing their shitty papers; he has 
written a catalog for Abercrom-
bie and Fitch, where half-naked 
youth graze in an idyll of flowers 
and Hegelian dialectics. He has 
also hung a picture of Stalin so 
it’s the first thing one sees in his 
apartment (at one point in this 
book he writes, “better the worst 
of Stalinism than the best of the 
liberal-capitalist welfare state”). 
Furthermore, he has starred in 
documentaries (“The Pervert’s 
Guide to Ideology” is on Netflix) 
where he applies generous layers 
of Marx, Hegel and Lacan to Hol-
lywood classics.

Inevitably, this Falstaff of phi-

losophy lends himself to carica-
ture, in which his critics indulge. 
However, Žižek’s books fascinate 
as much, if not more, than the 
man, and if they don’t quite turn 
readers over to Communism, 
they’ll compel them to question 
their basic political assumptions. 
There’s a reason he has been 

called the most dangerous phi-
losopher in the West. His latest 
work “Trouble in Paradise: From 
the End of History to the End of 
Capitalism,” released in the US 
after publication in the U.K. last 
year, is no exception.

In “Trouble in Paradise,” Žižek 

tackles his usual suspects: West-
ern neoliberal capitalism — or 
capitalism with a human face. He 
covers the possibility of ecological 
catastrophe, popular entertain-
ment, global protests, political 
cynicism and indifference, glo-
balization, the Arab spring, the 
2008 financial crash and, of 
course, the possibility of a Com-
munist emancipatory revolution. 
He supplements them with some 
new characters: the suicide rate 
in South Korea, Psy’s music video 
for “Gangnam Style,” WikiLeaks 
and “Abraham Lincoln Vampire 
Slayer,” among others.

Žižek fills this book, like his 

others, with his favorite jokes. 
Many of these, which come from 
sources like the Marx Brothers 
or the Soviet Union, are repeated 
elsewhere. In fact, many of the 
book’s ideas have been discussed 
in his previous work, which is 
partly redundant, yet a fair sum-
mation of his thought. For new 
readers, “Trouble in Paradise” 
provides a cogent, concise intro-
duction to Žižek’s work. For vet-
eran readers though, it could be a 
tiresome echo.

The “paradise” in the title is 

Francis Fukuyama’s infamous 
idea of the End of History, pos-
ited after the fall of the Soviet 
Union. The End of History stipu-
lates that, after the collapse of the 
USSR, Western liberal democracy 
became the final form of human 
government. 
However, 
Fuku-

yama would later drop this idea. 
Žižek believes that, despite the 
many apples produced by neolib-
eral capitalism, few — about one 
percent — are satisfied, and we 
need a change: “Radical eman-
cipatory engagement starts from 
the premise that it is the capital-
ist dynamics which are boring, 

offering more of the same in the 
guise of constant change, and 
that the struggle for emancipa-
tion is still the most daring of all 
ventures. Our goal is to argue for 
this second option.”

The “guise of constant change” 

is liberal progressivism. A fer-
vent lover of the counterintuitive 
observation, he believes that lib-
eral progressives — not Reaganite 
Republicans — keep capitalism 
functioning because they refuse 
to admit systemic problems. They 
just want to tinker with the sys-
tem and solve the local problems. 
Thus, liberalism becomes a way 
of delaying a necessary political 
crisis, of staving off any emanci-
patory event.

Žižek has a manic intelligence 

and an encyclopedic mind. It is 
characteristic Žižek’s writing to 
cover as many topics as possible, 
to gather as much of culture as he 
can into his critique. The result is 
a curious farrago of high and low 
culture, equal parts Batman and 
Marxist theory. His prose style is 
schizophrenic; readers can start 
a sentence in Lacanian theory, 
detour through “The Sound of 
Music” and end up in Brazilian 
favelas. He doesn’t so much write 
as ramble — but it’s a shockingly 
lucid rambling. He rarely gets lost 
in the labyrinths of his erudition.

While “Trouble in Paradise” 

is neither as long nor as arcane 
as some of Žižek’s other works, 
such as “Less than Nothing” or 
“Absolute Recoil,” the book can 
get tiresomely technical. How-
ever, what sustains it is Žižek’s 
brilliant evaluations of the con-
temporary world’s political situ-
ation, like the turmoil in Greece, 
communist-cloaked capitalism in 
China and the Arab Spring and 
Mubarak’s fall in Egypt.

“Trouble in Paradise,” and all 

of Žižek’s work, would benefit 
anyone who gives it a read. He’s 
one of the few heterodox political 
thinkers in a placid sea of ortho-
doxy. At times, he may come off as 
ridiculous, but at least he is trou-
bling the water.

‘Bang 3 Part 2’ sees 
free Keef spitting fire

INTERSCOPE

His music is as good as those pants.

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

Last week, Chief Keef released 

an unexpected follow-up to his 
sophomore album, Bang 3, clev-
erly titled Bang 3 Part 2. The 
album confirmed my suspicions 
surrounding Chief Keef for the 
last year or so: he’s good. While 
he has built up a solid reputa-
tion for churning out countless 
mixtapes, many haven’t seemed 
to notice his slow but steady 
development from gun-wielding 
kindergartener to surprisingly/
composed songwriter.

Keef’s video for “Don’t Like” 

was already circulating around 
Chicago in 2012, but he didn’t 
present himself on the national 
stage until Kanye West remixed 
the 
song 
(and 
subsequently 

included him as one of few fea-
tures on Yeezus ). Keef was 17 at 
the time and still on house arrest 
for allegedly shooting at police at 
age 15. He also had his first child 
at 16. Point being, he came from 
the most violent neighborhood in 
the country and was thrust into a 
competitive hip-hop landscape as 
a teenager. We’ve since been for-
tunate enough to witness his evo-
lution from someone who publicly 
joked about the death of fellow 
Chicagoan and teen rapper, Lil 
JoJo, to making “Finding Nemo” 
references on his latest project.

Following the success of his 

debut album, Finally Rich, it 
seems Keef followed a com-
pletely unforeseen but positive 
trajectory for an artist of his 
background. He took his money 

(and his daughter), moved to a 
wealthy Chicago suburb and has 
since been focusing on music. 
Imagine that.

To the untrained ear (or con-

servative hip-hop heads), Keef’s 
newer and more playful tunes 
might provoke a similar reac-
tion to work from his teenage 
years: “same shit.” Yet, listen-
ing to Bang 3 Part 2, I couldn’t 
help but walk around campus 
laughing at bars like “Something 
something something, I forgot 
now / I was thinking ‘bout the 
guac, then pulled my guap out.” 
The absurdity of Keef thinking 
about guacamole while count-
ing money automatically makes 
“Bouncin” one of his most 
memorable records to date. The 
lyric couldn’t have even existed 
on his earlier mixtapes; before 
the money, the only thing Keef 
could’ve brought into the studio 
with him was violence.

It’s almost as if he’s in on the 

joke these days — a remarkable 
turnaround, given that in 2012, 
he was arrested for foolishly 
conducting an interview at a gun 
range … while on parole. He’s 
been on the receiving end of so 
many distasteful jokes that it’s 
great to see him start rapping 
tongue-in-cheek. The opening 30 
seconds of “Pee Pee’d” show him 
yelling, “I’m so damn ignorant / 
I pulled out my ding-a-ling and 
start pee peeing.” Yes, really.

And then there’s the sheer 

quality of the mixtapes that he 
has been throwing around for 
free. “Ten Toes Down” is buried 
somewhere in the middle of Sorry 

4 The Weight and begins with a 
monologue so unlikely that I had 
to run it back a few times: “I just 
need to be happy … I come from 
nothing / I come from ghetto / I 
come from projects / If I’m in my 
mansion, best believe I’m work-
ing … That’s all I need to be happy: 
work / I’mma never stop working, 
I’mma keep perfecting my craft.” 
All this comes before a beat that 
thumps so hard it rattles your 
skull at half-volume. He fades 
out of his last verse with “If you 
looking for me / I’m prolly’ on the 
news.” How’s that for awareness? 
Well played, Keef.

Chief Keef deserves far more 

credit than he gets because he’s 
not still supposed to be in that 
mansion. Like Dr. Dre said earli-
er this year on Kendrick Lamar’s 
“Wesley’s 
Theory,” 
“Anybody 

can get it / the hard part is keep-
ing it.” Despite being in and out of 
jail for five years, being dropped 
from his label, having his life 
threatened and being exploited 
by the music industry as a teen 
parent, Keef cleaned up his act 
and focused on music.

Most importantly, he stuck 

to his roots. Throughout the 
various phases of his personal 
life, Keef has sustained an out-
standing level of honesty and 
transparency through his music, 
creating a narrative that’s simul-
taneously horrifying, uplifting 
and hilarious. Chief Keef might 
live in the ‘burbs, but at least he 
still rides ATVs on his neigh-
bors’ lawns. At least he still 
smokes blunts in public. At least 
he’s still in that mansion.

FILM REVIEW

‘Wildlike’ disturbs

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

When the two protagonists 

of “Wildlike” encounter a bear 
during their Alaskan expedition, 
Mackenzie 
(Ella 
Purnell, 

“Maleficient”) 
suddenly 
remembers 
her companion 
Rene’s 
(Bruce 

Greenwood, 
“Star Trek Into 
Darkness”) 
most important 
rule of the trail: 
don’t run. 

 This decree is in direct contrast 

to Mackenzie’s natural instincts 
to flee under pressure. After the 
death of her father, her mother’s 
addiction issues strips her of 
parental abilities, sending the 
14-year-old to live with her uncle 
in Alaska. She arrives with a quiet 
and untrusting disposition and a 
full face of raccoon-eqsue makeup, 
a shield from her circumstances. 
Uncle (Brian Geraghty, “Chicago 
P.D.”), who is never given a proper 
name, begins to sexually abuse 
Mackenzie. So when the opportu-
nity arises, Mackenzie takes her 
chances and runs. 

 Even with her limited finan-

cial resources and lack of shelter, 
Mackenzie is determined to return 
to her mother in Seattle. She sleeps 
in cars and breaks into strangers’ 
hotel rooms. During one of these 

break-ins, she meets her reluctant 
ally, Rene. At first, he wants noth-
ing to do with the surly teen who 
insists on following him. But even-
tually, the two slowly build a grow-
ing trust and familial compassion 
for each other. Mackenzie even 
drops her shield of dark eyeliner, 
allowing Rene to be the first per-
son to see her natural face. 

 The film delicately approaches 

the Mackenzie as a young girl 
prematurely forced into her sexu-
ality, with finesse. Mackenzie’s 
body is suddenly transformed into 
a commodity, and her agitation is 
evident in every relationship with 
men she encounters after Uncle 
violates her. The scenes where 
Uncle takes advantage of her are 
not exploitative or sexualized; the 

fact that her attacker is given such 
a vague name lends the film uni-
versality in this matter. It high-
lights the concept that abuse is not 
limited to those who match tradi-
tional schemas of abusers. 

 “Wildlike” is a quiet film. There 

is sparse dialogue, the characters 
mostly using facial expressions and 
body language to communicate 
complex emotion. The conversa-
tions that do exist are very hushed, 
but this choice matches Mackenzie 
and Rene’s reticent personalities. 
While the pair clearly have a famil-
ial bond, their relationship is not 
overworked for dramatic effect. 
“Wildlike” allows its characters to 
develop themselves and their con-
nections in a realistic manner — at 
their own pace.

FILM REVIEW
‘Walk’ retreads old 
ground in new ways

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

There are hundreds of ways to 

tell a story.

 This seems obvious, but it 

becomes more 
apparent than 
ever 
while 

watching “The 
Walk,” 
“Cast-

away” 
direc-

tor 
Robert 

Zemeckis’s 
fantastical 
re-creation of 
Philippe Petit’s 
1974 tightrope 
walk between the Twin Tow-
ers. The film’s tone is almost 
mythic, and it focuses on Petit 
(Joseph Gordon-Levitt, “Incep-
tion”) instead of the act itself. 
Because “The Walk” was pre-
ceded by a 2008 documentary 
(“Man on Wire”) covering the 
same events, Zemeckis makes 
the decision to stray on the side 
of fairytale, pulling the narra-
tive structure away from a more 
realistic telling. 

 The plot is simple, but it holds 

its excitement in the details of 
Philipe’s goals, which must be con-
figured to make the final, incred-
ible wire-walk possible. Since he 
was a boy, Petit dreamed of being a 
successful wire-walker — but with 
a catch. Instead of being perceived 
as a circus performer, he hopes 
his walks will be received as art 
— a performance to showcase the 
impossible as possible — to merge 
reality with dreams. As he reflects 
on the nature of art, he travels 
around France performing on the 
streets until he sees an advertise-
ment for the newly-constructed 
Twin Towers one day. He becomes 

determined to organize a coup and 
walk between the towers, amass-
ing a group of artists and other 
assistants to break into the build-
ings. Working for months to devise 
a plan and engineer the wire 
between the buildings, Petit car-
ries the audience with him from 
the initial idea to his iconic walk 
before the entire world. 

 Petit stands as a dynamic, 

larger-than-life character whose 
desire to showcase the art of wire-
walking drives the entire film 
forward. He performs his daring 
and beautiful stunts far above the 
cities, first walking between the 
towers of Notre Dame and even-
tually between the Twin Towers 
— and it seems the film’s stunning 
visual effects would pull attention 
from the character and onto the 
spectacle of the feats themselves. 
However, the focus remains on 
Philipe’s emotions: his pride in 
these moments and the determina-
tion to continue walking.

 The film’s strength comes from 

its ability to characterize Petit in 
relation to the surrounding city 

spaces. He is constantly shown 
holding a string between any two 
standing objects, figuring where 
he can next hang his wire and per-
form. By integrating Petit into the 
cities that surround him, Zemeckis 
reflects his imaginative character 
in the fantasy of the countryside, 
the creative inspiration of living 
in a vibrant city like Paris and the 
grit and determination from the 
streets of NYC. Instead of out-
lining these qualities through 
an overabundance of action and 
dialogue, the film keeps Petit’s 
character action-driven, answer-
ing the “why” behind many of his 
absurd stunts through the places 
he assimilates to. 

 “The carrots are cooked,” as the 

French characters throughout the 
film say. The act has already been 
done, and it may seem that return-
ing to an already-dramatized story 
is a futile act. However, through 
the imaginative narrative style, 
focus on character and dream-
like special effects, “The Walk” is 
able to successfully re-examine an 
already famous story.

Music’s hottest acts 

cover Bleachers’ 

debut album

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Bleachers’ Terrible Thrills, Vol. 

2 is a reimagining of the band’s 
debut album consisting of the 
same 11 songs, 
written 
by 

frontman Jack 
Antonoff, per-
formed by an 
array of estab-
lished 
singers 

and 
up-and-

comers. I had 
the pleasure of 
seeing Bleach-
ers live this past 
summer: I concluded that though 
their record is OK, but their live 
performances are extraordinary. 
However, Vol. 2 offers a fresh 
perspective on their original LP, 
Strange Desire.

The 
album 
maintains 
the 

strength of its predecessor, with 
covers by Sara Bareilles, Char-
li XCX, Carly Rae Jepsen and 
Tinashe. Bareilles’s rendition of 
“Wild Heart” deviates from the 
original with its heavy produc-
tion, but it contrasts with the still-
smooth delivery, and the lyrics 
hold the track steady in a fashion 
that wasn’t present in the original. 
Conversely, Charli XCX’s growl-
ing delivery on “Rollercoaster” 
matches the instrumental tones 
point for point — it’s actually hard 
to believe the track isn’t solely 
hers. “Shadow” maintains its 
uplifting aura, and with its slight 
push towards bubblegum pop 
and Carly Rae Jepsen on vocals, 
the cover highlights Antonoff’s 
lyricism. The lead single from 
Strange Desire, “I Wanna Get 
Better,” can’t exactly get better; 
nonetheless, it can get different — 
which is precisely why the genre 
shift from Bleachers’ pop-rock to 
Tinashe’s smooth R&B doesn’t 
have listeners switching back to 

the original. And while her slight 
note changes offer the same range 
as Antonoff’s screams, it’s just not 
as much fun to sing along to.

The second act contains some of 

the most memorable moments on 
Strange Desire, and by way of the 
up-and-comers, the recreations 
only improve upon their predeces-
sors. “Wake Me” is the record’s 
biggest surprise. On the original, 
it’s a typical ‘lighter in the air’ 
track, but in the hands of Lucius, 
a five-piece indie-pop band, the 
track achieves the conversational 
tone it was always meant for. The 
band’s harmonization pushes the 
track in a direction that Antonoff 
can’t quite get to on his own. Con-
versely, Elle King could sing the 
dictionary and it would be a mel-
ody so beautiful, nothing seems 
to matter more than the music. 
“Reckless Love” is a slow burn: you 
sing along to it, but you don’t move 
to it. The softness of her delivery 
feels innocent, juxtaposed with 
the fiery crescendo making this 
love feel all the more reckless. For 
the album’s plateau, Brooke Candy 
and Rachel Antonoff team up for 
an unrecognizable cover of “Take 
Me Away.” The only consistency 
with the original is the ephemeral 
hook: “I know you’re sorry, I know 
you’re sorry, I know you’re sorry.” 
In the end, it’s a somewhat forget-
table cover of a somewhat forget-
table song.

And as for the third-act come-

back, the star-power is back. Sia 
takes on the melancholic “Like a 
River Runs.” Instead of resting 
on the chill-inducing a capella 
chorus, she creates a track that 
delivers the same degree of emo-
tion, but sounds completely dis-
similar. Sia’s take is a gospel while 
Antonoff’s is a rock show. MØ, 
best known for her feature with 
Major Lazer, breathes excitement 
back into the project with “You’re 
Still a Mystery.” Between a saxo-
phone solo, MØ’s tinge of auto-
tune and the song’s ’70s movie 
feel, the track stands out on Vol. 
2. Finally, Natalie Maines (of the 
Dixie Chicks) offers an acoustic, 
slightly country “Who I Want You 
to Love” to close the album. While 
the acoustic guitar and Maines’ 
echoed delivery pull listeners 
in one direction, the lengthy 
instrumental break paired with 
Antonoff’s outro remind them 
that this is still a Bleachers record.

From the outset, releasing an 

album of covers can be a tricky 
game. The covers can’t completely 
overwhelm the original work, but 
they also can’t underperform, or 
else there’s no point in producing 
them. This is exactly why Strange 
Desire works so well for this artis-
tic experiment. Vol. 2 highlights 
the strengths in Antonoff’s lyri-
cism by displaying them through 
a different lens — one that isn’t 
generally better or worse than the 
original — just different.

John Luther Adams 
talks life and oeuvre

By DAYTON HARE

For the Daily

The history of American con-

temporary classical music over 
that last half century has been 
as multi-
faceted as 
the 
face 

of Amer-
ica itself. 
Stud-
ded with 
styles and 
populated 
by various 
“isms,” 
American 
contem-
porary 
music is impossible to pin down 
and classify.

This variety in style is matched 

by the variety of composers, many 
of which have wildly different back-
grounds. 
Compos-
ers 
of 

today live 
lives 
as 

rock musi-
cians, jazz 
pianists, 
electronic 
perform-
ers 
and 

profes-
sionals 
that have nothing to do with music. 
Some composers are the children 
of concert masters; others never 
heard a Beethoven symphony until 
college. Each artist has taken their 
own unique road to becoming the 
composer they are.

One of the most interesting 

paths taken is perhaps the one 
tread by composer John Luther 
Adams — a path which has now led 
him to the University, where he’ll 
be giving a talk on Thursday at the 
Michigan Theater as part of the 
Penny Stamps Speaker Series.

Adams — who is not to be con-

fused with the equally famous but 
stylistically dissimilar California 
based composer John Adams — 
was born in Mississippi. As a child, 
his family moved from place to 
place a great deal.

“It was almost like being a mili-

tary brat, you know, we moved 
every few years, from the Deep 
South to the suburbs of New York 
City,” Adams said in an interview 
with the Michigan Daily.

His first musical experiences 

weren’t classical, but rather part 
of the world of rock ‘n’ roll, where 
he was the drummer for several 
bands during his adolescence — as 
part of the group, Pocket Fuzz, he 
once opened for the Beach Boys.

But Adams’s artistic direc-

tion was changed dramatically 
by an encounter with the music 
of Edgard Varèse (whose name 
the young Adams mispronounced 
Var-EE-zee) instigated by the lin-
ear notes of Frank Zappa’s album 
Freak Out!. Inspired by the avant-
garde Varèse, Adams listened to 
more and more contemporary 
classical music, and his and his 
band-mates work became more 
and more experimental.

A few years after being part of 

the first graduating class of the 
California Institute of the Arts, 
Adams made one of the most 
important decisions of his life — he 
moved to Alaska.

“As a result [of moving so fre-

quently as a child], there was never 
a place in which I felt I belonged, 
never really a place I thought I was 
at home,” Adams said.

In Alaska he worked as an 

environmental 
activist 
and 

lived for several decades, expe-
riences which strongly shaped 
his future work.

“I went north as an idealistic, 

romantic young man, running 
away from my family, running 
away from the suburbs and the cit-
ies, running away from academia, 
running away from competitive 
careerism — you know I thought 
I was leaving everything behind, 
that I was running away from the 
world,” Adams said.

“But it turns out that I was run-

ning to my home, my real family — 
the family I discovered and chose 
in Alaska — and my life’s work. 
And I can’t imagine what would 
have become of me as a man or as 
an artist had I not found Alaska. It 
is home in the deepest sense, and it 
always will be.”

From his experiences in Alaska, 

Adams drew inspiration for much 
of his compositions and ideas, 
some of which he will be discuss-
ing in the Penny Stamps talk.

“My theme is music in the 

Anthropocene,” Adams said of 
the Penny Stamps address. “It’s a 
reflection on the meaning of cre-
ative work, the meaning of art 
and music in these troubled times, 
when we live in a world on the 
verge of melting.”

Drawing from his 2003 essay 

“Global Warming and Art” and 
more recent writings, Adams said 
his talk is a “reflect[ion] on why I 
continue to do what I do in the face 
of potentially catastrophic envi-
ronmental change.”

Following the Penny Stamps 

address, the University Sympho-
ny Orchestra and conductor Ken-
neth Kiesler will be performing 
Adams’s work “Become Ocean” 
in Hill Auditorium, for which 
Adams was the recipient of the 
2014 Pulitzer Prize for Music.

“‘Become Ocean’ is my larg-

est orchestral work to date, and I 
think it’s the culmination of years 
of work. I think the music has 
been leading me to this piece for 
decades,” said Adams.

Adams 
wrote 
the 
piece 

very quickly, while in Mexico. 
Explaining its origins, he said 
“The house that we live in in 
Mexico is right on the water. If 
you have a good throwing arm 
you can stand on the deck and 
throw a ball into the ocean.”

“When we’re down there we 

sleep with the windows open, 
and I like to think that what 
happened was that the music of 
the sea was finding its way deep 
into my consciousness, into my 
dreams, and I would just get up 
in the morning and do my best to 
write down what I heard in my 
sleep,” said Adams.

Referencing the act of compos-

ing, Adams said “I don’t under-
stand how any of this works, and 
that’s fine with me.”

Adams elaborated, “As a cre-

ative artist, I often feel that if I 
think I know what I’m doing, then 
I’m probably not doing my job. I 
think it’s all about discovery and 
asking new questions, and not 
knowing exactly where you are or 
what you’re doing.”

 “The reason that music is wor-

thy of a lifetime of devotion is that 
the music always knows more 
than the composer. The music is 
always leading me into new ter-
ritory, and my job is simply to pay 
attention and to do my best to fol-
low it wherever it wants me to go.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

only be described as a “flop.” This 
was only two years after Miller’s 
graduation from the University. 

Miller 
began 
his 
time 
at 

Michigan as a journalism major 
and writer for The Michigan Daily, 
before switching his major to study 
English. Within the department, 
he began his artistry under the 
guidance of Kenneth Rowe. It was 
this relationship that continued to 
connect Miller to the University 
throughout his life. 

Through 
his 
studies 
of 

Greek classics and the works of 
Norwegian 
playwright 
Henrik 

Ibsen, Miller was drawn to themes 
of middle-class life and human 
weakness, which would inspire his 
work and the other most important 
plays of the 20th century. 

“He knew that if it wasn’t 

successful, he wouldn’t remain a 
dramatist. As he himself has put 
it, ‘there were far more important 
things to do in the world’ than write 
plays,” director Goldberg said. 

Goldberg, who also graduated 

from the University in 1995 as 
a 
Theater 
and 
Comparative 

Literature major, understands 
the deep relevance of the play 
today. She has high hopes for its 
audience. 

“This play will always have 

resonance because war is a big 
business and we, as a nation, seem 
to always be in that business. In 
addition, the central themes of 
honor and duty in a family will be 
issues families throughout history 
will grapple with,” Goldberg said. 
“My hope artistically is to expose 
the depth of this story and remind 
audiences of the timeless nature 
of this work.” 

Much of this timeless nature 

can be attributed to Miller’s ability 
to resonate with a broad audience. 

Goldberg uses the example of 
gender to discuss this, rejecting the 
idea that Miller writes “guy plays.” 
Her personal and most poignant 
connection to the play is with the 
wife and mother, Kaye Keller. 

“There is language about all 

that Kate has kept of her lost son 
Larry’s; she has preserved his 
room and his things, and our 
production exposes what is up 
in that bedroom we never see on 
stage. For me, it is to shed light on 
all the pain mothers in particular 
have to endure with this sort of 
loss,” Goldberg said. “Kate Keller 
is given the last lines of this play — 
like a great Shakespeare play, the 
final speaker is assumed to be the 
one who will be the successor, and 
indeed in this domestic world, it 
remains true.” 

The 
excitement 
and 

commitment of those behind the 
production merits attention as 
well. Goldberg and the cast of 10 
students (some acting parts many 
years their senior) will bring to 
life these nuanced perspectives, 
freshening 
the 
play 
and 

maximizing its emotional power. 

“My other large job in this 

production is to modulate the 
emotional intensity and help the 
actors choreograph their internal 
and external life,” Goldberg said. 
Each character is critical in their 
own way, and the team has spent a 
great deal of time developing each 
individual story. 

“To direct Miller in the only 

theater in the world named after 
Miller, at a place that has shared 
this meaning for both of us, is 
a gift I will always cherish,” 
Goldberg said. 

As a treasure of American 

artistry 
and 
an 
accessible 

exploration 
of 
social 

responsibility, war and loss, “All 
My Sons” fulfills its important 
artistic 
function, 
transcends 

generational gaps and earns its 
handle as “timeless.”

De Jong part of crowded ‘D’ core; 
Larkin makes impressive debut

Berenson mum on 
starter at goalie 
ahead of Friday’s 

season opener

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan hockey coach Red 

Berenson has a new problem: 
he 
has 
too 
many 
qualified 

defensemen.

Compared 
to 
last 
season, 

when Berenson had to lean 
heavily on his 
top 
pairings, 

this 
season 

there aren’t enough spots for 
each defenseman to dress every 
night.

“We’re still going to have 

a tough decision every game 
putting our lineup together on 
defense,” Berenson said. “We’ve 
got eight defensemen who can 
play, and we’re not going to dress 
eight — we’re either going to 
dress six or seven.”

Part of the crowded defense 

stems from the addition of two 
highly touted freshmen: Joesph 
Cecconi and Nicholas Boka. Both 
played well in the Wolverines’ 
exhibition game against the 
University of Toronto, and look 
capable of logging considerable 
minutes.

And with juniors Michael 

Downing and Cutler Martin 
— as well as sophomore Zach 
Werenski — already locks to play 
every night, there are just one or 
two spots left on defense.

Look for junior Kevin Lohan, 

junior 
Nolan 
De 
Jong 
and 

sophomore Sam Piazza to vie for 
that spot or spots.

De Jong has been particularly 

noticeable thus far. He notched 
the first goal of his career against 
Toronto, played the point on the 
power play and made good zone 
reads.

“He’s a junior now and a 

leader on the D-core,” Werenski 
said. “We don’t have any junior 

defensemen, so the juniors will 
have to step up. And he’s got to 
step up. Even though it was an 
exhibition, he scored and got that 
monkey off his back. I know he 
hasn’t scored here yet.”

Berenson, however, said De 

Jong still hasn’t reached his 
full potential. But Berenson 
is starting to notice glimpses 
of De Jong’s 
ability that he 
saw when he 
recruited him.

De 
Jong 

credits that to 
his 
strenous 

lifting 
and 

conditioning 
routine 
this 

summer for his 
improvement, 
which has also made him “more 
comfortable on the ice.”

If De Jong becomes the player 

Berenson believes he can be, 
he could be a top puck-moving 
defenseman who can run the 
point on the offensive attack.

And while he might not be 

there yet, he’s well on his way, 
giving 
Berenson 
a 
tougher 

decision every night.

GOALTENDING 

CONUNDRUM: The goaltending 
situation still remains an enigma.

In the exhibition game against 

Toronto, Berenson opted to start 
junior Zach Nagelvoort in the 
first period, senior Steve Racine 
in the second and freshman 
Chad Catt in the third.

“We’re 

just starting,” 
Berenson said. 
“This 
has 

been 
really 

good, and the 
coaches 
have 

only been on 
the ice for a 
week. 
We’re 

just getting a 
feel now with 

(goaltending coach Steve) Shields 
on the ice everyday. So we’ll see 
who plays Friday.”

LARKIN’S NHL SPLASH: 

Last year’s Big Ten Freshman 
of the Year is already forming 
an impressive résumé for NHL 
Rookie of the Year.

Dylan 
Larkin, 
who 
left 

Michigan after one season, made 

the Detroit Red Wings’ opening-
night roster and has wasted 
no time making a splash. The 
former Wolverine notched a goal 
and an assist in his first game.

He became the first Red 

Wings player to score in his NHL 
debut against the Toronto Maple 
leads since Gordie Howe — 69 
years ago.

“I was surprised, but I wasn’t,” 

Werenski said. “It’s pretty cool 
for him to score his first goal at 
(Joe Louis Arena). I was on the 
glass actually, and he looked over 
at me a few times.”

Added Berenson: “It was a 

perfect storm for Dylan, playing 
in Detroit, playing on the first 
line, scoring a goal, and then 
they won.”

Larkin has a goal and three 

assists through two games.

BRIEFLY: Junior defenseman 

Michael Downing is now all-
systems-go after injuring his 
hand just under two weeks ago.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Junior defender Nolan De Jong has edged his way into the conversation on Michigan’s deep blue line.

“We’re still 

going to have a 
tough decision 
every game.”

‘M’ dominates Duquesne

By TYLER SCOTT

Daily Sports Writer

The attacking end of the 

Michigan men’s soccer team 
has been far more productive 
than in 2014, and that showed in 
Tuesday’s 
match 
against 
Duquesne.

The Wolverines defeated the 

Dukes, 3-0, after scoring all of 
their goals within the first 46 
minutes of the game and bearing 
down 
defensively 
to 
limit 

Duquesne’s 
own 
second-half 

chances.

Michigan’s recent offensive 

success hasn’t been lost on senior 
forward Colin McAtee, who 
contributed two scores.

“We’re feeling pretty good 

about our offense this year,” 
McAtee 
said. 
“Especially 

compared to last year, where I 
don’t know if we even scored 
much more than we have now.”

Michigan is averaging 1.83 goals 

per game this season, compared to 
1.11 for all of last year.

Despite being tied for first 

in the Big Ten, the win over 
Duquesne was the first for the 
Wolverines (5-3-3) in the month 
of October. Michigan opened up 
the month with tie games against 
Wisconsin and No. 7 Notre Dame, 
and most recently suffered an 
overtime loss to Rutgers.

“It’s not like we’ve been 

playing poorly or we have to 
change anything drastically,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 

Daley. “A lot of teams come to 
Michigan and give us their best 
game. So we have to ultimately 
be prepared for that, and have 
to ride the highs with the lows. 
I think our guys did a good job 
responding tonight.”

The 
Wolverines 
have 

been without senior captain 
James Murphy due to injury 
for a month, and freshmen 

defenseman Marcello Borges is 
currently playing in an under-20 
league in Germany. Even with 
a 
somewhat-depleted 
roster, 

Michigan 
stopped 
Duquesne 

from 
ever 
getting 
into 
the 

contest.

The 
Dukes 
took 
just 

seven shots compared to the 
Wolverines’ 15, and sophomore 
goalkeeper Evan Louro only had 
to make one save to be perfect on 
the night.

Daley 
has 
stamped 
into 

his team the belief that good 
defense at all positions will 
give Michigan chances to win. 
Indeed, the first goal of the 
night came in the 27th minutes 
as McAtee contested Duquesne 
goalkeeper Sam Frymier as a 
high-deflected ball came down 
inside the 12-yard box.

As the ball fell toward the 

pitch, 
both 
players 
slipped. 

Frymier fell forward, leaving 
McAtee with the ball and a 
wide open net. He was able to 
scramble to his feet and launch a 

scoring shot before the defenders 
closed in to give Michigan a lead 
to build on.

“It was great to look up to see 

the ball in front of me and the 
goal wide open,” McAtee said. 
“It’s not the prettiest goal, but I’ll 
take that any day. That’s probably 
the easiest goal I’ve had.”

Just 10 minutes later, the 

Wolverines doubled their score 
in a more standard fashion. 
Freshman 
forward 
Francis 

Atuahene was able to speed past 
his defender to receive a through 
ball from sophomore midfielder 
Tyler Anderson on the backside 
of the play and net a wide open 
shot just below the crossbar 
center goal.

In the first half, the Dukes 

repeatedly 
tried 
to 
draw 

Michigan on the attack and 
send the ball deep in order 
to 
create 
offensive 
chances. 

They managed to get off five 
shots in the first half, some of 
which soared barely outside the 
crossbars, but much of the game 

was spent with the Wolverines 
controlling the ball on offense.

Ten seconds into the second 

half, chances of a Duquesne 
comeback were further dashed 
by McAtee. On the echo of the 
whistle, the Wolverine front line 
of McAtee, redshirt sophomore 
midfielder 
Michael 
Kapitula 

and freshman midfielder Robbie 
Mertz started sprinting toward 
the goal line.

Three successful passes later, 

McAtee was lined up for an open 
shot inside the 18-yard box on 
the left for his second goal of the 
night.

Staring in the face of a 

3-0 deficit, Duquesne rarely 
threatened again. It did get its 
only shot on goal, which Louro 
saved, one of only two shots by 
the Dukes in the second half.

“We 
were 
definitely 
very 

motivated (after the loss to 
Rutgers),” McAtee said. “And to 
score early, I think that really 
helped boost our confidence and 
control the rest of the game.”

Atuahene leads 
Michigan in win

By KATIE CONKLIN

Daily Sports Writer

Francis 
Atuahene’s 
shot 

powered off his laces and slid 
just beneath the crossbar. It 
was the Michigan men’s soccer 
team’s second goal Tuesday 
night, boosting the Wolverines 
to a 3-0 victory over Duquesne, 
and Atuahene’s ninth goal of his 
rookie season.

The freshman forward has 

been a force on Michigan’s 
roster ever since he stepped 
foot on Wolverine turf. In his 
debut match against then-No. 6 
Creighton, Atauhene took two 
shots, one on net. He has upheld 
this tenacity and become one of 
Michigan’s top scoring threats.

“He’s been one of the most 

dominant players on the team 
and one of the most dangerous 
in the country,” said redshirt 
senior midfielder Colin McAtee.

McAtee, who finished with 

two bookend goals, worked 
closely with Atuahene all game, 
leading to the victory against 
the Dukes.

As the second freshman in 

Michigan men’s soccer history 
to score a hat trick, Atuahene 
has scored just over 40 percent 
of the team’s goals, contributing 
immensely to the Wolverines’ 
successful season thus far.

In the 2014 season, Michigan 

scored a grand total of 20 goals. 
Just halfway through the 2015 
season, the Wolverines (6-3-
3) have already exceeded that 
with 22. Much of this can be 
attributed not only to the team’s 
attack, but to the freshman 
class itself.

The freshmen have tallied 

half of Michigan’s goals this 
season. While many may be 

extremely impressed by such a 
statistic, Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley expected such influence 
early in their careers.

“We 
went 
through 
a 

transitional period here with 
Michigan soccer, and we didn’t 
bring them in to be freshmen,” 
Daley said. “We brought them 
in to play, and they’ve shown 
that they can come in and play.”

Daley also praised freshman 

midfielder Ivo Cerda, who’s 
had a lot of game time for a 
young player, and expects to 
see a lot from him for years 
to come. Rounding out the 
group on defense are freshmen 
Marcello Borges and Peter 
Brown, who are becoming 
more comfortable within the 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 
unit. 

Daley foresees expert play 
coming from them in the 
future, as well.

Such game-changing play, 

though, continues to come from 
Atuahene. Scoring in six of 
the last seven matches, Daley 
speaks highly of Atuahene but 
still looks for improvement in 
his consistency. Consistency, 
Daley believes, should come 
naturally 
as 
the 
season 

progresses through experience, 
comfort and hard work, the 
latter of which is something 
Atuahene is used to.

“He always has a smile on 

his face,” Daley said. “He works 
his butt off in class, he works 
his butt off in training, and the 
results are being shown on the 
field.”

And if Atuahene continues 

to prepare, these results should 
only improve over the next 
three years.

He’s only a freshman, after 

all.

Tuesdays with Jourdan: 
Junior CB brings energy

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Between his leadership and his 

defense, Jourdan Lewis brings a 
lot to the Michigan football team. 
The junior cornerback leads the 
team in pass breakups and is one 
of the most senior members of 
the secondary, and he returned 
an interception for a touchdown 
against 
Northwestern 
on 

Saturday.

But one underrated boost 

Lewis brings to the Wolverines 
doesn’t 
come 
on 
Saturdays. 

Every Tuesday, all season long, 
the normally laid-back Lewis 
has shown up to practice with 
his most energy of the week.

“That’s his day,” said junior 

safety Delano Hill. “He says, 
‘Tuesday is my day, I’m gonna 
help y’all out with the energy, 
and the rest of the week y’all 
gotta help me.’ Today was his 
day, so the rest of the week, we’re 
gonna help him out.”

Normally, Tuesdays can be 

lower-energy. It doesn’t have the 
excitement of being the first day 
of the week, but it’s still far from 
game day. It can be grueling. But 
when you bring up his Tuesday 
energy routine, Lewis shows no 
signs of dread or intimidation. 
He shows excitement.

“Tuesday’s the start of the 

week — the work week,” Lewis 
said. “When we start working, 
we’ve got full pads on, that’s 
when we really get down and 
grind.”

With Lewis, that’s exactly 

the point. If he can get the team 
fired up on Tuesday, when the 
hard work starts, they can ride 
the energy through the harder 
practices of the week.

As for his tactics, teammates 

never quite know which method 
Lewis will take to bring the hype.

“He just acts wild,” Hill said. 

“Screaming, whatever you can 
name, he’s doing it.”

Normally, Lewis has a relaxed 

demeanor. He is relatively small 
in stature, and he speaks softly, 
albeit with an edge. That, too, 

plays a role in Lewis’ Tuesday 
tradition.

Since his teammates know 

him as laid-back, seeing him full 
of energy re-ignites the defense.

Regardless of how reserved 

Lewis can be off the field, his 
performances in games have 
spoken volumes. Pro Football 
Focus rated him as the nation’s 
best 
cornerback 
before 
the 

Northwestern game, and after 
he returned an interception for 
a touchdown, redshirt freshman 
safety Jabrill Peppers echoed 
that sentiment.

Through six games, he has 

broken up eight passes and has 
two interceptions, and those 
numbers 
come 
despite 
the 

fact that teams have avoided 
throwing his way all year long.

“He’s 
earned 
everything 

that’s been said about him and 
even more,” said redshirt junior 

receiver Jehu Chesson. “I think 
he’s one of the best cornerbacks 
I’ve ever gone against. To be 
going against him every day, it’s 
a great opportunity for me to get 
better, because if I fail at a route 
or something, I can go to him and 
sort of see what he saw.”

Like most receivers Lewis 

faces, Chesson is significantly 
taller than the 5-foot-10 Lewis. 
To combat it, the junior relies 
mostly on his speed, game 
planning and yes, his energy, to 
exploit opponents’ weaknesses.

“There’s really nothing to this 

game but preparation,” Chesson 
said. “If you really want to win, 
you’ll prepare, and he really 
wants to win every play, so he’ll 
prepare and do so every play.”

Some days, preparation means 

being calculated and reserved. 
But on Tuesdays, it could mean 
just about anything.

‘M’ impressive in 
California outing

Mueller’s 198 

breaks Michigan 

tournament record, 
earns fourth place

By CONNOR MULSHINE

For the Daily

On his way to a record 

performance, sophomore Kyle 
Mueller led the Michigan men’s 
golf team to a fifth-place finish 
at the MacKenzie Invitational in 
Fairfax, California.

After limping to a 13th-place 

finish at the event in 2014, the 
Wolverines 
saw 
significant 

improvement this year in an 
event 
that 

broke several 
program 
records. 
Mueller broke 
the Michigan 
tournament 
record by four 
strokes with a 
198 on his way 
to 
finishing 

fourth overall. 
Joining 
him 

in the top 10 was senior Chris 
O’Neill, who played a bogey-
free final round to finish with a 
personal-best 204.

As a team, the Wolverines 

shot a program-record 824, 
shattering the previous mark by 
15 shots.

“I’d say it was a good event,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Chris 

Whitten. “I’m never going to 
say that I’m real happy about 
finishing fifth, but we definitely 
saw some good things from our 
guys, and we can take some 
confidence from the way we 
scored.”

After starting the final day 11 

strokes behind California, the 
tournament winner, Michigan 

struggled to gain its footing on 
the front nine before finishing 
the day strong with a 275. The 
Wolverines did most of their 
damage on the par-5s, scoring 
28 under par while only posting 
one 
bogey 
throughout 
the 

tournament.

“The ball striking this week 

was very good,” Whitten said. 
“Probably the best I’ve seen 
from most of our guys this fall, 
which is really encouraging.” 

Mueller tied a program record 

with a 64 in the second round to 
cap his third straight top-five 
tournament finish, largely due 
to his ability to avoid bogeys. 
After three bogeys crippled an 
otherwise-stellar first round, 
Michigan’s 
top 
finisher 
did 

not bogey a 
hole for the 
remainder 
of 
the 

tournament. 
Mueller ended 
with a 69-64-
65, falling two 
strokes short 
of 
winner 

Cody 
Blick 

from San Jose 
State.

Despite a solid finish in 

the team standings, Whitten 
believes there is room for 
improvement from this week’s 
record-setting 
performance. 

Michigan 
finished 
just 
five 

strokes shy of second place 
and is looking to cut down on 
mistakes moving forward to the 
Royal Oaks Intercollegiate in 
Dallas on Oct. 26.

“We were giving shots back 

with some bogeys and you really 
can’t afford to do that,” Whitten 
said. “We have to continue to 
work on our strategy a little bit 
and continuing to analyze the 
situation we’re in and choosing 
the correct shot to execute it as 
good as we can.”

MEN’S GOLF

“We can take 

some confidence 

from the way 
we scored.”

Field position, return game 
taking leaps under Baxter

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

It was an absolute clinic on 

how to run a kickoff return.

Northwestern 
kicker 
Matt 

Micucci avoided highly touted 
return 
man 
and 
redshirt 

freshman safety Jabrill Peppers. 
Instead, he kicked to the east 
side of the field as his gunners 
to seal off the secondary return 
man and redshirt junior wide 
receiver Jehu Chesson.

Instead, 
Chesson 
— 

whom 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh would later say is the 
12th-ranked Wolverines’ fastest 
player — broke past the seal and 
went all 96 yards untouched to 
give Michigan its first opening-
kickoff touchdown return since 
1992.

It shocked the Wildcats, the 

fans in the stadium and just 
about everyone watching on TV 
at home, but one man on the 
sideline saw it coming the entire 
time.

Michigan 
special 
teams 

coordinator 
John 
Baxter 
is 

known as something of a guru in 
the world of special teams, and 
just six games into his tenure at 
Michigan, the Wolverines are 
already reaping the benefits of 
his presence.

“He thinks on another level,” 

Chesson said of Baxter. “One 
of his things is that every team 
presents a puzzle to solve, and 
he’s going to work harder than 
the next guy and work harder 
than any other coach, and I 
think he does that.

“I’m very confident to say that 

we have one of the best special 
teams coordinators there is.”

So far, Baxter has been able 

to solve that puzzle every week. 
According to FootballOutsiders.
com, the Wolverines were 82nd 
in the nation in field position 
advantage in 2014, a statistic 

that measures the net gain or 
loss from field position. This 
year, Michigan is ninth.

According 
to 
ESPN, 
the 

Wolverines are fourth nationally 
in 
special 
teams 
efficiency 

after finishing 2014 96th in the 
category.

Due 
to 

Michigan’s 
stifling 
defense an an 
opponents’ 
tendency 
to 

settle 
for 
a 

touchback, 
it 

has only had 
five 
kickoff 

returns — two 
fewer 
than 

any 
other 

team in the country — but leads 
the nation with a 39.0 return 
average.

“When you’re back there and 

you’re trained so well like we 
are, things go in slow motion,” 
Chesson said. “You just kind of 
see gaps and holes open up. On 

that play, the blocks made their 
blocks, and the ball carrier made 
a good decision with the ball.”

Yes, 
Chesson 
referred 
to 

himself as a ball carrier. Under 
Baxter, plays are taught to see 
the plays as puzzles to solve, 
and their roles as simple cogs in 

the 
machine, 

not 
personal 

efforts.

“That’s the 

key (to special 
teams),” 
Chesson said. 
“You have to 
be 
selfless. 

You have to do 
things 
other 

guys may not 
want 
to 
do, 

and the players who do that are 
the ones who are going to play.”

Among 
those 
players 
is 

Peppers. Rated as one of the most 
explosive players in the country 
before he even took a snap for 
Michigan, Peppers was more 
than happy to let Chesson get 

the touchdown, sprinting ahead 
to block the only Northwestern 
player that came within 10 yards 
of Chesson.

“Big 
mistake 
(kicking 
to 

Chesson),” Peppers said with a 
grin. “I saw the way they lined 
the tee up and told Jehu, ‘The 
ball’s coming to you. I got your 
block.’

“The whole special teams unit 

wants to see those touchdowns 
and knows they have to do their 
jobs to make it happen.”

Baxter solved Northwestern’s 

puzzle, and has moved on to 
Michigan State. The Spartans 
have shown discipline on special 
teams in their latest rise to 
national prominence, but under 
Baxter, so will the Wolverines.

“I don’t really know what 

other teams do in terms of 
special teams, but I think there 
are things that (Baxter) does 
that are unique on a play-by-play 
basis,” Chesson said. “He really 
takes his time and coaches each 
individual position.”

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Redshirt junior Jehu Chesson returned a kick for touchdown Saturday, a reward for Michigan’s improving special teams unit.

“You have to 

do things other 
guys may not 
want to do.”

“

Jeremiah was a bullfrog! 
Was a good friend of mine!” 
– a genius.

Can I call this a humor col-

umn yet? Whenever someone 
asks me about it (this has hap-
pened twice), I want to say, “I 
write humor, nyah!” but I’m 
afraid they’ll stab me in the eye 
with a copy of the New Yorker. 
Or vomit. Ah well. Living is 
the worst part about life. Also, 
genocide, rape and death. Also, 
socks with holes in ‘em.

So I like comedy. I laugh at 

my own jokes: What did the 
entomologist’s 
mother 
say 

when her son’s Drosophila 
melanogaster was depressed? 
“Your fly is down.” Hilarious. 
Important. Italics.

I did stand-up comedy for 

the first time last Saturday. 
Here’s the story. It’s a tear-
jerker so get your Kleenex™ 
(“Kleenex: Ah. Now that’s good 
wipin’.”).

Sunday (one week before the 

show)

I lay face down on my floor 

and thought about failing and 
depression 
and 
loneliness. 

Then I wondered who played 
the Inspector in Young Fran-
kenstein ... Kenneth Mars! I 
thought about failing again.

In a fit of sweaty determina-

tion, I resolved to write some-
thing every day, revolutionize 
comedy, subvert the medium, 
invent a medium, look up the 
definition of “medium,” call my 
Mommy. And stuff!

Monday
I did nothing.
Tuesday
Finally, I wrote:
“Hey! If phenomena is the 

plural of phenomenon, is cin-
ema the plural of cinnamon?” I 
got heckled by my Waluigi doll. 
I sighed, tried to cry and put my 
pants back on.

I’ve always wanted to do 

comedy — if you don’t count 
the 19 years I wanted to be a 
baseball player, photographer, 
journalist, politician, therapist, 

psychiatrist, actor, judge, pros-
ecutor, priest or happy.

I stopped writing at 2:00 

a.m., stared into the mirror for 
two hours, went to bed at 4:00.

Wednesday
I woke at 8:00, sleep-

deprived, nauseous, like float-
ing in a block of lead. (Honestly, 
does anyone even edit this shit?)

I stood on my (cool, red) 

couch, held my microphone 
(the TV remote) to my lips and 
practiced my opening:

“Wow. Hey guys. Wow.”
I didn’t sleep that night.
Thursday
I did things, did things, did 

things.

I ate a bagel, wondered what 

a push-up would feel like and 
ate another bagel.

I walked home at 2:00 a.m., 

hands 
stuffed 
in 
pockets, 

breath materializing in front of 
me, floating off into dead noth-
ingness just like Grandpa!

Sorry. Life is a snowball 

effect. Socks with holes in ‘em.

“What’s funny?” I asked 

God. “What’s the formula for 
funny? Also: The hell, Man?”

On the way home, a big, 

drunk fella pointed at me and 
yelled something. I removed my 
headphones.

Me: “What?”
He: “I masturbate to you at 

night!” 

I think about him a lot.
Friday
You’re 
bombing 
tomor-

row, monkey! You’re bombing 
tomorrow! (And you have a doc-
tor’s appointment on Tuesday. 
Don’t forget.)

I felt like vomiting. Or run-

ning. But then, not running 
because running sucks.

At 2:30 a.m., I smoked weed 

for the first time.

(Sorry, Mom, Dad, and dead 

grandparents. Editor says I can’t 
devote whole, big paragraph to 
explanation of life choices, so 
I’ll just say this: How’s the dog?)

That night, in bed, I didn’t 

think about my set. (Or you ... 

Sharon.)

Saturday (Show Night)
The night was cold and wet, 

like refrigerated ham or a dead 
body in an aboveground pool 
or my hands, always. I paced up 
and down the street, muttering 
my set and little affirmations:

“You’re taller than most. 

You’re taller than most. You 
have neat hair. Your sense of 
humor totally distracts from 
your psychological problems, 
handsome.”

At 9:20 p.m., in a Kerrytown 

backyard, I took the stage. Tree 
branches hung over the stands, 
tickling the microphones, wish-
ing me, “OK luck.” Trees can be 
such dicks sometimes.

My heart beat hard, fast, to a 

rhythm. It felt like, “Jeremiah 
was a bullfrog!”

One hundred and fifty people 

stared at me. They were all cold, 
all standing, all better than me 
in their own oh-so-special 
ways.

“Was a good friend of mine!”
“Hey guys,” I said, peeing a 

little.

I felt their eyes, their blinks, 

the spots in their brains that 
light up when something’s 
funny. A little voice in my head 
shouted something racist, but 
I couldn’t hear it over the deaf-
ening nothing. I had to turn 
my head to see everyone. They 
didn’t have to turn their heads 
to see me.

I held in a fart.
You are a bullfrog, Alex ... No. 

You are The bullfrog.

I said the most honest thing I 

could think of:

“I’m a 21 year-old, white, tall, 

straight, Catholic college guy. 
And I tell it like it is ... That’s 
right. I’m everyone’s favorite 
kind of person.”

A moment. A blank, ines-

capable moment. Then. Then. 
Then. Those 150 somebodies 
laughed. And I – I went on. Into 
that irreversible, unachievable 
It.

And It was good.

Another Thing: I need you to laugh

My Cultural Currency: Weddings

I 

want a wedding.

Let me be clear, I 

don’t want a loving union 

built out of mutual respect and 
support, to paraphrase writer 
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

I’m still a teenager who can’t 

even match her socks, doesn’t 
start her homework until it’s 
already too late and can only 
quote an author because of 
memorizing a Beyoncé song; I 
hardly think I’d be prepared, 
much less do I want, to be in a 
marriage.

What I really want is the 

fanfare of a big, fat Indian 
wedding. The groom can be a 
stand-in male model, a cardboard 
cutout of Elvis Presley or we can 
just get rid of him completely. 
Honestly, I don’t particularly 
care about that part. What I care 
about is the clothes, the food and 
the idea of being the center of 
attention. 

I want a wedding so badly, I 

once searched on Google, “Can 
I marry myself?” before quickly 
deleting 
my 
search 
history, 

restarting my computer and going 
to bed. In my (weak) defense, it 
was 4 a.m. and I was running on 
what I think was my fifth cup of 
coffee, which had started making 
me feel some type of way.

Like in all weddings from all 

cultures, when it comes to Indian 
weddings no one gives a shit 
about the groom. That suits me 
perfectly fine, because I am truly 
very content to be the center of 
attention for a straight month.

Here’s 
where, 
if 
you’re 

not 
Indian, 
you’re 
probably 

scratching your head. A wedding 
doesn’t last for a straight month, 
right? They’re a few hours or, 
if the couple is ridiculously 
extravagant, an entire day.

I don’t think I’m making a 

strong enough case for why I 
would want a wedding so badly 
and 
I 
blame 
TLC. 
They’re 

notorious 
for 
making 
entire 

television shows centered on 
the 
hullabaloo 
surrounding 

Christian weddings.

Hindu Indian weddings are 

a multi-day event composed of 
several parts: first, you’ve got the 
engagement, then approximately 
15 
poojas, 
a 
mehndi/haldi 

ceremony, 
a 
sangeet, 
the 

actual wedding and finally, the 
reception.

One of the greatest tragedies 

of my life is that I can’t dance 
for crap. But that’s OK, really. 
Everyone can just dance around 
me, like the jesters and clowns 
that 
existed 
in 
mid-century 

courts.

Every one of these events is not 

only essential, but must also be 
completely “decked out.” And by 
decked out, I mean that in every 
possible interpretation of the 

phrase.

Wedding on a fairy light and 

carnation-covered yacht in the 
middle of Lake Michigan. All 
eyes will be on the bride, who will 
wear a custom-designed Manish 
Malhotra bridal sari in firetruck 
red. 
Celebrity 
Chef 
Sanjeev 

Kapoor catered the food, which 
the bride took several helpings of.

The groom was nowhere in 

sight.

If you’ve made it through 

the entire column, then you’ve 
probably concluded that I sound 
like a vapid, materialistic and 
awful person.

And, well, to that I say: “Fair 

enough.”

HOUSING HEADACHE: 

Renting off-campus at the ‘U’

by Emma Kerr, Senior News Editor

F

inding housing: the exciting, sometimes heartbreaking, 
endeavor all University students partake in some form or 
another during their time in Ann Arbor. 

With only guaranteed housing for freshman at the Univer-

sity, many upperclassmen often engage in a adventurous search 
for other housing options at the beginning of their sophomore 
year. This presents a challenge that many students may not be 
able to handle — especially in the first few weeks of a fall semes-
ter.

To find housing that is both close to campus and affordable 

may seem impossible for some. And the increasingly competi-
tive nature of Ann Arbor housing means students are often 
forced to sign leases earlier in the season each year.

The process is a major source of concern according to a sur-

vey of about 100 students who live off-campus conducted by 
The Michigan Daily.

Business junior Sarah Mironov said her experience search-

ing for off-campus housing, after living in her sorority house 
sophomore year, was high pressure and stressful. It also began 
immediately after returning to campus in the fall, while she was 
still adjusting to campus life.

“I feel like Michigan is a unique school in that, a) students 

don’t live in dorms beyond their freshman year and b) the hous-
ing process starts incredibly early,” Mironov said. “Whereas my 
friends at other schools start thinking about the housing pro-
cess toward the winter, even into the spring, for us we had to 
start looking for housing during our first few weeks on campus.”

Yet the process doesn’t seem out of the ordinary to Mironov, 

who signed a lease on Sept. 19.

“(The process) seemed pretty average for my whole group 

of friends,” Mironov said. “I have some friends who didn’t sign 
until October but I also know people who signed leases during 
Welcome Week.”

Many students form groups and commit to properties under 

similar circumstances. According to the survey, 41 percent of 
off-campus students sign a lease 10 to 12 months in advance of 
move-in.

When unable to sign a lease, some will resort to signing a res-

ervation, which ensures them first rights to sign the property if 
the occupants at the time do not renew a lease. The reservation 
and renewal system means many properties never appear on 
the University’s listing site or even the sites of property man-
agement companies.

The City of Ann Arbor requires property management com-

panies and landlords to wait 70 days after the start of the cur-
rent tenant’s rental period before showing the property or 
signing a lease with a new party. If the average rental period is 
around Sept. 1, that means it’s not until November that student 
should be even able to start looking at properties.

However, by not having formal tours of a given property, but 

rather unscheduled tours at the will of current tenants, and hav-
ing signed intent to lease forms — or rather by ignoring the city 
ordinance entirely — landlords and students, alike, avoid wait-
ing until mid November to firm up housing plans for the follow-
ing year.

Jon Keller manages hundreds of houses for rent in Ann Arbor. 

He’s also a University alum, and with that perspective, Keller 
said, his company has developed a particular understanding of 
what it means to be a landlord for tenants who are primarily stu-
dents — though he’s seen many landlords do it the wrong way.

“We’ve worked with every landlord there is in town and we 

know who keeps their word and who doesn’t,” Keller said in an 
interview with the Daily. “I just feel bad for the kids who get 
bad landlords.”

Companies who disregard the ordinance that requires wait-

ing until 70 days after the current tenancy start date to sign a 
lease with new prospective tenants are fined by the City of Ann 
Arbor. Because of the competitive nature of students’ search for 
off-campus housing, however, many companies pay the fine and 
continue to lease to students in the early fall months.

“A lot of landlords are just flat out disregarding this rule 

because the fine is a thousand bucks and there’s never been 
anyone fined that I know of. The fine is so proportionally small 
compared to a $60,000 lease listing, that it’s really a cost of 
doing business for some of these bigger companies.”

Keller added that though he does accept reservations, he 

does not show or sign leases until after the 70 day period.

“Yes, people are signing left and right — just not with us,” 

Keller said.

Last week, an unofficial off-campus housing fair was set up 

on the second floor of the Michigan Union, and in attendance 
were housing management companies, like Cappo Manage-
ment and Campus Realty, as well as the larger student-targeted 
apartment buildings, like Landmark Apartments. About twenty 
students circulated the room, others filtering in and out.

The University’s Beyond the Diag program, an effort to pro-

mote the University’s engagement with off-campus students 
organized by the Dean of Students’ office, sponsors yet another 
fair on Nov. 4.

In an e-mail, Molly Labrousse, Beyond the Diag program 

manager, described the University’s various resources, which 
included a listing site, descriptions of each Ann Arbor neigh-
borhood, and the availability of staff members in the Dean of 
Students office to help with any questions students may have.

In addition to both North and Central campus housing fairs, 

the University offers an Off-Campus Housing website that 
includes rental listings, but at the time this article went to print, 
a search for a two or three bedroom apartment in the East Pack-
ard area yielded a meager five results. And some of the results 
that appear are for leases that begin in May rather than the 
standard September start date.

However, Engineering sophomore Brent Patterson said there 

is still a lack of information regarding off-campus housing 
options and companies as well as a variety of unhelpful Univer-
sity resources.

“I didn’t really like that — it was showing properties that 

weren’t really relevant, out by Pinckney,” Patterson said.

He said he relies more on sites like Cribspot and Yelp to know 

what houses were available and to get a sense for the reputation 
of the company, building, or landlord.

****

The Daily’s survey suggests that many students are generally 

happy with their housing once they find a property.

On average, students rated their experience with their cur-

rent landlord a 6.7 on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 signifying 
complete satisfaction. Forty-one percent of respondents cited 
unsatisfactory quality of the house or apartment as the primary 
issue they had encountered during their time living off campus.

Other prominent issues students indicated in the survey 

included unresponsiveness from their landlords, and unclear 
or confusing lease agreements between tenants and landlords. 
However, 33 percent of students said overall they had no com-
plaints overall about their landlord or property management 
company.

For those that still don’t want to tackle the process, other 

options are still available, such as Greek life organizations and 
properties offered through Inter-Cooperative Council hous-
ing — also known as co-ops. There are seventeen co-ops in 
Ann Arbor, sixteen of which are on Central Campus and one 
of which is on North Campus. There are 65 different registered 
sororities and fraternities on campus as of Oct. 6.

In the Greek system, housing policies and lease durations can 

vary from house to house. Many of these organizations rely on 
involvement and seniority rankings to determine room assign-
ments, and students pay rent via the organization.

Co-ops offer students flexibility in regard to the timing of 

their housing decisions, as well as the length of lease, while also 
providing for more affordable, hassle-free off-campus hous-
ing, according to Linder president Courtney Smeenge, an LSA 
senior.

“Every house has a different field, but the guiding principle 

among the coops is that it’s affordable housing for students 
and no landlords involved,” Smeenge said. “It’s cool that way 
because it’s an autonomous organization where house members 
have control.”

Co-ops function on a first come-first serve basis, but they 

offer single semester contracts as opposed to 12-month con-
tracts. Smeenge added there are often openings during the 
semester and a wide selection of houses that may have open-

ings. They also have a waitlist system if students are hoping for 
a particular house.

Rent typically includes utilities, food, and, of course, a room. 

There are no unexplained fees and the house is managed by the 
Inter Cooperative Council rather than a traditional landlord.

“You just have all of these different costs coming together 

and then you’re buying food on top of that, so it’s nice here 
because our rent is everything — it’s all in one package,” she 
said.

Co-ops and Greek life housing present alternatives to the 

self-driven, independent search for off-campus housing that 
many, if not most students, will undergo at some point during 
their time at the University.

There is a huge variety and selection when it comes to prop-

erty management companies in Ann Arbor — landlords range 
from large companies owning or managing 50 houses to an 
individual landlord who owns one, maybe two properties. 

In the end, Keller, who rents many properties in the city, 

said it’s important that students understand the commitment 
they’re making when signing a lease and find a house that fits 
their needs and budget.

“They don’t really know and they are willing to sign things 

because they like a house, they think it’s pretty, or they don’t 
read the lease — or worse, they sign with (a company) whose 
lease is garbage,” he said. “There is certainly a naivety.”

Personal Statement: My mother’s strength

by Jen Calfas, Editor in Chief

T

he room, dark and quiet — except for the slow, 
concentrated steps we made. Her eyes, closed; her 
mouth, frowning.

The doctors told us to wake her up, but they were 

nowhere to be found. My aunt and dad grabbed each of her 
hands with a soft touch, and whispered.

Her eyes came up slowly, and she furrowed her brow. 

I stood at the end of the long bed, but she didn’t see me. 
“The lymph nodes...” my mom inquired, groggy, confused, 
in pain.

“You’re clear,” my dad whispered, his eyes wide. “There 

is no cancer in your lymph nodes.”

My mom didn’t believe him. Her memory lasted just a 

few moments until she asked again: “The lymph nodes?” 
After several reminders, her eyes opened widely. “Where’s 
Jen? Is she here?”

I took my dad’s place and held her hand. “I’m so happy 

you’re here. Thank you, Jen.”

I didn’t recognize the tears forming in my eyes until 

three small drops hit her white sheets. I quickly wiped the 
wet marks streaming down my face when she looked at my 
aunt. At this moment, she moved her hands to feel where 
her breasts once were, and winced.

***

My mom told me she had breast cancer at the end of my 

junior year of college. The news hit us hard. Never did I 
ever imagine something touching the indestructable. How 
could something like this happen to a woman who caught a 
snake and asked if I wanted to hold it, too, when I was just 
nine years old? The woman who encouraged me to play on 
the arborous hillside by our suburban house, to get scrapes 
and scars on my knees, to save the lizard my cat brought 
into the house for show?

She first told me after I returned home to California this 

May. I was registered for a half marathon in Santa Barba-
ra in a few days, so I went for a long run my first morning 
back. Before returning home, I texted my mom: “Can we 
ride the horses today?” “Possibly!”

Possibly! didn’t feel right. I locked my phone and drove 

home.

I came through our back door to find my parents sitting 

in the kitchen, waiting. I followed them to our living room, 
confused by their serious faces. My chest filled with dif-
ficulty with each breath.

“I found a lump in my breast,” my mom said, her voice 

wobbling. Before she said anything else, I started crying. 
“It’s breast cancer,” she finished after my hands already 
covered my face.

My breathing grew more difficult; my tears more full; 

my stomach more twisted. But it cleared over time. I real-
ized that after 21 years of her unwavering support, care and 
comfort, it was my responsibility to provide the same for 
her.

***

Several days later, my mom and I were down working in 

our barn and missed more than ten calls from my dad. We 
came back to find a message from him saying the doctors at 
the University of Southern California’s Keck Medical Cen-
ter would be able to squeeze my mom’s double mastectomy 
in on Thursday. It was Monday.

At first I smiled giddily at my mom. I knew she wanted 

the cancer out immediately, and this surgery would do just 
that. But, after a few moments of excitement, she broke 
down. Thursday was so soon — she wasn’t mentally ready. 
As she sat in her chair at her desk, I wrapped my arms 
around her for I’m not sure how long. Eventually I lowered 
to the floor, leaned against her legs, and watched mindless 
TV with her for the rest of the night.

The next few days were a blur. My parents had appoint-

ment after appointment in Downtown; my aunt flew from 
Gilroy; I asked my then-boyfriend to cancel his visit to Cal-
ifornia the upcoming weekend (which, of course, my self-
less mom felt horrible about).

And then it was finally Thursday. My dad and aunt went 

to the hospital with my mom while I stayed at home. “The 
surgery will be a while,” my dad told me. “You should come 

around 6:00 or 7:00 to be there when she wakes up.”

So I waited.

***

Something hit me when I saw my mother, without her 

breasts, in her hospital gown that Thursday evening. It 
went beyond the cancer — or, at this point, lack thereof 
— that poisoned my mother and threatened her life. I feel 
immature to have been taken aback by my mother’s imme-
diate physical change, but I can’t hide from it.

Her most maternal physical attributes were gone, and 

I couldn’t quite comprehend it. And I still can’t. Though 
her final reconstructive surgery will be just days after this 
article is published, I will always remember that feeling. 
The feeling of growing up, of caring for another person far 
more than yourself, of weakness and strength all at once.

My mother, a survivor, is indestructible. I always knew 

this about her: she was the youngest of six in a single-moth-
er home; she began working at 14 to save money for college; 
she sacrificed her teaching career to take care of me and 
my two sisters; she loves us unequivocally. And she’s been 
through much more strife that I can’t put into words here.

It was my turn to be strong for her. During her stay at 

the hospital, I only exited the room once to cry; seeing her 
in pain was so difficult. But through all the pain, she was 
never worried about herself — she was worried about how 
me and my sisters were doing. And I had to show her how 
her strength inspired us to be a support system for her now.

Months later, my mom always reminds me of how fortu-

nate it was that her diagnosis and surgery happened during 
my longest period of time at home in nearly two years (and 
likely from now on). But since the summer, the conversa-
tion has returned to my antics: my recent breakup, my job 
at The Michigan Daily, my nerves about life post-grad. My 
mom has returned to a position of stability and support for 
me, and I have not stayed the same support system for her 
as I was for those few weeks several months ago.

Perhaps some day I’ll be like her. Until then, I’ll try to 

follow her lead.

Personal Statement: This day was different

by Marlee Breakstone, Daily Staff Reporter

A

s a fairly liberal person growing up in the predomi-
nantly conservative town of Southbury, Connecti-
cut, I’m used to being in the company of those whose 

beliefs are not in accordance with my own. Because of my 
upbringing, I am accustomed to acknowledging such differ-
ences without allowing them to alter my ability to function 
as if they didn’t exist.

This day was different.
As I walked into school that morning, an ominous quiet 

surrounded me. I thought this odd, for the amount of people 
trafficking the hall was typical of any other day. Provoked by 
a sense of curiosity and bewilderment, I approached one of 
my classmates and asked her why nobody was speaking. She 
simply pointed to a ribbon that was tied around her wrist and 
walked away without uttering a word.

I soon learned that my silent classmates were taking part 

in a school-wide protest against the legality of abortions. All 
students and faculty who wished to participate tied red rib-
bons around their wrists and took an oath of silence, sacri-
ficing their own voices in honor of those who never had the 
chance to use theirs.

My voice that day angered those around me. Some pass-

ersby in the hallway scowled at me when they heard me talk, 
but other than that I made it through most of the day without 
any major conflicts. It was not until later in the day that I was 
forced to verbally defend my own choice not to remain silent.

As I approached my Spanish class, I was surprised to see 

my teacher waiting by the door, handing a ribbon to each stu-
dent. When she offered me one, I politely declined. I then sat 
at my desk and anxiously waited for the day’s lesson to begin. 
My teacher closed the door and turned to face the class. 
Instead of approaching the whiteboard, as she typically did, 
she walked slowly towards my desk and bent down so that 
her face was a mere two or three inches from mine. She then 
stretched out her arm and opened her hand, revealing a red 
ribbon.

“Take it, Marlee,” she said as she plucked the ribbon out 

of her own palm and dangled it in front of my face. “I’ll even 
help you to tie it onto your wrist.”

When she grabbed my arm and attempted to forcefully 

fasten the piece of red silky cloth around my wrist, I quickly 
recoiled. This angered her. She told me that I was wrong, that 
I was uncooperative and that I did not care whether or not 
innocent babies were killed. 

Internally appalled but externally calm, I rose from my 

desk and walked to the center of the room. I explained to 
my class that school was not a place for political protest and 
that I was disappointed in Mrs. Griffin for allowing her own 
opinions to infringe upon her ability to teach. I explained 
that, though she was entitled to her beliefs, she was in no 
position to impose them on her students. Based on Mrs. Grif-
fin’s silence, I felt that I had gotten my point across.

Silence is a powerful force, for it holds the potential to 

make one either discernibly commanding or utterly meek. 
Though using my voice generated a great deal of controversy, 
I would not hesitate to repeat my actions. Certainly, it would 
have been easier for me to fulfill Mrs. Griffin’s wish and wear 
the ribbon. After that day, she treated me differently than 
she did my peers. She spoke to me with a condescending tone 
and constantly criticized every aspect of my being. I discov-
ered that it is better to speak your mind and face the conse-
quences than to silently conform and become exactly what 
society pressures you to be. I exhibited my own strength and 
willingness to act in discordance to those around me in order 
to defend my own beliefs.

This experience was essential in molding me into the per-

son I am today. After reflecting, I am able to identify myself 
as someone who is driven, outspoken, compassionate and 
bold. I am not afraid of controversy; I am not afraid to take 
a stand. Though this experience was horrific, I don’t regret 
having it. It was the water that was necessary to nourish the 
seeds of my personality and help me sprout into my true self.

Chautauqua Institution is a a non-profit adult education center 

and living community located in Western New York. Originally 
it was founded as a Methodist learning community in 1878. Since 
then its religious community has grown to include 16 different 
denominations. As the cost of staying in the Institution has increased, 
the denominational houses have been regarded as the most affordable 
option for visitors.

For the past nine years, Bud and Pat Brown have volunteered to be 

the hosts of the Baptist House. They have stayed in the Baptist House 
since they started coming to Chautauqua in 1977.

V I S U A L S T A T E M E N T : 

Bad and Pat are active members of the community of Chautauqua. Bud is a 
member of the Chautauqua choir and attends rehearsals throughout the week. 

Every Tuesday Bud and Pat host a social hour where they invite singers and musicians from the Chautauqua Community 
to perform in their house. 

Pat and Bud share a quiet moment on the Baptist front porch during a Tuesday social hour. Bud says that when he first 
dropped Pat off in Chautauqua she cried because she didn’t know anyone, but when Bud came to pick her up she cried 
because she didn’t want to leave. Now Bud and Pat play important roles in the Chautauquan community. 

Pat tearfully says goodbye to Alex Paul on the porch of the Baptist House. Pat and Bud allowed Paul to stay for free throughout 
out the summer so she could be a member of the choir and covered the cost of her room out of their own pocket. 

Photo Essay by Ruby Wallau

As hosts, they describe their job as to be “gracious to everyone who comes inside the front door”. Most 

of their responsibilities as hosts include physical tasks such as cleaning and day to day maintenance. They 
also host Sunday worship services, Thursday vesper services, Tuesday social hours, pot luck dinners for their 
guests, and volunteer their time for various Institution programming. 

Bud and Pat met working as librarians in the Robbins Library in Arlington, Massachusetts. As the story 

goes, one day Pat’s sister returned home and told her that there was a man in the library. After hearing this, 
Pat jumped on her bike and rushed over to meet Bud. Since then, they’ve been married for 49 years and have 
spent most of that time living in Buffalo and working as librarians.
