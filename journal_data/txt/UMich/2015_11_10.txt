Former faculty, staff 
discuss similarities 

between past, 
present climate

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Though the event’s original 

intent was to convene a group of 
leaders to speak about the history 
of campus activism and diversity 
efforts, a panel discussion Monday 
afternoon instead largely focused 
on the fact that past grievances 
related to many issues of race and 
gender at the University continue 
to hold true today.

“It’s sad to think it is 2015 and 

we’re talking about the same stuff 
we talked about in ’49 when the 
first Black woman was allowed to 
live in a dormitory,” said panelist 
Charles 
Moody, 
vice 
provost 

emeritus for minority affairs.

Along 
with 
Moody, 
four 

other panelists discussed their 
experiences working to foster an 
inclusive community for minority 
students on campus: Associate 
Prof. Maria Cotera, former director 

of the Latina/o Studies Program; 
University alum Cynthia Stephens, 
a judge of the Michigan Court of 
Appeals; Abigail Stewart, director 
of the ADVANCE program, which 
aims to advocate for female 
faculty in science and engineering 
fields and the former director of 
the Women’s Studies Program; 
and James Toy, co-founder and 
former director of the Spectrum 
Center, then known as the Human 
Sexuality Office.

Lester Monts, a professor of 

music and former senior vice 
provost 
for 
academic 
affairs, 

moderated the conversation.

The panel was part of the 

University’s 
campus-wide 

diversity summit, which is to 
be headlined by an interview 
between 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel and Pulitzer Prize-
winning journalist Clarence Page 
Tuesday morning.

The summit is a piece of 

Schlissel’s ongoing Strategic Plan 
for Diversity, which he launched in 
September by asking each campus 
school or department to design 
its own internal programs for 
enhancing diversity.

Robert Sellers, vice provost for 

President says 
rhetoric must be 

matched with 

progress

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

Ahead of Tuesday’s diversity 

summit, 
University 
President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
attended 

Monday’s 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee on University Affairs 
meeting to discuss the impending 
school-wide diversity plan and 
the importance of balancing 
rhetoric with substantive action.

Monday marked Schlissel’s first 

time at SACUA since appearing 
there last November. During that 
visit, Schlissel spoke candidly 
about the University’s athletics 
program — a conversation that 
drew both praise and criticism.

On Monday, Schlissel said 

gathering input from as many 
people as possible will give the 
University’s diversity plan the 
greatest likelihood for success. 
However, he also acknowledged 
that it will take time to complete 
and implement.

“The thing I like about this 

process is that it’s the most 
bottom-up thing I’ve ever done,” 
he said. “It would be an easier 
and faster process if we took a 
group like this, sat in a room 10 
times and issued a plan for the 
University of Michigan. Strangely 

enough, that’s too easy.”

While encouraging patience 

during the long-term planning 
process, Schlissel also pointed to 
diversity initiatives the University 
has already implemented.

He pointed to the HAIL 

scholarship 
and 
the 
new 

Wolverine Pathways program, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
increased 

numbers 
of 
underrepresented 

minorities in this year’s freshman 
class, as evidence of tangible 
improvement. 
Schlissel 
noted 

the administration’s talk about 
increased diversity must continue 
to be supported by “concrete 
actions” like these.

“Any time that we devote a 

significant amount of time to 
talking, then we really do have to 
prove to people that talking leads 
to substance,” he said.

Following the discussion on 

diversity, SACUA chair Silke-
Maria Weineck, a professor of 
comparative literature, asked for 
Schlissel’s thoughts on Tim Wolfe 
— the University of Missouri 
system president who resigned 
Monday 
amid 
allegations 
of 

mishandling incidents of racism 
on the school’s campus.

“I don’t really understand 

enough about the circumstances 
in Missouri to have an opinion on 
it, I’ve only been following it for 
the last couple of days,” Schlissel 
said. “What was interesting was 
at the end of the series of events 
that led to his resignation, there 
were some pretty forceful student 

#StandWithAlex 

draws support 
for grad student 

terminated from job

By ALYSSA BRANDON 

and EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporters

On Monday, the University’s 

Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization filled a hallway 
of 
the 
Taubman 
College 
of 

Architecture and Urban Planning 
and tweeted #StandWithelx to 
protest the firing of a graduate 
student instructor.

Alex Chen, a third-year dual 

degree master’s student in the 
Taubman College and the School 
of Engineering, was hired as 
a Taubman GSI in August and 
signed an employment contract, 
before receiving an e-mail a day 
later stating she was not fit for the 
position. The reason — according 
to protest organizers — cited by the 
University was that she was not a 
Taubman student, as the majority 
of the classes she was enrolled in 
were for her Engineering program.

Because she was fired from her 

position as a GSI, Chen lost her 
tuition waiver, health care and the 
salary she anticipated. According 
to GEO President John Ware, an 
Engineering graduate student, the 
loss has resulted in nearly $50,000 
in debt for Chen and a hold on her 
account so she cannot graduate.

Young Americans 
for Freedom mimic 

Berlin Wall, 26 
years after its fall

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

Twenty-six years after the 

Berlin Wall fell in Germany, 
the first blows were delivered 
to the make-shift wall on 
the 
Diag 
constructed 
by 

the 
University’s 
Young 

Americans 
for 
Freedom 

chapter. The wall, created 
to honor the anniversary of 
the real wall’s destruction, 
was built to protest political 
correctness, 
according 
to 

YAF chairman Grant Strobl, 
an LSA sophomore.

“Right now the bias hotline 

is 
against 
free 
speech,” 

Strobl said. “You can report 
a bias crime just because it’s 
offensive. That’s not in the 
constitution.”

Strobl is referring to the 

University’s telephone hotline 
and online forms available for 
directly reporting hate crimes 
on campus.

Members 
of 
the 

organization passed around 
a mallet, each taking a turn 
to smash the wall, which 
was covered with words like 
“safe space” and “trigger 
warnings.”

However, 
the 
display 

was not perceived well by 
many of those who passed 

by, including LSA freshman 
Kevin Sweitzer.

“It ignores all the progress 

we’ve made on promoting 
political 
correctness, 
and 

social 
justice 
across 
the 

University,” 
Sweitzer 
said. 

“It just puts it on some wall 
for some people who are 
privileged 
to 
take 
turns 

beating at. It’s unbelievable. 
This is a bias incident, and it 
needs to stop.”

For many of the students 

who stopped to watch the 
display, confusion centered 
around what YAF was aiming 
to 
accomplish. 
Additional 

oppositions 
were 
voiced, 

particularly by one student, 
LSA 
sophomore 
Fahim 

Rahman.

On anniversary of 
Rosser death, locals 
continue to advocate 

for change

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

After more than a year of 

national protests calling for an 
end to police brutality, Matthew 

Lassiter, an associate history 
professor, 
decided 
University 

students might be interested in 
learning more about criminal 
justice issues in the United States.

“I think there are a lot of 

undergraduate 
students 
and 

graduate students who have 
gotten really involved and really 
interested in the history of mass 
incarceration … so I wanted to 
bring in two scholars who have 
written a lot about this topic,” 
he said.

On 
Monday, 
Lassiter 

moderated a discussion between 
guest panelists Donna Murch, 
associate professor of history at 
Rutgers University, and Heather 
Ann Thompson, professor of 
Afroamerican 
and 
African 

Studies, to discuss these issues 
in depth.

Sponsored 
by 
the 

Metropolitan History Workshop, 
the Department of Afroamerican 
and African Studies, and the 
Program in Race, Law and 

History, the event drew about 
80 
undergraduates, 
graduate 

students and faculty members.

Both Murch and Thompson 

are leading historians on topics 
such as race, incarceration, black 
power, civil rights, criminal 
justice and the war on drugs, and 
both have forthcoming books on 
these topics.

One important topic discussed 

was the difference between mass

$1.5 million grant to provide 
care for underserved Detroiters

Professor hosts roundtable 
on history of incarceration

Nursing School 
partners with 

community health 

organization

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

As part of an expanded part-

nership between the University’s 
School of Nursing and the Detroit 
n0n-profit Community Health and 
Social Services, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Ser-
vices has allocated a $1.5 million 
grant to help improve care for 
underserved populations.

CHASS, a Detroit-based com-

munity 
organization, 
provides 

primary health care and support 
services. The program aims to 
apply chronic disease manage-
ment to address diabetes, car-
diovascular disease, asthma and 

mental health issues.

This grant is the second $1.5 

million gift awarded to the Nurs-
ing School and CHASS. The 
first grant, awarded in 2010, was 
intended to be three-year provi-
sion to fund nurse practitioners 
who would help increase access 
to primary health care in under-
served areas.

This year’s grant will allow 

Registered Nurse Chronic Care 
Coordinators to lead teams of doc-
tors, pharmacists, support staff 
and social workers in the provision 
of health care in impoverished 
communities.

Donna 
Marvicsin, 
Nursing 

School clinical associate profes-
sor, was the recipient of the initial 
grant and will serve as project 
director of the new program as 
well.

“This first grant resulted with 

a wonderful partnership with 
CHASS that then — because we 
had this community relationship, 
we had the trust — it allowed us 

then to be in the position to get the 
second grant,” she said.

The grant’s first goal is to 

facilitate training for CHASS 
employees with University profes-
sionals. Though Marvicsin said 
no University hospital nurses will 
participate in the program, under-
graduate Nursing students will 
have the opportunity to gain clini-
cal experience at CHASS.

Marvicsin said the Nursing 

School will act as a consultant for 
CHASS, to ensure the new train-
ing is properly completed and 
efficient communication occurs 
between patients and their prima-
ry caregivers.

“In a primary care clinic, it’s 

just so busy, it’s hard to start new 
programs and make sure they’re 
sustained,” she said.

Marvicsin said communication 

training is vital for an interdisci-
plinary team.

“What they find with teams is 

usually interprofessional work-
ers have different ways of com-
munication and different culture 
within health care providers,” 
she said. “We’re going to make 
sure that everyone is trained with 
cross interprofessional cultures 
and communication for successful 
teamwork.”

The program includes training 

in communication skills, decision 
making, care coordination and 
problem solving.

The second part of the program 

includes work with IT profes-
sionals. The aim is to ensure all 
patients’ health care information 
is documented properly in elec-
tronic health records.

The grant also aspires to help 

patients whose chronic conditions 
require frequent visits to health 
care professionals, in cases where 
health care professionals require 
the details of their patients’ cases 
before they even enter the clinic.

“These are patients who are 

established, they have diabetes, 
they have hypertension, they have 
high cholesterol. So they’re known 
to the clinic and they’re followed 
closely,” she said.

JAKE MOYER

Friends from frisbee 

Kinesiology junior Jake 

Moyer calls himself an unof-
ficial leader of one of the 
University’s less publicized 
sports: Ultimate Frisbee. He 
plays for MagnUM, a team 
that consists of more than 30 
members who come together 
to play in a handful of tour-
naments each fall.

What exactly is Ultimate 

Frisbee?

I didn’t even know when 

I got to school, because I’d 
never played before. At the 
collegiate level, it’s 7 v 7. At 
the beginning of each point, 
there’s an offense and a 
defense. The purpose is to get 
the Frisbee into the opposite 

end zone by passing it up the 
field.

What is your role on the 

team?

I’m a third-year player, so 

my role has gotten bigger. I’m 
one of the unofficial leaders 
on the team. I’m definitely 
expected to perform on the 
field athletically, and even 
off the field, I’ve been really 
involved with putting togeth-
er our apparel orders and a lot 
of behind-the-scenes things, 
too.

How did you get involved 

with the team?

I was walking through Fes-

tifall my freshman year and … 
one of the guys made eye con-
tact with me, and handed me 
a flier. I saw that the tryouts 
were the next day, so I talked 
to my twin, Bobby, about it 
and we decided to do it.

What is the best part 

about playing for the Ulti-

mate Frisbee team?

Those are my best friends 

that I’ve made here at 
school. It kinda just fell in 
my lap, and they’re really 
awesome people. I live with 
them, and hang out with 
them. The best part about 
it is building those friend-
ships.

IN PE R SPECTIVE 

Panelists consider 
racial bias in the 

U.S. criminal 
justice system

By MAYA KALMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

After more than a year of 

national protests calling for an 
end to police brutality, Matthew 
Lassiter, an associate history 
professor, decided University stu-
dents might be interested in 
learning more about criminal jus-
tice issues in the United States.

“I think there are a lot of under-

graduate students and graduate 
students who have gotten really 
involved and really interested 
in the history of mass incarcera-
tion … so I wanted to bring in two 
scholars who have written a lot 
about this topic,” he said.

On Monday, Lassiter moder-

ated a discussion between guest 
panelists Donna Murch, associ-
ate professor of history at Rut-
gers University, and Heather 

Ann Thompson, professor of 
Afroamerican and African Stud-
ies, to discuss these issues in 
depth.

Sponsored by the Metropolitan 

History Workshop, the Depart-
ment of Afroamerican and Afri-
can Studies, and the Program in 
Race, Law and History, the event 
drew about 80 undergraduates, 
graduate students and faculty 
members.

Both Murch and Thompson 

are leading historians on topics 
such as race, incarceration, black 
power, civil rights, criminal jus-
tice and the war on drugs, and 
both have forthcoming books on 
these topics.

One important topic discussed 

was the difference between mass 
incarceration and the carceral 
state. Murch said the carceral 
state “entails multiple forms of 
surveillance, control and confine-
ment … the carceral has to do with 
when state institutions take on a 
punishing function.”

“Mass incarceration is the 

symptom. The carceral state is 
the cause,” Thompson said. “We’ll 
have a carceral state even if we let 

a million and a half people out of 
prison and we go back to levels of 
1970.”

The discussion also explored 

the rise of juvenile incarceration, 
and who is responsible for the 
policies that encouraged these 
incarceration trends, as well as 
mass incarceration.

The issue of mass incarcera-

tion is polarizing: some say it’s a 
result of policy shift in the 1960s 
and 1970s, while others say it’s 
due to a longstanding tradition 
of imprisonment. Some camps of 
social scientists argue the trend is 
a result of de-industrialization or 
under-policing of Black neighbor-
hoods.

The event began with a short 

lecture by each of the guest pan-
elists. Murch, who is considered a 
pioneer in the study of mass incar-
ceration through a historical lens, 
spoke about the development of of 
research on the carceral state.

She said the group of histori-

ans working on the topic is very 
small, and research has been lim-
ited until very recently due to bias 
against the subjects of research, 
See CRIMINAL JUSTICE, Page 3


such as the Black Panthers.

“There’s been a profound 

shift, a historiographical shift, 
one might say, a political shift, 
that’s made it possible to write 
about radical anti-state orga-
nizations that was absolutely 
not true when I was in graduate 
school,” she said.

Murch was working on a book 

on the Black Panthers when she 
realized the history of incarcera-
tion is central to research on race 
and marginalized groups.

“It started out very empirical-

ly, with trying to understand why 
such large numbers of southern 
born migrants ended up in juve-
nile systems,” she said.

The study of the carceral state 

also has implications for other 
areas of study, such as research 
on crime and drug policy.

“It’s very difficult to write 

about a drug economy without 
dealing with the state apparatus 
of punishment,” she said.

Most recently, Murch has 

studied political mobilization 
in current social movements 
against mass incarceration and 
police brutality. She travelled to 
Ferguson, Mo. after last year’s 
protests, following the fatal 
shooting of an unarmed, Black 
teenager by a white police officer, 
to study the “explosion of activ-
ism” there. She said these kind of 
events are important for shaping 
how researchers reinterpret the 
period in which incarceration 
rates soared in the U.S.

Thompson began her discus-

sion by agreeing with Murch’s 
assertion that many historians 
who study incarceration stum-
bled on the topic while study-
ing other things. Thompson, for 
example, came across the topic 
while working on a book about 
Black activism and civil rights in 
Detroit.

“We all came to this quite as a 

surprise to ourselves,” she said. 
“I didn’t even see in my own 
book, which is fundamentally 
about police brutality and funda-
mentally about the carceral state 
… I didn’t understand what a car-
ceral state was. I didn’t see the 
forest for the trees.”

Thompson also worked on 

a book about the Attica Prison 
Riot, which took place in the 
Attica Correctional Facility in 
1971. While working on the book, 
Thompson realized the connec-
tion between civil rights and the 
increasing incarceration rate. 
She recounted asking of herself, 
“Well wait a minute, something 
happens after Attica. After 1971 
we start to lock everybody up. 
What’s the relationship? Is there 
a connection here?”

She also noted that this body 

of research has been largely 
fueled by women and feminists, 
and that experts in this area have 
recently been called upon to edu-
cate legislators in Washington, 
D.C., an unusual request for his-
torians.

One question she answered in 

Washington was how to accom-
modate the wealthy interest 
groups and corporations who, 
like legislators and historians, 
believe in decarceration, but 
don’t know what to do when this 
decarceration happens. She sug-
gested funds be diverted from 
the prison system into social wel-
fare, charter schools and other 
services that will help those most 
affected by the incarceration 
trend.

“I thought (the event) went 

pretty well,” Lassiter said. “We 
got some really good questions, 
including a number of really 
good ones from undergrads. We 
didn’t resolve anything today, but 
that’s not how historical discus-
sions usually happen. The goal 
is to ask the right questions as 
much as finding easy answers.”

Chen sought support from 

the GEO to submit a grievance 
hearing to Taubman College.

Ware said the GEO believes 

Taubman 
College 
breached 

protections outlined in Article 
9 of its collective bargaining 
agreement with the University. 
The article states that once an 
offer has been made to a potential 
GSI and the GSI signs a contract, 
the duties can be changed or taken 
away completely, but the pay, 
benefits and tuition waiver can be 
no less than what was promised.

“This is one of the articles in 

our contract that is most dear to 
us,” Ware said. “In addition to it 
being an awful situation for Alex, 
who doesn’t deserve to be in the 
situation that she’s in, it’s also a 
threat to job security for all GSIs.”

According to Ware, Taubman 

College has declined to overturn 

their decisions thus far in prior 
grievance hearings for Chen. 
Monday’s 
protest 
occurred 

during 
her 
third 
grievance 

hearing with Academic Human 
Resources. Ware said a mix of 
more than 100 graduate and 
undergraduate 
students 
and 

University 
alumni 
attended 

Monday’s 
demonstration, 

but were denied access to the 
grievance hearing.

Upon request for comment on 

the issue, University spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 
said 
Monday 

evening he could not discuss the 
matter.

“It’s not appropriate to discuss 

these types of personnel issues 
publicly,” he said. “This matter 
is being addressed appropriately 
through the process outlined in 
the GEO collective bargaining 
agreement.”

Ware said many people were 

intersted in learning the outcome 
of Monday’s hearing.

“Everybody that was at the 

Taubman building today came 
hoping to watch the meeting,” 
Ware said. “We did request a room 
large enough for that to take place, 
but (Human Resources) took the 
position that they didn’t want any 
spectators in the meeting.”

According to Ware, officials 

closed the blinds in the meeting 
room 
and 
held 
the 
meeting 

privately while four or five police 
officers monitored protesters from 
a classroom next door.

The department will have 30 

days to consider Chen’s case before 
they release a final decision. During 
that time, Ware said the GEO plans 
to appear before the University’s 
Board of Regents to argue Chen’s 
case.

“We 
hope 
that 
Human 

Resources, 
being 
intimately 

familiar with our contract and 
knowing 
what 
the 
contract 

requirements are, we hope they 
will overturn the decision, and that 
we’ll get Alex what she deserves,” 
he said. 

“It’s ridiculous,” Rahman 

said. 
“Protesting 
against 

political correctness … I’m 
of course not for that, but I 
(also) think it’s really weird 
to equate that that to the 
Berlin Wall. It doesn’t make 
any sense.”

Passersby spoke with YAF 

members about the purpose 
of the display. The wall had 
words 
like 
“protect 
left 

handed people” and “report 
me” 
spray 
painted 
in 
a 

graffiti-like fashion. 

“We chose words that were 

all part of this politically 
correct effort, to replicate an 
environment where people 
are coerced into silence from 
expressing 
their 
beliefs,” 

Strobl said.

Students 
said 
they 

felt 
some 
groups 
were 

marginalized by the words 
written on the wall.

“I believe that people’s 

identities 
are 
being 

challenged 
based 
on 

the words on the wall,” 
Sweitzer said. “People who 
have 
suffered 
traumatic 

experience — you need to be 
aware of that when watching 
a movie in class, or just going 
through life.”

The 
aim 
of 
the 
day, 

according to Strobl, was to 
draw connections between 
instances of institutionalized 
censorship.

“It is our mission to fight 

for 
freedom 
of 
speech, 

intellectual discussion and 
dialogue and the opportunity 
to engage in this dialogue 
as a University,” Strobl said. 
“If we didn’t have this event 
today, I wouldn’t have had 
tons of discussions about this 
today.”

Theme semesters to 
celebrate University 
bicentennial 

The University announced 

Tuesday it will devote courses 
in the 2017 winter and fall 
semesters 
to 
celebrate 
its 

bicentennial. 

According to a statment form 

Bicentennial Communications, 
the winter theme semester, 
titled “The Making of the 
University of Michigan,” will 
highlight the history of the 
University. 

The fall 2017 theme semester, 

“Michigan 
Horizons: 
The 

Possible 
Futures 
of 
U-M,” 

will focus on the challenges 
and dilemmas facing both the 
University and higher education 
at large. 

Theme 
semester 
planning 

was chaired by Howard Brick, a 
professor of history and director 
of the Eisenberg Institute for 
Historical Studies. 

Classes cancelled 
at UM-Dearborn 
after mall shooting 

Police 
confirmed 
Monday 

afternoon that shots were fired 
in Fairlane Mall in Dearborn, 
Michigan.

The shooting prompted both 

a lockdown of the mall and the 
University’s Dearborn campus, 
which is located across the 
street. 

Classes 
at 
the 
Dearborn 

campus were cancelled and 
students were encouraged to 
remain indoors. 

According 
to 
police, 
the 

shooting 
occurred 
after 
a 

dispute between two people 
escalated. 

No 
 
injuries 
have 
been 

reporterd. No arrests have been 
made in connection with the 
incident. 

Wayne County 
to build pier at 
wildlife refuge 

The Wayne County com-

mission voted unanimously to 
approve $1 million deal to build 
a boat dock and pier at a wildlife 
refuge. 

The commission made the 

agreement with the Downriver 
Community Conference. The 
conference is an alliance of 20 
Wayne County cities and town-
ships dedicated to improving 
the Detroit River International 
Wildlife Refuge Gateway in 
Trenton and Gibraltar. 

Plans for the project include 

for a 755-foot boat dock and 
pier that will accommodate 
100 people. A floating pier will 
house a boat from the Michigan 
Sea Grant program. The pro-
gram, backed by the Univeristy 
and Michigan State University, 
funds research, education and 
training projects about con-
servation and use of the Great 
Lakes

The project is anticipated to 

be completed in 2017. 

In light of student 
outcry, Missouri 
president resigns

Timothy 
Wolfe, 
president 

of the University of Missouri, 
announced he would resign 
Monday after students demand-
ed he step down for his alleged 
lack of attention to racial issues 
on campus. 

Following the painting of a 

swastika on a campus building, 
students at the school began 
protesting 
the 
university’s 

administration. 
One 
student 

pledged he would not eat until 
Wolfe resigned. 

The Missouri football team 

also pledged they would not 
partipate in any football-related 
activities until Wolfe stepped 
down. 

In his final speech to the Uni-

veristy of Missouri community, 
Wolfe said he hopes his resinga-
tion was a step toward healing 
on the campus.

equity, inclusion and academic 
affairs, introduced the panel, 
explaining that its aim was to 
contextualize the current state of 
diversity at the University before 
continuing to develop future plans 
later in the week.

“Whatever progress we make 

in the future has already been 
purchased by the blood, sweat 
and tears of those who have come 
before us,” Sellers said. “Whatever 
heights we reach in the future, we 
can only reach those heights by 
standing on the shoulders of the 
gargantuan contributions of those 
who have come before us.”

Cotera argued that despite the 

University’s history as a leader in 

promoting diversity on campus — 
most notably through defending 
affirmative action in the 2003 
U.S. Supreme Court case Gratz 
v. Bollinger — the administrative 
leadership has often minimized its 
commitment to diversity.

She cited the critically low 

enrollment numbers for Black 
and Native American students 
— 4.82 percent and 0.25 percent, 
respectively. Noting a lack of 
administrative 
leadership 
in 

recruiting and retaining faculty 
of color, Cotera said the campus 
climate for minority students is 
unwelcoming.

“Not a week goes by that a 

student of color, whether graduate 
or undergraduate, does not come 
crying in my office,” she said. “It 
happens every week.”

Stephens 
said 
the 
low 

enrollment numbers for minority 
students is also due to the 
normalization of microaggressions 
on campus. She said many students 
of color believe the University is a 
hostile place for minorities, even 
before they set foot on campus.

“The University needs to come 

to understand that that 4 percent is 
in part based on how the University 
does business,” she said.

Despite 
the 
critical 
words 

panelists had for racial diversity 
on campus, Toy remarked on 
how receptive and courageous 
the University was when he first 
conceived the Human Sexuality 
Office in 1971. 

“The University took, I believe, 

an enormous risk in creating what 
we now refer to as the Spectrum 
Center,” Toys said.

In addition to panel members, 

a number of other distinguished 
campus 
leaders 
attended 
the 

discussion, 
including 
Nellie 

Varner, the first Black regent at 
the University; Harold Johnson, 
the first Black dean; and Henry 
Johnson, former vice president of 
student affairs and the first Black 
vice president.

Business 
sophomore 
Dhara 

Gosalia said she said left the 
event 
feeling 
that 
achieving 

a 
more 
diverse 
University 

community must occur through 
an institutional, systemic way.

“When I came in, I expected 

them to talk more about the 
history, but I thought it was really 
cool that they connected it to the 
present times,” she said.

Rackham 
student 
Tissyana 

Camacho said the panel made 
her realize how the University 

will need to remain committed to 
attaining a diverse student body 
for a while before achieving it 
achieves goals for inclusion.

“I think my biggest takeaway 

was realizing that this is something 
that is a long-term commitment,” 
Camacho said. “I think many if not 
all of the panelists discussed that 
the change is not going to happen 
overnight.”

Toward 
the 
end 
of 
the 

discussion, 
all 
panelists 

encouraged 
senior 
leaders 

and 
administrators, 
not 
just 

students and faculty, to make 
campus inclusion a priority at the 
University.

“We need everybody involved,” 

Stewart said. “We know that when 
institutional change happens it 
happens when it converges from 
bottom up, top down leadership.”

state. Murch said the carceral 
state 
“entails 
multiple 
forms 

of 
surveillance, 
control 
and 

confinement … the carceral has 
to do with when state institutions 
take on a punishing function.”

“Mass incarceration is the 

symptom. The carceral state 
is the cause,” Thompson said. 
“We’ll have a carceral state even 
if we let a million and a half 
people out of prison and we go 
back to levels of 1970.”

The discussion also explored 

the rise of juvenile incarceration, 
and who is responsible for the 
policies that encouraged these 
incarceration trends, as well as 
mass incarceration.

The 
issue 
of 
mass 

incarceration is polarizing: some 
say it’s a result of policy shift in 
the 1960s and 1970s, while others 
say it’s due to a longstanding 
tradition 
of 
imprisonment. 

Some camps of social scientists 
argue the trend is a result of 
de-industrialization or under-
policing of Black neighborhoods.

The event began with a 

short lecture by each of the 
guest panelists. Murch, who is 
considered a pioneer in the study 
of mass incarceration through a 
historical lens, spoke about the 
development of of research on 
the carceral state.

She said the group of historians 

working on the topic is very small, 
and research has been limited 
until very recently due to bias 
against the subjects of research, 
such as the Black Panthers.

“There’s been a profound shift, 

a historiographical shift, one 
might say, a political shift, that’s 
made it possible to write about 
radical anti-state organizations 

that was absolutely not true 
when I was in graduate school,” 
she said.

Murch was working on a 

book on the Black Panthers 
when she realized the history of 
incarceration is central to research 
on race and marginalized groups.

“It started out very empirically, 

with trying to understand why 
such large numbers of southern 
born migrants ended up in 
juvenile systems,” she said.

The study of the carceral state 

also has implications for other 
areas of study, such as research 
on crime and drug policy.

“It’s very difficult to write 

about a drug economy without 
dealing with the state apparatus 
of punishment,” she said.

Most recently, Murch has 

studied political mobilization 
in current social movements 
against mass incarceration and 
police brutality. She travelled 
to Ferguson, Mo. after last 
year’s protests, following the 
fatal shooting of an unarmed, 
Black teenager by a white police 
officer, to study the “explosion of 
activism” there. She said these 
kind of events are important 
for shaping how researchers 
reinterpret the period in which 
incarceration rates soared in the 
U.S.

Thompson 
began 
her 

discussion 
by 
agreeing 

with 
Murch’s 
assertion 
that 

many 
historians 
who 
study 

incarceration stumbled on the 
topic while studying other things. 
Thompson, for example, came 
across the topic while working on 
a book about Black activism and 
civil rights in Detroit.

“We all came to this quite as a 

surprise to ourselves,” she said. 
“I didn’t even see in my own 
book, which is fundamentally 
about 
police 
brutality 
and 

fundamentally about the carceral 
state … I didn’t understand what a 
carceral state was. I didn’t see the 
forest for the trees.”

Thompson also worked on 

a book about the Attica Prison 
Riot, which took place in the 
Attica 
Correctional 
Facility 

in 1971. While working on the 
book, Thompson realized the 
connection between civil rights 
and the increasing incarceration 
rate. She recounted asking of 
herself, “Well wait a minute, 
something 
happens 
after 

Attica. After 1971 we start to 
lock 
everybody 
up. 
What’s 

the relationship? Is there a 
connection here?”

She also noted that this body 

of research has been largely 
fueled by women and feminists, 
and that experts in this area 
have 
recently 
been 
called 

upon to educate legislators in 
Washington, D.C., an unusual 
request for historians.

One question she answered 

in Washington was how to 
accommodate 
the 
wealthy 
interest 

groups and corporations who, 
like legislators and historians, 
believe in decarceration, but 
don’t know what to do when 
this decarceration happens. She 
suggested funds be diverted 
from the prison system into 
social welfare, charter schools 
and other services that will 
help those most affected by the 
incarceration trend.

“I thought (the event) went 

pretty well,” Lassiter said. “We 
got some really good questions, 
including a number of really 
good ones from undergrads. We 
didn’t resolve anything today, 
but that’s not how historical 
discussions 
usually 
happen. 

The goal is to ask the right 
questions as much as finding 
easy answers.”

protests.”

Weineck 
also 
asked 
for 

Schlissel’s 
thoughts 
on 
the 

University 
issuing 
a 
formal 

apology to H. Chandler Davis, a 
former University professor.

In 
1954, 
the 
University 

suspended and terminated Davis 
and Mark Nickerson, a tenured 
faculty member, for their refusal 
to provide testimony to a group 
from the U.S. House Committee 
on Un-American Activities — as 
a result of both professors having 
had communist leanings. For 
similar reasons, the University 

suspended but later reinstated 
another 
professor, 
Clement 

Markert. 

Davis, a former communist, 

spent six months in federal 
prison for contempt. Nickerson 
and Markert were identified 
by the committee as potential 
subversives because of their 
former communist sympathies, 
but avoided federal prison by 
citing their Fifth Amendment 
rights.

In 
1990, 
the 
University’s 

Senate 
Assembly 
passed 
a 

resolution regarding the 1954 
incident, 
which 
stated 
the 

faculty “deeply regret the failure 
of the University community 
to 
protect 
the 
fundamental 

values of intellectual freedom at 
that time.” The resolution also 
established an Annual Senate 
Lecture on Academic and on 
Intellectual 
Freedom, 
“The 

University of Michigan Senate’s 
Davis, 
Markert, 
Nickerson 

Lecture 
on 
Academic 
and 

Intellectual Freedom.”

In 
response, 
Schlissel 

questioned whether it is fair to 
condemn decisions made more 
than 60 years ago.

“How do you feel about 

holding people accountable for 
events that happened 60 years 
ago, using much more modern 
viewpoints?” he asked. “It’s 
really easy to look back and say 
‘Gee, these people must really 

have been out of their minds to 
fall in line with McCarthyism 
here 
at 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan.’ ”

He acknowledged that some 

of his hesitation stems from his 
perspective as the University’s 
president.

“I’m 
very 
sensitive, 
now 

that I’m the guy in this seat, 
to somebody 50 or 60 years 
from now looking back on the 
orthodoxy of today and saying 
‘How on earth could that guy 
Schlissel not realize that?’ ” he 
said.

Biology Prof. John Lehman, 

a SACUA member, pointed to 
the United States’ 1988 decision 
to apologize for the internment 

of Japanese-Americans during 
World War II as an example of 
the importance of apologizing 
for an event, even if it comes 
years after the fact.

“It’s not that governments 

haven’t taken steps to rectify or 
receive reconciliation for things 
like the Japanese internment,” 
Lehman said. “I think the 
government was right to turn 
around and say ‘this was a 
mistake and we should be aware 
of this so we don’t make the 
same mistake again.’ ”

Schlissel said he would weigh 

the idea of issuing an apology to 
Davis with his executive team 
and the University’s Board of 
Regents.

Protecting political expression

A

s we rapidly approach the Uni-
versity’s bicentennial, Central 
Student Government is tak-

ing the chance to look 
back at the historical-
ly significant changes 
that University stu-
dents have inspired 
in higher education 
for our country over the years. One of 
those major changes was the collection 
and release of course evaluation data.

The history of course evalua-

tions at the University is undeniable. 
Course evaluations were established 
for students, by students, in 1969. 
Anyone who indicates otherwise is 
spreading a false narrative.

What’s more, Prof. Tim McKay 

provided members of the Senate 
Advisory Committee on University 
Affairs, and subsequently CSG, with a 
1969 student viewpoint in The Michi-
gan Daily that clearly explains the 
true history of course evaluations. 
Students, with the University’s sup-
port, established the Association for 
Course Evaluation, which offered stu-
dents access to course evaluation data 
and counseling to help their peers 
obtain a reliable student perspective 
on courses in their selection process.

After seeing the success of the ACE 

office, every single department in LSA 
— then referred to as the Literary Col-
lege — requested copies of the results, 
which were then used for promotion 
and tenure decisions. Individual pro-
fessors also began approaching the 
ACE office hoping to obtain the stu-
dent feedback for their own benefit, 
and their graduate student instruc-
tors’ benefit. The history here is 
unquestionable; 
students 
brought 

this service and offered it for the bet-
terment of all, and now students are 
unable to access that very service.

On Oct. 26, the Senate Advisory 

Committee on University Affairs 
voted to continue denying students 
access to course evaluation data, in a 
shortsighted and disappointing deci-
sion that does not reflect the origi-
nal purpose of course evaluations. 
Instead, they have attempted to 
indefinitely postpone student access 
to this data by calling for a new 

instrument with no clear timeline. 
While we appreciate the Faculty Sen-
ate’s willingness to collaborate mov-
ing forward, this vote represents a 
roadblock to ensuring informed aca-
demic decision-making by students.

The University currently stands at 

odds with its peer institutions because 
it doesn’t provide course evaluation 
data to its students. Harvard Univer-
sity; Yale University; Princeton Uni-
versity; the University of California, 
Berkeley; Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity; University of Virginia; New York 
University; Stanford University; the 
University of Chicago; Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology; California 
Institute of Technology; Columbia 
University; Duke University; the Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles; and 
countless other institutions are all 
successfully providing their students 
with course evaluation data, while 
our own administration is not. Once 
leaders in course evaluation, the Uni-
versity has since fallen far behind our 
country’s other top schools.

The CSG Executive Board has never 

wanted this to be a battle between 
professors and students, and we have 
worked hard to make that abundantly 
clear. Our goal is to share the true nar-
rative surrounding course evaluation 
data and its historical significance, 
which clarifies why we have course 
evaluation data in the first place.

We are focused on ensuring that 

students ultimately have access to 
course evaluation data. The current 
evaluation instrument certainly has 
room for improvement, and the CSG 
Executive Board will readily partici-
pate in the proposed University-wide 
committee to review the current 
evaluation instrument. However, we 
will not accept an outcome that does 
not give students access to the data 
that was, without question, originally 
collected to support students’ course 
selection decisions. That being said, it’s 
also unrealistic for us to enter a course 
evaluation review process and expect 
that a radically different instrument 
will somehow satisfy all involved.

For that reason, we will stand res-

olute in ensuring full student access 
to course evaluation data by the 

time of course selection for Fall 2016 
courses, whether it is provided by the 
University or a student organization.

We fully recognize the role that 

students must play in this. Ever since 
the school transitioned from paper 
to electronic course evaluations, 
student feedback has dropped nota-
bly. Even still, according to a report 
given to SACUA ahead of their vote, 
the decline in response rates has had 
no statistically significant impact on 
the evaluations. That being said, it’s 
important to note that course evalu-
ation data will only be helpful for 
future students and faculty if cur-
rent students take it seriously, but it 
is equally important to recognize that 
students need to be incentivized to 
take course evaluations seriously.

What incentivizes students to legiti-

mately care about and be invested in 
course evaluations today? Currently, 
nothing tangible. What would incen-
tivize students to do so? Giving class 
time for students to fill them out or 
requiring students to fill out their 
course evaluations before they receive 
access to the data are two options. 
These are solutions that CSG is ready 
to support, but using statistically insig-
nificant decreases in student partici-
pation in course evaluations to argue 
against their release is disingenuous.

Moving forward, CSG President 

Cooper Charlton will be meeting with 
representatives of SACUA and Univer-
sity administrators to discuss our next 
steps regarding course evaluation data 
this week. At the meeting on Wednes-
day evening, we will maintain our 
commitment to the release of course 
evaluation data to the students of the 
University, signifying a return to the 
original purpose of course evalua-
tions. Additionally, we will call for the 
University to release the data to stu-
dents through academic advisors for 
the current course selection period, 
and for full access to the data by the 
selection period for the fall of 2016.

D

espite being a historically 
liberal institution, the Uni-
versity fails to include the pro-

hibition of political 
or intellectual dis-
crimination in its 
anti-discrimina-
tion policy. Across 
campus, the lack 
of 
institutional 

protection 
for 

unpopular opin-
ions 
— 
includ-

ing conservative 
views — can have 
a chilling effect on 
class 
discussion 

and student expression.

In all academic fields, discussion is 

critical to understanding the nuance 
of claims presented about the world. 
In some disciplines, like public policy 
— which strives to educate students 
not only on current policies but also 
on how to change them — understand-
ing multiple angles of divisive political 
issues and working with people who 
hold opposing viewpoints is essential.

Discussions in my Ford School 

of Public Policy classes regularly 
prompt dialogue on contentious 
political issues like minimum wage 
laws, detention of terror suspects and 
the far right’s influence in Congress. 
Here, disagreements are political, 
and discussions often reveal ideol-
ogy if students participate honestly. 
Group discussions can become more 
heated than average if one or two 
students disagree with the rest of 
their peers, and students may avoid 
expressing views that might conflict 
with the opinions they believe their 
professors hold.

Despite the opportunity for dis-

agreement, faculty members require 
students to participate in discussion, 
and give participation considerable 
weight toward final grades. Most Pub-
lic Policy professors who I have come 
into contact with have been ame-
nable to a diverse range of opinions. 
But, when students can’t be sure how 
accepting a professor will be, they may 
elect not to express their views at all.

Susan Collins, dean of the Ford, 

told me in an interview that most 
policy schools across the country tend 
to have greater liberal representation, 
and past surveys of Ford students 
show that relatively few self-identify 
as Republicans. Despite this, Collins 
believes that Ford students should be 
exposed to a wide range of viewpoints.

“I feel very strongly, and this is a 

view shared widely around the build-
ing,” Collins said, “that as a policy 
school, it’s really essential that people 
hear and understand and grapple with 

a range of perspectives, but in particu-
lar political perspectives.”

Even still, Collins said that stu-

dents have expressed to her their 
discomfort in expressing their views 
in class when they didn’t think any of 
their classmates shared them.

As a Republican in the Ford School, 

I can certainly relate to these students. 
One of my policy classes spends a 
considerable amount of time in small 
group discussions, where, in my expe-
riences, the majority of group mem-
bers have tended to share similar 
views on topics, and I’ve tended to dis-
agree. Sharing my opinion to a group 
of people who believe the opposite can 
be intimidating, and has been met, on 
occasion, with sarcastic, less-than-
flattering remarks.

I tend to be outgoing and outspo-

ken, and probably more willing than 
average to share my thoughts with 
those who might disagree. If I was 
afraid of sharing my opinions with 
liberals, I probably wouldn’t have 
identified myself as a Republican in 
the Daily so many times over the past 
two years. But when my peers don’t 
take my opinions seriously or make 
negative comments, it makes me 
think twice before choosing to par-
ticipate in class discussion again in 
the future. If I have occasionally felt 
too uncomfortable to share my opin-
ion in class, I can only imagine how 
my Republican peers might feel.

In most classes, faculty members 

seem to do their best to encourage dis-
senting opinions and highlight mul-
tiple sides of arguments. This isn’t just 
inclusive; it’s good pedagogy. To the 
extent that the Ford School aspires to 
produce effective public servants, it 
should strive to ensure its students can 
effectively communicate in institu-
tional environments with far greater 
intellectual diversity than the Public 
Policy school itself. It can’t do that if 
only one side of every issue is afforded 
serious consideration.

Despite expressed openness to 

ideas from all areas of the political 
spectrum, it’s clear that the school 
has a long way to go if it truly wants 
to become as tolerant of different ide-
ologies as it strives to be. A solid first 
step toward this goal doesn’t have to 
be Ford-specific: Adding political and 
intellectual discrimination to the Uni-
versity-wide nondiscrimination policy 
could go a long way to assure students 
their views will be respected.

Should the University continue to 

neglect this issue, the Public Policy 
School should draft an anti-discrim-
ination policy of its own that specifi-
cally prohibits discrimination based 
on political expression or ideology, 

and strengthens existing measures 
to promote an inclusive environment 
conducive to active, vocal participa-
tion from all students, regardless of 
background or identity.

But making the Ford School as 

diverse in political thought as the 
government bodies many Ford stu-
dents want to work in after gradua-
tion will require much more than a 
one-off policy change.

The Ford School should increase 

representation from political con-
servatives and Republicans. Better 
outreach to right-leaning student 
organizations will help students who 
don’t already have a network of Pub-
lic Policy students to tell them about 
the program or help them through 
the application process.

Even more importantly, the Pub-

lic Policy School needs to become a 
place that can credibly claim to pro-
spective students an acceptance of a 
wide range of viewpoints. This might 
include framing class discussions to 
highlight both sides of an argument, 
or assigning a paper in one of the 
required classes that asks students to 
argue a policy position they don’t sup-
port, prompting them to give serious 
consideration to an opposing point of 
view. It may also encourage faculty 
to avoid party-line generalizations 
that tempt students to think about 
Republicans and Democrats as being 
homogenous groups without ideologi-
cal variation, pitted against each other 
without room for compromise.

This isn’t to say that conserva-

tive students can’t find a place at 
the Ford School, or benefit from the 
excellent classes it offers. On the 
contrary, I think that students hold-
ing 
underrepresented 
ideologies 

have a unique role to play in making 
the Ford School even better than it 
already is. By creating an environ-
ment in which students challenge 
each other to develop best possible 
policy solutions, the Ford School can 
more effectively produce leaders who 
know how to work through the grid-
lock that plagues government today.

I doubt that this can happen 

in classes where the viewpoints 
expressed are frequently the same, 
either because there are too few stu-
dents who disagree, or because the 
ones who disagree don’t feel comfort-
able expressing their views. Progress 
on this issue will benefit not only cam-
pus conservatives but also the Public 
Policy School itself, by helping it pro-
vide a more comprehensive education 
for all of its students.

FROM THE DAILY

A 
 

solution to fix standardized testing practices has recently 
bubbled up. On Oct. 24, the Obama administration admitted 
it had pushed too far in holding state schools accountable 

based on their students’ standardized test scores. In light of this 
acknowledgment, the administration called on Congress to include 
specific measures that address the overemphasis on standardized 
testing in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act — a bill 
previously termed No Child Left Behind. Two different versions of the 
ESEA were reauthorized in July by both the House and the Senate, and 
the fate of the bill lies in the two chambers’ ability to compromise.

As part of Obama’s Testing Action Plan, 

which accompanied this announcement, by 
January 2016, the Department of Education 
will release a guidance plan for all states 
and districts detailing how to assess what 
standardized test practices will be fair, 
valid and efficient. These developments are 
especially compelling in the context of the 
disagreements surrounding the Michigan 
Student Test of Educational Progress, the 
new state-required standardized test that 
replaced the 44-year-old MEAP. The recently 
released and abysmally low M-STEP results 
indicate there are significant issues with 
the exam. To set Michigan students up for 
successful academic futures, the Michigan 
Legislature should use the results of this 
year’s M-STEP, combined with the guidelines 

set in the Testing Action Plan, to revise this 
new state-required test, and other state 
legislatures should follow suit.

Unlike 
the 
MEAP, 
the 
M-STEP 
is 

administered 
in 
the 
spring, 
which 
is 

advantageous to students because it tests 
them on material they just learned, rather 
than testing them on material they learned 
three months ago the previous spring. Another 
promising attribute is that the M-STEP aimed 
to incorporate Common Core standards by 
allowing schools to conduct the test online and 
including short-answer questions, in contrast 
to the MEAP, which only used multiple choice. 
These factors should have combined to create 
a “better” standardized test, but as Michigan 
students’ unbelievably low test scores reveal, 
this new test is very far from perfect.

In a phone interview with The Michigan 

Daily, 
Pamela 
Davis-Kean, 
professor 
of 

psychology and education at the University, 
said she takes the results with a grain of salt. 
Davis-Kean explained that by the time the 
federal government had made clear in 2014 the 
Common Core standards that state tests had 
to meet, there was little time for the state to 
actually create the new test. Also concerning 
is that M-STEP removed time restrictions on 
students taking the test. Most students took 
eight to 11 hours to complete the test, and some 
took even longer. This large range inherently 
causes unreliability in the data. 

“In general, no matter what the results are, 

they’re not going to be indicative of anything, 
because it wasn’t pretested — it didn’t go 
through the usual validations that most tests go 
through,” Davis-Kean said.

Guidelines explained in the Testing Action 

Plan could help solve some of the problems 
faced in creating and administering the 
M-STEP. The plan states $403 million would 
go toward creating state assessments that align 
with college and career-readiness standards. 
A separate $25 million will go to projects that 
help states develop new assessment models 
that would allow them to “address pressing 
needs they have identified for developing and 

implementing their assessments.” Now with 
the resources of both more time and more 
money, the Michigan Department of Education 
is better prepared to improve the state-required 
test than it was at the beginning of the 2014-15 
school year.

Calling for the state to place a cap on the 

amount of time districts and schools can spend 
testing, which the Testing Action Plan does, 
would discourage redundancy in the different 
tests schools are currently administering, 
and would therefore serve as a good first step 
toward greater efficiency. By limiting the 
time spent on standardized tests, the Obama 
administration will allow teachers to offer 
more content-based instruction that hones 
in on skills such as reading comprehension, 
critical thinking and rhetorical analysis. 

Rather than requiring students to spend an 
excessive number of hours taking a myriad 
of standardized tests, a returned emphasis 
on class content will give students a greater 
breadth of knowledge and skills than teaching 
to a standardized test allows. 

The plan makes several other much-needed 

calls to action aimed at state governments, 
local districts and individual schools. One 
important aspect of the Testing Action Plan is 
that it encourages states to release test results 
in a timely manner and to make clear to parents, 
students, teachers and administrators what 
these results can be used for. More timely 
access to statewide and individual results 
can help students and teachers make changes 
to curricula and individualized teaching 
strategies for specific student needs. 

In addition, the Testing Action Plan 

emphasizes flexibility in teacher preparation for 
these tests. The plan states, “as in other areas, 
we believe that student learning as measured 
by assessment results should be a part, not the 
sole determinant, of determining the quality of 
a particular program.” Instead of implying that 
educators should be “teaching to a test,” the 
plan seems to suggest that teacher performance 
should not be assessed solely based upon their 
students’ testing performance. After over a 
decade of overemphasizing the importance 
of student test scores in teacher evaluations, 
this is a refreshing and critical point for the 
government to concede.

Evaluating the results of the M-STEP 

demonstrate the Testing Action Plan is a long-
overdue call for states to not only place a cap on 
the amount of classroom time schools require 
of students, but also create a state-administered 
test that is more efficient and effective in 
measuring student achievement. The ideal test 
would encompass Common Core standards 
and would go through extensive preparatory 
procedures before being given to students as to 
avoid the mistakes of the M-STEP. Streamlined 
testing will produce useful data and allow for 
teachers to do what’s more important — focus 
on teaching content in the classroom.

FILM REVIEW
‘Spectre’ doesn’t 
live up to the hype

New Bond film falls 
short of spectacular 
previous installments

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

For The Daily

Despite the hype, “Spectre” 

falls short of being something 
spectacular. 
While 
not 
the 

worst of the recent Bond films, 
it definitely isn’t on the same 
level as “Casino 
Royale” 
and 

“Skyfall.”

In the 26th 

installment 
of 
the 
Bond 

series, a video 
message 
from 

the 
deceased 

M (Judi Dench, 
“The 
Vote”) 

leads Bond (Daniel Craig, “Sky-
fall”) on a mission to hunt and 
destroy the leader of Spectre, 
Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz, 
“Big Eyes”). Predictably, Bond 
must seek out a woman, the 
daughter of “Quantum of Sol-
ace” villain Mr. White (Jesper 
Christensen, “Ich und Kamin-
ski”), the easily irritable Made-
leine Swann (Léa Seydoux, “The 
Lobster”), to locate the enemy. 
While Bond frantically travels 
through Austria, the rest of his 
team faces a mole who is infil-
trating MI6’s headquarters.

Hoyte van Hoytema does an 

excellent job with the cinema-
tography; however, his efforts 
are not capable of saving the 
film from being a disappoint-
ment. The film’s editor executes 
the opening scene perfectly by 
synching the on screen imag-
es with the film’s theme, Sam 
Smith’s “Writing’s on the Wall.” 
Transitions from the Spectre’s 
octopus logo to shards of glass 
and snakes slithering around 
women’s bodies are seamless, 
instantly drawing the viewer 
into Bond’s world. As in the 
film itself, the extended track-
ing shots during the opening 
fight sequence in Mexico, sig-
nificantly elevate the action’s 
intensity. Using long lenses, 
makes it impossible to see what 
or who is coming into the frame, 
which leads to heightening both 
the intensity and the suspense-
ful mood. The helicopter and 
Aston Martin DB10 stunts are 
incredibly executed — the best 
stunt is when Bond grips the 
outside rail of the helicopter as 

it does a 360 in mid-air.

Craig excellently portrays 

Bond’s suave, seductive ways 
with his piercing blue eyes and 
sharp suits, while his stern 
facial expressions exude an 
alarming sense of confidence 
that only enhances Bond’s inde-
structibility. Of course, his mas-
sive muscles also add a degree 
of intimidation to Bond’s char-
acter — they’re even powerful 
enough to take down the freak-
ish Mr. Hinx (Dave Bautista, 
“TripTank”) However, without 
the help of Q (Ben Whishaw, 
“Cloud Atlas”), he would be 
a significantly less efficient 
agent. Q, whose name certain-
ly stands for quirky, provides 
interesting depth to the movie 
with his sharp contrast to Bond, 
and the two have an almost 
brotherly relationship. Unfor-
tunately, Q’s role in the film is 
very limited, so his ability to 
truly enhance the film is irrel-
evant.

While Bond’s MI6 team-

mates strengthen the film, 
his enemies do not. Although 
they both clearly hate Bond, 
it’s hard to believe that either 
is actually evil. Oberhauser’s 
“villain creds” are quickly 
diminished by his display of 
affection for a fluffy white 
persian cat, not to mention the 
lackluster dialogue that makes 
him seem anything but menac-
ing. Instead of being brashly 
threatening, the conversations 
between Bond, his team, the 
two villains feels inappropri-
ately colloquial, much like the 
typical dialect of spiteful sib-
lings and not that of hostile 
adversaries.

Bond’s newest love doesn’t 

fare much better as far as cred-
ibility goes. Other than the fact 

that she can put a bullet through 
someone’s head, Swann is just 
like every other girl who has 
crossed Bond’s path — foreign, 
promiscuous and moody. It’s 
hard to believe Swann is a psy-
chologist given the degree to 
which Swann struggles with 
maintaining 
her 
emotional 

composure. Her constant whin-
ing and false-sounding griev-
ing is painful to both watch and 
hear.

A majority of the movie is a 

reference to past films instead 
of developing a new storyline: 
essentially, “Spectre” feels more 
like a tribute than an entirely 
new film. Bond wears a mask 
during the Day of the Dead cel-
ebration in Mexico, which mim-
ics Baron Samedi’s skull mask in 
“Live and Let Die.” Bond’s ask-
ing for his dirty martini to be 
shaken, not stirred refers back 
to the classic line in “Dr. No.” 
For the final tribute hurrah, an 
entire wall inside the old MI6 
building is lined with posters of 
all Bond’s previous villains and 
deceased lovers, which Bond 
suddenly stops to view even 
though he’s running out of time 
to make it out alive. These refer-
ences might enhance the expe-
rience for a Bond fanatic, but 
they exist for the sole purpose 
of being cutesy, and do not add 
much to the film overall.

Unfortunately, what made 

past Bond films so incredible 
can’t effectively be recreated, 
and definitely can’t be thrown 
together in order to form 
another movie. Had it been 
focused on continuing Bond’s 
adventure from where it left off 
at the end of “Skyfall,” “Spec-
tre” could have been another 
critical success in this new era 
of Bond.

‘Shitty Boyfriends’ 
won’t fill your gaps

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

Misery loves company, and 

there’s no better way for women 
to commiserate together than 
gossip 
about 

the 
losers 

they’ve dated. 
“Shitty 
Boy-

friends,” 
an 

original 
web 

series 
from 

executive 
producers 
Lisa 
Kudrow 

(“Friends”) 
and Dan Bucatinsky (“Scandal”), 
proves yet again how fictional 
the perfect guys in rom-coms 
are. Released on Refinery29, an 
online news and fashion out-
let, the comedic show strikes a 
chord when you’re feeling par-
ticularly screwed over by men, 
but ‘Boyfriends’ won’t hold your 
attention for long in comparison 
to other more compelling con-
tent online.

Amanda 
(Melissa 
Hunter, 

“Adult Wednesday”) is an up-
and-coming cartoon artist on the 
hunt for The One. In each seven-
minute 
episode 
installment, 

Amanda finds herself involved 
with 
yet 
another 
deadbeat. 

While her exaggerated dating 
faux pas are comical, the stilted 
acting draws a noticeable divide 
between the show and reality. 
Desperately trying to abandon 
her single status, Amanda looks 
for love in the most obscure 
prospects that inevitably fulfill 
the show’s title. From one epi-
sode to another, Amanda leaves 
her romances without any dis-
tinct lessons learned (unless the 
moral is to immediately ditch 

the guy who gifts her a sample 
size Bath & Body Works spray 
for Valentine’s Day). Unfor-
tunately, “Shitty Boyfriends” 
focuses more on ridiculing men 
than it does developing the hero-
ine’s character as a strong, inde-
pendent woman. 

The series features Sandra 

Oh (“Grey’s Anatomy”), who 
slips naturally into the role of 
the remorseless boss with a 
killer fashion sense. Though Oh 
only appears in three of the five 
released episodes, her striking 
presence leaves the audience 
begging for more screentime. 
It seems there is more curiosity 
surrounding her love life than 
Amanda’s.

The show fully elucidates 

the ludicrous archetypes of 
men in the 21st century, por-
trayed 
through 
the 
terrible 

men Amanda dates. The self-
proclaimed happy vegan turns 
“free-gan” as he starts rummag-
ing through garbage bins for 
food, and the guy who says they 
should get married after the first 

date is, not surprisingly, crazy. 
But, though the tortured film 
enthusiast who enjoys watching 
“Schindler’s List” to wind down 
warrants a chuckle, “Shitty Boy-
friends” is just not memorable. 
With entertainment powerhous-
es like Kudrow and Bucatinsky 
as producers, the show carries a 
burden of expectation for side-
splitting comical punches left 
and right, instead of awkward 
cringe-worthy scenarios.

Refinery29’s content focuses 

on fashion and lifestyle, and the 
series is another outlet to show-
case quirky style through the 
costumes. Sporting loud prints 
and colors, the characters’ ward-
robe tells a story of its own. In 
this respect, “Shitty Boyfriends” 
naturally fits into the site. But 
ultimately, it’s clear that the web 
series is not destined to become 
the Internet’s next hit-sensa-
tion. The episodes may tempo-
rarily cheer you up after a lousy 
date, but they won’t be enough 
to keep you from drowning your 
sorrows in ice cream.

“Flesh and Bone” is the new 

limited series from Starz about 
the gritty underbelly of the New 
York City bal-
let. If that sen-
tence 
makes 

you giggle a 
bit because it 
has both the 
words “ballet” 
and 
“gritty” 

in it, well, that 
seems to kind 
of be the point. 
The 
series 

comes from the 
mind of Moira Walley-Beckett, 
the master behind some of the 
best episodes in “Breaking Bad,” 
including the nerve-shattering 
“Ozymandias.” Like her previous 
series, “Flesh and Bone” seeks to 
destroy the disparity between 
the sacred and of the profane. 
Many have already grown skep-
tical about the show, going so far 
as to compare it to the reviled 
“Showgirls.” Yet, while the series 
does fill the screen with beauti-
ful people engaged in exploitative 
and overly-sexualized activities, 
“Flesh and Bone” seems use tropes 
of premium-cable dramas to say 
something not only relevant to the 
world it creates, but to the greater 
landscape — and intersections 
between — contemporary art and 
entertainment.

The show follows Claire (Sarah 

Hay, “Black Swan”) as she runs 
away from her troubled home in 
Pittsburgh to become a ballerina 
in the prestigious American Bal-
let Company. The leader of the 
company is Paul (Ben Daniels, 
“Locke”), a sociopathic artistic 
director who believes his dancers 
are his property. Though many 
might compare the character to 
Vincent 
Cassel’s 
sex-obsessed 

director from “Black Swan,” Dan-
iels seems more concerned with 
maintaining his power rather than 
just sleeping with his dancers. 
Daniels is an intimidating force 
in the pilot, even if the character 
might be one we’ve seen else-
where, whether in “Black Swan” 
or “Whiplash.” Unfortunately, it’s 

a character whose reality never 
stretches beyond the veil of believ-
ability. There really are people out 
there — whether in film, music, 
theatre or journalism — who do 
sink this low, while relishing their 
unchecked authority over those 
who are vulnerable.

With the same gothic sensi-

bility Walley-Beckett brought to 
“Breaking Bad,” the repressively 
polite world of ballet is ironically 
juxtaposed with the sordid under-
belly of exotic dancing. This aspect 
of “Flesh and Bone” — along with 
its pervasive use of nudity and 
sexuality — might draw the series 
its most criticism. Yet what sepa-
rates “Flesh and Bone” from other 
premium-cable dramas is that the 
nudity has a purpose connected 
to the overarching themes of the 
show. “Flesh and Bone” is very 
much about the male gaze and 
the physical, emotional and psy-
chological punishment it inflicts 
on those caught in its sight. In 
his world, director Paul is god, 
and all must shape themselves 
according to his vision.

In a manner, the show feels 

like an apt companion piece 
to the Cinemax original series 
“The Knick,” giving us the sordid 
details allowed by premium cable 
— whether that be the gore in 
“The Knick” or the sex in “Flesh 
and Bone” — but just in a subver-
sive context.

The ballet, in a fashion, can 

be looked at like premium-
cable, itself: an environment in 
which the wealthy and power-
ful indulge their baser instincts 
under the guise of sophisticated 

cultural engagement. After all, 
premium cable might have given 
the world “The Sopranos” and 
“The Wire,” but it’s also been the 
home of “Max After Dark.”

Whether 
or 
not, 
Walley-

Beckett is intentionally playing 
around with premium cable’s 
reputation for both cutting-edge 
art and deliberate exploitation 
remains to be seen, as the show 
has yet to achieve the same 
nuance as “Masters of Sex.” 
However, Walley-Beckett suc-
ceeds by providing the viewer 
with an almost voyeuristic frame 
in which to pull back the curtain 
on a seemingly high-brow form 
of art.

Neither the world of strippers 

and gangsters nor that of the bal-
let is necessarily appealing to 
Claire and, like “Breaking Bad,” 
Walley-Beckett 
intelligently 

negates the notion of a high and 
low path. In both worlds, the 
characters are thrown to the 
dogs; the only choice they really 
have is which pit they’re more 
comfortable being devoured in.

There are many who have 

already criticized the show, and 
not without reason. Some of its 
characters become cliché (the 
dominating dance teacher, the 
street smart fellow dancer, the 
prudish main character); however, 
in the hands of Walley-Beckett 
and director David Michod (“Ani-
mal Kingdom”), the pilot manages 
to transcend its lesser qualities to 
deliver a perverse, entertaining 
hour of television, and hopefully 
only the first entry in Walley-Beck-
ett’s oeuvre of original dramas.

FILM NOTEBOOK
Crowdfunded ‘Fury’

By ANA LUCENA

For The Daily

As an aspiring filmmaker, I 

was excited when I saw friends 
post on Facebook and Instagram 
about an incredible short film 
titled “Kung Fury” that is free 
to watch on YouTube. Since I 
don’t particularly like kung fu 
films more than any other genre, 
I was hesitant to believe the 
hype at first. But its wild success 
inspired me, not only because 
you can finally reach a wider 
audience to appreciate your 
work, but also because it shows 
that anyone who believes in 
their craft finally has a platform 
where they can make it big.

“Kung Fury” is a brilliant 

homage to the cinema of the 
1980s — especially kung fu and 
cop films — and illustrates the 
maximum potential filmmakers 
have in the digital age. The proj-
ect was crowdfunded through 
Kickstarter and raised more 
than $600,000 in funds, which, 
while short of the $1 million 
needed for a feature-length film, 
exceeded the $200,000 origi-
nally asked for. This garnered 
the short film a lot of atten-
tion, including this year’s Lovie 
Internet Video Person of the 
Year Award for director David 
Sandberg for his spectacular use 
of netizens’s support in getting 
his short film completed and 

released on YouTube and Netf-
lix for free. This is in addition to 
the positive reviews critics gave 
“Kung Fury.” The way the proj-
ect was funded is a stark change 
from the difficult, traditional way 
to fund films, which changed my 
view of the profession after won-
dering how I would solve such a 
problem.

My biggest concern in becom-

ing a filmmaker is funding. 
Patiently infiltrating Hollywood 
over several years seems to be the 
most common technique used, 
but that means that I would have 
to wait a long time before I could 
quit my day job. You can’t pre-
dict what the public will enjoy, 
which leads to producers play-
ing it safe when they decide what 
projects to pursue. This difficulty 
to finance films has led to main-
stream cinema producing the 
same old movies that follow the 
same old tropes no matter how 
devoid of originality or creativ-
ity or taste they are (I’m looking 
at you, Michael Bay!). This makes 
sense, considering film produc-
tion is an expensive and con-
suming effort. After writing and 
rewriting your script, you have to 
gather actors, props and people 
who know how to handle camer-
as, lights, costumes and makeup 
before you can even begin to edit 
and add special effects. Funding 
a film the way Sandberg did was 
unimaginable before the wide-

spread use of the Internet.

A case in point is the 1994 

classic 
“Clerks” 
by 
director, 

screenwriter and producer Kevin 
Smith. The philosophical com-
edy was solely funded by Smith, 
including maxing out multiple 
credit cards and dipping into 
his college fund. Even then, he 
was forced to film at the conve-
nience store he worked at when 
it was closed, and had to get his 
family and friends to act in the 
movie in order for his budget to 
make ends meet. Fortunately for 
him, Smith’s deep investment 
in his craft paid off, winning 
several awards at the Sundance 
Screen Festival and the Cannes 
Film Festival and leading to the 
creation of the “View Askewni-
verse” franchise. Yet, Smith’s 
experience remains a rare one. 
The same can’t be said by all film-
makers struggling to get their 
vision seen.

Though “Kung Fury” ’s suc-

cess from crowdfunding doesn’t 
change the fact that making it 
big in the film industry is easier 
said than done, I expect that 
more people will be able to share 
their cinematic art this way and 
improve entertainment for all. 
And if this pushes movie studios 
to compete with the web’s access 
to such raw talent, and in turn 
makes them raise the standard of 
today’s mainstream movies, I’m 
all for it.

TV NOTEBOOK
‘Teresa’ exploits 
family struggles

Giudice legal 

problems explored 

in ‘Housewives’ 

spin-off

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

Whether 
from 
shock, 
or 

pure interest, I could not peel 
my eyes away from 14-year-old 
Gia Giudice’s heavily made-up 
face as she was interviewed on 
the latest episode of the three-
part series “Teresa Checks In.” 
The eldest of four daughters to 
Teresa and Joe Giudice — who 
were recently sentenced to jail 
for bankruptcy fraud — is put 
in the spotlight alongside her 
father and siblings in lieu of her 
mother, who has only contrib-
uted to the show through phone 
calls. In a thinly veiled effort to 
exploit this, has Bravo officially 
crossed the boundaries of real-
ity television? Or has this been 
a long time coming for the Giu-
dices?

“The Real Housewives of New 

Jersey” has followed the Giudice 
family, in addition to the family’s 
multiple other cast mates for the 
last five years — digging deep into 
their personal lives, extravagant 
lifestyle, ludicrous spending hab-
its and most of all, family drama. 
Though much of this content is 
edited and even scripted by the 
show’s producers, the couple’s 
legal issues began long before 
the show. Manipulating these 
circumstances to make for more 
emotional television would have 
been just plain tacky. Yet, as with 
the show’s nature, the “House-
wives” franchise has become 
successful doing just that – using 
emotional situations to entertain 
audiences and create TV perso-
nas with large fan bases. “Teresa 
Checks In” is just a test of her fan 
base, whose support she needs 
now more than ever.

What’s especially ironic is that 

the very show that put the spot-

light on the Giudices during their 
grapple with their legal issues, is 
now the primary media source 
redeeming them from their 
negative public image. Accord-
ing to Joe, “being in the public 
didn’t help,” yet it is being in the 
public eye that propelled Tere-
sa’s cookbooks, haircare line 
and other businesses, garnering 
millions of fans. However, these 
fans seem to be lacking with the 
recent premiere of the show, 
which follows the family during 
Teresa’s absence. Just 1.2 mil-
lion viewers tuned in to the first 
episode. Teresa’s attempt to sal-
vage her fame and regenerate 
her and Joe’s lost fortune over-
estimates the loyalty fans have 
to the superficial figures cre-
ated through Bravo’s depraved 
formula for reality television.

This 
formula 
(essentially, 

wealth + scripted television = 
exorbitant antics) is the source 
of success behind various other 
shows that draw millions of 
viewers, such as those who 
follow the “Real Housewives” 
series. “Keeping Up with the 
Kardashians” is one such exam-
ple. Most of the show’s 18 to 
34-year-old audience, including 
myself, have been keeping up 
with the family since the show’s 
early 
episodes, 
which 
pre-

miered in 2007. As the audience 
has aged, so has the show’s cast, 
making it feel as though they 
are a part of the family’s lives. 
We’ve accepted two divorces, 
three kids, a few lip injections 
and a gender transition as much 
a part of our lives as theirs. The 
reality on screen has become 
our own — online, in newspa-
pers and magazines, in books 
and so on. It’s even second 
nature for us to refer to them as 
if we know them personally.

As far as this goes for Tere-

sa, her fame — which shed an 
undesirable spotlight on her 
and her husband’s financial 
indiscretions — has had reper-
cussions not only on her and 
her family, but also on viewers 
everywhere. When a convicted 

white collar criminal contin-
ues to receive fame and money 
after being held responsible for 
their actions, it sends a perplex-
ing message to the millions of 
people who observe this. Once 
sentenced, most criminals do 
not have the luxury of mending 
their public image and making 
money by means of carefully 
composed 
reality 
television. 

In fact, this got Teresa into 
some trouble, when she asked 
her daughter Gia to tweet on 
her behalf and thank her fans 
for their “support.” Given her 
experiences, Teresa may have 
been knocked down a notch or 
two, but she doesn’t seem to 
fully grasp the extent to which 
she must take responsibility 
for her actions. And her fans 
seem to agree. Though “Teresa 
Checks In” presents only a sliv-
er of her current reality, it is a 
shoddy attempt at reshaping the 
family’s image and extorting 
whatever publicity it can from 
the remains of Teresa’s Bravo 
legacy.

The problem with reality 

TV, simply put, is that it’s not 
real. Whatever the content, it’s 
a means by which to distort 
perception. Whether it’s paint-
ing the Giudice family as well-
meaning people who are truly 
remorseful for taking advantage 
of the system to fend off their 
growing debt, or the wealth-
fueled antics of the Botox-lad-
en Kardashian clan — reality 
programming shapes its view-
ers’ ideas of right and wrong 
— what is desirable and what 
isn’t and what the appropriate 
responses are to inaccurately 
fabricated situations. When it 
comes to cases as ubiquitous 
as “The Real Housewives,” the 
monstrous public figures they 
have shaped out of affluence and 
scripted antics wield an alarm-
ing amount of power over view-
ers. The consequences of this 
power: a representation of real-
ity so misconceived that the very 
notion of what is acceptable and 
what is not has become skewed.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Hey, it’s Millennials 
and we love Disney

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

Daily Arts Writer

This 
week, 
Daily 
Music 

Writers are looking back on the 
first albums they ever loved. 
Today, 
Danielle 
Immerman 

remembers 
Disney 
Channel 

greats. 

I don’t believe in favoritism. I 

can barely decide which cookie 
I want at Insomnia, so please 
don’t ask me to decide what my 
first favorite album was. Also, 
asking a music lover what her 
first favorite album was is kind 
of like asking Donald Trump 
what his imperfections are — 
you won’t get an answer.

Seeing that I don’t believe in 

favoritism, I decided to ask all 
four of my friends here at the 
University of Michigan what 
tickled their fancies early on in 
life.

My 
dear 
friend 
Mallory 

Robbins, 
an 
LSA 
freshman 

and proud srat sister of Alpha 
Delta Pi, proclaimed that the 
2006 hit Hannah Montana is 
the first album she fell in love 
with. According to my Mal pal, 
“Hannah Montana is my idol 
— she’s amazing and really had 
the best of both worlds. Her 
wig was phenomenal and just 
changed my life.” Too true, Mal. 
Hannah Montana did indeed 
change all of our lives.

LSA freshman Natalie Gray, a 

salty resident of Bursley and the 
most exuberant member of the 
Delta Phi Epsilon sisterhood, 
took me for a walk down 
memory lane. Hilary Duff’s 

Metamorphosis is her first fave 
album. Nat Gray backs up this 
confession by saying Duff “was 
a real day one that spoke true 
words.” Well, Nat Gray, if we’re 
being completely transparent 
here, I would probably have to 
agree with you.

Emily 
Cornelius, 
another 

LSA freshman (because those 
are the only people willing to 
talk to me), divulged that her 
first love is none other than Mr. 
Lupe Fiasco. Lasers is number 
one on E Corn’s list because 
back when she was a youngster, 
“Lupe just really got me.” (Fun 
fact, when I pronounced Lupe 
wrong, Mal Pal bitched me 
out by saying “Jesus, Dan, you 
can’t pronounce it like that; it’s 
disrespectful to Mr. Fiasco.”)

LSA 
freshman 
Catherine 

Karns, a fellow Donald Trump 
hater, can’t seem to shake the 
memory of The Cheetah Girls 
from her mind. Cat watched 

them 
open 
for 
Hannah 

Montana back in the day and 
elaborated profusely about this 
experience by saying “it was 
lit.” I asked Cat why she loves 
The Cheetah Girls so much and 
she responded, “I honestly don’t 
know. They were just boss-ass 
bitches before I even knew what 
that meant.” Truth, Cat, truth.

As you can see by this 

massive survey I conducted, 
there is very little variation in 
millenials first favorite albums. 
Basically, if it wasn’t on the 
Disney Channel, I doubt any of 
us would dub it our favorite first 
album (unless you actually knew 
what shitty music sounded like 
when you were eight years old). 
In conclusion, I would like to 
thank my gaggle of friends for 
taking thirty seconds of your 
life to answer my pivotal earth-
shattering questions. You are all 
true day-ones, but Hilary Duff 
is still better than you.

CONCERT REVIEW
Halloween at The 
Ark with Wild Child

By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR

Daily Arts Writer

I hadn’t heard a lot of Wild 

Child before Saturday. But one 
look at the audience, and I knew 
exactly where I was. There was 
a comfort, a cheerful warmth 
at 
The 
Ark, 
Ann 
Arbor’s 

staple folk venue, on Saturday 
night. What started as sweet 
serendipity 
quickly 
turned 

into one of the best indie folk 
experiences of my life.

Clad in Halloween costumes 

ranging from simple mustaches 
to the “Ann” of Ann Arbor, 
the Austin-based, seven-piece 
band wove every sad story on 
their discography into a saga of 
forgiving and moving on.

“Victim to Charm,” from 

Wild 
Child’s 
2011 
release 

The Runaways, harmoniously 
blended vocalists Kelsey Wil-
son and Alexander Beggins 
with a powerful mix of vio-
lin and cello. In seconds, the 
venue was glued to every word. 
The strings echoed just long 
enough after every verse ended 
to keep everyone feeling privy 
to the magic shared on The 
Ark stage. “Break Bones,” from 
Fools, the group’s latest album, 
darkening lyrics were almost 
inappropriately masked in an 
infectious piano-backed melo-
dy, which made me take until 
the end of the song to question 
how I was feeling.

It didn’t take long for the 

entire venue to catch on to 
the familial joy being thrown 
around stage. For “Cocaine 
Hurricane,” not a single person 
shied away from trying to 
catch all the childish syllables 
of the song in a single breath. 
As “Crazy Bird” ‘s familiar 
introductory riff hit cellist 
Sadie Wolfe’s bass strings, the 
crowd was visibly awakened. 

Lead vocalist Kelsey Wilson 

has the ability to bring peace to 
sadness and weave melancholia 
into just another memory. The 
rather 
unusual 
harmonies 

between ukulele, cello and 
violin — held together by 
Wilson’s salient vocal — spread 
to every corner of the Ark, 
making it impossible to not 
share joy with every other fan 
in the sold-out venue.

“You feel like you’re together 

in something — like you’re 
experiencing the whole thing 
together. It’s a family therapy 
with a lot of dancing,” Wilson 
said of her music on the band’s 
website.

Therapy is right. Two hours 

later, I felt refreshed. Maybe, 
I felt, this is what music was 
created to be. An outlet for all 
the weight we feel on a day-to-
day basis. A place where secrets 
become just another story, and 
struggles become something to 
be cherished and learned from.

Penalty still irks Harbaugh

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Two days had passed since 

the Michigan football team’s 
dismantling of Rutgers, and Jim 
Harbaugh still wasn’t quite over 
the game. Earlier in the season, 
Harbaugh emphasized that he 
generally takes just a few hours 
to enjoy a victory. After that, his 
focus turns to the next game.

That mantra clearly doesn’t 

apply when Harbaugh is upset 
about 
something 
from 
the 

previous game. In his weekly 
press 
conference 
Monday, 

Harbaugh explained that he 
was still “offended” by the 
unsportsmanlike penalty call 
on his team late in the first half 
Saturday, when junior tight 
end Jake Butt made a 51-yard 
reception 
down 
Michigan’s 

sideline, only to be called back 
because the referees ruled that 
the play was intended to deceive 
the opponent.

Harbaugh insisted after the 

game that the Wolverines were 
not trying to deceive the Scarlet 
Knights. In Harbaugh’s version 
of the story, Butt was simply 
going to line up out wide. The 
fact that he trailed other players 
who were going to the sidelines 
was irrelevant.

Harbaugh did not change his 

tune Monday, discussing his 
disappointment with some of the 
calls made against his team at 
length, much of it unprovoked. 
He 
did 
not 
particularly 

understand the nature of the 
penalty that was called against 
this team.

“I 
take 
the 
rules 
very 

seriously, 
understanding 
the 

rules, 
understanding 
the 

consistency, the clarity of the 
rules,” Harbaugh said. “Not just 
the rules, but the spirit of the 
rules, and doing everything that 
we can to follow the rules.”

Harbaugh said he would like 

specifics so that he can show 
his team the proper protocol 
for substitutions, and ensure a 
similar incident doesn’t happen 
again. He also said he would 
like to know what else could be 
considered deception. What if, 
Harbaugh asked, a team decided 
to throw a backward pass into 
the dirt, only to have a player 
pick it up and throw it? Would 
that, too, be deception if the 
defense stopped playing?

The part that seemed to 

offend Harbaugh most, though, 
was not that his team was 
accused of attempting to deceive 
the opponent. It was that the 
Wolverines were accused of 
being unsportsmanlike.

Harbaugh, by nature, doesn’t 

always seem like a coach obsessed 
with sportsmanship. Sideline 
tirades 
are 
not 
uncommon, 

and videos have captured him 
hollering expletives at referees.

Still, he frequently preaches 

sportsmanship 
to 
his 
team. 

His players have had standing 
orders all season to refrain from 
trash talking and showboating. 
Redshirt 
freshman 
safety 

Jabrill Peppers was worried that 
Harbaugh was going to yell at 
him for strutting into the end 
zone Saturday on his second-
quarter touchdown run. 

“I take my sportsmanship 

very 
seriously,” 
Harbaugh 

said. “(You) want to do it at the 
highest level, and you also want 
to be able to talk to your players 
about what the rules are to give 
them clarity.”

Michigan’s players preferred 

to let Harbaugh sort out any 
qualms about officiating and 
interpretation of rules.

“Players play, coaches coach, 

officials officiate, so we just do 
our part,” said junior defensive 
end Taco Charlton.

Michigan senior linebacker 

Joe Bolden, who was ejected 
from 
the 
Wolverines’ 
game 

against Michigan State in a call 
that also bothered Harbaugh, 
offered a similar perspective. 
Playing football is his task, not 
worrying about officiating.

Harbaugh said Monday that 

he did not want his focus to be on 
the officials, professing respect 
for what he considers a difficult 
job. His ire instead falls upon the 
rules themselves.

The intent to deceive call 

was not the only rule that 
offended Harbaugh. He used 
the same expression to describe 
his feelings about the lack of 
a penalty on a punt return 
from Saturday’s game, when 
Michigan redshirt sophomore 
long snapper Scott Sypniewski 
was upended by a hit to his upper 
body. The play was reviewed for 

targeting, but no penalty was 
called after the targeting call 
was overturned. Targeting calls 
have mystified Michigan this 
season, and Saturday’s was just 
the latest example. Charlton 
said referees came to one of the 
Wolverines’ 
practices 
earlier 

this season, but even that did not 
clear up the ambiguity.

“A player looks like he made 

a decision to hit him, hit him 
high, hit him in the back,” 
Harbaugh said. “At least should 
be a block in the back. Should 
be unsportsmanlike for making 
that play, so I’m offended for our 
defenseless player, so you can 
put that on the list of things.”

It is worth a reminder that 

Michigan won Saturday’s game, 
49-16.

MEN’S TENNIS
Crocker wins six 
straight for title

By COLE ZINGAS

For the Daily

The Michigan men’s tennis 

team traveled to Iowa City this 
weekend for the Big Ten Singles 
Championship, which ran from 
Friday to Monday, and one 
player stole the show.

Monday, redshirt sophomore 

Davis Crocker took home the 
title in a highly talented field, 
and did so in dominant fashion. 
Crocker dropped only one set 
during his six-match streak to 
win the tournament.

According 
to 
Michigan 

associate 
head 
coach 
Sean 

Maymi, 
Crocker’s first 
tournament 
title 
is 
a 

testament 
to 

his hard work.

“He’s 

probably 
the 
hardest-

working 
guy 

we 
have,” 

Maymi 
said. 

“It’s 
not 
a 

surprise that the results are 
starting to come for him.”

Crocker ran through the 

64-player field in three days, first 
taking care of opponents from 
Wisconsin, Illinois, Nebraska 
and Penn State. Crocker then 
defeated 
Northwestern’s 

Ben 
Vandixhorn, 
who 
took 

down 
Crocker’s 
teammate, 

junior Kevin Wong, in the 
quarterfinals. 

That landed Crocker a spot 

in the final against Nebraska’s 
Toby Boyer. Crocker went down 
3-0 in the first set, but won the 
next six games to take the set 
before dominating the second 
set, 6-2, to finish the job. 

Crocker’s determination has 

led him to a good start to the 
year thus far, and his coaches 
hope 
the 
improvement 
can 

continue.

“I 
think 
the 
difference 

between last year and this year 
is him playing a consistent 
gamestyle that he’s buying into, 
which creates a lot of problems 
for his opponents,” Maymi said.

Crocker led the charge for 

a group of Wolverines who all 
had some positive moments in 
the tournament. Along with 
Crocker, Wong and freshman 
Lubomir Cuba made the Round 
of 16, but only Wong joined 
Crocker in the quarterfinals. 

Maymi said 

that he saw a 
great deal of 
improvement 
out of Wong 
and Cuba this 
weekend, 
and also saw 
promising 
results 
from 

junior 
Tyler 

Gardiner, who 
lost a tough 

three-setter in the first round. 

Michigan 
had 
a 
split 

squad 
this 
weekend, 
with 

the remainder of the team 
traveling to the USTA Collegiate 
Clay 
Court 
Invitational 
in 

Orlando, Fla., but none of those 
Wolverines advanced past the 
quarterfinals.

Going into the final week of 

the fall season, Crocker’s victory 
gives a boost to the entire team, 
which will compete at the 
Lakewood Ranch Invitational in 
Sarasota, Fla., this weekend.

“For him to come out and beat 

some of the best players in the 
Big Ten is a positive thing for us,” 
Maymi said. “The whole team 
gains confidence from this.”

“He’s probably 

the hardest-
working guy 

we have.”

‘M’ embraces opportunity

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

When then-No. 7 Michigan 

State fell to Nebraska on a last-
minute touchdown, Michigan 
fans cheered. Sure, having the 
Wolverines’ in-state rival lose 
is exciting, but the loss brings a 
new level of excitement to Ann 
Arbor.

Now, if Michigan and Ohio 

State both win their next two 
games, the Nov. 28 installment 
of “The Game” will have more 
on the line than bragging rights: 
The winner will earn a berth in 
the Big Ten Championship. 

“I’m sure they’re aware of 

that,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “If not, we’ll make 
them aware of it. I’m sure they 
are.”

At 
7-2, 
the 
15th-ranked 

Wolverines sit tied for second 
in the Big Ten East. The team 
tied with them, Michigan State, 
would beat them in the head-to-
head tiebreaker, but the Spartans 
still have to travel to Columbus 
and must win to stay alive.

If they lose, Michigan gets 

new life.

“It would mean a tremendous 

amount,” said junior defensive 
end 
Taco 
Charlton. 
“We 

came here to win a Big Ten 
championship 
and 
hopefully 

win a national championship, so 
the fact that we’re going in that 
direction, things are getting that 
way, that it can still happen … 
that’s what we want.”

To 
get 
there, 
though, 

Michigan has to do its part by 
beating Indiana and Penn State 
on the road. But if the Wolverines 
did, they would have a chance 
to win their first Big Ten title 
in 11 years, likely playing No. 
7 Iowa for a berth in the Rose 
Bowl. The statistics website 
FiveThirtyEight.com has given 
Michigan a 13-percent chance of 
winning the Big Ten, an eight-
percent chance of making the 
College Football Playoff and a 
one-percent chance of winning 
the National Championship.

But until further notice, that’s 

all a pipe dream. Players and 
coaches have been adamant that 
the focus this week is on Indiana, 
despite the Hoosiers’ five-game 
losing streak. The Wolverines 
will be favored in both games 
but are sticking to the one-
game-at-a-time approach that 
has worked so far.

“Guys know, and they know 

what needs to happen for us to 
get to the championship,” said 
senior linebacker Joe Bolden. 
“Most of our guys are smart 
enough to figure it out, but Coach 
Harbaugh, it’s black and white 

with him. He’ll let you know if 
you’re in the race or not.”

To be in the race, however, 

Michigan will need Ohio State 
to beat Michigan State. The 
Buckeyes would enter the game 
undefeated, but a Wolverine win 
would give them a head-to-head 
tiebreaker.

That creates a moral dilemma 

for the Wolverines, who were 
trained by fans, coaches and 
family alike to root against Ohio 
State.

“Rooting for Ohio State is 

a very bad, I would say, not a 
very good phrase,” Bolden said. 
“Obviously, we want to get to 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Championship, 

and for them to win that game 
(against MSU) here in a couple 
weeks would be awesome, but 
at the same time, I don’t really 
care what happens there. All we 
care about is Saturday. We can’t 
get there without continuously 
winning.”

But as the weeks wear on 

and Michigan keeps winning, 
the possibility of a Big Ten 
championship berth remains, 
and “The Game” can gain a 
whole new meaning.

“It’d be interesting,” Bolden 

said. “It’d be very interesting 
and a heck of a day. That last 
Saturday of November would be 
a heck of a day.”

ICE HOCKEY
Inconsistency leaves 
goalie spot available

Ex-forward Larkin 

back in town to 
watch practice

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

One of the biggest issues the 

Michigan hockey team faces as 
it prepares for Friday’s matchup 
with Niagara is 
its goaltending. 
The 
problem 

has carried over from the 2014 
campaign, and it appears there 
is still no easy solution.

In the Wolverines’ matchup 

with Union on Oct. 23, senior 
goaltender Steve Racine made 
a 
sprawling 
stick-side 
save, 

extending the entire length of 
the net to keep Michigan (4-1-1) 
from conceding a goal early.

Yet 
after 
his 
display 
of 

excellent 
netminding, 
the 

veteran went on to allow five 
goals.

The following day against 

Rensselaer 
Polytechnic 

Institute, 
junior 
Zach 

Nagelvoort went in between the 
pipes and allowed just two goals 
— an improvement over Racine, 
considering one goal was simply 
a well-orchestrated play from 
the Engineers.

Nagelvoort went on to start 

against Robert Morris, when he 
allowed three goals but stopped 
a flurry of shots in the final two 
minutes of the third period to 
bolster a 5-3 Wolverine victory.

But then he, too, fell prey to 

inconsistency. In the second 
game of the series against the 
Colonials, Nagelvoort allowed 
three goals in the first period, 
Racine replaced him.

Both 
goaltenders 
have 

struggled to replicate those strong 
performances, showing flashes of 
brilliance before faltering and 
conceding weak goals.

Then 
there 
is 
freshman 

Chad Catt, the mystery man of 

Michigan’s 
goaltending 
trio. 

Fans have gained only a glimpse 
of Catt, who played one period in 
an exhibition against Toronto on 
Oct. 4.

At this point, Michigan coach 

Red Berenson has indicated that 
the starting job is open to all 
three candidates.

“(The starting spot) is open 

for whoever takes advantage of 
their chance,” Berenson said. 
“That’s the other thing. We can’t 
play all three 
goalies in one 
game or one 
weekend. But 
as the season 
progresses, 
it’s going to be 
guys 
moving 

up or moving 
down. 
It’s 

going to be up 
to them. It’s 
not like we’ve 
got a starting goalie that plays 
all the games.”

HIGH-ENERGY 

PRACTICES: Due to a bye 
week, by the time Michigan 
takes on Niagara on Nov. 13, 12 
days will have passed since its 
last game.

Following 
the 
Wolverines’ 

loss to Robert Morris, Berenson 
expressed that he would much 
rather forego the bye week and 
have another game sooner. 

That 
being 
said, 
it 
may 

have seemed concerning that 
Michigan had over a week to 
mull over a bad loss at home.

But 
despite 
Berenson’s 

original concerns, the man at 
the helm likes what he is seeing 
out of his team to begin practice 
this week.

“I think our tempo was 

good,” 
Berenson 
said. 
“You 

can feel there’s a little bit more 
enthusiasm, you know. We know 
we’ve got a game in sight now. It 
seems like we haven’t played for 
a month. But I think our team 
will have a good week.”

LARKIN 
RETURNS 
TO 

YOST: The Wolverines had a 
special guest observing their 
practice on Monday: former 
forward Dylan Larkin, who left 
Michigan for the NHL after the 
2014 season.

It’s not the first time Larkin 

has 
returned 
to 
Yost, 
and 

following 
the 
practice, 
he 

spent time connecting with his 
teammates and coaches from 
last season.

Larkin has picked up where 

he left off after 
his 
47-point 

freshman 
season. 
The 

19-year-old 
rookie is plus-
11 in 14 games 
for the Detroit 
Red 
Wings, 

and has tallied 
four goals and 
six assists.

But 
that 

doesn’t 
mean 
Larkin 
has 

forgotten the good times he had 
donning the maize and blue, and 
he had words of advice for his 
old teammates if their time in 
the NHL arrives.

“(I just miss) being a student 

athlete and being here with all 
these guys,” Larkin said. “(They 
should) just enjoy their time 
here. When everyone gets there, 
be confident and realize that even 
though there are some players 
that you grow up watching, that 
you’re there for a reason. You’re 
on the same ice as them, and you 
can’t take a back seat.”

INJURIES: 
Junior 

defenseman Kevin Lohan will 
be unavailable for Friday’s game 
against Niagara after suffering 
an upper-body injury prior to 
the Robert Morris series. But 
Berenson is optimistic about the 
blueliner’s return.

“Lohan will be out for this 

weekend,” Berenson said “But I 
think next week, we’d probably 
say he’s a candidate for the 
following game (against Boston 
University).”

“It seems like 

we haven’t 
played for a 

month.”

Wolverines could run on Duncan

Robinson gives 

Michigan another 

3-point threat

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Friday night, Duncan Robinson 

did 
his 
best 
Nik 
Stauskas 

impression.

After sitting out last season due 

to NCAA transfer rules, Robinson 
made his long-awaited debut in 
an exhibition against Le Moyne. 
The redshirt sophomore guard 
entered the game with 13 minutes 
left in the first half, caught a pass 
from redshirt freshman forward 
D.J. Wilson on the left side of the 
arc and fired. Swoosh.

“Coming off the bench, I 

usually like to get a couple of 
minutes under my belt before I 
jack one up,” Robinson said. “But 
D.J. made a good pass on that first 
one, and I found myself open.”

Just 64 seconds into his 

Michigan career, the Williams 
College transfer looked to be as 
smooth-shooting as advertised — 
as Stauskas-like as advertised.

Truth be told, Stauskas wasted 

even 
less 
time 
introducing 

himself to Michigan faithful. 
On Nov. 1, 2012, in an exhibition 
contest 
against 
Northern 

Michigan, 
Stauskas 
debuted 

five minutes into the first half. 
Six seconds after coming off the 
bench, then-freshman forward 
Glenn Robinson III dished to 
Stauskas, who drained a 3.

A bit less time off the clock than 

it took Robinson, but that might 

be the only difference. Consider 
this: In Stauskas’ debut, he went 
5-for-8 from the field, 4-for-6 
from 3-point range and tallied 17 
points in 19 minutes. On Friday, 
Robinson 
was 
6-for-10 

on 
field-goal 

attempts, 3-for-
6 from deep 
and totaled 15 
points 
in 
18 

minutes.

Robinson 

might be just 
the 
piece 
to 

fill 
the 
void 

Stauskas 
left 

beyond the arc. In the 2013-14 
season, the Wolverines attempted 
794 3-pointers and made 319 of 
them. Stauskas accounted for 
29 percent of those made. Last 

year, after Stauskas left to the 
NBA, Michigan suffered from 
the perimeter — making 70 
fewer 3-pointers and attempting 
nearly 100 fewer. In Stauskas’ 

sophomore 
season, 
Michigan 
ranked 
first 

in 
3-point 

percentage 
in 

Big Ten games, 
but 
without 

him last year, it 
ranked eighth.

Take 

away 
two 

inches 
from 

Robinson’s 6-foot-8 stature and 
add three-finger goggles in front 
of his eye after a made 3-pointer, 
and you might not be able to 
tell the difference between him 

and the 6-foot-6 sharpshooting 
Stauskas.

Robinson 
might 
not 
have 

all the swagger that Stauskas 
had, but he does have one thing 
that 
the 
former 
Wolverine 

doesn’t: 
Michigan’s 
practice 

shooting record. Last December, 
Michigan men’s basketball coach 
John Beilein said Robinson broke 
the team’s practice shooting 
record that formerly belonged to 
Stauskas. Stauskas — now playing 
with the Philadelphia 76ers — 
told the Daily this summer he 
has heard that Robinson might 
even be able to take him in a 
1-on-1 shoot-off.

One thing Stauskas had that 

Robinson 
doesn’t 
have 
yet, 

though, is a spot in the starting 
lineup. The last time he came off 
the bench was in high school; he 

doesn’t 
completely 
remember 

when. At Williams, Robinson was 
the only freshman starter who 
coach Mike Maker had in his six 
years there, and for good reason. 
Robinson led the Red Foxes to a 
28-5 record and shot 45.6 percent 
from deep in his only year with 
the team. For now, Robinson is 
OK with his off-the-bench role.

“There’s 
definitely 
some 

advantages to coming off the 
bench,” he said. “You’ve got to 
get a feel for the game in the first 
couple of minutes. Maybe see 
what’s working offensively as 
a team, what (the opponent) is 
doing and stuff like that. (It’s a) 
new perspective, but I’m willing 
to embrace any role on this team.”

Any role. The reemergence of a 

Stauskas impressionist wouldn’t 
be a bad one for him to fill.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

“There’s definitely 
some advantages 
to coming off the 

bench.”
