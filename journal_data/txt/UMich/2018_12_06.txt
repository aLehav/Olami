LSA sophomore Catherine 
Garton 
was 
motivated 
to 
found the University of Mich-
igan’s chapter of the Citizens’ 
Climate Lobby this semester, 
because of a core belief that 
students’ voices are impera-
tive for creating policy to 
combat climate change. For 
two years, Garton was a mem-
ber of CCL’s Ann Arbor chap-
ter, one of 489 active chapters 
the organization maintains. 
Its main goal is to lobby for 
national policies that address 
carbon emissions and climate 
change in every congressional 
district.
On Nov. 27, the main policy 
for which the CCL had been 
advocating was introduced to 
Congress: a national carbon 
price, known as The Energy 
Innovation and Carbon Divi-
dend Act of 2018 (H.R.7173). 
The bill is sponsored by U.S. 
Reps. 
Theodore 
Deutch, 
D-Fla.; 
Brian 
Fitzpatrick, 
R-Pa.; John Delaney, D-Md.; 
Francis Rooney, R-Fla.; Char-
lie Crist, D-Fla.; and David 
Trott, R-Mich.
In a statement regarding 
the introduction of the bill, 
CCL said it hoped Rep. Deb-
bie Dingell, D-Mich., would 
co-sponsor the bill, “either 
now or when the bill is rein-
troduced in the new Con-
gress.” Dingell, a member 
of the House Committee on 

Energy and Commerce, said 
Congress had act on climate 
change now, but did not speci-
fy whether she would cospon-
sor the bill.
“It’s time that Congress 
takes action to address cli-
mate change and ensures that 
the US is a world leader in 
addressing global warming,” 
Dingell wrote in an email 
to The Michigan Daily. “In 
Michigan and on the Energy 
and Commerce Committee 
I’m having critical conversa-
tions about changing the sta-
tus quo and taking action now. 
Our economy and environ-
ment are at stake and we must 
think outside the box to miti-
gate irreversible damage.”

The policy applies a fee on 
the carbon dioxide content 
of fossil fuel producers at a 
starting rate of $15 per ton 
in 2019 and increasing by $10 
per ton annually. The revenue 
generated from this fee would 
be subsequently redistributed 
equally among U.S. house-
holds through tax rebates, 
and a border carbon adjust-
ment fee protects U.S. manu-
facturers by applying that 
price to imported goods. The 
policy also restricts addition-
al regulation and stops the 
yearly price rise beyond $15 if 
the annual 5 percent emission 
reduction target is being met. 
According to a 2014 study 
by Regional Economic Models 

and Synapse Energy Econom-
ics, the policy’s would result 
in a 50 percent reduction of 
carbon emissions below 1990 
levels in the next 20 years, an 
addition of 2.8 million jobs 
stimulated by the return of 
tax revenue and the preven-
tion of 230,000 premature 
deaths from air pollution. 
Deutch, a University law 
alum, introduced the bill to 
the Congress floor, empha-
sizing the need for American 
investment in clean energy 
technologies.

ACADEMICS

Growing up, life sciences 
researcher Majd Abdulghani 
watched her mother overcome 
the various obstacles she 
faced as a Muslim female 
scientist working toward her 
Ph.D. in London. With her 
mother’s determination and 
bravery in mind, Abdulghani 
will have the opportunity to 
return to England to pursue 
her own doctoral degree in 
genetics as Saudi Arabia’s 
very first Rhodes Scholar.
“My mom was doing her 
Ph.D., and that showed me 
a lot about the sort of effort 
it takes to be a scientist, but 
also at the same time, how 
wonderful it is and also how 
it’s possible to be a scientist, 
be a woman — and my mom 
is also a Muslim and wears a 
headscarf,” Abdulghani said. 
“She was doing all of this 
while raising three teenagers 

and two children, so she was 
really an inspiration for me 
at that point in my life and 
continues to be.”
Once her mother completed 
her Ph.D. and the family 
returned to Saudi Arabia, 
Abdulghani took a particular 
interest 
in 
genetics. 
She 
recalled 
how 
her 
mother 
encouraged her to pursue the 
field and since then, she has 
enjoyed it thoroughly.
“When I went back to 
Saudi Arabia, I was ready to 
go to college and I chose to 
become a geneticist because 
I just really enjoyed it in high 
school,” Abdulghani said. “I 
remember my mom said to me, 
‘Don’t you want to discover 
the gene that cures cancer?’ 
And while that’s probably not 
going to happen for biological 
reasons, that’s why I chose 
to study genetics. It’s been 
incredibly rewarding so far.

New lecturer initative working to make all three ‘U’ campuses more equitable in funding 

KATHERINA SOURINE
Daily Staff Reporter 

On 
Wednesday 
evening, 
the 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 
Organization held its first of 
several Ann Arbor community 
forums to discuss the launch of 
the One University Campaign, 
which 
strives 
to 
make 
all 
three University of Michigan 
campuses 
more 
equitable 
learning institutions.
Despite the fact that the 

LEO’s 
tumultuous 
contract 
bargaining process last semester 
resulted in significant budget 
increases 
for 
lecturers, 
the 
lecturers point out gains were 
not distributed equally across 
all three University campuses. 
LEO at U-M Dearborn and the 
U-M Flint has held parallel 
community 
forums 
to 
work 
toward parity. About 25 students, 
graduate 
student 
instructors 
and lecturers across all three 
campuses attended the Ann 
Arbor forum.

“Although 
we 
made 
real 
substantial progress last time 
around … that did not reduce 
the gap between Flint and 
Dearborn,” LEO President Ian 
Robinson, a sociology professor 
on the Ann Arbor campus, said. 
In fact, he explained despite the 
50 percent increases in minimum 
wages on all three campuses, 
professors at U-M Flint and 
U-M Dearborn earn, on average, 
$10,000 less per year than the 
typical Ann Arbor professor.
Not only are the professors at 

U-M Flint and U-M Dearborn 
paid less in comparison to their 
Ann Arbor peers, but they work 
significantly more hours.
“In 
Flint 
and 
Dearborn, 
(lecturers must) teach an extra 
course to be considered full-
time,” Robinson explained in an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily. “Instead of teaching three 
courses a term (like Ann Arbor 
lecturers do), they teach four.”

Inside:
The Food B-Side


Brothers of the Alpha 
Sigma 
Phi 
fraternity, 
according to texts and a 
Freedom of Information Act 
report acquired by The Ann 
Arbor News, ran a “40-yard 

dash” atop new members’ 
backs, an incident resulting 
in the fraternity’s eventual 
removal from campus after 
a University of Michigan 
Interfraternity Council vote 
earlier this month.
The 
vote 
came 
about 
after 
Hazing 
Response 
Team’s 
investigation 
of 

Alpha Sigma Phi regarding 
allegations 
of 
dangerous 
hazing 
activities. 
IFC 
determined to remove the 
fraternity for a minimum of 
five years.
Alpha 
Sigma 
Phi 
was 
also one of the fraternities 
who 
disaffiliatedfrom 
IFC in September to form 
an independent Ann 
Arbor 
Interfraternity 
Council. According to 
an IFC statement, this 
was due to changes 
in city zoning laws in 
July.
In 
text 
exchanges 
between the fraternity 
members, 
they 
describe a potentially 
serious injury befalling 
a 
student 
after 
the 
dash. Some members 
expressed 
surprise 
and 
regret 
about 
this 
incident, 
while 
others 
attributed 
it 
to the accepted risks 
of a hazing process 
called Hell Week. One 
member described the 
dash as a “normal” part 
of the process.
“We had people run 
our backs during our 
hell week,” a member 
said in a group message. 
“That doesn’t mean it’s 
a tradition or a (good) 
idea, but it means (it’s) 
become normalized by 
us.”

The University’s Office of 
Greek Life received these 
text messages and emails 
regarding the incident in 
an envelope last semester. 
The office turned over the 
envelope to the Ann Arbor 
Police Department in March. 
The 
case 
was 
dropped 
because 
the 
supposed 
victim did not comply with 
the investigation, and his 
parents claimed to police he 
wasn’t injured.
Danny 
Miller, 
the 
international 
senior 
director of prevention and 
accountability 
at 
Alpha 
Sigma 
Phi, 
told 
MLive 
the fraternity voluntarily 
disaffiliated 
from 
IFC 
before 
any 
hearings 
occurred 
regarding 
allegations 
against 
the 
chapter.
The University, however, 
began 
its 
investigation 
while the fraternity was 
still an active member of 
the IFC. Because it began at 
this time, IFC continued the 
investigation despite Alpha 
Sigma Phi’s disaffiliation.
As 
a 
result 
of 
this 
investigation, Miller told 
MLive 
some 
fraternity 
officers 
were 
removed 
from their positions and 
the chapter hired a live-in 
house director.

Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity busted

marks an important opportuni-
ty to begin to seriously address 
the immediate threat of climate 
change,” Deutch stated in a 
press release. “The status quo is 
unsustainable; the time to act is 
right now.”
According to Garton, the 
University’s CCL chapter has 
been working all semester to 
have the bill introduced, facili-
tating informational workshops 
for students to call on represen-
tatives and senators to endorse 
the environmental policy. The 
workshops also aimed to build 
CCL’s presence on campus as 
a platform to educate the com-
munity on the bill and its impli-
cations.
“We’ve written Op-Eds and 
Letters to the Editor to have an 
online presence and bring out 
the issues of climate change 
with all of their intersections 
with health, with jobs and the 
economy,” Garton said. “Cur-
rently we’re working on a bipar-
tisan event with the College 
Democrats and College Repub-
licans for early next semester, 
where we will discuss this bill 
introduced into Congress, and 
then have a time for people 
from different organizations 
and backgrounds to discuss the 
bill together, and see what they 
both like about it, any concerns 
that they have.”
Garton 
highlighted 
the 
universality of the issue, say-
ing CCL’s intentions are to 
implement policy specifically 
through the means of creating 

the political will in communi-
ties.
“Our goal is to create the 
political will for bipartisan 
solutions to climate change,” 
Garton said. “We believe that 
members of Congress don’t cre-
ate political will –– we believe 
that they respond to political 
will. And so we foresee that as 
our job to generate action and 
political will within communi-
ties.”
Public Policy junior Cathrine 
Kelly, communications director 
for the University’s chapter of 
College Democrats, shared the 
organization’s view on the bill, 
saying it was “a good starting 
point.”
“The Energy Innovation and 
Carbon Dividends Act would 
be a great step forward for our 
country. While this bill doesn’t 
cover every aspect of fixing cli-
mate change, it is a good start-
ing point,” she wrote in an email 
interview. “It is amazing to see 
any bill, let alone a bill that is 
meant to clean up our environ-
ment, that is cosponsored by 
both Republicans and Demo-
crats. As College Democrats, 
we know that the state of our 
environment is one of the most 
pressing issues of our genera-
tion. Now is the time to step up 
and make the changes needed 
to secure a clean environment 
not only for our generation, but 
for the generations to come.”
Last May, the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans 
rescinded its endorsement of 
the bill, citing data from the 
Heritage Foundation that esti-
mated the implementation of 
the tax would result in the 
loss of 400,000 jobs in the U.S 

and increase electricity costs 
for U.S households by 13 to 20 
percent. College Republicans 
President Dylan Berger, an LSA 
sophomore, commented on the 
organization’s continued stance 
on the issue.
“We continue to oppose any 
renewed efforts to implement 
this tax on the American peo-
ple,” Berger wrote in an email 
interview. “While we believe 
in climate change and want 
to address the issue head on, a 
massive tax on the American 
people is not the way to do it. 
We cannot in good faith advo-
cate for a measure that would 
harm so many of our nation’s 
hard working families. Going 
forward, we want to be part of a 
solution that will both preserve 
our environment for genera-
tions to come and continue eco-
nomic prosperity.”
Trott signed onto the bill 
on 
Nov. 
29, 
showing 
the diversity of opinion 
within the Republican 
Party on the policy’s effective-
ness.
LSA junior Hallie Fox, out-
reach chair of the University’s 
CCL chapter, was one of five 
members of the group who 
attended a trip to Washing-
ton, D.C. to get CCL-sponsored 
training on advocacy experi-
ence speaking to several repre-
sentatives on Capitol Hill. Fox 
highlighted the importance of 
the skills she gained and the 
vital role students have on cam-
pus.
“Students are the backbone 
of the University, and what I’ve 
heard from a lot of University 
professionals is that when stu-
dents want something to get 

done, it gets done,” she said.
Fox emphasized the impor-
tance of undertaking an active 
role immediately, not only in 
response 
to 
global 
current 
events, like the United Nations’ 
Intergovernmental 
Panel 
on 
Climate Change’s report, which 
predicted a high probability of 
food shortages, wildfires and 
coral reef depletion by 2040, 
but also at events on campus, 
such as the recent $80 million 
expansion of the University’s 
Central Power Plant and Uni-
versity President Mark Schlis-
sel’s announcement to set the 
University 
on 
a 
trajectory 
toward carbon neutrality.
“One of the things that we 
are doing right now is that 
many of environmental groups 
on campus are going to the 
regents meeting on Thursday, 
to kind of protest but also advo-
cate for a more comprehensive 
climate plan, especially for the 
power plant,” she said. “Mainly, 
the climate plan is a little bit too 
vague for a lot of what people 
who are involved in conversa-
tion on campus taste for.”
She stressed the unique role 
and opportunity that students 
have in political issues.
“It’s really important to get 
involved on a campus level 
because I think the city of Ann 
Arbor actually really looks to 
the University to do a lot of pro-
gressive action on things like 
climate change,” Fox said. “Not 
being afraid to stand up for 
yourself and stand up for your 
future –– I think that’s real-
ly important especially since 
we’re on a university campus 
and we’re encouraged to show 
our beliefs.”

I love being a geneticist and I 
can’t wait to see where being 
a Rhodes Scholar takes me as 
well.”
The Rhodes Scholarship is 
a prestigious award offered 
to students who demonstrate 
academic excellence, mastery in 
various extracurricular areas, 
moral character and leadership 
ability. The scholarship only 
became 
available 
to 
Saudi 
students in 2018 and was 
funded by Muhammad Alagil, 
chairman of Jarir Group. His 
donation added Saudi Arabia as 
one of many worldwide Rhodes 
constituencies. As a Rhodes 
Scholar, Abdulghani will have 
the 
opportunity 
to 
receive 
her Ph.D. at the University of 
Oxford in England.
Along with a passion for 
science, Abdulghani had other 
hobbies 
including 
karate 
and recording episodes for 
her award-winning podcast, 
“Majd’s Diary: Two Years in 
the Life of a Saudi Girl by Radio 
Diaries” of NPR. Though the 
large audience was daunting 
at times, Abdulghani found her 
podcast especially rewarding 
because she was able to connect 
with people around the globe.
“I think (the podcast) was 
valuable,” 
Abdulghani 
said. 
“This vulnerability that ended 
up making it in the podcast, 
this is what all people share 
across the world, this is what 
really makes us human and this 
is what can really connect with. 
That’s what made a lot people 
from 
various 
places 
across 
the world, and from starkly 
different 
backgrounds 
from 
mine reach out and tell me that 
they could relate to me.”
As it so happened, Vivian 
Cheung, 
research 
professor 
at the Life Sciences Institute, 
heard 
Abdulghani’s 
podcast 
about her experiences growing 
up in Saudi Arabia and her 
dreams of pursuing science 
in the future. Cheung was so 
moved by her determination 
that 
she 
called 
the 
NPR 
station and was eventually 
put in touch with Abdulghani. 
The 
two 
women 
remained 
in touch over the years, and 
upon Abdulghani’s completion 
of 
her 
master’s 
at 
Iowa 
State University, she began 
working in Cheung’s lab at the 
University of Michigan.
Cheung praised Abdulghani’s 
investigative work ethic and 
scientific thinking that allowed 
her to explore the realm of 
what is possible in regard to 
research.

“She’s absolutely terrific,” 
Cheung said. “She’s fearless 
and she’s very careful but also 
really allows herself to kind 
of see where science takes her 
rather than being tied down by 
what is known. I think she will 
make an amazing scientist — 
she really follows the data and 
goes where it takes us.”
Henry Dyson, director of the 
Office of National Scholarships 
and Fellowships, also noted 
Abdulghani’s 
eloquence 
and 
motivation. 
Dyson 
had 
the 
opportunity 
to 
work 
with 
Abdulghani as she prepared 
for her final interview with the 
Rhodes committee.
“I was really excited to meet 
her,” Dyson said. “She (had) at 
that point already been offered 
a finalist review, so we set up a 
practice interview for her and 
I knew within the first five 
minutes — I mean this is easy to 
say in retrospect — but I knew 
in the first five minutes that 
she had a very good chance of 
winning.”
Abdulghani confessed she 
was initially uncertain about 
what type of assistance ONSF 
would 
offer 
her 
because 
she was not a student at the 
University, but instead a staff 
member. However her meeting 
with Dyson resolved many of 
her concerns, and she praised 
him for helping her prepare for 
her final interview.
“I was like, ‘Well I’m not 
really a student, I’m a staff 
member, why would he pay any 
attention to me?’’’ Abdulghani 
said. “But as soon as I walked in 
his office, he was energetic. He 
was always excited for me and 
he went out of his way, despite 
the short amount of time that 
was between my meeting with 
him and my interview at the 
Rhodes — I think it was about 
two or three weeks max— 
he went out of his way to do 
everything he could for me.”
After finishing her Ph.D. at 
Oxford, Abdulghani hopes to 
return to Saudi Arabia, become 
a 
professor 
and 
eventually 
establish a research hub for 
women in the Gulf region.
“I really want to get research 
going 
in 
Saudi 
Arabia,” 
Abdulghani said. “There is 
a lot of research happening, 
but I don’t think it’s quite 
enough 
yet. 
There 
is 
not 
enough involvement of women 
in research; the percentage 
of Saudi women faculty in 
scientific fields is extremely 
low. I think it’s around 30 
percent and we really need 
to fix that. I hope to go back 
to Saudi Arabia and initiate a 
research hub eventually that 
provides world class education 

in research to people across 
Saudi Arabia and across the 
region.”
Dyson 
expressed 
his 
excitement for Abdulghani’s 
goals in the future and praised 
her ability to intertwine her 
identities 
and passions 
with 
what 
she hopes to 
accomplish.
“One of the things that’s 
so interesting about Majd is 
how (speaks) in her blog about 
her lived experience, that she 
does have these other pursuits, 
such as karate and horseback 
riding,” Dyson said. “But also... 
she interprets those things 
through her Islamic values, 
practices and heritages and 
how she’s able to talk about 
how those things contribute to 
her vision for what she wants 
to do with women’s education 
in Saudi Arabia in the future.”
Though 
Abdulghani 
is 
hopeful 
for 
her 
post-Ph.D. 
plans, she also acknowledged 
some of the challenges that 
come 
with 
being 
a 
Saudi 
Muslim 
woman 
pursuing 
science. 
However, 
she 
is 
optimistic that her journey and 
the obstacles she has faced will 
inspire others to realize their 
own dreams are achievable as 
well.
“This might be self-imposed, 
but I definitely feel like I’m 
still navigating how to be a 
hijabi and a biologist at the 
same time,” Abdulghani said. 
“I hope that this is really just in 
my head, and that people don’t 
actually attach these thoughts 
to my identity, but right now 
I think it’s challenging. But, I 
hope that what I’m doing will 
encourage more women, and 
Muslims, and hijabis to be in 
the sciences.”
With ambitious plans for the 
future, Abdulghani reflected 
back once again on how her 
mother’s 
experience 
and 
encouragement inspire her to 
remain optimistic about what 
she is capable of doing as a 
Rhodes Scholar. 
“If I could give the Rhodes 
Scholarship to anyone else, 
I would give it to my mom,” 
Abdulghani 
said. 
“She 
has 
overcome so many obstacles 
and when I see that, I ask her, 
‘How am I supposed to do 
that, too, when you’re facing 
all of these problems and 
being a Saudi woman scientist, 
how can I come back and do 
anything?’ She always brings 
out the positive energy and 
she always encourages me to 
come back and telling me that 
because these problems exist, 
this is why I need to get the 
Rhodes Scholarship.”

president’s decision.
“The press announcement 
by interim President Engler 
announcing the closure of 
the Healing Assistance Fund 
came as a surprise and we 
do not support his decision,” 
the statement read. “This 
decision is counter to the 
research and advice provided 
to us by the Relationship 
Violence 
and 
Sexual 
Misconduct Expert Advisory 
Working Group.”
According 
to 
Rachel 
Campbell, the chair of MSU’s 
Relationship 
Violence 
and 
Sexual Misconduct Expert 
Advisory Workgroup, when 
asked by members of Engler’s 
administration what should 
be done about the fund, 
the group advised the fund 
should be reopened as soon 
as 
possible. 
The 
group’s 
document, 
“Summary 
of 
Research on Trauma and 
Treatment for Sexual Assault 
Survivors,” was published in 
The State News. 
“If sexual assault survivors 
have entered into treatment 
based on the understanding 
that there were dedicated 
funds available to cover the 
cost of therapy, and then 
learn that they are no longer 
eligible for those funds, they 
are likely to feel that such 
changes are a gross violation 
of trust,” the summary read. 
“This betrayal will likely 
cause 
significant 
distress 

that will compound trauma 
symptoms they are already 
experiencing.”
Engler’s decision to cut the 
fund has incited criticism 
from Rachael Denhollander, 
who was the first survivor to 
publicly share her story about 
Nassar’s abuse.
In a series of tweets, 
Denhollander 
laid 
out 
a 
timeline of the fund, and said 
“Engler/MSU are lying about 
the 
purposes, 
terms 
and 
circumstances of creation, 
for this fund,” also writing 
MSU determined in October 
no survivors had committed 
fraud related to the fund.
“MSU creates fund to help 
survivors 
in 
December,” 
Denhollander wrote. “At this 
time, they are trying to get our 
suit dismissed and refusing 
to answer calls. Fund was not 
‘until settlement’. MSU was 
refusing to even talk and had 
no plans to settle.”
The statement released by 
the four MSU board members 
said they plan on discussing 
the issue with the full board 
at the next meeting Friday. 
Their hope is to force the 
reinstatement of the Healing 
Fund.
“At every possible turn, @
MSUPresEngler 
confirms 
the abusive culture at MSU, 
the utter lack of meaningful 
change, and his abhorrent 
views on SA victims. MSU 
spokesperson Emily Guerrant 
and the BoT needs to stop 
agreeing to spew his lies. This 
is shameful,” Denhollander 
wrote.

Wednesday morning and will resume next semester starting January 23rd. 

interviews with MLive other 
tweets he’s made in the past 
were in poor taste. An article 
from July noted Hayner made 
his account private, though 
Hayner’s account has since 
been deleted.
In one tweet regarding a 
past Michigan Daily article 
about the April 2017 sale of 
the Library Lot, Hayner called 
Councilmember Julie Grand, 
D-Ward 3, a “hive queen” 
and added the hashtag #RBF, 
which some Twitter users 
suspect stands for “resting 
bitch face.”
“Best 
coverage 
of 
#a2council often found in alt 
news sources,” the tweet read. 
“Don’t miss this w/accurate 
quote 
from 
condescending 
Hive Queen Grand #RBF.”
Dzombak said these tweets 
may negatively impact the 
dynamics of the council now 
that Hayner is a member.
“In some of these tweets, 
he 
was 
very 
critical 
of 
councilmembers … I think it’s 
an uphill battle,” Dzombak 
said. “It seems like he’s burned 
a lot of bridges before he even 
got on council.”
Grand declined to comment 
on Hayner’s tweets.
A 
Digital 
Millennium 

Copyright Act request was 
filed on Aug. 1 that briefly 
shut 
the 
database 
down. 
DMCA requests address the 
takedown of online material 
due to copyright infringement. 
Dzombak does not know if 
Hayner submitted the request 
himself.
Dzombak 
said 
Hayner 
accused him of hacking his 
Twitter account when it was 
private.
“These were public tweets 
when 
I 
archived 
them,” 
Dzombak said. “Claiming that 
I did any sort of illegal hacking 
is blatantly false.”
Dzombak said Hayner made 
many tweets that did not align 
with emocratic values.
“In the last four years 
or so, he’s made a bunch of 
comments 
on 
Twitter 
on 
things like SJWs (social justice 
warriors), snowflakes, Milo 
Yiannopoulos, that are not 
consistent with a progressive 
democratic agenda,” Dzombak 
said. 
“It 
seemed 
really 
dishonest that he was running 
as a Democrat here.”
One of Hayner’s tweets 
mentioning 
“snowflakes” 
detailed colleges handing out 
pins with gender pronouns on 
them.
“College hands out ‘pronoun 
pins’ 
#Triggered 
by 
this, 
does exclusion help people 
#coexist? 
#snowFLAKES,” 

Hayner tweeted.
A tweet also mention Ryan 
Hughes, Hayner’s opponent 
during the 2018 City Council 
election, regarding Hughes’ 
yearly income and Hughes’ 
support for an income tax.
“Ryan Hughes is making 
$90K/year at U of M, and 
telling me I need to pay an 
income tax to support people 
who need affordable housing,” 
Hayner 
allegedly 
wrote. 
“Charity starts at home.”
Hughes 
said 
affordable 
housing should not be up to 
charity.
“I don’t think charity is 
the issue here,” Hughes said. 
“I 
don’t 
think 
affordable 
housing should be a matter of 
individual choosing whether 
or not to pay to a charitable 
foundation.”
Hughes said Hayner may 
not have intended to offend 
residents, but his comments 
still hurt people.
“Impact isn’t the same thing 
as intent,” Hughes said. “Even 
if you mean well, you might 
hurt people.”
Regardless, 
Hughes 
is 
optimistic 
about 
Hayner’s 
future work on City Council.
“I think he’s toned down 
criticism of these people,” 
Hughes said. “I’m looking 
forward to seeing how he’s 
going to actually be.”

ow that the midterm 
elections are over with 
and Democrats won the 
popular vote in the House by the 
largest margins since Watergate, 
it is safe to turn our attention to 
2020, albeit a bit early. Despite 
some rumblings from Ohio Gov. 
John 
Kasich, 
the 
Republican 
presidential nominee for president 
will most likely be Donald Trump. 
On the left, though, a competitive 
race seems to be shaping up, 
giving Democratic voters as many 
choices as required to choose their 
ideal 2020 candidate.
Of 
course, 
there 
will 
be 
some in the media who push a 
Democrats-in-disarray story both 
because it is easy and because it 
conforms to a long-held narrative 
about the Democratic Party’s 
inability to truly be inclusive of 
fiscal conservatives and social 
progressives at the same time. 
There will undoubtedly be think-
pieces analyzing party infighting 
about whether to move toward 
the middle or the left. While we 
should absolutely have serious 
policy debates on questions such 
as the merits of Medicare for 
all versus public option health 
insurance, the Democratic Party 
has always been a big tent party 
filled with voters from left of 
center to the far left. And that’s 
okay. It simply means we have 
more voices and perspectives 
contributing to the effort to solve 
our country’s problems and help 
as many Americans as we can.
In 2020, we unquestionably 
need a nominee who aligns with 
the party’s values as we define 
them in the coming months, but 
they should also have the ability 
to unite the country through 
inspiration and a vision of hope. 
While fear is a very powerful 
motivational 
tool—especially 
in politics as evidenced most 
recently 
by 
Trump’s 
2016 
presidential campaign— hope and 
change the old adages of President 
Barack Obama, are exactly what 
so many Americans are deeply 
craving for our country.
While 
there 
haven’t 
been 
any major announcements of 
presidential bids quite yet, there 
is ongoing list of people dipping 
their toes in the water, gathering 
advisers and pollsters to make 
their decision and shying away 

from the question on Sunday 
shows. These candidates cover 
the 
entire 
spectrum 
of 
the 
Democratic 
Party, 
including 
former Massachusetts Gov. Deval 
Patrick, former Vice President 
Joe Biden, former Virginia Gov. 
Terry McAuliffe, and Sens. Cory 
Booker, 
Kirsten 
Gillibrand, 
Kamala Harris and Elizabeth 
Warren. All of these potential 
candidates 
have 
their 
own 
strengths and weaknesses, and 
it would be futile to guess which 
ones will appeal most to voters in 
2020.
A few names missing from 
the list are Sen. Bernie Sanders, 
former New York City mayor 
Michael 
Bloomberg, 
former 
Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz 
and venture capitalist Tom Steyer, 
who have all expressed interest 
in running but do not actually 
have any stake to the Democratic 
Party.
It is important that the party 
does not over-adjust itself in an 
effort to learn something from 
the 2016 election; it would be 
unwise to choose a candidate 
whose 
identity 
and 
policies 
capitulate in an attempt to appeal 
to Trump voters. Though it was 
heartbreaking to witness Andrew 
Gillum of Florida, Stacey Abrams 
of Georgia, and Beto O’Rourke 
of Texas lose their exciting 
campaigns, it is important to 
remember those exciting and 
progressive 
candidates 
came 
closer to winning their elections 
than any of the previous bland, 
moderate 
candidates 
had 
in 
recent history. If then-Georgia 
State Secretary Georgia Brian 
Kemp 
hadn’t 
disenfranchised 
tends of thousands of Black 
and Democratic voters, Stacey 
Abrams would be the governor-
elect of Georgia right now. The 
lesson from these races is not that 
we should run more moderate 
candidates, it is that we need 
to do a whole lot of work to end 
the effects of gerrymandering, 
voter 
suppression 
and 
disenfranchisement. 
And 
we 
must remember this for 2020.
Only a candidate who instills 
a sense of hopefulness about 
this country’s ability to fulfill 
its founding promise will excite 
enough voters, enough Americans, 
to triumph over division and fear 

to win the presidency. This sense 
of hopefulness will come from 
the alignment of the candidates’ 
personal stories and their visions 
of the future. Their policies 
will need to be big and bold, 
their rhetoric skills genuine and 
uplifting.
We 
should 
refrain 
from 
declaring 
that 
we 
cannot 
nominate another Black man or 
woman, or white man for that 
matter, just because of history. If 
Beto O’Rourke, a conventionally 
attractive, white, straight man, 
is able to connect to voters and 
deliver a message of hope better 
than any other candidate, then he 
should be the nominee. However, 
we should also consider how 
being a conventionally attractive, 
white, straight man allows him 
to connect to voters more easily 
than someone who is not those 
things. Take Kamala Harris, for 
example, who is a Black woman. 
Because we have seen people 
similar to O’Rourke as president 
in the past, it is much easier to 
imagine him as president. And 
because we have never seen a 
Black female president, it is much 
harder to imagine how she will 
lead and govern, and people tend 
to turn away from that which 
they cannot imagine generally 
out 
of 
misguided 
fear 
and 
uncertainty. Sometimes, though, 
leaning into that is exactly what 
leads to the very best results; 
perhaps having a literally brand-
new type of leader is exactly 
what this country so desperately 
needs. As a party, it is important 
that the Democratic nominee for 
president in 2020 — or at least, the 
ticket — is representative of the 
party’s own demographics.
There 
is 
no 
one 
magical 
candidate that can appeal to 
every single American and solve 
every single issue. But there is a 
candidate in the sea of hopefuls 
who will inspire us to be active in 
the democratic process, who will 
try to unite rather than divide 
us, who will remind of us all of 
the greatness of this American 
experiment. 
And 
she 
should 
absolutely be the Democratic 
nominee for president of the 
United States in 2020.

MARISA WRIGHT | COLUMN

marisadw@umich.edu.

Historically, 
both 
sides 
of the aisle use this time to 
push last minute legislation 
in favor of their own party’s 
agenda before the change 
in power halts their efforts. 
However, 
the 
Republican 
response 
to 
the 
election 
of Democrats to all three 
Michigan statewide offices 
this year is unprecedented 
and ultimately subversive of 
the will of Michigan voters. 
Democratic state candidates 
were elected to the positions 
of 
governor, 
attorney 
general 
and 
secretary 
of 
state for the first time in 
almost 20 years. Yet both 
legislative chambers remain 
Republican, in part due to 
partisan 
gerrymandering. 
Michigan state Republicans 
have failed to gain a majority 
of votes in either legislative 
house 
despite 
gaining 
a 
majority of seats in both, now 
using their power obtained 
through gerrymandering to 
pass last minute legislation 
in 
direct 
opposition 
to 
statewide 
results. 
They’re 
not just pushing an agenda; 
they’re proposing legislation 
that 
directly 
undermines 
Michigan voters and actively 
works 
against 
democratic 
norms.
So 
far, 
Michigan 
state 
Republicans have proposed 
delaying 
a 
raise 
in 
the 
minimum wage that would 
reach $12 by 2022. Instead, 
they 
have 
pushed 
this 
increase to only take full 
effect by 2030. In addition, 
they also pushed to decrease 
paid sick leave from accruing 
at a rate of one hour every 
30 hours worked to one hour 
for every 40 hours worked. 
Essentially, paid sick leave 
would then be cut from 72 
hours per year to 36 hours per 
year for the average worker. 
Both of these elements of 
the 
minimum 
wage 
bill 
undoubtedly hurt working-
class citizens of Michigan, 
but even worse is how they 

directly invalidate the voice 
of Michigan voters.
The 
minimum 
wage 
initiative 
had 
enough 
signatures 
to 
appear 
on 
the 
ballot 
in 
November, 
but was removed when the 
state 
legislature 
adopted 
the proposal in September. 
Hence, 
the 
Republican 
legislature 
adopted 
the 
bill with the sole purpose 
of 
changing 
it 
after 
the 
elections, defying the will 

of a citizen-led effort at One 
Fair Wage that had garnered 
the 
support 
from 
voters 
across the state. The original 
proposal’s 
minimum 
wage 
increase 
would 
have 
had 
important effects, especially 
in areas like Wayne County 
where 60,000 work in jobs 
with a median hourly wage of 
fewer than $10 per hour. In 
essence, the GOP capitalized 
on 
the 
opportunity 
to 
thwart 
incoming 
officials 
and, in doing so, prevented 
a 
grassroots 
initiative 
that could have positively 
impacted 
thousands. 
If 
anything, 
this 
shows 
how 
entrenched 
power 
hungriness 
is 
in 
politics, 
and the GOP’s overt favoring 
of its position in politics, 
rather than the wishes of its 
constituents.
A 
third 
Republican 
proposal would limit the 
secretary of state’s power 
in 
campaign 
finance 
oversight 
while 
another 
would guarantee that the 

legislature — still controlled 
by the GOP — would have 
the right to intervene in 
any legal battles involving 
state laws that the attorney 
general 
doesn’t 
comment 
on 
or 
defend. 
Michigan 
voters elected their attorney 
general 
and 
secretary 
of 
state, yet the Republican 
legislature 
is 
trying 
to 
negate their elections. These 
proposals are gross abuses 
of power; the Republican 
legislature is manipulating 
the democratic process to 
fit its agenda, an unabashed 
affront to its voters. Petty 
partisan 
politics 
have 
once again impeded good 
governance and effectively 
disenfranchised 
Michigan 
voters.
These 
proposals 
aren’t 
just 
abstract 
procedural 
changes; they will have a 
real impact on students and 
the University of Michigan 
community. 
Raising 
the 
minimum wage can increase 
living standards as living 
costs rise. Paid sick leave 
ensures employees can stay 
home 
when 
they’re 
sick, 
allowing themselves to get 
better while not posing any 
risks to their colleagues. 
We that worry under this 
change, more workers will 
have to choose between their 
health and their paycheck 
solely 
because 
a 
scorned 
and unpopular party chose 
to override the will of the 
voters.
When 
State 
House 
and 
Senate Republicans exploit 
their 
constitutionally 
delegated powers for their 
own political goals, they defy 
the 
democratic 
standards 
to 
which 
we 
hold 
our 
governmental processes. A 
smooth transition of power is 
something the U.S. typically 
prides 
itself 
on, 
but 
the 
blatant power grab of the 
GOP is an outward disregard 
of such precedents.

A 

couple of weeks ago, 
a friend told me to 
apply for an internship 
at 
Palantir, 
a 
company 
that specializes in big data 
analytics. I scrolled through 
the job’s description, wrote a 
quick cover letter and left my 
application untouched for a 
couple of weeks.
At the very same time, the Los 
Angeles police were stopping 
people 
in 
low-income 
areas 
without any clear reason. Manuel 
Rios, a 22-year-old who lives in 
the city’s gang populated area 
was stopped dozens of times 
ever since a police officer took a 
photograph of him after being 
seen with a gang member. Rios 
was never part of a gang, but 
when the police officer took 
his photograph, he was told, 
“Welcome to the gang database!” 
That “gang database” was created 
by Palantir in collaboration with 
the 
L.A. 
police, 
automating 
the targeting of supposed gang 
members. Once a person’s profile 
enters that database, it gets stuck 
there forever, and it gives police 
officers an additional reason 
to constantly invade a person’s 
privacy. For Rios, who has spent 
most of his life doing his best to 
stay away from gang activity, it 
only draws him closer to it.
This is one example of the many 
collaborations of which Palantir 
is part: from working with J.P. 
Morgan to spy on its employees 
to having one of its employees 
work with Cambridge Analytica 
to use Facebook’s users’ personal 
data. As J.P. Morgan’s former 
chief information officer, Guy 
Chiarello put it, Palantir turns 
“data landfills into gold mines.” 
The kind of “data landfills” 
he is talking about allow the 
company to build both police and 
immigration departments models 
that match citizens with labels 
such as “Colleague of,” “Lives 
with,” “Owner of,” and “Lover 
of.” 
Palantir’s blog posts talk about 
its belief in regulations that 
govern data privacy, and about 

its Privacy and Civil Liberties 
Team. Their actions, though, 
tell a different story. Only later 
did I find out that in a company 
managing hundreds of projects 
and thousands of employees, this 
particular team consisted of only 
10 people. I deleted my internship 
application.
There is a lot of talk nowadays 
about algorithmic bias — which 
makes a lot of people think 
there is something wrong with 
the 
algorithms 
themselves. 
In Palantir’s case, though, it’s 
not the algorithms that have a 
problem, but the data that the 
company uses and the way it 
uses the information. But can we 
restrict the manner in which a 
company chooses to use its data?

Hannah Fry, a mathematician 
who recently wrote a book 
on how algorithms affect our 
society, has been advocating 
for 
creating 
a 
regulatory 
government body to check the 
type of data and algorithms 
that companies are deploying. 
At this moment, any company 
is allowed to use any data, 
in any manner it wants. It’s 
the equivalent of having any 
company put any substance in 
a bottle and sell it under any 
label. The same way the FDA 
protects both the intellectual 
property of companies, while 
also ensuring the benefits of 
a product outweigh its harms. 
Is there a way to do this with 
algorithms? Probably. But as 
long as Silicon Valley is on 
track to be the top corporate 
lobbying spender, companies 

will 
likely 
continue 
doing 
whatever they want with our 
data.
People are increasingly not 
willing to share their data 
with companies. Governments 
are casting a suspicious eye 
toward companies collecting 
data from their customers. 
Right now, we live in a time 
when companies like Palantir 
are generating a lot of profit by 
leveraging data that users and 
governments 
unknowingly 
give up on. But what will 
happen five, 10 years from 
now? What will happen when 
all citizens will understand 
that their right to privacy is 
intertwined with the data 
they share? What will happen 
when more governments will 
decide to protect their citizens 
instead of their tech world 
benefactors? Will companies 
like Palantir even be feasible?
It was only after a lawsuit 
that the Los Angeles Police 
Department 
released 

documents about Palantir’s 
surveillance algorithm they 
were using. The result? It 
unveiled the fact that the 
algorithm 
propagates 
the 
disproportionately 
high 
number of arrests of Black 
Angelinos and other minority 
groups. Palantir understood 
the data that it was using 
to develop this algorithm. 
It would had been able to 
predict 
this 
risk. 
But 
it 
didn’t. Until the government 
starts taking action in setting 
restrictions on the data these 
companies use, it is our 
responsibility to understand 
the risks of misusing data. 
It is our responsibility to 
continue questioning these 
companies (maybe even filing 
a 
lawsuit 
against 
them), 
and to consider the ethical 
questions when applying to 
internships.

Thursday, December 6, 2018 — 5A

Though Michigan can only 
have one of freshman Strauss 
Mann 
or 
junior 
Hayden 
Lavigne in the net at a time, 
and a permanent starter may 
emerge among them, the two 
goaltenders continue to forge a 
relationship unique to the two 
 
of them and the position itself.
Yet, 
they 
remain 
in 
competition. 
Lavigne 
and 
Mann are hovering around .500 
with Michigan looking for a 
spark. 
Both netminders have almost 
identical stat lines — 3.28 
goals 
allowed 
against, 177 saves 
and a .881 save 
percentage 
for 
Mann 
compared 
to 3.20, 179, .877 
for Lavigne. Still, 
each player brings 
something unique 
to the table. While 
Mann is more of a 
rangy goaltender 
that wanders out 
of the net, Lavigne prefers to sit 
back patiently in the crease.
“I think goalie is a special 
position,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 
Pearson. 
“With 
forwards you have 15 forwards 
and you play 12 ... It’s a little 
bit different. It’s a unique 
relationship between goalies. 
Goalies are different.”
Pearson’s 
sentiment 
also 
holds true in the way that 
Lavigne and Mann process the 
ups and downs of the game. 

Lavigne is someone who rides 
the waves of his emotions — 
positive or negative — while 
Mann is more straight-lined, 
not having or showing much of 
a reaction to anything.
“Mann’s 
always 
been 
very 
upbeat, 
very 
positive, 
intelligent, 
competitive 
and 
he’s an easy guy to talk to and 
he’s always been that way,” 
Pearson said. “He’s a pretty 
level-headed kid. I don’t think 
he can tell if he’s won a game 
or lost a game. His highs aren’t 
really high, but his lows aren’t 
really low.”
In Michigan’s run to the 
Frozen Four, LaFontaine served 
as 
Lavigne’s 
confidant 
— 
someone 
whose 
shoulder 
he 
could 
lean 
on in spite of 
the 
ongoing 
competition. 
Mann doesn’t 
fulfill 
this 
role, 
and 
shouldn’t 
necessarily. As a freshman, he 
needs time to adjust to college 
hockey and get comfortable 
himself 
at 
Michigan 
— 
something that Lavigne and 
LaFontaine had the luxury of 
doing together.
Rather, 
Mann 
guides 
by 
example more than by direct 
emotional 
support. 
Though 
Mann was thrown into the 
fire in his first start in a 6-5 
loss at Western Michigan and 
withstood a 12-goal offensive 

onslaught to split two starts at 
Penn State, his reaction was no 
different to those games than it 
was in wins.
“I think it’s important to 
show excitement when it’s due, 
but at the same time you have 
to be able to restrain that (non) 
excitement when it’s negative,” 
Lavigne 
said. 
“Looking 
at 
Strauss, that’s something I can 
learn from him, he’s really good 
at just goaltending without 
getting frustrated. There’s stuff 
we can learn from each other, 
and the median between us 
both is the spot that we want to 
try to get to.”
It’s exactly that collaborative 
mindset, though, that keeps 
Mann level-headed in the face 
of the competition and season 
at hand. Sure, it might have 
stung not to get a start in either 
game in the Wisconsin series 
after playing both games in 
State College. He and Lavigne, 
however, 
know 
that 
every 
moment, whether it’s on or off 
the ice, serves as an opportunity 
to help the team out and further 
their respective career arcs.
“The interesting part about 
the goalie-partner relationship 
is that there can only be one guy 
in the net,” Mann said. “So just 
that being a fact, it gets very 
competitive between the two 
goalies, because at the end of 
the day you want to be the one 
in the net. But at the same time, 
you have to realize that your 
career is a journey, and even if 
you’re not playing you can still 
get better in so many ways and 
learn stuff from your partner.”

The kid from somewhere else: 
Cam York commits to Michigan

When Cam York took the ice 
at Yost Ice Arena for the first 
time as a member of the U.S. 
National Team Development 
Program’s U18 team, he didn’t 
know that it would be his 
future home arena.
York 
initially 
committed 
to Boston College back in 
2016, largely because of then-
associate head coach Greg 
Brown. Brown coached the 
defensemen, which drew York 
to the Eagles. When Brown left 
to be an assistant coach for the 
New York Rangers, York went 
looking for other options.
“With 
(Boston 
College) 
losing 
their 
defensive 
head 
coach, 
that was a big 
reason 
why 
I went there 
in 
the 
first 
place, so it was 
disappointing 
to me,” York 
said. 
“I 
decommitted 
from there and 
looked at other options and 
Michigan was the place for me. 
I think with their coaching 
staff and their facilities and 
what they have to offer, I knew 
that Michigan was the right 
choice.”
While 
he 
was 
leaning 
toward Michigan, York was 
still 
uncommitted 
when 
the NTDP played at Yost in 
October.
But it didn’t take too long 
during that game for the crowd 
to show him what Michigan 
hockey is all about.
“I think that was kind of 
the cherry on top,” York said. 
“That’s what kind of sold me, 
for sure. Just the atmosphere 
of that place and just the way 
that Michigan fans support 
their team. It’s a special 

place.”
And 
just 
a 
few 
weeks 
after 
playing 
that 
game, 
York 
officially 
announced 
his 
commitment 
to 
the 
Wolverines. He is Michigan’s 
12th commitment for the class 
of 2019 — a class that ranks 
first in the nation, according 
to Neutral Zone.
York is eligible for the 2019 
NHL Entry Draft, and many 
expect him to be a first-round 
pick. He ranks inside the top 
20 among eligible prospects by 
four of the six major scouting 
websites.
His skill as a two-way 
defenseman is exemplified by 
the fact that he has 16 points in 
22 games this season, as well 
as a plus-minus 
rating of plus-
nine.
The 
NTDP 
has sent quite 
a 
few 
players 
to 
join 
the 
college 
ranks 
at Michigan in 
the 
past 
few 
years, including 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Quinn Hughes and sophomore 
forward Josh Norris. York’s 
class seems to be no exception, 
as 
he 
and 
forward 
John 
Beecher are set to join the 
Wolverines next fall.

“We’re super excited,” York 
said. “Me and (Beecher) have 
become pretty good friends 
here. He’s a really good player, 
so I’m really excited to be able 
to play with him at the college 
hockey level.”
In 
addition 
to 
playing 
with his current teammate, 
York is also excited to play 
for a team that has such 
widespread support. Hailing 
from Anaheim Hills, Calif. 
— not exactly a hotbed for 
hockey — the fervor with 
which Michigan fans support 
the Wolverines was one of the 
first things he noticed when he 
started thinking about coming 
to Michigan, even outside Yost 
Ice Arena.
“You 
see 
guys 
wearing 
Michigan 
hoodies, 
there’s 
Michigan on license plates 
and stuff like that,” York said. 
“The state of Michigan just 
supports their team so much 
and I think that’s something 
that I really noticed and was 
really drawn to as a kid from 
somewhere else.”
If York gets drafted as high 
as he’s expected to be this 
summer, he’ll take the ice for 
the Wolverines next year with 
plenty of attention. 
Those Michigan fans he’s 
so drawn to will have their 
eyes on him — the kid from 
somewhere else.

Lerg, Rosens lead ‘M’ to Sweet 16

As the Michigan volleyball 
team’s bench rushed onto the 
court to join the dogpile, head 
coach Mark Rosen jolted out of 
his seat. His wife, associate head 
coach Leisa Rosen, threw her 
right fist into the air.
Their slew of reactions came 
in the moment the Wolverines 
(24-9 overall, 11-9 Big Ten) 
clinched their berth in the Sweet 
Sixteen with an upset win over 
No. 12 Pittsburgh (30-2 overall, 
17-1 ACC).
Saturday’s 
win 
adds 
yet 
another jewel to Mark and Leisa 
Rosen’s coaching crown — one 
that 
already 
included 
nine 
All-Americans, 17 postseason 
appearances 
and 
over 
400 
victories in their tenure in 
Ann Arbor. The Rosens’ most 
recent achievement marks their 
seventh trip to the Sweet Sixteen 
in 20 years at the helm of the 
program.
But that’s merely a number to 
them.
“I don’t keep track of those 
things,” Mark Rosen said. “I 
just like the fact that we’re in 
the Sweet Sixteen. It’s a great 
accomplishment for this team, 
but we want to go farther. We’re 
not satisfied — we want to go win 
the next one.”
To get there, the Rosens first 
had to get through Navy, which 
presented Michigan with the 
challenge of an unconventional 
style in the opening round. The 
Mids (23-9 overall, 13-3 Patriot 
League) won their conference 
title, highlighted by the one-
dimensional offense they used 
to cruise through the regular 
season. Outside hitter Maddi 
Sgattoni finished the season 
with 
1,288 
attack 
attempts, 
over 540 more than any of her 
teammates.
After facing six of the AVCA 
Coaches Poll’s top-12 teams in 
its regular season Big Ten slate, 
the Wolverines had adapted to 
seeing 
well-versed 
offensive 
attacks. Adjusting to Navy’s one-
woman show posed a challenge, 
but the Rosens put a defensive 
scheme in place to neutralize 

Sgattoni’s skill set. Michigan 
executed 
the 
gameplan 
to 
perfection, holding Sgattoni to 
two kills on 36 attempts while 
forcing her into seven errors.
The player responsible for 
spearheading the Wolverines’ 
adjusted defensive effort was 
senior libero Jenna Lerg, but 
that’s nothing new. Now in her 
fourth year as a starter, the 
Michigan native recorded 18 digs 
in the opening-round match. In 
the midst of making dramatic 
one-armed saves look routine, 
Lerg recorded the 1,927th dig 
of her career 
— a feat which 
moved her into 
second place on 
the 
program’s 
all-time list.
“(Lerg) 
is 
arguably 
the 
best 
libero 
we’ve ever had,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“She’s great at 
the whole game. 
We can look at records, but it 
really comes down to how she 
impacts this team. She elevates 
the level of this team, and that’s 
huge for us. She comes up in 
big points, and her skill set can 
change the momentum of the 
entire match.”
The sweep of Navy set up 
a showdown with Pittsburgh, 
the ACC champion. Squaring 
off against a 30-win conference 
champion on its home court in 
the Big Dance can be daunting, 
so the Rosens went back to the 
drawing board to craft another 
thoughtful approach.
One five-set thriller later, the 

Wolverines were off to the Sweet 
Sixteen.
On his way to shake hands 
with 
Pittsburgh 
coach 
Dan 
Fisher 
at 
midcourt, 
Mark 
Rosen walked by his coaching 
binder, which sat untouched 
on Michigan’s bench. Rather 
than continuing his journey to 
Fisher, Rosen stopped, doubled 
back to his seat, and grabbed his 
binder — a choice emblematic 
of his task-oriented approach to 
coaching.
The next task at hand? No. 
5-seed Texas (22-4 overall, 17-1 
Big 12).
Rather 
than 
taking 
time 
out 
of 
the 
upcoming 
week 
to commemorate 
the victory, the 
Rosens will be 
studying film on 
the 
Longhorns. 
The battle will 
take 
place 
on 
Brigham Young’s 
campus in Provo, Utah on Friday 
afternoon.
“We need to figure out how 
to advance past each team we 
play,” Rosen said. “It’s not about 
playing pretty volleyball, it’s 
about advancing to the next 
round.”
If the Wolverines can upend 
Texas, it’d mark Michigan’s third 
Elite Eight appearance of the 
Rosen era — further etching their 
names into program history. As 
their coaching resume continues 
to grow, the Rosens’ legacy 
begins to approach immortality.
To Mark and Leisa, it’s just 
one more task.

Michigan ready for LIU-Brooklyn

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team returns to Crisler 
Center on Thursday night for the 
first time in a long time.
After 
a 
two-and-a-half-week 
stretch which saw the Wolverines 
travel from Estero, Fla., to Raleigh, 
N.C. and back north to Milwaukee, 
Wisc., they are finally coming home.
Michigan faced four ranked 
opponents over the course of their 
travels — No. 21 Missouri, No. 10 
Texas, No. 13 NC State and No. 
22 Marquette — earning only one 
victory against the Tigers. In the 
other three games, the Wolverines’ 
youth 
and 
weaknesses 
were 
exploited.
“We 
really, 
really 
tested 
ourselves,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico to 1050 WKTA. 
“The travel has been the toughest 
part for our young kids. It felt like 
we were on an NBA schedule.”
Though 
the 
Longhorns 
and Golden Eagles thoroughly 
outplayed the Wolverines, the 
game against NC State remained 
competitive until the end — despite 
an 11-point loss.
“NC State is a great team,” 
Barnes-Arico said. “It was really a 
great basketball game until the end. 

And I think the atmosphere there 
was incredible. For our young kids 
to be in that environment, on the 
road, in the ACC, with the crowd 
getting into it like they did — that 
will really prepare us for Big Ten 
play.”
If Michigan had pulled off that 
victory, it would be returning home 
much more pleased with it current 
position. Instead a 5-3 record 
through eight games looms over 
the Wolverines, as they now have 
their first real chance to practice 
since they left Ann Arbor on 
Thanksgiving.
Challenging itself — especially 
early in the season — may reap 
benefits come the end of the year for 
Michigan, but as the Big Ten season 
inches closer, simply stringing 
together a few wins would be 
helpful.
The Wolverines should have this 
chance on Thursday night when 
LIU-Brooklyn arrives in Ann Arbor. 
The struggling Blackbirds are 0-7, 
failing to score over 50 points in 
three of those games.
LIU guards Brandy Thomas and 
Jeydah Johnson will likely pose the 
biggest threats offensively, but a lack 
of size gives Michigan a significant 
advantage in the paint. Similarly, 
the Blackbirds have struggled to 
stop teams defensively, giving up 

over 70 points to Fairfield, St. Peter’s 
and UC Irvine.
So the Wolverines seem quite 
capable of making this one ugly.
Still, Michigan has a few kinks 
to iron out itself. Freshman point 
guard Amy Dilk and senior center 
Hallie Thome — both key starters 
for the Wolverines — have struggled 
in recent weeks. The speed of the 
game may be catching up to Dilk, 
while for Thome, consistent double-
teams have rendered her somewhat 
ineffective offensively. Look for 
both of them to rebound against a 
team that has struggled as much as 
LIU.
Additionally, 
a 
return 
to 
Michigan’s home-court advantage 
should help it after its long stretch 
away.
“We feel like it’s been so long 
since we’ve been home and had 
an opportunity to play in front of 
our home crowd,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Really we always talk about 
protecting that block ‘M’, so our 
kids are super excited about that 
aspect.
“More so than any opponent 
right now, I think it’s about us 
getting better. This road swing has 
shown us what the best teams in 
the country look like. Now it’s an 
opportunity to work on Michigan, 
and where we need to improve.”

Senior center Hallie Thome has struggled lately as Michigan has dropped three of its last four games, all on the road.

Ignas Brazdeikis came through when 
the Wolverines needed him the most

The 
Michigan 
basketball 
team’s trip to Northwestern 
on Tuesday night was not 
supposed to be the toughest 
challenge of its young season.
But with five minutes to play, 
it had become just that. Every 
time the Wolverines threatened 
to pull away, the Wildcats 
reeled back within striking 
distance. Leads of 10, 15 and 
10 were matched with a trio of 
Northwestern scoring runs.
Most 
teams 
would 
turn 
to a veteran presence in that 
moment of adversity. Michigan, 
on the surface, should be no 
different. Seven members of its 
eight-man rotation were here 
last year, when the Wolverines 
won 14 straight games en route 
to the national title game. 
Despite not having any seniors, 
experience is not among this 
team’s limited weaknesses.
Yet, when its undefeated 
season lay in the balance for the 
first time, Michigan called on 
its sole contributing freshman. 
And as he has done so often 
this season, that freshman — 
forward Ignas Brazdeikis, in 
case you haven’t been paying 
attention — came through for 
the Wolverines, rattling home a 
3-pointer to break a six-minute 
scoring drought and erase their 

first second-half deficit in more 
than three weeks.
“He gets us buckets when 
we can’t get one sometimes,” 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
said of Brazdeikis. “… He 
makes such obvious freshmen 
mistakes sometimes, … and 
then, all of a sudden, he’ll just 
go get you a bucket.”
When Northwestern scored 
seven straight in the first half 
to draw within three, it was 
Brazdeikis who took the ball 
at the top of the key, charged 
toward the hoop and nailed 
a 
left-handed 
floater. 
One 
possession later, the Wildcats’ 
defense 
crowded 
the 
lane, 
forcing him into a fadeaway 
jumper from an impossible 
angle. Nothing but net.
“That’s why he came to 
Michigan,” Beilein said. “He 
watched Nik Stauskas make 
a lot of those big shots and he 
wanted to be in this element 
and play in front of that crowd 
today. That’s who he is and 
that’s why we love him.”
After 
taking 
a 
36-30 
lead 
into 
the 
break, 
the 
Wolverines’ offense began to 
wilt. Sophomore guard Zavier 
Simpson, Michigan’s on-court 
leader, followed an eight-point 
first half by going 1-of-6 from 
the field in the second. As 
Simpson’s struggles reached 
their apex, junior center Jon 

Teske had to sit with foul 
trouble. His backup — redshirt 
sophomore center Austin Davis 
— posted zero points, three 
fouls and a negative-9 plus-
minus in just seven minutes.
But whenever his teammates 
faltered, 
Brazdeikis 
shone 
brightest, 
keeping 
the 
Wolverines afloat by scoring 
12 of their first 18 points of the 
second half and assisting on 
two more.
“We got knocked down, but 
I feel like this game brought 
us more together,” Brazdeikis 
said. “I feel like we grew a lot, 
and it showed how tough we 
are.”
Before 
the 
season, 
most 
would have anticipated the 
Wolverines to call on redshirt 
junior 
forward 
Charles 
Matthews or sophomore guard 
Jordan Poole in an imposing 
late-game road environment. 
Matthews was deemed to be 
the team’s most NBA-ready 
player and Poole had been 
there before, saving Michigan’s 
2018 season with his now-
immortalized buzzer-beater.
Instead, 
those 
two 
epitomized 
Michigan’s 
struggles down the stretch, 
combining for just four second-
half points.
In their place stepped a 
freshman. Even if he makes 
that detail easy to forget.

DESIGN BY SHERRY CHEN


Sometimes, when we step 
away from our conventional 
wisdoms 
about 
the 
way 
something must work, we are 
able to realize true beauty lies 
not in the intricate but the 
familiar. Start by going back to 
your roots and exploring the 
implausible ways the simple 
can be rendered magnificent. 
At Spencer, the small but fierce 
32-seat 
restaurant 
on 
Ann 
Arbor’s East Liberty Street, 
the philosophy is a unique 
one, and one that we typically 
don’t see at restaurants in 
Michigan, or anywhere at all. 
The restaurant, or “passion 
project,” as co-owner Abby 
Olitzky calls it, is the love child 
of San Francisco-born pastry 
chef Olitzky and Ann Arbor 
native 
cheesemonger 
Steve 
Hall. The two met in California 
at the cheese and wine shop at 
which Hall was working when 
Olitzky happened to stop by to 
purchase cheese one day. After 
a few months, they decided to 
move to Michigan to open a 
restaurant. Upon returning to 
Hall’s Burns Park roots, Olitzky 
fell in love with Ann Arbor and 
they began searching for a 
location which is now the chic, 
cozy spot Spencer calls home.
Olitzky is the main chef at 
Spencer, and Hall handles the 
wine and most of the front of 
house business. The two work 
together to make an endearing, 
charming 
and 
dedicated 
partnership. The two cooperate 

along with other sous-chefs to 
craft the restaurant’s unique 
menu items. The diverse and 
interesting menu is only one 
facet 
of 
Spencer’s 
quirky, 
daring personality. On any 
given day, the menu can change 
based on what is in season, or 
simply what Olitzky feels the 
Ann Arbor community should 
taste that day.
“The 
menu 
is 
always 
changing, because I get bored 
sometimes. I want to come 
into work and keep things 
interesting and play around 
with 
all 
of 
the 
potential 
flavors,” Olitzky said in an 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily about the unorthodox 
conditional characteristic of 
the menu, always ready to 
change as seasonal ingredients 
or Olitzky’s creative urges 
do. Currently, the menu is 
dotted with brussels sprouts 
accompanied 
by 
grapefruit, 
chili 
peanut 
and 
burrata, 
which to my dismay Olitzky 
advised me is being ushered off 
the menu in the next few days 
because brussels sprouts are 
heading out of season.
“Our style is what I like to 
call California Cuisine, sort of 
a European cooking style with 
local ingredients. It’s all about 
the local ingredients, though; 
we try to make them shine 
through and fuss as little as 
possible,” Olitzky said.
Locally 
sourced 
food 
means a lot to the team at 
Spencer. Olitzky buys all the 
ingredients at the Ann Arbor 
Farmers Market and from a 
few other farmers working 
on 
biodynamic 
or 
organic 
growing practices with whom 
she’s 
forged 
relationships. 
Certain 
idiosyncrasies, 
like 
going the extra mile to find the 
freshest ingredients and using 
creative collaboration to put 
a remarkable twist on simple 

dishes is what makes Spencer 
so solitary in its glory.
“When I talk to the farmers 
about what vegetables we’re 
getting, I always try to search 
for ingredients we can treat as 
whole or as individual. I don’t 
want to mash up vegetables 
or take them far away from 
how I receive them. I want 
to showcase an ingredient 
as whole. The biggest part of 
cooking to me is that you have 
to have a voice that’s yours 
and only yours,” Olitzky said 
about her own culinary voice, 
one that feels authentic and 
focused on the ingredients 
and the way they can bring 
out the best in one another. 
Through her education and 
experiences 
cooking, 
she’s 
seen many different kitchens 
and had the ability to work in 
many different environments, 
all of which inform the way she 
cooks now — straight from the 
heart and with the beauty of 
the ingredient in mind.
Everything about Spencer 
is real and genuine, from the 
folks behind the magic, to 
the interior design. Daylight 
spills through the large glass 
windows at the front, warming 
the communal wooden tables 
and filling the place with a 
sunny serenity. The interior is 
decorated with fresh flowers 
and overgrown green plants, 
oil paintings and a cool brick 
wall, all fitting perfectly with 
the black and white tiled 
floors to create a homey yet 
simple vibe. The authenticity 
of Spencer’s personality comes 

from Olitzky, who is a firm 
believer in being true to herself 
when she cooks.
“We don’t change who we 
are when we cook, ever. Out 
best food comes out here when 
I’m the most authentic to who 
I am,” Olitzky said. She started 
out at New York University 
taking different classes on 
ingredients and food, and from 
there went on to the Institute 
of 
Culinary 
Education 
to 
hone her craft in cooking. She 
decided to head back home 
to San Francisco to pursue 
a career in cooking before 
meeting Hall and moving to 
Ann Arbor. Now, she can be 
found in the kitchen at Spencer 
six nights a week, though she’s 
been trying to take an extra day 
off, trusting her predominately 
female sous-chefs to cultivate 
their own unique culinary 
voices while keeping true to 
Spencer’s mission and mantra.
“As an individual, I want my 
cooking to feel personal and I 
want everyone who works in 
this kitchen to feel like they 
have a personal style as well,” 
she said. And personally it does 
feel as if all of the menu items at 
Spencer seem to tell their own 
story, as though they are not 
only dishes but entities with 
personas and significance. The 
team behind Spencer’s creative 
mind takes a dish like short rib 
and embellishes it with gusto, 
adding 
a 
pancake, 
pickled 
cauliflower and horseradish. 
They 
take 
pierogies 
and 
investigate new flavor profiles 
by adding arugula, sunflower, 
beet mostrada and caraway 
crème fraîche. While intricate, 
the dishes start with simple 
ingredients 
that 
mingle 
together 
to 
create 
flavor 
breakthroughs.
“I’m in the kitchen all the 
time,” Olitzky said. “I literally 
refuse to leave the kitchen. 

But that’s just how I like it. It’s 
easier for me to have women 
in the kitchen because I don’t 
communicate 
as 
forcefully 
or directly as other chefs, so 
oftentimes women gravitate 
toward my style. It’s hard to 
find people with the same 
ethos about cooking and have 
my 
same 
mentality 
about 
staying fresh and seasonal and 
focusing on the ingredient.”
In the major kitchens of 
New York City, men dominate 
the creative recipe building 
and physical act of cooking, 
making 
the 
restaurant 
industry a hard one to break 
into as a woman. Being taken 
seriously in a major kitchen as 
a woman is incredibly difficult 
in commercial kitchens, where 
the patriarchy reigns. Just this 
past week, Dominique Crenn 
became the first woman in the 
United States to earn three 
Michelin stars, a distinguished 
honor for chefs. One may 
wonder 
how 
many 
other 
women also deserve the same 
honor but have had a more 
difficult time making it in the 
business.
“I worked for Dominique 
Crenn once,” Olitzky said. “It 
was like for a day. I was very 
young, and I was like… what is 
going on.”
“I’d like to say that it’s 
changing — that traditionally 
women cook to feed and are 
seen 
cooking 
in 
domestic 
kitchens 
and 
that 
we’re 
changing 
that, 
but 
really 
there isn’t much of a change 
in the industry,” she admitted, 

referencing 
the 
dichotomy 
between male and female chefs 
and restaurateurs. But Olitzky 
is part of the group looking to 
break the curve, commanding 
the culinary world fearlessly, 
marching to the beat of her 
own drum.
Behind 
the 
counter 
is 
Olitzky’s 
bookshelf 
of 
cookbooks — she’s constantly 
collecting 
cookbooks 
and 
reading different female chefs’ 
recipe books. The stacks of 
books may look like vintage 
decor, but really they’re a huge 
piece of Olitzky’s identity as a 
restauranteur and foodie. As 
we chat, her personal recipe 
book sits open in front of her — a 
Moleskine bursting with notes 
and papers, scribbled with 
her newest ideas, ingredient 
pairings and reminders. She 
etches “green things” into the 
margins as she remembers 
to put in an order for green 
veggies and brussels sprouts to 
one of the farmers with which 
she generally does business.
“I think in my future I 
want to write cookbooks,” 
Olitzky said. “I love reading 
cookbooks and food writing, 
and I really want to create one 
of my own.” She would follow 
her heart and intuition with 
the cookbook as well, and I 
would hope it would also be 
embellished with photographs, 
as the food at Spencer is not 
only a unique gastronomic 
experience, but also incredibly 
visually attractive. As seen on 
Instagram feeds every day, 
the moment that a plate of 
warm food is placed in front 
of a diner at a restaurant like 
Spencer is supplemented by a 
flurry of phone screens ready 
for a picture-worthy moment.
The food at Spencer is 
colorful and jubilant — a 
celebration of ingredients and 
the simple joys of life.

The wondrous culinary delights of Spencer Ann Arbor

B-SIDE LEAD

“I cook how I want to eat; I 
like to make a ton of different 
things and share all of it,” she 
said. “I don’t really believe in 
tapas and small plates. I hate 
those words. I cook here how 
I cook at home. Many smaller 
items, different things and 
options.”
Olitzky’s identity in cooking 
stemmed from when she was 
young and would take trips to 
the farmer’s market with her 
mother. Olitzky said she never 
stopped 
cooking, 
especially 
when she was training and 
being educated as a young chef. 
She was always in the kitchen, 
using her hands.
“Sometimes people ask me 
why we’re so successful here, 
and I say there’s no secret. 
I just don’t care to cater to 
anybody. I just cook what I 
want to cook.”
When 
Olitzky 
gets 
in 
the kitchen at Spencer, she 
submerges herself in a world 
where she focuses on herself 
as the chef, and the ingredients 
as her tools. Working from the 
inside out, she uses the plate 
as a mirror, reflecting her own 
identity through the dishes she 
curates. Removing the third 
party — in this case the patron 
— for a moment to focus on her 
own culinary style is a risk, 
but it is one that works in her 
favor. Spencer is packed every 
night of the week. The team’s 
commitment to its authentic 
backbone 
is 
what 
brings 
customers back time and time 
again.
“I used to come home from 
a long work day in the kitchen 
and decide to cook myself 
dinner instead of just grabbing 
something 
to-go,” 
Olitzky 
said. “I would have one day off 
in a week, and I’d spend the 
entirety of it recipe testing and 
cooking.” Olitzky’s dedication 
and commitment to the food 
she flirts with and Hall’s 
passion for wine and customer 
service make the most ideal 
pairing.
Every Tuesday in December, 
the 
pair 
transform 
the 
restaurant into a wine store 
for the afternoon. The bottles 
are organized by region, and 
the flexibility of the space 
allows 
for 
creativity. 
The 
Tuesday Wine Pop-Up Shop 
is accompanied by a food 
component, 
because 
wine 
should always be embellished 
with food. In fact, Olitzky 
was 
tasked 
with 
making 
homemade latkes for the event 
coming up a few hours after 
our conversation. The latkes 
turned out crispy and beautiful, 
as can be seen on Spencer’s 
Instagram 
promoting 
the 

wine 
event. 
This 
type 
of 
event doesn’t just happen in 
December; Olitzky and Hall 
are always coming up with new 
ways to spice things up.
“We have ticketed events, 
like wine and food events where 
we focus on a specific topic or 
region all the time,” Olitzky 
said. “We love to transform 
our space, do something fun 
and keep ourselves on our toes. 
We’re here to feed people in 
the community and to hope 
they latch on and get excited 
about the things we are excited 
by.”
Intimacy 
underlies 
everything 
Spencer 
does, 
from customer service, to the 
communal tables that invite 

people to share a meal with 
one another, and the intricate 
details in the dishes. There 
is never any removal from 
the food at Spencer. Each 
dish touches the hands of the 
talented chefs and is delivered 
to the customer, never falling 
away from its base of being 
an ingredient that was grown 
and curated from the earth. At 
Spencer, Olitzky and Hall have 
created a space for a rare and 
intimate relationship between 
food and creator, customer 
and creator, and customer and 
food.
“I like using my hands a lot, 
and I’m so obsessed with the 
meditative quality of being 
mindful while cooking: It is so 
focused in thought,” Olitzky 
said.
What makes Spencer’s heart 
beat is its earnest return to 
the 
simple 
and 
traditional 
coupled with the charisma and 
identity of a young, punchy 
go-getter always in the market 

to try something new. The 
restaurant’s personality did 
not manifest itself as such a 
dynamic 
individual, 
rather, 
the minds behind its character 
are what makes it so special. 
Hall and Olitzky are recently 
married and navigating the 
world of being in a romantic 
relationship while also being 
business partners.
“I can’t imagine opening 
a 
restaurant 
alone,without 
a partner who is personally 
involved with me somehow, 
even a family member or 
something,” 
Olitzky 
said. 
“Steve always has my best 
interest at heart. He’s always 
thinking about me first. If I 
was partners with someone 
who wasn’t invested in my best 
interest, I’d be worried about 
what’s holding them there and 
what’s preventing them from 
thinking about me as a person 
first.”
Hall and Olitzky share the 
same 
mantras 
and 
beliefs 
about food and the culinary 
world, another reason their 
partnership seems to work so 
pleasantly, and in Spencer’s 
favor.
“We don’t really see food 
as art,” Olitzky said. “The 
importance of food as art is 
being inflated and glamorized. 
At the end of the day it’s really 
a simple thing: It’s just food. 
I see food as a practice. As a 
belief. As a meditation.”
When 
asked 
about 
the 
possibility of opening another 
restaurant, Olitzky explained 
“There’s no rush for us to go 
anywhere 
from 
here 
right 
now, there’s no pressure to 
have to open someplace new 
just because that’s what other 
people do. We can keep pushing 
ourselves here. We can hone in 
and be creative here. We are 
not there yet, and that’s OK.”
Spencer is a delight. It is 
creative, and it is pushing 
boundaries. 
It 
is 
breaking 
barriers 
and 
building 
new 
walls. It is a shimmering gem in 
a world of commercial kitchens 
so focused on what’s next. 
It is a clear bell in a world of 
kitchens forgetting about the 
simple, forfeiting the beauty 
of the moment for the big 
picture. What Olitzky and Hall 
have done at Spencer is taken 
their hearts, their love for 
one another and their love for 
the world of food and created 
sustenance out of it. Anyone 
who 
walks 
into 
Spencer’s 
charming front door is in for an 
experience where the unique 
taking on simple ingredients 
all tells a story, and that in and 
of itself is the most wonderful 
dish a restaurant can serve.

The sweet tooth: society’s 
colloquial term to describe 
our sudden craving for sweets. 
Yet, the term almost comes 
with a hint of shame, as the 
sweet tooth tends to hit us 

hardest when we’re feeling a 
little stressed, a little down or 
maybe even just a little bored. 
Especially as students, we all 
relate to the sudden cravings 
that come with long study 
periods and academic/work 
stress.
So what better solutions 
do we have to this epidemic 
desire for the processed and 
carb-loaded? 
Here 
enters 
GoNanas, 
the 
brainchild 
of 
School 
of 
Information 
senior Annie Slabotski and 
LSA senior Morgan Lerner. 
GoNanas produces a variety of 
banana breads, all gluten-free 
(many vegan friendly as well) 
that replace all the negative 
ingredients 
associated 
with 
baked desserts with the kind 

of stuff that packs a much more 
nutritious punch, all detailed 
by Slabotski in an interview 
with The Daily.
“All of our breads are made 
from the exact same base. 
Instead of using refined wheat 
flour we use whole grain 
gluten-free oat flour, which is 
packed with fiber and a bunch 

of nutrients that are wonderful 
for you; and then instead of 
butter or canola oil we use 
coconut oil; instead of sour 
cream we use coconut milk,” 
Slabotski explained. “So every 
quote-unquote bad ingredient 
that you find within an average 
banana bread we substitute for 
something that is the better 
version for you.”
But GoNanas hasn’t always 
been supplying places like 
Fred’s, Replenish and Literati 
with their delicious breads. 
Like 
all 
small 
businesses, 
Slabotski and Lerner started 
out as freshman with a simple 
goal in mind: “We’re really 
driven by our mission in this 
idea that we can bring healthy, 
accessible food to busy college 
kids that are on the go and 
want to have a dessert but 
don’t want to grab a donut or 
a refined sugar-filled muffin. 
So we want to give this treat — 
especially to those people who 
are vegan or gluten-free or 
nut-free or dairy-free, we are 
all allergen-free — and being 

able to provide this healthy, 
nutritious 
dessert 
is 
what 
inspires us,” Slabotski said.
Slabotski and Lerner met 
as freshman year neighbors 
in their dorm, and sharing 
a common interest in food, 
Slabotski asked her neighbor 
if she wanted to go back 
to 
her 
parents’ 
house 
to 
do some baking. And upon 
mentioning that her family has 
urged her to sell her banana 
bread, 
Lerner 
responded 
enthusiastically, and the rest 
is history: “We went home, and 
we took a mixture of the recipe 
I knew from my mom and 
some healthy recipes that we 
found online and just started 
experimenting. 
We 
pretty 
much just threw something 

together in a mixing bowl, 
stuck it in the oven and burnt 
the whole thing. I mean it was 
charred. And we were like why 
don’t we just cut off the top? 
It’ll be super dry, but we can 
try it. And it was so good, and 
we thought, ‘If we can burn the 
crap out of this thing and it still 
tastes amazing, we really have 

something.’ So we spent the 
summer perfecting the recipe, 
talking to people, making sure 
they liked it, getting feedback 
and then we had some help 
developing the website and 
were open for business the 
next school year.”
What 
is 
most 
appealing 
about GoNanas is not only the 
nutritional value of their work, 
but also the variety they bring 
to an otherwise standard treat, 
with current flavors including 
pumpkin and chocolate chip 
— and with this variety brings 
a sustainable edge to their 
company. GoNanas works with 
the seasons provide fresh new 
flavors 
to 
their 
customers 
while keeping in mind how 
they can make a positive 
environmental 
impact 
with 
their food.
“When 
we’re 
exploring 
to find new flavors, we get 
inspired by the season. So 
right now we have pumpkin 
because it’s fall, but we’re 
transitioning into an apple-
cinnamon 
because 
apples 

are really well harvested in 
the winter, and a lot of our 

mission goes into food waste,” 
Slabotski explained. “We get a

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘MODEL HOMES’

I’ve been anxiously 
awaiting the unlikely return 
of David Bazan-helmed Pedro 
The Lion since my youth 
pastor played “Diamond Ring” 
as the introduction to a lesson 
at our fall kick-off retreat 
my sophomore year of high 
school.
For those unfamiliar with 
Bazan’s work, as Pedro or 
otherwise, the publication 
Christ and Pop Culture might 
have put it best when they 
labeled him the “Patron Saint 
of Skeptics and Doubters.” 
Early in his career as Pedro, 
Bazan found a serious 
fan base among religious 
communities, who presumably 
just appreciated he was 
talking about God at all. As 
the albums kept coming (five 
LPs in total between 1998 and 
2004, with the addition of 
Phoenix coming in January 
of next year) Bazan’s lyrics 
became more and more 

cynical. Around that time, he 
also expressed in interviews 
that he had begun considering 
himself agnostic and, as a 
direct result, became a sort of 
black sheep among those in 

the Christian community who 
were aware of his work.
Now, although Bazan 
appears to be making a 
conscious turn away from 
explicitly religious themes, 
he can’t quite seem to make a 
clean break. “Model Homes,” 
the second single from the 
upcoming Phoenix, finds him 
still hinting at the stifling 
quality of the church. The 
song opens with Bazan, as a 
child, leaving church with his 
parents, an image followed by 

the reflection that “Sunday 
afternoon felt like a tomb.”
Largely, though, “Model 
Homes” expresses a wish for 
newness. Over melancholy, 
sun-soaked guitars, Bazan 
blurs the line between past 
and present, juxtaposing 
images of “Shuffling our shoes 
on brand new carpet / Freeze 
tag with static electricity,” 
with a desire to “Live with 
someone else / Give them my 
whole self.” What begins in 
childhood makes a startling 
jump to the present day, 
while Bazan half-shouts, “I 
wanna not be lonely,” in his 
characteristically syrupy vocal 
style. “When will the wait be 
over?” he repeats twice at the 
end of the song. For fans of 
Pedro, the wait will be over 
sooner than we know.

Replenish or small grocers who 
have over ripe bananas that 
they can’t sell. We’re hopeful 
to do that with this potential 
new flavor because a lot of 
apples get bruised and then 
are not able to be sold. Trying 
to reduce that food waste as 
well is something we try to 
incorporate into our breads.”
With an eye on health and 
sustainability, 
GoNanas 
is 
the perfect one-two punch 
of 
a 
delicious, 
sustainable 
snack without all the negative 
effects of typical, dessert-like 
foods. Starting with a family 
recipe, Slabotski and Lerner 
are pioneering what it means 
to satisfy a sweet tooth in a 
fast-paced, 
health-conscious 
society — especially one in a 
huge college town. With an eye 
at expanding their clientele 
in the future, Slabotski also 
reflected on the unique quality 
of their bread.

“I think it’s just a really 
unique product. I’ve never 
seen an on-the-go treat like 
that, and I think that we get 
a call maybe once every two 
weeks, once a month, from 
someone 
thanking 
us 
for 
bringing a gluten-free treat, 
or a vegan-treat, that’s not so 
expensive, that’s healthy and 
tastes good. So I think that 
it’s super rewarding to do 
something that you believe in. 
And I think that’s why we’ve 
done it for so long, and why we 
want to continue doing it.”
Next time you’re in a mild 
state of panic reviewing your 
organic chemistry notes or 
slamming out a paper on 
the role of carriages in Jane 
Austen, think about grabbing a 
slice of GoNanas bread before 
running to Walgreens for a 
candy bar — your body and 
mind will definitely thank you 
for it.

Yet, the term 
almost comes 
with a hint of 
shame, as the 
sweet tooth tends 
to hit us hardest 
when we’re 
feeling a little 
stressed, a little 
down or maybe 
even a little bored.

“...Being able 
to provide this 
healthy, nutritious 
dessert is what 
inspires us... ”

“So I think 
that it’s super 
rewarding to do 
something that 
you believe in. 
And I think that’s 
why we’ve done it 
for so long, and we 
want to contiue 
doing it.”

Veganism in Ann Arbor

I dove head first into veganism 
when I came to the University 
my freshman year. There were 
no vegetarian training wheels 
to ease me into a major lifestyle 
transition of no animal products 
whatsoever. For those who aren’t 
familiar with the “eat food not 
friends” mantra, vegans don’t 
eat any animal-made products, 
including milk, eggs, any kind of 
meat, honey and a jumble of other 
animal-originating 
produce. 
There are many variations to 
the vegan lifestyle, like whole-
starch, low-fat vegans and raw 

vegans who don’t eat anything 
cooked. Beyond food, vegans do 
not wear clothing derived from 
animals, like wool, leather or 
fur. Definitely no Canada Goose 
jackets.
Surprisingly, 
transitioning 
into veganism didn’t feel like 
that big of a deal for me. My diet 
had already largely consisted 
of vegetables, fruits and all the 
heart-healthy grains, and I knew 
there was no way in hell I was 
going to eat chicken-something-
sketchy at the dining hall.
I honestly was not entirely 
informed 
on 
the 
medical, 
ethical, anatomical, economical 
and environmental reasoning 

behind the vegan lifestyle. I just 
felt like it was the right thing to 
do at the time and have stuck 
with it for over a year. But now 
looking into it, there’s so much 
logic behind veganism, not only 
for personal well-being, but 
for the viability of the Earth 
and every living creature on 
it 
(watch 
any 
documentary 
featuring 
innocent 
animals 
being brutally slaughtered in 
extensive quantities to learn 
more).
The traditional Ann Arbor 
culture is rooted in an earthy, 
liberal arts scene: the perfect 
climate for vegan restaurants 
to thrive. I would appoint

How Weird Al kept food 
parody fresh, farm-grade

There is a years-old adage 
that has been spoken by every 
mother 
throughout 
history 
at least once, with a scowl on 
her face and a look of disgust: 
Don’t play with your food. It’s 
a simple ask, but for a child, 
the utmost restraint must be 
used to keep themselves from 
sticking stuff into potatoes 
or making rice mountains on 
their 
plates, 
pushing 
their 
green beans into patterns on 
the white porcelain. Though 
the conventions of etiquette 
don’t allow for any untethered 
experimentation at the dinner 
table, the frustrated parents 
of wild children are missing 
out on one undeniable truth: 
Food is funny. The need to eat 
is something we all have in 
common, and in that universal 
appeal is an opportunity for 
truly great comedy. No one 
knows this more or does it 
better than cultural icon and 
master of parody “Weird Al” 
Yankovic.
Weird 
Al, 
really 
named 
Alfred Yankovic, began his 
path into parody stardom in 
the late ‘70s and quickly grew 
into a media phenomenon. If 
you’ve ever seen a picture of 
him you would not forget it, 
with long curly hair and an 
ultra-expressive mug that only 
enhances 
his 
showmanship. 
The man is a natural comedian, 
and it’s obvious to anyone 
who watches his music videos 
or appearances on late-night 
television. He’s a well-loved and 
lauded character in American 
and world media alike, someone 
who has been creating songs 
that parody pop culture and art 
with an intelligent edge for over 
40 years. For those not familiar 
with Weird Al’s work, it’s worth 
a listen from hits like “Amish 
Paradise,” an Amish-themed 
version of the late-‘90s hit 
“Gangsta’s Paradise,” to “White 
and Nerdy,” a geeky take on 
“Ridin’ Dirty,” the songwriter 
has tackled every genre and era 
of music with flourish and the 
kind of smart satire that sneaks 
up on you through expertly 
arranged jams.
Weird Al has been a solid 
presence in the American pop 
media through these parodies 
for decades, taking on the 

conventions and hits of each 
time period with a consistently 
funny and unique take. But the 
thing that he has always done 
best, even in the large scope of 
his celebrated career, is craft 
whimsically 
hilarious 
songs 
about food. He even released 
an album titled The Food Album 
in 1993, a collection of his best 
songs based on the silliness and 
convention of the things we eat. 
In fact, Weird Al’s first song 
that played on the radio was his 
version of classic ‘70s rock hit 

“My Sharona,” affectionately 
titled “My Bologna.” “Ooh, 
my little hungry one, hungry 
one / Open up a package 
of 
my 
bologna,” 
he 
sings, 
crooning over a ragged guitar 
part. 
Although 
Weird 
Al’s 
songs themselves offer funny 
perspectives on food, the kicker 
is really their accompanying 
videos, some of which have 
been ingrained in pop culture 
to the same extent as their base 
material. Part of the hilarity of 
food is its visual effect, and Al 

knows this better than anybody.
Although it would probably 
be considered insensitive today, 
Weird Al’s song “Fat,” a parody 
of Michael Jackson’s pivotal 
single “Bad,” is probably the hit 
that most people would know 
him for. Much of the tune’s 
success is due to its music 
video, a vision of Al’s ballooned 
body flying through the subway 
tunnels in a comedic version of 
the original Jackson video. The 
musician sings, “When I go to 
get my shoes shined / I gotta 
take their word / Because I’m 
fat, I’m fat, sham on,” in the 
same style as the iconic MJ, 
with a comedic twist that plays 
and contrasts with the canon 
to create a lasting hit. If you 
ignore the obvious fatphobic 
issues with the song, you can 
see Weird Al’s originality and 
interesting relationship with 
food shine through. Though 
there are some songs, like “Fat,” 
that may not have aged well as 
society has changed, they are 
still an example of how food 
and eating have always been 
undeniably funny, no matter 
who is listening.
This attention to detail and 
creative take on food parody 
is even more apparent in songs 
like “Eat It,” another Jackson 
parody of “Beat It,” “Addicted 
to Spuds” (“Addicted to Love,” 
Robert Palmer), “I Love Rocky 
Road” (“I Love Rock and Roll,” 
Joan Jett), “Spam” (“Stand,” 
R.E.M.) and even more. Lyrics 
include: “Spam in the back of 
my car (ham and pork) / Spam 
any place that you are (ham and 
pork) / The tab is there to open 
the can (spam any place that 
you are),” “Just eat it, eat it / 
Get yourself an egg and beat it,” 
“ I love rocky road / So won’t 
you go and buy half a gallon, 
baby / I love rocky road / So 
have another triple scoop with 
me.” With lines like these, any 
audience would know exactly 
what Al is talking about from 
the first word. Not only is his 
writing 
refreshingly 
simple, 
but it also plays on a childlike 
curiosity and interest in food 
that hides inside all of us. Weird 
Al knows the value of silliness, 
and is a clear supporter of 
playing with your food, no 
matter what your mother may 
have said.

STYLE NOTEBOOK

Kerrytown the vegan hotspot, 
with The Lunch Room, Detroit 
Filling Station, People’s Food 
Co-op and many others scattered 
across the neighborhood. The 
Ann Arbor restaurant scene 
puts any myth that the vegan 
diet is unappetizing or boring to 
shame. 

The Lunch Room:
The Lunch Room will always 
be Ann Arbor’s vegan gem. 
From seitan-made hot dogs (2 
for $10) to vegan pad thai ($12), 
The Lunch Room demonstrates 
vegan culinary creativity at its 
finest. They also serve a spread 
of vegan desserts, like ice cream 
sandwiches ($6) made with 
coconut milk and your choice 
of cookie outsides (ginger and 
fudge being my top choices). Not 
to mention The Lunch Room’s 
charmingly snug location nestled 
in the middle of the Kerrytown 
Market two streets away from 
the notorious Ann Arbor raised 
sandwich 
stop, 
Zingerman’s 
Delicatessen. Walking into The 
Lunch Room, you’ll be greeted 
by string lights, cobblestone 
pavement and kombucha. Vegan 
paradise awaits you.

Detroit Filling Station:
Head 
up 
another 
classic 
Kerrytown cobblestone road, 
past the Kerrytown Farmers 
Market and you can find the 
Detroit Filling Station, situated 
on the corner of Detroit Street 
and Catherine Street. For Sunday 
brunch, check out the Greek 
scramble ($13) bursting with 
tofu-based scrambled “eggs,” 
bell peppers, Yukon potatoes 
and herbed aioli toast, vegan 
pancakes ($3-$12) and almost 

any other breakfast item you 
crave. I really give kudos to the 
Detroit Filling station for nailing 
a solid vegan breakfast, the 
hardest vegan meal to master, as 
nearly all traditional breakfast 
plates center on animal sourced 

ingredients. Plan a visit on a 
Wednesday night for live jazz 
music or Thursday night for live 
bluegrass.

Fred’s:
Walking into Fred’s, you’ll 
find yourself in a bright space 
lined with quirky wall art and 
wooden furniture displays that 
must have come straight from 
a ‘Boho-mod’ Pinterest board. 
Freds’s menu thrives on clean 
eats that you will crave for 
days after. They serve unusual 

but inventive açai bowls, like 
the Mermaid Bowl ($10) with 
pineapple, coconut milk, blue 
algae and a medley of other 
superfood toppings, plus a line 
of freshly made smoothies each 
costing around $7-$8. And, as 
always, this vegan spot has a 
filling avocado toast ($7.50) 
served on sourdough bread, 
because healthy fats and carbs 
are a must.

Argus Farm Stop:
I only discovered Argus Farm 
Stop this year, but now you can 
catch me there almost every 
morning 
drinking 
a 
golden 
turmeric latte with almond 
milk ($3.25) alongside a vegan 
energy bite ($3) from Juicy 
Kitchen. Two of these farm-
centric locations have found 
homes across campus, one on 
Packard St. and the other on 
Liberty Street. Part cafe and 
part market, the Argus Farm 
Stop offers an array of artisanal 
products to purchase and taste, 
all of which are sourced from 
local farms around Michigan. 
They have lentil stews, baked 
goods from Juicy Kitchen and 
Tasty Bakery and crackly fresh 
bread provided daily. Argus 
is 
a 
low-profit 
organization 
with a mission to support local 
food 
systems. 
According 
to 
informational plaques displayed 
around Argus, “our country has 
lost 93% of its farms growing 
food since 1950.” While not 
all products here are vegan 
friendly, 
purchasing 
locally 
sourced 
food 
products 
are 
ultimately more economically 
and environmentally sustainable 
than most other commercial 
options.

MUSIC VIDEO : ‘THANK U, NEXT’

Ariana Grande’s “thank u, 
next” is a sensation of such 
magnitude that it’s easy to 
feel like Ariana has always 
been this cultural behemoth. 
Yet “thank u, next” is 
Ariana’s first Billboard 
number one hit. It’s easily 
her best performing single. 
What puts this song and its 
music video apart is Grande’s 
masterful execution and 
understanding of the social 
media hype machine. Both 
the single and music video 
have managed to drum 
intense fervor through 
references to pop culture 
without seeming insincere.
In the video, Ariana 
recreates iconic scenes 
from “Mean Girls,” “Bring 
It On,” “13 Going on 30” 
and “Legally Blonde.” She’s 
the centerpiece of these 
recreations, but fills in the 
spaces with so many cultural 
fixtures that it’s hard to keep 
your eye on just her. The 
opening scene, taking place 
in the halls of Upper Darby 
High School, features several 

students voicing their 
intense obsession with the 
pop star, who is playing the 
role of Regina George. One of 
those students just happens 
to be Troye Sivan.
In a later scene, Kris 
Jenner fills in as Ariana’s 

irresponsible mother, 
videotaping the “Plastics” at 
their Christmas show. She 
holds the camera out and 
gleefully yells “Thank you, 
next, bitch!”
Moments like these 
are where Ariana and 
her team show their total 
understanding of how 
culture works today. 
The movie was released 
three years before Kim 
Karadashian’s sex tape, yet 
eerily predicted the rise of a 

“Plastics”-like clique in the 
form of the Kardashians. 
By conflating Kris Jenner 
to shameless stage-mother 
Mrs. George, Ariana and 
her team essentially skewer 
our culture, in which people 
we love to hate become 
paramount. Using Kris as 
her fill-in is a genius move of 
reference, where the source 
becomes the material.
That sort of self-
awareness makes this 
video perfectly 2018. It’s a 
visual representation of the 
constantly referential world 
of Twitter, where everything 
is simultaneously about 
something else and yourself, 
like when we post photos 
of reality TV stars like Kris 
Jenner saying incredibly 
heinous things with the 
caption: “Me.”
In the “thank u, next” 
video, Ariana literally 
becomes pop culture, and 
pop culture becomes her.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK


I don’t have many talents. 
I was never the star of the 
spring musical, I never scored 
the winning goal. What I have 
done is bake — a lot. Baking 
has inserted itself into every 
holiday, every major celebration 
in my life. Friend accepted to 
college? Bake a cookie cake for 
them. Got a cool internship? 
Cupcakes! Looking for a way to 
procrastinate on a Wednesday 
night? I’ve got a muffin recipe 
for you. Every part of baking 
is personal, therapeutic and 
painstakingly 
meaningful. 
It gives you the opportunity 
to take a group of tasteless 
ingredients 
and 
assemble 
something extraordinary.
For me, the month of Dec. 
building up to Christmas has 
always meant a lot of things, 
but one of them stands out 
above the rest: baking. While 
other 
children 
associate 
Christmastime with the first 
snowfall or a desperate hunt 
to uncover their presents, I 
was happiest peeking into the 
oven, dipping my finger into 
unwatched batter and being 
the first taste tester of the 
ungodly mass of cookies my 
mother cranks out every year. 
I’d like to think of myself as a 
mature adult, one who doesn’t 
fall for the childish whim of an 
over-advertised holiday. Yet as 
soon as I catch the first whiff 
of my mother’s dangerously 
delicious 
chocolate-dipped 
butter cookies as their presence 
envelops my house, I can’t help 
but become possessed once 
more with that pesky holiday 
spirit.
And so I give you this recipe 
— 
this 
melt-in-your-mouth, 
sacred recipe — in hope that you 
will stop lamenting over the 
allegedly evil personification 
of capitalism and organized 
religion that is Christmas. 
When I make it myself, I lay 
out each step as if I am a Food 
Network star instead of a 
19-year-old girl making cookies 
alone. Each ingredient is a 
story, each step an assurance, 
all coming together to craft one 
damn good cookie. To quote the 
great modern philosopher Sara 
Bareilles, “You wanna know 
what’s inside? Simple question, 
so then what’s the answer? My 
whole life is in here, in this 
kitchen baking. What a mess 
I’m making.”

1 cup butter, softened

If you can give a cookie a 
heritage, butter cookies like 

these are technically Italian, 
but that doesn’t stop my Polish 
side from perfecting them each 
year. I’d like to think baking 
them is an attempt by my Polish 
family to take advantage of 
holiday cheer and reach across 
the aisle to the other half of my 
family, the one that came from 
Italy. Or maybe they’re just 
easy to make. My grandmother 

and mother always fight about 
who used the recipe first. I 
don’t care. I’ll never tell whose 
are better.

½ cup confectioner’s sugar

My 18th birthday was a 
snow day. Instead of enduring 
the ego-boosting delight of 
everyone in the hall wishing 
me a “happy birthday,” I sat 
alone in my room starting and 
restarting books that stood 
piled on my nightstand. I made 
my first mug brownie that day, 
and I’ve made hundreds since.

1 teaspoon vanilla

Who isn’t obsessed with the 
scent of vanilla? To this day 
I inhale the aroma with the 
enthusiasm of a juul addict. 

Spoiler: It doesn’t taste nearly 
as good as it smells.

2 cups all-purpose flour

My first attempt at baking 
came at the hands of a corrupt 
Easy-Bake Oven. It was not even 
my own, because as a young 
tomboy I couldn’t imagine 
anything worse than spending 
my afternoons partaking in 
pink frilly activities meant to 
confine women to the domestic 
sphere before they even hit 
puberty. I tried to make a mini 
bundt cake and burnt my hand, 
cementing 
my 
hatred 
and 
resentment of Hasbro and its 
patriarchal propaganda.

1 cup semisweet chocolate 
chips

As I normally write for the 
TV section of The Daily, many 
of my friends think that I am an 
expert on all things television, 
popular and unpopular. I nod, 
agree and ignore the fact the 
only show I’ve watched for 
the past month is “The Great 
British Baking Show.”

1 tablespoon butter

Do you ever wonder why the 
world still gives Paula Deen a 
platform?

Holiday sprinkles

Christmas was the last day 
I saw my grandfather before 
he died years ago. We snuck 
too many cookies behind our 
family’s back. He helped me 
perfect the art of dunking a 
holiday cookie into a bath of 
hot cocoa, letting the red and 
green colors run together like 
a river. Last year when I was 
baking Christmas cookies, a 
cardinal perched outside the 
window.

In a bowl, cream butter and 
sugar.
Add vanilla; mix well.
Gradually add flour; mix well. 
cover and chill for 1 hour.
Shape 
tablespoonfuls 
of 
dough into 2-1/2-in. x 1/2-
in. sticks. Place 2 in. apart 
on ungreased baking sheets. 
Flatten about three-fourths of 
each stick lengthwise with a 
fork.
Bake at 350° until set, 14-16 
minutes. Cool on baking sheets.
Melt chocolate chips and 
shortening until smooth; dip the 
round end of each cookie.
Add holiday sprinkles. Place 
on waxed paper until firm.

And above all, enjoy.

Thursday, December 6, 2018 — 5B

I’ve been holding onto some 
bitterness for a while. Almost 
a year, actually, ever since I 
finished the second season 
of “The Great British Baking 
Show” last February. I don’t 
remember how I came across 
the show initially. It popped up 
on my Netflix queue sometime 
last winter and something in 
the back of my brain told me 
“Yes, Natalie, give this a shot.” 
I’d never even been that into 

food television before, unless 
you count my parents and me 
watching “Chuck’s Day Off” 
on the Cooking Channel or the 
occasional Martha Stewart. 
Food Network, despite The 
Daily’s 
previous 
show 
of 
support for their work, just 
never did it for me.
So you can imagine my 
surprise when I became deeply 
enthralled in the universe 
of “The Great British Baking 
Show.” Because it is, I believe, 
its own universe, with the 
green fields of Welford Park 
and the names of its judges 
— 
Mary 
Berry 
and 
Paul 
Hollywood — existing outside 
the 
constraints 
of 
space 
and time. The entire show’s 
premise 
isn’t 
immediately 
made clear, either. All I could 
glean as I jumped straight 
into the second season is that 
it is set around a bunch of 
U.K. residents gathering in 
a tent to bake, be judged and 
be eliminated by Mary and 
Paul. A year out and I’m still 
not completely sure what the 
star baker stands to win at the 
end of the show, other than 
briefly becoming a household 
name and maybe publishing a 
cookbook or two. But somehow 
none of this is ultimately 
necessary to buy into the 
show’s intrigue, which I did 

without question.
Season two of “The Great 
British Baking Show” became 
a mode of comfort and escape 
for me. I would watch as these 
charming, over-eager British 
men and women of all ages 
would 
either 
persevere 
or 
crumble in their attempts to 
make pastries, cakes, bread 
and biscuits that would meet 
the high standards of Mary 
and Paul. Each episode is 
structured the same: There’s 

a Signature Challenge, which 
allows each baker to present 
a version of that week’s baked 
good they’ve made before; the 
Technical Challenge, where 
the 
bakers 
must 
perfectly 
execute a recipe presented by 
Mary or Paul and which leaves 
out important details such 
as cooking time to see if the 
baker can still pull it off; and 
the Showstopper Challenge, 
where bakers present their 
own interpretation of a classic 
baked good. And in each 
episode, drama would unfold 
when in the final seconds 

of a challenge a finishing 
decoration fell askew or a 

biscuit crumpled upon coming 
out of its tin, laying wreckage 
to an otherwise quality bake.

I bought into all of it — the 
adorable optimism of bakers 
like Glenn and Howard and 
Christine, who were only there 
to make their families proud, 
and the overzealous hosts Mel 
and Sue who moved the show 
along with their bad puns. I 
bought into all of it and, in the 
end, “The Great British Baking 
Show” betrayed my trust.
It isn’t that I’ve never seen a 
competition show before. I’ve 
watched my fair share of “The 

Bachelor” and old re-runs of 
“Iron Chef” glimmer through 
my childhood memory. But in 
accepting “The Great British 
Baking Show” for what it’s 
worth — its innocence, its 
purity, its all together feel-
good nature that felt like, even 
when someone was sent home, 
it wasn’t truly the end for them 
— I didn’t realize that you can’t 
expect to predict the ending 
of a show whose premise 
you don’t understand. I’m a 
firm believer, after devoting 
my unreserved attention to 
every detail of this 10 episode 

season, that Kimberley should 
have been 2013’s winner. Even 
Ruby, 
the 
college 
student 
who I didn’t particularly like 
for most of the season, had 
performed better for most 
of the season than Frances, 
who ultimately took home the 
title of Star Baker. I was quite 
honestly shocked that Frances 
even made it to the final 
episode of the series. While 
her bakes often qualified for 
number one or two spots in the 
Showstopper challenges, her 
technical bakes repeatedly fell 
flat, including her adaptation 
of pretzels in the final episode. 
Kimberley, on the other hand, 
showed intuition in the craft 
and 
demonstrated 
growth, 
performing 
better 
as 
each 
week passed.
In retrospect, I should have 
expected things would not go 
the way I wanted them to for 
Kimberley. My concern began 
around episode six, the sweet 
dough week, when Howard 
was sent home instead of 
Glenn. Despite his inability 
to master the technical bakes, 
Howard’s 
signature 
and 
showstopper bakes had so 
much more assurity, and he 
always executed them with 
confidence 
(we 
all 
recall 
his Picasso Sun Bread from 
episode two). Not only that, 

but he was consistently a 
favorite of Paul and Mary’s, 
with Glenn acting as a more 
alienating 
figure 
with 
his 
frequently panicked execution 
when faced with emergencies 
under the tent.
I feared early on in the 
season that Paul’s evident bias 
in favor of Ruby would be the 
only factor pushing her to the 
finals. But as the episodes 
passed, she began proving 
herself with baked goods like a

While other 
children associate 
Christmas time 
with the first 
snowfall or a 
desperate hunt 
to uncover their 
presents, I was 
happiest peeking 
into the oven, 
dipping my finger 
into unwatched 
batter and being 
the first taste 
tester.

Citrus Tea Loaf and interesting 
twists on classic goods that 
incorporated 
ingredients 
like 
saffron, 
proving 
Paul 
and 
Mary’s 
suspicion 
of 
such 
ingredients 
wrong. 
Ruby, however, never had a 
believable shot at winning 
the show. Framed as a judge 
favorite from the beginning, 
Ruby’s win would have been 
too expected and would have 
glaringly juxtaposed with her 
constant anxiety under the 
baking tent and vocalized self-
doubt.
The shock over Frances’s 
win truly stems from the 

fact 
that 
she 
was 
never 
extraordinary enough to stand 
out among the other two. She 
was the one among these three 
women with the fewest Star 
Baker wins, and never baked 
anything that stuck in my mind 
as an impressive feat. Even 
on her bad weeks, Kimberley 
still produced at least one that 
stunned (like her vegetable 
cake from week eight, which 
somehow lost to Ruby). Yet 
somehow 
Paul 
and 
Mary 
overlooked this, and I blame 
mostly Paul and his goatee for 
this tragedy, because Mary 
Berry can do no wrong.

Since 
my 
heartbreak, 
I 
haven’t been able to return 
to “The Great British Baking 
Show.” 
I 
don’t 
see 
it 
as 
worthwhile 
to 
once 
again 
become attached to characters 
only to see them ultimately 
deprived of their due fortune. 
I briefly tried again over the 
summer, jumping into season 
five only to find out Mary 
Berry had departed the show. 
This was the final betrayal. 
“The Great British Baking 
Show,” while serving as a brief 
respite from the gaudy reality 
TV saturating our lives, could 
do no more for me.

Because it is, I 
believe, its own 
universe, with 
the green fields 
of Welford Park 
and the names of 
its judges — Mary 
Berry and Paul 
Hollywood — 
existing outside 
the constraints of 
space and time.

I write this having just 
signed my lease for the next 
school year, petrified at the 
prospect of having to cook for 
myself EVERY DAY. Call it 
lazy, characteristic of the weird 
millennial-Gen Z hybrid I am 
— I don’t care, I am the leftover 
queen! 
When 
you’re 
raised 
by someone with a knack for 
cooking sans the recipes, you 
can’t help but feel like a fool 
every time you enter the kitchen 
(thanks Mom!). It’s more funny 
than it is tragic — from making 
playlists to slicing onions with 
goggles on, I don’t think any 
other activity better draws out 
my creativity. However, I will 
say that goggle situation was a 
one-time thing. The true dream 
team is the union between my 
cooking and music.
Music is the key spice to all of 
my recipes. I’m not particularly 
adroit nor attentive in the 
kitchen, so I’m certain my music 
has 
saved 
countless 
baked 
goods. That being said, my 
music taste for the moment can 
get contextual. If I’m cooking 
at my parents’ home over the 
holidays, I’m inclined to listen 
to Arabic music. It transports 
me back to a Ramadan, my mom 
pulling rotisserie chicken out of 
the oven with the cold wafting 
in from outside the way it did 
10 years ago. Arabic music also 
has a distinct character and 
range to it, the energies shifting 
from your characteristic love 
song to unadulterated, unironic 
patriotism. There was also a 
point in the mid to late ’00s 
where every Lebanese song 
sounded like it came out of a 

tropey spy movie — this is 
my most ideal taste. It almost 
elevates the task of rolling grape 
leaves when Fares Karam is 
blaring in the background over 
a goblet drum.
More often, I have taken to 
baking with my friend in her 
apartment on Fridays. I consider 
myself more of spoon licker in 
these situations, occasionally 
cracking the eggs or adding 
a dash of cinnamon. But I 
promise this bond is symbiotic. 
These moments are when I feel 
most like a DJ, cranking out my 
very niche taste in rap music as 
Makenzie works her magic with 
the oven — we are now both 
very enamored with Noname’s 
Room25 
and 
snickerdoodles. 
Numerous 
Kendrick 
Lamar 
appearances also make their 
way into this jam session as well 
— I aggressively advocate for his 
G.O.A.T status. The idea behind 
this is for Makenzie to teach me 
to bake as we exchange music 
tastes, but it usually ends with 
us lip syncing to 3OH!3’s “Don’t 
Trust Me” and realizing what’s 
in the oven.
I flounder in the summer 
when it is necessary that I cook 
on a daily basis. I have my fair 
share of microwave magic, but 
I’ll also occasionally turn to 
sandwiches when I’m feeling 
particularly 
innovative. 
The 
sweet spot is breakfast foods — 
it can’t get worse than a burnt 
first pancake. This is where my 
cooking music takes a turn for 
the mundane and unexpected. 
I’ll 
find 
myself 
restrained 
enough to listen to full length 
albums or explore new artists 
I 
otherwise 
wouldn’t 
feel 
inclined to. It makes for some 
uncanny associations I can 
never seem to rip apart. I refuse 
to separate the scent of burnt 
pizza with Tyler the Creator’s 

Flower Boy.
I wouldn’t say I have any 
interest in or hopes of becoming 
a master cook, though I don’t 
believe that has diminished 
from 
my 
experiences 
with 
cooking. Beyond the hilarity 
I attribute to my innumerable 
defeats in the kitchen, some of 
my best ideas for playlists and 
opportunities to share music 
root themselves here.

I used to hate cooking, which, 
in my Persian family where 
the menu for dinner parties 
was planned weeks in advance 
and execution was an all-day 
affair, was near blasphemy. But 
I couldn’t deny it — I grew up 
watching my various aunts, older 
cousins and two grandmothers 
bustle around different kitchen 
backdrops cooking everything 
from Zereshkt Polo (barberry 
rice) to Bademjan (eggplant 
and tomato stew) yet I could 
never bring myself to recreate 
these recipes back home. Part 
of it was intimidation — Iranian 
dishes are notoriously difficult 
to make, and, since most recipes 
are passed down between family 
members, it’s hard to find the 
best agreed upon recipe online. 
Diving into a recipe that calls 
for an array of herbs, different 
types of beans and lamb without 
really understanding how to 
best cook the beans, sauté the 
herbs and prepare the lamb is 
a hassle at best and terrifying 
at worst. However, most of 
my 
hesitation 
came 
from 
the knowledge that I would 
never be able to recreate the 
atmosphere I saw surrounding 
cooking in Iran. There, the 
kitchen would be packed with 
different 
family 
members, 
each preparing or helping to

B-SIDE SECONDARY

‘Julie and Julia’ and the long legacy of food movies

After every movie, without 
fail, I will watch the credits. 
This originally started because 
I 
was 
waiting 
for 
those 
surprise Marvel endings, but 
now it’s more about looking 
for random people in the cast 
like the interns and the other 
background people who helped 
bring the movie to life. Looking 
back, though, one key cast 
member is always missing: the 
food. Maybe this is because 
food isn’t a person or, more 
likely, it’s because the movie 
credits the prop or set designer 
under which the responsibility 
of food falls. The thing is, 
food is always in movies and 
always makes an appearance. 
It’s an A-list star that gets 
less attention than the intern 
making coffee runs
“Julie 
and 
Julia” 
is 
a 
movie that emphasizes the 
role of food in our lives in 
an extreme way, yet never 
actually 
acknowledges 
its 
part in building the movie. It 
starts with Julie Powell (Amy 
Adams, “Enchanted”) deciding 
to cook all 542 recipes in Julia 
Child’s (Meryl Streep, “The 
Post”) “Mastering the Art of 
French Cooking.” Not only 
does the food serve as a catalyst 

in Julie’s life, but it’s also the 
thread that holds the whole 
film together. Without it, there 
is 
no 
connection 
between 
Julie and Julia, and there is 
no movie. “Julie and Julia” 
also carries the distinct air of 
a romantic comedy, but both 
characters have already found 
their “one.” So what gives? It 
could be the fact that “Julie and 
Julia” is a Nora Ephron movie, 
but I think it’s because we are 
still watching two characters 
fall in love — just with food 
instead of a person.
Another part of food that 
“Julie 
and 
Julia” 
captures 
beautifully 
is 
its 
dynamic 
relationship 
with 
someone. 
Turning something as simple 
as a piece of beef into beef 
bourguignon or killing a live 
lobster is an intimate process 
that brings Julie closer to food 
and, subsequently, the audience. 
Together, we go through the 
same emotional turmoil when 
the stew is ruined, or a freshly 
murdered lobster is slathered 
in butter for our enjoyment. 
Not only that, but food is also 
used as a tool of empowerment 
for Julia. As a woman in 1950s 
Paris trying to break into the 
cooking world, a mostly male-
dominated profession, she has 
her work ahead of her, but food 
doesn’t 
discriminate. 
Food, 

instead, is Julia’s key to a life 
that is more than just being a 
diplomat’s housewife. 
Julia Child and food also 
have a unique relationship: 
Before 
her, 
food 
wasn’t 
recognized as widely in the 
media as it is today. There were 
no “cooking shows” or Food 
Network. So, while we may owe 
our enjoyment of media to food, 
food owes its own media legacy 
to Julia Child.
It could be argued that the 
way food gets used is up to the 
directors and producers, but 
that is true for all actors. In the 
same way that an actor’s talent 
can get lost in a director’s 
vision, so too can the essence 
of food. We can see in reality 
television 
shows 
like 
“The 
Kardashians” that food isn’t so 
much of an art as it is a spark for 
drama. Heated arguments are 
made over Waldorf salads while 
family announcements occur at 
a backyard dinner. One of the 
more iconic dramatizations of 
food is a drink thrown in anger, 
frustration or even just plain 
fun.
Other 
times, 
food’s 
role 
as 
a 
character 
(like 
in 
“Julie and Julia”) isn’t as 
important as its place in a 
character’s personality. Take 
“Gilmore Girls,” for instance.

FILM NOTEBOOK

prepare a dish. Cooking was 
an 
extravagant 
affair, 
the 
clamour of different voices 
climbing over each other and 
multiple appliances clanking 
against pots and pans serving 
as a constant soundtrack to the 
whole endeavor. There was no 
appeal in coming back to my 
silent kitchen and attempting 
to make these meals if I knew 
the most important part of the 
meal — the company — would be 
missing.
I 
cannot 
tell 
you 
what 
changed this past summer, 
what shift in mindset caused 
me to wholeheartedly start to 
love cooking. Perhaps it was my 
resolve to leave Persian recipes 
behind for the time being and 
turn to more friendly dishes. 
Perhaps it was my discovery 
that music could just as easily 
replace the chatter and the 
clamour I had grown up with. 
Or perhaps it was a little bit 
of both that caused me to 
dedicate the empty stretches of 
late afternoon that oftentimes 
come during summer months 
to 
learning 
and 
mastering 
recipes I stumbled upon online. 
Most importantly, the songs 
that accompanied my cooking 
helped make the food more 
intimately mine, tumbling out 
of my speakers and providing 
me the company I needed to 
enjoy my time alone in the 
kitchen.
The 
first 
recipe 
I 
truly 
mastered, the one that was most 
integral in changing how I felt 
about cooking, was the French 
dish ratatouille. When I first 
started learning, it was deep in 
the middle of this past summer, 
and both Playboi Carti’s Die 
Lit and Parquet Courts’s Wide 
Awake 
had 
just 
dropped. 
Ratatouille 
is 
essentially 
a 
summer vegetable medley — 

a mix of eggplant, zucchini, 
tomato 
and 
onion. 
I 
have 
memories of walking down to 
Lucky’s Market to gather the 
vegetables 
with 
songs 
like 
“Shoota” or “Mardi Gras Beads” 
blaring out of my headphones. 
Unlike most French cooking, 
ratatouille does not have a 
set recipe; rather, it differs 
depending on the cook. The 
only aspect of ratatouille that 
is definitive is the detail that 
makes its flavor so distinctive 
(and worth the long cooking 
time): all the vegetables are 
oven roasted separately, well-
bathed in olive oil and then 
roasted together again in order 
to revive the flavors. It is a dish 
that is simultaneously very easy 
— it’s only roasted vegetables, 
after all — and very difficult: 
These 
roasted 
vegetables 
have to be prepared, chopped 
and seasoned with care in 
order for the best flavors to 
come out. I found that playing 
slower songs — “Nakamarra” 
by Hiatus Kaiyote and “The 
Bird” by Anderson .Paak come 
to mind — when prepping 
the 
ingredients 
helped 
me 
achieve the best results. “A 
bird with a word came to me / 
The sweetness of a honeycomb 
tree,” .Paak croons, and it was 
near impossible to not pause 
whatever I was cutting at the 
moment and take a step back, 
knife held aloft, and assess the 
scene around me in relation to 
the smooth groove of the song. 
Everything was harmonious: 
The underlying bright jazz 
instrumental matched the hue 
of the vegetables spread across 
the cutting board, the late 
afternoon breeze entering my 
sun-drenched apartment was 
as light as .Paak’s voice. It felt 
good to be cooking this dish in 
this moment. It felt right.

The total time to make 
ratatouille 
hovers 
around 
three 
to 
four 
hours. 
The 
majority of this comes from 
the extensive period you have 
to let the vegetables bake in 
the oven. Therefore, for all 
the time you spend actually 
cooking ratatouille, you spend 
even longer waiting for it to be 
done. To distract myself from 
opening the oven every five 
seconds, I usually soundtracked 
this period with songs that 
announced 
themselves 
with 
intensity. 
Vegetables 
stewed 
under sprigs of rosemary and 
thyme. I let Princess Nokia’s “I 
don’t give a fuck” attitude in 
“Flava” rattle the walls of my 
studio. I tried to teach myself 
to dance to The Pharcyde 
“Soul Flower” remix (failing 
miserably). I watched as Young 
Thug’s “Memo” serenaded the 
sunset. And finally it was time 
to eat what I had made.
Kendrick 
Lamar 
and 
De 
La Soul, Frank Ocean and 
Toro Y Moi, Mos Def and 
KAYTRANADA 
... 
most 
of 
the music I usually like to 
listen to in the summer has 
now inexplicably been tied 
to cooking ratatouille in my 
cramped kitchen, excited for 
whatever the rest of the night 
had in store for me with warm 
weather still feeling like it 
would last forever. I still very 
much enjoy cooking now. The 
months have turned icy, but 
ratatouille, 
and 
the 
music 
that for a short period of time 
turned empty space into one 
filled with life and sound, will 
always remind me of why I fell 
in love with the art of cuisine 
in the first place — music and 
food blending together to create 
flavors I never knew existed.
