'U' served as one of
100 testing grounds
for direct student
lending program
By BETHANY BIRON
DailyStaffReporter
President Barack Obama
recently signed a bill into law
that aims to overhaul student
aid by implementing direct stu-

dent lending at colleges across
the nation.
But this won't mean much of a
change for the University where
direct student lending has been
in place for years. In fact, cur-
rent and former University
officials were involved in' the
development of the concept of
direct student lending, and the
University served as a testing
ground for the program.
Thomas Butts was the direc-
tor of the University's Student
Financial Aid office from 1971

to 1977, and later, the deputy
assistant secretary for Stu-
dent Financial Assistance for
the federal government dur-
ing President Jimmy Carter's
administration from 1977 to
1981. Butts then worked in the
University's Office of Govern-
ment Relations in Washington
D.C. in the early 1990s, during
which time he collaborated with
former State Rep. William Ford
(D-Mich.) to develop a direct
student lending pilot program
for select schools across the

nation.
In 1994, the University
became one of 100 schools to
take part in the direct student
loan initiative. According to
Butts, the decision to take part
in the program was largely due
to the desire of former Univer-
sity President James Duderstadt
to change financial aid pro-
grams at the University and his
asking Butts for help in getting
that accomplished.

About 100 students gathered

responsibility.
Shannon Schuyler, managing
director of corporate responsibil-

at the event about the importance
of corporate responsibility to
both consumers and prospective

"The topic of corporate respon-

Schuyler said during her presenta-

Schuyler focused on raising
awareness of the ethical respon-
sibilities that corporations may
shoulder and tried to create a

Donating Dining Dollars

The word manah comes from
the Abrahamic tradition sod
refers to food that the Israelites
were ahie to pull from the sky
when they were hungry. But for
a new student group on campus,
the word is more than just ahbib-
lical reference.
Founded this semester
by LSA freshman Michelle
Rubinstein, Michigan 'Against
Neglecting Ann Arbor Hunger,
better known as MANAH, is a
student organization that works
to put students' unused Dining
Dollars to good use for the com-
munity.
"tt has that type of meaning
for people here who are hungry
and can just pull food from us
because we're able to help them
out with our leftover funds," she
said.
MANAH plans to pool
together leftover Dining Dollars

from students' meal plans at
the end of the semester and use
them to purchase food for local
food banks.
"I thought that since every-
one, or the great majority of
people who purchase the meal
plans have those extra dollars
left over at the end of the year,
that we can use them in a bet-
ter way so that we could pur-
chase packaged goods that food
shelters in the Ann Arbor area
need," Rubinstein said.
Dining Dollars are part of
University Housing's meal plan
options that can be used at con-
venience stores and cafes located
in residence halls like Victor's,
the Hideaway and Ciao Down
Pizzeria. The dollars expire at
the end of each academic year
and are non-refundable.
"Food pantries (can put them
to use) instead of (students) just

not spending them so that we
are helping people, especially
with the state of the economy,"
Rubinstein said.
In addition to providing those
in need with food, the club aims
to provide students with a way
to determine where their left-
over money is going, Rubinstein
said.
The tO-member organization
is currently in the process of
contacting local food shelters to
figure outchow the club can most
effectively serve their needs.
"We know that Michigan has
been hit the hardest and there's
so many people struggling just
to get food on the table for their
families," she said. "So if we have
these leftover resources, why not
reinvest them in the community
that we live in to better help the
people that are struggling?"

weapons ban
Gun rights advocates are pro-

dent weapons ban by wearing
empty holsters on the suburban
Detroit campus.
Police at the Rochester school
say they know of about five peo-
ple who have participated in this
week's protest.
University President Gary
Russi says the student code of con-
duct prevents students from car-
rying weapons, while the school
"regrettably" recognizes the legal
. right of others to carry weapons
on campus.
Group member Brett Mctsaac
of Rochester says people should
be able to defend themselves if
they have the legal right to carry
a weapon.

Lucido tells The Oakland Press
of Pontiac the group Students for

BANGKOK
Thai P.M. declares
state of emergency
Thailand's beleaguered prime
minister declared a state of emer-
gency to quell weeks of paralyz-
ing protests costing businesses
tens of millions of dollars. But the
demonstrators championing the
rights of the rural poor remained
uncowed, and whether the show-
down can end without violence is
unknown.
Prime Minister Abhisit Vej-
jajiva acted after mostly peaceful
protests escalated yesterday when
demonstrators burst into parlia-
ment and forced lawmakers to flee
on ladders over a back wall, with
senior officials hastily evacuated
by helicopter.
Yesterday's chaos was a contin-
uation of the long-running battle

between partisans of the coun-
try's former leader - Thaksin
Shinawatra, who was ousted by a
2006 military coup - and those
who oppose him. Thaksin was
accused of corruption and show-
ing disrespect to the country's
0 revered monarch.
The demonstrators, called the
Red Shirts for their attire, bene-
fited from Thaksin's populist poli-
cies such as cheap health care and
village loans. They have demand-
ed that Abhisit dissolve parlia-
ment within 15 days and call new
elections, claiming he took office
illegitimately in December 2008
with the help of military pressure
on parliament.

U.S. Chief Justice John Rob-

es on laws, as Congress can when

Roberts spoke yesterday at the

in Indianapolis.
Roberts was asked about a
remark during his 2005 confir-
mation hearings in which he said
he wanted to build consensus on
the court. Roberts responded that
* justices differing in their inter-
pretations of law cannot act like
lawmakers and strike compromis-
es halfway.

West Virginia State Police officers direct traffic in front of an entrance to the Massey Energy Co.'s Upper Big Branch mine in
Montcoal, W.Va. after an explosion in the mine.
W~a.gov., measured in
discussing mine fallout

Manchin incorrectly
told families that all
workers had survived
Sago collapse in 2006
NAOMA, W.Va. (AP) - Gov. Joe
Manchin four years ago delivered
what seemed to be miraculous
news: a dozen miners had survived
an explosion at the Sago mine -
only to then have to tell devastated
families that all but one were dead.
Those who watched the tragedy
unfold on the national news were
dumbfounded: How could the gov-
ernor so carelessly lift spirits with-
out knowing for certain the miners'
fate?
As the worst U.S. mining disas-
ter in two decades unfolds this
week, Manchin has been a cau-
tious and calm presence, vowing
to communicate with families with
compassion and frequently even if
he doesn't have much new to tell

them. The explosion at the Upper
Big Branch mine killed 25 and four
others remain missing; rescuers
have been laboring for the pasttwo
days to try to reach tiem while also
battling poisonous gases that bottle
up underground.
The shadow of the 2006 Sago
mine disaster has hung over the
explosion at Upper Big Branch.
Manchin has kept a high profile,
delivering regular briefings to the
media, and updating families in
person every two hours.
He's been measured in tone and
in the news he delivers. The cau-
tiousness is a change from Sago, but
in some ways Manchin is playing
the same role: comforter-in-chief
to a state whose identity is so linked
with coal that a statue of a miner
graces the grounds of the Capitol.
At Sago, Manchin heard along
with relatives the wildfire rumor
that all but one of the 13 miners had
survived, and then joined in their
celebration and helped to relay the
bogus information that only made

the heartache worse when reality
set in.
"It was the euphoria of the
moment," Manchin recalled later.
"The (church) bells were going off,
everybody was hugging and kiss-
ing. We'd been together for two
days, and to get news like this..."
This time, miners' families have
been largely sequestered from the
media on the site, unlike at Sago,
where the two groups mingled.
Information comes from Manchin,
or from one of the officials by his
side, atfrequent briefings.
Manchin has also changed.
While people cling to the hope that
their loved ones are among the four
who haven't been found dead, the
governor serving his second term
has tempered that optimism with
frank talk about the enormity of
the blast.
"You're always hoping for that
miracle," he said, his voice trail-
ing off after adding, "but when you
have an explosion of this magni-
tude..."

Man angry about
health care bill,
results in angry
voice mails
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A
California man angry about health
care reform allegedly made threat-
ening and harassing phone calls
to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,
including at least one call in which
he got through and spoke to her
directly, law enforcement officials
said.
Gregory Lee Giusti, 48, was
arrested Wednesday at his San
Francisco home, said Joseph
Schadler, spokesman for the FBI's
San Francisco office. Schadler
would not disclose the charges
against Giusti, saying they were
under seal until his first appear-
ance before a federal magistrate,
scheduled for Thursday.
The arrest came a day after a
Washington state man was arrest-
ed for allegedly leaving threaten-
ing voicemails for U.S. Sen. Patty
Murray, and as other Democratic
lawmakers have faced vicious ver-
bal attacks over their support of
the historic health care overhaul.
Several federal officials said
Giusti made dozens of calls to
Pelosi's homes in California and
Washington, as well as to her hus-
band's business office. They said
he recited her home address and
said if she wanted to see it again,
she would not support the health
care overhaul bill that since has
been enacted.
One official said the man is
believed to have spoken directly
with Pelosi at least once.
The officials spoke on condition
of anonymity because they were
not authorized to discuss the case
publicly.
Giusti has been in trouble pre-
viously for making threats. In
2004, he pleaded no contest in

San Mateo County, just south of
San Francisco, to a felony charge
of making criminal threats and
was sentenced to a year in jail and
three years of supervised proba-
tion. Other details of that case
were not immediately available.
A statement from Pelosi's
spokesman Wednesday praised the
efforts of law enforcement and said
the House Speaker would have no
further comment "at this time."
On Tuesday, Pelosi told report-
ers in San Francisco that "people
have been active in expressing
their disagreement." Sometimes
those expressions have risen "to
the level of threats or violence,"
she said, explaining that she was
not allowed to comment on her
own situation.
Rose Riggs, a neighbor of Giusti
in a public housing complex in the
city's Tenderloin district, said she
saw two plainclothes and two uni-
formed officers take him away in
zip-tie cuffs. Riggs, 62, said Giusti
was known for engaging in heated
political debates with others in the
building.
"He was not one of my favor-
ite people. He had a real attitude
problem," she said.
Neighbor Greg Little, 53, said he
also saw officers take Giusti away.
"He was real quiet when they
took him out. He wasn't combat-
ive," Little said.
Sister Lorna Walsh, commu-
nity operations manager of the
Mercy Housing complex where
Giusti lives, said he had lived in
the subsidized housing for almost
10 years. She would not comment
further.
On Tuesday, federal authorities
in Washington state announced
charges against Charles Alan
Wilson, 63, for allegedly made
threatening calls to Murray. Offi-
cials said he left voicemails for the
senator, including ones in which
he's accused of saying "there's a
target on your back now" and "it
only takes one piece of lead."

Fundraiser must be
disclosed to state in
advance, Yee says
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)
- A California lawmaker said
yesterday that a state university
is breaking the law by failing to
disclose correspondence about an
upcoming fundraiser appearance
by Sarah Palin.
Sen. Leland Yee, D-San Fran-
cisco, filed a public records
request with California State
University, Stanislaus last week,
requesting any documents relat-
ed to the former Alaska gover-
nor's scheduled June 25 speech
to mark the school's 50th anni-
versary.
The university's compliance
officer, Gina Leguria, responded
to Yee on Tuesday, saying there
were no such documents.
Yee said he has evidence to the
contrary. Yesterday, he circulated
a March 29 e-mail sent from a top
university administrator to fac-

have been disclosed.
In the e-mail, Susana Gajic-
Bruyea, vice president for uni-
versity advancement, justifies
the choice of Palin, who com-
mands speaking fees as high as
$100,000.
Gajic-Bruyea said the high-
profile - and controversial
- public figure would attract
significant interest and boost

attendance at the black-tie gala,
whose tickets cost $500 each. She
stressed that private donations
would fund the event hosted by
the nonprofit CSU Stanislaus
Foundation.
"Not a cent of state funds will
be used for this event," she wrote.
Yee said Gajic-Bruyea's e-mail
is the sort of document that
should have been provided in
response to his public records
request. He has asked the state
attorney general to investigate
the matter.
"What other documents and
correspondence are they hid-
ing?" Yee said.
Evan Westrup, an attorney
general's office spokesman, said
the office had received Yee's
request and would review it.
University spokeswoman Eve
Hightower said that the fund-
raiser is a foundation event and
that all public records requests
are being referred to foundation
board president Matt Swanson.
She said the university did not
include Gajic-Bruyea's e-mail in
its response to Yee because the
e-mail had already been made
public when it first went out.
"It was circulated to staff,
faculty, student leadership, and
meant to be shared with anyone,"
Hightower said.
The Associated Press and other
organization have sought details
of the compensation package pro-
vided to Palin in exchange for her
appearance. The foundation has

T he University supposedly prides itself on encouraging
campus diversity, but its policy on housing doesn't seem
to support this claim. But that soon could change. A recent
survey of campus community members showed support for the
creation of a gender-neutral housing option. If implemented by
University Housing, students living in residence halls will have
the option to choose the gender of their roommate, a long-awaited
opportunity for many students, particularly those who identify
as transgendered. And students have shown that they favor the
option. To acknowledge the needs - and wants - of students, the
University should offer gender-neutral housing.

The proposal for gender-neutral housing,
introduced to the University in April 2009,
was designed to create a housing option tar-
geted at transgender students. Currently,
the option is only offered on an individual
need basis. After much debate, the Univer-
sity gave students an opportunity to voice
their opinions through a survey conduct-
ed by the Gender Neutral Housing Coali-
tion. According to an Apr. 2 Daily report,
19 percent of the 9,545 students surveyed
responded. 19 percent of respondents did
not support the option. But 67 percent of
those who responded said that gender-neu-
tral housing "would bea welcome option for
the University Housing community." And
38 percent of those responses claimed that
they would choose gender-neutral housing
if given the option.
Students should be given more housing
choices. As the policy stands now, hous-
ing doesn't provide an appealing option for
transgender students. And many students
who feel that living with a member of the
opposite sex may be a better situation for
them don't have that option. By not having
the opportunity to select a gender-neutral
rooming assignment, the University is
indirectly discriminating against these
students. If approved, this change would
create a greater sense of acceptance and
ensure that all students were comfortable
with their living situation.
Gender-neutral housing has already

been implemented and shown to work well
at several institutions of higher learning
across the country. According to a Sept. 30
Daily article about the proposal, 36 colleg-
es, including Harvard University and Stan-
ford University, have provided students
with a gender-neutral housing option. Uni-
versity Housing Spokesman Peter Logan
told the Daily in September that he has
been in contact with many of these schools
in exploration of the option, but campus
hasn't seen the results of these talks yet.
Since many other universities have seen
success, there's no reason the University
should be lagging behind.
The results of the recent survey show
that the majority of respondents support
the enactment of a gender-neutral option
in student residential housing. The posi-
tive response reveals that the desire for
its creation spans further than just those
students who would chose the option.
Students on campus have demonstrated
that they support a more inclusive hous-
ing option. The University should realize
the significance of this response and make
gender-neutral housing available.
The limits of current roommate gender
choice are unsatisfactory for students, and
the survey has proven that the campus
community supports a change. The Uni-
versity should respond appropriately and
in a timely manner to provide students
with the option of gender-neutral housing.

L iberals and conservatives
alike can agree that President
Barack Obama has a lot on his
plate. Though his
office is the plum
of politics, there's
no one alive who
envies his work-
load. An economic
crisis, two wars,
global warm-
ing, vast income
inequality, lag-
ging public educa- MATTHEW
tion, the continued
threat of terrorism GREEN
and countless other
concerns. It's got to
make Obama wonder at least once in a
while why he schlepped Michelle and
the girls to Washington to take this
seemingly impossible job.
But while Obama continues to focus
on the chasm between Wall Street and
Main Street, or between Israelis and
Palestinians, I hope he won't ignore
the restless tenor of cultural conten-
tion between everyday Americans
as well. He should take note of the
increasingly bitter divide between
his party and the GOP, fueled by even
more bitter cable news networks
on both sides of the debate. And on
another front, I hope Obama recog-
nizes that many Americans don't seem
to differentiate between the words
"terrorism" and "Islam."
Equally important, Obama must
address the Tea Party movement,
though not necessarily by adopting
any tenet of their antithetical, loosely
assembled platform. Rather, when
the historic health bill neared its pas-
sage last month, I hope the president's
ears perked up during meetings with
dithering Democrats to hear Tea Par-
tiers hurling epithets at black and gay
members of Congress.
Yet more important than just taking
note of these cultural realities, I hope

he'll say something in response.
I hope all of the above because I
know it's that famous Obama hope
- the one that Americans met dur-
ing a campaign about bringing people
together - that will once again (or per-
haps for the first time) unify the coun-
try. He conveyed that hope by reaching
out and inspiring Americans through
his oratory. And that's exactly what he
should do now. He ought to call a press
conference, look into the camera and
say somethinglike this:
"My fellow Americans, you've got to
listen up. Because I've been listening to
you, and I've heard a whole lot of crazy
talk. And more than crazy talk, I've
heard a lot of unproductive talk. For
starters, let's get it resolved once and
for all that'Socialism' is not the same as
'Fascism.' In fact, they're pretty differ-
ent from one another. Those who favor
universal health care are really not
'fascists,' people. And for that matter, if
some of you stopped using 'Socialism'
as a reactionary buzzword, and stud-
ied it in a philosophical context, you
may realize it raises some pretty good
points. Just somethingto think about.
"Andyouknow, Iwasthinkingabout
that whole conversation in 2008 about
whether ornotIwas a Muslim, and I've
been thinking that I took the wrong
approach. It's true that I'm a Christian.
Most definitely. But I should've asked:
what if I were a Muslim? I've got to tell
you, if it weren't for American Mus-
lims in our military, particularly those
who've served as Arabic translators,
our efforts in the Middle East wouldn't
be worth anything whatsoever. Count-
less Muslims now join the ranks of his-
tory's great American patriots.
"Which brings me to another point
- not only can non-Christians or non-
whites illustrate true 'patriotism,' but
non-heterosexuals, too, can exhibit the
true spirit of America. I'm not saying
you guys need to change your religious
views, but everyone's got to accept that

gay people are here to stay. Someone is
gay like someone is Asian or has green
eyes. They can allitry to hide it, but they
shouldn't have to in America. It's time
to treat the gay community with as
much respect as anyone else.
SObama needs to
put a stop to all of
the crazy talk.
"That respect is the bottom line,
people. It's what we're missing across
the board. Here in Washington, liber-
als and conservatives need to respect
each other since both, like gay people,
are here to stay. As the greatest coun-
try in the world, every nation ought
to respect us - but we can't expect
them to until we make ourselves
respectable. Think about it, people.
And God bless America."
Yeah, in a perfect world, it might go
somethinglike that.
It's appropriate for a president,
especially one formerly on the faculty
of an esteemed university, to take a
moment to teach the country some-
thing important.
Presidents, we are taught in gram-
mar school, must wear a number of
hats while they're in office. But they
must never forget that the United
States is a nation of hard hats in addi-
tion to top hats; one of yarmulkes
and hijabs and turbans, too. We wear
graduation caps and hairnets, sailor
caps and sombreros. And as Obama
puts on his hat as our head of state,
the ceremonial head of one indivisible
nation, it's his duty to remind us that
that's exactly what we are.

Promoting fire safety awareness

On Saturday, Apr. 3, four fires were reported off cam-
pus within a span of 12 hours. The first, reported early
Saturday morning at 909 Church Street, consisted of
three burning cars and damaged the adjacent Abbey
apartment complex but resulted in no injured or dis-
placed residents. The second, a trash can fire on White
Street, occurred within the next few hours. The third
fire was initially reported as a burning trash bag on the
porch of 928 State Street early Saturday morning. The
fire spread to a sofa on the porch and quickly engulfed the
house in flames. Of the seven people in the building, three
were taken to the hospital due to injuries sustained while
escaping the house. One of the hospitalized residents -
Renden LeMasters, a 22-year-old Eastern Michigan Uni-
versity student - sadly passed away later that day. The
last reported fire involved a burning newspaper under-
neath the window of a house on the 700 block of Church
Street and occurred early Saturday afternoon.
As the chair and vice chair of the Michigan Student
Assembly Campus Safety Commission, it is our role to pro-
vide the student body with safety information relating to
all areas of on-campus and off-campus life. Our thoughts
and condolences go out to the LeMasters family during
this difficult time and we hope that such a tragedy can be
avoided in the future.
Having spoken with a number of students regarding Sat-
urday's fires, it is evident that many are concerned and are
looking for ways to prevent similar incidents in their own
homes. After meeting with the Department of Public Safety,
we wish to share some safety procedures regarding fire pre-
vention and suggested protocol in the event of a fire. As the
cause of each of Saturday's fires still remain unknown, it is
important to consider a variety of fire safety precautions.
Here are some ideas:
Try not to light fires outdoors. In the last month, state
and local officials advised not to burn anything outside. Due
to the recent heat wave and dry air, vegetation and wooden
structures are more susceptible to catching fire.
Be careful when you grill. With the weather improving
and more students using outdoor grills, it is important that
hot coals and ashes are extinguished and discarded safely.

Dispose of cigarette butts properly. Verify that all ciga-
rette butts are completely put out before disposing of them.
Also avoid flicking cigarette butts and smoking near flam-
mable structures and materials.
Don't leave trash lying around. Garbage can easily catch
fire, soitshould always be fullycontainedintrashcansasafe
distance away from buildings.
Consider the risk of having a sofa on your porch.
Although there is currently no city ordinance banning
upholstered furniture on porches, DPS advises against
keeping sofas, armchairs and other upholstery outdoors
due to their flammable nature.
Have an evacuation plan. Know the exits in your build-
ing and prepare a back-up plan in case flames block usual
escape routes. Hold practice fire drills to make sure all
residents know how to get out safely.
Keep escape routes clear. Ensure that doorways and win-
dows are not blocked and avoid putting large objects in hall-
ways because they can impede your exit in the case of a fire.
Check your smoke detectors. Verify that there is at least
one smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector on each
floor of your home. Test the devices often to find out if the
batteries are working. Be sure to leave all smoke detectors
uncovered, plugged in and turned on.
In the case of a fire, it is essential to act quickly and
decisively. If you smell smoke and are unsure of its source,
immediately evacuate the buildingyou are in and informthe
police or fire department of the situation. Also, always trust
your smoke detectors - never presume that a fire drill is
taking place or that the alarm is malfunctioning. This advice
may seem obvious and redundant, as we have all heard fire
safety tips countless times since childhood, yet in light of
Saturday's tragic events, we are reminded that it is better to
be proactive than reactive when dealing with fire.
As always, if you note any suspicious behavior on cam-
pus, contact DPS at (734) 763-1131. For suspicious behavior
off campus, contact the Ann Arbor Police Department Tip *
Line at (734) 794-6939. For all emergencies, dial 9-1-L

Position battles aplenty
for 'M' in spring practice

By JOE STAPLETON
Daily Sports Writer
While depth is a concern at
most positions for the Michigan
football team, running back is not
one of them.
The Wolver- NOTEBOOK
ines lost Bran-
don Minor and
Carlos Brown - the team's two
leading ballcarriers last year with
96 and 81 carries, respectively -
but they still have plenty of talent
at the position.
As of now, sophomore Mike Cox
and junior Michael Shaw are split-
ting the majority of the reps with
the first team. Shaw is more experi-
enced and had 29 more carries last
year'than Cox, but Cox made the
most of his opportunities - his 8.7
yards per carry led the team.
Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez said on Tuesday that the two
front-runners are relatively even.
"Mike Cox has been pretty
solid," Rodriguez said. "Mike
Shaw has had a couple really good
days and a couple days where we
expected more out of him, but he's
worked extremely hard."
Shaw and Cox are merely
two parts of what should be an

Daily Sports Writer
It was redshirt senior outfielder
Nick Urban who made the play
with the
bases C. MICHIGAN 7
loaded in MICHIGAN 13
the third
inning. He belted a line drive to
center field, bringing in both red-
shirt junior Anthony Toth and
sophomore Coley Crank for two
runs.
The stage for Urban's double
and the Wolverines' big third
inning was set up just before
Michigan began its six-run rally,
eventually culminating in its 13-7
win Central Michigan yesterday.
Toth started off the scoring with a
single to right center that brought
in freshman shortstop Derek
Dennis. A wild pitch by Chippe-
was left-hander Bryce Morrow
allowed freshman outfielder Pat-
rick Biondi to run in for the score.
"Usually, the team that scores
more than three runs in one
inning is going to come out with
the win," Michigan coach Rich
Maloney said. "So any time you
get the double is great. We were
struggling getting that man in
from third base and Nick was able
to do that for us."
With Toth on third and Crank

on second, it was the perfect time
for a big hit. Senior first baseman
Mike Dufek attempted, but struck
out looking and junior outfielder
Ryan LaMarre walked.
So, Urban provided the answer
when he drove home two runs.
Dennis and senior third baseman
Mike Kittle followed suit, tally-
ing one RBI each, and Michigan
ended the third inning with a five-
run lead.
But Central didn't let down,
responding with two quick runs
in the top of the fourth. With only
a three-run advantage, Michi-
gan switched up its pitchers in
an effort to hold off a Chippewa
comeback.
Junior right-hander Travis
Smith took the mound in relief
of redshirt junior pitcher Matt
Gerbe.
Although Smith didn't throw
particularly well, the Wolverines
still managed to get the next out
on a ground ball.
Michigan then scored two more
runs in the bottom of the fourth to
regain a comfortable lead. Both
teams scored another four runs,
but the Wolverine lead was never
in serious jeopardy.
LaMarre brought in one of
those Michigan runs on a single to
center field, in his first game back
in the lineup since late February

due to a broken thumb, which he
suffered against Texas Tech.
"It was a lot of fun to get out
there and get a few at-bats under
my belt before the weekend,"
LaMarre said. "Really, I just tried
to loosen things up, but it definite-
ly was a lot better than watching
the game."
As expected, LaMarre was a
little rusty to start, striking out on
his first at-bat. But he showed his
resiliency by getting a hit, a run
and an RBI on the day.
"Ryan hasn't seen any game
pitches in five or six weeks," Malo-
ney said. "He has been hitting at
balls thrown by me in practice,
but by no means are those break-
ing balls."
While he may not be at 100 per-
cent, LaMarre is making progress.
He was fortunate to return to the
lineup against Central - a team
that is not a Big Ten competitor,
but has established a recent histo-
ry with the Wolverines. Michigan
has lost two games to the Chippe-
was in the past two seasons.
"We haven't beat Central since
I've been here, so it was good,"
LaMarre said. "These games are
kind of tough, especially when
you don't know, with the weather,
if you're going to be able to play or
not. It was good focus and we just
got on top early and stayed there."

Fraternity brothers shave heads
to raise money for cancer'patients

Sigma Phi Epsilon
raised $7,400 for
pediatric cancer
research
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
While many students sacrifice
their time and money for charity,
one fraternity decided they would
donate something a bit more per-
sonal.
Forty-one Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity brothers had their heads
shaved by Noggins' barbershop
volunteers yesterday afternoon
to raise money and awareness for
pediatric cancer.
LSA junior Josh Palka, event
organizer for Sig Ep, said so far,
the fraternity has raised $7,400
for the St. Baldrick's Foundation
- a California-based organiza-
tion that works with volunteers
who shave their heads in order to
raise funds for pediatric cancer
research.
LSA freshman Charlie Zeller,
chief of marketing for the event,
said the fraternity has raised the
money through optional personal
donations. Many of the brothers
have been raising money for the
past month by contacting friends
and family, in addition to bucket-
ing outside the event for specta-
tors who want to donate to the
cause.
The idea for the event came
from one of their members who

COLLISION
From Page 1A
the after-effects produced by the
collision are captured by detectors,
allowing researchers to analyze
data long after the particles decay.
Physics Prof. Bing Zhou said the
particles in the beam must be held
in the precise orbit by magnets
in order for head-on collisions to
occur, adding that one interesting
event is observed about every 100
trillion collisions.
"We're looking for whatever
nature provides," Chapman said.
"We're using the well-known equa-
tion from Einstein. So if you put
enough energy into the collision,
you can make anything that nature
manifests."
The University is the largest con-
tributor to the development of the
ATLAS detector, one of the four
detectors situated along the 17-mile
stretch, Zhou said. The ATLAS
serves as a general-purpose mea-
sure of the particle collisions.
Zhou said University research-
ers helped design and operate the
ATLAS detector at CERN and that
muchofthe datagatheredby ATLAS
is processed at the University.
Chapman said the accelerator is
currently running at low collision
rates and will steadily increase once
physicists and workers at CERN
become more familiar with how it
works.
"At the moment, we're not look-
ing at very many events of the inter-

estingtype,"he said. "It willbecome
very exciting when we get to higher
collision rates and that is where the
interestingphysics is."
Chapman said reaching the
LHC's full performance capacity is
a step-by-step process. The current
challenge is to ensure that every-
thing is functioning properly. He
added that.over the next few weeks,
researchers will begin to ramp up
the number of proton bunches -
groups of positively charged par-
ticles - ineach beam.
Zhou said the ultimate goal of
creating the high-energy collisions
is to uncover features of the Stan-
dard Model in particle physics that
have thus far only been the subject
of speculation.
The model, she said, theorizes
that all particles with mass are cre-
ated from an interaction with the
Higgs boson - a theoretical par-
ticle that many researchers hope to
detect through the LHC collisions.
"Only when you have energy high
enough ... can you recreate such a
particle in the laboratory," Zhou
said.
Chapman said the discovery of
the Higgs boson would require con-
siderable preliminary analysisbut is
feasible through the LHC.
"The first thing we'll do is to look
for those things we already know
about," Chapman said. "Then (we'll)
begin to look for things that are
speculated but haven't been seen."
Chapman added: "This machine
is our best guess as to how to do
that."

LSA senior Andrew O'Brien, Engineering freshman Dominic Lefere, and LSA junior Blake Ivers get their heads shaved for a
Sigma Phi Upsilon fundraiser for Saint Baldricks, an organization that raises money for pediatric cancer research.

had participated in a similar event
in his high school, Zeller said.
"We were looking for a philan-
thropic event to raise money for a
charity that our fraternity could
put on," he said.
Palka said the fraternity does
a lot of philanthropic work and
found this form of community ser-
vice to be the "ultimate way of giv-
ing back."
"Beingbald is going to show for
a while after the event is over and
will raise awareness for kids with
cancer to a lot of people," Palka
said.
Thefraternityhopes tonakethis
event an annual one, Zeller said.
"We want Sig Ep to be known

for putting on this event," he said.'
"It's such a great cause and we
want to be able to raise that money
for something worthwhile."
Palka said having his head
shaved is going to take some get-
ting used to but that the benefits
for the charity outweigh the aes-
thetics.
"I'm sure it's going to be weird
to feel my head and looking like a
Q-tipbut a lot of (kids with cancer)
don't get the pleasure of getting
their hair grown back because of
the chemotherapy," he said. "It's a
small sacrifice for us."
Palka said his cousin passed
away at the age of four from can-
cer and that participating in this

event is a way to give back to those
in need.
Though he doesn't have person-
al experience with pediatric can-
cer, Zeller said it still hits "close to
home" since his father had cancer
several years ago and is now in
remission.
Zeller said he doesn't have any
concerns about being bald for a
while.
"I'm over the fact that it might
not look the best," he said. "Since
it's for such a great cause hope-
fully people will ask me why my
head's shaved and I'll be able to
tell them about it and raise even
more awareness and possibly get
even more donations."

fatal blaze at the State Street house
as a "homicide-type investigation."
Chamberlain, however, said
AAFD officials cannot offer an
opinion as to the cause of the fires
at this point.
"There's no evidence to make a
decision at this time," Chamber-
lain said.
The AAFD's decision will only
arrive after a thorough departmen-
tal investigation into the causes of

the fires, according to Chamber-
lain.
That investigation started last
Saturday when firefighters on the
scenes used a trained dog to search
for remnants of liquid accelerants
that would have suggested arson,
Chamberlain said.
According to Chamberlain, the
dog found no trace of accelerants.
"The dog did not identify any
specific accelerant," Chamberlain
said.
AAFD officials also plan to con-
duct further tests on evidence from
the scenes of the blazes to see if

accelerants were used, Chamber-
lain said. She added that witness
accounts of the fires will also play a
big part in her department's inves-
tigation.
"We're trying to use all of our
resources," Chamberlain said.
But according to Chamberlain,
the results ofAAFD's investigation
won't be available for a while.
"It's a huge investigation pro-
cess," Chamberlain said. "After
that investigation, we make a deci-
sion."
According to the AAPD ser-
geant, the AAFD's ultimate deci-

sion doesn't affect the police
investigation.
The AAFD "can say what they
like, but they're not police investi-
gators," the sergeant said.
According to the sergeant, the
police investigation will continue
based on the assumption that the
fires were arsons.
"Given what you can surmise
from what happened that night
I would say any reasonable per-
son could deduce what caused the
fires," the sergeant said. "As far
as we're looking at it, it wasn't an
accident."

the ethics policies of the companies
they endorse every day.
One member of the audience
shrugged, saying "not really." But
across the room, another student
responded that she cared and a dia-
logue began.
Fitting in with Schuyler's inten-
tion for the presentation, students
began expressing their opinions
about the pressing and complex
issue of corporate ethics. Schuyler
said companies are trying to "fig-
ure out" whether consumers care
about the corporate responsibility
of companies they encounter regu-
larly.
"There is definitely starting to
be that correlation between people
who pick brands based on what
they're doing good," she said.
Schuyler used Toyota and Star-
bucks to exemplify the impact of
maintaining the appearance of a
"do-good" corporation.
She said that though Toyota had
a massive safety recall and was
slapped with the National High-
way Traffic Safety Administra-
tion's highest penalty for a failure
to report a severe safety issue, a
progressive and earth-friendly rep-
utation has kept them afloat in the
minds of consumers.
"Because they weren't this
company that was all-out to make
money and forget everything else,
they're getting a little bit more lee-
way," she said. "What attaches to
your brand does pay off."
Schuyler also discussed how

date to run for a U.S. Senate seat in
New York this fall, Ford dropped
out of the race last month, cit-
ing pressure from the Democratic
Party not to contest the spot cur-
rently held by Democratic Sen.
Kirsten Gillibrand.
Ford, who served as congress-
man for Tennessee's ninth con-
gressional district from 1997 to
2007, cited potentially detrimental
effects forthe Democrats as a main
reason for deciding not to pursue a
bid for the Senate.
"If I run, the likely result would
be a brutal and highly negative
Democratic primary - a primary
where the winner emerges weak-
ened and the Republican strength-
ened," Ford wrote in a March
1 op-ed piece in The New York
Times. "I refuse to do anything
that would help Republicans win a

Senate seat in New York, and give
the Senate majority to the Repub-
licans."
But this wasn't the first time
Ford made a play for a Senate seat.
Ford ran for Senate in 2006 los-
ing the election to Republican Bob
Corker after Corker ran ads against
Ford that many criticized as racial-
ly charged.
In his speech yesterday, Ford
also promoted his desire for an
open primary system, in which
candidates would be allowed to
run for office without having to
declare themselves as Demo-
crats or Republicans. He said
that oftentimes those who do not
affiliate with a party are unable
to have their views heard because
the majority of audiences tend
towards columnists and talk show
hosts who express opinions that

are either extremely liberal or
extremely conservative.
"There is no doubt that those
people deserve a voice, but they
shouldn't drown out the rest of the
country which I believe find them-
selves situated somewhere in the
middle," he said.
Ford also spoke directly to
current Public Policy students,
encouraging them not tp be dis-
suaded by political agendas that
have hampered government's abil-
ity to provide meaningful change
to its citizens.
"One of the challenges for this
generation of public policy school
graduates is to not be confined by,
or not allow the current dogma or
current conversation to limit your
thinking about answers to big pub-
lic policy problems confronting the
nation," Ford said.

idea of the direct loan program and
I brought that in and developed
it with other colleagues to get it
enacted, which we did," Butts said.
"But we were never able to achieve
the goal of transforming the stu-
dent loan programs into one pro-
gram that worked well for students
and schools and taxpayers until the
(recent overhaul) bill was passed."
Butts said another key feature
of the new legislation is its real-
location of federal funding toward
education and the increase in the
amount of money available for
grants.
"One of the things that's most
important about (the bill) isn't nec-
essarily that direct lending is now
in place, but the fact that it has
redirected well over $60 billion to
education programs and a variety
of other things, particularly Pell
Grants." Butts said. "Thatis a major
accomplishment."
The bill - together with the
health care bill signed by Obama
on the same day - aims to save tax-
payers an estimated $61billion over
10 years by getting rid of bank sub-
sidies. As outlined by the legisla-
tion, the conserved funds will then
go toward increasing student loans
through Pell Grants, health care
reform and reducing the national
deficit.
The legislation also eradicates
the Federal Family Education Loan
Program at colleges across the
country and replaces it with the
Direct Loan Program, allowing the
federal government to give loans
directly to students without banks
serving as middlemen.
Butts called this a historic piece
of legislation for the country and a
"transformational moment in the
history of financing student finan-
cial aid." He compared it to past
student aid initiatives that are still
in place today like the establish-
ment of the National Defense Stu-
dent Loan Program - now known
as the Perkins Loan - in 1958, the
work study and supplemental grant
program founded in 1965 and the
Pell Grant program established in
1972.
Margaret Rodriguez - senior
associate director of the Univer-
sity's Office of Financial Aid -
worked in the Office of Financial
Aid while Butts was in Washing-
ton developing the pilot program.
After he successfully launched the
program and secured a spot for the
University among the 100 schools
chosen for the initiative, Rodriguez
took on the role of implementing
the program on campus.
Rodriguez said for many years,
she and her colleagues were work-
ing toward incorporating a direct
student lending system to the
financial aid process for University
students.
"Many of us in the financial aid
office at the time had advocated
for the program because we felt it
was a better way to provide fed-
eral loans to students and certainly
cheaper for the taxpayers," Rodri-
guez said.
While the University won't be
seeing many changes in terms of
student lending as a result of the
bill, Rodriguez said students will
still benefit from increased funding
for the Pell Grant program, as well
as the expansion of eligibility. The
Department of Education recently
issued a payment schedule for the

Pell Grant program that will go
into effect in the fall, she said.
"We're going to see some imme-

diate benefits from that," Rodri-
guez said.
Edie Goldenberg, a Public Policy
professor, wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that the increase in funding
for Pell Grants will provide assis-
tance to universities who are cur-
rently using money out oftheir own
budgets to give more financial aid
to students.
"Universities that were meet-
ing financial need with internal
resources should experience some
relief in their financial aid dollars,"
she said.
The legislation also includes the
Income Based Repayment Plan,
which will allow students who
enter a job in the public service sec-
tor to pay a maximum of 15 percent
of their income toward loans, with
any remaining debt being forgiven
following 10 years of work.
Rodriguez said she thinks the
program will play an important
role in allowing students to chose
a career based on interest, rather
than selecting one based solely on
salary in order to pay off student
loans.
"I certainly do think it will be
an effective initiative and that it
is a wonderful option to be able to
offer students who are repaying
their loans so that their employ-
ment choices can be made with less
regard to what their student loan
burden is," Rodriguez said.
Ultimately, Rodriguez said she
thinks this has been something
that students and policy makers
have been anticipating for years
and she was happy to see it finally
pass through the United States
Senate.
"I think it has been a long time
coming," Rodriguez said. "I think
the House was very forward-think-
ing in passing this legislation last
fall, and we're glad that it was able
to be passed through the Senate."
Pamela Fowler, executive direc-
tor of the University's Financial
Aid Office, mirrored Rodriguez's
sentiments and said she is glad
to finally see the bill become law
after working toward it over the
years.
"We have worked long and hard
since the Clinton administration,
when this program began, to have
the direct loan program nation-
wide," Fowler said. "For those of us
that have been working really hard
to support the direct loan program,
we're ,very happy that this has
finally come to pass."
The switch from a bank-centric
system to direct loans means the
legislation will be detrimental to
banks as they begin losing profits
they previously garnered from the
student loans, according to Gold-
berg. And while bank executives
will be upset with those lawmakers
who helped pass the legislation, it
will ultimately be a positive situa-
tion for the nation, she wrote.
"The losers here are the banks,
which were realizing profits while
the federal government was assum-
ing the risk," Goldenberg wrote.
"Major banks will not be happy
with the Democrats, but they
already tend to support Republi-
cans anyway."
Despite angry responses from
some Republicans and other oppo-
nents of the legislation, Butts said
he thinks the legislation will even-
tually gain support all around,
much like the Pell Grant program
did in the 1970s.
"I think it's going to provide a
good, stable source of funding for
federal student loans and that ...

this program will gradually have
the support of all the participants
in higher education," Butts said.


TOREHAN SHARMAN/Daily
Shannon Schuyler of PriceWaterhouseCooper talks to students at the Ross School of Business yesterday. Schuyler is the man-
aging director of corporate responsibility at the firm and a University alm.

the issue of brand-responsibility
holds a great deal of importance
on both the corporate and indi-
vidual level.
In an interview before the pre-
sentation, Schuyler said that new
graduates entering the workforce
are a brand in themselves.
"People need to be savvy to have
their own brand and figure out
what that is," Schuyler said.
She added that new graduates
need to have an "unwavering"
foundation of ethics and realize
that every member of a company is
responsible and important.
"You do make an impact," she

said. "One person can make a dif-
ference."
Schuyler said she recommends
that young talent understand how
much power they truly have, but
warns against "flaunting" it.
"You have to know that you have
that power going in," she said.
Schuyler said one of the main
reasons corporations are spend-
ing more of their resources on
their philanthropic endeavors is to
attract young talent.
"We know that 92 percent of
undergrads specifically look for a
company that is socially responsi-
ble. We know that MBA's will take

up to $14,000 less to join a company
that is responsible," Schuyler said.
"We know that 4 out of 5 employ-
ees will stay longer if we do these
things."
She explained that corpora-
tions are beginning to change their
ethics policies and are altering
their strategies to be more geared
towards philanthropy. Aside from
appealing to a more socially con-
scious talent pool, Schuyler said
corporations are taking on more
responsibility simply because it's
the right thing to do.
"It makes sense that we're giving
back," she said.

Her world
By Stcphen I. Neshitt I Daily Sports Writcr

aureen Moody, an
uneven bars specialist
on the No. 6 Michigan
women's gymnastics team, often
goes head over heels while swing-
ing in the gym, but it was during
Thanksgiving break in 2008 when
her life was flipped upside down.
Her father, Kevin Moody, was
diagnosed with terminal metastat-
ic pancreatic cancer after going to
the hospital for a blood clot in his
leg.. Doctors told him he had six
months to live.
Kevin held on for eight months,
cherishing every last moment with
his family.
Her older brother, Nolan Moody,
was a senior pitcher for the Michi-
gan State Spartans at the time of
the diagnosis - an event that began
a roller-coaster ride for the two
athletes, home for the holidays.
Their father's medical diagnosis
began a roller-coaster ride for the
two athletes, home for the holidays.
"It was really tough - surprising
more than anything," Nolan said. "I
think that whole weekend was so
surreal, just going in for a blood clot
and leaving with terminal cancer, it
just catches you off-guard.
"Certainly the most difficult
break from school that any of us
could've had, but the good thing
was that we were able to be home
and together as a family. It was a

very difficult time for those eight
months, and it is at times today as
well."
Kevin, a former three-sport
athlete at Kalamazoo College who
practiced law in East Lansing,
resolved to devote his last months
to watching his kids play the sports
they loved. And alongside his wife
Nancy, he did just that, missing
only a handful of events.
The couple traveled across the
. country to watch both gymnastics
and baseball. Although his health
kept him from attending the event,
Kevin was watching on TV as Mau-
reen's Wolverines captured their
third consecutive Big Ten title last
March. She posted a career-high
9.900 on the bars.
He was sitting in the stands as his
son pitched Michigan State's first
no-hitter since 1993 against North-
western last April. When Nolan
stepped off the mound, he found his
father and the two embraced, tears
in their eyes.
Kevin's goal was simple: he
wanted tobe there for everything.
"My dad didn't want a lot of
attention on his illness," Maureen
said. "So the attention turned to
my brother and his baseball and
my gymnastics. My parents tried as
hard as they could to make it to my
meets and his games."
Battling against the odds, Kevin

survived through both sports' sea-
sons, even living to see his son sign
with the Detroit Tigers - Nolan's
first step toward achieving his
childhood dream.
Each meet or ballgame was a
testament to Kevin's fortitude and
dedication.
"I know watching Maureen is
one of my favorite things to do, and
it was one of his too," Nolan said.
"And watching me play baseball is
the same for him, Maureen and my

yet been signed and Nancy had
stopped working - the Moody
family was soaking in every last
moment together.
Nolan reported to Lakeland, Fla.
for his assignment for the Tigers
organization in mid-July, and that's
when his father's health took a turn
for the worst.
On July 19, 2009, Kevin passed
away at home. Although his death
was expected, it wasn't easy.
Maureen was devastated by her

tics .,, she would have to restart

mom. I think that having athletics
for those eight months was sort of
therapeutic for everybody."
Although she had spent the pre-
vious two summers in Ann Arbor,
Maureen decided to move back
home for the summer of 2009 to
stay with her family as her father's
life slowly ebbed away.
For a six-week period both kids
were home - when Nolan hadn't

father's passing. In the aftermath,
returning to gymnastics for her
senior year was hard to envision.
"I just didn't feel like myself,"
Maureen said. "I didn't feel ambi-
tious at all, and didn't think I could
muster the energy and enthusiasm
to come back for another year."
Her teammates and coaches
attended the funeral, and it took all
of their support to coax "Mo" back
into the gym.
But it was Nancy and Nolan
who played the biggest role in this
difficult time.
"After my dad died, it was tough
on everybody," Nolan said. "When
we talked (Maureen) said she
didn't have the drive, the emotion
or the energy that is required to do
big-time athletics, but as much as
I sympathized with that, I knew
that one of the best things that
helped me cope was getting back
to playing baseball and talking to
teammates that IShad in college.
"I told her that sports can be
a lot of things, and I think one of
them is a way to fill your mind
with something and move on and
have fun," Nolan added. "I think
she knew all along that she want-
ed to go back to gymnastics, but
she knew it was just going to be
extremely difficult because she

would have to restart and find a
way to have that drive again, and
she's found it now, I have no doubt
about that."
Even after taking the entire sum-
mer off from training, Maureen
picked up right where she left off
with the help of her team, regaining
her spot as one of the Wolverines'
strongest gymnasts on bars.
On Friday, March 12, before
the final home meet this season
- senior night - Maureen stood
beside her mother on the floor at
Crisler Arena as Michigan coach
Bev Plocki spoke of the senior's
accomplishments.
Both mother and daughter stood
strong as Plocki named off the
awards - two-time All-Big Ten,
two-time U-M Athletic Achieve-
mentAward andthe BigTen Sports-
manship Award - but when she
explained the void on Maureen's
other side, the gymnast broke down.
Maureen bowed her head and
tears fell down her face. Nancy
pulled her daughter into an
embrace and the coaches gathered
around her.
There she was, broken and hurt-
ing, but surrounded with love and
support.
"Bev had extremely nice things
to say, and I was truly touched by
it," Maureen said. "Standing out
there with just my mom was really
hard, of course, because it made me
think of my dad. But it was great to
look back at my four years and think
about how wonderful it's been. I
was just so thankful that I could
share that moment with my mom."
"She has shown courage and
dedication unlike I've experienced
in my coaching career," Plocki said
of Maureen in front of the Crisler
Arena crowd. "Maureen, I speak
for myself, the coaches and your
teammates as I say that you are an
inspiration for all of us, and we are
so proud of you."
As Plocki's final words trailed
off, the crowd of 5,042 rose to their
feet.
Maureen and the rest of the Wol-
verines dried their eyes and defeat-
ed No. 5 Georgia, 196.375-195.800.
Moody finished up her career at
home by posting a runner-up score
of 9.850.

After winning this year's Big
Ten Championships in Columbus
on March 27, Maureen hopped up
onto the podium with her fellow
seniors and grabbed hold of the tro-
phy. They all stuck four fingers in
the air.
They had been there before, but
their fourth conference title in as
many years was something special
for Maureen in particular.
After a year of tragedy, doubt
and uncertainty, Maureen couldn't
have been more thrilled.
"We were just so excited," Mau-
reen said. "I think that this year, in
comparison with my other years,
we've been more focused and deter-
mined to win. All of the teams get
great support and school spirit, and
it's always a fierce competition that
is usually really close score-wise,
and it was alotoffun. I've never felt
that excited for a conference meet."
Both siblings are living out their
dreams, and though their paths took
a foul twist, they still stand strong.
only eight months after she con-
sidered leaving gymnastics, Mau-
reen is helping her team on the
national scene, as the Wolverines
enter the NCAA Regionals this Sat-
urday.
As Nolan looks on from Florida,
he knows his sister made the right
decision.
"I'm proud of her for taking on
that challenge and getting back
into it," Nolan said. "Michigan is
the school Maureen always wanted
to go to, I remember her talking
about it in middle school, so to get
to go there and be able to contrib-
ute to that team on bars and have
some really good scores for them is
great."
Recovery will be a long and pain-
ful road for the Moodys, but as they
have made strides to come to terms
with the hand they've been dealt,
the family has learned that when
tragedy strikes, the bond of a com-
mon passion - athletics - can hold $
things together.
The NCAA Championships will
be held on April 22.in Gainesville,
Fla., two hours away from Lake-
land, and you can bet Nolan, the
Spartan, will be there fully clad in
maize and blue to cheer on his sis-
ter.

Educating and Inspiring since 1912

By EMILY BONCHI
DailySports Writer.
In a year of letdown seasons,
surprise comeback losses and bro-
ken hearts, Michigan sports are in
an unusual position.
The women's tennis team is
having a different type of year as
well - except it's breaking records
instead of hearts.
The Wolverines are currently
ranked No. 3 in the nation, the
highest ranking in program his-
tory. Prior to this year, the highest
rank the team had ever held was 16.
The Wolverines (5-0 Big Ten, 15-3
overall) haven't had a conference
start this strong since 1997, when
the team wentundefeated through
10 matches in Big Ten play.
With the way the team is play-
ing, the Wolverines are heading
in the direction of repeating the
program's 1996-1997 season, when
Michigan took first place in the Big
Ten and made it to the third round
of the NCAA Tournament.
"We have agroup thatreallygets
along well," Michigan coach Ronni
Bernstein said. "They believe in
each other and push each other
and work really hard. We feel like
we could play with anybody."
Michigan first made history
when it earned a berth to the ITA
National Team Indoor Champion-
ships last February, a tournament
hosted in Madison for 16 of the
country's top teams. It was the

first time in school history Michi-,
gan had ever been invited, and it
was a successful jump-off point
for what's been a thriving spring
season so far. r
"I think we were able to see a
lot of the top teams in the nation
(at the indoor championships),".
senior Tania Mahtani said. "We
saw in the tournament that we
were right at their level, which was
a great motivator for the rest of our
season."
Over the past two months, the
Wolverines have broken several
other program records. The team
had its first win over a top-10 team
back on Feb. 13 against then-No. 6
Miami. Michigan then set another
record by defeating its first top-
five rival on Feb. 26, beating then-
No. 5 Baylor.
After five consecutive road
games and seven consecutive
wins, the women's tennis team
faced its biggest obstacle yet last
weekend - then-No. 4 North-
western.
Northwestern - which fin-
ished No. 1 in 2008 and No. 2 in
2009 - had 81 consecutive wins
over Big Ten opponents coming
into the match against Michigan
last Saturday, while the Wolver-
ines were just breaking into the
top 10 for the first time ever. It was
also the only Big Ten team Michi-
gan coach Ronni Bernstein hadn't
beaten since she started coaching
at Michigan in 2007.

If history repeated itself, the
Wildcats would earn win number*
82.
But, Michigan made program
history once again - one-upping a
previous success for another time
this season - defeating North-
western for the first time since
1997. This was also Michigan's '
first conference match in which
both teams were ranked in the top
10.
Junior team captain Whitney
Taney has proved herself a leader
of the team, stepping up in several
matches this season. However,
she attributes their success to the
bond the players share.
"We all believe in each other on
every single court," Taney said.
"We believe as a team that we can
do it and that we can get the job
done."
Looking ahead, the Wolverines
have a few more firsts on the hori-
zon. They have never hosted the
first or second round of the NCAA
Tournament, but if they stay on
track, that could happen this year 0
as well.
The ultimate first for the wom-
en's tennis team, however, would
be the program's first national
championship.
"Winning a national champion-
ship would be the top goal," Bern-
stein said. "But we're just going to
continue one match at a time and
hopefully end up with some more
firsts."

Naturally, the idea of walking into a
well lit classroom, mounting a stage and,
disrobing in front of a group of University
students doesn't appeal to everyone. Nude
modeling pays well, though, and it offers
an unorthodox employment opportunity
in a college town where part-time work
can be excruciatingly normal.
Nude modeling gigs at the University
are available to students and non-stu-
dents alike, and while many models came
to pose after hearing about the money-
making endeavor through friends, others
stumbled upon it as a new avenue to self-
enrichment.
In the case of Steve Cunningham, a
57-year-old electrician from Hazel Park,
nude figure modeling was the beginning
of an entire new career. After suffer-
ing a minor heart attack and undergoing
a quintuple bypass surgery four years
ago, Cunningham parted ways with the
Detroit-area communications companyhe
had worked at for years and began model-
ing as often as possible.
"My wife suggested - because I was in
pretty good shape and had good balance,
having been a student of yoga for a while
- that I might try figure modeling," Cun-
ningham said.
For Cunningham, who half-jokingly
refers to himself as a "minimalist when
it comes to clothes," the move paid off.
Instructors were impressed with his
knack for modeling, and through referrals
he quickly found himself modeling for art
classes at more than a dozen schools and
institutions throughout Southeast Michi-
gan, includingthe University. Henow gets
booked for about eight three-hour model-
ing sessions in a given week, and he's come
to appreciate the job because it forces him
* to keep his body in shape.
"I'm at that age where the phrase 'use it
or lose it' is no longer academic," he dead-

panned.
In Cirocco's case, nude modeling
offers the chance to interface with art

"I really am inter-
ested in helping people
learn how to do art," she said.
"This was another way for me to
offer myself, to show people adifferent
skill and to help the students learn how to
draw better."
When she's not modeling, Cirocco com-
mits her time to the Prison Creative Arts
Project, through which she gets another
chance to contribute to the conception of
art by assisting prisoners with writing.
Nude modeling offers her something dif-
ferent, though, because it allows her to
challenge her self image.
"Growing up, I always had body-image
issues, and Ithink Iovercame alotofthose
in college," she explained. -"And model-
ing - being naked in a room full of people
who are looking at you really closely and
drawing all of your imperfections - was
a way for me to sort of conquer that, once
and for all."
of course, not allmodels approach their
work with such personal conviction, even
if they take the job seriously.
"Well, it pays pretty well, especially
for the type of job you can get in col-
lege,". admitted School of Music, Theater
& Dance senior Jacob Merkin, alluding to
the $I5-an-hour wage paid to models by
the University.
"I'm a fan of mindless labor," he noted.
That ability to embrace mindlessness
of modeling suits him and his colleagues
well, because three-hour modeling ses-
sions can be an exercise in brain starva-
tion and sensory deprivation. Simply,
modeling can be quite boring.
More than self confidence and social
courage, what models depend on to sur-
vive a posing session is a creative mind
capable of keeping itself stimulated. The
strategies vary, but the models all have a
few go-to methods for preserving their
sanity while they arrest their motion in
the center of the classroom.
For Merkin, who nonchalantly
described the experience as "relaxing,"
the cerebral downtime in the studio
allows him to be surprisingly productive.

DIAG PIZZA & SUBS

Some people are averse to the idea of
buying pizza from a place that sells ciga-
rettes, booze and condoms. Well those
people are missing out on the experi-
ence of a lifetime. Diag Pizza betrays all
expectations, with perfect cheese melti-
ness and sauce allocation. Who knew that
some of the best pizza in Ann Arbor could
be so amazingly cheap? We did.
POOR MAN'S PI
PIZZA HUT EXPRESS
Sorry guys, but the entire concept of
a "personal pizza" is the biggest rip-off
in the food industry. You're paying more
money for what amounts to two bland,
pre-cooked slices, justifying your pur-
chase with the illusion that it's an entire
pizza. The Union's Pizza Hut Express
churns out these puppies like nobody's
business. Stick with the breadsticks.

BACKROOM PIZZA
Thin crust cooked just enough for a
satisfying crunch. Smooth tomato sauce
gently blending under layers of melt-
in-your-mouth cheese. And those neon
lights beckoning, spelling out "Spinach
pie!" Fish out that crumpled $1 bill from
your jeans pocket and slide into Back-
room Pizza bliss ... and then you sober
up. Ick.
ZZA
NYPD
Let's talk White Pizza. NYPD's sauce-
less wonder tastes just as good at 6 p.m.
as it does at 3 a.m. And while it does lack
the sauce, it more than makes up for it in
cheese (including delicious, gooey pil-
lows of ricotta). And the garlic. Oh, the
garlic. Combine all that with a delight-
fully crispy crust, and NYPD nears pizza
perfection.

CAMPUS CLASH
LAST WEEK'S RESULTS:
It's been a bit of a while since the MSA website was last seen, but here it
comes to battle Google Fiber in our final Campus Clash. But this battle does
not happen in our arena. It happens ... on the Interwebs! The MSA sends one
of its many file errors to Google Fiber, but Fiber is too fast, and evades. Then
Google Fiber retaliates by flooding the MSA website with ads catered
specifically to its interests. The MSA site is paralyzed, looking at all the
relevant ads. While the MSA site is busy, Google Fiber stabs it in the face.
WINNER: GOOGLE FIBER
That's it for the arena. We hope you had fun.

Tyra Banks taught
me model behavior

Groove Spoon found its name on an online random name generator.
One band, 10 musicians

Funky Groove Spoon
brings a big-band
feel to the 'U'
By ADDIE SHRODES
Daily Arts Writer
Ten distinct musicians stream
into a dingy basement crowded
with instru-
ments and Groove Spoon
sound equip-
ment on a Tomorrow
sleepy Tuesday at 9 p.m.
night. Yet the The Blind Pig
somber walls Tickets from $7
begin to buzz
as the collective energy reaches a
crescendo.
And the band hasn't even started
jamming.
This might be your typical band
practice space, but Groove Spoon is
certainly not your typical band.
Drummer Jack Stratton, a Music,
Theatre&Dance senior, started the
band about two years ago, but this
year Groove Spoon went through
an overhaul.
The band sculpted its self-
described funk music with the
addition of eight members, includ-
ing Engineering senior Nathan
Zukoff, who books the band's gigs.
LSA senior Antwaun Stanley
joined as lead vocalist after he took
a sound recording class with Strat-
ton and Zukoff, in which they col-
laborated on a class project that
would become one of the band's
singles, "Simple Step."
After adding Stanley, Stratton
filled out the band with people he
admired both musically and as per-
sonalities.
"It came down to who we want to
play with, but it also came down to
a who we want to be around," Strat-

ton explained. "There are some
musicians who are very emotional.
They're amazing to play with, but
you don't really want to be in a
basement with them once a week."
The band, made up exclusively
of University students, is now a
10-piece ensemble with vocals,
horns and a rhythm section includ-
ing guitar and bass. Stratton said 10
members is the minimum to pro-
duce "that big, live sound."
The key to "staying tight," Strat-
ton said, has been committing to
weekly rehearsals this year.
"Because everyone has such
expertise and creativity, the musi-
cal innovation that's happening is
unbelievable - everyone feeds off
each other," Zukoff said of rehears-
als. "It's the best group dynamic of
10 people I've ever seen."
"This is almost always the best
part of my week," said high brass
player Andy Warren, a senior in
Engineering and Music, Theatre &
Dance, of the rehearsals.
"Everyone gets along so well;
everyone's laughing and smiling all
the time," he added.
Each member feels lucky to be in
a 10-piece band, a size rare in itself,
that has such high quality and a
collaborative atmosphere.
"It's like working with some of
the best musicians on campus,"
LSA senior and backup vocalist
Hannah Winkler said.
"You feel like you should pay
to get into Groove Spoon," added
Music, Theatre & Dance junior and
backup vocalist Emily Berman.
Indeed, Groove Spoon is a
creative and social outlet for its
members, who come from various
departments at the University.
The vibe only intensifies dur-
ing the band's stage performances.
The band usually plays two to three
shows a month, including one in

the basement of Elmo's Main Street
T-Shirts. Band members surprise
the audience as well as each other
when they improvise on stage,
Winkler said.
"We're kind of like flipping out at
the cool things that each person is
doing," she said.
"I'm just constantly amazed at
the musicianship that's happen-
ing around me," added keyboardist
Michael Malis, a School of Music,
Theatre & Dance senior.
"It's way better than a 10-piece
bucket of chicken," Stanley said as
the room erupted into laughter.
And Stratton feels the audience
generally loves what Groove Spoon
does just as much as the members
do.
"This is the first band I've been
in where I'm pretty confident that
anyone who gets a glimpse is going
to dig it," he said. "That's justbased
on the (other) performers on stage,
and has nothing to do with my
drumming.
"I always feel like, 'Wow, if I
saw any of these cats (performing),
that'd be crazy.' And I've felt that
from the crowds too," he said.
For Groove Spoon, the process
of song creation and interpretation
is as collaborative as practice and
performance.
When the band reworks popular
music for a cover, one person starts
by arranging sheet music and from
there the interpretation begins.
Each section - rhythm, horns and
vocals - develops its own sound
in collaboration with the whole
group.
"There's a reference to the origi-
nal recording as well as a reference
to the fluidity of it, the fact that we
can mess with it," Malis said.
Groove Spoon's covers include
Earth, Wind & Fire's "Getaway,"

Daily Arts Writer
"America's Next Top Model"
has consistently been my favorite
TV show for the past five years,
and I don't think anything can be
done at this point to change that.
To explain the boundaries of my
obsession would perhaps frighten
awaythe casual television watcher.
Not only have I seen every single
episode from each of the 14 cycles
at least six times over, I have also
seen every single episode from the
international versions: Australia,
Canada, Germany and Britain.
Quite literally, this show is
taking over my life. Once, I was
watching an episode of "Gilmore
Girls" in which Luke's daughter
watches an episode of ANTM in
the background, and immediately
I yelled out, "cycle seven, episode
three!" I don't even remember
what the "Gilmore Girls" episode
was about. Last semester, I wrote
my Great Books paper on the
show, evaluating its coherence to
Aristotle's theory of tragedy, and
I'm seriously considering writing
my senior thesis on the relation
between the show's narrative dis-
course and story. And to bring my
creepiness full circle, I printed
out a (candid, might I add) picture
from my favorite contestant's Face-
book page and taped it on my wall
so I could see it every day. Some-
one came to my room and was like,
"Are those your friends?"
oh, how I wish.
And if you don't know what
ANTM is, please, please look up
"Tyra Banks freakout" on You-
Tube and tell me that's not the pin-
nacle of quality reality television.
In each cycle, Tyra Banks and
her sycophantic entourage of
fashion police bestow upon one
leggy ingenue the hallowed title of
"America's Next Top Model." Yet
the reality of the situation is so,
so much more than that. Pointless
drama about alarm clocks and sup-
posed racism? Check. "That skank
ho poured beer on my weave?"
Check. Complete stagnation of
modeling career upon ventur-
ing out in the real world? Double
check. ANTM isn't your typical
Project Runway bullshit, where
the designers actually make some-
thing out of themselves post-show.
Cycle-one winner Adrianne Curry
married a senile Brady and landed
herself a spread in Playboy. Classy?
I think so.
I've watched enough ANTM
to come up with some pieces of

of November in Banff, Alberta,
Canada.
When the Banff festival first
came to Ann Arbor, the films were
screened in Rackham Auditorium,
but today this venue is too small to
support the crowd. The audience
the festival attracts is getting big-
ger - and not just in Ann Arbor,
but all around the country.
"We are constantly receiv-
ing applications from groups and
organizations that would like to
bring the festival to their town.
Each year, we look at our tour
schedule and see if and where we
can squeeze in a few new shows,"
wrote Meagan Stewart, the world
tour program coordinator of the
festival, in an e-mail interview.
The film festival is sponsored
by the Banff Centre, a non-profit
institute which promotes moun-
tain-related arts and culture. The

Ann Arbor event is hosted by the
campus group Outdoor Adven-
tures.
Stewart stated that the festival
"inspires creativity in adventure
as well as filmmaking," furthering
the Banff Centre's mission. "The
films show ordinary people doing
extraordinary things."
Two of the festival's most popu-
lar films will screen in Ann Arbor:
"Take a Seat" and "First Ascent:
Alone on the Wall."
"Take a Seat" is a documentary
focusing on the experience of one
Dominic Gill, who also directed.
With a tandem bike, a camera
and a trailer, Gill traveled to the
northern coast of Alaska in 2006.
He desired to bike to the south-
ernmost tip of South America

finding strangers along the way
to help him pedal the 220-pound
bicycle. The film follows his two-
year journey over two continents.
The second movie, contrib-
uted by Sender Films, "First
Ascent: Alone at the Wall" follows
24-year-old Alex Honnold as he
prepares himself for the first free
solo climb of the Regular North-
west Face route on Yosemite's
Half Dome.
Eight films in total will pre-
miere at the festival on Sunday.
"We choose a wide array of films
for the Ann Arbor spot to appeal to
a wide range of people," wrote Jea-
nette Stawski, director of outdoor
Adventures, in an e-mail interview
with the Daily. "They touch on a

variety of topics, including biking,
boating, hiking, travel, skiing and
animals."
Each year, the festival receives
more than 300 film submissions.
"The films come from more than
35 countries and range from pro-
ductions created by high school
students to professional crews
working with companies like the
BBC and National Geographic,"
Stewart wrote.
In addition to agrand prize, seven
other awards are distributed at the
festival,including a Climbing award,
a Short-Mountain Film (under
fifteen minutes) award and Fea-
ture-Length Mountain Film (docu-
mentary or fiction) award. There is
also a People's Choice Award, select-
ed by audience members.
After the Banff competition,
25 films are selected for the world
tour. These films vary in style and
theme, from climbing and kayak-
ing to adventure, culture and the
environment.
The world tour circles the globe,
hitting countries in Europe, South
America and Asia. In total, about
200,000 people attend 500 screen-
ings in 285 locations. This year, the
festival will visit approximately
140 cities in the U.S. alone. In each
location, the host organization
picks films from the pool of 25 to
cater to its unique audience.
The proceeds gathered on the

festival's whirlwind tour benefit
the host organizations' respective
local communities.
"About 50 percent of the tour
screenings benefit an outdoor
program, community cause, or a
nonprofit organization. Some of
the causes supported by the tour
are bursaries for outdoor pursuits,
adventure programs for disadvan-
taged children, search and rescue
operations, climbing clubs, youth
ski programs and trail mainte-
nance groups," Stewart wrote.
The Banff Mountain Film Fes-
tival will screen at the Michigan

Theater at 7 p.m. Doors will open
at least a half hour before the show
time to give attendees the chance
to interact with local outdoor and
environmental organizations, who
will have set up tables in the lobby.
"Our desired outcome (in Ann
Arbor) is to increase the awareness
of the outdoor/environmental/
active community," Stawski added.
"We hope to let people know about
Outdoor Adventures. ... We want
to celebrate our successes of this
past year, highlight great student
employees and, above all, have
fun."

Nude models at the University are paid $15 an hour.


GROOVE SPOON
From Page 3B
The Beatles' "Hey Jude" and
Gnarls Barkley's "Crazy."
The band writes original music
too, "generally by taking a little
nugget and trying to make a tune
out of it," Stratton said.
Groove Spoon has written six to
eight original songs, four of which
have been recorded in a student-
run sound booth on campus and
put online. Most of the songs have
been spontaneous, free-form and
highly based on feeling.
As lead vocalist, Stanley con-
tributes greatly to the songwriting
dynamic.
"'Twan will just come in with
whole tunes in his head, MJ style,"
Stratton enthused about Stanley's
musical resemblance to Michael
Jackson.
"MJ experience, right here,"
Stanley jokingly agreed.
Groove Spoon's original single
"I Love You" was based off an audi-
ence-influenced concert improvi-
sation. The song, like their music,
changes and evolves constantly as
the band gets new bursts of inspi-
ration.
Band members polished "I Love
You" at a recent rehearsal. After
practicing the punchy electric gui-
tar and soft keyboard, the entire
band jumped into an a capella
rendition of the chorus in order to
harmonize the vocals. The room
was buoyant with unity and exu-
berance.
The band's name is one feature
that has stuck through more than

two years and up to 30 revolv-
ing members. Groove Spoon was
originally called A New Univer-
sal Sound, which Stratton loved
but clubs hated, so he went on an
online name generator and found
the name Groove Spoon.
"I don't really like the name," he
added. "But that's what it is, and
it's grown on me."
Another constant - one looked
at with more enthusiasm - is the
band's home at the University.
Groove Spoon has pockets of fans
fromgroupsand programs inwhich
the members are active. It thrives
on the experimental environment

the student atmosphere generates.
"This vibe you could really only
find on a college campus," said gui-
tarist Justin Douglas, who gradu-
ated from LSA in December. "Just
a bunch of musicians who are
coming together without the pres-
sure to get gigs and make tons on
money."
But Stratton feels no trepida-
tion about advertising the band's
events, which was not always the
case for his previous bands.
"With other bands, I would feel
weird about promoting," he said.
"But this one, it's just like, 'Your
loss if you don't go."'

NUDE MODELS
From Page lB
"I have my own mental exercis-
es I go through, just sort of medi-
tating. Or, I think about music or
do whatever schoolwork I can do
inside my head," he said.
At this point, he's so comfort-
able modeling that, while holding
a pose, he's capable of thinking
through a lot of his homework
and then just writing down those
thoughts once he returns home.
Cirocco, on the other hand,
takes an approach less steeped in
reality, often role-playing charac-
ters as she poses for a class.
"Most of the time I direct my
own poses, and I try to really tell
a story with them," she said. "I try
to think of a person who might be
doing this pose. Like, where are
they? Who are they? Where are
they going? And I try to create a
persona.
"I don't know if that comes
across for the artists in the class,"
she conceded.
In Cirocco's estimation, the
role-playing method not only
serves to keep her occupied, but
also acts to the benefit of stu-
dents because it lets her find more
authentic human body positions.
While she models though, she's
dedicated to remaining aware of
her situation, because she appre-
ciates the novelty of the opportu-
nity. In her eyes, modeling lets her
"walk the line between fantasy
and reality."
For other models, the mid-ses-
sion mental aerobics tend toward
banal survivalism. Jenny Cun-
ningham, a recent University
graduate, spends her time posing
thinking through grocery lists,
reflecting on her other part-time
jobs and coming up with ways to
make rent.
"It still gets boring," she said,
despite her best efforts to make
the experience stimulating.
In addition to takingvery ambi-
tious steps to pass the time (like
playing entire symphonies in his
eady to

head), Steve Cunningham relies
on a rather simple routine, lis-
tening in on professors as they
provide input and instructions to
students. A little coffee doesn't
hurt, either.
It "raises the threshold," as he
put it.
Still, even coffee can't lift the
brain beyond the deceptively
strong pull of boredom, and Steve
Cunningham and a few of his fel-
low figure models openly admit to
drifting into the occasional inad-
vertent nap, especially when they
are in reclining poses.
Most poses, however, do not
allow the figure models the plea-
sure of kicking back in a reclining
position. Instead, they often take
positions which become surprising-
ly strenuous, especially when the
model holds them for a particularly
long amount of time. The models
are given a few five-minute breaks
every session, but, in the end, the
physical exhaustion of modeling
rivals the mental exhaustion.
In the most extreme cases,
exhausted models have been known
to faint on their feet and slump to
the ground. Cirocco, who nearly
lost consciousness while holding a
standing pose inone of her first ses-
sions for a sculpture class, recalled
one story told to her by a professor.
"He told me about one time when
a model passed out, she fell off the
pedestal and he had to catch her,"
she said.
Shockingly, none of the students
in that particular class even rose to
help the professor shoulder the bur-
den of their fallen model, ostensibly
because they were so ingrained in
their work that they had begun to
perceive of the model as an infal-
lible object.
Of course, the models are never
perfect in their posing, even if
their injuries and mishaps don't
require heroic professor interven-
tion. Most of the time, they simply
get tired and sore.
"Ilearned pretty early on: Find-
ing a pose right away that I know
I can hold is pretty important,"
Merkin notes, acknowledging
how painful and unsustainable
certain poses can become.
"At the end of the semester
there were parts of my body that
just kind of hurt, chronically,"
he recounted, talking about a
sculpture course for which he
had to hold the same pose for the
entirety of every class for a whole
semester.
While Steve Cunningham
prides himself on being able to
endure physically demanding
poses, most of the models seem
to regard the numb toes and sore
knees inherent in the work more
as nuisances than badges of pride.
It's natural to assume that
the greatest impediment facing
any nude model would be sheer
nerves, but after talking to them,
it's no surprise that most of them
claim to have gotten over their
inhibitions in the first few min-
utes of a session and never looked
back. Indeed, by allowing them-
selves to appreciate the artistic
process they are making possi-
ble, or by temporarily perceiving

themselves as merely a collection
of lines and shapes, the models
can approach their work high on
satisfaction and low on reserva-
tions.
Impressively, the models all
seem as cognizant of the impor-
tance of nude models as the pro-
fessors and students do.
"It's never about me as a naked
person. It's about the body in its
natural state, and it just happens
to be my body that day," Jenny
Cunningham explained."It's real-
ly professional."
"I understand the importance
of having live bodies to work off
of. It's totally different if they're
wearing a leotard, or if it's a sculp-
ture that's already there. You real-
ly need an individual's body so you
can study how the muscles react
when you shift weight, and how
somebody's bones look and where
everything's situated."
Amanda Olson, an Art & Design
senior who has studied nude
models in figure drawing classes,
agrees that studying nude mod-
els, as opposed to clothed models
or objects, is essential to "under-
standing the form of the human
body."
Jeremy Daly, also an Art &
Design senior, put it similarly:
"There's nothing like drawing
from life."
In a form he hands out to stu-
dents at the onset of drawing
classes studying nude figures, Art
& Design and Residential College
professor Larry Cressman offers
his feelings on the importance of
nude models.
"Drawing from the nude model
is considered an essential part of
artistic training. It refers to the
larger experiences of life, with all
its shifting meanings and nuanc-
es."
He also shows a deep apprecia-
tion for the figure models making
the art possible.
"For the model it is hard work.
We treat themwithgreatrespect."
Given the propensity of part-
time work to crush enthusiasm
through monotony, it's encour-
aging to see how seriously most
models take their work - Jenny
Cunningham quickly recount-
ed how immensely guilty she
felt after accidentally sleeping
through a scheduled modeling
session. Not to mention how much
most of them enjoyit - Steve Cun-
ningham said that, even if model-
ing didn't pay, he'd pursue it as a
part-time hobby.
Because of the professionalism
and commitment of the models,
and the context in which they're
working, there's simply nothing
weird about nude modeling for
the parties involved. The study
of nude figures is a time-hon-
ored educational technique that
endures for good reason: The stu-
dents, professors and models all
find it~constructive.
Fortunately, university educa-
tion can provide a learning envi-
ronment free of taboos, and in
Jenny Cunningham's opinion,
nudity is no exception.
"It's totally normal here in the
art school:"
