Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 
discussed education, jobs, health 
care and roads at her second 
State of the State address on 
Wednesday evening at the State 
Capitol in Lansing. This was her 
second state address since her 
swearing-in as the 49th Governor 

of Michigan in January 2019.
In her 2019 address, Whitmer 
discussed key issues including 
Michigan’s infrastructure and 
educational system, emphasizing 
her 
intention 
to 
garner 
bipartisan support to address 
these problems. On Wednesday, 
Whitmer revisited her solution 
for Michigan’s infrastructure, 
which she claims would have 

fixed the roads by 2030 if it had 
been accepted by the Michigan 
legislature. 
“I am not giving up because 
the problem remains. In fact, it 
is worse because another year 
has passed. Cracked windshields, 
blown 
tires, 
busted 
rims,” 
Whitmer said. “That’s money 
that could go into your childcare 
budget, or your retirement fund 

or rent. And it’s also bad for 
business. We can’t ask businesses 
to invest in Michigan if we refuse 
to invest in ourselves.” 
With a lack of bipartisan 
cooperation 
for 
her 
initial 
proposal and a disappointing 
gridlock, according to Whitmer, 
she vowed to pursue executive 
action with her “Plan B.” 

The College of Literature, 
Science and the Arts Building and 
the Michigan Union both opened 
their doors to students and faculty 
on South State Street earlier this 
month, providing new study and 
meeting spaces. The reopened 
buildings provide more room for 
students as well as several cafes, 
study rooms and meeting spots.
Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
freshman Kiran Mangrulkar said 
it was easy to come to the Union 
because he lives in West Quad. 
Mangrulkar said the Union was 
a better study space than the 
Shapiro Undergraduate Library 
and Hatcher Graduate Library, 
where he has studied in the past. 
“I come here somewhat often,” 
Mangrulkar said. “I like the new 
spaces. I wish there (were) more 
outlets… I think they’re just very 
common, normal in general, 

nothing 
crazy, 
but 
nothing 
awful.” 
LSA junior Aparna Iyer said 
she 
appreciates 
the 
Union’s 
additional collaborative spaces. 
“I really like the student org 
spaces,” Iyer said. “The Idea Hub 
on the second floor, and I like 
that they put a ceiling over that 
courtyard, because that was just 
an unused wasted space, and I’m 
glad that we’re able to make use 
of that.”
LSA freshman Alex Majie said 
he likes the Union’s older design 
and anticipates studying there in 
the future. 
“I haven’t necessarily studied 
here yet,” Majie said. “But as I’m 
looking around, like, it would be 
a nice place to study. It’s not as 
quiet as a library, which is good in 
some aspects.”
Iyer said she thinks the Union 
has opened up space in other 
frequented study spaces.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

As attendees walked into 
the Emerging Drinking Water 
Contaminants Panel at Ford 
School of Public Policy on 
Wednesday afternoon, they 
were greeted with pizza, 
salad and voter registration 
forms. 
Panelist 
James 
Clift, 
deputy 
director 
at 
the 
Department of Environment, 
Great 
Lakes 
and 
Energy 
(EGLE), explained the role of 
the word “emerging” in the 
name of the event. 

“Contaminants have been 
around for a long time,” Clift 
said. “It’s usually an emerging 
understanding of what this 
contaminant means to us as 
humans.”
One 
of 
the 
types 
of 
chemicals 
currently 
under 
the 
public 
eye 
is 
perfluorooctanoic 
acid 
(PFAS), which is a group of 
manufactured 
chemicals 
that have been found in 
water. According to panelist 
John Meeker, professor and 
associate dean for research in 
the School of Public Health, 
it has been found to have 

negative effects on immunity, 
thyroid, liver, cholesterol and 
fetal development. 
Several of the panelists said 
Michigan’s government was 
ahead of the curve on PFAS 
and other water regulation 
policies compared to other 
state governments. They also 
mentioned the implications 
of the federal government’s 
inactivity regarding updating 
water care policy. 
Sara Hughes, an assistant 
professor 
at 
the 
School 
for 
Environment 
and 
Sustainability (SEAS), was 
one of the panelists. Her 

research 
focuses 
on 
the 
political 
and 
institutional 
dimensions 
of 
water 
and 
climate 
change 
policies, 
specifically 
in 
an 
urban 
context. 
“It is really exciting that 
the state of Michigan is 
acting ahead of the federal 
government and ahead of most 
other 
state 
governments,” 
Hughes said. “It’s a pretty 
exciting thing, and fun to 
watch, but we don’t want to 
give up on federal action by 
the EPA.”

teenagers 
post racist 
comments

Saline High School staff 
and administration were made 
aware on Monday of racist 
comments posted on social 
media by students. 
MLive obtained messages 
posted in a group chat on 
Snapchat created by Saline 
High School football players. 
In a chat titled “Racist,” 
followed by two gorilla emojis, 
one 
student 
introduced 
another to a chat with a 
message saying “My ni****,” 
while 
another 
responded 
by saying “Sup n****.” More 
messages 
were 
posted 
afterward by the same two 
students including “WHITE 
POWER” and “THE SOUTH 
WILL RISE AGAIN.” 
The 
chat 
included 
four 
students 
of 
color. 
After 
students sent the slurs and 
racist messages, some other 
students left the chat. 
In 
an 
interview 
with 
The

Scot 
Graden, 
superintendent of the Saline 
School 
District, 
said 
the 
school 
has

policy, 
including 
initial discipline, restorative 
justice and education.

The Osher Lifelong Learning 
Institute hosted a talk by 
Professor 
Jeffrey 
Bernstein 
titled “The 2020 Democratic 
Nomination: 
Who 
Gets 
to 
Choose, the Parties or the 
Voters?” on Wednesday at the 
Kellogg Eye Center auditorium. 
The event was attended by 
more than 100 members of 
the University of Michigan 
community. 
Bernstein 
is 
an 
award-
winning professor of political 
science at Eastern Michigan 
University. The talk focused on 
the evolution of the nomination 

process, the transfer of power 
from the parties to voters over 
time and the implications of 
this transfer. 
Bernstein 
began 
by 
explaining 
the 
importance 
of such talks in the current 
political climate. 
“I think we’re living in a time 
right now where neutrality 
and sitting on the sidelines 
and looking at politics and 
saying, 
‘Someone 
else 
can 
handle it: that’s not my thing,’ 
I don’t think we’re there right 
now,” Bernstein said. “These 
are highly charged and very 
interesting 
political 
times, 
and I’m glad to have the 
opportunity to be here and talk 
a little bit about what’s going 

on and a little bit about what’s 
happening in the world.”
Bernstein 
elaborated 
on 
the basic differences in the 
rule-setting 
procedures 
for 
nominations 
between 
the 
Republican 
and 
Democratic 
Parties, 
highlighting 
the 
relatively dynamic nature of 
the 
Democratic 
nomination 
process. 
“The 
Republican 
Party 
has a rule: that nomination 
procedures 
for 
the 
next 
election 
get 
dealt 
with 
at 
the 
Convention,” 
Bernstein 
said. 
“The 
Democrats 
are 
able to change the rules and 
continually evolve the rules. 
That creates a problem — it 
creates a challenge, a moving 

target really, for figuring out 
what the Democrats are doing 
and who stands to gain or to 
lose from it.”
One of the aims of the event 
was to inform the audience 
about the way the Democratic 
nomination process has evolved 
over time. Bernstein explained 
the transfer of power from the 
delegates at the Democratic 
National Convention to the 
voters 
by 
referencing 
the 
events of the 1968 Democratic 
Convention, when Sen. Eugene 
McCarthy, D-Minn., challenged 
incumbent President Lyndon B. 
Johnson. 

The 
restorative 
justice 
component 
typically 
entails 
either group or peer-to-peer 
meetings between perpetrator 
and victim but will be crafted 
on the comfort level of the 
victims. Graden stressed the 
importance of the educational 
component 
to 
ensure 
the 
impact of the racial slur used in 
the text is fully understood and 
never used again in the District. 
“Understanding 
the 
implications 
of 
that 
term, 
understanding the historical 
context of how that word has 
been used over time is incredibly 
important for us to make sure 
the students understand and 
internalize,” Graden said. “I 
think it’s important for us to be 
able to learn about the history 

of that word, and they may 
have lacked awareness prior 
to this week, but there should 
be no scenario where they lack 
awareness following our steps 
to educate them as to what and 
why that word should never be 
used.” 
At a Tuesday night school 
board meeting, MLive reported 
that Karamba Kaba, a Black 
Saline High School student who 
was added to the group chat, 
expressed feeling frustrated 
and unsafe after the incident. 
“I honestly hope you can 
do 
something 
to 
make 
us 
feel comfortable walking the 
hallways of that school,” Kaba 
said. “I feel like everybody is 
looking at me the wrong way.”
Graden said the District is 
taking efforts to make students 
of color feel safe in the school 
district by explicitly calling 
out the language as racist 

and 
integrating 
educational 
opportunities 
inside 
and 
outside the classroom. 
The 
Saline 
High 
School 
student body is nearly 90 
percent white, while only 3 
percent of students are Black. 
LSA senior Kevin Schnitzer 
graduated from Saline three 
years ago, and his younger 
brother is a current student 
at the high school. Schnitzer 
said he remembers multiple 
incidents when Saline students 
made racist comments, and 
said all were internally handled 
by the District. According to 
Schnitzer, the lack of diversity 
in Saline as a city and school 
district could exacerbate this 
problem.
“I don’t know how much 
the school board talks about 
it or anything, but a lot of 
people say it’s a super white 
school, and I mean, it’s kind 

of true,” Schnitzer said. “The 
vast majority of students there 
are white, that’s just Saline 
residents. A lot more of them 
are white than anything else 
In a letter sent to school 
district community members, 
Graden said Saline High School 
administrators 
conducted 
an investigation and found 
the incident to be an “act of 
racism” that caused harm to all 
of the District’s students, but 
especially students of color. 
“Our School and our District 
find the words used in these 
posts to be deplorable and we 
strongly denounce the actions 
and words of these students,” 
the letter read. “This is an 
opportunity for us — the staff, 
students, and community of 
Saline Area Schools — to stand 
for anti-racism, respect, and 
inclusion of all students.”

In 2013, Facebook paired 
with internet providers in 
the Philippines and allowed 
citizens to access Facebook 
for free. Alba said about 
two-thirds of citizens have 
internet access, and 99% 
of users have a Facebook 
account. But during the 2016 
presidential election in the 
Philippines, Alba began to 
notice a change in the way 
people in her home country 
used Facebook. 
“It started to shift when 
the presidential election in 
the Philippines was getting 
underway, from just like 
cute cat videos, to this really 
extreme 
rhetoric 
backing 
certain candidates that had 
really aggressive platforms 
like Duterte, who had a law 
and order platform that he 
used to promote what he 
said was the way to solve the 
country’s problems, which 
were a war on drugs,” Alba 
said.
The Duterte campaign used 
social 
media 
influencers, 
blatant 
disinformation 
campaigns and general fear 
regarding 
drugs 
to 
gain 
support across the country, 
Alba said. After Duterte was 
elected, he continued with 
the disinformation campaign 
to fuel his war on drugs, 
which Alba described as a 
human rights violation. Alba 
said each of these issues 
was a focus point for her 
journalistic work.
“When I was conceiving of 
this story, I wanted the drug 
war to be part of the story 
because I wanted to connect 
the 
human 
consequences 
of Facebook’s platform to 
the drug war, and just show 
that it’s not just algorithms 

operating in the void and 
changing people’s opinions, 
but the cost of disinformation 
is 
sometimes 
an 
actual 
human death toll,” Alba said.
The larger consequences 
of this issue struck Alba, who 
emphasized the fact that 
the dominance of certain 
social media platforms and 
new 
sources 
could 
limit 
what information people are 
exposed to. 
“Facebook is all about the 
world (media) domination,” 
Alba said. “They obviously 
started in the U.S., but really, 
really quickly their ambitions 
grew 
to 
an 
international 
scale, and the Philippines, 
this country that was very 
ripe to be a testing ground 
for what a Facebook country 
could look like.”
A similar disinformation 
campaign to the one that 
occurred in the Philippines 
in 2016 happened in the 
U.S. just six months later, 
during the U.S. presidential 
election. However, according 
to panelist Ceren Budak, a 
researcher who studies the 
diffusion of information on 
social media, the situation 
in the U.S. was different 
from the Philippines. Most 
private citizens in the U.S. 
have wide internet access, 
and much of the population 
still got their news from 
the 
mainstream 
media, 
rather 
than 
from 
social 
media. However, as Budak 
pointed out, Americans have 
different 
laws 
regarding 
how candidates can contact 
citizens on social media. 
“That’s one of the things 
that we care about in the 
U.S., is the personalization 
of information where the 
political elite can reach out 
to particular people and give 
them a very narrow message, 
and there is no accountability 
for that,” Budak said.

Budak 
explained 
how 
users get their information 
on social media and said the 
algorithms tend to expose 
users to what they already 
want to hear. 
Calling social media an 
“echo chamber,” Budak said 
it’s 
important 
for 
people 
to 
expose 
themselves 
to 
different 
sources 
of 
information. 
She 
stressed 
that people have to carefully 
choose what news they pay 
attention to. 
“From 
research, 
once 
something is out there it is 
really hard to stop,” Budak 
said, “So it is important to 
be able to stop sharing, don’t 

do it right away, just give 
yourself a couple of minutes 
before you share something.”
Alba 
and 
Budak 
both 
agreed the issue of social 
media disinformation is not 
an easy one to solve. Because 
the problem is both social 
and technological, multiple 
steps are required to fix 
the issue. According to the 
panelists, however, solutions 
include creating proactive 
policy, getting individuals 
to 
purposefully 
expose 
themselves 
to 
different 
ideas, 
targeting 
domestic 
disinformation 
creators 
and cutting off the revenue 
sources to the people who 

spread disinformation.
The issue of disinformation 
has played a role in several 
contemporary 
political 
issues. According to LSA 
junior Jackson Hawkins, the 
events in the Philippines 
have worldwide relevance.
“I 
thought 
this 
was 
really 
interesting 
because 
even 
though 
this 
was 
about the Philippines the 
same thing happens in the 
U.S.,” 
Hawkins 
said. 
“I 
really liked the solutions 
that they offered, such as 
disincentivizing advertising 
and disinformation.”
Alba concluded the event 
with thoughts on her home 

country 
and 
how 
social 
media 
disinformation 
has 
continued to be an ongoing 
problem across the world. 
“With this stuff happening 
before the U.S. election and 
the same stuff happening 
during the U.S. election, it 
felt like the platforms being 
American-centric companies 
instigated 
the 
move 
to 
scrutinize these platforms 
and 
the 
power 
of 
these 
platforms,” 
Alba 
said. 
“I 
really wish this didn’t have to 
go that far and that they had 
looked at it even when it was 
going on in the Philippines.”

In 
relation 
to 
federal 
inactivity, Meeker explained 
the risk assessment process 
and how it relates to water 
contamination 
research. 
The process involves three 
steps: 
hazard 
identification, 
dose-response and exposure 
assessment. 
He 
particularly 
criticized how the United States 
addresses hazard identification, 
treating chemicals as “innocent 
until proven guilty.” 
Charlotte Jameson, program 
director 
of 
Energy 
and 
Drinking Water Policy and 
Legislative Affairs for Michigan 
Environmental 
Council, 
described the passive way the 
nation deals with hazardous 
chemicals, noting the difficulty 
of having such a large number 
of 
potentially 
dangerous 
chemicals in existence.
“In the U.S., we do not 
follow precautionary principles 
when it comes to chemicals of 
concern,” Jameson said. “You 
and I, we’re all guinea pigs for 
toxic chemicals, and there are 
thousands of them that are 
in commercial products right 
now that we don’t have sound 
information on.”

and 
Sustainability graduate student 
Colin Welk is currently taking 
EAS 558: Water Policy and 
Politics, a class taught by 
Hughes. 
“It 
seems 
like 
this 
is 

definitely the next area in 
water policy,” Welk said. “I’m 
interested to learn more about 
contaminants and how they’re 
regulated.”
According to panelist Eric 
Oswald, director of the Drinking 
Water 
and 
Environmental 
Health 
Division 
of 
the 
Michigan EGLE Department, 
Ann Arbor has a well-funded 
and 
well-managed 
drinking 
water system. However, most 
other systems in the state don’t 
have the funds to follow in Ann 
Arbor’s footsteps, and even with 
the changes made, Ann Arbor is 
still far from contaminant-free. 
The event ended with a Q&A 
session 
with 
the 
panelists. 
Attendees 
asked 
about 
the 
quantitative 
measures 
of 
sources 
of 
contaminants, 
the feasibility of other cities 
making the changes Ann Arbor 
has and which contaminants 
citizens should be focused on. 
The 
final 
question 
inquired which other states, 
municipalities 
or 
utility 
districts the panelists thought 
were 
leading 
the 
change. 
According to the panelists, on 
the state level, it was Michigan.
In 
the 
closing 
remarks, 
Public Policy graduate student 
James 
VanSteel, 
acting 
president of the Environmental 
Policy 
Association 
and 
mediator for this event, and the 
panelists encouraged citizens 
to leave public comments on 
the Michigan Environmental 
Council website.

“Tomorrow I will ask the State 
Transportation Commission to 
issue state road bonds so we can 
start fixing the roads,” Whitmer 
said. “Since it does not require 
the legislature to act, we can 
get started right away. That’s 
important.”
Whitmer 
reflected 
on 
progress 
made 
in 
2019, 
mentioning 
bipartisan 
legislation that decreased the 
cost of car insurance after six 
years of Michigan having the 
highest auto insurance rates in 
the nation. She also highlighted 
collaboration with Secretary of 
State Jocelyn Benson to launch 
redistricting efforts, criminal 
justice reform and the creation 
of the environmental justice 
advisory council. 
Whitmer 
detailed 
these 
accomplishments 
and 
tied 
them back to the importance of 
upholding Michigan’s diversity 
of 
thought, 
despite 
tension 
between 
political 
parties 
stemming from the national 
level. 
“These 
firsts 
honor 
the 
beautiful 
diversity 
that 
is 
Michigan,” 
Whitmer 
said. 
“Unfortunately, we’ve also seen 
an uptick in hateful, harmful 
language 
in 
Michigan 
and 
across the country. A lot of it 
starts in Washington, D.C., and 
now it feels like it can work its 
way to Lansing. Whether it’s 
misogyny in the workplace, or 
threats of violence online, this is 
unacceptable. Let’s debate. Let’s 
disagree. But then, let everyone 
in this room live up to our 
responsibility to stand up to hate 
and 
harassment. 
Remember 
that our children are watching. 
In Michigan, diversity is our 
strength.” 
Whitmer then moved to her 
next point of discussion — jobs. 
Though Michigan has boasted 
10 years of economic growth, 
Whitmer 
said 
underskilled 
and 
overtime 
workers 
are 
still struggling to get ahead. 
Presenting her policies as part 
of the solution, she highlighted 
investment in the auto industry 
and 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Canadian 
government 
to 
construct the Gordie Howe 
International Bridge, a project 
which is projected to bring in 
thousands of jobs. 
Alongside the creation of new 
jobs, Whitmer emphasized job 
security and worker rights as 
integral to creating a healthy 

workforce. To solve this, she has 
worked with the Department 
of 
Labor 
and 
Economic 
Opportunity to expand the right 
to overtime pay and cracked 
down on company regulation to 
pay employees. 
“We should be able to take 
time off when our kids are born 
and afford childcare when we 
are ready to go back to work. We 
need employers who invest in 
a strong workforce,” Whitmer 
said. “When I was growing up if 
you worked more than 40 hours 
a week you were paid over. It 
was that simple. It should still be 
that simple.” 
Whitmer then transitioned 
to the topic of education. She 
mentioned Michigan’s ranking 
at the bottom 10 states for overall 
literacy, and highlighted efforts 
to make pre-K universal for 
districts where test scores are 
low and providing better access 
to childcare. Expanding on 
this, she advocated for literacy 
coaches 
and 
organization 
partnerships in communities to 
help families navigate reading 
laws enacted by her predecessor 
Gov. Rick Snyder, and continue 
support through middle and 
high school by equitably funding 
schools.
“We can get ahead of this 
problem if we start early, but 
our work cannot stop with early 
literacy,” Whitmer said. “All 
Michigan students should have 
the opportunity to go to properly 
funded schools. The one-size-
fits-all approach does not work. 
Any teacher can tell you that 
every student has potential, 
but their needs are often very 
different. This year, together, we 
move forward with an equitable 
funding formula.”
Whitmer’s final topic of the 
evening centered on affordable 
health care. She said while 
Michigan expanded Medicaid 
to cover more than 600,000 
Michiganders in 2014, many 
residents 
still 
lack 
access 
because of a lack of insurance. 
She emphasized the importance 
of the Affordable Care Act to 
protect 
Michigan 
residents, 
highlighting 
an 
effort 
to 
eliminate disparities in the care 
of people of color, extending 
mental 
health 
services 
and 
addressing the opioid crisis. 
“So here is the bottom line: 
the health of our state is only 
as good as the health of our 
residents,” Whitmer said. “I 
want to end where I began. 
Impatience is a virtue. Sure, it’s 
good to be patient when you’re 
waiting in the line of the grocery 

store, or when you are a Lions 
fan. But not now. Not when 
people’s lives and livelihoods are 
at stake.”
In addition to these main 
topics, Whitmer promised a 
Thursday follow-up on topics of 
climate change and protection of 
Michigan’s water in the coming 
weeks, addressing the issue 
of PFAS and rising lake levels’ 
impact on tourism, agriculture 
and infrastructure. 
State 
Rep. 
Yousef 
Rabhi, 
D-Ann Arbor, echoed the policy 
points in Whitmer’s address and 
the importance of her specific 
focus on the lives of working-
class Michiganders, whether 
that be through the scope of job 
security, health care or roads. 
According to Rabhi, it was a 
notable shift in topics from 
those addressed during Snyder’s 
administration. 
“She highlighted a bunch of the 
stuff that her administration is 
working on, but what I also liked 
is that she highlighted specific 
things that she is working with 
the House Democratic caucus on 
as well, that there are really cool 
initiatives that we’re all working 
together on to actually help 
move our state forward,” Rabhi 
said. “Policies that are very 
focused on everyday working 
Michiganders and fighting for 
working-class people, that is 
exactly the kind of stuff that I 
was hoping she’d talk about, and 
I’m really glad she touched on 
those things because we didn’t 
hear that for the last eight years 
from our Republican governor.”
Rabhi 
further 
commented 
on 
the 
division 
between 
Republicans and Democrats in 
Lansing, despite his belief that 
these should be universally 
supported issues. 
“There was a very sharp 
division on the floor in terms of 
when she talked about that kind 
of stuff,” Rabhi said. “And many 
of the points that she made, we 
stood up, the Democrats stood 
up and said, ‘Yes, we support 
workers’ rights, we support 
what you’re saying about that.’ 
And the Republicans just didn’t. 
And 
it 
wasn’t 
controversial 
issues, we’re just trying to 
fight for everyday working-
class Michiganders and make 
sure that people aren’t getting 
defrauded 
by 
employers, 
and that’s not something the 
Republicans can even stand up 
and support.”
Rabhi echoed the importance 
of the topics discussed and 
emphasized the need for further 
discussion regarding clean water 

contamination as a problem that 
is plaguing Michigan’s most 
valuable resource in all corners 
of the state. He mentioned his 
role in prioritizing clean water 
on the administration’s agenda, 
and noted green ooze that was 
discovered along a highway in 
southeast Michigan.
“Obviously with this green 
ooze in Oakland County, what 
I like to say, and what I think 
is true, is that every single state 
house district has a version of the 
green ooze,” Rabhi said. “In Ann 
Arbor, it’s PFAS, it’s dioxane, 
and we all have a massive 
contamination problem in our 
state, which is why we need laws 
like the one I introduced last 
year to make polluters pay to 
clean up their messes. And that’s 
a conversation that we need to 
continue to have, and highlight 
in the state because we also 
deserve to have clean water.”
The 
Republican 
response 
to 
Whitmer’s 
address, 
however, was far more critical. 
Laura Cox, chairman of the 
Michigan 
Republican 
Party, 
said 
Whitmer’s 
message 
of 
bipartisanship was far from 
the reality of her past year as 
governor.
“Tonight’s 
address 
is 
yet 
another reminder of Gretchen 
Whitmer’s failed first year as 
governor, and even more of 
the same empty promises for 
the future,” Cox said. “Instead 
of committing to work with 
Republicans to find common 
sense solutions to Michigan’s 
problems, Governor Whitmer 
made it clear that she’ll go it 
alone without the legislature if 
they don’t agree with her tax and 
spend policies. From her support 
for impeachment and Medicare-
for-all, and her unrealistic road 
proposal that raises taxes on 
hardworking Michiganders — 
Whitmer has proved that she 
is no different than the same 
out-of-touch liberal Democrats 
determined to sabotage the 
American dream.”
Next week, Whitmer will be 
one of two Democrats, alongside 
Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, 
who will deliver the Democratic 
rebuttal to President Trump’s 
State of the Union address. 
Her selection to deliver the 
rebuttal follows Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi’s praising of Whitmer’s 
progressive 
policies 
in 
Michigan, and national attention 
as a possible running mate to 
the 
Democratic 
presidential 
nominee.

“I’ve noticed that this place 
(the Union) fills up so I’m 
assuming that like Ross, the 
UGLi and Hatcher, they must be 
less full,” Iyer said. 
LSA junior Conor Duggan 
studied in the LSA Building for 
the first time Wednesday night. 
Duggan, who normally studies 
in the Hatcher Graduate Library, 
the UGLi and the Fishbowl 
in Mason Hall, said he hasn’t 
noticed a particular difference 
in the number of people studying 
there.
“I’ve only studied at the UGLi 
three times this semester so 
far, which sounds bad, but it is 
still early,” Duggan said. “I had 
no problem getting a seat, but 
it’s still early, so I mean, exams 
haven’t happened yet, you know, 
people aren’t feeling that rush 

yet. So it’s kind of too early to tell 
whether or not the space is really 
opened up.” 
Majie 
also 
noticed 
the 
Union was busy and said there 
were fewer students at more 
traditional study spaces.
“I’ve definitely noticed less 
people at the libraries since 
these two places have opened, 
which is nice in a way, you know, 
everybody’s like branching out, 
finding new places to study,” 
Majie said.
Duggan 
said 
students 
shouldn’t have trouble finding a 
place to work on campus.
“I think there’s a lot of 
resources on campus, like even 
you could go to like East Hall, 
the Law Library, the Graduate 
Library, the UGLi,” Duggan said. 
“I feel like sometimes it stinks 
that you have to walk around a 
little bit to find a place, but I mean 
after that you can always find a 
place if you actually look for it.”

Appreciate the love! Sincerely, Asians

I 

love 
watching 
movies 
but never paid too much 
attention to award shows. 
I knew the names of some of the 
biggest film celebrations, like the 
Academy Awards and the Golden 
Globes, but that was the extent 
of my knowledge. I would scroll 
through my Instagram feed and 
maybe see a couple posts about 
which film won Best Picture, but 
that was about it. This all changed 
when “Parasite” came out.
The movie came out this past 
summer while I was in Korea 
and I had the opportunity to 
see it in theaters. The movie is 
directed by Bong Joon-ho, one of 
South Korea’s most famous and 
critically 
acclaimed 
directors, 
and stars Song Kang-ho, a top 
South Korean actor. Because of 
the film’s star power, everyone 
had high expectations for it. I left 
the theater in awe of how good 
it was. This well-made thriller 
about coexistence, centering on 
an impoverished Korean family 
that begins to work for a wealthy 
one, satires our modern-day class 
system. As much as I would love to 
talk about the plot, I will not spoil 
the movie for those who have not 
seen it yet.
Currently, 
“Parasite” 
is 
collecting many of the most 
prestigious 
cinematic 
awards 
worldwide. It won the Palme 
d’Or — the highest prize awarded 
at the Cannes Film Festival — as 
well as some Golden Globes and 
Screen Actors Guild awards. As a 
Korean, I am immensely proud to 
see a Korean film enjoy such an 
unprecedented amount of success. 
But what feels better is the sense of 
acceptance and validation finally 
being awarded to Asians in media.
For her role in 2019’s “The 
Farewell,” 
Awkwafina 
became 
the first Asian American to win 
Best Actress for a Musical or 
Comedy at the Golden Globes. 
Netflix apparently had to win a 
bidding war to secure Ali Wong as 
the hostess for stand-up comedy 

specials after the success of 
“Always Be My Maybe.” “Crazy 
Rich Asians,” the first major 
Hollywood studio film with a 
majority Asian cast in a modern 
setting since “The Joy Luck Club” 
in 1993, also enjoyed commercial 
and critical success. It became the 
highest-grossing romantic comedy 
film in nearly a decade. Disney’s 
live-action “Mulan” and Marvel’s 
first Asian hero film “Shang-Chi” 
will arrive in theaters soon. 
Before these recent successes, 
Asian 
representation 
in 
traditional media took a number 
of unfortunate turns. Only a 
handful of Asian roles existed 
before “Crazy Rich Asians,” and 
some of these roles were blatantly 
racist or heavily stereotypical. 
Mickey Rooney — who is white — 
played the role of a Japanese man 
named Mr. Yunioshi in “Breakfast 
at Tiffany’s.” Randall Park, who 
starred in “Always Be My Maybe” 
alongside Ali Wong, remarked to 
TIME magazine that he played 
doctors maybe a few too many 
times. Asian Americans make up 
about six percent of the entire 
population, yet only one percent 
of all leading roles in Hollywood 
were played by Asian Americans as 
of 2018. One study from professors 
at 
six 
California 
universities 
proved that only one-third of the 
242 scripted shows on broadcast, 
cable and streaming TV had an 
Asian Amerian or Pacific Islander 
character who was a series regular.
Media lives off of stereotypes 
and, to some extent, is responsible 
for 
furthering 
them. 
While 
stereotypes are not the most 
sincere form of judgment, I must 
admit they are based on some 
truth. Asian parents are widely 
recognized to be passionate about 
their children’s education and, 
not to much surprise, want their 
children to become doctors or 
lawyers. However, this does not 
mean that the media should exploit 
such stereotypes and further 
consolidate them.

I still remember one of my 
high school friends showing me 
a clip from “Family Guy” where 
an Asian dad, in his heavy Asian 
accent, scolds his son for not being 
a doctor at the age of 12. This was 
during my first year in America, 
and I instantly knew that was how 
we were portrayed. The stereotype 
and its presentation lingered on and 
was stuck in the back of my head. I 
unconsciously put myself under the 
stereotype and even wanted to live 
up to it. I never liked math or science, 
but felt like I had to ace those classes, 
and felt proud when a non-Asian 
peer of mine approached me to ask 
questions on those subjects.
Limited 
and 
stereotypical 
representation in the media certainly 
played a part in driving me toward 
the 
pre-established 
stereotypes. 
There were no cool Asian characters 
in any shows or movies. There was 
nobody for me to rely on.
Then, once again, “Parasite” 
came out and is now collecting 
numerous meaningful accolades. 
Asian Americans have only recently 
gained some momentum in media 
representation and I hope the film’s 
success can be the breakthrough. I 
hope the film, along with individuals 
like Ali Wong and Awkwafina, can 
bring some spotlight to Asians so 
that we can correctly represent 
ourselves. I do not expect all 
stereotypes to be wiped out, but I 
sincerely hope that these collective 
achievements can provide society 
with 
the 
more 
diverse 
and 
appropriate 
representation 
we 
deserve. I hope we can be better 
assimilated into society as who 
we are: wonderfully talented, 
culturally diverse and capable of 
many different things, just like 
everyone else. We are not just 
good at math or science; we are 
more than just doctors or lawyers. 
We can be award-winning movie 
directors, actors and actresses, 
comedians and even superheroes.

To use or refuse?
B

ack in September, a 
friend of mine admitted 
he was attracted to me. 
Not emotionally, he assured me, 
just physically. That seemed off 
— he’s usually into women, and 
he knows in no uncertain terms 
that I am not a woman — but I 
wasn’t going to let that ruin a 
four-year friendship. That took 
a few more months to ruin. 
The 
vulgar 
jokes 
didn’t 
bother me so much; those had 
always existed. It was the 
sudden commentary about all 
the sexual things he wanted 
to do with transgender guys, 
things he didn’t talk about 
before I was 18 and living an 
hour away. It was the sudden 
inquiry into the circumstances 
under which I would send 
“someone” nudes. It was the 
lamenting over my lack of 
confidence in my transgender 
body because it was “so hard” 
for him to listen to, as someone 
who appreciated that body in 
such a way. He said more than 
that, of course — nor was he 
the only one — but those words 
don’t belong in a newspaper.
We 
often 
hear 
of 
the 
transphobia 
and 
disgust 
directed toward trans people, 
but the opposite is often true 
as well: We are simultaneously 
fetishized 
by 
the 
same 
transphobia that deems us 
undesirable 
until 
rejection 
and exploitation are our only 
options.
When 
speaking 
of 
transgender 
exploitation, 
sex work comes to mind. 
Transgender 
porn 
(almost 
always of trans women) is 
undeniably popular, in some 
cases being the most popular 
genre for a given porn studio. 
This 
sexualization 
partly 
explains why so many trans 
people end up in sex trafficking, 
trading 
sexual 
favors, 
as 
victims of sexual assault or 
in prostitution. This works in 
tandem with the fact that we’re 
at high risk for homelessness, 
a fact uniformly addressed 
in these particular studies 
about trans sex work. Within 
the trans community, we use 
the term “chaser” to refer to 
someone who fetishizes and 
seeks out trans sex partners 
because of our transness, as it’s 
such a common experience.
The fetishization of trans 
people 
remains 
prevalent 
even 
in 
non-sexual 
media 
because porn was previously 
the only sphere in which the 
existence of trans people was 
acknowledged. The New York 
Times, for instance, reported 
on the death of a trans woman 
in a fire, noting that she was 
“curvaceous” and “was known 
to invite men for visits to her 
apartment” within the first 
line. The article was published 
in 2012 and was never edited 
to remove the unnecessary, 
sexually-charged commentary 
despite public backlash.
Mainstream 
media 
finds 
other ways to exploit us, too. 
Once trans people started to 
make themselves known to 

the public, news outlets leaped 
at the chance to cover the 
controversial matter of our 
existence. 
Caitlyn 
Jenner’s 
transition was one of the 
biggest news stories of 2015, 
to the point that she was given 
an 
eight-part 
documentary 
series, 
garnered 
a 
million 
Twitter followers in a matter 
of hours when she launched 
her profile and was considered 
for TIME’s Person of the 
Year. A transgender person’s 
transition, often a long-awaited 
and life-changing process, was 
broadcast nearly constantly for 
the world to see, knowing that 
many people would give her 
backlash for it. In a sense, her 
fame made this publicization 
inevitable, but to this extent? 
It is hard to call Jenner’s news 
coverage altruistic in nature

Even 
fictional 
media 
co-opts 
trans 
stories 
for 
the sake of drama. In some 
cases — 21 percent of cases 
according to the Gay and 
Lesbian 
Alliance 
Against 
Defamation — we’re made 
to 
be 
the 
villains, 
often 
portrayed as serial killers 
like in Sleepaway Camp and 
Silence of the Lambs. Other 
times, our existence is played 
for 
laughs. 
In 
“Friends,” 
Chandler’s 
“father” 
is 
supposedly 
a 
drag 
queen 
but is portrayed much more 
like a trans woman, and she 
apparently only exists to be 
misgendered and made fun of; 
“Family Guy” takes the same 
concept 
to 
another 
level, 
with other characters being 
downright 
disgusted 
and 
terrified, while demonizing 
the trans women in question 
as if this terror is funny 
rather than dangerously true 
to life.
Then, in most other cases, 
we 
are 
victimized: 
“The 
Crying Game” sees a trans 
woman beaten when a straight 
man takes her clothes off; and 
“Boys Don’t Cry,” one of the 
few mainstream portrayals 
of a transgender man, is 
about the murder of the trans 
protagonist. All these stories 
were written by cisgender 
writers, seizing experiences 
that are foreign to them for 
the sake of comedy or drama 
and condemning trans people 
in the process. If that wasn’t 
already exploitative enough, 
consider that none of these 
parts were played by trans 
people, or even by cis people 
of the correct gender — each 
of these roles is filled by a 
cis actor of the characters 

assigned gender at birth (that 
is to say, men playing trans 
women, and women playing 
trans men).
This sort of backhanded 
acknowledgment 
of 
our 
struggles showcases how we 
interact with all of society. 
Trans people are twice as 
likely as others to serve in 
the military (driven in no 
small part to disproportionate 
homelessness), 
yet 
we’re 
banned from serving at the 
behest 
of 
our 
commander 
in chief. I personally have 
denied recruiters several times 
with equal parts smugness 
and bitterness. The medical 
establishment 
we 
depend 
on to transition forces us 
to jump through hoops to 
get healthcare, such as a 
therapist’s approval letter to 
start hormone replacement or 
get surgery, while said therapy 
and procedures may or may 
not be covered by insurance 
(if we even have insurance). 
I received my approval letter 
for testosterone back in April, 
only to be denied care by every 
trans-serving practitioner in 
my county until other health 
issues 
inevitably 
demanded 
my attention. The legal system 
charges us to petition for name 
changes, update our passports 
and 
similar 
documentation 
and often mandates expensive 
and invasive “reassignment” 
surgeries before we can legally 
be recognized as the correct 
gender; thankfully, Michigan 
has recently eliminated the last 
issue, which otherwise would 
have prevented me and many 
others from legal transition 
indefinitely. Even within the 
LGBTQ+ 
community, 
trans 
people 
have 
historically 
spearheaded activist work only 
to face hate from transphobic 
members of the community.
Unfortunately, allies and even 
trans people themselves don’t 
always realize how exploitative 
these 
establishments 
can 
be, 
thinking 
that 
media 
representation 
and 
sexual 
appeal are inherently a net 
positive. The truth is that 
it’s the same transphobia as 
before rebranded to seem 
less malicious. The choice 
between 
exploitation 
and 
rejection is often life or 
death: For trans sex workers 
who can’t get wage work 
because employers can fire or 
deny them for being trans, for 
trans people who have to shell 
out thousands for surgeries 
they don’t need or want so 
that their driver’s license 
doesn’t out them and for trans 
youth who want to love and be 
loved without experiencing 
domestic violence, there is no 
real choice. As a trans college 
student 
choosing 
between 
sexual harassment from a 
“friend” and a nagging sense 
of unwantedness, I’m one 
of the few who could afford 
rejection over exploitation.

Appropriate cultural appropriation

G

rowing up, I learned in 
school that racism was an 
easy fix: Treat everyone 
equally and judge them by the 
content of their character, not 
the color of their skin. While that 
axiom and mindset come naturally 
to most, it works mainly as a “going 
forward” proposition. What about 
all of the damage done, particularly 
that of slavery? We need to be 
more than fair and open-minded 
going forward. We need to show 
deference to those who have been 
neglected. One solution to this 
difficult problem is to educate 
people about the further damage 
that cultural appropriation may 
cause – even though this still falls 
far short of any real repayment of 
a debt owed.
Dana Schutz’s painting “Open 
Casket,” a depiction of the exposed 
face of Emmett Till, a 14-year-
old Black teenager murdered in 
1955, at his funeral, was widely 
criticized at the time of its debut 
in 2017 – not for its content, but for 
its white creator. Although Schutz 
wasn’t making any money from 
the painting, it was still thought 
to exploit Black suffering “for fun” 
or artistic gain. The argument was 
that she couldn’t possibly relate to 
black mothers and shouldn’t claim 
she can. 
One of the first forms of 
cultural colonialism dates back 
to the 1900s. Blackface was an 
early technique used in minstrel 
shows 
to 
effectively 
weave 
whiteness into every part of 
society. Today, the entertainment 
industry is still making progress 
in becoming more inclusive of 
diverse cultures. New York Times 
article “Hollywood, Separate and 
Unequal” by Manohla Dargis 
and A. O. Scott outlines the 
development of Black roles from 
historically being “servers” of 
more white, dominant roles to 
recently gaining more prominence 
on screen. Movies need more 
Black actors, but directors need to 
be conscious that they’re casting 
them for the right reasons and not 
just for political clout.
Instances 
of 
white 
people 
rapping, kindergarteners wearing 
Native American costumes on 
Thanksgiving and Gordon Ramsay 
cooking Indian food are debated 
in the same breath as blackface 
and the misuse of “negro” music 
during the Harlem Renaissance 
period. But are they the same? Is 

the modern-day any less racist 
than it was 80 years ago?
The term cultural appropriation 
originally referred to a global 
ruling 
class 
dominating 
and 
taking advantage of a globally 
marginalized class. Today, it is a 
highly individualized concept that 
applies to any person who takes 
offense by a white person using 
their culture and its tortured past 
lightly as a costume or style. As a 
Mexican, society gives me the right 
to claim cultural appropriation on 
my friend who wears a sombrero 
on Cinco de Mayo, even though I’ve 
always considered it a lighthearted 
form of celebration. While some 
cultural antics are better left to 
those that created them, there’s a 
difference between a “colonizer in 
disguise” and a “sad try-hard.”
There are important discussions 
to be had about white supremacy 
and race struggles that still exist 
in America today. However, if 
we claim every instance of a pop 
star dressing the wrong way a 
grossly construed form of racism, 
we will be having “reductive 
conversation(s)” about whether 
the newest Zara skirt is offensively 
stealing the style of an Indian lungi 
or not, making little progress along 
the way. While I’m sure there’s 
someone out there who takes deep 
offense to the newest fashion trend, 
these conversations are limited 
and hold us back from focusing on 
the real racism in America — the 
one that offends not just a handful 
of individuals but a whole class of 
people. Excessive claims dilute the 
meaning of class appropriation 
and run the risk of sounding like a 
hammer that thinks everything’s a 
nail.
Millennials have developed a 
“cancel culture” whereby public 
figures quickly come under fire for 
culturally appropriated remarks 
or actions. This concept, however, 
has been used so sweepingly 
that deep divisions have formed 
between cultures, limiting unity 
and progress. Yes, affirmative 
action, other reparative measures 
and just the general goal of respect 
necessitates we recognize and 
appreciate 
different 
identities, 
but there’s also worth in coming 
together as one. Usually, when 
someone copies another person, 
it is a form of flattery. Influencers 
deem it cultural appropriation 
unless it’s done in a very specific, 
fine-toothed way. In the real world, 

that looks like buying Japanese-
inspired pillows from a Japanese 
market itself because buying it 
from Urban Outfitters would be 
inappropriate.
I’d argue everyone appropriates 
culture. Cook a Chinese meal 
lately without cultural consent? 
You appropriated. Use a singing 
technique that’s not from your 
own culture? A Canadian award-
nominee was bullied for that. 
Wear a qipao to prom and you’re 
not Chinese? That was the latest 
social media scandal. Ironically, 
people of color are “nearly as likely 
as whites to face accusations” 
of racial identity theft. Cultural 
exchange is natural and inherent 
to growth. 
There are certainly harmful 
instances of culture being placed 
flagrantly out of context. However, 
when 
done 
right, 
cultural 
exchange 
inspires 
creativity, 
encourages differentiation and 
even bonds people. I’d love to see 
Black and white rappers work 
together to produce the next 
greatest hit, instead of white 
rappers being shunned for not 
having the cultural angle to sound 
good.
Refusing 
to 
include 
other 
groups 
in 
the 
exchange 
of 
ideas 
and 
intellect 
seems 
discriminatory to me. People like 
to make the argument that cultural 
appropriation is about a power 
struggle. It’s fine for colonized 
groups to borrow from each other 
but wrong for white Americans to 
do so because of their history of 
exploitation. However, as David 
Frum at the Atlantic points out, 
cultural staples from these groups 
have also been founded on histories 
of empires that dominated and 
exploited other cultures: “The 
Han Chinese learned to drink tea 
… from peoples to their south.”
James Zwerg fought against 
racism as a Freedom Rider in the 
60s alongside John Lewis. He 
is a white man who expressed 
anger toward white supremacists 
and unapologetically voiced his 
support for Black citizens. Dana 
Schutz is an artist who used 
her talent to speak on the same 
issues. One is honored as a civil 
rights advocate and the other an 
offensive artist, but they might be 
more similar than one might think.

‘Do I think aliens are real? No.’

The Daily sits down Cam York and Johnny Beecher to talk about hot dogs, Deflategate and Area 51

The Daily hockey beat used 
to run a video series during the 
2011-12 season called “Quick 
Hits.” They were one-on-one 
interviews with players that 
covered everyday life and all 
of its funny moments. Now, it’s 
back in written format.
For the first edition of the 
semester, The Daily’s Molly 
Shea and Bailey Johnson sat 
down 
with 
freshmen 
Cam 
York and Johnny Beecher to 
discuss 
conspiracy 
theories, 
Deflategate and if a hot dog is a 
sandwich.
***
This 
transcript 
has 
been 
lightly edited for length and 
clarity.
Molly: 
Is 
a 
hot 
dog 
a 
sandwich?
Cam: No.
Johnny: I wouldn’t say it is, 
no.
Molly: Why not? It has meat 
and it has bread, and those are 
the two main components of a 
sandwich.
Cam: Yeah, but there’s not 
two pieces of it.
Johnny: Yeah that’s true, it’s 
only one piece of bread.
Molly: But isn’t a sub a 
sandwich? And that’s one piece 
of bread.
Johnny: A sub? Why would 
you call it a sub?
Associate 
head 
coach 
Bill 
Muckalt walked through the 
office.
Bill: Do you call it a grinder 
or a sub?
Johnny: I call it a sub. Would 
you say a hot dog’s a sandwich?
Bill: You know what, at 
Portillo’s it might be. I love 
Portillo’s. Have you been to 
Portillo’s?
Molly: The chocolate cake 
shake is so good!

Bill: Not only that, the Italian 
beef with the hot peppers. Ugh, 
it’s the best. I would call it a 
grinder, hero, it’s all subs.
Johnny: I wouldn’t call a hot 
dog a sandwich.
Cam: I wouldn’t either.
Bailey: If the team was 
stranded on a deserted island, 
who would survive?
Cam: I would 
say myself, to be 
honest.
Johnny: 
What? You’d be 
one of the first to 
go, man.
Bailey: 
Why 
do you think it’s 
you?
Cam: 
I’m 
a 
good fisherman, 
I know how to 
fish. I can catch fish.
Johnny: That is true, you 
could eat.
Cam rubs his hands together 
like he’s going to start a fire.
Cam: I know how to make a 
fire out of wood.
Johnny: That’s a blatant lie.
Cam: I’m not kidding.
Johnny: I don’t know, I’d 
probably say (senior goaltender 
Hayden) Lavigne. He would just 
be good at the weird stuff and 
he would be able to do that stuff 
and survive somehow.
Cam: Jeez, he has a family.
Molly: 
If 
you 
were 
a 
superhero, what would be your 
power and your name?
Cam: Probably to fly, and I 
would say Forny.
Johnny: I don’t know. I’d say 
super strength or something 
like that, I don’t know what my 
name would be. Beech?
Molly: Do you guys believe in 
aliens?
Johnny: I think they’re out 
there somewhere. I feel like 
there’s gotta be another life 
form somewhere else in the 
universe, I don’t know.
Cam: I don’t know. We 
would’ve had an interaction 
with them already.

Molly: 
But 
what 
if 
the 
government’s covering it up?
Cam *dead serious*: They 
wouldn’t do that to us.
Bailey: 
Are 
there 
any 
conspiracy theories y’all believe 
in?
Bill and program assistant 
Steve Shields entered the office 
from the smoothie room.
Johnny: Hey 
Shieldsy, you got 
any 
conspiracy 
theories?
Steve: 
I’ve 
got 
problems 
with conspiracy 
theories.
Molly: Which 
one?
Steve: All of 
‘em.
Molly: 
The 
moon landing?
Steve: That is the biggest 
conspiracy I have problems 
with.
Molly: That it was fake or 
that it was real?
Steve: No, the fact that 
you’re even saying that. I’ve 
got problems with the moon 
landing, with flat earth people.
Jay “The Beav” Flannelly, 
known acquaintance of Tom 
Brady, entered the room.
Bill: What’s your favorite 
Deflategate conspiracy theory?
The Beav: Uh, that it even 
existed. That’s the whole point.
Steve: Cheating’s a part of 
the game. If you’re not cheating, 
you’re not trying.
The Beav: Tom was never the 
target of that. I think we know 
who the target was. I don’t 
know, his coach?
Steve 
*suddenly 
reappearing*: Area 51.
Molly: You don’t think that’s 
real?
Steve: Do I think that aliens 
are real? No. There is a place 
called Area 51, but there’s no 
UFOs there.
Molly: But do UFOs in 
general exist?
Steve: No.

Molly: The universe is so big, 
there’s no way that they don’t.
Steve: The universe is so big? 
Prove it.
Molly: 
It’s 
constantly 
expanding. 
That’s 
physics. 
There are billions of galaxies.
Steve: 
If 
there 
were 
intelligent life forms somewhere 
in the universe, they would 
secretly 
come 
to 
this 
small 
little 
planet 
in a spaceship 
that 
we 
could 
recognize as a 
spaceship? 
It 
doesn’t 
make 
sense. Yeah, in 
theory, 100 years 
ago, before you 
knew 
anything 
existed 
beyond 
our sun, yeah. Yeah there’s 
people from outer space. But 
if they’re coming here, they’re 
coming here to kill us. It’s like 
the movies.
Assistant coach Kris Mayotte, 
who was standing next to Steve, 
chimed in.
Kris: Area 51’s real, what’s at 
Area 51 is fabricated.

Cam: Alright, let’s get this 
interview going.
Kris: Where do you gotta go?
Johnny: 
Eat 
dinner, 
homework.
Cam: Hang out with my 
girlfriend. Jeez.
The 
coaches 
trailed 
back 
to their half of the office, still 
arguing about aliens and Area 51.
Bailey: 
Who 
has 
the 
worst 
hair on the team?
Cam: 
Keto 
(freshman 
defenseman 
Keaton Pehrson).
Johnny: 
I 
don’t 
want 
to 
throw 
anybody 
under 
the 
bus. It’s kinda 
mean. 
I’d 
say 
(sophomore defenseman Nick) 
Blankenburg right now. He’s got 
a greasy mullet.
Cam: He does have a greasy 
mullet. We’ll both go with 
Blankenburg. Keto would be so 
pissed.
Johnny: He’d be mad at that.
Molly: When we did this 
with Keaton and Jack Summers, 

they said they wanted to be you, 
Cam. Which one of those two 
would you rather be?
Johnny: Definitely Sums.
Cam: Is neither an option? 
No, I’d be Sums.
Molly: Why?
Cam: He’s got good flow, he’s 
a pretty nice person.
Bailey: Johnny, what about 
you?
Johnny: 
Probably 
Luke 
Martin. 
He’s 
an 
absolute 
beauty. He’s one of the big boys 
with me, so I like that guy a lot. 
He’s funny. Fun to be around. If 
you’re him, you’re around him 
24/7. Just having a good time.
Bailey: Do either of y’all have 
any useless talents?
Johnny: Useless talents? Not 
really, honestly. I don’t really do 
weird stuff.
Cam: I definitely do, but I 
can’t think of any.
Johnny: Do you like juggling?
Cam: I can tie fishing knots 
really good.
Johnny: That’s not useless, 
though.
Cam: That’s true.
Johnny: If we’re on the 
stranded island, you need it.

‘M’ faces bad matchup against ‘Cats

Throughout the season, the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team has been plagued by one 
issue: turnovers. Last Sunday, 
against Rutgers, it survived 
the first half unscathed, taking 
care of the ball and instead 
forcing the Scarlet Knights into 
turnovers.
But as the teams came out 
of the locker room, Rutgers 
pressed — it needed to cut into 
the Wolverines’ 17 point lead as 
soon as possible. It couldn’t, but 
that wasn’t because Michigan 
broke through the press. In fact, 
the Wolverines continuously 
lost the ball, their turnover 
margin 
plummeting 
to 
a 
negative throughout the second 
half.
The Scarlet Knights just 
couldn’t 
capitalize, 
missing 
uncontested 
layup 
after 
uncontested layup — shooting 
34.8 percent in the fourth 
quarter.
“Then towards the end they 
turned it up a little bit, and 
we had a couple turnovers,” 
sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon said. “We’re gonna see 
our strengths and weaknesses 
in that and figure a couple 
more things out. With Kayla 
(Robbins) out, that’s another 
long person, tall person that 
could jump out of the gym, get 
those passes out of the air. But 
we’re gonna work on it.”
In Michigan’s upcoming game 
against No. 23 Northwestern, 
the turnover battle will be key. 
The Wildcats are second in 
the Big Ten in steals — behind 
only No. 17 Maryland, which 
dismantled 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offense earlier in the season, 
forcing 22 turnovers.
Northwestern also has a solid 
plus-6.7 turnover margin on the 
season while Michigan is in the 
middle of the pack in the Big 
Ten — barely squeaking out a 
positive ratio at plus-0.9.
The 
turnovers 
for 
the 
Wolverines 
have 
been 
notoriously topsy-turvy, though 
they 
rarely 
have 
two 
bad 
games in a row. After their first 
game against the Terrapins, 

they capped their turnovers 
in the low teens, sustaining 
a successful portion of their 
season. Until the rematch.
After 
struggling 
with 
turnovers in the last quarter 
against Rutgers, Michigan will 
need to continue its pattern of 
rebounding from large turnover 
games 
if 
it’s 
to 
compete 
Thursday.
It’ll also look to continue 
dominating the glass, where 
its 
plus-7.5 
rebounding 
margin 
is 
second best in 
the conference, 
while 
the 
Wildcats 
are 
one 
of 
three 
teams 
in 
the 
Big Ten with a 
negative margin 
at minus-0.4.
Second 
chance points, as they usually 
are, will be vital for Michigan 
against 
one 
of 
the 
best 
defenses in the conference — 
Northwestern holds opponents 
to 54.9 points per game.
But 
perhaps 
the 
biggest 
challenge for the Wolverines 
will come at the 3-point line. 
The Wildcats’ senior forward 
Abi Scheid stretches the floor 
and shoots at a team-leading .475 
clip, and Michigan has struggled 
throughout the season to match 
the momentum booster of the 
three with its post play.

“Most of the time going into 
the game (opponents have) had 
a poor shooting night before or 
multiple poor shooting nights, 
so we don’t really — I’m not 
saying we don’t defend the 
three — but we don’t exaggerate 
it as much as we should,” senior 
guard Akienreh Johnson said 
last week. “And then in the game 
when they start hitting them 
we don’t adjust. So we need to 
adjust getting out, taking away 
the 
shot 
and 
giving away the 
drive more the 
remainder 
of 
the game. Being 
able to adjust 
is 
something 
we 
have 
to 
consistently 
have to learn to 
do.”
Northwestern, 
though, 
isn’t 
coming into the game cold from 
downtown — it shot 40 percent 
in its last game, and Michigan 
will come into the match laser 
focused 
on 
defending 
the 
3-point arc. It won’t need to 
adjust.
The Wolverines face a tall 
task 
Thursday 
when 
they 
visit the Wildcats, a team that 
has strengths that appear to 
perfectly 
match 
Michigan’s 
weaknesses. The Wolverines 
will need to play one of their 
best games of the season in 
order to come out with a win.

Offseason fun helps build chemistry

Last weekend, the Michigan 
softball team took on a new 
challenge. A challenge that had 
coach Carol Hutchins worrying 
whether she or a team member 
would end up in the emergency 
room with an axe sticking out of 
their leg. 
Fortunately, 
everyone 
came 
out of the axe-throwing excursion 
unscathed, and the team had 
crowned an axe champion: junior 
infielder Taylor Bump.
This outing was part of the 
team’s offseason activities and 
one of the things the team got to 
do together that wasn’t directly 
softball-related. 
After practicing six days a week 
the entire offseason, Hutchins 
decided the team needed to do 
something fun to get away from the 
grind. The Wolverines had lunch 
together after practice, watched 
the men’s basketball game against 
Iowa and then she took them to the 
night’s main event.
“We just had fun together,” 
Hutchins said. “We’ve got to enjoy 
being around each other. You 
know, we’re different. We’re all 
diverse. We don’t all agree about 
everything, but we’re a team and 
you’ve got to get along with your 
teammates. So, we try to create 
some of those moments.”
Despite her fear that someone 
might 
put 
an 
axe 
through 
themself, Hutchins recognized 

the importance of taking time as 
a team off the field and what it 
means for the players. 
The Wolverines have gone on 
excursions in the past to find a 
relief from practice, laser tag being 
cited as a Hutchins favorite, but 
typically at the end of the season. 
In Hutchins’ 36 years of coaching, 
this is the first time they have done 
anything in the preseason. This 
is not to mention the team’s Cuba 
trip over fall break — also a first.
The Wolverines went to the 
country and spent time with each 
other as well as with a Cuban 
softball team. They brought over 
toiletries, gave the team gloves and 
dumped out their backpacks at the 
end of the trip to give to the team. 
In December, the team had its 
annual Christmas party where it 
played a game of white elephant 
and requipped with gifts of new 
gloves. This, along with the new 
experiences provided by the Cuba 
trip and axe throwing, gave the 
players a chance to bond with each 
other.
“I mean the most important 
thing, I think, is getting to 
know an individual teammate,” 
sophomore outfielder Lexie Blair 
said. “That’s what I feel like can 
build chemistry. … Us doing the 
team axe throwing, our Christmas 
parties, going to Cuba together. 
You kind of get to learn more about 
each other.”
And the hope, for Hutchins, is 
that the chemistry translates to 
the field.

Last year, Michigan started 
out its season 12-10 before coming 
home and straightening out to 
33-3 down the stretch. The slow 
start could be attributed to a lot of 
things — competition, readiness, 
overall performance — but the 
importance of teamwork and 
cohesion was not lost on Blair.
“Yeah, last year was a really 
slow start,” Blair said. “It’s just 
finding that chemistry within the 
team. Learning to mesh within 
each other, kind of finding a 
common ground and working 
together as one. That’s what you 
need to find for each team.”
Connection. 
Cohesion. 
Chemistry. However it’s stated, 
it’s important to the success of a 
softball team. Outs are made as 
a team. Runs are made as a team. 
Wins and losses come as a team. 
Blair recognizes this, and so does 
Hutchins. 
After losing five senior starters 
the Wolverines will need to find 
unity on a relatively young team. 
And quickly — the season starts in 
just nine days.
It is possible that a trip to Cuba, 
a Christmas party and an axe 
throwing competition could have 
done that for the Wolverines.
The only hint will be on the 
players’ faces. 
“A team that’s happy together 
plays better together,” Hutchins 
said. “No question.”
So when the team takes the field 
for the first time this season on 
Feb. 7 — watch for smiles.

What we did and didn’t learn in Nebraska win
T

wo months ago, when 
the Michigan men’s bas-
ketball team looked at 
its upcoming Big Ten schedule, a 
midweek trip to Lincoln probably 
didn’t ring any alarm bells.
The Wolverines had just beaten 
now-No. 2 Gonzaga in the Battle 4 
Atlantis championship game and 
jumped out to a 7-0 record to start 
the season.
That was 
then — and 
it feels like a 
lifetime ago.
Whatever 
Michigan may 
have thought 
at that point 
has been 
turned on its 
head. It lost 
junior forward 
Isaiah Livers to a groin injury 
and then a subsequent hip injury. 
It dropped five of six conference 
games in January. And to make 
matters worse, its senior point 
guard and unquestioned leader 
Zavier Simpson was suspended 
Monday for violating team policy. 
All that is to say, entering Tues-
day’s contest, what had previously 
appeared like a mundane road 
game was anything but. Without a 
true road win to date, the Wolver-
ines’ backs were against the wall 
and they needed to take a step 
forward. 
“Every team goes through 
adversity,” Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard said on Monday after-
noon. “Through a process like 
this, it defines character, and it 
builds character.”
In short, Michigan did take a 
step forward last night, albeit a 
small one. Collectively, the team 
filled the voids left by Livers and 
Simpson en route to a 79-68 vic-
tory over the Big Ten’s bottom-
dwellers — and looked good doing 
it. 
Junior guard Eli Brooks 
showed once again that he can be 
depended on both offensively and 
defensively, registering a stat line 
of 20 points, nine rebounds, four 
assists, a block and two steals. 

Freshman wing Franz Wagner’s 
18-point performance highlighted 
his potential, while sophomore 
forward Brandon Johns Jr. — typ-
ically the Wolverines’ spark-plug 
on the boards — had an impres-
sively efficient and career-high 
16 points. Others contributed 
too; sophomore guard David 
DeJulius took the reins at point 
and his classmate, Adrien Nunez, 
played 17 minutes despite recent 
struggles. 
And so, Michigan returns to 
Ann Arbor a bit more comfort-
able than when it departed. The 
Wolverines avoided disaster, and 
now at least have an opportunity 
to get back into good standing in 
the Big Ten. 
“It was a huge win for us,” 
Howard said after the victory. “To 
be able to get a road win, seeing 
the guys stepping up and giving 
us some minutes — Adrien Nunez, 
who hadn’t played in a while, but 
being able to give us a spark. It 
was a total team effort. Proud of 
all of our guys.”
And yet, given that everything 
looked so new and different, I feel 
obliged to ask: Did we learn any-
thing from last night’s win?
Anything? Yes, as onlookers, 
we learned something about this 
Michigan roster under How-
ard. The Wolverines responded, 
away from home, to a cascade of 
setbacks from the previous two 
weeks — showing mental forti-
tude and their acceptance of the 
“next man up” mentality. 
“I just liked how everybody 
stayed aggressive and was con-
fident out there,” Wagner said. 
“Obviously stuff went wrong, but 
I liked how we stayed the course. 
People stepped up and stayed 
ready.”
It’s also fair to say, in Brooks’ 
10th double figure game of the 
season, the junior is a key cog in 
Michigan’s machine. The Wol-
verines are 7-3 when he scores 
more than 10 points, and with Liv-
ers sidelined for the foreseeable 
future, Brooks’ ability to space the 
floor and knock down shots from 
the perimeter gives Michigan a 

much-needed dimension. 
Additionally, speaking to the 
team’s depth, we learned that 
the Wolverines can win without 
a dominant display from senior 
center Jon Teske. Despite holding 
a pronounced height advantage 
over the Cornhuskers’ 6-foot-9 
starting ‘5’ Yvan Ouedraogo, 
Teske only managed nine points 
on 4-of-7 shooting. Neverthe-
less, for the first time this season, 
Michigan won a game in which 
Teske didn’t reach double digits 
offensively. 
We learned all these things 
about the Wolverines — they can 
be perseverant and tough, Eli 
Brooks is a reliable outlet for them 
going forward and they’re deeper 
than we may have thought, win-
ning a game without Livers, Simp-
son and a stellar game from Teske. 
What we didn’t learn though, 
is whether Michigan will turn 
this taste of momentum into 

something more. Record wise, 
Nebraska is the second-worst 
team in the Big Ten at 2-8 and 
7-14 overall. In his first year in 
Lincoln, coach Fred Hoiberg has 
tried to implement the up-tempo 
offensive philosophy that was so 
successful during his stint at Iowa 
State, but doesn’t have the neces-
sary personnel yet. And so, while 
any win on the road in the Big Ten 
is a “good win,” they sure as hell 
aren’t all made equal. 
Michigan travels to Madison 
Square Garden at the end of the 
week to take on a resurgent No. 25 
Rutgers, ranked for the first time 
since 1979. A win in that game 
would register much higher on 
the Richter scale than yesterday’s. 
There is still a tremendous 
amount of uncertainty swirling 
around the Wolverines. According 
to Howard, Simpson’s one-game 
suspension was going to be “re-
evaluated” after the Nebraska 

game. With no official word yet on 
his status going forward, it may be 
a bit naïve to think Simpson will 
definitely be back by Saturday. 
Sure, DeJulius and Brooks played 
well in his stead, but to reiterate, 
that was against the Cornhuskers 
— the Scarlet Knights are a differ-
ent beast. 
“It was very important to see 
how much (Zavier) gives us every 
single day,” Wagner said after 
Tuesday’s game. “I can see now 
how much he does except just 
initiating the offense. There’s a 
lot more to (Zavier) than just X’s 
and O’s — to be able to talk, to get 
everybody involved and every-
body ready.”
Similarly, after suffering a 
hip injury in his first game back 
against Illinois, Livers’ situation is 
also up in the air. As documented, 
his absence extends well beyond 
his 13.6 points per game. His ath-
leticism and ability to space the 

floor opens up Michigan’s offense 
and allows Simpson — when he 
plays — Brooks, DeJulius and even 
Wagner to penetrate the opposing 
defense. 
Missing that veteran duo may 
have galvanized the Wolverines 
on Tuesday, but it seems foolish 
to believe they can adequately fill 
in for both Simpson and Livers 
against better opponents over the 
next few weeks. 
So yes, with the pressure on, 
Michigan bounced back in a big 
way against Nebraska. But at the 
same time, you’re quite the ideal-
ist if you believe the team is auto-
matically back on track after one 
road win. 
Then again, given the circum-
stances, maybe the Wolverines 
need to be optimists.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Youth is everywhere in music. Everyone wants 
it, remembers it, aches to return to it. In music, 
youth is the time when life is the fullest and 
the most exciting — late nights, hijinks, drugs, 
sex, crying and dancing. The days are short; 
the nights long; the years even longer. In song, 
youth is the perfect storm of irresponsibility and 
impressionability. You can do everything and 
anything, and it all feels important. 
There are so many songs about youth, about 
both living it and remembering it. Youth is visual, 
like all memories are: the fashion, the people and 
the places. But, of all the songs surrounding the 
idea of youth, those with particularly interesting 
music videos stuck out to me while trying to 
compile a best-of list. Which songs had videos 
that seemed to accurately reflect on some aspect 
of teenagerhood in the era in which they were 
produced? I narrowed it down to five songs 
about youth, all of which have music videos that 
feel especially “of their era,” acting as a visual 
record of the song’s subject. 

1) John Mellencamp, “Cherry Bomb” (1988)

“That’s when a sport was a sport, “Mellencamp 
sings, “And groovin’ was groovin’ / And dancin’ 
meant everything / We were young and we were 
improvin’.’” Who doesn’t want to be improvin’? 
The song is everything you want: sentimental 
but upbeat, with lyrics begging to be karaoked. 
There’s the requisite melancholy for days gone 
by, but what’s most palpable is Mellencamp’s joy 
at remembering the wonder and excitement of 
his adolescence. 
The music video is a moving collage of 
absurdity and sincerity: Found footage of teens 
in the ‘50s and ‘60s, accompanied by shots of 
a suspender-clad Mellencamp singing next to 
a jukebox as a teenage couple dances and feels 
each other up. Sometimes, the camera even 
cuts to Mellencamp doing his best Neil Young 
impression on a beach, wearing a denim jacket 
with no shirt. 

2) Lauryn Hill, “Doo-Wop (That Thing)” 
(1998)

Is this song about being young? I think so. 
I think it’s about the competing interests of 
youth — dressing right, having fun, falling in 
love without getting your heart broken. She’s 
instructing youth on how to find self-worth 
within impossibly challenging conditions. The 
problem, of course, is that the hot desires of 
young adulthood often run in opposition to other 
longings. Can you be cool and true to yourself? 
Respected and silly? These are the questions 
Hill addresses. The song could be considered 
preachy, but instead it’s moving. “Now, Lauryn 
is only human,” she sings. “Don’t think I haven’t 
been through the same predicament.” 
And the music video! It’s something else — a 
split-screen extravaganza of the late ‘50s, early 
‘60s sock hop aesthetic on the left and ‘90s 
Afropunk on the right. The video’s concept 
drives home the central point of the song: The 
same struggles will follow men and women 
through every generation. Youth are prone to 
compromising their values in search of love 
or a cure for loneliness, and they always have 
been. “How you gonna win, when you ain’t right 
within?” she asks. “Come again, come again, 
come again, come again.” 

3) Wheatus, “Teenage Dirtbag” (2000)

BBB wants us to think he’s all about rebellion 
and angst, but this song is about something far 
more tender: a crush. Do you remember the 
innocent fantasies of high school infatuation? It 
was a secret thrill — hoping that special person 
would sit next to you at lunch, or that they’d 
come up to you at a party, or that you’d be put in 
the same homeroom class. This is that feeling — 
a delicate hope, mixed with fear and self-doubt 
— wrapped up in a gleefully screamy alt-rock 
package. 
The music video is a melding together of 
original footage from the 2000 movie “Loser,” 
starring none other than Jason Biggs of 
“American Pie” fame. In the movie, Jason’s 
character has a crush on a girl who’s having an 

affair with a terribly pretentious English teacher 
(played by Greg Kinnear, of course). Problematic 
source material aside, the music video is such 
an embodiment of the early 2000s that, when 
watching, it feels as if long-dormant memories 
are surfacing rather than being created. The 
plot of the video is a daydream in which a boy 
discovers his crush is also a teenage dirtbag who 
loves Iron Maiden. “She’s walkin’ over to me, 
this must be fake / My lip starts to shake,” sings 
Brown. Biggs wakes up and the fantasy ends, but 
the world of the song — being a teenager and an 
outcast, hoping that the person that you love will 
reveal themselves to be just like you — lingers. 

4) Bronski Beat, “Smalltown Boy” (1984)

One of the top comments on the music video 
for “Smalltown Boy” is “I forgot the name of the 
song, so i searched ‘Gay train song 80s’ and this 
was the first video.” Yes, this is the seminal gay 
train song of the ‘80s, and it’s earned its place 
in the canon of music surrounding the struggles 
and joys of LGBTQ+ identity. “Smalltown Boy” 
is the sad prequel to “Take Your Mama” by the 

Scissor Sisters, cataloguing the grief of a teenage 
boy who must seek his fortune outside the 
prejudices of his hometown. “Mother will never 
understand why you had to leave,” sings Jimmy 
Somerville. “But the answers you seek will never 
be found at home.” 

Somerville’s signature falsetto, supported 
by a synth-heavy beat, narrates the story in 
terms vague enough that the song’s meaning 
isn’t always obvious. The music video, however, 
makes it painfully clear what the song is about. 
Somerville plays a gay teenager, riding a train 
and reminscing about his emerging sexuality 
and the reactions of his peers and parents. The 
song’s subject was especially groundbreaking at 
the time of its release in 1984, when the AIDS 
crisis was in full swing. The video, a nosedive 
into mid-‘80s Britain, is a moving portrait that 
ends on an unexpectedly happy shot of the 
protagonist stepping off the train with his new 
friends. The scene freezes, Somerville grinning 
at last. 

5) Asher Roth, “I Love College” (2009)

The lyrics of “I Love College” are probably 
not going to win any awards. “Man I love 
college (Hey!) / And I love drinking (Hey!) / I 
love women (Hey!) / Man I love college (Hey!).” 
It’s a silly romp of frat-rap about partying and 
drinking and weed and girls. But the music video 
for “I Love College” is a gem, displaying the 
conspicuous carelessness of party culture in full 
swing. Roth makes his way through the rooms 
of a house where a burn-it-down party is in full 
swing. 
Revelers make out, throw a mattress off a 
balcony and play strip poker. Someone dressed 
in a dinosaur costume simulates sex with a keg. 
Roth grins next to an unconscious, Sharpie-
covered partier getting a buzz cut, singing, 
“Don’t pass out with your shoes on.” It’s dumb 
and dangerous and it feels weirdly familiar, like 
this 11-year-old party could have happened last 
weekend. 
It’s hard to say anything about being young 
without falling into the dangerous territory of 
aphorisms. These artists say something new, but 
they also say all the old things. Run away, find 
yourself, fall in love. “When I think back about 
those days / All I can do is sit and smile,” sings 
Mellencamp. Go West, young man — you’re only 
young once.

“Everything I 
Wanted”

Billie Eilish

Interscope

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: 
‘EVERYTHING I WANTED’

Right before the final 
award of the night was 
announced 
at 
the 
2020 
Grammys, Billie Eilish could 
be seen whispering, “Please 
don’t 
be 
me.” 
Moments 
later, her name was called 
— making Eilish the night’s 
biggest winner. Her music 
video “everything i wanted” 
details the fear that comes 
with her kind of fame. 
Eilish has never been 
one to shy away from dark 
subject matters. However, 
“everything i wanted” feels 
distinctly 
personal. 
Not 
only did Eilish direct the 
video herself, her brother 
and collaborator, FINNEAS, 
is her only co-star. It opens 
up 
with 
Billie 
driving 
Finneas through a sunset 
San 
Francisco-esque 
cityscape. Yet as the pattern 
of 
skyscrapers 
repeat, 

blinking along to the music, 
it becomes clear that she’s 
really driving through her 
dreamscape. 
According 
to an interview with BBC 
Radio 1, the song itself is 
based on a dream Eilish had 
in which she committed 
suicide and everyone turned 

on her. As horrifying as that 
sounds, Billie drives blank-
faced. She doesn’t need to 
acknowledge the lyrics that 
weave together her image-
related 
anxieties, 
they 
already feel present — and 
heavy.

“everything 
i 
wanted” 
ends ominously. Billie and 
Finneas drive onto the beach 
and then floor it into the 
ocean, where the car sinks. 
In these final scenes, it’s 
obvious that this video is as 
much about Eilish’s mental 
health as it is about her 
relationship to her brother. 
He mouths the lyrics “they 
don’t deserve you” and takes 
her hand with a smile as they 
go deeper into the water. 
This allows for a glimmer of 
optimism. Although they’ve 
both been consumed by the 
darkness of being in the 
spotlight, they still have 
each other — and a lot more 
success — ahead of them.

DARKROOM AND INTERSCROPE

“B.I.T.C.H.”

Megan Thee Stallion

Roc Nation

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘B.I.T.C.H.’

Hot Girl Meg marks her 
return this winter with a 
new single: “B.I.T.C.H.” The 
new single will appear on her 
upcoming studio album Suga, 
named after Stallion’s new 
alter ego. The song samples 
Tupac’s All Eyez on Me song 
“Rather Be Ya N**ga” (a track 
that samples Bootsy Collins’s 
single “I’d Rather Be with 
You”). “B.I.T.C.H” embodies 
the same swagger and groove 
as its throwback inspiration, 
but with Megan’s own sexy 
twist. Whereas Tupac wants 
to get with his muse, Megan 
maintains her independence 
and commands respect on 
her track. “I’d rather be a 
B.I.T.C.H., ’cause that’s what 
you gonna call me when I’m 
trippin’ anyway / You know 
you can’t control me, baby 
/ You need a real one in 
your life,” she asserts in the 

chorus. 
Despite the vintage bubble 
wrap, “B.I.T.C.H.” does not 
run the risk of sounding out of 
place from Megan’s standard 
discography. The tune is just 
as sexy and fun as it was 
when Tupac first introduced 
it in 1996, but with a raunchy 

twist; 
this 
rendition’s 
twinkly, romantic plinking is 
a lot more downplayed under 
slight trap inflections. With 
“B.I.T.C.H.” Stallion doesn’t 
want to appeal to anyone 
so much as she strives to 
position herself as a force 

worth reckoning with. She is 
cool, calm, talented and sexy 
without having to comply 
with anyone’s standards.
The banger flourishes over 
a bouncy, funky beat. Sultry 
whispers of “I’d rather keep 
it real with ya” echo to signal 
the 
delicate 
vulnerability 
that tinges the track. Despite 
Megan’s 
reputation 
and 
her assertion of dominance 
and 
independence, 
she 
recognizes 
her 
man’s 
ignorance of her feelings. 
It’s not that she’s drawing 
his attention so much as 
she’s pushing him away; she 
refuses to waste her time on 
someone who won’t devote 
any to her.

Thursday, January 30, 2020 — 3B

Only the lucky ones get to experience the highs and lows of human 
existence. Despite how special your parents insisted you were when you 
were a kid, some emotions are universal — happiness, sadness, nostalgia, 
heartbreak — these emotions that simmer in our core are what bonds 
us as humans. But emotions are delicate. The same happiness you feel 
when you get accepted into your favorite college can easily be elicited 
by your two favorite fictional characters finally confessing their feelings 
for one another. The same deep sadness you get from failing an exam 
could easily be duplicated by an unexpected fatal car crash in your 
favorite television drama series. The cause for these emotions may 
change over time, but the feelings they stir within us remain the same.
I remember being devastated by Troy and Gabriella’s separation in 
“High School Musical 3,” which, over time, evolved into the way I felt 
when Nick and Jess broke up that one time in “New Girl.” Different 
causes, different stakes, same pit of emptiness. In hindsight, sure, I can 
now judge things more realistically. Troy and Gabriella probably should 
have gone separate ways. 
By the time I watched “La La Land” with my early-teenage sister, 
I could tell I was old by how I appreciated the realistic ending whilst 
she was heartbroken over it. At her age, I would’ve likely felt the same 
way, but now, I can’t even imagine being so hung up over something 
that wouldn’t have been right. I tried to help her appreciate the reality 
behind it, but to her, it was a cinematic tragedy. Though we’re only 
four years apart, there was something about our age gap that made us 

different enough to see Mia and Sebastian’s amorous demise in opposite 
ways. 
I’m not sure when the switch happened. Maybe it’s because I realized 
“Gossip Girl” was feeling a little incestuous, or more practically, maybe 
it was because sometimes in my later teenage years, I was given a 
glimpse of what adults have been threatening me with my entire life: the 
real world. All of a sudden, I was expected to know not just my career 
path, but also my five-year plan and how to avoid scams. Life wasn’t so 
glamorous anymore, and I started to watch television in the same way. 
Call me jaded, but “The Office” became funniest when I realized 
that coworkers could really be that stupid and offices really do waste 
that much time on a daily basis. “Parks and Recreation” is at its peak 
when you realize that characters like Councilman Jamm exist in real 

life and make up over half of Congress. When shows can cleverly mimic 
the chaos we experience on a daily basis, it becomes more real to us the 
longer we live. 
Still, everything feels like a finality. When I was younger, and mass-
consumed “Riverdale”-esque shows thinking that they were the epitome 
of television, nothing else appealed to me. I’ll watch shows like this for 
the rest of my life, and it’s all I really need, I thought. Embarrassing, but 
there’s a reason why I can barely remember the shows I was addicted to 
when I was a teenager. They were iterations of one another, and looking 
back, they were as micro in perspective as we are when we’re younger.
I suppose I can’t bash on these shows entirely. For teens, they 
provide comfort — an escape from mundane life. Their impracticality 
isn’t exactly what teenagers are worried about when they watch them. 
For a lot of teenagers, raw emotion is really all they need to feel when 
they watch television. All they need is a stretched image of the life that 
they secretly hoped they could live — a high school drama they could 
vicariously live through, despite the absurdity of it all. 
There’s a side of me that wonders whether there’s any nostalgia tied 
into this mess. I’ve rewatched plenty of shows too many times, and 
while I don’t get the same intensity of reactions that I did from my first 
time, I’m temporarily brought back to the headspace I was in at that 
moment. There are few shows that bring me back in the same way that 
music might, mainly because we listen to music to match our emotions, 
while we often watch tv to make us feel emotions. Most of the time, I 
watch television in random places: in bed, on the treadmill, when I’m 
supposed to be working. Watching a show straight through means 
that, no matter what mood we’re in, the show can be factored into our 
schedule. When we listen to music, or even watch movies, it’s more of 
an emotional commitment — most people carefully tailor them to act 

parallel with how we feel in an instance.
I realize I might have contradicted myself multiple times throughout 
the duration of this recorded stream of consciousness. The reality 

is that television serves different purposes in our life: a distraction, 
white noise, a mood booster, an excuse to bond with a loved one. As we 
continue to grow older, our search for more doesn’t stop with television, 
and it likely never will. This doesn’t mean shows like “Keeping Up with 
the Kardashians” or “The Bachelor” lose all value — even a trash fire is 
entertaining sometimes — but it will never be as satisfying as a show 
that draws you in from the deepest parts of your core and keeps you 
there for reasons that you might not be able to explain. When a creator 
loves their show, you can tell. And that care is what we search for when 
we’re older, because it means that our microscopic presence in the 
world is acknowledged. We’re seen.

B-SIDE: TV NOTEBOOK
The TV of our youth and how it shapes our realities

SOPHIA YOON
Daily TV Editor

There are few shows that bring me 
back in the same way that music might, 
mainly because we listen to music to 
match our emotions, while we often 
watch TV to make us feel emotions.

When a creator loves their show, you 
can tell. And that care is what we 
search for when we’re older, because it 
means that our microscopic presence in 
the world is acknowledged. We’re seen.

I am not the first to say that the later years of middle school 
and early high school were hell. Nor will I be the last. That must 
be one of the few universal truths of childhood. And as someone 
who has struggled with mental illness, especially so in those 
oh-so-cringeworthy years, those pains of adolescence were 
only amplified. Mental illness is by no means uncommon — my 
experiences aren’t unique — but there are still a few emotions and 
sensations that I have never been able to translate fully into words, 
nor have I seen others have much luck with the feat. So, when I 
read Jeffrey Eugenides’s novel “The Virgin Suicides,” I was caught 
off guard. Narrated by a group of now-grown neighborhood boys 
several decades after the events of the main story, the novel is 
about the successive suicides of the five Lisbon sisters and the 
boys’ desperate attempts to uncover why these girls of American 
suburbia killed themselves. The novel explores themes of sex and 
sexuality, femininity and misogyny, mental illness and emotional 
isolation, taboos and all the weird, gross and sticky feelings that 
accompany the early teen years.
What was so interesting about this novel is that, somehow, 
both the narrators and the sisters articulated some aspect of 
my own experiences with mental illness in middle and high 
school. The experiences of these characters obviously don’t 
perfectly align with my own: I can’t speak to the experiences 
of those who are objectified, sexualized and repressed, nor can 
I say I’ve ever shared the misogynistic views of the narrators. 
However, the community and characters portrayed ring familiar 
nonetheless. From the obsessive and insulting way the community 
sensationalizes and elevates the five young girls following their 

deaths, to the deep social anxiety and desperate loneliness that 
both the neighborhood boys and the five sisters exhibit, this book 
was an emotional echo of what I experienced and saw in the early 
days of my struggle with mental illness.
Most reflective of my adolescent years was the novel’s depiction 
of the Lisbon sisters. In particular, the physical and emotional 
isolation the remaining four sisters endured in the wake of 
Cecilia’s death captured my own persistent, pre-teen feeling of 
estrangement.
After about a year of the community’s collective obsession over 
Cecilia’s suicide, the other four Lisbon girls fall into a passive 
acceptance of their grim reality and grow cynical of the world 
around them. They seem disillusioned by the superficiality and 
hypocrisy of the community, their feeling of disconnect only 
amplified further by their entrapment in the echo chamber of 
suicidality. I felt trapped in a similar mindset for years, but the 
similarities run even deeper. Towards the end of middle school, I 
began to notice that when tragedies and deaths occurred, people 
who never associated themselves with the individuals in question 
began to reflect on how well they knew them. And while this is 
not something that is exclusive to youth, going through such a 
difficult time myself made me see these fairweather mourners in 
a different light. 
The narrators note that a bench donated in honor of the girls’ 
memory labelled them as the “daughters of this community, 
despite how secluded the Lisbon sisters were from the rest of the 
community,” Moving beyond the clear irony of the bench, the 
most frustrating phenomenon the book depicts is the narrators’ 
reductionary idealization of and projection onto five girls who 
they, in reality, seldom talked to. “They were too beautiful for 
this world, they were perfect, they were so kind…” As I mentioned 
earlier, performative claims of personal connection in the 
aftermath of a death are a very common phenomenon. One could 

chalk it up to any number of reasons: selfishness, illusions of 
importance or even blatant hypocrisy. Regardless, “The Virgin 
Suicides” highlights the superficiality inherent in this reaction to 
tragedy.
In contrast to the clear parallels I saw between my experiences 
and those of the Lisbon sisters, the similarities I found between 
the experiences of the neighborhood boys and my own are a bit 
more indirect. The neighborhood boys are problematic to say the 
least, but they do embody the agony of being an emotional and 
distraught pre-pubescent middle schooler. As someone who has 
always been shy and, consequently, never great at making new 
friends, I recognized the longing for friendship born out of their 
emotional isolation. Though my own experiences with this were 
more akin to what my friend terms “friend crushes,” (or, meeting 
someone who you think seems really cool, but you are too nervous 
to actually try to be their friend) the underlying social anxiety, 
over-analyzation and daydreaming that the narrators experience 
rings familiar. 

It’s been years since middle school, and I’m guessing that for 
most people reading this, looking back on those times isn’t at 
the top of your to-do list. But, with a book as entrenched in the 
nuanced horrors of middle school as “The Virgin Suicides,” it’s 
difficult not to remember that time period. As opposed to the 
community depicted in “The Virgin Suicides,” we, as readers, 
don’t need to remain stagnant, obsessing over the past. From 
those terrible adolescent years emerges (hopefully) an individual 
who can look back on that time and appreciate how much growth 
has occurred and how much growth there is to come. From stories 
such as these, of those who can never hope to understand why 
suicides occur, of others who are disillusioned and objectified by 
the world around them, we can recognize why growth beyond our 
adolescence is so important, and how much clinging to narrow 
and reductionist views can warp our realities. As we move into 
the future, the problems we face will change, and we will as well.

The experiences of these characters

DISNEY


So, I have this theory. Protagonists Christine “Lady Bird” 
McPherson of the 2017 film, “Lady Bird” and Frances Halladay 
of the 2012 film “Frances Ha” are the same character. If you’ve 
seen both of their eponymous movies, maybe you’ve instinctively 
understood their superficial connections to one another; Both 
are from Sacramento, attend school in New York and explore the 
concept of youth with unmistakably bright verve.
Yet, to pretend that their connective tissue is coincidence would 
be silly. They are both pieces of Greta Gerwig’s own experiences 
(she wrote and directed “Lady Bird” on top of penning “Frances 
Ha”). For me, it’s impossible to totally separate the characters, 
because, despite their myriad differences, they speak together 
in a pricklingly honest way about what it means to become an 
adult amid the brilliance, failures and compromises of one’s own 
dreams.
“Sophie and I are the same person with different hair.”
Let’s be clear about something. Where Frances and Lady 
Bird are similar — in their confident insistence on their own 
goals, the economic constraints on their passions and a clarity 
in communication that leaps out of them even when they aren’t 
speaking — they are vastly different too. Lady Bird is frequently 
stoic, incessant and self-certain about her desires, while Frances 
often holds back with immeasurable wisdom. 
But these divergent character inflections are what make their 
connection so fascinating. If “Lady Bird” explores the idealism 
and the beckoning promise of growing up, then “Frances Ha” 
admits the necessary, all-consuming strife that comes with that 
pursuit. Lady Bird’s dreams are soaring, luminous promises more 
than they are tangible things. She wants to move out of what 
she dubs “the Midwest of California” and expand her cultural 
horizons. She wants the world to know who she is. 
Frances, while never explicitly shying away from any of 
these hopes, finds herself constrained by her (literally) gray 
surroundings. For her, the steps in achieving what she wants are 
often sacrifices. Staying on a lease with her roommate means 
damaging her relationship with her boyfriend. Flying to France 
for two days to see a colleague is an utter and lonely waste. 
Moreover, while Lady Bird’s friends possess a similarly 
unbridled optimism towards their dreams, Frances’s become 
stilted and hideously practical with adulthood. Nearly every word 
out of Lady Bird’s mouth is a declaration, a fact or an idea she 
means to make fact, whether it be her own stern insistence of her 
nickname or a heated blow towards her mother: “You give me a 
number for how much it cost to raise me, and I’m going to get 
older and make a lot of money and write you a check for what I 
owe you so that I NEVER HAVE TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN.” 
Perhaps Frances’s only comparably open moment is her 
monologue about love: “sort of like how they say other dimensions 
exist all around us but we don’t have the ability to perceive them. 
That’s ... that’s what I want out of a relationship.” Yet, upon this 
profound offering, her adult friends (mostly couples) merely nod 
and stare in silence. For them, the reality of love is likely a shade 
of Frances’ moving characterization. And regardless of whether 
her words are a futile wish or a demonstration of her mystical 
patience, it doesn’t matter. Lady Bird’s proud and electrifying 
defiance strikes eager, convivial peers. Frances’s words bounce 
off of deaf ears.
“I just got a tax rebate. You wanna go to dinner?”

Gerwig has demonstrated an uncanny ability to weave in 
threads of economic anxiety into her characters in a way that 
feels simultaneously real, essential and somehow optimistic. 
This is integral to both films; despite the differences in how Lady 
Bird and Frances articulate their wishes, they both encounter 
formidable financial obstacles in realizing them.

For Lady Bird, this economic anxiety manifests in the struggle 
of paying student loans. For her, the higher cost of attending 
school in New York is about so much more than the monetary 
value; she sees the city as a vibrant expression of the eccentric, 
marrow-deep creativity she has harbored inside of her for her 
whole life. For Frances, New York holds all of the same promise 
— it’s a stage where Frances can pursue her dreams of dancing. At 
the same time, the everyday economic struggles she faces come 
at direct cost to her — both socially and professionally. Moving in 
with her new friends means risking their frustration when she’s 
fired from a Christmas show at her dance company. In the midst 
of achieving her true aspirations, the limits of paying her bills 
have bitingly real consequences. On the other hand, Lady Bird’s 
ignorance about her own family’s financial burdens lasts until 
those burdens implicate her directly — refinancing a mortgage to 

pay student loans, shame at the comparative appeal of her house 
compared to her classmates.
The sacrifices Frances and Lady Bird must make due to their 
socioeconomic statuses may differ, and so do their ultimate 
outcomes. For Frances, adulthood salvation comes in the form 
of compromise, keeping an artistically meaningless office job at 
her old job in order to also hone her choreography skills. Lady 
Bird’s reckoning in the last few moments we see her — or perhaps, 
Christine’s, since here she reverts to her given name — are less 
overtly economic, but imply a transaction too. At a greater cost to 
her own family, she has moved far away from Sacramento. That 
distance should be freeing, but Christine’s ambiguous, unsure 
expression suggests otherwise. 
Gerwig, Master of the Self-Portrait
One pleasant surprise from the ending of Gerwig’s “Little 
Women” was the juxtaposition of the character Jo March onto 
the life of source text author Louisa May Alcott. The writer-
director turns Jo into the narrator of the story we’re watching, 
which demonstrates Gerwig’s understanding of the relationship 
between art and the artist. 
For Gerwig and those that love her work, that journey is surely 
worth the price. Beginning as a New York actress, in circumstances 
not dissimilar to Halladay’s, she has become without a doubt one 
of the most exciting directors today. 
To create films centered around their author is a bold and 
impressive feat if executed with the indelible care that Gerwig 
has. And between Lady Bird, Frances Halladay and Jo March, 
Gerwig shows genuinely impressive vulnerability in articulating 
the kinds of obstacles that the creators of art face. But in the 
search for an optimistic ending, perhaps one has to look no further 
than Gerwig herself, who has championed her own experiences in 
service of a parable that her whole career has been building to: the 
harrowing, surging, all-consuming process of making art can be 
artful in itself.

Sometimes an album’s lyrical content alludes to themes that explicitly 
or tangentially reflect the experiences and mentalities of younger 
people. Sometimes an album features a sound that evokes a youthful 
energy, like through springy chords or energetically chaotic melodies. 
Often the mere happenstance of an album’s release date aligning with 
the listener’s childhood can grant it a youthful quality in and of itself. 
MGMT managed to fulfill this trifecta as they unearthed the anthology 
of adolescent anthems better known as Oracular Spectacular. Though 
this quality of the album is obvious enough in isolation, it is impossible 
to ignore when the album is held alongside MGMT’s most recent full-
length creation, Little Dark Age. 
The differences in age begin to reveal themselves long before the first 
second of audio is played. Oracular Spectacular’s tracklist alone sets the 
tempo for the type of energy the record conveys as tracks like “Kids” 
and “The Youth” catch the listener’s attention as they hover above the 

play button. Conversely, “When You Die” and “Days That Got Away” 
indicate that Little Dark Age lacks the upbeat, carefree emotions of its 
predecessor of 11 years. But the forwardness of these indications does 
not undermine the substance of the actual songs, which further their 
titles’ indications of distinct points of maturity while contributing to 
equally distinct and high-quality albums.
In the very first verse of Oracular Spectacular, MGMT wastes no 
time caricaturing themselves as reckless young adults; they do so in a 
manner so hyperbolic that one would expect their words to come from 
a sitcom elder before telling the neighborhood delinquents to vacate the 
lawn. In the opening seconds of “Time to Pretend,” after asserting that 
they’re in the prime of their lives, MGMT have laid out their goals — 
getting rich quick, driving luxury cars, doing a medley drugs, marrying 
models, the works. As fluttery synths continue to remind the reader not 
to worry, MGMT defend their shortsightedness, pointing out that a short 
but eventful life beats out a monotonous job anyday. The song then goes 
from adolescent to altogether childlike, with the lyrics now reminiscing 
of playground days and an ultimate carelessness that couldn’t even be 

touched by later aspirations of living carelessly. Those were the days.
MGMT’s discussion of what they wanted to do takes on a sharply 
different meaning when it appears in the Little Dark Age song “One 
Thing Left to Try.” The more distorted and solemn synths that permeate 
through this album help the group convey their maturity and mortality 
on this track and others. MGMT profess their fear of dying knowing 
they had something left on their bucket list and imply that there will 
inevitably be something left on this list. Yes, this is the same MGMT 
that wants nothing more than to die young after a bout of euphoria and 
could not be less interested in the nuances of adulthood. But dying young 
and experiencing highs still remain on their mind, as though MGMT 
are unsure if they are fully ready to abandon their prior thrill-seeking, 
indifferent-to-death mentality. The bridge of the song finds itself in a 
tug-of-war as “Do you want to keep us alive?” and “Do you want to feel 
alive” are repeated over and over, as though the two are paradoxically 
mutually exclusive. This segment may hint that MGMT are scantly more 
mature than they were 11 years ago, but really, it parallels the nostalgia 
they expressed in “Time to Pretend.” Just as they once fantasized about 
the comfort of a childhood lacking responsibilities, they now remember 
the excitement of being a reckless, adrenaline-seeking adolescent. 
There is always something in the future left to do, and there is always 
something to reflect on from the past.
And there truly are concepts worth reflecting on from MGMT’s 
past. There are insightful moments throughout Oracular Spectacular, 
but they can be overshadowed by the more pervasive and less overtly 
thought-provoking dialogue. Perhaps this is reflective of adolescents 
— we are capable of birthing great ideas when we put our minds to it, 
but we’re not always putting our minds to it. There’s no denying that 
the notions of living in the moment established in “Time to Pretend” 
play a key role in the duration of the album; their interlockings with 
upbeat chords and psychedelic, dream-like sounds and imagery give the 
album its recognizably youthful sound. But the progressive warnings 
and beliefs sprinkled throughout the record are equally representative 

of the un-aged vigor that the album exudes. Throughout “Kids,” MGMT 
repeatedly urge the listener to be sustainable and wary of their usage of 
the Earth’s resources. “Control yourself, take only what you need from 
it.” Their proposed wariness extends to monetary resources as well. In 
“The Handshake,” MGMT stresses that people’s losses in the acquisition 
of great wealth can outweigh the wealth itself. “Black credit cards and 
shoes / You can call all the people you want / But it’s you who’s being 
used.” Maybe they’re more than just adolescent heathens.
The problems tackled in Little Dark Age tend to be more 
individualized, but they are also the ones that younger people — 
especially those described in MGMT’s debut album — are content 
not to concern themselves with just yet. The younger MGMT seem 
more than content with lustful, passionate exchanges like the one in 
“Electric Feel,” but Little Dark Age is punctuated by the mixed results 
of sought relationships. “She Works Out Too Much” and “When You 
Die” highlight the frustrations of someone who is at the age to settle 
down but can’t find success. Fortunately, the cycle might be broken in 
the `80s sounding piece “Me and Michael,” as the title pair are “solid as 
they come” and may end up having the enduring long-term relationship 
that many in their thirties yearn for.
There is another recently-developed, close attachment analyzed 
in Little Dark Age. “TSLAMP” stands for “Time Spent Looking At 
My Phone,” and it is time that MGMT resents. Often disregarded as 
a boomer-centric ideology projected upon younger generations, the 
condemnation of phone usage in the song is actually self-critical for 
MGMT. The group expresses personal disgust — over an inability to 
look away from the phone, over a terror at the prospect of its battery 
dying, over a love for the inanimate object. This exemplifies the 
album’s overarching nostalgia. MGMT recognize that their struggles 
with mortality, relationships and phones were much less prevalent in 
Oracular Spectacular’s 2007. But they accept that they’re at a little dark 
age, and they’re working and willing to get past it.

In 2011, a 12 year-old girl 
sat in her desk chair facing 
away from a computer in a 
dimly lit California bedroom. 
A film crew recorded as she 
worked on math homework. 
Later, the same girl stood in a 
dance studio, her small frame 
covered in only a blue leotard 
and pink tights and her right 
leg lifted at a 180-degree angle. 
Her arms rested delicately in 
ballet’s fourth position, and 
she balanced her lifted body on 
only the ball of her left foot. 
The girl was Miko Fogarty, 
a featured dancer in the 2012 
documentary “First Position” 
by 
Bess 
Kargman, 
which 
covered the lives of seven 
children, ranging in age from 
10 to 17, in their pursuit of 
success at the Youth America 
Grand Prix ballet competition. 
The award-winning film shed 
light into the unknown world 
of blistered toes and broken 
dreams that is a ballet student’s 
reality. 
Though 
the 
90-minute 
documentary 
offered 
many 
gems 
of 
insight 
into 
the 
pressure placed on children 

in pursuit of success in ballet, 
Miko’s story might be the most 
interesting. By the time “First 
Position” was filmed, she had 
already begun homeschooling 
in order to allow more time 
for ballet classes. Her family 
had moved houses to be closer 
to the dance studio and her 
mother had hired a stretching 
coach 
to 
build 
on 
Miko’s 
existing elasticity. Her young 
body was well on its way to 
being molded into an idealized 
vision of the perfect ballerina: 
thin, stretchy, and strong. 
Beyond the physique, though, 
she was truly an exceptional 
dancer. She could balance and 
turn 
with 
mouth-watering 
precision and her arms moved 
through the air like graceful 
droplets of water in the gentle 
wind. 
She 
performed 
with 
unprecedented strength and 
grace beyond her years, and in 
doing so caught the attention 
of millions of fans. Videos of 
her competition appearances 
garnered 
international 
attention and her Instagram 
account accrued hundreds of 
thousands of followers. In every 
sense of the word, she was one 
of ballet’s first “influencers.” 
She was also, in every sense of 
the word, a child. 
But young Fogarty didn’t 

seem to mind. In the movie, she 
told filmmakers, “I think I’ve 
just had the right amount of 
childhood and the right amount 
of ballet.” She was content with 
the long hours, sore muscles 
and lack of sleepovers. She 
loved it that much. This isn’t a 
foreign concept to dancers — 
smile while you lift your head, 
point your toes, turn out your 
feet and you’ll be on your way 
to finding a job. 
 That’s what Fogarty did — in 
2015, she joined the corps de 
ballet of England’s prestigious 
Birmingham Royal Ballet. The 
world sat back and waited. We 
figured it’d be a year, maybe 
two, before she climbed her 
way to prima ballerina. But 
12 months later, Fogarty was 
nowhere to be found. Her 
instagram sat untouched and 
her stage appearances were 
nonexistent. She stayed in the 
dark for several years before 
reappearing as a junior at 
the University of California, 
Berkely, studying biology. She’d 
completely started over. 
Most of the ballet world, 
shocked 
as 
they 
were, 
supported her drastic shift. 
Many still follow her pre-med 
journey with as much fanfare 
as they did her ballet, invested 
in her success no matter where 

she finds it. This has been 
heartwarming to watch, and 
Fogarty spoke openly about her 
appreciation for the positive 
reactions. 
Nevertheless, 
her 
story remains an interesting 
perspective on the darker side 
of children in dance. 
Ballet 
favors 
the 
young. 
Whether this is good or bad 
is often beside the point — 
above 
all, 
it 
is 
necessary. 
As choreographers push for 
increasingly 
diverse 
and 
athletic 
movement, 
dancers 
push for more strength, more 
flexibility, more speed, more 
grace. They ask as much (and 
even more) of their bodies as 
NFL players, and one can only 
do that for so long. An athlete 
only has so many seasons 
before their body is too tired or 
broken to keep going. With that 
limit in sight, the inspiration 
to start as soon as possible is 
strong. 
Dancers 
will 
typically 
join a company 
toward the end 
of 
high 
school; 
often, promising 
candidates will be 
offered contracts 
at 16. To get to a 
professional level 
by 
then, 
most 
ballet 
students 
start 
training 
before the age of 
five, usually as 
early as three. 
 This dedication 
is often glorified 
through 
depictions 
like 
“First 
Position,” 
in 
which audiences 
oggle 
the 
lives 
of 
performative 
glory 
led 
by 
children decades 
younger 
than 
them, but behind 
the stage curtain 
there 
is 
often 
more 
to 
the 
story. 
When 
Miko 
Fogarty 
reappeared after 
her 
hiatus, 
she 
told 
stories 
of 
serious eating disorders, sexual 
abuse from her childhood ballet 
teacher and a distinct lack of 
joy that started long before she 
quit. 
Ballet’s 
reliance 
on 
the 
historically thin lines of a 
human 
body 
unfortunately 
makes eating disorders common 
(though we have recently seen 
an 
increase 
in 
prevention 

education), and the skewed 
power dynamics borne out of 
over-traditionalized non-verbal 
classroom atmospheres leads 
to a heartbreaking number 
of stories in the #MeToo era. 
Plenty of people write about 
this. 
Among 
these 
issues, 
as 
important 
as 
they 
are, 
I 
notice one that is harder to 
discern: the construction of 
a child’s reality. For dancers 
like Fogarty, ballet becomes 
synonymous with life at a very 
young age. Rehearsal quickly 
becomes more important than 
school and social lives are 
replaced with technique class. 
In “First Position,” 12-year-
old Fogarty told the world that 
“most kids my age, they’re not 
100 percent sure what they’re 
going to do, but I know I’m 
going to do ballet for the rest 
of my life.” In the context of 

the film, this statement was 
inspirational. She was working 
hard — most likely harder than 
you. She was dedicated, driven 
and focused. But she was also 
not even a teenager yet. She 
had never consciously lived in a 
state of not knowing what one 
wants to do. 
As a woman who lives in 
constant fearful excitement of 

my life’s unknown opportunity, 
hearing young Fogarty speak 
with such confident tunnel 
vision makes me deeply sad. 
The dance industry does this 
a lot. Teachers push students 
to stretch more and balance 
longer all with the end goal 
of becoming a professional. 
In doing so, ballet dancers 
are never given the chance 
to find themselves at a time 
when identity formation is at 
its peak: adolescence. In doing 
so, 
we 
create 
exhilarating 
athletes with gorgeous physical 
capabilities, but we do not create 
artists. We do not give students 
time to develop the one concept 
that 
makes 
dance 
dance. 
As a result, we’re left with 
thousands of students onstage 
at 
competitions 
performing 
pieces wrought with emotions 
that they themselves have never 
experienced. It’s misguided, 
hollow 
and 
annoying 
to 
watch. 
I don’t intend 
to 
reflect 
on 
Fogarty’s 
life 
for her. Perhaps 
this path was 
exactly 
what 
she needed, and 
there is nothing 
wrong 
with 
having changed 
careers. To see 
anyone 
taking 
control of their 
happiness is a 
success 
story 
to 
me. 
That 
said, I believe 
there 
is 
and 
always 
should 
be 
room 
for 
life 
alongside 
dance. 
In 
a 
YouTube series 
on New York 
City 
Ballet, 
principal 
dancer 
Sara 
Mearns 
once 
said it took a 
debilitating 
back 
injury 
to 
give 
her 
the 
chance 
to become an

for 
mental 
balance 
outside

Balance, 
as 
Mearns

is 
a prerequisite for artistry. By 
forgetting to encourage artistry, 
we disable dance students in ballet

reward a world of dedication, 
then, we must construct a world of 
freedom, too.

Young Fogarty didn’t seem to 
mind. In the movie, she told 
filmmakers, “I think I’ve just had 
the right amount of childhood 
and the right amount of ballet.” 
She was content with the long 
hours, sore muscles and lack of 
sleepovers. She loved it that much. 
This isn’t a foreign concept to 
dancers — smile while you lift 
your head, point your toes, turn 
out your feet and you’ll be on your 
way to finding a job.

B-SIDE COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK
B-SIDE COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

Compared to the standard 
lively 
chatter 
and 
packed 
tables of a typical afternoon, 
there was a hushed silence as I 
climbed the stairs of the popular 
Ann Arbor coffee shop above 
Literati Bookstore just before 
7:00 pm. Instead of the sunlight 
illuminating study groups and 
friends 
working 
side-by-side, 
five empty rows of chairs faced 
a podium in front of a dark 
window. Slowly, about a dozen 
tentative 
audience 
members 
filtered in — some in pairs but 
many of them alone — careful 
to leave several empty seats 
between each of them. They 
ranged in age, some carrying 
heavy college backpacks and 
some with graying hair. It was 
clear that this was not a sellout 
event, but a quiet and comforting 
appreciation for each other’s 
presence passed from person to 
person.
This strange crew gathered at 
Literati on an overcast Thursday 
evening to listen to author 
Luke Geddes speak about his 
new book “Heart of Junk” as 
part of the bookstore’s “Fiction 
at 
Literati” 
series. 
Geddes 
himself fit right into the shy yet 
distinctly eccentric atmosphere 
of the coffee shop. With his 
round glasses, brightly striped 
sweater and white tennis shoes, 
he could easily be mistaken for a 
college freshman. However, his 
genuine, steady passion for the 
world he created in his book was 
undeniable, even if a little timid.
The novel, while technically 
a comedic mystery involving 
a kidnapping and a pageant 

queen, centers around antique 
malls and extreme collectors 
in the middle of America. The 
conversation at Literati lingered 
on the “junker mindset” and the 
unique community found while 
haunting vintage shops. When 
asked by moderator and fellow 
novelist 
Michael 
Zadoorian 
about his knowledge of these 
subjects, Geddes spoke from 
personal experience; stifling a 
laugh, he described his awkward 
encounters at second-hand stores 
and antique malls. At one point 
he explained that he rarely talks 
to people on his research trips 
and instead prefers to eavesdrop 
on the veteran collectors or let 
his wife haggle with the cashiers. 
These comments seemed so 
insanely in line with his quiet 
and slightly offbeat demeanor it 
was almost comical.
Geddes’ 
writing 
style 
further 
contributed 
to 
his 
unconventional image. His book 
opens with an advertisement 
for a roommate on craigslist. In 
his characteristic understated 
humor, he writes: “I cannot have 
anybody touching or moving 
my stuff because it would set 
off a chain reaction of emotions 
and feelings towards you and 
towards my things. Hoarding 
is not a mental illness, it is 
something 
environmentally 
responsible because I don’t like 
to throw things away. But the 
Department of Public Health 
said my living conditions were 
unsafe and came in and forcibly 
removed my things I have been 
collecting for over 40 years. It 
traumatized me and I have been 
rebuilding my collection ever 
since.”
Another topic touched on 
was what Zadoorian termed 
the depressing nature of estate 

sales. Here Geddes started to 
get at his central argument that 
material objects can represent 
or even replace life experiences. 
He described the bizarre feeling 
of picking through an entire 
life compressed into a room or 
a house and explained how he 
tried to translate this idea to his 
book. With this thought in mind, 
he presented the audience with 
the question of what it means 
to take someone’s objects after 
they’re gone. 
While 
Geddes 
provided 

his nervous charm, the cast 
of characters in the audience 
brought its own entertaining 
personalities. Sitting alone on 
the side was a young man with a 
small collection: a stack of books, 
some written by the author 
and some by the interviewer. 
Whether an aspiring new writer 
or just a fellow connoisseur of 
strange objects, it was clear 
this guy had done his research. 
Prepared with his books and 
a pen for signing, the boy on 
the side chuckled in agreement 

when Zadoorian mentioned a 
specific hard-to-come-by album 
apparently only found in the 
dustiest, most secret record 
stores and the dreams of die-
hard collectors.
In the front row sat two older 
women clad in wool and polka-
dots, both clutching their brand-
new copies of Geddes’ book. 
When Geddes was asked about 
his research on the more obscure 
collector’s items, such as antique 
glass and postcards, these two 
perked up. They nodded along 

at Geddes’ description of the 
mature crowds that he found at 
antique conventions, exchanging 
knowing looks and seasoned 
smiles. 
After the event ended with 
several questions and a line for 
Geddes’ signature, the audience 
members drifted down the stairs 
to the cash register to purchase 
“Heart of Junk.” I left with the 
warm thought that for that last 
hour I’d been allowed take part 
of in such a small collection of 
intriguing and peculiar people.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The store where I work is 
getting these new shirts in stock 
for the spring (I promise this isn’t 
a plug). 
I’m 
deeply 
excited 
about 
them, partly because I haven’t 
seen them in person and I want 
the swift rush of dopamine that 
comes with showcasing a product 
that really stands on its own. And 
partly, because I’m afflicted with 
a feverish interest in anything that 
brings to mind the work of Giotto 
and Hieronymous Bosch — not 
to say that Medieval, Early and 
post-Renaissance depictions of 
European Catholic mysticism are 
even close to the entirety of what’s 
at play. Dubbed by Max Grobe at 
Highsnobiety as makers of “the 
occult alternative to your favorite 
Hawaiian shirt,” Endless Joy is 
the brainchild of designer Stevie 
Anderson, whose creations are 
“instilled with cryptic symbology 
and the subversive artworks play 
host to a motley crew of deities, 
shamans & spirits engaged in 
a dialectic of complementary 
opposites.” 
On its website, the brand 
normally goes out of its way to 
explain the source of inspiration for 
the artwork. From my perspective, 
Anderson has managed to create 
a 
visual 
language 
of 
global 
mysticism without coming from 
a 
Westernizing, 
colonizing, 
exoticizing 
or 
otherwise 
problematic 
positionality. 
Anderson does not directly take 
from different cultures, but rather 
envisions ways in which belief 
systems might intersect without 
valuing one over the other, and 
also goes out of his way to explain 
the histories from which his 
inspiration comes. 

Iterations of his philosophy like 
the Paradise Lost shirt eschews the 
assumption of a classical rendering 
of the primordial fall from grace 
that the John Milton-indebted 
name might entail. A classic camp 
collar shirt, fashioned out of 
ecologically sourced Indonesian 
silk and mother-of-pearl buttons, 
affords an atmospheric canvas 
filled with skies of deep lapis, 

palm trees that at once look tall 
and thin and muted and wilting 
and beaming with energy, sugilite-
hued fruits that adorn them and 
a ground filled with what looks 
like translucent hair.The ground 
comes up around and brushes 
against the feet of two opposing 
figures, each occupying one side of 
the shirt’s two front-facing panels. 
The identity of the figures, vastly 
different in their appearance, is 

quite open to interpretation. 
However, the shirt in question 
just 
isn’t, 
really. 
The 
two 
aforementioned figures appear to 
come from late-medieval and early-
Italian-Renaissance depictions of 
both deities and anthropomorphic 
figures of the afterlife envisioned 
by artists like Giotto di Bondone 
through Catholic and aristocratic 
patronage. To the left is a humanoid 

rabbit woman, wearing a goddess-
like, one shoulder coral dress out of 
organza or tulle, donning perked 
up ears, wide eyes and a modest 
grin as she exalts a blue python 
snake that’s wrapped around her 
arms. To the right of this scene 
is a woman completely cloaked 
in a white, form-fitting, jersey-
like material with exaggerated 
goddess sleeves and a high slit 
starting at the right hip. She holds 

a tall, lit candle and maintains a 
friendly posture that welcomes 
you into this new environment. 
That same woman is mirrored on 
the back of the shirt, with the same 
friendly posture and slight smile 
that’s visible even through her 
cloak. To her right is a humanoid 
man with the head of a goat. He 
wears a loincloth out of that same 
white jersey fabric, his hands and 
fingers are splayed and slightly 
stretched out to his sides and his 
renaissance-like 
contrapposto 
is directed elsewhere. He seems 
curious, but not with any respect 
to the viewer that’s now being 
welcomed in from both sides of 
this wearable canvas. The symbols 
in this work are extensive. A 
cloaked woman, a candle, and the 
sexualization of what appears to 
be religious attire and its fusion 
with references to Roman statues 
and idealized nudes. The nods to 

Greek mythology, biblical texts, 
and to the kinds of creatures that 
are often exaggerated and made to 
be unsettling depictions of what 
might exist in canonized versions 
of hell. The luxuriously deep blue, 
suggesting both night and a kind 
of otherworldly environment, and 
the ties to nature that are altered 
just enough to toe the line between 
reality and fantasy. These all 
present more questions than they 
do answers. The sum of the shirt’s 
parts don’t necessarily add up to 
anything, and they certainly don’t 
have to be read into this deeply, but 
they do draw on familiar visual 
narratives in order to present 
something new. 
In a short description, the brand 
states that “beneath the electric-
spirit of the acid-lit palm, swinging 
in the blue night & surrounded by 
stars… emerge the archetypes.” 
Followed by the quote from famed 

psychologist Carl Gustav Jung, 
“Man has developed consciousness 
slowly and laboriously, in a process 
that took untold ages to reach the 
civilised state. And this evolution 
is far from complete, for large 
areas of the human mind are still 
shrouded in darkness.” What are 
these archetypes? Is this scene a 
depiction of Heaven? Hell? If not, 
then where might we be? If this 
environment isn’t based entirely 
in an ideology that’s been laid out 
for us, then how can we go about 
understanding it? In what could 
be argued as one of the brand’s 
more 
visually 
straightforward 
garments, Anderson calls on the 
consumer and viewer alike to 
challenge their notions of the 
supernatural, the afterlife and 
how they might apply to the 
frameworks through which we 
view culture in a broad sense as 
well as in our everyday lives.

from grace that the John Milton-
indebted name might entail

When I find a song to share 
with my mom, I always wait 
until it’s the two of us in the car. 
It would be difficult to trace how 
many of our shared obsessions 
began with this exact scene, but 
I imagine the fugitivity of the 
moment and ourselves on the 
road — minds and bodies alike — 
are somehow linked.
It’s something to do with not 
having to watch her face if I don’t 
want to, which is something to do 
with fear of finding disinterest 
in it, which is something to do 
with how absurdly high stakes 
these transactions feel to me. It 
doesn’t make me feel like I’m in 
the crosshairs; instead, it calls 
my understanding of the person 
sitting beside me into question.
A folk cover of a Nirvana song 
played between those seats, as 
did my mom’s first contemporary 
hip-hop record, as did the song 
that initiated our (neverending) 
Solange phase. Once, on a night 
drive during my new wave spurt, 
I queued a sequence that started 
with The Replacements’ “I Will 
Dare,” probably included a Cars 
song I thought she might be able 
to pretend wasn’t the Cars (Dad 
loves, Mom hates), definitely 
included Echo & the Bunnymen 
and concluded with Iggy Pop. 
She told me she hadn’t listened to 
those songs since she was around 
my age, commuting to college at 
U-M Dearborn. 
Those moments, identifying, 
then translating across a synapse 
I 
hadn’t 
detected, 
are 
the 
ones I wait for. The ones that 
compensate for the face she made 
when, say, I tried to convince her 
Bob Dylan could sing.
***
I don’t know if I should be 
writing about this. I wasn’t there 
to see how it began: with the 
artful labor of creating a mixtape. 
I’ve never had a cassette slipped 
into my hands, never consulted 
someone’s 
carefully 
printed, 
cryptic title to gather a hint as to 
what I might hear. 
I’ve come of age in the days 
of Spotify and other digital 
streaming services. I don’t tend 
to look at the past in a way that 
lends itself to longing, so I quickly 

adapted 
to 
an 
increasingly 
intangible 
experience 
with 
music. Even after admiring box 
after box of vinyl, I rarely make 
purchases at the record stores 
I visit, and I don’t miss the 
choreography of extracting a CD 
without leaving fingerprints on 
it. Does that mean that I have no 
taste of that old-school magic?
I don’t think so. I think when 
I pull up the Spotify playlist I 
commissioned from a friend after 
hearing his favorite Kendrick 
Lamar song by chance and finally 
admitting that I had neglected a 
revolutionary genre for too long, 
I know something of its charms. 
I don’t think that because the 
songs on the digital counterpart 
of a mixtape were easier to 
compile that less attention and 
care were devoted to the act of 
compiling them. I don’t think 
that kind of transaction will ever 
depreciate if music is still part of 
it.
***
I’ve begun to confuse the 
absence of a person with the 
absence of their music. I’ve 
begun to confuse the presence 
of a person with the sound of 
their music. I’ll give you an 
example: It’s not when I visit the 
house where my Pa once lived 
that I perceive his absence most 
clearly. That might proceed in 
part from my Nana’s refusal to 
move anywhere else and curator-
like preservation of the home 
they once shared. Regardless, it’s 
when I listen to a song and think, 
I know exactly who would love 
this song, and that person is him, 
and the music sharing comes to a 
sad, jolting halt that I know what 
it means for him to be gone.
It 
got 
worse 
when 
my 
Grandma Laura died. Unlike my 
Pa’s heart attack, her death was 
anticipated, 
slowly, 
painfully 
ambled toward. At one point, 
she gathered her grandchildren 
around her chair and presented 
us with paper butterflies, glued 
to adjustable clips so that we 
could attach it to something. 
It was supposed to be her way 
of being with us, even as her 
mobility slipped away. I cried in 
the bathroom: Because of what it 
meant, I both wanted and didn’t 
want it in the most severe way.
Six years after her death, in 
the process of moving in and 

out of college dorms, I lost the 
butterfly. One of the most fragile, 
most important belongings I 
have ever had, and ever will 
have. Telling my mom was much 
more 
shameful, 
much 
more 
distressing than any Catholic 
sacrament I had ever been forced 
to participate in. How could my 
grandmother ever be present 
if I lost the object in which she 
vested that presence?
I don’t know, but I can tell you 
that I turned to music.
“Paper Butterfly,” I titled it. 
The caption adds, “favorite songs 
of and songs inspired by the 
favorite songs of my grandma, 
Laura Leigh Schmidt (1948-
2012).” It’s a playlist on Spotify, 
with a foundation of Paul Simon 
and Queen (her favorites), a few 
songs of special significance 
interspersed (Elton John’s “Your 
Song”: the song my mom told me 
my uncle and Grandma Laura 
danced to at his wedding) and, of 
course, songs I wish I could play 
for her. Yusuf’s “If You Want to 
Sing Out, Sing Out.” Paul Simon’s 
not the only one with the voice 
of an angel. Grace Potter & The 
Nocturnals’s “Stars.” I can’t 
look at the stars / They make me 
wonder where you are. Aretha 
Franklin’s “You Make Me Feel 
Like a Natural Woman.” Tell me 
what that feels like.
That’s more than translating 
across a synapse. It’s the letter 
I’ll never send because I can’t. 
It’s a language for grief, a less 
painful iteration of the imagined 
conversation, where at least 
the silence, still impervious, is 
disturbed.

***
So I’m confessing once and for 
all: I’m your Spotify stalker.
I can’t tell you how many 
essays and sorrows and long 
nights 
your 
playlists 
and 
inadvertent 
recommendations 
have gotten me through, so what 
I should say next is thank you.
Thank you for luring me into 
the worlds of dream pop and 
contemporary R&B, worlds I’m 
not sure I could have found the 
entrance to without you.
Thank you for dismantling 
the concept of “guilty pleasure,” 
for listening publicly, so I can 
also listen publicly to songs 
I worshipped in ninth grade, 

when I need them to remind me 
of what that time felt like.
And no, I’m not proud of this 
one, but thank you for showing 
me you’re alive when sometimes 
I wonder. When I haven’t heard 
from you in a few days, sometimes 
I stakeout the “Friend Activity” 
sidebar. Then I’ll see your name 
and your song and the speaker 
with 
the 
arcs 
representing 
sound, and I exhale. You’re okay. 
It’s post-punk, so you’re probably 
not happy. But the music is on, 
so you are alright. In adequate 
hands, for now.
***
I’ve used playlists as the 
language 
of 
my 
grief, 
so, 
naturally, I’ve also used them 
to try to make legible fleeting, 
off-mark feelings that could 
have thickened into something 
like love. “Could have” because 
I 
should 
preface 
this 
with 
another confession, that I forgot 
how the story goes. It was the 
same promising, blinding boy-
meets-girl, followed by the same 
violation 
of 
boundaries, 
the 
levying of power dynamics, for 
which boy expresses guilt and 
girl comforts boy. (Who comforts 
girl?)
But between points A and 
B of course, there was music. 
There were songs that said, I’m 
trying to figure out my feelings 
for you. There were careful 
recommendations that said, You 
might understand this, even 
though no one else has. The 
songs added up in our minds 
and told us what we wanted to 
believe about one another. For 
me, that was that I found a man 
who wasn’t just luring me in with 
feigned respect for boundaries 
and limits, who wouldn’t take 
advantage. (I was wrong.) For 
him, it seemed something more 
like I was the antidote to some 
part of himself, with involuntary 
powers of healing. (He was 
wrong, too.)
These 
song 
statements 
and 
misrepresentations 
were 
housed in Spotify’s collaborative 
playlist function. We had two 
of 
them; 
especially 
in 
the 
beginning, I would contemplate 
my contribution obsessively. I 
tried to calculate all the ways it 
could misfire, both in terms of 
whether he would actually like 
it and whether it would say what 

I wanted it to say. And I would 
wait for his response song, check 
the playlists obsessively, listen 
the moment he added something. 
 
One day, close to the end, at 
a time where I was somewhere 
between wanting to see him often 
and feeling like I was supposed 
to want to see him often, I was 
walking to work. It was cold 
and I’d forgotten the earmuffs 
he’d once complimented. To 
make matters worse, my hair 
was pulled back, so the wind 
gnawed mercilessly at both ears. 
I inserted an earbud in each, 
numbness still blossoming, and 
queued the most recent songs he 
added to one of the playlists. 

One was about finding a 
reason to live in another person, 
which he had promised I wasn’t, 
that he wouldn’t let one person 
be that, but the song still had 
warmth. Another was about a 
couple’s atypical, wonderfully 
awkward track to falling in love. 
I felt a flood of warmth, starting 
with my ears. His songs playing 
in them, their lyrics I figured 
might as well be his words, 
warmed me from the inside 
out, swirled around my head, 
dizzying, almost fashioning a 
pair of earmuffs out of thin air 
and a few well-sung notes.
After the boundary violation, 
I grew resentful of his music. I 
didn’t look forward to adding 
songs to our playlists anymore; 
when I did, it was perfunctory 
and begrudging. I shuddered 
when I saw him listening to 

a song I’d recommended or 
whenever his name displayed on 
my “Friend Activity” (“friend,” 
the word I questioned). When I 
realized how not only permissible 
but also how simple it would be 
to escape this dimension of his 
lingering, it was ridiculously 
liberating. How unburdening it 
was to unfollow the playlists, to 
delete the one I made for him and 
lastly to unfollow him.
It’s unnerving how still, when 
I listen to a song by an artist he 
liked and I once liked, it carries a 
new weight of having been part of 
a trust I developed with someone 
but deeply regret. Maybe it’s that 
we surrender pieces of ourselves 
to our songs, the transaction, 
the dialogue that they are. We 
must because the associations 
between a person and their 
music is wonderful sometimes, 
unbearable 
other 
times 
and 
always incontrovertible.
We must, because getting 
free from him and getting free 
from his music felt like the same, 
almost possible, depriving but 
necessary thing.
***
It used to make me sad, how 
integral music or really any form 
of media can be to some of my 
relationships. I thought of it as 
the mark of a fizzling connection, 
like the unintelligible audio that 
occasionally 
bursts 
through 
static as you drive away from the 
tower.
Now I’m not so sure. What 
if, instead, it was the strongest 
connection 
we 
could 
have 
among ourselves? What if it’s the 
cables buried deep, the ones that 
survive the storms and are there 
even after the soil and pollution 
are piled on top?
My favorite line of poetry 
comes from a sam sax poem 
called “bury.” In it, sax entertains 
his fascination with burial rites, 
concluding with his own such 
preferences: “when I’m gone, 
make me again / from my hair. 
carry me with you / a small book 
in your pocket.”
When it comes down to it, I 
think I see music in a related, 
baseline way.
When I’m gone, remember 
me by my songs. Make a playlist 
in my name; I’ll be there, 
somewhere, probably in between 
the minor chords.
