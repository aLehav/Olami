PLAYING UNDER THE STARS

Headquarters in
* Lansing will be
hub for research in

By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
LANSING - Michigan's Uni-
versity Research Corridor, a col-
laboration of the University of
Michigan, Michigan State Univer-
sity and Wayne State University
officially opened its headquarters
here Friday afternoon.
Created in 2007, the URC was
formed to foster cooperation and
combine resources between the
three research universities in
order to help strengthen the state's
economy.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, MSU President Lou
Anna K. Simon and Wayne State
University President Jay Noren
attended the event. Each president
spoke passionately about the URC
and outlined their goals for the
consortium.
Coleman said collaborations
between the three universities
in the state will ultimately help

Michigan's economy and future,
adding that the partnerships
extend throughout all levels of the
universities.
"That's deeplysatisfyingbecause
I firmly believe that we will all rise,
we will all challenge each other to
be better as we are collaboratingto
help the state," Coleman said. "We
clearly understand that our future
is deeply connected with the state's
future. We believe that we can be
a positive force for change and we
want to do that."
Jeff Mason, executive director
of the URC, said the consortium
was established in order to bring
the research occurring at each of
the three universities together to
help facilitate growth in Michi-
gan's economy.
"For every company expanding
or locating to Michigan, there were
companies that were contracting
or, at worse, closing," Mason said.
He explained that expanding
companies in the state are in sec-
tors like information technology,
life sciences, advanced manufac-
turing and alternative energy. He
added that the universities have a

Officials: Betsy Barbour dining
hail willremain open next year

Housing will look
elsewhere to cut
costs, Logan says
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
After much protest from
residents, University Housing

announced Saturday that the din-
ing hall in the Betsy Barbour Resi-
dence Hall will remain operational
for the 2010-2011 academic year.
At a meeting with Betsy Bar-
bour and Helen Newberry resi-
dents last week, University officials
discussed closing the dining hall
in an effort to cut down on costs.
If the dining hall closed, Hous-
ing said residents could eat in the

North Quad Residence Hall that is
scheduled to open next fall on East
Washington Street.
But on Saturday, Linda New-
man, director of University Hous-
ing, sent an e-mail to all Barbour
and Newberry residents announc-
ing plans to keep the dining hall
open. Newman wrote in the e-mail
that the meeting held last Wednes-
day between Housing officials and

residents influenced Housing's
decision.
"The earnest views of the Bar-
bour/Newberry community have
persuaded us to continue to pro-
vide meal service at Betsy Barbour
Hall next year," Newman wrote in
the e-mail.

Peter Logan said in an interview

While Ann Arbor firefighters
of Local 693 respond to fire emer-
gencies on campus, the Univer-
sity doesn't plan to extend further
financial support to the depart-
ment, which is facing severe bud-

get cuts.
Last month, Ann Arbor fire-
fighters postponed potential lay-
offs by taking a 4-percent pay cut.
However, the city is now con-
sidering laying off 19 firefighters
when a new contract is set in July.
The changes have the potential to
impact fire safety on campus, and
the fire department may turn to
the University for support.
Though Local 693 is strapped
for funds, University officials say
they will not create a firefighting
unit on campus even though the
University has its ownpolice force.
According to University Police

spokeswoman Diane Brown, the
University created the Department
of Public Safety because city police
were strugglingto respond quickly
to campus calls. In addition, DPS
officers are trained specially to
respond to campus-specific crimes
like residence hall incidents and
large University events.
Unlike DPS officers, University
officials don't believe firefighters
need specialized training to serve
campus. Brown said the five fire
stations in Ann Arbor are located
close to the University and have
had no recent history of delayed

Beanster's Cafe facig money woes

Decline in sales for Borders
could spell big job losses in A2

Official: 18-percent
loss in sales due to
opening of Panera
Bread nearby
By ALEXA BREEDVELD
For the Daily
Beanster's Cafe, located in the
Michigan League, has long been a
popular spot for students to study
during breaks between classes, grab
a quick lunch and chat with friends.

But despite long lines and tables
that are always filled, the caf6 is
reporting an 18-percent decline
in sales for the 2009 fiscal year.
According to Laura Seagram, the
marketing specialist for the Uni-
versity cafes, sales have been down
since Panera Bread opened a block
away from Beanster's on North Uni-
versity Avenue in April last year.
In an effort to set itself apart
from Panera Bread, Seagram said
Beanster's is trying to offer things
the national chain can't, like using
locally grown ingredients and man-
agers who are trained chefs and

baristas.
"These are things we're trying to
do to stand apart ... both marketing-
wise and operationally, to bring in
that audience, to try and compete
with somebody who is a national
brand," Seagram said.
Beanster's Manager Jessica Rob-
erts also said the cafe aims to give
customers something different from
whatcthey can expect from a nation-
al chain.
"Our focus for Beanster's Cafe is
a core menu that is value friendly,

Michigan State University
Athletic , Director Mark Hollis
announced Friday that MSU's new
brand identity program will include
the current Spartan logo - not the
revised one - according to an arti-
cle in The State News.
After an overwhelmingly nega-
tive response from alumni, students
and fans, MSU officials decided to
stay with the current design.
"After careful consideration, we
will use the current Spartan logo
design - first used in the late 1970s
- to build our visual brand identi-
ty," Hollis said in the article.
Hollis added that the brand iden-
tity program will continue its part-
nership with Nike to help create a
consistent and cohesive brand iden-
tity for the university.

Security adviser to GOP: Stop criticizing anti-terror effort

White House under
fire for security
approach after
Christmas Day attack
WASHINGTON (AP) - An
exasperated White House newly
committed to preaching partisan
peace slammed Republicans for
playing politics on national secu-
rity and making ignorant allega-
tions about the investigation into
the Christmas airliner plot.
Deputy national security advis-
er John Brennan complained yes-

terday that politicians, many of
them Republicans, were unfairly
criticizing the administration for
partisan purposes and second-
guessing the case with a "500-
mile screwdriver" that reaches
from Washington to the scene of
the abortive attack in Detroit.
"Quite frankly, I'm tiring of
politicians using national secu-
rity issues such as terrorism as
a political football," Brennan
said. "They are going out there.
They're unknowing of the facts.
And they're making charges and
allegations that are not anchored
in reality."
Brennan's comments on "NBC's

"Meet the Press" came a day after
President Barack Obama urged
Democrats to work with Repub-
licans, telling those attending the
Democratic Party's winter meet-
ing that "we can't solve all of our
problems alone." The president
offered a similar message to a
recent gathering of House Repub-
licans.
Republicans have been par-
ticularly vocal in criticizing the
Obama administration's decision
to charge accused bomber Umar
Farouk Abdulmutallab in crimi-
nal rather than military court
and allowing him tobe advised of
his rights, the so-called Miranda

warning. In contrast to claims
that Abdulmutallab stopped talk-
ing to authorities after receiving
the warning, administration offi-
cials have contended that the sus-
pect provided useful information
before the Miranda warning and
again some weeks later during
further questioning.
Obama himself reiterated his
support for the handling of the
case, telling CBS News in a pre-
Super Bowl interview yesterday
that Abdulmutallab "clammed
up" after authorities had obtained
actionable intelligence from him.
Obama likened the Abdulmutal-
lab case to that of convicted shoe
bomber Richard Reid, whom
Obama said was read his rights
within minutes of his arrest in
December 2001.
"Under the previous admin-
istration, some of the same crit-
ics of our approach have been
employing this policy for years,"
Obama said. However, the presi-
dent added that the policy of read-
ing terror suspects their rights
should be reviewed and suggested
that the best interrogators should
be placed in teams to manne the

process to ensure authorities get
all the information they need.
Brennan said he had person-
ally briefed top GOP lawmakers
on Christmas night about Abdul-
mutallab's arrest and that none
of them raised objections. Those
officials, in response to Bren-
nan, said they were not given any
information beyond the fact of the
arrest.
Brennan said, "There's been
quite a bit of an outcry after
the fact, where again, I'm just
very concerned on behalf of
counterterrorism professionals
throughout our government, that
politicians continue to make this
a political football and are using it
for whatever political or partisan
purposes."
Among those briefed were
Senate Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky.; House Minor-
ity Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio;
and the top Republicans on the
congressional intelligence com-
mittees, Sen. Kit Bond of Mis-
souri and Rep. Pete Hoekstra of
Michigan.
The Republican lawmakers
contended that the nalsteh

received were short on details,
and they remained critical of the
administration's actions.
"Brennan never told me of any
plans to Mirandize the Christmas
Day bomber," Bond said in a state-
ment. "If he had, I would have
told him the administration was
making a mistake."
McConnell spokesman Don
Stewart said in a statement that
Brennan was trying to shift atten-
tion from "bad decisions" that
allowed terrorists in Yemen,
where Abdulmutallab reportedly
received al-Qaida training, to
gain a head start in the wake of
the attack.
"Rather than having highly
trained terror investigators spend
time with this. terrorist, the
administration decided to treat
him as a common criminal who
had a right to a government-fund-
ed lawyer and advised of his right
to remain silent," Stewart said.
Brennan said that Abdulmu-
tallab was treated no differently
than any other terror suspect
arrested on U.S. soil and that the
FBI and others involved in his
arrest acted appropriately.

Detroit Zoo houses
more than 1,000
seized animals
The Detroit Zoo is serving as
a sanctuary to more than 1,000
mammals, reptiles and spiders
seized from a Texas exotic ani-
mal dealer.
The Macomb Daily reports
that the 1,100 animals now at the
Detroit Zoo home were among
nearly 27,000 animals seized
Dec. 15 in the nation's largest
exotic animal rescue effort.
After a judge ruled the ani-
mals will not be returned to
U.S. Global Exotics, Detroit Zoo
employees spent seven weeks
helping care for the animals at a
temporary site in Dallas.
On Thursday, 1,100 of the
" homeless animal were moved to
the Detroit Zoo, including five
wallabies, four sloths and hun-
dreds of reptiles, spiders and
amphibians.
Zoo official Scott Carter says'
zoo workers are now working

Investigators plan to talk
to other pilots to determine
whether they heard any com-

planes just before they collided
in Colorado, killing all three
people on board both planes
while a glider under tow by one
of the aircraft cut loose and flew
to safety.
With no hlackhbox data, inves-

testimony to determine what
led to the fiery crash Saturday,
National Transportation Safety
Board investigator Jennifer
Rodi said yesterday.
The crash occurred asout-
bout 1:30 p.m. Saturday near
the Boulder Municipal Airport
when a southbound Cirrus SR20
collided with a westbound Piper
Pawnee that was towing the
glider, causing the "immediate
disintegration and explosion of

Skier survives
17-hour burial
" beneath avalanche
A skier was buried beneath
an avalanche for 17 hours in the
Swiss Alps before being pulled
from the snow with only mild
hypothermia, police said yes-
terday.
The 21-year-old man
appeared to have survived
because he was trapped next to
a pocket of air that allowed him
to breathe even though he was
unable to free himself from the

crushing weight of the snow,
police in the southern canton of
Valais said.
"I've never heard of such
a case before," said police
spokesman Jean-Marie Bornet.
"It's already very difficult to
survive more than 45 minutes
beneath an avalanche."
The man, who had been ski-
ing alone on an unmarked slope
in the Evolene region about 80
kilometers (50 miles) east of
Geneva, was reported missing
by his family at 4.30 p.m. Satur-
day, police said.

Protests held in
Iraq amid row over

Hundreds of protesters
denounced Iraqis still loyal to
Saddam Hussein's Baath Party
yesterday as tensions soared
over the decision to blacklist
suspected Baathists from next
month's election.
Protesters chanted and car-
ried signs that said, "No, No to
Baath Party!" and "The return
of the Baath Party is a return
to mass graves."
Shiite officials, including
Prime Minister Nouri al-Mali-
ki and his political allies, are
trying to purge all high-level
posts of Iraqis with ties to the
Baath party, which was out-
lawed in Iraq in 2003.

'Historic' snow hits mid-Atlantic

Some areas buried by
more than 2 feet of
snow, thousands left
without power
WASHINGTON (AP) - Planes
were grounded, trains stood still
and Greyhound buses weren't
rolling in the Mid-Atlantic yes-
terday, leaving stranded travelers
wondering when they'll be able to
escape the icy, gray mess created
by a major snowstorm.
'Hundreds of thousands of
homes were without power with
temperatures below freezing all
day, with utilities warning it could
be days before it's all restored.
Plows had scraped down to bare
pavement on some main thorough-
fares while not touching streets
in many areas buried by 2 feet or
more.
In the nation's capital, mean-
while, today will be another day
for residents to get back to normal.
The federal government made the
decision to close agencies today,
and many school districts across
the region were giving students
a snow day. For those stranded,
however, the thought of another
day of weekend wasn't much to
smile about.
Joel Jones of Durham, N.C.,
said he was on a bus from Balti-
more on Friday. When he arrived
in Washington, the rest of the trip
was canceled. He walked to Union
Station to get a train, where he has
remained, sleeping on chairs.
"I'm starting to worry because I
take insulin," said the 41-year-old,
who has diabetes. "I got enough
for like one more shot, so I have

enough until tomorrow. Hopeful-
ly, I'll get on the bus in the morn-
ing."
The National Weather Service
called the storm "historic" and
reported a foot of snow in parts of
Ohio and 2 feet or more in Wash-
ington, Delaware, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. Parts of Virginia,
Maryland and West Virginia got
closer to 3 feet.
Many roads reopened but
officials continued to warn resi-
dents that highways were still
icy, a remnant from the storm
President Barack Obama called
"Snowmageddon."
In Washington, the sun was
finally shining yesterday and the
sounds of shovels could be heard
on streets. In contrast to Satur-
day, when people were frolicking
on the barren streets, thoughts
turned yesterday to cleanup.
The snow snapped tree limbs
onto power lines, and several roofs
collapsed under the weight.
Making matters worse, the
weather service issued a storm
watch for tomorrow.
Some people without electricity
worried whether the power would
return in time for last night's
Super Bowl kickoff - though it
was an afterthought for others just
trying to stay warm.
Julia Nickles-Bryan and her
husband, Charles Bryan, were
more focused on keeping their
twin 7-year-old daughters warm
inside their Baltimore home -
where the thermostat read 47
degrees. All they had for heat was
a gas stove, gas water heater and a
fire in the fireplace.
"We're basically camping,"
Nickles-Bryan said.

ment contractor from San Anto-
nio, Texas, was staying at a hotel
near BWI Airport in Elkridge,
Md., when the snow hit. He had
planned to watch the Super Bowl
with friends in the area, but the
storm made that impossible. He
spent Saturday at a sports bar next
to his hotel and was back for much
of the day yesterday to watch the
game.
"It's a godsend," McKenzie said.
"If this place wasn't here, we'd all
be starving to death."
In Philadelphia, 28.5 inches of
snow fell during the storm, just
shy of the record 30.7 inches dur-
ing the January 1996 blizzard.
Snow totals were even higher to
the west in Pennsylvania, with 31
inches recorded in Upper Stras-

burg and 30'inches in Somerset.
Almost 18 inches was recorded
at Washington's Reagan National
Airport, which had canceled all
flights. That's the fourth-highest
storm total for the city, and airport
officials haven't decided when
flights would resume. At nearby
Dulles International Airport in
Virginia, the record was shattered
with 32 inches. Some flights there
have resumed.
At Reagan National Airport,
59-year-old Gwen Dawkins was
trying to get back to Detroit. She
was supposed to leave yesterday
but still hadn't yesterday after-
noon because of delays and can-
cellations. And she said there was
"no way we're getting out of here
tonight."

"You've got a whole city held
captive here," she said. "They were
very ill-prepared."
Authorities say most public
transportation in Philadelphia has
resumed. In Pittsburgh, bus ser-
vice restarted but light-rail wasn't
running.
In Mount Lebanon, a suburb
south of Pittsburgh, Robb and
Meredith Hartlage were again
trying to clear the sidewalk in
front of their house.
"We did a couple hours yester-
day. I would say about four hours
mixed with sledding," said Robb
Hartlage, 40, who said he's not
too old to play in the snow. He
acknowledged, however, that the
shoveling was hard work.

Obama rallies Dems
amid GOP challenges

Hundreds flee
south Afghan town
ahead of offensive

President to party:
"We can't solve all of
our problems alone"
WASHINGTON (AP) - Just
a year after celebrating Barack
Obama's inauguration, despon-
dent Democrats on Saturday
heard from their party leader
who urged optimism in the face
of Republicans' strong challenge
to their congressional dominance.
The president said politi-
cal leaders must plot their way
forward to November with an
understanding of the economic
difficulties Americans face.
"I understand their frustration.
You understand it as well," Obama
said.
At its winter meeting, a defiant
Democratic Party worked to proj-
ect a message of strength even as
loyalists acknowledged the pros-
pect of several defeats in Novem-
ber. The party that controls the
White House typically loses seats
during midterm elections at an
average rate of 28 net House seats.
President Bill Clinton, the last
Democratic commander in chief,
lost control of Congress in his first
term and Democrats privately are
predicting it could happen again.
Obama, looking to write his
own history, warned fellow Dem-
ocrats that "we have to acknowl-
edge that change can't come
quickly enough."
A government report on Fri-
day put the unemployment rate
at 9.7 percent. Distrust of Wash-
ington has grown and spurred an
anti-Washington sentiment that
sent scores of activists to a "tea
party" convention in Nashville
on the same day. Another sign of
the tone: Republican Sen. Scott
[ -<',I

Brown won a special election to
take the seat of the late, liberal
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Mas-
sachusefts.
Democrats also lost gubernato-
rial contests in Virginia and New
Jersey that had been in Democrat-
ic hands.
Obama sought to energize
Democratic loyalists against what
he called "the other party." He
urged Democrats to work with
their Republican counterparts.
"We can't solve all of our prob-
lems alone," Obama said, as the
audience sat in silence.
While Republicans have stood
in solid opposition to the presi-
dent's proposed overhaul of health
care, Obama insisted he wasn't
willing to abandon the domes-
tic priority that has consumed
months of his agenda and has fall-
en short of victory, for now.
"Let me be clear: Iam not going
to walk away from health care
insurance reform," Obama said,
bringing the audience in the hotel
ballroom to their feet.
Republicans, though, made
clear the Democrats' cur-
rent health proposals must be
scrapped.
"If they get past this arrogant
phase that they have been stuck in
about a year, if they can work their
way past that and concentrate on
the real problem which is the cost,
we are willing to look at it," said
Senate Republican leader Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky. "To work
together, first you have to do iton
a bipartisan basis."
Obama, recognizing his agenda
can't be accomplished without
GOP support, in recent weeks has

been emphasizing the need for
bipartisanship as a way of moving
forward.
'"We can't return t he derelic-
tion of duty," Obama said. "Amer-
ica can't afford to wait, and we
can't look backward."
His party, for certain, would
prefer not to revisit its ordeals of
2009, which produced some vic-
tories but hardly the narrative
that would deliver them electoral
victories this year.
"I know we've gone through
a tough year. But we've gone
through tougher," Obama said.
DNC chairman Tim Kaine, the
former Democratic governor of
Virginia who saw a Republican
follow him into office, insisted
that Democrats should not be
despondent, even if the path for-
ward has become more difficult
following the Massachusetts Sen-
ate election.
"The ghost of Harry Truman
would kill us if he heard us com-
plaining about having only 59
Democratic senators," Kaine said.
Around the room Saturday at
the DNC meeting, Democrats
sought to remain upbeat.
"The fight's been tough," said
Alejandra Salinas, the chair of the
Young Democrats of America's
Hispanic caucus. "We might lose
some seats, but we'll pick up new
ones."
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Washington's nonvoting repre-
sentative in the U.S. House, said
Democrats would continue to
keep up the fight.
"They underestimated us four
yearsago when we took back the
Congress," she said.

Civilians leave area
controlled by Taliban
as militants dig in
KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
(AP) - Minivans piled high with
mattresses and clothing lined up
at checkpoints last as hundreds of
civilians fled a Taliban-controlled
area ahead of a planned NATO
offensive in southern Afghanistan.
The militants, meanwhile, dug
in for a fight, reinforcing their
positions with rocket-propelled
grenades and heavy weapons,
accordingto witnesses.
The U.S. military has not given
a start date for the operation to
clear insurgents from the Helmand
province town of Marjah, the big-
gest community in the south under
insurgent control. But the military
has said fightingwill startsoon and
many residents weren't taking any
chances.
American aircraft dropped leaf-
lets over Marjah yesterday warn-
ing people of the coming offensive,
officers said, and the U.S. fired illu-
mination rounds after sundown,
apparently to help spot Taliban
positions.
Villagers said the leaflets were
aimed primarily at the militants,
listing several of their command-
ers by name and warning fighters
to leave the area or be killed.
U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrys-
tal, the top NATO commander in
Afghanistan, said the success of

the operation depends on convinc-
ing civilians that the government
will improve services once the mili-
tants are gone.
The offensive in Marjah - a
farming community and major
opium-production center with a
population of 80,000 - will be the
first since President Barack Obama
announced he was sending 30,000
additional troops.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai
discussed the on-going operations
in Helmand province ina telephone
conversation yesterday with British
Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a
spokesperson for Brown said.
The spokesperson said they "wel-
comed the leading role" played by
Afghan Security Forces in prepar-
ing for the offensive, stressing that
"Afghan leadership was fundamen-
tal to the success of the operation."
U.S. officials have longtelegraphed
their intention to seize Marjah.
McChrystal said the element of sur-
prise was not as important as letting
citizens know that an Afghan govern-
ment will be there to replace Taliban
overlords and drug traffickers.
"We're trying to create a situa-
tion where we communicate to them
that when the government re-estab-
lishes security, they'll have choices,"
McChrystal told reporters Sunday.
The International Committee of
the Red Cross said there was no way
to count the number of people who
have left Marjah because many have
moved in with relatives or rented
houses in nearby towns instead of
registering for emergency relief.

Silence under orders
The ban on LGBT individuals in the military must end
For years, the U.S. military's infamous "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell" policy has been the focus of much controversy. This
executive order - issued in 1993 under the Clinton admin-
istration - modified full enforcement of a federal law and stated
that members of the LGBT community could serve in the mili-
tary with the caveat that they conceal their sexual preference.
But last week, top military officials addressed Congress in favor
of overturning the ban. The ban on members of the LGBT com-
munity in the military is blatantly discriminatory toward LGBT
people, and actions must be taken by the president and Congress
to end this policy.

I would like to take this opportunity to apologize
from the bottom of my heart for causing many of our
customers concern after the recalls across several
models in several regions."
- Akio Toyoda, the grandson of Toyota's founder speaking at a news
conference, as reported on Friday by Reuters.
An uneven admissions field

Since the beginning of World War II,
federal law has prevented LGBT individu-
als from serving in the military. In order to
get around this policy, former President Bill
Clinton enacted the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
executive order in 1993, allowing gay people
to enlist in the military with the condition
that they concealed their sexual identity. On
Tuesday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Adm. Mike Mullen and Defense Secre-
tary Robert Gates addressed Congress and
called for an end to the law.
The law that banned LGBT people from
the military is clearly discriminatory. Previ-
ous discrimination against African Ameri-
cans in the military was also wrong, and
ending it made the military more cohesive.
And though the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" exec-
utive order aimed to soften the ban, it instead
only masked the discrimination in anonym-
ity. Demanding that an individual conceal
or deny their sexual preference is, plainly,
wrong. Every individual should have the
right to freely express themselves and their
sexual preference. And now that top defense
officials have expressed their dissatisfaction
with the ban, there is no reason it should
remain law.
The ban on members of the LGBT com-
munity serving in the military is simply a
bad, discriminatory law. And it is Congress's
responsibility to put an end to bad laws. Issu-
ing legislation to repeal old laws banning
members of the LGBT community from the
military would end this inequality and be a
progressive step for the United States. Con-

gress should recognize the inherent discrim-
ination of the ban, and overturn it as soon as
possible.
Congress has the power to eliminate the
law, but any sort of Congressional legisla-
tion will probably take months to make
it through the legislative process - the
health care bill debacle has proved that.
In the meantime, President Barack Obama
should act. One of Obama's campaign
promises was to take action against regu-
lations excluding LGBT individuals from
serving in the military. But with a full year
in office behind him, Obama's promise
hasn't been fulfilled.
Though the technicalities of executive
orders are controversial, there is histori-
cal evidence that Obama has the power to
suspend enforcement of the ban, especially
since he controls the executive branch and
is named by the Constitution as the com-
mander in chief of the military. In 1948,
President Harry S. Truman desegregated
the military by executive order. Similarly,
Obama has the opportunity to end a dis-
criminatory policy and it is important that
he takes action. Obama should issue a tem-
porary stop-gap on the enforcement of this
policy, ending further discrimination.
The LGBT community has been dis-
criminated against long enough, and it's
time that they are given equal opportunity
to serve their country. The president and
Congress need to be leaders in the fight for
civil rights and end of the ban on gay people
in the military.

ne of my closest friends has
known she wants to be a doc-
tor since middle school. And
for seven years,
she's done every-
thing by the book
in order to make
that happen.
She spent two a -
and a half years as
a clinical researcher -
for the University,
of Michigan Health
System, scored in COURTNEY
the 95th percentile
on the MCAT and RATKOWA
compiled a GPA
that, even after an
extended illness that affected her abil-
ity to go to class for almost 12 weeks, is
still a 3.73. She received her first accep-
tance letter to a medical school on Oct.
21, well before most of her pre-med
peers. It's safe to say her resume looks
like any medical school's dream.
Well, almost any medical school -
but apparently, not Michigan's.
Her parents have paid taxes in the
state of Michigan her whole life. She
has gone to school in Ann Arbor since
2006 and has contributed to multiple
University research papers in nation-
al journals. But the University of
Michigan Medical School somehow
said "thanks, but no thanks" a few
weeks ago without even granting her
an interview.
Understandably, she's upset she
won't have the chance to attend med-
ical school at the place in which'she's
invested so much for the past four
years. But she's more upset with the
fact that in the last round of inter-
view offers - right before her file was
closed - the University didn't give
more interviews to in-state students.
And after learning a little more about
the school's claim that it "actively
pursues Michigan residents," I can't
help but agree that the, Medical
School's admissions process falls dis-
appointingly short.
It's true that the University of
Michigan Medical School has a
nationally renowned reputation
that's much better than Wayne State

University and Michigan State Uni-
versity, the state's two other medical
schools. That prestige is largely due
to the fact the University admits stu-
dents from all over the country. It's
the same reason why the University's
Ross School of Business is ranked so
high - it, too, attracts students from
all over the country.
But even though that's true, the
University often seems to forget it's
still a public school. And a public
school that's partially supported by
the state - even if that funding cov-
ers a very small -percentage of the
University's annual budget - should
be primarily concerned with educat-
ing the residents of that stated
The University isn't living up to
that. Its in-state interview percentag-
es are simply embarrassing. Accord-
ing to the Medical School Admission
Requirements from the Associa-
tion of American Medical Colleges,
the University interviewed just 181
Michigan residents, compared to 620
non-residents, in 2008. On the other
hand, Michigan State interviewed
323 in-state applicants and 167 out-
of-state applicants, and Wayne State
interviewed 505 residents and 161
non-residents.
And the final admissions numbers
follow the same pattern. Only about
46 percent of University students
who matriculated in the Medical
School in 2008 were actually from
Michigan, far short of the 74 percent
of in-state Michigan State medical
students and 85 percent of in-state
Wayne State medical students.
Medical School Director of Admis-
sions Robert Ruiz explained the dif-
ference by telling me Michigan has a
"different philosophy" than schools
like Michigan State.
"Our mission is simply different -
we educate for the state of Michigan
and beyond," Ruiz said. "It's a philo-
sophical difference. We really do try
to be the leaders and best in terms of
applicants from all over the country."
Ruiz told me that Michigan tries
to aim for a SO-percent in-state medi-
cal student rate each year. That goal
seems to be backed up by the official

Michigan Medical School Admis-
sions Twitter account, which medi-
cal student hopefuls can use to track
Michigan's progress during the
admissions season.
On Jan. 13, eight days before Mich-
igan's last interview date of the sea-
son, the admissions office Tweeted,
"Crunching numbers as we deter-
mine our next and final steps in this
year's file review process. MI resi-
dents a huge part of our current talk."
Four days later, they again said,
"Admission team will meet today at
6:00 p.m. to continue deliberations
on final interview offers with MI res-
idents top priority."
'U' Medical School
is partial to out-of-
state applicants.
But even though the University
claims that's a priority, the numbers
don't lie. A friend who will be attend-
ing the University's Medical School
next year told me that on Jan. 22,
that final interview date, 12 people *
were in-state applicants and 25 were
from outside the state of Michigan.
That doesn't sound like "prioritizing"
in-state applicants to me - and for a
public school, that's inexcusable.
Especially as the University's
available interview spots continued
to decrease this year - Ruiz said the
school offered 661 interviews, down
from 801 in 2008, according to the
AAMC - Michigan residents had
even less of a chance to attend the
public school that's the best in their
state. And even though Michigan says
it wants the "leaders and best" from
across the country, maybe itshould
consider supporting its crumbling
state by educating more of its own.

But is it really such SYED
a crime for a politi-
cian to change his
or her mind upon
years of reflection and added expe-
rience? The case of Harold Ford, Jr.
offers an interesting example.
There's no way to start this column
without first admitting that Ford is a
textbook carpetbagger. That said, one
cannot help but note that Ford - an
alum of the University's law school
- has got some major moxie. It takes
courage to do what he's attempting,
and while he may ultimately fail, his
quest offers unique insights into what
the modern American politician is
and must be, for better and worse.
By now Ford's unique undertaking
is well known. A former conservative
Democratic ("Blue Dog") congress-
man from Tennessee, Ford moved
to New York after his close but ulti-
mately failed 2006 bid to become the
first black senator from the South
since Reconstruction. Since then,
Ford has maintained a public image
by appearing as a commentator on
cable news networks, and he recent-
ly announced that he is considering
challenging Democratic Sen. Kirsten
Gillibrand in the Democratic primary
in New York.
That Ford wants another shot at
the U.S. Senate is hardly a surprise:
He is a bright, well-spoken centrist
who has politics in his blood. He

gave the keynote address at the 2000
Democratic National Convention,
and was supposed to be the party's
young rising star. But circumstance
chose President Barack Obama, leav-
log Ford to contemplate his future in
a party that was suddenly re-situat-
ed further left than was previously
thought appropriate.
It's downright shocking, however,
that Ford would attempt to remake
himself in New York, as unforgiving
a public stage as one could possibly
imagine. While it may be genuine
personal growth and experience that
makes Ford sound so much different
in New York than he did in Tennessee
just a few years ago, that's not some-
thing thatwill go unquestioned in the
media capital of the world. Just weeks
after Ford announced simply that he
was considering a run, the Internet
is abuzz with talk of his Democratic
loyalties - or lack thereof.
Ford admits that he was once
against gay marriage, but says that he
has changed his mind after listening
to the debate for the past few years.
And although his critics accuse him
of being a pro-lifer now flying the
pro-choice flag for political expedi-
ence, Ford points out that he has an
extensive pro-choice record, despite
ads circulating on the web that sug-
gest otherwise. Still, on these and
other issues, it appears there is at
least some degree of political maneu-
vering going on. My question is: Is
that such a bad thing?
Right around the time of the
American Revolution, the British pol-
itician Edmund Burke expounded on
the merits of a representative democ-
racy by stating that a representative
must always be responsive to his con-
stituents. He must keep in mind their
unique needs and be their voice in the
legislature. However, Burke famously
declared that a representative owes
constituents "not his industry only,
but his judgment; and he betrays,

instead of serving you, if he sacrifices
it to your opinion."
According to Burke, our elected
leaders are elected not to do what we
say, but rather to use their judgment
about what is best for us. Should they
fail, we replace them - that is democ-
racy.
Senators should
use judgement, not
popular opinion.
Too often in America today we
elect leaders based on their views
on two or three issues (abortion,
gay marriage, etc.). Politicians must
undergo a meaningless litmus test
before being considered worthy of
getting their party's nomination.
Voters almost never consider during
elections why a candidate supported
one thing or another - we simply dis-
card him upon hearing of an unfavor-
able vote. The result is that the vital
process of vetting based on judgment
that Burke so favored has become
largely non-existent in America.
So - even if we assume the worst
about Ford for a minute - is it really
that bad that one politician is trying
to duck this misguided litmus test?
Tennesseans value different things
than New Yorkers, and it makes per-
fect sense that their representatives
would reflect that difference in val-
ues.
Let's face it: Harold Ford, Jr. would
make a fine senator from New York.
Why should it matter that he would
have made just as fine a senator from
Tennessee?

A singular success

Fashion's Tom Ford makes
his film debut with visuals
as stunning as his clothes
By JENNIFER XU
Daily Arts Writer
Musicians are notorious for failing com-
pletely in their attempts to cross over to act-
ing. Rapper Ice Cube has had
a prolific career starring in
jewels like "Barbershop 2:
Back in Business," "Are We A Single
There Yet?" and "Are We
Done Yet?" Jennifer Lopez Man
had "Gigli." Mariah Carey At the
had "Glitter." Madonna - Michigan
let's not even go there. But ii
when a fashion designer The Weinstein
makes the transition to film,
what happens? The result is
"A Single Man," a startlingly potent portrait of
a gay man on the brink of suicide after his part-
nerunexpectedly dies in a car crash.
It's no surprise that the directorial debut
of Tom Ford,- formerly the, GiMtivei director
for Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent - should
be beautiful. Just look at his sleek line of tai-
lored menswear or his sexually charged com,
mercials for his fragrance YSL L'Homme and
you know this man can produce something
lyrically and visually brilliant. No, the greatest
surprise is that beyond all that surface beauty,
Ford can transform his hauntingly lineated
images and emotions into something that hits

on a primal level.
Oscar-nominated Colin Firth ("Bridget
Jones's Diary") plays George, the single man
depicted in the title. George is an English pro-
fessor in the 1960s whose partner died eight
months ago, trying to live his life out day by
day. Firth's performance is truly a marvel,
managing to break out of the "nice guy" type-
cast perpetuated by years of trite romantic
comedies. It's difficult to portray a character
in these types of "emotion" films, because the
storyline is so slight, and it's to Firth's credit
that he can attach real meaning to the deep
grief his character feels. Within his carefully
composed appearance there is no outlet for
escape, so the wrinkles on his forehead and the
despair in his eyes need to do the work for him.
Across his sunken, furrowed brow are etched a
whole history of emotions - sadness, remem-
brance, hopelessness.
Yet just when the film threatens to sink
into a cesspool of exquisite depression, sal-
vation arrives in the form of Julianne Moore
("Children of Men"). Moore plays Charley,
a boozy 40-something divorcee still in love
with her gay, heartbroken best friend. George,
pays Charley a visit on the eve of his planned
eslifide; adthe result is a swoony; exhilarat-
ing, heartbreaking dream of a scene. The two
spend a night of drunken reminiscence and
hysterical laughter together, then furiously
dance until they pass out on the floor, leaving
two tantalizing trails of smoke behind them.
The film evokes a level of sophistication dif-
ficult to find in any romance, gay or straight.
The delectable few flashbacks to George's boy-
friend Jim (played with delicious bitchiness by

Matthew Goode from "Brideshead Revisited")
are as perfectly tailored as the cut and style of
a crisp, white button-down.
Yet where the strengths truly lie are the
irreplicable images with which Ford leaves us.
The flutter of a young student's winged eye-
lash is juxtaposed against the fuzz of anoth-
er's white angora sweater. Strands of violin
strings weave in and out of the background
while a mass of rippled muscles emerges from
the water. This is the Tom Ford we've come to
expect. This is the Tom Ford who appreciates
the human physique and the power of a melody
to transport the audience to a higher emotion-
al level. Ford never forgets where his roots lie,
liberally drenching his film in the visual and
auditory aesthetic.
But for all his stylistic feats, Ford can get
a little too carried away with his artistry. He
has a tendency to experiment with color tones
- when George is sad, the entire composition
cools down into icy blues and zombie-walking.
It seems to scream, "I am sad!" Yet once any-
thing remotely positive perchances upon his
life, the frame immediately warms up into
sun-flecked silhouettes and candy hues. It's all
just a little bit too dramatic - beautiful, but too
dramatic. But this move can beforgiven;os it's.-
something that can be attributed more to inex-
perience than pretension.
What Ford does exquisitely well is craft a
fine portrait of a man tragically heartbroken.
"A Single Man" is a triumphant, understated
debut from a man who hopefully will go on
to create a masterpiece. While this particular
film isn't quite that masterpiece, it's pretty
damn close.

narios. The idea is that two mas-
sive armies clash over a set of
objectives (fuel stations, vehicles,
communication towers) on a huge
field of battle. Guns are blazing,
enemies are everywhere and
wits and comrades are your only
assets (except for lots and lots of
bullets).
That, at least, is the theory. In
practice there are some nagging,
unfortunate problems that end
up making "MAG" a thoroughly
mediocre and occasionally frus-
trating experience.
There's not much in the way of
story behind "MAG." Set in the
very near future, the world has
been divvied up among three pri-
vate military contractors: S.V.E.R.,
Valor and Raven. Players choose

players) are then assigned to take
command of both and instruct
their underlings to bomb a specific
roadblock or demolish a certain
bunker, all in hopes of achieving
the larger goals for which the sce-
nario calls.

The University of Michigan College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts
presents a public Lecture and reception

UMMA asks students to react

By HEATHER POOLE
DailyArts Writer
In celebration of the upcom-
ing one-year anniversary of the
reopening of the University of
Michigan Museum of Art, a new
student-geared program has been
created. "l Year, Many Voices"
focuses on students' responses to
the museum's collections.
The Student Programming and
Advisory Board of UMMA, in col-
laboration with Arts at Michigan,
is accepting submissions from stu-
dents until Sunday, Feb. 14. The
Board is asking students to create
a response to one piece of art in
the UMMA collection. There is no
restriction on format. The medium
of the submission can range from
photography to music to a written
response.
"We really wanted to open up
the doors to any way that students
would respond," said Mary DeYoe,
education program coordinator
of UMMA. "So it could be musical

said. "This year it's really cool
because it's the first year that they
have a building to work with and
(a chance) to actually create pro-
new museum grams and to help figure out ways
ills for a new to get students involved."
Since the reopening of UMMA,
o r m the Board has become increasingly
focused on the students' reception
of the collection.

publication, depending on the
medium of the selection. There will
also be a ceremony on April 1 to cel-
ebrate all of the submissions.
As for future plans, the Board is
keeping an open mind on the con-
tinuation of the program.
"Right now it's just this year's
project and I think we'll see where
it goes," DeYoe said.
However, DeYoe indicated
one enduring theme in future
programs will be the students'
interaction and involvement with
UMMA.
UMMA offers a stunning col-
lection of work, spanning from
Contemporary and Modern to
African to Early Western art.
Now, in correspondence with
the UMMA motto "the more we
look, the more we feel," students
are able to finally be a part of a
museum that has become a staple
of Ann Arbor.

According to Wenisch, the Uni-

has relationships with many faculty
members in the EECS and other
departments. However, the recent

said, because they have been ear-
marked for specific research fields,
and they consist of larger sums than
usual. Until now, most of Google's
grants have been for less than
$50,000.
Beyond the direct financial sup-
port, a tighter collaborationbetween
the University and Google will also
be established,Wenischsaid.

they're directly involved in the

"By and large those companies
recognized that one of the key advan-
tages of Michigan's location (are) the
students, faculty and research avail-
able at these three world-class uni-
versities," Mason said.
When the URC was first created,
Coleman said that many people
were skeptical of the joint venture.
Despite the fact that the URC expe-
rienced some growing pains, she
said administrators at all three
institutions are fully behind the
consortium and are working hard
to better it. Coleman added that the
University doesn't have to "do it all"
and it can rely on the URC for assis-
tance in research developments.
"We can't do it all," she said. "We
understand we can't do it all. The

yesterday that officials decided to
keep the dining hall open because
residents expressed that it is a very
important factor in unifying their
community.
"We went back and looked at the
impact on the community versus
a potential cost savings of closing
the dining operation," Logan said.
"(We) determined that keeping Bar-
bour dining in place next year was a
much better choice for the benefit of
that community than trying to save
some dollars by closing it."
Logan said the deliberations
about closing the Barbour Dining
Hall were part of Housing's annual
budgetary process. He said closing
the dining hall would have saved
Housing about $400,000.
Because Housing is independent-
ly financed, Logan said a majority
of its operating budget is obtained
via room and board payments. He
added that Housing officials try
to trim the budget every year in
an effort to reduce the amount of
money students need to pay to live
in the residence halls.

focus on what our strengths are."
The presidents all said they want
the URC to be counted among the
ranks of some of the top research
clusters in the country, including
one in Massachusetts that features
Harvard University, Tufts Univer-
sity and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and another in North
Carolina made up of Duke Universi-
ty, the University of North Carolina
andNorthCarolinaStateUniversity.
Though the URC is newer than
most of the other research clusters
around the country, Noren said it is
in a position to succeed.
"We have a very complimentary
set of three institutions that none of
the others have," Noren said.
* He highlighted MSU's agricul-
tural research, Wayne State's urban
research and the University of
Michigan's wide-breadth of studies
in all disciplines.
"When you combine all those
things together we really cover the
bases like none of the other con-
sortia can," Noren said.
"We are looking at a number of
different places within our operating
budget as we prepare recommenda-
tions for room and board next year,"
Logan said. "Barbour dining was one
of those cost efficiency opportuni-
ties that we looked at. We also look
at things like overtime expenditures,
what we can do to trim administra-
tive costs, where we might be able
to consolidate or streamline other
operations within Housing."
But, Logan said it's too early in
the budgetary process to tell what
other Housing services could be cut
instead of closing the Barbour dining
hall orifroomand board rates would
have tobe raised to compensate.
Logan said one of the reasons
a decision on the dining hall's fate
was reached so quickly was because
Housing officialswanted to give stu-
dents time to decide whether they
wanted to return to live in Barbour
or Newberry next year, adding that
the dining hall may have played a
key role in students' decisions.
"We realized the timing had got-
ten to a point where if we couldn't
give them a clear idea whether or
not there would be dining, those res-
idents were placed in an awkward
position as to whether or not they

Another benefit of the URC,
Simon said, is the ability for the
universities to share facilities.
Specifically, Simon said all three
institutions could potentially share
space in the University of Michi-
gan's new North Campus Research
Complex located on North Campus.
"What the Ann Arbor opportu-
nity presents for all of us and for our
faculty and our students is that there
is some legitimate space," Simon
said. "There's also a way it can be a
part of this team and to take a Mich-
igan State idea that needs lab space,
and it can go there and flourish, and
it's all for our collective good."
Coleman said in an interview after
the meeting that the NCRC will be
used as another resource to deepen
connections within the URC.
"The fact that we are working
together through the URC creates
another opportunity for collabora-
tions to develop that might utilize
the space of the NCRC," Coleman
said, "and it's an example of future
potential that we have."
would really want to return there,"
Logan said.
Barbour residents were relieved
their beloved dining hall would
remain open next year. Signs were
posted on doors throughout halls
urging neighbors to e-mail Hous-
ing encouraging officials to keep the
dining hall open.
LSAsophomore Amy Richardson,
a Barbour resident, said maintain-
ing dining facilities was "extremely
important"to the residents.
"I think it just proves how close-
knit this community is and how
much of an effort they put in to save
thesekinds of institutions," she said.
"You see these things on the door.
Someone went around and put these
all up just to get people more moti-
vated. I guess it worked."
LSA sophomore Jennifer Lamp-
ton, another Barbour resident, said
she would hopefully be living in
North Quad next year, but would
return daily to eat at the Barbour
dining hall anyway.
"It's a great place where you
can meet a lot of people within the
dorm," she said. "I know a lot of
people who even live on North Cam-
pus who eathere everyday. It'sreally
homey."

"And then the talent agent says, 'Nicolas Cage is a really good actor.' "
Cage goes cra y

'Bad Lieutenant' remake
reiterates Herzog's
talent for dark humor
By ANDREW LAPIN
Senior Arts Editor
There's something admirable in the
way Nicolas Cage just goes balls-to-the-
wall insane in every single one ofhis roles
today (his vocal
work in "Astro *
Boy" possibly being
the lone excep- Bad Lieutenant
tion). Cage hasn't
let critical derision Port of Call
or audience apa- New Orleans
thy affect his act-
ing decisions, even At the Michigan
though those deci- First Look
sions led hinn to
star in "Knowing."
Clearly, the inimitable Werner Herzog,
director of such man-on-the-brink films
as "Fitzcarraldo" and "Grizzly Man," saw
something he admired in Cage's ability to
bring the crazy to mainstream cinema..
And this must have been what led him to
cast Cage in his in-name-only remake of
Abel Ferrara's 1992 anti-establishment
cop movie "Bad Lieutenant."
Ilere's a nifty sleight-of-hand this
filn pulls before our very eyes: With its
sweeping shots of a ravaged, post-Katrina
New Orleans and a seemingly hard-boiled

murder mystery, this new "Bad Lieuten-
ant" walks and talks like a mainstream
police drama. But by the time Cage's Ter-
ence McDonagh is hallucinating igua-
nas and cutting off an old lady's oxygen
supply, you'll know the film is anything
but mainstream. This stuff makes "The
Departed" look like "Kindergarten Cop."
Herzog and screenwriter William Fin-
kelstein (TV's "NYPD Blue") are careful
to include only as much plot as is neces-
sary to keep adding fuel to Cage's luna-
cy. The opening scene finds McDonagh
uncharacteristically risking his life to
save a drowning victim. He spends the
rest of the film paying for this random
act of kindness with insufferable back
pain that gives him an addiction to Vico-
din. After his promotion to lieutenant,
McDonagh takes on an investigation into
the murders of five Senegalese refugees
and secures drugs from perps on the side
to both pay off his gambling debts and
share with his prostitute girlfriend (Eva
Mendes, "The Spirit").
This isn't one of those movies in which
we're helplessly watching a straight-and-
narrow guy spin his life out of control
as he succumbs to the evils of addiction.
Herzog is too dismissive of human nature
to make a film about a downward spiral;
to him, everyone is already at the bottom,,
spiraling in place. Neither he nor Cage
is interested in creating a drug addict
the audience will feel sorry for. So we
see McDonagh ingest the highest-grade
cocaine, let off crack-possessing girls on

the street in exchange for sexual favors
and light up a blunt in front of a prime
suspect (but not without offering him a
hit, of course).
There's nothing redeeming in
McDonagh except the unrestrained
glee he takes from getting away with it
all. And we're laughing right along with
him. Here, at last, is a worthy successor
to "Scarface," and when McDonagh com-
mands a stooge to keep riddling a dead
drug lord with bullets because "his soul
still dances," it's an instantly iconic scene
that begs to be quoted a la "Say hello to
my little friend!"
But for such a dark comedy of excess,
it's surprising that the film ends with
something approaching restraint. The
closing shots are more optimistic about
the futures of McDonagh and the sins of
humanity than a film directed by Herzog
has any right to be. Is this - pardon the
pun - a cop-out? A result of pressure
from the studio? An admission by Her-
zog that he can't even maintain inter-
est long enough to properly finish his
vision? Whatever it is, the ending pulls
off another muddling sleight-of-hand on
the viewer.
One thing's for sure: Now that Cage
has restored some of his reputation by
getting a better director to film his bug-
eyed antics, he's free to keep up his reign
of insanity through another batch of bad
movies. That is, once he's settled all of his
recent lawsuits. Hey Cage, a birdie says
there's money in New Orleans real estate.

I'11 admit that I was one of those
people annoyed to see "The Blind
Side" among the Best Picture con-
tenders when the Oscar nominations were
announced last week.
And I'll also admit I had
many other issues with
this year's Oscars, from
Sandra Bullock's inclu-
sion to the Academy's
decision to expand the
supposedly most pres-
tigious categoryto ten ANDREW
movies. There's an audio LApIN
recording of my col-
leagues and I on The Michigan Daily's web-
site that can attest to these feelings.
But since that recording I've been ask-
ing myself: Why all the snark and con-
tempt? Maybe I just geta guilt complex
when I rant about my favorite pastime.
I was furious that "The Reader" robbed
"The Dark Knight" of its spot last year. But
looking back on that a year later, it seems
ridiculous to get so worked up over the
"lack of love" for a movie that grossed over
$500 million in the United States alone. I
have a feeling we'll be doing some similar
soul-searching around this time next year,
and I hope we realize that our love for the
movies shouldn't be dependent on whether
a bunch of old fogies in Los Angeles share
our opinions.
I'll let you guys in on a little secret: I
liked "Crash." And "Juno." And "Slumdog
Millionaire" and "The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button." I don't think the Acad-
emy was wrong to nominate any of them,
despite the backlash they all faced sooner
or later. At one point or another, maybe you
felt that way too.
The movies themselves haven't changed
since they were first released with zero
awards to their name. For the most part,
our perceptions of these movies only
change once the studios in charge of them
(read: not the filmmakers themselves)
decide to spend lots of money and go all
Max Bialystock on little-old-lady Acad-
emy voters. And just as these voters can
be swept onto a film's bandwagon with a
couple of well-timed cocktail parties, so
too can us filmgoers be swept away by an
anti-Oscar mindset.
We like to sit around and talk about
how irrelevant the Oscars have become,
as though we'd know exactly how to make
them relevant if the Academy would only
give us complete free reign of the awards
process. We don't know. If you think you
know, you're wrong: You know only how to
make the Oscars relevant to you.
The Oscars are now just as relevant as
they've always been; they mean something
to those who enjoyed the nominated films,
just like every year. They're a nice little
capper to the annual film cycle. Sometimes

the people you like get to take home little
gold men. Sometimes they don't. Then the
cycle begins anew. But if Oscar didn't mean
anything, these debates wouldn't even
happen anymore. The fact that we still get
worked up over the inclusion of movies like
"The Blind Side" automatically proves the
validity of the ceremony, as opposed to,
say, the collective shrug of the public when
"The Hangover" won Best Comedy at the
Golden Globes.
Am I sucking all the fun out of the tried-
and-true art form known as bitching and
moaning (of which I am a master)? Look,
if you want to walk up to people looking
forward to the Oscars and tell them they're
wrong, that the ceremony's credibility has
gone completely out the window and that
the only way the Oscars can redeem them-
selves is by bludgeoning Sandra Bullock to
death on live TV, go ahead. But I think it
would be better for all of usinvolved, film
fanatics and casual audiences alike, to sim-
ply treat the ceremony as great entertain-
ment and nothing more. We'll all be alot
happier that way.
Ten Best Picture
nominations may not
be so bad after all.
"Great entertainment" isn't the same
thing as saying the Oscars are meaning-
less. The AFI Awards are meaningless.
The Oscars are the glue that holds the
art of filmmakingtogether, which isn't as
bold of a claim as you might think. Studios
bankroll the production of quality movies
like "Up in the Air" in the hopes of win-
ning Oscars, and when you take away that
prize potential, you're left with lowest-
common-denominator panderers instead
of legitimate works of art. Again, movies
can exist as thought-provoking produc-
tions outside of the realm of the Oscars,
and the ceremony itself can exist as a night
of glittery indulgence without the films
themselves. But you need both elements to
keep the film industry alive.
So let's all put aside our differences and
take the pre-Oscars opportunity to actu-
ally do what this ceremony was designed to
have us do: see some movies. Because at the
very least America has now been given 1
new movie recommendations instead of just
five, and if you want to follow Hollywood
enough to debate awards, you owe it to
yourself to see as many of those as you can.

MAG
From Page 5A
In this aspect, the managing
of objectives and the teamwork
those objectives require, "MAG" is
almost brilliant When you have a
disciplined, organized squad with
a competent squad leader direct-
ing players toward challenging
but achievable goals, "MAG" is
a blast. There's nothing else out
there quite like it; the teamwork
necessary to get anything done in
the more advanced scenarios cre-
ates an atmosphere of camaraderie
rarely seen in video games. Sure,
there are plenty of two to four
player co-op games out there, but
to feel like you're working in sync
with more than 100 other players

is really, really cool. The defeats
are more bitter, and the victories
much, much sweeter, accented by
the hoots and hollers of your fel-
low soldiers.
Unfortunately, matches that
actually demonstrate that kind of
teamwork and organization are
painfully rare. Far more common
are 100 to 200 lone wolves, killing
the first thing they see and getting
killed immediately afterward. And
having to re-spawn back into the
game after death is no picnic; there
can be up to a 30-second delay and
there's a good chance the player
will start on the far reaches of the
map, sometimes a full minute or
more away from any action. That
may not seem like a lot, but try
spending 12 minutes of a 30-minute
game waiting to actually play the
game. It's no fun.

And that's not the biggest prob-
lem. This first-person shooter's
flaw is that the first-person shoot-
ing just isn't that fun. The controls
are clumsy, the aiming feels awk-
ward and the weapons are dull.
The character customization tries
to address some of these problems
with perks for leveling up, but even
after hours and hours of gameplay
the issues aren't resolved. You can't
help but wonder if bothering with
"MAG" is worth it when there are
other titles out there doing the
same thing, but better.
That being said, if the idea of
teamwork on such a massive scale
intrigues you, give "MAG" a try.
But if you're going into this title
expecting "Modern Warfare 2"
multiplied by 20, you're setting
yourself up for one hell of a disap-
pointment.

Ever since The Album Leaf
toured with Icelandic icons Sigur
Ros, the band has
established itself*
as perhaps the
closest American The Album
equivalent to its
expressive, oth- Leaf
erworldly coun- A Chorusof
terpart across the Storytellers
pond. The Album Sto
Leaf's fifth and SubPap
latest record, A
Chorus ofStorytellers, is a strange
and sublime set of instrumental
compositions.
For the last decade, The Album
Leaf has been a collaborative
project of its driving force and
chief instrumentalist, Jimmy
LaValle. He came loaded for bear
with A Chorus, the group's first
album with a full band, recorded
near Seattle with veteran musi-
cian Ryan Hadlock (Blonde Red-
head, Stephen Malkmus and the
Jicks) and mixed in Iceland with
producer Birgir Jon Birgisson
(Sigur Ros).
After many months of editing,
A Chorus places itself squarely in
the tricky sphere of instrumental
indie - the realm where a band
relies on the strength of its shim-
mering keyboard melodies, spac-
ey drum lines and atmospheric
harmonics to engage listeners.
Spare lyrics occasionally grace
a few of the album's tracks, but
vocals aren't the defining sounds
on the album.
The new record comes across
soothing, somnolent and bright.
Harmonious piano arrangements
and sweeping strings make for a
hypnotic, dream-like experience
that, for the most part, doesn't
disappoint. Just be sure not to
listen to it while studying at 2
a.m., because it's sure to cocoon a
fatigued listener into sleep.

LaValle delivers consistently
throughout the album but gener-
ally doesn't step outside his com-
fort zone,.yielding little in the
way of clear standouts. After the
first few songs, it's pretty easy to
guess the formula for the album's
songs: start with a repeating
piano or drum line, fold some
subtle and intricate melodies over
it and build up to a conclusion
with a pleasant solo at a higher
tempo. Like those cookies grand-
mas bake for holidays, the record
always tastes good but isn't espe-
cially shocking or fresh.
The main stumbling block for
the album is that the airy tracks
occasionally drone on. "Fall-
ing from the Sun," for instance,
repeats virtually identical melo-
dies and vocals in numbing cir-
cles. Redundancy within songs
isn't necessarily noticeable in
most of the album's tracks, but
can get quite irritating when it
does appear.

A Chorus sounds an awful lot
like The Album Leaf's last two
records, which isn't bad news
because Album Leaf has shown
it can routinely produce strong
instrumental albums. There are
differences between A Chorus
Album Leaf
creates another
satisfying yet
safe album.

and previous albums - the new
album is altogether sleepier and
less tense - but LaValle sticks to
the musical forms he knows and,
for the most part, does well. Fans
may cross their fingers for albums
that are edgier and take risks, but
LaValle's formula still works.

Spectacle
o outdoor
hockey is
priceless
MADISON - When I was 12 years
old, my family and I began a long-
lasting, simple tradition. With every
first snow of the season, my
extended family would gather
at our house tucked deep in
rural Michigan, for something
so pure, so harmless, so fun,
that we continued it for six
more years until I graduated
from high school.
The Kartje family snow
football game. RYAN
The game ran its course,
and it was never one filled KARTJE
with much athleticism, but
something about being out-
doors, running freely with the brisk wind
against your face (and generally freezing your
ass off for the sake of sport) that just felt unlike
anything else.
It's been three years since I've felt that same
purity of sports. No field turf. No heated seats.
And no way to plan for Mother Nature.
That is, until I sat down in the freezing cold
bleachers of Camp Randall Stadium Saturday
night for Michigan hockey's second outdoor
game in program history.
I hadn't packed gloves or a winter hat. My
layering was meager at best. And my teeth chat-
tered for the better part of two periods.
But as I peered down at the ice rink, sitting
squarely between both 17-yard lines, I felt the
same kind of nostalgic purity that I hadn't felt
since quarterbacking my family to a snow foot-
ball victory three years ago.
So much so that I pretty much had to be
dragged back to the press box.
And that's exactly what this campus needs to
reenergize a Michigan fanbase that's spiraling
toward clinical depression: the pure, freezing-
cold bliss of outdoor hockey.
At the Wolverines' Friday practice, the Mich-
igan players looked like kids in a candy store.
"I love it," junior forward Louie Caporusso
said. "I feel like I'm 10 years old again on the
pond with my dad. It's an unbelievable feeling,
and I'm cherishing every minute of it."

Penalties end Blue's bid in Camp Randall Classic

By MICHAEL FLOREK

ple, the Michigan hockey team still felt
isolated.
In the frigid confines of Camp Ran-
dall Stadium, with nothing above them
but black sky
and stadium MICHIGAN 2
lights, both WISCONSIN 3
Wisconsin -
and Michigan made the long walks
from their locker rooms underneath
the stands tothe ice.
All eyes were on the Badgers' trek,
which was lined by a throng of youth
hockey players. On the other side of the
field, the Wolverines shared the path

only with the zambonis.
It seemed fitting in the end. Even
with the novelty of an outdoor game,
No.19 Michigan had the same feeling of
loneliness it has experienced for much
of the season, with only itself to blame.
The Wolverines took two straight
penalties with under six minutes left
in the game. Two ensuing power play
goals by No. 3 Wisconsin (16-7-4) gave
the Badgers a 3-2 victory.
After going up 2-1 midway through
the third, Michigan was playing out of
character. Despite being ranked 11th in
the country in penalties, they had been
called for just one penalty the entire
game.
That all changed with about six min-
utes remaining. And it's only fittingthat

in an event that had as much to do with
the winter weather as the game itself,
it was a Summers that cost the Wolver-
ines.
Senior captain Chris Summers was
called for a tripping penalty. Ten sec-
onds later, the puck was in the back of
the Wolverines' net.
With about two minutes left, Sum-
mers was again called for a penalty. As
he argued with the referees en route
to the penalty box, the red-clad fans in
attendance went into a frenzy, jump-
ing and chanting throughout the entire
television timeout and into the Michi-
gan penalty kill.
"We were, I thought, carrying the
play five-on-five and it's unfortunate
that calls have to be made at certain

points in the game," Summers said.
"That's just the way the games goes....
He obviously saw something I didn't, or
maybe 70,000 other people."
Thirty-four seconds into that pen-
alty kill, Wisconsin defensemen Bren-
dan Smith, who scored Wisconsin's
first power play goal, jumped into the
slot. Smith took a cross-ice pass and
one-timed it past junior goalie Bryan
Hogan's glove.
With the same man in the box, the
same player scored on the same play
that led to the second Wisconsin goal.
"We knew pretty much what they
were doing, and they're good at it,"

This season, Michigan has played
quite a few bad halves of basketball.
The first half of Saturday's 62-44
loss to Wisconsin at Crisler Arena,
however,
 was not one WISCONSIN 62
of them. MICHIGAN 44
The Michi-
gan men's basketball team shot 60
percent from the field and made both
of its 3-point attempts. It even played
tough defense for the vast majority of
the half.
The only problem for the Wolver-
ines was that Wisconsin (8-3 Big Ten,
18-5 overall) couldn't miss. The Bad-
gers shot 68 percent from the field
and 69 percent from 3-point land.
Wisconsin guard Jason Bohannon
even made a last-second heave from
midcourt before halftime in the per-
fect cap to a near-perfect 20 minutes
from the Badgers.
As a result, Michigan (4-7, 11-12)
played one of its best halves of the
season, but went into halftime trail-
ing by 14, en route to a thrashing at
home.
"They're amazing," Michigan
coach John Beilein said. "Usually,
even teams at the bottom of the Big
Ten, which I guess we are now, can
stay with teams in the first half. We
couldn't even do that."
Besides Wisconsin's shooting, the

ers - just two the entire half. Cer-

Freshman Morris looks to
be floor general for Blue

ByNICOLE AUERBACH
Daily SportsEditor
Michigan freshman Darius
Morris is ready to change posi-
tions - slightly. Instead of being
simplya pointguard, he wants to
become the Wolverines' general
on the court.
Who better to tell him how to
make that transformation than
The General himself?
Gary Grant, a dynamic guard
for Michigan from 1985-88 who
earned the nicknamed The
General and was Big Ten Fresh-
man of the Year in 1985, was in
Ann Arbor this weekend for a
reunion. '
Grant watched the Wolver-
ines struggle through a 62-44
loss to Wisconsin. After the
game, he and Morris stood off to
the side of the locker room talk-
ing about the freshman's process
to become a general, too.
"As soon as we broke up out of
the huddle, I wanted to go (talk
to) him," Morris said. "He's been
through this. He's been in my
shoes. He was successful, so I
was just trying to get whatever
information I could from him.
He told me on offense just to be
a general, just tell people where
to go. He said everything would
fall into place.
"No matter what mistakes you

make or anything, if you have a
bad game, just keep your con-
fidence up. Even though I'm a
freshman, don't be afraid to tell
people what to do."
Saturday's loss, though the
score didn't indicate it, was
a good first step for Morris's
growth.
Michigan coach John Beilein
removed redshirt sophomore
Laval Lucas-Perry from the
starting lineup and inserted
Morris. He began the season's
first nine games in the starting
lineup but had been coming off
the bench in recent weeks.
The decision to start Mor-
ris came on Wednesday, the day
after Michigan was shellacked
by Northwestern 67-52. Morris
scored eight points and tallied
three assists in 33 minutes of
playing time against Wisconsin
on Saturday.
"Coach just said that I had to
be a solid point guard, it's what
the team needs," Morris said. "I
need to go out there and be an
outlet of him on the court."
It's been alongseason, and the
point guard position has been
one area where the Wolverines
have struggled all year. Sopho-
more Stu Douglass, naturally a
shooting guard, has talked about
challenges he's faced as someone
who has never really brought

the ball up the court on every
possession. Douglass knows
how hard the position is, and he
appreciates how Morris is natu-
rally comfortable there.
"He's been a point guard his
entire life," Douglass said. "He
knows how to lead a team....
He knows how to win, and he's
a natural leader like that. He's
been a big help this year, the win
and loss doesn't really show it,
but he's helped us a lot."
Morris echoed the impor-
tance of a point guard's leader-
ship. He emphasized being more
vocal on the court, and making
his teammates better by improv-
ing his own play. Part of that
comes from simply gaining more
experience.
"Three-fourths of the season
is under my belt," Morris said.
"Not really like a freshman no
more. I should be playing like
more than a freshman. I've had
an opportunity to get a lot of
minutes. You can't just go out
there and keep making freshman
mistakes."
Morris has shown that he's
learned from mistakes and has
made a concerted effort to limit
turnovers. He gave the ball away
just once in Saturday's game.
But, like Grant told him after
the loss, being a point guard -

It's been a recurring theme all
season.
The Wolverine wrestlers have
been unable to close out "swing
matches" in Big Ten competition.
They let early leads escape. They
come back from early deficits, but
fall just short. They lose focus in
the third period.
Look no further than Friday
night. Wolverine freshman Sean
Boyle took a one-point lead into
the third period over Ohio State's
20th-ranked Nikko Triggas before
he was pinned with 60 seconds left
in the match.
The performance typified Mich-
igan's frustrating season, and there
were plenty of reminders this past
weekend. The team suffered blow-
out losses at the hands of No. 3 Ohio
State and No. 11 Penn State by 20
and 19 points, respectively.
"We have to score early, be
aggressive, stay aggressive and get
our shots off when we need to,"

tunities."v
Each close match from this past
weekend was decided by at least
one of the factors he listed: scoring
early, aggression and shooting in on
the legs.
Redshirt junior Aaron Hynes
got off to a slow start against Penn
State's seventh-ranked Dan Val-
limont, as he gave up both a take-
down and a reversal before he
rebounded in the second period.
But his efforts were too little, too
late and he fell one point short in a
8-7 decision.
Redshirt sophomore Justin
Zeerip seemed to lack aggression,
as he scored just one escape point
against Ohio State's 12th-ranked
Dave Rella, logging 6-1. The low
score was partly due to Rella's abil-
ity to react quickly to Zeerip's dives
and protect his legs, but ultimately,
it was Zeerip who didn't get the
shots off.
The wrestlers who did heed

McFarland's advice were able
to garner individual victories in
each of their matches. Sophomore
Zac Stevens and redshirt junior.
Anthony Biondo accounted for
four of the team's six victories this
weekend.
And Biondo recognizes that his
four straight Big Ten victories have
been a direct result of McFarland's
advice.
"Earlier in the season, I was
focusing on the tendencies of my
opponents way too much," Biondo
said. "What I needed to be doing
was focusing on conditioning
myself to be more aggressive and
get in on my guy's legs as much as
possible."
Biondo's ability to get shots in on
his opponent's legs allowed him to
score six takedowns en route to a
major decision victory.
And it's clear that the team needs
to adhere to McFarland's coach-

The Michigan men's tennis
team dropped a tense match to
Pepperdine yesterday, 5-2, at
the Varsity Tennis Center. The
underdog Wolverines hung tough
against the 13th-ranked Waves,
but lost a couple close singles
matches that would have made
the difference.
The 36th-ranked Wolverines
grabbed the early momentum
by winning the doubles point.
They split the No. 2 and 3 doubles
matches before junior Jason Jung
and freshman Evan King won at
No. 1 doubles in dramatic fashion,
9-8 (7-5).
On match point in the tiebreak-
er, Jung hit a blistering forehand
that just caught the baseline to
seal the victory.
"My heart was pounding when
I hit it," Jung said. "I missed a
couple returns right before that,
but I knew I had to step in, trust
myself, and give it my best shot."
King, one of Michigan's high-
est-touted recruits in years, also
impressed during the match with
his creative shotmaking. The Pep-
perdine players seemed caught off
guard by the sharp angle of his
left-handed strokes.
But Michigan was unable
to capitalize on its advantage,
dropping four of the five singles
matches. The most dramatic and

controversial match of the day
was probably at No. 1 singles, in
which King lost 6-2, 7-6
(7-4) in his first appearance at
No. 1. Leading 5-4 with set point
in the second set, King hit a win-
ner that appeared to be in, but a
questionable out call by his oppo-
nent and the line judge's decision
to uphold it kept Pepperdine's
player Bassam Beidas alive in the
set.
The call was met by loud boo-
ing and accusations of cheating
from the audience.
"I hit the ball, I saw it go in and
he called it out," King said. "The
set was over, and then it wasn't.
But the ball was definitely in."
The controversial ruling
appeared to weigh on King's mind
afterwards.
He became much more ani-
mated and missed shots he had
been hitting consistently before-
hand. Even after the call, he had
two consecutive set points and
was unable to take advantage.
Beidas bounced back to win the
second-set tiebreaker and clinch
the match..
The fact that King was able
to compete so well with Pep-
perdine's top player showed the
potential that has many saying
the 17-year old King has a future
on the professional tour. But it
also showed that he perhaps still
has room to improve mentally.
"I didn't see the call," Michi-

gan coach Bruce Berque said.
"But even if it was a bad call, he
still had plenty of opportunities
to win the match afterward. Bad@
calls are a part of tennis. The key
is how you handle them. I think
that Evan's starting to learn that
if he wants to meet his goals both
in college and professionally, he's
going to have to fix some prob-
lems with his mental focus."e0
At No. 4 singles, senior George
Navas won the first set 6-3, but
lost the next two sets by the same
score in the longest match of the
day.
The Wolverines' lone single
win came from Jung, who took
care of business in dominatiig
fashion, 6-2, 6-2.
"I was actually surprised by
how easy it was," Jungsaid. "Most
of the Pepperdine players play
with a lot of fight, but this player
in particular seemed a little ner-
vous, and I was able to jump on
him and take advantage."
All in all, the day showed some
promise for the Wolverines, but
they knew they could've done
better.
"I have mixed thoughts about
our performance," Berque said.
"I'm happy with the doubles, but
I think we need to improve our
competitive maturity overall. We
have the physical skills to beat
these types of teams, but we need@
to give strong, competitive efforts
on all six courts to do it."

for the Wolverines came midway
through the third period. Fresh-

Michigan didn't look as though
it would be able to string together
a consistent enough of an attack
to score, like the Badgers did con-
sistently throughout the game.
Both teams had their chances,
but the Wolverines were more
isolated and had fewer quality
opportunities than the Badgers
were getting.
And it all came to a head when
Wisconsin scored its two power
play goals late in the game with
the same power play units and
same systematic attack each time.
The Badgers would win the game
3-2.
But Michigan was certainly
feeling confident after Lynch's
goal.
"It's a huge boost for the team,
a great shot," junior Ben Winnett
said. "We go down on the two-on-

that point, we thought we were in
very good shape."
Turnovers and poor puck con-
trol plagued the Wolverines all

team a lead in the third period.
Michigan's slow start offensively
had the team taking shots fur-
ther away from the goal, but as
the Wolverines settled down,
their shots were coming closer
in.
But if it wasn't for Lynch and
Vaughan, Michigan's offense
might have been non-existent on
the scoreboard. And with all of
the excitement leading up to the
game, it turned into a bitter end-
ing. They might not want to talk
about that one for a while either.

whole event "surreal" and couldn't
stop smiling.
And judging by Michigan coach
Red Berenson's lack of a coat for
the game's first two periods, he
was loving it just as much as the
players.
(For the record, Berenson told
us that "cold" meant -30 degrees
Fahrenheit. So the 21 degrees at
faceoff must've felt like Spring
Break for the Saskatchewan
native.)
But where the Wisconsin Athlet-
ic Department outdid themselves
was that the nostalgic experience
on the ice for the Classic's 50,000
fans extended past the game.
For those who got to Camp
Randall early to beat the lines, the

Badgers' practice football field was
opened up into a hockey memo-
rabilia/skills challenge/photo op
extravaganza that any fun-loving
human being could appreciate.
I mean, how else would I know
that my slapshot needs work and
my stickhandling skills would
make Berenson keel over?
Now, as much as the experience
made me feel all warm and fuzzy
inside, there were some logistical
shortcomings to the Camp Ran-
dall Classic's execution that the
Michigan Athletic Department
should note in planning "The Big
Chill at the Big House" between
Michigan and Michigan State next
December.
For one, not breaking the

hockey attendance record next
year - which stands at 74, 544
after Michigan took on Michigan
State in 2001 at Spartan Stadium
- would be unacceptable.
In Madison, there were inter-
mittent holes in the lower bowl and
the upper deck wasn't even shov-
eled off for fans. At the Big House,
they can't have that problem.
Michigan students have been
clamoring for a football game
under the lights for years now, so
slap a rink between the 20's, slash
the temperature in half and add
the most successful program in
college hockey history, and the
"Big Chill" practically markets
itself to students desperate for
something new and exciting on

campus.
Just make sure to continue all
the traditions that make Michigan
hockey at Yost great. Throw in a
full band. Use all the same chants.
Simply make the environment just
like a Football Saturday, just with
more ice and "Sieve!" chants.
The fact of the matter is, with
even just 90,000 or so fans at the
Big House next December, the
atmosphere should be unlike any
other in the history of the sport.
And even more so, for one
more shot at that sense of pure
nostalgia, you can bet I'll be in the
stands next December.

From the beginning, the game
was unusual for Michigan (16-13-1).
It gave up the first goal of the game
early in the first period, usually a
bad sign for the Wolverines. They
are just 2-11-1 this season when the

But they clawed back scoring one
in the first and broke the tie when
.freshman Kevin Lynch gained the
blue line and let go of d wrist shot

"Obviously the ice wasn't too
good so just getting shots on net
was our focus," Lynch said. "So off
the faceoff, we lost the draw but it
came right to (junior forward) Carl
(Hagelin) and he gave it to me and I
kinda just held onto it. I got across
the blueline and just let one go."
Despite Lynch's momentum

about having the right state of mind
and staying relaxed. With just seven
games remaining in the regular sea-

those qualities in its on-court leader.

field in the second, but that was all
they needed to put the game away.
Senior DeShawn Sims, Michigan's
leading scorer with 18, said shot
selection probably accounted for
Michigan's poor shooting in the
second half on Saturday.
"We could have shot even bet-
ter in the first half," Sims said. "We
missed some easy shots."
But it wasn't just the Badgers
shooting extremely well that allowed
them to beat Michigan so handily. In
Madison, when the Wolverines lost
an extremely close game, they out-
rebounded Wisconsin.
On Saturday, Michigan was out-
rebounded by 10.
The rebounds especially hurt
the Wolverines on the offensive
glass. Since the Badgers are so good
at making teams play defense for

the entire 35-second shot clock,
they often garner a gret deal of
scoring chances. And when they
grab an offensive rebound, more
than likely the other team will be
playing defense for around 65 sec-
onds straight.
"That takes your heart away,"
Beilein said. "Now you've guarded
them for 69 seconds. That is really
hard."
As for where his team stands
after the loss, Beilein conceded that
the Wolverines' collective attitude
was not good.
And before watching tape, it's
tough to find answers.
"I don't know what to do right
now," Beilein said. "We have some
days to work on our own game and
see what we can do before we go to
Minnesota."

Cameron earns
third invitation
to national team

Wolverines come
alive in second half
to run away with
conference win
By AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
After the Michigan women's
basketball team's 74-40 trampling
of Min-
nesota on MINNESOTA 40
Sunday, MICHIGAN 74
the team
was brimming with relief and sat-
isfaction in the postgame press
conference.
It was a huge change in
demeanor after Thursday's four-
point loss to Northwestern.
Smiles and laughter were in
abundance even before the game
clock ran out Sunday.
After a first half that saw five
lead changes and 25 combined
turnovers, a 6-2 run by Michigan
with two minutes remaining in
the half proved to be the momen-
tum change the Wolverines
needed. They never looked back,
earning their first 30-plus point
victory of the conference season.
Senior Krista Phillips fist-
pumped after making her third
3-pointer in three tries and soph-
omore center Carmen Reynolds
broke into a smile when she hit
one from downtown.
Sophomore guard Courtney
Boylan was the first off the bench
and went on to play 17 minutes,
providing the spark the Wolver-
ines needed to play above the
ordinary.
"It seemed like a little bit that
we were lacking of energy to start
the game," Boylan said. "It's Sun-
day, it's one o'clock. Sometimes
you don't have as much energy as
you usually do. So I kind of want-
ed to just come out there and give
us a little spark, give us a little
energy and I think that it really

helped us.
"We didn't come out in the sec-
ond half necessarily winning by
20, but we were up and we had
good momentum going into the
second half."
Michigan (6-7 Big Ten, 14-9
overall) was up by double digits
just two minutes into the second
half when a 29-9 run ensued,
kicking dirt over any chance the
Gophers had to come back.
"You could feel it that it was
going to go," freshman guard
Jenny Ryan said. "We knew that
we could find the seams (in the
defense). It was there, and I was
just telling (the team) stick with
it, keep hitting shots and it'll all
start to roll in. And in the end, it
did."
The Wolverines scored 45
points in the second half, more
than Minnesota scored the entire
game, and got nearly everyone in
on the party.
Sophomore forward Carmen
Reynolds made a jump shot as
she twisted and threw the ball
toward the basket as the shot
clock expired. Ryan threw herself
into the sideline in an attempt to
rescue a ball going out of bounds.
"When we came out after half-
time, I knew we were going to
come out with a lot of energy,"
Ryan said. "I could just sense it.
There was just one thing after
another. Open layups, we were
hitting shots, we made the adjust-
ments that were key. I wasn't
expecting us to win by 30, which
we did, but we'll take it."
After Northwestern stole what
would have been the Wolver-
ines' fourth-straight conference
win in Evanston on Thursday,
Michigan's domination over the
Gophers (5-7, 11-12) yesterday put
the team back on track.
And there is no better time for
a confidence-boosting blowout
than the game before rival Michi-
gan State comes to Crisler Arena
this Thursday.

Daily Sports Writer
Las Vegas dealt a solid pair of
threes to junior Chris Cameron this
past weekend - but not at the poker
table.
Cameron took third place all-
around at the Winter Cup Invi-
tational with an overall score of
87.600 to earn his third consecu-
tive spot on the U.S. Senior Nation-
al Team. Cameron's performance
is the highest finish ever for any
Michigan gymnast.
The Winter Cup Challenge is a
premier invitational which sets the
stage for 136 gymnasts to compete
for the U.S. National Team invi-
tation. The event consists of four
sessions, three of which took place
last Thursday. The top 42 gymnasts
then move on to day two, when only
15 men make the national selection.
"Usually you have a little fatigue
left over from the first day of com-
petition," Michigan coach Kurt
Golder said. "But Cameron was
really strong, which is just a great
characteristic to develop. He is
good at putting on the blinders and
blocking out distractions during
the competition."
Cameron set a season high on the
parallel bars and took second place
in both the pommel horse and floor
events. He has scored a 15.000 or
better in all five of his floor routines
this season, making him one of the

top floor competitors in the coun-
try.
Six other Wolverines joined
Cameron in representing the No.
1 Michigan squad at the Las Vegas
Sports Center. Senior Mel Anton
Santander and junior Thomas
Kelley both competed in the all-
around, receiving scores of 85.050
and 83.000, respectively.
Several Michigan gymnasts
excelled in their single events,
including fifth-year senior Kent
Caldwell.
Caldwell set a season best on the
floor with a 15.250 in his first-ever
chance to compete for a spot on the
national team.
"This has been one of my goals
for a long time, probably since I was
five years old," Caldwell said. "So
even just competing in a meet like
this was a huge goal of mine."
Junior Ian Makowske also made
his first appearance at the national
level.
Although Makowske struggled
on the floor and pommel horse, he
was able to put together a strong
high bar routine in the big arena.
Makowske broke his career best on
the high bar for the third time this
season with a mark of 14.350.
"Overall, the team had a really
great showing." Makowske said.
"It was an honor to be able to rep-
resent Michigan at something like
this and step on the national stage
wearing the block 'M.'"

Sophomore Courntey Boylan was the spark the Wolverines needed to go on a 2'
run and blow out Minnesota by more than thirty points, its biggest margin of vic-
tory this season.


conference is huge on our behalf
because we know how difficult it
is to win games," Michigan Coach
Kevin Borseth said. "But Michi-
gan State is an entirely different
game. Obviously we have to be
ready to play them. They are very
good."
Michigan State is headed to
Ann Arbor after winning four of
its last five conference games and
Michigan.will need all of the con-
fidence it can muster to even the

score against the Spartans this
season after State won in Lansing
in December.
"I think (we gained) con-
fidence," Ryan said after the
blowout. "We know that we are
capable of putting up big num-
bers, especially on our home
court. That's what is going to lead
us. We are going to keep working
hard and we will be ready. We

Botterman continues
her stellar year with
all-around victory
By STEPHEN NESBITT
Daily Sports Writer
Facing harsh snowy weather
in Morgantown, W. Va., the No.
15 Michigan women's gymnas-
tics team posted its most impres-
sive scores of the year to finish its
three-week road trip.
The Wolverines showcased
an excellent and balanced per-
formance from all 10 athletes in
the meet, earning a season-high
196.400 overall score in a tri-meet
victory against West Virginia and
William and Mary on Friday.
After starting the year with
inconsistent results, the squad
seems to have hit its stride at the
right point in the season.
"It all comes down to confi-
dence and believing in what we're
doing," Michi-
gan coach Bev
Plocki said.
"You have to "Ourtb
know you're
goingto be suc- really Ch
cessful in order
to be success- dow n th
ful, and I think
this team is
finally starting
to believe that all the way."
Michigan (2-0 Big Ten, 7-1
overall) received stellar routines
from every gymnast, finishing the
meet with seven of the 10 Wolver-
ines either setting or tying career
or season bests.
Matching its domination in
performance from last week in
Iowa, the team took all four event
titles as well as the all-around
crown.
"I was very happy with every-
thing we did tonight," Plocki said.
"I think this shows that our train
is chugging down the track and
we're really progressing. This was
definitely a good meet for us all
around as a team."
Freshman Natalie Beilstein,
who is three-for-three thus far on
winning the Big Ten Freshman of
the Week honors, set two career
highs.
She took the vault title with a

9.900, and finished as the runner-
up on the balance beam with a
9.850.
The Wolverines were again
boosted by junior Kylee Botter-
man's routines, as she posted sev-
eral career-highs. She won three
individual events - the uneven
bars, floor routine and the beam
- and won her third straight all-
around title with a career high
39.550 overall score.
While the team has counted on
her to tally a bulk of the points
this year, Botterman has accu-
mulated more awards this season
than anyone could have expected.
Still, this weekend's victory was
no big surprise.
"Kylee has had a terrific year,
and she just had a fantastic meet
tonight all the way around,"
Plocki said. "She was a superstar
tonight."
Although the individual efforts
have clearly helped carry Michi-
gan, especially as of late, the
gymnasts point to their team
confidence and
motivation as the
primary factor in
rain iS their recent solid
numbers.
iugging "I think every-
body looked
e track" great," Botter-
man said. "We
had a lot of ener-
gy tonight. There
weren't a lot of people in the
stands because there was a huge
snowstorm, so we had to make the
arena loud with our own voices,
and that really boosted our confi-
dence."
According to Botterman, the
Wolverines have pin-pointed
their landings as a major fault in
their game. Fed up with consis-
tently losing'tenths of points off
their scores, the team decided to
make a change.
"Our coaches made a board
for us, and for every meet we're
counting how many sticks we
get," Botterman said. "We have a
certain amount that we want to
get by the end of the year."
Has it worked?
"Well, when I went to vault
I was thinking, 'stick this, stick
this,' " Botterman said with a
laugh. "I almost think that I can't
do that because it wasn't my best

Michigan will employ this tac-

practice before Minnesota comes

As the regular season passes

six meets.
"I just want to keep trying to

together for us to be successful
the rest of the season."
