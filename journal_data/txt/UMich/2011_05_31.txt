STATE BUDGET
'U' talks
education
reforms
State Board of
Education requests
feedback on planned
teaching changes
By CECE ZHOU
Daily Staff Reporter
More than 100 members of the
University and Ann Arbor com-
munity gathered in the Michigan
League on Thursday night for a
public education forum held by
the State Board of Education to
encourage discussion about the
state of public education.
In response to recent educa-
tion reforms and budget cuts pro-
posed by Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder, including a ta-percent
cot to higher education, the SBE
planned an education forum series
to promote conversation about
education in the state. The Uni-
versity was one of multiple host-
ing sites for the symposium, along
with Grand Rapids, Clinton Town-
ship, Detroit and Mount Pleasant.
According to an address deliv-
ered by Snyder to the Michigan
Legislature on April 27, he plans to
reorganize the education system
to increase the quality of teacher
training, including instating a
requirement for more in-class
experience during their prepara-
tion. Additionally, he said he hopes
to shift the focus of education to
the quality of student learning and
test results.
Casandra Ulbrich, vice presi-
dent of the SBE, said the orga-

Regents approve
$13.7 million project
to accomodate new
research program
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
The University's Board of
Regents unanimously approved
the creation of a new health
institute as part of the North
Campus Research Complex at
their monthly meeting on May

19, prompting a multi-million
dollar renovation project that
will provide space needed to
house the newly developed pro-
gram.
The Institute for Health-
care Policy and Innovation will
develop research initiatives
relating to health care and public
policy. In order to accommodate
for the collaborative workforce
of approximately 500 employees,
the University will embark upon
a $13.7 million construction
project of Building 16 within the
NCRC, which will be completed
by Spring 2012.

Timothy Slottow, the Uni-
versity's executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer,
moved the board to approve
the renovation project - which
will add spaces for large meet-
ings and a fitness center - con-
stituting an addition of 120,000
square feet to Building 16 of the
NCRC.
Slottow said the renova-
tions are necessary for arrang-
ing about a dozen health service
groups in the building. He told
the board this collective gather-
ing will be an "exciting" devel-

STUDYING ABROAD
Students spend their summers around the world

V
opp
sti
inte

arious summer the workers around the villa
speak Italian to us, and all the
)ortunities allow shopkeepers in town speak Ital-
ian," Biltz wrote. "I believe that
udents to study, I will become more comfortable
with my speaking abilities as the
'rn and volunteer days go on, though Iknow that my
accent is still largely American."
By CLAIRE HALL Cultural immersion is an
Daily StaffReporter important facet of the trip,
according to Italian Prof. Sabina

While many University stu-
dents are staying in Ann Arbor
to take spring and summer term
classes, others have decided to
venture around the nation and
overseas to take courses, embark
upon internships or partake in
volunteer groups.
By engaging in worldly pur-
suits, many students said they're
gaining far more than just an addi-
tion to their resumes or a fulfilled
requirement. Instead they said the
opportunity to mingle with peo-
ple from different backgrounds
and ethnicities presents a unique
learning experience, as well as a
chance to learn more about them-
selves and their place in the world.
LANGUAGE STUDIES IN
ITALY
LSA sophomore Nicole Biltz
is fulfilling the LSA language
requirement while living in an
Italian villa outside Florence for
six weeks. In an email interview,
Biltz wrote that the experience
has allowed her to grow more
confident and independent, and
that by being fully immersed in
the language she has been able to
become more proficient in Italian.
"When we don't have class,

Perrino, the program's faculty
coordinator. Sabina said that in
addition to attending class Mon-
day through Thursday and com-
pleting internships at an Italian
elementary school, the students
also have the opportunity to trav-
el the country.
SOCIAL JUSTICE
LEARNING IN THE U.S.
The North American Sum-
mer Service Team proves that
students don't have to leave the
country to have a meaningful
summer traveling experience.
NASST, which operates under
the umbrella of the Ginsberg Cen-
ter, sends students to U.S. loca-
tions throughout the summer to
volunteer with local organiza-
tions and explore social justice
issues such as sustainability and
community health, according to
Lilliane Webb, business junior
and NASST's public relations and
outreach co-coordinator.
LSA junior Holly Godden
spent the first week in May in
New York City with NASST work-
ing with God's Love We Deliver,
an organization that delivers
meals to individuals struggling
with illnesses like HIV and AIDS.

"I really liked going into a
community and seeing how peo-
ple's lives are different than mine
and also how they're similar,"
Godden said.
Recent LSA graduate Anne
West's NASST team traveled to
Waco, Texas from May 3 to May
15 and studied agricultural sus-
tainability with the organization
World Hunger Relief. West said
the experience has reinforced
notions she learned in her courses
at the University.
"I can understand better what
I've learned in the classroom by
taking it out and applying it to
this kind of work, and then it res-
onates more with me," West said.
Engineering sophomore Erica
Mertz said her experience with
World Hunger Relief taught her
about more than just the orga-
nization's mission. Near the end
of their trip, they had to prepare
their own dinner with limited
tools, which involved catching
and preparing a chicken for con-
sumption. Mertz called it an "eye-
opening" experience.
"When you buy packaged
chicken in the store, you don't
really think about ... where that
chicken was raised or how it lived
or how it died," Mertz said.
HEALTH CARE
ASSESSMENT IN GHANA
The one-year, intensive cur-
riculum of the Accelerated Sec-
ond Career in Nursing program
normally does not allow for inter-
national study, so when a summer
trip to Ghana became available
this year, SCN student Peter

Kachur jumped at the opportu-
nity.
"I'm really interested in see-
ing (Ghana's) level of health care
and their knowledge base in
regards to medical care and nurs-
ing and learning about how they
utilize their resources," Kachur
said.
Nursing Lecturer Norma
Sarkar, the trip's on-site coordina-
tor, said that the group - which is
made up of both SCN students and
undergraduate nursing students
- will be visiting hospitals and
community care clinics, as well
as teaching about health issues in
schools in Tamale, the capital of
Ghana's Northern region.
CULTURAL IMMERSION IN
NEW ZEALAND
LSA junior Kaille Megouiar
is among a group of students
who spent four weeks in New
Zealand this past May with the
Global Intercultural Experience
for Undergraduates program.
Meguiar will work in schools
and on environmental projects to
study and promote revitalization
of land, language and culture in
the small island nation, accord-
ing to Cathy Reischl, an associate
professor at the School of Educa-
tion and one of the GIEU faculty
site leaders in New Zealand.
Meguiar, who hasn't been
abroad before, said the reason
she chose the New Zealand trip
over other GIEU destinations was
the unique opportunity to "join a
community, if just for a month."
Living with New Zealand fam-
ilies in home stays have allowed
the students to get a firsthand look
at local customs. LSA sophomore
Hayley Sakwa said the home stay
families take the students on a
variety of afternoon excursions
around the city of Hamilton.
"We weren't coming here just
as tourists, we were coming to
live," Sakwa said.
Sakwa added that her expe-
riences in New Zealand have
altered and expanded her per-
spective in a multitude of ways.
"I really liked how this trip
worked very hard at making the
effects of the trip itself last past
actually being in New Zealand,
learning the idea that you don't
know everything about everyone
and that they have more to offer
you than you have to give," Sakwa
said.

Farmers Market caters to the A2 community FrM Page1

Kerrytown strives
to attract more
undergraduates to
local goods
By HALEY GOLDBERG
For theDaily
Every Wednesday and Sat-
urday morning in Kerrytown,
local vendors set up stands in
preparation to greet the com-
munity and sell goods ranging
from freshly laid eggs to hand-
crafted jewelry at one of Ann
Arbor's best-kept secret - the
Ann Arbor Farmers Market.
Located on Detroit Street, the
market - which runs from7 a.m.
to 3 p.m. - allows customers to
buy an array of goods directly
from the people who create or
cultivate the products, creating
a distinct relationship between
local producers and consumers.
Market manager Molly Notari-
anni said the farmers market is
notoriously an unknown part of
the city for many University stu-
dents, especially undergraduates.
"I think that older students -
graduate students and doctoral
students - tend to know about it
more, but I think that it is defi-
nitely an undiscovered aspect of
Ann Arbor for a lot of University

students," Notarianni said.
Notarianni, a University
alum, said there is a separation
between University students
and the Ann Arbor community,
citing her own lack of knowl-
edge about the market when she
was a student. She added that
she hopes current University
students will make an effort to
learn more about Ann Arbor
culture through exploring the
farmers market.
"I think it is a really unique.
way to be connected with the
greater community of Ann
Arbor," Notarianni said. "It is a
great community event."
Engineering junior Joe Altiz-
er said he chooses to shop at
the farmers market to develop
a stronger relationship with his
community.
"I feel like it's more local,"
Altizer said. "You get that feel-
ing of Ann Arbor people making
and selling the food to you, and
that's definitely an advantage to
going there."
He added he thinks if more
students knew about the mar-
ket, they would choose to shop
there as well.
"If they advertised it more, I
know students would go there
and they would probably fall in
love with it," Altizer said.
Not only is the connection
to Ann Arbor a motivation for

Altizer to shop at the farmers
market, it is also an incentive for
businesses to sell their products
there.
David Klingenberger, founder
and chief fermenting officer at
The Brinery - an Ann Arbor
based fermenting company, said
he started his business by sell-
ing local, fermented vegetables
at the farmers market a year ago.
"There is no other way I
could have built my business as
quickly if it wasn't for the farm-
ers market," Klingenberger said.
"It's a way for me to directly
communicate and sell my prod-
ucts to people and really form
relationships and build my busi-
ness."
Richard Carpenter, a partner
of Carpenter's Greenhouse &
Organic Produce - a business
that sells produce at the market
- said he values the relationship
the market establishes between
producers and consumers, add-
ing that he offers a 10-percent
discount to University students
who present their Mcards.
This discount may offset the
slight increase in prices stu-
dents may encounter when pur-
chasing goods at the farmers
market in comparison to a chain
grocery store. Carpenter said
he recognizes the additional
expense, but believes it is a valid
tradeoff for the quality of food.

"Some items we have I think
prices might be more than say
Trader Joe's or Whole Foods,
but they are guaranteed fresh,"
Carpenter said.
Cynthia Olcott, founder of
the jewelry company Cynthet-
ics, said the eco-friendly nature
of the market also adds incen-
tive for customers to shop there.
"The goods here are trans-
ported short distances, so we
aren't burning up a lot of fossil
fuel," Olcott said. "Environmen-
tally, I think the farmers market
is definitely the way to go."
Many University students
who know about the farmers
market, however, said they still
choose to buy their food from
other grocery stores.
LSA sophomore Aerial Row-
land said she often shops at
Strickland's Market or takes the
bus to Meijer in order to save
time and money on food..
"(The farmers market) is not
the closest, and I just don't think
I have the money to go buy fresh
food," Rowland said.
According to Notarianni,
the market is beginning to col-
laborate with student groups to
help wth promotion, and addi-
tionally they have developed a
new, evening market that will
be held on Wednesday evenings
starting June 1in an attempt to
attract more students.

nization plays an important role in
recommending methods for imple-
menting top-quality education
programs in Michigan to the state
legislature, adding that ultimately
they have little power in determin-
ing the end result of state budget
reforms.
"One of the primary things we
don't have authority over is the bud-
get ... but we do have constitutional
responsibility that we take very seri-
ously to advocate on behalf of educa-
tion to the legislature and tell them
what we think investment needs to
look like in order to have the system
that's goingto be the most productive,
efficient and effective," Ulbrich said.
During the discussion forum,
Deborah Loewenberg Ball, dean of
the School of Education, said prob-
lems arise due to the lack of both an
established national training system
for teachers and guidelines of what
constitutes an effective educator.
"The problem that I can't over-
emphasize to you is that we have no
system in this country for producing
skillful teachers," Ball said. "But we
have no agreement on what it is that
people have to know to be teachers."
Many other education quality
advocates took turns addressing the
SBE about funding various aspects
of the teaching field, including a per-
sonal finance class, project-based
learning, innovative technology and
tenure.
Brit Satchwell, president of the
Ann Arbor Education Association
teacher's union, argued that educa-
tion reform has taken on the impli-
cation of budget cuts rather than
initiatives to improve the quality of
education.
"For many years now, we've
started with the assumption that we
have to take money we've gotten, cut
back from there rather than starting
with the needs of students and fund-
ing forward from there on," he said.
Chuck Fellows, a former Demo-
cratic candidate for Michigan state
Senate, said modern education poli-
cy is straying away from the goal of
allowing children to effectively learn
by instead focusing more on stan-
dardized testing and funding.
"Current educational positions
are about ranking and reading,
winning and losing, command and
control, policy and procedure, and
money," Fellow said. "Nowhere can
we find in there the true purpose
of education, which is learning. All
children know how to do that, and
somehow we beat that ability out of
them."

Budgetary blunder
Shortsighted state budget may hinder Michigan's future
Just as the controversy of Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's
tax overhaul was settling down, the Michigan Legislature
passed a disastrous budget that will have negative impli-
cations for years to come. Michigan's government may be mov-
ing things along, but it is becoming clear that lawmakers aren't
headed in the right direction. The tax overhaul was a risky step
that increased taxes on the poor and pensions in favor of busi-
nesses, and the new budget will create even deeper and longer-
lasting problems in Michigan. If Snyder is trying to improve the
future of Michigan, he must not pass this budget.

The idea of the "American
Dream" is perhaps the most cited
and valued ethos that this coun-
try subscribes
to. First used
by author
James Truslow
Adams in 1931,
he defined it as
"that dream of
a land in which
life should be MAX
better and richer LEVENSTEIN
and fuller for
everyone, with
opportunity for each according to
ability or achievement."
The American Dream is what
originally separated the United
States fromthe restof theworld. No
longer did feudal or caste systems
dictate the future of an individual's
life. Equal apportunity pave each
individualthe ability ta chase their
dreams. Even for myself, a critic of
most ideologies, this seems pretty
appealing. The truth is, Americans
still cherish the notion that all peo-
ple deserve a fair shot atlifenomat-
ter what economic situation they
are born into.
But how realistic is this dream?
In the past few years, the nation has
seen an increasing sentiment that
theeraofstrivingtoownahome and
have a successful career are over. I
am somewhat skeptical of this view,
but what if it were true? Perhaps
home ownership will decline and all
of our jobs will be outsourced over-
seas. Does this mean the end of the
American Dream? Absolutely not.
Although it may be great to have
these things, the dream is not about
the things we can get, but about the
opportunity to acquire them. As
long as this opportunity exists and
thrives, the dream is still very much
alive. There is one problem: does
the opportunity for individual suc-
cess still exist?
Equal opportunity cannot simply
mean free markets and limited gov-
ernment. In our realistic economic
environment, with a demographic
mixture of poor and wealthy citi-
zens, there is no reason to believe
that laissez-faire policy sustains
this equality. We can't assume that
the poor children of America have
the same chance of success as their
rich peers. Among other resources,
better education is an opportunity
given to the wealthy that the poor
rarely have access to. Without these
equal opportunities, the poor will
usually stay poor, and continue to
have limited abilities and resources
to improve their future lives.

In order to keep this American
Dream alive, we have to equalize
the opportunities of all Ameri-
sans, or at the very least, reach
some minimum point where even
the poorest individuals have some
chance to better their future. Pro-
fessors Bruce Ackerman and Anne
Alstott's book "The Stakeholder's
Society" offers one such possibility
to reach this point. They propose
that all Americans should receive
$80,000 upon reaching the age
of 21 if they graduate from high
school, no strings attached.
Does equal
opportunity
exist?
Imagine what impact $80,000
would have on an individual just
beginning adult life. They could
buy property, start a business or
pay off college debts. Each citizen
could decide how he will spend
his funds, allowing for personal
freedom and a viable opportunity
for future success. Of course there
will be those who fail and lose their
moneyjust as many people do now,
but this shouldn't detract from the
importance of creating chances for
all individuals. After all, the Amer-
ican Dream does not guarantee
success, but merely a fair opportu-
nity for its achievement.
As the $80,000 is meant to create
opportunity, each citizen must pay
it back to society (if possible) when
he dies, thus creating opportunity
for the next generation. It is there-
fore not charity or a welfare hand-
out, but a way of guaranteeing each
citizen a chance for success. There
is the worry of how to fund this
program, but Ackerman and Alstott
have figured out how to properly
and reasonably do so through a
2-percent wealth tax.
Is the American Dream dead?
Not yet, but it definitely needs to be
nursed back to health. I'm not say-
ing this $80,000 plan is the only
or even the best way to do so, but
it's just one example of something
drastic that needs to occur to keep
the opportunity for individual suc-
cess and the American Dream alive
in the future.

The budget's education cuts
are the most devastating altera-
tions that the Legislature
approved. K-12 funding will
be cut by 2.2 percent, though
this number can be reduced
if schools implement various
Republican-favored initiatives.
If, for example, schools require
teachers to pay into insurance
policies and pensions, they will
get extra state funding. These
demands will be hard to meet,
especially in the immediate
future. As schools adjust to the
cuts, many students and teachers
will be caught in the evolution of
the system, and the students cur-
rently enrolled will have to bear
the brunt of these consequences.
In a world that is placing
increased emphasis on educa-
tion, universities are essential to
Michigan's progress. The brain
drain is already bad enough in
the state, but with less fund-
ing for colleges, there will be
less attending them, making

Michigan far less competitive. A
15-percent cut is hardly a small
reduction, and universities are
going to have a difficult time
making up this gap. Many stu-
dents will be unable to attend a
college or university because of
the inevitable increase in tuition
or the reduction in financial aid.
It is crucial that people from all
means receive access to higher
education, but the proposed
budget does nothing to facilitate
this necessity.
Welfare will also see its funds
diminished, so poor families will
have to find other ways to make
ends meet. According to a May
27 Detroit Free Press article,
under the state's current sys-
tem, a family without a paycheck
receives $492 per month. 15 per-
cent of families will lose these
meager benefits and will have to
figure out how to sustain them-
selves on whatever they have
left. Considering the state of the
economy, it's hard to imagine

how these people will be able to
enter the job market.
The new budget also cuts the
funding of Michigan correction-
al facilities by 3.5 percent. In a
state that spends more on pris-
ons than education, this policy
seems like a no-brainer. Yet even
this initiative is tainted by poor
alternatives. One cost-cutting
measure is the outsourcing of
incarceration to private prisons,
which will only spur the growth
of prison populations and the
costs associated with it.
Many Republicans are patting
each other on the back for the
speed with which the budget was
passed, but it seems they opted
for immediacy instead of quality.
The Legislature may be taking
policy measures to reduce the
deficit, but each step falls short
of real progress. Certain efforts
may help Michigan in the short-
term, but the long-term impli-
cations do not bode well for the
future success of the state.

Prison pandemic

There is an epidemic of incar-
ceration in the United States.
Roughly one in 100 adults is hehind
bars. That is five times more people
than the United Kingdom, nine
times more than Germany and 12
times more than Japan, per capita.
I hear about the military-industri-
al complex from time to time and
have dismissed it mostly as liberal
hysteria, but one theory that I have
heard more recently- and one that
seems to hold more water - is the
prison-industrial complex.
In the past, the correctional sys-
tem in the United States remained
largely stagnant, maintaining a
relatively low incarceration rate.
About 250,000 people were in
prison in 1940 and the population
stayed around 300,000 from 1960
to 1970. But under the watch of
everyone's favorite president, Ron-
ald Reagan, the prisoner popula-
tion doubled from under 500,000
to about 1,000,000 inmates. Now
we have close to 2,300,000 pris-
oners in the United States and the
numbers keep rising. Prior to 1980,
California had two maximum
security prisons, and between 1984
and 1994 they constructed eight
more to house their massive influx
of convicts. Last week the Supreme
Court ordered the release of
30,000 prisoners because of over-
crowding. Clearly, the situation is
reaching disastrous proportions.
As prisons overflow, the private
sector is stepping in to fill the gap.
Every year there are more and more
private facilities housing inmates.
We have somehow allowed pri-
vate companies to participate in
an industry where the less money
they spend on inmates, the more
profit they will get to keep - not
to mention that repeat offenders
will only bolster this expanding
industry. Why would these orga-
nizations make any effort to reha-
bilitate their clientele? That's like a
store owner selling a pop to a cus-
tomer and then asking that patron
to never show his face in the store
again. Without some kind of elabo-
rate oversight, the use of private
industries for prisons is one that
favors high inmate populations.
Prison reform is looming some-
where in many people's minds, but
what is everyone waiting for? Pris-
oners are not a very relevant inter-
est group, nor are many of them
allowed to vote, but for both con-
victs and those individuals lucky
enough to be spared the gavel, the

prison system in this country must
change. Violent offenders probably
should be in prison away from the
rest of us, but in 2009 only half of
state prisoners were violent crimi-
nals, and only 7.9 percent of federal
inmates were violent offenders.
According to December 1998 arti-
cle in The Atlantic Monthly, 70% of
women in prison were non-violent
offenders.
So who are the rest of the peo-
ple in lockup? Politicians use the
War on Drugs to make themselves
look strong and tough, but these
shameful political ruses are afflict-
ing the poor and minorities. This
is no way to solve the problems of
drugs and crime. These inmates
filling the expanding prison sys-
tem are largely undereducated
and often mentally ill or have a
history of substance abuse. Drug
crimes account for two-thirds of
prisoners in federal prisons. Is it
in the best interest of the country
to put these people in jail? Should
their crimes even be illegal in the
first place? The racial demograph-
ics further reveal the travesty of
the corrections system as blacks
represent nearly 40 percent of the
prison population while they only
represent about 13 percent of the
national population. Conversely,
whites represent one-third of the
prison population and are 72% of
the population in the United States.
Michigan is facing its own ver-
sion of this national problem. Its
prison population is the sixth
largest in the nation despite being
eighth in overall population. It
spends nearly $2 billion on correc-
tions, exceeding the amount spent
on education. Gov. Rick Snyder
trashed the Michigan Business
Tax and levied taxes on pensions
and retirement funds, without
making significant changes to the
billions being funneled to correc-
tions. Cutting a significant amount
of that could alleviate the states
budgetary problems, and more
programs to cut recidivism will
help further on down the road,
much more so than his supply-side
economic policy. The problem is
that a politician will seem weak
if they are soft on criminals, so as
much as the state needs to change,
the public understanding of this
broken, self-perpetuating system
needs to change as well.

Embracing autonomy

In Puno, Peru, a small town on
Lake Titicaca, global power struc-
tures are being challenged. And
its pretty impor-
tant, but you can
be sure that you
won't hear much
about it. For all of
the apparent ide-
ological differ-
ences between --
Democrats and JONATHAN
Republicans, AYLWARD
there's no sub-
stantial debate
that challenges the global para-
digm. If there was, the world might
actually start changing.
This invisible subject is eco-
nomic imperialism. Legitimized
by all the powerful nations of
the world and the global finan-
cial institutions that they run,
the process occurs without resis-
tance - almost. That's where
Puno comes in.
Puno has been designated a
Special Economic Zone by presi-
dent Alan Garcia. This is a strat-
egy to attract foreign investments
in which nationwide labor and
tax laws are suspended within
the area. These regions exist glob-
ally, and are hotbeds of incredibly
cheap labor. While this maybenefit
those who work for these compa-
nies in the short-term, it ultimately
serves to maintain the global hier-
archy of nations that provide and
nations that consume.
The Canadian company Bear
Creek Mining Corporation was
given a contract by the Peruvian
government to harvest silver.
Lake Titicaca, an indispensable
cultural and livelihood resource
for the people of the region, will
likely be damaged by such opera-
tions. In an incredibly powerful
display of indigenous resistance,
the citizens of Puno have block-
aded the streets into the city and
have united to protest a process
that they had no say in and con-

sider detrimental to their lives.
Let's take a few steps back.
The earth has been divided into
official nations that encompass
the people within their borders.
These lands each have a set of
unique resources that are the most
essential wealth that a nation pos-
sesses. They can be used by the
people of the region or exported
for financial gain.
Since Europeans have come to
the Americas, with vast wealth
and the ever-increasing need for
resources, indigenous popula-
tions have been trampled and their
resources have been exploited. The
native populations of North Amer-
ica have been basically obliterated;
in Peru, only 14 million Native
Americans remain and they still
are strugglingwith Western states.
But does it need to be a strug-
gle? Perhaps a simple global law
would free developing nations
from the developed worlds' grip
and strengthen their autonomy
by forbidding foreign entities
from owning or controlling the
resources of another country.
To present such an idea is seen
as radical, but why? The status
quo is radically imperialistic,
and actively preserves the role
of nations as either exploited or
exploiting. A simple exercise in
empathy can help us see this: as
a native of a country, would you
want full autonomy to choose
what to do with your land, or
would you want someone in Van-
couver (as is the case with the Bear
Creek Corporation) deciding what
to do with it?
The West blindly clings to its
supposed cultural superiority, as
if it somehow excuses the erasure
of other cultures and depletion of
our planet by companies like Bear.
Creek. We have developed stable
lives with longer lifespans (unless
you live in a neglected urban or
rural area) and who wouldn't
want to have that? We are doing

the world a favor by spreading
our economic system and culture,
regardless of what a few misguid-
ed Indians think. Just give them
some time - they'll come to real-
ize a Filet-O-Fish is tastier than
anything that comes out of Lake
Titicaca. Right?
Maybe this is the case - maybe
everyone wants to live like an
American. But who are we to
assume that they do? By being
allowed to dangle our incredible
wealth around the world, some-
one will surely bite. Regardless of
who it is, the decision is unlikely
to be accepted by those who it
negatively affects. The compa-
nies and governments that sign
the contracts will benefit, while
the locals have to deal with the
consequences. Maybe a few jobs
will be gained for a while, but the
long-term consequence is the con-
tinued subservience of an entire
nation towards another.
Not everyone
wants to be an
American.
In a world driven by compas-
sion rather than greed, the U.S.
would be the first ones to step
up and support the people of
the developing world in their
struggle for true independence.
Unfortunately this is not the
world in which we live. Instead,
the burden falls on the people of
the developing world to organize
and assert their autonomy. This
is what the people of Puno are
doing, and they deserve our full
support and attention.

Ora Pescovitz, the Univer-
sity's executive vice president
for medical affairs, said at the
meeting that the Institute and
the renovations to the NCRC are
groundbreaking steps for the
University.
"By doing this renovation, it
will enable us to gather, in one
geographic location, the largest
co-location of health services
researchers anywhere in the
country," Pescovitz said. "So
this is a wonderful opportunity."
Mary Masson, University of
Michigan Health Systemspokes-
woman, wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that it is unclear if new jobs
will be created as a result of the
establishment of the new insti-
tute, though current University
employees could potentially join
what will be one of the largest
cohabitations of health service
researchers.
According to a May 19 press
release, the Institute's mission
is "to enhance the health and
well-being of local, national
and global populations through
innovative, interdisciplinary
health services research." Mas-
son wrote the renovations to the
NCRC will serve the goals of
the Institute by updating infra-
structural and systematic inad-
equacies in the currently vacant
building.
David Canter, executive
director of the NCRC, said
the Institute will facilitate
increased partnership between
several health programs already
housed in the NCRC.
"We're viewing this new
institute as an opportunity to
bring multiple groups together,"
Canter said.
Canter said Building 16 has
been vacant for two years and
is currently compartmental-
ized into multiple office spaces
that don't provide for much col-
laborative space, adding that
infrastructural upgrades will be
essential to fulfilling the Insti-
tute's mission.
"We want a lot of open areas
where people can meet and talk
and generally advance the idea
that we have at NCRC to be a
collaborative environment," 6
Canter said.
James Woolliscroft, dean of
the Medical School, will super-
vise the newly appointed direc-
tor and a search will begin this
spring to fill the position.

There's never any reason to sus-
pect that a sequel can't be as good,
if not better, than the original
movie. Just look
at "Toy Story,"*
"Harry Potter,"
"Lord of the
Rings" and even Hangover
"Pirates of the Part I1
Caribbean." But
the minute Phil At Qualityl6
(Bradley Coo- and Rave
per, "Limitless") Warner Bros.
cracks open his
eyes and finds
himself sprawled across a tile floor
in a cockroach-infested room in
Bangkok, everyone remembers
that there's a reason why nights
resulting in that kind of a hangover
are only supposed to happen once.
"The Hangover Part II" is
essentially a repeat of everything
that happened in the first movie.
Except this time, the wolf pack is
in Thailand for Stu's (Ed Helms,
TV's "The Office") wedding. But
the friends misplace Stu's fiance's
younger brother, Teddy, instead of
Doug. None of them can remember
the previous night and they must
piece it together in order to make it

same comedic value. A face tattoo
is way more serious, regrettable
and life altering than a missing
tooth.
In that same sense, "The Hang-
over Part II" is much darker and
way more twisted. Phil and Alan
(Zach Galifianakis, "Due Date")
find a finger in an ice bucket, which
is not necessarily an indicator of a
night that was wild in a good way.
With the original, the gang's antics
were believable - the guys were
the three best friends, perhaps
even your best friends. But in the
sequel, they lose their bro-next-
door quality. Stu, Phil and Alan
become people nobody wants to
party with out of fear of perma-
nently winding up in a Thai prison
with a face tattoo. Instead of fully
committing to the turn toward the
dark side, the movie tries to tame
it and connect it with the more all-
American Las Vegas scene, result-
ing in an uncertain combination.
The first movie was fresh and
unexpected with Mike Tyson's
tiger, taser-happy cops and strange
Asian men popping out of trunks of
cars. That element of surprise, so
essential to comedy, is completely
drained out of"The Hangover Part
II." The strange Asian, Leslie Chao

By MACKENZIE METER
Daily Arts Writer
Lately, I feel like I'm being
followed. Not by a person or
even an animal, but by an idea.
I just can't seem to escape it.
Everywhere I turn, I see wed-
dings. I see them in movies, TV
shows, songs, everything. Is it a
bad thing? Not necessarily, but
it's annoying. Just look at the
frenzy created by a certain royal
wedding - people got up at four
in the morning to watch cover-
age of two people from a foreign
country exchange marital vows.
Most girls dream of get-
ting married one day. Some
even start planning their wed-
dings from an early childhood,
which of course sets them up
for big bridezilla meltdowns
when their fairytale wedding
dreams don't exactly pan out.
I have never been one of those
girls. I have no idea where,
when or how I want to get mar-
ried. I don't know if I will have
a sweetheart neckline on my
dress or whether it will have
lace on it or what my "some-
thing blue" will be. Does that
mean I don't want to get mar-
ried? Of course it doesn't. Just
not any time soon.
Even though it might sound
like it, I am not picking on the
idea of marriage, even though
I'm sick of seeing it splattered
on everything. I saw "Brides-
maids" and I thought it was
hilarious. I read "Something
Borrowed" and I thought it was
a very nice little story. Of course
people live happily ever after
and of course people fall in love
all the time. Both of my big sis-
ters did. But people - especially
girls - are so focused on the
end result of dating - marriage
- that they forget to enjoy their
time as independent people.
Aside from college and the sin-
gle years to follow, there is real-
jy no other time e
completely devot
ourselves the bes lewe
can be without worrying about
anyone else - non blood-relat-
ed, of course - in the process.
And no matter what, it seems
we are inundated with the
thought of marriage at every

click of the remote. Think "Say
Yes to the Dress," "Shedding
for the Wedding" and - the
most horrifying of all - "Brid-
alplasty" in which contestants
are actually required to go
under the knife in order to win
a dream wedding. These things
not only make young women
feel like they need to spend
thousands upon thousands of
dollars on their own weddings
but also make women feel like
they must measure up to an
unattainable goal.
Beyonce never
mentioned it's
also OK to not
put a ring on it.
I think that people are still
so shaken by the recession that
they turn to things like wed-
dings because of the happiness
they are associated with. Wed-
dings mean love, a big party and
a special celebration with fam-
ily. Weddings are great. What
people are forgetting, though, is
the process necessary to get to
the rehearsal dinner and the big
white dress. There is a whole
progression of dating, of making
connections, of meeting fami-
lies and walking through a little
bit of life together before the big
day comes. And people like to
have someone walking next to
them - when times are hard,
it's so nice to have someone to
lean on. However, this does not
mean we should all race to the
altar. That special someone will
still be waiting and will step in
when the timing is right.
In the meantime, I cherish
my independence. Being con-
stantly inundated with images
of matrimonial bliss (largely a
result of the film and TV indus-
try) makes me cherish that
independence even more, but it
also can make it difficult for me
to just sit back and enjoy being
young and free - something I
hope to stay for a while.

Looking for
characters and
plot? "Bangkok
has them now."
The one character who manages
to preserve his integrity is Alan.
And while he does do the same
things he did in the first movie,
like talk about the Jonas brothers
and cause everyone that comes
into contact with him to ques-
tion his sanity, it works. With his
shaved head and piercing stare,
Galifianakis keeps Alan admirably
quirky and awkward. However,
as a character, Alan doesn't have
much depth (he's there for come-
dic purposes) and it is impossible
to expect him to carry the movie
alone. Sadly, it would appear the
difficult project of making a movie
on par with the first one. The cast
was swallowed up and most of the
"The Hangover Part II's" plot was
lost in the streets of Bangkok.

'Born This Way' cinches Gaga's edge

The Mother Monster
of controversial pop
sensation strikes again
By ARIELLE SPECINER
Daily Arts Writer
Whether it's dyeing her hair
black and white, getting carried
in via egg to the Grammy Awards
or debuting a
radio-friendly
song about one
of the most LdyGaga
notorious back-
stabbers in the Born This Way
religious world, lotorsco
Lady Gaga sure
knows how to
get people's
attention. And she does not fail
to continue this legacy with her
sophomore album, Born This Way.
The reigning princess of pop
and fan-proclaimed "mother mon-
ster" hits quite a few high notes
- both literally and figuratively -
on what could be one of the most
influential pop albums of this gen-
eration. Though that may be say-
ing a lot now, Gaga preaches songs

of self-love mixed with sex appeal
in a way that hasn't been done
since our Madgesty, Madonna.
Comparisons aside, Gaga is ready
to continue gracefully weaving her
way through the pop world with
outrageous outfits and outrageous-
ly catchy hooks (Judah-jud-ah-ah
anyone?) found on Born This Way.
The album is chock full of pop
prodigies such as the lead single
"Born This Way" (possibly lov-
ingly ripped off from Madonna's
"Express Yourself"), the smooth-
as-butter "You and I" and the are-
na-ready anthem, "Edge Of Glory."
Born This Way is jam packed with
'80s hairband influence, iiber
European techno beats and a cou-
ple of saxophone solos from the E
Street Band's Clarence Clemons
(yes, really).
In normal Gaga fashion, the
Lady throws some serious curve-
balls on Born This Way. Unusual
subject matter and multiple lan-
guages grace the album as she
sings about seducing John F. Ken-
nedy on "Government Hooker,"
her support for gay rights on
"Americano" and Mary Magda-
lene on "Bloody Mary." Those are
not exactly the key elements one

would normally find on a standard
pop album. And unless you live
under a rock, you know that Lady
Gaga has never been one to follow
standards - which is a prominent
theme on her latest album.
On tracks like "Bad Kids" and
"Hair," Gaga wants her little mon-
sters to know that they can be
whoever they'd like to be and not
to become one among the masses.
On "Bad Kids" she sings, "Don't
be insecure / If your heart is pure
/ You're still good to me if you're a
bad kid baby."
Born This Way not only shines
through Gaga's abilityto write cre-
ative and controversial material,
but also her vocal talent and musi-
cal aptitude. The New York native
knows her way around a solid song
writing session. On the highlight
of the album, "You and I," Gaga
slows it down to reminisce about
her "cool Nebraska guy" and belt
out "I love you." Though this may
seem like a normal pop theme,
Gaga gives it a twist with imag-
ery filled lyrics: "I couldn't listen
to a joke or rock 'n' roll / Muscle
cars drove a truck right through
my heart." In true Gaga form, she
brings gritty, greasy toughness to

Don't come too close, she actually does bite.

a love song.
In contrast to the sappy but stel-
lar love song, Gaga pulls out her
normal dance ways on tracks like
"Schiege" (which is 75 percent in
German) and "Judas." The beat
drops are every techno-head's
dream and even to the non-ravers
out there, the dance tracks on Born
This Way aren't too intimidating.
Lady Gaga manages to introduce
her "Just Dance" days to this more
modern and sophisticated scene.
While her devoted little mon-

sters may give this album two full
paws up, Born This. Way falters at
its over indulgence. Though Gaga
is known tobe over the top, there's
only so much over one can go while
still being taken seriously. Because
Gaga is such a public spectacle, she
puts too much energy in the perfor-
mance factor of her songs and that
tends to overshadow her talent. But
quite frankly, it doesn't matter if
you love H-E-R or not - because
realistically, she doesn't care - she
was born that way, baby.

Dance Works elicits inspired contemporary pieces

pieces.
"The opportunity to work with
faculty, guest artists and really tal-
ented dancers creating new work, is
what we live for," said Jessica Fogel,
artistic director and co-founder of
Ann Arbor Dance Works.
Fogel has been with the Uni-
versity for over 20 years, teaching
dance and inspiring young adults

to pursue an understanding of the
fine arts.
"This generation of dancers real-
ly wants to engage with audiences
that don't necessarily always view
the shows, that don't always attend
the concerts and performance,"
Fogel said. "The idea of having
encounters through performance
and dance with a new audience
excites our dancers."
For the 2011 Spring Season,
Fogel explained that it is more than
ever an expression of inspiration
on the part of the choreographers
and dancers alike.
"This is the creation and the
revival of dance. The show fea-
tures artists and choreographers
coming together," Fogel said. The
performance includes pieces by
Sidra Bell, Amy Chavasse and Peter
Sparling, along with Robin Wil-
son's "Feets!," "Blues/Crossroad"
and Bill DeYoung's "Tenfold."
"One of our choreographers,
Sidra Bell, was recommended to us
by many different people," Fogel

said.
Bell, the artistic director of Sidra
Bell Dance New York, has had her
work represented nationally, along
with featured debuts in Germany,
Greece and Denmark among other
European countries.
"It was interesting to see her
building a new work with our danc-
ers over the past two weeks," Fogel
said. "She's pulled together a very
stylish, exciting contemporary
work."
Along with Bell, resident cho-
reographers have also created
pieces to evoke appreciation for
dance from the audience. Spar-
ling's "Patient Spider" is a digitally-
enhanced screendance, featuring
the music of composer Yehuda
Yannay, and words by Walt Whit-
man from his "A Noiseless Patient
Spider." It mixes media and live
movement to produce what Fogel
describes as a "graphically beauti-
ful work." Furthermore, "a person
can view ('Patient Spider') on their
computer and it would be a visually

stunning piece," Fogel said.
Although there is an abundance
of dance fashioned online, some
works only come alive in person.
Amy Chavasse's "What Passes for
Tenderness" is a "wonderful piece
for six women, trading ideas about
tenderness, and cruelty, and the
double edge of that." According to
Fogel, Chavasse, through collabo-
ration and improvisation, explores
the ideas behind what defines ten-
derness in the 21st century and

what is contrasting to its definition.
"It's a very vivid way of experi-
encing one's own sense of meaning
through movement," said Fogel.
"And having an encounter with
the performance and then with the
audience."
AddedFogel: "Thisshowfeatures
really top caliber dance works, with
fabulous dancers. It's a great, inti-
mate performance experience, and
it's an opportunity to see things
close at hand."

Muresan, Bolender doubles pair slip in NCAAs

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan senior Denise Mure-
san and freshman Brooke Bolender
ended the Michigan women's tennis
team's 2011 campaign the only way
head coach Ronni Bernstein could
ask for - together.
And even in their last defeat, the
disappointment couldn't erase the
countless Wolverine triumphs.
Playing in the NCAA Individual
Championships in Palo Alto, Calif.,
the two remaining Michigan com-
petitors were bounced from tourna-
ment play in the first two rounds of
singles and doubles action.
Muresan's week started with a

victory in the opening round of sin-
gles competition, but it didn't come
easily. After dropping the first set to
Wake Forest's Martina Pavelec and
trailing 5-4 in the second, the situa-
tion seemed as bleak as the weather
which caused two delays during the
set due to rain.
But for Muresan, the prospect of
ending her season without making a
statement at the tournament wasn't
one she would even consider.
"I went in there a little nervous, a
little tight at the start of the tourna-
ment," Muresan said. "In the third
set, I relaxed and played well."
In the decisive set, Muresan uti-
lized two service breaks to advance
to the next round where Chelsey

Gullickson of Georgia awaited her.
After grabbing an early break,
Muresan then held serve in the
first set to get the early advantage.
But two 6-3 sets later, Gullickson
was through to the round of 16 and
Muresan's singles career as a Wol-
verine was over.
"For individuals, we wanted to
go further than we did," Muresan
said. "We worked really hard but it
just didn't pan out that way. It was a
great year regardless."
But there was little time to reflect
for Muresan, as she and Bolender
were slated to open up their play in
the doubles draw just hours later.
One of the faces across the net was
familiar to Muresan - Gullickson

was again the opponent, this time
partnering with fellow Bulldog,
Kate Fuller.
The Wolverine duo lost key ser-
vice games throughout the match,
leading to its elimination as Georgia
advanced 6-3, 6-2. It was an upset-
ting way for the pair's partnership
to end, as they had accumulated an
impressive 25-7 record this season -
a year that neither partner will soon
forget.
But while Bolender will con-
tinue her Michigan career in just
a few months when the fall season
begins, Muresan has donned Michi-
gan's maize and blue for the last
time of her competitive career. And
although she would have enjoyed a

better finish down the stretch, she
speaks of her time in Ann Arbor
with unparalleled enthusiasm.
"I think a lot of things made it
such a great experience," Mure-
san said. "Our team is really close.
Michigan has so much to offer and
that's what made it such a great
experience."
With the season in the books, the
Wolverines hope next year brings
them closer to their goals, including
a better showing at NCAAs and a Big
Ten Tournament title.

King earns All-American status, drops doubles with Jung

By ALEX STEINHOFF
Daily Sports Writer
Sophomore Evan King and senior
Jason Jung of the Michigan men's
tennis team made plans to stay in
Palo Alto, Calif. for Memorial Day
Weekend. They also had their sights
set on traveling to New York in early
September - the location of the U.S.
Open - where the winner of the
NCAA Individual Championships
earns a wild-card spot.
But those plans were cut short.
King reached the Sweet 16 in
singles - something not done by a
Wolverine in 19 years - before fall-
ing to the No. 5 seed, but not with-
out earning All-American status. In
doubles, King and Jung also reached
the Sweet 16, before bowing out to
the No. 5 seed as well.
In the first round, King upset No.
12 Tim Puetz of Auburn, but Jung
failed to do the same against defend-
ing champion and No. 9 Bradley
Klahn of Stanford, the school play-
ing host for the tournament.
After several hours of a rain delay,
King jumped out to an early 4-1 lead,
breaking Puetz's serve early. But the
Auburn Tiger fought back to trim
King's lead to just one game. At 4-3,
King suddenly turned on the jets. He
cruised to win the next two games,
before winning all six games of the
second set.
The sophomore's victory gave
* Michigan its first win in the NCAA
Individual Championships since
Matko Maravic won his first-round
match four years earlier. King, the
No. 21 seed in the tournament,
would next face Gonzalo Escobar, a

player ranked five spots below him.
Michigan's captain Jung was
unable to reach day two of the tour-
nament in singles with King.
Against the NCAA singles
defending champion, Jung rallied
off three straight games in the first
set to take a 5-3 lead. But Jung was
unable to close out the set twice and
Klahn pushed the set to five games
apiece, before closing out the set in
a competitive tiebreaker which fea-
tured spectacular shots from both
sides. But once the second set start-
ed, Klahn kept the advantage. Klahn
broke Jungto go up 3-2 before cruis-
ing through the next three games
to eliminate Jung from the singles
draw.
King kicked off day two of the
tournament with his singles match
in the morning. King dropped the
first set 6-3 and was broken to open
the second set.
But King responded with a sec-
ond-set victory, pushing the match
to a decisive third set, in which
Michigan's sophomore sensation
never looked back, completing a six-
game rally to win the match.
The win propelled King to the
Sweet 16 and officially earned him
ITA All-American status - an honor
a Wolverine hasn't had in four years.
Just over two hours after King
won to reach the Sweet 16 in singles,
he stepped on the court to do the
same in doubles.
Originally slated to play the No. 1
doubles team from national cham-
pion USC, King and Jung caught
a lucky break, as the Trojan pair
pulled their names from the doubles
draw. Instead the Wolverine duo

played the No. 32 pair in the country
from UCLA, Adrian Puget and Alex
Brigham.
Despite droppinga tough first set,
King and Jung found their stride
winningthe second set before cruis-
ing to a three-set victory 4-6, 6-3,
6-1. The win over the UCLA duo sent
King and Jung to the Sweet 16 for
the second time as a doubles team,
despite not playing together since
April.
Day three of the tournament
started off with King's third-round
singles match against rival No. 5 Blaz
Rola.
Rola claimed the lead early and
eventually took the first set. Rola
broke King again two games later to
take a 3-0 lead and a strangle-hold
on the set and the match.
With the match seemingly in con-
trol, Rola pushed his leadto 5-0 with
stellar serving and solid returns of
serve before closing out the set with-
out dropping a game and closing out
the match in straight sets.
"In this tournament, Evan kind
of made three steps forward and one
step back," Michigan coach Bruce
Berque said. "He lost to a very good
player, but unfortunately it wasn't
his best tennis today."
The loss ended King's singles sea-
son, but King's final 30-9 record was
the best by a Wolverine since 1998.
King later took the court with
Jung for their second-round dou-
bles match against No. 5 Roberto
Maytin and John Peers from Baylor.
Maytin and Peers played the
majority of the first set from behind,
but broke King's serve to knot the
set at five, before holding serve to

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com
Tressel's departure will rekindle rivalry in'The Game'

ile making the one-
Wijfmile or so trek from
our parking spot to The
Horseshoe, I saw plenty of Michi-
gan fans sprinkled throughout the
ocean of scarlet
and grey.
Usually one
would expect
their lives to
be threatened, P
called every
name in the '
book and TIM
berated with ROHAN
jeers and taunt-
ing - this was
the greatestrivalry in all of sports,
right?
Well, thanks to Jim Tressel, the
Michigan-Ohio State rivalry had
turned into a joke in recentyears
- when Lloyd Carr's teams lost it
was at least competitive, and then
with Rodriguez, itcgotugly.
Now, Michigan fans weren't
worth Ohio State fans' time any-
more. The Buckeyes knew they
were going to win ina few hours.
It would've taken a cruel and
sadisticperson to pile on, ontop
of the mess Rich Rodriguez had
already created for those people.
It was about everything that
produced the records, though,
when Rodriguez marched his 7-4
Wolverines into Tressel's slaugh-
terhouse last November. The truth
is: Ohio State was bigger, faster,
stronger and better prepared than
Michigan the past three years. The
Wolverines didn't stand a chance,

not with Tressel in charge.
With Tressel's resignation
coming early Monday morning,
the tides may be turning in the
Michigan-Ohio State rivalry -
those fans might not have such a
pleasant stroll to The Horseshoe in
two years. With Tressel gone, this
is Michigan's chance to make the
Michigan-Ohio State rivalry great
again.
Tressel improved to 9-1 against
Michigan that afternoon ina game
that his Buckeyes led bythree
scores athalftime. His teams out-
scored Rodriguez's squads 100-24,
and this loss allowed those Michi-
gan fans to miss the traffic and
head home early.
Tressel's teams routinely
pushed around Rodriguez's
spread-option offense and 3-3-5
defense, and even had a quarter-
back (Terrelle Pryor) better suited,
perhaps, to play in Rodriguez's
scheme. The Ohio State coach
made it clear from the start that
beating Michigan was going to be
a priority of his. Tressel was facing
a similar hill to climb than Brady
Hoke faces now - the Wolverines
were 10-2-1 in their last 13 games
against the Buckeyes before Tres-
sel took over in 2001.
The pendulum swung towards
Ann Arbor.
"I can assure you," Tressel said
at the time of his hiringin 2001,
"that you will be proud of your
young people in the classroom, in
the community, and most espe-
cially, ih 310 days in Ann Arbor,

Michigan on the football field."
He understood that the first
thing he had to do was beat Michi-
gan. Everything else he wanted to
accomplish would follow.
It was obvious Tressel was a
great coach and a better recruiter.
In his first season, 310 days after
he was hired, he beat Michigan
26-20 in the Big House. Craig
Krenzel made his first start of
his career and Ohio State entered
the game with a 4-3 record in
Big Ten play. The Buckeyes were
the underdogs against the No.11
Michigan Wolverines. But Tressel
coached Ohio State to a 23-0 half-
time lead and then held on to win.
That's whatgood coaches do: they
bring the most out of their players
and win games they're not sup-
posed to from time to time.
Although, 2004 was the only
other year under Tressel in which
the Buckeyes could have been con-
sidered decent-sized underdogs in
the rivalry.
The pendulum swung towards
Columbus.
Rodriguez's teams never
had that win-when-you're-not-
supposed-to trait. The Buckeyes
always had a chance with Tressel
there. The first step in beating
Ohio State was the changing of
the guard that took place in Janu-
ary when Brady Hoke took over.
His players break their huddles
screaming "Beat Ohio," during
spring practice, more than six
months before they playthe Buck-
eyes. He refers to the Buckeyes as

Former Ohio State footballcoach Jim Tressel announced his resignation Monday.

"Ohio," and his feelings about the
rivalry seem genuine.
For now, the pendulum stays in
Columbus until Hoke proves he
can beat Luke Fickell's Buckeyes.
Anyone who knows the Michi-
gan-Ohio State rivalry knows it is
based on each team having a peri-
od of dominance. But had Tressel
not known about Pryor's and his
cohort's wrongdoings, then it
would've been harder for Hoke to
end Ohio State's current seven-
game winning streak in the rivalry
- the longest it has ever had.
"The head of the scarlet and
grey Demon has been cut off,"
Michigan's best defensive player,
nose tackle Mike Martin tweeted
on Monday.
With Rodriguez's failings and

the prolonged drought against
Ohio State, Michigan is desperate
for a swing in the pendulum. As
The Columbus Dispatch points out
in the upper left corner of its Ohio .
State sports page - the counter
remains even if you are reading
about the men's or women's bas-
ketball teams - that, as of Monday,
it has been 2746 days since Michi-
gan last beat Ohio State in football.
In Brady Hoke's office it is
counting down: 180 days, so-many
hours and minutes and seconds
until Nov. 26, when he gets his first
turn to beat "Ohio."
His chances got a lot better on
Monday.

Jim Tressel resigns amidst scandal, NCAA allegations

By STEPHENJ. NESBITT
DailySportsEditor
Ohio State announced the resig-
nation of embattled football coach
Jim Tressel on Monday.
Tressel, who posted a 106-22
record in 10 seasons in Columbus
and guided the Buckeyes to the
2002 national title, saw his job
security wane in the wake of an
ongoing NCAA investigation into
the program for multiple viola-
tions.
During his tenure, Tressel's
Buckeyes had unparalleled suc-
cess against Michigan, going 9-1,
including a current stretch of sev-
en-consecutive victories. Tressel
will be replaced by interim head
coach Luke Fickell for the 2011

season.
"After meeting with University
officials, we agreed that it is in
the best interest of Ohio State that
I resign as head football coach,"
Tressel said Monday. "The appre-
ciation that Ellen and I have for the
Buckeye Nation is immeasurable."
In March, President E. Gordon
Gee and Athletic Director Gene
Smith both voiced their support
for Tressel, who then admitted
that he withheld information con-
cerning ineligible players in 2010.
"I'm just hoping the coach
doesn't dismiss me," Gee joked at a
press conference March 8.
Initially, Tressel was given just
a two-game ban with a $250,000
fine - five of his players, includ-
ing star quarterback Terelle Pryor,

were previously given six-game
suspensions for their part in sell-
ing memorabilia to a local tattoo
parlor, as well as receiving dis-
counted tattoos - Tressel asked
that his suspension be increased
to match his players.' Tattoo-par-
lor owner Edward Rife was then
under investigation for drug traf-
ficking.
The program came under
increased heat when The Colum-
bus Dispatch reported a suspicious
connectionthat Ohio State football
players and families shared with
Columbus-area car dealers. The
Universtity's director of compli-
ance is currently investigating 50
separate car sales to Buckeye ath-
letes.
Tressel's hot seat grew hotter

and the fever pitch surrounding
Ohio State football heightened
this week when former Buckeye
wide receiver Ray Small told The
Lantern - the Ohio State student
newspaper - that he saw the sell-
ing of memorabilia and car deals
as commonplace for Buckeye ath-
letes.
"I had sold my things but it was
just for the money," Small said.
"We had four Big Ten rings. There
was enough to go around."
Finally, after more than sixth
months of investigations and
a battery of NCAA allegations
detailing that Tressel "permitted
football student-athletes to par-
ticipate in intercollegiate athlet-
ics while ineligible" and "failed to
deport himself ... (with) honesty

and integrity," Tressel has called
it quits.
He finishes as the No. 2 coach
in Big Ten history in terms of win-
ning percentage (.828).
Although the NCAA has not yet
released its penalties against Ohio
State, which are expected later this g
fall, Smith and Ohio State are try-
ing to look beyond the Jim Tressel
era, one that will be remembered
forever in Buckeye lore - for bet-
ter and for worse.
"We look forward to refocus-
ing the football program on doing 4
what we do best," Smith said. "We
look forward to supporting Luke
Fickell in his role as our football
coach. We have full confidence in
his ability to lead our football pro-
gram."
