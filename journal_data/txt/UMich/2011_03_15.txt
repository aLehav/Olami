SPRING COMMENCEMENT 2011

CAMPUS CONSTRUCTION
Law School receives $20M
for dormitory renovations

Some to address
regents regarding
graduation choice at
Thursday meeting
By HALEY GLATTHORN
Daily StaffReporter
This year's University gradu-
ates may receive their degrees
amid empty seats and outraged
protestors instead of the presi-
dential security and hype that
characterized last spring's com-
mencement ceremony.
Students have expressed
mixed emotions about the
University's decision to have
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
deliver the Spring Commence-
ment address in the Big House
on April 30, pending approval
by the University's Board of
Regents. Students unhappy with
the University's choice have
voiced disappointment, saying
Snyder is less. impressive than
last year's spring commence-
ment speaker, President Barack
Obama. Other students disap-
prove of Snyder's proposed

funding cuts to higher educa-
tion, saying his delivery of the
commencement address is hyp-
ocritical.
Upset with the selection of
Snyder as speaker, LSA senior
Richard Burance organized an
online petition and future pro-
tests through Facebook. The
protests are scheduled to occur
this week to advocate changing
the speaker.
Within one hour of its cre-
ation, the petition had 380 stu-
dent signatures, and as of 12:30
last night, 2,879 students signed
it.
"We acknowledge that the
governor is a respectable poli-
tician and a good representa-
tive for our state," Burance
said. "(However), we feel at this
time that his actions towards
higher education funding have
rendered his decision to be
commencement speaker hypo-
critical."
There are three Facebook
events and one Facebook page
dedicated to protesting Snyder
as speaker. The most popular
of the events had 506 attend-
ing members as of 12:30 last

'U' alum Charles
Munger donates
funds for updates
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
and KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily News Editor and
DailyStaffReporter
Famous for its ethereal stone
walls, the Law Quadrangle is a
common site for weddings and

other formal events. But new
renovation plans could make the
interiors of the exclusive Law-
yers Club and John P. Cook Dor-
mitory just as well-known as its
exterior.
At its monthly meeting to be
held in Detroit on Thursday, the
University's Board of Regents
is expected to approve a $39
million construction project
to renovate two buildings that
are home to about 260 Law stu-
dents. Of the sum, $20 million

was donated by University alum
Charles Munger, vice chair of
Berkshire Hathaway.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman wrote in a press
release yesterday that Mung-
er's donation will help the Law
School's buildings meet the
high-quality standards set by its
education.
"The Law Quad is an icon of
U-M's excellence in legal educa-
tion, and its prominence is now
ensured for future generations

because of Charlie's generos-
ity," Coleman wrote. "I am par-
ticularly pleased because this
gift directly benefits the living-
learning experience for our law
students."
After graduating from the
University, Munger attended
Harvard Law School, which he
graduated from in 1948. He was
awarded an honorary Doctorate
of Law degree at the University's
Winter 2010 Commencement in

which will be held in Detroit.
If approved, Davis-Blake's
position as dean will begin on
Aug. 22. University officials
announced last month that
Davis-Blake will succeed cur-

Dolan. Dolan, who has been dean

of the school since 2001, decided
in March 2010 not to pursue a
third term, which is five years
in length. Eugene Anderson, the
senior associate dean for aca-

Before her son was even born,
Rosemary Ellinger was told her
baby wouldn't survive without
the support of a medical machine.

Ellinger's son, Mason, was
prenatally diagnosed at the Uni-
versity Hospital with congenital
diaphragmatic hernia -a mal-
formation of the diaphragm due
to a birth defect. Because of this
severe condition, there was a
99-percent chance he would need
extracorporeal membrane oxy-
genation, or ECMO, to live.
The machine is composed of a

which pump blood from the body,

Students drawn
to professor's
interactive classes
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Standing in front of a crowd
of about 200 people, Law Prof.
Don Herzog felt a little out ofhis
element on the stage of Rack-
ham Auditorium last night, not

used to the formal setting for
his lecture.
Herzog is more used to the
front of a classroom as his stage,
where perhaps his greatest
trademark is his active use of
his desk during class.
"He's just all over it," Law
student Jennifer Walker, a stu-
dent of Herzong's said. "He'll
jump on it, he'll jump off it, he'll
jump back on."
Herzog admitted he felt out
of place without his desk.

"I felt confined by the lec-
ture," he wrote in an e-mail last
night.
Herzog - who received this
year's Golden Apple Award - is
one professor who is often the
main attraction when it comes
to his classes. Last night, Her-
zog, the Edson R. Sunderland
Professor of Law in the Law
School and a professor of politi-
cal science, delivered the 21st
annual Golden Apple Lecture.

Fast food places vetted by'U'

Despite several fast
food options in University
Unions, students may not be
able to order some of their
favorite eats, like an Arby's
roast beef sandwich or this
season's Shamrock Shake
from McDonald's, without
taking a drive off campus.
Though the University
doesn't have any provisions
that prohibit competing
establishments from set-
ting up shop on campus,
vendors typically opt out
of moving into the same
facilities as their major com-
petitors, according to Uni-
versity spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham.
However, there have
CRIME NOTES

been exceptions. McDon-
ald's occupied the space now
filled by Panda Express in
Pierpont Commons while
Wendy's was concurrently
operating in the Michigan
Union. And currently, Sub-
way and Quiznos are both
contracted with the Uni-
versity in the Union and
Pierpont Commons, respec-
tively, despite being compet-
ing vendors, according to
Cunningham.
The University's pro-
cess of determining which
restaurants will come to
campus is a lengthy one,
Cunningham wrote in an
e-mail interview.
Whenever a contract with

a food vendor ends, existing
vendors may submit a pro-
posal to expand their loca-
tions on campus. Outside,
vendors are also encouraged
to compete for the space,
Cunningham wrote.
A committee of students
and staff review the poten-
tial vendors' proposals and
judge them based on their
product quality, customer
service and operator expe-
rience, among other things,
according to Cunningham. z
The evaluation process often
includes trips to off campus
locations to judge the restau- ANiELLt TOLL/Oai
rants' quality, she wrote. LSA junior TI Scott and Subway employee Zanthus Al-lateef (right) make
sandwiches for Engineering junior Andrew Roach, LSA freshman Mary

SNYDER
From Page 1
night and was created by LSA
senior Zach Goldsmith, who has
planned a Diag protest sched-
uled for tomorrow.
Snyder's proposed budget for
the 2012 fiscal year cuts funding
to Michigan's public universities
by 15 percent. This number will
be even higher if schools don't
cap tuition increases for in-
state students at 7.1 percent. In
such an event, the University's
state funding would decrease by
about 20 percent.
With a 15-percent reduction
in state dollars, the Univer-
sity would get nearly $47.5 mil-
lion less than what it currently
receives - $316 million. And if
the University faces a 20-per-
cent decrease in state funding, it
would see a $61.5 million decline
in state funds.
Burance and Ashlee Lori Will,
a junior at the University's Dear-
born campus who is not cur-
rently enrolled, said they plan to

attend the University's Board of
Regents Meeting on Thursday to
address the regents on the issue
and try to persuade them to
choose another commencement
speaker.
Burance said he hopes to
present the Board with a peti-
tion signed by 2,000 to 3,000
students who support changing
the speaker. Students from sev-
eral campus groups and orga-
nizations, such as members of
co-operative housing and the
University's chapter of Col-
lege Democrats, have expressed
negative opinions about the
prospect of Snyder speaking,
Burance said.
But other students, like LSA
sophomore Vinh Phung, said
they expect the speech to be an
interesting opportunity to hear
Snyder's perspective.
"(He) has some controver-
sial ideas," Phung said. "It will
be good to get his ideas out. We
should be open to everybody, not
so close-minded."
Lori Will has begun organiz-
ing a protest set to occur during

the commencement ceremony if
the speaker isn't changed. She
said she and other protestors
would bring signs and "make as
much noise as possible" outside
Michigan Stadium during Sny-
der's speech.
"We're not looking to destroy
the commencement (ceremony)
and the achievement that the
students have made by get-
ting their degrees," Lori Will
said. " ... At this point, it's early
on, (but) I have a feeling we're
going to get an immense amount
of support from an immense
amount of organizations and
people."
The city of Ann Arbor
requires that protestors obtain
a permit 60 working days prior
to the event. Lori Will said she
has contacted the American
Civil Liberties Union for assis-
tance.
Burance expressed his disap-
pointment that the focus of com-
mencement has shifted too far
toward politics instead of repre-
senting the achievements of the
students.

"People who feel strongly
about the state and the Univer-
sity would be great speakers,"
Burance said. "With the gover-
nor, I don't think he feels that
same way."
Burance and Lori Will each
said their disapproval of the
University's choice doesn't stem
from political affiliation but
from Snyder's plan to cut higher
education funding.
However, other students feel
more positively about Snyder's
upcoming speech.
"Obama (is) a hard act to fol-
low. I think it's the next best
thing," Business School senior
Alecos Nicolaou said. "He's well
known (and) an (alum). I think
(he's) a good choice."
LSA sophomore Adrianna
Katsimpalis said she thinks Sny-
der could have a positive impact
on the ceremony.
"He's obviously still an impor-
tant political figure," Katsim-
palis said. "There's no way
anyone was going to compare to
Obama. It's an interesting con-
trast."

that she is thrilled to be coming
to Ann Arbor.
"The three things I'm most
excited about are the amazing
faculty, the world-class programs

many great programs," she said.
REGENTS TO CONSIDER
RENOVATIONS TO
UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
The University Hospital will
likely get the green light to pro-
ceed with a $6 million renovation
and expansion to its Medical Pro-
cedure Unit.
The construction plan includes
a 4,000-square-foot expansion to
the unit and a 2,200-square-foot
renovation of a nearby storage
space, according to a communica-
tion to the regents by Ora Pesco-
vitz, the University's executive
vice president for medical affairs,
and Timothy Slottow, the Uni-
versity's executive vice president
and chief financial officer.
The renovation and expan-
sion will add new preparatory
and recovery bays, something
the hospital is currently lacking,
Pescovitz and Slottow wrote in
-the communication.
"The medical procedure unit
(MPU) at University Hospital
has a ratio of 2.3 prep/recovery
bays per procedure room, well
below the industry standard of
four to one, hindering patient

throughput," Pescovitz and Slot-
tow wrote.
The project will also create
procedure rooms and storage
space, in addition to upgrading
and renovating the waiting room.
The project,whichwill take place
in several phases, is scheduled to
be finished in spring2012.
REGENTS TO
APPROVE SALE OF
COMMERCIAL PAPER
The regents are also expected
to approve the sale of up to $200
million in commercial paper to
replace the current commercial
paper program that is expiring
Commercial paper are short-
term debts the University sells to
investors in order to finance con-
struction projects. The Univer-
sity is obligated to pay back the
debt in at least 270 days.
According to a communication
to the regents written by Slottow,
the previous series of commer-
cial paper issuances expired in
November 2009.
"The existing commercial
paper program needs to be
replaced by a new program to
allow short-term funding of
capital projects financed by tax-
exempt debt and refunding of
outstandingdebt," Slottowwrote.
The funds generated from sell-
ing the commercial paper could
be used to fund several construc-
tion projects around campus,
Slottow wrote. These projects
include renovations to Alice
Lloyd Residence Hall, Crisler
Arena and the C.S. Mott Chil-
dren's and Von Not Voil Voigt-
lander Women's Hospitals.

Hospitals avoid
hiring smokers to
promote health
If you're a smoker, there are no
jobs for you at some Michigan hos-
pitals who are not hiring tobacco
users as part of their missions sup-
porting healthier communities.
The Detroit News reports that
Rochester's Crittenton Hospital,
Adrian's Bixby Medical Center
and Tecumseh's Herrick Medical
Center only are hiring nonsmok-
ers and people who don't use
tobacco.
ProMedica wellness director

SANTA CRUZ, Calif.
Calif. damage from
tsunami estimated
to be $40 million
A California official estimates
that statewide damage from last
week's tsunami exceeds $40 mil-
lion.
Mike Dayton, acting secretary
of the Emergency Management
Agency, gave the estimate yester-
day after touring Santa Cruz Har-
bor, where 18 vessels sank, about
100were damaged and another 12
remained unaccounted for.
The damage in Santa Cruz
Harbor alone is estimated at $17
million.
Officials at Crescent City
Harbor, which also suffered sig-
nificant wave damage, are still
working on a damage total.
Dayton watched as recovery
crews used large inflatable pil-

MANAMA, Bahrain
Saudi-led military
enters Bahrain to
quell civil unrest
A Saudi-led military force
crossed into Bahrain yesterday
to prop up the monarchy against
widening demonstrations,
launching the first cross-border
military operation to quell unrest
since the Arab world's rebellions
began in December.
Opposition groups immedi-
ately denounced the intervention
as an occupation that pushed the
tiny island kingdom dangerously
close to a state of "undeclared
war."
Bahrain's majority Shiite Mus-
lims see an opportunity to rid
themselves of two centuries of
rule by a Sunni monarchy. But
Gulf Sunni leaders worry that any
cracks in Bahrain's ruling system
could threaten their own founda-
tions. Protests are already flaring
in Oman, Kuwait and even tightly

ruled Saudi Arabia.

St. Lucia condemns
attack on group of
gay U.S. tourists
A robbery and assault on three
gay American tourists at their
vacation cottage has St. Lucia
officials scrambling to assure vis-
itors that the southern Caribbean
island is safe and welcoming for
homosexuals.
Tourism Minister Allen Chas-
tanet issued an apology yesterday
to three men from Atlanta after
masked bandits broke into their
mountain rental home in Soufri-
ere. One victim said the gunmen
made slurs against gays, white
people and Americans during the
March 3 assault.
The tiny, tourism-dependent
Caribbean country is typically
peaceful and a safe place for all
kinds of travelers, Chastanet said.
He said the attack was "unac-
ceptable behavior and our desti-
nation will not tolerate it."
Police announced yesterday
that they have arrested two sus-
pects in the assault and are look-
ing for three more.

December.
The $19 million cost of the
construction that won't be cov-
ered by the donation will be paid
for by the Lawyers Club and
"central university investment
proceeds," accordingto the press
release.
Timothy Slottow, the Uni-
versity's executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer,
wrote in a communication to the
regents that 92,000 square feet
of both buildings will be reno-
vated to update the plumbing,
heating, ventilation, fire detec-
tion and suppression systems,
Internet access and handicap
accessibility.
Additionally, a hallway con-
necting all the dorm rooms will
be added to each building to
"increase safety, accessibility
and sense of community for the
residents," Slottow wrote.
While the interior of thebuild-
ings will be changed, the fagades
will remain intact, according to
the press release. Air condition-
ing will also be installed.
Still, Slottow wrote that the
University is committed to
ensuring the renovations are
environmentally friendly.
"We will target overall energy
performance to exceed national

Tuesday, March 15, 2011 - 3
energy efficiency standards by
more than 30 percent," he wrote.
The club wing of the Lawyers
Club, which houses the build-
ing's dining hall, will receive
several infrastructure updates,
including a new roof. The club
wing is located on State Street
and is connected to the dormi-
tory wing ofthe Lawyers Club on
South University Avenue.
In a separate communica-
tion to the regents, Slottow and
Law School Dean Evan Camink-
er requested authorization to
rename the north Lawyers Club
dormitories The Charles T.
Munger Residences in the Law-
yers Club.
"With the renovations made
possible by Mr. Munger's
generosity, the Law School's
living spaces will aptly comple-
ment its world-class scholarly
and instructional offerings,"
Caminker and Slottow wrote.
This isn't Munger's first dona-
tion to the Law School. In 2007,
Munger donated $3 million for
lighting upgrades in the Law
Quad.
The Law School is also con-
structing a new building, South
Hall, which is projected to be
completed in 2012. If approved
by the Ann Arbor Planning Com-
mission, a pedestrian mall will
span Monroe Street and connect
the new South Hall with existing

- primarily infants - with fail-
ing hearts or lungs, according to
Jonathan Haft, a cardiac surgeon
at the University Hospital.
With about 80 to 100 ECMO
patients a year, the University
Hospital currently maintains
"one of the busiest programs in
the country" and treats adults,
children and infants, Haft said. In
January, the hospital's ECLS Pro-
gram treated its 2,000th ECMO
patient, an infant named Victor,
he said.
Haft said he's proud the pro-
gram has grown to become what
he said is the largest ECMO
treatment program in the world.
Because of Bartlett's involve-
ment with the machine's creation,
the University has always been a
leaderi the field, Haft said.
Bartlett, a professor emeri-
tus of surgery at the University

Hospital, began experiments
to extend the use of the heart-
lung machine in the late 1960s.
He built several extracorporeal
devices in 1968 and 1969 at Boston
Children's Hospital and Harvard
Medical School.
Bartlett later took his research
to the School of Medicine at the
University of California, Irvine,
where he worked with other doc-
tors to use the ECMO machine on
clinical patients. He then brought
the program to the University
Hospital in 1980.
As ECMO became the standard
treatment for infants with certain
diagnoses, Bartlett said hospitals
around the world began develop-
ing their own ECMO programs,
and representatives coming to
the University Hospital during
the 1980s and 1990s for informa-
tion and training seminars. Now
almost every hospital associated
with a university has an ECMO
program, but medical profession-
als still reach out to UMHS for
assistance, Bartlett said.
"Michigan has been sort of the
fountainhead of this informa-
tion for all of its development,"
Bartlett said. "We have calls basi-
cally every week from hospitals
around the world."
These calls sometimes require
UMHS doctors to fly to other hos-
pitals to place patients on ECMO
on location or to bring them back
to Ann Arbor for treatment, Haft
said.

Ann Arbor also houses the
Extracorporeal Life Support
Organization, an international
society affiliated with the Uni-
versity that maintains a registry
of ECMO patients around the
world. Members of the organiza-
tion can submit data to the regis-
try and use it as a resource to look
up patient outcomes for quality
assurance and research purposes.
Though ECMO is most com-
monly used for infants, Haft said
UMHS also received frequent
inquiries from other hospitals
during the H1N1 virus epidem-
ic. During the outbreak, people
sought means to develop ECMO
programs for adults who were
suffering from respiratory fail-
ure.
Mason experienced a different
ECMO course than most due to
his birth defect, which required
him to receive treatment direct-
ly through the heart instead of
through a vein. Ellinger said he
was able to successfully come off
of ECMO after 18 days. She added
that while her son was on ECMO,
she was comforted by the level of
expertise the nurses and techni-
cians at the University Hospital
exhibited.
Now in preschool, Mason
doesn't have any ECMO-related
side effects and is only affected by
symptoms of his congenital birth
defect, Ellinger said.
"If you look at him now, you
wouldn't be able to tell," she said.


GOLDEN APPLE
From Page 1
Though Herzog's address was
titled the "Ideal Last Lecture,"
Herzog treated it as a typical
lecture during which he dis-
cussed women's rights, opening
with a couple lighthearted com-
ments about his teaching style.
"I haven't actually held a lec-
ture in about 30 years now, so
I printed this sort of Socratic
method Q and A, but you guys
haven't done all the reading. It's
a waste of time," he told the audi-
ence.
Students Honoring Outstand-
ing University Teaching, or
SHOUT, presented Herzog with
the Golden Apple Award - the
only student-bestowed award for
teaching at the University.
Herzog, a professor at the Uni-
versity since 1983, wrote in an
e-mail interview after the lecture
that the award was "impossibly
sweet."
"Teaching does matter, in a big
bad ferocious way, and it's a great
pleasure to think I may be doing
it well," Herzog wrote.
However, students entering
Herzog's classes shouldn't expect
to get an A without working hard.
"Professor Herzog truly elicits

the best of his students and the
best efforts of his students," Law
School Dean Evan Caminker
said in an interview after the
event.
Caminker said a former stu-
dent of Herzog once told him
that Herzog "made her think so
hard her brain constantly hurt."
LSA senior Joey Eisman,
chair of SHOUT, said during his,
speech introducing Herzog that
the process of selecting a pro-
fessor began in November and
culminated in hundreds of nom-
inations submitted in January.
"Golden Apple Award honors
those teachers who consistently
treat every lecture as if it were
their last time to disseminate
knowledge to his or her students
and engage each student to think
critically and inspire discourses
outside the classroom," Eisman
said.
Walker, who has taken two
classes from Herzog, said a major
reason she took a Law class
focusing on the First Amend-
ment was because Herzog was
the professor.
Rackham student Zev Berger,
who Herzog advises for his Ph.D.
candidate studies, said if this
were the last lecture he would
give, "he would do it just the
same."

Wisconsin unions rush deals
ahead of new bargaining law

Democratic Sec. of
State delays law's
publication
MADISON, Wis. (AP) -
School boards and local gov-
ernments across Wisconsin are
rushing to reach agreements
with unions before a new law
takes effect and erases their
ability to collectively bargain
over nearly all issues other than
minimal salary increases.
The law doesn't go into effect
until the day after Secretary
of State Doug La Follette pub-
lishes it and it doesn't super-
sede contracts already in place,
fueling unions' desire to reach
new deals quickly. La Follette
said yesterday that he will delay
publication until the latest day
possible, March 25, to give local
governments time to try to
reach agreements.
Republican Gov. Scott Walker
had asked La Follette to publish
the law yesterday, but the Dem-
ocratic secretary of state said he
didn't see any emergency that
warranted doing so. La Follette
opposed the bill and said he sat
in his office watching parts of a
weekend protest that brought as
many as 100,000 people out in
opposition to the law.
"This is the biggest change in
Wisconsin labor management
history in 50 years," La Follette
said, describing his reasoning
for holding off on its enactment.
The law ends collective bar-
gaining for public workers
over everything except salary
increases no greater than infla-
tion. It also forces state workers
to make benefit concessions that
amount to an 8 percent pay cut
on average.
Walker also is proposing a
nearly $1 billion cut in aid to
schools in his two-year budget
plan that would take effect in
July. He argued that for that
reason, districts need to get

more money from their employ-
ees to help mitigate the loss in
aid. Walker also wants to limit
the ability of schools and local
governments to pay for the
cuts through local property tax
increases.
The Wisconsin Associa-
tion of School Boards is telling
districts to be cautious about
approving contracts that will
make it more difficult for them
to handle Walker's proposed
cuts. Since Walker unveiled
the bill on Feb. 11, between 50
and 100 of the state's 424 dis-
tricts have approved deals with
unions, said Bob Butler, an
attorney with the association.
The vast majority of them
included benefit concessions
consistent with what Walker
proposed under the new collec-
tive bargaining law, Butler said.
The Madison school board
met in a marathon 18-hour ses-
sion Friday night to reach an
agreement with the local teach-
ers union to approve a new
contract that runs through mid-
2013.
That agreement freezes
wages and requires the same
pension contribution as state
workers will be required to pay
starting later this month under
the new law. It also allows the
district to require health insur-
ance premium contributions up
to 5 percent in the first year of
the deal and up to 10 percent in
the second year.
The Racine school district
voted to approve a new con-
tract with its teachers union on
Wednesday evening, as Walk-
er's collective bargaining pro-
posal was being approved by the
state Senate. Several local gov-
ernments, including the city of
Janesville and La Crosse Coun-
ty, also have pushed through
contracts in the past month
ahead of the new law.
A handful of counties have
reached deals with local unions
statewide, said John Rhineman,

legislative director of the Wis-
consin Counties Association.
Rhineman said county
boards want to reach deals in
advance of the law taking effect
because they want to work
together with their employees
who, in some cases, are seeking
contracts more generous than
what would be required under
the new law.
"Our people do care about
their employees," Rhineman
said. "Some of them feel the
bill has gone further than they
would choose to go."
Schools and local govern-
ments would be foolish to
rush through deals that don't
account for concessions at the
same level or greater than what
is called for under the law, said
Republican Rep. Robin Vos, co-
chairman of the Legislature's
budget committee.
If they don't get the conces-
sions, then they can't complain
about the difficulty of dealing
with cuts, Vos said.
"Ultimately they're the ones
who are going to have to deal
with the ramifications," he said.
"I can't imagine they're going to
be able to talk out of both sides
of their mouth."
If districts lock in deals with
unions that don't have conces-
sions to help make up for the
aid cuts, that could force them
into making "mass layoffs," said
Walker's spokesman Cullen
Werwie.
Eliminating collective bar-
gaining, except over salary, puts
both local teachers unions and
the school districts in unchar-
tered territory as they try to
figure out how to work with one
another without the previous
structure, said Mary Bell, presi-
dent of the statewide teachers'
union that fought unsuccess-
fully to stop the bill.
"This bill creates chaos and
that doesn't benefit anyone,"
Bell said. "There's a great deal
of anxiety, as you might expect."

The Rick choi ce
Snyder will be good, but he wasn't the best pick
t was going to be hard to find a commencement speak-
er to follow the president of the United States. Regard-
less of personal political views, having President Barack
Obama address the University's graduating class last spring
was a special honor. But since University President Mary Sue
Coleman couldn't bring the leader of the nation back to the
Big House, it's no surprise that she would ask the leader of the
state: newly inaugurated Republican Gov. Rick Snyder.

Don't pass over the patient

In her eight years at the University, Cole-
man has often invited major political fig-
ures to speak at commencement, including
Obama, former Democratic Gov. Jennifer
Granholm and former President Bill Clinton
in 2007. As the chief executive of the state,
Snyder is an obvious choice to help usher the
class of 2011 into life after college. He will
speak from a unique perspective as both a
businessman and a politician. But he will also
speak as someone who once sat where the
class of 2011 will be sitting, since he's an alum
who received his Bachelor in General Studies,
Masters of Business Administration and Juris
Doctorate from the University.
But what makes Snyder unique is that he
is a different kind of politician. Unlike most
elected officials, he went straight from his
CEO position at venture capital firm Ardesta,
LLC to Lansing. Instead of spending years
on the campaign trail delivering persuasive
speeches, Snyder promptly made the deci-
sion to run and was elected in one year. So it
wouldn't be surprising if instead of delivering
a typical political speech, Snyder spoke in a
more business-oriented tone.
It will probably be a good speech. Snyder
co-founded and ran a venture capital firm and
became the state's governor with virtually no
political experience. Clearly, Snyder knows
how to command all types of environments,

and will be able to utilize those skills when he
enters the Big House on April 30.
However, the irony of this commencement
speaker decision cannot be overlooked. Sny-
der has frequently discussed the importance
of education for the state's future. But when
it came time to allocate funding in the budget
he announced on Feb. 17, that message gotlost
in the translation, as his proposal included a
15 percent cut to higher education funding.
It's difficult to appreciate a commencement
speaker who wants to reduce funding for
the state's public universities by such a large
amount. While Snyder most likely won't focus
on that unfortunate reality for University stu-
dents, it will undoubtedly be on the minds of
non-graduates at the ceremony. How can Sny-
der motivate the class of 2011 when the class
of 2015 will enter the University with likely
raised tuition costs and potentially fewer
resources because of his budget?
Thus far, a lot of responses to the com-
mencement speaker announcement have
been less than enthusiastic. Many stu-
dents are upset about Snyder being invited.
There are four Facebook groups protesting
the decision. There is also a UPetition ask-
ing the University to reconsider Snyder for
commencement speaker that had more than
2,800 signatures as of midnight last night.
And it's difficult to blame them.

You're no longer likely to find
a couch in your psychiatrist's
office. That's because there's
no need for it
anymore. Most
psychiatrists no
longer provide
talk therapy. A
government sur-
vey from 2005
suggests that
only 11 percent
of psychiatrists MARY
actually provide DEMERY
the service, and
that number has
surely dwindled since.
That's not to say that psychia-
trists are no longer providing ser-
vices. After an initial 45-minute
evaluation, most psychiatrists will
prescribe medication and send the
patient on his way. In a few months,
the patient will come back in for a
15-minute check-up. Though by that
time, the psychiatrist will often have
forgotten the patient's symptoms
or even his name. Psychiatrists still
work with the mind, but now they
transfer that work to medicine.
Ironically, these shifts in psychiatry
direct the attention away from the
patient, the person who is supposed
to be of the utmost importance in
this practice.
The reasons for this are myriad
but are largely related to insurance.
Most insurance companies simply
will not pay the fees psychiatrists
were long accustomed to charging.
As a result, psychiatrists - many
still paying off student loans - had
to find other ways to make a profit.
They turned to an approach that
yields a high number of patients
and also relies on writing medica-
tions. Though this isn't what many
psychiatrists had in mind when they
entered the field, for the most part,
their business is no longer a deeply
personal one.
The key here is money. Psychia-

trists had to tweak their practice in
order to stay financially viable. In
effect, they chose profit over patient.
This is not to label all psychiatrists
as greedy or callous - the amount of
education they must pursue in order
to become doctors shows a level of
dedication that prohibits such dis-
missive labeling. But it's important
to note that psychiatry is no longer
a business interested in forming
relationships. Due to large patient
volume, psychiatrists often have
to remind their patients that they
aren't their therapists.
While it's true that psychiatry -
like any medicine, is abusiness - it's
also a field that deals with a very
personal and potentially powerful
organ: the mind. As such, the impor-
tance of profitability over patient
care seems especially sinister.
And this response ignores the
most important part ofthe process -
the patient. After all, when a patient
visits a psychiatrist's office, he's
often in some sortofserious distress.
Maybe it's depression or anxiety.
Maybe he's lonely. It often takes a
long time for such a state to develop.
Take depression, for instance. You
don't become depressed overnight.
It's an illness that takes a long time
to develop. The converse is true,
too: Depression doesn't disappear
overnight. Prescribing medications
without any long-term follow-up is
evading the real problem. In a psy-
chologist's office, on the other hand,
without the crux medicine often
provides, patients are forced to actu-
ally work out their issues.
But how does the patient feel
about this? The question can't be
answered without considering
another one: What does the patient
hope to get from psychiatry? Hap-
piness? The ability to thrive once
more? Or does the patient simply
hope to function again? As it stands,
psychiatry seems to answer the
last question. And this seems like a

pretty low expectation, especially
when you consider just how pow-
erful medication can be - in some
cases, it can create imbalance, side
effects or dependency (though for
many, the medications do succeed in
pulling the patient's mind back to a
functioning, healthy level). Psychia-
trists often attempt to direct their
patientsto therapyvia a psychologist
or therapist, but few patients follow
through. The drugs are a quick fix,
and many patients would rather not
spend the additional money on see-
ing a psychologist or therapist.
Psychiatrists are
choosing profits
over patients.
This shift in psychiatry asks for
a tremendous amount of trust from
patients without much account-
ability on the psychiatrist's side.
Because psychiatrists are burdened
with such a high number of patients,
it's hard for them to remember
names, let alone symptoms or life
stories. Though psychiatrists maybe
important figures in many patients'
lives, that relationship can no longer
transfer to the psychiatrist. It's hard
to build a relationship with someone
you only see once every few months
for 15-minute intervals. Multiply
that by a thousand people and you'll
see what sort of odds the. psychia-
trist is working with.
-In directing their patients toward
medication, psychiatristsgive up any
personal stake in the patient's well-
being. If the medicationworks, that's
great. But if it doesn't, it certainly
won't devastate the psychiatrist.

and wish to recognize the faculty
and staff who have made their aca-
demic experience so great to nomi-
nate their departments for the LSA
Departmental Award of Excellence
by going to http://goo.gl/OoNJJ by
Sunday, March 20 and completing a
short survey.
For those of you who have not
declared, the LSA Concentration
Fair is tomorrow, Wednesday, March
16 and is the perfect venue to learn all
about your future major or minor. As
I have mentioned in a previous col-
umn, U.S. News and World Report
stated that for 2010, 67 LSA depart-
ments are in the top 10, and nine
school departments ranked number
one in the country, but it's up to you
to find which top-ranked program
works for you. Believe it or not, there
is more to choosing your concentra-
tion than just focusing on your aca-
demic interests. Departments can
serve you as communities, as career
connectors and in other capacities.
Different departments have differ-
ent strengths and weaknesses, and
consequently, you should speak with
people from each concentration you
are considering to determine if their
resources and focus fit with your

expectations. There are several ques-
tions you might consider asking when
approaching department representa-
tives at the LSA Concentration Fair.
Some departments feature com-
mittees and student clubs, which
allow concentrators to become more
integrated with the curriculum and
events that occur each semester.
Departments that provide students
with opportunities to reflect and
engage with the direction of the
courses and class work are great
starting points for enriching the col-
lege experience. Many students who
serve on advisory boards, curricu-
lum committees and event planning
bodies report a better experience in
their department. The more you can
give to your department, the more
you will get out of your time with
professors and fellow concentrators
in your department, both in and out-
side the classroom.
Different departments handle
advising in different ways, and
before you declare, you should speak
with advisers. Many departments
have staff specifically responsible for
guiding you through your time with
the concentration, who canbe excel-
lent people to speak with about core
requirements and career opportu-
nities. Some units in LSA have peer
advisers. Serving as a peer adviser
can be an excellent job opportunity
and way to give back to your concen-
tration, but alsohelp you understand
your concentration experience in
the context of your larger LSA and
University experience. Departments
that invest resources in advising are
great sources for personal develop-
ment throughout your time as an
undergraduate.
You should also inquire about
research opportunities in your
department. Not only can research
be a great way to delve deeper into
topics you are academically inter-
ested in, but it can also be a source
of community and work experience.
Concentrations that feature agreater
number of research projects demon-

strate a clear commitment to under-
graduate involvement in advancing
the field.
In addition to reflecting on these
topics, you can go online to LSA's
website to get more information
about each concentration. I encour-
age you to go to each department's
website if you are interested in
learning more about your poten-
tial concentration(s). Again, getting
information from the Concentration
Fair and websites is important, butbe
sure to talk with the key stewards of
your department to get the best per-
spective about what your time with
the department will be like.
Find your
department at
the LSA fair.
Some departments spend incred-
ible time and energy bringing
concentrators together outside of
the classroom. In selecting your
concentration(s),lookbeyond the ele-
mentary questions about your ability
to take your knowledge and turn it
into a job. LSA is about more than
preparing for the "real world," it's
about getting a well-rounded experi-
ence that will help you in all aspects
of life. For more information about
concentrations, and how to select
the correct one(s) for you, come to
the LSA Concentration Fair anytime
from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Wednesday
on the second floor of the Michigan
League. For a more complete list of
questions and topics to discuss with
department representatives, visit

Seniors leave Yost on 13-game home winning streak

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
When the crowd at Yost Ice
Arena spelled out "C-H-A-R-
L-I-E S-H-E-E-N" midway
through the third period on Sat-
urday, it wasn't
just blowing NOTEBOOK
smoke in refer-
ence to a current pop-culture
phenomenon.
The student section finished
the chant by belting Sheen's
now-familiar catchphrase,
"winning," just minutes before
the No. 5 Michigan hockey team
capped off its home finale, a 4-1
victory over Bowling Green.
The only real difference is
that Charlie Sheen has been
winning for two weeks - the
Wolverines have been winning
at Yost for four straight months.
Saturday's victory marked
exactly four months since the
Wolverines last lost at home -
a 3-1 loss to then-No. 11 Notre
Dame. Since then, Michigan
has won 13 consecutive games
at Yost, finishing with a sterling
16-2-1 home record.
"You couldn't play in front of
better fans than Michigan hock-
ey fans," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said. "No matter what
kind of weather it is out, no mat-
ter what's going on around the
sporting world ... they find their
way here, they're behind the
team, they give them support. If
you can't play hockey here, you
can't play anywhere.
"Someday they'll replace this
building, but they won't replace

For the seniors, participat-

As it turns out, the Wolverines
probably would have received an

they had lost to the Fighting Illi-
ni. But at the time, conventional
wisdom said Michigan needed
a win to ensure its place in the
tourney.
Down 12 points with just over
eight minutes to play, it appeared
that the Wolverines would be
sweating out Selection Sun-
day. But they buckled down on
defense, allowing Illinois to score
just four points the rest of the
way.
Michigan's late-game charge

ment berth - something nobody
expected before the season.

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team was sitting on the
precocious edge of the NCAA
tournament bubble, unsure of its
future but still optimistic. After
all, the Wolverines finished third
in the Big Ten after winning a
three-way tiebreaker. And more
often than not, the top five teams
in the Big Ten make the tourna-
ment.
But the bubble burst on Mon-
day, as Michigan was left out of
the NCAA Tournament for the
11th straight year. The Wolver-
ines had enough big wins on their
resume to be in consideration, but
in the end, it was their key losses
that came back to haunt them.
Michigan coach Kevin Bors-
eth was unavailable for comment
after the tournament field was
announced.
Early in the season, Michi-
gan (10-6 Big Ten, 17-12 overall)
lost to Detroit Mercy (6-11 in the
Horizon League) at home and to
Big Ten bottom-feeder Minne-
sota. The most important loss,
though, was in the conference
tournament.
After receiving a first-round
bye, the Wolverines seemed to
catch a break when Illinois, the
last seed, upset No. 6 seed Wis-
consin. Everything looked to be
falling into place for Michigan,
as a win against the Fighting
Illini would essentially guaran-
tee them a shot to go dancing in
March.
. The Wolverines were expect-
ed to roll over Illinois, but they
fell hard instead, 55-47, after

scoring just 16 points in the first
half. They shot 27 percent from
the floor in the first half, includ-
ing 13 percent from the perim-
eter, and dug themselves into an
insurmountable hole.
Even after a disappointing
showing, Borseth was still more
optimistic than expected.
"Do we have a chance to play
in the postseason? We do. What
are our chances? Good," Borseth
said after the game. "Tomorrow
the sun's goingto shine and we're
going to pick up the pieces and
get an opportunity to play some-
where down the road and forget
abouttoday."
And why shouldn't he have
been optimistic? The Big Ten
had five teams make the NCAA
Tournament, and Michigan held
a 4-4 record against those teams.
Perhaps more impressive was the
Wolverines sweep of Ohio State,
a team that went on to eventu-
ally win the Big Ten Tournament
and grab a No. 4 seed in the big
dance.
Those impressive wins had
Michigan predicted as a No. 10
seed, according to ESPN's Char-
lie Creen. Even though Michigan
was on the bubble, the feeling
surrounding the team was posi-
tive.
Instead, Michigan will not
break its streak of missed tourna-
ment appearances, as it willprob-
ably be a high seed in the WNIT
tournament favored to make a
deep run.
The bubble under Michigan's
tournament hopes has burst,
leaving the team to pick up the
pieces in time to contend for a
WNIT title.

The more the merrier

'Somewhere' soars

Hollywood franchises
are a quintessential
part of our understand-
ing of the film industry and are
key to its current and future
states. Char-
acterized by
big-budget
sequels,
franchises
connect K
audiences
to previous
experiences ANKUR
without the SOHONI
financial risk
associated
with original concepts.
Disney is the master fran-
chiser - the studio's success is
not simply a product of hit films,
but rather of visionary concepts
and characters that can be taken
in every direction.
My own interaction with Hol-
lywood's commercial focus on
franchises is typical: I am a rabid
consumer of the familiar, ready
and willing to interact with char-
acters I've already met and sto-
ries I've been told before. Going
to the movies hasn't always been
about discovering originality, but
often becomes a hunt for comfort
in the blanket of the past.
That's been a very simple
strategy for a long time - for
the past 30 years, Hollywood
has had ultimate power to cre-
ate and continue film franchises
by bastardizing the original and
releasing comically low-effort
sequels. Audiences have con-

sumed sequels like mad, myself
included, because audiences are
remarkably comfortable with
what they've already seen.
A new polar studio strategy
that pushes production toward
either super-low or epically-high
budgets while losing the middle
ground stands to create a film
industry that emphasizes fran-
chises more than ever.
The five highest-grossing films
of last year exemplify that. At the
top was "Toy Story 3," the con-
clusion of an animated film series
emphasizingnostalgia and the
fleetingnature of youth. Second:
"Alice in Wonderland," a re-
imagining ofthe classic tale with
which almost every age group
is already familiar. In third and
fourth: "Iron Man 2" and "The
Twilight Saga: Eclipse," respec-
tively - one a typical sequel
tryingto one-up the size of the
original and the other a book saga
adaptation feeding on the raven-
ous tastes of teenagers. The fifth
place film comes from the fran-
chise of all franchises, "Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hallows:
Part I"- essentially the surest of
sure bets.
Thinking beyond simple the-
atrical grosses, though, consider
the cost of producing so many of
these installments. In most cases,
cost is never recovered on theat-
rical release alone. The attraction
of franchises isn't simply that
their films will make box office
money. It's that they will make
money, create obsession, branch

out across mediums and con-
sumer goods and make more and
more money long after the film's
release.
I have "Lord of the Rings" and
"Avatar" calendars in my bed-
room. No matter how much Ilike
"The King's Speech" or "Black
Swan," they won't inspire fandom
like that.
But franchises now aren't nec-
essarily like franchises of decades
past. Before, sequelswere univer-
sally inferior to their originals,
lost in tryingto recreate an exist-
ing story but characterizedby

consistent failure. In a risk-averse,
recession-minded film industry,
sequels like "The Dark Knight,"
"The Bourne Supremacy" and
"Toy Story 3" are the goal. These
films not only increase the size of

pursue entirely different courses
in plot and thematic focus.
While sequels may still tend to
disappoint, there is more hope for
these films than Hollywood has
ever seen.
In conjunction with those
expectations, blockbuster

Coppola's latest
creation sinks in
with patience
By JENNIFER XU
Senior Arts Editor

Ah, "Somewhere" - the
neglected stepchild of 2010. Upon
winning a Golden Lion at the
Venice Film
Festival, Sofia
Coppola's
("LostinTrans- Somewhere
lation") latest
film amassed At the Michigan
Oscar buzzfor
the entirety of Focus
three seconds,
before being promptly set off to
the side, forgotten.
Perhaps it's because nothing
ever seems to happen in the film.
One of its openingscenes presents
three minutes of the waiflike Cleo
(Ele Fanning, "The Curious Case
of Benjamin Button") ice-skating
in a blue dress - nothing else.
No cuts away, no stuntwork. But
there's a strangely mesmerizing,
almost hypnotic quality follow-
ing Cleo's every move, every bent
knee. Her father, the jaded actor
Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff,
"Public Enemies"), looks up from
his phone and it hits him what a
flower his adolescent daughter has
blossomed into - a ball of loneli-
ness and pride wrapped into one.
Where "Somewhere" succeeds
exquisitely is in communicat-
ing the language of temporal-
ity. Much of the film takes place
inside the luscious, opulent Cha-
teau Marmont Hotel - a lan-
guorous playground of a celebrity
haunt where sin goes to bed with
melancholy. In French, chateau
means castle, and the term evokes
a contained, Old World hollow-
ness in which the kings have all

died or become irrelevant.
Indeed, everything is synthetic
here at the palace of the lost souls,
even people. Marco, a Hollywood
actor trapped in the perpetual
state of waiting, falls asleep in
the midst of watching a soporific
striptease starringtwo bombshell
blonde-headed pole dancers. He
falls asleep again later that night,
this time while administering
oral sex to a different leggy young
thing. When his daughter, the tall,
willowy 12-year-old Cleo, decides
to stay with him, Johnny needs
to reprioritize. Cleo, more fairy
sprite than an actual girl, brings
to Johnny's isolated universe a
mystical world of underwater tea
parties and room-service pan-
cakes.
Critics may deride Coppola's
range. Why can't she move on
from her comfortable cocoon
of navel gazing to something a
smidge more dynamic? We want
action, excitement, they cry. But
the static, almost therapeutic
ambienceworksfor"Somewhere,"
and whatever is left unsaid
unlocks a chasm of introspection.
It's minimalism at its finest: The

empty spaces are literally empty
spaces. There are scenes seething
with past memories of loneliness,
repression, wanderlust - scenes
that recall many a film in the
Coppola discourse: Lux Lisbon's
lace collared dress blowing in the
wind, Charlotte's light pink briefs
cradling her heart-shaped derri-
ere, Marie Antoinette's toppling
pile of shoes, bouffants and bon-
bons.
"Somewhere" might only strike
a chord among a select few, but
for the patient, it can open petal
by petal (to slightly rephrase ee
cunimings) an entire world. A
silky tone poem saturated with'
an ennui as thick as the foggy,
smoggy hills of Los Angeles,
"Somewhere" bubbles with the
most stirring ontological ques-
tions: What is real anymore? With
all of the modern age's reflective
surfaces and transient promises
of fame, how do we find the thing
that is genuinely authentic? We
can go from womb to tomb with-
out ever touching the essential
qualities of existence - but some-
how, "Somewhere" can bring us
closer to them.

been exceedingly vocal about his
label's stranglehold on his cre-

INTERNET INSTRUMENTS
From the ' to YouTube
Cellist and student Madeline Huberth isb
heading to Sydney with a virtual orchestra
By Joe Cadagin I Daily Fine Arts Editor

With a matter of clicks, visi-
tors to YouTube are sucked into a
terrifying vortex of finger-biting
babies, auto-tuned politicians,
scooter-riding dogs and hip-
shaking gummy bears. Yet in the
midst of this ever-changing hur-
ricane of viral videos, Internet
surfers can find relief in a bea-
con of high culture that shines
steadily in the cyber ocean: the
YouTube Symphony Orchestra.
This week, musicians from across
the globe - including University
cellist Madeline Huberth - will
gather at the Sydney Opera House
to perform as part of the 2011
YouTube Symphony Orchestra.
Conceived in 2008, the
ensemble combines elements of
a traditional orchestra with the
interactive quality and interna-
tional scope of YouTube. Instead
of a traditional orchestral audi-
tion, members upload a video of
themselves playing two pieces.
After a panel of judges nar-
rows the contestants to a group
of finalists, the entire YouTube
community is invited to vote for
the official winners.
For the first YouTube Sym-
phony Orchestra in 2009, win-
ners from 23 different countries
traveled to Carnegie Hall to
perform under maestro Michael
Tilson Thomas, who also serves
as director of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra. This year,
Tilson Thomas will return to lead
the second orchestra, this time in
sunny Sydney, Australia at the
iconic Sydney Opera House.
For cellist Madeline Huberth,
a dual-enrolled senior in LSA and
the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance, auditioning via the Web

was an intriguing prospect.
"It seemed like it was almost a
too-good-to-be-true opportuni-
ty, that you just upload a video to
YouTube and then it's completely
out of your hands," Huberth said.
"A lot of application processes
can be a deterrent because you
have to fly somewhere to audi-
tion and you have to buy a seat
for your cello on the plane. This
didn't have any of those problems
- I just set up the camera in my
dorm room and made my audi-
tion tape."
Huberth, who hails from
Monroe, New York, is pursuing
a degree in cello performance
with MT&D Prof. Richard Aaron.
She has performed in a variety of
traditional orchestras - includ-
ing the University Symphony
Orchestra and the Lansing Sym-
phony Orchestra - but none of
these ensembles required a web-
cam audition. In fact, Hubert
admitted she rarely visited the
YouTube site before her audition.
What most attracted Huberth
to the project was the allure of
working with Grammy Award-
winning conductor Michael Til-
sonThomas- nicknamed"MTT"
in the music world. Huberth first
encountered Tilson Thomas in
March of 2009 when he toured
to Ann Arbor with the San Fran-
cisco Symphony Orchestra.
"I wanted to work with MTT
- that was one of the big draws,"
Huberth said. "He gave a master
class (at the University) last year.
He worked with the student con-
ductors here, and the University
Symphony Orchestra played for
the student conductors. But there
was one point where he came up

production, which dilutes Lupe's
powerful message. He calls
out people from both sides of
the political spectrum rapping,
"Limbaugh is a racist / Glenn
Beck is a racist / Gaza strip was
getting bombed / Obama didn't
say shit."
"All Black Everything" is
another fascinating glimmer of
old-school Lupe, as it has him
imagining a world that isn't
blightedbyracism. Hedropsafew
politically charged names from
history as well as riffing on politi-
cal figures in recent news, subse-
quently crafting an ideal world
where "Everybody rappin' like
crack never happened." A utopi-
an, "Pleasantville"-esque orches-
tra reminiscent of a '50s sitcom

strains, while Lupe dreams about
a world where "hip hop ain'tgot a
section called conscious."
There are a few instances on
the album when Lupe breaks
free of the chains he raps about
on the track "The Show Goes
On," (which utilizes a Modest
Mouse sample to create a solid
anthem for the downtrodden and
kicked-around). HoweverLasers
is plagued by generic beats and
lazy lyricism.
To stir up attention for the
album, Lupe released "The
Lasers Manifesto" in which he
boldly proclaimed, "We want
substance in the place of popu-
larity. We will not compromise
who we are to be accepted by the
crowd." Unfortunately - though
a sizable chunk of the blame fell
on his record company's shoul-
ders - Lupe Fiasco failed to fol-
low his own rules on Lasers.

Huberth is excited to work with Grammy winner Michael Tilson Thomas.


to the podium for like, ten minutes
and conducted us, and it felt awe-
some. So when I saw his name on
the YouTube Symphony (website),
I thought this is something I real-
ly wantto get a chance to do."
After rigorous rehearsing,
Huberth submitted her audition
videos last November - includ-
ing one of her playing an excerpt
from a symphony by Brahms, her
favorite composer. To her delight,
Huberth received a call early
last month informing her of her
acceptance into the orchestra.
Huberth, who has an affinity
for dangerous species, is looking
forward to seeing some of the
snakes, sharks and spiders who
make their home down under.
She is also relieved that YouTube
is paying for her cello's airfare
to Australia besides her own.
The cellist said that what she is
anticipating most, however, is the
opportunity to meet the diverse
members of this year's orchestra,
who come from 33 countries and
range from teenagers to profes-
sional musicians and professors.
"It seems like there's going
to be enough time there to get

to know each other," Huberth
said. "I think they're trying to
leave time for us to play chamber
music together or explore the city
together. So I would say that I'm
especially looking forward to get-
ting to know some of these people,
especially since they come from
such broad backgrounds."
After a series of sectional con-
certs this week, the YouTube
Symphony's "season" will culmi-
nate with a gala concert featuring
the entire orchestra on Sunday.
The concert will be streamed
live on YouTube and eventually
uploaded as a permanent video.
Huberth is optimistic that the
affiliation with YouTube will
help the orchestra to attract new
converts to classical music.
"I think, right now, the You-
Tube Symphony Orchestra has
a particular place in the music
climate," she said. "I would hope
that by getting more eyes on
music that typically wouldn't be
on music, then those eyes would
wander into their local sympho-
nies ... It'll spark more interest in
the arts - that's actually one of its
missions. That's my hope for it."

generate even further excite-
ment. Christopher Nolan is the
best example: The new "Bat-
man" saga is essentially his, and
unlike Tim Burton's 1980s-1990s
"Batman" films, it seems widely
understood that the series
couldn't work without him.
J.J. Abrams, with TV suc-
cesses in "Lost" and "Alias," was
hired to helm "Mission: Impos-
sible 3," and then given the reins
of the reinvigorated "Star Trek."
Hiringdirectors like Dar-
ren Aronofsky ("Black Swan,"
"Requiem for a Dream") for the
next "Wolverine" film and Rob
Marshall ("Chicago," "Memoirs
of a Geisha") for "Pirates of the
Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"
shows a concerted effort by stu-
dios to maintain quality even far
into franchises. Or, at the very
least, it illustrates their desire to
seem that way (don't forget Marc
Forster, director of "Finding Nev-
erland" and "Monster's Ball," was
at the head of the painful Bond

flick "Quantum of Solace").
Many people find trends like
the ones described here to be
worrisome - not only is Hol-
lywood becoming more and
more top-heavy, it's taking its
Oscar-nominated directors and
corrupting them with sellout
tentpole ideology.
ButI tend to lean the other
way. Franchise pictures become
social capital, and more than
simple commercial endeavors.
Investing talent into those films
could result in more well-made
sequels, as we've seen in the past
five years. Bringingthis genera-
tion's critically acclaimed film-
makers into the big blockbuster
production mode represents the
next step in Hollywood com-
merce and brings the chance for
a new kind of blockbuster. While
there may be no formula for a
great sequel, Hollywood seems
ready to at least attempt mak-
ing franchises that endure with
dignity.
