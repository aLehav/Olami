SACUA considering
changing election
procedures for DPS
oversight committee
By ANNIE GORDON THOMAS
Daily StaffReporter
The University's leading fac-
ulty governance body discussed
holding faculty elections for the
Department of Public Safety's
Oversight Com-
mittee at its NOTEBOOK
weekly meeting
yesterday.
Members of the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs discussed how to seek
nominations and how to conduct
the voting process for the faculty's
two seats on the DPS Oversight
Committee - an organization
meant to keep tabs on University
Police and investigate grievances
filed with the organization. On
average, the group reviews two
grievances a year.
The committee recently has
come under fire for the question-
able election procedures used to
elect committee members and
apparent non-compliance with

some of the state statutes meant
to guide the group's activities.
SACUA members reviewed
how they hope to elect faculty
members to the two faculty posi-
tions on the committee. The
talks included how theycwould
go about nominating *candidates
to be elected to the committee,
how faculty would be able to vote
and whether'write-in candidates
would be allowed.
Some of members of SACUA
expressed concern about whether
faculty members would really be
familiar with candidates on the
ballot, instead suggesting that
a blurb or picture be published
with each candidate's name.
However, other SACUA mem-
bers- said publishing an online
University Record article detail-
ing each candidate's background
would likely solve the problem.
SACUA members hope to start
the nominating process by early
next week, though such action is
contingent upon authorization
from Timothy Slottow, executive
vice president and chief financial
officer for the University. Slot-
tow is also the executive officer
responsible for the oversight
committee.
SACUA members said they

When NCAA President Myles

ning for the position.
"I can tell you definitively, I am
not a candidate," Coleman said.

For Kaz Soong, an ophthalmol-

earthquake in Haiti affected him

on a personal level.
Soong had visited Haiti twice
before, where he made close
friends and fell in love with the

knew he had to go back to help
the victims of the 7.0-magnitude

"I had to go," Soong said in an

to look for my friends and also to
help out with the carnage down

there. And time was ticking very,
very fast."
On Friday, Jan. 22, Soong flew

If signed by gov., ban
would make texting
behind the wheel a
secondary offense
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily StaffReporter
State legislators are in the pro-
cess of finalizing legislation to
ban drivers from texting while
operating their vehicles.
The bill, which was recently
WEATHER Hi: 33
TOMORROW LO 21

passed by both the Michigan
House of Representatives and the
Michigan Senate, would outlaw
the use of cell phones for read-
ing or drafting text messages or
e-mails while driving.
Under the law, texting or
e-mailing would be a secondary
offense, meaning that the driver
would only be ticketed for texting
after first being pulled over for
another offense like speeding.
Before the legislation can
become law,the House and Senate
need to agree on a final version of
the bill to send to Democratic Gov.

Jennifer Granholm for approval.
State Rep. Lee Gonzales
(D-Flint) introduced the bill to
the House largely because of how
the issue has impacted him on a
personal level.
Gonzales said in an interview
last week that his daughter-in-law
was driving to work one morning,
and while slowing in a construc-
tion zone, was rear-ended by a
woman dialing her phone, total-

For Brenda Gunderson,
teaching statistics at the
University of Michigan
appeared almost inevitable
from the moment she set
foot on campus as a gradu-
ate student in 1986 to pur-
sue a Ph.D.
Now, more than two
decades after completing
her degree, Gunderson, a
senior lecturer in Statistics,
teaches the 1,500 students
enrolled in Statistics 350 in
the position she describes
as her "dream job."
Citing a deep passion for
the field of statistics and a
desire to teach, Gunderson
said she began her teach-
ing career immediately
afte graduate school in
Ann Arbor. And though
Gunderson has spent the
majorityofhercareer atthe
CRIME NOTES

University coordinating
Stats 350, she has remained
relentless in refining the
course, from its curricu-
lum to its unique grading
system - which provides
students the option to drop
their two semester exams
entirely and have their
final exam score determine
the test component of their
final grade.
"Something that I pride
myself on is that we have
a fairly organized class
and the students can find
the materials they need,"
Gunderson said. "We try to
provide the students with
many opportunities to suc-
ceed."
In addition to her senior
lecturer post, Gunderson
also advises undergradu-
ate students who choose

to take statistics courses.
Though many students
who enroll in her course
are not necessarily statis-
tics majors, Gunderson
advises undergraduates
to continue the subject by
taking more courses and
to pursue a minor if they so
wish.
"I think that every stu-
dent should take a statis-
tics course at some point
in order to be quantita-
tively literate and know
what news that is out there
is worth listening to,"
Gunderson said.
Though Gunderson
remains extremely pas-
sionate about her work in
statistics and her future
endeavors for her course,
which include further
integrating technology to

enhance the learning expe-
rience, she insists that stu-
dents have been the main
reason she's continued
toenjoy teaching.
Gunderson said that
accepting the Golden
Apple award she received
from her students in 1999
was her most meaningful
achievement, adding that
she is extremely grate-
ful for everything that her
teaching career has pro-
vided.I
"The students make the
difference," Gunderson
said. "I have good days and
I have some days that don't
go as well, but I love work-
ing with the students and

Gov candidates
battle for campaign
fundraising dollars
Republicans Rick Snyder and
Mike Cox are leading the field in
fundraising in the Michigan gover-
nor's race, according to 2009 cam-
paign reports filed yesterday with
the secretary of state's office.
Snyder, an Ann Arbor venture
capitalist, collected $3.2 million,
including $2.6 million from his own
pocket. But Snyder burned through
far more cash than anyone else in
the race, spending $1.9 million, leav-
ing him with $1.4 million on hand at
the end of December.
He had around 1,000 contribu-
tors and plans to begin running the
first ads of the 2010 gubernatorial
campaign during Sunday's Super
Bowl game.
Attorney General Cox raised
$1.8 million, including $40,137 that
he moved over from his attorney
general campaign fund. He spent
$362,760, leaving him with nearly
$1.5 million on hand.
The Wayne 11th Congressional
District Republican Committee gave
Cox $31,000 and Sen. Bruce Patter-
son's Commander's Majority Fund
gave $34,000. He had more than
2,300 donors, many of them small
contributors who gave $250 or less.

Jon Lacina hasn't been seen

China to U.S.:
Don't meet with
Dalai Lama
China warned President Barack
Obama today not to meef the Dalai
Lama, saying any such meeting
would harm bilateral relations.
An Obama meeting with the Dalai
Lama would "seriously undermine
the political foundation of Sino-U.S.
relations," said Zhu Weiqun, execu-
tive deputy head of the Communist
Party's United Front Work Depart-
ment in charge of recent talks with

the exiled Tibetan leader's envoys.
Zhu was speaking at a news con-
ference where he said no progress
had been made at the talks with
envoys of the Dalai Lama on chang-
es to the Himalayan region's status.
The warning to Obama comes
after signals from U.S. officials in
recent weeks that Obama might
soon meet the exiled Tibetan
leader - something Chinese offi-
cials are keen to avoid before
President Hu Jintao travels to
Washington, possibly in April.

The attack was the third major

that extremists are adopting new
methods to outwit bomb-detection
squads such as stashing explosives
deep inside the engines and frames

new tactics came last week from the

Defense Dept. to
begin study on
gays in military

Senate staff member Sam Armocido stacks copies of President Barack Obama's $3.83 trillion budget delivered to the Senate

Secretary Gates
announces study
into reversing 'Don't
Ask, Don't Tell'
WASHINGTON (AP) - Defense
Secretary Robert Gates today will
take the firstreal steps toward lift-
ing the ban on gays serving openly
in the military, announcing a year-
long review aimed at answering
practical and emotional questions
about the effect of lifting the ban,
and imposing looser standards for
enforcing the ban in the mean-
time.
According to U.S. officials,
the senior-level study will be co-
chaired by a top-ranked civilian
and a senior uniformed officer. It
would recommend the best way to
go about lifting the ban, starting
from the premise that it will take
time to accomplish that goal but
that it can be done without harm-
ing the capabilities or cohesion of
the military force, officials said.
The officials spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity to describe the
emerging Pentagon plan ahead of
Gates' announcement.
While the review is likely to take
a year to complete, and even more
time to implement, its initiation will
advance President Barack Obama's
goal of repealing the ban and bring
a divisive issue for the military and
Congress back to the fore.
Gates will testify before the Sen-
ate on the issue, alongside Adm.
Mike Mullen, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. Both were
expected to make their most far-
reaching statements on the ban
widely known as "don't ask, don't
tell."
"I think you'll see efforts on a
number of fronts over the course of
the next many months ... to address
what the president promised,"
White House press secretary Rob-
ert Gibbs said.
One U.S. official said Gates and
Mullen will outline a more lenient
standard for enforcing the current

ban, as Gates had said last year he
would consider. The interim policy
would make it harder for a third
party to turn in a gay service mem-
ber and would raise the standard
for evidence that the service mem-
ber is gay before the person could
be dismissed.
Under the 1993 law, engaging in
homosexual conduct - even if you
don't tell anyone - can been enough
to qualify a person for dismissal. The
law was intended as a compromise
betweenPresidentBill Clinton,who
wanted to lift the military's ban on
gays entirely, and a reluctant Con-
gress and military thatsaid doing so
would threaten order.
David Hall, a former Air Force
sergeant, said he was discharged in
2002 after someone else reported
that he was gay.
"That ended it," said Hall, who
now works for a gay rights advo-
cacy group. "Just like that, based
off what one person said, ended my
dream of getting to fly planes."
Repeal of the ban has been
opposed by some senior mem-
bers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and by some reluctant congres-
sional Democrats, including Rep.
Ike Skelton, D-Mo. The ban was
among topics planned to be dis-
cussed Monday during a meeting
of the top uniformed members of
each service.
"The chiefs owe the president
their best advice on the impact
of appeal and how it would be
implemented," said Capt. John
Kirby, a spokesman for the Joint
Chiefs.
Last year, the Defense Depart-
ment dismissed the fewest number
of service members for violating its
"don't ask, don't tell" policy than it
had in more than a decade.
According to figures released
by the Pentagon on Monday, 428
service members in 2009 were dis-
missed for being openly gay com-
pared with 619 in 2008. In 1997, 997
service members were dismissed.
The number fluctuated over the
next decade, with fewer troops dis-
charged after the war in Afghani-
stan began.

Deficit expected to
reach new record of
$1.56 trillion
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama sent Congress
a $3.83 trillion budget yesterday
that would pour more money into
the fight against high unemploy-
ment, boost taxes on the wealthy
and freeze spending for a wide
swath of government programs.
The deficit for this year would
surge to a record-breaking $1.56
trillion, topping last year's then
unprecedented $1.41 trillion gap.
The deficit would remain above $1
trillion in 2011 although the presi-
dent proposed to institute a three-
year budget freeze on a variety of
programs outside of the military
and homeland security as well as
increasingtaxes on energy produc-
ers and families making more than
$250,000.
Echoing the pledge in his State
of the Union address to make job
creation his top priority, Obama
put forward a budget that includ-
ed a $100 billion jobs measure
that would provide tax breaks to
encourage businesses to boost hir-
ing as well as increased govern-
ment spending on infrastructure
and energy projects. He called for
fast congressional action to speed
relief to millions leftunemployed in
the worst recession since the 1930s.

After a protracted battle on
health care dominated his first
year in office and led to a string of
Democratic election defeats, the
administration hopes its new bud-
get will convince Americans the
president is focused on fixing the
economy.
Republicans complained about
Obama's proposed tax increases
and said the huge projected defi-
cits showed he had failed to get
government spending under con-
trol. But administration officials
argued that Obama inherited a
deficit that was already topping
$1 trillion when he took office and
given the severity of the down-
turn, the president had to spend
billions of dollars stabilizing the
financial system and jump-start-
ing growth.
Obama's job proposals would
push government spending in 2010
to $3.72 trillion, up 5.7 percent
from last year. Obama's blueprint
for the 2011 budget year, which
begins Oct. 1, would increase
spending further to $3.83 trillion,
3 percenthigher than projected for
this year.
Muchofthe spendingsurge over
the past two years reflects the cost
of the $787 billion economic stimu-
lus measure that Congress passed
in February 2009 to deal with the
worst economic downturn since
the Great Depression. The surge
in the deficits reflects not only the
increased spending but also a big

drop in tax revenues, reflecting the
7.2 million people who have lost
jobs since the recession began and
weaker corporate tax receipts.
"Having steered the economy
back from the brink of a depres-
sion, the administration is com-
mitted to moving the nation from
a recession to recovery by spark-
ing job creation to get millions
of Americans back to work," the
administration said in a statement
accompanying its budget.
The administration's $100 bil-
lion proposed jobs measure would
be lower than a $174 billion bill
passed by the House in December
but far higher than a measure that
the Senate could take up as early as
this week.
Obama's new budget attempts
to navigate between the opposing
goals of pulling the country out of a
deep recession and getting control
of runaway budget deficits.

Ttyl cnt txt now
State must start PR campaign to stop texting while driving
t takes only three seconds of distraction to cause 80 percent
of accidents, according to a 2006 study by the Virginia Tech
Transportation Institute and National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. And most text messages take longer than three sec-
onds to type. Text messaging is a dangerous distraction on the road,
where conditions and threats change suddenly. The Michigan Sen-
ate recently passed a pair of bills that will ban texting while driving.
While the bill is an important measure, the state should combat this
dangerous habit with an exhaustive statewide media campaign to
make people aware of the consequences of driving while texting.

SpmCot
w e d u r e m C o rt v 'i ' e P o pl

Michigan will soon join the 28 states
that currently have a partial or total ban
on texting while driving. Michigan State
Senate Bill 402, passed on Jan. 29, will
make texting while driving a secondary
offense. Police officers will not be able to
pull over an alleged texting driver. But if
drivers pulled over for other reasons, like
speeding or reckless driving, are found to
have been texting, they will face additional
charges and fines. The accompanying Sen-
ate Bill that outlines enforcement, Bill 468,
prescribes a $200 fine for first-time offend-
ers. Subsequent offenders are subject to a
$500 fine.
Most people know the dangers of driv-
ing drunk. But not as many are concerned
about the dangers of texting enough to
leave their cell phones in their pockets or
purses. But a 2009 study by the VTTI con-
cluded that drivers are 23 times more likely
to crash while texting than while focus-
ing on the road. And a 2008 study by the
Transport Research Laboratory showed
that texting while driving decreases reac-
tion time more than the effects of alcohol.
Drunk drivers are subject to huge fines,
license suspensions and jail time. And
though texting while driving is compara-.
bly dangerous, little has been done to stop
it in Michigan - until now.
The current form of the bill is a relief.

During the time that the bill was tabled in
2009, there was discussion of making vio-
lation of the ban a primary offense, which
could have given officers tremendous
latitude to pull drivers over for anything
resembling texting. Making the violation a
secondary offense avoids this concern.
But the legislation alone isn't the most
effective solution to the dangers of tex-
ting while driving. The state must fund a
campaign highlighting the risks associ-
ated with driving while distracted. And
since teens - who already have a high risk
of accident - commonly text more than
adults, they are more likely to be texting
while driving. Incorporating lessons on
the dangers of texting while driving into
driver's education programs could help
stop the problem before it starts.
Next, the state should launch a media
campaign that will make drivers aware of
the consequences of getting caught tex-
ting while driving. The state's successful
"Click It or Ticket" program should be the
model for a similar campaign to stop tex-
ting while driving. Efforts to avoid a fine,
even more than knowledge of the danger,
will prevent drivers from texting.
Texting misspelled messages to friends
isn't worth causing a car accident. The state
has done its part to outlaw this dangerous
behavior. Now it must spread the word.

Dear Little Guy,
Once again, we, the little
guys, have been told that our
power to affect
change is only as
large as our wallets.
After we over-
whelmingly elect-
ed a candidate on a x
platform of change
and watched his
efforts at reform be
strangled by corpo-
rate lobbyists and ALEX
right-wing ideo-
logues, exercising SCHIFF
our right to have
our voices heard
has become more
difficult still.
After we watched Wall Street
reward itself with billions of dollars in
bonuses as a prize for plundering the
livelihoods of average Americans and
sending our economy into its deep-
est downturn of our generation, the
good of the people has yet again taken
a backseat to the good of Big Business,
Big Labor and anythingelse bigenough
to outshout and outspend the little guy.
After nearly three decades of ris-
ing inequality and marginalization of
anyone not lucky enough to be among
the richest one percent, the voice of the
little guy will be diluted even further
thanks to the will of five individuals.
On Thursday, the U.S. Supreme
Court struck down decades of judicial
precedent when it ruled on Citizens
United v. Federal Election Commis-
sion. In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme
Court held that corporations have an
essentiallylimitless right to run adver-
tisements for political campaigns.
The majority found justification for
its decision in the First Amendment,
claiming that a corporation has the
same right as any of us to freedom of
speech and expression.
I would love for someone out there

to tell us how - after this deplorable
decision - they can denounce with
a straight face "liberal" judges for
their "judicial activism," "legislat-
ing from the bench" and all the other
cute little phrases conservatives have
invented for not getting their way. The
Supreme Court has made a 180-degree
turnaround and decided that a wealth
of rulings dating back before any of
us were born were errors. This radi-
cal departure from past rulings on
campaign finance - some as recent as
2003- is the epitome ofjudicial activ-
ism and was driven by the conserva-
tive wing of the Court. As Justice John
Paul Stevens stated in his spirited dis-
sent, "The only relevant thing that has
changed ... is the composition of this
court."
The threat of corporate power to
the integrity of a democracy has been a
concern since this nation's founding. In
1816, Thomas Jefferson wrote, "I hope
we shall crush in its birth the aristoc-
racy of our moneyed corporations,
which dare already to challenge our
government to a trial of strength and
bid defiance to the laws of our coun-
try."While the structure, activities and
nature of businesses have obviously
evolved since that time, the message
behind Jefferson's statement remains
unchanged and eternally relevant.
Corporations (and large powerful
groups in general), if allowed, have
the ability to wield an unequal amount
of influence in the political process.
Politicians hear those voices far more
directly than our own viathe process of
lobbying. This is the process by which
corporations and other large special
interest groups send representatives to
pressure members of Congress to enact
policies that further their goals and/or
boost their profits.
But there is no lobbyist for "We
the People."
Consider the factthat, accordingto a
December poll by the National Wildlife.

Federation, 82 percent of voters wants
more government investment in clean
energysources and 67percentsupports
the government limiting carbon emis-
sions. That's an enormous majority of
us that favors these policies, yet our
will has not become law. The cap-and-
trade legislation passed by the House
of Representatives to address this issue
- which it has already watered down
to a barely tolerable level of efficacy -
has sat dead in the Senate.
The People should *
have the loudest
voice in politics.
The reason is simple: money.
According to the Center for Respon-
sive Politics, in 2009, the oil and gas
industry spent $120,729,855 in lobby-
ing to make sure its voice drowned out
ours. And politicians know how valu-
able this sector can be in a campaign
- in 2008 the oil and gas industry
made campaign contributions totaling
$35,589,287. No wonder Republicans
are fighting so hard against a cause so
many of us favor - 77 percent of that
money went to their party's candidates.
And this was all before the Supreme
Court gave corporations an even larg-
er and more entrenched role in the
political process. The disappointing
reality is that all voices are not equal
when money plays such a large role in
our politics. But even if you find my
outrage too strong or my rhetoric too
harsh, I have a voice, and despite this
gross blow to democracy, Iwill make it
heard. Will you?

Green Crusade falls short

Intolerantpolitics

Part bromide, part battle cry, the phrase
"Go green" inspires something akin to moral
superiority combined with tech savvy. Any-
one that has visited a college campus in the
last five years has seen the extent to which
"being green" has dominated everything from
research to the mottos of the maintenance
crews. Being green is supposedly the answer to
everything from economic recession to climate
change, but what has the Green Crusade done
to deserve this pedestal?
With people like Paul Ehrlich claiming that
"England [would] not exist by the year 2000"
back in 1969, it's almost too easy to cherry pick
absurd quotes from the leaders of the Green
Crusade. But what the Green Crusade has actu-
ally done since it became a dominant force in
American and global culture is more telling
than a few poorly thought-out one liners.
Consider, for instance, the billions of dollars
of taxpayer money poured into research and
development of hydrogen-based alternative
fuel technologies, largely at the behest of the
Green Crusade. Last year, Secretary of Ener-
gy Stephen Chu announced that he felt that a
hydrogen-based car economy wouldn't be fea-
sible in the coming decades and promptly took
an axe to the hydrogen car initiative, reducing
fiunds by $100 million. Instead, the current
administration has elected to pursue electrical
and hybrid "solutions." But the real punch line
is that, in the meantime, the Green Crusade has
been vigorously advocating another of its main
agendas, a "Cap and Trade" scheme, which
means that, in the words of President Barack
Obama, "Electricity rates would necessarily
skyrocket." The Green Crusade is not offer-
ing a better source of energy at all, merely less
energy all around.
And how about the story of BrightSource
Energy's Mojave power plant? BrightSource is
a developer of solar-based energy that recently
proposed the construction of a 5,130-acre solar
farm capable of generating over 500 megawatts

of electricity in a remote region of the eastern
Mojave Desert. As a leader in renewable ener-
gy, BrightSource has taglines and business
themes with a clearly "green" bend to them,
so it should have gone forth with the blessing
of the Green Crusade, right? Wrong. Between
opposition from the Wildlands Conservancy
and a push for legislation to turn the area into a
national hsonument, BrightSource had to scrap
plans for the solar plant. The policies of the
various factions of the Green Crusade again
came into conflict, resulting in lost time and
destroyed wealth.
Some might say that these issues arise due to
a few irrational elements present in the move-
ment. This perspective fails to recognize that
such conflicts arise when energy policy is made
by pitting the earth against humanity. When a
criterion for evaluation of energy policy is "mini-
mizing impact" on the earth, the logical result
will be outcomes that eliminate energy produc-
tion and use. The Green Crusade has provided
a plethora of examples showing how its driving
philosophy ultimately leads not to alternative,
abundant, clean energy but just to a reduction in
energy consumption altogether. Energy is vital
to the wondrous technologies that contribute
to America's standard of living. From BMWs to
gene sequencers to iPhones to particle accelera-
tors, all are dependent on abundant, cheap ener-
gy. It's time for Americans to re-evaluate their
decision to allow the Green Crusaders to become
spokesmen for the future of energy, technology
and even morality in our country.
The Students of Objectivism will be hosting
a guest speaker to further discuss this issue.
Keith Lockitch, a fellow from the Ayn Rand
Center for Individual Rights, will speak on
Wednesday, Feb. 3 at 7:30 p.m. in Angell Hall
Auditorium C. The event is open to the public.
We welcome those interested in hearing a dif-
ferent perspective on the Green Crusade.

t seems I may owe my readers an
apology. Having reread the col-
umn I wrote two weeks ago about
the Michigan gov-
erhor's race (The
amazing, underrat- 3
ed race, 01/19/10),
it's apparent that
I sounded like a
Republican cheer- '
leader. So this
week, I'm set- '
ting out to redeem
myself to my liberal ROBERT
friends. SOAVE
Enter state Rep.
Paul Scott (R-
Grand Blanc).
Scott, a 27-year-old who earned
his undergraduate and law degrees
from the University, was first elected
to the state House of Representatives
in 2008. In the same election that
brought the United States its first black
president, President Barack Obama,
Scott became one of only two African
Americans elected to the state House
since 1904. In his first year in office
he's done nothing but annoy me, espe-
cially with his unwavering support
for the statewide ban on smoking in
privately owned establishments. But I
know, my liberal friends, that this may
actually endear him to many of you.
Patience - you will share my loathing
of Scott, I promise.
According to an article in the Flint
Journal last month, Scott has made
plans to run for Secretary of State. In
a letter announcing his candidacy, he
spelled out his top four priorities if
elected to the position. Let me draw
your attention to number three on
his list: "I will make it a priority to
ensure transgender individuals will
not be allowed to change the sex on
their driver's license in any circum-
stance."
Yes, you read that correctly.
I know what you're thinking:
finally, a candidate with the courage
to scale back rights for the transgen-

dered. And these people thought they
could have difficult; expensive, life-
altering surgeries to help them feel
comfortable with themselves - and
that the rest of us would just put up
with it! Thank goodness we've got
Scott looking out for us. "That's who
you are. You can have cosmetic sur-
gery or reassignment surgery but
you are still that gender," he told
the Michigan Messenger last month.
There's no fooling this guy.
But not only is Scott passionate
about shunning an already marginal-
ized community - doing so is in fact
his third most important governmen-
tal priority. If you were unable to sleep
at night out of fear that the next Sec-
retary of State might waste time sim-
plifying Michigan's voter registration
or driver's licensing systems instead of
chasing transgender people back into
the shadows from whence they came,
Scott should put you at ease. Forming
a better relationship with the Attorney
General's office? Nope. Consolidat-
ing branch offices? Further down the
list. Reducing expenditures in order
to lessen the tax burden? Please. Tax-
payers are obviously more interested
in fighting for the obscure causes of a
fringe social conservative agenda than
saving money.
Speaking of the fringe social con-
servative agenda, the Grand Rapids
Press reported last month that the
Michigan chapter of the Ameri-
can Family Association is the group
demanding that someone take up this
fight. In the article, Michigan AFA
President Gary Glenn cited trans-
gender people using restrooms other
than those intended for their original
biological sex as one of the reasons
for revising the current policy, which
allows the transgendered to change
the sex on their licenses.
But even if your top concern really
is this whole restroom thing (and if it
is, you are an absurd person), driver's
licenses don't really affect the situa-
tion. I don't remember ever having to

show my license to use the restroom.
Will Secretary of State officials now
stand guard at every toilet in the state?
Will they conduct full-body searches
to discover your true gender? Does the
AFA support such action?
Gender identity
shouldn't be
state-regulated.
All jokes asideit's reallya shame to
see such a chronically misunderstood
and disrespected minority treated so
terribly. Choosing to undergo gender
reassignment surgery or seek ther-
apy for gender-related issues takes a
great deal of courage. The least the
state can do is support such courage
by granting transgender people some
dignity and letting them change the
sex on their licenses.
Which brings me back to candidate
Scott. I expect such lunacy from the
AFA (this organization recently boy-
cotted Gap and Old Navy for not being
"pro-Christmas" enough), not from
Republican legislators. And what's
more, I expect much better from grad-
uates of the University. How someone
could spend years in Ann Arbor and
not gain a single ounce of compassion
for socially marginalized people is
beyond me.
But even social conservatives
should recognize that a guy who lists
this issue in his top four priorities is
the wrong candidate for Secretary
of State. Republican primary voters,
show us that you won't fall for such
pointless demagoguery and pick some-
body else.

The Bad Plus has been praised by critics for its inventive and creative style.
Jazzy masterpie

'U' professors analyze the
evolution of jazz by way of
up-and-coming jazz
trio The Bad Plus
By HEATHER POOLE
For the Daily
What does it take for a song or perfor-
mance to earn the
prestigious title of "mas- Masterpieces
terpiece?" A program Revealed:
from the University
Musical Society, "Mas- The Bad Plus
terpieces Revealed," is
dedicated to uncovering Tonight at 7 p.m.
the elements requisite to UMMA Commons
such acclaim. Tonight, Free
one such element will be
explored in particular: inventiveness.
Professor of Jazz and Contemporary
Improvisation Andrew Bishop, along with
Professor of Music Theory Andrew Mead,
will lead tonight's session devoted to the
music of up-and-coming jazz trio The Bad
Plus, comprised of bassist Reid Anderson,
pianist Ethan Iverson and drummer David
King. Since the group's debut in 2000, its
inventive and creative performances and
adaptations have gained national recogni-
tion from music publications like Rolling
Stone and The New York Times.
The series is designed to examine the
work of artists included on the UMS bill
of performances, and this lecture accom-
panies The Bad Plus's concert at the Lydia
Mendelssohn Theatre on Thursday, Feb. 4.
The University of Michigan Museum of

Art plays host to tonight's presentation,
and its website describes the lecture series
as follows.
"In the 'Masterpieces Revealed' series,
local artists provide a step-by-step explora-
tion of some of the artistic works presented
on the UMS season through live perfor-
mance and discussion, deconstructing the
nuances of performance and explaining
what turns a piece into a 'masterpiece.'"
Even though it's often classified as a
"traditional" jazz group, The Bad Plus
transcends this label, moving into the ter-
ritory of the musically masterful.
"The Bad Plus uses a traditional jazz
piano trio (piano, bass and drums) but per-
forms music from a wide variety of artists,
not just jazz composers," Bishop wrote in an
e-mail interview with The Michigan Daily.
Bishop's program will incorporate a live
performance by The Bad Plus and a discus-
sion with Mead and University students.
"I will be breaking down why artists
stray from the standard repertoire, such
as composers like Duke Ellington," Bishop
wrote. "I will mostly be talking about why
jazz musicians are interested in exploring
musical landscapes outside the traditional
jazz format."
In addition to his extensive knowledge
of jazz, Bishop has personal relations to
The Bad Plus from past collaborations
with Anderson that should give his com-
ments some particular insight into the
trio's musical inspiration.
"Reid is an amazing musician. We did
one recording together - Gerald Cleaver's
'Adjust.' He is an extremely versatile musi-
cian," Bishop wrote.
Like Bishop, Mead is interested in how
The Bad Plus breaks through traditions in

music. In demonstrating the originality of
its music, Mead and Bishop will focus on
The Bad Plus's rendition of Milton Bab-
bitt's "Semi-Simple Variations."
"Babbitt is known - is even notorious -
for writing music that is highly structured
and not immediately appealing - at least
to the average concert-goer," Mead wrote.
"So for a jazz group to be playing his music
would seem really contra-intuitive."
Mead attributes the success of The Bad
Plus to its distinctive approach to jazz in
comparison to historical traditions. This
atypical musical style can be seen in the
group's adaptation of "Semi-Simple Varia-
tions."
"Obviously, things like free jazz and
other developments over the past 50 or
60 years have enlarged and enriched the
range of possibilities in jazz, buta continu-
ous thread throughout has been the idea of
improvisation," Mead wrote.
"(The Bad Plus), in playing Babbitt's
piece, is playing an interesting game with
this tradition, in that they are presenting,
for the most part, a straight-ahead reading
of a fully notated piece for solo piano," he
wrote.
Mead also commended the way The Bad
Plus successfully adapts "Semi-Simple
Variations" to its own style.
And really, that's what this presentation
is all about: how jazz is being interpreted
by modern music makers. It will explore
how the jazz musicians of today are mak-
ing new masterpieces based on how the
cool cats used to jive. The program, while
music oriented, is not particularly techni-
cal, Bishop said, and should allow students
from all different backgrounds to learn
from it.

Trending
Has anyone other than my fellow
TV lovers at the Daily real-
ized how many ghost-hunting
shows are on TV
these days? "Ghost
Lab," "The Haunted,"
"Paranormal Cops,"
"Ghost Hunters" and
its spin-offs "Ghost t
Hunters Interna-4
tional" and "Ghoste
Hunters Academy"
all came out fairly CAROLYN
recently (with the KLARECKI
exception of the orig-
inal "Ghost Hunters,"
which aired in 2004).
And because networks keep spewing
out this repetitive programming, I guess
someone must be watching and enjoying
it. But let's be honest, "Ghost Hunters"
isn't a brilliant and incredibly well exe-
cuted concept. And even if it were, does
anyone appreciate the products of dirty
idea-stealing and show-copying?
Hopping on the good-idea bandwag-
on isn't anew thing for TV. It's really to
be expected these days. Before ghosts,
we had dancing. "Dancing with the
Stars" came out the same year as "So
You Think You Can Dance" and not too
much later the world was blessed with
a lesser-known gem "Pants-Off Dance-
Off." Based on titles alone, I think we
all know which one isn't around today.
Sometimes the drama surrounding
having a stake in the next big thing
is more exciting than the shows that
come of it. Remember NBC's "The
Singing Bee" and FOX's "Don't Forget
the Lyrics!"? The concept was exactly
the same, they premiered within one
day of each other and they were both
hosted by charming B-list celebrities
(comedian Wayne Brady for FOX and
former 'N Sync member Joey Fatone
for NBC). Neither show was spectacu-
lar, but the race to air first was epic.
And when we've passed the point
of network competition, we get rein-
carnates. "If you loved this show, just
wait for our 40 dozen spin-offs!" the
networks scream. We're practically
assaulted with competitive reality
shows that can be described by inter-
changing the words "hair stylist,"
"fashion designer" and "chef." Not
only do we have "CSI," "Law & Order"
and "NCIS," but we also get "CSI: NY,"
"CSI: Miami," "Law & Order: Special
Victims Unit," "Law & Order: Criminal
Intent," "Law & Order: Crime & Pun-
ishment," "Law & Order: Trial by Jury"
and "NCIS: Los Angeles."
It's frustrating. When I turn on the
TV, I don't want to be bombarded with
the same show reinvented and repack-
aged as though the network executives
think I won't noticed I'm being fed
leftovers.
But before we give up on TV, let's take
a look at the larger picture. Trending
is common in all forms of art. Novels
have undergone romanticism, realism
and transcendentalism. We have cub-

TV topics
ism, impressionism and pop art in the
realm of visual arts. And music has
been revolutionized by rock, soul, hip
hop, grunge, indie, techno and scores of
other genres all in the past 50 years.
But no one ever complained that Tho-
reau totally copied Emerson and no one
ever got sick of Picasso's repetitive style.
And even though lo-fi indie bands with
buttery smooth melodies and haunt-
ingly poetic lyrics outnumber water
molecules on Earth, tons of people still
listen to and love the sound-alikes.
These trends are considered "move-
ments," but television doesn't get the
luxury of a pretty title. In the fine arts,
the creators are allowed to expand upon
ideas and concepts from each other
without criticism, but on TV it's brand-
ed as repetitive, annoying and even
insulting. No one is going to call the
onslaught of ghost television a "move-
ment," because quite frankly, that's
ridiculous (what movement would that
even be? Paranormalism?). TV can be an
art, and in my mind has every right to
undergo movements. But there are good
reasons why TV is especially prone to
It's all about the
Benjamins, but it
shouldn't be.
the type of criticism I'm talking about.
TV is inherently commercial. While
writers, musicians and other artists
create primarily for themselves and
personal expression, TV is created as
a commodity. When was the last time
you heard the creator of a TV show say
"I make the shows for myself?"
Some TV creators honestly do love
their stories and jobs, but there is
little room for creative expression and
experimentation in the TV industry,
which relies on ratings much more
than music and film, both of which
have strong indie markets. Artists
should support each other's work, but
network competition and ratings create
bloody battles to the death - we all saw
what happened to Conan.
What the industry needs is a little
more love and tenderness. Shows need
to be created for the sake of creation,
expression and joy. TV needs people
who are passionate about telling sto-
ries, capturing them ina compelling
way and sharingthem with the masses
every week. And while a strong love of
the small screen probably isn't enough
to disrupt 50 years of trying to make
big money off cheap programming, it's
a step in the right direction. If more
people treat TV as an art, a movement
will swiftly follow.

By LINDSAY HURD
For the Daily
It's not every day a show opens with the
line "Normal cops by day, paranormal cops
by night. We don't rest
until your case is closed."
"Paranormal Cops"
shows us why.
The producers of this Paranormal
new A&E program want- COPS
ed to put a new twist on
the typical show about the Tuesdays
paranormal (a broad topic at 10:30
covering everything from A&E
psychic kids to haunted
houses), so they opted to
put two common TV ideas together: cops
and ghosts. While the notion is unique,
there's a reason this show hasn't been done
before - it just doesn't make sense.
This new reality series follows Sergeant
Ron Fabiani and other off-duty cops as they
drive around in a van and "help" people
who have unruly ghosts living where they
work. Their first client is Roger, a nighttime
security guard at Big Timers Sound Shop,
who feels a "presence" when he's working
his shift. This presence has apparently got-
ten so bad that he wants to quit his job, but
can't because of his wife and kids. So what
does he do? He calls in the Paranormal
Cops, of course.
For lovers of cop shows, "Paranormal
Cops"=apes programs like "Cold Case" that
investigate crime scenes and work to put
offenders in jail. But in "Paranormal," the
criminal is a ghost and the team never does
anything to get rid of it. Nothing is solved
and criminals are not locked up.
Unfortunately for paranormal aficiona-
dos, the actual "ghost" encounters are obvi-
ously faked by a team of producers. Videos
of dust or bugs flying around at night are
presented as spirits and any hint of activity
in the warehouse is so'exaggerated that it's
cheesy and hard to watch. The team looks
plain crazy as they discuss how to figure out
if a ghost is present and where it came from.

Beret? Check. Cigar? Check. Ghosts? ... Shit.
Needless to say, Roger is probably the sanest
character on the show.
The tackiest part of "Paranormal Cops" is
when the task force investigates the shop ina
nighttime walk-through with the assistance
of a medium who uses ridiculous phrases
like "I feel a weird presence in this room" or
"There is something that I'm not fond of" to
convince the viewers of a spirit's existence.
The crew uses questionably legitimate
high-tech equipment that lights up when-
ever a ghost is near. The combination of
'Go fuck yourselves'
-A made-up ghost.
this "ghost communicator" gadget, which
looks like an old-school snake light, and the
medium's interpretation of ghostly messag-
es results in an overly dramatic, obviously
unreal investigation.
By the end of their stakeout, the Sergeant
and company bump into a spirit who says

the word "Rosario" a few times. The crew's
background research conveniently reveals
that Big Timers was once a mafia casino
run by mobster Rocco Debrazia, who was
murdered on the premises. Rosario was the
name of his best friend who would. often
come into the casino. What a shocker.
The only hint ofanythingentertaining(but
only because it's the most idiotic thing ever)
is the moment when Sgt. Fabiani and Roger
review sounds collected from the former
crime scene. Instead of whispers of murder
or how the ghost died, Rocco's ghost instead
tells the cops to "Go fuck (themselves)"
During the wrap-up meeting, Fabini and
his team conclude that ... wait for it ... ghosts
exists in Roger's workplace. Yes, let's do
an entire show about how there is a ghost
inhabiting this building only to conclude
there is an actual ghost. Apparently, the
producers of this show are geniuses too. Is
"Paranormal Cops" actively trying to make
itself look idiotic and pre-scripted?
If this is what Fabiani and his gang do
with their spare time to contribute to""pub-
lic safety," someone should tell them to geta
real hobby.

By SHARON JACOBS
AssistantArts Editor
The sea, according to English song-
stress Corinne Bailey Rae, is a brooding
and melancholy place.
Rae's solitary journey *
into the open ocean on
her new release The Sea Hin1
comes two years after
her husband's fatal Bailey Rae
methadone and alcohol The Sea
overdose. This back-
story is essential to the Capitol
album, which repre-
sents a departure from the cheery inno-
cence of Rae's self-titled debut.
"He's a real live wire," Rae says of her
late husband in the first line of The Sea.
The opening is a little creepy and dark,
but Rae's intimate voice immediately
wraps the listener in. Murmured memo-
ries of her husband's eyes and the taste
of summer build toward the plaintive cry
of the track's titular line "Are you here"
- there's no question mark. We already
know the answer.
As is typical of Corinne Bailey Rae, the
song feels like a glimpse into a very pri-
vate and personal moment. Listening to
"Are You Here," the subsequent rumina-
tion "I'd Do It All Again" and many of the
other songs on The Sea is like overhearing
Rae's real-time attempt to come to terms
with her husband's untimely death. But
instead of watching from a distance, we
feel the pain and confusion alongside her.
Rae is neither a Beyonc6-fabulous
R&B diva nor a drama-crazy pop star.
Though most of the songs on The Sea are
poppy in structure, Rae has the delicate
touch of an indie singer-songwriter,
baring her soul in a classy and relat-
able way. Her pitch-perfect voice can
carry itself with minimal instrumen-
tation, as she proves on harmonically

simple tracks like "Love's On Its Way."
Anchored by a light guitar-and-percus-
sion backing, Rae spreads her voice thin
for an angelic effect in the gracefully
ascending chorus, only to slip back into
a thick, mournfully tuneful texture in
the verses.
Though all its tracks are tenderly nos-
talgic, not everything on The Sea is mired
in tragedy. "Paris Nights/New York
Mornings" fondly recalls carefree days in
love. The song is reminiscent of some of
the peppier songs on her first album, but
the images are more mature - "I can see
the lights from the restaurant / I couldn't
quite perfect that nonchalance / Paris
and champagne like warm brown sugar
cubes." Corinne Bailey Rae recalled sum-
mer youth and first love, while The Sea
seems to come several lifetimes later. It's
like the calm after the storm of grown-up
calamity.
Often dark and heavy, The Sea might
throw off fans looking for lighthearted
fun. The deep, low opening and urgently
fluttering piano chords of "Feels Like The
First Time" reveal a restless poignancy,
and the song ends without any melodic or
lyrical closure. "Paper Dolls" has a simi-
larly pressing, urgent feel. Heavy key-
board harmonies and a solid drumbeat
underscore a story of a girl realizing her
own potential too late to change.
There's no "Put Your Records On"
here - Rae's 2006 radio hit about self-
love, "sapphire and faded dreams." But
The Sea is a satisfying release from - and
for - an artist sure to stay on the musical
radar for a long time. It's a sad story, but
one that makes for stirring art. And by
the end of the delicately building album
closer, it's clear that Corinne Bailey Rae
has come to peace with "the majestic sea
(that) breaks everything, crushes every-
thing, cleans everything, takes every-
thing from me."

expected Slottow to sign the letter
needed to move forward by the end
of the week.
According to state statute, the
committee is supposed to be com-
prised of two students, two mem-
bers of the faculty and two staff
members - each elected by their
respective groups biannually.
However elections of commit-
tee members have not followed
the statute's requirements. In fact,
faculty elections haven't occurred
since 2000.
And while staff have held elec-
tions, non-union and union staff
voted separately - meaning each
staff only has a say in one of the two
staff seats.
At the same time, MSA had been
appointingstudentstoholdtheposi-
tions, instead of allowing students
to elect them directly. According to
lawyers interviewed by The Michi-
gan Daily last fall, MSA's appoint-
ment procedure did not fall in line
with the statute that created the
oversight committee. In December,
MSA decided to put two candidates
for the committee on the ballot for
the elections in the spring.

instead only saying that she was
grateful for her position at the Uni-
versity.
"You know, newspaper people

nant, and Gonzales said he worried
that if she had not been as far along
in her pregnancy, then the accident
could have killed the baby.
"Little Abigail had no problems
when she was born, but had my
daughter-in-law been two-months
pregnant, maybe the force from
the crash could have been fatal
to Abigail when she was a fetus,"
Gonzales said. "That's what really
inspired me to do this."
Gonzales said he hopes the law
will eventually become a primary
offense, but he's satisfied with the
legislation's current progress and
sees it as a starting point for future
changes.
"At least we can ban texting," he
said. "It will be a secondary offense,
but at least we can get something
out of it and we can make it better
over time."
State Rep. Pam Byrnes (D-Lyn-
don Twp.) said that if the bill is
passed, in the future, texting will
likely become a primary offense,
which is similar to the progression

at the airport in one hour.
Once he was on the plane head-
ing towards Haiti, Soong and his
crew members were told that if
they did not land by 1:30 p.m., the
military air traffic controls would
direct them back to Miami.
"We circled many times over
Port-au-Prince. It was 1:29 and our
hope was starting to fade, and then
we felt the landing gear go down
and the airplane slowed down.
And we were going in, we made it
in," Soong said, explaining that the
abundance of planes trying to land
caused delays on the runway.
, While the plane ride was a jour-
ney in itself, Soong said it was on
the ground in Port-au-Prince where
the real experience began.
The University of Miami four-
tent field hospital that Soong
worked at in Port-au-Prince was
located next to the Port-au-Prince
airport - where there was always
air traffic coming in and out of the

U.N.,: Goals for

are insufficient

University President Mary Sue Coleman speaks to SACUA yesterday about possible state cuts to University funding.

the State address in Lansing tomor-
row night.
Coleman said that she wasn't
entirely sure what would be pro-
posed during the address, but she
would be listening very closely for
any changes or updates regarding
the state budget and its appropria-
tions for higher education.
Coleman said she would be very
vocal in response to any cost cut-
ting for the University's budget.
Later in the meeting Prof. Wayne
Stark, who teaches Electrical Engi-
neering and Computer Science and
in October, Coleman did tell the
paper that the next NCAA president
should be a university president
from a school with a Division 1 ath-
letic program.
"I am deeply engaged at the Uni-
versity of Michigan," Coleman told
the Times in October.
Last month, The Associated Press
reported that the NCAA search
committee intends to have a suc-
cessor named by this summer and
in place before the start of the next
academic year.
Those currently being reported
of Michigan's legislation regarding
seatbelt use.
"I think that it probably should
be a primary, but I don't think you
could get the majority of the peo-
ple to make it a primary offense,"
Byrnes said. "It's about giving peo-
ple a period of time to adjust to it, so
I would expectthat in years to come
it will become a primary offense."
Byrnes also said texting while
driving is an issue many legislators
are concerned about and willing to
support as it makes the eventual
move to federal legislation.
"We also know thatthere's going
to be federal regulations at some
point in time that will require that
we do this to receive our federal
transportation dollars," Byrnes
added. "So we're just trying to be
proactive and make sure we have
legislation that enforces the tex-
ting while driving."
State Sen. Liz Brater (D-Ann
Arbor) said she's supportive of the
bill, adding that legislation of this
nature is often hard to pass.
"It's better than the current sit-
uation," she said. "At least it sends
a message that this is an illegal
activity that cannot be tolerated."
airport, even throughout the night,
Soong said.
The procedures that were con-
ducted at the field hospital were
mainly orthopedic. And while
Soong specializes in ophthalmolo-
gy, he helped with surgeries, ampu-
tations and whatever else he could.
"I did radiology, putting casts
on, reducing fractures, amputa-
tions, taking bed pans out, sweep-
ing the floor," Soong said. "There is
absolutely no space for egos or not
wanting to do anything. It was just
so crazy you had to help out."
Soong said shortages in medical
equipment led volunteers to impro-
vise. A flashlight was used as light
during operations and a hypoder-
mic needle was wrapped around a
broken pair of microscopic goggles
to hold them together.
Even toothpaste served another
purpose for the people in Port-au-
Prince.
"Interestingly, when I was down
there I saw people with white

toothpaste on their upper lip,"
Soongsaid. "Toothpaste was a very
popular commodity because the

is a member of SACUA, questioned
Coleman regarding a dispropor-
tionate increase in tuition rates
relative to inflation.
Stark asked Coleman if a decel-
eration of tuition increases could be
possible, fearing that some middle-
class families would become unable
to afford tuition in the future while
not qualifying for financial aid.
Coleman defended the Univer-
sity's tuition increases, saying she
believed they were less than the
higher education inflation rate - a
measure of cost increases for col-
as candidates for the post include
University of Georgia President
Michael Adams, who hasn't yet
definitively denied his interest.
"We're Georgians. We love it
here," Adams told the AP of his fam-
ily. "My family is happy here, and if
the regents will let me stay, I expect
to be here. Is that clear enough?"
Penn State University President
Graham Spanier is also rumored to
be on the short list of candidates,
though he has denied he is being
considered.
Uiversity of Miami President
State Sen. John Gleason
(D-Flushing), member of the Sen-
ate Committee on Transportation,
said he is worried that making the
law a primary offense would cause
drivers to earn high numbers of
bad driver points, which would
lead to high fees and fines.
"I really have mixed emotions
on it," he said. "We have a bad driv-
ers fee where if you collect so many
points you get a $1,000 fine. So
this is a rather new law and I'd be
concerned about more people that
would qualify for the bad driver's
fee."
Despite the penalties for drivers,
he said he views the law as impor-
tant to teaching about the value of
driving safety.
"We have really a tremendous
learning opportunity," Gleason
said. "I don't want people to start
getting tickets on the new law. I'd
like to see it kind of get eased into
place, but thatcan be accomplished
just by advising and warning peo-
ple about the offense."
Kinesiology junior Lara Hitch-
cock echoed Gleason's sentiments,
adding that the legislation would
be important for educating driv-
mint in it took care of the stench of
the corpses. It was everywhere."
Soong said crime also hindered
doctors' ability to provide neces-
sary help.
"Things were really scant and
people were coming in and steal-
ing medical supplies, and the local
prison had broken down so all of
the violent characters escaped," he
said. "They were out in the street,
and there were a lot of gangs."
The situation was so bad that
Soong said the scene at the field
hospital was like a war zone. He
added that doctors employed a tri-
age system, often being forced to
treat those with "medium inju-
ries" before those with less severe
injuries because they had a better
chance of saving them than those
with more serious injuries.
"That's the triage system," Soong
said. "Just like in civil war. And it
was very much like civil war."
Though it was difficult to deal
with most of what he saw in Haiti,
Soong said some stories from the

trip did have happy endings. When
a baby was born at the field hospi-

leges and universities.
She explained that students are
getting an excellent education and
college experience for the tuition
cost, adding that she is working
very hard to continue cost cutting
while maintaining quality.
Coleman said while she could
decrease tuition rates "tomorrow,"
it would require her to cut pro-
grams for students, increase class
sizes or decrease faculty salaries.
-Sabira Khan contributed
to this report.
Donna Shalala, who served as the
U.S. Secretary of Health and Human
Services for eight years under Presi-
dent Clinton, has also been reported
as a possible candidate.
"I am not a candidate and really
have no interest," Shalala told the
AP in an e-mail. "I amsure there are
good candidates."
University of Hartford President
Walt Harrison may be one of those
candidates. He is one of the only
names being rumored as a candi-
date who has reportedly expressed
interest in the position.
ers.
"I think I'd be in support of it
because I've tried texting while
driving and it's pretty difficult,"
Hitchcock said. "And there's times
when I'm texting and I obviously
should be paying more attention to
the road rather than texting."
In regards to it being a second-
ary offense, Hitchcock said that
texting could likely be the cause
of the primary offense in the first
place.
"If you're getting pulled over for
a traffic offense in the first place,
then obviously texting is affecting
your driving," Hitchcock said.
Business sophomore Solomon
Ravich said he thinks cell phone
regulation is important to prevent-
ing accidents and increasing driver
safety. Ravich added that in his
home state of New York, the use
of cell phones while driving is pro-
hibited without a headset device.
"Texting while driving is way
worse than anything you can
do," said Ravich. "It takes your
attention completely away from
driving...I'm in support of (the leg-
islation) because it would reduce
accidents and help safety."
tal, Soongsaid all the surgeons took
a short break from their surgeries
and applauded the happy moment.
"The other surgeons at the
other areas stopped their surger-
ies for about two minutes and they
clapped," Soong said. "Everybody
was just yelling and then back to
the heavy stuff again, so, ups and
downs. Within a minute or two,
you have ups and downs of emo-
tion."
The field hospital was in an area
that consisted of many other field
hospitals, from countries all around
theworld--includingChina,Korea,
Portugal, Peru, Czech Republic,
Qatar and Israel.
"There's a lot of hugging", Soong
said. "They will come up to us
medical guys saying 'bless you' and
we'll hug them, like a hug-fest. It
was like you could see how good
humanity can be when there is a
need."
Soong arrived back in Ann Arbor
last week, but he said his experi-
ences in Haiti still remain fresh

in his mind, and that he hopes to
return to Haiti as early as March.

Official says goals
won't do enough to
fight global warming
UNITEDNATIONS (AP) -The
greenhouse gas goals announced
by the nations responsible for
most emissions are insufficient
against the disastrous effects of
climate change, a U.N. official
said yesterday.
Janos Pasztor, Secretary-Gener-
al BanKi-moon's top climate advis-
er, said the goals, submitted to the
U.N. as part of a voluntary plan to
roll back emissions, make it highly
unlikely the world can prevent
temperatures from rising above
the target set at the Copenhagen
climate conference in December.
"It is likely, accordingto a num-
ber of analysts, that if we add up
all those figures that were being
discussed around Copenhagen,
if they're all implemented, it will
still be quite difficult to reach the
two degrees," Pasztor told the
Associated Press.
The "two degrees" refers to the
Copenhagen target of keeping the
Earth's average temperature from
rising two degrees Celsius (3.6
degrees Fahrenheit) above prein-
dustrial levels.
"That is the bottom line, but

you can look at it negatively and
positively. The negative part is
that it's not good enough," he
said. "The positive side is that for
the first time, we have agoal, a
clear goal that we're all working
toward, and we know what the
commitments are. ... Before we
would just talk."
Pasztor said some 50 nations -
includingChina, the United States
and 27-member European Union
- sent intheir commitment letters
by the Feb. 1 deadline set at the
Copenhagen climate conference in
December. More such letters were
expected to continue trickling in
over the next several days.
The commitmentletters,which
largely reaffirm previous pledges,
were intended to get an idea of
how far the nations most respon-
sible for global warming might
be willing to go, toward a legally
binding pact.
China has pledged to reduce
its emissions growth - not make
absolute cuts - by up to 45 percent
from 2005 levels by 2020. India
also pledged to reduce emissions
growth by up to 25 percent from
2005 levels by 2020.
The United States stuck to
President Barack Obama's pledge
to cut its absolute carbon emis-
sions by about 17 percent by 2020
below 2005 levels.

Debate over int'l.
adoption grows
in wake of quake

Groups urge
moratorium on
adoption from Haiti
after 10 are arrested
NEW YORK (AP) - The
debate over international adop-
tion, already a bitter one, has
intensified in the aftermath
of Haiti's earthquake and the
arrest of 10 Americans for try-
ing to take children out of the
devastated country without per-
mission.
Some groups are urging a
long moratorium on new adop-
tions from Haiti, saying there
is too much chaos and too high
a risk of mistakes or child traf-
ficking. Other groups fear any
long-term clampdown will con-
sign countless children to lives
in institutions or on the street,
rather than in the loving homes

them that he was "expecting
strippers for a show."
The officer and the advisorlater
entered the floor study lounge,
where they found the group sit-
ting around in a circle, according
to Logan. But "there were no out-
siders that they could determine
present," Logan said.
Logan said the officer warned
the group that strippers were not
permitted in the lounge, as that
would be a "violation of Commu-
nity Living Standards."
Logan said Housing's Commu-
nity Living Standards state that
"behavior that is disruptive to
orderly community living is pro-
hibited" in the residence halls.
This behavior "includes but is
not limited to streaking, nudity
and sexual activity in common
areas," Logan said.
Therefore, Logan said if a "strip
tease in the community lounge"
had occurred, that would have
constituted a violation.
Though Logan couldn't con-
firm that strippers were in the
residence hall, Bidwell said he
was part of a group that walked
them to a friend's room.
"We met them atthe front door,
walked themin and then everyone
started going crazy," he said.
Bidwell said the group then
moved to the study lounge
because the original room, which
contained 12 to 15 of his friends,
was too small.
Because they were discovered
in the lounge, Bidwell said the
group moved to another room on

of adoptive parents.
Chuck Johnson, chief operat-
ing officer of the National Coun-
cil for Adoption, said the arrests
of the 10 U.S. Baptists would
probably undercut his organiza-
tion's push to expand adoptions
from Haiti as soon as feasible.
"It was a critical mistake -
the Haitian government has
been very clear they did not
want any children leaving with-
out its express permission,"
Johnson said yesterday. "Maybe
the Americans thought they
were helping 33 kids, but now
there's going to be a much slow-
er process and maybe even a ban
on future adoptions - and that
would be a tragedy."
The Americans, arrested Fri-
day near Haiti's border with
the Dominican Republic, were
being held in a police headquar-
ters in Port au Prince while Hai-
tian and U.S officials discussed
their fate.
the floor. They were discovered
again and then were forced to
return to the original room.
Bidwell said he and his friends
do not know what the conse-
quences of their actions will be.
"We don't really know if we're
in trouble for it yet; we don't think
so," he said.
Logan said with the informa-
tion he has heard thus far, there
were no violations of Community
Living Standards. Because there
is no incident report on file, "there
was essentially no incident," he
said.
LSA freshman Chris Miller said
he knew of the incident, because
he heard "a big ruckus" coming
from the floor when he returned
to his neighboring hall late that
night.
Miller also said news of the
incident traveled quickly to oth-
ers in the dorm.
"Word had gotten out, and
everyone was talking about it," he
said.
LSA freshman Michael Harri-
son said he heard students talking
about the incident over lunch, and
while he thinks it is "hilarious,"
he added that he also thinks it's
inappropriate.
"Realistically, should there
be strippers in a dorm hall? No,
that's not courteous to other
members of the opposite sex,"
Harrison said.
Ryan Eskuri, LSA freshman
and Markley resident, also said
the act was not considerate to
others.
"They should be respectful to
everyone living here and not just
be so selfish and want to be plea-
sured by a stripper," Eskuri said.

With Camp Randall
Classic approaching,
Hogan relishes
outdoor practice
By MARK BURNS
Daily Sports Editor
Picture this.
Set back on a canal off of Duck
Lake in the middle of Highland,
Mich is a 210 feet-by-115 feet ice
sheet - one larger than an Olym-
pic-sized rink.
A 400-foot wire is strung
lengthwise across the rink, sup-
porting 25 150-watt light fixtures.
It's nine o'clock in the evening and
the frozen pond is considerably
torn up from a day's worth of skat-
ing. This isn't just your average
backyard rink - this is an oasis.
And junior goaltender Bryan
Hogan - when time permits dur-
ing the Michigan hockey team's
hectic year-long schedule - can
be found rifling pucks across this
secluded rink.
Last Sunday night, Hogan, along
with fellow juniors Chad Langlais
and Tristin Llewellyn and Hogan's
father, Jim, played apick-upgame in
the wake of the Wolverines' upcom-
ing outdoor contest against Wiscon-
sin in the Camp Randall Classic.
"I think the only reason why
Chad wanted to come out there
was because we have the game
this weekend," Hogan said with a
slight laugh. "Usually, he doesn't
want to, but I dragged him out
there. It's quite an experience."
His father named it "The Duck
Lake Forum," and when Hogan
makes it there, he can be seen
sporting a blue Rimouski Oceanic
(Sidney Crosby's former Quebec
Major Hockey League team) jersey.
Surprisingly, Hogan rarely ever
wears goalie attire when out on
the pond. His father said he never
expected Hogan to end up between
the pipes, considering he's only
seen his son strap on the pads once
at The Forum since he was 10 or 11.
"It's too cold out there to play
goalie," Hogan said. "No one wants
to play goalie. But (this weekend)
I'm going to have to."
Jim is quick to highlight that
it might have been former NHL
goaltender Ed Belfour - who
Bryan met at a very young age -
who inspired him to throw on a
goalie mask.
Growing up, he consistently
wore No. 20 on his jersey and
exhibited the same sort of art on
his helmet as Belfour.
And while Hogan almost always
plays forward on Duck Lake, this
Saturday against the Badgers, he'll
be Michigan's last line of defense.
He'll have to adjust to the rink,
potential shadows, bright lights and
the overall game-day atmosphere.

luniorgoaltender Bryan Hogan with junior defenseman Tristin Llewellyn (top) play on Hogan's outdoor rink, nicknamed "The
Duck Lake Forum,' in Highland, Mich. The two travel to Madison this weekend to play in the Camp Randall Classic against No. 2
Wisconsin. Hogan (bottom) skates on the same rink, where he prefers to not play goalie,

often they are thrust into an envi-
ronment, for lack of a better word,
artificial environment," Jim said.
"It's on a big stage with bright
lights and it's very structured. And
then you can find a way to escape
that after it's all been placed before
you and you can retreat back to
where it all started, that's special."
The Forum provides that escape
from reality to a place where it all
began. It's a place where a 21-year-
old Division I college hockey
player can recapture his youth,
according to Jim.
It's where teammates and
friends can have a few laughs and
forget about the difficult season
they've had to endure. It's where

a father and son can toss the puck "We started out (last weekend)
around and rekindle the bond with a little two-on-two ... and
they've shared over the years on (Bryan, Chad and Tristin) humored
the ice. But most important, it's me for a little bit and let me be a
part of it," Mr. Hogan said. "I'll
tell you what, when Bryan started
school there, I dreamed of the day
"I dreamed of when he'd bring a few guys up to
play. Those guys don't know it, and
the da when no one else really knows this, but
for me, it was the thrill of alifetime.
he'd bring a few "Someday as a dad, you're going
to look back on your kids and
guys up to play" you're going to share experiences
in their lives - there are going to
be some special moments. It seems
like such a simple thing, but it was
where a son can make a father's something way beyond that. And
day...and not even know it. I'll never forget that."

Blue looks for redemption tonight

ByJOE STAPLETON

When the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team played Northwest-
ern in Crisler Arena on Jan. 10,
the Wolverines gave up a 37-28
halftime lead and allowed the
Wildcats to
get back into a

The key to Ten Network
making sure
nothing like
that happens tonight in Evanston,
accordingto Michigan coach John
Beilein, is simple: defense.
"They got several unguarded
threes when we would say, 'you
got him,' and the other guy would
say, 'you got him,' " Beilein said.
"And nobody took him."
Of course, the reason the

defense suffered is the same rea-
son it has suffered all year. When
the Wolverines (4-5 Big Ten, 11-10
overall) start missing their shots,
they become preoccupied and it
causes them to play distracted
defense.
In the first half of the North-
western game, Michigan shot 50
percent from the field and held the
Wildcats to 34 percent shooting.
In the second half, the two
teamsnearly switched places -
the Wolverines shot 34 percent
and Northwestern (3-6, 14-7) shot
56 percent.
But it wasn't just missed shots
that distracted Michigan on
defense.
Turnovers played a major role
as well. The Wolverines commit-
ted 11 of their 18 turnovers in the
second half.
"We were scoring and we were
feeling good," Beilein said. "Then
all of a sudden, we started turning
it over and we had trouble going
from offense to defense."
Beilein was quick to point out
that the game was not just about
Michigan shooting itself in the
foot.
Northwestern, he said, throws
off a lot of teams the way they

play.
"If you ask Big Ten coaches,
many of them would agree with
me that this is the most difficult
prep of the year," Bilein said.
"Because they play so differently
and right now they're playing as
well as any Northwestern team
we've faced."
The good news for the Wol-
verines is that their defense has
been much improved since that
game. Though they have gone 3-3
in their six games since then, they
have only allowed one opponent,
Connecticut, to score over 60
points.
The main reason for the turn-
around, according to senior
DeShawn Sims, is confidence.
"The defense is there," he said.
"We just needed to implement
some swagger, some confidence.
We just needed to pick up our
swagger in general."
Part of maintaining that swag-
ger is taking the attitude of get-
ting back at Northwestern for
taking what the Wolverines con-
sider was rightfully theirs: a vic-
tory back on Jan. 10
"We definitely owe them one,"
Sims said. "Definitely seeking
redemption."
