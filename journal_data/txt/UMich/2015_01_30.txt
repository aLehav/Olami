Taxi cab drivers 

express grievances 
at lack of rideshare 
service regulation

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Across Michigan, local gov-

ernments have placed regu-
lations 
on 
two 
prominent 

rideshare companies operating 
in the state, Uber and Lyft.

However, breaking from that 

trend, this past August the Ann 
Arbor City Council did not pass 
proposed regulations that would 
have placed significant restric-
tions on these rideshare servic-
es, requiring drivers to register 
with the city, provide proof of 
insurance and obtain a valid 
chauffeur’s license, among other 
regulations. No action has been 
taken on the issue since, leaving 
their status in Ann Arbor uncer-
tain.

Councilmember Sabra Briere 

(D–Ward 1) voted against the 
proposed 
regulations. 
Briere 

said she opposed them because 
she believes that the Ann Arbor 
City Council has not yet figured 

out how to properly handle the 
operating models of companies 
like Uber and Lyft.

“Part of the reason we strug-

gled with this is because the only 
model we have is an old model 
that doesn’t respond to modern 
technology,” Briere said.

Rather, she said the ordinance 

proposed in August treated ride-
share services as if they were 
taxi services, instead of a sepa-
rate entity.

“Trying to make (Uber) oper-

ate like a taxi would destroy it,” 
Briere said.

Though she acknowledged 

that Uber has received negative 
press, she said there are distinct 
benefits to having an accessible 
rideshare service that doesn’t 
require a reservation an hour in 
advance.

“All of the people I have spo-

ken with who use Uber have felt 
comfortable and safe — which is 
not to suggest that every driver is 
perfectly vetted — I don’t know 
whether they are or aren’t,” she 
said. “It’s not to guarantee that 
every driver in every place that 
deals with Uber specifically is 
properly trained and has a prop-
erly safe vehicle, because I can’t 
guarantee those things either. I 

White House 

proposal part of 
effort to aid low-
income families

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULUS

Several education initiatives 

announced by President Barack 
Obama in his annual State of the 
Union address earlier this month 
have garnered both negative and 
positive reactions from the high-
er education community.

During the address, Obama 

announced his intention to both 
expand the American Oppor-
tunity Tax Credit beyond 2017 
and to establish two years of free 
tuition for community college.

The AOTC is part of the Amer-

ican Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act of 2009. It was originally set 
to expire in 2017, but the presi-
dent’s proposal calls for making 
it a permanent part of the tax 
code.

Students who want to use the 

AOTC must be paying tuition 
and/or book expenses. To be 
eligible, the student’s parents or 
guardians need to make less than 
$80,000 if they are a single par-
ent or under $160,000 if there are 
two parents filing a joint tax.

A student can earn a credit 

of up to $2,500 per year. This 

amount would consist of 100 per-
cent of the first $2,000 paid on 
tuition or books and up to 25 per-
cent of the next $2,000. Further-
more, 40 percent of the tax credit 
is refundable if the total amount 
of taxes is lower than the credit 
amount received. The president 
is also proposing to make this 
refundable amount up to $1,500 
on a fixed rather than a percent-
age scale.

Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of 

the Edvisors Network, an orga-
nization that consults parents 
and students on managing col-
lege expenses, said tax subsidies 
have some benefits, but do not 
target many students in the most 
effective manner. He added that 
middle and lower-high income 
students mostly enjoy AOTC 
benefits.

Instead, he said, more effective 

relief for lower-income students, 
who the president identified as a 
target population for his reforms, 
can be found through the High-
er Education Act. The Higher 
Education Act is the mechanism 
through which federal financial 
aid programs such as Pell Grants 
are regulated.

“If they wanted to really tar-

get this at low-income students, 
the people who have the need, 
what they should do is get rid of 
the American Opportunity Tax 
Credit, the Lifetime Learning 
Tax Credit and Tuition and Fees 
Deduction and take the 16 or 17 

‘U’ sophomores 
form Moneythink 
chapter, partner 
with local school

By SAMANTHA WINTNER

For the Daily

After nine months of prepa-

rations, the national organi-
zation Moneythink has made 
its Michigan debut at Skyline 
High School in Ann Arbor.

The group, launched in the 

wake of the 2008 economic 

recession, is dedicated to pro-
viding a financial education to 
high school students through 
college partnerships. Co-presi-
dents Dillon Stuart, a Business 
sophomore, and Greg Lobel, 
an LSA sophomore, have been 
working since April 2014 to 
bring the organization to the 
University.

Stuart said one of the pro-

gram teaches students impor-
tant financial literacy skills 
that they might not receive 
elsewhere.

“We’re teaching them some 

things that I don’t think you 
would normally get from any 

high school curriculum, like 
how to choose a bank, and 
what’s important about that,” 
she said.

Lobel 
initially 
contacted 

the national organization and 
learned they had been interest-
ed in starting a chapter at the 
University for a while. He then 
approached Stuart about start-
ing the chapter, and with the 
help of their adviser, Econom-
ics Lecturer Mitchell Dudley, 
and the national organization. 
Soon, the vision became a real-
ity.

Add this to the list of nomi-

nees for coolest class of the year.

A group of 22 graduate stu-

dents have been working since 
last semester on creating their 

own experiential learning class. 
Called the International Eco-
nomic Development Program, 
the class is through the Ford 
School of Public Policy’s Inter-
national Policy Student Asso-
ciation, and each year consists 
of class work in Ann Arbor fol-
lowed by a spring break trip to a 
foreign country selected by the 
students. This year the group is 
going to Brazil.

The group, consisting mostly 

of Public Policy students but also 
law and natural resource and 
environment students, is in the 

process of studying the country, 
organizing the trip and raising 
money to pay for their travels. 
The class hosted a Brazilian 
cultural night Thursday—“Uma 
Noite Brasileira”— both as a fun-
draiser and educational event for 
the campus.

Lessons on Brazilian dance, 

a performance from the Vence-
dores Samba Bateria drumline 
and Brazil trivia drew a small 
crowd to the Ford School great 
hall. The group generated “a 
couple hundred bucks” in dona-
tions.

The trip is estimated to cost 

between $45,000 and $50,000 
total and the primary funding 
comes from the Ford School, 
the International Institute, the 
William Davidson Institute, the 
Graham Sustainability Institute 
and the Center for Latin Ameri-
can and Caribbean Studies.

The guests Thursday included 

Ford School Dean Susan Collins, 
who said the IEDP program was 
a valuable part of the school.

put together the program to edu-

RE FLECTION RECE P TION

Ann Arbor could 
join municipalities 
in support of same-

sex marriage

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

At the Ann Arbor City Coun-

cil meeting Monday, members 
will discuss filing an amicus brief 
with the U.S. Supreme Court in 
the DeBoer v. Snyder case, along 
with the construction of an air-
port solar installation and a reso-
lution to approve zoning changes 
for a new Plum Market.

Amicus brief

In January 2012, Hazel Park 

couple April DeBoer and Jayne 
Rowse filed a lawsuit challeng-
ing Michigan’s ban on adoption 
by same-sex couples because they 
wanted to adopt each other’s chil-
dren.

Several months after, the cou-

ple changed their suit to instead 
challenge Michigan’s overall ban 
on same-sex marriage at the invi-
tation of U.S. District Judge Ber-
nard Friedman.

In March of last year, Fried-

man ruled that Michigan’s ban on 
same-sex marriage was uncon-
stitutional, leading to a brief 
24-hour period in the state where 
roughly 300 marriages were per-
formed. However, the decision

University leads effort to digitize 
thousands of Old English texts

Project aims to add 
40,000 more works 
to online archive by 

the year 2020

BY NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

After a 16-year University-

led effort, the earliest printed 
texts of modern era writers 
will now be available online 
and for free.

The University Library, the 

University of Oxford’s Bodle-
ian Libraries and the company 
ProQuest have collaborated to 
make more than 25,000 texts 
printed between 1473 to 1700 
available through the Univer-
sity of Michigan library’s web-
site.

According to a press release, 

this effort is only the first 
phase of the Early English 
Books Online Text Creation 

Partnership, which began in 
1999.

In an interview Thursday, 

Aaron McCollough, editorial 
director for Michigan Publish-
ing, said the texts that will be 
available include Shakespeare, 
Chaucer and Homer.

“The 
selection 
process 

focused on books that were 
already believed to be very 
important, for which high 
demand would exist,” McCol-
lough said. “The works of 
famous 
17th 
century 
play-

wrights, prominent philoso-
phers, 
sermon 
literature 

—there are around 25,000 of 
the ‘Greatest Hits,’ in a way, of 
the 17th century.”

ProQuest, an Ann Arbor-

based 
company, 
created 

scanned images of these texts 
in 1999 and published them as 
a database called Early English 
Books Online, but was unable 
to reproduce them into search-
able digital texts.

The entire effort across the 

libraries involved a process 
called double-keying, in which 
two different people type in, 
character by character, the let-
ters from the print documents. 
A program called optical char-
acter recognition can tran-
scribe modern printed works, 
but older texts contain dif-
ferent fonts that the program 
can’t recognize.

The Council on Library and 

Information Resources, Jisc, a 
digital solutions charity, and 
more than 160 other libraries 
also partnered in the project. 
McCollough said the interna-
tional collaboration is one of 
the first of its kind.

“It also is a kind of revolu-

tionary funding model for a big 
knowledge project in humani-
ties — this idea of (sic) consor-
tial collaboration, of multiple 
libraries contributing a feasi-
ble amount of money to a proj-
ect so that something is made 
possible that wouldn’t be pos-
sible for any single library to 
fund,” McCollough said. “That 
kind of model is being replicat-
ed in other contexts, but this 
is one of the first big projects 
like that.”

Overall, McCollough said 

the project will be vitally 
important for English culture 
as a whole.

“This was a very important 

thing in terms of free culture 
and preserving what is a fun-
damental set of texts in the 
history of English-language 
culture,” 
McCollough 
said. 

“It’s also a very large set of 
humanities data that can be 
mined and repurposed for dig-
ital humanities projects, and 
this is one of the great promis-
es of the material at this point: 
to see what scholars will do 
with these texts in the digital 
realm.”

The project hopes to release 

an additional 40,000 texts for 
public consumption by 2020.

Cobo Center 

conference room 
fills with hopeful 

citizens 

DETROIT (AP) — Hundreds 

of Detroit homeowners in dan-
ger of losing their properties 
flocked Thursday to hearings 
that offered a last-ditch chance 
to avoid foreclosure and to 
keep the houses from adding to 
the city’s already huge glut of 
vacant dwellings.

The 
homeowners 
nearly 

filled a long conference room 
in Detroit’s Cobo Center while 
waiting for their cases to be 
heard. Many hoped to work out 
payment plans to ease their tax 
debts under new laws signed 
this month by Republican Gov. 
Rick Snyder.

“Everybody does have a 

story. Most of them are prob-
ably true, because you couldn’t 
make them up if you try,” said 
Eric Sabree, Wayne County’s 
deputy treasurer of land man-
agement. Officials expect more 
than 14,000 property owners 
to seek help over seven days of 
hearings that run through Feb. 

6.

“We have to collect taxes 

by law ... but we definitely do 
not want to take the property,” 
Sabree said. “We want to show 
options that people have to 
save their properties.”

More than 60,000 of the 

county’s 
76,000 
foreclosed 

properties 
are 
in 
Detroit, 

threatening 
neighborhoods 

that have yet to recover from 
the national mortgage crisis.

About $326 million in taxes, 

interest and fees are owed on 
the foreclosed homes, lots and 
other buildings in Detroit. 
Mapping data shows that about 
37,000 of those properties are 
occupied.

“One of the reasons why we 

want people to stay in their 
homes is because when they 
become abandoned, they get 
stripped. They become a crime 
scene. They become a drug 
house,” Sabree said. “It’s bet-
ter to let the person stay in the 
house and collect taxes even 
if it takes longer to collect the 
money.”

Mourice Neal was looking 

for just a little help. His tax bill 
is $4,900 on a home he bought 
in 2013 on Detroit’s North End. 
Paying that amount would 

dangerously stretch what he 
receives in Social Security pay-
ments.

“It’s a good process. They 

are looking at my income,” said 
Neal, who is 46.

But Thomas Jackson left 

his hearing without know-
ing if anything could be done 
with the $27,000 tax bill on his 
home in northwest Detroit. He 
said he was told special con-
sideration was needed to get a 
payment plan. He has another 
hearing next month.

“They told me they can’t 

help me here,” said Jackson, 
40, who has not paid taxes on 
his home since 2012, when he 
lost his automotive job.

He has since found a new job 

and wants to keep the house he 
bought in 2009, but said losing 
it would not be the end of the 
world.

“I’m working now. I can find 

somewhere else,” he said.

Regina Lee, 50, went to the 

hearing ready to pay the $1,200 
owed on two lots that sandwich 
the home she grew up in. She 
said she was unaware her now-
deceased grandmother listed 
her as owner of the lots until 
a relative received a foreclo-
sure notice from the county.

foreclosure from tax debts in Detroit, Thursday, Jan. 29.


billion dollars, whatever the fig-
ure is, and redirect it to the Pell 
Grant program” Kantrowitz said.

The 
University’s 
Office 
of 

Financial Aid said they couldn’t 
say how many students use the 
AOTC because those deductions 
are filed through IRS, not the Uni-
versity.

In light of the president’s sec-

ond proposal, which would make 
two years of community college 
free, Kantrowitz noted that in 
community colleges — where 
more than half of the students are 
typically lower income — tuition 
is already effectively free because 
they already use the Pell Grant 
and AOTC. Thus, the president’s 
second proposal would lead to 
low-income students using less of 
the credit they would be eligible 
for under AOTC.

“So that would actually lead to 

a decrease in the tax credits used 

by low-income students despite 
the expansion of the amount for 
which they are eligible,” Kan-
trowitz said. “It’s difficult to say 
what the impact would be, but I 
believe it sounds good on paper, 
but the reality after implementa-
tion might be substantially differ-
ent.”

Peter Riley Bahr, associate pro-

fessor of education at the Universi-
ty, said reducing the cost of college 
is an important goal, as cheaper 
or free tuition makes access to 
higher education easier. However, 
he also noted that tuitions are not 
the only costs community college 
students incur, as many of them 
face living expenses, family and 
childcare responsibilities.

“We have to remember that 

making a college less expensive is 
a good thing but it’s not a complete 
solution to the financial barriers 
that students face,” he said.

Bahr noted that students who 

enroll in community college do 
so for a diverse range of reasons. 
Some students are not full time 

and not all are seeking to complete 
credentials, but may be retrain-
ing and getting certificates and 
licenses. Therefore, the way the 
program is implemented is also 
important.

“I would hate to see free college 

with strings attached, like ‘You 
must be a full time student, you 
must be these other things,’ that 
may or may not fit, or will not fit 
the college going model for some 
segments of the population,” he 
said.

Bahr said he’s not optimistic 

that the legislature actually imple-
ments the plan due to the political 
climate, but praised Obama for 
highlighting the issue.

“He has done many things 

well, but one thing he has done 
really well in his administration 
is draw attention to the value and 
significance of community col-
leges in our society today,” Bahr 
said. “There is no question that 
community colleges are playing a 
larger educational training role in 
our society and our economy.”

cate people on Brazil culture and 
have this lovely evening,” she 
said.

The IEDP class curriculum 

and trip itinerary were planned 
entirely by the students. Stu-
dents applied to the program last 
September and have been orga-
nizing the class since November 
2013. They will be in Brazil for 
the duration of spring break.

Chanera Pierce, a Public Pol-

icy graduate student, said the 
IEPD program was the reason 
she chose the University in the 
first place.

“One of the most attractive 

features was the opportunity 
to not only critically examine 
a country but to actually visit,” 
Pierce said. “I saw that and I was 
like, ‘One, I will be at this school; 
two, I am going to do this pro-
gram.’ ”

Rory Pulvino, a dual-degree 

graduate student in Law and 
Public Policy, is group president 
and said the IEDP program also 
drew him to the school. Pul-
vino said Brazil’s wide array 
of socio-economic populations 
paired well with his interest in 
economic development abroad—
compelling him to propose Bra-
zil originally.

The goal for the class is to 

learn about Brazil’s policies 
through direct contact with the 
country’s stakeholders. Students 
are researching five focus areas 
— economic development, social 
welfare, environmental issues, 
urban planning and security —
and producing policy analysis 
papers following their visit.

Pulvino said the group will 

meet with representatives from 
Brazilian organizations like the 
Ministry of Cities, the Ministry 
of Science, Technology and Inno-
vation and the Ministry of Social 
Development, among others.

“I’m interested in land issues, 

property issues and natural 
resource management and Bra-
zil obviously has a lot of these 
issues,” he said. “They have the 
Amazon, which is obviously a 
massive global natural resource 
that needs to be managed, hope-
fully correctly. They also have 
urban issues that are very inter-
esting, especially in terms of 
property laws.”

Matthew Manning, a Public 

Policy graduate student, was one 
of the members who worked on 
creating the original syllabus for 
the class. He said it was impor-
tant to both educate everyone 
on Brazil before the trip, as well 
as prepare the group with skills 
like public speaking. He said the 
prospect of getting final papers 
published is also appealing to 
many in the group.

Also included in the curricu-

lum are frequent posts to a pub-
lic blog and presentations to the 
class on students’ respective Bra-
zil research.

“The website right now, what 

we want, our vision for it is to 
be kind of like a resource on just 
Brazil in general to build up a 
following of people,” Manning 
said. “We wanted to incorporate 
a strong writing element. And 
of course presentation skills are 
very important in a professional 
environment so we wanted to 
also have this presentation.”

While still in Ann Arbor, the 

group is contacting to experts on 
Brazil and urban issues to learn 
from first-hand sources. Man-
ning said he recently scheduled 
for Paulo Sotero, director of the 
Wilson Center’s Brazil Institute 
in Washington, D.C., to visit in 
February.

Though the IEDP program has 

run since 2000 — with students 
traveling to countries like China, 
Peru, Jordan and others — this 
year’s trip is made unique by its 
advising professor: Public Policy 
Prof. Melvyn Levitsky, who was 

the U.S. ambassador to Brazil 
from 1994 to 1998. His resume 
also includes serving on the Unit-
ed Nations Economic and Social 
Council and other senior-level 
positions throughout a 35-year 
career as a diplomat.

Levitsky, 
who 
surprised 

guests Thursday with a rendition 
of “The Girl From Ipanema,” said 
he hopes to offer an extra level 
of insight to the students from 
his own experiences in Brazil. 
Levitsky said another goal for 
the trip is outreach to the com-
munity, establishing connections 
with organizations to create a 
two-way street of collaboration 
between Brazil and the Universi-
ty. He said he hopes to encourage 
students in the area to apply to 
the University and also establish 
an internship opportunity for 
current University students this 
summer—a common goal of each 
IEDP program.

Manning, Burdette and Pierce 

all said Brazil actually shares 
similar racial and social issues to 
the United States, both today and 
throughout history. However, 
they said most Americans are 
unfamiliar with those parallels. 
These topics include police bru-
tality, racial tensions and poverty 
in the favelas, or Brazilian slums.

Pierce 
has 
already 
done 

research on Brazil’s social poli-
cies. She said her report on Bra-
zil’s “Minha Casa Minha Vida” 
(My House My Life) national 
housing policy gives her a head 
start on exploring the country 
next month. More specifically, 
Pierce is interested in further 
exploring the country’s racial 
tensions and how the laws affect 
Afro-Brazilians.

“Just because they didn’t 

have a formal and institutional-
ized policy that supported dis-
crimination does not mean their 
ongoing policies did not implic-
itly 
support 
discrimination,” 

she said. “So, you have the Black 
community having the lowest 
literacy rates, or they are largely 
not employed in white-collar 
positions.”

Another interest for many 

students is the economic impact 
of the 2016 Rio Olympics. Man-
ning and others explained how 
opposition groups to the Olym-
pics have sprouted following the 
2014 World Cup in Brazil, with 
many Brazilians seeing the event 
as doing more financial harm 
than good for the population as a 
whole after mismanagement and 
possible corruption.

Manning said he’s looking 

into arranging meetings with 
both the Olympic committee and 
opposition groups in Rio.

Levitsky said he’s also excited 

for the students to work through 
the planning process of a diplo-
matic trip.

“If somebody’s doing a trip, 

like the President of the United 
States, to the director of a sec-
tion in a non-governmental orga-
nization, the trip is not for fun. 
They’re going to find out and try 
to learn how, actually, Brazil has 
done quite a bit better in terms of 
growth—although the last couple 
years aren’t as good—than so 
many other countries.”

According to the CIA World 

Factbook, Brazil ranked eighth 
globally in gross domestic prod-
uct in 2013. Many of the students 
in the class said their peers who 
are less familiar with the coun-
try tend to short sell its success, 
considering it a “developing” 
country rather than a major 
global force.

“In reality, it’s a much more 

complex story on the ground,” 
said Lauren Burdette, a Pub-
lic Policy graduate student. “If 
you don’t actually learn the 
history of a country and learn 
what’s actually happening on 
the ground, you run the danger 
of making a lot of assumptions 
of what life is actually like there 
and assumptions can make real-
ly bad policy.”

whom I’ve spoken to felt safe.”

Safety questions surrounding 

Uber’s operation is just one facet 
of the Uber controversy, which 
has emerged internationally as 
well.

In Ann Arbor, local taxi ser-

vice owners and operators have 
raised financial concerns in addi-
tion to the safety concerns raised 
by members of the community 
and City Council.

Merlyn Wade, owner of Ann 

Arbor Cab, has been in the taxi 
business for almost 30 years. He 
submitted a five-page testimony 
to state legislators, outlining the 
flaws in a Michigan House of 
Representatives bill proposed 
in December. The bill called for 
statewide mandatory permits, 
insurance and screening for driv-
ers for services such as Uber and 
Lyft.

Wade said, if passed, the bill 

would have allowed Uber to con-

tinue operating the same way it 
has been, without following reg-
ulations taxicabs have to follow.

“They would have been able 

to operate without a chauffeur’s 
license, 
without 
commercial 

insurance, without commercial 
plating,” he said.

He added that those rules are 

put in place to protect both the 
passenger and the driver in a 
taxi.

“They might seem archaic, but 

they’re there for a reason,” Wade 
said. “And the rules and the reg-
ulations that we have to follow 
out here are not excessive.”

Wade also noted the unfair 

advantage he sees in the Uber 
business model.

“I have a wife who’s termi-

nally ill and I’ve got five chil-
dren I’m trying to feed, and I 
follow the rules and I come out 
here, just like my drivers do, and 
these guys are allowed to come 
out here and operate illegally, 
and take food off the table of my 
family? How is that right?” Wade 
said.

“I don’t have a problem with 

Uber doing business. I have a 

problem with Uber not following 
the same rules everybody else 
follows,” he added.

John Etter, president of Blue 

Cab Company, expressed simi-
lar views. His cab company pays 
$5,000 to $10,000 per car a year.

“To have a competitor that 

doesn’t have to pay that? That 
doesn’t seem right,” Etter said.

Etter said he has seen busi-

ness suffer as a result of Uber, 
especially with the student mar-
ket on weekend nights.

In response to the new tech-

nology Uber on which operates, 
Etter said Blue Cab is working 
to develop an app of its own, 
which would allow customers to 
see where the cars are and keep 
their credit cards on file.

While taxi companies attri-

bute a drop in customers due 
to Uber, Ann Arbor taxis them-
selves are not immune to safety 
concerns from the community. 
In 2013, the Ann Arbor News 
reported a Blue Cab taxi driver 
was arraigned for two misde-
meanor 
assault 
and 
battery 

charges after a female customer 
reported he kissed her.

was stayed a day later, mean-
ing no more same-sex marriages 
could be performed in the state 
pending an appeal by the state to 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Sixth Circuit. In November, the 
Sixth Circuit reversed the district 
court’s decision, upholding the 
state’s ban.

Following the Sixth Circuit 

decision, DeBoer and Rowse 
appealed 
their 
case 
to 
the 

Supreme Court.

Earlier this month, the U.S. 

Supreme Court agreed to take 
up the case, consolidating it with 
three other similar cases from 
other states in the Sixth Circuit.

The Ann Arbor City Council 

will vote on Monday to decide 
whether or not Ann Arbor will be 
listed as a “Supporting Municipal-
ity” in this Supreme Court case.

By approving the listing, Coun-

cil members will state that the city 
is in favor of legalization of same-
sex marriage in the state.

Solar installation

Council members will also 

discuss a resolution to approve 
a license agreement with DTE 
Energy to build a solar installa-
tion at the Ann Arbor Municipal 
Airport.

If passed, the city will grant 

DTE the use of Ann Arbor city 
property to install and operate 
photovoltaic systems.

Photovoltaic systems, which 

consist of solar panels and solar 
converters, are sources of usable 
solar power.

If the resolution passes, the 

system will be installed in two 
phases. The contract states that 
the installation will be completed 
on or before December 31, 2017.

Plum Market Rezoning and 

Site Plan

The Ann Arbor Planning Com-

mission has outlined a rezoning 
and site plan for the potential 

opening of a Plum Market on 
Plymouth Road.

Plum Market, which also has a 

store on North Maple Road, sells 
groceries with an emphasis on 
local and organic products.

The proposal is to rezone 2.96 

acres from their designation as a 
Planned Unit Development dis-
trict to a C3, Fringe Commercial 
district, which would permit the 
existing 25,000 sq. ft. building on 
the land to be used as a grocery 
store.

The plan also proposes the con-

struction of a 4,639 square foot 
addition to the building’s north 
side, as well as an outdoor patio.

Construction costs are estimat-

ed to be $300,000.

The plan also recommended 

that the retail center be acces-
sible to pedestrians. In addition, 
it encouraged mass transit access 
and a reduction of the demand for 
parking. Bicycle lanes and side-
walks were also recommended on 
both sides of Plymouth Road.

team, the group currently has 
more than a dozen mentors.

Business sophomore Lauren 

Dodge, one of the mentors, said 
the organization gives her to pur-
sue objectives outside of her aca-
demic path.

“I always had a passion for 

business and I was torn between 
whether I wanted to go into 
business or I wanted to go into 
teaching,” Dodge said. “So when 
I heard about Moneythink, I real-
ized that it combined both of my 
passions.”

At Skyline High School, the 

group mentors a class of seniors 
in the school’s three-year busi-
ness magnet program.

Michelle Wargo, a business, 

marketing and information tech-
nology teacher at Skyline, who 
leads the program, said students 
have voiced positive feedback 
about the program so far.

“Financial literacy is really 

important, and I think wherever 
they can get that is great,” Wargo 
said. “And they get the best of 
both worlds with this program 
— they get to have mentors in col-
lege and they get to bond with 
them over other things as well, 
plus learn financial literacy.”

At the beginning of each week, 

Stuart and Lobel teach mentors 
curriculum for the upcoming Fri-
day. The national team provides 
individual lesson topics to help 
guide each chapter, but there is 
some flexibility based on student 
interest, Dodge said.

“We mend the curriculum to 

keep them engaged and make the 
topics relatable to their lives,” she 
said.

Because the Skyline students 

are enrolled in a business pro-
gram, most have already had 
some 
exposure 
to 
financial 

knowledge and skills, either from 
their parents or jobs, Stuart said.

“Especially (because) the les-

sons we’ve had so far have been 
pretty easy, we want to make sure 
they’re still engaged and taking it 
seriously,” Stuart said. “So we’ve 
been stepping it up a bit, and com-
bining two lessons into one.”

The organization also uses 

a smartphone application that 
encourages students to practice 
the skills they’ve learned outside 
of the classroom. One week, stu-
dents were asked to take a picture 
of their bank. The next, they were 
asked to take pictures of purchas-
es they spent money and saved 
money on, and to elaborate on 
whether or not those were good 
purchases.

Moneythink uses a point sys-

tem to incentivize out-of-class 
participation: each time students 
do these tasks they earn points, 
and at the end of the semester the 
group that has earned the most 
points will win a prize.

Before Moneythink started at 

Skyline, its mentors also under-
went an orientation that taught 
them how to serve as effective 
role models to the high school 
students, rather than just a friend.

“Moneythink emphasizes the 

mentor role,” Stuart said. “So, one 
mentor will have a group of stu-
dents, and it’s the same mentor 
going back to the same students 
every week. This way, they devel-
op a pretty strong relationship.”

Mentors usually work with 

groups no larger than four stu-
dents to allow for this relation-
ship to develop.

Stuart said she and Lobel are 

currently working on reaching 
out to both Huron and Pioneer 
High Schools in Ann Arbor to 
hopefully expand the program.

Their ultimate goal is to have 

one or two partner schools in 
Detroit by fall 2016.

“In Ann Arbor, it’s not the first 

time (the students) are hearing 
about (financial planning),” Stu-
art said. “We want to have a good 
understanding of what we’re 
doing before we reach out to a 
school that needs us a bit more.”

WEST PALM BEACH
Treasure hunter 
eluded police with 
cash and tradecraft

A deep-sea treasure hunter 

who vanished during a court 
fight over his $50 million haul 
of gold bars and coins eluded 
capture by hiding in a two-room 
hotel suite under a fake name, 
paying for everything in cash and 
keeping a low-profile, authorities 
said Thursday.

When 
Tommy 
Thompson 

and his longtime companion did 
leave the hotel room, usually 
alone and her more than him, 
they would use a combination of 
buses, taxis and walking around 
to shake anyone who might be 
tailing them.

Thompson, 62, was wanted 

after he failed to appear in an 
Ohio courtroom in 2012 in a law-
suit about the gold he brought 
up in 1988 from a 19th century 
shipwreck. Two investors who 
had funded Thompson’s dream 
to find the shipwreck sued, as did 
some of his crew members, who 
said they also had been cheated 
out of their share.

who 
mysteriously 

disappeared more than two 
years ago and whose remains 
were found in a northern Los 
Angeles County desert area in 
October.

John Lenzie Creech, 42, was 

charged Thursday with 57-year-
old Gavin Smith’s death, accord-
ing to the Los Angeles County

T

his past week, my friends and I saw 
the movie “Selma” (now in theaters 
near you!). The movie is based on 

the marches for voting 
rights during the peak of 
the Civil Rights Move-
ment of the 1960s. These 
marches, which spanned 
from Selma to Montgom-
ery, Alabama, were led by the Southern Chris-
tian Leadership Conference and Student 
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and 
ultimately encouraged the passing of the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965. The movie is directed 
by Ava DuVernay, the first Black female direc-
tor to be nominated for a Golden Globe Award 
and the first Black woman 
to win the Best Director 
Prize at Sundance Film 
Festival. While the original 
script was written by Paul 
Webb, a British white man, 
a woman of color was wise-
ly chosen to direct the film.

“Selma” is a beautiful 

film with a triumphant mes-
sage: When we organize and 
unite in nonviolent protest, 
we can create a significant 
difference in this country. 
We can work against racial injustice and pre-
vail with new civil rights, such as the Voting 
Rights Act.

Yet with some basic knowledge of Ameri-

can current events, there is also a deeper, 
more jarring message coded throughout the 
film: Selma is now.

I am a white female. I am an ally of the 

movement and cannot claim these struggles 
as my own. But the movement for justice 
among all races — that is everyone’s political 
issue. Silence is violence, and we must learn 
from the evolution of movements that have 
come before us. I write this article because 
“Selma” reminded me that we have not come 
this far just to historicize the Civil Rights 
Movement while we munch on popcorn and 
slurp Coca-Cola (not that popcorn and Coke 
are bad ideas). Rather, we must use it as fuel 
to continue our (painfully) slow but steady 
evolution towards equality.

As I watched the film, I couldn’t help but 

relate so many of the scenes to modern-day 
battles in the fight for equality. Even the most-
brutal of scenes in “Selma” seemed to trig-
ger the thought of some modern struggle. As 
protestors in the movie were gassed, beaten, 
whipped and just generally violently attacked 
by police officers on the road to Montgom-
ery, who wasn’t thinking of Michael Brown 
in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and all 
of the people of color publicized in the papers 
recently that have been attacked or killed by 
law enforcement officers? Peaceful protests 
against police brutality in Berkeley, Califor-
nia were met with even more police brutality. 
A man who honked his horn at police officers 
blocking his driveway was beaten and tased.

The current criminal jus-

tice system has been called 
the new Jim Crow. It has 
been compared in many 
logical ways to the systemic 
oppression of slavery. The 
“war against drugs” has 
sent millions into the com-
plex, most of them people of 
color. We continue desper-
ate efforts to dismantle the 
school-to-prison 
pipeline. 

Schools are legally segre-
gating due to income dis-

parities and the increasing wealth gap.

We are still fighting our way from Selma 

to Montgomery. We are still fighting for the 
safety of Black children on the street. We 
speak of the nuances of white privilege and 
the invisible backpack, and this is all very 
important and true. But there is also the 
matter of the visible anvil resting heavily on 
everyone’s back, one that forces us to deal 
with matters of life and death, slavery and 
freedom, imprisonment and justice.

We have come a long way, and that should 

not be denied or forgotten. But many of our 
institutional forms of oppression have sim-
ply taken another form. The fight is not 
over, and while we ponder the real ingre-
dients in the artificially buttered popcorn 
of our dark movie theater, we must also 
ponder the “Selma” of today. Selma is now.

Selma is now

L

ast week brought perhaps 
the holiest day to our cam-
pus, a day of reverence and 

devotion for the 
furry 
friends 

that 
scamper 

around us. Yes, 
Squirrel Appre-
ciation Day had 
arrived, and for 
the 
one 
place 

in 
the 
world 

where the usual 
nuisances 
are 

daily 
acquain-

tances, this day 
was a reminder 
of just how weird campus really 
 is sometimes.

It was a day celebrated on the Uni-

versity’s official Instagram with a 
post by two people in squirrel masks 
hilariously giving random hugs and 
high fives to students on the Diag, 
courtesy of the brilliant people 
behind @umich_squirrels. With an 
official mascot no longer existing in 
the wild in our own state, it seems 
we have turned to some other furred 
quadrupedal creature to suit our 
needs. We’ve replaced one of the most 
ferocious creatures in the wild — the 
wolverine — with another whose big-
gest claim to fame is bringing down 
the NASDAQ Stock Market twice by 
being electrocuted from running on 
power lines.

Then not only do we make enough 

of a spectacle about squirrels that one 
of our librarians has taken 11,000 pic-
tures of them, but we create an official 
school club dedicated to feeding them.

I had tenuous relationships with 

squirrels before coming to college. 
They went to terrorizing lengths to 
gain entrance in the trash cans in our 
garage, to the point where we had to 
trap them in our own yard and release 
them at a park. I once hit too many wif-
fle balls over the fence when I was a kid, 
and knowing I would get grounded, I 

decided to blame it on squirrels steal-
ing all the balls instead. Another time, 
one got trapped in our garage while 
we were gone on vacation and over a 
few days went full X-Men Wolverine 
and clawed a full two inches through 
brick trying to get out. Perhaps the 
strangest was the day I got home from 
school and was met face to face with a 
squirrel just chilling on my living room 
couch — still can’t 
explain that one.

So 
arriving 

on campus and 
watching 
the 

ballooned 
ver-

sions of the crea-
tures that people 
in my neighbor-
hood once killed 
with rat poison 
was perhaps the 
largest culture shock I would experi-
ence. While Ann Arbor is full of col-
lege students subsiding on the ramen 
noodle diet, the most well fed crea-
tures in our city were football-shaped 
rodents with a bushy tail.

It defied all common sense, but so 

have squirrels for the greater course 
of their relationship with humans. 
Back home, squirrel roadkill was 
regular enough that you were bound 
to see one every block, with rotat-
ing animal control trucks coming to 
shovel them up. One would think that 
natural selection would eventually 
cause the demise of squirrels dumb 
enough to dart directly into the path 
of a moving car, but nope, the miracle 
of nature finds a way again.

The squirrels here in Ann Arbor 

escape explanation for all the oppo-
site reasons. During football sea-
son, SBNation writer Spencer Hall 
took his first trip to Ann Arbor to 
cover a game and the first thing he 
tweeted was “First Michigan obser-
vation: BOLD SQUIRRELS.” I had 
a friend from North Carolina visit 
for the first time over the summer, 

and the first thing he did when we 
walked into the Diag was spend 
10 straight minutes running after 
our squirrels trying to catch one. 
 

He failed.

I asked a lot of hard questions. 

How are the squirrels so revered 
here? What did they do to deserve 
it? If God made everything, did he 
really make squirrels too? What 

is 
the 
mean-

ing of squirrel 
life? How can I 
become 
aware 

to 
this 
full-

ness of truth in 
devotion to this 
 

campus wildlife?

I 
grappled 

with questioning 
this 
existential 

reality. I tried 

buying a Michigan Squirrels shirt. 
I even tried to feed one once, but it 
wouldn’t come near me, perhaps 
sensing my apprehension. I looked 
up to the trees and asked them to 
speak of meaning and answers to the 
continual confusion.

It hit me one day. I was walking 

through the Diag, heard a snap and 
looked up once more to the trees. 
Falling from the skies was both a 
large branch and just behind it a 
squirrel. And it hit me. The squirrel 
hit my shoulder, rolled off onto the 
walkway, and scampered away as I 
stood there in awe.

Every day I still walk through 

campus and stare at the squir-
rels, forever in awe that however 
round they may be, they can still 
scurry up and down trees with 
such swiftness. Some things just 
have to be experienced and left 
unexplainable, 
perhaps 
some-

thing even as inconsequential as 
 

our squirrels.

On squirrels

“When I walked out of Angola, I 

didn’t realize how permanently the 
experience of solitary would mark 
me,” said Benjamin Sklar, a prison-
er held in solitary confinement for 
29 years.

The isolated torture of one’s 

psyche is not even remotely an 
acceptable or humane punish-
ment, yet it is still used consistently 
behind the walls of our prison sys-
tem. Atul Gawande, a surgeon and 
public health researcher, stated in 
The New Yorker, “Human beings 
are social creatures … to exist as 
a normal human being requires 
interaction with other people.”

During a lecture on the United 

Nations rapporteur on torture, 
Juan Mendez, a visiting law pro-
fessor at American University, 
addressed the duties of assessing 
international and domestic pris-
ons based on guidelines set by the 
UN according to the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. He 
encountered friction when trying 
to receive consent to inspect pris-
ons in politically closed countries, 
such as Russia and Korea. However, 
what perhaps is more surprising 
was the refusal of U.S. federal and 
state penitentiary systems to allow 
him to inspect their facilities. With 
only a handful of prisons allowing 
him full access to inspection, the 
UN must refuse to give any official 
reports on prison conditions in a 
given country.

The mandates set by the UN on 

prisoner treatment are a check and 
balance system to hold governments 
accountable, however the duration 
and severity of solitary confinement 
creates widespread disagreement 
on the definition of torture. Benja-
min Wallace-Wells, New York Mag-
azine columnist, presents a piece 
on the government’s use of soli-
tary confinement with the parallel 
effects of brutal torture on inmates. 

The piece in New York Magazine 
translated the events of a peniten-
tiary-wide hunger strike to alleviate 
the harsh conditions of confinement 
in one of California’s highest secu-
rity prisons. The Pelican Bay Secu-
rity Housing inmates are isolated in 
concrete cells for the entirety of the 
day with only one hour to exercise 
in a personal cage outside. Wells’ 
research led him to look more close-
ly into the account of a gang mem-
ber placed at Pelican Bay for serious 
crimes. Although the inmate had 
previously led a life that many peo-
ple would consider dangerous and 
against social norms, he described 
solitary confinement as almost 25 
years of “continuous torture.”

From a historical perspective, 

the Geneva Convention relative to 
the Treatment of Prisoners of War 
demonstrated a framework that 
was drafted and signed by the U.S. 
as well as 95 international govern-
ments. It reflected upon universal 
moral views for the treatment of 
foreign prisoners. In Article 3 of the 
Convention, it is stated that no pris-
oners shall endure “outrages upon 
personal dignity,” as well as Article 
30 which addresses isolation wards 
solely as outlets to protect patient 
prisoners and garner healing rather 
than mental wear.

In countering against the aboli-

tion of solitary confinement, author 
Robert Rogers argues that prisoner 
isolation can help protect younger 
inmates from the influences of 
career criminals. The report exam-
ines the positive effects of keep-
ing extremely volatile prisoners 
away from other inmates, noting 
a decrease in riots as well as a less 
significant presence of prison gangs 
and violence. This also affects the 
young prisoners released from jail; 
once back in society, they could 
be swayed to carry on crimes 
because of their time spent with 
 

career criminals.

In 
reports 
by 
correctional 

researcher Paige Ferguson from 
prisons in Washington state , the 
state facilities used an experimen-
tal program on those same volatile 
inmates with long-term mental 
health counseling. Attention to 
mental health stimulated positive 
effects in prisoners, thus resulting 
in a smaller number of participants 
returning to isolation for behavior-
al correction. Ferguson also points 
to the effects of solitary confine-
ment on society once prisoners 
are released. Without consistent 
socialization, ex-convicts are prone 
to revert back to crime when faced 
with the task of re-assimilating to 
normal society. Programs of exten-
sive mental health aid and counsel-
ing would be increasingly beneficial 
substitutes to the harsh implica-
tions of solitary confinement.

Beyond Ferguson’s findings, I 

feel our country would be able to 
bypass the abusive policies of pris-
oner segregation if there was better 
mediation on what crimes war-
ranted prison time. If perpetrators 
of petty crimes were sentenced to 
more public works and community 
service instead of jail time, it would 
allow for a larger budget for men-
tal health programs within pris-
ons and, at the same time, benefit 
communities with the work of less 
threatening offenders.

While solitary confinement may 

work as a means of prisoner pro-
tection, its overuse has become a 
mentally damaging form of torture 
in the U.S. prison system. Segregat-
ing problematic members of soci-
ety needs to be disassociated as an 
acceptable practice. Instead, the 
correctional facilities should focus 
on improving the mental health and 
well-being of inmates.

Psychedelic Pond

Australian 

alternative band 
is reminiscent of 

MGMT

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

What’s 
happening 
down 

under? Trippy stuff, man — the 
good (see: Tame Impala), the ugly 
and the decent. In the latter cat-
egory lies the 
weirdest named 
of the Austra-
lian psychedelic 
revival groups, 
Pond. 
Current 

members 
Nick 

Allbrook, 
Jay 

Watson, Joseph 
Ryan and Jamie 
Terry fill the 
lineup, though 
Pond was origi-
nally 
intended 

to be, in true hippy fashion, a 
fluid, come-and-go-as-you-please 
collaborative project. 

These water boys have since 

released 
an 
impressive 
five 

albums, even with three of their 
members double-dipping in the 
Tame Impala pool — a band whose 
pool, in comparison to Pond’s, 
seems a little crisper, more fresh. 
Regardless, Pond’s latest addi-
tion to their repertoire, Man It 
Feels Like Space Again, is indeed a 
return to extremely psychedelic, 

space-y rock with many shining, 
listenable moments. Yet, it seems 
one-noted and boring, even — lost 
in space. Also, is that title sup-
posed to be a Shania Twain allu-
sion? We’ll never know.

“Waiting Around for Grace” 

is a representative, adequate 
start. It’s an enjoyable, MGMT-
esque number graced with weird 
synths that somehow work with 
a catchy beat. “Zond,” a distant-
sounding tune following a more 
formulaic structure (solid beat, 
verses and a main chorus), man-
ages to capture pop appeal with 
psychedelic flair. It’s undeniably 
spacey, though, complete with 
Bowie-like interludes and synths 
that put it at the front of the run-
ning for a new Rainbow Road 
theme song. Both songs prove 
listenable as hell without losing 
the “trip” factor — an admirable 
accomplishment.

At points, the album is down-

right fun — Pond reminds us that 
this is a key ingredient in the 
often-too-chill genre of psyche-
delic rock. “Elvis’ Flaming Star” 
starts like some ’80s dance tune 
a la “Footloose” and turns into a 

funky, slightly echoey, cool grove. 
“Outside Is The Right Side” glis-
tens as the best track on the album 
— its wah-wah guitar, synths and 
badass energy make it dance-y 
rather than fancy or caught up in 
the existential intricacies of sit-
ting by a river (i.e., “Holding Out 
for You,” a lovely yawn-fest). 

It all starts to go downhill 

from there; quality and tempo 
slow down. The best of this shit-
ty (intended), glacial bunch is 
“Heroic Shart,” an uncomfort-
ably sensual song about, well, 
you guessed it. It’s so out there 
and odd that, in addition to being 
barely listenable, it’s not memora-
ble in the slightest, as hard as that 
is with a title like that. “Sitting 
On Our Crane” is slow done right, 
but it’s overpowered by the medi-
ocrity of numbers like “Medicine 
Hat.” This one gives acoustic 
undertones a shot and sounds a 
lot like of those bar songs that, 
when you’re plastered next to 
your friends, you’re definitely 
rocking to. But sober, it’s not that 
good.

The ironic worst of the album 

is the title track, an 8-minute 
attempted epic that results in a 
grand hot mess. Luckily for us, 
there is a plethora of great psy-
chedelic bands out there these 
days; Australia is contributing 
to this growing population. And 
though the quest to find those 
bands sometimes takes a little 
hunting and gathering, there are 
plenty of fish in the pond. Take a 
stab.

Who even are these guys?

‘Grantchester’ is 
comfortable viewing

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

“Grantchester,” 
the 
latest 

installment of PBS’s “Master-
piece Mystery!” 
is a new offer-
ing for lovers of 
phenomenons 
such as “Down-
ton 
Abbey,” 

“Agatha Chris-
tie’s Marple” or 
“Sherlock,” and 
the 
premiere 

promises 
that 

it will be just 
as 
entertain-

ing, if not more 
so, as the rest. “Grantchester” 
has all the makings of a com-
fortable 1950’s period drama: 
a sexy, unobtainable protago-
nist who solves crimes when 
he’s not preaching the word of 
God, beautiful shots of English 
countryside, women with killer 
lipstick slyly dropping hints, 
adulterous affairs and, of course, 
a suicide case that is much more 
complicated than it seems.

James Norton (“Happy Val-

ley”) plays Sidney Chambers, 
a young vicar with a chiseled 
jawline and soulful eyes who 
unintentionally invites the con-
fidence of those around him. 
After presiding over a funeral of 
a man who has apparently com-
mitted suicide, he is approached 
by a young woman who tells him 
in between puffs of cigarette 
smoke that there’s reason to 
believe the dead man was mur-
dered — namely, the fact that he 
was unhappy in his marriage and 
was having an affair. Chambers 
agrees to investigate, irritat-
ing Inspector Geordie Keating, 
(Robson 
Green, 
“Touching 

Evil”), a grumpy, skeptical cop 
who eventually realizes it would 

behoove him to work with the 
vicar rather than get in his way. 
The two become friends as they 
pry into village affairs and poke 
their noses into the details of 
the murdered man’s former life, 
eventually solving the crime in a 
tidy 50 minutes.

“Grantchester,” albeit predict-

able, somehow manages to feel 
refreshing. It follows the for-
mulas of crime procedurals and 
period dramas, from the elegant 
adornments of the mantlepiece 
that remind the dead man’s wife 
of their honeymoon to the gentle 
piano background music to the 
vicar’s morally upright landlady 
(Tessa 
Peak-Jones, 
“Poirot”). 
 

But it adds bits of tongue-in-
cheek humor that keep the show 
relevant, especially concerning 
the tension between the reli-
gious and secular aspects of the 
not-so-sleepy little town. 

Norton’s portrayal of his char-

acter as pleasant and open, rather 
than cynical and reclusive — as 
is characteristic of many of our 
favorite crime-solving heroes — 
also feels fresh. When Chambers 
figures out that he has solved the 
crime, based on a second closer 

reading of the supposed suicide 
note that actually is describing 
the man’s desire to end a rela-
tionship, not his life, Chamber’s 
excitement is palpable; he takes 
time to check on the people 
involved, instead of moving right 
on to the next crime with a yawn 
and glass of whiskey (although 
that comes later as well, to the 
constant surprise of people who 
insist on offering him sherry). 
Even the fact that he clearly 
has feelings for his adventurous 
friend Amanda Kendall, (Mor-
ven Christie, “Case Histories”) 
who has a new ring on her finger, 
doesn’t embitter him — not yet, 
anyway. 

Don’t look for deviations from 

the script in “Grantchester,” 
because you won’t find them. 
There are no plot twists that 
break the pattern of a 50-min-
ute mystery series — but there 
doesn’t need to be. “Grantches-
ter” may feel familiar, but it’s the 
kind of familiar that goes along 
with curling up on the couch 
holding a pint of ice cream and a 
blanket on Sunday nights — the 
kind that we all need, at least 
every once in a while.

How I learned to love 
Rome and not cry
I 

always cry when I get to 
Rome. My ocular aqueducts 
dry up after a minute or two, 

but right after I deposit my bag in 
the corner, I 
always find 
myself rest-
ing my head 
against a 
hard wall, 
taking one 
long breath 
and letting 
a few salty 
drops fall to 
the floor.

These 

are not tears of joy or elation or 
even exhaustion. They are tears of 
anxiety.

If that sounds like the most 

ridiculous 
thing 
you’ve 
ever 

heard, I don’t blame you. And it is 
a bit ridiculous. But allow me to 
explain.

Having some sort of passion is 

always a good thing, be it paint-
ing or polo or parcheesi. It sets 
you apart from others. It gives 
you a niche. But a passion for 
food sounds exceedingly normal, 
even necessary, like a passion for 
breathing or sleeping. 

By the time I was 12, I knew 

food was the only thing that really 
interested me, the only thing that 
I could read and write and talk 
about without end. But everyone 
around me liked food too. To set 
myself apart, I approached food 
with a near-academic obses-
sion. I read cookbooks. I watched 
documentaries on chef’s knives 
and cheesemaking. I kept track 
of what the best restaurants in 
the world had on their menus, 
even though most of them were in 
France or Spain. I was determined 
to be more than someone who 
liked to eat.

My upbringing only strength-

ened this desire. As you might have 
glossed from my name, I grew up 
in a family that was consciously, 
and conspicuously, more Italian 
than Italian-American. We said 
“parmigiano,” not “parmesan,” 
and only ate spaghetti with meat-
balls on Christmas. Pretentious 
little foodie that I was, I loved it 
— being Italian seemed more cere-
bral. My father, born and raised in 
North Jersey, was the inspiration 
for all of this, for which I am more 
and more thankful as I get older. 
He talked about food in Italy, and 
Rome in particular, like he talked 
about the novels of Henry James 
and Pedro Martinez’s split-finger 
fastball: that it was an unrivaled 
sublime, the summa of the genre, 
the platonic ideal. By the time I 
actually went to Italy, I assumed 
even a stick of gum there would 
merit a Michelin star.

This is why I get so anxious 

when I arrive in Rome. I assume 
that food is split between whorish 
tourist traps, and the gastronomic 
Madonnas, and it’s up to me to 
find the latter. Every meal is a test, 
where I determine if I have found 
the flawless food that I so often 
dreamed of. Here’s how bad it can 
get: I once refused to eat a slice of 
pizza late on a boozy Friday night 
because I hadn’t checked my Ital-
ian restaurant guide.

I’m back in Rome now, and yes, 

I cried the first day.But ever since 
last Saturday, I’ve chilled out a 
bit, because I had an eye-opening 
meal. When I say “eye-opening,” 
that probably conjures a young 
American who travels to Italy, 
nervously enters small eating 
establishment, tastes pasta, and 
murmurs “ah, I finally understand 
— THIS is what pasta is!” 

But the lunch I had at Eno-

teca Corsi on Friday, just a stone’s 
throw from the Pantheon, was 
eye-opening in a different way. 

I first ate at Corsi in the fall of 

2006, on the first day of a family 
vacation with my italophile par-
ents. I remember, in spite of an 
anesthetizing bout of jet-lag, what 
I ate: a soupy pasta with chickpeas 
and rosemary, sliced veal with 
roasted potatoes, a glass jug of vino 
rosso della casa. 

I came back to Corsi in the sum-

mer of 2013, when I was in Rome 
for a month to work on an archaeo-
logical dig. I had wandered, by 
myself, from the Palatine area, 
toward where I vaguely recalled 
Corsi being. I finally arrived after 
a circuitous hour, with that dis-
tinct tenderness in my feet from 
walking on Rome’s uneven cobble-
stones. It looked more or less how I 
remembered: scruffy dining room, 
several generations of one family 
staffing it, paper napkins. The only 
change being a slightly expanded 
menu now printed on floppy sheets 
of cheap paper instead of being 
written on a blackboard. I ate fet-
tuccine boscaiola, with tomatoes 
and mushrooms, and then roasted 
lamb, all of it lovingly prepared, 
simple, delicious. But my anxious 
expectations were deadening my 
palate a little. I had expected tran-
scendence, and only gotten excel-
lence. 

Fast-forward to last Saturday 

and here I was in Corsi again, 
with two new friends, eating 
pasta with chickpeas and veal 
with potatoes. The dining room 
hadn’t changed much. The menu 
still had adorable mistransla-
tions like “pasta with tomato and 
chilly.” The chef still emerged 
from the kitchen for a cigarette 
every now and then, his hair a 
little more salt than pepper since 
I last saw him.

I pondered each dish as it 

arrived. I hadn’t had chickpeas 
this plump, but didn’t one of my 
cookbooks say that a pasta dish 
be shouldn’t be this soupy? The 
potatoes were crisp on the out-
side, waxy-smooth on the inside, 
all cut different sizes — was that 
intentional? 

While I examined the viscos-

ity of my veals sauce, the regulars 
were arriving for lunch. Groups of 
elderly, elegant men and women 
hugged and kissed the owners 
before seating themselves and 
ordering liters of house wine and 
plates of roasted fish. Some read 
newspapers, others stabbed and 
slashed the air with passionate 
gesticulations. This meal was 
clearly a weekly, maybe even daily 
ritual. 

I looked down at my own food. 

The garlic cloves roasted with 
the potatoes were unpeeled. The 
veal had a bit of un-caramelized 
fat rimming the outside. Then I 
realized why I loved this place so 
much: It was normal. Not mind-
blowing, not avant-garde or cut-
ting edge or even world-class. 
Just normal, fun, comfortable 
and satisfying. 

There is a tendency amongst 

even those who haven’t been to 
Rome to assume that a trip to 
Rome will be a highlight reel of 
food porn. Most articles about 
Roman food usually sound like 
this: “When I bit into the brus-
chetta, and the blood-red toma-
toes burst and filled my mouth 
with their sweet nectar, I gazed 
with teary eyes towards Saint 
Peters and said a little prayer.” 

Rome is a city, populated by 

normal people with normal lives, 
who all have to eat. There’s good 
food and bad food, cheap food and 
expensive food, food for special 
occasions and food for the rest 
of the time. And if I had to eat in 
one place for the rest of my life, I 
might choose here. Not because of 
any rankings or guidebooks, but 
because I like eating pasta with 
chickpeas, and roast veal and 
potatoes, on Friday afternoons. 

The view of the Pantheon 

doesn’t hurt.

New musical ‘Boom!’
For God’s sake, just 

watch ‘The Fall’

GENDER AND MEDIA COLUMN

A 

police chief hiding 
behind a scruffy beard 
and meekly bloody 

nose asks, “Why are women 
emotionally 
and spiritu-
ally so much 
stronger than 
men?” This 
happens after 
he drunkenly 
forces him-
self into the 
bedroom of a 
former flame 
— blonde, 
enigmatic 
Stella Gibson — and ineptly 
tries to make a pass at her. 

Stella responds with char-

acteristic 
softness, 
“Because 

the basic human form is female. 
Maleness is a kind of birth 
defect.”

Mic dropped. Game changed. 

Feminist icon born. 

For a while it seemed as 

though my mom and I were the 
only people in the world who 
watched “The Fall.” I wrote 
about it in this publication — 
twice, actually — and talked 
about it to everyone, includ-
ing the deli counter person at 
Meijer and the entirety of my 
90-count Marketing lecture. 
So you could say I like “The 
Fall.” The smart and surpris-
ingly erotic BBC crime thriller 
expertly meandered through 
its first season, following “50 
Shades of Grey” star Jamie Dor-
nan’s 
disturbingly 
seductive 

serial killer and Gillian Ander-
son (TV’s “Hannibal”) as Stella, 
the coldly brilliant investigator 
out to find him. 

Season one, which appeared 

on Netflix in 2012, spends 
much of its five episodes quietly 
building a feminist argument 
that parallels the misogyny of 
its woman-killer lead. Season 
two, which came out on Netf-
lix last Friday, takes those ideas 
and amplifies them, explicitly 
attacking the violent patriar-
chal structures women face. 

Paul Spector preys on young 

professional 
women; 
inde-

pendent, unabashedly sexual, 
beautiful. While season one 
preoccupies itself with Paul’s 
actions — stalking, strangling, 
lovingly bathing the dead bod-
ies — season two develops 
the psyche behind his hatred 
towards women; the abandon-
ment via suicide of his mother, 
his conflicted love of his daugh-
ter and tenuous relationship 
with his wife, who is blonde and 
soft and nurturing (read: noth-
ing like his victims).

But ultimately, he just feels 

threatened by these women, as 
Stella shows us. In a memora-
ble moment in the first-season 
finale, Chief Burns calls Spec-
tor a monster, a murderer of the 
most debased degree, inhuman. 
Stella answers with a requisite 
lack of dramatics: “No, he is 
just a basic misogynist.” She is 
a breath of fresh air in a trend 
of bullshit feminism on televi-
sion — she doesn’t make care-
fully 
politicized 
statements 

or brand herself as a “strong” 
woman. Stella states the facts 
the way they are, outlining our 
sexist world without self-pity or 
apology. 

Season two begins with Stella 

interviewing Spector’s sole sur-
vivor, only recently awakened 
from an injury-induced coma. 
Many “strong female charac-
ters” on television struggle con-
necting to other women; strong 
is termed as standoffish and iso-
lated, a one-woman army. While 
Stella cannot be described as 
warm, this scene portrays her 
incredible depth for empathy, 
and her passionate, concen-
trated hatred towards men who 
perpetuate violence. Stella may 
be a slight misandrist, hating 
men and using them for sex, but 
she is not a robot, and her emo-
tions are deeply tied to her pre-
cise instincts.

While “The Fall” is still 

relatively unknown (its odd 
release schedule and slow burn 
structure don’t add up to a far-
reaching hit), Anderson has 

been making waves for her per-
formance as Stella, a character 
unlike any other on TV. (Not to 
say that Dornan isn’t revelatory 
as Spector; brooding, magnetic, 
conflictingly foxy. But his sexy 
serial killer schtick isn’t exact-
ly new, whereas Stella’s mix 
of frankness and adeptness is 
rare.) Anderson wrote a profile 
piece for Yahoo, in which she 
directly addresses the enigma 
of Stella: 

“Is it that Stella is at once in 

touch with her femininity in a 
way we have not seen, and yet 
still able to stand up for her-
self with strength, intelligence, 
grace and self-containment? … 
I’m not so sure, and yet none of 
the usual (independent, intel-
ligent, focused, serious, profes-
sional, strong and, yes, feminist) 
character descriptions seem to 
define or explain the whole of 
her.”

That’s the crux of it. I just 

spent 700 words trying to 
describe why I love Stella, and 
why we need Stella on television 
today. But like any real woman, 
she defies explanation, a mix 
of complexities, mysteries and 
idiosyncrasies.

Please, please, for the love of 

God, watch “The Fall,” if you 
don’t already. If well-devel-
oped and stylishly executed 
feminist manifestos aren’t your 
thing, watch for the terrify-
ing suspense. If you don’t like 
regular crime thrillers, watch 
for the fascinating dichotomy 
between killer and investigator, 
the blurred lines of right and 
wrong. And if none of that does 
it for you, there’s skewed power 
dynamics, 
salacious 
crimes 

and impeccable dialogue, even 
a pretty memorable make-out 
scene between Anderson and 
“The Good Wife” ’s Archie Pan-
jabi — you know, if that’s your 
thing.

Gadbois is re-watching that 

scene with Gillian Anderson 

and Archie Panjabi. To join,

EVENT PREVIEW

By CAROLYN DARR

Daily Arts Writer

The term “musical” is often 

associated with certain images, 
usually involving large casts, show-
stopping songs 
and 
elaborate 

dance 
num-

bers. However, 
Ann 
Arbor 

Civic 
The-

atre’s 
(A2CT) 

upcoming pro-
duction of the 
three-person 
musical “tick, 
tick … BOOM!” 
fights 
against 

these precon-
ceived notions.

“tick, tick … 

BOOM!” is an 
autobiographi-
cal musical written by Jonathan 
Larson, composer of the hit musi-
cal “RENT.” The show details 
the life of Jonathan, a struggling 
musical author nearing his 30th 
birthday, who is trying to juggle a 
girlfriend that wants to get mar-
ried and move to the suburbs and 
a best friend that wants him to give 
up on his dreams and come work 
for him at his big firm.

“Jonathan Larson wrote (this 

show) in response to getting 
another 
work 
rejected 
on 

Broadway,” said director Rachel 
Francisco, who is also the Manager 
of Marketing, Promotion & Special 
Events at the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance. “So it talks about 
him trying to come to grips with 
his choices in life. So it’s about him 
kind of wrestling with where he 
is.”

While Francisco has directed 

and performed in a number of 
A2CT’s shows in the past, “tick, tick 
… BOOM!” was a new experience 
for her, particularly when it came 
to directing such a small cast.

“When you work with only 

three people, you can immediately 
jump in and start some really heavy 
work on music and character and 
dialogue because you’re not trying 
to coordinate 20 people, which is 
sometimes hard to even get them 
all in the same room at the same 
time,” Francisco said. “So it’s 
created an incredibly intimate and 
tight cast.”

The show is not very well 

known, as it never opened officially 
on Broadway, instead premiering 
off-Broadway at the Jane Street 
Theater in 2001. Because it is so 
small, there aren’t a lot of past 
productions that directors can 
draw inspiration from. Francisco, 
however, was lucky enough to see 
the show when it opened and went 
into the production with a clear 
image.

“There’s only so much you can 

do with this particular show. It’s 
very clear on what it is and when it 
is,” Francisco said. “It’s also meant 
to be a small show so it doesn’t call 
for crazy sets or lots of costume 
changes, so it really has to be all 
about the characters.”

Despite being limited in set and 

costume choices, Francisco found 
a way to make the show more 
character-focused and unique.

“There 
was 
one 
song 
in 

particular that really didn’t seem 
to fit the show at all. It didn’t 
do anything for the plot, it was 
pretty misogynistic, it was just 
not working,” Francisco said. “So, 
instead, my music director wrote 
a new song to put in the show 
that actually takes the characters 
further along a path that is really 
only hinted at, but ends up giving 
the entire show much more depth.”

In the end, though, Francisco 

simply wants the audience to have 
a good time at the show. 

“I just hope they enjoy it because 

it’s a great production and we have 
really great performers in it,” she 
said. “But also, just a moment of 
thinking about choices we make 
in life and how sometimes, in the 
moment, you think you’ve made a 
mistake but maybe later on you’re 
able to look back and say ‘no those 
kind of choices helped create who I 
am today.’”

BOOM!’

Aussome ‘Babadook’ 

FILM REVIEW

By ANDREW MCCLURE

Daily Arts Writer

Horror 
movies 
are 
almost 

invariably funny. Until they’re 
not. There’s a good reason that, 
to 
cineastes 

and armchair 
moviegoers 
alike, Kubrick’s 
“The Shining” 
and Polanski’s 
“Rosemary’s 
Baby” 
have 

remained 
in 

the 
horror 

canon, 
the 

discourse — the millennial atten-

tion span — for this long. And that 
reason is the same reason why the 
tits-every-two-scenes 
“Hallow-

een” or “Nightmare on Elm Street” 
franchises loop without end on 
cable, as if shown by sheer con-
tractual obligation and not in any 
remote effort to, you know, scare. 
And the reason is this: Good hor-
ror movies make you look inward, 
in the mirror, wondering, “What if 
I, rather than some monster, could 
be breathing behind that chestnut 
door”? Rookie director Jennifer 
Kent splashes big and dark in her 
debut, “The Babadook,” which is 
not only among the best pictures 
of 2014, but one that’ll surely 
secure her seat at the not-big table 
of Aughtie indie filmmakers to 
watch.

By all accounts in the first half-

hour of this 90-minute horror 
pic, this is less a horror pic, more 
a drama bleeding into comedy. 
Kent is in no rush to force-feed 
us obvious narrative omens, ones 
that lead to death knells of char-
acters we (probably) couldn’t care 
less about. She stays local, opting 
for the brain-space of the mother 
Amelia (played sleeplessly by 
Essie Davis, TV’s “Miss Fisher’s 
Murder Mysteries”) whose sev-
en-year-old son Samuel (played 
with brilliance by newcomer 
Noah Wiseman) redefines what 
it means to “have it rough” as a 
widowed mother (the father died 
on the car ride to the ER, survived 
by the pregnant Amelia carrying 
their son). He acts out at school, 
has no friends, obsesses over DIY 
magic kits and, most importantly, 
drives his mother mad, whose 
blondish hair grows whiter, thin-
ner, her forehead more wrinkly — 
parenting taking its toll, and fast.

This well-directed dramedy 

then inhales darker fumes. One 
night while Samuel demands his 
mother read him to sleep, she 
grabs an unfamiliar, ancient-
looking red book titled “Mister 
Babadook.” The black-and-white 
words and illustrations quickly 
signify that Mom definitely made 
the wrong choice. Uttering the 
rhyming pages aloud, like, “You 
start to change when I get in / The 

Babadook growing under your 
skin … ,” Amelia has summoned 
something inhuman. What fol-
lows is sort of what you’d expect: 
Samuel claims to have had con-
versations with Mister B, bizarre 
noises at night, a knowing dog. 
But Kent only flirts with these 
tired exercises to unpack fur-
ther what becomes increasingly 
unclear: Does Amelia’s flagging 
disposition make her so less a 
credible, protagonistic character 
that we may have to entertain less 
linear alternatives?

The best monster movies have 

none. Jack Torrence in “The Shin-
ing” saw weird stuff, but his reli-
ability as our guide was always 
moot, his psyche unfamiliar with 
emotional equilibrium. The mon-
ster rested inside Torrence, hun-
gry to disrupt yet smart enough 
to be patient. Ultimately, this is 
what we find in Amelia, a woman 
whose eyes avert so incessantly to 
her wild child that she cannot see, 
or acknowledge as real, the terror 
before her, inside her.

Make no mistake, “The Baba-

dook” can be most easily shelved 
as a cheap, albeit clever allegory 
to motherhood. And your point? 
If anything, this speaks to the 
film’s gilded strength: its inher-
ent femaleness. Kent uses old 
tricks, yes, but eschews the shitty 
ones, like the vapid talking pair of 
breasts or the pitiable mother or 
the bitchy bitch. Her gender-neu-
tral, egalitarian approach works 
because nobody is your friend, 
everyone has demons and Mister 
Babadook is inarguably haunting 
with his cutlery fingers and black 
lips.

The finest scene happens when, 

after a couple failed attempts to 
destroy the book, it appears magi-
cally on the doorstep after a door-
bell ring. Amelia tentatively totes 
it onto her kitchen table, opening 
it with glacial care. The images 
shown within this revised edition 
of the book could be the scariest 
minute of filmmaking in recent 
memory. No editing gimmicks, no 
athletic lensing, just a book and 
nothing else. The film itself feels 
like this.

Shot put standout has unique path

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

Long before Derek Sievers 

was a shot put standout for the 
Michigan men’s track team, 
he hoped to make a name for 
himself on the gridiron.

He spent three years as 

a starting fullback on the 
football team at Byron Center 
(Michigan) High School.

He has won the shot put four 

times in his collegiate career, 
including 
victories 
at 
the 

Simmons-Harvey 
Invitational 

on Jan. 17 and against Michigan 
State on Jan. 24. He also finished 
15th at the 2013 NCAA Outdoor 
Championships 
and 
seventh 

at the 2014 Big Ten Outdoor 
Championships in the event.

“The shot put event happens 

so fast,” Sievers said. “You 
have to clear your mind and 
use the nervous energy to your 
advantage.”

While it sounds funny to call 

the shot put a fast-paced event, 
the rapid motions it requires are 
fitting for Sievers.

***

At Byron Center, Sievers 

amassed 2,212 yards on 340 
carries. 
During 
his 
junior 

year, he notched 769 yards on 
133 carries and nine rushing 
touchdowns 
despite 
sharing 

duties with another running 
back.

But 
Sievers 
truly 

demonstrated his prowess his 
senior year, when he collected 
1,157 yards on 147 carries, 
equating to 7.9 yards per carry. 
It was a performance that won 
him All-Area and All-State 
honors. Sievers even added 13 
rushing touchdowns for good 
measure while sharing the job 
yet again.

Yet even with his success as 

a running back, Sievers always 
considered himself first and 
foremost an offensive lineman, 
a position he had played since 
his pee-wee football years.

“If you run the ball, you get 

hit,” Sievers said. “If you’re 
blocking someone, you get to hit 
them.”

Perhaps it was a way of 

bonding with his father, who 
played football at Southeast 
Missouri State from 1982 to 
1986 as an offensive lineman. 

“My dad was my pee-wee 

coach all the way up through 
eighth grade,” Sievers said. 
“We’d always practice in the 
backyard and stuff. He instilled 
in me that you can either be the 
hammer or the nail, and you 
don’t want to be the nail.”

Or maybe it was a way of 

keeping up with his brother, 
who took delight in pushing 
him around. The sibling rivalry 
soon translated into skills as 
a linebacker. Sievers finished 
2009 with 79 tackles, three 
recovered fumbles and three 
catches for interceptions.

“It 
was 
pretty 
intense 

between my brother and me 
until I outgrew him in ninth 
grade,” Sievers said.

Sievers was also the punter 

for Byron Central for all three 
seasons of his career, averaging 

34.3 yards per punt in that 
stretch. He even dabbled in the 
long snapper position for a time 
as well.

As if all of that weren’t 

enough, Sievers took part in 
wrestling and bowling during 
the winter months.

“I was just trying to live my 

high-school 
sporting 
career 

out,” Sievers said. “I didn’t 
really focus on one thing. 
Bowling was awesome because 
I got free bowling all the time.”

***

But Sievers’ other sports did 

not detract from his track and 
field performance. In both his 
junior and senior seasons, he 
earned All-State honors in both 
the shot put and discus events 
and won the Division II state 
championship in the discus. 
It rubbed off on the rest of the 
team as Byron Central won the 
Division II team title in 2010 
and 2011. 

“Track was the best overall 

experience for me,” Sievers said. 
“That’s why I continue to do it 
today.”

Even with all of his success, 

he was largely overlooked on 
the recruiting trail for both 
football and track. But once 
Michigan called, there were no 
more decisions to make.

“No one really recruited me 

out of high school for track,” 
Sievers 
said. 
“And 
football 

was mostly Division II and 
Division III schools. Michigan 
came along at the very end of 
my senior season and my mom 
said, ‘If you can go to Michigan, 
you’re gonna go to Michigan.’ ”

Still, Sievers gets a kick out of 

football even though his playing 
days are done. He is a denizen of 
Michigan Stadium on football 
Saturdays and regards those 
days as some of his best in Ann 
Arbor.

While Sievers may be a shot 

put star, football will always be 
a part of him. 

‘M’ hopes growth 
process complete

By BRANDON CARNEY 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s lacrosse 

team is entering its fourth 
year of competition, and its 
players and coaches believe the 
program is finally ready to take 
the step out of infancy.

Following a five-win season 

in 2014, the Wolverines believe 
the worst of the team’s growing 
pains are behind them.

“This year, we have so many 

guys that are mature and used 
to the system,” said senior 
attacker Will Meter. “I think 
we’re looking to go full steam 
ahead and not worry about any 
growth. We’ve already gone 
through that.”

Top-scoring 
sophomore 

attacker 
Ian 
King 
returns 

for Michigan, and redshirt 
sophomore goalkeeper Gerald 
Logan is also back after missing 
last season with an injury. 
King, Logan and sophomore 
midfielder 
Mikie 
Schlosser 

were all named to the Big Ten 
Players to Watch list. The three 
will make up the core of the 
team, and Meter expects them 
all to improve.

“King 
and 
Logan 
have 

played at an extremely high 
level,” Meter said. “Even as 
solid as they’ve played in their 
first years, there’s always an 
opportunity to take a step 
forward, and these two can be 
elite players. We’re really going 
to need to rely on them.”

Michigan coach John Paul 

has brought in a highly rated 
13-man recruiting class, and he 
retains eight of his nine point-
getters from last year. While 
youth is still an issue with the 
Wolverines, the potential for 
the team is sky-high.

With the development of 

the 
program 
coming 
along 

nicely, Michigan will turn its 
attention to the development of 
its new league. The Wolverines 
will be a part of the inaugural 
Big Ten lacrosse season. New 
arrivals Maryland and Johns 

Hopkins are expected to rank 
atop the conference, as both are 
preseason top-10 teams.

Michigan was voted last in 

the Big Ten preseason poll, 
but that doesn’t mean the 
Wolverines won’t be looking 
to make some noise. With 
television 
appearances 
and 

national exposure coming with 
the new conference, the team 
is excited to show the country 
where the program is heading.

“We know the Big Ten’s 

going to be tough this first 
year,” Meter said. “Playing 
these bigger teams that have 
won national titles doesn’t 
seem as daunting of a task now. 
They’re just going to be regular 
games.”

If there’s one game Michigan 

has circled on its calendar, it’s 
the April 5 matchup against 
Ohio State. The Wolverines 
have yet to defeat the Buckeyes 
in three years of competition, 
something 
the 
senior 
class 

hopes to change in its final 
season.

“The 
seniors 
have 
had 

meetings about what we want 
our legacy to be, and we really 
want to be the first team to 
beat Ohio State,” said senior 
defender Mack Gembis. “That 
would be the culmination of all 
the work we put in the past four 
years.”

Whether or not Michigan can 

defeat Ohio State this season, 
the seniors are a historic group 
for the program. The class will 
be the first that has played 
all four years, something the 
seniors know is special.

“It wasn’t always easy at 

times,” Meter said. “But we 
went through a lot, and that’s 
why I think this season’s the 
biggest. If we can come out, do 
well in the Big Ten and prove 
ourselves, it’ll show how far 
we’ve come as a class in leading 
this team.”

Seniors like Meter helped the 

program take its first step. Now 
they’re helping it take its first 
running strides.

MEN’S LACROSSE

The last moose standing: Max Bielfeldt

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Max Bielfeldt’s lower legs are 

legendary. But lately, the large-
calved forward is seeing less 
about them on Twitter, and he 
thinks that’s a good thing.

“I was making a joke the other 

day,” he said. “It’s a good sign 
that I’m playing better when 
after a game, back in the day, 
80 percent of the Tweets were 
about my calves and now only 20 
percent are about my calves. So 
I think that means I’m playing a 
little better.”

Known as “Moose” to his 

coaches and teammates, the 
6-foot-7 senior is enjoying a 
late-career surge. Bielfeldt is 
averaging just shy of 10 points 
and 21 minutes per game over 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s 
last 
three 
Big 
Ten 

contests, on the heels of three 
seasons in which he barely saw 
the floor.

He’s now known as a key 

contributor on a Wolverine 
squad that, as of late, has 
impressed with its resiliency 
in the face of injury and 
inexperience.

Following Mitch McGary’s 

departure for the NBA, Jordan 
Morgan’s graduation and Jon 
Horford’s 
transfer, 
Bielfeldt 

found himself the Wolverines’ 
lone upperclassman big man 
in 2014-15. With each passing 
game, it becomes increasingly 
clear 
he 
isn’t 
taking 
the 

responsibility lightly.

Rather, 
Bielfeldt 
has 

taken advantage of the role, 
climbing the depth chart to 
become — depending on the 
situation — Michigan’s first 
big off the bench. Despite their 
inexperience, it was freshman 
Ricky 
Doyle 
and 
redshirt 

freshman Mark Donnal who 
engaged in a preseason battle 
to start at the ‘5’ spot, with 

Bielfeldt viewed as the third 
horse in a two-lane race.

But that didn’t stop him from 

helping 
contain 
Wisconsin’s 

Frank 
Kaminsky 
and 
his 

five-inch height advantage in 
Michigan’s 65-60 overtime loss 
to the Badgers on Jan. 24, or 
shooting 6-for-9 from the field 
to help the Wolverines take 
down Nebraska on Tuesday.

It helps, of course, that 

Bielfeldt spends the days leading 
up to games impersonating the 
very players he’s later assigned 
to defend. He leads Michigan’s 
scout team, a role Michigan 
coach John Beilein says he 
assigned him “because he’s the 
brightest of all those guys at 
knowing college basketball.”

“On the scout team, you kind 

of see what (your opponents’) 
go-to moves are,” Bielfeldt said. 
“It expands your game a little bit. 
If they have a good turnaround 
jumper or something, and you 
try to emulate that in practice 
and it goes down for you, you 
might try to incorporate that 
yourself.”

While being assigned to the 

scout 
team 

is 
sometimes 

viewed 
as 

a 
sign 
that 

a 
player 

shouldn’t 
expect 
to 

contribute 
in 
game 

situations, 
it’s much the 
opposite 
this 

year for Bielfeldt.

“He’s on that scout team 

because that’s what the team 
needs him to do,” Beilein said.

Bielfeldt has been one of 

the 
scout 
team’s 
de 
facto 

captains throughout much of 
his career. But with LeVert 
out, he and junior guard Spike 
Albrecht are the only remaining 
upperclassmen on Michigan’s 

active roster, creating shortages 
on the experience and leadership 
fronts.

“Three was already a small 

number,” 
Bielfeldt 
said 
of 
the 

dwindling 
number 
of 

veterans. 
“Two is even 
less.”

The 
sheer 

numbers pose 
an issue when 
it 
comes 
to 

simply leading by example. 
With half a roster’s worth of 
upperclassmen, it’s easy for 
experienced players to set the 
on-court tone. In this particular 
circumstance, Bielfeldt says the 
instruction has to be a bit more 
explicit.

“You just have to talk to the 

guys more,” Bielfeldt said. “Back 
in high school, they might not 

have realized that you kind of 
need to jog the drill, keep the 
energy of practice up.

“When you only have two 

guys who have been here for 
more than a year, you have to say 
it more than do it … you have to 
instill it in them.”

Bielfeldt’s 
senior 
status 

in 2014-15 wasn’t always the 
plan. Though he has a year of 
eligibility remaining, Beilein 
and his staff decided in Summer 
2014 that Bielfeldt would be 
listed as a senior this year.

The decision made sense 

for both parties; it opened up 
a scholarship for Michigan’s 
next freshman class, and it 
allowed Bielfeldt — who had just 
38 career points prior to this 
season — to transfer for a final 
season elsewhere, should he 
choose to.

Bielfeldt took the news in 

stride, working to establish 
himself as a leader and taking 

advantage of his newfound 
health. 
He 
underwent 
hip 

surgery toward the end of Spring 
2014, sidelining him for nearly 
the entire summer but relieving 
him of a major inhibitor to his 
play.

“Basketball’s a lot more fun 

when you land and it doesn’t 
hurt,” Bielfeldt said. “I’m having 
more fun and playing more, and 
with the hip surgery I’m just 
feeling better, so you know, just 
general cuts and jumps and all 
that.”

While he’s certainly having 

more fun playing, Bielfeldt is 
also flourishing in his roles as a 
mentor and tutor for his younger 
teammates. From a mentorship 
perspective, 
the 
Wolverines 

timed 
their 
international 

summer trip well (the program 
is allowed to take one every four 
years).

Michigan spent 10 days in 

Italy in the offseason, giving 

Bielfeldt a chance to get to 
know a class of freshmen that, 
mid-summer, would typically 
be busy throughout the day 
with practice, summer classes, 
tutoring and other introduction-
to-college activities.

“It 
was 
nothing 
crazy,” 

Bielfeldt 
told 
the 
Daily 
in 

Novemeber. 
“I’d 
go 
walk 

around with (freshman guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur- 

Rahkman) or somebody, learn 
more about him, and I think 
overall we’re closer in that.”

It was the details, Bielfeldt 

said, 
that 
made 
the 
trip 

particularly meaningful.

“Little things, like me and 

Muhammad walking into some 
little shop and looking at some 
European soccer jersey,” he 
said. “I never would’ve done 
that in the past three years with 
an older player.”

While 
it’s 
not 
a 
yearly 

occurrence for a player who 
spent his first three years largely 
on the bench to emerge as a 
leader and major contributor in 
his senior season, Beilein says 
it’s nothing new.

“I’ve seen it before,” Beilein 

said, 
“where 
guys 
in 
that 

senior year all of a sudden are 
so valuable to you, because 
they’ve got the experience, 
that maturity about them, that 
they’ve been there and done that 
before.

“They’ve been waiting a long 

time for that opportunity, so 
that’s been huge.”

Bielfeldt, regardless of how 

he got there, is happy to finally 
be playing major minutes and 
contributing as much as he has 
been lately.

“Overall, you just have to be 

ready,” Bielfeldt said. “Next man 
up.”

Tough task ahead for ‘M’ 
against defending champs

By LELAND MITCHINSON

For the Daily

The No. 16 Michigan wrestling 

team will have a difficult time 
Friday night when it hosts No. 
5 Penn State 
at Cliff Keen 
Arena. 
The 

Wolverines are 
attempting 
to 

harness 
the 

momentum 
of 
back-to-

back Big Ten 
wins 
against 

Wisconsin and 
Indiana, while 
Penn 
State 

looks to bounce 
back from a tough one-point loss 
to No. 2 Minnesota Sunday.

The Wolverines are looking to 

come out and match the intensity 

of 
the 
four-time 
defending 

national 
champion 
Nittany 

Lions, who want to get back to 
their winning ways after last 
week’s loss.

“Penn State’s not gonna roll 

over for anybody.” said Michigan 
coach 
Joe 
McFarland. 
“You 

know they’re gonna be looking 
to rebound, they’re probably 
not happy about getting beat 
in a close one by Minnesota, so 
they’re gonna come in here and 
try to take it out on us. And our 
job is to squish that right away, 
win some of these early matches, 
get that momentum on our side 
and build off that.”

McFarland realizes that many 

of the wrestlers he’s relying on 
to get that momentum are also 
some of the younger wrestlers on 
the team.

“If you look at our core, 

most guys out of our 10 were 
underclassmen,” he said. “We’ve 
got a lot of underclassmen and 
it’s great to see. Those guys are 
getting great experience and 
getting out there and laying it on 
the line.”

One of those underclassmen 

is sophomore Brian Murphy, 
currently 
the 
13th-ranked 

wrestler in the nation at the 157-
pound weight class.

Murphy has strung together 

some impressive wins in Big 
Ten dual meets including a win 
over Ohio State’s Josh Demas, 
currently ranked ninth in the 
country. Murphy, however, likes 
to approach things one match at 
a time.

“You know, I just try to act 

the same with every match,” he 
said. “You know (Demas) was 
a pretty good kid, but I tried to 
wrestle the same against him as 
I do against everyone else, and I 
just try to really focus on what I 
need to do.”

Another young contributor for 

the Wolverines is freshman Alec 
Pantaleo, currently the nation’s 
ninth-ranked wrestler in the 149-
pound weight class. Neither he 
nor Murphy buys into the team’s 
underdog status against Penn 
State.

Pantaleo knows Penn State has 

been good in the past, and still is, 
but he believes Michigan has the 
talent and work ethic to take the 
momentum of the two previous 
Big Ten wins and be successful 
Friday.

No matter what Pantaleo 

thinks, the match will be tough. 
Penn State has top wrestlers 
in the 125, 133, 157, 174, 197 
and heavyweight classes, and 
Michigan can be sure Nittany 
Lions coach Cael Sanderson will 
have his team prepared after last 
week’s close loss.

If Pantaleo, Murphy and the 

rest of the Wolverines take their 
momentum and swing some of 
the individual matches, the team 
can do exactly what the Golden 
Gophers did last week: beat the 
reigning champs.

WRESTLING
Offense faces another test

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

Riding a seven-game win 

streak and scoring more goals 
per game than any team in the 
country has since 2004, the 
No. 13 Michigan hockey team 
will 
be 
the 

clear favorite 
in 
Friday’s 

matchup 
against 
Michigan 
State 
at 
Joe 

Louis Arena in 
Detroit.

But 
with 

rivalry 
bragging 
rights 
and 

conference 
positioning on 
the line, plus 
potentially 
more 
than 
20,000 
fans 

watching, the Spartans have 
one player who may be able to 
slow the Wolverines’ roll and 
allow Michigan State to come 
away with an upset win: Jake 
Hildebrand.

The 
junior 
netminder 
— 

who’s also the last goalie to 
hold the Wolverines to less 
than four goals — has a .924 
save percentage and a 2.40 
goals-against average in his 
career, and currently leads the 
Big Ten in minutes, saves, save 
percentage and goals-against 
average. And if last week was 
any indication, he’s only now 
hitting his stride.

Hildebrand stopped 55 of 

56 shots in a weekend sweep 
of Ohio State, earning him Big 
Ten First Star of the Week 
accolades. If he’s at his best, the 
Spartans have a fighting chance 
at slowing an offense that is 
averaging 4.36 goals per game.

“He’s a competitor, that’s 

what 
separates 
him,” 
said 

Michigan State coach 
Tom 

Anastos. “He goes out and 
competes 
consistently, 
and 

we’re reliant on him at times 
because of how consistent he 
is.”

Despite 
Hildebrand’s 
hot 

streak, 
Michigan 
(7-1 
Big 

Ten, 15-7 overall) heads into 
the matchup unfazed. That’s 

because it has made even the 
best netminders look foolish in 
recent weeks.

Whether it was eight goals in 

a game against 2013 New York 
Islanders draft pick and Penn 
State starter Eamon McAdam, 
13 goals in a weekend sweep 
of Wisconsin’s former NCAA 
top-10 goaltender Joel Rumpel, 
18 goals in two games against 
a pair of veteran Ohio State 
goaltenders or even 11 goals in 
two games over reigning Big Ten 
Player of the Year Adam Wilcox 
of Minnesota, the Wolverines 
know that, if given the chance, 
they’ll find the points.

“It’s pretty hard to prepare 

for a goalie,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “If we 
knew 
his 
weaknesses, 
he 

wouldn’t be so good and we’d 
have no problem. We prepare 
for their style of play, or some 
of their tendencies or their 
strengths or weaknesses.

“I think our team knows that 

if push comes to shove, if we can 
get a couple scoring chances, 
we’ll find a way to score.”

Though 
Hildebrand 
will 

prove to be Michigan’s toughest 
challenge since its 2-5 start 
to the season, the Spartans 
(3-3-2, 9-11-2) have had fits of 

inconsistency on both sides of 
the puck. Anastos knows that 
for his team to walk away with a 
win, he’s going to need a strong 
performance by his entire team, 
and maybe a little rivalry magic 
in the neutral-site game.

“They’re a different team 

than they were the last time 
we 
played 
them,” 
Anastos 

said. 
“They’re 
doing 
some 

incredible 
things, 
especially 

on the offensive side of the 
puck. They’re not just a one or 
two-line team that has holes or 
breaks, they can roll out any line 
and be a threat.”

The two teams have a rivalry 

dating back over 90 years, and 
they know that an added level of 
intensity is in the air when they 
face each other that can provide 
an x-factor in a tight game.

“It’s bigger than any of us,” 

Berenson said of the rivalry. 
“It was here before I came here 
as a player, and I didn’t fully 
understand it at first. I had no 
idea coming in, then I realized, 
‘Holy Jesus, this is a war when 
we played those guys.’

“It’s 
a 
rivalry 
that 
has 

endured, and we know there’s 
a lot of people watching this 
game, so we need to make sure 
we’re ready.”

Terps too much for ‘M’

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Writer

After allowing No. 5 Maryland 

to jump out to an 11-0 lead in the 
first two minutes of the game, the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team needed major heroics to 
overcome the deficit if it had any 
chance of coming out victorious 
over 
the 
only 

undefeated 
team left in 
the Big Ten.

Seeing that her team needed 

help, Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico let Katelynn Flaherty check 
into the game a few minutes 
earlier than usual. Though the 
freshman guard didn’t make the 
immediate impact Barnes Arico 
was looking for, Michigan was 
still able to play catch-up.

Back-to-back 3-pointers from 

the hands of sophomore guard 
Siera 
Thompson 
and 
junior 

guard Madison Ristovski cut the 
Maryland lead to 17-16. Michigan 
had early hope, but ultimately 
was too overwhelmed by the 
Terrapins’ offense and was unable 
to fight back against a team 
shooting over 50 percent. Five 
Wolverines committed at least 
three fouls in the 91-65 Michigan 
loss.

“I think they were just a lot 

more physical than us,” said 
senior forward Nicole Elmblad. 
“They were more willing to go 
in and mix it up and grab those 
rebounds and those loose balls. 
They were definitely a big team, 
they’ve got a couple of really big 
posts down there, and so they 
just did a really good job of going 
for the rebounds, and especially 
on the defensive end, they did a 
really good job of boxing Cyesha 
(Goree) and myself out.”

Goree played an important 

early role as well, scoring 10 
points in the first half to cut the 
lead, and unsurprisingly, scoring 
the first points of the game for 
the Wolverines (5-4 Big Ten, 13-7 
overall).

But 
Maryland’s 
struggles 

were just a hiccup — Michigan 
continually 
made 
elementary 

mistakes 
and 
the 
Terrapins 

were able to capitalize on the 
Wolverines’ errors.

Three 
Wolverine 
traveling 

calls in the first half helped 
Maryland 
reemerge 
again. 

Coupled with 12 points scored off 
Michigan turnovers in the first 
frame, the Terrapins (9-0, 18-2) 
entered halftime leading the 
Wolverines, 48-36.

“They did a really good job of 

driving to the basket and drawing 
fouls on us, which kind of took us 
out of our game,” Elmblad said. 
“We were worried about drawing 
fouls, so they were able to get 
some easy ones down low.”

Though the Wolverines trailed 

the Terrapins by around 15 points 
for most of the second frame, 
Michigan still had life — most 
notably when Flaherty made a 
jumper, stole the ball and then hit 
a follow-up trey to cut the lead to 
57-48.

Elmblad 
grabbed 
nine 

rebounds to combat Maryland’s 
prowess on the glass, but it 

wasn’t enough to challenge a 
team coming off of a Final Four 
appearance in 2014.

“I thought (Elmblad) played 

tough,” Barnes Arico said. “She 
had a tough matchup. She had a 
6-foot-3 kid to defend the whole 
time, and she’s coming off a game 
where she had 12 rebounds. … 
Her experience showed.”

Goree grabbed just four boards 

— a season low. The Wolverines 
were outrebounded, 49-25.

On 
top 
of 
outrebounding 

Michigan, the Terrapins showed 
why they are fourth-ranked 
team in the country in field-
goal percentage. Guards Laurin 
Mincy 
and 
Shatori 
Walker-

Kimbrough dropped 24 and 20 
points, respectively.

“They were really physical,” 

Goree said. “Even though they 
had great rebounders, we had to 
find a way.”

After a quiet first half, Flaherty 

and senior guard Shannon Smith 
came back stronger in the second 
half, scoring nine and seven, 
respectively, but it wasn’t enough 
to make any real dent into the 
deficit.

Inability to find rhythm on 
offense dooms Wolverines

By MINH DOAN 

Daily Sports Writer

As the Michigan Pep Band 

counted down the seconds on 
the shot clock, Maryland center 
Malina Howard received the ball 
at the right elbow. As the band 
counted down to one, Howard 
put up the shot.

In reality, the shot clock 

wasn’t winding down, there 
were still 13 seconds left, but it 
didn’t matter. Whether Howard 
fell for the band’s trick or not, 
she sank the mid-range jumper 
giving the Terrapins a 16-point 
lead with 11:15 left in the second 
half.

That was the key Thursday 

night 
at 
Crisler 
Center 
in 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team’s 91-65 loss to Maryland. 
The Terrapins were able to 
make critical shots, while the 
Wolverines (5-4 Big Ten, 13-7 
overall) were unable to find any 
rhythm on the offensive front.

Maryland’s shooting prowess 

was on display in the first half 
when there were spurts — it 
seemed 
like 
the 
Terrapins 

(9-0, 18-2) couldn’t miss a shot, 
no matter the type of defense 
Michigan played. There was 
a point in the first half when 
Maryland was shooting almost 
70 percent from the field.

“We tried man, we tried zone, 

we played a number of different 
things,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “But when 
you play a top-five team in the 
country, they have kids who can 
make shots.”

Added senior forward Cyesha 

Goree: “We looked to press them, 
because no one really presses 
them. When we tried to press 
them full court, once they beat 
it, they were able to get layups 
which is a reason why their 
percentage was so high.”

And when Maryland wasn’t 

making shots, it was winning 
the battle on the offensive glass, 
where it grabbed 17 offensive 
rebounds to Michigan’s nine, in 

addition to scoring 19 second-
chance points. The Terrapins’ 
point total of 91 was their fourth-
highest scoring output of the 
season.

Maryland’s tenacity also got 

Michigan into foul trouble, as 
Elmblad, Goree and freshman 
guard 
Katelynn 
Flaherty 

all finished with four fouls, 
while sophomore guard Siera 
Thompson and senior guard 
Shannon Smith finished with 
three each.

“They were on the attack 

mode, really trying to be super 
aggressive, 
really 
trying 
to 

attack us and draw fouls,” Goree 
said. “They did a really good job 
of that.”

On the other side of the court, 

the Wolverines were unable to 
find any sort of rhythm. That was 
especially the case for Flaherty, 
who scored just seven points, 
well below her average of 14.9 
points.

“I think the biggest challenge 

for her is getting adjusted to 
the length of some of the more 
athletic teams,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Their guards tonight were 
(5-foot-9, 5-foot-11 and 6 feet), 
and when she has had to play 
against really long guards, it has 
been a challenge for her.”

Goree, who has averaged 20.5 

points in her last five games, 
also did not have her best game, 
putting up just 14 points.

“They started crowding the 

paint more, at times I felt like I 
was one-on-one as I was doing 
my move, but then I got doubled,” 
Goree said. “By then, it was too 
late to kick it out.”

In just three days, Michigan 

will travel to Lincoln to take 
on No. 15 Nebraska — another 
team with an efficient shooter 
in guard Rachel Theriot — for its 
third game in seven days.

And 
for 
the 
Wolverines, 

they’re just going to have make 
some shots.

Kim Barnes Arico’s team had its share of struggles in a blowout loss to Maryland. The Wolverines were outrebounded, 49-25, in the defeat.
