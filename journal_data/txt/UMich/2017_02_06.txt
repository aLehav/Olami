An 
LSA 
freshman 
who 

requested to remain anonymous 
was held up when walking back to 
South Quad Residence Hall from 
a fraternity party Friday night 
— he could have called an Uber, 
but instead, he decided to set out 
on foot. During the walk back, a 
car pulled up next to him and an 
occupant of the car demanded his 
property. 

This incident has occurred 

amidst 
a 
series 
of 
similar 

robberies near campus in the 
past few weeks, something the 
University of Michigan Division 
of Public Safety and Security and 
the Ann Arbor Police Department 

said they are still trying to combat. 

“(I was) on East (University) 

and a car pulled up,” the victim 
said. “I didn’t think anything of it 
just because I thought it was like a 
normal car parking and then a guy 
jumped out. He had a longer gun, 
like possibly a shotgun kind of 
thing. He was like, ‘Hold up. Don’t 
say anything.’ ”

The robber, wearing a red 

bandana, proceeded to take the 
victim’s wallet and cell phone, and 
then drove off in his what a police 
report would later describe as a 
gray, four-door car. The victim 
walked back to South Quad, 
borrowed his roommate’s phone 
and called the police.

This is one of four robberies 

in downtown Ann Arbor in the 

As 
part 
of 
a 
national 

movement to preserve various 
data sets stored on government 
websites, University of Michigan 
students, faculty and Ann Arbor 
community members have begun 
working together to prevent the 
loss of important data.

Information graduate student 

Noa Kasman, a member of the 
University’s Society of American 
Archivists 
Student 
Chapter, 

helped 
coordinate 
a 
data-

archiving event held by University 
libraries last weekend, in which 
300 attendees gathered at the 
Undergraduate Library with the 
same goal — to ensure data is not 
lost amidst the efforts of President 
Donald Trump. She said the 
preservation efforts originally 
stemmed 
from 
the 
Internet 

Archive’s End of Term harvest, 
which started in 2008 in an effort 
to protect data on government 
websites that tend to be either 
removed or overlooked during 
transitions between presidential 
administrations.

“There’s 
an 
understanding 

that when there are presidential 
transitions, websites will change, 
and data that’s available online, 
especially 
from 
government 

agencies, is quite vulnerable,” she 
said.

Justin Schell, director of the 

Shapiro Design Lab, said the 
current political climate lends a 
sense of urgency to these archival 
efforts, referencing changes the 

Trump 
administration 
have 

instituted such as the amount of 
information on climate change 
on the Environmental Protection 
Agency website.

“We’re 
seeing 
webpages 

change, we’re seeing different 
kinds of data under threat,” he 
said. “The geospatial databases 
related to the racial disparity in 
housing is one thing that people 
are talking about. We’ve had 
contacts inside the EPA who 

have told us about particular data 
sets that they’ve heard could go 
down. So we quickly try to back 
those up and preserve those, so 
it is this moment where we have 
a particular thing to work on and 
not just the general ‘we’re trying 
to fix government data.’ ”

He 
said 
the 
archiving 

efforts 
during 
their 
event 

focused mainly on information 
from 
National 
Oceanic 

Atmospheric 
Administration, 

the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration and the 
Department of Energy.

The 
Educational 
Data 

Governance Initiative and the 
Data Refuge are two groups 
that 
help 
coordinate 
the 

national events and guided the 
areas of focus for the event to 
minimize overlap with efforts 
of other universities. Schell said 
collaboration both with other 

DETROIT — The Democratic 

National 
Committee 
held 

its third “Future Forum” at 
Wayne State University to 
introduce 
local 
Democrats 

to 
the 
candidates 
running 

for leadership offices at the 
national level.

The 
event 
opened 
with 

remarks from Democrats such 
as Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–
Mich.) and Detroit Mayor Mike 
Duggan. The morning session 
was 
devoted 
to 
discussing 

issues considered relevant in 
Michigan, which would prove 
to be hot topics as the day 
progressed.

Speeches echoed themes of 

party unity, demand for labor, 
the importance of the younger 
generation and voter rights. 
Chuck Jones, the president of 
the United Steelworkers Local 
1999, spoke about the demand 
for work.

CAMPUS EVENTS & NOTES

At noon on 

Saturday, teams of 

culinary students from 

southeastern Michigan 

participated in an 

ice-carving festival at 

County Farm Park with 

a student from Henry 

Ford College coming in 

first place. Some of the 

designs submitted in the 

contest were of birds, 

elephants and a fish 

wearing fishnet leggings. 

The event, now in 

its second year, was 

hosted by the Washtenaw 

County Parks and 

Recreation Commission 

as part of its Winter Fun 

Fest, which will continue 

until Feb. 18. Attendees 

drank hot chocolate 

and young children 

participated in arts and 

crafts activities.

According to MLive, 

the event was organized 

as a competition, whereas 

last year, it was only an 

art show. Students from 

Henry Ford College came 

in first and third place, 

while a student from 

Oakland Community 

College came in second.

Other events and 

programs scheduled for 

the Winter Fun Fest are 

family-oriented. They 

include a talk on how to 

identify animal tracks 

in the snow, a hike — or 

short walk — for toddlers 

and their parents, a 

day of ice-fishing and a 

daddy-daughter dance.

Competition bridging sciences, 
arts reveals winners over weekend

Record number of submissions for collaborative exhibit awards LSA, Art students

This past Friday afternoon, 

the Science as Arts competition 
exhibition and awards ceremony 
took place in the Hatcher Graduate 
Library for the fourth consecutive 
year to celebrate the collaboration 
between art and science. The 
Science 
Learning 
Center, 

ArtsEngine and Arts at Michigan 
sponsored the competition and 
celebrated a record number of 45 
entries this year. 

All 
current 
undergraduate 

students of the University of 
Michigan could participate in 
the competition, as long as their 
artwork represented a scientific 
concept or theme. Submissions 
were possible in all existing art 
categories and this year included 

prints, 
drawings, 
paintings, 

sculptures, 
poems 
and 
short 

essays, as well as time-based 
art such as videos and music 
performances.

Deb Mexicotte, the associate 

director of ArtsEngine and one of 
the collaborators and judges of the 
competition, explained all visitors 
of the exhibition could vote for 
their favorite piece of art through 
the “People’s Choice Award.”

“It allows to be really 

interactive with the crowd 
that has come out to see the 
exhibition,” Mexicotte said, 
explaining the award did not 
meet the same strict criteria 
the judges had to follow.

The 
winners 
of 
the 

competition were determined 
by six judges, who assessed 
the entries based on four 
criteria: 
scientific 
basis, 

aesthetic appeal, quality of 
explanation and quality of 
artistic explanation. They 
determined 
one 
grand 

winner for “Best Overall,” 
who received a $300 prize 
and winners for a number 
of categories, who received 
$150 each.

LSA 
sophomore 
Jesse 

Adler was the winner of both 
the “Best Overall” award and 
the “People’s Choice Award.” 
Her 
winning 
sculpture 

“Designer Drugs” blended 
chemistry and fashion. The 
sculpture was a pair of shoes 
that she modified by building 
models for two different 
molecules. The left shoe 
represents the molecule for 
meth and the right shoe the 
molecule for an ingredient 
in an over-the-counter nasal 
decongestant.

“I have always loved art 

and fashion, but I also have 
a big passion for science and 
chemistry,” Adler, who is 
majoring in neuroscience, 
said.

of coming together during a 
difficult time and fostering 
a safe space for the speakers. 
Al-Bonijim 
discussed 
the 

controversy surrounding the 
hijab in wake of the election 
and said she hopes the event 
will eradicate some of the 
misconceptions of the hijab.

“We came up with the name 

‘halfway hijabi’ because we feel 
being Muslim in America often 
feels like we have a sly identity,” 
she 
said. 
“With 
increasing 

xenophobia and Islamophobia, 
hijabi women have become the 
battleground for Islam-based 
politics because we are easily 
identified as Muslim. We are 
here to claim our voices and our 
space in the discussion of the 
hijab.”

Speakers of a variety of 

backgrounds, 
nationalities 

and 
identities 
shared 
their 

relationship with the hijab. 
Haidar said she wanted the 
audience to understand that 
what a hijab may mean to one 
woman may mean something 
completely different to another.

“There is no one image of 

a hijab that anyone can fully 
represent,” she said.

Muslim women have been 

at the center of post-election 
tension. 
In 
December, 
the 

Ann Arbor Police Department 
issued a report of a female 
student forced to remove her 
hijab, provoking large student 
protests — though AAPD later 
determined the incident did 
not occur. A similar crime alert 
labeled as “ethnic intimidation” 
a few days later — in addition to 
a spike in hate crimes around 
the country — fed a series of 
protests and vigils after the 
election.

LSA junior Noor Sulieman, 

a 
Syrian-American 
hijabi 

Muslim, began the night with 
her journey with the hijab 
as one of personal rebellion 
against society.

“Nothing in me, not my 

religion, 
my 
hijab 
or 
my 

heritage makes me any less 
American,” 
Sulieman 
said. 

“I would only argue it makes 
me more American. The type 
of American that works hard 
every day to push this country 
toward the path of social justice 
and equality for all.”

LSA 
freshman 
Maria 

Tout, 
a 
Lebanese-American 

immigrant, spent her childhood 
in Ypsilanti. On a visit to 
Lebanon at age 10, Tout admired 
the hijabi women around her 
and made the personal choice 
to wear the hijab, a decision she 

has stood by ever since.

“I didn’t have to,” she said. 

“Nobody wanted me to. It was 
only me.”

Being the only hijabi in many 

of her classes at the University 
can be difficult, Tout admitted, 
especially 
when 
her 
peers 

expect her to have a reaction to 
politics.

“Everyone would be like, ‘It’s 

Maria, let’s ask her how she 
feels,’ ” she said. “I didn’t want 
to talk to anybody. The caring 
and support seemed unreal.”

Ross 
sophomore 
Mariam 

Doudi, 
a 
first-generation 

Sudanese-American 
from 

Dearborn, said growing up 
as a Black-Arab Muslim, she 
struggled to fit in with either 
Black or Arab communities.

“My 
whole 
life 
I 
have 

been defined by my physical 
attributes, contributing to a 
lifetime of insecurity in terms 
of not belonging,” Doudi said. 
“On top of all my struggles that 
I have as a Black Arab, comes 
the fact that I am a hijabi. I am 
fighting two battles.”

Doudi said President Donald 

Trump’s recent immigration 
ban on seven Muslim-majority 
countries 
made 
her 
feel 

personally attacked.

“I was shocked to see that 

Sudan was on the list because 
we are not a country where 

terrorists come from,” Doudi 
said. “We are one of the most 
generous and hospitable people 
that I have ever met.”

Midway 
through 
the 

event, two performers led a 
rendition of Leonard Cohen’s 
“Hallelujah,” 
eliciting 
a 

standing 
ovation 
from 
the 

audience. The second portion of 
the night featured an open mike 
session.

Alum 
Sarah 
Khan’s 

monologue centered around 
a disclosure of her depression 
and anxiety in what she said 
was the first time she spoke in 
public about her struggle with 
mental health. Khan said she 
used to fear discussing mental 
health in her community.

“Having depression means 

sometimes hating my religion 
because my religion hasn’t 
fixed me and sometimes hating 
my religion because I can’t 
hide it,” Khan said. “I can’t 
hide my scarf, something that 
feels like a second skin to me. 
I have been harassed so many 
times for it.”

Khan said being a member 

of 
the 
Muslim 
community 

while having depression can be 
burdensome.

“Here I am, a brown Muslim 

woman trying to figure out how 
to survive in a world not built 
for my existence and trying 

to fix myself piece by piece,” 
Khan said. “I am so burdened 
with 
the 
responsibility 
of 

speaking for Muslims that I 
can barely focus on my own 
spirituality.”

In 
Canton 
high-schooler 

Khadega Mohammed’s spoken-
word piece titled “Once Upon 
a Time,” Mohammed told of 
a time in the United States, 
before Sept. 11, when Muslims 
were not seen as terrorists, 
she did not have to endure 
random screening checks at 
airports, did not fear attacks 
upon entering her mosque and 
her mother did not fear for her 
safety every day.

“Your 9/11 is our 24/7,” she 

said. “America would not be 
America without me, without 
Muslims, Blacks and Hispanics 
and minorities. Once upon a 
time, we were not a threat to 
your Americanism. Once upon 
a time people chose love over 
hate.”

Being 
a 
Black 
Muslim 

woman is tiring, Mohammed 
emphasized, in her second 
piece titled “Breathe.”

“I wish my skin color didn’t 

define whether I’m a Trayvon 
or a Zimmerman,” she said. 
“I wish the scarf on my head 
didn’t stereotype if I’m a 
devout Christian or a Taliban.”

LSA juniors Angela Hong 

and Komel Khan attended the 
event to gain awareness about 
the meaning of hijab, and to 
hear the stories of University 
students striving for social 
change through their activism.

Hong 
said 
she 
was 

appreciative that the event 
coordinators 
were 
able 
to 

find speakers of all different 
identities.

“I felt like all of us could 

identify at least some part of 
ourselves in the speakers,” 
Hong said. “It’s really difficult 
to become open and to talk 
about life experiences in front 
of a large crowd, but I felt like 
everyone presented it in a way 
that was very relatable.”

For Khan, the monologues 

were 
empowering 
and 

uplifting, reminding her that 
she has the power to speak out 
and make a difference.

“I saw a lot of love from 

the speakers and from the 
audience,” she said. “I saw a 
lot of sadness. It helped me 
realize that although there are 
differences in faith or lack of 
love, we all, regardless of our 
identities experience the same 
emotions, the same feelings of 
love and sadness. From tonight, 
I just want to remember that I 
can be vocal about my different 
identities and to know that there 
is support from the University.”

past 10 days, according to AAPD 
Detective Lieutenant Matthew 
Lige. Friday night’s incident was 
followed by a robbery on Saturday 
night and two armed robberies on 
Jan. 25.

Lige said the consistent pattern 

of the crimes should be worrisome 
to students.

“They 
have 
all 
occurred 

downtown near campus,” Lige said. 
“They all involve a U of M student. 
They all involve a student walking 
by himself or herself and in each 
case, a firearm has been produced 
with robbery being the motive.”

He also said all the robberies 

have taken place on side streets and 
areas of the city that are not well lit.

LSA 
junior 
Caroline 
Hurd 

said she lives in the area where 

the recent robberies have taken 
place. She plays club hockey at the 
University and often gets home late 
at night from practice. In light of 
the recent crimes, Hurd said she is 
now scared on her way home after 
practice.

“I’m pretty alarmed about it,” 

Hurd said. “I previously felt pretty 
safe living in a neighborhood that is 
so close to campus. I personally live 
right near East Quad, but with the 
recent armed robberies, I feel pretty 
unsafe being outside at night.”

In response to the series of 

robberies, Lige said AAPD is 
cooperating in full with DPSS on 
the cases. He also said the two 
forces are doing everything they 
can to track down the criminals and 
put this case to bed.

“This is obviously a priority 

investigation not only for the city 
police but also the University 
police,” Lige said. “We’ve been 
working 
with 
their 
detective 

bureau and their officers since we 
got the first two reports and now 
we’re even working with greater 
coordination than we had been 
because now we’ve got a total of 
four.”

The victim said he regretted 

not calling a cab and walking by 
himself.

“People should try and stay in 

groups or Uber home because this 
is an alarming trend,” he said.

Lige echoed the victim and said 

no physical possessions you own 
are worth risking your life over.

“If any student or member of 

the community is accosted in a 
way that we are seeing with these 
four, your backpack, your cell 
phone, your laptop is not worth 
you facing injury in any form or 
shape,” Lige said. “Those items 
can be recovered, they can be 
replaced, but obviously your well-
being and your physical health 
cannot be.”

work,” he said. “I’m asking 
you, I’m telling you, we need to 
get labor back in that boat.”

These 
speeches 
were 

followed by the forums for 
the candidates of treasurer 
and 
secretary, 
respectively. 

The second half of the day 
contained three forums: Vice 
chair for civic engagement and 
voter participation, vice chair, 
and chair.

Donna Brazile, the interim 

chair of the DNC, oversaw 
the Future Forum, and spoke 
about her faith in the party 
and its strength. Brazile set 
the tone for the forum, as 
many speakers would echo 
the theme of party unity and 

“rising up.”

“I believe in this party and 

I believe in its future,” Brazile 
said. “The comeback of the 
DNC is inevitable. We are 
going to come back, and come 
back now, we are going to win 
the seats back in 2018.”

Joining her, Dingell closed 

the first section of the morning 
session 
by 
delivering 
a 

concentrated statement about 
the necessity to unite the part 
under one common message.

“We need to unite under 

one goal and message,” Dingell 
said. “If we don’t, this country 
is becoming a country of 
billionaires and a country that 
people want to escape from, 
not come to.”

The forum formally began 

when 
Stephen 
Henderson 

took the stage to moderate 
the discussion between the 

two candidates for treasurer. 
Henderson, 
a 
University 

of Michigan alum and the 
Detroit Free Press editorial 
page editor, moderated the 
forum between all competing 
candidates.

Throughout their responses 

to questions on how they 
intend to rebuild the party, 
many candidates placed an 
emphasis on rallying behind 
the younger generation of the 
party.

One of the nine candidates 

for vice chair, Liz Jaff, who 
identified 
as 
a 
millennial, 

stated she believes that her 
generation is ready to be 
mobilized, but referred to 
needing a stronger sense of 
party-wide unity.

universities and with University 
departments and researchers is 
essential to this preservation work.

“The 
collaborative 
effort 

is really the thing that makes 
this go, whether it’s between 
people collaborating within the 
U of M, Noa and myself to our 
biology librarians to our SNRE 
librarians, that’s the piece that 
really makes this happen,” Schell 
said.

Kasman said the inspiration for 

these ongoing events came from 
a similar event at the University 
of Toronto in December and was 
modeled after an event hosted by 
the University of Pennsylvania 
earlier this month. She also said 
the coordination of this project 
helped preserve the data, and 
does so in a way that will make it 
practical for future use.

“The anticipation of what you 

want the final project to look 
like and how you want things 
to be useful and retrievable for 

people is there, and I think that 
that’s really important,” she said. 
“Just having people coordinated 
over that effort across all of 
these 
different 
universities, 

and 
geographically 
being 

able to have some sort of core 
coordination over that makes it 
so that whatever it is that we’re 
producing is going to have the 
greater potential of being useful.”

Kristine 
Auwers, 
a 

Information master’s student, 
helped 
familiarize 
volunteers 

with the archiving process at 
the event. She said she felt the 
archiving efforts provided a place 
to make direct, visible change.

“There are a lot of ways to be 

involved with activism, but doing 
a direct action that is something 
that is immediately useful is a 
unique opportunity,” she said.

Auwers also noted how these 

efforts, while related to the 
current political climate, was not 
a partisan effort.

“You could see a support for an 

action for this that’s bipartisan,” 
she said. “We have people who are 
concerned about climate change 
and accurate data reporting on 

both sides of the aisle.”

Kasman said in addition to 

making a material difference by 
preserving data, she hopes the 
efforts raise awareness of the 
importance of archiving.

“I also really like the idea of 

people being more aware of the 
Internet archiving that they 
can do,” she said. “Obviously 
this coordinated effort, it’s 
really important and I think it’s 
great that we have people who 
are participating. But I think 
it’s also empowering for them 
to see, ‘I can archive these 
websites on my own as well, I 
can use tools like the internet 
archive to save websites that 
I think are important to be 
saved.’”

Schell said though he is not 

sure of the particulars, he aims 
to have more events like this in 
the future at the University.

“We want to work with the 

community of people who were 
there, not just the people who 
have expertise that we need 
getting data or researching this 
kind of data sets, but the people 
who just want to help,” he said.

USA’s status in science will 
continue to plummet.”

At the end of January, 

Trump released an executive 
order that halts citizens of 
Muslim-majority 
countries 

such as Syria and Somalia from 
traveling or immigrating to 
the United States for a period 
of three months. The order 
sparked criticism and protest 
across the countries, as many 
viewed it to be discriminatory 
toward Muslims and fatal 
toward those fleeing violence 
in their home countries.

Judge 
James 
Robart 
of 

Seattle temporarily blocked 
the order this weekend, ruling 
that all green card and visa 
holders should still be allowed 
to enter the country during 
this period.

It is uncertain how this 

development 
will 
affect 

Razavi’s ability to enter the 
country.

The University community 

was 
concerned 
about 
the 

effects the travel ban might 
have on higher education as 

a whole. Several petitions 
have 
circulated 
around 

the 
University, 
asking 
for 

administration 
support 
of 

refugees who were affected by 
the order.

University President Mark 

Schlissel released a statement 
last weekend affirming the 
University’s commitment to 
its 
international 
students, 

staff and faculty.

“The university complies 

with 
federal 
requirements 

associated 
with 
managing 

its international programs,” 
Schlissel 
wrote 
in 
his 

statement. 
“Otherwise, 
the 

university 
does 
not 
share 

sensitive 
information 
like 

immigration status.”

Smith’s 
post 
has 
been 

shared more than 120 times, 
and other members of the 
University community showed 
their 
support 
for 
Razavi 

and distaste for the ban in 
comments on the post.

In a follow-up comment 

on her post yesterday, Smith 
updated followers on how 
the Math department would 
proceed with the situation.

“We 
hope 
Razavi 
will 

give his Sumner Myers talk 
in Switzerland and we will 
livestream it on a big screen 
to our colloquium,” Smith 
wrote.

O

n 
Jan. 
16, 
Claudia 

Rankine 
spoke 
at 

Rackham 
Auditorium 

about 
her 
book-

length 
poem, 

“Citizen: 
An 

American 
Lyric.” 

There 
was 
an 

exchange during the 
question-and-answer 
portion that I will 
expound upon here:

Crowd Member: I 

want to preface my 
question by saying 
I come from an all-
white 
suburb 
which 

does nothing for Martin Luther 
King Day. Where people have 
Confederate flags hanging out of 
the back of their pickup trucks.

Claudia Rankine: Oh, so you 

come from America.

This moment had a profound 

effect on me. It made me reckon 
with the way in which I imagine 
the United States based on New 
York City, where I grew up, and 
the diverse group with which I 
rode subways every day.

I do not mean to suggest 

that New York City is some 
egalitarian 
wonderland 
— 

far from it. Eventually, the 
subway ride ends, and I come 
out onto streets, which are 
starkly 
divided 
by 
color, 

creed and background. The 
subway ride, then, serves as 
a moment, a fleeting blip, 
in which the influence and 
existence altogether of certain 
fundamentally 
American 

barriers seems to dwindle.

And I think this blip, this 

moment, which allowed me 
throughout 
my 
childhood 

to view the United States as 
wholly egalitarian and diverse, 
also spreads to people who 
grow up in almost entirely 
white suburbs, who did not 
experience this daily blip in the 
form of subway rides. Instead, 
it might have come in the form 
of certain narratives promoted 
by the media, by their teachers 
and their textbooks, etc. And 
this blip expands and can very 
easily consume us until it is all 
we see.

In the above interaction, the 

crowd member subconsciously 
tries to transcend the world she 
knows in order to align herself 
and her experience with the 
United States in the world of 
that fictitious blip. According 
to 
a 
Brookings 
Institution 

study, if zero is a measure for 

perfect integration and 100 is 
complete segregation, the U.S.’s 
largest 
metropolitan 
areas 

have 
segregation 

levels between 50 
and 
70. 
Yet 
this 

crowd 
member 
— 

along with me and 
millions of others — 
has been taught that 
our lived experience 
of 
a 
segregated, 

divided 
country 

does not resemble 
the 
real 
United 

States.
And Rankine, whose 

work 
deals 
explicitly 
with 

the white imagination and 
its deleterious consequences, 
demands that we do not allow 
this 
collective, 
dominant 

imagination 
to 
shape 
our 

perception 
of 
the 
United 

States, but, instead, that we 
scrupulously and skeptically 
interrogate what we see and 
feel every day.

Amanda 
Alexander, 

assistant professor of Afro-
American 
studies 
at 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan, 

introduced Rankine’s lecture 
introduced the lecture with an 
excerpt from Rankine’s poetry: 
“Because white men cannot 
police 
their 
imaginations, 

Black men are dying.”

In her discussion, Rankine 

also mentioned the 2016 film 
“Moonlight,” 
whose 
main 

character, Chiron, is a closeted 
homosexual. As a child, Chiron 
is nicknamed “Little” because 
of his small size and meek 
personality. But as he gets 
older, Chiron gets extremely 
buff. We see him at the gym 
lifting massive weights; he 
has 
physically 
transformed. 

Rankine connected this muscle 
building to a trend she sees 
among Black Americans at 
large: She argued that Chiron 
tones his body this way as a 
shield for the evil, restricting 
world around him.

I 
would 
like 
to 
extend 

Rankine’s point to white people 
and, specifically, to the person 
who chose to preface her 
question by saying she comes 
from a homogenous, racist 
town, for the purposes of saying 
she comes from a wild, unusual 
place: This is indeed also a 
shield against the dangerous 
and scary idea that the United 
States 
is 
a 
homogenous, 

racist place. This shield, like 

Chiron’s, stems directly from 
the dominant narratives that 
we are told: Chiron is forced to 
transcend his actual identity 
because of the homophobic 
world around him. Likewise, 
this crowd member was forced 
to transcend her background 
because 
of 
the 
insistence 

of the dominant narratives 
about the United States that 
this is indeed a relentlessly 
egalitarian, democratic place.

This reminds me of Shaun 

King’s discussion at Rackham 
Auditorium on Jan. 23, in 
which he continually asked the 
question, “If this is true, how 
is this true?” Then he would 
show two consecutive images: 
The first might be a graph that 
shows linear human progress 
over time, therefore situating 
the present moment with the 
pinnacle of our progress, while 
the second image might be a 
video taken in 2016 of a young 
boy being shot and killed by 
the police. If Black people are 
being murdered by the police, 
if Donald Trump was just 
elected, we cannot be at the 
pinnacle of our progress.

Instead, King posited that 

history operates in a series of 
what he called “dips:” moments 
in which humanity regresses 
intellectually, politically and 
socially. Crucially, King noted 
that in American history, these 
dips always take place after 
what he called “introductions 
of 
innovation.” 
His 
first 

example 
was 
the 
end 
of 

slavery, which was followed by 
an era of Jim Crow laws and 
segregation. His next example 
was the civil rights movement, 
which was followed by the 
war 
on 
drugs 
and 
mass 

incarceration. 
Finally, 
he 

noted that the election of 
our first Black president was 
followed by the election of 
Donald Trump.

So today we live in a dip. 

It seems to me that the only 
way out of a dip, just like the 
only way out of any difficult 
situation ever, is to face it, to 
name it, to recognize it and to 
call it what it is. And this is what 
Rankine was getting at with 
her response: She was calling 
the 
questioner’s 
experience 

one 
that 
is 
foundationally, 

centrally and fully American.

I 

have observed the price of 
a candy bar in the vending 
machines on the University 

of Michigan’s campus rise 40 
percent since 2006. A Coke, 
60 percent. The cost of an 
employee membership at the 
Recreational Sports facilities, 
100 percent. An employee meal 
in a residence hall cafeteria, 
145 percent.

For the members of the 

American 
Federation 
of 

State, County and Municipal 
Employees contracted to work 
at the University, this poses a 
significant problem. Who are 
these AFSCME workers, you 
ask? They are your custodians, 
maintenance 
mechanics, 

groundskeepers, bus drivers, 
cooks, food service workers, 
patient transporters and so 
much more. 

The University community 

expressed in last November’s 
election 
a 
concern 
about 

income inequality and what 
can be done about it. While 
those at the top are earning far 
more than they need, those at 
the bottom do not earn enough 
to live in the area. Maybe the 
fight against income inequality 
seemed like a distant far away 
battle that nothing could be 
done about locally, but that 
fight is here, on this campus.

It does not matter what a 

person’s job is or how much 
they make. If prices and the 
costs of everyday goods and 
services rise faster than their 
income, they lose purchasing 
power. 
For 
people 
at 
the 

bottom end of the income scale 
this loss is more noticeable 
more quickly. While President 
Schlissel enjoys a pay raise 
that by itself is more than a 

full-time custodian makes in a 
year, as a member of AFSCME, 
I can no longer afford the same 
standard of living today as I 
could 20, 10 or even five years 
ago. Unless their spouse works, 
they get a second job or have 
some other secondary source of 
income, they have been forced 
to make decisions about what 
they can live without. Some 
have 
no 
television 
service 

and drive cars older than 
incoming 
freshman. 
Some 

wear old worn-out clothing 
and carpool, while others live 
with their parents or other 
families to save on costs. There 
is a certain amount of injustice 
when a person gives most or 
all of their working adult lives 
to a company or organization 
and cannot afford the same 
standard of living at the end as 
they had at the beginning.

Low wages have made it 

difficult to meet basic living 
costs. Food prices are 30 
percent higher on average than 
they were in 2006. Rent in the 
Ann Arbor area has risen 14 
percent in the last five years 
alone. The average rent is now 
$1,075 per month, which would 
leave very little money for 
these workers to cover all other 
living 
expenses, 
assuming 

they have the cheapest health 
insurance 
option 
available 

and no children. They still 
have not paid any utilities, 
transportation 
expenses 
or 

bought any food. To combat 
these high living expenses, 
some people choose to live 
outside of the city, which 
increases traveling expenses 
such as gasoline and parking.

As bad as those numbers 

are, it only gets worse when 

health expenses are factored 
in. Since 2003, the monthly 
premiums 
these 
men 
and 

women pay for their health 
insurance have risen from 
zero out-of-pocket expense 
for premiums and a very 
low co-pay to $42 a month 
for the lowest cost Preferred 
Provider Organization option 
premiums. 
The 
University-

provided 
prescription 
drug 

plan is still free, but there are 
drugs it covered then that it no 
longer covers, and the co-pays 
for generic drugs are now five 
times higher than they were 
before. The co-pay for name 
brand prescriptions is even 
higher. The problem becomes 
even larger if they have an 
adult dependent or children to 
carry on their insurance. 

Washtenaw 
Community 

College, 
Eastern 
Michigan 

University, 
Michigan 
State 

University 
and 
Ohio 
State 

University all pay their service 
and maintenance employees 
$4,000 to $6,000 more per 
year than the University of 
Michigan, reflecting a better 
understanding 
of 
the 
cost 

of living in the areas those 
schools are located in. Not only 
would the men and women of 
AFSCME benefit from a wage 
increase matching those peer 
institutions, but the Ann Arbor 
area and state economy would 
as well. The time to tell the 
administration that the people 
who work here meeting the 
community’s needs on a daily 
basis should be paid enough to 
live in or near the community 
they serve is now.

Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
4A — Monday, February 6, 2017

I

n the winter of 2007, 10-year-
old 
me 
bitterly 
watched 

then-Senator 
Barack 

Obama announce his bid for the 
presidency from his hometown of 
Chicago, Illinois. As I sat on my 
grandmother’s bed, arms folded, 
I lamented, “He is going to take 
my job! I want to be the first Black 
president!” She rubbed my back 
and with a smile said, “He might 
actually win, and it would be good 
for us.” I grimaced. “But don’t 
worry, you can be the second Black 
president.”

Although I was not initially 

onboard with this funny-named 
candidate, I eventually conceded 
to my grandmother’s rationale. 
Maybe he would be good for us. 
Within no time, I was my field 
office’s youngest volunteer for 
his 
campaign: 
calling 
voters, 

posting signs and canvassing 
neighborhoods.

On election night in 2008, I 

celebrated 
with 
screams 
and 

applause while my mom cried 
tears of joy and my entire family 
watched him accumulate 270 
electoral votes. On Inauguration 
Day, I stayed home from school 
to watch the first person who 
looked like me take the oath of 
office, after 43 other men had done 
the same. For generations, Black 
parents have told their children 
to aspire to be the best thing that 
they could be, even the president 
of the United States. However, that 
opportunity, although optimistic, 
had not been previously attainable. 
With the election of President 
Barack Obama, we now know this 
opportunity is real.

Representation matters, and the 

visual of a Black first family was 
undeniably inspiring to African 
Americans all over the country. 
However, the Obama message 
resonated with myself and so 
many others on a deeper level. 
‘Hope’ was not just a slogan, it 
was our feeling. ‘Change’ was not 
just an empty campaign promise, 
it was our premonition. And 

Obama came through on these 
commitments, leaving our country 
better off.

President 
Obama 
appointed 

a record number of women and 
racial minorities to his cabinet 
and nominated the nation’s first 
Hispanic Supreme Court justice. 
During his administration, there 
were more LGBTQ ambassadors 
representing this country around 
the world than ever before. His 
army secretary was gay. The first 
full-time 
transgender 
White 

House employee worked in his 
West Wing.

I celebrated the president’s 

successes as though they were my 
own, and bore the weight of his 
failures just the same. Despite the 
harsh criticism President Obama 
faced for exercising a “feeble” 
foreign policy, I was reassured 
by the fact that after nearly eight 
years of a more hawkish (and 
failed) pursuit, U.S. special forces 
— under the president’s command 
— successfully found and killed 
Osama bin Laden. Inversely, the 
debacle induced by the Affordable 
Care Act, his namesake domestic 
policy, was incredibly frustrating. 

After 
President 
Obama’s 

election, there was talk of America 
being a “post-racial” society. To 
many, the new Black commander 
in chief served as a mark of our 
country progressing beyond its 
ugly past of prejudice and racial 
inequity. However idealistic, this 
claim was hardly the reality. At 
the peak of the recession, I heard 
the 
Republican 
congressional 

leadership vow to make his 
presidency unsuccessful. I heard 
a lawmaker shout, “You lie!” in the 
middle of a speech to a joint session 
of Congress. Confirmations for 
President Obama’s nominations 
stalled due to partisan obstruction 
that lasted longer than those of any 
other chief executive. Between 
2008 and 2016, the nation became 
desensitized to the unprecedented 
lament of a president whose 
legitimacy was questioned nearly 
his entire governance.

As a Black man, Obama’s 

presidency made me feel like I 

mattered. His assertion that if 
he had a son, “He would look 
like 
Trayvon 
(Martin)” 
was 

poignant to me and so many other 
African Americans at a time of 
heightened 
racial 
animosity. 

In light of the many killings of 
unarmed Black men caught on 
camera and circulated via mass 
media, I applauded his efforts to 
reform police departments around 
the country. President Obama 
made himself accessible to at-risk 
minority youth with his mentoring 
program My Brother’s Keeper. 
He made criminal justice reform 
a household topic, and was the 
first sitting president to ever visit 
a prison. Although his economic 
policies benefited all Americans, 
Black unemployment in particular 
was decreased by a third. Obama 
administration policies have also 
improved high-school graduation, 
uninsured and incarceration rates 
in our community.

In 
recognizing 
the 
effect 

Barack Obama’s presidency had 
on my identity as an African 
American, it is just as important to 
acknowledge the intersectionality 
of my identities. As a gay man, I 
considered it a good start when 
he banned the “Don’t Ask, Don’t 
Tell” policy that was keeping so 
many LGBTQ service members 
in the closet. Then, when he came 
out in support of the legalization 
of same-sex marriage, and in-turn 
influenced the country to do the 
same, I felt as though I had a 
genuine ally in the White House.

President 
Obama 
was 
my 

president. I loved him because he 
looked like me, he cared about the 
same issues I did, and he fought for 
my interests. In the face of defiance, 
he actually made America great 
again. But I love him most because 
he was what we should all aspire to 
be: the bigger person. In the era of 
alternative facts, rising nationalism 
and heightened division, I will 
always keep his words near to my 
heart: “Choose hope over fear.”

Thank you, Mr. President.

Argentinian 
author 
Samanta 

Schweblin’s debut novel “Fever 
Dream” is titled after the vivid, 
hallucinatory 
dreams 
that 

accompany 
an 
illness. 
Except 

“Fever Dream” isn’t a dream. It’s 
a nightmare, one that glows with 
taut, sinister energy.

“They’re like worms,” it begins. 

Amanda lies dying in a hospital 
clinic, speaking to David, the son 
of her friend from her vacation 
hometown. 
He 
questions 
her, 

prodding her to recount her 
experience getting acquainted with 
him. He seems to be searching for 
something, but doesn’t explain 
what the worms mean, nor what 
sparks their importance.

Told entirely in sparse dialogue, 

“Fever Dream” leaks out just 
enough detail needed to invoke 
a sense of dread. Hints of evil 
permeate its pages, but its nature is 
undefined. “Nina!” Amanda often 
calls out for her daughter; “Where 
is Nina?”

There is no answer.
David dodges her questions, and 

tells her there isn’t much time left, 
to keep going, to keep telling the 
story. A sense of urgency pulses 
throughout, keeping the reader in 

a constant state of the unknown. 
“That’s 
not 
important,” 
he 

interrupts. “What happened next? 
What did she say?” Amanda wants 
to stay in her memories, wants to 
tell the story to completion. David 
impatiently shoves her forward, 
and we whip our heads backward 
in confusion, trying to grab hold 
of quickly vanishing details before 
we’re forced to fly on to the next.

Through 
their 
unsettling 

conversations, pieces of the story 
eventually emerge. After drinking 
water from a poisoned stream, 
David falls ill and his mother 
begs a witch healer to transplant 
his soul into another body. She 
warns that though he may survive 
physically, his soul will be split in 
two, leaving something “unknown” 
to fill the void. At David’s urging, 
Amanda recounts how her and her 
daughter, Nina’s lives change after 
encountering the new David.

Amanda 
obsesses 
over 
the 

“rescue distance” between Nina 
and herself, the physical proximity 

she must maintain to protect her 
daughter if something goes awry. 
She describes it as the “invisible 
thread” connecting them, one that 
tightens around her stomach to 
signal danger. It is through charting 
the ever-evolving length of this 
“rescue distance” that we circle 
closer to the truth.

With two unreliable narrators 

acting as the only portal to 
understand 
what 
happened, 

Amanda’s bewilderment and fear 
becomes the reader’s own. How 
much of the story is real, and how 
much of it is Amanda’s imagination? 
David sometimes corrects her, 
moves her to different places. Can 
we trust him? Everything about 
“Fever Dream” is dizzying, with 
the only certainty being the visceral 
need to protect one’s child.

It’s this uncertainty that makes 

“Fever 
Dream” 
so 
horrifying. 

Amanda knows just enough to 
realize that something is terribly 
wrong but cannot fix it. She’s stuck, 
a bystander in history, trapped in 
the sands of her own fate, with 
nothing to do but yield to her terror. 
“Fever Dream” harnesses the power 
of instinct, throwing its characters 
into 
a 
poisoned 
dreamworld, 

dissolving their social pretenses 
in the face of desperation, so that 
what’s left is the primal relationship 
between mother and child.

‘Dream’ a vivid nightmare

BOOK REVIEW

VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

Perhaps more than any other 

sub-par horror movie released 
recently, “Rings” aspires for a 
quality viewing experience. The 
filmmakers behind it are clearly 
passionate about their project, 
and 
while 
that 
enthusiasm 

doesn’t stop the film from being 
mostly forgettable, it makes it 
more digestible than one would 
assume. It’s creepy more often 
than not, and Director F. Javier 
Gutiérrez (“Before the Fall”) 
is skilled at the atmosphere-
building that made “The Ring” 
such a huge hit fifteen years ago.

However, in many ways, this 

competency behind the camera 
makes the reliance on genre 
clichés all the more frustrating. 
The 
atmosphere 

is 
well-conveyed, 

but 
the 
same 

jump 
scares 
and 

pointless 
dream 

sequences 
that 

pervade 
modern 

horror still make 
their 
presence 

known. 
The 
fact 

that it takes the 
more difficult road three times 
out of ten doesn’t make the other 
seven times it takes the easy way 
out any less infuriating.

This frustration applies to 

the story, as well. As with the 
original film, “Rings” feels like 
a horror movie disguised as a 
mystery, and it’s a genuinely 
interesting mystery that only 
becomes more involving as the 
plot moves along — until the end, 
that is (but there’ll be time for 
that calamity later). Its potential 
is squandered as the storytelling 
behind 
“Rings” 
becomes 

progressively more muddled. It 
can’t seem to choose between 
being a reboot or a sequel, and 
it settles for something halfway, 
alternatively 
following 
and 

changing series canon to suit 
the scene.

In addition, the story relies 

on a series of contrivances and 
plot holes to work, especially 
at the beginning. Characters 
frequently make decisions that 
make no sense, but they move 

the plot forward, so audiences 
are expected to accept them 
with 
no 
questions 
asked. 

Almost every moment feels 
manufactured, instead of letting 
the natural fear that drove the 
original do the talking.

With the exception of Johnny 

Galecki (“The Big Bang Theory”) 
playing against type, the cast 
doesn’t do particularly well with 
what they’re given, either. The 
central couple, as portrayed by 
Matilda Lutz (“Summertime”) 
and 
Alex 
Roe 
(“The 
5th 

Wave”), is one of the most self-
righteously pretentious couples 
in recent horror memory. Any 
relationship 
between 
two 

ostensible teenagers — both 
portrayed by twenty-six-year 
olds — that begins with them 
reciting 
the 
Greek 
tragedy 

of Orpheus as a thinly veiled 

metaphor for the 
plot is doomed to 
be 
unbearable, 

and 
Julia 
and 

Holt make this 
rule. They are 
so 
obnoxiously 

self-important 
both 
in 
the 

performances 
and 
in 
their 

relationship 
that 
they 
are 

insufferable. They strive to be 
likeable to such an extreme, 
off-putting extent that they’re 
anything but. The dialogue 
is wooden, sure, but it can’t 
shoulder all the blame.

All of this doesn’t add up 

to a bad movie, though. If 
“Rings” had ended five minutes 
before it does, it would have 
been 
anticlimactic, 
and 
it 

would have left some plot 
threads 
unresolved, 
but 
it 

would have been an average, 
even moderately likeable flick 
with positives to balance out 
its 
negatives. 
Then 
comes 

the “twist,” a lazy possession 
plotline that makes no sense — 
both for what the audience has 
been shown so far and for the 
new “rules” it sets up — and 
which damages the movie the 
longer it lasts. It is the kind of 
lazy, tacked-on non-sequitur 
that buries the merits of the 
film and elevates the flaws, 
ultimately resulting in a film 

more memorable for its failures 
than 
for 
its 
commendable 

ambitions.

‘Rings’ is abruptly uneven

NETFLIX

Drew Barrymore stars in “Santa Clarita Diet”

Marriage is messy — especially 

when mom has an insatiable 
hunger for human flesh and dad 
is trying hard to rock the suburbia 
lifestyle. At least, this is what 
“The Santa Clarita Diet” reminds 
us when real-estate agents Sheila 
(Drew Barrymore, “Blended”) 
and Joel (Timothy Olyphant, 
“Justified”) 
navigate 
a 
new 

normal as Sheila makes a sudden 
departure from the land of the 
living.

In a time when most couples 

face the demons of menopause 
and the infamous midlife crisis, 
Sheila seems to experience the 
opposite — her sex drive has 
tripled, she’s less uptight about 
parenting and she begins to 
experience the joys of clubbing. 
After all, the show is a satirical 
look at the zombie phenomenon. 
Where zombies drag themselves 
aimlessly, Sheila is excitable, 
rejuvenated with the newfound 
energy that accompanied her 
sudden death. Her complete one-
eighty in regards to personality is 
what makes a zombie, ultimately, 
a 
zombie. 
This 
phenomenon 

is noticed most by her teenage 
daughter Abby (Liv Hewson, 
“Before I Fall”), who notes the 
transformation 
on 
multiple 

occasions.

Where Sheila once worried 

about her daughter’s SAT scores, 
she now couldn’t care less if Abby 
were to drop out of high school 

altogether. Though at first she 
enjoys the more carefree side to 
her mom, as the series progresses, 
Abby’s distress regarding the 
current situation continues to 
grow. Her tough-girl exterior 
around neighbor and resident geek 
Eric (Skyler Gisondo, “Vacation”) 
slowly begins to shatter when she 
comes to realize the true extent 
of her mother’s condition. While 
they’re all eating spaghetti, mom 
is eating human brains. Hewson 
does 
remarkable 

work 
in 
the 

emotional baggage 
department, 
balancing acts of 
badassery 
with 

background 
depression as her 
cries for normalcy 
begin 
to 
make 

cracks in her stony exterior.

At the same time, as Sheila 

slurps 
on 
her 
blood-flavored 

protein shake, Joel just manages 
to keep it together. A former jock 
who has never fully adjusted 
into the suburban lifestyle, Joel 
struggles even harder to find 
balance when his wife joins the 
ranks of the undead. Perhaps it’s 
because of his insecurities that 
he chooses love over ethos, but 
Joel’s inability to get over the past 
is what ultimately drives him to 
agree to harvest people for food. 
As high school sweethearts, he 
can’t imagine, nor function, in a 
world without Sheila. Extremely 
protective, 
he 
spends 
most 

episodes desperately searching 
for 
a 
cure 
whilst 
dragging 

his 
sweetheart 
off 
hapless 

pedestrians. When neighbor and 
police officer Carlos (Ricardo 
Antonio 
Chavira, 
“Desperate 

Housewives”) 
becomes 

suspicious, 
Joel 
pushes 
the 

nervous smiles and half-thought 
out excuses with a fervor.

At times, however, Olyphant’s 

performance can feel forced and a 
tad overplayed, as his normal role 
as the Hollywood villain is tossed 
aside for the nervous and obedient 

husband. However, 
his 
chemistry 

with 
Barrymore 

is more believable 
than 
most 

on-screen couples. 
Practically picture-
perfect, the two 
complement 
one 
another 
in 

a manner that evens out their 
polarized 
personalities 
well, 

an aspect that many network 
shows spend episodes to even 
out. With the chemistry of the 
show constantly shifting from one 
episode to the next, “The Santa 
Clarita Diet” is a show that, though 
not binge-worthy material, will 
keep viewers coming back for 
the satirical sarcasm. Once the 
initial overkill, both literal and 
figurative, of the pilot passes, the 
series develops a steady rhythm 
accentuated by a passionate cast 
and the irresistible draw of brain 
smoothies.

The first season of “The 

Santa Clarita Diet” is currently 
streaming on Netflix in its 
entirety.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Over the past two weeks, my 

brain has felt like it’s split in two: a 
frivolous half and an anxious half. 
I’m spending my days nervously 
refreshing 
Twitter, 
monitoring 

updates from the Oval Office and 
wondering which country the 
President has offended today, or 
which Americans’ rights are now in 

jeopardy.

At the same time, however, 

I can’t help but be occasionally 
preoccupied by the same random 
pleasures I’ve always enjoyed. 
What’s going to happen on season 
two of “The Good Place?” I wonder, 
guiltily. Will Michigan’s basketball 
team make the tournament? It’s like 
there’s an oasis of escapism right 
in the middle of my stressed-out 
mind.

One of the only artists that’s 

doing much to bridge this gap 
has actually been U2, a band I’ve 
looked at to try to make sense 
of what art can do and what it 
can mean right now, in such an 
unpredictable, threatening world. 
While U2 has been around for 
so long that it’s hard to imagine 
them as anything other than the 
legendary 
institution 
they’ve 

become, back in the ’80s, they 
were a young, hungry, disruptively 
fresh band with grand political 

ambitions. And, as Irishmen, they 
also had a lot of familiarity with 
living in a country divided to the 
point of violent extremes.

There’s an almost religious 

power in the first decade of U2’s 
work. Their albums are filled 
with songs of faith, hope, love and 
passion. They seek to speak out 
against injustice, to provide clarity 
to the unknown terrors of the 
world. The music is unwaveringly 
committed and direct. You can 
imagine millions of people around 
the world closing their eyes and 
feeling Bono’s words flow through 
them. Songs like the classic, searing 
indictment of “Sunday Bloody 
Sunday” or the beautiful elegy for 
Martin Luther King, Jr., “Pride,” 
can stir emotions and demand 
thought and action like few other 
songs.

But one can see why the band 

turned away from these types 
of protest anthems in the ’90s. 
There’s a great power in the ability 
to spread messages to millions 
of people, to have thousands of 
fans every night sing words you 
wrote. It must also be incredibly 
intimidating, and in the ’90s, U2 
seemed to retreat behind a curtain 
of post-modern irony, with Bono 
portraying characters on stage 
and the songs often carrying much 
more superficial meanings.

The only example of the old 

spiritual power from this era 
comes on Achtung Baby’s famous 
“One.” When people accuse Bono 
of having a “savior complex,” this 
is the song they’re thinking of, a 
slow ballad that maybe doesn’t 
get enough credit for Bono’s vocal 
performance and thoughtful lyrics. 
However, it represents a permanent 
shift in the band’s point of view. In 
“One,” Bono comes off as a larger-
than-life presence, a man looking 
down on humanity and evaluating 
all the lives he sees. U2 was playing 
the biggest concerts any band could 
by the time of Achtung’s release, 
and they had lost their everyman 

perspective. The members of U2 
were 
professionals, 
no 
longer 

passionate young men living in 
Dublin. Their view of the world 
came not from the streets anymore, 
but from the largest stages their 
employees could build.

When 
U2 
reversed 
course 

and put out 2000’s All That You 
Can’t Leave Behind, a no-frills 
rock album that attempted to 
win back the fans who had been 
put off by the self-indulgence and 
experimentation of their last few 
records, their attempts at anthems 
lacked the fiery conviction of their 
youth. Empty platitudes and vague 
choruses fill All That You Can’t 
Leave Behind’s runtime, as the 
songs try harder to evoke memories 
of the old U2 rather than say 
anything meaningful. Since that 
album, while they still retain their 
live power, the band has seemed 
lost on record, and at times it’s very 
unclear what’s motivating them 
to write new songs beyond market 
demand.

But this year, after fiercely 

resisting the label of “nostalgia 
act,” U2 has announced a tour 
celebrating the 30-year anniversary 
of 1987’s The Joshua Tree — 
probably the band’s most essential 
work — in which they’ll play the 
album in its entirety on a nightly 
basis.

It’s certainly an interesting time 

for U2 to come back to this record. 
Recorded in an era of revived 
conservatism, Joshua is an album 
that celebrates both the best and 
attacks the worst of America. It’s 
an ode to discovery, with songs 
like “Where the Streets Have No 
Name” conjuring feelings of endless 
freedom and “I Still Haven’t Found 
What I’m Looking For” conveying 
a restless need to find something 
greater than yourself. But it also 
doesn’t shy away from political 
realities. “Bullet the Blue Sky” is 
U2 at its rawest, with the Edge’s 
feedback-drenched guitar slashing 
through Adam Clayton’s lumbering 

bass as a furious Bono takes the 
Reagan administration to task for 
its Central American policy.

The Joshua Tree is the perfect 

album for this moment in history 
because it simultaneously explores 
two Americas. There’s the ideal 
conception of America as a place 
of freedom and endless possibility, 
but it’s tainted by the reality that 
sometimes the people who run 
this country are nothing more 
than greedy bastards. Joshua Tree 
doesn’t solve that conflict or even 
attempt to bridge the gap. It lets this 
vision of America stay split in two.

But does it matter now? Will 

this tour work? Will anyone who 
isn’t already converted care? If 
The Joshua Tree affects other 
Americans like it’s affecting me 
right now, then I think so. Right 
now is a time when millions of 
Americans feel lost in their own 
homes, with many losing faith in 
the humanity of their neighbors or 
wondering what “land of the free” 
even means anymore. Old pleasures 
feel hollow, and previous ideas of 
who we are don’t seem to make 
sense. We’ve been left questioning 
where we are, and what our 
purpose is.

The 
Joshua 
Tree 
doesn’t 

answer those questions, but no 
album has ever made me think 
more about my place in the 
world. It doesn’t shy away from 
portraying my home country the 
way it truly is, but it also presents 
inspiring American images worth 
aspiring to. To some, fantasizing 
about running through a place 
“where the streets have no name” 
might be pure escapism, but it’s a 
powerful call to build a real place 
that lives up to our ideals. When 
they recorded Joshua, U2 was 
still a band searching, unsure 
of their duty in a chaotic, unjust 
world. But amid corruption and 
conflict, they offered a helping 
hand towards unity and reminded 
us of the beauty in our home that 
was still worth pursuing.

Ohio State 6, Michigan 5

Ohio State 70, Michigan 66

The defensive problems were 

still there, and while that did not 
matter Friday night, it came back 
to bite the Michigan hockey team 
in the second game of its series 
against No. 11 Ohio State.

Just one night after nearly 

blowing a four-goal lead, the Wol-
verines surrendered six goals to 
the Buckeyes in the second game 
of the weekend series. On Friday, 
Michigan held on for a 5-4 vic-
tory, but it could not do the same 
Saturday, blowing a two-goal lead 
to fall, 6-5.

“... We have to play better in the 

third period,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “... They were the 
better team in 
the third period. 
Maybe they’re the 
better team on 
paper, but we’ve 
got to play better. 
I don’t care about 
the paper, what 
the paper says. 
Our team has to 
play better. We’ve 
got to play better 
in our own zone, 
and we’ve got to 
play better in their zone. We didn’t 
have enough push in this game, we 
didn’t have enough second efforts 

or leadership to make a difference 
in the game. Disappointing. That’s 
all I’ve got to say.”

The Wolver-

ines gave up too 
many power plays 
and too many 
chances from near 
the crease and in 
the slot — both 
recurring themes 
throughout this 
season — which 
made things dif-
ficult for Hayden 
Lavigne. The 
freshman goalten-

der was outstanding, stopping 29 
of 35 shots, and made big save after 
big save to limit the damage.

At times, Lavigne’s play ap-

peared to be enough. While 
Michigan’s defense struggled, its 
offense continued 
to play well — 
but just not well 
enough to make up 
for the defensive 
shortcomings in 
the end. The Wol-
verines (2-7-1 Big 
Ten, 9-13-2 overall) 
poured in five 
goals, keeping pace 
with the Buckeyes 
(4-5-1, 13-7-6) for 
most of the night.

“I think we were getting pucks 

to the net a lot more this week-
end,” said freshman forward Jake 

Slaker. “Probably these last two 
games were the most shots we’ve 
had in any game this season, so 

that’s something 
we’ve really 
worked on in prac-
tice, just getting 
pucks to the net 
and bodies to the 
net.”

Saturday’s game 

was a chippy, back-
and-forth affair, as 
both teams traded 
big hits and the 
lead.

The Buckeyes 

jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the 
first period when forward Nick 
Schilkey sniped one past Lavi-

gne on an Ohio State power play. 
Michigan responded quickly, 
though, off sophomore forward 
Cooper Marody’s goal — his fourth 
of the weekend after a natural hat 
trick Friday — that tied things at 
one. The Buckeyes took the lead 
once more just three minutes later 
before Michigan responded in a 
big way.

Senior defenseman Sam Pi-

azza’s sixth goal of the season tied 
things up at two, and then Slaker’s 
power-play goal gave his team a 
3-2 lead.

Marody continued his hot 

streak on offense in the second 
period. His pass during a 2-on-1 

Derrick Walton Jr. has started 

over 100 games for Michigan in 
his career, and the Wolverines 
have needed every minute of 
his experience, leadership, and 
will to win in its recent stretch 
of games.

Walton came into Saturday’s 

contest against Ohio State (4-7 
Big Ten, 14-10 overall) averaging 
18.6 points and 6.2 rebounds in 
Michigan’s past five games.

The senior guard had proven 

to his team and the Wolverine 
faithful that any hopes of a top-
half Big Ten finish and NCAA 
Tournament trip rested upon his 
shoulders.

So when Michigan (4-6, 14-9) 

faced a four-point deficit with 
just over half a minute to go, 

everyone knew who and where 
the Wolverines’ next shot was 
going to come from.

Within just a few ticks of the 

clock, Walton had the ball in 
his hands, positioned behind 
the 3-point line, 
corked to fire the 
shot that would 
bring Michigan 
within a point of 
digging out of a 
second-half hole 
it had dug itself 
into.

To no one’s 

surprise, Walton 
hit the shot, and 
after the Buck-
eyes missed a free 
throw on the other end, Walton 
had the ball in his hands again 
to potentially send the game to 
overtime or even win it outright.

But Walton, whose body was 

moving faster than anyone’s 

in Crisler Center on Saturday, 
rushed the shot, pulling up from 
two with 16 seconds remaining, 
and watched it clank off the rim.

Ohio State extended its lead 

to four following a pair of free 

throws, and time 
had run out for 
the Wolverines to 
come back, falling 
to the Buckeyes, 
70-66.

“I took a shot 

I thought was 
the best shot 
available,” Walton 
said. “I’ve made 
that shot a thou-
sand times. Kind 
of left it short, 

but, again, the ball just didn’t 
go in.”

Michigan had clawed back 

from multiple eight-point defi-
cits to make the game close in its 
final possessions. Walton spear-

headed the Wolverines’ effort, 
finishing with a season-high 25 
points and 10 rebounds. Sixteen 
of his points came in the second 
half, in which Michigan never 
had the lead, though it had tied 
the game on two 
occasions.

With 4:23 left 

on the clock, 
Walton hit one of 
his six 3-pointers 
on the night to 
knot the game at 
60. Two minutes 
later, redshirt 
sophomore for-
ward DJ Wilson 
dialed up from 
deep to tie the 
game at 63 — the closest the 
Wolverines would be to tasting a 
lead in the final 20 minutes.

Michigan’s struggles were 

exposed within the opening 1:08 
of the second half, when sopho-

more forward Moritz Wagner 
and Wilson had each picked up 
their third fouls. The Wolver-
ines had no choice but to rely 
on two bench players — senior 
forward Mark Donnal and red-

shirt junior wing 
Duncan Robinson 
— to carry the 
load for the two 
most productive 
players in their 
frontcourt.

Michigan 

had an 11-point 
advantage in the 
first half, but that 
lead evaporated 
as the Buckeyes’ 
big men began 

to bully the Wolverines’ post 
defenders down low. Ohio State 
went into halftime with a one-
point lead thanks to a massive 
20-8 advantage it had on the 
glass. Of the Buckeyes’ 20 first-

half rebounds, 10 came on the 
offensive end, allowing them 
to keep possessions alive and 
the ball away from Michigan on 
offense.

Ohio State ended up hand-

ily winning the contest on the 
boards, outrebounding the 
Wolverines 42-24 on the night, 
including a 16-7 advantage on 
the offensive glass.

“In a game when it looked 

like it was so under control from 
the first couple minutes of the 
game, things turned with all the 
missed shots they had and the 
offensive rebounds they got,” 
Walton said. “We just got to 
get back to the basics of being 
tough.”

With its two key big men 

in foul trouble and without an 
answer to the Buckeyes’ domi-
nance inside, Michigan knew

A swimmer, his father and an executive order

M

okhtar Al-Yamani 
just wants to see his 
dad and swim for his 

country. He has a father, Ali, from 
Yemen and a future competing in 
the Olympics. But for him, as for 
so many 
others, 
by the 
end of 
the day 
on Jan. 
27, the 
world 
had 
changed.

The 

19-year-
old 
sophomore swimmer at Michigan 
is hoping to travel to Baku, 
Azerbaijan, in May to swim for 
Yemen in the Islamic Solidarity 
Games. Now he doesn’t know for 
sure if he’ll be allowed to come 
back.

He is an American citizen, born 

in New York. His Japanese mother 
and Yemeni father met in college 
at the University of Kentucky 
and then moved when Mokhtar 
was a baby back to Japan, where 
Mokhtar grew up. So Al-Yamani is 
a triple citizen of the United States, 
Japan and Yemen, by virtue of his 
parents.

His next chance to swim for 

his father’s home country is still 
shrouded in uncertainty by the 
controversial executive order 
from President Donald Trump. 
The order suspended entry by 
citizens of seven majority Muslim 
nations, including Yemen, into 
the United States. Since then, 
Al-Yamani has kept his eyes on 
the news in search of what that 
policy means for him.

Reports from the White 

House have been unclear in the 
days following the ban about 
exactly whom it impacts, but as 
of now, Al-Yamani appears to 
be unaffected as a U.S. citizen. 
On Jan. 29, CNN reported that a 
State Department official told the 
network that the ban “should not 

affect dual-national Americans 
(like Al-Yamani) at all.” But 
Al-Yamani will keep following 
the news because he knows much 
could still change between now 
and May.

The government has already 

modified enforcement of the policy 
in the past 10 days; the Baku trip is 
in three months. And the fact that 
he’ll be traveling with a Yemeni 
passport to the Islamic Solidarity 
Games has Al-Yamani worried.

“I know the Yemeni delegation 

is really excited for me to go, and 
I’m excited to compete there 
also,” he said, “but it is troubling 
times.”

For now, Al-Yamani will focus 

on his collegiate season, though 
that causes another problem. 
Later this month, he will compete 
in the Big Ten Championships. 
His father, a citizen of only 
Yemen, will not be able to come 
see him.

Ali Al-Yamani, who lives in 

Japan separately from Mokhtar’s 
mother, passed down a middle 
name and a heritage to his son. 
He keeps up with Yemeni news 
and listens to Yemeni music. His 
home has couches with traditional 
Arabian designs and a room 
dedicated for prayer to the Muslim 
faith (Ali is Muslim, Mokhtar is 
not).

And while the executive 

order’s implication on Mokhtar 
is unclear, the 19-year-old has 
struggled to come to terms with 
an administration that deems his 
father unwelcome here. Mokhtar 
knows that his father thinks the 
travel ban is “outrageous,” but 
the two haven’t talked at length 
about it.

“He’s just told me that he won’t 

be able to come to Big Tens, and he 
just said not to worry about (him, 
he’ll) be fine,” Al-Yamani said.

But does Al-Yamani worry 

about his father, in light of recent 
events? “Yeah, because I don’t 
know if he’ll ever be able to come.”

Al-Yamani did not seem angry 

as much as he did incredulous, still 
six days after the executive order 
was signed. He was not eager to 
turn his situation into a political 
statement. He worried mostly 
about swimming and seeing his 
family, which he could do until 
a man he has never met signed 
a piece of paper making both 
uncertain.

“It seemed like such a far-

fetched idea, no one would pass it,” 
Al-Yamani said. “And then he just 
singlehandedly did.”

Again, Al-Yamani tries to 

stick to positives: His father lives 
in Japan, where he is safe, and 
Al-Yamani noted that several 
other countries have voiced their 
opposition to the travel ban, 
putting pressure on the United 
States. If Al-Yamani is able to 

travel to Baku in May, his father 
plans to join him for the occasion.

“He’s very proud of me,” 

Al-Yamani said. “Just the fact 
that even after living in Japan 
all these years, I chose to 
represent his home country, 
I think he’s really happy for 
that.”

Al-Yamani began competing 

for Yemen to have a better 
chance of making an Olympic 
team. In advance of last 
summer’s Rio Games, he made 
the international swimming 
federation’s B-cut qualifying 
time and was even issued 
credentials. But he couldn’t go 
to Rio as a Yemeni wild card 
— the Olympic designation for 
the fastest man and woman 
in certain small countries — 
because he hadn’t competed in 
the 2015 World Championships.

In the end, despite his time, 

he didn’t make it into the field of 

athletes, which was capped at 
900. Still, he was encouraged by 
the journey and looks forward 
to continuing his international 
career at the 2020 Olympics in his 
hometown of Tokyo.

That’s a bright future, but 

questions surround much of it. 
Al-Yamani wants to compete 
for the country of which his 
father is so proud, but the travel 
situation puts that dream in 
doubt. He hopes to travel to 
Yemen to learn more about the 
culture for himself, but the 
country’s civil war makes that 
a dangerous proposition for 
now. And he’s trying to learn 
Arabic to connect with a fellow 
Yemeni swimmer, Ebrahim 
Al-Maleki, whom he would have 
met in December in Canada if 
Al-Maleki’s visa had not been 
denied. Now, Al-Yamani must 
live with uncertainty.

“I don’t want to talk too much 

about my own political opinion on 
each of the candidates,” Al-Yamani 
said. “But I do feel that, completely 
policies aside, I think that 
someone who’s going to lead an 
entire country should have more 
morals and just human character 
than Trump had shown during his 
election. I guess we’ve seen more 
of Trump during the election than 
during his presidency so far, but 
we’ll just have to see where that 
goes.”

When news of the executive 

order broke, Al-Yamani first 
received a text from a friend back 
home who wondered if Al-Yamani 
would be able to return to Japan 
under the new policy. Al-Yamani 
was shocked. He read the news 
of the order and then continued 
following cases of people being 
detained or deported over the 
weekend.

“And then,” he said, “I was just 

like, ‘Wow, this is real.’ ”

we want to hear from you. Lourim

Michigan tops Spartans despite early deficit

EAST LANSING — Following 

the 149-pound bout, things looked 
bleak for the No. 10 Michigan 
wrestling team. 

Redshirt 
sophomore 
Malik 

Amine had raced out to an early 
7-2 lead, but was unable to hold 
on as Michigan State’s Nick 
Trimble stormed back to earn 
a 13-8 victory. The Wolverines 
trailed 9-4 at that point and 
were in danger of taking their 
second-straight loss to an in-state 
foe following a loss to Central 
Michigan last Thursday.

But senior Brian Murphy put 

the Wolverines (4-4 Big Ten, 8-5 
overall) back on track by earning 
two third-frame takedowns to 
ensure a 5-1 triumph over Austin 
Thompson in the 157-pound weight 
class. Redshirt freshmen Logan 
Massa and Myles Amine followed 
up Murphy’s performance with 
technical falls to springboard 
Michigan to a 24-9 lead. The score 
could have been more lopsided 

had redshirt junior Ayoola Olapo’s 
injury not forced the Wolverines 
to forfeit the heavyweight match, 
giving the Spartans (1-7, 4-10) the 
final six points of the meet.

“We mentioned briefly after we 

got back from Central Michigan, 
‘Don’t forget how we felt when we 
got back,’ ” said 
Michigan coach 
Joe McFarland. 
“We had to make 
sure 
that 
we 

wrestled better 
today, and I think 
for the most part 
we did.”

Massa scored 

early and often 
in the 165-pound 
bout, nabbing six 
takedowns in the 
first period to take a 12-5 advantage. 
He added four more takedowns in 
the next two stanzas en route to his 
23-8 win over former high-school 
teammate Drew Hughes, putting 
Michigan ahead for good. Massa’s 
individual record this season is 
now 23-1.

Amine also had a stellar bout, 

earning five takedowns and 3:28 of 
riding time in the first two periods, 
which gave him a 13-3 lead. But 
Amine was most dominant in the 
third period, as he used a double-
leg and a near fall to secure the 21-5 
technical-fall victory.

“We’ve 
talked 

a lot about bonus 
points,” McFarland 
said. 
“If 
you’re 

working 
towards 

bonus 
points, 

that 
means 

you’re 
wrestling 

aggressively 
and 

you’re 
working 

hard.”

Yet 
the 
most 

surprising 
result 

of the day was that 

of redshirt junior Ernest Battaglia 
in the 184-pound bout. In his first 
start since defaulting out of a match 
against Illinois on Jan. 20, Battaglia 
netted three takedowns, eight back 
points and 2:05 of riding time en 
route to a 16-5 major-decision win.

“Bouncing back with this win, 

especially 
against 
an 
in-state 

rival, it’s always nice,” Battaglia 
said. “You just sometimes have to 
weather the storm and stay solid.”

Redshirt 
freshman 
Jackson 

Stiggow sealed the dual meet for 
the Wolverines with a 7-1 victory 
over the Spartans’ Matt Okaiye. 
Stiggow nearly earned a major-
decision on a potential takedown 
near the end of the third period but 
did not receive the call from the 
official.

The middle and heavyweights 

were not the only ones who found 
success 
against 
the 
Spartans, 

though.

Redshirt 
freshman 
Stevan 

Micic dominated his match at 133 
pounds, as he cruised to a 10-2 
major decision win over Javier 
Garcia. Micic outscored Garcia 6-0 
in the third period thanks to 2:06 of 
riding time, two stalling points and 
a single-leg takedown.

With 
Sunday’s 
triumph, 

Michigan has now won its last 
seven dual meets against Michigan 
State and is 69-35-3 in the all-time 
series.

“You just 

sometimes have 
to weather the 

storm”

‘M’ falls to Ducks 

Coming into its first game of 

the 2017 season, the Michigan 
women’s lacrosse team was full 
of excitement.

For the first time in program 

history, the Wolverines have a 
senior class that will don the 
maize and blue. The women’s 
lacrosse team kicked off its 
inaugural varsity season with an 
exclusively freshman roster in 
2014, and those same players are 
now seniors.

“The energy on the team was 

very high,” said Michigan coach 
Jennifer Ulehla. “The girls are 
very excited about the season 
and what can be 
accomplished.”

But 
all 
the 

energy 
in 
the 

world could not 
help 
Michigan 

overcome 
a 

slow 
start 

against 
Oregon 

on 
Saturday, 

ultimately falling, 
11-8. Though the 
Wolverines won 
the draw, 10-1, in the first half, 
it wasn’t enough to contain the 
Ducks’ offensive onslaught in 
Eugene, Ore.

Oregon took an early lead 

three minutes into the game off 
of a free shot from midfielder 
JoJo Hesketh. Two more Ducks 
would find the back of the net 
over the next eight minutes to 
surge to a 3-0 lead.

But with 16:30 remaining in 

the first half, one of Michigan’s 
seniors stepped up to put the team 
on the scoreboard. Midfielder 
Anna Schueler — a two-time 
team captain and leader of the 
program — scored an unassisted 
goal, breathing some much-
needed life into the Wolverines.

Yet, Michigan was unable 

to capitalize further, and three 
more Oregon goals put the 
deficit at 6-1 with seven minutes 
remaining in the half. 

Finally, 
the 
Wolverines 

mustered up a slight run at the 
end of the half — outscoring 

the Ducks 3-1 with goals from 
freshman 
midfielder 
Molly 

Garrett and senior midfielders 
Kim 
Coughlan 
and 
Lauren 

Oberlander — to build momentum 
going into the second half.

Although 
Michigan 
found 

itself trailing after the first half, 
its success in the draw provided 
some consolation.

“We had been practicing the 

draw a lot,” Ulehla said. “But 
Oregon 
showed 
a 
different 

defense and stopped us from 
being as successful as we would 
have liked. We needed to be 
able to capitalize on our success 
better.”

Coming 
into 
the 
second 

half, the Wolverines kept their 

momentum 
up 
from 
the 

end of the first 
half, and just 
1:30 after play 
resumed, senior 
midfielder 
Lauren 
Oberlander 
narrowed 
the 

deficit to just 
two. After six 
minutes of back-

and-forth play, another senior 
— midfielder Kim Coughlan — 
closed the gap to only one goal.

But 7-6 was as close as the 

game would become, as Oregon 
went on a 4-2 run to end the 
game, ultimately securing victory 
for the Ducks. Michigan attacker 
Tess Korten, another senior, 
scored the team’s final two goals.

The Wolverine seniors will 

have to wait another day to win 
their first game in their final 
season, but Ulehla is excited 
about the future after their 
performance Saturday. She is 
hopeful that the Wolverines will 
win their first ever Big Ten game 
this season, and with a roster full 
of seniors, this will be the year to 
do it.

“The team as a whole stood 

out today,” Ulehla said. “I’m 
disappointed about this result. A 
few things here and there could 
have changed the outcome, but 
there is lots to be optimistic 
about.”

After trailing the entire game, Wolverines eke out victory

Nicole Munger was the fourth 

option. 

The final play was meant for 

sophomore center Hallie Thome. 
If the ball wasn’t going to her, 
junior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
was supposed to receive, and after 
Flaherty, freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick. 

But 
Munger, 
a 
sophomore 

guard, had the best matchup of 
the five Wolverines on the court. 
Flaherty knew that if she couldn’t 
make it, Munger was going to be 
the kickback. With 20 seconds to 
go, Munger scored the winning 
basket on a baseline layup. 

“We got (Flaherty) coming off 

like we wanted,” Munger said. “I 
hesitated on the 3-pointer, but then 
I just drove, and I got a step, and it 
went in.

“That was just one play. Our 

team grinded out for a full 40 
minutes. We were a little rickety 
in the first half, but we were able 
to come back and fight. What we 
did in that second half is just a 
testament to our team and our hard 
work.” 

Hosting Iowa (5-5 Big Ten, 

14-9 overall) for the first time this 
season, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team prevailed in its 
closest final minute the team has 
seen this season. The Wolverines 
have gone undefeated on their 
home court and have won 19 of 24 
games this season — the best mark 
in program history — and won 
eight of their first 10 Big Ten games. 
Contributing to the great game 
was Thompson, as she became the 
second player in program history 
to reach 500 career assists. 

But for the first time this season, 

Michigan ended its first quarter 
at Crisler Center trailing. The 
Wolverines were down 20-15 and 
trailed the Hawkeyes until the 
final minutes of the game when 
they pulled away to notch a 72-70 
victory. 

“I think Iowa’s a very good 

team,” 
Thome 
said. 
“They’re 

scrappy.They would do anything 
to get the ball. So 
at the end of the 
day we just had 
to make sure we 
were on point.”

In 
the 
first 

period, 
though, 

things 
looked 

bleak. 
Thome 

had almost half of 
the Wolverines’ 
points, but they 
were unable to 
defend against the Hawkeyes. 

The second period didn’t bode 

well for Michigan, either. In the 
first minute the Wolverines let up 
seven points, led mostly by Iowa 
guard Tania Davis. 

In response, Michigan coach 

Kim Barnes Arico called the team’s 
first timeout with 8:50 left in the 
second, when the game stood at 

27-15. 

With less than 

five minutes to go 
in the first half, 
Munger 
brought 

the Wolverines out 
of their 10-point 
deficit.

“I 
thought 

(Munger) 
was 

outstanding,” 
Barnes Arico said. 
“She 
played 
the 

front of the press, her length is 
great. She disrupts everything. Her 
ability to get the ball and shoot the 
ball is tremendous. She’s just active 
and was all over the place, she was 
a spark for us tonight.” 

Added Gondrezick: “(Munger) 

was very important. She’s as 
important as one of our starting 
five. The way that she was able to 
come in and create 
a spark off the 
bench, it shows our 
versatility.” 

But 
the 

Hawkeyes 
responded with a 
pair of baskets and 
the 
Wolverines 

found 
themselves 

facing a 10-point 
gap 
once 
again, 

eventually ending 
the half down, 45-33. 

“(In the Iowa game last year 

at home) we were down 17 at 
half and we came back and 
won,” Munger said. “So this 
year we were like, ‘Well, we did 
it last year and we’re only down 

12 this year so we know we can 
do it, we just have to stick to 
our morals.’ There’s no 12-point 

shot so we’re 
going to need to 
defend.” 

The 
first 

minute 
of 
the 

second 
half 

was 
almost 

a 
complete 

turnaround 
for 

the Wolverines, 
though. Flaherty, 
Gondrezick and 
Dunston 
each 

managed a layup apiece to make 
the game 45-39. 

The Wolverines entered the final 

quarter trailing 61-52, but Munger 
sunk a three in the first minute. 
With two seconds left on the shot 
clock, Thome then converted a 

layup before Michigan forced a stop 
on the next possession. Gondrezick 
got the ball and brought it down 
court for a layup to cut Iowa’s lead 
to two. 

Another 
missed 
layup 
by 

Iowa’s Gustafson had the crowd 
on its feet. And an added free 
throw 
by 
Gondrezick 
made 

the game 60-61 and created a 
deafening Crisler Center crowd. 
Iowa quickly called a time out, 
sensing the game slipping from 
its grasp. 

With 3:54 left on the clock, 

the Wolverines looked at a 61-66 
deficit after Gustafson hit a layup. 
But Gondrezick swooped in and 
brought Michigan back in the game 
with a 3-pointer, which was quickly 
followed by an Iowa turnover. 
The turnover ended in an injury 
substitution, though, when Davis 
finished sprawled on the paint and 
had to leave the court. 

Iowa guard Kathleen Doyle 

fouled out of the game, leaving 
Gondrezick with a chance to 
make a quick free throw to once 
again put the Wolverines within 
three points. Gondrezick then 
successfully made a pair of free 
throws, pushing the Wolverines 
within one point for just the second 
time of the game. 

Flaherty then hit a layup with 

45 seconds to go after Gondrezick 
forced 
a 
turnover, 
but 
Iowa 

responded with a quick basket, 
making the score 70-69. There 
were 35 seconds to go. 

The rest was a nail-biting 

back-and-forth struggle between 
the Wolverines and Hawkeyes, 
but after Munger’s layup, Iowa 
couldn’t capitalize within the 
time-pressure 
and 
Michigan 

maintained its undefeated streak 
at home. 

“This was a special game,” 

Munger said. “We couldn’t really 
get our mojo going in the first half 
just with our offense, but I think 
that makes this game almost 
sweeter. We were able to fight 
through that.” 

‘M’ pulls away late

With only one minute left on 

the clock in the fourth quarter, the 
Michigan women’s basketball team 
(8-2 Big Ten, 19-5 overall) trailed 
Iowa, 68-65. The Wolverines 
hadn’t lead since the end of the first 
quarter, and had gone down by as 
much as 15 points over the course 
of the game.

But the energy in Crisler Center 

was pulsing, and the crowd was 
deafening. As freshman guard 
Kysre Gondrezick stepped up to 
the free-throw line, she felt the 
pressure of the intense game and 
the chance to redeem herself 
after missing three of her last six 
attempts at the line.

This time, she sunk both tries.
“I said, ‘If I miss another free 

throw’ ... I told (senior guard Siera 
Thompson) ‘If I get the ball, come 
get it from me,’ ” Gondrezick said. 
“I think we just had a tough day 
at the line, but we were able to 
convert when it mattered.”

The score was now 68-67, and 

Michigan was close to solidifying 
what once seemed an unlikely 
victory. But 58 seconds remained, 
and coming within one point of a 
victory was not enough.

Seconds 
later, 
Gondrezick 

snagged a poorly-handled Iowa 
ball and bolted down the court, 
passing it forward to an open 
Katelynn Flaherty. The junior 
guard finished the layup at the 
47-second mark. The Wolverines 
led for the first time in over 30 
minutes, but their lead was still 
tremulous.

The 
Hawkeyes 
(5-5, 
14-9) 

were not done battling. Iowa 
passed around the offensive zone, 
carefully setting up a 3-point 
attempt that just missed. But it 
still managed a hard-fought layup, 
swinging the lead back in favor of 
the Hawkeyes.

With just 35 seconds left on the 

clock, the Wolverines needed to 
overcome their scoring struggles 
— they scored just 44.1 percent 
from the floor all game — to keep 
their home record immaculate. A 
timeout was called, and Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico gave her 
team a play to run — but things 

turned out differently on the court.

“We 
would 
have 
had 

(sophomore 
forward 
Hallie 

Thome shoot) first, Katelynn 
second, Kysre third,” Barnes Arico 
said. “So (sophomore guard Nicole 
Munger) was actually a screener 
in that play. But she had the best 
matchup.”

Munger cut to the outside from 

beyond the 3-point line, got her 
shoulder in front of the defender 
and drove down the baseline, 
burying a layup.

“That was just the move that she 

made to the basket,” Gondrezick 
said. “It’s a move that she makes in 
practice every day, and it showed 
in the game. So we trusted her.”

But there were still 20 seconds 

on the clock, and the ball was in 
Iowa’s possession. Once again, 
the Hawkeyes missed a 3-point 
attempt, and there to snatch the 
rebound was Munger, who got 
fouled in the process.

Despite missing her free throw 

attempts, the ball ended up back 
in the Wolverines’ hands, as 
Thompson grabbed the ball off of 
Munger’s second attempt and was 
promptly fouled as well. With just 
six seconds left, she scored one of 
two attempts, earning Michigan’s 
final point for its 72-70 win.

The seconds that remained 

could have been enough time for 
Iowa to sink a 3-pointer, but Barnes 
Arico still had a few tricks left.

“We had so many fouls to give 

that we were trying to foul in the 
back court and stop the play,” 
Barnes Arico said.

The Wolverines gave three of 

their four remaining fouls in the 
last three seconds of the game, 
slowing things down and killing 
off the clock so the Hawkeyes had 
no chance to reclaim the lead. 
As the buzzer sounded, both the 
team and the crowd exploded with 
cheers to celebrate Michigan’s 
comeback victory.

“Last year we didn’t come out on 

the winning side of these games,” 
Barnes Arico said. “We had to go 
all the way down to the wire to get 
our lead and to win the game, and 
I think it took everything we had.”

Added Gondrezick: “That’s our 

motto. By any means, we just have 
to find a way to win.”

Sophomore guard Nicole Munger scored just seven points but managed to save the Wolverines from suffering their first loss at Crisler Center this season.

“Our team 
grinded out 
for a full 40 
minutes”

“We couldn’t 
really get our 
mojo going in 
the first half”

SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

Nicole Munger scored a layup with 20 seconds remaining to maintain Michigan’s undefeated home record

Michigan starts year with same expectations

The 2016 season was the one 

that got away for the Michigan 
softball team.

The Wolverines had all the 

ingredients for success: They 
were 
the 
top-scoring 
team 

in the country, had a strong 
defensive unit, went 21-2 in 
conference play and won their 
ninth-straight Big Ten title. 
But, once again, the coveted 
Women’s College World Series 
title eluded them, after they 
were eliminated by Florida 
State to cap off a disappointing 
performance in Oklahoma City. 

Part of what made Michigan’s 

WCWS 
performance 
so 

heartbreaking was that the team’s 
seniors went to three WCWS in 
their four years but never took 
home a championship win. Four 
of those seniors were core players, 
including 2016 National Player 
of the Year Sierra Romero. As a 
four-year starter, she posted a 
batting average of at least .450 for 
three straight years and cemented 
her place as one of the greatest 
collegiate softball players of all 

time.

But the Romero-era is over, 

and for Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins, it’s far in the past.

“It’s a huge loss, but I got over it, 

like, in September,” Hutchins said. 
“That’s Team 39. My only focus is 
on Team 40.”

Hutchins 
— 
the 
NCAA’s 

winningest softball coach — will 
begin her 33rd season at the helm 
of the Michigan program, but she 
has the same expectations and 
goals that she has every year: to be 
Big Ten Champions and to reach 
the World Series.

But a 10th-straight Big Ten title 

and a WCWS berth isn’t a certainty 
for No. 6 Michigan. With the loss 
of six seniors, the Wolverines are 
younger than they have been in 
recent years. Michigan has less 
star power to bail them out, so a 
balanced lineup will be crucial this 
season. 

While the infield is mostly 

unchanged from last year, the 
outfield will be almost completely 
new, as senior outfielder Kelly 
Christner is the lone returner. 
This opening will allow some of 
the four freshmen Wolverines 
to see playing time, a unique 

responsibility 
for 
such 
a 

historically impressive team. 

“You really want your freshmen 

to come in and not be freshmen,” 
Hutchins said. “The game doesn’t 
know if you’re a freshman or a 
senior.”

To ensure that the freshmen 

play with the confidence and 
strength that Hutchins looks 
for, strong senior leadership and 
support from Michigan’s four 
seniors will be imperative. 

Christner, senior right-hander 

Megan Betsa, and senior infielders 
Abby 
Ramirez 
and 
Lindsay 

Montemarano are poised to step 
into those familiar roles. 

“We all got a lot of playing 

time freshman year,” Christner 
said. “Looking up to the seniors 
and upperclassmen, that really 
showed us how to lead a team and 
how to be a voice on and off the 
field.”

While Christner was a captain 

last season, Betsa has mentored 
junior right-hander Tera Blanco 
and sophomore right-hander Leah 
Crockett while she took the fall off 
with an injury.

With an influx of youth and 

strong 
returning 
talent, 
the 

Wolverines have all the pieces 
to succeed in both the regular 
and postseason. However, there 
are 
still 
lingering 
questions 

determining the future of the 
season. 

A huge question mark for 

the Wolverines will be whether 
Christner can return to her form 
from two seasons ago, which saw 
her hit 21 home runs. Another 
question is whether Betsa will 
return to her top-notch pitching 
form coming off her injury. Yet 
another is whether Blanco will 
demonstrate 
prowess 
on 
the 

mound as well as the plate, after 
starting just five games as pitcher 
last season. 

Michigan will begin its season 

in Florida for the Wilson-Demarini 
Tournament in the first of five 
non-conference tournaments the 
Wolverines will participate in. 
Michigan will take on teams such 
as No. 4 Florida, No. 3 Florida 
State and No. 8 UCLA to begin 
their journey back to the top of the 
collegiate softball landscape.

“We’ll see how well Team 

40 does as we go through this 
journey,” Hutchins said. “But 
we’re excited to get started.”

The Michigan softball team fell short of its expectations during the 2016 season, but could still make a push for the Women’s College World Series.

Wins or not, Yost Ice Arena remains the same

They come to Yost Ice Arena 

every 
week. 
Some 
for 
five 

years, some for 10, and for John 
Sterbenz and Craig Kuras, 24. 
There’s a mayor — Tony Corey, a 
season ticket holder since 2004. 
You can’t forget the children, 
either — not literal adolescents, 
but the Michigan hockey team’s 
famous student section, “The 
Children of Yost.”

They came this past Friday 

night, when they watched the 
Michigan hockey team cling 
to a slim lead and upset No. 11 
Ohio State. They returned on 
Saturday, and saw the Buckeyes 
climb back from a two-goal 
deficit to win, 6-5.

The 
weekend 
serves 
as 

a 
microcosm 
of 
Michigan’s 

inconsistency this season.

After one of the Wolverines’ 

best years in recent memory, 
many expected regression in 
2016.

“I had very low, expectations 

for on-ice performance, or the 
record,” said Ed, a fan from 
Newport, Mich. “I was hoping 
to see some improvement over 
the course of the year. I wasn’t 
expecting an NCAA berth or 
an NCAA championship, not 
with all that we lost. Few major 
scorers came back.”

Added 
Travis 
Smith, 
a 

senior engineering major: “We 
understand 
that 
we’re 
not 

gonna be great every year, we’re 
not like the Alabama football 
team.”

But some fans still held high 

hopes before the season began.

“You expect them to compete 

every year for at least a Big Ten 
title,” 
Sterbenz 
said 
Friday 

night. “In the past, you would 
lose guys and that didn’t seem 
to matter. There was always 
enough firepower in the arsenal 
to replace those people. Over the 
past 3-4 years, there’s still the 
firepower there, but it doesn’t 
seem to be quite as potent as it 

used to be.”

For “The Children of Yost,” 

those 
overhauls 
certainly 

have led to a different feel to 
it than last season’s Big Ten 
Tournament 
championship 

team.

“People come to every game 

no matter what,” said LSA 
senior Barry Snyder. “The big 
difference you see is with the 
other people. You have the 
multiple sections, they’re always 
full, but it’s a matter of timing. 
Especially last year, they were 
packed 30-40 minutes before 
the game started. In previous 
years, it was a little slower, and 
this year it’s been a little slower. 
But the rivalry games have been 
filled up like this (on Saturday 
night). Last night there was a 
line outside before the doors 
even opened. I think the fans are 
still into it.”

As for long-time season ticket 

holders, the biggest difference 
— whether in terms of energy 
or atmosphere — has nothing 

to do with the Wolverines’ 
performance. Instead, it comes 
from the recent renovation of 
the arena. The remodel shrunk 
the 
student 
section, 
which 

originally streched from red line 
to red line.

While few of the current 

students 
have 
had 
an 

opportunity to sit in the old 
environment, 
many 
of 
the 

longtime fans have recognized 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
smaller 

section.

Corey — the Twitter famous 

“Mayor of Yost — believes he has 
missed just a handful of games 
in the last 13 years. He believes 
that the Yost renovations have 
changed how the students and 
players interact.

“Ever since they redid the 

arena, they moved the students 
away from the glass in the student 
section,” Corey said on Saturday. 
“And I think that’s made a big 
difference. The students aren’t 
right on the glass, right on the 
ice. It’s a shame, because that’s 

really what made Yost what it 
was. I feel like since they added 
the corner, the students just 
aren’t in the players’ faces. It 
separated the team from the ice 
and the students. It’s not as loud 
as it used to be, I think that’s 
partially because when I was a 
student, this whole side was all 
students.”

According to the leaders 

of “The Children of Yost,” 
however, the energy hasn’t gone 
anywhere — there just might be 
fewer fans.

“Obviously the offense isn’t 

scoring as much, so we’re not 
screaming after goals as much,” 
said 
LSA 
fifth-year 
senior 

Melanie Lowry. “But the energy 
is still there. We want the team 
to know that we’re still there 
for them. We can be down by 
five, and we’re still going to be 
yelling.”

Added Snyder: “When you’re 

playing better, it’s not just the 
students who are getting into 
it, but it’s the non-students, the 
people sitting on the other side 
of the arena, they’re getting into 
it. Students are there, they’re 
gonna be there no matter what. 
We can’t control what the non-
students do, we do our part to be 
there. We only have four years.”

So while Michigan ended 

the weekend on a sour note, 
“The Children of Yost” refuse 
to be discouraged. They’ll be 
back next Friday in Detroit at 
Joe Louis Arena. Sterbenz and 
Kuras will be there too, and of 
course, so will “The Mayor of 
Yost.”

“We 
pride 
ourselves 
on 

being the best Michigan sports 
environment, winning or losing,” 
Snyder said. “I think there’s a lot 
of people that come to one game 
and keep coming back.”

It was the case for Sterbenz, 

who attended his first game 
after hearing about it from 
friends at work. Just as it was 
for Smith, who went to a game 
his freshman year and has 
continued to follow collegiate 
and NCAA hockey.

And this season is the perfect 

indication — it’s been the case for 
nearly fan that walks through 
the doors of Yost. 

Rebounding, foul trouble plague ‘M’ against Buckeyes

Derrick Walton Jr. pulled 

up for a fadeaway jumper from 
the baseline. There were 15.3 
seconds left, and Walton’s shot 
could have have tied the game 
at 68.

Instead, it clanged off the 

rim. For a moment, there was 
still hope, as the Wolverines got 
their fingertips on a potential 
offensive rebound. But when 
Ohio State forward Marc Loving 
snatched the ball out of the air, 
he simultaneously extinguished 
Michigan’s chance of salvaging 
a must-win game on its home 
court.

Sophomore forward Moritz 

Wagner was forced to foul 
Loving to extend the game, and 
he walked to the bench with 
his fifth and final foul, only 
to watch from the sidelines as 
Loving iced the game with a 
pair of free throws.

That one play told the story of 

the entire game.

All night, the Wolverines’ 

frontcourt found itself in foul 
trouble, and all night, it got 
dominated on the boards as 
a result of it, falling to the 
Buckeyes, 70-66.

“I think we kind of fed off of 

(forward Andre Wesson) there 
and did a great job,” said Ohio 
State coach Thad Matta. “They 
switch a lot, so we had some 
advantages in there size-wise. 
But the guys pursued the ball 
and did a heck of job with that.”

Added 
junior 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman: “I think we weren’t 
putting ourselves in the position 
to get rebounds. Also, I think 
that we were just trying to jump 
instead of boxing people out 
and getting people off the glass, 
and I think that’s essentially 
what hurt us.”

Ohio State finished with a 

staggering 
42-24 
advantage 

on the glass. Sixteen of those 
boards came on the offensive 
end, leading to its whopping 19 

second-chance points.

As Michigan coach John 

Beilein alluded to after the 
game, some of the Buckeyes’ 
rebounds came as a result 
of Michigan’s defense being 
caught in the 
wrong position 
when the first 
shots 
went 

up. 
Others 

boiled 
down 

to 
defensive 

mismatches, 
as 
6-foot-8 

and 
6-foot-

9 
forwards 

Duncan 
Robinson 
and 

Mark 
Donnal 

were forced to compete down 
low 
with 
Loving, 
forward 

Jae’Sean Tate and Ohio State’s 
seven-footer, Trevor Thompson.

But the fact of the matter 

is that Wagner and redshirt 

sophomore forward DJ Wilson 
weren’t 
facing 
that 
same 

disadvantage when they were 
on the floor, but were outplayed 
on the boards anyway. The 
Wolverine duo wasn’t out there 

enough 
either. 

Too often, they 
fell prey to foul 
trouble 
that 

largely stemmed 
from 
situations 

where 
they 

couldn’t 
get 

position battling 
for 
rebounds 

underneath 
and 

were forced to 
commit 
cheap 

fouls.

“Just physically, right now, 

Thompson’s 
probably 
been 

down in that basket his whole 
life,” Beilein said. “Moe hasn’t 
been there very much. That 
was a physical mismatch. And 

Tate has been there three years, 
playing big minutes for three 
years — not a good matchup for 
DJ. He took advantage of those 
situations, and we couldn’t stop 
in those areas.”

Just over a minute into the 

second half, Wagner and Wilson 
both picked up their third fouls. 
Wilson went to the bench 
with just three points and one 
rebound. Wagner didn’t fare 
much better, joining Wilson on 
the sidelines with five points 
and a single rebound as well.

Neither returned until the 

13:04 mark. By that time, 
though, the Wolverines had 
been trying to cope with the 
precarious situation of having 
Donnal and Robinson as the 
sole options in the frontcourt. 
Ohio State held a five-point 
advantage and had led for the 
entire 
frame 
— 
something 

that wouldn’t change despite 

Wagner and Wilson’s presence.

While Wilson upped his point 

total to 11, neither of the two 
fared much better on the glass 
— each finishing with the same 
rebound total they had when 
the second half began. In the 
end, Michigan’s guards shared 
the bulk of the rebounding 
responsibility, as Walton and 
Abdur-Rahkman finished with 
10 and seven, respectively.

The loss stung enough in its 

own right, as it may well prove 
to be the one bad loss that 
the Wolverines couldn’t have 
afforded if they hoped to receive 
a bid to the NCAA Tournament.

But how it happened might 

sting even worse.

“The 
way 
we 
lost,” 

Abdur-Rahkman 
said. 
“Got 

outrebounded, 
especially 
by 

that much, I think that hurts 
more. And it shows that they 
wanted it more.”

opportunity found the stick 

of freshman forward James 
Sanchez, whose goal extended 
the lead to two and chased Ohio 
State goaltender Christian Frey 
from the game.

After Mason Jobst and Max 

Shuart traded goals, leaving 
the score at 5-3, the Buckeyes 
mounted another comeback 
attempt.

A power-play goal from 

forward John Wiitala off a 
feed from Matthew Weis cut 
the deficit to one. Then, nearly 
eight minutes into the third 
period, sophomore defenseman 
Nicholas Boka and forward 
Brendan Warren were each sent 
off for high-sticking. The penal-
ties gave the Buckeyes a 5-on-3 
advantage that Jobst capitalized 
on, scoring his second of the 
night to tie the game at five.

Neither team could muster 

any consistent offense for the 
rest of the period, but with just 
29.5 seconds left, Schilke struck 
yet again for the Buckeyes. 
His goal gave Ohio State a lead 
that it would not relinquish 
this time, stunning the Yost 
Ice Arena crowd and leaving 
Michigan still in search of its 
first sweep of the season.

With just 10 games left in 

the regular season remaining, 
opportunities to move up the 
PairWise Rankings — however 
slim those chances may be — 
are few, and Saturday’s loss just 
may have been the nail in the 
coffin. 

It has not been a banner 

year for the Wolverines. The 
chances of capturing a NCAA 
berth in the regular season are 
slim to none, and with the way 
the team has struggled against 
every conference foe, winning 
the Big Ten Tournament ap-
pears to be a tough task as well.

After tonight’s loss, Slaker 

and Marody were both in-
trospective. Slaker thought 
Michigan made “strides in the 
right direction” when it came 
to establishing consistency on 
a game-to-game basis. Marody 
acknowledged the youth of the 
team and expressed his belief 
that a team has to take a loss — 
or two or three — like Satur-
day’s to “really learn a lesson 
and move forward.”

And while Marody’s senti-

ment is most certainly true, 
there isn’t enough time to 
swallow a loss at the expense of 
learning those lessons. 

it had to change its game 

plan to make up for the deficit it 
then faced.

Michigan began hunting 

shots outside the arc, with 22 
of its 30 field-goal attempts in 
the second half coming from 
deep. The Wolverines hit just 
32 percent of those shots and 27 
percent of all of their second-
half attempts, coming up with 
empty possessions that made 
their job on the defensive end 
much tougher.

“We wanted to drive the 

ball really hard into the paint,” 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
said. “We had a package 
to throw the ball inside to 
(Wagner) as much as we could. 
They took some of that away, 
we didn’t do it sometimes, and 
he was in foul trouble. So we 

couldn’t get enough of the post 
touches as we wanted to get.”

Despite Walton’s heroics 

down the stretch, Michigan 
didn’t get the bounces it needed 
to finish off the Buckeyes in the 
end. The Wolverines’ postsea-
son hopes now lie damaged, as 
the road to a potential NCAA 
Tournament berth becomes 
much harder with just over a 
month left in the Big Ten regu-
lar season.

“Complaining about our cir-

cumstances won’t help,” Walton 
said. “That’s pretty much how 
I look at it as. Circumstances 
are what they are, even though 
you hate that they’re this way. 
Everybody’s got something 
going on at this point of year. 
Nothing’s perfect.

“But if what we’re going 

through at this point spear-
heads a run and us taking the 
next step in some places we 
lagged in, then I’m all for it. I’m 
more so excited. I think it’ll 
make it a better story.”
