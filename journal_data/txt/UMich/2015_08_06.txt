Renovations to 
operating room, 
oncology center 

among improvements 

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

At a media roundtable Mon-

day afternoon, the VA Ann Arbor 
Healthcare System, located on 
Fuller Road, announced ongoing 
improvements to collaborative 
services involving veteran care, 
benefits and services. 

Robert McDivitt, director of 

VA Ann Arbor Healthcare Sys-
tem, spoke about the mutually 
beneficial relationship between 
the VA and University Hospital, 
crediting the University as the 
catalyst for the VA’s inception. 

“There would not be a VA here 

if it wasn’t for our proximity to 
the University of Michigan just 
down the road,” McDivitt said.

The Ann Arbor location has 

been providing health care ser-
vices to veterans since 1953, just 
after WWII when VA Adminis-
trator Omar Bradley discovered a 
document entitled Memorandum 
Number Two in 1948, stating the 
VA would be joining forces with 
the leading medical schools in 
the country.

Four years later, the VA Hos-

pital opened in Ann Arbor with 
a strong affiliation agreement 
with the University.

In addition to an affiliate, the 

VA also serves as a training site 
for the University, with 141 resi-
dent and fellow slots. Every Uni-
versity medical school student is 
required to spend some of their 
rotation at the VA.

Ackerman, Briere, 
Smith and Eaton 

win in City Council 

election

By JACKIE CHARNIGA and 

LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter and

Summer Managing News Editor

Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council 

will include some new faces 
this term, while other familiar 
councilmembers are positioned 
to return.

Zachary 
Ackerman, 
Chip 

Smith, Sabra Briere (D-Ward 
1) and Jack Eaton (D-Ward 4) 
were victorious in Tuesday’s 
primary elections.

Ackerman defeated incum-

bent councilmember Stephen 
Kunselman (D–Ward 3) in a 

tight race, garnering 50.94 per-
cent of the vote.

Kunselman has served as 

the Ward 3 representative for 
three terms. Ackerman, a fifth-
year LSA senior, has lived in 
Ann Arbor since he was eight. 
His campaign was endorsed by 
Mayor Christopher Taylor, who 
enjoyed support from Acker-
man during his campaign for 
mayor last year.

“I’ve done (campaign work) 

professionally for the last few 
years. It’s very different being 
the candidate. Putting yourself 
out there is difficult — but it’s 
incredibly rewarding as well,” 
Ackerman said.

As 
a 
University 
student, 

Ackerman had his own unique 
challenges during the race.

“Students seem to run in 

every election cycle — I had to 
differentiate myself,” Acker-
man said, “I’ve been engaged in 

Council politics since I was 15 
and I wanted to show the vot-
ers my depth of knowledge and 
my real dedication to the com-
munity, and I did so by knock-
ing on every single one of their 
doors twice.”

Ackerman 
said 
being 
on 

Council would allow him to 
break 
political 
barriers 
he 

believes exist in the city’s cur-
rent local government.

“The people deserve not 

gridlock in local government 
but some actual progress in a 
positive direction,” Ackerman 
said.

Councilmember 
Stephen 

Kunselman (D—Ward 3) await-
ed the results with some appre-
hension, pointing to Taylor’s 
endorsement of Ackerman as 
problematic.

“I knew it was going to be 

a tough race, and with Mayor

Ellison Simmons 

works with St. Louis 

artist to promote 
positive message

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

Maryanne Ellison, 1971 Univer-

sity alum and founder of Wildwood 
Press — an art printing company 
based in St. Louis — was combing 
through pictures of protests and 
demonstrations online in Fergu-
son in August as St. Louis County 
braced itself for the grand jury 
decision. That was when Sim-
mons saw the first set of hand 
prints pasted on a boarded-up 
Ferguson business created by 
multimedia artist Damon Davis.

At the time of the grand jury 

decision on the shooting of 
Michael Brown, some insurance 
companies did not cover busi-
nesses damage experiences until 
they boarded up their windows, 
Simmons said. Davis decided to 
post prints of hands onto sev-
eral businesses as a form of soli-
darity with those shops, who 
were already suffering from the 
unrest.

“His intervention, with the 

photographs of the hands, were 
about supporting those business-
es with a mark,” Simmons said. 
“Very similar to the marks on 
doors of those celebrating Pass-
over, so it is a very moving piece.

Two of Simmons’s assistants 

recognized the hand prints, but 
were not able to identify the art-
ist.

“On the street, these crimes 

of shooting of unarmed citizens 
continued, so I looked harder for 
(Davis),” Simmons said.

Davis posted a YouTube video 

explaining his artwork and the 
intention behind it, which Sim-
mons later found, leading her to 
his website, where she left him a 
note.

“(Davis) is a very young, very 

ambitious young man,” Simmons 
said. “I first left a note and my 
web address and, two hours later, 
he called.”

By April 1, Simmons and Davis 

were discussing the future of his 
hand prints, titled “All Hands on 
Deck,” and other projects. Sim-
mons said she was interested in 
meeting with Davis because she 
could see the iconic potential his 
prints could have in the history of 
the events surrounding Ferguson.

“When I have an artist come 

in, I always ask them what their 
dream is,” Simmons said. “With 

(Davis), his seven pairs of hands 
were made for the street, and I 
saw that it was really important 
because the hands would become 
a visual of Ferguson. I think that 
needed to be preserved in an 
archival way, and I could facili-
tate that for him.”

When she and Davis first met, 

Simmons said, he told her he was 
done making the hands.

“I just smiled and explained to 

him that he’s 30 and I’m 65,” she 
said. “To him, since he’s 30 and 
it’s April, November seems like a 
decade ago, but when you’re 65, 
November seems like it was 10 
minutes ago.”

When Simmons asked Davis if 

he had any of the original prints 
he had used to board up Fergu-
son businesses, he explained 
they were quickly painted over 
or removed. He had one board 
left, Simmons said, but that had 
already been shipped off to the 
Smithsonian.

But while original copies of 

Davis’s prints weren’t available 
for Simmons, he had put up his 
hand prints online at allhand-
sondeckproject.org for the public 
to download for free.

“They’ve learned that (the prints) 

have been put up in many places 
across the country and around the 
world,” Simmons said.

Simmons and Davis re-printed 

those images from Davis’s web-
site in order to create an exhibit to 
showcase them at John Burroughs 
School, “one of the most affluent 
private schools in St. Louis County.”

Simmons said the message of 

Davis’ prints are a message of peo-
ple coming together to fix an over-
arching societal problem.

“It’s important to say that when 

anybody looks at those hands, the 
first thing they say is ‘Oh I get it, 
hands up, don’t shoot,’” she said. 
“(Davis’) message was not that. It 
was ‘all hands on deck.’”

The real motivation behind 

Davis’s work is to let individu-
als know minorities alone cannot 
break down years of institutional-
ized racism and inclusion of diverse 
groups, Simmons said.

“It’s a problem that white people 

need to fix and, as hard as that mes-
sage is to hear, it’s absolutely accu-
rate that the dominant majority in 
any culture is responsible for both 
the good things and the bad things 
as long as there’s no joint voice,” she 
said.

Simmons and Davis will con-

tinue to collaborate on future proj-
ects, one of which is a steel tracing 
of Davis’s arms, which are posi-
tioned into a “hands up” position. 
The piece will be on display at the 
Grammy Museum in Los Angeles.

Taylor’s machine behind the 

effort they prevailed. That’s 
what politics is all about,” Kun-
selman said.

While the votes were not in his 

favor, Kunselman found a silver 
lining to his loss.

“You know, when you’re a poli-

tician as long as I’ve been, it feels 
good actually to be free from the 
responsibility, so either way it’s 
been a good run,” Kunselman 
said.

In the race to represent Ward 

5, Chip Smith won by 55.26 per-
cent, 
defeating 
Mike 
Anglin 

(D– Ward 5), who has served on 
Council for the past eight years.

Smith has been an Ann Arbor 

resident for the past 20 years, 
and this was his second cam-
paign. A write-in candidate at 
the 2013 general election, Smith 
declared 13 days before election 
and lost.

“I didn’t knock any doors– just 

ran a social media campaign and 
got 917 votes. I still got throt-
tled pretty good but honestly I 
thought I’d get 100 votes on that 

election,” Smith said. “So to get 
900 was pretty unheard of for a 
write-in candidate.”

Smith said he was proud of 

his campaign, highlighting the 
importance of his focus on main-
taining an inclusive environ-
ment.

“The voters really responded 

to a different approach, which is 
to stress inclusivity– how do we 
build a positive vision together,” 
Smith said.

Yet amid expressions of con-

gratulations, Smith was already 
focused on his next steps.

“I’m really excited to get to 

work now — it’s time to go to 
work.”

Smith, 
an 
urban 
planner 

who has lived in Ann Arbor for 
the last fifteen years, was also 
endorsed by Mayor Christopher 
Taylor.

“I’ve very much enjoyed work-

ing alongside Mike Anglin at 
City Council and I very much 
look forward to working with 
Chip Smith. Chip and I see issues 
very similarly. We focus on basic 
services and real positive steps 
to improve residents’ quality of 
life,” Taylor said.

In the Ward 1 election, City 

Council veteran Sabra Briere (D– 
Ward 1) defeated newcomer Will 
Leaf in the primary with 70.84 
percent of the vote.

A After winning the primary 

election, Briere, who ran as a 
longtime 
community 
member 

and volunteer, expressed grati-
tude for the opportunity to serve 
on council for a sixth term.

Despite the success of the eve-

ning, Briere acknowledged areas 
that were challenging.

“I felt very fortunate with the 

campaign. A lot of support — a lot 
of people greeted me at the door 
saying, ‘Go away. I’ve already 
voted for you,’” Briere said. “ I 
tend to be very pragmatic and 
have this very tiny level of revo-
lutionary, which is fine. I’m an 
incumbent and I’ve had the abil-
ity to move the needle a lot in 
the past almost 8 years. So in a 
way, I bear the burden of all the 
decisions that have been made 
in those 8 years whether I liked 
them or not, and all the decisions 
that didn’t get made whether I 
wanted something to happen or 
not.”

In the race for a spot to rep-

resent Ward 4 on City Coun-
cil, incumbent Jack Eaton won 

over newcomer Jamie Magiera, 
a technology consultant at the 
University, with 60.31 percent of 
the vote.

Eaton said he was thank-

ful Ann Arbor residents chose 
to reelect him to City Council, 
pointing to his history on Coun-
cil as explanation for his re-elec-
tion.

“Obviously I’m really pleased. 

I’m humbled that the voters have 
decided to return me to office,” 
said Eaton. “I mean I did have a 
record and so they look at that 
record and decided that I deserve 
another term. I’m really grateful 
that they have that confidence.”

As for his upcoming plans for 

City Council, Eaton stressed his 
concern for Ann Arbor’s environ-
ment as well as the city’s pedes-
trians.

“We’re trying to fill in some of 

the gaps in our border-to-border 
trail for pedestrians and bicy-
clists,” Eaton said. We’re try-
ing to move forward the Allens’ 
creek greenway. You know, there 
are some environmental things 
that I think that the city has to 
do in conducting its own busi-
ness. I’d like to see solar panels 

on top of our parking structures 
and on top of our buildings.”

Magiera spoke positively of 

his time while running for office, 
saying his experience disproved 
traditional stigmas associated 
with electioneering as a whole.

“It shows that someone can be 

effective in politics without a lot 
of money, with a small group of 
people, and a grassroots move-
ment,” Magiera said.

While the election’s outcome 

was not favorable to Magiera, 
he insisted that changes made 
by the future Council would be 
largely beneficial.

“I’m convinced that this is 

the beginning of something sig-
nificant — not just for myself 
in terms of politics, and getting 
involved in the political arena, 
but I think it’s a new step for Ann 
Arbor,” Magiera said.

Voter turnout in this election 

was 10.46 percent.

The VA Hospital has addition-

al partnerships with the Ross 
Business School and the College 
of Engineering. 

Eric Young, Chief of Staff of 

the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare 
System, said the hospital pro-
vides not only primary and men-
tal health care for veterans, but 
also special care cases. 

“When people are sicker — as 

anywhere else — they tend to 
need specialty care or special-
ized care, and that’s where I 
think we stand out a bit,” Young 
said. “We are really the specialty 
care providers for the region.”

The hospital is currently the 

largest VA hospital in Michigan, 
with 65,000 veterans treated at 
its extended facilities during the 
2014 fiscal year. 

The hospital serves 15 coun-

ties in the state of Michigan 
in addition to various parts of 
Northwest Ohio.

Improvements to the facili-

ties were also made in the form 
of renovations to the hospital’s 
patient centers, such as the 
oncology center and the Hybrid 

Cath Lab and Operating Room 
for the conduction of less-inva-
sive heart surgery.

Refurbishments to the hos-

pital were spearheaded by the 
Planetree program, a nonprofit 
that works with healthcare pro-
viders in an effort to improve the 
way in which care is adminis-
tered. 

New 
decor, 
including 
an 

enhanced color palate, more 
artwork and embellishments to 
patient rooms, serves to make 
the hospital appear more wel-
coming. 

One such upgrade was the ren-

ovation of an operating room to 
include a catheterization labora-
tory. The Hybrid operating room, 
containing diagnosting imaging 
equipment which allows for bet-
ter visualization of the arteries 
of the heart, is the location for an 
innovative surgery. 

This new technique, imple-

mented last year, replaces defec-
tive heart valves without having 
to crack open the chest cavity. 

Performed by University doc-

tors, the procedure involves 
threading a catheter through the 
lower abdomen up to the heart 
valve. Bypassing the aorta, the 
replacement valve is pushed by 

the force of an inflating balloon, 
pushing aside the defective valve 
to swiftly replace it with the 
prosthetic. 

“That’s an example of some-

thing that we offer here that most 
other VA’s don’t have. There’s a 
handful around the country who 
offer this other than us,” Young 
said.

Young shared the impact tech-

nology has had on patient care at 
the VA, including a state-of-the-
art radiation machine. He also 
stressed the impact of telehealth, 
a video-conferencing method of 
patient care utilized to decrease 
travel time for patients. Addi-
tionally, two TrueBeam radiation 
systems were added to the oncol-
ogy wing. At $3 million apiece, 
the machines are an important 
addition to the hospital.

The hospital has a chief oper-

ating budget of $440 million.

Ease of access is a challenge 

for most veterans when apply-
ing for benefits, a problem which 
is being eased by technological 
innovations.

According to McDivitt, over 

89,000 more appointments are

hen I first heard “The 
Monster” 
by 
Eminem 

ft. 
Rihanna, 
I 
wasn’t 

impressed. My per-
sonal music critics 
(read: all three of 
my 
housemates) 

constantly 
con-

demned the entire 
“Marshall Mathers 
LP2”; there was no 
awe-inspiring 
tal-

ent, 
the 
samples 

were awful, the lyr-
ics mediocre. Emi-
nem’s brilliance was 
dwindling.

However, as I began to really listen 

to the lyrics, I couldn’t help but fall in 
love with the song.

It’s no secret that my family is full 

of people with mental health issues 
similar to those that Eminem suffers 
from. My dad and his three siblings all 
have severe anxiety and depression, 
passing along these wonderful traits 
to nearly all of their offspring. Their 
dad, my late grandfather, took several 
medications most of his life for bipo-
lar disorder, a disease that we unfor-
tunately discovered was passed along 
to my youngest brother when he was 
nine years old.

Despite recognizing the plethora 

of mental health problems existing 
within the Marsh DNA, I never quite 
recognized the other anxiety-associ-
ated issues affecting my family until I 
heard Eminem rapping about them on 
the radio.

In the second verse of “The Mon-

ster,” the self-proclaimed Rap God 
admits to experiencing obsessive-
compulsive disorder alongside other 
mental health issues. Other than one 
episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” in which 
Dr. Miranda Bailey is forced to stop 
performing surgery to deal with her 
problematic OCD, it was the first time 
I had actually heard someone in popu-
lar culture talk about experiencing 
obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

While the Detroit-based art-

ist was revealing his problems with 
OCD, the rest of the world seemed to 
remain silent. According to an article 
from Medical Daily, “Because there 
isn’t much public awareness of OCD, 
(it makes) it even harder for people to 
cope and find help for their condition.”

Is OCD another case of don’t ask, 

don’t tell?

According to the National Institute 

of Health, only 2.2 million American 
adults, about 1 percent of the popula-

Yet, a 2014 study found that 94 per-
cent of people experience intrusive, 
unwanted thoughts associated with 
OCD in their daily lives. The disorder 
exists on a spectrum, with most affect-
ed individuals being able to rationally 
cope with their intrusive thoughts.

Unfortunately, the 1 percent of our 

population who have been diagnosed 
OCD suffer from severe symptoms 
that interfere with their lives on a 
daily basis. There are many classifi-
cations of OCD: washers, checkers,

OPINION

As a result of state control 

of DPS as well as Public Act 
362 of 1993, which established 
charter schools in Detroit, 
DPS has become progres-
sively worse from both fiscal 
and enrollment standpoints. 
According to the Title VI com-
plaint, in 1999, when the state 
first took control, DPS had a 
stable budget, a $93 million 
surplus and 173,000 students. 
Currently, DPS has an enroll-
ment of less than 50,000 and a 
budget deficit of approximate-
ly $350 million. The state’s 
use of public funds is highly 
questionable; millions of dol-
lars have been used to reno-
vate buildings that have been 
subsequently 
demolished, 

abandoned or sold at a price 

lower than the cost of repairs. 
In fact, only about half of bond 
money, paid for and approved 
by Detroit citizens, has gone 
to repairing buildings that are 
still in use by DPS. Twenty-
eight buildings had $295.4 mil-
lion invested in them, but are 
now leased to charter schools, 
community organizations and 
Snyder’s new school district, 
the Educational Achievement 
Authority, which he did not 
have the authority nor the leg-
islative permission to create. 
The charter schools that have 
benefitted from state inter-
vention are directly in com-
petition with DPS, and these 
schools have increased enroll-
ment to about 40,000 students. 
From these facts alone, the 

state’s use of DPS bond money 
is, at best, poorly planned and 
wildly ineffective. At worst, it 
is blatantly corrupt and mali-
ciously depriving Detroit stu-
dents of their education. The 
Department of Justice needs 
to carefully examine who has 
benefitted from money spent 
by the state on DPS; clearly the 
main beneficiary was not DPS.

The

“Governor Snyder has usurped 
the authority of the State

Obsessing over OCD

FROM THE DAILY

Money mismanaged
 The state should relinquish control of DPS

T

he state of Michigan took control of Detroit Public Schools in 
1999 through Public Act 10, which replaced the democratically 
elected school board with a CEO whose power encompassed 

that of a school board and a superintendent. This loss of local control 
caused the first decline in DPS enrollment in a decade; for the next 
school year, approximately 5,000 students left the district. Over the 
next 16 years, the state has only ceded control of DPS for approximately 
three years, and DPS is currently controlled by the district’s fourth 
emergency manager, Darnell Earley, who was appointed by Gov. 
Rick Snyder in January. Put simply, DPS has deteriorated under state 
control, and on June 16, the Detroit Board of Education filed a Title VI 
complaint against the governor, asking that the Department of Justice 
look into the misspending of public funds, the violation of special 
education students’ rights and discrimination by the state. Moving 
forward, the state must return control of DPS back to the school board 
and the federal government should act diligently in investigating the 
claims made by the board.

history of the State of Michigan.” This 
degradation of DPS, and thus Detroit 
students’ academics, has come at great 
cost to Detroit. The effects of poor 
education can be seen in Detroit’s 
poverty rates. Of the nation’s 50 larg-
est cities, Detroit has the most chil-
dren living in extreme poverty, with, 
as of 2012, approximately 59 percent 
of Detroit children living in poverty. 
Considering that education is widely 
considered to be a means to escape 
poverty and access a better life, the 
decline of DPS effectively closes this 
door to many children. If the claims 
made by the Detroit Board of Educa-
tion are true, the state of Michigan 
can be blamed for many of the social 
issues, including poverty, that face 
Detroit today.

The low caliber of education and 

high rate of poverty take on a racial 
dimension in Detroit, which has the 
highest concentration of racial minori-
ties of any U.S. city with a population 
of over 100,000. Furthermore, another 
minority population affected by DPS 

is special education students, as DPS 
has the highest population of special 
education students in Michigan. The 
complaint alleges that both groups 
have been discriminated against by 
the state. It accuses the state of cre-
ating “two separate and unequal 
school systems” in Detroit and other 
majority-Black school districts across 
the state. Additionally, it claims that 
special education students have suf-
fered as a result of state control of DPS. 
According to the complaint, teacher 
witnesses and complainants have seen 
ongoing patterns of discrimination 
against special needs children, whose 
needs are not being met and Individu-
alized Education Programs are not 
being followed. These allegations of 
discrimination are serious but war-
ranted, and the Department of Justice 
will hopefully shed light on whether 
these instances of inequality are in fact 
the result of state control of DPS. Until 
such a time, though, it is unthinkable 
to allow DPS to continue to flounder 
under an emergency manager.

E

ver since its creation in 
2009, the for-hire ride ser-
vice, Uber, has faced count-

less criticisms. 
Some regard-
ing the con-
duct of their 
drivers — in 
Dubai, women 
claim one Uber 
driver sexually assaulted them — 
some about the way in which Uber 
treats its drivers — who they con-
sider independent contractors, not 
employees, and thus are ineligible 
to receive benefits. Some criticism 
has come from the community of 
taxicab drivers. But banning ride 
services, such as Uber, is not neces-
sarily the best answer.

These for-hire ride services were 

made possible by technological 
advances, as all rides are request-
ed through an app designed for 
smartphones. Technology will only 
keep advancing, and contemporary 
issues raised by new businesses, 
such as these, will only become 
more prevalent. Rather than trying 
to stop them, we need to create a 
space for these new types of busi-

nesses in our society by working 
them into our laws and regulations 
because they are not going away 
anytime soon.

Despite the problems Uber faces, 

their business model poses inno-
vative solutions to old problems 
that taxicabs could benefit from. 
Before for-hire car services such 
as Uber came along, I rarely used 
taxicabs. They frequently took 
over 30 minutes to arrive and were 
 

very expensive.

However, Uber makes it easy for 

the passenger in a few key ways. 
Typically, I can get an Uber in less 
than 10 minutes, making it infinite-
ly more reliable than a cab. I can 
see where the driver is, what the 
car looks like, the driver’s name, 
what they look like and how other 
riders have rated them in the past. I 
can track where they are, so I don’t 
have to stand outside and wait, and 
there’s always a contact number in 
case I need to communicate with 
them. What’s more, Uber holds 
payment information in an account 
each rider sets up, so riders don’t 
need payment in hand.

Finally, Uber can be much cheap-

ters and arrangers. The thoughts 
are irrational, may be genetic and 
often occur simultaneously with 
other mental health issues, espe-
cially anxiety.

Reading more 

about OCD made 
me realize how 
often I, and sev-
eral 
members 

of 
my 
family, 

perform 
OCD-

like 
behaviors. 

I check to make 
sure 
my 
keys 

are in my pock-
et three times 
before 
shutting 

my car door, I’m super-organized 
at work and am irritated when 
other employees put things in the 
wrong place (it’s not just because 
my boss wants me to be). I can’t 
stand when my housemates use my 
toothpaste because they don’t use 
it the right way.

I asked my bipolar brother if he 

ever experiences similar behaviors; 
his keys have to be a certain way 
in the ignition, he walks around 
the house at night making sure all 
of the doors are locked, his phone 
always goes in a certain pocket.

When I was younger, watching 

my dad perform obsessive-compul-

sive behaviors — such as walking 
down three stairs, back up them 
and then down — I thought he was 
superstitious. Today, I realize these 
behaviors are most likely an effect of 

the anxiety and 
depression he 
suffers from.

Yet, psychol-

ogists 
warn, 

“Just 
because 

you have obses-
sive 
thoughts 

or 
perform 

compulsive 
behaviors does 
NOT mean that 
you have obses-

sive-compulsive disorder.”

So, maybe we’re not technically 

OCD.

Our behaviors don’t necessarily 

disrupt the way we live our lives, 
yet sometimes they’re still prob-
lematic. Listening to Eminem has 
assured me that I am not alone and 
has helped me finally recognize the 
way I do things, and why I do the 
“weird” things that I do. Accep-
tance is always the first step.

Eminem said it best: “I am nuts 

for real, but I’m okay with that.”

It’s Uber complicated

er than a taxicab. A ride from the 
Detroit Metropolitan Airport 
to East Quad in an Amazing 
Blue taxi is $55, compared to an 
Uber ride, which can be as low 
as $28 — depending on the size 
of the vehicle and time of day. 
Uber is also good at responding 
to rider complaints. Once, I was 
charged for a ride I didn’t take. I 
contacted the company, and they 
refunded my money without any 
 

further questioning.

Not only is it easy to get a 

ride with Uber, but there are 
also a few safety measures it has 
implemented. Although there 
have been serious issues with 
drivers themselves, which can-
not be undermined, Uber has 
used its app to try and make 
rides safer. Unlike cabs, Uber 
riders get an invoice for the ride 
sent to their e-mail, including a 
map of their route and who the 
driver was. Should a passenger 
have any problems, they have 
all the information they need. 
Also, before even getting in the 
car, passengers (and drivers) can 
see each other’s overall ratings, 
which places responsibility for 
actions on the drivers and riders. 
According to its website, Uber 
drivers must undergo extensive 
background checks before being 
allowed to drive. If a driver or 
rider is frequently getting nega-
tive feedback from others, they 
will no longer be allowed to use 
Uber. Although safety is still a 
paramount issue, this is a very 
good start.

It’s clear that Uber has a 

model that is widely appealing. 
However, there are certainly 
important problems with the 
company. One of the largest 
issues surrounding Uber, at the 
moment, is the treatment of their 
drivers. According to the compa-
ny’s website, drivers make their 
own schedules, use their own 
cars and don’t report to a boss. 
Thus, drivers are independent 
contractors. By labeling them 
as independent contractors, and 
not as employees, Uber doesn’t 
have to give drivers benefits that 
labor laws guarantee to employ-
ees. One Uber driver had to go to 
court to receive compensation 
for business expenses. In that 
case, the California Labor Com-
missioner’s Office ruled that that 
particular Uber driver was an 
employee, and thus Uber had to 
compensate them. Yet, because 
there’s no uniform classification 
for Uber drivers right now, it’s 
decided on a case-by-case basis 
whether an Uber driver is an 
employee or independent con-
tractor. In each case, the courts 
will have to decide “whether a 
worker is economically depen-
dent on the employer or in busi-
ness for him or herself.” To fairly 
compensate drivers, there must 
be a new category that blends 
the laws and regulations that 
enforce the treatment of tradi-
tional employees and indepen-
dent contractors.

Another concern that many 

have raised with Uber is the ways 
in which it’s affecting taxi ser-
vices. The taxi medallion system, 

created in 1937 to cap the number 
of taxicabs that could circulate 
in New York City, reduced prob-
lems that resulted from too many 
cabs and not enough passengers. 
Today, there’s no cap on Uber and 
other similar for-hire ride servic-
es, and it’s hurting cab drivers that 
would rather drive a taxi because 
they are unionized employees. 
Some also argue that uncapped, 
Uber and other for-hire ride ser-
vices congest traffic, increasing 
environmental 
problems 
and 

slowing economic growth.

The issue of Uber is widely 

complex. Uber has a number 
of great elements that make it 
appealing to riders and, to an 
extent, drivers that we would do 
well to incorporate into our tradi-
tional transportation models. At 
the same time, Uber undoubtedly 
has problems to fix. Uber should 
be forced to comply with regula-
tions providing drivers with what 
they deserve to further ensure 
the wellbeing of riders and driv-
ers and better synchronize Uber 
with taxicab companies. These 
changes only will come when we 
demand new laws be put in place 
to incorporate Uber and other for-
hire ride services, businesses that 
are neither chauffeur or taxi ser-
vices and whose drivers do not fit 
the traditional mold of employees 
or independent contractors. We 
must embrace innovative busi-
nesses, but continue to hold them 
to important labor standards.

Meek Mill & Drake: the 
beef isn’t even a contest 

Meek is just another 
competitor, yelling 

and screaming

By SHAYAN SHAFII

For The Daily

“I Heard once, that they would 

rather hear about memories than 
enemies / Rather hear what was or 
what will be than what is / Rather 
hear how you got it over how much 
it cost you / Rather hear about find-
ing yourself and how you lost you / 
Rather you make this an open letter 
about family and struggle and it tak-
ing forever / About hearts that you 
broken and ties that you severed / 
No doubt in my mind, that’ll make 
‘em feel better”

At the end of “Headlines,” the 

standout single from Drake’s 2011 
album Take Care, Drake recited 
what in hindsight seems like a state-
ment of purpose for his career. A for-
mula for what he believes the people 
need, what they crave, what they’ve 
been (were) missing. In a rap game 
that’s been cluttered by artists with 
fantastical delusions of being drug 
kingpins (yes you, Rick Ross), Drake 
had the conviction to believe in 
transparency as the ultimate vehicle 
for expression. Four years removed 
from his speculative claims, it’s safe 
to say he got it right. He knows it 
too; there’s a reason he recently spat 
“Please do not speak to me like I’m 
that Drake from four years ago / I’m 
at a higher place.” 

Thus, it comes as a surprise that 

Drake’s authenticity has come into 

question this week. Meek Mill 
currently holds the number one 
rap album in the country, but only 
with the help of the Drake Stimu-
lus Package™. The Boy’s feature 
on “R.I.C.O.” undoubtedly raised 
the profile of the album, but Meek 
has opted to bite the hand that 
fed him by claiming Drake didn’t 
write the verses for several of his 
recent hits, including the feature 
he paid for.

To say that Meek’s shots are 

poorly aimed would be an under-
statement. Drake responded like a 
seasoned veteran: two songs and 
zero tweets. For someone being 
attacked on the basis of being a fraud, 
he had no qualms stepping into the 
ring while referring to himself as a 
“singin’ nigga” on “Back to Back.” 
Where Drake has shattered miscon-
ceptions of what it means to be a rap-
per, Meek Mill’s entire discography 
could be described as simply “loud”. 

The irony of the whole exchange 

is that Drake is being accused of 
singing another man’s words, but 
it’s actually his shameless transpar-
ency that has led him to become 
the biggest contemporary artist in 
American popular culture. Surely 
a debatable title to bestow upon 
Drizzy Drake: a guy who once reen-
acted and recorded a drunk phone 
call to his ex, denouncing her then 
current partner … and put it on his 
album. Yet, the audacity to say what 
so many are unwilling to is what 
makes him America’s guilty plea-
sure. So many call him soft, but how 
many would stare down the bar-
rel of the media in the way Drake 
approaches his music?

That Drake won the beef before 

it even happened was written all 
over If You’re Reading This It’s 
Too Late. The whole project was 
characterized by an incessant 
paranoia that can come only from 
being at the top: experiencing life 
as a living target (“Energy”), hav-
ing difficulty letting new people in 
(“Legend”), and even the strain on 
his relationship with his mother 
(“You and The 6”). Every one of 
Drake’s moves is scrutinized with 
the utmost attention to detail, but 
no one really cares enough to fact-
check the number of bricks Meek 
Mill claims to move. 

Drake reached this position 

through brutal honesty at his own 
expense, and the consistency of 
his message throughout his vari-
ous phases of life renders Meek 
the loser by default. Faced with 
defending his authenticity, Drake’s 
trump card is that his music is 
inherently an extension of himself. 
He refers to the various women 
in his life by first name on record, 
recalls Toronto streets and neigh-
borhoods that he holds dear, and is 
often the guy that “says it” so you 
can take comfort in not having to. 
On the other hand, Meek Mill’s 
album could have very easily been 
made by plenty of artists, and it 
would have made an equal amount 
of sense coming out of their mouths 
(the entire MMG roster is virtu-
ally interchangeable at this point). 
Meek can yell and scream all he 
wants, as many have done before 
him, but he’s just another com-
petitor trying to drain the reigning 
champ of his energy.

DRAKE

Free Meek Mill

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

For the past three “Mission: 

Impossible” movie releases, there 
have been an assortment of head-
lines that proclaim something like 
“New 
entry 

reinvigorates 
‘Mission: Impos-
sible’ Franchise.” 
However, 
after 

the 
unqualified 

creative and box 
office success of 
“M:I Ghost Pro-
tocol,” the series’s 
new entry, “M:I 
Rogue 
Nation” 

seems less like a 
rejuvenation 
of 

a dormant fran-
chise, and more 
like a showcase for the series’s grow-
ing confidence in its abilities at telling 
enjoyable, globe-spanning espionage 
adventure stories, with enough 
twists to make up for some of the 
drier scenes.

“Rogue Nation” follows what hap-

pens when, after the IMF (the fic-
tional Impossible Missions Force) is 
shut down by the government, forc-
ing Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, coming 
off the great “Edge of Tomorrow”) to 
go underground while attempting 
to take down the mysterious group 
“the syndicate.” Along the way, he 
seeks help from former-IMF friends 
William Brandt (Jeremy Renner, 
“Avengers: Age of Ultron”), Benji 
(Simon Pegg, “The World’s End”) 
and Luther (Ving Rhames, “Monday 
Mornings”) and possible-syndicate-
double-agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca 
Ferguson, “The White Queen”). 

At its core, “Rogue Nation” is a spy 

movie, and it has all the major pieces 
you would expect. It includes gad-
gets, secret 

messages, double crosses and lots 

of covert activity, all of which are 
executed at about the highest pos-
sible level. The story is filled with 
enough enjoyable twists and intrigu-
ing mysteries to keep pushing the 
story forward, even when a couple 
over-long dialogue sequences threat-
en to hold it back. 

Even with the strong plot, “Rogue 

Nation” ’s major successes lie in its 
major action set pieces, which help in 
keeping the movie moving at a brisk 
pace. The most well-known of these 

sequences featuring Hunt hanging 
off the side of an airplane does lose 
some of the shock factor because of 
its presence in pretty much every 
trailer for the movie. However, the 
other major set-pieces are both sur-
prising in the amount of fun they 
have, but also how they use the 
movie’s exotic locations. The movie 
was shot on location in places such as 
Austria, Morocco and London, each 
of which has a corresponding action 
sequence. There’s a scene set in the 
Vienna Opera House which has mul-
tiple fights in and around the rafters 
of the stage which are about as good 
as anything you’ll see at the mov-
ies this year. Director Christopher 
McQuarrie (“Jack Reacher”) frames 
them in a tight, claustrophobic way 
that creates a small feel in the Opera 
House’s huge setting. 

It helps that each of the movie’s 

performers are working at the top of 
their game. A lot of the comic relief 
in this movie is put on the shoulders 
of Pegg, who has proven himself in 
the past as a gifted comic actor. He 
routinely gets laughs, especially 
when he’s shown in his role after 
the shutdown of the IMF. Ferguson 
has a complicated role to play, with 
a character who peels back multiple 
layers as the movie moves on, and 
she does a good job bringing them 
to life.

However, despite the strength of 

the ensemble, this is Cruise’s movie, 
and it’s as strong as it is because of 
his work. 

Despite being 53 years old, he can 

still do the stunt work required of 
a above-the-title star (like hanging 
off the side of an airplane), and he 
has the charisma to play a central 
character in a movie like this. While 
his movies haven’t been as success-
ful recently as the past (“Edge of 
Tomorrow” only made $370 million 
off a $178 million budget), “Rogue 
Nation” shows that he still has the 
same movie-star qualities that made 
him famous.

What all the pieces of “Mission: 

Impossible — Rogue Nation” add 
up to is a film which knows exactly 
how to tell an entertaining espio-
nage story. At this point, the “M:I” 
franchise is starting to become a 
well-oiled machine, and as long as 
they produce movies with this tight 
storytelling and high-quality action 
work, and keep the ensemble togeth-
er, they should make several more.

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer 

Lollapalooza, you truly are a 

dusty, sweaty chaos of a festival. 
For three days you put me through 
my paces — forcing me to prioritize 
which acts I would have to sacrifice 
in order to see my musical idols, 
testing how long it is physically pos-
sible for my body to stand in a crowd 
under the relentless sun, daring me 
to eat far too many $9 lobster corn-
dogs in one day, etc. But, oh, how I 
love you so. You brought together 
my three most cherished past times 
(eating artery-clogging food, listen-
ing to live music and people watch-
ing) and tied them up with a bow 
that was equally appreciative of 
the classics, yet still on the pulse of 
everything up and coming. To echo 
the sentiment I heard so many times 
while leaving Grant Park on Sunday 
evening, I can’t wait ‘til next year. 

What So Not

Walking into the masses for 

the first time to see this EDM duo, 
I honestly did not know what to 
expect. It was my first show of the 
festival and it was taking place 
at the infamously rowdy Perry’s 
stage. Making my way to the front, 
the crowd consisted mainly of my 
peers – young, probably intoxicat-
ed, people looking to have a good 
time. What So Not was addicting, 
working the crowd and exuding the 
energy of a headliner rather than 
someone in their 3:15 time slot. 

Alt-J

Coming from the ready-to-rage 

sound of What So Not to the under-
stated musicality of Alt-J provided a 
stark contrast of experience. Open-
ing with “Hunger of the Pines” and 
“Fitzpleasure,” Alt-J let their music 
speak for itself. Starting off with 
tracks mainly from An Awesome 
Wave then transitioning into their 
more recent material, the band 
catered to old and new fans alike. 
Their show was absent of overly 
stimulating lights or even much 
movement from the band members 
themselves. Wrapping their set 
with “Nara” and “Breezeblocks,” 
Alt-J reminded the crowd where 
they are now and how far they have 
come since they started in 2007, 
making it obvious that they have no 
intention of slowing down. 

Dillon Francis 

Dillon Francis was ridiculous in 

the best way possible. Satisfying 
the fans of Perry’s stage, his set was 
seventy-five minutes of unexpected 
absurdity. Fittingly, his flashing 
backgrounds consisted of emojis 

and a hodgepodge of celebrity faces. 
During one of his many remixes of a 
trap song, Francis shouted, “I’m so 
white!” to which the crowd roared 
in response. The rest of his show 
followed a similar pattern, pull-
ing stunts like urging the crowd 
to chant “fuck!” and bringing out 
Chicago-native Vic Mensa. While 
most of his antics were idiotic, Dil-
lon Francis brought the level of 
hype his millennial followers were 
looking for. 

Paul McCartney

With the longest set and the 

most distinguished musical past of 
any performer at Lollapalooza, do I 
even need to mention how big of a 
deal Paul McCartney is? Probably 
not, it’s Paul fucking McCartney. 
Reflecting on his legacy, McCart-
ney provided a steady flow of songs 
by The Beatles as well as project-
ing pictures on stage of himself and 
others in their youth. The astonish-
ing sea of people gathered to see Sir 
Paul consisted of life-long Beatles 
fans, young music buffs and the 
occasional passerby who wanted 
to witness the legend for just a 
moment. McCartney did not dis-
appoint, playing hits like “Maybe 
I’m Amazed,” “Eleanor Rigby,” 
“Live and Let Die” and “Hey Jude.” 
Reminding the crowd of his ever-
present roots in popular music, 
he even sang a snippet of “FourFi-
veSeconds.” At seventy-three years 
old, McCartney looked and sounded 
amazing, putting on one hell of a 
show and showing the youngsters 
in the lineup how it’s done. 

The Weeknd

Headlining 
opposite 
Paul 

McCartney on Friday night, The 
Weeknd opened with his claim to 
fame, “High For This.” Despite his 
more low-key R&B sound, Abel kept 
the crowd’s energy up, telling them 

things like, “I came all the way from 
Toronto to fuck shit up with you 
tonight.” The set spanned fourteen 
songs, with one encore (despite the 
artists claim that he “never does 
encores at festivals”). Though he 
touched on a variety of material, 
both old and new, The Weeknd’s 
set was a full thirty minutes shorter 
than his allotted performing time. 
Other than the lapse in timekeep-
ing, the performance was absent 
of other shortcomings — Abel’s 
live voice was as good as the studio 
recordings, his stage set-up was sul-
try and dripping in red and, in typi-
cal festival fashion, he performed his 
most popular songs. Paradoxically 
enticing and relaxing, The Weeknd 
was a perfect wrap for day one. 

Tame Impala

I like to think of Tame Impala as the 

present day kings of musical psyche-
delics, and their performance on Sat-
urday fit this bill perfectly. The masses 
that gathered to hear the Aussies were 
the most relaxed I had seen so far, 
with many fans opting to sprawl out 
on the grass rather than stand in the 
crowd. Though brief, my time spent 
engulfed in Tame Impala’s vibrant 
wall of sound was exactly what I think 
experiencing live music should be — 
thought provoking and pure. 

Brand New

In their fifteen-year history as 

a band, Brand New has built up a 
fiercely loyal fan base, a fact that 
was clearly evident when survey-
ing the crowd at their Saturday 
evening show. Opening with their 
newest track, “Mene,” front man 
Jesse Lacey and the band brought 
the same level of emotive energy 
they have been dishing out for over 
a decade. In their twelve song set, 
the band played mainly from The 
Devil and God are Raging Inside 
Me and Deja Entendu. Brand New 

moved from more toned down 
tracks like “Millstone” and “Jesus 
Christ” to hard-hitting favorites 
like “Degausser” and “Sowing Sea-
son (Yeah),” climbing to a crescendo 
as the set wrapped. 

Alesso

The crowd that gathered to see 

the Swedish DJ was one of the most 
homogenous I experienced at Lolla. 
Everyone was young, animated and 
absolutely psyched to be there. Ales-
so, who is only twenty-four himself, 
mirrored this carefree attitude. 
Despite not being super involved in 
the EDM scene myself, I found this 
set to be one of the best of the week-
end. Every song was a success; there 
was never a lull in energy or lapse 
in showmanship. Playing remixes 
of top forty hits, like Maroon 5’s 
“This Summer,” as well as his own 
material, Alesso kept in mind EDM 
experts and rookie-ravers alike. 
There were strobe lights, bursts of 
flames and layers of fog above the 
crowd, leading the eye up to the vis-
ible Chicago skyline. A gold-winged 
Tove Lo even came out to accom-
pany Alesso on their collaboration, 
“Heroes (we could be).” Ending 
with “Under Control,” it was clear 
that this show would be the high 
point of the weekend for much of 
the young mass gathered at Perry’s 
stage that night. 

*Evacuation* 

The only major hiccup of the 

weekend came in the form of some 
severe weather. Mid-day Sunday, 
a storm rolled over Lake Michigan 
and into Grant Park, forcing all Lol-
la-attendees to evacuate the park for 
a short time and for the headliners of 
that night to wrap their shows early. 

Marina and The Diamonds

Sauntering out onto the swelter-

ing Sprint stage on Sunday after-
noon, Marina looked and sounded 
flawless. Sporting a black, plastic 
jumpsuit, neon pink heels and a 
holographic 
headpiece 
reading 

“Froot,” the title of her latest album, 
Marina kicked off the show with 
“Bubblegum Bitch.” Fans wore 
headbands adorned with fruit, drew 
Electra Heart’s signature heart 
on their cheeks and affectionately 
shouted things like “slay bitch!” 
when she walked in their direc-
tion, they adored her. Marina took 
the weather delay and scorching 
post-rain heat in stride, continuing 
to perform despite having almost 
fainted (twice). With an equal mix 
of old and new, the Brit mixed it 
up with hits from each era of her 
career. She even put a new spin on 
some of her classics, inverting gen-

der-specific lyrics on portions of 
both “Primadonna Girl” and “How 
To Be a Heartbreaker.” Though 
shorter than originally intended, 
Marina’s performance was just as 
fans would expect — personable, 
sweet and spunky. 

FKA Twigs

With such delicate vocals and 

intricate instrumentals, I was curi-
ous to see how FKA twigs would 
translate her music into a live 
performance. She did so with an 
extreme attention to detail. Every 
note, tone and lyric was synced 
to the movement of her body and 
the timing of the lights. Writhing 
and slithering, she danced her way 
through each song, managing to 
move about the stage and keep up 
with her vocals. The echoing nature 
of a live performance only amplified 
the already reverberating quality 
of Twig’s voice and I could tell she 
was in her element. The vocals, as 
well as the steady roll of the bass, 
were especially powerful on songs 
like “Glass and Patron.” Her perfor-
mance came across more like a live-
action art exposition rather than a 
concert, setting her apart from all 
other performs I saw. 

Florence and The Machine

It should surprise no one that 

Florence and the Machine abso-
lutely killed it as Sunday night’s 
biggest headliner. Though the set 
was cut short due to another round 
of bad weather, the nine songs that 
she did manage to get through were 
phenomenal. Kicking off the show 
with “What the Water Gave Me” 
and “Ship to Wreck,” Florence made 
it clear that it was going to be a high 
energy, 
passionate 
performance. 

Running about the stage, with her 
signature red locks trailing behind 
her, Florence didn’t miss a beat — her 
vocals remained impeccable. With 
lightening flashing in the sky, Flor-
ence received word that she needed 
to leave the stage, stating “the storm 
had won.” Before doing so, she gave 
the crowd one last song, “Dog Days 
Are Over.” People began slowly 
making their way out, dancing and 
clapping along to the rhythm as the 
night sky continued to cloud over. 
During these last few minutes of her 
performance, Florence urged the 
audience to be free and passionate, 
telling them to remove an article of 
their clothing and wave it above their 
head. Following her own advice, the 
singer removed her blouse and ran 
off stage towards the crowd to make 
her exit. The masses went crazy, 
making it one of the most memora-
ble moments of Lollapalooza by far.

Concussion history 

does not affect 
neurocognitive 
performance 

By CHETALI JAIN

Daily Staff Reporter

Before 
500 
clinicians 
and 

researchers from around the 
world, University students and 
doctors 
presented 
their 
own 

research at the annual Sports 
Concussion Conference, hosted 
by the American Academy of Neu-
rology, in Denver this past July. 
The study, funded by the National 
Collegiate Athletics Association, 
found that gender and concussion 
history does not affect long-term 
neurocognitive performance.

Kathryn O’Connor, a Univer-

sity Ph.D. student studying kine-
siology and lead author of the 
study, said she was interested 
in this specific field of research 
because of her own athletic his-
tory.

“As a former collegiate ice 

hockey player, I am interested 
in how concussion is expressed 
between genders,” O’Connor said.

O’Connor’s 
research 
team 

included Jeffrey Kutcher MD, 
director of the University’s con-
cussion research and care pro-
gram Michigan Neurosport.

“The overall goal is simple: 

to advance clinical care and 
research in the area of sports 
concussion. The best was to do 
this through collaboration across 
disciplines and focusing our col-
lective efforts in a positive, sci-
ence-based way” Kutcher said of 
the conference.

Kutcher’s team studied 148 

University athletes’ neurological 
abilities, including their atten-
tion, working memory speed 
among others.

Harris, women’s soccer eager 
to avenge rough 2014 season

Falling short of 
expectations last 
season, Michigan 
looks to return to 

Elite Eight

By BRAD WHIPPLE 

Daily Sports Writer

Like her performance on the 

soccer field, Corinne Harris has 
kept her summer fast-paced. The 
senior forward began the sum-
mertime as intern on the set of 
ESPN’s Pardon the Interruption 
before moving across the coun-
try to work at Adidas for five 
weeks, 
with 

only a week in 
between to visit 
her family in 
Chicago.

But 
even 

though 
Harris 

had two intern-
ships 
during 

the 
summer, 

her role as cap-
tain 
for 
the 

Michigan women’s soccer team 
has remained constant. After the 
Wolverines’ 2014 campaign came 
to a lackluster conclusion — win-
ning only one of their last six 
games — Harris and three other 
captains are emphasizing the role 
of consistency heading into the 
2015 season.

“The big thing for us is control-

ling what we can control,” Harris 
said. “When we weren’t picked 
for the NCAA Tournament, we 
were like ‘What are ways that we 
could have controlled our fate?’ 
… Everyone can make sure that 
they’re coming in fit and ready to 
play, so that if we’re in a double 
overtime game, people are still 
fresh and we can really make that 
difference and get a win.”

Luckily for Harris, working 

for two companies that revolve 
entirely 
around 
sports 
has 

allowed her to stay physically 
active despite a demanding sum-
mer schedule. During her time at 
Adidas, the interns played 7-on-7 
scrimmage matches two to three 
times a week at a soccer field near 
the office, allowing her to not 
only stay fit but also develop her 
skills against a tougher opponent.

“I got to play with boys, so that 

was very challenging but also 
very helpful for me,” Harris said. 
“It was really helpful with always 
having to be sharp with the speed 
of play, because they were all 
about ten times faster than me.

“I didn’t really have time to 

think too much. You really just 
have to be one step ahead, which 
is something that is obviously 
really helpful to have. … Hope-
fully I’ll see it pay off soon.”

With Harris honing her skills 

over the summer, it could help 
the Wolverines rid the bitter taste 
of last year’s roller-coaster sea-
son. Following the first-round 
loss in the 2014 Big Ten Tourna-
ment that ended Michigan’s sea-

son, the team 
voted 
defend-

er 
Christina 

Ordonez, goal-
keeper Maddie 
Clarfield 
and 

Harris to spend 
their senior year 
as captains — 
replacing 
Jen 

Pace and Chloe 
Sosenko.

From then on, Harris said 

the team rebounded positively, 
allowing the Wolverines to focus 
on laying this year’s foundation 
built around four fundamentals: 
leadership, fitness, work rate and 
accountability.

The captains 

are 
trying 
to 

prove 
that 
a 

hard and con-
sistent 
work 

ethic both on 
the field and in 
the gym means 
anyone 
can 

emerge 
from 

the 
woodwork 

to 
score 
the 

game-winning goal, even the 
youngest and most inexperienced 
of the team. It’s this philosophy 
that head coach Greg Ryan, now 
in his eighth season at Michigan, 
has always built the team around 
during his tenure.

Harris is an example of how 

holding that attitude can pay off, 
when last season, she started all 
20 games, compared to just six in 
the 2013 season, and transformed 
from a player Ryan had previous-
ly doubted to one he considered 

his best.

“(Something that we kinda 

emphasized to everyone) is that 
we want each person to be a 
leader in their own way,” Harris 
said. “Even freshmen coming in, 
everyone has so much to bring, 
everyone can make an impact. 
… We want to have a team that’s 
full of fight and will battle every 
single minute of every game.”

Returning to help wage that 

battle is senior midfielder Chris-
tina Murillo, who spent the last 
year training with Mexico’s 
National Team in preparation 
for the 2015 FIFA Women’s 
World Cup in June. She was not 
only welcomed back to the team 
this season, but was also named 
the fourth captain last week.

The addition of Murillo was 

long planned, given the valu-
able insight she has gained at the 
international level. For Michigan, 
it could pay huge dividends as 
the Wolverines return the core of 
their midfield.

With each captain represent-

ing one of the four positions, the 
leadership is more well-rounded 
in comparison to last year, and 
each player embodies a different 
leadership trait: Murillo’s exper-
tise makes her versatile at any 
position in the field; Ordonez and 
Harris’ verbal leadership could 
lead a more organized effort; 

and 
Clarfield, 

according 
to 

Ryan, feels like 
another 
assis-

tant coach with 
her understand-
ing 
of 
team 

dynamics, mak-
ing her a reliable 
strategist.

But for Mich-

igan to start on a 
higher note than 

it left off at, every practice needs 
to be treated like a high-stakes 
game, one with little margin for 
error, and the Wolverines will 
need only to adjust the elements 
they can manage.

“We’re just trying to set little 

standards (like working hard),” 
Harris said. “So that when it 
comes down to it, we know that 
we’re the most prepared team, 
and we can really go out there and 
control as much as we can to get 
the right outcome.”

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Senior Corinne Harris used two sports internships to grow as a leader and player. 
“The big 

thing for us is 

controlling what 
we can control.”

“We want each 
person to be a 
leader in their 

own way.”

Breaking down the 
men’s soccer roster

LUNA ANNA ARCHEY/Daily

Senior forward and team captain James Murphy will lead the team after a disappointing 2014 season.

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan men’s soccer 

team’s season opener is just 12 
days away, and with the Wolver-
ines’ matchup against Butler on 
the horizon. The Daily takes a 
look at the Michigan’s key return-
ers, 
departures 
and 
arrivals 

before the season.

Returners

The Wolverines will be an 

experienced squad entering the 
2015 season, as 17 players from 
the 2014 campaign are returning 
to form the backbone of Michi-
gan’s 25-man roster. Among that 
experienced group, nine players 
played in over 10 games last sea-
son.

The core of the returning class 

consists of six players: sophomore 
goalkeeper Evan Louro, sopho-
more defender Billy Stevens, 
junior defender Lars Eckenrode, 
senior forward James Murphy, 
senior forward William Mellors-
Blair, and redshirt senior mid-
fielder Colin McAtee.

Individually, Stevens accumu-

lated the most minutes among the 
players in his recruiting class and 
started 17 matches at centerback, 
primarily alongside Eckenrode. 
The chemistry that the duo devel-
oped in 2014 will surely pay divi-
dends as they aim to anchor the 
Wolverines’ defense.

The pair will also receive help 

from Louro in net. Though he 
split time with Adam Grinwis 

during his freshman season, he 
still accumulated eight starts and 
posted a .718 save percentage.

Louro was heralded as the 

No. 10 player in the country by 
TopDrawerSoccer.com in 2014, 
and was invited to participate in 
the United States’ U-20 National 
Team Camp in the same year. 
Given that Grinwis has gradu-
ated, the young goalkeeper will 
likely take over the responsibili-
ties in net and could be the player 
to watch for during Michigan’s 
2015 campaign.

Mellors-Blair, 
Murphy 
and 

McAtee will likely be looked to as 
the source of much-needed offen-
sive production for the upcoming 
season. Though the Wolverines 
averaged a respectable 1.11 goals 
per game, they often couldn’t fin-
ish opportunities in their most 
difficult matchups against teams 
such as Ohio State and Penn 
State, which resulted in frustrat-
ing losses.

Both Murphy and Mellors-

Blair assisted on three goals last 
year — a total good enough to tie 
for the team high in the category 
— while also combining for four 
goals. Mellors-Blair started every 
match for Michigan, while Mur-
phy wasn’t far behind with 15 
starts and 17 games played.

Given the departure of mid-

fielder Tyler Arnone, Murphy 
may be asked to drop into less of 
an attacking role in order to dic-
tate the pace of play and control 
possession in the midfield.

McAtee is the player that the 

Wolverines will expect the most 

production from on the offen-
sive end after he put together an 
exceptional junior season in 2014. 
The forward was named to the 
All-Big Ten First Team — lead-
ing Michigan in goals, points, and 
shots on goal along the way.

McAtee was the first player in 

the program to score eight goals 
in a single season since 2010, and 
he was No. 4 in the Big Ten for the 
respective category. His breakout 
game came against then No. 6 
Notre Dame, a contest in which 
McAtee led the Wolverines to a 
3-2 victory with a hat trick.

Both McAtee and Murphy will 

don the captain armbands for 
Michigan in the upcoming sea-
son.

Departures

Though the Wolverines will 

retain the majority of their roster, 
there are five key departures that 
have left voids to be filled.

Both Arnone and Grinwis 

served 
as 

team captains 
prior to grad-
uating, 
and 

each contrib-
uted 
signifi-

cantly on the 
field.

In his four-

year 
career, 

Grinwis accu-
mulated 
68 

starts 
and 

a 
.741 
save 

percent-
age. 
Despite 

his 
absence, 

Michigan 
should 
feel 

comfortable 
handing 
the 

goalkeeping responsibilities over 
to Louro.

Arnone, however, played a 

specific box-to-box midfield role 
that won’t be filled as easily as 
Grinwis’. Though his senior-year 
statistics weren’t as impressive as 
his teammates’, he still physically 
commanded the speed of play in 
the center of the field, catalyzed 
on the offensive end and was con-
sistent on the defensive end.

He finished No. 4 in minutes 

played, No. 5 in matches started, 
No. 8 in assists and No. 9 in shots 
attempted in Michigan’s program 
history. Now a member of Real 
Monarchs SLC, Arnone also gar-
nered All-Big Ten honors in three 
seasons as a Wolverine.

The Wolverines will also be 

faced with replacing forward 
Ahinga Selemani, who trans-
ferred to the University of Cali-
fornia Santa Barbara following 
his freshman season.

Though the young striker only 

scored three goals, he played in 
every match and was second on 
the team in shots and shots on 
goal.

On the defensive end, Michi-

gan will be losing two steady 
contributors: Ben Manko and 
Nick Lewin. Despite the fact that 
Manko played just nine games in 
2014, he transitioned to the start-
ing left back role for the final five 
matches of the season. Lewin, in 
contrast to Manko, was a consis-
tent contributor — bolstering the 
Wolverine defense with 15 starts 
and 18 games played.

Junior defenders Rylee Woods 

and Andre Morris are two candi-
dates who could vie for the spots 
left open by Manko and Lewin.

The final departure that Mich-

igan must address is that of Mar-

cos Ugarte. The midfielder never 
carved out a distinct starting spot 
for himself, but frequently served 
as a utility midfielder in his two-
year Wolverine career and tallied 
three assists during his senior 
campaign. He played in 15 games 
in both his junior and senior year, 
and his role as a supporting mid-
fielder was more valuable than it 
may have appeared.

Arrivals

Michigan will add an eight-

man recruiting class to their ros-
ter this season, and each player 
of that class will arrive in Ann 
Arbor with impressive accolades 
thus far.

Goalkeeper 
Braden 
Horton 

will arrive to Ann Arbor as a red-
shirt sophomore transfer from 
the University of Pittsburgh. As s 
freshman, he started two of three 
games for the Panthers, but his 
sophomore season was cut short 
after one game due to an injury.

Some of the most highly 

regarded recruits are defend-
ers Johann Bittner and Marcelo 
Borges, as well as midfielder 
Francis Atuahene.

Bittner was named as a First 

Team All-Indiana member in 
2014 and was been a member of 
the Indiana ODP State Team for 
three years, while Borges is cur-
rently a member of the United 
States’ U-18 National Team.

Atuahene is currently ranked 

as the No. 13 player in the country 
by CollegeSoccerNews.com, and 
may transition to fill Selemani’s 
previous role at forward.

The Wolverines will also add 

defender Peter Brown, as well 
as midfielders Ivo Cerda, Ryan 
Kobakof and Robbie Mertz.

Fifth-year midfielder Colin McAtee looks to captain a Michigan offense that averaged just 1.11 goals per game last season.

Interim AD Hackett talks 
student experience at games

By MAX BULTMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

CHICAGO — When Jim Hack-

ett played football at Michigan, he 
remembers looking into the student 
section, wondering what it would be 
like to spend a game day there.

Now, as Michigan’s interim 

athletic director, Hackett is work-
ing to improve the experience for 
those who do.

“I remember going into the sta-

dium and looking over at the stu-
dent section and we used to say, 
‘It would be cool to sit over there 
sometime,’ ” Hackett said Friday 
at Big Ten Media Days. “Because 
what was happening in that corner 
was so lively and 
such at the tex-
ture. And I want 
that back. I want 
that back in a 
way that chang-
es the game.”

Michigan’s 

student section 
will 
be 
sub-

stantially larg-
er this season 
than last, with 
a 54-percent increase of stu-
dent ticket sales. And with the 
increase, Hackett wants to make 
sure the experience grows too. 
He didn’t go into many specifics, 
but rather spoke of it as a general 
goal of his.

One issue he did address was 

stadium internet. He said AT&T 
installed new antennas in the sta-
dium and will continue to work 

toward solving bandwidth issues.

Additionally, he hopes to con-

tinue to foster growth in the 
department through working with 
students. Former athletic director 
Dave 
Brandon 

created student 
committees 
to 

help the Athlet-
ic 
Department 

understand the 
students wants 
and needs.

With 
for-

mer Central Student Government 
president Bobby Dishell now out 
of office, Hackett is working with 
new president Cooper Charlton 
on design thinking, a movement 

aimed at solv-
ing 
problems 

through 
cre-

ation.

“You 
jointly 

solve problems 
by building pro-
totypes of the 
solutions, 
and 

then you edit 
them together,” 
Hackett 
said 

when 
describ-

ing design thinking.

The goal, he said, is work 

together to accomplish goals, rath-
er than being told problems and 
having to figure out ways to solve 
them.

Charlton’s 
instruction 
from 

Hackett was to think about the 
game day experience. And if they 
accomplish their goals, perhaps 
football players will once again 

envy the student section, just like 
Hackett did.

Hackett also spoke about the 

Wolverines’ new deal with Nike 
and what ways he wants to use 

some 
of 
the 

money.

According 

to Hackett, the 
money 
Nike 

gives Michigan 
will be used both 
on athletics and 
at other parts of 

the university. One such area, Rec 
Sports, could see a major boost 
from some of the Nike money.

Currently, students pay fees to 

participate in intramural and club 
sports. But Hackett would like to 
alleviate some of that burden, if 
possible, to make participation 
more accessible.

“(Vice President for Student 

Life) Royster Harper and I want 
to improve diversity in the Rec 
Sports,” Hackett said. “If you can’t 
afford to pay to play, how can we 
help you have the opportunity 
to participate if you come from a 
challenging environment?”

NOTES: Hackett said Friday 

that the Athletic Department’s 
budget deficit, reported at $7.9 
million, will be much less than ini-
tially thought. Brandon’s buyout 
will be lowered now that he has 
accepted the CEO position at Toys 
‘R’ Us, which helped to decrease 
the deficit. Additionally, the sale 
of football tickets fell in this year’s 
revenue, which brought Michigan 
closer to the black.

“What was 
happening in 

that corner was 

so lively.”

“I want that 

back.”

Shannon Scavelli 
named to USA 
Indoor nationals

After an impressive 2014 sea-

son, rising senior forward Shan-
non Scavelli was named to USA 
Field Hockey’s 2015-2016 Nation-
al Indoor Team. Scavelli, who 
achieved career bests in all major 
offensive categories last year, 
scored seven goals and added 
four assists for the Wolverines.

Just the 23rd Michigan player 

to be selected to the USA Indoor 
Field 
Hockey 

National Team 
in 42 seasons 
as a program, 
Scavelli 
made 

the 
cut 
after 

four tryouts and 
beat 
out 
230 

other players.

After 
the 

intense tryouts, 
she 
has 
been 

training 
with 

the team every two weeks in 
Lancaster County, PA. since May.

“Girls from all over the coun-

try are on the team, and it’s been 
a really good experience,” Scav-
elli said. “Having other coaches 
and being exposed to the next 
level of play has been really fun.”

However, the summer train-

ing environment can also be a 
difficult one for Scavelli, mainly 
because the National Team prac-
tices double as tryouts. Team 
members 
are 
competing 
for 

selection to one or both of the 
upcoming international “tours,” 
or tournaments, one in Decem-
ber and one in January.

Scavelli said she is enjoy-

ing her time training with the 
national team, despite the high 
stakes atmosphere, because she 
is gaining valuable techniques 
that will make her a stronger 
player, especially in Ann Arbor 
come fall.

The senior also praised Jun 

Kentwell, the newly-appointed 
Women’s National Indoor Team 
head coach, for her experience 
and skill.

“The coach, Jun Kentwell, she’s 

been really good,” Scavelli said. 

“She definitely knows field hock-
ey and it’s really fun to work with 
her and be in a new environment. 
Having played for Michigan for a 
while, it’s good to go somewhere 
else, get new exposure.”

Kentwell told MGoBlue.com 

she was equally impressed with 
the talent possessed by members 
of her team.

“It was pleasing to see so many 

quality players,” said Kentwell. 
“I am looking forward to work-
ing with this talented group of 

players 
and 

creating a com-
petitive 
envi-

ronment which 
will raise the 
level of every-
one’s game. I 
have 
identi-

fied a couple 
of 
important 

areas 
which 

need develop-
ment, and we 

will work hard to build a struc-
ture to enable us to compete at 
the international level.”

After working at Michigan’s 

field hockey camps earlier this 
summer, Scavelli is now spend-
ing her spare time working at 
several camps in her home state 
of New York.

“I really love sharing the game 

with younger girls and teaching 
them how to play,” Scavelli said, 
adding that learning the game 
can improve girls’ confidence 
levels.

Last season, Scavelli had two 

multi-goal performances in addi-
tion to three consecutive game-
winning goals against Central 
Michigan, Providence and VCU. 
Scavelli is looking to use the 
skills she gains on the National 
Indoor Team to help her lead 
Michigan into a successful sea-
son this upcoming year after fin-
ishing last season with an overall 
record of 13-7.

“It’s great to be able to get 

that training in,” Scavelli said. 
“it’s good to have that and then 
coming back, (with) the skills 
I’ve learned, I can help my team-
mates.”

Michigan coach 
steals show in 
Chicago before 
season begins

By MAX COHEN 

Managing Sports Editor

CHICAGO — Jim Harbaugh 

raised his arms, as if celebrating 
a touchdown, when he headed 
toward the exit of the Hyatt 
Regency McCormick Place on 
Friday evening. He had just 
completed an entire day as the 
center of attention at Big Ten 
Media Days.

Harbaugh’s afternoon press 

scrums consisted of dozens of 
media members, rivaled only 
by those of Ohio State coach 
Urban Meyer, months removed 
from 
winning 
the 
national 

championship. 
Northwestern 

coach 
Pat 
Fitzgerald 
fielded 

two questions about Harbaugh 
in his press conference before 
he was asked about his team’s 
quarterback competition.

And while conference media 

days are often known to be 
haphazard 
affairs, 
Harbaugh 

was in seemingly unchartered 

territory with the interest media 
members took in every facet of his 
life and career.

Throughout the day, Harbaugh 

was asked about events relating to 
the 2000 San Diego Chargers, the 
1986 Michigan Wolverines and 
the 2015 South 
Florida 
Bulls, 

coached by his 
close 
friend 

Willie Taggart.

At one point, 

he even paused, 
for a moment, 
to look up at the 
ceiling 
while 

envisioning 
a 

hypothetical 
Twitter 
conversation 
between 
Bo 

Schembechler and Woody Hayes.

He explained how his Twitter 

account has helped his spelling 
and 
grammar, 
and 
whether 

or not he was able to blend 
in with the crowd during his 
recent vacation to France, even 
during an offseason in which he 
has dominated the discussion 
surrounding college football.

“I 
was 
a 
Frenchman,” 

Harbaugh said.

When 
Harbaugh 
wasn’t 

meeting with the media, other 
Big Ten coaches and players were 
being asked about him in their 

own sessions.

Michigan 
senior 
linebacker 

Joe Bolden estimated that he 
had been asked questions about 
his coach’s personality in 5,000 
different ways, noting that he 
never gets tired of answering 

them.

“I frequently 

wonder 
why 

you 
guys 
are 

so 
obsessed 

with our head 
coach,” Bolden 
said. “And you 
look at the guy 
and he’s very 
interesting. But 
you look at what 
else 
is 
going 

on in the world, and you’ve got 
to think, there’s a lot. I know it’s 
specific to your reporting, (but) 
there’s a lot going on. Why Coach 
Harbaugh? Why not (Texas A&M 
coach Mike Sumlin)? Why not 
Coach Meyer? Why not one of the 
coaches in the Pac 12?

“You guys love it, and I love that 

you guys love it. It’s awesome.”

Last 
season, 
Bolden 
and 

other team leaders frequently 
shouldered 
the 
burden 
and 

pressure from the media and 
fans after losses during the 
Wolverines’ 5-7 season. Now, the 
focus is squarely on Harbaugh, 

even when the players walk 
around campus going about their 
days.

“That’s like the number one 

question,” Ross 
III said. “If they 
find out you play 
for 
football, 

it’s like ‘How’s 
Harbaugh? 
How’s 
Coach 

Harbaugh? How 
is he?’ ”

Two 
tables 

over, a crowd of 
reporters 
had 

already 
begun 

to wait for Harbaugh’s arrival to 
his final media session of the day. 
He answered questions for 36 
minutes, some about this year’s 
Michigan football team, even 
more about himself.

He 
was 
amused 
by 
the 

spectacle at times, reflecting at 
length on his Twitter account 
and expressing surprise that 
the time he removed his shirt 
at Michigan’s satellite camp in 
Alabama was such a big deal.

“Shirts and skins,” he said, 

interrupting a reporter. “It was 
shirts and skins! How does not 
everybody understand that?”

Toward the end of the session, 

Harbaugh’s 
three 
players 
in 

attendance stood up on chairs 
behind the media and asked 
their coach a burning question, 
about who was the best-looking 
player on the team. They laughed, 
disappointed 
by 
Harbaugh’s 

answer that he only finds beauty 
in his wife, Sarah.

Later, 
when 
Harbaugh 

straightened his tie and left his 

seat at the table, Fitzgerald was 
the only remaining coach still 
talking to the media, sitting two 
tables away. He had answered 

questions about 
Harbaugh 
throughout the 
day. From his 
perspective, 
Harbaugh’s 
situation 
is 

ideal. 
Because 

everyone 
asks 

about the coach, 
the players are 
spared difficult 
questions.

“I’d rather have them go to 

class, Snapchat away and play 
ball,” Fitzgerald said. “Have fun, 
it’s college.”

The chairs around Fitzgerald’s 

table were filled, but he did not 
command 
the 
standing-room 

only crowd that Harbaugh did. 
He joked about different ways to 
create Twitter buzz, including 
creating a hashtag that would 
encourage fans to blame him for 
losses.

Harbaugh claims his Twitter 

account consists of his thoughts, 
that nothing has been contrived 
by advisors or for marketing 
purposes, but it has fed the 
attention surrounding him all the 
same. To others in the conference, 
it seems like everything has.

“As a peer and as a colleague, 

I would say I think he’s handled 
it really well,” Fitzgerald said. “I 
think he’s embraced it and had 
fun with it. I think he goes home 
— I’m speaking me, my opinion — 
I think he probably goes home at 
night and laughs his ass off.”

Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh has yet to coach a game at Michigan, but was followed by a media swarm last week.
Harbaugh mania hits peak 

for Big Ten Media Days

ROBERT DUNNE/Daily

Jim Harbaugh will make his Michigan coaching debut against Utah on September 3rd.

“Why Coach 
Harbaugh? 

Why not Coach 

Meyer?”

“I bet he goes 

home and 

laughs his ass 

off.”
