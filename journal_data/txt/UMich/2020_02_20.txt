ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

University 
of 
Michigan 
students are opting to take 
math classes at other schools 
because of the reputation of the 
department’s classes being more 
difficult, students told The Daily.
Students 
interviewed 
by 
The Daily said the University’s 
math classes pose a significant 
challenge and threaten their 
ability to maintain a high grade 
point average. These classes 
generally involve calculus, which 

fulfills many prerequisites for 
majors across all disciplines.
Courses taken at community 
colleges 
can 
be 
transferred 
for credit to fulfill graduation 
requirements 
or 
major 
prerequisites. Students need to 
receive a C or higher in the course 
for the credits to transfer. The 
catch: the grade does not affect 
students’ GPA.
Engineering 
sophomore 
Lauren McNamee, a prospective 
mechanical engineering major, 
opted to take the equivalent of 
Math 215: Multivariable and 

Vector Calculus the summer 
after her freshman year at 
Pennsylvania State University’s 
Abington campus in Abington, 
Pennsylvania. 
Like McNamee, many students 
choose to take classes in the 
spring or summer semesters to 
lessen the course load throughout 
the normal school year.
“I actually took the summer 
class as a way to sort of prove to 
myself that I could do well in a 
calc class if it wasn’t Michigan 
math,” McNamee said. “And I 
actually was able to get an A in 

a summer class when I probably 
would’ve gotten a C+ in Calc III. 
I don’t know for sure, but from 
what I’ve heard, Michigan math 
is just the worst.”
The College of Engineering 
Peer Mentor Program offers 
incoming students resources to 
encourage student involvement 
and development of academic, 
social and personal interests. 
As an Engineering peer mentor, 
McNamee 
helps 
incoming 
College of Engineering students 
transition to college life.

Gerstein apologizes 
for 2017 comments 
involving Israeli-
Palestinian conflict

Multicultural organizations at 
the University of Michigan have 
called for Ben Gerstein, president 
of Central Student Government 
and Public Policy junior, to 
apologize for remarks he made 
in a video and article about 
Palestine while in high school.
The 
video, 
published 
on 
YouTube by the North Town 
News Magazine on May 23, 2017, 
features 
Gerstein 
discussing 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
with host and pro-Israel activist 
Avy Meyers. Gerstein spoke as 
a member of his high school’s 
pro-Israel student group, which 
he said prepares students for the 
anti-Israel activity they will see 
on college campuses.
“There should be a test for 
what type of people deserve a 
state and what type of people 
don’t,” Gerstein said in the clip. 
“I don’t think the Palestinian 
people, with rejecting constant 
peace deals, with their financing 
of their terror, with their raising 

kids to hate people clearly 
because of their religion. I don’t 
think that people deserve a state 
at this point in time. Until we 
see a significant change in the 
Palestinian mentality, until we 
see a significant change in the 
Palestinian leadership, I don’t 
think they deserve a state at this 
point.”
The Arab Student Association 
and Students For Allied Freedom 
and Equality (SAFE) circulated 
a statement on social media late 
Tuesday night demanding public 
apologies from both Gerstein 
and CSG, as well as anti-bias and 
anti-Islamophobia training for 
CSG members. The statement 
said 
the 
community 
needs 
public 
acknowledgment 
and 
administrative action in order to 
heal.
“Ben Gerstein sat across the 
executive board of the Arab 
Student Association and claimed 
that he seeks to build a sense of 
safety on this campus, but how does 
he expect us to feel safe when he 
does not even recognize our people 
as worthy of basic human rights 
and humanity?” the statement read.

The 
Towsley 
Foundation 
hosted a discussion at the 
Ford School of Public Policy 
on “Integrating and Enforcing 
Labor Rights in Trade” with 
Bama 
Athreya, 
a 
visiting 
policy expert at the Weiser 
Diplomacy Center, and Sander 
Levin, 
former 
congressman 
and 
professor 
of 
practice 
at the Public Policy School. 
John Ciorciari, director of the 
International 
Policy 
Center, 
moderated the event. 
The 
event, 
held 
on 
Wednesday afternoon, focused 
on examining the connection 
between labor rights and trade. 
About 
25 
people 
attended, 
including 
students, 
faculty 
and staff. Athreya started the 
discussion by addressing the 
importance of labor movements 
in trade justice.
“This 
concentrated 
power 
that corporations have with 
respect to governance and rules 
really cannot be broken without 
the counterweight of organized 
labor 
movements,” 
Athreya 
said. 

The 
Graduate 
Employees’ 
Organization held a town hall on 
affordable housing and climate 
change in Rackham Graduate School 
to an auditorium full of students and 
GEO members Wednesday evening. 
Rackham student Emily Sheetz 
started the town hall with a quick 
history of GEO. She also highlighted 
the hardworking qualities of GEO’s 
bargaining team.
“We are currently bargaining 
twice a week,” Sheetz said. “The 
bargaining team is in the room for 
four hours at a time, so that’s eight 
hours a week, in the room with HR, 
on top of all of the extra work outside 
of that.” 
Sumeet Patwardhan, bargaining 
committee co-chair of GEO, told 
the Daily that many of their larger 
efforts have been dismissed despite 
their right to bargain.
“They labeled many of the 
proposals, but not all of them 
as 
permissive 
issues,” 
Patwardhan 
said. 
“Which 
means that they deemed these 
issues outside of the contract 
and so because of that, they 
think they don’t have to 
bargain over them.”

6:30 p.m. Wednesday night, 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Law 
students filed into Pizza House, a 
restaurant chain, for an exclusive 
recruiting event for Paul, Weiss, 
Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison 
LLP.
6:51 p.m. A larger group of 
about 15 students walked in 
together, put on name tags and 
were pointed towards a coat 
check.

6:54 p.m. Another group of ten 
students walked in. Handshakes 
commenced 
and 
mingling 
continued.
6:59 p.m. A student within the 
group yelled, “Mic Check.” About 
45 students formed into a circle 
surrounding the sponsored pizza 
and salad in which protesters 
revealed a large sign reading 
“#DropExxon.” 
The protest is part of a 
national campaign to boycott the 
law firm’s recruitment efforts. 
The protest followed in the 

footsteps of Harvard University, 
Yale University and New York 
University law students who hope 
their efforts will pressure Paul, 
Weiss, a renowned international 
law firm, to drop the multinational 
oil 
and 
gas 
corporation, 
ExxonMobil, as one of their 
clients. Paul, Weiss is defending 
ExxonMobil in multiple lawsuits 
around the country that demand 
ExxonMobil be held accountable 
for their detrimental impacts 
on climate change and alleged 
security fraud.

Approximately 
45 
of 
the 
total 60 students present at the 
recruiting event participated in 
the protest. 
The disruption occurred for 
seven minutes and all protesters 
immediately left following the 
protest, leaving approximately 10 
students with the recruiters. 
Protesters at Pizza House 
chanted in unison, “We the 
students of Michigan Law School 
will not work for you, as long 
as you work for ExxonMobil.

When Engineering senior 
Aria Thakore and LSA senior 
Aastha 
Dharia 
roomed 
together as freshmen at the 
University of Michigan, they 
noticed a lot of their peers 
struggled with the transition 
to college, turning to their 
friends or to other students 
for advice.
“We always wanted to be 
that ear for them,” Dharia 
said. “But it was really hard 
to 
sometimes 
have 
those 
conversations without having 
had those experiences.”
As 
the 
year 
went 
on 
and more of their friends 
reached out to them, Thakore 
and Dharia said it became 
increasingly 
difficult 
to 
support their friends while 
also maintaining their own 
well-being. But it wasn’t until 
Thakore 
went 
home 
that 
April that she realized it had 
become too much to manage 
on her own.
“I checked my phone and I 
had nine text messages from 
nine different people, asking 
for peer support,” Thakore 
said. “It was that moment 
where I was like ‘I’m at home, 
I’m walking my dog, I want a 
moment to myself and I can’t 
manage this anymore.’”
From there, Thakore and 
Dharia, 
along 
with 
their 
friends 
from 
high 
school 
LSA senior Sheily Shah and 
Public Health senior Swathi 
Sampath, began working on 
a 
nonprofit 
organization, 
hEARt Listens, to address this 
need. 

“It was really weird to have 
so many people talking about 
the same problem,” Shah said. 
“But it was like a never-ending 
conversation. 
There 
wasn’t 
any solution to it.”
The hEARt Line, which 
officially launched Feb. 10, 
was their solution. The text 
line is open noon to midnight 
every 
day 
of 
the 
week, 
and students can send an 
anonymous text at any time 
and get connected with a 
trained peer supporter within 
48 hours. The process is free 
and open to all University of 
Michigan Ann Arbor campus 
students. 
“We were able to figure 
out that students really like 
turning 
to 
other 
students 
first,” Dharia said. “Students 
also want to be able to help 
other students, but it was 
really hard for them to know 
how to do that while also 
prioritizing their own well-
being.”
Before becoming a peer 
supporter, 
students 
have 
to go through a semester 
of training, which consists 
of weekly sessions focused 
on different skills such as 
motivational 
interviewing, 
navigating 
resistance 
and 
how to tackle difficult issues 
such as sexual assault. The 
founders worked with Social 
Work 
professor 
Lindsay 
Bornheimer to develop this 
training program.
According 
to 
peer 
supporter LSA senior Divya 
Gumudavelly, once students 
text the helpline, they are 
connected 
with 
a 
trained 
peer 
supporter 
who 
feels 
comfortable 
navigating 

the 
particular 
topic 
of 
conversation.
“(Having peer supporters) 
eliminates 
the 
power 
structure that can sometimes 
exist between someone who 
is seeking help and someone 
who is trying to offer help,” 
Gumudavelly 
said. 
“You’re 
talking to somebody who is 
coming from a place that is, 
hopefully, somewhat similar 
to yours because at the end of 
the day, we’re all the same age 
and we’re all students.”
To get a better idea of the 
mental 
health 
climate 
on 
campus, the four founders 
spent nearly a year talking 
to students across campus to 
assess their needs. They found 
many students felt current 
resources were difficult to 
access, and they were not 
aware of all of the possible 
resources available to them. 
“There 
have 
been 
times when it’s been very 
disheartening,” Sampath said. 
“It’s kind of hard to keep going 
through the process hearing 
about how present a lot of the 
issues and challenges that we 
faced or our peers faced really 
(are) on campus.”
The 
founders 
worked 
with 
Christine 
Asidao, 
associate 
director 
of 
community engagement and 
outreach for Counseling and 
Psychological 
Services, 
as 
well as other resources such 
as 
the 
Spectrum 
Center, 
Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 
and Awareness Center and 
Wolverine Wellness to ensure 
hEARt Listens is a known 
and available resource for all 
students. The founders said 
the nonprofit also serves as a 

gateway to other resources on 
campus. 
“We spend workshops just 
talking about other resources 
on campus we can direct 
(students) to,” Gumudavelly 
said. “This is another reason 
I really like hEARt, because 
it’s not trying to reinvent the 
wheel.” 
Public Policy senior Hannah 
Connors 
is 
the 
executive 
director 
of 
Wolverine 
Support Network, a student 
organization 
on 
campus 
focused on creating an inclusive 
community for students. Like 
hEARt Listens, WSN is a peer-
based resource. 
According to Connors, there 
is a lot of research that speaks 
to the effectiveness of peer 
support, especially for young 
people, who tend to go to their 
peers first. WSN offers weekly 
support groups but does not 
currently 
have 
the 
online 
component that the hEARt 
Line provides.
“I think it’s an amazing idea 
because texting is probably 
the least intimidating form 
of communication,” Connors 
said. “I think it’s really going 
to 
benefit 
students 
who 
might 
feel 
too 
intimidated 
to make a counseling center 
appointment.”
Though the idea for hEARt 
Listens started their freshman 
year, now that the four founders 
are seniors, they are working 
on passing the leadership role 
on to younger students.
LSA freshman Nidhi Tigadi 
is one of the students stepping 
up to leadership in hEARt 
Listens.

As a way to convince GEO to 
drop their demands, the University 
of Michigan is refusing to discuss 
further negotiations for salary 
and benefits, Patwardhan said. 
Patwardhan 
called 
the 
tactic 
“bad bargaining” and said the 
University’s 
decision 
will 
not 
distract GEO from issues affecting 
the community as a whole. 
“We 
can’t 
even 
organize 
around and that’s not the kind of 
thing that should be permitted as 
a tactic at the bargaining table,” 
 
Patwardhan told The Daily. “I 
also think our commitment to 
kind of keeping these issues in the 
minds of the broader community 
is a commitment to our members 
democratically 
generating 
our 
platform and telling us that climate 
and housing issues matter to them.”
In a press release regarding GEO 
bargaining last semester, Sascha 
Matish, associate vice provost for 
academic affairs and senior director 
of Academic Human Resources, 
said the University values graduate 
students and is working towards a 
fair agreement.
“We recognize the importance 
of graduate student instructors and 

graduate student staff assistants 
to the academic mission of the 
university and to the academic 
success of our students,” said 
Sascha Matish, associate vice 
provost for academic affairs and 
senior director of Academic Human 
Resources. “We are committed 
to bargaining in good faith with 
GEO to reach a fair agreement that 
serves the interest of all parties.”
 
Sheetz discussed a variety of 
topics GEO was fighting for outside 
of affordable housing and climate 
change, including better wages 
and healthcare for people in the 
LGBTQ+ community. 
“So among the more common 
asks on our platform this year 
are reports asking for a raise that 
attempt to give graduate employees 
enough to close the gap between 
the outrageous cost of living in 
Ann Arbor,” Sheetz said. “We’re 
trying to improve the benefits for 
trans healthcare and disability 
accommodations.” 
Next, the town hall transitioned 
to the topic of affordable housing. 
Over 
the 
last 
few 
decades, 
the 
University 
has 
grown 
exponentially, adding thousands of 
students and faculty. GEO member 
Joseph Valle said the University 

had not adjusted to this growth. 
“Over the past several decades, 
the 
University 
has 
continued 
to grow,” Valle said. “Tens of 
thousands of more students and 
employees … yet the University has 
built a total of a thousand new beds 
on campus in the past thirty years.” 
Valle critiqued the money spent 
on parking units and said one of 
GEO’s demands is to have this 
money spent on housing instead. 
“One of our main demands is 
for the University to compensate 
for the increases in enrollment by 
building 5,000 new on-campus 
housing units in the next five years,” 
Valle said. “We spend millions to 
house cars, I don’t know why they 
can’t do the same for people.” 
GEO Solidarity Chair Amir 
Fleischmann said the housing crisis 
is not only a student body problem 
but a problem for Ann Arbor 
residents. 
“We need a union that covers all 
of Ann Arbor, not just students,” 
Fleischmann said. “If it just covers 
students, we won’t be as affected 
in building power across the 
community. More importantly, if 
it just covers students, it won’t be 
helping those most affected by the 
housing crisis.” 
After the Washtenaw Office 

of Commission and Economic 
Development report found the 
poor state of affordable housing 
in Washtenaw County, Ann Arbor 
Housing set out a plan in 2015 
to create 2,787 new affordable 
housing units by 2035, but they are 
behind on this plan. 
GEO member Noah Weaverdyck 
went over the plan to address 
climate change on campus. This 
would include a plan to transition 
towards 
carbon 
neutrality, 
including no further construction 
or 
investment 
in 
fossil 
fuel 
infrastructure. 
Patwardhan spoke about food 
justice efforts, which included an 
affordable grocery store on campus 
and space for a community garden. 
He also discussed better water 
quality at all three U-M campuses 
as one of GEO’s objectives. 
“We also represent graduate 
students on all three campuses,” 
Patwardhan said. “We want to 
ensure that water quality on each 
of those campuses and all of the 
drinking fountains are tested for 
lead.”

She trained last semester as 
a peer supporter, and is now a 
“trainer-in-training.” 
“I know that not everyone 
has that one person to turn to 
when they’re going through 
a hard time,” Tigadi said. “I 
thought this would be a cool 
thing, to be that person for 
someone else who might need a 
friend to listen to them.”
With the help of the four 
founders, Tigadi is learning 
how to train the next cohort 
of peer supporters, and will 
eventually 
help 
run 
the 
organization after the founders 
graduate.
“I really like what these girls 
are doing,” Tigadi said. “I think 
it’s a very important thing 
that we have on campus, and I 
definitely think it is something 
that should be continued once 
they do graduate, so I would 
love to keep it going.”
Describing the project as a 
constant work in progress, the 
founders urged students trying 
out the hEARt Line to provide 
user feedback that they’ll use to 
improve the resource.

“One of the things that we’re 
really proud of is that it’s for 
students, by students,” Dharia 
said. “We really want to make 
that a central piece of what we 
continue to do as we develop. 
The more that we hear students’ 
voices in it, the more that it is 
going to be a resource that they 
actually feel like meets the 
needs that they’re looking for.”
Through the development 
and launch of hEARt Listens, 
the founders said they hope 
to improve the mental health 
climate 
by 
harnessing 
the 
types of support systems they 
observed 
among 
peers 
on 
campus.
“This campus is filled with 
people 
who 
are 
so 
purely 
dedicated 
to 
helping 
the 
people around them,” Sampath 
said. “That’s something that 
I personally, and all four of 
us, have worked really hard 
to not lose sight of, and to be 
really inspired and encouraged 
by. Hopefully, hEARt is just 
another addition to that same 
mentality that is already here.”

No salary is worth destroying 
our own future. If you want our 
talents, then drop ExxonMobil 
and join us in fighting for a 
livable planet … Employees in 
this room, you are nowhere near 
the responsible corporation you 
make yourself out to be.” 
Protest organizer Max Vogel, 
first-year Law student, shared 
a press release with The Daily, 
which explained the passion 
law students feel to fight against 
environmental offenses.
“Paul, Weiss may say they’re 
just doing their jobs, but a new 
generation of law students — 
faced with a world, quite literally, 
on fire — sees things differently,” 
the press release said. 
ExxonMobil has been a point 
of controversy in the climate 
change movement since 2015 
when the Los Angeles Times and 
Columbia University Graduate 
School of Journalism uncovered 
internal ExxonMobil documents 
proving the company understood 
the environmental impacts of 
climate change since the 1970s. 
While 
ExxonMobil 
privately 
projected 
climate 
change 
impacts, ExxonMobil leadership 
publicly 
launched 
a 
climate 
change denial campaign.
Paul, 
Weiss 
was 
recently 
victorious 
in 
defending 
ExxonMobil in the State of New 
York lawsuit, The People of The 
State of New York v ExxonMobil. 
The 
New 
York 
Attorney 
General 
accused 
ExxonMobil 
of misleading investors about 
the 
negative 
impact 
climate 
change regulation would have 
on the company’s financial assets 
and sought 1.6 billion dollars 
to be returned to ExxonMobil 
shareholders. 
The 
New 
York 
State 
Supreme 
Court 
ruled 
there 
was 
not 
sufficient 
evidence 
of 
ExxonMobil 
misleading 
investors. This was the second 
climate change lawsuit to reach 
trial in the United States, and the 
verdict marked a big win for the 
oil and gas company. 
After the protest at Yale, 
Law.com published a statement 
by Paul, Weiss chairman Brad 
Karp 
that 
said 
Paul, 
Weiss 
stands by their representation of 
ExxonMobil. 
“We 
are 
proud 
of 
the 
outstanding work we do for a 
wide range of commercial and 
pro bono clients in their most 
challenging 
and 
high-profile 
matters, including our recent 
defense of ExxonMobil in a 
securities fraud case in which 
the court found, after trial, that 
plaintiff’s claims were entirely 
without merit,” Karp said. “Paul, 
Weiss is committed to free 
speech and debate, just as we 
are committed to the principle 
that we represent our clients 
and safeguard the rule of law 
zealously and to the best of our 
abilities.”
Vogel 
emphasized 
the 
power that law students have 
in encouraging law firms to 
reconsider 
clientele 
in 
an 
interview with The Daily.
“Law students have a really 
powerful voice in this because 
Paul, Weiss needs us to maintain 
its influence and power as a top 

law firm,” Vogel said. “They spend 
a lot of time and money recruiting 
students like Law students at the 
University of Michigan because 
of how valuable an asset we can 
be which means that if we put 
our foot down, and say we’re not 
willing to work for a firm like this, 
that can have huge ramifications 
for the firm itself and we’re 
willing to use that voice now to 
say that firms like Paul, Weiss 
should reject Exxon’s money.”
Vogel said the firm’s legal 
tactics are particularly unethical, 
as they use their prestige and 
finances to engage in aggressive 
practices to intimidate and stifle 
any suits brought against them. 
The press release mentioned a 
statement made by San Francisco 
City Attorney which referred to 
ExxonMobil’s defense strategies 
as “an outrageous abuse of the 
legal process that seeks to limit 
the ability of law enforcement 
and local government to protect 
their residents.” 
First-year Law student Maiya 
Moncino 
participated 
in 
the 
protest and said Paul, Weiss’ ties 
to ExxonMobil contradicts their 
proclaimed progressive agenda 
and law students should be 
aware of this discrepancy when 
applying to work with them.
“Paul, Weiss’ image is as a 
progressive firm,” Moncino said. 
“They were involved in Brown 
v. Board of Education, and they 
just have a reputation for being 
a good place to work. So part of 
the issue is profiting off of that 
recruitment strategy and then 
taking on clients like ExxonMobil 
just does not fit with that image. 
And we just want people to be 
aware of that as they are making 
their decisions.” 
Moncino 
said 
students 
are taking a stand to remove 
themselves from the narrative 
of 
lawyers 
defending 
multi 
billion dollar companies who she 
believes have unethical agendas. 
According to Moncino, powerful 
law firms like Paul, Weiss should 
reject offers to defend companies 
like Exxon.
“We’re 
not 
trying 
to 
say 
ExxonMobil shouldn’t have a 
lawyer,” Moncino said. “Because 
everyone should have a lawyer. 
But when you bring in a law 
firm like Paul, Weiss, you bring 
in the big guns. You bring real 
power into a courtroom, and 
we just think ExxonMobil does 
not need to have that level of 
aggressive representation when 
what they’re doing is putting our 
climate at risk.”
Paul, 
Weiss 
recruitment 
representatives 
declined 
to 
comment after the protest. 
Vogel said the protest should 
be a message to law firms that 
students will consider firms’ 
ethics and client lists when 
deciding where they will invest 
their talents.
“Law 
students, 
as 
future 
lawyers, are incredibly powerful 
and have the ability to bring in a 
lot of money for a firm or to use 
their choices to make a big impact 
on the world,” Vogel said. “And if 
we encourage more law students 
to really think critically of what 
impact the firms they work for 
have on the world, we think firms 
might think twice before taking 
on a client like ExxonMobil.

McNamee explained that as 
part of her experience as a peer 
mentor, she was not allowed to 
encourage 
incoming 
students 
to take classes outside of the 
University. 
“They do tell us to not tell 
people to take things outside of 
Michigan, and not encourage 
that just because it’s sort of a 
negative outlook on the classes 
here,” McNamee said. “Obviously 
it is challenging, so I think the 
fact that they do accept credits 
from elsewhere is because they 
think it is equivalent.”
Joanna 
Millunchick, 
the 
associate dean for undergraduate 
education in the College of 
Engineering, 
spoke 
to 
The 
Daily about the impact of math 
classes on students’ learning 
experiences. 
“Math 
grades 
are 
pretty 
highly correlated with how well 
you do, at least in engineering,” 
Millunchick said. “I imagine 
that must be true in other fields 
of sciences as well. One of the 
things that I do worry about is 
that we start with the math, and 

it becomes a barrier and students 
kind of lose sight of why it’s 
important. I wish there was a 
way in which we can think about 
how we change that a little bit.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Isabella 
Yockey is studying biomolecular 
sciences and took the equivalent 
of Math 115: Calculus I at 
Washtenaw 
Community 
College in the summer after her 
freshman year.
Yockey took calculus at her 
high school but was required 
to take the class again at the 
University after she did not 
receive enough AP credit. She 
described how the reputation 
of the University’s math classes 
influenced her decision to take 
the class elsewhere.
“I had already taken calculus 
in high school and I just heard 
about how hard it was here, so I 
didn’t want to take it here (and) 
get a bad grade in a class that 
I basically had already taken,” 
Yockey said.
Yockey 
also 
said 
taking 
the class at Washtenaw was 
cheaper than enrolling in the 
course at the University over the 
summer. Additionally, Yockey 
said the calculus difficulty level 
could potentially influence her 

application to graduate schools.
“If I had taken it here, gotten 
a lower grade, it would have 
brought down my transcript, and 
I might not get into med school 
down the line, which is extreme, 
but it all adds up,” Yockey said. “I 
think that I didn’t see the point 
in doing that and risking that. I 
knew the material, I just didn’t 
want to be penalized for any 
group homework or super hard 
exams, even though I obviously 
know the material very well.”
Millunchick said some of 
the changes in the number of 
students taking math classes in 
higher education. Approximately 
40% of students took Math 115 
during their first semester as 
a freshman in 1996, compared 
to 27% in 2018, according to 
Millunchick. 
Comparatively, 
only 6% of students took Math 215 
in 1996 and now 26% of students 
do. Millumchick said she believes 
this change in enrollment is due 
to the prevalence of accelerated 
math programs in high school.
“I just held a town hall 
last week, where the math 
department 
came, 
and 
they 
talked about Calc I through III, 
and a lot of our faculty came just 
to have a dialogue over what do 

our students need, what do they 
provide and how can we actually 
align the math curriculum and 
the engineering curriculum for 
the needs of the 21st century 
engineer,” Millunchick said.
When asked about students 
opting to take classes outside of 
the University, Millunchick did 
not comment, citing a lack of 
data.
Regardless, 
the 
reputation 
of many of the University’s 
STEM 
classes 
continues 
to 
impact students’ decisions to 
complete the courses outside 
of the University, according to 
McNamee. 
“My roommates actually have 
never taken a calc class here at 
Michigan math, but they do have 
to take Calculus I,” McNamee 
said. “And even though they 
haven’t really looked into it, 
haven’t really heard anything 
about the calc classes other 
than what they’ve heard from 
the grapevine, they still are not 
willing to take it here, despite 
not having ever tried a calc class 
here.”

“How can we trust his student 
government, that was run on a 
campaign of inclusion, when he 
believes radicalism is ingrained 
in our societies?”
Gerstein released a statement 
on 
his 
personal 
Facebook 
page 
Wednesday 
afternoon 
apologizing for any harm caused 
and saying he no longer holds the 
views conveyed in the video. 
“I have grown considerably 
since I made those statements, 
and 
the 
repulsive 
views 
I 
expressed 
in 
the 
video 
no 
longer 
reflect 
my 
current 
understanding,” 
Gerstein 
wrote in his statement. “I am 
devastated to see them reappear 
and be defended today. I know 
an apology is never enough and 
I am complicit in the oppression 
of Palestinians through my past 
actions.”
The statement from Arab 
Student 
Association 
and 
SAFE also called on CSG to 
recognize a resolution passed 
in 
2017 
supporting 
Boycott, 
Divestment, Sanctions . Though 
CSG supported the resolution 
after a contentious debate, the 
University’s Board of Regents 
ultimately voted against the 
action, which would have made 
the board create a committee 
to investigate three companies 
operating in Israel and involved 
in 
alleged 
human 
rights 
violations against Palestinians.l.
The statement said Gerstein’s 
comments 
are 
particularly 
hurtful 
considering 
past 
instances 
in 
which 
pro-
Palestinian activists have been 
targeted 
for 
their 
activism. 
The Daily investigated Canary 
Mission, a pro-Israel blacklist 
that named multiple University 
students 
as 
anti-Israel 
for 
partaking in actions such as 
voting in support of BDS as a 
CSG member.
“If we cannot trust that our 
own student body government 

president 
believes 
in 
our 
humanity, how can we feel 
supported and safe on our 
campus,” the statement read. 
“Our community can no longer 
trust any intentions or policies 
from 
the 
Central 
Student 
government, and once again have 
watched our university isolate 
and turn their backs on us.”
In an interview with The 
Daily Wednesday night, Gerstein 
acknowledged 
his 
comments 
and the statement circulated by 
SAFE on Facebook. He also said 
the changes demanded in their 
statement were reasonable and 
that CSG would pursue them in 
the following weeks. 
“I think in the statement by 
SAFE last night, they outlined 
some really important points that 
I had not previously considered,” 
Gerstein said. “Just in general, 
with the executive order that 
came from the White House 
— that I believe is a targeted 
attempt to silence Palestinian 
activism — there has been an 
increased climate of hostility 
towards those communities. I 
want to make sure that I’m not 
derelict in my responsibility to be 
a partner in their movement.”
LSA 
senior 
Sharif-Ahmed 
Krabti initially shared the clip on 
Facebook, which contains a short 
portion of the 15-minute video, 
in which Gerstein questions 
whether the Palestinian people 
are worthy of a state. 
In his interview with The 
Daily, Gerstein reiterated his 
positions have changed and he 
no longer agrees with anything 
said in the video. He also said he 
recognizes his role in combating 
oppression on campus. 
“I 
think 
this 
video 
is 
a 
representation 
of 
what 
specifically 
we’re 
fighting 
against, which is a frame of 
thought that denies and erases 
the history and real story of 
people,” Gerstein said. “And back 
in when I was in high school and 
in middle school, I had beliefs that 
were complicit in that. And so I 
think it’s incumbent upon people 

who are in leadership positions, 
especially 
representing 
the 
different communities we have 
on campus that are oppressed 
and marginalized, we do have a 
responsibility to not be passive 
members in fighting systemic 
oppression.” 
Gerstein also urged people 
to not defend his previous 
statements, 
explaining 
he 
recognizes the harm the video 
has caused. He thanked fellow 
students at the University for 
helping him evolve. 
“I hope people who would 
defend what I said in the past, 
recognize 
the 
real 
impact 
that words and the history of 
our society have on people,” 
Gerstein said. “(It’s important) 
to participate in that difficult 
path of realizing the faults in 
your own thinking and have 
the 
vulnerability 
to 
move 
forward and seek empathy. I 
would encourage people not to 
resist being open to change and 
being open to empathy. I want 
to thank the students here at 
this university for showing me 
a different way over these last 
three years, and I know that 
there’s a lot more work that I 
need to do.” 
CSG 
Communications 
Director Alex Johnson released 
a statement Wednesday night, 
acknowledging the harm done 
to the Palestinian, Muslim and 
Arab students on campus by 
Gerstein’s comments. He also 
addressed the steps CSG would 
take to repair relationships with 
affected communities moving 
forward. 
“As 
an 
organization 
we 
wholeheartedly realize the need 
to better support Palestinian, 
Muslim and Arab students on 
campus,” Johnson wrote. “In 
the next several days, President 
Gerstein hopes to listen to the 
concerns and needs of impacted 
students 
and 
work 
towards 
the various asks outlined in 
SAFE’s statement last night. 
Apologies are insincere without 
corresponding action and we 

collectively are committed to 
acting on these wrongs.” 
Krabti called on the CSG 
parties running for the election 
in March to denounce this 
behavior. He specifically tagged 
the 
Facebook 
account 
for 
Mobilize, a new CSG party that 
announced its formation Monday 
night.
In a statement to The Daily, 
Amanda Kaplan, Public Policy 
junior and presidential candidate 
for Mobilize, and Sav Nandigama, 
LSA junior and vice-presidential 
candidate for Mobilize, said they 
would pursue anti-racist policies 
if put in leadership positions.
“If elected, we will require 
our 
executive 
team 
and 
strongly encourage all elected 
representatives to attend anti-
racism teach ins and other 
programs that target biases...” 
the statement said. “At this 
time, we have already submitted 
a request for, and will be 
participating in, a MESA anti-
racism teach in with our core 
team. We call on all future CSG 
candidates/campaigns to do the 
same during this election cycle.” 

Sam 
Burnstein, 

communications 
director 
for 
Change at Michigan — another 
CSG party running for seats 
in the March election — also 
released 
a 
statement 
about 
Gerstein’s comments. The party 
does not officially launch until 
Feb. 26, and no presidential or 
vice-presidential 
candidates 
have been announced.
“We 
believe 
that 
these 
remarks, 
as 
SAFE 
rightly 
states, are inappropriate and 
unacceptable for any member of 
our community - but especially 
for its chief advocate,” Burnstein 
wrote. “The President’s words 
make 
our 
community 
more 
divided, less safe and secure, and 
less inclusive and we condemn 
them.”

upporting a small business 
can 
mean 
supporting 
environmentalism 
even 
when it might not be obvious. As 
local businesses in Ann Arbor shut 
their doors, students bemoan the 
loss of their favorite unique stops. 
Recent closures include The Local 
Bike Shop, Elixir Vitae coffee shop 
and Elevation Burger. With their 
closures, we lose not only some of 
Ann Arbor’s small-town charm 
but some of the city’s built-in 
environmentalism.
Supporting small businesses is 
not a new idea. Advocates tout the 
advantages shopping small has for 
the local economy and local job 
creation. It is also widely understood 
that businesses offering products 
made locally are sustainable since 
they don’t require a large energy 
expenditure 
for 
transportation. 
The main selling point for some 
small businesses is that they 
are 
environmentally 
friendly 
alternatives, 
like 
the 
People’s 
Food Co-Op, which sells locally 
grown produce and products. 
Oftentimes, a sustainable local 
business may openly advertise its 
environmentally friendly practices 
to help attract environmentally 
conscious customers.
The sustainable habits of local 
businesses can go under the radar, 
and sometimes small businesses 
practice sustainability without 
even trying. The Mail Shoppe, a 
local mail processing, packing and 
shipping store is an unexpectedly 
sustainable business. The store, 
that looks like a house, has been 
open for more than 30 years on 
South Division Street between 
William and Liberty. The shipping 
and mailing industry as a whole is 
not an environmentally friendly 
one — however, The Mail Shoppe’s 
personalized way of doing things 
is a step above industry standard.

The Mail Shoppe doesn’t have 
more 
environmentally-friendly 
practices because they go out of their 
way to be a green business, but simply 
because, as an independently owned 
store, they have the freedom to do 
what they want. The Mail Shoppe 
uses donated boxes and shipping 
materials that would otherwise have 
been thrown away.
Ryan Powell, who has worked 
there for 12 years, said, “In the 
corporate setting, they wouldn’t 
be allowed to accept previously 
used materials like we do.” Reusing 
materials is more environmentally-
sound than using new, recycled or 
sustainable products.

Another example of a small 
local 
business’s 
unheralded 
environmentalism 
is 
Literati 
Bookstore. At first glance, a store 
selling new books and magazines 
does not seem like a sustainable 
business, though the bookstore 
has a reputation for being very 
community-focused. 
However, 
the bookshelves and tables inside 
were bought used, and the sign 
was designed and constructed 
locally. 
Both 
reusing 
furniture 
and utilizing local resources are 
environmentally-friendly business 
practices that may not be possible 
with a corporate-owned retail 
store. Public places, like Urban 
Outfitters or Starbucks, focus 

on curating a national brand 
with standardized signage and 
consistency in their interior 
decoration.
At a time when environmentalism 
is becoming a high-profile issue, 
some 
businesses, 
especially 
ones looking for good press, are 
transitioning to more sustainable 
practices. 
Initiatives 
like 
only 
offering straws upon request, 
giving out compostable ware or 
encouraging buyers to bring their 
own bags could make a difference 
in 
lessening 
the 
business’s 
environmental 
footprint. 
However, this practice of starting 
from an unsustainable position 
and working backward is slow-
moving and often has a minute 
impact. 
The 
businesses 
with 
sustainable practices that do not 
go out of their way to advertise it 
deserve more credit.
Small businesses also have 
more of a stake in the community 
as a whole. Because of their 
reliance on the local community, 
they are more likely to want to 
get involved in local politics. 
For instance, small businesses 
may advocate for more walkable 
infrastructure since walkability 
is related to a street’s economic 
productivity. A corporation does 
not have the same stake in the 
success of downtown Ann Arbor.
As the trends point toward 
more 
consumer 
support 
of 
environmentally-friendly 
businesses, it should be kept in mind 
that local businesses without an 
advertised environmental purpose 
may indeed have one. Even if a 
restaurant is not offering a wide 
vegan selection and utilizing all-
natural cleaning products, it may 
very well be providing a larger source 
of sustainability to the community.

S

ince I transferred to the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
in the fall of 2018, I didn’t 
get the chance to appreciate the 
significance 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Union 
on 
campus 
life 
until 
renovations concluded last month. 
Students starting their journey 
at the University during the 
20-month renovation period of 
the Union didn’t know what they 
were missing, and sadly, I was one 
of them.
During 
those 
20 
months 
without 
the 
Union, 
Central 
Campus lacked a heart. While the 
doors of Pierpont Commons and 
the Michigan League were still 
open, they didn’t foster the sense 
of community that the Union 
always has. The League provides 
little space for students to study, 
meet and socialize in comparison 
to the Union and is composed 
chiefly of event and conference 
space, outside of the basement 
and Maizie’s. Pierpont serves 
the North Campus community 
well, but it didn’t add to what was 
missing from Central Campus — a 
large gathering space that existed 
for students in the heart of campus.
After the renovation, with 
the block ‘M’ flag waving high 
above its tower, the Union brings 
a sense of new life to the campus 
community. I like to think of 
the Union as a great equalizer, 
where students, faculty, staff and 
alumni can catch up and bask in 
the pride of our great university. 
One lap through the Union and I 
see familiar faces from all aspects 

of my life at Michigan; we are all 
united in that space for a common 
reason. Coworkers, classmates, 
friends from Greek life and fellow 
writers at The Daily. To me, the 
Union represents the crossroads of 
my social, academic and personal 
life at Michigan.
Athlete or non-athlete, Greek 
or non-Greek, a person of any 
major or of any socioeconomic 
background 
congregates 
at 
the Union under a common 
understanding of self-perception: 
We are the student body of the 
University of Michigan. Before 
the ribbon-cutting ceremony this 
January, there was not a place on 
this campus where I could interact 
with the same range of people 
from my Michigan experience as I 
now can at the Union.
The Union’s large and stately 
presence on South State Street 
fosters a campus community that 
makes Michigan feel a lot smaller. 
Its paneled and historic halls make 
a university with an undergraduate 
enrollment of over 31,000 feel 
like a tight-knit community. The 
renovation brought this storied 
building into modernity without 
sacrificing the character or charm 
of a space steeped in history. Some 
changes had to be made to meet 
the needs of students in the 21st 
century, such as replacing the 
second floor pool hall with the new 
IdeaHub. This decision received 
some push back from alumni. I can 
recall from my first trip to the Union 
on its opening day last month that a 
middle-aged man stood on the front 

steps yelling at people entering and 
exiting the Union that this “used 
to be the best place on campus to 
shoot pool” and how removing 
it was a travesty. While this 
encounter was certainly extreme, 
I do see the validity in wanting to 
return to your alma mater and find 
it the way it was left. However, time 
waits for no man, and the needs 
of today are inherently different 
from the needs of yesterday. This 
renovation catered to the needs of 
the modern student, who needs 
space to congregate, study and eat 
more than they need space to play 
pool.
I took on a part-time job this 
semester, working as a member of 
the program staff for Conference 
and Event Services at the Union, 
helping to set up the different events 
held daily at the Union. Working 
at the Union has given me a fond 
feeling for the space, to say the least, 
and being able to assist the flow of 
such an important building to the 
campus community gives me a lot 
of pride in how I’m able to give back 
to the University, a school to which 
my character is indebted. In the 
post-renovation period, the sense of 
community and school pride I have 
felt has increased ten-fold, solely 
based on the interactions I have had 
and that I witness here nearly every 
day. The heart of Central Campus 
is back and stronger than ever, and 
may the Union last another 100 
years as we all hail back to Michigan.

The 
United 
States 
was 
founded with protest. Every 
major social change, from 
ending 
the 
Vietnam 
War 
to 
working 
toward 
racial 
equity after the Civil Rights 
Movement, has been a product 
of protest, and it is often said 
that this tendency to question 
and rebel is central to the 
American 
ethos. 
Recently, 
however, “slacktivism” — or 
the proclamation of support 
for a protest’s cause without 
active participation in the 
protest itself — has saturated 
sociopolitical 
behavior 
in the U.S. This passive 
solidarity signals virtue but 
limits the effectiveness of 
practical change. Americans 
should focus on renewing 
our 
dedication 
to 
civic 
engagement, 
whether 
that 
be voting in local elections, 
calling 
representatives, 
physically 
marching 
or 
engaging 
in 
other 
forms 
of 
political 
participation. 
If our founders had only 
signalled a disapproval of 
British tyranny among their 
friends to gain popularity, 
instead of organizing public 
demonstrations, our treasure 
of American democracy might 
have never been possible.
In this regard, the U.S. 
has something to learn from 
France. Before the pension 
protests, 
working 
class 
drivers sparked the “Yellow 
Vest” movement with a fuel 
tax 
protest, 
a 
movement 
named 
after 
the 
high-
visibility jackets that French 
motorists must carry in their 
vehicles. The outcome of this 
protest included foremost a 
six-month suspension of the 
diesel and petrol tax, as well 
as a cancellation of taxes on 
both overtime and end-of-
year bonuses, and a 100 euro 

increase in social minima for 
employees. 
The 
movement 
also encouraged protests in 
Iraq and Jordan. Due to help 
from the SNCF (Frane’s state-
owned railway company) and 
the CGT union, the pension 
protest’s victory in rolling 
back 
Macron’s 
proposed 
reform serves as a reminder 
to the American public of how 
remarkably effective public 
protest can be.
Throughout 
France, 
protests shut down cities, 
derail 
infrastructural 
systems and force significant 
concessions from Macron. In 
comparison, protests in 2020 
America are largely symbolic 
in nature, occupying massive 
space 
in 
the 
political 
imagination but little space 
in legislative change. For 
instance, some of America’s 
most 
prominent 
protest 
movements of the past five 
years have been #MeToo, 
Black Lives Matter and the 
annual 
Women’s 
March. 
While these are all worthy 
causes, it is difficult for these 
influential social movements 
to demand concrete legislative 
changes since their objectives 
target behavioral and cultural 
structures 
in 
Western 
culture. And while protest 
turnout has increased since 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
took office in 2016, still only 
one in five Americans have 
gone to a protest since he was 
inaugurated.
Perhaps the most narrowly 
tailored 
American 
protest 
movement in recent memory 
was the March for Our Lives, 
which has earned national 
recognition for stricter gun 
legislation but has led to 
little 
institutional 
change. 
Many in the U.S. may feel 
disillusioned with the lack of 

government response to civic 
action, but we can learn from 
France’s 
civic 
engagement 
that protests are effective 
when they are specifically 
action-oriented and routinely 
disruptive. The most effective 
protests, as we have learned 
from France, are those that 
target 
specific 
legislation 
with widespread and highly 
visible public support. We can 
only achieve this in the U.S. 
through continued practice.
Many protests in the U.S., 
and more locally in Ann 
Arbor — like the No War in 
Iran protest and the Climate 
Strike — enjoy social media 
support, but lack attendance 
relative to the levels of French 
activism. Civil engagement 
is a muscle that needs to be 
exercised continuously or it 
may wither. The more you 
engage — and not just repost 
and like in online message 
boards 
— 
the 
more 
you 
motivate change. As Franklin 
D. 
Roosevelt 
once 
said, 
“Democracy is not a static 
thing. It is an everlasting 
march.”
While 
French 
protests 
rage 
on 
with 
impressive 
physicality and scale, modern 
American efforts fail to match 
a similar spirit. Resist the 
cozy nook that “slacktivism” 
provides. Avoid free riding 
for 
a 
commonly-shared 
public good achieved only 
by the small minority who 
actually make an in-person 
appearence. Only by inspiring 
Americans 
to 
learn 
from 
our 
French 
counterparts, 
can we rumble the streets 
with voices and fill the air 
with picket signs. American 
protests can become more 
compelling, 
acknowledged 
and successful. But it starts 
with you.

What we can learn from the pension protests in France
F

rench President Emmanuel Macron recently backed down from his proposal to 

streamline France’s pension system, a proposal that would have awarded pensions at 

a later age based on the number of points accrued over one’s lifetime. This prompted 

protests that shut down public transport services for over six weeks and gained nearly 70 

percent public support. The demonstrations are the latest installment in a series of labor 

protests that have rocked France for two years.

You know those shows that have a season-ending 
cliffhanger that makes you scream to yourself, 
“HOW IN THE WORLD AM I SUPPOSED TO 
WAIT FOUR MONTHS TO FIND OUT WHAT 
HAPPENS?” Well, it’s been years since the season 
seven finale of “Homeland” and somewhere along 
the way, I stopped caring. 
To 
refresh 
your 
memory, when we last saw 
Carrie Mathison (Claire 
Danes, “A Kid Like Jake”), 
she had spent six months 
undergoing 
intense 
interrogation in Russia 
without her meds to treat 
her 
bipolar 
disorder. 
When 
Saul 
Berenson 
(Mandy 
Patinkin, 
“Criminal 
Minds”) 
negotiated her release, she 
was unable to recognize 
her longtime boss. When 
the new season opens, 
we have already skipped 
through most of Carrie’s 
recovery 
process, 
yet 
the repercussions of her 
imprisonment will be felt 
for weeks to come.
Saul, who now serves as the National Security 
Advisor to the President, is in Qatar trying to 
negotiate a peace agreement with the Taliban that 
would get U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. Once 
negotiations break down due to resentment from 
Abdul Qadir G’ulom, Afghanistan’s vice president, 
Saul rushes to grab Carrie from Germany, where 
she’s recovering, because she’s an “old friend” 
of G’ulom’s and, more importantly, Saul’s most 
accomplished agent. No one — except for Saul and 
Carrie — thinks it’s a good idea to put her back in 
the field. With this, the status quo of “Homeland” is 
forcefully reinstated. 
Elsewhere in Afghanistan, the nerdy Max 
Piotrowski’s (Maury Sterling, “Girlfriends’ Guide 
to Divorce”) mission to replace a listening device 

by the Pakistan border presents nothing more than 
a convoluted storyline meant to add some gunfire 
to an episode relatively devoid of violence. A more 
optimistic outlook on the season opener’s B-plot is 
that it highlights the instability and danger taking 
place in the region. Regardless, the arc that is being 
set up for the season to come is whether or not the 
United States can see if real peace in the region is 
still on the table.
Unlike other long-
running shows that fail 
to utilize the worlds 
they 
spent 
seasons 
building, “Homeland” 
brings us back to where 
we started: Nearly a 
decade after fans spent 
a 
season 
wrestling 
with whether or not 
al-Qaeda prisoner of 
war Nicholas Brody 
(Damian 
Lewis, 
“Billions”) could be 
trusted, 
the 
same 
tactic is being used to 
create intrigue with 
Carrie. After spending 
seven 
months 
held 
in a Russian prison 
without her medicine, 
it’s very possible that 
Carrie 
could 
have 
given up vital information. Carrie herself isn’t even 
sure what she’s done — she can’t remember 180 
out of the near-210 days spent in imprisonment. As 
Carrie waits for her meeting with G’ulom, she spots 
her Russian captor Yevgeny Gromov (Costa Ronin, 
“The Americans”). Haunted with memories of her 
clinging to Yevgeny and begging him not to leave, 
we’re left wondering if a severe case of Stockholm 
Syndrome caused Carrie to betray her country.
Something feels very right about “Homeland” 
ending with a storyline about Carrie’s bipolar 
disorder possibly being used as an asset by foreign 
enemies. The series truly comes full circle — Carrie, 
who was uncertain if she could trust the man she 
fell for, ends up being unsure if she can even trust 
herself.

‘Homeland’ is finally back 
after two-year hiatus

TV REVIEW

It’s almost a pity to ground Michael McElroy’s 
words in text when his everyday way of talking 
is so expressive and passionate. The director 
of “Sonnets, Soliloquies, and Soul”’s gesturing 
hands and ever-shifting facial expressions 
engaged me completely in his words, and I 
hadn’t even gotten around to seeing the run-
through of the show yet. We surveyed the 
jumble of actors milling around below from 
the balcony of the Arthur Miller Theater and 
chatted about Shakespeare, soul music and how 
torn apart our world is today.
I have never been a fan of Shakespeare. To 
me, his work has always seemed to be something 
people attest to liking 
to prove their well-read 
character. 
However, 
McElroy’s words – along 
with the passionate, non-
traditional mediums of 
song and modern dance 
with which the piece was 
performed — made the 
bard seem accessible at 
last. 
McElroy got involved 
with 
acting 
in 
high 
school, and was cast in his 
first musical theater piece 
by 
Vincent 
Cardinal, 
director of the Musical 
Theater program at the 
university. He has done 
on 
and 
off 
Broadway 
performances, has been 
nominated for a Tony 
and currently teaches at 
New 
York 
University’s 
Tisch 
program. 
He 
is 
most comfortable as an 
actor and directs only 
because he must find a 
way to express his love 
of creating. Directing is 
a way to help display that 
creativity.
“Sonnets, 
Soliloquies, 
and Soul” takes the work 
of Shakespeare and makes 
it musical, using genres 
such 
as 
soul, 
gospel, 
R&B and pop. It will play in the Arthur Miller 
Theater at 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 20, then 8 
p.m. Friday and Saturday, finishing with a 2 
p.m. matinee on Sunday the 23. McElroy began 
writing the show by sitting down and looking 
at different Shakespeare sonnets, trying to find 
the thread of emotion that connected them. 
Shakespeare used to write for the masses, 
describing the elements that make humans 
tick and creating our concept of humanity as 
we know it. Hundreds of years later, he is still 
relevant; it must be for a reason. 

Then, putting it all together, he asked 
himself, “Where’s that grain of truth in the 
human experience that can be articulated the 
same way but through a different lens?” That 
different lens, he decided, is African American 
music. With that, he sent out requests to friends 
to write a handful of songs for the show, even 
contributing some himself. All songs featured 
are originals intended for this piece. The cast is 
diverse enough in race, ethnicities and gender 
identities to be able to accurately use this music 
to bring across the theme: Love is universal, no 
matter who you are.
The piece is split into different parts. 
Some display the happy sides of the theme 
(“Blossoming Love” and “Eternal Love”). Some 
are sad, such as “Love Loss” or “Rejected 
Love.” “Self Love” sends a badass message 
of 
independence, 
especially directed at 
females. 
The diverse theme is 
reflected through the 
range of the music. The 
audience 
experiences 
everything 
from 
Motown 
group-style 
singing, to soft R&B/
pop, to hip-hop. Lines 
such as “cause baby, 
you are my summer’s 
day” 
makes 
the 
complicated 
language 
in 
Shakespeare 
accessible. The talented 
cast 
members 
make 
direct 
Shakespeare 
quotes feel everyday; 
the warm, casual tone 
makes it welcoming to 
the audience.
McElroy 
aims 
to 
find 
the 
intersection 
between Shakespeare’s 
times and now, mixing 
the classical with the 
modern, 
and 
finding 
the human themes that 
still 
resonate 
today. 
It is fitting that the 
show opens with the 
prologue from Romeo 
And Juliet, as McElroy 
intends for the piece to 
“hold a mirror up to the 
world in which we live.” McElroy resents the 
polarizing “you’re either with us, or against 
us” mentality of the world today. He hopes 
the audience will learn not to focus on their 
differences, and that this show will challenge 
the viewer to broaden their mind. As the 
timelessness of Shakespeare’s themes show, we 
are more alike than we are different.
Sonnets, Soliloquies, and Soul is on Feb. 20, 
7:30 pm, Feb. 21 and 22, 8:00 pm, & Feb. 23, 
2:00 pm at the Arthur Miller Theater. GA: $20, 
Student: $13

‘Sonnets, Soliloquies, and 
Soul’ seeks to open minds

ROSA SOFIA KAMINSKI
For the Daily

The first time I met Lara Jean Covey, I was a 
freshman in high school reading Jenny Han’s newest 
release, “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” in an 
armchair at the Barnes and Noble on Washtenaw. I 
distinctly remember swooning at every flirtatious 
scene between Peter and Lara Jean and it really wasn’t 
any different for either of the movies. 
The latest release in the series, “P.S. I Still Love 
You,” follows Lara Jean (Lana Condor, “Alita: Battle 
Angel”) and Peter (Noah Centineo, “Sierra Burgess 
is a Loser”) as they navigate the ups and downs of a 
high school relationship. Addressing everything from 
jealousy to old flames, the film is the epitome of a high 
school romantic comedy. Though the soundtrack is 
much better than anything I ever listened to in high 
school, “P.S. I Still Love You” is still dripping with 
the mortifying characteristics of teenagers convinced 
that they’re in love. And maybe they are, but Lara 
Jean is still a character whose only understanding of 
what “love” is comes from romance novels written by 
ghostwriters trying to make money off of lonely people 
in airports.
This aspect of her character shouldn’t be surprising 
— the films and books are relatively similar, and for how 
much I enjoyed “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” 
once the novel experience of the love letter played out, 
there isn’t much left that makes Lara Jean’s character 
interesting, or Peter’s for that matter. The two live in 
the suburbs of Portland, Peter plays lacrosse and Lara 

Jean doesn’t like to drive in the snow. That’s it. The 
drama that ensues is a result of poor communication 
skills and two people who aren’t confident enough in 
themselves to truly trust one another. 
The introduction of John Ambrose Mcclaren (Jordan 
Fisher, “Grease Live!”) only heightens this mistrust, 
pushing Lara Jean, and the audience, to try and choose 
between the two boys. The fact that she is even able to 
make this choice, though after a considerable amount 
of consideration and drama, is a surprising character 
development for Lara Jean. Frankly, “P.S. I Still Love 
You” focuses on the wrong characters. We know Lara 
Jean and Peter are going to have issues, that’s a fact. It 
wouldn’t be a healthy relationship otherwise. It’s her 
father and Mrs. Rothschild, excuse me, Trina, who 
we want to see. The budding relationship that plays 
out in the background of the film has all the makings 
of another cliché romantic comedy without the 
unnecessary drama of high school. 
Despite its clear lack of understanding for what 
high school actually is, “P.S. I Still Love You” is, for 
lack of a better word, really pretty. The film looks like 
a teenage girl put it through the VSCO C4 filter, but 
she doesn’t know how to use the toggle features of 
the editing app. And it’s perfect. The over-saturated 
warm tones give “P.S. I Still Love You” a nostalgic feel 
that is necessary to enjoy any kind of movie set in high 
school. And while I might have been screaming at the 
fact that Lara Jean paints “PK” on her face on the day 
of Peter’s lacrosse game, at least the rich yellow of the 
school bus was still enjoyable. Beyond the comforting 
colors, “P.S. I Still Love You” also has beautifully 
framed scenes. Particularly, the driving transitions to 
literally anywhere — the drone shots of a 
car driving through a winding road with 
either trees or mountains on the side — 
were prevalent throughout the second 
film and, though a little overused, they 
were incredibly satisfying to watch. 
Both the film and the books read like 
a young girl’s fantasy of the high school 
experience. They take what we expect 
high school to be like, based on movies 
like “Pretty in Pink” and “Sixteen 
Candles,” and turn them into something 
Hollywood considers more “realistic.” 
But it’s not the ’80s, it’s not even the 2010s 
anymore, so why are we still pretending 
anybody has time to break another 
person’s heart in high school?

Review: ‘To All The Boys’ 2

NETFLIX

‘The World Beneath Their 
Feet’ is almost too precise

EMMA DOETTLING
For The Daily

“Mountaineering, madness, and the deadly race to 
the summit of the Himalayas.” The catchphrase on the 
cover of the novel “The World Beneath Their Feet” by 
Scott Ellsworth says it all. 
An epic account of the Great Himalayan Race in 
the years leading up to the Second World War, the 
new novel follows the many successful and failed 
attempts to climb the so called “Achttausender” (the 
world’s highest mountain range, stretching over 8000 
meters into the sky). This elite class of mountains 
consumed the hearts and minds of mountaineers 
all over the world in the mid to late 1930s and sent 
countries scrambling to be the first to send climbers 
to seemingly unreachable peaks. Each team attempted 
the mountain in its own distinct way, and with every 
new chapter, Ellsworth describes a different summit 
attempt and the variations in strategy that the different 
players brought to the game. 
The conditions of the world in the 1930s play an 
important role in the story as well. As the Nazi party 
in Germany gained power, the battle to the top of the 
“Achttausender” became a matter of national pride. 
The Nazi party vied to be the first to ascend the highest 
mountains in order to showcase the superiority of 
their people, while representatives of other countries, 
in turn, strived to bring glory to their home countries. 
The confusion that arose from competing climbers 
and expeditions resulted in a chaotic race to the top 
of the world, and every detail of this complex struggle 
is thoroughly recounted in the pages of “The World 
Beneath Their Feet.” 
The story is beautifully written. Ellsworth describes 
the vast Himalayan mountain stretch with reverence, 
recounting the incredible beauties and horrors that 
the climbers faced there. Through his carefully chosen 
words, the mountains come alive like ancient and 
temperamental beasts, and the mere humans striving 
for the lofty peaks are lowly slaves to their volatile 
whims. His fervent words attest to the humbling 
power of the Himalayas, telling of a “landform so 
vast and impenetrable that it altered the very course 
of history” and “behemoths of rock and ice so large 
they created their own weather systems.” Ellsworth 

describes the uncharted wonders to be found in depths 
of the Himalayas, from hidden paradises to “deadly 
crevasses and towering seracs” to dangers at every 
turn. It is easy to fall under the spell Ellsworth paints 
through his rapturous words in the first few chapters. 
Though beautifully written, it soon becomes clear 
that the story doesn’t have any real direction. It falls 
into a repetitive cycle, where every few pages a new 
expedition is described in unnecessary detail without 
the necessary emotion to compel the reader to keep 
reading. Ellsworth breezes by the death, hardship 
and trials of the human spirit that characterize these 
grueling expeditions with a nonchalant ease, leaving 
us with a novel that describes these events with an 
almost textbook impartiality. “The World Beneath 
Their Feet” is meticulously researched, but the 
level of detail that Ellsworth incorporates about the 
innumerable climbers he discusses makes the novel 
dense and unpleasant to read. The result is a barrage 
of names, dates and purposeless facts that only serve 
to confuse the reader and draw all emotion out of 
the story. Each new climber Ellsworth introduces 
becomes just another faceless individual, lost in the 
sea of dreamers who more often than not do not 
achieve their goals. Then Ellsworth is off to the next 
expedition and the next set of climbers, leaving us with 
no emotional connection to the people who put their 
lives on hold and threw themselves into harm’s way 
just to summit the Himalayan titans. What made them 
do it? Why did they risk everything just to climb these 
monstrous peaks? Ellsworth has no answer for us, only 
more trifling facts about equipment, food and weather 
conditions.
“The World Beneath Their Feet” has potential 
that stretches as high as the towering mountains it 
so lovingly describes, but in the end it falls short. The 
novel drags toward the middle and end, and reading 
it becomes a slow and sluggish process when it could 
have been a moving account of human achievement 
with just a little bit more emotion. Though an avid 
mountaineer may enjoy this novel, it is inaccessible 
to the average person looking for a glimpse into the 
mysterious minds of Himalayan climbers. If you are 
looking for a book about the awe-inspiring realities of 
mountaineering, stick to John Krakauer’s “Into Thin 
Air.”

SHOWTIME

I have never been a fan of 
Shakespeare. To me, his 
work has always seemed to 
be something people attest 
to liking to prove their well-
read character. However, 
McElroy’s words – along 
with the passionate, non-
traditional mediums of 
song and modern dance 
with which the piece was 
performed — made the bard 
seem at last accessible.

NOW.

This past week, as the media hype continued 
to build over the Roundabout Theatre Company’s 
upcoming Broadway production of Tony Kushner 
and Jeanine Tesori’s “Caroline, or Change,” I found 
myself reanalyzing and re-understanding this 
complex work. 
“Caroline, or Change” follows the relationship 
between Noah, a young boy in a wealthy Jewish 
family and Caroline, the family’s maid, a single 
mother of four. It takes place in 1963, the days of 
Vietnam, LBJ and the civil rights movement.
The work’s central conflict comes after Noah’s 
parents ask Caroline to keep the spare change that 
Noah keeps leaving in his pockets before putting 
them in the laundry. When Noah leaves a $20 bill 
in his pants pockets, he is forced to pick between 
giving Caroline the money or asking for it back.
Noah’s feelings in this scene quickly devolve to 
anger. He exchanges racist insults with Caroline, 
leading her to quit her job working. Noah and 
Caroline’s relationship is destroyed, their brittle 
friendship utterly shattered.
I’ve never had the chance to see this work live. 
I’ve studied the piano vocal score many times 
after getting it a couple of years ago, both playing 
through it at the piano and following along with it 
while listening to a recording.
And the more I’ve studied, the more I’ve 
struggled to understand the work’s theme, it’s 
message. What is it trying to teach me, I find myself 
asking. What should I learn from this work? How 
should I be affected by this art? How should I act 
differently?
The ending to this show, after all, is not exactly 
hard to predict. Caroline and Noah’s connection 
is overrun by the race-based socioeconomic 
stratification endemic to Southern culture in 1963. 
The music is uplifting — a unique, joyous mix of 
blues/Motown and klezmer — though the cultural 
context that overshadows it all fills one with 
despair.
In talking to my friend about this show, I was 
reminded of another Jeanine Tesori’s musical about 
race, “Violet.” The department of musical theater 
presented this show in fall 2017 as that semester’s 
studio production.
Unlike “Caroline, or Change,” “Violet” explicitly 
confronts race. It follows Violet, a young girl with 
a facial disfigurement, as she travels by bus from 
North Carolina to Oklahoma in 1964. She befriends 
a young black soldier, Flick, and his colleague, 
Monty — the show’s interpersonal dramatic arc, as 
one might expect, is Violet’s attempts to overcome 
her prejudices and befriend Flick at the expense of 

Monty.
The analogy in “Violet” — the comparison 
between Violet’s disfigurement and Flick’s race — 
is almostly obviously overt. And when I first saw 
the show, I was briefly obsessed with this concept. 
What an interesting means of confronting a delicate 
subject, I thought to myself, distorting the visual 
aspect to perceptions of race.
But as I tried to analyze the work further, as 
I tried to move past this one dramatic device and 
delve into the intricacies of the work’s message, I 
found little material to work with. “Violet” was an 
inherent criticism of judging others based on their 
looks. But it seemed to be little more than that.
Audience members leave “Violet” believing that 
they should try to see past visual appearances, 
that they should, (in a perhaps cliche manner), 
avoid the pitfalls of judging a book, or a person, by 
their “cover.” They leave assured that this was the 
impetus behind the work they just experienced.
“Caroline, or Change,” on the other hand, has no 
obvious meaning. It has no clear meaning from one’s 
first listening to one’s last. It has many individual 
meanings — many interesting devices that provide 
for individual meaning — but it lacks the hierarchy 
to pull them all together under one primary focus.
Rather than just confronting the visual aspect 
to perceptions of race, “Caroline, or Change” pulls 
apart the intersection between race, religion, 
wealth and social class. And rather than providing 
audiences with a clear message or takeaway, 
“Caroline, or Change” raises many questions while 
providing few answers.
When I think about the means of consuming both 
works, too, I’m struck by the differences between 
the clarity of thematic material. “Violet” is easier 
to watch. It is short, entertaining and powerful. 
“Caroline, or Change,” on the other hand, requires 
more time, attention and emotional stamina.
But perhaps there’s some beauty in the ambiguity 
of “Caroline, or Change.” Perhaps there’s something 
to be said for a show that is difficult to understand, 
a show that all but demands multiple viewings with 
intense analysis in between. 
Though our natural inclination may be to 
gravitate 
towards 
clarity 
and 
simplicity 
of 
messaging, perhaps there’s something to be said 
about resisting this urge. Perhaps this obsession 
the show’s ambiguity provoked in me is something 
it will provoke in many of its viewers.
And while this type of show may not guarantee 
commercial success, while it might generate positive 
feelings in relatively few viewers, it is the depths of 
these feelings that makes it all worthwhile. There 
is a meaning beneath the show’s surface, I have 
to believe, for those willing to put in the time and 
track it down. And just because I haven’t gotten to it 
yet doesn’t mean that I am never going to.

As a grown-up college-kid, it’s a rite of passage to 
graduate from high school and mock the subgroups 
of my generation who are struggling through the 
same phases of adolescence I conquered just a few 
years ago. One high school diploma and one college 
orientation later, and the same adolescent antics 
that used to carry so much significance in my life 
— making YouTube makeup tutorials and taking 
selfies with my friends on our laptop cameras — 
seem laughable now. It’s easy to forget that I was 
once part of that middle-school aged faction of Gen 
Z-ers — the group that carries an incessant need 
to part their hair in the middle and treats keeping 
Snapchat streaks like it’s a humanitarian duty. 
Yet, despite my most enthusiastic attempts to 
separate myself from this part of my generation, its 
e-boy/e-girl counterparts have made an undoubtedly 
impressive impact on today’s 21st century digital 
sphere — I’m talking about TikTok. One 15-second 
video clip at a time, they’ve converted the app from 
its originally irrelevant, adolescent status to a global 
phenomenon encompassing both mainstream and 
countercultural movements. With Gen Z’s influence, 
TikTok has become a kind of post-Tumblr entity, 
integrating countercultural trends into today’s 
mainstream media realm and promoting a culture 
of inclusivity for today’s middle school-aged folks. 
In middle school, I was never an active user of 
Tumblr. I existed in that short-lived and agreeable 
time somewhere between when the hyper-grunge 
Tumblr community was created and the lip-biting 
TikTok crowd was formed. I didn’t feel the need, nor 
have the curiosity, to explore anything subcultural 
in nature. During that time, my friends and I had 
no way to tap into the moody counterculture spirit 
that typifies today’s “e-boys and e-girls” because the 
only social media we had at our disposal, truly, was 
Pinterest and Instagram. 
But today’s middle-schoolers are immersing 
themselves in TikTok’s digital space in a way I 
could have never imagined when I was in middle 
school. After you scroll past the worrisome amount 
of clips made by 15-year-old girls “whipping” and 
“shooting” in sweatpants and not much else, you’ll 
soon find the great, emo presence of our favorite 
e-boys and e-girls: Gen Z’s current producers of 
mainstream counterculture. 
Noteably androgynous in their appearance, 
e-adolescents, regardless of their gender, have 
slowly motivated a resurgence of all things 
counterculture into the mainstream media. They’re 
giving great power to an app once deemed by many, 
myself included, as juvenile nonsense, and, because 
of this, it becomes harder to mock and make fun 

of them and their mega-influential e-posse. Call it 
cringe, call it weird, call it odd; their TikTok content 
is still making waves in 21st century media culture.
The e-girl puts the style into being sad; she is 
misunderstood in the coolest way. Her doe eyes 
shine through layers of jet-black winged eyeliner. 
Legend has it her neck has never seen the light of 
day due to the abundance of turtlenecks she has in 
her wardrobe.
The 
e-boy 
is 
her 
playful, 
middle-parted 

counterpart. Ears pierced. Nails painted. He makes 
us question what we once found so appealing about 
Zac Efron’s eight-pack and Channing Tatum’s 
gorilla-like shoulders.
Under their reign as TikTok royalty, e-boys and 
e-girls have introduced to us a new kind of cultural 
appeal, particularly for young men. Hegemonic 
masculinity doesn’t mean the same thing it did five 
years ago. With their dimpled cheeks, feminine 
bone structure and aesthetic rebellion against 
gender expectations, guys like Timothée Chalamet 
and Harry Styles are our championed e-boys. They 
demonstrate that there’s something unattractively 
insecure about toxic masculinity and present the 
notion that flexible gender presentation can extend 
beyond the limitations of subcultural phenomenon 
and find itself integrated into mainstream trends. 
Though counterculture and all of the moody 
tropes it promotes have occupied a steady presence 
throughout the decades in its multiple forms, 
Tumblr posts, Urban Outfitters clothing and 
Indie music alike, it has never before been given 
a platform as far-reaching and ultra-popular as 
TikTok. A community that spans from flat-bellied 
middle school girls to hype beasts to washed up 
B-list celebrities, the Tik-Tok-sphere has brought 
countercultural content to its middle-school Gen Z 
audience, thus perpetuating the idea that it’s cool to 
challenge the status quo. It’s cool to lean into your 
own style regardless of gender expectations. It’s 
cool to be an e-person in whatever way you want. 
And that’s pretty cool. 

The Tik-Tok-sphere has

As it entered the locker room 
at 
halftime 
Wednesday, 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team had to catch its breath. 
The Wolverines just watched 
Illinois guard Brandi Beasley 
drive the length of the Crisler 
Center floor in five seconds, 
sinking a layup to give the 
Fighting Illini — the No. 13 team 
in the Big Ten — a one-point lead 
entering the break. It was a fitting 
end to a first half where Illinois 
shot 56.7 percent, including an 
electric 8-for-13 from three. 
For Michigan to avoid an 
embarrassing loss to the Big Ten’s 
doormat, it would need to lock in 
defensively. 
The Wolverines did just that, 
allowing just 17 points the entire 
second half and running away 
with an 80-59 victory. 
“It 
was 
really 
nice 
that 
we weren’t in a panic mode,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said. “But I also thought 
that we needed to be locked in 
and focused. I said that we need 

to defend, we need to lock in, we 
need to focus. I was kind of on 
them during one of the timeouts, 
that we need to turn this up … 
and I think they really took that 
to heart and went back out there 
and tried to do a better job on the 
defensive end.”
From the beginning, the Illini 
were on fire offensively. With 3:28 
remaining in the first quarter, 
they entered the first media 
timeout with 21 points, 15 of which 
came from their perfect 5-for-5 
on 3-pointers. The Wolverines 
hung around — largely thanks to 
scoring from sophomore guard 
Amy Dilk, senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson and junior forward 
Hailey Brown — but they couldn’t 
keep up with Illinois defensively.
But the second half looked like 
a completely different ballgame. 
Suddenly, 
Illinois’ 
shooters 
couldn’t find any space. After 
going underneath screens in the 
first half to deny the inside, the 
Wolverines’ defenders instead 
went over the screens to close out 
on shooters. 
As a result, Illini guards Jeanae 
Terry and Petra Holešínská — 

who each went 2-for-3 from three 
and scored eight points apiece 
in the first half — were held to 
a scoreless, 0-for-6 combined 
second half. The rest of the 
team followed suit, shooting an 
abysmal 1-for-12 from beyond the 
arc.
“They came out lights out 
(early on), and our kids had to 
realize that they couldn’t help off 
the shooters,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We had to take away space and 
give up twos for threes at that 
point and really deny the reversal 
passes. … And then we did a great 
job in the second half of not 
allowing those threes.”
Meanwhile, 
Michigan 
maintained its level of scoring. 
Sophomore forward Naz Hillmon 
— who was limited by an upper-
body injury in Sunday’s loss at 
Rutgers — contributed to this 
effort, notching 12 second-half 
points after a quiet start to the 
game. 
Alongside 
Johnson’s 
continued scoring and Dilk’s 
passing, the Wolverines got back 
to their lethal high-low attack 
that was missing Sunday, best 
exemplified by a well-worked 
fourth-quarter 
sequence 
that 
stretched their lead to nine.
“I remember it was after a 
timeout, and (junior forward 
Hailey Brown) threw me a pass I 
had to get up and get,” Dilk said. 
“And flash in the middle was open 
the whole game, and (Johnson) 
made the right read, she flashed in 
and hit the high-low to Naz who 
sealed the player off and hit that 
huge bucket for us.”
That bucket, of course, didn’t 
win Michigan the game. It made 
up just two points in a 21-point 
victory over an inferior opponent.
But 
considering 
how 
the 
Wolverines looked Sunday against 
Rutgers, it’s definitely a positive 
sign. It shows they’ve moved on 
from their most disastrous outing 
all season and are back to doing 
what they’re expected to do. 
Even if that’s just blowing out a 
bottom-tier Big Ten team.

In 
a 
game 
that 
wasn’t 
supposed to be much of a 
challenge, 
the 
Michigan 
women’s basketball team found 
itself in an early scare.
Powered by a first quarter 
in which it shot 11-for-16 from 
the floor and 6-for-8 from 
3-point range, Illinois led the 
Wolverinesfor much of the first 
half. Michigan didn’t take a lead 
until 44 seconds 
remaining in the 
half, but a coast-
to-coast 
layup 
by 
Fighting 
Illini 
guard 
Brandi Beasley 
as time expired 
put 
Illinois 
back on top by 
one 
entering 
halftime.
But that was 
the last time Illinois led, as the 
Wolverines (17-9 overall, 8-7 
Big Ten) held off the Illini (11-
15, 2-13) for a 80-59 victory. 
Early in the third quarter, 
sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon — who scored just 
three points in the first half — 
got going. After suffering an 
upper body injury in the Feb. 
13 loss against Northwestern, 
Hillmon 
struggled 
Sunday 
against Rutgers, clearly less 
than full strength. She scored 
the Wolverines’ next six points 
and finished with 15 points 
and 10 rebounds, quelling any 
concerns the injury would be a 
lingering issue. 
“She 
didn’t 
have 
a 
tremendous statline in the first 
half, but just her presence out 
there was great,” Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico said. 
“And then second half, we tried 
to go to her a little bit more and 
she kind of got back into her 
groove.”
The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
stayed 
strong 
throughout 

the 
third 
quarter. 
Despite 
giving up 42 points in the 
first 
half, 
Michigan 
didn’t 
play 
particularly 
poorly 
— 
the Illini just kept making 
improbable 
shots. 
Without 
Illinois 
knocking 
down 
an 
uncharacteristically 
high 
percentage of those shots, the 
Wolverines held the Illini to 
just six points in the third 
quarter.
“We decided ‘Let’s just take 
the ball, get the ball out of their 
hands,’ ” senior 
guard Akienreh 
Johnson 
said. 
“ 
‘Let’s 
deny 
the next pass. 
Let’s mess up 
their 
offense, 
get them a little 
rattled so that 
once they do get 
that wide open 
shot 
they’re 
shaken 
up 
so 
much that they can’t make it.’ ”
Michigan took a nine-point 
lead into the fourth quarter, 
powered by eight third-quarter 
points from Hillmon and six 
from Johnson, who finished 
with 22 points.
In the fourth quarter, the 
Wolverines continued to score 
at a pace Illinois couldn’t keep 
up with, outscoring the Illini 
23-11 in the quarter. Despite 
a brief scrum between junior 
forward Hailey Brown and 
Illinois forward Ali Andrews 
with three minutes remaining 
in the game that resulted in 
Brown 
getting 
disqualified, 
Michigan 
cruised 
past 
the 
Illini. 
After a hot Illinois start, 
the 
Wolverines 
got 
their 
offense going — Johnson and 
sophomore guard Amy Dilk led 
the way with seven points each 
— but the Illini continued to 
knock down improbable shots, 
including multiple 3-pointers 
while heavily defended. They 
led 28-24 after the first quarter, 

backed 
by 
two 
3-pointers 
apiece 
from 
Andrews 
and 
guards Petra Holesínská and 
Jeanae Terry.
But Andrews picked up her 
second foul early in the second 
quarter and had to sit, while 
Holešínská 
and 
Terry 
both 
cooled down. After combining 
for 20 points in the first half, 
the trio scored just six the rest 
of the way. Michigan, on the 
other hand, got hot from deep, 
knocking down 3-of-6 — two 
from Brown, who scored 11 
points in the first half.
“When 
(Brown) 
hits 
3-pointers, it gives her the 
confidence to play a little 
harder, play on the defensive 
end,” Johnson said. “We knew 
that the next rotation they were 
going to be out denying Hailey 
or out denying shooters and we 
were going to have an easy post 
touch.”
It wasn’t easy from the 
start, but a strong all-around 
offensive 
performance 
and 
a resurgent Hillmon led the 
Wolverines to a comfortable 
win.

Back to basics

Michigan easily beats Illinois, 80-59, behind full-strength Hillmon and 22 points from Johnson

A

lmost exactly three 
months after Michigan 
went to East Lansing in 
November 
and got shut 
out, 3-0, by 
Michigan 
State, the 
Wolverines 
went back 
to Munn Ice 
Arena and 
wrote a very 
different 
story.
They won, 
5-1, and followed that win up with 
a 4-1 win over the Spartans in 
Detroit on Monday to complete 
the sweep. 
“We looked at the tape when 
we played them here earlier this 
year,” Michigan coach Mel Pear-
son said Friday night. “It’s like a 
horror movie. We were so bad. 
And nothing against them, but we 
were just so bad, and we played so 
much better (tonight).”
On Nov. 16 after Michigan lost 
in East Lansing, the Wolverines 
were six games into Big Ten play 
and had only one point in the con-
ference standings. Before Michi-
gan got its first Big Ten win, it 
went 0-6-1 through its first seven 
conference games.
The picture for the Wolverines 
couldn’t be more different now. 
After starting out firmly in last 
place in the Big Ten, Michigan is 
now in third place and just three 
points behind Penn State and 
Minnesota, which are tied for the 
lead. If — emphasis on if — the 
Wolverines sweep Notre Dame 
and Minnesota to close the regu-
lar season, they’ll win the Big Ten 
regular season title.
In that first series against 
Michigan State, Pearson saw his 
team struggle in nearly every 
aspect of the game. The Wolver-
ines blew a 3-1 lead on the Thurs-
day night to lose, 4-3, and couldn’t 
put the puck past goaltender John 
Lethemon on the Saturday.
Wednesday in the offices at 
Yost Ice Arena, Pearson reeled off 
a laundry list of things that went 
wrong for Michigan in November.
“Just our overall compete 
level,” Pearson said. “Our execu-
tion of passing and plays. I’m 

maybe being overcritical, but 
we’re so much better in those 
areas now for the most part. … 
Just our awareness, our alertness. 
Just our compete level. Just our 
execution. Skating. Breaking the 
puck out.
“...We’re a lot different team. 
We’re playing a lot better. But we 
were way off early.”
Some of this resurgence has 
been keyed by Michigan playing 
with, for the most part, a healthy 
lineup. Michigan had five play-
ers miss at least one game in the 
12-game span between the begin-
ning of the season on Oct. 11 and 
the second game against the Spar-
tans in November for a total of 11 
man games lost to injury.
Three players have missed a 
total of four games in the 18 games 
since. Freshman forward Eric 
Ciccolini has also been lost for the 
rest of the season, but his 11 points 
in 26 games is an easier loss to 
absorb than, for example, senior 
forward Jake Slaker, who has 23 
points in 17 games since scoring 
his first goal on Nov. 23.
But it isn’t just having healthy 
players that’s enabled Michigan 
to find success and turn things 
completely around after getting 
swept by Michigan State early in 
the year.
The Wolverines spent months 
working in practice to crisp things 
up, and now that the offense has 
started to come, the confidence 
has followed.
It’s somewhat of a self-fulfilling 
prophecy. When the puck isn’t 
going in the net, your confidence 
drops, and then your next shots 
become even less likely to find 
twine. The opposite is true when 

a player is able to break out of a 
slump and start lighting the lamp.
“I just think things are starting 
to click,” sophomore defenseman 
Nick Blankenburg said. “I think 
we’re starting to figure out the 
way we need to play, and I think 
everyone’s playing to their style 
and everyone’s doing what they 
need to do to help the team win.”
And Michigan is also dem-
onstrating a full commitment to 
team defense in a way it didn’t 
always early in the year. In Mon-
day night’s win, the Wolverines 
blocked 30 shots — nearly double 
their average of 15.1 blocks per 
game.
“It’s something that we’re 
gonna have to do,” Blankenburg 
said. “I think when all the guys are 
putting their bodies on the line, 
you’re gonna keep seeing those 
games where we’re letting up 
one goal, two goals. That’s what 
we need is everybody to buy in to 
keep blocking shots.”
At a basic level, blocking shots is 
a simple box-score demonstration 
of a team’s buy-in to the gameplan. 
If players are putting their bod-
ies on the line to secure a win, it 
probably means that team is fully 
committed to the game plan and 
willing to do what it takes to win.
When the Wolverines got shut 
out on Nov. 16, they blocked just 
three shots and 16 across the two 
games.
This past weekend, they 
blocked 42.
Things are a little different 
now.

Bottom third of lineup produces

As freshman outfielder Clark 
Elliot stood on first base with 
one out in the top of the ninth 
last Friday against then-No. 1 
Vanderbilt, 
fifth-year 
senior 
infielder 
Matthew 
Schmidt 
walked from the on-deck circle 
to the right-handed batter’s box 
as the go-ahead run.
Two 
pitches 
later, 
every 
hitter’s favorite sound resonated 
throughout Salt River Fields in 
Scottsdale, Ariz. as Schmidt sent 
a 1-1 fastball from Vanderbilt 
junior right-hander Troy Brown 
skyward, launching the ball over 
the left field fence for his first 
career home run.
“It was kind of a surreal 
experience,” Schmidt said.
The Wolverines went on to 
win their College World Series 
rematch with Vanderbilt, 4-3, in 
large part thanks to Schmidt’s 
go-ahead blast.
Given that Schmidt hit in 
the seven spot against the 
Commodores, 
the 
long 
ball 
wasn’t 
necessarily 
expected. 
It was indicative of the bottom 
third of the lineup’s production 
from the weekend.
“One through nine we can all 
provide pop,” Schmidt said. “It 
doesn’t really matter if it comes 
from the three-hole or whatever 

position you are in the lineup. 
I think our team has a dynamic 
like that. It doesn’t really matter 
who it is, we can all provide pop 
like that.”
Schmidt 
contributed 
two 
RBI when he barrelled up Troy 
Brown’s fastball, but this was far 
from the only strong swing from 
the bottom third of Michigan’s 
lineup. In fact, the Wolverines’ 
seven, eight and nine hitters 
accounted for nine of the 15 RBI 
Michigan accrued in its four 
games last weekend.
It is always helpful for a team’s 
bottom third of the lineup to 
contribute to the offense, but 
Michigan’s 
current 
situation 
makes it particularly important. 
Much 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
production from the 2019 season 
— 129 RBI to be exact — left 
the team when Jordan Brewer 
and Jimmy Kerr went to the 
minor leagues. And with junior 
centerfielder Jesse Franklin — 
the favorite to fill the cleanup 
spot 
— 
currently 
injured, 
the Wolverines are certainly 
thankful for any production 
their bottom third can bring to 
the table.
Aside from Schmidt, freshman 
designated hitter and noted 
power threat Jimmy Obertop is 
another potential contributor. 
The promising freshman flashed 
his power stroke with a double 

against the Commodores and has 
repeatedly drawn praise from 
teammates and coaches alike.
“I 
made 
the 
mistake 
of 
shoving Jesse Franklin up in the 
four-hole his freshman year — 
probably not smart on my part to 
put those kinds of expectations 
on a young kid,” Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich said. “We did that 
again to Jimmy Obertop against 
Vanderbilt in the fall game, put 
him in the four-hole — that was a 
nice four-strikeout game.”
Bakich’s self-deprecating tone 
indicated that he doesn’t plan 
on moving the young slugger far 
away from his current place in 
the eighth slot in the immediate 
future. And as long as Obertop 
occupies 
the 
bottom 
third, 
Bakich thinks he will have a 
productive hitter in that slot.
“I like the fact that he’s got big 
juice in his bat,” Bakich said. “He 
can hit a double or extra-base hit 
at any time, really put a charge 
into a ball, very mature approach 
for a young kid.”
While the seventh, eighth and 
ninth slots are not where teams 
expect to see the bulk of their 
production, Michigan will take 
offense from whatever source it 
can.
After all, the cleanup hitter 
isn’t always the one making the 
walk to the batter’s box with the 
game on the line.

‘M’ tops Rutgers, 60-52, on the road

PISCATAWAY — Prior to 
Wednesday’s night-matchup, the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
had never lost to Rutgers — 12-0, 
to be exact. The Scarlet Knights 
meanwhile, currently tied for 
third in the Big Ten, were a 
perfect 17-0 at home. Something 
had to give. 
The process of breaking that 
standoff wasn’t pretty, but even 
without leading scorer, Isaiah 
Livers, 
the 
Michigan men’s 
basketball team 
(17-9 overall, 8-7 
Big Ten) held on 
to beat Rutgers 
(18-9, 9-7), 60-52, 
undaunted 
in 
a 
hostile 
environment. 
It didn’t take 
long 
for 
the 
Scarlet Knights 
to get the Rutgers Athletic 
Center riled up. Down Livers — 
who’s now missed 10 games this 
season due to injury — and facing 
a talented backcourt, Michigan 
had to dig in. 
Unsurprisingly, that grit came 
from their catalyst, senior guard 
Zavier Simpson. Simpson shot 
out of the gate with a pair of 
3-pointers and his patented hook 
shot en route to 16 points. The 
Wolverines fed off their leader. 
Amidst recent struggles, senior 
center Jon Teske even nailed a 
3-pointer. 
“It’s nothing new,” Michigan 
coach 
Juwan 
Howard 
said. 
“(Zavier’s) a smart enough player 
to know where the reads are. Any 
time a guy steps off you and you’re 
able to line it up, massage the ball, 
line the seams up and shoot it, it’s 
great. He was confident enough 

to take the shot, the ball went in.”
As the half progressed, sloppy 
possessions and turnovers — 
six for Michigan and five for 
Rutgers — were a more frequent 
occurrence than scoring plays. 
Still, Rutgers’ own energizing 
presence, guard Geo Baker, sent 
the Scarlet Knights into the 
locker room with a 31-28 edge 
after drilling a buzzer-beating 
triple. 
With the Wolverines’ rotation 
thin in Livers’ absence, Howard 
needed someone from his bench 
to step up. 
Sophomores 
Colin Castleton 
and 
David 
DeJulius 
answered 
the 
call. 
Castleton, 
who had played 
a total of five 
minutes in the 
last three games, 
converted 
an 
and-one layup to 
halt a 6-0 Rutgers run. Moments 
later, 
the 
6-foot-11 
forward 
plucked an offensive rebound out 
of nowhere, drawing a foul in the 
process. 
“Not only the big bucket that 
came in the second half, but the 
energy he gave us on the court.” 
DeJulius said. “When you’re on 
the road you’ve got to bring your 
own energy. We were just so 
happy for him because he works 
so hard, and he deserves this and 
much more.”
Confident as usual, DeJulius 
knocked 
down 
consecutive 
jumpers — culminating in a 
3-pointer from the corner — to 
hand the lead back over to the 
Wolverines with 9:14 to go. 
Solitary 
spurts 
from 
the 
Scarlet Knights were quelled 
immediately by Michigan. Every 
time fiery Rutgers’ coach Steve 

Pikiell pumped his arms in 
encouragement, every time the 
crowd rose to their feet raising 
the decibel level to absurd 
heights, the Wolverines had an 
answer.
What did those answers look 
like? Junior guard Eli Brooks 
hitting a deep 3-pointer to 
extend Michigan’s lead to nine; 
sophomore 
forward 
Brandon 
Johns Jr. and DeJulius sinking 
three 
throws 
late; 
Brooks, 
catching a lead-out pass from 
Simpson and flushing it coolly on 
the other end. 
“It comes from within your 
heart and within your mindset,” 
Howard said. “I think our guys 
displayed a lot of grit. When you 
talk about Rutgers, a very tough 
team who plays well at home, 
they put a lot of pressure on the 
rim, and today we protected the 
paint very well. … That’s part of 
the grit that I see from this group 
and I’m actually happy I’m able to 
coach it.”
In the end, it didn’t matter 
where they were or who they 
were without, the Wolverines 
stood tall in the face of adversity 
— 
something 
Howard 
says 
they’ve learned over time. 
“I see a lot of growth in this 
group,” Howard said. “... Each 
and every guy in that locker room, 
on this team has always been 
positive about the process and 
now we’re improving. Obviously 
today we didn’t have one of our 
best player, but our guys did a 
terrific job of staying locked in 
and figuring it out. At times, it’s 
not always going to be pretty.”
Sure, Michigan extended its 
winning streak over Rutgers to 
13-0, but more importantly, its 
victory over the much-improved 
Scarlet Knights on Wednesday 
indicates that the Wolverines 
have bought in, undaunted. 

Castleton makes his presence known

PISCATAWAY — For Colin 
Castleton, Wednesday’s success 
began 72 hours before the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
tipped off against Rutgers.
During 
the 
Wolverines’ 
24-point win over Indiana on 
Sunday, the sophomore forward 
played just two minutes, a 
brief stint when the game was 
already well out of reach. As 
some of his teammates hit the 
showers and made their way 
back to university dorms after 
the game, Castleton remained 
on the Crisler Center hardwood 
— basketball in hand — putting 
up extra shots.
No student managers, no 
rebounding 
machine. 
Just 
Castleton, the rim and the ball.
Leading up to Wednesday, 
Castleton had played just five 
minutes over the Wolverines’ 
last three games. But when 
Michigan needed a second-
half spark against Rutgers, 
coach Juwan Howard called 
his number. Castleton delivered 
a timely and-one layup and 
a 
much-needed 
defensive 
presence, 
propelling 
the 
Wolverines to a 60-52 victory.
“It’s a big thing in basketball. 
People hold their head down if 
they’re not playing,” Castleton 
said. “But I just get told every 
day, and coach Juwan preaches 
to me every day, ‘Just stay ready.’ 
“His big key word is just 
being positive. You never know 
when your name is going to 
get called. So when your name 
does get called, you’ve got to be 
ready.”
In Castleton’s case, there 
were reasons why he could’ve 
lost sight of that mindset. 
After showing promise as a 

backup center in November at 
the Battle 4 Atlantis, he was 
ultimately surpassed by senior 
center Austin Davis in Howard’s 
rotation.
Minutes became hard to come 
by as he fell in the pecking order, 
and he struggled to capitalize 
on limited opportunities. From 
Dec. 11 to Jan. 25, Caslteton shot 
a dismal 20 percent from the 
field.
But through it all, one thing 
never wavered.
“You never know when your 
name’s 
going 
to 
be 
called 
on,” 
Howard 
said. “But when 
you 
have 
that 
positive mindset 
and 
you’re 
staying 
ready, 
staying locked in, 
feeding 
energy 
and cheering for 
your teammates, 
knowing what’s 
happening on the floor, buying 
into film, coming in on off-days, 
getting shots up for yourself, 
I feel comfortable with going 
with (Caslteton).”
On Wednesday, the odds 
were stacked against Castleton. 
Lack of recent playing time took 
him out of a rhythm he couldn’t 
seize in November. He was 
forced to deal with the raucous 
crowd 
that 
had 
propelled 
Rutgers to a 17-0 home record. 
He was cold after spending the 
entire first half on the bench. 
He was forced to play the ‘4’ due 
to junior forward Isaiah Livers’ 
absence, even though it’s not his 
natural position.
Still, he made an immediate 
impact when Howard looked his 
way. His driving and-one layup 
gave Michigan its first points 
of the second half, halting the 

Scarlet Knights’ six-point run 
before they could pull away.

Castleton 
celebrated 

by 
marching 
over 
to 
the 
Wolverines’ bench, where he 
promptly went down the line 
to claim a high-five from every 
teammate.
“Colin’s a guy that everyone 
likes,” 
senior 
point 
guard 
Zavier Simpson said. “When 
he comes in the game, it shows 
his emotion, shows the winning 
positive spirit when he gets the 
and-one by just dapping the 
bench up. Being 
encouraging, 
being 
energizing, that 
means a lot.
“Because 
some guys get 
in 
the 
game, 
get an and-one, 
haven’t 
played 
the whole first 
half, they just 
think, 
‘Ah, 
it’s alright.’ … When we see 
someone on the court being so 
energized and energetic coming 
in, just giving us that boost that 
we need.”
The and-one marked the 
beginning of a 10-minute stretch 
in which Castleton changed the 
game’s landscape. He scored 
five points without missing a 
field goal, but his biggest impact 
was felt on the other end of the 
floor. He grabbed four rebounds 
when 
his 
teammates 
were 
struggling to keep the Scarlet 
Knights off the offensive glass 
and used his length to alter 
shots in zone defense.
In 
Piscataway, 
Castleton 
reaped the benefits of season-
long perseverance — the same 
characteristic that fueled his 
postgame solo shootaround just 
three days prior.
