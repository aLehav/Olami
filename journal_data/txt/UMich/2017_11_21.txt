After continued resistance 

from Ann Arbor residents, 
as well as several council 
members, City Council moved 
to 
once 
again 
postpone 

a 
decision 
on 
downtown 

developments.

Many residents came to 

argue against several zoning 
changes on Broadway Street, 
seeking to defend the beauty 
and history of their town, 
and arguing for commercial 
rather 
than 
residential 

developments. With a zoning 
change, residents feared a 
high-rise would overcome the 
charm and integrity of their 
city. 

“What do residents get with 

this development? Nothing,” 
said 
Mary 
Underwood, 
a 

resident of Ann Arbor since 
1974. “People who have to live 
beside it need benefits too. It 
should not just be for U of M 
students and employees. We 
want these areas developed, 
but we want to go about it 
in the right way for future 
generations. Ann Arbor is 
not a cookie-cutter place, and 
we’re proud of that.”

One 
resident, 
Angela 

Baker, expressed concern for 
parking issues in her own 
neighborhood.

“How much more do we 

have to bend before we break,” 
Baker asked. With plans for 
new developments, residents 

continued to express concerns 
about traffic, parking and how 
to keep Ann Arbor a dense 
city with close commercial 
retail shops.

The 
zoning 
changes 
— 

particularly the brownfield 
site plan — can alleviate 
environmental issues years 
in 
the 
making. 
Zachary 

Ackerman, D-Ward 3, argued 
the 
zoning 
change 
and 

proposed development could 

solve a $15 million issue of 
water contamination.

Ackerman 
argued 
the 

developments 
could 
meet 

the rising housing demand, 
stressing the necessity for 
more affordable and readily 
available housing. 

“We have a huge demand,” 

Ackerman said, referencing 
the rise in the undergraduate 
population at the University 
of Michigan by 5,000 students 

in the past few years. 

Ackerman also noted 55 

percent of people in Ann 
Arbor are renters. 

“Are 
they 
attractive? 

No,” Ackerman said about 
residential buildings. “But are 
they housing people? Yes.”

The decision to postpone 

the decision and the idea of a 
change in zoning itself was a 
controversial topic among the 

Water supply lines to the 

city of Ann Arbor water line 
have 
ruptured 
and 
could 

possibly lead to a shutdown 
of the city’s water treatment 
facility for two to three days 
to repair the lines. Craig Hupy, 
Ann Arbor’s public services 
area administrator, debriefed 
City Council at its meeting 
Monday night.

Running from the Huron 

River, the two water lines 
reportedly were affected by the 
rupture. The initial rupture of 
one of the pipelines happened 
Saturday, and efforts to divert 
the flow from the ruptured 
line to the intact one were 
unsuccessful, forcing the city to 
bring in an outside contractor.

If 
the 
repairs 
are 
not 

successful 
by 
Tuesday, 
the 

water treatment facility will 
be forced to shut down, and 
citizens will have to limit water 
usage for two or three days so 
repairs can take place.

The University of Michigan 

Senate Assembly, the University’s 
leading faculty governance body, 
gathered Monday afternoon to 
learn the results of the faculty 
campus climate survey. Guest 
speaker Robert Sellers, vice 
provost for Equity and Inclusion 
and 
chief 
diversity 
officer, 

presented the information from 
the 2016-17 survey. Overall, 72 
percent of tenured faculty and 
75 percent of nontenured faculty 
reported they were satisfied or 
very satisfied with the climate — 
which is consistent with students 
and staff.

However, 
white 
faculty 

members were more than two 
and a half times more likely 
than African-American faculty 
members to report they are 
satisfied with overall campus 
climate, and over three times 
more likely than those who are 
Hispanic or Latino.

Seventy-one percent of the 

faculty sample responded to the 
survey, much higher than the 
typical climate survey response 
rate of 22 percent to 27 percent.

After 
garnering 
support 

from students and faculty 
at all three University of 
Michigan 
campuses, 
a 

campaign called #WeExist to 
add a Middle Eastern/North 
African 
identity 
category 

to 
University 
documents 

launched 
Monday 
night. 

A running online petition 
features 
more 
than 
350 

faculty and staff signatures in 
support of the identity box. 

“For the University, the 

ability 
to 
ascertain 
who 

identifies with the ME/NA 
community is a necessary 
step in developing programs 
and interventions to address 
any 
disparities 
and 
to 

achieve Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion (DEI) goals,” the 
petition reads.

Data 
from 
the 
sample 

campus climate survey found 
ME/NA-identifying students 
to make up 2 percent of the 

student 
body. 
Resolutions 

in 
favor 
of 
creating 
a 

Middle 
Eastern/North 

African 
identity 
category 

were 
passed 
by 
Central 

Student 
Government 
last 

February and by LSA Student 
Government last month — 
the CSG resolution passed 
unanimously.

This lack of a Middle 

Eastern/North African option 
on 
University 
documents 

from application forms to 
financial aid is mirrored by 
the U.S. Census documents 
sent out every 10 years. The 
Arab American Institute has 
been leading the charge on 
this issue, saying the current 
method 
of 
tabulating 
the 

number of ME/NA citizens 
in the country is inaccurate. 
Including 
the 
ME/NA 

category, some argue, would 
have positive effects on issues 
of health, education and more.

According 
to 
the 
Arab 

American Institute, adjusted 
for 
under-reporting, 

Michigan is ranked second in 
the nation for highest Arab-

Ann Arbor’s deer cull is 

coming 
back, 
and 
it 
could 

bring widespread park closures 
around the city.

The deer cull has been a 

hotly 
debated 
topic 
among 

residents since City Council 
approved 
the 
procedure 
in 

August 2015. The proposal that 
passed outlined a four-year plan 
for deer management and the 
exploration of a deer fertility 
control program.

“The 
directive 
from 

Council arose as a result of 
numerous resident reports of 
deer 
damaging 
landscaping 

and natural areas as well as 
concerns 
regarding 
vehicle/

deer collisions and deer-borne 
diseases,” a statement on the 
city website reads.

In October of this year, 

it was announced that the 
city 
would 
contract 
with 

White Buffalo, Inc. for deer 
sterilization and sharpshooting 
management services for 2018. 
The management program is 
reported to start on Jan. 2, and 

locations where the shooting 
takes place — which are largely 
city parks — will be closed 
between 3 p.m. and midnight 
each day.

Last year, 10 city parks were 

closed for the cull. Locations 
on this year’s list include 
Bird Hills Nature Area, 
Leslie Woods, the Leslie 
Park Golf Course, Olson 
Park and others, including 
some parks that weren’t 
used 
during 
previous 

culls, 
such 
as 
Baxter, 

Folkstone, Foxfire West, 
Glazier 
Hill, 
Narrow 

Gauge 
Way, 
Oakridge, 

Oakwoods, 
Sugarbush 

and Traver Creek Nature 
Area. 
Some 
parks 
on 

the list last year did not 
reappear on the 2018 list.

The 
Ann 
Arbor 

community 
is 
divided 

on the issue of the cull, 
with over 1,500 residents 
signing a petition as of 
this month that urges the 
city to stop the practice. 

At the University of Michigan, 
critics are also speaking out. The 
Friends of Ann Arbor Wildlife 
in Nature, an animal rights 
group formed to oppose the 
cull, staged a protest last year. 
People marched to the Nichols 

Arboretum while holding signs 
with phrases such as “Stop the 
Shoot” and “U of M: University 
of Murder.”

council members. Jack Eaton, 
D-Ward 4, and Jane Lumm, 
I-Ward 
2, 
argued 
against 

the postponement and the 
project itself, saying the only 
reason to postpone would be 
to avoid the controversy, not 
for the developers to make any 

changes to their plans.

“It’s the wrong direction for 

the opportunity that we have 
here as stewards of the future 
of our city,” Anne Bannister, 
D-Ward 1, said amid cheers 
from the crowd against the 
development.

Ultimately, 
the 
council 

decided 
to 
postpone 
the 

decision 
once 
again 
in 

hopes of a compromise with 
developers. Ron Mucha, a 

developer from Morningside, 
said 
the 
company 
would 

take the next two weeks to 
revise the site conditions by 
modifying the architectural 
expression, building materials 
and zoning conditions. 

“We owe it to ourselves and 

the community to see,” stated 
Mayor Christopher Taylor in 
support of the postponement.

Amid 
the 
controversy 

regarding 
downtown 

development, 
council 

members glossed over a water 
treatment plan in response to 
a recent water line rupture. 
Members were hopeful for 
a repair by Tuesday, but 
discussed plans to alert the 
community 
and 
implement 

plans 
for 
voluntary 
water 

restrictions during the repair, 
as well as future ideas about 
a building a new water line 
further down the road.

violence 
transgender 
people 

face, which is something she 
hopes to change.

“Transgender 
Day 
of 

Remembrance 
is 
really 

important 
for 
me 
as 
a 

transgender woman because 
it’s the only day that is really 
dedicated to remembering the 
lives lost,” she said.

The 
vigil 
is 
especially 

significant 
this 
year, 
as 

Kaufman said 2017 marks the 
deadliest year on record for 

transgender individuals, with 
25 transgender people murdered 
in the United States and 350 
worldwide. These victims were 
disproportionately transgender 
people of color at 84 percent. 
Three of these murders took 
place in Texas, where there 
is no statewide law banning 
discrimination based on gender 
identity as a hate crime.

Kaufman, along with several 

other board members from 
LGBT+ Michigan, read the 
names and stories of the 25 
individuals 
who 
lost 
their 

lives in the United States this 
year and expressed their belief 
that each “rest in power.” 

Kaufman 
explained 
many 

of these individuals, among 
these 
47-year-old 
Stephanie 

Montez and 41-year-old Mesha 
Caldwell, were misgendered in 
initial reports, which Kaufman 
she 
said 
is 
the 
“ultimate 

disrespect.”

Ally Steinfeld, a 17-year-

old 
transgender 
teen 
from 

Missouri, 
was 
killed 
in 

September of this year. Her 
story was especially striking to 
Kaufman.

“The way in which my little 

sister 
Ally 
was 
murdered 

galvanized 
me 
to 
take 

action,” Kaufman said. “Her 
murder made me furious and 

heartbroken. I realized I had to 
do this kind of event after that.”

Those who attended the vigil 

included LGBTQ individuals 
and allies, all of whom hoped to 
bring awareness to transphobia 
prevalent 
in 
society 
and 

to 
advocate 
for 
the 
trans 

community.

LSA 
sophomore 
Rachel 

Arone said she attended the 
event to stand up as an advocate 
for transgender individuals.

“I have some very close 

friends who are trans and who 
have suffered from the rampant 
transphobia in our society,” she 
said. “I want to do anything I 
can to support and be present 

as someone who has a voice 
when so many trans voices are 
silenced.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Christine 

MacKenzie 
also 
attended 

the vigil in support of the 
transgender community.

“I’ve known several trans 

people during the process of 
their transition,” she said. “I’ve 
learned about their struggles 
mentally, 
physically 
and 

societally, and it is so important 
to be there in support even if 
(transphobia) doesn’t affect you 
directly.”

Kaufman 
concluded 
the 

vigil with a reading from her 
book, “From Death to Life,” a 

collection of poems about her 
experience as a transgender 
woman. She told those in 
attendance to look toward the 
future to continue making a 
difference.

“I want people to come 

out every day and call out 
transphobia when they see it, 
to stand up for our civil rights 
and our liberties so we are 
treated with some semblance of 
equality in society,” she said. “I 
want everyone here who is not 
trans to remember the names 
that were said tonight and to 
understand that the work that 
we do does not end tonight. It 
starts today.”

VIGIL

“The University of Michigan’s 

faculty vary on a number of 
different 
dimensions,” 
Sellers 

said to begin his presentation. 
“Overall, faculty report positive 
experiences.”

Despite the overall feeling of 

satisfaction, there are disparities 
among the responses.

African-Americans 
are 
five 

times more likely, and Latinos four 
and a half times more likely, than 
white faculty members to report 
they have been discriminated 
against in the past 12 months.

Many other groups reported 

being discriminated against as 
well. Fifty percent of women on 
the tenure track, and 33 percent 
of women on the nontenure track 
report experiencing at least one 
discriminatory event. Twenty-two 
percent of those with disabilities 
on the tenure track and 25 percent 
of those with disabilities not on 
the tenure track reported being 
discriminated against as well.

“The goal is not for the data 

to sit up in my office, but for the 
data to be of value to the larger 
University community,” Sellers 
said.

Earlier in the meeting, the 

Senate Assembly met in small 
groups to discuss the importance 
of diversity, equity and inclusion 
relevant to their teaching or 
service, and what the University 
can do to promote the values 
throughout the community.

Research librarians Bob Fraser 

from University of Michigan at 
Dearborn and Laura Friesen from 
University of Michigan at Flint 
joined pharmacology professor 

John Traynor to speak about 
the difficulty of uniting students 
from different backgrounds — 
especially considering the lack 
of diversity of the Ann Arbor 
campus.

“Ten percent of your student 

population is in the top 1 percent 
economically,” Fraser pointed out. 
“Most of our students here are 
students of privilege. So thinking 
of ways to help them empathize 

with other, they’ve never had to 
run against that before.”

The members also discussed 

the 
Go 
Blue 
Guarantee, 

acknowledging that even with 
financial 
aid, 
many 
eligible 

students do not apply to the 
University.

“It is still difficult for people 

from that background to come to 
this Michigan,” Traynor said. “I’m 
not saying they’re not trying.”

Ultimately, the group agreed 

on the importance of students 
interacting 
with 
peers 
from 

different backgrounds.

“How do we get to the place 

wherein we get people to be more 
empathetic, more understanding 
and 
more 
caring 
with 
one 

another?” Fraser asked.

“There’s been various versions 

of forcing it (and) it hasn’t worked 
before,” Friesen and Traynor 
agreed.

remarks. He discussed the 
importance of remembering 
those that who been killed, as 
well as protecting and honoring 
those who are still alive. At 
the University, approximately 
1 percent of the student body 
identifies 
as 
transgender 

or 
gender 
nonconforming, 

according to results from the 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
campus climate survey.

“Our 
individual 
and 

collective work must honor and 
deeply listen to the realities 
of 
people’s 
experiences 

navigating 
and 
confronting 

violence 
that’s 
continually 

perpetuated through actions 
and systems and structures,” 
Sherry said. “It’s essential 
to recognize the lives that 
have been taken and it’s also 
incredibly important to honor 
those that are here in the face 

of violence every day.”

Social Work student Alex 

Kime 
expressed 
the 
same 

sentiment.

“Even though it’s incredibly 

important to honor those that 
we lose, more honor should 
be 
paid 
and 
recognized 

to 
the 
trans 
and 
gender 

nonconforming 
folks 
that 

are still alive,” Kime said. 
“There can be this dangerous 
foregrounding of all queerness 
as a sight of tragedy or as 
something that is inextricably 
and already ruined in some 
way.”

After his opening remarks, 

Sherry introduced LSA senior 
Emily Kaufman, president of 
LGBT Michigan, who talked 
about the challenges she faces 
every day as a trans woman.

“I tell people that I don’t think 

I’ll make it out of my twenties 
without 
personally 
knowing 

a transgender woman who is 
murdered,” Kaufman said.

Next 
to 
speak 
was 

Information student Vidhya 

Aravind. She had two sets of 
remarks, one aimed toward 
her transgender peers and 
one in which she addressed 
everyone. In her remarks for 
everyone, she named days she 
would rather celebrate rather 
than the Transgender Day 
of Remembrance, including 
“trans day of doing literally 
anything else because we all 
already know that trans people 
die all the time,” and “trans 
day of giving a shit about 
us while we’re still alive.” 
Aravind received laughter and 
support from attendees after 
her remarks.

After 
Aravind 
spoke, 

two students and members 
of 
the 
LGBTQ 
community 

read the known names of 
each transgender and gender 
nonbinary person to have died 
in the world in the past year. 
After each name was read, the 
audience was asked to repeat the 
phrase “rest in power” to signify 
the deaths that occurred in a 
socially unjust way. After all the 

names were read — which took 
half an hour in sum — attendees 
paused for a moment of silence.

Rackham 
student 
LaVelle 

Ridley, who was on the planning 
committee for the event, gave 
closing remarks. She stressed 
the importance of remembering 
transgender 
issues 
are 

intersectional.

“We have to remember that 

also indigenous American trans 
women, disabled trans women, 
non-Western 
trans 
women, 

women from the global south, 
such as Brazil, and incarcerated 
trans women also face high rates 
of death and violence,” LaVelle 
said.

She concluded her remarks 

with a call to action and a quote 
from scholar Sarah Langley.

“Our task is to move from 

sympathy to responsibility, 
from complicity to reflectivity, 
from witnessing to action. It is 
not enough to simply honor the 
memory of the dead; we must 
transform the practices of the 
living,” LaVelle finished.

American 
population. 
The 

same case study reports the 
number of Michigan residents 
who claim an Arab ancestry has 
almost tripled since 1980.

LSA senior Jad Elharake, 

one of the main organizers of 
the campaign, sent a petition 
to University faculty and staff 
a few days ago outlining the 
movement and his reasons why 
the identity category should 
be added. He said a number of 
campus communities illustrate 
campus-wide support for the 
initiative.

“(The ME/NA community) is 

a community on campus that’s 
not being recognized and not 
being 
acknowledged 
really, 

especially 
when 
you 
don’t 

have a checkbox on University 
documents,” 
Elharake 
said. 

“Us not having this checkbox 
removes 
a 
lot 
of 
potential 

support for us and really puts us 
behind compared to many other 
communities on campu,s and so 
this is what it means to us and 
why it’s so critical.”

Sally Howell, the director of 

the Center for Arab American 
Studies 
at 
U-M 
Dearborn, 

supports 
the 
campaign 
and 

said the high proportion of 
Arab-American 
students 
at 

the 
Dearborn 
campus 
and 

surrounding cities cannot be 
accurately measured without a 
ME/NA identity checkbox.

“We don’t want to count Arab 

Americans or Middle Eastern 
Americans just so we can know 
how many there are but this is a 
community that has, for the last 
20 years roughly, been treated 
differently 
by 
our 
society, 

been thought of different and 
represented differently in the 
media and treated differently 
by 
the 
U.S. 
government,” 

Howell said. “Therefore, their 
experiences of citizenship and 
the lives of our students on 
campus, they’ve experienced 
the world a little bit differently 
than other people so we need 
to know what the issues they’re 
facing are. We need to know 
how well they’re doing as a 
community.”

According to a USA Today 

Diversity 
Index 
report, 
the 

odds of selecting two Michigan 
residents randomly and having 
them be of different ethnic 
or 
racial 
backgrounds 
will 

jump from 39 percent to 60 
percent by 2060. Faced with 
these reports and the already 
large concentration of Arab 
Americans 
in 
Michigan, 

Elharake said, after talking with 
alumni, the ME/NA identity 
category 
conversation 
has 

been circulated among ME/NA 
communities at the University 
for years now.

“This has been a conversation 

for over a decade and it’s been, in a 
sense, every year it’s been pushed 
off and pushed off and pushed off, 
and we don’t have time for that 
anymore,” Elharake said. “Enough 
is enough and this is the time for it.”

Elharake said he plans to bring 

the petitions from students, faculty 
and speakers to the next Board of 
Regents meeting on Dec. 7.

Howell said she has seen large 

amounts of support from students, 
faculty and administration at the 
Dearborn campus for the initiative. 
She said the issue is not a question 
of whether the checkbox should be 
added but, rather, how to go about 
implementing it.

“I’ve 
seen 
the 
interest,” 

Howell 
said. 
“The 
students 

seem to understand the issue 
and how important it is across 
the spectrum of different kinds 
of 
student 
organizations 
and 

students representing different 
populations on campus. There’s 
just overwhelming support for 
the idea.”

Society, 

participated in the march, and 
told The Daily last winter he felt 
the deer cull was unethical. He 
wanted to see the city to explore 
nonlethal options.

“Personally, I just think it’s 

maybe wrong or rash to make 
this decision,” Brodkey said. “I 
feel like we’re taking it into our 
own hands and playing God in 
this position and saying, ‘Hey, 
we need to massacre 100 deer 
for who knows what reason?’”

Jim Kosteva, director of 

Community Relations for the 
University, on the other hand, 
told The Daily in early 2017 
that the cull was necessary 
to preserve other aspects of 
wildlife in the arboretum.

“The Nichols Arboretum, 

which 
is 
expected 
to 
be 

a 
showcase 
and 
living 

laboratory of diverse species, 
has been unable to establish 
many seedlings due to the 
overgrazing of the deer herd,” 
Kosteva wrote. “The University 
has also incurred a significant 
loss of landscape materials, 
particularly on North Campus, 
that have been consumed or 
damaged by deer. Replacing 
that material has required a 
costly diversion of funds that 

otherwise could support more 
mission centered activities.”

According to MLive, this 

year’s cull will be slightly 
different from previous years, 
as the city will also be reviewing 
their fencing ordinance and 
deer-crossing 
signage 
and 

increasing their deer education 
efforts.

Despite public opinion, the 

cull presses on, and a statement 
from the city last year regarding 
park closings and the cull 
assures safety of every being is 
the city’s main concern.

“Safety is the city’s top 

priority. … Information will be 
provided when cull activities 
are 
completed,” 
the 
press 

release states.

University alumni Patrick 

Rabban 
and 
Chris 
Asmar 

came up the idea for their 
app during their senior year 
in college. They sought a way 
to organize quotes and inside 
jokes from friends, and thus, 
“Echollection” was born. 

Echollection is a social 

media app that allows users to 
store, organize and customize 
quotes. 
Users 
can 
attach 

pictures and locations to their 
quotes, all of which are stored 
on their personal profiles. In 
addition to organizing, users 
can also “like,” share and 
comment on other posts.

Although 
Echollection 

is categorized as a “social 
networking” app in the Apple 
Store, Rabban discussed how 
the app functions more as a 
resource or tool.

“Nearly every person I 

know keeps a word document 
or journal where they log all of 
their favorite quotes, whether 

it’s from a favorite author or a 
family member,” Rabban said. 
“The feature that sets us apart 
is (that) you can create folders, 
categories, 
subcategories 

for your “echoes,” and you 
can even attach location and 
images.”

Despite the app’s inception 

in 
2011, 
development 
on 

Echollection began in 2015. 
According 
to 
Raban, 
the 

co-founders have been busy 
promoting the app on social 
media outlets, planning launch 
parties and networking while 
maintaining full-timejobs.

The app is still new to 

the industry, however. Beta 
tester Salem Najjar mentioned 
Echollection sets itself apart 
by providing an organized 
approach 
to 
remembering 

special moments.

“I 
thought 
the 

functionality was very good 
and I felt that it had fulfilled 
a need in the market, kind of 
white space in the industry,” 
Najjar said. “There should be 
a way to track and remember 

those quotes and memories in 
the future because they had an 
impact on us the moment we 
first heard them.”

Sandra Kizy, another beta 

tester, believes the app is great 
for use on social media posts 
centered around family or 
friends.

“You hear quotes all the 

time, and we all have our 
phones so it’s so easy to put 
it in,” Kizy said. “This is the 
only app of its type that I’ve 
seen, so that’s what makes it 
unique, because it’s the only 
app that I know of that stores 
quotes.”

According 
to 
Rabban, 

one of the most important 
steps in developing an app 
is forming a team of reliable 
business 
partners. 
Rabban 

suggested students looking to 
create their own apps should 
be cautious about whom they 
choose to work with. Students 
also should focus on the 
simplest form of their idea 
before introducing the app to 
the market, he added.

Business 
sophomore 

Lucian Ramnarase said he 
thinks the concept behind 
Echollection 
is 
interesting 

because people use quotes on 
other social media platforms.

“If people want to see these 

quotes to pick themselves up 
and make them smile, they can 
go to this app,” Ramnarase 
said. “You know what you’re 
going to get with this app, and 
that’s a reason why I’d use it 
and why I think other people 
would use it.” 

Currently 
Rabban 
and 

Asmar are still working to 
promote 
Echollection 
in 

multiple forms.

“It’s one thing to capture 

that 
moment 
and 
phrase 

in context with photo and 
location, it’s another thing 
looking back years down the 
road we have created since 
college that have gone ahead 
and saved in there,” Rabban 
said. 
“Almost 
unanimously 

the response has been this is 
a great idea and I can’t believe 
nobody has done this before.”

I 

n the past several days, my 
92-year-old grandmother’s 
health has starkly declined, 

and she is currently 
in the hospital. The 
consensus 
among 

my family, based on 
what doctors have 
told us, as well as 
my 
grandmother’s 

chosen 
course 
of 

action, is that she is 
going to die soon.

My 
grandma 

— 
my 
father’s 

mother, whom I call 
Bubba — is the only 
grandparent I’ve ever gotten to 
know. My mother’s parents were 
both gone by the time I was born, 
and my dad’s dad died when I 
was almost 2 years old.

I think this made it difficult to 

establish a precedent of having 
large family gatherings. Without 
that generation’s input — without 
my parents and their siblings 
being held accountable by their 
parents 
to 
stay 
consistently 

connected to their family — 
people drifted apart. Families 
picked different coasts and, for 
the past several years, I have seen 
my cousins and relatives once 
every other year or so, for a few 
days filled with rushed catching 
up that is only performed to 
maintain the collective idea of a 
nondescript, hazy in-the-loop-
ness with one another.

My childhood was centered, 

then, around my immediate 
family: my older brother and 
sister and my two parents. To 
make up for this absence, my 
parents would frequently invite 
friends for dinner. I looked up to 
some of these people. I gossiped 
with my mom about their lives 
and what I noticed versus what 
she saw. They became extensions 
of my family.

Indeed, my parents, from a 

very early age, taught me to try 
to make family out of my friends. 
To create a chosen family for 
myself.

My grandmother and I, then, 

never really established a strong, 
specific, intimate relationship. 
I would call her every now and 
then to tell her about my goings 
on; I played piano for a long 
while, and she had played all 
her life, so we connected over 
that. Or when I went to the 
University of Michigan, and she 
lived nearby in Novi — staying 
in Michigan after my dad grew 
up in Detroit — there was some 
excitement about being able to 
connect more often.

Once, I bought her a disc of 

sonatas composed by Bach and 
played by Sir András Schiff, whom 

I heard play at Hill Auditorium 
during my sophomore year. She 
loved it, hugging me as she told 

me how sweet a gift it 
was. She consistently 
sent me checks for 
my birthday and for 
Jewish 
holidays, 

even if my name was 
sometimes 
spelled 

wrong. One time I 
was in the car with 
my 
parents 
and 

Bubba. I mentioned 
that Diego Rivera, for 
some time in his life, 
was rumored to have 

experimented with cannibalism. 
(The rumors are true.) Bubba, 
with fantastic comedic timing, 
dryly said, “One should not eat 
his own kind.”

These are some of the stories 

that first come to mind when I 
think of Bubba. During my time 
in Ann Arbor, I have only seen 
my grandmother — except the 
times my dad visited her — once, 
when we met at The Lunch Room 
and debated the merits of Hillary 
Clinton versus Bernie Sanders. 
Seeing my grandma, I think, 
reminded me of that absence of 
extended family. Reminded me 
of her strained relationship with 
my dad, and of the possibility 
that families can gradually drift 
apart forever.

And since she has been in the 

hospital, I have only just begun 
to confront all of this. The holes 
in my relationship with my 
grandmother, the things we did 
not share about ourselves with 
each other, the stories we did 
not tell. I feel sadder now, in her 
impending death, than I ever felt 
happy with her in life.

Bubba’s health decline has 

brought to mind that I used to 
lie very casually and habitually 
to my friends, family, teachers, 
school 
administrators 
and 

friends’ parents. Lying of this 
sort is still something I struggle 
with. One lie I have told most 
frequently over the years is that 
of my grandmother’s death. I 
have used it as a way of escaping 
some responsibility or other, 
an excuse to not have to attend 
some tedious outing or once, 
even just, in eighth grade, to 
evoke sympathy and compassion 
in a girl I had a crush on. My 
grandma and her body and her 
life became props for me to play 
with as I navigated the social 
situations of my adolescence.

I feel guilty about that. And 

now, in my Bubba’s sickness, I 
feel that guilt bubbling to the 
surface of my mind. What more 
could I have done to cultivate a 
relationship with her?

I don’t know, really. I have long 

understood I’m not as close to my 
extended family as many of my 
friends are with their families. 
But the sadness I feel now, I think, 
stems from a sense that after my 
Bubba is gone, I will never be 
able to change the content of that 
relationship. Instead, this will 
be my grandmother, this will be 
what she was.

But maybe that’s not true. 

Maybe, as I grow up, I will begin 
to adopt new ways of thinking 
about my relationship with my 
grandmother. To learn a blunt 
fact of relationships — that some 
of them simply end, even those 
that were once important to you. 
And they will end in unsatisfying 
ways that will make you question 
if more life could have been 
juiced out of what you had with 
that person. And to know that is 
part of it, part of being a social 
being : the chance that it will fail, 
that you will not be able to wrap 
things up in a nice bow and share 
the wonders of that gift, together.

But I ought to know, also, the 

potential beauty in taking this 
risk. To know that each time a 
friendship does blossom, it is 
despite this risk, this potential 
sacrifice 
that 
both 
parties 

have made. To think about 
successful familial relationships 
in the context of this risk. To 
remember my mother and father, 
for example, who came to New 
York City to follow their dreams 
to be psychoanalysts and met 
at a Marxist psychoanalytic 
conference in 1980, ultimately 
falling in love and themselves 
creating a beautiful, expansive 
family that means everything to 
me today.

My 
grandmother, 
without 

whom my family would not be 
possible, lived a full, long life. 
Born in 1925, she witnessed a 
fundamentally 
transformative 

period of human history. She 
made and raised four children, 
who have collectively produced 
seven children themselves.

No matter the extent of our 

closeness in life, we will always 
remain connected, contingent, 
knotted to the same web of 
lineage. 
She 
produced 
and 

nurtured half of my genetic 
makeup, half of me and my 
siblings. This connection with my 
Bubba will continue to express 
itself as my ongoing relationship 
with my family — both given and 
chosen — develops and evolves.

I

t’s gameday, and I walk 
into a tailgate and am 
immediately a beer — 

a 
substance 
that 

would shut down all 
my internal organs 
from just a sip. All 
my 
friends 
have 

pre-gamed the pre-
game, and I know 
it’s just the security 
guards and me who 
are sober right now. 
I love to dance and 
have fun with my 
friends, but I can’t 
help but feel as if I 
am missing out on something 
so essential to the college 
experience: drinking.

When I first arrived on 

campus, I didn’t think my 
allergy to alcohol would make 
me stand out from my peers. 
In high school, I had many 
friends and many who drank, 
but it didn’t affect me. I didn’t 
think college would be any 
different, and at first, it wasn’t.

The more and more I went 

to parties, however, the more 
I felt uncomfortable. I joined 
a sorority, only to drop a week 
later under the pressure of 
alcohol-dominated activities I 
could not keep up with. Being in 
an environment where all social 
gatherings 
revolve 
around 

getting drunk and drinking 
with your friends makes it hard 
for me to feel safe.

Every club I have joined and 

every organization I have been 
a part of during my time at the 
University of Michigan has 
mentioned something about 
working hard but “don’t worry, 
we like to party too.” Great! Me 
too! But not when it involves 
projectile 
vomit, 
watching 

people who literally cannot 
stand up and emergency 911 
calls when someone has had 
too much.

As many of us know, and as 

various studies have shown, 
consumption of alcohol affects 
one’s decision-making process. 
Interestingly, 
a 
University 

of Missouri study found that 
most people are aware of the 
decisions they make while 
they are drunk, and even when 
they’re making a mistake, but 
they do not care as much that 
they’re 
making 
a 
mistake. 

The more people choose to 
drink during their crazy night 
out, the more the negative 

consequences will affect them 
the next morning. They might 
lose motivation to go to class, 

fail an exam or get 
into an argument 
with a roommate.

The 
atmosphere 

surrounding 
drinking on campus 
inhibits 
students 

from 
taking 
care 

of 
their 
bodies 

and 
convinces 

them 
they 
won’t 

have an enjoyable 
experience without 
a drink in hand. It 

is astounding to recognize the 
immense priority alcohol has 
on this campus.

Why have we set such a 

standard for college students to 
be so pressured to binge-drink 
a substance that can ultimately 
kill any one of us, not just those 

of us with an allergy? The high 
pressure and stress that comes 
along with being a student at the 
University encourage students 
to “crack a cold one with the 
boys” when they are feeling 
upset or having a shitty day.

Is that because they’re too 

afraid to actually express their 
feelings about their shitty day 
and turn to alcohol instead? To 
get their mind off something 
that needs to be talked about? 
Using alcohol as a way to 
escape will only last so long 
for drinkers. There will come 
a point when they have to 
face their problems for what 

they are and have real-time 
conversations about them.

Is the reason we have fun 

on this campus just because 
everyone is so stressed, and 
we 
think 
binge 
drinking 

will solve all our problems? 
I challenge everyone at this 
University to take a look at 
the standard social event that 
they routinely attend, and try 
to make it into something that 
focuses on having fun by being 
there, not just on the activity 
they are doing.

I have faced the many 

repercussions that come with 
not partaking in the activity 
everyone else seems to be 
doing. My relationships with 
the friends I felt closest to 
at this University dissolved 
because I wasn’t interested 
in having beer spilled on my 
body every time I went to a 
fraternity party. The rampant 
party culture that surrounds 
this campus needs to change. 
People should feel comfortable 
to make the decision to not 
drink and not be judged for 
it. I have felt othered so many 
times by choosing not to put a 
poison in my body.

Don’t get me wrong — I enjoy 

going to parties where everyone 
drinks, but the priority our 
campus 
community 
creates 

through 
a 
binge-drinking 

culture 
promotes 
the 
idea 

that you can’t have fun while 
not drinking. The resulting 
stigma discourages individuals 
who are not comfortable with 
drinking and they end up 
staying in, instead of exploring 
the incredible place we live, 
having 
a 
good 
time 
and 

meeting new people.

I have found the people I 

enjoy going out with, I have 
friends who care about me and 
watch out for me at parties. 
I truly believe we all need 
friends looking out for us, and 
I am so grateful for mine. But 
until we remove the stigma 
that promotes the notion that 
you have to drink to have fun, 
we eliminate opportunities for 
nondrinkers to feel welcome 
and included. You don’t have to 
be “black-out” to have a good 
time going out.

MONKEY PUZZLE MUSIC

Sia did the thing every pop star does and made a Christmas album
‘Everyday Is Christmas’ 
is not Sia at her jolliest

She sings about puppies & sings about snow but there’s no real cheer

As an enthusiast of decked 

out halls, poinsettias and heavily 
ornamented 
pine 
trees, 
I’d 

assumed that Sia’s Everyday Is 
Christmas would be the perfect 
accompaniment 
to 
a 
hearty 

mug of rich, steaming eggnog. 
However, where I was expecting 
Sia’s unique, raggedly beautiful 
voice to gleam with holiday spirit, 
it only simmered, never truly 
exploding into color or boiling 
over with fierce attitude in the 
same memorable way that it did in 
last year’s This Is Acting.

For the most part, Everyday 

is Christmas is filled with tracks 
that fall just short of truly 
memorable. “Santa’s Coming For 
Us” is decent pop, fueled by a 
bubbly cheer that can be expected 
from a holiday-themed album, 
but it lacks the catchiness that 
distinguishes 
classic 
seasonal 

tracks from merely forgettable 
ones. Similarly, while “Ho Ho 
Ho” is carefree at heart, fraught 
with playful references to holiday 
booze, something about the chord 
progressions sounds off — and 
not at all in a good way. By far the 
most baffling track on the album 
is “Puppies Are Forever.” The 
title alone is confounding, and the 
lyrics similarly so: “Puppies are 
forever, not just for Christmas / 

Cause they’re so cute and fluffy 
with shiny coats / But will you 
love ‘em when they’re old and 
slow?” Sia sings, her voice taking 
on a droning quality. Of course 
puppies are forever. But what 
about the concept is so significant 
that it necessitates its own song on 
a Christmas album? 

Although it’s true that only 

so many holiday related words 
exist, it feels as if Sia didn’t even 
try to come up with unique song 

titles, which is a problem for 
logical 
reasons: 
“Snowman,” 

“Snowflake” 
and 
“Sunshine” 

sound more like they should be 
vocabulary words in a second 
grade classroom than song names. 
And with the ordering of the 
tracks themselves — “Snowman” 
and “Snowflake” come one after 
the other — it’s easy to get the 
songs mixed up, regardless of how 
similar the music itself sounds. 
All of that ignores that there are 
bound to be countless other songs 
of the same name that already 
exist.

There’s always a pro for every 

con, and for this album, that 
would be the slower songs. In 
“Underneath 
The 
Christmas 

Lights,” the final track, Sia sheds 
the false, gaudy brightness that 
she relies on for most of the album 
in favor of a stripped down choral 
ballad that finally sounds genuine. 
Just as with many of the other 
tracks on the album, the lyrics are 
relatively simplistic: “You are all I 
need tonight / Oh, oh / Here above 
the Christmas lights / Underneath 
the Christmas lights,” Sia sings, 
repeating the last lyric again and 
again. However, in this song, 
the simplicity works perfectly. 
Accompanied by only a piano 
and her own backing vocals, Sia’s 
performance is akin to a heartfelt, 
deliberately measured, mellowed 
out version of Mariah Carey’s 
1994 “All I Want For Christmas Is 
You.”

After listening to a Christmas-

themed album, I want to feel as 
if I’ve been plopped onto a snow 
covered clearing surrounded 
by trees strung with bright, 
twinkling lights. My problem 
with Everyday Is Christmas is 
that with its lackluster lyrics, 
repetitive, 
droning 
choruses 

and downright uncreative song 
titles, the album only seems to 
partially commit to its supposed 
subject. It’s got the jingle and 
the commercialism down pat, 
but 
where’s 
the 
Christmas 

spirit?

ALBUM REVIEW

CBS

Where are you Will?
True to name, nothing 
happens in ‘No Activity’

Will Ferrell’s absent is noticeable in the pilot of his new series

CBS All-Access premiered a 

new TV series, “No Activity,” 
on Nov. 12 in the never-
ending fight for relevance. 
“No Activity” is an American 
adaptation of an Australian 
cop comedy, centered around 
the police force working to 
bust a major drug cartel, 
and the criminals that abet 
the misconduct. The show 
is carried out in pairs: two 
detectives 
on 
stake 
out, 

two dispatch workers, two 
criminals waiting out in a 
shipping container and two 
Mexican 
tunnelers. 
This 

paired set-up allows for easy-
flowing humor, developed on 
the innate, humorous nature of 
opposites forced to interact.

Produced by Will Ferrell 

(“Saturday Night Live”), Adam 
McKay 
(“Anchorman”) 
and 

Funny or Die, and featuring 
an all-star comedic cast, “No 
Activity” seemed destined to 
be a slam dunk. However, the 
shows title concisely states the 
show’s biggest flaw: There is 
no activity. I should preface 
this by saying I have not seen 
the Australian original; still, 
that does not forgive the 
fact that in the pilot episode, 
there is no plot movement of 
notable mention until the last 
three minutes. Prior to that 
final twist, the entire show 
consists solely of expositional 
conversation.

Another glaring error is the 

absence of the top-billed star. 
When you search the show on 
Google, the first link to come 
up says, “‘No Activity’ with 
Will Ferrell,” yet 30 minutes 
of my life later, I was left with 
a complete and utter lack of 
Ferrell; the man did not appear 
in the pilot episode. For a show 
seemingly building itself off 
the star power of the actor 
and producer, it is a bold move 
to leave him out of the first 
episode — which is a show’s 
best means of pleaing its case 

for return viewers.

While the writing of the 

show is high quality and 
delivers the trademark humor 
you’d expect from Ferrell, it 
suffers from a lack of action 
to build comedy from, and 
relies wholly on the dynamics 
between the paired characters. 
Each scene is shot in a play-like 
fashion; the two characters 
sit in the same position, with 
an essentially fixed camera 
perspective, leaving the viewer 
hungry for movement. This 
lack of literal and metaphorical 
movement in these one-on-one 
moments stunts their humor 
because the jokes that start 

off strong fizzle out by the 
time the camera pans back to 
another coupling.

The show’s trailer suggests 

that there is more quality 
content soon to come, but a 
pilot episode should always 
give viewers a good depiction 
of what’s in store, and some 
tension in the plot to ensure 
they return — this was not 
delivered. That being said, 
the comedically stacked cast 
gives the show its fighting 
chance. With no plot motion 
to 
keep 
viewers 
engaged, 

the flow between characters 
needs to be spot on — and 
it is. Amy Sedaris (“BoJack 
Horseman”) delivers her usual 
zany madness as the veteran 
dispatch worker training an 
unsuspecting newcomer, and 
Tim Meadows (“Mean Girls”) 
shines in the role of one half 
of a police partner duo, basked 
in the undertones of a nagging 
wife, due to 11 years of service 
together.

There 
is 
the 
possibility 

that leaving Ferrell out was a 
deliberate act to bring people 
back for episode two, and if 
that was the case, they’ve 
at least hooked me. I’m left 
wondering if the addition of 
Ferrell’s 
character 
will 
be 

enough to pick up the pace on 
this show a bit. Plus, despite the 
lack of plot, the quality of the 
writing and acting presented a 
compelling enough case to give 
this show a second chance, and 
perhaps give Ferrell a chance 
to save it.

TV REVIEW

In ‘Column of Fire’ Follett 
illuminates the Medieval

In the next installment of the Kingsbridge, Follett brings us back

With his recently released 

generational saga “Column of 
Fire,” historical fiction guru 
Ken Follett brings the latest 
installment of the Kingsbridge 
Series to the niche community of 
Middle Age-enthusiasts. While 
revivalist Medieval literature is 
usually associated with dense 
texts written in convoluted 
language, Follett uses plain but 
literary language to color the 
world of Medieval Europe as a 
vibrant and intricate space full 
of the same human emotions 
and experiences as any age. 
Rife with drama, sex, intrigue, 
politics 
and 
romance, 
the 

Kingsbridge books are wholly 
captivating 
and 
impossible 

to put down. These sweeping 
generational sagas are between 
900-1100 pages, but the length 
isn’t oppressive. Rather, it allows 
Follett and the reader to explore 
a wide range of issues in this 
period as well as the changes 
that occur over time. Published 

this 
past 
August, 
“Column 

of Fire” brings the classic 
Kingsbridge elements lovers of 
the series come to expect, with 
some distinct differences that 
both help and hurt it.

The 
overarching 

preoccupation 
in 
the 

Kingsbridge series is change. 
Follett 
is 
interested 
in 

architectural 
change, 
seen 

most poignantly in the building 
of the Kingsbridge Cathedral 
that spans the entire first and 
second book (“Pillars of the 
Earth” and “World Without 
End”). The narrative reflects 
the long and grueling process 
of building monuments in that 
time, and Follett describes the 
laying of each brick with an 
accuracy that communicates his 
intimate knowledge of medieval 
architecture.

Follett is also interested in 

geographical 
change. 
Over 

the three books, Kingsbridge 
expands from an insignificant 
town to a hub of trade and 
commerce. 
The 
narrative 

scope 
also 
reflects 
human 

movement over time. “Pillars,” 

set in the 1100s, focuses only 
on Kingsbridge because travel 
was difficult and dangerous in 
that century. Set 400 years later, 
“Column of Fire” spans across 
Western Europe and beyond 
in 
a 
narrative 

that 
mirrors 
the 

international 
exchange 
and 

exploration of the 
period afforded by 
advancements 
in 

technology (bigger 
and faster sailing 
ships). 

One of the most 

interesting 
and 

captivating aspects 
of the trilogy is 
its 
discussion 
of 

technology and labor specific to 
the Middle Ages feudal society. 
Follett is largely preoccupied 
with the lower and middle 
classes, the peasant farmers, the 
craftsmen and the merchants. 
Follett explores the intricacies 
behind each form of labor, 
from securing farm work to 
transporting stone from the 
quarry to dyeing and treating 

wool. Follett also focuses heavily 
on commerce, and is interested 
in the human exchange of 
currency, the negotiation of 
contracts and the dynamics of 
making a living in an age where 
people buried their savings 
underground.

Religion 
is 
another 
huge 

theme woven throughout the 
Kingsbridge books. Besides the 
working class, key characters 
in the novels include priors, 
bishops, 
nuns, 
missionaries 

and 
even 
holy 
monarchs. 

Follett explores the dynamics 
of 
monasteries 
in 
“Pillars,” 

the expansion of nunneries in 
“World Without End,” and the 

tumultuous Catholic 
vs 
Protestant 

landscape 
of 
the 

Reformation 
in 

“Column of Fire.” 
He 
both 
exposes 

the corruption of 
religious 
figures 

and 
celebrates 

altruistic religious 
zeal in an age where 
the Church was an 
integral component 
of 
life, 
and 
a 

character in itself.

Overall, 
Follett 
braids 

together 
these 
many 

preoccupations with compelling 
and dynamic characterizations. 
His characters are not static, 
but undergo emotional changes 
influenced 
by 
experiences 

that mold them and alter their 
point of view. Follett tends to 
use a character formula, and 
his books contain the same 

tropes: 
a 
male 
protagonist 

that is attractive, intelligent 
and a natural born leader; a 
strong female protagonist that 
is 
independent, 
headstrong 

and sexual, though not overly 
so; and a male antagonist that 
is 
cunning, 
power-hungry, 

brutally violent, amoral and 
asexual. While these character 
tropes can become repetitive 
and predictable, they interact in 
different ways and in different 
arrangements in each book. 
Another characteristic aspect 
of the trilogy, and what really 
keeps you reading, is a book-long 
unrequited romance between 
two key figures that is dramatic 
and overdrawn but gripping.

The 
most 
controversial 

aspect 
of 
the 
Kingsbridge 

series is Follett’s treatment of 
women. His female protagonists 
maintain 
incredible 
agency, 

have a voice, making decisions 
largely 
for 
themselves 
and 

challenge 
societal 
ideas 
of 

women’s roles. Caris in “World 
Without End” runs a prosperous 
wool business and spearheads 
the development of modern 
medicine in Kingsbridge, while 
Sylvie in “Column of Fire” 
operates an illegal Protestant 
book trade across Europe. But 
beyond these strong female 
leads, women are discussed 
mainly in terms of prostitution 
and rape. Rape in these books 
is 
frequent, 
grotesque 
and 

viewed as an inevitable part 
of life. Reading these scenes is 
uncomfortable and disturbing, 
begging the question: Is this an 

important aspect of Medieval 
life that is necessary for an 
accurate portrayal, or is it 
superfluous 
and 
indulgent? 

Follett 
writes 
women 
with 

simultaneous 
depth 
and 

superficiality that is difficult to 
unpack.

“Column of Fire” widens the 

scope of the Kingsbridge series 
and allows for new possibilities 
and areas of exploration. A game 
board with constantly moving 
set pieces, the novel involves 
characters that originate in 
England, France and Spain who 
constantly move around Europe 
and 
interact 
with 
different 

people. While this is somewhat 
daunting and confusing at first, 
the characters eventually come 
together in classic Kingsbridge 
fashion. Unlike the two before 
it, this book is largely interested 
in foreign policy and diplomacy, 
focusing on the politics between 
Queen Elizabeth, Mary Queen of 
Scots and the de Guise family in 
France, among other monarchs. 
This focus on international 
politics spotlights an important 
time in European history, but 
the grand scale detracts from 
the small details of everyday life 
specific to Kingsbridge books. 
The 
focus 
on 
international 

politics makes for an exciting 
and suspenseful narrative that 
is captivating in its own way. But 
because it is no longer rooted 
in labor and the middle class, 
“Column of Fire” neglects what 
makes the Kingsbridge series 
unique and dazzling in the first 
place.

Alpha Female is an attitude. It’s 

an attitude that is not perceived 
negatively, but an attitude that 
serves as a role and as a mantra for 
every alpha female. A woman may 
not even know she has this role, 
this attitude; I was fascinated by 
how the alpha female attitude can 
affect one’s mind, physical being 
and emotional state.

I did some research and talked 

to some ladies, all in pursuit of 
seeking an answer to the idea of 
how alpha female mindfulness is 
embodied — when we embody the 
energy of a certain attitude, does 
it become us? I just so happened to 
find some answers to my questions, 
and for the sake of their truthful, 
vulnerable answers, I choose to 
keep these women anonymous.

I interviewed three women 

who I believe are alpha females 
— women who I see wearing the 
attitude with pride and confidence. 
These 
women, 
however, 

interpreted their alpha-ness in 
three very different forms, and 
they explained to me how this role 
affects them in various mediums.

A 
career-focused 
busy 
bee 

reflected on her alpha-ness, and 
she feels this attitude strongest 
when she’s doing something that 
she loves.

“I feel it emotionally and 

spiritually, especially when I know 
something I have been working 
hard on by myself has payed off,” 
she said.

Nonetheless, when I asked her 

whether or not she believed she 
was an alpha female, her answer 
was surprising. She said that she 
never thought of herself as one, 
but she believed she contained 
some of the qualities that an alpha 
female possesses, like “know(ing) 
what I want and am willing to do 
whatever it takes to get there. I love 
setting difficult goals for myself 
and I am always pushing myself to 
be better.” 

While one didn’t even believe 

she was even an alpha, another 
woman didn’t discover her alpha-
ness until later in her life.

With household hardships, this 

alpha female felt as though she 
was transformed through a mix of 
a choice and a duty to become an 
alpha.

“It took me years to be 

comfortable with identifying as an 
‘alpha female,’” she told me.

At the age of nine when her 

parents divorced amid her father’s 
own internal struggles, her verbally 
abusive stepfather came into the 
picture and her younger sister 
needed protecting — her adversity 
designed her to become an alpha. 

“I didn’t identify as an alpha-

female, and didn’t believe that I 
was worthy of the praises that were 
being sung of me, because I was just 
doing what I had to, to survive,” she 
said. “Raising my sister, protecting 
her from John (stepfather), taking 
care of my dad, staying on top 
of school, and working as much 
as possible, none of that seemed 

extraordinary.”

“Whatever it was inside of 

me that sparked at age 9, and 
continues to smolder to this 
day, is what makes me an alpha-
female,” she continued. “I am 
incapable of accepting injustices 
that are happening to me, or the 
people I love ... I won’t settle for 
‘just enough,’ I can’t maintain 
superficial relationships, or accept 
anything but my all … what you 
see with me is what you get, I am 
strong, resourceful, assertive, and 
protective. I didn’t want to be a 
sad-story written by misfortune. 
I decided to create my own story, 
because I had to get out of what had 
become my reality.”

As 
explained, 
she 
believes 

that her alpha-female energy is 
strongest when “faced with a great 
challenge, or emotional/physical 
hardship … My ‘alpha-female’ is 
something that I feel emotionally 
and spiritually more than anything 
else.”

Last, but so not least, is an alpha 

who is fully conscious of her alpha 

role. When asked whether or not 
she believes in her alpha female 
attitude, she confidently answered: 
“Yes. I am a boss ass bitch and 
I don’t really follow society’s 
standards/expectations, or others 
around me.”

The youngest of four girls in her 

family, she has been surrounded by 
powerful female energy her whole 
life. She is reminded everyday of 
her alpha-ness, especially when she 
surrounds herself with other girls.

“I feel my best / strongest when 

I’m with my group of girlfriends,” 
she said. “I don’t know if it’s just 
because they all inspire me so 
much, or because they are so 
confident and loving that it reminds 
me why women are so awesome. 
We can do the impossible and it’s 
like nothing to us. I think it’s just 
the positive vibes and love that I 
receive and give back.” 

I 
interviewed 
three 
alpha 

women, three alpha women with 
three different interpretations and 
experiences of this attitude. One is 
still making her own definition of 
an alpha, another felt empowerd 
to become an alpha and there is 
one who knew of her alpha role all 
along. Regardless of how they view 
themselves, they all understand 
how this role (and how attitude and 
personality) makes such an effect 
on themselves as human beings.

These women proved to me 

that if you believe it, you can be 
it. Unfortunately, to some, this 
statement is cliché or seemingly 
impossible. 
But 
through 

spirituality, 
personal 
reflection 

(like 
meditation) 
and 
overall 

mentality, this belief is absolutely 
possible. These three women have 
discovered their alpha female-ness 
at different moments in time, but 
because they began to believe what 
they were, they owned it.

We will embody the attitudes, 

the mantras and the personalities 
we believe we are, both the positive 
and the negative ones. This leads 
me 
to 
my 
still-in-the-works 

conclusion: Any female-identifying 
person can be an alpha if they 
so choose to be. If you flaunt the 
attitude, feed the energy, believe in 
the confidence of your personality 
and prove to yourself that you have 
the power, that’s it. You’ve got it.

Mary J. Blige stars & shines
‘Mudbound’ proves to be 
a stunning familial epic

Dee Ree’s latest paints a picture of war and family in the ’40s

Dee 
Rees’s 
new 
film 

“Mudbound” tells the story of two 
families living on the Mississippi 
delta during the 1940s, one of them 
a family of white landowners, and 
the other a family of Black tenant 
farmers who work on their land. 
Memphis native Laura McAllen 
(Carey Mulligan, “The Great 
Gatsby”) is one day dragged 
by her husband, Henry (Jason 
Clarke, “Everest”), to Mississippi 
after he spontaneously decides 
to become a farmer. Henry’s 
idealized, picture perfect concept 
of farm living is quickly shattered 
as the difficult realities of rural 
southern society set in. Henry’s 
brother Jamie (Garrett Hedlund, 
“Unbroken”), meanwhile, is sent 
off to fight in World War II.

Living 
on 
the 
McAllen’s 

land is the Jackson family, 
poor tenant farmers who have 
worked on the same patch of 
land for generations. Hap (Rob 
Morgan, “Stranger Things”) and 
Florence Jackson (Mary J. Blige, 
“Betty and Coretta”) are shaken 
when their eldest son, Ronsel 
(Jason Mitchell, “Straight Outta 
Compton”), is drafted into the 
army. The film deftly compares 
the experiences of these two 
families, each one in some fashion 
reliant upon the other. Rees tells 
these stories with complete and 
total honesty, and never opts to 
embellish for the sake of the plot. 
In doing so, she crafts a depiction 
of a time period that feels so real 
and vivid that it doesn’t need 
over-the-top melodrama to draw 
audiences in. Everything about 

“Mudbound” feels real, and it 
makes the experience incredibly 
poignant.

While “Mudbound” may touch 

on issues like war and family life, 
the central point of discussion in 
the film is race relations, and it 
does an incredible job of depicting 
them. The tendency in many films 
such as “Mudbound” is to offer 
depictions of racism and race 
relations that are, for as shocking 
as the content may be, decidedly 
one-dimensional; many a period-
piece have depicted racism, but 
few dug as deep as “Mudbound.” 
The film identifies a uniquely 

American facet of society wherein 
social class is not decided by 
wealth, but rather by race. This 
is actively dichotomized with 
European society when Ronsel 
ships overseas and is shocked 
at the equitable treatment he 
receives there.

The 
film 
recognizes 
the 

unique and obsessive way that 
Americans 
think 
about 
and 

comprehend race. Rather than 
trying 
to 
pigeonhole 
racism 

as an individual phenomenon, 
“Mudbound” depicts it as a 
pillar of American society, and 
the means by which Americans 
define social power dynamics. 
The film recognizes that racism 
is more than just something 
that children are taught by their 
parents, and instead recognizes it 
as the frame of reference through 

which Americans experienced 
their whole lives during that time 
period. 

For as omnipresent as the film’s 

depictions of prejudice may be, 
Rees never seems to lose hope. 
Throughout the film, individual 
characters are shown to reach 
across lines of racial division 
through 
shared 
experiences. 

This is shown most keenly in 
the relationship between Jamie 
and Ronsel who become unlikely 
friends after the war as they 
struggle to cope with PTSD. Their 
friendship is never depicted as 
some magical cure for racism, but 
rather as a bond shared between 
individuals who have broken 
out of the social current of their 
time. While hopeful depictions 
of race relations are present, the 
film never lets audiences forget 
the glacial pace at which society 
changes, and the consequences 
that can befall individuals who 
challenge the status quo.

“Mudbound” 
is 
something 

of a slow burn; it takes its time 
getting 
audiences 
thoroughly 

immersed before striking its 
emotional climax, but when it 
arrives the result is some of the 
most 
emotionally 
impactful 

filmmaking of the year. The film 
takes viewers on an emotional 
journey 
filled 
with 
both 

bittersweet sentimentality and, 
at times, unforgivingly brutal 
harshness. Its unapologetically 
honest depiction of race relations 
make it an extremely important 
film in a modern America that still 
feels the pain of racial tensions. 
Impressing on all fronts, Dee 
Rees has created a soulful and 
impactful film that will endure 
beyond the awards season.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW
A blast from the past with 
McLaughlin and Herring 

Acclaimed guitarists performed last Friday at the Michigan Theater

This past Wednesday night, 

a diverse group of Ann Arbor 
residents 
gathered 
at 
the 

Michigan Theater to enjoy an 
evening of music by famous 
guitarists John McLaughlin 
and Jimmy Herring. Part of 
the John McLaughlin Farewell 
U.S. Tour, the performance 
at 
the 
Michigan 
Theater 

consisted of three sets.

Jimmy Herring and The 

Invisible Whip was the opening 
act, in which the guitarist 
played a variety of songs 
accompanied 
by 
musicians 

in the keyboard, drums and 
bass. John McLaughlin and 
the 4th Dimension followed 
in a similar manner, with 
McLaughlin playing songs of 
his choosing accompanied by 
the band.

The finale the guitarists 

collaborating 
on 
exciting 

jams, in which they played 
Mahavishnu 
Orchestra 

classics. This jazz-rock fusion 
style pioneered by Mahavishnu 
brought forth a calm but lively 
atmosphere. It showcased the 
talents of both guitarists while 
letting McLaughlin backtrack 
to his early works from the ’70s 
and ’80s.

Mahavishnu 
songs 
were 

crowd 
pleasers, 
but 
the 

electricity and love for this 
genre of music was especially 
felt 
during 
McLaughlin’s 

interpretation of “El Hombre 
Que Sabía,” a song he dedicated 
to 
his 
collaborator 
and 

longtime friend Paco de Lucía. 
McLaughlin explained that he 
had co-created the song with 
Paco, but Paco passed before 
the 
project 
was 
released, 

so McLaughlin reached to 
heaven and played it as a 
token of appreciation. After 
this heartfelt dedication, the 
chitchat in the crowd fell to an 
instant silence and remained 
this way until the end of the 
song, when applause filled 
every corner of the theatre.

During the performance, the 

air in the Michigan Theater was 
filled with nostalgia, applause 
and happy cries of admiration. 
Excitement was oozing from 
the floor as audience members 
struggled to stay in their seats 
during the finale. It was clear 
that the people who sat in the 
Michigan Theater that evening 
were Mahavishnu amateurs 
and John McLaughlin lovers. 
Interpretations of the music 
were shared among the crowd, 
as well as a longing for a 
seemingly impossible reunion 
of the group.

From 
beginning 
to 
end, 

Meeting of the Spirits: Music 
of 
Mahavishnu 
Orchestra 

was a head bobbing, feet 
thumping, heartfelt homage to 
John McLaughlin’s incredible 
musical career. Accompanied 
by his band members, his 
tour partner Jimmy Herring 
and an audience full of his 
biggest fans, John McLaughlin 
was able to give a stunning 
farewell performance to Ann 
Arbor residents and University 
students of all ages.

Wolverines force mistakes, ride them to upset

There were nothing but smiles 

on the faces of the Michigan 
volleyball 
team’s 
players 
as 

they 
honored 
senior 
middle 

blocker 
and 
outside 
hitters 

Claire Kieffer-Wright, Katherine 
Mahlke and Adeja Lambert on 
their senior night. 

Ending a nearly eight-year 

drought against Purdue, the 
Wolverines (9-9 Big Ten, 19-11 
overall) upset the 15th-ranked 
Boilermakers (11-7, 21-8) in the 
last home match of the season. 
In doing so, Michigan showed 
its recent season success was 
no fluke as it claimed its second 
consecutive win against a ranked 
opponent, this time in four sets.

Retaining 
the 
winning 

strategy 
they 
implemented 

against 
No. 
8 
Michigan 

State 
earlier 
in 
the 
week, 

the 
Wolverines 
emphasized 

aggression and hustle to counter 
Purdue’s imposing physicality 
and size.

“One of the things we talked 

about in our scouting of (Purdue) 
is that their team gets really 
physical and they do some 
freakish things as attackers, but 
what they don’t like is ... to get 
blocked and they don’t like to 
get dug,” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen. “As soon as they 
get blocked or as soon as they 
get dug, they make some drastic 
changes, and they try — we call 
them avoidance errors — but 
all of a sudden, they try to do 
something really different, and 
next thing you know, they’re 
making errors. I thought we did 
a good job of leading them into 
making errors.”

It was evident as early as the 

first set that Purdue could not 
find a rhythm with Michigan’s 
disruptive game plan.

Recording 20 digs and four 

team blocks, Michigan forced 
mistakes 
from 
the 
Purdue 

offense that had been otherwise 
consistent. Ranked third in the 
nation for team attack average 
with 
.316, 
the 
Boilermakers 

finished the first set with a 
percentage of .118.

Even still, Michigan failed to 

capitalize, converting only seven 
kills. Purdue eventually went on 
a 9-4 run to win the set, 25-23.

The Wolverines looked to stay 

aggressive though.

On the first play of the second 

set, junior libero Jenna Lerg 
chased a ball to the far sideline, 
before quickly withdrawing her 
arms in response to the pleas of 
her teammates.

The ball landed out of bounds.
It was another mistake by 

Purdue, and though it committed 
less of them in the second frame, 
Michigan took advantage of any 
opportunities given to it. And 
every opportunity was needed in 
the back-and-forth set.

In 
the 
end, 
the 
more 

offensively efficient Wolverines 
pulled 
through. 
Michigan 

finished with 18 kills on a .342 
attack percentage and 18 assists, 
more than doubling the offensive 
numbers from the initial set to 
win the second set, 25-22.

The set was highlighted by 

junior and sophomore outside 
hitters Carly Skjodt and Sydney 
Wetterstrom, 
respectively. 

Skjodt had six kills off nine 
attempts while recording a set-

high seven digs. She ended the 
game with 16 kills and 16 digs, 
her seventh double-double of the 
season.

Wetterstrom had five kills in 

the set, with two coming at the 
end, where she scored back-to-
back points to clinch the frame. 
She ended the game with 12 kills 
and four digs.

The third set came in runs. 

Michigan started with a 4-1 run, 
allowing Purdue to score off of 
an error by redshirt sophomore 
middle blocker Cori Crocker. 
However, 
the 
Boilermakers 

quickly answered with a 3-0 run 
to tie the game.

Despite the third set being the 

cleanest error-wise for Purdue — 
it committed just five attacking 
errors and one serving error — 
they were made at the costliest 
times. Michigan capped off the 
frame on a 3-0 run with two of 
the last three points coming from 
errors committed by Purdue.

The dynamic between Mahlke 

and sophomore setter Mackenzie 
Welsh was evident in the fourth 
set. Recognizing Mahlke had the 
hot hand, Welsh found her early, 
allowing her to score back-to-

back points to set the tone for the 
frame.

Down 13-6, Purdue mounted 

a comeback, going on a run to tie 
the game at 18.

But 
Mahlke 
scored 
three 

straight points for the Wolverines 
out of a Michigan timeout before 
the Boilermakers ended the set 
with three straight errors.

“She’s just got such a live arm,” 

Rosen said. “She swings fast and 
high when she gets going. And I 
thought (Welsh) did a great job 
of using her at the right time, 
really, managing her hitters. And 
(Mahlke) was just delivering. I 
thought (Mahlke) was just super 
relentless tonight; she was just 
going after it. That’s just how she 
approached the match tonight; 
she was just going after it.”

Mahlke ended the game with 

14 kills on .500 attack percentage, 
leading the game in efficiency.

Despite putting up a fight, 

Purdue’s errors proved too much 
to overcome, committing a total 
of 33 attacking errors and nine 
service errors. Michigan, not 
taking any point for granted, 
took the opportunity at hand as 
it sent off its seniors with a win.

VOLLEYBALL
‘M’ seniors exorcise 
demons, top Purdue

Beat Purdue. 
That 
is 
something 
the 

senior class of the Michigan 
volleyball team, and several 
before it, haven’t been able to 
do.

“We talked about it,” said 

coach 
Mark 
Rosen. 
“We 

don’t have a lot of secrets in 
our program, we don’t skirt 
around things. We haven’t beat 
them since 2010. I asked them, 
‘where were you guys in 2010?’ 
and a lot of them were in sixth 
grade. So it’s a long time ago.”

But 
the 
streak 
finally 

ended Saturday night, as the 
Wolverines 
disposed of No. 
15 Purdue in 
four sets. The 
three seniors — 
outside 
hitter 

Adeja Lambert, 
middle blocker 
Claire Kieffer-
Wright 
and 

opposite hitter 
Katherine 
Mahlke — all 
contributed immensely to the 
win in their final game at Cliff 
Keen Arena.

Lambert finished with seven 

digs, while Kieffer-Wright had 
7.5 points and ended a few 
long volleys with pivotal kills. 
Offensively, Mahlke led the 
way, finishing the game with 
a team-high 14 kills and a .500 
hit percentage.

“Kat really came out with 

some major kills when we 
needed them,” said junior 
outside hitter Carly Skjodt. 
“She stayed aggressive the 
entire match.”

Added Rosen; “She just has 

such a live arm. She swings 
fast and high when she gets 
going. Kat was just delivering, 
and one of (the) things we 
talked about against a team 
that big and that physical was 
you have to be aggressive.

“If you flinch or pull back a 

little bit on your swing, they’re 
going to block you. I thought 
Kat was just super relentless 
and going after it.”

That aggressive play paid 

off for the Wolverines, as the 
senior class capped off an 
impressive home record of 
49-16. Michigan will certainly 
miss the leadership and play 
of Lambert, Kieffer-Wright, 
and Mahlke next season, as 
they have all been regular 
contributors 
since 
their 

freshman years.

“You don’t know what you 

miss until you don’t have it,” 
Rosen said. “We know we’re 
going to miss a lot, but we 
won’t know the specifics until 

they’re not here. 
And we’re not 
really in a hurry 
to figure that 
out. We want to 
make this go as 
long as possible, 
and enjoy their 
experience 
here.”

It’s 
an 

experience that 
may last a little 

longer, as the Wolverines — 
who finish up the regular 
season with two away games — 
seem to have clinched a spot in 
the NCAA Tournament after 
Friday’s result and a victory 
over No. 8 Michigan State on 
Wednesday.

But 
regardless 
of 
their 

postseason fate, the seniors 
can rest easier knowing that 
they closed out their home 
careers with a win against a 
formidable foe in front of a 
sold-out crowd.

“I say this every year, but 

this is my least favorite night,” 
Rosen said. “I mean, we beat 
Purdue, that’s great, but it’s 
just hard to say goodbye to 
those guys. Four years go by so 
fast and it never feels like it’s 
enough time. And I guess that 
that’s a good thing. The year we 
want our seniors to graduate, 
that’s probably a bad sign.”

Michigan finishes in top-10 at NCAA Championships

The six fifth-year seniors on 

the Michigan men’s cross country 
team had careers defined by ups 
and downs. In their freshman 
and sophomore seasons, the 
Wolverines finished ninth and 
11th in the nation.

But last year, Michigan failed 

to even qualify for a spot in the 
NCAA National Championship 
race. 

Coming into this year, it wanted 

to regain some consistency.

Thanks in large part to those 

fifth-year seniors, the Wolverines 
returned to churning out strong, 
consistent 
performances, 

culminating in a 10th-place finish 
at the NCAA Championships in 
Louisville.

Michigan ended the race with 

the best finish of any Big Ten 
team, scoring 328 points — 254 
points behind national champion 
Northern 
Arizona. 
Fifth-year 

senior Ben Flanagan led the 
Wolverines by finishing 20th 
overall, ending an excellent senior 
season in which he was named 
the Great Lakes Region Athlete of 
the Year by becoming Michigan’s 
first All-American since 2014.

“He’s got a fierce desire to 

win,” said Michigan coach Mike 
Sullivan. “And he’s a guy who’s 
not really satisfied with anything 
less than being on the podium.”

Fellow 
fifth-year 
senior 

Connor Mora also turned in an 
excellent 
final 
performance, 

finishing 48th — just eight spots 
out of All-American qualification. 
In the final two kilometers, he 
maneuvered past seven runners. 
He was one of several Wolverines 
to move up the field toward the 
end of the race, as both redshirt 
senior 
Aaron 
Baumgarten 

methodically brushed past 61 
runners and freshman Jack Aho 
moved up 15 spots over the last 

four kilometers.

“For us, it was just about 

being cautiously aggressive at 
the beginning and then trying to 
find a good spot to work up from 
through the race,” Sullivan said. 
“We didn’t plan much besides to 
get out hard, and try to race from 
5k onwards.”

Michigan’s 

strong 
performance 
in 

their final race 
of 
the 
season 

can 
partially 

be 
attributed 

to the excellent 
leadership 
of 

its six redshirt 
seniors.

“I think (senior leadership) was 

really important in a situation 
like today for a couple reasons,” 
Sullivan said. “We were relying on 
some freshmen and sophomores 
that have never been at this stage 

before and those guys had the 
experience to kind of walk them 
through it, walk them through 
the emotions leading up to the 
race. That type of leadership 
is gonna help us as the seniors 
graduate and our younger guys 
take over the leadership roles.”

With the massive senior class 

graduating, 
the 
burden 
of 

leadership 
will 

likely rest on Jack 
Aho and redshirt 
freshman 
Isaac 

Harding, 
who 

rounded 
out 

the 
Wolverines 

scoring five with 

a finish of 132nd at nationals.

After failing to qualify for 

nationals last year, Michigan’s 
strong top-10 finish was certainly 
a satisfying end for its fifth-year 
seniors, who were able to close 
out their careers on an upswing.

The No. 8 Michigan women’s 

cross country team crossed the 
finish line of its season Saturday, 
finishing ninth at the NCAA Cross 
Country Championships with 295 
points.

In the 31-team competition, 

fifth-year 
seniors 
and 
All-

Americans 
Jamie 
Morrissey 

and Gina Sereno anchored the 
Wolverines, both finishing in the 
top-30 individually in the tight 
six-kilometer race. For the third 
year in a row, the Wolverines 
finished as one of the event’s top-
10 finishers, ending the race just 
ahead of Wisconsin, and only 31 
points behind sixth-place Boise 
State.

“They 
were 
inspired 
and 

focused all year,” said Michigan 
coach Mike McGuire. “I think we 

set out and achieved most of our 
goals. You can set goals and work 
to those goals and we did that all 
year. They displayed a good work 
ethic and were there for each 
other throughout the year.”

Next 
year, 
Michigan 
will 

lose 
its 
two 
All-Americans. 

Without 
the 

dynamic duo, the 
Wolverines will 
miss a steadily 
improved runner 
in 
Morrissey 

and one of the 
best runners in 
program history 
in 
Sereno. 

Sereno specifically ran strong in 
the beginning, hitting the two-
kilometer mark in the leaders’ 
pack, but gradually drifting to a 
27th-place finish.

For the duration of the race, 

the Wolverines’ fate was not in 

doubt, due in large part to the 
underclassmen 
on 
the 
team. 

Michigan started the race seventh, 
fell to eighth at the four-kilometer 
mark, and ended ninth. Junior 
Claire Borchers and sophomore 
Madeline Trevisian both placed in 
the top-100 of the race and should 

be 
in 
prime 

position 
to 
be 

key contributors 
on 
the 
team, 

along with other 
familiar faces and 
new blood.

“We’ll 
have 

several 
athletes 

that ran this meet 

that will be returning next year, 
so this will be a great growing 
experience,” McGuire said. “With 
graduating our first two runners 
as fifth-year seniors, someone 
has to assume the new role. That 
(search) will begin tomorrow.

“We got a solid season from 

Maddie 
and 
(junior) 
Avery 

Evenson, and Claire was hugely 
improved over last year. Haley 
Meier, a fifth-year senior who is 
eligible for a 6th year, has shown 
a lot of growth. … We got some 
people who are waiting in the 
wing and some incoming people 
too.”

Each runner will continue to 

develop over the winter, and many 
of the cross country runners will 
compete in the indoor track season, 
trying to sustain Michigan’s streak 
of top-10 finishes.

“The strength is depth and 

the weakness, which we hope 
to address and resolve through 
growth, is that at this level, we 
don’t have an established front-
runner,” McGuire said. “That’s 
going to be the biggest question 
moving forward.”

With a new recruiting class 

and continued growth, Michigan 
should find an answer to that 
question soon.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Katelynn Flaherty 
sets scoring record

Every day after the Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
team 

finishes 
practice, 
Katelynn 

Flaherty stays on the court and 
takes 1,000 extra shots.

“I’m like, ‘Katelynn, we just 

had a three-hour practice,’ ” 
said junior center Hallie Thome 
at the team’s Media Day. “But 
no, it’s Katelynn. I mean, it 
speaks to her.”

Flaherty’s work paid off last 

Thursday, when she passed 
Diane Dietz – who had held 
the record since 1982 – as the 
program’s 
all-time 
leading 

scorer in just the third game of 
her senior year. Coming into the 
season, this was 
an inevitability, 
but 
Flaherty 

blitzed to the 
finish. She not 
only 
averaged 

24 points per 
game over the 
Wolverines’ first 
three contests, 
but on Thursday 
– 
just 
nine 

points from the 
record – Flaherty came out and 
nailed her first three 3-pointers 
of the night.

A few minutes later, she hit 

a fourth for good measure. She 
isn’t the type to leave things 
unfinished.

“The record was not on my 

mind,” she said Monday. “I was 
just kind of taking what was 
wide open and I just knew that’s 
what we needed to do to score 
and get points on the board. 
And usually I don’t get looks 
like that right away, so I just felt 
good taking them.”

In the heat of the game, there 

wasn’t even time for it to sink 
in. Michigan was scrambling to 
keep up with No. 5 Louisville, a 
task the Wolverines ultimately 

weren’t up to as the Cardinals 
pulled away late to win 74-49.

“But 
after 
the 
game 
it 

definitely set in,” Flaherty said. 
“And it was pretty cool just to 
reflect on past years and think 
about it.”

Added coach Kim Barnes 

Arico to WTKA after the game 
last Thursday: “I had heard 
about Katelynn since she had 
been in the third grade. We 
lived in the same state and it 
was going around that there 
was this third grader who was 
going to be special. And now 
here I am today, she was eight 
then and 22 now, and I am just 
lucky to be her coach.”

Now, when Flaherty walks 

into Crisler Center and looks 

up 
into 
the 

rafters, behind 
the 
basket 

where Michigan 
hangs its retired 
numbers, 
it 

comes with the 
realization that 
her #3 will likely 
join Bill Buntin, 
Cazzie Russell, 
Phil 
Hubbard, 

Glen Rice, and 

Rudy Tomjanovich. Flaherty 
would be the first women’s 
basketball player to join that 
club, but it’s hard to imagine a 
reason why it wouldn’t happen.

“It’s just crazy to think 

about,” Flaherty said. “Even 
just thinking when I walk in the 
gym, I’m the all-time leading 
scorer on the women’s side, and 
I think that’s just crazy and 
still doesn’t feel real as of right 
now.”

With the Wolverines looking 

at their best chance to make 
the NCAA Tournament since 
Flaherty has been in Ann Arbor, 
don’t expect her to slow down 
this season. After all, practice 
is over and there are still 1,000 
shots left to take.

ICE HOCKEY
Michigan’s resiliency 
on display in 1-1 series

“Another gritty character 

performance by our players.”

That was how Michigan 

coach Mel Pearson categorized 
his 
team’s 
play 
against 

Wisconsin on Saturday.

Such has been the storyline 

for the majority of the season 
– a firm Wolverine front that 
comes from behind and gives 
its opponents no reason to feel 
comfortable.

Sophomore forwards Jake 

Slaker 
and 
Nick 
Pastujov 

epitomized 
that 
storyline 

Saturday, 
tallying 
two 

comeback goals in the third 
period against No. 9 Wisconsin.

The two drove down the slot 

and 
delivered 

perfectly timed 
wrist shots that 
stunned 
the 

crowd and the 
Wolverines’ 
bench 
in 

Madison.

The 
No. 

17 
Michigan 

hockey 
team 

(2-2-2-1 
Big 

Ten, 
6-4-2 

overall) is no stranger to that 
type of performance.

Against 
Vermont, 

sophomore 
forward 
Adam 

Winborg equalized in the first 
period after an embarrassing 
1-0 deficit. Against Penn State, 
despite the series-opening loss, 
senior forward Dexter Dancs 
and junior forward Cooper 
Marody 
netted 
come-from-

behind goals in the second and 
third periods, respectively, that 
did not end up being enough.

An onslaught of six come-

from-behind 
goals 
in 
the 

Wolverines’ tie to Minnesota 
displayed 
this 
resiliency 

again despite how the Golden 
Gophers 
prevailed 
in 
a 

shootout.

“They continue to battle,” 

Pearson said. “And that’s what 
I really appreciate about this 

team is they stay with it.”

Added 
Calderone 
after 

Michigan’s shutout win over 
Wisconsin: “I think we showed 
resilience 
again. 
It’s 
been 

a common theme this year, 
but I think we like to not put 
ourselves in that situation so 
it’s something that we ought 
to work on, but once again we 
came back and that was huge.”

However, as evident by the 

four goals that the Badgers 
netted in the first and second 
periods Friday night, late-game 
efforts sometimes aren’t not 
enough.

A common thread, even in 

tough situations like Friday’s 
loss to Wisconsin, is that the 
players – and Pearson – believe 
that grit is consistently present.

In a weekend 

that 
was 
full 

of 
defensive 

lapses, 
some 

of the players 
saw that there 
could have been 
improvements 
in 
communication.

“You 

just 
have 
to 

compete,” 

Marody said. “You have good 
communication 
with 
the 

defensemen, have good support 
on the pucks in the scrum.

“We 
definitely 
have 
to 

tighten up some stuff, and 
we’re gonna work hard in 
practice this week to do that.”

This is the fourth time that 

Michigan has split a weekend 
series, but banking on late goals 
from the likes of Calderone, 
Marody and Dancs has become 
commonplace.

Facing off against two of 

the best teams in the Big Ten 
in Minnesota and Wisconsin 
already, 
the 
battle-tested 

Wolverines have a culture of 
resolve when it counts.

Going 
forward, 
that 

steadfastness should be able 
to 
steamroll 
lower 
caliber 

opponents.

Another gritty 

character 

performance by 

our players

ROBERT HEFTER

That’s just 

crazy and still 
doesn’t feel real 
as of right now

With history in the rivalry, McCray 
to lead Michigan against Ohio State

Mike McCray grew up an 

Ohio State fan. 

As the son of former Buckeye 

captain Mike McCray, Sr., his 
allegiance made sense.

But 
now, 
the 
fifth-year 

senior linebacker is a captain 
for the Michigan football team. 
And Monday, his final week 
of preparation for ‘The Game’ 
began.

According to McCray, his 

father is now committed to the 
Wolverines as well.

“He’s rooting for us, so 

that’s all that really matters,” 
McCray said. “We have a great 
relationship. ... He’s cheering 
for us every weekend, so he 
doesn’t really care about Ohio 
State right now.”

McCray Sr. may accept that 

his son is a ‘Michigan Man’ 
now, but he was initially caught 
off guard by his son’s interest in 
the program he used to regard 
only as “that team up north.”

McCray initially visited the 

Wolverines in September of 
2012 at the first night game in 
Michigan Stadium history. The 
Wolverines may have fallen 
to Notre Dame, but McCray 
returned home to Ohio with a 
collection of Michigan gear.

“(My dad) was like, ‘What’s 

going on?’ I just told him I really 
liked it,” McCray said. “He was 
a little surprised because it 
was my first time ever being up 
here. It kind of shocked him a 
little bit, but overall he was just 
happy for me.”

McCray admitted Monday 

that he never hated Michigan. 
Even though his father did, 
McCray Sr. quickly changed 
his mind about the Wolverines 
when his son decided that is 
where he wanted to spend four 
years of his life.

McCray is in the midst of his 

fifth. He needed one more to 
accomplish his goal of becoming 
a captain at Michigan. He may 
not have followed in his father’s 
footsteps in Columbus, but he 
still did in Ann Arbor.

“It sunk in the day that I got 

voted captain,” McCray said. “...
It was just one of those moments 
(that) was kind of surreal. I 
don’t know too many people 
to ever have the opportunity 
— him being a captain at Ohio 
State and me being the captain 
here. It’s one of those things 
you can’t take for granted.”

Throughout 
his 
career, 

McCray’s father has been by his 
side. He records the Wolverines’ 
games and evaluates his son’s 
play. He offers his advice to 
prepare for each game, and 
now that his son is a captain, he 
provides tips for him to help his 
teammates succeed as well.

“Ever since I committed, he 

was all in,” McCray said. “He’s 
a big supporter of me and a 
big supporter of our team, so I 
thank him for that. Probably 
after this game and the bowl 
game, he’ll go back over to the 
dark side.”

Saturday, McCray will be 

leading Michigan down the 
tunnel and onto the field for 
the final Ohio State game of 
his career. He has never beaten 
the Buckeyes. None of the 
Wolverines have.

Michigan has lost to Ohio 

State 12 times in its past 13 tries. 
The Wolverines are eager to 
reverse that streak, especially 
in light of the dramatic nature 
of last season’s overtime loss. 
McCray is especially motivated 
to secure his first victory over 
the Buckeyes. 

“In 
my 
eyes, 
it’s 
really 

important,” he said. “I don’t 
want to go back home and hear, 
‘Oh, you never beat Ohio State 
while you were up there.’ ”

McCray 
understands 
that 

this is his final chance to 
make a mark on arguably the 
most historic rivalry in college 
football. He and his father may 
have been on different sides of 
the rivalry during their college 
careers, but Saturday, McCray 
Sr. will be cheering on his son 
against his former team one 
more time.

“It’s my last game at the Big 

House, and it’s my last time 
being able to try to beat Ohio 
State since I’ve been here,” 
McCray said. “Everybody here 
hasn’t beaten them, so it’d be a 
great memory to have if we win.”

Even McCray Sr. would likely 

smile if his son and his team 
managed to pull off the feat.

Changing his legacy

Y

ou could forget all 
about the humiliation 
and the wrenching 

losses and all the interceptions 
and missed passes in between.

You could forget the way 

Michigan’s season turned for 
the worse against Michigan 
State, the 
way it 
squeaked 
past 
Indiana, 
and the 
way it got 
trounced 
in Happy 
Valley.

You 

could 
forget all about how a transfer 
quarterback from Houston 
lost back-to-back position 
battles. And you could toss 
away the memories of how 
that fifth-year senior only 
played when his superior got 
injured, and how he lost the 
job to a redshirt freshman 
anyway.

John O’Korn could wipe 

away all his critics, remold his 
legacy, and go from zero to 
hero in a heartbeat…

He just has to beat Ohio 

State.

Welp.
On Monday, Michigan coach 

Jim Harbaugh said redshirt 
freshman Brandon Peters was 
going through the concussion 
protocol for a hit he took 
against Wisconsin. Harbaugh 
said Peters was making 
progress, but he still has to go 
through medical assessments 
before he even gets the chance 
to practice without contact.

Michigan’s other 

quarterback, Wilton Speight, 
began practicing without 
contact last week after a 
shoulder injury he suffered in 
September, but it’s difficult to 
imagine either him or Peters 
ready to play this weekend.

Without those two, the 

weight shifts onto O’Korn’s 
shoulders. An upset, though, 
obviously would take more 

than just a career game from 
the quarterback.

A lot needs to happen for 

the Wolverines to beat the 
eighth-ranked Buckeyes.

Michigan’s defense needs 

to shut down quarterback J.T. 
Barrett, and it needs to keep 
running backs J.K. Dobbins 
and Mike Weber in check. The 
Wolverines’ run game also 
needs more from junior Karan 
Higdon and sophomore Chris 
Evans. The offensive and the 
defensive lines must hammer 
down against one of the most 
physical teams in the country.

But no matter what happens 

elsewhere on the field, no 
single player has more on the 
line than O’Korn.

It was O’Korn who threw 

three interceptions in the rain 
against the Spartans, and it 
was O’Korn who couldn’t pass 
for more than 60 yards against 
the Hoosiers.

When O’Korn has struggled, 

so has the team. When he has 
excelled, it has only been for 
one or two plays at a time. 
Michigan fans have yet to see 
the same O’Korn that Houston 
witnessed in 2013.

Imagine a season where he 

threw for over 3,000 yards, 
28 touchdowns and won his 
conference’s Rookie of the 
Year award. He did all that as 
a freshman for the Cougars, 
yet he hasn’t done the same in 
Ann Arbor.

He has been the Wolverines’ 

backup quarterback since he 
arrived, but there is one thing 
he shares in common with all 
those quarterbacks who have 
played while he’s been on the 
bench.

None of them ever beat 

Ohio State. No Michigan 
quarterback has in five years.

Jake Rudock never did it, 

and Wilton Speight couldn’t 

do it after him. Devin Gardner 
played Ohio State three times, 
and he never won in the 
rivalry game either.

The last quarterback to beat 

Ohio State was dual-threat, 
fan-favorite Denard Robinson. 
In 2011, the Wolverines beat 
Ohio State, 40-34. In that 
game, Robinson threw for 
167 yards, passed for three 
touchdowns, rushed for 
170 yards and ran for two 
touchdowns.

A performance like that 

from O’Korn is obviously not 
very likely.

Honestly, calling it 

impossible wouldn’t be far-
fetched.

Nobody expects much 

from John O’Korn, and that’s 
exactly why an upset win 
would change so, so much.
