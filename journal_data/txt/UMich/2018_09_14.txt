The University of Michigan’s 

chapter of College Democrats, 
along with the Michigan State 
University 
chapter 
and 
the 

Michigan Federation of College 
Democrats, is suing the state over 
two of its voter ID and registration 
laws. The suit claims the laws 
unconstitutionally 
restrict 
a 

citizen’s 26th Amendment right 
to vote, particularly for young 
voters and students.

The 
suit 
concerns 
two 

laws, 
Michigan 
Public 
Act 

118 and Michigan Compiled 
Laws 168.509t(2), which the 
organizations 
claim 
make 

voting 
more 
difficult 
and 

time-consuming and in turn, 
discourage voters from casting 

their ballots.

Public Act 118 requires the 

voter’s residence on their voter 
registration 
card 
to 
match 

their residence on their driver’s 
license. The Michigan Compiled 
Laws statute requires voters who 
register through a third party or 
by mail to vote in-person for their 
first-time vote.

According to a press release by 

the plaintiffs, the complaint was 
filed by Perkins Coie LLP and 
MSU law professor Mark Totten 
and outlined the claims from 
College Democrats alleging the 
laws add to the general confusion 
about voting and discourage 
young voters.

“(Y)oung voters in Michigan 

have 
faced 
unequal 
and 

consequential 
barriers 
in 

registering to vote and voting

Dozens of former customers accuse owner of white supremacy, sexual harrassment

Now that Ann Arbor business 

Pangea Piercing has officially closed 
its doors for good –– the result of a 

massive outcry against the behavior 
of owner J.C. Potts, which many say 
constitutes abuse, sexism, and white 
supremacy –– community members 
are thinking about how best to fill 
now-empty space, and ensure that 
Potts is not able to continue his 
piercing career elsewhere.

After an August 21st tweet from 

user @LauraStroudd went viral, 
describing a situation in which 
Potts 
repeated 
several 
white 

supremacist talking points to her 
during a piercing, Alice Held, 
another previous customer, shared 
her own experiences with Potts, 
as well as similar experiences of 
over 30 others she had collected. 

Complaints 
range 
from 
racist, 

sexist and transphobic comments to 
sexual harassment while customers 
were getting piercings. Many others 
expressed their concerns with the 
safety and professionalism of the 
process, mentioning scarring and 
pain. During one piercing, Held

After a summer of meetings 

with the Office of Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs and 

various 
University 
officials 

and departments, the Latinx 
Alliance 
for 
Community 

Action, Support and Advocacy 
and 
MESA 
representatives 

say progress has been made 
on short-term requests and 

conversations 
about 
larger, 

institutional 
demands 
are 

moving in the right direction. 
Last 
February, 
La 
Casa 

sent a list of demands to 
the University of Michigan 
administration 
addressing 

a 
lack 
of 
representation 

and support for the Latinx 
community on campus.

La Casa, an organization 

of students and faculty at the 
University, works to provide 
support and facilitate a positive 
environment for all Latinx 
students on campus looking for 
more support.

La Casa’s demands, which 

were 
emailed 
directly 
to 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, 
Provost 
Martin 

Philbert and others, called 
specifically for an increase in 
Latinx staff and faculty hires, 
Latinx senior administration 
hires, additional funding for 
the Latina/o Studies program 
and La Casa, the installment 
of Latinx-identified spaces on 
campus and more.

Though 
little 
concrete 

progress has been made on 
the larger demands including 
structural 
diversification 
of 

hiring processes to include 
more 
Latinx 
hirees 
and

contract expired May 29, 
and an agreement on a new 
contract was made June 22. 
The new contract went into 
effect in July.

The 
new 
contract 

comes 
after 
eight 

months 
of 
bargaining 

negotiations 
with 
the 

University. 
LEO’s 
efforts 

sparked 
support 
from 

students across the three 
campuses, and they also 
resulted in a vote to strike in 
April. LEO eventually called 
off 
the 
strike 
after 
an 

agreement was made with 
the 
University 
regarding 

salary increases.

LEO 
President 
Ian 

Robinson, 
a 
sociology 

lecturer, said that though 
LEO did not get everything 
it 
had 
asked 
for, 
the 

negotiations were overall 
successful.

“It’s a terrific contract,” 

Robinson 
said. 
“It 
fell 

short in a couple of areas, 
but compared to where we 
were coming from (with) 
the baseline before this 
contract, it’s terrific.”

According to LEO’s blog, 

the organization believes 
this 
contract 
agreement 

is a historic victory for its 
members and allies.

“We believe that we have 

won historic gains in these 
negotiations, 
including 

significant salary increases, 
improved 
benefits, 
and 

stronger 
protections 
for 

Lecturer 
job 
security,” 

LEO’s 
bargaining 
team 

wrote in the post.

By 2021, the contract 

minimum 
salary 
will 

increase by $16,500 in Ann 
Arbor, $13,700 in Flint 
and $12,700 in Dearborn. 
Equity 
adjustments, 
or 

one-time additions to base 
pay, would also increase by 
$3,000 to $12,500. Equity 
will differ for lecturers 
earning more than $80,000 
annually.

for the first time,” the complaint 
read. “Indeed, in many cases, these 
laws have resulted in a chilling 
effect that has kept eligible young 
voters in Michigan from voting 
and registering to vote entirely 
due to widespread confusion about 
the laws’ requirements and legal 
effects.”

Marc Elias, a partner at Perkins 

Coie, is one of the plaintiff’s 
lawyers. Elias, who served as 
general counsel to Hillary Clinton’s 
2016 presidential campaign, also 
represented a group of college 
students 
in 
Florida 
in 
their 

successful suit to remove a ban on 
early voting on college campuses. It 
was the first time a judge ruled that 
a policy constituted discrimination 
under the 26th Amendment.

Ingham County Clerk Barb 

Byrum supported the plaintiffs 
in the suit, declaring in a press 
release Michigan has “some of the 
toughest and unnecessary voting 

restrictions in the country.”

“These restrictions have had a 

devastating impact on the ability 
of students voters to exercise 
their right to vote for more than a 
decade,” Byrum wrote.

MSU student Eli Pales, president 

of 
MSU’s 
College 
Democrats, 

addressed specific ways the suit 
files believe the aforementioned 
laws negatively impact voters on 
their campus. Pales said the “First 
Time/In-Person 
Requirement” 

directly inhibits students who 
moved long distances to attend 
MSU from voting in their home 
precincts.

“This is obviously a huge 

detriment to a lot of students who 
registered at home, maybe at a 
high school registration drive or 
whatever it is, come to Michigan 
State University and can’t vote 
unless they drive home,” Pales 
said. “Here at Michigan State 
University, for the first year, you’re 
not allowed to have a car on campus 
which essentially means if you’re 
registered at home and you need to 
get home to vote, you need a parent 

to come to the University, pick you 
up, bring you back to vote, and then 
drop you back off which would take 
hours and hours of a parent’s day.”

Public 
Policy 
senior 
Kellie 

Lounds, 
president 
of 
U-M’s 

College Democrats, agreed, adding 
that in addition to the logistical 
hurdles the laws placed in the 
way of student voters, they made 
the 
process 
confusing, 
which 

ultimately discourages voting.

“I myself have encountered 

complications while registering 
voters in seeing other students 
be unsure as to whether they 
can actually register with their 
campus addresses and what the 
consequences of changing their 
driver’s 
license 
address 
are,” 

Lounds wrote in an email to 
The Daily. “It’s a fairly common 
confusion and this law makes it 
unnecessarily complex for students 
to exercise their right to vote.”

will be prepared for key senior 
roles in a variety of governmental 
institutions and public agencies, 
in the non-public sector and in the 
private sector as well.”

The 33-credit degree will be 

open to individuals with five or 
more years of experience in public 
administration, government affairs, 
the military or the nonprofit sector. 
The Public Policy School has 
developed new courses specifically 
for this program, in addition, these 
MPA students will enroll in courses 
which are part of the school’s 
current Master of Public Policy 
program, including Economics for 
Public Affairs and Leadership in 
Public Affairs. In order to complete 
the degree, students must also 
complete a capstone project for a 
client. The new program builds 
upon the former Master of Public 
Administration 
by 
combining 

the previous degree’s focus on 
analytical policy analysis with 

new curriculums for public and 
nonprofit entity management.

This 
curriculum, 
combined 

with a faculty of experts in fields 
ranging from economics to social 
work, will focus on refining the 
skills of professionals in the field 
and prepare them for leadership 
positions within and outside of the 
government. 

“The new degree program builds 

upon the strengths of the Master 
of Public Administration degree 
while providing some new and 
innovative learning opportunities 
that are tailored to experienced 
professionals,” Barr wrote. “We are 
grateful to our alumni of the Master 
of Public Administration degree for 
their input as we develop this new 
program.”

Paula 
Lantz, 
professor 
and 

associate dean for academic affairs 
at the Public Policy School, said 
the school decided to update their 
program to strengthen it and 
broaden their reach to domestic and 
international students.

“The impetus behind this new 

degree was the desire to strengthen 

our reduced-credit master’s degree 
offering for people with significant 
work experience,” Lantz said. “We 
are very excited about this new 
degree offering, which we believe 
will attract people with work 
experience and an interest in public 
affairs around the world.”

Lantz 
explained 
the 
new 

program has the potential to expand 
into an executive learning format.

“Eventually we are going to 

take this degree into an executive 
format which will combine online 
and in-person learning,” Lantz 
said. “In the future, it will also be 
in an executive format and will be 
available to people working full-
time.”

Lantz said though this program 

is one of at least seven other Master 
of Public Administration degrees in 
Michigan, the Public Policy School 
will be the only Master of Public 
Affairs in Michigan and one of few 
in the country.

said Potts made reference to her 
breasts, saying she was “blessed,” 
and used the N-word. In an earlier 
instance, when she was 14, Held 
said Potts prohibited her father 
from being present in the room 
during a piercing, though nothing 
else inappropriate occurred.

“I’m very involved in the body 

modification 
community 
in 

general, and I want that to be a very 
safe place, and it’s not with this guy 
being in business,” Held said. “So, 
my biggest goal is I obviously don’t 
want him to be piercing in Ann 
Arbor or anywhere, so making 
sure –– keeping tabs on where he 
goes next is probably my biggest 
thing that I wanna focus on.”

University doctorate student 

Abby Lamb also said he brought 
up 
topics 
she 
considered 

inappropriate 
during 
the 

procedure.

“JC started out with polite, 

normal small talk about my 
work,” Lamb said. “But as soon 
as he discovered I’m a genetics 
researcher he started going on 
about ‘the genetic correlation 
between aggression and skin 
pigment,’ which is complete non-
scientific nonsense peddled by 
white supremacists to justify their 
views.”

Lamb emphasized Potts put her 

in a “creepy and uncomfortable 
situation,” 
where 
she 
didn’t 

feel like she could respond to or 
challenge his beliefs.

“He was in the process of 

changing 
my 
piercing 
when 

this came up, and I didn’t feel 
comfortable or safe objecting 
while he was handling my facial 
piercing,” Lamb explained. “He 
basically took advantage of my 
vulnerability and his position of 
relative power to both mansplain 
my field of research to me while 
trying to preach that dark skinned 
people are naturally violent.”

Following 
the 
viral 
posts, 

protesters showed up at Pangea 
Piercing 
with 
printed 
copies 

of victim statements and signs 
accusing Potts of being a Nazi. Potts 
then posted a video statement to 

Pangea Piercing’s official Youtube 
channel defending his views and 
announcing the business’s closing.

“I’ve talked about challenging 

topics and for the ultra-sensitive 
activist types, I’m sure that I 
can sound like some ‘Trumpian’ 
figure,” Potts said in his statement. 
“With a little twist and some 
embellishment, it might finally be 
the ‘actual racism’ that Ann Arbor 
has been so desperately searching 
for.”

Since Potts confirmed the 

business would be closing, Jessica 
Prozinski, 
a 
founder 
of 
the 

grassroots activist organization 
Stop Trump Ann Arbor, has talked 
with people from local businesses 
like Gamma Piercing and Eternal 
Ink about opening a new piercing 
gallery or tattoo parlor in the 
space.

“Initially I was thinking it 

would be cool if it was another 
piercing place with an owner that 
would be almost the reverse,” 
Prozinski said. “Obviously we 
don’t have the legal power to 
decide what goes next there, but 
socially we have a lot of power.”

Stop Trump Ann Arbor is 

also proposing additions to the 
Association 
of 
Professional 

Piercers’ “Piercee’s Bill of Rights,” 
which would assert that people 
undergoing piercing procedures 
have the right to not be sexualized 
or otherwise objectified in the 
piercing environment, and to have 
a friend or relative present in the 
same room during the piercing.

 “The person I talked to was 

shocked that J.C. discouraged 
people from having somebody 
come into the piercing room with 
them, including, in at least two 
cases, minor women,” Prozinski 
said.

According to Potts, his own 

career “is over.” In his video 
statement, 
however, 
Potts 

indicated 
he 
would 
continue 

posting videos to Youtube to 
discuss the topics surrounding his 
allegations.

“I’ve said quite a few times 

that I wish we, as white people, 
could ever have anything like 
representation for our interests 
that wasn’t Richard Spencer or 
David Duke,” he said. “Well, my 
career is over, so I will not be 

bringing you any more piercing 
content, but seeing as how I guess 
some of these conversations need 
to happen, then I guess we’ll be 
probably checking in with more 
videos in the future, just definitely 
not on this channel.”

Prozinski said the video made 

her worry Potts might try to turn 
himself “into some sort of white 
nationalist figure.”

Potts 
has 
also 
threatened 

legal action against some of the 
customers who have made claims 
against him, though Prozinski and 
Held don’t believe the threats are 
serious. Replying to the original 
viral tweet, Held posted an eight-
second video sent to her by another 
customer, in which Potts can 
be heard saying, “A lot of really 
powerful folks out there doing 
what they can to convince white 
folks not to breed. Okay? And if 
they do, breed with a black man…”

In response, Potts tweeted, 

“RELEASE THE REST OF THE 
VIDEO OR LAWYER UP. This is 
part of a 2 minute monologue that 
I KNEW YOU WERE FILMING. I 
remember you guys.”

Held 
said 
the 
situation 

reminded her of another in which 
dozens of people accused Detroit-
area tattoo artist Alex Boyko of 
sexual assault and harassment. 
Boyko then filed a defamation suit 
against another tattoo artist who 
he said was responsible for the 
flood of accusations.

Last month was not the first 

time Potts’s behavior has been 
called into question, however. 
Yelp reviews dating back as 
far as 2010 describe Potts as 
“bizarrely rude,” “shady,” and 
“intimidating,” 
recommending 

future customers avoid him. 
Several reviews also indicate 
customers experienced Potts as 
being racist. In a review from 
April 13, 2010, a customer wrote, 
“... my best friend told me that 
while she was there she heard 
the owner and one of the piercers 
guffawing over the fact that the 
piercer had messed with a couple 
of Indian women who had come 
in recently.”

expressed her optimism for the 
conversations with MESA and 
the University moving forward.

“We are moving in a positive 

direction,” Rivas said. “We 
understand that there’s a lot of 
demands that can’t be solved 
in a certain timeframe. They 
require time, so I think we’ve 
been understanding on that end 
because (the administration) 
have been addressing the ones 
that are more immediate or 
easier to tackle.”

MESA director Nadia Bazzy 

confirmed in an email the 
organization has met with La 
Casa and wrote the University 
is focused on concrete solutions 
to the demands proposed by La 
Casa.

“Student Life leadership has 

met with La Casa on an ongoing 
basis 
since 
the 
demands,” 

Bazzy wrote. “The goal has 
been to listen, dialogue and 
deliver actionable items to 
strengthen partnerships and 
community.”

One of the initial demands 

called 
for 
full 
financial 

support for Assisting Latin@s 
to Maximize Achievement, a 
program designed to provide 
incoming 
Latinx 
students 

with necessary resources and 
support once they arrive at the 
University. La Casa specified it 
wanted ALMA to start prior to 
the official University move-
in date to avoid conflicts with 
other orientation programs.

According to LSA senior 

Yezeñia 
Sandoval, 
external 

director of La Casa, ALMA 
celebrated 18 years last week 
with additional support from 
MESA, 
which 
has 
led 
to 

increased support for incoming 
Latinx students. 

“(ALMA) 
really 

demonstrated the University’s 
commitment and leadership 
to helping La Casa grow and 
expand and helping recruit 
and retain Latinx incoming 
students, so I feel like they’ve 

really been pivotal in helping 
create action plans so that 
across campus, different offices 
can really cater their services 
to the diverse community that 
they serve,” Sandoval said.

With regard to the action 

plans, 
Sandoval 
and 
Rivas 

mentioned a pending joint press 
release from La Casa and the 
University about the status of 
the demands. Rivas said a few 
of the initiatives the University 
has been currently working on 
include the reinstallation of the 
previously removed art from 
the César Chávez Lounge in 
the Mosher-Jordan Residence 
Hall and an increased effort in 
diversified job applicant pools.

According 
to 
Sandoval 

and Rivas, the lack of Latinx 
representation in faculty and 
staff positions is still one of 
La Casa’s central demands. 
While 2017’s Hispanic/Latino 
student population sat near 6 
percent, data from the Office 
of Budget and Planning for 
2017 shows the percentage 
of 
Hispanic/Latino 
regular 

instructional faculty — which 
includes tenure-track faculty, 
non-tenure-track faculty and 
lecturers — was 3.97 percent. 

Sandoval 
said 
the 
low 

number 
of 
Latinx 
faculty 

members is a result of the 
applicant pools. While La Casa 
claimed the pools have seen an 
increase in diversity, Sandoval 
argues it isn’t enough.

“Outreach is a big (focus 

area) too because it’s not 
enough to just make sure 
applicant pools are diverse 
enough but it’s also important 
to make sure what outlets are 
we reaching out to (and) how 
else are we expanding and 
including 
the 
community?” 

Sandoval said.

Sandoval 
suggested 

the Professional Latino/as at 
UM Alliance , a network of staff 
and faculty at the University 
whose 
missions 
include 

furthering Latinx culture and 
increasing 
Latinx 
presence 

on campus, should receive 
further utilization. Sandoval 
said PLUMA should be notified 

of job openings so additional 
qualified Latinx candidates can 
apply.

“There’s a lot of potential, 

there’s 
a 
lot 
of 
Latinx 

individuals 
out 
there 
that 

have these qualifications but 
are you seeking them out?” 
Sandoval said. “Holding others 
accountable and seeing where 
you’re posting these jobs (and) 
how are you reaching out to 
Latinx faculty and staff … is a 
big part of (the conversation).”

Moving 
into 
September, 

which is also Latinx Heritage 
Month, 
Bazzy 
said 
the 

University is allocating more 
financial support for La Casa’s 
Heritage Month activities, as 
well as funding for programs 
and 
better 
employment 

opportunities 
to 
ease 
the 

burden of tuition.

“MESA, 
La 
Casa, 
and 

other campus partners have 
been 
working 
throughout 

the 
summer 
to 
provide 

programming 
for 
the 

campus 
community,” 
Bazzy 

wrote. “MESA has secured 
increased 
funding 
for 
all 

heritage 
month 
programs, 

mentorship 
programs, 
and 

grants for students and student 
organizations 
for 
ongoing 

work on campus, as well as, 
increased 
the 
number 
of 

student jobs in MESA and the 
rate of pay to better support the 
campus community.”

As conversations on the 

demands continue, Rivas said 
the main goal will continue 
to help Latinx students at the 
University feel as though they 
are supported and accepted 
by their peers and academic 
institution.

“I am very optimistic about 

this coming year and all the 
progress that will be made, 
and I am always excited to see 
La Casa grow into the largest 
Latinx 
organization 
that 

supports all of our community 
members and makes them 
feel like they have a home at 
Michigan,” Rivas said.

Examining “Crazy Rich Asians”
“C

razy Rich Asians” has 
been a smash hit this 
summer. Not only 
are many of my Asian American 
peers hailing it as a fantastic movie 
that gives Asian Americans the 
representation they need, but it’s the 
first Hollywood film featuring an 
all Asian-American cast since “The 
Joy Luck Club,” which was released 
25 years ago. It’s not hard to see why 
so many people are excited about it.
The stars of the film are 
also aware of its impact. In an 
interview on “Jimmy Kimmel 
Live,” Awkwafina, who plays Peik 
Lin Goh in the movie, said about the 
lack of Asian Americans in films: 
“If you think about it ... a 25-year-
old adult is just walking around 
without representation.” She then 
went on to speak more about “Crazy 
Rich Asians,” saying that “it’s so 
impactful for Asian Americans. 
Asian Americans come out of the 
screenings, and they’re, you know, 
crying, and they don’t know exactly 
why. And I think it’s the power of 
representation.”
However, despite how easy it is 
to just praise “Crazy Rich Asians” 
as a film with representation, it’s 
important to examine the film 
not only from an Asian-American 
perspective, but also from the 
perspective of people who are of 
Asian descent, but not American.
I stumbled across a Facebook 
post 
by 
activist 
Sangeetha 
Thanapal, 
who 
criticized 
the 
movie. She wrote: “Singapore is a 
terribly racist country. The state 
embarked on a form of eugenics 
in the 1980s meant to displace its 
indigenous population and replace 
it with settler colonial Chinese 
people ... So when you celebrate 
this movie, ask yourself who 
you are complicit in erasing.” Her 
boldest statement, however, comes 
when 
she 
explicitly 
criticizes 
Asian Americans’ willingness to 
celebrate the movie’s cast: “CRA 
is set in Singapore and only has 
Chinese people in it. This isn’t 
new or refreshing, this is the 
EVERYDAY FUCKIN LIVES OF 
MINORITIES. It is only diversity 

FOR YOU.”
In an article he wrote in The 
Atlantic, Mark Tseng-Putterman 
explores 
the 
same 
kinds 
of 
problems with “Crazy Rich Asians” 
as Thanapal, stating that “while 
the cast includes a mix of Chinese, 
Japanese and Korean diaspora 
actors of various nationalities, 
besides Henry Golding (who is of 
Iban descent) it effectively excludes 
South and Southeast Asians despite 
their deep presence in Singaporean 
society.” He also points out that “the 
only South Asians that viewers can 
glimpse are in the roles of servants 
and guards.”

I 
admittedly 
don’t 
know 
anything about racial and cultural 
tensions in Singapore, and I haven’t 
even watched the movie yet. While 
some may argue that it’s simply a 
romantic comedy and such movies 
need not be taken seriously, it’s 
impossible 
to 
simultaneously 
praise a movie for its representation 
while blatantly ignoring its lack of 
representation in a non-American 
context. We can’t ignore that this 
film celebrates Chinese privilege 
and the oppression of Singaporeans 
in the same way that so many 
Hollywood films emphasize white 
privilege and completely disregard 
people of color.
It’s also incredibly problematic 
to praise a film’s representation 
by simply looking at the actors’ 
ethnicities: Casting a person of 
color means nothing if the depiction 
of their character serves the same 
purpose that excluding minorities 
does. People of color should not 
settle for simply having non-

white representation. We need to 
look beyond an actor’s race and 
examine the character: Do they 
embody harmful stereotypes, such 
as the “socially incompetent Asian 
American” or “angry Black woman” 
tropes? Does the character serve the 
role of being “one of the good ones” 
by catering to white expectations 
and distancing themselves from 
the “bad” people of color, as Tseng-
Putterman argues that “Crazy Rich 
Asians” is guilty of? Not asking 
ourselves these types of questions 
and instead mindlessly celebrating 
representation leaves us vulnerable 
to ignorance and complicity.
However, that is not to say 
that everyone who feels validated 
by “Crazy Rich Asians” should 
feel ashamed for liking it, and we 
certainly 
shouldn’t 
ignore 
the 
positive aspects of the movie. It 
makes sense that so many Asian 
Americans are so emotional about 
the film — we’re used to not seeing 
a single person of Asian descent in 
a leading role, much less an entire 
cast of them. We’re used to seeing 
Asian Americans being portrayed 
as unattractive characters who 
are 
almost 
always 
incredibly 
submissive and shy or nerdy and 
weird. “Crazy Rich Asians” defies 
these stereotypes with its cast of 
Asian American actors who all 
portray characters with actual 
personalities. It’s impossible to 
refer to any of them as “the Asian 
one” because they’re all Asian. 
This means that the audience has 
to actually see past the characters’ 
race and remember them for their 
other qualities.
Despite all of its great qualities, 
however, I’m wary of supporting 
a 
film 
that 
celebrates 
Asian 
Americans at the expense of other 
Asians. I probably will end up 
watching it illegally online or on 
Netflix, depending on where it 
becomes available first. Still, I don’t 
think I’ll end up idolizing the movie 
like so many of my peers have done. 
That’s a good thing.

The virtues of McCain

NOAH HARRISON | COLUMN

S

en. John McCain, R-Ariz., 
sadly passed away last 
week 
after 
a 
yearlong 
battle with brain cancer, marking 
the end of the illustrious life 
of one of the country’s most 
respected legislators. McCain’s 
death evoked widespread tribute 
that transcended partisan and 
ideological lines. Among the 
many who mourned McCain’s 
passing were several of his 
former rivals and opponents, 
including Joe Biden, George Bush 
and Barack Obama, the latter two 
of which delivered eulogies at 
his funeral. Though my political 
views and McCain’s diverged 
frequently, I too admire him and 
will miss the dignity, civility and 
integrity which came to define 
his career.
McCain 
brought 
ambition 
and fire to Washington, D.C., but 
he also brought character. Some 
of McCain’s most extraordinary 
moments came in the many 
instances in which he bucked 
party or popular opinion in his 
pursuit of decency, no matter the 
political cost. At a campaign rally 
during the 2008 presidential race, 
he famously rebuffed a woman 
who called then-Senator Barack 
Obama an “Arab” and another 
supporter who said he was 
“scared” of Obama’s supposed 
ulterior motives. A decade later, 
we 
can 
appreciate 
McCain’s 
decision to quell these baseless 
sentiments rather than exploit 
them for political gain as several 
others have.
McCain’s 
commitment 
to 
character and civility was not 
limited to the campaign trail. 
On Capitol Hill, he led the 
condemnation 
of 
torture 
and 
enhanced interrogation techniques 
by the CIA, drawing on his past 
experiences as a prisoner of war 
in Vietnam to affirm that morality 
is not malleable. He provided 

leadership on many legislative 
issues, 
including 
defense 
and 
national 
security 
issues, 
but 
also in areas less popular with 
his Republican colleagues, like 
campaign finance reform. His 
prioritization of duty ahead of 
political expediency occasionally 
put him at odds with his own 
party, such as with his “no” vote 
on the “skinny repeal” health 
care bill in 2017, which killed 
GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare. 
Unlike several of his colleagues 
who also voiced severe concerns 
over that bill, McCain refused to 
bow to immense political pressure 
to support the bill, exemplifying 
his unyielding commitment to do 
what he thought was right and his 
refreshing disinterest in political 
ramifications. 
McCain 
was 
certainly an effective legislator, but 
he will be remembered not only 
for his accomplishments, but also 
for how he achieved them: with 
civility, candor and character.
Regrettably, these virtues are 
increasingly rare in our current 
political landscape. There seem 
to be few remaining members 
of Congress and public officials 
who command the bipartisan 
admiration and respect, much 
less to the extent that McCain 
did. In many ways, McCain’s 
death appears to mark the end of a 
broader era, as our nation’s politics 
continue a descent into bluster and 
rancor. The 2018 midterm elections 
serve as an exodus for many 
moderating, civil voices. Several 
Republicans with reputations for 
decorum, including Sen. Jeff Flake, 
R-Ariz., and Sen. Bob Corker, 
R-Tenn., are stepping down. On the 
Democratic side, few are retiring, 
but the party’s current civil war 
between the establishment and 
progressives has seen progressives 
supplant several more moderate 
Democrats, including incumbent 
Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., who was 

unseated by Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez. Ideological battles and 
heated campaigns are a staple of 
democracy and to be expected, 
but we must not let civility and 
character become relics of the past.
Regardless of how the midterms 
play out, Congress will have quite a 
few newcomers in 2019. Whether 
they embrace the sense of duty and 
honor embodied by John McCain 
or succumb to the incivility remains 
to be seen, but the early signs aren’t 
great. Kelli Ward, a former GOP 
primary candidate in Arizona’s 
Senate race, had the audacity to 
claim that McCain’s decision to end 
medical treatment was timed to 
hurt her campaign. At the state level, 
Kansas 
gubernatorial 
candidate 
Kris Kobach allegedly hired staffers 
associated with white supremacist 
groups. In this era of American 
politics, demagogues are far more 
common, and often more successful, 
than principled statesmen.
John 
McCain’s 
legacy 
of 
putting country first is one that 
we must strive to recreate. In 
a way, it is paradoxical that 
we widely recognize McCain’s 
virtues yet routinely support 
those who fail to emulate them. 
Politicians who fail to rise above 
the 
fray 
legitimize 
extreme 
sentiments and contribute little 
to the national discussion.
Those who are unwilling to 
move beyond rhetoric, partisan 
loyalty and ideological crusades 
once in office are not worthy of 
our votes. One does not need to 
be a moderate or even a maverick 
to emulate the virtues of McCain. 
McCain leaves behind a void 
of decency and respect in our 
politics, and ultimately it is our 
responsibility to fill it.

Data protection is a national priority

ALEXANDER SATOLA | COLUMN

T

he tide is finally turning 
for 
consumer 
data 
protection in the United 
States, and though internet users 
may have been aware that their 
activity was being tracked online, 
recent developments have shown 
just how much personal data the 
tech industry collects and shares 
about its users. As people growing 
up in the turbulent digital age, 
college students are at the forefront 
of a sea of change in the future of 
big data.
In 
June, 
the 
California 
Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 
passed through the California 
legislature. 
The 
law 
offers 
consumers 
more 
transparency 
over the use and transfer of their 
personal data, including the right 
to know what types of information 
companies collect about them, 
as well as the recipients of that 
information. A pivotal provision 
in the bill is the “private right of 
action,” which permits consumer 
lawsuits in the case of a traditional 
data breach, such as the T-Mobile 
data breach in August that exposed 
the personal information of 2 
million people. The law, subject to 
amendments, will enter into effect 
in January 2020.
The legislation, however, is 
weak compared to the behemoth 
European 
Union-sponsored 
General 
Data 
Protection 
Regulation that entered into effect 
this May. It gives consumers an 
unprecedented amount of control 
over their personal data, how it is 
used and who is allowed to use it. 
Crucially, it lets regulators levy 
massive fines up to 20 million euros 
or 4 percent of global turnover — 
whichever is higher — if companies 
break the rules. Under prior 
legislation, Facebook was fined 
£500,000 (about $700,000) for its 
role in improperly transferring the 
private information of 87 million 
users to Cambridge Analytica, a 
political consulting firm. Under 
the GDPR, the fine would have 
been equal to four percent of global 
turnover, or, put more simply, £1.4 
billion (about $1.96 billion).
Facing these new regulatory 
threats, 
tech 
companies 
are 
intensifying legal action within 
an already massive framework. 
Facebook, for example, spent more 
on lobbying in the first quarter of 

2018 than ever before, dangling 
$3.3 million in front of lawmakers 
to influence policy, according to a 
Senate filing. Facebook CEO Mark 
Zuckerberg and his colleagues are 
lobbying Congress to draft a new 
federal data privacy law, one that 
would hopefully kill two birds with 
one stone: erasing the California 
legislation and putting in place 
regulations that are friendlier to 
their data mining practices.
If we have learned anything 
from the revelations of Cambridge 
Analytica, the use of targeted 
advertising to unfairly influence 
the 
2016 
presidential 
election 
and the irresponsibility of tech 
companies that process our personal 
information, then it is time we call for 
federal data protection without the 
outsized influence of Silicon Valley 
firms. American lawmakers should 
adopt data protection as a bipartisan 
priority because the practices of data 
mining run amok infringe on the 
liberties of ordinary Americans.
With the midterm elections 
fast approaching, citizens would 
benefit from an overarching data 
protection law. The need for 
such a law is evident, especially 
after a CNN report revealed that 
Russian-linked 
Facebook 
ads 
targeted residents of Michigan 
and Wisconsin in key demographic 
areas during the 2016 election. 
The anonymous sources in the 
report indicated the ads filled 
people’s 
feeds 
with 
racially-
tinged and anti-Muslim rhetoric. 
While there is nothing illegal 
about targeted advertising, when 
a company like Facebook allows 
the weaponization of its platform 
by 
a 
foreign 
government 
to 
influence our elections, its apathy 
is an affront to democracy. In a 
country built upon the liberty of 
the individual, tech companies’ 
treatment of their customers as 
bottomless pits of data is nothing 
less than exploitation.
Lawmakers should thus be 
skeptical of any proposal floated 
to them by an industry lobbyist. 
Facebook lobbyist Joel Kaplan 
warned the California law could 
spread to other states and act 
as a threat to the industry and a 
regulatory nightmare. To be fair, 
state legislatures would needlessly 
torture companies if they each 
implemented 
similar-but-not-

identical privacy policies. Instead, 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
the 
Internet 
Association 
and 
the 
Information 
Technology 
Industry Council are all pushing 
for voluntary standards, where 
the companies would continue to 
create and enforce their own rules.
In order to ensure the privacy 
rights of all citizens, we should no 
longer accept this monopoly on 
the control of our data. The days 
of blind trust in a self-regulatory 
system for these companies are 
over, and Congress now has an 
opportunity 
to 
draft 
federal 
legislation with teeth to ensure 
the 
proper 
handling 
of 
our 
personal information. Such a law 
would reform the Federal Trade 
Commission, which is the current 
regulatory body tasked with data 
security. Born in an analog era, it 
should be reviewed for its efficacy 
in fighting data breaches in the 
digital age.
In addition, while the GDPR 
is not perfect, representatives 
in Congress should study its 
provisions for consumer-centric 
data policy with a keen eye. The 
GDPR requires organizations to 
demonstrate that they process 
data fairly, openly communicate 
with customers and employees, 
and not keep data for longer than 
required. These are common sense 
regulations that are missing in the 
U.S. on a federal level.
Congress must use the coming 
months to reflect on our national 
data 
security 
policy. 
Privacy 
rights groups in California and 
lawmakers in Brussels have made 
great progress toward a fairer 
alternative to the current situation, 
where the interests of large 
corporations prevail. However, 
there is still a lot of work to be 
done and firms such as Google 
and Facebook will fight for every 
byte of data. I do not attempt to 
demonize these companies for 
doing business. In many ways, 
big tech has improved our lives 
by connecting people around the 
world and serving as humanity’s 
largest 
pool 
of 
knowledge. 
However, their harm to society 
should not go unnoticed.

JOIN OUR EDITORIAL BOARD

Our Editorial Board meets Mondays and Wednesdays 7:15-8:45 PM at 
our newsroom at 420 Maynard Street. All are welcome to come discuss 
national, state and campus affairs.

People of color 
should not 
settle for simply 
having non-white 
representation.


Welcome “bAAck,” welcome 
home, 
welcome 
freshmen, 
welcome all … Welcome Week. 
Nothing screams the start of 
the school year quite like kiddie 
pools filled with sweat and 
beer, freshmen running around 
campus without chaperones for 
the first time in their lives and 
eating and drinking as though 
your body is a garbage disposal. 
Oftentimes I commit myself to 
portraying the world of food 
and wine on this campus as 
sophisticated, graceful and classy. 
And while I will attest to the fact 
that the students on this campus 
effuse elegance in their palettes 
when it comes to good food, that 
the Ann Arbor restaurants are top 
notch and unique and that a vast 
majority of Michigan students 
would 
consider 
themselves 
“foodies,” I cannot sugarcoat the 
one time of year that all of that 
foodie knowledge goes flying 
out the door. That special time 
of the year is Welcome Week. In 
honor of the end of such a sacred, 
foul 
and 
so-forgettable-that-
it’s-memorable week and the 
beginning of Syllabus Week, I have 
compiled the official Welcome 
Week Food and Beverage Pairing 
Recommendations to ensure that 
you celebrated the start of the 
2018–2019 school year with the 
perfect mix of class and utter 
disgrace.
No Thai and Yellow Tail 
Pinot Grigio: It wouldn’t be 
Welcome Week without No Thai, 
which means at least two days 
worth of leftover fried rice for just 
under $10. When splurging on 
your Thai food feast — in between 
forkfuls of oily, glistening pad 
thai noodles spattered with fried 
egg and onion — I recommend a 
nice, chilled glass of Yellow Tail 
Pinot Grigio. The perfect mix 
of elegance and efficiency when 

curing a hangover. Yellow Tail 
also balances and counters the 
potential spice involved in various 
No Thai dishes, making it all the 
more mild and enjoyable.
Pancheros and Mango Four 
Loko: If you’re desperate enough 
to opt for Pancheros vs Chipotle 
or BTB, you’re desperate enough 
to have a casual dinner time 
Floko. The casual Four Loko has 
been opposed and look down 
upon, but truly, if you are on the 
road to sprinting the marathon 
that is Welcome Week, there’s no 
better way to do it then a Floko 
+ Pancheros pairing. I’d opt for 
a chicken quesadilla with a side 
of chips and guac, keep things 
simple and traditional on the food 
end to make way for the real star 
of the show: the beverage. Wait 
until you are truly desperate and 
at your wits end before trying this 
dangerous duo, you may not make 
it to the next darty.
Leftover 
Domino’s 
and 
lukewarm Natty Lite: This 
pairing may sound like your 
worst nightmare. But imagine 
it like this: You stumble out of 
bed at 7:00 a.m. with a blaring 
headache, an unwelcome Svedka 
taste in the back of your mouth 
and the sudden urge to yak. You 
walk into your kitchen for a cup 
of water, but what’s there? Your 
roommate’s half eaten Domino’s 
pizza and a can of not-cold-but-
not-warm Natural Lite beer. You 
reach for the pizza and crack 
open a lukewarm one, not with 
the boys, but simply yourself 
and realize that you were always 
destined to hit this rare form of 
rock bottom. 
Rod’s Diner and Barefoot 
Moscato: How much sugar is 
too much sugar? In the event of 
Welcome Week, there is never 
enough sugar. Dessert wine is 
meant to pair with dessert — and 
that’s why Rod’s thick, creamy, 
blissful colliders pair perfectly 
with the goddess of all sweet 
wine: Barefoot Moscato. You may 

need some water and perhaps a 
pre-pregame nap after this duo 
knocks you out.
Amer’s 
Açaí 
Bowls 
and 
White Claw: The OFFICIAL 
basic Michigan girl Welcome 
Week food and drink pairing is 
an Amer’s açaí bowl topped with 
granola and peanut butter in one 
hand and a can of 100 calorie 
White Claw hard seltzer in the 
other. Due to prime location and 
the menu’s opportune breakfast 
options, this pairing is also a 
definite game day duo, ingested 
by all the girls who occupy the 
hallowed halls of Arbor Blu, 
Landmark and Zaragon. 
Fleetwood 
Diner 
Hippie 
Hash and Smirnoff Ice: When 
going for the quirkiness that is 
Fleetwood Diner, one must always 
expect the element of surprise. 
And what’s more surprising than 
finding a planted Smirnoff Ice 
in your Fleetwood booth upon 
arrival, planted there by only your 
sneakiest friends? After getting 
on one knee and making it onto all 
of your friends’ snapchat stories 
in all your shame and pajamas, 
hippie hash will never feel so 
right, so fulfilling, so greasy and 
so good.
Smoke’s 
Poutinerie 
and 
Kamchatka: Both of these have 
something in common: You don’t 
know how you got there, you 
never intended to get there, you 
promised yourself you wouldn’t 
get there, but alas, there you 
are. Nobody goes out with the 
intention to end up at Beaver 
Trap eating poutine or taking 
pulls of Kamchatka in a sweaty 
basement, but nobody goes into 
this week with the intention of 
meeting many goals either. That’s 
why each bite of cheesy, gravy-
drenched 
poutine 
should 
be 
washed down with a nice big gulp 
of Kamchatka vodka.
Pizza 
House 
Feta 
Bread 
and Franzia: Perhaps the most 
coveted, most important, most 
popular of all food and beverage 

pairings during welcome week, 
the pair who always knows 
five brothers and runs into 24 
people they know in the Diag 
at any moment of the day, is feta 
bread and Franzia. Perhaps it’s 
the alliteration, perhaps it’s the 
tradition, perhaps it’s the so-bad-
it’s-good sentiment running deep 
through both choices — whatever 
it is, these two wrongs certainly 
make a right. Whether you’re 
ordering a late night feta bread 
after going out, cozying up in a 
midday Pizza House booth or 
having a quick pre-nap-and-rally 
snack, nothing pairs better with 
gooey, cheesy feta bread than a 
nice drag of Franzia wine straight 
out of the bag.
Rick’s Mind Probe and 7/11 
taquitos: What’s in a Mind Probe 
and what’s in a taquito from 7/11? 
Many of us don’t know the answer 
to either. On a normal week I’d 
offer the opinion that both are 
horrible choices. But something 
about the dark, dimly lit staircase 
descending into Rick’s juxtaposed 
by the blinding, fluorescent 7/11 
sign 
swinging 
ominously 
on 
South Forest makes me want 
to venture a guess that a Rick’s 
Mind Probe would be missing 
something without the crunch of 
a 7/11 taquito between each sip.
I cannot be disappointed by 
this campus, though it loses its 
foodie attitude for the week 
before school begins. Ann Arbor 
celebrates so many highs in 
the gastronomic field — trendy 
restaurants, tasty new dishes 
and daring chefs — but we must 
remember our late Aug. roots. 
Once classes begin and school 
is in full swing, the Kombucha 
bottles, trendy lattes and ramen 
noodle bowls will be all the 
rage once more. Until next year, 
that is, when we can consult 
this trusty guide for the best 
recommendations of just what 
to pair with that leftover, early 
morning feta bread in order to 
have the best Welcome Week yet.

Eating through Welcome Week

DAILY FOOD COLUMN

It was a Tuesday night, and 
frankly, I wasn’t expecting a 
huge turnout — Grand Rapids 
isn’t the most accessible city 
in Mich., and Tuesdays aren’t 
typically ideal for club shows. 
I showed up early to check out 
the wildly impressive Thin Lips, 
whose new record Chosen Family 
is a testament to the raw talent 
that seems to flow endlessly 
from Philadelphia, which is 
also home to their tourmates 
in Hop Along. After their set, 
which included some back-up 
vocals from Hop Along’s Frances 
Quinlan, I looked around to 
notice the crowd had filled out 
significantly during the opening 
performance, which must have 
been near capacity by that point.
Hop Along is clearly turning 
heads, especially with their 
newest effort Bark Your Head 
Off, Dog, which landed them 
a feature in Rolling Stone 
published the day of the show. 
The album is tight, unpredictable 
and 
thoroughly 
impressive 
from front to back, featuring 
unmatched 
composition 
and 
hairpin changes in tempo and 
atmosphere. 
In 
all 
honesty, 
the album is so ambitious 
and complex I was worried it 
wouldn’t fare nearly as well live. 
My worries were entirely quelled 
by the end of their opening track 
(and new album opener), “How 
Simple.”
Hop Along’s related artists on 
Spotify include Jeff Rosenstock, 
Lemuria and Glocca Morra, who 
all are barely tangential to Hop 
Along in terms of similarity. 
Much like Spotify’s difficulty 
in finding similar artists (likely 
because there aren’t any), I won’t 

pretend to have the vocabulary 
to 
accurately 
describe 
Hop 
Along’s 
musicianship. 
Even 
within the confines of a live 
setting, their art is absolutely 
stunning; 
Quinlan’s 
vocals 
range from desperate yells to 
soft musings, best exemplified 
during “Not Abel,” a sprawling, 
biblically-charged 
track 
split 
into two distinct sections that 
the band navigated gracefully 
through its entire duration. 
The band’s greatest strength is 
inarguably the quality of each 
individual who brings these 
songs to life. Every instrument 
holds a significant weight in 
every song — not a single note 
goes to waste.
And to add to their impressive 
skill, the band was more than 
happy to banter with the crowd, 
lightening 
the 
mood 
while 
showing their own comfort 
and 
ease 
on 
stage. 
Quips 
from Quinlan included “You 
already paid your money, I hate 
Metallica!” and “Keep your shirt 
on, Jim!” referencing the boho 
aesthetic of Jim Morrison.
While touring in support of 
their newest album, Hop Along 
still included tracks from their 
previous 
records, 
rounding 
out a 14-track setlist that truly 
reflected 
the 
diversity 
and 
growth in their songwriting. Fan 
favorites included wonderful 
and poppy songs like “Tibetan 
Pop Stars” and “The Knock,” 
while deep cuts “Kids on the 
Boardwalk” and “Texas Funeral” 
were resounded back by the 
long time fans in the audience. 
When words seem to fail, Hop 
Along does the heavylifting with 
their songwriting, finding ways 
to convey feeling in their little 
narratives carried over fusions 
of pop, rock, indie and the 
occasional dash of folk.

Hop Along is 
turning heads

“Slender Man” is a horror 
movie released in 2018 based 
on the popular “creepypasta” 
that debuted in 2009. It is 
approximately 93 minutes long. 
It 
costars 
Joey 
King 
(“The 
Kissing Booth”). I can tell you all 
of this because the information 
is available on the Internet, yet 
despite having just seen the movie 
earlier today, I’m having trouble 
remembering a single thing that 
actually happens over its runtime. 
I’ve gone into a dissociative state 
once in my life, and honestly, this 
doesn’t feel dissimilar to that.
It’s not just that “Slender Man” 
fails at the things we expect from 
a horror movie or a movie in 
general, it’s that those things are 
completely absent. There’s no plot 
or story, there’s just one sequence 
of scares stuck to another with 
duct tape and spit. Four girls 
decide to summon “Slender Man,” 
as young girls in 2018 are wont 
to do. Uh oh, Slender Man shows 
up and does some ill-defined evil 
mumbo-jumbo with no apparent 
end goal. Then the movie ends. 

Over the 93 minutes, nothing 
anybody does makes any sense. 
The girls all just sort of accept at a 
certain point that Slender Man is 
haunting them and wait to die, and 
that’s the movie. They don’t fight 
back, because that would mean the 
writers would have to make them 

active, interesting characters, and 
who wants that?
For all the sins of the “story,” the 
characters fare somehow worse. 
None of the girls go through a 
change beyond moving from 
“not haunted” to “haunted,” but 
more than that, nobody is given 
a character to begin with. From 
beginning to end, they’re just 
featureless mannequins meant 
to carry us to the next hackneyed 
scare. Of the four girls that we 
begin the movie with, one of them 
disappears almost immediately, 
and 
another 
is 
seemingly 

forgotten by the script. The last 
two are saddled with two of the 
most laughable fates in recent 
horror history in a sequence that 
prompted one of the high-school 
aged “Slender” fans in front of 
me to stand up and declare to the 
theater and his friends, “Fuck it. 
I’m out.”
What horror there is can easily 
be divided into three camps: the 
classic jump scare, the creepy 
imagery without rhyme or reason 
and the stupid. If you’re not a fan 
of loud noises trying to tell you 
when to be scared, just wait and 
there will be a scene where a girl 
dreams she gives birth to Slender 
Man or where Slender Man uses 
FaceTime, both of which are things 
that actually happen. Perhaps the 
best thing that can be said about 
“Slender Man” is that there’s a 
variety of bad horror instead of 
just one kind. Cinematographer 
Luca del Puppo (“Mercy”) shoots 
it all in the most monotonous, 
ugly low light possible — the kind 
of darkness that will have you 
pleading for someone, anyone 
to turn on a damn light — but 
the movie is unpredictable in its 
awfulness nonetheless.
Perhaps most disappointingly, 

‘Slender Man’ falls short

FILM REVIEW

Mac 
Miller 
returned 
on 
Aug. 3rd with his fifth studio 
album, Swimming, in the wake 
of his heavily media-scrutinized 
breakup with Ariana Grande. 
Given that breakup and his recent 
DUI, expectations were that this 
album would be a depressed and 
chaotic work in the vein of his 
2014 mixtape Faces — however, 
what we’ve received instead is a 
phlegmatic piece of protracted 
contemplation, more thoughtful 
than despondent.
Swimming 
feels 
like 
the 
companion piece to his most recent 
album The Divine Feminine, a 
continuation of the jazz-influenced 
sound but with a polar opposite 
thematic message. The Divine 
Feminine was a record of love and 
optimism; Swimming is lonesome 
(but not lonely) and reflective — a 
world-weary expression of self-
acceptance. For better or for worse, 
the album tends to blur together 
due to instrumental sameness. 
Some would call this cohesiveness, 
some would call it a lack of variety; 
lean toward the latter. The addition 
of “Programs” could have lessened 
this sense of repetition, different 
enough to provide a change of 
pace but similar enough to not be a 
jarring inclusion. 
It wasn’t much of a challenge 

to improve upon the lyricism 
of The Divine Feminine, which 
was a concept album about Mac 
eating out his girlfriend. To be 
fair, if I were having sex with 
Ariana Grande, I’d probably never 
stop bragging about it either. He 

managed to step it up on Swimming, 
and now that the two are no longer 
together, Mac is forced to explore 
themes more varied than Ariana 
Grande’s vagina, including issues 
such as isolation, helplessness 
and the long-term impact of fame. 
However, despite discussing more 
serious topics, the album never 
sinks into darkness or pessimism. 
“It ain’t perfect but I don’t mind” 
Mac 
sighs/moans/sings 
on 
“Perfecto,” a line which sums up 
his overarching philosophy on 
Swimming pretty well: The way 
to deal with life’s problems is to go 
with the flow, the lyrical equivalent 
of shrugging one’s shoulders.
The standouts on the album are 
“Self-Care,” “Ladders,” “What’s 
the Use?” and “2009.” “Self-Care” 
is full of airy ambience and a well-
executed beat switch. “Ladders” 
and “What’s the Use?” are bouncy 
funk jams that are solidly in the 
pocket, 
and 
“2009” 
contains 
beautiful orchestration (courtesy 

of Jon Brion) as well as some of 
Mac’s more thoughtful lyrics as he 
reflects on his past. 
One of the weaker cuts is 
“Conversation Pt. 1,” a worse 
version of “I Am Who I Am (Killing 
Time),” the vocals and instrumental 
both dreadfully boring (surprising, 
given that Flying Lotus is credited 
with production on the track). The 
only moment of dynamism on the 
track is a lame trumpet part tacked 
on the end that sounds like a Miles 
Davis impersonator on a high dose 
of lithium. 
Given both how long Mac 
has been around and how many 
projects he has released, it’s hard 
to believe that he’s only 26 years 
old (younger than Kanye West 
was when he released The College 
Dropout!). In spite of his young age, 
Swimming feels like the reflective 
conclusion to a lengthy career. 
Because Mac started so young, 
his late-game coincides with an 
age at which he begins to ripen on 
the vine (in direct contrast with 
Kanye, whose denouncement thus 
far has consisted of becoming 
a sundowning Boomer whose 
Twitter is one step removed from 
shit like “live, laugh, love” and 
Minion memes). While Swimming 
isn’t a perfect record, and will likely 
be considered inconsequential in 
relation to Mac’s other post-Blue 
Slide Park discography, it’s a good, 
if not incredible, album with some 
standout cuts.

MUSIC REVIEW

there was a scenario where 
“Slender 
Man” 
actually 
had 
a purpose. Since its creation, 
Slender 
Man 
has 
become 
something of a dark mascot for 
lonely young people, climaxing 
in 2014 when two young girls 
stabbed their friend 19 times in 
order to become servants of the 
creature, as chronicled in HBO’s 
2017 
documentary 
“Beware 
the Slenderman.” There was an 
opportunity for this interpretation 

of the “Slender Man” mythos to 
engage with the same topics that 
doc covered — loneliness and how 
the internet can be used to spread 
a story — but from a different 
perspective. While there are brief, 
brief moments where these things 
are touched upon, they play almost 
no part in the story at large and no 
statement is made; it’s as pointless 
as anything else.
With a movie lacking completely 
in story, character development, 

horror and purpose, what is there 
to bring audiences to the theater? 
There’s 
some 
unintentional 
comedy to be sure — there’s a 
supposedly “scary” moment so 
soul-crushingly stupid that it sent 
the entire theater into hysterics — 
but more than anything, “Slender 
Man” is just dull. It’s an absolute 
chore to sit through in a way few 
movies are, and each successive 
scene of nothing happening just 
makes it worse.

8A — Tuesday, September 4, 2018
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The most impressive music 
careers are those that convey an 
evolution in a creative sense: The 
Beatles and their growth from 
Please, Please Me to Sergeant 

Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, 
Kanye West and his growth from 
The College Dropout to Yeezus. 
Ideally, a musician’s respective 
genre should follow their creative 
advances, making for a fascinating 
display of an artist’s capability to 
mold peers and followers and to 
guide an entire genre toward a 
more creatively inspired realm. 
Similar to The Beatles’ impact on 
rock and Kanye’s impact on hip 
hop, Young Thug has been on his 
way to trap immortality as his 
artistry has evolved and the genre 
has responded with appeal. 
From his debut on Rich Gang’s 
2014 single, “Lifestyle,” that had 
listeners marveling at the warbling 
vocal style that would become 
Thug’s most iconic trait, to the 
lavender dress worn on the cover 
of 2016’s JEFFERY, Thug has 
planted himself at the vanguard 
of trap music, constantly breaking 
conventions to advance the genre 
from generally nonmusical and 
hypermasculine 
to 
beautifully 
melodic 
and 
accepting 
of 
femininity. His discography is 
covered in hard trap, groovy 
funk and homey country, and has 
become increasingly complex with 
each release (he has even received 
nods from Kanye and Elton John 
for his originality and capacity to 
push hip hop’s envelope.)
That these trendsetting and 
creative characteristics are so 
ingrained in Thug’s artistry makes 

his most recent release, Slime 
Language, a bit of a head-scratcher. 
The mixtape is bogged down by 
unoriginal 
features, 
outdated 
beats and a lack of thematic focus. 
Even its cover, with green and red 
slime oozing over hands miming 
the words “Young Stoner Life” in 
sign language, is confusing and 
uninspiring. 
Slime Language’s first knock is 
its features. In such a collaborative 
era in hip hop, it’s never a surprise 
to find a few featured artists on 
an album. In fact, it’s actually 
quite rare to come across a 
featureless project (see: J. Cole’s 
“platinum 
with 
no 
features” 
trend). Oftentimes, collaborating 
with other artists on a track 
allows a rapper to pool various 
fan bases and create a super-team 
effect. Because hip hop is such a 
personality-driven 
genre, 
each 
star has a unique voice and style, 
so listeners find a little extra 
excitement in hearing how their 
favorite personalities tackle a track 
together. The formula is typically 
fun and successful, but only when 
the personalities merged on a track 
each provide something different 
and impressive; on Slime, this 
almost never happens. Thirteen 
of the tape’s 15 tracks feature an 
artist other than Young Thug. 
What’s more, nearly every featured 
artist seems to be doing their 
best Thug impression, sounding 
indistinguishable from him and 
the other featured artists and 
accordingly eliminating the multi-
personality benefit of features. 
Additionally, for an artist who 
is perhaps most known for his 
catchy hooks, Thug outsources 
the choruses of his Slime tracks 
to other artists too often, leaving 
listeners craving more of his 
anthemic vocal acrobatics. 
Slime also falls short in the 
music department. Nearly every 
track has a beat loop with loud 
808 bass tied to each kick drum, a 
template popularized by producer 
Metro Boomin in trap’s early days, 

but one that more complex and 
musical methods of production 
have left in the dust. Ironically, 
Thug was one of the artists to 
transcend this simple template, 
incorporating elements of funk 
into JEFFERY and elements of 
country into Beautiful Thugger 
Girls. With Slime, though, the 
beats seem to have slipped back 
into 2015, a concern especially 
noticeable in the wake of Travis 
Scott’s ASTROWORLD, a project 
that raised the bar for trap’s 
musical standard just a few weeks 
prior. (Perhaps Thug could benefit 
from Scott’s eclectic production 
process.)
While the actual content of the 
project is nothing special, Thug did 
manage to bring progress in one 
regard: women. Trap has always 
been and still is a genre dominated 
by men, often braggadociously 
rapping about how they mistreat 
women. Thus, female features 
are almost unheard of. On Slime, 
however, three tracks feature 
female artists, and not in the 
conventional way with sung hooks 
in a pretty voice to counterbalance 
the masculinity of the verses; these 
female rappers have full verses 
and rap about fucking shit up 
and making money behind heavy 
autotune. So, even with a sonically 
lackluster project, Thug continues 
to make some waves. 
Realistically, 
the 
mixtape 
does have a handful of bangers. 
Just because it sounds outdated 
and simple doesn’t mean it won’t 
augment your party playlists; 
“Audemar,” “Chanel (Go Get It)” 
and “Scoliosis” are highlights 
that provide the raw vocals and 
hype-inducing flow that Thug fans 
crave. Still, in the broader lens of 
music as something that breathes 
and grows with time, it seems 
like the rest of the trap world has 
finally caught up with Young Thug, 
leaving Slime Language stale and 
unoriginal. We’ll just have to wait 
for the next slimey project to see if 
Thugger can still turn heads.

MUSIC REVIEW

What 
happens 
when 
you 
combine all the underutilized token 
Asians from sitcom television into 
one movie? Pure comedy gold. 
From established actors like 

Ken 
Jeong 
(“Community”) 
and Michelle Yeoh (“Star Trek: 
Discovery”) to the up-and-coming 
Awkwafina 
(“Ocean’s 
8”) 
to 
misused supporting characters like 
Ronny Chieng (“The Daily Show”) 
and Jimmy O. Yang (“Silicon 
Valley”) to the face of a new era of 
Asian-American representation on 
television, Constance Wu (“Fresh 
Off the Boat”) — “Crazy Rich 
Asians” has them all.
The movie, based on the 2013 
book trilogy by Kevin Kwan, 
follows Rachel Chu (Wu) as she 
accompanies her boyfriend Nick 
Young (Henry Golding, “A Simple 
Favor”) to his home country of 
Singapore. She soon realizes Nick 
is not your average New Yorker, 
but the heir-apparent to one of the 

richest real estate families in Asia. 
Traditional and modern values 
clash as Rachel, an ABC (American-
born-Chinese), tries to fit in with 
Nick’s family — particularly his 
intimidating 
mother, 
Eleanor 
(Yeoh).
At this point in Hollywood 
representation, the main focus still 
lies on undermining stereotypes, 
rather than making race secondary 
to the characters themselves. In 
an ideal world, an Asian character 
would just be a character, free of 
the burden to hold up a positive, 
progressive image of their race.
Promoting 
diversity 
as 
the 
selling point of a movie returns the 
target audience to white people or, 
in the case of “Crazy Rich Asians,” 
all non-Asian demographics. 
While non-Asians or non-Asian-
Americans might view some of 
the caricatured supporting cast 
in the Kevin Kwan adaptation as 
defying stereotypes, this is not 
quite the case. Instead, the film 
mines deeper caves for stereotypes, 
some recognizable only to those 
who have been immersed in Asian 
culture and heritage. 
Of course, stereotypes are a 
trademark necessity of filling out 
the cast of a romantic comedy, 
where screentime for sidekicks 
are minimal and, as a result, 
characterization 
as 
well. 
The 

flaws of “Crazy Rich Asians” has 
everything to do with the rom-com 
format itself and not the fact that 
Asians helm every aspect of the 
film. 
There’s the predictable plot, 
outlandish 
romantic 
gestures, 
refusal to engage in serious politics, 
but also the impressive aspects of 
rom-coms: Gatsby-esque set design, 
believable chemistry between the 
leads and zingy one-liners.
“Crazy Rich Asians” feels at 
times like an opportunity for non-
Asians to venture into an “exotic” 
world Hollywood has ignored 
since its beginnings. However, the 
all-Asian cast in a blockbuster film 
made buying a ticket to this film 
still incredibly emotional. 
Reviewers 
(percentage-wise 
mostly 
non-Asian) 
walked 
on 
eggshells around this film, refusing 
to strike down the issues with 
rom-coms in fear of undermining 
the importance of this turn in 
representation. 
For people looking for a solid 
rom-com, “Crazy Rich Asians” 
delivers, 
not 
buckling 
under 
the pressure of a history of 
underrepresentation. 
However, 
in terms of the quality of the film 
itself, “Crazy Rich Asians” is just 
another rom-com, though that may 
be its greatest accomplishment to 
on the road to equality.

Michigan in Color

The existence of a woman of 
color is in and of itself an act of 
resistance.
These are my words. Sound nice 
don’t they? Sound... empowering?
Or maybe it sounds like the 
faux deep mantra of a girl who’s 
trying to convince herself that 
she’s a good social justice activist.
It may sound like beautiful 
words that give an accurate 
reflection of what it means to be 
a woman of color, but to me...it 
sounds like an excuse.
It was my excuse when my 
parents commented on how I 
was leaving a STEM field when 
I switched majors, a field that 
is historically unkind to people 
who aren’t male or white. In 
retaliation, 
I 
showed 
them 
statistics about the number of 
non-white 
female 
producers 
in television and film. Shonda 
Rhimes and Mindy Kaling are 
big names, but they are still only 
two names I said. I’d be helping to 
pioneer a path for other girls if I 
pursued my Comm Studies major, 
I said.
It still didn’t stop me from 
feeling like a hypocrite after all 
the impassioned speeches I’d 
given about women in STEM.
The existence of a woman of 
color is in and of itself an act of 
resistance.
It sounds like a way to allow 
all women of color to participate 

in social justice without some of 
the pitfalls of the “Social Justice” 
community, but to me...it sounds 
like an excuse.
It was my excuse whenever 
someone asked why I wasn’t 
attending a protest or signing a 
petition. I’d explain how there 
are many different forms of 
activism, and that I participated 
in what I could when I could. 
I’d explain how I wasn’t really a 
‘slacktivist’ because I was doing 
the little things in my day to day 
life like instigating dialogues 
with people who are unaware 
of their privilege. Or engaging 
in conversations with my white 
male housemates about issues 
women of color face.
It still didn’t stop me from 
feeling like a fraud every time I 
was too burnt out to educate and 
advocate.
The existence of a woman of 
color is in and of itself an act of 
resistance.
It sounds like a lovely way to 
support women of color with 
whatever they choose to do but to 
me...it sounds like an excuse.
It was my excuse whenever 
a friend asked why I engaged 
with 
anything 
problematic. 
The Marvel movies don’t have 
great representation but Tess 
Thompson just showed up in 
Thor 3, I’d claim. My favorite 
kpop group getting international 
fame is breaking cultural barriers 
despite the occasional cultural 
appropriation, I’d insist. Wearing 

makeup isn’t for anyone else, 
but for me, I’d cry. If I can only 
participate in things that are 
ethical and moral and just, then I 
won’t get to enjoy anything at all, 
I’d argue.
It didn’t stop me from feeling 
like a liar any time I’d get called 
out for my interests and hobbies
But as much as I may feel 
like a hypocrite, a fraud, a liar, I 
resist white supremacy and the 
patriarchy by choosing to exist 
and learn and grow and thrive.
The problem with the existence 
of a woman of color being an act 
of resistance is that it is my very 
existence that is questioned and 
policed and entirely undermined. 
My existence does not only reflect 
my own self but is then forced to 
reflect anyone who looks remotely 
like me. I am not allowed to simply 
exist, but I do anyway. I take up 
space, physical and vocal. I smile 
when I am happy, cry when I’m 
sad, rant when I’m angry, eat 
when I’m hungry and rest when 
I’m tired. I support other women 
of color. I try to be a good ally and 
a better activist.
The existence of a woman of 
color is in and of itself an act of 
resistance.
It’s not an excuse - it’s my battle 
chant.
Because I resist to exist.
Because I exist and I have no 
choice but to resist.
Because I am a woman of color.
I exist. 
I resist.

YKB 2018: Not cleared for landing

I like to think I’m a sexy 
woman. In fact, I know I’m a 
sexy woman. But, the problem is 
sex stresses me out. Not the stuff 
leading up to it. Not the hot make 
outs or the slow stripping. Just 
the bit where every bit of clothing 
is off and things are about to 
inserted in places and honestly 
it’s almost more stressful than 
midterm week. Almost.
Because 
the 
thing 
is, 
sexiness takes effort. Aside 
from the usual routines of 
makeup and well fit outfits, I 
have to go the extra mile. I’ve 
inherited gorgeous brown skin 
and beautiful black hair....that 
grows everywhere. Becoming 
sexy requires shaving my legs, 
using nair for my arms if the 
occasion is important enough, 
waxing off sideburns and upper 
lip hair and cheek hair and chin 
hair and of course, getting my 
eyebrows threaded. But then 
there’s that final, final step that 
terrifies me: nether region hair 
removal.

So the science says that 
you really shouldn’t remove 
your pubic hair – it’s there for 
a reason. But for a girl who’s 
heard so much shit about the 
hair that grows everywhere 
else...hair down there seems 
like an invitation for mockery. 
I mean, I’ve had a girl howl at 
me in the hallways at school, 
call me a werewolf because of 
the hair on my arms. Another 
boy made a comment about me 
having a mustache and I don’t 
think I’ll ever forget the sudden 
deep shame I felt. The shame I 
still manage to feel. I’m more 
ashamed of my body hair than I 
could ever be about sex.
But anyway, the point is, my 
yoni just seems like another 
body part on a list of body parts 
that has more hair than it needs. 
I mean so far I haven’t had any 
complaints about it but I always 
feel the need to warn anyone who 
ventures down there. It’s a bush, 
a forest, don’t get lost, keep your 
arms and legs in the vehicle at 
all times thank you, and now if 
we look a bit further south you 
can see the oasis you’ve been 
searching for. Whoa there, not 

that far south.
And, it’s not like I haven’t 
considered my options --- waxing 
is painful as fuck. Like, literally 
spreading hot wax around my 
vulva then using it to rip out 
hair by the follicles just so I feel 
comfortable enough for sex? 
In my opinion, the cost benefit 
analysis doesn’t work out, despite 
my mother’s teachings of “no 
pain, no gain.” Using a sharp 
blade down there doesn’t sound 
any better, not to mention the 
fact that my hair grows fast and 
I’d rather not give anyone carpet 
burn.
Yes, I can trim things but it 
doesn’t achieve the same effect of 
smooth hairlessness; I imagine it 
would feel much like the silkiness 
of my legs when I finally find a 
reason to shave in the winter. 
Or maybe it’ll just reveal more 
imperfections, like the breakouts 
and pores I find after removing 
the hair on my face. It seems I’ll 
never learn what it’s like to have 
a hairless pussy.
I suppose I’m just stuck for 
now.
A sex-stressed sexy woman.
Say that five times fast.

Like another road loss to a ranked 
team, the sight of a Michigan 
quarterback running for dear life 
is nothing new. Last year, it led to 
injuries for Wilton Speight and 
Brandon Peters. It nearly did the 
same to Shea Patterson on Saturday, 
as the junior quarterback missed 
parts of the fourth quarter with 
cramps after being pressured all 
night.
Officially, Patterson was sacked 
three times and hurried on another 
six occasions. In reality, though, it 
was much worse.
The Wolverines’ offensive tackles 
looked almost helpless. Patterson 
rarely received a clean pocket to 
throw from — pressure from the 
edge or Notre Dame stunts came 
almost instantaneously. It showed 
in Michigan’s offense: quick throws 
were its only reliable way of moving 
the ball, and the Wolverines had just 
three plays of 15 yards or more with 
one offensive touchdown. 
But 
during 
Monday’s 
press 
conferences, coach Jim Harbaugh 
said he wasn’t concerned — and 
rather encouraged — by his offensive 
line’s performance.
“I thought it was improved,” 
Harbaugh said. “We look at it and 
there was quite a few boxes that 
were checked (as) this is improved. 
We’ll continue to get better, but it 
was one of the areas I think we’re 
improving in.”
Michigan started Jon Runyan Jr. 

and Juwann Bushell-Beatty at tackle, 
along with Ben Bredeson, Cesar Ruiz 
and Michael Onwenu — left to right 
— on the interior Saturday. Despite 
a plethora of glaring mistakes and 
the presence of reserves like redshirt 
freshman tackle James Hudson 
and junior guard Stephen Spanellis, 
Harbaugh said he’ll stick with the 
same group next week against 
Western Michigan.
“I think the way we played this 
week is the way we’ll play the next 
game with the offensive line,” 
Harbaugh said.
Junior tight end Sean McKeon 
and sophomore wide receiver Nico 
Collins echoed similar positive 
sentiments about the group, noting 
that fall camp isn’t the same animal 
as the Fighting Irish’s elite front 
seven.
“I thought (the line) looked good,” 
McKeon said. “The offensive line, 
obviously, they gotta work to build 
chemistry maybe even more than 
they tried to build in camp. So just 
got to build more chemistry up 
front.”
Added Collins: “(It’s a) great 
o-line. I feel like the criticism they 
(get) shouldn’t be talked about 
because I know how hard they 
work.”
Harbaugh 
and 
his 
players’ 
comments heavily contrast what’s 
being said outside Schembechler 
Hall. 
Fans, 
understandably 
frustrated by Michigan’s fourth-
straight loss dating back to last 
season, were quick to scapegoat the 
offensive line for Saturday’s results.

And while there were other 
issues — defensive penalties and 
the spectacular play of Notre Dame 
quarterback 
Brandon 
Wimbush 
— the offensive line was the most 
detrimental by far. It cost the 
Wolverines the ball or points on four 
separate occasions.
In the first quarter, Patterson took 
a 17-yard sack that pushed Michigan 
out of redshirt sophomore kicker 
Quinn Nordin’s range. Later, on 
second-and-goal at the two, Notre 
Dame got to Patterson again, forcing 
the Wolverines to settle for a field 
goal. The Fighting Irish’s pressure 
was also pivotal to Patterson’s 
interception and fumble — though 
both were partially avoidable.
Despite those plays, however, 
Harbaugh was encouraged by his 
quarterback’s performance.
“The thing that stood out the 
most was his accuracy, location of 
the balls,” Harbaugh said. “He was 
accurate all game. 
… 
First time in a 
game 

situation, 
I thought he 
ran (the offense) 
extremely well.”
That’s 
precisely 
why Michigan’s offensive 
line play is so frustrating for fans. 
For all the flashes Patterson showed 

Saturday, he won’t realize his 
potential if a defensive lineman 
is constantly in his facemask 
two seconds after the snap. And 
it certainly won’t be realized if 
Patterson’s hurt.
Harbaugh said his line has 
“improved”, and to be fair, that’s a 
relative word. He could genuinely 
feel like it has taken a step up from 
last year.
But it wasn’t good enough 
Saturday. Not even close.
Michigan’s offensive 
line has a long way to 
go. And no amount 
of 
Harbaugh 
and his players 
singing kumbaya 
changes that.

Saying or Doing?
 
Michigan has talked about 
its positives from Saturday’s 
game, but the product on the 
field wasn’t so sterling.

LINE OF INQUIRY

MICHIGAN 17
NOTRE DAME 24

MARK CALCAGNO
Daily Sports Editor

A week ago, sophomore center Cesar 

Ruiz stood in front of reporters and made 

a proclamation.

“Our offensive line will be the one 

strength of our offense this year,” Ruiz 

said. When pressed with a follow-up, he 

doubled down.

“You’ll see.”

Saturday night, in Michigan’s 24-17 

season-opening loss to Notre Dame, 

anyone with two eyes and a television 

set saw plenty. They saw a quarterback 

constantly needing to evade oncoming 

rushers. They saw a normally potent 

rushing attack held to 58 yards on 33 

carries. They saw a group incessantly 

blown around like a tin roof in a 

hurricane.

For months, anyone who walked 

through 
Schembechler 
Hall 
was 

inundated with buzz about a new 

offensive line. Simplication from new 

offensive line coach Ed Warriner, they 

were told, was going to cure all ills from 

a group that finished 117th in adjusted 

sack rate.

So much for that.

“They brought a lot of blitzes at first,” 

reasoned junior running back Karan 

Higdon, “brought more guys than we 

can block.”

The 
statement 
— 
while 

mathematically true — belies the scarred, 

fatal flaw plaguing this program. The 

Wolverines’ offensive line is a problem 

that has no answer.

It will hold back an offense that is 

otherwise filled with playmakers. It will 

force schematic changes that mask its 

weakness. It could get its quarterback 

— who showed flashes of brilliance — 

injured. 

With Michigan in opposing territory 

at the end of the third quarter, hoping to 

close a double-digit gap, Notre Dame got 

a free rusher to junior quarterback Shea 

Patterson’s blindside. Patterson showed 

his elusiveness, evading a crunching hit, 

and scrambling for nine yards. 

One play later, the Fighting Irish ran a 

simple stunt, freeing a defensive lineman 

past Ruiz, and barreling through Higdon. 

Forced to release the ball early, Patterson 

heaved up a prayer as he was hit. Notre 

Dame defensive lineman Julian Okwara 

was waiting for the easy interception.

As he learned quickly, evade the 

swarming rush on one play, it’ll just be 

back the next.

“They got us on that one inside blitz 

that we didn’t pick up,” said Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh. “It was a good 

impression that their front was bringing 

the entire night. Some we blocked, yeah. 

Could we be better? Yes. We’ll work to 

improve.”

Added fifth-year senior defensive 

lineman Chase Winovich, when asked 

about the struggling unit: “I know 

they’re working hard. Just like myself 

and everybody else on this team, we’ve 

got corrections to be made. They’re a 

well-coached group of individuals and 

they’re going to be sure to leave those 

corrections moving forward.”

On this night in South Bend, the 

offensive line was far from the only 

reason for the loss. The defense over-

pursued on nearly every play in the first 

half, and paid dearly for it. Penalties 

mounted up — on both sides of the ball — 

to derail any semblance of momentum. 

At times, the offensive scheme looked 

familiarly bland. Notre Dame executed 

its game plan to perfection, pushing 

around the interior of Michigan’s defense 

like rag dolls.

There is reason to believe this team 

can mend those issues as the season 

progresses. There is no such reason to 

believe the offensive line will do the 

same.

Redshirt freshman James Hudson 

will undoubtedly see time as early as 

next week at one of the tackle spots, if for 

no other reason than there’s nothing to 

lose. Coaches and players have been sure 

to commend his talent during spring, 

with the competition for a starting spot 

coming down to the wire. He has the 

frame and athleticism. 

Freshman Jalen Mayfield might also 

get a shot, under the same whimsical 

rationale. He’s drawn rave reviews from 

the coaching staff and players.

But Harbaugh, Warriner and the 

rest of the coaching staff spent weeks 

of spring practice, offseason workouts 

and then fall practice, only to conclude 

MAX MARCOVITCH
Daily Sports Editor

that these were the five best offensive 

linemen to combat a formative Notre 

Dame front seven. To expect Hudson, 

Mayfield or any replacement to be a 

magic elixir would exceed naivety. 

Help will come the next couple 

weeks in the form of Western Michigan 

and SMU. Neither foe will offer 

Michigan anything resembling Notre 

Dame’s talented front seven. It could 

be a time to grow. It will certainly be a 

chance to see what the younger options 

have to offer.

“It’s the beginning,” Harbaugh said, 

when asked about his level of concern 

with the offense. “It’s the beginning for 

us. We’re not treating it like the end.”

But Saturday was a chance to back 

up the talk against a real opponent in a 

real environment against a real defense. 

Fans waited to see what Ruiz and the 

offensive line had in store. Saturday 

night, they got their fill. What they saw, 

though, was just more of the same.

The offensive line is not a strength, 

at least not yet. It is the common 

denominator luring an offense back into 

the familiar confines of mediocrity.

Far from promised improvement, o-line shows more of the same

Harbaugh, players defend offensive line

SportsTuesday: Saying or doing?
T

he fourth season of Jim 
Harbaugh’s tenure in 

Ann Arbor is 
off to a rocky 
start after a 
loss to Notre 
Dame.
Since, 
some 
unflattering 
stats have 
been 
advertised, 
like how the 
Wolverines are 9-9 in their last 
18 games and how they haven’t 
won a road game against a 
ranked opponent since 2006.
But fear not, Michigan fans, 
because there may be room for 
optimism.
On Monday afternoon, from 
defensive end Rashan Gary 
to VIPER Khaleke Hudson to 
tight end Sean McKeon to wide 
receiver Nico Collins, and even 
up to coach Jim Harbaugh, 
nothing but positives were 
pointed out. It was all eyes 
forward and downplaying the 
flaws that made the Wolverines 
0-1. 
“I think everybody inside 
of our team believes in each 
other and believes in the 
team, believes in each other,” 
Harbaugh said. “And stressing 
the importance of going from 
one week, to Week 1 to Week 
2, never more important than 
with this ballclub. So looking 
to make all the strides you can 
in this one week, and focusing 
on that. We’re focusing on this 
game, never a more important 
game than the one we’ll go 
down the tunnel to play this 
week.”
I know what you’re thinking: 
Mike, of course they pointed 
out positives, what else are they 
gonna say?
But just for kicks, let’s break 
down some of these positives.
First, there was the offensive 
line.
I thought I saw junior 

quarterback Shea Patterson 
and redshirt sophomore Dylan 
McCaffrey running for their 
lives, and Michigan’s rushing 
attack limited to just 58 yards 
on Saturday.
On Monday afternoon, 
though, Harbaugh said he 
thought the unit was much 
improved. Monday night, 
during the Inside Michigan 
Football Radio Show, Higdon 
went as far as to say that 
the offensive line is easy to 
criticize live, but that when you 
break down the film, they did 
some nice things — though he 
conceded that Notre Dame’s 
defensive line was better.
I will preface this by saying 
that I do not know even half as 
much about football as Higdon, 
or really anybody on the team. 
Also, I do not have all the angles 
and film breakdown capabilities 

that the Wolverines surely have.
But I did re-watch the game, 
and what I saw was Patterson 
and McCaffrey running for 
their lives for most of the game 
and Michigan’s rushing attack 
limited to just 58 yards. 
I would be curious to see 
what redshirt freshman tackle 
James Hudson could bring 
to the table, but Harbaugh 
was asked about that sort of a 
personnel change on Monday.
“I think the way we played 
this week is the way we’ll 
play the next game with the 
offensive line,” Harbaugh said, 
though I don’t think he would 
tell us if he was changing 
personnel.
Okay, let’s not dawdle on one 
aspect.
Another focus of Michigan’s 
shortcomings was its defense, 
which was exposed in the first 

half and put the Wolverines in 
a hole from which they couldn’t 
escape.
To that, Gary and Hudson 
had some answers.
“Not at all,” Gary said when 
asked if he could pinpoint the 
defense’s problems in the first 
half. “The only thing I can 
really say is we hurt ourselves. 
You know, only two, three 
plays, maybe four plays, can 
hurt you at the end of the game. 
That’s really what it came down 
to, and that’s just us hurting 
ourselves.”
Added Hudson: “Just self-
inflicted wounds was the 
reason why we lost. Just third 
down penalties and doing some 
of the stuff we normally do 
right.”
They are right on this one, as 
the second half was a showcase 
of just how dominant the 

defense can be. But the reasons 
for the shortcomings in the first 
half are a bit troubling.
Often times, Fighting Irish 
quarterback Brandon Wimbush 
and the offense took advantage 
of over-aggressiveness from 
Michigan’s defense. That 
showed in the untimely 
penalties the Wolverines 
incurred just as much as the 
quarterback runs and screen 
passes that were successful.
Of course, the other side of 
that coin is that Michigan is led 
by its fast and tough defense. 
And it’s also a program that has 
struggled to contain running 
quarterbacks for… ever?
Luckily there aren’t any 
other running quarterbacks on 
the schedule other than Ohio 
State’s Dwayne Haskins and 
Penn State’s Trace McSorley 
and Michigan State’s Brian 

Lewerke and Nebraska’s Adrian 
Martinez and Maryland’s 
Tyrrell Pigrome and Indiana’s 
Peyton Ramsey.
Okay, I’ll just hit on one more 
quote.
Sophomore wide receiver 
Nico Collins said the offensive 
gameplan was not the problem 
and that it doesn’t need to 
change moving forward.
The Wolverines failed to 
capitalize on opportunities 
all night long offensively, 
and, partially because of the 
offensive line, couldn’t come up 
with the explosive plays that 
some expected.
When the defense finally 
locked down in the second half, 
Patterson and company couldn’t 
figure out a way to climb back 
into the game all the way.
It feels like at least 
something could be done to 
help that. Maybe a new transfer 
quarterback? Maybe a new 
offensive line coach? Maybe 
two former NFL coaches calling 
the offensive shots?
I know, I’m getting greedy.
Now none of this is to say 
that Michigan can’t turn things 
around. It is still a roster loaded 
with talent, with a coach who 
has been to the Super Bowl in 
this decade.
But something has to change, 
no matter what the Wolverines 
say. The offensive line must 
improve, with personnel 
changes or without them. The 
defense has to be solid, and 
especially against dual-threat 
signal callers. The offense must 
get big plays, whether it’s with 
a better gameplan or better 
execution.
The stats are ugly for a 
reason. Michigan is saying the 
right things to avoid a mutiny, 
but there is no need for a 
mutiny if the ship sinks first.

Michigan falls short in season opener against Notre Dame, 24-17

SOUTH 
BEND, 
Ind. 
— 
After all the hype for Shea 
Patterson, the talk of returning 
starters, the assurances that 
the offensive line had improved 
and the general hype for the 
2018 Michigan football team, 
the Wolverines finally had their 
chance to prove that it wasn’t 
just hype on Saturday night 
against Notre Dame.
But in less than eight minutes, 
all of those hopes began to look 
more like pipe dreams.
It started on the first drive, 
when the 12th-ranked Fighting 

Irish used a few big plays to 
score in less than 90 seconds. 
Michigan punted, and at the end 
of Notre Dame’s next possession, 
the South Bend crowd was in 
hysterics once again.
Quarterback 
Brandon 
Wimbush lobbed a deep ball 
downfield, and Irish receiver 
Chris Hinke leaped over safety 
Brad Hawkins, hauling it in 
and putting the Wolverines in 
a hole. In the blink of an eye, it 
was 14-0.
No. 14 Michigan (0-1) spent 
the rest of its much-anticipated 
opener trying to play catch-up, 
but it never clawed back, losing, 
24-17.

“The guys really prepared 
well for this ballgame,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“Not the outcome we anticipated 
or wanted, but we’ve just got 
to dig deep, make no excuses. 
Credit to Notre Dame and move 
on to next week.”
It 
ultimately 
was 
the 
first 
half 
that 
did 
Michigan 
in. 
Notre 
Dame 
(1-0) 
scored 
again 
in 
the 
second 
quarter 
on a methodical, 
15-play 
march 
aided 
by 
penalties.
All 
the 
offensive 
production the Fighting Irish 
needed came before halftime.
“Second half I think we found 
our groove a little bit more,” 
said fifth-year senior defensive 
end Chase Winovich. “This 
might be a hot take. I don’t mean 
it to be. They’re a great football 
team and stuff, but I just didn’t 

feel like they dominated us. I 
just felt like they went up and 
made some 50/50 plays.”
Maybe Winovich is on to 
something, because there were 
several moments when it seemed 
like momentum was starting to 
turn in the Wolverines’ favor, but 
those 
moments 
never bred any 
substance.
Sophomore 
Ambry 
Thomas 
answered Notre 
Dame’s 
third 
touchdown 
with a 99-yard 
kick 
return 
touchdown 
on 
the 
next 
play, 
but 
halftime 
came before any 
momentum could be sustained.
In the second half, Michigan’s 
vaunted defense finally found 
its rhythm. They gave up 233 
yards in the first half and just 
71 in the second, but the offense 
flubbed its chances.
The Wolverines even drove 
down the field their first chance 

after halftime, highlighted by a 
54-yard bomb from Patterson to 
sophomore wide receiver Nico 
Collins. But that chance was 
thwarted when junior punter 
Will Hart bobbled the snap on a 
would-be field goal.
Then, 
fifth-year 
senior 
Brandon Watson 
intercepted a pass 
to give Michigan 
yet 
another 
opportunity 
to 
crawl back into 
things.
And yet again, 
the 
Wolverines 
couldn’t.
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
game, 
Michigan 
made 
one final push, 
scoring with just over two 
minutes to go on a short run 
from senior running back Karan 
Higdon. The Wolverines got the 
ball back moments later after 
forcing a three-and-out. 
But this time, Patterson, who 
finished the day 20-of-30 for 
227 yards and an interception, 

fumbled while running from 
a defender for the umpteenth 
time of the night. 
“Nobody really wants to start 
off like that,” Patterson said. 
“Our defense and our special 
teams put us in really good 
situations to make something 
happen. … Just 
gonna go back 
and learn from 
the tape.”
The offensive 
line, which was 
already 
being 
questioned, 
could 
never 
consistently 
keep Patterson 
upright. 
The 
offense 
that 
struggled 
all 
of last season fell short when it 
counted.
The Wolverines left South 
Bend with many of the problems 
they said they had fixed.
The season isn’t over — not by 
a long shot.
But the hype? The hype is all 
but gone.

Collins inspires confidence from his teammates in No. 2 receiving role 

Amid fans airing grievances 
after 
the 
Michigan 
football 
team’s 24-17 loss at Notre Dame, 
it was difficult to focus on 
anything but the negatives of the 
Wolverines’ performance.
But with 48 hours to digest 
Saturday night’s game, a big 
picture outlook of Michigan 
football is in order. Or in other 
words, every cloud has a silver 
lining.
It was Week 1, with new 
offensive pieces, against a ranked 
team, in the Fighting Irish’s 
own stadium, nonetheless. The 
defense, especially in the second 
half, 
was 
mostly 
consistent 
and junior quarterback Shea 
Patterson showed glimpses of 
why he was already a fan favorite.
But no player took a leap and 
inspired new confidence like 
sophomore wide receiver Nico 
Collins.
“He seems to be catching 
everything,” said junior left 
guard Ben Bredeson prior to 
Saturday’s game, a foretell of 
his expanded role. “I’m no wide 
receivers coach here … but it 
seems 
like 
whenever 
we’re 
getting into the red zone or 
something like that — we need a 
touchdown — Nico is usually the 
guy getting it for us.”
The 
6-foot-4 
Collins 
was 
thrown into the No. 2 spot on the 
depth chart after Tarik Black’s 
foot injury. Hype swirled around 
as chatter surfaced about what 
the unproven Collins could do to 
fill the void left by Black.
“Before he got hurt, we always 
talked about what we would do in 
a game together — celebrations 
and whatever we had,” Collins 
said. “When he went down, our 
receivers got together and was 
like ‘Alright, let’s do it for Tarik.’ ”
Collins didn’t find the end 
zone on Saturday, but hauled in 
three catches for 66 yards in his 
starting debut — he tallied just 

three catches for 27 yards all of 
last season. The numbers don’t 
pop, but Collins proved his worth.
On 
the 
Wolverines’ 
first 
offensive drive of the season, 
Collins caught Patterson’s first 
passing attempt at Michigan 
with 
a 
trips 
screen 
pass, 
barreling eight yards after the 
catch through junior tight end 
Sean McKeon’s blocks.
To begin the second quarter, 
Collins was split left, and caught 
a six-yard slant for the first down 
inside the red zone.
And for his final reception, 

to start the second half, Collins 
outran Notre Dame cornerback 
Julian Love on a deep post 
and snagged an underthrown, 
52-yard heave.
“Loved the big play,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“Thought he did a great job of 
running his route, burst of speed 
and did a great job of tracking the 
ball — and that fantastic catch.
“Blocked well and consistently 
ran good routes the whole game.”
Added Collins: “It meant a 
lot to this team. We made an 
adjustment at the halftime. After 

I caught that we were just like 
‘Okay, let’s go score the ball.’ 
Made a little spark to the offense, 
move the ball.”
For Collins, the promotion 
was 
quick, 
but 
seamless. 
Another year corrected a lot of 
mental lapses according to him, 
and being the next man up is 
something he’s been ready for 
since the spring.
“Last year I wasn’t ready, didn’t 
really know anything my first 
year,” Collins said. “The playbook 
is a whole different level than 
what I was used to in high school. 

Just having that first year under 
my belt, learning from freshman 
year, it kinda brought a little juice 
to me in the spring.”
But it wasn’t Collins’ own 
development that improved, but 
his connection with Patterson. 
According to Collins, Patterson 
is unlike any quarterback he has 
played with before, a proposition 
that forced Collins to change his 
attitude when running routes.
“With him, the play isn’t 
over,” Collins said. “We’re all 
trying to find ways to get open. 
Scramble drill and find the open 

spot. … He’s a really explosive 
quarterback. He can find ways to 
get the ball to you and find ways 
to make plays.”
For an otherwise stagnant 
offense, Collins’ consistency was 
a flower in a dirt field. Losing 
Black, of course, was painful. But 
after 60 minutes of Collins in the 
starting rotation, Black’s absence 
did not seem like a make-or-
break loss. For a Michigan team 
looking to rebound, it can be 
thankful that it has at least one 
less issue that doesn’t need 
urgent help.

Sophomore wide receiver Nico Collins says he “wasn’t ready” and “didn’t really know anything (his) first year,” but his leading receiving performance on Saturday shows how far he has come since.

A different kind of pain

S

OUTH BEND, Ind. — 

The gift-
wrapping 
was pretty 
on the 
Michigan 
football 
team.
Through 
talk of 
renewed 
confidence, 
heightened athleticism 
and, finally, a serviceable 
quarterback, the 14th-ranked 
Wolverines were supposed 
to have a fighting chance 
against No. 12 Notre Dame in 
South Bend.
But right at kickoff of 
Saturday night’s season 
opener, the grandeur of it all 
had faded without return. 
That gift-
wrapping was 
a photocopy of 
the rhythmless, 
frustrating 
Michigan 
team from last 
year. The only 
difference 
was that the 
2018 team had 
everything 
it needed to 
succeed, and it still didn’t in 
its 24-17 loss to the Fighting 
Irish (1-0 overall).
“Just a few (big plays), not 
enough,” said a stone-faced 
Jim Harbaugh in the post-
game press conference. “We 
didn’t make enough explosive 
plays, we didn’t run the ball 
as well as we would like.
“I don’t really have all the 
biggest takeaways. I thought 
on defense our guys played 
fast, competed hard. There’s 
improvements to be made, 
mistakes were made but I 
thought they fought hard.”
With 1:48 remaining, 
down by a touchdown, the 
Wolverines (0-1) looked to 
put that narrative to bed and 
place the pieces for another 
rivalry classic. But on the 
fourth play of the drive, the 
offensive line collapsed and 
the football was knocked out 
of Shea Patterson’s hands into 
those of Notre Dame’s Khalid 
Kareem to seal the game. 
Throughout the contest, the 
Wolverines wore the mental 
anguish of an early 14-0 
deficit on their sleeve in a 
loss it could have avoided.
“It’s one of those things 

where you come off the 
sideline like ‘where did we 
go wrong?’ ” said fifth-year 
senior defensive end Chase 
Winovich. “ I didn’t feel 
like they were dominating. I 
didn’t feel like their presence 
was overwhelming.”
It’s the same result. A 
different kind of pain. One 
rooted in its potential to be 
everything that the 2017 team 
wasn’t.
Last year’s Michigan team 
carried few expectations, 
excepting the rabid fan 
pacing in front of their 
television. A quarterback 
carousel behind a porous 
offensive line made the 
Wolverines’ offense an 
eyesore.
When Michigan’s defense 
could no longer carry the 
rest of the team’s water 
and it lost, 
exasperation 
trumped 
anger. The 
offense was 
that bad — 
Michigan had 
no business 
winning in 
any of its 
defeats and 
that sobering 
feeling of 
acceptable pain persisted.
Flash forward to Sept. 1 
at Notre Dame Stadium, and 
the loss was still deserved, 
yet more unsettling than 
it would have 
been 365 days 
ago. In junior 
Shea Patterson 
looked a capable 
offensive 
torchbearer 
while 
sophomore 
wide receivers 
Donovan 
Peoples-Jones 
and Nico Collins 
— who hauled a 52-yard 
bomb thanks to solid pass 
protection — took the next 
step to be viable receiving 
options. The whole defense 
showed spurts of why they 
belonged in the discussion as 
the nation’s best defense.
But none of it mattered. 
On Saturday, it was one step 
forward, two steps back.
“The first game is always 
the toughest because no 
matter how hard your camp 
is, that first game is always 
tougher,” Winovich said. 
“I feel like they maybe did 

a better job adapting to it 
and took advantage of our 
lack of whatever - not being 
prepared enough.”
On three different 
occasions after a third down 
stand, Michigan’s defense 
was penalized to extend 
the Fighting Irish’s drives. 
All three of Notre Dame’s 
touchdowns came from those 
instances. The ejection of 
junior safety Josh Metellus 
from an early targeting call 
exacerbated the defensive 
deficiencies.
The Wolverines made it 
into the red zone just twice 
in the first three quarters, 
converting only one field goal 
and botching the attempt on 
the other.
Sophomore Ambry Thomas 
had a 99-yard kickoff 
return touchdown to bring 
the halftime deficit to a 
manageable 21-10 margin. 
Michigan didn’t find paydirt 
again until it was too little, 
too late.
“Nobody really wants to 
start off like that,” Patterson 
said. “Our defense put us in 
situations to make something 
happen. Early on, I took a 
sack that put us out of field 
goal range, I threw a careless 
pick. And at the end of the 
game, ball security.”
Added Winovich: “I’m not 
really sure where they beat 
us, I’m still confused in the 
locker room. I’m just kinda 
confused how 
we lost that 
game. I didn’t 
feel like they 
dominated us, 
but ultimately 
they made 
plays when 
they needed 
to.”
In a game 
where the 
Fighting Irish 
were doing everything in 
their power to let Michigan 
come back, it never came. 
Of course, it is only the first 
game and that potential may 
still emanate down the road. 
But Saturday night’s miscues 
were expected to happen in 
the 2017 season. It wasn’t 
supposed to happen in 2018.
But both are losses. This 
one just stings the Wolverines 
a little bit more.

Defense suffers untimely mistakes 
against Fighting Irish in South Bend

SOUTH BEND, Ind. 
— As 
the 43-yard rainbow heave 
approached 
the 
endzone, 
Brad Hawkins sensed an 
interception. But just as the 
sophomore 
safety 
lurched 
his hands above his head 
to make the play, receiver 
Chris 
Finke 
snatched the 
pass away for 
Notre Dame’s 
second 
touchdown of 
the evening.
It 
was 
emblematic of 
the mistakes 
that 
cost 
Michigan’s 
defense 
on 
Saturday 
in 
South Bend: not glaring in 
nature but made in moments 
that proved costly.
Just take what happened 
earlier in that drive. On 
third-and-nine 
deep 
in 
Fighting 
Irish 
territory, 
safety 
Josh 
Metellus 
led 
with his head trying to knock 
down a pass, adding 15-yards 
to the Notre Dame reception 
and forcing an early exit for 
the junior.
Four snaps later, Brandon 
Wimbush 
underthrew 
Finke, but — inexperienced 
and fresh onto the field to 
replace Metellus — Hawkins 
couldn’t 
complete 
the 
interception. And just like 
that, the Wolverines found 
themselves down 14-0.
“(Wimbush) 
made 
plays, 
and 
ultimately 
we 
didn’t,” 
said 
fifth-year 
senior defensive end Chase 
Winovich. 
“That’s 
what 
football’s all about — making 
plays when you need to.”
And 
all 
too 
often, 
especially in the first half, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
couldn’t stop Notre Dame 
from making those plays.
Despite previous accuracy 
concerns, Wimbush stared 
down Michigan’s pressure, 

completing 
crossing 
patterns over the middle or 
deep seam routes for clutch 
conversions. His legs helped, 
too, 
extending 
plays 
and 
evading defenders for extra 
yards.
This 
combination 
was 
especially 
effective 
in 
continuing drives, as the 
Fighting Irish went 5-for-8 
on third down 
during 
the 
first 
half. 
No 
matter 
what 
the Wolverines 
threw 
at 
Wimbush, 
he 
answered 
the 
bell.
And 
sometimes, 
Michigan 
just gave it to 
Notre 
Dame, 
too. 
Including 
Metellus’ 
ejection, five penalties (42 
yards) were accepted against 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
on 
Saturday.
None was more detrimental 
than a roughing-the-passer 
call 
late 
in 
the 
second 
quarter against Winovitch. 
After 
momentarily 
getting a stop 
on 
third-
and-goal, the 
penalty 
gave 
the 
Fighting 
Irish a fresh 
set of downs 
and, 
later, 
four 
points 
on 
a 
Jafar 
Armstrong 
touchdown run.
“I didn’t necessarily agree 
with this call because I 
was rushing from the left 
side — he’s a right-handed 
quarterback — (the referee) 
told me I hit him in the back, 
and that’s why they called 
it,” Winovich said. “Not sure 
how that makes any sense.”
It 
all 
culminated 
in 
defensive shredding in the 
first half — Notre Dame 
racked up 233 total yards 
and 21 points — far from the 

norm for Michigan’s defense.
Still, things quieted down 
in the second half, when 
the Wolverines allowed less 
than 70 yards and a lone 
field goal. Winovich already 
recognizes this as a change 
from last year’s team.
“I think last year, things 
went 
(astray),” 
Winovich 
said. “You see it in the South 
Carolina game. I think if we 
had that mindset, I think 
they could’ve really done 
some damage on us.”
Michigan’s 
defense 
was 
supposed to be its greatest 
strength. It has been the 
last four seasons, finishing 
inside the top ten in yards 
allowed 
from 
2014-2017. 
And nine returning starters 
from last year’s defense 
— including potential first 
round picks Rashan Gary, 
Devin Bush, Khaleke Hudson 
and Lavert Hill — made for 
lofty preseason expectations 
around an offense with a 
new identity. 
“I 
definitely 
feel 
that 
pressure,” 
Winovich 
said. 
“That’s just the way it’s been 
(from a) factual standpoint. 
It’s 
been 
a 
defensive-led 
group the last 
couple years.”
But 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
— 
between 
penalties 
and 
third 
downs 
— 
certainly 
had its share 
of 
lapses 
on 
Saturday. And when those 
mistakes are compounded 
with plays like that of Finke 
and Wimbush, it makes for a 
losing formula.
“It’s one of those things 
where you come off the 
sideline, and for me, I didn’t 
know 
where 
we 
(went) 
wrong,” Winovich said. “I 
didn’t feel like they were 
dominating, I didn’t feel like 
they were overwhelming us. 
They made plays and beat 
us.”

Field hockey splits against UMass and UConn

Maggie Bettez had Friday’s 
game circled on her calendar for 
two years.
The 
senior 
midfielder 
is 
originally from Acton, Mass., but 
the Michigan field hockey team 
hadn’t played in her home state 
during her college career until this 
past weekend. Her friends and 
family came out to cheer her on, a 
moment she won’t soon forget.
And 
the 
game 
didn’t 
disappoint, 
either. 
The 
fifth-
ranked Wolverines (1-3 overall) 
picked up their first win of the 
season 
against 
Massachusetts 
(2-2), commanding the game from 
the start in a 5-0 victory.
Despite not scoring until the 
25th minute — when senior 
forward Emma Way launched 
a reverse shot that found the 
back of the cage — Michigan 
smothered the Minutewomen. 
Massachusetts had just two shots 
the entire game and failed to draw 

a single penalty corner.
The Wolverines complemented 
that defense with an offensive 
onslaught. 
Sophomore 
back 
Halle O’Neill and senior back 
Regan Leavitt both scored goals 
after corners. Junior forward 
Meg Dowthwaite 
tallied 
her 
first 
goal of the season 
late in the first half 
and Way added to 
the tally early in 
the second.
“The 
first 
four games this 
year 
were 
all 
very 
challenging 
and we’ve been 
knocking 
on 
the 
doorstep 
of 
winning for the whole year so far,” 
Bettez said. “So to get the first win 
was … a confidence booster and it 
came at a good time for us.”
The victory came just in time for 
the Wolverines’ Sunday matchup 
with No. 1 Connecticut (4-0), the 
reigning national champion. But 

Michigan wasn’t fazed by the top 
competition. Though they lost, 
2-1, the Wolverines used their 
underdog status to take risks with 
their game, several of which paid 
off.
“We wanted to go right at 
them,” 
Bettez 
said. “We played 
confident rather 
than 
worrying 
about each little 
play.”
When 
Way 
stole 
the 
ball 
from a Husky 
defender 
and 
punched it in the 
goal less than 
five minutes into 
the game, it only 
bolstered that confidence.
At first, Michigan was able to 
fend off Connecticut’s relentless 
pressure. Freshman goalkeeper 
Anna Spieker made 11 saves 
and the corner defense kept the 
Huskies from scoring on their first 
eight penalty opportunities.

“(Spieker) made some really 
key saves,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “Made some 
wonderful decisions back there, 
just played with a lot of confidence, 
so I think that helps our defense 
feel confident.”
But early in the second half, 
the Huskies evened the score on 
a rebound after a save and scored 
the winning goal off a penalty 
corner with 10 minutes remaining. 
Michigan could only manage a 
lone corner and one shot on goal 
the entire period.
The Wolverines scored first 
and led for over half the game, 
but 
Connecticut 
dominated 
possession 
throughout. 
That 
was the dichotomy that made 
Michigan’s loss seem at once 
a 
disappointment 
and 
an 
inevitability.
“We took a lot away that we can 
build on,” Bettez said. “… Playing a 
full 70 minutes. We have spurts of 
fantastic play (but) it’s important 
to be consistent for the entire 
game.”

Michigan shut out by 
Wake Forest on road

The ball sailed from the 
corner towards the center of 
the scrum, right to the waiting 
Janiece Joyner. The freshman 
defender leaped into the air to 
head the ball into the goal in 
the 22nd minute.
But the ball went wide of 
the net by mere inches, and 
the Michigan women’s soccer 
team’s 
chance 
at 
scoring 
was gone. The rest of the 
game proved barren for the 
Wolverines, as they lost to 
Wake Forest, 4-0, on Thursday.
“Disappointed in the result 
tonight,” said Michigan coach 
Jennifer Klein in a statement, 
the only comment provided 
after the loss. “Never a good 
feeling to lose but hopefully 
this game is a moment for us 
as a team to regroup, refocus 
and 
improve 
in our areas of 
weakness. This 
will make us 
better.”
For the first 
26 minutes, the 
game appeared 
to 
be 
evenly 
matched. 
Neither 
the 
Wolverines 
nor the Demon 
Deacons were 
generating 
scoring 
chances 
— Michigan had no shots to 
Wake Forest’s one. But when 
the Demon Deacons scored 
their first goal, the floodgates 
opened.
In the 26th minute, fifth-
year senior forward Taylor 
Timko defended Wake Forest’s 
Estelle Laurier in the top 
corner of the field, trying to 
prevent her from getting a 
shot on goal. Laurier was able 
to sneak past Timko and found 
her 
teammate 
— 
forward 
Ryanne Brown — for the finish 

into the net.
Fifty-five 
seconds 
later, 
the Demon Deacons scored 
again — this time, Laurier 
found twine from 10 yards 
out. The Wolverines regained 
possession and charged down 
the field but were caught 
offsides.
In 
total, 
Michigan 
was 
offsides 
seven 
times 
throughout 
the 
game 
— 
including five in the first half. 
It could have been a sign of an 
offense trying to gain some 
momentum and pushing just a 
bit too fast, but it could also be 
symptomatic of a young team 
trying to find footing in its 
first road game of the year.
The Wolverines’ starting 11 
included four sophomores and 
a freshman — already a fairly 
young lineup. But Michigan’s 
youth showed further, as it 
substituted in a total of eight 
players. Four of 
the eight subs 
were freshmen 
and 
just 
one 
— 
redshirt 
junior 
Katie 
Foug — was an 
upperclassman.
The frequent 
substitutions 
by Klein show 
signs that the 
young 
team 
isn’t 
settled 
yet. 
The 
offense 
visibly 
lacked 
chemistry, 
with 
passes frequently missing the 
intended target. It took until 
late in the second half for 
the Wolverines to penetrate 
the 
Wake 
Forest 
defense 
and create real chances to 
score. By then, the Demon 
Deacons’ four-goal lead was 
insurmountable.

Given 
Michigan’s 

inexpereince, 
it 
may 
take 
time for it to build chemistry 
and find its stride — just as it 
showed in Thursday’s loss.
