Jonathan Vaughn, a former 

University of Michigan running 
back, has been camping in a tent 
outside of University President 
Mark Schlissel’s residence on South 
University Avenue for more than six 
days, as of Oct. 14. 

Vaughn, a survivor of late athletic 

doctor 
Robert 
Anderson, 
said 

he’ll stay there rain or shine until 
Schlissel and the regents commit to 
meet with him and other Anderson 
survivors. 

He is also spreading awareness of 

the now 2,000 known accusations 
of abuse by Anderson and calling 
on the University to support other 
survivors. A crowd of more than 

100 joined Vaughn on Oct. 14 in 
front of the President’s house to 
protest the University’s handling 
of the allegations against Anderson 
and demand greater transparency 
and support for sexual misconduct 
victims. 

The vigil was organized in 

response to a Sept. 23 Board 
of Regents meeting, in which 
no University official verbally 
acknowledged 
the 
attendance 

of hundreds of former student-
athletes who were survivors of 
Anderson. 

Survivors of both Anderson 

and former Michigan State doctor 
Larry Nassar have been expressing 
their support for Vaughn around 
South University Avenue since 
Oct. 8. When they gathered, many 
chanted phrases such as “We are 
not ashamed anymore,” “We are all 

victorious” and “Wake up Mark.” 

In an interview with The 

Michigan 
Daily, 
Vaughn 
said 

despite sleeping outside Schlissel’s 
house since the night of Oct. 8 and 
seeing him come and go from work 
every day, he hasn’t heard from 
the University’s administration. 
Vaughn said he hoped the protest 
helps bring awareness to sexual 
misconduct and fosters a safer 
on-campus community. 

“The goal of tonight is freeing, is 

empowering, is showing solidarity 
for the Dr. Robert Anderson victims 
as well as all the students who 
feel like this University doesn’t 
properly treat … sexual assault and 
sexual abuse cases,” Vaughn said. 
“Although (the University) might 
be the number one public university 
in the world, it also has students, 
young ladies and young men who 

say it’s not a safe place for them to go 
to college.” 

In an email to The Daily, 

University 
spokesperson 
Rick 

Fitzgerald wrote that, while the 
University was appreciative of the 
survivors’ bravery for stepping out, 
they are unable to comment on 
ongoing litigation. Fitzgerald also 
wrote that the University remains 
committed 
to 
providing 
fair 

compensation for the survivors. 

“We hear all of the survivors of 

the late Dr. Robert Anderson’s abuse 
and we thank them for their bravery 
in coming forward,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “We also are working toward 
fair compensation for the Anderson 
survivors through the confidential, 
court-supervised mediation process 
that is continuing.” 

The Michigan Daily put together 

a local election guide to help voters 
understand what will be on the ballot 
for the Nov. 2 Ann Arbor special 
election. Voters will consider four 
ballot proposals, outlined below as 
Proposals A through D.

Absentee Voting & Ballot Drop 

Box Locations 

Residents who wish to vote by 

mail or with any designated voter 
registration agency must register to 
do so by Oct. 18. Voters may request 
an absentee ballot here. After Oct. 
18,voters may still register in person 
at the City Clerk’s Office with proof 
of residency until 8 p.m. Nov. 2.

Voters must return ballots no later 

than 8 p.m. on Election Day, though 
the City Clerk’s Office recommends 
voters return ballots in advance. 
Any Ann Arbor resident voting by 
absentee ballot can return their 
ballot at the following drop box 
locations:

- Inside Larcom City Hall, 301 E. 

Huron St., at the north entrance

- Outside Larcom City Hall on 

Ann Street, located by the customer 
service drop box on the north side of 
Ann Street and east of Fifth Avenue.

- 
Parking 
lot 
at 
Veterans 

Memorial Park Ice Arena and Pool, 
2150 Jackson Ave.

- Outside Ann Arbor Fire Station 

5, 1946 Beal Ave. 

- Outside Cobblestone Farm/

Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation 
Customer Service Center, 2781 
Packard Rd.

- Outside Ann Arbor Fire Station 

6 at Eisenhower entrance, northwest 

side of building, 1881 Briarwood Circle.

Proposal 
A: 
Best 
Value 

Purchasing

In July, the Ann Arbor City 

Council approved a city charter 
amendment in hopes of allowing 
city staff to better assess the quality 
of bidders for public improvement 
projects.

If passed, this proposal would 

require the city of Ann Arbor 
to award contracts for supplies, 
materials or public improvements 
based on “best value” instead of 
going with the lowest responsible 
bidder, meaning someone who is 
able to satisfactorily perform the 
work but at the lowest price. 

The amendment enables the 

city to prioritize other factors when 
considering 
contracts, 
such 
as 

references from previous jobs and 
the size, complexity and success of 
past projects.

The city will also take into account 

whether the bidder aligns with 
labor protections, such as quality of 
employee benefits, and whether the 
bidder engages in an apprenticeship 
program for its employees. Under 
this proposal, the city will also assess 
any past violations of state, local or 
federal employee protection laws.

Proposal B: Ranked Choice 

Voting for the Election of City 
Officers 

If approved, this proposal would 

allow Ann Arbor voters to elect 
candidates for mayor and Ann Arbor 
City Council through ranked-choice 
voting in the primary and general 
election, if the state of Michigan 
authorizes this voting system.

November ballot?

Survivors of the late University doctor Robert Anderson protested with supporters Oct. 14 to demand greater transparency and support for sexual misconduct victims. 

CAMPUS LIFE

Crowd of more than 100 demand accountability from University administration

KRISTINA ZHENG

Daily News Editor

With the majority of libraries 

at the University of Michigan now 
operating on limited hours, some 
students say the adjusted schedule 
has created constraints on their 
study habits.

The University of Michigan 

closed all libraries in March 2020 
as campus shut down due to the 
COVID-19 
pandemic. 
Though 

libraries 
have 
since 
resumed 

in-person services, they have yet 
to return to pre-pandemic hours. 
No library on campus is available 
between 12 a.m. and 9 a.m.

Business 
sophomore 
Kayla 

Rothstein said though she typically 
studies at her sorority house, she 
decided to switch to the U-M 
libraries as midterms began. 

Rothstein said the libraries’ 

limited hours restrict her ability 
to study and make finding an open 
study spot difficult during later 
hours when only a few libraries 
remain open. 

“Hatcher 
(Graduate 
Library), 

which is where I prefer to study, is 
only open from 9:00-7:00, which I 
personally find pretty restrictive,” 
Rothstein said. “Yesterday, I was 
studying at Hatcher and it closed 
at seven, so then I went to Shapiro 
(Undergraduate 
Library) 
and 

I couldn’t find a table because 
everyone from Hatcher had moved 
to Shapiro.”

Alan 
Piñon, 
U-M 
Library 

director of communication and 
marketing,wrote in an email to The 
Michigan Daily that the library is 
aware of frustrations surrounding 
library hours and is working to 

expand them going forward, but 
they still face staffing shortages.

“Our biggest challenge with 

returning hours to pre-pandemic 
levels is staffing,” Piñon wrote. “We 
had some full-time staff attrition 
over the pandemic, but our largest 
shortfall is student workers. To 
stabilize things going forward, we 
plan to add more full-time staff so 
we’re less reliant on students.”

According to Piñon the Hatcher 

and Shapiro Libraries will both 
start opening an hour earlier at 8 
a.m. on Oct. 20. Starting Oct. 22, 
the Hatcher Library will also start 
opening on Saturdays from 10 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. The Shapiro Library will 
also open 24/7 from Dec. 11-17 to 
accommodate University study days 
and final exams. 

Labor shortages have become a 

common motif across campus and in 
local Ann Arbor businesses as more 
students return to campus without 
the labor supply to support it. At the 
beginning of the semester, students 
faced long lines for buses due to 
difficulties in hiring bus drivers.

Other 
students 
have 
said 

the 
library 
hours 
aren’t 
too 

inconvenient. LSA freshman Ava 
Rapp said though she uses the 
Shapiro Library frequently, she does 
not feel restricted by the libraries’ 
hours because she wouldn’t use the 
library late at night anyway. 

“I work at Bert’s, so I’m here (at 

Shapiro Library) almost every day,” 
Rapp said. “I haven’t really been 
interrupted because I wouldn’t be 
walking around that much when it’s 
super late anyway.”

Students struggle to find late night study spaces

Partners of the A2GO Initiative 

gathered at the Kerrytown Farmers 
Market the morning of Oct. 12 
to announce the launch of a new 
autonomous vehicle shuttle service. 

May Mobility, a start-up at the 

University and the company that 
created new shuttle service, is the 
first autonomous vehicle company 
to shuttle passengers in Ann Arbor, 
running from Kerrytown to the south 
of downtown Ann Arbor. The shuttle 
fleet consists of four hybrid Lexus 
SUVs and one wheelchair-accessible 
vehicle. The service will operate 
from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Monday 
through Friday along prescribed 
routes in downtown Ann Arbor, 
circling between their 21 designated 
stops. 

Each car is supervised by an 

Autonomous Vehicle Operator sitting 
in the driver’s seat. The operators 
are there for safety, manually 
driving the vehicles around unusual 
situations, like a double-parked car 
or making an unprotected left turn 
across traffic. They also speak with 
Mobility employees at the Ann Arbor 
headquarters to report hiccups in the 
driving experience, like problems on 
the road or using the app. 

Edwin Olson, May Mobility CEO 

and U-M Electrical Engineering 
and Computer Science professor 
currently on leave, said at the event 
that Ann Arbor was a great place for 
a company like his to grow. Olson 
said May Mobility’s headquarters in 
Ann Arbor created more than 20 new 
jobs with this shuttle service launch 
since its public announcement in 
September. 

“Ann Arbor is a great place to look 

for really experienced technicians, as 
well as people who are just getting 
started,” Olson said. “The University 
of Michigan continues to be a real 
source of talent and partnership for 
us.”

Olson 
said 
May 
Mobility’s 

partnership with the City of Ann 
Arbor began long before this week’s 
launch. The collaboration helped May 
Mobility determine the service area 
of their vehicles based on a number of 
factors, including speed limit, street 
density and traffic congestion. 

“We like to do things with cities, 

not to them,” Olson said. “So, it’s really 
important to figure out who are the 
stakeholders (and) how do you make 
sure that the people who you’re trying 
to serve are part of the conversation 
from the very beginning.” 

Greg McGuire, associate director 

at MCity — a research center at the 
University focused on autonomous 
driving — echoed the need to reflect 
on the broader implications of 
autonomous vehicles in Ann Arbor. 

“We’re 
interested 
in 
the 

engineering challenges, yes, but 
I think just as important is their 
potential societal impact,” McGuire 
said. “We want to build a better 
world, (and) learning by doing is a 
requirement. A2GO helps MCity 
go from our academic labs at the 
University to a living lab in the city of 
Ann Arbor.” 

Olson spoke of May Mobility’s 

prioritization of safety first, which 
aligns with the need for supervised 
autonomous driving at this time. 

“Safety is number one, and our 

second priority is experience for 
both the people in the car and people 
around us,” Olson said. “We want 
to make sure that we’re not holding 
up traffic or that we’re not being a 
nuisance to other people going about 

their lives. Then autonomy is third.”

Engineering senior Ryan Krawec 

rode in one of May Mobility’s vehicles 
on Oct. 12 and said he was not put off 
by the supervised driving.

“ 
”The car drove very human-like, 

and I couldn’t tell if the driver was 
driving or if the car was driving,” 
Krawec said. “When we stopped at a 
left turn, I asked the driver if he was 
driving and the driver said he was. 
But I wasn’t that surprised because 
I know autonomous vehicles are not 
fully self-driving yet.” 

Krawec 
said 
he 
believes 

autonomous vehicles can reduce the 
number of fatal car accidents. 

“I think autonomous vehicles are 

going to be a great thing for society,” 
Krawec said. “Right now most car 
accidents are caused by humans. In 
the future, if we can eliminate those 
accidents caused by humans, then we 
can save lives.”

Olson said May Mobility is 

also concerned with the safety of 
pedestrians outside of their vehicle. 
One of their partners, !important 
Safety Technologies, is an auto 
collision safety software company 
whose technology is incorporated 
into May Mobility’s vehicles. Hannah 
Osborn, director of New Business 
Development at !important Safety 
Technologies, said their software 
alerts nearby May Mobility vehicles if 
there is a pedestrian nearby. 

“People associate phones with 

distracted driving and distracted 
walking,” Osborn said. “Let’s turn 
that around and use it to protect 
them. With our software, you’re able 
to turn your phone essentially into a 
beacon to let others know that you’re 
there.”

However, to alert the vehicle by 

taking over the brakes, for example, 
the pedestrian needs to be a user of the 

!important Safety Technologies app, 
which Osborn said she recognizes is 
a barrier. 

“We’re also realistic, so we are 

partnering with companies that 
are also in the safety space — for 
example, insurance companies — 
and we are incorporating our alerts 
through their apps where their users 
have already given permission to be 
tracked,” Osborn said. 

Olson said to the crowd at the 

farmers market that his broader 
vision of May Mobility is to be 
environmentally 
conscious 
and 

socially accessible. 

“If you end up with segmentation 

in your transportation system, you 
end up with crappy systems that don’t 
work well,” Olson said. “I think the 
key thing is, how do you get everyone 
to use public transit? … It’s really 
important to us to figure out how (to) 
serve all kinds of people.”

In preparation for its launch, May 

Mobility held a contest in September 
for a “creative, clever and memorable 
name” for one of their vehicles, with 
the only rule being that it must start 
with the letter “M.”

Michigan 
Medicine 
assistant 

professor Alecia Daunter won the 
contest with the name “Mayble,” 
combining May Mobility with “able” 
to highlight the desire of her patients 
with sensory, cognitive and physical 
disabilities 
to 
achieve 
mobility 

independence. 

“The goal is really that people are 

participating in their communities 
with their friends and family and 
they’re able to experience all the 
same things around the city that 
anyone else would, using the same 
technology that everyone else is 
using,” Daunter said.

Instructors 
across 
campus 

are expressing concerns about 
COVID-19 protocols currently 
in place despite being told the 
classroom is “the safest place to 
be on campus” by University of 
Michigan administration. 

Among those concerned is 

Rackham student Ryan Glauser, 
co-chair of the Graduate Employ-
ees’ Organization’s COVID-19 
caucus, who told The Michigan 
Daily he felt no reassurance in 
returning to the classroom this 
semester.

“It more pissed (GEO) off 

because we know of students 
who are positive (for COVID-19) 
coming to our classrooms, sitting 
in class and then leaving,” Glaus-

er said. “We don’t know how 

(the University) is making (the) 
assessment (that classrooms are 
particularly safe), but we know 
it’s not based off of numbers 
because they can’t provide them 
to us when we asked them.”

In August, the University 

announced 
that 
they 
would 

require all students, faculty and 
staff to be vaccinated against 
COVID-19. 
U-M 
community 

members 
who 
were 
granted 

exemptions are required to get 
tested weekly. Currently, 96% 
of students and 88% of staff, 
including 96% of faculty, are 
fully vaccinated against COVID-
19. The University also requires 
everyone to wear masks in all 
on-campus buildings regardless 
of vaccination status.

At the start of the fall 2021 

semester, 
COVID-19 
cases 

increased dramatically, by over 
100 cases during the first three 
weeks of classes. By the end of 
September, the positivity rate on 
campus dropped to about 0.8% 
and has remained low.

Even with high vaccination 

rates among students and fac-
ulty, Rackham student Erick 
Aguinaldo, 
graduate 
student 

instructor in the Department 
of Women’s and Gender Stud-
ies, told The Daily on Sept. 30 he 
has yet to experience a full week 
without a potential COVID-19 
exposure since the beginning of 
the semester.

“I get overwhelmed by emails 

every 
week 
about 
students 

who’ve either tested positive for 
COVID, are showing symptoms 
or think they might have been 
exposed,” Aguinaldo said.

Aguinaldo said he found it 

impossible to properly social 
distance in the classroom, espe-
cially without personal protec-
tive equipment being supplied 
by the University. As a result, 
he decided to teach both of his 
Introduction to Women’s and 
Gender Studies sections out-
doors, weather permitting.

“I’ve been teaching outside 

because of fear of COVID, but 
to my knowledge, there are not 

continuously refilled masks in 
the classroom,” Aguinaldo said. 
“From my understanding, (the 
University’s) masks aren’t great, 
so I went out of pocket and 
bought all of my students KN95 
masks for their safety and my 
safety as well.”

Aguinaldo also said his stu-

dents’ 
mental 
and 
physical 

health remain the top priority in 
discussion sections, something 
that is reflected in how he han-
dles COVID-19 cases.

“I’ve been telling students 

(who tested positive for COVID) 
to stay at home and that we’ll 
work things out, which involves 
them doing the assignments 
from home,” Aguinaldo said. “I 
definitely encourage them to rest 
and focus on their well-being 
instead of tripping out about the 
class.”

The motivation for these pre-

cautions, Aguinaldo said, is his 
fear of contracting COVID-19 
and transmitting it to his ten-
month-old daughter, who is cur-
rently ineligible to be vaccinated.

“As (the delta variant) con-

tinued getting worse, I became 
more and more hesitant about 
being in person,” Aguinaldo 
said. “My daughter’s ten months 
old right now, so that was a big 
worry for me.”

Echoing 
Aguinaldo’s 
con-

cerns, 
Lydia 
Kelow-Bennett, 

professor of Afroamerican and 
African studies, said she also felt 
nervous returning to the class-
room in case of breakthrough 
infections that could put her two 
unvaccinated children at risk.

“With unvaccinated children 

at home, I have had to change the 
way we relate as a family which 
has been devastating,” Kelow-
Bennet said. “Distancing from 
my own children seems too much 
to ask for a job.”

For faculty members to teach 

remotely, they must submit a 
request through Work Connec-
tions, the University’s disability 
management program. Accord-
ing to University President Mark 
Schlissel in an email obtained 
by The Daily, 28 requests for 
remote teaching were submitted 
through Work Connections. Of 
those requests, 20 were denied 
and 4 were accepted.

The Faculty Senate met last 

week to discuss and ultimately 
approve five motions, including 
the University’s COVID-19 pro-
tocols and the lack of options for 
instructors requesting remote 
teaching. Prior to the meeting, 
Schlissel wrote in an email to 
the assembly defending the Uni-
versity’s widespread return to in 
person learning. Schlissel also 
said that instructor requests to 
teach remotely are carefully con-
sidered by medical personnel. 

Schlissel added that “ 
it is not 

in Work Connections’ scope to 
review requests related to the 
health status of an instructor’s 
family members or others with 
whom they reside.”

German professor Silke-Maria 

Weineck, who has been advocat-

ing for faculty with serious pre-
existing conditions to be given 
more consideration for remote 
teaching options, said Work Con-
nections often rejects remote 
teaching requests for faculty 
who may be immunocompro-
mised.

In an email to The Daily, Wei-

neck said this includes faculty 
who are currently in chemother-
apy or who have lost multiple 
organs.

“Faculty who need to teach 

remotely due to high vulner-
ability are directed to Work 
Connections; a unit that has 
overwhelmingly 
declined 
to 

validate these requests,” Wei-
neck said. “These colleagues’ 
own physicians, overwhelmingly 
UM physicians themselves, have 
endorsed these requests. … Case 
managers who are not equipped 
to evaluate patients are given 
the power to overrule experts in 
their field.”

For Political Science Profes-

sor Deborah Beim, who recently 
tested positive for COVID-19, 
the chair of the Political Sci-
ence Department helped piece 
together a plan for asynchronous 
instruction during her quaran-
tine period. Still, Beim said she 
wishes she had originally pre-
pared a plan in case of a positive 
test this semester.

“(My 
department 
chair) 

helped me put together a plan 
where I uploaded asynchronous 
lectures from last year, which 
allowed me to take a week of 
rest,” Beim said. “I wish, in ret-
rospect, that I had had a plan 
that I could just like immediately 
kick into action.”

After testing positive for a 

breakthrough case early on in 
the 
semester, 
Kelow-Bennett 

said she immediately canceled 
her classes but initially could not 
find anyone to take over instruc-
tion while she stayed home and 
recovered.

“My department just really 

struggled to figure out a way to 
cover my classes, which is par-
tially about everybody being 
incredibly 
stretched 
thin,” 

Kelow-Bennett said. “But it’s 
also about (departments) and 
the larger University not having 
plans in place for the fact that 
professors were going to get sick 
and be out for extended periods 
of time.”

Once Kelow-Bennett’s quaran-

tine period officially ended, she 
still felt the lingering symptoms 
of COVID-19, so much so that she 
was physically unable to hold a 
lecture without running out of 
breath. When Work Connections 
denied Kelow-Bennett’s request 
to continue teaching remotely, 
she said she felt helpless.

“I felt disposable when I read 

that email,” Kelow-Bennett said. 
“I realized that if all (the Uni-
versity) cares about is that I’m 
infectious, not the fact that I will 
pass out either walking to class 
or talking to students, then that 
means that there’s no value put 
on my well-being and my life.”

When GSIs want to opt for 

remote instruction, Glauser said 
they are not allowed to use Work 
Connections and must instead 
submit both an Americans with 
Disability Act work request and 
a Services for Students with Dis-
abilities request.

Hoping to teach remotely, 

Aguinaldo said he sought assis-
tance from his instructor, as 
well as the Women’s and Gender 
Studies Department, to switch to 
a fully virtual format for his dis-
cussion sections. 

Though the department pro-

vided Aguinaldo with a lecture 
hall for his discussion sections to 
be better able to social distance, 
he said they ultimately declined 
his original request to teach over 
Zoom.

“I 
met 
with 
the 
interim 

department chair, and they were 
willing to provide accommoda-
tions to make me feel safer, but 
there’s no way to completely 
teach online,” Aguinaldo said. 
“They essentially said, ‘if you 
refuse to teach in person, then 
we have to remove you from your 
position.’”

Individual departments at the 

University are subject to college 
guidelines concerning teaching 
format and online instruction 
requests.

After the meeting, Aguinaldo 

said he left feeling like his voice 
was not heard and his situation 
not considered.

“I made it pretty clear that 

I was angry with the way the 
conversation went and the way 
consequences 
were 
framed,” 

Aguinaldo said. “I felt like it kind 
of devalued the safety of my fam-
ily.”

According to Glauser, these 

feelings of frustration are the 
general sentiment felt among 
GSIs whose requests for accom-
modations have not been met.

“I know of at least ten people 

who have not been able to get 
accommodations,” Glauser said. 
“At this very moment, we’re still 
fighting to get them remote work 
or extra accommodations for in-
person work so that they’re safe.”

With the Faculty Senate’s 

recent passing of the motion 
advocating for the incorporation 
of faculty input into the Univer-
sity’s in-person teaching policy, 
Kelow-Bennett said she hopes 
University leadership will con-
sider faculty concerns and trust 
instructors 
to 
govern 
them-

selves.

“This moment is a critical 

moment for central adminis-
tration to rethink how they are 
using their power and to rethink 
what faculty governance really 
looks like,” Kelow-Bennett said. 
“What we need are the flexibil-
ity and the support to be able to 
make the decisions that we need 
to make in order for everyone to 
navigate this pandemic.”

“Keep reading a little longer, not totally against 

your will.”

So goes the Booker Prize-shortlisted “No One 

is Talking About This,” the debut novel from poet 
and memoirist Patricia Lockwood.

I’ll cut to the chase: It’s a strange book. The form 

is stuttering and disjointed. The jokes don’t always 
land. The prose isn’t exactly prose. The fiction isn’t 
exactly fiction. And still, the novel is a resounding 
success. Lockwood captures the moment, vocal-
izing the boredom and sensory overload of social 
media. It’s gonzo fiction — the strangeness of our 
cyborg present, of lives half-lived on a screen, is 
felt in the form and style of the novel. 

In “the portal” — a platform analogous to Twit-

ter — a single voice is forming. People are starting 
to sound too similar. They’re adopting a universal 
language, quoting each other until an original 
phrase is a delicacy, another snippet to co-opt. 
Lockwood’s unnamed protagonist finds fame and 
an online career after she posts, “Can a dog be 
twins?”

The format of her post is picked up by others, 

and countless variations spread through the por-
tal until the words no longer belong to her: “Your 
slice of life cut its cord and multiplied among the 
people, first nowhere and little and then every-
where and large. No one and everyone. Can a 
_____ be twins.”

Why do writers so often ignore the existence 

of cell phones in their novels? Why does every 
transcription of text messages into prose feel so 
awkward and out of touch? To quote Lockwood, 
most attempts to describe the internet in fiction 
have “the strong whiff of old white intellectuals 
being weird about the blues, with possible boner 
involvement.” 

It’s a marvel, then, that Lockwood’s depiction 

of our curt digital tone feels so natural and so 
uncomfortably accurate: “(The internet) had also 
once been the place where you sounded like your-
self. Gradually it had become the place where we 
sounded like each other, through some erosion of 
wind or water on a self not nearly as firm as stone.”

“The mind we were in was obsessive, per-

severant,” Lockwood writes of social media. A 
prominent presence on Twitter, we’d expect her 
to understand our current voice. But Lockwood’s 
portrayal of social media isn’t just well-tuned, it’s 
journalistic. The novel foregoes a stable plot for 
the first hundred or so pages, jumping from one 
topic to the next — an endless scroll of ellipted 
paragraphs, linked only by their shared presence 
on the page. 

The effect is instant and familiar: the breeze 

of half-watched TikToks, the grainy hike of a 
long Twitter thread. Fifty pages sneak by before 
you look up, before you remember the rest of the 
world. And then you do look up:

“Despite everything, the world had not ended 

yet. What was the reflex that made it catch itself? 
What was the balance it regained?”

At the midpoint, the novel turns into a more 

conventional story. The protagonist’s sister is 
pregnant, and her child is born with a rare genetic 
disorder. Her time is limited, and they know this. 
They’ll lose her, and they know this. 

The story to this point has been a stream of 

shared consciousness, of infinite bullet points 
from faceless usernames. Our main character was 
an information junkie with an endless supply, but 
her niece’s life cannot stretch so far: “All day long 
she drank in information, but no one was telling 
them the main thing. No one was telling them how 
long they would have her, how long the open cloud 
of her would last.”

This is the turn, “the portal, where the entirety 

of human experience seemed to be represented, 
and never the shining difference of that face, those 
eyes, that hair.” Here’s the real story, the love felt in 
human presence. What’s the value of limitless infor-
mation if it can be dismissed with a swipe of the 
thumb? This is where Lockwood achieves some-
thing more than an experiment of craft, where the 
oddity and success of the form rises above curiosity 
and poignance. This is worth talking about. 

“No One is Talking About This” will be labeled 

as cultural critique, but I don’t think there’s such a 
perverse intention to it. There’s only the honesty 
of autofiction, of the first primary source from our 
bleak and side-splitting bell jar. It just might win 
the Booker Prize. And it just might deserve to.

I have a confession to make: I’m not 

a fan of my birthday. Birthdays are just 
an excuse for the 20-plus members of 
my close-knit family to gather together. 
As grateful as I am, the annual party 
evokes memories of stares as I sit in the 
middle of the circle, everyone gaug-
ing how appropriate my reaction is to 
each gift — a nightmare scenario for 
someone who hates being the center of 
attention.

Despite my distaste for the annual 

June 22 occasion, there will always 
be at least one birthday I won’t forget. 
It was that glorious summer of 2006, 
when I received my first video game 
console. I stared, mouth agape, at the 
warped reflection of my small face in 
the screen of my brand new ice blue 
Nintendo DS Lite, not yet knowing how 
much it would affect my life.

Though memories of my childhood 

are dim, some of the brightest moments 
I can remember from that year revolve 
around “Pokémon Diamond.” Looking 
back, I’m sure my father was annoyed 
by my constant requests for help beat-
ing a game he had no clue how to play, 
especially while we made the long drive 
all the way from Michigan to Virginia. 
The remake of “Pokémon Diamond” 
releases in November, and I can’t 
help but recall the kindness my father 
showed instead of annoyance, and the 
genuine interest my grandfather had in 
the monsters that appeared from the 
virtual grass. 

Now that I’m a taxpaying adult, I 

wonder what lengths my mother must 
have gone to eventually get us a Wii a 
few years later, when we could barely 
afford three meals a day. I was nine 
years old, extremely shy and struggling 
to connect with my peers at school, but 
my evenings were spent as the star of 
the show, beating the high scores of 
each of my mother’s friends in “Just 
Dance.” My parents tell me that I was 
quite the little charmer, offering juice 
boxes to my father’s guests and stand-
ing on counters to change the song on 
my mother’s speaker as she cooked for 
everyone she knew. Of course, the cute-
ness never lasts, but even as I crawled 
into a shell of fear and awkwardness as 
I reached middle school, Nintendo was 
by my side.

Throughout my pre-teen years I was 

glued to my purple 3DS, playing the 
“Professor Layton” series “Pokémon 
X” and “Phoenix Wright: Ace Attor-
ney.” Ages 11 to 14 aren’t exactly the 
most pleasant times of anyone’s life, but 
those were the years I made my first 
true best friend, thanks to a mutual 
love of puzzle games. Sleepovers and 
recess were spent solving mysteries, 
debating which starter Pokémon to 
pick and discussing favorite characters. 

This friendship sparked a life-changing 
realization: I am never the only one like 
me. Sure, I wasn’t involved in sports or 
church activities like my classmates, 
but together my best friend and I could 
be an unstoppable team in our digital 
fantasy worlds. 

Then, one day, my 3DS was gone. 

Whether it was lost in one of my many 
moves or at an airport I can’t remem-
ber, its absence commenced a nearly 
decade-long split from gaming.

High school was extremely busy. 

Between three bands, choir, drama 
club, dual enrollment and attempting 
to have a social life, I regularly expe-
rienced burnout. I was also lured into 
a habit of constant social media use 
that had negative 
effects on both my 
mental health and 
time 
management 

skills. At the end of 
the day, I thought I 
didn’t have time for 
gaming 
anymore. 

I 
viewed 
video 

games as a part of 
my childhood that I 
had to sacrifice, and 
none of my friends 
were interested in 
games 
either, 
so 

I went with what 
was popular. The 
games I was able to 
play were games I had seen online that 
required little to no time commitment. 

Two years into college, I was in the 

best mental shape since childhood, 
falling in love and learning to finally 
take back my schedule. One of my boy-
friend’s biggest hobbies is gaming, and 
we played “Undertale” together on 
one of our first dates. He showed me 
a trailer for “Animal Crossing: New 
Horizons,” and I fell in love with how 
adorable it looked. Next thing I knew, 
I had the “Animal Crossing” special 
edition Switch with a copy of the game 
“The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the 
Wild” and something from a familiar 
franchise — “Pokémon: Sword.” I was 
thoroughly sucked back into the world 
of video games thanks to warm, nostal-
gic childhood memories. 

It wasn’t exactly a quick descent. I 

started with a few hours of “Animal 
Crossing,” which turned into mul-
tiple hours a day thanks to quarantine. 
“Breath of the Wild” didn’t click with 
me at first, but my boyfriend encour-
aged me to keep playing. Now it’s one 
of my favorite games of all time, and it 
opened my eyes to whole new genres. 
Of course, there was my first love, 
“Pokémon,” which I became instantly 
obsessed with and blasted through 
before other games even had a chance 
to enter my mind. As quarantine con-
tinued and the world became increas-
ingly virtual, I had the time and energy 
to delve deeper into gaming. 

I’ve branched out into nearly every 

genre and every console; I earned my 
first platinum trophies on my Play-
Station 5 and invested over 100 hours 
in games like “Persona 5 Royal” and 
“Breath of the Wild.” When I listen to 
my boyfriend talk about his childhood 
afternoons glued to his GameCube, 
I think back on my own new experi-
ences with video games and feel closer 
to him.

Over the past two years, I’ve learned 

something valuable about hobbies. No 
matter your level of interest, your expe-
rience or your amount of investment, 
life can sometimes get in the way of 
the things you love. I’ve encountered 
this with my other hobbies, too; revis-

ing poetry is an endless process, and 
embroidery takes a lot of patience. 
However, if you love something, it’s 
worth trying even when you think 
you’ve reached an insurmountable 
obstacle. Losing my 3DS was unfortu-
nate, but what kept me from gaming the 
most was myself.

I turned 21 in June, this time with-

out the fanfare — just my boyfriend and 
me watching a movie in our apartment. 
When it was time for gifts, there was 
a lot to be thankful for, but there was 
one present I’ll never forget. When I 
unwrapped a perfect little ice blue DS 
Lite, complete with some of my favorite 
games in-box, memories of the past 15 
years filled my mind. I held it, noticing 
how big my hands had gotten, how dif-
ferent the reflection of my face was in 
the screen, and I found myself tearing 
up. 

I can’t imagine a future now without 

gaming. It’s my biggest hobby and one 
of my favorite ways to connect with 
others. Four years ago, I never would 
have guessed that I’d be writing about 
games for The Michigan Daily. As 
graduation approaches and the only 
thing I’ve known for the past 16 years 
comes to a close, I can finally see links 
that have helped me along the way. I 
started my school career with video 
games being a big part of my life, and as 
I earn my degree and this chapter ends, 
I can happily say I never plan on letting 
them go again.

All you need is love, and maybe a dose of 

the Mersey Beatles, too. Live at The Ark, 
Liverpool’s Mersey Beatles, a Beatles tribute 
band, brought down the house with a two-
set performance of the Beatles’s number-
one hits. Referring to themselves as John, 
Paul, George and Ringo, the Mersey Beatles 
stayed true to their idols’ roots. The show was 
part of their 2021-2022 world tour, including 
appearances across the Midwest and South-
ern states. 

What sets the Mersey Beatles apart from 

other covers or tribute bands is their dedi-
cation to Beatles nostalgia. The concert was 
structured by era. First, the rock n’ roll hits 
of the ’50s were accompanied by buttoned 
suits and Beatle-bob haircuts. The second set 
opened with neon Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely 
Hearts Club costumes (shoulder tassels 
included), and the third paid tribute to John’s 

’70s hair, George’s striped pants and Ringo’s 
yellow ruffled blouse. Between meticulous 
outfit changes, the band switched from 
ensemble hits to more intimate, one-off solos, 
including a memorable sing-along to “Here 
Comes the Sun,” led by the Mersey Beatles’s 

George Harrison.

The Ark is perfect for a cozy concert expe-

rience. Seating 400 with benches and tables 
only a stone’s throw from the stage, Ann 
Arbor’s beloved music club offers an ideal 
concert experience: beer and popcorn, plush 

seating and no raging crowds. More than 
that, it’s one of those special spaces where 
old-time music fans and Ann Arbor’s younger 
crowd come together to share the live music 
experience. 

This writer may have been born after the 

original Beatlemania, but even I know that 
the Beatles shouldn’t be experienced sitting 
down. By the time the lights dimmed and the 
crowd quieted down, we were up and danc-
ing and twisting the night away.

Balancing beer in one hand, popcorn in the 

other, the Arts writers of The Daily danced 
through the first set. Nine 20-somethings in 
a sea of imposing Beatles veterans, we danced 
with the kind of wild abandon that only 
emerges from a mix of embarrassment and 
daring joy. Surveying an exuberant but still 
seated audience, Paul called out, “Where are 
our dancers?” Boldly we responded, “Over 
here!” Jiving on a 2-by-4 corner of precious 
real estate, tucked away — but not for long. 

“Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Stand-

ing There” played back-to-back on the close-

out of the first set. We went wild. Slinking 
across the room, never losing the beat, we 
migrated to John and Ringo’s half of the 
stage. One then two older couples stepped 
up to join in our revelry. They put our dance 
moves to shame while we furiously took 
notes. 

The night ended with a two-song encore, 

the entire audience finally on their feet. 
Euphoric from our blast to the past, the 
motley dancing crew traded the twist for 
college-style moshing — all to the finale of 
“Get Back.” In the ringing applause, we gave 
a salute to our fellow dancing partners. A 
single, bold attempt was made to entice the 
Mersey Beatles to sample the fine dining of 
Fleetwood Diner. Maybe next time, George. 

Make the Mersey Beatles your next live 

show — and if you go, don’t be afraid to get 
up and dance. While their tour will eventu-
ally take them back across the pond, here’s 
to hoping they “get back to where you once 
belonged” — on stage at The Ark in Ann 
Arbor, Michigan.

The first installment of the Halloweentown 

series premiered on Disney Channel on Oct. 
17, 1998. I still had a month left before leaving 
the comfort of my mother’s womb. On Oct. 12, 
2001, “Halloweentown II: Kalabar’s Revenge” 
premiered. At two-going-on-three, I had yet 
to enter my Disney phase, and I was honestly 
more preoccupied with my newfound sister-
hood thrust upon me six days prior. Fast for-
ward to 2004: On Oct. 8, “Halloweentown 
High” premieres, and Lucas Grabeel (“High 
School Musical”) is making a name for him-
self on the Disney circuit before his debut as 
the beloved Ryan Evans. Meanwhile, I started 
kindergarten.

Finally, “Return to Halloweentown” came, 

and the surprising recast of our beloved 
Marnie. While 7-year-old me might not have 

understood the Hollywood politics behind 
trading Kimberly J. Brown (“Bringing Down 
the House”) for Sara Paxton (“Aquamarine”), I 
was only happy to ignore the continuity issues 
and, to this day, choose to believe that Marnie 
dyed her hair and got some work done before 
she went to college. After all, don’t we all 
deserve a chance to reinvent ourselves in the 
final film of our franchise? 

What’s most surprising about “Hallow-

eentown,” outside of the skeleton casually 
driving a taxi, is how ingrained it is into my 
youth. Every year since my childhood infatu-
ation with Disney began (in 2006 with the 
introduction of the beloved “Hannah Mon-
tana”), I have watched the “Halloweentown” 
films with absolutely no hipster irony driving 
my inevitable enjoyment of a Hauntoberfest 
movie marathon.

It’s completely understandable why 

“Halloweentown” has remained a staple in 
the Disney Channel Original Movie Hal-

loween lineup. The franchise offers 5.5 
total hours of runtime, with each film last-
ing a little under 80 minutes, and a litany of 
Halloween-themed television events meant 
to entice kids into watching cable television 
instead of streaming the latest Hulu series. 
Consider, maybe, playing a “Halloween-
town” film four days out of the week, lead-
ing up to a marathon of a new Halloween 
episode of your favorite wacky sitcoms on 
Friday. Or what about on Halloween itself: 
All four movies playing in the background as 
you and your friends put the final touches on 
your group costume (all the BTS members, 
complete with wigs and the best K-Pop mer-
chandise). Clearly, “Halloweentown” and its 
sequels have and will continue to offer seri-
ous commercial value to Disney Channel, 
propping up its status as one of the premiere 
Halloween DCOMs. 

The film’s financial promise, though, 

is not the only reason we see it play every 

year come October; the nostalgia of “Hal-
loweentown” only serves to enhance its 
staying power. On a laptop’s screen, the 
film is grainy, and the vintage hues create 
a warmth that only the ’90s can invoke. As 
a kid, I was entranced by the idea of ogres 
and goblins and witches and warlocks and 
adventure, and now? I long for the years 
where my only worries were why I hadn’t 
encountered any ghosts floating outside of 
school, trying to get an important message 
to me. “Halloweentown” also riffs on the 
age-old belief that the barrier between the 
mortal and whatever lies beyond is weakest 
on Halloween. In the case of classic fami-
ly-friendly entertainment, this means All 
Hallows’ Eve is the one night a year when 
a portal between Halloweentown and the 
mortal world opens and the Cromwell-Piper 
children can see their witchy (in the most 
literal sense of the word) grandma (Debbie 
Reynolds, “Singin’ in the Rain”).

Once “Halloweentown” establishes Mar-

nie and her siblings as witches, the next three 
films take on the ever-interesting question of 
what happens when you give a 15-year-old girl 
magical powers. Will she tell the cute boy from 
school about her newfound identity in hopes 
that he’ll notice her? Or broach the centuries-
long rift between the mortal world and the 
human world by telling everyone to just be 
friends? Or will she be the key to unlocking 
a power that could destroy the world as we 
know it? The answer to all these scenarios, of 
course, is yes. “Halloweentown” showcases 
Marnie as the kind of well-wishing, earnest 
and just a little bit sassy main character that 
Disney favors in all its creative endeavors. As 
one of the quintessential Halloween films of 
our generation, the Halloweentown franchise 
offers the mid-October hug of fall nostalgia we 
all need when the weather starts turning, mid-
terms are looming and Halloween costume 
ideas are brewing.

In the Year of Our Lord 2014, I celebrated 

my golden birthday, turning 13 on March 13. 
And sure enough, the Pisces male, middle 
school version of myself was as emotionally 
charged, creatively centered and idiosyncrati-
cally idealistic as I am now. Yet, a corrosive 
force, turning what was supposed to be a gold-
plated pubescent period into a rusty era of 
remorse, stemmed from the staggering real-
ization I had that year as an increasing aware-
ness of my social identities became ironed into 
my subconscious. The mainstream media’s 
fervent fixation on Ferguson with the mur-
der of Mike Brown propelled this force into 
motion, prompting a prominent newfound 
perception of my own racialized identity as a 
Black male in (what I would soon learn to be) 
the settler-colonial police-state of America. 
But if this glass-shattering, innocence-appre-
hending awakening wasn’t enough to fuel the 
anxious adolescent fire inside of me, the sub-
sequent suspicion, scrutinization and specula-
tion of my sexuality in the seventh grade was. 
It was then that homophobia and anti-Black 
racism alchemized in antagonistic fashion, 
manifesting as a menacing mixture that med-
dled not only in my middle-school years but 
beyond.

The traumas troubling my life trickle down 

to the marginalization of these two identities, 
which are exacerbated by my working-class 
status and deepened by the damning forces 
of capital which control our culture. When 
I was 15, phrases like “faggot” and “queer” 
were hurled at me on the regular — all before 
I had figured out what my sexuality even was. 
Of course, this “figuring out” and my capac-
ity to inquire about my own queerness was 
complicated by my mutable relationship with 
religion, having grown up in a conservative 
Black Christian church. Reconciling my faith 
with my ever-changing sexuality has been, 
undeniably, the most challenging tribulation 
of my life. When your devotion to the divine 
is dampened by dominating ideologies of the 
time, how else do you ensure that your modes 
of metaphysical and spiritual sustainment 
aren’t stifled?

Perhaps it’s my predetermined Pisces char-

acteristics perpetuating my compulsivity. But 
in light of these painful predicaments, I’ve 
become fascinated with learning about dif-
ferent faiths and the rich complexities and 
insights that various worldly religions have to 
offer and seek to answer. If there is a silver lin-
ing to my suffering, then it’s to be found in the 
drive I’ve developed over time to discern the 
real from the fake, fact from fiction and truth 
from non-truth.

The interplay of sexuality and religion is 

severely complicated by notions of gender. In 
pre-patriarchal society, the divine was depict-
ed as feminine, with the female God being an 
ancillary function of the Paleolithic and Neo-
lithic era. In “The Great Cosmic Mother,” radi-
cal eco-feminist author Monica Sjöö describes 
ancient societies around the globe as advanced 
matrifocal cultures built on equality and kin-
ship as opposed to dominance. In this period 
of time — from the Dahomey and Ashanti 
peoples of West Afrika all the way to the indig-
enous Pueblo peoples of America — the pri-
macy of the mother was an essential element. 

By the Bronze Age, however, Sjöö asserts that 
the Great Mother was demoted in status as the 
“remains of a revolution shift from dominant 
female gods of Neolithic village to organizing 
and controlling male gods of the literate city.” 
Many of us are familiar with the famous Sume-
rian religious text, “The Epic of Gilgamesh” 
an epic that influenced religious myths and 
narratives within the Hebrew Bible. Sjöö dis-
tinguishes both this piece of Mesopotamian 
mythology and the Old Testament scriptures 
as a reactionary response to the Goddess-
centered religions preceding it. She claims that 
much like the patriarchy, the emerging male-
centered religions effectively “split material 
production from spiritual experience, science 
from magic, medicine from herbal knowledge 
and psychic/seasonal environment, sexual-
ity from the sacred, art from craft, astronomy 
from astrology, language from poetry — and 
to place the resultant ‘specialized,’ abstracted, 
and mechanistic knowledge in the hands of a 
privilege male elite organized into professions, 
hierarchies, and classes.” This split and sepa-
ration has been a sustaining characteristic in 
all major worldly religions, including but not 
limited to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic faiths, 
Hinduism and Buddhism. 

Obviously, one does not have to look very 

far or very meticulously to see this unfortu-
nate reality. The holy texts of today are tainted 
with a patriarchal positioning that has subju-
gated women around the world for thousands 
of years. And this construction of an oppres-
sive male-centered society has had damning 
effects for sexuality as well. Sjöö ascribes the 
Hebrew Bible’s heterosexism as “an attack on 
all shamanistic ecstatic religion, against the 
bisexual image, theory, and practice of the 
Great Goddess.” Her elucidation reminds us 
that holy texts don’t exist in vacuums, and are 
drastically informed and curated by the mate-
rial and historical conditions of the era. Yet, 
these are the same texts which play a profound 
role in the lives of many around the globe. 
How do we harmonize the holy aspects with 
the harmful? Is there still a Truth to be found 
in these faiths? Is there a Devil or divinity to be 
found within the details?

Attempts to answer these questions lie not 

only in the hands of hermeneutics (biblical 
interpretation) but in our conception of divine 
revelation. Biblical scripture, for instance, has 
the capacity to be interpreted from a literal, 
moral, allegorical and anagogical perspec-
tive. These differing angles of approach pro-
duce an infinity of interpretations, allowing 
us to arrive at an infinity of outcomes. This 
becomes even more complicated when we 
consider the dialectics of distanciation espe-
cially in relation to the written word. In this 
literary context, distanciation refers to the 
concept that the writer of any text is “blind” to 
not only the readers of their work but also the 
context that their work will be read in. They 
are “blind” in the sense that the separation of 
the writer and reader, as well as the reader and 
the world of the text, fundamentally blurs the 
writer’s intention and reader’s interpretation. 
This blindness allows for what French her-
meneutic philosopher Paul Ricœur — a key 
crafter of the distanciation concept — refers 
to as a “surplus of meaning” to be amassed. 
As you can imagine, this article alone would 
evoke an infinitude in understanding, com-
prehension and interpretation for anyone 
who stumbles across it. We can only imagine, 

then, the immensity as to which any one indi-
vidual relates to a religious text. In writing, we 
emulate the enigmatic enterprise of our own 
Creator to effectively communicate the com-
plexities of existence without exterminating 
the free will of creation. 

In this same vein, divine revelation (the 

reveal of a celestial Creator to creation) carries 
with it an abundance of perspectives as well, 
which can complicate our relation to religion 
even further. Notably, Swiss theologian Karl 
Barth’s notion of a conception of revelation in 
which he argues that while having the capac-
ity to express the revelation of the divine, 
human constructions, such as scripture and 
the written word, cannot be a divine revela-
tion in itself due to the fact they are mediated 
through fallible mortal concepts such as lan-
guage. Yet, nonetheless, Barth believed there 
is Truth to be found in what he labeled as the 
“Subject Reality of Revelation.’ Like him, I, 
too, believe wholeheartedly in the outstanding 
capacity of our Creator to use us as vessels of 
disclosure and divulgence. After all, through 
the arts and writing, especially, we often find 
ourselves able to communicate to and con-
struct knowledge within others that we might 
not even be privy to ourselves. As Black theolo-
gian James Cone clarifies in his seminal text, 
“Black Theology and Black Power,” “the Work 
of Spirit is not always a conscious activity on 
the part of the persons through whom God 
works.” In the Biblical scriptures there exists 
a labyrinthine nexus of Truth and knowledge 
to be ascertained above that which the origi-
nal writers even intended. Moreover, many 
of these Judeo-Christian-Islamic religious 
myths and narratives are what queer theolo-
gian Elizabeth Stuart refers to as “parodies” 
of “extended repetition with critical distance, 
improvising on a theme [with] non-identical 
repetition, freshly embodied on new context.” 
Much like Marxist theory espouses the notion 
of retaining the old within that which is new, 
we can still discover the liberatory essence of 
the Cosmic Mother and the matriarchal man-
tras of pre-patriarchal society in our current 
holy text.

Systematic theologian Patrick Cheng 

and feminist and queer theologian Marcella 
Althaus-Reid both do exactly this by putting 
forth theologies of liberation focused around 
this feat. In Cheng’s book “Radical Love” he 
advances a doctrine of queer theology stem-
ming from classical doctrines around (the 
Biblical) God. He claims that the doctrine of 
the Trinity, which posits God as the beget-
ter (The Father), the begotten (the Son) and 
the procession (of the Holy Spirit), which 
through radical love establishes a dissolution 
of self and other, of knowing and unknow-
ing and of flesh and spirit. This dissolving of 
dualisms gives rise to a God that “transcends 
gender,” encompassing supra masculinity 
and super femininity. In this vein, God is a 
relational God, not operating outside, but 
with/in us. Along these lines, Cheng char-
acterizes Jesus Christ as the embodiment of 
this radical love, exemplified through the 
crossing of the divine into the human realm 
and then back into the divine realm. Addi-
tionally, Cheng queers Christ in a multitude 
of ways. Beyond the androgynous imagery 
Christ is commonly depicted with, Cheng 
cites his transgression of societal norms, 
homosocial relationships with disciples (and 
loving relationship with Lazarus) and bio-

logical intersexuality (Mary’s immaculate 
conception being devoid of a Y chromosome 
makes Christ chromosomally female while 
phenotypically male) as evidence. He goes 
on to liken the scapegoating of Christ in the 
crucifixion with the scapegoating of queer 
people in society. 

Reid elaborates on this queer-coded Christ 

even further. To Althaus-Reid, queerness is 
not an “oddity” or even a sexual/gender iden-
tity, but instead a zone of possibility, poten-
tiality and the essence of a denied reality. In 
her seminal text, “Indecent Theology” she 
inserts the notion of a “Bi/Christ” which 
refers not to sexual relations but ways of relat-
ing and thinking beyond binary. Over time, 
my own bisexuality has granted me the for-
tune of experiencing the world outside of the 
gay-straight dichotomy, which has, in turn, 
prompted me to perceive of reality along non-
dualistic lines. Christ, while deliberately walk-
ing in community with proclaimed “sinners 
and prostitutes” did so with an unfettered 
fluidity eschewing false dichotomies. The Vir-
gin Mary also experiences an “indecenting” 
or “queering” under liberation theology. No 
longer a representation of repressive Marian-
ismo and anti-sexual celibacy rhetoric, Mary 
instead in Althaus-Reid’s eyes undergoes a 
divinization through “spiritual clitoridecto-
my” and becomes a bearer (through the bear-
ing of the Begotten son) of radical love. These 
interpretations, from a hermeneutic lens, as 
divinity scholar Hannah Hofheinz describes, 
are creative interpretations which “create 
new liberative possibili[ities] by embodying 
knowledge as praxis within communities of 
struggle.”

Furthermore, these queerings are impor-

tant because they allow us to deconstruct the 
compulsory heterosexuality that has been 
so vigorously confounded into our culture. 
Althaus-Reid describes “heterosexuality” as 
originating within a pathological patriarchy 
operating through coercion and violence. 
Sjöö describes rigid heterosexuality as a men-
tal and physical limitation, stating that “it is 
as if on all levels of our being we are split in 
half — locked into one half, and forbidden the 
other … split against ourselves and against the 
self in the other by this moralistic opposition 
of natural polarities in the very depths of our 
souls.” She claims that this causes war and 
alienation as cisheteropatriarchy on behalf 
of capital continues to construct barriers and 
boundaries. If we have any chance of moving 
forward in our liberation efforts, we need to 
be cognizant of these constructions and the 
ways in which organized, institutionalized 
religion in their capitalistic efforts attempt to 
exacerbate them. 

Today, radical interpretations of Biblical 

scriptures are becoming increasingly com-
mon as more and more people begin to recon-
cile religion with their sexuality.* “The Queer 
Bible Commentary,” for example, is an 800+ 
page work providing an interpretative queer 
lens of every book in the Bible, and is just one of 
the many works seeking to unravel and resolve 
what Cheng describes as the typical “texts of 
terror” which supposedly condemn queer 
peoples to an eschatological fate of fire and 
eternal damnation. Beyond Biblical scripture, 
we should be interested in locating the righ-
teousness in revelation of all worldly religions 
and holy texts. However, we should do so with 
a discernment between historic literalism 
and mythic-symbolic interpretation, which 
Sjöö points out is often difficult to distinguish. 
Nonetheless, what we derive from the divine 
texts of our time is mostly ours for the mak-
ing and taking. In the context of the Trinity, 
the queering Christ is a queering of God, as 
our Creator. If this is hard for you to re-imag-
ine, consider how much we’ve constructed a 
mainstream conception of God as male, het-
erosexual and historically white. Indeed, as 
Althaus-Reid states, “To say ‘God the Faggot’ 
is to claim not only a sexuality which has been 
marginalised and ridiculed, but a different 
epistemology and also a challenge to positively 
appropriate a word which has been used with 
contempt to humiliate people.” 

In the Year of Our Lord 2021, I still struggle 

to make this reclamation without reservation. 
Yet, in the midst of my misfortune, I remind 
myself that this struggle, much like the reli-
gious myths of the Cosmic Goddesses of 
Creation, is a collective, universal and transfor-
mative one. And along those same liberatory 
lines, I know now, seven years after my Golden 
birthday, that if all else fails, I can rely on what 
I learned in Sunday School seven years prior; 
the Golden rule — a principle permeating in 
nearly all worldly religions — reigns supreme: 
“For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in 
this; ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.’ 
– Galatians 5:14.”

According to the regularly updated Uni-

versity of Michigan COVID-19 Data, 96% of 
students and 88% of the employees at the Uni-
versity have been fully vaccinated, as of Oct. 12. 
These seem like pretty solid numbers, and they 
are, considering the University’s arguably inad-
equate COVID-19 health guidelines like the no 
mask mandate at football games and the deci-
sion to end COVID-19 classroom notifications. 
However, if we were to examine the vaccina-
tion rates across all of Washtenaw County, only 
65.3% of residents are fully vaccinated. At the 
state level, only 58.7% of the population is fully 
vaccinated. Across the country, as of now, only 
57% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated. 
For reference, that’s roughly 70 million people 
in the United States still unvaccinated, giving 
plenty of opportunity for the COVID-19 virus 
and its deadly variants to infect and transmit 
throughout the population. 

Non-vaccination seems like a very compla-

cent response to the adverse outcomes of the 
pandemic, but it’s not surprising or new that 
individuals are hesitant to receive the vaccine. 
While many shame this view as a politically 
charged, ill-informed opinion, vaccine hesitan-
cy is an understandable symptom of public dis-
trust in scientific institutions and government 
intensified by chronic inaccessibility to quality 
and transparent health care. 

As defined by the World Health Orga-

nization, vaccine hesitancy is the “delayed 
acceptance or refusal of the vaccine despite 
availability to service,” and this has been a 
recurring sentiment from the invention of 
the first smallpox vaccine to child immuni-
zation today. Amid the panic and anxiety of 
a pandemic, it is easy to overlook the strides 
public health has made in infectious disease 
control through vaccinations. Still, we must 
remember, it is because of vaccines that we 
have eradicated 14 diseases otherwise dan-
gerously prevalent in the United States, as 

identified by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention.

Though the Food and Drug Administration’s 

approval for booster shots and pediatric doses 
of the COVID-19 vaccine are underway, hesi-
tancy persists as a threat to immunization for 
extremely susceptible populations — from the 
5 to 11-year-old population who may receive the 
vaccine for the first time to high-risk individuals 
who may benefit from boosters. Vaccination is 
important, and in the age of the unpredictable 
coronavirus and rampant misinformation, it’s 
even more important to know why.

Successful vaccination campaigns have led 

to disease eradication because of something 
called herd immunity. Herd immunity is a 
theoretical threshold of fidelity wherein a per-
centage of the population becomes immune to 
disease, significantly reducing the chance of 
disease spread. This percentage ranges from 
70% to 90%, depending on the infectiousness 
of the disease. Herd immunity results in pro-
tection for the whole population, or “herd,” 
even for those who are not or cannot become 
immune, and it is achieved by either natural 
infection or vaccines. While natural infection 
will induce immunity once we actually get 
infected to the point of illness and complica-
tions, vaccines create preventative immunity 
without making us terribly sick. 

Vaccines work to stimulate the immune 

system by mimicking infection. They intro-
duce weakened or dead antigens — the things 
that cause disease — to the body to induce an 
immune response and produce antibodies. 
Antibodies are molecules that remember spe-
cific antigens and fight them, so we don’t get 
sick. In the case of COVID-19 vaccines, acti-
vation of this immune response relies on the 
injection of viral genetic material which serves 
as a blueprint for our cells to make harmless 
viral proteins. By safely exposing us to the very 
thing that causes disease in a harmless, yet nec-
essary dose, vaccines are essential in prevent-
ing us from severe disease and death.

E

ach day, as I walk into the 
Ross School of Business, 
I face a similar scene. 

Upperclassmen, running around in 
suits like chickens with their heads 
cut off, trying to locate any source of 
a potential career gain: peers, faculty, 
recruiters or a “professional” cup of 
Starbucks coffee. For juniors, there 
is no better time than the present to 
start recruiting. For sophomores, 
they’re watching the clock gradually 
tick down to their moment. 

As a second-year business student, 

I constantly feel pressure to figure 
out my future path. I feel as though 
I have big-picture ideas and options 
— business, law school, sports 
management — but no real concrete 
plan for how to attain them. Thus, I 
am embarrassed when I listen to my 
friends talk about their upcoming 
summer plans or the millionth career 
fair they attended. I’ve acquired an 
urgency to throw myself into career 
preparation.

Except, the truth is that I have 

no idea what I’m doing. I created 
a LinkedIn and am diligent about 
updating my resume, but I know 
that isn’t enough. I always apply for 
the mentorship programs within the 
clubs I am a part of, hoping (albeit 
idealistically) that I will be assigned 
the right person and network my way 
to success. But the more advice I seek, 
the more disappointed I become in 
learning that there is no one way to 
approach the recruiting cycle. Or, as 
my peers and mentors have said, “it 
just kinda happens.”

There are a few statistics that may 

motivate your recruiting process: 
since 2013, at least 60% of students in 
their graduating class have completed 
an internship during their time in 
college. Just over 70% of employers 
end up offering their interns full-time 
positions. Furthermore, students 
who completed an internship are 
15% less likely to be unemployed 
after graduation. Sounds pretty good, 
right?

Maybe not as much as we think. 

Eighty-three percent of students 
reported that “it’s difficult to tell 
which companies are actively hiring” 
and another 74% said “companies 
(they 
are) 
applying 
to 
seem 

unresponsive” to their applications. 
Moreover, 72% said that the “stress 
and uncertainty from COVID-19” 
has made their job search “even more 
difficult to navigate.”

While it’s true that these claims 

are just numbers, there is something 
to be said about the ambiguity 
of recruiting. The theory that 
one person’s process is different 
from another person’s makes the 
unknown feel somewhat ominous. 
Worse yet, there is no definitive 
way to shake that interpretation 
until you receive an offer. Thus, it is 
rather easy to become stressed about 
something that will eventually define 
the majority of your life — especially 
when it feels like everyone around 
you has their plans figured out. I’m 
waiting for the “aha” moment, the 
invisible lightbulb to pop up above 
my head to tell me what I’m doing and 
where I’m going after graduation. 
Except what no one tells me is that I 
have to generate the power to light it. 

In my case, I feel foolish that I 

haven’t narrowed my options. Part 
of me just wants to spin a wheel and 
let it decide my major, internship 
and career; it would be a lot less of 
a hassle. However, I know that if 
I am not careful and deliberate in 
my reasoning, I am less likely to 
be happy 15 years from now. For 
me, an internal conflict has arisen 
between immediate and long-term 
satisfaction. While I know the latter 
is infinitely more beneficial, it’s hard 
to ignore the former when you’re 
surrounded by the grind of internship 
recruitment every day. 

In 
an 
already 
competitive 

environment, 
amplified 
by 
the 

pandemic, I sense I am not the 
only one searching for answers. 
According to CNBC, the best 
practices to alleviate perpetual career 
uncertainty are to network, use social 
media to your advantage and learn 
new skills. Sadly, telling us what is 
often considered self-explanatory 
doesn’t really make us feel any better.

So, I’m working to embrace 

my situation. I’m normalizing not 
knowing exactly what I want down 
to every minute detail. I’m focusing 
on schoolwork, clubs and cherishing 
time with people I enjoy — also 
sometimes known as savoring the 
college experience. I am tired of 
everyone looking past the current 
moment and accelerating into the 
future. 

I am not pushing aside recruiting; 

it’s important to build the foundation 
for your career while pursuing a 
degree, and at some point, I am going 
to prepare myself in hopes of securing 
an internship. For now, though, I’m 
not going to force anything, and that’s 
okay. I shouldn’t have to.

W

ith more than 50% of 
all COVID-19 vaccines 
produced so far being 

purchased by a small group of high-
income countries (HICs), many of 
the world’s poorest countries with 
developing economies will have 
less than a fifth of their population 
vaccinated by the end of 2021. An 
International Chamber of Commerce 
study determined that the unequal 
distribution of COVID-19 vaccines 
will cost between $1.8 trillion and $3.8 
trillion globally, while vaccinating the 
most vulnerable fifth of the world’s 
population, covering health care 
workers and the elderly, would cost 
less than $40 billion.

Vaccinating everyone on earth 

would therefore cost less than $200 
billion. Further, over 50% of the cost 
of not vaccinating everyone would 
be paid for by HICs due to decreases 
in trade with developing economies. 
While bilateral agreements have 
resulted in HICs receiving the 
majority of COVID-19 vaccine doses, 
it is in the best economic interest of 
HICs to support COVID-19 vaccine 
distribution in developing nations.

High vaccination rates in only 

HICs will not engender a successful 
economic recovery, as HICs depend 
on developing countries for what 
economists call intermediate goods, 
goods that are used in the process 

of production, and as a market 
for exports and cheap imports. If 
developing countries face decreases 
in production and consumption due 
to COVID-19 illness and restrictions, 
HICs will also face negative economic 
effects. In a world of globalization 
and world trade, the vaccine must be 
distributed at an affordable price and 
in a way that maximizes global public 
health if developed countries expect 
to make a robust economic recovery.

Economists 
often 
use 
cost-

benefit analyses to determine the 
most efficient course of action. The 
predicted costs to HICs of unbalanced 
distribution are much higher than the 
costs of investing in equal vaccine 
distribution. Vaccinations benefit 
more than just the individual who is 
vaccinated because they lower the 
rate of transmission for others as well 
as protect the individual from the 
virus. This cost-benefit analysis of 
an investment in COVID-19 vaccine 
distribution emphasizes the benefits 
of supporting vaccine distribution in 
developing countries. 

It is reasonable to expect HICs 

to prioritize vaccinating their own 
citizens first. However, even if 
HICs receive the first doses, their 
investment in increasing vaccine 
production 
and 
distribution 
in 

developing countries still results in 
a positive outcome for developing 
nations because vaccines will be 
produced faster and can then be 
distributed faster and more fairly. 
HICs have made bilateral agreements 

with vaccine manufacturers that 
prioritizes 
wealthy 
nations 
in 

vaccine access, threatening global 
herd immunity and a return of 
international economic activity. 

To maximize total social benefit 

globally and minimize costs, HICs 
should make bilateral agreements 
that 
also 
benefit 
developing 

countries. 
For 
example, 
when 

investment accelerates the quantity 
and speed of production, this 
benefits both wealthy nations and 
other nations. Similarly, increased 
optionality can result from bilateral 
deals that identify backup options 
which also benefit the entire global 
population. 

HICs can also invest in efforts such 

as The COVID-19 Vaccine Global 
Access Facility, which works towards 
rapid, fair and equitable access to 
COVID-19 
vaccines 
worldwide. 

When HICs invest in COVAX they 
make an upfront payment to support 
vaccine production in return for 
enough vaccines for 10-50% of 
their population. The more HICs 
that participate, the less risky the 
investment is because the more likely 
COVAX is to succeed in producing 
enough vaccines. HICs can decrease 
their total costs and maximize the 
total social benefit by promoting 
the production and distribution 
of 
COVID-19 
vaccines 
through 

financially 
supporting 
COVAX’s 

efforts and by making bilateral deals 
that will ultimately benefit developed 
countries.

High income countries should invest in equal 

global COVID-19 vaccine distribution

O

ne of the most interesting 
classes that I’m taking this 
semester 
is 
Philosophy 

355, which covers the philosophy 
of contemporary moral problems. 
The topic of discussion for this 
past week’s class has been NYU 
philosophy professor Peter Singer’s 
piece “All Animals are Equal” — the 
thesis is self-explanatory. I think my 
love for animals is pretty average in 
that I will stop to ogle a corgi as it 
walks by, but I am not currently in the 
practice of chatting with squirrels in 
the park. In other words, I’d say that 
my sentiments towards animals are 
pretty representative of most people, 
but Singer’s paper still managed to 

change my outlook on the 
topic.

When considering why 

eating meat is accepted 
by the majority of society, 
there is one main reason 
that emerges: Non-human 
animals are not seen as very 
valuable to society. Though a 
bit harsh of a justification, it 
is a rational thought process 
— and one that I, too, shared. 
But the integral question 
that Singer prompts is: 
how do we define equality? 
For humans, if we defined 
equality 
by 
monetary 

value or intelligence, then 
it wouldn’t actually be equality. In 
order for us to all be completely 
equal, there can be no attributes that 
increase or decrease worth, since 

the second you add those attributes, 
we cease to be equal. 

If we strip equality of being defined 

by monetary value or intelligence, 

there is no distinguishing factor 
that earns humans the right to be 
equal. I’m not saying that we need 
to be advocating for animals’ voting 

rights, 
but 
Singer 
does 

make a compelling case for 
their right to the equality 
of consideration; i.e, at the 
very least, their suffering 
is something that deserves 
consideration. 

Having showcased the 

inherent flaws in the natural 
human 
attitude 
towards 

non-human animals, it is 
time to talk about animal 
testing. The fact that animal 
testing is not illegal yet is 
in itself quite shocking, 
but 
what’s 
even 
more 

surprising is the University 
of Michigan’s involvement. 

For some context, the University 
offers the Undergraduate Research 
Opportunity Program (UROP). One 
of the projects that this program 

conducted 
from 
2010-2014 
is 

titled “Modulation of Pulmonary 
Defenses 
in 
Pathobiology 
of 

Chronic Infections.” Essentially, 
the project entailed injecting mice 
with the bacteria cryptococcus to 
observe how the mice reacted and 
how the bacteria affected the body. 
The eventual goal of the research 
was 
to 
test 
the 
relationship 

between bacteria and antibiotics to 
ultimately find a healthy balance. 
It is important to note that the 
bacteria can be lethal and that in 
previous experiments, it caused 
half of the mice to die within 20 
days. Though many may find this 
research completely justified in 
the name of science, the death toll 
of these mice does prompt some 
worry when considering its broader 
implications. 

SO WE CAN STAY TOGETHER

earned a major penalty and 
Cates was thrown out of the 
game. 

Before 
the 
hit, 
Duluth 

dominated. That all came to a 
halt when Blankenburg fell to 
the ice, and Michigan would 
go on to win, 5-1. Unclipping 
his helmet and failing to stand 
up straight, the captain’s game 
seemed to be over. 

“Nick is a really strong 

kid,” senior forward Garrett 
Van Wyhe said. “After that 
hit it woke us up because we 
were flat footed in the first 10. 
Seeing his determination to 

get back out there really got us 
going.”

The Wolverines looked to 

capitalize on the power play 
and 
avenge 
Blankenburg’s 

strike. With an opportunity to 
change the trajectory of the 
game, Michigan needed to take 
full advantage. 

With 40 seconds left on the 

clock, freshman defenseman 
Luke Hughes found the puck 
wide left of the goal, tying 
the game 1-1. Michigan tied 
the game, but in that moment 
found a sense of resolve.

The hit turned the game 

around. 

“They took a major penalty 

which was a turning point in 
the game,” Michigan coach Mel 
Peason said. “We scored there. 
To get the first one was huge 
and then we took over the game 
in the second period.” 

The Wolverines went on 

to 
outshoot 
the 
Bulldogs 

30-11 in the second period. 
Michigan 
scored 
midway 

through the second period 
through sophomore forward 
Brendan 
Brisson. 
By 
then 

the Wolverines had the game 
firmly in their grasp as Van 
Wyhe and sophomore forward 
Matty Beniers each scored. 
Duluth, on the other hand, 

couldn’t take advantage of 
their own power plays, going 
0-for-4 as Michigan embraced 
a gritty mentality.

Should Blankenburg have 

reacted differently, that all 
could have ended differently. 
In a situation where most 
players would retaliate against 
the Bulldogs, Blankenburg’s 
experience showed. He got 
back on the ice and played his 
role.

“You get your emotions going 

in the games, but Blankenburg 
is as tough as they come,” 
Pearson said. “He wanted to go 
out and I wanted to make sure 
we sat him for a shift or two … 
he’s a competitor, a warrior and 
you want him on your team.”

The captain proved his grit 

on the night. Returning to the 
ice after the hit, Blankenburg 
led the charge and made clean 
passes tape to tape. He kept 
his composure in Michigan’s 
biggest game of the year. 

Michigan started the game 

slow, 
but 
Blankenburg’s 

response to the dangerous 
hit set an example that the 
Wolverines could look to the 
rest of the game. Michigan 
needed 
its 
leader 
in 
its 

biggest game this season, and 
Blankenburg delivered.

Eli Brooks and Zeb Jackson 

not practicing

While teammates stretched 

and 
shot 
around, 
fifth-year 

senior guard Eli Brooks and 
sophomore guard Zeb Jackson 
stood off to the side.

Brooks’ sported a walking 

boot on his left foot, with the 
injury announced as a mild 
sprain. When asked whether it 
would affect him longer term 
and possibly bleed into the start 
of the regular season, Brooks 
replied matter-of-factly:

“I’m not going to miss any 

games or anything.”

Jackson was out with an illness 

rather than an injury, a team 
spokesperson said on Friday. 
His symptoms were enough to 
prevent him from practicing, but 
not enough to keep him home 
and away from his teammates.

This resulted in senior guard 

Adrien Nunez lining up on 
defense with what appeared 
to be the first-teamers, while 
freshman guards Kobe Bufkin, 
Frankie 
Collins, 
and 
Isaiah 

Barnes stood on the offensive 
side of the ball.

Caleb Houstan is as advertised
On the topic of freshman, 

forward Caleb Houstan showed a 
glimpse of what he might bring to 
this Michigan team. 

In shootaround before the start 

of practice, Houstan drained shot 
after shot from mid-range and a 
significant portion from beyond 
the arc. In the team’s first drill, a 
passing exercise, Houstan looked 
smooth and natural. In the few 
times the Wolverines messed up 
and were forced to restart the 
drill, Houstan wasn’t anywhere 
near the ball.

Where he showed a flash of 

what made him 247Sport’s No. 
10 nationally ranked recruit was 
in a mobile catch and shoot drill. 
It called for players running 
from baseline to elbow and 
back again after each shot for 
a minute straight. Each time 
Caleb’s turn came, he drew the 
gaze of the media. Shot after shot 
fell through the hoop, making it 

seem like Houstan would have to 
try harder to miss a shot than he 
would to make one.

“He shoots the lights out,” 

Collins 
said 
at 
Michigan 

media day on Friday. “I mean I 
personally, when I walk around 
the gym and locker room, I call 
him Klay Thompson.”

Houstan 
showed 
reporters 

what Collins meant when he 
said that on Friday. Though, it 
is important to remember that 
Houstan was not being guarded 
during the drill, and once defense 
is factored in, his efficiency 
is guaranteed to drop. Still, 
Houstan displayed his natural 
talent, and it was something that 
you couldn’t help but recognize.

A new-look Terrance Williams 

II

When 
sophomore 
forward 

Terrance Williams II took the 
court, 
he 
looked 
noticeably 

slimmer. 
His 
6-foot-7 
frame 

presented itself as that of a 
more agile small forward than 
a bruiser who could throw 
themselves around down low.

The 
transformation 
was 

intentional on Williams’ part, 
and encompassed a large part of 
his offseason plan.

“Over the offseason, I ate. I 

changed my eating habits. That’s 
really what it was,” Williams 
said. “Constantly eating greens 
like vegetables, I didn’t eat a lot 
last year. … It’s all paying off now 
because I feel it. I feel better now 
and I’m gonna continue to do my 
diet. It’s working now, staying 
disciplined”

Paired 
with 
a 
workout 

regimen that aligned with his 
goals, Williams has shed 10 
pounds, dropping from 240 to 
230 entering the season.

But his transformation doesn’t 

appear to be limited only to his 
physical 
attributes. 
Williams’ 

jump shot looked a lot smoother 
than the one he touted last year, 
and he, too, shot at a very high 
clip during the catch-and-shoot 

drill. 

“Terrance, 
especially, 
I’ve 

seen his jump shot improve 
tremendously,” senior forward 
Brandon Johns Jr. said. “There’s 
a lot more consistency.”

If Williams can find that 

consistency in games, it will be a 
boon to this Michigan team, and 
It’s something that will be crucial 
for his ability to find minutes in 
the upcoming season.

Big men stretch the floor
At this point, it’s still all 

speculative. Without watching 
an intra-team scrimmage, drills 
that 
incorporated 
full-speed 

defenders or a game, it’s hard to 
make any definitive conclusions. 

That being said, freshman 

big man Moussa Diabate and 
sophomore 
big 
man 
Hunter 

Dickinson were sinking shots left 
and right.

Diabate, 
especially, 
looked 

talented. On the hoop where 
he spent the majority of open 
practice, it seemed he was 
running 
through 
shooting 

drills more than anyone else 
on the floor. He hit shots from 
the baseline, the elbow and 

deeper shots closer to the arc. 
In 
warmups, 
he 
practiced 

floaters from the free throw line, 
making a meaningful amount of 
them. At 6-foot-11, any kind of 
shooting presence that he brings 
could prove to be a problem for 
opposing defenses.

“It’s just unbelievable what he 

can do out there on the court,” 
Johns said. “It surprises me all 
the time.”

In another part of the court, 

Dickinson participated in the 
same drills. From the baseline, 
he was banking his shots off the 
backboard and in on most of the 
ones he took. He also made a high 
percentage from shots closer to 
the perimeter.

Dickinson has been looking to 

add a jump shot to his game to 
take it to the next level. The work 
he’s put in during the offseason 
was apparent on Friday, and 
truly becoming somewhat of a 
shooting threat will be necessary 
for his prospective NBA career. 

“I think just the three pointers 

are probably the biggest thing 
that (NBA) teams want to see out 
of me,” Dickinson said.

With the score tied at two apiece and the clock 

dwindling, the Michigan hockey team transitioned out 
of its defensive end with speed. As sophomore forward 
Thomas Bordeleau cradled the puck, Minnesota State 
defenseman Benton Maase tried to lift his stick, with 
both of them angling towards the boards.

Using his body to block the defense, Bordeleau 

gained one step, two step, then passed the puck into the 
wheelhouse of sophomore forward Brendan Brisson. 
With a snappy one-timer, Brisson turned a momentary 
lapse by Maase into the game-winning goal.

“(Bordeleau’s) a really smart, cerebral offensive 

player,” Michigan coach Mel Pearson said. “You could 
see that all the way and that’s a big time play … by both 
those guys.”

Minor mistakes like Maase’s would go unnoticed 

against most teams, but there was little breathing 
room between two of the nation’s top teams. In a clash 
of skilled teams, the Wolverines’ fate hinged on how 
they managed those opportunities — both their own 
and those of the Mavericks.

Michigan made mistakes early on in the form of 

unforced penalties, which negated many of its rushes. 
From a call on sophomore defenseman Owen Power 
for indirect contact to the head, to a tripping call on 
senior forward Jimmy Lambert, the Wolverines shot 
themselves in the foot when they mounted quality 
attacks.

Michigan handled these kills well by keeping its 

structure and cutting off passing lanes, but those 
shorthanded minutes also gave the Mavericks plenty 
of time with the puck. That limited the Wolverines’ 
scoring opportunities and it allowed Minnesota State 
to keep Michigan’s high-power offense far away from 
its goal.

The Mavericks also gleaned a goal off of a hooking 

penalty by senior forward Jimmy Lambert. Minnesota 

State defenseman Akito Hirose pinched along the 
boards to extend his team’s attack after a clear from 
senior defenseman Nick Blankenburg. Soon after, 
Hirose fired the puck on net and his rebound met the 
Mavericks’ forward Ryan Sandelin for a goal.

“It hit my skate and then he was able to get the shot 

off,” Blankenburg said. “So I think in general, we’ve just 
got to be harder on pucks and harder to play against up 
front, especially against teams who work so hard.”

That kind of play wouldn’t stand out much against 

weaker teams, but it gave Minnesota State time to 
regain its attack and get a lead heading into the second 
intermission. Michigan realized it couldn’t afford to 
make further mistakes, and it tightened up its game 
accordingly in the next period.

But the Wolverines’ performance didn’t just revolve 

around mitigating their own gaffes. In such a close 
contest, they also took plenty of shots off of mistakes 
by the Mavericks.

Small shifts in positioning led to big results for the 

Wolverines as open skaters generated offense. On 
Thomas Bordeleau’s game-tying goal four minutes into 
the third, he cycled the puck to freshman defenseman 
Jacob Truscott on the point and skated unnoticed 
to the left side of the Mavericks goaltender Dryden 
McKay, where he would tip the puck into the net for

Minnesota State’s defense played well in their own 

end, winning back the puck with ease for the better 
part of the game. However, positioning errors like the 
Bordeleau goal and poorly timed plays like the Maase 
stick lift gave Michigan a window to grab a close win.

That’s nothing new after the Wolverines’ win on 

Friday, but the pressure of a close score exacerbated 
every mistake. Whoever blinked first could dictate the 
game winner, and that energy radiated through every 
decision both teams made.

Michigan played a game in which tiny errors led to 

some of its biggest moments. If the Wolverines benefit 
off those tiny errors like they did Saturday, that bodes 
well for a team that just grabbed both the Ice Breaker 
trophy and national attention.

Four biggest takeaways from the Wolverines’ preseason open practice

MADELINE HINKLEY/Daily 

Senior defenseman Nick Blankenburg received a high hit in the first period that ignited a spirited Michigan.


Sports
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
8 — Wednesday, October 20, 2021

During one of Michigan’s 

September home games, J.J. 
McCarthy glanced towards the 
student section and saw a group 
of fans with “I heart JJ” painted 
across their chests. 

For McCarthy, that level of 

devotion is almost ordinary. A 
five-star freshman quarterback, 
McCarthy stayed committed to 
Michigan last fall even amidst 
the throes of the Wolverines’ 
2-4 season, while the program 
floundered 
and 
uncertainty 

swirled. McCarthy and Donovan 
Edwards, a five-star freshman 
running back, were heralded 
as the duo that would rescue 
the program from the depths 
of the abyss and bring it back to 
national relevance. 

All of that hype seemingly 

places McCarthy and Edwards 
in an odd in-between. Michigan, 
6-0 and ranked eighth in the 
country, is off to its best start 
since 2016. A year that began 
with minimal expectations has 
quickly stirred the imagination. 

So 
for 
McCarthy 
and 

Edwards, 
undoubtedly 
the 

pillars of the future, the present 
situation requires a whole lot of 
patience. 

“I know eventually my time 

will come,” Edwards said on 

Tuesday. “And then when my 
time comes, I just can’t look back 
at other things from the past. 
Just gotta stay in the present 
moment and stay focused.” 

McCarthy 
likened 
the 

situation to a story he heard 
from his pastor in chapel. The 
tale goes as follows: A kid brings 
a guitar pick to a 15,000-person 
concert for one of his favorite 
bands. Mid-concert, the band 
stops playing and asks the 
audience if anyone knows one of 
their songs. The band then picks 
the kid out of the crowd, inviting 
him onstage to play the song — a 
feat he can accomplish because 
he brought the guitar pick. 

“That analogy to me really 

stuck, 
because 
we’re 
doing 

everything here we possibly 
can do to get in the game, but 
we’re not expecting to get in the 
game,” McCarthy said. “We’re 
ready to go no matter what. 
We’ve got our guitar pick in our 
pocket and we’ll be ready to go 
when our number is called.” 

McCarthy and Edwards are 

taking the initiative to make 
their words stick. Two weeks 
ago, after Michigan returned 
to Ann Arbor following its 
thrashing 
of 
Wisconsin, 

McCarthy and Edwards, along 
with freshman receiver Andrel 
Anthony, went to the practice 
field to run routes and build 
chemistry. They did so again 

this past week, at 4:30 in the 
morning after getting back from 
Lincoln, Neb. 

“I even took a picture of 

it, it meant that much to me,” 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said on Oct. 4. “It’s that kind of 
group.” 

Added Edwards: “We just 

want to get better. Whenever 
our time comes, we want to be 
prepared for the opportunity 
and seize the moment.” 

That 
moment 
has 
come 

infrequently for the pair this 
season. McCarthy has seen more 
playing time as of late, emerging 
as a complement to junior 
quarterback Cade McNamara, 
entering the game as a run-
first option that gives opposing 
defenses a different look. 

“We’re 
blessed 
to 
have 

really talented players who 
can play at a high level,” 
quarterbacks 
coach 
Matt 

Weiss said on Oct. 6. “I think 
(in) a lot of places, J.J. would 
probably 
be 
the 
starting 

quarterback, but we have the 
luxury where we don’t have 
to throw him in the fire right 
away. And we are trying to 
play him whenever we get that 
opportunity so that he can 
develop. Obviously, we want 
our backup quarterback ready 
to play whenever he’s called 
upon. The best way to do that 
is to play him when we can.” 

The 
same 
applies 
to 

Edwards. 
He 
remains 
a 

distant third in the running 
back rotation, trailing the 
talented duo of sophomore 
Blake 
Corum 
and 
senior 

Hassan Haskins. And yet, the 
coaching staff has emphasized 
a need to make Edwards a 
more prominent part of the 
backfield mixture. 

And for two players who 

have been in the spotlight 
their entire careers, the new 
roles require an adjustment. 
As McCarthy put it, he’s “been 
kinda the guy” all his career, 
from peewee football through 
high school. 

Now, though, he’s shifted 

his mindset. He’s taken a 
reverence 
to 
McNamara, 

emulating both his preparation 
and leadership. Edwards is 
doing the same with Corum 
and Haskins — attempting to 
mirror Haskins’s physicality 
and Corum’s explosiveness. 

So for now, nothing more 

than 
complementary 
pieces, 

McCarthy and Edwards bide 
their time until they are the 
faces of the program. The future 
is just that, and they’re OK with 
it. 

“We’re 
chasing 
greatness, 

that’s 
what 
we’re 
doing,” 

McCarthy said. “We’ve been 
chasing that since we were 
youngins.”

What Jett Howard brings to his father’s team 

and Michigan’s 2022 recruiting class

It’s not every day that a player in a 6-foot-

7 frame can do all the things that Jett 
Howard can. He profiles as a knockdown 
shooter, a two-way player, a three-level 
scorer and a more than capable playmaker. 

The son of Michigan head coach Juwan 

Howard and 37th ranked player nationally 
in the class of 2022, according to 247sports, 
Jett committed to the Wolverines from IMG 
Academy on Instagram Live Wednesday 
afternoon. The four-star prospect has 
shown he not only possesses all the tools to 
play at the collegiate level, but to flourish.

“He’s an elite playmaker,” IMG Academy 

coach Sean McAloon said. “He can make 
plays off the dribble, and he’s also an elite 
shooter. I think the thing that people don’t 
notice enough about him is that I don’t 
think there’s anybody (at his position) that 
passes the ball better than he does. The 
things that he sees, the way in which he 
sees them and how he delivers on time, it’s 
a special quality.”

It’s because of these qualities that 

Michigan has reason to anticipate Jett’s 
arrival next season. A versatile wing player 
that can make the extra pass or knock 
down a jump shot could find a spot on any 
college team in America.

And when Jett steps foot in Ann 

Arbor, he figures to be in contention for 
a starting role. McAloon believes that 
he is well-suited to play the ‘2’ in college 
and immediately make a difference on the 
Wolverines’ perimeter.

But, in order to become someone who 

could lead a college-level offense, Jett will 
have to find a way to take his game to the 
next level.

“Vocally, he’s not ready to put the pieces 

where they need to be,” McAloon said. 
“But, I believe he has the ability inside to 
(initiate offense at a college level) as long 
he’s willing to vocally put the pieces on the 
map … I’m sure that would be the next step 
in his growth.”

If Jett finds a way to elevate himself to 

that next level that McAloon suggested, 
then there’s no telling how high his ceiling 
could be.

For now, Jett is ranked 37th nationally, 

but with his senior season at IMG Academy 
still to come, his ranking could very well 
rise over the course of next year. McAloon 
certainly thinks there are areas to his game 
that scouts are overlooking.

“I think people don’t give him the 

credit he deserves,” McAloon said. “I 
think people miss on him, and they think 
it’s like, well, you know, it was given to 
him.

“Nobody gave him the ability to shoot 

the way shoots, and nobody gave him the 
ability to pass the way he passes, or the 
instincts that he has. Those are things that 
are worked on. And I think a lot of times 
people just see what they want to see as 
opposed to the time that somebody puts in 
the gym.”

And if Jett has his way, he’ll soon be 

recognized for being more than just 
Juwan’s son.

After earning the first Sweet 

Sixteen appearance in school 
history last March, this Michigan 
women’s basketball team is far 
from done. They’re just getting 
started. 

But the expectations that 

come with finishing at No. 11 in 
the nation aren’t getting to the 
Wolverines’ heads. In Ann Arbor 
this Thursday, Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico made her 
approach to the upcoming season 
clear at Michigan’s media day:

“I think sometimes when 

you get caught up in what the 
expectations are, you forget the 
process,” Barnes Arico said. “We 
talk about that a lot as a program. 
Let’s just be the best Michigan 
team that we can be today.”

The culture of hard work that 

Barnes Arico has built at Michigan 
is paying off: her message has 
clearly resonated with the team. 
The effect of this humble and 
hungry philosophy was evident in 
her players’ attitudes.

“One of our things that we say 

here is that we’re the hardest-
working team in America,” said 
junior guard Maddie Nolan. “So 
we’re constantly trying to get 
extra shots up and get in extra 
workouts.”

Nolan averaged 4.5 points 

and 3.3 rebounds per game last 
season while shooting a team-
high 36.2% from behind the 
arc. She played 21.6 minutes per 
game last season, but could be 
seeing the floor more frequently 
this season after guard Akienreh 
Johnson’s graduation in the 
spring.

Forward Hailey Brown joined 

Johnson 
in 
graduating 
last 

season. Losing these two starters 
will hurt the Wolverines, but a 
strong senior class is stepping up 
to lead.

“One of the biggest things is 

leading by example,” said senior 
guard Danielle Rauch. “I’m a big 
proponent of that, because I don’t 
want to be someone that tells 
other people to do something 
that I wouldn’t do.”

Rauch 
wasn’t 
a 
major 

contributor last season, averaging 
16.2 minutes and 2.3 points per 
game. However, she did start five 
games, and this could indicate 
that she is headed for a bigger role 
on the court in her senior season 
in addition to her role as a leader 
in the locker room.

Rauch isn’t the only senior 

stepping up as leader. Senior 
forward Naz Hillmon is looking 
to build off of a successful junior 
campaign for both herself and 
the team.

“I 
want 
to 
do 
anything 

that I can to help my team be 
successful,” said Hillmon. “I 
know that if I’m putting 110% out 
there and doing my best, that’s 
the most you can ask for. But, I’m 
a competitor. I like to win.”

Hillmon was a tough problem 

for opposing teams last year, 
averaging 23.9 points and 11.4 
rebounds per game and earning 
Big Ten Player of the Year 
honors. Her dominance in the 
post was a constant, highlighted 
by a school-record 50-point 
and 16-rebound game against 
archrival Ohio State in Columbus 
last season.

Senior guards Leigha Brown 

and Amy Dilk join Hillmon as 
the returning starters from last 
year’s team. Brown averaged 
18.2 points per game last season 
while shooting an efficient 52.3% 
from the field. Meanwhile, Dilk 
led the team with 3.9 assists per 
game a year ago. This one-two 
punch of scoring and playmaking 
will continue to be a dynamic 
combination in the backcourt for 
Michigan.

After a successful campaign 

last season and with a lot of talent 
returning, the Wolverines appear 
poised to continue their presence 
in the national spotlight. But 
until that happens, it looks like 
Michigan will keep working 
hard and trusting the process.

“Everything that we had to 

go through and all of those little 
hurdles and obstacles that we 
had to overcome really brought 
us closer together,” said Barnes 
Arico. “And we were ready for 
the moment when the moment 
came.”
