Sources say biology
programs will get
a new home
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily Staff Reporter
Biologists, hold on to your lab
coats.
Plans for a brand new biology
building on Central Campus are
underway and will likely come
before the Board of Regents for
approval sometime this fall.
The project - first reported by
the Ann Arbor News - will pro-
vide a new facility for the Univer-
sity's programs in Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology and Molec-
ular, Cellular and Developmen-
tal Biology, sources close to the
planning process said. These pro-
grams are currently housed in in
the aging Kraus Natural Science
Building adjacent to the Diag and
Ruthven Museums Building on
North University Avenue, which
currently hosts the Natural His-
tory Museum.
Prof. Robert Denver, associate
chair of research and facilities for
the Department Molecular, Cel-
lular and Developmental Biology,
confirmed the project in an inter-
view on Thursday. He said the
University began seeking input
from faculty in town-hall-style
meetigs over the summer.

After an initial information-
gathering period, the University
has started meeting with archi-
tects to discuss more concrete
plans for the project.
Denver said the plan would
likely call for open-concept lab
spaces. Though open-bench lay-
outs are typically used for bio-
medical research labs, Denver
said the concept would likely
serve the diverse faculty of the
department well.
"The current building is a very
old building," Denver said. "We've
been in it for 98 years and haven't
really received any significant
renovations in that time. Things
are falling apart. It's very dif-
ficult to do modern, life-science
research in this building."
Former LSA Dean Terrence
McDonald, who first initiated dis-
cussion on a new biology facility
during his deanship, said the Uni-
versity has been considering the
project conceptually for the past
few years.
McDonald added that the proj-
ect was important because the
two biology departments train a
significant number of students in
LSA and the current facility was
hindering the recruitment of top-
tier faculty.
"They wanted a facility that
encouraged interdisciplinary
research, that was able to house
cutting-edge equipment and

The University has once
again placed in the Times
Higher Education World Uni-

versity Rankings, moving up
two spots from last year to
number 18 in the world.
The California Institute of
Technology was ranked as the
best institution for the second
year in a row, followed by a tie
at second place between Har-
vard University and University
of Oxford in the United King-
dom.
The University's overall
score was a 79.2 out of 100,
which is lower than past years
despite the higher ranking.

Within its ranking, the Uni-
versity scored highest in aca-
demic citations, which reflects

Next president
must be a strong
fundraiser

Upcoming leader to
inherit 'Victors for
Michigan' campaign
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily StaffReporter
As the Presidential Search
Advisory Committee continues
its hunt for the University's next
leader, one of their foremost con-
cerns will be finding an adminis-
trator capable of planning for and
meeting the future needs of the
institution. To do that, an expe-
rienced, proven fundraiser will
be critical.
With , state appropriations
declining by more than
26 percent over a 1oyear
period - dropping from
$416 million in 2002 to
$308 million in .2012
according to the Uni-
versity's 2012 financial
report - the Univer- Filling Fa
sity's Board of Regents
has said that any future president
will be expected to maintain and
build relationships with donors.
During the September 2013
University Board of Regents
meeting, Jerry May, the Uni-
versity's vice president of devel-

opment, reported that 129,000
donors had made gifts to the Uni-
versity during the 2013 financial
year. Gifts totaled $357 million
- a number that has, on average,
increased over recentyears.
Emphasizing the growing
importance of giving, May said
attracting donations remains an
important goal of the University.
"(Fundraising is) huge at a
school like Michigan, because a
school like Michigan has to both
be a public university in terms of
its philosophy and a private uni-
versity in terms of its fundrais-
ing," May said. -

Fmr. Ukranian president
speaks on country's future

Yushchenko says
Ukraine needs
stronger national
identity
By TYLER GRINN
For the Daily
Viktor Yushchenko, former
Ukrainian president who held
office from 2005 to 2010, spoke
Thursday in the Rackham
Amphitheatre about his vision
of the future of Ukraine.

Yushchenko spoke as a part
of the fifth-anniversary cel-
ebration of the Weiser Center
for Emerging Democracies.
Ronald and Eileen Weiser, who
founded the center with a $10
million donation in 2008, were
in attendance.
The title of Yushchenko's
speech was "Shades of Orange:
A Decade of Ukrainian Democ-
racy," a referenceto the Orange
Revolution that occurred after
the 2004 presidential cam-
paign and election.
"In my personal opinion,
our biggest problem and chal-

lenge is that we are not united,
we do not stand as one, we
are not integrated internally"
Yushchenko said through a
translator.
He added that Ukraine's
multiple languages, religious
variations and differing his-
tory textbooks contribute to
the country's fragmentation,
and that he's working to build
a more united Ukraine.
Yushchenko blames the
lack of nationalism on the
country's breakup into sec-
tions controlled by different

Stock market continues to fall
amidst government shutdown

Palestinian farmers take
back previously owned land

Investors fear neither
party closer to
reaching compromise
NEW YORK (AP) - Inves-
tors sold stocks across the board
Thursday as a U.S. government
shutdown dragged into its third
day and the nation inched closer
to a critical deadline to raise its
borrowing limit.
Stocks opened lower and fell
steadily throughout the morn-
ing.The Dow Jones industrial
average slumped nearly 200
points, but later pulled back
from its slide.
Investors fretted that Repub-
licans and Democrats were no
closer to ending the budget
impasse. In a speech, President
Barack Obama said there was
only one way out of the shut-
down: "Congress has to pass a
budget that funds our govern-
ment with no partisan strings
attached."

Investors also got some disap-
pointing economic news.
The Institute of Supply Man-
agement said that sales fell
sharply, new orders dipped and
hiring weakened at U.S. service
companies. The report covers
industries including retail, con-
struction, health care and finan-
cial services.
The stock market losses on
Thursday marked an accelera-
tion of gradual declines from
the last few weeks. Stocks have
fallen nine of the last 11 days as
investors grow nervous about
the political crisis in Washing-
ton and the hit to the economy if
it continues.
Republicans in the House of
Representatives, pushed by a
core of tea party conservatives,
are insisting that Obama accept
changes to the health care law
he pushed through three years
ago as part of a budget bill.
Obama refuses to consider any
deal linking the health care law
to routine legislation needed to


US ,

extend government funding.
The U.S. Treasury Depart-
ment said Thursday that the
economy could plunge into a
downturn even worse than the
Great Recession if Congress
failed to raise the debt ceiling
and the country defaulted on its
debt obligations.
The U.S. missing a debt pay-
ment could cause credit markets
to freeze, the value of the dol-
lar to plummet and U.S. interest
rates to skyrocket, according to
the Treasury report.
The head of the International
Monetary Fund called it "mis-
sion-critical" that the fight over
,the debt ceiling be resolved as
soon as possible. IMF Managing
Director Christine Lagarde said
if Congress fails to raise the debt
ceiling, the consequences could
be severe not just for the U.S. but
for the global economy as well.
A default "would be so cata-
strophic and such a self-inflicted
wound that you can't imagine
we would let it happen," said
Maury Fertig, chief investment
officer of Relative Value Part-
ners. "But the fact is that every
day we get closer to it the possi-
bility increases, even though it's
remote."
The Dow fell 136.66 points, or
0.9 percent, to close 14,996.48,
its biggest decline since Sept.
20. It was down as much as 186
earlier.
The Standard & Poor's 500
index dropped 15.21 points, or
0.9 percent, to 1,678.66. The Nas-
daq composite fell 40.68 points,
or 1.1 percent, to 3,774.34.
Stocks pulled back from their
some of their losses in after-
noon trading after the New
York Times reported that House
Speaker John Boehner told his
party that he wouldn't let the
nation default. The newspa-
per attributed the news to an
unnamed House Republican.
Lawmakers must periodically
raise the nation's borrowing
limit to keep U.S. funds flow-
ing, but the once-routine matter
has become a bargaining chip in
battles over the federal budget
deficit.


Lawyer says proof of
Palestinian ability
to reclaim land
BURKA, West Bank (AP) -
Palestinian farmers on Thursday
reclaimed lands they had lost
decades earlier to an Israeli set-
tlement, celebrating a rare legal
victory their lawyer said illus-
trates that Israel's settlement
enterprise is reversible.
In the 1970s, Israel had seized
several hundred acres from resi-
dents of the West Bank village of
Burka to build the Israeli settle-
ment of Homesh. The settlement,
along with three others in the
West Bank, was razed in 2005,
in connection with Israel's with-
drawal from the Gaza Strip at the
time.
However, Palestinians were
not allowed to return to their
lands after the 2005 demolition
of Homesh because the military
did not rescind the land seizure
order and prevented access to

the area, said attorney Michael
Sfard.
After more than two years
of court petitions, the military
agreed several months ago to
rescind the seizure order and last
week lifted access restrictions,
said Sfard of the Israeli rights
group Yesh Din.
The military confirmed it had
acted in line with the petitions.
On Thursday, farmers
returned to their land for the
first time. "I feel as if I was dead
and now I am alive again," said
Fathallah Hajjeh, 64. "I never
felt such joy. We are rooted to
this land."
About 500 acres of land were
reclaimed, said Emad Saif of the
Burka local council.
The return of the land shows
that "the settlement project is
reversible," said Sfard.
Since capturing the West
Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem
in1967, Israelbuiltand expanded
dozens of settlements that are
now home to more than-half a
million Israelis.


Palestinians hope to establish
a state in those territories, but
say settlement expansion makes
it increasingly difficult to draw
borders between Israel and a
future Palestine.
Israeli-Palestinian negotia-
tions on the terms of a Palestin-
ian state resumed in late July, but
gaps remain wide and expecta-
tions are low on both sides that
a deal can be reached.Experts
notethatNewYork'shigh annual
price tag is deceiving because it
reflects considerable pensions
and salary responsibilities, debt
service and the expensive fixed
costs. The DOC says 86 percent
of its operatingcosts go for staff
wages.
New York's system differs
from other cities in some other
costly ways - it employs 9,000
relatively well-paid, union-
ized correction officers, for
example, and is required by law
to provide certain services to
inmates, including high quality
medical care within 24 hours of
incarceration.

ated pressure on higher-educa-
tion administrators to improve
fundraising performance year-
over-year.
"The job of the president has
actually changed quite a bit over
time, and being a fundraiser
and soliciting donations is actu-
ally increasingly important to
a president," she said. "Argu-
ably because it is increasingly
important for their institutions
to have those revenue streams
coming in from private indi-
viduals."
Tom Baird, assistant vice
president of development
campaign strategy, said the
University usually runs one
comprehensive campaign per
decade under the guidance of
the president. University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman over-
saw the Michigan Difference
campaign that was launched
in 2004 and raised more than
$3.2 billion by the end of 2008.
The University will begin its
next cycle of major fundraising
on Nov. 8 with the "Victors for
Michigan" campaign - which
the upcoming president will
have to complete.
Baird said prior to a cam-
paign's launch, the president
works with other top adminis-
trators to name the goals that

Generally, Fitzgerald said
planners of potential proj-
ects first engage in thorough
research and secure appropri-
ate funding before presenting
proposals to the regents.
Additionally, planners must
carefully consider a new facil-
ity's location, specifically to
ensure it fits with the Univer-
sity's master plan for Central
Campus.
Denver declined to confirm
University sites in consider-
ation, Denver said an ideal
location would be in close prox-
imity to the Undergraduate Sci-
ence Building, which houses
many classes taught in the biol-
ogy department. He also said
neither the Kraus Building or
the Ruthven Exhibits Building
would be likely torn down.
He noted that the only fea-
sible spot nearby is the site of
North Hall, the current ROTC
building, which last month was
slated for demolition.
"That's right next to the
Undergraduate Science Build-
ing and there is no other place
right next to it," Denver said.
"Really, if I had my preference,
that's where it would go."
Several members of the Uni-
opment, found that rankings
"drive reputation, not the other
way around."
The researchers also found
that since many rankings rely
on their own students' reviews,
colleges have been manipulating
the surveys theygive to students
in order to improve their own
ratings.
Despite the flaws, the same
researchers found in a 2009
paper that changes in rankings
for schools in the top 25 of the
U.S. News and World Report
the fundraising will target. He
said "Victors for Michigan"
will focus on student support,
engaged learning and "bold
ideas for the public good."
"Whenever you begin a pro-
cess for planning for the next
campaign, the president then
works with the provost and the
deans and the faculty and the
vice president for development
in terms of figuring out what are
the campaign priorities," Baird
said.
Under Coleman's leadership,
donations to the University
have been steadily increasing.
The University found itself in
the spotlight as the recipient of
a $110-million gift from Charles
Munger in April and a $200-mil-
lion gift from Stephen M. Ross
in September.
Judith Malcolm, senior direc-
tor for executive communica-
tions, said Coleman and Ross
have a close partnership. Ross
will serve as chair of the upcom-
ing fundraising drive.
Regent Katherine White
(D), vice chair of the Board of
Regents and acting spokeswom-
an during the search process,
lauded Coleman's success and
focus on fundraising.
"President Coleman is an
absolutely phenomenal fund-
raiser. Her skills are extraor-
dinary and she has hired
outstanding people to assist her
in this endeavor," White wrote
in an e-mail interview. "The

As a fifth-year neuroscience
doctoral student, Rackham stu-
dent Joseph Knoedler has spent
a good portion of the last few
years inside Kraus, which was
built in 1914 by famed Detroit
architect Albert Kahn.
Inside a lounge at the end
of one of Kraus's dim halls,
Knoedler said the department's
current facility has plenty of
character, but probably needs
some upgrades.
"You need a better argument
than character to keep using a
building that's becoming rapid-
ly behind the times," Knoedler
said.
However, he noted new facil-
ities aren't the deciding factor
in producing scientific achieve-
ments.
"Good science is done here
just as it is in the slick medical
facilities," Knoedler said. "A
new building is probably going
to be more energy efficient and
up to code, but I think good sci-
ence is about the people in the
building and not about how
slick the facilities look."
survey do produce noticeable
effects in the application and
admission pool for a school.
"College rankings receive a
great deal of public attention,
and many institutions are quite
concerned about their position
in these rankings," Bastedo and
Bowman wrote. "Unfortunately,
the current study suggests that
institutions can effectively woo
more highly qualified students
by using status signals that are
unrelated to substantive chang-
es in institutional quality."
hope is that the next president
will be as effective in fundrais-
ing."
May added that part of Cole-
man's fundraising success can
be attributed to her ability to
build lasting relationships with
potential donors.
The foundations and goals
that Coleman has set will soon
be passed to the next president
to bring to fruition. University
Provost Martha Pollack said
the new president will likely
be responsible for raising two-
thirds of the new campaign
goals, after Coleman kick-starts
it this November.
Terrence McDonald, direc-
tor of the Bentley Historical
Library and former LSA dean,
said as the search for Coleman's
predecessor gets underway, a
background in effective fund-
raising will likely be at the fore-
front of criteria for the search
committee to consider.
However, McDonald added
that the University is at an
advantage in that it has many
donors who are loyal to the
institution itself, regardless of
who holds the presidency. He
said fosteringrelationships with
those donors, as Coleman has
done, will remain key to the suc-
cess of the future president.

and we already filled 95 percent
of our allotted capacity on the
first day," MacKie-Mason said.
He added the new space is
exciting, as is the location.
The School of Information is
in a period of expansion with
the upcoming addition of the
Bachelor of Science in Informa-
tion program and the relatively
new Master of Health Informat-
ics joint degree with the School
of Public Health. This expan-
sion has lead to the necessity for
new office space to accommodate
more faculty and staff, Heather
Newman, Information School
director of marketing and com-
munications, said.
The first floor of the building
is divided into five commercial
spaces, and PRIME Research,
a strategic communication
research firm, will share the sec-
ond-floor offices with the School.
Aside from being near cam-
pus and the Information School's
main office in North Quad, the
increased lunch options and
proximity to technological inno-
vation also attracted the Infor-
mation School to the Borders
property, Newman said.
As a plus for students and
faculty, the building is also very
close to the offices of several
major tech companies, includ-
ing Google, Menlo Innovations,
TechArb and Barracuda Net-
works.
The history of the program
was influential in the choice of
location because, at its inception,
the program was split between

of difficulties.
"The split between West Hall
and School of Information North
posed some difficulties for those
folk who were housed up there
just because the geographic
difference made it difficult for
people to coordinate, especially
at that point in time, on a daily
basis," Newman said.
The new offices will be quieter
and more open than the offices
in North Quad, which Newman
said will allow for increased col-
laboration.
The Liberty Street Office will
be connected to offices in North
Quad via a wireless network and
teleconferencing, and will pro-
vide extra space for employees
between offices.
"The bottom line is that our
office is pretty geeky already
just because of what we do, so
Google-chatting and Skyping is
stuff we all do on a daily basis as
part of our jobs," Newman said.
"So that kind of communication
is not going to change, and some
of the people who are making the
move are already in the habit of
instant messaging a colleague
who works six feet away from
them."
The staff is excited to move
because it's a sign of the progres-
sion and expansion of the Infor-
mation School, but because the
new offices will mostly hold staff,
the sound of students will surely
be missed, Glenda Bullock, the
Information School's marketing
communications specialist, said.
"I don't anticipate that we
will see a lot ofstudents there - I
would like to," Bullock said. "One
of the things I'll miss about being
in North Quad is the interaction
with the students and faculty,
but we're only two blocks away,
so I expect we'll be back pretty
often."

Suspect inWashington car chase
killed near Hart Senate Building

Officer wounded in
pursuit will make
full recovery
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
woman with a year-old child
led Secret Service and police on
a harrowing car chase from the
White House past the Capitol
Thursday, attempting to pen-
etrate the security barriers at
both national landmarks before
she was shot to death, police
said. The child survived.
"I'm pretty confident this
was not an accident," said Met-
ropolitan Police Chief Cathy
Lanier. Still, Capitol Police said
there appeared to be no terror-
ist link. Authorities would not
say whether the woman had
been armed.
Tourists, congressional
staff and even some senators
watched as a caravan of law
enforcement vehicles chased

a black Infiniti with Connecti-
cut license plates down Con-
stitution Avenue outside the
Capitol. House and Senate law-
makers, inside debating how to
end a government shutdown,
briefly shuttered their cham-
bers as Capitol Police shut down
the building.
The woman's car at one
point had been surrounded by
police cars and she managed
to escape, careening around a
traffic circle and past the north
side of the Capitol. Video shot
by a TV camerman showed
police pointing firearms at her
car before she rammed a Secret
Service vehicle and continued
driving. Lanier said police shot
and killed her a block northeast
of the historic building.
One Secret Service member
and a 23-year veteran of the
Capitol Police were injured.
Officials said they are in good
condition and expected to
recover.

"This appears to be an iso-
lated, singular matter, with, at
this point, no nexus to terror-
ism," said Capitol Police Chief
Kim Dine.
The pursuit began when the
car sped onto a driveway lead-
ing to the White House, over
a set of lowered barricades.
When the driver couldn't get
through a second barrier, she
spun the car in the opposite
direction, flipping a Secret Ser-
vice officer over the hood of the
car as she sped away, said B.J.
Campbell, a tourist from Port-
land, Ore.
Then the chase began.
"The car was trying to get
away. But it was going over the
median and over the curb," said
Matthew Coursen, who was
watching from a cab window
when the Infiniti sped by him.
"The car got boxed in and that's
when I saw an officer of some
kind draw his weapon and fire
shots into the car."

Nation's austerity
policies are blamed
for three years of
painful recession
LISBON, Portugal (AP) -
Portugal has passed the latest
test of its compliance with the
terms of its bailout and quali-
fied for around 5.5 billion euros
($7.5 billion) in further funding
from creditors, officials said
Thursday.
However, the creditors who
lent Portugal 78 billion euros
in 2011 refused the govern-
ment's request to ease next
year's deficit target to 4.5 per-
cent of gross domestic product,
Deputy Prime Minister Paulo
Portas said. The goal remains 4
percent.
The government wanted
softer terms on the deficit to
ease austerity measures which
are widely blamed for an
expected third straight year of
recession in 2013. The govern-
ment predicts that the jobless
rate, currently at 16.5 percent,
will reach 17.4 percent by the
end of this year and hit 17.7 per-
cent in 2014.
The economic downturn
has fueled fears that Portugal,
like Greece, may need a second
bailout and prolong the crisis
which the 17 countries sharing
the euro currency have battled
for three years. Portugal is sup-
posed to start borrowing on
financial markets again in the
middle of next year, but three

major international ratings
agencies still classify its credit
worthiness at junk status.
Inspectors from the so-
called troika of bailout credi-
tors - the country's fellow euro
members, the European Cen-
tral Bank and the International
Monetary Fund - concluded
after a two-week assessment
visit to Lisbon that the gov-
ernment is complying with the
demands of Portugal's financial
rescue agreement, the govern-
ment and the troika announced.
"The (bailout) program
remains broadly on track, with
the authorities determined
to achieve its objectives," the
troika said in a statement. "Pro-
vided the authorities persevere
with steadfast program imple-
mentation, euro area member
states have declared they stand
ready to support Portugal until
full market access is regained."
Portugal needed the bailout
in 2011 when it was engulfed
by the eurozone debt crisis
and came close to bankruptcy.
In return, Portugal promised
spending cuts and economic
reforms, and quarterly dis-
bursements are conditional on
its compliance.
The troika said the Portu-
guese economy is "showing
early signs of a recovery" and
issued revised forecasts for
growth. The economy is now
expected to contract by 1.8 per-
cent this year, instead of 2.3
percent. The forecast for 2014
is for growth of 0.8 percent, up
from an earlier forecast of 0.6
percent.

No city left behind
The state of Michigan needs to take the lead in repairing Detroit
In a press conference Friday, President Barack Obama announced a
$320-million aid package for the city of Detroit. The package is not
aimed at relieving Detroit's $18-billion debt and is by no means a bail-
out for the city. Instead, this allocation includes federal, state and private
aid that will go toward improving several aspects of the city's infrastruc-
ture. Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and the state of Michigan have done lit-
tle to help Detroit financially, a fact that needs needs to change if the city is
going to improve. Investing in the city is a logical policy that will not only
encourage Detroit's recovery, but also benefit Michigan as a whole.

harmless word.

ing my people,
"What should I {

so I realize that
in asking that,
I'm half-jokingly admitting to being
a bitch.
I bitch, therefore Iam.
I'm not trying to be self-depre-
cating, but rather I'm using "bitch"
in a way that isn't negative. I've
reclaimed it - along with plenty of
other women (I'm talkin' about you,
Meredith Brooks). What used to be
an insult has become somethingthat
a woman can now be proud of - a
label that signifies strength, outspo-
kenness and all those other "unlady-
like" qualities.
Of course, the reclamation of
"bitch" is nothing new, but it's still
in the process of being reappropri-
ated. It's because of this reason that
the 2008 Saturday Night Live sketch
where Amy Poehler and Tina Fey
declared, "Bitches get stuff done" is
still resonant and funny (it's funny
'cause it's true).
But at its core, "bitch" is a misogy-
nistic word, and the problem with
"bitch" doesn't only arise when
it's used disparagingly. "Bitch"
screamed into a cell phone, yelled out
a car window, delivered with a slap
across the face, scrawled ona scrap of
loose leaf and handed to a frenemy in
Mrs. Collins' third hour - these are
all moments when "bitch" is indis-
putably a not-nice word to use.
The more subtly problematic
usage of "bitch" arises when peo-
ple who aren't women - or per-
haps more specifically, not bitches
- say the word, especially if it's

not being used in a de
insulting manner.

Instead of paying for the city's debt, the fed-
eral aid will help fund city services that will
help Detroit's citizens. The aid distributes $25
million to Detroit's firefighters, $24 million to
repair the city's bus system and more than $90
million - from both public and private sources
- to demolish and refurbish abandoned build-
ings. This gesture demonstrates that Detroit
is not merely a bankruptcy project, but a city
where families and communities live and work
- and aid from the government can positively
impact lives. However, it does overlook the
city's school system. Detroit Public Schools is a
district that has been plagued with ineffective
teachers. A portion of the funding could go to
attracting better teachers to the district.
Snyder and the state of Michigan need to fol-
low Obama's lead and invest in the Motor City in
order to create jobs and make it a more attractive
city to live in. Once a city peopled by 1.5 million,
Detroit has seen its population decrease by more
than 50 percent in just 60 years, with only about
700,000 residents remaining. Detroit is Michi-

gan's responsibility and the state needs to take
the lead in constructing its recovery.
President Obama's aid package illustrates
that Detroit and its residents is important to our
nation. This view directly counters Congress'
sentiments about Detroit - for they seem to
feel no obligation to help a city whose popula-
tion serves no political benefit to them. In fact,
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introduced an
amendment earlier this summer that would pro-
hibit government bailouts of municipal cities like
Detroit. Bloomberg reported on Sen. Richard
Shelby's (R-Ala.) disapproval of a Detroit bailout:
"What's happening to Detroit is going to happen
to a lot of our cities," Shelby said. "They're losing
their tax base, have eroding schools. It's a tough
situation." Because Obama couldn't garner the
support of Congress in compiling federal aid,
he had to scramble to collect the several grants
and private aid sources to generate $320 million.
Hopefully this aid package serves as a stepping-
stone in the revival of what was once the nation's
industrial powerhouse.

To anyone who's ever grown up

When we were very young,
California summers
were my vision of infin-
ity. I remember
asking from
under the covers
one night at bed-
time how long
it would take to
count to infinity.
Dad said it was
impossible. No JULIA
one ever could. ZARINA
Not even if the
first person on
Earth started
counting and each subsequent per-
son picked up where it left off when
he died. I tried to imagine the con-
cept of everything there had ever
been to count. I pictured the hills
from the back deck. I pictured every
blade of yellowing grass. I pictured
the sepia sunlight that illuminates
every memory I have and is the only
real way I know to distinguish what
was reality from what was a dream.
That was truly the only uncountable
thing I knew. Sunlight. It was noth-
ing and it was everything.
Growing up, I thought people
existed with a singularity of pur-
pose. That the universe was wholly
utilitarian and the unending strug-
gle against entropy was largely
tipped in favor of order. Our physi-
cal lives are geometric construc-
tions set starkly against a wild and
organic backdrop, and I believed
that our internal lives could be con-
ducted in much the same way.
I guess at some point every per-
son realizes that a life drawn in neat
lines is untenable. Just as water and
wind erode buildings poured in
sturdy concrete, growing up erodes
the belief that we are predestined
towards order in who we are, what
we do, who we love. Maybe it's acute-
ly destructive, like an earthquake,
the sudden jolt of losing everything.
Maybe it's the steady drip, almost
imperceptible until the day you find
yourself drunk and untraceably lost
in the cab on the way home from
the bar, reflecting on the vast "why"
of disappointment under a staccato
ticking of passing streetlights. Night
day night day night.
We fail. We win when we
shouldn't. The universe is reckless

ByZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
If there's one player to thank
for Minnesota's improvement
from Big Ten doormat to poten-
tial spoiler team, it's senior
defensive tackle Ra'Shede Hage-
man. Hageman is gregarious and
witty and at 6-foot-6, 311 pounds,
no one
would mis- B
take Hage-
man for a
doormat.fE
He's the
heart of
Minnesota's
interior defense, and likely its
best player. In five games this
year, Hageman has 20 tack-
les (including a team-best 5.5
for loss), one sack and three
pass breakups. He also has two
blocked kicks.
CBS Sports listed Hageman
No. 2 on its "Freak List: The
20 craziest athletes in college
football," behind just Jadeveon
Clowney. The Michigan Daily sat
down with Hageman at Big Ten
Media Days.
The Michigan Daily: Minne-
sota has been one of the more
improved teams in the confer-
ence. How can you get the defen-
sive line to continue to gain
confidence?
Ra'Shede Hageman: We have
so many playmakers that have to
get comfortable to play on the big
stage. I feel like sometimes even
in practice, we're so competitive
we're damn near fist fighting
with each other because we want
to do good. So just the simple fact
that the D-line kind of gained
that comfort level to make plays.
TMD: What's the biggest
change you've seen from when
Minnesota coach Jerry Kill first

up winning the Jug, which I'm
confident we are, it means a lot,
being on TV, being on camera.
Come on. Girls are looking at
you. You know the deal.
TMD: When were you edu-
cated about the history of that
trophy?
RH: The funny part, when I
was a freshman and a sopho-
more, I really didn't - I wouldn't
say I really didn't care, but I
wasn't educated about the tro-
phy game. And just the fact that
I'm a senior, it just means the
most to be making a statement.
You know you've got the alumni
watching, and the fans watching,
it's definitely a big statement to
win trophy games. And winning
the Brown Jug - I've never seen
it before. I've never touched it.
And I don't want to go down as
somebody who didn't get to win
the Jug."
TMD: Do you know the story
now, about how it started?
RH: Yeah, Michigan left the
Jug at Minnesota, and they
wanted it back. But they had to
win it back. So if I get Jug, I'm
definitely going to drink out of it.
Why not? It's a jug. ButI definite-
ly know the history about that.
Makes me even more motivated
to win that.
TMD: Do you have to teach
the freshmen about that?
RH: Always, man. It's always
the freshmen. They're definitely
the knuckleheads of the family.
But educating them about the
trophy games, especially Michi-
gan, hopefully it'll motivate
them to win and play that much
better, because that's how much
it means to us.
TMD: What would you drink
out of it?
RH: Off the record? [laughs]
Water. Gatorade.

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Ra'Shede Hageman was listed No. 2 on CBS Sports' "Freak List: The 20 craziest athletes in college football," behind only South Carolina lineman Jadeveon Clowney.

arrived?
RH: Just everything. It comes
down to school, just the athleti-
cism, the recruits he's recruited.
Coach Kill came here and made
a statement. He has what I call
that tough love. And some people
didn't get with it, but the people
that wanted to win are going to
get with it. Because at the end of
the day, you can say this or say
that to make people better, but at
the end of the day the tough love
is always the backbone to a good
program. And coach Kill came
in and made that statement, and

I feel like we definitely have
improvement.
TMD: A lot of people consider
you the best defensive tackle in
the Big Ten. What do you think?
RH: I don't think I'm the best,
you could ask coaches. I'm my
worst critic. In order to be the
best you have to be hard on your-
self. That's how I feel. So either
I'm always bugging my coach,
coach Phelps, bugging coach
Kline, coach Clay - sometimes
I'm even bugging coach Kill
abouthow Ican bebetter. It's like
D-tackle is so hard to make plays.

It's really about staying in your
gap. But I want to make plays as
a D-tackle. It's so hard to make
sacks as a D-tackle. And the fact
that I had six last year, I'm trying
to beat that. I'm trying to be com-
petitive against myself and other
opponents. So I feel like the fact
that I did OK last year was OK,
but I'm definitely trying to stand
out. I feel like this year is going
to be scary. That's how I put it,
it's going to be scary this year,
because I'm so comfortable with
playing D-line, D-tackle, I'm just
ready to make plays and just kind

of do alot of damage.
TMD: Michigan has won the
past five games for the Little
Brown Jug. What would it mean
to end that streak?
RH: The fact that we play
Michigan at Michigan, win the
Brown Jug and have everyone at
Michigan silenced, that's price-
less, dog. I'm smiling and cheesi-
ng right now, but that's priceless.
That means a lot to me as a senior,
but you know any trophy game is
just goose bumps. But the hard
thing is is getting the whole
team motivated. But if we do end

4. Can Racine continue his

Sophomore goalie Steve
Racine enters this season as the
No. 1 netminder, but is he ready
for the long haul?
The first game is by no means
a make-or-break moment, but it
will be easy to see if everything
has fallen into place early on.
What should you look for early
on then?
"I don't want to see any bad
goals," Berenson said. "I want to
see him play the puck, minimize
rebounds and stop the shots he's
capable of stopping."
Racine has had a full sum-
mer to practice in his new role,
which should be important for
his confidence. If he can bail out
the defense, he'll not only give
himself more confidence, but it
should filter down to the defense.

5. Is the team chemistry
stronger?
Last Friday, the Wolverines
took the day off, for what is likely
a program first: to play paintball.
It has little to do with hockey, of
course, and more to do with team
bonding.
Bennett, DeBlois and Copp,
in an effort to avoid a repeat of
last year, have organized more
activities as a way to combat
last year's issue. Throughout
last season, team chemistry was
poor and contributed to the early
struggles, according to Berenson
and players.
"I think there's a better atti-
tude in that locker room," Beren-
son said. "I think they can't wait
to play, and they're more worried
about doing the right thing this
year."
Added Berenson: "Everyone
wants to be a little bit closer than
last year, and I think we've done

a good job of that so far."
Part of that is due to the differ-
ent leadership in place from last
year. Last year, Berenson select-
ed a fourth captain, former for-
ward Kevin Lynch, a few weeks
into the season, a rare event in
program history. This year's trio
of captains is more vocal and
already more involved in getting
the team together.
There's a different feel now.
Captains organized shootouts;
skaters ran into boards to dis-
tract their teammates during
interviews with reporters; and
everybody suffers through con-
ditioning workouts now.
But what will it take to show
the improvement?
"I'd like to see our team
establish some type of identity,"
Berenson said. "Our team was
not as ready to play and win (last
year) as it is this year.
"This team's got a lot more
humility right now. I think
they're going to play hard."

For first time in 15 years,
'M' wins in East Lansing

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Writer
EAST LANSING - Fifteen
years. It had been 15 years since
the Michigan women's soccer
team won in East Lansing, since
it sung "The Victors" on the Spar-
tans' field.
That changed Thursday after-
noon as the Wolverines snapped
the streak, winning 2-1.
After not scoring in its last
two games, Michigan got on the
boardinthe MICHIGAN 2
10thminute MICH.STATE 1
with a goal
by junior midfielder Christina
Murillo.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan
has talked for most of the season
about starting fast, and the Wol-
verines did just that.
"When you're not hitting the
net, and you go through another
half where you don't score a goal,
you're like, 'Oh, not again,"' Ryan
said. "Again, it's two players who
scored besides (senior forward)
Nkem (Ezurike), and that's huge,
because Nkem's going to get on
track, but our main theme has
been the rest of you have got to be
determined to score goals."
The 21st-ranked Wolverines
(2-1-1 Big Ten, 8-2-1 overall) came
in needing a win after a 0-1-1
weekend. Michigan came out fir-
ing early on, putting its first shot
on goal in the fifth minute before
getting on the board.
Murillo lofted a high free kick
into the box, and Michigan State
goalie Courtney Clem backed
into the net and watched it sail
over her head for the Wolverines'
third-earliest goal of the season.
"I was just glad that finally,
after a lot of time, Iwas the person
to score," Murillo said. "I wish I
could say that it was intended as
a shot, but honestly I was just try-
ing to chip it to somebody. The
wind carried it."
Five minutes later, Murillo
passed another free kick into the
box, and senior defender Holly
Hein deflected it off a defend-
er. Senior midfielder Meghan
Toohey then grabbed the redirect
and hammered it inside the right
post. In 15 minutes, the Wolver-
ines had scored more than they

did all of last weekend.
"In our last few games, we
haven't really gotten a lot of scor-
ing opportunities," Murillo said.
"Coming into this game, we want-
ed to get as many chances, and I
think you see that in the stats."
Michigan came out in an
attack-minded 4-3-3 formation,
as opposed to its usual 4-1-4-L
"We had a couple more players
up there supporting Nkem, which
I think is always helpful for her,"
Hein said. "She's awesome on
her own, and she must have spun
30 players on her own today. We
were just able to get alot of move-
ment off the ball."
The Spartans (1-3-0, 7-3-2)
cut the deficit to one in the 74th
minute. Forward Alyson Krause
served a long free kick into the
box to defender Mary-Kathryn
Fiebernitz, who ran onto the ball
and headed it inside the far post.
Ryan was pleased with the
overall defensive effort, but he
was not happy Michigan let Mich-.
igan State back into the game.
"For us to give up that set-
piece goal and bring them back
to within one goal on a day like
today where we dominated this
game, there were some mental
mistakes by our players," Ryan
said. "This is a team that wants
to do big things. You can't make

those kinds of mistakes and do
big things. It's going to beat you.
Maybe it didn't beat you today,
but it's going to beat you.... That's
unacceptable."
The Spartans never truly
threatened to tie it up. The suc-
cessful set piece was the only shot
on goal they managed despite
nine shots.
"We were beating them con-
stantly," Murillo said. "But we
just lose our focus on certain
plays, and I think as the season
goes on we're going to see less of
those errors."
The Wolverines couldn't score
on any of their 31 of their shots
against Wisconsin and Minneso-
ta but improved Thursday. They
missed on a couple other oppor-
tunities in the second half. Fresh-
man forward Madisson Lewis and
senior midfielder Tori McCombs
each mishandled crosses into the
box that could have put the game
out of reach.
Ryan said his team will con-
tinue to work on finishing
opportunities as it heads into
two showdowns against ranked
teams. The Wolverines play at No.
23 Nebraska on Sunday.
"We've got to keep working on
our finishing," Ryan said. "Those
scrappy goals will winyougames,
and we've got to keep scrapping."

By JEFF GARLAND
Daily Sports Writer
EAST LANSING - In two
key conference home games
over the weekend, the No. 21
Michigan women's soccer team
failed to score a goal. But just 14
minutes into Thursday's match-
up against Michigan State, the
Wolverines had already found
the back of the net twice en
route to a 2-1 victory.
"I was really proud of how
we came out, and how hard we
played right from the begin-
ning," said Michigan coach
Greg Ryan. "Hopefully this
gives our players more confi-
dence."
The issue entering Thurs-
day's game wasn't getting shots
off, it was capitalizing on the
opportunities and finishing
around the net.
In games against Wiscon-
sin and Minnesota earlier in
the season, Michigan (2-1-1 Big
Ten, 8-2-1 overall) had a total
of 31 shots, eight of which were
on goal. Despite the impressive
totals, the Wolverines squan-
dered every chance.

This trend had to change,
and it did Thursday.
Michigan needed a spark
and found it in the form of good
fortune. Just nine minutes into
play at DeMartin Stadium,
junior Christina Murillo put the
ball just over the outstretched
arm of the Spartan goalkeeper
and into the net from 25 yards
out.
"I wish I could say it was
intended as a shot, but honestly
I was trying to chip it to some-
body, and I think the wind car-
ried it and it went in," Murillo
said.
Five minutes later, senior
captain Meghan Toohey got in
front of a rebound off a blocked
shot and blasted the ball by
Michigan State's bewildered
goalkeeper for the team's sec-
ond goal.
There was never a doubt
about Toohey's intentions.
"Yesterday our team went
over focusing on staying over
(the ball) and shooting when
you get the opportunity," she
said. "So I just shot it, and it
went in."
For Ryan, the team's offen-

Faced with its first road test
of the season
last weekend,
the Michi- Indiana at

team fell flat

Penn State TV/Radio:
brought the ESPN
Wolverines'
overall record
to 10-3 and put them in an 0-2
hole in Big Ten play.
"It's certainly not what we
wanted," said Michigan coach
Mark Rosen. "We wanted to
go in and try to get two wins. I
think we got caught up in who
we were playing and the step
up to Big Ten level of play. We
seemed a little shocked, and we
were playing on our heels. That
makes it challenging to play our
kind of game."
After beginning the season in
the top 10, Michigan has quick-
ly found itself on the outside
looking in. With a Big Ten title
and postseason aspirations on
their agenda, the Wolverines -
who fell four spots to No. 14 in
this week's polls - will look to
rebound quickly at home this
weekend as they host North-
western (1-1 Big Ten, 9-5 over-
all) Friday and Illinois (1-1, 5-7)
Saturday.
Having won nine straight
home games dating back to Oct.
20, Rosen believes that if any
team can bounce back at home,
it's his.

sive turnaround began in prac-
tice.
"We played five-on-five in a
tight area between two goals,
and it was all about 'don't wait,
just take it, take it,' and then
everybody else look for the
loose ball," he said.
The drill paid off as Toohey's
goal was the result of heads-up
play in a tight area.
Michigan took 20 total shots,
putting five on goal and two in
the net. By comparison, Michi-
gan State took just nine shots,
scoring on its only one on goal.
Despite the noticeable offen-
sive improvement from the
weekend, the team is still not
where it wants to be.
"We got to keep working
on our finishing," Ryan said.
"That's for sure."
The Wolverines missed
plenty of open shots, and per-
haps the story would be differ-
ent if the team hadn't caught a
break for its first goal. Nonethe-
less, Michigan did enough on
offense to secure a win Thurs-
day, but going forward it'll need
to do more to compete against
the best.

success andfailure, sowe always
have to be ready."
In Rosen's 15 years coaching
for Michigan, the Big Ten has
never been as competitive as
it is right now. Featuring eight
teams in the Top 25 and six in
the top 15, it is by far the nation's
toughest conference. With so
much talent on the court in each
game, Rosen knows it's easy for
his team to get caught up look-
ing across the net and become
overwhelmed. For this reason,
Rosen has preached simplicity
and self-control from day one.
"We can't make individual
games bigger than what they
are," Rosen said. "We need to
focus on playing Northwestern
and leave the other stuff along
the road out. We can't worry
about who's on the other side of
the net; we just need to focus on
ourselves and what we can do.
We only need to worry about our
execution and playing our game.
If we do that, I think with our
talent, we'll be in good shape."

"(After the losses) they
weren't happy at all," Rosen
said. "They're a very competi-

pride in their play, so they were
very frustrated losing two in a
row like that. But so far they've
responded very well to the
adversity, which is something
you look for in any team that has
goals like ours."
The response can be seen in
practice, where Rosen put the
focus on the defensive side of
the ball this week. Big Ten play
means bigger teams and bigger
serves, making blocking and
ball control all the more crucial
to success. After a rough open-
ing weekend in the conference,
Rosen wants to be sure his team
is more than ready for a second
round.
"We can do all the work we
want," Rosen said. "But in the
end we have to put it towards

Artists to 'Turn Up
the Beet' at the Ark

Farm taps roots
of the Ann Arbor
community
By CAROLYN DARR
For theDaily
On Oct. 6, Ann Arbor's clas-
sic venue, the Ark, will host
"Peas Turn Up the Beet," an
event that will raise money for
the Community Farm of Ann
Arbor.
A community farmer for four
seasons, Kat Oshman gave the
Daily the sweet scoop on this
delicious event.
"Paul Bantle and Anne Elder,,
who are head farmers at the
Community Farm, had the idea
that we could have a benefit
concert for the farm to try to
sell shares to members," Osh-
man said. "The last couple years
we've had a bit of trouble selling
shares, so we have had some big
fundraisers. In the past, they've
been a bit piecemeal because
we really need to raise money
and not spend any. This year,
we decided we were going to
go all out because not only do
we want to raise a lot of money,
but we also want to make this a
big community event. We did a
Kickstarter and raised almost
$10,000 to put on this concert."
The Community Farm is the
oldest CSA in Michigan and
the eighth oldest in the coun-
try. CSA stands for Community
Supported Agriculture and rep-
resents a movement to support
local farms and bring the com-
munity together to share fresh
produce. Ann Arbor's Commu-
nity Farm grows produce for
180 Ann Arbor families who are
responsible for picking up their
individual shares. Often, how-
ever, they are drawn into the
magic of the farm and end up
becoming participants in this

tasty movement.
"We are very unique," Osh-
man said. "Members take own-
ership in the farm and make
decisions together. We really
emphasize community and
bringing people together."
The farm, she explained,
does not use pesticides or fer-
tilizers and also makes its own
compost.
"Our mission is, first of all,
to help the earth by using prac-
tices that are sustainable and
respectful to the environment
and other creatures that are
living there," Oshman said.
"We don't think of this as just
food production. We think of
the farm as-a piece of land that
we are here to take care of in
every sense of the word, not just
something we can get what we
need from."
Attendees will have a chance
to sample some of that lush,
sustainably grown produce for
themselves.
"We're going to have free food
samples available in a showcase
called Taste of the Farm," Osh-
man said. "We are preparing
snacks for people to have before
the show and during intermis-
sion, all with things we grow
on the farm. It will be a little
mini feast for people, a really
nice way for them to experience
what it literally tastes like to eat
things from the farm." E
The two bands playing at the
event, Seth & May and Breathe
Owl Breathe, have close con-
nections with the farm and its
organic mission.
"Both bands have played fun-
draisers for us before," Oshman
said. "We feel their message is
in line with things we do at the
farm in terms of things they
try to urge their audience to
be mindful of. Their music can
be a real call to action to make
people aware of the environ-
mental issues and inspire them

to take action and make some
sort of change. These two bands
are really at the heart of Michi-
gan folk music. A concert with
them on the bill is a really spe-
cial event."
This appetizing concert will
bring in people from all over
Southeast Michigan, includ-
ing Detroit. The farm got indi-
viduals and organizations like
Whole Foods and Plum Mar-
ket to sponsor concert tickets
to make the event available to
those who could not otherwise
attend.
"We decided to sponsor
young farmers in the Detroit
community to make the show
accessible' to them," Oshman
said. "There's a huge move-
ment going on there right now.
There's urban farming, res-
taurants popping up all over
the place, local education with
school gardens and so on, but
these people really can't come
to Ann Arbor. We wanted to
make a connection between the
two communities."
The Community Farm hopes
that the event will not only help
it raise the money it needs, but
will bring everyone in the com-
munity together.
"This is an expression of,
what the farm has been doing
throughout its existence," Osh-
man said. "We want to bring
people together to celebrate
this vibrant community that
we have, the local food that we
have and all the good work peo-
ple are doing these days. Come
out to the farm, walk on the
land and really experience what
it's like to be there. People come
and say,'Wow it just feels good
here,' and you can see the trans-
formation happen in the person.
I think this concert is an oppor-
tunity for people to come and
really see for themselves what
it's like to be part of something
like this."

A better love story than "Twilight."

larly sensitive
about spoiling AMC
with this show,
so this is your very fair, explicit
spoiler warning.
"All bad things must come
to an end," declared the AMC
promos for "Breaking Bad" 's
"Felina." And for the first time
in a while, we got a series finale
that really did feel like the end.
After two weeks of episodes
packed with tension and horror,
"Felina" plays out much more
quietly, replacing the break-
neck speed and instability that
defines the whole series with an
almost dreamlike fluidity.
In the opening scene, Wal-
ter White (Bryan Cranston)
- stuck in a stolen car covered
in snow as red-and-blues swirl
around him in blind pursuit -
calls, earnestly and for the first
time, upon a higher power to
take him home. Keys magically
fall into his lap, and everything
that follows in the extended
episode has a fantastical, unreal
haze covering it that so starkly
contrasts the slashing realness
of all that precedes it.
Walt haunts scenes perfect-
ly framed by Vince Gilligan's
directorial hand. Todd (Jesse
Plemons) and Lydia (Laura Fra-
ser) don't notice him sitting just
feet away in their usual meet-
ing place, After Marie (Betsy
Brandt) calls Skyler (Anna
Gunn) to warn her Walt's back
in town and probably coming
for her, the camera shifts to
reveal he's already there, hover-
ing. In a perfect example of how
"Bad" uses sound mixing and
other techniques to set tone,
evoke emotion and even provide
narrative to an extent no other
show has accomplished, Walt
'lurks in the shadows of Elliot
and Gretchen's (Adam God-
ley and Jessica Hecht) home,
the silence and shadows more
threatening than Elliot's tiny
knife could ever confront.
It's a marked change of pace
from the rest of the whiplash-
inducing final season, and the
mostly unsettling series reach-
es a surprisingly settled conclu-
sion.
"Felina" 's standout moment
comes not from its most violent
outbursts, but from a quiet con-
fession from Walt to Skyler. "I
did it for me," he cuts her off as
she tells him to stop giving her
bullshit about doing it for the
family. "I was good at it. And I
was really ... I was alive." Most
of us knew Walt's motivations
were never about others (except
for the contingency of the few-
but-loud Team Walt soldiers
insisting he was a Family Man
who lost his way, a victim of
uncontrollable circumstances -
they're, hopefully, eating their
words and then some). But to

By REBECCA GODWIN
Daily Arts Writer
While on vacation with my
family this summer, we happened
upon a local theater production
and, being the theater fanatic that
I am, I convinced my parents to
see the show. Thus began both my
worst and best night ever at the
theater.
The show, titled "The Lost Col-
ony," has been running for years,
and details, through creative
license, the very unclear fate of the
Roanoke settlers, performed in an
outdoor amphitheater. Reviews
online were favorable and locals
said the show was worth the price
of the tickets.
Withinotwo minutes of the start
of the production though, those
hopes were all but shattered. As
dozens of settlers walked onto
the stage, singing what I can only
describe as a Gregorian chant
interspersed nicely with moments
of high-pitched shrieking, I knew
this was going to be a rough night.
After the settlers finally
stopped moaning, a narrator
(picture a televangelist wearing
a judge's robe) entered and began
to summarize ... something. I say

a recipe for a secondhand piece

Sadly, most of its tracks aren't
worth any detailing, aside from
the lead single, "Take Back the

bination of Michael Jackson's

single "Wanna Be Startin' Some-
thin' " from his Thriller days.
Though debuting in the Top 40,
the single performed poorly in
contrast to his last few releases.

the night, but he should consider
taking back the album instead.

Breakdown: a test
for rush defense

Jug history at forefront
in the Big Ten opener

By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
This is not the Minnesota foot-
ball team that Michigan has beaten
by a combined 80 points the past
two seasons. In that same span, the
Golden Gophers have won just four
Big Ten games.
In the 100th edition of this series,
Jerry Kill's Minnesota team will be
hungry to give its seniors at least
one win over the Wolverines for
their college careers. Here's where
each team will have an edge on Sat-
urday at the Big House.
Michigan pass offense vs.
Minnesota pass defense
Nowhere have the Wolverines,
struggles been more evident in the
two nail-bitingvictories over Akron
and Connecticut than in the play of
redshirt junior quarterback Devin
Gardner. Long stretches of incom-
pletions and mystifying decisions
by Gardner have cost Michigan
deeply in the past two weeks.
Minnesota's defense presents
some ball hawkers - five different
players have intercepted passes this
season. Gardner has repeatedly said
he is excited to get back on the field
Saturday after turning the ball over
seven times in the lasttwo games.
Gardner made his first-ever start
as a Michigan quarterback against
the Golden Gophers last season. He
threw for 234 yards, going 12-for-
18, with three touchdowns, two
through the air.
The tone will be set early. As
Gardner goes, so likely will Michi-
gan (4-0). If he struggles, it'll once
again be closer than necessary.
Edge: Minnesota
Michigan rush offense vs.
Minnesota rush defense
The Wolverines will display a
new offensive line, with redshirt
sophomore Chris Bryant joining it at
guard and redshirt junior Graham
Glasgow sliding over from guard
to center. Space for redshirt senior
running back Fitzgerald Toussaint
to run through hasn't come easily
in four games. Whether or not the
new-look line will have more than
a negligible impact remains to be
seen.

Fifth-year senior running back Fitzgerald Toussaint will likely share more carries.

In the Michigan backfield, Tous-
saint should have company Sat-
urday. Freshmen running backs
Derrick Green and De'Veon Smith
were given an increased workload
during the bye week, and the coach-
ing staff hasn't kept secret its inten-
tions to give them more carries
going forward.

ranked 18th in the nation in rushing

an ankle injury but will likely get

practice, the seniors always
emphasize that the Michigan
football team needs to play like
something is on the line - like
a trophy or a Big Ten champion-

there's a more
short-term reward at stake.
Minnesota is not much of a
Michigan rival, and the all-time
series isn't very close - the Wol-
verines have a lopsided 72-24-
3 record against the Golden
Gophers. Despitopll that, there's
still a reason the Minnesota game
is always circled on the Wolver-
ines' calendar. There's the Little
Brown Jug to protect, after all.
Last Sunday marked the offi-
cial end of the bye and the start
of Minnesota week. Michigan
coach Brady Hoke started the
team meeting with an explana-
tion of the Jug: its origins, its
history, its significance, going
back to its first appearance in the
1903 game. Twenty-six members
of the 114-man roster come from
outside Big Ten country, and
Hoke wanted to make sure each
one of them was as Jug-literate
as their teammates who came to
Michigan already familiar with
the matchup.
Longtime equipment manager
Jon Falk, the man responsible for
keeping the Jug safe, also con-
tributed to the players' education
- he opened Tuesday's practice
with a speech on the trophy's
value.
The Wolverines have won the
last five matchups with the Gold-
en Gophers, and that's one thing
about the Jug that Hoke tried to
emphasize above all else: "You'
don't want them to come over to

your sideline and take it back."
Not a practice, meeting or
moment went by this week when
the Jug wasn't-brought up. There
are reminders on the walls. The
message is impossible to ignore.
"I do believe that those games
that you have the privilege -to
play in (are important) because
of the history and tradition that's
been there," Hoke said.
But for as much as Michigan
talks about tradition and pride,
there's still a much more press-
ing matter at hand. The jury is
still out on which team - the one
that beat Notre Dame or the one
that barely squeaked by Akron
and Connecticut - will show up
Saturday.
Redshirt junior Devin 'Gard-
ner made his quarterback debut
against Minnesota' last season.
Even though he notched his first
interception, he still threw for an
impressive 234 yards.
Gardner's decision-making
abilities have since been at the
forefront of discussion over
the past few weeks, despite a
plethora of other issues plagu-
ing the Wolverines. Hoke already
shuffled up the interior line and
expects to see a well-rounded
Minnesota squad in Michigan
Stadium.
"They're going to be a physi-
cal football team because that's
the way (Minnesota coach Jerry
Kill) wants his teams on both
sides of the ball," Hoke said.
"From a defensive perspective,
I think they're pretty doggone
salty. Offensively, they want to
run the football."
Hoke handily beat the Golden
Gophers, 58-0, in 2011 - both
his and Kill's inaugural season
as head of their respective pro-
grams. Even though the margin
of victory narrowed to 35-13
in 2012, no current Wolverine
knows what it's like to lose the
Jug.
Minnesota may not be Michi-
gan's marquee matchup of the
season, but Gallon still had dif-
ficulty putting what the game
means into words.
"Celebrating with your team-
mates, playing for something
other than yourself ... it means a
lot to me and my team," Gallon
said. "Just knowing that the Jug,
that trophy, is comingback home
to you."

TABLE OF CONTENTS
What do we know about Michigan
through four games? Not much for

Inkster High School. Now, the school sits
vacant, its doors super-glued shut.
For the 100th game against Minnesota, the
Little Brown Jug has been a constant pres-

on as another opportunity to get
some help and pride in this build-
ing. It was just tough for me to
leave Inkster."
" nJanuary 2011, the new
administration wasn't as familiar
with Gardner's situation as the
previous one - Inkster had never
had an athlete do this before. For
a week, Gardner and his mother
thought that he wasn't going to be
able to enroll early, and since he
had already played in the Under
Armour High School All-America
Game, he wasn't eligible for bas-
ketball or track. His coursework
was done. It would have been a
wasted five months.
A solution was floated: Trans-
fer to Pioneer High School in Ann
Arbor. He would graduate there
early and be on track to practice in
the spring.
Gardner shot it down immedi-
ately. Absolutely not - Michigan
would have to wait.
If he was going to get a high-
school diploma, it was goingto say
Inkster on iC.
It didn't end up being a problem
when the school board stepped in.
to rectify the situation. The issue
worked itself out, and Gardner
became the first Inkster athlete to
graduate a semester early to play
college spring ball.
To the public, it looked like
there were issues with Gardner's
grades. In reality, it was just akid
who didn't want to abandon Ink-
ster.

Carter is working on a new
mural on the walls of his office at
Oak Park. He's starting his third
season there, but time will bring
pictures of his former players
turned college students to put on
the walls.
Right now, he has schedules
and posters from college coaches
who have stopped by to talk to
him hung up on the wall. Places
like Michigan, Notre Dame, Ohio
State and Cincinnati. In the mid-
dle of the posters is a newspaper
clipping from Gardner's first start
as a college quarterback against
Minnesota almost a year ago.
In lieu of a college wall, Gard-
ner is what Carter can show off as
proof that the system of education
over football is working.
Gardner doesn't have a place to
go back and reminisce anymore.
He's got an empty parking lot and
an overgrown school garden that
looks post-apocalyptic.
He does have Oak Park, though.
Carter has made it a point that any
of his former players can come
work out at the facilities or just
come to talk, like they would if
Inkster was still running. After
last season. Gardner brought his
highlight tape and teammate
James Ross III over to show Cart-
er and his staff.
Carter called him the Pied
Piper, so many kids were follow-

inghim around the hallways.
Still, Gardner and Gordon's
introductions on the Big House
video board each game refer to a
school that no longer exists. That
won't change no matter how wel-
coming Oak Park is.
"I'll never forget Inkster," Cart-
er said. "I miss it, I really do, even
after I left. That's probably one
of the toughest things I've ever
had to do, was to choose to leave
that school and those kids. We
still carry that stuff with us. We'll
never forget what was accom-
plished there and how we kind
of got that school to rise up. It's
a great little city, and they need
their own school if they want it.
"Kind of breaks my heart the
school is closed. Whether I was
there or not, that school was there
before I got there, and it should be
there after."
There isa massive purple rock
in the courtyard at Inkster. ef you
stand on top, you can just peek
over the buildings and see the
football field. Prom this far away,
it looks like a high-school football
field should.
Hearby, the paint on the press
box that says "Home of the
Vikings" is slowly fading away.
The door's super glue is still
strong.
The hand prints are now the
only thing left of the boys who
can't be the hero or the villain or
both because they didn't have the
chance to grow into either.

ment to Michigan even after
Tate Forcier had a dominant
freshman season and later,
when Denard Robinson became
a national name.
Gardner thought about
transferring after former
Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez was fired, especially after
new coach Brady Hoke arrived
and brought in a new pro-style
offense that would seemingly
take away the dual-threat part
of the dual-threat quarterback.
When Rodriguez was hired
by Arizona the following sea-
son, Gardner had conversa-
tions with Carter about leaving
Michigan to follow the man
who originally recruited him.
That inner faith kicked in,
though. If any dual-threat quar-
terback could make a pro-style
offense work, it was Gardner. So
he stayed.
He's a hyper athlete capable
of doing almost anything he
wants on the field, but he knows
that. He's Michigan's best offen-
sive player, but he also leads the
nation in turnovers. He has the
ability to change the game in a
snap, but sometimes that's for
the worse and not for the better.
From Carter to Hoke to for-
mer high-school teammates -
they all say he just needs more
time and experience to figure
out the turnover issue.
Still, at what point do Steu-
benville and Notre Dame stop
melding into what Gardner still
is today? At what point does he
forget how easy he made it look
at Inkster as the No. 1 dual-
threat quarterback prospect in
the country?
When does Devin Gardner's
future escape his past?
Carter, who is now the athlet-
ic director and football coach at
Oak Park High School in metro
Detroit, started as an assistant
coach at Detroit St. Martin de
Porres, where he spent 17 years
before becoming the head coach
there for another 10. He won
three state championships. The
school closed in 2005, so he
went to Inkster, a program that
had never made the playoffs.
During his first year as the
head coach, Inkster made the
playoffs and reached three state
championships before Carter
left in 2011.
He's been successful not just
because of the Xs and Os, but
because he has a system that

requires even the toughest kids
to buy into it.
Players in Carter's program
rent jerseys from him weekly.
Every week he washes them,
and every week, the players are
required to give him progress
reports from their teachers,
complete with grades and com-
ments. If the reports aren't up
to Carter's standards, then the
players don't get a jersey that
week.
When Gardner's coach at
University of Detroit Jesuit
High School left the program,
Gardner's grades plummeted.
He had wanted to go to St. Mar-
tin de Porres, but the school
closed down the year before he
graduated from middle school.
So in November of his sopho-
more year, Gardner transferred
to Inkster. A year older, Gor-
don came in at the same time.
As soon as they arrived in his
office, Carter sent both of them
to the academic counselor to
see if they were even eligible to
graduate in four years. He knew
they were going to be incredible
football players, but he didn't
want football to overtake the
academics.
They both bought into the
system right away.
Gardner, who declined mul-
tiple interview requests for this
story, told CBSSports.com last
month, "My grades were really,
really bad at U of D. I wouldn't
have been able to go to college
had I not straightened up. Iowe
a lot to coach Carter."
He wasn't eligible to finish
the football season or play bas-
ketball in the winter, so Gard-
ner did nothing but schoolwork
for the first couple months of
his Inkster career. Carter had a
vision that Gardner was a much
better student than his grades
at Detroit Jesuit implied and
that he should be able to choose
what college he wanted to
attend regardless of admissions
standards.
"He came over, and we pro-
vided him some direction in
terms of what he needed to
do academically," Carter said.
"We always taught the kids that
we want them to use football.
We don't want football to use
them."
Gardner reached two state
championships in his two years
as quarterback for the Vikings.
Both times, they lost. Both
times, he was injured in the
semifinal game and wasn't at
100 percent.

But it was about more than
that - it still is about more than
that, more than just the foot-
ball field. Gardner always knew
what he was doing as an athlete,
but that wasn't important for
Carter. .
Last spring, Gardner gradu-
ated inthreeyearswith adegree
in Afro-American and African
studies and is now a first-year
Masters in Social Work student.
"(Gardner and Gordon) grad-
uated together last spring, and
that was one of my proudest
days," Carter said. "Notso much
their ability to play football, but
to see them develop into young
men and be able to handle all
the rigors of that kind of sched-
ule. Every one of the coaches
I've worked with in the past are
so proud of those guys.
"To have a chance to com-
plete his Masters by the time he
graduated ... you never would
have thought that when he
popped his head into Inkster as
a sophomore."
Without a doubt, Gardner
and Carter had a strong bond.
Jnkster still meant something.
In January of his senior year
of high school, Gardner was
set to graduate early from Ink-
ster and begin practicing in the
spring with Michigan. It was all
set up with the previous school
administration, everything
good to go.
But in a period of transition
for Inkster - which is a big rea-
son why Carter left the school -
there were two interim district
superintendents in two years.
Carter can't count how many
principals were there in his six
years, and it got to be too much
to handle.
Carter left Inkster in 2011,
and the entire Inkster school
district closed two years later.
The high school had less than
300 kids when Carter first
started. He left a school with an
enrollment of over 1,300 kids.
Inkster - like so many other
high schools in metro Detroit -
closed because of budget cuts.
Almost 1,000 students thought
they were going one place in
June 2013 but were forced to
relocate in August.
The rise was fast and power-
ful, but so was the demise.
"I don't want to trash any-
one because it serves no pur-

What to Watch for: Minnesota

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Four games through
the 2013 season, the No. 19
Michigan football team is
still the same riddle it was
when it began the year. The
Wolverines, it seems, are not
as good as they showed in
impressive early wins over
Central Michigan and Notre
Dame. Two subsequent ugly
wins proved that.
But, they're also not quite
as bad as their performances
against Akron and Connecti-
cut would suggest, either.
That leaves them somewhere
in between.
Michigan is still unde-
feated and, in a wide-open
Legends Division, remains
a viable contender. Whether
it can push for the division
title largely depends on just
a few moving pieces, mostly
on the offensive side of the
ball. An early test against an
improved Minnesota team
should provide some more
clarity.
Here's what to watch for
on Saturday:
1. Can Devin Gardner pro-
tect the ball?
This, of course, is the
most important question for
Michigan entering Big Ten
play. When Gardner doesn't
turn the ball over, he is one
of the best offensive weap-
ons in the conference.
When he does, he is the
Wolverines' biggest liability.
The turnover bug has been
maddening - last season,
Gardner never threw more
than one interception in his
six games as the starter. This
year, he has thrown multiple
interceptions in three out of
four games. In three straight
games, he has had a turnover
returned for a touchdown.
The frustrating part for
Gardner and his coaches is
that he hasn't repeated his
mistakes. He- has found new
ways to give the ball away. At
first, he found trouble when
he tried to throw the ball
rather than accept a sack.
But since, he has exhibited
poor reads, or even throws
lacking his typical accuracy.

PATRICK BARRO/Dai
The interior of the Michigan offensive line has been reshuffled during the two-week off period. Previously, it had struggled to establish the line of scrimmage in two close wins

Whether because of the
run of turnovers or some-
thing else, Gardner's throws
were off against UConn. For
the first time, he completed
fewer than half his passes.
The good news for Michi-
gan is that he has performed
up to his ability in the past.
Last year, Gardner threw for
1,319 yards, completed 59.5
percent of his passes and
scored 16 total touchdowns.
It all started with a start
against Minnesota with
just one week to prepare at
quarterback. In that game,
Gardner was 12-for-18 for
234 yards and three total
touchdowns. If he can use
this year's game to right the
ship, the Wolverines will be
just fine.
If not, it could be a long
Big Ten season.
2. Will changes on the
offensive line make a differ-
ence?
Behind Gardner, the
offensive line has been the
most troubling part of the
Michigan offense. The tack-
les have been as advertised.

But inside of fifth-year
seniors Michael Schofield
and Taylor Lewan, the inte-
rior has been overpowered
by weaker opponents.
That prompted Michigan
coach Brady Hoke to make a
change duringthe two weeks
in between games. Red-
shirt sophomore Jack Miller
has been pulled at center,
replaced by redshirt sopho-
more Graham Glasgow, who
shifts over from left guard.
Chris Bryant, another red-
shirt sophomore, will take
Glasgow's place at guard.
Before the game against
UConn, fifth-year senior
Fitzgerald Toussaint strug-
gled on the ground. When he
finally broke out two weeks
ago, he found room only on
the outside of the line.
Some of Gardner's strug-
gles, too, can be linked to the
line. He has been sacked nine
times and hurried another 11
times.
At 6-foot-4, 314 pounds,
Bryant has the size and
strength but has been bat-
teredbyleginjuries. Glasgow
worked at the center position
during camp and has played.

significantly better than the
other two interior linemen
so far. And Kalis has been
unspectacular but shows the
most potential.
This week will be a useful
barometer for the re-tooled
interior. Ra'Shede Hageman
is arguably the best nose
tackle in the conference.
3. Which offense will we
see?
A long four weeks ago,
against Notre Dame, the
Michigan offense looked
like it had finally fulfilled
the vision of offensive coor-
dinator Al Borges. Michi-
gan totaled 460 yards in
that game. The offense had
25 first downs and scored
41 points against the feared
Notre Dame defense.
Series after series, the
Wolverines showed new,
dangerous looks: the tradi-
tional power-I formation,
shotgun, pistol, read option,
quick pitches, stretch runs,
defense-stretching throws
over the top.
Gardner was precise
enough with his arm to keep

the secondary back. But he
was dangerous enough with
his legs to force the defense
to respect. the quarterback
run. In the red zone, Michi-
gan was near unstoppable.
But there were cracks
in the offense, even if they
weren't apparent at the
time. Notre Dame shut down
the interior run, so Borg-
es attacked the edge. The
offense required Gardner to
make the correct decisions.
Later, against Akron and
UConn, those problems bit
the Wolverines. Without
effective inside rushing,
the ground game became
one-dimensional. Gardner
faltered. Suddenly, Michi-
gan looked flat. At times,
it looked helpless. Borges,
who found a rhythm against
Notre Dame, couldn't against
Akron or UConn.
When Michigan's offense
clicks, it has the talent to
run Minnesota off the field.
But when it's off, the result
is ugly.
4. Will Michigan need the
defense to save it again?

For all the problems on the
offensive side of the ball, the
defense has been encourag-
ingly steady. Against UConn,
the defense allowed just one
touchdown on a full drive.
(UConn's offense scored
once more after a turnover in
the red zone.)
The Gophers shouldn't
provide much more of a test.
They rank 10th in the Big
Ten in total offense, ahead
of lowly Michigan State and
Purdue.
Michigan's defense has
been vulnerable in the area
behind the linebackers and
in front of the safeties, but
Minnesota hasn't shown an
ability to throw the ball: it
ranks last in the conference
in passing yards.
The Wolverines need-
ed the- defense to bail out
the offense against Akron,
with a late goal-line stand.
Against UConn, junior line-
backer Desmond Morgan's
one-handed interception
helped save the game.
The defense should be
able to smother Minnesota.
But Michigan can't rely on it
to save the day every game.

ball field is a power grid full
of generators, a mechanic's
garage and a strip club.
But for a while, the alma
mater of current Michi-
gan football players Devin
Gardner and Cam Gor-
don was a factory for kids
who needed second and
third chances, like Gard-
ner. It was where Greg
Carter - the athletic direc-
tor and football coach -
had a mural on his wall
of all the players he sent
to college, most of whom
wouldn't have had a fight-
ing chance without Inkster.
Most importantly, it was
the pride of a community
that needed something to
believe in.
Now, its doors are glued
shut and the handprints are
on the wrong side of the
windows.
"It's kind of odd saying
this with me being on the
team, but..." On the phone,
Nathan Lindsey's voice
trails off before he starts
laughing. Lindsey, along
with his brother Daniel,
played alongside Gardner
and Gordon at Inkster but
now live in Kansas, playing
for Fort Hayes State Uni-
versity.
"Man, it really was like
Devin and then the Ink-
ster Vikings," he said. "It
was. There's no other
way to put it. If
Devin wasn't
playing, the
chances
of us
going
to a

state championship that
year would have been so
slim. Especially going to a
state championship. ... Our
team was good, but Devin
was a very, very key part to
that. He took us to that next
level."
bevin and the Vikings
played every game of their
season on the road in 2009,
his senior year. Thirteen
in all. Trying to match his
quarterback's talent, Carter
scheduled games anywhere
from Muskegon, Mich., to
Cleveland.
Entering the last week
of the regular season, the
Vikings were 4-3 and had
to win their last game to
make the Michigan~ state
playoffs.
All Inkster had to do was
win in one of the toughest
road environments in all of
high-school football: Steu-
benville, Ohio,- which was
riding a 68-game winning
streak.
Steubenville is like no
place you've ever been. The
stands are less than 10 feet
from the sidelines, and vis-
iting fans aren't allowed to
sit in between the 30-yard
lines. Behind one end zone
is a massive, 200-person
band. Behind the other is a
cemetery.
The fog was rolling
in. Carter

says that the first and only
time he believed in ghosts
happened on that field.
It was a preview of The
Game for Devin - the
opposing fans knew of his
commitment to Michigan
and treated him like he was
already in Ann Arbor.
Late in the game and up
by a touchdown, Inkster
had the ball in its own red
zone when Steubenville
fired up the band. Gard-
ner and the offensive line
couldn't . hear anything.
False starts and illegal pro-
cedures pushed the offense
deep into its own territory.
Gardner finally got a
clean play
off. He saw
a defender

cuted so manytimes before,
the one where he heaves it
back across the middle of
the field after rolling out
right - never left. It was
his welcome-to-the-show
moment last year, the one
that made him famous in
his first collegiate start as
a quarterback against Min-
nesota.
If he rolled left, he'd still
be running. Instead, he
took a safety.
Steubenville wasted no
time scoring again. Ink-
ster got the ball back with
a minute left, downa point,
needing a win against a
team that hadn't lost in
more than six years.

on third down, Gardner
took the snap out of the
shotgun, looking left before
firing a high, spiraling rain-
bow downthe rightsideline
for a 64-yard touchdown
pass, bringing home a win
in a place where teams sim-
ply don't. He finished the
game with 275 yards pass-
ing, 55 yards rushing and
four touchdowns.
Four years later at
Michigan Stadium, Gard-
ner takes the snap and
rolls right, again, getting a
glimpse of the Notre Dame
band behind him before
retreating farther and fast-
er back toward his own end
zone. He keeps rolling back
until he's being tackled in
his own end zone, but he

Steubenville, he wasn't
goingto take that safety, so
he heaved the ball away as
he was going down, right
into the hands of a Notre
Dame defensive lineman.
After the game, Carter
saw his former quirterback
in the tunnel.
"Steubenville?" Carter
asked.
Gardner looked down
and shook his head. "Yeah,
coach. Steubenville."
"He's a riverboat gam-
bler," Carter said. "He's
going to try to do it. He'll
learn with experience
when to do it and when
not to do it. That's really
hard for' a kid that can do
just about anything, who
is a super talent. It's either

career, Gardner picked
himself up, ran back to the
sideline and led Michigan
on another touchdown
drive to win the game.
At this point, the prob-
lem with Gardner is that his
problems haven't changed.
That roll-right, across-the-
body heave that Michigan
is so familiar with? Carter
was trying to get him to
change that four years ago.
It's not cockiness, exact-
ly. It's more like the smart
kid who overcommits on a
group project but takes on
too much work and ends up
hurting the end result. If'
he didn't try to do as much,
the final product would
turn out smoother. It's not
because he thinks he's bet-
ter, just that he knows how
good he is, individually.
But that's just who he
is. It's the same reason he

DETROIT - The doors
where Devin Gardner
became Devin Gardner
have super glue in the locks.
Keys don't work here any-
more, not-at Inkster, where
budget cuts have taken a
once-proud community
and turned it into a block-
ade of buildings waiting for
demolition.
There are handprints on
the windows at the front of
the school - bigger than a
child's but smaller than an
adult's. Teenagers were
peering in through the

dusty windows, trying to
get a glimpse of what used
to be Inkster High School
in metro Detroit.
Officially, the school has
been shut down for three
months, but it looks like it's
been abandoned for years,.
as if one day Inkster was
operating, and the next
everyone picked up and
left. Gatorade bottles litter
the ground by the baseball
'field, which is now more of
an overgrown swamp than
a diamond.
Next to the cesspool is

the football field, which
still has pylons, scorebooks
and yard markers in the
press box. The red, rubber
surface of the track is slow-
ly disintegrating and the
grass is dying. Soon, it will
be an overgrown field sur-
rounded by a cement oval.
On the chain-link fence
surrounding the field, a
sign remains from last foot-
ball season: Adults, $5. Stu-
dents, $3.
Even in its prime, Inkster
was never glamorous or
flashy. Bordering the foot-
