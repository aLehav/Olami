Gov. Rick Snyder and state 

lawmakers 
are 
introducing 

bills to the state legislature 
that seek to combat the rising 
number of opioid overdoses by 
monitoring prescriptions more 
closely and enforcing opioid 
abuse education. Committees 
within the state House and 
Senate will begin testimony on 
more than a dozen measures to 
battle the epidemic.

The 
opioid 
epidemic 
in 

Michigan has been growing 
steadily, with the number 
of 
opioid 
prescriptions 

increasing from 180 million 
in 2007 to 690 million in 2016. 
Snyder said the new bills are 
a step in the right direction, 
though they aren’t an absolute 
solution.

“There is not just one step 

to solve this problem … it’s 
about our society, our culture 
changing,” Snyder stated. “So 
this is very comprehensive 
stuff. This won’t be the last 
step but another good step.”

Engineering 
freshman 

Lincoln 
Merrill, 
publicity 

chair of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Republicans, agreed.

“At this point, any measure 

taken against the drug that 
will help stop the unnecessary 
deaths it causes is welcome,” 
he said. 

New legislation announced 

Thursday 
has 
received 

bipartisan support. The bill 
limits 
the 
prescription 
of 

opioids, 
requires 
parental 

consent when prescribing to 
minors and requires public 
schools to educate about abuse. 
Patients’ drug histories will be 
tracked through an electronic 
database, as required by a new 
law.

The 
mandate 
on 
opioid 

education is said to look 
similar to a bill in Ohio that 

requires 
K-12 
students 
to 

be taught about the dangers 
of opioid use. If the bill 
passes, the program would 
be implemented by the 2018 
school year by the Michigan 
Department 
of 
Education. 

The 
bill 
was 
introduced 

by state Rep. Beth Griffin 
(R–Mattawan) 
and 
allows 

Michigan’s Prescription Drug 
and Opioid Abuse Commission 
to design a curriculum for 

high school students.

In 
an 
interview 
with 

WWMT 
radio 
station, 

Griffin said even prescription 
medications 
pose 
dangers 

students need to be aware of.

“As a mom with kids in 

sports, it’s good to know 
that 
this 
legislation 
will 

help educate my kids on the 
dangers of taking a drug, even 
if a doctor prescribed it,” 

Monday 
evening, 
students 

and faculty crowded into the 
Anderson Room of the Michigan 
Union for a panel discussion 
about 
minorities 
in 
public 

service, 
organized 
by 
LSA 

Student Government and LSA 
junior Zoha Qureshi.

LSA senior Julia Gips, LSA 

Student Government president, 
explained LSA SG organized the 
event in the hopes of reaching 
out to minority groups at the 
University of Michigan.

“There are a lot of people who 

feel underrepresented on this 
campus, and as president of LSA 
Student Government we had a lot 
of conversations about how we 
can make minority voices better 
heard,” she said.

Quershi said organizing the 

event was personal to her. 

“Being on the Diversity Affairs 

Committee and being the vice 
chair with that along with Ibtihal 
(Makki, an LSA senior), the 
purpose of DAC is to make sure 
that this campus is as inclusive 
as possible to people of different 
backgrounds

University 
of 
Michigan 

seniors have been expressing 
their 
dissatisfaction 
with 

the 
recent 
commencement 

announcement 
as 
there 

are no plans for a featured 
speaker. Many also believe the 
University is focusing too much 
on the bicentennial celebration 
instead of the graduating class 
of 2017.

The commencement speech 

will 
feature 
a 
multimedia 

project 
displaying 
current 

University faculty reading the 
words from previous speeches 
throughout the University’s 
history. 
Music, 
Theatre 

&

Prof. 
Malcolm 

Tulip, 
who 
is 
producing 

the 
exhibition, 
said 
the 

presentation 
will 
celebrate 

both the bicentennial and the 
current graduates.

“For years now, we have 

become used to seeing great 
speeches and events on video,” 
Tulip said in a University 

press release. “In the early 
days of the university this 
documentation did not exist 
or was lost. This project 
assembles a series of excerpts 
from 
significant 
speeches 

from the university’s past. In 
seven 
minutes, 
graduating 

students and their families 
will gain a sense of their place 
in the university and nation’s 
history.”

In the press release, Interim 

Provost Paul Courant said 
the 
bicentennial 
will 
not 

overshadow the students and 
their graduation.

“Graduation, as always, is 

principally about the academic 
achievements of the students 
who are graduating,” Courant 
said. “We are pleased and 
proud to honor them and their 
achievements.”

Despite Courant’s statement, 

seniors were frustrated with 
the speech presentation.

Public health professor Dr. Victor Stretcher discusses ways to “design a happy life” during his motivational presentation at the Michigan League on Monday.

Panelist provide different insights to students, attendees in a packed Vandenberg Room

The Vandenberg Room of 

the 
Michigan 
League 
was 

overflowing 
Monday 
night 

with students waiting to hear 
Dr. Victor Strecher, a professor 
of health behavior and health 
education in the School of 
Public Health, speak about 
“Designing a Happy Life,” an 
event aiming to speak about 
personal development.

The event was the inaugural 

lecture in a series organized by 
the LSA Student Honor Council, 
an organization dedicated to 
the importance of honorable 
behavior in the context of 
academia 
and 
scholarship, 

which seeks to hold the event 
annually.

Strecher 
attempted 
to 

illustrate ways to compute the 
way to happiness. 

“This is about designing your 

life,” Strecher said. “(But) I’m 
not saying I know everything 
either.”

Strecher 
asked 
students 

to 
identify 
their 
age, 
and 

found the crowd was a mix 
of 
undergraduate 
students, 

graduate students and parents 
from the community.

“Very likely when you were 

getting into the University of 
Michigan, your parents had a 
résumé for you,” Strecher said. 
“They had written your résumé 
for you in their mind. I’m going 
to 
take 
that 
metaphorical 

résumé they have for you and 
tear it up. Because it is not their 
life. It’s your life.”

Over 
the 
course 
of 
the 

next 
hour, 
Strecher 
veered 

from personal anecdotes to 
discussion 
of 
philosophical 

texts, drawing from the works 
of Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, 
Nietzsche, Buddhist philosophy 
and 
his 
own 
personal 

experiences to discuss factors 
that could lead to personal 
fulfillment and development.

At one point, Strecher asked 

the audience to think about 
their 
own 
deaths, 
taking 

inspiration from Steve Jobs’ 
commencement speech to the

The University of Michigan 

Dance Team, which performs 

on the sidelines at every home 

football and basketball game, 

is adding a new member to its 

successful squad — a member 

who will make history.

Future Dance Team member 

Brendan Ryan is “the first 

boy in history to make the 

University of Michigan Dance 

Team,” as he tweeted Sunday 

afternoon.

Final cuts for the team 

took place over the weekend, 

after which Ryan was officially 

named to the team.

Ryan’s accomplishment was 

widely celebrated by family 

and friends, and one of Ryan’s 

previous dance partners was 

particularly excited about the 

news.

In addition to performing 

at sporting events, performs 

annually at the Universal 

Dance Association’s College 

Cheerleading and Dance Team 

National Championship held 

in Orlando, Fla. The team 

consistently places in the top 10 

at this national competition.

Prior to the addition of 

Ryan to the team, the Michigan 

Dance Team was an all-female 

group. In fact, one of the 

“Frequently Asked Questions” 

on the team’s website asks how 

many girls are usually taken on 

the team.

Ryan could not provide 

comment to the Michigan Daily.

The addition of Ryan to 

the team will add a new face to 

the sidelines next year, but for 

now, as one of Ryan’s Twitter 

supporters noted, this is history 

in the making.

Cheyenne Turner, Community Support Specialist in the Children’s Services Department at 
the Washtenaw Youth Detention Center, discusses how disparities in the quality of educa-
tion in different communities at Hatcher Graduate Library on Monday.

E DUC ATIONAL ADVANCEM E NT

Ann 
Arbor 
might 
lose 

access to the funding required 
to move to the next phase of 
the building of a new Amtrak 
station. 

Though Ann Arbor officials 

have been trying for months 
to 
expedite 
the 
Amtrak 

process, they have yet to 
obtain the sign off on an 
environmental 
assessment 

from the Federal Railroad 
Administration 
required 

to 
continue 
the 
process. 

Officials are concerned the 
approval 
will 
come 
after 

the expiration of the federal 
grant funds allocated toward 
the project.

“Because we haven’t gotten 

that draft document done, we 
can’t start the process of doing 
preliminary 
engineering, 

so we haven’t expended any 
additional funds that (the 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council) 

has 
approved 
for 
that 

consultant agreement,” said 
City Administrator Howard 
Lazarus at a City Council 
meeting last week. 

The FRA is expected to 

have 
the 
environmental 

assessment report completed 
this 
summer. 
A 
30-day 

review period will follow. 
If completed on time, the 
federal grant funding, which 
was awarded in 2011 and 
expires Sept. 30, will still be 
available to the city. In an 
interview with MLive, FRA 
spokeswoman Desiree French 
said the organization is still 
working closely with the city 
to help it meet the funding 
deadline.

“Public release of the draft 

(environmental 
assessment) 

is 
still 
planned 
for 
this 

summer 
and 
will 
be 
an 

opportunity to obtain agency 
and public comment on the 
environmental analysis and 
the project,” French said.

As soon as the assessment 
is done, preliminary design 
and engineering will be 
completed 
by 
Neumann/

Smith 
Architecture, 
as 

voted on by City Council 
in January. The design and 
engineering 
is 
expected 

to cost $2.37 million, of 
which 
Neumann/Smith 

will get $2.14 million. With 
unallocated funding taken 
into account, the total cost 
of the project is expected to 
be nearly $2.5 million.

Of the total cost, $2 

million 
was 
expected 

to be reimbursed by the 
federal grant. Grant-funded 
work was expected to be 
completed by the end of 
March, 
allowing 
ample 

cushion 
time 
before 
its 

expiration date. Now, with 
the 
grant-funded 
work, 

there is a chance that the 
federal 
funding 
would 

be returned to the U.S. 
Treasury. The FRA cannot 
extend the expiration date, 
as it was a condition of the 
agreement.

Funding for building of new Amtrak 
station could be lost under FRA

Environmental assessment report yet to be completed, causing delay in construction

Public release 

of the draft

was originally mentioned back 
in October. She said LSA SG 
sent out a survey last semester 
to gauge student opinions on 
the announcement, and found 
some apprehension regarding 
the plans.

 “After polling 500 students 

(both seniors and younger), 
we found that 61% were upset 
that commencement wouldn’t 
follow the traditional pattern 
of having a speaker,” Gipps 
wrote. “I sent this information 
to 
President 
Schlissel 
in 

November 
... 
Unfortunately 

no changes were made to the 
original 
plan 
... 
Ultimately, 

our big day is shaping up to be 
underwhelming.”

LSA 
senior 
Nick 
Suárez 

echoed Gips and wrote in an 
email interview the current 
plan is very lackluster and 
doesn’t show a dedication from 
the University to its graduates.

“It was definitely a huge 

slap in the face to all the 

grads,” Suárez wrote. “The 
commencement 
speaker 
is 

really the only aspect of the 
whole event that many people 
even care about, so this is just 
another way the university 
shows its students how little it 
cares about us as individuals.”

Education 
senior 
Maggie 

Cowles wrote going from past 
commencement speakers such 
as former President Barack 
Obama and Michael Bloomberg 
to a recap of other speeches 
seems like a self-indulgent move 
from the University.

“I feel like we’ve spent four 

years building up to this, to our 
graduation, and hearing about 
all of these amazing speakers 
in the past,” Cowles wrote. “I’m 
from Ann Arbor, so I remember 
the 
year 
Obama 
came. 
I 

remember being so excited 
about 
who 
my 
graduation 

speaker 
would 
be, 
and 

anticipating it … It just really 
feels like the university is trying 
so hard to promote itself that it’s 
not at all concerned about what 
students actually want to see in 
commencement.”

Suárez wrote the tuition bill 

students have paid over their 
four years at the University 
merits 
a 
new 
speech 
for 

graduation.

“Considering the amount of 

money paid and debt accrued 
by so many of us, to reach 
our culminating moment and 
not have something to look 
forward to with this event is 
disheartening honestly,” Suárez 
wrote.

Cowles added the University 

is prioritizing the bicentennial 
over its students, emphasizing 
she would be able to watch 
old footage of commencement 
speeches at home but her own 
graduation should be something 
new.

“Nobody wants to sit in the 

big house and watch a video clip 
of graduation addresses aimed 
at different years — we want 
our own speaker with … our 
own ceremony,” Cowles wrote. 
“It’s taking away a huge part 
of graduation that, honestly, 
is the only part of the whole-
school graduation I was looking 
forward to.”

Griffin said.

The 
opioid 
usage 
online 

database, 
titled 
Michigan 

Automated 
Prescription 

System, will be implemented 
in April and provide a user-
friendly, comprehensive report 
of prescription history and 
usage to both the doctor and 
patient.

When 
announcing 
the 

system, Lt. Gov. Brian Calley 
(R) said database bill will be 
integral to monitoring opioid 
usage.

“It will give doctors real 

time information about the 
prescription 
history 
of 
the 

person they are dealing with,” 
Calley said. “You would think 
in this day and age that a doctor 
would have that ... but today 

that doesn’t exist.”

Additionally, 
state 
Sen. 

Tonya 
Schuitmaker 
(R–

Lawton) introduced legislation 
that 
mandates 
disciplinary 

action should a patient not 
report usage via the database.

To benefit those who already 

suffer from opioid addiction, 
state Rep. Andy Schor (D–
Lansing) introduced legislation 
that 
gives 
Medicaid 
users 

treatment options. Schor told 
U.S. News the opioid addiction 
is not a partisan issue, rather a 
universal one.

“We 
all 
know 
that 

prescription drug and opioid 
abuse is not a partisan issue, it’s 
not a Democrat or Republican 
issue, it’s happening in cities, 
it’s happening in townships, it’s 
happening in urban and rural 
areas,” Schor said.

Public Policy junior Rowan 

Conybeare, 
chair 
of 
the 

University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, agreed and said 
non-partisan cooperation will 
be integral to finding a solution.

“I’m very glad to see both 

parties working across the aisle 
to tackle this urgent problem in 
Michigan,” she said.

Michigan Attorney General 

Bill Schuette said in a statement 
arrests won’t solve the issue, 
and a systemic solution is 
needed.

“The 
opioid 
epidemic 
is 

sweeping 
across 
Michigan, 

with hardly a day going by 
that we don’t hear of an 
overdose 
or 
death 
caused 

by 
an 
opioid-based 
drug,” 

Schuette said. “We can’t arrest 
our way out of this problem. 
The bi-partisan package of 
legislation announced today is 
an important step in Michigan’s 
overall effort to curb this 
growing epidemic.”

mission of Michigan Medicine 
is to improve all three of these 
areas as much as possible.

“Our vision overall is to be 

outstanding in each of these 
areas, so in research, to really 
bring discovery to health as 
well as broaden the spectrum 
of research that we do; in 
education, to prepare today’s 
doctors 
and 
scientists 
for 

tomorrow,” Runge said.

Runge then outlined the 

curriculum 
changes 
the 

Medical School has undergone 
in the last few years. The new 
curriculum is meant to bring 
together the first two years 
of medical school into one, 
so students can start their 
clinical rotations and narrow 
in on a specialty sooner.

In the new curriculum, year 

one outlines the foundational 
medical 
sciences 
and 
year 

two goes over patient care 
and clinical practice. In year 
three, students start rotations 
to choose a clinical focus, and 
in year four, the focus is on 
developing physician leaders.

Runge also emphasized that, 

though 
Michigan 
Medicine 

can sometimes seem separated 
from the University, it shares 
many 
of 
the 
same 
goals, 

including increasing diversity, 
equity and inclusion, per this 
fall’s DEI plan.

“We also have … priorities 

in 
diversity, 
equity 
and 

inclusion,” he said. “This is 
really important in health 
care. People don’t think about 
it so much but people who are 
ill like to work with health 
care providers who understand 
them … When we’re ranked 
for 
diversity, 
among 
other 

academic 
medical 
centers, 

we look pretty good, but we 
don’t have nearly the level of 
diversity we need to. And it’s a 

tough uphill battle to increase 
that, so we’re focusing on 
starting 
with 
the 
medical 

students to do this.”

After Runge’s presentation, 

the committee moved into a 
Q&A session. SACUA member 
David Smith, a professor in the 
College of Pharmacy, began 
with an inquiry about how 
Runge felt clinical staff could 
be better integrated into the 
educational environment.

SACUA has spent a lot of time 

discussing whether or not they 
should extend the ability to 
become members of the Senate 
Assembly — a body traditionally 
reserved 
for 
tenure-track 

faculty — to clinical staff.

“We’ve had this discussion 

here as well, and it has to 
do with the status of the 
clinician 
scientist,” 
Smith 

said. “What are your views on 
how to integrate them into the 
Michigan culture? In other 
words, I don’t believe they’re 
part of the Senate (Assembly) 
… how do we get them more 
involved while also protecting 
some of the feelings of the 
people who have these tenure-
track appointments and want to 
preserve that integrity?”

Runge 
said 
Michigan 

Medicine has been considering 
this problem as well lately, 
and he finds the apprehension 
surrounding it to be well-
founded.

“There’s 
some 
of 
that 

tension in the Medical School 
but this group that we call 
‘clinical track’ is actually our 
largest group,” Runge said. 
“I think that group would 
like to feel like they’re more 
part of the mainstream, but 
I certainly understand the 
inherent 
tension, 
because 

they outnumber (tenure-track 
faculty members).”

SACUA Chair Bill Schultz, a 

professor of engineering, asked 
the next question. He wanted 
to know the pros and cons of 
having Runge act as both the 

dean of the medical school and 
the executive vice president of 
medical affairs.

“We were sort of blindsided 

by the president in the fall of 
last year in you becoming both 
the executive vice president 
and the dean simultaneously,” 
Schultz said. “He indicated 
that this wasn’t that uncommon 
in medical schools, but … I’m 
wondering if you could talk 
briefly about the advantages of 
becoming both the executive 
vice president and the dean, 
and the disadvantages?” 

According 
to 
Runge, 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel was correct in saying 
this practice is not uncommon 
among 
top-tier 
medical 

schools that also own their 
own hospital systems. This 
helps the University, though, 
by allowing the two entities to 
work more collaboratively.

“It’s common among places 

we 
consider 
peers, 
which 

are the highest level medical 
schools who own their own 
hospitals,” Runge said. “The 
advantage is it really aligns 
decision-making on how you 
divide your resources … The 
big disadvantage is no one 
person can do all that, that’s 
just the reality. This allows us 
to have three really important 
vice deans who have important 
portfolios and it makes them 
work together.” 

Once Runge left, the SACUA 

members once again brought 
up the issue of clinical staff in 
the Senate Assembly. Smith 
ended the meeting by saying he 
felt it was important to gauge 
the interest in clinical staff 
of being part of the assembly 
before moving forward with 
any action.

“I think it’s important to see 

what level of interaction they 
want,” Smith said. “They may 
be perfectly happy not getting 
involved, and there may be 
some that want to get involved 
in different levels.”

Dave Wright, SACUA Vice Chair and Business professor, discusses potential candidates for the SACUA board in the Fleming Administration 
Building on Monday. 

SACUA

graduating class of Stanford 
University in 2005.

“Imagine 
your 
memorial 

service,” he said. “Visualize 
your 
headstone 
with 
your 

name on it. What does your 
epigraph say?”

Eventually, 
Strecher 

turned to the idea of finding 
personal fulfillment. He spoke 
about the diagnosis of his 
daughter’s heart condition as 
the beginning of him living 
his life with purpose, saying 
he wanted to give her a big life 
while it was possible for her, 
which in turn made him want 
to live a more involved life.

Closing 
remarks 
were 

followed by large applause 
from the audience, after which 
he opened up for questions. 

Business and LSA junior 

Claire Yerman, the LSA Student 
Honor Council president, was 
excited Strecher was able to 
speak. 

“We reached out to Vick 

because we knew his deep 
commitment to talking about 
purpose 
and 
we 
thought 

that aligned really well with 
integrity, which is our main 
focus,” Yerman said. “We really 
felt that if he could talk about 
living your life authentically — 
which he did — then this really 
aligns with integrity, because 
unless you are staying true 
to yourself and living true to 

your values, you are really not 
showcasing integrity.”

Anna Moshkovich, an LSA 

senior presently taking a gap 
year, was initially drawn to 
the talk by emails sent by the 
Newnan Advising Center.

“I’m doing a gap year and I 

didn’t know (Dr. Strecher) was 
so big into gap years,” she said. 
“I have no idea where I’m going 
to be placed and it is through 
a 
Jewish 
Peace-Corps-type 

program. His whole talk was 
about how we should go out of 
our comfort zone and do things 
that scare us.” 

When 
asked 
if 
she 
felt 

confident in her current plans 
after listening to the talk, 
Moshkovich responded: “100 
percent.”

SPEAKER

identities, and we want to make 
sure minority students especially 
feel welcome here,” she said. “And 
then we realized that also there 
are a lot of minority students 
who might want to explore the 
realm of public service, like for 
example me — public service is 
something I see in my future 
career and I wanted to give them 
an opportunity to see people who 
have already done successful 
things in that realm.”

Given the recent political 

climate, the panel emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
minority 

representation 
in 
the 

traditionally white-majority field 
of public service, and what steps 
need to be taken to continue 
to 
encourage 
more 
diverse 

involvement. The panel allowed 
five public service leaders to 
reflect on their experiences in 
the Michigan community.

Abdul El-Sayed, a physician 

and 
current 
candidate 
for 

governor of Michigan, was one 
of the panelists in attendance. 
El-Sayed explained that he left 
left his job as a professor at 
Columbia University to dedicate 
his efforts to public service 
in Detroit. One of his projects 
included creating a program that 
provided every child in Detroit 
with glasses.

“The fights are worth fighting, 

and justice will get done if you 
do it,” he said, explaining to the 
audience the importance of not 
being a victim of circumstance 
and encouraging minorities to 
push through discrimination.

Alford Young, the chair of 

the Department of Sociology, 
explained how the majority of 
his research was inspired by 
his background as an African-
American man. Growing up in 
a neighborhood in New York, 
Young saw how many of his 
friends were stereotyped based 
on their race.

“Almost all social service 

agencies think of Black men as 
men with problems,” he said. “I 
say there are more to these men 
than just problems.”

Martha Jones, director of the 

Michigan Law Program in Race, 
Law and History and professor of 
African-American studies, also 
learned about the dynamics of 
giving back in her childhood.

“In 
my 
family, 
whenever 

you got a break, the lesson was 
always how to pay that forward,” 
she said, explaining that this led 
to her own profession as a lawyer 
for 
people 
in 
marginalized 

communities.

Another 
panelist, 
Awilda 

Rodriguez, 
is 
an 
assistant 

professor in the Center for 
the 
Study 
of 
Higher 
and 

Postsecondary Education who 
researches the representation 

of Black, Latino, low-income 
and 
first-generation 
students 

in 
postsecondary 
education. 

Rodriguez 
shared 
her 
own 

childhood 
experience, 
saying 

she grew up valuing education, 
but noticed that fewer minority 
students tended to rise to higher 
schooling levels.

“There is such a lack of 

diversity, 
especially 
in 
high 

educational policy space where 
you could have a happy hour 
and easily fit everyone that 
was of color working on higher 
education policy in one corner,” 
she pointed out.

Student activists on campus 

also served as speakers for the 
events. LSA senior Nicole Khamis 
is the founder of the Michigan 
Refugee Assistance Program and 
is currently an intern for the U.S. 
State Department. Khamis was 
inspired to create MRAP because 
her parents are refugees from 
Palestine.

“I’ve tried to take my time here 

at Michigan to raise people up, 
and show that everyone deserves 
the same opportunities that I 
have,” she said.

Khamis also emphasized that 

people of color should be able to 
have their own operating spaces 
to cultivate an identity.

P

resident Donald Trump’s 
recent budget blueprint 
for the fiscal year 2018 

calls for several major cuts 
to 
departments 

and 
organizations 

that used to garner 
bipartisan 
support, 

like 
the 
National 

Institutes of Health. 
These budget changes, 
particularly the $5.8 
billion reduction of 
the NIH budget, hold 
severe 
ramifications 

for medical scientists 
who rely on the NIH 
to fund grants that help 
make groundbreaking research 
on deadly diseases such as cancer 
and HIV. 

The budget fails to justify 

the cuts to the NIH, except 
for mentioning it needs to 
“focus resources on the highest 
priority research.” This raises 
the question of what “highest 
priority research” refers to. 
Looking at a recent categorical 
spending report from 2016 gives 
one a sense of what current 
spending priorities may be. 
Among the most funded areas 
are cancer, clinical research 
and biotechnology. 

Could 
these 
priorities 

change? This question suggests 
two possible answers. The NIH 
could either drastically reduce 
funding for all programs, or 
it could cut smaller programs 
that benefit fewer people (but 
are still important, like the 
Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality, which seeks to 
“produce evidence to make 
health care safer, higher quality, 
more accessible, equitable, and 
affordable, and to work within 
the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services and with 
other partners to make sure 
that the evidence is understood 
and used”). The possibility of 
NIH funding being reduced 
in any of these research areas 
questions the priorities of this 
administration 
and 
whether 

these 
priorities 
truly 
put 

“America First,” as Trump’s 
budget plan boasts.

Many such scientists do 

research here at the University 
of 
Michigan 
and 
would 

be 
significantly 
affected 

by 
a 
reduction 

in 
funding 
for 

their 
work. 
As 

the 
quantity 
and 

quality of research 
work falls due to the 
drop in funding, the 
world-renowned 
medical centers in 
the United States, 
like 
Michigan 

Medicine, will be 
left 
shorthanded 

in the battle against 

diseases like cancer. Moreover, 
a 
reduction 
in 
research 

funding would mean that not 
only would scientists have 
less money available for raw 
materials, 
but 
they 
would 

also have less available to pay 
staff and research assistants 
at both the undergraduate 
and 
graduate 
levels 
— 
a 

consequence 
that 
would 

have a ripple effect on the 
affordability of the academic 
experience at this school for 
students interested in pursuing 
extracurricular involvement in 
the biomedical sciences.

My parents, immunologists 

who 
specialize 
in 
B 
cell 

transplantation 
for 
the 

Department 
of 
Surgery 
at 

Michigan 
Medicine, 
employ 

a handful of students in their 
laboratory who assist with their 
research. A reduction in funding 
for them would translate to 
fewer educational opportunities 
in the medical sciences (if any 
at all) for these students, which 
would consequently stifle both 
the advancement of important 
biomedical 
research. 
Grant 

funding also helps to pay their 
salaries, as well as the salaries 
of other scientists. The salaries 
of lab assistants and janitors are 
also, in part, made possible by 
the University’s grant funding. 
Cuts to this funding would result 
in significant salary reductions 
and, consequently, reductions in 
the quality of life enjoyed by my 
family and others who work in 

the medical sciences.

Some may argue it is not the 

responsibility of the government 
to provide funding for academic 
endeavors like the pursuit of 
scientific research, suggesting 
that 
such 
funding 
can 
be 

provided for by charities such 
as the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation 
or 
the 
Howard 

Hughes Medical Institute. The 
issue 
with 
these 
charitable 

organizations being the sole 
resource for funding lies in 
the fact that the support they 
offer is more limited than the 
NIH, due to the comparatively 
limited financial pull they have. 
For example, a 2014 annual 
report for the Gates Foundation 
showed a total grant support of 
$3.86 million, spread across the 
areas of global development, 
global health, U.S. programing, 
global policy and advocacy, 
communications 
and 
other 

charitable programs.

Even 
within 
the 
overall 

NIH grant support budget, 80 
percent goes to outside research. 
Funding is spread across several 
other 
microprograms, 
like 

the 
Accelerating 
Medicines 

Partnership 
(which 
studies 

Alzheimer’s Disease and type 2 
diabetes). In contrast, the Gates 
Foundation has much more of 
a focus on global health issues 
(like malaria) than on private 
research. I believe it is the 
responsibility of the government 
to protect the people it serves, 
and I cannot see how limiting 
funding for life-saving medical 
research serves to protect the 
people of this country.

It is imperative that we do 

not 
allow 
this 
presidential 

administration to strip students 
and scientists of opportunities 
that contribute to the physical 
well-being of society at large. 
If this leadership insists on 
putting 
“America 
First,” 
it 

should focus on placing the 
health of its citizens among its 
highest “priorities.” 

I

t’s done! The dreaded 
University of Michigan 
Central 
Student 

Government election season 
is over and we have a winner: 
eMerge! 
Congratulations; 
I 

know you all worked very hard 
and wanted this more than 
anything you’ve wanted thus 
far in your campus careers. 
Your campaign was astounding 
and historical, and I do not 
want to discredit your win in 
any way whatsoever, but this 
campus owes an apology to 
LSA junior Evan Rosen, who 
ran for president with the 
Movement Party. Here’s why.

During 
campaigns, 
it 
is 

more than fair to attack a 
candidate’s 
qualifications, 

platform or ideas. However, 
those 
supporting 
eMerge 

didn’t do that. For the last two 
weeks, I’ve seen Rosen’s name 
defiled. I’ve heard students in 
my classes, who I don’t know, 
refer to Rosen as “racist,” 
“sexist” and other horrendous 
names I don’t feel comfortable 
publishing. Not the viral rap 
video — Rosen himself.

And what was worse? When 

these comments — and other, 
similar 
comments 
— 
were 

raised online, I saw eMerge 
team members like them. With 
their big blue profile pictures, 
I saw virtual endorsements of 
these kinds of personal attacks. 
It was the ugliest campus 
politics I had ever seen. To 
see people compare Rosen to 
President Donald Trump was 
also disheartening and wrong. 
Rosen’s political beliefs, as 
demonstrated 
through 
the 

first CSG debate, are very in 
line with those of eMerge and 
the Defend Affirmative Action 
Party. But no, that didn’t fit the 
narrative that worked for his 
opponents. So he, by default, 
had to be evil and Trumpian.

What did Rosen do when 

faced with these attacks? Any 
rational person would fight 
back or defend themselves. 
However, being the poised 
person he is, Rosen responded 
to his team by saying in a 
GroupMe 
message 
to 
the 

Movement team: 

“Hey guys: real quick I 

want to make it clear in here 
that anyone who was offended 
by our video absolutely has 
the right to be,” he wrote. 
“While we may not share their 
reaction, we have no right to 
tell them what to feel, ever, 
period. 
We 
haven’t 
taken 

the video down yet because 
I think it’s doing more good 
for this community than it 

is bad. That doesn’t mean 
these people’s feelings aren’t 
legitimate. Please keep that 
in mind, not just as a member 
of this party, but as a fellow 
human being. We must always 
try 
to 
understand 
before 

we project our beliefs and 
experiences 
onto 
others. 

And it doesn’t matter how 
many people it is. Nobody is 
wrong or right. Everybody is 
FEELING 
different 
things. 

Remember that. Thank you.”

If it wasn’t clear then, it 

must be clear now that Rosen is 
a class act. While you may not 
like the contents of his video, 
he eventually showed that he 
understood 
where 
students 

were coming from and didn’t 
try to discredit their feelings.

Generally, there was little 

talk of platforms or ideas, of 
which Movement had a lot. 
But to the public eye, there 
was only that video. A video 
with the intention of getting 
more students aware of an 
election. A video that did just 
that. To discuss or debate 
the contents of that video at 
this point is redundant and 
irrelevant, but let me make one 
thing clear: Whether you were 
offended by it, laughed at it or 
didn’t understand it, Rosen 
empathized 
with 
you 
and 

didn’t try to change your mind. 
Rosen held his head high the 
whole time, through attacks, 
unfair media treatment and 
even a little bit of possible 
debate sabotage.

But instead, his opponents 

decided 
to 
paint 
a 
false 

narrative of racism and not 
respecting the stories and 
struggles of communities of 
color. After the video was 
taken 
down, 
the 
backlash 

didn’t stop. Apologies didn’t 
matter and taking the video 
down didn’t matter, people 
wanted Rosen to be their 
“privileged” villain. He could 
do no right in their eyes.

Michigan, I want you to 

take a look in the mirror. Is 
this how we’re going to treat 

any candidate who comes into 
CSG and wants to do things 
differently? Are we going to 
persecute them in front of 
the court of public opinion 
until they are nothing but 
a 
pulverized 
social 
media 

disaster? Are we going to keep 
calling them “dangerous for 
UM,” as written on a Facebook 
post 
by 
eMerge 
Party 

candidate Brittney Williams, 
a Social Work student, even 
though they never got the 
chance to talk about how 
they planned to bring more 
diversity to campus? Could 
Rosen 
have 
chosen 
his 

words better to be a bit more 
sensitive? 
Absolutely. 
Was 

criticism of him taken way too 
far? I believe so.

Rosen deserved to have 

his ideas talked about. Rosen 
deserved to debate. Rosen 
deserved better. Rosen’s name 
has been tarnished by this 
campus — and for what? For a 
CSG election? Rosen tried to 
right a wrong, but everyone 
refused to listen since he must 
be demonized to fit the story. 

Congratulations 
eMerge: 

Like I said, I think you all 
worked very hard for this, 
and I look forward to you, 
hopefully, 
keeping 
your 

campaign promises, but please 
acknowledge that Evan Rosen 
and 
the 
Movement 
Party 

represent a wider cross section 
of the student body that is fed 
up with the same old CSG 
that we just re-elected. We, 
as the University of Michigan, 
should be approaching the 
issues raised in this election 
with 
a 
more 
constructive 

dialogue 
— 
something 
all 

parties could have done better. 
That is not how the Leaders 
and the Best act. Let’s interact 
with more respect, because 
this campaign season showed 
there is a serious lack of that.

I have many friends in CSG 

who have asked me, “How do 
I get more people to respect 
CSG?” 
Well, 
here’s 
your 

answer: Respect those who run 
against you. Respect those who 
campaign differently than you. 
Respect people when they try 
to right their wrongs. Today I 
am ashamed to be a Wolverine. 
Not because Movement lost, 
but because of how they lost. 
So on behalf of this campus 
and everyone who won’t say it: 
I am sorry, Evan Rosen.

I 

was disappointed by the 
University of Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
loss 

March 23, but was thrilled 
by the women’s basketball 
win! 
Title 
IX 
has 
only 

leveled certain aspects of 
women’s athletics on campus. 
Unfortunately, The Michigan 
Daily 
continually 
sells 

women’s athletics short in 
how it features stories. Yes, 
it offers the same quantity of 
coverage story for story, but 
look at the feature.

Look at the front page, look 

at the total word count and 
look at the color versus black-
and-white photos. The Daily’s 
front page on March 24 was 
about the men’s loss in full 
color and featured a full piece 
on page eight — in full color. 
The women’s win is covered 

in detail, but only in black 
and white on page seven. The 
front page today should have 
read: 
Women’s 
basketball 

moves on to Women’s National 
Invitation 
Tournament 

quarterfinals! 
Everyone 
in 

the student body should show 
up to support them at home 
games. The front page could 
have had a smaller tease 
stating the men came home 
with a tough loss and have 
more coverage in black and

I have two daughters and 

two foster daughters — we 
attend many women’s athletic 
events and rarely see them 
treated equally in coverage 
or 
hype. 
The 
Michigan 

Daily needs to encourage all 
our students to attend and 
support our women’s sporting 

events as much as we do our 
men’s. The WNIT games on 
March 18 and March 25 were 
very poorly attended. There 
were far more students in the 
band, cheer and dance teams 
than students in the crowd. 
Please work to correct this 
imbalance. Take an active 
stance on supporting the 
women — at least to the 
level to which the paper 
highlights the men. It will 
have a positive effect across 
our community. I hope to see 
you and many other students 
at the women’s game.

‘Seas’ is a fascinating look 
into one family’s challenge

Ann Arbor Film Festival presents a tale of a family at sea

You’ve 
probably 
never 

heard of the Griffith family, 
despite the fact that they’re 
among the most accomplished 
American sailors in history. 
The family undertook 20 ocean 
voyages over two decades, 
including 
three 
separate 

circumnavigations. 
They’ve 

been 
marooned 
on 
desert 

islands, 
navigated 
through 

miles and miles of treacherous 
icebergs and nearly drowned 
more times than they can 
count. They live their lives 
according 
to 
the 
call 
of 

adventure, untethered by the 
trappings of modern society.

“Following 
Seas,” 
a 

documentary shown at the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Film 
Festival 

made by Tyler J. Kelley and 
Araby Williams, is the story 
of the Griffiths, as told by 
the matriarch, Nancy. Her 
narrations 
are 
set 
to 
the 

footage she took while at sea 
over the years on 16-millimeter 
film. The result is fascinating 
— a film filled with stories of 
adventure, 
love, 
heartbreak 

and visceral panic.

They are truly a family of 

explorers, in the oldest possible 
sense of the word. Nancy’s 
husband, Bob, had been a 
successful veterinarian until 
one day he decided he couldn’t 
take it anymore, and so he took 

his daughter (an act that Social 
Services 
had 
described 
as 

“kidnapping”) and went off to 
sea. He met Nancy in Honolulu 
Harbor in 1960, and the two of 
them got married and raised 
their family at sea.

Nancy tells her stories in 

a deadpan voice, which feels 
somewhat 
juxtaposed 
with 

her subjects: that time she was 
stranded on a desert island 
and lived self-sufficiently for 
three months, or that time she 
found out she was 
pregnant 
while 

on 
a 
Russian 

naval 
base 
in 

Antarctica. 
Her 
matter-of-

factness is part 
of 
what 
makes 

her family’s story 
so compelling — 
she’s interesting 
because of what 
she did, not how 
she spoke. They 
traveled without 
GPS, any way to communicate 
with the world or money (most 
of the time). It was just the 
family, a 53-foot boat they built 
themselves, a chronometer and 
some maps.

According 
to 
a 
post-

screening Q & A with the 
filmmakers, 
it 
took 
about 

six years to finish the film. 
Most of that time was spent 
not gathering the footage — 
Nancy supplied that herself 
— but gaining the trust of the 

Griffiths needed to put the 
whole story together. They 
experienced 
some 
horrible 

losses in their travels, losses 
that could be expected given 
the danger that constantly 
loomed 
over 
their 
lives, 

but awful nonetheless. The 
filmmakers’ empathy for their 
subjects is clear in the way 
they edited the film, with 
a deft sense of humor and a 
precise eye for the detail that 
makes the Griffith family’s 

lives 
transcend 

from a collection 
of anecdotes to a 
complete story.

There’s a keen 

sense of nostalgia 
to 
“Following 

Seas.” 
Whether 

that be because of 
the omnipresent 
16mm 
footage 

or the fondness 
with which those 
interviewed 
talk 
about 
the 

old days, I don’t know, but it 
lets the film hit the audience 
gently. Not with a sudden rush 
of forced sympathy, but with 
a quiet yet focused empathy. 
Kelley and Williams aren’t 
here to force awe or judgment 
on the Griffiths — they’re just 
along for the ride. It’s a lovely, 
warm film, one that deserves to 
go beyond the festival circuit 
to wide release. We could all 
do with a little more adventure 
in our lives.

Problematic presentation 
of pregnancy in the media

Where we go wrong at the intersections of social media and health

UNIVERSAL PICTURES

Alicia Vikander in “Ex Machina”
Can computers create?

The question of artificial intelligence originally raised by Turing

Can computers think?
Alan Turing, the closest thing 

computer science nerds have to a 
god, first posed this question in 
1950.

Today, I ask: Can computers 

create?

Before I dive into the second 

question I want to talk about 
the first one: Can computers 
think? 
Computer 
scientist 

Edsger W. Dijkstra countered 
this 
with 
another 
question: 

Can a submarine swim? And 
by extension, can an airplane 
fly? All three examples involve 
technology achieving a certain 
naturally 
defined 
endgame. 

Submarines swim, but not like 
fish. Airplanes fly, but not like 
birds. 
Resultantly, 
computers 

think, but not like humans.

We see submarines and planes 

as successful because they are 
able to navigate the seas and skies. 
To reach a similar bar of success, 
a computer that thinks should 
make decisions as rationally as 
human do. 

Computers can’t do this yet, 

but the entire field of Artificial 
Intelligence 
has 
emerged 
in 

pursuit of this goal. And in the 
past decade it has exploded.

Given that in a mere half 

century we have seen computers 
evolve from cluttering entire 
rooms to fitting into our pocket, 
making a machine that thinks 
seems like a realistic goal. Google 
Director of Engineering Ray 
Kurzweil, an incredibly accurate 
technology forecaster, said at the 
SXSW conference last month that 
this moment could be upon us 
come year 2029.

So if we wait a couple decades, 

there’s a good chance we’ll be able 
to definitively answer yes to the 
first question. And although this 
might seem menacing, I assure 
you there’s nothing inherently 

dangerous or scary about AI. Ex 
Machina is fiction. At its core, AI 
is a collection of algorithms and 
agents like Siri and Alexa are just 
a bunch of lines of code.

Now that we’ve theorized 

about the first question, we turn 
to the arguably more compelling 
question: Can computers create?

It’s one thing for a machine to 

drive itself across the country, 
but can a machine record the 
next 10/10 Pitchfork album? (Can 
anyone for that matter? I won’t 
launch into that debate right 
now though.) Or can a machine 
create the next Starry Night? For 
a computer to be innovative, its 
abilities must span far beyond 
mere thought.

The world has already seen 

some early attempts at creative 
AI agents, especially in the music 
field. Last week, a high school 
student 
debuted 
a 
machine-

learning library that uses Kanye 
West lyrics to create its own 
ad-libs. Last year, Flow Machines, 
a project funded by the European 
Research Council, released two 
songs composed by a computer, 
though the production, mixing 
and lyrics are human-generated.

Despite 
the 
buzz 
and 

flashy headlines, the resulting 
compositions 
fall 
far 
short 

of the goal of creativity. The 
computer can rhyme, but the 
rhythm structure and wordplay 
is lacking. The Flow Machines 
tracks, developed in the style of 
The Beatles and Duke Ellington, 
sound like they came from 
their 
respective 
influencer’s 

discography. There was nothing 
new in the actual composition.

But just because these AI 

agents don’t meet the standard, 
doesn’t mean that none ever will. 
To reason about the future of this 
technology, we must consider 
what creativity is.

Steve Jobs said, “Creativity is 

just connecting things.” I think 
he’s pretty spot on. No musician 
exists 
without 
influences; 

no 
painter 
creates 
without 

predecessors. Artists look at what 
already exists — be it current 
events, society or other art — and 
rearrange select pieces in a way 
that has not been done before.

As we learn more about the 

neuroscience behind creativity, 
we 
will 
eventually 
pinpoint 

what 
makes 
a 
high-quality 

creative connection and develop 
technology that reflects this. It is 
likely that someday machines will 
be able to create like humans.

This doesn’t mean that artists 

will be obsolete, though. As I 
said before, there is something 
inherently 
different 
about 

creativity and thought. A self-
driving 
car 
is 
successful 
if 

it drives, but an artificially 
intelligent artist is not successful 
if it merely creates something.

Artists are so much more than 

their art; they impact society and 
pop culture in ways that machines 
cannot. Kanye West, Lady Gaga, 
Frank Ocean — hell even Taylor 
Swift — all have reputations and 
societal impact that is infused 
into their music. You can’t listen 
to Kanye without thinking about 
his latest Twitter rant, or Swift 
without considering her latest 
breakup.

Machines don’t have emotions 

or 
personality. 
They 
could 

contribute 
industry-changing 

innovation, 
but 
the 
entire 

experience would fall short of a 
human artist’s.

Regardless, computers have 

the potential to compete with 
humans creatively. We shouldn’t 
see this as a threat though. 
Some of the best art results 
from competition. Considering 
that for years now the arts have 
struggled to be taken seriously 
by 
government 
and 
society, 

a creative revamp might be 
just what the industry needs. 
Although we might have to wait 
a while for it, creative AI could 
eventually spark a new artistic 
golden age.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

If you type into Google the 

phrase, “am I pregnant,” the first 
autofill that comes up now is “am 
I pregnant video.” The video 
that this popular search refers is 
actually titled, “how is prangent 
formed.”

In case you haven’t seen or heard 

of this video, a quick explanation: 
Published on Youtube on October 
20th, this video consists of several 
screenshots of the question “am I 
pregnant?” or variations of it from 
Yahoo Answers. This video went 
viral quickly after being published; 
every time I checked Facebook for 
a few weeks, people were sharing it 
on each other’s walls, and I’m still 
seeing it pop up occasionally. Now, 
it has more than 8 million views.

The first time I watched it, it 

was without sound and I thought 
it was a poverty porn type of 
video — something made to pull 
on heartstrings. I thought that if 
I turned up the volume, I would 
hear that song they play during 
the ASPCA ads, and there would 
be a somber voiceover talking 
about women who have no access 
to healthcare or education or birth 
control or something along those 
lines.

After I watched it with volume, 

I wished it had been that simple. 
The guy doing the voiceover reads 
every single question out loud in 
a “funny” voice. The humour is 
supposed to come from the fact 
that he pronounces everything 

phonetically, including people’s 
spelling mistakes, and doesn’t 
correct any grammar. He reads 
one in a in a stereotypical Southern 
accent (around the 47 second mark, 
in case you’re curious), presumably 
because of the use of the word ain’t: 
“Girlfriend aint had period since she 
got pregat?”

I get it, the narrator’s voice is 

funny, sure, whatever. But these 
questions aren’t funny 
at all, especially when 
you 
consider 
that 

anyone who is turning 
to Yahoo answers for 
something as serious 
as pregnancy must not 
have very many other 
options. Some of the 
most 
off-putting 
or 

concerning asks include: 
“How can a nine year 
old get prangnet,” “are 
these systoms of being 
pregarnt,” “Did most you women 
FEEL pgrenant before find out?” 
and “How long can u go being 
prognant to get an abortian?”

I don’t know anything about 

the women who typed these 
questions into Yahoo answers. But 
the sheer volume of them suggest 
that there are women out there 
who need answers, haven’t had 
access to education about how 
the reproductive system works, 
feel alienated from their bodies, 
maybe never went to high school, 
can’t speak English well and/

or don’t have anywhere else to 
turn to for answers. Of course, we 
already knew that, but this is visual 
evidence. I’m still unclear as to 
how this is actually funny, when 
you think about the implications.

I’m not trying to shame anyone 

for liking a video where some guy 
speaks in a funny voice, nor am I 
a “feminist who can’t take a joke.” 
Hearing a guy read these questions 

out loud — a guy 
who has presumably 
never had to worry 
about the possibility 
or 
implications 
of 

becoming pregnant — 
was jarring enough. 
But seeing so many 
people on my social 
media 
feeds 
who 

I know care about 
women’s 
issues 

(and 
human 
rights 

in 
general) 
spread 

this video as if it were devoid of 
political implications was also 
unsettling. And for people who 
consider themselves vehemently 
pro-life 
and 
believe 
the 

government should ban abortions, 
it’s worth asking yourselves how 
you can want to deny women that 
option, and yet laugh at this video 
which shows some women clearly 
seeking alternatives and unable to 
find them.

I feel like I’ve seen an increase 

in 
coded 
messages 
revolving 

around pregnancy in the media 

recently, or maybe I’m just paying 
more attention. There was that 
X-ray of a pregnant snake that went 
viral after Hank Green tweeted it, 
as people starting tagging Taylor 
Swift and then making jokes about 
sending it to their ex-girlfriends. 
Then there was U.S. Rep. Steve 
King (R - Iowa) ’s comment that 
went viral, “We can’t restore our 
civilization with somebody else’s 
babies,” in reference to immigration 
issues. 
While 
thinking 
about 

these happenings, I couldn’t help 
but recall the memoir “Left to 
Tell: Discovering God Amidst 
the 
Rwandan 
Holocaust,” 
by 

Immaculée Ilibagiza. It’s a haunting 
narrative about genocide, human 
cruelty, sorrow, and unbelievably, 
forgiveness. I was too young when 
I read it, but there are a few lines 
seared into my memory, including 
a chant that people would use 
as inspiration for killing anyone, 
including pregnant women and 
children, they came across: “A 
baby snake is still a snake, let none 
escape.”

I’m 
not 
making 
a 
direct 

correlation between viral twitter 
comments, memes or videos and 
genocidal mindsets. But it’s worth 
thinking about how, in the media, 
what we sometimes mindlessly 
consume affects our engagement 
with the concept of pregnancy — 
and why we find certain things 
funny when they’re not attached to 
a real name or face.

Clark and Brown bring 
lyrical poetry to Literati

Two previous poet laureates who test the limits of lyricism 
and performance to present their recent poetry at Literati

Literati welcomes poets Fleda 

Brown and Patricia Clark to share 
selections from both of their latest 
published collections, each focused 
on the natural world.

Fleda Brown, a former poet 

laureate of Delaware from 2001 to 
2006, currently resides in Traverse 
City where she writes for the 
Record Eagle. Brown will read 
from her new book, “The Woods 
Are On Fire: New & Selected 
Poems,” as part of the Ted Kooser 
Contemporary Poetry Series.

“I like to hear my poems out 

loud,” Brown wrote in an email 
interview. “It helps me as a writer. 
But even more, the poem is nothing 
until it’s heard. It needs an ear and 
an eye.”

For Brown, nearly anything 

in the world could be her next 
inspiration for a poem. 

“I am inspired by any odd 

thing. Nothing in particular, just 
the ordinaries of my life,” Brown 
wrote. “I am very visual and often a 
poem starts with an image — a tree, 
a cedar waxwing, a man crossing 
the street, etc.”

Brown stressed the importance 

of finding what one is most 
passionate about. In her own life, 
she was unsure of pursuing what 
she loved to do, and encourages 
taking a leap of faith. 

“I had no idea that people could 

do this for a career,” Brown wrote. “I 
got a Ph.D. in American Literature 
and after I began teaching at the 
University of Delaware, I finally put 
together enough poems for a book. 
And behold! Someone wanted to 
publish it. So I was off and running. 
I no longer ‘had’ to be a scholar. I 
could keep doing what gave me the 
most pleasure.”

Brown describes her climb 

to success as many little things 
building up to what she has become 
today.

“Over the years I’ve had some 

great poet friends who’ve read 
my 
poems 
and 
commented, 

encouraged and discouraged me. 

I seem to do best with someone 
pointing 
out 
what’s 
working 

rather than pointing out what isn’t 
working,” Brown wrote. “I do well 
with praise. I’m the one who’s 
hardest on myself.”

In Traverse City, Brown has 

been staying busy with several 
different projects.

“I’ve been working my tail off. 

I put together an edited collection 
of my blog posts from when I 
had cancer and published it as a 
book, ‘My Wobbly 
Bicycle,’ with all 
the proceeds going 
to 
the 
Cowell 

Cancer Center here 
in Traverse City,” 
Brown wrote. “I’m 
writing an essay 
now 
and 
then, 

expecting to pull 
essays together for 
a collection when I 
have enough that I 
like.”

Patricia 
Clark, 

a former poet laureate of Grand 
Rapids from 2005 to 2007, is a 
professor of writing at Grand 
Valley State University. 

Clark will be reading from her 

new book, “The Canopy,” which 
came out in January. She enjoys 
hearing how people respond to 
her work. She may even read a 
new poem that has not yet been 
published. 

“There’s always a surprise in 

terms of what people respond to … 
that’s really fun,” Clark said. “And 
then people come up and say ‘I was 
really moved by this’ or ‘this meant 
a lot to me.’ ”

Clark describes her style of 

poetry as lyrical, and it often 
focuses on aspects of the natural 
environment. 

“Poetry really is closest to music 

in terms of an art form even though 
it is words, so I tend to try to have 
a fairly musical kind of line,” Clark 
said. “And then in terms of imagery 
and stuff like that I have a lot of 
nature imagery in my poems.”

Basing 
her 
writing 
off 

observations, she is known to 
simply walk about and see what 

the eye can see without taking 
any notes. Finding things in the 
physical world inspires her to 
discover what it signifies.

“When I come home, my test 

is kind of, ‘Do I still remember 
something?’ And if I still remember 
something then it must mean 
something psychological,” Clark 
added. “So my goal as a writer is 
to put some words down on paper, 
some observations, and see it I can 
tease out what it means.”

Playing 
with 

language is a large 
part of her writing. 
When the words 
come together just 
right, Clark finds 
her job to be a real 
thrill.

“When 
the 

reader reads it they 
too have a little 
discovery moment 
and a moment of 
insight. Not a big 
moment, like ‘the 

world sucks,’ it’s more like a little 
insight, like this is a beautiful 
moment,” Clark said. “Now that

FILM REVIEW

Tony Conrad, subject of the new documentary
Conrad documentary is a 
heartfelt portrait of artist

New doc profiles the life of experimental filmmaker Tony Conrad

“History 
is 
like 
music, 

completely in the present” – Tony 
Conrad

These are the words that 

open this riveting documentary 
on the life and work of artist, 
musician, filmmaker and teacher 
Tony Conrad, and they couldn’t 
be more accurate. Conrad is 
radically present in all of his 
endeavors, using his passion 
and 
creativity 
to 
challenge 

constructs of power, cinema, 
music and art. The film, directed 
and produced by Tyler Hubby 
(“House of Harrington”), is 
a non-linear style timeline of 
Conrad’s 
experimental, 
anti-

authority, sometimes blinding 
collection of artistic endeavors. 
Hubby 
manages 
to 
capture 

Conrad as an artist and a 
character simultaneously, while 
keeping the audience engaged, 
entertained and excited.

Conrad 
is 
loveable 
and 

ridiculous. His personality is 
clearly demonstrated on screen 
as a quirky grandpa-type who 
talks to the camera as if it were 
a dear friend. Before entering 
the world of minimalist music, 
Conrad 
studied 
computers 

at Harvard, which explains 
his high caliber vocabulary 

and 
long-winded 
soliloquies. 

Following 
Harvard, 
Conrad 

took refuge on Ludlow Street 
in downtown New York City, 
where he jammed with the likes 
of John Cale and The Velvet 
Underground. It was there that 
Conrad and his buds helped form 
the foundation for minimalist 
music as we see it today.

After 
making 
strides 
in 

the music scene, Conrad took 
his talents to the world of 
underground filmmaking, where 
he challenged Andy Warhol 
and cinema in general. Hubby 
documents Conrad’s ventures 
in 
underground 
filmmaking 

with his 1965 debut of “The 
Flicker,” a film which consists of, 
well, flickers. Conrad playfully 
addresses the camera declaring 
himself 
“Mr. 
Flicker.” 
Also 

Hubby 
highlights 
Conrad’s 

famous 
“Yellow 
Movies,” 

which fall somewhere between 
performance art and film, with 
a little expressionism thrown in 
for good measure. A hallmark of 
Conrad’s music is the monotoned 
drone of the worst quality violin 
you can imagine. The sound — 
or noise rather — of it can be 
unbearable at times, but the 
passion Conrad feels for his craft 
makes the headache worth it.

In addition to his radical films 

rooted in challenging the norm, 
Conrad also took on teaching 

media at both Antioch College 
and The State University of 
New York at Buffalo. Conrad 
perfectly fits the mold of the 
oddball professor, with teaching 
methods 
in 
the 
classroom 

that keep students on their 
toes. He skyped into a class 
on documentary filmmaking, 
utilizing Hubby as a teaching 
tool in his instruction. The 
meta-effect perfectly captures 
Conrad’s effervescent presence 
and style.

Conrad, an abstract artist 

in his own right, screws the 
construct of abstract art and 
the contemplative religiously 
that goes with it. Conrad would 
rather make his audience laugh 
out loud than silently meditate, 
and Hubby’s film is definitely 
filled with laughter.

The film ends with Conrad 

standing on the streets of New 
York 
City, 
directing 
traffic 

as if he were conducting an 
orchestra; a screaming child, a 
motorcycle, three large trucks. 
It is the perfect end to the 
documentary, leaving the viewer 
with a final taste of Conrad’s 
eccentric, 
quirky 
charm. 

Hubby’s 
documentary 
is 
a 

telling portrait of Tony Conrad’s 
contributions to the world of art, 
cinema and music, all the while 
capturing the unique lovability 
of a legendary creative mind.

FILM PROFILE
The 55th Ann Arbor Film 
Festival Awards Review

Madeleine Gaudin recaps winners and losers of this year’s festival

This past Sunday, the awards 

ceremony of the 55th Ann Arbor 
Film Festival opened with a 
jab at the festival itself. Before 
the award winning shorts were 
screened, they played what the 
introductory 
remarks 
called 

a “PSA.” It was an SNL skit 
from last fall that poked fun at 
the experimental film festival. 
Within a genre of filmmaking 
that seems ripe for this sort of 
mockery, the films recognized 
on Sunday stood out for their 
simultaneous 
mastery 
of 

narrative and innovative artistic 
expression.

The Ken Burns Award for Best 

of the Festival was awarded to 
“Xylophone,” a collage animation 
piece by Jennifer Levonian. In the 
film, Levonian pairs striking cut-
paper animation with a flowing, 
absurdist plot. With no dialogue, 
the film follows a pregnant 
mother and her daughter as 
they travel across a gentrified 
Philadelphia 
neighborhood 

bouncing on exercise balls in 
“mommy and me” yoga classes 
and picking up goats at the petting 
zoo. “Xylophone” demonstrates 
Levonian’s mastery of animation, 
comedy, social commentary and 
unconventional, yet accessible, 
narrative techniques.

An equally smart animated 

film, “‘The Talk’ True Stories 

About the Birds and the Bees,” 
won the Prix DeVarti Award for 
Funniest Film. Alain Delannoy’s 
short film weaves together the 
first-person testimonials of a 
handful of men who recount 
the talks their parents gave — 
or didn’t give — them about 
sex. From the cringe-worthy 
to the absurd, Delannoy’s film 
captures a very precise moment 
in adolescence with a gentleness 
that allows his subjects to be 
vulnerable. Shown as faceless, 
animated silhouettes, the men 
tell their stories anonymously, a 
trick that allows the film to get as 
close to its subjects as it does in 
its brief 11 minute runtime.

A less traditionally narrative 

piece, “Commodity City,” earned 
its 
creator 
Jessica 
Kingdon 

the award for Most Promising 
Filmmaker. 
Kingdon’s 
film 

explores 
the 
world’s 
largest 

wholesale 
market 
in 
Yiwu, 

China. The mall spans over five 
miles end to end, but Kingdon 
stays close to her subjects, 
favoring detail over scale. She 
captures an assortment of booths 
— 
people 
selling 
everything 

from clocks to rope to flowers. 
At first, the subjects are still and 
quiet, they watch videos on their 
phones and type on computers, 
almost visually consumed by the 
products around them. As we 
settle into the space, the subjects 
begin to behave as if no one is 
watching them. A girl pulls a 
stool out from under her younger 

brother, a boy picks his nose, 
others fight over toys. Without a 
plot or much dialogue, Kingdon 
builds an immensely intricate 
and visually stunning world 
inside the mall.

In addition to the specific 

awards, 
a 
number 
of 
films 

received Jury Awards. A standout 
among the Jury Award winners 
was William Caballero’s “Victor 
& Isolina,” a part claymation, 
part 
animation 
piece 
about 

the relationship between the 
filmmakers’ 
grandparents. 

The narrative is built around 
recordings 
of 
an 
interview 

between Caballero and each 
grandparent, but none of them 
are seen until the films credits. 
Rather, Caballero shoots small 
doll-like figurines and animates 
the content of the interview in 
paper-cut letters onscreen. The 
film stands apart from others 
in the festival for its innovative 
approach to animation and the 
way in which it blurs the lines 
between traditional animation 
and live action.

Other notable wins include 

Gabriel 
Ortega’s 
“Emelina” 

taking home the Tios Award 
for 
Best 
International 
Film, 

the \aut\ Film Award for Best 
LGBTQ Film going to Elegance 
Bratton’s “Walk for Me” and 
Jonathan Rattner picking up the 
Michael Moore Award for Best 
Documentary for his film “The 
Interior.” A full list of winners is

Michigan’s Pro Day exemplifies main 
commitment to grooming NFL talent

Two and a half years ago, Taco 

Charlton and Chris Wormley 
were just rotation players on 
the Michigan football team’s 
defensive line, with only a 
handful of starts between them.

The 
only 
NFL 
Draft 

speculation surrounding either 
of them came from an Instagram 
post from Charlton in November 
2012, a few months before he 
enrolled at the University. The 
photo depicted an empty Draft 
stage and bore the caption, “One 
day in a couple years I’m going to 
walk across this stage and be able 
to tell my momma (I) made it!!”

Now, after two more full 

seasons of football and a coaching 
staff overhaul, both Charlton and 
Wormley — along with as many as 
a dozen of their teammates — are 
poised to hear their names called 
on a similar stage in Philadelphia 
at the end of April, making their 
dream a reality.

Friday afternoon, Charlton, 

Wormley and the rest of the 
draft-eligible Wolverines spoke 
to the media following the team’s 
annual Pro Day at Oosterbaan 
Field House — where they had 
just worked out in front of a large 
contingency of NFL personnel, 
including at least eight head 
coaches — and couldn’t help but 
reflect on how they made it to this 
moment.

Many of them were highly-

touted recruits brought to Ann 
Arbor by former coach Brady 
Hoke, but either played below 
their potential in their early years 
or had a hard time getting on the 
field whatsoever. But thanks 
to more years of seasoning and 
the arrival of new coach Jim 
Harbaugh — and his experienced, 
NFL-savvy coaching staff — 
many of those same recruits now 
find themselves on the cusp of 
playing at the next level.

“I 
think 
maybe 
we 
did 

something right,” Wormley said. 
“We all could have went our 
separate ways when Coach Hoke 
left, but we all stuck together, 
we all pushed through it and 
made the best of it with Coach 
Harbaugh. And obviously, he’s 
done a lot of great things for us. 
I think it’s a combination of us 
putting in the work and sticking 
through it, and having Coach 
Harbaugh on our side as well.”

Harbaugh’s 
focus 
on 

developing players for the next 
level hasn’t been just limited to 
the highest-caliber high school 
talents, either. Defensive tackle 
Ryan Glasgow was a walk-on who 
worked his way into the starting 
lineup and is now a potential 
mid-round 
draft 
pick. 
And 

defensive tackle Matt Godin was 
a three-star recruit who didn’t 
become a permanent fixture on 
the starting line until this season, 
but he had a positive experience 

at the Pro Day and is pursuing an 
NFL career as well.

The sheer depth and quantity 

of talent earning NFL looks 
Friday — especially given the 
state of the program two seasons 
ago — certainly wasn’t lost on 
Glasgow.

“I think it says we’re taking 

a step in the right direction, 
especially with developing guys 
to the pros,” Glasgow said. “We 
were an eight-, nine-, seven- win 
team but only having two, three 
guys at the Pro Day who were 
getting serious looks for a few 
years there. I think it means 
we’re taking a step in the right 
direction 
in 
developing 
pro 

players and not just working out 
college players.”

And Charlton, one of the 

leaders of the defensive line who 
came on late under Harbaugh 
and figures to be one of the 
Wolverines’ highest draft picks, 

thinks that trend will become 
the new norm. With a number 
of assistant coaches with NFL 
backgrounds — including passing 
game coordinator Pep Hamilton, 
offensive 
coordinator 
Tim 

Drevno and defensive line coach 
Greg Mattison — the groundwork 
for a pipeline from Ann Arbor to 
the NFL is clearly visible.

“What 
Coach 
Harbaugh’s 

been able to do and what all the 
coaching staff has been able to 
do is only gonna continue in the 
future,” Charlton said. “We’ve 
got a lot of young guys that are 
gonna be very successful; they’re 
very talented, they’re just very 
young.

“This is the right coaching 

staff to elevate their game and 
basically teach them the right 
way, so I definitely have faith in 
what Michigan has in the future 
going forward. They’re in good 
hands.”

‘M’ eager to advance

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team has smashed 
its single-season win record. 
Formerly 
stuck 
at 
22, 
the 

Wolverines have won 26 games 
already, and their season is not 
over. Yet after racking up four 
wins in the Women’s National 
Invitation 
Tournament, 

Michigan is in the same place it 
has ended its last two seasons. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

In 2015, the Wolverines faced 

UCLA in the semifinal round of 
the WNIT, and lost by just four 
points to the eventual champions. 
The Wolverines were the only Big 
Ten team invited to the WNIT, 
as Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, 
Nebraska, Northwestern, Ohio 
State and Rutgers all earned bids 
to the NCAA Tournament.

Despite 
its 
eighth 
place 

finish in the Big Ten, Michigan 
redeemed its 2014-15 season 
in the WNIT. The Wolverines 
outlasted all of their fellow 
conference teams in postseason 
play except for the Terrapins, 
who made it to the Final Four of 
the NCAA Tournament. After 
a mediocre season, Michigan’s 
third place WNIT finish was an 
impressive accomplishment.

In 2016, the Wolverines’ season 

came to an end after losing 71-62 
in the WNIT semifinal to Florida 
Gulf Coast. Leading up to the 
matchup, Michigan faced tough 
non-conference teams in Wright 
State, Bucknell, San Diego and 
Temple. The Wolverines scored 
over 75 points in each game 
to move on to the penultimate 
round.

Out of seven Big Ten teams 

competing in 2016, Michigan 
made it the furthest of in the 
WNIT, despite finishing seventh 
in the conference. 

This 
season 
is 
different, 

though. Michigan fully expected 
to be selected to the NCAA 
Tournament 
after 
its 
third 

place finish in the Big Ten. The 
Wolverines spent three weeks 

ranked in the top-25 in the nation 
— the first time they earned a 
spot in the coveted rankings 
since 2013 (coincidentally the 
last time they made the NCAA 
Tournament). While winning the 
NCAA Tournament would still 
have been a long shot, it was a 
shock for them not to be chosen 
to compete, especially since two 
teams behind the Wolverines in 
the Big Ten standings made the 
Big Dance.

That’s 
why, 
if 
Michigan 

finishes its season by losing 
to Villanova in the semifinal 
round of the WNIT, it will be a 
disappointment. Led by senior 
guard Siera Thompson, junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty and 
sophomore center Hallie Thome, 
Michigan is better than it was in 
those seasons.

Thompson now holds the 

all-time assists record, Thome 
has the record for best field goal 
percentage in program history 
and Flaherty occupies the top 
spot for points in a single season, 
points per game and field goals 
made. Even without their third-
best scorer, freshman guard 
Kysre Gondrezick — who began 
an “indefinite leave of absence” 
on Mar. 23 — the Wolverines have 
plenty of prolific players.

Winning the WNIT should not 

be out of reach. Yet Michigan has 
been unpredictable this season.

Though the Wolverines have 

momentum after beating four 
consecutive WNIT opponents, 
they 
also 
seemed 
to 
have 

confidence going into the last 
four games of the regular 
season. Michigan lost three of 
those four games, and the losing 
streak carried over into the Big 
Ten Tournament, where it fell 
to Michigan State in the first 
round.

This season is still supposed 

to be different, but only if the 
Wolverines win the WNIT and 
hang a championship banner 
in 
Crisler 
Center. 
Anything 

less would be considered a 
disappointment.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

‘M’ loses its 21-game home win 
streak against No. 3 Ohio State

During the doubles matchup 

between the No. 16 Michigan 
men’s tennis team and No. 3 Ohio 
State, the Varsity Tennis Center 
was anything but quiet. 

The rows on the north side of 

the building were packed as the 
two rival teams battled it out 
for the doubles point. But the 
Wolverines would lose at both 
the No. 1 and No. 2 spots, and 
the Buckeyes (4-0 Big Ten, 19-3 
overall) would gain the initial 
advantage.

The point was one of four Ohio 

State would record en route to 
winning the matchup, 4-1. The 
loss snapped Michigan’s 21-game 
win streak at home, which dates 
back to the 2014-15 season. It 
also snapped the Wolverines’ 
five-game win streak overall.

The No. 1 doubles pair for 

Michigan (1-1, 11-4) consisted 
of senior Jathan Malik and 
freshman 
Connor 
Johnston, 

which rank 30th nationally. This 
was a shift from the norm, as 
Malik usually pairs with senior 
Kevin Wong, and the duo sits at 
No. 5 in the ITA.

“We’ve played 

that lineup a few 
times 
already 

but 
we 
went 

back to it,” said 
Michigan coach 
Adam Steinberg. 
“I thought it was 
a good change, 
we 
needed 
it, 

we’ve 
been 

struggling on the 
doubles court and we just needed 
something, a spark, anything, so 
that’s why we made the change.”

Malik and Johnston jumped 

out to an early 3-0 lead, while the 
No. 2 pair of juniors Runhao Hua 

and Alex Knight fell behind their 
Buckeye counterparts. The No. 
3 duo, consisting of Wong and 
sophomore Myles Schalet, also 
advanced to a lead.

But while the No. 3 pair was 

able to secure a 6-4 win, Knight 

and Hua dropped 
their match, 4-6. 
The winner of 
the doubles point 
boiled down to 
the No. 1 spot.

With 
the 

game tied at 40 
and Ohio State 
leading in sets, 
5-4, 
the 
next 

point 
would 

either 
keep 

Michigan in the running or give 
the Buckeyes possession of the 
doubles point. Ultimately, the 
Wolverine pair sent the ball out 
of bounds, giving Ohio State the 
advantage headed into singles.

At No. 1 singles, Malik faced 

the challenge of playing Buckeye 
Mikael Torpegaard, a junior 
from Denmark who is the top-
ranked singles player in the 
nation.

Malik gained an early edge 

with a 6-3 win in the first set of 
the match. The second set went 
to a tiebreak, which Torpegaard 
claimed 7-6 (5). The two went 
into a third set, only to abandon 
the match after Ohio State 
recorded its fourth team point on 
another court.

“I thought he did great,” 

Steinberg said. “I thought it 
was a big lift for our team, a big 
confidence boost for him and for 
us against the best player in the 
country. I thought he played a 
really smooth match and I told 
him that he should be proud of 
that effort for sure.”

The Wolverines’ lone point 

came from junior Alex Knight at 
the No. 3 spot in straight sets over 
JJ Wolf, 6-3, 7-5. But individual 
victories from Ohio State’s Hugo 
Di Feo, Kyle Seelig and Herkko 
Pollanen at No. 2, No. 4 and No. 5, 
respectively, gave the Buckeyes 
to enough points to claim the 
win.

Wolverines’ energy not enough 
to clinch doubles point Sunday 

Just 10 minutes into the No. 

16 Michigan men’s tennis team’s 
doubles matches, each Wolverine 
doubles pair had the upper hand 
and it appeared that they were 
going to win at least two of the 
three matches and clinch the 
doubles point easily. 

But No. 3 Ohio State would not 

go down without a fight.

Michigan made a point to 

come out with more intensity 
than it had all season, and the 
energy from a packed crowd 
in the Varsity Tennis Center 
seemed to be propelling the 
Wolverines to a victory.

“Every second of every day 

is about playing for Michigan, 
playing for each other, playing 
for 
something 
bigger 
than 

themselves, with better energy, 
better 
enthusiasm,” 
said 

Michigan coach Adam Steinberg.

But that kind of fervor couldn’t 

last forever.

The No. 1 doubles pair of senior 

Jathan Malik and freshman 
Connor Johnston jumped out 
to an early 3-0 lead, but the 
Buckeyes rallied and after a 
double fault from Johnston, they 
held a narrow 4-3 lead. 

With a strong performance 

at No. 3 doubles, senior Kevin 
Wong and sophomore Myles 
Schalet claimed a 6-4 victory. In 
the match point, the duo served 
to its opponent’s backhand and 
he mishit the ball off the frame, 
ending the match.

The No. 2 duo finished almost 

simultaneously, though with a 
different result. The pair lost 
its early lead and fell to the 
Buckeyes, 6-4.

With each team having won 

one match, Malik and Johnston 
were left to give their team 
the doubles point – and the 
advantage – going into singles 
play.

With the score tied at four 

games apiece, Ohio State was up 

40-0 and only one point away 
from breaking the Wolverines’ 
serve. Malik and Johnston battled 
back to deuce but ultimately 
fell short after 
the 
Buckeyes 

watched Malik’s 
shot 
sail 
just 

long 
of 
the 

baseline.

Ohio 
State 

was up 5-4 and 
serving for the 
match.

It 
was 

a 
tightly-

contested game, 
reaching deuce once again. The 
Buckeyes served to Malik, giving 
him the opportunity to redeem 
himself. He set his feet in an 
attempt to hit a deep shot down 
the line, but once again the ball 

landed outside of the court.

“We got up on them a little 

bit and they really fought hard 
and stayed in there,” Steinberg 

said. “I thought 
we 
could 
have 

put them away, 
especially at one 
doubles. 
It 
got 

away from us a 
little bit, but I 
was happy with 
the energy and 
the 
way 
they 

competed.”

Michigan’s 

momentum 

from the start of the match had 
transferred to Ohio State. The 
Buckeyes ran away with the 
doubles point, which then set the 
tone for the rest of the match, 
which Ohio State won, 4-1.

Canfield powers Michigan on offense, defense

Faith Canfield spent Friday 

morning in class jotting down 
notes instead of taking batting 
practice 
before 
the 
No. 
19 

Michigan softball team opened 
Big Ten play against Penn State. 

This 
lack 
of 
game-time 

preparation didn’t matter for 
the sophomore second baseman. 
While her teammates rocketed 
balls over the fence during 
warmups, Canfield was one of few 
who consistently found success 
when it counted.

The 
Garden 
Grove, 
Calif., 

native hit a combined 6-for-9 
this weekend against the Nittany 
Lions, racking up six RBI, five 
runs and five extra-base hits — 
including three doubles, a triple 
and her team-leading fifth home 
run of the season. Canfield’s bat 
was hot throughout the Penn State 
series, offsetting the Wolverines’ 
unpredictable production at the 
plate.

Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins believes Canfield has 
given the underwhelming lineup 
a much-needed spark when the 
Wolverines have needed it most.

“Faith has been just working 

hard and improving,” Hutchins 
said. “I think she plays with a 
great energy, which I think helps 
you play better. … She has great 
rhythm and is swinging well. So, 
she is making it look kind of easy. 
I’d like to think that that inspires 
the group — that ‘You can do it, if 
I can do it.’

“She’s certainly been solid 

for us,” she concluded while 
grinning.

With the graduation of one 

of Michigan’s all-time greats, 
Sierra Romero, Canfield won the 
starting job at second base. And 
the decision to insert her in the 
lineup is paying dividends in both 
aspects of the game.

Canfield boasts a .359 batting 

average, and leads the team in 
home runs with five, 59 total 
bases and 29 runs. She also 
ranks among the top three on the 

team in doubles, RBI, steals and 
slugging percentage.

Coming into college, Canfield 

was a go-to utility player and 
an undeveloped power hitter, 
looking instead to make contact 
and get on base. But hard work to 
get “bigger” during the offseason 
has led to the sophomore already 
doubling her home run total from 
last year.

Canfield also attributes her 

newfound power to the fine-
tuning of her technique in the 
batter’s box and hitting off her 
backside. Then there’s the mental 
aspect to her approach, one 
Hutchins engrains into all her 
players. She purely focuses on the 
outcome of each at-bat by hitting 
the back of the ball, or at least 
making contact to put it into play.

“It’s in my confidence, trusting 

my process and just keeping it 
simple,” Canfield said. “Honestly, 
not making it too big. The game 
doesn’t know who you’re playing 
or what your batting average is, 
so you just have to go up to every 
at-bat looking to hit the ball hard.”

Though Canfield made her 

name known last year after 
flashing 
offensive 
potential, 

primarily 
entering 
games 
as 

the designated player, she has 
earned a reputation this year as a 
reliable defensive player¬¬. This 
weekend, her sometimes flashy — 
but always consistent — glove got 
her pitchers out of jams, inspiring 
her teammates in the process. She 
has posted a perfect 1.000 fielding 
percentage this season and leads 
the team with 45 assists, along 
with 28 putouts.

Canfield believes her backup 

role for most of last season taught 
her to be more appreciative of all 
the chances she gets to display her 
natural fielding abilities.

“I love going out there,” 

Canfield said. “… I think just going 
out there and enjoying it and 
realizing that every day we get 
to play is a great opportunity (is 
important). I think that whether 
you’re up or down, being grateful 
definitely helps me keep a positive 
energy.”

For her teammates, watching 

Canfield’s prowess and dedication 
to the game is motivational, 

impacting their own play.

“She’s improved so much from 

last year and I’m so proud of her 
because of her work ethic and 
honestly, how hard she goes for 
this sport,” said junior designated 
player Amanda Vargas.

Added 
senior 
right-hander 

Megan Betsa: “She comes every 
day, she works hard and she has 
great at-bats. I know throwing to 
her in practice, it’s always a tough 
battle, so I think she gives us life 
and she gives us the spark that we 
need, especially in the two-hole.”

With a dominant weekend 

showing, 
Canfield 
solidified 

herself as a major force on a 
shockingly subdued Wolverine 
offense this season, and is primed 
to catalyze Michigan in upcoming 
Big Ten play.

“At batting practice today, we 

hit about 100 balls over the fence, 
and apparently we used them all 
up,” Hutchins said after Friday’s 
“fortunate” 3-0 win. “We only 
had six well-hit balls and Faith 
had three of them. And she wasn’t 
even at batting practice today.”

But imagine if she was.

SOFTBALL
Scoring first equals 
playing loose for ‘M’

Jogging off the field after 

escaping a second-inning jam 
against Penn State last Friday, 
junior right-hander Tera Blanco 
was met by an enraged Michigan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins. 
As 

Hutchins’ voice boomed toward 
Blanco, echoing around Alumni 
Field, the game’s urgency grew. 
The Wolverines were stuck in 
a scoreless contest against a 
program that they had beaten in 
their last 25 tries. 

It was obvious Hutchins’ team 

wasn’t playing to her standards. 
She yelled at her hitters to be 
more aggressive at the plate from 
the third base coach’s box, using 
demonstrative swings and hand 
motions to illustrate her point.

Despite Hutchins’ animated 

reaction, Michigan didn’t raise 
its level of play. In a game left 
scoreless until the fifth inning, 
the Wolverines were unable to get 
timely hits until errors and walks 
by Penn State eventually gave the 
game away.

Those first four innings of 

scoreless softball have largely 
represented what the Wolverines’ 
season has been thus far: playing 
tensely but not particularly well 
at times, despite posting a 22-7-1 
record. In more high-pressured 
games against ranked opponents, 
Michigan is just 2-6-1.

“I think when the kids feel 

the pressure, they try too hard,” 
Hutchins said during the Judi 
Garman Classic in early March. 
“That’s exactly what is going on 
with them.”

On Friday — though not against 

a nationally ranked team — the 
Wolverines certainly felt the 
pressure, causing a lackluster start 
to a series though they ultimately 
won the game, 3-0.

But there’s a remedy for that 

tightness: getting on the board 
first. That’s what Michigan did 

against those same Nittany Lions 
on Sunday, pushing across five 
runs in the opening frame and 
winning 17-0 behind a no-hitter 
from senior right-hander Megan 
Betsa.

The 
Wolverines 
enjoyed 

themselves, leaving the field with 
smiles and giving high-fives to 
each other while vocal support 
came from the dugout.

Hutchins believes that these 

three aspects — early leads, 
scoring first, and playing loose — 
are all interconnected.

“Certainly in a game like that 

when you jump on them and you’re 
up by five, you don’t feel tight,” 
Hutchins said. “When you’re not 
tight, you do play better.”

Opening the scoring could be 

Achilles’ Heel for her team.

When Michigan scores first, 

it has a 22-1 record this season. 
When 
the 
Wolverines 
don’t, 

they’re a meager 2-5-1.

Of course, the first team to 

cross home plate maintains the 
innate benefit of purely scoring 
a run. But in Michigan’s case, 
scoring first aids the team’s ability 
to stay relaxed.

“Once we were ahead, we got 

a lot of good swings,” Hutchins 
said. 
“We 
weren’t 
as 
tight. 

Especially when you’re up in the 
series, they’re just trying to get a 
game from you. (Scoring in the 
first inning) puts a stake in it. 
You could feel that Penn State 
was pretty deflated after the first 
inning.”

And as her team poured it 

on the Nittany Lions on Sunday 
afternoon, Hutchins’ face became 
more relaxed from that third 
base line. She wasn’t aggressively 
swinging her hands or shouting at 
players with the same ferocity as 
she did Friday.

That’s because it proved to be 

no longer necessary. Thanks to an 
early lead, the Wolverines — for 
one of the few times this season — 
simply played loosely.

Butt tackles pay for play debate

Jake Butt tore his ACL during 

his last Michigan football game 
against Florida State on Dec. 31, 
risking millions of future signing 
dollars to help his team attempt to 
win the Orange Bowl. But instead 
of discussing whether he should 
have skipped the game to stave 
off injury when questioned at 
Michigan’s Pro Day, he changed 
the conversation to something 
that mattered more — NCAA 
policies.

“I should be the example of 

why college athletes should be 
getting paid in college,” Butt said.

While Butt has commented 

on his issues with the NCAA in 
the past (especially on Twitter), 
he used his platform at Pro 
Day to raise new awareness to 
his concerns. He believes that 
athletes who are bringing in 
huge amounts of revenue for 
their 
universities 
should 
be 

compensated for their efforts.

“When it first hit me was when 

I was getting $900 a month and 
my rent was 700 bucks,” Butt 
said. “I see my name being used 
to profit someone else, and I got 
$200 for food, gas, cable, water.”

As 
he 
alluded 
to, 
Butt’s 

scholarship was hardly enough 
to cover basic living expenses: 
his $700 rent didn’t even cover 
utilities. With a full course load 
and an intense practice schedule, 
there was no way to get a job, so 
Butt was left with only one option.

“I had to call my dad,” Butt 

said. “And thankfully I’m lucky, 
my dad was able to help me out 
a little bit, but there’s plenty of 
people that don’t have families 
that can send them a couple bucks 
to help them cover everything 
else.”

Butt admits that his situation 

wasn’t nearly as bad as it could 
get.

“Some people can’t call their 

parents,” Butt said. “Some people 
are sending their money home to 
their parents.

“There’s one example last year 

of a guy, someone was giving 
him money — his family money 
— because his mom can’t pay the 
bills,” Butt said. “A millionaire 

guy is giving his mom a couple 
hundred bucks a month to help 
her pay her bills. When this guy is 
sacrificing his body… I don’t see a 
problem with that.”

One of the issues, according 

to Butt, is that his likeness can 
be used without his consent, and 
profited off of hugely. Meanwhile 
he is still forced to look for 
funds elsewhere, though other 
people are making a indefinite 
amounts of money off of his 
name, face and signature. He has 
even seen people wearing shirts 
emblazoned with “I like Jake Butt 
and I cannot lie.”

The ability to profit off Butt 

is not limited to the NCAA, 
though. Anyone on the street can 
sell his signature too, but Butt 
can’t use his own name for any 
special benefits — not even a free 
breakfast.

“I see those mini helmets going 

for like 340 bucks with like me 
and Jabrill’s signatures on Ebay,” 
Butt said. “There’s something 
not adding up here. ‘They’re 
protecting us.’ They at least 
should come up with something 
better. They’re not protecting us.”

He would like athletes to be 

compensated 
somehow, 
and 

while he repeated that he didn’t 
need a paycheck, it seems that 
education isn’t always enough.

“I’m 
grateful. 
(I 
had 
a) 

wonderful education here at 
Michigan,” Butt said. “But there’s 
something missing here. …I’m 
looking at how much money this 
March Madness is bringing in 
… oh, but the basketball players 
get an education? How are they 
getting an education if they’re 
missing the whole entire month 
of March?”

According to him, Butt doesn’t 

plan on giving up his cause after 
he starts his career in the NFL. 
He will keep speaking out and 
advocating for the rights of 
student athletes. And while Butt 
hasn’t come up with a concrete fix 
for the issues he’s raised, several 
suggestions were thrown out.

“What would happen if we 

didn’t play? Damn,” Butt said. 
“Think about how much money 
the NCAA is losing if we didn’t 
play.

“I 
think 
these 
kind 
of 

conversations 
are 
important. 

Someday, something needs to 
change.”

Wolverines prep for midweek tilts

The Michigan baseball team (1-2 

Big Ten, 17-6 overall) opened up 
conference play at Maryland last 
weekend, but it will now return 
to Ray Fisher Stadium to host two 
non-conference midweek contests.

The Wolverines will face Toledo 

(0-3 Mid-American Conference, 
5-18 overall), which is fresh off a 
weekend series against Northern 
Illinois, on Tuesday. Michigan 
played the Huskies two weekends 
ago.

The Rockets lost all three games 

to the Northern Illinois, with the 
Huskies outscoring Toledo 32-9.

When Northern Illinois and the 

Wolverines battled in Ann Arbor, 
Michigan took two out of the three 
games due to an offensive surge 
by junior third baseman Drew 
Lugbauer – including a walk-off 
home run and a grand slam.

The 
Rockets’ 
most 
prolific 

threat on offense is outfielder AJ 
Montoya who currently sports a 

.291 batting average and leads his 
team in runs batted-in with 17. 
Toledo currently has zero players 
batting over .300, while Michigan 
has three players over that mark 
in — redshirt sophomore left fielder 
Miles Lewis, sophomore second 
baseman Ako Thomas and senior 
shortstop Michael Brdar.

When the Wolverines host 

Central 
Michigan 
(10-13) 
on 

Wednesday, though, the task will 
be much tougher. The Chippewas 
recently earned two wins against 
Missouri State, but have posted 
mixed results this season against 
other Big Ten opponents. 

Central 
Michigan 
took 

three out of four games against 
Northwestern, but then fell 11-2 to 
Michigan State just two days later.

Midweek contests may prove 

difficult for Michigan since the 
Wolverines may not receive regular 
rest, but the Chippewas have a deep 
lineup — with every player seeing 
the field so far this season — and 
just two have started and played in 
every game.

Infielder 
Alex 
Borglin 
and 

outfielder Daniel Robinson have 
started in all 23 games this season. 
They have combined for 37 RBI 
so far and are boasting a .351 and 
.327 batting average, respectively. 
Michigan has made a habit of 
starting off slow and with the 
pair batting high in the order, the 
Wolverines will need to ready from 
the first pitch.

These midweek matchups also 

mean that all of the teams will be 
without their usual starters on the 
mound. Junior right-hander Jayce 
Vancena will most likely pitch 
for Michigan after a stellar start 
during the Wolverines’ previous 
midweek game against Western 
Michigan.

But the Wolverines can expect 

to see a lot of fresh faces on the 
hill, such as freshman right-hander 
Karl Kauffman and sophomore 
left-hander William Tribucher.

Two midweek game victories 

may give Michigan confidence 
before its Big Ten home opener this 
weekend.
