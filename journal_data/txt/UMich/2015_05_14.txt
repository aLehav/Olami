Michigan 
wins first Big 
Ten tourney 
since 2006 

Third-ranked 

Wolverines will host 
Regional Tournament 

beginning Friday

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

COLUMBUS — For the first time 

in the Big Ten tournament, the Wol-
verines found themselves as the 
away team despite boasting the top 
seed. The stadium was usually the 
home to Ohio State, covered in scar-
let and gray. But on Saturday night, it 
couldn’t have felt more like home. The 
Michigan fan base came in bunches, 
occupying more than half of the seats, 
as the team led the crowd in Hail to 
the Victors before the first pitch.

To the surprise of many fans, 

senior left-hander Haylie Wagner 
got the start in the circle. The other 
pitcher on the Michigan staff, Megan 
Betsa, was dominant all weekend, 
only allowing one run over the first 
two games of the tournament.

Things were different Saturday 

night, but for the No.3 Michigan soft-
ball team, the result was the same as it 
had been all weekend.

Wagner proved why she earned 

the start in the Big Ten Champion-
ship final, leading her team to a 6-1 
win over the Cornhuskers (17-6 Big 
Ten, 34-21 overall). With the victory, 
the Wolverines (21-2, 51-6) hoisted 
their first Big Ten Tournament trophy 
since 2006.

It was also the sixth time that they 

have earned both the Big Ten regular 
season and tournament title, the first 
since 2005, when it won an NCAA 
Championship as well.

“I’m really proud of my kids,” said 

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. “I’m 
really pleased with our approach and 
our togetherness … We had great 

Dark matter recreated in

For the Daily

An installation in the Media 

Union of the Duderstadt Cen-
ter allows visitors to experience 
something often discussed in 
science fiction novels. Jeweled 
Net of the Vast Invisible: An 
Experience of Dark Matter — 
which officially opened Wednes-
day and is open until Friday 
— offers the public the opportu-
nity to witness something that is 
otherwise invisible to the naked 
eye: dark matter.

A team of researchers and 

graduate students projected a 
computer simulation of data 
from billions of particles in our 
universe onto a 20-foot-high, 
140-degree panoramic screen. 
Attendees are immersed in “jew-
eled spaces” of particles and 
matter that displays how the 

world would have looked follow-
ing the Big Bang. Dark matter is 
simulated from billions of data 
regarding our solar system.

The MCubed seed grant pro-

gram, funding programs con-
sisting of faculty in a variety of 
disciplines, sponsored the event.

Physics Prof. Gregory Tarlé, 

who conceptualized the project, 
said the idea for the installation 
came from his desire to make the 
beauty behind his research of 
cosmology, the scientific study of 
the development of the universe, 
more accessible.

“When I do my research in 

cosmology, I see all sorts of very 
beautiful things,” Tarlé said. 
“But these things are buried in 
data and equations and things 
that are not accessible to the 
general public. And so I thought 
that it might be possible, through 
art, to reveal this kind of beauty 
that’s in the universe to people 
who are not cosmologists.”

Tarlé collaborated with both 

Art & Design Prof. Jim Cogswell 
and Stephen Rush, professor of 
performing arts technology, to 

create a visual simulation for the 
University community to experi-
ence. The project team also hired 
University alum Jason Eaton, 
who graduated with a degree 
in computer science, to work on 
computer visualizations.

“We just started brainstorm-

ing, coming up with ideas about 
how to visualize that which is 
invisible ...the dark matter of 
the universe — the cosmic web 
which forms the structure into 
which the stars, galaxies...” 
Tarlé said.

In a preview Tuesday, a live 

jazz band from the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance accom-
panied the visualizations. The 
melody of jazz constantly shifted 
from ominous to celebratory, 
varying based on the scenes of 
the simulated universe. As the 
lights travelled more quickly, the 
harmony quickened, providing 
the sensation of actual flight.

Tarlé said having music incor-

porated in the presentation of 
dark matter was essential to the 
project.

Resort to file suits 
against Greek life 
members on ski trip

Findings of additional 
investigations suggest 
further legal actions are 
necessary, Treetops says

By CARLY NOAH

Summer News Editor

Tuesday 
afternoon, 
Treetops 
Resort announced it will file a civil 
lawsuit against individual members 
of the Sigma Delta Tau sorority and 
former members of the University’s 
disbanded chapter of Sigma Alpha 
Mu fraternity for damages during 
their ski trip the weekend of Jan. 19.
More than 200 members of Sigma 
Alpha Mu, along with members of 
Sigma Delta Tau, were present at 
the Northern Michigan ski resort 
that weekend. Following the trip, 
the SAM chapter was disbanded due 
to allegedly costing the resort more 
than $430,000 in damages, and the 
SDT chapter was placed on a two-
year disciplinary suspension for 
their failure to intervene.

SDT recently launched a bystand-
er intervention program centered 
around providing students with the 
tools necessary to intervene in diffi-
cult situations.
Treetops spokeswoman Susan 
Wilcox-Olsen confirmed to the 
Detroit Free Press the resort plans 
to sue several fraternity and sorority 
members.
Barry Owens, general manager of 
Treetops, could not be reached for 
comments about the specific num-
ber of fraternity and sorority mem-
bers the resort plans to sue.
“Treetops’ legal advisors have 
recently completed a review of the 
facts of the case, including recently 
released material prepared pursu-
ant to the criminal investigation,” 
the resort said in a press release. 
“Criminal 
charges 
were 
filed 
against three students last month. 
Several facts from this review now 
suggest that legal action beyond the 
criminal matter should be pursued.”
The resort also said the resort’s 
management confronted the group 
of students involved after the first

Faculty, students 
discuss diversity 
of Great Books 

Current classes only 
study Greek and 
Biblical literature

By RACHEL PREMACK

Daily Saff Reporter

As students challenge the 
status quo of academic require-
ments at the University, one LSA 
Honors Program requirement is 
hardly unchanged since the pro-
gram’s founding in 1947.
Freshmen in the Honors Pro-
gram were, up until Fall 2014, 
required to take Great Books. 
Although that requirement has 
since altered slightly, Great 
Books remains one of the few 
options, and, at about 200 stu-
dents, it remains the most popu-
lar Honors course, according 
to History Prof. Sara Forsdyke, 
director of the Interdepart-
mental Program in Greek and 
Roman History. The reading 
list for the class is composed of 
Greco-Roman 
literature 
and 
excerpts from the Bible.
One Honors newsletter from 
2007, the 50th anniversary of 
the Honors Program, notes, 
“The founders of Honors wanted 
a course that would allow stu-
dents to immerse themselves in 
the study of a significant culture, 
and classical Greece seemed the 
obvious choice.”
However, 
some 
scholars 
say this choice shouldn’t be so 
instinctive, especially as the 
University pledges to prepare 
its students for an increasingly 
global society.
Microcosm of an ongoing 
debate
Debates on increasing the 
diversity of university’s curricu-
la grew in the early 1990s, when 
the term “dead white European 
male” was coined. Students and 
scholars alike began to ques-
tion why their social science and 
humanities courses contained 

only the experiences of white 
men from bygone eras. These 
activists wanted to amplify the 
voices of women and those out-
side white European and Ameri-
can heritage.
Critics of that movement 
claimed that Greco-Roman lit-
erature retained its significance. 
They praised the Greeks’ inno-
vations in areas such as politics, 
science and rhetoric, some-
times with a tinge of annoyance 
toward what they perceived to 
be political correctness.
Few 
elite 
schools 
today 
require Great Books courses, 
which were developed at Colum-
bia University and the Univer-
sity of Chicago in the 1920s. At 
Chicago, Greek Thought and 
Literature remains one of the 
eight options for undergraduate 
students to fulfill the requisite 
humanities 
course 
sequence. 
But world literature and open-
ended topics such as “Language 
and the Human” are also appli-
cable.
The University of Notre Dame 
has a more traditional Great 
Books course for students in its 
Program of Liberal Studies. Save 
for readings from Confucius, 
Bhagavad Gita and Black Ameri-
can author Ralph Ellison, the 
sequence is dominated by Euro-
pean perspectives.
But Notre Dame’s Liberal 
Studies program professes a 
much different task than our 
diversity-focused University: it 
is “anchored in the Western and 
Catholic traditions,” according 
to their website. The LSA Hon-
ors Program, on the other hand, 
pictures itself a “vibrant com-
munity,” emphasizing inclusion: 
“There’s something for everyone 
and all are invited.”
Why are these books so 
great, anyway?
While Great Books courses 
occasionally include upper-level 
courses on contemporary Euro-

U.S. News journalist talks book, reporting 

White House 
reporter highlighted 
how pop culture 
affects the presidency

By ALAINA WYGANT

Daily Staff Reporter

May 7, Kenneth Walsh, a White 
House correspondent for U.S. News & 
World Report, spoke at the Gerald R. 
Ford Presidential Library and Museum 
about his book “Celebrity in Chief: A 
History of the Presidents and Culture 
of Stardom.”

Walsh has written from the White 
House during the tenure of five differ-
ent presidents — most recently, Presi-
dent Barack Obama. His blog, “Ken 
Walsh’s Washington,” and column, The 
Presidency, provide coverage of the the 
president.
At the event, Ford Museum Direc-
tor Elaine Didier praised Walsh for his 
unique style of reporting.
“Ken’s colleagues say that he is an 
old school journalist who knows how 
to find secrets, and then knows which 
ones can be told and which ones must 
be kept longer or even forever,” Didier 
said.
In his book “Celebrity in Chief,” 
Walsh examined how past presidents 

have interacted with American popu-
lar culture. During his remarks at the 
event, Walsh discussed how he believed 
President George Washington was a 
pillar in molding the role of president.
“His feeling was that the president 
should be accessible,” Walsh said. “He 
set that precedent that the president 
should not be beyond the public.”
Walsh also highlighted some of the 
key moments reporters have witnessed 
in the White House over the past cen-
tury including Elvis Presley’s visit to the 
White House during the Nixon admin-
istration and Marilyn Monroe’s birth-
day performance for President John F. 
Kennedy.
Walsh said the American public 

often correlates presidential success 
with celebrity status instead of consid-
ering the substance — such as policy 
making and managing foreign and 
domestic affairs — that defines the 
presidency.
“That’s all people want is a little taste 
of the substance because they don’t 
have the patience to learn much more 
about things,” Walsh said. “Sadly, I 
think that’s true.”
Walsh said President Obama tries 
to connect with audiences on a deeper 
level by going on talk shows such as 
“Jimmy Kimmel Live” and the You-
Tube show “Between Two Ferns with 
Zach Galifianakis.” He said these are 
behaviors that future presidents will 

need to mimic.
“President Obama is trying to reach 
out to people through those different 
venues and find ways to communicate 
with them,” Walsh said. “I think this is 
what presidents are going to have to do 
for the foreseeable future. They’ve got 
to go where the voters are and where 
they’re paying attention.”
Overall, Walsh said he believes peo-
ple will be less isolated from political 
affairs if they engage with politics more.
“Maybe people would get angry and 
start fighting each other if they engaged 
more. But they don’t,” Walsh said. “And 
so, that’s one of the reasons we’re so 
polarized — it’s because we’re not talk-
ing to each other.”

“The music kind of created a 
sense that there was something 
going on, and brought you through 
those parts of the visualization 
where things are fairly uniform, 
and gave a sense that something 
was about to happen,” Tarlé said. 
“When things started to happen, 
the music tied it all together and 

gave audio cues to what you were 
seeing.”
Tarlé said in the future he would 
like to see this project displayed in 
a museum.
“I would like to take this to a 
museum somewhere and get it put 
it up as an installation...I think that 
would be a very good way to carry 
this forward,” Tarlé said.
As for Tuesday’s viewing audi-
ence, Tarlé said his favorite part 
was watching the reactions of the 

younger attendees.
“There were a bunch of little 
kids that were watching this just 
getting really excited … I loved 
their reaction,” Tarlé said. They’re 
just looking at the thing and getting 
captured by it. It shows that science 
can be presented to people of all 
ages if you do it right.”

night of their stay.
“During that meeting, manage-
ment pointed out that the student 
group had not completed their pre-
payment arrangement as is typical 
for larger groups and that the addi-
tional money was due,” the resort 
said. “Treetops’ management had 
also discovered significant, but 
non-malicious damage occurred 
after this first night and discussed 
the University of Michigan’s stu-
dents’ behavior with their leader-
ship.
In a statement to the Daily, 
Sigma Delta Tau’s national chap-

ter said the sorority was unaware 
of any pending lawsuits from the 
resort, and still maintain the find-
ings of their previous investiga-
tions.
“We are not aware of any liti-
gation involving the Chi Chapter 
of Sigma Delta Tau at the Univer-
sity of Michigan or its women,” 
the sorority wrote. “Through our 
investigation, we have found the 
women were not responsible for 
the damage incurred at Treetops 
Resort. We have also been made 
aware of multiple reports that 
management and security guards 
of The Treetops Resort and Spa 
did not step in to stop any of the 
actions while they occurred that 
weekend.“

In their statement, the resort 
said the lack of action against indi-
viduals contributed to their deci-
sion to pursue its own legal action 
was the lack of cooperation by the 
Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity.
“Contributing to the decision to 
pursue its own legal action is the 
fact that to date, only three stu-
dents are being charged and Tree-
tops is not aware of the University 
of Michigan or the Greek organi-
zations taking any other action 
against any individuals,” the resort 
said. “Apparently, authorities have 
been impeded by the refusal of 
the students to identify those spe-
cifically involved in the vandalism 
further suggesting that the dam-
age was a group effort.”

Otsego prosecutor Michael Rola 
issued 30-day misdemeanor charg-
es against Business sophomores 
Joshua Kaplan and Zachary Levin. 
The pair turned themselves in to 
the Ann Arbor Police Department 
on March 25. Matthew Vlasic, 

who was an LSA senior at the time 
of the ski trip, was arraignedon 
charges of malicious destruction of 
property.

FROM THE DAILY

Give us some credit

Fair Student Credit Act would help defaulting students
W

hile speaking at Michigan State University on Monday, 
Sen. Gary Peters (D–Mich.) presented the details of the 
proposed Fair Student Credit Act, a bipartisan collabora-

tion between Peters and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R–W.Va.). The pro-
posed legislation is an attempt to help students regain good financial 
standing and avoid the pitfalls of student loan default and was initially 
introduced to the House in 2013. Applying a similar credit rehabilita-
tion procedure to that of federal loans, the bill provides students with 
the beneficial opportunity to repair their credit after defaulting on pri-
vate student loans, as long as borrowers follow a schedule of nine con-
secutive payments. By doing so, the Fair Student Credit Act eliminates 
some discrepancies between public and private loans. The legislation 
intends to ensure students who needed to rely on these loans to finance 
their education will not face long-term credit damage because of con-
tinued financial difficulties after graduation and should be passed. 
However, the bill should be more comprehensive in order to be more 
beneficial to students.

For students coming from 

lower 
socioeconomic 
back-

grounds, the exorbitant costs 
that come with obtaining a 
college education often make 
taking out a private loan a 
necessity rather than an option. 
In the past 30 years, the average 
published price of in-state col-
lege tuition and fees for public 
universities has risen by 225 
percent adjusted for inflation, 
which could account for the 
prevalence of private student 
loans today. About one-fifth 
of debt from graduates of the 
class of 2012 was from private 
loans, and a good number of stu-
dents have had difficulty pay-
ing these loans. Approximately 
850,000 private student loans 

are in default — according to the 
Consumer Financial Bureau — 
constituting a sum of roughly 
$8 billion in debt. Even after 
obtaining a degree and incur-
ring debt, the current economic 
conditions may inhibit gradu-
ates’ ability to maintain, or even 
start, repaying the loans they 
accrued. Washtenaw County 
boasts some of the highest 
wages in the state, but overall, 
workers in Michigan earn less 
than the national average on 
their weekly paychecks. This 
could make it difficult for gradu-
ates working lower-income jobs 
while searching for a position in 
their desired field to pay back 
 

their loans. 

During his announcement, 

Peters stated, “It’s simply 
unfair to deny some graduates 
the ability to get their finances 
back on track after a default 
simply because their loans 
are private instead of pub-
lic.” Currently, discrepancies 
between federal and private 
loans may worsen the situ-
ation financially struggling 
graduates 
find 
themselves 

in if they do default. Private 
loans, unlike federal loans, 
don’t have fixed interest rates. 
These variable interest rates 
— ranging from roughly 3 to 
12 percent, depending on the 
lender — fluctuate throughout 
the period, which can increase 
the overall amount due at 
the end of students’ college 

O

n May 2, I sat in the bleach-
ers at the Big House as the 
blazing sun transformed my 

exposed 
arms, 

chest, 
face 
and 

scalp into a shade 
of 
bright 
pink. 

My eyes squinted 
against the solar 
glare, 
transfixed 

on the field for 
the Class of 2015’s 
commencement 
ceremony 
from 

the University of 
Michigan. Memo-
ries evoked emotions while speakers 
recalled some of the amazing accom-
plishments I had witnessed first-hand 
from the people I entered college with.

When I left my hometown — a vil-

lage of about 800 people — four years 
ago, I was sure I would be among that 
sea of caps and gowns, smiling with 
friends as we took the last step of our 
undergraduate career.

But I wasn’t.
I was among the anonymous crowd 

of family and friends, befuddled over 
how quickly four years had passed. 
We experienced the beginning of col-
lege together and are connected by 
the freedom we felt freshman year; 
we stumbled through dorms, tests and 
relationships, somehow starting to 
find ourselves. Yet, I often felt stunted 
in my journey, one step behind the 
people around me. I was blindly navi-
gating my way through college, unable 
to fully comprehend what I was there 
for and how I would be able to stay.

Most students enter the University 

with the belief that they will finish 

their undergraduate career in a mere 
four years. With a four-year gradua-
tion rate of about 76 percent, most stu-
dents do. However, halfway through 
my junior year, I realized the four-
year college experience wasn’t the 
path my life was destined to take (or 
able to given the circumstances).

When I first came to the University 

in the fall of 2011, my mom and dad, 
though separated, were technically 
married and made a combined salary 
around $100,000. Though they had a 
solid gross annual income on my first 
Free Application for Federal Student 
Aid, there was never any way for them 
to afford my college education.

My parents — saddled with debt 

and mental illness, which often con-
tributed to substance abuse — were 
financially unstable throughout most 
parts of my life. They were continu-
ously employed, but after the first few 
years of the new millennium, there 
was barely even enough money to 
cover the bills.

I was a pre-teen in a rural village 

worried about my family; I didn’t 
think about college or its costs seri-
ously. It’s also hard to plan for college 
when you’re the only one in the family 
to attend it. 

According to the FAFSA, my par-

ents were expected to pay thousands 
of dollars for my education. Luckily, I 
received a four-year scholarship that 
covered part of my tuition, with fed-
eral loans nearly covering the rest. 
Still, each of the eight semesters I’ve 
spent here, I’ve owed thousands of 
dollars to the University. Every time, 
we paid the money far past the begin-
ning of the semester deadline, most of

careers. Private loans don’t regularly 
offer deferments or forbearance plans 
if students are experiencing issues 
finding employment or if their income 
is insufficient to maintain payments. 
Furthermore, private loan borrow-
ers are at even more of a disadvantage 
due to the shorter period in which an 
inability to pay can lead to default. 
Unlike federal loans, which go into 
default after 270 days of no payment, 
private loans are deemed in default 
after being unpaid for 120 days. 

These discrepancies between private 

and federal student loans, beyond cred-
it rehabilitation, need to be addressed. 
To make college more accessible, all 
types of student loans should work to 
help and accommodate students, not 
hurt them. The Fair Student Credit 
Act should be more encompassing 
in addressing these inconsistencies 
between private and federal loans. 
Even in terms of credit rehabilitation, 

the legislation doesn’t fully solve the 
issue. As it stands, the bill wouldn’t 
mandate that private banks comply, so 
there would be no guarantee that the 
default would be erased from a bor-
rower’s credit history. This could mean 
that, even if the bill passes, many banks 
will continue to damage students’ 
futures over financial difficulties that 
can be the inevitable result of higher 
education for many people. Addition-
ally, the private banks’ lack of account-
ability could create confusion for 
students regarding the consequences 
of defaulting on private student loans. 
In absence of requiring private banks 
to erase these defaults from the credit 
history of student borrowers who suc-
cessfully make the nine consecutive 
payments, private banks should at 
least have to be abundantly clear and 
up-front about whether or not they 
will comply with the Fair Student 
 

Credit Act.


D

ear Pamphleteers,

Oh, how I used to 

hate your guts. The way 

you 
owned 

the 
bricks 

of the Diag. 
Intercepting 
me at every 
conceivable 
pathway through the heart of 
my campus. Unavoidable obsta-
cles. Your arms extended, long 
towards me, blue, yellow and 
pink papers between your thumb 
and hand. “Come to my group’s 
event! Ahhh!” How you battered 
me with your announcements.

How, just to spite you, I’d take 

your pieces of worthless paper. 
Oh, I would smile back. Smile 
at you. Look you in the eyes and 
tell you I couldn’t wait to “Check 
it out.” Then I would proceed 
to fold your pamphlets into the 
sharpest of paper airplanes, hop-
ing you were still watching me, 
hoping that you felt your dreams 
being crushed and folded, and 
then I would fly them, ever-so-
gracefully, into the nearest gar-
bage can where they would crash 
and whimper. I’d hoped you’d 
notice that I’d opted for the trash 
as opposed to the blue recycling 
bin — the two are literally right 
next to each other — just to spite 
you more, secretly hoping that 
enough people would do as I 
did, and in some weird swing 
of events that was completely 
irrational, highly powerful “offi-
cials” would have to ravage the 
Diag garbage cans in the middle 
of the night. They would find 
thousands of your papers that 
were 
perpetually 
demanding 

things of me. They would see all 
of the paper you’ve wasted that 
could’ve been recycled.

Best case scenario: your group 

would be disbanded, or at the 
very least, suspended, and you 
would have time to think about 
what you’d done.

Oh, but time. Time. Time. 

What a mover and a shaker of 
minds. Like those paper airplane 
pamphlets, time has flown past 
me and found its way to waste. 
Now, it’s summertime. I sit here 
attempting to type, my butt on 

a concrete block, my feet on the 
brick where yours once stood, 
my only thoughts of you. You’ve 
been replaced now by sun, trees 
and the chirping of birds. But to 
say you’ve been replaced, if we’re 
going to be real — and I’m ready 
to be real now — is to be mistak-
en. You are irreplaceable.

Ssshhhhhh….. Do you hear that?
Well … there’s a little whisper 

of wind. A few birds. But, no, I 
didn’t really hear that. No! That’s 
because there’s nothing to hear! 
You’re all gone! No one is here to 
haggle and barter for my time.

“Have you heard about this 

App I invented?” “Pizza House 
Fundraiser on Thursday.” I can 
only hear you in my head. I’m the 
only one here.

To be alone is the worst condi-

tion for someone who spends the 
vast majority of their time mak-
ing fun of other people. I’m the 
only one left. I can only make 
fun of me for so long before I get, 
like, offended, you know? This is 
a lot different than previous sce-
narios. I feel my feelings. But I 
don’t feel your feelings. I am left 
to be oppressed by the spirit of 
my own silence, haunted by my 
best memories of you. They play 
over and over again in my mind 
… Every replay another menacing 
paper eagle, dissecting my weav-
ing intestines, my butterfly stom-
ach and my waning, regret filled 
heart. I’m chained to the top of 
this concrete block.

There’s Groove banging away 

on the tops of metal garbage cans 
while they stand on top of ladders. 
I used to cover my ears when I 
walked by, grimacing. But, oh, how 
they would smile, enjoying them-
selves, playing their music! There’s 
the Every Three Weekly, who I 
could’ve sworn were out there like 
every three days with their satiri-
cal commentary that made me 
so envious wallowing in my own 
lack thereof. There’s DoRAK, the 
a cappella groups, the activists, the 
artists and the religious guys with 
their bibles and flags. And how 
could I forget the Hare Krishnas? 
I simply never will.

And my most favorite of all. My 

very, very favorite. I really should 

make a shrine to her on top of 
one of the other concrete blocks, 
maybe sculpt one into a statue of 
her with a chisel and hammer or 
something. The brunette girl con-
ducting a simple survey for her 
psychology class. She was ask-
ing fellow pamphleteers, fellow 
students and simple passersby 
how they felt about the Squirrel 
Watching Club on campus.

She asked me.
I knew it would be too easy to 

criticize her and her survey. Look 
at her. She’s probably a freshman. 
Cute, young, innocent. Out here 
in the world, this big world, this 
tiny Diag, collecting opinions like 
acorns, storing all of the crucial 
data in her pantry of a three-sub-
ject notebook.

I did it anyways.
I said, “I think everyone in 

that club needs to get a job.” I 
said, “Including the squirrels! 
I mean who do they think they 
are?” Then I said, before turning 
away, “You’d probably be better 
off picking a job up too,” and I 
didn’t turn around to see her 
face or her reaction.

The horrible irony of it all. I 

didn’t even have a job at the time. 
I didn’t get one until like yester-
day. Who was I to say any of that? 
But even if I did have a job, that’s 
so stupid. What a terrible thing 
to say. The Diag is the domain 
for life. People doing what they 
like. Hey, the point of her going 
to school is to get a job anyways. 
I’m so dumb. Spirit of my silence, 
how can I forgive myself?

Dear Pamphleteers,
I don’t want to be bound to the 

walls of my own subpar, comic 
nutshell any longer. I want you 
to know I’ll be waiting for you 
on my concrete block. I can’t 
wait to see and hear about all of 
the events and fundraisers and 
action plans you have lined up 
for me in the fall. I can’t wait 
to hear about all of the dreams 
you’ve been dreaming up — all of 
the ink you’ve put on paper.

Sincerely,
ES

ELIJAH 
SPARKMAN

the time after I called my mom 
panicking, worried I would be 
unable to sign up for the next 
semester of classes because of the 
financial hold on my account. We 
have always somehow found the 
money, waiting until the closest 
paycheck or borrowing from fami-
ly. One semester, I personally took 
out a loan from my local credit 
union with my mom as a co-signer.

On my second FAFSA applica-

tion, I claimed my dad’s income as 
my parents had officially divorced. 
He had recently started a new 
welding job after being laid off by 
his previous employer; I received 
a Pell Grant and was able to do a 
work-study job. During the next 
few tax cycles, my mom claimed 
me as her dependent, as she was 
the one helping me financially 
far more than my dad. However, 
her income was increasing as 
she excelled at work, becoming 
a regional manager for Amtrak 
engineers in five short years. I 
received federal loans.

After moving out of the dorms 

sophomore year, I moved to Ypsi-
lanti for cheaper rent and began 
working as often as possible to pay 
off the loan from my credit union 
and to pay for living expenses. 
That year, I finally became actively 
involved in a student organization; 
something that is seemingly man-
datory during a university educa-
tion. Life became too much of a 
burden, financially, emotionally 
and physically. I slowed down my 

schooling, unable to fit all of the 
required classes for my dual degree 
into my remaining semesters. My 
summers were spent working to 
save up money for school.

After finally figuring out what 

I wanted from college, I have four 
classes to take to finish my sec-
ond degree. So, I was in the crowd 
among family and friends. But, I 
know I’m not the only one.

FAFSA 
measures 
our 
lives 

through a year of numbers. It 
doesn’t ask whether your parents 
nearly lost everything in the finan-
cial crisis of the early 2000s, how 
many times your house was almost 
repossessed, whether any of your 
family members suffer from a crip-
pling mental illness or if there has 
been any long-term issues that 
may affect your financial situation. 
FAFSA, like most financial aid, 
doesn’t care about the big picture. 
They are only concerned with a 
snapshot of the present.

A year changes things, but only 

so much. Analyzing how much a 
family makes in one year, while 
helpful, doesn’t necessarily pro-
vide adequate financial aid to all 
applicants. FAFSA is an important 
tool in helping students across the 
nation attain higher education. In 
order to further help students, it 
should start to consider long-term 
circumstances that affect a stu-
dent’s economic status.

Daily Arts Writer

It was a school night when Busi-

ness junior Gary King walked into 
the Michigan Union. King is pur-
suing a dual major in Business and 
organizational studies, and upon 
arriving he announces that he needs 
to get back home soon; he has a lot of 
homework to do. Most of his time that 
past week had been eaten up already 
while finalizing and releasing his lat-
est EP: Pre-Notions.

King released the alternative hip-

hop EP to his Sound Cloud in March 
and plans to have another project out 
in the next few months. He has been 
rapping for most of his life, and now 
that he’s at the University, with bet-
ter recording resources and a wider 
array of other talent to collaborate 
with, he’s looking to make some noise. 

King has been juggling school 

and music since he arrived at the 
University. A Detroit native, King 
started rapping in middle school and 
performs in the area as much as he 
can. He’s already performed at Ann 
Arbor’s Blind Pig, a University fra-
ternity, the Martin Luther King Day 
Symposium and some other open 
mics around town.

The show King remembers most is 

one of his first. He tells the story of a 
show with his friends at his church’s 
talent show during sophomore year 
of high school: 

“We messed up horribly,” King 

laughs as he remembers. “We had the 

coldest rhymes already set and then 
we went up there — we forgot every-
thing.” 

Luckily, the pastor approached 

him and his friends and offered to 
let them try again at the following 
mass on Sunday, in front of a crowd 
filled with friends and family that 
was roughly three times larger than 
the little talent show. King jumped on 
the second-chance opportunity and 
turned it into his launch-pad for his 
musical pursuits.

“I went up there, killed it; it was all 

cool. And then we ended up perform-
ing at the harvest fest; that was pretty 
dope. Then that’s how I got my first 
recording opportunity,” King said.

One priority for King in his music 

is creating a unique sound (as he says 
in “Choices (The Segue)”: “I just try to 
avoid the norm ’cause I’m tryin’ to be 
remembered”). He pays close atten-
tion to the underground rap scene, 
always looking for artists trying new 
things and creating anything alter-
native. A personal goal for King is to 
locate the next big name in the genre 
before they catch fame, but he also 
incorporates other rappers’ ideas into 
his own music.

On this most recent project, King 

worked with Kinesiology senior 
James Huang, who goes by the stage 
name “Blank Face Villain.” Huang, 
who has played piano all his life but 
only started recording in college, 
produced and mixed Pre-Notions. 
The duo worked out of the recording 
booths on North Campus, usually late 

on Saturday nights when they could 
get studio time. 

Huang said King introduced him 

to much of the underground scene 
and the two were on the same page 
for the type of sound they were look-
ing for on the EP. The beats are across 
the board, slow but driving, creatively 
blending computer-generated sounds 
and Huang’s piano. The EP has sooth-
ing tracks like “$ouls,” as well as some 
more chaotic songs like “Evolve.” 

What’s clear is that the EP isn’t 

merely two students dabbling in an 
after-school hobby; it’s pretty good. 

Unfortunately, Huang will be in 

graduate school at Northwestern 
next fall — though King doesn’t think 
it’ll sever the partnership completely.

“Chicago’s not that far,” King said.
Still, King himself said he always 

puts grades ahead of music. While 
the workload of a double major can 
be tough, King said staying organized 
and focused frees up time for him to 
work on his music. 

More than that, King said sacrific-

ing school for music would defeat the 
purpose of his rap’s message. While in 
a perfect world King would see him-
self rapping, he said no matter what 
he does he wants to be an example, as 
a good student to kids and as a whole-
some person to listeners at large.

He calls himself a “conscious rap-

per,” infusing his Christian faith, 
hard-working mentality and his 
belief in family into his lyrics. King 
said no matter what path he takes, 
whether in the business world or 

the music world, he wants to make 
a positive contribution to the people 
around him.

“I definitely want to get the right 

message across and help people in 
some sort of capacity,” King said. 

For now, King is working on gain-

ing attention for his music on Sound 
Cloud. Working mostly through 
word of mouth, King said this year 
he’s committed to performing as 
much as possible. 

As he continues to record new 

material, King is always looking 
for feedback, consulting friends 
he feels are tuned into the hip-hop 
world. Business junior Max Quer-
termous, a friend of King’s, serves as 
a first set of ears from time to time. 
As a fellow Business student, Quer-
termous can attest to the workload 
of the school — which he said isn’t 
unreasonable — but said King’s 
music doesn’t suffer from being one 
of two focuses.

Quertermous said he also watch-

es the up-and-coming rap scene 

closely and would compare King to 
others in the underground scene. 
He said what he likes about King is 
his unique message and approach to 
his music, declaring it one of his big-
gest assets. 

“If you’re serious about hip hop, 

you consider yourself a serious lis-
tener, and if you care about the 
music, then I would suggest that you 
do check out Gary’s music and listen 
to it closely,” Quertermous said. 

Yes, keep an eye out for the name 

“Gary King” when returning to cam-
pus next fall. King said the title of 
Pre-Notions is a not-so-subtle hint of 
things to come, saying his next proj-
ect should be his best work yet, some-
thing that should attract many new 
ears.

“This is just basically supposed to 

be an outline,” King said. “You know 
how you have papers and you make 
an outline before you get into a paper, 
or the real message you want to do? 
That’s basically what the idea of this 
was.”

Summertime 
brings 
warmer 

weather, sunnier souls and the 
season of music festivals. There’s 
something liber-
ating, refreshing 
— 
empowering, 

even 
— 
about 

being in sunny 
haze 
among 
a 

crowd of strang-
ers 
bonded 
by 

the love of cer-
tain bands and 
musical 
culture. 

Coachella 
and 

Bonnaroo 
are 

renowned 
for 

bringing concert-goers into wide 
desert and farm fields, but a newer 
trend has brought these festivals to 
cities for a change of pace and envi-
ronment.

Over Memorial Day weekend, 

Boston Calling Music Festival will 
hold its fifth event since its inception 
two years ago. What began as a sim-
ple idea to bring the festival culture 
to an urban atmosphere was soon 
picked up by the Bowery to sponsor 
the event to reality — first headline 
by The National in May of 2013. This 
year, Grammy award-winner Beck, 
My Morning Jacket and The Pixies 
will headline on May 22, 23 and 24, 
respectively. Other favorites such 
as Marina and the Diamonds and 
St. Vincent will be returning, while 

bands such as Tame Impala, Tena-
cious D and Ben Harper will make 
their Boston Calling debut.

To hype up both ticket holders 

and the city for the musical start 
to the summer, Boston Calling has 
been holding a block party concert 
every Thursday from 5 to 8 p.m. 
Last week, Tigerman Woah headed 
the first of the series in Downtown 
Crossing, where most attendees 
were regulars socializing after work 
or local passersby drawn to the 
springtime pulsation of sound. It 
was a small but hearty crowd enjoy-
ing a more private concert of a grun-
gier, edgier sound with a twang of 
blues. The party brought an eclectic 
audience from yuppies to older pro-
fessions, just like the diverse audi-

ence Boston Calling usually draws 
— a crowd of 20,000, from college 
students to families to independent 
fans of the music. Some come for 
the music, while others come just to 
enjoy the air of festivity.

Bernard, a 25-year-old finance 

worker from Lebanon, rocked out to 
the music up front even though he 
had never heard of the band before. 
He was spontaneously attracted to 
the event after stepping off the train 
led by the sentiment to “taste the 
local culture … know more about the 
local scene.”

What sets Boston Calling apart 

from other music festivals is not 
only the urban setting off of which 
the music resonates; the event, 
much like the block party series, 

has a lower key nature and also an 
open door reentry policy that allows 
goers to both explore the city and 
stay on the grounds for the concert. 
The schedule is structured around 
two stages so that no performances 
overlap, and attendees may see all 10 
acts.

Boston Calling intertwines both 

local bands and up-and-coming art-
ists amalgamated with big-name 
headliners — a way to expose the 
community to diverse musical cul-
ture. The festival brings in a wide 
variety of artists — it isn’t only an 
alternative music haven like most 
festivals are: It caters to an audience 
comprising wide demographics and 
different musical tastes and, hope-
fully, an open mind to new sound.

Boston Calling heads into its fifth year

Shut up and listen to 
‘Shut Up and Dance’
R

ock ‘n’ roll’s not dead. It’s 
sitting right at number 2 on 
the iTunes singles chart.

I’ll be the 

first to admit 
that I didn’t 
see it coming. 
Don’t get me 
wrong, I liked 
Walk the 
Moon’s first 
single, “Anna 
Sun,” as much 
as anybody. I’ve 
always been 
a huge fan of 
The Killers, Franz Ferdinand, Bloc 
Party and those other new wave 
revivalists, so if a band can take 
the characteristics of these bands 
— huge choruses, disco-influenced 
backbeats and rough lyrics about 
“towns” and/or needing to get 
out of them — and distill them 
skillfully into a new four-minute 
composition, my acceptance is 
basically a given.

That said, I didn’t expect to 

hear much more from Walk the 
Moon after “Anna Sun.” It was one 
of those huge songs that felt like a 
big hit if you listened primarily to 
the Alt Nation channel on Sirius 
and drove around with friends 
who’d sing along when it came on 
that station. I put the track on my 
iPod thinking that in a short time 
I’d scroll across the title and it 
would stick out like that guy who 
wore a Mitt Romney mask to last 
year’s Halloween party.

Then I heard “Shut Up and 

Dance” when it was first released, 
and it pretty much confirmed my 
prediction. Bland guitar chords, 
a catchy cookie-cutter chorus 
and no signs of innovation — this 
song wouldn’t last the rest of 
the month. Bands come out with 
new singles every day, and “Shut 
Up and Dance” didn’t have what 
it would take to avoid quickly 
getting lost in the shuffle.

That was August 2014, and in 

the subsequent seasons, Walk 
the Moon slowly slipped out of 
my consciousness. I didn’t listen 
to the radio at school, and I got 
caught up in other new releases — 
very few of which were from rock 
bands. I even, regretfully, deleted 

“Anna Sun” off my iPod.

But, like the whispers of that 

secret you knew no one would 
ever find out about, “Shut Up and 
Dance” came back to me. First 
it was innocuous enough for me 
to dismiss — I caught the closing 
notes as I walked into a store, and 
I picked it up from a passing car 
on State Street. Then my Twitter 
timeline seemed unusually 
excited for Walk the Moon’s show 
in Detroit back in April — an 
interesting blip on my radar, but 
not much more.

Finally, not long after the 

concert, I go to a party and pretty 
good music is playing, but nothing 
out of the ordinary — the great 
’00s nostalgia trips and the best 
hits of this school year. Suddenly, 
the choppy opening guitar notes 
of “Shut Up and Dance” echo 
around the room. I’m confused, 
but people are dancing. Everyone 
seems to know this song. And 
everyone seems to love this song. 
And everyone screams along to 
the chorus, because why the hell 
wouldn’t you scream along? After 
way too much denial, I realize this 
plain old rock song is a fucking hit.

Now, I stand by what I said 

— “Shut Up and Dance” is a 
cookie-cutter rock song. The four-
on-the-floor beat (God bless it), a 
singer declaring “this woman is 
my destiny” and a breakdown with 
the inevitable audience-clapping 
already inserted (genius!). 
However, “Shut Up and Dance” 
doesn’t work despite these clichés, 
but because of how effectively 
it executes them, and how great 
it feels when you can dance and 
sing along with them. That golden 
drum beat conducts your body 
and moves it exactly how it needs 
to; those audience cues will just 
ratchet up the anticipation and 
make everyone’s hearts that much 
more explosive when you hear 
it live. And Nick Petricca sells 
those lyrics with every molecule 
of air that comes out of his mouth, 
singing like he’s the first guy ever 
to call a woman Juliet and fall in 
love with her at first sight, like 
he’s losing his virginity and falling 
in love and getting married and 
raising children all on that dark, 

crowded, slippery discotheque 
floor. And then that refrain just 
tops it off. There’s no comeback to 
“Shut up and dance with me!” If 
you say anything in response to a 
command that joyful and assured, 
you’re a gutless asshole.

And even though I admit I was 

wrong when I first judged the 
song’s quality in the solitude of my 
car, I still have no idea how “Shut 
Up and Dance” made it to the 
mainstream. This is a song that 
came out last summer that’s finally 
peaking and poised to take over 
2015’s season of sunshine.

And it was an indie rock 

song, of all things, from a band 
with little previous pedigree or 
name recognition. At the risk of 
sounding curmudgeonly, right 
now is kind of a dead period for 
rock bands. Of course, plenty of 
bands are making great music, 
but it feels like ages since rock has 
been a regular on Top-40 radio. 
Hip hop, country and even EDM 
have all earned well-deserved 
greater relevance today.

That said, I still see rock 

poking out here and there. I 
hear it in music ostensibly made 
for kids, like One Direction’s 
“Little Black Dress” or Five 
Seconds of Summer’s “She Looks 
So Perfect.” (In fact, the girl of 
“She Looks So Perfect” could 
very well be the girl of “Shut 
Up and Dance” before she got 
a fake ID and traded in boys’ 
American Apparel underwear 
for a backless dress and some 
beat-up sneaks.) And I hear it 
when our generation’s few alt-
rock classics suddenly surprise 
a room, when “Mr. Brightside” 
comes on and everyone gets 
shocked and disoriented by 
euphoria. I suppose “Shut Up and 
Dance” just had the power and 
resilience to beat at the walls of 
the charts until it was heard, and 
I suppose that even if rock keeps 
getting topped on the pop charts, 
it’ll always be around, waiting to 
be heard. Because as soon as we 
hear it, we know it’s our destiny.

‘Gotham’ lacks 
development

TV REVIEW

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

Picking up in the middle of a gang 

war, “Gotham” ’s Season 1 finale, 
“All Happy Families Are Alike,” 
brought an end 
to the inaugu-
ral season of 
Fox’s 
uneven 

Batman 
pre-

quel. “Gotham” 
shouldn’t have 
gone beyond its 
initial 
16-epi-

sode order, but 
with the show’s initial success, Fox 
ordered extra episodes. This bloat-
ed an already thinly stretched sea-
son and created an underwhelming 
finale.

I’m not sure if there’s a good 

show in “Gotham,” but there are 
solid elements that make its strug-
gles even more frustrating. The 
escalating gang war between Car-
mine Falcone (John Doman, “The 
Wire”) and Sal Maroni (David 
Zayas, “Dexter”) was consistently 
one of the strongest aspects of the 
season. This mainly came from the 
scheming, Iago-esque presence of 
the future Penguin, Oswald Cob-
blepot (Robin Lord Taylor, “The 
Walking Dead”). Cobblepot’s plans 
for power and two-sided dealings 
with the two crime lords grew 
increasingly elaborate and were the 
best-constructed plot lines for the 
new series.

Fish Mooney’s (Jada Pinkett-

Smith, “Hawthorne”) return com-
plicates this conflict, introducing a 
third party. Fish has been a prob-
lematic character for the show, 
personifying several of its issues. 
“Gotham” is a muddled show tonal-
ly — it tries to walk the line between 
serious and campy but struggles at 
several points. The show is more 
successful when it leans to the grit-
tier tone within its gothic film noir 
styling. However, Pinkett’s over-
the-top performance clashes with 
the more grounded characters with 
whom she shares screen time, such 
as Doman’s Falcone.

Furthermore, Fish represents 

“Gotham” ’s biggest struggle: form-
ing strong, independent characters, 
particularly females. Too often in 
“Gotham,” supporting characters 
are merely objects in relation to 

primary characters: They exist in 
a vacuum without any real defini-
tion.

Take Barbara Kean (Erin Rich-

ards, “Breaking In”), Jim Gordon’s 
(Ben McKenzie, “Southland”) for-
mer fiancée. Barbara serves only to 
complicate the life of Gordon. Her 
struggles aren’t her own, but rather 
obstacles placed in Jim’s path. This 
became a glaring issue in recent 
episodes when Barbara became the 
target of the serial killer, the Ogre 
(Milo Ventimigilia, “Heroes”). She 
became little more than a damsel 
in distress for Gordon to save. Fur-
thermore, in the finale, Barbara 
spends almost the entire episode 
talking to Jim’s current girlfriend, 
Leslie Thompkins (Morena Bac-
carin, “Homeland”) about Gordon. 
In fact, Barbara is so defined by her 
relationship with Jim that she tries 
to kill Leslie, in an out-of-left-field 
move that reveals how shallow the 
writers have made the character.

The other issue in “All Happy 

Families Are Alike” was the anti-
climactic feeling it had despite the 
fact that there were big shifts in the 
titular city’s power dynamic. Major 
story elements were introduced 
leading up to the episode, including 
Gordon owing Cobblepot a favor, 
but too many of these were resolved 
with a wave of a hand and little nar-
rative buildup. Take the Gordon 
/ Cobblepot deal — an opportu-
nity to truly test the moral fiber of 
the nearly incorruptible detective 
is wasted on just having Gordon 
not leave Cobblepot for dead. The 
chance to have Gordon aligned 
with “the least worst option,” Fal-
cone, is dismissed because Falcone, 
after a whole season of fighting for 
dominance of the city, decides to 
quit because of a sudden revelation 
that crime isn’t the way to fix the 
city.

If there is one thing “Gotham” 

isn’t, it is subtle. Characters are 
painted in broad strokes and the 
obvious is often overstated. As 
Cobblepot stands on a rooftop pro-
claiming, “I’m the king of Gotham” 
this becomes readily apparent. As 
“Gotham” moves forward, it must 
become defter at developing char-
acters into actual people instead of 
plot points and creating fully real-
ized narrative arcs that crawl to the 
finish line.

Swag, and we had great leader-

ship, and we played some great 
ball.”

Wagner started off well, effi-

ciently recording outs. She shut 
down the Nebraska side in order, 
setting the table for the Michigan 
offense.

After causing no damage in 

the first inning, the Wolverines 
got the offense going in the sec-
ond. Following junior right field-
er Kelsey Susalla’s walk, senior 
catcher Lauren Sweet laid down a 
perfect bunt down the third base 
line to not only advance Susalla 
to second, but to reach base safely 
herself.

Sophomore 
third 
baseman 

Lindsay 
Montemarano 
then 

slashed a ball off the third base-
man’s glove into left field to knock 
in Susalla to score the game’s first 
run.

Freshman 
designated 
play-

er Aidan Falk grounded out to 
advance the runners to second 
and third. The other freshman 
in the lineup, first baseman Tera 
Blanco, stepped up next and hit 

a sacrifice fly to left field, scoring 
Sweet to put the Michigan lead at 
2-0.

“We’re having a lot of fun and 

we’re coming out ready to play,” 
Wagner said. “We love to be on 
the field and we just go out there 
and attack, sticking to our one-
pitch focus.”

The third inning started off 

with a bang on the Wolverines’ 

defensive side to help Wagner’s 
cause. Nebraska’s leadoff batter in 
the third, catcher Steph Pasquale, 
hit a 1-0 pitch deep to center field. 
The hit looked like it had a shot to 
go over the wall for a home run, 
but junior centerfielder Sierra 
Lawrence made a jumping catch 
at the end of the warning track to 
record the out.

The polished defensive effort 

continued in the bottom of the 
third inning. After making an 
error in the previous inning, 
sophomore 
shortstop 
Abby 

Ramirez put out all three batters. 
The outs included two cross-dia-
mond throws to first that drew 
cheers of awe from the predomi-
nantly-Michigan crowd.

Wagner didn’t allow a hit until 

the fourth inning with one out. 
Nothing would develop beyond it 
in the fourth, though, as Wagner 
kept the Huskers from scoring 
once again.

The bottom of the fifth inning 

started with two singles by Falk 
and Blanco. Ramirez came up 
next and put down a sacrifice 
bunt to advance the runners. The 
bunt was perfectly executed, and 
the Wolverines got lucky when 
the shortstop overthrew the first 
baseman. The error allowed a 
run to score, pushing the lead to 
three.

With junior second baseman 

Sierra Romero up with two run-
ners in scoring position, Nebraska 
found themselves in a situation 
they never want to be in. The fans 
might have expected what was to 
happen next. Romero didn’t miss 
the 2-1 pitch, smashing it over the 
center-field wall for a three-run 
homer. Romero’s third home run of 
the weekend pushed the Michigan 
lead to 6-0.

Wagner allowed two more hits 

in the seventh inning. One run 
would score, but that would be 
all the Huskers could muster as 
Wagner closed out the win with a 
groundout.

“I’m proud of our team,” Rome-

ro said. “I wouldn’t expect any-
thing less … Nothing really has to 
be said to our team. We know what 
we want and we had a chip on our 
shoulder this year. We wanted to 
come win the tournament and we 
did.”

The fans turned Buckeye Field 

into a temporary Alumni Field, 
and the Wolverines played like 
they were at home. When Michi-
gan plays its first NCAA Regional 
game, they will be in Ann Arbor.

But it isn’t the stadium, it’s the 

fans that make the team play like 
there’s no place like home.

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan softball team 

will begin the Regional round of 
the NCAA Tournament on Friday 
at Alumni Field. The Wolverines 
will host California, Pittsburgh 
and Oakland. Only one team can 
emerge from the double-elimina-
tion Regional round to move on 
to the Super Regional. The Daily 
breaks down each team compet-
ing for a chance to survive and 
advance.

No. 3 Michigan
The Wolverines (21-2 Big Ten, 

51-6 overall) are the NCAA Region-
al favorites.

Michigan will be playing with 

home-field advantage and is com-
ing off a Big Ten regular season and 
tournament title, not to mention 
they’re on a 20-game win streak. 
Junior co-captain and second base-
man Sierra Romero was just named 
ESPN’s Player of the Year and is on 
a hot streak entering the tourna-
ment — something that won’t bode 
well for opponents.

In three games at the Big Ten 

tournament, Romero went 5-for-
8 with 11 runs batted in and three 
home runs.

Sophomore left fielder Kelly 

Christner trails just Romero in 
team batting statistics, boasting 18 
home runs and a .420 batting aver-
age while leading the Wolverines 
with 74 hits.

Michigan’s pitching corps is 

expected to be dominant as usual, 
as the duo put together strong per-
formances in the Big Ten Tourna-
ment. 
Sophomore 
right-hander 

Megan Betsa recorded 15 strike 
outs and allowed zero walks in 
seven innings. Senior left-hander 
Haylie Wagner allowed only one 
run on three hits to lead the Wol-
verines to victory in the tourna-
ment championship.

With everything clicking for 

Michigan, it’s hard to imagine an 
upset in Ann Arbor.

California
The Bears (10-14 Pac-12, 38-16) 

will prove to be the greatest 
obstacle of the Regional for the 
Wolverines. Cal has a number 
of impressive wins against top-
ranked teams, defeating No. 8 Ten-

nessee, No. 9 Florida State and No. 
12 Arizona. Only three of its losses 
during conference play came at the 
hands of an unranked team.

There’s no questioning that the 

Bears have been battle-tested by 
a powerful Pac-12 conference, but 
they will need a number of players 
to produce in order to emerge from 
the Regional.

Centerfielder Jazmyn Jackson 

has been exceptional in her first 
season for Cal, recording a .446 bat-
ting average and leading the team 
with 78 hits. Left fielder Cheyenne 
Cordes and catcher Danielle Hen-
derson have been dominant power 
hitters this year, boasting 15 and 14 
home runs, respectively. The duo 
have also accounted for 119 of the 
team’s 286 RBI.

Though the Bears are more than 

capable at the plate, they are not 
nearly as strong in the circle. Right-
hander 
Katie 
Sutherland-Finch 

leads the team in innings pitched 
with 168, but has accumulated a 
mediocre 3.79 earned-run average.

Cal could make a push to emerge 

from the Regional, but it will likely 
be faced with the difficult task of 
outscoring Michigan.

Pittsburgh
The Panthers (11-13 ACC, 35-20) 

have earned their first bid to the 
tournament in program history 
and are looking to continue to take 
down powerhouse teams. Though 
Pittsburgh has an unimpressive 
record, it is fresh off a huge perfor-
mance in the ACC Tournament.

The second and third-ranked 

teams of the tournament, Notre 
Dame and North Carolina, were 
handed losses at the hands of the 
Panthers, and the selection com-
mittee awarded Pitt by punching 
its ticket to Ann Arbor.

The Panthers have unimpres-

sive stats — they are fifth in bat-
ting average in the ACC, recording 
a .293 team batting average. They 
also are eighth in the conference 
with a 3.90 ERA.

Despite the low batting average, 

Pitt still is first and second in the 
ACC with 445 hits and 82 doubles, 
respectively.

The Panthers struggle from the 

circle as well, accumulating a 3.90 
ERA that could be exploited by the 
other three teams in the field.

Pitt will have a tough road to 

get through the Regional, but at 
the moment it appears nothing is 
impossible for this team.

Oakland
The Golden Grizzlies’ are the 

Cinderella of the Ann Arbor region-
al. Oakland (14-6 Horizon League, 
27-22) reigns as both the regular 
season and tournament champion 
of its conference, but that isn’t as 
impressive when compared to the 
competition of the Big Ten, ACC or 
Pac-12.

It would be shocking if the Gold-

en Grizzlies advanced through 
Regional play, but they have a 
handful of players that could turn 
their current dream into a reality.

One of Oakland’s biggest assets 

is its speed on the base paths. 
Third baseman Morgan Muron and 
shortstop Sarah Hartley are both 
21-for-22 in stolen base attempts.

Hartley leads the team in home 

runs as well with 11 while posting a 
.366 batting average. The underdog 
squad’s biggest threat at the plate 
is first baseman Sara Cupp, who 
boasts a team-high .382 batting 
average and 43 RBI.

The 
Golden 
Grizzlies’ 
have 

leaned on right-hander Erin Kown-
acki in the circle this year, who 
maintains a 2.43 ERA and leads her 
team in appearances by 15 games.

Oakland’s journey will likely 

end at Alumni Field, but nothing is 
guaranteed in the NCAA Tourna-
ment.

NCAA Regional Preview: 
Wolverines set to defend 
home turf

Despite injury, 
Driesenga is 
dedicated to seeing 
Michigan succeed

By TYLER SCOTT

Daily Sports Writer

As good as sophomore right-

hander Megan Betsa and senior 
left-hander Haylie Wagner have 
been heading into this weekend’s 
regional round of the NCAA tour-
nament, the Wolverines’ pitching 
rotation today looks considerably 
different than anyone would have 
guessed it would during the early 
stages of the 2015 season.

Senior right-hander Sara Dries-

enga started the season as one of 
three major threats in the circle 
for the Michigan softball team. On 
February 21, Driesenga pitched five 
complete innings, allowing just 
four hits and one earned run dur-
ing a 13-1 Michigan win over Lip-
scomb. And then her season was 
derailed.

“You don’t expect (an injury) 

coming into the season,” Driesenga 
said. “I always expected to be able 
to contribute on the field.”

The game against Lipscomb 

would prove to be Driesenga’s last. 
Since appearing in eight games for 
the Wolverines at the beginning of 
the year, she has missed the major-
ity of the season with an injury 
— forcing the two-time first team 
All-Big Ten pitcher to adjust to a 
new role on the team.

As frustrating as it is being 

unable to take the field with her 
teammates and help win games for 

Michigan, Driesenga knows what 
she wants each player to be focused 
on heading into the NCAA tourna-
ment.

“Even if we do come out and 

score a lot of runs like sometimes 
we have, not getting complacent 
with that and not being content, 
always wanting to get better,” Dri-
esenga said. “Because those little 
things and that mindset is what’s 
going to make all the difference in 
the postseason.”

It would have been interesting 

to see how differently Michigan’s 
season would have taken shape had 
Driesenga, a team captain with a 
2.07 career ERA, not been injured. 
Throughout her career, Driesenga 
was an adequate producer at the 
plate as well, batting a career .272 
average and a .444 slugging per-
centage when she played mainly as 
a designated and utility player.

Instead, the Wolverines lost a 

decorated veteran on the field, but 
gained a steadfast leader in the 
dugout that still wants to contrib-
ute to her team in any way she can.

“Really what I’ve been focusing 

on is watching the game and really 
being into every pitch,” Driesenga 
said. “I guess (I’ve been) learning 
the certain tendencies of my team-
mates and trying to help them if 
they’re struggling. Or if they’re 
doing well I make sure to tell them,

Baseball thumps 
Eastern by 15

By ZACH SHAW 

Managing Sports Editor

No one in the stands Tuesday 

evening would’ve guessed that 
Eastern Michigan had beaten the 
Michigan baseball team eight of 
its last nine tries. Few would have 
guessed that the same Wolverines 
lost to the same 
Eagles less than 
a month ago.

On 
a 
cold, 

windy 
night, 

Michigan (14-10 
Big Ten, 32-21 
overall) 
hast-

ily 
unseated 

its 
Washtenaw 

County 
rival, 

pouring 
on 

17 runs in the 
first four innings to cruise past the 
Eagles (19-33).

With the 17-2 win and a 19-1 win 

over Northwestern on Sunday, the 
Wolverines have perfected their 
blowout look.

“We took advantage of the free 

passes that we got,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “With our offense, 
if you get that many free passes, that 
many walks, hit-by-pitches, errors, 
you’re going to score. I didn’t think 
we had an unbelievable day offen-
sively, but I thought what we strive 
for, which is quality at-bats, we had 
a lot of.

“Whether they were given to us 

or earned, it’s still stringing together 
quality at-bats together, and that was 
a positive tonight.”

In total, Michigan hitters reached 

base via 14 walks, 11 hits, four errors 
and two hit-by-pitches. Sophomore 
infielder Carmen Benedetti led the 
way for the Wolverines, going 4-for-4 

with three runs and 
three RBI. Benedetti 
now has 63 RBI, the 
most by a Big Ten 
player since 2010 
and good for third in 
the nation.

On the other side 

of the ball, Michigan 
used seven pitchers, 
who combined to 
allow just five hits, 
eight strikeouts and 

zero earned runs. With No. 13 Okla-
homa State coming to town on Thurs-
day, the committee — comprised 
mostly of lesser-used bullpen arms 
— gave some of the regular pitchers 
much-needed rest.

“We had kind of scripted it out, 

that that’s how we wanted the day 
to go,” Bakich said. “We were hoping 
that we would have a lead that was 
expanded that we could do that. Get-
ting all of those guys some innings 
pitched keeps everybody fresh for 
Oklahoma State.

“It was good to get everybody 

and inning or two, and everybody 

Wolverines to begin shootout 

with No. 13 Cowboys Thursday 

By BEN FIDELMAN 

Daily Sports Writer

Over its last two games, the 

Michigan baseball team scored 
an average of 2.25 runs per 
inning, blowing out Northwest-
ern in a rubber game, 19-1, and 
rolling over cross-town foe East-
ern Michigan, 17-2.

However, those two opponents 

combine to have just three more 
wins than the Wolverines (14-10 
Big Ten, 32-21 overall) on the sea-
son. No. 13 Oklahoma State will 
travel to Ann Arbor this week-
end to provide a tougher test. 
The series pits the Big Ten’s top 
offense and the Big 12’s leading 
pitching staff against each other, 
with high stakes for both sides.

As it stands, Michigan looks in 

from the outside on the field of 64 
teams that comprise the NCAA 
Tournament. Sitting at 83 in the 
Rating Percentage Index stand-
ings doesn’t look good for the 
Wolverines, who enter their final 
regular-season series. RPI takes 
into account both win percent-
age and strength of schedule, so 
a series win for Michigan over 
a highly-ranked (15th in RPI) 
opponent could help a late push 
toward the tournament.

“We know we haven’t done 

anything yet,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “We have a 
challenge with a ranked Oklaho-
ma State team coming in, but we 
just want to be playing our best 

at the end of the year because of 
the momentum that can create to 
allow us to extend our season as 
long as we can.

“The only way we’re going to 

do that is to play well, train hard 
and execute well. You want to be 
playing your best baseball when it 
means the most at the end of the 
year.”

Michigan also has a chance 

to qualify with an automatic bid 
by winning the Big Ten Tourna-
ment, which begins in Minne-
apolis next Wednesday.

The Cowboys (14-8 Big 12, 

32-16 overall) are a lock to make 
the NCAA tournament, and at 
this point are playing to improve 
their seed, secure the opportu-
nity to host a Regional and keep 
momentum rolling through to 
the postseason.

Much of Oklahoma State’s 

success this season has come 
from its conference-best pitch-
ing staff. Carrying a combined 
2.90 earned-run average, the 
Cowboys are projected to cause 
problems from the mound for 
the Wolverines from the first to 
ninth innings.

Pitchers 
Michael 
Freeman 

and Remey Reed highlight the 
staff, holding 1.16 and 0.92 ERAs, 
respectively. Freeman anchors 
the rotation, and Reed works pri-
marily from the bullpen.

On the weekend of May 1, 

Michigan faced No. 16 Iowa and 
its 2.84 ERA — similar to Okla-

homa State’s. Though the Wol-
verines lost two of three games 
that weekend, they scorched the 
Hawkeyes for an average of six 
runs per game. Breaking through 
with that offensive success will 
prove to be key this weekend if 
Michigan moves to pull the upset.

This will be just the sec-

ond series the Wolverines have 
played against a ranked opponent 
this season, but the lack of expe-
rience against top-flight teams 
isn’t shaking the team’s confi-
dence. Sticking to the approach is 
something the coaching staff has 
preached all year, and there’s no 
sense in deviating from that now.

“The mentality has really 

been the same since September, 
which is to just get better every 
day,” Bakich said. “That’s all we 
talk about, and there’s no secret. 
Everyone has goals and everyone 
wants to win championships, but 
those things happen because of a 
relentless attack on each day to 
get better every day, and that’s 
kind of how we approach it. Keep 
pushing the program forward, 
keep getting each individual play-
er a little better, and the whole 
team will get better.”

The public test for that men-

tality will come Thursday eve-

State kick things off at Ray Fisher

to prove to outsiders that they

The Michigan baseball team has outscored its opponents, 36-3 in its last two games

“We took 

advantage of the 
free passes that 

we got.”

Good job. Don’t think too 

much, just keep doing what you’re 
doing.’ ”

But 
Dries-

enga does much 
more than supply 
moral support for 
Michigan. She’s 
intimate with the 
craft of pitching 
as well as softball 
in general, and as 
such is a valuable resource for her 
teammates during in-game sce-
narios.

When assistant coach Jen-

nifer Brundage is relaying sig-

nals and calling pitches during 
games, Driesenga lends a valu-
able set of eyes to her pitching 
comrades. She’s on guard for 
lapses in fundamental mechan-

ics and stays 
wary 
of 

potential tells 
that 
might 

warn 
oppo-

nents of what 
pitch Wagner 
or Betsa are 
readying 
to 

deliver.

“I think I’ve definitely got-

ten closer with them over the 
course of the year,” Driesenga 
said. “I’ve been close with Hay-
lie (Wagner) because we’re in 

the same class, and last year I 
was close with Megan (Betsa) 
too, but I think our relationships 
have just developed because I 
can watch them.”

Dedicated to her desire to 

contribute and to see the Wol-
verines reach success, Dries-
enga has maintained a critical 
role within the pitching staff 
and developed a deepened bond 
with the other two hurlers.

“If they’re struggling with 

certain things, they ask me to 
watch them warm up or watch 
them pitch a little bit,” Dries-
enga said. “I think I’ve been 
able to help with them in that 
way and still just help them be 
confident.”

T
ennis topples 

Redhawks and Blue 
Demons, wins Region

By BEN KIM 

Daily Sports Writer

Tensions were high at the Varsity 

Tennis Center as the No. 11 Michigan 
women’s tennis team needed a victory 
in one of the remaining two matches 
in order to earn a spot in the Sweet 16.

Michigan was up 3-2, with junior 

Ronit Yurovsky down 3-1 in a tie-
breaking third set and freshman Mira 
Ruder-Hook’s set tied at 4-4. Hook 
was in danger of extending her match 
to a third set after winning the first.

With all eyes on her, the freshman 

was able to win the next two games 
and punch the Wolverines’ ticket to 
the Sweet 16.

Michigan (11-0 Big Ten, 26-3 over-

all) took the weekend, rolling through 
Miami (Ohio), 4-0, and grinding out a 
4-2 win against DePaul.

“We’re happy to get through,” said 

Michigan coach Ronni Bernstein. 
“We’re relieved and excited. The girls 
did a good job.”

In years past, the Wolverines had 

entered the NCAA Championships 
following a loss at the Big Ten Tourna-
ment. Things were different for Mich-
igan this time, having claimed its first 
Big Ten Tournament Championship 
in program history. The Wolverines 
fed off the success they found in the 
conference tournament.

“We have a lot of confidence com-

ing from the Big Ten Tournament,” 
said senior Emina Bektas. “We’ve had 
some really good practices. Not being 
able to come through (in past Big Ten 
Tournaments) has put our confidence 
lower than it usually is. Finally being 
able to come through has been really 
good for us.”

Michigan rode that confidence to 

a swift win over the Redhawks (8-0 
Mid-American, 17-6 overall).

The Wolverines quickly clinched the 

doubles point, never giving up a lead 
in either of the completed matches. 
Sophomore Sara Remynse and Ruder-
Hook took the first doubles match, 8-0. 
Yurovsky and senior Sarah Lee ended 
doubles competition with an 8-4 win of 
their own.

Michigan continued its dominance 

in the singles matches. Bektas was the 
first off the court with a 6-1, 6-1 victory.

“I just wanted to set a tone,” Bek-

tas said. “I wanted to get off the court 
quick, get a point up and not let things 

get away from me.”

Yurovsky and freshman Alex Najar-

ian would follow Bektas’s lead with tri-
umphs of their own. Yurovsky cruised 
to 6-1 and 6-3 victories, while Najarian 
took her match with 7-6 and 6-1 wins. 
The duo clinched the match for the 
Wolverines and earned them a sec-
ond round matchup against the 37th-
ranked Blue Demons (5-0 Big East, 
22-5 overall).

Michigan’s solid play continued into 

the doubles matches against DePaul. 
Lee and Yurovsky were conceded a 
lead, as they came off the floor with an 
8-4 victory. Remynse and Ruder-Hook 
ended the doubles competition for the 
weekend with an 8-4 win of their own.

The similarities between the first 

and second rounds ended after dou-
bles play. The Wolverines struggled 
in singles matches against the Blue 
Demons, though Lee gave Michigan 
the 2-0 lead with her 6-0, 6-3 victory.

DePaul roared back, winning the 

next two matches to even up the score. 
Remynse and Najarian couldn’t find 
their rhythm on their way to 3-6, 4-6 
and 2-6, 3-6 victories. The pair, along 
with Yurovsky, had a hard time on the 
floor as the Blue Demons gave them all 
they could handle.

“They just didn’t play that well and 

their energy wasn’t great,” Bernstein 
said. “They competed hard, but I don’t 
know if their body language and energy 
wasn’t as good as it needs to be. It was a 
bit of a struggle, but a lot of it was DePaul 
and how well they played them.”

Bektas gave the Wolverines the 

advantage with her 6-3, 6-4 win, giv-
ing them a 3-2 lead. In the end, Rud-
er-Hook won her match, 6-4, 6-4, 
and made a place for Michigan in the 
Sweet 16 for the fifth time in six years.

“I think those are the most fun 

moments,” Ruder-Hook said. “When 
everyone’s watching, you can just feel 
the energy. I’ve never had the oppor-
tunity to clinch a match and that’s 
exactly what I came here for.”

The Wolverines will face off against 

No. 6 Georgia in the next round of the 
tournament with a chance to advance 
to the Elite Eight for the first time in 
program history. After another strong 
weekend, it’s rinse and repeat for 
Michigan.

“There’s nothing to change, tennis-

wise,” Bernstein said. “I think we’re 
there now, we just got to relax.”

Countess, Norfleet leaving 
Michigan football program

By MAX COHEN 

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan football team’s 

secondary will have a new 
look next season. Fans already 
received a glimpse of redshirt 
freshman Jabrill Peppers play-
ing safety in the Spring Game, 
but additional changes are on the 
way.

Fifth-year 

senior 
cor-

nerback 
Blake 

Countess 
announced 
on 

his 
Instagram 

on 
Wednesday 

afternoon 
that 

he will not be 
returning 
to 

Michigan for his 
final season of 
eligibility.

“My past four years here at the 

University of Michigan have been 
great!” Countess wrote. “Noth-
ing but love and appreciation 
for Ann Arbor, the faculty, the 
coaches, the support staff and the 
great fans but after many sleep-
less nights and much prayer I 
have decided to play my final year 
of eligibility elsewhere. I truly 
thank those that have been there 
for me and hope you would con-

tinue to do so. #ForeverGoBlue.”

Countess started 30 games for 

the Wolverines during his career. 
He recorded six interceptions in 
2013, a season in which he earned 
first team All-Big Ten honors 
from the media and second team 
All-Big Ten honors from the 
league’s coaches. Countess start-
ed 10 of Michigan’s 12 games last 

season.

One 
day 

before Count-
ess 
posted 

about 
his 

transfer, the 
Wolverines 
officially 
announced 
the 
transfer 

of 
fifth-year 

senior corner-
back 
Wayne 

Lyons from Stanford. Lyons will 
be immediately eligible because 
of his status as a graduate trans-
fer. His arrival had been rumored 
for months and was confirmed by 
Michigan secondary coach Mike 
Zordich during spring practice.

Lyons recorded 128 tackles, 

three interceptions and three 
forced fumbles for the Cardi-
nal, playing in 43 games. Lyons’ 
mother, 
Gwendolyn 
Bush, 

works for the football program 

as the director of player devel-
opment.

“He brings great experi-

ence and ability to our second-
ary and special teams unit,” 
Zordich said in a statement. “In 
addition, Wayne is a super indi-
vidual who will achieve great 
things both on the field and in 
his future career.”

As first reported by MLive.

com Tuesday afternoon, rising 
senior receiver and kick returner 
Dennis Norfleet has been dis-
missed from the Michigan foot-
ball team.

No formal announcement has 

been made by the program, but 
according to Dale Harvel, Nor-
fleet’s coach at Detroit’s Mar-
tin Luther King High School, 
the decision to remove Norfleet 
from the team was a disciplinary 
one.

“Evidently he was dismissed 

from the team, Dennis informed 
us he was no longer on the team,” 
Harvel told MLive Tuesday 
afternoon. “Something about a 
disciplinary thing between him 
and (Michigan coach Jim) Har-
baugh. Whether it was academ-
ics or something internal, I’m 
not sure. He just said they had a 
disagreement and he was let go.”

“I truly thank 
those that have 
been there for 

me.”


By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Writer

A teenage YMCA volunteer 

crouched in the grass and aimed 
her radar gun at a five-year-old girl, 
who pumped her arms, lengthened 
her stride and bolted through the 
agility course.

“Thirteen miles per hour,” the 

volunteer told the young AFC Ann 
Arbor fan, who squealed with 
delight.

It may not have been the main 

event at Hollway Field at Pioneer 
High School on May 1, but it was 
definitely a highlight for the girl’s 
father, who high-fived his daughter 
after her flat-out sprint and reward-
ed her with a freshly-made donut 
from one of the local food trucks.

On the field adjacent to the 

YMCA course full of small victo-
ries, Associate Football Club Ann 
Arbor’s inaugural game in the Great 
Lakes Premier League was set to 
begin. The players come from all 
different skill levels, and about half 
are associated with the University 
of Michigan, competing at the club 
and varsity level. The other half 
comes from all over the nation, and 
some from across the world.

To the crowd’s enjoyment, two 

skydivers delivered the game ball 
from the cloudless blue sky just 
before kickoff. Over 2,000 fans 
attended 
the 
inaugural 
game, 

and the Main Street Hooligans — 
AFCAA’s rowdier fans — banged 
drums and delivered a bevy of 
chants from behind the home bench 
as the skydivers descended onto the 
field.

The chants projected across the 

pitch to the families sitting in the 
grandstand, where the bleachers 
were littered with green- and blue-
clad fans. Some donned apparel 
that boasted the team’s slogan, 
“Strength in the Oak.”

Even after the 2-1 loss to San 

Marino, fans crowded the tables 
where players signed autographs. 
All throughout the stadium, it was 
clear that the city’s newest team 
had planted its roots in the heart of 
Ann Arbor.

***
A ragtag group of players make 

up the roster. Two play on Michi-
gan’s club team, five compete at the 
varsity level and three used to rep-
resent the block ‘M’ in their college 
years.

There are 12 Division I soccer 

players on the roster, five of which 
play for Michigan: redshirt sopho-
more defender Michael Kapitula, 
redshirt 
sophomore 
midfielder 

Tyler Anderson, sophomore mid-
fielder Tristan Jacob, junior defend-
er Lars Eckenrode and senior 
defender Jack Brown.

Of the five, only Ann Arbor native 

Jacob was available for the inaugu-
ral match against San Marino. It 
was Jacob’s first day of eligibility, 
and also his first time playing with 
his new teammates.

Jacob graduated from Pioneer 

High School in 2014, but hasn’t 
played on Hollway Field in three 
years. He didn’t play for Pioneer in 
his final two seasons because of his 
involvement with the Crew Soc-
cer Academy Wolves, so he feels 
that he’s finally getting that missed 
experience back.

“It was great,” Jacob said. “My 

family was here, and I saw so many 
of my friends’ families here. Even 
my neighbors came out, and it made 
for an amazing atmosphere.”

Jacob is awaiting the arrival of 

his Michigan teammates, many of 
which went home for a week to visit 
with family, and he can’t wait to 
practice with them once more.

AFCAA coach David Hebestreit 

(pronounced heeb-street) is look-
ing forward to having the rest of his 
players for the summer as well.

“We’re waiting for 12 Division I 

players to show up, but that doesn’t 
mean the players that were here 
tonight won’t compete,” Hebestreit 

said following the May 1 loss to San 
Marino. “I think Lars Eckenrode 
will be a huge addition when it 
comes to leadership out of the back. 
Tonight we had good play out of the 
back, but we didn’t have leadership 
out of the back, and I think Lars will 
bring that.”

There are also players from Col-

gate, Xavier, Stony Brook, Albany 
and Liberty. The team boasts more 
than just players from all over the 
United States though.

“We have players from Switzer-

land, Nigeria, Germany and colleges 
all across the United States,” Hebe-
streit said. “It’s not a challenge at all 
— I mean it can be challenging (but) 
it’s not something I don’t want to do.

“I find it remarkably energizing 

to bring all of these people together 
and get into a training sessions and 
just let everyone be themselves and 
see what we can do with it.”

***
This isn’t the first time Hebe-

streit has brought a community 
together.

He has been the coach of the 

Michigan club soccer team for nine 
years, while also teaching creative 
writing, composition and literature 
at Livonia Public Schools. Now, 
he can tack on another title: head 
coach of AFC Ann Arbor.

“All three jobs are the same 

thing,” Hebestreit said. “All three 
jobs are community building, work-
ing with young adults and trying 
to help make an impact on their 
growth, whether that be in the 
classroom or on the field.

“I feel so fortunate, like I stum-

bled and somehow fell into a pot of 
honey. The ownership group bal-
looned, and then the community 
got involved, and then the players 
showed up. It’s really an amazing 
thing and I feel so fortunate to be a 
part of it.”

Hebestreit keeps in close contact 

with Michigan coach Chaka Daley, 
updating him on his players’ chal-
lenges and improvements. Unlike 
most colleges, where there’s a clear 
divide between the club and varsity 
level, Hebestreit has maintained a 
close relationship with Daley.

The two work together at the 

prospective player camp in the sum-
mer, allowing Hebestreit to become 
familiar with all of the club and var-
sity players. It made the transition 
to minor league soccer easier for 
some of the varsity members.

His familiarity with the game 

and the community seem to be 
working for AFCAA so far.

“I think it’s pretty evident that 

the team is important to the com-
munity,” Hebestreit said. “Our first 
game, which was just a friendly, had 
2,500 people there. It was just won-
derful, the whole event.” 

***
While attending a game at Hol-

lway field, there are two different 
seating options. The field is simply 
laid out, with an east section labeled 
“a little rowdier” and a “family seat-
ing” section on the west.

From the get-go, AFCAA’s co-

owners aimed to have both fan 
groups. According to co-owner 

Adam Lowenstein, both crowds are 
necessary for the team’s success.

“I think it will be something that 

people really look forward to every 
summer,” Lowenstein said. “Some-
thing that is engrained in the fabric 
of Ann Arbor, just like Top of the 
Park or Sonic Lunch.”

Adam Schmader sat on the oppo-

site side of the field while his two ele-
mentary-aged sons ran around with 
friends. He goes to some Michigan 
men’s soccer games with his fam-
ily, but was happy to hear that Ann 
Arbor would have its own team.

He enjoyed the game while his 

children explored. They could have 
been down by the fence watching 
the game, in the YMCA Kids Skills 
Area or listening to live music while 
eating snacks from one of the food 
trucks.

Fans are accustomed to buying 

name-brand foods from large cor-
porations at most sporting events, 
but AFCAA’S dining options are 
different. The trucks are all owned 
by locals, and they serve as a tes-
tament to Hebestreit’s dream of a 
soccer club and community inter-
twining. 

***
Since May 1, AFCAA has tacked 

on another loss with the absence of 
the majority of its 12 Division I play-
ers, but it also recorded its first vic-
tory in club history.

In its win against AFC Cleveland, 

the connection to the University 
was quite evident.

“We had eight or nine players that 

had ties to Michigan, so that makes 
it a little bit easier, but I thought the 
morale and chemistry was pretty 
spectacular yesterday,” Hebestreit 
said. “Even in those tough moments 
when we were up 3-0 and gave up 
two goals, there was no yelling at 
each other and people were still 
supporting one another.”

Its second home game is on May 

15 against Oakland United, and Ann 
Arbor fans can expect to see their 
neighbors, both in the stands and 
on the field. They can expect to see 
kids running through the YMCA 
skills course, trying to break their 
previous record.

And most importantly, they can 

expect to see their family to grow 
from beyond that of the Big House 
just across the street. With a pas-
sionate coach and a vibrant com-
munity, the ‘Oak’ can only grow 
stronger.
