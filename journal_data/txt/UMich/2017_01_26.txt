After his only opposition 

dropped 
out 
on 
Sunday, 

University 
of 
Michigan 

Regent Ron Weiser (R) is 
expected to be approved as 
the 
Michigan 
Republican 

Party chairman in February. 
With 
Weiser 
soon 
to 

balance positions in both 
the University and the state 
GOP, accusations of conflict 
of interest and defenses have 
risen from members of both 
parties.

Weiser unseated former 

Regent Laurence Deitch (D) 
last November to bring the 
current partisan count in the 

regency to a 5-3 Democrat 
majority. He had already run 
for a seat in 2014 but lost the 
election.

Weiser said his largest 

priority for the regency is to 
serve the students.

“I care deeply about the 

University, 
I 
care 
deeply 

about what its mission is, 
and I care deeply about its 
customers,” Weiser said. “Its 
customers are the students. 
We have to make sure that 
we’re serving well, providing 
… 
the 
highest 
quality 

education and opportunities 
for students at the lowest 
possible costs.”

Weiser 
announced

Jeanne 
Theoharis, 
a 

Brooklyn 
College 
political 

science 
professor 
and 

American 
culture 
Ph.D. 

alum from the University of 
Michigan, spoke to a crowd 
of approximately 30 people 
Wednesday evening in Tisch 
Hall on the role of Rosa Parks 
in the modern-day iterations 
of the civil rights movements 
like Black Lives Matter. 

Theoharis 
was 
invited 

to speak at the University 
as part of the bicentennial 
celebration’s 
themed 

semester 
initiative, 
which 

strives to explore the origins 
of the University of Michigan 
and its role in the state, 
country 
and 
world. 
This 

semester’s theme — Making 
Michigan — in part focuses on 
the history of the University’s 
political activism.

The talk was based on 

the findings and research 
published in Theoharis’s most 
recent book, “The Rebellious 
Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks,” 
which was awarded the 2014 
NAACP Image Award and the 
2013 Letitia Woods Brown 
Award from the Association 
of Black Women Historians.

Rosa Parks’ story and her 

rise as a leader in the civil 
rights movement often begins 
on a December evening in 
1955 when she refused to give 
up her bus seat to a white 

man, propelling the civil 
rights movement into action.

This 
simple 
narrative 

is the one that is often 
taught. However, according 
to Theoharis, it is missing 
key 
elements 
of 
Parks’s 

life. 
Theoharis’ 
historical 

account is one she believes 
is crucial to understanding 
and recognizing that Parks 
dedicated her life to civil 
rights activism.

“Rosa Parks is everywhere, 

yet most of what we know 
about her is wrong,” she said 
to the crowd. “I wrote this 
book as a response to this 
fable. We need to grapple 

with her actual life and 
legacy.”

Part 
of 
Theoharis’s 

confrontation with Parks’s 
role 
in 
the 
civil 
rights 

movement 
was 
filling 
in 

the historic gaps that often 
forget the roles of political 
organizing.

Theoharis 
began 
her 

talk with a broad history 
of Parks, beginning with 
an explanation that Parks’s 
activism began long before 
her stance on the bus.

In elementary school, a 

white boy pushed Parks. She 
pushed the boy back, drawing 
a reaction from the boy’s 

mother. The boy’s mother 
threatened Parks, but instead 
of resigning to the mother’s 
threat, Parks responded.

“I 
didn’t 
want 
to 
be 

pushed,” Parks said to the 
boy’s 
mother. 
Theoharis 

referenced 
this 
quote 

throughout 
the 
talk, 

emphasizing 
Parks’s 

commitment 
to 
rebellion 

from an early age and her 
feisty side.

By 
emphasizing 
that 

Parks’s 
commitment 
to 

change began long before the 
bus standoff, Theoharis made 
the point that enacting social 

As the University of Michigan 

begins 
its 
bicentennial 

celebration, organizers aim to 
convey the powerful impact 
its past and present students 
have had on society through a 
year of events, planned by the 
Bicentennial Office. 

This 
past 
fall, 
the 

Bicentennial Student Advisory 
Committee — comprised of 
36 students from all three 
University campuses — formed 
to ensure student involvement 
in the planning of bicentennial 
festivities. 
The 
committee 

serves as a sounding board 
for the Bicentennial Office’s 
events 
and 
activities 
and 

assists with student outreach 
activities.

Bailey Oland, Bicentennial 

Student 
Initiatives 

coordinator, 
emphasized 

the 
importance 
of 
getting 

students connected with the 
bicentennial planning, as she 
claimed 
most 
students 
on 

campus do not understand the 
relevance of the bicentennial 
to their own lives.

to support the Leadership

The Leadership Engagement 

Scholarship was created last

CAMPUS EVENTS & NOTES

Critically acclaimed author 

Heather Ann Thompson, a University 

of Michigan history professor, 

appeared Wednesday night on “The 

Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” 

where she discussed her research 

on mass incarceration in the United 

States and her new book, “Blood 

in the Water: The Attica Prison 

Uprising of 1971 and its Legacy.” 

Thompson is a finalist for the 

National Book Award and was 

named to 13 best books of 2016 lists 

by various publications. Her book 

received high praise from authors, 

professors and executives across the 

country.

“This is not an easy book to 

read — the countless episodes of 

inhumanity on these pages are 

heartbreaking,” the book’s review in 

The New York Times reads. “But it is 

an essential one.”

Thompson details the 1971 Attica 

prison riot at the Attica Correctional 

Facility in Attica, N.Y., to examine 

the history of mass incarceration and 

racial justice struggles in the United 

States dating back to the 1970s.

The landmark prisoners’ 

rebellion was sparked when inmates 

at the New York facility requested 

political rights and better living 

conditions. Almost half of the jail’s 

inmates rose up against the prison 

staff, taking 42 hostage.

After four days, prison 

authorities agreed to succumb to 

the prisoners’ demands. The riot 

ultimately left 43 people dead after 

state police arrived to retake the 

prison. Prisoners succeeded in 

shedding light on the conditions of 

prisons and correctional facilities but 

Thompson argues today, more than 

40 years after the riot, conditions 

remain poor.

“ ‘Blood in the Water’ tells of 

warning signs in 1971 that still exist 

more than forty years later,” writes 

Soffiyah Elijah, executive director 

of the Correctional Association of 

New York, in a review. “Heather 

Ann Thompson’s prophetic analysis 

is a sobering reminder that we must 

all care about what is happening to 

human beings behind prison walls.”

Thompson, a University alum, 

has conducted extensive research on 

examining the mass incarceration 

system in the United States. Her 

other publications include two 

articles: “Why Mass Incarceration 

Matters” and “How Prisons Change 

the Balance of Power in America,” 

both of which have been awarded 

media and journalism awards.

Thompson previously worked 

on the board of the Prison Policy 

Initiative and served on a National 

Academy of Sciences panel to study 

the effect of incarceration in the 

United States.

more important to you

“We want to make sure we 

have students engaged, we 
want to make sure students 
are interested, and so we want 
to make sure students know 
what’s going on,” Oland said. 
“We found out that, through 
our 
interactions, 
students 

have no idea what’s coming 
up and so we really wanted to 
make sure we had a channel 
of communication and a way 
to 
get 
students 
involved, 

and 
knowledge 
of 
what’s 

happening.”

As an alum and former 

member 
of 
the 
University 

marching band, Oland said 
she feels a special connection 
to the University and the 
spirit 
she 
felt 
during 
her 

time as a student. Due to this 
connection, she led the group 
in participating in a number 
of activities, such as making a 
video about the bicentennial 
for the homecoming pep rally 
and passing out bagels and 
T-shirts in Mason Hall.

Nursing sophomore Olivia 

Darany said she thinks the 

amount of diverse perspectives 
on the committee aid benefits 
students.

“With both graduate and 

undergraduate 
students 

representing 
almost 
every 

school 
and 
college 
across 

campus, there’s a lot of great 
perspectives 
and 
always 

a lot of brainpower in the 
room,” 
Darany 
said. 
“Last 

semester we spent a lot of time 
brainstorming the best ways 
to 
disseminate 
information 

about the bicentennial, since 
we really just wanted to focus 
on getting the word out about 
what would be coming in 2017. 
Now that it’s officially the 
bicentennial 
year, 
meetings 

are 
more 
geared 
towards 

discussing the actual festivals 
and events and how to make 
sure they draw crowds and are 
memorable.”

Engineering 
senior 
Azia 

Harris-Martin 
further 

explained the importance of 
having a diverse committee, 
and how it inspired her to get 
involved with the planning of 
the bicentennial and ensure 
her voice was heard.

“I by no means speak for the 

Black population at Michigan, 
but wanted to ensure that the 

voice of people that look like 
me were at least represented,” 
she said. “Although this isn’t 
the bicentennial of the Black 
student at Michigan, I am a 
proud Wolverine and I am 
honored to have an impact on 

such a momentous occasion.”

The 
committee 
worked 

closely with faculty to plan 
numerous 
events 
for 
the 

upcoming year. Darany said 
she is most excited for the 
finale 
of 
the 
bicentennial 

celebration that is set to occur 
in the fall, and she highlighted 
interesting events, like a time 
capsule launch — organized 
by the Michigan Bicentennial 
Archive — happening before 
then.

“Something else really cool 

is being carried out by M-BARC 

— 
they’re 
recording 

thousands of interviews of 
current students and faculty 
and sending them all up to 
space in a time capsule,” 
Darany said. “But what I 
really can’t wait for is the 
finale of the bicentennial 
next fall. There’s going to 
be a huge expo in the Diag 
with exhibits that feature 
departments, 
schools 

and student orgs from all 
three campuses, and it’s 
all capped off by HAIL 
storm, which is a light show 
projected onto the facade of 
Rackham Hall.”

Faculty and students alike 

concluded it is important 
to acknowledge the role 
of students in shaping the 
University 
into 
what 
it 

stands for today, and make 
them feel included in the 
bicentennial celebration.

“The bicentennial is really 

about students,” Oland said. 
“Without students, we don’t 
have a university.”

MAX KUANG/Daily

Investigative journalist Azmat Khan talks about social justice and the importance of local history at the annual SAAN Conference on Saturday at the 
Michigan League.

YES WE CAN , YES WE SA AN

chairman back in December. 
The 
announcement 
came 

after 
former 
chairwoman 

Ronna 
Romney 
McDaniel 

vacated the position to head 
the 
National 
Republican 

Party.

LSA 
senior 
Casey 

VanderWeide 
interned 
for 

Weiser on both his regent and 
GOP chair campaigns. She 
said his decision to run was 
made after Republican Party 
members approached Weiser 
and recommended him for 
the position in McDaniel’s 
absence.

“He 
was 
approached 

by multiple people of the 
party just because of this 
vacancy,” VanderWeide said. 
“Coming up in 2018, we have 
the governor, we have the 
U.S. Senate, you have the 
Michigan 
House 
and 
the 

Michigan Senate. There’s a 
lot of important races for this 
state and Ron has had such an 
incredible legacy helping the 
Michigan Republican Party 
and other Republican parties 
as well across the nation.”

Public 
Policy 
Lecturer 

Rusty Hills has served as the 
Michigan Republican Party 
chair twice. He said the job of 
the GOP chair is to turn states 
red, as seen in November.

“The chair’s job, really, is 

to elect Republicans and to 
assist them in their efforts 
to win office,” Hills said. 
“It’s real simple. It’s about 
winning elections.”

Scott Hagerstrom, Trump’s 

campaign 
director 
in 

Michigan during the election, 
was Weiser’s only opposition 
for the position.

“I am confident that Ron 

Weiser 
understands 
that 

the future of the Michigan 
Republican 
Party 
lies 
in 

embracing the constitutional 
principles 
that 
led 
to 

President Trump’s historic 
victory,” Hagerstrom wrote 
Sunday in a Facebook post.

Once it was announced 

that Hagerstrom canceled his 
campaign, many expressed 

concern 
over 
whether 
it 

was a conflict of interest 
were Weiser to hold both 
positions. 
Some 
have 

questioned whether it would 
be a violation of the board’s 
bylaws to do so. 

The 
Regental 
and 

Executive-Senior 
Officer 

Conflict of Interest Policy, 
Section 1.14 of the board’s 
bylaws, 
says 
a 
regent 

is 
considered 
to 
have 
a 

conflict 
of 
interest 
when 

they have “an existing or 
potential financial or other 

interest which impairs or 
might appear to impair the 
regent’s or executive/senior 
officer’s 
independence 
of 

judgment in the discharge 
of 
responsibilities 
to 
the 

university.”

Hills 
said 
being 
both 

a 
regent 
and 
Michigan 

Republican chair is not a 
conflict of interest, but rather 
an advantage because he will 
bring his resources from the 
state job to the University.

“The advantage, as I see it, 

is that as a party chairman, 
Ron Weiser will, obviously, 
come in contact with a great 
number of people,” Hills said. 
“By virtue of that, I think 
he’ll make connections that 
will rebound to the benefit of 
the University of Michigan, 
making 
fundraising 

connections, making framed 
interactions, being a positive 
ambassador for the University 
helps to put the University 
in a good light with a wide 
range of Republican Party 
members.”

SACUA 
member 
Silke-

Maria Weineck, a professor 
of German studies, however, 
believes Weiser should resign 
from one of his positions. 
She said Weiser’s support 
of President Donald Trump 
and his current stake at the 
University creates a situation 
where 
Weiser 
cannot 

represent both organizations 
at the same time.

“Trump’s general campaign 

and 
his 
post-election 

statements have show him to 
be deeply at odds with UM’s 
core mission,” Weineck said. 
“I think there’s a chasm there. 
The way our cosmopolitan 
institution would have voted 
is to the creation of a nation 
of 
knowledge 
… 
I 
think 

(President Trump) is a proven 

brazen liar and I think Mr. 
Weiser can either side with 
a liar or he can side with the 
University which stands for 
the unbiased quest for truth. 
These two are incompatible. 
He cannot side with both.”

LSA junior Collin Kelly, 

chair 
of 
the 
University’s 

chapter of College Democrats, 
said Weiser’s situation might 
result in students being a 
backburner issue for him in 
the future.

“Even 
though 
(the 

chair position) isn’t a paid 
position, it’s still one of the 
most 
important 
positions 

in the state of Michigan,” 
he said. “Here, running a 
flagship 
university, 
that’s 

very important and to have 
explicitly partisan ties is, at 
the least, a big distraction. 
There’s a danger and a worry 
that his chairmanship of the 
Michigan Republican Party 
will affect that and might put 
conservative politics above 
what is in the best interests 
of 
the 
students 
and 
the 

University.”

With these claims above 

his head, Weiser said his 
holding both positions is in 
no way a conflict of interest 
and, like Hills, he said he will 
try to use his chair position to 
help the University any way 
he can.

“The other people who 

are regents also have full-
time jobs so the regents are 
not full-time jobs,” Weiser 
said. “On the other hand, 
I do believe as chair of the 
party of Michigan, that will 
give me some opportunity 
to try to help the University 
when it comes to government 
policy because I’ll have some 
influence over the legislature 
and the executive branch.”

change takes time.

“I think often the way the 

story is told to us is she sits 
down and miraculously there’s 
this moment and then they 
win,” Theoharis said. “We miss 
the work of that, and for those 
of 
us 
building 
movements 

today, we have to see that 
that’s not the case, it takes a lot 
of work.”

LSA senior Lindsay Green 

appreciated this sentiment and 
plans to apply it to her daily life. 

“You 
don’t 
know 
when 

something is going to change, 
you have to choose to make 
change,” Green said. “I think 
that that’s really inspiring and 
a good reminder that today we 
have to choose to do that even 
if we might not get any positive 
outcome right away.”

Theoharis emphasized this 

idea throughout her talk, while 
also trying to communicate to 

students the idea that social 
change is not always positively 
received.

“Most Americans did not 

agree with the civil rights 
movement when it happened,” 
she said. “But it’s important to 
remember that doing the work 
of justice is not necessarily 
popular at the time, there’s 
nothing natural about it.”

By the end of the talk, 

Theoharis had elaborated on 
Parks’ story, and she inspired 
students to enact changes in 
their own communities.

LSA senior Lauren Rose was 

inspired by Theoharis’s talk 
and she plans to use lessons 
learned from the talk in her 
own community. 

“It’s important to be aware 

that the smallest things can 
make a huge change and a huge 
impact,” she said. “I think that 
I’m going to take that and go 
forward in terms of how I’m 
going to continue my activism 
in my own community.”

resolution states. 

Engineering 
Rep. 
Tania 

Haddad, 
an 
Engineering 

senior, said the resolution can 
provide more funds for the 
scholarship.

“We 
are 
especially 

passionate 
about 
this 

scholarship and establishing 
it so it can have a large 
enough 
endowment 
and 

have a profound and helpful 
impact on multiple students 
on campus,” she said.

Recipients 
are 
expected 

to serve as future mentors 
to 
younger 
students, 
and 

Schafer 
asked 
the 
board 

to 
consider 
donating 
to 

the 
scholarship—aimed 
at 

improving 
socioeconomic 

inclusion— which was well 
received by the regents. A 
recent internal survey of CSG 
found the body is mostly male 
and white and 37.2 percent of 
members come from homes 
earning more than $250,000 
a year.

“Seventy-five percent of 

CSG members come from 
a household from a total 
income of over $100,000,” 
Schafer said at the October 
meeting. “This simply does 
not reflect the experiences of 
many students on campus.”

To 
qualify 
for 
the 

scholarship, 
potential 

recipients must be full-time 
students at the University of 
Michigan, 
receiving 
need-

based funds from the Office 

of Financial Aid and either 
currently be a leader in a 
student 
organization 
or 

aspiring to be one.

Rackham 
student 
Rep. 

Andy Snow was critical of the 
idea, noting its similarities to 
a regressive tax.

“At the end of the day, I 

don’t care that it’s generally 
going to help students who 
need money — I see the 
student fee as basically a 
regressive tax for students 
the most, in general, and I do 
find it massively, massively 
insulting that we just act 
like financial aid covers it,” 
he said to the body. “People 
take out loans and pay, not 
only that fee, but finally pay 
back quite a bit when they 
finally get the money to do 
it, so without reducing where 

people pay, I will not be able 
to support this.”

Snow 
continued 
to 

criticize 
the 
body 
for 

introducing the resolution, 
stating it was against many 
of CSG’s beliefs.

“I don’t see fundamentally 

how so many of us can be 
against tuition hikes and 
increases and still be in 
support of this,” he said.

The Regents voted this 

July to increase tuition by 3.9 
percent for in-state students 
and 4.4 percent for out-of-
state 
students, 
translating 

to a $546 per year tuition 
increase for in-state students 
and $1,934 for out-of-state 
students. 

The resolution was tabled 

for further review at the 
resolutions committee.

looking into mental health, 
and are listening. It’s nice to 
know that someone is taking 
your concerns and taking them 
higher.”

To gain information and ideas 

for potential recommendations 
and policies, organizers asked 
students to voice their concerns 
and suggestions in small groups 
to further discuss ideas. Task 
force co-chair Yumi Taguchi, 
an LSA senior, explained how 
the setup of the event was 
important in furthering the 
discussion of mental health 
issues.

“Both the surveys and the 

town hall are so important for 
this discussion,” Taguchi said. 
“We hear a lot of different 
stories about resources and 
the climate on campus, but this 
format lets us record it in a 
quantitative way in order for us 
to present it to administration, 
to actually make a difference.”

Data 
from 
the 
resource 

innovation 
survey 
reported 

90.3 percent of students are 
aware 
of 
Counseling 
and 

Psychological 
Services, 
but 

many students in the breakout 
groups 
pressed 
for 
more 

targeted campaigns to boost 
awareness. 
LSA 
sophomore 

Sujay Shetty, president of the 
Residence Halls Association, 
noted students living in dorms 
— 
particularly 
incoming 

freshmen — would benefit from 
an increase of awareness.

“Many students living in 

residence halls are freshmen,” 
he said. “Freshman year comes 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
transitional 

stressors. They are a population 
that needs a push in knowing 
what’s there for them.”

The task force reported most 

students understand resources 
available on campus, but still 
encounter significant barriers 
to utilize them. Respondents 
cited negative experiences with 
CAPS, anxiety about making 
appointments, 
accessibility 

and a fear of stigma from other 
students.

CAPS has focused recent 

efforts on equipping faculty 
and staff with diagnostic tools 
to field student mental health 
concerns, 
but 
the 
surveys 

revealed a lingering divide in 
the 
classroom. 
Eighty-seven 

percent of faculty respondents 
felt 
comfortable 
discussing 

and/or providing mental health 
accommodations for students, 
yet 68 percent of students 
felt comfortable approaching 
professors about mental health 
accommodations.

Task force members wore 

and handed out T-shirts with 
semicolons printed on them. 
The shirts are the outcome of 
a CSG resolution that allocated 
money for their production, 
representing 
Project 

Semicolon, which was created 
for individuals who were going 
through struggles with mental 
illness and whose story could 
have stopped moving forward, 
but did not.

Schafer lauded task force 

members for organizing he 
called “crucial” for organizing 
crucial 
University 
policies 

about mental health.

“These 
policies 
will 

normalize 
mental 
illness 

and 
expand 
student 
access 

to invaluable resources and 
strengthen the mental health 
climate in classrooms,” he said.

I

n October 2015, I attended a 
talk featuring Piper Kerman, 
author 
of 
the 
memoir 

“Orange Is The New 
Black: My Year in a 
Women’s 
Prison,” 

which 
inspired 
the 

award-winning Netflix 
television 
show. 

Kerman devoted much 
of her time to talking 
about the importance 
of criminal justice 
reform, 
and 
the 

auditorium was full 
of people receptive to 
her message.

At the time, thanks to the work 

of advocates like Kerman, there 
was bipartisan acknowledgment 
that the criminal justice system 
was 
unfair, 
ineffective 
and 

inefficient. It was one of President 
Obama’s key objectives and one of 
his few agendas that didn’t receive 
pushback from Republicans in 
Congress. As such, it seemed 
like criminal justice reform was 
inevitable. In Trump’s America, 
though, it seems unimaginable.

It’s quite easy to see why the 

system needs to be reformed. The 
United States accounts for 4.4 
percent of the world’s population 
but accounts for 22 percent of the 
world’s prison population. With 
716 prisoners per 100,000 people, 
the United States has the highest 
prison population rate in the world. 
However, there is no evidence 
to suggest that this high rate of 
incarceration is due to high rates 
of crime. In fact, the International 
Crime Victims Survey shows 
that the United States has similar 
rates of criminal victimization as 
Western European countries.

Furthermore, 
the 
United 

States’ 
staggeringly 
high 

rates 
of 
incarceration 
have 

disproportionately 
affected 

young Black men with low levels 
of education. As of 2008, one 
in 10 young African-American 
men with high school diplomas 
were in jail or prison. For Black 
male high school drop-outs, the 
incarceration rate was 37 percent. 
Given how difficult it is for 
ex-offenders to gain employment 
and the disenfranchisement of 
ex-felons in many states, these 
high incarceration rates can have 
lasting negative impacts on the 
African-American 
community. 

Thus, 
mass 
incarceration 

perpetuates cycles of economic 
and racial inequality.

There are also very high fiscal 

costs to the criminal justice 
system. In the fiscal year of 2013 
alone, the budget request for the 
Federal Bureau of Prisons was $6.9 
billion and accounted for more 
than 25 percent of the Department 
of Justice’s budget.

This 
is 
hardly 
surprising 

given the United States’ abysmal 
recidivism rates. One study found 

that within five years 
of release, about 76 
percent 
of 
released 

prisoners 
were 

rearrested. Therefore, 
it’s hard to ignore 
that the U.S. criminal 
justice 
system 
has 

failed to reform the 
prisoners 
whom 
it 

incarcerates, allowed 
for unequal and unjust 
outcomes and, in the 

process, racked up a huge 

bill for U.S. taxpayers.

Due to increasing awareness 

of these concerns, the pendulum 
of public opinion has swayed 
toward 
supporting 
criminal 

justice reform. This push for reform 
was clear in October 2015, when 
bipartisan legislation was proposed 
in the Senate to reduce the length 
of mandatory minimum sentences 
and ban solitary confinement for 
juveniles, among many other reforms.

Unfortunately, 
and 
despite 

diverse and powerful support, 
the bill languished in the Senate. 
Though it was crafted by senators 
on both sides of party lines, 
Trump’s law-and-order campaign 
brought 
back 
the 
“tough-on-

crime” rhetoric that altered the 
conversation and the political 
dynamics. This change in tone 
permitted (and likely motivated) 
several prominent Republicans to 
vocally oppose the once-popular bill. 
Ultimately, Senate Majority Leader 
Mitch McConnell did not allow a 
vote on the proposal, deeming it too 
controversial and divisive.

If the failure of Congress to pass 

a bipartisan bill addressing mass 
incarceration dealt a blow to the 
goal of criminal justice reform, 
Trump’s appointment for attorney 
general delivered the knockout 
punch. The new attorney general, 
Jeff Sessions, was one of the 
Republican senators who opposed 
the bill and prevented its success. 
A look at his history on criminal 
justice paints a complicated picture 
that leans toward favoring harsh 
punishment over rehabilitation, 
which calls into question his 
commitment to promoting racial 
equality broadly and criminal 
justice reform specifically.

During Sessions’ confirmation 

hearing, Rep. Cedric Richmond 
(D–Calif.) said, “Sen. Sessions has 
advanced an agenda that will do 
great harm to African-American 
citizens 
and 
communities.” 

Additionally, civil rights leader 
Sen. John Lewis (D–Ga.) said, 
“Those who are committed to 
equal justice in our society wonder 
whether Sen. Sessions’ calls for 
law and order will mean today 

what it meant in Alabama when I 
was coming up back then.”

How valid are those fears, and 

can we really assume that criminal 
justice reform will be prevented 
at a national level for the next 
four to eight years? That’s a hard 
question to answer at this point 
in the administration, but a look 
at the new White House website 
might be the best indication we 
have right now. The website does 
not show criminal justice reform 
as one of the top issues but does 
cite “Standing Up For Our Law 
Enforcement Community” as a 
pressing concern.

Though this is surely a noble 

goal, it is simply not a sufficient 
response to the problems plaguing 
the criminal justice system. In fact, 
unquestioning and unconditional 
support of law enforcement can be 
dangerous when police are abusing 
their power. Federal investigations 
have been essential in exposing 
the systemic violation of the law 
and racial discrimination by police 
departments, such as in Ferguson 
and Chicago.

Under the heading of “Standing 

Up For Our Law Enforcement 
Community,” the White House 
website states, “Our country needs 
more law enforcement, more 
community engagement, and more 
effective policing.” If correctly 
implemented, 
these 
changes 

could certainly help improve 
our criminal justice system. But 
they won’t mean anything in the 
absence of comprehensive reform. 
This means that there must be 
substantial changes to sentencing 
laws and reentry programming. 
It also means that police and 
prisons need to continue to be held 
accountable for discrimination 
and unjustified use of force.

These 
goals 
may 
seem 

impossible, or at least impractical, 
in the new administration, but 
it’s important to remember that 
change does not need to happen at 
a federal level to make a difference. 
State legislation has, can and will 
make a huge difference in the 
battle for criminal justice reform. 
In Michigan, for example, a 19-bill 
package was re-introduced that 
would reform the state’s parole 
and probation systems.

It’s time for us to push our state 

legislators to pick up where our 
national legislators left off. Our 
administration may have changed 
since last October when I went 
to see Piper Kerman talk and 
criminal justice reform was all but 
certain. However, we as a nation 
have not changed, and we can 
work to enact change ourselves.

A

fter the election, like 
many 
of 
my 
fellow 

students, I had mixed 

feelings. However, unlike many 
of my friends, I felt a small 
sense of relief. I knew that 
this was going to be a time of 
incredible upheaval and chaos 
in our country; however, I was 
to be exempt from that chaos as I 
was planning on studying abroad 
for the first five months of the 
Donald Trump administration. 
For weeks, I bragged that I 
wasn’t going to have to deal 
with the “peaceful exchange 
of power” because I would be 
nearly 4,000 miles away.

For my first few weeks in 

Paris, I tried my best not to 
think about Trump. Every 
time my host mother brought 
up something he had said on 
TV I would quickly change the 
subject. I would casually scroll 
through my Facebook feed, 
stopping on the occasional cat 
video and not much else. I was 
under the impression that I had 
escaped (for the time being) 
and attempted to focus on my 
life abroad.

What I didn’t realize was 

just how small this world 
has become. With the advent 
of nearly ubiquitous access 
to social media, there is no 
such thing as “escaping to 
another country” anymore. I 
thought back to all the people 
who threatened to move to 
Canada after Trump’s election, 

hoping they had realized by 
now that running away is the 
opposite of a solution. While 
his policies may not directly 
affect me while I’m a resident 
of France, that doesn’t mean I 
don’t hear about them or feel 
the emotional blowback from 
knowing that his policies are 
affecting many people I love.

My 
attitude 
completely 

changed the day of the Women’s 
March on Paris. I woke up late 
the day after the inauguration 
and lazily checked my Facebook 
feed. I saw that one of my new 
friends from my program in 
Paris had posted that he would 
be 
attending 
the 
Women’s 

March. I checked out the 
Facebook event and after about 
30 seconds of deliberating if 
I would rather stay in bed, I 
decided to go. I quickly found 
out that nearly every student 
from my study abroad program 
was also going.

A 
group 
of 
my 
fellow 

students and I met up and 
watched as thousands upon 
thousands of people slowly 
gathered in Human Rights 
Square 
in 
the 
shadow 
of 

the Eiffel Tower. Being the 
unorganized 
international 

students that we are, none of us 
remembered to bring signs, but 
we spent a great deal of time 
admiring the signs around us 
in both French and English. 
We quickly realized that many 
of the people around us were 
American, not French. I had no 
idea there were this many of us 
in Paris.

The march finally began 

and, as I’m sure many others 
who 
participated 
in 
the 

marches around the world did, 
I felt an overwhelming sense of 
solidarity — a feeling that I’m not 
sure I had felt in my time abroad 
thus far. While our program 
requires that we speak French 
at all times, we all slowly slipped 
into English, feeling that this 
protest constituted a reasonable 
exception to the rule. All around 
us, bands played, people danced 
and crowds shouted chants in 
both French and English.

What the march made me 

realize is that politics is a 
global issue, not just a national 
one. It is now estimated that 
the march reached millions 
of women in the United States 
and across the globe, making it 
the biggest peaceful protest in 
American history. Personally, 
I have never been a part of 
an event that massive in my 
entire life. Before the march, 
I didn’t want anything to do 
with American politics; they 
had exhausted me while I was 
back home and all I wanted was 
an escape. After the march, I 
was so incredibly grateful to 
have the chance to stand up for 
what I believe in while abroad. 
It gave me hope, it made me 
feel like I still have a place in 
the debate, it made me want 
to get involved again. Most 
importantly, it woke me up.

Thinking, not doing

AUSTIN XU | OP-ED

I

’m an engineer. You know, 
one of those elitist hermits 
who resides on North 

Campus and only occasionally 
takes 
the 
Bursley-Baits 

bus down to chastise those 
unfortunate 
non-engineers 

on 
Central 
Campus? 
Yep. 

Even worse, I’m an electrical 
engineer. You know … from the 
EECS department? I’m one of 
those snobs.

I believe that being an 

engineer is just as difficult as 
any major in “LS and Play.” 
There may be differences in 
workload, 
scheduling 
and 

campuses, but at the end of the 
day, a college education is about 
learning. Yet I feel “learning” 
has become somewhat lost 
in the day-to-day clutter of 
college lives. For me to fully 
encompass college, I strive to 
understand the how and why 
behind concepts, not just how 
to solve problems. After all, 
learning is just the beginning of 
my journey; an in-depth grasp 
of the underlying ideas enables 
me to innovate with a full 
comprehension of the problem 
at hand. With club meetings, 
research, work, term papers 
and weekly homework sets, 
“learning” has been overtaken 
by what I call “doing.”

My 
mother 
has 
always 

told me that education is 
the one thing that cannot be 
taken from me. Wherever I 
go, whatever I do, a higher 
education is invaluable. And 
it’s not because I can memorize 
an entire chart of Laplace 
transformations, 
recite 

Maxwell’s equations or tell the 
difference between dynamic 
and static polymorphism. No, 
these explicit things — or any 
of the numerous equations and 
facts I’ve crammed into my 
head — are not going to land 
me a job or even advance my 
academic career.

You may stop me here and 

ask, “Don’t you need to know 
those things to do well?” We’ve 
arrived at my point. How I 

define academic success isn’t 
through a number out of four 
or even 4.4 (I’m looking at you, 
Ross), but rather by how much 
I have thought, am thinking 
and will think. Because at 
the end of the day, education 
comes down to teaching a set of 
critical thinking skills.

It’s easy to get caught up in 

“doing things.” But what does 
this mean? Time and time 
again, I have heard people 
say, “Oh, it won’t be bad after 
I memorize these equations,” 
or “I’ll just pack my cheat 
sheet with these equations.” 
Number crunching. Plug and 
chug. Is that the point of our 
education? When we step into 
the workforce, we have all 
the resources available to us. 
There’s no need to memorize 
the formulas off the top of 
your head. In the real world, 
job performance is ultimately 
measured by how much you 
think. Once again: thinking. 
I’m 
a 
firm 
believer 
that 

understanding course material, 
making sure you know how the 
equations are derived, how the 
certain relationships are formed 
or why a certain concept is the 
way it is serves a far greater 
purpose than memorizing.

And it’s not just me who 

thinks that way. Eric Mazur, 
a 
professor 
at 
Harvard 

University, felt the same way 
after testing his introductory-
level 
students 
conceptually. 

In his article on assumptions 
in education, Mazur describes 
the outcomes from traditional 
lecture and from an alternative 
approach where students are 
required to read the material 
before coming to a discussion-
based 
class 
facilitated 
by 

iClickers. He found in the 
alternative approach students 
were able to better internalize 
the material, which led to 
improved performance on both 
conceptual 
and 
traditional 

problems. While this article 
was 
published 
more 
than 

eight years ago, the message 
is timeless: A fundamental 
understanding 
of 
concepts 

enables students to generalize 
their approach to any given 

problem while honing their 
critical thinking skills. 

Rote 
memorization 
will 

only get you so far. It might 
get you a college degree, but 
it doesn’t advance you as a 
person. It doesn’t develop the 
critical analysis skills that are 
necessary to do any job, let alone 
an engineering job. It robs you 
of your time at an institution 
of higher learning. Having an 
in-depth understanding of the 
material presented in class 
certainly helps. Sure, you may 
never use 90 percent of the 
class material, but having that 
baseline knowledge to build 
off of serves as the foundation 
of 
comprehending 
high-level 

problems in the “real world.” 
By 
knowing 
the 
underlying 

theory and relationships of the 
final product or solution, as an 
engineer I can easily identify 
problems I may encounter, 
outline 
different 
routes 
to 

take and then decide between 
trade-offs. 

As someone who used the 

brute force of memorization 
to get through high school, it 
is probably hypocritical of me 
to comment on learning. But 
the more time I spend here at 
the University of Michigan, the 
more success I find in diving 
deeply into the course material, 
picking the brains of professors 
and exploring the world through 
research. I’ll only be in such an 
academic environment once, an 
environment where people are 
obsessed with learning. It makes 
me want to learn. Think. Question. 
Examine. This translates not only 
in class but also to projects where 
I can “get my hands dirty” and 
build something.

My mother was right, but her 

words need a bit of tweaking. 
The critical thinking gained 
through higher education is 
the one thing that cannot be 
taken from me. From today to 
the day I take my last steps on 
campus, to the day I take my 
last steps at my workplace, I 
hope to be learning, exploring 
and, of course, thinking.

The Chanel Effect: Why I 
still love Karl Lagerfeld

Label’s latest Paris Couture show reminds us that innovation 
isn’t the only way to win the heart of the fashion industry

It’s Paris Couture Week.
Twice a year, once in February 

and again in July, the city of 
love is enveloped in a world of 
hand-embroidered, 
expertly 

hairsprayed fantasy. Few know 
the world of one-of-a-kind design 
better than Karl Lagerfeld. He’s 
been around the bend of fashion’s 
greatest stages time and time 
again. He’s designed for the likes of 
Balmain and Chloé, and currently 
serves as the creative director 
Fendi and his own eponymous 
label. Why, then, when we hear his 
name, do we only think of Chanel?

It’s Chanel. The interlocked 

pair of C’s on a quilted, chain-
linked bag. The one name in 
fashion 
known 
by 
everyone 

before us that will likely remain 
in ubiquity for the next century. 
I don’t give a shit if we have seen 
that same tweed suit from Karl 
before — it’s Chanel, for god’s sake.

In a perfect world, legacy 

wouldn’t be a determining factor 
in 
the 
what’s-hot-what’s-not 

debate. Yet Donald Trump is 
president, and climate change 
is real. By all means, then, is it 
entirely valid to love a brand for 
its name.

To be grounded in such a lasting 

heritage, something great must 
have happened at the hands of its 
inheritor at one point or another. 
When Karl took the helm at Chanel 
in 1983, the German mastermind 
began cranking out controversial 
collections like it was his job (to 
be fair, it was). When the ‘90s 
rolled around, his taste grew ever 
more 
objectionable. 
High-rise 

bodysuits emblazoned with that 
omnipresent double-C paraded 
down his runway alongside suits 
reminiscent of the matador’s traje 
de luces. As I recount his bold past 
in writing, everything sounds too 
good to have been true (there is 
nothing I would prefer than to 
see a new generation of Cindy 
Crawfords prance across the Paris 
stage in nothing but a hot pink 
Chanel bikini). In the 21st century, 
Karl appears to have focused his 
energy on paying homage to his 
lone successor, an act that has 
become predictable after seasons 

of relative redundancy.

Karl’s 68th couture collection 

for the house debuted this past 
Tuesday. Even before viewing 
the photo gallery on nowfashion.
com, I knew this season’s work 
would 
be 
predictably 
frothy 

and frilly, accompanied by some 
characteristically 
enchanting 

background, but I still counted 
down the minutes until I could 
escape my social science class and 
devour the photos on a “bathroom 
break.”

Look one: A tweed skirt suit 

in a subdued shade of green, 
accented by a black pussybow at 
the neck and a chunky silver belt 
at the midsection. Skirt suit after 
skirt suit, tweed after tweed, 
pastel after pastel, ruffle after 
ruffle. Soon, fully-sequined ball 
gowns were added into the mix, 
not without a generous spray 
of feathers. Spokesmodel Lily 
Rose-Depp closed out the show 
in a gargantuan pink pastry of a 
number. Utterly typical, and yet, I 
drooled over every last detail.

That’s just the Chanel Effect. 

You may not like it, but you still 
have to love it.

CHANEL

Chanel’s latest show for Paris Couture Week

Fred’s makes its return

The empty storefront startled 

me. I didn’t know how to 
interpret the sign on the door 
that read: “Working hard on 
getting reopened and will be 
seeing you all so soon.” It was so 
vague. It was early fall, and I was 
not taking Fred’s disappearance 
well — being told I couldn’t 
have it only made me want it 
more. I checked their Instagram 
(@Fredslol) with regularity and 
impatiently waited for word of 
reopening. When news of their 
January relaunch finally arrived, I 
was elated.

The old Fred’s was a charming, 

shoebox-sized café tucked away 
on South U. The sunny California 
vibe inside was a rupture from 
gray of the street. The aesthetic 
was trendy, but it wasn’t trying too 
hard — it was small and cramped, 
but clean and white.

The new space is similarly cute, 

yet different.

When I entered, it was clear 

that the place was far from its 
humble beginnings. The new 
place gobbled up the old one: 
It’s sprawling. Every inch 
was packed. I opened the 
door straight to a line. What’s 
more, the place was bustling. The 
energy was palpable. Waiters were 
zipping around, swapping trays 
of avocado toast for beautifully 
illustrated number cards.

I have to confess, I despise 

nearly every variety of vegetable. 
However, every January, after 
the onslaught of “clean eating” 
content, I think to myself: “Maybe 
I do like healthy food, maybe it’s 
not that bad.” Unfortunately, that 
message never sticks. Salad just 
does not excite me the way a plate 
of fries does. However, despite my 
distaste for superfoods, at Fred’s 
I cannot help but exchange green 
for greens. Turns out, all I need to 
get excited is a pretty presentation 
— and in that regard, Fred’s excels. 

The food styling is next level where 
every single item on the menu has 
its custumors reaching for their 
phone. You’d be hard pressed to 
find a dish that is not vibrant and 
multi-hued.

Arguably, even more beautiful 

than the food is the café itself; it 
is spacious, light and the décor 
evokes a very West Coast x 
Marrekesh vibe. Long gone are 
the days of the hallway-sized café. 
Unlike before, where the only 
seating was a cramped counter, 
the renovated space now has 
room for dining. Alternatively, 
you can lounge on the plush steel 
blue couch while drinking a latte 
from the coffee bar. If you’re into 
healthy food that doesn’t taste like 
sawdust, or you’re just into taking 
photos of your food (no judgment), 
it’s worth the trip. Fred’s perfectly 
satisfies the gap in the market for 
reasonably priced, casual, clean, 
aesthetically pleasing food and 
is overall a great new (well, half 
new) addition to the Ann 
Arbor food scene.

An ode to the late-night snack

It’s a little after 11 p.m., 

and you just got home from 
the library, a late meeting or 
somewhere or other. You likely 
ate dinner four or five hours 
ago. 
Your 
stomach 
growls, 

reminding you of the stretch of 
time that has elapsed. Perhaps 
you could snack on a bag of 
Goldfish or munch on an apple. 
Neither really fill you up or hit 
the spot, but they’ll do in the 
moment –– until 
you get in bed and 
find yourself already 
thinking 
about 

breakfast.

Maybe 
this 

isn’t you at all. It’s 
possibly 
just 
me 

rambling about my 
late-night 
eating 

habits 
(admittedly 

unbefitting someone 
who loves a good 
meal as much as I 
do). But it makes me 
wonder: What is it 
about that chunk of 
time between the sun setting 
and our bodies following suit 
that makes food a salient, 
nagging thought surfacing in 
our minds?

Though 
termed 
the 

“midnight 
snack,” 
late-

night eating can roughly be 
considered 
eating 
anything 

after our last meal of the day 
and anything before our first. 
It can take various forms, be 
shared with others or alone 
and usually creeps up on us 
in the form of a some random 
craving. Akin to the midnight 
snack is the drunk food, a 
similarly spontaneous act of 
eating anything to satisfy us in 
the moment.

While most people carefully 

devise and prepare their daily 
meals (taken to the extreme by 
myself) –– a habit inherently 
hinged 
upon 
concern 
for 

sustaining our health and well-
being –– there’s rarely, if ever, 
pause or a plan of action that 
motivates our decisive instinct 
to consume a late-night snack. 
It’s a moment of complete, 
uninhibited consumption that 

encapsulates 
the 

frequently 
evasive 

feeling 
of 
total 

freedom.

I say run with 

that freedom. How 
often 
throughout 

the day do we get 
to act with reckless 
abandon? How often 
do we act with such 
carelessness, 
such 

aimless gusto? Our 
limited 
energy 
is 

channeled 
towards 

so 
many 
other 

demands that drain 

us of our ability to scrutinize 
even the most trivial of matters 
that the brief moment in which 
we act upon our hunger without 
thinking twice resolves any 
other nagging thoughts in our 
minds. Though on a small scale, 
the indulgence of a satiating 
impromptu snack seems like 
a blip on our daily radar, it’s 
much more than that.

Our society doesn’t reward 

action without thought, and 
under most circumstances, it 
shouldn’t. 
But 
momentarily 

freeing ourselves from the 
chains of arbitrary, everyday 
choices can be a psychological 
deep breath –– a moment of 
peace.

Whatever 
prompts 
us 

to 
fill 
our 
stomachs 
and 

ease our minds, be it a dull, 
persistent hunger or an aching 
restlessness, 
we 
seek 
out 

comfort in food. And a late-
night snack is the epitome of 
a quick, comforting treat that 
doesn’t require much effort or 
time to attain.

With that, I’ll leave you with 

three of my favorite late night 
snacks: the beautifully random 
concoctions of edible respites 
I find comfort in on any given 
night. 

A bowl of cereal
I know, I know: “Seriously?” 

Yes, seriously. It’s cheap and 
easy. I throw in nuts, chocolate 
chips, coconut flakes, almond 
butter; replace dairy milk with 
almond milk or yogurt or cereal 
with granola. The options are 
endless, easy and satisfying.

Ricotta toast
Sounds fancy, right? Well, 

it’s not. It’s an airy, subtly 
tangy cheese (for under $3 at 
most grocery stores) slathered 
on crisp toasted bread and can 
be assembled in under five 
minutes. If you really want to 
throw caution to the wind, top 
it with sliced fruit, honey, seeds 
or whatever. It’s a blank slate 
for your most foolhardy culinary 
ambitions. The less thought you put 
into it the better and tastier. 

DIY Trail Mix
AKA a crazy person’s bag of 

snacks. Combine pretzels, goldfish, 
peanuts, or anything in your snack 
cabinet with a crunch, and toss 
together. The pleasing variety 
and gratifying textures are a true 
testament to what can be done with 
an offhand spurt of creativity and 
bold indifference.

STYLE NOTEBOOK
Fashion’s great obligation

“Buy less and buy better” — 

that’s what we’re told. In that 
cliché 
narrative, 
consumers 

are the primary targets of 
activists 
focused 
on 
the 

fashion industry’s devastating 
environmental 
effects 
and 

inhumane 
treatment 
of 

workers. The fashion industry 
has cultivated the idea that 
consumers 
hold 
the 
true 

power 
in 
determining 
the 

market’s interaction with the 
environment. If we choose 
to 
buy 
more 
exclusively 

responsible, 
recycled 
and 

reused clothing, then fashion 
corporations will be forced to 
change their wasteful ways and 
cater to an ecological demand. 
Current clothing production 
and distribution poses a myriad 
of all too real problems, from 
the use of non-biodegradable 
material, 
rampant 

environmental pollution and 
exhaustion of fossil fuels and 
freshwater, all to produce over 
80 billion pieces of clothing a 
year. “Fast fashion” simply isn’t 
sustainable. 

But despite the warnings 

and begging of activists, we 
continue to gorge ourselves 
shirt by shirt, breathlessly 
hoping to keep up, be stylish, 
full steam ahead. 

Perhaps 
the 
relationship 

between the fashion industry 
and 
our 
environment 
is 

infinitely 
more 
complex 

than our typical branding of 
the consumer populus, with 
responsibility 
for 
creating 

an ecological demand. The 
decision to shop ecologically 
could have much less to do 
with the individual consumer 
decision and more so with 
the powerhouses of modern 
fashion mandating wear of the 
newest pieces and ideas. The 
worth of any item of clothing 
has been reconfigured — now 

lying in its momentary and 
cheap 
trendsetting 
ability. 

Rather than a quality and fair 
trade make in a U.S. warehouse, 
production is often outsourced 
to an illegal one in Bangladesh. 
 

As the excess builds up, it is 

becoming painfully clear the 
fashion corporations we hold 

in such high regard have an 
imminent moral responsibility 
to 
actively 
implement 

sustainable practices for the 
future of fashion and, more 
pressingly, our environment. In 
cooperation with the everyday 
individual’s effort to consume 
less conspicuously, there is too 
much potential for corporate 
change. Companies like Eileen 
Fisher, Ralph Lauren and Stella 
McCartney have demonstrated 
the potential of an ecological 
business model and set in 
motion 
a 
wiser 
consumer 

impression of what is trendy, 
desirable 
and 
ultimately 

necessary. The company’s 
market 
highly 
regarded 

collections of fairly sourced 
and 
constructed 
clothing, 

encouraging 
the 
spread 
of 

sustainable fashion. Through 
closed 
loop 
technology, 

clothing 
can 
be 
carefully 

broken down for textile reuse. 
Similarly, Swedish engineers 
recently released a garment 
made 
from 
100 
percent 

recycled cotton. For worldwide 
clothing names to implement 
these practices would both 
engage 
the 
impressionable 

public and encourage a far-
reaching 
implementation 
of 

environmental production. 

So for now, keep thrifting, 

re-wearing, 
shopping 

smart and handing in your 
unwanted clothes to recycling 
collections. You never know, 
the 
material 
from 
those 

unwanted clothes could walk 
the runways of Valentino in its 
next life.

 “It’s never been 
more 
impor-

tant that we stick 
together and take 
care of each other.”
As many lament-
ed the dwindling 
hours 
of 
Barack 

Obama’s 
presi-

dency, those were 
the simple words 
Arcade Fire had for 
their surprise single 
release. The release 
wasn’t 
expected, 

nor was it exactly 
sought after. Yet, 
their 
poignantly 

timed new single, “I 
Give You Power,” is 
the perfect answer 
to today’s divisive, 
often 
fragmented 

political 
climate: 

Solidarity is a beau-
tiful 
thing, 
but 

when it engenders 
itself in the face of 
fear? That’s when 
it’s most powerful.
Arcade Fire aren’t 
strangers 
to 
the 

familial, 
either. 

From their letters to 
the suburbs to their 
debut album’s fixa-
tion on “neighbor-
hood,” the band is 
among the notable 
contemporary har-
bingers of commu-

nal artistry — but 
perhaps now even 
more pointedly so. 
Post-election, many 
American 
artists 

have been channel-
ing their thoughts 
and emotions (along 
with their fans’) in 
a variety of ways 

— some muted and 
some raucous, but 
all anchored in the 
same 
sentiment.

For “I Give You 
Power,” 
Arcade 

Fire recruit rhythm 
and 
blues 
main-

stay Mavis Staples 
to orchestrate an 
aurally simple (yet 
contextually grand) 
piece that takes on 
a slightly different 
frame than many 
of their politically 
active 
colleagues. 

In mantric fashion, 
Staples and Win 
Butler — frontman 
for the band — craft 
a carefully-built fer-
vor, with the two 
belting lyrics like 
“I give you power 
/ But now I say / I 
give you power / I 
can take it away” 
over 
and 
over 

again, 
channeling 

the 
extremes 
of 

their past sounds in 
records like Reflek-
tor and Neon Bible. 
Unlike their musi-
cal contemporaries, 
Butler and Staples 
stick to the basics. 
They exchange fury 
for groove, aggres-
sion for simplicity, 
a call to arms for 
a 
simple 
warn-

ing — as easily as 
we give our leaders 
power, we can take 
it away. It’s a sober-
ing reminder in the 
face of the anger 
these 
next 
four 

years risk generat-
ing. We’re all in this 
together — Arcade 
Fire 
ensures 
we 

won’t forget that.

The latest addition to the ‘xXx’ trilogy disappoints.

‘xXx’ a wildly careless feature

What could be better for 

movie-lovers than not having 
to leave the couch to watch 
new 
releases? 
— 
and 
no, 

this is not a public service 
announcement telling readers 
to start Torrenting movies. 
Netflix, which is responsible for 
producing some of the best new 
original series in recent memory, 
is now dabbling 
in movies. Sadly, 
they haven’t been 
as successful in 
this field. With a 
few 
exceptions, 

many of of their 
releases 
receive 

little acclaim or 
attention. It almost feels like the 
movies are treated as though 
they aren’t worthy of theatrical 
releases, so a Netflix release is 
the best alternative to scrapping 
the project all together. Perhaps, 
Netflix movies are becoming 
the equivalent of “made for TV” 
movies when people actually 
watched TV on the TV.

“Take 
the 
10” 
doesn’t 

necessarily fit this mold of 
mediocrity. Although it might 
not be groundbreaking, it never 
feels like a project that was put 
on life support, and Netflix was 
its last dying chance for revival.

Made-for-Netflix 
movies 

could be a way for up-and-
coming directors to get their feet 
wet in the industry, exposing 
new talent to wide audiences. 
Chester Tam (“Popstar”) has his 
directorial debut with “Take the 

10,” while also starring as a drug 
dealer who feels emasculated 
by his girlfriend. Alongside 
Tam is Toni Revolori (“Dope”) 
and 
Nickelodeon 
sensation, 

Josh Peck (“Red Dawn”). Both 
actors 
have 
matured 
since 

their launches into stardom, 
so shedding memories of both 
actors 
as 
their 
adolescent 

selves 
is 
challenging. 
Who 

could forget Revolori’s stellar 
performance as Zero Moustafa 
in Wes Anderson’s “The Grand 

Budapest Hotel”? 
Or, a younger and 
chubbier Peck in 
“Drake and Josh”? 
Nonetheless, 
both 
provide 

strong, convincing 
performances.

In 
fact, 
the 

acting 
makes 
up 
for 
the 

weak dialogue and lazy gags 
throughout the movie, giving 
impressive deliveries to jokes 
that sometimes feel like an 
eighth grader wrote. The film 
focuses on three intertwining 
events 
of 
nonconventional 

criminals breaking the law in 
strange ways. Chris (Peck) and 
Chester (Ravolori) work at a 
parody of Whole Foods —aptly 
titled Wholeish Foods— and 
are planning on going to a rap 
concert in the Inland Empire 
of California. However, when 
trying to sell his car for money, 
things quickly get complicated 
for Chester. Ultimately, the 
Craigslist 
buyer 
steals 
his 

“vintage” 1997 Toyota. On top of 
this, the antagonists always find 
themselves running into Chris 
and Chester in ways that are too 

convenient and unbelievable. 
With a disappointing ending, 
the story of “Take the 10” is not 
its strong point.

Andy Samberg (“Popstar”) 

and Fred Armisen (“Portlandia”) 
make 
brief, 
underwhelming 

appearances. If these minor 
roles weren’t occupied with 
A-list celebrities, their scenes 
would likely fail to gather any 
laughs.

Stereotypes are somewhat 

challenged in the movie, but 
without any subtlety. Most of 
the humor lies between making 
a racist joke and then denying 
that any racist joke was made. 
It’s like hinting that you hate 
a 
friend’s 
haircut 
without 

deliberately saying it and then 
continuing to deny your true 
feelings once the friend accuses 
you of hating it. It never works 
in “Take the 10.”

Although it sometimes feels 

like “Take the 10” has nothing 
going for it, the movie packs a 
lot into its 80-minute duration. 
Essentially, not one minute of 
the movie is dull. “Take the 10” 
isn’t trying to be a breakthrough 
for 
comedy, 
but 
rather 
an 

enjoyable movie to help unwind 
after 
a 
stressful 
day. 
The 

increased desire for mindless 
escapism 
through 
binge 

watching Netflix series is so 
prevalent today, and “Take the 
10” fits the mold. For devoted 
binge watchers looking for past-
paced entertainment, “Take the 
10” will be a welcomed break 
between watching 10 episodes 
of “Orange Is the New Black” 
and “House of Cards.”

FILM REVIEW

That the newest film in the 

“xXx” franchise wouldn’t take 
itself seriously was a given. These 
films have always been targeted 
at those who find the “Fast and 
the Furious” movies too serious. 
“Return of Xander Cage” takes 
it to a different level—it simply 
doesn’t care. It can’t be bothered 
to take anything too seriously, 
least of all its own 
quality or what 
its audience may 
want. Caring is 
for 
“suits” 
who 

don’t know how 
to have fun, and 
all “Xander Cage” 
wants to do is, by 
its own admission, 
“kick some ass, get 
the girl, and try to 
look dope doing it.” Somehow, it 
can’t even do that right.

It almost looks promising 

in its first few scenes, with a 
couple genuinely great stunts, 
a decent sense of humor and 
the impossibly cool Donnie 
Yen (“Rogue One: A Star Wars 
Story”) leading the charge. It 
knows it’s stupid and revels in 
that fact. Then, as if trying to 
break some sort of record, it 
runs that shtick into the ground 
within ten minutes, and apathy 
defines the rest of the affair.

As a result of that indifference, 

the dialogue, acting and half the 
scenes would feel right at home 
in a run-of-the-mill porno. It’s 
not an understatement to say 
that “The Return of Xander 

Cage” may have some of the 
worst dialogue to ever grace the 
big screen, with every character 
constantly saddled with the task 
of delivering the same kind of 
tin-eared, clunky, inane one-
liners over and over again. Half 
of these are bad lines to begin 
with, but the other half are 
ruined by the wooden acting that 
pervades the cast, particularly 
Toni 
Collette 
(“Krampus”), 

who turns in an egregiously 
monotone performance.

When 
the 

heroes of “Return 
of Xander Cage” 
aren’t acting like 
the 
caffeine-

addled 
eight 

graders 
who 

wrote the script, 
they’re partaking 
in the worst action 
scenes 
of 
2017 

so 
far. 
Which 

includes not just the hyper-
choreographed 
hand-to-hand 

combat either which is generally 
saved by Yen’s incomparable 
stunt work –– but also every 
scene with even an ounce of 
excitement. A sequence late in 
the movie, which involves two 
guys chasing after each other, is 
so filled with incomprehensible 
“shaky cam” and poor editing 
that it actually hurts to look 
at. Any hope that these scenes 
could be elevated by a good 
effect is obliterated by effects 
that look, at best, like something 
out of the early nineties.

However, 
many 
won’t 
be 

interested in “Return of Xander 
Cage” because they believe it 
will be a competently made film. 

They’re just looking to have fun, 
and that’s understandable. Not 
every movie needs to be some 
uber-intelligent meditation on 
life provided they at least try to 
create a worthwhile experience 
for their audience. This is where 
“Return of Xander Cage” is most 
lacking. It doesn’t care what 
its audience wants. It doesn’t 
matter if they’re looking for 
competent filmmaking or a 
good time.

Several major plot points 

that change the course of 
the movie happen off-screen 
because the film doesn’t care. 
It brings back elements from 
the previous film, “State of the 
Union,” which even fans of the 
original 
despise, 
because 
it 

doesn’t care. Characters appear 
from out of nowhere so often 
that by the end of the movie, 
the only reasonable explanation 
is that these people have the 
ability to travel through space 
and time. “Return of Xander 
Cage” doesn’t care about being 
a good movie, and it doesn’t 
care about being “fun.” It just 
wants to do its own thing, and 
anybody who has a problem 
with that must not know what 
a good time is.

Yet in its final moments, 

“Return 
of 
Xander 
Cage” 

still has time to treat itself 
like a very special movie. “If 
people would just treat each 
other better, the world would 
be a better place,” it says, 
straight-faced. Considering it 
amounts to a little more than 
one hundred and ten minute 
of audience abuse, the irony is 
incredible.

One hundred: ‘M’ downs Wildcats for Barnes Arico’s milestone

When 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico 

walked into the locker room 
after an 80-54 beatdown over 
Northwestern, 
her 
players 

greeted 
her 
stone-faced. 

Seconds later, water was flying 
in the 
air 
from 
all 
directions and Barnes Arico was 
doused head to toe, everyone in 
the room celebrating her 100th 
win as the Michigan women’s 
basketball coach.

The festivities didn’t stop 

there. 
The 
players 
brought 

out a cake and showed her a 
video montage with messages 
and pictures from current and 
former staffers and players.

“They got me a little bit 

wet,” Barnes Arico joked. “It 
was awesome. I was wondering 
what was going on, and then all 
of a sudden all the water went 
off and a beautiful cake and a 
beautiful video to follow.

“I’ve been really fortunate. 

My first year here I took over 
a team that had a great season 
the year before, really didn’t 
want to lose their coach and 
had five seniors returning. You 
really never know how they’ll 
welcome you at that point. 
They embraced me with open 
arms. … They taught me what 
it was to be at Michigan. We 
really connected from day one. 
It’s been great every year since 
then.”

Barnes 
Arico’s 
feat 
is 

especially 
impressive 

considering she is just over 
halfway finished with her fifth 
season with the Wolverines, 
and already just 23 wins shy 
of becoming the all-time wins 
leader in program history — 
trailing only Sue Guevara, who 
coached the team from 1996 to 
2003.

“I was concerned … any coach 

that tells you they’re not, it’s a 
bunch of bologna,” Barnes Arico 
said. “But the players weren’t. 
(We) played a great team like 
Northwestern that had a week 
off to prepare for us. … As much 
as we scored the basketball, I 
think we really locked in on the 
defensive end and followed the 
game plan.”

Added junior forward Jillian 

Dunston: 
“We 
didn’t 
want 

to jinx it. We were hesitant 
to celebrate. We were telling 
ourselves we had to win tonight. 
Any game in the Big Ten is a big 
game, so we knew we needed 
this win regardless of the 100th 
win or not, and it was awesome 
to get that win.”

While 
the 
team 
will 

surely bask in Barnes Arico’s 
accomplishment — its next game 

isn’t for another week — there 
were plenty of other things to 
celebrate in Michigan’s win.

The Wolverines (6-2 Big Ten, 

17-5 overall) returned to the 
hardwood of Crisler Center for 
the first time since Jan. 15, and 
what was primed to be a close 
contest with NCAA Tournament 
implications turned ugly early.

The Wildcats (4-3, 15-5) made 

the first shot of the game with 
an early layup, but a 3-pointer 
from freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick at the 8:56 mark of 
the first quarter gave Michigan 
a lead it wouldn’t relinquish for 
the rest of the game.

Northwestern’s 
offensive 

troubles began from the get-go, 
as it scored just nine points in 
the first frame. The Wildcats’ 
star forward Nia Coffey was 

hawked 
by 
junior 
forward 

Jillian Dunston, shooting just 
1-for-7 in the first quarter and 
6-for-20 for the game.

“(Our defense) is one of the 

reasons 
we’re 
pushing 
this 

year,” Dunston said. “Screening, 
rebounding, 
giving 
my 

teammates more opportunities. 
… It’s a big role but it’s not 
overwhelming.”

Alternatively, the Wolverines 

shot 8-for-14 — including eight 
points 
from 
Gondrezick 
— 

to end the quarter up, 19-9. 
Gondrezick went on to lead 
the team in scoring, notching 
career-highs of 22 points and 
six 3-pointers to go along with 
seven boards and six assists. 
Junior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
was productive in her own right, 
scoring 20 points and eclipsing 

the 1,700 career point milestone. 
 

“To be able to shoot the ball 

that well gives me a lot more 
confidence moving forward,” 
Gondrezick said. “Being able 
to impact the game whether it 
be scoring, or rebounding or 
passing. ... Being able to come 
out and get that sizeable lead 
was huge for us and gives us a 
lot of momentum.

Things didn’t get any better 

for 
Northwestern 
in 
the 

following period, as it scored 
just 10 points and turned the 
ball over seven times en route 
to a 41-19 deficit at halftime. 
The Wildcats’ 19 points was a 
testament to the defense that 
Barnes Arico praised earlier in 
the week — it was the lowest 
halftime point total for a team 
that averages 73.7 points per 

game.

The 
low 
point 
total 

is 
especially 
impressive 

considering sophomore center 
Hallie Thome sat much of the 
half after picking up a foul 
28 seconds into the game. On 
the other side of the ball for 
Michigan, the team shot a 
gaudy 7-for-13 from beyond the 
arc. Senior point guard Siera 
Thompson also etched her name 
in the records alongside her 
coach, moving to second place 
among Michigan’s career assists 
leaders, with her 489th dime 
coming off a pass to Gondrezick 
for a right-wing 3-pointer.

“As the years have gone by … 

my role has changed,” Thompson 
said. “As a point guard, you have 
to sacrifice some of your game. 
I’m not putting scoring to the 
side, but there’s a lot of stuff I 
had to think about.”

With a lopsided lead heading 

into the third quarter, the 
Wolverines 
were 
more 
lax 

on both sides of the ball but 
did just enough to remain 
comfortable heading into the 
final period with a 21-point lead. 
Despite Northwestern’s height 
advantage, 
Michigan 
limited 

its 
scoring 
opportunities, 

outrebounding 
the 
Wildcats 

in the quarter, 12-6, while also 
forcing seven turnovers.

The 
Wolverines 
showed 

no mercy in the final period, 
beginning the quarter on an 
11-0 run. But even in the final 
minutes of the game, with four 
reserves in the lineup, Michigan 
could still not be stopped, as a 
corner three by senior guard 
Danielle Williams was the final 
nail of many in Northwestern’s 
coffin.

With 
Flaherty 
surpassing 

1,700 points in her career, 
Thompson moving into second 
in program history in career 
assists, Barnes Arico’s 100th 
win and a win over the then-
fourth place team in the Big Ten, 
Michigan can rest easy for now.

Wolverines support Bell Let’s Talk

The phrase is simple — just 

three words.

It’s nearly seven years old 

now, but the importance of Bell 
Let’s Talk hasn’t dwindled since 
it was created by a Canadian 
organization 
dedicated 
to 

erasing the stigma surrounding 
mental illness. The organization 
(which shares the same name 
as the phrase) also seeks to help 
Canadians with mental illnesses 
receive better care and access, 
encourages change by adopting a 
standard for mental health in the 
workplace and raises money for 
research.

Each year on Jan. 25, Bell 

Let’s Talk promises to donate 
five cents for every tweet — in 
addition to other forms of social 
media or communication — that 
includes the phrase in a hashtag.

The 
campaign 
has 
been 

unofficially 
adopted 
by 
the 

hockey community, and that 
has held true for the Michigan 
hockey team.

In past years, most of the 

Wolverines’ 
participation 
lay 

in individual tweets with the 

hashtag from both current and 
former players. This year, though, 
a few Canadian members of the 
team made a collective effort to 
help raise awareness.

In a picture that the team’s 

official account tweeted, senior 
defenseman Nolan De Jong, 
junior forward Dexter Dancs 
and freshman goaltender Jack 
LaFontaine held cards with 
messages 
written 
on 
them 

such as “You are not alone”, 
“A conversation could change 
a life”, and “It’s okay to ask for 
help”.

“The hockey community is 

such a tight-knit group that if 
somebody’s suffering from that 
or takes their life — god forbid 
they do that — it affects a lot of 
people,” De Jong said. “So I think 
there’s always guys that want to 
step up and make a difference 
because there are so many 
people suffering in silence that 
are maybe scared to come out 
and talk about it or are trying to 
battle through it because of the 
stigma that surrounds mental 
health right now. I think it’s 
something that’s getting better, 
but there’s still a long way to go 
with it.”

Some 
Michigan 
players, 

like 
senior 
goaltender 
Zach 

Nagelvoort, 
discovered 

the 
initiative 
through 
the 

organization’s 
social 
media 

campaign. De Jong, on the other 
hand, learned about it while 
following the NHL.

He had grown up familiar 

with the career of Rick Rypien, 
a forward for the Vancouver 
Canucks 
who 
earned 
a 

reputation as a hard-working 
player and enforcer. Rypien 
suffered 
from 
depression 

for most of his career before 
committing suicide in 2011. His 
death shook the hockey world 
and spurred further involvement 
in mental health causes — 
such as Bell Let’s Talk — from 
both players and teams. In the 
aftermath of Rypien’s death, 
two of his former teammates, 
Kevin Bieksa and Alex Burrows, 
worked 
to 
promote 
mental 

health awareness — efforts that 
De Jong became aware of.

“... That’s something that I 

saw a lot of it and something that 
I think touched a lot of people 
in British Columbia especially, 
because Rick Rypien was such a 
well-liked, heart-and-soul team 

guy,” De Jong said. “... (Rypien’s 
suicide) didn’t hurt just the team 
and the hockey community, but 
everybody in British Columbia, 
and that left a lasting effect for 
me, especially.”

Added Nagelvoort: “We see 

these people as immortal. We 
see them as like, ‘Oh, tough 
guy who plays in the NHL, 
there’s no way anything else 
could be going on.’ I think that 
really humanizes it — to see 
someone like that, who plays 
at the highest level that there 
is in our sport, that we all 
idolize, to see that that person 
was affected by a mental health 
issue. … If it happens to one of 
those guys that we hold so high, 
then it probably is happening 
to someone who you’ve played 
with or play with right now.”

The 
drive 
to 
increase 

awareness 
of 
mental 
health 

issues is something both De 
Jong and Nagelvoort are familiar 
with, and it doesn’t just stop with 
Bell Let’s Talk. Both players are 
cognizant of the strides that 
Michigan has taken to expand its 
resources, such as its Counseling 
and 
Psychological 
Services 

program. 

While he hopes his teammates 

would be comfortable talking to 
him about any issues weighing 
on them, Nagelvoort anticipates 
that his teammates would use 
those resources if necessary.

He said himself that the 

stigma 
surrounding 
mental 

illness too often results in silence 
about the issue. 

“I can’t speak for everyone 

else but I grew up in the ‘Put your 
head down, just work harder, if 
you put more hours in on the ice, 
you’ll get through your problems’ 
(mentality),” Nagelvoort said. 
“There’s a lot of people who go 
through life and that’s not the 
only answer.”

Added 
De 
Jong: 
“... 
It’s 

definitely a positive to see 
so many student-athletes or 
professional athletes taking a 
stand and showing that, you 
know, we may have to put on this 
face and go out there, but there’s 
other things in our lives that 
affect us rather than just making 
sure I perform on the ice.”

Dunston shines on D

Junior forward Jillian Dunston 

hasn’t had an easy job the past 
couple games. The Michigan 
women’s basketball team has 
assigned her the task of shutting 
down the opposing team’s best 
player each night. On Wednesday 
night, Dunston proved her worth, 
once again, as a defensive stopper 
during the Wolverines’ 80-54 win 
over Northwestern. 

“My body hurts from guarding 

all these All-Americans,” Dunston 
said with a laugh.

Dunston has marked up against 

two of the best players in the Big 
Ten over Michigan’s past two 
contests: first against Nebraska’s 
sophomore 
forward 
Jessica 

Shepard, and then Northwestern’s 
senior forward Nia Coffey.

By all accounts, Michigan’s 

matchup against the Wildcats was 
supposed to be a close game. The 
Wolverines are third in the Big Ten 
standings, while Northwestern 
was sitting only one spot behind 
them, tied for fourth.

Yet, as the score indicates, 

Michigan pulled away early, with 
a 12-3 lead in the first five minutes 
and never let the Wildcats catch 
up. And according to Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico, it was 
because of Dunston’s effort.

“I just think we locked in on the 

defensive end,” Barnes Arico said. 
“They’re led by an All-American 
candidate in Nia Coffey, and 
Jillian Dunston… had her 1-for-10 
at the half. Just really incredible.”

Coffey averaged 19.6 points 

coming into the faceoff against 
the Wolverines. But with Dunston 
shadowing 
her, 
she 
finished 

with an inefficient 16 points, 
shooting just 6-for-20 on field 
goal attempts. Dunston’s previous 
experience guarding Shephard 
contributed to her success against 
Coffey.

“Prior, we played Nebraska,” 

Dunston said. “And it was a 
similar game plan, where their 
power forwards are their most 
powerful players, and I knew I 
had to match up with them. But 
my teammates helped me a lot. 
Like a lot, a lot.”

Not only did Dunston stick to 

her mark like glue, but she was 
all over the paint too, grabbing 
14 rebounds — just one shy of 
her career high. Rebounds have 
been a huge focal point for the 
Wolverines this season. Dunston 
has taken that mentality to heart 
and encourages her teammates to 
do the same.

“When it comes to rebounding, 

Jillian’s on me all the time,” 
said 
freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick, 
who 
had 
seven 

rebounds of her own against the 
Wildcats.

Added Barnes Arico: “She has 

really become one of the best 
defenders in our conference with 
what she’s been able to do. She’s 
one of the best rebounders on our 
team. … She’s our emotional leader 
for sure.”

While she seems to have 

defense down pat, there were 
a few times that Dunston was 
afforded opportunities to take 
more offensive control against 
Northwestern. 
Wide-open 

behind the 3-point line more than 
once, she passed the ball off to a 
teammate instead of taking a clear 
shot.

Dunston, while consistent 

on defense, scored just four 
points.

“Sometimes I pass too much 

or I’m too passive,” Dunston said. 
“I need to be a threat in order to 
create for my teammates. It’s 
kind of a paradox, of creating, not 
creating too much, creating for 
yourself, but not being selfish.”

Even though there is room 

for 
improvement 
offensively, 

Dunston’s 
defensive 
game 

is 
arguably 
responsible 
for 

Michigan’s two latest wins. For 
now, she plays the exact role that 
the Wolverines need her to, and 
has worked hard to improve on it.

“She has had a lot of tough 

assignments,” said senior guard 
Siera Thompson. “Especially the 
last few games. But she has taken 
the challenge and she’s been in 
the film room studying the other 
players’ moves. We’re so proud of 
her, because a couple years ago we 
didn’t know if she would be able to 
take on that challenge and we’ve 
seen the growth in her.”

Greg Frey to join Michigan staff

It 
appears 
the 
Michigan 

football team will be filling its 
vacancy on the coaching staff 
with a familiar face.

According to a report from 

Sam Webb of The Michigan 
Insider, Greg Frey will be 
returning to Ann Arbor as both 
the offensive tackles/tight ends 
coach and run game coordinator.

Frey previously served as 

Michigan’s offensive line coach 
from 2008 to 2010 under Rich 
Rodriguez. This time around, 
his hire fills the opening on 
the Wolverines’ staff created 
by former running backs coach 

Tyrone Wheatley’s departure 
for the Jacksonville Jaguars.

While it was assumed that a 

running backs coach would be 
hired to fill Wheatley’s spot, 
it appears that Michigan will 
shuffle its staff around in some 
manner — Tim Drevno has been 
the offensive line coach for the 
past two seasons and has also 
been the offensive coordinator, 
while Webb reported that Jay 
Harbaugh — previously the tight 
ends coach — will become the 
running backs coach. 

Frey brings a wealth of 

experience to Ann Arbor. He 
began his coaching career at 
South Florida, where he was 
the offensive line coach for 

seven years. He spent one year 
at West Virginia before moving 
to Michigan with Rodriguez in 
2008.

At Michigan, Frey teamed up 

with Rodriguez to coach what 
was eventually one of the most 
potent offenses in the nation. In 
2009, the Wolverines’ rushing 
offense averaged 186 yards per 
game and was ranked No. 25 in 
the nation, while the unit as a 
whole was ranked No. 59 in total 
offense. They improved both 
marks the following year to No. 
13, at 238 yards per game, and 
No. 8, respectively.

At Michigan, Frey earned a 

reputation as someone who had 
an eye for offensive line talent. 
Under his tutelage, David Molk 
won the Rimington Trophy — 
given to the nation’s best center 
— in 2010, while players who 
Frey recruited and coached 
such as Taylor Lewan, Michael 
Schofield and Patrick Omameh 
eventually reached the NFL.

After Rodriguez was fired 

following 
the 
2010 
season, 

Frey caught on at Indiana. He 
has served as the Hoosiers’ 
offensive line coach for the past 
six years and the co-offensive 
coordinator 
since 
2014. 

Indiana’s offense reached new 
heights with Frey coaching the 
offensive line. The Hoosiers, 
whose 
rushing 
attack 
was 

predicated on inside zone runs, 
averaged over 200 yards on the 
ground for three consecutive 
seasons between 2013 and 2015. 
Frey coached two All-American 
offensive linemen in Dan Feeney 
and Jason Spriggs and will be 
called upon to develop the same 
type of talent in Ann Arbor.

Michigan rushed for nearly 

213 yards per game last year 
behind a veteran offensive line 
that featured left tackle/guard 
Ben Braden, right guard Kyle 
Kalis and right tackle Erik 
Magnuson. All three seniors 
will be gone next year, though, 
leaving 
just 
two 
returning 

starters in junior center Mason 
Cole and sophomore left tackle 
Grant Newsome, who suffered 
a season-ending injury against 
Wisconsin.

Behind Enemy Lines 
with Thomas Bryant

On Thursday, the Michigan 

men’s 
basketball 
team 
will 

welcome Indiana into Crisler 
Center for the two teams’ first 
matchup of the season.

After a slow start to the Big Ten 

season that saw the Hoosiers go 
1-3, Indiana has responded with 
three straight wins, including 
a 
seven-point 
victory 
over 

Michigan State last Saturday.

With guard Yogi Ferrell gone 

to the NBA and forward OG 
Anunoby recently suffering a 
right knee injury that will keep 
him out for the rest of the season, 
Hoosier center Thomas Bryant 
has assumed an even bigger role 
on the team.

While 
Bryant 
is 
shooting 

almost 17 percent worse than he 
did last year, he is still averaging 
11.9 points per game and his 
rebounding average has increased 
from 5.8 to 7 rebounds per game.

The Daily sat down with 

Bryant at Big Ten Media Day 
in October to discuss Bryant’s 
decision to pass on the NBA Draft 
and return to Indiana, playing 
with Ferrell and the Hoosiers’ 
tough non-conference schedule.

The Michigan Daily: You had 

a chance to jump to the NBA last 
summer. What do you think of 
the new rule that allows players 

to test the waters before jumping 
into the draft?

Thomas Bryant: I think it’s 

great. It’s great for players to go 
out there and test the waters and 
get the feedback from NBA scouts 
on what they need to improve on, 
what they do well. Every college 
basketball player’s dream is to 
make it to the NBA, what better 
way to get feedback than from 
NBA personnel?

TMD: What were the biggest 

factors that led you to go back to 
Indiana for another year?

TB: I knew I needed to get 

better. There’s some key things 
I needed to get better at, and I 
knew staying would actually help 
me get better at those things.

TMD: 
You 
mentioned 

conditioning earlier as one of 
those things, but in terms of X’s 
and O’s, what do you want to get 
better at?

TB: I feel like I could be better 

on both ends of the court and 
being more versatile and more 
vocal out there on the court.

TMD: Now that you’re in your 

sophomore year, what did you 
learn from your freshman year 
and how can you take that into 
your second year at Indiana?

TB: Just the mindset that I 

need to have about playing college 
basketball. It’s a lot different than 
high school, and you just have to 
have that mental mindset and 

there’s a mental toughness that 
you need to have on the court.

TMD: 
Yogi 
Ferrell 
has 

been somewhat of a villain for 
Michigan fans over the past 
couple of years. What was it like 
playing with him last year?

TB: It was great. He knew a lot 

about the game, and he brought 
the most out of his teammates 
each and every day. Whether it 
was in practice or in a game, he 
was a real leader.

TMD: 
Your 
team 
was 

undefeated at home at Assembly 
Hall last year. What will it take 
to go undefeated again there this 
year? (Indiana is currently 12-2 at 
home with losses to Nebraska and 
Wisconsin.) 

TB: We need to have the 

same mindset that we had last 
year, especially on the defensive 
end. We have to have a pitbull 
mindset 
on 
the 
defensive 

end because our defense will 
transform our offense into a 
great offense.

TMD: You have a pretty tough 

schedule to open up the year with 
games against Kansas and North 
Carolina. Are you excited to play 
the better teams in the country?

TB: Oh yeah. We look forward 

to playing the better teams in 
the country. We like that. All we 
want to do is play great, top-notch 
teams. We’ll take that with open 
arms.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Wolverines beginning difficult
stretch with Indiana matchup

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team has been doing 
its own kind 
of dance this 
year.

It 
seems 

that for every 
step 
the 

Wolverines 
take forward, 
they 
take 

another 
one 

backward. But 
as 
Michigan 

enters 
the 

crucible 
of 

its 
Big 
Ten 

schedule, the 
room for anything but progress 
is dwindling quickly.

Within the next 21 days, 

the Wolverines will play both 
Indiana and Michigan State 
twice, while also facing off with 
Ohio State before wrapping 
up the tough stretch with a 
rematch 
against 
Wisconsin. 

And the journey through that 
gauntlet all begins with a 
matchup against the Hoosiers 
at Crisler Center on Thursday 
night.

“We’re 
definitely 
in 
the 

heart 
of 
our 
(conference) 

schedule now,” said senior wing 
Zak Irvin. “We have a great 
opportunity to be able to put 
ourselves in a great position in 
the Big Ten and also to be able 
to get a NCAA Tournament bid. 
We’ve got to take these games 
seriously, 
especially 
against 

an opponent like (Indiana), 
Michigan State, Ohio State 
coming up.”

Added Michigan coach John 

Beilein: “… Now when you go 
into the mid part of the season, 
I think people know that you 
can’t keep losing games and 
expect to be in the hunt at the 
end of the year in your league or 
in the NCAA Tournament.”

If there were ever a good time 

for Michigan to face Indiana, 
it’s now.

After 
entering 
the 
year 

as the defending conference 
champions 
and 
favored 
to 

compete 
for 
another 
Big 

Ten title, the Hoosiers have 
struggled more than expected. 
To make matters worse, it 
was announced last Friday 
that sophomore forward OG 
Anunoby will be out for the 
year with a right knee injury.

With 
Anunoby’s 
injury, 

Indiana will be without their 
fourth-highest 
scorer 
and 

second-highest 
rebounder 

when it faces the Wolverines.

Still, center Thomas Bryant 

is a consistent threat down low 
for the Hoosiers, averaging a 
team-high seven rebounds per 
game with 11.9 points to boot. 
Bryant has been a major factor 
in Indiana’s current three-game 
win streak against Rutgers, 
Penn State and Michigan State.

Indiana will be a threat on 

the perimeter as well, as it ranks 
No. 34 in the nation in three-
point field goal percentage, 
led by guard James Blackmon 
Jr. who is coming off a show-

stopping performance against 
the Spartans in which he scored 
33 points on 11-for-16 shooting.

As Michigan prepares for 

the Hoosiers, Blackmon will 
certainly be on its radar.

“We believe that some guys, 

if you let a guy just get it going, 
as you know there’s a mindset 

to that,” Beilein said. “There’s a 
zone people get in. If they can 
get into it, I don’t care who’s 
guarding them. … You try to 
get him (away) from doing that 
by not making the mistake of 
giving him a clean look to get 
himself going.” 

The Wolverines, in their own 

right, have shown encouraging 
signs as of late. After being 
dominated in the post against 
Illinois on Jan. 11, Michigan 
showed signs of tremendous 
progress 
against 
Wisconsin 

and in its rematch against the 
Fighting Illini.

The 
Wolverines’ 
front 

court 
duo 
of 
sophomore 

Moritz Wagner and redshirt 
sophomore DJ Wilson managed 
to limit Wisconsin forwards 
Ethan Happ and Nigel Hayes’ 
impact until falling prey to foul 
trouble.

Then Michigan’s big men 

built off their performance at 
the Kohl Center. In the rematch 
at Crisler Center on Saturday, 
Fighting Illini center Maverick 
Morgan and forward Leron 
Black mustered just 10 points. 
When the teams originally met, 
the Illinois duo got the better of 
the Wolverines, combining for 
26 points. 

The 
Wolverines 
have 

struggled to string together 
performances like that since the 
beginning of the season. And as 
they prepare to face Indiana, 
finding consistency could be 
the difference between a win 
and a loss.

“This is a long season,” 

Beilein said. “You just can’t get 
too up, you can’t get too down. 
You’ve gotta enjoy the season 
and enjoy your year, but you’ve 
gotta attack every game like 
it’s your last game, because 
anything can turn a game, and 
any game can turn a season 
around. That’s gotta be our 
mentality and I think it is right 
now.”
