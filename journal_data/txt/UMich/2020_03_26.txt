As students leave campus at 

a rapid pace in accordance with 

University of Michigan guidelines, 

some are worrying about the last-

minute move-out costs as well as 

services from the University they 

have already paid for but will no 

longer be able to use.

University Housing sent an email 

on Friday announcing that students 

who move out of the campus dorms 

by March 25 will receive a refund 

of $1,200. A petition calling on 

the school to cover the costs of 

“unplanned 
travel 
and 
moving 

expenses” had more than 1,700 

signatures as of Wednesday night.

While the Friday email entails 

how to receive the refund, the 

question of refunds for student 

meal plans remained unanswered. 

However, Steve Mangan, senior 

director of MDining, wrote in an 

email to The Daily that the refund 

University Housing is offering for 

$1,200 includes the unlimited meal 

plan.

“All students living in Campus 

Housing, who have moved out and 

left campus, have been offered a 

$1200 refund for their Housing and 

Dining plan for the Winter semester,” 

Managan wrote. “Due to the variety 

of options for off-campus meal plans, 

refunds for students with Optional 

Meal Plans are being evaluated 

and we will be reaching out to each 

Optional Meal Plan holder in the 

near future.”

Students planning on receiving 

the 
University 
Housing 
refund 

should not expect to receive an 

additional refund from MDining. 

The email from University Housing 

states the refund will come from the 

University Housing contract, which 

includes a meal plan selection. 

LSA freshman Ari Richardson 

lived in East Quad Residence Hall, 

which reported a case of COVID-

19 among one of its cooks last week. 

Richardson said she was unaware 

the 
University 
Housing 
refund 

included the meal plan, adding that 

MDining should have given options 

to students regarding their meal plan 

due to the different circumstances of 

student housing. 

Since 
summer 
2019, 
Porter 

Hughes, 
LSA 
freshman 
and 

co-founder of Students for Bernie 

at the University of Michigan, has 

spent hours knocking on doors, 

phone banking and offering rides 

to and from local polling stations 

in support of the presidential 

campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, 

I-Vt.

Hughes also helped organize 

Sanders’s rally in Ann Arbor in 

March. The event featured the 

senator and U.S. Rep. Alexandria 

Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY.

“I’ve been working on the 

campaign since August, but I 

started my training over the 

summer in July,” Hughes said. 

“Students for Bernie at UMich 

was started in September and has 

been working for the campaign 

since then as well. We worked 

to promote Bernie on campus by 

holding events such as canvasses, 

phone banks and the rally with 

Bernie and AOC.”

Other 
campus 
organizations 

supporting 
political 
campaigns 

— whether in support of national, 

state or local politicians — have also 

put in effort in trying to get their 

candidates elected by connecting 

to voters face-to-face. 

But now traditional methods of 

campaign mobilization have been 

either upended or called off due to 

the recent outbreaks of COVID-19, 

a pandemic sweeping the U.S. and 

the rest of the world. 

In the U.S., the number of 

individuals testing positive for 

COVID-19 has risen to more than 

59,000 cases and more than 300 

deaths as of Wednesday, making 

the U.S. third highest in number 

of confirmed cases, as of Sunday. 

More than 158 million Americans 

are 
now 
mandated 
by 
state 

governments to stay at home in 

an effort to slow the spread of the 

disease. 

In Michigan, the number of 

cases has spiked to more than 2,000 

across the state as of Wednesday.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., 

held her third telephone town hall on 

Wednesday to answer questions from 

constituents regarding the most recent 

developments on the coronavirus, 

including the relief package that was 

negotiated by the U.S. Senate earlier 

that day and passed Wednesday 

night, and the resources available to 

constituents in District 12. 

Congress has already passed two 

smaller coronavirus bills to help 

bolster the economy, but the third is a 

nearly $2 trillion package that aims to 

help stabilize the U.S. economy in the 

months to come. 

Dingell talked with constituents 

alongside 
Carolyn 
Wilson, 
chief 

operating officer and executive vice 

president at Beaumont Health, and 

Romy Ancog, the regional export 

finance manager at the Small Business 

Administration in Detroit. 

Dingell opened by emphasizing the 

importance of staying home and how 

everyone is needed to help stop the 

spread of the coronavirus. 

“This is real and diligence on the 

part of everyone is needed right now, 

and this is not a partisan time,” Dingell 

said. “The number one priority besides 

PPE (personal protective equipment) is 

to address this health crisis. It requires 

a Marshall Plan that we have to keep 

our health care infrastructure strong, 

and we are going to have to rebuild it to 

ensure that the resources are there to 

test and treat everyone who needs it.” 

Wilson noted that many cases of 

COVID-19 are mild, and symptoms — 

which can include fever, fatigue and 

dry cough — can often be managed 

without seeking medical care. 

“Most people do very well with their 

management of these symptoms at 

home,” Wilson said. “There is a minority 

of patients who do require intervention 

if those symptoms get moderate or 

severe and we would encourage you if 

you do have mild symptoms to stay at 

home and quarantined as the governor 

has asked us to do.”

Ancog discussed the focus of the 

SBA during this time and encouraged 

small business and nonprofit owners to 

apply for loans. 

“(We are focused on) how it can 

help business owners get through 

this very difficult time,” Ancog said. 

“These loans are available for any small 

business or nonprofit whether it was 

affected directly or indirectly by this 

virus.” 

Dingell also acknowledged the need 

to “flatten the curve,” or slow the 

spread of the virus enough to ensure the 

nation’s hospitals are not overwhelmed. 

“If we’re going to take the peak and 

lower it, we have to get to a hump and 

that means we have to stop going out 

and it’s really hard, but we have to do 

that,” Dingell said. 

“The bill that we hopefully will get 

more details on tonight — Schumer 

called it unemployment on steroids — 

part of it is going to try to fully replace 

wages for four months.”

Representative Debbie Dingell held her third telephone town hall Wednesday evening. This photo was taken when Dingell previously spoke with sup-
porters to kick off the Michigan Democratic Jewish Caucus at the Pretzel Bell in February.
Dingell provides updates on 
federal response to COVID-19

US representative hosts telephone town hall to discuss efforts to stop 
spread of virus, tells constituents ‘We cannot have a panic right now’

Now, the spread of coronavirus 

and growing concerns about how the 

nation’s hospitals will handle the strain 

have fueled calls for Medicare for All 

among some activists and politicians.

According to El-Sayed, one of the 

primary goals of passing Medicare for 

All is to prevent catastrophes like the 

COVID-19 pandemic from causing 

damage on a national level.

“Our responsibility is to articulate 

the future that is set in the past we 

wish we had,” El-Sayed said. “One 

where we had been able to address 

this, one where we could have been 

able to stop this.”

El-Sayed, an alum of the University 

of 
Michigan 
and 
former 
health 

director of Detroit, is a prominent 

proponent of universal health care, 

has discussed Medicare for All widely 

in various interviews, podcasts and in 

his upcoming book “Healing Politics: A 

Doctor’s Journey into the Heart of Our 

Political Epidemic.” He is a longtime 

proponent of the policy. During his 

2018 
gubernatorial 
campaign, 
he 

proposed 
MichiCare, 
single-payer 

health insurance covering all Michigan 

residents.

On Wednesday, El-Sayed outlined 

the ways in which Medicare for All 

would benefit Americans, pointing 

to the failure of the nation’s current 

health care system to adequately 

respond to the outbreak of coronavirus. 

“Whenever you have a public good, 

if you run the public good poorly, it’s 

poor,” El-Sayed said. ”If you defund 

the public good, it’s bad. I don’t want 

folks to fall for the trick of ‘Oh look, 

they’ve got a public system and look 

how bad it’s failing.’ Well, we’re two 

weeks away from seeing what the 

consequences of our system are, and 

it’s going to be awful. I wish we never 

had to see it, but we’re going to see a lot 

of these images.”

With respect to the COVID-19 

pandemic, El-Sayed criticized the 

current health care system’s handling 

of the situation.

“Our 
current 
pandemic 
is 

substantially worse because there are 

10 percent of people who are, in effect, 

locked out of health care,” El-Sayed 

said. “Coronavirus creates a very non-

specific set of symptoms. You know 

how many other diseases cause a fever 

and a dry cough? Almost everything 

that people suffer from this time of 

year. So if you’re sitting there, and even 

if you have insurance but your health 

care is behind a deductible, you’re 

saying ‘Well look, alright, so I can get 

tests paid for but if I don’t have COVID, 

then I’m not going to get my care paid 

for and I’m going to have to pay for it. 

So maybe I just won’t.’”

El-Sayed also viewed the current 

pandemic and its implications for 

Medicare for All through a political 

lens, discussing the implications the 

COVID-19 virus may have on the 

passing of favorable legislation in the 

future.

“We’re talking about a mass 

trauma that we are all experiencing 

right now, and that’s terrible,” 

El-Sayed said. “But every time 

someone has to go bankrupt for their 

cancer care, every time someone 

who gets really sick can’t see a 

doctor — that’s a mini tragedy on 

its own. And even though it’s not 

collectively experienced, let’s not 

undersell the cost that that has on 

those individuals and the fact that 

it’s happening to 10 percent of our 

population or 42 percent of people 

who have cancer.”

El-Sayed 
emphasized 
the 

importance of preventative care 

over reactive care, stating the ways 

in which it would cut costs overall. 

“One of the most important 

aspects of Medicare for All is that 

it streamlines the incentive set to 

prevent disease, which reduces 

health care costs over the long-

term,” El-Sayed said. “And because 

it’s the government, the only real 

intended outcome is, rather than 

making money off the system, 

to promote the well-being of the 

population.”

El-Sayed explained the way in 

which American insurance and 

medical systems currently work.

“One of these things we’ve seen in 

this system is this crazy amount of 

consolidation on either side,” he said. 

“The biggest hospital groups or the 

biggest payers are able to negotiate 

to consolidate the market around 

themselves, in effect creating local 

oligopolies or even monopolies.” 

El-Sayed further critiqued the 

American 
health 
care 
system’s 

current 
market 
structure. 
He 

explained the ways in which it does 

not display the traits of the free 

market championed by members of 

the American public and critics of a 

single-payer healthcare system. 

“The problem with American 

health care, and health care in 

general, is that you don’t actually 

know what you want,” El-Sayed 

said. “You have a deep information 

asymmetry. I walk in, and I know 

I’m sick and I know I want the 

sickness to go away, but I don’t know 

what I need to make the sickness go 

away.”

During this discussion, Rackham 

student Rebecca Copeland asked 

El-Sayed about the implementation 

of a sweeping policy like Medicare 

for All. 

“Something that I think a lot 

about when I think about Medicare 

for All is how a lot of the services 

and general operation of a program 

like this would be contracted out to 

private contractors because that’s 

how most of the (Affordable Care 

Act) implementation is happening,” 

Copeland said. “I was wondering 

what your thoughts were on that 

and how you see something like this 

being implemented.”

Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 

declared a state of emergency 

on March 10 after the first cases 

were detected in Michigan. 

Whitmer 
has 
since 
banned 

gatherings of more than 50 

people, closed all schools and 

public spaces and restricted 

hospital visits. Whitmer also 

put a shelter-in-place order into 

effect beginning March 24. 

Other 
states, 
including 

California, 
New 
York 
and 

Illinois, 
have 
also 
issued 

similar orders. With Americans 

unable to leave their homes — 

unless in cases of emergency 

— campaigns have been forced 

to shut down campaign rallies, 

face-to-face town halls and 

canvassing events.

“This 
was 
in 
nobody’s 

playbook,” Hughes said. “It kind 

of took everyone by surprise. It 

required 
some 
maneuvering, 

and I’m really proud of our team 

in being able to pick up where 

we left off.”

Both Sanders’s and former 

Vice 
President 
Joe 
Biden’s 

presidential 
campaigns 
have 

mandated that staffers work 

remotely. 
Field-organizers 

will continue campaigning via 

digital platforms such as phone 

banking and mobile updates. 

Both 
candidates 
have 
also 

shifted to conducting “virtual” 

town halls and broadcasting 

their speeches remotely. 

Biden has switched all of his 

efforts to online campaigning, 

recently holding a virtual town 

hall in Illinois that was stopped 

fifteen minutes into questions 

due to technical difficulties. He 

has also held a virtual fundraiser 

and plans to continue virtually 

campaigning amid the COVID-

19 outbreak. 

Andrew 
Schaeffler, 
LSA 

freshman 
and 
co-founder 

of Students for Biden at the 

University, said the campus 

organization plans to readjust 

its efforts to support Biden by 

working remotely and focusing 

on virtual campaigning.

“We can’t have a presence on 

campus, but that doesn’t mean 

that we’re not doing everything 

we 
can,” 
Schaeffler 
said. 

“There’s still virtual campaign 

events that are happening, that 

our members are participating 

in. And (this crisis) just goes 

to 
show 
that 
when 
you’re 

dealing with these problems 

as president, you don’t want 

someone that needs on-the-job 

training. And I think that for 

many voters, that will be the 

deciding factor.”

President Donald Trump has 

also had to adjust his campaign 

due 
to 
the 
outbreaks. 
He 

recently postponed or canceled 

events in Colorado, Nevada and 

Wisconsin. Trump has also 

called for all of his campaign 

staffers to begin working from 

home and has canceled all 

in-person rallies and events 

until further notice. 

Students for Trump did not 

respond to The Daily’s request 

for comment. 

Down-ballot campaigns have 

also had to scramble to find 

alternative ways of engaging 

voters that do not jeopardize 

an individual’s health or safety. 

Some have halted campaigning 

entirely for the time being 

while some have switched to 

more 
virtual 
outreach 
and 

campaigning. 

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 

D-Mich., 
who 
is 
up 
for 

re-election 
in 
November 
in 

Michigan’s 12th Congressional 

District, spoke to The Daily 

about 
halting 
her 
current 

campaign efforts for the time 

being to focus on serving her 

constituents to the best of her 

ability. 

“I don’t think (campaigning) 

is a priority,” Dingell said. 

“I’ll have to figure it out down 

the road. But now, I’m not up 

there saying, ‘vote for me.’ I 

don’t think it’s appropriate to 

ask people to vote for you right 

now. I’ve been very focused on 

making sure everyone’s okay. 

What are we going to do to 

make sure that people are safe? 

My campaign will come back 

up again in a few weeks. My 

job is to represent the people of 

my district, to make sure I can 

do everything I can to fight for 

them.”

Solomon 
Rajput, 
Dingell’s 

opponent in the Democratic 

primary, has moved all of his 

campaign operations online and 

ordered his staff and volunteers 

to work remotely from home. 

Rajput spoke to The Daily about 

the 
importance 
of 
keeping 

voters engaged by helping to 

put to the forefront what issues 

voters care about most. 

“You know, this isn’t just a 

regular campaign,” Rajput said. 

“We do need to make sure that 

we are doing what we can to 

improve people’s lives during 

this crisis. (We are) able to 

really focus in and rally around 

(the issues) people will be facing 

during this crisis and are trying 

to help people through that and 

let people know that we’re here 

to champion their issues … I 

think it’s important for people to 

demonstrate their commitment 

to materially improving the 

lives of Americans.” 

Marianne 
Drysdale, 
LSA 

senior, is working to re-elect 

Sen. 
Gary 
Peters, 
D-Mich., 

who is up for re-election in the 

fall She serves as co-president 

for Students for Gary Peters, 

a student group that is not 

directly affiliated with Peter’s 

campaign but has still focused 

its energy on supporting his 

candidacy. 

She 
said 
in-person 

interactions play an important 

role in campaigning.

“Things have really, really, 

really 
changed, 
because 
in 

organizing the most effective 

way to transition a conversation 

into a vote is through in-person 

interaction,” 
Drysdale 
said. 

“And for us, campaigning now 

is probably going to be mostly 

using 
our 
personal 
digital 

networks and reaching out to 

other people that we know to 

use their digital networks. So 

it’s a completely different kind 

of strategy.”

As campaigns have struggled 

to adjust to life amid the 

coronavirus, 
the 
general 

election itself could also be 

affected. 
States 
across 
the 

country have already begun 

to 
postpone 
their 
primary 

elections set to take place in 

March or April to later in the 

summer.

“No one really can predict 

what the world will look like 

in November,” Drysdale said. 

“Because there’s scenario A, 

which is people aren’t worried 

about (the election). People 

are more worried about their 

dire economic circumstances 

or about exiting the house. Or 

scenario B is that people are 

really frustrated with the status 

quo of our federal leadership or 

people are feeling all the more 

empowered to be keeping up 

with the news … I don’t think 

that anybody really has the 

capacity to be able to predict 

exactly what’s going to happen.”

Rajput 
also 
noted 
the 

uncertainty.

“We can’t even see two weeks 

out right now,” Rajput said. 

“Everyone’s just taking this 

day by day … I think what is 

paramount to our country and 

also thousands of individuals 

is to ensure that everyone is as 

healthy as possible.”

Reporter Julia Forrest can be 

reached at juforres@umich.edu. 

“I believe that students should 

have the option to either have 

them refunded or carry over 

into the next year,” Richardson 

said. “Because then you’ll have 

seniors who aren’t going to use 

them anytime soon and already 

paid for this. If you don’t get it 

back, that’s just the University 

taking money.”

Richardson 
also 
said 
her 

primary concern with MDining 

was about her leftover Blue 

Bucks and Dining Dollars.

“My main problem when it 

was time to leave was that I had 

a bunch of Dining Dollars and 

Blue Bucks leftover,” Richardson 

said. 

While 
Blue 
Bucks 
are 

refundable and automatically 

transfer from year to year, 

MDining is still evaluating its 

options in regard to Dining 

Dollars.

Students who had optional 

meal plans should expect to 

hear from MDining about their 

individual 
circumstances, 
as 

each case will be evaluated for a 

refund. 

LSA sophomore Alec Bayoneto 

lives off-campus but has the 55 

Block optional meal plan. This 

plan costs $1,432 for the fall 

and winter semesters, and when 

Bayoneto left campus, he said 

he had 17 unused meal swipes 

left. As of Wednesday, Bayoneto 

said he has not received any 

emails from MDining regarding 

a refund for his optional meal 

plan. 

“I 
know 
that 
we’re 
all 

struggling right now to handle 

everything,” Bayoneto said. “If 

they reimburse us, that would 

be one less thing to worry about 

right now with readjusting to the 

way things are with everything 

that’s going on. For plans like 

mine, you can see how many 

swipes you would’ve had left. 

It’s about $12 a meal, so they can 

just easily total that up and give 

you back an exact amount.” 

LSA 
freshman 
Dominic 

Colletti 
also 
lived 
in 
East 

Quad. Colletti said he was 

glad University Housing was 

reimbursing 
students 
but 

questioned the logic behind the 

amount they were offering. He 

speculated the prorate for the 

room alone would be close to 

$1,200 at the cheapest rate and 

said many students are not on 

the cheapest rate for room and 

board.

“I think there’s absolutely no 

reason not to prorate. It’s a little 

trickier because, with housing, 

everyone’s already signed their 

contract and already paid with 

dining,” Colletti said. “It gets 

a little trickier with students 

who 
have 
off-campus 
meal 

plans because a lot of them 

have used a lot of their meals 

… I can foresee that being more 

complicated, but unlimited meal 

plans should be just prorated 

plain and simple. Divide the rate 

by however much time is left in 

the contract.”

Students who are staying in 

the dorms should not expect any 

change in the price of their meal 

plans. According to Mangan, 

changing the meals from dine-

in service to take-out boxes does 

not interfere with their ability 

to provide meals during the 

week and on the weekends.

“Michigan Dining continues 

to provide breakfast, lunch and 

dinner every day with brunch 

and dinner being provided on 

Saturday and Sunday so there 

will be no change in meal 

prices,” Mangan wrote.

Richardson said even though 

everyone is working to adjust to 

extreme new changes, she thinks 

University services still need to 

be accountable to students.

“I understand that a lot of 

departments in the University 

are 
scrambling 
to 
figure 

out what to do and we’re all 

struggling, 
but 
that 
doesn’t 

take away from that fact that 

there’s still a program that has 

a responsibility to provide for 

the students,” Richardson said. 

“So when they can’t provide 

meals anymore, we should be 

compensated in some way.”

D 

ue to a pandemic-that-

must-not-be-named, 

many people have found 

themselves quarantined in their 

homes. This new window of free 

time can be looked at as a unique 

opportunity to try new things. 

Perhaps, you can finally read 

all of those untouched books on 

your shelf, start exercising, learn 

to bake, watch that show you’ve 

been meaning to get to on Netflix. 

While I am a big proponent of 

trying new things, I also strongly 

recommend 
revisiting 
things 

you’ve experienced in the past.

Re-reading, 
re-watching 
or 

even re-listening to something is 

often looked upon as a complete 

waste of time. Why give up time 

that could be spent discovering the 

millions of untouched materials the 

cybersphere or your dust-collecting 

bookshelf can doubtlessly provide? 

To me, however, there is something 

uniquely peculiar about revisiting 

old work; it’s because we never 

experience the same thing twice. 

When I reopen a book, which I 

regularly do, I am never reading it 

exactly the same way. I’m a new 

me with new experiences, new 

memories and quite possibly, a new 

perspective which will reshape my 

views of the work. This same idea 

applies to movies, television and 

music.

It goes without saying that 

our current predicament forces 

us to reconsider parts of life that 

we’d previously taken for granted. 

Many of us have been faced with 

new questions and begun to look 

at life differently. These lenses — 

quite possibly glazed with fear, 

apprehension and hope — can 

offer us the irrefutably magical 

opportunity of revisiting fictitious 

worlds with a new point of view.

Why, however, should you spend 

your time re-entering a world when 

you could instead be somewhere 

completely new? In times of 

stress, revisiting a work can be less 

overwhelming or daunting a task 

than tackling something completely 

different. The words seem familiar 

or comforting, like a weighted 

blanket, and the characters feel 

like old friends. With each piece of 

dialogue, description or downbeat, 

you may just feel a little more OK 

than you did before. I, of course, 

am not a doctor, psychologist or 

person qualified to assess anxiety or 

frustration. 
Instead, 
I 
speak 
from 
my 

own personal experience. However, 

there have been studies that support 

my claims about the benefit of 

repeat experiences. In his study, 

“Enjoy it again: Repeat experiences 

are 
less 
repetitive 
than 
people 
think,” 

psychologist Ed O’Brien discusses 

measured enjoyment levels of 

repeat experiencers. “Repetition,” 

he claims, “could add an unforeseen 

spice to life.”

Harry Potter and Hermione 

Granger were there to comfort 

me 
when 
the 
ACT 
seemed 

unconquerable. John, Paul, George 

and Ringo serenaded me 

through college acceptance and 

rejection letters. Now, through this 

uncertain and inexplicable time, 

Lorelai Gilmore has helped me keep 

calm and attack this new reality, 

clever quip by clever quip.

We revisit the same songs again 

and again — they become a huge 

part of our identity. The same should 

be said for the longer works in our 

lives; books, movies and television 

define our interests and can speak 

to our perspectives, ideologies or 

priorities in an even greater way. 

Through 
this 
process 
of 
rediscovery, 

we find new ways to connect with 

people.

Even in isolation, we can 

revisit, expand and reinforce old 

connections made the first time 

we experienced a certain book or 

movie. Who were you dating? Who 

were your friends? What were your 

priorities? 
How 
has 
that 
all 
changed? 

Maybe a connection you’ve made 

in this past year has forever altered 

the way you feel during “To Kill a 

Mockingbird” or how you pity “The 

Godfather.” There are so many new 

entrances 
and 
hallways 
and 
windows 

within the doors you have opened in 

the past. Find them, walk or climb 

through and open them. In addition 

to all of the new tasks and books and 

shows in your queue, try applying all 

of this newness to something your 

brain 
will 
remember. 
It 
may 
surprise 

you how new it may seem. 

I 

n deeply embedded systems of 

oppression, the most basic elements 

of human rights are stripped 

away. The right to plan your family size. 

The right to drink water without being 

poisoned. The right to get life-saving 

medication without bankrupting yourself. 

These issues are obvious in unstable and 

undemocratic developing countries. But, 

they also hit extremely close to home.

In 
political 
systems 
marked 
by 

corruption, high violence and extremism, 

there is a festering wound that is often 

overlooked. The rights of the affluent are 

prioritized above all else; elections are 

blatantly rigged, the wealthy can bribe 

the police and afford exemplary lawyers 

to further benefit themselves in the legal 

system. Challenges to the status quo of 

government are “extreme” or “too radical,” 

even when the statement is as harmless 

as a social media post. Those who are not 

prioritized by the state must be silenced, 

or at the very least, disempowered in 

order to maintain an unchecked system 

that protects a small number of specific 

people (tied by class, family ties, religion or 

race). This can be executed by the state in 

multiple ways.

In authoritarian regimes, freedom 

of the press and freedom of speech are 

typically the first things to be eliminated, 

like in China, where the infectious and 

potentially fatal COVID-19 originated 

before spreading across the globe. The 

restrictive policies that prevent people 

from speaking about their experiences, 

fears and challenges directly contributed 

to the slow spread of information about the 

virus, highlighting how domestic human 

rights policy abroad impacts our domestic 

well-being. 
Governments 
sometimes 

progress from illegitimate (dictatorships 

and extreme citizen suppression) to 

legitimate (a government with some 

available representation of citizens). In 

this process, the powerful politicians and 

entrepreneurs have to earn some respect 

from those that work for (and are always 

beneath) them, in order to keep their 

power.

After 
the 
American 
Revolution, 

the founders had to reckon with a few 

challenges. 
These 
challenges 
came 

primarily from non-land-owning white 

men. In order to stop violent uprisings (like 

Shay’s Rebellion), the powerful threw the 

disgruntled a bone 80 years later — giving 

them the right to vote. Despite what we 

know and understand as an obvious flaw 

in democratic liberty, at the time, these 

white men were depicted as radical. While 

their concerns were included in political 

discourse, other disenfranchised groups 

(African Americans, immigrants, women 

and the intersections of these identities) 

were still forced into cultural silence 

through subordinating and dehumanizing 

systems like race-based chattel slavery and 

disenfranchisement through strict voting 

laws.

Over time, as states become stronger, 

the affluent and powerful have to mitigate 

more challenges. When abolitionists (and 

other grassroots movements) had clawed 

their way into political discourse, forming 

voting blocs dedicated to the end of slavery, 

the issue many faced had to be reckoned 

with. When white women and working-

class white men came to personal terms 

with the atrocities of slavery — which 

African Americans had been traumatized 

by since the 1500s — the affluent and 

powerful were forced to find a solution, 

nearly tearing the country in two. In 2020, 

the impact of slavery on generations of 

African Americans is easily understood 

as a horrific human rights violation. But 

before slavery was abolished, abolitionists 

were depicted as radical. The barriers 

that exist today, upheld by past race-based 

chattel slavery, are swept aside.

As mobility, progress and change begin 

to occur and restrictions are lifted — for 

example, the fight for gay rights demanding 

media representation — and as individuals 

who are hurt by the political, economic 

and social limitations enforced by the 

government finally gain a say, they see a 

glimpse of what the affluent and powerful 

have always had. This movement led to the 

majority’s basic tolerance of their humanity, 

which then led to the acceptance of their 

legal ability to marry who they love. Now, 

the adoration of a handful of white gay icons 

(Ellen Degeneres and Pete Buttigieg) have 

worked for their recognition. Once these 

political, economic and social freedoms are 

actualized for some, they justifiably want 

to keep their sense of autonomy, affluence 

and power. Sadly, the legal restrictions 

and oppressive policies that they have 

progressed from still have a firm grasp on 

non-white LGBTQ+ members who face 

disproportionately higher rates of violence. 

Despite the expection of marriage as a 

human right, for centuries, any display of 

LGBTQ+ affection was depicted as radical. 

Today, the legacy of those barriers that 

many still encounter today is ignored.

Human rights issues are prevalent in 

every country. In China, the suppression 

of free speech contributes to the spread 

of a complicated and deadly virus across 

the globe, while the continued lockdown 

and persecution of the Uigher Muslims 

renders them specifically vulnerable to 

COVID-19. In the United States today, 

racialized 
immigration 
policies 
are 

leaving children in cages without their 

parents or basic supplies to support 

themselves. In the U.S. today, polling 

places with high amounts of minority 

voters are closed despite massive lines. In 

the workplace, LGBTQ+ Americans are 

fired because of their sexual orientation 

or gender identity. Any state-enforced 

policy that strips people of their basic 

humanity, from their right to live to their 

right to critique the government on social 

media, isn’t an attack on one group alone. 

It’s an attack on everyone, whether it is 

immediately apparent or not.

It is unfair to argue that fighting for 

fundamental human rights is radical, and 

the fear of social ostracization should 

not prevent privileged citizens from 

advocating for a progressive candidate. 

Those of us who are lucky enough to 

be able to vote because of the resilient 

and heroic actions of those before us — 

those deemed radical, unreasonable and 

idealistic — need to vote. Rather than 

pointing fingers at international human 

rights limitations, American voters must 

first reconcile with the historic and 

present-day oppression, discrimination 

and dehumanization in their own country. 

Not just for ourselves, but for everyone. 

While the freedom of speech, political 

participation and financial security may 

finally be in our grasp despite centuries 

of discrimination, we must use what we 

have fought for to help our neighbors, not 

just ourselves. And this applies to those 

currently in power, too — continue to 

silence and dehumanize others, and you 

will have serious moral and pragmatic 

fissures to mend. In 2020, vote from a 

place of hope for humanity versus the fear 

of its failures, and with the understanding 

that human rights are not, and have never 

been, radical.

MUSIC REVIEW

When my friend told me Donald Glover 

dropped a new album, I immediately sought it out 

on Spotify and couldn’t find it. The long-awaited 

Childish 
Gambino 

project 
materialized 

on 
a 
mysterious 

website, 
https://

donaldgloverpresents.

com, on March 15. My 

friend joked that Glover 

uploaded the album on 

accident 
before 
taking 

a nap — a very probable 

explanation, but Glover’s 

move felt very deliberate.

It’s not out of character 

for Glover to drop projects 

without warning. The very nature of the release 

(unannounced, on a less than conventional 

streaming platform that loops over and over 

again) deeply affects the listening experience. 

The traditional song markers — a tracklist, titles, 

timestamps, beginnings and endings — are 

blurred and mystified. Every song stands on its 

own, but the presentation meshes them into one 

cohesive entity. This continuity in presentation 

organically comes from the sound. Traditional 

progressions between verses, choruses and 

bridges aren’t as predictable, with each song 

progressing or stagnating sporadically. This 

album very literally chugs, squacks, vibrates, 

echoes and chirps as the bass lines play out 

over bright synths, creating a pleasant volatility 

throughout. 

There are still traditional glimmers of song 

formality on this project, but the departures take 

precedence. Most notable is the appearance of 

“Feels Like Summer,” an easygoing, upbeat 2018 

single. Ironically, this album’s artistic departure 

harkens back to “This is America,” a 2018 single 

that didn’t make the cut for this project. An 

ad-lib-heavy, satirical critique that tethers Black 

American art to Black American suffering, the 

track sent ripples across Internet communities 

that immediately dissected the thematic 

underpinnings of its video, lyrics and all the 

connections in between. Similar to “This is 

America,” Childish Gambino strives to unsettle 

his listeners with the connection between his 

music and its presentation. 

One week after its premiere and subsequent 

disappearance, the album now resides on 

traditional streaming platforms with the title 

3.15.20, named after the date it was released. 

The name of each song runs in tandem with the 

album title, each a mere timestamp of when the 

song begins. This is with the exception of songs 
 

“Algorhythm” and “Time.” My initial thinking 

for singing out these two tracks started with the 

fact that “Algorthym” was part of a two-song 

bonus collection that was randomly distributed 

alongside purchases for Glover’s “This is 

America Tour.” Yet this theory didn’t hold as I 

listened to a minimally modified “Feels Like 

Summer” that appeared as “42.26.” In terms of 

“Algorthym,” it beeps, boops and glitches like 

a cyborg and chugs with the weight of its over-

production (kind of like Muse’s Simulation 

Theory, but actually palatable). Nonetheless, 

the track is dynamic, developed and catchy 

enough to garner lasting 

attention from listeners. 

Blossoming from wispy 

synths, it grows with 

layered, 
chugging 

808s reminiscent of a 

packaging 
machine. 

The beat subsides with 

Glover’s 
oscillating 

falsettos and autotuned, 

robotic vocals. Its chorus, 

an 
interpolation 
of 

Zhane’s 1993 hit “Hey 

Mr. D.J.” is self-aware of 

what’s happening in the background; Glover 

upends the R&B Duo’s version to make the lyrics 

come off as more tongue-in-cheek, mocking the 

derivative or “algorthym-ic” nature of dance 

music: “Everybody (Everybody), move your 

body, now do it (Now do it) / Here is something 

(Ooh), that’s gonna make you move and groove.” 

The track ultimately gives way in the end to 

a catchy overlapping of falsetto and altered 

vocals the halt abruptly as the instrumentals 

malfunction — perhaps indicating a clash 

between authenticity and artificiality.

“Time” picks up from here and rebuilds the 

lost beat from the straggling, struggling beeps at 

the end. “Time” is clunky like its predecessor, but 

sweeter, more voluminous and diverse. Every 

drum beat is decipherable and synthesizers 

are faint but laser focused. The vocals are 

pumped up and bright, mingling well with the 

meditative, jangly guitar base. “Time” builds off 

of manifold genres, borrowing elements from 

’80s synth pop, gospel and funk. The Ariana 

Grande feature is uncharacteristically short 

but aesthetically sufficient for another layer of 

sweetness. Despite the leaping variations and 

textures, the song never feels overwhelming, 

developing gradually across its relatively slow 

pace. The track balances its saccharine nature 

against Glover’s contemplative and critical 

character given the stark nature of its lyrical 

commentary. “Maybe all the stars in the night 

are really dreams / Maybe this whole world ain’t 

exactly what it seems / Maybe the sky will fall 

down on tomorrow / But one thing’s for certain, 

baby / We’re running out of time,” Glover croons 

in the chorus. As he wrestles with the ulterior 

meaning of what is abundant and impermanent, 

Glover conveys the reasoning for this track’s 

merit of a title; reality and time are orderly and 

artificially constructed, much like a traditional 

album.

FILM NOTEBOOK

Villians in film: The good, 
the bad and Severus Snape

A lot of people glorify heroes. They help 

people, do good and save the world. And 

that’s true; they deserve a lot of praise 

for all the good that they try to do. But in 

all honesty, would they even be heroes if 

villains didn’t exist? Someone or something 

has to cause a problem or do something 

that will make another person stand up 

and decide to become a hero, which is why 

I think villains deserved to be discussed 

and, dare I say, glorified just as much as 

heroes.

One of the most common misconceptions 

about villains is that they all fall under 

the same category: the bad guy. This 

could not be more incorrect. I think the 

best way to categorize and understand 

villains is by looking at the scale of Hero, 

Vigilante, Antihero and Villain. The term 

Hero is pretty self-explanatory: It refers 

to the person who saves the day. But the 

other terms get a little more complicated. 

A Vigilante, for example, is a person who 

decides to become something similar to 

an authority figure or a member of law 

enforcement without getting actual legal 

authority. A Vigilante tries to do good and 

fight crime, but without authority figures 

backing him, they’re often chased down 

by law enforcement. Batman is a perfect 

example of this. He risks his own life on 

multiple occasions to protect Gotham, 

but because he chooses to operate in the 

shadows and act as an intimidating figure, 

most of the Gotham City Police Department 

is after him constantly. 

The Antihero is probably the most 

complicated term of all because it’s always 

in a gray area. An Antihero is neither good 

nor bad, hero nor villain. Antiheroes are 

typically understood to be protagonists 

or central characters that don’t have 

stereotypical “good guy” qualities. I’ve 

always thought that this explanation was 

incredibly vague, so I came up with my own 

distinction for Antiheroes: characters who 

think that the ends justify the means. This 

could mean that they either do the wrong 

things for the right reasons or do the right 

things for the wrong reasons. 

An example of the former would be 

Albus Dumbledore. This might be a 

surprise to many of you, because by all 

accounts Dumbledore is the token “good 

guy” — the mentor who Harry relies on. 

But even though his end goal was to do 

the right thing by stopping Voldemort, 

Dumbledore made a lot of awful decisions. 

He constantly did the wrong thing to 

defeat Voldemort, such as keep secrets 

from Harry. Granted, he is more heroic 

than many other Antiheroes, but he did 

make mistakes that were unforgivable. 

On the other end of the Antihero falls 

Severus Snape. I’m not much of a Snape 

fan myself, but I can admit that in the 

end, he did the right thing by being a spy 

for the Order of the Phoenix and helping 

Harry defeat Voldemort. But he did none 

of these good things for the right reasons. 

He did everything in Lily Potter’s name. At 

first, that sounds like it would be okay, but 

then you remember that the only reason 

he turned to Dumbledore was for her, not 

because he actually wanted to fight for the 

good side. He had absolutely no problem 

in letting James and Harry die as long as 

Lily was saved. Not to mention that he was 

cruel to students, mere children, when he 

had no right to be. So yes, Snape may have 

been important in defeating Voldemort, 

but does that really mean he was a Hero? 

No. He did what he did for himself, not for 

anyone else.

And finally we get to the Villain. Villains 

are often known as the characters whose 

evil actions are most central to the story, 

the characters who cause problems for the 

Heroes. This is also pretty broad, but it 

makes sense. The Villain does bad things 

because he wants to. And what better 

Villain to discuss than the Joker? In my 

mind, Joker is the epitome of the Villain. 

He just likes to wreak havoc and hurt 

people and cause problems for Batman 

to solve. He also rarely gets any material 

out of his evil. In “The Dark Knight,” the 

Joker literally burns a stack of money to 

prove that, for him, doing evil isn’t for 

any material gain. For him, evil is a state 

of being that he enjoys. He likes to do evil. 

Sure, he may have a tragic backstory, but 

in the end, the Joker just likes to be bad, 

which is why he is one of the best examples 

of a Villain. 

I know that many of my examples are 

subjective, but to me, the characters that I 

mentioned embody each of these categories 

and their respective traits. Morality in 

general is a subjective concept, but that’s 

okay because it makes watching and 

talking about movies and their characters 

so much more interesting. Good and evil 

fall on a scale as well, just like the scale 

of Heroes to Villains. No one person can 

be perfectly good or perfectly bad. Even 

the most honored Heroes have dark sides, 

and the most vile Villains have soft spots. 

Obviously the scale of good and bad is 

meant to be arguable; what fun would it be 

if it weren’t?

As you can probably tell from my byline, I’m 

The Daily’s community culture columnist. As 

I wrote in my application two years ago, my 

column focuses on “the intersection between 

history, culture and the performing arts.” I’ve 

spent the past two years analyzing performances 

I’ve attended in Ann Arbor and beyond. I’ve 

written about everything from “Mean Girls” to 

“Le Marteau sans Maître.”

But two weeks 

ago, the performing 

arts 
industry 

began to change. 

It began with late 

night shows taping 

without audiences 

and concerts being 

live-streamed from 

empty concert halls. 

The 
University 

made plans to limit 

concert attendance 

while 
continuing 

some 
School 
of 

Music, Theatre & 

Dance events.

By the following 

week, the entire 

industry was shut 

down. 
Broadway 

was dark, Coachella 

was 
postponed 

from 
April 
to 

October. 
The 

Metropolitan 

Opera canceled the remainder of its season 

and lost $60 million as a result. The University 

canceled all concerts and events of any size 

before locking the rehearsal and performance 

facilities under the governor’s order. 

As I sat in my childhood bedroom trying 

to write this column — the University having 

all but demanded that students leave campus 

— I struggled to write another column about 

recent performances and trends I noticed in the 

performing arts. It felt as though entire concert 

seasons, entire productions, had been canceled 

in a period of two short weeks.

At the beginning of March, I was excited for 

the premieres of three of my creative works. I 

was also excited for countless performances by 

and premieres from friends across the country 

that I planned on attending. At this point, one 

week from the end of March, every one of these 

performances has been canceled or postponed 

indefinitely.

I had plans to attend a summer music festival 

and intern with a professional performing arts 

organization. My internship has been canceled 

outright; the status of my summer festival 

remains uncertain. For those friends who are 

about to graduate, jobs in the performing arts 

industry are disappearing. 

Trying to write a column about the 

performing arts this week — trying to find 

anything, in essence, to take issue with or 

comment on — seemed disrespectful. The entire 

industry seems to be in free fall, the bottom not 

yet in sight. Any issues I might have with specific 

works or performance practices felt trivial.

It’s not as though we haven’t seen performers 

and performing arts organizations attempt 

to respond to this 

crisis. 
Hundreds 

of performing arts 

organizations have 

moved 
much 
of 

their creative work 

to the realm of 

online 
streaming. 

Audiences 
at 

home can watch 

performances 

by 
most 
major 

orchestras 
and 

operas 
free 
of 

charge. And more 

performers 
have 

taken 
to 
various 

online services to 

share their artistic 

work that I could 

possibly 
try 
to 

recount 
in 
one 

sentence.

Last 
week, 
I 

was 
touched

Laura Benanti share a tweet from MUSKET 

producer Alexandra Niforos about “The Wiz,” 

MUSKET’s canceled production of the semester. 

These rounds of cancelations have served as 

a great equalizer, relegating artists from high 

school to the professional world, at least for the 

time being, to social media.

And though these social media posts may 

be fun, the outlook for the entire community 

remains bleak. The Metropolitan Opera faced 

significant backlash recently after it sent 

fundraising emails to soloists it had just laid 

off. While the specifics of this case may seem 

hypocritical — as of now, the organization’s 

administrative staff continues to be paid while 

musicians and performers are not — the end 

result is the same: Everyone is struggling to stay 

afloat. This epidemic has, in the space of two 

weeks, dragged most of the performing arts 

community underwater.

“I got people for that shit.” Abbreviating 

the phrase to PFTS, Kevin Gillepsie, one of the 

contestants in the new season of “Top Chef: All 

Stars,” says he has his own kitchen staff in his 

restaurants who perform the menial kitchen 

tasks that the contestants are now expected to 

perform on the show. For the show’s contestants, 

many of whom have their own restaurants, PFTS 

is the overarching sentiment of the new season 

— a competition filled with tasks resembling the 

kitchen grunt’s stress-filled trip down memory 

lane. 

You, the viewer at home, might use PFTS 

when you receive something that you personally 

dislike but know of others who would appreciate 

that item. The season premiere of “Top Chef: 

All Stars” is one of these items: an anxiety-

inducing, tumultuous start that is occasionally 

problematic.

Competition cooking shows typically attract 

the enthusiastic, young 

and cocky journeymen 

and industry-hopefuls 

of the culinary trade. 

The current season of 

“Top Chef” provides 

a twist — allowing 

competitors 
(but 

not the winners) of 

previous seasons to 

claim their own Top 

Chef title alongside 

a 
cash 
prize 
of 

$250,000. The talent 

pool is particularly 

strong: Many of the 

competitors, 
after 

their initial losses on 

the show throughout 

the seasons have become celebrated chefs in 

their own right. Some, such as Gregory Courdet 

and Karen Akunowicz, have even earned the 

coveted James Beard Award for Best New 

Restaurant. 

Yet much of the prestige and gravitas of these 

accolades is immediately stripped away with the 

season’s first Quickfire Challenge — a mise en 

place race of coring artichoke hearts, supreming 

oranges and deshelling almonds, a contest that 

will ultimately determine the composition of 

the three groups for the next round. As many 

of the contestants rush through the contest, the 

judges, in particular Tom Colicchio, critique the 

overall messiness of many of the contestants’ 

final products. Much of the critique focuses on 

several contestants’ rustiness toward preparing 

the ingredients on hand — the contestants 

who manage to create passable or even cleanly 

prepared final products do not get much time in 

the spotlight. Bravo’s editors instead choose to 

linger on those who create sloppy deliverables 

instead.

And then, as if on cue, comes the PFTS 

comment. Yet in the context of the Quickfire 

Challenge, you may find PFTS to be a flimsy, 

catch-all fallback to any shortcoming that a 

contestant may face throughout the remainder 

of the season. 

You’ll find there is little drama that unfurls 

among the contestants — something the editors 

at Bravo try to substitute with dizzying flurries of 

jump cuts and close-up shots of the contestants’ 

hands prepping their dishes. Most of the drama is 

a result of technical errors: Errors you might find 

unacceptable in the confines of your own home 

may become understandable in a restaurant or 

competition setting. Not splashing liquid oil on 

an open flame may seem like a no-brainer to 

many, but it can be easy to be oblivious when 

your fish fillets, meant to be served among the 

greatest culinary heavyweights, are aggressively 

sticking to the unseasoned beach grill.

If you are to be particularly discerning, you 

may bristle at both 

the show’s insidious 

labeling and defining 

of “Asian” cuisine. An 

“Asian” aioli called so 

only due to its usage 

of citrus juice and fish 

sauce, another “Asian” 

aioli 
spiked 
with 

miso, parmesan and 

a hibiscus ponzu are 

consumed by a judging 

panel, all of whom 

(aside 
from 
Padma 

Lakshmi) are not of 

Asian 
descent. 
For 

many of these sauces 

who are created by 

contestants who, aside 

from Lee Anne Wong and her miso aioli, are not 

East Asians and then subsequently are critiqued 

by a non-East Asian panel raises a subtle 

question. Who are the creative voices and talents 

who have the power and privilege to create, 

showcase and define East Asian ingredients, 

and who with power and privilege can judge 

these dishes and ingredients? These are heavy 

questions to consider, and not questions that a 

show with levity and American-centric ideals 

such as “Top Chef” can answer.

But ultimately, the “Top Chef” premiere 

offers an exhilarating peak of a show in which 

passionate culinary creatives continually hone 

their craft by competing amongst each other 

under the watchful eyes of Tom Colicchio, 

Padma Lakshmi and Gail Simmons. This is the 

show you would recommend to those who enjoy 

watching the spectacles of action and conflict 

flash upon their screens.
