GREEK LIFE

Sigma Alpha Mu 
reprimanded by 

nationals for causing 

extensive damage

By AMABEL KAROUB

Daily News Editor

The Sigma Alpha Mu national 

office has suspended the Uni-
versity’s chapter after several of 
its members reportedly caused 
thousands of dollars worth of 
damage at a northern Michigan 
ski resort over the weekend.

The Sigma Alpha Mu frater-

nity caused $50,000 worth of 
damage at Treetops Resort in 
Gaylord, Mich., according to the 
resort’s manager. Members from 
several other University Greek 
Life chapters also caused dam-
age at Boyne Highlands, a ski 
resort in Harbor Springs, Mich.

Thursday evening the Uni-

versity released the names of 

five additional Greek Life sorori-
ties and fraternities allegedly 
involved in the incidents at the 
Treetops Resort or Boyne High-
lands over the weekend.

The chapters at Treetops 

Resort were the fraternity Sigma 
Alpha Mu and the sorority Sigma 
Delta Tau. At Boyne Highlands, 
fraternities Pi Kappa Alpha 
and Chi Psi and sororities Delta 
Gamma and Alpha Phi were 
present. The University is cur-
rently investigating the involve-
ment of these members in the 
damage at the resorts.

In the statement, University 

spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald 
said the suspension of SAM 
would include meetings, chapter 
events, philanthropy, recruit-
ment, 
candidate 
education, 

social activities and other Greek 
life activities on the Ann Arbor 
campus.

Greek Life is asking the national

The University of Michigan 

Health System is expanding 
urology services to Flint.

UMHS announced Monday it 

will begin providing specialty-
level urology consultations and 
care to patients at a new clinic 
in Flint beginning Jan. 28. The 
clinic will be housed within the 
Hamilton Community Health 
Network.

According to the press release, 

the clinic will operate on the 
fourth 
Wednesday 
of 
every 

month. John Stoffel, associate 
professor of urology, and John 
Wei, professor of urology, will 
alternate seeing patients.

In the statement, Michael Gia-

calone Jr., chief medical officer 
at Hamilton Community Health 
Network, said he was satisfied 
with the new partnership.

“I’m very pleased that the 

U-M Department of Urology has 
decided to locate their new clinic 
in our facility,” he wrote. “Now 
— in addition to the many other 
medical, dental, vision, and 
pharmacy services we already 
provide — we’ll also be able to 
connect patients who have com-
plex urologic conditions with 
Michigan’s world-class experts 
who specialize in these areas.”

The University’s urology clin-

ic is ranked 14th in the country 

by U.S. News and World Report, 
and the University’s urology 
residency program was recently 
ranked 7th in the country by 
physicians on Doximity, a net-
working website for physicians.

The clinic where UMHS will 

operate is a Federally Qualified 
Health Center, a place for indi-
viduals who are under-insured 
or uninsured. It has already 
hosted University students doing 
internal medicine rotations, as 
well as a University OB/GYN.

UMHS is partnered with 

over 20 other health systems 
and medical practices across the 
state, offering specialty outreach 
clinics. The clinic at HCHN is 
one of a number of recent part-
nerships for UMHS, the most 
notable of which is the alliance 
with Allegiance Health, signed 
in late 2013.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily Thursday, Wei 
said UMHS expansion is good 
for the state because it provides 
more treatment options for resi-
dents.

“Geography is important for a 

number of reasons, one of which 
is that the University has a lot of 
expertise that elsewhere in the 
state, they don’t have,” he said. 
“This isn’t the first time we’re 
reaching out. A lot of this is also 
just doing the right thing for peo-
ple. It kind of is, in some sense, 
just doing good.”

Wei will see more male 

patients on average, while Stof-
fel specializes in working with 
female patients, though the 
two do switch from time to 
time. Urologic conditions that 
will be treated include benign 

University alum’s 
donation to advance 
stem cell research, 
search for a cure 

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

A few years ago, University 

alum Brooke Kendrick pursued in 
vitro fertilization to conceive her 
first child. Now, her excess embry-
os are helping researchers study 
the neurological disorder adreno-
leukodystrophy.

Kendrick, a carrier of the dis-

order, was able to prevent her son 
from being born with ALD through 
in vitro fertilization. The process 
allows the physician to detect the 
embryos that carry the disease and 
separate them from the healthy 
embryos, which are then used for 
conception.

Rather than disposing the dis-

ease-affected embryos, the Ken-
dricks decided to donate them 
through the ALD Foundation to 
the University’s MStem Cell Labo-
ratories. Kendrick said she and her 
husband wanted to let the public 
know about ALD and contribute to 
the search for a cure.

“I wanted to do whatever I 

could to help, to educate people on 
it,” Kendrick said. “And the best 
possible outcome came from this, 
I mean they were able to use the 
embryo to derive the cell line and 
could figure out why children get 
it.”

ted disease that damages nerves 

Congresswoman 
hopes to create 

new jobs, improve 
education funding

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

With only a few weeks in 

Congress under her belt, U.S. 
Rep. Debbie Dingell (D–Mich.) 
has several initiatives planned.

Dingell hopes to help create 

new jobs in Michigan, boost the 
middle class and improve high-
er education during her term, 
she said in an exclusive inter-
view with The Michigan Daily 
Thursday.

Dingell took over her hus-

band John Dingell’s seat in 
Michigan’s 12th Congressional 

District, which includes Ann 
Arbor, two weeks ago when 
the 114th session of Congress 
commenced. Dingell is the first 
woman to succeed her husband 
in Congress while he is still liv-
ing.

She emphasized that in every 

position she has held during her 
career, she has always been a 
woman leader in a male-dom-
inated atmosphere, forcing her 
to work hard to overcome the 
stereotypes associated with 
that dynamic. This session 
there are 84 women in the U.S. 
House out of 435 seats.

“I’ve been someone that’s 

always out there that’s trying to 
ensure that women are treated 
equally,” Dingell said. “I’ve 
worked just as hard — some-
times I feel like I’ve had to work 
three times as hard — than the 
person next to me.”

To aspiring female leaders, 

Dingell said it was important 
for women to work together 
with one another, adding that 
the younger generation does a 
better job than women in her 
generation.

As a representative, she 

identified several legislative 
priorities for the upcoming 
term, including creating new 
jobs and continuing to build the 
economy in Michigan. A former 
vice chairman of the General 
Motors Foundation and execu-
tive director of Global Commu-
nity Relations and Government 
Relations at GM, she specifical-
ly noted a desire to help diver-
sify Michigan’s economy.

“While the auto industry has 

been the backbone of Michi-
gan’s economy, we need to 
try to attract new industries,” 

Gov. Snyder to 
propose plans 
to address fiscal 

shortfall in February

By JACK TURMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

A few days after Republican 

Gov. Rick Snyder’s State of the 
State address, the Snyder admin-
istration has turned its attention 

to the budget.

Last week, the House Fiscal 

Agency projected a $454.4 mil-
lion deficit in the state’s general 
budget due to an unexpectedly 
high number of businesses cash-
ing in previously allocated tax 
credits. A later estimate released 
by the state’s Budget Director 
John Roberts reported the pro-
jected deficit was $325 million for 
the state’s general fund for 2015.

Along with a smaller projected 

shortfall in this fiscal year’s bud-
get, net general fund revenues are 

now projected to be $532 million 
short of what officials expected 
for the 2016 fiscal year.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Thursday, Rep. 
Adam Zemke (D–Ann Arbor) 
said the implications of the defi-
cit aren’t clear yet, but the state 
has to be cautious in using the 
general fund due to its flexibility.

“It’s something that we can 

shift money around,” he said. “It’s 
unclear for sure what is going to 
happen at this point.”

However, Zemke, the vice 

chairman of the House Educa-
tion committee, said some leg-
islators are pushing to ensure 
higher education funding will not 
see a large loss and will be main-
tained at adequate levels.

Dr. Michael Boulus, execu-

tive director of the Presidents 
Council, State Universities of 
Michigan, expressed similar sen-
timents in an interview Thurs-
day.

Boulus said it’s difficult to 

know where Snyder will make

Ruler sought to 
modernize and 
fought al-Qaida

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) 

— Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah, 
the powerful U.S. ally who fought 
against al-Qaida and sought to 
modernize the ultraconservative 
Muslim kingdom, including by 
nudging open greater opportuni-
ties for women, has died. He was 
90.

More than his guarded and 

hidebound predecessors, Abdul-
lah assertively threw his oil-rich 
nation’s weight behind trying to 
shape the Middle East. His prior-
ity was to counter the influence of 
rival, mainly Shiite Iran wherever 
it tried to make advances. He and 
fellow Sunni Arab monarchs also 
staunchly opposed the Middle 
East’s wave of pro-democracy 
uprisings, seeing them as a threat 
to stability and their own rule.

He backed Sunni Muslim fac-

tions against Tehran’s allies in 
several countries, but in Lebanon 
for example, the policy failed to 
stop Iranian-backed Hezbollah 
from gaining the upper hand. 
And Tehran and Riyadh’s col-
liding ambitions stoked proxy 
conflicts around the region that 
enflamed Sunni-Shiite hatreds 
— most horrifically in Syria’s 
civil war, where the two coun-
tries backed opposing sides. 
Those conflicts in turn hiked 
Sunni militancy that returned to 
threaten Saudi Arabia.

And while the king main-

tained the historically close alli-
ance with Washington, there 
were frictions as he sought to 
put those relations on Saudi Ara-
bia’s terms. He was constantly 
frustrated by Washington’s fail-
ure to broker a settlement to the 
Israel-Palestinian conflict. He 
also pushed the Obama admin-
istration to take a tougher stand 
against Iran and to more strong-
ly back the mainly Sunni rebels 
fighting to overthrow Syrian 

President Bashar Assad.

A royal court statement said 

the king died at 1 a.m. on Friday. 
His successor was announced as 
79-year-old half-brother, Prince 
Salman, according to the state-
ment carried on the Saudi Press 
Agency. Salman was Abdullah’s 
crown prince and had recently 
taken on some of the ailing king’s 
responsibilities.

President 
Barack 
Obama 

expressed 
condolences 
and 

offered sympathy to the people of 
Saudi Arabia.

“As a leader, he was always 

candid and had the courage of 
his convictions,” Obama said. 
“One of those convictions was his 
steadfast and passionate belief in 
the importance of the U.S.-Saudi 
relationship as a force for stabili-
ty and security in the Middle East 
and beyond.”

Abdullah was born in Riyadh 

in 1924, one of the dozens of 
sons of Saudi Arabia’s founder, 
King Abdul-Aziz Al Saud. Like 
all Abdul-Aziz’s sons, Abdullah 
had only rudimentary education. 
Tall and heavyset, he felt more at 
home in the Nejd, the kingdom’s 
desert heartland, riding stal-
lions and hunting with falcons. 
His strict upbringing was exem-
plified by three days he spent in 
prison as a young man as punish-
ment by his father for failing to 
give his seat to a visitor, a viola-
tion of Bedouin hospitality.

Abdullah 
was 
selected 
as 

crown prince in 1982 on the day 
his half-brother Fahd ascended 
to the throne. The decision was 
challenged by a full brother of 
Fahd, Prince Sultan, who wanted 
the title for himself. But the fami-
ly eventually closed ranks behind 
Abdullah to prevent splits.

Abdullah became de facto 

ruler in 1995 when a stroke inca-
pacitated Fahd. Abdullah was 
believed to have long rankled at 
the closeness of the alliance with 
the United States, and as regent 
he pressed Washington to with-
draw the troops it had deployed 
in the kingdom since the 1990 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The U.S. 
finally did so in 2003.

For the Daily

As Michigan’s 98th legislative 

session kicked off Wednesday, 
Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–Ann Arbor) 
and Rep. Adam Zemke (D–Ann 
Arbor) returned to Lansing with 
several priorities on their agendas.

In an interview Thursday, 

Zemke said he plans to empha-
size education funding during 
the upcoming session. Zemke, 
who is in his second term repre-
senting Michigan’s 55th House 
District, said last session he 
focused on supporting educators 
and improving school districts, 
including those in high poverty 
communities.

He said a chief concern for 

the current legislative session is 
that education could take a hit 
following a House Fiscal Agen-
cy projection of a $454 million 
shortfall in the state’s general 
budget, released Wednesday.

“We really have to work to 

preserve funding at the cur-
rent levels,” Zemke said. “And 
really it should be increased, but 
especially given a budget deficit 
of $460 million, you’re talking 
about a lot of items that we have 
to watch.”

He cited Republican Gov. 

Rick Snyder’s package to fund 
infrastructure repairs, which 
would cut 20 percent of state 
appropriations to higher educa-
tion from the School Aid Fund, 
shifting much of the responsibil-
ity for funding public universi-
ties to the General Fund.

Zemke said that loss of money 

from the School Aid Fund, pre-
served for community college 
and K-12 education, has poten-
tially negative implications for 
higher education funding.

“University funding would 

then have to come out of the 
General Fund solely,” he said. 

“With the projected shortfall of 
the budget, we’ve really got to be 
watching that university fund-
ing to make sure that the budget 
is not balanced the backs of stu-
dents.”

In an interview Thursday, 

Irwin also identified higher edu-
cation funding as an important 
area for the legislature, noting in 
particular how higher education 
funding has decreased in the last 
decade.

“Michigan used to be a real 

leader in the nation in terms of 
education policy,” Irwin said. 
“Over the course of the last 
decade, especially the last two 
years, we’ve really fallen off that 
pace.”

To return to the state’s for-

mer stature, Irwin said Michi-
gan must engage the public and 
bring education to the forefront 
of the political agenda.

“Clearly, we need to get back 

to a place where Michigan is 
making higher ed a priority and 
the public is investing more in 
our institutions of higher learn-
ing so that we can control tuition 
and could try to control student 
debt,” he said.

Irwin, who is in his final term 

of representing Michigan’s 53rd 
District, also said he wants to 
renew state energy efficiency 
policy and push the development 
of more clean energy resources 
in the state.

Irwin cited Michigan’s Pub-

lic Act 295 — which was signed 
into law in 2008, but expired 
this year — as a focus. The act 
was a state initiative to reduce 
the amount of non-renewable 
energy used by utilities owned 
by the state.

Irwin said Public Act 295 

required that 10 percent of 
power be generated by renew-
ables by 2015. Irwin also noted 
many citizens advocated against 
the act because of its costs.

“But, the reality is that in the 

last seven years, we’ve had tre-
mendous success,” Irwin said. 
“Renewable power has come in 
cheaper than anybody expect-
ed.”

Along with pushing for con-

tinued clean energy, Irwin said 
he has already introduced a 
bill this session that calls for 
a graduated income tax in the 
state. Currently, Michigan has 
a flat-rate personal income tax. 
Under a graduated income tax, 
individuals with higher incomes 
would pay a larger percentage 
of their income toward the tax 
than those with lower incomes.

Irwin has introduced this 

proposal to session in his first 
term, second term and now third 
term.

Irwin also said he wants to 

change the adoption policy in 
the state. Currently, only het-
erosexual couples can adopt a 
child. Irwin said he wants to 
reform the policy to allow sec-
ond-parent adoption, which is 
currently not legal in the state. 
Second-parent adoption refers 
to parents who cannot legally 
marry, such as same-sex couples.

“It is especially important 

because you’ve got children in 
the state of Michigan who are 
living in these homes,” he said. 
“They are living in the homes 
headed by either heterosexual or 
homosexual couples who did not 
wish to marry.”

Irwin said the children are at 

a severe disadvantage because

“Those kids deserve the same 

rights as kids who are adopted

children who are adopted into 
those families have less rights to

Dingell said. “I think people 
look at Michigan and they go: 
‘labor state,’ and sometimes don’t 
realize what a competitive state it 
is to do business in.”

She said she was elated when 

General Electric decided to 
open a Michigan manufacturing 
technology facility in 2009, and 
was hopeful more companies 
would come, while preserving 
those currently in the state.

Dingell also expressed an 

enthusiasm for providing higher 
education funding. Prior to her 
election to the House, she served 
on the Board of Governors at 
Wayne State University for over 
eight years.

“I’m passionate about ensur-

ing that our young people have 
access to quality, affordable 
education,” Dingell said.

She noted that her experience 

working on the Board of Gover-
nors at Wayne State allowed her 
to speak with students and gain 
their perspectives on issues such 
as the cost of tuition.

To improve higher educa-

tion, Dingell said she thought 
the federal government should 

put more money into education 
and remove some of the burdens 
of funding universities from the 
states.

Additionally, Dingell expressed 

interest in decreasing the interest 
rates on federal student loans and 
praised President Barack Obama’s 
plan for two years of free commu-
nity college, highlighted during 
his State of the Union Address. 
She pointed out that many high-
earning jobs, such as pipe fitters, 
only need two years of higher 
education.

Along with Obama’s com-

munity college proposal, Ding-
ell also highlighted two other 
White House initiatives fea-
tured in the State of the Union 
— improved pay equity between 
men and women and the presi-
dent’s plan to increase the mini-
mum wage — as important for 
Michigan.

“The numbers say the econo-

my’s better, but in Michigan too 
many people I know, their wages 
have stayed stagnant as consumer 
prices have gone up,” Dingell said. 
“So I think everybody does better 
when people who are working 
hard are paid a good minimum 
wage, because that money comes 
back into the economy.”

According to Wei, patients in 

the area with urological condi-
tions previously were forced to 
look elsewhere for treatment 
options. He added that many 
patients in Flint also do not have 
easy access to transportation.

“Because of the outright dis-

interest or refusal of the private 
urologists in town to help out 
with their patients, essentially 
telling them they can go to (the 
University) to get seen, the clinic 

had to find another way,” he said.

Most of the patients who will 

be seen at first will be current 
HCHN, which already has prima-
ry care providers and physicians.

Wei said the clinic could face 

several challenges, including less 
up-to-date equipment as com-
pared to University facilities.

“We are a little hampered, 

I confess, because the clinic 
doesn’t have all the equipment we 
are used to,” Wei said. “They are 
quite expensive, so we can’t offer 
a full range of service right now. 
However, if things takes off and 
we get busy, maybe there will be 
more funds from the government 
at some point.”

He added that the clinic’s 

schedule for the first day next 
Wednesday is already full.

organizations involved to take 
similar 
action,” 
Fitzgerald 

wrote.

Fitzgerald said the University 

will sort out additional details 
before considering sanctions on 
the organizations or individuals 
involved.

“The executive boards of the 

Interfraternity 
Council 
and 

Panhellenic Association on the 
Ann Arbor campus have initiat-
ed their own reviews of this situ-
ation that could lead to sanctions 
against the fraternity and soror-
ity chapters,” he wrote.

There is a pending Michigan 

State Police investigation that 
could lead to criminal charges.

At Treetops, damage included 

felled ceiling tiles, broken walls 
and destroyed furniture. Similar 
damage occurred at Boyne High-
lands.

In a statement Wednesday, 

Sigma Alpha Mu president Josh-

ua Kaplan, a Business sopho-
more, apologized for the damage 
done by the fraternity. He said 
those responsible would be held 
accountable, and that the frater-
nity would work with Treetops to 
pay for the damages.

“We are embarrassed and 

ashamed of the behavior of a few 
of our chapter members at Tree-
tops Resort over the weekend of 
January 17-18,” Kaplan wrote. 
“This behavior is inconsistent 
with the values, policies, and 
practices of this organization.”

E. Royster Harper, vice presi-

dent for student life, wrote in a 
statement that the incidents don’t 
reflect the University’s values.

“The university is investigat-

ing this fully and those respon-
sible will be held accountable. 
It is especially disappointing 
since this behavior does not 
reflect the broad majority of 
U-M students who participate 
in Greek Life and compromises 
the many valuable contribu-
tions these student organiza-
tions provide.”

cuts because details haven’t 
been announced yet. However, 
Boulus added that while the 
deficit could have an impact on 
higher education funding, he’s 
hopeful it will not.

John Austin, president of 

the State Board of Education, 
said he thinks the budget defi-
cit will make it difficult for the 
state to get back on a favorable 
track for education funding.

In 2011, the Snyder admin-

istration cut higher education 
funding by 15 percent. After 
the initial cut in higher edu-
cation funding, the Snyder 
administration has increased 
higher education funding by 
3.1 percent in 2012, 2.2 percent 
in 2013 and 6.1 percent in 2014.

Education also saw sev-

eral incremental decreases in 
funding during the previous 
administration under former 
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm.

Austin said at one point, 4.1 

percent of the state’s income 
went to education, including 
higher education. However, he 
emphasized that the 4.1 per-
cent has now dropped to 3.4 
percent.

The 
state 
of 
Michigan 

recently ranked one of the 
worst in the country in terms 
of higher education funding.

Though 
Snyder’s 
recent 

budgets have started to reverse 
the trend, Austin said plans to 
increase investment might be 
complicated by the deficit.

“With the budget situation 

and little temperature from the 
governor or legislature to raise 
new money, raise taxes in some 
way to put it into higher educa-
tion and financial aid, it’s very 
tough to keep making positive 
headway,” Austin said.

Don 
Grimes, 
a 
senior 

research associate at the Insti-
tute for Research on Labor, 
Employment and the Economy, 
said the deficit means the Uni-
versity will probably receive 
less money next year.

For the 2015 fiscal year, 71.2 

percent of the University’s 
budget comes from tuition and 
fees, according to the Univer-
sity’s Funding Snapshot. The 
state of Michigan currently 
contributes 16.4 percent of the 
University’s budget.

“Higher education has tradi-

tionally been one of the budget 
items that the state govern-
ment, under both Republicans 
and Democrats, have used the 
most to balance shortfalls,” 
Grimes said. “In other words, 
they cut higher education tra-
ditionally when (we) think 
we’re out of money. It tends to 
be one of those flexible budget 
items that they address.”

Grimes added that universi-

ties have other means of gen-
erating revenue to perform 
university operations, which is 
a reason why higher education 
funding is often cut.

“Traditionally, the assump-

tion is that the universi-
ties can get the money from 
other sources if they lose it,” 
Grimes said. “Essentially they 
can either take it out of their 
endowments, they can raise 
tuition or they could make bud-

get cuts.”

Austin said the state govern-

ment had several other options 
to support higher education 
despite the projected deficit, 
including rearranging the bud-
get to invest more in student 
financial aid, raising taxes or 
reforming the tax code. He 
pointed to cutting corporate 
and business taxes and the 
lowering of the flat income tax 
from 7 percent to about 4 per-
cent as other possible reasons 
for the state’s decrease in high-
er education funding.

Austin added that if the state 

of Michigan kept the same 
tax rate implemented under 
former Republican Gov. John 
Engler, higher education fund-
ing wouldn’t be a major issue.

“We would have eight bil-

lion dollars more to spend on 
education, higher education 
and roads — eight billion dol-
lars — if we just had the same 
tax rates that we had 12 years 
ago,” he said.

Austin said a common per-

ception is that universities 
receive the blame for raising 
tuition, but people should also 
recognize the impact of state 
funding declines.

“The rise in tuitions are not 

the universities’ fault at all,” he 
said. “They’ve had no choice 
but to raise tuitions to pay for 
the cost of educating (students) 
because the state has basically 
defunded universities.”

Snyder will propose plans 

to address the budget deficit 
when he releases his executive 
budget summary Feb. 11.

Yellowstone begins 
transferring bison 
for slaughter 

Yellowstone 
National 
Park 

has begun shipping wild bison 
for slaughter as part of a plan 
to reduce the park’s population 
by as many as 900 animals this 
winter.

On Wednesday and Thursday, 

more than 150 bison captured 
near the park’s northern border 
with Montana were removed 
from holding, loaded onto trail-
ers and shipped off, according 
to the Buffalo Field Campaign, a 
wildlife advocacy group.

There were 4,900 bison in 

the park last summer. For more 
than two decades, officials have 
tried to curb the animals’ winter 
migration into Montana to guard 
against potential disease trans-
mission to livestock.

Park 
spokesman 
Al 
Nash 

confirmed 
the 
shipments 
of 

recently-captured animals for 
slaughter. But he said the park 
no longer plans to offer timely 
updates on how many bison are 
captured and shipped.

SAN DIEGO
Magnets used to 
plant drugs under 
cars from Mexico 

Drug smugglers are turning 

“trusted travelers” into unwit-
ting mules by placing containers 
with powerful magnets under 
their cars in Mexico and then 
recovering the illegal cargo far 
from the view of border authori-
ties in the United States.

One motorist spotted the con-

tainers while pumping gas after 
crossing into Southern Cali-
fornia on Jan. 12 and thought it 
might be a bomb.

His call to police prompted an 

emergency response at the Chev-
ron station, and then a shocker: 
13.2 pounds of heroin were 
pulled from under the vehicle, 
according to a U.S. law enforce-
ment official. San Diego police 
said the drugs were packed 
inside six magnetized cylinders.

Ukraine bus attack 
kills 13, dashes 
peace hopes 

Hours after a new peace ini-

tiative for Ukraine began taking 
shape, mortar shells rained down 
Thursday on the center of the 
main rebel-held city in the east, 
killing at least 13 people at a bus 
stop.

The deaths in Donetsk sparked 

wrath and grief that was swiftly 
exploited by pro-Russian rebel 
leaders, who paraded captive 
Ukrainian troops through the city 
to be punched, kicked and insult-
ed by enraged residents.

Diplomats 
from 
Russia, 

Ukraine, France and Germany 
had met in Berlin a day ago to 
thrash out a tentative dividing 
line from which the warring sides 
would pull back their heavy weap-
ons. That solution already looks 
doomed.

and muscle control. According 
to the ALD Foundation, the 
disease is found in one out of 
every 17,900 boys. It is more 
prevalent among males than 
females. Aside from loss of 
muscle control, the disease can 
lead to loss of sight, hearing 
and is potentially fatal.

Kendrick is a seventh-grade 

schoolteacher in New Jersey 
who graduated from the Uni-
versity’s School of Education in 
2005. Kendrick discovered she 
was a carrier of ALD ten years 
ago. When she found out, she 
decided the safest choice for 
her and her husband to con-
ceive would be through in vitro 
fertilization.

“It wasn’t really a decision, 

it was just the responsible 
thing to do,” Kendrick said. “I 
didn’t know ten years ago that 
this would even be an option 
and that we could do in vitro 
and genetic graining. But once 
we learned that was available, 
again it wasn’t really a choice. 
It was the right decision.”

The in vitro fertilization 

was successful in preventing 
the proliferation of ALD from 
mother to son. The Kendricks’ 
son Gus is a healthy, disease-
free child.

Using 
the 
embryos, 

researchers at MStem were 
able to develop stem cell lines 
to observe the development 
and progression of the disease 
to see how to best treat symp-
toms and potentially cure the 
disease.

Gary Smith, director of the 

MStem Cell Laboratories, said 

the lab focuses a lot on neuro-
degenerative diseases.

The lab opened in 2009 after 

the Michigan voters passed 
of the Michigan Stem Cell 
Amendment in 2008. The con-
stitutional amendment made 
it legal to conduct research on 
human embryos and produce 
human embryonic stem cells. 
For this reason, researchers 
like Smith can now work with 
diseased embryos to create 
stem cells.

“The unique aspect with 

regards to the embryonic stem 
cell line is that they are made 
from embryos that otherwise 
would have been discarded as 
they have already been tested 
and are known to carry the 
genetic mutation for, in most 
instances, a very fatal disease,” 
Smith said.

State legislator 
faces bribery 
charges, trial 

Assembly Speaker 

Sheldon Silver 
arrested for $4 
million payoff

NEW YORK (AP) — Assem-

bly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who 
bent state government to his 
will for more than 20 years as 
one of New York’s most power-
ful and canny politicians, was 
arrested Thursday on charges 
of taking nearly $4 million in 
payoffs and kickbacks.

The 70-year-old Democrat 

was taken into custody by the 
FBI on federal conspiracy and 
bribery charges that carry 
up to 100 years in prison and 
could cost him his politi-
cal seat. He was released on 
$200,000 bail.

U.S. Attorney Preet Bhar-

ara said Silver, a lawyer by 
training, lined up jobs at two 
firms and then accepted large 
sums of money over more 
than a decade in exchange for 
using his “titanic” power to 
do political favors. The money 
was disguised as “referral 
fees,” Bharara said.

Silver, who seemed unfazed 

in court, did not enter a plea.

“I’m confident that after 

a full hearing and due pro-
cess I’ll be vindicated on the 
charges,” said Silver, who 
even paused on his way out of 
court to sign a sketch artist’s 

rendering of the scene.

The arrest sent shock waves 

through New York’s Capi-
tol and came just a day after 
Silver shared the stage with 
Democratic 
Gov. 
Andrew 

Cuomo during his State of the 
State address, as Cuomo joked 
that he, Silver and the Sen-
ate majority leader were the 
“three amigos” of state gov-
ernment.

At a meeting Thursday 

with the Daily News editorial 
board, Cuomo said of Silver’s 
arrest: “Obviously it’s bad for 
the speaker, but it’s also a bad 
reflection on government, and 
it adds to the negativity.”

Silver is one of Albany’s 

most storied political figures, 
a 
consummate 
backroom 

operator with the power to 
single-handedly decide the 
fate of legislation.

Along 
with 
the 
Senate 

majority leader and the gov-
ernor, he plays a major role in 
creating state budgets, laws 
and policies in a system long 
criticized in Albany as “three 
men in a room.” He controls, 
for example, which lawmak-
ers sit on which committees 
and decides whether a bill gets 
a vote.

In a measure of his clout, he 

helped persuade Cuomo last 
spring to disband a state anti-
corruption commission that 
was investigating Silver’s finan-
cial dealings and those of his 
colleagues.

said ‘You know what, we’re 
going to set a precedent. It’s a 
new term. We’re starting fresh,’ 
” he said.

He 
added 
that 
citizens 

should know what the govern-
ment is doing, which is why he 
wants to improve the transpar-
ency of his actions.

“There’s going to be a lot 

issues that are going to be post-
ed that they probably will have 
not much interest in and we 
recognize that,” he said. “We’re 
going to try and be as concise as 
possible and make the informa-
tion available.”

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

As a freshman, I’ve found my first semester 

of college to be one of the most overwhelm-
ing and rewarding growing experiences 
I’ve ever encountered: meeting more people 
than I ever have before, navigating the vast 
sea of people that is our student population 
and taking classes that twisted my perspec-
tive and seemed to challenge every assump-
tion I had once held as truth. As a result, 
my worldview has shifted; my beliefs have 
become more robust. Having opinions about 
social and political issues has become less of a 
lazy, automatic reflex and more of a thought-
ful, deliberate action. I came home for winter 
break carrying an identity that’s undergone a 
kind of collegiate evolution.

This happens to many freshmen: the first 

semester of college knocks them off their feet, 
creating the potential for a trip home for win-
ter break that might be a little weird, spending 
extended amounts of time with friends and 
family who only knew you pre-first semester.

As I mentioned before, one of the biggest 

changes I’ve experienced in my first semester 
is that my opinions have grown stronger, which 
has allowed me to have more confidence in 
them and be more willing to share them. For 
example, having been exposed to the preva-
lence of sexual assault on college campuses, 
I’ve become more acutely aware of sexism that 
can sometimes find its way into everyday con-
versation. I’ve always been an advocate of gen-
der equality, but now more than ever, I see it as 
an issue that needs as many voices as possible. 
If a friend makes a sexist remark and doesn’t 
realize it’s sexist, I’ve learned how to playfully 
point out its discriminatory nature.

People are pretty open to that sort of thing 

around here; those conversations have always 
taken place with friends and fellow students 
who are open to different experiences and 
new perspectives. But what happens when we 
go home, where we’re surrounded by family 
members who aren’t university students, who 
aren’t taking classes that challenge their ways 
of thinking, who aren’t immersed in the explor-
atory, socially and politically active campus 
that we are? What happens when an older fam-
ily member, someone you’ve grown up respect-
ing and would feel disrespected if contradicted, 
makes an out-of-the-closet joke right in front 

of you? Are you supposed to abandon all of the 
work you’ve done forming opinions, making 
arguments and peacefully advocating what you 
think is just for the sake of keeping the peace?

I’ve experienced this problem before, the 

problem of being surrounded by people I love 
unconditionally but sometimes seem to stand 
against what I believe is right. It seems absurd 
that two things so personal to me can be so 
frustratingly contradictory. People always talk 
about family and heritage being what a person 
is made of, but what happens when “what we’re 
made of” doesn’t seem to be what we are?

It boils down to a puzzle with which people 

have been grappling for a long time, one that each 
person continues to grapple with throughout life: 
the apparent dissonance between background 
and self. A dissonance, in the musical sense of the 
word, is “a clashing or unresolved musical inter-
val or chord,” a simple lack of agreement.

But when one’s family doesn’t reflect oneself, 

it doesn’t necessarily mean that person’s fam-
ily isn’t what makes them who they are. Maybe 
the fact that a dissonance occurs is what defines 
that person in however minor or major ways. 
We are, to a certain extent, a product of our 
experiences, and in this way, these uncomfort-
able experiences with those we love are part of 
what makes us who we are.

The solution may not be to start a heated 

moral or political debate at a family dinner 
because ultimately, it probably won’t go over 
well. Perhaps simply stating one’s opinion in 
a subtle and non-confrontational way is an 
appropriate way to hold true to one’s mor-
als and attitudes while still maintaining the 
respect integral in certain family relationships.

Even if this does not go over well, it is con-

soling to remember that family is what makes 
us who we are, to the extent that our collec-
tive experiences are what make us who we are. 
To fellow freshmen and anyone else who has 
recently felt this way, remind yourself every 
now and then that our ability to control how we 
react to what seems like a dissonance with our 
families and our identities can make the dis-
comfort of winter break festivities feel a little 
less like a punch to the chest.

REGAN DETWILER| VIEWPOINT

Dealing with dissonance

I

’m a creative writer. I like writing fic-
tion. I also occasionally take part in the 
sort of journalistic writing that I admit-

tedly don’t understand. But 
I’m very much a creative 
writer of fiction. Doing so in 
a democratic country means 
I take full advantage of my 
First 
Amendment 
rights. 

Loving what I do also means 
that I plan to continue taking 
full advantage of my right to 
express myself.

Yet these facts shouldn’t 

be the end of a conversation, 
especially one as complex 
as the Charlie Hebdo case. 
I write. I express myself. I don’t deserve death 
or injury or threats under any circumstances. 
Anyone who has been a victim of such violence 
because they chose to express themselves should 
receive our greatest condolences and support.

But again, our conversation shouldn’t end 

here, with a generalized statement about a code 
of conduct that most of us already follow. We 
need to understand context. We need to take 
into account nuances. We especially need to talk 
about something that I almost never hear when 
we talk about creativity and expression — power.

Power in the sense of artistic freedom means 

I not only have the ability to express myself, but 
I also (and especially) have the means to do so 
to an audience who will listen. The first facet 
of the “power to express” I think most people 
have down: we all have opinions and ideas, 
and we’re generally able to communicate them 
using our respective languages — written, spo-
ken, performed or drawn. It’s when we get to 
the other two facets that everything gets messy 
and suddenly race, ethnicity, socioeconomic 
status, gender, ability, citizenship, etc. come 
into play. In the case of Charlie Hebdo, we need 
to think about how many Muslim citizens and 
immigrants don’t have the same access to pub-
lic self-expression as do non-Muslims.

In 2010, a Stanford study found that a Chris-

tian citizen of France is more than twice as 
likely to get a call-back for a job interview as 
an equally qualified Muslim citizen. About 
60 percent of the prison population in France 
is comprised of those with Muslim ties. In 
July, the European Court upheld France’s 
ban on wearing the Muslim niqab in public. 
The single tragedy of Charlie Hebdo, no mat-

ter how devastating, cannot be viewed in a 
vacuum, especially not when discrimination 
against Muslims is a real and current issue. 
We’re talking about an influential magazine 
using its power to comment on a religion that 
is practiced by a group of people whose voices 
have never been fully heard. The issue is no 
longer about the right to express. The issue is 
about the “power to express,” namely having a 
means to say something as well as an audience 
who will listen, which I mentioned earlier. 
Muslim women not being allowed to wear the 
niqab demonstrates that a means of expression 
has been revoked. Discrimination in the work-
force and higher rates of incarceration mean 
the French culture as a whole is unwilling to 
be a listening audience.

In creative writing, there’s been a running 

debate on whether or not our works carry any 
sort of social burden. It’s a difficult discussion, 
and I see both sides of the argument. If artists 
are limited in what they can say or do, then 
that means art cannot evolve. After all, many 
of our greatest literary classics today were 
once very controversial. At the same time, I 
think all artists need to be more mindful of 
how their pieces influence others and shape 
others’ beliefs, especially if the subject matter 
touches on those who lack the sort of power 
and influence to assert their own dignity. How 
does Charlie Hebdo’s portrayal of Islam affect 
the already negative opinions of Muslim citi-
zens and immigrants in France? Do Muslims 
have access to artistic mediums where their 
voices can be heard just as loudly with just as 
much respect? As a brief side note, I’ve always 
found it interesting that many writers I know 
want to make a difference through their writ-
ing. But when we realize that our pieces might 
have any smidgen of negative social conse-
quence on marginalized people, we hide and 
say we’re only “expressing ourselves.”

When Charlie Hebdo published their maga-

zine covers portraying the Prophet Muham-
mad, they sent a message to the world beyond 
merely their views on Islam. They told the 
world just how much power they, as non-Mus-
lim artists, held. They were saying, “Look at 
me. Look at the kind of power I hold over you. 
I can depict a religious leader whom I don’t fol-
low in any way however I want. Look at me.”

The power to express

MICHAEL SCHRAMM | QUEER IN ACTION

I wish I could say “I’m gay” and let 

it roll off my tongue. Hear the words 
make noise as they float into people’s 
ears. Feel some sense of comfort with 
how they mix with my personality, 
my masculinity and my femininity.

But they never have.
I’ve never fit into conventional 

masculinity. I hated sports and fight-
ing. I loved Avril Lavigne and “Pretty 
Little Liars,” but I quickly realized 
this wasn’t “normal” boy behavior. 
Instead, I learned that I needed to 
be tough, hyper-sexual and rug-
ged. Never show emotion, and most 
importantly, be very straight. I 
learned that men who didn’t follow 
these traits were pussies, exiled from 
the pack.

I was pushed into the heteromold 

— the institutional and self-policed 
mold we use to cast every boy into 
this identity. My peers, and even 
adults, pressed with varying degrees 
of pressure against my bones to fit 
me into the cast. I learned to fill it 
above all else, or I would risk being 
labeled gay. Gay was weak, embar-
rassing and shameful, and I wanted 
no one to think I was gay, especially 
since I was.

Sometimes 
I 
was 
physically 

pushed into the mold.

I signed up for freshman football 

because a family member suggested 
it. It wasn’t a good decision. I was 
atrocious, and it only aided in wiring 
my brain to reject my identity.

It was 90-degree weather. We all 

wore bulky equipment and we all 
drank from rugged-looking Gato-
rade bottles and we all formed lines 
in synchronization and we all looked 
the same. One day, our coaches 
instructed us to guard against a part-
ner and stop them from pushing past 
us. To no one’s surprise, someone 
pushed past me. Typically, coaches 
would make a suggestion to improve, 
but this time everyone was brought 
together as my coach told me, “You’re 
a disgrace to this team.”

My body raced with a mix of adren-

aline and fear, and I felt the intense 
pressures of being pushed into the 
heteromold. I realized how my team-
mates would react. They laughed 
with an abrasively teasing tone, and 
I found myself immediately labeled 
as the weakest one. The wimpy one. 
The gay one. My mockery served as a 
feast for the self-loathing of my femi-
ninity and gay identity.

I wish I could grab 14-year-old 

me, drag him to the sidelines, strip 
his overheating equipment and 
place my hands on his exposed 
shoulder as an affirmation of love. 
I want to wrap him in warmth and 
tell him what he needs to hear. That 
being gay is great, being effeminate 
is great and neither is a symptom of 
the other. That his eyes are lit with 
ambition and his soul blazes with 
personality and being gay takes 

nothing away from that.

But I was too young, and people 

had spent too long coding my hatred 
of everything surrounding their per-
ception of gay.

It began in sixth grade. I sat sur-

rounded by my friends in a library. 
Huddled on beanbags amongst 
books 
of 
knowledge 
we 
were 

taught a clear lesson: homosexual-
ity equaled sin. Someone being gay 
was fine, but only if they didn’t act 
on their attractions, meaning they 
rejected their sexuality.

That struck a chord in seventh 

grade, when I had a crush on a guy. 
Puberty hit me in the close confines 
of the boys’ locker room. Amongst 
the chatter about girls, I found myself 
developing an internal monologue 
about my crush. As he gushed about 
the girl he liked, I became distracted, 
smelling his Axe body spray against 
his natural scent, hearing the tone of 
his voice, seeing the subtle gestures 
he made to air out his shirt. Part of 
me craved him.

But the other part wanted nothing 

more than to erase these senses and 
talk about girls. I became infected 
with homophobic undertones, and 
my brain was at war on whether to 
squeeze into the heteromold. I was 
13 years old. I should have been con-
cerned with pre-algebra, but instead 
I fought unrequited emotions, preju-
dice and a split sense of identity. My 
heart rested in the locket of my chest 
— shackled, prickly and pure.

I graduated in the closet and 

entered college closeted. On Michi-
gan’s liberal campus, this didn’t last 
long. I heard overwhelming accep-
tance toward homosexuality, and it 
served as an antibiotic to my homo-
phobic infection. I unlocked my 
sexuality to the confidence of accept-
ing peers. They were receptive and 
provided me inviting hugs and kind 
words. I felt like I was reaching the 
end of my journey.

I wasn’t.
Instead of receiving shame for my 

feminine traits, I was subconscious-
ly shamed for my masculine ones. 
Many treated me as a pre-packaged 
toy with clear instructions: heel 
guru, overdramatic, boy-crazy, a 
plaything. Whether explicit or not, 
I was the gay friend for many, and 
I was taught to be one of the girls, 
never one of the boys.

When I began weightlifting, I was 

told it was “cute.” Guys I befriended 
got teased, told that my attempts 
to bond in the dining hall were bla-
tantly transparent attempts of going 
on a date.

It’s bizarre. The moment I declared 

a piece of my identity outside of the 
heteromold, I was automatically cast 
as its antithesis. Why?

Why is it so difficult for people 

to understand that my skin, bones 
and cells are not liquid sludge that 

forms into a solid cast? I like physi-
cal strength and wear my heart on 
my sleeve. My identity doesn’t fol-
low a precedent. I’m unpredictable, 
three-dimensional, dense. None of it 
has anything to do with my sexuality, 
and all of it is fine.

I’ve been foolish in thinking 

otherwise, and I’m starting to 
 realize this.

Cramped between dozens of peo-

ple at a house party this year I ran 
into a guy for whom I cared deeply. 
He was never a romantic interest, but 
his cordial attitude gave off a friendly 
warmth that led me to try hard in 
becoming close friends. Hidden in 
my mind was the thought that some-
one would let me into the male inner 
circle without the prerequisite of a 
masculine façade.

As we said hi by the refrigerator, 

much like my prior attempts to bond, 
I was smacked with the cold reality 
that this would never happen with 
him. There always existed a barrier 
between us that I saw go down when 
he interacted with other guys.

Our conversation ended and 

he headed the 10 feet back to his 
pack of male friends. They all wore 
backwards caps and huddled in 
a tight-knit circle and decided to 
play beer pong. I saw the animated 
expressions and gestures that he 
gave his friends contrast the stiff-
ness he always gave me. Whether 
conscious or not, I could tell his 
inability to open up to me was 
because I lay outside the hetero-
mold. It’s not something you need 
definitive confirmation to confirm. 
Once it happens to you, you know 
it’s happening.

It was in that moment that I real-

ized he would never invite me into 
the circle. My micro differences 
between these people created an 
impenetrable wall, and though I 
stood 10 feet from them, the dis-
tance between us was infinite.

And I was okay with it.
I walked up to a friend behind 

the group, put my arm around her, 
and let the pressures roll off my 
back. It was a move — or lack there-
of — spurred by nothing more than 
my desire to push against the forces 
around me. I wanted to conquer the 
echoes that resurface in my head. 
That night, I won.

I’m still insecure. My identity isn’t 

protected by an impenetrable glaze 
of security, but I can feel myself 
developing a Jell-O-like covering 
of confidence. When I feel pressure 
from the outside world, I feel its 
impact, and my defense mechanism 
starts moving me back to my original 
shape. It’s through this that I return 
to the form I choose for myself: mas-
culine, feminine, gay. Infinite.

The oppressive pressures of 

the heteromold

R

ight 
now, 
it’s 
snowing 

outside. The sky and the 
ground, and it seems every-

thing in between, 
are white or gray 
or (even worse) 
that 
disgusting 

shade of brown 
that comes when 
fresh snow mixes 
with 
dirt 
and 

gets splattered all 
over 
unsuspect-

ing 
pedestrians 

by cars. In other 
words, 
it’s 
not 

exactly the time of year when peo-
ple relish going outside. During the 
heart of January (which also can be 
described as the heart of winter) 
most people are not going for strolls 
in the Arb, or going on long-distance 
runs through campus — although I 
still see the most dedicated runners 
sprinting through the tundra that is 
“Ann Arbtica” and I don’t think I’ve 
ever been more impressed.

Students bundle up in huge, puffy 

jackets, ski masks, hats, gloves and 
sometimes even multiple pairs of 
pants (wait, that might just be me…) 
to quickly shuffle through Michi-

gan’s icy weather. They barely reg-
ister their surroundings, allowing 
their vision to be terribly impaired 
by drooping, fur-lined hoods and 
hats that fall far below the typical 
brow line of any human. And if we 
can avoid walking, we will. The 
magic bus app becomes essential 
to life and, when the prices aren’t 
surging, Uber becomes our best 
friend.

But maybe this trend of avoiding 

the icy weather isn’t for the best. 
Now, I’m not saying that we should 
lay out tanning in the freezing 
weather, but the freezing quality of 
nature right now does not take away 
from its beauty. Snow dances in the 
wind and gets caught in the waving 
branches of naked trees. Footsteps 
through the snow make campus 
feel lived in, and the Arb looks 
straight out of a fairy tale. Plus, 
being outside in the cold makes me 
feel more alive. The blood rushes 
to my cheeks, and there is a crisp-
ness to the cold that is a welcome 
break from the stress and — let’s 
be honest — boredom that came 
from hunching over textbooks and 
homework for hours on end in a 
heat-controlled environment.

Going outside is good for our 

health, regardless of the weather. 
According to Abigail Wise of The 
Huffington Post, spending time 
outdoors actually increases con-
centration skills and creativity. It 
is also energizing: “20 minutes out-
side can wake you up just as much 
as one cup of coffee can.”

So next time you wake up for 

your 8 a.m. and your phone lets you 
know that it’s six degrees out but 
feels like minus-11, don’t despair. 
Stay bundled, but maybe don’t 
blindly hustle through the cold. 
Breathe in the fresh air and look up 
into the swirl of snowflakes. Enjoy 
the crunch of snow beneath your 
waterproof boots and the vague 
stinging feeling in your cheeks. Just 
know that time spent walking out-
side taking in the (thick, cloud-cov-
ered) sunlight will make you feel 
better, sharper and more motivated 
to get work done.

In fact, when I’m done writing 

this, I think I’m going to go for a 
walk in the Arb. It’s 25 degrees — 
practically a heat wave!

‘Sniper’ follows a 
typical formula

WARNER BROS

Sniper, no sniping.

By ANDREW MCCLURE

Daily Arts Writer

Oscar-nominated 

war drama 
disappoints

“American 
Sniper” 
nabbed 

a Best Picture nom this year 
alongside other 
unworthy picks 
(“The 
Theory 

of Everything” 
and “The Imi-
tation 
Game,” 

two films equal 
parts 
unreal-

ized and bravu-
ra-desperate), 
while bravura-
capturing “Fox-
catcher” 
got 

snubbed. Jason Hall’s script also 
received an unmerited nom for 
Best Adapted Screenplay, a deci-
sion by the Academy driven by 
the requisite of filling five spots, 
and nothing more, maybe less. 
Clint Eastwood’s (“Gran Torino”) 
wincingly problematic “American 
Sniper” is buoyed only by Brad-
ley Cooper’s nuanced portrayal 
of Chris Kyle, the “legendary” (a 
descriptor the script exhausts in 
fratircal fashion) Navy SEALs 
marksman on whose autobiogra-
phy the script is based. In its epi-
sodic skeleton we never dig deep, 
dark, enough into Kyle’s seen-
some-shit psyche and instead dig 
too long for meaning in Kyle’s life 
back home — except we’re dig-
ging using a twig, not a shovel.

Tired narrative tools thank-

fully don’t kick off until half-
way through the opening scene 
where we find a surgeon-steady 
Cooper 
(“American 
Hustle”), 

belly-down atop a sandy roof in 

Iraq. Both eyes open, unmoving, 
he spots a little boy through his 
crosshairs. The boy is carrying 
an anti-tank hand grenade (an 
“RKG”) and walking toward the 
Marines. Cooper, as is protocol, 
walkie-talkies to a nearby Broth-
er for confirmation to put him 
down. No confirmation. Then, in 
what ignites the next two hours 
of storytelling recyclables, the 
watchman Marine next to him 
redundantly says, “They fry you 
if you’re wrong.” Even if that line 
were included in the autobiogra-
phy, come on, man.

Then we cut back in time to the 

grueling SEALs training on the 
beach, sleeping little, swallowing 
saltwater, being miserable — you 
know the drill. Then, naturally, 
the romantic spark occurs in the 
laughable setting of a bar, where a 
gorgeous yet unconvincing Sienna 
Miller (“Foxcatcher”) plays who 
other than his future wife. It all 
feels lazily familiar.

The rest of the picture vacil-

lates without confidence between 
his sharpshooting genius in the 
Middle East and the worry-faced 
Miller who, despite attempts 
at momming up her look, still 
appears to be a supermodel. 
Without screening it again with 
a meticulous eye, I’d venture to 
guess that Eastwood and Hall 
held some calculated formula, 
like for every six kills that are 
supposed to elicit real emotion in 
us, let’s whip-pan back to Miller, 
who, invariably, between her 
husband’s four nine-month-long 
tours, is concerned for his chance 
to regain mental stability. In a 
few words, the film never fleshes 
out anything more meaningful 
than the fraternal bond amid his 
Brothers abroad via busting each 
other’s balls and saying shit like, 
“Get some, motherfuckers!”

Cooper, nonetheless, saved this 

film from lightless despair with 
his charming Texan-ness — the 
accent, the chivalry, the semi-
intellectual sense of humor, the 
sincere grin. We feel safe in his 
presence. Even more, we need to 
be with him because Miller serves 
nothing other than a channel for 
his loaded emotions, something 
Eastwood only paws at.

One of the better scenes comes 

when Kyle runs into his little 
brother, who had just finished 
his first deployment tour, clearly 
shaken up, disturbed, by what he 
witnessed. The almost-jingoistic 
Kyle 
evinces 
disappointment, 

anger even, when little bro, before 
hopping into an aircraft, mumbles 
loudly, “Fuck this place.” Kyle 
possesses a telegraphable mania 
for war because, well, in his eyes 
there’s nothing better than serv-
ing your country and saving lives. 
Nothing. He doesn’t get his broth-
er’s indifference. Cooper peppers 
beautifully raw moments like this 
throughout, but the too-lean, too-
convenient entree that populates 
the remaining film doesn’t cut it.

As I walked into the theater, a 

friendly yet anxious man stopped 
me, “Seeing ‘Sniper?’ Shit sucks.” 
He went on to say he had served 
duty, read the autobiography, 
hadn’t even seen the film, but 
complained that Kyle was lion-
ized onscreen when, in reality, he 
killed several innocent children, 
among his 160 confirmed kills 
(and 255 probably kills). I couldn’t 
ditch the thought as I watched; 
However, by the end, it didn’t 
matter. Within its own universe, 
the film fails to find a power, ener-
gy higher than careening through 
mini missions and watching Mill-
er try to sob. Cooper’s newfound 
gut carries more guts than the 
emaciated scriptwriting.

‘Blackhat’ flounders

FILM REVIEW

By NOAH COHEN

Daily Arts Writer

When a cyberterrorist wreaks 

havoc on a Chinese nuclear facil-
ity, the United States government 
pulls 
Nicho-

las 
Hathaway 

(Chris 
Hems-

worth, “Thor”) 
out of prison 
and offers him 
full pardon to 
help them take 
down the new 
threat. 
The 

casting of Hem-
sworth is against-type, which, 
though shallow (hack me, you 
gorgeous Viking god), is mildly 
inspired; it’s too bad he can’t 
play a believable cyber security 
expert. 

Hollywood is fascinated by the 

idea of the master hacker, but the 
actual world of “hacking” is not 
very dramatic. The rare moment 
of hacker inspiration is sand-
wiched by hundreds of hours of 
bland coding. “Blackhat” gets 
“hacking” right about as much as 
James Bond gets “spying” right: 
But, in “Blackhat” ’s defense, it 
tries very hard to be realistically 
boring, even cramming out-of-
place tech references into the 
dialogue and dramatically show-
casing an honest-to-goodness 
Unix terminal. 

The technical elements suf-

fer the contorting humiliation of 
dramatic exploitation, and the 
romance suffers the exact same 
way. Wei Teng (“Lust, Cau-
tion”) plays the romantic inter-
est/sidekick, Lien Chen, whose 
inevitable 
relationship 
with 

Hemsworth seems unnaturally 
accelerated, and whose rela-
tionship with her brother (Lee-
hom Wang, “Lust, Caution”) is 
a brittle plot device ripe for the 
cracking. 
The 
manufactured 

suspense makes the audience 
feel psychic in that we can pre-
dict what’s about to happen at 
any given time. The explosions 
will still jolt the excitable, but 
the familiar strain of conflict 
and resolution is relaxing in its 
certainty. A movie about detec-
tive work and hacking becomes 
a cruise-control thriller, and the 
ride is embarrassingly smooth.

Lacking the camp glamour of 

“Swordfish” or “Hackers,” and 
lacking, too, the snappy, end-
lessly justifying writing of “The 
Social Network,” there seems 
little reason for this movie to 
exist. It adds nothing novel to 
its genre. The director, Michael 
Mann (“The Last of the Mohi-
cans”), who has received praise 
for the technical bravado of this 
sad flick, couldn’t tell an algo-
rithm from a hole in the wall 
(as the opening CGI sequence 

illustrates, literally). “Blackhat” 
was written, directed and acted 
out by people who think of a 
zero-day “backdoor” exploit as 
a literal backdoor that someone 
forgot to lock.

Its failure to faithfully depict 

hacking is secondary to its failure 
to thrill, and in this capacity, the 
film has thoughtful direction over 
writing that inexorably shoots 
itself in the foot – the epic-scale 
dramatic event at the beginning, a 
nuclear plant implosion, leads into 
a secret plot threatening another 
epic-scale event, the flooding of a 
tin mine. The impending, threat-
ened catastrophe is far less com-
pelling than the catastrophe that 
has already happened. This is a 
violation of Cinema 101: the stakes 
should increase, and instead they 
drop off.

The end of the movie is vague 

enough to allow for a sequel, but 
there probably won’t be one. The 
inspiration here was as sparse as 
its box office coffers.

Insightful Minaj doc

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

In the four years between 

Nicki Minaj’s first and third 
studio albums, she has grown 
exponentially, 
both 
as 
an 

artist 
and 

person. Nicki 
Minaj’s 
“My 

Time AGAIN” 
showcases 
the 
artist 

in 
a 
deeply 

personal 
and 
often 

emotional 
light as she 
prepares 
to open the 
2014 
VMAs 

and release her third LP, The 
Pinkprint.

Right off the bat, viewers 

get a sense for Minaj’s sense 
of 
humor 
that’s 
present 

throughout 
the 
hour-long 

documentary. The show opens 
with a monologue cut short 
by a phone call, after which 
she is giddy, confirmed by 
some tongue rolling, animal 
sound only Minaj could pull 
off — the “Anaconda” music 
video is going to be released at 
midnight. 

Following a rant about her 

time as a Red Lobster waitress 
and an on-point impression 
of a customer’s “Where’s our 
bread?,” 
rehearsals 
for 
the 

VMAs are underway.

“Every performance should 

be better than the last,” Minaj 
says in the film.

Minaj’s 
work 
ethic 
and 

commitment to her work and 
fans is undeniable throughout 
the 
VMA 
segment, 
from 

rehearsal to post-performance. 
She knocks out the entire 
choreography the first day of 
rehearsal; she shows genuine 
compassion and concern for 

a dancer who gets bitten by a 
snake; she takes her wardrobe 
malfunction in stride during 
the performance. The show 
must go on.

The malfunction is not on the 

level of Janet Jackson’s during 
the Superbowl, but Minaj does 
have to spit her “Bang Bang” 
verse while holding the front 
of her dress together. The 
palpable awkwardness doesn’t 
stop people from speculating it 
was planned.

“I would never embarrass 

myself, holding my dress on 
the VMAs, for what?” she says 
in her dressing room, slighting 
distraught.

We 
agree, 
Nicki, 
and 

honestly it would’ve been one 
of the lamest publicity stunts 
of all time. The stylist said 
nobody is to blame (yeah, that 
is what all stylists say after a 
wardrobe malfunction, but we 
know better).

The VMA segment opens the 

program well, but it is simply 
the appetizer before delving 
deeper into Minaj’s personal 
life in her hometown and in 
the studio working on her most 
personal album yet.

The meat of the show comes 

when she takes time to visit 
with her family and friends 
in her hometown of Queens, 
NY. It begins with Minaj 
getting a manicure with an 
old friend, and the manicurist 
will not take her money — it’s 
as if they’ve known each other 
forever. It’s cute, very homey 

and something most people can 
relate to at some point: when 
a 
manicurist, 
hair 
dresser 

or friend simply and kindly 
decides “This one’s on me.” 

This 
scene 
is 
only 
the 

beginning 
of 
a 
sincerely 

relatable segment overflowing 
with Minaj’s friends and family 
and touching monologues from 
the hip-hop star. It’s clear that 
friends and family are number 
one in her playbook.

“The secret of life is to 

embody love,” Minaj said. 

It’s clear Minaj has so much 

love in her life, between her 
two best friends, who she refers 
to as sisters, and one of their 
grandmothers who had taken 
Minaj as her own. The highlight 
of the hour is when Minaj’s 
grandmother complains about 
her cursing (I’ve had the same 
conversation with my mother, 
father and grandfather … ).

The 
program 
closes 
out 

with an insider look at Minaj’s 
album. 
She 
discusses 
how 

personal it is; her abortion is 
the topic of the album’s opening 
track, “All Things Go.” This 
segment is put together in a way 
that even those who have not 
heard her most recent work can 
appreciate the emotion put into 
it and the art that came from 
it. The tracks play, with lyrics 
pasted across the screen, and is 
followed by commentary from 
Minaj, her crew of producers 
and friends.

“I write life; I didn’t set out to 

make a personal album,” Minaj 
states.

Within five minutes, Minaj is 

both teary-eyed and holding up 
a glazed donut saying “heaven” 
— and that right there sums 
up the hour long Nicki Minaj 
documentary. She is fun, but has 
a lot of emotional struggles. She 
values friendship and family 
over everything. If you didn’t 
like Minaj before, this may just 
change your mind.

‘Justified’ keeps 
the stakes high

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

Final season of 
FX hit promises 

excitement

After a second season that will 

be regarded as one of the best 
seasons of television of all time, 
“Justified” 
dropped 
in 

quality. 
The 

following 
installments 
never 
quite 

created villains 
or stories that 
reached 
the 

same 
level 

of 
depth 
and 

complexity 
as 

Mags 
Bennett 

(Margo 
Martindale’s 
Emmy-

winning role). However, those 
seasons did a lot well, including 
developing 
the 
relationship 

between Raylan Givens and Boyd 
Crowder and of the setting, Harlan, 
KY. This season of the show is 
starting to use that groundwork 
to pay off its long-running arcs, 
giving confidence that even if the 
final go-around doesn’t reach the 
same height of season two, it will 
be a strong ending for the show.

“Justified” 
continues 
to 

follow the story of U.S. Marshal 
Raylan 
(Timothy 
Olyphant, 

“Deadwood”). This season, the 
Marshal is working to build a 
case against longtime rival Boyd 

(Walton Goggins, “The Shield”) 
before he leaves to join his child 
in Florida. He enlists the help 
of Crowder’s fiancé Ava (Joelle 
Carter, “American Pie 2”) as a 
criminal informant. Meanwhile, 
both of them deal with the arrival 
of new villains with mysterious 
plans for Harlan, played by Garret 
Dillahunt (“Deadwood”) and Sam 
Elliott (“Up in the Air”).

These early episodes focus on 

how Raylan is only doing this 
because of all of the investment he 
has put into the case. This aspect 
is the best of the season because 
of all the legwork that the show 
has put into constructing the 
relationship between Raylan and 
Boyd over the years. It helps that 
every time Olyphant and Goggins 
are on screen together, the scene 
crackles. They’re playing off of six 
years of tension, and it’s wonderful 
to see them on screen together. 

Incredibly, it’s still fascinating 

to watch these actors work; each 
of them has spent the past five 
years forming layered, interesting 
characters, a fact that shines 
in 
smaller 
scenes 
especially. 

Olyphant owns the role of Raylan: 
he wears his cowboy hat with 
charisma and poise. Dillahunt 
has the perfect mix of charm and 
menace in playing a villain, and 
Elliot, while he doesn’t get a major 
scene until the third episode, he 
makes it clear that his character is 
a force to be reckoned with.

The actor to benefit the most 

from this story is Carter. Last 
year, Ava was sent to a prison, 
an arc that didn’t completely 
work, playing out for too long and 
becoming repetitive. Having her 
character be a criminal informant 
gives Carter so much more to 
play with, requiring her to give a 
layered performance as Ava works 
to put away Boyd, which leads to 
some great results.

The amount of work that 

“Justified” has put in to build its 
characters and its world over the 
past five seasons has largely been 
under the radar during its run. 
Now that they’re starting to pay 
it off, it’s really good. The first few 
episodes hint at a final season that 
will be an amazing send-off for 
the show, even if it doesn’t quite 
match the heights of earlier 
seasons.

New Sleater-Kinney

TV REVIEW

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

According to Google, a riot grrrl 

(noun) is “a member of a movement 
of young feminists associated with 
aggressive 
punk-style rock 
music.” 

Sleater-

Kinney, 
a 

three-piece, 
all-female band 
at the core of 
this 
move-

ment, 
have 

a 
definition 

that’s 
much 

more their own. Bandmates Corin 
Tucker, Carrie Brownstein (“Port-
landia”) and Janet Weiss put the 
riot in the music, which is all of the 
following in no particular order 
(because disorder is punk): stun-
ningly angry, surprisingly melodic, 
boomingly soulful and downright 
badass. These ladies have been 
spilling jams of the aforemen-
tioned variety since 1994, riding 
and dominating the coattails of 
grunge and all its glory. And after 
a hiatus of nearly 10 years, their 
latest album is just as much of a 
triumph as 2005’s critically-adored 
The Woods. And their new album 
No Cities to Love doesn’t skip a beat.

Few bands can match Sleater-

Kinney’s energy, which is hyper 
and rife on their latest album. 
“Price Tag” is the best way they 
could have kicked off the care-
fully crafted 10-song tracklist. It’s 
catchy and rhythmic, smoothly 
catastrophic at parts, setting lofty 
expectations for its nine sister 
tunes who, actually, get better and 
better as the album continues. The 
brilliant “Fangless” soon follows, 
complete with great back-up vocals 
from Brownstein and a Strokes-
esque riff. It sounds like 

riot grrrl for the 21st century — a 

little more polished, more intricate, 
but still so hard. 

Each song wouldn’t be (and 

couldn’t be) complete, though, 
without lead singer Tucker’s deli-
ciously raw vocals. Her yawp 
devours every chord with the 
juxtaposed essence of grace and 
anger management; such soul can’t 
be taught. On “No Anthems” the 
listener gets her more subtle side 
in the verses, sexy whispers over 
Weiss’s roaring drums, but she 
comes around with that yell again 
and sets the whole track on fire. It’s 
great. Flavors of punk’s past guide 
her on “Bury Our Friends,” her 
slurred Clash-like pronunciation 
enhancing Sleater-Kinney’s street 
cred. And “Hey Darling,” probably 
the most conventional track on the 
album, blossoms into something 
truly melodic by the time Tucker 
hits the chorus. Here, if even for 
a few minutes, she shows us she 
can really sing by society’s work-
ing definition of “singing,” should 
she choose to abide by it. But that 
wouldn’t be very riot grrrl of her, 
now, would it?

As rooted as it is in punk, No Cit-

ies to Love is not lacking in inven-
tiveness. “Gimme Love,” arguably 
the best song on the album, show-
cases staccato guitars and vocals 

to match — its terseness is jarring 
in the niftiest way possible, pro-
gressing and following Tucker’s 
hajj to the pinnacle of lyrical angst. 
“A New Wave” and “Surface Envy” 
have classic-rock vibes and are 
refreshingly upbeat. Marked by 
songs like these, the album seems 
more alive than The Woods, more 
rocking and truer to Sleater-Kin-
ney’s origins — it’s less of them 
trying to fit to the times or mellow 
themselves out in accordance with 
their age. Even the titular track 
creates rad harmonies and prod-
ding drive. Take it from the pros: 
riot grrrls don’t get old.

The album only slows down 

with its concluding song, “Fade”— 
a wicked, eerie, swampy num-
ber that’s Tucker’s last catharsis. 
Heavy guitars and a creepy groove 
make it really cool to listen to, an 
appropriate yet imaginative way 
to end an impressive comeback 
record.

These three gals still sounds like 

a really good girl group jamming 
out in their basement in Olym-
pia, Washington in 1994, but with 
about 10 times more chutzpah, 
musicality and refined punk vigor. 
Is that the secret to success, or, 
moreover, (riot) girl power? Who 
knows. But it works like hell for 
Sleater-Kinney.

‘Eye Candy’ 
is MTV trash

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

MTV’s 
latest 
show 
“Eye 

Candy” stars Victoria Justice, a 
name familiar to anyone who’s 
watched Nick-
elodeon’s “Vic-
torious,” (or if 
they’re a half 
a decade older, 
“Zoey 
101”). 

After being a 
teenage 
star 

for the past 10 
years, 
Justice 

seems 
to 
be 

trying 
some-

thing new, something different, 
something edgier. In the begin-
ning of the premiere, it is doubt-
ful whether the almost 21-year 
old can pull it off; but by the end 
of the episode, after watching 
her discover two dead bodies 
and hack into databases illegally, 
viewers can have a little more 
faith in her — if not in the show. 

Justice plays Lindy Sampson, 

a young woman who possesses 
exceptional 
technical 
skills, 

which she uses to hack into the 
NYPD’s databases to find miss-
ing persons. While this appears a 
mere obsession to her coworkers 
and best friend Sophia (Kiersey 
Clemons, “Transparent”), this 
peculiarity stems from Samp-
son’s desire to find her kidnapped 
younger sister who was ripped 
from her life three years earlier. 
These illegal hacks get her in 
frequent trouble with the police, 
mediated only slightly by her 

complicated on-again, off-again 
relationship with Ben, an officer. 

When Sophia makes Lindy an 

account on Flirtual, a dating app 
that seems to function like Tin-
der, Lindy (under the name “Eye 
Candy”) draws the attention of 
a serial killer whom we never 
see. The resulting events — hid-
den cameras in her apartment, 
creepy text messages reminiscent 
of those on “Pretty Little Liars,” 
the gruesome murders of Ben 
and another man — strengthen 
Lindy’s resolve to find the psy-
chopath before he finds her. 
Justice still has a long way to go 
before her acting in “Eye Candy” 
can be considered above average, 
or even better than her past ven-
tures. Though she’s predictable 
and lacks in nuance at times, her 
performance is overall solid. 

Many of the plot devices are 

worn and transparent, and the 
lines 
feel 
overly 
illustrative, 

leaving viewers annoyed at hav-
ing explanations and superficial 
backstories thrust upon them. 
What makes this show relatively 
interesting, despite its evident 
flaws, is how it plays on real 
fears of society’s vulnerability 
to predators on the Internet — it 
sometimes feels like it is, as the 
serial killer says in a voice over, 
“God’s gift to psychopaths.” But 
the writers are going to have to 
focus more on depicting a scary 
but believable reality and less on 
unwarranted deaths, gruesome 
shots of bodies and unnecessar-
ily contrived quips if they want to 
hold onto their viewers.

Won’t remember 
FOB for centuries

ISLAND RECORDS

Thnks fr th mmrs vn thgh thy wrn’t s gd

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Fall Out Boy’s album 

disappointingly 

uneven

It is hard to believe that 10 

years have passed since Fall Out 
Boy’s claim-to-fame album From 
Under the Cork 
Tree 
spawned 

“Sugar, 
We’re 

Going 
Down,” 

“Dance, Dance” 
and “A Little 
Less 
Sixteen 

Candles, a Little 
More 
‘Touch 

Me.’ ” Over the 
past decade the 
band has strung 
together a hand-
ful of hits, ulti-
mately leading up to American 
Beauty / American Psycho. Even 
though it starts off strong, FOB’s 
sixth LP loses all of its energy, 
devolving into an unimaginative, 
messy love poem.

“Irresistible” opens the album 

with a punching beat and fantas-
tic verses. The lyrics are strong 
and catchy without being repeti-
tive in typical Fall Out Boy fash-
ion. The chorus is decent, but 
nothing spectacular; it holds 
through the initial cry, but loses 
energy through echoes. The title 
track comes next and is one of the 
band’s strongest dance anthems 
since “Dance, Dance.” Here, the 
echoes that lost energy on “Irre-
sistible” amp up the energy and 
carry the chorus seamlessly into 

the next verse, which are equally 
enjoyable. 

“Centuries,” the album’s lead 

single, is decent, but let’s make 
one thing clear — we will not 
remember this song for centuries 
(or even decades). Its most memo-
rable quality is the ephemeral and 
haunting intro; beyond that the 
verses’ strength in the aforemen-
tioned tracks is lost and replaced 
with confused and slightly creepy 
lyrics. “The bruises on your thighs 
like my fingerprints” comes off as 
abusive if anything.

Following 
the 
unmemora-

ble “Centuries,” FOB redeems 
themselves on “The Kids Aren’t 
Alright.” This track boasts the 
first completely satisfying chorus 
on the record. It is passionate, 
moving and the first time we see 
maturation in the band’s reper-
toire. Of course, that does not last 
long once the quick keyboard rings 
in on “Uma Thurman.” There are 
so many reasons to love this song 
(and not just the title). Its instru-
mental breaks are reminiscent of 
action movie montages and laced 
between quick and catchy verses 
and choruses that do not come off 
as “shouty” in the way some Fall 
Out Boy material does.

If you find yourself listening 

to American Beauty / American 
Psycho you should soak up all of 
the great qualities featured in 
“Uma Thurman” because it is 
downhill from there. “Jet Pack 
Blues” begins the album’s decline 
into a cocktail of undeveloped 
stories and floating metaphors. 
You know when you sing a song 
and you think a line is repeated 
once more than it is? “Baby Come 
Home” is similar. When you think 

the line is done, it is then repeated 
five more times. None of the rep-
etitions are more enjoyable than 
the previous and all the more 
frustrating. “Novocaine” offers 
no redemption; it is like literally 
drowning in metaphors and simi-
les. The task of understanding 
what the hell the song is trying 
to say revokes any enjoyment the 
music could bring.

Between “Jet Pack Blues,” 

“Novocaine” and the next track, 
“Fourth of July,” it is hard to 
understand where one track 
begins and the other ends. 
Searching 
for 
distinctions 

among these songs is fruitless. 
“Fourth of July” continues the 
metaphorical 
misfires 
with 

“You and I were fireworks, and 
we went off too soon.” Brilliant.

“Favorite 
Record” 
and 

“Immortal” 
follow, 
posing 

nothing new or interesting. 
Ridiculously overused or unin-
terrupted metaphors abundant; 
it all comes off as trying much 
too hard. The latter half of this 
record is far from immortal; it 
was pretty much dead on arriv-
al.

The record concludes with 

the slightly redeeming “Twin 
Skeletons.” It has well-timed 
instrumental breaks as not to 
drown the listeners in content 
as the previous tracks have. The 
dragged out crooning of “hold 
on” at this point is just too much. 
I let go about six songs ago.

American Beauty / American 

Psycho comes out of the gate on 
fire and ends in a ball of flames. 
It has two clear acts; take my 
advice and get the hell out dur-
ing intermission.

‘Paddington’ delights

FILM REVIEW

By JACOB RICH

Daily Film Editor

When I walked out of “The 

Grand Budapest Hotel” last 
March, I felt several conflict-
ing 
emotions. 

I was exuber-
ant, 
having 

just 
experi-

enced such a 
beautiful 
and 

absorbing film, 
but also some-
what sad, as I 
realized that I 
would have to 
wait another two years to get 
to experience another new Wes 
Anderson movie. 

Thanks 
to 
“Paddington,” 

I really only had to wait 10 
months. 

No, Anderson didn’t actually 

have anything to do with this 
film. But “Paddington” imitates 
the beautiful, creative imag-
ery that Anderson’s films are 
known for (complete with his 
quirky rule-of-thirds-breaking 
cinematographic style), while 
simultaneously 
and 
expertly 

emulating the innocent, non-
cynical and nostalgic emotional 
content of his kid-friendly films 
(like “Fantastic Mr. Fox” and 
“Moonrise Kingdom”). But it’s 
not just a Wes Anderson rip-off. 
“Paddington” carves out its own 
identity as a unique tale about 
immigration, and the hardships 
immigrants face when acclimat-
ing to their new surroundings.

“Paddington” is a screen 

adaptation of an extraordi-
narily popular icon of British 
children’s literature: Padding-
ton 
Bear. 
Paddington 
(Ben 

Whishaw, “Skyfall”) is a polite, 
hopeful and naïve to a fault 
young bear from “darkest” Peru, 
who, due to a series of tragic 
events, is sent by his aunt to 
find a new home in London. Its 
narrative champions the impor-
tance of immigrants to an urban 
society, and one of its villains 
(Peter Capaldi, “Doctor Who”) 
is an obvious parody of the far-
right anti-immigrant groups of 
the United Kingdom like the 
British National Party.

While the story is one of a 

political nature, the film never 
feels stuffy or overly preachy. 
On the contrary, this film is 
the shot of pure non-cynical 
warmth that the increasingly 
cynical world of children’s cin-
ema needs. “Paddington” is less 
concerned with minute-to-min-
ute laughs or beat-you-over-the-
head morals and more in love 
with cinematic beauty. Every 
shot is lavishly and individually 
treated as its own diorama of 
interesting objects, and part of 
the fun of the film is discovering 
what visual treats the filmmak-
ers have around every corner. 
Perhaps it’ll be a pointlessly 
complex steampunk-style filing 
system in the library, or a paint-
ing on the wall that animates 
to reflect the emotions of the 
house’s residents. “Paddington” 

is chock-full of these wonderful 
visual flourishes.

The narrative of “Padding-

ton” works because of its dis-
tinctly 
British 
sensibilities 

surrounding 
the 
potential 

absurdity of having human 
actors speak to a talking, cud-
dly bear. You’d expect a film like 
this to fall prey to the obvious 
set of jokes involving anthro-
pomorphic animals in film: 
the exclamations of finding “a 
real-life talking bear” and the 
inevitable slapstick humor to 
follow. It thankfully avoids that 
altogether by having the human 
characters 
quite 
amusingly 

just not care that Paddington 
happens to be a talking bear. 
This narrative choice cuts out 
unnecessary plot hang-ups and 
leads to some funny dialogue 
moments (“just keep walking, 
that bear is probably just selling 
something”).

It also works because of 

its superb technical sensibil-
ity with its CGI. Paddington, 
constructed of a blend of ani-
matronics and CGI, is a techni-
cal accomplishment, and looks 
far less out of place strolling 
through London than the half-
CGI 
dwarves 
did 
stomping 

around Middle Earth in the 
recent “Hobbit” movies.

“Paddington” is an expert 

piece of children’s cinema. It’s a 
shame it likely won’t be as popu-
lar in the Americas as it will be 
in the UK, because its simple 
beauty is universal.

‘Seeking Woman’ is 
creative & hilarious

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

Ever hear that someone is liter-

ally Hitler? Hyperboles are a com-
mon but powerful part of speech: 
They can con-
vey 
sadness, 

frustration and 
excitement 
as 

language 
that 

makes everyday 
occurrences 
larger 
than 

life. In FXX’s 
new 
comedy 

“Man 
Seek-

ing 
Woman,” 

hyperbole 
becomes real as 
the fantastic and surreal go hand-
in-hand with the mundane, creat-
ing a unique perspective for the 
TV romantic comedy.

The show opens with Josh 

Greenberg (Jay Baruchel, “This 
Is the End”) parting ways with 
his girlfriend of four years (or six 
if you count the e-mailing), Mag-
gie (Maya Erskine, “Betas”). Josh 
shows a quiet sense of defeat as he 
tries to keep open opportunities 
with Maggie, as the two decide 
if they might be able to be bud-
dies. Josh walks away followed 
by his own personal raincloud. 
The raincloud is the first of the 
magical reality moments in the 
episode. By using such a common 
image, “Man Seeking Woman” 
preps itself to dive into the absurd 
world that it has created.

Josh’s sister Liz (Britt Lower, 

“Unforgettable”) sets him up 
with a friend from Sweden, only 
to learn the friend is an absolute 
troll – a troll as in being born in 
the Scandinavian Forest and “she 
moved here last year so she could 
run her nonprofit and live under-
neath the Wabash Bridge.” 

Creator Simon Rich, a former 

writer for “Saturday Night Live,” 
has adapted his own short story 
collection “The Last Girlfriend 
on Earth” into “Man Seeking 
Woman.” There’s definitely a 
sense of Rich’s sketch and short 
story writing influences in the 
show with most of major events of 
supernatural comedy forming the 
meat of the episode. Rich takes 
tropes associated with roman-
tic comedies and inserts enough 
insanity and exaggeration to 
make the situations enjoyably 
clever. 

Interspersed between are more 

grounded moments in Josh’s life 
as he tries to gain his confidence 
back. However, some of these 
moments feel like they’re just bid-
ing time untill the next comedic 
set piece. These bits are aided 
though by the efforts of Baruchel 
who makes Josh more than a sad 
sack who hasn’t been laid in a 
while. Josh’s efforts show heart, 
and that makes it saddening to see 
him try and fail.

In a world where the extremes 

of ideas exist, Baruchel serves as 
the straight man to the absurd 
happenings around him. This is 
best seen when he attends a party 
hosted by Maggie and her new 
boyfriend who is literally Hitler 

(an unrecognizable Bill Hader, 
“Saturday Night Live”). In the 
world of “Man Seeking Woman,” 
the crazy events are accepted 
as normal by most characters, 
and Josh is the only occasional 
detracting voice, “I thought he 
died like, years ago?” Josh ques-
tions, only for his friend Mike 
(Eric André, “Don’t Trust the B in 
Apartment 23”) to answer, “Nah, 
he faked that. Yeah, he’s been hid-
ing in Argentina since, like, the 
‘40s.”

By using common exaggera-

tions and spinning them into a real 
world setting Rich has created 
an insane but relatable universe. 
Even though Josh’s experiences 
veer into the preposterous, there 
are still the common struggles 
of getting over a relationship or 
reclaiming one’s self-confidence 
to tie fantasy to reality. 

It’s hard seeing Josh stumble 

and fail in such large ways that 
it is a relief to see him succeed 
when he gets the phone number 
of a woman called Laura (Vanessa 
Bayer, another “SNL” cast mem-
ber). The corresponding response 
by the show’s universe is uplift-
ing. Even though life’s difficul-
ties can seem larger than life, the 
smallest victories can bring us 
insurmountable joy.

Wolverines fail to 
pull off road upset

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

Thursday, 
the 
momentum 

that has carried the Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team 
through 
its last two conference wins 
appeared once again in the final 
minutes against Iowa.

Senior 
forward 
Cyesha 

Goree led the charge with 26 
points and 13 rebounds, and for 
a time it looked as though her 
performance would be enough 
to help the Wolverines claw their 
way out of a 15-point second-half 
deficit.

Michigan 
(4-3 
Big 
Ten, 

12-6 overall) had been given a 
golden opportunity to upset the 
20th-ranked 
Hawkeyes, 
who 

missed several shots in the final 
minutes of the game to open 
up the door for victory. But the 
Wolverines’ mishaps caught up 
to them again, as they had for 
most of the game, and led to a 
76-70 loss.

“We couldn’t get stops when 

we needed to get stops,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “We got down a little bit 
and we kind of battled back, but 
we were never really able to get 
over the top. We started out slow 
again shooting and did a better 
job in the second half.”

Guards Melissa Dixon and 

Ally Disterhoft led the charge 
for Iowa (6-1, 15-3), with 16 and 
14 
points, 
respectively. 
The 

Hawkeyes’ offense capitalized 
on easily sneaking in behind 
Michigan’s man-to-man defense. 

So with two and a half 

minutes left, Katelynn Flaherty 
came in to help. With her team 
down by seven, the freshman 
guard received the ball at the 
top of the key and knocked 

down a triple. Once again, it 
looked like Flaherty — who 
scored 19 points — could salvage 
a sloppy performance from her 
teammates.

But after Iowa center Bethany 

Doolittle missed a shot, senior 
guard Shannon Smith took it 
coast-to-coast for a fast-break 
basket, but the play was nullified 
because of a travel call.

After two more Hawkeye 
 

misses with a pair of Goree free 
throws in between, Smith took it 
down the court once more and 
passed it to an open Flaherty, 
positioned to make another 
clutch 3-pointer and bring the 
game to within a point.

But Smith had stepped out of 

bounds, and the whistle blew. 
With just a little bit more than 
one minute left, she stood at 
midcourt motionless. It was the 
moment the Wolverines needed 
to be errorless, but with the game 
on the line, the line was exactly 
what cost them a chance for 
victory.

Michigan failed to make an 

impact in the first half due to 
bad passing while facing an 
aggressive 2-3 zone from Iowa, 
forcing the Wolverines out of the 
key.

Reverting 
to 
shooting 

3-pointers wasn’t the solution, 
however, as Michigan went 
0-for-7, failing to score from the 
perimeter until four minutes 
into the second half with the 
help of sophomore guard Siera 
Thompson — who combined 
with Flaherty for five triples.

The 
woeful 
23.8-percent 

3-point 
shooting 
prevented 

the Wolverines from starting 
strong, making the comeback 
an uphill battle. And unlike in 
Michigan’s last two wins, the 
shots did not fall often enough 
in the end to reverse the Wol-
verines’ fortunes.

‘M’ hopes to avoid weekend letdown

By JEREMY SUMMITT 

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan hockey team 

carries the nation’s top offense 
and a five-game winning streak 
into 
this 

weekend’s 
series 
at 

Wisconsin, 
but 
glaring 

concerns 
still 

linger.

While 
the 

Wolverines’ 
offense 
has 

been 
busy 

putting pucks 
in the back of 
the net at an 
alarming rate 
— 
averaging 

6.16 goals per 
game in conference play — the 
defense has fallen by the wayside.

In the past three games, 

they have conceded 14 goals. 
Such porous defense usually 
isn’t a recipe for success, but 
the unusual scoring rate has 
simultaneously kept Michigan 
(5-1 Big Ten, 13-7 overall) afloat.

“We’ve got away with it 

because we’ve been able to score 
more goals than we gave up, 
but we can’t keep playing like 
that,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “We’ve got to play 
better without the puck.”

Typically, a weekend trip to 

Madison would be the last place 
a team could safely shore up 
defensive concerns, but this year 
is an outlier. The Badgers (0-3-
1, 2-13-3) have had a historically 
poor season, and this series 
represents a golden opportunity 
for the Wolverines to tighten 
their play in their own zone.

A combination of factors have 

led to the lackluster defensive 
play, including a shaky penalty-
killing unit that is achieving just 
an 80.6 percent success rate this 
season. Making matters worse, 
senior forward Travis Lynch, a 
critical piece of the penalty-kill 

unit, broke his right hand two 
weeks ago against Minnesota.

“I think it’s our whole team,” 

Berenson said. “We’ve given 
up goals too easily. Our penalty 
killing has been a part of it. 
It’s been our D-zone coverage, 
which was just lax, and then it’s 
been weak goals on our goalies.”

And though this weekend 

seems like the best opportunity 
to erase those concerns from 
his mind — and it very well 
could be — Berenson feels that 
Wisconsin is a legitimate threat 
to play conference spoiler. In 
past weeks, the Badgers have 
earned points against three 
ranked opponents in Michigan 
Tech, Boston University and 
Minnesota, all teams Michigan 
has played tight games against.

In fact, they’ve lost just 

three of their last six games, 
respectable for a team that has 
just two wins. Despite a recent 
upswing, Wisconsin still ranks 
among the bottom 10 programs 
in the nation for team defense 
(3.61 goals per game) and team 
offense (1.78).

This 
weekend 
functions 

as more of a trap for the 
Wolverines than anything else. 
Avoiding a loss to the lowly 
Badgers will be instrumental 
in maintaining a strong RPI 
ranking, the main factor that the 
NCAA Tournament selection 
committee uses in determining 
the 16-team field.

Last 
season, 
Michigan 

dropped three games to Penn 
State, a team that won just eight 
total games. If the Wolverines 
had won only one, maybe two, of 
those contests, they would have 
likely snuck their way into the 
tournament.

That being said, Berenson 

has preached to his team how 
necessary it will be to take six 
points back from Madison. So to 
avoid any more what-ifs or could-
haves at the end of this season, 
Michigan needs to take care of 
business when it’s expected to.
