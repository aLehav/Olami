Despite winning its fourth
consecutive Big Ten regular-
season championship, the No. 6
Michigan women's tennis team
will enter the NCAA Tourna-
ment with a bitter taste in its
mouth. The Wolverines ended
their dominant season with a loss
in the Big Ten tournament cham-
pionship - for the ninth-straight
time.
Luckily the season doesn't end
there.
Despite the loss, Michi-
gan (10-1 Big Ten, 21-5 overall)
secured its 12th-straight NCAA
Tournament bid and earned
home court advantage for the
first and second rounds.
"It's huge playing at home,"
said junior Brooke Bolender. "It's
awesome to be hosting. We are
more confortable and have huge
crowds, which always gets us
energized."
The Wolverines earned the
No. 10 seed, and on May 10th,
they'll play IPFW (23-7) in the
first round. Notre Dame (17-8)
and NC State (14-9) are also in the
same region. The winners of each
match will face each other with a
Sweet 16 berth on the line. Michi-
gan has made it to the Sweet 16
three years in a row.
The Wolverines will look
to their strong doubles play to
move them through the regional
rounds. Michigan is 17-0 when
winning the doubles point and
just 3-5 without it. The Wolver-
ines look to their No. 6-ranked
duo of Bolender and sophomore
Emina Bektas to lead the way.
"It's the way we play,"Bolender
said. "We play very aggressive

and both move forward as much
as we can, which is not what most
women teams do. When we do
this, we put a lot of pressure on
our opponents."
On top of the doubles, Michi-
gan's singles lineup has proven
to be elite, with five Wolverines
earning at least 20 wins. At the
top is reliable No. 1 singles player
Bektas, who is the reigning two-
time Big Ten player of the week.
But perhaps the greatest addi-
tion to this year's squad is fresh-
man Ronit Yurovsky. The Big Ten
Freshman of the Year, owns 30
wins, and has eased the pressure
for the rest of the team.
Michigan has also shown a lot
of depth, which could spell trou-
bleforIPFW. FreshmanAmyZhu
has grinded out several three-set
matches this year, and earned 20
wins for the Wolverines.
Michigan has been steady
throughout the year, and even
after historic wins, the team has
remained in check. Bolender
attributes a lot of the team's suc-
cess to its coach, Ronni Bern-
stein, who recently earned her
fourth-straight Big Ten Coach of
the Year award.
"First and foremost, she
emphasizes playing for the team,"
Bolender said. "A lot of coaches
make it about them, but she gives
us the responsibility. When she
gives us the responsibility to
motivate ourselves, we really
play for the seven people around
us. She's extremely encouraging
and always positive."
It's clear Michigan has the
weapons to succeed and IPFW is
the next test.
Bolender said it best: "It's do or
die and we have to leave it all on
the court."

Reports of
suspicious
behavior
on the rise
UMPD: Increase
likely due to April
safety bulletin
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily StaffReporter
After multiple reports of suspi-
cious, unwanted sexual behavior
around campus, University Police
spokeswoman Diane Brown said
though the incidents seem to be
unrelated, there appears to be an
ongoing trend.
The University released a safety
bulletin in April detailing sev-
eral reports of suspicious behav-
ior of a man in the North Campus
area. The reports listed said a man
approached several women sepa-
rately tellingthem they were pretty
and asking them on a date.
A suspect was identified and
interviewed by a University Police
officer and was left with a warning
that his behavior was disturbing
to others and was asked to refrain
from acting suspiciously in the
future.
Brown said the University Police
released the safety bulletin because
the reports "indicated that the peo-
ple were extremely uncomfortable"
with the suspect's behavior. His
actions, Brown added, were more
intimidating than ifa person asked
another to go on a date with them,
for example.

Class of 2013
graduates more
than 5,000 students
By ADAM RUBENFIRE and

Daily StaffReporters
At a 50,000-person event that
was hardly improvised, the spring
2013 University graduates lis-
tened to Twitter CEO Dick Cos-
tolo as he spoke about the value
of improvisation and living in the
moment.
More than 5,000 graduating
students took to the Big House
on Saturday for commencement

under sunny skies and a light
wind. The video scoreboards dis-
played recorded messages from
graduating students and tweets
with #MGoGrad, fitting for an
event headlined by the chief exec-
utive of hashtags.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman gave remarks and
presented honorary degrees
on behalf of the University's
Board of Regents to Pulitzer-
prize-winning historian David
McCullough, University alum and
philanthropist William Brehm,
famed ballerina Suzanne Farrell
and University alum Rosabeth
Kanter, a business professor at
Harvard University.
Coleman's address challenged

graduates to follow in the path of
historic University alumni: "You
will create change for the better,
you will work on behalf of your
neighbors, and you will do it with
dignity and integrity."
Costolo, a 1985 University
graduate, began his address -
which he jokingly said he began
planning for Saturday morning
- by taking a quick iPhone pic-
ture to tweet out to his 1 million
followers, thanking his parents
and reminding graduates to thank

their education.

Campus smoking
rate on the decline

Two years after ban,
students and faculty
report positive impact
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily Staff Reporter
A survey conducted to gauge
the success of the University's
smoking ban two years after its
implementation shows promising
results for those favoring a smoke-
free campus.
According to the survey - which
was completed by 2,022 students
and 2,405 faculty and staff - 82.7
percent of students and 88.8 percent
of faculty and staff said they sup-
ported the existence of the smoke-
free campus policy. Additionally, 72
percent of faculty and 65 percent of
students reported that they noticed
a decrease in smoking on campus
since the policy's implementation.
Prior to the smoking ban in
2011, the University of Michigan
Substance Abuse Research Center
performed a Student Life Survey
to gain information on student and
faculty smoking habits. According
to a follow-up survey performed in
November, the percentage of faculty
and staff who self-reported smoking
decreased from 6 percent in the 2011
survey to 4 percent.
The decision to implement a
smoke-free initiative on campus

was made by Dr. Robert Winfield,
University chief health officer
and director of University Health
Services, alongwithother executive
health officers.
"The goal of a smoke-free campus
is to create a healthier campus that
sets a good example for students
passing through, and promotes
health and wellness for them in the
future," Winfield said.
He said in the past, smoking
hotspots included the benches
around the Diag, the side entrance
of the Union and the libraries on
North Campus and Central Cam-
pus. He said there's been a "95 per-
cent" decrease in activity around
these areas since the ban went into
effect.
In the year and a half prior to the
implementation of the initiative,
surveys and focus groups identified
how people felt about smoking in
general and how frequently people
smoked on campus.
"We wanted to identify what
kinds of issues were really most
important to the campus, including
faculty, staff and students," Win-
field said.
The fact that the ban uses social
norms and pressure rather than
legal measures to enforce the rules
was an important decision for Win-
field and the creators of the smoke-
free initiative.

The Michigan baseball team's
offense has been dormant recent-
ly, but the Wolverines woke up
to unleash two huge offensive
innings en route to a 7-0 victory
over Toledo (12-15 MAC, 19-27
overall) on Wednesday.
It didn't take long, either.
Junior
center field- TOL EDO 0
er Michael MICHIGAN 7
O'Neill got
things going with a hard double to
left field after senior second base-
man Patrick Biondi was hit by a
pitch to lead off the game. Biondi
immediately left the game with a
back injury, and was replaced by
sophomore second baseman Eric
Jacobson. Michigan coach Erik
Bakich said he was still gather-
ing details from the team trainer
regarding Biondi's status.
"He's as tough as they come,"
Bakich said. "But he took a hit by
pitch in the back, so that's never
good."
After Biondi left the game,
the Wolverines (10-8 Big Ten,
25-22) soon loaded the bases
with no outs and the runs quickly
followed. An inability to take
advantage of runners in scoring
position has been a consistent
offensive liability this season, but
there weren't many signs of that
on Wednesday.
Freshman designated hit-
ter Jacob Cronenworth scored
Jacobson on a groundout to first
base, and O'Neill reached home
off a passed ball on the next play.
Sophomore right fielder Kevin
White hit a deep ball to left-
center, but settled for a sacrifice
fly before a double steal scored
sophomore left fielder Zach Zott
to conclude the inning.
White slugged a pitch over the
left-field wall for a three-run shot
in his next at-bat to cap off the
most productive offensive perfor-
mance of any Wolverine. He went
2-for-3 with a run and four RBI
on the evening.
"I simplified everything and
slowed it down today," White
said. "I was a little more selective
and just got better pitches to hit
instead of chasing pitches that
the pitchers wanted me to hit."

On Wednesday, seven mem-
bers of the Michigan softball team
proved they do more than just win
games - they win awards.
As she has done in so many
games this year, freshman short-
stop Sierra Romero knocked the
competition out of the park, earn-
ing both Big Ten Freshman of the
Year and Player of the Year honors.
Romero is just the second fresh-
man to win both awards, joining
Michigan's Sara Griffin who earned
the distinction in 1995. Romero
follows in the footsteps of former
Michigan first baseman Amanda
Chidester, who won Player of the
Year in 2011 and 2012.
The Murrieta, Calif. native has
been hailed by Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins since she stepped
onto campus in August, even draw-
ing comparisons to Detroit Tigers'
slugger, Prince Fielder.
"She has the quickest hands I've
ever seen," Hutchins said. "If you
watched her in the fall you would
have known it there. She has a
tremendous presence both in our
offensive lineup and on the field."
Romero finished the regular
season batting .397 with a slug-
ging percentage of .897, 66 RBI and
a program-record 22 home runs.
During conference play, the short-
stop strung together a 14-game hit-
ting streak. An additional 42 walks
put Romero on base in each confer-
ence game, earning her a stagger-
ing .534 on-base percentage. Her
62 hits is tied with junior first base-
man Caitlin Blanchard and senior
second baseman Ashley Lane for
the team lead - a lethal combina-
tion at the heart of the Michigan
batting order.
"It's great how we've kept it
going one after another," Romero
said. "We're very contagious. It can
be good and it can't be bad, but late-
lyit'sbeen workingforus and we're
rolling with it. It's been fun."
Lane and Blanchard were two of
six Wolverines named to the first-
team All-Big Ten team.
Blanchard's hot midseason hit-
tingmade herthe natural fitbehind
Romero in the lineup, while her
.981 fielding percentage at first base
kept her from playing her original
position, catcher, all season. The
junior led the league with 33 hits in
conference play, while batting .452

'M' rakes in awards

with three home runs and 26 RBI.
"I relish hitting in any opportu-
nity, and it'sgreat if you want to put
one more runner on," Blanchard
said. "We have a saying in the dug-
out that's pretty simple: 'Walks are
good.' Even if it's Sierra getting
intentionally walked, that's one
more base runner for our team so
of course we're goingto take that."
Behind Blanchard in the cleanup
spot, Lane batted .411 in conference
play with seven home runs and 28
RBI. She slugged .740 She finished
tied for second in the league with
seven home runs and third in both
RBI and hits (30).
Sophomore catcher Lauren
Sweet rounded out the infield
selections thanks to an offensive
surge in conference play. Despite
hitting just .079 through the first
half of the season - her first hit
didn't come until the final week of
non-conference play - Sweet bat-
ted just shy of .500 through 22 Big
Ten games.
Whereas sophomore pitcher
Haley Wagner - who was chosen
second-team All-Big Ten - stole
the show last year, sophomore
right-hander Sara Driesenga rep-
resents the Wolverines' pitching
with first-team honors this season.
An early-season injury to Wagner
allowed Driesenga to step up as
Michigan's ace, a role in which she
performed admirably. The Hud-
sonville, Mich. native struck out 68
batters in 63 innings and boasted a
2.65 ERA with a 9-1 record.
Freshman left fielder Sierra
Lawrence joins Romero as the only
two freshmen to make the first
team. She batted .429 with seven
doubles and four home runs to
compile a .730 slugging percentage.
She knocked in 22 runs and stole
three bases, and remained perfect
in the field with a 1.000 fielding
percentage.
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins
- who won her 3,000th game ear-
lier this season - was awarded her
third-consecutive Coach of the
Year honor, as voted on by her fel-
low coaches in the Big Ten.
"Obviously, it shows I've been
here a long time and I'm really
lucky that way," Hutchins said.
"You don't see many people have
that. It means we've had good play-
ers and good staff. We've had a lot
of good players come through here
and certainly my assistants make
all the difference in the world."

PAUL SHERMAN/Daly
Junior center fielder Michael O'Neill went 2-ftr-5 with a run on Wednesday.

staff performed admirably as
well. After they were roughed up
on Tuesday, Bakich used a boun-
ty of pitchers in this game, and
the right-handed combination
of sophomore James Bourque,
senior Kyle Clark and freshman
Alex Daar never disappoint-
ed. The trio combined to pitch
a remarkable seven scoreless
innings, allowing just three hits
and striking out four.
"We wanted to use Bourque
and Clark," Bakich said. "They
could only go two because that
enables both of them to come
back on Friday. We needed to
save our pitching as best we can
for the weekend. They did a great
job of holding their offense down
and attacking the strike zone."
Sophomore right-hander Don-
nie Eaton and senior right-hand-
er Chad Jasman finished out the
game in the eighth and ninth,
respectively. The entire pitching

staff, from Bourque to Jasman,
did a superb job at attacking the
Toledo batters in the strike zone,
staying away from too many full
counts and forcing contact early
in opposing at-bats. Utilizing
both sides of the plate kept oppos-
ing batters on edge and prevented
the Rockets from stringing qual-
ity at-bats together in any inning.
The Wolverines certainly
needed the momentum boost
stemming from the victory as
they head into a crucial series
with Purdue this weekend. With
an at-large berth to the NCAA
Tournament slowly creeping out
of reach barring a sweep of the
remaining schedule, Michigan
will need to rely on making the
Big Ten Tournament and eventu-
ally emerging victorious. Getting
back on track both offensively
and with outstanding pitching
performances couldn't have come
at a better time.

taking an acting class his senior
year. It turned out to be more than
"saying Arthur Miller lines to each

the next semester and began stand-

Costolo offered the picture-

is you're experiencing it in the
moment, if you try to plan what the
next line will be, you're just going
to be disappointed," he said.
To end his often humorous
remarks, Costolo invoked myriad
careers University graduates
would pursue and had advice no
matter where they end up: "Be
right there, and nowhere else, in
that moment. Soak it all it. And
remember to say thank you."
In an interview after
commencement, Costolo said, "You
have this intellectual sense of how
big the crowd is, but until you go
out there and experience it, you
don't really have an appreciation
for it."
"You have to have a north
star," he said of the path - or
lack thereof - he endorsed, "but
you can't constantly worry about,
'Well, and then I'm supposed to
do this,' because life doesn't work
that way and you won't experience
your life. You'll be living it in
service to some expectations that
are fiction."
LSA graduate Anisha Chadha
was the only student speaker on
Saturday. Though she came to
the University concerned about
how she would feel among some
25,000 undergraduates, Chadha
said joining student organizations
allowed her to create a small,
unique community on campus.
"I realized, no matter what
we were doing, it was almost
impossible for me to feel small,"
Chadha said in her address. "Even
when I was in this Big House, with
114,803 other people, I began to
realize that what I was feeling
was not smallness, but rather I
was feeling like I was a part of
somethingbigger than myself."
Though most use the term
"Michigan Difference" to describe
the academic and cultural caliber of
the University, Chadha explained it
as the impact Michigan graduates
can have on humanity.
"It is the difference we were
given the opportunity to make,"
Chadha said. "It is the knowledge,
the empathy and the skills we
have gained here that are needed
to be able to make a thoughtful
difference in the lives of others."
As she concluded her speech,
Chadha reminded her fellow
graduates that they represent
the University and the power
of its graduates in their future
endeavors.
"Always remember: you are
contributing to our class's 'Michi-
gan Difference' and the differ-
ence made by all of the Wolverines
before us."

BEHAVIOR
From Page 1
Brown said she believes there
has been an increase in reports
of suspicious behavior due to the
release of the safety bulletin in
April. She added that people are
now offering this information
to University Police while it
may have been less reported
previously.
Because the suspects for each
of these incidents do not match
in description, Brown said rather
than a sudden trend of suspicious
behavior occurring, the trend
lies within the increase of people
reportingthe behaviors.
In a recent incident, a man -
described as white, in his 60s,

5'5" to 57" and with white hair -
approached pedestrians on State
Street and asked them on dates.
While the University Police were
unable to locate the suspect, his
description does not match that
of the suspect from the North
Campus incidents.
Brown added that upon receiv-
ing a report, University Police offi-
cers go to the scene to attempt to
find a potential suspect. In most
cases no actual crime incidents
may have occurred and these
acts of suspicious behavior do not
warrant an ongoing investigation
from the University Police.
If approached with suspicious
behavior, Brown said to imme-
diately call the University Police
and provide a description of the
suspect.

Researchers decode
molecular message
leading to spread of
malignant cells
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
In a School of Dentistry lab
on North University Avenue,
researchers have discovered
what could eventually change
the way doctors treat cancer.
In a study published Tuesday
in the online journal Nature
Communications, Dentistry
Prof. Russell Taichman and
Research Associate Younghun
Jung have deciphered the
molecular messages that cause
certain cancers to spread.
Taichman's lab studies how
cancer spreads to bone marrow
as well as ways in which stem
cells can be used to regenerate
bone. The research is significant
in the School of Dentistry
because bone regeneration
is often crucial in dental
procedures.
Jung, who is involved in
research in both areas, decided to
join the two sets of experiments
rather than perform the studies
separately.
Both malignant and benign
tumors emit distress signals to
SMOKING

Violating the regulations of the
smoke-free initiative is a violation
of the Statement of Student
Rights and Responsibilities. A
student who breaks the rules and
is reported by another student
or staff member must report to
the Office of Student Conflict
Resolution.
The ban has remained a con-
troversial issue since its incep-
tion, hailed by some opponents as
an infringement on personal free-
dom. Among other problems, an
opinion article in The Michigan
Daily from March said a smoke-
free campus that takes away ash-
trays for smokers to use leads to

recruit healing cells, or very
small embryonic-like stem cells.
While studying the effect of
VSEL stem cells in rehabilitating
human bones inserted in mice,
Jung decided to include a tumor
in the experiment to see how the
VSEL cells would interact. In
the initial trial, Jung found the
tumor contained a huge amount
of the healing cells.
"I was ecstatic to find that
they do, in fact, interact with
each other," Jung wrote in an
e-mail interview. "As a scientist,
I get excited just by coming up
with new ideas and theories to
test. But when the data seems to
support these ideas, it is really
something else."
After almost three years of
research, Taichman and Jung have
been able to discover what draws
the healing cells to a tumor. While
a collaborator at the University of
Louisville first identified VSEL
cells, Taichman and Jungwere the
first to study them in tumors and
pinpoint the role the cells play in
the spread of cancer.
When a tumor develops,
the tumor produces a protein
that draws the VSEL stem cells
inside. Then, the VSEL cells turn
into a second type of cell known
as cancer associated fibroblasts.
Those cells produce a protein
that makes cancer cells more
aggressive, allowing them to
spread to other parts of the body.
an increase in littering. That said,
there are some designated ash-
trays around campus.
Another issue commonly
reported is uncertainty about the
boundaries of the ban. Though
Winfield said the ban has been
largely successful, there have
been a handful of people who take
advantage of the relatively lax
rules.
Rather than turn to law
enforcement, Winfield would pre-
fer to solve the issue more amica-
bly.
"Some are angry about the
rules, defiant, not aware or don't
care and are taking advantage of
the fact that we're using light-
weight enforcement," he said.
"My first preference is to improve
signage and advertising."

By understanding the ways
in which stem cells interact
with a tumor and cause cancer
to spread, researchers can now
study methods through which to
block VSEL cells from interact-
ing with a tumor. Additionally,
high VSEL cell levels in a blood
test could potentially serve as a
diagnostic meter for detecting
cancer earlier.
Taichman said it is possible
that further research in block-
ing VSELs could potentially cre-
ate a cure for cancer. Currently,
Taichman's lab is attempting to
find inhibitors to block the cells
as he applies for further fund-
ing to continue the research
and approval for human trials.
Jung said the next steps involve
investigating the healing cells'
interaction throughout the pro-
gression of a cancerous tumor.
However, Taichman said
many scientists still debate the
existence of VSEL stem cells
due to their small size and the
difficulties associated with
identifying them.
Taichman said reviewers
may also question whether
the findings will remain true
in other types of cancers.
Cancerous prostate tumors are
typically used in Taichman's
lab because they often spread
to other parts of the body, such
as bones. The lab has also tested
breast cancer tumors.
Lena Gray, the smoke-free
environment project coordinator
for Michigan Healthy Commu-
nity, said in a press release that
smoking is still an issue on Cen-
tral Campus.
"We are pursuing other
approaches such as adding sig-
nage and sidewalk chalk messag-
es, to remind everyone that those
areas are smoke-free," Gray said.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman convened a Smoke-
Free Advisory Committee at the
inception of the ban that meets
regularly to address issues such
as littering and boundary recog-
nition.
There are currently 1,159 com-
pletely smoke free campuses -
including the University - across
the U.S.

Poor execution
'U' administration mishandled student seating change
n April 22, University students learned that student seating at football
games for the 2013 season will be conducted under a general admission
policy. This policy is different from previous years, where the number
of accumulated credits determined how close to the field a student's tickets were.
Many students have voiced their opposition to general admission, and a petition
on the University's UPetition site calling for a gradual implementation of the new
seating arrangement has garnered nearly 3,600 signatures. While the Athletic
Department's decision to have general admission for football games shouldn't be
problematic in the long run, the manner in which the department is implement-
ing general admission leaves much to be desired.

Ann Arbor atmosphere

Twists, laughs
in Iron Man 3'

ne morning, I was at Biggby Cof-
fee on East Liberty Street work-
ing on a Spanish assignment.
It was the midst of
winter; most people
ordered hot cocoa_
that morning to warm -
up. It was 9 o'clock in
the morning - one of
the most hectic times
in an average Ameri- _
can's day. While I
was stressing about SARA
my assignment that SHOUHAYIB
was due a few short
hours later, I noticed
a girl crying at the corner table of the cof-
fee shop. She was sitting alone bundled up
in her winter gear with her face nestled
in her hands. As she was quietly whimper-
ing, a middle-aged woman gently tapped
the girl on the shoulder asking if she was
all right. "Do you need a hug?" the woman
asked. The girl accepted the offer, and they
embraced for a few short moments as if they
were mother and daughter. The woman lent
the girl a few last consoling words and then
took off for her day. A minute later the girl
packed up her stuff and did the same. She
wasn't crying anymore. In fact, she walked
out with a smile. It was in that moment I felt
the world would be a better place if it were
like Ann Arbor, Mich.
I thought about all the random things
the city showcases that make me smile, like
the violin-playing wolf. Or the guy that sits
outside of the UGLi knee slappingand play-
ing the harmonica. I learned last year that
he's actually a professor at the University.
That fact alone makes me smile.
How about the fact that you can walk
everywhere? Not only is it convenient for
those of us who don't have cars, but it also
works off all of the unwanted calories, like
the Amer's frozen yogurt that we all so
shamelessly indulge in. The city not only
forces you to exercise when walking to
places, but it also accommodates all kinds
of fun and adventure. Take the Nichols
Arboretum for example: the winding foot-
hills and trails are a runner's dream, where
all the day's stress melts away. It's even a
great place for those who want to picnic in
the fields away from the hustle and bustle
of downtown. And if you're lucky you might
even be able to catch a Quidditch match
or witness two lovers sneaking kisses on a
romantic walk. It's the hidden gem of the
city that everyone can find ause for.
When you're in the city, you may
notice a variety of languages being spo-
ken around you - you can hear every-
thing from Mandarin to Greek, showing
that Ann Arborites are exceptionally

well-rounded and culturally aware. The
worldly experience doesn't end there.
The city hosts multiple restaurants that
serve various international cuisines. The

best part is, it doesn't eat away at

There are several aspects
of general admission seating
that, while different from the
past, will benefit students. All
students now have the chance
to sit wherever they want in
the student section, provided
that they arrive early enough
to the stadium. As a result,
students can freely move
around the stands and sit in
whatever group they desire
without having to sign up
for group tickets beforehand
or having to dodge ushers.
Moreover, Athletic Direc-
tor David Brandon's stated
reason for going to general
admission in the first place
was to ensure that more stu-
dents show up to the start
of the football game. If this
logic plays out in practice, the
atmosphere in the student
section on game days should
become even more energetic
and enjoyable, with more stu-
dents showing up to support
the team.
However, this change
should have been handled

differently. Regardless of
his goals, the way Bran-
don chose to implement the
general admission policy
is disrespectful to return-
ing students. The Athletic
Department announced the
policy change at the start of
the 12-day window in which
students could purchase
season tickets, coinciding
with the already busy end
of the semester. The depart-
ment also chose not to con-
sult the student body. Had
the department announced
their intention to change the
seating policy at an earlier
date, students who oppose
the policy change would've
had the chance to voice their
opposition and suggest alter-
natives along the lines of the
petition before they had to
buy tickets. Most disappoint-
ingly, the Athletic Depart-
ment deprived seniors of a
time-honored privilege with-
out their consent.
Implementing this policy
change in a way that will

ensure student safety and
streamline the process of
getting into the stadium on
game days should be a prior-
ity for the University as the
football season approaches.
Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity - a school with general
admission - has allowed
their students to camp out
days in advance in order to
get one of the first few spots
in line for the student sec-
tion. This is just one of the
contingencies that Univer-
sity administration must pre-
pare for next fall, along with
long lines outside of the sta-
dium well in advance of the
game and students jockeying
for seats during the game.
While general admission
has numerous benefits, its
abrupt introduction was ill-
advised. University admin-
istration, particularly the
Athletic Department, must
now ensure the switch to
general admission doesn't
adversely affect the game day
experience this fall.

Main Street is the place for you. The point
is the options are limitless, and the beau-
ty of Ann Arbor is you don't have to go to
Thailand to taste Thai food - you can do
that just by walking a few blocks.
Also within walking distance are great
shopping experiences for an entire family.
From toy stores to sex shops, downtown
Ann Arbor has it. It's the perfect paradox
exemplifying how conducive the area is not
only for college kids, but for family life as
well. Ann Arbor also has not only one movie
theater, but two! Granted, some of the mov-
ies they play come out 5 months later than
when they actually debut ... but hey, who's
counting?
The farmer's market is another con-
venient aspect of the city. Locally grown
foods are cheaper and healthier for us
humans, and they also decrease pollution
and cut costs for imported goods from
other countries. Being in Ann Arbor taught
me all of that - admittedly, it also brought
out the inner tree hugger in me.
Aside from the amazing sights, it's the
people of Ann Arbor, like the woman at
Biggby, who make this city what it is.
There's a certain energy you can feel when
you walk down the streets of downtown.
Even the homeless men asking for money
on the street are friendly. "You have a
blessed day now," they say, even when you
can't spare some change. The city is a per-
fect example for the world to model after.
So what does the world have to do to be
like Ann Arbor? It's a simple recipe really.
It requires a dash of compassion, a pinch of
exercise, a sprinkle of humor, a tablespoon
of education and a variety of languages and
cultures all blended together. Bada bing
bada boom, and there you have it, the per-
fect recipe and most importantly, the world
is saved.

album were relatively disappoint-

which he debuted live for the first

way. "Retrograde," the crown-

unexpectedly flat. The song's
cathartic crescendo of synths
didn't pack the awe-inspiring
punch of the studio track, and for
the first time that night, Blake's
vocals didn't quite "hit" right.
After an encore performance
of his Joni Mitchell cover, "A

rousing applause and looked gen-

response as he left the stage.
At one point in the show, Blake
remarked that the Majestic The-

cians as a "magical" venue and
that he could certainly see why.
Though his genre of music is
not inherently thrilling live -
glass bottles were daintily sipped
that night rather than thrown on
stage - and though he and his
band missed the mark on a few
tracks in Detroit, James Blake
has incredible talent, and his live
performance (which matched the
Majestic's dark and gloomy atmo-
sphere) is certainly one worth
seeing.

bers the alien attack on New York
City. Tony, more than anyone, has
questions about that day, but none
more pressing than, "Are we safe
now?" Having established a solid
relationship with Pepper Potts
(Gwyneth Paltrow, "Contagion"),
Tony has everything to lose and
spends sleepless nights preoccu-
pying his tireless brain.
Then enters the Mandarin,
played by Ben Kingsly ("The Dic-
tator") and bearing resemblance
to Osama bin Laden. By the time
the film starts, the Mandarin has
already attacked three Ameri-
can cities and promises more to
come. Between the terrorism and
Tony's obvious PTSD symptoms,
a very serious tone pervades the
film.
But director Shane Black ("Kiss
Kiss Bang Bang") makes an inter-
esting move: He keeps it comical.
The film is interspersed with jokes,
ironies and deadpan sarcasm that
keeps it engaging even when the
plot simmers down. And it does sim-
mer down, albeit in a good way.
About an hour in, the focus
shifts to Tony's encounters with a
fatherless boy who possesses the
same genius and sense of humor as
his own. Here the audience views
a vulnerable Tony - vulnerable
because his suit is damaged and
unusable, and vulnerable because
the boy forces him to confront
his own past demons. But just
when sappiness threatens to over-
whelm, the film switches back to

comedy, then back to action. It's
not perfect - in fact, it's rather
abrupt - but it works.
And it works because Robert
Downey Jr. is Tony Stark. This is
a character we have seen through
four films and, at this point, one that
carries a set of expectations. We
expect the cynicism, the sarcasm,
the over-the-top action, but also the
heart and heroics of a man with a
dark past thatstill wants to do right.
Stark and Rhodey (Don Cheadle,
"Flight") - formerly War Machine
and now the Iron Patriot - domi-
nate the action sequences, though
even Paltrow has more than one
shining moment. The obligatory
final battle scene may not hold up
to that of "The Avengers," and the
road there is somewhat bumpy, but
it holds its own and truly thrills.
Kingsley and Guy Pearce ("Pro-
metheus") clearly enjoy playing the
villains, with Kingsley particularly
standing out. There's no real way to
go into it without spoiling the best
twist of a multi-twist film, but, to
put it as the Mandarin so eloquently
does: You'll never see it coming.
At this point,
Downey Jr. is
Tony Stark.
Black makes this entry memo-
rable because, while there are quite
a few action sequences, the bulk of
the film is spent with its heroes out-
side of their armor. He reminds us
that, in the end, Tony is just a man.
He has a life beyond the suit and
must face consequences of actions
he took long before he became Iron
Man.
Beneath its action-packed exte-
rior, "Iron Man 3" has heart. It has
a story to tell, and a good story at
that. It certainly has its noticeable
faults, but a chance to see Downey
Jr. in that hot-rod red and gold
chrome is always a chance worth
taking.
Stay after the credits for some
comic interplay between Tony and
an old friend.
