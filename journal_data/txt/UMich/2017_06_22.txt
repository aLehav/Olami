Full tuition guaranteed to 
in-state students in need

University Regents 
affirm committment 

to low-income 

Michigan families 

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily News Editor

University of Michigan alum 

Lehman Robinson applied to his 
now alma mater on a whim. As a 
first-generation 
college 
student 

coming 
from 
a 
low-income 

household, he assumed the school 
would be out of his family’s means 
— until he received his financial aid 
notice. Six years later, he said he’s 
still grateful for his aid package, 
which covered much of his tuition. 
Still, he had no idea what was in 
store when he applied.

Robinson would now be covered 

by the University’s new Go Blue 
Guarantee: a commitment to free 
tuition for in-state undergraduate 
students on the Ann Arbor campus 
with family incomes under $65,000. 
Set to go into effect in January 2018, 

the announcement was publicly 
revealed at the Board of Regents 
meeting June 15. Even though the 
3,000 students currently on campus 
under that financial threshold 
already typically receive full aid, 
the guarantee succeeded in making 
national headlines as a model of 
affordable higher education.

University officials’ comments 

last week centered around breaking 
down perceptions of the University 
as cost prohibitive.

“I think about the seventh grader 

in Ypsilanti or Detroit or Grand 
Rapids whose mom or dad can say 
to them, ‘Work hard. Do well in 
school. You can go to the University 
of Michigan,’ ” University President 
Mark Schlissel said Thursday. 
“There are a lot of folks now that 
can’t really say that because they 
don’t know if they can afford it.” 

Will the University’s bet — that 

a public, visible commitment to 
financial aid will boost low-income 
students’ application rates — pay 
off?

Kedra Ishop, vice provost for 

enrollment 
management, 
said 

the 
University’s 
preliminary 

analysis indicates such signaling 
messages can be that powerful. 
Much of the University’s impetus 
for the guarantee came from the 
two-year-old 
HAIL 
Scholars 

program, an initiative offering 
“high-achieving, 
low-income 

students” with four years of free 
tuition. Last fall, 262 freshmen 
arrived on campus after being 
directly pursued through HAIL; 
select high schools in low-income 
target areas received application 
waivers, communication to parents 
and school advisers and packages 
complete with a note from Schlissel. 

Though final results have yet to 

be released, Ishop said early HAIL 
analyses were enough to convince 
administrators of the guarantee, 
with application rates at target 
schools rising by as much as 43 
percent.

“That was almost a two-and-

a-half-fold increase,” Ishop said. 
“We’re taking what HAIL taught 
us, and going public with a version 
of that specific commitment.”

HAIL draws from national 

studies 
like 
that 
of 
Stanford

Planned Parenthood 
supporters emphasize 

impact of bill on 
women’s health

By ANDREW HIYAMA
Summer Daily News Editor

Over 100 Ann Arbor residents 

and 
Planned 
Parenthood 

supporters rallied at the Michigan 
Union Wednesday night to march 
in opposition of the Republican 
health care bill quickly and quietly 
making its way through the Senate, 
as well as the proposed federal 
defunding of Planned Parenthood.

The 
bill 
has 
received 

widespread 
criticism 
for 
its 

lack of transparency. Though 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch 
McConnell (R–Kentucky) said a 
draft of the bill will be released 
Thursday — one week before it 
is expected to come to a vote — 
so far it has only been seen by a 
handful of Republican senators. 
The version of the bill passed by 
the House of Representatives in 
May is expected to increase the 
number of uninsured Americans 
by 23 million, according to the 
Congressional Budget Office.

Speaking to the crowd ahead 

of the march, Lauren Bacans, the 
Mid Michigan Field Organizer for 
Planned Parenthood, emphasized 
the disproportionate impact of 
the Republican’s proposed health 
care plan on women.

“Everything is on the line for 

the 2.4 million patients that rely 
on Planned Parenthood services 
annually and whose healthcare 
is on the chopping block as

Increasing affordable housing options 
remains top concern for students, city

In 2016, 599 students 
listed an Ypsilanti 
zip code as their home 
or permanent address

By KAELA THEUT

Summer Daily News Editor

Rather than merely walking 

across the Diag to get to class, 
Music, Theatre & Dance senior 
Mackenzie Larrance’s morning 
routine consists of fighting traffic 
during her daily commute across 
town from her Ypsilanti residence.

Her reasoning behind renting 

an apartment so far from central 
campus? The rapidly rising cost of 
living for both students and Ann 
Arbor residents.

“I decided to live outside of 

Ann Arbor for two reasons: I had 
a car, and it was less expensive,” 
Larrance said. “I’m also in a 
serious relationship where my 
boyfriend and I have been dating 
for almost 5 years. He and I can’t 
afford an apartment in downtown 
Ann Arbor without getting a full 
time job. It’s also difficult finding 
other couples like ourselves who 

would want to split the costs of 
living.”

Larrance further noted her 

expenses for living in Ypsilanti 
are almost a thousand dollars 
cheaper than if she were to rent an 
apartment in Ann Arbor.

“I’d say on average, I pay 

approximately $1,400 a month 
when living in Ypsilanti,” she 
said. “This includes rent, food, 
gas and other college expenses. 
For a single room apartment in 
Ann Arbor, that’s about $1,200 
which is $400 more than my 
apartment in Ypsilanti. Then 
once you add my other expenses, 
I would be paying $2,200 a 
month. I took out gas in that 
calculation too.”

According to the U.S. Census 

Bureau, the median rate for rent 
in Ann Arbor has increased 14 
percent from 2010 to 2015 and 
now sits at approximately $1,075 
per month — despite the amount 
of high-density housing areas 
also rising by 32 percent. It is 
important to note this number 
accounts for the entire city, so it 
may not reflect the experiences 
of students living in areas such 
as Kerrytown or South Campus.

However, 
rent 
prices 
are 

high enough that in 2016, 599 
students, 
such 
as 
Larrance, 

listed an Ypsilanti zip code as 
either their permanent or local 
address — a number troubling to 
urban planners.

A 2015 study, commissioned 

by the Washtenaw County Office 
of Community and Economic 
Development and prepared by czb 
L.L.C., a Virginia-based urban 
planning 
and 
neighborhood 

development 
consulting 
firm, 

stated the increasing economic 
inequality between the two cities 
will negatively affect the county.

Unless policies are changed, 

the report states Ann Arbor 
will only continue to become 
more expensive, while Ypsilanti 
property values will plummet due 
to high turnover rate.

“The result will be a county 

decreasingly 
affordable 
and 

out of balance and, eventually, 
unsustainable, as some parts 
of the county possibly degrade 
beyond a point of no return, 
and 
others 
grow 
in 
value 

beyond a point that’s ever again 
affordable,” the report reads. 
“The 
imbalance 
in 
income, 

education 
and 
opportunity 

between 
the 
jurisdictions, 

along with the socioeconomic 
segregation that goes with it, will 
hamper the regional economic 
growth potential of the area.”

As a result of this report, in 

2015, Ann Arbor City Council 
members voted 10-1 to adopt 
affordable housing goals such 
as creating nearly 2,800 new 

affordably priced rental units by 
2035. They also hope to augment 
demand for housing in Ypsilanti 
by 4,187 units through measures 
such 
as 
increasing 
energy 

efficiency 
and 
tearing 
down 

vacant buildings.

In 
a 
Central 
Student 

Government 
2016 
fall 
panel, 

Councilmember 
Zachary 

Ackerman (D–Ward 3), who is 
a recent University graduate, 
and then-County Commissioner 
Yousef Rabhi, who is now an 
Ann Arbor state representative, 
expressed concern that increased 
housing costs would continue to 
lower socioeconomic diversity 
within Ann Arbor as students 
move elsewhere in search of 
cheaper rent.

“(Ann Arbor’s) diversity is 

slowly escaping us,” Rabhi said. 
“If we don’t work hard and make 
sure we have our full options on 
where to live, not only will our 
student body become less diverse, 
our community will become less 
diverse.”

Yet, despite the commitment 

by city officials to work towards 
increasing housing diversity in 
Washtenaw County, the issue 
remains at the forefront of the 
minds of both University students 
and city residents — especially in 
regards to the influx of luxury 
housing being constructed in 
downtown Ann Arbor.

City Council affirms dedication to Paris Accords and 
voter registration, urges importance of reduced emissions

Westphal noted true 
compliance with the 
agreement requires 
more than passage 
of the resolution

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Summer Daily News Editor

Ann Arbor City Council con-

vened for another biweekly meet-
ing Monday night, passing an 
ordinance making it easier for resi-
dents to register to vote as well as 
a resolution committing the city 
to the goals of the Paris Climate 
Accords.

The ordinance, sponsored by 

Councilmembers Zachary Acker-
man (D–Ward 3) and Chip Smith 

(D–Ward 5), as well as Mayor Chris 
Taylor, amended the City’s hous-
ing code to require all landlords 
to provide tenants with a booklet 
“explaining the rights of tenants 
under city and state law” at the 
beginning of their leases, accord-
ing to the text of the ordinance.

“No owner of rental property 

located in Ann Arbor or agent of 
such an owner shall lease or con-
tract to lease such property with-
out furnishing to the tenant, before 
the time of leasing or contracting, 
a copy of said booklet,” the ordi-
nance reads.

Ackerman noted the ordinance 

would affect the majority of the 
city’s residents.

“This ordinance would mandate 

that landlords, at the beginning of 
leases, provide voter registration 
forms to their new tenants,” he 
said. “This will help keep our voter 

rolls updated, but also in a time 
when voter access is being threat-
ened in this state, will make access 
to the polls a lot easier for the 58 
percent of residents in this city 
who rent their housing.”

Councilmember Kirk Westphal 

(D–Ward 2) said though the idea 
had already been pitched in years 
past, it was the initiative of the 
sponsors that brought it to finally 
pass.

“I just want to thank the spon-

sors for pushing this forward,” he 
said. “An initiative like this has 
been mentioned on and off for 
years, but as always, it takes leader-
ship to pick up the flag and carry it 
across the finish line, so I’m really 
happy that this is coming to a sec-
ond reading.”

The initiative passed unani-

mously with nine votes in favor, 
as Councilmembers Jason Frenzel 

 
 
 
 
 MAX KUANG/DAILY 

West Bloomfield resident Judith Mihalko-Mueller and Michigan United organizer 
Melissa Bruzzano march together in the Planned Parenthood March on the Diag 
on Wednesday. 

(D–Ward 1) and Graydon Krapohl 
(D–Ward 4) were absent from the 
meeting. The ordinance will go into 
effect August 1.

Ann Arbor also added itself to a 

growing list of municipalities, states 
and corporations that have com-
mitted themselves to upholding the 
Paris Climate Accord following Pres-
ident Donald Trump’s decision to 
withdraw the United States from the 
agreement. The agreement’s main 
goal is to hold the average global 
temperature to less than 2º C above 
the average temperature prior to the 
Industrial Revolution.

Smith said the commitment of 

smaller jurisdictions to the agree-
ment was more important than the 
commitment of the White House.

“One of the most important things 

to come out of the Paris climate 
agreements is the realization that 
cities globally play the biggest role 

in reducing carbon emissions,” he 
said. “Just because the administra-
tion in Washington is not interested 
in meeting the goals set forth in Paris 
does not mean the city of Ann Arbor 
is interested in also shirking our 
responsibility.”

Westphal noted true compliance 

with the agreement would require 
more than the passage of the resolu-
tion.

“For us to really move the needle, 

it’s abundantly clear we have to radi-
cally rethink the things that we do 
have control over if we want to stay 
consistent with the Paris agreement 
when it comes to emissions per capi-
ta,” he said. “A couple I can think of: 
housing supply near jobs, heavy rail 
transit, rules that mandate parking 
spaces. So in short, we’ve got plenty 
of resolutions on the books, but we’ll 
see if we have the resolve to make it 
work.”

Economics Prof. Caroline Hoxby, 
who found in 2013 a “vast majority 
of low-income, high achievers do 
not apply to any selective college” 
— even though less competitive 
schools might mean higher out-of-
pocket costs.

“Telling students we’ll meet 

all demonstrated need … that 
language can get complicated,” 
Ishop said. “This signals the 
element of achievement and 
aspiration — if a student wants 
a high-quality institution like 
ours, they have to aspire and 
work hard. But by taking cost off 
the table, that allows them to be 
in the space of achievement and 
aspiration a little bit differently 
than if they just decide they can’t 
pay for it anyway.”

Robinson spent a year in the 

Michigan 
College 
Advising 

Corps mentoring students in that 
space, often working to persuade 
first-generation and low-income 
students they were qualified 
enough to apply to schools like 
the University. 

“These kids, they just don’t 

know from the outside looking 
in,” he said. “When I went back 
to my own high school to advise, 
there were all these notions of 

me being stuck-up or that they 
could never get there. Even 
though they had the scores and 
GPA, it’s a matter of access. They 
just don’t know this information 
— and neither did I.”

Misperceptions of financial 

aid can often swing the other 
way, with many assuming free 
tuition for some students means 
more cost for others. That tuition 
rates for the 2017-18 school year 
increased by 2.9 percent for 
in-state students and 4.5 percent 
for out-of-state students didn’t 
help. Last week, the Detroit 
News published an editorial 
titled “Free not always a great 
deal,” blasting the University 
for offering the guarantee at 
the 
expense 
of 
middle-class 

students. The editorial cites 
Regent Andrea Fischer Newman 
(R), who voted against the tuition 
hikes June 15 and said middle-
class families would be “priced 
out of the opportunity for the 
world-class education available 
at the University of Michigan.”

Schlissel fired back with a 

letter to the editor Wednesday, 
arguing the University has really 
“made 
college 
achievement 

easier 
for 
this 
critical 
and 

financially challenged segment 
of the population.”

part of Trumpcare,” she said. 
“Trumpcare is the worst bill for 
women’s health in a generation, 
and it must be stopped now.”

Ann Arbor Mayor Chris Taylor 

noted while the Republican’s 
health care bill often carries 
President Donald Trump’s name, 
it was the responsibility of the 
party as a whole.

“When 
we 
woke 
up 
on 

November 
9, 
we 
anticipated 

the dishonor that our nation 
would endure, having elected 
and entrusted our country to 
a people and a party as cruel 
and as reckless as the ones we 
have now in Washington,” he 
said. “But I think few among us 
really imagined the breadth and 
heartlessness of the assault on 
science, on poverty, on climate, on 
immigrants, on refugees and the 
disfranchised, and now, of course, 
the final insult that brings us here 
today: the assault of this president 
and this party on women and 
health care.”

Continuing, 
Taylor 
said 
it 

wasn’t for lack of capacity the 
United 
States 
had 
so 
many 

uninsured people.

OPINION

T

he 
founders 
of 
the 

United States created our 
country on many guiding 

principles, the first being freedom 
of speech and the press. Despite it 
being a value settled centuries ago, 
it is a concept that contemporary 
society still grapples with today. 
Specifically, the limits of free 
speech 
are 
contested 
when 

discussing 
mainstream 
media, 

speakers on university campuses, 
and 
words 
considered 
hate 

speech. 

I argue that those with political 

or capital power tend to reap the 
benefits of free speech more so than 
oppressed groups. This is evident 
when evaluating state legislations 
punishing students who protest 
speakers and prominent media 
figures 
saying 
controversial 

phrases.

The Michigan Daily Editorial 

Board recently highlighted two 
Michigan bills that give public 
institutions the power to disrupt 
peaceful 
assembly 
given 
the 

correct circumstances and punish 
students for participating in these 
assemblies. State senators produced 
these bills because of the many 
instances of students preventing 
controversial speakers from doing 
events on campus. The bills look 
to preserve free speech; however, 
by doing so they restrict peaceful 
assembly and protest, another 
avenue of free speech.

The 
instances 
that 
have 

sparked this argument are mainly 
those such as events with Milo 
Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter at 
Berkeley. These events ended with 
violence and fear at the university, 
an outcome most people agree 
should be avoided. Personally, 
I don’t feel that violence is the 
answer to fighting these ideas. 

On 
the 
other 
hand, 
many 

protesters were not those who 
simply disagreed with Milo or 

Coulter’s political stances, but 
rather 
felt 
similarly 
attacked 

and unsafe by their messages. 
Yiannopoulos has a history of 
prejudice, whether it be from 
his racially-motivated attacks on 
Leslie Jones, or his denunciation 
of a transgender student. For 
these 
reasons, 
students 
often 

feel threatened by prejudice and 
bigotry being preached on their 
own campus. Therefore, I very 
well could be privileged not to feel 
compelled to violence, as it could 
feel like self-defense. Of course I 
don’t condone violence, but I have 
not had to endure the conditions 
that make violence seem necessary.

Violence has obviously been the 

catalyst behind these bill, as it not 
only looks to improve free speech, 
but also safety. But a byproduct of 
the bills is restricting the free speech 
of the ones who feel threatened the 
most. Ultimately, it protects the 
powerful speakers who already have 
political capital, and dismisses and 
punishes the oppressed who stand to 
lose the most. 

This also stands true when 

evaluating how uses of “free speech” 
are 
treated 
among 
celebrities, 

notably Bill Maher and Kathy 
Griffin. Recently, both comedians 
sparked controversy by pushing the 
boundaries of acceptable free speech. 
Bill Maher referred to himself as a 
“house n*****” in a slavery joke on 
his show Real Time With Bill Maher. 
Kathy Griffin posted a photo with a 
violently decapitated Trump head. 

While both were distasteful 

jokes, society criticized Kathy 
much more vehemently than they 
did Maher. In fact, in the YouTube 
video in which Bill discusses 
the incident with Ice Cube and 
Symone Sanders, the comments 
are filled with praise for Maher and 
hatred for Sanders and Ice Cube’s 
criticisms. 

After Sanders notes that the 

history of house slaves is not only 
black but primarily female, one 
commenter goes as far to say, 
“Symone Sanders is a disgusting 
racist who is in no position 
to 
lecture 
others 
on 
racism. 

Hypocritical, disgusting, racist, 
horrible person.” This comment 
has seventy-seven likes.

The video itself also has four 

thousand more dislikes than likes. 
While I grant that Ice Cube is far 
from the posterchild for prejudice-
free America, the video speaks to 
the pass that Maher gets because 
of his political capital. Not only is 
he free from criticism, those who 
object to his use are condemned.

On the other hand, CNN fired 

Kathy Griffin and many claim 
her career to be over. While she 
did make a very insensitive joke 
toward a sitting president, it 
sparked a much fiercer blowback 
that Maher’s incident did. Both in 
the name of comedy, although only 
Maher is free from criticism. I love 
Bill Maher and watch him weekly, 
but it clear that he is benefitting 
from privilege that grants him more 
free speech power. And although 
Griffin is a powerful woman, she is 
a woman nonetheless and has been 
afforded far less room to push the 
societal boundaries of free speech

The 
free 
speech 
incidents 

surrounding university campuses 
and comedians have showcased 
how 
the 
free 
swpeech 
of 

disenfranchised groups in America 
are put behind others. There 
can be arguments over which 
jokes are tasteful, or what form 
of protest is appropriate, but we 
shouldn’t punish those already at 
a disadvantage in society. If you 
value free speech and its principles, 
value everyone’s free speech.

reserving 
and 
marking 

the sites of ancient Native 
American burial mounds, 

which are prevalent in the Midwest 
where ancient tribes such as the 
Adena lived until 1 A.D, is crucial 
for acknowledging the depth of the 
scars colonialism has left on our 
society. However, a simple marker or 
plaque beside a mound can only do 
so much — a deeper understanding 
of different indigenous cultures is 
needed if we are to truly empathize 
with and respect people who lived 
here before Europeans laid their first 
camps.

Imagine this situation: an Adena 

mound is located on the construction 
site of an office complex. The 
contractor has bought all the supplies, 
has 
promised 
their 
employees 

work and has promised their client 
an office building. Construction 
commences, and in the process of 
digging out the basement someone 
finds a skull. Federal law requires the 
contractor to call law enforcement 
and establish a crime scene. Then a 
coroner works with ethnoforensics 
specialists to excavate, halting the 
project for, say, a year. 

By the time they finish, the 

contractor has to pay his builders 
for the work they were shorted and 
is eager to speed along the building 
process so the client doesn’t hire 
somebody else for their next job. 
Ethnoforensics say some remains — 
some tools, an arm or a leg — might 
still be there, but they extracted what 
they could to comply with the law in 
a timely manner.

The land on which the mound 

once sat is then partially covered 
with an office building, and the other 
portion has been flattened to create a 
clean-cut lawn. The remains found 
in the mound are safe inside a local 
historical society, guarded by the 
meticulous hands of conservation 
specialists 
in 
a 
temperature-

controlled room, but the land from 
whence it came bears no mark of the 
objects ever being there. And nothing 
marks the site that was once a sacred 
tomb.

Something kind of similar (kind 

of) happened in 2012 with Richard 
III of England, whose remains were 
found under a church parking lot. 
I don’t think construction workers 
knew what they were building on 
when they were laying pavement, but 
the fiasco became a media sensation, 
and now there are memes about it.

It’s funny when the thing being 

defiled is perceived by the dominant 
culture as larger than life — has the 
privilege of, well, royalty.

It’s not so funny when the people 

whose legacy is being defiled are 
the ancestors of a demographic 
that has been, and continues to 
be, consistently undervalued and 
mistreated by dominant American 
culture. So, what should we do about 
it?

One option is a plaque. A memorial. 

More extensive museums. But, 
surprise, it’s not that simple. 

When I visited Shrum Mound, I 

could obviously see it, but I couldn’t 
feel the depth of its meaning in my 
own bones the way I could in St. 
Paul’s Cathedral. I needed a better 
translation of Adena culture than 
what the plaque could give me. 
Because of this, my visit to Shrum 
Mound in some ways felt trivial. I 
saw a giant bulge in the earth, but I 
didn’t know quite what to make of it. 
It’s impossible to connect with these 
ancient communities when there 
are no markers, but even when there 
are markers, I can’t glean as much 
as I need from them to feel any such 
connection.

What I know I share with the 

Adena people is the land. Without 
conflating 
indigenous 
people 

and “nature,” which can be a 
dehumanizing and dangerous thing 
to do, I’ve been trying to learn more 
about the landscape I’ve dwelled 
upon all my life, as I know it offered 
powerful 
resources 
to 
ancient 

communities who hunted, gathered 
and farmed on it. My new field guide 
about wildflowers in Ohio will give 
me a Westernized, classification-
focused 
education. 
Though 
I 

can’t say for sure, it’s likely a much 
different understanding of local flora 
than what the Adena had. Still, it’s a 
start.

Flipping through its sturdy pages, 

I take note of which are native and 
which were introduced from abroad 
(mostly Europe), as those are the 
plants the Adena most likely used. I 
learned the Oswego people used the 
red-flowered plant Monarda didyma, 
a type of mint, for tea (the plant is 
now colloquially called Oswego Tea). 
Though I’m not familiar with its red 
flowers, I see the light purple blooms 
of its relative, Monarda fistulosa, 
everywhere around here. That plant, 
colloquially named Wild Bergamot, 
has been cultivated for European 
commercial teas. I haven’t yet 
made the tea, but I hope to try it 
soon and taste what the Adena 
might have.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I

f you know me, then you 
know there are about four 
things I need to survive in 

life: Drake, Lush Cosmetics, 
Buffalo Wild Wings’ chicken 
wings 
and 
basketball. 
I 

can remember one of my 
first birthday gifts being a 
basketball and creating an 
entire imaginary team I would 
play against in tournaments. 
As the years passed, I started 
collecting 
NBA 
jerseys, 

starting with Michael Jordan, 
then after that Allen Iverson, 
LeBron James, Derrick Rose 
and Rajon Rondo. After my 
fir st honor roll report card 
in 
elementary 
school, 
my 

dad bought my first hoop, 
and I spent hours outside 
practicing my shot. Though 
I am only 5’4’’ on a good day, 
I was able to join both my 
middle school and high school 
teams, serving as a member of 
the starting lineup and was a 
captain for both teams.

I have always been a fan 

of the NBA and WNBA. I 
remember asking my mother 
to 
purchase 
extra 
sports 

channels from DirecTV so 
that I, a Chicago native, could 
watch the Boston Celtics, my 
favorite team, play. Some of 
the best memories I have from 
my childhood include going to 
the United Center and seeing 
the Chicago Bulls play. Sitting 
at the game, I was able to feel 
the excitement and energy of 
the crowd, the passion of the 
players and the overall love 
for the game which makes 
any sporting event a blast to 
attend — as I am sure anyone 
who has been to the Big House 
on gameday can attest to. I am 
excited to tell my children that 
I was able to witness Derrick 
Rose’s campaign to winning 
the 
2010-2011 
NBA 
MVP, 

along with the rise of LeBron 
James — the 2nd greatest 
basketball player of all time, 
the awe of Stephen Curry and 
the 
seemingly 
unstoppable 

Golden State Warriors or even 
the farewell tour of one of the 
greatest players the game has 
ever seen, Kobe Bryant. I have 
seen so much in relation to 
this sport, yet when it comes 
to women in it, I have seen so 
little.

Just a few weeks ago, my 

boyfriend sent me a text 
which said, “If I were a girl 

it would suck creating a 
MyCareer because I couldn’t 
design a player to reflect my 
own identity.” As a recent 
Playstation 4 owner, he had 
been tinkering around with 
the different features on the 
game “NBA 2k17.” One of 
these features was the widely 
popular “MyCareer” where the 
gamer creates a customizable 
player and develops a story/
career in the NBA through 
gameplay. Knowing that I 
too play “2k12,” he shared 
his thoughts regarding the 
lack of diversity within the 
game, which inspired me to 
write this piece. Though he 
is a writer for male sports 
and, as I put it, a “know-it-
all,” I was impressed with 

his 
refreshing 
reflections, 

as 
he 
usually 
does 
not 

consider female perspectives 
regarding 
professional 

athletics. 
His 
text 
was 

referring to the fact that each 
of the NBA 2k games which 
have been released to date 
with the “MyCareer” feature 
lack the ability to customize 
and develop the career for 
a female basketball player. 
Instead, the game limits the 
gamer to customizing from 
default 
settings 
a 
man’s 

identity/persona, 
and 
then 

pursuing his dive into the 
professional basketball world. 
You would think, “Of course 
there isn’t an option to design 
a woman on ‘NBA 2k’ because 
it reflects the likeness of the 
NBA, which does not include 
women athletes.” This is a 
reasonable 
argument, 
one 

which could be easily settled 
if there were a “WNBA 2k” 
game to reference. However, 
there is a complete lack of any 
WNBA related video games.

I can reflect upon the 

days my cousin and I would 
battle it out on the game 

“NBA Street Vol. 2” using the 
original Xbox console. As a 
young girl admiring the sport 
and the fun of the games, 
related toys and other fan 
paraphernalia, the fact that 
women were left completely 
underrepresented in regards 
to it all went completely over 
my head. Now, in my older 
age, as I sit with my younger 
sister, who is also a basketball 
player 
and 
complete 
our 

career on “NBA 2k” as men 
or lace up our Kyrie Irving 
basketball 
shoes 
designed 

and marketed for men, I 
wonder, “What happened?” 
These inequalities don’t just 
exist in video games, or in the 
basketball world, it reflects 
real life. In real life, women 
experience 
unequal 
pay 

and restricted reproductive 
rights, access to health care 
and 
education, 
and 
many 

women around the world are 
subjected to violence without 
ever receiving justice.

These issues contribute to 

gender inequality and plague 
our world and women every 
second. It isn’t virtual. It 
isn’t a game. It is damaging, 
discriminatory and a threat 
to women everywhere. We are 
targeted. We are exploited. 
We 
are 
unprotected 
and 

underrepresented, and one 
of the worst aspects of it 
all is that we are told this is 
how it is supposed to be. We 
are told that we should be 
subservient. We are told we 
should be inferior. We are told 
that we cannot and will not 
ever be equal to men. It starts 
with relatively small things 
like video games or sports, 
then 
it 
slowly 
infiltrates 

the 
infrastructure 
of 
our 

everyday lives. Therefore, it is 
crucial that we pay attention 
and open our eyes to both 
overt and covert messages. 
Awareness is the catalyst to 
both problem solving and 
change.

Are your eyes open?

W

e, the new generation 
of Wolverines. We, the 
Victors and the Valiant. 

We, the Leaders and Best. We, 
make up a group of students of all 
colors, 
backgrounds, 
economic 

positions, religions and sexual 
orientations. Including graduate, 
professional and undergraduate 
students, there is roughly 45,000 of 
us. Most of us spend four years or 
more at the University of Michigan 
before we go on to our destined 
careers. During our time here, 
we face challenges that are often 
unique to the college experience, 
and unique to us as individuals. 
Amid the challenges we all face, we 
as students have responsibility to 
look out for our fellow Wolverines 
and offer a helping hand. 

Being a student in college is 

a difficulty in itself; however, 
minorities experience all kinds of 
challenges unique to them. These 
include building communities, facing 
a new culture, financial difficulties 
and 
sometimes 
discrimination. 

Today, 44 percent of college students 
in America have at one time reported 
feeling symptoms of depression. 
Depression is high among college 
students, and the statistics are even 
higher among minorities. According 
to the National Institute of Mental 
Health, 
African-Americans 
and 

Mexican-American students face the 
greatest barriers to receive mental 
health treatment. As it stands right 
now, 17 percent of students at the 
University come from low-income 
families. About 5 percent of students 
are first-generation students. As of 
the fall of 2015, 14 percent of students 
at the University are nonresident 
aliens, according to the Office of the 
Register. In fact, about 5 percent 
of students on campus are African 
American, and about 5 percent 
are Hispanic. Though there is not 
an exact statistic for the number 
of LGBTQ students on campus, 
LGBTQ-identifying people make up 
about 4 percent of the population in 
the state of Michigan. These statistics 
tells us who the minorities we see 
and talk to on campus every day are.

More often than not, first-

generation students are initially 
on their own when it comes to 
figuring out the ins and outs of 
college. Navigating the financial 
burdens, choosing a major and 
understanding study techniques 
are 
examples 
of 
practical 

knowledge that first-generation 
students are not simply handed 
down by their parents. Non-

resident aliens face a new world 
away from home without the 
benefits that U.S. citizen-students 
can take for granted. The current 
political scene makes that clear 
enough. Students from low-income 
families at times experience their 
uniqueness on campus by being 
unable to afford the daily comforts 
that other students never question. 
In the past year, African-American 
students have felt the spite and 
hatred of racism through obscene 
flyers 
postedaround 
central 

campus. As a lesbian student 
myself, I have come to understand 
the “wear and tear” of finding 
my way on such a large campus, 
especially relating to my sexual 
orientation. 
The 
characteristic 

that make individuals “minorities” 
are usually sensitive topics and 
hard to address until a level of 
comfortability is found with others, 
and this takes time. I have only 
mentioned a few challenges; yet, as 
students, we all face obstacles that 
are unique to us.

The University has done an 

extraordinary 
job 
of 
making 

the campus a welcoming place 
no matter who you are. At only 
a 5 percent dropout rate, the 
University has proven that they 
will be there for its students. While 
the University can always do more, 
we as students can always improve 
as we come to the aid of our 
brothers and sisters on campus. We 
must help each other by offering 
our hand when we observe the 
challenges that our fellow students 
are facing. Many times, we read 
these kinds of prompts and feel 
overwhelmed, as though we as 
individuals are responsible to 
make change in people’s lives. 
What we should understand is 
that change takes teamwork. The 
answer is simpler. We can make a 
difference in the lives of whoever is 
around us at that moment, such as 
looking out for our friends who we 
know are short on money. Coming 
alongside a new transfer student 
on campus and showing them 
around. Taking our roommates 
to a campus medical service if 
needed. Standing up for each 
other. Sure, this is a competitive 
university, but what makes us the 
“Leaders and the Best” is taking 
initiative to understand what our 
peers are going through, and being 
each other’s support.

‘Crack-Up’ is expansive

By SEAN LANG

Daily Arts Writer

Might as well add Crack-Up to the 

list of albums whose singles spoil 
their opening tracks. The album, 
an epic across space and time, is the 
first by Fleet Foxes in six years after 
“artistic differences” led to some 
form of break-up after 2011’s Help-
lessness Blues. Crack-Up begins with 
the whisper of “I Am All That I Need 
/ Arroyo Seco / Thumbprint Scar,” 
but explodes one minute into the 
track as “The band kicks the loner 
off the stage” — according to the 
liner notes, which are interspersed 
through songs, drawing a narrative 
out of the album. Had we not been 
exposed to “Third of May / daiga-
hara,” “Fool’s Errand” or “If You 
Need To, Keep Time On Me,” this 
explosion would have carried all the 
weight in the world as the beloved 
folk rock band from Seattle transi-
tioned from indefinite silence to a 
grandeur even greater in scale than 
their first two efforts.

Between Helplessness Blues and 

Crack-Up, vocalist Robin Pecknold 
— also the driving creative force of 
the project — enrolled in literature 
courses at Columbia University in 
2012, a decision he has cited as hav-
ing a serious effect on not just his 
music, but his life. His venture into 
academia is evident on the surface 
level with references to Beowulf 
— “Mearcstapa” is named for the 
legend’s antagonist, Grendel — and 
Julius Caesar — both in “Cassius” 
and “I Should See Memphis.”

The album name itself, Crack-

Up, comes from an essay by F. Scott 
Fitzgerald of the same name, wide-
ly quoted for his idea that one of 
the greatest marks of intelligence 
is the ability to engage with and 

understand both sides of an argu-
ment and still function. It’s hard to 
tell exactly how this plays into the 
album’s themes, and some may write 
the album off as a slew of semi-pre-
tentious name-drops, but there is 
a sense of duality to the album: the 
city versus the ocean, the individual 
versus the collective, January versus 
June, and the homophones “wide/
white” and “heedless/heatless” on 
“Keep Time On Me.”

Still, literary references can’t in 

and of themselves give a truly cre-
ative sense of greater meaning to a 
new work. Rest assured, Pecknold 
reaches inward just as often as he 
does outward. The album’s first 
single “Third of May / daigahara” is 
serious self-reflection through time, 
ultimately a triumphant yet melan-
cholic ode to the passage of time and 
the loneliness that can come with 
it. Twice on the song he asks “Was 
I too slow?” The first time, he then 
asks “Did you change overnight?” 
The second time, “Did I change over-
night?” Pecknold might be looking 
for someone to blame, but he seems 
to realize it may be himself.

The song is also startlingly inter-

woven in the band’s history. Help-
lessness Blues was released on May 
third, so when Pecknold sings “It 
all fell in line on the third of May / 
As if it were designed / Painted in 
sand to be washed away,” it feels like 
he is acknowledging that the band 
couldn’t have lasted, or at least not 
then. May third is also the birthday 
of Pecknold’s close friend and band-
mate Skyler Skjelset, and the line 
about congregating at “the firing 
line” is a reference to a painting also 
named Third of May by Francisco 
Goya — perhaps further evidence of 
his return to school or, more likely, a 
happy coincidence that he stumbled 

upon the painting outside of his for-
mal studies.

While enrolled at Columbia, Pec-

knold also took up surfing according 
to an interview with Rolling Stone. It 
may be a stretch, but the way he talks 
about being humbled by the sport 
in the interview and one quote in 
particular — “You’re new when you 
get out of the water” — make it feel 
like the new hobby has influenced 
his songwriting. More so than Fleet 
Foxes and Helplessness Blues (save 
for the titular track), Crack-Up jux-
taposes the hugeness of nature with 
the, well, helplessness of humankind. 
Choices like the aforementioned 
opening of “I Am All That I Need” 
and the album’s obsession with the 
ocean — every song contains some 
reference to an ocean, sea, flood or 
tides — lend to this, creating the feel-
ing that the album is just big in a geo-
graphical sense.

Since completing the band’s tour 

in support of Helplessness Blues in 
2012, Pecknold has been on a jour-
ney through himself and through 
academia in an unfamiliar city. He 
has shed his lumberjack look for 
something cleaner and seems to 
have given the “capital-q” Ques-
tions of his life 
a lot of thought. 
The result is an 
expansive epic, an 
album that both 
builds satisfyingly 
on the legacy left 
by the first two but also feels like 
a fresh starting point. In a recent 
interview with Pitchfork, Pec-
knold is quoted as saying “I’d like 
to just make another album right 
now.” If Crack-Up is any indication 
of what’s to come, we should take 
as much as we can get.

Let’s start this “Cars 3” review 

by talking about Rocky. The Ital-
ian Stallion’s most recent outings, 
“Rocky Balboa” and “Creed,” respec-
tively featured Rocky dealing with a 
world that was seemingly leaving 
him behind and training the son of 
his late best friend. I open with this 
because everything done in those 
two separate movies, “Cars 3” tries 
to do in one. In one movie, Lightning 
McQueen (Owen Wilson, “Mas-
terminds”) is supposed to come to 
terms with the changing landscape 
of racing while mentoring a younger 
character and making peace with his 
legacy. Its story hinges on these arcs, 
yet by the time the credits roll, nei-
ther of them has been given enough 
attention to carry the movie. In its 
rush to do everything, “Cars 3” does 
nothing instead.

It’s hard to even decipher what 

the main story of the movie is 

supposed to be. 
The gist of it at 
first seems to be 
that 
Lightning 

has to prove that 
he’s not washed 
up. That’s simple 

enough and potentially emotional. 
The problem is that it’s not clear 
who Lightning has to prove that to. 
Is it himself? No, he’s as confident as 
ever. His friends? They barely fea-
ture. The only people who we ever 
see doubt Lightning only appear on 
TV screen to remind you that this is 
allegedly an underdog story, but by 
the end, even the crowd is still on 
Lightning’s side. It’s like the ordinar-
ily brilliant minds at Pixar wanted to 
tell an underdog story but forgot to 
add the underdog. There’s no doubt 
on anyone’s part — least of all the 
audience’s — that he will win until 
far too late in the movie.

If Lightning’s struggle had been 

focused on and developed a bit more 
it could have worked and worked 
well, but then comes the other part 
of the story: Lightning mentoring 

newcomer Cruz Ramirez (Cristela 
Alonzo, “Cristela”). In theory, Cruz is 
supposed to share the spotlight with 
Lightning. It’s clear this it’s meant to 
be her story as much as it is his, but 
as with Lightning’s struggle, she is 
never given enough focus to make 
her anything other than a jumped-
up side character in her own movie. 
It’s hard to care about her when she 
is distracting from his story and he is 
distracting from hers.

“Cars 3” should have either been 

Lightning’s story with Cruz playing 
a supporting role or vice versa. As it 
is, it splits its focus between the two, 
seems to finally put it on Lightning, 
then pulls back and puts it on Cruz, 
only to finally cop out in the worst 
way possible and try to give them 
both Big Emotional Endings without 
having properly done the character 
or story work to earn those moments. 
It cheats and continues to cheat even 
when it makes no sense. Finally, in 
the late second act, “Cars 3” arrives 
at an interesting place that could 
potentially sustain both stories. But 
by that time, it’s too late. It can only 
spend a few scenes in that interesting 
new setting with its interesting new 
characters before it’s time for the cli-
max that no one in the audience will 
care enough to get excited for.

As per the Pixar norm, the ani-

mation is quite spectacular. The 
environments are nearly photore-
alistic, especially during the oth-
erwise lackluster racing scenes, 
and that complements the more 
cartoony designs of the characters 
to create an effect like the one on 
display in “The Good Dinosaur.” 
That’s almost all that can be said for 
“Cars 3,” though. It’s not even clear 
what the lesson kids are supposed 
to learn is. Do your best? Even if this 
wasn’t Pixar — possibly the best sto-
rytellers not just in animation but 
in cinema itself — that’s boilerplate 
and boring. But in a way, that sums 
up “Cars 3” quite well. For a normal 
animation house, this would be a 
subpar, pointless flick. For the mas-
ters themselves, it comes close to 
being their worst work so far.

When Lorde won the Billboard 

Music Award for Top Rock Song, 
with “Royals” in 2014, she turned 
her fists into rocker horns with a 
confused expression on her face. 
Her smash single had won her an 
award in a category that not even 
she thought she deserved to place 
in — a testament to her artistry, 
skill and charm. Her sophomore 
album Melodrama was released on 
June 16th, a culmination of four 
years of work, crafted by a young 
artist who isn’t afraid to poke fun 
at herself.

Despite 
being 
the 
dreaded 

sophomore album, Melodrama sur-
passes Pure Heroine creatively. The 
persona of Lorde has outgrown her 
teenage ennui and has developed 
into a thoughtful, tender young 
adult unafraid to embrace her 
experience. While songs off Pure 
Heroine repeat a similar theme in 
a different manner, Melodrama 
offers a complete experience of 
thought, emotion and expression.

The sound of her sophomore 

album is rich and diverse. Singles 
“Green Light” and “Perfect Places” 
are energetic tracks comprised 
of driving percussion and heavy 
synth. Others like “Liability” and 
“Writer in the Dark” are made 
soley by the accompaniment of gui-
tar or piano to Lorde’s voice. These 
emotional ballads are reminiscent 
of the compositions that dominat-
ed Pure Heroine, but brought to 
a new level by traditional instru-
ments. Melodrama takes the old 
formula, mixes it up and adds 
another step.

Vocally, Lorde stretches herself 

to embody a distinct feeling on 
each song. Her voice starts husky 
on the first track, but by the pre-
chorus of “Homemade Dynamite,” 
it has morphed into breathy sighs. 
On the deeply poignant ballad 
“Liability,” Lorde croons in a full, 
warm voice to contrast the cold 
sounds of the piano. By “Writer 
in the Dark,” she coughs and spits 
each note out, her voice frayed. 
These two tracks demonstrate 
the remarkable nuance in Lorde’s 
delivery that is evocative and pow-
erful. On “Hard Feelings/Love-
less” and “Liability (Reprise),” 
Lorde’s voice is warped and mold-
ed by a harmonizer.

Apart 
from 
her 
impressive 

growth as a singer, Lorde has cata-
pulted to new heights as a com-
positional artist. She manages to 
balance the tragedy and comedy 
of the break-up that inspired the 
record without seeming “melodra-
matic” or insincere. Lines like “So 
they pull back, make other plans 
/ I understand, I’m a liability” are 
mocked by “Are you lost in us? / 
Have another drink get lost in us 
/ This is how we get notorious.” 
While in opposition, there’s a ten-
derness and an edge to Lorde’s 
candor, that by some sleight of 
hand rub together to make magic. 
Other moments reveal Lorde’s 
flirtatious and adventurous side, 
as written on “Homemade Dyna-
mite”: “See me rolling, showing 
someone else love / Hands under 
your t-shirt / Know I think you’re 
awesome, right?” She is far from 
the 16-year-old girl who sang of 
“craving a different kind of buzz” 
four years earlier.

Lorde has always shone as a 

lyricist; every line off Pure Hero-
ine is poetry, and Melodrama is no 
exception. Multiple songs ditch 
traditional rhyme schemes in 
favor of slant rhymes and from 
her synthesia comes vivid and 
miraculous images: “I’d get your 
friend to drive, but he can hardly 
see / We’ll end up painted on the 
road, red and chrome, all the bro-
ken glass sparkling / I guess we’re 
partying.” Always incisive, Lorde 
critiques teen culture while impli-
cating 
herself. 

However, we can 
take the bitter 
with the sweet, 
as 
so 
many 

songs are heart-
achingly tender: 
“Blow all my friendships / To sit 
in hell with you / But we’re the 
greatest / They’ll hang us in The 
Louvre.”

In a pop music market that 

often feels dry and repetitive, 
Lorde is as refreshing and origi-
nal as she was four years ago. Her 
work has an element of artistry 
that eschews the mainstream idea 
of pop stardom. Melodrama, just 
like Pure Heroine, is filled with 
hidden treasures: keen insight, 
a full heart and youthful charm. 
Lorde is an artist you can put faith 
in.

Summer Editor in Chief

“What you need to know is that 

my life is split in two, cleaved not so 
neatly. There is the before and the 
after. Before I gained weight. After 
I gained weight. Before I was raped. 
After I was raped.”

“I began to eat to change my body. 

I was willful in this.”

Renowned writer Roxane Gay 

presented her new book, “Hunger: 
A Memoir of (My) Body,” to a crowd 
of over a thousand gathered in Hill 
Auditorium this past Friday, where 
she discussed her process writing 
the difficult moments of her life as 
well as the social faults in approach-
ing weight and sexault assault.

The event was hosted by Lite-

rati Bookstore. According to event 
organizers, “Hunger” is already the 
store’s bestselling book. Gay is well 
known for her series of essays titled 
“Bad Feminist” and her novel “Ayiti,” 
and she is the first Black female lead 
author for Marvel in a Black Panther 
series “Wakanda.”

“So I have a new book out called 

‘Hunger.’ Because I’m a masochist,” 
she said. “But really, this is a book 
about my body. Often times when 
you are overweight, or fat, your body 
becomes a public text, and people 
project a lot of bullshit about your 
body. A lot of things like why you’re 
fat, why you don’t lose weight, and 
so with this book, I wanted to rede-
scribe the narrative of my own body. 
To tell the story about my body in my 
own words.”

Two passages were read from 

“Hunger.” One is about her time 
with her physical trainer — “I have 
a membership to Planet Fitness, 
although I have never visited. Basi-
cally I donate $19.99 to Planet Fit-
ness every month,” Gay said.

The other is her search for and 

imagining the confrontation with 
the man who assaulted her years 
later. Gay was 12 years old when her 
classmate, along with several other 
boys, raped her.

“I Googled him when I wrote this 

book. I don’t know why. Or I do,” she 
read. “I sat for hours, staring at his 
picture on the webpage on his com-
pany’s website. It nauseates me. I 
can smell him.”

She admits that writing “Hun-

ger,” revealing her vulnerabilities, 
made the process much more dif-

ficult than her previous work. Gay 
explained writing usually comes 
more naturally to her — therefore, 
the hesitancy she was facing in 
writing “Hunger” was a new expe-
rience.

“I am used to words coming 

quickly. With this book... when I 
was trying to figure out the scope 
of this book, I thought and thought 
and thought. When I got some-
where where it made me uncom-
fortable, I would stop,” Gay said. 
“And so there was nothing to write, 
because there was nothing going 
on in my head at all. And so ‘I don’t 
want to go there.’ And so, I found 
myself forcing myself to go to those 
places I did not want to go.” 

“Oh my God, it was just coming 

out in the most painful paragraphs. 
And for me, it was a foreign experi-
ence. Usually it’s great, but this was 
just shitty paragraph after shitty 
paragraph. I kept looking at it like, 
‘Who is this person?’”

While the new memoir revealed 

much of Gay’s personal thoughts, 
she also set up borders for topics 
she would stray away from such as 
details about her relationships or 
some of her experiences. 

“I really stick to my gut where 

my boundaries are concerned... I 
remind myself, I am allowed to have 
boundaries,” she said. “I am allowed 
to tell people ‘no,’ even though they 
are good people. You don’t have to 
give people everything they want.”

“Hunger” was delayed, forcing 

Gay to write it faster.

“It was just difficult. I think fac-

ing yourself is difficult,” she said. 
“Looking at your body and looking 
at all of the baggage I have been car-
rying along with being fat, baggage 
that is not mine to carry but I car-
ried nonetheless, was challenging... 
It was worth the delay. Anything I 
would have put out June 2016 would 
have been mediocre at best.”

One audience member, who said 

she was nervous in writing a memoir 
on a similar topic, asked if Gay had 
any fear of her attacker’s retaliation. 
Gay explained she kept all of the 
details of the assault vague and used 
pseudonyms.

“Lastly, I would say that we 

often fear retaliation, and it’s totally 
understandable... one of the things 
you can try to do is look that fear for 
what it is and try not to let that fear 
be an obstacle to writing what needs 

to be written,” she answered.

Reactions to weight were a cen-

tral point of discussion — especially 
the term “fat”, and how it has been 
fashioned to become an insult.

“What they are conceiving is that 

‘fat’ is an insult. That I am insulting 
myself,” she said.

However, Gay finds the term 

“overweight” to be worse — 
implying that there is a normal 
weight. “Obese” or other medical 
terms have also left her with neg-
ative experience from doctors.

“As a fat, Black woman, I am 

sometimes degendered. I am 
called ‘sir.’ Every day, I am called 
‘sir.’ Which is weird, because I 
have huge boobs. It’s just like, 
they are magnificent,” she said, 
explaining the conception that 
being fat takes away feminin-
ity. “There is always this cultural 
baggage in this intersection of 
Blackness and fatness. And, it’s 
challenging. It’s really challeng-
ing... But I find that the Black 
community tends to be far more 
accepting of body diversity.”

Throughout the event, Gay 

was also asked about her opin-
ions on Black Panther (“It was 
so 
sexy.”), 
the 
Bachelorette 

(thrilled to see “31 mediocre 
white men” court an exceptional 
Black woman. “It’s about god-
damn time.” “Collectively, those 
31 dudes make half a good man.”), 
and the Handmaiden’s Tale (one 
of Gay’s favorite books, accord-
ing to an audience member. Gay 
said she loved the first episodes, 
but stopped watching in disbe-
lief after hearing the cast say it 
wasn’t a feminist work)

As the event neared an end, 

Gay was asked how many users 
she blocked on her active Twit-
ter (her bio: “If you clap, I clap 
back.”): over 2,700 users. “I 
block people every single day. 
Because people are trash.”

When 
asked 
if 
“Hunger” 

allowed 
some 
healing, 
Gay 

explained that in the beginning 
of writing, she would have said 
“no,” as she had to look at dif-
ficult stages of her life.

“I feel now I am finally in a 

position in my life to truly move 
forward in a way I haven’t been 
before,” she said. “So yes, it 
turns out that writing this book 
was healing.”

New chair of DNC emphasizes change within party

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Daily Summer News Editor

Several of the most prominent 

figures within the Democratic Party 
convened Saturday morning at the 

Renaissance Center in Detroit for the 
Democratic National Committee’s 
seasonal 
executive 
committee 

meeting, 
where 
the 
committee 

discussed its transition and strategy 
for elections going forward.

As one of the first such meetings 

for newly-elected DNC Chair Tom 
Perez, much of the talk centered 
around the “culture change” he 
intends to effect within the party. 
After narrowly defeating Rep. Keith 
Ellison (D–Minn.) in the contest for 
chair in February, Perez received 

criticism for being part of the party 
establishment that had failed to listen 
and appeal to the more progressive 
wing of the party. During the meeting, 
Perez sought to show he understood 
the need for change within the party, 
emphasizing a turn toward a culture 
of inclusion.

The organization of the meeting 

room itself, Perez said — with four 
long tables arranged into a square, 
so all of the over 50 members of the 
executive committee were facing 
each other — was proof of that.

“One 
of 
the 
dimensions 
of 

this culture change has to be our 
interaction with our members,” 
he said. “We’ve heard loudly and 
clearly that you are under-utilized. 
We are changing that. And we want 
to change that together. I’ve asked a 
lot of people who have been to many 
executive 
committee 
meetings, 

‘What has often happened?’ And 
all too frequently, many of you have 
been able to walk out not having been 
called on to offer your opinions on 
anything.”

The second dimension of the 

culture change, Perez said, was 
rethinking the committee’s mission 
statement.

“We have to clarify, because it 

seems to me that the de facto mission 
statement of the DNC had been that 
we are here to help elect the President 
of the United States, the Democrat, 
every fourth year,” he said. “And it’s 
borne out in our structure. So we 
have absolutely changed our mission 
statement. Our mission statement is 
to elect Democrats up and down the 
ticket, from the school board to the 
senate.”

Ellison, who Perez named deputy 

chair moments after becoming chair 
himself, said the culture change 
needed to include the way the party 
interacts with voters as well as its 
own members.

“The way that we’re going to win 

elections is not only by persuading 
people but also by getting new people 
into the fold that we haven’t talked 
to,” he said. “90 million people didn’t 
vote in the last election that were 
eligible to do so.”

Many members of the committee 

reacted positively to Perez’s message, 
saying they had already experienced 
a change in the few months he had 
been Chair.

Earl Fowlkes, who has been a 

member of the DNC for eight years 
and the Chair of the DNC’s LGBT 
Caucus for four years, said it was 
the first opportunity he’d ever had 
to speak in an executive committee 

meeting.

“Basically, I see us having 3 

protocols,” he said. “And one of 
them is the right to advise the 
leadership, the other is the right to 
warn leadership, and the other right 
is to be consulted by leadership. And 
I think when those protocols are not 
adhered to, as they haven’t always 
been in my time here, the DNC is off-
kilter, because we represent the core 
constituencies of this party, and we 
have to be in the mainstream of the 
decision-making process so that we 
can strengthen our party.”

Other 
members, 
however, 

expressed they still didn’t feel 
included by the party.

Louis Elrod, President of the Young 

Democrats of America, pointed 
out that for the level of support for 
Democrats from young people, they 
weren’t very well represented in the 
committee. Asking how many of 
them were millennials, fewer than 
five people at the table raised their 
hands.

“Even being the Democratic 

Party, knowing that we have this 
generation leaning towards us, 
we still do not have the voice — 
in numbers at least — that we 
need,” he said. “We have existing 
infrastructures that no one invested 
in last year. No one. No one invested 
in our organizations to try to turn 
out young people, at all. And if that 
continues again, we are going to lose 
heavily in 2018.”

Before Elrod finished with his 

remarks, however, Perez cut him 
off, citing the need to give everyone 
the opportunity to speak in a short 
period of time.

“I’m sorry, but it’s the first time 

I’ve been given access to talk to you 
here,” Elrod said.

Even being the 

Democratic 

Party, knowing 
that we have this 
generation leaning 
towards us, we still 

do not have the 

voice — in numbers 
at least — that we 

need

quated system of societal expec-
tations. Looking out from your 
own community at the world in 
front of you, you’re only ever told 
by those inside of it to submit to 
what is the norm of those around 
you, and in that regard you try to 
do your best to conform.

Pride in itself is not a pride-

ful trait; to freely boast your 
strengths and exist as yourself in 
any raw and uninhibited form is a 
symbol of anything but pride, but 
rather the most profound weak-
ness. It’s a largely cultural aspect 
for where these views come from. 
There’s like this unspoken sin to 
deviate from conformity in the 
Vietnamese community I came 
from, and not only being out, but 
being openly out is seen as just 
about the pinnacle of all sins, on 
par with not taking your shoes off 
when you come inside and disre-
specting your elders. So much of 
my culture is marked by obedi-
ence and reverence to our elders 
and following long held tradi-
tions, so to deviate from common 
practice is just about the worst 
possible thing you could ever do. 
It was the amalgamation of all 
of these things that made me so 
scared and forced me to hide for 
so long. I became very familiar 
with the closet, so the moment 
where I didn’t feel the need to 
hide in there anymore, I chose to 
take every opportunity to become 
myself and make up for lost time.

To be gay is to be resilient, but 

it is an incredibly lonely place to 
come of age in. Nobody ever tells 
you how incredibly lonely it can 
be. You grow up questioning these 
expectations placed upon you 
before you have the vocabulary 
to be able to vocalize and defend 
yourself. You grow up bombarded 
by both media that does not rep-

On pride 
and being 

out

By KHANG HUYNH

Michigan in Color Contributor

For eighteen years of my life my 

mother’s arms were the warmest 
home I ever knew. A home for 
when I felt scared or lonely or 
sad. What an actual home lacked 
in structural support, my mother 
made up for in love and kindness. 
For eighteen years this home 
allowed me to grow and learn and 
supported me in every endeavor 
until the day I felt this unnerving 
urge to tell her that I was gay. No, 
that I am gay. Like I mean I was 
gay in the past tense as I retell 
this story but I also still am very 
gay and like … you get my point. 

Okay but anyways, at this point 

in my life, everyone except my 
immediate family knew of me 
being gay, like it wasn’t really 
hard to guess; I didn’t really try 
to hide it. Like even if I was trying 
to hide it, I wasn’t doing that hot 
of a job at doing so. Why was it so 
hard to tell the most loving per-
son in my life what I had openly 
told to so many strangers before? 
Okay to be fair, coming out to 
strangers and friends never war-
ranted the fear of being kicked 
out of my own home, which was a 
valid excuse for me to hide myself 
for so long to my own mother. I 
don’t really remember exactly 
what led up to me finally com-
ing out to my her; everything’s 
just really hazy and sad, but I do 
remember that it just really need-
ed to be done, and as I was tell-
ing her what I needed to tell her, I 
was doing so through this flood of 
tears, and it wasn’t anything cute 
either. I cried so hard my contact 
lenses fell out and my entire face 
was swelling up from the tears 
and the snot … It was the imme-
diate opposite aesthetic of this 
emotionally strong and well-put-
together person that I try so hard 
to build up as myself. As I was 
going through this profoundly 
hideous breakdown, my mother 
didn’t really know what to do. She 
tried to tell me it was okay but she 
also didn’t want to touch or hold 
me. This home she had built for 
me couldn’t hold the well of emo-
tions she was feeling. She just 
told me that things would be okay 

in between my teary gasping and 
just sat at the side of my bed for 
awhile.

We don’t really talk about it 

now. You know the whole gay 
thing. Like it’s just something we 
both know is there but neglect to 
bring up like some big fabulously 
gay elephant in the room. But the 
fact of the matter was that I was 
out. I didn’t need to hide any-
more.

Coming out and being out is 

this really weird and often real-
ly touchy subject that’s unique 
to 
the 
LGBTQ+ 
community. 

Everyone who is out in this com-
munity has their own story of 
how their coming out went that 
ranges anywhere from pleasant 
to heartbreaking. Like much of 
everything else in the world, it’s 
a spectrum from good to bad to 
maybe even horrendous, but it’s 
also not this once in a lifetime 
event either. Something that a lot 
of people don’t realize is that com-
ing out isn’t this end all be all. It’s 
a reoccurring event. I will always 
have to come out to every person I 
meet in some way or another, ver-
bal or otherwise. I feel like this 
is where I can explain the bulk 
of my personality; it’s so much 
easier to be overtly and openly 
gay and make things very clear 
right up front than to have to say 
that you are gay to every person 
that you meet. It’s not that I feel 
any shame in being gay, but it’s 
just different to have to say that 
you are something as opposed to 
just freely being it. The only thing 
was, this practice of my open 
gayness was a newfound source 
of contention; the home of this 
social friction I would feel from 
so many people.

There’s something very sub-

versive 
about 
simultaneously 

being Asian and being openly gay. 
From both the outside looking 
in and inside looking out you’re 
almost required to uphold this 
certain group of expectations for 
yourself that contradict the very 
core of being out and being proud 
of yourself. Looking in from the 
outside world you’re expected to 
be this submissive figure of con-
formity. All that you say and do 
must follow a stringent mold of 
what is expected from you; you 
know, the whole model minor-
ity bullshit and all that comes 
from it. What is expected of you 
is silence. Nobody likes to hear 
from a loud gay, and god forbid 
hearing things from an Asian one 
who has meaningful things to say 
when all that is expected from 
them is obedience to an anti-

resent you and systems of hatred 
and prejudice that force you to 
hide for so much of your life out of 
this fear that the feelings of guilt, 

self-hatred and fear itself become 
a part of your identity. Nobody 
really speaks about how exhaust-
ing it is to have to validate your 
right to coexist. You feel as if your 
queerness is unwelcome in these 
overwhelmingly unqueer spaces. 
The thing is, nobody ever asks to 
be gay. Nobody asks to be treated 
like how so many of us have been 
and have to overcome the many 
struggles that our identity brings 
to us, but to be gay is to also be an 
overwhelming pillar of strength. 
In helping others, you bring up 
these memories that aren’t always 
easy to retell to yourself, let alone 
others, but in doing so, you kind 
of get to see how strong you are, 
to have overcome the many hard-
ships that being gay can bring to 
you. It’s like you’ve almost forgot-
ten all that you’ve needed to do to 
simply be here today. I find praise 
from others at my uninhibited 
love and expression of my identity 
so strange sometimes. Like why 
wouldn’t you want to freely be 
yourself? I would always find their 

kind words to be so … off putting? 
But then I remember that sim-
ply being gay in itself is an act of 
resistance and it’s a privilege that 
is not afforded to everyone. Being 
gay and being out is a powerful act 
of declaring your right to simply 
exist at all. You have to be proud 
of yourself and all you have been 
through, a practice much easier 
said than done.

I feel like that is the defining 

message of gay pride and pride 
month. You acknowledge the pain 
and difficulty both you and your 
community have not only gone 
through, but overcome as well. 
Not only have we survived, but 
we have thrived and shall con-
tinue to do so. We have this huge 
shared experience of learning to 
love ourselves, and the journey 
toward doing so is not always an 
easy one. It’s this journey some-
times marked with more downs 
than ups, and I feel like I’m just 
throwing out these analogies and 
sayings, but that’s just really how 
it really feels. From being beaten 
down so many times you grow this 
thick skin, both good and bad in its 
effects, but I think the major idea 
of pride is that we cannot close in 
on ourselves. We can’t close in on 
ourselves and expect a change to 
come. This thick skin of ours was 
formed to deflect the hatred of 
others and allow us a closer under-
standing of those like us. I think 
the ultimate end goal would be to 
learn for ourselves how our ideal 
sense of self resonates and reflects 
in the context of the greater com-
munity. We must learn how to 
coexist and take care of one anoth-
er and learn to grow from our 
shared hardships. In doing so, we 
can truly resonate with the love, 
happiness and empathy behind 
what it truly means to be prideful.

To be gay is 
to be resilient, 

but it is an 
incredibly 

lonely place to 
come of age 

in.

Lorde is ethereal perfection at album release 
show in New York

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Online Arts Editor

AVERY FRIEDMAN

Daily Arts Writer

A mood hung over Manhat-

tan last Friday — maybe due to 
the low grey clouds mixed with 
summer humidity — but weather 
notwithstanding, it was bound to 
be a Melodramatic day as Lorde’s 
second 
LP 
filled 
the 
space 

between the headphones and ear 
drums of morning commuters 
with magic. About 12 hours later 
she would fill Bowery Ballroom 
with that same magic.

The dichotomy of a day at the 

office blurred by monotony and 
a night of the town blurred by 
youth (and various substances) 
isn’t lost on Lorde or her fans; 
the ephemeralness of youth and 
inescapability of adulthood can 
be heard on Melodrama front to 
back. When the lights went down, 
a sliver of light shone through 
the cracked stage door and those 
lucky to be close enough got a 
glimpse of Lorde (real name Ella 
Yelich-O’Connor) amping her-
self up, jumping around in white 
Adidas tennis shoes. Opening the 
show with “Homemade Dyna-
mite” (one of Melodrama’s many 
highlights), Lorde appropriately 
sets expectations: quickly flow-
ing pre-choruses that melt into 
luscious refrains to keep all the 
dancers in the crowd on their 
toes.

Lorde continued through her 

release-day show with an excit-
able effortlessness. Her visible 
giddiness from sharing songs 
that once belonged to only her 
combined with her signature, 
flailing 
dance 
moves 
served 

up an inarguable authenticity. 
Flexing all of her performative 
muscles, Lorde shifted between 
moments of live magic at the 
hands of nuanced production 
(the seconds of quiet in “The 
Louvre”) and open connection 
with the crowd via gut-wrench-
ing lyrics (one attendee sobbed 
during “Liability”). “Everyone 
leaves,” she said of her thoughts 
while writing the latter.

But the 20-year-old’s ability 

to infuse the air with her energy, 
through her music, is nearly 
unmatched in music’s current 
landscape, which became clear 
during an a capella encore of “Writ-
er In the Dark.” Quieting a scream-
ing crowd, she began without a mic 
except when it would pick up her 
echo as she moved from one side 
of the stage to another. Exuding 
power and confidence, she shushed 
the front row of a packed Bowery 
Ballroom so even those in the back 
could hear the raw, unplugged 
delivery. It has always been clear 
that Lorde is an extremely talented 
writer and artist, but her perfor-
mance of “Writer In the Dark” 
showcased an emotive strength of 
voice to be reckoned with.

The magic of Lorde, Melodrama 

and the show rests with feeling: the 
tingling rush of new love, the dull, 
prolonged sting of loneliness, the 

fear that “someday” might actually 
be today and the restlessness in try-
ing to make sense of them all.

— Christian Kennedy
It wasn’t long after I found out 

I’d be spending a few hot months 
in New York City that I estab-
lished my primary goal for the 
summer: befriend Ella Yelich-
O’Connor, a.k.a Lorde. Before the 
singer’s anthemic single “Green-
light” dropped in March, I hadn’t 
considered myself a superfan, 
but let’s just say that Lorde’s new 
heartbroken-twentysomething-
spends-summer-in-the-city aes-
thetic hit home and cemented 
“Greenlight,” and consequently 
the rest her new album, as sta-
ples within the soundtrack of my 
subway commutes.

Last Friday afternoon, I was 

at work attempting (unsuccess-
fully) to write a coherent article 
while taking in the magnitude 
of the just-released Melodrama, 
when Christian (see above) text-
ed me: “OMFG Lorde is doing a 
show at the Bowery Ballroom 
tonight.” Lorde had tweeted 
about the show in New York just 
hours before she was set to take 
the stage; And after a couple of 
frantic emails and eventually 
just showing up, we managed to 
find ourselves in the second-row 
of the sensual Bowery Ballroom, 
just one really-long-arm’s-length 
from the stage.

The surrounding crowd was a 

mixed bag of characters tethered 
together by a common radiat-
ing enamoredness with Lorde. 
Throughout the evening, two 
different audience members told 
me, “Pure Heroine is the only 
reason I made it through high 
school.” A fifty-something year-
old man to my left glanced at his 
fourteen year-old daughter, an 
aspiring musician, and said, “You 
know, we have immense respect 
for Lorde, she’s really an inspi-
ration for my daughter.” To my 
right, a mid-twenties Brooklyn-
based music blogger anxiously 
clutched a thick packet of papers: 
an old college essay about Lorde 
that he planned to toss onto the 
stage. Lorde’s crowds aren’t 
limited to one demographic, but 
rather a diverse group of individ-
uals who feel an intense, electric 
kinship with the artist.

Across 
ages, 
genders 
and 

sexual orientations, there was a 
deliberate, almost studious dedi-
cation in the way we sang word-
for-word the lyrics of Melodrama 
tracks that had been released 
only a few hours earlier; just as 
there was an instinctual, vis-
ceral way in which some wept 
as Lorde sat and crooned “Lia-
bility” at the stoop of the stage. 
That’s the thing about Lorde — at 
only 20, she infuses her melodies 
with a dangerous concoction of 
intellectualism and emotional 
insight that grants her special 
access to our minds as well as 
our hearts.

I walked out of the Bowery 

Ballroom last Friday haunted by 
the echoes of Lorde’s encore — 
an acapella rendition of “Writer 
in the Dark.” She had tenderly 
hushed the crowd as she sang 
in an octave that rang more like 
a whimper: “I am my mother’s 
child, I’ll love you ‘til my breath-
ing stops.” In that final chorus, 
Lorde captured the essence of 
her second album: the paradoxi-
cal coexistence of all-consuming 
love and longing alongside a keen 
awareness of the melodrama of 
youth.

Soccer recruit Umar Farouk Osman, pictured with New York City FC’s Jack Harrison, was named the Gatorade National Player of the Year.

Michigan soccer recruit named 
Gatorade Player of the Year

Incoming 
Michigan 
soccer 

recruit Umar Farouk Osman 
earned the Gatorade National 
Boys’ Soccer Player of the Year 
award last week. The 5-foot-
9 midfielder scored 19 goals 
and added six assists for his 
Hotchkiss, Conn. squad.

Osman will be the second 

member 
of 
the 
Wolverines 

from Hotchkiss as well as the 
second player from Ghana, along 
with junior midfielder Francis 
Atuahene. The two played with 
each other in high school, and 
Osman is looking forward to 
joining his fellow Ghanaian once 
again.

“I knew him way back before 

we came to the 
United 
States,” 

Osman said. “At 
Hotchkiss we had 
a great bond. I 
always looked up 
to him and I’d go 
to him for advice. 
He’d tell what to 
do and what not 
to do.

“I can’t wait 

to play with him. 
He’s a very dangerous player 
with a lot of pace, so I can’t 
wait to play with him, connect 

passes with him and run with 
him.”

Last 
season, 
Osman 
was 

named the 2016 
Connecticut 
Soccer 
Coaches 

Association’s 
Player 
of 
the 

Year. 
During 

the 
campaign, 

Osman 
had 
a 

direct 
hand 
in 

28 of Hotchkiss’ 
30 
goals. 
For 

his 
career 
at 

Hotchkiss, 
he 

accumulated 63 goals and 45 
assists in total.

Osman aims to attend the 

Stephen M. Ross School of 
Business at Michigan because 
he believes it is one of the best in 

the world.

Away 
from 

the 
classroom 

and on the pitch 
at 
U-M 
Soccer 

Stadium, Osman 
is 
excited 
by 

Michigan 
coach 

Chaka 
Daley’s 

style of play. He’s 
also encouraged 
by 
the 
kind 

and 
welcoming 

atmosphere Daley has fostered 
in Ann Arbor.

“I like the system he plays 

with,” Osman said. “He doesn’t 
just want to attack, attack and 
attack. He likes to keep the ball, 

play good soccer 
and I really like 
that a lot.”

Within 
that 

locker 
room 

though, 
is 

something 
else 

that 
epitomizes 

what 
attracts 

Osman 
to 

Michigan 
— 
a 

sign 
that 
led 

him 
to 
commit 

to the Wolverines. It’s a sign 
that combines his passion for 
teamwork and friendliness.

“There’s a writing that says 

‘the team, the team, the team’, 
and it really speaks a lot to 
me,” 
Osman 
said. 
“Because 

everything is about the team. 
It’s not just about the individual. 
It doesn’t matter how talented 
you are. You have to put the 
team ahead of you before you do 
anything else.”

At Michigan, he’ll look to 

take those lessons on the field 
in order to help a team that 
finished with just four wins last 
season.

With Atuahene by his side 

and Daley advising from afar, 
Osman looks like he could be in 
the right place.

Osman scored 

19 goals for 

his Hotchkiss, 
Conn. squad.

“It really speaks 

a lot to me. 

Everything is 

about the team.”

Michigan adds Muckalt 
as associate head coach

To say Bill Muckalt and Mel 

Pearson have some shared history 
would be an understatement.

With Pearson — now the head 

coach of the Michigan hockey 
team — as assistant 
coach, 
Muckalt 

helped lead the 
Wolverines 
to 

two 
national 

championships, 
in 1996 and 1998, 
as a player. Then, 
after 
a 
lengthy 

professional 
hockey 
career, 

Muckalt 
joined 

Pearson’s staff at 
Michigan Tech as an assistant 
coach between 2011 and 2015.

Now, the pair will be reunited 

once 
again 
after 
Michigan 

officially announced Muckalt’s 
hiring as associate head coach 
Tuesday.

“Billy has had great success 

everywhere he has coached,” 
Pearson said in a statement 
Tuesday. 
“Having 
won 
two 

national 
championships, 
he 

is familiar with the winning 
tradition of Michigan hockey.

“Billy will be a 

great addition to 
our staff, and I’m 
extremely excited 
to be bringing him 
back to Ann Arbor. 
Our players will 
really benefit from 
his experience and 
knowledge of the 
game.”

Muckalt’s 

rise 
through 

the coaching ranks has been 
remarkable. 
He 
began 
his 

coaching career in 2006 as an 
assistant with Eastern Michigan 
University; in the next four 
years, 
he 
would 
hold 
three 

head coaching jobs — with the 
Eagles, the Valencia Flyers of the 
Western States Hockey League 
and the New Mexico Mustangs 
of the North American Hockey 
League, respectively.

In 
2011, 
he 
departed 
the 

Mustangs to become an assistant 
once more — this time under 
Pearson as he sought to rebuild 
the Huskies.

Under Pearson and Muckalt’s 

direction, 
Michigan 
Tech 

reached 
unforeseen 
heights, 

posting a nation-
best 
29-win 

season in 2014 — 
its first 20-win 
season in over 30 
years — that also 
included a No. 1 
national ranking 
and 
an 
NCAA 

Tournament 
berth.

Muckalt left the 

Huskies in 2015 to 

become a head coach once more — 
this time for the Tri-City Storm 
of the United States Hockey 
League, where he was also named 
general manager. In his first year, 
the Storm won their first-ever 
championship.

Muckalt’s hiring at Michigan 

appears to round out Pearson’s 
staff — one with a lot of familiar 
faces and ties to the program.

Brian 
Wiseman 
and 
Steve 

Shields, both of whom are also 
prominent alumni, will return 

after 
serving 

as 
assistant 

coaches 
under 

former coach Red 
Berenson.

“I am humbled 

and 
privileged 

to 
be 
back 
at 

Michigan — it’s 
a special place,” 
Muckalt 
said 

in 
a 
statement 

Tuesday. 
“I’m 

excited to work with Mel again 
and looking forward to working 
with Brian (Wiseman), Steve 
(Shields) and the rest of the staff.

“I can’t wait to start getting 

to know our student-athletes 
and helping them develop and 
help them reach their dreams 
and goals. I look forward to 
embracing the tradition and 
enriching the future of Michigan 
Hockey.”

Oliver Jaskie was drafted in the sixth round of the MLB Draft by the Seattle Mariners.

Michigan baseball draft update

Before the 2017 season began, 

Michigan baseball coach Erik Bakich 
pointed to the five Wolverines 
selected in the previous year’s MLB 
Draft as emblematic of the long-term 
success and culture he has aimed to 
create.

“That’s the nature of the beast 

in quality programs, (you) try to 
build the best program you can,” 
Bakich said in February. “One of the 
impacts of that is that the players are 
going to develop and get drafted to 
professional baseball.”

After Michigan’s first 40-win 

season since 2008 and its second 
NCAA 
Tournament 
bid 
under 

Bakich, the 2017 MLB Draft served 
as an even stronger representation of 
Bakich’s efforts to build the quality 
program he has envisioned. The 
Wolverines had a school-record 11 
players selected in the MLB Draft last 
week, which also tied for the most of 
any college program. 

It’s also significantly more than the 

five that were drafted last season, and 
also includes seven underclassmen, 
who have the option to forego signing 
a professional contract and return 
to school. Depending on how many 
of those 11 players actually sign with 
major league teams, the 2018 season 
could be the greatest test for Bakich’s 
potential dynasty, in terms of the 
rebuilding necessary for sustained 
success.

The Daily looks at Michigan’s 2017 

draftees and breaks down which 
players have signed professional 
contracts, which players have not 
and what these decisions, along with 
the departure of the Wolverines’ 
seniors, mean for next season.

Junior 
left-hander 
Oliver 

Jaskie (Seattle Mariners, sixth 
round), junior right-hander Bryan 
Pall (Mariners, 25th round) and 
senior centerfielder Johnny Slater 
(Mariners, 28th round):

The News Tribune in Tacoma, 

Wash. reported last Sunday that the 
Mariners had agreed to terms with 
26 of their 40 draft picks, including 
all three Wolverines. As Michigan’s 
No. 1 starter, Jaskie went 8-3 with a 
3.77 earned-run average while tying 
a school record with 119 strikeouts, 
and Slater hit .299 with five home 
runs and 47 RBIs in a breakout 
senior season. Pall missed most of 
the 2017 season due to injury, but 
recorded seven saves and a 3.18 ERA 
in his college career.

Junior third baseman/catcher 

Drew Lugbauer (Atlanta Braves, 

11th round):

Lugbauer 
had 
been 
drafted 

out of high school in Arlington, 
N.Y. — by the Toronto Blue Jays 
in the 21st round — but elected to 
attend Michigan instead. This time, 
however, he signed with the Braves 
after a junior season in which he hit 
.290 with 11 home runs and slugged 
.518.

“It’s a dream come true,” Lugbauer 

told the Poughkeepsie Journal. “This 
is something you’ve fantasized about 
since you were a little kid, and now 
you’re seeing it start to become real.”

Junior right-hander Ryan Nutof 

(Cincinnati Reds, 16th round):

Nutof told the Elgin Courier-News 

in his hometown of South Elgin, Ill. 
that he planned to visit the Reds’ 
Goodyear, Ariz. training facility 
and sign with the organization 
while there. In his final season as a 
Wolverine, Nutof was 6-2 with a 4.27 
ERA.

Junior 
first 
baseman 
Jake 

Bivens 
(Detroit 
Tigers, 
27th 

round):

Bivens officially signed with the 

Tigers organization last week. The 
Big Ten Freshman of the Year in 
2015, he hit .273 with a .436 on-base 
percentage this season, and finished 
his Michigan career with a .318 
batting average and 46 stolen bases.

“I just talked it over with my family 

and decided this is the right decision 
for me and my baseball career,” 
Bivens told the Battle Creek Enquirer.

Senior 
catcher 
Harrison 

Wenson (Los Angeles Angels, 
24th 
round), 
senior 
right-

hander Mac Lozer (New York 
Mets, 33rd round) and senior 
shortstop Michael Brdar (St. Louis 
Cardinals, 36th round):

Wenson and Brdar have both 

signed 
with 
their 
respective 

teams. Wenson was a focal point 
of Michigan’s success on defense 
this season and helped guide the 
Wolverines’ pitching staff to a 3.46 
ERA as a team, which ranked 18th 
in the country. He struggled to make 
contact at the plate, hitting just .191, 
but provided power with nine home 
runs. Brdar contributed in every 
facet of the game this season, with 
a .310 average, 37 RBIs, 19 stolen 
bases and a .988 fielding percentage 
at shortstop.

Lozer, who compiled a 1.00 ERA 

and averaged almost 1.4 strikeouts 
per inning as a senior, has not signed 
yet, but intends to do so.

Junior 
left-hander 
Michael 

Hendrickson (Cleveland Indians, 
28th 
round) 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore 
left-hander 
Grant 

Reuss 
(Detroit 
Tigers, 
29th 

round):

The two left-handers are the 

only two who have yet to decide 
whether 
they 
will 
return 
to 

Michigan or turn professional. 
Hendrickson broke out as part 
of the Wolverines’ rotation this 
season, posting a 6-3 record and 
4.06 ERA while holding opponents 
to a .236 average. Reuss struck 
out 11 batters in six innings in his 
redshirt sophomore season.

How do these decisions impact 

Michigan’s outlook for 2018?

With the departures of Bivens and 

Lugbauer made official as well as that 
of Brdar, the Wolverines’ defensive 
infield — one of the best units in the 
nation this season — is now down 
to only one returning starter — 
sophomore second baseman Ako 
Thomas. Sophomore Jimmy Kerr, who 
filled in for Thomas after he suffered 
an injury against Indiana, has shown 
the ability to play all across the infield, 
and likely will have a permanent role 
in 2018. Redshirt freshman Joe Pace 
and freshman Dominic Clementi 
should see expanded roles as well, and 
sophomore Nick Poirier, who spent 
most of the season as the designated 
hitter, is also capable of playing third 
base. But replacing three-fourths of 
Michigan’s defensive bedrock won’t 
be an easy task.

Neither will it be easy to rebuild 

the Wolverines’ starting rotation, 
which will be without a proven 
ace for the first time since 2014. 
Hendrickson, if he returns, and 
junior right-hander Alec Rennard 
were both capable last season, 
and it’s possible that soon-to-be 
sophomores Karl Kauffman and 
Tommy Henry, both of whom 
showed flashes of their immense 
potential out of the bullpen last 
season, could claim starting spots as 
well. Henry recorded a 3.18 ERA and 
struck out 39 batters in 31 innings 
last season, while Kauffman had an 
ERA of 2.08 in 10 innings. 

Overall, this will be a very 

different team next season, at least 
relative to the limited turnover 
between the 2016 and 2017 squads, 
where Michigan returned seven 
regular starters. Another factor 
to keep an eye on is the role of the 
Wolverines’ 
incoming 
freshman 

class, which is again ranked as 
the best class in the Big Ten. Last 
season’s freshman found it hard to 
obtain regular playing time on such 
an experienced team, with Henry 
being the main exception. But with a 
wide-open infield and pitching staff, 
that may not be the case this season.
