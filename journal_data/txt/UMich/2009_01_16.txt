Mich. leaders push for funds

NAACP chair, 'Daily
Show' personality to
speak for symposium
By ELIN BERGMAN
Daily StaffReporter
In an effort to reach a wide audi-
ence, this year's Martin Luther
King Jr. symposium will feature
speakers that include NAACP
Chairman Julian Bond and Larry
Wilmore from "The Daily Show
with Jon Stewart."
Bond will deliver the keynote
speech Monday morning at Hill
Auditorium.
Theda Gibbs, coordinator for the
MLK symposium planning com-
mittee, said Bond was invited to
speak because of his long-standing
commitment to civil rights. Bond,
who was a member of the Geor-
gia General Assemhly for over 20
years, has heen chair of the NAACP
since 1998.
"We think about current events,
and we think of a person whose
life and work have been creating
positive change in our community,"
Gibbs said of the selection process.
Gibbs said Bond will address a
variety of topics including what
changes to expect when Barack
Obama becomes president.
"I'm sure he'll forecast what will
happenwhen (Obama) takes office,"
she said.
In addition to Bond, Larry
Wilmore, the so-called "Senior
Black Correspondent" from "The
Daily Show," will be speaking as
part of the symposium.

Though best known for his role
on the Comedy Central staple,
Wilmore has also written for tele-
vision series "The Fresh Prince
of Bel-Air" and "The Jamie Foxx
Show."
Helen Look, chair of the Univer-
sity Library MLK Day committee,
said it chose Wilmore because of
his ability to connect to students.
"We really wanted to reach out
to the student population," Look
said. "We felt like we wanted to do
something that would really appeal
to students. I think'that the whole
idea of the campus symposium is to
look at different aspects of what the
theme is.

Granholm, Levin
say bailout money
would help diversify
Michigan economy
By BENJAMIN S. CHASE
Daily StaffReporter
With almost every sector of
the state's economy faltering and
unemployment soaring far above
national levels, Michigan lawmak-
ers say that the proposed federal
economic stimulus package cannot

be enacted quickly enough.
The federal economic stimulus
package proposed by Democrats in
the U.S. House of Representatives
and the incoming Obama adminis-
tration will combine tax cuts with
large-scale government spending.
The plan has a total price tag of
$825 billion.
The stimulus, which appears
likely to pass in both the House
and Senate, will include projects
overseen by the federal govern-
ment, and large amounts of aid
given directly to states based on
their specific needs.
"The American Recovery and

Reinvestment Plan" of 2009 was
introduced as a bill in the House
yesterday. A Senate version of the
bill has yet to be drafted and pro-
posed.
In interviews and state-
ments this week, Sen. Carl Levin
(D-Mich.) and Gov. Jennifer Gra-
nholm (D-Mich.) revealed some
details of their planned pitches for
bailout funds.
At the state level, Granholm is
dealing with an economic crisis
not seen in decades. She said in
an e-mail interview this.week that
she plans to work to create jobs as
quickly as possible across all sec-

tors of the economy, using funding
from the stimulus package to facil-
itate work on ready-to-go projects
statewide.
"In Michigan, this package will
allow us to create jobs today, create
jobs and an economy for tomorrow
and prevent the state from making
cuts that will make the economy
worse by hurting people," she said.
She also said that she expects
the package to create jobs in con-
struction, health care and infor-
mation technology sectors.
Though unable to provide spe-
cifics about the just how much
See STIMULUS, Page 7

Look said she expects Wilmore's
speech, called "Don't Take Diver-
sity Seriously: Just Kidding!" to be
an "honest discussion" of race rela-
tions in the United States.
"He knouts how to bring in
humor in things," she said. "He's
going to be talking about the elec-
tion, the upcoming presidential
inauguration, any of the current
news events."
Gibbs said the timing of the sym-
posium with the historical inaugu-
ration of the first black president
will affect the atmosphere.
"I think people will be excited,"

CAMPUS FLOOD
Water main breaks,
bus routes altered

100 attend rally for Israeli cause

Water gushed down
Murfin Avenue,
causing buses to
take detours
By JILLIAN BERMAN
Daily News Editor
Yesterday morning, a water
main on Murfin Avenue between
Hubbard Street and Duffield
Drive burst, shutting down traffic
for a block and forcing detours for
many University bus routes.
Bitsy Lamb, a manager for Park-
ing and Transportation Services,
said she expects that bus service
will be affected at least through
the rest of today.
Lamb said that though most
buses will be making detours and
some bus routes won't be run-
ning at all, students shouldn't be
concerned because buses will still
service all stops.
"We're not missing any stops,
we're covering them with some-
thing," she said. "There is some
coverage. There is just not what
(students) are expecting so they
just have to re-group."

Lamb said the Bursley-Baits
bus route, which rusps from Cen-
tral Campus to Bursley Hall, will
take a detour on Plymouth Road
to avoid the shut-down block. The
Northwood Express route, which
runs between Northwood Hous-
ing and Central Campus, won't
be running at all. Instead, those
buses will run on the Diag-to-
Diag route, which takes students
between the North Campus and
Central Campus Diags.
Lamb said students should
expect delays, especially during
rush hour.
"We will be probably pretty
negatively affected at rush hour
time on Maiden Lane," she said.
"It's very congested, it's a one lane
in, one lane out. It's pretty ugly at
rush hour, and we're just going to
make it worse."
Engineering graduate student
Yi Qing Qu felt the effects of the
slow down yesterday while he was
waiting at the C.C. Little bus stop.
Qu said he was originally planning
to go to Pierpont Commons, but
was surprised when thebus driver
announced that there was goingto
be a detour.
"They dropped us off near Glen

Students defend
Israel's military
advances into Gaza
By AMY MUNSLOW
Daily StaffReporter
About 100 people gathered in
front of the Hatcher Graduate
Library last night to participate in
a rally to support Israel.
The event, held last night by
Israel Initiating Dialogue, Edu-
cation, and Advocacy (IDEA),
was in defense of Israel's military
advances in Gaza over the past 20
days. IDEA's chair, Ben Kaminsky,
said in an interview before the
rally that the purpose was to show

support for the country of Israel.
Students read the names of
Israeli soldiers killed in the con-
flict as well as prayers for Israel.
"We hope to show Israel that
America stands united behind
Israel's actions and their right to
defend themselves," he said.
The participants were mainly
University students holding Israe-
li flags and signs. Rally-goers also
wore buttons, which read, "Sup-
port Israel, Support Peace."
Ari Parritz, president of the
Interfraternity Council, gave a
speech defending the military
advances of Israel and urging
American citizens to stand behind
its actions. As of last night, The
Associated Press reported that

RESEARCH AT THE 'U'
'U' prof. helps develop artificial bone marrow

7-year project leads
to new instrument
for medical research
By AMY MUNSLOW
Daily StaffReporter
A collaborative effort between
researchers at the University of
Texas Medical Branch and the Uni-

versity of Michigan was the first
to successfully produce functional
artificial bone marrow, paving the
way for future research on human
reactions to new drugs.
The venture - a joint effort
between a University of Michigan
biomedical engineering professor
and two researchers from the Uni-
versity of Texas Medical Branch -
took seven years to complete and
was funded by Defense Advanced

Research Projects Agency.
The project is currently being
used as a model to test the human
immune system's response to new
drugs.
Joan Nichols, one of the UTMB
researchers, said the artificial bone
marrow system is a step forward
for drug testingbecause it provides
a far more accurate response than
tests on bone marrow from mice or
rats. She added that further possi-

bilities for potentialuses of the arti-
ficial bone marrow are endless.
"It willhelp scientiststhat design
vaccines to treat infections or envi-
ronmental exposure to chemicals
that cause leukemiaor other diseas-
es," Nichols said. "It could even be
used to test the immune response
to cosmetics or foods."
For the project, Kotov created a
matrix that mimics the tissues that

NEWS BRIEFS
CABIMAS, Venezuela
Venezuela seeks
Big Oil investments
Squeezed by slumping crude
prices, Venezuela is reaching out
to the multinational oil compa-
nies it once demonized as imperi-
alist profiteers.
Venezuela is soliciting bids
from the world's major oil compa-
nies to extract heavy crude from
vast deposits in its Orinoco River
region. Despite President Hugo
Chavez's criticism of U.S.-style
capitalism, it has become clear
that state-owned Petroleos de
Venezuela SA needs both the cash
and expertise of Big Oil.
These international oil com-
panies have made windfall prof-
its in recent years, but analysts
doubt many will want to invest
again given Chavez's history of
seizing foreign stakes in Venezu-
ela's oil.
"When it comes to Venezuela,
there's still going to be a lot of skep-
ticism," said Greg Priddy, a global
oil analyst at the Eurasia Group in
Washington D.C. "Chavez is still
there and you haven't had a change
in government."
MOSCOW
Economic crisis
pressures Russia's
ruling tandem
Russia's President Dmitry
Medvedev has twice rebuked the
government led by his predeces-
sor Vladimir Putin in the past
couple of weeks, raising ques-
tions of whether a rift is develop-
ing between the powerful former
Kremlin leader and the man he
chose to replace him.
On both occasions, Medvedev
criticized the government for not
doing enough to help industry
and business cope with the global
financial crisis, which has hit Rus-
sia hard.
"The planned measures are
being fulfilled slower than we
counted on and, most important,
slower than the current situation
demands," Medvedev said during
a visit Sunday to an engine plant
outside Moscow with government
ministers.
Two weeks earlier, Medvedev
characterized the government's
anti-crisis program as "well-bal-
anced but not ideal."
TOLEDO, OsO
e Cousins plead
guilty in Ohio
terrorism case
Two cousins from the Chicago
. area have pleaded guilty in Ohio to
taking part in a plot to recruit and
train terrorists to kill American
soldiers.
Federal prosecutors say the
men had been training and plan-
ning to go overseas so that they
could kill U.S. soldiers in Iraq or
Afghanistan.
Authorities say the men were
recruited by three Toledo men
organizing the plot. All three were
convicted last summer and are

awaiting sentencing.
Khaleel Ahmed of Chicago and
Zubair Ahmed of suburban Chica-
go both pleaded guilty Thursday
in U.S. District Court to conspir-
acy to provide material support to
terrorists.
Each faces a maximum of 15
years in prison.
WASHINGTON
U.S. inks nuclear
* deal with Gulf ally
The Bush administration signed
a nuclear cooperation agreement
on Thursday with the United Arab
Emirates - a last-minute deal
saddling the incoming Obama
administration with a decision on
helping a Persian Gulf ally develop
nuclear power despite concerns in
Congress.
The deal sets the legal ground-
work for U.S. commercial nuclear
trade with the UAE, which has
foresworn nuclear arms as asigna-
tory to the Nuclear Nonprolifera-
tion Treaty.
Despite the emirates' status as
a key U.S. partner in the Mideast,
some in Congress say the UAE has
W done too little to Help stein the
illicit flow of nuclear supplies to
its Gulf neighbor and commercial
partner Iran.
While the deal was forged by
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice in one of her final acts of
1 diplomacy, it will be the Obama
administration that will have to
decide whether the agreement is
sent to Congress.

shell UN office
in Gaza City

An Airbus 320 US Airways aircraft that went down in the Hudson River in New York yesterday. There were 155 people n
board. No one was injured.
P ilot ditches plareinto
frigid river; all survive

Bird collisions
suspected as cause
of the crash
NEW YORK (AP) - With both
engines out, a cool-headed pilot
maneuvered his crowded jetliner
over New York City and ditched
it in the frigid Hudson River on
Thursday, and all 155 on board were
pulled to safety as the plane slowly
sank. It was, the governor said, "a
miracle on the Hudson."
One victim suffered two broken
legs, a paramedic said, but there
were no other reports of serious
injuries.
The plane, a US Airways Airbus
A320 bound for Charlotte, N.C.,
struck a flock of birds during take-
off minutes earlier at LaGuardia
Airport and was submerged up to
its windows in the river by the time
rescuers arrived in Coast Guard
vessels and ferries. Some passen-
gers waded in water up to their
knees, standing on the wing of the
plane and waiting for help.
"He was phenomenal," passen-
ger Joe Hart said. "He landed it - I
tell you what - the impact wasn't
a whole lot more than a rear-end
(collision). It threw you into the
seat ahead of you.
"Both engines cut out and he
actually floated it into the river,"
he added.
In a city still wounded from the
aerial attack on the World Trade
Center, authorities were quick to
assure the public that terrorism
wasn't involved.
Police divers had to rescue some

of the passengers from underwater,
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.
Among those on board was one
infant who appeared to be fine, the
mayor said.
Helen Rodriguez, a paramedic
who was among the first to arrive
at the scene, said she saw one
woman with two broken legs. Fire
officials said others were evaluated
for hypothermia, bruises and other
minor injuries. a
"We had a miracle on 34th
Street. I believe now we have had
a miracle on the Hudson," Gov.
David Paterson said.
The crash took place on a
20-degree day, one of the coldest of
the season in New York. The water
temperature was 36 degrees, Coast
Guard Lt. Commander Moore said.
He estimates that hypothermia can
hit within five to eight minutes at
that temperature.
"The captain said, 'Brace for
impact because we're going down,"'
passenger Jeff Kolodjay said. He
said passengers put their heads in
their laps and started praying. He
said the plane hit the water pretty
hard, but he was fine.
"It was intense. It was intense.
You've got to give it to .the pilot.
He made a hell of a landing,"
Kolodjay said.
Another passenger, Fred Ber-
retta, who was on his way home to
Charlotte from a business trip, told
CNN doors were opened on both
sides of the plane "as soon as we hit
the water."
Witnesses said the plane's pilot
appeared to guide the plane down.
Bob Read, a television producer
who saw the crash from his office

window, said it appeared to be a
"controlled descent."
Paramedics treated at least 78
patients, fire officials said. Coast
Guard boats rescued 35 people who
were immersed in the frigid water
and ferried them to shore. Some
of the rescued were shivering and
wrapped in white blankets, their
feet and legs soaked.
One commuter ferry, the Thom-
as Jefferson of the company NY
Waterway, arrived within minutes
of the crash, and some of its own
riders grabbed life vests and lines
of rope and tossed them to plane
passengers in the water.
"They were cheering when
we pulled up," ferry captain Vin-
cent Lombardi. "We had to pull
an elderly woman out of a raft in
a sling. She was crying. ... People
were panicking. They said, 'hurry
up, hurry up."'
Two police scuba divers said they
pulled another woman from a life-
boat "frightened out of her mind"
and lethargic from hypothermia.
Another woman fell off a rescue raft,
and the divers said they swam over
and put her on a Coast Guard boat.
US Airways Flight 1549 took off
at 3:26 p.m. It was less than a min-
ute later when the pilot reported
a "double bird strike" and said he
needed to return to LaGuardia,
said Doug Church, a spokesman for
the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association. He said the controller
told the pilot to divert to an airport
in nearby Teterboro, N.J.
Itwas notclear why the pilot did
not land at Teterboro. Church said
there was no mayday call from the
plane's transponder.

Compound
sheltered more than
700 civilians
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -
Israeli artillery shells struck the
U.N. headquarters in the Gaza
Strip on yesterday, setting a food
warehouse-ablaze and drawing a
sharp rebuke fromthe visiting U.N.
chief who called it an "outrage."
Another Israeli bombardment
killed Hamas' head of security.
The attack added to a day of
deadly chaos pitting Israeli troops
against Islamic militants. Terrified
residents huddled in shelters and
stairwells, or scooped up toddlers
and fled on foot.
After nightfall, shells landed
near Gaza City's Quds Hospital,
where many families had sought
refuge, and the building caught
fire, forcing staff to evacuate
hundreds of people. According to
a hospital medic, some patients
were pushed down the street on
gurneys; a few held white flags.
The destruction added to what
aid groups say is a'humanitarian
crisis in Gaza and -ratcheted up
tensions between Israel and the
international community even as
diplomats indicated progress in
cease-fire talks.
Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi
Livni was departing last night
for Washington to discuss a Gaza
cease-fire with Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice. The United
States and Egypt have been work-
ing to forge an agreement to end 20
days of bitter fighting.
The U.N. compound, made up
of workshops and warehouses as
well as offices, was struck about
a half-dozen times over a roughly
two-hour period while more than
700 civilians were sheltering
there, said John Ging, head of Gaza
operations for the U.N. Relief and
Works Agency.
The civilians were huddling in
the compound's vocational train-
ing center when it was struck by
a tank round or an artillery shell,
causing the three injuries, Ging
said. Throughout this time, he
said, U.N. officials were frantically
contacting Israeli officials to urge
an end to the firing on the U.N.
compound.
The attack triggered a raging
fire that engulfed a warehouse and
destroyed thousands of pounds
of food and other aid intended
for Gaza's beleaguered citizens.
Workers with fire extinguishers
and Palestinian firefighters, some
wearing bulletproof jackets, strug-
gled to douse flames and tugged

bags of flour from the debris.
Fuel supplies and cars in a
garage also went up in flames.
Ging said the contacts with
Israeli officials were made under
a new liaison system aimed at pre-
venting any attack similar to the
shelling at a U.N. school in north-
ern Gaza earlier this month that
killed about 40 people. At the time,
Israel said militants had fired on
army positions from the area.
AnIsraeliairstrike killed Interi-
or Minister Said Siam, a key figure
in Hamas who oversaw thousands
of security agents, Hamas TV said.
A top aide, Siam's brother and his
brother's family also were killed.
"We are talking about a key per-
son in terms of logistics in the field,
and also in the political sense," said
Bassem Zbeidy, a Hamas expert in
the West Bank.
He said Siam's deathwas a"huge
loss for Hamas," but noted that the
movement is easily capable of gen-
erating new leaders, often more
radical than their predecessors.
Israel's intense assaults Thurs-
day seemed to reflect an extra
push to pressure Hamas negotia-
tors into making concessions on a
cease-fire and punish the militant
group as much as possible before
any end to hostilities.
Israeli envoy Amos Gilad
returned from Cairo, where he dis-
cussed a cease-fire proposal with
Egyptian officials who are also
trying to coax Hamas into ending
the war
Israel launched the offensive
Dec. 27 to end Hamas rocket
attacks on Israel. Gaza medics say
about 1,100 Palestinians, half of
them civilians, have died; 13 Israe-
lis have also been killed.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-
moon, visiting Israel, said Israeli
Defense Minister Ehud Barak told
him the attack on the U.N. com-
pound was a "grave" error and
apologized for it.
"I conveyed my strong protest
and outrageto the defensepainister
and foreign minister and"demanded
a full explanation," said Ban, who
arrived Thursday from Egypt.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert said the military fired artil-
lery shells at the U.N. compound
after Hamas militants opened fire
from the location. Three people
were wounded.
"It is absolutely true that we
were attacked from that place, but
the consequences are very sad and
we apologize for it," he said.
Israel's chief military spokes-
man, Brig. Gen. Avi Benayahu, said
the military had not clarified the
incident and that an investigation
was under way.

Congress clears way for
$825-billion bailout package

Speaker promises
to have bill ready in
February
WASHINGTON (AP) - Con-
gress laid the foundation for
President-elect Barack Obama's
economic recovery plan on Thurs-
day with remarkable speed, clear-
ing the way for a new infusion
of bailout cash for the financial
industry while majority Demo-
crats proposed spending increases
and tax cuts totaling a whopping
$825 billion.
Two days after Obama person-
ally lobbied for release of $350
billion in bailout funds, the Sen-
ate narrowly turned aside a bid to
block the money.
Across the Capitol, Speak-
er Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. said,
"Immediate job creation and then
continuing job creation" were the
twin goals of the separate stimu-
lus legislation. It recommends tax
cuts for businesses and individuals
while pouring billions into areas
such as health care, education,
energy and highway construction.
She and Senate Majority Leader
Harry Reid, D-Nev., have pledged
to have the economic stimulus bill
ready for Obama's signature by
mid-February.
Both houses debated Obama's
call to release another $350 billion

from the financial bailout pack-
age, but the Senate vote was the
triumph he had sought. Despite
bipartisan anger over the Bush
administration's handling of the
program to date, Democratic allies
of the incoming president pre-
vailed on a 52-42 roll call.
The vote followed a commit-
ment by Obama to use as much as
$100 billion of the funds to help
homeowners facing foreclosure
proceedings.
The money will be available
in less than two weeks, at a time
when there is fresh evidence of
shakiness among banks.
The 44th president-to-be was
at his transition office across town
from the Capitol - and President
Bush relegated to the role of virtu-
al onlooker - as events played out
at the dawn of a new Democratic
era in government.
Obama has called for swift and
bold action to confront an eco-
nomic debacle unrivaled since the
Great Depression.
The president-elect, who travels
to hardhit Ohio on Friday to pro-
mote his economic program, also
announced he would convene a
"fiscal responsibility summit" in
February to focus on long-term
problems with the economy and
the skyrocketing costs of benefit
programs such as Social Security
and Medicare. "We've kicked this
can down the road and now we are

at the end of the road," he said in a
Washington Post interview posted
on the newspaper's Web site.
In remarks on the Senate floor,
Reid called the vote a victory for
Obama, whom he said exhibited
courage by seeking release of the
money. "This was a test of leader-
ship at a time when leadership is
desperately needed," he said.
Obama said in a statement he
was gratified with the result,
adding, "I know this wasn't an
easy vote because of the frustra-
tion so many of us share about
how the first half of this plan was
implemented."
Earlier, he hailed the stimulus
blueprint as "a significant down-
payment on our most urgent
challenges."
The outlines of the economic
stimulus measure reflected a
change in political priorities, with
an emphasis on spending and tax
breaks designed to encourage
production of alternative energy
sources, make federal buildings
more energy- efficient and weath-
erize homes.
At the same time, more tradi-
tional anti-recession spending was
built in. There was more than $130
billion for health care, much of it
to help states cope with the rising
demand for Medicaid, the health
care program for the low-income
and a recession-era refuge for the
newly laid-off.

Crossing city boundaries
Pedestrian walkway is an unnecessary infringement
T he University seems to have grown concerned that its stu-
dents might be having trouble crossing the street. This is
demonstrated by a request that the University filed last
Sunday asking the city to vacate Monroe Street in order to allow
space for a pedestrian mall. The mall would connect the Law Quad
to its new extension across the street. While the University thinks
the added walking space is necessary, it has forgotten to take into
account the negative effects the proposed plan would have on the
University's increasingly strained relationship with the city. Caus-
ing further harm to this relationship is a bad idea, and at least for
the time being, the University should table this unnecessary plan.

Rallying the B. S.E.'s

The proposed pedestrian mall would
complement the 100,000-square-foot
extension to the Law Quad. The addition,
which will replace the parking lot that now
faces Weill Hall across Monroe Street, will
be built along the same architectural style
as the Law Quad. In an effort to allow safer
access to the building 'and create "conti-
nuity" between the original complex and
the new building, the University hopes to
assume control of Monroe Street from the
city and convert it into a pedestrian walk-
way. But what the University doesn't seem
to realize is that the pedestrian mall will
also have other, more negative effects.
Relations between the University and
the city have sometimes been tense,
because the University, within its consti-
tutional autonomy, doesn't have to listen
much to the city. Most recently, the Uni-
versity failed to consult with the city as
closely as it should have as it prepares to
purchase the former Pfizer Inc. facility
near north campus. While this deal will fill
an empty property, the University won't
be paying property taxes, which will put
the city out a staggering $5.1 million in tax
revenue. In the wake of that financial blow,
it's especially important to show respect
for city property. The University's plans
for the pedestrian mall would require the
city to vacate Monroe Street, and while the
city has not yet reacted negatively, such
a demand could worsen a newly strained

relationship.
Maintaining a strong relationship with
the city of Ann Arbor is essential for the
University. One of the reasons students
and faculty are attracted to this campus
is because it is integrated into a city that,
for the most part, maintains well-run ser-
vices, a respect for citizens' concerns and
an atmosphere unlike almost any other in
this state. That atmosphere can't be con-
tinued unless the University and the city
work together - even when the University
doesn't have to.
This is not an issue worth straining rela-
tions over. Turning Monroe Street into a
pedestrian mall isn't necessary for main-
taining walkability near the Law Quad.
It's hard to imagine that crossing Monroe
Street on foot is any more difficult than
crossing other roads on campus. A better
solution would be to put in a marked cross-
walk similar to the one that allows students
to cross State Street between Angell Hall
and the LSA Building. There is no need
to bar vehicles from Monroe Street when
a simple crosswalk would accomplish the
same task.
And aside from the fact that the Univer-
sity needs to stop bullying the city, it just
isn't that difficult to cross Monroe Street.
Law students may be caught up in briefs
and case studies, but they haven't forgot-
ten to look both ways before they barge
into oncoming traffic.

Engineers get a bad rap on cen-
tral campus. Some of us lib-
eral arts majors claim they're
overly arrogant,
while others might
mention a lack of
sociability or even
a disregard for con-
temporary style.
I'm just as guilty
of saying this as
everyoneelse.Some
of the accusations NEIL
may be deserved -T
an "L, S and Play" TAMBE
degree really isn't
that easy compared
to your engineering degree despite
what you may think - but I think
engineers are incredibly important
and catch more flak than they deserve.
I'm nearly convinced that if someone
saves the world during our lifetime, it
will be an engineer.
Global issues like climate change,
the spreading of disease, malnour-
ishment, healthcare and information
management are greatly impacted by
engineering and the sciences. Engi-
neers are making cars more efficient,
figuring out how to build bridges and
howto develop the next revolutionary
materials. Engineers make things like
space exploration, prosthetic limbs
and personal computing possible.
Engineering students - to say
nothing of the incredible research
that engineering faculty perform
- are doing ridiculously awesome
things on campus. They are build-
ing innovative solar and hybrid cars,
human-powered helicopters and con-
crete canoes.With the help of the Uni-
versity's Center for Entrepreneurship
and the student group MPowered
Entrepreneurship, engineering stu-
dents are forming teams with people

from other disciplines like Informa-
tion or Business to start new ventures
that may ultimately impact the state
of Michigan, the United States and
the world.
Social, political and management
problems like racism and terrorism
matter, too. But there's something
fundamental about problems that
engineers tackle because without
adequate food, water, shelter and
energy, it's game over for humanity.
Without the physical world around
us functioning properly, it seems
unlikely that social problems would
be our most pressing need. It's not a
stretch to use the expression "lights
out" if engineers fail to solve these
gripping problems.
The ability to profit from innovation
is obvious. But it's too narrow-minded
to think that profitability is the only
reason to develop new technologies.
Engineers have a civic duty to advance
the public good because some societal
problems certainly cannot be solved
without their attention.
But while they have the potential
to encourage great social change,
engineers may not be aware of their
responsibility to do so. And, if they
are, can they be expected to live up
to such an obligation? I've spoken
to more than a few engineers in the
past few weeks about the possibility
that they might save the world, and I
always get one of two responses. The
first is a wave of humility. Engineers
always point out that engineering
doesn't matter on its own. They seem
to be quite aware of the symbiotic
relationship that engineers need with
the rest of the professional world to
solve problems.
They mention that it takes politi-
cal support from the political types
and the inspiration to do good from

the social justice and environmental
types. Engineering students, as much
as they publicly snub their noses at
the students of liberal arts disciplines,
appreciate the contribution that an
English literature, anthropology or
economics major can make when
solving problems.
Will engineers
beableto save
the world?
The second response is a feeling of
uncertainty. Do engineers believe they
can save the world? I'm not so sure.
Some that I've gotten to know might
evenbereluctantto acceptthisrespon-
sibility. Speaking to a few engineers at
a luncheon last week, an engineer sit-
ting near me mentioned that it's diffi-
cult to maintain a worldly perspective
as an engineer because the disciplines
in engineering are distinct and well-
defined. But engineers, you have to
believe. So do the rest of us.
Whether or not engineers save the
world, I think the work that they do
is vital to our advancement as a soci-
ety. We need everything from cleaner 4
power to rehabilitative medicines and
super-nifty computers, and engineers
create those technologies. So even
though a diversity of knowledge and
training really helps in problem-solv-
ing, engineers have a special place
in my heart. If you see an engineer
today, I dare you to give them a high-
five. Rally the B.S.E's.

had for so long. YOUNG
I want to live in
New York. It's cli-
che, but in a way
that seems like a euphemism for "that
city will eat you alive."
No, I didn't invent the genre: pin-
ing-for-the-city stories have been
told before. Hell, with 95 percent of
the world's population on 10 percent
of its land, nearly all of us have a story
like that. But at their core, those sto-
ries are all about beating the odds.
They're about getting the 'big break'
or surviving on a shoestring. It led me
to wonder if people from small cities
like Ann Arbor have what it takes.
Growing up here, I thought I'd
turned out a little green. Ann Arbor
is a poor boot camp for big city living.
It's the kind of place where you can
get your wallet returned to you. You
can treat bookstores and coffee shops
like your own living room. No one
will wake you if you fall asleep on a
couch. Strangers almost always wel-
come spontaneous conversation. It's
a friendly old college town we live in.
But in other ways, this Michigan
town doesgive you an accurate

taste of th'e big-city. To start with, the
rent here is ridiculously expensive.
We have good food - you can find
great Thai, Indian, Korean, Jamaican
and Middle Eastern food on the cheap.
There's a bit of nightlife and too much
shopping. The art, films and music on
the weekends are just enough. But I
wanted to get to the big leagues.
I realized that there was a differ-
ence between laying plans and lying
to myself. I needed to know howI felt
in the thick of it. After New Years, I
flew to New York - mostly to see how
it fit and how adequately Ann Arbor
had prepared me.
It happened in the East Village.
Walking out of a dizzying bookshop
and into the street, I passed the
crowded cafes. Forty-second Street
looked to me like a moonscape, like I
didn'tbelong there. I opened the door
to a 24-hour Ukrainian restaurant,
and I had to hurry to grab a bar stool.
And maybe it was this brief reminder
of Ann Arbor, but suddenly, my confi-
dence was re-lit.
Too many people will tell you that
New York is dangerous. Okay, sure.
Don't take it from me: I am Midwest-
ern and as street-smart as the bulldog
in Homeward Bound. But there were
people on the streets and subways
late into the night, so you're always in
good company. The place has changed
since the 1970s and 80s (and no, it's
.not all thanks to Giuliani). I had cause
to feel like a sitting duck, schlepping
my rolling suitcase all over Queens,
Harlem and Manhattan. But most
everyone is too busy with their own
lives to notice.
Every neighborhood had its own
character to explore. After one day,

After East Village, I treated it a bit
more like home and relaxed there.
We enjoyed the little things, the sub-
ways and people there, as much as
our strolls. In Brooklyn Beach, Little
Italy and Chinatown we had no idea
where we were going, and got the
most out of figuring it out. The best
things I've seen here weren't even in
my guidebook. It seems to me that
the pleasure of living in New York is
always stumbling on some gem that
shakes up your daily routine.
Six months ago, I was so anxious
about my future and my plans. But
what I know now is that Ann Arbor
prepared me for New York in ways
I'd never even realized. It may not be
where I want to stay, but thanks to
this little town, I know where I want
my big-city dreams to carry me.

my friend and I began to grasp how

once in their lives and have to care-

major museums, shows, and iconic
sights. People wait in the cold for
hours to try to see what New York has
to offer. They shell out for taxis and 4

cinema. As the awards season hits

this little movie with a big heart is

film begins with a brutal inter-

Give Frank Miller credit for sticking to what he knows. The comic
book artist-turned-filmmaker has taken on his first solo directorial
effort after co-directing "Sin City," and, as he did with that excel-
lent film, he has pulled out every trick in the book to make "The
Spirit" look like a living, breathing, 1940s comic. Problem is, most of
his techniques - stylized black-and-white photography with brief
glimpses of color and excessive green screen use - already feel like
old hat in only their second appearance. Once the thrill of the visual
effects quickly wears off, it becomes all too obvious that Miller still
lacks the ability to tell a compelling story.
The relatively standard plot, featuring a former cop (Gabriel
Macht, "The Good Shepherd") who becomes immortal and swears to
protect his city from its criminal underbelly, doesn't develop nearly
O enough to become engaging. Bizarrely, Miller seems to have run his
own script through a copy machine before handing it to his actors,
who often recite the same lines of hokey dialogue three or four times
in a row ("I can't stand eggs!"). Samuel L. Jackson, as gun-toting
wild man The Octopus, once again proves to be the best part of a
mediocre movie. Somebody make sure he's part of the cast for the
upcoming "Sin City 2," because if "The Spirit" is any indication, that
film won't have a chance of surviving on looks alone.

Film Review
Aniston and Wilson should have viewers
wagging their tails with Marley'
"Marley & Me"
20th Century Fox
At Showcase and Quality 16
"Marley & Me," based on The New York Times bestseller memoir
by John Grogan, tells a simple tale: Man meets dog; hijinks ensue.
The film depicts the life of Grogan (Owen Wilson, "The Darjeeling
Limited") and his wife Jennifer (Jennifer Aniston, "The Break-Up")
along with their unruly pup Marley, dubbed by his owners as the
"World's Worst Dog."
As straightforward as the plot seems, "Marley & Me" actually
extends beyond what audiences would expect: It's a dramedy that
features legitimately funny gags in addition to its good-looking
leads. The good-natured tale is littered with realistic themes, exem-
plified as Grogan navigates marital stresses and the ups and downs
of his career as a journalist.
Audiences may prefer the wisecracking Wilson, but his perfor-
mance in the subdued moments of the film is just as engaging. Even
more endearing is Aniston, who's more likable on screen than she's
been in years. Playing the universal Everywoman, she manages to be
more than a straight-faced comic foil to a meddling dog.
"Marley & Me" is hardly a progressive film, but the story is warm-
hearted and lively, much like the dog it follows.

contains just at 9 p.m.
another one of ABC
GrandmaMillie's
lumpy sweaters
with a cat on it.
The excitement generated by
,season seven dissipated quick-
ly as the show moved in a new
direction that was simply unnat-
ural and out of place; almost out
of the blue, childlike protagonist
J.D. (Zach Braff, "Garden State")
fathered a child. Unfortunately,
J.D. isn't the father type - never
has been, probably never will be.
The season also suffered from
frustrating plot problemis chat cul-
ininated in a tremendiiusly disap-
pointing ending. "Scrubs" fans
should've revolted against the fina-
le after J.D. and Eliot (Sara Chalke,
"Mama's Boy") decided to be just
friends - probably the worst idea
in TV history after Brody Jenner's
reality show.
Undeniably, "Scrubs" is dete-
riorating. The jokes and scenarios
have steadily worsened as the
series has progressed, screwing
up the lives of J.D., Turk (Donald
Faison, "Clueless"), Eliot and the
rest of the Sacred Heart Hospital
employees.
But these flaws can't all be
blamed on the creative team.
When the writer's strike began
in November 2007, the show
hadn't completed filming on sea-
son seven, and when it finally
returned to the air, the writers
had little time to resolve the vari-
ous storylines that were intro-
duced before the work stoppage.
With the series's fate undeter-
mined as it resumed in April
2007 - it was rumored that NBC

was going to drop "Scrubs" from
the lineup - it's clear that the
"Scrubs" writers scrambled for
an ending just to cover their asses
in case the show ended up getting
canceled.
Thankfully, "Scrubs" has
another shot to redeem itself after
its disastrous seventh season. Two
seconds away from being canned,
the show was picked up by ABC for
this year.
Thus far in it's eighth season,
"Scrubs" has lacked the goofy buf-
foonery it's known for, and that's
probably due to a lack of screen
time for its most humorous char-
acters. Turk, an extremely promi-
nent character in past seasons, was
barely even in the premier. Even
"The Todd" (Robert Maschio, "As
the World Turns") and his banana
hammock were nowhere to be
seen. . .
With the limited air time old
characters have been given thus
far, it seems the new interns will
What happened
to J.D.'s fantasies
and the oddball
one-liners?
be given larger roles this season.
Unfortunately, the newbies aren't
nearly as funny as those they're
replacing, especially Doug, the
intern who works at the morgue,
and another intern fondly known
as Snoop Dogg Intern. Speaking of
newbies, there's also a new chief
of medicine: Dr. Maddox, played
by Courtney Cox ("Friends"). Cox
doesn't fit into the "Scrubs" uni-
verse and lacks the mean-spirited
humor of the old chief of medicine,
Dr. Kelso (Ken Jenkins, "The Sum
of All Fears").
Fans who have followed the
show since its beginning will
want to believe "Scrubs" still has
something substantial to offer.

Sure the hospital staff is as quirky
and politically incorrect as ever,
and the writing is trying awfully
hard to be sharp. But let's face it:
From what we've seen so far in the
eighth season, "Scrubs" is far from
what it used tobe. Even the show's
life lessons are beginning to get a
bit tiring.
This season of "Scrubs" should
be the last. Not just because it
seems poised to suck, but because
the characters are growing out of

their roles; J.D. has a kid for cry-
ing out loud. The "Scrubs" creative
team should use this potential last
go around to revive the punchy
one-liners and the strange fan-
tasies of J.D. that made the early
seasons so memorable.
It's time for "Scrubs" to wrap
up with dignity before it starts to
resemble the lovechild of "E:R."
and "Everybody Loves Raymond"
- overly dramatic and totally
unfunny.

said. "I was lucky, but if I was going
to class I would have been late."
Cary Tedder, a senior in the
School of Music, Theatre and Y".r
Dance, witnessed the chaotic after-
math of the water main break on
Murfin Avenue around 12:30 p.m.
after he got out of class. ,,
"Water was running all the way
down Murfin," Tedder said. "It
was gushing and there were tons of
police cars in the street. Now all of
the bus routes are longer and more
complicated."
DPS spokeswoman Diane Brown
said Plant Operations has been5 r
working to repair the main since
it broke yesterday. She said she
expects the main to be fixed some-
time today at the earliest.
Brown added that the break
has been isolated, and there's no
impact on the water service to
any of the surrounding buildings.
ROBMIGRIN/Daily
Daily Staff Reporter Lara Zade A water main broke yesterday on North Campus. Murfin Avenue was closed from Hayward Street to Duffield Drive and buses
contributed to this report. and other traffic was re-routed for the afternoon.

When asked about some critics'
argument that Michigan's current
problems arise from its homoge-
neity and almost single-minded
focus on the automotive and relat-
ed industries, Granholm stressed
the importance of diversifying
the Michigan economy as much as
possible.
"We want to put people back to
work today, but at the same time
we need to make the necessary

"It took all ofus together, and we
failed a lot in the first three to four
years of our work together, but we
always banded together and tried
again," she said.
Kotov said the development is
notonlyan achievementinbiomed-
ical research, but it will also help to
revitalize the state's economy.
"We are trying to re-energize
the biotechnology sector of econo-
my in Michigan and to bring new
ideas to the industry in the diffi-
cult economic times," he said.
"The package should include
funding to ready-to-go infrastruc-
ture projects such as roads, water,
sewer and Great Lakes restoration
and navigation," he wrote in the
statement."
He wrote that funding should
go toward producing alternative
energy, keeping people in their
homes and education and health
information technologies.
In its current form, the House
bill includes $54 billion for the
development of green energy
from renewable resources and
$90 billion for nationwide infra-
structure upgrades.
Additionally, Levin wrote that
he hopes the package will provide
"direct assistance to states so that
they don't have to make signifi-
cant cuts in state programs."
He also wrote about bring-
ing manufacturing jobs back
to Michigan and the industrial
Midwest as a whole, saying that
such jobs are the linchpin of the
regional economy.
Levinwrote thatthis shiftmust
occur with the help of "federal
grants to spur the development
and manufacturing of advanced
batteries that will power the next
generation of green technology
vehicles."
With the stimulus bills pend-
ing approval in both the U.S.
House and the Senate, the state's
lawmakers are still waiting to
make their requests for fund-
ing on a broad range of proj-
eets. Exactly how that money
is allocated will be determined
in the coming months, but both
Granholm and Levin expressed
optimism about the future of
the states economy.
"If we spend money inthe right
places, we can put people to work
immediately," Levin wrote.
ISRAEL RALLY
From Page 1
about 1,100 Palestinians and 13
Israelis have died in the conflict.
"Israel asa state will continue
to exist forever," Parritz said, to
a chorus of cheers and applause
from the crowd. "Any person
people or governmentwho wish-
es to extinguish this reality will
surely do so at their own peril."
Following Parritz's speech,
students led the crowd in the
song "Am Yisrael Chai," or "The
Nation of Israel Lives."
The rally concluded with the
crowd singing the Israeli nation-
al anthem. LSA freshman Alex
Kaminski said he was "touched"
by the rally.
"Israel has been at the cen-
ter of a lot of negative press and
false accusations," he said. "It
drives me up the wall."
Kaminsky said that he was
pleased with the turnout at the

rally, despite the below-zero
weather.
"It really shows how passion-
ate people are and how much
they care about the civilians
whose lives have been affected
for two or three years," he said.
Business School sophomore
Adam Keitt said it was "nice to
see" that both the pro-Palestin-
ian rally at the Union last night
and the pro-Israel rally both
concluded peacefully.

Fisher reminisces
about unexpected
national title
By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor
Steve Fisher can remember it
clearly.
As fans took their seats in the
Seattle Kingdome before the 1989
NCAA National Championship
Game, Fisher looked on as Michi-
gan men's basketball star forward
Glen Rice laid on a training table.
Team trainer Jerry O'Connor
wrapped Rice's ankles like he
did before any other game. But

So relaxed er Arena
that he was TV:
sleeping. BTN
O'Connor
pointed to
Fisher and laughed as the even-
tual Most Outstanding Player of
the tournament lay as calm as ever
before the biggest game of his life.
"You could sense a growing
belief in confidence in a group of
guys that they were on the brink
of achieving something that had
never happened to them or the
program," Fisher said.
Rice led Michigan to its first
and only basketball title by scoring
a record 184 points in the Tourna-
ment.
Rice and most of his teammates
will be honored Saturday for their
1989 NCAA title when the 24th-
ranked Wolverines face Ohio State
at Crisler Arena. The current team
will wear dark blue replicas of the

1989 uniforms to celebrate the
20th anniversary.
Fisher, now the head coach at
San Diego State, won't be in atten-
dance for tomorrow's festivities.
He was fired in 1997 amid accusa-
tions involving former booster Ed
Martin.
But Fisher still keeps in contact
with many of his former players,
including Rob Pelinka, Terry Mills
and Sean Higgins.
"Those kids are no longer kids,"
Fisher said. "They're in their 40s
now. It doesn't seem possible."
Then-Athletic Director Bo
Schembechler named Fisher
interim head coach on the eve
of the 1989 NCAA Tournament
after then-head coach Bill Frie-
der accepted the head coaching
job at Arizona State with the plan
to join the Sun Devils after the
Tournament. When Schembechler
discovered Frieder's plans, he
immediately fired Frieder and
replaced him with Fisher, famous-
ly saying "a Michigan man will
coach Michigan, not an Arizona
State man."
Known as a true teacher to his
players, Fisher led the Wolverines
past Virginia and No. 1 seed Illi-
nois to advance to the champion-
ship game against Seton Hall.~ FILE PHOTO
"It truly happened in such a Terry Mills celebrates Michigan's win overVirginia. which sent the Wolverines to the

to worry or get nervous," Fisher
said.
And as Michigan and Seton Hall
went into overtime, there wasn't
room for nerves.
The Pirates fouled Wolverine
guard Rumeal Robinson' with
three seconds left in the extra
frame and the Wolverines down
one. Robinson had been in the
exact situation earlier that season
against Wisconsin when both his
free throws clanked off the rim.
After the Wisconsin loss, Fisher
remembers Robinson telling him,
"I'm not going to ever let that hap-
pen to me again."
The next time was different.
Robinson drained both shots to
put Michigan up by one. The Wol-

verines won the game, 80-79 (OT).
"They took a timeout to try to
make him a little extra nervous,
and I could just see in his eyes
that he had a calmness about
him," Fisher said of Robinson. "He
meant what he said - he was going
to make them."
Most of the current Wolver-
ines aren't old enough to remem-
ber Michigan's title run, and six
weren't even born at the time. But
Michigan coach John Beilein said
his staff emphasizes the program's
history to the team.
"(Freshman center) Ben Cronin,
born in (1989), once asked me, 'Was
Michigan ever good in basketball?'
" Beilein said with a laugh.
Fisher is in his 18th season as

a head coach and has dealt with
his share of joy and turmoil. But
Fisher said his greatest memories
are the personal experiences he
shared with his family and play-
ers. His oldest son Mark, who he
once held in his arm as his team
cut down the nets in 1989, is now
an assistant coach with his father
at San Diego State.
Fisher said he doesn't feel like
it's been 20 years since Michigan's
historic run. And if you ask him,
he's okay with it.
"I think that's the beauty of it,"
Fisher said. "It seems like you can
close your eyes and relive many,
many of the moments that trans-
pired in that magical run that we
had."

Hagelin leads resurgent offensive production

Sophomore Swede finally starting to get things going.

against Miami (Ohio), seven of the "I believe I ceAre: Yost
Wolverines' nine goals came from should have had

And one of the players Michi- than I had for
gan hoped to rely on this season is sure," Hagelin said. "Even though

you aren't playing your best, you
have to keep working hard."
The Wolverines have dominat-
ed opponents since the Michigan
State series last December, scoring
at least four goals in every game.
The biggest reason for the resur-
gence is balanced scoring.
Although Michigan's top line of
sophomores Aaron Palushaj and
Louie Caporusso and freshman
David Wohlberg have 35 goals on
the season, the second and third
lines have started to pick up some
of the slack.
One of the biggest contributors
is Hagelin, who is also known for
his stellar play on the penalty kill
and nearly unmatched speed on
the ice. The better he plays, the
more energy and enthusiasm he
has for the game.
"I feel alot better, actually, even
in practice," Hagelin said. "I feel
like I have more energy and am
more confident with the puck. It's
easy to play when the whole team
is playing better."
Last weekend, Ijagelin showed
off his ability with a man down,
not only helping to successfully
kill a RedHawk penalty but also
scoring a shorthanded goal in the
first game of the series. Hagelin
connected on a rebound goal off
a shot fellow sophomore linemate
Matt Rust.
Both Hagelin and Ruststruggled
earlier this season but are start-

ing to find their stride. That's the
theme of most of the Wolverines'
offensive parings: It's difficult for
a line to succeed when only one
forward is playing well.
"Both those guys are unbeliev-
able players, and whenever they're
on their game, this team doesn't
have much trouble winning,"
Caporusso said.
Michigan has a home-and-home
series against Bowling Green this
weekend, and although the Falcons
(7-12-3 overall, 4-9-1-0 CCHA) are
struggling this season, Michigan
can't afford to overlook them.
Bowling Green's sophomore
goaltender Nick Eno, who has
missed most of the season to inju-
ry, is expected to return and will
likely provide a boost for the Fal-
cons.
The Wolverines are tied for
fifth place in the CCHA and are 10
points behind conference leader
Notre Dame.
Michigan's sweep of No. 10
Miami last weekend was vital for
the Wolverines to stay in the con-
ference race, but coupled with a
