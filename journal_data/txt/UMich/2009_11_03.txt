Three candidates
running unopposed
in election as well
By BETHANY BIRON
Daily StaffReporter
Ann Arbor residents will head
to the polls today for the general
city election, where they will vote
to seat candidates for two-year
terms in each of the city's five
wards.
Only two of the five seats are
contested, placing the focus of
this year's elections on the 1st
Ward, between incumbent Sabra
Briere (D-Ward 1) and indepen-
dent Mitchell Ozog, and the 4th
Ward, which features incumbent
Marcia Higgins (D-Ward 4) and
LSA senior Hatim Elhady.
Elhady, who is running as an
independent, said the issues he
dealt with as a student at the Uni-
versity - limited transportation

and shady landlords, among other
things - emphasized to him the
need for student representation
on the council.
He said he spoke with many
Ann Arbor residents about their
concerns, which helped him make
the ultimate decision to run in the
4th Ward.
"It was not only the feelings of
neglect toward me as a student
and resident, but neglect for the
homeowners," Elhady said. "We
all shared that commonality for
issues ... and that motivated me to
run."
Elhady believes that because
he is intimately involved with the
University - as a student and a
former member of the Michigan
Student Assembly - he has a leg
up on his opponent when it comes
to representing the constituents of
the 4th Ward. The ward extends
from East Madison Street south-
ward past Ann Arbor-Saline Road
and includes the Fletcher and

CITY COUNCIL
,City officials get 90 days
to mull over Argo Dam

CAMPUS CRIME
This Halloween, Elm St. block
party ends with brutal beating

State environmental
agency says city must
make minor fix now
By JENNA SKOLLER
Daily News Editor
The Ann Arbor City Attorney's
Office announced yesterday that it
reached a partial compromise with
the Michigan Department of Envi-
ronmental Quality over safety con-
cerns regarding the water quality
of Argo Dam.
With this agreement, the DEQ
agreed to a 90-day stay of its order
for the city to either repair or
remove the dam. The agreement
did, however, also include a tempo-
rary, minor fix that had to be made
to the dam immediately.
The dam was initially built in
1920 to create hydropower for Ann

Arbor. Today, it serves as a barrier
to the natural flow of the Huron
River, which makes the body of
water before it, called Argo Pond,
available for recreational activi-
ties - like practice for the five Ann
Arbor-area rowing teams including
the Michigan Men's Club Rowing
Team.
A letter was sent from the DEQ to
City Administrator Roger Fraser on
Aug. 6 thatsaid the dam's embank-
ment was in "poor condition due
to seepage of water through the
earthen embankment and due to
the extensive growth of trees and
brush on the embankment."
The letter demanded the city
either remove or repair the dam by
April 2010, in addition to fixingthat
minor repair in the dam. It stated
that larger repairs must be made
by Dec. 31, 2010 or the dam must be
removed by Dec. 31, 2012.
DEQ officials had feared the

embankment of the pond was at
risk of flooding, which City Coun-
cilmember Mike Anglin (D-Ward
5) says is no longer a concern
because the city can now control
the amount of water going into the
headrace - or a secondary body of
water next tosthe pond that the dam
also funnels water into.
As was previously reported in
a Sept. 27 article in The Michigan
Daily, DEQ had wanted the flow
into the headrace stopped so that
"embankment deficiencies" could
be better monitored there.
The city was initially given until
Nov. 1 to block the flow into the
headrace.
The letter sent to Fraser in
August resulted in a large debate
over whether to remove or repair
the dam. The discussion was tabled
by City Council in late October, and
city officials instead focused on

Man hospitalized
after trying to drive
through street
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
The annual Halloween block.
party "Nightmare on Elm Street"
ended Saturday night with a bru-
tal beating and the hospitalization
of a man trying to drive his vehicle
down the crowded street located
east of Central Campus.
A 19-year-old male was driv-
ing down Elm Street Saturday
night when a group of people -
reportedly in their late teens and
early twenties - started to throw
objects at his Mazda, Ann Arbor
Police Sgt. Mike Lance said.
Lance could not confirm if the
driver was a University student.
According to the police report
of the incident, several individu-
als became upset because the man
was trying to drive through the
crowd. The group began pounding

on the car and attempted to open
the doors and get inside.
One subject succeeded in open-
ing the front passenger door and
began yelling at the driver, who
then stepped out of his vehicle,
according to the report. The sub-
ject then began punching the driv-
er in the face and knocked him to
the ground. Five more individuals
then joined in the beating.
Lance said the Ann Arbor Police
Department received a call at 11:18
p.m. and appeared on the scene
at 11:21 p.m. When police arrived,
the victim had been placed on
the porch of a nearby residence.
He was given initial medical care
before being transferred to the
University Hospital.
LSA junior Jayant Krishnan was
on Elm Street before the incident
occurred. He said a large crowd
was forming and people were get-
ting rowdy.
"It was a huge group of kids
who were just causing lots of shit
on the street," he said. "There
were like 30 kids just kind of
wreaking havoc."

Krishnan said a. man also hit
him in the face before the driver
was beaten up. He said he believed
the individual who hit him was
the same man who began beating
the driver.
Krishnan said he saw a bunch
of people jumping on the victim's
car and throwing bottles at the
vehicle. When the driver stepped
out of his car, Krishnan said the
driver was "gang beat by a bunch
of kids."
"They threw him on the ground
and literally gang beat him," he
said. "The last thing I saw was a
kid tryingto curb stomp him."
Krishnan could not describe the
victim, but said he looked injured.
"All I saw was his face covered
in blood," he said.
Kinesiology sophomore Emily
Bonchi was walking down Elm
Street while the victim was being
attacked. She said she saw a group
of about 15 people participating in
the fight.
"Some of them were beating
him up, some of them were break-

Robert Koonce, the gregarious
director of BBA Student Affairs

When University alum Joseph
Beal Steere began an expedition in
1870, he probably didn't realize that
many of the 62,000'specimens he
found - most of them unknown to
science at the time - would become
the basis for the largest fossil muse-
um in the state of Michigan.
The Alexander Ruthven Muse-
ums Building, located across the
street from C.C. Little, houses four
museums: the Exhibit Museum of
Natural History, and the Museums
of Anthropology, Zoology and Pale-
ontology.
The spiraling staircases and vin-
tage decor of the Exhibit Museum
of Natural History create an archaic
feel. The cases of animals and shelves
of fossils lining the museum's walls
date back more than a century.
Exhibits at the museum come
from around the world. One display
includes two full mastodons, one of

which was found in Owosso, Mich.,
while another exhibit includes a Sau-
ropod dinosaur fossil.
Rotatingexhibits include an arche-
ology display as part of an upcoming
theme, "Explore Evolution."
Of the four museums, three of
thes are closed to the general public
and are used for research, The fourth
unit, the Museum of Natural Histo-
ry, has four floors and holds exhibits
on paleontology, zoology, Michigan
wildlife, anthropology, archaeology,
geology and a planetarium.
The museum was in the origi-
nal 1837 charter of the University
and the building is the namesake
of former University President and
Museum Curator Alexander Ruth-
ven, according to a plaque on the
museum's wall.
Though there are many museums
on campus, the Exhibit Museum of
Natural History hires the most stu-

dents. According to Museum Docent
Coordinator Sarah Thompson, the
museum has approximately 50 stu-
dent docents who are trained guides
that give tours to children in Kinder-
garten through 12th grade, greet the
general public and answer questions
about the museum.
"They're the face of the museum,"
Thompson said. -
The museum draws in about
85,000 people every year, includ-
ing 21,000 school-aged children,
Thompson said. But despite its on-
campus location, it doesn't attract
many University students.
"I don't think most students know
about this," Thompson said. "I can't
tell you how many people I talk to
who say they walk by the building
every day and have never went in -
they know the two pumas that stand
outside but never what's inside."

The contrasting messages
appear designed to keep the
international community off bal-
ance on how far Iran is ready to
go in accepting the original pro-
posal.
Addressing the U.N. General
Assembly, Mohamed ElBarade
said "a number of questions and
allegations relevant to the nature"
of Irans program remained, and
he called for confidence building
measures on all sides.
"I therefore urge Iran to be
as forthcoming as possible in
responding soon to my recent

of the U.S., Russia and France,
which aimed to engage in a series
of measures that could build con-

The U.S. and other powers are
concerned Iran may be enriching
uranium for use in nuclear weap-

energy production.
Iran's mixed messages also
appeared geared toward pushing
the plan's main backers into fur-

tries oppose as a delaying tactic.

Man threatens
abortion doctor
Federal prosecutors say state-
ments from a Washington man
accused of threatening a Colorado
abortion doctor's family should be
admitted in court.
Donald Hertz of Spokane has
said authorities didn't read him his
constitutional rights before ques-
tioning him and that his statements
aren't admissible.
He is accused of calling the
Boulder Abortion Clinic in June
and threatening to kill Dr. Warren
Hern's family. Hertz faces charges
of making an interstate threat and
of violating a law protecting access
to reproductive health services.
Prosecutors said in a federal
court filing yesterday that authori-
ties didn't have to read Hertz
his rights because he wasn't in
custody when he allegedly told
investigators he called the clinic.
CHICAGO
Half of American
kids will receive
food stamps
Nearly half of all U.S. children
and 90 percent of black youngsters
will be on food stamps at some
point during childhood, and fallout
from the current recession could
push those numbers even higher,
researchers say.
The estimate comes from an
analysis of 30 years of national data,
and it bolsters other recent evidence
on the pervasiveness of youngsters
at economic risk. It suggests that
almost everyone knows a family
who has received food stamps, or
will in the future, said lead author
Mark Rank, a sociologist at Wash-
ington University in St. Louis.
"Your neighbor may be using
some of these programs but it's not
the kind of thing people want to talk
about," Rank said.
The analysis was released yes-
terday in the November issue of
Archives of Pediatrics and Adoles-.
cent Medicine. The authors say it's a
medical issue pediatricians need to
be aware of because children on food
stamps are at risk for malnutrition
and other ills linked with poverty.
WASHINGTON D.C.
GOP's troubles may
continue
For Republicans, an election win
of any size today would be a bless-
ing. But victories in Virginia, New
Jersey or elsewhere won't erase
enormous obstacles the party faces
heading into a 2010 midterm elec-
tion year when control of Congress
and statehouses from coast to coast
will be up for grabs.
It's been a tough few years for
the GOP. The party lost control of
Congress in 2006 and then lost the
White House in 2008 with three
traditional Republican states -
Indiana, North Carolina and Vir-
ginia - abandoning the party.
So even if political winds start
blowing harder behind them and
even if they can capitalize on Demo-

cratic missteps, Republicans still
will have a long way to go over the
next year because of their party's
own fundamental problems - divi-
sions over the path forward, the lack
of a national leader and a shrinking
base in a changing nation.

Clinton curbs praise
of Israeli policy
In the face of Arab criticism of
the administration's recalibrated
Mideast peace tack, U.S. Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
moderated her praise yesterday for
Israel's offer to restrain building set-
tlements in Palestinian areas.
While Israel was moving in the
right direction in its offer to restrict
but not stop the settlements, Clinton
said, its offer "falls far short" of U.S.
expectations.
Clinton said her earlier praise of
Israel's offer, during a stop in Jeru-
salem, had been intended as "posi-
tive reinforcement." But they drew
widespread criticism from Persian
Gulf ministers who interpreted it as
a softening of the U.S. position on
settlements, which stand in the way
of aresumption of Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
In a sign of U.S. eagerness to calm
Arab concerns about the U.S.position
on settlements, Cylinton is extend-
ing her trip by one day to fly to Cairo
to meet with President Hosni Muba-
rak tomorrow, her staff announced.
She had been scheduled to return to
Washington today.

Debate on paying
for Mich. public
schools begins

Schools could face
consolidation to cut
costs, save money
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Fif-
teen years ago, Michigan changed
the way it pays for public education,
switching from local property taxes
to a mix of sales and property taxes,
lottery revenue and other money.
Now, with cuts ofnearly $300 per
student looming and some districts
looking at losing as much as $600
per student, think tanks, business
groups and education advocates are
calling for looking again at the way
Michigan pays for public schools.
"The reduction in school rev-
enues is really a product of the
economy tanking," says former
state Rep. Lynn Jondahl, who
was the Democratic House Taxa-
tion Committee chairman when
Proposal A passed. He's now
working with the group, A Bet-
ter Michigan Future, to get the
state's finances on a more stable
footing.
"We're in deep trouble a year
from now without the stimulus
money," he says.
Schools are scrambling to
absorb cuts being imposed on
them this month. Total cuts in the
public education budget total $292

per student.
That's not even counting the $52
million Democratic Gov. Jennifer
Granholm vetoed for wealthier
school districts that get as much as
$4,000more per pupil than schools
getting the lowest per-pupil
grants. Those include more than
two dozen in southeast Michigan
and others - such as East Lansing,
Saugatuck and Detour - scattered
around the state.
Those school districts are
looking at decreases of as much
as $600 per student.
Lawmakers could erase some of
the cuts school districts face. They
have until Nov. 21 to come up with
more revenue that would erase the
$127-per-student cut Granholm
imposed last week because she
says the school aid budget isn't bal-
anced - a statement Senate Repub-
licans dispute.
Lawmakers also could override
Granholm's veto of the $52 million
for the wealthier districts by then,
although that's a tougher task
since it takes a two-thirds vote in
both the House and Senate.
The cuts would have been even
worse if the state didn't have
$450 million in federal stimulus
money to draw on for schools.
The federal dollars saved schools
from another $280-per-student
decrease this school year.

Community college
enrollment soars
during recession
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Arthur
Call commutes three hours roundtrip
to his anatomy class at community
college because similar courses on
campuses closer to his Indianapolis
home are packed thissemester.
"Classes around the state were
just full," says Call, a full-time stu-
dent who takes the rest of his classes
in Indianapolis. "Thank God it's only
Tuesdays. I just have to drive there
once a week."
President Barack Obama wants to
invest some $12 billion in community
colleges with the aim of seeing an
additional 5 million students gradu-
ate by 2020. This goal comes while
many schools are already bursting at
the seams with droves of displaced
workers hit by the recession compet-
ing with traditional students seeking
an education bargain.
"All community colleges are not
prepared to take on those poten-
tially large numbers of students,"
said Debra Bragg, a professor and
director of the Forum on the Future
of Public Education at the University
of Illinois.

The Obama administration notes
that 5 million more community col-
lege graduates doesn't necessarily
mean there will be that many more
students - schools could increase
graduation rates to reach the goal.
And the administration says money
from the 10-year initiative to rebuild
aging facilities and establish online
classes would help schools handle the
extrastudents.
Bragg says the schools' ability
to deal with more students largely
comes downto cash.
Much of the money for the nation's
1,200 community colleges comes
from local and state sources. That
funding has been hard to come by
during the economic downturn, even
as enrollment booms. In California,
community colleges are struggling
to cope with $840 million in budget
cuts while enrollment is expected to
climb.
Obama's 10-year initiative would
provide a welcome infusion of cash,
but some fear it would not sustain
community college programs.
"They will be constrained by
funding," says Bragg. "It could be
potentially extremely. challenging if
there's not increased funding at the
federal, state and local level to make
that happen."
The conundrum comes at a time

of intense growth for the more than
century-old community college sys-
tem, which already educates more
than half the nation's undergradu-
ates.
And more young Americans than
ever are going to college, particularly
community college. A record high of
about 11.5 million Americans age 18
to 24, or nearly 40 percent, attended
college in October 2008, according
to a study of Census data recently
released by the Pew Research Center.
Almost all of the increase of 300,000
students over the previous year came
at two-year schools.
About 12 percent of18-to24-year-
olds were enrolled in community col-
leges last year,up from10.9 percent in
2007.
Enrollment numbers are not yet
available for the fall 2009 semes-
ter, but the American Association
of Community Colleges estimates
enrollment is up at least 10 percent
over 2008. Some schoolshave report-
ed increases of 25 to 30percent.
Michael Hansen, president of
the Michigan Community College
Association, says classes in popular
fields such as nursing require low
student-to-faculty ratios and expen-
sive equipment. He is concerned it
will be difficult to meet new demand
without yet more funding.

Manufacturing,
home building show
signs for recovery
NEW YORK (AP) - Hopes for
the fledgling economic recovery
got a boost yesterday from better-
than-expected news on manufac-
turing, construction and contracts
to buy homes.
U.S. manufacturing activity
grew in October at the fastest pace
in more than three years, accord-
ing to a private group's measure. It
was driven by government spend-
ing, businesses' need to rebuild
their inventories and higher
demand from overseas.
The Commerce Department
said construction spending rose
in September on the strength of
home building. The report sup-
ported optimism that the ail-
ing housing sector is starting to
revive.
And the number of signed con-
tracts to buy previously occupied
homes rose for the eighth straight
month in September, according to
the National Association of Real-
tors.
Still, President Barack Obama
said the public and private sec-
tors must find more ways to cre-
ate jobs to continue the recovery.

In remarks at the start of a White
House meeting with economic
advisers, Obama credited his stim-
ulus package for recent upticks in
economic numbers, including the
manufacturing boost reported
yesterday.
The president said there's still
"a long wayto go," especially when
it comes to job creation. "We are
still seeing production levels that
are significantly below peak levels
and most distressing is the fact
that job growth continues to lag,"
Obama said.
The trio of positive reports
about areas of the economy that
could help power a recovery
helped drive Wall Street higher
earlier in the day before a retreat
in financial stocks pulled the
broader market lower. The Dow
Jones industrials added about 25
points in afternoon trading, while
broader indexes dipped.
Still, with jobs scarce, lend-
ing tight and consumers wary of
spending, it's unclear whether
the strength can be sustained as
government stimulus programs
wind down. For example, the
contracts to buy homes rose as
buyers scrambled to take advan-
tage of a tax credit for first-time
owners that expires at the end of
this month. Congress is moving to
extend the credit until April 30.

Change to admissions policy promotes importance of arts

W hen University Provost Teresa Sullivan laughs and con-
fesses to not knowing why the University recalculates
the GPAs of high school applicants, it's probably not a
well-advised policy. Last week, the administration decided to end
this time-consuming practice in order to focus on other aspects of
the admissions process - a welcome change. Recalculated GPAs
removed important classes, including most arts classes, from a
student's GPA. The University should value high school students'
achievements in all courses, not just ones in mainstream subjects,
as a way of encouraging high schools to maintain diverse curricula.

You're WHAT?

Until last week, the University's policy
was to remove courses that did not fall into
the major academic categories and recalcu-
late each applicant's GPA, though all classes
were still factored in as part of the student's
coursework. But with the policy change,
the University will now simply evaluate the
GPA that appears on an applicant's tran-
script. Administrators claim that GPA isn't
a major factor in the admissions process
in any case, and that this change will save
time.
No matter how little GPA actually counts
toward a student's admission, the calcula-
tion should still include all of a student's
coursework. Arbitrarily removing art class-
es discounts students who worked hard
and received good grades in those classes.
Proficiency in classes that are outside the
English/math/science/history mainstream
is exactly what the admissions office should
be looking for.
For a University that claims to value
diversity, it's wrong to put high school
students who performed well in fine arts
courses at a disadvantage. The arts play a
valuable intellectual role in the education
of many.scuenc.an .-should be treated as.
such. After all, the University offers many

such classes, and excelling in at least some
of them is a necessity for most University
students. Changing this policy, if nothing
else, sends the message that the University
does weigh the merits of all academic sub-
jects.
Sendingsuch a message is more important
than ever. With funding for K-12 education
decreasing across the state to compensate
for the budget deficit, high schools will be
looking for ways to cut costs. Universities
shouldn't be indicating that arts and other
courses are less important and could be cut
to save money. If students don't have access
to these classes in high school, they will be
less prepared to handle the diverse range
of coursework that college offers them.
High schools should try to preserve these
classes, and the University should reward
students who excel in them.
Creating a strong intellectual commu-
nity isn't accomplished solely by evaluating
math, natural sciences, history and English
- the fine arts and other areas are a part
of that too, and the University should use
this change in policy as an opportunity to
give fair consideration for candidates from
.all backgrounds.andncourage-theirintel-
lectual curiosity.

S o Halloween weekend was
pretty dece, right? ("Dece"
is a cool word that I learned
recently. I think,
though I'm not
entirely sure, that
it's an abbreviated
form of "decent" '
and was coined -
like so many of our
modern words -
by Shakespeare.) -
Indeed, I think WILL
many of us had an GRUNDLER
awse time. Admit-
tedly, I didn't think
my Mary Sue Cole-
man costume (Amazon, $49.99) could
be beat, but as the night wore on and
I saw Gumby and The Burger King
and people kept offering me punch,
I began to question my judgment on
things.
But this week's column isn't, unfor-
tunately, about those happy times,
about those few good, clean, dece
costumes that I saw, or about how
students were pinnacles of morality. I
wish it wereI really do. Yet can I let
my conscience stand idly by, smoking
its last cigarettegDoes that mtap;grp
work? The answer toboth questions is
absolutely not.
Therefore, this week's column is
about the consequences of modern-
day Halloween at the 'U' - about bad
costumes - you know, offensive cos-
tumes,.costumes that you wouldn't
want your little sister to see because
she would get nightmares, or ideas.
Well, not really, because by bad cos-
tumes I mean BAD costumes, like
those students who attached card-
board boxes to themselves in order to
look like robots when, in reality, they
looked like cardboard boxes. Hon-
estly, you-just can't help those types

of people. So let's make fun of them,
starting with the delightfully unintel-
ligent person who decided to be a
1. Mustard Container: Honest-
ly, what do you say to a person who
thinks a condiment would be a neat
idea for a costume? Beats me. But is
wearing a yellow frock and a yellow
pointy hat really worth the effort just
to say "squeeze me"? The poor guy
even had "Mustard" written in big
black letters on his chest in case peo-
ple didn't realize that he was, in fact,
mentally unstable. Maybe I didn't
see his friend who was Ketchup or
Hot dog or something, but later on, I
glimpsed his pal who had the insight
and courage tobe a
2. Jar of Milk: Now, this guy had
enough sense to avoid writing "Milk"
on his costume, but come ON! Milk?
You're MILK? Have I got that right?
You're an emulsion of butterfat glob-
ules within a water-based fluid?
(Always use Wiktionary to strength-
en your insults.) Couldn't you think
of anything better than a glass jar of
milk? I'm sorry that I'm getting so
upset. Maybe the guy wanted this
type of reaction. In fact, maybe he's
,s ociology major., Mgyb heq Ilently
defended his costume and said, "Oh,
YEAH? Why CAN'T I be a jar of
milk?" Maybe he got punched in the
face by
3. Men in Tights: Noticing a trend?
Yes, guys seem to choose dumber cos-
tumes than girls. This is an estab-
lished biological fact. There were
plenty of men wearing tights last
Saturday night, but I ran into a stag-
geringly awkward guy wearing tights
and a leotard who was apparently
mocking Beyonce's hit song "Single
Ladies." Now, I love "Single Ladies,"
but that's not what concerned me.
The costume was funny, actually.

What concerned me was that after
approximately a nanosecond, the cos-
tume stopped being funny. The guy
didn't try to SELL it, you know? He
just stood there, saying nothing, in his
leotard. Needless to say, I motioned to
something behind him, waited until
he turned around and then bolted.
But the most awkward costume goes
to
This year's
worst Halloween
costumes.
4. MCard Girl: (Rejoice, men!) I'm
not acquainted with this student and
I don't hold anything against her as a
person, but she had possibly the worst
costume ever, a costume so cringe-
worthy that my face still ached the
following morning. What she had
(inexplicably) done was cut a head-
sized hole in a piece of cardboard,
decorate the cardboard so it looked
like a, MCard, and then (l*gera ' the
odd part) she wore it on her face. I
was completely baffled. I thought I
had seen all there was to see when it
came to people dressing up as arbi-
trary objects, but I was wrong. She's
a bit hard to describe, but imagine
a person who headbutts a painting
and then wears it around proudly. I
briefly considered writing "MCard"
on her forehead in big black letters,
but I refrained myself. I mean, I was
the president of the University. What
could I do?

School millage is necessary
for quality education
TO THE DAILY:
Unprecedented cuts to K-12 education fund-
ing have put school districts across the state in
a terrible situation. Here in Washtenaw Coun-
ty, several school districts that had already
balanced their budgets for the year were blind-
sided by the state's severe cuts to education
funding. Ann Arbor's school system alone faces
a $17.5 million shortfall this coming fiscal year.
This is not the result of waste or inefficiency -
Washtenaw County schools have in fact been
cutting their budgets for years. This gap is the
result of a state government that has lost its
sense of duty. We can correct this glaring mis-
take by voting yes on Proposal 1, which would
institute a millage to mitigate the effect of the
state's cuts.
Opponents of the millage argue that schools
should make deeper cuts to their programming
given that families are suffering economi-
cally throughout the county, state and nation.
There is, however, little left to cut. Washtenaw
County schools have already increased class
sizes, reduced custodial staffing, consolidat-
ed administration operations and eliminated
enrichment programs. For some schools in the
county, even cutting all arts and athletics pro-
grams would still not be enough to make up the
gap.
We all know that education is the key to the
revival of Michigan's economy. Also, any small
increases in property taxes will be more than
made up for by the increases in property values
for county residents. Families choose where to
live based on the quality of the public schools,
and good schools will draw new residents to
the area.
For students, most of whom plan to leave the
area after graduation, the future of Washtenaw
County may seem trivial and distant. But the
fundamental importance of education is not.
We encourage students to think about the high
quality primary and secondary education that
many of them received. Taking five minutes to
vote today will help grant tomorrow's children
the same opportunities you had.

Good sportsmanship starts
at the top
TO THE DAILY:
As a lifelong fan of Penn State football and a
15-year fan of Big Ten football, I appreciate the
opportunity to reach out to like-minded Big Ten
fans. As a frequent visitor to Ann Arbor, I have
found the overwhelming majority of Michigan
fans to be very similar to the overwhelming

majority of Penn State fans, who recognize that
there is no place in college sports for animosity'
toward opposing fans. They welcome us whole-
heartedly to their college, stadium and even
their tailgates. However, both universities also
have a minority of disrespectful, abusive and
embarrassing fans that get enjoyment from the
degradation of others. I would like to see that
change as much as possible at both institutions,
and I believe that both are capable of making
such a change.
Just as Ohio State has made strides to
improve what many Big Ten fans would consid-
er to be the most threatening and abusive Big
Ten game day environment, I.am hopeful that
the Michigan and Penn State will follow suit.
I truly believe that most Michigan fans find
the verbal and physical abuse that my fellow
Penn State fans and I endured on many occa-
sions this past weekend to be just as despicable
as we do when we see Michigan fans treated
the same way in Happy Valley. I believe that it
is time-for the vocal majority of good, respect-
ful fans to demand that there is no place for
bad sportsmanship before, during or after the
game.
Why is it that we demand better sportsman-
ship from our players than our fans? I never
understood how normally good, respectful
people feel better about themselves by mak-
ing derogatory, abusive comments or throw-
ing things at the fans of opposing teams. The
same can be said for the boos that welcome
the opposing team onto the field - a group of
18-21 year olds just trying to do their best -
that would not be greeted the same way in any
other scenario. I think that most of that would
change if instead of being egged on by laughter
and cheers from fellow fans, bad sportsman-
ship was properly recognized by jeers and boos
from fans wearing the same colors.
It is in the interest of all local Big Ten com-
munities to encourage the economic stimulus
that traveling fans bring, and consequently
treat opposing teams' fans more like invited
guests. Along those lines, many Penn State fans
were disappointed by the University adminis-
tration's choice to move most of the opposing
team's seats to the top of the end zone sections.
While this type of treatment may be tolerated
in truly inhospitable locations like Morgan-
town, W. Va., it should have no place in Big Ten
athletics. I am certain that traveling Michigan
fans prefer their current seats in the northeast
corner of Beaver Stadium to being strung out
along the highest rows of the north end zone
balcony. For their own interests, they should
not tolerate similar treatment of opposing fans.
In the spirit that competition makes us bet-
ter, it would be nice to add one more Big Ten
competition to see who can be the most wel-
coming and hospitable venue for opposing
team fans to visit. This message needs to start
at the top.

Local elections are just as important

0

You couldn't go anywhere on campus around this time
last year without hearing that oft repeated anthem: "Hey!
Are you registered to vote at your current address?" Get-
out-the-vote activists were on every corner, flyers and
stickers were posted on every available space and every
other conversation was about the coming election. People
groaned at the politicians' latest mistakes, talked about
how great they were in the previous night's debate and
waited in line for up to four hours on the first Tuesday in
November in order to support one candidate or the other.
Last year's election night was for some a triumph and
for others a disappointment, but everyone agreed on one
thing: History had been made. The atmosphere on cam-
pus for the whole month leading up to that Tuesday was
more electric than I've seen in my whole life here in Ann
Arbor.4
Tuesday, Nov. 3 (which happens to be today), there will
be another election. There are no national candidates,
there is little drama and relatively few people on campus
are working for and talking about the elections.
But it shouldn't be this way.
Local elections are just as important as national ones.
Your locally elected officials make huge decisions about
your lives that are often undervalued. Zoning laws allow
students to live in some places and not others. Local laws
govern how leasing works and the types of contracts that
can be drawn up. Local governments influence police poli-
cy, the municipal courtsystem, Ann Arbor Transportation
Authority buses - the list goes on and on.
This year's local elections are no different. A contested
City Council race will pit a pro-mayor candidate against
a University student. There is also a millage (property
tax) on the ballot that will define Ann Arbor's education
spending for the foreseeable future. These issues affect
the lives of everyone who lives in Ann Arbor, students or
otherwise.
Some people might claim that their votes don't mat-
ter. That is completely, patently false. During the summer
of 2008, I worked for a political candidate who ended up

losing by eight votes. Elections, especially local ones, are
decided by a tiny percentage of the electorate.
But there is areason forvotingthatgoes above and beyond
the statistics. The reason is not the candidates, the issues or
the fact that a single vote may make a difference. The reason
is that voting is what defines us as a democracy.
The vast majority of people in the United States,
including myself, believe in democracy as a theory and an
ideal. We speak out against dictatorships and for freedom
all across the world - and yet many people don't realize
what their belief in democracy means. The precise reason
we have a democracy is because it gives every citizen a
way to be heard in our society. If we hold these beliefs
and make these claims about the power of democracy but
do not participate in our own democratic government,
then we are a nation of hypocrites, fighting for free elec-
tions all over the world and then not participating in our
own back home. We are a nation of whiners, perpetually
complaining about current conditions and the state of
our lives but making no move to change them. We are a
nation of the uninterested, more worried about what hap-
pens today than decisions that could affect us years in the
future. But I believe that we are also a nation of the con-
sistent - people firm enough in our beliefs that we can
hold them strong. I believe that we are a nation of doers,
knowing when to take action to change something wrong
in the world. We are a nation of the concerned, speaking
out loud about things thatwill affect both us and our chil-
dren.
I believe in a nation where every citizen uses his or her
own voice to bring up what they believe in, and where peo-
ple participate because they know it is their obligation to
apply their beliefs to the issues that affect them directly. I
believe in a nation where we all vote.

Small-scale branding

Two days ago I went to
the unveiling of the new
William E. Upjohn Wing
of the Kelsey Museum of Archae-
ology where,
among the
ceramic cunei-
form tablets,
marble heads
of conquerors,
samples of
honey mead and
baked ancient WHITNEY
Egyptian bread, POW
there was
something new: The Kelsey had
an updated logo. The logo was a
depiction of a fragmented Roman
mosaic in the collection, placed
prominently on the wall near the
entrance. It was large, looming
and prominent, declarative of the
renovated museum's new identity.
With the new addition to the
museum came the need to re-
invent the Kelsey and what it
stands for. Logos themselves are
one of the ways a museum estab-
lishes itself, as they are symbols
of identity, and they change with
identity changes. Where the
Kelsey's logo was once the simple
title "Kelsey Museum of Archae-
ology" written in a nondescript
serif typeface - each of the words
stacked upon one another like
slices of bread - now the logo con-
veys actual symbolism, attempting
to represent the "interlocking of
cultures" (according to the visitor
guide) displayed in the Kelsey's
collection of artifacts from ancient
Egypt, Greece, the Roman Empire
and Mesopotamia.
The Kelsey's re-branding
through logo is an attempt to iden-
tify how the new museum relates
to the campus and how the collec-
tion itself has expanded to reach
areas and audiences the old build-
ing wasn't able to contain or enter-
tain. We can see this new sense
of community-orientedness and
outreach physically, too: The old
buildings looks rigid and boarding
school-like, with small windows
and the old entrance hidden in
the front porch. The new wing,
however, is sleek and modern with
boxy edges, wide, gaping win-
dows and an open, conspicuous
entrance at the new front of the
structure.

Kings' convenient ambiance

By SHARON JACOBS
Daily Arts Writer
When considering a duo like
Kings of Convenience, it's impor-
tant to think
about the pur-
pose of the
music. Kings Kingsof
don't write songs
you can dance ColVenience
to, or songs that Declaration of
will be played Decand of
on any radio sta- Dependence
tion, ever. Kings Virgin
write lovely sim-
pIe melodies outlined by acoustic
guitars. It's mellow background
music for studying or for quiet
conversation in a cozy caf6. While
they'll never headline a major fes-
tival, Erlend Oye and Rinik Glam-
baek Bee manage the task they've
set out for themselves. While their
third studio album, Declaration of
Dependence, doesn't have much
movement or development, its

sweet delicacy and sheer pretti-
ness count for a lot.
The duo hails from Scandinavia,
the region responsible for ABBA
and its Euro-pop friends, border-
line-insane metal acts like Opeth
and the occasional combustible
indie-pop darling (most recently
Peter Bjorn and John). Kings of
Convenience neatly fall into this
third category - their carefully
crafted songs are precious and

appealing at first, but they won't
hold the listener's interest for long.
Some of Kings' rambling ballads
bring to mind empty Nordic ice
fields and peaceful cities full of tall
blondes. It's a nice picture, if a bit
boring.
It's hard to believe, but Dec-
laration of Dependence is even
mellower than its dreamy prede-
cessors, Quiet is the New Loud and

'Monica: Still Standing' falls

The big, sad apple

By BRIGID KILCOIN
Daily Arts Writer
If you've been aching for origi-
nal BET pro-
gramming *
following the life
of a former R&B Monica: Still
starlet, "Monica: Standing
Still Standing"
will be right up Tuesdays
your alley. Styled at10 p.m.
in the grand tra- BET
dition of Ashlee
Simpson and Keyshia Cole's reality
shows, it follows the singer Mon-
ica, best known for her 1997 duet
with Brandy "The Boy is Mine," in
her quest to reclaim her glory days
of B-list celebrity.
The main problem with "Moni-
ca: Still Standing" is that Monica's
life is not eventful enough to merit
a show. While it seemed impos-
sible for BET to come up with a
reality show less interesting than
"Tiny and Toya" (which followed
the former flames of T.I. and Lil
Wayne around Atlanta), they have
succeeded. The two major plot
points in the premiere episode
are the remodeling of Monica's
house and a conference call with
her label. The conference call gets
canceled and the house goes unfin-
ished. Judging from the previews,
a primary plot point in the future

An anthology of
New York society
By JENNIFER XU
DailyArts Writer
Near the beginning of "New
York, I Love
You," a woman
amicably chats
with a cab driver NewYork,
about African L
music. Suddenly,
a man slides into At the State
the seat next to Vivendi
her, unaware that
the taxi was occupied. He apolo-
gizes and starts to leave, but she
insists they share the ride together.
He looks at her, she looks at him,
and they seem to want to start
a conversation, but neither
can find anything to say. So,
they resume looking out
their respective windows
in silence for the remain-
der of the journey.
This encounter lasts all
of three minutes, yet it's
a perfect encapsulation of
what it means to live in the
city of strangers. Unfortunate-
ly, this type of scene, with all
of the human awkwardness and
discomfort, doesn't appear nearly
often enough.
Proclaimed to be an anthology
on life, love and the city encircl-
ing it all, "New York, I Love You"
features 11 vignettes individu-
ally directed by heavyweights
(Mira Nair, "Amelia") and begin-
ners (Randall Balsmeyer, "Sesame
Street") alike. For most of the film,
"New York" abandons all human
aspects of a relationship in favor of
a high-gloss imitation of one. As a
result, itbecomes a pretty film that
seems to have a lot to say but ends
up not saying much.
The film manages to capture
the surface-level "essence" of New
York - the feeling portrayed in
the picture-perfect postcards that
tourists send back home. Unde-
niably, "New York" is a gorgeous

movie. In transitions, the camera
roams around the sun-steeped
benches of Central Park down
to the dizzying crowds of Grand
Central Station then across the
grimy filth of Chinatown. Shek-
har Kapur ("Elizabeth") delicately
directs Julie Christie in a gossa-
mer-winged sequence soaked with
fantasy. But it's beauty without
meaning - an artificial gloss try-
ing to transform a frothy confec-
tion into something substantial.
One of the film's more redeem-
ing qualities is the generous watt-
age of star power. Orlando Bloom
(the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy),
Natalie Portman ("V for Ven-
detta"), Ethan Hawke ("Training

"Paris" assumes the humble task
of discretely segmenting each
component of the city, "New York"
tries to join all these segments into
a cohesive narrative. And that's
the problem. For one, it's difficult
to tell when one story ends and
the other starts, and the brain
constantly has to make leaps into
previous memories to remember
who each character is. For another,
these efforts at cohesiveness limit
the individual creative visions of
each director.
The result is a group of largely
homogenized segments, none of
them revealing a true aspect of
New York's underbelly. Thus, it is
the ambition of "New York" that
is ultimately its downfall. "Paris"
achieved cohesionbecause it wasn't
looking for it; "New York" fails to
because it's so contrived.
Still, the benefit of having
11 short segments is that the
film never gets boring. As
with any anthology project,
the bad parts end quickly,
and the good ones end too
soon. Thankfully, the strong
segments still outnumber the
weaker ones. Director Brett Rat-
ner ("X-Men: The Last Stand"),
of all people, gives a surprisingly
funny and touching segment of
a boy taking a paraplegic girl to
prom after his leggy girlfriend
dumps him. Hawke, still charming
at 38, tries to woo a young sophis-
ticate during an intimate cigarette
break. And Portman helms a cute
yet unsubstantial passage about
a little girl and her male nanny in
her directorial debut.
Carefully toeingthe lineofmedi-
ocrity, "New York, I Love You" is a
difficult film to classify - it's not
great, not awful, but at least it's
never boring. For those featured
directors starving for more public
recognition, it's a good jumping-
off point. And for people who come
into the film with no expectations,
a couple segments might just stand
out. In terms of accomplishing its
goal, though, "New York" drasti-
cally fails.

Day"), Julie Christie ("Away From
Her"), Cloris Leachman ("Young
Frankenstein") Rachel Bilson
(TV's "The O.C.") and - with a
rather atrocious Russian accent
that screams anachronism - Shia
LaBeouf ("Transformers") round
out the impressive cast. Yet even
this quality is skin-deep, as it fea-
tures beautiful, white actors play-
ing beautiful, white roles. There
is certainly an attempt at diver-
sity, but it comes off as stereotype
(Indian as diamond peddler, Chi-
nese as herbalist, etc.).
It's impossible to assess the film

decessor, "Paris, je t'aime." While

lific recording career.
In addition to showcasing doz-
ens of Jackson's most beloved
musical numbers; "This Is It"
offers a unique image of Jackson
as a knowledgeable studio musi-
cian and a superstar willing to
share the stage. "Make it sim-
mer," he tells his piano player dur-
ing a rehearsal of "Jam." For the
famous guitar solo on "Beat It,"
he offers a center-stage position
to guitarist Orianthi Panagaris,
provided she can hit the highest
possible note on the instrument,
adding the performance will be
her "time to shine" when the con-
certs get underway.
Throughout the film, Jackson is
accompanied onstage by a caval-
cade of young, backflipping back-

up dancers who try to keep up
with Jackson's steps, contorting
their faces into scowls of unbro-
ken concentration. Meanwhile,
a skinny 50-year-old man eight
weeks short of death performs his
signature dance moves in a wind-
breaker and track pants, making
those backup dancers look posi-
tively foolish.
But it's Jackson's nonchalance
which makes "This Is It" so
astounding. Jackson occasion-
ally reminds his director that he
has to preserve his voice for the
sake of clarity, yet ignores his
own advice, delivering a spir-
ited, heartfelt performance of
"I Just Can't Stop Loving You"
after being impressed with his
female counterpart's rendition
of her part. He shouts in excite-
ment when the platform under
his feet lifts him high into the air.
His director begs him to hold on
to the platform's provided hand-

rails; instead Jackson throws
his hands above his head with a
smile.
The film closes with Jackson
performing a live sound check of
"Man in the Mirror." As Jackson
energetically belts out his song,
the camera pans left to reveal an
auditorium entirely empty save
for a few stagehands and backup
dancers on their lunch break.
While the film is unremittingly
entertaining, perhaps its finest
impact is that it doesn't leave the
viewer with a sense of loss. The
film is hardly polished, providing
merely a fraction of the product
that would've been delivered had
Jackson lived to perform the can-
celed tour. But it still proves that
Jackson remained as incalculably
talented as he ever was.
"This Is It" might not be the
farewell that Jackson envisioned,
but it is one his fans will surely
celebrate.

'Declaration' of Nordic desolation

 KINGS
From Page 5
Riot on an Empty Street. The acoustic guitar strum-
ming is pleasant, and Oye and Boe's voices effortlessly
blend to form swirling harmonies, but sometimes the
sound is too airy, with nothing there to bring it down
to earth.
Perhaps drums or electric beats could have ground-
ed the music, but Kings go at it alone, with nothing but
acoustic guitars and the occasional violin. The typi-
cally hazy and clich6 lyrics ("Freedom, freedom never
greater than its owner / Freedom is the mastery of the
known") do nothing to help focus the music. While
 Oye and Boe's foreignness to English manifests itself
nicely in their clipped, cautious and vaguely accented
delivery, it's hard not to snicker when they tell a girl,
"Ooh, there's a little bit of me in you" on the aptly
titled "Me in You."
Declaration has its moments. With lush violin

accents and thumping, folky guitar chords backing
a concisely no-frills melody, "Boat Behind" is tailor-
made for a sad rainy day, an unpretentious lament
that "Oh, whoa whoa / I can neverbelong to you." And
"Riot on an Empty Street" actually brings to mind a
desolate Nick Drake rumination. "It's a dangerous
game that I'm not sure if I could keep playing for long"
- as Oye and Bee hum the guitar part over a repeated
piano ostinato, listeners are left to wonder: are they
talking about life or music?
Perhaps the most endearing thing about Declara-
tion of Dependence is the raw production. From the
guitar squeaks to the breathing to the soft sound of
0ye and Boe's mouths opening to sing, every detail
of Declaration is here on record. It's a stark contrast
with today's overproduced pop music - a nod to the
past, when artists like Simon & Garfunkel brought
a delicate, acoustic vibe to rock music. True, it's too
placid and chilled-out for today's Top 40. But in the
right situation, Declaration ofDependence provides a
laid-back, dependable sonic environment that won't
disappoint.

There's something you can do.,

ing it up," Bonchi said. "There were
strangers getting involved trying
to break it up."
LSA sophomore MonicaKusaka
was also walking down the street
and said she saw at least five peo-
ple physically hurting the victim
before two guys picked him up
and carried him to the nearest
porch.
"There was a huge crowd stand-
ing around," Kusaka said. "By the
time I got there, they were carry-
ing him away."
Bonchi said she couldn't see
much because it was dark, but that
the victim "looked pretty bad" and
appeared unconscious.

The victim was placed on the
porch of house number 547, which
Krishnan said is currently vacant.
No one answered the door at the
residence Sunday night.
LSA sophomore Jamie Bloom
lives in house 541- directly on the
left of the house where the victim
was placed after the attack. Bloom
said he and his roommates were not
home when the incident occurred,
but heard people had knocked on
their door wondering if they knew
the victim.
Lance said the block party broke
up after the incident and that no
one else was harmed.
"We didn't take any real action
out there," he said. "People pretty
much after that went elsewhere to
other areas."

controlling that secondary flow of
water from the dam into the head-
race.
Community members, includ-
ing the Michigan Men's Club
Rowing Team - which uses Argo
Pond to practice - expressed
concern when the possibility of
closing the dam was presented in
September.
Other individuals and orga-
nizations, like the Huron River
Watershed Council, advocated for
the dam's removal, citing environ-
mental concerns.
City Councilmember Sabra Bri-
ere (D-Ward 1) said in an inter-
view yesterday that the agreement
was a step in the right direction

because it helped satisfythe state's
requirements.
"It's not at all about whether the
dam should be in or out, that's a
bigger problem that we aren't try-
ing to solve right now," she said.
"What we are trying to do is make
a compromise with the state."
Briere added that this is the
result with the lowest cost pos-
sible, which makes it a good com-
promise for the city.
She said city officials hope the
stop log blocking the embankment
is just a "temporary, winter-long
setback" and that the plan is for
the area to be back to regular use
for next year.
"We think we'll be able to turn
this around and give them solid
evidence that we're right before

spring," she said. "I think that will
be satisfactory to everybody."
The city hired a consultant
to provide tests to DEQ, which
it hopes will demonstrate there
isn't a problem with the headrace
where state officials had cited con-
cerns about the embankment. Bri-
ere said those results are expected
by mid-December, but that the
headrace will remain closed in the
interim.
Briere said removing the dam
would be "a lot more expensive
than people think," but that keep-
ing the dam in place would also
have a lot of costs. She stressed the
importance of taking the time to
make an informed decision, par-
ticularly because of the current,
difficult economic times.

"But there will be people who
want us to act more quickly, reach
a conclusion on the river more
swiftly," she said.
Additionally, Anglin said the
financial burden of jumping into
dam removal is difficult to assess,
and if the project were to begin,
there would be "no turning back if
the river takes a different course
(or) if the sediment under the pond
has (harmful) chemicals."
A timeline for when a final deci-
sion will be made has not been set,
Briere added.
Briere also said the health of the
river is something the city must
take into consideration in addi-
tion to recreational concerns, like
whether or not the University's
rowing team can use Argo Pond.

THE UNIVERSITY of MICHIGAN COLLEGE of LITERATURE, SCIENCE &
THE ARTS presents a public lecture and reception

Roberts explained that the state
controls 90 percent of the district's
funding. Over the past two weeks,
the state has reduced this year's
funding by $525 per pupil. Roberts
anticipates additional cuts of more
than $600 per student for the 2010-
2011 school year.
Roberts said the millage would
help to compensate for some of
those losses.
"All of those things combined
point to the need to raise additional
revenue," Roberts said.
He added that the millage alone
'would not eliminate budget issues.
Even if it passes, the district will
continue to reduce costs and con-
solidate services, Roberts said. But
if the millage doesn't pass, Roberts
believes the district will face major
reductions.
Roberts said the largest reduc-
tions would take place among staff,
since 85 percent of the district's
funds go toward compensating
employees.
The millage proposal faces sig-
nificant opposition from several
groups, two of which - Citizens for
a Responsible Washtenaw and Ann
Arbor Citizens for Responsible
School Spending - pulled together
locally based campaigns over the
past several weeks.

ber of A2CRSS and self-described

KOONCE
From Page 1
described Koonce as a close friend.
"That was his life."
Katherine McCartney, an aca-
demic advisor who worked closely
with Koonce, said he had a particu-
larly special relationship with the
University because it was not only
his workplace, but his alma mater.
Koonce received his Master of
Arts degree in higher education
administration at the University in
1990 and was working towards his
Ph.D., butdidn't complete his disser-
tation. He returned to the Univer-
sity of Michigan in November 2004
after working at a variety of colleges
including Union College, the Univer-
sity of Maryland, Tulane University
and the University of Pennsylvania.
During his time at Tulane,
Koonce, who at the time was the
football team's academic counselor,
got to know then-assistant coach
Rich Rodriguez.
At his weekly press conference
yesterday, Rodriguez discussed the
passing of his good friend.
In response to a question about the
football team needing one more win
to become eligible for a bowl game,
Rodriguez brought up Koonce's sud-
den passing.
"It's not life-or-death," Rodriguez
said of getting that sixth win. "It's a
ballgame and it's an important ball-
game, and as important as it is to

top priorities include fixing the
city's budget issues and re-zoning
the city to "encourage reasonable
new growth downtown," saying
that Elhady "opposes a sensible
strategy for downtown develop-
ment."
Briere, a candidate in the 1st
Ward, the other contested seat in
the elections, said she hopes to get
students more involved with the
city government, whether they
plan on residing in Ann Arbor just
during their education at the Uni-
versity or for their entire lives.
"The students forget that they
are also residents," she said. "They
focus so much on being residents of
the University that they forget they
have the rights of residents of the
community as well."
Briere also said she hopes stu-
dents can look to City Council
members to help them learn their
volunteer" in Ann Arbor. Two of
her children currently attend Ann
Arbor public schools.
Her group includes several for-
mer school board members and
focuses on irresponsible spending.
Wardner said she's disappointed
with the AAPS's handling of bud-
get issues.
"(AAPS) don't seem to be willing
to look at other solutions - every-
thing from cutting administration
to consolidating districts and ser-
vices," Wardner said.
Though Wardner said she's
largely pleased with AAPS teach-
ers and administrators, "there's
something inherently wrong with
how the whole structural thing is
set up."
She cited what she considers the.
district's over-reliance on taxpayer
money.
"There's a lot of issues and I feel
like their answer is, 'Give us the
money and we'll take the next five
years to fix the problem,"'"Wardner
said, "And my answer is, 'You've
already had five years. Why should
I give you money for another
five?"
Albert Berriz serves as trea-
surer of CRW, a group allied with
A2CRSS. He is the CEO of McKin-
ley, a locally based real estate
investment and management com-
pany. Berrizsaid hisugroup includes
mostly business people and also
targets irresponsible spending.
The group proposed a "five-point
plan for (district) transformational
change," according to Berriz.
everybody out there, I promise you,
it's more important to the program
and the guys in the program than
anybody. It's still just a game.
"I think things come to life when
we get the news yesterday that we
lost a dear friend, Rob Koonce," he
continued.
Rodriguez discussed how he got
to know Koonce at Tulane and how
Koonce has helped with recruitment
efforts since Rodriguez has arrived
in Ann Arbor.
"He was my age, a little younger,
and it's tragic for his family," Rodri-
guez said. "Certainly all the guys on
our team, a lot of them knew him.
Our staff all knew Rob, and our
thoughts and prayers are with him
and his family."
"Butthat putthings in light.We're
playing a game."
Koonce will be remembered as an
integral part of the Ross School of
Business - someone who went far
above his role as an advisor, helping

to facilitate a connection between
the University's business commu-
nity and the larger community as a
whole.
Dean of Business Bob Dolan said
Robert Koonce "was a real commu-
nity-builder."
"I think every day he was always
trying to do things to help members
of the community, whether he had
a formal responsibility to do so or
not," Dolan said.
Ryen Speed, a student in the
Master of Accounting program who
got to know Koonce well, said in

rights and understand legal issues
common among college students.
"Students don't think about how
they are treated by the police, how
they are treated as adultswithin the
community and how to deal with
beinga resident when they happen
to be arrested," Briere said.
Briere's opponent, Ozog, said he
has special interest in helping the
homeless and in public education,
noting he has children enrolled in
Ann Arbor public schools.
Ozog, who is a Polish native,
also emphasized the importance
of bringing people from differ-
ent backgrounds and cultures into
the conversation. He said that if
elected, he would work to converse
daily with people with different
perspectives and bring that knowl-
edge to the council discussions.
Apart from the two contested
seats, three wards have candidates
"Our program has not been to
say 'vote no' because we don't like
it, but to give a substantive solution
to the issue," Berriz said.
He said the CRW has produced
alternatives that don't require
taxing residents in a state whose
unemployment rate is about 15
percent.
"I don't think it's fair to go to the
community in this economy with-
out having done the responsible
spending and having addressed
those issues," Berriz said.
According to Berriz, his group's
goal transcends political party
affiliation.
"On both sides I think people are
truly concerned with how we fund
the public school system on a sus-
tainable basis," Berriz said.
Berriz also emphasized the
potential impact the millage's pas-
sage could have on University stu-
dent tenants.
A property tax increase, accord-
ing to Berriz, would mean higher
rentals for student tenants because
landlords would be forced to pass
the tax on to their renters.
That potential consequence,
Berriz said, is one reason why the
Washtenaw AreaApartment Associ-
ation came out against the millage.
Berriz said the WAAA planned
to distribute fliers at a housing fair
yesterday explaining the conse-
quences of the millage tax on stu-
dents should it pass.
"Itwill reflectin adirectincrease
in their rent," Berriz said.

an e-mail that Koonce appreciated
everything Michigan, from athletics
to Greek Life and every organization
in between.
"He always knew who was
involved in which organizations,"he
said in the e-mail.
In the spring of 2006, Koonce
launched a high school outreach
program called MREACH to forge
a relationship between the Ross

schools in Detroit and Ypsilanti.
Eddie Hall, a student in the Mas-

MREACH program coordinator,
said Koonce "had a phenomenal
impact on both high school students
and college students."
Koonce was also an instrumental
part of the Preparation Initiative, a
program that offers counseling and
tutoring in economics, math and
accounting to University students
interested in applying to Ross at the
end of their freshman year.

"We will all do our best to carry
on the great programs that he start-
ed for us and we will miss his leader-
ship," Dolan said.
In addition to creating essential
programs for Ross, Koonce was
known as a vital resource for stu-
dents seeking advice.
McCartney said she received
countless e-mails from alumni and
current students who had heard of
his death that expressed how impor-
tant Koonce was to them.

Councilmember Stephen Kunsel-

Rapundalo said his biggest focus
on the council next term is going to
be the city's budget, making sure
the city balances its books "with-
out really impacting city services
too much, if at all."
Kunselman, like Elhady, high-
lighted the importance of main-

between City Council and the Uni-

"In terms of this era, it brings

tive director, said that a consider-

She said the millage's passage
would increase the cost of renting
apartments in Ann Arbor because
of the increase in property taxes.
"I would think students should
be concerned if their rent is going
up or not," Ehn said.
Nevertheless, the University's
chapter of the College Democrats
have come out in favor of the mill-
age.
According to the group's chair,
Sam Marvin, the millage's ben-
efits outweigh the potential rent
increase.
Marvin said the Democrats are
allied with "It Takes a Millage," a
local pro-millage group, and sup-
port its objective.
"This millage would work to
close the funding gap so (AAPS)
doesn't have to cut programs like
art, science, music and sports,"
Marvin said.
The College Democrats delivered
pro-millage literature in several stu-
dent neighborhoods Monday night
and spent much of yesterday dis-
tributing information on the Diag.
Additionally, the group put up fliers,
made phone calls and sent text mes-
sages urging students to vote yes on
the initiative, Marvin said.
Marvin added that even if he did
pay property taxes, he'd still sup-
port the millage. "I wouldn't mind
paying higher rent. I'm sure some
people would, but I think the situa-

"He was the kind of person who if

was in his power to help," Hall said.
"He has always wanted and encour-
aged his students to be the best they
can be. He was hard on us, but it was
a tough love kind of thing."
Evette Hollins, a University alum,
worked closely with Koonce during
her freshman year when she was in
the process of applying to the Busi-
ness School.
Hollins said Koonce was an espe-
cially caring ally for minority stu-
dents in the Business School.
"He understood that we were
under-represented and he did every-
thing in his power to help us excel,"
she said in an e-mail.

"I will continue to work hard for

Speed emphasized Koonce's

On Friday,§'Mhas chance to
prove it belongs in spotlight

Before too much is made
of the Michigan hockey
team's pair of wins
against Lake Superior State last
weekend, just remember who
comes to town on Friday.
That's right - No. 1 Miami
(Ohio).
While the 5-1 and 6-3 victories
in Sault Ste. Marie are nice, they
will be quickly forgotten if the
success can't
be duplicated NICK
against the
RedHawks. SPAR
"This will On ice hockey
be a good test
for us, just to
see where we are," Michigan
coach Red Berenson said. "If
you have any chance of finishing
ahead of a team in this league,
then you have to win the series
against them ... These games will
decide the order of finish down
the road."
But for No. 4 Michigan, this
weekend is about more than just
end-of-the-season conference
standings. It's a chance to gain
confidence against the best of
the best and an opportunity to
answer questions that have lin-
gered for the first month of the
season.
For instance, will the Wolver-
ines even show up for three full
periods?
They entered Friday's con-
test against the Lakers with an
offense prone to long, dormant
stretches. It had been held score-
less in four of its previous six
frames and on its previous 10
power plays.
And despite the 11 tallies on
the weekend, the inconsistency
continued. This was especially
true on Saturday, when after one
period, Lake Superior State had
doubled Michigan's shot total.
Whether Michigan maintains
focus for the full 60 minutes will
be answered on the scoreboard
at the end of each game.
The Wolverines are talented
enough to beat Lake Superior
State after taking a period off -
but not enough to beat the Red-.
Hawks.
"We just gotta get the job

ARIEL BOND/Daily
Sophomore Luke Glendening and the Wolverines dropped their only game against a
ranked team this year, 2-1, at Boston University. They play No.1 Miami (Ohio) Friday.

off field for solutions

done," freshman forward Chris
Brown said. "Miami is not going
to give us just two periods.
They're going to make us play all
three."
Another looming question
is whether the Wolverines
can limit the neutral zone and
offensive zone turnovers, which
would provide a big lift for goalie
Bryan Hogan and the defense-
men. The miscues haven't led
to many goals on the other end,
but it's a good bet that they will
against the highest-ranked team
in the nation.
"A turnover happens because
I've got the puck and I make a
mistake - I force it into traffic
or I try to beat a guy one-on-one
and he strips me and goes the
other way," Berenson said. "So
part of your defense is what you
do when you have the puck."
Limiting these unnecessary
turnovers will pay dividends
threefold. Pressure will be sus-
tained in the offensive zone
instead of Michigan's, fewer
odd-man rushes will occur and
fewer penalties will be taken in
an attempt to recover from the
turnover.
If mistakes leading to chances
for the opponent are trimmed,
other teams will have a tough

time controlling the tempo of
the game and pushing pucks past
Hogan. And that includes the
RedHawks.
The final question, and the
most important one, is whether
the Wolverines can make a state-
ment and gain much-needed
momentum as they head into the
meat of the CCHA schedule.
Michigan already had a
chance to knock off defending
champion Boston University.
But that game was in the
rowdy Agganis Arena in Bos-
ton, and it was settled by a rare
Hogan blunder behind the net
with 2:30 left.
This is different. It looks
like Berenson has finally found
offensive line combinations that
clicked. The defense has jelled
almost perfectly, especially on
the penalty kill. Hogan is begin-
ning to find a rhythm. And this
time, the RedHawks will have
the hostile Yost Ice Arena crowd
to contend with.
Really, there's no better time
for Michigan to answer these
questions, garner its first win
over a ranked team, and prove
itself worthy of its top-five rank.
After all, home games against
the nation's top team aren't
exactly easy to come by.

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor
After two consecutive defensive
collapses, the Michigan football
team is looking for an answer. Any
answer.
It's a time when many want to
write the Wolverines off, giving
them a slim chance to even make a
bowl. But accord-
ing to junior cor- NOTEBOOK
nerback Donovan
Warren, the answer to the Wolver-
ines' woes isn't schematic or overly
technical - it has to come from
within.
"You've got to take a look in the
mirror and ask yourself, 'Are you
doing everything that is possible to
make this team better?' " Warren
said. "I feel like some guys just need
to take a look in the mirror, includ-
ing myself and including everyone
on the team. Everyone from the
trainers, to the weightroom coach-
es, everyone, just take a look in the
mirror and come to work."
This season, Warren has done
his share on the field to make the
Wolverines a better team and give
the increasingly weak secondary a
chance. His pass coverage, the best
on the team, is third-best in the Big
Ten with 10 pass breakups. He is
also tied for fifth with three inter-
ceptions.
But Warren said yesterday it's
off-the-field things that he and
seniors Stevie Brown and Brandon
Graham will do to motivate their
teammates and lead the young
defense out of its slump.
Graham said he planned to
address the team during yester-
day's practice. The defensive end's
speech was set to include seizing
the opportunity to play in a bowl
game, ignoring distractions and

how at this point in the season,
the product is less about effort and
more about heart.
"They really tune into those
breaks at practice, especially when
their teammates are talking," Gra-
ham said. "They going to listen to
what I got to say or any senior got
to say because (Michigan coach
Rich Rodriguez) always calls on
the seniors to break down the hud-
dle and someone's always giving a
speech."
Graham's words will need to be
pretty strong to compensate for the
Wolverines' recent defensive short
fallings. Rodriguez said yesterday
that the defensive effort has been
there, but'it's.more of an issue of
overthinking plays and playing
"tight" and nervously. He named
Graham as one player who hasn't
fallen victim to those problems.
"He makes mistakes, but he
plays at a high level all the time,"
Rodriguez said of Graham. "And
he makes a lot of plays, because
he's an experienced guy, and he's
been there, and he lets it loose..Very
simple."
It seems simple for Graham now.
He has been one of Michigan's best
playmakers all year and moved
into second place on the Michigan
career list for sacks (25) during the
Illinois game. His blocked punt
against the Illini in the final min-
utes of the Wolverines' demoraliz-
ing38-13 loss exemplified Graham's
work ethic.
He is trying to motivate his
teammates the best he can on the
field and off, but it doesn't take
the senior long to put himself in
his younger teammates' shoes and
remember what it was once like.
"You just get nervous just being
out there on the field for the first
time," Graham said. "That second

year still, you just kind of nervous
because you want to make sure
everything is just right. You want to
make sure you hold up your end.
"It comes in time, and I believe
they'll end up playing looser soon-
er."
And even though Rodriguez
praised Graham's fluid play, the
senior quickly admitted he still gets
just as jittery before games as he
did in his first year.
"Before games, I always think
about what I'm goingto say because
I'll be nervous, just as nervous as
everybody else, before tht irst
hit," he said.
PRESIDENT'S SUPPORT: Uni-
versity President MarySue Cole-
man gave Rodriguez a vote of
confidence in an interview with the
Wall Street Journal last weekend.
In light of Rodriguez's recent
struggles, Coleman told the Journal
she didn't "think it's fair to coaches
to bring them in and say, 'We're
going to give you three years."'
"Mary Sue has been very sup-
portive," Rodriguez said. "Just
about every week, she'll send a note.
We talked a couple weeks ago very
briefly. Everybody has been sup-
portive. I mean, I want everybody
to have patience. I don't have much
of it, but I wish our players would
have patience."
INJURY UPDATE: Rodriguez
said yesterday that senior tailback
Brandon Minor continues to battle
a high ankle sprain and is day-to-
day. Minor has been limited during
practices for much of this season,
and Rodriguez said he felt that the
injury will continue to be an issue.
... Defensive lineman Greg Banks
suffered a foot sprain against Illi-
nois and will be limited this week.
... Slot receiver Martavious Odoms
(knee) is also day-to-day.

Madden leads Wolverines
at conference tournament

Junior falls short in
Big Ten finals
By ZELL ZOERHOF
For The Daily
After coming off a sophomore
season where he was named the
team's most improved player,
junior Chris Madden made a deep
run to the championship finals of
the Big Ten Individual men's ten-
nis tournament held Oct. 30- Nov.
2. He won his first four matches in
straight sets with ease, and his play
improved with every match. Then,
in a match against Indiana's Santi-
ago Gruter, he found himself down
5-1 in the second set tiebreaker after
already dropping the first 2-6.
"I waited for my opportunity,"
Madden said. "I swung out, and
when I got a chance, I took it."
Though Madden went on to lose
in the final, his play never lacked
excitement. Madden hit four win-
ners in what was left in the breaker,

water at the World Championships
and staying up there with guys I've
read about winning gold and silver
medals at the Olympics, when I defi-
nitely realized, 'Wow, I can actually
do this."'
He may have just realized it,
but it's really no surprise. Madwed
started swimming at 10 when his
mother signed him up for the swim
team to keep him busy during the
summer. And it wasn't long before
he realized how good he really was.
At age 12, in Connecticut, he
started breaking state records and
qualifying for regional swim meets.
Madwed said at that age, he didn't
care about records or qualifying
times, but enjoyed racing. Without
fully knowing it, he was already on a
fast track to national and even inter-
national success.
At 15, he qualified for the 2004
U.S. Olympic Trials. He didn't make
the team, but the experience gave
him a new perspective on the sport
and helped him set new goals.
"I was really inexperienced going
into the 2004 Olympic trials," Mad-
wed said. "I went out swimming as
hard as I could and I just died. A
while after, I started looking ahead
to the 2008 Olympics. By 2006, I
was third in the country in 200-
meter butterfly and thought, maybe
I could make this happen."
There was only one problem-
Madwed was running out of people
who could challenge him in the pool.
He was consistently beating every-
one at practice and needed faster
teammates to train with to take him
to the next level. After talking with
several coaches and some friends
on a national junior team training

south with him. His new teammates
and coaches in Baltimore provided
him a more competitive training
environment.
"Everyone wanted to know who
the kid was that moved his senior
year of high school just to swim, so I
made friends pretty quickly," Mad-
wed said. "Plus, it was pretty fun
living with my grandparents. My
grandma volunteers and my grand-
pa entertains at old-age homes. I
know that's ironic, but it was a good
experience."
His move to North Baltimore
clearly paid off during his freshman
year at Michigan, where he made his
mark quickly. Madwed placed 12th
at the NCAA Championships in the
200-yard freestyle, finished as a two-
time individual Big Ten Champion
and earned All-Big Ten first team
honors. The engineering major puts
in long hours training with the team
and in the classroom. His coaches
say he's never satisfied and routinely
looks for ways to get faster.
But Madwed isn't just one of the
hardest workers on the team, he's
one of the happiest.
"He's got a great sense of humor.
He enjoys himself while he does
everything, and I think that's a rare
characteristic," Michigan assistant
coach Dr. Josh White said. "It's
really interesting to see how hard he
works but he doesn't carry a grudge
about it."
This season, Madwed says his
goal is to help the Wolverines repeat
as Big Ten Champions and finish in
the top four at the NCAAs.
And if the summer taught us
anything about him, it's expect the
unexpected.

The Michigan women's soccer
team earned its first Big Ten win of
the year against Illinois on Sunday
thanks to a standout performance
from redshirt freshman goalie

the 74th minute that gave the Wol-
verines a -

the heels
of a 2-1loss on Friday against Iowa
(1-7-0 Big Ten, 9-9-0 overall) in
Iowa City, which was the latest in
a frustrating run of ties and close
losses.
Michigan won despite being
outshot by Illinois 21-4, which
forced Kopmeyer to make a career
high 11 saves. The shutout was her
sixth of the season, a record for
Michigan rookie goaltenders.
It's easy to point to Michigan's
shot disadvantage against Illinois
(2-5-2, 7-8-3) and its 300-148 shot
disadvantage over the course of
the season as a sign that the team
is lacking in talent. Michigan
coach Greg Ryan knows this is
partly true, since injuries and the
dismissal of a few players forced
the Wolverines to have just 6.2 of
their allotted 14 scholarships out
on the field this weekend. With
the lack of depth, the team has
struggled in the offensive zone all
year.

But Ryan notes that the shot
deficit is also in part by design.
"We use a defensive scheme
where the back line drops and
doesn't allow anything behind
them, forcing the other team to
take low-percentage shots outside
the box," he said. "Kopmeyer is
so rangy. She doesn't have a lot of
trouble with those."
Even with that massive shot dis-
advantage, Michigan (1-3-5, 6-8-5)
has been outscored just 25-20 this
year.
"It's a common strategy around
the world," Ryan said. "Teams
with less offensive talent have to
compensate for it. We drop the
back line, don't allow great chanc-
es, and counter-attack when we
can. Soccer's not about how many
shots you have it's about how many
solid chances you get, and the way
we play is all about that."
Senior midfielder Alex Jen-
drusch's game-winning goal came
off a cross from junior defender
Amanda Bowery in the 74th min-
ute. It was her fourth goal of the
season, which made her the team
leader in goals.
"If you had told me last year that
Jendrusch would be our leading
scorer, I would have bet the farm
against it," Ryan said. "She's made
so much progress since then. If
I had to pick the best example of
a player whose development the
younger ones should try to emu-
late, it'd be her."
The Wolverines weren't as suc-
cessful on Friday against Iowa.
Sophomore Kristen Goncalves
scored on a breakaway 15 minutes
into the game to tie the game at
one, but the Hawkeyes scored on a
shot from 25 yards out in the 64th
minute to steal the deal.
It was a tight, defensive game
where Kopmeyer was again
impressive, making six saves,

The Michigan men's soccer
team has even more to celebrate
after its season-saving upset of
No. 12 Northwestern last week-
end.
Today, the BigTen announced
that Michigan redshirt sopho-
more goalie Chris Blais and
redshirt junior forward Matt
Schmitt were named Big Ten
Defensive Player of the Week
and Big Ten Offensive Player of
the Week, respectively.
The awards are well-timed, as
the Wolverines' victory over the
Wildcats could propel the team
into postseason play.
"We needed this win, and we
need next week's win," Blais said
after the game. "It was a must-
win for all of us if we want to
make the NCAA Tournament, so
I think that's where the intensity

came from."
AccordingtotheMichiganAth-
letic Department press release,
this marks the first time the Wol-
verines have claimed both awards
sinceformergoalie PatrickSperry
and former forward Jake Stacy
wononOct. 6,2008.
Blais recorded four saves in
his sixth shutout of the year, and
Schmitt scored the game's lone
goal to preserve the win.
Schmitt's award comes after
the Muskegon native has battled
back from a sports hernia injury
sustained in the offseason. He's
finally hitting his stride, scoring
his first and second goals of the
year in the Wolverines' last two
games.
Michigan's regular-season
finale is this Saturday against
Ohio State in Columbus.

including a couple of very diffi-
cult ones. According to Ryan, the
defense played very well overall,
but a few defensive lapses cost the
Wolverines the game. Ryan said
there was a lack of pressure on the
ball before the second goal, some-
thing the Michigan defense nor-
mally does well.
"Other than that, it was just a
great shot right in the corner," he
said. "There was nothing Kopmey-
er could do about it."
The Wolverines play just one
more game this season, against
Penn State on Nov. 8. A Big Ten
championship might be out of

reach, but despite the team's medi-
ocre record, the season was one of

face of many problems in the last

beginning to use all of its allotted
scholarships.
But this year, Michigan has
shown great resilience. It was
proven that it can play against
quality competition, forcing five
ties against Big Ten opponents
and suffering several close loss-
es.
And that is an important step
for the program asuit seeks to climb
the Big Ten ladder in the future.
