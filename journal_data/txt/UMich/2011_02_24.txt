President, VP for
Student Affairs
offer advice about

By KYLE SWANSON

"What do you have to offer for
students who don't know what
they want to do?"
This was one question posed
to University President Mary Sue
Coleman yes-
terduy at the
president's r
monthly

- an invita-
tion event in
which stu-

questions Covering the

pus issues.
The event was sparsely
attended yesterday - only 16
students attended the discus-
sion, compared to the normal
crowd of 40 - but the dialogue

was serious, with many students
voicingconcerns about how their
University degrees will translate
into careers.
Undergraduate and gradu-
ate students shared their con-
cerns with Coleman and Royster
Harper, the University's vice
president for student affairs,
at the event. Each provided a
slightly different story, but the
overall issue was clear - stu-
dents are unsure about how a
University degree translates into
a successful career that provides
financial independence and per-
sonal happiness.
One LSA freshman told Cole-
man he was worried about how
his degree 'would help him
secure a career since he feels
pressure to figure out what he
wants to do and then get a job in
that field.
"It's not really the reality, but
it's what people think," the stu-
dent said.
Coleman and Harper reas-
sured students they don't think
that's the case. Coleman added
that college is a time for explora-
tion.

Both Hockey, maple syrup and

merit (and not citizenship)."
Still, Kohli said the Canadian

of cultural exchange between his
motherland and adoptive country.
"We have already apologized for
Justin Bieber and more than made
amends with The Arcade 'Fire and

Newly released audio and

aftermath of a suspected gas
main explosion that leveled a
Detroit-area furniture store,
leaving two employees dead and
critically injuring the owner.
The recordings obtained by
The Associated Press through
a Freedom of Information Act
request include 911 calls, police

captured by cameras mounted to
police cars and inside a nearby

The video footage doesn't

gay marriages
Lawyers for two same-sex
couples again asked a federal
appeals court yesterday to allow
gay marriage to resume in Cali-
fornia while the court consid-

state's ban on same-sex unions.
The couples' attorneys filed a
motion asking the 9th U.S. Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals to lift the
stay it imposed in September on
a trial court ruling that struck
down the voter-approved ban
known as Proposition 8.
The request was prompted by
an "intolerable" delay created

otal legal question in the case -
whether Proposition 8 sponsors
have authority to challenge the
lower court's decision, lawyer
Theodore Olson said.

White House
mulling options to
stop violence
BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) -
The scope of Moammar Gad-
hafi's rule in Libya was whittled
away yesterday as major cities
and towns closer to the capital
fell into the hands of protesters
demanding his ouster. In Libya's
east, now allbut broken awaythe
opposition vowed to "liberate"
Tripoli, where the Libyan leader
is holed up with a force of militia-
men roaming the streets.
In a further sign of Gadhafi's
faltering hold, two air force pilots
- one from the leader's own
tribe - parachuted out of their
warplane and let it crash into the
deserts of eastern Libya, rather
than follow orders to bomb a
opposition-held city.
International momentum was
building for action to punish
Gadhafi's regime for the bloody
crackdown it has unleashed
against the week-old upris-
ing against his rule. The White
House said it is reviewing options
to compel Libya to stop violence,
including sanctions. French
President Nicolas Sarkozy raised
the possibility of the EU cutting
off economic ties.
"The violence is abhorrent, it
is completely unacceptable and
the bloodshed must stop," White
House spokesman Jay Carney
said in Washington.
Italy's Foreign Minister Fran-
co Frattini said estimates of some
1,000 people killed in the vio-
lence in Libya were "credible,"
althoughhe stressed information
about casualties was incomplete.
The New York-based Human
Rights Watch has put the death

toll at nearly 300, according to a
partial count.
In Tripoli, Gadhafi's strong-
hold, protest organizers were
calling for new rallies today and
Friday, raisingthe potential for a
new bloody confrontation.
Militiamen and Gadhafi sup-
porters - a mix of Libyans and
foreign African fighters bused
in - roamed the capital's main
streets, called up by the, Libyan
leader in a fist-pounding speech
the night before in which he
vowed to fight to the death. The
gunmen fired weapons in the air,
chanting "long live Gadhafi" and
waving green flags. With a steady
rain all day long, streets were
largely empty, residents said.
In many neighborhoods, resi-
dents set up watch groups to
keep militiamen out, barricad-
ing their streets with concrete
blocks, metal and rocks and
searching those trying to enter,
said a Tripoli activist.
Gadhafi's residence at Trip-
oli's Aziziya Gates was guarded
by loyalists along with a line of
armed militiamen in vehicles;
some masked, he said. The radio
station building downtown was
also heavily fortified. In one
western neighborhood, security
forces stormed several homes
and arrested three or four peo-
ple, a witnesses said.
"Mercenaries are everywhere
with weapons. You can't open
a window or door. Snipers hunt
people," said another resident,
who said she had spent the last
night in her home awake hearing
gunfire outside. "We are under
siege, at the mercy of a man who
is not a Muslim."
But below the surface, pro-
testers were organizing, said the
activist. At night, they fan out
and spray-paint anti-Gadhafi

graffiti or set fires near police
stations, chanting "the people
want the ouster of the regime,"
before running at the approach
of militiamen, he said. The Trip-
oli residents, like other witnesses
around the country, spoke on
condition of anonymity because
of fear of retaliation.
In opposition-controlled
Benghazi, the eastern city where
the uprising began on Feb. 17,
residents held a mass rally out-
side the city's main courthouse,
vowing to support protesters in
the capital, said Farag al-Warfali,
a local banker. They also called
a one-day fast in solidarity with
them. Afterward, young men
went into the courthouse to reg-
ister to obtain weapons, which
had been looted from police sta-
tions and military bases and then
turned over to the city's new rul-
ers, he said.
The idea is to "take their weap-
ons and march toward Tripoli,"
al-Warfali said - though Beng-
hazi lies 580 miles (940 kilo-
meters) east of the capital, and
territory stilloyal-to'Gadhafi lies
between them.
The extent ofGadhafi's control
over the country he has ruled for
41 years had been reduced to the
western coastal region around
Tripoli, the deserts to the south
and parts of the center.
Ater Gadhafi's speech Tuesday
night, militiamen flooded into
Sabratha, a town west of Tripoli
famed for nearby ancient Roman
ruins, and battled protesters who
had taken over, said one resident.
Around 5,000 militiamen from
neighboring towns, backed by
army and police units, clashed
with protesters and drove them
from the streets, he said.
But his territory was being
eroded.

After intense
fighting, dozens
wounded, 10 AU
troops killed
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)
- Somali militants said yester-'
day they had paraded the bodies
of five African Union peacekeep-
ers killed in fighting and also
were holding a soldier from
Burundi captive after intense
battles in the capital.
The fighting appeared to come
amid a major push in Mogadishu
by Somali troops and African
Union peacekeepers against the
militants. Heavy fighting had
broken out over the weekend
after AU troops ^ discovered a
trench used by militants to move
supplies and fighters in the capi-
tal.
The violence started yester-
day after AU peacekeepers and
Somali troops launched a dawn
attack on rebel positions, seiz-

ing the former Somalia Ministry
of Defense-building, which had
been servi9g as the militants'
base; according to Maj. Barigye
Bahoku,- spokesman for the AU
troops'
Bahok eclined to comment
on reports of heavy losses by the
AU troops.
An al-Shabab spokesman;
Sheik Ali Mohamud Rage, said
that militants had killed five
peacekeepers and captured one
alive. He said the militants had
paraded the bodies of the five
men.
A Nairobi-based diplomat who
quoted defense sources in Moga-
dishu said reports indicated that
up to 10 African Union troops
were killed and dozens were
wounded in yesterday's fighting.
The diplomat said he could not
be quoted by name because his
organization does not allow it.
Somalia's prime minister,
Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed,
said yesterday that government-
allied troops are expanding con-
trol of the capital.

er of a Cuban political prisoner
who died after a hunger strike,
and called on the government of
Raul Castro to release all dissi-
dents still behind bars.
Meanwhile, Cuban oppo-
sition leaders on the island
planned low-key protests to
mark the one-year anniversary
of the death of Orlando Zapata
Tamayo, who passed away on
Feb. 23, 2010 after an 83-day
hunger strike.
State Department spokes-
man P.J. Crowley joined a cho-
rus of international criticism
of Cuba for its treatment of
Zapata's mother, Reina Luisa
Tamayo, who was detained for
about 12 hours last week in her
hometown of Banes, in eastern
Cuba.
"Mr. Orlando Zapata
Tamayo's death highlights
the injustice of Cuba's deten-
tion of political prisoners who
should now be released without

delay," he said in a statement
from Washington yesterday.
He called Zapata a "courageous
humanitarian who died defend-
ing a universal human right -
freedom of expression."
Amnesty International
issued its own denunciation of
Cuba's treatment of Zapata's
mother on Tuesday.
Reached by telephone in
Banes, Reina Luisa Tamayo
said she spent the day laying
flowers and a Cuban flag on
her son's grave and then went
to get passport photos made
for a visa to the United States,
which has granted her political
refuge.
She said she plans to have
her son cremated and bring the
ashes when she departs Cuba
for good - expected to be in
the coming months, although
Tamayo recently said she was
still awaiting Cuban paper-
work.
Cuba had no comment on the
anniversary. The government
considers the dissidents to be
mercenaries paid by Washing-
ton to destabilize the country,
and says its doctors did every-
thing they could to keep Zapata
alive during his fast.
Since Zapata's death, the
government has cleared its jails
of many political prisoners. It
has freed 46 activists, intellec-

tuals and social commentators
arrested in a 2003 crackdown,
and now holds just six men
arrested in that sweep who are
considered "prisoners of con-
science" by Amnesty.
It has also freed about 25
other prisoners arrested sepa-
rately for violent - but politi-
cally motivated - crimes like
hijacking and sabotage. Eliz-
ardo Sanchez, a prominent
human rights activist on the
island, says around 100 such
prisoners remain in Cuban jails,
some convicted of violent acts
including murder.
Members of the Ladies in
White, formed by the wives and
mothers of the 2003 detainees,
gathered at the Havana home
of Laura Pollan, one of the
opposition group's leaders, to
mark the anniversary of Zapa-
ta's death.
Associated Press reporters
saw a heavy police presence
on the streets outside Pollan's
home, perhaps in anticipation
of a march. But another Ladies
in White leader, Bertha Soler,
said the women had no plans to
emerge.
"All we wanted was to get
together and pay tribute to
Zapata;" she said. "We are pray-
ing, lighting candles and laying
flowers. For the moment, we
have no plans to march."

FROM THE DAILY
Setting up to fail
DPS should throw out school consolidation plan
Education isn't child's play. It's not a matter that can or should
be taken lightly. Apparently, Detroit hasn't gotten that mes-
sage. In a desperate attempt to reduce the deficit, the city is
considering a plan that would close down 70 of its public schools. If
the plan is implemented, high school class sizes will, greatly increase.
This is a terrible proposal that won't achieve the city's goal of ame-
liorating its dire fiscal situation. The city of Detroit and the state
Legislature need to look for ways to eliminate the deficit that won't
mortgage the city's future and leave children behind.

According to a Feb. 22 article in the Wall
Street Journal, Detroit Public Schools finan-
cial manager Robert Bobb submitted a plan to
the state Legislature that would allow DPS to
close half its schools and increase the average
high school class size to 60 students over the
course of four years. The plan is a final effort
to close the district's $327 million budget def-
icit and was approved by the Legislature on
Feb.8. If the plan is implemented, the number
of schools in the district will fall from 142 to
72, and enrollment could decrease by about
15,000 students.
Detroit is being set up to fail. In a city
where educational achievement and literacy
are already low, this severe budget cut could
be a kiss of death. The quality of education
will be compromised - in classrooms brim-
ming with students, teachers won't be able to
give each student the individual attention he
or she needs. At a time when the city should
be investing in its youth to prepare them
for higher education and an evolving and
increasingly competitive global economy,
students can't bear the brunt of =draconian
austerity measures.
It's also troubling that the plan presumes
a mass exodus of about 15,000 students. As if

the brain drain in Detroit - and in Michigan
as a whole - wasn't bad enough. DPS shut-
ting down so many schools provides another
incentive for people to leave the city. In the
end, Detroit's enormous budget cuts are
going to diminish its tax revenue and educat-
ed human capital. Ironically, so-called fiscal
responsibility will empty the city's pockets.
But Detroit shouldn't shoulder all of the
blame for these measures. The state Legis-
lature - which is, using some twisted logic,
concurrently implementing higher education
standards - approved the plan. If education
is really a priority for Michigan, it's time for
the Legislature to take a firm stand against
the "emergency" plan and consider some
alternatives that will benefit the state as a
whole.
President Barack Obama made education
a theme in his State of the Union address,
even explicitly calling for more teachers and
a greater emphasis on learning. Michigan
would do well to listen to him - Bobb's plan
shouldn't even be a last resort. A city that
can raise more than $50,000 for a Robocop
statue should find a way to raise funds for its
schools. The Legislature literally can't afford
to have a myopic vision for the state's future.

Im sick of people bemoaning
student apathy. I'm also sick
of people invoking a roman-
ticized picture
of the 1960s to
promote a vision
of what today's
student activ-
ism should look
like. Whenever
we collectively
adapt a distorted
view of history, JEREMY
it impedes our LEVY
ability to under-
stand present
problems.
During my time at The Michigan
Daily, student apathy has come up
as a cause of concern from many
sources. When I was on the edito-
rial board, we frequently criticized
apathy in editorials regarding
government elections, the United
States Census or any issue where it
was remotely relevant. Not that stu-
dents shouldn't fill out their Census
or vote, but whenever such issues
came up, someone had to remind
us of the way the University was in
the 60s, back in the days when Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society was
prominent and the Daily was most
relevant. I recall a Daily alum tell-
ing the staff that reporters should
put more energy into reporting and
follow the lead of a Daily reporter
who, in the 60s, dug through trash
outside the Fleming Administra-
tion Building to see if he could find
any confidential papers from the
Office of the President.-
ADaily column by Matthew Green
(Bring activism back, 12/8/10) serves
as a good example of the way many
like to frame the 60s. Unlike today,
the 60s was the period of the Peace
Corps, the Great Society and protests
sparked by the SDS. But given that
our political problems today resem-
ble those of the 60s, Green's narra-

tive illustrates, it's only fitting that
student activism see a revival, even if,
in a less radical form.
But our typical view of how stu-
dent protests became so prominent
by 1969 is oversimplified and distort-
ed. First of all, the SDS didn't just rise
out of a fervor of pure idealism - it
was largely a response to the Cuban
Missile Crisis, an event that made
University students like SDS founder
Tom Hayden realize how close the
U.S. and Soviet Union came to start-
ing a nuclear war.
Next,acloserlookatthel1962"Port
Huron Statement" by Hayden shows
that the SDS didn't immediately have
the support of students nationwide
- the SDS criticized students of the
time for their apathy and consum-
erism. It wasn't until the draft, the
giant American death count that
dwarfed that of our current wars and
the U.S. brutality in Vietnam - as
depicted by the media - that student
protests really took off.
There's a consistent notion that
students today are underperforming
in comparison to their predecessors.
Whathistory can teachus inthis sce-
nario is thatthe tendencytoward low
student participation in civic activity
today is the norm, not the exception.
Furthermore, personal stake in an
issue is very important for the culti-
vation of social movements - people
tend to get involved in such move-
ments when the issue at hand affects
them in a clear and non-abstract
manner.
So where does a, more nuanced
understanding of history getus?,It's
hard to say Going, back to -Green's
piece, I agree with his fundamen-
tal point that our politics would be
more manageable if more people paid
attention, but perhaps for a different
reason. The late 60s was a time peri-
od when many social groups deter-
mined that traditional democratic
means of political participation were

inadequate to make their voices
heard. The only way they could influ-
ence national policy was by insti-
gating disorder. The optimist in me
hopes that by encouraging civic par-
ticipation, we can use the democratic
process to manage national problems
before they escalate toVietnam-level
chaos.
Student apathy
has come up as
cause for concern.
On the other hand, it's important
for community organizers, policy-
makers and op-ed contributors to
take into account that political apa-
thy exists for a reason. When people
choose not to vote, rather than scold-
ing them for giving up their civic
duty, we may be better off asking
ourselves why they felt their votes
didn't matter. If people are choos-
ing the sports page over coverage of
the demonstrations in Egypt, what
accounts for that?
Over the past week, Tea Party sup-
porters and Wisconsin public work-
ers and students have been rallying
for their respective causes regarding
the proposed state budget. Events
like this take place when most of the
people involved have something to
lose if the political process doesn't go
their way. So the incarnation of the
University in the 1960s doesn't serve
as the model of what today's student
body should look like. Maybe some
future event will be so egregious that
80 percent of the national student
body goes on strike, but I don't see
that happening any time soon.

Anti-Semitic label silences
a key voice in Israel debate
TO THE DAILY:
Ben Duchan's letter to the editor (Anti-Mus-
lim Sentiments in Israel is Exaggerated, 2/14/11)
labels University alum Hamdan Azhar (A Pal-
estinian-Israeli approach, 02/03/2011) a "cow-
ard" who refuses to admit his "anti-Semitism."
We openly reject such a label. This isn't a J
Street UMICH issue. This isn't a Jewish issue.
This is an issue of respect and civil discourse.
As an organization that is pro-Israel and pre-
dominantly Jewish, we have the responsibility
to raise our voices when such a charge is lev-
eled without merit. Duchan clearly falls into
the latter category.
This isn't to say that we agree with the
entirety of Azhar's viewpoint. While J Street
UMICH enthusiastically supports the Michi-
gan Student Assembly resolution for a joint
study abroad program in Israel and the West
Bank, we aren't in agreement with Azhar in
his opposition to study abroad programs in
Israel. We believe that providing a variety of
avenues for students to engage with the region

is important and appropriate for campus.
However, the issues raised by Azhar regard-
ing the conditions under which Palestinians
live in occupation and the discrimination they
face in Israel aren't only crucial to address and
recognize, but factually not up for debate.
Duchan dismisses these critical issues by
dismissing the messenger as "anti-Semitic." In
doing so, he and others like him only solidify
the opposing views on either side and make
the work of building a broad coalition for
peace all the more difficult.
Dismissing those who raise such criticisms,
however, doesn't serve Israel or the peace pro-
cess. Moreover, when charges of anti-Semi-
tism are leveled carelessly, the word is drained
of its power and meaning. We must challenge
anti-Semitism when it arises and where it
exists instead of using the accusation as a
tool with which to silence those with whom
we disagree. We must respect those with real
concerns if we're ever going to reach a com-
promise on important and difficult issues.
This letter was written on behalf of J Street
UMICH by LSA junior Dafna Eisbruch. J
Street UMICH is a pro-Israel, pro-Palesti-
nains, pro-Peace organization.

Recognize GSRAs' rights

While many members of the University community
are familiar with the work of graduate student instruc-
tors - who interact with undergraduates while stand-
ing in front of classrooms, holding office hours and
grading assignments - the work of graduate student
research assistants is less known. There are at least
2,000 GSRAs on the University's Ann Arbor campus,
and their work is the engine behind the research pro-
duced in each segment of campus.
Both GSIs and GSRAs do important work for the Uni-
versity, yet they currently have very different rights.
GSIs work under a contract which provides protection
for their positions as workers. GSRAs don't have these
same protections, and many are surprised to learn that
they aren't covered by the Graduate Employees' Orga-
nization contract. With a union, the University has a
legal obligation to negotiate changes in salaries, ben-
efits and other working conditions. Without a union,
benefits could be changed or taken away without notice.
Additionally, GSRAs don't have the right to a contract-
governed internal grievance procedure with a neutral
arbitrator, and they don't have a union to advocate on
behalf of the employee.
GSRAs were included in GEO's bargaining unit
when the union was initially recognized. However, a
legal decision made in 1981, prompted by a challenge by
the University, recognized GSIs and graduate student
staff assistants as employees but not GSRAs. But this
ruling contrasts with employment rules in other states
where research assistants are considered workers. The
University is a premier research institution, research
is an important function of its mission and GSRA
work enables its groundbreaking research. There are
research assistants who clean data sets, edit tables,
evaluate programs and administer experiments that
are ancillary to their own research interests but benefit
both their supervisors and the University. As workers,
GSRAs have the right to determine the conditions of
their employment.
The campaign to achieve bargaining rights for
GSRAs - should they elect to have them - began out
of the concerns of research assistants, and research
assistants are active members in orchestrating it. When
the campaign is identified as a "GEO" campaign, this
doesn't just refer to the graduate instructors and staff
assistants who are covered by GEO's contract. GSRAs
have joined together as associate members of GEO to
ask the University to recognize the right of GSRAs to
collectively bargain and to "accrete" GSRAs into the

GEO bargaining unit if a majority of GSRAs sign mem-
bership cards requesting representation. "Accretion"
means that research assistants will be represented by
GEO, but it does not mean that provisions of the cur-
rent GEO contract will automatically apply to research
assistants. Following a successful certification of the
GSRA membership cards, GEO - with the full input of
GSRAs - would negotiate with the administration over
which provisions of the current contract might apply
to GSRAs and would also negotiate over GSRA-specific
issues not currently addressed in the contract.
Some concerns have been raised about how GEO,
which is affiliated with the American Federation of
Teachers, would be a good fit for research assistants.
GEO already represents one group of non-teaching
employees: graduate student staff assistants. The GEO
contract is clearly laid out to address the needs of GSIs
and GSSAs. Adding GSRAs would require additional
considerations that could be addressed with negotia-
tions between research assistants and the University.
The AFT, which includes chapters in non-teaching pro-
fessions such as nursing and has other bargaining units
including research assistants, supports GEO - but
ultimately it's-GEO members who determine the condi-
tions of their work with the University.
Campaign staff workers and volunteers from GEO
have had hundreds of conversations with GSRAs
across departments. Organizers have been asking that
research assistants sign a representation card only
if they are very supportive of the campaign and feel
informed enough to make a decision. As of now, more
than 70 percent of research assistants who have been
informed about the campaign have chosen to sign cards
indicatingthat they are in favor ofbringingGSRAs into
the GEO bargaining unit. It's clear that there's great
support for this effort.
GEO simply asks that the University recognize that
graduate research assistants are workers. As workers,
they have the right to freely choose whether or not
to have union representation through GEO, without
interference from the administration. As a democratic
and open organization, we urge anyone with questions
about the campaign, union organizing or GSRA repre-
sentation to contact GEO - and, if you support these
rights for GSRAs, ask the University to recognize them.
Alix Gould-Werth is a GSRA. Kathryn Frank is a GS1.
Rob Gillezeau is a GSRA and the president of GEO. Chelsea
Del Rio is a GSI and GEO's interim vice president.

Michigan and you're really not
sure (what you want to do), that
being in LS&A is probably a real-
ly good idea because there's such
a breadth of possibility there that
you can sample almost anything
you can think of," Coleman said.
"A lot of students learn through
their freshman year of things
that they like, as well as things
that they don't like. I've had a
lot of students tell me that they
come thinking they're going to
do one thing, and they actually
end up in a very different arena."
Additionally, Coleman said
students should be patient and
not worry too much about their
future careers.
"It will come to you," Coleman
said. "I think you should feel con-
fident. You all are smart people ...
You'll get this, you'll figure it out.
I don't think you need to worry
about it. Just be self-confident;
you should be very self-confident
because you've shown that you
can achieve, and plus you've
shown that you can survive in

literature review to stress man-
agement. The offices also provide
counseling for students.
"We feel between those two
offices that a student surely gets
* the support that they need to suc-
cessfully graduate," Ray-Johnson
said in an interview after the
meeting.
The offices see about 80 or 90
students in the span of a calendar
year, according to Ray-Johnson.
These students file grievances
about various campus issues,
though less than 10 of these are
typically formal grievances.
Multiple members of RSG said
at the meeting that they were
unaware of the range of services
available to them through the
offices. But Ray-Johnson said she
thinks the lack of centralization
in the Rackham student body
accounts partly for why a rela-

Harper echoed Coleman's
comments, saying each student
will eventually figure out what
passion they want to pursue in
life.
"My own thinking is that at
some point you'll know," Harper
said. "And I know that is a weird
answer ... but there is a sort of
theme and, pattern, coursing
through your life, and I think it's
just sort of hard sometimes to
track the theme, what you natu-
rally gravitate to."
For many students, Harper
said their passions will be some-
thing they love and can lose track
of time doing. But for now, she
told students, "I also think you
have to sort of let yourself be."
As several other students
in the room shared their con-
cerns about the future - like the
amounts of debt they will gradu-
ate with - Coleman shared her
own story about how her career
turned out to be vastly different
than what she expected and how
happy she is with it today.
"When I was in college, and
I was a chemistry major, I knew
I didn't want to practice medi-
cine. That's not what I wanted to
do. I wanted to do research, but
I didn't want to do the clinical

part," Coleman said. "I think you
find these things about yourself
as you're maturing, and recog-
nizing what you don't want to do
is just as important as sort of fig-
uring out, 'Oh boy, I love this."'
Some students also expressed
concern about whether they'll
even be successful in their time
at the University. Coleman and
Harper told students these con-
cerns are normal, especially
at competitive schools like the
University. Coleman added that
she had similar fears during her
undergraduate years.
"I think sometimes stu-
dents who even come to us with
extremely good academic prepa-
ration in high school are sur-
prisedathowharditiswhenthey
get here to Michigan because
everybody is as smart as you
are or smarter," Coleman said.
"And that's kind of a shock when
you've been in a place where
you're the smartest people."
But not everyone at the event
doubted their potential careers
or academic success at the Uni-
versity.
A graduate student in the
Ross School of Business said he
was uncertain of his future, but
he agreed it wasn't necessary to

choose just one path to pursue.
Instead, he said students who
narrow their interests to a few
areas can help to set their initial
career direction, but even that
doesn't need to commit them to
a certain job.
Coleman agreed with the stu-
dent, saying she never imagined
she would end up as the presi-
dent of a major research univer-
sity. She believed she would only
be a scientist.
"I was a scientist, a biochemist
and thought I would be in the lab
for the rest of my life," Coleman
said. "I wasn't - things happen."
Finding a job and paying off
loans are common concerns for
students and the uncertainty
of the future can be daunting -
something the students at yes-
terday's fireside chat know very
well - but with the benefit of
hindsight, Harper offered these
words to worried students.
"It would be a serious decision
to not do what you're passionate
(about) and called to do for sake
of paying off a loan ... Looking
back, I certainly didn't know this
at the time in my life that you are
in yours - but it's a pretty big
decision to say I'm going to do
something I don't love."


MFORWARD
From Page 1A
parties have not yet announced
their presidential and vice presi-
dential candidates.
Watson said primary issues
on. his campaign platform are
to fight student apathy toward
MSA and to use the assembly to
advocate for student interests
as effectively as possible. To do
this, Watson said he plans to
work on increasing collaboration
with the state government.
"We want to just really get stu-
dents engaged in student govern-
ment and to use that engagement
to lobby the state Legislature and
whoever else we need to make
sure we represent all students,"
Watson said.
Watson was elected to the
assembly in November 2009 and
served as the founding chair of
the Diversity Affairs Commis-
sion. This semester, as speaker
of the assembly, Watson has been
involved with drafting MSA's
new constitution.
Watson said if elected presi-
dent, he wants to be personally
accessible to students. He said he
doesn't feel the current assembly
made it a priority as much as it
should have to consider the stu-
dent perspective.
"One of the things that I want
to do differently as president is
to make myself more available,"
Watson said. "I think going into
the community and talking to
students will increase transpar-
ency. I don't think MSA has done
enough to advocate for students
this term."
Though Campbell has had no
official affiliation with student
government at the University, he
has worked with MSA leaders on
a variety of issues like the Open
Housing Initiative.
Campbell said Watson's expe-
rience working within the assem-
bly and his own lobbying and
advocacy work with the College
Democrats will make them effec-
tive student leaders.
"There's no one who knows
more about how MSA works and
has been a more effective advo-
cate for MSA (than Watson),"
Campbell said. "I'm someone
who doesn't know as much about
how MSA works, but has a differ-
ent.perspective, and is hopefully
able to bring some outside knowl-
edge of how other things work."
Many students and even some
MSA representatives have, in the
past, underestimated the lever-
age MSA has with the Univer-

sity administration, Campbell
said. He said he hopes to use the
assembly as a catalyst to deal
with major University issues.
"One ,of the things I've really
seen working with MSA over the
past couple of years is the access
it has (and) the influence that
MSA can have," Campbell said.
"I think that a lot of members of
MSA don't necessarily under-
stand how powerful MSA can
be."
Watson and Campbell said
they want to work specifically
on making the University more
accessible for current and poten-
tial minority students. Watson
said he hopes to work with a vari-
ety of communities on campus to
ensure students from a multitude
of backgrounds are receiving the
help they need to be accepted to
the University and succeed once
they arrive on campus.
"If MSA, as the central gov-
ernment, can gather all those stu-
dent organizations together and
create a unified campus commit-
ment to increase that diversity,
that's something amazing," Wat-
son said.
To make the University a more
welcoming and diverse place,
Watson said he will continue
fighting hate crimes on campus.
Additionally, he said, if elected,
he plans to encourage dialogue
with student groups and indi-
viduals about what can be done
to help the transition from high
school to college.
The candidates also want to
make MSA more useful to stu-
dent organizations by creating a
process in which campus groups
can directly propose MSA reso-
lutions without the sponsorship
of an assembly representative.
Campbell said he would like MSA
to distribute funds to student
organizations on a rolling basis,
so that the groups can make
programming decisions without
waiting for the assembly's next
funding cycle and won't have to
float money MSA might not reim-
burse.
If elected, Watson and Camp-
bell said they also have ideas
for improving MSA's efficiency
and transparency like posting
the MSA budget with line-item
breakdowns online.
"Students should know exactly
'wherethe money is goingand
how it's being spent," Watson
said. "If students don't like how
their money is being spent it will
be a motivation to come to stu-
dent government and talk about
some things, maybe discuss some
changes."

finds dispensaries to be unnec-
essary and detrimental to the
reputation of the medical mari-
juana industry. He said he would
like the city to clearly define the
terms because citizens - espe-
cially those in the medical mari-
juana business - have the right
to know how the city defines dif-
ferent establishments.
He also said he would like
to have clear regulations, like
guidelines on how to license the
medical marijuana companies,
set before the City Council votes
on the ordinance.
"The definition makes all the
difference in the law," he said.
The city has had a moratorium
on new medical marijuana busi-
nesses since August. Once the
moratorium is lifted, officials
speculate only a few new busi-

nesses will become licensed.
The city has questioned whether
Keene's business existed before
the moratorium - he may not be
eligible to receive a license if it
didn't.
However, Keene said since he
is following the Michigan Medi-
cal Marihuana Act - which has
allowed registered patients touse
medical marijuana in the state
since April 2009 - he doesn't
think his business will be at risk
of being shut down by the city.
City Council Member Sabra
Briere (D-Ward 1) said the law-
suit won't affect the legislation
unless a judge orders the changes
since the council is currently in
the process of editing the ordi-
nance and nothing has been
made permanent.
The next step regarding the

ordinance will be a final reading
at a City Council meeting fol-
lowed by a hearing, Briere said.
But at any point in the process
the ordinance can be amended,
she said.
City Attorney Steve Postema
wrote in an e-mail interview
that he thinks it's strange Keene
is challenging the medical mari-
juana ordinance before it has
been finalized and that he doesn't
think the lawsuit will go much
further.
"Such a lawsuit has no legal
merit and will likely be dismissed
by the court," Postema said.
Like Briere, Postema said since
City Council is still considering
various aspects of the ordinance,
he doubts the lawsuit will have
any influence on the proposal and
its language.

tively low number of students use
the services.
"What we're trying to do is to
really do more outreach, to the
students so that they understand
that there are lots of resources
within their program, but there
are also lots within Rackham,"
Ray-Johnson said.
RSG also discussed the poten-
tial creation of a Graduate Stu-
dent Bill of Rights, which will be
discussed more during the next
meeting in March.
RSG President Michael Ben-
son said the process of drafting
the Bill of Rights is moving at an
accelerated pace and will likely
be in place by the end of the term.
The Bill of Rights would
include the "Rights and Respon-
sibilities" for all University
graduate students and would
encompass all facets of their
experience at the University,
Benson said. He added that other
professional schools at the Uni-
versity are interested in "getting

on board" with the Bill of Rights.
RSG ADDRESSES GEO
CONFUSION
The Academic Affairs Com-
mittee ofRSG also held a meeting
following the assembly meeting
to discuss the ongoing efforts of
the Graduate Employees' Organi-
zation to unionize graduate stu-
dent research assistant.
GEO President Rob Gillezeau
was present during the meet-
ing of the RSG Academic Affairs
Committee to discuss the efforts
of the organization to give
GSRAs collective bargaining
rights. He reported that more
than 1,000 graduate students
have signed GEO membership
cards that show their interest in
joining GEO.
Currently, GSRAs aren't
allowed to have collective bar-
gaining rights in GEO as man-
dated by state law.
The Academic Affairs Com-

mittee addressed the confusion
that exists among graduate stu-
dents regarding the unioniza-
tion debate and discussed ways
in which they are working to
educate Rackham students about
the issue, including plans to hold
town hall meetings in the future.
At last night's RSG meeting
Benson said RSG "is currently
remaining neutral in the union-
ization process."
GEO members met on Tues-
day to discuss the situation, with
some GSRAs voicing apprehen-
sion about joining due to union
costs.
Jeff Frumkin, the University's
associate vice provost and senior
director of the Department of
Academic Human Resources,
said Friday that GSRAs joining
the union "is not really a good
idea."
"The University is not inter-
ested in voluntarily recognizing
GSRAs as having the ability to
organize," Frumkin said.

Gas drillers make waves with NFL tickets

Gas industry pours
political campaign
contributions into
Pennsylvania
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -
When John Hanger, then the
state's top environmental regula-
tor, was offered a coveted trip to
the Super Bowl to see the Pitts-
burgh Steelers in 2009, he turned
it down.
The offer came from Consol
Energy, one of the energy compa-
nies thirsting after the riches of
the nation's largest-known natu-
ral gas reservoir, the Marcellus
Shale.
"I didn't regularly get invita-
tions like that," said Hanger, who
at the time was working to tough-
en regulations on drillers swarm-
ing into Pennsylvania.
The industry, which is pour-
ing billions of dollars into drill-
ing across Pennsylvania, also is
spending millions more in lobby-
ing and political campaign con-
tributions. Unlike most states,
Pennsylvania has no limits on
individual campaign contribu-
tions or gifts to public officials.
Consol, traditionally a coal
company based in Canonsburg,
found at least two takers for the

Steelers' appearance earlier this
month in the Super Bowl: two
state senators, including their
chamber's highest-ranking mem-
ber, who flew at Consol's expense
to Dallas.
Republican Senate President
Pro Tem Joe Scarnati and Demo-
crat Tim Solobay, whose districts
are home to brisk drilling activity,
say they will reimburse Consol for
some or all of the cost.
Republican Gov. Tom Cor-
bett, who took office less than six
weeks ago, received nearly $1 mil-
lion in campaign contributions
from the gas industry. Insisting
that that will not influence policy
decisions, Corbett pledged dur-
ing his campaign to oppose any
tax on Marcellus Shale produc-
tion and has said he supports the
expansion of drilling on state for-
est lands.
Barry Kauffman, the execu-
tive director of the government
watchdog and advocacy group
Common Cause Pennsylvania,
said campaign contributions
and gifts typically get the givers
access to public officials.
"Corbett had already said he
would be a gas industry ally,"
Kauffman said. "One of the key
roles that money played is ensur-
ing that the gas industry's guy
won."
In recent days, Corbett's

administration moved to reverse
a 4-month-old policy viewed by
environmental advocates as an
extra layer of protection against
drilling damage in state parks and
forests where the state doesn't
own the below-ground gas rights.
A critic of the policy, Sen. Mary
Jo White, a Republican, called it
irresponsible and ill-conceived.
Then on Tuesday, a Corbett
spokesman reiterated what the
governor has said, that he intends
to lift a ban on leasing as much
as 1.5 million acres of state forest
land for gas drilling. That ban,
imposed late last year by former
Gov. Ed Rendell, was supported
by TroutUnlimited and the Penn-
sylvania Federation of Sports-
men's Clubs.
"He's looking at that," said
spokesman Kevin Harley. "That
will probably be coming in the
future."
Like Corbett, Scarnati and
Solobay have maintained they
would not be influenced by cam-
paign contributions or gifts.
"Whether you get a hot dog at
the cafeteria or you're having a
state dinner at the Tavern, people
need to give us more credit than
what they do sometimes," said
Solobay, referring to a pricey res-
taurant near Harrisburg.
Kauffman said it is only human
nature to be influenced.

"I know people who treat me
well, and I tend to treat them bet-
ter," he said. "Access to lawmak-
ers is sort of the currency of the
realm, and certainly what cam-
paign contributions and gifts and
hospitality getyou, at a minimum,
is preferential access. And if you
get in to make your case, that's
often all you need. People who
give you campaign contributions
or a trip to the Super Bowl,ithey're
going to get in to see you."
The Marcellus Shale formation
lies primarily beneath Pennsyl-
vania, New York, West Virginia
and Ohio. But Pennsylvania is the
center of activity, with more than
2,000 wells drilled in the past
three years and many thousands
more planned. Meanwhile, pro-
duction from the shale, still in its
early stages, is already as brisk as
production from the tens of thou-
sands of wells in Pennsylvania's
longstanding shallow gas indus-
try.
State forest leases under Ren-
dell resulted in more than 25
wells, with many more possible.
For two years, Rendell, a Demo-
crat, pressed for a gas extraction
tax and for much of it, the Repub-
lican-controlled Senate, with
Scarnati in charge, turned away
his proposals before countering
with a proposed tax that Rendell
viewed as far too low.

ASB

their participants out and is
in the process of relocating all
groups who were scheduled to
volunteer there," Johnson wrote
in a Jan. 26 e-mail informing the
participants of the cancellation.
Samantha Wolthuis, director
of service at AJWS, said though
the organization called off the
ASB trip for the University stu-
dents, it also provided alterna-
tive options.
"We cancelled the Guatemala
portion and offered for the group
to go to Nicaragua or Mexico,
but because of logistical rea-
sons, Hillel opted not to take that
offer," Wolthuis said. "So we ini-
tially transferred the group from
Guatemala to other countries
because of the safety and secu-
rity issues in Guatemala."

In addition to security con-
cerns, Wolthuis said that there
were "multiple reasons" why
they removed the trip in Guate-
mala, and the final decision was
made between AJWS and pro-
gram officers in Guatemala. She
said groups at other universities
that were also supposed to go
to Guatemala were cancelled as
well..
Johnson wrote in the e-mail
to the students that a majority of
the group's members had timing
conflicts with rescheduling the
trip to Nicaragua, and the trip to
Mexico would cost about $300
more for each student. The other
option was to move the Guate-
mala trip to May, but that option
conflicted with the students'
schedules.
Johnson said in an interview
though she knew security was
an issue, she is not entirely sure
why AJWS cancelled the trip to

Guatemala.
She saidthough AJWS told her
"the government was oppressing
(the) community in Guatemala,"
the organization didn't clarify
what community was being sup-
pressed or what this precisely
meant.
Johnsonwrote inhere-mail to
the students that she understood
the frustrations cancelling the
trip might cause.
"I share your sentiments
about making alternate spring
break plans this late," Johnson
wrote to the students. "However,
I urge you to keep in mind that
these complications primarily
came about due to the concern
for the safety of the students, not
by any carelessness or oversight
of those working to create this
trip for you."
While students were told
travel insurance wouldn't cover
the cost that incurred for cancel-

ling the flight, Hillel Executive
Director Michael Brooks wrote
in an e-mail to the students
that Hillel would cover the $150
refund fee for students if neces-
sary.
Students planning to attend-
the trip said they were disheart-
ened but understanding when
they heard the trip was can-
celled.
Kinesiology senior Ali Spies-
man said her "biggest reaction
was just disappointment" and
that she was looking forward to
the trip after previously trav-
eling to El Salvador through
AJWS.
"I really wanted another
opportunity to go on another
service mission, and I figured
what better chance than through
the school?" she said. "(ASB) is
something so different, some-
thing that most students don't
get to do on spring break and

then you just get that taken away
from you."
LSA freshman Michelle Rubin
said she was excited to go on the
trip and form new friendships.
"I've heard a lot of positive
feedback from people who went
in the past, particularly through
Hillel," Rubin said. "I thought
it would be a good way to get
involved with Hillel and meet
people."
LSA freshman Kevin Wender
said though he still feels let
down the trip was cancelled, he
respects the decision.
."I wouldn't want to put my
well-being at risk," he said.
Wender said he wasn't sure
what the group was going to do
in Guatemala, but they were sup-
posed to find out the details at an
orientation, which was sched-
uled for Feb. 7.
Johnson said the mission was
going to help build a center for

classes and various programs for
indigenous communities facing
oppression.
LSA freshman Brenna Hoff-
man said she chose Hillel's ASB
over other choices at the Univer-
sity because she liked the loca-
tion options better.
At a University Board of
Regents meeting last week,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman praised the number of
University students traveling on
ASB trips at 35 different loca-
tions next week.
"I'm pleased to tell you that
we have some 450 students who
are participating in Alternative
Spring Break and fanning out
across the country to perform
community service," Coleman
said. "Public service is a proud
campus tradition and I want to
commend our students for giv-
ing their vacation time to help
others."

Michigan to honor lone senior
Hicks against Golden Gophers

Sophomore winger Chris Brown has improved his level of play since he joined
seniors Louie Caporusso and Carl Hagelin on a line.

For the Michigan women's
basketball team, game days at

ing the fan who

Adidas basket-

contest - will be on just one
individual: senior guard Veroni-
ca Hicks.
As the Wolverines' lone senior,
Hicks will be honored during
Michigan's last home game of
the season against Minnesota
(3-11 Big Ten, 11-16 overall).
Hicks has made a name for
herself this season, leading the
Wolverines in scoring - with
just under 12 points per game -
and rebounds, with 5.5.
"It goes without saying that
when you're around for a period
of time, you know all the short-
cuts," Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth said after practice on
Tuesday. "You know all the loop-
holes, you know what's expected
of you and you understand the
competition level and intensity.
(Hicks) has been through all that
and she understands."
But what Hicks also under-
stands is that Thursday's game is
about more than herself.
"The win is really just impor-
tant even beyond being my last
game at Crisler," Hicks said

Senior guard Veronica Hicks is averaging 11.6 points per game this season for the Wolverines.

By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
After missing about three
weeks to represent the US
National Junior team in the
World Junior Championships
this winter,
sophomore NOTEBOOK
forward Chris
Brown has finally gotten back
into a rhythm as a Wolverine.
Brown netted two goals and
an assist during his stint with
the junior team, and even though
he has been back with Michigan
since early January, he is just
now hitting his stride.
"I think he's on the verge of
(playing his best hockey)," Mich-
igan coach Red Berenson said.
"I'm seeing glimpses of it. He's
getting some confidence, and
not just the scoring part. But the
puck touches, playing with his
linemates, getting the puck out
of our zone; that defensive zone
awareness - all these are part of
your confidence in a player."
And the Texan's confidence is
high. Brown scored back-to-back
game-winning goals against
Ohio State and Western Michi-
gan and is currently on a four-
game point streak - a career
best - and has three goals and
an assist during that time.
Brown was moved to a line
with senior forwards Louie
Caporusso and Carl Hagelin
four games ago, and the line has
exploded offensively since that
change. The trio has scored six
goals and tallied seven assists
during its four games together,
with Hagelin also boasting a
four-game point streak since the
move.
"I had a good World Juniors
points-wise, but playing with
Louie and Carl, it's a lot easier
to get points," Brown said. "You
just get the puck to those two,
you try to get open."
Added Berenson: "When you
play with (Louie and Carl), you
better play well. You better lis-
ten, you better pay attention and
you better do the right thing.
V That's part of the leadership fac-
tor."
WOHLBERG WANTS MORE
For junior forward David Wohl-
berg, scoring goals is all about
going back in time.
"I think it's mindset,"Wohl-
* berg said. "I (am) trying to get
back to where I was freshman
year. Last year, mindset-wise,
I thought Ihad to get more and
more points, but this year it's
more of a team thing. There's

not a lot of guys besides Carl
with a ton of points, so it's not
like you're playing for that. You
want the team to win. If you get
points, you get points."
After jumping out to a hot
start this season - he scored six
goals in the first seven games -
Wohlberg has kept his head on
straight during this campaign
and continues to find success
with his team-first focus.
With 12 goals this season,
Wohlberg is second on the team
in lamplighters - just three
goals behind the team-leading
Hagelin.
"It is (encouraging) for alot of
reasons," Berenson said. "Look-
ing at Wally, coming off of last
year where he struggled off and
on, he still picked up some goals
but he wasn't playing the hockey
that he's playing now. Going into
his senior year, you want him to
be a dominant player next year.
I think he's going in the right
direction.".
The junior was the one to step
up and help get the Michigan
power play on track on Satur-
day, as his goal halfway through
the second period in the series
finale against Western Michi-
gan ended an 0-for-22 scoreless
streak on the man-advantage for
the Wolverines (18-7-1-0 CCHA,
21-9-4 overall).
WINNING EXPECTATIONS:
The Wolverines' two wins
against Western Michigan this
past weekend were their 20th
and 21st victories of the season,
making this campaign the 24th
consecutive season Michigan
has notched 20 or more wins.
"I think we're expected to
do that when we come into
each season," Brown said. "It's
an expectation of our own. We
know that we need to get those
wins, we need to get as many
wins as we can because we know
that this league comes down to
the last few games.
"It's a grind every night."
The next-best active streak
in Division I is held by Denver,
which has reached the 20-plus
win mark in nine consecutive
seasons.

Lynch on MichiganDaily.com

Tuesday. "It would put us in a
great position for the season."
The Wolverines (9-5, 16-10)
are at a pivotal moment in their
season with just two games
remaining in regular conference
play. Michigan's 16-10 record
has the Wolverines on the cusp
of a potential at-large bid for the
NCAA Tournament. And Michi-
gan could use some extra cush-
ion in the win column.
"We need to get into the big
tournament," Borseth said. "This
whole thing is about getting into
the NCAA Tournament at this
point right now, and in order to
do that, the tournament commit-
tee wants to see wins. With that
being said, one at a time, every
game right now is extremely
important."
But the Golden Gophers
proved early on this season -
with a 60-50 home-court win
over Michigan - that they are
not a team to underestimate.
Though Minnesota has only

three conference wins on record,
the Golden Gophers have lost six
of their Big Ten games by two
possessions or less, including a
two-point loss to Iowa on a con-
tested layup at the buzzer and a
one-point overtime loss to Indi-
ana.
"Minnesota is tough. They're
physical and they play aggres-
sive," Borseth said. "They're
kind of in your face - they get
into your space, they really press
the envelope with everything
that you do. Last time we played
against them, I don't know if we
were ready for that, or if they
were that much better than we
were.
"I don't know that answer, but
I guess we will find that out on
Thursday."
And come Thursday, the Wol-
verines are emphasizing tough-
ness on the interior and making
shots down the stretch.Over the
past few games, Michigan has
shown an improvement in post

play, specifically by sophomore
forward Rachel Sheffer - she
has averaged 18.5 points and 5.5
rebounds in the last two games,
both wins.
"When you get the ball down
(into the post), you've got to be
able to do something," Borseth
said. "But Minnesota's pretty
tough; they don't give up a lot
inside that lane. They rally really
well when the ball gets around
that basket. It's going to be a
challenge for us."
The Wolverines have several
areas of focus for Thursday's
game, but in the end it all comes
down to securing the last home-
court win of the season. And
though Hicks understands that
this Senior Night won't just be
about her, she wouldn't mind if
the ball bounced her way.
"You want to go out that way,"
Hicks said. "I would like every
shot to go in on that day too,
because it's like, 'This is the last
shot at Crisler, make itgo in."'

Shaw closes in on program home run record

Senior first baseman
10 home runs away
from reaching all-
time mark
By MATT RUDNITSKY
Daily Sports Writer
The throne is in Dorian
Shaw's sight.
After smackingsix home runs
in the No. 11 Michigan softball
team's first 10 games, the senior
first baseman is closing in on
the Wolverines' all-time record.
If she keeps pace, Michigan may
have a new home-run queen
soon.
The record is currently held
by former All-American first
baseman Samantha Findlay,
who has 62 to her name. But
Shaw's outburst lifted her total
to 52, meaning she needs just
10 dingers in the Wolverines'
45 remaining regular season
games to seize the crown.
"It would mean a lot to me,"
Shaw said of breaking the
record. "Playing for a program

that has the history and great
players that Michigan has had,
to be able to leave my mark in
the record books would be a
tremendous accomplishment.
Knowing that I led a category
that Samantha Findlay leads,
and all of the other great hitters
who came before, would be a
great honor."
For a slugger who knocked 21
balls out of the park last year -
tying the team's single-season
record - hitting 10 more home
runs this year seems likely.
Not to mention she is 46
walks and .26 slugging percent-
age points away from Michigan
records - both held by Findlay.
She's also up for the 2011 Lowe's
Senior CLASS award, given to
the most outstanding senior
in Division I softball for excel-
lence in four areas: classroom,
character, community and com-
petition.
But Shaw knows she can't do
any of it without the help of her
teammates, who have played
incredibly well to lead the Wol-
verines to a 10-0 record - one of
the team's best starts ever.
"I haven't been getting

walked often," Shaw said. "I
think it really helps to have
(junior Amanda Chidester)
and (sophomore) Ashley Lane
behind me in the lineup because
pitchers have to make that dif-
ficult decision as to whether
they're going to let me hit or let
them hit, because they're play-
ing so well.
"It's more likely they're going
to pitch to me because I have
that protection behind me. If
they can keep this up, I won't
have to worry about people try-
ing to pitch around me and I'll
just be able to focus on hitting."
If she does indeed reach the
oh-so-magical number of 62
(Mark McGwire, anyone?), it
will put her in 17th-place in
the NCAA record books, with a
chance to rise even higher. The
all-time NCAA record is 90.
Shaw was also named to the
ESPN.com Preseason All-Amer-
ica first-team - along with
senior hurler Jordan Taylor
- and stands a good chance of
becoming just the 12th Wolver-
ine to earn first-team All-Amer-
ica honors.
Still, she isn't letting the

attention mess with her head.
"Honestly, (being named a
preseason All-American) really
doesn't mean anything," Shaw
said. "It doesn't mean that I'm
going to play well or that I'm
better than anyone else. If I play
well, the accolades are going to
come. So I try not to focus on
things like that.
"I mean, it's nice to be rec-
ognized, but at the same time, I
don't want to get wrapped up in
what other people expect me to
do versus what I feel I'm capa-
ble of doing."
And as much as Shaw may
accomplish individually this
year, she says it would just be
the "cherry on top" of the team
playing to its full potential.
"Our expectations don't
change based on what year it
is," Shaw said. We always want
to win the Big Ten Champion-
ship and go to the World Series
and this year is no different.
We want to play in the National
Championship game.
"And while it will obviously
take a little bit of luck here and
there, we have the talent to get
there."

RUNNING OUT OF TIME

Badgers bank three at buzzer to thwart
upset bid, put 'M' tourney hopes in doubt

By ZAK PYZIK
Daily Sports Editor
For 39 minutes and 54 sec-
onds, the Wolverines beat No. 12
Wisconsin last night.
In the other six seconds, the
Badgers hit a buzzer beater to
beat the WISCONSIN 53
Michigan MICHIGAN 52
men's bas-
ketball team, 53-52, at Crisler
Arena.
Wisconsin guard Jordan Tay-
lor received the inbound, but
after being double teamed, he
passed it to teammate and fresh-
man Josh Gasser. He banked in a
3-pointer with Michigan guard
Stu Douglass's hand in his face to
spoil Michigan's upset bid.
"We had them," sophomore
guard Matt Vogrich said. "We
had them for so long. We had
momentum. But then something
like that happens. It's just not a
good feeling, especially when
you're that close. It was like
what, five seconds?"
An upset against Wisconsin
was exactly what the Wolverines
needed to get onthe bubble of the
NCAA Tournament. And with
less than a minute remaining,
sophomore guard Darius Mor-
ris went to the free-throw line
with the chance to seal the deal
by netting two foul shots on his
one-and-one opportunity.
But Morris missed his first
shot from the charity stripe and
the Badgers had possession with
about 20 seconds left. With three
fouls to give, the Wolverines
fouled Taylor on three-straight
inbound plays to leave Wiscon-

sin with just 6.9 seconds left -
enough time to make one last
shot.
"The game was coming down
to these last few possessions,"
sophomore guard Eso Akunne
said. "Wisconsin's known for
shooting solid. We just didn't
want to give them (an opportu-
nity) to get an uncontested shot."
"Gasser took it out, (freshman
guard Tim Hardaway Jr.) was

guarding Gasser and I switched
with Tim," Douglass said. "Tay-
lor was going to go back to his
right hand - that's what he likes.
He did, I touched the ball, and he
just ripped it out and found Gas-
ser spaced while I was trying to
reach in."
After maintaining a comfort-
able lead for most of the first half,
Michigan went into the locker
room at halftime with a 31-30

advantage. Two dunks from red-
shirt freshman Jordan Morgan,
one from Hardaway Jr. and two
3-pointers from Hardaway Jr.
gave Michigan all the momen-
tum it needed in the first stanza.
But halftime doomed the Wol-
verines. Though they started
with a 3-pointer from Douglass,
Wisconsin slowed down the
game and exchanged leads with
Michigan.
The Wolverines shot 35 per-
cent from the field in the sec-
ond half, which allowed the
Badgers to dictate the games
tempo and use coach Bo Ryan's
offense to its full potential -
suck the shot clock dry, score
at the buzzer and get offensive
rebounds on any misses to kill
its opposing team's momentum.
Wisconsin shot just 32 per-
cent in the second half but
outrebounded the Wolverines,
32-30 - the Badgers collected
nine offensive boards to Michi-
gan's two.
"A lot of balls fell in their
hands," Vogrich said. "They
rebounded, it kind of kills you.
They miss a shot and then they
rebound and make the next
one. We just have to keep our
heads up."
Using the home crowd to its
advantage, Michigan swapped
leads with Wisconsin 10 times.
The Wolverines stayed in the
game until the final minutes
but the Badgers found a way to
win.
Taylor provided the most
problems for the Wolverines,
recording the game-winning
assist and scoring a game-high
20 points.
The Wolverines would have
taken fourth place with a vic-
tory against the Badgers which
would theoretically put them
on the bubble of an NCAA
Tournament postseason. But
instead, they fell to seventh
place in the conference stand-
ings.
Michigan takes on Min-
nesota on Saturday, hoping to
regroup from a devastating loss
at the buzzer.
"Each time you lose that
opportunity (to get into the
NCAA Tournament) you've got
to beat somebody else to make
up for it," Michigan coach John
Beilein said. "It comes down to
a numbers game a little bit ...
close doesn't count."

ORIGINAL SCORE
Keeping score with the music awards

The history behind
what makes a Best
Original Score
By JOE CADAGIN
Daily FineArtsEditor
Imagine watching the open-
ing scene of Stanley Kubrick's
"2001: A Space Odyssey" without
its iconic musical score. Instead
of the rumbling opening C major
chord of Richard Strauss's "Also
Sprach Zarathustra," the film
would begin with an uncomfort-
able silence as deep as the uni-
verse it depicts.
Scores provide a level of
meaning in a film beyond the
events that occur onscreen. The
added sense of aural dramahelps
capture the viewer's imagination
and pull him or her into the film.
"2001" would become a mind-
numbing series of long, boring
shots of outer space were it not
for the captivating score.
Since 1934, the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sci-
ences has annually voted to
select film scores that best serve
as dramatic vehicles for their
respective films. According to
the Academy's official rules, a
film's music is judged on its own

quality as well as its contribution
to the film.
What seems like a simple task
of choosing the best score, how-
ever, has been complicated with
the introduction of an impor-
tant criterion: originality. Dur-
ing the 77 years that awards for
best score have existed, there
has always been at least one cat-
egory requiring that the scores
nominated are unique and origi-
nal pieces of music by a single
composer. Since the '30s, this
category has undergone several
erratic modifications, evolutions,
divisions and redefinitions.
Nathan Platte, a lecturer in
the School of Music, Theatre &
Dance who studied studio-era
film music as a doctoral student
at the University, explained
that the emphasis on original-
ity can be traced to the days of
silent film. When a new film was
shown, an organist or orches-
tra would perform excerpts of
pre-existing classical music as
accompaniment. Yet the fact
that these pieces were poorly
arranged instrumentally and
incomplete compositionally
angered music lovers.
"So (composers) started com-
posing, sometimes for special
films, an 'original score,' " Platte
said. "Sometimes it would be

times a film was placed in both,
and sometimes a film that should
have been in one was placed in
the other and vice versa. It's
always been messy."
"I think it's an interesting
problem to have, though," he
added. "It reflects on the ideas
of what is original and why we
prize it over something that is
'less original.'"
Among the various music cat-
egories, the award for Best Orig-
inal Score has reigned supreme
since the mid '80s, resulting in
a trail of neglected "unoriginal"
scores that were ineligible for
nomination.
This year, it's easy to see the
controversial effects of this lim-
iting single category and the
debates that erupt as a result
of the originality requirement.
Composer Carter Burwell's score
for "True Grit" was ousted from
a Best Original Score nomination
since it contained arrangements
of American hymns and folk
songs. Likewise, Clint Mansell's
score for "Black Swan" was ineli-
gible because much of the mate-
rial Mansell used came from
Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake,"
albeit with substantial rear-
rangements.
While it is true that Mansell's
and Burwell's scores rely heav-

ily on pre-existing music, they
are by no means the only films
made during 2010 that make
use of outside material. In fact,
every one of this year's nominees
for Best Original Score includes
some sort ofborrowed music. For
example, "The King's Speech"
includes substantial portions
of Beethoven's symphonies
and concertos, and Hans Zim-
mer, in his score to "Inception,"
reworked the introduction of
Edith Piaf's hit song "Non, je ne
regrette rien."
The moment a pre-existing
musical source is incorporated, a
score becomes less than 100-per-
cent original. To get around this,
the Academy added a definition
of an original score as one that
is "diluted by the use of tracked
themes or other pre-existing
music." Yet who's to say what
constitutes that a film is "dilut-
ed" by outside material?
In the end, the decision is a
subjective one that lies in the
hands of the few Academy mem-
bers who select the nominees.Yet
as long as the originality criterion
continues to determine the Best
Original Score, the Academy will
exclude composers who may not
be original in their source mate-
rial, but who treat pre-existing
music in a new way.

TECHNICAL CATEGORIES
Zooming in on the Academy's tech categories

By MACKENZIE METER
DailyArts Writer
Sometimes the Academy
Awards are boring. From Makeup
to Art Direction to the inevitable
awkward segues to the previously
filmed sci-tech awards, the cere-
mony can seem tedious. Nonethe-
less, amid the stifled yawns and
quick trips to restock on snacks,
some very significant honors are
granted to the thousands of art-
ists who work behind the scenes,
quietly making sure we never
notice they were there.
These award categories
include Cinematography, Film
Editing, Visual Effects, Sound
Editing and Sound Mixing. While
the techies rejoice, most viewers
are left scratching their heads,
not understanding why such a
distinction needs to be awarded
for something that goes unno-
ticed - purposely - by audiences
across the nation and the world.
Let's take this one step at a time
and start with the visual catego-
ries. According to Dan Herbert,
an assistant professor of screen
arts and cultures, cinematogra-
phy is a paramount aspect for the
success of a film and requires the
efforts of many.
"Cinematography is generally
all of the preparation and techni-
cal work to get an image on cel-

luloid," he said. "So, working with might not be as successful as it is.

effects artists may win awards for
the larger-than-life images they
create, the editors are the true
masters of putting it all together
- quietly cutting and pasting
films into logical sequences and
making sure there's an under-
lying coherence to the film as a
whole.
"Hollywood films usually
try to have what's called 'invis-
ible editing,' " Herbert said. "You
actually don't see it happening,
which is tricky - because ifyou
want to get an award for it, you
also want to call attention to
lt."
Editors are ultimately
responsible, with the
director's approval,
for much of the final
product.
"(Editors) pick
up the themes
and kind of make
them happen,"
Herbert said.
"It's actually
the editor who
chooses the
angles that
actually end
up in the
final film, and
so in some ways
they can tell the story."
But what about the
way a movie sounds?
The way "The Hurt
Locker" - last year's
winner for Sound Edit-
ing and Sound Mix-
ing - leaves audiences
captivated by sounds of
explosions amid a stark
desert landscape? Though

seem mystifying, accord-

Department, the differenc-

es are simple.
"Sound editing is when you're
basically cutting between dif-
ferent takes," Corey explained.
"Sound mixing is more adjust-
ing the volume basically of sound
effects and dialogue and music."
Say there are three takes of the
same scene. A sound editor would
find the best sound in a scene and
put it together with the best-look-
ing scene to achieve the best shot.
Sound editing also includes noises
like slamming doors and crunch-
ing gravel - effects created in a
studio and then recorded using
special equipment. Sometimes,
even the voices of the actors are
recorded in a studio and then
spliced into the scenes.
Certain editors, called Foley
artists, record sounds using
everyday things, such as rusty
chairs for squeaking, and are
responsible for inserting these
sounds at specific times during
the film. These sounds can then
be layered to create a more exag-
gerated effect.
Though equally important,

sound mixing is often the last
thing to happen before a film is
considered complete.
"Sound mixing is just always
making sure that we can hear the
dialogue and always hear what's
being said," Corey said.
Without a sound mixer with
a strong grasp of the craft, many
of the noises in films would be
completely drowned out. It's the
sound mixers who will raise the
volume of actors' voices and make
sure there is a balance with the
background noise. Oftentimes
though, sound mixers and edi-
tors never get any praise for their
work.
"If it's done really well, people
don't notice it, but it really adds
a lot of impact to a film," Corey
said. "And when it's not done
well, people notice it. To be really
good, it has to be transparent."
Though both the audio and
visual technical categories are
known for being unnoticeable,
it takes a noticeable artist and
countless hours of work to create
films that the masses enjoy.

English dialogue.
Since the Academy
permits only one film
from each country to be
submitted, the nomina-
tions tend to be heavily asso-
ciated with their countries of
origin.
Often, these small tastes of
international creativity are
taken for granted by American
audiences,who are unfamiliar
with the foreign cultures
and languages repre-
sented in the category's
lineup. However, a clos-
er examination of each
culture's public percep-
tion of film reveals a lot
about the unique aspects
of the submissions we
unceremoniously
group together under
the title "foreign lan-
guage."
LSA senior Lanette Garcia, a
first-generation Mexican-Amer-

ican student, said her interest in
Mexico's nomination, "Biutiful,"
stemmed more from an enthu-
siasm for the fame of the mov-
ie's off-screen makers than its
onscreen stars.
"I wasn't as interested in
seeing the plot as I was in the
people making it," she said. "I
know that two of the movie's
producers, including Guillermo
del Toro, have done some really
great work, so I wanted to watch
it more to see the efforts of the
people behind the scenes."
Garcia also said plots like
that of "Biutiful," which present
profound economic and social
issues to their audiences, are not
uncommon in Latin American
cinema.
"Spanish-language movies
usually involve some sort of social
commentary, more so than in the
United States. I know that this
theme does occur sometimes in
American cinema, but itcomes up
more often in Mexican movies."
The focus on harsh and
unsympathetic thematic mate-
rial is not exclusive to Mexican
cinema. Business sophomore
Andrew Simon said that visiting
his family's native Greece made
him aware of the country's ten-
dency to avoid sugarcoating the
subject matter of its films.
"I've noticed that there never
seems to be a happy ending in
Greek movies, and that they tend
to be much more dramatic and
sad," Simon said. "I think that
the subject matter in most Greek
movies would be considered very
intense for American audiences,
even for our comedies; they tend
to be a lot hornier and use much
less sophisticated humor."
This especially holds true
for Greece's nomination, "Dog-
tooth," which tells the horrifying
story of a father who has refused
to allow his children to make

contact with the outside world
since their births.
Though both Garcia and
Simon had seen some of the Best
Picture nominees from the Unit-
ed States, neither had watched
the movies from the coun-
tries whose cinemas they had
described - a concerning trend
regarding the actual popularity
of these films.
Simon thought this tendency
for mainstream American media
to drown out smaller foreign or
independent films in their coun-
tries of origin could possibly
be held at bay if Greece were to
receive recognition in the form
of an Oscar.
"Winning this award would
be very important for Greece
mainly because their most pop-
ular movies and TV shows are
from the United States," he said.
Nowhere is this trend more
apparent than in Canada. For
Music, Theatre & Dance fresh-
man Nicole Gellman, who has
not seen Canada's nomination,
"Incendies," a win would be an
important distinguishing event
for a country whose media has
been completely hijacked by
American television and movies.
"I've lived in Windsor, Ontar-
io, Canada all my life, and I've
grown up with mainstream Hol-
lywood movies," Gellman said.
"Canadian movies and television
shows are few and far between. I
honestly don't think that I could
name a Canadian movie off the
top of my head; I'm certain that
I've seen more foreign films from
France or Spain than I have from
Canada."
For Gellman, Canadian influ-
ences in cinema are limited to
the actors and actresses with
whom Americans are already
familiar.
"I know Canadian actors
well," she said. "We have Jim

Carrey and Kiefer Sutherland
and many other amazing actors,
but I don't differentiate between
Canadian and American films.
I'm sure that it's because our
media has become so American-
ized."
Nominations like "Incendies"
emphasize the obscurity of the
guidelines by which countries
choose their Oscar film nomina-
tions. Though its director and
producers are Canadian, its plot
centers around two Lebanese
siblings returning to the Middle
East in search of the truth about
their mother's role in the Leba-
nese Civil War.
Do countries select the movies
that are most popular, or do they
focus on the ratings they have
received? Should a nomination
be a celebration of the culture
and people of its home coun-
try, or an outstanding presenta-
tion highlighting the skills of its
directors and producers?

With the swelling popularity
of American blockbuster movies
made possible by Hollywood's
extravagant budgets, the dispar-
ity in foreign cinema between
supporters and viewers becomes
starkly apparent. Despite the
fact that foreign producers and
directors , receive strong gen-
eral encouragement for their
efforts to expand the influence of
non-American cinema, the fact
remains that the films they cre-
ate acquire more moral support
than actual audience traffic.
While some hope, exists
that this trend can be reversed
through international exposure
from awards like the Oscars,
moviegoers' actions suggest that
seeing competitive cultural rel-
evance in foreign films requires a
fundamental shift in the public's
perception of modern media -
something thata press boost and
a golden statuette alone can't
provide.

ANIMATION
Coloring in the lines on the animated shorts

By DAVID TAO
Daily Film Editor
* The lights dim as we open on
the face of a cartoon man wear-
ing an eyepatch and a fiendish
grin. As a distorted industrial
soundtrack hums in the back-
ground, he shifts the patch to
cover his good eye, revealing
a jet black orb that suddenly
morphs into an eyeball. Sud-
denly, he begins drooling a lime
green acid - it sinks past the
bottom of the frame only to reap-
pear oozing from the top of the
screen, splashing onto his head
and slowly dissolving him.
The clip's director, Music,
Theatre & Dance senior Sam
Zettell, slouches nonchalantly as
the video ends. The faces in the
audience are tinted with a mix-
ture of incredulity and awe at the
clip's complexity and eccentric-
ity.
Somebody chimes in humor-
ously: "I think you never cease
to be incredibly weird, and I'm
assuming you're going to take
that as a compliment."
Students and
professionals
alike draw their
own reality.
Zettell grins as the class
bursts into laughter.
This is SAC 406: Computer
Animation II, and these students
are presenting their projects in
rotoscoping, one of many anima-
tion techniques they learn over
the course of the semester. It's
a labor-intensive process - one
that involves tracing individual
live-action frames and play-
ing them together to simulate
movement - and is a precursor
to the course's three- to five-
minute final project. Due to the
more time-consuming nature of
animation, the clips are short,
averaging between 15 and 20 sec-
onds, and have low frame rates
that give some of them a choppy,
almost stop-motion feel.
To their professor, Chris

McNamara, these students' proj-
ects exemplify the creative berth
animation gives artists. Though
the source material many stu-
dents chose was similar, varying
approaches lent each project an
unpredictable and unique sense
of personality.
"There's this initial thought:
'Well, it's all going to look the
same,"' McNamara said. "Every-
body - the way they hold their
pen, the way they use their
mouse, the way they approach
what to include and what to
exclude - I think it's where the
personality and the style of the
individual artist come out in
ways that you can't anticipate."
The diversity of the projects
is impressive. In addition to
Zettell's avant-garde experi-
ment, there are tributes to the
Swing Era, featuring roto-
scoped versions of Fred Astaire
and Ginger Rogers dancing to
Sinatra. There's a cartoon mini-
skateboard that flips along the
cereal bowl it's superimposed
against. There's even an ani-
mated version of Tom Goss, the
University researcher often seen
playing harmonica outside Shap-
iro Undergraduate Library.
For students like Zettell, this
is the appeal of animation. This
is a medium that can take fantas-
tical concepts - like the living
playthings of "Toy Story 3" and
the ferocious, cat-like beasts of
"How to Train Your Dragon" -
and bring them to painstaking,
heartwarming life. The ability
to create one's own fantastical
world, free of the logic and pre-
dictability of live action, holds
plenty of allure.
"The possibilities are much
more limitless," Zettell said. "To
make really highly fictionalized
stories in film, you gotta have a
butt-ton of CGI, and it doesn't
always look as good."
Despite its boundless creative
potential, animation is relative-
ly new to the University. It was
first offered in the late '90s as a
night school program that used
primitive technology. Since
then, the program has moved to
a brand-new classroom in North
Quad, designed to balance stu-
dents' access to technology
with professors' constructive
criticism. Desks along the walls

feature rows of state-of-the-art
iMacs, each running the latest
version of cutting-edge soft-
ware like Adobe Photoshop and
Adobe After Effects. Students
split their time between these
platforms and the discussions,
critiques and presentations that
happen around the long wooden
table at the room's center.
"This room was really
designed for a course like
this," McNa-
mara said.
"As much 3
I want my
students to
have access
to the com-
puters, I
want to havea t
lot of face time E
as well."'
This'
principle of
seminar-likek
input allows
McNamara
to vary they
pace of his teach-
ing and give plenty of
valuable feedback. In
SAC 406's advisory ,
prerequisite, SAC 306:
Computer Animation
I, McNamara builds Y
slowly from the ground
up, constructing a solid
technological founda-
tion and allowing stu-
dents from unrelated
majors to get their feet
wet and explore. Zettell,
for example, is not a SAC
major and started ani-
mation knowing almost
nothing.
"I never knew how to
use Photoshop," Zettell
said. "(SAC 306) starts

with bare basics."
A semester-and-a-half later,
Zettell and his peers are their,
own one-person production com-
panies. They create their own
storyboards, score their own
soundtracks, execute their own
images and put the pieces togeth-
er into the unique final products
that flash across the screen. It's
this intense level of cre-
ative control and the
opportunity to make

work. The animated features
vying for Oscar gold this Sunday
are massive collaborative efforts
- "Toy Story 3," for example,
has more than 60 people cred-
ited under the animation depart-
ment. Instead, the course shares
more with the creative process
behind animated shorts. These
projects trade financial resourc-
es for more time and artistic
flexibility and can be just as poi-
gnant and critically acclaimed as
their big-screen counterparts.
A prominent example of this
phenomenon is this year's "Let's
Pollute!" The brainchild of for-
mer Pixar animator Geefwee

Boedoe, the short was directed
and animated almost entirely by
Boedoe himself over more than
three years. It's now nominated
for an Oscar. Another exam-
ple is "Wallace and Gromit," a
stop-motion franchise with its
roots in the short-film format.
Written, directed and animated
almost entirely by Nick Park, the
original short film, "A Grand Day
Out with Wallace and Gromit,"
was also nominated for an Oscar
in 1991 and became a blockbust-
er franchise. For the students
of SAC 406, starting small and
starting alone may be their key
to future success too.

'U'-OSCAR CONNECTIONS
Wolverines walk the red carpet

Former University
students tell their
Oscar stories
By DAVID RIVA
DailyArts Writer

When the 83rd installment
of the Academy Awards airs on
Sunday, viewers will be greet-
ed by some familiar sights - a
scarlet carpet, tough-to-open
envelopes, sappy acceptance
speeches and rude interruption
music - the essential ingredi-
ents for the film industry's night
of top honors. On TV, the ritual-
istic practices of the event seem
to remain static over time, giv-
ing at-home audiences a general
idea of what to expect from year
to year. So it can be easy to for-
get that all the nominees have a
story - a "road to the Oscars," if
you will.
Whether winning their own
award or reporting on the cer-
emony, University alumni John
Nelson and Katie Cwayna and
former University Law School
student Kurt Luedtke sustain
more ofapersonal connectionto
the Academy Awards than most
people. Their experiences pro-
vide a unique look into the lives
of Oscar winners as well as the
behind-the-scenes aspects of an
eventful week in Los Angeles.

N

"As much as it was fun, I was
exhausted and not sleeping and
writing scripts and revising
scripts through all hours of the
night," she said.

"The first eight rows are
where the movie stars are seat-
ed, and that section's lit for tele-
vision," Luedtke wrote. "When
you're accepting, you're looking
down at, and seeing very clearly,
a dozen or 20 of the most recog-
nizable people in the world who
are, for some reason, looking up
at you."
The press room, photogra-
phers and poster signing after
winners are ushered backstage
make for a surreal moment,
accordingto Nelson.
This kind of pressure is
something that he rarely expe-
riences, and he believes the
Academy takes steps to put the
crowd at ease.
"I think once you go through
it, you realize why it is very
important to have someone
funny hosting the event." he
wrote. "The humor relaxes peo-
ple who are really, really ner-
vous."
Once he had the infamous
golden statue in hand, Luedtke
claimed that expressing grati-
tude to a laundry list of people
was harder than it looked.
"Delivering my carefully
rehearsed 'Out of Africa' accep-
tance, I entirely forgot the part
acknowledging the director," he
confessed.
Luedtke later found out that
"Out of Africa" director Sydney
Pollack asked his wife, "You
think Kurt's speech was a little
short?" after this blunder.
Nelson's speech for his "Glad-
iator" win, on the other hand,
would forever be remembered
by the inclusion of a person rath-
er than an exclusion.
His father turned 86 years old
the day he won and was fatally
ill with cancer.
"I ended my allotted 30 sec-
onds with, 'Thanks to my mom
in heaven and my dad and fam-
ily back in Detroit. Happy birth-
day, Dad. I love you,' " he wrote.
"I brought the Oscar home and
showed him it. He thought it
was beautiful, and the next week
he passedeon."
Touching storylines are not
the only aspects of the ceremony
that go unnoticed by the TV-
viewing audience. The Oscars
have some surprises that are
concealed by the network airing
the show.
"What most surprised me was
that plenty of people attend the
Academy Awards who aren't
Academy members," Luedtke
explained. "The advertisers get
free tickets, I was told, and they
wind up in the strangest hands."
One pair of tickets was auc-
tioned off at a fundraiser for
Cranbrook Educational Com-
munity in Bloomfield Hills,
Mich. - Luedtke attended its
affiliated Cranbrook-King-
swood High School. He believes
the tickets arrived there via
General Motors, which runs

Early mornings in L.A. I'd like to thank the Academy

It only seems logical that a
person who could potentially be
in the running for an Academy
Award would vigilantly wait for
nominations to be announced.
But John Nelson, a 1976 Univer-
sity alum, is normally too tired
for anxious anticipation.
"They announce the nomi-
nations at 5:30 a.m. L.A. time
to make the 8:30 a.m. news in
(New York)," Nelson wrote in
an e-mail interview. "If you live
in L.A. and get nominated, the
phone wakes you up with people
saying congrats."
Nelson has been woken up in
this manner on three occasions:
when he received nominations
in the Best Visual Effects cat-
egory for "Gladiator," "I, Robot"
and "Iron Man."
Former "Good Morning
America" segment producer
Katie Cwayna, a 2007 University
alum, was similarly affected by
this time gap between the East
and West Coast. Last year, the
morning show was broadcasted
live in L.A. on the Friday before
and Monday following the Acad-
emy Awards ceremony.
Cwayna - who majored in
Communication Studies while
at the University - noted that,
though many people were excit-
ed to hear she was covering the
event, the experience was gruel-
ing.

COURTESY OF DREAMWORKS
'U' alum John Nelson won a Visual Effects Oscar for his work in "Gladiator."

What happens on TV does not
tell the whole story.
When the sun goes down on
the day of the Oscars, Nelson
said being a nominee becomes
considerably more nerve-wrack-
ing than one might expect.
"You are pretty much scared
shitless until you know if you've
won or not," he explained. "After
that you are either very happy or
a little depressed."
Two-time nominee Kurt
Luedtke felt this tension so
much that he, found it neces-
sary to leave his seat and smoke
a cigarette, almost missing the
presentation of his award.
"According to the program,
the Adapted Screenplay award
was several presentations
away," he wrote in an e-mail
interview. "I went out for a ciga-
rette (and) eventually returned
to an agitated wife who told
me they'd changed the order of
things and Adapted Screenplay
was now."
Luedtke had barely sat down
when he was announced as the
winner of the category for writ-
ing "Out of Africa."
Both Luedtke and Nelson
were shocked by the response
they received immediately after
winning an Academy Award,
claiming the celebrity and press
attention was somewhat over-
whelming.

commercials during the broad-
cast.
Some of the seats are also
filled by hired help.
"What most surprised (my
wife) was that the show hires
high school kids to dress up in
their prom clothes to fill the
seats for the cameras when
ticketholders like me are wan-
dering around elsewhere,"
Luedtke continued.
The weight of the hardware
was also unexpected.
"The Oscars are heavy, heavi-
er than you'd think," he wrote.
"I'm surprised more winners
don't drop them."
Additionally, the nightlife
afterthe ceremony is only briefly
alluded to on TV. In reality, the
party scene is vast and contin-
ues into the wee hours of the
morning. According to Luedtke,
lugging around that heavy gold
statue commands a sizable
amount of respect around town.
"En route to the Academy
Governors Ball, we got caught
in traffic, left our limo, got lost
and wound up outside the rear
entrance of the Beverly Wilshire
ballroom," he explained.
But all Luedtke had to do was
flash the figurine to gain admit-
tance to the festivities.
According to Cwayna, the
ceremony acts as the formal cen-
terpiece for aweek-long celebra-
tion throughout Los Angeles.
The movie capital of the world
is taken over by parties, promo-
tional events and other festivi-
ties that extend the excitement
around the Oscars well beyond
its allotted TV time slot.
Lounges and gifting suites
at the event provide a constant
source of excitement as brands
promote themselves with give-
aways.
"It's more than just, 'Who's
going to win Best Actor?' "
Cwayna said.
Reaching for the gold man
The Oscars might be one
whirlwind of a week, but nomi-
nees don't arrive in L.A. without
first doing some old-fashioned
hard work.
Nelson's road to the Academy

Awards ran straight through
Ann Arbor, as he graduated
from the University with a bach-
elor's degree in General Studies.
"I got a good education
in making films with lim-
ited resources," he explained.
"Teachers like (Screen Arts &
Cultures Prof.) Frank Beaver
taught us how to be inventive
with what we had and encour-
aged us to take chances. We
had less courses in film pro-
duction or scriptwriting than
the programs at USC or NYU,
but we have put many people
in the industry just the same.
We learned how to improvise to
succeed."
At the time, the vast resourc-
es available for students within
the Department of Screen Arts
& Cultures were not available.
In fact, the SAC department
wasn't founded until recently, so
aspiring filmmakers had to look
elsewhere to get an education.
As for the next generation of
moviemakers, Nelson encourag-
es an emphasis on narrative over
technical extravagance, despite
being a visual effects supervisor
himself.
"Learn technique, but know
that the creative part of film-
making that tells the story will
always be more important than
the technical thing that looks
cool or is new," he wrote.
Luedtke expressed a similar
sentiment, but had a more brash
way of saying it.
"Get offyour assand research
your story, its period and set-
ting; and your characters' lives,"
he said.
The Oscars mean something
different to everyone, and
despite its annual appearance
on.TV, the show is always pro-
ducing heart-wrenching and
hilarious stories and unforget-
table moments.
Though he admits winning
the award was a nice piece of
recognition, Luedtke wrote that
"getting the movie made was
the high point."
Nelson, however, can hardly
put into words what the little
gold man means to him: "It
ranks up there with my wedding
day and the birth of my son."

AWARDS
From Page 1B
The Oscars are power. They are
a way for the rich to get richer.
They are prestige. They are what
gives Jack Nicholson the right
to a lifetime of courtside seats at
Lakers' games, and what help him
pay for the $10,000 sunglasses he
wears to them.
But the Oscars are also coun-
terculture. They award directors
and actors whose art defies social
and cultural norms. The Oscars
show us that there are epic tales
to tell in everyday scenarios, and
how insane, conflicted, confused
or controversial characters often
end up being the most meaning-
ful to us. They are the governing
body that awarded and applauded
a much younger Jack Nicholson
for screaming,'spitting and curs-
ing at the powers that be in "One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."
Some call the Oscars fake. A
symbol of our culture's vanity and
shallow "Did-you-see-what-she-
was-wearing?" celebri-worship.
But the Oscars are as real as the
emotion that an earnest Tom
Hanks or an exuberant Cuba Good-
ing Jr. displayed while accepting
their awards for unforgettable per-
formances in "Forrest Gump" and
"Jerry Maguire," respectively.
The Oscars are a formality for
some films - directors and actors
that everyone assumes will win
before their films even finish pro-
duction. They are cherries atop
epic cinematic sensations like
"The Lord of the Rings," "Gladia-
tor" and "Titanic."
But the Oscars also help films
"break even," as Woody Allen
quipped while receiving his
award for a film that actually lost
money (1977's Best Picture winner
"Annie Hall"). The Oscars help
lesser-known directors, writers,
actors, costume designers, edi-
tors, sound mixers, musicians
and production companies finally
gain recognition. Oscar is a jack
of all trades, hobnobbing with
diamond-encrusted legends while
simultaneously lifting struggling
filmmakers out of obscurity. Even
an Oscar nomination boosts an
artist's career, guaranteeing an
increase in his or her status with-
in our cultural canon - or, at least,
in his or her ability to pay the gas
bill.
The Oscars are America. Thus,
they are a paradox - they contra-
dict themselves and contain mul-
titudes. They are modern artistic
decadence. They are tearful;
answered prayers. They are exclu-
sive. They are nationally tele-
vised. They are nods to the past.
They are signs of where the art of
film is headed.
The Oscars are a three-hour
spectacle that gives us something
to argue about between football
and baseball season. They are
timeless, connecting us to previ-
ous generations of film lovers we
never met, and to those we've yet
to birth.
They are the only American
tradition we count on to reinvent
itself. They are scripted. They are
live.
