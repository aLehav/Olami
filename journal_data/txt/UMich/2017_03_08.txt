Acclaimed 
criminal 
justice 

attorney 
Bryan 
Stevenson 

received 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Wallenberg 
Medal 

Tuesday evening at a packed 
Rackham 
Auditorium 
filled 

with more than 1,000 attendees. 
Stevenson, the head of the Equal 
Justice Initiative and author 
of 
best-selling 
memoir 
“Just 

Mercy,” 
delivered 
a 
keynote 

address narrating his experiences 
in criminal justice reform and 
urging attendees to craft hopeful 
narratives.

According to John Godfrey, the 

assistant dean for international 
education 
at 
the 
Rackham 

Graduate School and member of 
the medal selection committee, 
the Wallenberg Medal is an 
annual award given to a person 
who demonstrates a commitment 
to human rights.

“We look for someone who 

has upheld the values of Raoul 
Wallenberg,” 
Godfrey 
said. 

“Someone who is outspoken in the 
defense of human rights, who has 
put himself or herself in the front 
lines for justice protecting those 
who are oppressed and who have 
really sought to make a difference 
in the world.”

Previous 
winners 
of 
the 

Wallenberg 
Medal 
include 

Russian journalist Masha Gessen, 
an outspoken Putin critic; U.S. 
Rep. John Lewis (D–Ga.), a civil 

Lambda 
Chi 
Alpha 

fraternity held a candlelight 
vigil Tuesday night in honor 
of their brother, Peter Hart, 
who took his own life in 
February before Spring Break. 
Hundreds gathered on the 
front lawn of the fraternity to 
share stories and remember 
Hart.

LSA 
sophomore 
Daniel 

Greene, president of Lambda 
Chi Alpha and Hart’s social 
big, 
spoke 
to 
the 
group 

gathered on the front lawn in 
memory of Hart.

“Peter Hart will always 

be loved, will always be 
missed,” Greene said. “But as 
his big, as his president, as 
his friend, most importantly 
as his brother, I ask that 
you continue his legacy in 
challenging yourself to be 
slightly more honest with 
the world; to be slightly more 
open-minded.”

LSA sophomore Michael 

Wysong, a member of the 
Sigma 
Kappa 
fraternity, 

attended the vigil to show 
support for other members of 
Greek life and for his friends 
who knew Hart personally.

“I think it’s affecting us 

really hard since a lot of … 
guys deal with depression, 
so we all just want to let 
everyone know that you can 
always 
talk 
to 
someone,” 

Wysong said. “It’s basically 

a way just for everyone to 
realize that there’s always 
someone next to you.”

LSA freshman Anna Fedder 

met Hart during orientation, 
and said she has been in 
shock since hearing of Hart’s 
passing.

“I saw him … two weeks ago, 

or something like that, just 
walking around, on my way 
back from class,” Fedder said. 

“It’s tough. I wish I had known 
more, I guess … but obviously 
you can’t go back and fix that.”

LSA junior Andrew Sharon, 

a brother at the fraternity, 
said 
since 
Hart’s 
passing, 

members 
of 
the 
Lambda 

Chi Alpha fraternity have 
been trying to process the 
tragedy, 
celebrating 
Hart’s 

membership in the fraternity 
and knowing him.

“Obviously 
everyone 
is 

really upset,” Sharon said. “But 
more importantly, we’re happy 
we had Peter around. He was 
always the most committed. 
I live at the house and he was 
always at the house more than 
I was. He literally just wanted 
to be in everything — he ran 
for positions, he was always at 
every party, every event, every 
brotherhood event.”

“Pa’Delante” is a saying often 

used in Latino communities, in 
English translation it’s commonly 
translated to mean “pick yourself 
up, dust yourself off, and keep 
moving forward.” This type of 
resilience was a prevailing theme 
among speakers at a panel hosted 
Tuesday 
evening 
discussing 

immigration, specifically for the 
Latino community and in relation 
to recent immigration policies set 
by President Donald Trump.

Nearly 50 students, faculty and 

community 
members 
gathered 

to hear from five panelists with 
experiences 
including 
working 

with and assisting immigrants, 
providing 
employment 
with 

seasonal and migrant workers and 
studying healthy equity within 
immigrant communities.

Panelist Rudy Flores, co-chair 

of the Migrant Resource Council 
of Southeast Michigan, explained 
that in the past 48 hours in his town 
of Adrian, there have been three 
different ICE raids. In which raids, 
three people were detained.

“These are situations that we 

anticipated but didn’t expect,”

Cydney 
Gardner-Brown, 
a 

recently accepted applicant to the 
University of Michigan, is having 
difficulty deciding whether she 
wants to be a Wolverine. The 
debate does not center around the 

price of admission or housing, nor 
is she concerned about leaving 
home for the first time. Gardner-
Brown is more concerned about her 
safety as a Black student.

In an op-ed published in the 

RHS Stentor — Renaissance High 
School’s student news publication 
— titled “Should I fear attending 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan?” 

Gardner-Brown investigates the 
emotional cost in adjusting from a 
predominantly Black high school to 
a predominantly white campus — a 
transition she describes as “going 
off to spaces without guarantee of 
our safety.” 

The Stentor is part of Dialogue, 

a 
quarterly 
publication 
that 

incorporates student contributions 

from several Detroit high schools. 
It is jointly supported by Crain 
Communications, a Detroit-based 
publishing conglomerate, and the

A resolution to support an 

academic holiday on Election Day 
for 2020 and all even-numbered 
years after that passed during 
Tuesday night’s Central Student 
Government meeting with 30 
in favor, five opposed and none 
abstaining. 
The 
resolution 

faced 
pushback 
from 
some 

representatives, who said the 
resolution only featured the views 
of students in CSG and wasn’t 
reflective of the student body in 
general.

While 
introducing 
the 

resolution, Engineering freshman 
Mario Galindez, a member of the 
Engineering Student Government, 
talked about how voter turnout 
has historically been much lower 
in student-populated areas as 
compared to more residential, non-
student populations.

He also mentioned how long 

lines, especially in areas like the 
Michigan Union, were caused by 
the lack of student and faculty 
volunteers who could have aided 
the process. These individuals 
could have helped, however, if they 
had the day off.

International Women’s 
Day in Lane Hall

WHAT: Lane Hall will be open 
and available to anyone seeking a 
space for rejuvenation, discussion 
and action in pursuit of gender 
equity and justice.

WHO: Department of Women’s

WHEN: 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

WHERE: Lane Hall

This article is part of an ongoing 

series of articles outlining specific 
initiatives 
of 
Central 
Student 

Government on campus.

Business 
sophomore 
Arathi 

Sabada, 
a 
Central 
Student 

Government representative, has 
been working with Michigan 
Dining and the Dean of Students 
Office to implement an emergency 
meal program that will allow 
students 
living 
off-campus 

worried about food security to 
request six meals during the 
winter 2017 semester.

Food security is a prominent 

issue on college campuses, with 
a study conducted by Hunger 
on Campus finding 43 percent 
of all students with a meal plan 
experience food insecurity, and 
46 percent of these students run 
out of meal points before the end 

of the term. At the Universityof 
Michigan, all dormatory meal 
plans are unlimited, though off 
campus students have to choose 
how many meals to purchase for 
the semester.

Sabada stated any University 

students could benefit from the 
new program, and they could 
either be referred by Counseling 
and Psychological Services or 
University Health Services. They 
could also walk in and talk to 
the dean of students to see if the 
program would work for them.

“Essentially a student can go 

there and for whatever reason they 
might be food insecure, they can 
request six meals from dining.” 
Sabada said. “If they happen to be 
struggling this month, it’s meant 
to tide them over and get them 
through the week, the semester, 
whenever they need it. The dean of 
students will then contact dining 
and add the meals to the student’s 

MCard, so anyone is eligible for the 
program.”

Public Policy junior Joe Shea, 

CSG communications director, 
mentioned the program allowed 
students on campus to have 
access to alternative food sources 
to ensure that their academic 
performance didn’t suffer because 
of a lack of food security.

“The emergency meal program 

was based on this idea that ‘Leaders 
and Best’ is something that we 
often use to describe ourselves as 
students, but in thinking about 
what allows students to be leaders 
at their best — they need to have 
access to nutritious foods for 
every meal of the day.” Shea said. 
“That is the founding belief of the 
emergency meal program.”

Sabada stated though most 

studies suggest food insecurity is 
a large problem on campus, there 
wasn’t sufficient data collected 
specifically from the University. 

She mentioned it was hard to 
find out how and whom to help 
when there weren’t any numbers 
for them to build on.

The idea of the program 

came 
from 
working 
with 

student 
organizations 
and 

hearing concerns from students. 
These discussions allowed an 
estimation of how useful it 
would be for campus.

“We knew there was a need 

on campus so we wanted to do 
two things: meet that immediate 
need by providing students with 
meals, and also collect that data 
so that future data can be crafted 
that more directly target the 
populations that may need the 
program the most,” she said.

CSG also collaborated with 

other 
student 
organizations 

such as Maize & Blue Cupboard, 
a 
food 
pantry 
distributes 

resources through the Trotter 
Multicultural Center.

The emergency meal plan’s 

current model was developed 
after looking into the school’s 
own resources as well as other 
programs colleges statewide and

On Monday from 1 to 7 a.m., a 

team of eight students at Edible, an 

Ann Arbor startup, delivered 1,000 

care packages across Ann Arbor. 

The care packages — containing 

food products and distributed 

around residential areas, student 

housing, local businesses and 

University of Michigan buildings 

— were part of a new marketing 

stunt for the app, which aims to 

help users find local food that 

accommodates their dietary 

restrictions.

Edible CEO and co-founder 

Mike Copley, a University alum, 

brought the app to market last year 

with his team, including alum Ish 

Baid, chief technology officer and 

co-founder; LSA senior Lucas Ryan, 

who works with marketing and 

public relations; and Public Policy 

junior Elle Shwer, who works with 

branding and graphic design.

Baid wrote in an email 

interview the PR scheme proved 

successful — the app grew by nearly 

800 users. 

“We’ve been getting incredible 

growth,” he wrote. 

“Numbers are still coming 

in and we don’t have 

an exact figure, but we 

estimate over 1,000 users 

on campus by end of next 

week.”

Copley said in 

December the app 

crowdsources the 

information from its users, 

who list meals they have 

purchased, highlight the 

dietary restrictions that 

are accommodated at the 

restaurant and review their 

overall experience.

“It’s almost like Yik 

Yak the way we set up the 

feed,” he said. “So it’s just 

a list of menu items from 

various restaurants. Each one has 

upvotes and downvotes.”

Baid added the app caters to 

a sizable base in Ann Arbor — his 

team’s research estimates nearly 

one in four University students have 

dietary restrictions.

he said. “But it’s here and this 
is something that we’re dealing 
with.”

Recent raids have also occurred 

in Ypsilanti and Detroit.

Nicole Novak, University of 

Michigan postdoctoral fellow in 
the Population Studies Center, 
explained 
the 
similarities 

between current raids and a 2008 
raid that occurred in Postville, 
Iowa, which was at the time 
the largest raid to occur in U.S. 
history.

“That immigration raid (was) 

almost like an ethnic, city-specific 
or community-specific terrorist 
attack, because it had a lot of 
effects that we’re maybe seeing 
today,” she said. “People were 
trying to prepare for what might 
happen next.”

For many immigrants currently 

residing in the United States, the 
fear of being undocumented or 
of lacking citizenship status had 
never been as severe as it is now 
under the current administration. 
Because of this, many have 
taken measures to avoid being 
publicized by having their benefits 
canceled or by continuing to live 
without forms of identification.

University alum Maria Ibarra-

Frayre works for the Washtenaw 
County ID program where she 
helps serve those who do not 

have access to a form of state 
identification. Primarily, these 
services provide IDs to those who 
are undocumented, do not have 
a permanent address or do not 
have birth certificates. Recently, 
however, the fears of becoming 
identified have stopped many who 
would previously have tried to 
obtain this form of identification.

“People both are afraid to 

not have an identification and 
are afraid to get the ID because 
they’re afraid that this will put 
them in the database,” she said.

Panelists also spoke of the 

Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals, a two-year renewable 
permission 
enacted 
under 

President 
Barack 
Obama 
in 

June 2012 for those who were 
between the ages of 15 and 31. 
The permanence of the act 
remains in question given the 
Trump administration’s stance 
on 
immigration. 
Panelists 

highlighted its importance in 
recent years, specifically when 
promoting a sense of togetherness 
with recent waves of immigration.

“Part of me wants to believe 

that the reason (Trump) has not 
rescinded DACA is because the 
Trump administration is afraid of 
people who have DACA,” she said. 
“It’s been such a huge movement 
of undocumented youth who have 
gotten up and really claimed their 
status in the U.S. and were able 
to speak out against everything 
that had been happening with 
immigration,” Ibarra-Frayre said.

Panelists 
explained 
these 

youth, however, are currently 
facing even greater fears in regard 
to their families and the questions 
as to whether new policies will 
end up moving them to different 
locations or separating them from 
their loved ones.

“They’re not sleeping at night, 

they’re not showing up to school, 
they’re just deathly afraid that 
their parents are going to be 
taken away from them,” Flores 
said. “The greatest impact is the 
uncertainty of how this is all 
going to unfold and the damage 
path that’s going to be as a result 
of it.”

Panelists concluded by urging 

audience members to become 
involved in their communities, to 
take part in local nonprofits and 
to network with others passionate 
about advocacy and awareness.

LSA junior Donny Hearn 

III, who attended the panel, 
said he has found these types of 
events to be especially important 
for students when it comes to 
engaging in movements they 
learn about and start to feel 
strongly about.

“Especially in a university it’s 

important to take what you learn 
in the classroom and recognize 
that it’s a real-life issue,” he said. 
“By reading actual faces and 
actual people you can connect 
things you hear on the news and 
so forth with academia and I 
think actually make some sort of 
push to change reality.”

PANEL
From Page 1A

J. Alex Halderman’s email, from 
which racist messages were sent to 
computer science and engineering 
undergraduate 
students. 
The 

emails sparked protests across 
campus in the following weeks, 
with many Black students decrying 
a pattern of inflammatory racist 
incidents.

“I grew up being taught that 

the skin I am in is beautiful, and 
that I am capable of success,” the 
op-ed reads. “The thought that I 
will soon be confronted by people 
espousing the opposite messages 
terrifies me.”

Gardner-Brown 
recognizes 

while events of this nature do not 
reflect the values of the University 
campus, they are happening there 
nonetheless.

“In short, for them, being Black 

at a PWI (predominantly white 
institution) is getting worse,” she 
wrote.

Gardner-Brown said in a phone 

interview she had initially planned 
on another topic for her Dialogue 
piece, but after coming across the 
emails on Twitter, she changed her 
mind.

“I felt I need to write something 

about this,” Gardner-Brown said. 
“I was happy I got it out of my 
system, but at the same time I 
was hesitant to show the world, 
to write something so critical of 
the University before I even got a 
chance on campus.”

Alone in the Crowd
Affirmative 
action 
was 

dissolved at the University in 2006, 
when Gardner-Brown was still in 
elementary school. It was then she 
became aware of the prevalence 

of racial tension at the University, 
even among students for whom 
acceptance was a dream come 
true. When speaking with Black 
students on campus for her piece, 
she learned it was a complicated 
dynamic.

“Now don’t get me wrong, they 

love the campus, they love the 
educational experience,” Gardner-
Brown said. “However, when put 
in terms of the culture in terms of 
the segregation on campus, I have 
not met a single Black person or a 
single person of color who has told 
me they were able to feel safe all 
of the time. Their classmates are 
ignorant of issues that Black people 
are subject to. They are positive 
about campus as a whole, but not 
the racial tension.”

Engineering graduate student 

Aeriel Murphy is a member of 
Movement of Under-represented 
Sisters in Engineering and Science. 
Her high school and undergraduate 
experiences 
at 
the 
University 

of Alabama, she said, were very 
different than those Gardner-
Brown experienced.

“I think that her points are valid, 

but I just want her to know, if you 
go to Michigan State it’s still going 
to be a very similar story,” Murphy 
said. “Really, no matter where you 
go there’s going to be this feeling of 
uncertainty, a feeling of weariness. 
In Alabama, you didn’t have it 
in emails, you had it in people 
screaming at you on your way to 
the football games.”

When 
selecting 
a 
college, 

she advises, it is important for 
incoming minority students to do 
their homework in person.

“When students are visiting 

schools, ask if you can chat with 
students of color,” she said. “If the 
school is like, we don’t really have 

any, that’s a sign,” she said. “If you 
go to school, and you have a tour 
guide, more than likely they won’t 
be of your race.”

Elizabeth James, faculty adviser 

for the Black Student Union, said 
as an alum and current employee 
at the University, she believes the 
mental health of Black students on 
campus is a crucial issue.

“When I read the article, the 

first thing that popped in my head 
was the more things change the 
more they stay the same,” she 
said. “No matter where you are 
in the country you’re going to be 
combatting some of these issues.”

Trelawny 
Boynton, 
director 

of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs, 
wrote in an email interview she 
appreciates 
when 
current 
or 

prospective students share their 
concerns about the University as 
well as their hopes.

“The 
transition 
to 
a 
new 

community, especially a college 
community, can be challenging 
for students,” Boynton wrote. 
“It can be academic, social and/
or personal, and it will show up 
differently for each of us.”

James echoed these sentiments, 

and said she related to what 
Gardner-Brown wrote.

“That’s showing she has all 

the makings of a true academic,” 
she said. “She is doing the type of 
critical thinking that shows she has 
what it takes to make it here.”

Numbers Don’t Lie
Racial 
inequalities 
at 
the 

University are well-documented, 
especially 
since 
the 
#BBUM 

Twitter 
campaign 
garnered 

national attention in Nov. 2013. In 
2015, the ratio of Black to white 
students across the University 
measured 1,801 to 24,517, according 
to the Office of the Registrar.

That disparity — the difference 

of 4.1 percent against 56.2 — is 
difficult to conceptualize. In LSA, 
the largest college at the University 
with 19,338 students, the ratio was 
961 to 11,649 — not even one Black 
student to every thousand white. 
Broken down, there were 607 Black 
female students listed to 6,355 
white female students. For men, 
the ratio decreases to 354 to 5,294 
white male students.

This fall, the University boasted 

bolstered 
enrollment 
numbers, 

which in turn affected diversity 
numbers. The University indicated 
in a press release it had reviewed 
and processed 55,500 applications 
for the current freshman class, a 
7-percent increase from the last 
class’s 51,761. Black enrollment, 
however, still dropped from 5.1 
percent in 2015 to 4.6 percent for 
the class of 2020.

It has been found that simply 

increasing the number of students 
who enter the University cannot 
solve the problem of inequity and 
can, in fact, create new problems. 
In 2014, the University overshot 
the 
targeted 
freshman 
class 

size of 6,000 by a margin of 505 
that overburdened housing and 
instructional resources.

The Board of Regents crafted 

a plan to curb enrollment, such 
as 
reducing 
early 
admissions 

offers, hiring its first associate 
vice 
president 
for 
enrollment 

management and increased use 
of wait-listing. As a result, the 
number of freshmen entering 
campus decreased to 6,071 the 
following year.

“I believe that diversifying 

those primarily white campuses 
is crucial,” Gardner-Brown said. 
“That’s a part of the reason why I 
was so excited. Even the fact that 

I’m going to be one of the people 
that help change the campus. 
Honestly, people think the civil 
rights era was so long ago but it 
really wasn’t.”

Outside Ivory Towers
James said while recent events at 

the University were heartbreaking, 
she believed students responded 
with resilience. Though she does 
not believe the recent racially 
charged events were perpetrated 
by 
members 
of 
the 
campus 

community, she feels they are an 
unfortunate but necessary method 
of character building for Black 
students.

“You can’t escape outside,” she 

said. “It’s going to be there when 
you leave these ivory towers,” 
she said. “But when you leave 
Michigan, you have more in your 
portfolio that will assist you. It 
strengthens your spirit and your 
perspective so that you can say in 
any workplace in America, ‘I’m 
enough.’ Because you’ve had to first 
say it here.”

James said her mother, who 

attended the University during 
the height of the Jim Crow era, 
furnished her with advice that 
continues to be relevant today. 
Though she experienced more 
covert racism in the southern 
institutions 
she 
attended 

previously, James’s mother was 
met with a different type of 
discrimination 
that 
ultimately 

prepared 
her 
for 
the 
larger 

community.

Boynton 
said 
her 
advice 

for 
incoming 
students 
from 

minority 
backgrounds 
should 

avail themselves to the support 
systems at the University, such 
as a resident adviser in the 
residence hall, various student 
organizations and offices like 

MESA to support their transition.

“We are thrilled that she’s 

been accepted and look forward 
to meeting her and the incoming 
class,” Boynton wrote. 

Frontline Diversity Work
Gardner-Brown, 
who 
aims 

to pursue a global health major 
while at the University, said 
though she still has anxieties she 
is excited to matriculate with the 
class of 2021.

“I don’t think that people 

should not have opinions,” she 
said. “I just think that every 
opinion should be valued and I 
just don’t think that’s the case 
on campus and I would like to be 
part of changing that.”

James calls the phenomenon 

frontline diversity work — closing 
the 
space 
between 
differing 

groups increases the potential 
for progress. She referenced the 
success of a joint Shabbat dinner 
between Hillel and the Black 
Student Union.

“I was really proud of them,” 

she said. “That’s stepping out of 
your comfort zone, and really 
taking a look at another culture. 
We have to find a way to reach out 
and talk to one another. You can’t 
do it if everybody in the room is 
the same — you just can’t.”

Murphy said regardless of 

how much preparation incoming 
students have when transferring 
to 
a 
predominantly 
white 

institution, there will always be 
culture shock.

“The environment of support is 

going to be completely different,” 
she said. “As a student, as she goes 
out into the real world — you’re 
not going to meet people who look 
like you. You are going to work in 
an environment in which people 
are racist.”

nationwide have used. Colleges 
like Michigan State University 
have also set up food pantries that 
offer different food distribution 
methods in an attempt to address 
the problem, but many have 
found it difficult to cope with the 
increasing demand.

Regents at the University of 

California also recently launched 
a Global Food Initiative with 
a Food Access and Security 
Subcommittee, which includes 
measures such as vouchers for 
campus dining, expanding food 
pantry access and improving 
communication about resources. 
Students at Columbia University 
created an app called Swipes that 
connects people with meal plans 
to “receivers,” allowing them to 
use complimentary swipes to let 
other students into dining halls. 
Universities such as UW-Madison, 
New York University, Emory 
College and others have adopted 
similar policies.

“I sat down with several 

different student organizations 
that were working on this and we 

had this idea of a partnership with 
dining,” Sabada said. “We looked 
into some other school programs 
and this was the result of what 
we found worked best with the 
infrastructure we have here.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Skylar 

Burkhardt, who currently lives 
off-campus, acknowledged the 
lack of food resources on campus 
and brought up the fact that 
food insecurity is an issue a lot 
of students at the University deal 
with.

“I was in a program the other 

day where there was a simulation 
about 
food 
insecurities 
in 

developing countries, and a lot of 
people were very frustrated with 
it, and were talking about how they 
didn’t have to be demonstrated 
what food insecurity looks like, or 
what in general not having these 
privileges looks like because this 
is something they experience on 
a day-to-day basis.” Burkhardt 
said. “There is definitely a lack of 
cheap, healthy food resources in 
the downtown Ann Arbor area, so 
really if you’re living off-campus 
you have to drive or take a bus to 
get to these places.”

While Burkhardt admired the 

program and acknowledged it 
was a step in the right direction, 

she also felt it was a short-term 
solution to a much larger issue.

“It doesn’t seem like a very 

sustainable program, in that it’s not 
going to be solving their hunger in 
the future,” she said. “But I think 
as long as someone is getting the 
meal — it’s definitely a good cause 
to be working towards, and I 
think it’s really cool that they’re 
eliminating this disadvantage for 
the time being, but I’m curious to 
see if any long-term solutions will 
come up.”

Sabada also acknowledged the 

fact that the program wouldn’t 
be sustainable for the future, but 
added it is primarily being used 
to address immediate student 
concerns, as well as collects data so 
new initiatives can be launched in 
the future.

“We realize this program is not 

a long-term solution — it’s only 
six meals, and that doesn’t solve 
food insecurity on campus,” she 
said. “But we’re hoping to really 
meet that immediate need for 
students that are struggling now, 
helping them through this period 
and hopefully coming up with 
a program next semester that is 
more long-term and able to help 
students throughout the duration 
of their college career.”

rights leader; the Dalai Lama; and 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a South 
African anti-apartheid activist.

Stevenson began by detailing 

his journey as a Harvard Law 
graduate through the Southern 
criminal justice system, defending 
inmates on death row in an era 
of unprecedented growth in the 
country’s 
incarceration 
rate. 

Stevenson 
stressed 
the 
racial 

disparities present in the system 

— specifically the high rates of 
incarceration in Black and Latino 
populations — and pushed for more 
frank discussions of the United 
States’s history of racism.

“The United States is the most 

punitive society in the world … 
we have a criminal justice system 
that treats you better if you’re rich 
and guilty than if you’re poor and 
innocent,” he said. “We have to talk 
about the fact that we are living in a 
post-genocide society. I don’t think 
(the United States) is shameful 
enough for what we have done 
wrong.”

Stevenson at times connected 

the themes of racial and class 
equality and social justice to the 
current political climate in the 
aftermath of the 2016 presidential 
election. During his talk, he noted 
the high support for President 
Donald Trump in his home state 
of Alabama.

“When 
people 
say, 
‘Make 

America great again,’ I want to 
know what decade we’re talking 
about,” Stevenson said, drawing 
exuberant applause from the 
crowd.

“This 
University 
has 
a 

comprehensive history of civic 
engagement, but this dedication 
of citizenship is dependent on 
how the University prioritizes 
students’ ability to vote and 
participate in our democracy,” 
Galindez said. “As it stands, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

discourages students from voting 
by prioritizing class over civic duty 
and 
dis-incentivizing 
students 

from working the polls.”

Engineering senior A.J. Ashman, 

co-author 
of 
the 
resolution 

advocating for the holiday, echoed 
this statement, adding it was unfair 
for the administration to force 
students to make difficult decisions 
about their civic engagement and 
education.

“Students are residents of Ann 

Arbor; they have the right to have 
their voices heard,” he said. “It’s 
borderline morally unjustifiable to 
have a system where students have 
to choose between going to class, 
getting their education and being 

involved in the decision of their 
country’s state of power.”

Rackham Rep. Andy Snow was 

skeptical of the idea, saying he 
talked to constituents and they 
were not very receptive to the 
idea because a holiday on Election 
Day would result in the loss of Fall 
Break, or at least a part of it.

“Have 
you 
actually 
asked 

students specifically if they prefer 
this to Fall Break?” he said to the 
body.

I

t’s almost inarguable that 
today’s political climate 
is polarizing. But another 

polarizing 
sub-

climate 
is 
among 

activists who desire 
social 
change. 

During a classic 2 
a.m. 
conversation 

in the Fishbowl, a 
friend and I came to 
a conclusion. There 
are two prominent 
styles among those 
who 
mobilize 

communities 
to 

effect 
change: 

marchers 
and 

lobbyists. Marchers are the 
types 
of 
people 
who 
see 

the 
value 
and 
efficacy 
of 

public demonstrations as the 
most efficient allocation of 
their time. Lobbyists derive 
value from working within 
governmental institutions to 
effect change. Both styles are 
invaluable, but only when they 
work in tandem.

When the historic and global 

Women’s March took place on 
Jan. 21, I watched in awe as streets 
flooded with inspired and patriotic 
folks from all backgrounds. The 
passion in the air was infectious. 
However, in the days that followed, 
silence filled the lobbying sphere. I 
waited to hear any appeals made 
to government in the form of 
actionable change and real goals. 
My inner lobbyist was left hungry 
while my inner marcher felt full 
and satisfied.

Some argue this was the 

point of the Women’s March. 
In a compelling piece for the 
Independent, Kate Maltby reasons 
that the demonstration wasn’t 
designed to “change anything — 
but that’s not why we’re doing it.” 
She cites the cathartic relief of 
protesting as a main driver of the 
Women’s March. But wouldn’t it 
be great to harness the capacity 
for tangible change created as a 
healthy side effect?

When marchers nonviolently 

demonstrate and protest, they 
tap into a potential to make 
headlines, 
inspire 
reaction, 

spark 
dialogues 
and 
much 

more. These values are almost 
unique to the act of organizing 
and, as such, anyone desiring 
of change must recognize 
and 
appreciate 
marchers. 

But what marchers lack is an 
avenue to hold their audience, 
oftentimes 
governmental 

institutions, accountable.

This is where lobbyists come 

in. Lobbyists tailor the message 
of the march to finite and few 
requests of their audience. 
Whether it’s a meeting with 
a congresswoman or her staffer, 
and whether it’s in Washington 

D.C. or at the local district office, 
the meeting will always end in, 
“So these are our requests.” And 

the requests are a 
powerful tool; they do 
what protests cannot. 
The requests define a 
space within which 
the institution can 
work, as well as a goal 
that can be achieved.

Take my Muslim 

community 
as 
an 

example. For seven 
years 
we’ve 
held 

annual “Day on the 
Hill” events, meeting 

with more than 1,000 

elected officials and their staff 
to clear up misconceptions about 
Islam and advocate for global 
religious tolerance. Each year, 
more than 100 Muslims join 
the D.C. hustle and bustle as a 
part of the Ahmadiyya Muslim 
Community’s annual “Day on the 
Hill.” As #MuslimsOnTheHill, we 
combine lobbying and marching 
to put passion into action.

In 2014, our efforts came 

to fruition with the launch 
of the first and only Muslim 
caucus 
in 
Congress, 
the 

Ahmadiyya Muslim Caucus. 
The bipartisan-chaired caucus 
fights violations of religious 
liberties globally. This year, 
we were the largest Muslim 
group to meet with elected 
officials 
post-immigration 

ban. This means we shared 
with 
our 
nation’s 
leaders 

what the state of Muslim 
refugees 
and 
Islamophobia 

is like in the United States. 
Sharing personal stories gives 
a personality to a movement, 
which in turn begins breaking 
down 
identity 
politics. 

Furthermore, it incentivizes 
action and accountability. If 
a representative’s office feels 
personally 
connected 
to 
a 

movement through a physical 
handshake, they’ll care more 
about accomplishing those all-
important requests.

As 
my 
friend 
pointed 

out to me during our 2 a.m. 
conversation in the Fishbowl, 
we can’t just have lobbyists. 
In fact, it is essential for 
lobbyists to be able to reference 

some form of a movement for 
the sake of relevance.

For the #MuslimsOnTheHill, 

we referenced the grassroots 
TrueIslam.com campaign. The 
viral campaign, which seeks to 
clearly and concisely establish 
Islam’s true values, provided our 
Congressional 
representatives 

with two things. First, it showed 
our congresspeople the level of 
public interest in our message. 
After all, who would want to 
waste their office’s time, and 
taxpayer money, on unpopular 
ideas? And second, it gave 
our representatives a tangible 
action their office could take 
to support the movement, like 
becoming a #MuslimAlly. See 
that? The marcher’s grassroots 
campaign 
paired 
with 
the 

lobbyist’s 
specific 
requests 

harnesses potential for change 
more 
effectively 
than 
each 

working individually ever could.

Intermittently, lobbyists and 

marchers 
work 
in 
headline-

making tandem, as is evident 
with the influx in passionate 
town halls across the nation. 
Citizens are able to cathartically 
express 
their 
feelings 
while 

simultaneously 
holding 
their 

representatives accountable. In 
Ann 
Arbor, 
Students4Justice 

showed our campus how to 
combine the marcher mentality 
with the lobbyist mentality when 
the coalition coupled its sit-in 
with a thorough list of requests 
to “President Mark Schlissel, the 
Administration, and the Central 
Student 
Government 
of 
the 

University of Michigan.” Quite 
formally, 
the 
administration 

issued a thorough response to 
each point raised by S4J. Whether 
or not the response was adequate 
is up for debate. But what’s 
happening here is an exchange 
between activists, who want social 
change, and their administration.

So what does this mean for 

you? Well, it depends. If you 
haven’t been politically active 
about issues that affect us all, 
it’s time to start. If you have 
been politically active, then 
consider what else you can do. 
Lobbyists, look into supporting 
nonviolent protests. Marchers, 
think about setting up a meeting 
at your local representative’s 
office. If it’s an on-campus 
issue, consider teaming up 
with 
other 
students 
and 

organizations, both lobbyists 
and marchers of course, to take 
that crucial first step. Let’s all 
put our passion into action, and 
work in tandem with activists 
to effect positive and tolerant 
change in our society.

A

s we mentioned in our 
monthly 
speech 
Feb. 

16 before the Board of 

Regents, we believe that one 
“of the greatest dangers facing 
this campus … is a pervasive 
culture of apathy, whereby many 
students unaffected by (racist, 
white supremacist, Islamophobic 
and anti-Semitic) attacks do 
not engage in the critical and 
unending work that is necessary 
to advance a more just, fair and 
inclusive 
campus, 
University 

community and society.” 

All of us students, regardless of 

our backgrounds and identities, 
must care deeply about diversity, 
equity 
and 
inclusion-related 

work. We must embrace the 
notion of allyhood and embody its 
values through sustained action 
and activism, especially against 
the backdrop of the difficult 
year with which our campus and 
community have dealt.

Now, why is this the case? One, 

everyone deserves the chance to 
thrive and find a home — to feel 
safe and secure, respected and 
valued — on our campus. Two, 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
benefit all of us: Countless studies 
have shown us that progress 
and innovation are catalyzed 
when 
people 
with 
different 

lived and learned experiences, 
viewpoints and backgrounds 
come together to learn with 
and from each other.

For these reasons, over the 

past year, Central Student 
Government has put diversity, 
equity and inclusion at the 
forefront of our work. It guides 
our every decision and inspires 
each initiative and program that 
we launch — both inside and 
outside of the organization.

Let’s start by acknowledging 

that CSG has much more work to 
do in the area of diversity, equity 
and inclusion; the Demographic 
Report that we commissioned 
back 
in 
September 

highlighted the homogeneity 
of our organization. This is 
unacceptable for any organization, 
but especially one whose purpose 
is to represent every University of 
Michigan student.

We 
believe 
that 
part 
of 

this issue can be addressed 
by improving our Governing 
Documents, 
which 
currently 

outline 
how 
CSG 
Assembly 

seats 
are 
apportioned. 
To 

enhance these documents, and 
to strengthen the organization’s 
internal diversity, we convened 

a 
Constitutional 
Convention. 

The convention has proposed 
amendments, to be voted on by 
the student body in the upcoming 
March elections, that will create 
specialized seats for first-year, 
transfer 
and 
international 

students, which we believe will 
help to diversify CSG. 

We must also recognize that 

the best way to enhance CSG’s 
diversity is to expand the pool 
of people who get involved in 
the organization as candidates 
for the Assembly or members of 
a commission. Last month, for 
instance, we hosted a pre-election 
information meeting, with the 
goal of providing the opportunity 
for 
more 
students 
without 

any prior student government 
experience to become engaged 
in the election process. The 
meeting was a success, bringing 
together students from across 
the University with different 
histories 
of 
organizational 

involvement and leadership.

We are also proud to have 

executed our campaign promise 
of ensuring that members of 
the CSG Executive Team and 
Assembly undergo intergroup 
relations training. The foundation 
of this training is to build an 
understanding of how one’s social 
identities impact interpersonal 
relationships. 
It 
is 
likewise 

essential in fostering a more 
inclusive 
environment 
within 

CSG — an absolute necessity, 
as we continuously work with 
students of many different lived 
and learned experiences. 

Our administration has also 

overseen 
the 
re-emergence 

and growth of the Diversity 
and 
Inclusion 
Commission. 

This 
commission 
has 
been 

very 
effective, 
promoting 
a 

number of different initiatives 
and 
programs, 
including 

University 
recognition 
of 

Indigenous People’s Day and 
the establishment of the Student 
Support & Action Committee. A 
committee for and by students, 
the 
SSAC 
aims 
to 
provide 

continuous support for students 
through 
monthly 
activities 

designed to spread positivity 
throughout campus. Such events 
might include hosting group 
dialogues and the flyering of 
positive messages.

In 
efforts 
to 
encourage 

inclusivity, 
allyhood 
and 

continued support for students, 
CSG also launched a campus-
wide campaign in November 

called It Starts With Me. The 
campaign 
calls 
on 
students 

to stand against all forms of 
racism 
and 
discrimination. 

This campaign offers a way 
for students to step up, call in 
and try to make a difference 
through their actions. Thus far, 
students all across campus have 
participated in this campaign, 
from the men’s basketball team 
to the glee club.

Our proudest accomplishment 

in the area of diversity, equity and 
inclusion is the establishment 
of the Leadership Engagement 
Scholarship. This fund, the first 
of its kind at the University, acts 
as a “tool of equity” in that it 
seeks to level the playing field 
and support the extracurricular 
pursuits of University students 
with 
demonstrated 
financial 

need. Since we launched this 
initiative 
to 
the 
University 

community in October, with the 
help of University development, 
we 
have 
raised 
more 
than 

$150,000 for this scholarship. We 
deeply believe in the potential 
of this fund to strengthen intra-
organizational 
diversity 
and 

better the experiences of many 
deserving student leaders.

Much work remains to be 

done in the area of diversity, 
equity and inclusion, both within 
CSG and at the University. But, 
we remain hopeful. There are 
scores of dedicated faculty and 
staff members, administrators 
and, of course, students, who 
have worked tirelessly to elevate 
our shared community so that 
it better reflects our very best 
selves, our highest ideals and 
certainly the rich diversity of the 
greater society.

Going forward, it will be 

imperative that students of all 
backgrounds, identities and 
types of campus involvement, 
including future CSG leaders, 
hold the administration and its 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
strategic plan, which aims to 
“creat[e] a vibrant, diverse 
and inclusive campus,” to the 
highest standards. As long 
as we continue to do this — 
as long as we challenge the 
status quo and believe in the 
promise of tomorrow — we 
are confident in our ability as 
students to lead change and 
drive progress.

I, 
a 
young 

woman, enrolled in 
Women’s 
Studies 

220: Perspectives in Women’s 
Health in the winter semester 
of my freshman year, I thought 
I had women’s health figured 
out. I was curious about my 
own body. I searched anything 
I didn’t know and knew how to 
find the truth about the subject. 
Unlike many, I knew that people 
with vaginas don’t pee out of 
them. However, I hadn’t been 
in a sex-ed class since I was 
12. I was always taught that a 
woman’s body was just like a 
man’s with a few alterations 
and that there were just two 
anatomical types of bodies in 
the first place.

When I walked into the 

class, I was so confident in what 
I thought I knew that I was 
completely oblivious to the things 
I didn’t. As it turns out, women’s 
health is much more than what 
people think it is — and it’s often 
misunderstood 
or 
dismissed 

by almost everyone, even by 
professionals in the medical 
community. Despite feeling like 
I already had enough knowledge 
of the subject going into the 
class, I had never even heard of 
an intrauterine device, or an IUD 
(a pregnancy-preventing device 
inserted in the uterus), I didn’t 
know what a pap smear actually 
entailed and I didn’t know that 

doctors are less likely to take 
the pain of female patients 
seriously. I had also never fully 
considered 
the 
intersections 

of race, socioeconomic status 
and disability as they pertain to 
women’s health. Having certain 
identities can mean higher rates 
of infant mortality for your child; 
it can even mean not being seen 
as a woman at all.

Women’s bodies are ignored 

by science, objectified by society 
and seen as one-size-fits-all. 
Diseases that disproportionately 
affect women are not always 
studied 
specifically 
in 
the 

context 
of 
women’s 
health. 

In many public schools, sex 
education preaches abstinence 
relentlessly and ignores safe 
sex practices that can help 
women protect themselves. The 
definition of consent, and the 
realities of sexual assault, are 
rarely discussed.

Composing 
half 
the 

population and having bodies 
that are entirely their own, 
women deserve to know the 
vital information that pertains 
to their everyday lives. They 
deserve to know the flaws in 
the U.S. health care system; 
they 
deserve 
to 
feel 
they 

are receiving the best, most 
informed care they can get. It’s 
also vital for men to step up 
and to use whatever privilege 
in society they have to be 

informed and value women’s 
health and women’s bodies.

No one can assume full 

knowledge when it comes to 
women’s health — the field is 
too wide, and frankly, there’s so 
much information that not even 
the experts are fully confident 
in yet. Health is something that 
affects the lives of everyone, 
and because health classes 
today do not always include 
everyone 
(like 
transgender 

women), it is so important that 
we fill in the gaps where we 
can. Perspectives in Women’s 
Health was enlightening for 
me, but it’s ridiculous that I 
didn’t learn these vital things 
until my freshman year of 
college. 
Teaching 
women’s 

health, and teaching it as soon 
as possible, can answer some of 
the most important questions 
young women may have.

If you would like to learn 

more about women’s health, 
the women’s issues committee 
of the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Democrats 
and Students for Choice are 
hosting the Women’s Health 
Panel on Thursday, March 
9 from 8 to 9 p.m. in the 
Annenberg Auditorium of the 
Ford School.

Women’s health education is a necessity

‘Logan’ transcends genre

In latest iteration of Wolverine film series, ‘Logan’ manages to buck 
expectations, separating itself from other superhero films

To label “Logan” — the 

third in a trilogy of films 
centering on Hugh Jackman’s 
(“Les Misérables”) Wolverine 
— a “superhero movie” is to 
dramatically undervalue it. It 
surpasses the rest of the genre 
in a way that no film since 
Christopher 
Nolan’s 
2008 

masterpiece 
“The 
Dark 

Knight” has, and 
it 
possesses 
a 

confidence 
and 

willingness 
to 

break away from 
the norms of its 
contemporaries 
that makes it a refreshingly 
unique experience. “Logan” is 
not just a superhero movie. In 
some ways, maybe, but more 
so, it’s a western, a character 
piece and a moving study of 
violence, fatherhood, aging 
and redemption.

Make no mistake, “Logan” 

is an incredibly, oftentimes 
uncomfortably, 
violent 
and 

intense movie. It has plenty 
of the requisite action scenes 
that dial the blood and gore 
up to eleven, fully taking 
advantage of its R-rating. But 

where a film like “Deadpool” 
might use this over-violence 
for laughs, “Logan” is more 
interested with how it affects 
its 
leads, 
particularly 
its 

titular 
character. 
Even 
in 

its most violent, gruesome 
moments, “Logan” makes a 
remarkably mature statement 
on how violence can poison a 

person, regardless of whether 
the death is “justified.” This 
is clear from scene one: The 
life Wolverine has lead, one 
dominated 
by 
death 
and 

brutality, has finally taken its 
toll on him. He is a broken man 
holding onto the pain in his 
past and eventually using it to 
hurt himself.

In his last movie as Logan, 

Jackman 
brings 
that 
pain 

to life with his most weary, 

nuanced 
portrayal 
of 

the 
character 

to 
date. 
He 

is 
backed-up 

by 
a 
pair 
of 

equally 
superb 

supporting 
performances 

courtesy of Sir Patrick Stewart 
(“Green Room”) as Professor 
X and newcomer Dafne Keen 
in the best big screen debut 
a child actor has made since 
Jacob Tremblay in “Room.” 
Stewart is heartbreaking as 
he reprises the role of Charles 
Xavier, also for the final time, 
playing him as a man who has 
seemingly everything right yet 
still has had everything taken 
from him by age. The scenes 
he shares with Jackman are 
some of the most dynamic in 
the movie, and their father-
son relationship has never felt 
more heartfelt and real.

Keen 
plays 
Laura, 
a 

character destined to break 
out in the same way “Stranger 
Thing” ’s Eleven did last year, 
a girl who will gut a man one 
minute and serenely ride a 
mechanical horse the next. It is 
through Laura that the theme 
of violence reveals itself once 
more, as Logan recognizes 
the young girl heading down 
a similar path to the one he 
took. Where Jackman’s scenes 
with Stewart were focused 
on the pasts of the two 
characters, it is with Keen that 
Jackman finds Logan’s hope 
for redemption in his future, 
and the result is some of the 
most 
emotionally 
poignant 

storytelling the X-Men series 
and the genre at large has ever 

seen.

Performances and powerful 

thematic 
subtext 
aside, 

“Logan” still manages to set 
itself apart from its genre 
and series through its style. 
Its 
main 
characters 
may 

have superpowers, but the 
film still feels more like a 
western than anything else. 
The 
score, 
cinematography 

and even costume design all 
recall last year’s “Hell or High 
Water.” References to God 
and spirituality that dot the 
script present a motif that is 
a definite departure from the 
rest of the series, and could 
have felt like too radical a 
change had they not meshed so 
well with the western stylings 
and themes.

Everything 
taken 
into 

consideration, 
“Logan” 

is 
a 
triumph. 
Its 
subtle 

performances, powerful script 
and unique style all work in 
service of a deeply human story 
about superhuman characters 
desperately 
searching 
for 

atonement and paradise in 
a world that offers no hope 
that either exists. Even as the 
film flawlessly deconstructs 
Logan, it is obviously crafted 
with an enormous amount 
of love and respect for the 
character 
that 
permeates 

every frame. Whether it is 
taken as a superhero movie, 
an X-Men movie, or a western, 
“Logan” shines. It is the best 
any of those genres have to 
offer, nothing less than a 
masterpiece.

Four seasons of ‘Americans’

In 
celebration 
of 
“The 

Americans” 
fifth 
season 

premiere, The Michigan Daily’s 
TV editors found yet another 
excuse to rave about the series. 
Fair warning: Spoilers lie ahead.

Is “The Americans” timely 

now?

The last time we checked 

in with our favorite couple, 
we were safely ensconced in 
a markedly different political 
climate, to say the least. Sure, 
Trump was a thing back then 
(and I guess he is now, too?), 
but when season four of “The 
Americans” 
premiered, 
the 

political 
landscape 
at 
large 

wasn’t nearly as concerned with 
The Russian FederationTM as 
it is at present. It’s fascinating 
to consider the contemporary 
relevance of a show that initially 
— to summarize generously 
— casually functioned as an 
exercise in humanization, as 
a fairly pointed critique of 
decades of American hostility to 
that cold country up north.

OK, relevance might be too 

extreme; this is a spy thriller 
show about KGB operatives 
posing 
as 
an 
all-American 

family, after all. But perhaps 
it’ll change the way we watch 
it. Normally, it’s the metaphor 
and character work that hits 
uncomfortably close to home; 
now, the foreign policy that 
once seemed laughably outdated 
has been showered with a 
liberal dose of “just kidding.” 
This renewed context, which 
has repurposed the show as, on 
a surface-level, more current 
than 
it 
originally 
seemed, 

is more than a little eerie — 
nonetheless, hopefully it’s a 
jolt of ratings vigor for a series 
that is criminally underseen 
yet 
massively, 
maddeningly 

brilliant.

Another kind of love story
Let’s 
talk 
about 
love. 

Apparently, it’s not that simple 
when you’re an undercover KGB 
officer living in ’80s America. 
Who would have thought? In 
fact, love, or rather the illusion 
of it, is just an arrangement 
for Elizabeth and Philip when 
we first meet them in season 
one. 
Their 
white-picket-

fence marriage is a spectacle 
solidified by two children and 
a travel agency, completing an 
anything-but-suspicious picture 
of American suburbia. But, like 
any good love story, this is just 
the beginning. 

The generic, heart-shaped 

box of Dove chocolates brand 
of love isn’t what you’ll find in 
“The Americans.” In fact, by 
definition, happily ever after is 
practically impossible. When 
emotionally 
(and 
sexually) 

manipulating others is part 
of your job description, those 
unwritten rules that govern 
a successful partnership are 
pretty much obliterated. But 
that’s 
exactly 
why 
I 
keep 

coming back for more of Philip 
and 
Elizabeth’s 
relationship: 

Its complications are totally 
unprecedented which, in turn, 
examine what it really means 
to know someone at their core. 
After four seasons, I believe 
that they really do love each, 
although what that means for 
them is (hopefully) different 
than what it means for most 

people. Amidst all the lies, 
secrets and general twistiness, 
the duo play on such a dynamic 
range of emotion, colored in 
nuances and metaphors, that 
their love is still somehow 
relatable.

On a tangent, Matthew Rhys 

and Keri Russell are together 
in real life, and I’m a little too 
excited about it.

— Danielle Yacobson, TV Beat 

Editor

Subversion of gender roles
There’s little else we can do 

here at The Michigan Daily 
to evangelize for Keri Russell 
and Matthew Rhys than to 
keep telling you how amazing 
they are at what they do. So, 
for posterity: They’re amazing 
at what they do. What is 
consistently 
mind-boggling, 

however, 
is 
the 
ease 
with 

which their two characters can 
play with, subvert, undercut, 
obliterate 
any 
assumptions 

about presupposed gender roles 
— especially for a show set in 
the ’80s.

At first glance, there’s an 

easy categorization to make: 
Elizabeth is the cold, calculating 
murderer while Philip is the soft, 
reluctant father. The problem 
is, that’s just a bad take. The 
two principals are so complex 
and dynamic that pinning them 
down on either sides of a binary 
is an exercise in futility. Both are 
capable of unspeakable cruelty, 
and both are capable of tender, 
understated 
warmth. 
What 

binds them is an unwavering 
loyalty to their family. Elizabeth 
is not the standard ’80s-era 
housewife, nor is she that 
cliched 
overcorrection 
of 
a 

heartless female killer; Philip is 
the affable dad with a nagging 
reluctance to keep committing 
crimes in the name of the 
Soviet Union, but he’s also a 
man who is forced into morally 
questionable 
scenarios 
and, 

despite his misgivings, carries 
them to completion. Take, for 
instance, the unsettling sex 
scene between Elizabeth and 
“Clark” in season three. It’s 
disturbing, challenging, a splash 
of cold water for anyone who 
assumes to know how to classify 
these two protagonists. Philip 
turns horrifyingly violent, and 
the scene ends with Elizabeth 
crying on the bed. We know the 
sexual history between these 
two, and we know, specifically, 
Elizabeth’s 
own 
traumatic 

experiences. And so, Clark asks: 
“Is this what you want?”

— Nabeel Chollampat, Senior 

Arts Editor

Not just another teenager
Coming of age — a horribly 

vague 
expression 
flung 

around far too frequently — 
is nevertheless what makes 
teenagedom 
so 
universally 

cinematic. 
We 
hear 
“high 

school,” and we expect to 
witness a variety of awkward 
“firsts” and an inevitable social 
commentary on what it means 
to grow up. “The Americans,” 
however, 
doesn’t 
bother 
so 

smother teeange Paige Jennings 
with the typical, melodromatic 
angst. Even before Paige was let 
in on the whopper of a family 
secret, she was no ordinary 
sneak-out-of-the-house, smoke-
a-joint-behind-the-bleachers 
kind of kid. A genuine curiosity, 
instead, is what catalyzed her 
gut-wrenching 
discovery 
of 

her parents’ true identities, 
and has continued to challenge 
the narrative’s explorations of 
ideology, morality and truth. 
But curiosity killed the cat, 

right?

Paige has always stirred the 

pot in the Jennings household. 
Remember 
when 
she 
told 

Elizabeth and Phillip, both 
sworn 
atheists 
discretely 

attempting to subvert their 
children to Soviet communism, 
that she wanted to be baptized 
in the church? Yeah, that didn’t 
go over well. But it was the first 
true depiction of her outstanding 
grit that continues to surprise 
and subvert expectations of the 
community-action driven, doe-
eyed girl who snooped around 
the garage when nobody was 
looking in the first season. Now, 
on the other side of the façade, 
Paige’s 
previously 
steadfast 

morality begins to blur: She 
emotionally 
manipulates 

Pastor Tim (who is somehow 
still alive) to keep the family’s 
secret and uses her sexuality to 
wriggle out information from 
FBI Agent Stan’s son. These 
tricks of the trade, all-too-
familiar in Elizabeth’s work, 
are a melancholy reminder of 
how twisted the whole thing 
really is. Yet, with a poignant 
maturity 
and 
relentless 

questioning, Paige also captures 
a brand of “growing up” that 
is, well, normal: The inevitable 
disillusionment 
children 

experience when their parents 
are revealed to be something 
less than absolutely perfect.

Who’s 
“good” 
on 
“The 

Americans”?

Four seasons in, and I still 

don’t know if we’re supposed 
to 
empathize 
with 
Philip 

and 
Elizabeth. 
They’re 
our 

protagonists, yes, and we’re 
intrinsically rooting for them 
not to die — but are they “good 
people”? 
Whatever 
moral 

calculus one has to compute to 
come down on either side, our 
central couple has, objectively, 
done some truly messed up shit. 
Philip’s deeply uncomfortable 
seduction of a teenager in season 
three is a squirm-inducing run 
of ethical complications, for 
both Philip and the audience; 
Stan and Nina’s illicit romance 
was a no-win situation for both 
of them (one more than the 
other, I guess); and Elizabeth’s 
heartbreaking betrayal of Young 
Hee and her family is horrifying 
in its perversity.

But 
none 
are 
more 

emotionally 
wrenching 
than 

what was done to our poor, 
sweet, lovable idiot Martha. It 
was funny at first, watching 
a blatantly oblivious woman 
get strung along to the point of 
literally getting married to a 
Philip in a bad wig. But as the 
vultures’ circles grew smaller 
and the stakes grew higher, 
Martha’s predicament became 
something to cry for instead. 
We (and Philip) were forced to 
reckon with the profound and 
fundamental loneliness a person 
must feel to endure what she did. 
We grappled with the continued 
and consistent devaluation of 
her person, until everything 
came to a head and, fittingly, 
this woman who had nothing 
else in her life was shipped off to 
her unknown fate in Cuba. Were 
we implicit in Philip’s / Clark’s 
moral bankruptcy? In cheering 
for 
their 
survival, 
are 
we 

culpable for turning a blind eye 
to the horrible things Elizabeth 
and Philip are forced to do to 
ensure it? “The Americans” asks 
uneasy questions of its viewers, 
but it’s impossible to look away.

Red curry paste and the 
virtues of risk-taking

Let’s 
face 
it: 
Cooking 

weeknight 
dinners 
can 
be 

pretty bleak. Getting to the 
grocery store can be tough, 
especially when the closest 
ones around are only accessible 
by car. This obstacle can make 
getting creative with a meal 
or 
spontaneously 
trying 
a 

new recipe difficult. Not to 
mention, who has the time?

However, using a little trick 

of mine, it’s possible to 
shake up your weekly 
routine with minimal 
effort. A single novel, 
adaptable 
pantry 

staple 
can 
easily 

transform any dinner, 
from 
sheet 
pan 

chicken and veggies 
to hearty soups. To 
kick a tired dinner up 
a notch, I’ve taken to 
using red curry paste. 
Though 
traditional 

recipes call for nearly a dozen 
ingredients, 
beaten 
to 
a 

creamy, vibrant mixture with a 
mortar and pestle, the bottled 
variety 
available 
at 
most 

grocery stores will do just fine 
— especially if you’re of limited 
means and time in the kitchen 
(side note: this is one of the 
rare occasions I advocate for 
anything storebought).

I 
first 
stumbled 
across 

strikingly colored paste, typical 
of most Thai curry dishes, 

while wandering the enticing, 
yet less commonly frequented 
food 
aisle 
containing 
rice 

noodles, fish sauces, canned 
chiles and kosher wines. Try as 
I might, I often stray from my 
modest, carefully composed 
grocery list when presented 
with the items in this aisle. I 
eagerly peruse the aisle with 
vivid 
dreams 
of 
whisking 

up authentic local cuisine — 

despite my minimal 
experience 
with 

these 
ingredients 

far 
outside 
the 

realm 
of 
my 

comfort 
zone. 

Their 
potential 

captures 
my 

curiosity, 
luring 

me 
with 
the 

possibility 
of 

trying my hand at 
a new, invigorating 
dish. 
Endless 

possibilities lay within the 
shelves 
of 
those 
aisles 
— 

anchored by the unfamiliar 
packaging and indecipherable 
lettering of foods far more 
exotic from the bland dishes 
I’ve grown accustomed to (and 
tired of).

Though I often marvel at 

these ingredients, and all the 
exciting 
new 
possibilities 

they hold, I often succumb 
to the overwhelming feeling 
of ineptitude in the face of 
learning to incorporate them 
into my standard fare. Feeling 
bold one day, I purchased the 
red curry paste. I had neither 
a recipe in mind, nor any idea 
how to use it in a dish, driven 
by an inkling that my bet 
would pay off. It’s remained a 
staple in my fridge ever since.

Given my unfamiliarity with 

methods of incorporating the 
spice into traditional curry 
dishes, I opted for a more 
improvised use. After mixing 
with 
shallots 
and 
garlic 

sizzling in vegetable oil until 
soft and fragrant, I add a can of 
coconut milk for a sweet, rich 
flavor and silky consistency. 
Once simmering, you can add 
any variety of vegetables — I 
used spinach, thinly sliced bell 
peppers, chickpeas and roasted 
sweet 
potato 
or 
eggplant 

(note: the sweet potato can 
be cooked until tender in the 
sauce, or roasted in the oven 
until just crisp for a sweeter, 
deeper flavor). The wilted 
greens add a nutty flavor that 
complements the sweetness of 
the coconut milk and heat of 
the curry, and the chickpeas 
and bell peppers can be cooked 
until just beginning to lose 
their crunch. This allows them 
to maintain their texture while 
adding a satisfying variety 
to consistency of the stewed 
ingredients. A pinch of salt 
and pepper can be added, 
but definitely isn’t needed 
— the curry paste packs its 
own unique flavor. I also had 
some 
cumin, 
paprika 
and 

cinnamon on hand, and threw 
a few dashes of those in as 
well for a sweeter, smokier 
flavor. As versatile a dish as 
the ingredient that serves as 
its foundation, it can be eaten 
plain or over a bowl of rice (or 
any grain of your choosing). If 
you have a protein like chicken, 
shrimp or tofu on hand, I would 
recommend adding it as well 
by cooking in the pan before 
adding the shallots and garlic, 
and seasoning lightly with salt 
and pepper, then adding the 
remaining ingredients in.

An ingredient that once 

seemed so daunting became 
one of my pantry staples. 
The paste is not only a handy 
tool to amplify any meal, 
but incredibly easy to use 
— even for kitchen novices. 
A 
little 
adventurousness 

can certainly go a long way. 
I’ve experimented with the 
paste, rubbing it on acorn and 
butternut squash and roasting 
until tender and caramelized. 
The blend of spices pairs well 
with almost any vegetable, 
grain dish or soup and has a 
nice added kick of heat that is 
balanced by the slight acidic 
bite of lemongrass and kaffir 
lime.

Sometimes, the unexpected 

harmony between the surprise 
of an uncommon ingredient 
and the comfort an adaptable 
dish is all it takes to alter a dull 
routine.

After a long, dark winter, 

Lorde is back. The first sin-
gle off her highly anticipated 
sophomore album, Melodra-
ma, “Green Light” 
takes the power-
house 
songwrit-

ing that solidified 
Lorde’s status as a 
modern pop diva 
into sonically new 
directions.

The quick, pulsing beats are 

familiar to the pop genre, but 
foreign to the singer, who came 
closest to a dance song with 
“Tennis Court.” It seems one 
DJ’s trash is Jack Antonoff’s 
treasure. Antonoff, who is 
credited as both a writer and 
producer, brings a dark dance-
pop sound similar to “I Don’t 
Wanna Live Forever,” his last 
production credit. Both songs 
live in a dreamy, smoke filled 
club. “Green Light,” however, 
employs more of the bursting 
choruses and hand-clapping 
sounds of Antonoff’s “We Are 
Young” days.

Lorde’s moody, mysterious 

lyrics are still the crux of her 
power. The song refuses to be 
pinned down, building a mys-
tery deeper that its titular, 
Gatsby-esque green light. At 
once, she paints a starkly real 
portrait of modern woman-
hood, opening the track with 
the line: “I do my makeup in 

somebody else’s 
car,” and spins 
a beautiful web 
of half-finished 
metaphors, 
bleeding 
talk 

of great white 

sharks (her teeth obsession is 
back in full force on this track) 
into lost love and dance floor 
memories. She collages sharp 
scenes into a tangled plot. 
Much like “Ribs” or “400 Lux” 
from Pure Heroine, the song’s 
melancholy 
isn’t 
instantly 

apparent, only showing itself 
on the fifth or sixth listen.

Fortunately, Lorde knows 

we’ve 
already 
listened 
(at 

least) 100 times. This is the 
moment we’ve all been waiting 
for, all of us who know exactly 
where we were when someone 
first showed us “Royals,” dur-
ing its shot to fame in the sum-
mer of 2013. If “Green Light” 
is any indication of what we 

can expect from Melodrama, 
Lorde is growing into her role 
as the pop diva for the Tumblr 

generation, refining her sound, 
harnessing her ineffable voice.

Berenson mulls retirement, leaves future open

Red Berenson sat in his chair 

and leaned forward. After another 
practice 
skating 
around 
and 

offering instructions, Berenson 
untied his skates and placed his 
stick on the floor next to him. 
Even at the age of 77 with 33 
years at the helm of the Michigan 
hockey team, Berenson still skates 
on the ice nearly every day. 

Monday, Berenson pondered 

his 
future 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, 

something he said he thinks about 
constantly.

He intended to retire last 

year, which he planned at the 
beginning of that season. But with 
a new athletic director in Warde 
Manuel, Berenson opted to stay to 
aid Manuel’s transition.

“He didn’t wanna go through 

hiring a coach — he hadn’t 
even moved into his house yet,” 
Berenson said. “And our team 
played well and I thought they 
were responding well, so the 
reasons to stay were those things.

“We’ll revisit all this at the end 

of the year, but I’m trying not to 
worry about it right now. It’s just a 
matter of when — whether it’s this 
year or next year.

Physically, the 77-year-old is 

content.

Mentally, though, things are a 

bit more complicated.

Berenson constantly thinks 

about the consequences of his 
decision and its implication for 
the Wolverines of the present and 
the future. As Michigan begins 
recruiting with athletes as young 
as sophomores in high school, the 
uncertainty of a program’s head 
coach could impact a recruit’s 
decision.

“There’s always the question of 

‘Who’s gonna be the coach when 
I get there,’ ” Berenson said. “I 
tell all these kids I probably am 
not gonna be your coach — and 
I probably won’t. Kids get down 
between two different schools 
and there’s always the question 
of who’s gonna be the coach at 
Michigan. … But we’ll re-visit all 

of that.”

Still, it’s a question that looms 

ever 
larger 
now, 
especially 

with the Wolverines facing a 
tumultuous end of the season. 
Michigan’s final home series 
is slated against a difficult 
11th-ranked Nittany Lion team 
that outscored the Wolverines 
11-2 in State College. After the 
Penn State series, Michigan 
begins play in the Big Ten 
Tournament, where it would 
need to win out in order to reach 
the NCAA Tournament.

It is a stark contrast from 

last season. At this point, the 
Wolverines dominated conference 
play and led the nation in scoring. 
Now, the Wolverines will try to 
play the role of spoiler, something 
that motivates Berenson in a 
season when a postseason bid is 
unlikely.

“It’s gotta be a must win series 

for Michigan, just to get our 
game where we think it can be,” 
Berenson said. “We’ve seen bits 
and pieces of it, but we haven’t 
seen enough of it. I don’t think 
our fans have seen us sweep a 
team maybe once all year, and 
obviously the Friday game is the 
game. That’s the game that gets 
you going or puts your back up 
against the wall.

“We’re 
trying 
to 
get 
to 

Joe Louis Arena with some 
momentum. … So we gotta get 
a little more confidence, a little 
more momentum, and a little 
more of everything.”

Thinking in the big-picture — 

should this season be his last — 
Berenson emphasized his desires 
for his players to succeed in every 
area of their lives, should a career 
in hockey not pan out. During 
his professional career, Berenson 
took classes in the summer at 
Michigan and eventually earned 
his Master’s Degree in Business 
Administration in 1966.

It is a testament to the emphasis 

Berenson places on education for 
all his players and the reason he 
admires all of those who leave 
Ann Arbor — even the players 
who end up in other non-hockey 

pursuits.

“They all got the same message, 

and they all know I cared about 
them,” Berenson said. “I cared 
about the fact that they went 
to school and they would have 
something to fall back on. I’m 
proud of the guys who went to the 
NHL, but I’m just as proud of the 
guys that aren’t.

“We get neurosurgeons and 

lawyers and doctors, you name it. 
… All kinds of guys who were good 
players and became really good 
citizens too.”

Nearly 33 years ago, Michigan 

athletic director Don Canham 
introduced Berenson, hoping to 
return the Wolverines to their 
successful run of the 1950’s. 
Three decades later, Berenson 
remains in Ann Arbor with two 
NCAA 
championships, 
which 

shocks him to this day.

“I had no idea I’d be here 33 

years,” Berenson said. “You get 
caught up in the kids and the 

recruiting more kids, and pretty 
soon it’s like a big family and you 
feel responsible. So I’ve never 
really looked for a job since I got to 
Michigan. I’ve had opportunities 
but I’ve never wanted to leave. So 
it’s been good, and I hope it’s been 
good for Michigan.”

And while it may be tempting 

to consider when Berenson will 
come to an ultimate decision 
about his future, it’s not his 
primary concern. This weekend, 
Berenson will focus on honoring 
his seniors in their last games 
at Yost. And next week, the 
Wolverines will travel to the Joe 
Louis Arena in hopes of earning 
a long-shot bid to the NCAA 
tournament.

“We’ll see about the outcome or 

when this is over,” Berenson said. 
“Right now, our team doesn’t have 
a lot to play for except pride and 
trying to get some momentum for 
the Big Ten Tournament. That’s 
our focus right now.” 

Seniors leave impact

Jack LaFontaine remembers 

his most challenging morning of 
the season. It had been a sleepless 
night on the plane for the freshman 
goaltender, as he struggled to 
get over his performance in the 
Michigan hockey team’s loss to 
Dartmouth on Oct. 29.

He woke up that Sunday 

morning to a text message from 
a player who urged him to move 
past that experience. The message 
came from fellow netminder Zach 
Nagelvoort, who, in his fourth year 
on the Wolverines, has asserted a 
more active role for Michigan.

“He texted me, ‘Hey come over, 

let’s get some air, let’s walk, to get 
your mind off it,’ ” LaFontaine said. 
“I’ll never forget that, that’s what 
really stands out to me about the 
type of person he is.

“He’ll share one little thing 

of wisdom with me and then I’ll 
go home and I’ll write it down 
because I want to remember it for 
tomorrow. Not only that, but how 
to handle myself off the ice, and 
how to overcome challenges and 
adversity.”

Heading into the Wolverines’ 

final home series, emotions seem 
to run high for LaFontaine and his 
fellow freshman. The seniors who 
motivated them and encouraged 
them for the past months will be 
departing soon.

Nagelvoort certainly isn’t the 

only senior who makes the effort 
to guide his young teammates. 
Seniors from the front three like 
forward Alex Kile to defensemen 
Nolan de Jong and Kevin Lohan 
have 
helped 
the 
newcomers 

overcome their initial uneasiness 
in Ann Arbor.

For the first few months of the 

season, freshman Will Lockwood 
played alongside Kile, his family 
friend growing up. He credits 
part of his early season success to 
starting games with the senior as 
his linemate.

Kile’s duties as a leader extended 

beyond those on his line. With the 
assistance of the other forwards, 

Kile welcomed the new players 
into the fold and taught them the 
“Michigan tradition.”

“We like to see ourselves as a 

family on the ice and off the the 
ice, and team chemistry is really 
important,” 
Lockwood 
said. 

“Getting along with everyone is 
a huge factor in how the games 
go. They really taught me how to 
respect my teammates, to be the 
person you want to be here in Ann 
Arbor.”

Behind the front three, de Jong 

and Lohan man the blue line and 
do their part to motivate and offer 
assistance to the young group of 
Wolverines defensemen.

Freshman 
Luke 
Martin 

explained that the two constantly 
offer advice and small post-
practice reminders from working 
on improving skate speed to 
cleaning skates and putting away 
equipment.

Like 
LaFontaine 
did 
from 

Nagelvoort, Martin learned some 
specific lessons not easily seen 
on the ice during games from De 
Jong — Michigan’s captain — and 
Lohan, the alternate.

“Something I’ve learned from 

Kevin is take care of your body as 
much as you can because it’ll pay 
off in the long run,” Martin said. 
“(He) is always the last guy in the 
weight room, whether rolling out 
and stretching or icing his back 
down in the cold tub.

“Nolan is always in there 

warming up early, getting ready to 
go for practice and games. … He’s 
very calm, nothing seems to really 
rattle him. He’s never too high on 
his highs and never too low on his 
lows.”

Saturday night, Michigan will 

honor its seniors at center ice. The 
younger Wolverines will reflect 
on lessons learned at practices, 
during pre-game skates, in the 
games and on the bench. Some, like 
LaFontaine nearly did Tuesday 
after practice, may see their 
emotions get the best of them.

But most of all, they’ll thank 

the seniors for their efforts to 
mentor them over the course of a 
challenging season. 

Wolverines must refocus before 
possible NCAA Tournament run

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team still has a chance 
to become the best team in 
program history. Currently, the 
Wolverines sit at 22 wins — tied for 
the most ever. But with the NCAA 
tournament looming around the 
corner, they have an opportunity 
to win the elusive 23rd game. 

While Michigan lost four of 

its last five matchups, it is still 
very likely to be selected for the 
NCAA 
Tournament. 
Selection 

Monday will be on Mar. 13, and 
the Wolverines will be in line for 
an at-large bid. With 32 schools 
gaining automatic entry into the 
tournament, there are 32 more 
teams chosen by a committee to 
compete with, and Michigan’s 
three weeks in the Associated 
Press Top 25 rankings may be an 
essential factor in the selection 
process.

Despite the positive NCAA 

tournament 
outlook, 
the 

Wolverines’ Big Ten Tournament 
loss to Michigan State was a 
crushing blow that illuminated 
their key weaknesses. In order for 

Michigan to accomplish its 23-win 
goal, it will have to correct some of 
its shortcomings.

The Wolverines had already 

played the Spartans on Feb. 19, 
falling, 86-68 — their worst loss 
aside from a 20-point defeat to No. 
9 UCLA on Dec. 11. In the rivals’ 
Big Ten Tournament rematch last 
Friday, the Spartans won by just 10 
points.

“Our kids really bought into 

the game plan,” said Michigan 
assistant coach Melanie Moore on 
WTKA. “And we did an excellent 
job of guarding (Michigan State 
guard Tori Jankoska) who, the 
first time we played them, I think 
scored 28 points on us. The kids 
were really locked in and we 
threw different defenders on 
them from (junior forward Jillian 
Dunston) to (senior guard Siera 
Thompson). But unfortunately, 
they had some other kids that 
stepped up and made shots, and 
it was just hard for us to get back 
after that.”

Even though the Wolverines 

were able to slow down certain 
members of the Spartan offense, 
they could not account for the 
scoring contributions of eight 

different 
players. 
Michigan, 

meanwhile, had just five players 
tally points, and just seven of 
those points didn’t come from 
the team’s three leading scorers: 
junior guard Katelynn Flaherty, 
sophomore center Hallie Thome 
and 
freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick. 
The 
Wolverines 

did not display Michigan State’s 
depth, and relying on their core 
scorers simply wasn’t enough.

Free throws were another 

deciding factor in the game. 
The Spartans made 10 more 
free throws — and 11 more 
opportunities — than Michigan, 
which also equaled the game’s 
margin of victory.

“We were trying,” Moore said. 

“We got people on our hips, and 
we were trying to be aggressive 
and attacking. We just weren’t 
getting the foul. So we were trying 
then to move the ball, go inside to 
Hallie. It just wasn’t happening. 
So we were telling the kids, ‘Crash, 
crash hard, try to get a second or 
third opportunity.’

“Unfortunately, we just didn’t 

go to the line as much as Michigan 
State, and that was probably the 
difference when you look at the 
box score.”

Not getting to the foul line is 

one thing, but the Wolverines also 
got themselves into foul trouble, 
which forced some of their talent 
off the court in crucial parts of the 
game.

“Unfortunately for us, we had 

almost every starter with two 
fouls early in the first half,” Moore 
said. “When Hallie picked up her 
second early in the second quarter, 
we had to sit her, and that allowed 
Michigan State to go on a run.”

While the loss was a tough 

pill for Michigan to swallow, it 
will have ample time to refocus 
before the NCAA Tournament. If 
the Wolverines earn an at-large 
bid, they will start playing the 
weekend of Mar. 17.

And they certainly haven’t 

given up.

“They’re excited,” Moore said. 

“They can’t wait to get back in the 
gym, and they feel like they have 
unfinished business.”

Sophomore center Hallie Thome faced foul trouble against the Spartans.

Michigan finishes 2-1 during trip

In just the sixth year of varsity 

men’s lacrosse at Michigan, it 
took just seven games for Coach 
John Paul’s group to eclipse the 
program’s record for wins in a 
season. 

The Wolverines (6-1 overall) 

got their record-setting sixth 
victory Saturday at Furman, 
aided by sophomore midfielder PJ 
Bogle’s first career hat trick in a 
7-5 triumph.

“It helps to have a breakout 

game where I can get the ball out 
of my stick a lot and have it end 
up in the back of the net,” Boyle 
said. “It reinforced that I can 
trust my teammates to get me the 
ball inside and that I can trust 
the offense that (assistant) coach 
(Conor) Ford has us running. 
Having a game like that certainly 
will help me going forward.”

Boyle credited Michigan’s first 

possession — which lasted nearly 
four minutes — and trust in the 
offensive game plan with giving 
him the confidence to pepper the 
net with 10 shots on the afternoon. 
The Wolverines’ eighth-leading 
scorer was the most active player 
offensively on a day in which the 
usual suspects didn’t markup the 
scoring column.

Sophomore 
Tommy 
Heidt, 

who won a preseason four-
way battle to be the starting 
goaltender, made seven key saves 
in the fourth quarter to hold off 
the Paladins.

“He did a big part in bailing us 

out late in the game today when 
Furman was in desperation time,” 
Paul said. “They got some good 
looks, and he made some pretty 
spectacular saves. It’s comforting 
to have a guy back there that 
isn’t only making the saves he’s 
supposed to make but also robs 
the other team throughout the 
game. That’s what Tommy’s 
doing.”

Added Heidt: “Our defense 

bared down (in the fourth) and 
tried to force the opposition to 
take shots that I like and we like.”

Michigan’s defense of a perfect 

record looked possible against 
No. 5 Notre Dame on Feb. 26, as 
the team trailed by just three 

goals at halftime. But the Fighting 
Irish used a 51-24 shot advantage 
to score nine goals in the second 
frame and win in lopsided 
fashion, 16-5.

Eighteen turnovers plagued 

the Wolverines and overwhelmed 
the defense, as Heidt’s 17 saves — 
good for the fourth-most all-time 
by a Wolverine in a single game — 
weren’t enough to stall an Irish 
team that dominated possession. 
The contest demonstrated that, 
while Michigan players have 
been able to see the fruits of 
Ford’s game plan, the offense 
hasn’t 
found 
the 
necessary 

cohesion in order to defeat elite 
teams.

“We didn’t have a lot of smart 

possessions and weren’t running 
what we wanted to,” Paul said. 
“We want smarter and better 
offense and make better choices 
with the ball.”

Though the offense showed 

signs 
of 
diversification 
with 

Boyle’s hat trick, senior attacker 
Ian King continues to hit the back 
of the net and amass assists. He 
moved to the top of the program’s 
all-time points list with a helper 
to sophomore attacker Brent 
Noseworthy 
in 
the 
second 

quarter against Notre Dame.

“(King) has been a steady 

presence for us when he’s in.” 
Paul said. “He and Kyle Jackson 
have really been the first two elite 
offensive players for us.”

Despite enduring a similar 

shot deficit and lackluster second 
half against Mercer on Thursday, 
three consecutive conversions 
on extra-man opportunity in the 
second quarter boosted Michigan 
to a 11-6 victory. 

Noseworthy earned his fourth 

hat trick of the season, as King, 
sophomore 
midfielder

ourselves

the programs that are usually

better prepared than us. We’re 
getting more confident — that’s 
really the biggest difference.”

Michigan splits series 
with No. 5 Minnesota

With just over three minutes 

left 
in 
the 
third 
period, 

freshman goaltender Hayden 
Lavigne 
skated 
towards 

Michigan’s 
bench. 
Senior 

forward Alex Kile took his 
place, jumping onto the ice and 
heading toward Minnesota’s 
defensive end to give the 
Wolverines a man-advantage.

It was a last-ditch effort for 

the Michigan hockey team, as 
it trailed 3-1 during the final 
stretch of its second game 
against No. 5 Minnesota. But 
despite the last-ditch efforts 
from 
the 
Wolverines, 
they 

wouldn’t 
close 
the 
deficit. 

Instead, the Golden Gophers 
scored an additional empty-net 
goal.

With the final goal, Michigan 

(4-12-2-2 
Big 
Ten, 
11-18-3 

overall) fell to Minnesota on 
Saturday 
in 

the 
second 

game of a home 
series at Yost 
Ice Arena, 4-1. 
The Wolverines 
split the series 
with the Golden 
Gophers (13-5-
0, 22-10-2) after 
recording a win 
Friday, 5-3.

“We 

didn’t figure our game out 
quickly enough,” said senior 
defenseman Nolan De Jong. 
“Yesterday, we definitely didn’t 
like our start but we liked the 
way we came out in the second 
and third. We ended the game 
really well tonight, but it was 
the first 40 minutes that kind 
of bit us at the end of the day. 
(Lavigne) did a great job of 
keeping us in it, keeping it 
within a couple goals, but I 
think we just couldn’t figure 
ourselves out quickly enough.”

The beginning of the first 

period was chopped up into 
penalties, as five were tallied 
within 
a 
13-minute 
span. 

Despite the early back-and-
forth play as a result of power 
plays and penalty kills, neither 
team was able to capitalize on 
an opportunity to put itself on 
the scoreboard.

But with 4:35 remaining in 

the first period, Minnesota 
forward 
Rem 

Pitlick was able 
to do just that 
on a Michigan 
turnover. 
Forward 
Tyler 
Sheehy 

sent the puck 
from 
behind 

Lavigne’s 
left 

to Pitlick, who 
was waiting in 
front of the net 
to finish it off.

Sophomore forward Cooper 

Marody was almost able to 
tie the score when he sent in 
a rebound that bounced off 
Golden 
Gopher 
goaltender 

Eric Schierhorn. But the goal 
was waived off, as Schierhorn 
had been down on the ice, 

and the Wolverines remained 
scoreless 
headed 
into 
the 

second period.

“The mentality was, ‘Hey, 

we need to play better. We’re 
still in this game, it’s a one-goal 
game.’ We’re still in the game 
even though the shots were 
lopsided,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “We knew that 
we could play better than we 
were playing, but you just don’t 
turn a switch on. Our team is 
trying and they’re playing, 
but 
they 
weren’t 
playing 

with enough of an edge, they 
weren’t playing with enough a 
bite and we were chasing them 
around.”

Both teams knocked down 

the number of penalties they 
were taking in the second 
period 
— 
only 
recording 

coincidental 
minors 
for 

roughing with 1:08 left — and 
in their place, three goals were 
scored throughout the frame.

The 
first 

came 11:55 into 
the period when 
Gopher forward 
Tyler 
Sheehy 

beat 
Lavigne 

on a pass from 
forward Justin 
Kloos. 
An 

additional goal 
from 
forward 

Leon 
Bristedt 

three 
minutes 

later pushed the score to 3-0 in 
favor of Minnesota.

The 
Wolverines 
finally 

landed 
themselves 
on 
the 

scoreboard 
when 
junior 

forward Tony Calderone beat 
Schierhorn with the assistance 
of Marody to cut the deficit 
to 3-1 heading into the third 
period. Up until that point, 
Lavigne faced 31 shots, while 
Schierhorn saw just 17.

Almost halfway into the 

third period, after a Minnesota 
power play ended, Marody 
again almost capitalized on a 
chance to decrease the deficit. 
Freshman 
forward 
Nick 

Pastujov had just returned to 
the ice after serving a penalty 
for having too many men on 
the ice, and sent the puck to 
Marody. But Schierhorn was 
there to stuff the shot, and the 
score remained at 3-1.

And despite the Wolverines’ 

last-minute efforts, the only 

other 
goal 

that would be 
scored was an 
empty-netter 
at the hands of 
Sheehy, ending 
Michigan’s 
series 
with 

Minnesota in a 
split with the 
4-1 loss.

“They’re 

one of the most 
skilled teams in 

the country and I don’t know 
if we respected that as much 
as we needed to,” Calderone 
said. “I think we needed to lay 
bodies early and set the tone, 
but I think we were a little 
lackadaisical today off the start 
and they capitalized.”

With Walton’s emergence, Irvin accepts new role 

It has been an up-and-down 

month for Zak Irvin.

The senior wing went through 

a rough stretch for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team at the end 
of January and into February, 
starting with the Wolverines’ 
game at Michigan State on Jan. 29, 
which began a four-game stretch 
where he scored just 13 points on 
4-for-31 shooting. 

Irvin improved at home against 

Wisconsin on Feb. 16, when a 
banked 3-pointer with the shot 
clock expiring seemed to jump 
start his shot, as he put up 18 points 
on 6-of-12 shooting. 

Since 
then, 
it’s 
been 

temperamental 
for 
Irvin, 

culminating in what Michigan 
coach John Beilein called an 
“exceptional” performance Sunday 
night at Nebraska, where he scored 
15 points on 6-of-9 shooting.

“That game against Nebraska, 

(Irvin) was as good as (senior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr.) was,” 
Beilein 
said. 
“Derrick 
was 

sensational, but Zak was really 
good too.”

Michigan, 
though, 
hasn’t 

missed a beat. The Wolverines 
have gone 6-4 since the game in 
East Lansing. It’s a big difference 
from earlier in the season, when 
a poor shooting performance by 
Irvin usually spelled doom for 
Michigan, such as the November 
loss at South Carolina, where Irvin 
scored just five points on 2-for-13 
shooting.

A lot of Michigan’s success 

without a scoring Irvin is due to 
the emergence of his roommate 
and best friend, Walton, whose 
starring role Irvin has enjoyed 
watching.

“Zak really enjoys seeing his 

roommate do so well,” Beilein said.

And with less pressure on 

himself to score, Irvin has excelled 
in other areas.

The senior wing has become 

a mainstay on the defensive end 
of the court, and his help defense 
on some of the Big Ten’s premier 
frontcourt players in Wisconsin 
forward Ethan Happ and Purdue 

forward Caleb Swanigan has 
boosted Michigan to top-25 RPI 
wins down the stretch to solidify 
its NCAA Tournament resume.

“Derrick’s playing really well 

right now,” Irvin said. “But I’m 
still trying to do as much as I can 
with the scoring 
load. I’m trying to 
affect the team in 
other areas.

“I know how 

important 
it 

is to play well 
defensively 
to 

win games and to 
be in games, so I 
really just try to 
be that anchor 
on defense, and I 
know if I do that, everything else 
will come into play.”

It’s an odd transition for Irvin 

to go from a go-to scorer to the role 
he is in now. When Irvin came to 
Michigan four years ago, his role 
was to be a shooter. Now, his job on 
the team has changed to more of a 

secondary scorer and a mainstay 
on the boards and the defensive 
end.

“(Irvin) just turned it over 

and said, ‘I’m going to become a 
defensive player and forget about 
(the slump), and I know that if I put 

less pressure on 
myself to be the 
guy, I could be a 
better performer,” 
Beilein said.

And in turn, as 

Irvin has defined 
his role, so has the 
rest of the team. 
And 
it’s 
made 

for a better team 
overall.

“(Zak’s 

playing) a different role on the 
team, but it’s made our team better 
right now,” Beilein said. “As Zak 
was going through a transition of 
trying to read things better and 
shoot it better, it forces us to go 
in other directions while he gains 
some confidence back, and it’s 

made our team better.”

But through it all — the slump 

and the role change — Irvin’s 
confidence hasn’t wavered.

Over the last seven games of the 

season, Irvin averaged 10 shots per 
game, not a far cry from the 11.75 
shots per game he averaged before 
then.

“He’s got a lot of faith in 

himself,” Beilein said. “He’s really 
got a good personality of letting 
things go.”

Added Walton: “The player and 

person that he is, he wants to be 
great at everything, so when one 
thing isn’t working, he’s worked so 
hard on everything. Overall, I don’t 
think his demeanor has changed. 
He’s still a confident person.”

Now, with Irvin’s collegiate 

career coming to an end, Michigan 
is going to need him to be as 
confident as ever.

Except this time, unlike earlier 

in his career, he will need to be 
confident in other aspects of his 
game besides scoring.

F

or the millionth 
time, he did not 
deliver me.

My 
dad 

is 
a 
second-

generation obstetrician and 
gynecologist, 
meaning 
he 

spends his days delivering 
babies, talking to women 
about 
their 
problems 

(whether 
health-related 
or 

not) and making sure their 
reproductive systems are in 
check. His father, my abuelo, 
did the same until he retired 
just last year.

As I’m sure you can imagine, 

having a father who knows 
more about periods than I 
do has more or less shaped 
the way I grew up. When 
I was little, all that meant 

was snickering alongside my 
siblings when we overheard 
Dad on a work call (“What 
does ‘discharge’ mean?”). In 
middle school, when I got my 
period before my friends, it 
meant that I had more than 
just my mother to support me 
— as awkward as it was to ask 
my dad if he’d seen any pads 
lying around the house.

Now, as a college student, 

the implications of having a 
gynecologist father resonate 
with me more than ever 
before. Through the simple 
act of going to work every 
day, my dad has shown 
me that sexuality is a key 
component of human health, 
one 
that 
deserves 
a 
far 

brighter spotlight than the 

one America has given it.

Last 
October, 
a 
report 

from the Centers for Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention 

showed 
that 
rates 
of 

chlamydia, 
gonorrhea 
and 

syphilis in the U.S. are higher 
than ever before. Meanwhile, 
our 
means 
of 
prevention 

are 
growing 
ever-more 

innovative by the day. What, 
then, is causing the spike in 
STDs?

Nobody talks.
It’s the 21st century, and 

it’s still considered taboo 
to discuss sexual relations 
in any way, shape or form, 
even 
in 
the 
context 
of 

health care. According to 
Planned 
Parenthood, 
half 

of all American teens felt 
uncomfortable 
talking 
to 

their parents about sex in 
2012. Cringey as they may 
be, those conversations could 
mean the difference between 
preventing and contracting 
lifelong health complications.

Not only that, but our 

current educational system 
is not equipped to show 
students why sex must be 
spoken of. Though higher-
income areas may be capable 
of tackling this issue to some 
extent both in and out of the 
classroom, 
communities 
of 

lower socioeconomic status 
may not have the means to 
provide their citizens with 
adequate resources, whether 

educational 
or 
medical. 

Consequently, 
lower-income 

areas 
often 
find 
STDs, 

unplanned pregnancies and 
other dire, yet preventable, 
issues added to their infinite 
list of problems to solve. In 
short, we can’t understand 
what we don’t shamelessly 
discuss.

Then there’s the ongoing 

tension 
surrounding 
the 

crimson 
wave. 
Girls 
still 

get periods, and yet, most 
still can’t openly reach for 
a tampon without feeling 
the eyes of everyone in 
the room boring into their 
uteruses (maybe that’s not 
quite how it happens, but 
it’s still uncomfortable, all 
right?). Menstruation is a 
human function that has 
existed since the beginning 
of time — even longer than 
the 
“National 
Treasure” 

franchise. It is preparation 
for those who intend to 
bring life into the world — a 
reminder of all the wonder 
of which the female body is 
capable. Why is the phrase, 
“She’s 
probably 
on 
her 

period,” an insult used to 
degrade anyone who’s in a 
bad mood? When I’m crying 
over a real, significant issue, 
why is the first response 
of nearly everyone I know 
to ask me if I’m PMSing? 
Why is menstruation the 
longstanding excuse for all of 

women’s weaker moments?

Nobody talks.
I’ve 
grown 
up 
in 
a 

household where the body 
is spoken about openly to 
some degree, whether I 
like it or not. Let me clear 
this up: I don’t talk about 
boys with my dad, but if I 
have a question regarding 
the well-being of my body, 
I ask. Asking your father 
about your vagina is not 
always the most exciting 
thing to do, but I’ve learned 
to speak of these matters 
the way I would a broken 
leg. Health is health, after 
all, no matter the part of 
the body.

Sure, 
it’s 
strange 
to 

think that my dad took 
care of my high school 
science 
teacher, 
or 
that 

he’s probably delivered one 
of you (Beaumont Royal 
Oak, anyone?). But he is 
also the one who showed 
me what to do if I contract 
a 
yeast 
infection, 
who 

encouraged me to discuss 
birth control. I still get 
texts from girlfriends at 
home 
thanking 
me 
for 

his 
secret 
cramp-zapping 

strategies 
(two 
Tylenol 

Extra Strength, one Aleve). 
It’s my dad I have to thank 
for feeling comfortable and 
safe in my own skin.

But 
no, 
he 
won’t 
be 

delivering my children.

L

ike any good story, my column 
starts when a girl walks into a 
bar. However, this one happens 
to be my bar, a hallowed hall 
and point of pride. It’s personal, 
confessing to which drinking 

establishment to which you tether time and 
esteem. It reveals something about who you are, 
or rather, how you want to see yourself.

Stories need settings. We can all agree that 

a lot less would have happened on “Friends” if 
it weren’t for Central Perk. Some of the most 
important scenes of “How I Met Your Mother” 
happened in MacLaren’s Pub. The universe of 
“Cheers” exists almost entirely inside of the 
titular bar. Of all the gin joints in the world, I 
walked into this one. If my senior year of college 
were shot as a sitcom, you’d find me at the Bar 
on Braun Court.

My first sojourn to Bar was a little more than 

a year ago. An older friend brought me, as my 
drinking Obi-Wan Kenobi, and ordered on 
my behalf my first mixed drink. Before then, 
whiskey sours were like life rafts in a sea of 
confusing cocktails and crafty beers. In a post-
Solo cup world, this bar changed my perspective. 
This bar brought me the White Russian, a drink 
to which even today this dude abides.

As Carrie Bradshaw is to the Cosmopolitan, I 

am to the White Russian. The drink, a blend of 
cream and coffee liqueur, arrives in a rounded 

martini glass as a nectar-thick concoction of a 
deep mahogany brown. It’s topped with a foam 
so delicious that after I’ve finished, I scoop it 
out of the glass with my finger. As the menu 
boldly describes, it is the best you’ll ever have.

Needless to say, this isn’t where you’d go to 

catch the end of a Wings game. Bar is situated 
on the second floor of 327 Braun Court, and 
unlike the cavernous expanse of The Last Word, 
Bar is a much smaller and cozier space in a way 
that is familiar, rather than formal. It consists 
of two rooms — one a row of booths and the 
other a series of wooden tables — separated by 
the bar itself, where craft beverages are mixed 
and shaken like volatile chemistry experiments. 
When you’re breezing through the old college 
town, and the kids in the Rick’s line make you 
feel carbon-dated, come drink here.

Rather than having a specific theme, Bar 

seems to have accumulated decorations over 
time, like a dorm room expanding beyond the 
Pulp Fiction poster or a single tapestry. They 
include, but are not limited to, a framed image of 
John F. Kennedy, a portrait of The Last Supper 
and a yawning kitten. Deer heads are mounted in 
the same room whose own accessories fluctuate 
with the seasons. Tonight, the doe is wrapped 
with plenty of scarves, while the buck is rocking 
beads, a beanie and a forgotten umbrella.

My companion is a music buff, and I can’t 

help but appreciate what’s playing more with 

her commentary. A tinkling song comes on 
that sounds like a jazzier version of the “Twin 
Peaks” intro, and I’m told it’s a new song by 
Chicago-based soul singer Jamila Woods. I’m 
also not trendy enough to recognize the latest 
head-bobbing album from A Tribe Called Quest, 
which she points out is an interesting record to 
spin in what looks like Ted Nugent’s yard sale.

There is nothing tying the room together but 

the faint glow of tabletop candles delivered 
with the drink menus and the string lights 
from the patio downstairs. In fact, most of the 
ambiance in the second room is provided by the 
wide window on the right-hand side of the bar 
overlooking the courtyard, where the view of 
Aut Bar’s neon-lit alley transports you straight 
to 1980s New York.

The Bar on Braun Court is my favorite place 

in Ann Arbor. The service is attentive, the mood 
is chill and the drinks are delicious. It’s close to 
my apartment and my heart. It’s where, though 
not everyone knows my name, or is always glad 
I came, they’ve never forgotten my drink order. 
Over a flickering candle and a White Russian, 
I’ve discussed work anxiety, boy troubles and 
personal relationships. It’s where more than a 
dozen great nights have either begun or ended.

Yeah, it’s just a bar. It’s a room where people 

get drunk. It’s dark, it’s expensive and I’ve never 
regretted one second within its walls.

It’s my bar. But it can be yours, too.

Cassandra’s Song

memories from motor city

b y M e r i n M c D i v i t t, Daily Arts Writer

S

pringfield Street, a short stretch of 

asphalt on Detroit’s east side, used to 

have so many elm trees shading the 

road that Detroiters could barely see the sky as 

they drove on their way to the freeway. Passersby 

would stop for gas after work at Cliff’s, or grab a 

snack for the road at the Bamboo Bar, and I imag-

ine they’d stand there for a minute and watch the 

husky flecks of sun come down from the west and 

nearly stop cold over that dense canopy. In the 

summer, when the leaves got thick and bristly, 

the trees gave shade to kids biking and roller-

skating down the pavement. The street sweep-

ers would trim the branches so they stayed neat, 

twined together so it seemed like one long arch: a 

shadowy green tunnel with light at the end.

The trees were the first thing Cassandra 

Compton noticed when her family moved to 

Springfield from the north side.

“I can remember December 1954 like it was 

yesterday,” she said, recalling all the stories she’s 

told me.

To me, she’s always been Dr. Montgomery, 

never Mel or Cassandra or even a Compton: a 

kind recreation director with a Ph.D. in medical 

anthropology. She became the director of Del-

ray Recreation Center on the southwest side of 

Detroit the year after I began working there as a 

high school volunteer. I quickly got to know and 

love Dr. Montgomery as we worked side by side 

over the years. She cut her hair short last year, 

for the first time in a decade, and now it twists 

around her head like a halo. Dr. Montgomery is 

one of the smartest people I know, and one of the 

most caring. Her face is smooth and bright for her 

66 years — wrinkle-free, except for a few smile 

lines around her eyes and mouth, and a line of 

worry stretched thin across her forehead.

While I was volunteering under her, she pep-

pered our conversation with old anecdotes, and 

brought her childhood home back to life.

The city’s present state is all I’ve ever known 

of it, and I love it as it is. In the five years I worked 

at the community center, I met enough wonder-

ful people to pull me back there often, for Christ-

mas parties and baptisms and the occasional 

quinceañera.

But Dr. Montgomery’s love is so much stron-

ger and more beautiful. It’s not easy to love a 

place when you remember the light glinting at 

the western edge of that green tunnel of trees 

above 5572 Springfield St., and she tells me you 

can’t bring yourself to drive by all that emptiness 

where you played, and learned to read and went 

on your first date. You can hold it in your hand 

and squeeze tightly, but it will just fall through 

like dust. I want to understand, at least a little bit, 

what it means to love something like that.

******

Detroit, the birthplace of the automotive 

industry and the heart of the American Arsenal 

of Democracy, hit a golden age coming off the 

second World War. Its population hit its all-time 

peak of 1.85 million in the 1950s, and the Big 

Three automakers — General Motors, Ford and 

Chrysler — fueled a growing middle class. How-

ever, labor disputes and racial tensions between 

white and Black workers — followed by energy 

crises, automation and imports — hurt employ-

ment in the region’s largest industry.

The city would also suffer from severe racial 

tensions that came to a head in the summer of 

1967 race riots, a product of segregation, unem-

ployment and police brutality. It has been 62 

Decembers since Montgomery’s move to the east 

side.

“I am 66 years old,” she said. “Let’s put it that 

way, and you do the math.” 

November 1954 had been cold and clear, sur-

prisingly sunny for a gray Detroit winter. But 

December made up for it with piles of thick wet 

snow, and while it must have turned instantly to 

lead-laced gasoline slush on the gray street below, 

up high in the elm trees it would’ve made a tun-

nel all the same, lacier and more delicate than the 

jungly summer canopy. On the days that hovered 

just above freezing, maybe it looked like a watery 

spider’s web, one that would splatter you with 

chilly droplets when you walked underneath.

That was their new street, and even with the 

novelty of the tree tunnel, Cassandra and her 

older sister, Tywania, were not thrilled when 

Jimmy Compton Sr. packed up the family that 

December and moved across town to Springfield 

Street. Their dad worked for the Detroit Post 

Office, and he decided it was time for a differ-

ent zip code. To make things even more difficult, 

they were the first Black family to move onto the 

street.

They missed their old brownstone, with bed-

rooms all upstairs; many years later they would 

recognize an almost identical home in the 

Huxtable’s apartment in “The Cosby Show,” and 

remember it fondly. They got used to their new 

house on Springfield Street, though, and the way 

she talks about her former neighborhood often 

makes me wish I had grown up there.

Cassandra was 4 then, but already everybody 

called her Mel. Her middle name is Melody, and 

the nickname stuck. She used to sing with her 

brothers and sisters while her mother played the 

piano.

“It rained 40 days, and it rained 40 nights; 

there wasn’t no land nowhere in sight. God took 

a raven to bring the news, hoisted his wings and 

away he flew. To the East! To the West!”

Mel’s sister would stand behind her and har-

monize, “Didn’t it fall, my Lord, didn’t it rain!”

Mel still sings, in church concerts and on her 

own, and sometimes to me. Her rich voice fills 

the room, even if we are in the high-ceilinged 

gym of the community center. She hums melo-

dies that have stuck in her mind long after her 

nickname slid off, songs that sweep me up in her 

nostalgia for a different time. 

“It seemed like everything we wanted was 

close by, you know?” Mel said, her voice bright 

when describing her childhood home. “Big stores 

— there were still mom and pop stores. We could 

walk within a mile radius — I could go roller-

skating; to a restaurant; I could do Christmas 

shopping; I could get donuts from the bakery; I 

could go to the movies; I could go swimming.” 

These are things she can’t do now because many 

of these businesses are now shuttered and the old 

residents now departed.

Dr. Montgomery talks about this time and 

place with such longing. The snow heaps up 

outside the coffee shop and I can close my eyes 

and see Springfield in summer: Head east out 

the front porch, turn right on Shoemaker Street 

and pass Betty’s Sweet Shop, with model cars (all 

American, of course) and candy and a chrome-

plated soda fountain just like in the movies. 

Round the corner again at Lemay, and there’s 

Rinaldi’s Supermarket. Frank’s was across the 

street, and a restaurant with jukeboxes and cheap 

hamburgers, and those plush stools that kids can 

swirl around on until they start to feel sick.

Turn back for home and there on the corner 

of Shoemaker and Springfield was a big empty 

lot with some old billboards. “It was kind of hilly, 

and you’d play in the ice and the snow, or in the 

summer we went and would catch grasshop-

pers — you can’t get me to go in tall grass now,” 

Dr. Montgomery remembered with a chuckle “I 

don’t know how I did it back then. I was a kid. I 

was a tomboy.”

*****

Dr. Montgomery isn’t the only one grasping 

at these old memories. So many of the people 

who live or work in Detroit today, and those who 

were raised in the city but moved away — Dr. 

Montgomery now lives mere miles from me in 

Washtenaw County — are nostalgically drawn 

to the glimmer of the old city, the splendor of 

its ballrooms and mansions and movie palaces. 

Publishers can’t print enough books with titles 

such as: “Detroit: An American Autopsy,” “Hid-

den History of Detroit,” “Once in a Great City,” 

“Detroit City is the Place to Be,” and “Where Did 

Our Love Go?” There are more than 1,000 images 

tagged “Detroit Nostalgia” on Pinterest, entire 

Tumblr blogs and coffee table books and art-

ists’ careers dedicated to frayed black-and-white 

photographs. In them, older suburbanites lament 

their lost childhood homes and recite the litany 

of forgotten city landmarks like well-worn rosary 

beads, like saying them over and again will bring 

them back to life: Hudson’s Department Store, 

the streetcar, Vernor’s Soda Fountain.

Even Berry Gordy, Motor City’s prodigal son, 

returned to cash in on this thirst for nostalgia. 

Two years ago, I took the University of Michigan 

shuttle to see “Motown: The Musical,” Gordy’s 

version of the record label’s rise, from Hitsville, 

U.S.A. to Hollywood. This was the nostalgic nar-

rative, Motown the company as gentle and pater-

nal, Motown the city as idyllic until the riots hit. 

I lapped it up. Gordy crammed the musical with 

every classic hit he still held the rights to, and, 

sitting there in the Fisher Theatre, surrounded 

by older ladies jamming to every song like it was 

1965, I beamed for three hours straight.

It was nothing, though, compared to what the 

Comptons saw at the Motown Revues. Forget 

plain old nostalgia. If I too had been able to see 

The Jackson 5 and The Temptations in the same 

night — as Mel was able to multiple times while 

growing up — I’d be clawing at the door of the 

Fox Theatre like it was a time machine, begging 

to go back. In the 1960s, Motown would toss all 

its artists into one big show around Christmas-

time. They would perform maybe four shows 

a day, one after the other, with a short break in 

between. Mel would stay for all of them.

“We got there in the morning, and they didn’t 

clear out the Fox and say, ‘Hey, you paid for this 

time, for another group.’ You could stay. (Their 

wait brought them) Gladys Knight and the Pips, 

Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Tammi,” Mel 

said, drawing out their names long and slow. 

“Tammi Terrell was beautiful. Those big pretty 

eyes, and the way she wore her bangs — they kind 

of had a little peak right there. Oh, she was beau-

tiful.” 

Listening to my recording of our conversation, 

scratchy voices heard above the saxophone music 

of the coffee shop, something in Dr. Montgom-

ery’s tone struck me. I rewound a few seconds, 

“Oh, she was beautiful.”

*****

Dr. Montgomery’s stories are all tinged with 

this soft quality of light, these infectious melo-

dies that make me want to believe, to go back.

“Sometimes when I’m talking to you, I hear 

music,” she tells me. “I’d carry a transistor radio 

about as big as a box of cracker jacks. … I’m walk-

ing home listening to Dee Clark singing ‘Rain-

drops.’ ”

That glossy sheen never really wears off Dr. 

Montgomery’s memories of this time.

There are nicks in the varnish, though, and 

they get bigger as we talk, as each year of Mel’s 

childhood passes by with a quick step, as the 

grown-up world creeps in alongside the slow and 

tedious decline of her neighborhood. Growing up 

in the first Black family on a Detroit street was 

not all jukeboxes and soda fountains.

“It was challenging,” she said. “Our neighbors 

on either side of us were welcoming, but there 

were neighbors farther down that weren’t so wel-

coming, and did some things that, you know … 

weren’t neighborly.”

The kids made up other nicknames, too, these 

ones not particularly fond or funny.

“There was another lady, we called her ‘Miss 

Hellcat-Raiser,’ because she didn’t like Blacks,” 

Mel remembered. “Neither did her son. I don’t 

know where we got that name from.”

Other neighbors ignored Mel, pretending she 

didn’t exist and refusing to move their spurting 

hose from the sidewalk to let her pass by on bicy-

cles and roller skates. The shade of the canopy 

overhead could protect the Compton kids from 

the harsh sunlight, but there was little protection 

against a petty, agitated white neighborhood — a 

neighborhood whose local high school yearbook 

was titled “The Aryan” until a year or two before 

Mel enrolled there.

Then there was a neighbor who never had a 

nickname.

“There was this one gentleman that would not 

want to walk on the same side of the street with 

us,” Mel said. “And if we did get too close with 

him, he’d take the collar of his coat and put it up 

to his face, and he’d turn to the side and spit on 

the ground.”

And there were faceless neighbors too. Ones 

who came in the night and broke all their garage 

windows.

As bad as things could get on Springfield 

Street, they were nothing compared to the 

Compton’s original home: Alabama. Mel was 

born in Birmingham, and her grandparents lived 

in an old company town built by the steel indus-

try. Though she grew up in Detroit, the Comp-

tons would visit Alabama when they could to 

catch up with family. She remembers the view 

out the window seat of the Greyhound bus as it 

approached the city during the trips throughout 

her childhood — first, flat farmland, then, heavy 

industry on the outskirts and the hulking, slight-

ly goofy silhouette of the huge steel Vulcan statue 

that welcomed them to Birmingham, glowing 

dark red while the sun set.

It wasn’t much of a welcome. Grandma Lar-

cena and Grandpa Mose kept the Compton kids 

occupied, but as Mel entered her teens, she start-

ed to notice things. She would sit on the stoop in 

her red majorette boots, which got so tattered by 

her marching that the heels wore off. Just down 

the way was a bar. 

“To my right when I looked over my shoulder 

was ‘Black Only,’ and I looked over my shoulder 

to the left and it was ‘White Only,’ ” Mel said, 

referring to the Jim Crow-imposed signs on pub-

lic spaces in the South. She was a northern kid 

unfamiliar with this sort of legally codified dis-

crimination, so she stared too long and too hard. 

“I was looking over there and they stared at me, 

like ‘What are you doing?’ ” she remembered. 

“And they were hostile.”

By the late 1950s and early ’60s, the memory 

fades out.

“It seems like everything after that is blank,” 

Dr. Montgomery said. “I don’t know if we took the 

bus, or were they boycotting at the time? I don’t 

remember, I don’t remember. I just know when 

I saw that look on their faces, I can’t remember 

anything after that.”

Soon after, the trips faded too. The Compton’s 

last visit down to Birmingham was in 1959. After 

that, some of the buses that went down stopped 

coming back up. The Freedom Riders took the 

Greyhound too, from Detroit and other cities in 

the North. Mr. Compton didn’t want his children 

sitting next to these well-meaning kids who had 

no idea what they were getting themselves into.

“My dad was fearful of letting us,” Dr. Mont-

gomery said. “It was bittersweet. I felt a little 

resentful that year after year we couldn’t visit 

because of the civil unrest.”

One of these buses sits in the Birmingham Civil 

Rights Institute now — its hull, that is, charred 

and bare. Sometimes, people would set fire to 

the Greyhounds as they carried the Freedom 

Riders, idealistic students on a mission to regis-

ter Black southerners to vote. Her father didn’t 

want his children coming back up north the way 

14-year-old Emmett Till did — in an open casket. 

Mel’s mother sang for the True Rock Missionary 

Baptist Church on the east side; later, the family 

switched to the Lemay Avenue Baptist Church. 

Plunk these churches down in Birmingham, and 

Mel might’ve ended up like Denise McNair. Or 

Carole Robertson, Addie Mae Collins or Cynthia 

Wesley. That Birmingham church bombing, the 

notorious one in 1963, was the third such incident 

in 11 days in the city.

*****

There is a dark side to our nostalgia — the 

memories that are hazy and gray, the things that 

Mel didn’t understand well at the time and have 

since faded, fast. Yearning for the past also means 

a shared agreement that we will cast out the rec-

ollections that don’t fit. Or perhaps agree that the 

present day is not better, but worse. That what lay 

at the end of the tunnel was not salvation.

The glumness of these memories casts a pall 

over the warm glow of Springfield Street. Still, 

Dr. Montgomery and I sail past them, perhaps 

too easily. Recollections are twisted like bal-

loon animals into what we wish to see in them; 

words, those nimble acrobats, contort themselves 

around tricky subjects.

Consider a memory Dr. Montgomery shared a 

little earlier: the thinly veiled racial animus she 

received from some of her more distant white 

neighbors. Dr. Montgomery paused for a second, 

and then she wasn’t Dr. Montgomery anymore. 

She was Mel. The gleam of Springfield Street, 

of that shining tunnel of tree canopies, would 

always win out over the foggy gloom of the bad 

days.

“But the trees,” Mel pivoted. “The street 

sweepers would come, they’d trim the trees. I 

mean, it was just this beautiful archway that it 

looked like.”

*****

A Methodist pastor, Woody White, had moved 

across from the Comptons on Springfield Street 

and took them to church on East Grand Boule-

vard every Sunday. He encouraged the kids to do 

service, and Mel started getting involved in the 

church group.

“That was the most impactful time of my life 

— in the Methodist Youth Fellowship,” Mel said. 

“(Reverend White is) a staunch, staunch advo-

cate, to this day, for civil rights.”

On June 23, 1963, he took the Compton kids 

to a civil rights march at Cobo Hall down by the 

river. Jimmy Sr. was across town representing his 

union in the march.

“I have a picture of my dad holding a picket 

sign that reads: ‘President Lincoln freed the 

slaves, but did nothing for the Negroes. Free us!’ 

” Mel remembered. “And for a long time, I didn’t 

know what that meant.”

This was no ordinary event. At the time, just 

a few months before the March on Washington, 

it was the biggest civil rights demonstration in 

American history. It drew a crowd of 125,000 

people. Mel wore her best dress, and craned her 

neck to see, and Martin Luther King Jr. walked 

up to the podium in Detroit. Organizers called 

this the Walk to Freedom; later, King would call 

it “one of the most wonderful things that has hap-

pened in America.”

And King said this:

“I have a dream this afternoon that one day, 

one day little white children and little Negro chil-

dren will be able to join hands as brothers and sis-

ters. … And with this faith I will go out and carve 

a tunnel of hope through the mountain of despair. 

With this faith, I will go out with you and trans-

form dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows.”

Later that summer, King would deliver an 

abridged version of this speech on the steps of 

the Lincoln Memorial, overlooking more than 

200,000 people on the National Mall. This, of 

course, would eclipse the Detroit march until 

it faded into nothing more than a footnote, an 

unlikely story told by wet-eyed grandparents. 

That September in Detroit, as schoolchildren 

prepared to return to class, a bomb detonated 

by members of the Ku Klux Klan would kill 

four little girls, blind an 11-year-old in her right 

eye, and injure 20 others. At the twilight of that 

decade, King was shot, riots racked Mack Avenue 

and Woodward as Mel took the bus home from 

a concert downtown, a war began in Vietnam 

and classmates lost their lives, those hostile and 

frightened white neighbors moved away and 

didn’t come back. The decades passed, and Mel 

became Dr. Montgomery and moved away. The 

house on Springfield Street was torn down.

I want so badly to believe in just the happy 

stories — the snow globe city in Mel’s memories. 

I think that’s what Dr. Montgomery wants, too. 

She spins her stories around me faster and faster, 

it dizzies me and I imagine we pick up the globe 

and shake so hard. And the snow turns to leaded 

slush and ashes. And we are back in the desert, 

wandering; wandering.

This is all I can give you; it’s all I have. Hold 

Springfield Street 1963 in your hand and hope it 

doesn’t slip through like dust. And there is no five 

years later. No slumped, bloodied reverend, no 

sun-bleached balcony in Tennessee. No house-

burning, fear-raising riots; no broken windows; 

and no concerts cut short by nearby looting. No 

for-sale signs or wood-panelled station wag-

ons speeding to the east, to the west. No Devil’s 

Night, no flames.

There is none of this.

Instead, Berry Gordy gets King to record some 

speeches at the label before the big day. He nearly 

jumps out of his socks when the good reverend 

instructs Gordy to donate all royalties to the 

Southern Christian Leadership Conference. King 

doesn’t want a cent. Gordy never forgets.

Instead, Jimmy Compton Sr. gets up early 

like usual and marches with the postal workers’ 

union. In a few years, Jimmy will be president of 

the union, bringing him plenty of trouble and a 

reputation as a hell-raiser. He will always stand 

for what is right, and raise the Compton kids to 

do the same. Jimmy steps down the asphalt in his 

old work boots and holds his sign aloft, gingerly, 

like it doesn’t weigh more than an ounce.

And Mel wears her Sunday best, and strains 

to hear the reverend in the echoey hall, and what 

she does hear, she likes. Afterward they ride 

back home with Woody and Kim White, and pass 

under the tunnel of elms, leaves thick and check-

ered with sunlight in the late afternoon. And 

maybe on the other side, there is salvation.

COURTESY OF DR. CASSANDRA MONTGOMERY


I

’m sitting in my dorm room on a 

Monday night. A red milk crate 

next to my dresser contains some 

of my favorite vinyl albums I have 

ever bought myself, or found in my 

dad’s record collection. Flipping past albums 

by David Bowie, The Who and even Kendrick 

Lamar, my fingers linger on the ragged edge 

of The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan. I remember 

buying it in a record shop in Clawson, Mich. 

It still feels like it did when I bought it: in 

shitty condition, but like someone else had 

cherished it as much as I do now. I slide the 

album out of its cover and watch the needle 

slowly descend onto the outer rim.

As the first note resonates through the 

speakers, memories of yesteryear begin to 

manifest. My eyes slowly close as I lean back 

on my carpet, ready to remember.

***

“Blowin’ in the Wind”

I saw myself sitting at some random 

open mike in some random café in some 

random city in metro Detroit. The espresso 

machines, acting as percussion, let off steam 

while songwriters croon their hearts out to 

a crowd of 10 or 20. I said I hadn’t planned 

on performing (even though everyone saw 

my guitar case next to my seat). The signup 

sheet, which was once filled to the brim with 

performers, was empty. The MC pointed at 

my case and called my name. My dad probably 

set her up to it. Instinctively, I grabbed my 

songbook and flipped to the track playing 

in my ears right now. I must’ve been 11 or 12 

years old then. 

Sliding my guitar strap over my neck 

and pretending like I knew how to tune by 

ear, my prepubescent voice squeaked in the 

microphone. It wasn’t my first open mike and 

it wouldn’t be my last, but for some reason this 

one seemed important.

“I dedicate this one to my dad,” I began.

***

“Girl from the North Country”

Despite 
having 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 

Dylan’s lyrics about a former lover, this song 

transported me to the summer before freshman 

year of college. I had a ton of friends who went 

to the local Catholic high school. They’re all still 

confused as to why I know them. Nonetheless, 

we spent the entire summer together.

In my friend Lucy’s backyard, we would 

grab blankets, dust off cheap plastic chairs and 

build the biggest bonfire we could. Sweatshirts 

were a must given the cool summer breeze. We 

would practice handstands and fall on faces or 

on our backs if we were lucky.

The orange glow of the fire reflected in my 

friend Lily’s eyes next to me. We all knew we 

would be going to different corners of the state, 

country and even the globe in the upcoming 

years. We decided to save the tears for later.

Instead, we opted for handstands.

***

“Masters of War”

In my ears, Dylan strikes a menacing chord 

lamenting about the men behind the wars 

that “build the big guns.” It reminds me of 

the first protest I saw during a vacation in 

Chicago the summer of 2014.

Walking through the city with my friend 

Sean, my mom and her boyfriend at the 

time, I heard a faint crowd in the distance. 

Two streets over on Michigan Avenue, I 

saw thousands of men, women and children 

holding signs rallying in support of the state 

of Palestine. I stood in silence for a few 

minutes, mentally wishing them the best of 

luck. It was all I could do in the moment.

***

“Down the Highway”

Every two or three weeks when I was 

little, my parents and I would make the two-

and-a-half-hour drive to Kalamazoo. This 

was before their divorce. Grandparents and 

cousins from both sides of the family lived 

about 10 miles from one another around 

the city. Sometimes, I would fall asleep on 

the ride because my mom always said they 

would “take the shortcut” so we would get to 

Humma’s quicker. The logistics behind this 

magical secret route they took never crossed 

my mind.

I would stare out the window and watch 

the long stretches of pavement in front of us. 

The trees waved at me as they shook from the 

breeze. Large highway signs were just colors 

to me. I felt every bump of the road shake 

my seat. As I slowly got tired of listening to 

the highway rumble underneath our car, I 

decided to let my parents “take the shortcut.”

***

“Bob Dylan’s Blues”

Bob Dylan’s ramblings and harmonica 

permeate my train of thought. I can almost 

feel the cold metal of my old harmonica I had 

when I was 12. It was in the key of D.

It was opening day for the Tigers. Instead 

of going to the game, my dad and I went to 

his friend’s tailgate around the corner from 

Comerica Park. Radios blared live coverage of 

the season opener all across the parking lot. 

I had an orange Tigers cap on the ground, my 

harmonica in my hand and a duct tape wallet 

that longed for a couple of bucks. Playing 

the only song I knew, “Love Me Do” by The 

Beatles, intoxicated baseball fans stumbled 

past my section of the sidewalk. I watched 

them saunter down the street, laughing and 

resting on each other for support. I doubt it 

was my phenomenal harmonica skills that 

convinced the Detroit pub patrons to toss 

a couple bucks in my hat. My wallet was 

packed to the brim with singles as the sun set 

on a beautiful day of baseball.

***

“A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall”

Immediately, this song forces me back to 

the day of my great-grandma Nanny’s funeral. 

I know I was 11 because we have her memorial 

card on my fridge back home.

She had always been my favorite relative 

to visit. Not just because she would let my 

cousin Evan and I eat chocolate donut holes 

for breakfast, but because she didn’t care what 

other people thought. It hurt for months when 

she passed. The concept of “getting old” never 

resonated with me until that moment. Then I 

understood all too well.

At the funeral, I had to step outside with 

my dad to get away from the stuffy visitation. I 

didn’t like my tears landing on the lapel of my 

tiny suit. In the sky, I saw dark and menacing 

clouds in the distance, heading straight for 

the funeral home. I knew Dylan understood 

my pain through his lyrics. “A hard rain’s 

gonna fall,” pain exists, and you can’t avoid 

it. Like the clouds in the sky, they were going 

to come no matter how much I didn’t want 

them to. I just wished they wouldn’t have 

come that day. I wanted see the blue sky and 

remember how sunny days would reflect on 

the pond in Nanny’s backyard. I wanted to 

remember better days. But I couldn’t.

***

Silence.

Side one comes to an end. My eyes open 

but I can feel my tear ducts welling up. I 

rub my face and sit for a moment in stunned 

reflection. I lift the needle, switch off the 

turntable, flip to side two, and brace for 

another track.

***

“Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right”

Just as Dylan begins his fingerpicking, I 

realize how the music resolves itself.

Pain in life brings reassurance and creates 

the memories I recalled tonight. Of course 

rain falls, but rain clears and the remnants 

of the showers create puddles for children 

to play in the next day. As Dylan reflects on 

another lost love, I reflect on the role Nanny 

played in my life before and after her death. 

She’ll be with me. Always. “Fare thee well.”

***

We etch our memories into the blank 

plastic canvas of our minds. Happy, sad or 

anything in between, we carve them all. We 

can’t choose when we remember what we 

do, but that’s the beauty of music. Songs are 

arranged in their order to guide us through 

the past. The record spins until side one’s 

time has elapsed, and this is where the 

true magic of an album comes to life. We 

trust music to guide us through in the best 

direction it can — toward the center of the 

album and beyond.

Personal Statement: 

A Second Chance to Write my Story

A

s I put my bag of pretzels down 
on the counter with the rest of my 
mom’s groceries, I see the cashier 
do a double-take. Catching me 

staring, she attempts to quickly hide her knee-
jerk reaction to the realization that the woman 
she is ringing up is my mom, but not before I 
can see the surprise and confusion in her face. 
It was as though she needed a moment to pro-
cess that I, the Asian girl with the dark-brown 
hair, am somehow related to the tall, curly-
haired blonde woman. The blue-eyed, light-
skinned woman was responsible for funding 
my unhealthy obsession with pretzels.

At first, I was annoyed — another cashier 

mistook me for the daughter of the Asian lady 
behind us in the checkout line. But unlike a 
younger version of myself — who would have 
let out a loud sigh, rolled my eyes or furrowed 
my brow — I quietly let the cashier ring us up, 
pack our groceries and place them into our car. 
I didn’t let show how much it got to me. I even 
smiled and said, “You too” when she told us to 
have a good day. After all, how could she have 
known? 

Growing up, when this used to happen, I 

would become immediately and visibly upset 
because I would feel as though a part of my 
identity was taken from me. I would feel oth-
ered, as though I was being singled out as the 
strange adopted girl in the family. But how 
could they have known?

This is what I’ve begun to say to myself every 

time something like this happens. Every time 
I’m mistaken for the daughter of the Asian 
woman behind me in the supermarket, or in my 
own home when guests who’ve never met me 
think I’m hired catering staff — because who 
would’ve thought that I was the daughter of a 
white Italian dude from Pennsylvania? Every 
time I venture to the suburbs of Reading, Penn., 
no one knew I was my cousin’s cousin, or my 
aunt’s niece, I would smile and force that awk-
ward introduction. Every time someone doesn’t 
believe that I’m Jewish, I patiently explain that 
I was adopted and my mom is Jewish. How 

could they have known?

But as a child, I wasn’t capable of thinking 

this through in this way, which undermined 
any attempt at reconciling my Chinese heritage 
with my identity as a little girl adopted into a 
white Jewish and Catholic family. According 
to the parent support groups my mom attended 
and the literature she read, parents of adopt-
ed children should do their best to connect 
their children to their native culture. She was 
encouraged to celebrate the Chinese holidays 
and enroll me in classes in the language of my 
home country. And she did just that.

Chinese New Year’s became a big to-do and 

I was swiftly enrolled in Mandarin classes. For 
several years, I attended these classes every 
Saturday. At the end of each year, we had a big 
show where we performed all the songs we’d 
learned. Truthfully, I hated every minute of it. 
So one year, I gave my mom the death-stare of 
all death-stares right in the middle of one of the 
performances, and that was that for the classes. 
After years of wondering why I was so quick 
to reject the Mandarin lessons, I realized it 
was because they highlighted the differences 
between my family and me. Because I was 
enrolled in Mandarin classes, I felt separated 
from my family. The only native culture I had 
ever known was that of my adoptive family, so 
why was I learning a language that no one else 
in my family was?

I would look around our Shabbat dinner 

table or the annual Passover Seder at my aunt 
and uncle’s house, and I would see my family, 
celebrating our Jewish lineage. So why was I 
any different? There was no one in my family 
who spoke Chinese or even celebrated Chinese 
New Year until I entered their lives. I’d grown 
up around Hannukah parties and Bar Mitz-
vahs,’ so why was I expected to take on an iden-
tity that felt entirely foreign to me? As a young 
adult reflecting on my childhood, I know my 
parents only had my best interests at heart, but 
I couldn’t see it then.

For much of my childhood, I would sit on my 

bed night after night, crying to my mom, asking 

her why my bio-
logical 
family 

didn’t want me, 
why they didn’t 
care 
about 

me. My mom 
would sit there, 
patiently trying 
to explain that 
it was for the 
best. My family, 
whoever 
they 

are, 
wanted 

to give me the 
chance at a bet-
ter life. Even 

though I didn’t believe my mom, and I couldn’t 
understand her at the time, it was true.

In a crisis of overpopulation, China imple-

mented a one-child policy, and if you were found 
to have had more than one child, you would be 
forced to pay fees that were often many times 
greater than Chinese families’ average house-
hold incomes, or face harsh consequences. My 
birth mother, my mom explained to me, left me 
in front of a police station — one of the safest 
locations for me to lay snuggled in a blanket to 
be taken to an orphanage. (My birth mother, my 
mom always told me, took a big risk by going to 
a police station and leaving me there in broad 
daylight.)

Even so, up until about high school, I carried 

a feeling with me that my birth family didn’t 
want me. When I was old enough to use Google, 
I started looking up China’s one-child policy. 
Many of the articles I found talked about how 
many families in China who had a boy and a 
girl kept the boy and gave the girl up for adop-
tion. Often, families believed that the boy was 
better equipped to help in the fields and around 
the home. This only made me more upset, more 
anxious and more frustrated that my family 
had probably chosen an older brother over me. I 
was the unwanted daughter.

Starting at a young age, I began to chan-

nel this frustration and anxiety into storytell-
ing. I wrote stories about princesses and girls 
obsessed with horses, and my favorite topic: 
mysteries. But when I crafted my own story, 
that took a different tone. I wrote my story as 
one of an outsider. I had the power to write my 
own story, and for nearly two decades of my life, 
I used it to cast doubts about my self-worth. I 
chose to paint adoption as a stigmatizing iden-
tity, as something that made me different, odd 
and weird.

And for so many years, I had let artificial 

markers — confused cashiers, inquisitive looks, 

family photos — undermine my confidence. As 
a young kid, insecure about my looks and try-
ing desperately to fitting in, my physical dif-
ferences from my parents made me feel even 
worse about myself. Growing up, I shared my 
classroom tables, spotlights on stage and snacks 
at school with kids who all looked like their par-
ents, siblings and grandparents. They all knew 
the hospital they were born in and the time of 
their birth down to the second. And as kid, I 
thought that because I lacked all these things, 
and because my genes made me appear differ-
ent from my parents, others perceived me as the 
weird adopted girl, dropped into a community 
she wouldn’t otherwise be a part of. A commu-
nity she doesn’t belong in.

And now, I have decided to give myself a 

chance to rewrite my story. My adoption is 
part of my identity, and it doesn’t mean I’m an 
awkward outsider, it doesn’t mean I’m any less 
lovable, any less capable of being everything 
I want to be. As I have grown older and more 
introspective, I have realized that what makes 
a family isn’t its physical attributes. Biological 
relations don’t mean much without an emotion-
al connection. People who know me and know 
I was adopted never treated me differently. My 
family loves me just the same as they would a 
biological child. It was I who stigmatized my 
identity for all those years. The feeling that my 
adoption made me the odd one out came solely 
from within myself. I have the power to define 
what my adoption means.

A week ago, I was shopping with my mom in 

a shoe store when a sales clerk came up to me 
and asked me if I needed any help, unaware I 
was browsing with my mom, who was already 
being helped. And while incidents such as these 
will always frustrate me, they will no longer 
make me think I am any less a part of my family.

The street sign at the corner of Bourbon and Orleans.
Uncaught beads and other trash lies on the side of the 

street in a puddle of liquids.

Walking down Bourbon Street in the heart of the 

French Quarter of New Orleans during Mardi Gras is 
an experience like no other. Mardi Gras, also known as 
Carnival, originated in Rome as a celebration of spring 
and fertility. Lit by a glow of neon, Bourbon becomes the 
heart of the week long celebration. Here are my photos 

from just one walk down the famous street.

One of the many neon signs on the street reads “Restaurant.”
The sign of the Gateway Lounge hangs over one of the few empty balconies on Bourbon.

A neon sign for “The Swamp” bar creates a green haze over this part of the street.
People on balconies throw beads down to the crowds walking by in return for, well, 

favors.

The collection of beads I had built up over the weekend sits on my bed as I get ready to leave for the night.
