Speakers discuss 
solutions to racial 
inequalities in the 

industry

By BRANDON-SUMMERS 

MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

A 
coalition 
of 
Univer-

sity organizations examined 
inequalities in the food indus-
try during a food justice panel 
Tuesday night.

The discussion, which served 

as a part of the University’s 
Martin Luther King Jr. sympo-
sium, featured remarks from 
representatives with various 
campus organizations on cur-
rent racial injustices within 
the food industry, as well as a 
brainstorm on innovative ways 
to solve them.

The discussion was hosted by 

several organizations, including 
the Food Access in Michigan 
Project, the Residential Col-

lege and the Michigan Commu-
nity Scholars Program. Student 
Food Co., a group that aims to 
provide students with afford-
able produce, both helped orga-
nize the discussion and offered 
free produce to audience mem-
bers.

The discussion featured sev-

eral speakers who represent 
leaders and members of food-
themed organizations within 
the Ann Arbor and greater 
Detroit areas.

During the event, panelist 

Shane Bernardo, a representa-
tive from the Earthworks Urban 
Farm in Detroit, told attendees 
that historical, institutional-
ized racism is the main reason 
for the racial inequities within 
the food industry.

According to Bernardo, poli-

cies like redlining — a practice 
used by some banks to deny 
credit for individuals living in 
urban areas — have created cur-
rent inequities in the food sup-
ply by dictating who could get 
credit based on where they live 

Community members 

share stories 

through spoken word 

performances

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

The Lydia Mendelssohn The-

ater was filled to capacity for the 
fifth annual Body Monologues 

Tuesday night, featuring spoken 
word narratives from 12 perform-
ers. Inspired by the Vagina Mono-
logues, the event featured stories 
by students about their sexuality 
and body image.

The participants varied in age, 

gender identity, ethnicities and 
race, covering topics including 
lymphedema — a disease that 
causes blockage in the lymphatic 
system — and gender identity.

LSA senior Brittney Williams 

shared her experiences with 

online dating and how she was 
often exploited for her body. She 
received requests from men who 
would seek women fitting her 
height and build, she said, which 
made her feel uncomfortable.

“I think that it’s a story that’s 

not really shared as often, at least 
where fat bodies are concerned,” 
Williams said. “There’s this idea 
that we don’t get a lot of attention. 
So, I wanted to talk specifically 
about receiving that attention and 
how it can be fetishized and how 

that can get really frustrating at 
times.”

Williams said she decided to 

take a humorous route with her 
narrative to engage the audience 
with the familiar experience of 
online dating, even if they don’t 
relate to all the aspects of her 
story. She said her journey was 
reflective of other college stu-
dents’ in experimenting with dat-
ing apps such as Tinder, a site that 
touts more than 9 billion matches

Officials say the 

city is shifting relief 

efforts to tackle 
health concerns 

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Multiple individuals within 

state government, local govern-
ment and the Flint community 
are leading initiatives to remedy 
the ongoing water crisis — and 
respond to the storm of media 
attention — the city faces.

The crisis began in April 2014 

after a water supply switch from 
Detroit city water to Flint River 
water. In the weeks and months 
following the switch, residents 
began reporting adverse health 
effects including hair loss and 
rotting teeth. Both Gov. Rick 
Snyder (R) and President Barack 
Obama have declared states of 
emergencies for the city.

The long-term health effects, 

especially on young children, 
are one of the largest concerns 
for the citizens of Flint. Sharon 
Swindell, assistant professor of 
pediatrics at the University, said 
the primary concern for young 
children is that lead poisoning 
will cause developmental issues, 
which can lead to poor academic 
outcomes. 

“There is no safe level of lead 

in a person’s body,” she said. 
“Children, who have a lot of 
brain growth and development 
in the first six years, are vulner-
able to cognitive and develop-
mental effects. The things we 
worry about long term include 
decreasing IQ, poor academic 
achievement and problems with 
attention.”

In Flint itself and in the state 

legislature, local leaders have 
taken multiple steps to resolve 
the crisis. Earlier this month, 
Flint Mayor Karen Weaver met 
with Obama and White House 
advisers to discuss how to best 
handle the situation.

Protesters, 
supporters 

assembled outside 

rally site 

By SAM GRINGLAS

MUSCATINE, Iowa — The 

first thing you notice is the line. 
On Sunday, it stretched from the 
front doors of Muscatine High 
School down a sidewalk that 

hugged the building’s front side. 
Like a lot of people who attend 
campaign rallies, many of the 
people in line arrived here clad 
in logoed shirts and hats. Some 
held signs. They clutched paper 
tickets printed on white com-
puter paper and moved forward 
as the Secret Service funneled 
them through a bank of metal 
detectors set up in the lobby. For 
a campaign rally, this was all 
pretty normal. But only once you 
look past the line, and absorb the 
full spectacle that surrounds it, 
do you begin to comprehend all 

that is a rally for GOP presiden-
tial candidate Donald J. Trump.

Alongside 
the 
line 
Sun-

day, vendors hawked buttons, 
T-shirts and Trump dolls. On a 
table with “Make America Great 
Again” hats for sale, a water-
color drawing of Trump rested 
next to a poster depicting Adolf 
Hitler holding a health care bill 
and saying, “Obama, you’ve gone 
too far.” In between the two, 
a foam finger touting the Sec-
ond Amendment has a thumb 
drawn to look like a semi-auto-

Six University faculty mem-

bers received Faculty Seed 
Grants from the Institute 
for Research on Women and 
Gender this month for their 
research projects focused on 
women, gender and sexuality. 
The grants ranged from $500 
to $10,000.

The Faculty Seed Grant 

program was established by 
IRWG in 1996 to support both 
disciplinary and interdisci-
plinary projects relating to 
women, gender and sexual-
ity, according to the institute’s 
website.

This 
year’s 
recipients 

ranged from projects on indi-
viduals with disabilities, to 
ones on social mobility and 
HIV testing.

Skeleton found near campus

Human remains were found 

Sunday afternoon in a Gaines-
ville, Fla., pine tree forest by 
the University of Florida’s 
campus, The Independent 
Florida Alligator reported 
Monday.

The Alachua County Sher-

iff’s Office received a call Sun-

A press release announced the 
investigation Monday after-
noon.

Art Forgey, spokesman for 

the department, told the Alli-
gator that the skeleton’s age, 
sex and cause of death are 
uncertain, and that the scene 
would be cleared by Monday 
night.

“The remains will be loaded 

up and taken to the medical

said.

Evidence was report-

edly been found at the scene, 
according to the Alligator, but 
the search will continue until 
identification is obtained.

UNC researchers create 

lung cancer treatment

University of North Carolina 

researchers developed a meth-
od of treating drug-resistant 
lung cancer using 50 times less 
chemotherapy, The Daily Tar-
heel reported Sunday.

Elena Batrokova, senior 

author of the study, said she 
wants to “load tumors with 

anti-cancer drugs” so patients 
have higher chance of survival.

“We are developing new 

drug formulations that will 
allow drugs to be more effi-
cient and pass through bar-
riers,” Batrokova told the 
Tarheel. “I’m taking potent 
drugs that may not be work-
ing and developing their drug 
delivery systems.”

Batrokova had help from 

colleagues at the Eshelman 
School of Pharmacy’s Cen-
ter for Nanotechnology in 
Drug Delivery. If the drug is 
pharmaceutically accepted, it 
would mean fewer side effects 
and greater chance of recovery 
for lung cancer patients.

LSA junior David Schaffer speaks at a Central Student Government meeting in the Michigan Union on Nov. 10, 2015.
CSG talks enhancing race 
and ethnicity requirements 

Assembly 

members bring two 
resolutions to the 
floor for review at 
Tuesday’s meeting

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

At their Tuesday meeting, 

Central Student Government 
discussed 
resolutions 
that 

would aim to enhance and 
strengthen 
the 
University’s 

race and ethnicity require-
ments.

CSG voted on two resolu-

tions pertaining to the require-
ment. 
The 
first 
resolution 

supported the expansion of the 
R&E requirement to all Uni-
versity undergraduate schools 
and colleges. Currently, it only 
applies to Literature, Science 
and Arts students. Some other 

colleges have similarly themed 
curriculum aspects, such as the 
Identity, Diversity and Organi-
zations requirement in the Ross 
School of Business.

“We think it’s important that 

all students are being taught 
this,” said LSA representative 
Micah Griggs, an LSA junior. 
“It provides students with the 
skills to work in a multi-ethnic 
environment.”

Rackham 
student 
Trevis 

Harrold asked about expand-
ing the requirement to gradu-
ate schools as well. However, 
Public Policy junior Lakshman 
Mulperi, a CSG representative, 
said this currently is not a fea-
sible goal because CSG doesn’t 
have resources to expand it to 
all graduate colleges as well.

Before referring the resolu-

tion to the review committee, 
representatives 
suggested 
a 

clarification be added to deter-
mine whether or not other 
schools would develop their 

own requirement or adopt 
LSA’s current standard.

LSA’s R&E requirement was 

established in 1990 in response 
to the 1987 Black Action Move-
ment after a series of racist 
and discriminatory incidents 
against students of color that 
took place on campus. The res-
olution highlighted that such 
instances 
of 
discrimination 

and intolerance continue to ail 
students today. Expanding the 
requirement to all colleges was 
also one of the seven demands 
issued by the Black Student 
Union as part of the #BBUM 
movement in 2014.

The second resolution con-

sidered by CSG called for the 
establishment of a support 
center for R&E courses, simi-
lar to other centers such as the 
Sweetland Writing Center, the 
Michigan Language Center and 
the Science Learning Center. 
Course support was discussed

In a press release, Weaver said 

the most essential part of the 
process is getting the necessary 
supplies to those who need them.

“We need help in the form of 

supplies including water, filters 
and water test kits,” she said. 
“We also need help distributing 
those supplies to get them in the 
hands of the people who need 
them most.”

State Sen. Jim Ananich (D–

Flint) said his team is working 
on addressing the issue at three 
levels: immediate, short-term 
and long-term responses. He 
said the immediate priority is 
ensuring citizens have access to 
bottled water and filtration sys-
tems, while the short- and long-
term actions involve monitoring 
the health of affected individu-
als and repairing infrastructure.

Peter Jacobson, professor of 

health law and policy, said it’s 
important for the government to 
take steps to provide follow-up 
health care for affected citizens, 
especially children exposed to 
lead, and pay for water costs.

“The pressure should be from 

the state and federal govern-

ment, to provide Flint with the 
resources the city will need to 
monitor the children and to pro-
vide counseling and educational 
health therapy,” he said. “The 
state of Michigan should pay the 
water bills for Flint residents 
until the water is safe to drink.”

This week, the state Senate 

will be reviewing a bill recent-
ly passed in the state House 
approving an emergency request 
from Snyder for $28 million in 
emergency funding for both 
short and long-term needs.

Ananich said the city is now 

able to adequately supply resi-
dents with the water and filtra-
tion systems they need due to 
donations, meaning the focus 
moving forward should be on 
longer-term health monitoring.

“All sorts of folks are now pro-

viding a really good amount of 
water to my community,” he said. 
“We’ve almost sort of turned the 
corner on the immediate need. 
The most important focus is to 
get these kids assessed to see 
what kind of issues they may 
have long-term and place them 
in programs to make sure they 
get the individualized help they 
need.”

According to state Rep. Shel-

don Neeley (D–Flint), the state 

House is also preparing to con-
sider a series of bills as part of 
the Water Quality and Afford-
ability Package; however the 
bills have not yet been scheduled 
for hearings. 

Along with the legislative and 

executive actions, the U.S. Attor-
ney’s office has also launched 
an investigation into the crisis, 
spearheaded by former Wayne 
County 
assistant 
prosecutor 

Todd Flood. However, Jacobson 
said it is unlikely that any indi-
viduals will be charged because 
of an emergency manager law 
enacted during Snyder’s first 
term as governor. The law allows 
the state to appoint an emergen-
cy manager at an earlier stage 
in the case of a serious financial 
emergency. Jacobson said this 
law provides the officials tasked 
with addressing the water crisis 
near immunity for the actions 
taken during an emergency situ-
ation.

Jacobson 
said 
though 
he 

doubts residents’ ability to find 
legal justice for the crisis, he still 
believes the issue was the fault of 
the government.

“The state failed here,” he 

said. “I’m not suggesting that the 
state is anything but culpable.”

Amid the crisis, UM-Flint 

officials have also launched ini-
tiatives to aid the Flint commu-
nity. Citing a campus fact sheet 
— which details that water on 
UM-Flint’s campus is filtered 
and regularly tested — UM-Flint 
Chancellor Susan Borrego issued 
aletter to students on Monday 
assuring them campus water 
was safe. According to Borrego, 
UM-Flint installed water filters 
across campus after the city 
advised residents to boil their 
water in the fall of 2014.

Flint residents have also been 

advised by the state to use filtra-
tion systems in their homes, and 
various groups have donated fil-
ters and water bottles to citizens.

Terese Olson, professor of 

civil and environmental engi-
neering, said it is unclear how 
effective these filtration systems 
truly are, and they should be 
carefully monitored.

“These filters are designed to 

treat water that’s been polished 
already,” she said. “It’s an uncer-
tain question how well they will 
work or how long they will work, 
and there’s not a lot of guidance

GREG GOSS/Daily

Montana Stevenson, graduate student in the School of Natural Resources and Environment, speaks on issues ranging 
from food scarcity to racial injustices during the Food Justice Panel at the Dana Building on Tuesday.

within cities like Detroit.

“This is legal segregation,” 

Bernardo said. “This is what it 
looks like.”

Another panelist, Mama Han-

ifa Adjuman, who is the Educa-
tion and Outreach Director of 
the Detroit Black Community 
Food Security Network, said the 
city of Detroit doesn’t need mis-
sionaries, but rather needs allies.

While working with DBCFSN, 

Adjuman said the organization 
noticed a new phenomenon in 
the city of Detroit: Young, subur-
ban white people were coming to 
the city to teach members of the 
Black community how to garden.

“To come into the city and 

begin to garden was not the 
issue, it wasn’t even the prob-
lem,” Adjuman said. “To dis-
respect 
the 
traditions, 
to 

disrespect the residents in the 
city of Detroit — residents who 
have for thousands of years been 
engaged with agriculture — was 
the problem.”

Adjuman said the most effec-

tive movements happen organi-
cally by the people who will be 
most affected by the decisions.

“This is a grassroots commu-

nity organization that came out 
of the people in Detroit — the 

Black community in Detroit, first 
identifying a very real problem 
and then coming together collec-
tively to create a solution to that 
problem,” she said.

Panelists Whitney Smith and 

Montana Stevenson, both gradu-
ate students in the School of 
Natural Resources and Environ-
ment, focused their presentation 
on the Ypsilanti food system.

Their research examined food 

accessibility for impoverished 
areas of Ypsilanti by examining 
the public transportation system 
to those areas of the city.

Smith and Stevenson first 

identified where residents in or 
near Ypsilanti could buy food, 
including both traditional food 
stores as well as pharmacies, 
farmers markets and food banks.

Their results concluded that 

some of Ypsilanti’s most impov-
erished areas do not have access 
to bus lines, and therefore don’t 
have access to affordable and 
nutritious food.

“Access is still a critical part of 

food justice, and it is very impor-
tant to this conversation,” Smith 
said.

Panelist Carla Dhillon dis-

cussed what she described as 
the 
unjust 
appropriation 
of 

native communities’ food sys-
tems through government trea-
ties, highlighting how colonists 
arrived in the United States 

and erased native people and 
their culture and have therefore 
greatly altered their food sys-
tems.

She also said native food sys-

tems, such as sacred wild rice, 
have become more difficult to 
cultivate since native popula-
tions have been relocated to res-
ervations.

“The many ways that settler 

America disrupts collective food 
relations represent forms of food 
injustice,” Dhillon said.

LSA senior Claire Roos, who 

was also one of the event’s orga-
nizers, said the event was cre-
ated to recognize that while food 
sustainability is an often-dis-
cussed topic, food justice is not.

“Oftentimes we forget to 

address the social justice side,” 
Roos said. “You can’t have sus-

Business 
junior 
Courtney 

Maliszewski, who attended the 
event, said it particularly inter-
ested her because of current 
health and nutrition concerns 
addressed in the media in Flint 
and Detroit. 

“I really took away how 

it affects so many different 
groups,” Maliszewski said. “And 
I definitely think that is some-
thing more people need to be 
aware of.”

since its start in 2012.

“I think that resonated with 

a lot of people who use social 
media for dating purposes and 
have 
been 
really 
frustrated 

with the way they’ve been 
approached,” she said.

Kellie Carbone, a health edu-

cator at Wolverine Wellness and 
director of the event, said the 
evening’s theme was “surren-
der,” because everything that 
could have gone wrong, did go 
wrong, in each student’s story.

“That was half-joking,” she 

said. “But it does seem like each 
time the performer went to per-
form, their pieces constellated 
around some type of theme, 
some similarity that they can 
draw from each piece.”

Public Health graduate stu-

dent Kristen Harden said she 
found the storytelling format of 
the event engaging and power-
ful.

“It’s a really awesome way to 

put out messages about things 
like positive body image and pro-
moting health and wellness on 
campus,” Harden said. “I think 
this is really great and wanted 
to come and see that. It’s a really 
nice sign of solidarity and sup-
port.”

Harden said she thought the 

night’s theme resonated with her 
the most.

“Surrendering to self-love and 

to support and just being you is 
wonderful,” she said. “Just sur-
rendering to being comfortable 
with yourself and loving who 
you are.

Public Health graduate stu-

dent Kathleen Koviak said she 
learned not to be afraid of herself 
by listening to the monologues at 
the event.

“It’s all just to be yourself and 

love yourself for who you are 
and to share your story and what 
makes you, you,” she said.

It’s important students attend 

the event and experience the 
performer and their stories, 
Carbone said, because of what 
she described as a campus-wide 
obsession with attaining perfec-

tion.

“They’re used to being the 

best, the brightest,” she said. “A 
lot of the research we’ve done on 
campus shows that the student 
population as a whole is also 
really reluctant to ask for help or 
admit that anything is wrong.”

Carbone said the storytelling 

format has encouraged students 
to craft their own narratives and 
share them with an audience.

“What we have found when 

we started doing workshops and 
events like this, is that when 
you give people an opportunity 
to say what’s going on, the light 
bulb goes off for other people,” 
Carbone said. “Our goal is to 
challenge some of the stigmas 
that exist on our campus, espe-
cially around appearance and 
perfection and attractiveness 
and weight.”

Susan Ernst, director of Uni-

versity Health Services gynecol-
ogy department and assistant 
professor of obstetrics and gyne-
cology, earned a grant for a pro-
posal pertaining to medical care 
in Ethopia.

Ernst runs a gynecology clinic 

at the University for adolescents 
and women with disabilities, 
and has been working to offer 
similar services at the St. Paul’s 
Hospital and Millennium Medi-
cal Center in Ethiopia.

Ernst said the Ethiopian Cen-

ter for Disability and Develop-
ment and the Ethiopian Women 
Disabilities National Organiza-
tion both acknowledged there 
were barriers preventing adoles-
cents and women with disabili-
ties from receiving reproductive 
health services. Because of this, 
she began working on a proposal 
with the aim of creating focus 
groups with these demographics 
to gather information about the 
obstacles to receiving medical 
care.

Ernst plans to survey the 

administrators, 
faculty 
and 

nurses at the hospital about their 
difficulties in providing care for 
their patients, such as the physi-
cal barriers patients with severe 
disabilities face from hospitals 
not being properly equipped to 
assist them.

“Our ultimate goal is to try 

to improve those services that 
are not only offered at St. Paul’s, 
but throughout other reproduc-
tive health care clinics in Ethio-
pia,” Ernst said. “In the United 
States we have code and all of 
the buildings have to be built to 
code for patients with disabili-
ties, but there, some of the clin-
ics may not have a ramp to get 
up into the clinic area, or even if 
the patients can get up into the 
clinic area, the doorways might 
not be accessible for somebody 
in a wheelchair.”

Ernst said she appreciates the 

award because it has allowed her 
to collaborate with individuals 
from Ethiopia, the University of 
Michigan and University of Cen-
tral Florida.

“This 
money 
allows 
the 

research team to not only go back 
to Ethiopia and do this work, but 
to actually hire women with dis-
abilities in Ethiopia to help us as 
study coordinators and to pay 
the adolescents and women with 
disabilities to be a part of our 
focus group and just to work in a 
collaborative manner to address 
this problem,” Ernst said.

Other 
recipients 
included 

Nancy Fleischer, an assistant 
professor of epidemiology and 
Elizabeth King, assistant profes-
sor in health behavior and health 
education.

Fleischer said her project 

is focused on the role of social 
mobility in racial and ethnic dis-
parities and infant health. With 
the grant, Fleischer said she will 
be constructing a multi-gen-
erational data set to link birth 
certificate data across multiple 
generations to understand cross-

generational social mobility and 
to see if that is related to adverse 
birth outcomes such as prema-
ture birth.

As part of the grant, Fleischer 

said she has been able to hire a 
graduate student who has been 
doing work on Institutional 
Review Board applications and 
data request applications. She 
also said the award has allowed 
her to work with colleagues in 
South Carolina, as well as at 
Michigan State University.

“It has been helpful for mak-

ing connections across campus, 
since I started my faculty posi-
tion just in September of 2015, 
and don’t have the research 
linkages 
already,” 
Fleischer 

said. “I am very grateful to have 
received it and I look forward to 
doing the work.”

King said she’s planning on 

working 
with 
collaborators 

in Russia to do a qualitative 
research study on why women 
who test positive for HIV dur-
ing pregnancy do or do not stay 
in HIV care.

“This Seed Grant is allow-

ing us to do this project, which 
hopefully will be the foundation 
for designing an intervention 
to improve women’s outcomes 
related to getting enrolled in, 
and staying on, HIV treatment 
services,” King said. “We’re hop-
ing to use our findings from this 
project to design a program to 
help women.”

Other beneficiaries include 

Shobita Parthasarathy, associate 
professor of public policy, Musi-
cology prof. Louise Stein and 
Ruth Tsoffar, associate profes-
sor of women’s studies and com-
parative literature.

Stein is planning to utilize the 

funding she received from the 
IRWG to pay for travel to Italy. 
Her research focuses on famous 
17th century alto castrato singer 
Giovanni.

She said this is an impor-

tant component to traditional 
Italian gender roles because 
Grossi seems to represent the 
emergence of a new kind of mas-
culinity. In particular, Stein said 
she’s interested in understand-
ing how Grossi succeeded in the 
competitive operatic market-
place, as well as how he executed 
different kinds of masculinity on 
stage.

“(The grant) will provide me 

the funding to be able to travel 
to the libraries and archives in 
Italy that have the materials I 
need,” she said. “I also appreci-
ate this because gender study is 
a new area for me ... I look for-
ward to also collaborating, get-
ting advice from scholars here at 
U of M.”

Applications for the grants, 

which are annual, opened in the 
fall. They were scored based on 
multiple criteria regarding the 
project, including its quality 
and importance, its relation to 
IRWG’s central focus on women, 
gender and sexuality, and its 
inclusion of issues regarding 
race, sexual orientation or cul-
ture. The significance of the 
project to its field as well as the 
contribution to the University 
was also taken into account.

GRANT
From Page 1A

in two student forums in the fall 
aimed at gathering feedback on 
the R&E requirement.

According to the resolution, 

the center would provide train-
ing and resources for graduate 
student instructors and profes-
sors to better facilitate sensitive 
discussions regarding race and 
ethnicity. It would also create a 
space for students to engage in 
further dialogue.

Several members expressed 

confusion about the functional-
ity of such a facility. LSA senior 
David Shafer, a CSG representa-
tive, said he appreciated the spir-
it of the resolution, but wanted 
to know more about the logistics 
of the center, such as who would 
work there and how it would 
operate.

In response, LSA junior Sean 

Pitt, CSG chief of staff, stressed 
the intent of the resolution. He 
explained that it aims to serve 
as a sign of student support for 
the proposal to the University’s 
administration so that the LSA 
committee currently reviewing 
the R&E requirement will fur-
ther entertain the creation of a 
support center for R&E courses. 
The committee could then work 
to strategize and develop specif-
ics.

The resolution was referred 

to the resolutions committee for 
further review. Shafer also sug-
gested hosting a forum to gain 
feedback for such a center.

Guest Speakers
LSA senior Adam Waggoner, 

chair of the Student Organization 
Funding Commission, updated 
CSG on the commission’s activi-
ties at Tuesday’s meeting. SOFC 
is the branch of CSG that makes 
funding decisions to support stu-
dent organizations on campus.

Waggoner said SOFC’s budget 

was about $200,000 last semes-
ter, which represents about half 
of CSG’s. $198, 927 was reim-
bursed to student organizations 
by the end of the semester. Stu-
dent groups requested nearly 
half a million dollars in funding 
total, and slightly over a quarter 
million dollars were awarded. 
He explained that demand for 
funding has been increasing 
both because of a rise in requests 
and easier accessibility due to 
the online application.

This semester’s budget has 

been raised to $225,000; howev-
er, Waggoner said it’s not propor-
tional to the increase in demand.

Out of the nine periods of 

funding CSG divides the semes-
ter into, seven waves remain for 
this semester.

we can give people except to be 
conservative.”

Neeley said one of the most 

important steps for the commu-
nity to take is restoring trust in 
the government.

“We have to go back and 

rebuild the trust and confidence 
of those in the geographical area 
who were severely impacted so 
they can feel comfortable living

“Y

our neighborhood actually looks 
kind of nice in the summer,” 
my friend remarked from the 

passenger’s seat as 
we turned from the 
service 
drive 
onto 

my street. It was a 
particularly 
sunny 

day in June, and all 
of the windows in my 
shabby 2003 Saturn 
L200 were lowered 
to usher in the warm 
breeze. 
The 
trees 

that lined the road 
were beginning to 
bud — the epilogue of 
another prolonged winter.

I rarely ever brought friends to my house 

(it was a 40-minute commute from school 
and back) and my hometown did not offer 
much in the way of entertainment. Forsaking 
the journey home would mean we would 
have access to nice restaurants, bookstores, 
movie theaters and shops — a simple cost-
benefit analysis revealed that it was probably 
advisable not to bother at all — and yet there 
we were, tourists among the factories and the 
lawns peppered with fast food wrappers.

As her passive words hung in the air for what 

felt like an eternity, mingling with the sounds 
of chirping birds and droning lawn mowers, 
I became acutely aware of my surroundings. 
The cracks in the pavement became a little 
deeper, the white shingles a little dirtier. I 
wondered how the street on which I grew up 
looked from the outside, a patch of ramshackle 
suburbia. My hands tightened on the wheel as 
I felt the blood leave my face and slowly drain 
— boiling hot — into my ears.

This 
embarrassment 
was 
more 
than 

familiar to me; my go-to defense mechanism 
against people who scrutinize my background 

has always been self-deprecation. When I 
switched schools after my freshman year of 
high school, it only intensified as I made a 
point of complaining about my hometown to 
my well-to-do friends, and as a result, they 
considered it acceptable to make similar 
comments, which sounded colder and more 
malicious coming from them than they did 
from me. I figured if I pointed and laughed 
with them, then I could alleviate some of the 
burden of not being one of them.

“Yeah, a lot of people drop out or end up 

pregnant,” was how I described my former 
high school to peers at my new school.

“It’s just a working- class suburb,” is how I 

have come to describe my hometown to friends 
in college.

But there is so much more to it than that, 

and I know that all too well.

Through my window, I scanned the rows 

of tiny houses that twinkled in the winter and 
emitted an overbearing glow in the summer. 
I idly traced the ribbon of sidewalk that 
once guided my bike as it drifted toward the 
humming interstate and facilitated the journey 
of a green wagon that kept my brother and me 
under the watchful eye of our mother. This 
was home. This was all I knew of the world in 
the first 15 years or so of my life — this street, 
these people, this town. Why couldn’t I admit 
that to myself? Why was I so eager to distance 
myself from it?

There is absolutely no shame in coming 

from a modest background, a sub-par school 
district, or a neighborhood that only looks 
“kind of nice” in certain seasons, damn it. 
Wanting more than anything to convey this 
notion to my friend, I paused for a second and 
searched for an appropriate response, but all I 
could muster was a quiet: “Thanks.”

To be ashamed of home

W

hen one of your best 
friends is a guy, there 
are some conversations 

that arise over 
and over again. 
Our 
recurrent 

discussions often 
turned 
into 
a 

lighthearted, 
odd and almost 
subverted “battle 
of 
the 
sexes,” 

in 
which 
we’d 

debate about who 
had it “worse” — 
me or him. He’d 
complain 
about 

constricting and seriously flawed 
measurements of masculinity and 
about the discrimination he faced 
in a heteronormative society. I’d 
complain about sexism, inequality 
and the wage gap. We’d eventually 
both concede we both had to deal 
with society placing unrealistic 
body expectations upon us.

These “debates” started when we 

were teenagers with worldviews 
just beginning to expand beyond 
the borders of our tiny, rural 
hometown. Now, while we still both 
joke about individual challenges, 
our 
conversations 
hopefully 

include a better understanding 
of intersectionality and our own 
particular sets of privilege.

When we were still both just 

stubborn kids trying to understand 
the unfamiliar worlds we were 
about to enter, the earlier versions 
of these discussions were all about 
winning the argument. I tended to, 
as the argument escalated, bring up 
the topic that silenced every other 
man in my life — from my dad to 
my brothers to the rest of my male 
friends. 
Experience 
taught 
me 

that once you bring up anything 
minutely menstrual, most men get 
uncomfortable 
and 
desperately 

want to switch the topic.

So, there I was, aggressively 

pointing out that, in this debate, 
I was the only one dealing with 
bleeding, bloating and cramping 
monthly. My best friend, who has 
an older sister, was completely 
unfazed. This was also typically 
the cue for a teacher, a classmate, 
a neighbor or a waiter to interrupt 
our conversation and overhear me 
mid-rant. Then they’d leave and 
I’d be embarrassed, and my friend 
would laugh hysterically. Amid the 
laughter, he’d agree with me and 
acknowledge that his understanding 
of the subject was probably lacking.

Today, the same scenario is 

still at play, except on a larger 

scale. Menstration is still a taboo 
discussion 
topic. 
If 
you’re 
an 

individual who experiences this 
biologically driven red mess every 
month, you’re expected to deal with 
it as discreetly as possible. You don’t 
talk about it, and you certainly don’t 
let there be any visible evidence. 
Yet, the individuals who decide how 
much it’s going to cost to ensure this 
discretion are most likely men who 
don’t understand the experience. 
They treat the products women use 
to manage and hide this bothersome 
natural process as “luxury items” 
that deserve to be taxed.

Numerous 
states 
provide 

exemptions 
for 
products 
that 

are deemed necessities, such as 
food, prescriptions, a selection 
of 
over-the-counter 
medicines 

and prosthetics. There are even 
some states that have removed the 
sales tax on clothing purchases. 
However, Michigan is currently 
one of roughly 40 states that 
impose a “tampon tax.” Feminine 
hygiene products, such as tampons, 
sanitary pads and other similar 
products are subject to Michigan’s 
6-percent sales tax, simply due 
to being labeled in legislation as 
“luxury 
items.” 
Anyone 
who’s 

actually 
ever 
experienced 
a 

menstrual cycle would find this 
terminology ironic. The absolute 
last thing someone would describe 
using these products as is as a 
“luxury.”

Even President Obama, in an 

interview last Friday, displayed 
some confusion regarding both 
the classification and the tax by 
stating: “I have no idea why states 
would tax these as ‘luxury items’ 
... I suspect it’s because men were 
making the laws when those taxes 
were passed.” Obama encouraged 
citizens and states to make “local 
level” changes to address the highly 
gendered tax. In particular, he 
mentioned a recent bill in California 
that seeks to remove the sales tax 
from feminine hygiene products, 
such as pads and tampons. Doing 
so would alleviate the financial 
burden, in a myriad of states, on a 
population of individuals who are 
already subject to a substantial 
wage gap.

Even the tiniest of additional 

costs tacked onto a purchase can add 
up, especially for women of lower 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds. 
A 

news release stated that Californian 
women pay roughly $7 each month 
for 40 years of tampons and pads. 
These purchases accrue to “over $20 
million annually in taxes.”

The 
United 
States 
certainly 

isn’t the only country disputing 
a “tampon tax.” Canada recently 
removed 
the 
tax 
on 
feminine 

hygiene products this past summer. 
The initiative was followed this past 
fall by protests in Britain to follow 
Canada’s example and abolish the 
tax. Women wore white pants and 
no form of hygiene product while 
they were on their periods.

Some may argue that tampons 

and sanitary pads are akin to other 
everyday products. However, these 
products are a necessity — one 
that’s also heavily insisted upon by 
society. Cultural standards strongly 
stigmatize the idea of women 
bleeding in public and view it as 
unsanitary. Women and girls rely 
upon these products to continue 
leading their normal lifestyle — 
whether that involves working, 
going to classes, playing sports or 
just generally being in public. These 
products 
also 
protect 
women’s 

clothing and ensure their hygiene.

Additionally, if one is going 

to argue against removing the 
“tampon tax,” they must also 
consider that women are most 
likely already paying inflated prices 
for grooming products, such as 
shampoo and deodorant. Thanks to 
a highly gendered price discrepancy 
known commonly as the “pink tax,” 
a product designed for women, 
even when there’s an identical 
product intended for men, may cost 
more simply because of its pink or 
purple packaging or its particularly 
“feminine” fragrance.

While women may avoid unfair 

gendered pricing by buying the 
cheaper men’s alternative, there’s 
no male equivalent for tampons 
and sanitary pads. Women have 
instead been expected to pay 
an extra tax for decades on 
a 
necessity 
that’s 
mistakenly 

referred to as a “luxury item,” in 
addition to extra fees on grooming 
products. State governments and 
businesses must stop treating the 
gender and biological processes 
of their consumers as something 
they can take advantage of for 
financial gain, especially when the 
wage gap still remains a prevalent 
issue. Perhaps we can remedy the 
pricing discrepancies by creating 
more 
gender-neutral 
products, 

but until then, state legislators can 
ease women’s financial burdens by 
removing an unnecessary tax on a 
monthly necessity.

A misplaced luxury

LAUREN 
SCHANDEVEL

MELISSA 
SCHOLKE

I 

was bulimic in high school. Before writing 
this, the only person I had ever told was my 
cousin Marissa. We were sharing secrets 

around a campfire, unhinged by one too many 
bottles of wine. Even under 
the influence of alcohol and 
emotions, I knew she would 
understand.

I don’t exactly remem-

ber the first time I stuck my 
hand in my mouth, fingers 
stretching toward the back 
of my throat to activate my 
gag reflex. For months, I 
tried not eating, and run-
ning as much as I could with 
little to no results. Eventu-
ally, I began to think about 
alternative options.

April 17, 2009 — I need to figure out how to 

throw up and get better self-discipline. Or I’m 
going to be huge.

Two months later, I apparently figured it 

out.

June 15, 2009 — I barely eat. When I do, I 

throw it up. But I’m in control, so it’s ok.

Twice I thought I was going to be caught, 

but no one ever figured it out. As the months 
passed, I became increasingly concerned with 
my behavior.

Aug. 26, 2009 — Sometimes when I throw up, 

it worries me. What if it ruins my body? I don’t 
know. It just freaks me out. But it’s hard to stop. 
Food just smells too good. And tastes too good. 
It’s just hard. And NOBODY at all has noticed.

In my senior year of high school, though my 

home life was still hectic, I made some incred-
ible friends and never returned to that familiar 
position above the toilet. I felt selfish for what 
I was doing to my body and knew the people I 
love would be concerned if they knew.

I stopped throwing up before enrolling at 

the University in 2011, yet my diet remained 
destructive. When trying to eat healthy in the 
dining halls during my first two years in col-
lege, I reverted to the salad bar; it was all I had 
ever known. Eventually, I began to familiarize 
myself with different foods and how they sup-
port the human body. I watched documenta-
ries and surrounded myself with people who 
had positive relationships with food.

At nearly 23 years old, I’m the most confi-

dent I’ve ever been in my life. I eat food that 
I love — cheese, pasta, chips, bread, chocolate 
— but I also consider the moral, environmen-
tal and health implications before making a 
purchase. It took a long time, and a lot of edu-
cation, but I’m finally able to understand my 
teenaged behavior.

While I now feel confident enough to admit 

that I suffer from disordered eating, there are 
many University students who struggle in 
silence.

In 2012, Ph.D. student Sarah Ketchen-Lip-

son initiated the University Study of Habits, 
Attitudes, and Perceptions Around Eating 

student survey. With the help of Suzanne 
Dooley-Hash, an assistant professor of emer-
gency medicine, and an interdisciplinary team, 
U-SHAPE was published at the 2013 Student 
Life Research Symposium, formerly the Divi-
sion of Student Affairs Research Symposium.

According to the survey, 28 percent of 

female and 12 percent of male undergradu-
ate students, and 21 percent of female and 10 
percent of male graduate students, screened 
positive for disordered eating. Additionally, 18 
percent of females and 6 percent of males indi-
cated that food and weight dominates their life. 
Among those with disordered eating, interna-
tional students, sorority members, LGBTQ 
students and students who experienced abuse 
are disproportionately affected. Disordered 
eating is also correlated with mental illnesses 
such as anxiety and depression.

In a conversation about why students decide 

not to seek help, Julie Stocks, University 
Health Services registered dietician nutrition-
ist, said, “It’s important if you feel that it’s an 
issue in your life to seek treatment. And it’s a 
great opportunity when you’re here to find 
wonderful, highly skilled treatment.”

Stocks affirmed that there’s plenty of infor-

mation available to University students about 
ways to maintain a balanced diet — online 
webinars and nutritional information, dining 
hall dieticians, the UHS Nutrition Clinic, sup-
port groups at Counseling and Psychological 
Services, etc. But people struggling with dis-
ordered eating cannot be forced to use these 
resources. 

Overall, Stocks noted that students — and 

people in general — need to be realistic when it 
comes to weight, diet and exercise. Though the 
media constantly bombards us with images of 
how we should look, comparing ourselves to a 
chart or another person tends to lead to more 
destructive behaviors. Instead, Stocks recom-
mended we focus on being healthful and eating 
foods that are good for our bodies. We need to 
seek help when faced with irrational thoughts. 
We need to be vocal about our anxieties, our 
depression and our body image. When that 
happens, Stocks assured me, natural weight 
will go where it needs to be.

It’s not an easy road, to say the least; some 

people will never recover from disordered 
eating. But there’s always hope. In the past 
three years, I’ve internalized a lot of the advice 
Stocks gave me during our conversation in my 
own time. I’m at a healthy weight, I eat nutri-
tional food and I’m constantly on the move. I 
recognize that I have certain anxieties, and I 
work proactively to combat them. Sometimes 
though, the past still haunts me.

author Paul Lisicky said, offering 
his advice to aspiring writers in a 
phone interview with The Michi-
gan Daily. Lisicky is the author of 
five books and currently teaches 
in 
the 
MFA 

Creative Writ-
ing Program at 
Rutgers 
Uni-

versity. 
His 

most 
recent 

publication 
is 

The 
Narrow 

Door, 
from 

which he’ll be 
reading on Fri-
day at Literati.

The Narrow Door, accord-

ing to Lisicky, is a memoir that 
explores the process of mourn-
ing in honor of his dear friend 
and fellow writer Denise Guess 
who passed away six years ago. It 
also tracks the decline of his rela-
tionship with his husband, Mark 
Doty. 

“In part it’s an investigation of 

our friendship but it also wants 
to think about what the loss of 
her unkenneled in me,” Lisicky 
said. “It’s about our friendship; 
it’s also about the breakup of my 
long relationship. It’s about Joni 
Mitchell. It’s about storms. It’s 
about Vincent Van Gogh. There 
are a lot of side pieces that I hope 
activate the main story lines.”

Lisicky defined his arrival in 

the writing world as an amalga-
mation of his early identities as a 
musician and an introvert — two 

factors that have allowed him to 
explore the way an inner voice is 
translated into art.

“I think I probably started 

writing because I sensed that I 
was smarter inside than I was 
able to express to other people,” 
Lisicky said. “I was so shy that 
I rarely talked in the classroom, 
never raised my hand, and would 
fumble if someone called on me. I 
think I had a low level fear that I 
might have just seemed a little bit 
dim and it was important for me 
to develop my language at least 
on the page.”

Although he identifies as an 

introvert, the candor and enthu-
siasm with which he spoke sug-
gested otherwise. He expressed a 
passion for his work as a creative 
writing instructor and anticipa-
tion for the travels that will allow 
him to share his works with a 
larger audience.

That being said, he also clari-

fied the inherent introversion of 
the creative process.

“I think every writer has to be 

in large part an introvert because 
so much of what we do is about 
the investigation of the inner life 
and we’re thinking about privacy 
and hiddenness. It just goes with 
the territory I think,” he said.

Lisicky said his experiences as 

a musician have allowed him to 
explore the way his inner voice 
manifests itself in a public way. 
He joked that his singing voice 
is “not terribly distinguished” 
in the way that his expression 
through his prose is.

“There’s not that much subtle-

ty and nuance in my singing voice 
but weirdly I feel like I know how 
to go after shadows and nuances 

and complicated sounds in my 
written voice,” he said. 

Having achieved a level of pres-

tige as writer, it was surprising to 
hear that Lisicky’s early ambition 
was to pursue music; writing was 
something that came serendipi-
tously.

“I was a musician, and I was 

very serious about it through my 
mid-20s,” Lisicky said. “It was 
really hard to turn my energy 
away from that world initially. I 
ended up taking a creative writing 
workshop on a whim and it was 
just out of a sense of play.”

His 
musical 
experience 
is 

inseparable from his writing — 
although Lisicky writes mostly 
prose, his grasp of sound gives his 
work a poetic quality.

“I still think of music in rela-

tion to what I do,” he said. “I think 
about music in relationship to 
how I phrase a sentence, where I 
pause and where I put commas so 
I always start with a voice before 
I start with image. I believe that 
has to do with my origins as a 
musician or a frustrated singer.”

Lisicky identified the work of 

another Joy Williams as writing 
that he’s always admired.

“That work still nourishes me, 

still teaches me, still reveals facets 
of itself every time I come back to 
it,” he said.

He seeks to embody the reflec-

tive, that which amplifies itself in 
a way that generates surprise and 
evolution with each encounter. 
These themes prove increasingly 
relevant in The Narrow Door, 
which presents an exploration 
of loss and the nuances of emo-
tional vulnerability that grow and 
change with age.

TV REVIEW
Clownin’ in ‘Baskets’

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily TV/New Media Editor

TV 
comedy 
has 
grown 

increasingly diverse in an era of 
unmatched choice in television, 
a 
time 
that 

FX President 
John Landgraf 
has 
referred 

to 
as 
“peak 

TV”. 
From 

traditional 
multi-camera 
fare, 
com-

monly 
seen 

on 
networks 

like 
CBS 
in 

the 
form 
of 

shows like “The Big Bang The-
ory” and “Two Broke Girls,” 
to the insanely twisted buddy 
dynamics explored by the likes 
of “Broad City” and “Workahol-
ics,” television comedy is a vast 
landscape with shows that blur 
the lines between the comedic 
and dramatic (“Jane the Virgin” 
and “Shameless”) or completely 
dip into the absurd (“Man Seek-
ing Woman” and “Review”).

“Baskets” is a beneficiary of this 

broad comedic spectrum. With 
its odd subject matter, off-putting 
protagonist and occasionally delib-
erate slow pacing, “Baskets” is a 
show that very well, might not 
have existed in any other time of 
television — presenting an alterna-
tive comedic choice for audiences.

Co-created 
by 
Louis 
C.K. 

(“Louie”), Zach Galifianakis (“The 
Hangover”) and Jonathan Krisel 
(“Portlandia”), “Baskets” follows 
failed clown Chip Baskets (Gali-
fianakis) as he returns to Bakers-
field, California after dropping 
out of a French clown academy, 
due to the fact that he can’t speak 
French. Best viewed with a raised 
eyebrow, Chip isn’t the most 
approachable figure. Portrayed 
with simultaneous deadpan and 
boiling volatility by Galifianakis, 
the character is funny but also 
incredibly pathetic. Failing in his 
artistic ambition, the poor guy 
clings to any hope of achieving his 
dream as he becomes a completely 
out-of-place rodeo clown, mar-
ries an unloving French woman 
(Sabina Sciubba, “Stop Here”) and 
struggles to pull together $40 so 
his new wife can get HBO. It’s a 
sad, pitiable existence, but Gali-
fianakis sells it, defiantly saying, 
“I am a clown. I always will be a 
clown!”

Chip is the definition of a sad 

clown, yet no one (except the 
audience) is laughing at him. If 
you placed him in the famous 
Pagliacci joke, the doctor would 
still recommend Pagliacci. Chip 
would bring up that he is a clown 
as well and the doctor would say 
that he’s never heard of him. That 
is the existence of Chip, trapped 
in unhappy anonymity.

Directed by Krisel, the first 

episode, “Renoir,” effectively cap-
tures Chip’s washed out existence. 

Trapped in Bakersfield, Chip 
is cast against the flat browns 
and tans of the desert area as he 
reaches for any sort of relevancy, 
or even dignity for that matter. As 
insurance agent and possibly only 
friend Martha (Martha Kelly, 
“Ladies Night Out”) drives Chip 
to his motel, the clown mutters, 
“It’s only permanent.” With its 
dead end town, “Baskets” touches 
on the fear of failure and what 
might happen if we don’t accom-
plish what we initially set out for.

Lightening up this somewhat 

depressing reality is the usually 
absurd humor, often provided 
by the residents of Bakersfield. 
Particular standouts are Chip’s 
mom (Louie Anderson, “Life with 
Louie”) who expresses her disap-
pointment with her son, all with a 
smile on her face, and Chip’s twin 
brother Dale (also played by Gali-
fianakis), “dean, student, and jani-
tor” of Baskets Career College.

With so many choices in TV 

today, “Baskets” presents an 
alternative experience for a niche 
audience, with an almost depress-
ing premise that successfully 
doesn’t fall into misery by the 
graces of its mix of deadpan and 
ridiculous sensibilities. In fact, 
underneath the entire struggle is 
a sense of hope at the end of the 
episode. The appearance of a new 
title card signals a new beginning 
for Chip as he begins his journey. 
This clown may just get the last 
laugh yet.

FILM COLUMN

Spike Lee’s 

cinematic activism
A

s I sat in my seat at 
the State Theater this 
weekend, I had the 

unfortunate experience of seeing 
the trailer for Michael Moore’s 
new movie, 
“Where 
to Invade 
Next.” When 
the trailer 
finally ended 
after two-
and-a-half 
minutes of 
self-aggran-
dizement, 
I shook my 
head and softly muttered under 
my breath, “God, I hate Michael 
Moore.”

You can still subscribe to the 

same ideology as Moore while 
flatly loathing him, his films 
or what he stands for. What-
ever purpose or original intent 
Moore has when he concocts his 
so-called documentaries, the 
final cuts never seem to show 
it — whatever points or opinions 
he happens to raise, they play 
second fiddle to his own ego 
inflation.

The most blaring instance of 

his agenda setting that comes to 
my mind gets played out in his 
2002 film “Bowling for Colum-
bine,” where he “explores” guns 
and gun culture in America. He 
asserts that we as a nation are 
gun obsessed, that war monger-
ing is engrained in our public 
consciousness.

“That’s an interesting opinion, 

Mr. Moore. Please provide your 
evidence.”

Moore goes to a bank in 

Michigan where they have a spe-
cial offer: open a specific bank 
account, get a gun. Moore opens 
a bank account, and, minutes 
later, he walks out with a gun. He 
says this demonstrates the lax 
standards by which we hand out 
guns — no waiting period from 
this bank/apparent arms dealer. 
Clearly we live in a messed up 
country.

Except that scene is complete-

ly fabricated. Yes, that bank with 
that deal exists, but it mandato-
rily institutes background checks 
and three day waiting periods, 
per the law. Moore convinced 
the bank to give him the gun 
immediately because of “time 
constraints” with filming, but 
that caveat obviously didn’t make 
it into his film. Michael Moore 
lied, he fixed the rules to meet his 
agenda so that he could walk out 
of this bank with a gun held high 

and declare, “I, Michael Moore, 
am smarter than the system, and 
for that I am wiser, even better, 
than you.”

I don’t appreciate being lied 

to. And I don’t appreciate Moore 
flaunting his self-importance, 
especially because he disguises it 
under a mask of so-called “truth” 
that would otherwise inspire 
social change. And yes it’s pos-
sible to view his films as an impe-
tus for discussion, but because 
it’s a documentary, a genre asso-
ciated (falsely) with neutrality, 
people will likely accept it at face 
value as truth. Spreading false 
information is dangerous, no 
matter how good your cause, and 
empty practices in narcissism are 
a waste of time.

Which is why viewing “Chi-

Raq” last week was so refresh-
ing. This was the first Spike Lee 
film I had seen, not including the 
various snippets of “Inside Man” 
that get replayed on cable, and I 
knew little about him beyond the 
following: his film “Do the Right 
Thing” is considered a mas-
terpiece, he is prone to making 
provocative statements and he is 
boycotting the Academy Awards 
this year.

Here is a film that explores 

the same grim topic as Moore, 
guns in America, but explodes 
with vibrancy, color and emo-
tion. It follows the same premise 
as the play it’s based on, Aris-
tophanes’ Lysistrata, where a 
group of women withhold sex 
from bloodthirsty men until they 
agree to put down their arms. It 
is, above all else, a satire: in Lee’s 
world, the withholding of sex 
enacts global social change and 
ends gang violence, police bru-
tality, war, etc.

Of course, sex strikes are not 

the real, achievable solution the 
film proposes but the mecha-
nism by which Lee delivers his 
message. Instilled in this comic 
narrative are incredibly power-
ful images that are sure to reso-
nate, most notably a wrenching 
two minute scene during which 
a grieving mother desperately 
tries to clean the sidewalk of 
her daughter’s blood, spilled in a 
gang-related shooting the night 
before.

Lee tackles this topic of gun 

violence (gang-related, police-
related, military, etc.) with grace 
and the occasional challenging 
comment. His mission is not to 
preach (though he does, more on 
that momentarily) but to get the 
dialogue rolling — he offers no 

practical solution except to get 
people talking.

The centerpiece of the film is 

the rousing eulogy for the afore-
mentioned daughter, delivered 
by John Cusack’s Father Cor-
ridan. In it, Cusack blasts the 
gangs, the police, the public’s 
indifference and lack of motiva-
tion, racism, all of these core 
societal issues. It’s supposed to 
raise questions, to get us think-
ing. But what struck me the 
most was not the speech itself: 
why does Lee have the only 
substantial white character in a 
film otherwise occupied by black 
characters give the most direct 
condemnation of the American 
way of thinking? Is it because 
Cusack is the most visible of the 
cast? Is it because the real-life 
priest he’s based on is also white 
and Lee was staying factual? Or 
is it because Lee believes white 
people will only listen to a white 
man?

I don’t know the answer to 

this question, nor any question 
the film proposes. But I read a 
wealth of information on Lee and 
the reception of “Chi-Raq,” the 
criticisms it draws, and I thought 
on its reflection of America as a 
whole, which I imagine was Lee’s 
goal.

The beauty of the film stems 

from its absurdity. To quote 
from my favorite graphic novel, 
“Watchmen”: “He saw the cracks 
in society … he saw the true face 
of the twentieth century and 
chose to become a reflection of it, 
a parody of it.” And from the par-
ody of “Chi-Raq”— the hypersex-
ualized women, the hyperviolent 
men, the frequent breaking of 
the fourth wall, the music video 
moments, the outrageous practi-
cality of a sex strike — we find the 
truth of ourselves. The punchline 
should be just that: a punch.

That is effective cinematic 

activism; that grabs and holds the 
attention. Instead of basing his 
film on his own self-importance, 
his self-sacrifice in the name of 
“truth,” Spike Lee offers us a 
fantastical but equally salient 
portrait of America. I imagine 
had “Chi-Raq” received a larger 
distribution, and if more people 
saw it instead of Michael Moore’s 
latest (or any film of his), the 
dialogue “Chi-Raq” wants us to 
have, that the film very literally 
ends with, might actually occur.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

Race in ‘Translation’

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

I first watched “Lost in Trans-

lation” in high school. I got 15 
minutes in and stopped because 
it made me feel so disgusted — 
like I was disgusting. At the time, 
I didn’t know why. That was 
before I learned anything about 
Asian American activism, before 
I even realized that Asian Ameri-
cans were discriminated against. 
But after seeing the title on the 
State Theater’s board of features 
while walking home last week 
and remembering that there’s 
a famous movie with actors I 
love and by a director I love that 
I hadn’t gotten through yet, I 
watched it again and I finally 
understood — it’s grossly offen-
sive.

There is a repeating motif of 

Bob (Bill Murray, “St. Vincent”) 
and Charlotte (Scarlett Johans-
son, “Under the Skin”) being the 
only ones awake at night, mind-
lessly clicking through TV chan-
nels until the time difference loses 
its hold on them. It’s framed as a 
moment of cultural alienation, but 
since the content of the shows — 
over-the-top aggression in action 
movies, ditzy looking reality TV 
girls — is typical, the only thing 
engineering the feeling of being 
“lost in translation” is the Japa-
nese voice itself. It’s quiet, but the 
incomprehensible, loud Japanese 
are the cackling cacophony that 
interrupts the silence, jarring 
these poor white people out of 
their element. Universal behavior 
is reinterpreted with a Western-
er’s self-conceit, racialized and 
portrayed as “bizarre” interac-
tions with a foreign culture.

Furthermore, 
it 
otherizes 

Asians, exaggerating negative ste-
reotypes as its source of humor. 
A simpering, high-pitched pros-

titute begs Bob to “Lip my stock-
ings! Preas! Preas!,” and when he 
goes along with it out of amuse-
ment and derision, she rolls 
around on the floor kicking her 
feet up absurdly, “Don’t touch 
me! Hep preas! No! No!” It’s the 
peak of the hypersexualized, 
submissive and morally strange 
Asian woman stereotype. Mur-
ray constantly mocks the Japa-
nese for their accented English 
by repeating them the “right” 
way and questioning his Japanese 
director’s vision as if it’s stupid just 
because of the way he conveys it. 
The Japanese are portrayed as 
flat, hollow characters with no 
thoughts of their own, as if they’re 
just there for the white people to 
laugh at. We don’t laugh because 
we are confused, or because we 
are embarrassed at our own sense 
of 
cultural 
misunderstanding. 

We laugh because all these Asian 
people are just so weird. All these 
stereotypes are true, but are pur-
posely exploited for cheap jokes, 
like an elevator scene where Bob 
towers at least a foot over a horde 
of tiny Asian men while in other 
scenes, there are clearly Asian 
actors his height.

Even the aspects of Japanese 

culture that are portrayed posi-
tively are done through a ste-
reotypical lens. The first time 
Charlotte 
genuinely 
smiles, 

it’s observing monks chanting 
prayers in a Buddhist temple, 
approaching women in kimonos 
arranging flowers while tender, 
serene background music drifts 
quietly in the background. Japa-
nese culture is only used for the 
white protagonist to find herself, 
and even the speaker introducing 
her to Buddhism is another white 
woman, not a Japanese person 
who carries that history.

“I know I’m not racist,” director 

Sofia Coppola insisted in an inter-

view with the Independent, and I 
believe it. People may say that I’m 
being too sensitive, too politically 
correct. After all, 60 years ago, 
Katherine Hepburn was prancing 
around in yellowface for “Dragon 
Seed.” I get that the point of the 
film is to show how alienating it is 
to be alone in a different world, to 
feel like no one understands you. I 
get that all of these characters are 
flawed. They project their own 
insecurities onto their surround-
ings, so we shouldn’t take their 
opinion as fact. The one-dimen-
sionality of the Japanese charac-
ters, portraying the mundane as 
different — I understand the value, 
even the necessity, of these artistic 
decisions.

This is where things get a little 

muddy. Having grown up in the 
West, even I view some of the 
same things the film mentioned 
as something weird, or different 
from what I’m used to. So these 
feelings are perfectly valid, and 
pointing out these differences is 
how Coppola gets us to connect 
with her characters. But empha-
sizing the difference taps into our 
base instincts of xenophobia — 
encouraging the intended Western 
audience to draw on that point of 
twisted personal empathy in order 
to propel the film forward.

I really wish this film could 

have succeeded in another uni-
verse. It might have felt a little less 
exploitative if a white girl from a 
privileged family hadn’t directed 
it. Maybe it would have worked 
well if an Asian had portrayed the 
same feeling of isolation in Amer-
ica. But because there are so few 
films featuring Asians, the rare 
ones that do must work to undo 
centuries of stereotyping. Unfor-
tunately, the thematic premise 
of “Lost in Translation” makes it 
inherently impossible to maintain 
sensitivity.

Stronger ‘Carter’ 

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

“Agent Carter” had a strong first 

season. The premiere and finale 
were solid, and 
the overall story 
was intelligently 
crafted and skill-
fully 
executed. 

The second sea-
son’s 
premiere, 

“The Lady in the 
Lake,” 
carries 

over all the com-
pelling elements 
of the first, while 
also establishing 
some new, even 
stronger 
story-

lines.

In its beginning season, Peggy 

Carter (Hayley Atwell, “Captain 
America: The First Avenger”) had 
to struggle with overt and covert 
sexist behavior from her superiors 
and co-workers, constantly need-
ing to prove that she was just as 
capable as the men. In the first few 
minutes of the premiere, we see the 
men’s shifted perspective. Her cur-
rent chief, Jack Thompson (Chad 
Michael Murray, “One Tree Hill”), 
trusts her to begin the interroga-
tion of Dottie (Bridget Regan, “Jane 
the Virgin”) as others watch from 
behind a mirror, commenting on 
how impressed they are with her 
technique. When Thompson sends 
Peggy to Los Angeles per Daniel 
Sousa’s (Enver Gjokaj, “Dollhouse”) 
request for a talented agent, Mur-
ray and Atwell convey that the ten-
sion between them isn’t predicated 

upon a lack of respect — but rather a 
desire on Thompson’s part to move 
ahead in his career.

When Carter arrives in Cali-

fornia, there is some uneasiness 
between Sousa, now the chief of 
the S.S.R.’s West Coast branch, 
and Peggy, but the romantic sub-
plot exposition doesn’t derail from 
the actual plot — solving a strange 
murder case involving a woman’s 
body encased in a block of frozen 
lake water.

Edwin Jarvis (James D’Arcy, 

“Broadchurch”), Peggy’s ally from 
the first season, introduces her to 
his wife, who is a little too wide-
eyed to seem real. It’s the only 
scene in the episode that feels 
forced, but Mrs. Jarvis (Lotte Ver-
beek, “The Fault in Our Stars”) 
makes up for the awkwardness 
when she gives Peggy the kind of 
present every woman truly wants 
— a garter that also functions as a 
holster.

A new villain, Whitney Frost 

(Wynn Everett, “The Newsroom”) 
is introduced, ill will simmering 
under the polite conversations 
she holds with other characters, 
and there’s also a new romantic 
interest for Peggy, Dr. Jason Wil-
kes (Reggie Austin, “The Omen”), 
who may or may not be in cahoots 
with Frost. With the inclusion of 
Wilkes’s character, the writing of 
the premiere sets up conversations 
about the racial discrimination of 
the time period. Wilkes and Carter 
have an understanding look in their 
eyes when they speak to one anoth-
er; their chemistry feels natural.

As always in “Agent Carter,” the 

dialogue is organic, and the actors 
deliver it well. There’s even a cute 
nod to today’s popular jargon — 
when Jarvis is injured, and Peggy 
reassures him that he’ll live, he 
replies crossly, “Of course I’ll live. 
I’m worried about the aesthetic.”

The elegance of the shots of 

1940s New York in the first season 
is echoed in the second season’s 
glamorous shots of Old Hollywood, 
in setting, costuming and makeup. 
Subtly chic details, like the color 
of Peggy’s sunglasses matching 
her lipstick, create an aesthetically 
rich viewing experience. The first 
shot of “The Lady in the Lake”— a 
perky red hat bobbing along in a sea 
of grey suits — is beautifully framed 
and reminiscent of the contrasts 
between Peggy and her male co-
workers in the first season, but the 
differences of the power structures 
this season are emphasized when it 
is revealed that the red hat belongs 
to Dottie, not Peggy.

The beauty of “Agent Carter” 

never detracts from the story, nor 
from the themes that organically 
arise from it. Neither Carter nor the 
female antagonists are weaker for 
their femininity, nor do they apolo-
gize for it. Peggy Carter and co. are 
continuing a conversation that they 
helped start with the first season, 
which was followed by the likes of 
“Supergirl” and more recently (and 
successfully) “Jessica Jones” about 
whether there’s space and/or inter-
est for female superheros.

Peggy might not have powers, 

but she doesn’t need them. As she 
proves over and over, she can still 
kick anyone’s ass.

MUSIC INTERVIEW

Exclusive interview 
with Protomartyr

By REGAN DETWILER

Daily Arts Writer

Detroit-based Protomartyr, 

a post-punk foursome with a 
sound that’s mellow yet explor-
ative, but still angry, released 
in October The Agent Intel-
lect, their third and without a 
doubt their best, album in four 
years. Frontman Joe Casey, 
guitarist Greg Ahee, drum-
mer Alex Leonard and bassist 
Scott Davidson are alumni of 
the University of Detroit Jesuit 
High School and Academy, and 
who have been playing local 
gigs for years. The funny thing 
is, Casey is a whole 10 years 
older than the others.

With their upcoming tour 

including a stop at the Blind 
Pig on Jan. 29, I had a chance 
to sit down for a chat with the 
group’s 
dark-humored 
and 

semi-fatalistic front man and 
talk about the tour, the albums 
and the emotions thus far. 

TMD: I know you guys 

have had three albums in 
four years, which is very 
impressive. What were some 
of the driving forces behind 
this latest release?

JC: Well, we wanted to kind 

of keep recording as fast as 
we could. We had a bunch of 
songs ready to go, so our sec-
ond album pretty much started 
with our new stuff right away. 
We tried to keep working as 
much as we could ... We decid-
ed to go back, for this record, 
back to the same studio. We felt 
like we wanted to record in the 
same studio just to see what it 
would be like to go back to a 
place where we now feel com-
fortable, whereas the first time 
we were kind of like in awe of 
being in a studio for three days 
... it was amazing, whereas the 
first record, we recorded in 
a day. Now we have a whole 
week! We really wanted to kind 
of use the studio as much as 
possible.

TMD: It really seems like 

you guys are just constantly 
creating music. How can you 
describe your creative pro-
cess, if you want to use that 
terminology?

JC: Laughs. I don’t! You 

know, it’s unfortunate because 
we work pretty hard ... We’re 
about to go out on this tour 
where we’re gonna be gone 
until the end of July. That’s the 
first time that’s ever happened. 
And I don’t think we’re neces-
sarily a band who can come up 
with new stuff on the road. You 
hear stories about somebody 
recording something in a hotel 
room or something but ... we’re 
still a band who can’t stay in a 
hotel room — we have to sleep 
on some floors. So yeah, I don’t 
know how people can record on 
the road. I don’t think there’ll 
be another album coming out 
this year.

TMD: So what is this 

urgency 
behind 
creating? 

Why the four albums in three 
years?

JC: Well, I feel like there are 

two drastic extremes for put-
ting music out: one is to spend 
a long time working on it, like 
three or four years, and anoth-
er is to record it really fast 
and put it up online. I like to 
think we’re somewhere in the 
middle. Putting out an album, 
especially 
nowadays 
where 

you can just throw it up online, 
you can come up with an idea 
and record it and put it online. 
So there are people that have 
released a lot more stuff than 
we have, but I think we’re actu-
ally somewhere in the middle 

where we take a little bit of 
time, work on it, and then we 
move on to the next thing. And 
we do put in a lot of work and 
effort, especially into the last 
two records ... but then after a 
while you just kind of have to 
let it go. And also, a band itself 
... most bands don’t last more 
than five years. On average, 
some bands only last a couple 
weeks. You know, you can’t 
find a drummer or something. 
There are few bands who have 
that creative spark.

TMD: Definitely, definite-

ly. A little fatalistic.

JC: Laughs.

TMD: Going off of what 

you were saying about that 
perfect piece, I think what 
fans love about what Pro-
tomartyr has done is that it 
does have that kind of raw 
feel. Now we have so much 
music that’s recorded and 
then edited, so you end up 
with that perfect product at 
the end. But I think people 
like that raw sound that you 
guys have. Some people have 
even described you as giving 
this kind of musical realism. 
Comments?

JC: Well, you know, you can 

live in a world where you lis-
ten to very smooth, perfectly 
constructed music and enjoy 
it. If you think music is kind of 
like visual art, some very raw 
things are still considered art. 
There are some things that are 
sculpted out of marble and took 
decades to make. And a world 
can exist where both of those 
things are going on. There’s a 
book that just came out about 
the Swedes or whatever who 
make pretty much every hit 
song that all have the same 
things in them. There’s really 
only one or two people writing 
the Top 40. That happens and 
people get sick of it. They want 
something raw. I don’t know if 
we’re very musical-realistic but 
you know ... we want to sound 
better but I guess we sound as 
good as we are. Laughs. The 
band is getting better but we 
play at our level.

TMD: 
No, 
you 
guys 

sound great. It’s a realistic 
response.

JC: Laughs.

TMD: People are describ-

ing Agent Intellect as your 
best work. Do you think this 
album is a departure from 
what you’ve done in the past?

JC: No, I’d call it a continua-

tion. And, you know, it’s always 
a good sign when people tell 
you it’s the best. What’s inter-
esting is understanding that 
people respond. I’m not going 
to say, ‘Oh, I can take that bad 
review’ because I can’t. You’re 
responding to it. So it’s good 
to see people are thinking 
that we’re developing or get-
ting better or changing. That’s 
good.

Behind the mask

Freshman guard’s 

protective gear 
dates back to 
high school

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

Sunday, 
in 
the 
Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
team’s 

matchup 
against 
Nebraska, 

freshman 
guard 
Boogie 

Brozoski entered the game with 
5:10 left in the first quarter. 
Multiple players on the floor 
were 
sporting 
headbands, 

but Brozoski’s headwear was 
different.

She was wearing a clear, 

plastic mask. It was her first time 
donning 
the 
face-protecting 

accessory as a Wolverine, but 
Brozoski has worn it in the past.

During her high school days 

in New York, Brozoski broke her 
nose twice. Injuries are nothing 
new to her — she also fractured 
her hip in eighth grade. 

But despite the two nose 

injuries, she never missed a game 
in high school. Brozoski was able 
to play through the injury and 
after-effects of the pain because 
of the mask. Playing with it on 
wasn’t simple, though, and she 
had to get used to it.

“I had to get used to sweating 

a lot, keeping it on when it’s 
sweaty, and taking it off really 
quick and wiping it off,” Brozoski 
said. “Visibility was something I 
had to get used to as well, but it 
was a smooth adjustment (this 
week).”

In practice Friday, Brozoski 

was hit in the face by as 
inadvertent elbow. She describes 
her current injury to her nose as 
a small fracture, and she chose 
to wear the mask for protection 
from further injury on the court.

Her mother had the mask she 

wore in high school shipped to 
Ann Arbor in time for Sunday’s 
contest. Though the mask is 
the same, Brozoski has no 
sentimental 
value 
attached 

to it. By this point, she’s used 
to playing with it on, and the 
routine that comes with it, but 
she would rather play with no 
obstructions to her comfort or 
visibility.

Some 
well-known 
NBA 

players 
have 
sported 
many 

different styles of the mask 
after facial injuries. Long time 
Pistons shooting guard Richard 
Hamilton 
wore 
one 
after 

breaking his nose in Detroit’s 
2003-04 championship season. 
And even after Hamilton’s nose 
healed, he wore the mask until 
he retired nine seasons later. 
Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul and 
many other players have had to 
wear it for shorter time spans. 
LeBron James even wore a black, 
carbon-fiber one, different than 
the more common clear one 
Brozoski wears.

Brozoski has no plans to wear 

the mask after her nose heals, but 
she found the transition to wear 
it for the meantime easy because 
of her previous experiences 
playing with the mask on.

“I don’t really like it that 

much,” Brozoski said. “But if I 
have to wear it for protection, I 
will. It’s not something I would 
prefer to wear.”

In Sunday’s contest, Brozoski 

recorded five points, an assist 
and two steals — not far off 
from her season averages of 6.4 
points, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals — 
proving the mask doesn’t affect 
her play too much. No matter 
how long she has to wear the 
mask, Brozoski will continue 
her role as a budding backup 
freshman point guard.

And if Brozoski’s past is proof, 

it shouldn’t slow her down.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Behind enemy lines: Eddie Jordan

Rutgers coach 
talks recruiting, 
transitioning to 

the Big Ten

By LEV FACHER 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s basketball 

team plays host Wednesday to 
Rutgers, 
a 

program 
that, 
in 

its 
second 

season 
in 

the 
Big 

Ten, is still 
struggling 
to gain traction in its new 
conference. The Scarlet Knights 
won just two Big Ten games last 
season and are currently 0-7 
in the league. Rutgers’ roster 
rebuild is very much a work in 
progress, making the Wolverines 
heavy favorites in the teams’ only 
meeting of the year.

The Michigan Daily sat down 

with Scarlet Knights coach Eddie 
Jordan — formerly the head 
coach of the NBA’s Sacramento 
Kings, Washington Wizards and 
Philadelphia 76ers — at Big Ten 
Media Day in October to talk 
about the difficulties of breaking 
into the Big Ten and Rutgers’ 
recruiting philosophy within the 
geography of its new conference.

The Michigan Daily: How 

tough has it been seeing so little 
success in your first two years 
as a Big Ten team and how has it 
affected your recruiting outlook?

Eddie Jordan: I was taught 

(that) you either sell winning 
or you sell hope. If you aren’t 
winning, have a future in front 
of you. Develop your future. And 
we’ve got a great future. Our kids 
are great kids. They work hard. 
Our talent base is much better, 
although they’re young. In a 
three-hour practice, we don’t fall 
off so much, and we have eight 

guys who could possibly start. I 
just think that it keeps everybody 
excited. You’ve got to deal with 
their mistakes as the season goes 
along. As I’ve said before, in June, 
July and August, everybody says, 
‘We’re young, let’s take some 
time.’ In December and January, 
when they’re making youthful 
mistakes, people are saying, 
‘What the heck’s going on, 
Coach?’ You have to expect that. 
You have to have some patience.

TMD: Is it tough, cyclically, to 

lose so many scholarship players 
as you continue to try to break 
into the conference? Does it 
feel like you need to take a step 
back before you can take a step 
forward?

EJ: Well, I don’t want to take a 

step back. We had two wins in the 
conference last year, and I would 
love to be more successful in 
the conference. We’re just going 
to have to rely on some of our 
youthfulness to maybe surprise 
some people and stay in games 
and be exciting. But you know 
what? Our talent is good, our 
talent base is good. But one thing 
I’ve learned over the years is that 

talent just doesn’t win itself. You 
have to have experience along 
with talent, you’ve got to have 
toughness along with the talent, 
you’ve got to have good kids with 
good character. Toughness alone 
doesn’t win. Experience alone 
doesn’t win. Talent always has 
to be involved, along with the 
previous two.

TMD: Some coaches might 

try to take advantage of the new 
geographical 
footprint 
when 

their team switches conferences. 
If and when you find yourself 
in Iowa or Michigan, are there 
selling points for the Rutgers 
brand that might lure an athlete 
from a Midwestern area?

EJ: 
Well, 
we 
don’t 
go 

to 
Iowa 
and 
Michigan 
to 

recruit. 
What 
happens 
in 

recruiting is, with all the AAU 
tournaments, everything is in 
Vegas. Everything is in Florida. 
Everything is in Texas or New 
York or California, wherever. So 
if there’s a kid who’s on an Illinois 
AAU team, we’ll obviously make 
some contact if he has interest. 
But look — our hotbed is New 
York through northern Virginia, 

and we’ve recently gone to 
Florida and Carolina, because my 
assistants are really good in those 
areas. So our top kids are from 
Carolina and Florida. Although 
we want to recruit New Jersey as 
hard as any other place, it’s just 
that’s the way life is.

TMD: So the intent, long-

term, isn’t necessarily to compete 
in Indiana for recruits with 
offers, for example, from Indiana 
and Purdue?

EJ: I wouldn’t say that, not 

necessarily. We want to go after 
the best kids — that’s number 
one. Number two is (we want to 
go after) the best kids that we 
have a chance at getting. We’re 
not going after the best kids 
when we know they’ll go to a 
top-10 program. Corey Sanders 
(a freshman from Lakeland, Fla.) 
has been one of our highly rated 
recruits, and we had a connection 
there, we recruited him hard, he 
had great interest in me being an 
ex-NBA coach. So again, you’ve 
got to connect the dots that will 
help you form the picture of what 
this kid is about, and do you have 
a chance?

Rutgers coach Eddie Jordan used to coach the NBA’s Sacramento Kings, Washington Wizards and Philadelphia 76ers.

matic weapon. Buttons for sale 
displayed sayings like, “Jail Hill-
ary” and “BOMB the SHIT out of 
ISIS.” Another button trumpeted 
Thomas Jefferson, George Wash-
ington and Andrew Jackson as 
“the original right wing extrem-
ists.”

When Trump told the coun-

try in June he planned to run for 
president, a number of pundits 
deemed his candidacy a grab for 
the spotlight. And with rheto-
ric as brash and controversial as 
Trump’s has been, he certainly 
got it. But now, as he leads the 
polls in Iowa amid a crowded 
field of Republican candidates, it’s 
clear not only that Trump is play-
ing to win but that for many, the 
message he has spent the last six 
months peddling has resonated 
in a huge way. Trump has consis-
tently painted himself as the only 
candidate willing to say what oth-
ers will not — the only person with 
the business acumen and, more 
importantly, the balls to take on 
everything a sizable chunk of 
voters find scary — immigrants, 
radical Islamic terrorism, China, 
Iran, you name it.

A handful of protesters on 

Muscatine High’s front lawn 
were trying to counter that nar-
rative when I arrived. They, too, 
held signs. “Donald’s economy 
is no good for working Iowans,” 
one read. Another: “Love Trumps 
Hate.” When cars drove by on 
their way to the parking area, 
the group chanted, “What do we 
want? No hate. When do we want 
it? Now.” A five-year-old girl in a 
Hello Kitty hat and pink gloves 
held a “Dump Trump” sign, 
clearly written in her own shaky 
script. Two cars on the way to the 
rally slowed long enough to roll 
down their windows and bran-
dish middle fingers.

Others, clearly not Trump sup-

porters but apparently interested 
in seeing the Trump show for 
themselves, obliged a sign asking 
rally-goers to honk if they con-
demned the candidate’s rhetoric. 
On the way in, another woman 
told me she wasn’t a supporter, 
but wanted to see the guy in per-
son.

Jean Clark, a retired teacher 

who taught for 30 years at Musca-
tine High, was on the lawn with a 
“Fear + Hate = Trump” sign. She 
said Trump’s language would not 

have been tolerated in her class-
room, let alone in a presidential 
campaign.

“We want a president that our 

students and our young can chil-
dren can look up to, and I don’t 
think this is it,” she said. “I think 
people oftentimes do vote their 
fears, and that’s why people vote 
for extremes, but I think my mes-
sage would be that this kind of 
fear, intolerance, hatred really 
isn’t acceptable and it doesn’t rep-
resent our country.”

Inside 
the 
school’s 
yellow 

gymnasium, where a crowd of 
about 1,000 people stood bunched 
around a stage set up below a 
large “Muskies” logo painted on 
the wall, I wandered around the 
gym floor with the aim of asking 
supporters why exactly they’re in 
Trump’s camp. Some told me they 
were only leaning toward Trump, 
while others, like Judith Knut-
hson and Rod Treimer, said they 
were committed to caucusing for 
Trump. Knuthson, a 72-year-old 
who owns a real estate business in 
Muscatine, explained it this way: 
“I think he is the only one that can 
save the country at this moment.”

Treimer had just met Knuth-

son a few minutes before and was 
chatting with her about Trump 
when I interrupted.

“He is big on everything,” Tre-

imer told me. “He says it like it is. 
I believe in the borders. I believe 
in the security. I don’t believe in 
lying to people. I’d rather have 
him say something bluntly and 
that’s the way it is, not lie. I don’t 
want him to be two-faced. I think 
Obama has done a terrible, ter-
rible job.”

Knuthson agreed with that 

assessment, noting she has been 
forced to work 72-hour weeks 
to make ends meet. I asked her 
which of the president’s policies 
have posed the greatest chal-
lenges for her business. She told 
me I shouldn’t really be asking 
her that. However, she did agree 
that Trump’s business experience 
could not be matched by anyone 
else in the Republican field.

For Treimer, a corn farmer who 

told me I probably eat his corn if I 
eat Cap’n Crunch cereal, national 
security was his biggest priority, 
especially in light of ISIS’s rise 
and what he deemed a bad Obama 
administration deal with Iran. So 
I asked: Why Trump, the guy with 
virtually no traditional back-
ground in foreign affairs?

“He’s got so much security and 

national background,” Treimer 

told me, raising his voice slightly 
and speaking more quickly. “Look 
at all his businesses. He has to 
have security in all his buildings 
he’s built, he oversees business he 
does, the contacts he’s got, he has 
more than all the other politicians 
together. He knows more people, 
he knows how business works 
in the world, world economics, 
everything about the monetary, 
on the Wall Street, how they 
manipulate the currencies across 
the world.”

Derek Wolfe, a columnist for 

The Michigan Daily who accom-
panied me to Iowa, asked about 
Trump’s stance on immigration. 
Did they support his proposal to 
ban the entry of all Muslims into 
the United States? Treimer said 
he would go further.

“Our founding fathers got 

separation of church and state 
because they knew how Islam 
religion would not work in this 
country,” he said, as Journey’s 
“Don’t Stop Believin’ ” played in 
the background. “That’s why we 
have separation of church and 
state as much as we can possibly 
get it. Anyone who says they want 
Islam in the United States, they 
need to get out.”

Both Knuthson and Treimer 

said they plan to caucus on Mon-
day. Treimer said his goal is to 
get as many supporters of U.S. 
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who is 
currently polling second in Iowa, 
to switch over to Trump. That’s 
because in a caucus, part of the 
process entails supporters trying 
to convert caucus-goers to their 
camp before the official numbers 
are tallied.

“I had never been to a caucus,” 

Knuthson told me. “I vote, but I 
have never been to a caucus, and 
I would never dream of not going 
to that caucus (this year). I would 
never vote for any candidate 
beside Trump, and if he doesn’t 
make it, I will write his name in. 
He is the only one that can pull us 
out of this mess.”

When Donald Trump took the 

stage, he told the crowd he had 
just come from church. The ser-
mon, he said, focused on humility.

“I don’t know if that was aimed 

at me — perhaps — but the church 
I don’t think knew I was coming, 
so maybe it was just by luck,” he 
said. 

The crowd loved it.
Trump 
wasted 
little 
time 

before ticking off his poll num-
bers. According to an aggregate 
from Real Clear Politics, Trump 

is leading Cruz, widely seen as the 
anti-establishment alternative to 
Trump, by 16.9 points nationally 
and 5.7 points in Iowa. Trump and 
Cruz have ramped up the inten-
sity of their attacks against one 
another in the last week as both 
try to secure a first-place finish in 
Iowa. Over the weekend, U.S. Sen. 
Marco Rubio (R-FL), currently 
polling in third place in Iowa and 
vying for the state’s compara-
tively moderate Republican vot-
ers, secured the endorsement of 
the Des Moines Register. Trump 
has not shied away from sparring 
directly with the opposition, and 
spent much of the early portion of 
his stump bashing other contend-
ers — both Democrat and Repub-
lican.

“We’ll talk about individual 

candidates for a while,” Trump 
began. “Should we do that?”

The crowd responded with 

cheers.

“I thought so.”
Trump started in. He hit U.S. 

Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), the 
Democratic candidate who has 
also tapped into populist fervor 
and is consistently hammering 
a message centered on the eco-
nomics of income and wealth 
inequality. Trump said his attacks 
on Democratic frontrunner Hill-
ary Clinton, who by the way, as 
Trump told the crowd, might be 
in jail by the time she takes office, 
were solely responsible for Sand-
er’s surge in the polls.

“This guy Bernie Sanders, give 

me a break, how does he figure 
into this whole thing?” he said, 
adding that the Vermont senator 
is probably a communist. “I could 
hit him so hard, he’s too easy, he’s 
really too easy.”

The insults kept rolling from 

there: former Florida Gov. Jeb 
Bush (“It’s time to give up, Jeb.”), 
Cruz (“He has no principles.”) 
and Obama (“Just a bad guy.”) all 
received their share of the Trump 
treatment. As he finished the 
introductory takedowns, which 
as it turns out, never really end 
in a Trump speech, he began to 
roll out a vision for America that 
largely relied on projecting his 
own strength in making deals and 
standing up for the country in the 
face of China, Mexico and even 
fiscally-related interests like big 
oil. He told the crowd he would be 
“the greatest jobs president God 
ever created” and that he is “the 
most militaristic person.” At one 
point, he explained that his pre-
vious interactions with Chinese 

firms provide proof of his apti-
tude for winning.

“I do great with China,” he 

said. “Where I win, I win, that’s 
how I got them. I beat China.”

At this point, chants of “We 

love Trump” roared through the 
gym.

“We’ve got to have wins,” 

Trump said. “We got to have 
wins. Our country doesn’t win 
anymore.”

Trump kept emphasizing that 

he would help the country win 
again, particularly in the context 
of the only concrete policy pro-
posal he presented during the 
course of his speech: approving 
the Keystone oil pipeline.

“I want 25 percent of the deal 

for the United States,” he said. 
“When they do this pipeline, it’s 
going to be a very profitable thing 
… I want the developers of the 
pipeline to give the United States 
a big, big chunk of the profits or 
even ownership rights like I do in 
business. That’s what I do. That’s 
what I do … They will give us a 
lot… I don’t want to be too greedy, 
but if I’m greedy, I’m greedy for 
the country. I want to be greedy 
for the country. I want a piece 
of the deal? Doesn’t that make 
sense?”

And to the crowd gathered 

here in Muscatine, it totally did. 
Sometime after a Sikh protester 
wearing a red turban and unfold-
ing a cloth “Stop Hate” banner 
was escorted out by security 
staff and the wild applause of the 
gymnasium, he lamented what he 
said were the media’s continued 
efforts to downplay the size of his 
rallies.

At one point, he told the thou-

sand or more people gathered in 
the gym to turn toward the “slea-
zebags” in the media risers as he 
explained the press would likely 
misrepresent the one empty por-
tion of the bleachers closed for 
safety concerns as evidence that 
the rally was really not that wide-
ly attended.

“What sleaze, what sleaze, 

they’re disgusting,” he said.

In doing so, Trump was driv-

ing home a message articulated 
by Jeff Kaufmann, the Iowa 
Republican Party chair, when he 
introduced Trump at the begin-
ning of the event. And it’s a mes-
sage that’s been internalized by so 
many of the people who had come 
to see Trump in Muscatine. Every 
day, Kaufmann said he wakes up 
to headlines trumpeting civil war 
in the Republican Party. That’s 

not so, he told the crowd.

“We’re 
having 
a 
vigorous 

debate because the last eight 
years has made us mad, made us 
angry,” he said, voice cracking as 
he spoke, talking about his short 
meeting with Trump prior to the 
event. “Most of our conversa-
tion was about how to give voices 
again to the people that don’t 
believe they have a voice. I can’t 
think of anything more Republi-
can than that.”

Campaign 
observers 
say 

Trump has capitalized on some 
of the same kind of feelings that 
Bernie Sanders has tapped into 
— frustration with the political 
system, a desire for political revo-
lution.

“I’m angry and the American 

people are angry,” Sanders said at 
a Saturday rally in Clinton, about 
an hour away. “What Trump is 
doing with the anger he sees, is 
he is using it to scapegoat minori-
ties. What he is doing is trying 
to divide us up. And what we 
are saying, which is profoundly 
different, is that when we stand 
together as a people, Black and 
Latino 
and 
Asian 
American, 

when we stand together, gay and 
straight, male and female, people 
born in this country and people 
who have come from another 
country, when we stand together 
there is nothing that we cannot 
accomplish.”

“This is a movement folks,” 

Trump said on Sunday. “This 
is not like a normal situation. 
There’s never been anything like 
this. They’re going to study it … 
Our country is divided, and it’s 
divided very badly. And we have 
to bring it back. And if we don’t 
bring it back, we’re going to have 
a problem. But we’re going to 
bring it back. I’m going to bring 
it back.”

As Trump shook hands and 

posed for pictures after the 
speech, I asked people still stand-
ing around in the gym what poli-
cies of Trump’s they supported. 
Most referred abstractly to his 
business experience or his will-
ingness to tell it like it is, his 
ability to keep the country safe 
or create new jobs, but very few 
could pinpoint a specific, tangible 
policy item.

I thought about what Knuth-

son told me earlier in the after-
noon when I asked her whether 
the people she knows are as angry 
and fearful as many pundits say.

“Oh they’re scared, period,” 

she said. “Everywhere.”

Wolverines prepare for winless Scarlet Knights

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

Wednesday, 
the 
Michigan 

men’s 
basketball 
team 
will 

play its second game against a 
winless Big Ten 
team, this time 
in the form of 
Rutgers. While 
the Wolverines 
(5-2 Big Ten, 
15-5 
overall) 

have 
played 

teams at both 
the 
top 
and 

bottom of the 
conference, 
they’ve 
had 

close 
games 

against 
teams 

from both ends 
of the spectrum: They hung in 
the game before falling to No. 3 
Iowa and, more recently, barely 
hung on to beat 0-8 Minnesota.

The Scarlet Knights (0-7, 6-14) 

will look to replicate the Golden 
Gophers’ scrappy play, seeking 
a better result. Michigan coach 
John Beilein, in typical fashion, 
said 
regardless 
of 
Rutgers’ 

undesirable record, the Scarlet 
Knights will still be a challenge 
for the Wolverines. 

“They may beat us,” Beilein 

said. “Our hope is that if they 
beat us, it’s only because they 
played great and we didn’t 
overlook 
anyone. 
That’s 
the 

message. Everyone’s a Division 
I player, everybody can run and 
dunk and (make a) 3-pointer and 
(with) foul trouble, anyone can 
win a game.”

The Scarlet Knights have 

played down to the wire against 
No. 17 Indiana, which has lost 
only one game in the Big Ten, 
but they don’t have very many 
other 
notable 
performances. 

Jan. 18, they were crushed by 
No. 21 Purdue, allowing the 
Boilermakers to score 107 points.

Guard Corey Sanders leads 

Rutgers with 14.1 points per game 
on 40.4 percent shooting, but the 
freshman is also averaging 3.5 

assists per game. Sanders has 
two teammates who also average 
double-digit scoring, guard Mike 
Williams and forward Deshawn 
Freeman. 

Rutgers has lost 22 straight 

games to Big Ten opponents, and 
it’s not likely that the streak will 
stop on Wednesday. 

Michigan should be able to 

catch its breath during its next 
two games against Rutgers and 
Penn State before it returns 
home for a two-game homestand 
against Indiana and No. 12 
Michigan State.
BEILEIN 
USES 
TWITTER 

FOR A CAUSE 

Beilein helped raise funds 

for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine 
Glioma research through the 
ChadTough Foundation, the rare 
form of pediatric brain cancer 
that Chad Carr passed away from 
in November.

Now, through ESPN’s Infiniti 

Coaches’ 
Charity 
Challenge, 

Beilein is raising money for the 
ChadTough Foundation again. 

“We had a great first round,” 

Beilein said. “I did a little video 
message today, however, that 
they don’t give trophies after the 
end of the first quarter. We have 
three more quarters to play here 
to be able to win this.

“I personally tweeted it today 

as well — I’m going to tweet it, I 
haven’t actually tweeted it yet. I 
haven’t hit the send button yet. 
I 
had 
never 

heard 
the 

letters 
DIPG 

before in my 
life, until about 
a year ago. … 
Every 
week 

I’m 
hearing 

more. 
It’s 

something that 
I really want to 
support.”

When 

asked about his Twitter usage 
further, the 62-year-old Beilein 
responded that he usually drafts 
his own tweets, albeit with 
some uneasiness thanks to his 

Catholic-school upbringing. 

“I do (tweet by myself) 

most of the time,” Beilein 
said. “Every now and then, 
(Associate Basketball Director 
Tom Wywrot) tries to do one 

and I end up 
redrafting 
it 

anyhow, 
so 

I 
just 
said, 

‘I’ll 
just 
do 

it by myself.’ 
But 
I 
don’t 

like doing it 
because 
I’m 

just 
worried 

about 
one 

grammatical 
error, 
which 

the nuns and priests would 
be mad at me for, 30, 40 years 
later, or I’m just going to say 
something stupid. I’ve gotta 
look it over and look it over and 

look it over. I wish I could be 
like some people and send out 
more.”
DONNAL GETS PUMPED

As most Michigan fans are 

aware, forward Mark Donnal 
has had a breakout junior season 
since Big Ten play began. 

Before 
his 
impressive 

performance against Illinois on 
Dec. 30, Donnal was averaging 
3.9 points and 2.1 boards per 
game. Now, the big man is 
shooting 57 percent and grabbing 
3.8 boards per game.

“If you look at (Donnal’s) 

offensive rebounding numbers 
right now, they’d be at the 
top of the league … in limited 
minutes,” Beilein said. “He is 
just working his tail off for the 
dirty rebounds, just for the ball 
that nobody else can get. He is 
controlling what he can control. 

I think he probably came in here 
thinking he was going to shoot a 
bunch of 3s, and that’s the way 
he was going to get on the court. 
Defense was just something you 
had to play. He likes playing 
defense and for a center, that is 
not an easy task.”

His teammates have seen a 

change in his play over the past 
year, so they aren’t surprised 
when they see him produce on 
the court.

But according to sophomore 

forward 
Aubrey 
Dawkins, 

they’re still taken aback when he 
diverges from his usual reserved 
self. 

“It catches me off guard when 

he does (get fired up),” Dawkins 
said. “He’s usually really calm 
and just quiet, but when he gets 
going, you’re like, ‘Oh, OK, let’s 
do this.’ ”

LEVERT ALERT

Senior guard Caris LeVert, 

who is a midseason Wooden 
Award finalist, has missed the 
last six games following an 
injury to his lower-left leg, but it 
appears that the end to his time 
on the sideline is near. Though 
he 
won’t 
play 
Wednesday 

against Rutgers, it wouldn’t be 
surprising to see him suit up as 
early as Saturday for Michigan’s 
matchup with Penn State at 
Madison Square Garden. 

“Caris has had more testing,” 

Beilein said. “Things continue to 
go in the right direction, but he 
is not ready to play yet. We hope 
he is very soon, but he’s moving 
in the right direction. … For the 
first time, we have a timeline that 
we’ve established. When you see 
him on the court, you’ll know 
what that timeline will look like.”

East Coast natives looking 
forward to New York game

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

The game itself has enough 

hype around it already.

The Michigan hockey team 

will battle the Nittany Lions for 
a crucial position in the Big Ten 
standings, as both teams are 
currently tied for second place 
in the conference.

But this weekend, the city 

that never sleeps will play host 
to Wolverines, adding even more 
of an aura around Michigan’s 
matchup. The Wolverines will 
complete their series against 
Penn State in Madison Square 
Garden for the Big Ten Super 
Saturday — an event in which 
the two schools’ basketball 
teams will also square off.

To add more drama to the 

contest, Penn State has been 
largely responsible for keeping 
the Wolverines out of the 
NCAA Tournament for the 
past two years. The Nittany 
Lions handed Michigan two 
ugly losses just before the Big 
Ten Tournament last year, 
knocking them out of the 
conference tournament in the 
first round with a 2-1 overtime 
win the year before that.

The stage can’t get much 

bigger, as the Wolverines will 
take the ice in one of the most 
historic arenas in sports.

But 
for 
a 
number 
of 

Michigan’s 
players, 
the 

opportunity will be a little 
more special.

“Some of the guys, it’ll be a 

good homecoming-type event 
for them, going back out east,” 
said 
junior 
forward 
Tyler 

Motte. “I’ve never been there. 
I know our class and the guys 
under us haven’t played in 
many events quite like this. 
It’s a new thing for the Big Ten 
as well, having the back-to-
back here with basketball and 
hockey, which I think will be 
good for the conference.

“I think it’ll be something 

that (the Big Ten will) be able 
to turn to in the next couple 
years — playing two sports in 

the same day. I think that’s 
something that really could 
separate the Big Ten from other 
conferences.”

Five Wolverines are among 

the group that will be returning 
home.

Senior 
forward 
Justin 

Selman — an Upper Saddle 
River, N.J., native — isn’t far off 
from the Empire State.

Senior 
goaltender 
Steve 

Racine is from Williamsville, 
N.Y., and spent the summer 
interning on Wall Street.

Freshman 
defenseman 

Joseph 
Cecconi 
calls 

Youngstown, N.Y., his home, 
and junior defenseman Kevin 
Lohan hails from Cold Spring 
Harbor on Long Island.

Though Lohan grew up a 

fan of the National Hockey 
League’s New York Islanders, 
he is still looking forward to 
playing in the Garden, which 
houses the Islanders’ chief 
rival, the New York Rangers.

Senior 
forward 
Cristoval 

‘Boo’ 
Nieves 
is 
from 

Baldwinsville, but the contest 
will hold even more weight 
given that he has been in the 
New York Rangers’ system 
since 
being 
selected 
59th 

overall in the 2012 draft.

Even Michigan coach Red 

Berenson has spent his fair 
share of time in the Big Apple, 
playing 
49 
games 
for 
the 

Rangers in 1966 and 1967.

But the Wolverines’ seasoned 

leader is more enthusiastic 
about 
the 
opportunity 
it 

provides his players. To him, 
it’s more important for the 
team to gain experience in 
rinks that foster environments 
similar to what they may face 
in the future, whether it be in 
the National Hockey League or 
NCAA Championship games.

“The game in New York will 

be important for (Selman and 
Nieves),” Berenson said. “But 
they had that when they were 
freshmen, too. When you have 
these games, you really need 
to take advantage of them. 
Hopefully, it really jumpstarts 

both of them. They’ve both 
played well, but I’d like to see 
this be like a coming-out game 
for them.”

The 
last 
time 
Michigan 

entered the Garden was Nov. 
24, 2012, when the Wolverines 
suffered a 5-1 dismantling at the 
hands of then-No. 13 Cornell.

The 
crowd 
favored 
the 

locally favorited Big Red that 
day, but that advantage may 
sway in Michigan’s favor this 
go around — at least according 
to the East Coast players.

“I think my parents ended up 

buying — on my mom’s side — 
almost like 50 tickets,” Selman 
said. “My family has a suite at 
(Madison Square Garden), so 
I think they filled that up, and 
then probably bought a couple 
more too, so it should be close 
to 100 people.”

Added Lohan: “There will be 

a lot of people — friends, family, 
family friends. It should be a 
good weekend.”

No one was willing to claim 

the title of team tour guide for 
the little, if any, downtime the 
Wolverines will get in the city, 
but Nieves suggested splitting 
the team into four between 
himself, Selman, Lohan and 
Racine.

Lohan echoed the sentiment, 

explaining that each New York 
native has their own go-to 
spots.

But Nieves couldn’t pinpoint 

the one place he would take his 
group if given the time.

“I can’t name one,” Nieves 

said. “There’s just too many 
good brunch and bagel places 
to name one.”

And on fitting the New York 

bagel snob stereotype: “Oh 
yeah, you have to be.”

So while Michigan will miss 

the Children of Yost during 
Thursday’s matchup in State 
College, the Wolverines may 
have a different fan section to 
fill the role Saturday.

And with a warm welcome 

expected, the Wolverines have 
a chance to make a statement 
against Penn State.

Boo Nieves will get to play in his home state of New York when Michigan plays at Madison Square Garden on Saturday.

A Filtered Life: How to Date the Cool Girl of Your 
Sad, Sad Dreams

T

here exists a male fantasy of the low-main-
tenance girlfriend — recently, she’s been 
known as the Cool Girl. She doesn’t need 

you to text her ever and never causes “drama” 
(AKA calling you out on your own bullshit). She 
also loves eating triple bacon cheeseburgers, while 
staying skinny and hot and giving you blow jobs. 
You can text her at 2 a.m. after smoking with your 
friends all night to hook up — and she’ll come 
over! Then you can ignore her for a week, or you 
can watch the game with her or some other boring 
activity she’ll purportedly enjoy. It doesn’t matter, 
she’s chill and cool with anything. She’s essential-
ly you and your friends but in the body of a really 
sexy girl.

Many recent think pieces have denounced and 

made fun of the idea of the Cool Girl — but even 
more advice columns by men and women alike have praised it. It’s been established 
that the Cool Girl trope forces women to mold their personalities and needs to what 
men want, but the idea of being universally attractive to men or having a girlfriend 
who requires literally no effort remains enticing. Herewith, a guide on how to find a 
Cool Girl:

1. Identify what you want in your low-maintenance relationship. Have you ever 

found yourself saying you “hate girls” or find them “too complicated?” Sick of having 
to listen and empathize with women? Unsure of how to make a girl orgasm? You might 
be a good candidate for dating a Cool Girl. Low-maintenance is a great idea for cars, 
pets and apartments. And now, you want to stretch the concept to humans. Excellent! 
Trolling Skeeps for women is getting exhausting. You want female company that’s a 
little more constant and predictable, but you also don’t want someone who, like, chal-
lenges your opinions or calls you out on being an ass. 

2. Now, let’s find her. There are several variations of this girl whose existence is 

solely for your benefit, and thus a few different places you might find her. Luckily, 
she has all of your exact interests so you don’t really have to go somewhere new or 
change your behavior at all to meet her. Maybe you like the one who eats wings with 
you while watching the game — she’s at Charley’s or Blue Lep. Maybe you like the one 
who doesn’t wear makeup and hikes and frolics in the mud, but still manages to be a 
beautiful fairy. Try the Arb. The bottom line is, this girl is “not like all the other girls” 
(even though girls are awesome and it’s just you who sucks).

3. Approach her. She’s ~chill~ so she doesn’t need a major conversation starter. Try 

coughing on her. And, unlike those other fucking teases, she sees what a nice guy you 
are and the most basic polite gesture really makes her swoon. Buy her a $1 well drink 
at Rick’s, and you’re in. If only all girls saw what a generous person you are. 

4. Your first date: coffee is fine. You obviously don’t have to pay for her, despite the 

fact that you asked her out. And, wow, she doesn’t even get one of those girly frappucci-
nos! Having sugar in your caffeinated beverage is such a disgustingly female trait, but 
she’s a Cool Girl and manages to contort her behavior to act masculine in every way. 
Or she drinks beer. Or burgers! She’ll eat burgers! Nothing worse than a girl who eats 
a salad. (Somehow she looks like she only eats salad though. You do not want someone 
who looks like you, who lives off Jimmy John’s glopped with mayonnaise and bar-
becue chips. Also, just saying, her internal organs are not going to be chill in a few 
decades if she really never eats vegetables.)

5. Wow, that was easy! You’re dating now, or whatever. Get ready for months of … 

doing exactly what you were doing anyways, but with a female and with more sex. Eat-
ing pizza, with a female. Talking about poop, but with a female. Sex is so easy and fun 
too. She likes everything you like! She never needs to orgasm! She loves giving head! 
You love when your sexual partners reaffirm everything you watched in porn! She 
never causes fights or seems upset about anything, ever. She doesn’t care about the 
relationship’s label or anything because she’s so low-key. This is great, because you 
really just want a woman who has a sack of rice in lieu of a brain. 

I hope this helped you in your low-maintenance girl endeavors. If you cannot find a 

girl who meets your criteria, try your male friend (who also does not wear makeup and 
consumes pizza) or your left hand.

“My favorite book would probably be 1984 by George 
Orwell. I like it because although it is fiction, it shows 
us the harsh realities that we deal with every day with 
“Big Brother.” It exemplifies our government in a very 
enticing way that is both interesting and terrifying.”

THE statement

The summer before my senior year of high school, I began intern-

ing at a local newspaper. In addition to making copies and transcrib-
ing interviews, I spent much of my time proofreading and formatting 
pages and pages of obituaries.

Common reactions to my position would include: “Why would you 

willingly do that, Lara?” or “I would get too depressed!”

And I did at first. But aside from my willingness to endure anything 

that took me one step closer to my dreams of becoming a professional 
journalist, I eventually told people the job was growing on me.

And it was.
Over time, the sometimes morbid and monotonous task became an 

opportunity to sift through war stories, academic and professional 
paths, passions and activist causes. I learned about the many lives 
people touched and the impacts they left behind. I remember telling 
myself that summer that I would one day write an obituary for some-
one who left an immeasurable impact on my own life.

Now seems like the right time.
For Aunt Paula:
I’ve always worried too much. My best friends nicknamed me “mom” 

sometime between seventh and eighth grade for my general tendency 
to overthink things, and as I grew older, my worries took the form of 
grade anxiety. I became the second semester senior in high school 
who couldn’t stop thinking about an exam until after I’d received my 
grade because what if I failed, and what if Michigan post-rejected me?

Anyone who shares similar stress knows that a decent amount of 

worry stems from the inability to accept stress itself. Is it normal for 
me to worry this much? Am I worrying about this enough? And so on.

One day when I was 11 or 12, my mom asked me: “Do you know who 

worries as much as you? Your Aunt Paula.”

She had no idea at the time just how much that comment would 

affect me, but it really did. It was as if knowing that someone I had 
always looked up to shared similar challenges somehow made my own 
anxiety acceptable.

Aunt Paula, my mom’s older sister, lost an eight-year battle with 

breast cancer at the age of 51 in 2013. The end of her life broke my 
family in so many ways it’s hard to put into words, so I won’t attempt 
to do that here. I will instead try to capture her genuine beauty and 
strength as best I can. 

Aunt Paula was a fast-talking, analytical perfectionist whose elec-

tric smile brightened any room — or mood — I was in.

She attended New York City Public Schools’ hyper-competitive 

Stuyvesant High School before graduating near the top of her class at 
the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. After

Zooming In: For Aunt Paula

earning her MBA from Columbia, she led a long and successful career in banking 
and software development.

But Aunt Paula was so much more to me than an inspiration; she was a mix 

between my second mother, my best friend and my guidance counselor. When girls 
were mean and boys were weird, Aunt Paula would relate, sympathize and encour-
age me to push through the awkward years. She took me clothes shopping and 
tutored me in math at her kitchen table. Together we would obsess over our favorite 
episodes of “Gilmore Girls” and then read through the 2013 “Fiske Guide to Col-
leges.”

I still struggle to come to terms with her death because, for so long, it seemed to 

me that she was never sick. I now realize that for so many years she masked her own 
stress and fear and nausea to protect those around her from feeling even a fraction 
of the pain she did. Despite a severe diagnosis at the age of 43, my aunt continued to 
get dressed for work, travel the world and make it to every family dinner, birthday 
party, band concert and even field hockey game that she physically could.

Maybe my Aunt Paula was a superhero. But then again maybe she was just wor-

ried; worried that she would miss out on things 
— worried that she would upset 

those around her if she let her inner-anxieties show. I’d like to think my aunt’s anx-
ious perfectionism is what allowed her to fight such a scary disease and live life 
to its fullest for eight years. Over time, I’ve come to accept that my own anxiety is 
what drives me toward my personal goals.

I don’t know for sure, but I doubt I’ll ever stop worrying about the small things. 

Then again, I never want to.

I

n an era where you can have a banana slicer, 
glow in the dark toilet paper, sugar-free 
gummi bears, pajamas and the textbook 

you need for class dropped on your doorstep 
in two days via Amazon, it’s hard to believe 
that the company started as a warehouse only 
able to hold a couple hundred books at a time. 
Considering that book sales currently make 
up only 7 percent of the company’s revenue 
annually, how is it possible that a business that 
can only in a small part identify as a “bookseller” 
has, for many people, replaced the need for 
physical bookstores? 

The answer may life in the fact that, although 

the origins of Amazon were in book distribution, 
CEO and Founder Jeff Bezos’ initiative was 
never a seed planted by belief in the inherent 
value of the written word.

In an article for The New Yorker, George 

Packer writes that Bezos “quit his job at a 
Manhattan Hedge fund and moved to Seattle to 
found a company that could ride the exponential 
growth of the early commercial internet.”

I’ve never been a stranger to the independent 

bookstore. As the daughter of two writers 
and a Brooklyn, N.Y. native it was a seemingly 
unavoidable encounter. From pulling “Cat in 
the Hat” and “The Snowy Day” off the bottom 
shelves of Book Court in Carroll Gardens to 
spending hours tucked away in the cozy back 
corner, or in the backyard garden of Park Slope’s 
Community Book Store inhaling anything from 
“Captain Underpants” to “The Princess Diaries” 
— these were sure signs of early literary promise.

My teen angst led me to the better-known 

Strand bookstore. My twin brother Jack and 
I would narrowly avoid Union Square in mid-
December and slip into Strand in pursuit of 
reasonably priced and thoughtful holiday gifts 
for our bookworm family members. We’d end up 

splitting off to our respective sections — he into 
music biographies or world records books, and 
I into the poetry section or scrounging through 
the hodge-podge of $1 gently used gems. 
Although I spend very little time in New York 
these days, I’ll still return to Strand to stumble 
upon a secondhand copy of some classic that still 
smells the way books should.

This is not to say, I, as a 21-year-old on a 

college-student budget, with a deep love for the 
written word, buy all my books at cute mom n’ 
pop shops that carry the best writers you’ve 
never heard of without ever lurking into the 
behemoth that is the world of Amazon or Barnes 
& Noble.

I spent a good portion of my childhood in 

Barnes & Noble, too, but in retrospect these 
moments were different. There weren’t really 
any comfy chairs, and every B & N I’d been to had 
the same aesthetic of light colored wood, dark 
green and neutral-colored woodland animals 
painted onto the walls of the kids’ section. 
Barnes & Noble was where I’d pull out a stack 
of teen magazines that I wasn’t really supposed 
to be reading, or wonder why it seemed that so 
many of the books on display bore the same titles 
as the multiplex cinema marquees with images 
of their conventionally attractive protagonists 
gracing the covers. In my humble opinion, 
the covers had looked just as good the way the 
illustrators had first printed them.

I will still, shamefully, admit that I bought or 

rented all of my books on Amazon this semester 
and last semester even purchased a book for 
$2.99 that I needed for class as an e-book. 
Amid the threats I hear about the perishing of 
the physical book and the worldwide takeover 
of Amazon and e-readers galore, I decided to 
investigate a successful independent bookstore 
in my current stomping grounds.

Ann Arbor’s own Literati, located on East 

Washington Street, has come to characterize 
this phase of my life the way Book Court did my 
toddlerhood and Strand my adolescence. I can 
often be found studying in The Espresso Bar, 
a café that rests above the bookstore. Studying 
might mean nursing a latte and choosing to read 
what my roommate has lovingly coined “one of 
those skinny poetry books” pulled from a shelf 
downstairs while I use my PSYCH 240 textbook 
as a glorified paperweight/armrest.

Literati is one of those bookstores that feels 

alive. From the steady stream of readings to the 
corner location with a big window to let light 
in to the handwritten book recommendations 
punctuating the shelves to the click-clack of 
the available typewriter downstairs, the nearly 
3-year-old book haven buzzes.

I chatted over coffee with Hilary Lowe 

Gustafson and Michael Gustafson, the young 
married couple who own Literati. I asked them 
to look back and reflect on the bookstore’s origin 
story.

In 2011, before opening Literati, they were 

living in Brooklyn where Hilary worked at 
Simon & Schuster Publishing house and part-
time at independent Green Light Bookstore. 
Michael was working as a video artist and 
freelance writer, and the two bonded over a love 
of literary culture, which included independent 
bookstores as a cornerstone of their social lives 
and courtship. 

Hilary and Michael saw Green Light as one of 

their inspirations for opening Literati.

“They started in 2009, after the Kindle and 

after all that and still thrived regardless, so 
they were kind of our model community center 
bookstore,” Hilary said.

Both owners are Michigan natives. Hilary 

is from Ann Arbor and Michael from Lowell, 

Michigan. When Borders closed both in 
Ann Arbor and nationally in 2011, the couple 
saw an opportunity to fill the gap in Ann 
Arbor’s independent bookselling community, 
specializing in new books.

“As part of our social life in New York, we 

would go to bookstores,” Hilary said. “It just 
seemed like a good community space … we 
always talked about what it would be like to own 
a store ourselves.”

When asked about the place of independent 

booksellers in the wake of retailers like Amazon 
and the advent of e-readers, Hilary and Michael 
shared insight into the integrity and unparalleled 
experience of independent bookstores.

“There are more bookstores in the last three 

years opening than closing so we view that as a 
trend, a return to independent bookstores after 
many closed throughout the 2000s,” Michael 
said, identifying the notion that the indie 
bookstore is on the decline as something of a 
fallacy.

The 
owners 
defended 
their 
bookstore 

wholeheartedly, standing by the integrity of 
books, suggesting that a megastore like Amazon 
is unable to recognize the inherent value of 
a book the way an independent business that 
carefully handpicks its contents and creates a 
holistic book-buying experience does.

“We don’t view Amazon as a competitor 

because the product they’re offering is different,” 
Hilary said. “Yeah, they offer a book, but they 
don’t offer a space to explore and browse and 
have whimsy in the same way you have in our 
store.”

“I think that people purchase things online 

that they know that they want, but bookstores 
allow customers to browse and find things 
they didn’t necessarily know that they wanted 
and allow customers a chance to surprise 

themselves,” Michael said.

Whimsy, surprise, chance — the owners spoke almost as if 

the bookstore is an enchanted forest or arcade of sorts. What I 
think they were getting at is a space that engages actively with the 
community, that it’s part of something that Hilary doesn’t believe 
larger booksellers get the opportunity to do.

“You can read reviews of a million people you don’t know, or 

you can come to a bookstore and get to know the staff and find 
someone on the staff that you really love the reading tastes of and 
have a dialogue about that,” Hilary said.

I silently admited that reading the handwritten staff 

recommendations in the store is less daunting than scanning 
through the seemingly infinite reviews on Amazon — it doesn’t 
seem like too many internet trolls frequent the store, but I could 
be mistaken.

Hilary and Michael also highlighted the longevity and novelty 

of the physical book, speaking with a reverence that is not 
necessarily felt toward multi-decade-old e-readers or laptops. We 
discussed the value of electronics when compared to books.

“They (electronics) lose their value and their purpose in a way 

that a book doesn’t over time,” Hilary said. 

“Yet they’re so expensive,” Michael added.
Michael also touched on the bookstore’s logo — a typewriter.
“Our logo is a typewriter that was based on a model my 

grandmother gave me and it was my grandfather’s typewriter 
from the 1930s; it still works,” he said. “I inherently don’t believe 
that many of the e-reading devices in 80 years from now will 
work. I can browse her bookshelves and find books from 100 years 
ago and still read them. I inherently believe in physical paper 
books being long-lasting, durable products that will be around for 
hundreds of years.”

Keeping with the typewriter anecdote, it’s important to note 

that in the basement section of Literati, where nonfiction books 
are housed, there is a maroon Olympia typewriter available for 
anyone to use. It wears a typewritten sign that says, “Please be 
gentle with me. I’m old.”

It’s clear that there are emotional values and family histories 

tied up in the business. Belief in the book is sustained with fervor.

“I have a book that was given to me on my 21st birthday and 

the little inscriptions are handwritten in there,” Michael said. 
“That’s meaningful to me, more than receiving a gift certificate 
to Amazon. I think it’s just inherently believing in the future of 
that, that made us both want to start the store and made us want 
to keep going.”

Much of Literati’s success has depended on their engagement 

with other small businesses and nonprofit groups in the area, as 
well as their robust events calendar. For example, The Espresso 
Bar subleases the second floor of the building from Literati. It 
provides both businesses with larger space for people to read, 
chat and work. It also serves as a spot for the bookstore to seat 
audiences during readings and other literary events.

“They needed more space and we needed more space and 

we don’t know coffee,” Michael said. “We know books and we 
wanted a coffee shop but we didn’t have the expertise to do it so 
we partnered with some of the best coffee baristas in town. It’s 
been successful thus far.”

The coffee shop and bookstore work in healthy symbiosis. The 

relaxing atmosphere of browsing the shelves is well supplemented 
by a caffeine fix, and for coffee lovers who come to The Espresso 
Bar, the spattering of signed new releases upstairs might be a 
happy accident.

Hilary and Michael have also collaborated with organizations 

such as Wolverine Press, a printing press run out of the University, 
as well as other local and independent publishers, furthering a 
commitment to community involvement and building healthy 
relationships with local retailers. They also collaborate with 
the University’s English department through the Zell Fellows 
Reading Series.

“We try to work with a lot of University folks who have their 

own books out, especially in the poetry department,” Michael said.

Literati even collaborated with a group of Engineering students 

on a project, an example of one of the ways the store seeks to build 
a relationship with the University.

“We had a group of Engineering students use us for one of their 

projects to help us figure out ways to better make our store more 
efficient because as bookstore people we’re not the most efficient 
people sometimes. That was awesome because it allowed them to 
get some insight into how a small business works and we got the 
expertise of them as students,” Hilary said.

Hilary and Michael started Literati out of a love for the town 

and a desire to contribute to its ethos of successful independent 
businesses.

“We do it because we love this town and we want to make it 

more vibrant,” Hilary said. “By partnering with other people you 
reach a broader base. People can do something creative that may 
not have been done before.”

“It takes a village to raise a bookstore,” Michael added.
He continued this with an analogy that compares the 

cultivation of the Literati community to the experience of raising 
a child. It seems fitting, as the bookstore was born shortly before 
the owners got married.

“In the first six months, you’re just trying to make sure that 

the child survives,” he said. “It’s a lot of sleepless and long nights 
and worry and kinda freakin’ out and then it gets easier, and right 
now this bookstore is sort of walking and talking and it’s getting 
there and now instead of survival, we’re getting more into the 
personality stage, doing more with the community and becoming 
better community members.”

I left with an admiration for the ambition and integrity of the 

store, and believe in the magic and importance of independent 
bookstores, but I am still left with questions, reluctant to reduce 
my interest in the economics of the bookselling to a polarizing 
debate that pits the Amazons of the world against the Literatis.

Having a friendly and familiar local bookstore like Literati to 

linger and explore is a treasure, but what about communities that 
are limited in this respect and must rely on Amazon to read books 
they want to read?

Maybe putting books alongside video games or hard-to-find 

snack foods can draw in an audience that otherwise wouldn’t 
have much of an interest, but what does the commodification of a 
book do for writers who, as Packer puts it, are put “under pressure 
to prove that their work produced sales?”

Maybe the world of commercial book sales is not even in the 

same ballpark as the independent bookstore model. According 
to Business Insider, Amazone tends to pursue detail-oriented 
introverts who generally lacked well-developed interpersonal 
skills as employees, a personality type that would most likely not 
facilitate success in a social and community-based institution like 
Literati.

Navigating the book world is complicated. It can force readers, 

writers, business owners, artists, educators and editors to 
question the benefits or obstacles in the evolution of bookselling. 
It asks us to wonder what these changes suggest about the way we 
value the creation and production of books. I am grateful to attend 
school in a place where great literary culture is accessible. There 
are bookstores that have allowed me to feel like the excitement 
and spontaneity of discovering books and sharing that with other 
people is alive and well. It gives me hope for those who lead lives 
as artists, writers and educators who depend on the power of the 
printed word and know what I mean when I talk about that nice 
“old book” smell.

MONEYBALL: 

by Karl Williams, Managing Statement Editor

F

rom the standpoint of an economist, it’s 
often difficult to measure the financial 
performance of a company in relation 

to the quality of its product. But sports offer a 
remarkably clear competitive market — there’s 
no ambiguity whether a team wins or loses.

While the performance of the players on the 

field determines a team’s success, thousands of 
economic factors determine how those teams 
get their players. Unlike in the American sports 
industry — with the exception of Major League 
Baseball — where teams share revenue through 
a salary cap, European soccer clubs lack such 
a system. The system, inevitably, leads to 
inequalities among teams — only a handful of 
teams dominate their respective leagues. These 
teams, in turn, dominate the most prestigious 
European competition, the UEFA (Union of 
European Football Associations) Champions 
League.

Research into what makes teams succeed 

and fail — both on and off the field — continues 
to grow. Various factors, such as players, stadi-
ums, revenue, debt, taxation, regulation and so 
on, all determine whether or not a team will be 
able to compete.

Kinesiology prof. Stefan Szymanski has been 

one of the leading researchers in this growing 
field. His research, which can be seen in books 
such as “Soccernomics” and his latest book 
“Money and Soccer,” attempts to explain on-
field performance through the lens of finance.

Though born in Nigeria to a Polish father and 

English mother, Szymanski has spent most of 
his life in London, with the exception of his col-
lege days in Oxford, where he studied politics, 
philosophy and economics, and his time as a 
professor at the University. Growing up in Eng-
land, Stefan Szymanski has always been a soccer 
fan (his favorite team is Scunthorpe United), but 
it wasn’t until he began graduate school at the 
London Business School that he began to seri-

ously study the economics of the game.

“What I was really doing was research about 

markets and industries, so really understanding 
how firms relate to each other in an industry, 
how competition works between firms, what 
makes for better outcomes or worse outcomes, 
how to evaluate policy and those kind of things,” 
Szymanski said. “And I really got into it through 
a group of us who were trying to find out how 
certain groups were successful.

Soccer, he added, seemed like a good exam-

ple because there were many clubs, but few 
with continous success. “We were trying to 
understand that,” he said. “With sports though 
it’s actually crystal clear — you know who won 
the league, how many people went to watch the 
game, so in that sense it’s actually much easier 
to tie in financial performance with visible met-
rics of performance which reflect consumer 
interest.”

Szymanski began his research into the 

industry’s economics right when things were 
beginning to change within it, especially in the 
U.K. During the 1980s, soccer was not a partic-
ularly profitable sport, and Margaret Thatcher, 
then prime minister, even considered banning 
the sport because of hooliganism and stadium 
collapses. Many believed the industry was one 
of decay, not growth. Since then, profits have 
soared, and the industry has become incredibly 
lucrative.

How did such a drastic change occur? 

According to Szymanski, because of a collec-
tion of fortunate circumstances. First of all, the 
broadcasting environment changed — Premier 
League clubs’ revenue increased through deals 
with television broadcasters.

“The Premier League was able to generate 

very large increases in revenues from domestic 
viewers who wanted to watch this as the rights 
were given to cable TV,” Szymanski said.

Furthermore, over the last 20 years or so, 

international broadcasting, which is distributed 
equally among teams, has become an increas-
ingly important part of revenue, approaching 
nearly half of the total.

But the change in broadcasting was not the 

only factor to change the game’s financial land-
scape.

“Other factors are that there was a lot of 

interest from overseas in investing in English 
soccer clubs, and partly that had to do with the 
fact that the U.K. is a relatively easy place for 
foreigners to invest in,” Szymanski said. “It’s 
been a relatively welcoming environment for 
that.”

He added that the clubs’ global recogni-

tion also played a role. “It’s also to do with 
that the U.K. soccer clubs have global recogni-
tion. That’s partly because of the old empire, 
and people knew about soccer going back a 
hundred years. And the other thing is the time 
zone — people can follow English soccer games 
because the times they’re played at make them 
accessible both in the Far East and the United 
States. And, again, that’s a real advantage if 
you’re trying to sell a sport.”

While in America one can expect a certain 

level of parity among teams in most leagues — 
which is mostly due to the salary cap that most 
leagues employ — European soccer leagues are 
almost shockingly unequal. For example, over 
the last 25 years in Spain, either Barcelona or 
Real Madrid has won La Liga, the Spanish soc-
cer league, 21 times. No American league — not 
even the MLB — features such dominance by a 
few teams. Although there are many giants of 
their sports, such as the Yankees and Lakers, 
there are no clubs that win with such little com-
petition. While the best teams succeed with lit-
tle to stop them, those near the bottom face the 
threat of capitulation. Such disparity, according 
to Szymanski, forms a model of dominance and 
distress.

But perhaps, as Szymanski notes in his lat-

est book “Money and Soccer: A Soccernomics 
Guide,” relative equality among teams is not 
a necessity. In fact, Szymanski argues that “It 
is simply not clear that fans want a balanced 
competition.” In other words, inequality is not 
a problem. The dominance of a few teams has 
done nothing to discourage fans from watching.

In fact, soccer has been more successful than 

ever in generating revenue and interest in the 
game. As Szymanski writes, it’s almost para-
doxical how this works.

“It may seem counterintuitive at first, but 

open competition with unlimited freedom of 
entry has created a system in which only a few 
clubs can win consistently. The market works 
relatively efficiently, in the sense that money 
buys success, and improving teams generate 
increasing revenues because they attract new 
fans.”

Yet many still believe that inequality is bad 

for the game.

“There is this common folk wisdom that 

unless a league is balanced, unless all the teams 
have a reasonable chance of winning, the league 
will become predictable and people will lose 
interest, so the league will die,” Szymanski said. 
“That folk myth is clung to by an enormous 
amount of people, probably most people in the 
world think that’s true, but it just factually is not 
the case. Leagues can be attractive even if they 
have massive amounts of inequality.”

Recently, Szymanski has worked with FIF-

Pro, the world soccer players’ union, on anti-
trust litigation that challenges the transfer 
system, a system in which teams buy the rights 
to players and currently gives players little 
agency. A successful suit would change the way 
the game is run financially and, thus, how the 
product comes together on the field. But no 
matter how the game changes, Szymanski will 
be there to explain it.

Personal Statement: Invisible Identity

by Isobel Futter, Daily Staff Reporter

E

veryone knows what the dreaded 
first day of class is like — usually 
in a small discussion room, sur-

rounded by 20 people you don’t know. We 
all stare at the clock, passing awkward 
smiles at our neighbors and waiting for the 
minute hand to hit 10 and for the profes-
sor to start talking. Unfortunately, 
the class almost always begins with 
this: Let’s go around the room and 
say your name and an interesting 
fact about yourself.

For some reason, it’s really hard 

to look at yourself and imagine 
something interesting. That’s not 
intended to sound self-deprecat-
ing, as we’re all interesting people 
in some way, shape or form! But it 
is hard to look into yourself, and 
choose a fact that both you and the 
crowd will find intriguing. You also 
ride the fine line of being boastful 
or being uninteresting, with neither 
option appealing in this situation. 
I usually end up going for, “I ride 
for the equestrian team,” or “I am a 
writer for The Michigan Daily.”

It never occurs to me to tell my 

peers probably the most interesting 
and defining fact about myself: I’m 
an international.

I began the privilege of travelling 

and seeing different parts of the 
world at a very young age.

I spent my first six years living 

in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. 
I grew up surrounded by good food, 
different types of people and the 
ability to travel whenever a holi-
day came around. I spoke French at 
school and when playing with my 
sister but English with my parents. 
We visited most of Western Europe 
in my childhood, and I grew up with 
a passion for language and culture.

When I was six, my family moved 

to Ireland for my dad’s job. I remem-
ber the excitement and anticipation 
that filled my small body after my 
parents sat my sister and I down to 
tell us the big news.

“We’re moving to a town called 

Cork, in a country called Ireland,” 
my mother said to us, gauging our 
reactions with hope. “There’ll be 
a big garden and the school is just 
down the road, so you won’t have to 
take the bus anymore.”

When we moved to Cork, not 

much changed. As is apropos for a 
six-year-old, I was dismayed with 
the idea of a Catholic private school 
uniform. But I adjusted quickly and made 
friends in no time. I even developed an 
Irish accent and hid my foreign status 
almost immediately.

After roughly 18 months in Cork, my 

family relocated once more to the United 
States. I lived in Midland, Michigan from 
the ages of eight to 18.

Despite living in all these different 

countries and having these different cul-
tural experiences, I am not from any of the 

places I know so well. I am not Belgian. 
Or Irish. Or American. I’m English. As 
you can imagine, this is confusing to me. 
How could I be from a place that I’ve never 

lived, a place that is only connected to me 
through my family?

My parents are both British and met 

after university in Birmingham, England. 
They moved to Belgium, got married and 
had me there. We visited both sets of 
grandparents in England on a regular basis 

when living in Europe. Now that we’re in 
the States, we make the leap across the 
pond once a year to do the rounds. How-
ever, as often as I visited the UK, I could 

never imagine it as my home. After all, 
I’d never even lived there. It was a place 
where I went to kiss my grandparents, 
be told how tall I’d gotten and spend far 
too much time in a tiny rental car on the 
crowded M25.

I’d spent my whole life blending into 

places that I didn’t really belong. 
I changed my accent, the clothes I 
wore, the games I played to fit in 
and become a part of the surround-
ing way of life. It boggles my mind 
a little to believe that, although I 
spent so much energy relating to 
these foreign cultures, they can be 
no part of my formal identity. I am 
restricted to one nationality, one 
passport.

As I’ve gotten older and my trips 

to Europe continue, I’ve started 
receiving a series of strange ques-
tions. Since I rarely bring it up, and 
surely not during the interesting 
fact exercise, my peers at school are 
often shocked to learn that I’m not 
American.

“Why don’t you get citizen-

ship?” I’m often asked. My answer 
is I don’t know, because I don’t feel 
American. After traveling around 
so often when I was younger, the 
possibility of relocating again, this 
time for a job of my own, is highly 
plausible.

Similar to the former question, I 

also get a, “Do you feel more Eng-
lish or American?” when visiting 
my family.

These complex questions have 

racked my brain for a majority of 
my adult life (which, to be fair, isn’t 
that long). But recently, I’ve come 
to a solution — I feel that I repre-
sent a small part of every place I’ve 
lived and visited. I feel equally con-
nected to my British heritage as I do 
to my American upbringing. I am as 
Belgian as I am Irish. The words 
on a passport, a green card or visa 
don’t define your personal nation-
ality; you do.

The conclusion to this long-

winding search of identity comes 
down to the person you want to be, 
and the identity you want to have. I 
want to take small pieces from each 
of my experiences and credit them 
to the person I am today. Without 
the time I spent in each of those 
places, and without the connec-
tions I made with those people, my 
life would be completely different.

So, when people ask me, “Where are 

you from?”, I’ll probably still crack a smile, 
laugh and answer, “Well, that’s compli-
cated.”

IT’S COMPLICATED

Though the annual North American International Auto Show in Detroit 

is catered primarily to adults and car fanatics, the massive halls were also 
full of shiny new rides and children scrambling in, around, and over them, 

waiting for their doting parents to snap a picture.
