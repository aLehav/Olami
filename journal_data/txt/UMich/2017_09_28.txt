University 
of 
Michigan 

students have been organizing 
protests and demonstrations in 
the last two weeks after a slew 
of anti-Latino and anti-Black 
incidents. The Daily sat down 
with 
University 
president 

Mark Schlissel to talk students’ 
reactions, his responses and 
administrators’ actions moving 
forward.

Schlissel 
said 
focusing 

on the lack of success in 
catching racist perpetrators 
is 
“not 
productive.” 
The 

administration will be rolling 
out an online tracker of bias 
incidents 
in 
the 
coming 

weeks—though he said he has 
not caught wind of many good 
policy proposals yet. Schlissel’s 
main priority remains building 
a community of support for 
students. 

The Michigan Daily: How 

have you been processing this 
month’s 
events? 
Yesterday 

was the one-year anniversary 
of the (racist) flyers from last 
year, and it feels like events are 
repeating themselves, but then 
again, this energy feels unique 
this year.

President Mark Schlissel: 

There’s a cumulative effect 
here, right? These episodes 
in the last week or two aren’t 
the first ever, and they’re 
not the first since I’ve been 
here. You know, it seems like 
their frequency and intensity 
are 
increasing 
if 
anything 

else. I think it has the entire 
community on edge, including 
me and my leadership teams; 
we’re trying to find a way 
to send messages of support 
and attempt to identify the 
perpetrators of these various 
episodes, but also help people 
stay on task, stay on the reason 
everyone’s here is to learn and 
to progress in your lives, and 
not have the time stolen away 
from you by evil-doers.

TMD: On those messages of 

support, you know one of the 
first demands we often hear 
from students is for you, for a 
statement —

Schlissel: — I don’t think 

there’s any ambiguity about 
how I feel about these episodes. 
The responses to every one 
of them have been consistent: 
that racism, bigotry — any 
forms of attack on a person and 
who they are, their heritage — 
they’re unacceptable, they’re 
not part of our community, 
they’re not who we are.

The fact that after each one 

of these episodes it becomes 
an issue about whether (I’m) 
tweeting 
or 
emailing 
or 

Facebooking or whatever form 
of media people pay attention 
to, and that becomes the issue 

… whether I respond in one 
hour or four hours, or whether 
I respond with a tweet or an 
email, I don’t think that’s the 
real issue. I don’t think anyone 
should wonder whether or not 
the president is against racism. 

I 
think 
we 
are 
letting 

ourselves get distracted from 
the 
real 
challenge, 
which 

is supporting one another; 
making sure that if we see 
something, we say something, 
so we might actually have a 
chance 
of 
catching 
people 

doing some of these bad things; 
and most importantly trying to 
put these hurtful and hateful 
events in a context that allows 
us not to let the bad guys 
rob us of our opportunity to 
accomplish what we want to 
here at the University.

TMD: 
Speaking 
of 
this 

“small group of people,” the 
University has a history of 
progressive activism, and a 
very high profile in the national 
higher education landscape. 
It seems to have developed 
something of a target on its 
back. How do you mitigate 
that?

Schlissel: I don’t think you 

can. I think that part of being 
a prominent university, taking 
clear 
positions 
on 
things, 

having large numbers of very 
successful graduates out there 
in the world, being on TV all 
the time, being in the media 
all the time means that what 
happens here gets noticed. 
That’s the sort of other side 
of this double-edged sword of 
being famous and prominent. … 
It’s because of our prominence 
that 
provocateurs 
realize 

they can use us as a platform 
that the national media will 
pay attention to, to spread 
their 
terrible, 
thoughtless, 

degrading, awful ideas. They’re 
using us.

TMD: I know you spoke 

with Dana Greene, who was 
kneeling in the Diag, and with 
a lot of protesters and students 
in the last week. What kind of 
conversations have you been 
having, and what have you 
been hearing?

Schlissel: A lot of what I try 

to do is listen and understand 
what 
they’re 
experiencing 

to make sure I understand 
it as best as I can, and then 
to offer words of support 
and 
encouragement 
to 
let 

the people who are directly 
affected — because really all of 
us are being directly affected 
in one way or another — know 
that this does not represent our 
value system.

The city of Ann Arbor has 

officially named Brad O’Furey 
and Sgt. Dawn Murphy as this 
year’s LGBTQ liaisons.

The position, created last year 

by Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 
Taylor, is a volunteer role that 
serves to help answer questions 
and provide a safe community for 
Ann Arbor’s LGBTQ population. 
While no specific incidents led to 
the creation of the position, Taylor 
told the Daily last August it was 
the result of a recommendation 
from the city’s Human Rights 
Commission.

“Ann Arbor has an active 

human 
rights 
commission 

that focuses very carefully on 
LGBTQ rights,” Taylor said. 
“They recommend that there 
be such a position, and we were 
delighted to create one.”

O’Furey was the first person 

to take on the liaison role last 
year, and will reprise it this 
year. He is the immediate 
past president of the Jim 
Toy Community Center in 
Kerrytown and a longtime 
LGBTQ activist.

“With the volatile nature 

of the country today, I think 
it’s important the community 
should 
have 
their 
voices 

represented 
… 
especially 

with the increased number 
of 
transgender 
Americans 

who are underserved by these 
communities,” O’Furey said. 
“I have existing relationships 

with 
people 
in 
the 
city 

government — with the mayor, 
with City Council — so I felt that 
(this position) was a good use of 
my skills and my connections in 
the community to provide that 
voice to the community at large.”

O’Furey 
spent 
the 
past 

year working with the police 
department and the Human 
Rights 
Commission 
to 
help 

educate law enforcement officials 
on how to create a city that is safe 
and welcoming for marginalized 
folks.

“(I’ve been) creating a police 

department that is more educated 
on these issues and how to 

respond to harassment, what 
terms to use, asking folks what 
pronouns they want to use when 
dealing with the community,” he 
said.

The close connection to the 

police department last year is 
what led Sgt. Dawn Murphy to 
join O’Furey as a liaison this year. 
As a law enforcement official 
herself, Murphy is committed 
to bridging the gap between the 
department and the community, 
and helping the two groups learn 
from and about each other.

A video posted on the public 

University of Michigan campus-
area 
Snapchat 
story 
early 

Wednesday 
morning 
appears 

to show an unidentified man 
urinating on the Block ‘M’ in the 
Diag, and on the “Black Lives 
Matter” writing spray-painted 
around it. 

LSA senior Hoai An Pham 

shared the video on Facebook 
around noon on Wednesday, 
encouraging her audience to 
identify the man if they knew him.

“9 hours ago, this white male 

decided to go up to the M on the 
Diag and urinate on the Black 
Lives Matter words that are 
around it and then posted it on 
snapchat. Those words were put 
there in response to the racist 
hate crimes on campus,” she 
wrote. “Tell me again that we live 
in a post racial world. Please share 
widely.”

University 
of 
Michigan 

Division of Public Safety and 
Security 
spokeswoman 
Diane 

Brown said DPSS officers are 
currently 
investigating 
the 

incident.

Schlissel puts

new policy

Puerto Rican students anxious for 
family following Hurricane Maria

“‘We belong to the U.S., but we are not part 
of the U.S.’ … that’s a rough translation of a 
quote I’ve heard. It basically means that, 
yeah, if you say Puerto Rico, some people 
know it's part of the U.S. and some people 
don't … and some people don’t even 
recognize us as legitimate Americans."

Community members organize fundraisers for island despite Trump admin. inaction

Extreme weather systems have 

devastated the western coasts 
of North and Central America. 
Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane 
Irma struck at the beginning 
of the month, followed by a 6.1 

magnitude earthquake in Mexico, 
and now a Category 5-turned-
Category-4 
Hurricane 
Maria. 

While all have left great damage 
in their paths, Maria has been 
arguably the most destructive, 
hitting Puerto Rico Wednesday 
morning, 
and 
continuing 
its 

course through the country for 
more than 24 hours.

The detrimental effects of 

Hurricane Maria have only added 
onto the economic crisis Puerto 
Rico has faced in the past decade, 
which was caused by debt and 
recession.

LSA senior Juan Fossas was 

born and raised in San Juan, 
Puerto Rico. His family has been 
confirmed as safe, 

yet his connection to them is 
extremely limited as only one of 
his extended family members has 
had working cell service.

“Thankfully my house is well 

built and concrete,” he said. “I 
knew my family would be fine, 
but it’s mainly the other people 
I’m worried about. My neighbors,

DISPL AY
Local pizzarias Bella Italia and 

Pizza Pino are closing after years of 
serving Ann Arbor residents.

Bella Italia, owned by Jim and 

Katie Millan, recently announced 
on their Facebook page that they 
would be ending their business on 
Sept. 23. The restaurant was opened 
11 years ago on 895 Eisenhower 
Parkway. The post received 
multiple supportive messages 
and representatives from the 
restaurant replied thanking them 
but expressing that they wanted 
to make a change. The Millans 
emphasized that while they loved 
running the restaurant, it required a 
lot of time and energy.

“My husband Jim and I owned 

Bella for eleven years. We have a 
seven year old daughter, and we 
decided we needed to spend more 
time together as a family,” Katie 
Millan wrote in an email. “We 
would like to thank the community 
for all their support over the years; 
it really was a great adventure for 
Jim and I.”

Bella Italia is best known for 

its “Ann Arbor Pizza Challenge,” 
promising a free 30-inch pizza to 
any group of three people who can 
finish the dish within 30 minutes. 
Rules stipulate that the pizza must 
be finished and in the players’ 
stomachs.

Pizza Pino shut down 

without warning, the exact date 
unknown but was reported by 
MLive this morning, with a note 
reading “closed” popping up on 
the front door of the Ann Arbor 
establishment at 221 W Liberty 
St. Calls to the restaurant went 
unanswered and its social media 
pages remain silent, leaving 
residents wondering if the 
restaurant is closed for good. The 
joint is not facing any suspensions 
related to safety or health concerns, 
and its LLC license is still active.

Pizza Pino was known for its 

deep-dish pizzas and variety of 
specialty choices.

ON THE DAILY: NO MORE DOUGH

people that live in poorer areas, 
people that live close to rivers.”

According 
to 
Fossas, 
his 

family and some close friends 
have all congregated in his 
home as a temporary solution 
to the long-term process of 
restabilization. It has been said 
regaining electricity throughout 
the country may take up to six 
months.

Fossas has not asked for any 

extra support in the form of 
classes off, but he said that he 
has no doubt the University of 
Michigan 
community 
would 

provide support in such an 
instance.

“People 
here 
are 
very 

understanding. A friend of mine, 
a fellow Puerto Rican, has been 
reached out to by professors who 
asked him if he needs help,” he 
said. “Students have been really 
helpful too, anyone who knows 
that I’m from Puerto Rico has 
asked me if my family is OK, if 
everything is good.”

Fossas 
expressed 
his 

frustration with the lack of 

representation of Puerto Rico 
in U.S. politics as well as media 
coverage, claiming they are 
stuck in a political and economic 
middle-ground, and are not 
treated equally as citizens.

“‘We belong to the U.S., but 

we are not part of the U.S.’ … 
that’s a rough translation of a 
quote I’ve heard,” he said. “It 
basically means that, yeah, if you 
say Puerto Rico, some people 
know it’s part of the U.S. and 
some people don’t … and some 
people don’t even recognize us 
as legitimate Americans.”

According 
to 
Fossas, 
the 

main challenge Puerto Ricans 
must face to gain support is 
the lack of representation in 
media outlets. He compared the 
nearly 24-hour news coverage 
of Hurricane Harvey to the 
far lesser coverage of Maria in 
Puerto Rico.

“Trump supposedly declared 

us in a state of emergency, but 
nothing has been done yet,” 
he said. “We’re barely getting 
any federal aid. He tweeted a 
couple times, but how many 
tweets about football players 
and Kaepernick and Curry? 
It’s all been about that; it’s so 
frustrating. That is something 

so inconsequential, while there’s 
3.5 million American citizens 
suffering back in Puerto Rico.”

Students at the University 

have 
gathered 
together 
in 

various ways to fundraise for 
Puerto Rico and provide support 
to the Puerto Rican student 
population.

Engineering 
freshman 

Natalia Sanchez is a Puerto 
Rican 
student 
who 
began 

her 
own 
initiative. 
After 

hearing the devastating news 
about 
the 
hurricane, 
she 

began to brainstorm ideas for 
fundraising, and found one 
that stuck: selling T-shirts. Her 
project raised $1,000 in the first 
four days, and she has gained 
support from the directors of 
her living-learning community, 
the 
Michigan 
Community 

Scholars Program.

“I’m honestly just glad that 

what I’m doing is having a 
positive outcome,” she said. 
“I’m pretty sure that you can 
ask any other Puerto Rican who 
isn’t living in the island right 
now how they’re feeling, and 
they’ll tell you that it’s just so 
distressing. That it just doesn’t 
feel real. That, no matter what, 
they’ll do anything to help.”

On a national level, the 

GoFundMe 
Students 
with 

Puerto Rico has been created, 
which is bringing together the 
fundraising efforts of more 
than 100 universities around 
the United States, including 
the University of Michigan. 
The proceeds are to go directly 
to Unidos por Puerto Rico, an 
initiative enacted by Puerto 
Rico’s 
first 
lady, 
Beatriz 

Roselló, 
in 
collaboration 

with private companies. It 
was initially proposed after 
Hurricane 
Irma 
and 
has 

expanded 
after 
Hurricane 

Maria’s occurrence.

LSA 
senior 
Amanda 

Santiago has extended family 
living in Puerto Rico, and 
has extended family living in 
Puerto Rico. Though she was 
able to contact them two days 
ago, she is still worried for 
other students’ families.

“A lot of my friends still don’t 

have family members that 
they’ve heard from,” she said.

As a kid, I soaked up 

television like a sponge. I 
spent a lot of time watching 
Nickelodeon, 
(“Spongebob” 

is the best show, don’t @ me), 
but don’t worry — I watched 
the educational PBS shows 
too. All media geared toward 
children is very fun and 
friendly, but as I got older 
and transitioned away from 
cartoons, the media started 
to feel more like it wanted to 
be my enemy instead of my 
friend. For the new target 
audience that I joined as I 
got older, the media’s focus 
on 
educational 
television 

was seemingly replaced by a 
hidden curriculum that I then 
learned and internalized.

The hidden curriculum of 

the media teaches you what 
it means to be any race in 
America. It is hidden because 
these racial lessons are not 
explicitly taught; but they are 
eventually perceived when you 
notice that the hero is often 
portrayed by a white man 
(Captain America, Superman, 
Iron Man, Spiderman) but the 
villain is usually darker (Scar 
from “The Lion King,” Ursula 
from “The Little Mermaid,” 
Shan Yu from “Mulan”). Or 
when you notice that the 
news tells us that when white 
people riot in the streets 
after a football game, they’re 
just wild college kids doing 
what college kids do, but 
when Black people riot after 
the shooting of yet another 
unarmed Black person, they 
are called thugs, and savages. 
In television shows, in movies, 
in magazines, white is often 
synonymous with wealth and 
power. It is synonymous with 
being smart, being the main 
character (“Friends,” “How I 
Met Your Mother,” “Hannah 
Montana”), 
being 
nice, 

liking indie and alternative 
music, being good, getting 
good 
grades, 
success 
and 

happiness. It is associated 
with pretty, popular and fun. 
In the media, white people 
are doctors, lawyers, cops, 
teachers, CEOs and heroes. 
But, in the same shows, white 
people can also play the 
villains and drug addicts, they 
play people with mental and 
physical disabilities, liberal 
and conservative mentalities.

On TV, white people are 

often 
shown 
liking 
indie, 

alternative, or rock music, 
but there are also white 
characters who like rap, hip 
hop, and jazz. White people 
are generally portrayed as 
multidimensional, 
dynamic 

people, 
glaringly 
positive 

but also with the potential 
to be negative. This in itself 
is 
a 
privilege 
that 
many 

people may not even notice, 
because it is so ingrained into 

our society. White people 
can walk through life with 
the belief that they can be 
anything that they want to be 
because of these portrayals. 
They can be the doctor or the 
lawyer, they can be interested 
in anything, they can be 
smart. But they can also be 
the villain or the drug addict, 
they can be anything and still 
be praised for it, and gain 
sympathy. There is nothing 
in the media stopping white 
people from being whoever 
or whatever they want to be, 
because the media has told 
them that as long as their skin 
is white, anything goes. If you 
don’t believe me, take a look at 
our current president/reality 
TV star; I wonder how he got 
the job?

For minorities, the media 

portrayal 
is 
often 
a 
bit 

different. 
Minorities 
are 

often presented in one way 
— usually a stereotype — and 
those stereotypes can have 
a big influence on the way 
that they move through this 
world. Being a Black girl, I 
cannot speak for my fellow 
minorities on how the media’s 
representation of them makes 
them feel; however, I do know 
how the media has made me 
feel. The media has not always 
portrayed Black people in a 
positive light. I, like many 
other 
Black 
people, 
have 

learned from the media that 
“white is right”. 

I have learned that my 

brown skin has doomed me to 
be the antithesis of my white 
classmates. If they are smart, I 
am dumb; if they are wealthy, 
I am poor; if they are the 
standard of beauty, and I am 
missing the slender nose, the 
straight blonde hair and the 
blue eyes, what does that make 
me? Why is a movie with a 
white lead fit for all audiences, 
but a movie with a Black lead 
is just a “Black movie”? Why 
do I see so many of my fellow 
Black people portrayed as 
violent gang members, thugs 

and killers on television? Why 
is every interracial couple that 
I see on television a Black man 
and a white girl? Are Black 
girls undesirable? Why is it 
that the physical features that 
naturally occur on people who 
look like me are repulsive, 
but the tan skin, full lips, and 
big butt are praised on Kylie 
Jenner? Why is it okay for 
Connor to listen to Vampire 
Weekend, Blake Shelton and 
Fall Out Boy, but it’s a surprise 
or not “Black enough” when 
Jerrell does it? Why is it that 
Black people are portrayed as 
“loud and ghetto”? Why has 
ghetto become a synonym for 
Black?

Why is it a surprise that I go 

to the University of Michigan 
but no one is shocked that 
Sarah goes here? Why is it 
that George Zimmerman shot 
and killed Trayvon Martin 
for walking while Black? How 
was Darren Wilson able to 
shoot Michael Brown without 
being found guilty? Why do 
they hate Barack Obama but 
adore Donald Trump? Why 
is it that I have to go out in 
the streets and scream to the 
world that my life matters, 
but white people have never 
needed to do that — unless of 
course, you’re one of the Nazis 
that unnecessarily gathered in 
Charlottesville? You get the 
picture.

The media’s portrayal of 

Black people has led me to 
all of these questions. It has 
led me to question my own 
identity as a Black person. 
If Black people are these 
negative things, how could 
I ever be anything great? If 
Black people aren’t smart, 
only speak one way, only like 
rap music and are inherently 
violent, does that mean I’m 
not Black enough? The media’s 
perception of Black people 
needs to change; only then 
can we create a more positive 
environment for Black people 
to grow up in. Black people 
should not have to feel like 
they are not as good as white 
people, they should not have 
to feel like they need to fit 
the media’s stereotypes to be 
considered Black, and they 
should not have to be slain in 
the streets because the media 
causes people to associate 
blackness with violence.

 Only in recent years 

have I learned that I am Black 
enough. The media tells us 
that there is only one way to 
be Black, and that that one 
way is never as good as all the 
ways that white people are, 
but I’d call that fake news. 
Black people can be anything 
that they want to be, there is 
no one definition of Black. 
Anything that I am is as Black 
as my beautiful skin that is 
dripping in melanin. I am 
not the Black person that the 
media created; I am the real 
thing.

The First Amendment: 
An Exclusive Right to 
White Americans? 

The media and me

JASON ROWLAND

MiC Columnist

Imagine this: It’s a Sunday 

afternoon and you’re on your 
way home for the evening. To 
your annoyance, the route you 
normally take has more traffic 
than 
normal. 
Initially, 
the 

bumper-to-bumper backup is 
inching along, but it quickly 
grinds to a complete halt. After 
a while, you turn on the radio 
to find out what’s causing the 
holdup. Surprisingly, you learn 
it’s not due to an accident or 
overturned truck; it’s due to a 
protest organized against racism 
and discrimination. How would 
you respond?

Now, 
how 
would 
your 

response change if this were on 
March 7, 1965, and the road you 
were stuck on was Route 80, just 
outside of Selma, Ala.? The day 
is “Bloody Sunday,” and activist 
John Lewis is marching with 
about 600 protesters from Selma 
to Montgomery. Regardless of 
how you claim to feel about the 
civil rights movement, chances 
are that your current reaction 
to anti-racism demonstrations 
(from 
Black 
Lives 
Matter 

protests to NFL players taking 
a knee during the national 
anthem) would be identical to 
how you would have reacted 
during the civil rights movement 
50 years ago.

Don’t believe me? According 

to a Gallup poll conducted in 
October of 1964, almost three-
fourths of Americans believed 
civil 
rights 
demonstrators 

should stop protesting, despite 
many of their demands being 
unfulfilled. Additionally, a New 
York Times poll conducted 

during the same year found 
that 
a 
majority 
of 
white 

New Yorkers felt civil rights 
protesters had gone too far, 
with common complaints about 
“negroes receiving ‘everything 
on a silver platter’” and the 
growth of perceived “reverse 
discrimination” against whites. 
These sentiments are still cited 
by Americans who denounce 
efforts 
to 
create 
a 
more 

inclusive country, from critics 
of kneeling to people against 
affirmative action. Ironically, 
while these people probably 
would have been against the 
civil rights movement had they 
been alive at the time, they are 
the first to wistfully compare 
today’s 
demonstrations 
to 

demonstrations of the past, as 
if their attitudes would be any 
different.

In addition to those who 

are 
seemingly 
against 
any 

form of protest, there are even 
more people who support the 
cause of racial equality but 
do little to support it. In fact, 
they’re often more critical of 
the methods demonstrators use 
to achieve equality than about 
the issues being protested in the 
first place. Usually, you can spot 
this happening when someone 
wishes 
protesters 
used 
less 

obstructive means. While they 
may explicitly say something 
along the lines of “I get where 
they’re coming from, I just wish 
they didn’t protest like that,” 
what 
they’re 
really 
saying 

is “I acknowledge an issue 
exists, but I’m not willing to do 
anything to solve it because it 
doesn’t affect me.” As a result, 
demonstrators are forced to 
use “obstructive” methods — 
blocking roads, holding sit-ins 

and interrupting the status 
quo — to ensure people actually 
listen 
to 
them. 
Otherwise, 

their message would likely be 
ignored by the apathetic masses 
who prioritize their day-to-
day convenience above the 
issues affecting marginalized 
communities.

Martin 
Luther 
King 
Jr. 

famously 
wrote 
about 
this 

in his 1963 “Letter from a 
Birmingham 
Jail.” 
In 
the 

essay, King argued moderates 
who sit idly by and allow 
oppression to happen (despite 
being ostensibly against racism 
and discrimination), are more 
dangerous 
than 
Klansmen. 

Those “more devoted to ‘order’ 
than to justice; who (prefer) 
a negative peace which is the 
absence of tension to a positive 
peace which is the presence of 
justice; who constantly say, ‘I 
agree with you in the goal you 
seek, but I cannot agree with 
your methods of direct action’” 
present the greatest danger to 
those seeking equality. This is 
just as true today as it was half 
a century ago.

All of this begs an important 

question: How will you be 
remembered 
by 
history? 

While it was acceptable to 
be 
against 
the 
civil rights 

movement in the 1960s, pictures 
of 
counterprotesters 
standing 

outside of integrated schools 
draw disgust today. Anybody 
who currently thinks the civil 
rights activists were out of line is 
rightfully seen as bigoted — and I 
firmly believe 50 years from now, 
critics of today’s campaigns for 
racial equality will be seen in the 
same light. Now is your chance to 
stand on the right side of history, 
even if you have to stand alone.

Over two centuries ago, the 

United States’ Founding Fathers 
convened in Philadelphia to 
lay out a framework for the 
budding nation. The result 
was the construction of our 
Constitution — the brainchild 
of many men, all with different 
philosophies and visions for the 
future of the nation. However, 
they shared a reservation for 
unrestrained 
dominion 
like 

that of the British monarch that 
once reigned over them. The 
Declaration of Independence 
asserted “that all men are 
created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with 
certain 
unalienable 
rights,” 

and 
the 
Anti-Federalists, 

those wary of executive power, 
insisted that a Bill of Rights 
be added to the Constitution 
following 
its 
ratification 

that 
ensured 
the 
certain 

liberties of the people would 
not be infringed upon by the 
government.

In contemporary political 

discourse, 
there 
exists 
a 

debate regarding one of the 
most sacred rights enshrined 
in the Constitution. The First 
Amendment states, “Congress 
shall make no law… abridging 
the 
freedom 
of 
speech.” 

Although these words have 
protected the rights of white 
men since its inception, the 
Bill of Rights has not always 
protected those of minorities. 
Enslaved Americans were not 
viewed as human beings with 
God-given autonomy like their 
White 
counterparts. 
They 

were considered property, and 
the law, whether it be in spirit 
or in practice, affirmed their 
objectification. Only within the 
past century has the Supreme 
Court (arguably) fully avouched 
the equal rights of minorities.

Still, the right of Black 

people 
to 
express 
disdain 

for a government they see as 
repressive 
is 
under 
attack. 

Ex-49ers 
quarterback 
Colin 

Kaepernick’s national anthem 
protest has incensed masses 
of white Americans. “I am 

not going to stand up to show 
pride in a flag for a country 
that oppresses black people and 
people of color,” Kaepernick 
declared. “To me, this is bigger 
than football and it would be 
selfish on my part to look the 
other way. There are bodies in 
the street and people getting 
paid leave and getting away 
with 
murder.” 
The 
United 

States clearly has an issue 
with the unjust murder of 
Black people by the police, and 
Kaepernick is using his voice 

and his Constitutional right to 
do so, to shed light on it. But 
apparently Black people that 
take a stand on Black issues do 
not have the same rights.

Our 
president, 
in 
an 

unhinged tirade this past week, 
asked his crowd of adoring 
fans if they would, “love to 
see one of these NFL owners, 
when 
somebody 
disrespects 

our flag… say, ‘Get that son 
of a bitch off the field right 
now ... He’s fired. He’s fired!’” 
Coincidentally, Kaepernick is 
unemployed despite, in many 
people’s opinion, possessing 

the necessary skills to remain 
competitive 
in 
the 
league. 

Though some dispute this and 
argue that he is not the player he 
once was, many are questioning 
whether he would be on the 
field now had he not stuck 
to his protest. One of those 
people is ESPN host Jemele 
Hill, who also came under fire 
from the White House for her 
words. In a series of tweets, 
Hill professed that, “Donald 
Trump is a white supremacist 
who has largely surrounded 
himself 
w/ 
other 
white 

supremacists.” 
In 
response, 

White House Press Secretary 
Sarah Huckabee Sanders went 
out and suggested that ESPN 
should fire Hill. The president 
also took to Twitter to demand 
an apology. Conservatives all 
over the country have vowed to 
protest ESPN for its decision to 
keep Hill.

This is the president that 

doubled down on his support 
for the white supremacists and 
neo-Nazis that wreaked havoc 
at a Klan rally in Charlottesville, 
Va., this summer that led to the 
death of an innocent counter-
protester. In defiance of his 
own 
advisers’ 
advice, 
the 

condemnation of racism from 
leaders of his own party and 
decades-old political norms, 
he suggested that there were, 
“some very fine people on both 
sides.” Far-right commentators 
also 
rushed 
condemn 
the 

violence, but insinuated that 
white supremacists, too, have 
First Amendment rights to 
speech and assembly.

Are you sensing a pattern?
It 
wouldn’t 
matter 
that 

Hill, Kaepernick or any of the 
many other Black dissenters 
villainized in today’s society 
are chastised, if those that 
spout hatred and racism were 
chastised too, specifically from 
the President of the United 
States. However, this isn’t the 
case. The Constitution grants 
freedom of speech as a right for 
all, and the days of Black rights 
being second-class rights are 
over. Agree with our positions 
or not, Black people still have 
the right to have them — and 
take a stand, or a knee.

To me, this is 
bigger than 
football and 
it would be 
selfish on my 
part to look 

the other 
way. There 
are bodies 
in the street 
and people 
getting paid 

leave and 

getting away 
with murder. 

2017: Wake up, Michigan

SILAN FADLALLAH

MiC Contributor

The year is 1619. Colonists 

in 
Jamestown 
referred 
to 

African slaves as n*****s.

The year is 2017. A white 

male 
refers 
to 
a 
Black 

University 
of 
Michigan 

student as a n*****.

On 
Sunday, 
the 
door 

decorations of three Black 
students 
in 
a 
residential 

hall were vandalized with 
the 
N-word 
and 
other 

derogatory 
racial 
slurs. 

The 
administration 
did 

nothing but send out a vague 
letter 
acknowledging 
what 

happened and stating that 
racism is not tolerated at 
the 
University. 
Supposedly 

a 
police 
investigation 
is 

being conducted, but almost 
one 
week 
later 
we 
still 

have nothing. No response. 
No 
concrete 
information. 

Nothing. The University has 
done nothing but attempt 
to calm us down and assure 
us 
that 
they 
are 
“doing 

everything possible” to find 
out who vandalized the signs 
in 
West 
Quad 
Residence 

Hall. Actions speak louder 
than words, University of 
Michigan. We want action. We 
want names. We want change.

In 
response 
to 
the 

University’s lack of response, 
students held a protest in 
the 
Michigan 
Union 
on 

Thursday, starting at 7:30 
p.m. Students rallied in the 
Rogel Ballroom along with 
CSG members and members of 
the administration, Schlissel 
included. 
Black 
students 

shared their demands and 
concerns 
with 
Schlissel 

but, ultimately, nothing was 
resolved. 
Schlissel 
had 
to 

leave for familial reasons that 
seemed unclear.

Students 
then 
gathered 

outside of the Union and 
marched to Schlissel’s house. 
White allies were used to 
block 
off 
the 
crosswalks 

so 
protesters 
could 
pass 

through. A white male, who 
clearly felt that his driving 
through State Street was more 
important than the safety of 
our students, got out of his 
car and started shouting at 
the protesters. A Black male 
argued back at him to which 
the white male retorted and 

called the student a n*****. 
A fight broke out and the 
police so kindly and too gently 
escorted the white male away 
from the scene.

The year is 2017.
When 
will 
our 
society 

understand that present time 
is not 1619? That racism was 
and will never be OK? That 
the University of Michigan 
should refrain from accepting 
students 
that 
possess 
the 

audacity and ignorance that 
allow them to make another 
student feel unsafe in their 
own home? Racism is not just 
a Black people problem, nor 
is it strictly a POC problem — 
racism is everyone’s problem. 
The privileges granted to an 
individual as a result of their 
identity should not mean that 
they are permitted to turn 
a blind eye to the countless 
issues that plague our society. 
Our student body can only 
do so much. It is time for the 
University 
administration 

to step up and give us the 
justice we deserve. What the 
University’s values deserve. 
Stop 
the 
hate. 
End 
the 

violence. Wake up, University 
of Michigan.

If they are smart, 

I am dumb; if 

they are wealthy, 
I am poor; if they 
are the standard 
of beauty, and I 
am missing the 
slender nose, the 
straight blone hair 
and the blue eyes, 
what does it make 

me?


W

ith the election of 
Donald 
Trump, 

students 
have 

been getting more involved 
in 
activism. 
From 
the 

Women’s 
March 
the 
day 

after the election, to A Day 
Without Immigrants, to the 
March for Science in the 
spring, to the marches and 
phone 
banking 
following 

the president’s decision to 
rescind 
Deferred 
Action 

for 
Childhood 
Arrivals, 

students have been partaking 
in 
activism 
at 
campuses 

across the United States. In 
the 2011-12 school year, 11.1 
percent 
of 
undergraduate 

students in the United States 
had some type of disability. 
With such a large percentage 
of students dealing with a 
disability, 
it 
is 
important 

that activist groups make 
their events accessible to 
disabled students by creating 
a respectful and welcoming 
environment and improving 
infrastructure at events.

The 
biggest 
issue 
with 

mainstream activism is not a 
lack of representation; rather, 
it is misrepresentation. Even 
if intentions are good, the 
way those with disabilities 
are portrayed in activism 
can 
be 
problematic. 
A 

common form of this type of 
misrepresentation 
is 
from 

the “hero and pity” narrative. 
For 
example, 
we 
often 

see the story of “the hero 
who, despite their hideous 
impairment, was able to get 
into the Paralympics.” This 
“hero and pity” narrative 
creates a negative sentiment 
that suggests that having a 
disability is the worst thing 
that could happen to a person.

Halimat 
Olaniyan, 
the 

president of Disability Studies 
and Other Identity Politics at 
the University of Michigan, 
a 
student 
organization 

aimed 
toward 
representing 

disability 
narratives 
and 

facilitating 
discussions 
on 

intersectionality 
within 
the 

disabled 
community, 
echoes 

this 
sentiment. 
“Oftentimes 

people glorify successful people 
with disabilities, and that’s 
problematic,” Olaniyan said.

When this narrative appears 

in activism, it not only does 

a disservice to those activist 
groups, but makes their groups 
less accessible to those with 
disabilities 
by 
pushing 
a 

narrative in which the disabled 
don’t feel respected.

Problematic allyship is also 

an issue within mainstream 
activism. While the intentions 
of allies are usually good, it 
is important that they stay 
in the background — to be as 
supportive as possible without 
it becoming patronizing — 
rather than try to speak for 
the 
disabled 
community. 

This way, disabled folks can 
advocate for themselves and 
can feel more comfortable at 
activist events.

Social 
media 
showcase 

problematic 
activism. 
“It’s 

really hard, with Facebook 
and 
sites 
like 
that 
just 

being a big part of our lives. 
Oftentimes you have — not 
fake allies, that’s not the 
correct way to say it — but you 
have people going out of their 
way to, say, take a picture 
with someone who is disabled 
or take a picture that makes it 
look like they’re helping this 
person and turning the issue 
into something about them,” 
Olaniyan said.

It 
is 
possible 
to 
make 

activism 
more 
accessible 

to those with disabilities. 
Bettering infrastructure at 
events is the most concrete 
way 
of 
making 
activism 

accessible. Infrastructure can 
mean making sure there are 
adequate ways for those with 
disabilities to get to the event 
venue and attend the event 
comfortably. An example of 
improving 
infrastructure 

is having an American Sign 
Language 
interpreter 
to 

translate any speakers the 
event has for those who are 

deaf or hard of hearing and 
know ASL.

Activists 
can 
also 
take 

advantage of the internet 
to make their events more 
accessible 
to 
those 
with 

disabilities by livestreaming 
their events on social media. 
In 
January, 
the 
Women’s 

March on Washington paired 
up with the Disability March. 
The Disability March was an 
online-only march for those 
who could not make it to 
the Women’s March because 
of a disability or chronic 
illness. On its website, the 
Disability 
March 
allowed 

marchers 
to 
enter 
their 

stories surrounding disability 
or chronic illness, either from 
themselves or from someone 
they love. By including these 
types of services, activist 
groups can make their events 
more accessible.

Accessibility 
also 
means 

inclusivity. Arranging for more 
disabled speakers is key to 
making events more inclusive. 
This 
doesn’t 
just 
include 

disabled speakers at disability 
rights events but at events for 
LGBTQ rights events, events 
for racial justice and other 
issues. 
“It’s 
really 
moving 

to the affected communities 
(to see a disabled speaker),” 
Olaniyan affirmed. “It’s like, 
wow, I can do that too.”

Moving 
toward 

intersectionality 
in 
activism 

is 
an 
important 
step 
in 

incorporating diverse narratives 
in modern activism. Activists 
with disabilities fight for more 
than just disability issues. Many 
disabled activists are also queer, 
people of color or transgender, 
and 
they 
have 
important 

contributions to conversations 
surrounding those topics.

Nonviolent activism is an 

effective method of protest 
that can generate positive 
change in the United States. 
To have the largest impact 
possible, activist groups need 
to consider all people who 
want to partake in activism 
when planning their events. It 
is possible to create activism 
that includes all, regardless 
of ability or health.

I 

have not yet read Hillary

book 
“What 

Happened.” I’m sure I’ll 

get around to it eventually, 
and I trust I’m not 
missing 
anything 

earth-shattering 
in 
the 
meantime. 

Some of it will be 
thought-provoking, 
other parts mind-
numbing. Of the bits 
and pieces that have 
made headlines to 
this point, though, 
one 
passage 
has 

already managed to 
make my blood boil.

The 
former 
presidential 

candidate 
wrote: 
“Crowds 

at Trump rallies called for 
my 
imprisonment 
more 

times than I can count. They 
shouted, 
‘Guilty! 
Guilty!’ 

like the religious zealots in 
‘Game of Thrones’ chanting 
‘Shame! Shame!’ while Cersei 
Lannister walked back to the 
Red Keep.”

To be clear, my displeasure 

with this passage has nothing 
to do with my obsession with 
“Game of Thrones,” nor does 
it have anything to do with my 
opinion of Hillary Clinton. It 
has everything to do with my 
disgust for a habit in which 
too many of my fellow campus 
liberals 
have 
indulged, 
a 

kind of storybook politics 
that flattens political figures 
into fictional characters and 
attempts to remove all nuance 
from 
current 
events. 
It 

recasts political opponents as 
supervillains or evil dragons 
to be slain, simultaneously 
elevating a selected pantheon 
of like-minded politicians to 
the status of beloved heroes, 
equipped with a shiny set 
of armor and a sword. You’d 
think Hillary Clinton would 
be familiar with it by now.

A certain degree of this 

manner of political positioning 
is to be expected, of course. 
Often 
the 
easiest 
way 
to 

appear 
principled, 
caring 

and thoughtful is to paint the 
opposition 
as 
thoughtless, 

apathetic hypocrites. But what 
sets this framing aside is its 
blatant immaturity.

On Nov. 9, 2016, hundreds 

of disappointed Clinton voters 
flocked to Twitter and began 
a 
barrage 
of 
comparisons 

between Donald Trump and 
Voldemort, the fictional villain 
of the Harry Potter universe. 
Putting aside the fact that this 
comparison 
trivializes 
the 

very real effect his election has 
had on immigrants, Muslims, 
women, LGBTQ communities 
and the uninsured (not a 
fictional population of witches 
and wizards), it broadcasts 
to 
the 
lowest 
common 

denominator. 
“Politics 
are 

complicated,” it seems to say. 
“We prefer a straightforward 
narrative structure with a good 

guy and a bad guy.”

This was far from 

an isolated incident. 
In the two years since 
Trump 
announced 

his 
candidacy 
for 

the 
Republican 

nomination, he has 
been 
compared 
to 

Voldemort, 
Dolores 

Umbridge, 
Darth 

Vader, the Penguin 
from 
Batman, 

Dr. 
Evil, 
Joffrey 

Baratheon, 
a 
James 
Bond 

villain and Jabba the Hutt. 
Hillary Clinton benefited in 
part from purported likenesses 
to characters like Hermione 
Granger, Leslie Knope and 
Princess 
Leia. 
Too 
many 

Democratic 
primary 
voters 

got caught up online last year 
debating a contrived analogy 
in which Bernie Sanders was 
the kindly old wizard Gandalf, 
Hillary Clinton was Saruman 
and Donald Trump was Sauron. 
Some of these comparisons 
may be fairer than others; I 
personally couldn’t care less.

What’s 
exceedingly 

problematic, however, is that 
a fundamental change takes 
place when this association 
comes into play. No one sits 
down and considers why they 
root against the Joker; you root 
against him simply because 
he’s evil. By the same token, 
when “Saturday Night Live” 
portrays 
Steve 
Bannon 
as 

the Grim Reaper, one doesn’t 
think much further than the 
dark hood and the sickle.

Furthermore, 
these 

narratives tend to elevate a 
hero, some likable protagonist 
who comes along to act as the 
champion of the downtrodden 
and slay the beast. Politicians, 
though, make bad heroes, and 
our relationship with them 
is 
constantly 
questioned. 

Barack 
Obama 
enjoyed 
a 

semi-immediate canonization 
from 
millions 
of 
liberal 

Americans as he left office, 
and they cried out for four 
more years without a second 
thought about how they may 
disagree with his policies 
on 
immigration 
(deporting 

more people than any other 
president 
in 
history) 
and 

the Middle East (furthering 
American imperialism with 
an egregious expansion of 
U.S. drone programs). But 
such liberal sins are absolved, 
out of sight and out of mind, 
a small price to pay for the 
peace of mind that is waking 
up in the morning knowing 
there’s 
a 
hero 
out 
there 

somewhere.

The 
clear 
danger 
this 

phenomenon 
presents 
is 

a kind of infantile hyper-
partisanship, allowing people 
to shirk their responsibilities 
as voters to be skeptical, 
to 
constantly 
interrogate 

their support of this or that 
candidate. 
Being 
a 
well-

informed 
and 
thoughtful 

political 
observer 
takes 

exponentially more research, 
consideration 
and 
self-

reflection than it does to 
choose which character you 
want to see sitting on the 
Iron Throne or winning the 
Hunger Games.

When we see the opposition 

as morally deficient or wholly 
corrupt and the candidate we 
voted for in the last election 
as a hero in any sense of 
the word, our allegiances 
become dangerously blurred, 
associated 
more 
so 
with 

personalities rather than a set 
of values. It seems, though, as 
if the majority of Americans 
currently prefer to continue 
self-identifying with Bernie 
or Hillary (meanwhile the 
intra-party 
divisions 
have 

been far more complicated 
than 
this 
false 
binary), 

with Trump or against him. 
Identifying 
our 
personal 

position on health care falls 
behind the need to call a win 
for our heroes.

Ultimately, the effect is not 

isolated to the individual but 
bleeds into their supporters. 
Not only is the opposition the 
enemy, but so is anyone who 
has ever supported the enemy. 
How could they ever vote for 
such a villain and how are we 
supposed to respond to such 
an unforgivable sin? Once a 
Death Eater, always a Death 
Eater, no?

For a sizable cohort of young 

Twitter users (and whoever 
helped Hillary Clinton write 
her book), it seems like the 
world 
has 
shed 
its 
third 

dimension. A political climate 
that 
is 
frequently 
taxing, 

often invalidating and always 
unpredictable 
has 
become 

manageable, at the cost of 
nuance. Enough. Your political 
opponents aren’t fictional and 
the person you voted for isn’t 
a savior. These comparisons to 
pop culture, though sometimes 
amusing, are a colossal waste 
of 
time 
and 
cheapen 
the 

political process. Resist the 
temptation to engage with 
them, to debate them, to 
introduce them yourself. The 
mild chuckle you might get 
from comparing senators to 
the cast of “Stranger Things” 
isn’t worth it.

Emily Huhman can be reached at 

huhmanem@umich.edu.

I 

knew long before this 
weekend how I felt about 
kneeling 
during 
the 

national anthem. Whether I 
like it or not, it’s a right and 
a privilege of living in this 
nation to protest peacefully. I 
was lucky enough to be born 
in the United States, and I can 
say without a doubt that there 
is no other place I would 
rather call home.

But protest is an integral 

part of our nation’s character, 
and 
often 
how 
we 
set 

ourselves as a country onto 
a better moral path. After 
all, it’s hard to fix something 
unless you acknowledge that 
it’s broken. Even if this is the 
best country in the world, it 
would be wholly un-American 
not to want to make it better.

That’s not to say that I don’t 

understand why some people 
are upset when players kneel. 
I do, especially when the 
debate is framed as a matter 
of respect for our veterans. It 
seems that, somewhere along 
the line, the flag and the 
national anthem transformed 
from symbols of something 
into that something. Some 
of my friends and my fellow 
citizens are insistent that 
you cannot be a patriot, a 
supporter of veterans or 
even an American unless you 
stand during the national 
anthem. 
(Don’t 
like 
this 

country? Leave.)

I would agree with them 

if 
this 
were 
truly 
about 

veterans. If Colin Kaepernick, 
the man responsible for first 
kneeling in protest during the 
national anthem, started this 
controversy by saying that he 
was protesting our veterans, 
I doubt this would be such a 
nuanced issue. Saying “I hate 
veterans” isn’t going to get 
you very far in a debate.

However, it should be noted 

that saying “I like people 
who weren’t captured” will 
land you in the Oval Office. 
So, if you’re not ready for 
the responsibility of being 
president 
of 
the 
United 

States, don’t come out against 
prisoners of war. And if 
respect for veterans is of the 
utmost importance to you, 
perhaps voting for such a man 
isn’t in line with your values. 
But neither of those quotes can 
be attributed to Kaepernick. In 
fact, the issue at hand in these 
protests is police brutality, 
specifically, 
and 
systemic 

racism in general.

No matter which side you 

stand 
on 
regarding 
these 

issues — whether you believe 
those are things of the past 
or problems to this day — 
discourse is only ever helpful 
to a nation’s progress. A lack 
of discourse, a desire not to 
talk about something, is often 
a sign of weakness.

Part of what makes this 

issue so baffling to me is that 
this was one of the first issues 
addressed by Kaepernick to 
the press when asked about 
his feelings toward veterans:

“I have great respect for 

the men and women that 
have fought for this country,” 
Kaepernick 
said. 
“I 
have 

family, I have friends that 
have gone and fought for this 
country. And they fight for 
freedom, they fight for the 
people, they fight for liberty 
and justice, for everyone. 
That’s not happening. People 
are dying in vain because this 
country isn’t holding their 
end of the bargain up, as far 
as giving freedom and justice, 
liberty to everybody.”

Whether 
you 
kneel 
or 

stand, 
let’s 
choose 
this 

as a departing point: Our 

veterans deserve respect, and 
our citizens deserve better. 
Yes? I hope that my fellow 
countrymen who voted to 
“Make America Great Again” 
can get behind that second 
clause as something other 
than misguided, snowflake, 
liberal propaganda.

I titled this piece “Should 

I kneel?” for a reason. I am 
not telling you to kneel. 
Kaepernick is not asking you 
to kneel, even if many people 
are demanding you stand. 
I ask myself this because 
I feel a responsibility to 
contribute to my community 
in some way.

Nobody 
cares, 
frankly, 

whether I stand or kneel. 
I’m a college student. I’m 
not a professional athlete, I 
don’t make millions. What 
I say and what I do does not 
make headlines. So how do 
I 
participate? 
Hopefully, 

by writing this article, by 
sparking 
conversations 

about this issue in a way 
that doesn’t spark fights. I’m 
not looking for a fight, but I 
can’t shy away from a chance 
to talk about something that 
matters very much to the 
quality of life for many here 
in our country.

I refuse to believe that 

being critical of my country 
is incompatible with loving 
it. That’s not a choice I have 
to make. I can respect our 
veterans, stand for change 
and celebrate what is already 
great all at the same time. 
Let’s get rid of the idea that 
you have to choose. This wall 
is not insurmountable. We 
have enough in common as 
Americans to get past this.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Thursday, September 28, 2017

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

xwordeditor@aol.com

There’s a distinct noise in 

sports when a crowd gets the 
life taken out of it.

It usually starts with a gasp, 

before 
transitioning 
into 
a 

deafening silence. Whether it’s 
a local Little League crowd or 
a crowd of 110,000 at Michigan 
Stadium, 
the 
noise 
is 
the 

same, and it never means that 
something good has happened 
to the home side.

Austin 
Ricci, 
a 
senior 

forward 
from 
Oakland 

University, produced that noise 
on Wednesday night at U-M 
Soccer Stadium, where the 
Golden Grizzlies beat the No. 
20 Michigan men’s soccer team, 
2-1.

In the 49th minute, Ricci 

tied the game at one on a goal 
defined more by the Wolverines’ 
sloppiness than anything else. It 
came off a bouncing ball toward 
Michigan’s goal that didn’t 
seem especially threatening. 
Sophomore goalkeeper Andrew 
Verdi came out to get the ball, 
but Ricci’s head connected with 
it before he could. After a first 
half in which the Wolverines 
dominated, the equalizer felt 

more like a punch to the gut.

Michigan opened the scoring 

early, with a Mohammed Zakyi 
header 
just 
seven 
minutes 

into the game. The freshman 
forward whipped the ball in 
off a 35-yard free kick from a 
fellow 
freshman, 
midfielder 

Marc Ybarra. In the early part 
of the game, it 
felt like the first 
of many.

Freshman 

midfielder 
Jackson 
Ragen 

nearly 
scored 

off a free kick 
in 
similar 

fashion 
just 

seven 
minutes 

later, 
however, 

his 
header 

flew wide. The 
floodgates 
seemed ready to 
open.

In the 20th minute, Michigan 

generated another chance in 
what, at that point, seemed 
like an endless line of them. It 
was another Zakyi header, this 
one after a cross from junior 
midfielder Robbie Mertz. But 
Golden Grizzly keeper Sullivan 
Lauderdale saved it.

Even 
without 
juniors 

Marcello Borges and Francis 
Atuahene – the former injured, 
the latter suspended – the 
Wolverines looked set to cruise. 
That dream ended with Ricci, 
as the ball trickled into the 
back of the net just minutes 
into the second half. Senior 
defender 
Billy 
Stevens 
and 

Verdi both went 
down 
on 
the 

play, staying on 
the ground for a 
few minutes as 
trainers tended 
to them, adding 
to 
Michigan’s 

despondency. 
Though 
they 

stayed 
in 
the 

game, 
the 

Wolverines 
never 
regained 

momentum.

After 

Oakland’s first goal, the game 
stayed tied for just 15 minutes 
until the Golden Grizzlies hit 
paydirt again. Coming forward 
on a counterattack, forward 
Travis 
Harrington 
threaded 

a 
pass 
through 
Michigan’s 

defense. 
Midfielder 
Jacob 

Moore provided the finish.

“For two or three mistakes 

in the second half we looked 
really 
loosey-goosey,” 
said 

Michigan head coach Chaka 
Daley. “We addressed some 
things at halftime and they still 
continued to rear their head in 
the second half. Our clearances 
weren’t great, our cover wasn’t 
necessarily great. So I think 
those are two reasons we 
conceded.”

Michigan didn’t go down 

quietly, though. As time wound 
down, a Wolverine onslaught 
ensued. In the game’s last five 
minutes, Michigan had four 
shots. None found the back of 
the net.

The most threatening was 

the last – a Zakyi header that 
forced a diving save from 
Lauderdale with 19 seconds left 
in the game. When the clock 
struck zero, Michigan had lost 
its first game to Oakland in 
Daley’s tenure as head coach, 
and their third in four games.

“(The loss) does not deter 

me in any way, shape or form,” 
Daley said. “I’m disappointed 
for 
sure, 
but 
it 
doesn’t 

determine my confidence in our 
team, in our leaders, in what I 
think we’re capable of, in what’s 
remaining in the season and 
what I think can be attainable.”

Coming off a last-place finish in its 

previous tournament, the Michigan 
women’s golf team looked to avenge 
its performance at the Golfweek 
Conference Challenge in Vail, Colo. 
this week.

The Wolverines finished the three-

day, stroke play event in 10th place 
out of an 18-team field. And while 
that was certainly a substantial 
improvement, Michigan failed to 
seize an opportunity to place higher.

The Wolverines got off to a strong 

start, 
leading 
the 
field 
through 

Sunday. 
They 
couldn’t 
keep 
up, 

however, and steadily collapsed over 
the course of the tourney.

During the opening round on 

Sunday, junior Elodie Van Dievoet 
took charge of the field, finishing 
in first place at three-under 69. 
Van 
Dievoet’s 
performance 
was 

impressive from the start as she 
birdied five out of her first six holes, 
giving the Wolverines the spark they 
needed. Michigan finished the day 
with 19 birdies as a team.

“We go to every tournament to win 

it,” said Michigan coach Jan Dowling. 
“We put ourselves in contention to do 
that, so that’s a positive.”

Freshman Ashley Kim, in her 

second college tournament, shot an 
even-par 72, ending at 13th. Other 
Wolverines carded solid rounds as 
well, putting Michigan in a tie for 
second place with a 290 — just one 
stroke back from the leader, San 
Diego State.

The Wolverines couldn’t repeat 

that performance Monday, ending 
with a 303 and falling into a tie for 
fifth.

Senior Emily White led Michigan 

with a 74 on Monday, but it simply 
wasn’t enough for the Wolverines to 
hold their ground. Her teammates 

didn’t do anything spectacular, either. 
Van Dievoet shot a 76, failing to fend 
off the competition and losing her 
lead. She moved into a tie for eighth, 
while Michigan’s other golfers carded 
substandard rounds.

Despite coming back with a 295 in 

the final round on Wednesday, the 
Wolverines continued to plummet 
on the leaderboard. They finished 
in 10th with a grand total of 888, 16 
strokes behind the champion, Denver.

Van Dievoet was off to a shaky start 

and was six-over through her first 
eight holes of the final round. After 
settling down and finding her groove, 
she went on to birdie three straight 
holes.

But 
that 

wasn’t all — Van 
Dievoet eagled a 
long, 
505-yard 

par 5 a couple 
holes 
later, 

and 
she 
even 

managed to tack 
on 
one 
more 

birdie 
before 

the 
round 

ended. 
She 

finished 
tied 

for 11th with a 
217. It was quite 
the 
comeback 

considering the 
brutal start.

“We 
are 

obviously doing 
some 
things 

really well, and 
it shows what 
our 
potential 

is,” 
Dowling 

said. “But at the 
same time, we 
didn’t 
handle 

the 
lead 
very 

well the last few 
days.”

White tallied 

a 74 to finish in 

26th while Ashley Kim finished 51st. 
Seniors Kathy Lim and Megan Kim 
were in Michigan’s lineup as well, 
finishing 38th and 62nd, respectively.

While it wasn’t smooth sailing 

for the Wolverines, they still made 
progress. They showed glimpses of 
top-notch play throughout the week. 
The next step, it appears, will be 
finding consistency.

“Our ball striking is pretty good. … 

We are gonna mostly focus on short 
game,” Dowling said. “We’ve got two 
big weeks to get ready. We’ve got two 
really strong tournaments coming up 
in October, and I know the team is 
pretty pumped to get after it and get 
better before we tee it up again.”

A 
loud 
roar 
exploded 

from the stands of one side 
at the U-M Soccer Stadium, 
overpowering the other side’s 
sparse, sad groans. 

The Michigan men’s soccer 

team (2-1-1 Big Ten, 5-3-2 
overall) took on Oakland on 
Wednesday and left what little 
fans who attended as the latter 
of the two sides. 

The Oakland fans’ energy, 

in a way, paralleled the energy 
of their players in the Golden 
Grizzlies’ 2-1 win over the 
Wolverines, who missed a lot 
more than just their fans on a 
chilly Ann Arbor night.

One of the most noticeable 

things 
Michigan 
lacked 

tonight was expertise. Junior 
defender 
Marcello 
Borges 

was missing. So was junior 
forward Francis Atuaheneone 
— of the Wolverines’ better 
scorers — because of a red card 
he obtained in the last match 
against Northwestern.

“We’re the walking wounded 

right now,” said Michigan head 
coach Chaka Daley. “We don’t 
have a lot of available bodies, 
we had a suspension and three 

major players on the bench for 
our team. I still think we could 
have maybe gotten more out of 
the game, but unfortunately 
didn’t.”

For the first half though, 

expertise 
didn’t 
seem 
to 

matter. Freshman midfielder 
Marc Ybarra continued his 
strong play when he connected 
on a free kick from 35 feet out 
to fellow freshman forward 
Mohammed Zakyi in the box. 
Ybarra continued to hit his 
teammates accurately on set 
pieces throughout the first 
half.

In the end, the Wolverines’ 

inability to score late in the 
first half hurt their momentum, 
and so, perhaps, did all of 
the team’s absences. Golden 
Grizzlies’ forward Austin Ricci 
popped in a header in the 49th 
minute. Fifteen minutes later, 
the player who assisted him, 
Nebosja Popovic, skimmed the 
ball over the Michigan back 
line for another goal.

“We were excellent in the 

first half, carried the game in 
every single capacity, every 
single way,” Daley said. 

Despite 
making 
halftime 

adjustments, Daley lamented 
how 
some 
of 
the 
same 

Wolverines’ 
problems 
still 

came up in the second half.

“We addressed some things 

at halftime and they still 
continue to rear their head in 
the second half,” Daley said. 
“Our clearances weren’t great, 
our cover wasn’t necessarily 
great. I think those are two 
reasons we conceded in the 
second half.”

Team captain Ivo Cerda 

echoed his coach’s sentiment. 
While the midfielder didn’t 
play the whole game, he played 
a large role in anchoring 
Michigan’s defense in the first 
half.

He shared his teammates’ 

and coach’s frustration with 
the blown lead, which clearly 
showed when he earned a 
yellow card in an end-of-game 
skirmish after an Oakland foul. 
Just like his coach, Cerda noted 
the team’s lack of discipline but 
expressed optimism towards 
gaining it back.

“Yeah, discipline is a big 

thing for us, especially with 
the types of calls we that we 
got today,” Cerda said. “The 
good thing about it is that if 
we can improve on that a lot, 
we should stay more focused 
throughout the whole game.”

A look around the Big Ten without Michigan

It seems like it’s been a year 

since redshirt freshman kicker 
Quinn Nordin hit those two 
50-yard field goals in Dallas. 

Yet it’s been just four weeks, 

and somehow — through a 
blur of scary moments and 
unsettling 
games 
— 
the 

Michigan football team (4-0) is 
still undefeated.

Now, 
the 
eighth-ranked 

Wolverines head into their bye 
week. Without a game until 
Oct. 7, the Daily looks outside 
Ann Arbor at the rest of the Big 
Ten.

Here’s a breakdown of what 

Michigan’s future opponents 
are up to this weekend:

Michigan State (2-1)
When 
do 
they 
play 

Michigan? Oct. 7

Next Opponent: Iowa (3-1)
Despite moving the ball for 

nearly 500 yards of offense, 
the Spartans were handed their 
first loss last weekend against 
Notre 
Dame. 
The 
Fighting 

Irish scored 21 points off three 
Michigan State turnovers (one 
pick-six 
and 
two 
fumbles), 

and in addition to giving up 97 
yards in penalties, the Spartans 
did little to help themselves. 

Michigan State quarterback 

Brian 
Lewerke, 
now 
a 

true 
sophomore, 
has 
four 

touchdowns 
and 
two 

interceptions 
this 
season. 

His next opponent, Iowa, has 
allowed nearly 250 passing 
yards every game, which is 
exactly what Lewerke averages 
so far. If the young Spartan 
quarterback 
cleans 
up 
the 

mistakes, 
Michigan 
State 

should be able to ride out a win 
at home before they come play 
at the Big House.

Indiana (2-1)
When 
do 
they 
play 

Michigan? Oct. 14

Next Opponent: No. 4 Penn 

State (4-0)

The Hoosiers inevitably got 

thrown to the bottom of the 
dog pile when they opened 
their 
season 
against 
Ohio 

State. Indiana has had two 
comfortable wins since playing 
the Buckeyes, but they’ve also 
become riddled with injuries.

Against a top-five team like 

Penn State, that will be an 
issue.

Quarterback Richard Lagow 

left last weekend’s game early 

with a leg injury, but the 
main cause for concern is on 
defense. 
The 
Hoosiers 
lost 

three starters in their win over 
Georgia Southern: cornerback 
A’Shon Riggins, defensive back 
Marcelino Ball and defensive 
tackle Nate Hoff.

All three are questionable 

for 
this 
weekend, 
which 

significantly 
reduces 
their 

chances against the Nittany 
Lions, who average 496 yards 
per game.

No. 4 Penn State (4-0)
When 
do 
they 
play 

Michigan? Oct. 21

Next Opponent: Indiana 

(3-1)

The 
Nittany 
Lions 
are 

living up to all the offseason 
hype since last year’s Rose 
Bowl, and the credit is due to 
running back Saquon Barkley. 
Though it’s still early in the 
season, Barkley is the Heisman 
frontrunner and a potential No. 
1 draft pick.

He 
leads 
his 
team 
in 

both rushing and receiving 
yards 
with 
518 
and 
335, 

respectively. Barkley has six 
total touchdowns — four on the 
ground and two in the passing 
game. Few teams, certainly not 
Indiana, will be able to stop 
him.

And even if a team can find 

a way to halt the running back, 
it would still have to deal 
with Penn State quarterback 
Trace McSorley. McSorley has 
thrown for over 1,000 yards 
and 10 touchdowns, completing 
66 percent of his passes.

It would take a miracle for 

a handful of Indiana second-
string 
defensive 
players 
to 

stop the runaway train that is 
Barkley, McSorley and Penn 
State.

Rutgers (1-3)
When 
do 
they 
play 

Michigan? Oct. 28

Next Opponent: No. 11 Ohio 

State (3-1)

It was actually a decent 

weekend by Rutgers’ standards 
during a 27-17 road loss to 
Nebraska. For starters, the 
Scarlet 
Knights 
didn’t 
get 

blown out. A pick-six from 
Rutgers defensive back Kiy 
Hester gave Rutgers a lead in 
the third quarter, but Nebraska 
rallied to come back for the 
win.

It was the Scarlet Knights’ 

15th consecutive Big Ten loss. 
No. 16 will likely come this 
Saturday against Ohio State.

Rutgers 
quarterback 

Kyle Bolin has thrown six 
interceptions and just three 

touchdowns 
so 
far. 
His 

performance 
might 
give 

true 
freshman 
quarterback 

Johnathan Lewis a fair amount 
of playing time against the 
Buckeyes.

Lewis, 
a 
dual-threat 

quarterback, 
handled 
the 

majority of the workload in 
Rutgers’ sole win over Morgan 
State, but besides that, he 
hasn’t taken many snaps.

Ohio States’ defense would be 

Lewis’ biggest test yet. But why 
not play him? There’s nowhere 
to go but up for Rutgers. 

Minnesota (3-0)
When 
do 
they 
play 

Michigan? November 4

Next Opponent: Maryland 

(2-1)

New coach P.J. Fleck has the 

boat rowing in Minneapolis. 
The Golden Gophers have won 
three straight games, including 
a dominant win over Pac-12 
opponent Oregon State.

The Golden Gophers’ best 

offensive threat is their depth 
in the run game. Running back 
Shannon Brooks leads the team 
with four rushing touchdowns, 
but Minnesota has done well 
in rotating the tailbacks. Its 
other running backs, Kobe 
McCrary and Rodney Smith, 
have over 100 yards on the 

season and have combined for 
four touchdowns between the 
two of them. 

Michigan’s former defensive 

coordinator 
D.J. 
Durkin 

coaches 
Minnesota’s 
next 

opponent, 
Maryland. 
The 

Gophers’ rush offense against 
the Terrapins’ rush defense 
should make for a decisive 
battle on Saturday.

Maryland (2-1)
When 
do 
they 
play 

Michigan? Nov. 11

Next Opponent: Minnesota 

(3-0)

It’s a bad year to be a 

quarterback at Maryland.

Just 
three 
weeks 
after 

starting quarterback Tyrrell 
Pigrome tore his ACL against 
Texas, the Terrapins’ backup, 
freshman Kasim Hill, suffered 
the same injury. Neither will 
return this season.

The injuries dampened what 

was once a great start to the 
2017 campaign, which included 
a big win on the road at then-
No. 23 Texas.

Now, the Terrapins will turn 

the reigns over to sophomore 
Max 
Bortenschlager, 
the 

only 
healthy 
scholarship 

quarterback left on the roster.

No. 10 Wisconsin (3-0)
When 
do 
they 
play 

Michigan? Nov. 18

Next 
Opponent: 

Northwestern (2-1)

True 
freshman 
running 

back Jonathan Taylor leads 
the Big Ten with five rushing 
touchdowns. 
He 
broke 
out 

against Florida Atlantic for 223 
rushing yards and three scores 
and followed that up with 
another 100-yard outing on the 
road against Brigham Young.

At quarterback, Wisconsin’s 

Alex Hornibrook has shown 
major improvements from last 
season.

Last 
year, 
Hornibrook 

threw nine touchdowns and 
seven interceptions with just 
a 58-percent completion rate. 
Through three games this year, 
he has eight touchdowns and 
only one interception and has 
completed 70 percent of his 
passes.

The Badgers are a 15.5-point 

favorite 
over 
Northwestern, 

and should come away with 
another big win if all goes 
according to plan. For a second 
straight year, the Big Ten West 
really is Wisconsin’s to lose.

No. 11 Ohio State (3-1)
When 
do 
they 
play 

Michigan? Nov. 25

Next Opponent: Rutgers 

(1-3)

Yes, the Buckeyes are going 

to beat Rutgers. See you next 
week.

Soon, sooner than most of us 

posters, scrollers, refreshers 
and general internet lurkers 
would like, Twitter is going to 
up its character count to 280 — 
double the current limit. And 
while that increases potential 
for 
memes 
and 
political 

screaming, 
it 
also 
affects 

a community of poets who 
use Twitter as their primary 

means of publication.

When Twitter first appeared 

on the web 11 years ago it was 
a space to talk about what you 
ate for breakfast. About 2011, 
people started to toss around 
the idea that the website might 
actually be — like most other 
text-based media before it — 
literary. That maybe it was 
possible to fit art, and more 
specifically 
poetry, 
within 

Twitter’s 
humble 
character 

limit. 
Poets 
established 
in 

print took to the site to be 
playful and human — to point 

out, with the sincerity of early 
internet culture, the beauty 
in toast and jam and bowls of 
cereal.

Poets like Mary Karr and 

Sherman 
Alexie 
used 
the 

platform to send blips of beauty 
into the web and to reaffirm 
a kind of canonical body — 
retweeting and quoting poetry 
from other, equally established 
poets. Poetry on Twitter was, 
in many ways, merely the 
transposition of pre-existing 
words.

For some poets, that kind 

of literary Twitter was more 
a means to talk about poetry 
than one to create it. Because 
the site, and specifically this 
sub-community, maintained a 
false air of professionalism and 
careerism, it became an echo 
chamber to reaffirm what was 
already established offline.

The internet was growing up 

quickly and it was becoming 
more and more apparent that 
instead of just a new platform, 
it was a new world that could 

house art and inspire it. From 
this world, a generation of 
posters and poets was born.

There has been resurgence 

in Twitter as a platform for 
organic and original creation. 
The origins of the alt-lit online 
community — which started 
on Tumblr and Twitter in 2011 
and came into its own as those 
platforms did, about 2014.

Alt-lit is literature on the 

internet that is a direct product 
of internet culture. In its earlier 
stages, it was poetry that was 
stylized to look internet-y — 

chat room messages, Facebook 
statuses, lowercase letters and 
abbreviations abound. It was 
characterized by a proximity 
to the “New Sincerity” literary 
movement that includes IRL 
writers 
like 
David 
Foster 

Wallace and Miranda July.

Online, 
poets 
like 
Steve 

Roggenbuck 
and 
Mira 

Gonzalez rose to prominence. 
Early on, they blurred the 
lines between self-deprecating 
observation 
and 
more 

traditionally 
recognizable 

poetry.

Both poets still use Twitter, 

as well as traditional print, 
as a means of spreading their 
poetry to the masses and 
bridging the gap between what 
can roughly be characterized 
as alt-lit and post-alt-lit. Yes, 
now, it’s a movement that 
is established enough to be 
considered in a post phase. 
Still alt, still lit, just post what 
it was before.

Like all the great “post”s, 

this iteration of internet poetry 

is interested in what poetry is 
as a concept and an institution. 
It’s funnier, sharper, more 
cynical and nihilistic.

Popular accounts intersperse 

their verse with memes and 
retweets from “weird Twitter” 
accounts like @dril. 

This brand of poetry is post 

New Sincerity’s rejection of 
postmodernism’s 
cynicism, 

which is just a convoluted way 
of saying it’s cynical again. 
But, cynical in a different 
way, a way that knows how to 
spin multiple plates — beauty, 

despair, self-deprecation, self-
love — all at once.

On Twitter, users like @

atreewithagrape 
and 
@

simulacra1990 and @RAF_i_A 
blend 
memes, 
political 

retweets and small lines of 
verse into poetic and holistic 
expressions of the self. Profiles 
are often devoid of real names, 
photos or other points of 
identification. Poets are known 
by their handles in a

“At home, there’s this little 

coffee shop … our friend owns 
it … his dad used to own it but 
he passed it down to his son, 
and his son is super chill and 
he’s like, ‘We need to start 
throwing 
shows 
here.’ 
So 

we threw a show,” said Alex 
Stoitsiadis, lead singer of a 
local Ann Arbor band, Dogleg, 
which also includes Chase 
Macinski on bass and Parker 
Grissom on drums.

“It went over really well. 

And then we threw another 
show at the end of summer and 
like 200 people showed up. In 
this little coffee shop, they all 
just piled in. And it was one 
of the craziest nights of our 
lives.”

It’s 
hard 
to 
describe 

exactly 
what 
the 
people 

in 
that 
impromptu 
venue 

heard when they saw Dogleg 
perform for the first time. 
As a band, they’ve developed 
a sound that’s difficult to 
pin down. A blend of driving 
energy, powerful vocals and 
instrumentation that leaves 
you speechless, Dogleg’s music 
dares you to try and neatly 

categorize it. The rush of color 
and catharsis that burst to 
life in that little coffee shop 
must have shaken the very 
foundations of the building: 
an aftermath of toppled-over 
chairs and cracked coffee cups.

It’s not surprising in the 

least to hear that such a large 
crowd came to watch the 
second performance.

The different elements in 

each of Dogleg’s songs are 
unrestrained, allowing their 
two albums to spark with a 

distinct dynamism. Songs are 
almost like scrapbooks in the 
way they are pieced together. 
“Star 
67” 
from 
Remember 

Alderaan? hangs off the edge 
of 
spiking 
crescendos 
and 

jagged vocals. The mellow 
intro of “11 AM Drunk” from 
Dogleg trips into a racing 
tempo that jolts toward the 
finish line. Untraditional but 
not amateurish, irregular but 
not haphazard, it’s art that is 
redefined.

It’s DIY.
Even 
though 
this 
very 

broad label can encompass a 
variety of different aspects, 
the importance of DIY comes 
in the fact that, at its core, 
it allows art to be malleable, 
deconstructing the unyielding 
stone 
of 
more 
traditional 

definitions in order for people 
to create their own systems of 
production. DIY is art at its 
most accessible and ingenuity 
at its finest. Still-life paintings 
can be made out of instant 
coffee and water. Movies can 
be filmed in backyards.

Music can be recorded in 

basements.

“Dogleg 
was 
just 
me, 

initially,” 
Stoitsiadis 
said 

as he explained the band’s 
beginning. 
“The 
friend 
of 

mine who was in the old band 
let me borrow his recording 
equipment, which was literally 
just a little box that could 
record two microphones at a 
time.

It wasn’t music production 

in the conventional sense, but 
it worked.

“I would just record stuff on 

there and just kind of make it 
as good as possible … just kind 
of working with the limits,” he 
said.

Even 
with 
limitations, 

Stoitsiadis found the feedback 
he 
received 
after 
publicly 

releasing his music to be 
overwhelmingly positive.

“I didn’t really expect (the 

music) to go anywhere,” he 
said. “I threw it out online 
and pretty soon people were 
really liking it a lot and I was 
like, ‘I should start playing 
shows. I should start actually 
mobilizing this thing.’”

Dogleg 
emerged 
from 

the inconspicuous form of a 
piece of borrowed recording 
equipment; 
Stoitsiadis’s 

ingenuity 
and 
passion 

empowered his music to grow 
into the established band it is 
today.

“My old friends, we went to 

music school together: School 
of Rock,” he said. “So I called 
them up … they’re itching 
to play in a band. So, we get 
together and everything just 
gels completely. We’re all on 
the same exact page as to what 
we want to do, where we want 
to go, how we want to sound 
and things just exponentially 
took off from there.”

Yet, even as Dogleg continue 

to branch out, the band never 
strays too far from Stoitsiadis’s 
original 
means 
of 
music 

production.

“I would go and write five 

different riff or song ideas, 
just in one day,” he explained. 
“And then the next day I would 
come back to them and see 
what can I change, what can I 
put together, what can I piece 
apart.”

It’s a casual process.
Even when writing vocals, 

the 
component 
that 
gives 

Stoitsiadis the most trouble 
during the creation of new

way that complicates the 

narrative of the internet as a 
void of narcissism. There’s an 
intentional 
and 
maintained 

level of anonymity that feels 
very 
akin 
to 
the 
mythic 

recluses 
and 
anonymously 

published poets of the print 
canon.

And online, a community 

has 
formed. 
Poets 
can 

communicate, 
read 
one 

another’s 
work 
and 
talk 

from across the globe. It’s 
a 
community 
that 
values 

authenticity, something that 
the medium often facilitates 
more 
than 
traditional 

print media. No editors, no 
publishers, all that stands 
between a poem and the world 
is a click.

Some 
poets, 
like 
@pds.

literate, 
use 
Instagram 
in 

a similar way. They post 
pictures, often screenshots 
from iPhone notes or stylized 
photo collages, of their poems. 
For many poets, the roots of 
this kind of publication are 
more based in street art and 
photography. Because Twitter 
poetry 
has 
historically 

favored canon or traditional 
poetry, Instagram is an outlet 
for poets who can sometimes 
feel left out or overwhelmed 
by the noise of Twitter.

The draw of these online 

platforms 
as 
opposed 

to 
traditional 
forms 
of 

publication — even small-
scale 
self-publication 
— 

for many young writers is 
the instant accessibility of 
their 
art. 
Publication 
is, 

realistically, a lot of work for 
little 
readership, 
whereas 

in an instant a tweet or an 
Instagram post is available 
to anyone with Wi-Fi. In that 
way, the internet actually 
becomes what Silicon Valley 
always dreamed it could be: a 
great equalizer.

Anyone who writes can be 

published and anyone who 
reads can come across poetry.

Some people think this is 

all just horrible narcissism. 
Poetry is just another thing 
for millennials to kill, to 
over-post it into oblivion. The 
self-awareness is seen as self-
absorption, and 140 characters 
— or 280 if you’re one of the 
lucky (or cursed) who got to 
use the boosted count in beta 
— just isn’t enough for a poem.

Twitter 
becomes 
a 

microcosm for the English 
language, 
which 
can 
be 

beautiful 
and 
stupid, 
and 

often both at once. This new 
wave of internet poets has 
seized on the possibilities, 
viewing every tweet as a poem 
or part of a poem.

Then, like in traditional 

print poetry, the reader is 
tasked with making sense of 
it. Is the individual tweet the 
poem or is it the whole feed? 
And, of course, the answer 
is both. The medium allows 
poets to publish their process, 
send words or phrases or 
sentences out into the world 
and see how readers respond 
to them — what they retweet 
and what they scroll past. The 
platform 
is 
revolutionizing 

the way people make and 
interact with poetry.

Internet 
poetry 
— 
like 

all worthwhile art — is an 
adventure in sifting through 
dirt (and sometimes shit) to 
find gold. The fact that the 
pile of dirt has grown doesn’t 
dim the gold’s glow.

It feels natural that people 

have taken this cold and 
detatched thing — Twitter, 
Instagram, the internet — and 
animated it with art. What 
could be more right than that?

songs, a rigid schedule is 

never set.

“I’ve always felt limited 

by writing vocals,” he said. 
“Writing 
words, 
I 
would 

just stay up until 3 a.m. until 
something came to me and 
something just came out and 
was like this is what sounds 
good 
here 
and 
it 
should 

happen.”

It’s a decisively informal 

creative 
process 
that 
fits 

Stoitsiadis’s 
style 
well, 

paralleling 
the 
decisively 

informal way he first started 
to make music.

However, while the method 

has remained constant, the 
way 
Stoitsiadis 
personally 

defines 
DIY 
music 
is 

something that has changed 
significantly over the years.

“When 
I 
first 
started,” 

he said, “DIY was sort of 
just doing it all by yourself… 
and kind of rejecting any 
help you can get. But, as I’ve 
kind of grown and the band 
has grown, and we’ve been 
exposed to this community 
of people who believe the 
same way; it’s kind of like now 
you’ve got to open yourself 
up to others and you’ve got to 
take inspiration from others 
and give inspiration to them.”

It’s a constructive back-and-

forth of ideas, a connection 
that seems integral to the 
expansion of DIY music.

Out of basements, living 

rooms 
and 
cafe 
corners, 

music is being made. It’s not 
perfect. Like all forms of art, 
it has its shortcomings. But 
no matter what your opinion 
is on this type of sound, there 
is no denying the passion and 

resourcefulness behind these 
underground explorations of 
artistic expression.

There is no denying the 

significance of bands like 
Dogleg. 
Especially 
during 

live shows, their preference 
to play smaller venues allows 
them to easily build a level of 
intimacy with the crowd.

“We always prefer to play 

houses,” Stoitsiadis said. “It 
just allows us to get close with 
the crowd and talk to people, 
like right after and during 
the show. And just be more 
connected.”

In addition, the way Dogleg 

genuinely seem to appreciate 
and become motivated by the 
support of listeners allows 
them, and potentially the rest 
of the DIY music community, 
to be seen as approachable.

“I 
think 
just 
knowing 

that somebody out there is 
listening to us,” he said, “and 
just like really connecting 
with us is what makes me keep 
wanting to write more songs.”

It’s this selfless gratitude 

that highlights the strength 
of groups like Dogleg; their 
dedication has the potential 
to influence others to strive 
and create similar DIY spaces 
in Ann Arbor.

Above all else, DIY art 

simply empowers creativity: 
the ability to take that initial

It’s an unassuming lot — 

that is, if you make it out 
there. Nestled in a quiet, hilly 
patch of various shades of 
green next to the Matthaei 
Botanical 
Gardens, 
seven 

miles from Central Campus, 
sit an un-showy few plots of 
land. Deftly manicured rows 
of crops, a full, working hoop 
house, an abundance of hoses 
watering plants — even though 
we’re definitely not on campus, 
this is the Campus Farm.

***

Founded in 2012 by a group of 

graduate students, the Campus 
Farm 
is 
a 
self-sustaining, 

student-run, year-round farm. 
There are 10 student managers 
that oversee almost all aspects 
of the operation, from planting 
to harvesting to distribution, 

and every Friday, about 40 
volunteers It’s one of those 
“Duh!” 
extracurriculars, 
if 

you get what I mean — you had 
never heard about it, but once 
you did, of course that makes 
sense.

Engineering 
junior 
Carly 

Sharp is one of those 10 student 
managers. She’s also in charge 
of 
coordinating 
volunteers 

for Volunteer Workdays every 
Friday.

“It’s 
a 
living-learning 

community, so the idea is to 
bring students out there to 
learn more about agriculture,” 
she said. “It’s meant to provide 
a space for students to get a 
chance to see where their food 
comes from and its impacts on 
the environment.”

The Campus Farm is funded 

by grants and donations, but 
as a model of sustainability, 
its recent Good Agricultural 
Practices 
certification 
has 

been a huge step forward for 
the program.

Previously, Campus Farm 

produce was sold to Argus 
Farm Stop (a local produce 
stop) or Student Food Co., 
or 
volunteers 
and 
student 

managers would take home 
what was left. In the past 
year, the program hired a full-
time manager to help achieve 
GAP certification, and ever 

since, the Campus Farm has 
sold much of its produce to 
the University dining halls 
and the Ross Business School 
Executive Suite.

“I feel like the cool thing 

about the farm selling to the 
dining halls is that it’s full 
circle, almost like we grow the 
food that we eat,” Sharp said. 
“We grow food for students, 
and the students that come out 
and volunteer grow food for 
other students.”

Katie 
Samra, 
another 

school yeat student manager, 
tells me that every Sunday 
at noon, when the Campus 
Farm sends out its emails 
detailing the harvest list for 
the coming week, MDining 
is often the first to respond, 
within a matter of minutes. 
The program even helped the 
University 
dining 
program 

achieve its goal of sourcing at 
least 25 percent of its produce 
from local, sustainable options.

***

As weekly volunteers mill 

about — some experienced 
gardeners and some first-time 
freshmen — student managers 
implore them to wash their 
hands. This is food to be 
harvested, bought and sold, 
after all.

Groups 
are 
made 
and 

volunteers are split up: Some 
will help with the weeding, 
some will help to clean up 
around the farm and some 
will 
actually 
help 
harvest 

the 
crops. 
The 
latter 
are 

then taken aside for a long 
instruction period about food 
handling, 
cleanliness 
and 

safety by Jeremy, the recent 
full-time hire; the Campus 
Farm places a great deal of 
importance on cleanliness and 
good agricultural practice.

In the first plot, there are 

rows upon rows of tomatoes, 
peppers and lettuce mixes. 
In the hoop house — recently 
built, and of which there will 
be two more very soon — is an 
assortment of kale and chard. 
The farm isn’t like one you’re 
used to; it’s smaller, more 
compact. But it is impressively 
well-maintained — and quite a 
sight to behold.

Christian Mackey, a first-

year Masters student in the 
School of Public Health, is 
a program director for the 
Student Food Co., which is 
an organization dedicated to 
making 
produce 
affordable 

and convenient for students on 
campus. As one of the Campus 
Farm’s main buyers, SFC has 
been, in Mackey’s experience, 
nothing but impressed with 
the program’s success.

“They not only help us in 

making food affordable, but 
they really help us in the side 
mission of ours, which is the 
promotion of sustainability,” 
he said. “Their practices are 
all organic and the fact that 
our partnership gives us a 
really convenient source of 
high-quality organic goods is 

invaluable to us.”

Student Food Co. — which 

doesn’t process any produce, 
and only sells whole, uncut 
fruits and vegetables — began 
partnering with Campus Farm 
last year, and it now sells their 
produce twice a week in Mason 
Hall.

“It’s felt like a growing 

movement 
since 
I’ve 
been 

with them, and the academic 
side of food is starting to grow 
here at U of M,” he said. “It’s 
a relationship we want to keep 
up.”

It is quite remarkable, too, 

to consider how much work 
goes into maintaining and 
running a successful farm, 
especially as students with 
classes, 
extracurriculars 

and other jobs. The fact that 
they’ve achieved this level 
of self-sustaining success in 
such a short period of time 
is downright impressive. But 

Sharp says it never feels like a 
job to her.

“It’s my favorite part of 

every week,” she said. “I just 
think it’s important to get out 
in nature, so I love going out to 
the farm — and I definitely got 
a community out of it.

***

The 
students 
who 

volunteered to help weeding 
are crouched on their knees in 
the main plot, plucking leaves 
that look — to the untrained eye 
— nearly indistinguishable from 
the crops to harvest. It’s hot out, 
but they’re having fun, and they 
look committed.

So 
does 
everyone 
here. 

The harvesting group listens 
intently and seriously to the 
instructions about cleanliness 
before 
steadfastly 
cleaning 

their hands and heading over to 
the hoop house. A volunteer — 
presumably a regular — pulls out 
a couple of poster mock-ups to 
help advertise the Campus Farm 
around campus.

Mackey tells me, “I know that 

when I go to the farm I feel an 
emotion that is similar to things 
that people would traditionally 
call art.” It sounds a bit cheesy, 
but it makes sense in context. 
It’s an experiment that’s paid 
off, a model of DIY hard work by 
students, for students. You could 
definitely call it art.

Cyrus Tetteh had grown 

tired of the feeling that his 
grades in the classroom were 
determining his value, and he 
wanted to do something about it. 
He started thinking about ways 
that he could create a platform 
for 
himself, 
and 
ultimately 

decided that he wanted to share 
his creative vision with others 
in the form of a clothing brand: 
Cool Club Clothing. I had the 
opportunity to sit down with 
Tetteh, a 2015 alum, and reflect 
on the process of starting his 
own brand while at U-M, and 
where he wants to go from here.

Can you tell me a bit about 

yourself and why you decided 
to start Cool Club Clothing?

“I’m originally from Detroit, 

Michigan. I lived there my whole 
life before deciding to attend 
the University of Michigan. … 
When I started taking classes 
— just normal freshman classes 
— I was getting tired of feeling 
like my value was based on my 
grades. I didn’t want my value 
as a person to be represented by 
the letter grade … And I came up 
with my own clothing line: Cool 
Club Clothing in 2012. I haven’t 
stopped since. I got a lot of 
support on campus … I did what 
I needed to do and I was just 
living and trying to have fun.”

You being able to find a way 

to do your own things outside 
of the traditional confines 
that a lot of students face is 
really interesting to me.

“The whole thing is that it 

started with the idea of me 
wanting to break free and 
figure out the things that I like 
to do and things that make me 
happy while still making me 
feel like I’m progressing in life. 
One thing leads to another, and 
you find the things that you 
love. It started with music. I 
wanted to create clothing that 
would promote my music, and 
then people would start asking 
me for things, saying, ‘Oh, you 
should do this in this color, you 
should do hats or maybe you 
should do this.’ I started making 
more things and it turned into a 
clothing line. I just really want 
to encourage people to do things 
and try things. Especially the 
people who feel confined by 
their grades like I did.”

So when you started Cool 

Club Clothing, did you have 
any overarching goals? What 
was your vision for the brand?

“Starting off, I made a couple 

of shirts for me and my friends 
to wear with the first design 
that I had made. … The growth 
[of the brand] was sort of driven 
by the people. … At the end of 
the day, I just wanted to create 
a platform for myself to climb 
that ladder to ultimately have 
that creative freedom and be 
able to give back to people. 
With the clothing, I wanted to 
take it as far as it could go. I 
didn’t know what that was. It 
was never concrete — whatever 
opportunity came my way, I’d 
jump into it.”

Can you talk a bit about the 

biggest hurdles that you had 

when starting the brand?

“The main questions were 

what will my first designs be 
and how do I get them on a 
shirt? I was sitting and doing 
my math homework one night 
when I got bored. I flipped 
over my homework and started 
drawing the first Cool Club 
logo. My roommate at the time 
offered to help me make my 
logo. Before he had done that, 
I had never used InDesign, 
Illustrator or Photoshop. He 
introduced me to all of those 
things, so I got those and I’ve 
been on since then. … Being so 
small, it can be expensive to 
make your clothing, so it’s a 
matter of finding the best place 
to do it. It was a lot of trial and 
error, but it worked out.”

Can you talk a bit more 

about the trial and error 
aspect?

“Everything 
was 
really 

driven by the people, but there 
was a process of figuring out 
which materials worked and 
didn’t work and which shirts 
fit the way I wanted to was 
something that took some time.

Learning that you can’t please 

everyone and learning how to 
communicate with customers 
was difficult, but I knew that a 
bad customer experience could 
be 
the 
difference 
between 

someone 
who 
would 
never 

try the brand and a lifetime 
supporter.”

You’ve mentioned a few 

times that the growth of 
the brand was driven by 
the people. What was it like 
starting a brand on U-M’s 

campus specifically?

“It’s an experience like no 

other. Until you’re a super huge 
brand, never will you be able 
to walk outside and see people 
wearing 
your 
brand. 
There 

was a point in time where it 
was regular to walk outside, 
especially during the winter, 
and see people wearing the 
Cool Club hats. And because of 
that, you kinda get lost in it. … 
Being on campus, it was cool. 
I got a lot of support along the 
way, and the resources that we 
have — the fashion orgs and 
everything else — provide so 
many opportunities to promote 
your brand on campus.

It made it this thing around 

here. And that was cool. That 
really helped me a lot and gave 
me a lot of confidence. It slowly 
made me feel like I had a leg to 
stand on. I felt like my value 
was being determined by my 
creations instead of my grades.

I appreciate the love I got 

from 
Michigan. 
I 
had 
the 

chance to work with some of the 
student-athletes. I got to work 
with Denard Robinson — we did 
a little pop up shop. It was cool, 
man.”

So after you graduated in 

2015, can you touch on how 
it was moving away from 
campus?

“When 
you 
talk 
about 

hurdles, that’s definitely the 
biggest hurdle.

On campus, it felt like it 

was cool. It was this trial and 
error process and people were 
supporting it. When I left 
campus, it felt like it was me 

versus the world instead of a 
small community. I had to dig 
deeper into my artistry, sit 
down and bring some life to my 
design.

I worked with my high 

school, Cass Tech, and did a 
collection with them, which 
helped because they have such 
a big alumni network. Right 
after that, I did a collection 
with Devin Funchess. That was 
cool because he was going to the 
Super Bowl that year, had just 
come from Michigan and he’s a 
really cool guy.

It wasn’t until the summer 

of 2015 when I realized that I 
needed to stop doing all these 
collabs and work on defining 
my brand within the city. I 
wanted to find a way to get 
out my own name rather than 
using someone else’s brand. I 
spent some time working on my 
designing skills to take my skills 
to the next level, and came up 
with my Detroit Players Club 
design, which was my most 
successful design to date. That 
felt like the introduction of my 
brand to Detroit.”

Moving forward, where do 

you see things in five years?

“Really, 
photography 
has 

come in and changed things. 
At first, I picked up the camera 
to 
promote 
my 
brand, 
but 

now I’m working for the city 
as a photographer. I’ve been 
enjoying photography, I’m liking 
the foundation it’s building and 
it’s bringing money in. I want 
to continue to make clothing, 
but I’m definitely going to be 
focusing on my photos.

I really want Cool Club to 

keep growing. I have some 
designs that will be coming 
soon. I want Cool Club to be a 
creative outlet. That’s all I ever 
wanted it to be — an outlet for 
when I feel like putting out a 
design or I want to work with 
a certain brand. I don’t want to 
leave it hanging, and I want to 
keep using it as a creative outlet 
to make statements. Maybe it 
turns into a platform to raise 
awareness for certain issues.

I’ll still be doing my thing 

in five years. Right now I’m 
just living between the two 
[photography 
and 
clothing]. 

I’m trying to go hard at both, 
honestly. Just trying to find a 
way to balance the two.”

Do you have any advice for 

people who may feel the same 
way you did as a freshman and 
want to create something like 
you did?

“My advice is to just get 

started. Get started and don’t 
look back. That’s the most 
important thing that you can do 
as someone who wants anything 
for themselves. You can’t think 
about it for too long. Nothing 
is ever going to be perfect, but 
if you know what you want and 
you can see it, you can make 
it happen. It’s your vision, so 
trust your vision and start 
taking those first steps. Do 
what you need to do to make 
it happen. You never know 
what could happen once you 
take those first steps. The best 
way to learn is to go through 
the process, and it really is a 
process.”

COURTESY OF FILMIC PRODUCTIONS

Filmic Productions is a group on campus
Filmic brings professional 
production to our campus 

The independent production company brings organization and 
diversity to create professional grade video for the university

You’re sitting in the Big 

House, it’s graduation, and 
you are leaving your home 
of the last four years. And in 
the midst of all the tears and 
commencement addresses, a 

video plays — one filled with 
all of the things that made 
being a Wolverine over the 
past four years so special, one 
filled with the inside jokes that 
only students at the University 
share. Professionally done, and 
over five minutes long, this 
video, and many of the others 
you’ve seen throughout your 

time at the University, was 
made by Filmic Productions, 
Michigan’s 
premier 
student 

run video production group.

Filmic is a group filled 

with a diversity of students, 
who range in ages, majors 
and passions. From Ross to 
Anthropology 
to 
Creative 

Writing, 
they 
all 
share 

ELI RALLO

Daily Arts Writer

FILM
one passion — making and 
producing films. As a group, 
they 
consider 
themselves 

“cinematic problem solvers” 
and strive to make students, 
alumni and professors alike 
“feel something” from the 
videos they put out year after 
year.

LSA senior Michael Boctor, 

Filmic’s lead director, was 
passionate about Filmic from 
the moment he was accepted 
to Michigan. “I opened up 
my acceptance letter to the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

and 
there 
was 
this 
little 

video attached beneath the 
‘CONGRATULATIONS—
You’re 
IN!’,” 
he 
said. 
“I 

watched it and had chills 
running through my veins. 
The video made me more 
passionate than ever about 
becoming 
a 
Wolverine. 
It 

evoked 
excitement 
and 

emotion in me, and I could 
tell that the University must 
have had to hire some serious 
professionals to get that done. 
I wasn’t wrong. That video 
was Filmic Productions’s “The 
Letter M.” Behind the camera 
were a bunch of individuals 
with a combination of talent 
and passion that created a 
dominant force in the market 
they were in, and I couldn’t 
help but be drawn towards 
that.”

The 
students 
who 
join 

Filmic do so because they have 
a passion for film and creating 
art that sends a message to a 
larger group. They are driven 
by the desire to create, but also 
by the larger desire to share 
stories. “Film is a reflection 
of our society, but film also 
helps define society,” said LSA 
senior Michelle Kim, Filmic’s 
producer.

Filmic plays a big part 

in defining the society at 
the 
University. 
Between 

Bicentennial address videos, 
graduation videos, acceptance 
videos and countless others 
that have racked up thousands 
upon thousands of views, they 
are no doubt the head media 
group on campus.

What’s even more important 

than the work they do, though, 
is the community they build 
doing 
it. 
They 
consider 

themselves a very tight-knit 
group — and more than just 
friends, they are family. They 
split meetings into general 
team meetings and project 
specific 
meetings 
to 
keep 

organized.

“If it’s early in the production 

timeline, the producer will 
normally give the update and 
talk about about how to have 
conversations with the client 

and what we’re brainstorming,” 
Rachel Hurwitz, LSA senior 
and producer, said. “If it’s in 
the production stage, normally 
the director will talk about the 
shoots we have lined up, what 
is working and what’s not and 
how we are planning to move 
forward. Finally, if it’s in the 
post-production 
stage, 
the 

editor will discuss how it’s all 
coming together.” 

Though a lot of fun, the team 

of Filmic has a lot of weight 
on their shoulders as well. 

With the University enlisting 
them to work on projects for 
publicity and special events, 
there’s a lot of pressure to 
succeed. “Being so professional 
really puts on the pressure to 
perform,” LSA senior Leah 
Hirsh, another producer, said. 
“It makes a project more than 
just something you make for 
your 
own 
satisfaction. 
It’s 

an opportunity to really say 
something and have a voice to 
a larger population. So often 
as college students, our voices 
feel unimportant. These larger 
projects give Filmic, a group 
of college students, a powerful 
platform to tell stories.”

Filmic 
prides 
themselves 

on their focus as a storytelling 
group. This makes their art 
more 
personal 
and 
more 

influential on the society of 
Ann Arbor, Michigan.

“You’re 
taking 
something 

that never existed and forming 
something out of it, something 
that 
makes 
people 
feel 

different after,” said Kim. “It’s 
storytelling at its best.”

By being such a large part of 

the University, Filmic reaches a 
diverse group of people — and 
it’s really important to the team 
that they continue to do so.

In a world where people need 

to relate to and understand 
art, Filmic is more needed 
than ever. And the work that 
they have done, and will do 
going forward, is extremely 
important to telling the stories 
of every person who walks 
through the Diag, sits in the Big 
House and attends a lecture in 
Angell Hall.

“We 
brand 
ourselves 
as 

creative problem solvers and 
I think that is really true,” 
Hurwitz said. “Being in Filmic 
has caused me to start looking 
at the world differently, not 
only in how to frame a shot, 
but how to interact with the 
people and the world around 
me and influence them in a 
positive light. It’s not just about 
how to make the video look 
professional, but how to make 
something people are going to 
feel connected to and want to 
watch again and again.”

Behind the 
camera were 

a bunch of 

individuals with 
a combination of 
talent and passion 

that created a 

dominant force in 
the market they 

were in

COMEDY CENTRAL

What if we wrote a show about us just ‘hanging out’ you know?
City of Aspiring Angels: How 
the ‘U’ competes in the LA 
screenwriting hellscape

There’s an urban legend floating 

around the Screen Arts and Cultures 
department that two students in the 
program sold a spec-script to “Broad 
City.” Through my inconclusive 
investigations, I can neither confirm 
nor deny the validity of this story, 
so, for now, it’ll have to remain a 
myth. (But how cool would it be if 
it were true?) Regardless, it’s a tale 
that those with literary aspirations 
love to hear as they fire up a brand-
spanking new document of Final 
Draft. After all, Matt Damon and Ben 
Affleck wrote “Good Will Hunting” 
in college, so really anything is 

possible.

If spending a summer in Los 

Angeles taught me one thing, it’s 
that the aspiring writer’s pipe dream 
is, ironically, a Hollywood cliché. At 
any given L.A. coffee shop, at least 
three laptops would be opened to an 
unfinished screenplay, with an over-
caffeinated 
and 
under-groomed 

“creative” at the keyboard. Even 
Uber drivers, without fail, tried to 
sell me on their movie pitch as soon 
as they caught drift that I was in 
“the biz.” Little did they know I was 
a just a bushy-tailed intern.

Even my “original” ideas were 

already taken. My roommate and I 
had been toying with the premise 
for a workplace TV comedy set 
in the mailroom of a Hollywood 
talent agency. Our story was coming 

together swimmingly: we’d thought 
of the characters, the love-triangles, 
the neurotic bosses. And, since 
Hollywood loves producing stories 
about Hollywood, we joked that 
this was our ticket to screenwriting 
success. That is, until I overheard 
some tipsy guy in Santa Monica 
trying to impress a thoroughly 
unimpressed girl with a plan to pitch 
his (identical) original series “The 
Mailroom” to a network executive 
later that week.

In a market oversaturated with 

talent, how are aspiring writers 
able to differentiate themselves? 
The odds seem daunting at best, if 
not downright demoralizing. And 
yet, even in Los Angeles, a city over 
2,000 miles away from Ann Arbor, 
the University of Michigan finds a 

way to take care of its own.

It 
starts 
in 
the 
classroom. 
The 

Screen Arts and Cultures department, 
lovingly abbreviated to SAC (rumors are 
circulating of an impending rename, due 
to overwhelming confusion), often flies 
under the radar. With a relatively small 
yearly cohort of about fifty graduating 
students, the program does not begin to 
compete in size with the L.A. and New York 
City film schools. However, 
the 
department 
has 

developed a screenwriting 
sub-major 
completely 

unique to that of other 
Film and Television studies 
programs. In short, it forces 
aspiring writers to actually 
do the writing, and do a 
lot of it. In Screenwriting 
I: 
The 
Feature 
Script, 

students are challenged to 
write an entire, feature-
length film throughout the 
course of a single semester. 
In Writing for Television 
II: Pilots, students end the 
semester with an original 
pilot 
under 
their 
belt, 

which is perhaps the single 
most valuable intellectual 
real estate an aspiring TV 
writer can bring with her to 
Hollywood.

And while it’s not particularly in the 

campus 
spotlight, 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan film community is always eager 
to do more. Students across disciplines 
flock to organizations like Filmic and 
M-agination, both clubs that develop 
and produce original films. There’s an 
eagerness to create and collaborate, and 
this energy is palpable.

Ann Arbor, in its own way, is a little 

movie mecca. Home to the annual Ann 
Arbor Film Festival, what other college 
town can boast two movie theaters within 
a five minute walking distance of central 
campus?

Los Angeles is a different beast all 

together. Celebrity spottings occur daily, 
traffic is horrible and, somewhere, an 
assistant is being yelled at for getting the 

coffee order wrong. And 
yet, the SAC department 
still found a way to bring 
a piece of Ann Arbor to 
Hollywood. 
With 
the 

help of two particularly 
generous Michigan alumni, 
Kelci 
Parker 
and 
Dan 

Pipski, the department was 
able to put on a speaker 
series for all the SAC majors 
interning in Los Angeles. 
At weekly sessions, interns 
had the opportunity to talk 
with industry executives, 
writers, 
directors 
and 

producers. 
It 
was 
the 

exclusive 
University 
of 

Michigan 
scoop, 
and 

somehow, I always left with 
a renewed sense of hope. 
Maybe, it wasn’t all just a 
pipe dream.

So, I’ve come to the humble conclusion 

that the only way to be a writer is to write, 
and write a lot. Perhaps “making it” only 
comes to those that tell stories without 
the expectation of fame, recognition or 
anyone liking what they’ve done. Success 
is definitely a function of talent, but not 
without passion and persistence. Some 
luck (that may come in the form of a 
helpful Michigan alumnus) helps, too.

Students, sports and 
success on ‘The Spew’

Just a bunch of dudes, talkin’ bought sports ‘n’ stuff

Undergraduates who have found a way to bridge a seemingly 
impossible divide between the students and student athletes 

It’s Sunday night at 5:00 

p.m. For some, this means 
heading to the library to 
catch up on procrastinated 

homework. Others eat dinner 
with friends or family. Many 
rush to club meetings and 
group 
projects.

School of Kinesiology juniors 
J.J. Wachler and Ben Meyers, 
however, Sunday night means 
one thing: time for “The Spew.”

“The 
Spew” 
is 
a 
five-

minute Facebook TV show 
that focuses on the University 
of Michigan athletics and its 
athletes. In the short time 
span, host Ben Meyers “spews” 
statistics, stories and theories 
about sports. They often have 
athletic guests to share their 
opinions, 
such 
as 
football 

running 
back 
and 
School 

of 
Kinesiology 
sophomore 

Chris Evans. At face value, 
it sounds similar to a show 
on SportsCenter or Big Ten 
Network. What makes “The 
Spew” different, however, is 
Wachler and Meyer’s approach 
to telling these sports stories. 

Meyers 
explained 
how 

their platform is unique to the 
University student experience: 
“We wanted to build a bridge 
between the students and the 
athletes on campus.”

Recognizing a major issue 

with athletics on campus — that 
the athletes are untouchable, 
so to speak — the pair set out 
to connect “regular” students 
to athletes. The decision to 
report on sports from a student 
perspective is what makes 
the show so relatable to their 
peers.

“Athletes are constantly in 

rooms where adults are asking 
them questions. They’re just 
being hammered about their 
statistics, scores and stats. It’s 
refreshing for them to have 
questions about their Yeezys, 
their recruiting stories … the 
student side of things.”

The approach is working for 

them. Launched last February, 
the show now averages 5,000 
views per episode. Loyal fans 
tune in each week to watch 
and ask questions. A unique 

element of the show is the live-
stream function, which allows 
viewers 
to 
pose 
questions 

and react to the athletes and 
Meyers in real time. Some 
of the comments are silly, 
but others spark interesting 
conversations.

Meyers and Wachler are 

ahead 
of 
the 
curve 
when 

it 
comes 
to 
streaming 
on 

Facebook 
Live. 
Just 
last 

month, Facebook introduced 
their “watch” feature, which 
includes original content that 
viewers can comment on, share 
and interact with. It is one of 
the most accessible ways to 
watch media content.

“They [the viewers] could sit 

down for five minutes on the 
platform they’re already on, 
Facebook, and watch our show 
and then be done for the day — 
it’s a nice little break,” Meyers 
added.

Their innovative approach 

to sports reporting hasn’t gone 
unnoticed. Wachler and Meyers 
recently won the Michigan 
Sports Business Conference 
“Sports Startup Competition.” 
As 
winners, 
the 
duo 
will 

present “The Spew” to sports 
business professionals and get 
feedback on their platform. 
With aspirations to create a 
format that can be replicated 
and rolled out at other colleges, 
this opportunity is pivotal. 
On a more local scale, they’ve 
found sponsors eager to join 
in: Salads Up, Campus Laundry 
and Valiant Clothing have all 
signed on.

What started as two friends 

talking sports in an apartment 
living room has evolved into 
a six-person operation with 
corporate sponsors and big 
plans. Wachler and Meyers 
are hungry to make waves in 
the sports media sector, and 
have taken it upon themselves 
to do so. Using Facebook Live 
to innovate, they’ve created a 
unique sports experience that 
isn’t Sunday night football. 
They’ve created Sunday night 
“Spew.”

The Spew airs live Sundays 

at 5:00 p.m. You can stream it 
on Facebook.
