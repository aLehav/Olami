ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Reggie‘s Story

How a local service dog 

became an unofficial 

campus mascot 

» Page 4B statement

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | SEPTEMBER 5, 2018

The University of Michigan 

has 
appointed 
four 
new 

deans in the 2018-19 school 
year for LSA, the School of 
Music, Theatre and Dance, 
Rackham 
Graduate 
School 

and the School of Public 
Health. With the start of the 
new school year, the deans 
say they are prioritizing the 
interdisciplinary aspects of 
higher education to continue 
establishing the University 
as 
a 
nationally 
ranked 

institution.

Elizabeth R. Cole, the newly 

appointed LSA interim dean, 
has served as LSA’s associate 
dean for social sciences the 
last four years. Though she 
believes former dean Andrew 

Martin leaves big shoes to 
fill, she says her experience 
working under his supervision 
will make this a smooth 
transition.

“The biggest task that we’ll 

have is to continue the regular 
functions of the college and to 
pursue the strong initiatives 
that we’re already working 
on,” she said.

Primary 
among 

these 
initiatives 
is 

LSA’s Opportunity Hub. While 
its permanent space is a part of 
the extensive construction at 
the 
Michigan 
Union, 
the 

hub can currently be found 
on the second floor of the 
LSA 
building. 
The 
hub 

will 
continue 
its 
focus 

on 
connecting 
students’ 

classroom 
experience 
with 

real world experience via

While you were away, you may 

have missed some big stories out 
of Ann Arbor. This week The Daily 
will be publishing recaps of the 
summer’s breaking news.

Over the summer, Ann Arbor 

City Council voted to change 
zoning codes related to Greek 
life houses in Ann Arbor.

The zoning codes, approved 

during the July 16 council 
session, 
would 
require 
new 

fraternities and sororities to 
maintain affiliation with the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
or 

another collegiate institution 
to be permitted or allowed 

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Central Student 

Government 
convened 

Tuesday night to introduce 
resolutions during their first 
meeting of the academic school 
year. 
Initiatives 
discussed 

included amendments to the 
compiled code, funding for 
various 
University 
Career 

Center events and efforts to 
improve safety features in 

academic 
buildings 
around 

campus.

CSG 
President 
Daniel 

Greene, a Public Policy senior, 
first summarized efforts made 
over the summer to improve 
campus and student life. There 
are also changes being made 
to the CSG executive board, 
including the addition of two 
new positions this semester. 
These 
positions, 
executive 

diversity officer and external 
relations 
officer, 
will 
be 

implemented this semester, 
then evaluated as to whether 
or not these positions are 
effective.

“If we find it productive and 

to the benefit of the student 
body, then we will propose an 
amendment to the constitution 
to ensure that CSG in the 
long term can better commit 
itself to DEI, inclusivity and 
also 
student 
organization 

collaboration 
efforts 
long 

term,” Greene said.

Additionally, 
CSG 
Vice 

President 
Izzy 
Baer, 
an 

University 
of 
Michigan 

have made strides in studying 
the effects of child separation 
and 
the 
psychological 

impact it has on families 
in 
cases 
of 
incarceration, 

military 
deployment, 
and 

border 
separation. 
This 

data has helped University 
psychologists 
implement 

programs 
such 
as 
Strong 

Military Families, Zero to 
Thrive and Parenting While 
Incarcerated, which focus on 
curbing the negative effects 
that 
may 
have 
occurred

Members of Central Student Government discuss new proposed initiatives during their meeting in the Michigan 
League Tuesday evening.


LSA junior, explained recent 
updates intended to improve 
accommodations for students 
with dietary restrictions in the 
University dining halls.

From 
listing 
ingredients 

listed for each food item to 
EpiPen training administered 
to 
all 
dining 
staff, 
these 

changes 
aim 
to 
make 
all 

students 
comfortable 
eating 

in the dining halls regardless 
of diet. It was also announced 
that hydration stations will be 
available again this football 
season, 
providing 
students 

with water, snacks and portable 

phone chargers throughout the 
day to better ensure student 
safety during these high-risk 
events.

A 
resolution 
introduced 

during the assembly addressed 
the need for a basic centralized 
room reservation information 
site for general student use 
on campus. Using an online 
database, this service would 

provide 
students 
with 

a list of available study 
spaces on campus they 
could reserve for work or 
meetings.

Rackham 
student 

Austin Glass said first-
year 
and 
transfer 

students 
are 
especially 

disadvantaged in terms 
of 
having 
established 

connections to resources 
that provide spaces to 
study and congregate.

“This is more of a call 

to action rather than a 
specific action that I’m 
asking 
CSG 
to 
take,” 

Glass said. “In this case 
I’m 
asking 
(student 

organizations) to all look 
into a very simple resource 
that would present to 
students rooms that are 
available for reservation.”

Upon 
consideration, 

these 
rooms 
would 

be 
available 
in 
three 

areas on campus where 
student 
residences 
are 

concentrated, 
including 

North Campus, the Hill 
neighborhood, and South 
Quad.

A resolution funding the 

Buses 
to 
Ballots 
initiative, 

which aims to increase voter 
participation and accessibility 
among students on election 
day, by providing shuttle buses 
to off-campus polling stations 
incited 
much 
conversation. 

Many students have class on 
election day and cannot afford 
to spend time waiting in long 
lines to vote.

“We already have the routes 

laid out, as well as the number 
of impacted students, which 
would be a huge number,” said 
Rackham 
student 
Nicholas 

Fadanelli.

Other initiatives have been 

enacted to alleviate this issue, 
including 
ride-sharing 
app 

Lyft’s offer to provide voters 
with free rides to polling 
places this November. Some 
representatives 
said 
one 

problem many students face, 
in addition to a lack of time, is 
the inability to pay to get from 
campus to a local polling place. 
Engineering senior AJ Ashman 
spoke to the assembly about his 
past experience traveling far 
distances to vote, citing large 
fees to get from one location to 
the other.

“In my mind … the fact that 

there is a cost to go to vote, 
seems to be kind of like a poll 
tax to me,” Ashman said. “I 
think this (initiative) is going 
to turn out to be a very good 
opportunity for us.”

Braylon Edwards, a former 

Michigan 
Football 
wide 

receiver and Big Ten Network 
analyst, was suspended from 
his role by the network after 
he tweeted negative remarks 
about the U-M football team 
following Saturday’s loss to 
Notre Dame.

Edwards’, 
now-deleted 

tweet, was posted Saturday 
night after the game and 

read: “(Cesar) Ruiz is weak, 
line is weak, shea (Patterson) 
is scared, (expletive) Michigan 
offense is so predictable.....
Michigan football is sadly one 
thing......Trash.”

The 
BTN 
suspended 

Edwards 
indefinitely, 

announcing on Twitter that 
the words were a violation 
of social media guidelines. 
Since then, he has tweeted a 
comment and later apology 
regarding the initial attack on 
individual players, while still 
affirming his criticism of the 

team as a whole.

During his career at the 

University, Edwards won the 
Fred Biletnikoff Award, given 
to the best wide receiver in 
the country, and earned All-
American honors. He continues 
to hold the school records for 
career receptions (252), yards 
(3,541) and touchdowns (39).

 While talking to reporters, 

Harbaugh 
commented 
on 

his 
disappointment 
in 
the 

comment. 

“Number one, first of all, 

(what he said) is not true. It’s 

not factual. There’s nobody 
in our program who thinks 
 

those things about any player 
on our team. Let alone the 
two players he described,” 
Harbaugh said. “On another 
level, it’s disappointing that 
a member of the Big Ten 
 

Network 
would 
choose 

to attack the character of 
two of our players. That’s 
disappointing.”

 Harbaugh followed up his 

defense of his players during 
a press conference on Monday. 
“If somebody wants to attack 

An organization for all 

students, a place for them 
to meet, the unification of 
various factions of student 
interest — that was the dream 
of University student Edward 
Parker in 1904. By 1907 the 
Michigan Union, the “student 
union” — was first opened in 
an old home on State Street.

But over the years the 

Union, housed in the current 
building since 1917, became 

“more of an alumni center 
and hotel service… less of a 
student center,” according to 
Henry Johnson, University 
vice-president for student 
services. In the year of the 
Union’s diamond anniversary 
Parker’s dream is being 
rejuvenated — the Michigan 
Union is undergoing a facelift 
in structure and philosophy. 

The renovations now in 

progress are the result of a 

year’s worth of efforts by 
students and administrators to 
change the building’s emphasis 
back to student activities. 

Currently, Barbers, billiards, 

books, bowling, and bus tickets 
are all available at the Union. 
There is also a box office, an art 
gallery, movies, and theatrical 
productions. Administrative 
officers for a wide range of 
student organizations and 
services are also housed in the 

Union. 

This fall, for the first time, 

students will be living in the 
Union. Renovations are being 
completed on 91 hotel rooms 
and 127 graduate students and 
students over 21 have signed 
leases.

All University students 

this fall will automatically be 
members of University Club, 
a restaurant on the first floor. 
Formerly only dues-paying 

students, faculty, alumni, and 
staff were members of the club, 
and relatively few students 
chose to join.

Plans are also being made 

to move and expand a section 
of the University Cellar into a 
snack bar. The new food service 
will be similar to the “MUG” 
(the Michigan Union Grill) 
which was a popular place for 
students to meet until it was 
closed in the early 1970’s.

A 24-member task force of 

students, faculty, alumni, and 
administrators was appointed 
in February to assess the 
operations of the campus 
landmark. Sub-committees 
of the task force submitted 
recommendations for 
programming, food service, and 
physical changes. 

A report detailing the 

recommendations of the task 
force was delayed during the 
summer and is expected to be 
released next week.

Despite the “slow progress” 

made on the report, feasibility 
studies were conducted this 
summer and renovations and 
clean-up have already started, 
according to Jeff Lebow, a 
member of the task force who 
is serving as an intern in the 
Office of Student Services 
(OSS) working on Union 
planning.

“I’ve been working all 

summer long to make sure 
they don’t forget it’s a student 
union,” Lebow said.

expansion within the city. If 
the fraternity or sorority loses 
its 
University 
affiliation 
in 

the future, it can apply for a 
two-year special exception to 
prevent loss of its house.

Some 
residents 
thought 

new zoning codes would help 
facilitate 
better 
relations 

between 
Greek 
life 
and 

neighboring residents. Others 
saw it as unfair to the owners 
of the houses and unclear as to 
who would be affected under 
the new guidelines.

Interfraternity 
Council 

President Sam Finn, a Public 
Policy senior, said the concerns 
raised 
by 
area 
residents 

regarding Greek life behavior 
demonstrated a need for greater 
effort 
to 
facilitate 
positive 

relationships with the Ann 
Arbor community.

“This summer served as a 

wakeup call to IFC that more 
has to be done to address 
neighborhood 
concerns 
and 

improve community relations,” 
Finn wrote. “Over the next 
semester, we will work with 
National Pan-Hellenic Council, 
Multicultural Greek Council, 
and 
National 
Panhellenic 

Conference 
to 
expand 
the 

efforts 
of 
the 
Community 

Relations Taskforce. We hope 
this will allow us to work to 
foster a closer relationship with 
Ann Arbor residents and more 
effectively address community 
concerns.”

During the July 16 session, 

residents also raised concerns 
about fraternities that no longer 
had an affiliation with the 
University but still operated 

within 
a 
fraternity 
house, 

leading to complaints about 
noise and cleanliness.

Peter 
Nagourney, 
the 

co-chair for the North Burns 
Park Association and neighbor 
to several Greek life houses, 
discussed 
one 
neighboring 

residence that housed a banned 
fraternity.

“You should know that one 

neighbor spent nine months 
constantly, and I mean daily, 
dealing with city, University 
police and Greek life entities 
before one of these party 
houses set up by members 
of a banned fraternity was 
shut down,” Nagourney said. 
“This is a real problem. Others 
in 
this 
neighborhood 
must 

constantly deal with trash, 
public 
drunkenness, 
loud 

music and other violations of 
city ordinances. Oversight of 
these groups is not done at the 
national level despite the claims 
of their attorneys. Oversight by 
the University and the Office 
of Greek Life does not seem to 
make much difference.”

Attorney Stephen Bernstein, 

a general counsel to the Alpha 
Epsilon Pi fraternity, said to 
The Daily in May the zoning 
codes create issues with third 
party regulation over privately 
owned property.

“The issue generally stated is 

whether the city of Ann Arbor 
is legally allowed to delegate 
decisions which impact the 
rights of property owners to 
a third party, in this case the 
University,” Bernstein said.

Finn also wrote the IFC 

understands the zoning codes 
were 
changed 
because 
of 

community concerns regarding 
Greek life housing.

“While 
individual 
IFC 

chapters, 
Inter/National 

Organizations, 
and 
housing 

groups may maintain their 
own perspectives in regards 
to the new zoning codes, the 
IFC 
understands 
that 
this 

change was a direct result of 
concerns expressed by Ann 
Arbor residents,” Finn wrote. 
“We will continue working 
collaboratively with the City, 
University, and Inter/National 
Organizations of IFC chapters 
to 
better 
address 
concerns 

raised by Ann Arbor residents 
and 
promote 
the 
positive 

impact our chapters have on 
their communities.”

Mayor Christopher Taylor 

stated during the July 16 session 
the new codes will improve 
relations between area residents 
and Greek life members.

“Our goal is to more accurately 

increase the likelihood that 
fraternities and sororities are 
good neighbors to everyone,” 
Taylor said. “In many cases they 
are. Occasionally they are not. 
I think this ordinance change 
will give us the opportunity to 
do something about it in that 
minority case.”

According 
to 
Finn, 
IFC 

has also made progress in its 
activism and voluntary efforts 
throughout 
the 
community. 

IFC had the largest number of 
applicants for the Michigan 
Ambassadors 
Program 
in 

the 
program’s 
history. 
The 

volunteer 
program 
helps 

provide 
additional 
safety 

monitors throughout campus 
during 
high-activity 
days, 

such 
as 
Football 
Saturdays 

or Halloween. IFC has also 
remained active in the Big Ten 
Voter Challenge and partnered 
with other offices on campus 
such as SAPAC.

The Daily in May the zoning 
codes create issues with third 
party regulation over privately 
owned property.

“The issue generally stated is 

whether the city of Ann Arbor 
is legally allowed to delegate 
decisions which impact the 
rights of property owners to 
a third party, in this case the 
University,” Bernstein said.

Finn also wrote the IFC 

understands the zoning codes 
were 
changed 
because 
of 

community concerns regarding 
Greek life housing.

“While 
individual 
IFC 

chapters, 
Inter/National 

Organizations, 
and 
housing 

groups 
may 
maintain 
their 

own perspectives in regards 

to the new zoning codes, the 
IFC 
understands 
that 
this 

change was a direct result of 
concerns expressed by Ann 
Arbor residents,” Finn wrote. 
“We will continue working 
collaboratively with the City, 
University, and Inter/National 
Organizations of IFC chapters 
to 
better 
address 
concerns 

raised by Ann Arbor residents 
and 
promote 
the 
positive 

impact our chapters have on 
their communities.”

Mayor Christopher Taylor 

stated 
during 
the 
July 
16 

session the new codes will 
improve 
relations 
between 

area residents and Greek life 
members.

“Our goal is to more accurately 

increase the likelihood that 
fraternities and sororities are 
good neighbors to everyone,” 

Taylor said. “In many cases they 
are. Occasionally they are not. 
I think this ordinance change 
will give us the opportunity to 
do something about it in that 
minority case.”

According 
to 
Finn, 
IFC 

has also made progress in its 
activism and voluntary efforts 
throughout 
the 
community. 

IFC had the largest number of 
applicants for the Michigan 
Ambassadors 
Program 
in 

the 
program’s 
history. 
The 

volunteer 
program 
helps 

provide 
additional 
safety 

monitors throughout campus 
during 
high-activity 
days, 

such 
as 
Football 
Saturdays 

or Halloween. IFC has also 
remained active in the Big Ten 
Voter Challenge and partnered 
with other offices on campus 
such as SAPAC.

within the family unit due to 
separation interference.

Katherine 
Rosenblum, 
a 

clinical professor of psychiatry 
at the University and the 
founder of Strong Military 
Families, said this research is 
so important because there are 
still misconceptions about the 
severity of separation. 

“I do think that often the 

emotional 
experiences 
of 

infants, toddlers and young 
children are overlooked or 
misunderstood, 
and 
that 

parents are often surprised 
by 
how 
impactful 
these 

experiences are even for very 
young children,” Rosenblum 
said. “And of course, parents 
have their own feelings about 
these experiences. Therefore, 
support 
for 
families 
who 

have experienced disruptive 
separations is very important.”

Rosenblum said this support 

can come in many different 
forms, such as distributing 
information on what to expect 
from 
children, 
connecting 

families experiencing similar 
trauma or connecting families 
to advocacy organizations who 
can offer additional services.

Rosenblum’s 
11-year-old 

daughter, 
Maja 
Rosenblum-

Muzik, 
created 
a 
publicly 

available 
coloring 
book 
in 

conjunction 
with 
Rackham 

student Paige Safyer titled 
“Cecilia and the Long Walk.” 
The coloring book illustrates 
a separation scenario through 
the perspective of the child.

The book follows the main 

character, 
Cecilia, 
who 
is 

a horse traveling across a 

border with her parents. This 
resource was created to “help 
children 
understand 
their 

recent experience, providing 
language 
to 
help 
organize 

internal confusion and terror,” 
according to their website.

Rosenblum 
wrote 

an op-ed for The Hill this past 
June, where she argues her 
research on military families 
can be used to explain the 
severity of separation at the 
border. 
She 
also 
explains 

every experience is different 
for each family— at the border 
or in the military — but there 
are certainly similarities that 
should be extrapolated.

“My point in sharing our 

work with military families was 
not to say that the experiences 
on the border are the same,” 
she told The Daily. “Obviously 
there are many differences in 
the experiences of military 
families 
and 
families 
on 

the border. My point was to 
highlight 
that 
even 
when 

there is time to prepare and 
access to resources, support, 
and information during the 
separation, the disruption is 
still impactful and emotionally 
challenging. 
Therefore, 

separations 
should 
not 
be 

taken casually.”

Public 
Health 
professor 

Alison 
Miller 
has 
also 

researched 
parent-child 

separation. 
She 
partnered 

with Motherly Intercession to 
create 
a 
program 

called 
Parenting 
While 

Incarcerated, 
which 
helps 

mothers continue to develop 
their parenting skills while 
behind bars.

Miller said her evidence-

based program was created 
in response to incarcerated 

mothers’ 
needs. 
This 

educational opportunity allows 
these 
mothers 
to 
improve 

communication 
skills 
and 

develop nonviolent discipline 
strategies.

“The 
program 
allows 

mothers to step back from the 
immediacy of parenting and 
reflect on the relationships 
with their children in a way 
they 
haven’t 
done 
before,” 

Miller said.

Another 
University 

initiative, Zero to Thrive, is led 
by Rosenblum and psychiatry 
professor Maria Muzik, along 
with Miller. Zero to Thrive 
focuses specifically on the first 
1,000 days of an infant’s life 
and the critical role that stress 
can play in development.

The initiatives that arose 

out 
of 
the 
University’s 

research on child separation 
are benchmark programs for 
other 
organizations 
these 

seeking solutions. And with the 
recent child separations at the 
border, Rosenblum hopes these 
findings will shed light on the 
caliber of the repercussions.

“For an infant, being abruptly 

separated from your parent for 
several days is an eternity, and 
likely traumatizing,” she said. 
“The parents and infants at 
the border experienced these 
separations under significant 
duress, 
often 
without 
any 

information about what was 
happening and when or if they 
would see each other again. 
There is no doubt that this 
was extremely traumatizing 
for many of these parents and 
children, and that there will 
be a need to work through the 
feelings associated with that 
trauma 
after 
they 
reunite. 

Healing takes time.”

Cole was one of the team 

members 
who 
developed 

the 
Diversity, 
Equity 
and 

Inclusion plan — which aims 
to 
diversify 
the 
campus 

community and create a more 
inclusive 
climate 
— 
in 
its 

beginning 
stages. 
She 
will 

continue spearheading the third 
year of DEI initiatives. Her work 
and research as a professor in 
women’s studies, psychology 
and African and Afro-American 
studies has allowed her to 
highlight 
the 
intersectional 

nature 
of 
the 
University 

experience 
and 
continue 

facilitating and supporting the 
five-year DEI plans developed 
by each department.

Though the DEI plan has 

faced criticism for its inability 
to quickly address several recent 
racist incidents on campus, Cole 
plans to build momentum for 
the DEI plan through projects 
such as the Comprehensive 
Studies 
Program, 
Summer 

Bridge 
Scholars 
Program, 

LSA Laptop Loan Program, 
 

Passport Scholarships and the 
Kessler Presidential Scholars 
program.

In 
addition 
to 
all 
these 

initiatives, 
Cole 
said 
it 
is 

especially 
important 
to 

highlight 
the 
many 
spaces 

on 
Central 
Campus 
that 

allow students, faculty and 
staff to gain experience in 
promoting 
dialogue. 
She 

wants to encourage dialogue 
among people with different 
experiences with the additional 
aid of organizations such as 
the Program on Intergroup 
Relations as well as We Listen 
and Our Community Listens.

“At this point in our history, 

it’s really important for those 
honest conversations to take 
place, and I want to make 
sure everybody’s aware of the 
opportunities on campus to 
have those respectful, honest 
conversations,” Cole said.

Michael 
J. 
Solomon, 

a 
professor 
of 
chemical 

engineering, has been appointed 
as 
the 
dean 
of 
Rackham 

Graduate School, also holding 
the title of vice-provost for 
academic affairs and graduate 
studies.

For the more than 8,000 

Rackham students on campus, 
Solomon 
said 
his 
primary 

responsibility is supporting the 
experience and education of 
graduate students, in all facets 
of the University.

“Our goals are a continuation 

of a need. As society gets more 
complex, there’s more and more 
need for this advanced training,” 
Solomon said. “I would like 

to catalyse discussions with 
faculty and students about how 
we need to organize graduate 
education on campus to address 
future needs.”

Though his work as associate 

dean and vice-provost, Solomon 
has worked to advance DEI 
initiatives in Rackham as well 
as 
network 
with 
graduate 

school partners on campus. He 
highlighted that the diversity 
of graduate education presents 
certain challenges, but also 
can be harnessed to benefit 
education as a whole.

“We really need to grow 

and sustain the focus on this 
education as being student-
focused, 
it 
being 
inclusive, 

and the leveraging of values 
of diversity,” Solomon said. “A 
challenge is an opportunity.”

Solomon noted one of his 

favorite aspects about working 
at Rackham is the ability to work 
with professionals in different 
fields that are student-focused 
and provide opportunities and 
workshops. An engineer by 
training, 
Solomon 
supports 

and is exposed to advanced 
education in a wide variety of 
fields.

“Everybody is getting the 

same degree, but how they go 
about that is just remarkably 
diverse, and that really is a 
strength at the University,” he 
said.

David Gier, newly appointed 

dean of the School of Music, 
Theatre and Dance, is currently 
preparing for his term, which 
begins 
in 
October. 
Gier 

graduated from the University 
with a bachelor’s degree in 
music and continued to earn 
a doctorate degree from Yale 
University. We started his work 
in higher education by serving 
as a professor and director at 
the University of Iowa School of 
Music. He said his experience as 
a University undergrad student 
motivated him to return.

“My whole professional path 

was propelled by my experience 
at the University of Michigan,” 
Gier said. “The quality of that 
experience and what it meant 
to me were really defining, and 
it set me up for success in the 
future. So I’ve always had this 
respect and admiration and love 
for the University of Michigan. 
To return is kind of a dream 
come true.”

Gier’s first order of business 

is familiarizing himself with 
the faculty, students and staff. 
He says he will gauge long 
term goals and utilize the 
University’s unique aspects to 
create 
collaborative 
projects 

with the public and connect 
students with the professional 
world.

“The 
vitality 
of 
SMTD 

comes from the faculty and the 
students, the plans that they 
make and the aspirations they 

have as they go to their work 
throughout the year,” he said.

Gier finds that the size of 

SMTD 
will 
present 
certain 

challenges but also highlights 
the exciting aspects of working 
in the arts.

“The 
way 
that 
the 
arts 

are constantly evolving and 
changing, there’s an inherent 
challenge in that. We have great 
traditions, but at the same time, 
for instance, the influence of 
technology is changing the 
way that students and the 
general public and our faculty 
engage with their art form,” 
Gier explained. “I think we’re 
always challenged in the arts 
to hang on to our roots and to 
our deep disciplinary traditions 
while at the same time evolving 
so as to be totally engaged and 
relevant.”

F. 
DuBois 
Bowman 
has 

been appointed the dean of 
the School of Public Health, 
his term beginning in October. 
Currently concluding his work 
as chairman of the Department 
of Biostatistics at Columbia 
University, his appointment at 
the University will allow him 
continue his work in the field 
of public health while bringing 
him back to his native city and 
the school at which he earned a 
master’s degree in biostatistics

“U-M is a school that I 

have connections with as an 
alumnus, and being from Ann 

Arbor, I have deep roots and feel 
a connection to the city, which 
also was certainly a factor that 
drove my interest and decision 
ultimately to return,” Bowman 
said.

One 
of 
Bowman’s 
main 

priorities for the upcoming term 
is 
spearheading 
community 

engagement and impact in the 
state of Michigan, targeting 
public health needs such as 
infant mortality, asthma, lead 
exposure and adult obesity.

“I want to make sure that 

through the great resources of 
the school, more research and 
more education, we work to 
have the strongest and biggest 
impact that we can in the state 
of Michigan,” Bowman said.

The School of Pulbic Health is 

undergoing only its second year 
of undergraduate education, and 
Bowman will work to continue 
to evolve the program and 
prepare for the first graduating 
class at the end of the academic 
year. Additionally, the School 
of Public Health plans to launch 
the nation’s first online Master 
of Public Health degree, which 
will launch in the fall of 2019.

“One of the things that I 

really value is interdisciplinary 
research 
and 
education,” 

Bowman said. “I look forward 
to partnering with the other 
deans 
trying 
to 
determine 

some synergies where we may 
establish some new programs.”

The Epitome of Hometown Hero
 A

retha Franklin has 
lovingly been coined 
the Queen of Soul. 
Her decades of music have 
represented her roots through 
powerhouse hits and beautiful 
ballads, and her legacy as one 
of the greatest vocalists of all 
time is eternal. Her recent 
death has left members of every 
generation remembering the 
impact of soul on the music 
industry, but more importantly, 
the communities that fostered 
its growth. And no community 
has 
celebrated 
this 
impact 
as extensively as Franklin’s 
hometown: Detroit, Michigan.
As Franklin’s career began 
to take off, there was never 
a doubt about from where 
her understanding of music 
came. Her early years in the 
considered “home of blues” 
were 
fundamental 
to 
her 
musical elocution and ability. 
Daughter to a Detroit pastor, 
Franklin was raised on the 
music 
of 
Baptist 
churches 
and quickly became a singer 
for her father’s New Bethel 
Baptist Church. These gospel 
influences 
are 
what 
made 
Franklin’s voice so memorable 
and improvisational, and both 
gospel techniques and jazz 
rhythms 
were 
discernible 
throughout 
her 
six-decade 
career. Just as these stylistic 
choices 
remained 
based 
in 
Detroit, so did her heart and 
life. While she spent time 
touring, 
Franklin 
shuttled 
between the various venues 
across the country and her 
hometown of Detroit, finally 
moving back in 1982. Her time 
spent in Detroit showed love 
for a city that truly loved her 
back. She was a philanthropist 
who donated and gave back to 
her father’s church, sending 
$10,000 checks several times 
a year. She organized annual 
concerts and holiday meals. 
She has been recognized for 
supporting 
other 
churches 
and local food banks in the 

area. And she always made her 
presence quiet and humble.
Detroit 
is 
the 
home 
of 
the popular American music 
movement known as Motown, 
and it is also a center for gospel, 
R&B, jazz and blues. These 
musical influences are a staple 
of Detroit culture and give the 
city’s artistic world something to 
look up to and of which be proud.
Despite this rich cultural 
history 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
Detroit 
has 
recently 
been 
regarded as “up and coming” 
and “rebuilding,” the city has 
not been immune to negative 
coverage and opinion in the last 

few decades, especially around 
the time of the city’s well-
documented 2013 bankruptcy. 
Articles 
with 
titles 
like 
“Detroit: a city in decline” and 
“Anatomy of Detroit’s Decline” 
in 
well-read 
publications 
are 
what 
have 
fueled 
the 
pessimistic national narrative 
of Detroit.
Dangerous. 
Inefficient. 
Frightening.
These are only some of the 
descriptors outsiders are used 
to hearing about the Motor 
City. People look in on Detroit 
from far away and question 
its livelihood. They look at 
its missteps and make those 
blunders its entire existence. 
But a city is so much more 
than 
strictly 
numbers 
and 
generalizations. A city is built 
on people. And the culture 
of Detroit is something that 
shows these people to the 
world. When you see that 

culture, Detroit begins to mean 
something to you. Living in 
Metro Detroit my entire life, I 
have always viewed the city in 
a different light than the media 
would like me to see.
Artistic. Resilient. Strong.
Detroit has a unique energy, 
and it moves those who care 
enough to search for it. Franklin 
made people want to search. She 
was a mouthpiece for everything 
Detroit stands for, and a constant 
reminder of what can come from 
a place like Detroit. A city with 
culture, history, heart. A city 
that makes you work. A city that 
has undergone hardship and still 
managed to persevere. Franklin 
was a perfect example of the 
type of success a community 
like Detroit can create. She loved 
her city, contributed to her city 
and, 
most 
importantly, 
was 
present in the community. Her 
contributions are what make her 
the epitome of a hometown hero. 
She was an advertisement for 
everything Detroit means to the 
people who live there.
In her death, Detroit quickly 
turned from a place of mourning 
to a place of celebration. Her life is 
being memorialized in every corner 
of the city, and the Queen of Soul 
is being treated as royalty. There 
have been constant reminders of 
her life, from billboards up and 
down every Detroit highway to 
hundreds gathering at her church 
to have a gospel choir tribute. Her 
two-day open casket viewing at 
the Charles H. Wright Museum 
of African American History 
brought in thousands of fans and 
citizens who wished to pay their 
respects. What you give to life will 
come back to you. Franklin gave 
her community everything she 
had, and made sure the rest of the 
world knew it too. In doing so, she 
will forever be remembered as a 
symbol of Detroit.

Human Being versus Football Fan

T

he Urban Meyer scandal 
of 2018 is exactly what 
our misogynistic, self-
absorbed culture desperately 
needed. Unfortunately, faced 
with the opportunity to make 
a powerful statement about 
the gravity of domestic abuse 
and the need for systemic 
cultural change, the Ohio State 
University Football Program 
fundamentally failed.
 The Urban Meyer scandal 
of 2018 is exactly what our 
misogynistic, 
self-absorbed 
culture 
desperately 
needed. 
Unfortunately, faced with the 
opportunity to make a powerful 
statement about the gravity of 
domestic abuse and the need for 
systemic cultural change, the 
Ohio State University football 
program fundamentally failed.
Before I go any further, let me 
first clarify that I say this not as 
a football fan and a Wolverine, 
but as a human being. Second, 
let me also clarify that I don’t 
necessarily believe Meyer should 
have been fired.
In fact, let me backtrack a 
little and give a quick summary for 
those of you who are unfamiliar 
with the recent scandal within 
OSU’s 
football 
program. 
Up 
until this August, Zach Smith 
was an assistant coach for the 
OSU football team. Smith is the 
grandson of Earle Bruce, the 
iconic former OSU football coach 
who, in his lifetime, served as a 
mentor for Meyer, OSU’s current 
head football coach.
Ultimately, the gist of the 
scandal is this: Courtney Smith, 
Zach 
Smith’s 
now 
ex-wife, 
pressed charges against Smith 
for domestic abuse in both 2009 
and 2015. It is widely implicated 
that Meyer was aware of these 
abuse allegations and swept them 
under the rug in order to keep 
Smith on his coaching staff, and 
that he lied about doing so at Big 
Ten Media Day.
After a report implied that 
Meyer had intentionally looked 
the other way from Smith’s alleged 
domestic abuse, OSU put Meyer 
on paid administrative leave 
and launched an investigation 
into Meyer’s handlings of the 
issue.At this point, all eyes were 

on the OSU football program. 
Why? Well, college football fans 
were curious about the fate of 
one of the country’s powerhouse 
football programs. But this issue 
extends far beyond the realms 
of college football. One in every 
three women will experience 
domestic abuse in her lifetime. 
During the investigation into 
Meyer, OSU had a once-in-a-
lifetime stage, an opportunity to 
send an invaluable message about 
the gravity of domestic violence 
and how much more important 
of an issue it is than winning 
football games. But, like I said 
before, OSU failed. Completely, 
utterly failed.
First off, certain OSU fans 
partied at an “Urban Meyer 
rally” and tailgated outside of 
the Board of Trustees meeting 
that determined the fate of 
Meyer’s career. This is despicable 
because it shows a desire to win 
football games at all costs, even 
if it means treating a sensitive 
issue like domestic abuse with 
carelessness 
and 
disrespect. 
However, I refuse to condemn all 
of Buckeye nation simply because 
of a few disgusting fans. I’m sure 
every program has some fans 
who would do the same thing.
When 
the 
investigation 
concluded, 
OSU 
announced 
Meyer 
made 
“insufficient” 
actions regarding Zach Smith. 
Meyer was not fired, but he 
will have to serve a three-game 
suspension. As measly as that 
punishment 
may 
sound, 
I’m 
not an investigator and I don’t 
know what Meyer knew and 
did when faced with such a 
sensitive issue. I can speculate, 
but I can’t determine whether 
OSU’s punishment for Meyer 
is appropriate. In my opinion, 
OSU’s ultimate failure comes in 
the form of Meyer’s statements 
during the press conference.
It’s important to remember 
that the OSU investigation this 
August was not an investigation 
into whether or not Zach Smith 
abused his wife. Therefore, any 
he-said-she-said surrounding the 
abuse allegations is irrelevant. 
The 
OSU 
investigation 
this 
August was about how the 
football program handled a issue 

as delicate as domestic violence. 
It’s about whether Meyer took 
the 
allegation 
seriously 
and 
went to every length he could to 
ensure it was properly reported 
and investigated, or whether he 
swept it under the rug. It’s not 
an investigation into whether 
Zach abused Courtney. It’s an 
investigation into whether, in 
the case that abuse may have 
occurred, the football program 
cares 
more 
about 
properly 
reporting abuse than it does 
about winning football games.
In 
his 
press 
conference, 
Meyer never once addressed the 
issue of domestic violence or 
mentioned Courtney Smith. He 
talked only about what a pain this 
“situation” was to him and his 
fans. He began by apologizing to 
Buckeye Nation: “I followed my 
heart, not my head.” When asked 
what he would say to Courtney 
Smith, he said, “I have a message 
for everyone in this, I’m sorry we 
are in this situation.”
I know I said earlier that my 
disdain for OSU’s recent actions 
comes from me as a human being, 
not me as a football fan, but if you 
know me, then you know that I 
live and breathe college football 
every fall. It’s nearly impossible to 
separate Hannah the football fan 
from Hannah the person. I hope 
that if a similar situation were 
to arise at Michigan, I would be 
significantly more heartbroken 
that someone was abused than 
I would be at the thought that 
Harbaugh could be fired.
Ultimately, 
though 
OSU 
significantly missed the mark 
when it comes to showing the 
seriousness of an issue like 
domestic 
violence, 
this 
past 
August should be a lesson learned 
for all of us. Do we care about 
complex, sensitive issues like 
domestic violence no matter 
what, or only when it’s good PR? 
After OSU showed how not to 
handle such an issue, let’s all look 
a little more deeply into ourselves 
and see if we would’ve handled it 
the same way.

‘They Don’t Want Our Intelligence’

ABBIE BERRINGER | COLUMNW

T

hey don’t want our 
intelligence,” 
a 
classmate 
of 
mine 
confidently 
proclaimed 
to 
our 75-person Late American 
Political Thought class last 
spring. The statement was 
followed by many nods of 
agreement from the class. 
Surprisingly 
enough, 
he 
wasn’t talking about some 
form of extraterrestrial life, 
but rather about people living 
in rural America.
Our 
discussion 
was 
on 
America’s 
invisible 
poor 
a 
topic we had been reading 
about in “The Other America: 
Poverty in the United States,” 
an acclaimed book by Michael 
Harrington 
published 
in 
1962. 
Harrington 
described 
the 
ever-growing 
economic 
divide in the country during 
the era of affluence, talking 
about how as the middle class 
grew, it was becoming farther 
removed from the realities of 
the impoverished, often rural 
or deeply urban, American 
communities. He used the 
Appalachian region as one 
example of a community that 
was not seeing the increase 
in wealth that other parts of 
America were. In a very brief 
summary that does not do the 
book any justice, he talked 
about how this inequality was 
affecting the psyches of the 
people in these communities 
and those who were blind 
to their struggles. He called 
these 
people 
“The 
Other 
America” and described the 
effect of being forgotten on 
the residents and society as a 
whole.
The student in my class’s 
response was in answer to 
the question “Why is there 
a cycle of poverty in these 
communities?” His answer 
was that these people simply 
don’t want our intelligence. 
His 
definition 
of 
“our” 
referred to the people who 
have been able to move up the 
socioeconomic ladder— those 
in the suburbs and cities who, 
in his view, made it due to 
their heightened intelligence. 
What was surprising was how 
much of our class seemed to 
agree with his statement.
If this had been the only 
time I had heard a student at the 
University of Michigan voice 
such a negative opinion about 
America’s rural class, maybe I 
would have chalked it up to one 
case of ignorance, but, on the 
contrary, I have heard many 
similar statements among my 
peers. In another conversation 
in an earlier class, I overheard 

two people discussing what 
it was like to live in a small 
town. A girl said, “I grew up in 
a small town and it was awful.” 
The boy she was talking to, in 
an attempt to connect with her, 
said, “Yeah I can imagine you 
must have wanted to get out of a 
place where people’s minds are 
so small.”
After 
the 
election 
of 
President Donald Trump in 
2016, I found myself shocked by 
some of the statements made by 
my peers describing what they 
thought anyone who voted for 
Trump must be like. Adjectives 
that I’ve heard used include but 
are not limited to: ignorant, 

stupid, bigoted, racist, evil and 
abhorrent. I felt an immense 
amount of duty to defend the 
people from rural America as 
these were my people. I grew 
up in rural communities and 
have a deep respect for the 
people in our country who 
work our farms, fix our cars, 
build our houses and keep our 
streets safe from crime.
By now, many sociologists, 
psychologists and journalists 
have taken on the task of 
looking 
into 
what 
caused 
so much of working class 
America, particularly regions 
such as the Rust Belt, which 
have 
historically 
voted 
Democrat for almost 20 years, 
to make such a drastic switch 
by voting overwhelmingly for 
Trump. Every source from 
Newsweek to CNN to USA 
Today has published articles 
citing 
various 
studies 
and 
proposing a myriad of theories.
One thing I know, however, 
is that there has been very little 
empathy in these articles for 
the people they are analyzing, 
as if they are nothing more 
than animals in a zoo to be 
evaluated and yet not truly 
with whom to be related. Often 
times these people’s feelings, 
whether they are said to be 
based on economic hardships, 
cultural concerns or some form 
of paranoia, are portrayed to be 
inherently false, not grounded 
in rational logic and out of 
touch with reality.

Yet, it is not very often 
that the people writing these 
articles have truly seemed to 
step into the shoes of these 
individuals. 
They 
draw 
a 
very hard line based on what 
they deem to be unacceptable 
political 
affiliations. 
They 
protest all over the country 
in cities like Ann Arbor that 
are touted as some of the most 
“inclusive” places to live in 
America, and yet they seem 
to have little concern with 
actually 
empathizing 
with 
a portion of the population 
large enough to come together 
and vote Trump into office as 
the president of the United 
States.
What I see on our campus 
is a deeply rooted classism 
and elitism that breeds a 
superiority complex that has 
enabled our student body to 
create an “us” and a “them”. We 
see ourselves as the educated, 
and therefore the superior 
minds. Yet, and maybe as a 
symptom of arrogant youth, 
we lack an understanding of 
how the environment and 
livelihoods 
of 
the 
people 
in these communities have 
shaped the way they think.
I have intentionally avoided 
delving into the myriad of 
theories as to why people in 
rural 
America 
believe 
the 
things they do because that 
is not the point of my article. 
Rather, my point is this: On a 
campus that preaches so much 
“tolerance,” it is undoubtedly 
hypocritical to hear people 
talk so disgracefully about 
rural 
communities 
the 
way they do. Is it okay to 
generalize 
and 
stereotype 
them because we see them as 
majority white? I certainly 
don’t think so. Is it okay to call 
them “stupid” or “ignorant” 
because they don’t have what 
we perceive as a high standard 
of education? The average 
liberal student may not say 
so considering they’d never 
make such statements about 
people from other cultures or 
of differing education systems 
because this would be seen as 
racist and culturally arrogant. 
Yet we catch ourselves saying 
these things about those in 
rural America. It is time we 
evaluate our own “tolerance” 
as well as our own perceptions 
of ourselves. If we truly are 
“the leaders and the best,” it 
is time that we realize that 
the best leaders listen to those 
who are struggling and truly 

Aretha Franklin 
was a constant 
reminder of what 
can come from a 
place like Detroit.

Comedy catharsis

COMEDY COLUMN

In the past couple of years, TV 

shows have started to portray 
mental 
health 
— 
specifically 

trauma 
and 
its 
psychological 

and physical repercussions — in 
more authentic ways than before. 
Comedies like The CW’s “Crazy 
Ex-Girlfriend” 
and 
Netflix’s 

“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” 
present 
enlightening 
and 

thought-provoking depictions of 
trauma through a humorous lens 
without resorting to superficial 
stereotyping. TV dramas, however, 
still seem to be fixated on using 
trauma as a catalyst for suspense.

Crime procedurals such as 

“Law & Order: SVU” often address 
the trauma of every episode’s 
victim through their harrowing 
testimonies, treating their painful 
experiences with admirable albeit 
somewhat surface-level reverence. 
More 
controversially, 
Netflix’s 

“13 Reasons Why” tackles trauma 
through the protagonist Hannah 
(Katherine 
Langford, 
“Love, 

Simon”), a high schooler whose 
tragic suicide is not only displayed 
in full, but the circumstances of 
which are serialized through 13 
cassette tapes made for all the 
people “responsible” for her death. 
Though its attempts to spotlight 
the detriments of trauma and 
bullying are well-intentioned and 
occasionally nuanced, watching 
“13 Reasons Why” can be almost 
too violent and melodramatic 
to stomach, especially with one 
supporting character’s unexpected 
(and unnecessarily brutal) rape in 
the season two finale.

How, then, can a show attain 

an in-depth illustration of trauma 
without dumbing it down or 
glamorizing it? In the case of 
HBO’s 
slow-burning 
murder 

mystery 
miniseries 
“Sharp 

Objects,” the portrayal of trauma is 

transfixing and meticulous, acting 
as both a recurring theme and as a 
heavily stylized aesthetic. Trauma 
itself becomes a character rather 
than a mere plot device. 

Based on the novel by “Gone 

Girl” author Gillian Flynn (who 
also wrote a few episodes for the 
series), “Sharp Objects” follows 
hard-drinking journalist Camille 
Preaker (Amy Adams, “Arrival”) 
as she returns to her hometown 
of Wind Gap, Mo. to investigate 
the murder of two young girls. 
As 
Camille 
becomes 
more 

invested in the crime, the sparse 
details surrounding her history 
of 
self-harming 
and 
troubled 

relationship with her domineering 
mother Adora (Patricia Clarkson, 
“Delirium”) gradually come to 
light.

Rather than exploit Camille’s 

trauma for the sake of spectacle, 
“Sharp Objects” deftly underscores 
Camille’s 
fraught 
emotional 

interiority through the show’s 
disjointed editing, out-of-context 
flashbacks and disorienting sound 
design. These techniques certainly 
elicit a build-up of dread and 
terror. But more importantly, they 
are not made to entertain; they 
deliberately immerse the viewer 
into Camille’s fragile state of mind.

Each scene in which Camille 

finds a clue to the crime, spots 
a curious object or recognizes a 
familiar face, she’s transported 
into her adolescence, her memories 
of which are paradoxically lucid 
and spotty. During some of these 
moments, the atmospheric sound 
from the scene set in the present 
— usually the hypnotic noise of 
summertime crickets or heavy 
breathing 
— 
remains, 
while 

the sound from the scene set in 
the past is erased completely. 
The 
vivid 
parallels 
between 

Camille’s 
fractured 
past 
and 

equally unstable present signify 
her inability to reconcile the 
unresolved issues of her childhood 

(and even adulthood) trauma. It’s 
a smart, riveting and haunting 
way of showing that trauma is a 
very real, inescapable wound, an 
eternal, ominous specter that can 
only be vanquished once it’s faced 
head-on. 

This, of course, isn’t the first 

time this kind of depiction has been 
executed. “Sharp Objects” director 
Jean-Marc Vallée (“Demolition”) is 
known for incorporating a similar 
evocation of trauma in his other 
acclaimed HBO miniseries “Big 
Little Lies,” wherein young mother 
Jane Chapman (Shailene Woodley, 
“Adrift”) experiences a slew of 
intense flashbacks to her rape a few 
years before moving to the seaside 
town of Monterey, Cali. Similar to 
“Sharp Objects,” “Big Little Lies” 
focused less on how Jane’s trauma 
and emotional troubles could be 
used as a marker for tension and 
more on how it informed who she 
was as a character.

Netflix’s “Jessica Jones” also 

gives a notable take on trauma, 
wherein the titular superhero 
(Krysten Ritter, “Marvel’s The 
Defenders”) uses her superhuman 
strength 
(both 
physical 
and 

emotional) to combat her inner 
turmoil 
from 
witnessing 
the 

death of her family, as well as 
the evil forces that threaten to 
destroy her and the world at large. 
Though “Jessica Jones” doesn’t 
shy away from explicit violence, it 
manages to remain grounded by 
emphasizing Jessica’s struggles 
and 
eventual 
triumph 
over 

controlling her PTSD.

A topic like trauma is as difficult 

to talk about in real life as it is 
difficult to translate on screen. 
Luckily, “Sharp Objects” and 
programs like it operate as complex 
models for how trauma can be 
properly discussed and dissected 
on TV — and perhaps they can also 
further the conversation of coming 
to terms with the hard truths that 
dictate our own inner lives.

TV NOTEBOOK

Thanks for turning to this 

page, clicking on this link or 
picking this particular piece 
of paper off the gum that has 
been stuck to the bottom of 
your shoe since day one of 
Welcome Week. But enough 
about you, this column is about 
me. I wanted to write a humor 
column because comedy has 
always been a form of catharsis 
for me, a way to let go of things 
and just laugh. Ever since I was 
a chubby kid in the chorus of 
every JCC community theater 
play from 2005 to 2010, I turned 
to making others laugh in order 
to make myself feel better. I 
was overweight and not even 
talented enough to play one of 
Tevye’s irrelevant daughters 
(their names are Bielke and 
Shpritzke, and I am proud that 
I didn’t even need to look that 
up). So, cracking up the cast 
backstage was the only way to 
get the attention I craved and 
most certainly deserved. My 
hope for you, dear reader, is that 
you find some catharsis with 
this column as well. Perhaps, 
between stressing about class 
and stressing about love and 
stressing about stress, you can 
read my carefully crafted prose 
and giggle, smile or grimace, 
and let go of something keeping 
you down. 

This 
column 
is 
an 

experiment: An amalgamation 
of my own perverse mind farts 
and 
unwelcome 
suggestions 

from my mother that combine 
to craft a piece of journalism 
so hysterical that President 
Schlissel 
himself 
will 
add 

it to his stack of required 
morning reading. I may have 
high hopes for this column, 
but don’t be discouraged by 

my cockiness, dear reader, I 
am, in fact, terrified that no 
one, not even Schlissel, will 
laugh at my column. However, 
I promise you, no matter how 
un-funny this column ends up 
becoming, I swear I will keep 
writing it until, of course, I 
decide to stop writing it or 
my editor commands me to do 

so. Consider this a contract 
of sorts, a way to hold both 
you and me responsible. I, as 
writer of this column, vow 
to provide you with funny 
content that may be deeply and 
uncomfortably personal while 
occasionally offering my expert 
and valid opinions on the state 
of comedy today. While, you, 
dear reader, must do your due 
diligence in not hurting my 
feelings because I am honestly, 
like, really sensitive, so if you 
have a negative review of this 
column please try your best to 
sandwich the insult with praise 
so the mean stuff doesn’t hurt 
so bad. I respond really well to 
positive reinforcement, so keep 
the compliments flowing and 
criticism minimal because my 
self-esteem is, like, really, really 

low and I just don’t know if I can 
handle a hit like that right now. 
I mean, there is this guy… and 
I just read a really sad article 
about dead puppies… and the 
economy… so I feel like I really 
can’t handle any negativity 
right now. You know how the 
spoonful of sugar makes the 
medicine go down? I want you 
to flatter me before you tear 
me to shreds. That pretty much 
covers your end of the deal. In 
summation, I will try to make 
you laugh and you should really 
try to not be a dick. I mean, I 
am really putting myself out 
there with this thing. So a little 
respect would be nice.

As a woman (since the age 

of 11, thanks Aunt Flo) I have 
heard time and time again 
that I have to censor myself. 
I should be less loud so as not 
to threaten potential mates. I 
should be less silly as to seem 
more attractive to potential 
mates. I should be less myself 
as to more easily attain and 
hold 
onto 
potential 
mates. 

Comedy has given me the outlet 
and confidence to hold nothing 
back and to put it all out there, 
potential mates be damned. 
Comedy is about making others 
laugh at you before they laugh 
about you. Comedy should be 
cathartic. It should be a release 
— a breath of fresh, hilarious air 
that reminds you that there are 
more reasons to laugh than cry. 
That chubby girl in the chorus 
still lives in a really messy attic 
with “Twilight” posters on the 
walls and a collection of feather 
boas. She is somewhere deep 
in my subconscious, but she 
is still there. She is desperate 
and eager to make you laugh 
to make herself feel better. So 
humor me, dear reader, and 
stick with me on this wild 
experiment, you might get a 
laugh out of it.

NOW.

When I get past the gates, I am 

immediately overwhelmed, my 
sight overloaded by summer citrus 
colors and the blurs of passing 
faces. My only prior experience 
with a music festival was Loufest, 
which now seemed fairly podunk 
and lame in comparison. There 
is stimulation in every direction. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
frankly 

massive crowd and eight main 
stages, there is the FYE Music 
Experience Tent, the Bud Light 
Dive Bar, the Fruit of the Loom 
Human Claw Experience, the 
Cupcake 
Vineyards’ 
Poptail 

Shop, Neighborhood of Good® 
Brought to You by State Farm® 
and the Toyota Sienna Festivan 
Wonderland 
Presented 
by 

SiriusXM, as well as a dizzying 
array of local restaurant booths. 
Feeling a little paralyzed by all the 
options, I decided that while I wait 
for my friends to arrive, I would 
check out the press lounge. I can’t 
pretend that it didn’t feel good to be 
able to flash my credentials at the 
burly sunglasses-sporting guard 
as I walked into the restricted 
area, but that feeling of confidence 
was quickly displaced by a strong 
sense that I did not belong in this 
world of lanyards and golf carts 
and professionalism. I relieve 
the press lounge of some of their 
complimentary drinks and am on 
my way.

I receive word that I am to meet 

my friends at the Perry’s stage, the 
designated home of most EDM acts 
at Lollapalooza. The first thing 
I notice is the stench: The whole 
field was suffused with an odor 
I can only describe as biological. 
The second thing I notice is the 
distinctive nature of the crowd at 
Perry’s, which appeared to have 
the lowest median age and the 
highest median family income of 
any stage (also, I would wager, the 
highest volume of body glitter per 
capita). London on da Track was 
performing a DJ set and doing 
a pretty good job of it, his hip-
hop-based sound going over well 
with the young Lollapaloozians. I 
(briefly) joined a mosh pit, which, 
while certainly of a bizarrely 
milquetoast variety given the 
crowd and environment, was fun 
nevertheless.

After some difficult scouring in 

a remarkably homogeneous crowd 
of Lollapaloozians, I’m able to find 
my friends from home along with 
a blue-jawed, shirtless man I don’t 
recognize — one comes up and 
whispers to me that his name was 
Hunter and that he bought them 
drinks and that as a direct result 
he was to be our friend for the time 
being. One of my friends vouched 

for his character by informing 
me that he had yet to drug them. 
This turn of events did not end up 
bothering me as much as I thought 
it would — he turned out to be 
quite the entertaining character. 
Hunter had a psychedelic tank 
top of a lurid metallic hue that 
put all other colors to shame (I 
say “had” rather than “wore” as it 
spent most of its time tied around 
his backpack rather than on his 
torso). He wore a hat to cover 
his heavily receding hairline. I 
don’t think I ever saw him take 
off his sunglasses. Hunter was a 
self-described professional drug 
dealer in his thirties who viewed 
himself as a festival veteran. His 
duty was to help everyone else 
have fun. He came alone. While 
at first his behavior seemed 
obsequious, as I became more and 
more intoxicated off of the free 
alcohol he provided us I started 
finding him to be better company. 
Hunter possessed many peculiar 
mannerisms, including but not 
limited to a tendency to skip as his 
mode of transportation whenever 
he went off to buy us more $30 
plastic bottles of wine and a 
strangely servile attitude (such 
as picking up all the trash on the 
street around us when we sat down 
on the curb to eat). When I pressed 
him on this, he reassured me that 
“it was his job” to ensure that we 
had a good time. He refused to 
accept payment for the alcohol, 
claiming to have made over 
$8,000 that week alone. While 
he was ostensibly quite friendly, 
there was something undeniably 
unctuous about Hunter, and I 
can’t say that I was disappointed 
when we parted ways.

We arrive at Billie Eilish, who I 

will admit I was very excited for. 
She drew what was apparently 
an unexpectedly large crowd, as 
she was placed on the fairly small 
Tito’s stage.

When we got there, it was 

her brother Finneas on stage 
performing an unknown solo 
song of his. This was not a crowd-
pleasing number — they had 
clearly come to see Billie, not her 
brother. His stage presence was 
overly serious and unintentionally 
comical.

Eilish’s performance, however, 

was not a great one either. Her 
vocals seemed enervated and 
her stage persona was eye-roll-
inducing. I overheard a significant 
amount 
of 
Lollapaloozians 

complain of boredom as they 
left, despite the fact that a great 
portion of the crowd was filled 
with adulating fans who knew 
every word to every song. I think 
at least 90 percent of the crowd 
was singing along when she played 
“Ocean Eyes.” I’ll forgive Billie 
Eilish for her rather affected stage 

presence given her inexperience 
and young age (at 16, I was trying 
to figure out how to smoke weed 
out of an apple and spray painting 
the walls of parking garages). At 
the same time, I wish I had gone 
to see CHVRCHES instead.

Travis Scott was one of the most 

anticipated shows of the night, 
both due to the imminent release 
of the long-hyped Astroworld 
and his infamous reputation as 
a live performer — last time he 
performed at Lollapalooza, he 
was arrested after inciting a riot 
a mere five minutes into his set. 
The atmosphere was electric. I 
was at a level of drunken vigor 
that was perfect for the occasion, 
and someone dished me out 
some apple-flavored vodka out 
of a lotion bottle — things were 
starting to shape up nicely.

He opened with “Stargazing,” 

a single off Astroworld released a 
day or two ago that a great deal of 
the crowd already knew the words 
to. “Mamacita” and “Dark Knight 
Dummo” were the highlights of 
the show, both Travis and the 
crowd utterly fervid. 

It was a performance with 

high highs and low lows, the 
lows mainly consisting of Travis 
slowing the momentum with 
a few bemusing moments of 
protracted 
crowd 
interaction. 

The first involved a guy named 
Steve in a Phoenix Suns jersey 
who managed to get up on stage 
— at first Travis told him to do a 
stage dive, later recanting this 
suggestion after what looked 
like some intense thought led 
him to realize that Steve could 
not execute such a stunt without 
serious bodily injury. Steve, for 
what it’s worth, absolutely blew 
his shot by ignoring Travis’s 
increasingly urgent entreaties to 
stop trying to take pictures with 
him, slowly but surely drawing 
the snarling ire of both Travis 
and the crowd. Steve’s time in 
the spotlight lasted around five 
minutes, ending with a half-
assed stage dive that pleased no 
one. The second baffling event 
involved a man Travis brought 
up on stage who went on some 
extended, indecipherable rant that 
concluded with him proposing to 
his girlfriend who was apparently 
in attendance. I don’t think I’ve 
ever felt such acute second-hand 
embarrassment as I did for our 
friend onstage when he was 
waiting for his (potential) fiancée 
to come up — the general sentiment 
in the crowd was that she had 
dipped out. Eventually, thank god, 
she does emerge from the crowd, 
and the happy couple awkwardly 
embrace. 
“This 
a 
beautiful 

moment,” Travis muttered in such 
a way that it sounded like he was 
trying to convince himself. “Play

Astroworld!” someone yells.

Say what you will about these 

unwise interludes, one aspect 
of Travis’s character that is 
indisputable is that he cares about 
his fans and his music. He was not 
afraid to call the V.I.P. section out 
for their elitist lack of engagement; 
he seemed to interpret their lack 
of energy as a manifestation of 
feelings of superiority. He just 
wants everyone to rage. You can 
imagine him as he started out — a 
teenager alone in his dark four-
cornered room illuminated only 
by the cold light of his screen as he 
tried to get out all the fire inside 
him, just wanting to be like Kid 
Cudi.

Brockhampton attracted both 

the youngest and most zealous 
crowd I had seen so far. At one 
point, I was caught in a mosh pit 
that was led by a kid who can’t 
have been older than 14, his face 
beet-red with subtle purplish-
blue webs under his watering 
eyes formed by broken capillaries. 
There are a lot of die-hard 
Brockhampton fans out there 
apparently, and most of them 
wear checkered Vans.

Logic is a little too easy to 

dunk on, so I’ll refrain from doing 

so. I will say that he has a great 
relationship with his fans — he 
loves them and they love him. So 
at least they both have someone. 

I got a lobster corn dog. It was 

the best thing I ate all weekend. 
Grant Park had at this point taken 
on a subtle saffron hue as the sun 
set behind the jutting Chicago 
skyline, and while my friends 
all went to go see the brooding 
Weeknd, I walked across the park 
to Vampire Weekend, who I’ve 
best heard described as “a boat 
shoe you don’t hate.” It was more 
crowded than The National’s 
show but was suffering from a 
similar phenomenon of being up 
against a pop titan. Ezra Koenig 
walked out in his System of a 
Down long-sleeved tee and grey 
cargo shorts and kicked off the 
show by playing “A-Punk” three 
times in a row. It got better with 
each rendition and the crowd got 
progressively wilder. This was the 
most Vampire Weekend-esque 
way they could have opened the 
show, and frankly, I’m here for it.

They played their classics with 

consummate 
elegance, 
every 

song well-received by the crowd. 
Their personality burst through 
in little jocular moments such as 

a brief bass solo that included the 
“Seinfeld” theme song.

Vampire Weekend felt fresh 

off of a long touring hiatus, 
announcing that their fourth 
studio album was imminent (in 
the process of being mastered). 
They closed with “Walcott,” a fan 
favorite.

ODESZA is quite possibly the 

best live performance I have 
ever seen, the production value 
surpassing that of any other artist 
I saw all weekend. They opened 
with “Intro/A Moment Apart,” 
replete with triumphant brass 
additions and bright white lights 
that gave the performance a near-
baptismal effect. Their already 
cinematic music was made even 
more so through the strategic 
use of a drum line and other live 
orchestration. Each song was 
accompanied by synced visuals; 
glitched-out celestial graphics, 
flashes 
and 
specks 
dancing 

across the screen, occasional 
pyrotechnics in moments that 
carried 
particular 
climactic 

weight. It was beautiful, and a 
fitting conclusion to my time in 
Grant Park. 

Four days at Lollapalooza: A supposedly fun thing 
I will probably do again

Hawkins settled in as replacement for Metellus

Sophomore 
safety 
Brad 
Hawkins saw the ball go up. He 
turned his hips, his eyes fixated 
on the opportunity that he’d 
long awaited.
“(I) thought it was mine,” 
Hawkins said Tuesday.
Of course, it wasn’t. 
Instead, Notre Dame receiver 
Chris Finke leapt over Hawkins’ 
back, 
snatching 
a 
43-yard 
touchdown 
that 
sent 
the 
stadium into a frenzy and gave 
the Irish a 14-0 lead halfway 
through the first quarter, a lead 
Notre Dame carried through 
the end of the game Saturday.
“He Moss’d him,” exclaimed 
television commentator Mike 
Tirico, referencing a play hall-
of-fame receiver Randy Moss 
might make. Finke is 5-foot-10, 
half a foot shorter than Moss.
Four plays after replacing 
junior safety Josh Metellus, 
who was ejected for targeting, 
the 6-foot-2 Hawkins found 
himself the victim of a surefire 
poster. It was far from the 
auspicious start Hawkins might 
have imagined after countless 
hours 
honing 
his 
coverage 
skills, lifting in the weight 
room, watching film.
Defensive 
coordinator 
Don 
Brown 
simply told him 
he’d make the 
play next time, 
that all he can 
do is move on. 
At 
halftime, 
Hawkins spoke 
with 
Metellus 
who relayed a 
similar message. 
Hawkins saw the game as his 
opportunity — one that some 
never see. He wasn’t going to let 
a single play derail that.
“It happens,” Hawkins said. 
“I moved on to the next play, 
and I continued to play the way 
I know I’m capable of playing. … 
I definitely was surprised, but it 
happens.”
Hawkins 
came 
into 
the 

program as the 66th-ranked 
receiver 
in 
the 
country, 
according 
to 
247Sports’ 
composite ranking. But when 
he got on campus, Brown 
approached 
him 
with 
a 
proposition.
Brown asked Hawkins to 
do something most with that 
pedigree would scoff at; he 
wanted him to switch to the 
defensive side of the ball. Far 
from opposition, Hawkins was 
eager to make 
the move — in 
fact, he’d decided 
during his senior 
year at Suffield 
Academy in New 
Jersey in 2016 
that his future 
would be best as 
a defensive back.
That’s where 
he concluded his 
size and ability 
fit best in his football future. It 
doesn’t mean the move came 
without trepidation.
“I thought I was going to be 
bad at covering,” Hawkins said, 
retrospectively, thinking about 
when he first made the move 
to defense in 2017. “Coming 
into this system, you’re playing 
man. I’d never really covered 
anybody in my life, honestly.”

Hawkins turned to Devin 
Bush Sr., on Michigan’s staff 
as a defensive analyst at the 
time, for guidance. Bush Sr. 
played safety at Florida State 
and then in the NFL for eight 
years, winning championships 
at both levels. He lent Hawkins 
some tricks of the trade during 
a freshman season in which 
Hawkins played sparsely.
“Coach Bush helped me a lot 
with my covering,” Hawkins 
said. “Just him 
playing 
in 
the 
league. He has a 
lot of experience. 
He’s 
a 
winner. 
He has a national 
championship, he 
has a Super Bowl. 
Having that type 
of mind in the 
safety room with 
you is definitely a 
help.”
With more refined technique 
and 20 extra pounds, Hawkins 
came into camp and earned 
praise from the coaching staff.
Though Metellus and senior 
safety Tyree Kinnel came into 
the spring and fall entrenched 
as the returning starting safety 
duo, Hawkins fought to claim 
the role of next man up. Sure 
enough, that became a necessity 

eight minutes into the season.
On the road in a hostile 
environment, against a top-15 
team, Hawkins was ready.
“About two plays,” he said, 
when asked how long it took 
to become comfortable. “I just 
went in there and just did my 
job. It’s something that I’ve 
been doing for the past two 
years now. I thought I was 
comfortable back there.”
For some, in the interim, the 
touchdown 
will 
mask 
all. It’s a play 
Hawkins 
should 
have 
made. 
He 
knows that.
Those 
people 
will 
then 
forget 
Hawkins’ 
six 
tackles and one 
pass deflection, 
his 
strong 
positioning 
and 
dutiful 
work 
all 
night 
in 
replacing Metellus.
His teammates are not among 
them. 
“I think he did well,” said 
sophomore 
linebacker 
Josh 
Ross. “He’s also a young guy that 
came in. But we’re all trying to 
get to the level where we’re 
above anybody and everybody.”

‘M’ cruises past Crusaders

At some point this year, the 
Michigan volleyball team will lose 
a set.
Right?
But that’s a question for another 
time. Certainly not for Tuesday 
night against Valparaiso, whom the 
20th-ranked Wolverines defeated 
in three sets (25-19, 25-13, 25-20) for 
their sixth sweep in six games this 
season.
It was a typical early-season 
takedown 
of 
an 
overmatched 
opponent, done in style. While 
the contest — especially the first 
set — was pockmarked with bouts 
of sloppy play, Michigan mostly 
did what it was expected to do, 
pummeling the Crusaders (6-2) 
into oblivion with fluid chemistry, 
formidable skill and sheer physical 
power.
Junior setter MacKenzi Welsh 
orchestrated 
the 
offense 
to 
perfection, dishing out 30 assists 
with a diverse arsenal of passes, 
while keeping the tempo smooth 
and balanced. There to turn Welsh’s 
sets into kills was an imposing front 
line led by freshman outside hitter 
Paige Jones, junior outside hitter 
Sydney Wetterstrom, senior outside 
hitter Carly Skjodt and redshirt 
junior middle blocker Cori Crocker, 
who contributed to a season-high 
.363 hitting percentage.
In particular, Crocker was nearly 
unstoppable, as the Wolverines 
recognized a glaring mismatch 
between their middle blockers and 
Valparaiso’s right out of the gate. 
So Crocker went to work, hitting 
at a .778 clip with eight kills for the 
contest.
How do you stop that if you’re 
the Crusaders — and you have 
only one starter taller than six feet, 
compared to Michigan’s five?
For the most part, you don’t. 
“Today was definitely a pretty 
obvious mismatch,” Crocker said. 
“We had a couple people that 
definitely could have dominated 
who they were matched up with.”
As Crocker feasted, her towering 
presence also opened up the outside 
for Jones (.438 hitting percentage), 

Wetterstrom (eight kills) and Skjodt 
(14). But the offensive onslaught 
didn’t stop there.
With a two-set lead in hand, 
coach Mark Rosen was able to ease 
his reserves into action in the final 
frame, as freshmen Lizzie Sadilek 
and Kayla Bair and junior Katarina 
Glavinic all contributed. Sophomore 
libero Jacqueline DiSanto also saw 
considerable playing time in relief of 
senior Jenna Lerg.
While many starters and key 
players sat for long stretches of the 
third set, Skjodt, who Rosen called 
the “glue” of the team, remained 
in throughout. Rosen described 
her presence as crucial for lineup 
consistency.
“We don’t want to have a new 
player in there with a bunch of other 
new players,” he said. “Because 
then, it’s not like they get a chance 
to acclimate to what the lineup 
is like, so we try to sparingly put 
those kids in, get them experience 
with 
veteran 
kids, 
with 
the 
experienced kids. Because that’s a 
better way to learn, and they don’t 
feel that pressure in having to do 
everything.”
The Wolverines aren’t going to 
dominate all their opponents the 
way they did Valparaiso. Not while 
competing in a Big Ten which 
claims seven teams — including 
Michigan — in the AVCA Top-25. 
As such, there’s plenty of room for 
improvement.
“I think our services could still 
get better,” Jones said. “First-ball 
contact, first serving and passing.”
Added Rosen: “We’re settling in 
on what our top group is and what 
our lineup is … (and) what our team 
is looking like.”
But then again, if there’s ever a 
good time to be patient, to ease up 
on the concern, it’s right now.
School is just getting back into 
swing. Conference play is over two 
weeks away. The Wolverines still 
haven’t dropped a set.
They’ll eventually have more 
questions to answer, but they can 
afford to take their time.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | SEPTEMBER 5, 2018


T

here are times when you just 
can’t get it right, and then 
there are times when you 

learn you haven’t been getting it right 
your entire life.

This summer I learned the difference 

between accuracy and precision. The 
lesson came in the form of a centuries-
old folk song. It’s estimated “House of 
the Rising Sun” has been covered well 
over a hundred times, and I made it my 
mission these past few months to find 
the very best version.

Copydesk is big on tradition. A 

stubborn copy editor is a good copy 
editor, and we obstinately stick to our 
stylebooks and grammar laws despite 
the fact that the greater population 
of the world wouldn’t care whether 
or not a writer used an extraneous 
comma. It’s come to my attention that 
in the music world it’s tradition to 
think the original is always the best — 
pioneering, innovative, uncorrupted by 
others’ versions and opinions. What’s 
unique about “House of the Rising 
Sun” is no one knows the original. In 
fact, all recordings today are believed 

to be covers, with the first version 
sung in a different country, possibly in 
a different language, long ago.

The Animals launched the song onto 

the global stage in 1964, inspiring 
many musicians to lift their voices to 
that recognizable A-minor pattern, 
including Kesha, Toto, The Dead 
South, Hank Williams, Jr. and Bon 
Jovi.

Other 
artists 
decided 
to 
ditch 

the chord pattern and make the 
song from scratch, producing truly 
unique renditions from a multitude of 

genres such as Jimi Hendrix’s 
psychedelic rock, Doc Watson’s 
bluegrass, Lead Belly’s Delta 
blues (titled “In New Orleans”), 
Bob Dylan’s folksy Americana, 
Jerry Reed’s outlaw country, 
Idris Muhammad’s jazzy funk 
and Muse’s heavy rock. The list 
goes on and on.

One question stuck with me 

on this quest to find the best 
cover: what’s better, precision 
or accuracy? A fascinating query 
for a neurotic copy editor. My 
job revolves around correcting 
style precision and grammar 
accuracy, but there was a lot that 
had to be analyzed and there was 
even more than meets the eye.

I define precision as how close 

a song comes to the popular 
version by The Animals. This 
definition fits the songs by 
Kesha, Bon Jovi and the others 
who use the same cyclical chord 
pattern and forces artists to 
emphasize their idiosyncrasies 
to 
create 
a 
distinct 
sound; 

therefore, it’s more about the 
artist’s interpretation of the song 
rather than a remaking of it.

The version I believe emulates 

this the best is an instrumental 
version 
by 
The 
Ventures 

recorded live in Japan in 1965. 
This particular rendition took 
the traditional chord pattern 
and broke it down throughout 
the course of the song until it 

is nearly unrecognizable through a 
beautiful and unpredictable mess of 
guitar riffs.

On the other hand, I define accuracy 

as how close the song comes to what’s 
believed to be the original lyrics. 
Because the song’s oldest published 
lyrics 
predate 
the 
song’s 
oldest 

recording, there is no original music 
genre. This definition would include 
songs that differed from The Animals’ 
accustomed rock-and-roll style.

“House of the Rising Sun” has 

been recorded in a surprisingly wide 
variety of musical genres, and its lyrics 
vary from song to song. The oldest 
published lyrics, written by Robert 
Winslow Gordon in 1925, tell the 
story from the perspective of a woman 
abused by her husband instead of the 
more popular story of a man abused 
by life. Nina Simone performed the 
original lyrics live at the Village Gate, 
New York in 1961 and, in my opinion, 
stunningly captured the sorrowful 
tale with her soft, longing voice like 
no one else. The background noises of 
people shuffling around the nightclub 
only add to the song’s overwhelming 
lonesomeness.

Put 
against 
one 
another, 
The 

Ventures’ and Nina Simone’s renditions 
are almost complete opposites. I am 
unable to choose between precision 
and accuracy because both yield such 
different yet beautiful results. I think 
this is an important lesson for all 
artists out there, and for all who edit 
artists’ work: to focus on perfection 
with respect to tradition is quite 
limiting. Both songs take something 
from the original but end up making 
another thing entirely.

This revolt against tradition doesn’t 

mean I’m about to toss my stylebook out 
the window — we still need coherence 
and consistency in our writing — but it 
is enough to make me pause. I now find 
myself more curious in the reasoning 
behind the grammar rules and style 
guidelines, and I hope this curiosity 
will make me a better editor.

Tea Leaves: I am happy to chat with you, 

just not at Starbucks

T

here are certain places I tend 
to avoid when I return to 
my hometown after a year 

away at college. The notorious town 
watering 
holes: 
June 
graduation 

parties, the grocery store on Sunday 
evenings, 
Starbucks. 
These 
three 

places can all be classified by their 
likelihood of neighborhood small talk, 
typically conversations that often 
prompt questions concerning my own 
college experience.

Still, 
I 
acknowledge 
these 

exchanges are inevitable when you 
leave a place that knows all the sticky 
PB&J crumbs of your childhood 
(including a Bangles talent show 
routine 
and 
cringeworthy 
floral 

headband phase) and then you return 
to find a local cavity of knowledge. 
So instead, I do my best to see the 
people with whom I genuinely owe 
a candid conversation, and for those 
brief interactions at the watering 
hole, I rely on my rolodex of prepared 
responses.

I 
spent 
the 
summer 
quite 

successfully adhering to my plan. 
That is, until a good friend invited 
me for a cup of coffee at the third 
destination on the list of places I avoid 
in my hometown: Starbucks. When 
she picked me up in her doorless Jeep, 
I knew that discretion was not going 
to be the vintage of this excursion.

Starbucks. The town square for 21st 

century suburban life.

Besides a corporate guarantee that 

no matter which Starbucks location 
you visit your nuanced drink order 
will taste the same, there is also a 
latent promise that you will run into 
at least three people from your life. 
Going to Starbucks is akin to posting 
a social media photo in real life. The 
experience is specifically crafted to 
let the world know you were there.

Think about it. There is a reason 

beyond caffeine that people feel the 
need to walk into a meeting with the 
ubiquitous mermaid-stamped cup in 
their hand.

The convoluted drink orders are 

like the personalized photo edit 
settings of your VSCO feed — a strange 
mix of pride and mystery veils both. 
The Lululemon clad mother in front 
of me orders, “I’ll have a caramel 
macchiato, venti, skim, extra shot, 
extra hot, extra whip, sugar free.” 
I haven’t had a “go to” Starbucks 
drink order since seventh grade 
when 
everyone 
drank 
chocolate 

chip frappuccinos. For those who 

are unfamiliar with this gem on the 
Starbucks menu, a chocolate chip 
frappuccino is what you drink when 
hot chocolate becomes a faux pas 
circa fifth grade. It is the middle 
school drink of choice. You know, 
when you need all that caffeine to 
finish reading “Crispin.”

It is my turn to order and I am 

already flustered. I have taken Spanish 
for 12 years yet my acquaintance with 
the romance languages still does not 
prove useful when trying to decode 
the Starbucks menu. “Umm, I will 
have a medium Earl Grey tea.” The 
barista is staring me down when she 
asks, “You mean a grande?” I have 
never understood the logic behind 
the Starbucks drink sizing. You would 
think “grande” would mean “large” 
but it doesn’t — it implies medium.

I reach into the depths of my Vera 

Bradley wallet (the occasion called 
for it) and hand over a dusty Starbucks 
gift card left over from a high school 
secret Santa gift exchange. “There 
are only 43 cents left on this,” the 
barista says. Forty-three cents left 
on the $5.00 gift card — matching 
the subtle five points of a star and 
the $5.00 price tag that paints the 
chalkboard menu.

The signature scent envelopes me 

as I carry the $5.00 cup of tea. The 
distinct aroma of a Starbucks — nodes 
of java beans and burnt cheese — 
become my perfume for the rest of the 
day. Everyone knows where you were 
after you spend an hour sitting in a 
Starbucks. No need for an Instagram 
geotag.

My friend chooses a seat on the 

storefront patio to soak in the dog days 
of summer before we both head back 
to school. She asks if the seat is okay, 
given her awareness of my preference 
to avoid the inevitable neighborly 
interactions of a Starbucks visit. I 
reply that the seat is perfect, mostly 
because I don’t think it is possible to 
be a fly on the wall in the bustling 
hometown coffeehouse.

I smile and nod as the overlapping 

figures of our past wave, approach 
the table and affectionately question 
us both about college. A trademark 
Midwest 
politeness 
threads 
each 

conversation, which instantly warms 
up my cold aversion to their questions, 
just like chicken noodle soup from the 
crock pot on a subzero snow day.

Admittedly, 
these 
impromptu 

college recap Q&A’s that have become 
routine upon a year at college are a 
privilege in itself. The opportunity 
to talk about personal interests and 

academic achievements are questions 
to which I am lucky to have at least 
some version of an answer. Even if 
those answers rival the incompleteness 
of the 1000-piece puzzle that sits on 
the dining room table all summer.

I asked my friend why she choose 

Starbucks as the venue for our final 
goodbyes. She laughed and explained 
how in her mind, docking in Starbucks 
for an afternoon lets everyone know 
she survived a year at college. That she 
is alive and well. She calls it “letting 
them know she has a pulse.”

As I processed her response, I 

began to wonder, maybe I had been 
viewing the genre of college recap 
conversations wrongly. We live in 
an age trademarked by the pressure 
to share with people where we are 
and what we are doing — it’s the very 
ethos of the Starbucks experience. 
But, for those brief interactions at 
the watering hole, maybe small talk 
is a rare chance to tell the Hollywood 
version of the story: to share an 
elegant, G-rated, 90-second exchange 
about the college experience. Your 
high school algebra teacher, the 
mother of kids you use to babysat 
and the peers you graduated with 
all know college is hard. Small talk 
shouldn’t be too.

worked, watching Vine compilations one 
night in Spring 2017. Sola, a local retiree 
and Pembroke Welsh corgi owner, found 
the Vines both amusing and perhaps a bit 
bewildering. They were seemingly ridic-
ulous videos that garnered hundreds of 
thousands of views.
Ngo joked anyone could post pretty 
much anything online, which they could 
then monetize and popularize — like 
Sola’s dog, Reggie, for example.
“You can make a Facebook page,” Ngo 
told him. “Something where people can 
follow Reggie.”
It was at this moment in the now-
defunct Billiards Room that the former 
junior excitedly helped Sola establish an 
avid following on campus.
The plan was to construct a Facebook 
profile for Reggie Bee, Sola’s eight-year-
old corgi that Ngo had grown to love 
through moments like these in the Bil-
liards Room and her own interest in cor-
gis.
And thus, from a spontaneous Vine-
watching session, the online profile of 
the University’s famous dog — and some 
would argue mascot — came to be.
Now, nearly a year-and-a-half later, 
everyone knows Reggie: student organi-
zations use him on their brochures, pho-

tos of him proliferate social media and, 
of course, he appears in a multitude of 
memes.
Sola loves it. For the semi-professional 
photographer, taking pictures of Univer-
sity students at some of their happiest 
moments, with his dog Reggie, brings 
him great joy.
Searching for a dog to help him if he 
ever faced a life-threatening event, Sola 
— an Air Force veteran who served out-
side of San Francisco during the Vietnam 
War — adopted Reggie six years ago and 
had him trained as a service dog. Because 
of a heart condition, Sola would rely on 
Reggie’s assistance should an event put 
Sola in danger.
Sola’s first searches for a cute canine 
companion proved fruitless. However, 
after speaking with a corgi rescue, Sola 
made up his mind to adopt one.
“There (was) a corgi up in Gaylord and 
so I called up there and the lady said to 
come on up,” Sola recalled. “So I went up 
to Gaylord, and I met Reggie, Reggie’s 
older sister Sandy Dee and two other 
labs. And this lady has had Reggie since 
he was a baby. She said she’s held him in 
her arms when he was a baby and actu-
ally fed him with a little bottle. He’s a 
well-liked dog, has all his shots and she 
has lived with him all his life. He was two 
years old and she had too many dogs so 
she needed to find someone who would 
take Reggie.”

Sola would be that person — to nurture 
and provide him an environment, and 
eventually an entire University student 
body, that would care for him deeply.
However, Reggie’s primary role is to 
be a service dog for Sola — to help him in 
case of an emergency if he happened to 
be alone or could not use his cell phone.
“If I start to have a heart event, if I’m 
in a park or something like that, he will 
go get me help,” Sola said. “He will run 
and go get somebody and they will know 
to follow him. He’s trained to do that.”
The possibility of needing to save Sola’s 
life is also why Reggie doesn’t require a 
leash. Sola explained most service dogs 
can’t be off leash.
According to the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act website, service animals 
must be harnessed unless it impedes the 
animal’s job. Such is the case for Reg-
gie. University police know Reggie well 
enough now that they don’t question why 
he is off a leash.
“Reggie was trained to be off leash 
because if he’s running through the park 
and gets his leash caught on something, 
that shuts the whole show down right 
there,” Sola said.
Fortunately, Sola has never experi-
enced a horrific event that would require 
Reggie to save his life, but he claims Reg-
gie helps everyday with companionship 
or if he hurts his foot, for example. Reg-
gie will hear his voice and come immedi-
ately to aid his owner.
“He’ll start licking and he’ll jump 
right up in my chair,” Sola said. “He’s so 
attuned to what I’m feeling, it’s unbeliev-
able. He’ll offer support. He’s basically 
coming up and licking my face because 
he wants to support me.”
But most importantly and profoundly 
for Sola, Reggie has been a positive force 
on the student body. He said it is his 
favorite part about spending time with 
Reggie.
Since he first created the Facebook 
page in March 2017, students eagerly run 
across campus to pet Reggie, the cuddly 
campus corgi, and for just a few minutes 
forget about the stresses of coursework, 
extracurriculars and social struggles. 
Rackham student Flynn Darby sur-
prised his corgi-loving girlfriend, Kinesi-
ology alum Andrea Kooistra, by bringing 
Reggie and Sola to her birthday last Octo-
ber. Medical student Mark-Anthony Lin-
gaya purchased his own corgi puppy and 
received extensive advice from Sola on 

where to purchase it. For others, seeing 
Reggie simply brightens their day.
“Reggie created his own group here, 
he fulfills a need,” Sola said. “There’s a 
student body here and they need a dog 
like Reggie. I usually just want the inter-
action to be between them and Reggie, 
because that’s therapy. That’s why we 
call him the therapy dog. I want them to 
have that experience.”
S

ola became interested in photog-
raphy when he traveled through-
out Asia, going to Vietnam, 
Thailand and the Philippines, taking por-
traits of both the scenery and people he 
met. His appreciation for photographing 
the everyday scenery overseas carried 
over to his life and passions in Ann Arbor.
For Sola, there isn’t anything drasti-
cally different about what he’s been doing 
during the past year and a half. Despite 
the creation of the Facebook page and 
students’ affinity toward his dog, he’s 
doing what he’s been doing for the past 
six years — walking around campus with 
Reggie.
When Ngo helped him develop the 
Facebook page, he had no idea how pop-
ular it would become — it eventually 
reached Facebook’s cap for 5,000 friends 
by the midpoint of summer 2017.
“I’ve been bringing him on campus 
and he goes virtually everywhere I go,” 
Sola said. “He’d walk around without the 
leash so (the students would) find this 
corgi, and say, ‘Wow what’s this?’… The 
common question even now is, ‘Do you 
own that dog?’”
Sola said he often jokes in response by 
saying, “Do you own that dog?”
Ngo, too, was particularly surprised 
how rapidly Reggie gained popularity on 
campus.
“I thought it would be popular for a 
couple days,” Ngo said. “I didn’t antici-
pate Reggie continuously being a meme. 
I never thought everybody would be like, 
‘Oh my god! It’s Reggie.’”
Ngo, who worked in the Billiards Room 
at the Union all throughout college, met 
Sola her freshman year, calling him one 
of a handful of regulars who frequented 
the historic spot on campus.
Sola was the first to initiate a conver-
sation during Ngo’s freshman year after 
seeing her laptop covered from top to 
bottom with corgi stickers.
“Michael finally walked up and said, 
‘Wait a second, I have a corgi,’” Ngo said. 
“We kept talking about how it’s so easy 

to get on campus and distract (passers-
by), just because so many people want to 
pet their dog when they’re walking. You 
know someone is going to stop and talk to 
you. And that’s when I mentioned, ‘You 
should honestly walk him through cam-
pus and you never know how many stu-
dents will stop by.’”
In the years leading up to the creation 
of the Facebook page, Ngo said, Sola loved 
seeing how happy Reggie made everyone 
around campus.
“That’s when I finally said, ‘You really 
should make a Facebook page or some-
thing. You’d get so much more show for 
your photography.’”
F

lynn Darby knew how much his 
girlfriend Andrea Kooistra loved 
corgis and Reggie in particular. 
She is a member of multiple corgi Face-
book groups and loves seeing Reggie on 
campus. Consequently, he invited Sola 
to participate in Kooistra’s 21st birthday 
festivities.
While Kooistra had seen and spent a 
great deal of time with Reggie on cam-
pus, Darby’s first encounter with Reg-
gie was when he threw her the surprise 
birthday party.
“It was a surprise,” Darby said. “And 15 
minutes before party started, (Sola) came 
and then Andrea had 15 minutes of Reg-
gie to herself. She took lots of pictures 
and then everyone came over and had a 
great time. (Sola and Reggie) ended up 
staying for about a half hour.”
Sola has seen Reggie’s impact to a dif-
ferent extent on campus; he says that 
he has begun to see more corgis around 
campus and knows three different Ann 
Arbor community members people who 
have purchased corgis since meeting 
Reggie.
One such person was Lingaya, who 
sought Sola’s advice about where to find 
a dog. Lingaya had always wanted a dog 
growing up but never had one of his own. 
It wasn’t until he neared graduation that 
he began to look into buying a puppy.
Sola offered advice on where to search 
(on Facebook) and the types of breeders 
(those who breed for temperament) to 
seek out. These tips proved invaluable 
when Lingaya finally found King, his six-
month-old puppy. King and Reggie have 
met multiple times and, according to Lin-
gaya, are great friends.
Lingaya and Sola bonded because, as 
Lingaya recalls, they spoke about spend-
ing time in the Philippines where Lingaya 
lived for a few years and Sola had visited 
on vacation. Lingaya always loved seeing 
Reggie and as a result became closer with 
Sola, too.
“One day when I saw him I went up 
to him and said, ‘Oh you have the cutest 
dog ever,’” Lingaya said. “I talked to him 
when I decided I really wanted to get a 
puppy and so I went to him with those 
questions of where to get one.”
Lingaya said Sola was extremely help-
ful and receptive.
“He even checked in to see how the 

process was going in terms of looking for 
the puppy, which I really appreciated,” 
he said. “You could also tell he was really 
looking out for me because he didn’t want 
me to fall into trap to the scams that hap-
pen when you get a new puppy.”
Business senior Maureen Wu is always 
excited to see Reggie on campus.
“I like Reggie because it’s nice to see 
a cute and friendly face on the middle of 
the Diag,” Wu said. “He and his owner 
are always super friendly.”
Engineering senior Justin Pawloski 
loves seeing Reggie because he said it 
brings him joy and fulfillment.
“Reggie inspired me to be who I am 
today,” Palowski said. “He’s just such a 
cute and little corgi. He should’ve been 
president, he is the greatest of all time.”
Sola hopes Reggie continues to impact 
the campus.
“Hopefully, this will become Corgi 
Campus,” Sola said with a smile. “What 
if there were just 10 corgis that were just 
periodically going through the campus?”
Some may reason that petting a dog 
for just a few minutes hardly qualifies 
as therapy. Sola though, would disagree, 
and he has the evidence to prove it.
“I’ve had mothers (of University stu-
dents), actually, a number of times, 
message me to tell me how grateful and 
how thankful they are that I bring Reg-
gie down here because their daughter or 
their son is having a horrible semester,” 
Sola said. “They’re stressed and every 
time they see Reggie they have a good 
day.”
In fact, Sola has been approached about 
partnering with mental health organiza-
tions on campus. For Sola though, Reg-
gie’s role on campus is unique and best 
independent from existing mental health 
support organizations, where he believes 
their resources exhaust what Reggie 
could offer.
“I’m retired, so I have the time to 
walk around here, walk around campus, 
then go home and process the pictures,” 
Sola said. “You see everybody walking 
through the Diag and they’re all happy 
and everything, but in their 
mind they’re worrying about 
their tests or their relation-
ships or their finances. I’ve 
learned that. Reggie’s clientele 
is the students on campus. And 
I think I’d rather keep it that 
way, too.”
Other students like Lingaya 
believe Reggie truly has clout 
on campus. Some people on 
campus might not know Shea 
Patterson plays quarterback 
for the Michigan Wolverines, 
but everyone seems to know 
Reggie, whether you’ve just 
begun at the University or are 
in your final year.
“Reggie’s a member of the 
community,” Lingaya said. “I’d 
even go as far to say that he 
is a celebrity. Most people on 

campus know who Reggie is even if they 
haven’t seen him. People who haven’t 
seen him want to see him, people who 
have seen him want to see him again. 
It’s the smile that stays. It actually helps 
their mental health and mental well-
being which I think is why people have 
accepted Reggie.”
P

art of what makes Reggie such a 
staple of campus is his accessi-
bility. Because Reggie is not on 
a leash, he can roam freely around the 
Diag and other parts of the U-M campus 
essentially untamed.
The students have grown to enjoy this 
aspect of their favorite campus corgi.
“I think it’s welcoming that he’s not on 
a leash,” Kooistra said. “Because if a dog 
is on a leash, it’s kinda intimidating to 
go up and ask if you can pet the dog, but 
since Reggie is so free roaming, it’s just 
very inviting to go and pet.”
When scrolling on facebook, posts can 
seem monotonous. There is the off-kilter 
political post from your crazy uncle, an 
infinite amount of pictures from last 
week’s tailgate and random memes your 

little brother tags you in. Yet through 
it all, there is Reggie the Campus Corgi 
pictured with smiling students, who for a 
moment lack a care in the world.
“It’s such a charismatic figure to look 
forward to on your timeline,” Kooistra 
said. “It’s the reason why I think it was 
shared so many times and seen by so 
many people.”
As Welcome Week comes to an end and 
Syllabus Week turns to midterm season, 
Reggie Bee and Michael Sola will be there 
waiting. Reggie will be on the Diag or 
near the Union, roaming and stoking out 
treats from friendly and upbeat students. 
Sola will be there too, sitting on a bench 
some feet away, just as eager to spark up 
conversation with U-M students.
It may be worth speaking to him or 
spending time with Reggie.
It may just make you want your own 
dog, or — if you’re lucky — spend time 
with him on your birthday.
Lingaya sums it up best: “I feel like 
now Michigan isn’t Michigan without 
mentioning Reggie.”

Wednesday, September 5, 2018 // The Statement
6B
Conditional love from tiger parents

“T

hank you for applying 
to the Stephen M. Ross 
School of Business. We 

regret to inform you that you have not 
been admitted to the Class of 2020. 
We encourage you to apply again next 
Winter...”

Rather than a boozy, relaxed year 

of skipping classes and taking blow-
off courses, autumn of 2015 would 
launch my toughest year yet. After 
running a three-year marathon of 
extracurriculars, AP classes and a set 
of parents perpetually disapproving my 
efforts, the end was nowhere in sight: 
It was finally time to apply to colleges, 
and it was going to be my year. With 
undying ardor, I chased the forbidden 
parental words: “I’m proud of you.”

I’ve had the same circle of friends 

since kindergarten — that seemed to 
be the way of the land back home. We 
did everything together, from taking 
the same classes to sleeping over at 
the same houses. But this foundational 
common ground soon became grounds 
to compete upon. With the ACT season 
closing and college application season 
commencing, many turned our backs 
against each other, whispering tidbits 
of envy and contempt to one another.

“Did you hear that Jack went to the 

Dartmouth information session? Like, 
there’s no way…”

“You don’t really believe Christine 

got a 36, right? She’s been insecure 
since like fifth grade about this stuff…”

The race for valedictorian-esque 

titles became tighter, and most chose 
the challenge over our friendships. 
What once was a unified group of 10 
nerds soon became three exclusive 
cliques, broken up by ACT scores and 
desired school admissions. Our lunch 
hour became grounds for subtle insults 
of one another’s intelligence, creating 
exclusive Saturday night plans in 
front of those uninvited and a tireless 
game 
of 
one-upping 
each 
other’s 

accomplishments. The sleepovers got 
smaller. The carpools disappeared. 
My phone buzzed less, until it became 
every man for himself.

My parents are immigrants from 

India: 
The 
only 
people 
in 
long 

generations of family history to escape 
their hometowns and establish a life via 
the American Dream. I always felt they 
assimilated with me, growing up while 
I did, navigating the United States. 
I grew up getting spanked, teaching 
my parents how sleepovers work and 
begging them not to make me perform 
a walk of shame out of Health class, 
sitting out of the sex module while my 

peers snickered at how much of a prude 
I appeared to be at 13.

My parents grew up in households of 

tradition, beatings and strict allegiance 
to academia. Extracurriculars came 
third in a tier of school and family, and 
fun was a taboo rather than an element 
of growing up. School was their religion, 
and I largely owe my success today to 
their undying allegiance to education. 
But alongside their expectations stood 
an everlasting custom of verbal abuse. 
A good grade meant you can always 
do better. A bad grade led to week-
long silent treatments and outcries of 
wishing they had a daughter with value, 
a daughter they wouldn’t regret having.

Because of this regular familial event, 

fear largely drove my motivations. 
Committing mistakes as I grew older 
drove them into worsening abuse. The 
comments got harsher. Their demands 
got stronger. I soon found myself with 
a 9:00 p.m. curfew at 17 years old, 
getting my phone 
confiscated and a 
string of damaging 
insults for pulling 
into the driveway 
at 9:02 p.m. after 
marching 
band 

rehearsal. 
Their 

outcrys 
shattered 

my 
composure 

each 
time, 
my 

12-year-old 
sister 

growing to be the 
only person who 
kept me alive for 
the next morning.

Between parents 

whose 
expectations 
replaced 
my 

oxygen and friends who were no longer 
friendly, I decided to let my anticipated 
college acceptances lift me into the now 
foreign concept of happiness. I knew 
that each acceptance would bring me 
closer to my parents, and hopefully new 
beginnings. But this utopia of thought 
would slowly, and surely, be destroyed.

Spring break of 2016: A family 

vacation to Barcelona. They call it rush 
hour, but it felt far from. En route to the 
airport, I received five emails within a 
single hour.

Cornell University: We regret to 

inform you…

Harvard University: Thank you for 

your interest…

Yale University: This year’s pool was 

the most competitive...

New York University: Thank you for 

applying to the Fall 2016…

Georgetown 
University: 
The 

admissions team thanks you for your 

interest...

My parents expressed intense levels 

of disappointment in my inability to 
impress the nation’s finest universities.

I had gotten into the University of 

Michigan months prior, but this didn’t 
make my parents blink an eye.

“Everyone gets into Michigan around 

here. It’s just a public school. Now 
you’re no better.”

Up to 10 college rejections later, my only 

plan was the University of Michigan. 
But there was an 11th that remained: 
Ross School of Business. I put my utmost 
time and emotional investment into 
my Business School application, and 
felt the pressure of hope deepening 
each day of April, awaiting fate in my 
inbox. Perceiving Business School to be 
more “prestigious” than the rest of the 
University, I came to see it as the key 
to my parents’ approval. I convinced 
myself that this could be how I finally 
rise to true value in my parent’s eyes, 

and 
ultimately 

bring some form 
of peace to my 
household.

And then I got 

the email.

For the rest of 

the year, I would 
cry 
myself 
to 

sleep, 
withdraw 

myself from all of 
my 
friendships, 

declare 
myself 

rebellious to my 
parents’ wishes, 
and 
let 
their 

daily 
reminder 

of my failures seep into my blood and 
flow into my most controlling thoughts 
and dreams. The girl who won “Most 
Optimistic” in high school marching 
band lost her faith in God, her 
friendships, her parents and the sight 
of herself.

Summer 2016 consisted of my first 

internship for which my parents would 
eventually accept me leaving the house. 
But once I came home, I was confined. 
Newly 
rekindled 
friendships 
were 

quickly put out by an unmoving curfew. 
Silent 
treatments 
were 
incessant. 

Prayers for happiness were denied. Ann 
Arbor quickly became the enchanted 
light I dreamed about finding at the end 
of a relentless tunnel — especially when 
it meant I could apply to the Business 
School one last time. My parents 
begged me not to attend the University 
of Michigan, their pleas deriving from 
fear to be let down again by another 
rejection letter if I reapplied. My 

resilient sister and poetry journal kept 
me sane, becoming the only things that 
kept me out of depression.

Imprisoned in a home where I was 

not welcome and having no outlet to 
vent to but to my sister, I poured the 
only energy I had into hope, hope that 
the grass was greener in Ann Arbor.

Move-in day. The sun was brighter 

and my steps were lighter. The air 
smelled sweeter, absorbing parental 
complaints before my ears could. 
Symbols of freedom decorated my 
clothing and room decor: bright yellow 
block M’s. Just a 90-minute drive stood 
between me and the rest of my life.

I could feel a chapter closing in the 

air — or perhaps it was just postponed. 
All I had was all I ever really wanted: 
a fresh slate for new friendships, 
hopes, 
whirlwinds 
and 
hopefully, 

accomplishments.
I 

persisted through two semesters 
of snarky remarks and doubts 
of my second admittance to 

the Business School on the other line. 
Then, in the middle of a meeting on the 
first day of my internship, I refreshed 
my email.

“Congratulations! You have been 

admitted … ”

I ran on unadulterated adrenaline 

for the rest of the day, and finally 
called my parents after work, who 
finally uttered, “We are proud of you” 
on the other side of the line.

This was the first stepping stone 

toward an authentic relationship with 
my parents. In a deliberate effort to 
cultivate a more personal relationship, 
I began to steer topics during phone 
calls home toward my personal life 
and admitting small failures. Shifting 
conversation from academia and grades 
to dating and dealing with stress 
resulted 
in 
unforeseen 
friendship 

with my mom and long, nourishing 
conversations with my dad.

Though a measure of my parents’ 

love 
was 
never 
what 
you’d 
call 

unconditional, 
their 
expectations 

always served as a barrier growing 
up, culminating into which university 
I’d leave the house for. Though an 
unhealthy basis for our relationship, 
it is a product of their own upbringing 
to which I owe, in part, where I am 
today. I haven’t yet addressed my 
grievances with how they treated me 
in high school in contrast to now, but I 
endure in the ambition of changing the 
only parenting style they know, hoping 
to eventually shift their mark of value 
from rank and numbers to simply love. 
And perhaps that day will come.

D

ec. 30, 2016: I’m watching 
the Michigan football team 
play in the Orange Bowl 

when Head Coach Jim Harbaugh 
starts wildly clapping, clipboard in 
hand. I turn to my dad and shout, 
“Jim Harbaugh claps like a seal!” 
Then I take to Twitter and retweet 
everyone saying the same thing.

I had been accepted into the 

University of Michigan about a week 
before, but this was the first real 
bond I felt with my future school. 
See, Harbaugh and I have something 
in common: We both made fools of 
ourselves by clapping incorrectly on 
national TV.
J

uly 4, 2011: I’m sitting on 
my couch, family gathered 
around, 
watching 
myself 

on “Jeopardy!” Being on the kids’ 
version of the quiz show was a dream 
that had materialized out of nowhere, 
one I thought would never happen. 
And yet, here I was, watching my TV 
debut.

On TV, I hit a Daily Double and 

began clapping, as is customary on 
the show. But instead of clapping like 
my competitors, like a normal person, 
I held my hands perfectly straight and 
parallel to each other and clapped, 
well, like a seal.

I put my head in my hands, unable 

to watch.

The first thing no one tells you 

about being on a quiz show: Watching 
yourself on TV isn’t fun. It’s a 
cringefest made infinitely worse once 
you realize millions of people are 
watching it.

I was self-conscious about the way 

I clapped from then on. Hey, at least 
Harbaugh is good company.

My 
second-place 
finish 
netted 

$2,000 and 15 new friends (the other 
contestants from my tape day — they 
tape a whole week of shows in one 
session). Not bad for a day’s work. But 
after that, I came to the realization 
that maybe I would never do anything 
that cool again. I was washed up at 
the age of 12.

Still, I had been on a quiz show, and 

that itself was something I could use 
to my advantage — or so I thought. A 
year after my show aired, I moved to 
Michigan where I would start eighth 
grade not knowing anyone. Everyone 
already had their friends, so I needed 
a way to stand out.

By my second week, the entire grade 

might as well have known. I got the 
attention I wanted, but there would 
be 
unintended 
consequences. 
By 

making my “Jeopardy!” appearance 
the first thing anyone knew about 
me, I was basing my identity around 
it — an identity I would later realize I 

didn’t want.

The second thing no one tells you 

about being on a quiz show: You’re 
quizzed 
about 
your 
experience. 

Constantly.

“How did you get on the show?” 

(Online test, in-person audition, lots 
of luck.)

“What’s Alex Trebek like?” (We 

barely interacted with him, but nice 
I guess.)

“Is your episode online?” (No, 

thank god.)

And of course, “Did you win?” (The 

conversation usually ended when I 
said no.)

The third thing no one tells you 

about being on a quiz show: There 
comes a point when the show becomes 
your identity, and at that point it 
almost becomes out of your control.

There were no words I dreaded 

more from a teacher than, “We’re 
playing 
Review 
‘Jeopardy!’ 
this 

week.” 
Review 
“Jeopardy”! 

was 
usually 
a 
PowerPoint 
with 

“Jeopardy!”-style questions where 
teams competed for extra credit 
right before a test. Every time, all my 
classmates — some of whom I barely 
knew — raced to be on a team with 
me, convinced I would lead them to 
victory and the ever-important extra 
credit points, never mind that Review 
“Jeopardy!” requires very different 
skills from actual “Jeopardy!”. A win 
was meaningless because of how I 
had been used. A loss meant I had let 
everyone down.

Being introduced to people often 

followed a script: “Hi, this is Aria, 
and she was on 
‘Jeopardy!’” 
It 

was cool, until 
my appearance 
got further and 
further in the 
rearview mirror 
and I was dying 
to be known for 
something else. 
Anything else.
T

oward the 
end of my 

freshman 
year 

of high school, 
I 
discovered 

Twitter. 
It 

wasn’t 
long 

before 
my 

curiosity 
got 

the 
better 
of 

me and I looked 
up tweets from 
the day of my 
“Jeopardy!” 
appearance. 
I 

had to see what 
people had said.

“What the hell they got this 

little girl dressed in?” one tweet 
said. “Looking like a freeze-dried 
strawberry?”

“Aria looks like Gilbert Gottfried,” 

read another.

And then, sure enough: “This little 

girl Aria on ‘Jeopardy!’ claps like a 
seal.”

They were supposed to be insults, 

that much I knew. But here I was, 
years removed from my 15 minutes 
of fame, and all I could do was laugh. 
The mean tweets were ridiculous and 
overblown, but I could see a kernel 
of truth in them, and that was all the 
ammunition I needed to reclaim my 
identity.

I did something I hadn’t been able 

to for years: rewatch my episode. I 
found the exact moment that spawned 
the “claps like a seal” tweet. I made 
it into a Vine, which I subsequently 
posted on Twitter. It was my pinned 
tweet for almost two years.

The Vine was a joke, yes. But I didn’t 

make it to own the haters, at least not 
really. I made it because it finally 
gave me control over the narrative. If 
I was going to be washed up, at least I 
could make fun of myself for it.
O

nce I got to college, I realized 
that people didn’t have to 
know about “Jeopardy!” –– 

so I didn’t tell them. In Introduction 
to Psychology we played Review 
“Jeopardy!”. My team was a random 
group of people who sat near me. We 
didn’t win and they didn’t care. It was 
refreshing.

When people did find out I had 

been on “Jeopardy!”, it was usually 
because they’d gone to my Twitter 
and seen the Vine. We’d laugh about 
it together, but the pressure was 
gone, because I was no longer “that 
girl who was on ‘Jeopardy!’”

Instead, I was Aria: Amateur sports 

writer, Twitter addict, U-M student. 
“Jeopardy!” was a thing I had done, 
but as it faded further and further 
into the past, it became less and less 
a part of who I was. Maybe getting 
bylines in a student newspaper isn’t 
quite as cool as being on a quiz show, 
but it’s close.

It took a surprisingly long time for 

me to unpin the tweet about clapping 
like a seal, because it had become 
as much a part of me as my original 
appearance on the show. But it was 
the moment I realized I didn’t need it 
anymore — that I didn’t have to dwell 
on the past to find something I was 
proud of — that I started to feel like 
maybe I hadn’t peaked after all.

Nowadays, 
my 
pinned 
tweet 

isn’t about “Jeopardy!” It’s about 
my favorite stories I wrote while 
covering softball for The Daily.

Of course, I haven’t left my quiz 

show days totally behind. It’s still 
in my Twitter bio, and sometimes, 
people still find out, and they ask me 
about it, the same gamut of questions 
I’ve gotten for seven years now. But 
it’s different.

“Wait, you were on ‘Jeopardy!’?” 

they say. “Did you win?”

“Nope,” I say.
Then I smile and change the 

subject.
