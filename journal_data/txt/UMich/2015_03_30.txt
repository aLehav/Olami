Make Michigan 

wins CSG executive 

seats by closest 

margin in a decade

By EMILIE PLESSET

Daily News Editor

According to unofficial results 

released Friday evening, Make 
Michigan’s Cooper Charlton, an 
LSA junior, and Steven Halperin, 
an LSA sophomore, narrowly 
secured the Central Student Gov-
ernment presidential and vice 
presidential seats by five votes, 
making this year’s race the clos-
est student government election 
in the past decade.

Prior to this year’s election, 

the 2012 presidential and vice 
presidential elections had been 
the closest victory, according to 
election returns data from 2004 
to 2015. In 2012, independent 
candidates Manish Parikh and 
Omar Hashwi beat youMICH’s 
Shreya Singh and Ethan Hahn by 
146 votes.

This is also the first year that 

both major parties received more 
than 4,000 votes each, though 
Make Michigan came close last 
year when it secured the top two 
executive seats with 3,937 votes. 
In that year, Make Michigan beat 
forUM by 1,087 votes. During the

The results are in, and Make 

Michigan has done it again.

LSA junior Cooper Charlton 

and LSA sophomore Steven Hal-
perin will be the Central Student 
Government president and vice 
president, respectively, accord-
ing to unofficial election results 
released early Saturday morning.

The vote tallies were released 

24 hours after polls closed for 
the CSG elections. Charlton and 
Halperin won with 4,041 votes, 
beating The Team’s presidential 
and vice presidential competitors, 
LSA junior Will Royster and LSA 
sophomore Matt Fidel, by five 
votes.

Charlton is the current presi-

dent of the University’s Student-
Athlete Advisory Committee and 
Halperin currently serves as an 
LSA representative. This is the 
second year the Make Michigan 
party has secured the two CSG 
executive positions.

Litigation against both parties 

is still pending. Make Michigan 
has filed a suit against The Team 

CAMPUS LIFE

Diag gathering, 
keynote lecture 
celebrate legacy of 
the first teach-in 

By LINDSEY SCULLEN

Daily Staff Reporter

In the spirit of Vietnam War 

teach-in protests on campus 50 
years ago, University students, 
speakers, local community mem-
bers and parents of students encir-
cled the Block ‘M’ on the Diag on 
Friday afternoon to rally for better 
treatment of the environment and 
divestment from fossil fuels, and to 
continue campus dialogue on the 
issue.

Later in the day, participants 

gathered in an Angell Hall Audito-
rium — the same location in which 
the first Vietnam War teach-in was 
held in 1965 — to listen to investiga-
tive reporter Amy Goodman.

Both events were part of “Teach-

in + 50: End the War Against the 
Planet,” a two-day-long demon-
stration focused on giving climate 

change the political and social 
attention necessary to counteract 
future consequences.

On the Diag, protesters chanted 

pro-divestment slogans, including: 
“Be the leaders and the best, from 
fossil fuels we must divest.” Some 
carried recycled cardboard signs 
with calls to action such as, “End 
This Climate War NOW!” and 
“Save our ONLY home! Divest from 
Fossil Fuels #ClimateTeachIn50.”

At one point, the participants 

also assembled to form the number 
350 in honor of 350.org’s goal to 
keep the amount of carbon diox-
ide in the atmosphere below 350 
parts-per-million. Many scientists 
say this decrease in carbon dioxide 
levels is necessary to maintain a 
habitable planet.

Goodman — host and producer 

of independent public news pro-
gram, “Democracy Now!” — gave 
the keynote address. She is a 
renowned investigative reporter 
who has covered the East Timor 
independence movement and the 
impact of oil rigs in Nigeria. She 
was detained outside of the 2008 
Republican National Convention

fellow performers during the Vagina Monologues at the Trotter Multicultural Center on Friday.

Students perform 

acclaimed play 
on feminism, 

sexuality

By SAMIHA MATIN

Daily Staff Reporter

The annual production of 

“The 
Vagina 
Monologues” 

returned to campus Thursday 
and Friday to explore feminism 

and female sexuality.

Held in Rackham Auditorium 

on Thursday and at the Trotter 
Multicultural Center on Fri-
day, the University’s chapter of 
Students for Choice put on the 
critically acclaimed show for 
the third time. Sponsored by 
LSA Student Government, Cen-
tral Student Government and 
Student Life, the event featured 
18 performances by University 
students.

Created by playwright Eve 

Ensler in 1996, “The Vagina 

Monologues” is a play based on 
interviews with real women 
talking about their experiences 
and views on their sexuality. It is 
composed of short scenes deal-
ing with an array of topics such 
as masturbation, orgasms, birth, 
sex, love and rape.

LSA junior Kayla Smith 

directed the event and said she 
made an effort to include top-
ics about diversity in the show, 
which the original monologues 
lacked.

SCIENCE

‘U’ collaboration
 uses stem cells to 
better understand 

lung disease

By SANJAY REDDY

Daily Staff Reporter

Stem cell research has long 

been seen as a new frontier for 
disease therapeutics. By coax-
ing stem cells to form 3D minia-
ture lung structures, University 
researchers are helping explain 
why.

In a collaborative study, Uni-

versity researchers devised a 
system to generate self-orga-
nizing human lung organoids, 
or artificially-grown organisms. 
These organoids are 3D models 
that can be used to better under-
stand lung diseases.

Jason Spence, the assistant 

professor of internal medicine 
and cell and developmental biol-
ogy, who was a senior author of 
the study, said one of the key 
implications of these lungs is

‘U’ faces affirmative action case

ZACH MOORE /Daily

Repper G-Eazy performs at the Block M Party at Hill 
Auditorium on Saturday. 

SHIRTLESS G - E A Z Y 

U.S. District Magistrate 

Judge 
Thomas 
Carlson 

ordered the University to 
turn over the names and 
phone 
numbers 
of 
all 

undergraduate Black and 
Hispanic students as part 
of numerous lawsuits chal-
lenging the use of race as 
a factor in admissions to 
LSA.

In 
1997, 
two 
white 

applicants 
represented 

by the Washington D.C.-
based Center for Individ-
ual Rights filed lawsuits 
against 
the 
University, 

claiming they were denied 
admission to LSA while 
less-qualified minority stu-
dents were accepted. Later 

that year, a similar claim 
against the Law School was 
filed.

The cases were Gratz v. 

Bollinger and Grutter v. 
Bollinger, respectively. The 
cases ultimately made their 
way to the U.S. Supreme 
Court, where the justices 
upheld 
the 
University’s 

narrow use of affirmative 
action in Grutter vs. Bol-
linger, but struck down 
LSA’s point system at issue 
in Gratz v. Bollinger. Affir-
mative action was ultimate-
ly outlawed in Michigan 
after voters passed Propos-
al 2 in 2006.

In response to the 1997 

suits, interveners — which 

are 
third 
parties 
that 

state claims in an exist-
ing lawsuit — alleged that 
minority students were dis-
criminated against in the 
admissions process while 
the University gave unfair 
advantages to white subur-
ban high schools.

Subsequently, 
Godfrey 

Dillard, lead counsel for 
the intervening undergrad-
uate defendants, said he 
would use the now-avail-
able contact list to speak 
with 
minority 
students 

firsthand and gauge their 
impression of the admis-
sions process.

Event intends to 

provide an inclusive 
space for students

By SAMIHA MATIN

Daily Staff Reporter

Students gathered at the Uni-

versity’s Indoor Track and Field 
Building on Saturday to raise 
financial aid funds by dancing the 
night away.

The 
University-wide 
dance 

party, called INFINITY, was 
designed to promote an inclusive 
place for students to congregate.

An offshoot of #BBUM, a Twit-

ter campaign launched in 2013 
by the University’s Black Student 
Union, INFINITY aimed to use 
ticket sales and donations to pro-
vide scholarships and financial 
aid to students in need. The event 
was co-sponsored by the Dean of 
Students Office, School of Social 
Work, Department of Afroameri-
can and African Studies, The Black 

Student Union, Engineering Stu-
dent Government, Hillel, optiMize 
and Big Ticket Productions.

The event also served as an after 

party for the Block ‘M’ Party, a 
concert held earlier in the evening 
at Hill Auditorium.

University alum Tyrell Col-

lier, event organizer and a for-
mer speaker of the Black Student 
Union, said the movement is meant 
to create a space where minority 
students can share their experi-
ences with a wider audience.

“We challenge ourselves to 

think creatively about how we, as 
a student community, can contrib-
ute to increasing minority enroll-
ment while also building a better 
and more inclusive University 
community,” he said.

Collier said the funds will make 

it easier for underrepresented stu-
dents to enroll at the University, 
and in turn help bolster the Uni-
versity’s Black student enrollment 
rate, which has hovered around 
4 percent. As part of a list of 
demands provided to the Univer-

sity in 2014, the BSU has called on 
the University to achieve 10 per-
cent Black enrollment.

Kinesiology junior Capri’Nara 

Kendall, BSU secretary, planned 
the event. She said not all #BBUM 
events raise revenue solely intend-
ed to benefit Black students.

“We want students from all 

walks of life, religion and race to 
collaborate and learn from each 
other,” Kendall said. “We want to 
generate revenue for all students, 
not just Black students.”

The event featured two DJs — a 

University alum as well as a stu-
dent in the School of Music, The-
ater and Dance. LSA senior Arnold 
Reed, the BSU speaker, shared his 
enthusiasm about enjoying the 
dance event as well as contributing 
to a great cause.

“It’s very important for the Uni-

versity community to understand 
how much diversity can affect a 
student’s life,” Reed said. “INFIN-
ITY is a great event to raise money 
while having a good time with 
your friends.”

Though the event involves rais-

ing money intended for under-
represented students, LSA senior 
Darrartu Ali, an event organizer, 
noted that INFINITY does not 
directly challenge the problem of 
low enrollment of minority stu-
dents at the University. Rather, he 
said, it is designed to create a fun 
and inclusive environment for all 
students to help others in need.

“INFINITY should not be seen 

as the outcome of everything 
we hope to accomplish under 
#BBUM,” Ali said. “Instead, it is 
annexed to #BBUM as we wait for 
the University to implement policy 
that actually works.”

The organizers said they hope 

this event will begin to take place 
annually during Welcome Week to 
attract more students.

“We need to create spaces for 

Black students, and students of 
color more broadly, to socialize 
and have fun,” Collier said. “The 
lack of available safe spaces on 
campus for Black students to flour-
ish socially has negatively affected 
the perception and reality of Black 
student life at Michigan.”

University-wide dance party 
raises money for financial aid

Mr. Michigan competition 
fundraises for child health

FIMRC attracts 

increased number of 
students for annual 

charity event 

By EMILY MIILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

In the annual Mr. Michigan 

contest 
Sunday, 
eight 

contestants walked a red carpet 
in the Michigan Union and 
showed off a variety of talents — 
from playing instruments to lip 
syncing to cooking.

LSA senior Mario Cale, a 

member of the Pre-Medical 
Club, won the pageant, which 
is 
produced 
annually 
as 
a 

fundraiser by the University’s 
chapter of the Foundation for 
International Medical Relief of 
Children.

FIMRC is a national nonprofit 

organization 
that 
works 
to 

improve health in developing 
nations worldwide, particularly 
in the fields of child and 
maternal health.

LSA senior Elizabeth Bruno, 

FIMRC 
president, 
said 
the 

organization 
most 
recently 

collaborated 
with 
Michigan 

Health Engineered for All Lives 
to fund and build a gynecological 
examination table for a FIMRC 
clinic in Nicaragua.

This year, the money raised by 

the Mr. Michigan contest will go 
toward building latrines in the 
Dominican Republic to improve 
sanitary conditions.

“It’s definitely helping those 

areas by bringing the latrines, 
which have a zinc top that’s going 
to keep up through the rainy 
season,” Bruno said. “That’s just 
one of the ways that not only our 
chapter but FIMRC in general 
works with communities to 
spread knowledge about those 
kinds of things.”

LSA sophomore Jason Millen, 

FIMRC fundraising co-chair, 
was one of the main coordinators 
of the event. He said this year’s 
event had the biggest turnout in 
recent memory.

“Last year we only sold 

about 80 tickets, which isn’t 
bad,” Millen said. “But we’re 
expecting over a hundred this 
year.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Sheema 

Rehman, FIMRC treasurer, said 

the heightened attendance was 
due 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
participating 

student organizations. Seven 
organizations, 
in 
particular, 

collaborated with FIMRC: Circle 
K, Red Cross, Phi Delta Epsilon, 
Alpha Phi Omega, Seventh Mile 
Music, Pre-Medical Club and 
MRelay.

“It’s the diversity of the 

groups that we got,” Rehman 
said. “Normally we target the 
pre-med and pre-health clubs on 
campus, but this year we were 
able to get MRelay and Seventh 
Mile Music and these are some 
awesome additions to have.”

Bruno said the organization 

tries to revamp its event every 
year by adding new elements 
— this year, they auctioned off 
gift baskets donated by local 
businesses.

“The way that we’re doing the 

baskets is completely new, as well 
as the setup and everything,” 
Bruno said. “They’re fresh ideas 
in this fundraiser that we know 
works really well.”

Overall, 
Rehman 
said, 

Mr. 
Michigan 
is 
a 
fun 

way 
to 
fundraise 
through 

entertainment and collaboration 
with others.

LSA junior Noah Newman, member of PhiDE, lip-syncs in the talent portion of Mr. Michigan in the Michigan Union on Sunday. 


the controlled environment they 
offer for future research.

“These mini lungs will allow 

us to study diseases in a con-
trolled 
environment 
and 
to 

develop and test new drugs,” he 
said.

Specifically, Spence said, sci-

entists will be able to take skin 
samples from patients with a 
particular form of a lung dis-
ease, reprogram the cells into 
stem cells and then generate 
lung tissue for further study. He 
said by analyzing the disease 

in a controlled environment, 
researchers can gain insight 
into the progression of various 
diseases and then tailor drugs 
for treatment.

Rackham student Briana Dye 

was also a lead author of the 
study. She said the team manip-
ulated numerous signaling path-
ways involved with cell growth 
and organ formation to make 
the miniature lungs.

First, Dye said the scientists 

used proteins called growth fac-
tors to differentiate embryonic 
stem cells into endoderm, the 
germ layer that gives rise to the 
lungs.

Different growth factors were 

then used to cause the endo-
derm to become lung tissue.

“We add specific growth fac-

tors, proteins that turn on path-
ways in the cells, that will then 
cause them to lift off the mono-
layer so that we have this 3D 
spherical tissue,” she said.

Previous research has used 

stem cells in a similar manner 
to generate brain, intestine, 
stomach and liver tissue. Dye 
said one of the advantages of 
stem cell research is its direct 
path to studying human tis-
sue.

“We 
have 
worked 
with 

many animal models in the 
past,” Dye said. “Animal mod-

els present obstacles because 
they don’t exactly behave the 
way human tissue and cells do. 
This is why stem cells are so 
promising.”

In the future, Spence said 

researchers hope to use stem 
cells to replace diseased lung 
tissue and generate new lungs. 
Though he said the future is 
promising, he stressed patience 
with the process.

“In terms of tissue replace-

ment and regenerating new 
lungs for regenerative medicine, 
that’s a much more ambitious 
goal way down the road, we are 
still far away from that.”

“Recently, the Vagina Mono-

logues has fallen under criticism 
for its lack of diversity,” Smith 
said. “Our cast and crew acknowl-
edge these criticisms and think 
that dialogues surrounding issues 
of intersectionality are produc-
tive and important to have.”

Intersectionality refers to the 

intersections of identities such as 
race and gender.

In keeping with the original 

format of “The Vagina Mono-
logues,” students took turns 
performing their versions of pop-
ular monologues, including “My 
Angry Vagina,” “My Vagina was 
My Village,” “Reclaiming Cunt” 
and “My Revolution Begins in 
the Body.” Students also per-
formed “They Beat the Girl Out 
of My Boy,” a new monologue 
that explores the identities and 
difficulties of transgender life.

LSA senior Wendy Cortes per-

formed the role of a sex worker 
in the monologue “The Woman 
Who Loved to Make Vaginas 
Happy.” Cortes said she was 
thrilled to be part of an event that 
opened discussions on a stigma-
tized subject.

“I hope everyone’s awareness 

changes and that they can under-
stand issues impacting women’s 
sexuality and identities,” she 
said. “People should realize that 
despite everything, women are 
still powerful and independent.”

Business 
sophomore 
Edith 

Zhang performed the monologue 
“My Vagina Was My Village,” 
which focuses on the experienc-
es of Bosnian women subjected 
to rape. Zhang said the mono-
logues provide a powerful voice 
to all women.

“Some of the monologues are 

very comedic, such as ‘My Angry 
Vagina,’ but others bring out 
compelling issues,” she said. “As 
a society, we definitely need to be 
more aware of them.”

LSA junior Jayla Johnson, 

another performer in the show, 
said she believes the event is a 
great way to introduce these top-
ics to students in a more intimate 
setting.

“It’s a taboo topic but events 

like these bring awareness to the 
student population, especially 
since it includes students from all 
kinds of backgrounds,” she said.

LSA junior Rhani Franklin, 

the show’s producer, said she 
hoped the event will continue at 
the University, in part because 
90 percent of the show’s pro-
ceeds go to the SafeHouse Cen-
ter. The center provides services 
to women experiencing domes-
tic violence and sexual assault 
in Washtenaw County. The 
other 10 percent supports the 
V-Day campaign, which aims to 
end violence against girls and 
women.

“Through our events at the 

University, we are certainly con-
tributing for a greater cause,” she 
said.

for attempting to report on an 
anti-war protest outside.

In 
her 
speech, 
Goodman 

stressed the role of independent 
media in bringing social justice 
and peace. She said the personal 
narratives investigated by inde-
pendent outlets can allow audi-
ences to break down stereotypes 
and caricatures that lead to mis-
understanding and hate.

“I think the media can be 

the greatest force for peace on 
Earth,” Goodman said. “Instead, 
all too often, from the Vietnam 
War, to Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen 
and Syria today, it is wielded as a 
weapon of war. And that has to be 
challenged.”

She described the challenges 

reporters met in Vietnam in the 
1960s, including how corporate 
media agencies such as ABC, NBC 
and CBS would not run their sto-
ries. For this reason, she said, 
independent media is important 
for telling the stories that are 
sometimes too controversial for 
corporately run outlets.

“We need a media that covers 

power, not covers for power,” she 
said. “We need media that covers 
movements that create history 
and make static.”

LSA junior Nicholas Jansen — 

the president of Divest and Invest, 
a student organization that pro-
motes sustainability — led chants 
on the Diag and stressed the 
necessity of divestment to fellow 
protesters. He echoed Goodman’s 
call for movements that challenge 
the political landscape.

Divest and Invest has repeat-

edly called for the University to 
divest from fossil fuel compa-
nies. Recently, Central Student 
Government passed a resolution 
in conjunction with Divest and 
Invest which asks the University’s 
Board of Regents to form a com-
mittee to investigate the propri-
ety the University’s oil and coal 
investments.

Jansen said the University’s 

Vietnam teach-in 50 years ago was 
responsible for a domino effect of 
activism that ultimately encour-
aged the United States to pull sol-
diers out of Vietnam and end the 
war, adding that this example was 
what inspired Sunday’s event.

“Now that’s what we hope to do 

with this: start something here, 
start something big,” Jansen said. 
“Create some noise that make 
institutions like the University 
of Michigan — that have a lot of 
power and influence on what this 
country does — say we’re not put-
ting up with this anymore, we’re 
done with fossil fuels.”

M. Jahi Chappell, the director 

of agroecology and agriculture 
policy at the Institute for Agricul-
ture and Trade Policy, was among 
many speakers at Friday’s teach-
in who spoke prior to Goodman’s 
keynote address. He said the issue 
of global climate change “is even 
bigger than the Vietnam War.”

Chappell added that, because 

climate change happens in “slow 
motion,” it can be difficult to 
impress upon people the reality 
of its severity. Oftentimes, he said, 
economic barriers are what stop 
people from acting on climate 
change issues.

“But there’s a really good 

recent presentation arguing we 
could see 30-percent unemploy-
ment 80 years from now because 
of the amount of damage from 
climate change,” he said, referenc-
ing a Tufts University study called 
“Macroeconomics in the Age of 
Climate Change.”

“This is slow motion, but that 

is a real possibility. We could see 
huge unemployment in the future, 
not to mention lots of other bad 
effects and lives lost,” Chappell 
said. “So this is to try and reenact 
energy from the Vietnam era, on 
something that’s even bigger than 
that.”

Chants continued intermittent-

ly throughout the rally. A common 
one was “Hey, Obama. Stop this 
climate drama.”

Tom Hayden, author of the Port 

Huron Statement of the Students 
for a Democratic Society and a 
former editor of The Michigan 
Daily, gave the rally’s final speech 
prior to the formal teach-in in 
Angell Hall. He spoke about clean 
energy sources that the University 
and the rest of society have yet to 
use. Citing wind and solar power 
successes in other countries, he 
questioned why the University 
has not made similar strides.

“The Great Lakes should be 

the source of wind power for the 
whole region,” he said.

He further referenced the Uni-

versity’s potential in this area, 
given the esteemed College of 

Engineering and its students. 
He acknowledged the signifi-
cant strides already being made 
by engineers at the University, 
though he believes more could be 
done.

After Hayden’s speech, teach-

in participants filed into Angell 
Hall to listen to Goodman’s key-
note address.

Engineering freshman Trevor 

Hoffman said he attended the 
teach-in because people need to 
understand the reality of climate 
change science and future conse-
quences.

“Why am I here? To save the 

planet,” he said. “If we don’t edu-
cate the masses and get them all 
to know, then we’re not going to 
move forward and we’re not going 
to make any progress. We just have 
to keep moving, we have to edu-
cate more people, get more people 
to know, spread the word, make it 
known, get everyone to know.”

Marie Lynn Miranda, dean of 

the School of Natural Resources 
and Environment, gave the wel-
coming address prior to Good-
man’s presentation.

Miranda said events like the 

teach-in are important for inspir-
ing others to promote change 
through dispersing knowledge.

“I always say challenging times 

are also times of opportunity,” 
Miranda said.

During her speech, Goodman 

used her experience in Selma, 
Alabama on March 7, where she 
went to commemorate the 50-year 
anniversary of Bloody Sunday, to 
emphasize that it is not enough to 
simply remember the past — citi-
zens must use knowledge to make 
social progress.

“I think we are seeing little 

uprisings and larger ones around 
the country that indicate some-
thing is afoot,” she said. “The 
media doesn’t cover movements, 
the media covers politicians, those 
who cheerlead for war.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Valeriya 

Epshteyn, outreach chair for 
Divest and Invest, felt Goodman’s 
speech spoke devoted attention to 
voices that usually do not receive 
recognition from other media out-
lets.

“Amy Goodman’s speech was 

one of the most honest things I’ve 
heard in a long time on campus,” 
Epshteyn said. “It didn’t feel very 
censored, and that’s what she said 
about the independent voice.”

and LSA senior Andrew Loeb 
for harvesting 534 e-mails; The 
Team filed a similar suit against 
Make Michigan for harvesting 
5,719 e-mails; and Make Michigan 
filed a suit against LSA junior Will 
Royster, The Team’s presidential 
candidate, for influencing a stu-
dent while voting.

E-mail violations are assessed 

per e-mail recipient. Candidates 
are not allowed to solicit votes 
through listservs they don’t own, 
for example. Candidates or cam-
paign volunteers are also not 
allowed to harvest student e-mail 
addresses for campaign purposes, 
according to the CSG Compiled 
Code.

“We’re going to fight them on 

whatever we have,” LSA junior 
Jacob Abudaram, The Team’s 
campaign manager, said Saturday 
morning. “Win or lose, we’re still 
here.”

According to Law student 

Paige Becker, the University’s 
elections director, if both parties 
are found guilty of harvesting 
emails, their entire slates could be 
disqualified. In this scenario, the 
Defend Affirmative Action Party 
would take office. DAAP’s execu-
tive slate amassed 742.05 votes — 
over 3,000 votes less than either 
Make Michigan or The Team.

“It would be all of the next 

highest vote getters that are actu-
al students,” Becker said in an 
interview Sunday. “So for exam-
ple, the DAAP ticket would take 
over the presidential and vice 
presidential seat, and every-
where where there were DAAP 
candidates for the assembly or 
independent candidates for the 
assembly they would take over 
the seats. Any that weren’t 
filled were be filled in the fall.”

The election results came 

in after Make Michigan filed 
complaints against The Team 
for destroying campaign mate-
rials. The party alleged that 
members of The Team erased 
a Make Michigan chalk adver-
tisement on the Diag and 
replaced it with an advertise-
ment reading “Vote for the 
Team.” The University Elec-
tions 
Committee 
ultimately 

found The Team guilty of the 
charges in a two-to-one vote 

and assessed them four demer-
its. Demerits do not affect 
a party unless it receives 10 
demerits, which then disquali-
fies the candidates.

Make Michigan also filed a 

complaint against The Team 
for campaign finance disclo-
sure violations. However, The 
Team filed a counterclaim 
against Make Michigan for fil-
ing a frivolous complaint. Both 
parties were found not guilty 
Saturday night, yielding no 
demerits on either side.

The Make Michigan plat-

form addresses several issues 
regarding campus safety and 
diversity. The party’s platform 
outlines goals to improve cam-
pus safety by working with the 
city of Ann Arbor to improve 
off-campus lighting as well 
as launch a new safety mobile 
application.

The party also intends to 

promote an inclusive cam-
pus environment through the 
implementation of SEED facul-
ty training, a for-profit faculty 
education program.

During CSG debates ear-

lier 
this 
month, 
Charlton 

addressed the party’s commit-
ment to improving diversity 
and inclusion on campus.

“Diversity is more than skin 

deep,” Charlton said. “The Uni-
versity of Michigan is where 
great minds come. With Make 
Michigan, we are going to be 
able to make the difference.”

The release of the results 

coincided with the deadline for 
filing litigation. According to 
Law student John Lin, CSG’s 
student general counsel, this 
change was implemented in 
spring 2014 to expedite the liti-
gation process.

The former election policy 

stated that results would be 
announced after litigation was 
resolved. Under the previous 
policy, the announcement of 
last year’s CSG election results 
was delayed until five days 
after polls closed.

“The intent behind this rule 

change is that, say if you won, 
you can drop all the claims you 
filed against the other party 
and that would reduce litigation 
a little bit,” Lin said.

Daily News Editor Michael 

Sugerman contributed reporting.

ELECTION
From Page 1A

last decade, the average differ-
ence in votes between the win-
ning and second place ticket was 
793.9 votes. Excluding this year’s 
margin, the average is 872.8 votes.

According to Law student 

John Lin, CSG’s student general 
counsel, including write-in can-
didates, about 22 percent of the 
student body voted in this year’s 
presidential election, a roughly 2 
percent increase over last year’s 
student body voter turnout.

He said while this year’s elec-

tion saw one of the highest voter 
turnouts, the 2013 presidential 
election saw the highest voter 
turnout, with about 24 percent 
of the student body voting in the 
election.

Lin said the higher voter turn-

out could be attributed to the par-
ties’ intensified campaign tactics 
and efforts to reach out to many 
communities on campus. He 
also said having multiple parties 
contending for positions usually 
increases voter turnout, citing 
the 2013 election which saw stu-
dents voting for four major par-
ties, including forUM, youMICH, 
momentUM and an independent 
ticket.

Though 
Make 
Michigan 

received the most votes in this 
year’s election, Law student Paige 
Becker, the University’s elections 
director, said due to pending 
litigation against the party, the 
election results could flip in The 
Team’s favor.

The University Elections Com-

mittee is still ruling on five com-
plaints, including three against 
The Team for harvesting e-mails 
and influencing voters while vot-
ing, and another against Make 
Michigan for violating e-mail 
regulations, which are assessed 
on a per e-mail recipient basis.

Becker said Make Michigan 

was accused of harvesting 5,719 
e-mail addresses. If the party 
were found guilty of violating 
the CSG Compiled Code under 
this allegation, they would gar-
ner enough demerits to disqualify 
their party.

The next hearing will be Mon-

day night. Then the UEC will 
have 36 hours to release an opin-
ion, at which point the parties 
have an additional 24 hours to file 
an appeal to the Central Student 
Judiciary. Lin said assuming no 
complaints are dropped, election 
results will not be certified until 
Thursday morning at the earliest.

If Make Michigan is disquali-

fied, this would not be the first 
time a winning party is unable to 
take office after being found to 
have violated election regulations.

In 2013 forUM’s Chris Osborn 

and Hayley Sakwa garnered 3,413 
votes in the presidential and vice 
presidential elections, beating 
youMICH by 485 votes. How-
ever, the UEC later ruled that 
Osborn had influenced voters, 
thereby disqualifying the forUM 
executive ticket and allowing 
youMICH’s Michael Proppe, a 
current Business graduate stu-
dent, and Bobby Dishell, current 
CSG president and Public Policy 
senior, to take office.

L

ife, at times, is completely 
overwhelming, 
especially 

during the years defined 

by 
undergradu-

ate education. It’s 
not 
necessarily 

the busywork, but 
rather to what it’s 
made to amount: 
this idea that the 
purpose of educa-
tion is to enable 
you to navigate 
the thralls of the 
real 
world, 
to 

secure a job that 
pays well, to start saving for retire-
ment, etc. It’s the pressure to real-
ize predefined notions of success 
that catalyze anxiety.

This anxiety is what has come 

to define higher education in the 
United States.

The expectations I place on myself 

are ever-changing, multifaceted and 
confusing as a result. The amount 
of pressure I feel at any given time 
usually ranges from nominal to near 
implosion on my internal barometer. 
I often wonder if the University, 
American culture in general or my 
waxing and waning apathy to formal 
education is to blame.

The trouble with this inter-

play can be summed up by an 
 

overarching analogy.

The University is akin to a drug 

dealer. The high is so intense 
and euphoric from just a first 
sample of his product that you’re 
 

instantly hooked.

When an 18-year-old opens that 

acceptance letter into the exclusive 
club of “Leaders and Best,” the ini-
tial feeling is the inevitable high of 
being deemed special. It’s the start 
of an indoctrination of arrogance; 
an education of privilege instead 
of right. A fast track to the apex of 
achievement. Once on campus, it’s 
all the freshmen can do to chase 
after that elusive feeling of signifi-
cance. He or she follows a formula of 
success outlined by the University, 
searches for every possible affirma-
tion and engages in competition with 
themselves and others in order to be 
deemed the best.

The dealer peddles us what we 

think we need. We use despite the 
incurred monetary and mental cost. 
Thousands are spent in search of 
that which was felt when that letter 
was first opened. This quest stomps 
out creativity, produces paranoia, 
self-loathing and depression.

If the University is the dealer, 

American culture is the supplier. It is 
the creator of the drug while being, 
at the same time, the entity that 
fosters the dealer’s wealth. Culture 
creates a market within which the 
dealer’s product will be valued; our 
socialization leads us to believe that 
consumption of the drug — partak-
ing in this perverted form of higher 
education — regardless of the side 
effects, leads to greatness.

Think of Aldous Huxley’s “Brave 

New World.” Those occupying the 
highest echelons of society — the 
Alphas and Betas, those who have 
been indoctrinated to the hyper-con-
sumerist values of the ever-peace-
able World State since conception 
— are encouraged by the State to 
engage recreationally and religiously 
to the point of dependence in the use 
of the drug soma, which has halluci-
nogenic qualities that transport the 
user into a state of blind optimism.

Similarly, 
American 
society 

makes available its form of higher 
education to the masses under the 
same guise of happiness through 
material success. It pushes us to con-
form, to fit the mold of a university 
student. It ignites within us the need 
surpass our peers and justifies the 
equation of monetary gain with per-
sonal satisfaction. Rest and mental 
health aren’t options and being over-
worked to the point of needing per-
formance enhancers is considered 
the norm. Production and further 
proliferation of this ideology are key 
to the supplier’s success; we engage 
with the system because it’s viewed 
as the only viable life option.

Finally, all analogous factors con-

sidered, the student plays the role of 
the addict, the one who ultimately 
becomes dependent on both dealer 
and supplier. Once that first bump 
has been had, it’s hard to imagine a 
world without. The fear of running 
out governs all action. No matter the 
detrimental costs, the addict contin-

ues to subsist within preset confines.

University students often choose 

the most lucrative educational path. 
Thinking deeply about problems 
plays second fiddle to vocational 
politics. There’s a lack of critique 
on the system because students are 
hard-pressed to conceptualize an 
education not defined by resume-
building summer internships and a 
promenade before potential employ-
ers at job fairs. We have become 
addicted to high marks and affirma-
tions, to the prospect of the yearly 
bonus and the company car. It 
seems as if there’s no longer a belief 
of higher education as a means for 
 

individual growth.

We don’t study to learn; we study 

to succeed.

And if success doesn’t come, the 

student is left jaded and broke, an 
addict without a fix, profiteered by a 
dealer and supplier whose only focus 
was a continued influx of money. The 
withdrawal — the understanding of 
how the system truly functioned — is 
bitterly painful.

The saddest part is that victim and 

perpetrator are one and the same.

As students, we have a choice. We 

can demand to be nourished by our 
bodies of higher education, rather 
than to be influenced by them. We 
can accustom ourselves to challenge 
our socialization, to redefine what 
it means to be educated. We can 
democratize the process by afford-
ing education to all individuals 
who value knowledge as a tool with 
which to overturn systems of subju-
gation, including those to which we 
pay increasingly expensive tuition. 
Getting sober is an onerous, confus-
ing task, but one necessary for indi-
vidual and societal health; to remain 
under the influence is to feed the 
drug to the next generation.

Perhaps that’s why, at the end 

of my undergraduate career, I find 
myself at odds with the true value of 
my education. I ask myself: have the 
last four years of my life amounted 
to a process of self-realization, or 
rather, to an appeasement of the 
status quo?

The dealer, the supplier and the addict

AUSTIN
DAVIS

As students at the University of 

Michigan, we’re commonly united 
through phrases like “Go Blue” and 
take pride in being the, “Leaders 
and Best.” Our strong sense of com-
munity is part of the reason why 
so many students choose to attend 
 

the University.

This past week, a resolution was 

introduced to Central Student Gov-
ernment that hurts this sense of com-
munity and unity that many hold 
valuable to their Michigan experi-
ence. Students Allied for Freedom 
and Equality has introduced “A Reso-
lution to Call Upon The University of 
Michigan to Appoint a Committee to 
Investigate Investments in Socially 
Irresponsible Companies that Vio-
late Palestinian Human Rights.” As 
a representative on the CSG Assem-
bly, it concerns me that a resolution 
that was so divisive last year has 
resurfaced. This is a resolution that 
I cannot support and that my fellow 
Wolverines should not support.

There’s no denying that the Israe-

li-Palestinian conflict is a triggering, 
tough and difficult issue to discuss. 
There’s also no denying this resolu-
tion is attempting to turn this histori-
cal conflict into one where students 
conflate the Boycott, Divest and 
Sanctions movement with all social 
justice efforts. This leads to a frac-
tured campus community in which 
students are only pushed to further 
extremes on the spectrum of the 
conflict. While every student on this 
campus has the fundamental right 
to have their voice heard, I cannot 
support movements such as BDS and 
#UMDivest, which present a one-sid-
ed narrative and do not allow for col-
laborative or constructive dialogue.

Divestment has historically been 

used at our University with regard to 
South African apartheid, the tobac-
co industry and, most recently, the 
oil and coal industries. In 2005, the 
University’s CFO provided the basic 
outline for determining whether 
or not divestment is appropriate. 
This framework should be followed 
when asking the University’s Board 
of Regents to divest the University’s 
endowment, which is not made of 
student tuition, from a socially irre-
sponsible set of investments. I chal-

lenge the appropriateness of SAFE’s 
request through this process laid out 
by the University CFO.

The statement from the CFO reads: 

“We will ask the Regents to appoint 
an ad hoc committee to investigate 
the ethical and moral implications of 
our investments only when the fol-
lowing conditions have been met:

• The concern to be explored must 

express the broadly and consistently 
held position of the campus commu-
nity over time.

• There must be reason to believe 

that the behavior or action in ques-
tion may be antithetical to the core 
mission and values of the University.

• There must be reason to believe 

that the organization, industry 
or entity to be singled out may 
be uniquely responsible for the 
 

problems identified.”

Regarding the first point of this 

statement, there’s clearly no broadly 
and consistently expressed position 
of the campus community regarding 
divestment on this issue. Last year, 
when SAFE introduced a similar res-
olution, hundreds of students with 
a wide range of opinions attended 
CSG’s meetings and spoke during the 
community concerns portion of the 
meeting in an attempt to persuade 
Assembly members to vote one way 
or another.

When looking at the second state-

ment, take into account one of the 
University’s core missions — the 
pursuit and dissemination of truth 
and knowledge. Passing a resolu-
tion as controversial as the one pro-
posed would steer the University in 
the opposite direction. Rather than 
opening the door for dialogue in 
which people can learn, BDS is dis-
suading individuals from being able 
to express and form new opinions 
at the University. Voting yes for this 
resolution sends a dangerous signal 
internally — to the members of our 
own campus community, and exter-
nally, to our peer institutions along 
with local and national lawmakers 
— that decisions can be made with 
limited information and the suppres-
sion of a wide range of opinions and 
knowledge.

Finally, the third prong deals with 

responsibility for the identified prob-

lems. While the companies targeted 
in this resolution have been identified 
by BDS as infringing upon the human 
rights of Palestinians, this resolution 
fails to shed light on the positive work 
that these companies perform to help 
those in the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip such as building homes, hospitals 
and schools. Claiming that these four 
companies are uniquely responsible 
for issues in the Middle East is a base-
less accusation being treated as fact.

While BDS is a movement that is 

attempting to hurt a country thou-
sands of miles away, in reality, it’s 
only hurting our campus community 
right here at home. SAFE has cre-
ated an atmosphere in which only 
one narrative is given legitimacy, 
and where dissent, discussion or dia-
logue is silenced. This threatens the 
ability of members of our campus to 
operate as an open and intellectual 
community. Last year, SAFE held 
events such as a depiction of a West 
Bank checkpoint and delivered hun-
dreds of dorm residents “mock evic-
tion notices” that suggested they had 
been evicted from their dorms. These 
actions show that this student group 
aims to educate community members 
through fear and intimidation rather 
than through information and fact. 
SAFE is a student organization on 
our campus that’s actively creating a 
polarized campus atmosphere.

As a CSG representative and 

member of the Jewish community, 
I cannot support a resolution that 
undermines the ability of community 
members to create a united, inclusive 
campus. I cannot support a resolution 
that places absolute blame for a com-
plicated conflict on one side. I cannot 
support a resolution that provides a 
platform for anti-Semitism to thrive. 
What the University of Michigan 
needs are solutions that bring multi-
ple parties together for constructive 
dialogue and action. We will not do 
this by annually proposing divisive 
resolutions that spark conflict.

I ask you to join me in defeating this 

resolution, but more importantly, I ask 
for your support in creating solutions 
that strengthen our community.

Why I cannot vote for divestment

FROM THE DAILY

A 

recent study released by the Institute of Medicine suggests 
that raising the minimum legal age for purchasing tobacco 
products to 21 could prevent, or at least delay, tobacco use 

and reduce the risk for later addiction in young people. The report 
states that if an increased minimum purchase age was implemented 
today, there would be a 12 percent reduction in tobacco usage by 
2100. This figure should not be ignored. Moving to increase the age 
at which individuals can legally purchase tobacco has significant 
potential benefits, but can’t be the only step taken. The government 
should consider increasing programs that aid smokers in quitting 
and potentially increase taxation on tobacco products.

According to the Surgeon General, nearly 

90 percent of adult daily smokers have their 
first cigarette by age 18 and 99 percent have 
theirs by age 26. Those most impacted by 
raising the minimum age would be teenagers 
aged 15 to 17.

If the legal minimum age to purchase 

tobacco were 21, it would limit the ability 
of high school students to obtain tobacco 
products themselves or ask siblings or 
other family members to get these products 
for them. Making tobacco products less 
accessible to younger populations will reduce 
the number of individuals who will become 
addicted to tobacco products later on in life. 
Moreover, increasing the tobacco purchasing 
age would further stigmatize the product, 
making younger individuals less likely to 
start using it.

That said, a law to raise the minimum age 

for purchasing tobacco products must be 
implemented correctly. The 18-to-21-year-
old population should be grandfathered in, 
which would avoid the issue of forcing these 
young people to try and find other ways 
of acquiring tobacco products or quit cold 
turkey. While the grandfather clause would 
not be intended to promote the continuation 
of smoking habits, it would be a way to help 
those quit under smoother and probably 
 

safer circumstances.

Additionally, there are other issues that 

raising the legal tobacco purchasing age 
does not address. According to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2011, 
68.9 percent of adult smokers wanted to 
stop smoking and 42.7 percent had made 
an attempt to quit in the past year, meaning 

they stopped smoking for at least one day in 
an attempt to quit. Clearly, raising the age 
limit is not the only solution. Improving the 
availability of resources to help people quit 
smoking is also vitally important.

Given that several studies have found 

that higher taxes on tobacco products 
would effectively reduce smoking habits, 
especially with young people and low-
income populations, it should also be highly 
considered as a solution. For example, 
a 10-percent increase in tobacco prices 
would lead to a five- to 15-percent decrease 
in smoking in people ages 18 and under. 
Since people of lower socioeconomic status 
account for a larger percentage of those who 
use tobacco products, and studies show that 
lower income people are more responsive 
to higher prices, a tax would likely have a 
significant impact on a large portion of the 
tobacco-using population.

Along with measures that must be taken 

to reduce the overall percentage of people 
who smoke, increasing the minimum legal 
tobacco purchasing age presents significant 
upsides. 
Decreasing 
the 
availability 
of 

tobacco products to youths would increase 
the stigma attached to the use of these 
products and further serve to decrease rates 
of consumption. However crucial, this is 
just the beginning of a conversation on the 
culture of tobacco use in the United States. 
Tobacco use is intricately linked with other 
factors, such as stress and socioeconomic 
status. Therefore, if we, as a society, are 
serious about eradicating tobacco use, then 
ideas to reduce poverty and improve mental 
health treatment must also be addressed.

Finding my Groove

L

ast semester, I wrote about perfor-
mance groups on campus, explor-
ing how they have incorporated 

themselves into the Univer-
sity lifestyle and what they 
have done to have a unique 
presence on campus. If you 
are in a performance group, 
you have had the great 
opportunity to bond with 
others who share the same 
desire to create a craft. For 
any of you who know me, I 
am part of a group on cam-
pus called Groove. We are 
casually known as “those 
guys that play trash cans,” but we are much 
more than that. But more than anything, 
this group has made my college experience 
 

absolutely wonderful.

I came into college a quiet, nervous percus-

sionist who felt most comfortable at the back 
of the band or hidden in the pit orchestra. Yes, 
percussion and drumming are not the typical 
instruments of an introvert, but damn were 
they fun to play. I had started when I was just 
a wee fourth-grader, so naturally I gravitated 
towards the percussion section.

Flash forward to freshman year, hearing 

Groove playing on overturned and painted 
recycling bins during Festifall. I wanted to try 
out, but I was just too chicken. I was scared 
that it would be a male-dominated group, 
much too frightening for this little freshman 
girl to dive right into. But throughout the year, 
I watched my long-time friend rock out on 
stage at his Groove shows. It was during those 
shows when I realized, “I could so play that.” 
It wasn’t anything I couldn’t do if I practiced 
enough. I thought, “how cool would it be for me 
to be in a group dedicated solely to music?!” It 
was after the first Groove show I saw that I 

vowed to myself to try out the next year. My 
life needed music, something that I had been 
doing since I was three years old. To just stop 
cold turkey when I got to college made the 
transition from home to school even more dif-
ficult. I needed to be a part of something that 
had always been a part of me.

The next year, I tried out. I got my accep-

tance e-mail. I cried. I was undeniably happy. 
To the Groovers reading this, yes, I did actually 
cry. I was chosen to be a part of a group that 
wanted me because of my talents, not for how 
I appeared. It was at that point that I started to 
become comfortable with who I was. Groove 
helped me come out of my shell and be more 
outgoing. You cannot be a shy individual and 
stand on stage in front of 1,500 people. The 
combination exists, but it is difficult to manage. 
You become uninhibited, and you learn and 
absorb the other personalities of the group. We 
are only about 30 people, but the alumni and 
dedicated fans make this a well developed net-
work that makes me love what I do.

Groove has helped me to expand my artis-

tic abilities, my music writing, to grow in 
leadership roles and be exposed to new types 
of music genres. Let’s not forget that I have 
now gone from hiding in the back of my band 
to doing a battle cry on stage in front of hun-
dreds of people, dressing like a hippie from 
Soul Train and acting as Ursula the Sea Witch, 
more excited than nervous to be out on that 
stage. I strive for showing the public what 
Groove and I have been able to accomplish in 
these past three years.

But to be honest, I am terrified to leave these 

people. Love does not even begin to describe 
how I feel toward these people with whom I 
spend countless hours, practices, chill ses-
sions, parties and heart-to-hearts. We share a 
craft building music and instruments together.

To you out there who is a part of a group on 

campus, be thankful that you are a 
member and realize what you have 
gained from such a group. If you 
are still searching for your group, 
keep looking. You will find some-
thing that makes you happy, that 

makes you want to never leave this 
University. As I prepare to depart 
from this group when I graduate in 
a few short weeks, I want to thank 
my fellow Groovers who inspired 
personal growth in my personal-

ity, my character and my capac-
ity to love a group of strange and 
 

wonderful people.

“Which one of you is Gucci Mane?”
It’s hard to get into 
offensive ‘Get Hard’

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

Though it’s not always clear 

where 
the 
line 
is 
between 

offensive 
jokes 
and 
funny, 

boundary-
pushing 
ones 

lies, 
“Get 

Hard” 
falls 

definitively 
into the former 
category, 
relying 
on 

overdone 
acting 
and 
a 

questionable plot structure to 
confront issues much larger than 
it can handle.

The film’s premise revolves 

around one rich white banker’s 
fear that he will be raped when 
he goes to prison. James (Will 
Ferrell, “Step Brothers”), a well-
off hedge fund manager who 
seems completely ignorant to 
the working class around him, is 
falsely accused of laundering funds 
from his company and is sentenced 
to 10 years in the worst prison in 
Los Angeles He employs Darnell 
(Kevin Hart, “Ride Along”), the 
owner of the car washing service 
in his office parking garage, to 
teach him how to survive in 
jail, assuming that because he 

is Black, he must know his way 
around an Los Angeles County 
maximum security prison. James 
is wrong; Darnell is a straight-
edged, hardworking father, but 
because he needs money to move 
his family out of their dangerous 
neighborhood, he decides to teach 
James about prison survival, or 
at least what he thinks prison 
might be like. The two enter into 
a month-long training program, 
and finally end up working to solve 
who set James up and clearing his 
name altogether.

While there is some small seed-

ling of a good or funny idea deep 
within this plot, “Get Hard” edges 
past satire and into the realm of 
offensive, working under the guise 
of breaking down stereotypes 
while actually relying on them for 
its entire story. The film clearly try-
ing to make some statement about 
wealth and the working class in 
America, but it relies on rape jokes 
and racist supporting characters to 
make this remark, simultaneously 
reinforcing the ideas it claims to be 
subverting.

Although Hart’s character actu-

ally has some laughable moments 
(in one scene he impressively acts 
out an altercation in the prison 
yard between three over-the-top 
black, Latino and gay inmates, 

playing three characters at once), 
Ferrell falls flat, crafting a ridicu-
lous and unbelievable character 
with little material to build on. 
While this bit succeeds in movies 
like “Anchorman” or “Step Broth-
ers,” where Ferrell’s impossibly 
strange characters are the key to 
the winning satire, his role in “Get 
Hard” seems tired and overdone.

One of the most destructive 

things that can happen to a 
comedian is that they actually 
believe themselves to be hilari-
ously funny; Ferrell has obvious-
ly fallen into this trap, with no 
one brave enough to tell him he’s 
gone too far. The film becomes 
a long string of him laughing at 
his own jokes, with Hart run-
ning around him in circles to 
weave some kind of sense into 
the story.

Although there are certainly 

a few funny moments in “Get 
Hard,” the film and its actors 
approach sensitive topics with 
a half-baked attempt to actually 
make a statement. By trying 
to take on the major issues of 
race and class but grounding its 
story in one long rape joke, “Get 
Hard” turns its message into a 
joke, and the entire film crashes 
under the weight of the issues it 
tries to confront.

The first part of this column 

was published in The Michigan 
Daily on Mar. 13.
A

nwar Kharral leers out a 
bedroom window. Right 
hand 

hovering 
over his 
crotch, a 
dusting of 
peach fuzz 
beading 
sweat across 
his upper 
lip, Anwar 
pauses 
before pos-
ing a ques-
tion of seemingly profound 
importance. “Wank? Or tell 
group? … Wank? Or tell group?” 
Masturbate at the sight of the 
woman chopping wood outside 
— a woman no one else believes 
even exists — or point, shout, 
show the world she’s not just 
a hormone-addled figment of 
his imagination? As George 
Berkeley once wondered, if a 
tree falls in a forest and no one 
is around to hear it, should 
Anwar rub one out?

This is the kind of question, 

just stupid enough to stick 
without risk of self-parody, 
that is asked a lot in “Skins,” 
the BBC TV series that secured 
Dev Patel, Jack O’Donnell and 
many 
other 
yuppie 
British 

actors their spot in Hollywood 
casting 
lineups. 
Patel, 
who 

portrayed Anwar for the show’s 
first two highly watchable if 
not groundbreaking seasons, 
approaches 
those 
questions 

with an eye on the open, 
often cringeworthy treatment 
of 
sexuality 
they 
imply, 
a 

certain candidness or, more 
accurately, bluntness that lays 
the foundation for characters 
in soon to come American 
counterparts like “Girls” and 
“Shameless.”

Like the rest of the cast, Patel 

is swinging for the fences in 
every frame, but only because 
the premise demands that kind 
of self-aware outrage at the 
faintest pin drop of a plot point. 
It’s the Hollywood version of 
“they broke up???” — a set of 
character traits as enclosed, 
petty 
and 
exaggerated 
as 

anyone who ever went to high 
school remembers them being. 
Audiences shovel through the 
empty calories, writers wheel 
through the smarmy sound 
bites, and in this sense, the 
window dressing serves its 
purpose. 
Soap 
operas 
have 

been perfecting (peddling) the 
formula for half a century, and 
make no mistake: along their 
deepest sinews, that’s exactly 
what these shows are. Punched 
up melodrama for millennials. 
There’s no need for Patel or 
any of the other actors to flex 
subtlety, so why bother?

“Skins” only ever manages 

to break the barrier and get 
under skins when it’s dealing 
with race, doing so in a way 
that’s 
both 
glancing 
yet 

poignant. It offers answers, 
sort of. In a scene where Patel 
tries 
to 
stammer 
through 

the reasons behind Anwar’s 
homophobia, 
the 
dialogue 

settles the argument with a 
four-word 
explanation. 
“I’m 

just a Muslim.” The instinctive 
response 
is 
“there’s 
more.” 

Much more, but the show’s 
effectiveness 
in 
discussing 

these issues stems from a 
willingness to nick the jugular, 
then leave whoever’s in front of 
the camera to stanch the blood 
with their hands.

The writing never changes 

after that crucial scene, but 
Patel’s performance takes a 
shot of liquefied cocaine to 
the face. In an introductory 
screenwriting class, it could be 

compared to finding oneself lost 
at sea in a gale of subtext, only 
an actor keeping the dialogue 
from its insistence on dog-
paddling away from a shitstorm. 
So even though Anwar never 
even deigns to look over his 
shoulder while hiding behind 
those feeble four words, Patel is 
hand-delivered a role dripping 
with moldable tension. And 
the result is more human, real, 
uncontrived than anything he’s 
done since.

Watching “The Best Exotic 

Marigold Hotel” is like being 
stabbed in the part of the 
brain that parcels out feelings 
of national pride to the rest 
of the body. There’s no pain 
— it just coughs a little before 
keeling over somewhere in 
the broken pauses between 
Dev Patel’s (playing Sonny 
Kapoor) put-on Indian accent. 
Of course, let’s not forget the 
fact that, like his character, 
the geriatric Brits Patel is 
supposed to be palavering in 
his quest for exoticity also 
share the emotional density of 
a hologram. Still, the indignant 
asshole in me wavered. If I had 
to be completely honest, I’d 
be forced to admit there were 
stretches in both installments 
where I couldn’t help but crack 
at least a few smiles — the films 
are like two large spoonfuls of 
concentrated sugar, saccharine 
enough to make you beam in 
discomfort, 
water 
running 

down 
your 
face, 
whenever 

Dame Judi Dench exchanges 
flirty glances with the locals.

“Marigold” ’s problems share 

roots with “Skins” ’s strengths. 
In both cases, Patel starts 
encased inside scripts overladen 
with 
inflated 
dialogue 
but 

lacking 
any 
weighty 
plot 

turns. In “Skins,” he breaks 
out by gradually, wordlessly 
poking holes in his character’s 
homophobia while the audience 
heaps sympathy in his direction 
precisely because Anwar is 
struggling 
with 
real 
moral 

dilemmas on screen, and he’s 
so obviously doing it without 
any help from the script. It’s a 
home run that floats on Patel’s 
acting chops, yet still manages 
to arc alongside the cheap 
melodramatic tics of its source 
material.

“Marigold” never gets past 

the window dressing.

The 
most 
disheartening 

aspect of watching it swallow 
up Patel and spit him out 
as a tokenized caricature is 
realizing how little anyone 
cares, how often it’s heralded as 
an insightful portrait of aging 
— nothing more, nothing less. 
Most Indians I know watch the 
film because it’s a chance to see 
versions of themselves in the 
limelight, then laugh it off for 
its hazy, unrealistic portrayal 
of India. As long as old people 
are 
buying 
matinee 
tickets 

and Rotten Tomatoes labels it 
endearing, why not kowtow to 
stereotypes?

When the credits rolled, I 

wanted to continue seething in 
that pit of outrage. I wanted to 
keep my finger pointed squarely 
at Hollywood. But the fact of 
the matter is Patel is content to 
pick a role that sees its entire 
moral arc hinge around his 
character’s preparation for a 
wedding reception, the wedding 
reception 
during 
which 
he 

will dance to the Bollywood-
themed song that will in turn 
become the climactic musical 
centerpiece for the film.

It’s work. And in a perfect 

world, 
there 
would 
be 
no 

inaccuracy in simply labeling 
this as one of those “for the 
money” jobs actors take to pay 
off the mortgage on a fifth 
house. Yet, in an industry with 
little to no set roles for people 
with brown skin — on either 
side of the camera — it makes 
sense why Patel would have 
extra incentive to spend screen 
time solidifying his image as 
the face that most often comes 
to mind when Americans think 
“Indian.” This is the tradeoff 
films like “Marigold” demand.

It’s fucking terrifying in 

that “I feel bad for this filthy 
rich celebrity” kind of way, 
true, though more so when 
one considers the bottleneck 
glaring down any person of 
color looking for an in, no 
matter how small.

So when Aziz Ansari says 

his last three roles were Randy, 
Chet and Tom — not Kumar, 
Vishnu and Sandeep — should 
it be a point of pride, the ideal 
end-goal? No. Because saying 
so implies there is no space 
for 
Indian-American 
stories 

to fit through the bottleneck. 
Because Aziz has never worked 
with an Indian-American writer 
or director in his entire film 
career. Because the only Indian-
American writer-director Dev 
Patel has ever worked with is M. 
Night Shyamalan. And because, 
in that case, the character he 
played was a Chinese teenager 
named Zuko.

Seth is rapidly running out of 

shit, literally and metaphorically.

‘It Follows’ brings 
art back to horror

Innovative score 

and cinematography 
terrify and captivate

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

When “It Follows” begins, we 

don’t see “It,” but we see her. In 
one fluid shot, a distraught girl 
in a thin shirt 
sprints through 
her 
peace-

ful 
suburban 

neighborhood, 
desperately 
seeking refuge 
from something. 
Scratchy, pulsat-
ing synths blare 
as she refuses 
help from a well-meaning neigh-
bor, dodges past her father, jumps 
straight into her car and floors 
it. Her trembling body is small 
against an expansive beach as she 
calls her parents and tells them she 
loves them. Next is a jarring, front-
on view of her dead body, leg bent 
bloodily at a gruesome angle and 
high heel dangling dangerously off 
her foot. “It” has arrived.

“It Follows” ’s subtle terror 

comes not from gore or jump-
scares, but from a monster that 
embodies no defining characteris-
tic. We first meet Jay (Maika Mon-
roe, “Labor Day”) floating lazily in 
her backyard pool. She spots a bug 
on her arm, inspects it and serene-
ly lowers it back into the water. 
But her peace is quickly shattered. 
After having sex with her boy-
friend, she finds herself haunted 
by a monster only she can see. It 
takes on different manifestations 
each time, but always comes for 
her slowly and purposefully. Her 
boyfriend informs her that if “It” 
kills her, It will come back for him, 

and the only way to escape is to 
pass “It” on.

The physical forms of “It” 

are not, themselves, scary. The 
unyielding persistence and vacant 
stares make them so. Ultimately, 
“It” ’s origin and purpose go unex-
plained, so the victims cannot even 
fully understand their tormentor. 
Nothing is more terrifying than 
battling the unknown, except the 
added sting of the curse – doing it 
alone. The haunting operates like a 
psychological illness. Because only 
its victims can see “It,” Jay’s loyal 
friends remain a step removed 
from her experience and cannot 
truly help her despite their best 
efforts.

Central to the quiet unease 

is 
the 
film’s 
mood-setting 

soundtrack, provided by Bay 
Area composer and producer 
Disasterpeace. Breathy, atmo-
spheric sounds and dissonant 
synthetics swell around the 
film’s gloomy visuals. The set-
ting slices out a bleak alternate 
universe in which time stands 
still. Cell phones coexist with 
grainy 
black-and-white 
TV. 

Parents or daily routines don’t 
intervene. A tense haze clings, 

refusing to detach, and only “It” 
soldiers forward.

The film constructs an intricate 

dialogue about innocence and 
intimacy. Sex sparked the monster, 
and the loss of innocence brings 
an underlying sense of anxiety. At 
first, the film is set in a tranquil, 
well-maintained 
suburb, 
but 

after “It” strikes, the backdrop 
shifts to blighted Detroit streets. 
Once removed from childhood’s 
protective bubble, responsibility 
falls on Jay alone. Despite what 
overtly seems like an STD-scare 
metaphor, the film implies more 
than just abstinence. Though 
intimacy spells death, it’s also the 
only way to stay alive. In this way, 
real-life horror blends with the 
supernatural as Jay grapples with 
emotional trauma and the difficult 
decision of how and to whom she 
should pass “It” on.

Intelligently made and truly 

petrifying, “It Follows” harnesses 
our basest fears about intimacy 
and the unknown. We may laugh 
at lurid special effects, indulge in 
waves of blood that we know could 
never prevail in reality, but emo-
tionally devastating victimhood? 
That’ll get to you.

Zayn directionless

By GIBSON JOHNS

Daily Arts Writer

Boy bands aren’t supposed to 

last forever. We all know that. At a 
certain point in their unrelenting 
reigns over pop music, the hyste-
ria dies down, the boys become 
men, the fans’ interest wanes, 
their sound evolves and, eventu-
ally, a band member decides that 
they’re over it. Justin Timberlake 
broke off from *NSYNC to go solo. 
A.J. McLean went to rehab and 
Kevin Richardson temporarily left 
the Backstreet Boys soon thereaf-
ter. The Jonas Brothers broke up 
when Nick wanted to venture out 
on his own. And, of course, Zayn 
Malik left One Direction last week 
because he wanted to have a “nor-
mal” life and record solo material.

Yet, despite how predictable 

the life cycle of a boy band may 
be, the news of a member leaving 
will always be met with shock and 
passionate disappointment. In the 
case of One Direction — the first of 
their kind to rise to stardom in the 
age of social media — that intense 
reaction was even stronger than it 
would have been, say, 10 years ago. 
When the news of Zayn’s depar-
ture broke last Wednesday, it was 
absolutely unavoidable. The reac-
tions from fans and non-fans alike 
made headlines themselves as 
everyone tried to make sense of an 
announcement that, really, wasn’t 
that difficult to understand.

When Simon Cowell brought 

the boys back from the brink of 
elimination on “The X Factor UK” 
to form a five-piece boy band, it 
was, in the world of singing com-
petition series on television, a rela-
tively revolutionary decision. And 
it paid off in a bigger way than any-
one could have imagined. From 
the moment they started singing 
Natalie Imbruglia’s “Torn” the 
first time they performed together, 
it was clear that Simon was onto 
something. You could see the 
money signs reflecting off of his 
jet black aviators as the group of 
teenage boys confidently crooned 
in front of him. Week after week, 
the One Direction hysteria grew — 
both online and offline. As is cus-
tomary to competitions like “The 
X Factor UK,” though One Direc-
tion didn’t technically “win,” they 
were the de facto champions that 
year. They had cultivated a mas-
sive fanbase and became a house-
hold name, but were free from the 
contractual stipulations that came 
with coming in first place. Until 
their debut single, the still-catchy 
“What Makes You Beautiful,” 
was released almost a year after 
their formation, support for the 
boys online spread like wildfire 
around the world. Led mostly, but 
not exclusively, by teenage girls, 
the Directioners used social media 

to back their boys and spread the 
word about the world’s most excit-
ing boy band since the early ’00s.

There were — and still are — a 

lot of things to like about One 
Direction that set them apart 
from the boy bands of yester-
year. They didn’t dance or wear 
matching outfits. They each had 
an individual style that at once set 
them apart from one another and 
helped them to remain a compat-
ible, multi-dimensional unit. Their 
boyish camaraderie, though defi-
nitely played up, was genuine and 
not manufactured. They pantsed 
and poked each other’s butts on 
stage. In interviews, they made 
fun of each other and displayed 
their cheeky British humor that 
was borderline inappropriate for 
their young fans, but appealed to 
their mothers enough to make 
them the “ok” kind of bad boys.

But, perhaps most importantly, 

every member of One Direction 
has his own discernible singing 
voice and personality that indi-
vidual fans can latch onto. Harry, 
Liam, Niall, Louis and Zayn are 
different, unique young men and 
they aren’t trying to hide that. 
Despite their love for One Direc-
tion as a whole, every Directioner 
has a favorite. There aren’t just one 
or two standouts because they’re 
all standouts in different ways. 
And this wasn’t the case for the 
boy bands of years past. Find me 
one person who claims their favor-
ite member of *NSYNC was Chris 
Kirkpatrick or anyone who liked 
Kevin Jonas better than Nick or 
Joe. Seriously. Part of One Direc-
tion’s mass appeal is that their 
members and fans celebrate their 
collective individuality and, in an 
age when social media allows for 
more niche fan bases to flourish, 
that is a very powerful quality to 
have when put all together.

Unfortunately, 
that 
didn’t 

stop One Direction from follow-
ing the same path that every boy 
band seems destined to follow. 
Because boy bands have such 
short life spans, the rate of their 
music production and touring and 
appearances has been increas-

ingly accelerated. One Direction 
has been touring seemingly non-
stop for three years, and they’ve 
released four albums in four years. 
As a group of men that are growing 
up themselves and trying to find 
their own identities in this world, 
it’s no surprise that it eventually 
became too much for one of them 
to handle. Performing bubblegum 
pop — presumably not the type of 
music that Zayn Malik would pre-
fer to be singing — for sold out are-
nas of screaming, hysterical young 
girls must have been exhausting. 
That’s a lot of pressure.

For a little over half a year 

now, One Direction’s goofy 
lads-will-be-lads dynamic has 
been fading. When I saw them 
perform last summer, it was 
clear that something was off, 
specifically with Zayn. Wheth-
er he was bored or blazed (he 
was probably a little bit of both), 
there was rarely a smile on his 
bangs-covered 
face 
and 
he 

dragged his feet on stage while 
the other four acted the way 
they always have. The energy 
was unbalanced.

So, the signs have been there. 

From a personal perspective, 
Zayn’s decision to leave One 
Direction makes sense. But that 
doesn’t make it any easier to 
come to terms with. What will 
One Direction be without him? 
They’re going to continue as a 
foursome, but it’s hard to imagine 
that some, or a lot, of their magic 
will disappear. I’d imagine that 
they’ll fare a bit better than the 
post-Geri Halliwell Spice Girls 
did, but who really knows? Zayn 
will try his hand at a solo career 
and he’ll probably find success 
(he’s the best singer of the group), 
but I don’t think he has the per-
sonality of someone destined for 
prolonged success as a solo artist. 
That seems to be more part of the 
increasingly Mick Jagger-esque 
Harry Styles’s trajectory.

They’re still the guys we have 

always loved, but One Direction 
will never be the same without 
Zayn. It’s sad just how fast the 
night changes.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

‘Transatlantique’ is 
bare and beautiful

By KARL WILLIAMS

Daily Arts Writer

“Transatlantique” is Montre-

al-based documentary filmmak-
er 
Felix 
Dufour-Laperriere’s 

debut 
feature-
length 
film, 
which 
follows 
the lives 
of work-
ers trav-
eling 
across the Atlantic on a cargo 
ship. Dufour-Laperriere’s film 
made its American debut at the 
53rd Ann Arbor Film Festival.

Of course, the well-known 

mantra is “it’s about the journey, 
not the destination.” While not 
necessarily adventurous, “Trans-
atlantique” is concerned only with 
the voyage. It eschews the facts of 
plot and the mechanisms of narra-
tive, instead focusing on the expe-
rience of the crew members amid 
the wide expanse of the Atlantic. 
Neither the departing point nor 
the destination are made clear. 
Men talk, but there is no dialogue. 
There are no characters, only men. 
Every man remains anonymous, 
even when the film tracks the inti-

mate details of their daily lives. 
Although the workers are presum-
ably from India — they play cricket 
and seem to speak Hindi — this is 
never made explicit, like most of 
the detail in the film.

Indeed, 
Dufour-Laperriere’s 

film is a documentary in the most 
minimalist sense of the word. It 
documents the lives of the voyag-
ers as lived without adornment, 
reveling in the banality of life at 
sea isolated from larger social 
interactions. 
There 
are 
large 

stretches that depict basic human 
activity: men eat, read, prepare for 
work in the morning, play board 
games, pray, etc. Dufour-Laper-
riere reduces the content of the 
film to the minute activity of these 
men, but avoids the trap of becom-
ing tedious itself.

Much of the film oscillates 

between sequences of the ocean 
and those of human activity. This 
formula risks redundancy, but 
evades it. Many of the images of 
the sea are shot at different angles, 
and each is stunning. There are 
some scenes that seem to have 
been shot from beneath the water, 
which are particularly incredible.

In fact, “Transatlantique” is 

surprisingly enthralling and fasci-
nating throughout its entirety, due 
in large part to its cinematography 

and score. Filmed in black and 
white, the cinematography catches 
the beauty of the sea along with its 
monotony and treachery. If based 
solely on visual criteria, “Transat-
lantique” is one of the most beauti-
ful films one will ever see.

Dufour-Laperriere seems to be 

well versed in the European cine-
ma of the 1960s, especially Michel-
angelo Antonioni and Federico 
Fellini. Aesthetically, “Transatlan-
tique” compares well to a film such 
as Antonioni’s “L’Avventura,” most 
notably in each work’s depiction of 
the sea. However, Dufour-Laper-
riere’s film has the advantage of 
being shot digitally, intensifying 
the clarity of the images and cre-
ating a more powerful cinematic 
effect. The contrast between white 
and black in the film is wondrous-
ly strange. The white is almost 
unbearable, and the black is total. 
At times the screen will shift from 
total darkness to intolerable lumi-
nescence with no warning.

The cinematography is accen-

tuated by a powerful score that 
blends immaculately. The score 
is soft and, at times, nearly unde-
tectable. But it fuses incredibly 
well with the stark images. The 
score captures the latent annihila-
tion lurking beneath the glittering 
facade of the sea.

La Distributrice

Sufjan strikes again

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

As I sit in the Starbucks on State 

Street, light rain grazing the win-
dows and plaguing the faces of 
incoming 
cus-

tomers, I figure 
it’s a good time 
to listen to Suf-
jan Stevens. I’m 
sipping coffee; I 
feel existential 
and introspec-
tive. The weath-
er is cementing 
these 
feelings. 

So let’s go, Stevens. Throw me all 
the emotional hoopla you’ve got.

Stevens, first name pronounced 

“Soof-yahn,” is a Michigan native 
and master of eliciting what hip 
young kids are calling “the feels.” 
A graduate of Hope College and 
The New School, his intelligent 
lyrics, melodic inventiveness and 
directional fearlessness make him 
both a critical darling and cult 
favorite. And he’s been at it since 
2000 — a veteran, to be sure, yet 
consistently youthful in sound.

So what exactly does his career 

entail? His genre, his trajectory 
thus far — it’s all so impossible to 
pinpoint. He’s been everywhere 
and done everything. Notable 
endeavors include (but aren’t 
limited to) the following: a folky, 
orchestral album set in Chicago 
concerning all things emotional 
and Midwestern (Illinois, 2005); 
a conflicted, wondrously com-
plex electronic beast rooted in the 
vibrant Louisiana (The Age of Adz, 
2010); a buxom, five-disc Christ-
mas extravaganza (Songs for 
Christmas, 2006) and more. Many 
more. Indeed, the aforementioned 
trio deserves a deep listen, vanilla 
latte in hand.

As for 2015’s Carrie & Lowell? 

Well, that deserves everything.

The first few notes of “Death 

with Dignity,” the opening track, 
cooingly allow the listener to know 
they have embarked on some sort 
of ethereal, profoundly sad jour-
ney. It’s one of the strongest on 
the album. “I don’t know where to 
begin,” Stevens sings in his frag-
ile, pleading whisper. Never has a 

voice that sounds like the irresist-
ibly thin glass vase in your house 
— you know, the one that will shat-
ter into tragic chunks if dropped 
(sorry, mom) — sounded so stun-
ning. Dreamy, plucked acoustic 
guitar weeps along with Stevens 
as he ventures this time to Eugene, 
Oregon — a land of painful, poetic 
and potent shards of the past.

The two figureheads of the 

album, Carrie and Lowell, fea-
tured on the cover in all their ’80s 
glory, are vital to understanding 
Stevens’s pain. His mother, Carrie, 
suffered from depression, schizo-
phrenia and substance abuse all 
her life; she left the family when 
Stevens was a baby because she 
thought herself unfit to raise 
children. Carrie married Lowell 
Brams soon after, and Stevens and 
his siblings traveled to their home 
in Oregon for a few summers dur-
ing his childhood. These trips 
house the only memories he has of 
Carrie; Stevens struggled with the 
sparseness of their relationship 
and his surprising grief upon her 
passing in 2012.

You can hear the struggle in 

almost every song on the album. 
“Carrie & Lowell,” the title track, 
is a moving ode to that elusive duo 
complete with hymn-like harmo-
nies (think: “Scarborough Fair” by 
Simon & Garfunkel. Carrie & Low-
ell, Simon & Garfunkel. Stevens 
must have a thing for duos.)

“Should Have Known Better” 

and “Eugene” sound interestingly 
child-like, etched with pretty, 
subtle piano and simple melodies. 
They’re semi-pleasant and serve a 
great contrast to tunes like “All of 
Me Wants All of You,” a song with 
introverted lyrics like “I trace your 
shadow with my shoe.” I have no 
idea what that means, but it made 
me cry in public. So thanks, Ste-
vens. Good things, good things.

Soft but pounding strumming 

propels us forward on “Drawn to 
the Blood.” Here, Stevens reaches 
his falsetto for a few precious sec-
onds in the chorus and descends 
soon after, soulfully mirroring the 
ups and downs of a wail. Almost 
all of the songs on the album fol-
low this sob-inspired structure 
melodically. They tend to crescen-

do about half way through, as you 
would at the peak of a mournful 
cry (“Fourth of July”), and then 
they sigh their way back down 
toward the end — the cleansing, 
regulating aftermath (“The Only 
Thing”). Breathe in, breathe out 
and cap it off with some misty, dis-
sonant chords. It works.

One of the chilling things 

about Sufjan Stevens is his lyrical 
repetition. In “Casmir Pulaski 
Day” off Illinois, as he’s doubting 
God’s intentions after the death 
of a friend, he whispers, “and He 
takes, and He takes, and He takes.” 
All it takes is this redundancy to 
do you in for good — similarly, as 
he gently croons “We’re all gonna 
die” on “Fourth of July,” the 
listener is in shambles by the fifth 
time around. Religious tones also 
seep through on Carrie & Lowell. 
“John My Beloved” has Stevens 
looking to perhaps the eponymous 
disciple 
for 
strength 
over 
a 

beautifully stripped background. 
“No Shade in the Shadow of the 
Cross” is equally heart-wrenching, 
and “Blue Bucket of Gold” is a 
captivatingly 
melancholy-yet-

hopeful end to a tremendous 
musical feat for Stevens.

Simplistic folk takes the front 

seat — there’s no tinkering with 
genres, electronics, tempos or keys 
here. It’s just a man and his guitar 
— against the world, like Elliott 
Smith or Bob Dylan? Not quite, 
though the album has hints of both 
of these gents. Rather, Stevens is 
strumming against the death of 
a soul (perhaps the soul). In that 
way, this is folk taken to the next 
level. Carrie would’ve been proud.

As I finish the album, I think 

about a certain theory regarding 
death — one that proposes that the 
inevitable end of one human paves 
the way for the creation of another. 
Stevens said in an interview with 
Pitchfork that he doesn’t plan on 
having kids, as he’s slightly jaded 
from his own dissatisfying expe-
rience with family. So maybe his 
baby is this album, the bones from 
which he builds a freshly contem-
plative genre of folk — full of life. 
A new life.

I look up from my seat. It 

stopped raining.

DEFENDING
HOME TERP

Michigan tops Maryland, 

5-2, to take two out of 
three in home series

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

Sunday, the Michigan baseball team 

picked up right where it left off Saturday. 

In the wake of a 10-2 victory over No. 20 

Maryland (18-7, 4-2 Big Ten) in the second 
game of Saturday’s doubleheader, the Wol-
verines (14-12, 2-4) topped the Terrapins, 
5-2, Sunday to take two out of the three 
weekend games.

“I’m proud of the way our guys respond-

ed after a tough weekend last weekend 
(at Nebraska),” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich, referring to last weekend’s sweep. 
“They responded with a great week of train-
ing. To see that carry over into (this week-
end’s) games was what we needed.”

Michigan’s offense wasted no time scor-

ing runs. The barrage came in the bottom of 
the first inning.

With junior third baseman Jacob Cronen-

worth and freshman shortstop Jake Bivens 
on first and second bases, respectively, and 
no one out, senior centerfielder Jackson 
Glines hit a single to center field, scoring 
Cronenworth. Sophomore first baseman 
Carmen Benedetti followed up with a single 
of his own to drive in Bivens and make the 
score 2-0.

Junior left fielder Cody Bruder then hit 

a bunt single that advanced Benedetti and 
Glines to second and third, respectively. 
That prompted Maryland coach John Szefc 
to pull starting pitcher Willie Rios in favor 
of Taylor Sties before Rios was able to 
record a single out.

“We needed to come out and set the tone,” 

Bakich said. “We were on the other side of 
that coin last weekend.”

The Wolverines did not stop there, 

though. Senior designated hitter Kyle Jusick 
quickly smacked a three-RBI double to put 
the Wolverines up 5-0.

“The guys before me got some great at-

bats, and I was able to get a pitch I could 
drive,” Jusick said. “It’s really nice to be see-
ing the ball well and to be able to help the 
team out.”

After that, Stiles settled down and 

pitched seven scoreless innings, retiring the 
last 16 batters he faced. But the Terrapins’ 
offense could not dig their team out of the 
hole.

“Stiles was filling up the strike zone,” 

Bakich said. “It’s hard to put together 
offense when the opposing pitcher isn’t 
walking people.”

The situation briefly got tense for Michi-

gan in the third when sophomore southpaw 
Brett Adcock surrendered two RBI singles 
to chip the lead to 5-2. But he got Maryland’s 
Tim Lewis to pop out to Bivens, who threw 
to Jacobson to tag the runner out at second, 
ending the threat.

“Double plays are always huge momen-

tum swings for the defense,” Bakich said.

The Wolverines’ bullpen put the team 

on their backs in the last several frames. 
After sophomore left-hander Brett Adcock 
was pulled after four innings, freshman 
righty Jayce Vancetta pitched four scoreless 
frames to earn the win, and freshman right-
hander Bryan Pall closed out the game, 
picking up his first career save. Pall now 
has 14 strikeouts on the season with a 0.59 
earned-run average over 15.1 innings.

“We feel really good about Bryan Pall at 

the end of the game,” Bakich said. 

While winning a series against a ranked 

opponent is no small feat, Michigan will 
have little time to celebrate. The Wolverines 
will take on Toledo and Central Michigan 
on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, 
before resuming Big Ten play at Indiana 
next weekend.

The things you don’t hear in 

Michigan athletics

N

ever before has there 
been a year as unpre-
dictable and unflatter-

ing in Michigan athletics.

The 

football, 
men’s 
basketball 
and hockey 
teams all 
failed to 
make the 
postseason. 
Now, one 
of the few 
bright spots 
at a time 
when even Congress possibly 
had a better year is the men’s 
swimming and diving team, 
which finished third at the 
NCAA Championships this 
weekend.

It’s a crazy time to be a 

fan in Ann Arbor. So much is 
changing and happening, so 
many feats have been reached 
that even the most seasoned 
fans aren’t quite sure what to 
expect. The one constant, when 
the athletic director, football 
coach and even PR staffs have 
been replaced in the same 
offseason, are the statements 
everybody hears time after 
time.

The “We just didn’t execute” 

and “I have to do a better job 
coaching” after losses. Or even 
after wins: “We played great 
one-pitch softball.” Even, 
“We’re not looking ahead to 
Ohio State.”

But some sentences have 

never been uttered in the 
history of Michigan athletics. 
Some of them are just as 
strange — perhaps worthy of 
Rick Reilly’s ideas in the back 
page of Sports Illustrated — as 
the year going on right now:

“I’m not sure Jim Harbaugh 

is the right guy for the football 
program.”

“Guys, finish your drinks, 

we’ve gotta get to the field 
hockey game.”

“I’ll say it again, Red 

Berenson is ready to rock the 
cover of GQ.”

“Gee, I’ll tell ya, I don’t know 

how they’re going to fit all 
the students into the student 
section at the Big House this 
year.”

“I’ve never been intimidated 

by Hutch. I mean, I just don’t 
understand how she’s supposed 
to inspire her team. Maybe 
she’s past her prime?”

“I don’t know what makes 

these gymnasts so special. 
Anybody could stick a 
Yurchenko one-and-a-half, 
right?”

“There 

goes John 
Beilein on 
another one 
of his loud, 
uneducated 
tirades again. 
Guy can’t 
control his 
temper.”

“Are you 

going to head to the men’s golf 
invite right after class, or are 
you going home first?”

“Nah, the hockey team said 

they were tired of Rick’s. Think 
they said they would rather stay 
in, maybe watch a movie.”

“Yeah, Adam Coon, I’m 

talking to you, all 6-foot-5, 285 
pounds of you. ‘You’re soft.’ ”

“Crap, there aren’t any 

tickets left for Saturday’s 
women’s rowing regatta.”

“I’m serious, we’ve gotta 

hurry if we’re going to make 
it to the field hockey game on 
time.”

“Don’t worry, I should 

definitely be back in time 
tonight after the baseball 
team’s doubleheader. They 
don’t run very long.”

“Sometimes, I think there 

are too many people covering 
women’s water polo. I can’t 
even be on Twitter for 10 
minutes without someone 
talking about it.”

“No, Mr. five-star recruit, the 

weather doesn’t get that cold up 
here. You really won’t notice.”

“Time Magazine’s 10 most 

secure jobs today: Michigan 
Athletic Director.”

“What do you mean you 

didn’t go to the soccer game? 
It’s so close to everything on 
campus.”

“Do you ever think that 

sometimes the Michigan 
communications staff gives 

the media too 
much access?”

“How are 

the men’s 
and women’s 
track and field 
teams always 
shattering 
attendance 
records?”

“No mom, 

I was just sleeping in before 
the football game. It started at 
noon, after all.”

“Yeah Alejandro, I’m telling 

you, the Michigan volleyball 
team was absolutely checking 
you out.”

“I get all my gear from the 

M-Den, since everything is so 
appropriately priced.”

“Has anyone heard anything 

good about this guy Jabrill 
Peppers?”

“Yeah, I think Spike Albrecht 

definitely has a chance to go out 
with Kate Upton.”

“I don’t know about you, but 

the Maize Rage would probably 

be better if it wasn’t in the 
lower bowl.”

“And for the sixth 

consecutive time, the State 
News has defeated The 
Michigan Daily at football. The 
better journalists win again.”

“I’m not sure Michigan has 

enough depth at quarterback 
this year. It should probably get 
another one before the season 
starts.”

“The basketball team can’t 

win unless it recruits like Duke 
or Kentucky. Beilein can never 
make it work.”

“I’m tired of the women’s 

basketball team always being 
talked about. Why do they get 
all the credit?”

“Alright, last chance. We 

either get to field hockey before 
the gates open or we don’t get 
in at all.”

“One of these days, the 

men’s swimming team is 
bound to win a conference 
championship.”

“God, where can a man find 

some khakis in Ann Arbor 
these days?”

“They upgraded the lacrosse 

facilities again? Geeze, they get 
all the nice stuff.”

“Do you think there will be 

enough time to drink before 
this year’s night game?”

“Don’t forget, today’s guest 

lecturer on e-mail etiquette, 
Dave Brandon, is speaking at 
12:52. Don’t be late.”

“That Garno kid sure seems

‘M’ places third at NCAAs

By RAJAT KHARE

Daily Sports Editor

Senior Bruno Ortiz strode 

somberly behind fellow seniors 
Richard 
Funk 
and 
Justin 

Glanda. Before reaching the 
podium, he looked up, took in 
the moment and wiped away at 
his left eye. He realized then, 
perhaps, that this moment would 
be the last time the lights would 
ever shine as bright as they had 
throughout his illustrious career 
at Michigan.

At the end of the three days 

at the Campus Wellness and 
Recreation 
Center 
in 
Iowa 

City, the fifth-ranked Michigan 
men’s swimming team finished 
in third-place at the NCAA 
Championships.

After a dominant regular 

season, 
one 
in 
which 
the 

Wolverines 
were 
undefeated 

in the Big Ten, followed up 
with a fifth straight Big Ten 
Championship, it was the final 
accolade earned by the seniors 
under the block ‘M’ banner.

First place at NCAAs wasn’t 

expected of this team, but it 
would have been the perfect way 
to end the script.

“Richard Funk gave a speech 

to the team at the end of the 
meet of how proud he was of the 
team because we don’t have the 
talent of teams that we competed 
against,” said Michigan coach 
Mike Bottom. “But we have the 
work ethic, and we have the 
ability to be creative and make 
changes and stand up to some 
of these teams that have a little 
more talent, actually a lot more 
talent than we do.”

Qualifying 
five 
freshmen 

out of a group of 12 swimmers, 
Michigan 
always 
knew 
it 

would be a tall order to send 
off its seniors with their second 
national championship in four 
years. To accomplish the feat, 
it would have to defeat the 
toughest competition it faced 
all season, going up against 
perennial powerhouses Texas, 
Florida and California.

At the conclusion of day one, 

Michigan sat in fourth place, just 
14 and three points out of second 
and third place, respectively. 

And it was the upperclassmen, 
Ortiz and junior Anders Nielsen, 
leading 
the 
way, 
helping 

Michigan finish with 105 points.

“My goal for the team was 

a top-five finish,” Bottom said. 
“We lost such a great class 
last year with Connor Jaeger 
and Mike Wynalda, and the 
list goes on and on and on. No 
one expected that class to be 
replaced, but this team actually 
had a better finish than that 
class. It just shows the character 
of this senior class that led this 
team: Justin Glanda, Bruno 
Ortiz and Richard Funk.”

Ortiz 
helped 
Michigan 

score its first points of the 
Championships, 
anchoring 

the 200-yard freestyle relay 
team of freshman Paul Powers, 
sophomore Vincent Tafuto and 
Glanda to a seventh-place finish. 
He followed up the effort with a 
fourth-place finish in the 400-
yard medley relay alongside 
freshman Aaron Whitaker, Funk 
and junior Dylan Bosch with 
a seventh-place finish in the 
50-yard freestyle in between.

“When I was a freshman, 

sophomore and junior, I wanted 
to score points for the team, 
just simply, just that,” Ortiz 
said. “Right now (as a senior), 
I just want to inspire the team 
and thinking that this is my last 
chance to represent Michigan, 
I want to give the freshmen a 
message of how to represent 
Michigan.”

Though Ortiz swam in six 

races on the day, it was Nielsen 
who had the highest individual 
finish for the Wolverines on the 
night, placing fourth in the 500-
yard freestyle. Clocking in at 
4:12.16, Nielsen set a career best 
for himself and etched his name 
in Michigan’s record books as 
the fourth-fastest time ever in 
the event.

Day 
two 
saw 
veteran 

members of the squad step up, 
as it was Nielsen who again 
had the highest finish for the 
Wolverines. A runner up in the 
200-yard freestyle team with a 
time of 1:32.72, Nielsen posted 
the second-fastest time in school 
history in the event.

In 
the 
relays, 
though, 

Michigan faltered, missing out 
on the finals in the 200-yard 
medley. A strength of the team 
all year, the relay team instead 
had to settle for a first-place 
finish in the consolation final.

Despite the medley result, the 

Wolverines were able to add to 
their point total by way of fifth- 
and seventh-place finishes in 
the 100-yard breaststroke from 
Funk and Ortiz, respectively. 
Clocking in at 51.65 and 51.68, the 
pair became the first swimmers 
to break the 52-second mark for 
Michigan.

Clinging onto a slim overall 

lead on day three, Michigan 
was uplifted by an unexpected 
performance 
from 
freshman 

PJ Ransford. Competing in the 
1,650-yard freestyle, Ransford 
nearly pulled off a stunning 
finish. He led for most of the 
event but was unable to hold 
off a push from Matias Koski of 
Georgia, placing him second in 
the event with a 14:34.36.

“(Coach Bottom) just said to 

stay focused, swim for the team, 
swim for Michigan and you’ll be 
fine,” Ransford said. “They just 
kept saying that over and over, 
and it all worked out well for all 
of us.”

Still without an outright win, 

relay or otherwise, Michigan was 
hopeful it would come in the 200-
yard butterfly by way of another 
upperclassman in Bosch. He won 
the event in 2014, setting the 
NCAA record with a 1:39.33.

Bosch seemed to go stroke for 

stroke with Jack Conger from 

Texas out of the blocks. Down 
the stretch, though, Conger’s 
teammate 
Joseph 
Schooling 

came from behind, out-touching 
both Conger and Bosch, sending 
the latter to a third-place finish.

By the time the final event 

of the 400-yard freestyle relay 
rolled around, Texas, California 
and 
Michigan 
had 
already 

secured their first-, second- and 
third-place finishes, respectively. 
The quartet of Powers, Nielsen, 
Glanda and Ortiz placed sixth 
in the event, but, at that point, 
it was all about enjoying the last 
swim for Michigan for the two 
seniors.

“This pool, this Iowa pool, 

it was my first championship 
meet here my freshman year and 
even Big Ten’s, the first year it 
was here,” Ortiz said. “And even 
ending my career here, I don’t 
know, it’ s just so many memories 
as a whole, and, each race, those 
memories came back to me.”

When the Wolverines walk 

back into Canham Natatorium 
next year, there won’t be an 
NCAA Championship banner 
hanging from the 2014-2015 
season to greet them. And there 
won’t be an NCAA event title 
to defend. Instead, there will 
be hardware in the trophy case 
anointing 
them 
third-place 

finishers at the Championships.

But for a team with little 

business being in third place, for 
Ortiz, Funk and Glanda, perhaps 
the ending was fitting of the 
memories they had created at 
Michigan.

Michigan can’t 
solve Maryland

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s lacrosse 

team didn’t bring the right 
demolition crew to College Park 
on Sunday when it tried to smash 
through the nation’s No. 1 defense.

It took the Wolverines nearly 

the entire first half to find their 
opening goal, as the Maryland 
defense kept them in check on 
the way to a 13-4 victory.

In addition to facing the nation’s 

top defense, junior specialist Brad 
Lott had his hands full taking 
faceoffs against the Terrapins’ 
senior midfielder Charlie Raffa, 
who ranks in the top 10 nationally 
in faceoff win percentage. Raffa 
dominated all Michigan faceoff 
men he faced, winning 11 of his 14 
draws on the day.

“There’s not really a lot you 

can do when the other team 
is dominating faceoffs,” said 
Michigan coach John Paul. “It’s 
such a tough matchup. (Raffa is) 
one of the top faceoff men in the 
country, and there’s not a magic 
pill you take and suddenly start 
winning faceoffs against top 
guys.”

Heading into the half, it 

appeared the Wolverines (0-1 
Big Ten, 4-5 overall) were still 
within arm’s reach of catching 
up to No. 3 Maryland (9-1, 1-0). 
Junior midfielder Kyle Jackson 
netted Michigan’s opening goal 
with 67 seconds left in the half, 
bringing the Wolverines within 
three goals of the Terrapins.

Before Jackson’s goal, the 

Michigan 
offense 
looked 

completely incapable of breaking 
down Maryland’s solid defense, 
struggling to maintain possession 
and find a finishing touch on 
shooting. The Wolverines were 
especially vulnerable due to 
weak stick work, giving up a total 
of 11 turnovers Sunday.

Michigan 
was 
without 

sophomore attacker Ian King, 
who, despite being out the last 
four games, still leads the team 
in scoring. While replacing an 
attacker as talented as King has 
been nearly impossible, Paul still 
needs the Wolverines’ starting 
attackers to pick up some of the 
slack, something they failed to do 
so against Maryland.

“Our attackmen need to be 

more explosive,” Paul said. “They 
need to be challenging their 

defensemen a little more. Maybe 
that’s where (King) can help us 
in the coming weeks, but we still 
need some of these guys to step 
up consistently and win games 
and own that.”

On the other side of the field, 

Michigan’s 
defense 
absorbed 

attack after attack from a slow 
and methodical Terrapin offense. 
After conceding three goals in 
the first quarter, Michigan held 
Maryland to only one goal in the 
next period despite the Terrapins’ 
advantage in possession.

Six minutes into the second 

half, though, the Wolverines’ 
defense 
couldn’t 
hold 
the 

Terrapins’ 
attack 
back 
any 

longer. Maryland went on a 
5-0 run over the course of five 
minutes, putting itself up eight 
and crushing any hopes of a 
Michigan comeback.

The Wolverines were able to 

score three goals after halftime, 
including freshman midfielder 
Patrick Tracy’s first career goal. 
Tracy received extended minutes 
and also earned his first assist off 
of Jackson’s first goal.

“It felt nice to finally contribute 

to the team,” Tracy said. “(It) 
feels good to finally get over the 
hump and be able to help the 
team anyway I can. Personally, 
sticking to my strengths worked, 
especially with the assist.”

There was very little that 

went right for Michigan on 
Sunday, but Tracy and Jackson’s 
performances highlighted the 
Wolverines’ depth in midfield, 
which will be crucial in upcoming 
games.

With the matchup against the 

Big Ten favorite in Maryland out 
of the way, Michigan will focus 
this week on a crucial game 
against Rutgers. With a fourth-
place or better finish still a strong 
possibility for the Wolverines, 
they will surely refocus and carry 
forward some positives from 
Sunday.

“We talked about in the locker 

room afterward how our goals 
are still there and we still have 
incredible opportunities in front 
of us,” Paul said. “The guys 
were talking about that right 
after the game, and I think they 
understand how good Maryland 
is, but a lot of things have to go 
right to beat those guys, and 
we’re not the only ones who have 
figured that out.”

Michigan advances to WNIT semis

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

In its last five games, Southern 

Mississippi had clawed its way 
out of a double-digit deficit before 
coming 
back 
to 

win. 
So 

when 
the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team held a 32-13 lead with 3:42 
to go in the first half, it didn’t 
mean much.

Then, the Golden Eagles (13-5 

Conference USA, 25-11 overall) 
went on a 9-0 run, ending the 
first half on a buzzer-beating 
jumper. They wanted that sixth 
comeback, 
especially 
amidst 

their deepest postseason drive in 
program history.

“What they did to us at the 

end of the first half, I was kind 
of having a stomachache at 
halftime,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “I knew down 
the stretch it was going to be a 
battle. I knew they were going 
to double us, they were gonna 
pressure us (and) they were 
gonna throw everything at us.

“We were gonna have to make 

free throws, we were gonna have 
to take care of the ball and we 
were gonna have to respond, try 
to defend and make some stops.”

Sunday, those things needed to 

fall in place for Michigan to earn 
a win in front of a record-setting 
crowd of 5,480 in Hattiesburg, 
Mississippi. 
Though 
Barnes 

Arico’s stomach may have been 
churning at halftime, her team 
didn’t skip a beat during the 
second half en route to a 69-60 
win over Southern Mississippi.

The win sends the Wolverines 

(8-10 Big Ten, 20-14 overall) to 
their first WNIT semifinal since 
2010, and they will host UCLA on 
Wednesday night.

“Southern 
Mississippi 
had 

an incredible crowd,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Thought it made a 
difference in the game, and it 
kept the game really tight. Every 
time we tried to pulled away, they 
came back. … I thought it was 

an exciting basketball game for 
everyone.”

With a win over the Golden 

Eagles — the result of a balanced 
offense that had five players in 
double-digit scoring — Michigan 
eclipsed 20 wins for the fourth 
straight season. But in the final 
three minutes of the game, 
that reality almost escaped the 
Wolverines’ hold.

In the second half, Southern 

Mississippi showed its trademark 
skill, which is to take a blowout 
game and turn it into a single-
digit nail biter. Michigan once 
had a 17-point lead, but with 2:30 
to go in the game, it was down 
to five. Guard Jerontay Clemons 
completed a three-point play to 
put the game at 59-54 in favor of 
the Wolverines.

The Golden Eagles’ comeback 

looked inevitable, but it wouldn’t 
come to fruition.

“We held on, but that’s just the 

kind of team they are,” Barnes 
Arico said. “If you can get your 
team to play that hard all the time 
and to not quit when you’re down 
like that, that’s pretty special.”

Senior guard Shannon Smith 

made a jumper immediately 
after to get Michigan back 
in 
control, 
and 
Southern 

Mississippi’s offense fell apart. 
The Wolverines’ next eight points 
came from free throws, as the 
Golden Eagles were desperate to 
make anything fall. But Michigan 
continued to grab the defensive 
rebounds, preventing any sort of 
second-chance opportunities.

It wasn’t a final defensive 

lockdown by the Wolverines 
though, but instead a stellar 
first-half performance from the 
senior class that kept Michigan 
alive. With perfect shooting, the 
seniors — Smith and forwards 
Cyesha Goree and Nicole Elmblad 
— put the team in a position to 
handle any second-half runs 
from Southern Mississippi.

During the first 20 minutes, 

the senior trio shot a combined 
11-for-11, scoring 24 of Michigan’s 
first 32 points. Elmblad never 
missed a beat with her left-

handed shot and missed just two 
shots overall to total 14 points. 
Smith missed only one shot, with 
seven of her 11 points coming 
from the charity stripe.

As for Goree, she found 

herself packed in the paint with 
two or three Golden Eagles to 
trying to shut her down. But she 
remained relentless. With 15 
points alongside 12 boards, Goree 
recorded her 17th double-double 
this season. During the second 
half, though, she sat several 
minutes with three fouls — an 
absence that was most certainly 
felt.

That’s 
when 
Southern 

Mississippi made its move.

With 13:16 to go and Goree 

out, the Golden Eagles quickly 
chipped away at a double-digit 
deficit to cut the game to nine 
points. With no other option, 
Goree went back in, facing the 
risk of fouling out. Elmblad soon 

followed suit with a third foul of 
her own, putting more pressure 
on the guards to pick up the slack.

As the inside became a war 

zone, junior guard Madison 
Ristovski made a 2-point jumper 
26 seconds after Goree returned, 
and freshman guard Katelynn 
Flaherty 
carried 
the 
weight 

thereafter.

Flaherty 
scored 
just 
two 

points in the first half, but during 
the second frame, Barnes Arico 
moved Flaherty to the baseline. 
In the next six minutes after 
Ristovski’s 
basket, 
Flaherty 

scored all four baskets, also 
ending a four-minute scoring 
drought in that span.

“She is arguably one of the best 

shooters in the country, hands 
down,” Barnes Arico said. “She 
got tight in the first half, and 
I’m so happy she came out in 
the second half and didn’t stop 
shooting.”

Michigan drops 
Big Ten opener

By KATIE CONKLIN

Daily Sports Writer

It was a historic weekend 

for Big Ten women’s lacrosse, 
headlined 
by 
the 
first-ever 

games in its inaugural season.

While 

the 
conference 
may be new, many of the teams 
featured 
are 
anything 
but. 

With 
perennial 
powerhouse 

Maryland from the Atlantic 
Coast 
Conference, 
alongside 

another 
longtime 
contender 

in Northwestern, the Big Ten 
makes for stiff competition.

The 

Michigan 
women’s 
lacrosse team 
opened 
its 

Big Ten slate 
at Ohio State. 
Though 
off 

to 
a 
better 

start 
this 

season 
than 

last year, the 
Wolverines 
did not perform to what they 
consider to be the best of their 
abilities, losing to the Buckeyes, 
13-5.

Michigan 
sophomore 

midfielder Madeline Dion hit 
twine off a midfield transition 
to put the Wolverines up 
by a goal just 1:45 into the 
match. The lead did not last 
long, though, as the Buckeyes 
responded with four straight 
goals.

Sophomore midfielder Kim 

Coughlan, the only player to 
score more than one goal in 
the game, broke the Buckeyes’ 
streak by scoring with 19:12 left 
in the first half, but the tally 
was Michigan’s last goal for the 
next 30 minutes.

“We started slow on attack, 

and our communication was a 
little off,” Coughlan said.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

improved into the second half, 
there was no escaping the 8-2 
advantage Ohio State gained in 
the first stanza of the game.

“All 
season 
we’ve 
been 

trying to play for 60 minutes,” 
Ulehla 
said. 
“I’ve 
stressed 

the importance of coming up 
against the Big Ten. You can’t 
choose to play your own game.”

Playing for a full 60 minutes, 

or in some cases longer — as 
three of Michigan’s losses have 
been in overtime — has been 
something the Wolverine’s have 

struggled with 
this season.

Whether 

this difficulty 
is due to the 
team’s lack of 
experience or 
composure, 
they 
still 

don’t 
know. 

However, 
learning 
how to play a 

consistent game as a cohesive 
unit is one of Michigan’s top 
priorities.

“We’re not there yet but we 

keep talking about (playing 
consistently),” Coughlan said. 
“We’re still working on it and 
working to get to that point.”

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

didn’t come out on top in their 
first Big Ten matchup against 
Ohio State, there is a still an 
entire month before they could 
meet again in Piscataway in the 
Big Ten Tournament.

“This is definitely a good 

learning experience,” Coughlan 
said. “For the future, we’ll just 
be working on our plays and 
offense and communications 
and working more together as 
a team.”

‘M’ struggles continue

By DAVID MALINOWSKI

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

tennis 
team stumbled 
into 

the weekend with one of the 
worst records in team history. 
Against respectable Iowa (2-2 
Big Ten, 10-5 overall) and 
Nebraska 
(2-2, 
9-7) 
teams, 

the 
Wolverines’ 
fortunes 

were supposed to finally turn 
around.

Initially, 
Michigan 
(0-4, 

3-12) was cruising with a lead 
coming out of doubles play 
against Iowa with wins by the 
senior pairing of Alex Petrone 
and Michael Zhu and from the 
second pairing of Leo Hua and 
Alex Knight.

Then, the Wolverines stalled 

and entered a downward spiral, 
a sight that has become all too 
familiar for a team that cannot 
get out of its own way.

Michigan went on to lose nine 

of its next 11 combined matches 
over the course of the weekend.

In 
Iowa 
City, 
freshman 

Carter Lin and Zhu were the 
only singles wins. After getting 
shut out, 6-0, in the first set, 

Zhu came back to win the next 
two sets and the match 6-3, 7-5.

Against 
Nebraska, 
the 

Wolverines were swept, losing 
the doubles point and its first 
three singles matches. Petrone 
took junior Dusty Boyer to 
two separate tie breaks in the 
match’s first two sets, failing to 
convert on both. The day ended 
quickly, with none of the singles 
matches lasting longer than two 
sets.

“We come here to win these 

matches and find our first Big 
Ten win, but it’s disappointing,” 
said Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg. “Every match we’ve 
played except for one we’ve 
been in.”

With the losses, the team is 

still winless in conference play 
and now has just three wins 
overall.

“We just have to be a little 

better at the big moments, 
and we’re just not doing that,” 
Steinberg said.

The team, Steinberg said, 

loses all belief and makes a 
lackadaisical 
attempt 
at 
a 

comeback up until it loses.

“We have a lot of work to 

do fundamentally,” Steinberg 
said. “When things aren’t going 
well, we break down and stop 
thinking about technique and 
it becomes, ‘Oh, we’re going to 
lose again.’ I think that happens 
to a team when things just aren’t 
going well.”

Michigan needs to improve 

on the little aspects of the 
game, with sitting back on 
short balls instead of playing 
them aggressively serving as a 
principle example of one of the 
many problems it has to fix.

“You lose those matches 

and it just goes (downhill) 
fast,” Steinberg said. “We get 
into this habit of, ‘Here we go 
again.’ We’re running into each 
other.”

If there is any hope of 

salvaging the season, it will 
come in the next few weeks. 
Michigan will be playing at 
home for the majority of its 
remaining 
games. 
Taking 

advantage of a chance to focus 
on the basics, practice in a 
familiar environment and hit 
the reset button to get itself 
back on track is all the team can 
grasp onto at this point.

Wolverines fail to handle 
Maryland’s skilled offense

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s lacrosse 

team didn’t bring the right 
demolition crew to College 
Park on Sunday when it tried to 
smash through the nation’s No. 
1 defense.

It took the Wolverines nearly 

the entire 
first half to 
find 
their 

opening 
goal, as the Maryland defense 
kept them in check on the way 
to a 13-4 victory.

In addition to facing the 

nation’s top defense, junior 
specialist Brad Lott had his 
hands 
full 
taking 
faceoffs 

against the Terrapins’ senior 
midfielder Charlie Raffa, who 
ranks in the top 10 nationally in 
faceoff win percentage. Raffa 
dominated all Michigan faceoff 
men he faced, winning 11 of his 
14 draws on the day.

“There’s not really a lot you 

can do when the other team 
is dominating faceoffs,” said 
Michigan coach John Paul. “It’s 
such a tough matchup. (Raffa is) 
one of the top faceoff men in the 
country, and there’s not a magic 
pill you take and suddenly start 
winning faceoffs against top 
guys.”

Heading into the half, it 

appeared the Wolverines (0-1 
Big Ten, 4-5 overall) were still 
within arm’s reach of catching 
up to No. 3 Maryland (9-1, 
1-0). Junior midfielder Kyle 
Jackson 
netted 
Michigan’s 

opening goal with 67 seconds 
left in the half, bringing the 
Wolverines within three goals 
of the Terrapins.

Before Jackson’s goal, the 

Michigan 
offense 
looked 

completely 
incapable 
of 

breaking 
down 
Maryland’s 

solid defense, struggling to 
maintain possession and find 
a finishing touch on shooting. 
The Wolverines were especially 
vulnerable due to weak stick 

work, giving up a total of 11 
turnovers Sunday.

Michigan 
was 
without 

sophomore attacker Ian King, 
who, despite being out the last 
four games, still leads the team 
in scoring. While replacing an 
attacker as talented as King has 
been nearly impossible, Paul still 
needs the Wolverines’ starting 
attackers to pick up some of the 
slack, something they failed to 
do against Maryland.

“Our attackmen need to be 

more explosive,” Paul said. 
“They need to be challenging 
their defensemen a little more. 
Maybe that’s where (King) can 
help 
us 
in 

the 
coming 

weeks, 
but 

we still need 
some 
of 

these 
guys 

to 
step 
up 

consistently 
and 
win 

games 
and 

own that.”

On 

the other side of the field, 
Michigan’s defense absorbed 
attack after attack from a slow 
and methodical Terrapin attack. 
After conceding three goals 
in the first quarter, Michigan 
held Maryland to only one 
goal in the next period despite 
the Terrapins’ advantage in 
possession.

Six minutes into the second 

half, though, the Wolverines’ 
defense 
couldn’t 
hold 
the 

Terrapins’ attack back any 
longer. Maryland went on a 
5-0 run over the course of 
five minutes, putting itself up 
eight and crushing any hopes 
of 
a 
Michigan 
comeback. 

In the five-minute stretch, 
the Terrapins held constant 
possession 
and 
pummeled 

redshirt 
sophomore 
goalie 

Gerald Logan with quality 
shots.

The Wolverines were able 

to score three goals after 
halftime, including freshman 

midfielder Patrick Tracy’s first 
career goal. Tracy received 
extended minutes and also 
earned his first assist off of 
Jackson’s first goal.

“It 
felt 
nice 
to 
finally 

contribute to the team,” Tracy 
said. “(It) feels good to finally 
get over the hump and be able 
to help the team anyway I 
can. Personally, sticking to my 
strengths worked, especially 
with the assist.”

There was very little that 

went right for Michigan on 
Sunday, but Tracy and Jackson’s 
performances highlighted the 
Wolverines’ depth in midfield, 

which 
will 

be crucial in 
upcoming 
games.

That 
being 

said, 
defense 

was a concern 
with Michigan 
being outshot 
and 
out-

possessed. 
Maryland 

posted 20 more shots than the 
Wolverines, a stat due primarily 
to the Terrapins holding the 
ball for a majority of the game.

With the matchup against 

the 
Big 
Ten 
favorite 
in 

Maryland out of the way, 
Michigan will focus this week 
on a crucial game against 
Rutgers. With a fourth-place 
or better finish still a strong 
possibility for the Wolverines, 
they will surely refocus and 
carry forward some positives 
from Sunday.

“We talked about in the 

locker room afterward how our 
goals are still there and we still 
have incredible opportunities 
in front of us,” Paul said. “The 
guys were talking about that 
right after the game, and I 
think they understand how 
good Maryland is, but a lot of 
things have to go right to beat 
those guys, and we’re not the 
only ones who have figured 
that out.”

Pitching staff shines in 2-1 series win

Nutof, Adcock, 

Cronenworth start 
as Wolverines beat 

Maryland twice

By BEN FIDELMAN

Daily Sports Writer

After being outscored 25-7 

in its Big Ten opening series 
against Nebraska last weekend, 
the Michigan baseball pitching 
staff was in need of a serious 
lift. The climb from an 0-3 start 
in conference play could have 
become an even tougher task 
with the team heading into a 
three-game set against No. 20 
Maryland (4-2 Big Ten, 18-7 
overall) this weekend at Ray 
Fisher Stadium.

But the pitching staff as a 

whole would came through on 
the weekend, allowing just six 
runs to one of the best offenses 
in the nation.

“It was huge coming off a 

tough weekend, we needed to get 
something going in Big Ten play 
moving forward,” said freshman 
right-hander Ryan Nutof. “We 
were kind of embarrassed after 
last weekend. We had a meeting 
and figured out who we were (as 
a pitching staff).”

Looking like somewhat of 

a rag-tag group, the starting 
rotation is beginning to rebound 
from injuries and recent poor 
performances. This weekend, 
junior 
right-hander 
Jacob 

Cronenworth, 
Nutof 
and 

sophomore 
left-hander 
Brett 

Adcock went to the mound for 
the Wolverines (2-4, 14-12).

So far this season, Nutof has 

been the only one of the three 
with a reliable track record as a 
starting pitcher, carrying a 2.92 
earned-run 
average 
through 

seven starts.

Cronenworth 
took 
the 

mound for the Wolverines in 
the first game of the series on 
Saturday afternoon. Though 

he’s usually the team’s closer, 
he put together a solid outing 
in a losing effort, as Michigan 
dropped 
the 
game, 
3-1. 

Allowing just two runs over five 
innings of work, Cronenworth 
put Michigan in a position to 
take an early victory and defeat 
Maryland’s Mike Shawaryn, 
one of the best pitchers in the 
conference.

“(Cronenworth) is a guy that’s 

going to attack the zone with 
a lot of quality pitches,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“He’s tough on the mound and 
gives us a chance. He’s dominant 
in the closer role, and we didn’t 
even get to him last weekend. 
In our current state, he can 
best serve us in the starter role. 
He gave us five decent innings 
(Saturday).”

Though there was a lack of 

run support in the first game, 
the Wolverine offense had no 
problem putting the team on top 
for the rest of the weekend. That 
offensive effort, paired with 
stellar pitching, led Michigan to 
take two of the weekend’s three 
games.

In the second game of the 

series, Nutof was dominant 
through 7.1 shutout innings, 
allowing just five hits on the 
afternoon. 
He 
would 
have 

continued 
further 
into 
the 

game, but he was taken out 
for 
precautionary 
reasons 

when he started feeling chest 
discomfort.

The Michigan starter with 

the lowest ERA in the 2014 
campaign was Adcock, who 
ended the season with at 2.87. 
His numbers this season have 
been far from consistent with 
that, but this weekend he put 
together a start that could prove 
to be a turning point for his 
season.

After loading the bases in 

the first inning, Adcock was 
on the receiving end of a stern 
mound visit from Bakich, and 
he responded by striking out the 
side to neutralize the Terrapin 

threat. He ended up allowing 
just two runs in four innings 
pitched, which, combined with 
four innings in relief from 
freshman right-hander Jayce 
Vancena, was good enough to 
lead the Wolverines to victory.

Looking forward to the rest 

of the Michigan season on the 
mound, the team awaits the 
return of junior left-hander 
Evan 
Hill 
and 
sophomore 

right-hander Keith Lehmann 
from injuries. Both players had 
major roles for the Wolverines 
in last year’s rotation and could 
provide 
some 
much-needed 

depth for Michigan as it moves 
into the heart of its season.

“(Hill) is going to be back 

sooner than later,” Bakich said. 
“I know he’s very anxious to 
get back on the mound, and 
the team is looking forward to 
getting him back out there. If 

there’s one area that you don’t 
want to be thin in, it’s pitching. 
With a couple of other guys 
that are out right now from the 
mound, getting everyone back to 
full strength will be big for this 
club.”

Bakich expects both Hill and 

Lehmann to be back in the next 
few weeks.

The 
coaching 
staff 

compensated for those injuries 
by moving Cronenworth into 
the rotation. Neither he or 
Bakich knows how long a 
starting role will be his, but both 
said that next Friday at Indiana 
will be another situation where 
Cronenworth will be used to 
begin the game.

“Moving Cronenworth to the 

starting role certainly gave us 
a boost,” Bakich said. “Really, 
we feel comfortable doing that 
because we feel good about 

(freshman right-hander) Bryan 
Pall at the end of the game. We 
start multiple guys and try to 
keep it simple with them by 
telling them to attack the zone 
with quality pitches and let your 
defense work behind you. When 
we’ve done that, the results have 
been very positive.”

Michigan faces three of the 

projected top teams in the 
conference in the beginning 
of the season in Nebraska, 
Maryland 
and 
Indiana, 
so 

weathering that portion of the 
schedule 
with 
a 
banged-up 

pitching staff has been key for 
the Wolverines so far. Sitting 
with four conference losses 
through six games isn’t ideal, 
but Bakich believes if the staff 
can keep stringing quality starts 
together, Michigan will be a 
serious contender in the Big 
Ten.

Wolverines falter 
in late loss to Iowa

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

The weight of the weekend 

was finally bearing down on 
sophomore right-hander Megan 
Betsa’s shoulders.

For the first time in an 

otherwise dominant weekend, 
Betsa was struggling. She was 
missing the strike zone. She didn’t 
seem so eager to put her foot back 
on the rubber. The snow started 
to fall, the fatigue started to show 
and the game was slipping out of 
the Wolverines’ grasp.

The Michigan softball team 

(5-1 Big Ten, 31-5 overall) fell 6-4 
to Iowa in the final game of its Big 
Ten home-opening series.

After establishing an early lead, 

the fourth-ranked Wolverines 
collapsed in the top of the sixth 
inning, as the Hawkeyes (2-6, 
11-26) finally cracked the pitching 
code of sophomore right-hander 
Megan Betsa.

“When you pitch (15.1) innings 

in a weekend, you’re going to 
get tired,” Betsa said. “They did 
a good job making adjustments 
to my pitching and that’s a 
compliment to them. But when 
they make adjustments, I need to 
make adjustments too, and I just 
didn’t do that (well enough).”

Through five innings, Betsa 

allowed no runs and recorded 
11 strikeouts. But when Betsa 
walked shortstop Megan Blank, 
the wheels began to fall off 
Michigan’s pitching carousel.

Iowa catcher Holly Hoffman 

worked an 11-pitch at-bat, and 
sent the final pitch to the plate 
over the left-centerfield wall. 
Right fielder Allie Wood followed 
up with a solo shot of her own 
to left field to make it 4-3, with 
Michigan still leading.

Though Betsa got out of the jam 

with two strikeouts, the worst was 
yet to come for the Wolverines.

Michigan failed to record 

a single hit in the bottom of 
the sixth, and the Hawkeyes 
capitalized 
in 
the 
following 

inning. Betsa put two runners on 

base and was replaced by senior 
left-hander Haylie Wagner.

But things didn’t improve after 

the change in the circle.

Runners 
advanced 
on 
a 

wild pitch by Wagner, and she 
proceeded to intentionally walk 
Hoffman on the next at-bat to 
load the bases. Iowa first baseman 
Kaitlyn Mullarkey stepped to 
the plate and laced a hit down 
the first-base line, scoring two 
runs to put the Hawkeyes up 5-4. 
Wood then drove in another run 
with a groundout.

After the three-run seventh 

inning, the Wolverines failed 
to recover as they hit into a 
double play and grounded out to 
shortstop to end the game.

The silver lining of Michigan’s 

loss was sophomore left fielder 
Kelly 
Christner’s 
consistent 

performance at the plate. In the 
bottom of the first inning, junior 

centerfielder Sierra Lawrence 
was hit by a pitch, and on the 
following 
at-bat, 
Christner 

tattooed a 2-1 pitch out of the 
park to left-center field.

After the first inning surge, 

Michigan struggled to put runs 
on the board, only posting one 
run in the third against Iowa 
right-hander Shayla Starkenburg.

“When we’re on it seems 

easy,” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “But when we’re not 
all on we still have to find ways 
to win and to compete better. We 
squandered too many at-bats. We 
got what we deserved.”

It should have been an easy 

sweep. Betsa’s 35 strikeouts on 
the weekend should have been 
enough. But after being leaned 
upon all weekend, Betsa was 
bound to fall eventually.

And the Wolverines paid a 

large price when that time came.

Sophomore right-hander Megan Betsa pitched 15.1 innings in three games, striking out 35 batters and picking up two wins before losing the series finale.

‘M’ regains leader in Sweet

By TYLER SCOTT

Daily Sports Writer

Senior catcher Lauren Sweet 

was standing on second base 
when 
freshman 
designated 

player Aidan Falk ripped a single 
through the right side of the 
infield March 14 in the Michigan 
softball team’s matchup with 
Kent State. Sweet rounded third 
and bolted for home, but as she 
slid into home, her right foot 
was trapped under her body at 
a plainly unnatural angle. The 
run scored, but the damage was 
done. The fans at Alumni Field 
held their collective breath until 
Sweet was helped off the field in 
a fireman’s carry.

But 
Saturday, 
Sweet 
was 

substituted in as a pinch-hitter 
for the Wolverines in the fifth 
inning. When she stepped into 
the batter’s box for the first time 
since recovering from her injury, 
the fans roared.

“Being out for a week and a 

half is pretty tough, and I’ve 
really been struggling with it,” 
Sweet said. “(The cheers) were 

like a spark for me to work even 
harder to get back as well, it was 
awesome.”

Michigan 
faced 
a 

disappointing loss on Sunday 
to go 2-1 against Iowa on the 
weekend. If Saturday’s brief 
in-game appearance had been 
a test of Sweet’s health, she 
passed. 
When 
the 
starting 

lineup was announced prior to 
Sunday’s loss, Sweet’s name was 
on the list. She was back at her 
familiar post behind home plate 
for the first pitch.

“It’s a lot of ups and downs — 

I think it’s hard to say exactly 
where I’m at,” Sweet said. “I 
want to be out there, so I’m going 
to work as hard as I can to be out 
there whenever I can.”

It wasn’t obvious at first that 

she was comfortable being back. 
Sophomore right-hander Megan 
Betsa’s first pitch slipped out of 
Sweet’s glove. It happened again 
for the second batter. It had been 
15 days since Sweet had last 
experienced live pitching in a 
game, so maybe a little rust was 
to be expected.

But by the second inning, 

Sweet had settled in, comfortable 
in resuming her long tenure as 
Michigan’s catcher. Her role is 
about more than just technical 
expertise. She’s the watchman 
for the pitching staff — a source 
of calm and positivity when 
tension runs high.

“I expect her to take control of 

the pitchers, that’s her job,” said 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins. 
“I think she’s very good at it, 
and we’ve needed her back. It’s 
unfortunate (that) for her first 
good start back we didn’t get it 
done.”

The 
Hawkeyes 
overcame 

a four-run Michigan lead by 
scoring three runs in the sixth 
and seventh innings to upset 
the Wolverines. But throughout 
the final frames, whether it was 
when sophomore right-hander 
Megan 
Betsa 
was 
fighting 

fatigue, or when senior left-
hander Haylie Wagner found 
herself in a bases-loaded jam, 
Sweet was there to walk out 
to the circle and steady her 
pitchers.

“Most of the time it’s just to 

calm down,” Sweet said. “No 
matter what happens, I need 
to be positive, and I need to be 
giving them all the energy I 
have. No matter what happens, 
I’m there for them.”

There was no demand on 

Sweet to make plays at the 
plate, no chances to try and 
gun down an attempted steal. 
Despite taking the 6-4 loss to 
Iowa, perhaps it was the perfect 
scenario for Sweet to ease herself 
back into her starting role.

Before her injury, Sweet was 

batting .324 with six home runs 
and 28 RBI. though resuming 
that productivity may not come 
as easily for Sweet as fulfilling 
her duties as catcher.

“She’s a big bat in our lineup, 

but I didn’t think her bat looked 
very good,” Hutchins said. “She’s 
going to have to work hard this 
week to swing better.”

But her fans and teammates 

will still be there to cheer her 
on when she’s up at bat. Perhaps 
it’s a poetic twist of fate that 
now Sweet will be reaping the 
benefits of a positive approach 
she champions.
