'U' professors:
Occupy Wall
Street may not
have big impact

* Occupy Ann Arbor
to hold protest on
Diag tonight
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The Occupy Wall Street
movement that originated in
New York is spreading quickly
across the nation and the state
of Michigan, but according to
University experts on political
and economic reformation, the
protests may not have much of
an impact.
The protests, which began in
Manhattan's Financial District
on Sept. 17, have spurred move-
ments in the state of Michigan,
such as the Occupy Michigan,
Occupy Southeast Michigan and
Occupy Ann Arbor. The momen-
tum from the demonstrators
has the potential to convince
politicians to heed the protest-
ers' calls for economic equality,
but the outcome may not be as
favorable as supports of Occupy
Wall Street and its counterparts
hope.
Since the start of Occupy Wall

Street, numerous people have
been arrested, including 700
protesters who marched across
the Brooklyn Bridge on Satur-
day. Yesterday, union members
protested in Manhattan and
hundreds of college students
across New York participated in
class walkouts.
As of 10 p.m. yesterday, the
Occupy Southeast Michigan
Facebook page had 269 "likes,"
Occupy Ann Arbor had 787
"likes," and Occupy Michigan
had 3,677 "likes." Occupy Ann
Arbor, which aims to support
the other Occupy groups across
the nation, is planning to host
a "general assembly" event
tonight on the Diag to bring
together resources of the local
community, spread informa-
tion about what people can do to
support economic equality and
show solidarity.
Law School Prof. Michael
Barr, who helped write the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
Consumer Protection Act,
which was signed into law on
July 21, 2010 to protect consum-

'U' t invest $25M in,
startups in next 10 yrs.

Faculty businesses
with capital to get
up to $500,000
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
University President Mary
Sue Coleman announced two
new major initiatives aimed at
strengthening the University as
it moves toward its bicentennial
in her annual address to campus

yesterday morning.
Speaking from the Colloqui-
um of the Ross School of Busi-
ness, Coleman told the audience
of mostly University adminis-
trators that the University wit,
launch a new program, Michigan
Investment in New Technology
Startups, which will invest up to
$25 million in University startup
businesses over the next decade.
Through the MINTS pro-
gram, the University will pro-
vide up to $500,000 to any
faculty member whose startup

business has already secured an
initial source of capital. Coleman
said the University is making a
"passive investment" because it
won't pick winners and losers.
Rather, it will provide funding to
any startup that meets the eligi-
bility criteria.
Funding for MINTS will come
from the University endowment.
Coleman said the new invest-
ments will allow the Univer-
sity to add some variation to its
investment portfolio.
"Now I want to be clear: This

is not a new expense on the part
of the University," Coleman said.
"Rather, we are diversifying our
assets."
Coleman said University offi-
cials looked at investments that
could have been made in the last
20 years and decided the endeav-
or would be advantageous. She
said one of the best aspects of
the new initiative is that it will
generate economic activity in
Michigan.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HEALTH SYSTEM
UMHS planning to double
number of complex care cases

Goal is to increase
statewide cases from
7 to 15 percent
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
Daily StaffReporter
When Ora Pescovitz joined
the University of Michigan
Health System in 2009, she envi-
sioned having a team that would
make new discoveries and shape
the future of health care.

Two years later, Pescovitz, the
executive vice president for med-
ical affairs, is outlining her goals
to achieve this vision.
At the annual State of the
Health System address last
week, Pescovitz challenged her
staff to double its share of com-
plex care cases like heart bypass
surgeries before the close of the
decade. Pescovitz plans for her
staff to achieve this by increasing
patient referrals and looking for
partners to share resourceswith.
"It isn't enough to do a lot

of things well," Pescovitz said
before an auditorium of UMHS
staff. "We need to do some things
better than anyone else."
UMHS handles about 7 per-
cent of complex care cases
statewide and tends to about
45,000 inpatient stays each year.
Increasing complex care cases
to 15 percent will help UMHS
gain "market leadership" and
maintain financial stability in
its hospitals and health centers,
Pescovitz said in her speech.

Profs. Anne
McNeil, Christiane
Jablonowski to get
five-yeat, grants
By SABIRA KHAN
Daily StaffReporter
Instead of teaching classes
today, two University professors
will travel to Washington, D.C.
to receive presidential awards for
their achievements in science.

Anne McNeil, an assistant pro-
fessor of chemistry, and Chris-
tiane Jablonowski, an assistant
professorofatmospheric,oceanic
and space sciences in the College
of Engineering, were among 94
scientists selected to receive the
Presidential Early Career Award
for Scientists and Engineers for
their work in structure-property
relationships and climate model-
ing, respectively.
The award was commissioned
by former President Bill Clinton
to honor the achievements of
young science professionals in

their independent. Nominees are
selected by government agen-
cies, and winners receive a five-
year grant to put toward their
research.
McNeil and Jablonowski were
nominated for the award by the
U.S. Department of Energy in
April. Jablonowski said it is a
very competitive award because
the DOE nominees have a 2 to 3
percent chance of receiving it.
McNeil wrote in an e-mail
interview that she was original-

Hundreds of e-mails spam
students on 'U' listserv

Initial e-mail asks
students to sign
petition for Jay-Z,
Kanye West concert
By CAITLIN HUSTON and
JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
DailyNewsEditors
Students repeatedly hit the
delete button in their inboxes last
night, as an e-mail advocating to
sign a petition for Kanye West
and Jay-Z to play at the Big House
turned into a hodgepodge of pro-
fane replies and pleas for an end to
the spamming.
LSA senior Joe Linden sent the
initial e-mail at about 10 p.m. last
night to the W11StudentULWR
listserv, with a link to the petition
that calls for rap artists West and
Jay-Z to perform at halftime of
the Michigan-Ohio State football
game on Nov. 26 - the same day
the pair is scheduled to perform
a concert at the Palace of Auburn
Hills.

The listserv includes all stu-
dents who took courses that ful-
filled the Upper-Level writing
requirement in the College of Lit-
erature, Science and Arts.
The original e-mail multiplied
into hundreds of e-mails as many
students replied all and directly
to Linden, causing every student
on the listserv to receive the
requests.
In an interview at about 1:10
a.m., Linden said he received
mixed responses from students.
He said some thanked him for
the entertainment, while others
threatened him. Still, he said he
was surprised that the situation
accelerated so quickly.
"I was astonished, very aston-
ished," Linden said.
Linden is the co-president of
New Beat Happening - a group
in the University's Division of
Student Affairs that puts on con-
certs in the University Unions. He
said he is advocating for West and
Jay-Z to come to campus in part
because he has experience bring-
ingtour groups to campus.
The listserv was shutdown at

about 12:45 a.m. A representative
of the University's Information
and Technology Services declined
to comment about the situation
when contacted by The Michigan
Daily early this morning.
But not all of the e-mails sent
in response to Linden's initial
message were from angry and
annoyed students. Some students
took advantage of the opportu-
nity to promote social causes and
connect with friends. One student
even asked others on the listserv if
they wanted to go to Rick's Amer-
ican Caf.
Engineering junior Trent Hib-
bard wrote in an e-mail interview
that he was not angry about the
spamming and thought it was a
nice surprise.
"It was a fun accident that led
to thousands of students engag-
ing in meaningless conversation
with each other," Hibbard wrote.
"I don't see it as a bad thing at all."
LSA senior Peter Feng wrote in
an e-mail interview that he also
found the incident entertaining
and "a great way to procrasti-
nate."

Republicans request change
in state electoral vote system

Changes likely
to hurt Obama's
re-election chances
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -
Republicans in Pennsylvania and
Nebraska want to change the way
their states award Electoral Col-
legevotes, moves thatcould hinder
President Barack Obama's re-elec-
tion chances.
Lawmakers in the Democratic-
leaning battleground of Pennsyl-
vania are weighing whether to
give the presidential nominees one
electoral vote for each congressio-
nal district they win, rather than

giving all its votes to the candidate
who wins the state's popular vote,
like Obama did in 2008.
In GOP-tilting Nebraska, law-
makers want to go to a winner-
take-all system four years after
Obama won the 2nd Congressional
District and its single electoral col-
lege vote.
It takes 270 Electoral College
votes to win the presidency out of
538 up for grabs. Every vote mat-
ters in a close election and every
sign points to a competitive 2012
race as an incumbent Demo-
cratic president who most people
still personally like tries to win a
second term in tough economic
times.

"Any electoral vote is important
in these elections," said Michael
Mezey, a professor of political
science at DePaul University in
Chicago. "When you start dealing
with large states, it can make a dif-
ference. And also you're not just
dealing with Pennsylvania; other
states may follow suit."
The changes Republicans in
Pennsylvania and Nebraska are
trying to make likely would give
the eventual GOP nominee an
advantage by shifting the voting
power from more liberal, predomi-
nantly Democratic cities in both
states, to more conservative rural
and suburban areas that tend to
favor Republicans.

Innovator
revolutionized
world of technology
CUPERTINO, California (AP)
- Steve Jobs, the Apple founder
and former CEO who invented
and masterfully marketed ever-
sleeker gadgets that transformed
everyday technology, from the
personal computer to the iPod
and ighone, died yesterday. He
was 56.
Apple announced his death
without giving a specific cause.
He died peacefully, according to
a statement from family mem-
bers who said they were present.
"Steve's brilliance, passion and
energy were the source of count-
less innovations that enrich and
improve all of our lives," Apple's
board said in a statement. "The
world is immeasurably better
because of Steve"
Jobs had battled cancer in
2004 and underwent a liver
transplant in 2009 after taking a
leave of absence for unspecified
health problems. He took another
leave of absence in January - his
third since his health problems

began - and officially resigned
in August. He took another leave
of absence in January - his third
since his health problems began
- before resigning as CEO six
weeks ago. Jobs became Apple's
chairman and handed the CEO
job over to his hand-picked suc-
cessor, Tim Cook.
Outside Apple's Cupertino
headquarters, three flags - an
American flag, a California state
flag and an Apple flag - were fly-
ing at half-staff late yesterday.
"Those of us viho have been
fortunate enough to know and
work with Steve have lost a dear
friend and an inspiring men-
tor." Cook wrote in an email to
Apple's employees. "Steve leaves
behind a company that only he
could have built, and his spirit
will forever be the foundation of
Apple."
The news Apple fans and
shareholders had been dread-
ing came the day after Apple
unveiled its latest version of the
Phone, just one in a procession
of devices that shaped technol-
ogy and society while Jobs was
running the company.
Jobs started Apple with a high
school friend in a Silicon Valley

garage in 1976, was forced out a
decade later and returned in 1997
to rescue the company. During
his second stint, it grew into the
most valuable technology com-
pany in the world with a mar-
ket value of $351 billion. Almost
all that wealth has been created
since Jobs' return.
Cultivating Apple's counter-
cultural sensibility and a mini-
malist design ethic, Jobs rolled
out one sensational product after
another, even in the face of the
late-2000s recession and his own
failing health.
He helped change computers
from a geeky hobbyist's obses-
sion to a necessity of modern
life at work and home, and in
the process he upended not just
personal technology but the cell-
phone and music industries.
For transformation of Ameri-
can industry, he has few rivals
He has long been linked to his
personal computer-age contem-
porary, Bill Gates, and has drawn
comparisons to other creative
geniuses such as Walt Disney.
Jobs died as Walt Disney Co.'s
largest shareholder, a by-product
of his decision to sell computer
animation studio Pixar in 2006.

DETROIT
State receives
$196.5M grant for
high-speed rail
A high-speed passenger train
service between Chicago and
Detroit has taken two big steps
forward with a $196.5 million
federal grant to Michigan and the
state's $140 million acquisition of
a 135-mile stretch of track.
The U.S. Department of Trans-
portation announced yesterday
that it has awarded Michigan
the funds for signal and track
improvements on the rail line
between Kalamazoo in western
Michigan and Dearborn in subur-
ban Detroit.
Also yesterday, the state said
that it has agreed to buy the tracks
between the two cities from Nor-
folk Southern Railway for $140
million.
The purchase money comes
from the U.S. Transportation
Department's Federal Railroad
Administration, also the fund-
ing source for the track improve-
ments.

Conservationists
sue Canadian
pipeline company
U.S. officials illegally allowed a
Canadian company to begin pre-
paring the route for its proposed
1,700-mile-long oil pipeline from
western Canada to Texas, even
though the project hasn't gained
final government approval, three
conservationist groups contend in
a lawsuit filed yesterday.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service should not have allowed
TransCanada Corp. to begin
clearing a 100-mile corridor
through northern Nebraska
grasslands because the State
Department hasn't signed off on
the Keystone XL pipeline project,
the groups argue in their lawsuit
filed in federal court in Omaha.
TransCanada was allowed to
mow down delicate native grasses
and to relocate an endangered
species living there, the American
burying beetle, they say.
WASHINGTON
Senate Democrats
add millionaire
tax to jobs bill
Struggling to deliver the big
jobs package proposed by Presi-
dent Barack Obama, Senate Dem-
ocrats are using the issue to force
Republicansenatorstovote ontax
increases for millionaires, picking
up on a White House theme that
the nation's wealthiest Americans
aren't paying their fair share.
Senate Democrats said yester-
day they were changing Obama's
jobs package to add a 5.6 percent
tax on income above $1 million, a
proposal that is sure to be blocked
by Republicans.
The $447 billion package still

includes Obama's proposals to cut
payroll taxes and provide money
for teachers, firefighters, the
unemployed and infrastructure.
The tax on millionaires is expect-
ed to pay for the package, so it
wouldn't add to the budget deficit.

Police capture one

cartel's last leaders
Mexican police say they have
captured one of the last major
leaders of the La Familia cartel, a
pseudo-religious drug gang that
has been decimated by arrests
and killings.
The head of the federal police
anti-drug unit says suspect Mar-
tin Rosales Magana was trying to
forge an alliance with the Zetas
cartel to revive La Familia.
Federal Police Commissioner
Facundo Rosas says La Familia
has been almost completely disar-

The cartel has been displaced
in its western home state of
Michoacan by the equally cult-
like Knights Templar gang.

of San Jose began after authori-
ties said he opened fire at a rou-
tine safetymeetingat Permanente
Quarry around 4:15 a.m. and later
wounded a woman in a failed car-
jacking.
Schools were closed or on lock-
down in Cupertino, home of Apple
Inc., and in neighboring commu-
nities as authorities went door to
door with guns drawn and resi-
dents were warned to stayindoors.
Meanwhile, friends and neigh-
bors expressed disbelief and sad-
ness at the possibility the man
theyknew as an outgoing, engaged
member of the community could
have committed such horrific acts
of violence.
Allman became upset and left
the meeting then returned with
a handgun and rifle and started
shooting people, Santa Clara
County sheriff's Lt. Rick Sung
said. About 15 workers were at
the meeting during the shoot-
ing, which authorities said lasted
about two minutes.
Sheriff Laurie Smith said two
people were pronounced dead at
Permanente Quarry in the foot-

hills outside Cupertino, and a
third person died later at a hospi-
tal.
Six others at the quarry were
wounded and taken to hospitals,
where some remained in critical
condition, Smith said.
The names of the victims have
not been released.
Relatives of victims and other
employees rushed to the quarry
to check on their loved ones. One
woman, who asked to remain
anonymous because the gunman
was still at large, said her father
worked at the quarry for about 10
years and was the lead employee
on the night shift.
She said he called his family
around 4:30 a.m. to say something
was happening and not to pick
him up. He called again just after
6 a.m. to say he was OK but was
hiding.
He called a third time to say he
was coming out of hiding.
Later in the day, authorities
located Allman's vehicle and
seized a shotgun, a handgun and
two rifles believed to belongto the
suspect, Smith said, adding that
some of the weapons were found
in the car.
"The challenges are the big
geographical area," she said of
the manhunt. "The challenges are
that he's armed."
Around 7 a.m., authorities
received a 911 call that a woman
was shot in an attempted car-
jacking near Hewlett-Packard
Co.'s Cupertino campus by a
man matching Allman's descrip-
tion. The shooter fled on foot
after using a weapon similar to a
gun used in the quarry shooting,
authorities said.

Suicide bomber
kills 72, injuries
100 in attack
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)
- Al-Qaida-linked militants
threatened more terror attacks
that will "increase day by day"
after a suicide bomber killed 72
people. Mourners transported
coffins atop cars yesterday to
funerals for those who perished
in al-Shabab's deadliest bomb
attack in Somalia.
A truck loaded with drums
of fuel exploded Tuesday at the
gate of a building housing several
government ministries in a busy
street in the capital where tens
of thousands of famine victims
have fled. The attack came more
than a month after most al-Sha-
bab fighters melted away from
Mogadishu amid a pro-govern-
ment offensive, and showed that
the insurgents remain a severe
threat.
"At this time, when the coun-
try is in the midst of a worsening
humanitarian crisis, the terror-
ists could not have attacked the
Somali people at a worst time,"
Information Minister Abdulka-

dir Hussein Mohamed said.
Al-Shabab spokesman Ali
Mohamud Rage identified the
suicide bomber as Somali stu-
dent Bashar Abdullahi Nur. He
said the attack was a warning
to those who thought the group
had left Mogadishu for good in
August.
"We wish to inform the Mus-
lim people that the campaign
against infidels will be back-
to-back and by God's grace will
increase day by day and will
increase in the coming hours,"
Rage said. "I will give a good tid-
ing to the infidels: You will face
big and broad blows."
In a prerecorded farewell
interview with al-Shabab radio
station, the bomber said: "It will
be a big blow to the heart of the
enemy."
Tuesday's thunderous blast
covered the city in dust more
than a half-mile (800 meters)
away and left blackened corpses
sprawled amid burning vehicles
and dozens wounded. Soma-
lia's Ministry of Health said in
a statement yesterday that 72
people had been killed and more
than 100 were wounded, includ-
ing 38 still in serious condition.
"May Allah put them in hell,"

one Somali woman sobbed as
a young man tried to comfort
her. She then collapsed near the
coffin of her dead son that was
placed by a sandy grave.
Sadiya Omar, who lost her
husband in Tuesday's bomb-
ing, left the scene of the funeral
before he was interred, saying it
was more than she could bear.
"The world will get no peace
while killers like al-Shabab are
still here," she cried, her tears
dripping through her black veil.
President Sheik Sharif Sheik
Ahmed declared three days of
mourning and vowed late Tues-
day that his government would
put in place security measures to
avert future bombings.
"I'm sure the crime they com-
mitted against the Somali people
will not go unpunished," Ahmed
said of the al-Shabab militants.
"God will punish them and the
government will take appropri-
ate measures to save the Somali
people from those dangers."
However, Ahmed's govern-
ment does not have sufficient
troops or police to secure the
capital city, and neither does the
more than 9,000 strong African
Union peacekeeping force that
supports his regime.

Germany reopens probes on
hundreds of Nazi camp guards

Investigators
believe fewer than
1,000 suspects are
still alive
BERLIN (AP) - In a final
quest to bring Holocaust partici-
pants to justice, German author-
ities have reopened hundreds of
dormant investigations of Nazi
death camp guards - men who
are now so old that time has
become "the enemy" for prose-
cutors hurrying to prepare cases.
The efforts could result in
new prosecutions nearly seven
decades after World War IL
Special Nazi war-crimes
investigators reopened the files
after the conviction of former
U.S. autoworker John Demjan-
juk, whose case set a new legal
precedent in Germany. It was
the first time prosecutors had
been able to convict someone in
a Nazi-era case without direct
evidence that the suspect par-
ticipated ina specific killing.
Now authorities are weigh-
ing whether the same approach
could be used to pursue others,
said Kurt Schrimm, the prosecu-
tor who heads the investigation
unit.
Given the advanced age of
the suspects, investigators are
not waiting until Demjanjuk's
appeals are decided.
"We don't want to wait too
long, so we've already begun our
investigations," Schrimm said.
Elan Steinberg, vice president
of the American Gathering of
Holocaust Survivors and their
Descendants, welcomed the
news and urged prosecutors to
act quickly.

"As our numbers - those of
the victims - have also rapidly
dwindled, this represents the
final opportunity to witness jus-
tice carried out in our lifetimes,"
he said. "Time is the enemy
here."
Meanwhile, the Simon Wie-
senthal Center's top Nazi-hunt-
er, Efraim Zuroff, said he would
also launch a new campaign in
the next two months to track
down remaining Nazi war crim-
inals. He said the Demjanjuk
conviction has opened the door
to prosecutionshe never thought
possible before.
"It could be a very interesting
final chapter," he said by phone
from Jerusalem. "This has tre-
mendous implications even at
this late date."
Demjanjuk, now 91, was
deported from the U.S. to Ger-
many in 2009 to stand trial. He
was convicted in May of 28,060
counts of accessory to murder
for serving as a guard at the
Sobibor death camp in Nazi-
occupied Poland.
Munich prosecutors argued
that if they could prove that he
was a guard at a camp like Sobi-
bor - established for the sole
purpose of extermination - it
was enough to convict him of
accessory to murder.
After 18 months of testimony,
a Munich court agreed, finding
Demjanjuk guilty and sentenc-
ing him to five years in prison.
He denies ever being a guard
and is currently free in southern
Germany while appealing the
conviction.
Schrimm said his office is
going over all its files to see if
any other cases fit into the same
category as Demjanjuk. He esti-
mated there are probably fewer

than 1,000 possible suspects in
Germany and abroad who are
alive and can still be prosecuted.
He would notgive any names.
"We have to check everything
- from the people who we were
aware of in camps like Sobibor ...
or also in the Einsatzgruppen,"
he said, referring to the death
squads responsible for mass
killings, particularly early in
the war before the death camps
were established.
Prosecutors have not yet
tested whether the Demjanjuk
precedent could be extended to
guards of Nazi camps where the
sole purpose was not necessarily
murder but where thousands of
people died anyway.
Even the narrowest scenario
- looking at the guards of the
four death camps used only for
killings: Belzec, Sobibor, Chelm-
no and Treblinka - plus those
involved in the Einsatzgruppen
could lead to scores more pros-
ecutions, Zuroff said.
He estimated the number of
suspects at 4,000.
"Even ifonly 2percent of those
people are alive, we're talking80
people. And let's assume half of
them are not medically fit to be
brought to justice. That leaves
us with 40 people, so there is
incredible potential," he said.
Immediately after the war,
top Nazis such as Hermann
Goering were convicted at trials
run by the Allies.
Investigations of the lower
ranks eventually fell to German
courts. But there was little polit-
ical will to aggressively pursue
the prosecutions, and many of
the trials ended with short sen-
tences or acquittals of suspects
in positions of greater responsi-
bility than Demjanjuk.

Mayor asks all city
employees to take
wage reductions
DEARBORN HEIGHTS, Mich.
(AP) - Dearborn Heights has
gone to a four-day workweek at
its municipal offices in a cost-
cutting move meant to help it deal
with a projected $5 million bud-
get shortfall.
The city started shutting
municipal offices on Fridays last
month, joining several communi-
ties that went to a four-day sched-
ule in recent years, including
Hazel Park, Wixom and Bloom-
field and Oakland townships,
The Detroit News reported. The
Detroit suburbs of Ferndale and
Clawson also use a four-day
workweek.
In exchange, communities
are boosting online services
and working to improve effi-
ciency as they try to deal with
the streamlined hours. William
Matthewson, general counsel for
the Michigan Municipal League,
noted that everything can't be
accomplished online.
"There's an intangible benefit
to having a city or a village

hall. It's a focal point of a com-
munity as well as being a service
center," he said. "Perhaps we are
moving to a virtual city hall. But
at the same time, the reduction of
hours means that a lot of citizens
don'thavethesamelevel of access
to their community's expertise."
Dearborn Heights Mayor Dan
Paletko said the city is asking all
218 employees to take a 10 percent
wage reduction to save the city
$1.3 million. He said that about
115 workers agreed to Friday fur-
loughs to meet that goal. The city
faces a predicted $5 million bud-
get shortfall.
The city hopes to streamline
operations to save an additional
$1 million and will ask voters in
November to approve an overall
$3.5 million tax increase.
"Do we like doing this? Abso-
lutely not, but given the dire eco-
nomic situation we really didn't
have a choice," Paletko said. "The
financing model for cities, town-
ships and county government in
Michigan is completely broken."
JeffGootee, president ofAFSC-
ME Local 290, which represents
about 50 employees affected by
the furloughs, said the workers
know the cut was necessary but
are fearful of its impact.

Restricting democracy
Laws shouldn't keep voters from the polls
Big changes could be coming to the polls for the 2012 elections,
worrying both voters and politicians alike. In what is being
touted as an effort to prevent voting fraud, many states have
recently passed laws that require voters to present government-issued
photo identification at polls. Some states have also enacted laws that
shorten early voting periods and restrict timing of voter registration
drives. There is little evidence these policies would have an effect on
curbing voter fraud in the United States, and these laws are likely to
only stop eligible people from voting.

A tale of two students

The Brennan Center for Justice at the
New York University School of Law released
a study this week that analyzed 19 laws and
two executive orders pertaining to voter
identification in 14 states. The study suggests
that voting could become more difficult for
more than 5 million eligible voters in 2012
under the new laws, and the number of states
adopting new voting policies is rising.
According to the study, five states passed
laws seeking to decrease the number of
opportunities voters have to cast their ballot
before Election Day. This disregards the fact
that some churches organize voting drives on
Sundays prior to the standard Tuesday Elec-
tion Day to encourage members of their con-
gregations to cast their ballots. Maine and
Ohio no longer permit voters to register on
Election Day, even though about 60,000 new
voters registered in Maine on Election Day
in 2008. In response, residents in Maine and
Ohio are lookingto overturn these laws.
The biggest concern is that these laws
could potentially prevent minorities, young
people and the poor from voting. While some
politicians have claimed the new laws are
necessary to prevent voter fraud, they cite
little evidence to prove incidents of fraud

would decrease.
Americans struggle to get to the polls
with the current regulations in place. The
2008 election broke voting records with a 64
percent voter turnout and 130 million votes
cast. If one of the most polarizing elections
in recent history can't even get two-thirds of
eligible voters to the polls, then making the
process even more challenging could serious-
ly reduce the number of ballots cast in 2012.
While states have ensured they will pro-
vide free identification cards if the laws
are passed, the likelihood that all voters
who need them will seek them out is slim.
Instead, these people - an estimated 3.2 mil-
lion eligible voters - will most likely decide
not to vote. If the U.S. is to function as a true
democracy, where all eligible voters are rea-
sonably able to vote, then these laws should
not be passed.
The investigation into fraudulent voting
should continue and states should take rea-
sonable measures to address any problems
they may discover. However, if these laws
are simply an effort to deter certain voters
from heading to the polls, then they should
be repealed immediately and prevented from
taking effect in the future.

There are two types of suc-
cessful college students:
One excels within the tradi-
tional path; the
other succeeds
by drawing his
Let's illustrate
these two types
through the ,
stories of hypo-
thetical students
- Ryan and Josh. ERIK
Ryan came to TORENBERG
college with a
simple plan: To
be the best. And he does exactly that
by achieving a 3.9 GPA while study-
ing economics and leading a major
organization on campus.
These activities take up most of
Ryan's time. Old hobbies fall by the
wayside. He can't do everything, but
he does have an active social life.
His accomplishments and easygoing
personality earn him many friends.
They relish when his name comes up
in conversation: "Oh, you know Ryan
too? Yeah, he's great! How do you
know him?"
Ryan works hard. He often gets
little sleep. But once in a while, he
makes time to let go: He watches bad
sitcoms. He fights with his ex-girl-
friend. He goes out to black out.
Still, Ryan leaves his mark on cam-
pus. He mentors many students in
matters personal and professional.
He develops close relationships with
influential professors and alumni.
Their approval encourages him to
work harder, be better.
Ryan doesn't choose this path
because he is passionate about it. He
doesn't always enjoy those problem
sets, those sleepless nights.
Ryan chooses this path because
it fits his personality. His identity
has roots in academic excellence
and future professional success, so
he achieves what he believes to be
absolutely necessary - one hell of a
resum.
And the pieces fit. He has a natural
aptitude for economics. He found his
organization early on, but he could

have had a different major, joined a
different organization and achieved
just as much.
In hindsight, Ryan was very proud
of his college experience, and deserv-
edly so. After graduation, he chose
between high-paying positions at
highly respected companies.
Most importantly, Ryan never let
success get to his head. He remained
jovial, caring and honest.
Josh, the second case, finishes col-
lege with a GPA of 3.3 in the same
major as Ryan. The class work does
not inspire him to strive for perfec-
tion. He is too curious and too stub-
born. He is determined to prioritize
his education over his grades.
Josh stumbles with his extra-
curricular activities too. He joins
a group, immerses himself in it and
then leaves when he feels he has
maximized the ratio of personal
benefits to time put in. He becomes
an extracurricular nomad. To oth-
ers, it seems like he is all over the
place.
But Josh keeps exploring opportu-
nities. He begins to notice patterns,
certain aspects he enjoys about his
experiences and ones that he does
not, and applies such recognition to
his future endeavors.
Josh dedicates most of his time to
his passions: He reads voraciously.
He experiments with filmmaking.
He pursues these side projects with
peers who share similar interests,
many of whom become his close
friends.
He creates his own social scene.
Certain things that once seemed
integral to his college experience -
football games, party culture, social
status - suddenly become less sig-
nificant. The vicissitudes of college
life allow him to detach just enough
to realize what exactly has lasting
importance: losing yourself in a pas-
sion, a project, a person.
In hindsight, this path, albeit
circuitous, also fits Josh's person-
ality. When others inquired about
his ostensibly random decisions, he
would say that he simply followed his
intuition. Josh knew he had a unique

skill set that could not and should not
be boxed; he just needed to find a way
to put it all together.
Josh would also choose between
quality options after college - ones
that matched his interests, values
and desired career path.
Strive to be the
best version of
yourself.
Ryan and Josh are intriguing case
studies because they challenge our
perception of success. We typically
differentiate between outer success
- money, lifestyle and reputation -
and inner success - mastering our-
selves, pursuing wisdom and having
meaningful relationships with oth-
ers.
Ryan equates success with
achievement: He receives a high
mark in anything assigned to him.
The grade is more important than
what he does or how he does it.
Although he knows that outer suc-
cess doesn't necessarily equal inner
success, he believes attaining the for-
mer will make attaining the latter a
bit easier.
Josh equates success with per-
sonal excellence: He pursues his pas-
sions and lets his conscience judge
his performance. This satisfied con-
science is more important than any
external measure of achievement.
Although he is aware that attaining
inner success doesn'tnecessarilylead
to attaining outer success, he doubts
the converse is true - that aiming for
the latter will facilitate the former.
Regardless, he would not do so even
if he could.
It all leads to this: Whereas Ryan
strives to be the best in everyone's
eyes, Josh strives to be the best in his
own: the best version of himself.

Where to draw the line with
the First Amendment
TO THE DAILY:
Monday's article in The Michigan Daily
(Pro-Life group displays controversial images
on Diag, 10/4/2011) showed that many students
reacted to the enormous and graphic images of
aborted fetuses with outrage and disgust, ques-
tioning why the University even allowed such a
display by the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform
and Students for Life. The First Amendment
empowers and encourages a critical and con-
structive response to the shocking protests on
our campus.
The First Amendment necessarily and
intentionally protects even the most abhorrent
speech in order to protect the free expression
of all individuals in our society. If government
laws or University rules are used to silence the
speech of one group, they can be used - and
have been used throughout our nation's history
- to silence any speech found objectionable.
Still, as important as it is to maintain our
commitment to free speech, it is imperative to
The 'U' should not have
allowed the Diag exhibit


realize that such blatant attacks on women's
rights are aimed primarily to instill fear and
guilt in those confronted with reproductive
decisions. We must stand by our commitment
to free speech while continuing our dedication
to the protection and advancement of repro-
ductive freedom.
It is undeniable that this week's incen-
diary pro-life demonstration facilitated a
vibrant community discourse; our campus
is freshly abuzz with discussion of both free
speech and abortion rights. In order for our
University to remain a dynamic community
that promotes a free exchange of ideas, the
Diag and its other public spaces must remain
open forums. If the Diag is to be a place for
any dialogue, it must be place for all dialogue,
no matter how unpopular or disturbing. Our
response to the hateful speech ever-frequent
on our campus must be a re-dedication to
these constitutional rights that are threatened.

GAP to campus - show hate toward racial,
ethnic and religious groups, they demon-
strated hate toward women. Essentially, to
compare the mass murders of people to abor-
tion indicated that they view all women who
are pro-choice as murderers. I am appalled
that the University, one of the most open-
minded places I could ever imagine, allowed
the act of hate crimes to appear on campus
for not just one, but two days. I can't even
understand why one of the University's stu-
dent organizations would think to invite
such a thing to the campus.
Aside from this, a member of the center at
one point actually insulted the demographic
it targeted - a.k.a. students themselves - by
refuting an individual student's argument
with the statement, "You're a college student.
You can't understand."
No one, pro-life or pro-choice, should
ever condone this "project." Ever. Especially
one of the most diverse universities in the
world.

TO THE DAILY:
To the University of Michigan:
To be quite frank, I am disappointed in
my college for the first time since visitingthe
University about seven years ago.
I, and every student at this great school,
understand the importance of freedom of
speech and the right to peacefully assemble
- specifically on the Diag here at the Univer-
sity. This exercise of the First Amendment
on the center of the University is what makes
Michigan special.
However, while members of the Genocide
Awareness Project cloaked themselves in
their right of exercising free speech, their
display was an act of hate crime - a hate
crime against the families and friends of
victims of the Holocaust, slavery, refugees
from the genocides in Cambodia, Darfur and
Rwanda.
Not only did members of the Center for
Bio-Ethical Reform - which brought the

During the past few weeks,
campus has been saturated
with images of bloody fetus-
es, the voices of
radical preachers
and hate-mon-
gering protest-
ers. Like many of
you, during my
daily walk to and '
from classes I've
come across peo-
ple broadcasting EAGHAN
their message to DAVIS
the thousands
of students who
cross the Diag each day.
The University is an easy target
for these people. Historically, Michi-
gan has served as a breeding ground
for liberal social and economic ide-
als. From activist John Sinclair to
former President John F. Kennedy,
some of the most important fig-
ures of the 20th century have used
the University as a launching point
for their ideas. Last year marked
the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's
establishment of the Peace Corps on
the steps of the Michigan Union. In
1965, more than 200 faculty mem-
bers canceled their classes and host-
ed "teach-ins" to protest the United
States's occupation of Vietnam. In
1969, America's first student renters
union was founded at the University
with the support of the United Auto
Workers. But why are any of these
events relevant today?
Over the course of our lifetimes,
we've seen the collapse of the Amer-

ican economic system, American
involvement in two wars - propa-
gated by an administration that
seemed more concerned with the
military-industrial complex than
American lives - and an emergence
of shall I say "scary" right-wing radi-
cals who call for a country governed
by religious ideals rather than civil
liberties.
Today our country and campus
stand at the crossroads of an identity
crisis. Outside groups like the Cali-
fornia-based Center for Bio-Ethical
Reform - who on Monday and Tues-
day attempted to equate the slaugh-
ter of 12 million people by Nazis to
a woman's right to choose - are
omnipresent on campus. Last year,
the University garnered nation-
al media attention when former
Michigan assistant attorney general
Andrew Shirvell publicly harassed
and defamed Chris Armstrong, the
Michigan Student Assembly's first
openly gay president.
Many students on campus have
denounced these events, but out-
right counter-protest has been
minimal. I can assure you many
people with thoughts contrary to
mine are hoping for me to denounce
their right to express their ide-
als. I won't. Our country has been
built upon citizens' right to express
their opinions freely. I'm personally
impressed by the ability of right-
wing groups to organize and dem-
onstrate on campus - no matter
how ludicrous I think their ideals
may be. But without dissent, these

groups will become ever-present on
campus and eventually nationwide.
As history shows, groups who make
the University their focal point of
attack tend to influence the country
as a whole.
Don't ignore the
issues, take
a stand.
So, Michigan students, it's time to
react. Political tension in the United
States fosters democratic ingenuity.
It may not be 1960, but I think our
grandparents would contend that
Washington is as troubling today as
it was 50 years ago.
When you see something that
troubles you, you're probably not
the only one. Rather than passing
protesters and ignoring them, take
a stand. Many of my professors have
said that student activism is dead,
but I tend to disagree. The time, if
ever, is now for a rebirth of student
activism. If we continue to stand by
and passively allow fundamental
religious, social and economic free-
doms to be defiled, our prosperity
and our lives are bound to change. 0
It's up to us to determine how so.

career. Graciously, the only tie to
the movies is star Drew Barry-
more, who serves as an executive
producer (also known as The Title
That Means Jack) on the show.
This "Charlie's Angels" fol-
lows the standard copy-paste
checklist of every modern-day
reboot, filling out the cast list
with pretty young things, blaring
a top-40 soundtrack (Rihanna's
"S&M," natch) and establishing
the contemporary setting (almost
desperately flashing iPads and
referencing Twitter feeds), while
keepingthe iconic theme song and
basic premise - in this case, three
women work for a rich do-gooder
named Charles Townsend who's
always heard but not seen.
The new Angels aren't exactly
a heavenly trio of actresses, but
consider the casting restrictions
and it's easier to be forgiving:
The leads have to be leggy ladies

who are Gorgeous with a capital
G and athletic enough to lay the
smackdown on chumps - not
exactly a sample size bubbling
with acting talent. Minka Kelly
("Friday Night Lights") is the
most famous of the bunch but also
the weakest link, delivering dia-
logues as a posh secret agent with
the same amount of panache she
had as a cheerleader in a podunk
Texas town. The other Angels
are a former cop (Annie Ilonzeh,
"General Hospital") and a former
socialite (Rachael Taylor, "Grey's
Anatomy"), the latter wearing
the shiniest halo of the cast as a
prissy princess turned ass-kicker
extraordinaire.
But so far, the Angels have
as much chemistry as a paper-
mache volcano filled with baking
soda and Kool-Aid. The humdrum
writing is as much to blame as the
acting, but the show has a micro-
scopic chance at success unless
the camaraderie of the Angels is
ramped up.
The final member of the crew
is the Angels' sidekick, resident
Adonis and weak attempt at comic
relief, Bosley (Ramon Rodriguez,
"Transformers: Revenge of the
Fallen"). His character is the
only prominent alteration from

the original, de-aging from an
older chap (appropriately played
by Bill Murray in the 2000 film)
to a young, ladykilling lothario -
clearly it would be too sexist to
have the ladies use seduction as a
weapon, so in the pilot, it's up to
Bosley to be the piece of meat.
Salvation is found in the action
of "Charlie's Angels," as the ladies
(and gentleman) display amaz-
ing athletic prowess, engaging
in full-throttle combat against
hordes of nasty henchmen. With
eye-popping stunts galore, these
secret agent women are the best
female action heroes since "Kim
Possible."
The pilot admirably tries to
raise the stakes with a whopper
of a twist midway through, but
its ramifications essentially fade
away by the second episode. And
besides some sweet feats by the
Angels, both episodes lacked any
true "wowza" moments to justify
a weekly watch (except for a char-
acter in the second episode played
by the Old Spice Guy, what a man).
Right now, the show is the enter-
tainment equivalent of a pack-
age of Kraft American slices - if
we're chowing down on cheese, is
it too much to ask for a wheel of
gouda?

This, for better or for worse, is

For one hour every week, Maria

Realistically, if you're watch-

As Detective Timoney, with her
"take-no-crap" attitude and deep
empathy, she is honestly likeable,
sauntering through her scenes
with the sharpness of an experi-

pilot, a little boy who watched his

"I would help you," is powerful

WALL STREET
From Page 1A
tests are a response to the eco-
nomic hardships confronting
many families and small business
owners throughout the country.
"The financial crisis caused a
deep recession in our economy,
and there are many individuals
who are struggling to make ends
meet and to get a job and to live
their lives given the economic
difficulties," Barr said. "I think
there's an understandable frus-
tration with the difficult eco-
nomic circumstances that many
families are experiencing now
and a desire for change."
But Barr said it is too soon to
tell what changes might come as
a result of the protests.

Michael Heaney, an assistant
professor in the Department of
Political Science, called the pro-
tests "part of a long-standing
social movement for greater eco-
nomic equality" that began with
the anti-World Trade Organiza-
tion sentiments in the late 1990s.
However, he said demonstrators'
use of Wall Street as a symbol for
economic inequality is a more
recent phenomenon.
Heaney added that when
recent rallies erupted in Los
Angeles, Chicago, Boston and
Washington D.C., the protests
proved more successful than
expected. However, he said the
protests are not likely to have a
long-lasting significant impact.
"The protesters are not going
to ... engage the political system,"
Heaney said. "They're not going

to get involved in elections, they
don't engage in lobbying, they
don't make any campaign contri-
butions - they don't do the kinds
of things that will allow them to
have a major impact."
But Heaney said the protesters
might see some results by rais-
ing awareness about issues such
as income inequalities, corpo-
rate accountability, the environ-
ment and rising student debt. He
added that the demonstrations
could alter some politicians'
agendas if the protesters spread
their message successfully.
"What politicians may do is
they may look at these protests
and see them as an expression of
the things that ordinary people
care about," Heaney said. "And
if they see them that way, they
may be more likely to take up

some of these issues in their
campaigns."
The protests could also bol-
ster the efforts of politicians as
they hope to push legislation
through Washington. President
Barack Obama's recent proposal
to create a minimum tax rate for
Americans earning more than
$1 million per year could receive
support from the protesters who
are in favor of higher taxes for
the wealthy, Heaney said.
Heaney said that though he
predicts the protests won't prog-
ress much further, he wouldn't
be surprised if he is proven
wrong given the proliferation of
groups nationwide mimicking
Occupy Wall Street.

UMHS
From Page 1A
UMHS is at risk of losing $100
million from its clinical operating
margin in the next seven years,
she said.
Pescovitz also wants UMHS
to cultivate an "interdisciplinary
learning environment," improve
patient care experience and
engage in "groundbreaking" dis-
coveries. She highlightedUMHS's
success this past year, citing that
the University received the most
funding from the National Cancer
Institute out of any other academ-
ic medical center in the country in
the 2010 fiscal year.
U.S. News and World Report
ranked the University Medical
School tenth in research in the
nation in 2010 and the Univer-
sity Nursing School sixth in the

nation, Pescovitz added.
"We really have a lot to be
proud of," Pescovitz said in her
speech.
However, the mood of her
speech shifted slightly, as Pesco-
vitz addressed ongoing nego-
tiations between UMHS and the
Michigan Nurses Association.
The negotiations started in April,
and nurses at UMHS have not had
a contract since July.
Pescovitz emphasized the
importance of competitive wages
and benefits for the nurses at
UMHS..
"Our nurses are really on the
front line of seeing our patients,"
she said. "Our nurses are critical
to creating the ideal patient care
experience ... and ensuring qual-
ity patient care."
Ann Sincox, a member of the
Michigan Nurses Association,
said in August that UMHS's focus

on facility expansion is a main
reason for the current contro-
versy.
"The only concern UMHS has
expressed recently is how much
the new Mott Children's Hospi-
tal is costing them," Sincox said
at the time. "Their decision to
build at a time that the economy
slumped should not be paid for on
the backs of the nurses."
Despite the ongoing negotia-
tions, the hospitals and health
centers unit of UMHS recorded
strong year-end fiscal reports
in June. The unit showed an
expected operating margin of
2.1 percent on revenues of $2.1
billion for the 2011 fiscal year,
according to a June 16 UMHS
press release.
For its 2012 budget, which the
University's Board of Regents
voted on in June, the unit pro-
jected a 3-percent positive oper-

ating margin, the press release
states. Hospitals and health cen-
ters adjusted their projection to
a 1.1-percent negative operating
margin after accounting for the
opening of the newly renovated
C.S. Mott Children's Hospital
and Von Voigtlander Women's
Hospital and the initiation of the
first phase of Mi-Chart - a new
information technology system
for UMHS. The updated hospitals
are set to open next month.
Despite the strain that the
two projects will place on the
UMHHC budget, Doug Strong,
chief executive officer of the unit,
acknowledged the long-term ben-
efits of the new hospitals.
"These two projects ... will
prepare us to serve even more
patients, and in a more effi-
cient environment, for decades
to come," Strong wrote in the
release.

STARTUPS

ate businesses that improve the
Michigan economy," Coleman
said.
Timothy Slottow, the Univer-
sity's executive vice president
and chief financial officer, said
in a question-and-answer ses-
sion after Coleman's speech that
the University is making a smart
choice by investing in start-
ups, and it may choose to invest
more in certain companies in the
future.
"We're excited about it. It's a
little bit different than what we
typically do," Slottow said. "It
adds more diversification, and
we're long-term investors so
we're willing to stick with them
for as long as it takes."
After the event, Coleman told
the press that though the pro-
gram is exclusively supporting
faculty startups, it could eventu-
ally expand to aid student busi-
nesses. However, the student
startups would have to meet the
same requirements as faculty
startups.
With an eye toward the Uni-
versity's bicentennial in 2017,
Coleman also announced the
formation of the Third Century
Initiative. The $50 million pro-
gram is tasked with developing
multidisciplinary approaches
to solving problems associated
with climate change, poverty
and other societal problems.
Coleman said the initia-
tive will focus specifically on
"immersive learning experienc-
es" for undergraduate students,
like studying abroad or devel-
oping innovative projects in the
United States. The initiative
will also focus on "grand chal-
lenge problems," with students
from different disciplines col-
laborating to find a solution. She
gave an example of Engineering
and Medical students working
together to examine a body after
a car crash to better understand
vehicle safety.
"It's the multidisciplinary
approach," Coleman said. "It's
getting everyone who has to do

with any part of the problem to
see the whole problem and not
just their little piece."
Coleman said it was named
the Third Century Initiative
because she and University
Provost Philip Hanlon, who
assisted in the program's devel-
opment, want to move the Uni-
versity forward into its third
century as a public institution.
Hanlon
"(The initiative is called)
Third Century because we
believe the teaching, research
and service that grow out of this
initiative will propel the Uni-
versity into its next 100 years
with enormous momentum,"
Coleman said. "It will secure
Michigan's future position as the
world's leading public research
university."
The Third Century Initiative
will be financed through exist-
ing University resources, as
funds from various schools and
colleges have been reallocated
for the initiative.
The Third Century Initiative
is intended to fund the activities
University faculty and students
are increasingly engaging in -
such as undergraduate research,
study abroad and entrepreneur-
ial work - Hanlon said.
"What the Third Century Ini-
tiative is really all about is, again,
taking the best ideas that are
emerging from campus and try-
ing to advance them and acceler-
ate them," he said.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after Coleman's
address, Hanlon said the new
initiatives are meant to usher the
University into its bicentennial
in six years.
"We want to really generate
a lot of excitement, spur a lot of
creativity, spur a lot of innova-
tion on this campus by the whole
community, students, faculty,"
Hanlon said. "Students can have
a lot of great ideas here too, and
what we want to do is really hit
the bicentennial with a lot of for-
ward momentum."

COUNCIL
From Page 1A
lenger Stuart Berry. Berry said
he hopes funding reductions to
public safety departments haven't
adversely affected safety in the
city, and, if elected, he would work
to limit city funding to basic ser-
vices.
"When times are tough, council
has to make tough choices that are
not part of basic services," Berry
said.
In an interview after the event,
Anglin said his ultimate concern
for students is safety.
"I want to make sure when,
late at night, when the students
are moving around much later
than the general population,
that they remain safe and that

we have enough police out there
to make sure (of) that," Anglin
said. "I'd like to change the light-
ing ordinances just to make sure
that landlords in the area need
to know they have to light their
properties."
The candidates also discussed
the annual street and sidewalk
mileages to improve city streets
and sidewalks that Ann Arbor resi-
dents will vote on in November.
Currently, residents are responsi-
ble for repairing sidewalks in front
of their homes, but the mileage
would transferthatcduty to the city.
Kunselman and Parker both
said they would support the annu-
al street mileage. Kunselman said
this year's mileage also includes
improvements to bridges, which
was not in past mileages. He also
noted that this could include the

East Stadium Boulevard Bridges
project currently being discussed
by City Council.
Republican Ward 4 candi-
date Eric Scheie said the current
sidewalk policy is inefficient and
expressed concern over whether
the city has repaired the sidewalks
of residents who contracted the
city.
Berry said he was concerned
that money used for the street
mileage would not be used prop-
erly. He said he would vote against
the sidewalk mileage because he
believes it would be unfair to tax
people who had already improved
their sidewalks using their money.
Candidates were also asked
about the proposed Fuller Road
Station - a mass transit project
headed by the city, the University
and several state and federal gov-

ernment entities.
Citing the recent debate over
the station, Kunselman said there
is a lack of information regarding
the project, and the University
has not been forthcoming with
resources. He noted that current
plans only show the construction
of a parking structure rather than
a train station.
"I'm again very reluctant on
the whole project because unless
it actually includes a train station
... I will not support it," Kunsel-
man said.
Scheie said the project should
be voted on by residents, and not
just the council.
"I don'tlike the planand Ithink
it's undemocratic," Scheie said.

From Page 1A
it helps explain how everyday
objects work.
"I have a very fond memory
of beinga sophomore at William
and Mary, and my orgo pro-
fessor explaining how rubber
bands worked," she wrote. "I
just thought, wow, I never even
thought about how they work
and now I can explain it just
by understanding the chemical
structure of rubber."'
Upon arriving to the Universi-
ty four years ago, McNeil studied
structure-property relationships
in molecules in two separate
research projects.
"In one area we design small
molecules, which undergo a
solution-to-gel transition -
think Jell-O - when triggered
by analytes," she wrote. "We are
interested in these materials as
sensors, ultimately."
Much of her research centers
on the design of the molecules,
because scientists do not yet
understand why some mol-
ecules form gels and others do
not.
McNeil's other research proj-
ect is concerned with conjugat-
ed polymers, materials that can
absorb and emit light as well as
conduct charge. The polymers
are used in solar cells and tran-
sistors, according to McNeil.
In her research, McNeil
works primarily on the synthe-
sis of new polymers or the com-
bination of large molecules with
repeatingunits.
The money from the grant
will be used to research gra-
dient copolymers, which are
molecules that have "a gradual
change in sequence from one
chain end to the other," McNeil
wrote.
Jablonowski has been build-

ing virtual climate models
- computer models that help
scientists predict weather fore-
casts - using a technique called
adaptive mesh refinement that
can help in the understanding
of "future climate change sce-
narios," she explained.
"The system is an adaptive
grid ... because the resolution
of the grid spacing is not uni-
form," Jablonowski said. "In
some areas you have wider grid
spacing, and in some areas you
have smaller grid spacing, and
depending on the spacing you
capture different features of the
atmosphere."
She added that the spacing
of the virtual grid is important
because a finer grid highlights
specific areas, while a wider
grid provides less detail. So if
scientists are tracking a particu-
lar storm, they can increase the
number of grids in the storm's
specific area and decrease the
number in other areas.
Jablonowski, who received
her Ph.D. in atmospheric and
space sciences and scientific
computing for atmospheric,
oceanic and space sciences from
the University, said this particu-
lar field of research combines all
her academic interests.
"My background is quite
interdisciplinary, so my back-
ground is an atmospheric sci-
ence background," she said.
"That's my home discipline,
but I was always interested in
numerical methods and applied
mathematics and also in com-
puter science."
McNeil and Jablonowski said
students made their work and
the awards feasible.
"I always say to my students
that it also pays tribute to their
work because without their fun-
damental contributions, I don't
think it would have been pos-
sible," Jablonowski said.

"The things that happened

when the ball's on the ground, it's
ours."
Four players have intercep-
tions. Seven players have forced
fumbles. Three players have
scored defensive touchdowns.
Everyone's buying in.
Hoke says the turnaround
starts up front with his defen-
sive linemen - once Van Bergen,
Martin and junior defensive end
Craig Roh started being "disrup-
tive" by themselves, it opened up
the world to Mattison. The line-
backers could do their job. And
the secondary could disguise
coverages and double team play-
ers if they needed to.
At one point, Mattison chal-
lenged his front-four, saying,
"We're going to start rushing just
you four, you have to hit home."
"(It) allows us to go back and
forth: pressure, no-pressure,"
Mattison said Tuesday. "Or make
it look like pressure, when it's
really not pressure."
Roh, in particular, has four
tackles for loss and two sacks the
past three games. But on Tues-
day, Mattison challenged him to
be even better - tobe the impact
player Mattison needs his rush
end to be.
In the past, it would've been
enough if Roh just worried about
himself.
"I think individuals have
probably tapped into confidence.

(in the past)," Van Bergen said.
"There have been guys that have
played well. But as far as confi-
dence in the unit, that's more of
a new thing."
Together they're No. 2. Divid-
ed they're No. 107.
Mattison threw out schemes
and variations that didn't fit this
version of the Michigan defense.
He'll only use what they know
and are comfortable with, and
only bring in new schemes when
they're ready.
Maybe, just maybe, the turn-
around started when they all
started having fun. Mattison pre-
pares them so they know what
plays are going to be run, where
they're going to. go and what
the opponents' tendencies are.
Demens said the game prepara-
tion this season is well ahead of
what the defense was doing last
season. And Van Bergen called
Mattison's in-game adjustments,
"always correct."
"When an offense hears the
defense calling out their plays,
that's kind of intimidating,"
Demens said.
Really, though, at this point,
the turnaround could be attrib-
uted to all of the above.
"I think it's schemes,"Van Ber-
gen said. "I think it's guys buying
in. I think it's experience - we've
got a lot of guys who have played
a lot of football. I think it's just
confidence. There's a swagger
about our defense. When you're
playingthe waywe're playing, it's
a lot more fun to play.

ED RIN KI RK IA ND/D
Defensive coordinator Greg Mattison has prepared his unit well this season.

fifth-year senior was skeptical
at first. Then he saw how fresh
he was in the fourth quarter,
and how he and senior defensive
tackle Mike Martin, who played
upwards of 90 snaps a year ago,
had enough energy to go 100 per-
cent when they were in the game.
On Saturday, Van Bergen played
28 snaps and got his first sack of
the season.
"With so many things that
have gone right with coach
Mattison and all these coaches,
we've all bought into everything
they've told us," Van Bergen said.
"Anything that they say, goes."

Maybe the turnaround start-
ed when Mattison came to his
defense with a new rule - when-
ever the ball was on the ground,
in any drill, whether it was an
incompletion or thrown out of
bounds, or whenever the ball was
on the ground, the whole defense
had to sprint to the ball and rally
to the endzone.
"Everybody rolled their eyes at
this rule," Van Bergen said. "We
thought, 'Man, this is nuts, we're
going to be tired. We're wasting
time. This is stupid.' Shame on us
because it's been great for us. It's
taught us great habits.

INJURY UPDATE: Junior left
guard Ricky Barnum, who hurt
his leg two weeks ago in a 28-7
win over San Diego State, is ques-
tionable for the game against
Northwestern. Based on what
Hoke said at his press conference
before practice yesterday, his
status for Saturday depends on
what Barnum was able to do at
practice Wednesday - the day of
the week Hoke decides if injured
players will be able to play in the
Saturday game.
"I don't think he's out," Hoke
said. "He didn't do much yester-
day, but today's Wednesday."
Fifth-year senior receiver
Junior Hemingway has been
playing with a protective
arm wrap, but Hoke said that
shouldn't be an issue.
"He's alright," Hoke said.
"He's got a little boo-boo on his
elbow. We did punt yesterday
and he's one of our wings, and he
did a great job protecting."

It was the second quarter and
the Michigan football team was
already up 14-0, but junior run-
ning back Vincent Smith'sjob was
possibly on the line. Well, one of
Smith's many jobs.
He was already the third-down
back and had claimed one of the
top two running back spots early
in the season. But this job - the
person who throws the half back
pass - had the smallest room for
error-
Smith had won the job at the
end of summer, throwing two
successful passes during prac-
tice, but offensive coordinator Al
Borges has a quick trigger fin-
ger when it comes to halfbacks
throwing the ball.
"They get fired fast," Borges
said on Tuesday. "They do. Last
year at San Diego State I fired
Ronnie Hillman after one throw.
He told me, 'Coach, that's too
much pressure, just one pass!' I
go, 'That's tough. It's like Donald
Trump, man. You're out."'
Fortunately for Smith, he
floated a 17-yard pass to wide
open sophomore receiver Drew
Dileo to put Michigan up three
touchdowns. It was just the lat-
est example of Smith proving his
versatility. He tore his ACL in the
last game of his freshman year,
but recovered in time for the sea-
son and didn't miss a game the
following year. Smith rushed for
612 yards, good for second on the
team behind junior quarterback
Denard Robinson.
When Michigan coach Brady
Hoke was hired in the offseason,
he said he wanted to bring a more
traditional power run game back
to the Wolverines. The offense
didn't appear to fit the 5-foot-6,
172-pound Smith anymore.
But Smith said he never
thought about leaving. He lost out
on the running back job to open
the season but found a way to get
on the field as the third-down
back, mostly because of his block-
ing ability. Teammates say that
Smith picks out the biggest guys
to go against in practice and Hoke
has repeatedly praised how tough
his smallest running back is.
"The small guys, they always
got to put a little extra to be
noticed so that's what I do," Smith
said. "I've got to do my job and
just get noticed in a different type
of way."
After a 118-yard performance
against Eastern Michigan, he was
noticed for his running ability too.
Since then, Smith and redshirt
sophomore Fitzgerald Toussaint
have been the main rushers in the
12th-ranked Wolverines' running

This offseason, North-
western created a web-
site, PersaStrong.com, to
support its quarterback
Dan Persa's Heisman
campaign in 2011. But
what if Persa isn't strong
enough to last the sea-
son?
Since rupturing his Achilles'
tendon against Iowa last season,
Persa missed the Wildcats' last
three games and the team went
0-3. He's still recovering from the
injury and missed the 'first three
games of the 2011 season due to
the same injury.
But before he got injured, Persa
set a Big Ten record completing
73.5 percent of his passes last sea-
son. Simply put, the dual-threat
Persa is Northwestern's offense.
At Big Ten Media Day in
August, Persa sat down with the
Daily to talk about the upcoming
season:
The Michigan Daily: Whenev-
er someone mentions the North-
western offense, it starts with you.
What does that mean to you that
you're the catalyst?

Dan Persa: I think anytime
you're the quarterback, you're
going to be the focal point of the
offense, especially in the spread.
You're always counted on to make
the bestplays and put yourteam in
the best positions.
TMD: You've had injuries in
the past. How have they shaped
you?
Persa: Lookipg back on last
year, I think I ran too much. I
kind of look at the injuries as a
blessing in disguise, to improve
on some of the things I want to
improve on in the pocket. It all
depends on how you look at it. I'm
probably not going to be so ready
to run as I was last year. Because
I think last year, my safety net
was, ifa play broke down or if I
wasn't sure of what was going on,
I would just run. And sometimes
it'd be fine because I was athlet-
ic. I think now, I'm going to rely
on making the right decisions,
making the right plays and going
from there.
TMD: You're not going to be
scared to run, are you?
Persa: No, yeah, exactly. Not
scared to run, just being smarter
with the ball and my body.
TMD: When healthy, are you

faster than some of your skill posi-
tion guys?
Persa: Not anymore. Caught up
with me last year.
TMD: Because of the injuries?
Persa: No, just because the
guys are faster. We've got some
fast guys.
TMD: What were you working
on this offseason to get better?
Persa: I think just making
throws from the pocket. That's
really what I've been working on.
And really just focusing on mak-
ing the reads downfield and exe-
cuting the play.
TMD: With Jeremy Ebert and
Co., it seems you have a lotof qual-
ity receivers to throw to. What's it
like throwing to a deep group of
wideouts?
Persa: I think we've got a lot of
guys who make a lot of plays and
that's why I'm excited to get the
ball to them instead of running.
TMD: How's your spread
offense set up? Can you just pick
and choose as the quarterback?
Persa: For the most part. I
mean, we have direction and we
have concepts that we direct our
eyes to and you always have safety
nets. But I think last year, instead
of goingto the safety nets, I would

just run instead of throwing a five-
yard out. That's where I need to
improve.
TMD: What did you learn about
yourself as a quarterback last sea-
son, during your breakout year?
Persa: I learned that I can play
with the best. And at the same

time, I learned I have a lot to
improve on. Taking better care of
the ball and doing the little things
to be successful.
TMD: How do you and coach
Pat Fitzgerald plan on getting
Northwestern back on the map?
Persa: I think just winning

games, at the end of the day.
That's all we can do. That's all
we can control. Can't control
what the media thinks about us
or how they portray us. I think,
just working as hard as we can to
prepare ourselves to win as many
games as we can.

After losing start of the season, stopping
three of its last four matches in three shots in the first half, but
overtime, the Wolverines suf- the Wolverines did not make it
fered another disappointing loss easy for him.

"We definitely struggled in
the first half - we tried to gain
some momentum in the second
half, and we did," said senior
defender Eric Leifland. "I think
we outplayed them in the sec-
ond half. We tried to go at them
at the flanks and go around
them. We were just unlucky in
the box."
The second half saw a dif-
ferent Michigan team, one that

matched the aggressive pace
Western Michigan set in the
first half.
Despite the increased level
of play, Bronco junior forward
Yllson Asani headed a free kick
into the right corner of the goal
just two minutes into the second
half.
Michigan responded 10 min-
utes later when junior midfield-
er David Yang scored his first
career goal with an assist from
sophomore forward Ezekiel
Harris to tie the match at 1-1.
"Great for David Yang," said
Michigan coach Steve Burns
said.
"He worked his socks off
today and continued to try and
get in behind their defense and
he struck a real nice shot."
The Wolverines and Broncos
battled it out for more than 20
scoreless minutes.
teifland led the Michiann

defense, keeping Western Mich-
igan to only two shots in the
second half. With less than 10
minutes remaining when fresh-
man defender Kyle Farris scored
his first-career goal to put West-
ern Michigan ahead, 2-1.
In the last 10 minutes of the
match, the Wolverines struggled
aggressively, collecting two yel-
low cards after failed attempts
to gain control.
Despite the second-half
surge, Michigan simply couldn't
change its luck.
"Sometimes you need luck to
win games and so far luck has
not been on our side," Harris
said.
According to Harris, 80 per-
cent of this young team is play-
ing together for the first time
and still searching for their
luck. Michigan is 1-1 in the Big
Ten, but it still has time to make
a cenference run.

of bridesmaids and bouquets, groomsmen in
tuxedos, the groom and (of course) the tulle-frosted bride
posing together for wedding photos.
Weddings are easy to spot simplybecause they're a cher-
ished, hyped-up part of our culture. And for many married
couples, the day they exchange vows and say "I do" is the
most important day of their lives. A wedding is the fruit-
ful culmination of months of planning: Picking a venue, the
colors, flowers, linens, bridesmaids and groomsmen, the
rings - there are countless components that make ceremo-
nies like this asbeautiful as they are. For couples who bleed
maize and blue, some of those decisions, such as the color
scheme and location, are obvious. There's no place they
would rather get married than the University.
Big House wedding bells
This summer, the Athletic Department announced the
possibility of holding private events in many of the athletic
spaces on campus. The most exciting of these locations is
the football field, where just weeks ago, the Wolverines stole
a victory from Notre Dame in the final seconds of the Uni-
versity's first night game.
"It's more than just weddings at the Big House," said Ath-
letic Director David Brandon. "It's really taking these won-
derful spaces that we've created that rarely get used, and
trying to put them to work in such a way that people can
enjoy them."
Brandon played a crucial role in the Athletic Depart-
ment's recent decision to open the Big House and other ath-

letic venues for private events.
"There are a lot of people who graduate from here who
love this place and have an emotional connection to it,"
Brandon said. "These spaces will often be appealing to peo-
ple and give them a chance to connect with the University."
Although this option just became a possibility in late
June, there have alreadybeen several bookings.
"Everyone that has had anything in (the Big House) walks
away raving," said Katy Hepner, special events coordinator
for the Athletic Department. "It exceeds all expectation.
And when you have the historical tradition of Michigan
football in the back-
drop, we're setting our-
selves up for success." Th '

FOOD9 WARS
Each week, one Ann Arbor staple menu item becomes a
battlefield as Daily Arts editors butt heads over
which restaurant makes it best.
PLAIN BAGEL WITH CREAM CHEESE

I

PANERA BREAD
777 North University Avenue
Plain bagels can be boring, but Panera's
version of this food item is delicious. The
bagel is perfectly toasted so that it's crisp
on the outside but chewy on the inside.
The cream cheese is mercifully spread-
able and tasty. All the awkwardness that's
usually associated with a normal slab of
cold cream cheese is nowhere to be found
here.
BRUEGGER'S
709 North University Avenue
With a lightly crispy outside to comple-
ment the thick and soft interior, Brueg-
ger's gets it right with its homemade
bagels. Throw in some signature cream
cheese, with just the right balance of

ZINGERMAN'S BAKEHOUSE
3711 Plaza Drive
Zingerman's doesn't serve plain bagels.
Zingerman's Bakehouse makes a 1610 tra-
ditional bagel which, despite its crisp crust
and chewy innards, is bland. What sets this
classic apart is the cream cheese. Made by
hand at Zingerman's Creamery, the fluffy
spread, with its light milky flavor, adds
enough zest to the plainest of plain bagels to
make it an ideal part of any Sunday brunch.

530 South State Street
From your mouth's perspective, the
bagel is fine. It's dense and chewy with a
nice crust. But our eyes sense something
is wrong - there is no hole in the center!
Even if we could overlook this amateur
mistake, we can't forgive the smattering
of nothing-special cream cheese, which is
especially insulting when the pair tallies
up to $1.99.

A toast to public speakers

The lyrical
labor ofpoets

Toastmasters
advises its members
in the art of speech
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily Arts Writer
Shakes. Sweats. Stutters,
"ums" and "likes" - for many,
this is what happens when they
give a speech in front of a large
audience.
But there's a club on campus
that equips its members with
the skills and tips to soothe the
shakes, dry the sweats, smooth
out the stutters and remove the
filler words.
The Ross School of Business
Toastmasters, a local chapter of
Toastmasters International, is a
non-profit organization focused
on the art of public speaking.
Pharmacy student Rachel Rarus
said the group is not only com-
mitted to advancing its mem-
bers' rhetoric abilities, but it also
helps them as people to further
develop their leadership skills.
"A lot of people who come up
to the room are very nervous and
very scared, but what we provide
'them is very positive, encourag-
ing feedback," she said. "We're
not a hostile environment."
Members of Toastmasters
stress how important speech-
giving is in contemporary soci-
ety. It's a useful art for debate
clubs, leadership positions and
jobs that require presentations.
A cinematic example of the
importance of speechmaking
can be found in this year's Oscar
winner "The King's Speech." In
the film, King George VI of Eng-
land overcomes a speech imped-
iment to raise the morale of a
country on the brink of World
War II.
But Daphne Wey, Business

Toastmasters president Daphne Wey and Table Topics Master Ben Hojnacki speak at last week's Toastmasters meeting.

graduate student and Toastmas-
ters president, said though the
group does provide a sheltered
positive environment for its
members to feel comfortable in
terms of experimenting, it's not
meant to be therapy the way the
"The King's Speech" is.
"We're less proactive in push-
ing members and setting a pace
for them on how quickly (they
advance)," she said. "We're
always there for the members,
but in terms of when they want
to give a speech, it's completely
up to the member themselves. So
in that sense, we are more pas-
sive."
Each speech, generally
between five and eight minutes
long, is subject to a series of con-
structive criticisms to help the
members improve. Though the
topics are open-ended, each one
has a different focus or theme

for improvement.
"I've been in Toastmasters
for over eight years now," said
Business graduate student and
Toastmasters vice president of
education Luis Aguilar. "The
very first time I stood up to
speak, I was sweating. I was
shaking, my voice was shaky
and you could hear my nervous-
ness. I could feel that as time
progressed, those things would
start to go. I'd first stop sweat-
ing, then I'd stop trembling and
at some point, my voice leveled."
The group's meetings are
structured with short introduc-
tory talks given by the president
and other key members of the
group. A rotating toastmaster
introduces the day's speak-
ers. Other members include the
timer, who warns the speaker
when his or her time is running
out, and the grammarian, who

not only watches for good use of
language but also the use of filler
words such as "like" and "um."
The toastmaster will then
invite the prepared speakers
to the front. After the speeches
are made, then the "table topics"
start.
Rarus said these table topics
are the "heart and soul" of the
group and allow all the members
to get involved. A question or
picture is posted, and members
are invited to come to the front
of the room and speak sponta-
neously about it for one to two
minutes.
After this portion is over, the
meeting moves on to the evalu-
ation portion, during which the
prepared speakers are praised
on their successes and given tips
to improve their speech delivery
for the next time.

f you meet as many poets as
I do, you get used to hear-
ing talk about "my work"
- how the revisions are going,
whether it's getting published
or ignored,
if maybe
you'd want to
read my new
manuscript.
It's not
exactly the
"work" most
people have DAVID
in mind, but LUCAS
it's the work
so many
people are "out of" in the cur-
rent economy.
If you meet as many non-
poets as I do, you also get used to
the assumption that poets don't
do that kind of "real work." You
can mention that Wallace Ste-
vens was an insurance executive
and William Carlos Williams
a doctor, but that mention gets
met with rolling eyes and snap-
ping fingers. Your exceptions
prove their rule.
Fair enough. So involved are
poets in intellectual and even
spiritual work that it becomes
difficult to imagine them work-
ing physically. But some of this
country's greatest poetry is the
poetry of just those labors.
Walt Whitman presented
himself in the unbuttoned work
clothes of a laborer on the fron-
tispiece of his self-published
"Leaves of Grass" (1855). Hav-
ing worked as asprinter's devil,
Whitman recognized the power
of the printed image in project-
ing a poetic image. He promot-
ed himself as "an American, one
of the roughs," and his "Song
of Myself" contains the sights
and sounds, jargon and slang
of working America: "The pure
contralto sings in the organ
loft," he writes. "The carpenter
dresses his plank, the tongue of
his foreplane / whistles its wild
ascending lisp."
Whitman's work represents
a beginning in our poetic tra-
dition. Other poets continue
that tradition at our current
moment. As John Casteen
worked on his poetry, he also
designed and crafted furniture
for over a decade. His poems
often meditate on the potential-
ly tenuous connections between
artistry and craftsmanship. In
Casteen's poems, physical work
is not only an opportunity for
rich description, but also for
rumination.
In "How to Dig a Grave,"
Casteen instructs: "You start /
with the spade, bearing above
it and down to cut, / and stand
with your arch bold over the
rolled top edge." His physical
work merges with the emo-
tional work of mourning; the
grave proves to be intended for
a beloved "dog made short work
of by another's errand." And in
describingthe grave itself, "the
hole will do its dark work with-
out regard ... You will be made
of work by the end," the words
"work" and "end" resound.
These are examples of a cer-
tain kind of labor, but neither
speaks to the most difficult
work of all: The process we
think of both as a miracle and,
tellingly, as "labor."

In "Bite Me," a poem about
the birth of her daughter, Beth
Ann Fennelly writes that she
"pushed so hard blood vessels
burst / in my neck and in my
chest ... / so hard that for weeks
to come /the whites of my eyes
were red with blood, / my face a
boxer's, swollen and bruised..."
Too often we use the cliche
"blood, sweat, and tears" in
speaking of acts that involve
none of the three. In Fennelly's
poem, the clich6 finds genuine
purchase; we are reminded that
those who produce miracles
must also suffer like saints.
Fennelly's words reveal the
mother's labor as terrifying,
excruciating, and miraculous
indeed.
Though Fennelly's poem
presents the work of love at its
most dramatic, the mundane
too offers itself to poetry. In
"Those Winter Sundays," Mich-
igan alumnus Robert Hayden
writes, "Sundays too my father
got up early." The sly addition
of the word "too" here tells us
plenty of this father's work. He
"put his clothes on in the blue-
black cold, / then with cracked
hands that ached / from labor
in the weekday weather made /
banked fires blaze. / No one ever
thanked him."
Will work
for poems.
Er, on poems.
Er, in poems.
The sounds of the poem,
cracking consonants and
internal rhymes, mirror the
backbreaking, heartbreaking
labor it depicts. And though the
house was cold with "chronic
angers" too, Hayden's speaker
remembers and reproaches
himself: "What did I know, what
did I know / of love's austere
and lonely offices?" We tend to
hear the word "office" as a place
where we do work, but here, it
sounds its old, Latinate meaning:
a matter of duty. Work is work,
whatever kind it is, because it
mustbe done.
Or soI think. Every time I
feel confident writing the word
"work" here, I return to Detroit
native Philip Levine's "What
Work Is," which tells not only of
physical work as the ostensible
subject of the poem, but also
of the love "flooding you for
your brother," who is at home
"sleep(ing) off a miserable night
shift / at Cadillac so he can get
up / before noon to study his
German." It also mentions the
work of saying "I love you" to a
brother, or to anyone, something
we do too rarely "not because
you're too young or too dumb,
/ not because you're jealous or
even mean," but "just because
you don't know what work is."
It wasn't what I thought it
was after all, and it took a poet
to show me.

D FI AUI'MIDDLEMARCH' (1874), GEORGE ELIOT
.'Middlemarch' beyond female fluff

By SHARON JACOBS
ManagingArts Editor
When asked to name 19th-cen-
tury female writers, the one most
likely to come to mind is Jane
Austen, whose detached wit and
social commentaryhave made her
a fixture of high school English
courses. Sensitivity and passion
hidden under her lesser-known
prose, George Eliot (pen name of
Mary Anne Evans) is treated more
like Jane Austen's less attractive
and more introverted sister, albeit
44 years younger.
Eliot's a bit harder to get into
and her most famous novel,
"Middlemarch," has more
slow-blooming pithiness than
quick-wittedness. Compared to
Austen and her rampant popu-
larity, Eliot's the writer who
none of the cool kids liked but
was totally "in" with the geeks at
lunchtime for her deeper humor
and darker psyche.
A hefty read, "Middlemarch"
is really two stories in one - the
tale of Dorothea Brooke, a "later-
born (Saint) Theresa" trying to
find her do-gooder way in the
world, and a portrait of an Eng-
lish town struggling with 19th-
century modernity. Maybe at

times the two sub-stories' meld-
ing is less-than-seamless, and we
long for Austen's effortless flow,
but "Middlemarch" has a certain
relatability - a humanness -
that other writers of Eliot's time
can only idly grasp at. It's a novel
that, despite its sometimes stilt-
ed language, meshes with the
zeitgeist of today as well if not
better than the late 1800s when
it was published.
The people of "Middlemarch"
are instantly recognizable, not as
character tropes but as anyone's
friends and family. There's Fred
Vincy, the university-grad drift-
er whose only certainty is his
love for a childhood sweetheart.
There's Tertius Lydgate, the ide-
alistic, ambitious young doctor
and his wife Rosamond, whose
1800s me-generation entitlement
foils his plans and all hope for a
happy marriage. And of course
there's Dorothea Brooke, at the
novel's start a naive 18-year-old
who makes a very bad decision
and is forever changed by its con-
sequences.
These people are fully-
fledged, their characteristics
derived from basic human wonts,

cuisine for guests during football
games.
Since the Athletic Depart-
ment's announcement, several
groups have booked events and
photo opportunities on the field
and at the Stadium Club. With
four events in October, this
opportunity is quickly gaining
popularity, as Michigan Stadi-
um has a packed schedule in the
upcoming summer months.
"Our winter months are a lit-
tle slower, but in June, July and
August, we're pretty busy with
weddings and some other corpo-
rate conference dinners," Hep-
ner said.
Ana Skidmore, the principle
event planner of TwoFoot Cre-
ative, an eventcplanning company
in the Ann Arbor area, recently
booked her first wedding recep-
tion at the Stadium Club for next
year.
"Weddings in the Big House
are obviously for people who
love the University of Michigan,"
Skidmore said. "The clients I
have booked for next year don't
want to go crazy over Michigan,
but because they're in the Sta-
dium Club, there will be a giant
block 'M' staring at everyone
from the stadium. obviously,
they want Michigan to be a part
of the wedding, but not all of the
wedding."
From a planner's perspective,
Skidmore said there's a fine line

ning themed weddings.
"You need to be careful not
to go overboard, because then it
becomes cheesy and it becomes a
celebration of Michigan and not
the fact that they're getting mar-
ried."
But Skidmore also noted that
it's very easy to plan a themed
wedding with class. She sug-
gested warm mahogany seating
and gold or copper linens to sub-
tly and tactfully tie in maize and
blue to the occasion.
When Skidmore was planning
her own wedding in 2007, she
tried to get married in the Big
House. Her husband, a recruiter
for the football team at the time,
spoke to the department, but it
wasn't an option.
"We did get on the field for


pictures ... but that was the clos-
est we could get," Skidmore said.
"I think what they're trying to
do now, bringing the Michigan
experience to people who might
never have had it before, is really

h it's a depressing movie a logical location for the theme of

their wedding because of its sig-
nificance to the University, but
it holds financial appeal as well.
According to Ley, the couple
would have considered getting
married in the Big House, but
the cost to rent the available ven-
ues wastoo extravagant for their
given budget.
"The Union is only, like,
$2,000 for the rental of both
rooms, and you get some rental
discounts if you're a student,"
Ley said.
On another side of the Diag,
the Michigan League is also an
affordable University venue for a
Michigan-themed wedding.
Ann Cassel, a 2011 graduate of
the University and bride-to-be,
will marry 2010 alum and col-
lege sweetheart Brian Igoe at the
League this May. Both French
horns in the Michigan Marching
Band, the couple met and began
dating when Cassel was a fresh-
man.
According to Cassel, while
on a date after her graduation,
Igoe took her on a detour to the
Bell Tower, where he proposed.
Because the University has been
such a large part of their rela-
tionship, it will be a prominent
part of their wedding ceremony
as well.
"It was our way of life for the
last four or five years," Cassel
said about their time at the Uni-
versity. "We're huge football fans
and it just means so much to both
of us. Without having us both go
here, none of this would be hap-
pening."
A maize and blue color scheme
and yellow flower arrangements
revolve heavily around their con-

nection to the University and the
marching band. One of Cassel's
ideas for table centerpieces uses
old marching band music like
"The Victors," "Let's Go Blue,"
and "Fanfare" as table numbers.
Besides the bride and groom,
the majority of the wedding
party is closely tied to the Uni-
versity as well.
"All of my bridesmaids were
with me in the marching band,"
Cassel said.
Surprisingly, Cassel and Igoe's
participation in marching band
is one of the reasons that Cassel
and Igoe chose not to get mar-
ried in the Big House.
"The thing is, because we've
gotten to do so much in the Big
House, we've already made
important memories there," Can-
sel said.
Memories might be the big-
gest part of what make weddings
so majestic. Despite unending
weeks of preparation to create
a bride's (or groom's) dreams
of the perfect day, vows will
be exchanged, the cake will be
eaten, and the last guests will
leave. What lasts and will be
remembered are two people who
have a profound connection to
one another.
For Best and Ley, Cassel an
Igoe and many other couples,
experiencing these moments at
the University, a place that keeps
the memories of so many people,
can only heighten an already
wonderful occasion.

TOASTMASTERS
From Page 3B
Wey said the evaluation por-
tion is not only helpful for those
three speakers, but also for all
those in the audience. It's an
opportunity to see what tech-
niques worked better than others
and which ones to start incorpo-
rating in their own speech-giving.
Many suggestions focus on
improvement of tonality, which,
much like singing, is fundamen-
tal for speech-giving. Aguilar
said the way he improved this is
by imagining he's trying to speak
specifically to the last person in
the audience or even to the back
wall.
Another common suggestion
is improved eye contact. For this,
members are told to look at each

person, holding eye contact for
three full seconds before moving
on to the next until the speech is
over.
Yet another common critique
involves body language, vocabu-
lary and removal of filler words.
The best way to improve this,
among other skills, is practice.
Finally, remembering a speech
can sometimes be difficult, so in
order to facilitate memorization,
members are encouraged to use
acronyms to remember the top-
ics and to use the stage asa visual
aid.
"It's nice to stay firmly plant-
ed. It shows that you're a strong
speaker," Rarus said. "We also
encourage (the members) to use
the space."
Rarus herself uses what she
calls a "visual timeline," where
she will move from space to

space on the stage as she transi-
tions from speech introduction,
main arguments and conclusion.
Many of the Toastmasters
members started off terrified of
speaking in front of an audience,
but soon progressed to being able
to sign up for a speech on the
spot and give it without worries,
like Wey.
"When I first started (giving
speeches), I would be thinking
about everything," Wey said.
"What am I supposed to say
next? Am I looking at everyone
in the audience? But now, I just
focus on the audience's reactions
and having fun with it."
Members are given the free-
dom to choose their speech top-
ics and are generally encouraged
to speak on something they are
passionate about. Members tend
to migrate toward personal sto-

ries or commentaries about life.
"In Toastmasters we're very
fortunate because people feel
that in this environment they
can really open up," Rarus said.
"(The speeches) are very per-
sonal and reveal some very deep
secrets and things that are very
close to them or people they
love."
Despite the group's affiliation
with Ross, participation is open
to all. Aguilar said they've had
members ranging from students
to doctors to University affili-
ates.
He added that members are
generally divided in to two
groups: those who stick around
for a while, learn some skills and
leave, and those whose lives are
changed by both the skills they
acquire and the group itself.
Aguilar said he's one of the latter.

Toastmasters conducts Table Topics, in which members give impromptu talks.
