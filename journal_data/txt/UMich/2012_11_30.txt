DARTMOUTH BOUND

Hanlon to be
president at
alma mater

Provost leaving Ann
Arbor after more
than 25 years at the
University
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily News Editor
University Provost Philip
Hanlon will become the 18th
president of Dartmouth'College,
succeeding former President Jim
Yong Kim who left the position in
April to serve as president of the
World Bank.
Hanlon was elected presi-
dent by a unanimous vote of
Dartmouth's Board of Trust-
ees on Tuesday, though an offi-
cial announcement was not
made until Thursday. Hanlon,
who received a Bachelor of Arts
degree from the college in 1977,
will assume the presidency on
July 1, 2013. Hanlon will replace
Carol Folt, who has served as
interim college president since
Kim stepped down in April. She
will return to her role as provost
on June 30, 2013.
Hanlon said in an interview
with The Mihigan aily he is
thrilled to indulge his passion for

undergraduate education at Dart-
mouth.
"It's a very great opportu-
nity," Hanlon said. "Dartmouth
is ranked in the top 10 in U.S.
News (and World Report rank-
ings), it's ranked number one in
undergraduate education by U.S.
News. It is my alma mater, it's an
Ivy League institution, and it's a
terrific opportunity."
Nevertheless, Hanlon said he'll
be sad to leave the University,
where he has been a faculty mem-
ber since 1986.
"I love the University of Michi-
gan," Hanlon said. "I have the
greatest admiration for the place, I
admire what it aspires to, I admire
the success it has ... The people
here at the University of Michigan
are terrific and I'll miss them very
much."
Hanlon said he is still unsure
whether or not he will take time
off before beginning his new posi-
tion..
Dartmouth's presidential
search committee had planned on
making a decision by the end of the
calendar year, with the intention
of having their selection assume
the position on July 1, 2013.

Permanent
replacement likely
to be named by
next president
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Editor in Chief
With University Provost
Philip Hanlon set to assume the
presidency at Dartmouth Col-
lege in July, the University will

have to select a new provost
as it also prepares to launch a
search for University President
Mary Sue Coleman's successor.
On Thursday, Coleman wrote
in a campus-wide e-mail that
she would name an interim pro-
vost in the coming weeks, and
several administrators and Uni-
versity regents said they expect
Coleman, whose contract will
expire in 2014, to appoint an
interim provost until her suc-
cessor can make a permanent
selection.

Regents Katherine White
(D-Ann Arbor) and Denise
Ilitch (D-Bingham Farms) each
scid they expect the Univer-
sity will hire an interim pro-
vost until the next president is
appointed. Both said they've
told Coleman that they would
like her to hire an interim pro-
vost.
"I'm a sports person, so I
really respect the ability of a
person, a professional, a coach
so to speak, to put their team
together," Ilitch said. "I have a

lot of respect for that."
The University declined to
comment on the timetable for
when an interim provost will
be named, and White and Ilitch
both said they were unaware if
a search committee had been
formed.
In 2010, Coleman chose Han-
lon to become provost without
forming a search committee or
consulting with a search firm
only two weeks after his pre-
decessor, Teresa Sullivan,

HEALTH CARE
* Committee'
rejects state-
run health
exchange
State, federal gov'ts to
collaborate and create
exchange mandated by
Affordable Care Act
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily News Editor
A Michigan House of Repre-
sentatives subcommittee voted
Wednesday to nix a bill proposing
the creation of a state-run health
care exchange under the federal
Affordable Care Act.
 The decision likely halts the pos-
sibility of Michigan running its own
exchange as the Dec. 14 deadline
and the end of the legislative term
near. The state House Health Care
Policy Committee ultimately decid-
ed in a 5-9 vote, with two absten-
tions, meaning that an exchange
jointly run by the federal govern-,
ment and the state is the most prob-
able course for the implementation
of the Affordable Care Act.
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who
advocated for a state-run exchange
earlier this year, supports the fed-
eral-state partnership, as do state
Democrats. However, state Republi-
cans, who control both chambers of
the state Legislature and the com-
mittee, have opposed the imple-
mentation of the exchange as part of
their resistance to President Barack
Obama's health reforms.
Anticipating opposition in the
state Legislature and facing the
Dec. 14 deadline, Snyder filed a let-

HANLON
From Page 1
mouth, the college's student
newspaper, the next president
would need to be someone who
would not only emphasize aca-
demia to a greater degree than
former presidents, but also some-
one who's willing to address some
of the problems plaguingthe cam-
pus social scene.
Some expressed disappoint-
ment with Kim's lack of will-
ingness to address the more
negative aspects of the school's
social scene. Some blamed the
Greek system, in part, for the
binge drinking, sexual assault
and hazing that are reportedly
common on Dartmouth's campus,
but all agree that the previous
two presidents have not done an
adequate job of addressing these
problems.
Dartmouth English Prof. Ivy
Schweitzer told The Dartmouth
that the next president must be
willing to encourage faculty to
address the campus social scene.
"We have this kind of negative
legacyfrom Kim about bystanders
and the idea that we can't do any-
thing about it and can't change
the culture," she said. "The presi-
dent will have to deal with that
because it just has to be changed
on campus."
Faculty also spoke to a desire
' for a president who would empha-
size academia in a way previous
presidents have not.
"I think Kim left a bad taste
in a lot of people's mouths about
the corporatization of the institu-
tion," Schweitzer said. "We seem
to pay more attention to how the
endowment is doing, how compa-
rable our salaries are."
This sentiment was reinforced
in an e-mail sent to Dartmouth
students on Thursday by Stephen
Mandel, the chair of Dartmouth's
Board of Trustees, announcing
the board's selection of Hanlon
for the presidency.
"Phil's impressive experience
as provost of the University of
Michigan - with 95 departments
in the top 10 nationally and $L27
billion in annual research spend-
ing, second among all universities
- means that Dartmouth will be
in very capable hands," Mandel
wrote in the e-mail. "Phil truly
understands how great scholar-
ship and research are essential to
an undergraduate learning expe-
rience that produces leaders who
can shape and change a world that
is increasingly complex, diverse
and interdisciplinary."
There seemed to be a consen-
sus among faculty that the next
president would need to under-
stand the school's idiosyncrasies,
though they did not expect the
president to come from within.
Faculty also emphasized their
interest in a president with experi-
ence in academia.
Hanlon fit the bill as an alum
familiar with the college, but com-
ing from a different institution,
he has the potential to bring fresh
ideas. His experience in academia
and with administration also
made him an attractive candidate
to the board.
Hanlon acknowledged he will
need to familiarize himself with
"what's going on with the Dart-
mouth campus," but added he has
a sense of what his job will be once
he arrives.

"As with any college or univer-
sity, there are two core pieces of
the mission," Hanlon said. "One
is preparing leaders to go out and
change the world and the other
is to advance knowledge to try to
better people's lives. I'll be want-
ing to work to advance both of
those at Dartmouth."
Former University President
James Duderstadt said in an inter-
view that Hanlon's broad range of
experiences made him a good fit
for Dartmouth.
"Beyond the fact that he's the
alumnus, he's had a very deep
commitment to undergraduate

education, particularly in the lib-
eral arts, which is characteristic of
Dartmouth College," Duderstadt
said. "He'll also bring to the insti-
tution, which calls itself a college
but it has many of the same attri-
butes as the University of Michi-
gan, with significant research
activities, a major medical cen-
ter and so forth, experience both
from leading his department, and
then beinga senior associate dean
of LSA and then finally as provost.
Duderstadt added that he
expects aprimary responsibility of
Hanlon's to be fundraising, which
will be somewhat of a change from
his role as the University's chief
academic and budgetary officer.
"I'm sure that Dartmouth, like
most universities, face significant
financial challenges, although
nothing at the level that Michigan
faces right now," Duderstadt said.
"Most of his activity will be work-
ingwith alumni, major donors and
so forth.
Hanlon, too, noted that he
expects his responsibilities to
shift as he transitions from Uni-
versity provost to president of
Dartmouth.
"One of the big roles of the pres-
ident at any college or university is
fundraising, so that'll be a big part
of my job, I'm sure," Hanlon said.
University Vice-Provost Mar-
tha Pollack said in an interview
that while she will "miss him ter-
ribly," Hanlon will thrive in his
new role.
"Phil is a very skilled leader,"
Pollack said. "He can lead people
to shared goals, he can foster in
excellence and outstanding work,
he has been able to implement fis-
cal discipline, and I think all of
those skills will transfer perfectly
to Dartmouth."
Pollack noted that in his time as
provost, Hanlon has successfully
navigated the University through
difficult financial times.
"He's implemented a real fiscal
discipline that's very important
across universities," Pollack said.
Hanlon has been described
by Pollack and others, includ-
ing University Regent Katherine
White (D-Ann Arbor), as passion-
ate about undergraduate teach-
ing and other academic pursuits.
In an interview, White pointed
to classes Hanlon taught this
fall - including Calculus I and a
course on the University's budget
process titled "The Challenge of
College Affordability: Financing
the University," which he taught
with Pollack - to demonstrate his
commitment to improving under-
graduate coursework.
"He's very focused on the
undergraduate educational expe-
rience and how to take that expe-
rience into the next century and
make sure that the classroom is a
place where students and faculty
are engaged in discussions and
problem solving in ways that are
different from their standard lec-
ture format," White said.
White added that Hanlon has
lived up to expectations.
"I'm very grateful for all the
work Phil Hanlon has done for this
University," she said. "I wish him
the best. Dartmouth is very lucky
to have him. He inspires people.
He has great integrity. That's all
you can ask for someone."
In a campus-wide e-mail, Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man praised Hanlon for his work
in multiple roles at the University.
"As a teacher and Thurnau

professor, his passion for under-
graduate education is palpable,"
Coleman wrote. "As provost since
2010, he has steered the Univer-
sity through some of its most fis-
cally challenging years, all the
while advancing our academic
excellence and impact."
Coleman wrote that she will
name an interim provost in
"upcoming weeks."
In his capacity as chief aca-
demic officer, Hanlon worked
closely with the Senate Advisory
Committee on University Affairs,
and developed a particularly close
relationship with the Provost's

Advisory Committee on Budget-
ary Affairs, according to SACUA
chair Kimberly Kearfott. Kear-
fott said Hanlon would prepare
materials for the committee to
help them understand University
financial issues.
She said the working relation-
ship between SACUA and Hanlon
has been excellent.
"He's been totally open, very
transparent and very accommo-
dating during my term," Kear-
fott said. "It would be very hard
to match Phil Hanlon's activities
during this academic year in that
regard. The new provost should
definitely be an academic com-
mitted to both the research and
teaching enterprises who strongly
supports faculty governance."
Though Kearfott expressed
content with her working rela-
tionship with Hanlon during her
term .as SACUA chair, the rela-
tionship between SACUA and
Hanlon wasn't without disagree-
ment during his time as provost.
In April 2011, the body was
outwardly opposed to Han-
lon's recommendation to extend
the faculty tenure probation-
ary period from eight years to 10
years. The change was ultimately
approved by the University's
Board of Regents.
In addition to earning an
undergraduate degree from Dart-
mouth, Hanlon graduated Phi
Beta Kappa from the institution.
He went on to earn a doctoral
degree from the California Insti-
tute of Technology in 1981, before
teaching applied mathematics at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and serving as the
Bantrell Fellow at CIT.
Hanlon made his way to the
University in 1986, serving first as
an associate professor, and then
making his way up to professor in
1990, ArthurF. Thurnau professor
in 1992 and D.J. Lewis Professor of
Mathematics in 2001. Then from
2001-2004, Hanlon served as LSA
associate dean for planning and
finance before becoming vice pro-
vost for academic and budgetary
affairs from 2004-2010.
He took on the position of
provost in 2010, and as such has
served as the chief academic offi-
cer and chief budgetary officer for
the University.
Hanlon's transition to Dart-
mouth will be informed by some
significant differences between
the two institutions. The Univer-
sity, known as a leading public
research university, spent $1.28
billion on research in 2011, while
Dartmouth expended about
$202.7 million on research for the
same fiscal year.
Dartmouth College was found-
ed in 1769 and is a member of the
Ivy League. The school has 4,194
undergraduates and 1,950 gradu-
ate students, numbers that pale
in comparison to the University
of Michigan's 27,407 undergradu-
ates and 15,447 graduate students.
However, both schools have
performed well with respect to
their endowments. Dartmouth's
endowment is valued at $3.4 bil-
lion, and it yielded a higher return
on investment than any other
school in the Ivy League for the
2012 fiscal year. The University
of Michigan, meanwhile, with
an endowment of $7.57 billion,
ranked seventh in the nation for
largest endowment, and ranked
third among public institutions.
Hanlon said he is prepared to

face the vast differences between
the two institutions.
"Remember that I know Dart-
mouth," he said. "I've been there,
I've been part of that community.
I know it'll be different but I've
always liked learning things. I'm
always happiest when I'm learn-
ing new things. So I'll be learning
a new place, a new kind of envi-
ronment and I'm kind of looking
forward to that."

PROVOST
From Page 1
announced she would leave to
become president at the Univer-
sity of Virginia.
James Duderstadt, the Uni-
versity's president from 1988 to
1996 who also served as provost,
said it's critical for the provost
and president to have a strong
working relationship.
"One of the challenges, of
course, is the president and pro-
vost form a very important team,
and typically you want the presi-
dent to have a significant influ-
ence over the provost that she
or he will work with," Duder-
stadt said in an interview. "Since
(Coleman) is approaching the
end of her tenure at Michigan,
she'll probably appoint an inter-
im provost. The next permanent
provost will most likely be cho-
sen by the next president."
While the president's main
focus is generally promoting
the University externally - to
donors, government officials,
alumni and others - the provost
typically works internally and
is responsible for the Univer-
sity's academic budget and the
University's dean's report to the
provost.
"It takes a very intimate rela-
tionship between the provost
and the president to balance the
inside and the outside and to
make sure the university stays
on a stable course," Duderstadt
said. "That's why the decision of
picking a provost is very much a
decision that needs to be made
by the president."
Working in an interim capac-
ity before becoming the Uni-
versity's provost from 2002 to
2005, Paul Courant, now the
dean of libraries, said he helped
Coleman adjust to the presi-
dency when she first arrived in
Ann Arbor from the University
of Iowa in 2002.
"I was able to introduce her,
as it were, to the campus and
introduce the campus to her,"

Courant said. "I think that was
useful to her."
Courant said he had no direct
knowledge of -the search pro-
cess, but noted the candidate for
interim provost would "certain-
ly be an insider" as opposed to
someone hired from outside the
University in order to ease the
transition.
Historically, the Univer-
sity has promoted from within
whenever it chooses, a new pro-
vost. Sullivan, who came to the
University in 2006 from the
University of Texas, was the
first provost hired from outside
the University since at least the
1940s, Duderstadt said.
Because provosts at the Uni-
versity have many responsibili-
ties - serving as both the chief
academic and budgetary officer
- it's often helpful to appoint
someone to the position who
already has an understanding of
how the institution works, Dud-
erstadt said.
"(Sullivan) demonstrated
in a very convincing way that
you can come from outside and
provide able leadership," Dud-
erstadt said. "So, you certainly
don't want to rule out outside
candidates, although the tradi-
tion is that people typically look
inside for those candidates."
The nature of the provost
position at the University has
also resulted in a long history
of University provosts moving
onto presidencies, either at the
University or elsewhere.
Before Sullivan left for Vir-
ginia, former Provost Nancy
Cantor, who held the post from
1997-2001, left the University to
assume the chancellor position
at the University of Illinois and
then the presidency at Syracuse
University. Her predecessor,
Bernard Machen, left the Uni-
versity in 1997 after a tenure of
two years to become the Univer-
sity of Utah's president. After a
little more than a year as provost,
Charles Vest became president of
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1990.

Dudersdadt and former
University President Harold
Shapiro, who later served as
Princeton University's president,
are also former provosts.
While it's still unknown who
will succeed Hanlon at the Uni-
versity, the person will likely
possess skills that will make
them an attractive candidate for
an eventual presidency. How-
ever, in order to be successful as
provost, both on an interim and
permanent basis, they must have
a similar level of understanding
to Hanlon regarding the Uni-
versity's nuanced academic and
budgetary cultures, officials
said.
Ilitch praised Hanlon's atten-
tion to the University's budget:
Despite cost-cutting efforts,
Hanlon effectively kept cuts
away from most of the Univer-
sity's academic enterprises.
Similarly, Ilitch said the next
provost needs to be "a person
that has a kind of zealous com-
mitment to the quality of the
academia at the University -
quality of professors, quality of
the deans, being a strong people
person, being very disciplined
about the budget, knowing how
to balance it properly so that
quality doesn't suffer."
White emphasized Hanlon's
commitment to undergraduate
education, and said she expects
his successor to also make an
effort to improve the undergrad-
uate experience. He has taught
introductory calculus classes
and a class about the University's
budgetary process during his
time at the University."
"He's very focused on the
undergraduate educational
experience and how to take that
experience into the next century
and make sure that the classroom
is a place where students and fac-
ulty are engaged in discussions
and problem solving in ways that
are different from their standard
lecture format," White said.

TAUBMAN
From Page 1
the grievances to his supervi-
sor, Kevin Malloey, Taubman's
executive assistant. Neither were
"able to do anything to diminish,
curb or in any way change" Taub-
man's conduct, according to the
lawsuit.
Rock reportedly rejected
Taubman's actions regularly,
telling him "no," "stop," "you're
making me upset, nervous and
scared" and "you're hurting
me" along with other objections
detailed in the suit.
In 2009, Rock informed Taub-
man she was pregnant, and
he allegedly proceeded to ask
"numerous inappropriate and
unacceptable questions" regard-
ing her pregnancy. He also told
her she was gaining weight and
should have gotten an abortion,
according to the suit.
Around December 2009,
Rock's doctor told her it was
unsafe to be airborne while in

her seventh month of pregnancy.
The Taubman Company's human
resources department approved
Rock's maternity leave, which
Taubman referred to as a "long
vacation," the suit states.
After giving birth in February,
Rock was scheduled to return
to work in April 2010, but was
forced back in March. Upon her
return, Taubman allegedly told
Rock she was "selfish" to have
a baby, stressing again that she
should have had an abortion.
In February 2011, Rock went
on short-term disability leave
due to "extreme stress, anxiety,
fearfulness and depression due to
unlawful working conditions that
she was being forced to endure,"
according to the suit. During that
time, she was forced to resign,
and she currently remains out of
work.
This is not Taubman's first run
in with the law. In 2002, he was
accused of price fixing between
rival British auction houses
Christie's and 'Sotheby's, which
Taubman owned until 2005. He

was fined $7.5 million and impris-
oned for anti-trust violations for
10 months. In his autobiography
"Threshold Resistance," Taub-
man maintained his innocence,
stating his accuser lied-under
oath.
Taubman's financial contribu-
tions to the University total '$142
million, including $100 million
toward the A. Alfred Taubman
Medical Research Institute and
$30milliontotheA.Alfred Taub-
man College of Architecture and
Urban Planning. He has also
funded institutes and centers at
Harvard University, Brown Uni-
versity, Lawrence Technological
University and the College for
Creative Studies.
Forbes estimates that Taub-
man, who resides in Bloomfield
Hills, is worth $2.9 billion -
which was primarily procured
through his success in developing
the modern shopping mall.
Taubman attended the Univer-
sity of Michigan and Lawrence
Technological Institute, but did
not graduate from either school.


PROP. 2
From Page 1
The constitution was approved
by 58 percent of Michigan voters
in Nov. 2006, according to the
statement.
In his petition, Schuette said
the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals
decision eradicates the choice
made by the majority of Michigan
voters.
"More than two million Michi-
gan voters have now have been
disenfranchised of their choice
to eliminate considerations of
race in education by a one-vote
margin en banc decision that
misapplies this Court's equal-
protection precedents in several
ways," Schuette said.
Schuette added that though
the issue of affirmative action is
controversial, a court has never
denied a state the right to deter-
mine its role independently.
"This Court has said just the
opposite, holding that all racial
classification by government
entities are presumptively invalid
and subject to the strictest scru-
tiny," Schuette said.
University Law Prof. Mark
Rosenbaum, who helped argue
the 6th Circuit Court's ruling on
behalf of the plaintiffs, said he
believes the ruling should stay
in place. He said Schuette's peti-
tion to the U.S. Supreme Court is

"a disservice to the people of the
state of Michigan."
He added that the U.S.
Supreme Court should deal sole-
ly with issues that apply to the
whole country.
"The Supreme Court exists to
hear cases that are in the national
scope, and the point is that there
isn't a single other case anywhere
in the U.S. that is now going for-
ward with the issues related to
this case," Rosenbaum said.
Rosenbaum said that if Pro-
posal 2 were reinstated, diversity
at the University would suffer.
"I would set Michigan apart
from virtually every other state
throughout the country in not
being permitted to argue the fact
that race is a part of the American
mosaic," Rosenbaum said. "There
is the capacity for the political
process being open to make the
case that diversity should include
racial identity. That would be
shut down and that would be an
American tragedy."
Residential College Prof. Carl
Cohen wrote in an e-mail that
he supports Schuette because he
believes affirmative action is a
violation of the Equal Protection
Clause and the Civil RightsAct of
1964.
He added that choosing
applicants based on race would
enhance pre-existing stereotypes
and is hurtful to everyone.
"Applicants enrolled partly

because of their race will, as a
statistical matter, almost invari-
ably perform less well than those
admitted without preference,"
Cohen wrote. "The consequence
is that skin color, because of such
preference is regularly associated
with inferior performance - and
thus the old and nasty stereotype
of racial inferiority is reinforced
by preference."
He wrote that residents should
be proud that this form of racial
discrimination was eliminated in
Michigan.
LSA senior Brian Koziara, the
senior adviser to the University's
Chapter of College Republicans,
said Schuette's actions are nec-
essary to protect Michigan resi-
dents, adding that universities
should pick students based on
merit, not race.
"We should focus on filling
universities with the leaders and
the best and educating the best
minds possible so we can remain
the most competitive place in
the world," Koziara said. "Simply
cherry-picking certain demo-
graphics because we want diversi-
ty is not what we shouldbe doing."
He added that he believes the
Supreme Court will strike down
the 6th Court Circuit's ruling.
"Law is useless unless it's
applied equally to everyone,"
Koziara said. "I'm fully confident
the Supreme Court will strike it
down."

Picking the provost
Successor should follow Hanlon's example
he University received a shake-up today when Dartmouth
College announced that University Provost Philip Hanlon
was elected to serve as the school's 18th president. The
University is expected to choose an interim provost until the next
University president is chosen. The next president will then likely
choose a permanent provost. It should be expected that the inter-
im provost will maintain the high standards set by Hanlon - such
as putting an emphasis on undergraduate affairs and working to
decrease tuition rates - and look to guide the University through
changing and difficult times in the world of higher education.

Big (Star)bucks

Admit it, you enjoy nest-
ling up at Starbucks just as
much as I do. To escape the
everyday head-
aches of college,
you curl up in a
soft chair with ;
your favorite
book and holi-
day latte - away
from the anx-
iety-burdened SARAH
Hatcher Ref- SKALUBA
erence Room,
those creeping
paper deadlines
and the freezing Antarctic winds
that torment our campus each win-
ter. Although we really don't have
four dollars to throw down every
time we want a sugary, caffein-
ated espresso drink, we continue
to pay up. Our economy may be in
turmoil and the price of our tuition
an ever-increasing battle, but some-
how, some way, we still manage to
indulge ourselves with Starbucks,
Sweetwaters, Comet Coffee, you
name it.
Earlier this month, Starbucks
introduced their exclusive new Costa
Rica Finca Palmilera roast, an exclu-
sive blend of Geisha beans that sells
for a mere $7 a pop. That's right folks,
a grande cup of joe that costs $7 and
your dignity can now be found at
your neighborhood Starbucks!
But seriously, how in the world
could a single cup of coffee be
almost 10 dollars when you can buy
an entire meal for that price right
down the street at Potbelly or Noo-
dles and Company?
As an avid coffee drinker myself,
I must admit the whole thing is
absurd. Do I treat myself to a vanilla

latte every now and then? Yes. But
to expect customers to drop seven
bucks on a cup of coffee before head-
ing to class or work seems crazy. For
all I know, this could be a new trend
in coffee culture of offering a more
luxurious, exclusive roast that truly
separates the men from the boys
and the coffee connoisseurs from
the sleep-deprived college students
needing only a basic brew before
crawling to 8 a.m. lecture.
Our society today is quite liter-
ally fueled by coffee. The familiar
slogan, "American runs on Dunkin',"
proves accurate, considering more
than half of Americans over the age
of 18 drink coffee daily and not just
one, but an average of three cups
a day, according to the National
Coffee Association. So remember,
just when you thought your coffee
addiction was reaching an all-time
high this semester, chances are the
majority of the population is right
there beside you.
However, just because we rely
so heavily on caffeine to power
through the day doesn't mean we
need to throw down a casual seven
dollars every time we want a quick
caffeine fix. As late night host
Jimmy Kimmel said on his show
this week, "I feel like this is a test
to find out just how stupid we are."
Unfortunately, I'd have to concur. A
cup of joe is a cup of joe regardless
of where you buy it. Granted, that
sketchy diner down the road may
keep the same pot festering for days
on end, but when it comes down to
your average, everyday cup I don't
see a drastic difference between
the Folgers you brewed at home
and the house roast you picked up
at Amer's.

Americans foster a spending
culture. That's definitely nothing
new - just look at what transpired
on Black Friday at stores across
the nation. But at a certain point,
we, as consumers need to take a
step back and think a little more
deeply about how we're spending
our money. The average American
spends roughly $1,100 a year on
coffee, and mind you, this num-
ber doesn't include gingerbread
lattes, caramel macchiatos and
all the other guilty pleasures we
indulge in over. the holiday sea-
son. Increase the price of coffee to
seven dollars a cup, however, and
this number would skyrocket.
Separating
the coffee
elitists from
basic brewers.
Trust me, I'd be the first to jump
in line for a great brew, but not at
-such a price. Instead, let's try to
embrace the holiday spirit, shall we?
Let's replace venti lattes and luxury
cups of coffee with an average cup
of joe. Not only would your savings
account thank you, but in return,
you'd have changeleft over to donate
to that freezing Salvation Army bell-
ringer hovering outside Meijer in his
Santa suit.

Hanlon received a Bachelor of Arts degree
from Dartmouth in 1977. He will assume the
position as president of Dartmouth College on
July 1, 2013 and succeed Jim Yong Kim, who
left to become president of the World Bank
some months ago. In a campus-wide e-mail,
University President Mary Sue Coleman wrote
that she will name an interim provost in the
"upcoming weeks."
The creation of an interim position is the
best option for this time because the position of
president is also in flux as University President
Mary Sue Coleman's contract expires in 2014.
Due to the close working relationship between
the president and the provost, it would be best
if the new incoming president were given the
option of choosing the associate he or she will
be working with. vice Provost Martha Pol-
lack would be ideal for this transitory period
as a result of her close work with Hanlon. As
the head of academic budget for the University,
the provost exercises significant influence over
aspects of student life, of which tuition cost is
the most critical example.

Hanlon exemplified the best character-
istics of a provost. He was dedicated to the
undergraduate population, a characteristic
that is often undervalued at large research
universities. Hanlon has even taught under-
graduate level Calculus I classes and he and
Pollack also taught a class about the Univer-
sity's budget process this fall, which demon-
strated an important and consistent link to
students. Hanlon always put undergradu-
ates at the forefront of his administrative
agenda. He is also credited with minimiz-
ing the damage of a $47.5-million drop in
state funding in 2011. When the University's
Board of Regents voted for tuition increases
for the 2012-2013 academic year, Hanlon
said "financial aid was the highest priority
in this budget." Consequently, he pushed for
administrative aid for University students to
have a true undergraduate experience with-
out high tuition costs. The University needs
an interim, and then a permanent provost,
who continues Hanlon's example by focus-
ing on undergraduate education.

EU's debt crisis and you

With the national media focusing attention
on the United States' fiscal cliff, the European
debt crisis has dropped off our radar. While
the U.S. economy slowly recovers under
the leadership of President Barack Obama,
Europe remains in chaos. The European cri-
sis was in large part triggered by the enor-
mity of the Greek government's debt. That,
combined with the fact that Italy, Portugal
and Spain have failed to manage their own
debts, has crippled the European Union and
the euro.
As time -has passed, however, Americans
have failed to realize the significance of the
Eurozone's sovereign debt crisis in light of our
own situation.
It's time for the United States to act more
quickly and for Americans to pay closer atten-
tion, since the American economic recovery
may falter if the European debt crisis isn't
reined in.
One obstacle to managing the crisis is
European countries varied their responses.
According to the Atlantic Council, the origins
of the crisis can be traced to the "political
failure to establish credible governance for
economic and monetary policy" and the fact
that EU leaders have been more concerned
about the politics of certain issues within
their respective countries. This has led to
rigid reforms like austerity measures and
bailouts for Greece and Spain, which have
created mechanisms that will not resolve the
EU's problems.
Both these reforms will only provide tem-
porary relief, if any at all. Austerity will only
hurt social programs and increase unemploy-
ment. Countries such as Greece and Spain
will still find it difficult to pay off their debts
in the long run with the limited resources at
their disposal.
The Eurozone's economic prospects have
already been diminished by its inability to sta-
bilize the economies of its southern countries.
If the current situation continues, lenders
will be less likely to provide loans to Euro-
pean governments. As a result, a reduction of
consumer confidence and spending in Europe
will lead to further contractions in European
economies. The downward spiral of decline
in economic activity will reduce demand for

American products, pulling the U.S. economy
back toward recession.
If this crisis isn't mitigated, a weaker
Europe will mean a weaker trade partner for
the United States. According to Reuters,13 per-
cent of all U.S. exports go to EU members. If
the European crisis continues in the coming
months, trade between the EU and the United
States will decrease. This will lead to economic
contractions and higher unemployment in the
"world's biggest economic blocs," which "could
be a drag on global economic fortunes for years
to come," according to Rachel Epsteina, a pro-
fessor at the University of Denver.
So howshould Europe and the United States
react? In the coming years, they must come
up with innovative, permanent solutions as
opposed to temporary ones. Austerity mea-
sures alone won't solve anything, as cutting
vital social programs without raising any new
revenues could create further economic prob-
lems for many fragile European economies.
Like the United States, the Eurozone must use
a balanced fiscal approach to solve their prob-
lems, which will mean raising taxes and cut-
ting spending. European countries should look
at revising their tax codes as well as reforming
their banking institutions.
Obviously, it will be difficult for the United
States to influence European policymaking,
since European nations are so focused on their
internal problems. One way to tackle this prob-
lem is to fix the American banking system to
make it more difficult for banks to engage in.
risky business behavior. Once we've resolved
our own financial woes, the United States will
be able to provide guidance to Europe that
Europeans will deem credible.
It has been four years since the beginning
of the U.S. financial crisis. These years have-
been long and tough for many Americans
and Europeans. Western political leaders
must implement solutions to solve this crisis.
Clearly, much more needs to be done to resolve
Europe's debt crisis. Americans who ignore
the European debt problem do so at their own
peril. With that in mind, American media
should focus on the importance of the crisis in
the coming months.

At 2:16 a.m. on Thursday
morning, asI was just start-
ing a major assignment due
the same day, I
got a mysteri-
ous e-mail. It
opened like this:
"You've been
hearing from
your teachers
all term. Now
your teachers YONAH
want to hear LIEBERMAN
fromyou."
My eyes lit
up. My heart
skipped a beat. Some things that
immediately ran through my head:
"My teachers wantto hear from me?"
and "What an incredible opportuni-
ty!" and "Wow, I feel special."
Then I promptlymarked the email
as "Unread" and went back to work.
As students, we talk about our
classes a lot. Sometimes it's to praise
an inspiring teacher. Usually it's not.
Instead, it's to complain about
a boring lecture or an unwanted
assignment. If, god forbid, I was a sta-
tistics major, I might choose to ana-
lyze the correlation of the amount of
time spent complaining about a class
and the proximity of the due date for
the next major assignment.
But once a semester, we get our
chance to take our complaints
straight to the source. Once a
semester, we get a direct line to our
professors. And the best part? It's
totally and completely anonymous.
That's right, I'm talking about
end-of-semester course evaluations.
For a moment, let's forget about
the people who fill out course eval-
uations to say positive things about
their classes. Those students may
exist. But because they're a minor-
ity on this campus, I won't bother
writing about them since they
clearly don't matter. ,
There is, of course, the issue

of whether or not professors and
departments actually consider
our critiques. There are certain
required classes for concentra-
tions that seem to be universally
despised year-in and year-out. On
that note I simply have to say that
I trust professors. As students, we
have no other recourse.
The other side of the coin is get-
ting students to actually fill out the
evaluations. If I hadto guess, I would
say about 20 percent of campus regu-
larly fills out course evaluations and
another 15 to 20 percent of students
do themwhenparticularlymotivated
- either by complete admiration or
utter hatred. The question is: Why
doesn't most of campus take the time
to evaluate classes?
There are two reasons.
First and foremost, the timing
of the evaluations couldn't be any
worse. They open two weeks before
the first day of finals and close the
day after ourlast day of classes. For
students, that's the busiest time of
the year. We have exams to prepare
for, final projects to present, and
semester-long research papers due.
Seriously - could there be a more
poorly chosen stretch of time?
Every year, I get no less than six
e-mails from CTools reminding me
fill out the evaluations. Six! That's
more reminders than I get to "pay
the damn utilities bill, already!"
And every year I see the e-mails,
mentally remind myself to do it
later, and mark them "Unread." I
don't skip it because I don't want
to fill out the evaluation. I skip it
because I probably have a paper due
the next day or a massive project to
finish up before next week.
A second reason for the low par-
ticipation is that students have no
incentive to complete the course
evaluations. We all have opinions
to share about each of our classes
- but are we motivated enough to

actually log in to CTools and fill
out the form? The answer is almost
always no, partly because of the
horrible timing and partly because
we don't get any direct benefits
from participating - at the very
least, we get the satisfaction that
future students will-benefit.
Instructers
want to hear
from you and *
your peers.
I propose a change in a system
that's clearly not working. First,
instead of closing the evaluations
before finals begin, keep them open
until two days after the last day of
finals. This way, people can actually
get back to them once theyhave time.
Second, to encourage participa-
tion, students should only be able
to see their grades for the course
after they have filled out the evalu-
ation. Don't force everyone to com-
plete the detailed form - make the
required section a simple 10 ques-
tions on a one-to-five scale. Keep
the rest of the form intact so people
can choose to fill it out if they'd
like. It will take maybe two minutes
per course and create the personal
investment needed.
I'm not claiming to have all the
answers - these are just sugges-
tions. But it's a conversation we
need to be having. Our University
is one of the best in the world. It's
about time that our course evalua-
tion system reflects that excellence.

Volleyball holds off Vols

'M' heads to Big Rapids
looking to snap streak

By GREG GARNO
Daily Sports Writer
After cruising through its first
two sets against Tennessee, the
Michigan volleyball team ran to
its locker room like children run-
ning home for dinner.
But when Michigan returned
to play, there was a stronger,
much different opponent waiting.
The Wolverines managed to
walk away
victorious, MICHIGAN 3
overcoming TENNESSEE 2
the resur-
gent Volunteers to hang on to
their two-set lead and win a close
five-set match, 25-22,25-17,22-25,
19-25, 15-10 in the opening round
of the NCAA Tournament in Lou-
siville, Ky. With the win, Michi-
gan advances to the second round
to play No. 9 Louisville on Friday.
Thanks to a fast start in the
fifth set, the Wolverines (24-11)
were able to escape an early exit
following a strong regular season.
"I thought we did a good job
of just letting those first four sets
go, good and bad, and just play-
ing that fifth set really well," said
Michigan coach Mark Rosen.
"I'm very proud of how they
responded and looking forward
to moving on."
Michigan leaned heavily on its
leading hitters - junior outside
hitters Lexi Erwin and Molly
Toon - to take control. The two
accounted for more than half of
Michigan's points. Erwin fin-
ished with a game-high 26 kills
while Toon added 20.
The Wolverines came out
strong early, catching the Volun-
teers on their heels. Down 2-4 in
the first set, Michigan went on a
4-0 to secure a lead. Tennessee
had no answer to the Wolverines'
momentum in the beginning of
the game, unable to get a sideout
when needed.
For the rest of the set, Ten-
nessee could only answer with

Junior outside hitter Lexi Erwin finished with a game-high 26 kills as Michigan snuck past Tennessee in five sets.

one point to every two points
for Michigan, failing to stop the
Wolverines' momentum.
Strong hitting and a nearly
errorless second set allowed
Michigan to quickly head into
the locker room: The Wolverines
raced out to a 10-3 run behind
the strong play of junior middle
blocker Jennifer Cross. The Vol-
unteers never figured out how
to stop a team that hit at will, as
Michigan finished with a .300
attack percentage and only one
error.
"Jen is a student of the game
and loves to think through the
game," Rosen said. "There were
lots of times I could see her com-
municating with other players
and telling them what they're
going to do and setting our team
up to defend."
But Tennessee - 8-3 in five-
set games this season - was
accustomed to taking its time to
figure out opponents.
The Volunteers had over-
committed to one hitter by
gambling on sophomore set-
ter Lexi Dannemiller's decision

to continue feeding Erwin and
Toon. But Tennessee switched
its scheme in the following sets,
running two setters and a stron-
ger offense.
Michigan's hot hitting cooled
off following the break, ending
the set with a .108 attack per-
centage. Ahead 13-11, Tennessee
need only a 3-0 run to provide
the momentum to pull away.
The Volunteers mirrored
the Wolverines' strong second
set with one of their own in the
fourth, taking advantage of a
slew of serving errors - Michi-
gan finished with nine serving
errors on the night. Tennessee
jumped out to a 10-4 lead, mak-
ing several short runs to force
the fifth set.
"Even though Tennessee
was making a good run at us,
they were always coming from
behind," Rosen said. "I think that
still allows to be a little bit more
controlled and more composed
and know that we had the ability
to play at that level."
Added Erwin: "I think that it
was the first-game jitters, so not

everything was going as smooth
as it has gone all season. I think
we kind of just forgot the first
four games and started new."
Needing a sprint in the fifth
set, the Wolverines managed
a 6-3 on two service aces from
Dannemiller. The Volunteers
called a timeout hoping to
respond, but Michigan extended
its lead tot10-5, forcing yet anoth-
er timeout. Ultimately, using two
kills from Dannemiller, the Wol-
verines closed the game on akill
from Toon.
Dannemiller finished with
57 assists, and 16 digs as part of
her solid night. Freshman libero
Tiffany Morlaes led the team in
digs with 19, adding to her strong
freshman campaign.
"We had to learn as the match
went on," Rosen said. "I think
these guys, especially in the first
two sets, I could see them mak-
ing a lot of adjustments, just
from what they're watching. It's
something this team takes a lotof
pride on, they're good smatt vol-
leyball players, they're not just
playing the system."

The Michigan hockey team

And because

son with an
abysmal 0-3-1 TV/Radio:
record away MGoBlue.com
from Yost Ice
Arena, the venue is perhaps more
foreboding than Ferris State's sta-
tus as reigning conference cham-
pions.
To neutralize the home-ice
advantage, Michigan coach Red
Berenson said the Wolverines
(3-5-1, 5-7-1) need to get on the
board first.
"It's huge, especially at a place
like Ferris State where it feels like
the crowd is right on the ice with
you," Berenson said. "For us to
play well there, we've got to keep
the crowd out of it."
Coming off yet another embar-
rassing loss, this time to Cornell at
Madison Square Garden, Michi-
gan also needs to return to the
fundamentals. Missed defensive
assignments led to too many Big
Red goals in the 5-1 defeat last Sat-
urday.
"It wasn't that (Cornell) made
great plays," Berenson said.
"These were broken plays. We're
not picking up sticks or doing sim-

ple things like that."
The Bulldogs sit in a tie for sec-
ond place in the league, and one
reason is because they've retained
their stellar goaltending. Last
year, sophomore C.J. Motte split
time between the pipes duringhis
with then-senior Taylor Nelson,
but now the job is Motte's alone.
He's posted a 2.20 goals-against
average and a save percentage of
.928.
In order to begin a crucial four-
game stretch of games leading up
to the Great Lakes Invitational
on the right foot, the Michigan
offense needs to find its scoring
touch. After scoring in bunches to
start the season, the Wolverines
have scored one goal apiece in
three of their last four games.
"Right now, goals for are pre-
cious and goals against are killing
us," Berenson said.
, But as he does every year,
Berenson recently looked back at
the team's first 10 games to evalu-
ate where it stands. What he found
was that goals scored, power-play
goals and shots against were all
similar to their totals from a year
ago. The main discrepancy came
in goals against. The Bulldogs
won't be the best offensive team
the Michigan defense has faced all
year, but they are still formidable.
Ferris State ranks third in the
CCHA, averaging 2.88 goals per
game.
"I think it's just our defensive-
zone coverage that's struggling
right now," said freshman defen-
seman Jacob Trouba. "It's just
something we need to keep work-
ing on in practice."
The defensemen have been
slow-footed so far, but the burden
also lies with the backchecking
forwards.
If Ferris State gets on the board
first, the Wolverines will have a
hard time digging out of the hole
at Ewigleben Arena.

Wolverines travel to Peoria in first true road game

Over the last week, the No. 3
Michigan basketball team played
two games in the famed Madison
Square Garden, won its first-ever
NIT Season Tip-Off and beat its
first ranked opponent of the sea-
son. And all three of those games
were on ESPN
in front of a
national audi- Michigan

It's difficult
to judge a team Matchup:

opponents like

or Cleveland day, 4 p.m.
State. Last Where:
week, the Wol- Carver Arena
verines went TV/Radio:
unscathed in MGoBlue.com
their biggest
stretch of the
young season, and it gets easier to
judge them when they play teams
like Pittsburgh and then-No.18
North Carolina State.
But this weekend, Michigan
gets a break from major-con-
ference teams. On Saturday, the
Wolverines travel to Peoria, Ill. to
take on Bradley, a team that went
7-25 in the less-than-illustrious
Missouri Valley Conference last
season.
It's Michigan's first true road
game of the year - the preseason
tournament last week was tech-
nically at a neutral site - but
Bradley has also never hosted a
non-conference opponent with

this high of a ranking in its his-
tory. You'd have to go back to 1982
to find the last time the Braves
played a team ranked top-three
nationally.
Bradley (5-1) finishes off the
month tied for the most Novem-
ber wins in program history, so
it's not like the Braves are in the
midst of a terrible season. Their
entire starting five is averaging
double-digits in points, and a
sixth player is averaging close to
nine.
Still, Michigan is expected
blow by this team without a prob-
lem. It's the No. 3 team in the
country against a team that has
wins over Upper Iowa and Texas-
Pan American among others. Ten
points and a hat tip to anyone that
can name those mascots.
There is the possibility of a let-
down game, just as there is a pos-
sibility of a letdown game when
any highly-ranked team plays a
mid-major on the road. This is
Bradley's biggest game ofthe year
- you can count on the building
being full and the Braves to come
out with some energy.
But Bradley, a private univer-
sity with 5,300 undergraduate
students, and Michigan, a public
university with 27,400 under-
graduate students, don't have
much in common.
The biggest similarity came
from a common opponent from
the middle of November - Indi-
ana University-Purdue Univer-
sity Indianapolis. Michigan won
that game by 37, Bradley beat the
Jaguars by seven.

Michigan coach John Beilein and the Wolverines are off to a 6-0 start and are coming off a 79-72 victory over No.18 N.C. State at Crisler Center.

After sufferinga defeat in the
courtroom Tuesday night, the
Central Student Government
took a second blow early Friday
morning after the referendum
it fought to keep off the ballot
showed that a majority of stu-
dents who voted in Rackham
Student Government's election
support pursuing secession from
CSG.
RSG reported that 9.5percent
of Rackham students, approxi-
mately 800 students, voted in
the election, with 719 students
voting on the referendum. Of
those voters, 69 percent sup-
ported pursuing secession.
While 9.5 percent of students
equates to roughly 1 in 10 Rack-
ham students voting, only 6.4
percent of LSA students and 2.5
percent of Engineering students

ter of intent for federal-state
cooperation in the creation
of an exchange, according to
Kurt Weiss, a spokesman from
the Michigan Department of
Technology, Management and
Budget, which helps the state
implement various projects and
initiatives.
Wednesday's decision by the
committee does not change his
commitment in the letter to the
federal government, Weiss said.
"We're going to continue
down the path of the partnership
exchange," he said.
The bill failed in committee

voting against the measure.
On Tuesday, with RSG's elec-
tion already a day underway,
RSG defended its ballot question
after CSG filed an injunction
against RSG on Nov. 21. The suit
addressed the ballot question
as well as additional issues, and
the injunction was separated,
meaning a second hearing will
take place in the near future to
address less-timely issues listed
on the injunction.
However, portions of the suit
arguing that the non-binding
question should be kept off the
ballot were dismissed by the CSJ
after a three-hour hearing.
While the ballot question was
submitted by RSG and secession
has been spearheaded by the
graduate student body, others
are also in favor of its secession.
Law student Liz Och, the
president of the Law School Stu-
dent Senate, said in an October
interview she favored looking
into creating an all-graduate

than undergraduate students,
some have families and very few
utilize on-campus housing.
"In terms of regular day-
to-day issues that are faced by
undergrads, we don't experience
a lot of those," she said.
Och, who is also pursuing
a master's degree through the
School of Natural Resources and
the Environment, said an all-
graduate student government
could foster more collaboration
between the graduate schools.
"It's not really about the
money;" Och said. "Obviously
the money is important, but I
think that it's more the sense
of community that should come
from having a smaller gradu-
ate student government that's
more focused around what (Law
School students) ... actually care
about."
In addition to gauging student
interest in secession, the elec-
tion also resulted in the selec-
tion of 12 RSG board members.

RSG: 69 percent
of voters support a

The Central Student Gov-
ernment released unofficial
results of its November elec-
tions a little more than 12 hours
after polls closed Wednesday at
11:59 p.m., but announced it will
reschedule the election for the
eight Rackham representative
seats after a faulty ballot only
allowed students to vote for one
candidate.
LSA senior Lukas Garske,
CSG student general counsel,
wrote in an e-mail to candi-
dates that CSG reopened the
ballot midday on Thurday and
Rackham students will have
an additional 48 hours to vote
on Rackham representatives
before polls close at 11:59 p.m.
on Saturday.
Garske also acknowledged
an error in the ballot for LSA
assembly representative, but
said it ultimately had no bear-

ing on the election's outcome.
"We also received reports
of an error in the LSA elec-
tions, which allowed students
to rank three candidates, while
only two seats were vacant on
the Assembly," Garske wrote.
"After conferring with ITS, it
was determined this error did
not affect the results."
Results from the LSA Student
Government and University of
Michigan Engineering Council
elections were released short-
ly after their respective polls
closed early Thursday morn-
ing, similar to the results of
last November's CSG elections.
CSG violated its own Compiled
Code, releasing its results after
the 12 p.m. Thursday deadline,
albeit only by six minutes.
Even the results of the
March elections, which saw
unprecedented turnout and
election complaints, were
released within the 12-hour
window their Compiled Code
requires.
In addition to the now-void
Rackham ballots, students
voted on 10 other open posi-
tions: assembly representative
positions from LSA, the College
of Engineering, the School of
Natural Resources, the College

of Architecture, the School of
Dentistry, the School of Public
Health, the School of Education
and a position on the Depart-
ment of Public Safety Oversight
Commission.
Though November CSG elec-
tions are meant to fill vacancies
in the assembly, not all seats
voted upon are vacant - some
were temporarily filled after
the resignation or dismissal of
a member and others never had
an attending holder.
Newly elected representa-
tives include: Daniel Glick-
Unterman, a College of
Architecture and Urban Plan-
ning junior; LSA junior Chris
Mays, Division of Public Safety
and Security Oversight Com-
mittee representative; seniors
Sriram Yarlagadda and Gavin
Lim and sophomore Michael
Hatty, representatives from
the College of Engineering;
sophomore Robert Dishell and
senior Brian Koziara, LSA rep-
resentatives; Lior Aljadeff, rep-
resentative from the School of
Dentistry; Emma Howland-
Bolton, representative from
the School of Education; and
Desiree McLain, representa-
tive from the School of Public
Health.

partially because of Republican
resistance to the Affordable Care
Act and partially because state
Republicans used what is called
a "tie bar" to link the decision on
the exchange to the fate of anti-
abortion bills in the state Legis-
lature, said state Rep. Kate Segal
(D-Battle Creek), the House
Democratic floor leader.
Even if the committee passed
the health care exchange bill, the
bill would not be implemented if
two anti-abortion bills do not
pass state law due to the tie bar,
Segal said.
"Republicans refuse to
acknowledge the Affordable
Care Act is here to stay, and
they're putting politics in front
of what's best for Michigan,"

Segal said. "They further tied
politics to it by trying to make it
an anti-abortion bill that has no
consideration for the life and the
safety of the mother."
Some state Republicans met
the committee's decision on
Wednesday with disappointment
over the loss of an opportunity
to fully control an institution
imposed on them by the federal
government.
"It was my hope the commit-
tee would find that a state-run
exchange afforded us more con-
trol over the unacceptable over-
reach by the federal government
regarding the health care of
Michigan citizens," state Speak-
er of the House Jase Bolger (R-
Marshall) said in a statement.

He added: "After due dili-
gence, however, it is clear that
there were too many unan-
swered questions for the com-
mittee to feel comfortable with a
state-run exchange."
Michigan Attorney General
Bill Schuette said in a statement
on Wednesday that he was wor-
ried about the federal-state part-
nership, calling the exchange
"an extremely complex issue" in
which "many unanswered ques-
tions still remain."
"I have always had grave con-
cerns about establishing a health
care exchange," Schuette said in
the statement.
The bill rejected by the com-
mittee passed in the state Sen-
ate on Nov. 10. At the meeting

of the committee in Lansing on
Wednesday morning, it drew
praise and criticism from the
public over the course of an
hour-long open session.
One opponent of the exchange,
Isabelle Terry, a resident of
Rockford, Mich., wrote to the
committee to opine that the
Affordable Care Act "put us on
an horrifying track to financial
ruin."
Matthew Davis, an associate
professor of internal medicine at
the University's Medical School,
said Medicaid is an example of
a successful federal-state part-
nership, and indicates a similar
partnership on health care could
be effective.
Davis said a federal-state

partnership could help Uni-
versity students find their own
health insurance, a particularly
beneficial criterion for students
now as their parents' employers
are less likely to offer health care
benefits.
He expected Snyder and the
federal government to work out
the details of the exchanges over
the next -few months and the
deadline to implement them is
October 2013.
Weiss said Snyder was com-
mitted to the partnership
exchanges as the best possible
option for the state.
"I certainly think it's fair
to say that Governor Snyder
believes that the partnership
approach can work," he said.

The pairiting reminded Prasad

I got from other group members

different textures and colors to
more tangible objects so that
the painting does become more
relatable."
For instance, one section of
the- painting reminded a fel-
low "Many Voices" filmmaker
of spreading peanut butter

Prasad's film.

Lisa Borgsdorf, manager of

some of the "Many Voices" film-
makers plan to take a documen-
tary approach, while others will
use the art as a starting point for
a film that veers in a totally dif-
ferent direction. She feels that
the project will not only benefit
the participants but also enrich
the experience of the gallery's
visitors.
Borgsdorf hopes the proj-
ect benefits artists as well as
enhances the gallery's visitors.
"We think of it as a little tri-
angle," she said. "There's the
work of art, there's the video
and then there's the visitor who
is experiencing both. (We try)
to remember all three of those
in the creative process as we are
developing ideas."
The finished films will be vis-
ible through QR codes located
near the works of art in the
UMMA gallery that visitors can
scan with smartphones. They
will also be available for view-
ing at the UMMA's dialog table,

telling and dynamic learning.

TV NOTEBOOK
Intimate moments, characters
impress in fearless 'Parenthood'

By RADHIKA MENON
DailyArts Writer
Need I express my love for
"Friday Night Lights" for you
all? Anyone who knows me
knows that I can't say enough
about the show - literally, I
won't shut up about it. With its
gritty and sincere storytelling
coupled with its magnificent
cast's acting chops, executive
producer and head writer Jason
Katims created something truly
spectacular, even though it was
only enjoyed bya handful of peo-
pie. But this isn't an article about
"Friday Night Lights." Rather,
it's about Ratims's next project:
the equally impressive "Parent-
hood."
I stumbled upon "Parenthood"
completely by accident. Caught in
deep depression after my beloved
"Friday Night Lights" ended its
fantastic five-season run, I was

most clearly in the form of cross-

with characters that are intricate-

so far is Lauria's addition in sea-

- a nice nod to viewers of both
shows about Luke Cafferty's fate.
"Parenthood" is fearless in
tackling life's difficult obstacles:
There are no second thoughts
about delving into the difficulties
of living with Asperger's Syn-

job or facing a life-threatening
illness like cancer. In fact, the
writers of "Parenthood" welcome

these hurdles and subsequently
write a perfect story arc that is
complemented by truly moving
performances from the cast.
Take, for example, the bur-
geoning storyline in the current
fourth season. In the second
episode, "Left Field," Kristina
Braverman (Monica Potter)
finds out that she has a cancer-
ous tumor growing in her breast.
Cancer arcs can often be overly
dramatic and trite, but "Parent-

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Life-changing moments
at music festivals

Criticizing the
criticism of
electronic pop
By GREGORY HICKS
Daily Arts Writer
"(Insert modern music genre
here) is not real music!" shouts
19-year-old music expert John
Smith in his Musicology 101 class.
This is one of the most common
phrases to ever be uttered, heard
and overheard. Musical style
changes every decade, and with
those changes comes the same
argument.
Let's dispel the not-real-music
theory. A brilliant way to sum-
marize this concept comes from
musicologist Jean-Jacques Nat-
tiez, who said in his book "Music
and Discourse" that "the bor-
der between music and noise
is always culturally defined -
which implies that, even within
a single society, this border does
not always pass through the same
place; in short, there is rarely a
consensus."
Rarely a consensus indeed,
Mr. Nattiez. People have become
much too picky about their art.
Music is a genre that mostly deals
with pitches and rhythms, so to
say that something loses its art-
istrybecause ofa change in medi-
um - the medium being sound
- is silly.
"Electronic instrumentation
makes all music sound the same!"
bellows Katie Johnson, a listen-
er who only needs to hear two
whole songs on an album before
coming to a unique conclusion
like this. It seems as though many
people todayare gifted like Katie.
But something doesn't line up
here. If computerized instrumen-
tation has given artists access
to an almost infinite number of
new instruments, then why has
it become monotonous? It hasn't.
But the artists have, and that's
where the confusion appears.
Back in the day, a person could
expect jazzy pop from Frank
Sinatra and some rock from Sting
and the Police. Translate this
into the modern day. It would be
ridiculous if someone said, "Hey!
There was a saxophone in Frank
Sinatra's other song too. All of his
stuff sounds the same." Society
has become so spoiled by the new
abundance of possible sounds in
music that it has come to expect
no two sounds to be remotely
similar.
This drives music artists like
Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears

holder) is working at living day-
to-day with Asperger's Syn-
drome. In the sixth episode of
this season, "I'll Be Right Here,"
Max speaks honestly about his
autism, highlighting the ways
in which he struggles and suc-
ceeds at everyday tasks. Itsounds
like an after-school special, but
it's not: It's an eleven-year-old
enlightening us about a very real
disorder.
Hidden in these intense
moments are treasures that
depict an extended family that
will always have each other's
back, even though they usually

aren't on the same page. There
are family road trips, spousal
spats and times of young love
and heartbreak, all of which is
so beautifully acted and filmed,
it feels as though these events
have really occurred; that we too
are members of the Braverman
family.
I could go on and on about
poignant moments in "Parent-
hood," but I think the point is
clear. Unlike many other shows,
it doesn't exist to cause contro-
versy or be soap operatic in any
sense of the phrase. But it takes
similar concepts (romance,
heartbreak and adultery to name
a few) and discusses them on a
more humanistic level. A funda-
mental aspect of "Parenthood"
is its ability to convey ordinary
familial activities as just that,
without the flare that television
usually adds.
Take it from me: It's the best
show you're not watching.

Four out of five dentists recommend Crest instead of "a bottle of Jack."

and Ke$ha to end up with 50 peo-
ple trying to write and produce
their albums. Each song ends up
sounding completely different
from the next, making it hard to
distinguish the style that the art-
ist is going for - thereby, ironi-
cally, becoming pooled together.
"I have microphones and com-
puter software, so I don't even
need a record deal to make my
music!" says Cindy Lou Who
in excitement. "She has micro-
phones and computer software,
so she doesn't even need a record
deal to make her music," says her
friend Steve in horror when asked
about tone-deaf Cindy. America
is praised as the land of opportu-
nity, but there appears to be noth-
ing but complaint with regard to
the opportunities technology has
given to famous American music
artists. Words like "Auto-Tune,"
"overproduced" and "crap" are
often associated with artists who
have jumped on the electronic
bandwagon.
Auto-Tune is not some magical
gift from the gods that morphs
a person into a talented singer.
Think about the bigger picture.
The different bells and whis-
tles heard in songs are a typical
means to an end for supporting
someone's most notable qualities.
Katy Perry is a pretty face, Brit-
ney Spears is a performer (better
or worse at times) and Ke$ha is a
talented songwriter - even if you
don't always hear it.
These seem like poor excuses
for being a mediocre singer, but
here's the long-forgotten truth:
Musical artists were never the
greatest singers. Nobody listens
to the Beatles and says, "Damn,
those are some powerhouse
vocalists." They're great song-
writers and instrumentalists, but
not so heavy on the voices. Think
back to rock 'n' roll and real-
ize the voice was degraded long

before technology came around.
"This song reminds me of this
song, which sounds like this song
and that song," Preston Weaston
comments after spending too
much time on Pandora. Admit-
tedly, there is some truth in that
the producer has become the new
instrumentalist, thanks to the
disappearance of tangible instru-
ments in a track. There are many
famous music producers out
there, each with their own dis-
tinct sound. Timbaland has his
dark, thumping beats while Dr.
Luke has his mix of guitar with a
light dubstep. When the distinct
sound of a producer is heard on
the albums of six different artists
though, alot of fingers will point
to say that one singer is copying
the other.
Even though there's access to
an infinite number of potential
noises, they don't just fall out
of the sky. People work to engi-
neer them, and when it comes
to finding out what fits with a
song, there's a lot of throwing
paint against the wall to see what
sticks.
There's the additional element
of finding a singer's voice that fits
with the electronic style. Selena
Gomez is a good example of an
artist whose voice must be beaten
to death with processing effects
before it blends in with the genre.
And Rihanna is an example of a
voice that needs very little tam-
pering to fit in.
It's much more common for
a person to pick up an actual
instrument during their lifetime
than it is to generate electronic
music. Regardless, there is alarge
amount of effort involved and the
charts continually indicate that
people enjoy listening to it, so cut
down onthe "deathofmusic" and
"horrible quality" comments. Art
is already too full of opinions imi-
tating facts.

By ANDREW ECKHOUS
Daily Arts Writer
"48 inches, that's four feet! You
grew four inches this year!" my
pediatrician jubilantly informed
me. "You're so much taller than
I remember!"
That day at the doctor's office
was the first time I really thought
about change. I didn't feel any
bigger, but now this crazy lady
was telling me I was four inches
taller than last year? When had
my bones decided to start elon-
gating themselves, and how
hadn't I noticed?
I came up with a master plan
to catch my radius and ulna in
the act. I was going to mount a
camera above my bed and record
myself sleeping every night. If
I could capture my life on film,
then I could go back, watch it and
actually see myself grow, right?
My mom didn't much like that
idea. She told me that growth
was a slow process, and that the
changes were so minute that
they'd be impossible to see.
"Life isn't like a cartoon,
Andrew," she lectured. "Your
legs don't just extend in the mid-
dle of the night. I promise."
I was skeptical of her self-
proclaimed expertise. After all,
I didn't hear the doctor tell-
ing her that she had grown four
inches. She was probably jealous
that I was growing so quickly.
Unfortunately though, my mea-
ger earnings from raking the
leaves weren't going to cover my
astronomical camera costs, and
I decided to get really into Poke-
mon instead.
Years later, I find myself think-
ing about change again. My
growth in inches has come to a
halt, but as a person, I feel a little
less childish. By no means am I an
adult yet - my unmade bed, over-
flowing pile of dirty laundry and
