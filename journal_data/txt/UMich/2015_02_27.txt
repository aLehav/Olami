“The Team” VP 
nominee attended 
trip that caused 

$85,000 in damages

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

LSA sophomore Matt Fidel, The 

Team’s candidate for Central Stu-
dent Government vice president, 
participated in a ski trip during 
which members of his fraternity 
Sigma Alpha Mu, as well as soror-
ity Sigma Delta Tau, reportedly 
caused at least $85,000 in dam-
ages, campaign manager Jacob 
Abudaram, an LSA junior, con-
firmed to The Michigan Daily last 
week.

Last month, over Martin Luther 

King, Jr. weekend, several ski trips 
hosted by six University Greek life 
chapters caused over $100,000 
in damage to two Michigan ski 
resorts and were suspended by 
their national chapters. The par-
ticipants are also facing an inves-
tigation by the Michigan State 
Police, and the possibility of Uni-
versity sanctions.

Last month, CSG collaborated 

with both the Interfraternity 
Council and the Panhellenic Asso-
ciation to release a public apology 

on behalf of the Greek organiza-
tions involved in the incident.

Abudaram, Fidel and running 

mate Will Royster, an LSA junior 
and CSG presidential candidate, 
agreed to an interview with the 
Daily on Wednesday night with 
the knowledge that it would 
include discussion of the incident.

Prior to the interview, Abuda-

ram and Fidel both told the Daily 
that there would be questions 
Fidel could not answer specifically 
about the involvement of his fra-
ternity for legal reasons, but that 
he would discuss his own senti-
ments about the incident.

Upon being told the Daily would 

still like to ask questions about 
Fidel’s involvement in the incident, 
with the understanding that Fidel 
and Royster could decline to com-
ment whenever they deemed nec-
essary, Abudaram told a reporter 
they would leave the interview if 
those questions were asked.

Until the reporter agreed not to 

ask questions about Fidel’s indi-
vidual involvement, Abudaram 
and Fidel would not continue the 
interview.

Fidel, who also serves on the 

Social Responsibility Committee 
for SAM, did comment on the fall-
out of the trip overall. However, 
he said the ski trip incident was 
shameful, and not characteristic of 

“Take Back the X” 

draws students 
and alumni to 

Rackham

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

When he started to speak 

Thursday 
inside 
Rackham 

Amphitheatre, Lester Spence 

choked up and wiped tears from 
his eyes. As one of the speakers 
in “Taking Back the X, Bringing 
Back the Love,” Spence, an asso-
ciate professor at Johns Hop-
kins University, helped wrap up 
the University’s series of Black 
History Month events. Spence 
said this experience was an 
emotional one, because he felt 
so personally connected to the 
University.

The event took place on the 

third anniversary of Trayvon 

Martin’s death, and the group 
acknowledged a moment of 
silence in his honor.

Fifteen University groups col-

laborated to organize the event, 
which included storytelling and 
singing, and featured five alum-
ni keynote speakers.

In addition to Spence, speak-

ers included Melba Joyce Boyd, 
distinguished professor of Afri-
cana Studies at Wayne State 
University; Gerloni Cotton, a 
law student at University of 

California, Los Angeles; Domi-
nique Mathews, a Detroit-based 
poet; L’Heureux Lewis-McCoy, 
associate professor at City Col-
lege of New York; and Rackham 
student Austin McCoy.

McCoy said the “Taking Back 

the X” event means something 
different to each individual, but 
for him, his focus was on the 
human rights leader Malcolm X 
and considering ways to rethink 
his legacy in the context of 

Medicare, Medicaid 
to cover CT scans 

for high-risk 

patients

By JACKIE MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

After a push led by a Univer-

sity professor, the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services 
finalized 
coverage 
guidelines 

this February for individuals at 
high risk for developing lung can-
cer, allowing them the ability to 
receive lung-screening CT scans 
with no co-pay.

CMS is the federal agency that 

administers Medicaid and Medi-
care.

Annual lung screenings will be 

available to patients ages of 55-77 
and have an extensive smoking 
history. However, doctors will 
have the final say in deciding 
who are appropriate candidates 
to undergo the testing. If testing 
is considered appropriate, then 
patients must also undergo smok-
ing cessation counseling.

Radiology Prof. Ella Kazer-

ooni, the director of Cardiotho-
racic Radiology, has been on the 
forefront of the race to get these 
screening approved by the CMS.

Students impacted 

by expanded 

options to defer 

deportation

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

Earlier this month, a federal 

court stalled an expansion of 
an executive order that would 
have expanded the provisions 
for some undocumented immi-
grants to remain in the country 
— including some students.

President 
Barack 
Obama 

announced his intention to issue 
an expansion of the Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arriv-
als policy in November. DACA, 
first introduced by the Obama 
administration in 2012, allowed 
undocumented 
immigrants 

brought to the United States 
before the age of 16, legally or 
illegally, to delay deportation. It 
also provided the opportunity to 
acquire work authorization.

The expansion was set to 

take place on Feb. 18, but fol-
lowing a challenge filed by 26 
states, including Michigan, U.S. 
District Judge Andrew Hanen 
issued a preliminary injunction 
against the executive order Feb. 
16. The lawsuit charged that 

the proposed changes extended 
beyond constitutional executive 
power.

In his injunction, Hanen 

pointed to procedural, rather 
than 
strictly 
constitutional 

issues.

“(The Court) hereby finds 

that at least Texas has satisfied 
the necessary standing require-
ments that the defendants have 
clearly legislated a substantive 
rule without complying with the 
procedural requirements under 
the Administration Procedure 
Act,” he wrote.

The proposed DACA expan-

sion would have widened the 
age range eligible for DACA, 
which currently only applies to 
individuals who arrived in the 
United States before 2007, to 
individuals in the country since 
2010. Additionally, it would have 
removed an eligibility cap of 30 
years, and extended the deferred 
action period from two to three 
years. The executive order also 
allowed parents of U.S. citizens 
and lawful permanent residents 
to request deferred action, as 
well as employment authoriza-
tion.

residents vote to 
honor theorist 
Edward Said

By IAN DILLINGHAM

Daily Staff Reporter

Nearly one year ago, stu-

dents from the UM Divest 
movement hung a sign on the 
door of Central Student Gov-
ernment chambers as part of a 
weeklong protest to occupy the 
room. The sign read “Edward 

Said Lounge” — homage to 
the 
prominent 
Palestinian-

American literary theorist and 
academic, Edward Said. As the 
protests ended, the sign was 
removed.

Thursday night, at a dedi-

cation ceremony for the new 
Edward Said Lounge on the 
third floor of the North Quad 
Residence Hall, LSA junior 
Tala Dahbour, co-chair of Stu-
dents Allied for Freedom and 
Equality, held back tears as she 
unrolled the sign once again.

“This 
sign 
was 
painted 

almost a year ago by Arab and 
Muslim students during a time 

when they felt very unsafe on 
this campus,” Dahbour said. 
“It’s a very proud moment to 
be here at a time when we don’t 
have to paint it on a piece of 
paper.”

While many racial and eth-

nic groups on campus have 
multicultural and minority-
cultural lounges — including

Digital Innovation 
Greenhouse will 
facilitate faculty, 

staff projects

By COLLEEN HARRISON

For the Daily

As digital education moves to 

the forefront of innovation ini-
tiatives on college campuses, the 
University has launched a new 
digitally minded program this 
semester.

The Digital Innovation Green-

house will push to facilitate 
growth in academic software on 
campus.

In January, the University’s 

Third Century Initiative’s Trans-
formation Grant awarded $1.4 
million to the Digital Education 
and Innovation department to 
form DIG. The funding from the 
grant covers three years of work, 

which will allow the greenhouse 
to work on initiatives such as 
opening up data about courses 
to students, improving online 
tutoring efforts like the E2Coach 
program, and helping academic 
advisers assist students through 
Student Explorer Advising.

By using these programs, 

Rachel Neimer, assistant direc-
tor for the Center for Research 
on Learning and Teaching and 
DIG’s Communities of Practice 
team lead, said she hopes teach-
ers will better be able to assist 
students through new programs.

“I think this is an exciting 

way to create new tools to help 
instructors with the most chal-
lenging part of their teaching,” 
Neimer said.

Physics Prof. Timothy McKay, 

DIG principal investigator, said 
one of the main focuses of DIG is 
to focus on bringing digital inno-
vation and data-driven programs 
to full-scale implementation, as 
opposed to scattered use across 

the University.

While the University staff and 

faculty members behind pro-
grams like E2Coach or Student 
Explorer would like to have them 
available to everyone, they don’t 
currently have the capacity to do 
so on their own.

“They build something that 

works, they test it out in that 
class, they show that it’s effec-
tive, and then they start to talk 
about it,” McKay said. “When 
they talk about it, everyone else 
wants to use it. (The) problem is 
that (the) faculty member isn’t 
really here to make a tool like 
that available to everyone on 
campus.”

Through DIG, McKay said he 

hopes the programs will grow 
from limited availability to hav-
ing nearly unlimited ability.

While DEI’s home sits on the 

eighth floor of Hatcher Gradu-
ate Library, DIG will have a lab 
on Washington St. McKay said 
he envisioned DIG as a step in 
between the initial creation of a 
project and its implementation.

“The purpose of the Digital 

Innovation Greenhouse is to take 
things from innovators and grow 
them up to maturity, to provide 
the support that’s needed to do 
that, to have the right kind of 
interaction between developers 
and users to make sure that as 
they develop it, it gets better,” he 
said.

James 
DeVaney, 
assistant 

vice provost for Digital Educa-
tion and Innovation, said while 
the program currently focuses 
on the innovators and making it 
easier for teachers to help stu-
dents, he wants to emphasize 
creating a community that incor-
porates student voices in a num-
ber of ways.

“Will students be involved?” 

he said. “Yes, as developers, as 
interns, as personalization fel-
lows to support the kinds of proj-
ects the greenhouse is focusing 
on initially.”

Mike Daniel, DEI director of 

policy and operations, said the 

New program seeks to promote

‘U’ study finds similar addictive 
properties in junk food, drugs

Researchers 
hope to change 

marketing practices 
aimed at children 

By SANJAY REDDY 

For the Daily

Despite efforts to curtail fast 

food consumption in the Unit-
ed States, junk food remains 
in popular demand — and new 
University research released 
last week suggests this resil-
ience is in part due to the nature 
of the foods themselves.

In a recently published paper 

in the Public Library of Science, 
University 
researchers 
con-

firmed that highly processed 
foods, or foods with added fats 
or refined carbohydrates such 
as flour and sugar, have addic-
tive effects.

Researchers 
found 
these 

effects work similarly to those 
of common addictive drugs. 
Unprocessed 
foods, 
without 

added fats or refined carbo-
hydrates, such as salmon and 
brown rice, were not associated 
with addictive properties in the 
study.

This research suggests that 

highly processed foods may 
have effects in the brain that are 
very similar to those brought 
about by drugs like alcohol 
and nicotine, said Assistant 
Psychology Prof. Ashley Gear-
hardt, a co-author of the study.

“The reward system in the 

brain that is triggered by these 
drugs may be triggered in the 
same way by highly processed 
foods,” she said.

This study has several far-

reaching implications, accord-
ing to Rackham student Erica 
Schulte, a lead author of the 
study. From a public aware-
ness 
standpoint, 
greater 

understanding of the addictive 
elements of highly processed 
foods could help bring about 
policy changes that discourage 
its consumption.

Furthermore, Schulte said 

the results could help change 
the nature of marketing for 
highly processed foods, partic-
ularly with regarding children.

“Currently we see market-

ing to children that is unique to 
these highly processed, addic-
tive foods,” she said. “We think 
that this study could illustrate 
how harmful it is to get kids 
hooked on these foods at such 
an early age.”

Gearhardt said the study 

could also help change the 
negative stigma that often sur-
rounds people who are strug-
gling to eat healthy and lose 
weight.

“Currently the narrative is 

that when people struggle to 
lose weight, they are not trying 
hard enough,” she said. “What 
is misunderstood is that there 
is an actual addictive process 
going on.”

Business sophomore Steph-

anie Fotouhi, a member of 
PULSE, a health and wellness 
student organization sponsored 
by the University Health Ser-
vice, said she thought the new 
findings will give both students 
and faculty a better sense of the 
challenges faced by those fac-
ing eating disorders.

“If we can spread the word 

about this, then our classmates 
who are struggling with eating 
addiction can feel better about 
themselves and receive the 
right attention and treatment,” 
she said.

Gearhardt and Schulte said 

future research will seek to 
investigate 
specific 
ingredi-

ents in highly processed foods 
that bring out certain genetic 
risk factors or vulnerabilities to 
trigger an addictive response.

greenhouse is currently in the 
process of hiring its staff, and 
plans to begin work in the fall.

Overall, Niemer said, the 

greenhouse is a logical next 

step in aiding student teach-
ing and learning, especially at a 
large-scale university.

“One of the things we know 

about the science of learning 
is that personalized feedback 
really helps learning,” she said. 
“And it’s just really hard to do in 
a large class.”

today’s society.

“I think when it came to 

issues of racism in this coun-
try, he wasn’t the sort of opti-
mism that MLK was and his 
way of dealing with racism, it 
meant on the one hand calling 
out white supremacy whenever 
he could, but then also making 
sure that Black people were 
organized,” McCoy said.

In his talk, McCoy touched 

on the importance of the histo-
ry of racial issues in the United 
States. He also said students 
need to think radically about 
activism and he encouraged 
them not to make compromises 
when addressing racial issues.

Elizabeth James, a program 

associate from the Depart-
ment of Afroamerican and 
African studies, said she likes 
that “Taking Back the X” is an 
event open for interpretation. 
She said the significance of 
the event’s title is rooted in the 
historical meaning of the let-
ter X, particularly in relation 
to her ancestors’ obligation to 
sign their names with an X.

“The fact that we were tak-

ing (the X) back was the sense 
that we were reclaiming our 
ancestors and really paying 
homage to the fact that there 
are those that come before us, 
and it’s important to recognize 
and to let them offer wisdom to 
our current students,” James 
said.

Many 
of 
the 
speakers, 

including Cotton and Spence, 
emphasized the importance 

of Black community. Spence 
focused on solidarity and the 
need to build community at the 
University and elsewhere.

“The political battles and 

the political trials that we 
have, 
they’re 
exciting 
and 

they can be tiring too, but they 
won’t sustain you,” Cotton 
said. “What will really sustain 
you is the people that you’re in 
that battle with.”

In tandem with this idea, 

most of the speakers said there 
is a vibrant Black community 
at the University and acknowl-
edged the importance of Black 
student groups, such as the 
Black Student Union and move-
ments like #BBUM.

LSA 
freshman 
Gloriela 

Iguina-Colón said as a Puerto 
Rican she felt a sense of com-
munity at the event as a minor-
ity, noting a lot of the stories 
told will stick with her for a 
long time.

“I came mainly because I 

feel like the recent movements 
on campus have been really 
important,” Iguina-Colón said.

James said engaging stu-

dents and alumni on campus is 
key for building a community 
and increasing education on 
these issues.

“We do a lot of talking about 

UM leaders and best, and if 
we’re forging these new voices 
to go out into the world, and 
if we’re going to be working 
to empower and invigorate 
and create a better world, we 
have to start here,” James said. 
“College campuses have bright 
young minds that are open to 
looking at things in a different

there’s definitely a public health 
need to try and reduce mortal-
ity from lung cancer. Lung can-
cer screening with CT is aimed 
at doing that at the population 
health level.”

Kazerooni was an investiga-

tor for the 2011 National Lung 
Screening Trial that showed lung 
cancer screenings reduced mor-
tality and proved cost-effective. 
Despite the finding, lung can-
cer screenings were voted down 
when originally presented to the 
CMS in 2014.

As the principal organizer 

of the coalition to advocate for 
CMS coverage, Kazerooni said a 
diverse group of medical profes-
sionals and advocacy groups was 
necessary to achieve their goal of 
screening coverage.

“When you bring in the voice 

of the patients through patient 
advocacy, it really tells the story 
in a way that’s very impactful for 
people who are not necessarily in 
the medical field,” she said.

Kazerooni also emphasized 

another important aspect of the 
lung cancer screening — smok-
ing cessation. The requirement 
not only targets lung cancer, 
but also has secondary effects 
by reducing death from cardio-
vascular disease and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, 
Kazerooni said. By including 
smoking 
cessation 
alongside 

these screenings, she said the 
system functions in a more cost-
effective way as well.

Douglas 
Arenberg, 
associ-

ate professor of internal medi-
cine and a member of the 
American Thoracic Society — a 
group involved with the coalition 

— also stressed the importance of 
smoking cessation.

“It is absolutely imperative for 

people interested in setting up a 
lung cancer screening program to 
make the center of gravity of that 
program offering and encourag-
ing tobacco cessation amongst 
current smokers,” he said. “It is a 
far more efficient, far safer and a 
far less expensive way to achieve 
the goal of a lung cancer screen-
ing program, which is fewer peo-
ple dying from lung cancer.”

Such cessation programs are 

part of what makes the new cov-
erage not just a one-time test, but 
rather an ongoing process.

For smoking cessation to 

work, Arenberg said, several 
additional steps — including 
integrated cessation counseling, 
pharmacotherapy and follow-up 
phone calls with nurses, phy-
sicians and medical assistants 
— need to be implemented, not 
all of which are fully included 
under the coverage.

Arenberg said in a society 

consumed by instant gratifi-
cation, quitting smoking can 
be a challenge. He said while 
it would be difficult to prove 
to individual former smokers 
that quitting saved their lives, 
smoking cessation programs 
have made a big difference for 
the population at large.

Overall, Arenberg said CMS 

should provide even more funding 
toward these kinds of programs.

“We, as a society, could invest 

in prevention by providing more 
robust reimbursement for tobac-
co cessation counseling,” he said.

However, despite the benefits 

of lung cancer screening, Aren-
berg also mentioned several prob-
lematic components.

Because a lung CT scan looks 

at the whole chest, as opposed 
to other cancer screenings that 
only look at certain tissues, he 
said issues in other areas can be 
discovered that seem medically 
significant, but really are not.

“This is a very different test,” 

he said. “And it has the potential 
for harm because a lot of these 
findings are just incidental and 
don’t represent significant dis-
ease, but in investigating them 
you sometimes have to put the 
patient at risk, including invasive 
procedures that have the poten-
tial for harm.”

Because of these complexities, 

Arenberg said a major goal of his, 
as well as other advocates for the 
lung screening policy, is to inform 
people about both the benefits 
and the risks of these screenings.

Moving forward, Kazerooni 

said one of the next steps is to 
spread public awareness. While 
many physician practices are 
currently in the process of edu-
cating patients about the impor-
tance of the scans, more work 
still needs to be done with local 
advocacy groups to educate 
those who could benefit from 
the screenings.

Another condition of the 

CMS lung screening coverage 
is building a clinical practice 
quality registry into the screen-
ing. This registry compares 
the progress of the screenings 
in relation to benchmarks and 
quality metrics.

Kazerooni also said there is 

interest in helping individuals at 
risk for lung cancer for reasons 
unrelated to smoking, such as 
radon exposure, asbestos expo-
sure and a genetic history of lung 
cancer. Such efforts, she said, may 
be a future focus.

With many moving parts to 

lung cancer screenings, Kazeroo-
ni said that the biggest challenge 
in organizing the coalition was 
keeping everybody focused on 
the ultimate goal of bringing lung 
cancer screenings to those who 
needed them. Despite those dif-
ficulties, she said she was happy 
with the overall result.

“Bringing 
people 
together 

across disciplines for a common 
purpose was amazing to see as it 
started to fall into place,” she said.

dedicated to the Arab-American 
and Muslim communities on 
campus.

The establishment of a dedi-

cated space for these students 
has been an ongoing point of 
contention, but the topic was 
brought to the forefront of con-
versation during the UM Divest 
protest. A February 2014 CSG 
petition — launched the month 
prior to the protest — called 
for the establishment of such 
a lounge in North Quad and 
received almost 500 signatures.

However, Engineering junior 

Flavio Fiszman, a diversity peer 
educator at North Quad, said 
the idea of an Arab-American 
themed lounge has been under 
consideration by the multicul-
tural council for almost three 
years. Debate in the last year 
has focused on the name of the 
lounge.

“There was already a pro-

posal and the proposal had been 
accepted (in February 2014),” 
Fiszman said. “What’s hap-
pening at that time was mostly 

about the name.”

The 
lounge’s 
namesake, 

Edward Said, is best known for 
his analyses of the representa-
tions of Arab and Muslim popu-
lations in literature and media. 
He wrote extensively on Arab 
and Muslim identities in the 
United States and the Middle 
East and was known for his aca-
demic perspective on politics, 
including advocating the “one-
state solution” to the conflict 
between Israel and Palestine.

Said was a faculty member at 

Columbia University and received 
an honorary doctorate degree 
from the University of Michigan 
in 1998. He died in 2003.

Engineering sophomore Grant 

Groshek, co-chair of the North 
Quad Multicultural Council, said 
the council held a town hall meet-
ing earlier this year for North 
Quad residents to address any 
concerns regarding the lounge’s 
name. After presenting informa-
tion about Edward Said and gath-
ering input, they gave residents 
the opportunity to vote online. In 
the end, Groshek said more than a 
quarter of the dorm voted in favor 
of the name, allowing the council 
to move forward with the dedica-

tion ceremony.

Fiszman said it was important 

to respect the desires of North 
Quad residents, especially those 
living on the third floor halls sur-
rounding the lounge.

“The lounge is for the Arab-

American community, but we 
mainly 
want 
it 
representing 

North Quad residents,” Fiszman 
said.

Fiszman added that access to 

the lounge will be restricted to 
North Quad residents who com-
plete an educational program to 
learn about its history and cul-
tural message.

While Dahbour said the lounge 

is a positive step for the Universi-
ty, she elaborated that it does not 
address many of the remaining 
concerns for Arab-American and 
Muslim students.

“There’s always a lot of work 

to be done around this issue,” she 
said. “We still live in a society 
that’s very much violent toward 
Arabs and Muslims.”

“I know this means a lot to 

myself as a student here and a lot 
to the Muslim and Arab students 
here,” she added. “It’s one step for 
sure, and I just hope that the Uni-
versity continues to work on it.”

nal DACA legislation, said she 
thought the expansion was a neces-
sary step from the president.

“The Obama administration has 

been advocating for a legislative fix 
to immigration and the Congress 
has rejected that,” Schlanger said. 
“The administration would like 
to do by way of legislation, but has 
not been able to. They have instead 
been using available executive 
authority.”

However, not all were in agree-

ment with these new provisions.

In a statement issued after the 

court’s decision, Michigan Attor-
ney General Bill Schuette (R) said 
his disagreement with the bill 
stemmed primarily from concerns 
of presidential overreach.

“America has always been a bea-

con of hope,” Schuette stated. “Our 
country needs an immigration 
policy that is hopeful, encouraging 
and lawful. A federal judge agrees 
that the president’s unilateral 
action is constitutionally flawed, 
and now the rule of law will get its 
day in court.”

For Rackham student Carlos 

Robles, the original DACA was a 
saving grace.

Robles came to the United States 

about 10 years after his family’s 
business in Mexico failed. They 

crossed the border legally with 
travel Visas, overextended their 
stay and became undocumented 
immigrants.

Robles and his siblings attend-

ed public school in Palatine, Illi-
nois for multiple years, staying 
undetected. However, one spring 
break, Robles and his brother 
decided to visit a friend in Bos-
ton. Near the Buffalo/Toronto 
border, border patrol agents ran-
domly inspected the train they 
were travelling on.

Robles and his brother could 

only provide their expired Visas, 
and were taken to a county jail, 
where they spent several days. 
After posting bail, Robles said U.S 
Sen. Dick Durbin (D–IL) took on 
their case and ultimately managed 
to get them approval to stay in the 
country through the original itera-
tion of DACA.

While DACA does not provide 

any path to legal residency or citi-
zenship, it opened the doors for 
Robles and his brother to continue 
schooling, and gain work authori-
zation in the United States.

Robles said it’s possible the block 

on expansion could stop him and 
others from being able to renew 
his own authorization to stay in 
the country, though the court thus 
far has indicated that the litigation 
won’t affect individuals covered by 
the original 2012 order.

He added that while he wasn’t 

surprised by the challenge to the 
court case, it added on to the dif-
ficulty of being an undocumented 
immigrant.

“It’s furthering the same sense 

of frustration that immigrants 
have been having,” Robles said. 
“This isn’t a surprise. I’m more sur-
prised this didn’t happen earlier.”

In an e-mail interview, Assistant 

Law Prof. Kate Andrias wrote she 
believes that the current litigation 
will not have a large effect on how 
the executive branch addresses 
immigration in the long term.

However, in the short term, 

she wrote, many people’s fears of 
deportation are high.

“Immigrants who would oth-

erwise be entitled some relief are 
living with a great deal of uncer-
tainty,” Andrias wrote.

The next step for the contest-

ed expansion will be a federal 
court hearing, during which the 
court will be tasked with decid-
ing whether or not it was within 
Obama’s power to expand DACA.

Robles and Schlanger said they 

were both hopeful that future 
work to integrate undocumented 
immigrants wouldn’t be halted by 
the injunction.

“I think that the goal of immi-

gration reform is to take people 
who are here and are functionally 
Americans, and allow them access 
to the opportunities they need to 
flourish,” Schlanger said.

“The ski trip incident was 

an embarrassing and shameful 
event that was not representative 
of Michigan Greek life, weren’t 
representative of the individual 
fraternities and sororities that we 
were apart and weren’t represen-
tative of who I am,” he said.

Fidel also said he and his fra-

ternity are doing their best to 
move forward from the incident 
through charity and other phil-
anthropic work.

“We’re doing our best to right 

our wrongs and rectify the situa-
tion,” he said. “After the incident, 
I led my fraternity in commu-
nity service projects, coordinated 
with Habitat for Humanity to 
send 50 volunteers to volunteer.”

Fidel also told the Daily that 

SAM has cooperated with the 
Detroit Partnership and will send 
30 to 40 members of the frater-
nity to volunteer at a soup kitchen 
after Spring Break.

Though he did not refer spe-

cifically to the incident, Roys-
ter said he is confident in Fidel 
both as a partner and a leader on 
campus.

“Matt is just an incredible 

leader and an incredible guy,” 
Royster said. “The fact that he is 
really using CSG as a catalyst to 
drive social change on campus 
really shows that he does care.”

Overall, Fidel said, he didn’t 

think the ski resort incident 
would impact the campaign.

“Will and I have some great 

ideas for this campus,” he said. “As 
I said before, those actions don’t 
reflect on me and don’t reflect on 
our campaign. I think that as long 
as we strive to maintain our goals, 
that’s all we can do.”

LOS 
ANGELES 
(AP) 
— 

Dressed in red and raising signs 
into the air, thousands of teachers 
filled a downtown Los Angeles 
park on Thursday in demand of 
higher wages and smaller class 
sizes amid stalled contract nego-
tiations.

“Everybody in this country 

is watching this struggle,” said 
Joshua Pechthalt, president of the 
California Federation of Teach-
ers. “It’s a fight about the nature 
of public education. What is pub-
lic education going to look like?”

The rally was the largest action 

yet amid an escalating standoff 
between union and Los Angeles 
Unified district leaders: United 
Teachers Los Angeles is demand-
ing an 8.5 percent salary increase, 
a demand interim Superintendent 
Ramon Cortines contends the 
district cannot meet without sig-
nificant layoffs.

The union declared an impasse 

in February and is set to meet 
with the district and mediators in 
March. If a resolution is still not 
reached, a fact finding panel will 

convene.

Though 
still 
several 
steps 

away, union officials say they are 
prepared to strike if needed.

UTLA President Alex Caputo-

Pearl and other union leaders 
have visited hundreds of schools 
in recent months, talking to 
teachers and handing out com-
mitment cards. The cards ask 
teachers to pledge support for a 
variety of actions, from leafleting 
to a strike. About half have been 
returned so far.

“The vast majority of our mem-

bers have checked off, ‘Are you 
willing to strike?’ with a, ‘Yes I 
am willing to strike,’” Caputo-
Pearl said to applause and cheers 
at the rally.

The last major urban district to 

strike was Chicago Public Schools 
in 2012. That contract dispute 
centered largely on the role of 
student test scores in teacher 
evaluations.

In contrast, the Los Angeles 

contract standoff has focused 
mostly on teacher salaries, class 
sizes and increasing the num-

ber of support staff members 
like nurses and counselors. The 
union notes that teachers have 
gone eight years without a salary 
increase or cost of living adjust-
ment.

Union leaders contend the 

negotiations highlight an ongoing 
post-Great Recession concern: 
That while economic conditions 
have improved, cuts made dur-
ing the height of the crisis have 
been disparately restored. They 
point to new pockets of money 
that could be used to finance their 
demands, including the gover-
nor’s proposed budget, which 
would increase spending on K-12 
education by at least 8 percent.

Contines, meanwhile, is pro-

jecting a $160 million deficit for 
the next school year. He is ask-
ing every department to reduce 
expenses by 8 to 15 percent. In a 
letter to Caputo-Pearl Thursday, 
he also warned that $171 million is 
at risk if union leaders don’t agree 
to evaluation requirements nec-
essary for the district to receive 
its No Child Left Behind waiver.

Congress is currently attempt-

ing to revamp the George W. 
Bush-era law.

“We’re entering a tough phase 

because of the significant decline 
in enrollment, primarily,” said 
Tom Waldman, a spokesman for 
the district.

There were 677,538 student 

enrolled in Los Angeles Unified 
in the 2009-10 school year. In the 
2013-14 school year, that number 
had declined to 653,826.

A recent survey by the Schools 

Superintendents 
Association 

found that about half of superin-
tendents described their districts 
as stable, while nearly four in 10 
believe their district’s economic 
situation has gotten worse; but 
the study concluded that over the 
last three years, conditions have 
mostly improved.

Lily Eskelsen Garcia, presi-

dent of the National Education 
Association, said what happens 
in Los Angeles will have national 
implications, as districts weigh 
what to prioritize as the economy 
improves.

T

his week, the Athletic Department announced a 
need-based ticketing system for students of lower 
socioeconomic status. In order to receive need-based 

pricing, students must qualify for Federal Pell Grants. Given 
how ingrained athletics are into the University’s identity, this 
is an effort worth commending, as it allows more students to 
expand their extracurricular experiences.

Last fall, the Athletic Department revealed 

a roughly 38 percent decrease in student 
football season ticket prices from $280 last 
season to $175. Basketball season tickets will 
be $200 and hockey will be $150. For those 
who qualify for the need-based ticket prices, 
tickets will be reduced to $100, $120 and $90, 
respectively. According to Central Student 
Government President Bobby Dishell, a 
Public Policy senior who pitched the idea, 
this is the first need-based ticketing program 
in collegiate athletics.

There is no denying the role of athletics in 

the University’s culture. As Dishell remarked, 
“Michigan athletics, it’s something you see 
so many people rally around.” Therefore, 
it should be the priority of the University 
administration and Athletic Department 
to reach as many students as possible. 
Implementing need-based ticketing is a 
praiseworthy first step.

That said, the Athletic Department should 

turn its focus to improving more areas of the 
athletic experience for non-athletes. With the 

lowering of overall ticket prices, combined 
with the new need-based ticketing system, 
football, basketball and hockey will likely 
see an influx of students into an already-
filled student section. It must be ensured 
that students will be able to fit reasonably 
without instituting controversial seating 
policies. Solutions include expanding the 
size of the student sections in both Michigan 
Stadium and the Crisler Center. Additionally, 
along with the included T-shirt in the ticket 
package, the Athletic Department should 
consider a student discount at M-Den 
locations to bolster school spirit.

Taking the initiative and making more 

reasonably priced tickets available to students 
receiving Pell Grants is an innovative and 
much-needed program. It is another step to 
improving the relationship between students 
and athletics, one that became strained 
during the era of former Athletic Director 
Dave Brandon. The Athletic Department 
should keep working on programs to reinforce 
student support for the present and the future.

O

ver 
the 
past 
semester 

break, I decided to read my 
grandmother’s memoirs — 

an 
unpublished 

spiral 
notebook 

consisting of 150 
pages, document-
ing her upbring-
ing in Romania, 
France and Mex-
ico. I’m embar-
rassed to say that 
this was the first 
time I really read 
her stories, aside 
from occasionally 
scanning 
them 

during moments when she was a 
hot topic of conversation among 
my family. Inscribed on the first 
page is a note to her granddaugh-
ters: “Although you have known 
me as your old grandma, I too was 
once young, full of life, and living 
through some incredible times, 
including World War II.”

In her pages, she seamlessly 

details her life as a young Roma-
nian girl, brought up under the 
wing of her nursemaid. Her father 
was a prominent Romanian physi-
cian who sought to find the cure 
to cancer, working long hours in a 
research lab and paying little atten-
tion to her in her young age. She 
then moved to France, where she 
lived in a Catholic girls’ boarding 
school in order to hide her Jewish 
identity. Eventually she and her 
family escaped and fled to Mexico, 
where she lived for a number of 
years until her studies brought her 
to the United States.

I read her memoirs with fascina-

tion. Every moment of her young 
life was filled with fear — in reflec-
tion, something that sounds more 
like adventure. Her adolescence 
was filled with hunger. During the 
war, the only things her family 
could afford were broiled tomatoes. 
I remember she hated tomatoes 
because of that. However, the many 
things she saw and experienced 
were not unique to her — they 
were unique to that generation. 
My grandfather too, having come 

to the United States from Austria 
in the late 1930s, was then imme-
diately drafted and sent to combat 
in the South Pacific. Of course, he 
survived, but he returned to the 
States as much an immigrant as he 
had been when he first arrived, and 
his life was spent living coin to coin, 
paycheck to paycheck, until many 
years later when he was finally 
grounded in American society.

I fear that my grandparents’ gen-

eration is falling away slowly, becom-
ing a memory, and that I am left only 
with this book of stories to remind 
me that life during World War II was 
not what it is now. I was only in my 
early teens when I saw the movie 
“Beginners.” It’s about a man, played 
by Ewan McGregor, whose father 
has just come out of the closet. It’s 
not funny, really; it’s more a movie 
about accepting your parents and 
the differences that separate you. 
But there’s a line in it that has always 
stuck with me: “Our good fortune 
allowed us to feel a sadness our par-
ents never had time for.”

Now, let’s substitute another 

word for “sadness,” perhaps, “aim-
lessness.” And let’s substitute the 
word “parents” for “grandparents.” 
Now it reads like this: Our good 
fortune allowed us to feel aimless-
ness our grandparents never had 
time for. That sounds about correct. 
The fact that I am writing this right 
now, contemplating my feelings 
about my family and its dynamics, 
shows that I am not a part of that 
generation. I am a product of Gen-
eration Y, the Millennials — kids 
who were born anywhere from 
1980 to 2000. We get a lot of shit. 
We’re self-indulgent, lazy, tech-
savvy, tech-crazy, dependent and 
selfish. Americans of Generation Y 
can barely speak two languages — 
my grandmother spoke seven, and 
she wasn’t considered extraordi-
nary for it. My sister was recently 
on vacation and saw a famous life-
style blogger at her same hotel. She 
recognized a blogger as famous. 
Surely, there is something wrong 
with this picture.

But here is the problem. To say 

that our generation is made up of 
self-indulgent people because we 
aren’t escaping a war or because we 
aren’t living in more modest times 
assumes that anyone living in a peri-
od of modernization is incapable of 
feeling empathy and contributing 
anything more than a blog to civili-
zation. As I was reading my grand-
mother’s memoirs, I was struck by 
one thing in particular — the fact 
that some of her social views were in 
my mind completely backwards.

What we should give our genera-

tion — the self-indulgent, internet-
loving buffoons that we are — is 
credit for our level of acceptance. 
I’ve been proud to hear three of 
my male friends over dinner open-
ly admitting to their bisexuality 
without shame. I’ve witnessed my 
peers lying on the ground at die-ins 
promoting racial equality. I’ve sat 
in rooms heavy with debate over 
the current state of the drug war. I 
watched a celebrity at the Oscars 
meditate on the fact that today more 
black males are incarcerated in the 
U.S. than were enslaved in 1850.

These are small actions that have 

made me hopeful for our genera-
tion. The fight for racial and social 
equality wasn’t overtly present in 
my grandmother’s memoir. Perhaps 
that’s because she was busy surviv-
ing, but it’s also because they weren’t 
there yet, but here we are now.

There are threads that tie all gen-

erations together, manifestations of 
the human condition that will never 
fade. My grandmother constantly 
referred to her self-image problems, 
issues that resonate with people in 
any age. Although we are the genera-
tion that wallows in self-pity, adorn-
ing the Internet with our problems, 
we’re also the ones that have begun 
to stand up for what we believe in. 
We have begun to accept people as 
they are and so maybe, maybe, I feel 
less envious of my grandmother’s 
robust yet difficult life. Her chal-
lenges made it hard to care. And my 
privileges make it easier to.

I

’m sitting on the second floor 
of the UGLi at 10:30 p.m. on a 
Friday night. As predicted, it’s 

sparsely populat-
ed. My laptop has 
drained to some-
where around half 
battery 
because 

the 
outlet 
it’s 

plugged into is, 
unbeknownst 
to 

me, 
non-func-

tional. I’m writ-
ing 
equations 

and 
algorithms 

in my notebook, 
methodically within the lines and 
with a dark enough stroke to be 
noticeable by the scanner when I 
eventually submit it online. This is, 
rather unsurprisingly, not exactly the 
way I envisioned my Friday night.

On the list of “Places Where 

Things Happen at 10:30 p.m. on a 
Friday Night,” the second floor of the 
UGLi is somewhere at the bottom. 
For once, the scene is quiet. I speak in 
whispers to the friends I came with, 
who are sitting across the table for 
me, lest I disturb the next-closest per-
son, sitting 45 feet away. Whether or 
not the desolation helped my produc-
tivity or not, I couldn’t tell. Because, 
amongst the uncomfortable silence 
and the numbers and equations I 
sketch are the words and sentences 
that float in my head, describing the 
distracting details around me and 
dancing around until they form some 
semblance of, well, something.

Someone walks by, Starbucks cof-

fee in hand, presumably something 
with a few shots of caffeine. He takes 

a seat a few tables down, unpacks his 
backpack, sets his 15-inch MacBook 
Pro down, plugs it into the outlet and 
begins to type. Perhaps he’s typing a 
paper contrasting the Age of Enlight-
enment and the era of Romanticism. 
Perhaps an e-mail to a professor, or a 
job recruiter. Maybe a love letter to a 
far-off friend … who knows.

It’s inconsequential, just the story 

of some lone wanderer sitting alone at 
a table with 20 other chairs, all neatly 
pushed in and evenly spaced out at 
this time of the night. Nothing more 
than that momentary interruption 
from the papers on my table and the 
keyboard in front of me during that 
occasional glance over the top of my 
screen. Just another student, who, 
like me, stumbled into some fate that 
led to the disappointing conclusion of 
being on the second floor of the UGLi 
at 10:30 p.m. on a Friday night.

Maybe the story isn’t in this floor 

or this building, but behind the 
people in it. Perhaps this subject is 
a dual major in biochemistry and 
cellular and molecular biology with 
dreams of medical school. Or a stu-
dent in the endless struggle to make 
ends meet, working 30-plus hours 
a week and balancing 17 credits. A 
computer science major in the midst 
of launching his startup. An athlete 
after a busy week of practice. Maybe 
a CIA secret agent masquerading as 
a student, taking up his residence in 
the library each night to maintain 
his undercover identity.

Somewhere in the infinitely count-

able set of stories that could lead to 
the second floor of the UGLi at 10:30 
p.m. on a Friday night is this new 

friend, if you could call him that. So 
is the story of the friends I arrived 
with, cross-eyed Snapchatting as 
they sit across from me. The story 
of the janitor who clears the trash, 
and of the student who waits at the 
jammed printer hoping for the divine 
intervention of a visit from ITS.

This is the crux of it all, that 

somewhere stories connect, person-
ally or interpersonally, physically 
or metaphorically. Stories as silly 
as ones of cafeteria trays and squir-
rels, as serious as ones of childhood 
dreams and of loss. That somewhere 
in the inconsequential are words to 
piece together and form things of 
consequence even in the least rel-
evant of places.

So sometimes these words and 

stories in my head get written down. 
Sometimes they are printed. Wheth-
er materially captured or just emo-
tionally experienced, these stories let 
us search for and find meaning with-
in the plot they encapsulate. These 
stories form not only the escape from 
the world we live in, but they describe 
the way we experience it.

I finish the problem set I was 

working on. Tear out the page from 
my notebook, write my name in the 
top left corner. Our new friend has 
succumbed to the temptation of 
sleep, head in his arms on the table 
taking a nap. I’m tempted to join him. 
The experience of the existential 
reality that is the second floor of the 
UGLi at 10:30 p.m. on a Friday night 
can be tiring.

A 

subset of bills recently introduced into the Michigan 
Legislature has prompted concern that attempts to protect 
religious liberty in the business and healthcare sectors 

will propagate discriminatory practices. Earlier this week, three 
bills permitting faith-based adoption agencies to cite religious 
beliefs as a reason to refuse service to either unmarried or same-
sex couples were proposed by a Michigan House committee. 
Under the legislation, their refusal to serve these populations of 
individuals would in no way decrease the state funding received by 
these institutions. The emergence of this legislation demonstrates 
a desperate need to modify the state’s anti-discrimination 
policies and to re-examine the role of religion in businesses and 
 

state-funded organizations.

These bills, offering religious exemptions 

for adoption agencies, are merely an addition 
to an already large amount of legislation 
permitting discriminatory policies. A similar 
initiative was proposed in 2013, with the 
introduction of two bills that would enable 
adoption agencies to deny the placement of a 
child in a household based upon the couples’ 
sexual orientation or religious beliefs.

Denying individuals services based solely 

upon a religious viewpoint is both an ethical 
violation and a contradiction of the standard 
of separation of church and state. Although 
some jurisprudence, such as Burwell v. Hobby 
Lobby, may merely blur the lines between 
professional and personal beliefs by dictating 
the extent of coverage for medical expenses, 
other legislation advocating religious liberty 
could lead to life-threatening scenarios. 
For example, advocating the right of an 
individual to refuse to provide services, 
ranging from wedding planning to emergency 
medical treatment, sets a dangerous and 
terrifying precedent. Both situations would 
be permitted under the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act, which was reintroduced for 
consideration in Michigan in last November. 

Nationwide, roughly 19 states have adopted 
some version of RFRA.

While protecting religious liberty is indeed 

necessary in government dealings, a division 
must be maintained between religion and 
federally funded matters. Furthermore, while 
the potential enactment of these bills seeks to 
protect one group, another is left susceptible 
to various forms of discrimination. For 
example, the infant of a lesbian couple in 
Michigan was denied treatment due to the 
fact the parents’ relationship conflicted with 
the pediatrician’s religious views. Scenarios 
such as this one could reoccur if stronger 
anti-discrimination laws are not enacted 
within the state. The state’s current anti-
discrimination law, the Elliott-Larsen Civil 
Rights Act, does not include protections for 
members of the LGBTQ community, making 
discriminatory 
practices 
against 
these 

individuals perfectly legal within the state 
of Michigan. Passing these bills can only 
result in negative consequences. Therefore, 
allowing the enactment of these laws and 
failing to revise current discrimination 
protections would be a neglectful and 
disturbing move by the Michigan legislature.

A dangerous precedent

Bills protecting religious freedom are safeguards for discrimination

‘Parks and Rec’ has 
a fitting series finale

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

By CLAIRE WOOD

For The Daily

I never thought howling 

could be so sexy.

Three 
minutes 
and 
six 

seconds into Maroon 5’s latest 
release 
“Animals,” 
however, 

teen heartthrob Adam Levine 
successfully proves me wrong, 
letting out a wolf-cry that 
makes girls squeal from Cali to 
Colorado. It’s hot, animalistic, 
carnal and — fortunately for 
the band — rakes in over 157 
million hits on YouTube.

But let’s backtrack. 
“Sunday morning / Rain is 

falling / Steal some covers / 
Share some skin.”

It’s classic Maroon 5: Adam 

Levine’s velvet vocals over 
mellow 
piano. 
Their 
first 

album, 2002’s Songs About 
Jane, defines their character. 
“Harder to Breathe” and “This 
Love” overlap plugged guitar 
with strong vocals. Or consider 
my 
heart-melting 
favorite 

“She Will Be Loved.” Gentle 
percussion 
backing 
smooth 

voice, Levine has us all at the 
first line. “Beauty queen of only 
18” — and, let’s be honest, we’re 
all wishing it was us. 

It’s this style — catchy, 

yet sophisticated — that we 
dig. It’s real music with real 
instruments, from the snazzy 
percussion of “The Sun” to 
the tame piano of “Sunday 
Morning.” This self-confident, 
genuine quality keeps the fans 

hooked. 
This 
authenticity 

defines the band. 

Then 2011 rolled around, and 

BOOM: “Moves Like Jagger” 
happens. 

Believe me when I say I didn’t 

see it coming either — Levine 
took us all by surprise with that 
one. It’s catchy, enticing, and 
… not Maroon 5. We’re taken 
aback. In “Moves Like Jagger,” 
the old jams of Songs About Jane 
erupt into pulsing percussion, 
pop verses and high-energy 
whistling. 

This, however, is just the 

start. As single after single 
is released, Levine sheds his 
old identity. “Daylight” boasts 
electronic 
instrumentals. 

“Payphone” 
features 
high 

vocals, incessant beats and 
Wiz Khalifa. With their most 
recent 
release, 
“Animals,” 

Adam 
Levine 
makes 
the 

transformation complete with 
a bestial howl at the work’s 
climax.

Confession? I miss the old 

Adam. The real guitar, gentle 

piano, jazzy beats — I found 
it all rather classy, which just 
made everything sexier in my 
eyes. But that’s just me talking, 
and — based on the popularity 
of their recent releases — it 
seems that new-and-improved 
Maroon 5 isn’t doing so bad. 

Can we blame them for the 

transformation? 
Not 
really. 

While the old-time hit “Sunday 
Morning” scored 54 million 
Youtube 
views, 
Maroon 

5’s latest, pop-ified release 
“Animals” has raked in over 
double that. 

The brutal truth is that times 

change. People don’t want the 
same thing forever. Artists 
morph 
alongside 
shifting 

consumer tastes. Where would 
we be without a little change in 
music, anyway? Just think — if 
preferences didn’t change, we 
might still be stuck in the ‘70s 
(shudders in terror). Top 40 
hits tailor to please the popular 
majority, 
i.e. 
the 
teenage 

population; thus, pop songs 
have to pop. They’re played 
at frat parties and bars. John 
Lennon’s “Imagine” is a real 
work of art, but it’s certainly 
not your first choice to get 
people pumped at the Saturday-
morning tailgate. “She Will 
Be Loved” is the same way: 
gorgeous, relaxing and just not 
what people are looking for. 
Teens want something that’s 
vibrant, hot, electrifying. And 
with the band’s transformation, 
Maroon 5 give them just that.

After seven seasons, 

beloved comedy 
comes to an end

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

Tuesday night marked the end 

of an era at NBC. That evening, 
we said goodbye to the last of the 
network’s niche, 
quality 
com-

edies that have 
defined its pro-
gramming 
for 

the past several 
years. “30 Rock,” 
“Community” 
and 
“Parent-

hood” survived for much longer 
than they normally would have 
due to NBC’s perpetually low rat-
ings. Ending its run this week, the 
brilliant “Parks and Recreation” 
left us with a beautiful finale that 
gave us insight into the charac-
ters’s futures and allowed us to 
say goodbye to one of the all-time 
greatest comedies on television. 

The “Parks” finale followed 

the former members of the Paw-
nee Parks Department as they 
worked to complete “one last job” 
by fixing a broken swing. As they 
went through the process, Leslie 
Knope (Amy Poehler, “Saturday 
Night Live”) had a final moment 
with each core ensemble charac-
ter, then flashed forward to detail 
each character’s definitive end. 

Donna (Retta, “Drunk His-

tory”) moved to Seattle with Joe 
(Keegan-Michael Key, “Key & 
Peele”) and started a nonprofit 
to help finance education. Craig 
(Billy Eichner, “Billy on the 
Street”) married Typhoon and 
grew old with him. Jerry (Jim 
O’Heir, “Strip Mall”) lives hap-
pily as mayor until age 100. April 
(Aubrey Plaza, “Safety Not Guar-
anteed”) has a child with Andy 
(Chris Pratt, “Guardians of the 
Galaxy”). Tom’s (Aziz Ansari, 
“Human Giant”) restaurant goes 
under and he writes a best-selling 
book about his failures. Ron (Nick 
Offerman, “Children’s Hospital”) 
becomes the superintendent of 
the Pawnee National Park — and 
our endearing Leslie becomes the 
governor of Indiana with Ben’s 
(Adam Scott, “Party Down”) sup-
port. She is finally one step closer 
to her presidential dream.

This 
episode 
did 
exactly 

what all series finales should: 
It reminded viewers about why 
they followed — dedicated them-
selves — to the show for so long. 
The hour never lost track of the 
warm sentimentality that made 
the show great. The entire idea 
of the finale was built upon how 
much these characters truly love 
one another, and especially how 
much Leslie cares about each of 
them. It was simply another epi-
sode, without any gimmicks that 
made the show feel like it was 
something it wasn’t — just a piece 
fit for the final run.

What really made this episode 

special were the little moments 
within the flash-forwards. One 

of the best was the return of Ann 
(Rashida Jones, “The Office”) 
and Chris (Rob Lowe, “The West 
Wing”), allowing us to check 
in with characters we still care 
about, even after they left Paw-
nee (even if it did lead to Ron 
bashing the University of Michi-
gan). What made the scene was 
Poehler’s delighted delivery of 
“Ann’s here!” before running up 
to hug her. Another favorite was 
Ron out on the lake in a beauti-
fully composed sequence and 
location. There was also Jerry’s 
100th birthday party, giving the 
often-bashed character one last 
chance to celebrate. “Parks” had 
several landmark moments over 
the course of its long run (like 
the Harvest Festival in the third 
season), but what really built the 
show were the commonplace 
interactions between these char-
acters. The finale was able to 
honor that with small character 
notes of its own.

It’s fitting that “Parks and Rec-

reation” closes this particular 
chapter of NBC programming. 
The show survived for seven sea-
sons mostly because NBC had 
other problems to fix. This little 
show ran its course naturally, 
creating episodes that were man-
aged to be both hilarious and 
heartwarming. The finale served 
as a reminder of what made this 
show great and how much it will 
be missed. TV is a sadder place 
without new stories from Paw-
nee, but “Parks” undoubtedly 
leaves a legacy as one of the best 
TV comedies of all time.

FOOD COLUMN

Appreciating 
eating alone

“

White rice steaming, 
almost done. Sweet green 
peas fried in onions. 

Shrimp braised in sesame oil 
and gar-
lic. And 
my own 
loneliness. 
What more 
could I, a 
young man, 
want.” — 
“Eating 
Alone,” 
Li-Young 
Lee. 

I’ve 

read and re-read this haunting 
last stanza of Li-Young Lee’s 
account of coping with the death 
of his father, and it always feels 
self-parodying. The abundance 
of food, its sensory pleasure, 
is 
meaningless 
without 

someone, other than his own 
consciousness, to share it with. 
Granted, the circumstances of 
this lonely meal are severe. But 
in America, we still assume that 
dining alone is due to alienation 
or heartbreak or, at the very 
least, convenience. Think of 
that scene from “Forgetting 
Sarah Marshall,” where Jason 
Segel arrives at the restaurant 
and asks for a one-person table, 
only to have Jonah Hill press 
him on whether he has a wife 
or girlfriend or a magazine, 
before finally explaining, “I 
just would be so depressed.” 

Back in Ann Arbor, I eat 

alone quite often, but usually 
because I’m pressed for time 
or need to read something 
for class. I rarely go out to a 
restaurant by myself, and why 
would I? Dining solo would 
seem to be a dreary and boring 
experience, with only your 
reflection in the water glass to 
keep you company. But since 
I’ve come to Rome, I’ve learned 
to appreciate the joys of dining 
solo.

Per usual, there is a proverb 

in Italian for this — meglio 
solo che male accompagnato, 
or “better alone than in bad 
company.” 
I 
learned 
this 

slightly 
crotchety 
aphorism 

growing up, and I use it 
frequently when dining alone 
now, ostensibly to justify my 
aloneness, but really to gain a 
little credibility. To not only 
dine alone, but to proffer a 
proverb in defense of it, makes 
one look and sound, even feel, 
like a true Italian. 

However, there are pleasures 

beyond performativity in eating 
alone, which are especially 
present in Rome, but applicable 
elsewhere. I’ll get the dickish 
one out of the way first. There 
are times when dining alone 
really is preferable to dining 
in bad company. Now, “bad” 
can mean annoying, rude and 
boorish, like someone who 
will drink the wine straight 
from the bottle or drone on 
about 
their 
glory 
days 
in 

Little League (really, I’ve seen 
all of this). But, it can also 
just signify a difference in 
tastes. I’m not likely to bring 
a vegetarian to Pommidoro in 
the San Lorenzo neighborhood, 
where the house specialty is 
pajata — veal intestines, still 
stuffed with partially digested 
milk, braided and grilled. 

But 
there 
are 
tangible 

reasons to dine alone, even 
when the most adventurous 
and fun of friends are available. 
Dining 
alone 
in 
Rome 
is 

educational. When I’m with 
friends, I’m usually engrossed 
in conversation. When I’m by 
myself, I observe other patrons. 
What do they wear to dinner? 
What do they talk about? What 
do they order, and how do they 
order it? How do they eat? 
These small, almost ritualistic 
details of dining are a gateway 
to understanding any culture, 
and you’re sure to pick up on 
them better by yourself. 

Speaking of details, dining 

alone forces you to focus on 
your food. The mechanical 
monotony of eating — the 
unending waltz of cut with 
knife, spear with fork, raise to 
mouth — already desensitizes 
you. 
When 
your 
only 

companion is the plate in front 
of you, you really do pay more 
attention. The look, the taste, 
the mouthfeel … these are 
things you can slowly, carefully 
muse over. I once spent a good 
10 minutes taking small bites 
of my spaghetti cacio e pepe, 
chewing slowly, just trying to 
figure out why this version felt 
superior (cracked, rather than 
ground, peppercorns).

But what I enjoy most about 

dining alone in Rome is that 
I never really am alone. In 
most Italian restaurants, both 
staff and patrons are friendly 
and talkative to a degree that 
many Americans might find 
overbearing. When I eat lunch 
alone at Lo Sgobone in the 
Flaminio neighborhood, the 

owner shuffles over to my 
table after every course and 
asks me if I want something 
else. After he brings the new 
dish, 
he’ll 
occasionally 
sit 

down and allow me to practice 
my kindergarten Italian. And 
that’s comparatively formal — 
one time, he went to sit with 
another 
white-haired 
man, 

and they got into some sort of 
argument over the pasta, so he 
grabbed a spare fork and tasted 
it. 

Now, things can go wrong. 

A bad meal, with no one to 
talk or even gripe to, can be 
interminable. I’ve only had one 
bad solo meal in Rome thus 
far, and by the end of it, I was 
staring at the man next to me 
so intently that he asked me if 
I needed something. Even if 
I spoke Italian better, I don’t 
know if I could have explained 
that I was just desperate for 
interaction of any type to 
distract me from the bland, 
styrofoam-like artichokes on 
my plate.

But, 
like 
all 
adventures, 

eating alone has its mishaps. It’s 
an adventure I wouldn’t want to 
go on every night. I really do 
enjoy the act of sharing a meal, 
of tasting each other’s food 
and chatting and laughing in 
between and during courses. 
But sometimes, I like a meal 
like I had the other night at 
La Tavernaccia, in Trastevere. 
On one side of me sat a man 
and a woman whose first date 
had clearly ended with an 
awkward hug and an exchange 
of numbers. On the other side, 
a graying couple fed each other 
slices of prosciutto. A steaming 
plate of pasta was set before 
me, which I mixed and turned 
with my fork a few times before 
taking the first bite. 

What more could I, a young 

man, want?

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
iTunes and Spotify

By CARLY SNIDER

Daily Arts Writer

Dear Spotify,
I have to admit, I am jealous. 

It’s not easy realizing my peak 
may have passed. For years 
I basked in my dominance 
of the music world, acting 
as the go-to application for 
music downloads, storage and 
organization. I was riding high 
on Apple’s continuous success, 
benefitting from the variety 
of products – iPods, iPhones, 
Macs – that chose me to handle 
their musical needs. Then I was 
innovative, adaptive. CD and 
MP3 players were kicked to the 
curb. I could organize an entire 
library of content any way 
the user may want – by artist, 
genre, date added, playlists, etc. 
What more could anyone need? 
I was a free service (well, other 
than the hundreds to thousands 
of dollars one would spend on 
the device) that offered the 
top tier of electronic musical 
ingenuity. 
I 
even 
allowed 

illegally-downloaded 
content 

on my system – very chill of me, 
right? 

But then you came along. You 

changed 
everything, 
taking 

what I made commonplace and 
expanding upon it – showing 
me up. Now, when users go to 
open their music application of 
choice, their thumb travels to 
your round, green icon rather 

than my classic music note. 
My crisp white background is 
replaced by your, admittedly, 
sleeker black backdrop and 
more 
streamlined 
design. 

You were somehow able to 
transcend 
the 
Apple-sphere 

and become available to all 
smart phones and computers – 
something I will never be able 
to accomplish.

Your depth is undeniable; 

your appeal spans from Top 
40 pop fans to self-proclaimed 
music elitists. There are a few 
artists who deny you their 
work, so I do have to brag about 
my access to Taylor Swift. But 
users can add almost any song 
imaginable to their personal 
library with the click of one 
small plus sign or the drag 
of a mouse, eliminating my 
purchasing and downloading 
“hassles.” 

While my programming is 

all-inclusive, yours is dynamic. 
It pains me to admit this, but 
you can provide them with 
genre 
groupings 
and 
mood 

music in a way that I cannot. 
Not only do you make saving 
music easy, but you also make 
finding new artists or tracks so 
simple. How did you get so good 
at suggesting new artists? Or 
making track listings for pretty 
much any occasion? I used to 
run listening marathons of 
classic music for my user’s study 
sessions, now I am brushed 
aside in favor of your multiple 
“focus” playlists. 

When I found out that users 

need Wi-Fi to listen to your 
playlists on the go, I was sure 
that I had you. Who would 
choose to use up all their data 
on some app when they could 
use me without the extra 
charge? Music is meant to be 
mobile. But then I realized 
that 
you 
offered 
Premium 

privileges, including off-line 
mobile listening for a very 
reasonable monthly rate. You 
really seem to have everything 
figured out.

But don’t let this praise go 

to your head. I am still the 
original; I still have loyal fans 
and a strong place in the music 
industry. When an artist has 
success with an album, they 
don’t say they reached the top 
of the Spotify charts. No, they 
say they reached #1 on my 
charts. You may be the new, hip 
kid on the block, but you have a 
long way to go.

Cordially, iTunes

Bad jokes sink new 
comedy ‘Odd Couple’

Multi-camera sitcom 

wastes Matthew 

Perry’s talent

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

At this point, you can tell if 

you’re watching a CBS sitcom. 
While 
other 
networks 
have 

tried playing with multi-camera 
comedies, 
CBS 

is the only one 
to 
have 
recent 

success 
in 
the 

genre. Shows like 
“The 
Big 
Bang 

Theory” and “2 
Broke Girls” can 
be defined as a 
“CBS 
comedy” 

based merely on 
their 
appearance 

and structure. “The 
Odd Couple,” the latest sitcom 
from the network, fits right into 
this mold. The series will be able to 
find fans, but the generic jokes and 
unenthused actors aren’t really 
worth anyone’s time.

“The Odd Couple,” based on 

the Neil Simon play from the ’60s 
and the television series from the 
’70s, tells the story of recently 
divorced neat freak Felix Unger 
(Thomas Lennon, “Reno 911”) 
moving in with the messy, sports-
radio broadcaster Oscar Madison 
(Matthew Perry, “Go On”). The 
pilot features them on a double 
date with Perry’s neighbor Casey 
(Leslie Bibb, “GCB”) and her sister 
Emily (Lindsay Sloane, “Horrible 
Bosses”).

In a multi-camera sitcom, the 

jokes must be funny or else the 
studio audience laughter will 
be awkward, and the attempts 
for laughs on the “Odd Couple” 
lack any keen sense of humor. 
They follow the traditional “line-
punchline” structure that has 
defined multi-cam for years, but 
they lack any sense of invention or 
originality. When Felix comments 
on improving Oscar’s beauty, 
Oscar exclaims “I’m trying to 
be inside a beautiful person.” 
Perpetual jokes like that feel lazy, 
causing the comedy to be more 
boring than entertaining. 

It doesn’t help that most of 

the “Odd Couple” ’s cast appears 
to 
be 
sleep-walking 
through 

the episode. Perry is a gifted 
performer, but it doesn’t appear 
he gives much effort. He reads the 
punchlines with about as much 
energy as a college student right 
after exams. Lennon tries to create 
a realistic character, but he doesn’t 
have much room to work with such 
one-note material. The supporting 
cast is also a collection of talented 
actors, and the show wastes their 
potential as well. Wendell Pierce 
(“The Wire”) proves he can carry 
both 
comedic 
and 
dramatic 

material on “Treme,” and Yvette 
Nicole Brown has demonstrated 
that she can be hysterically funny 
on 
“Community.” 
However, 

they’re barely in the first episode 
and are saddled with some of the 
dullest material on the show — 
making it seem like their presence 
is purely to cash the paychecks.

CBS has shown with “Mom” and 

“The Big Bang Theory” that they’re 
capable of making imaginative 
sitcom jokes. However, “The Odd 
Couple” doesn’t try to do anything 
different with the classic stock 
story. It’s fine enough to find an 
audience between episodes of “Big 
Bang,” but not good enough to be 
worth watching.

GENDER AND MEDIA COLUMN

‘Knope we can’: 

Leslie’s impact on me

T

his column contains spoil-
ers for the series finale of 
“Parks and Recreation.”

For my column this week, I 

was going to 
write 
about 

the 
Oscars. 

I was plan-
ning 
an 

impassioned 
but 
rational 

delibera-
tion on why 
“Boyhood” 
deserved the 
Best Picture 
award 
more 

than “Birdman.” I had estab-
lished 
an 
elaborate 
schema 

charting the casual misogyny 
and studied misrepresentation 
found in “Birdman.” I spent 
more time than what is healthy 
Googling 
Patricia 
Arquette, 

and I took copious notes on her 
much-publicized Best Actress 
acceptance speech.

Then I watched the “Parks 

and Recreation” series finale 
three times in a row, and my pri-
orities changed. 

This is not a review of the 

“Parks” finale or the final sea-
son. I can’t even begin to col-
lect my feelings about what has 
quietly become the best show 
on television — funny in the 
familiar, giddy way of being 
drunk with your best friends 
and sharply political, but with a 
warmth running thick and sin-
ewy through every scene and 
storyline. 
Reviewing 
“Parks” 

would be like sitting down and 
giving my mom a letter grade on 
her job as a parent. (Though if I 
had to do it, Mom, you would get 
an A- because of that time you 
told me I might be better off dat-
ing gay guys.) But Leslie Knope 
was one of the most empow-
ering, endearing and timeless 
characters on television, and 
while saying goodbye is hard, 
her sendoff was pretty goddamn 
magical.

Sometimes it’s easy to forget 

how revolutionary Leslie had 

become over her seven seasons, 
because of the goofy awkward-
ness Poehler infused into the 
character, her dorky dancing 
and almost-sexual attraction to 
mac and cheese pizza, distract-
ing from Leslie’s impressive real 
mission. She went from being a 
lowly, slightly sad government 
employee to a beacon of liberal-
ism, a powerful public figure, 
a caring friend and balanced 
mother. 

We watched Leslie run for 

office; we watched her lose. We 
watched her face sexist cowork-
ers (from Jamm to Councilman 
Milton to the sex-negative Lang-
mans.) We watched her fight 
the uphill battle for approval 
in Pawnee, a place slyly repre-
sentative of all of conservative 
America. We watched her find 
love in her equal Ben Wyatt, 
kindly (but firmly) reject some 
weirdos (including Louis C.K. in 
one of his most cringe-inducing 
roles yet), have children and 
make a giant career leap at the 
same time. Every shade of Les-
lie blared feminist, a label she 
didn’t deny (I have a magnet 
with her quote, “Hoes before 
bros, uteruses before duderuses, 
ovaries before brovaries” on my 
fridge), but that never was her 
most salient characteristic — her 
feminism was tightly connected 
with her pluck, tenacity and 
kindness.

Leslie and her co-conspir-

ators were some of the most 
fleshed-out characters on televi-
sion, especially in comedy, but 
Poehler skillfully masked Les-
lie’s complexity in her outright 
hilarity. It was only after the 
joke that the depth behind Les-
lie’s ideology, and her character, 
coalesced. But don’t get con-
fused: Leslie Knope is one of the 
strongest and most important 
characters on TV ever, because 
of these very shades. 

In the last few minutes of the 

“Parks and Recreation” finale, 
we get a glimpse into Leslie’s 
future: She is doing something 

big, something important, some-
thing very public. Is she the next 
Hillary? Quite possible, given her 
hairstyle and Poehler’s uncanny 
past impressions of Clinton. But 
despite her power, Leslie is still 
Leslie – warm and supportive 
and overzealous. “Parks” did 
the incredible by making us fall 
in love with a character before 
her success or political awaken-
ing, when she was still a humble 
government official just trying 
to build a park. It makes Leslie’s 
path all the more rewarding, 
and the ending of the show that 
much more bittersweet.

Last month, I had a really 

scary job interview in New 
York. My flight was leaving 
at 9 a.m. and the night before, 
the clock turned 1, and then 2, 
and still I was awake, mentally 
going over my resume yet again 
as I took excessive trips to the 
bathroom. Finally, I reached 
under my bed and pulled out 
my copy of “Yes Please,” Amy 
Poehler’s autobiography. While 
there are a lot of encouraging 
chapters I could have turned 
to — her triumphant time on 
Saturday Night Live, her words 
of advice to young girls or her 
experiences 
volunteering 
in 

Haiti — I went straight to the 
chapter on “Parks.” 

I needed comfort, and I 

needed strength, and I needed 
the knowledge that I could 
succeed. Amy, through Leslie, 
has given that to me for seven 
years, reminding me that other 
bumbling, waffle-loving Mid-
western girls can find success 
and passion, and that it is OK 
for me to have high expecta-
tions for myself. Just like Les-
lie so brightly exclaimed in the 
final words of the episode, she’s 
ready for whatever happens 
next. And because of “Parks,” 
I’m ready too.

Gadbois is nailing that job 

interview. To offer her words 

of encouragement, email

On breakup albums

By MICHAEL FLYNN

Daily Arts Writer

One of the jobs of a musician 

is to convey human emotion, and 
on a breakup album, the emotion 
comes in droves. Singers and 
songwriters have been pouring 
their hearts out over this sad 
subject for years, taking many 
different approaches to their 
grief. Some breakup albums were 
sad, some incredibly angry, some 
brimming with excitement for a 
new chapter of life. The best were 
all of these at once, which is most 
representative of how a breakup 
feels as time goes on. Like those 
that stem from a relationship, the 
emotions of a breakup are varied, 
contradictory and always intense.

Many times, breakup albums 

have 
captivated 
audiences 

with their emotional honesty, 
sometimes even taking the artists 
to a new level of success.

Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours is 

one of the most famous examples, 
recorded when everyone in the 
band was breaking up ... with 
each other. The album became 
the group’s best-selling release, 
with over 20 million copies sold.

Bob Dylan has vehemently 

denied that his spare mid-’70s 
masterpiece Blood on the Tracks 
was influenced by his divorce, but 
the songs, filled with crushing 
sadness and righteous fury, seem 
too deeply felt to be pure fiction. 
The album is now viewed as 
one of his best releases, and to 
this day, reviews of Dylan’s new 
material include the quote: “It’s 
his best album since Blood on the 
Tracks!”

Occasionally, a breakup is 

enough to make an artist change 
his or her style considerably. On 
Beck’s 2002 album Sea Change, 
he eschewed his traditional hip-
hop influences in favor of a simple 
acoustic sound, and traded his 
clever wordplay for more sincere 
lyrics. Kanye West embraced 
Auto-Tune on 2008’s electronica-
influenced 808s and Heartbreak, 
using it as a melodic instrument 
and an emotional tool — the 
effect gives his voice a quavering 

sound reminiscent of a person 
on the verge of tears. And Taylor 
Swift’s smash hit Red completed 
her transformation from country 
artist to pop sensation, featuring 
modern 
instrumentation 
and 

snappy, 
sometimes 
humorous 

lyrics — the opposite of Beck’s 
approach.

The genre doesn’t seem to be 

going away, and in fact continues 
to become more popular as 
years go on. In the year 2014, 
Coldplay released Ghost Stories, 
The Black Keys released Turn 
Blue and Robin Thicke released 
Paula. They all had one thing 
in common: the theme was of a 
relationship breakup.

Why are these albums so 

popular? In some ways, the 
breakup album can be seen 
as a window into the things 
we feel but can’t necessarily 
communicate. With the huge 
variety of emotions that come 
from such a troubling event, 
it can be hard to know how to 
handle oneself, or even what to 
feel. Listening to albums like this 
can help a heartbroken person 
realize that he or she isn’t alone, 
that there is someone out there 
who feels like he or she does.

Picture a young man sitting 

in his room. He opens up 
his CD player, pops in Bruce 
Springsteen’s 
divorce 
opus 

Tunnel of Love and presses the 
play button. There is one track 
in particular that speaks to him: 
“Valentine’s Day,” the album’s 
final track. It’s a slow country 
dirge that features a man driving 
home as fast as he can, aching to 
be back with his lover.

The young Springsteen fan 

is in the midst of a long, painful 
breakup. He knows the breakup 
is what he needs, but that doesn’t 
make it feel any better. So why is 
he drawn to “Valentine’s Day,” 
a song about missing a person, 
about wanting to be back with a 
person?

Perhaps 
it’s 
because 
he 

remembers the way he used to feel, 
and the song is a reminder that 
someday, after the pain subsides, 
he will feel that way again.

Durkin, Drevno not afraid 
to shake things up in spring

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

In his first season, Michigan 

defensive 
coordinator 
D.J. 

Durkin inherits eight starters 
from a unit that finished seventh 
in the nation in total defense last 
season.

Yet none of them are assured 

their spots again in 2015.

“What I want to do is make 

sure all these guys (know) — and 
I told them as soon as I met with 
them — that they have a clean 
slate to start from,” Durkin said. 
“I want these guys to know that 
maybe you’re a guy who hasn’t 
played much, you have a new 
opportunity to do that. Maybe 
you’re a guy that’s played a lot, 
but it’s not just going to be given 
to you.

“You 
gotta 
go 
earn 
it. 

That way, the whole room 
understands they all have equal 
opportunity to go earn some 
snaps on the field.”

With 
fifth-year 
senior 

linebacker Desmond Morgan 
and redshirt freshman defensive 
back Jabrill Peppers returning 
from injury in addition to the 
starters, there’s plenty of talent 
on 
the 
roster. 
Linebackers 

coach Greg Mattison, the only 
returning coach on staff, is also 
back after coaching many of 
the same players as defensive 
coordinator last season.

Durkin said Thursday he 

would rotate Peppers between 
cornerback and safety as well as 
try different players at defensive 
line or linebacker, since the team 
will experiment with both the 
4-3 and 3-4 schemes.

“Scheme-wise and all that, 

we’re a little different from game 
to game, and that’s different 
based on our personnel from 

year to year, too,” Durkin said. 
“We’re multiple in what we do 
schematically, but I just want 
a group of guys that are going 
to play hard, be blue-collar and 
always compete for everything 
they do.”

After two days of spring 

practice, Durkin naturally had 
more questions than answers. 
Over the next five weeks, he’ll 
start 
sorting 
out 
personnel 

issues on the 
field, not based 
on past success 
or film.

“It’s 
new. 

It’s 
a 
clean 

slate 
for 

everyone,” 
Durkin said. “If there’s a guy that 
was a starter and played a lot, 
he’s not guaranteed that spot. A 
guy that didn’t play, he has every 
right to go get that spot.”

Offensive coordinator Tim 

Drevno, who came over from 
Southern 
California 
in 
the 

offseason, will also take a fresh 
look at things, even for an 
offensive line which returns all 
of its starters.

“Really, it’s just a clean slate,” 

Drevno said, nearly echoing 
Durkin. “I just turn on the film 
and see who’s doing it at a high 
level and doing it at the top of 
their craft. At USC last year, I 
started three true freshmen. 
I’m really just trying to find the 

best 
players 

out there, and 
that’s the best 
thing 
about 

it, 
guys 
go 

out there and 
compete to the 
best.”

Drevno could perhaps tinker 

even more than Durkin, given 
that he has less experience 
returning 
on 
the 
offense. 

His quarterback competition 
should be wide open between 
junior Shane Morris, redshirt 
freshman Wilton Speight and 

freshman Alex Malzone, and he 
returns four running backs with 
college 
experience: 
redshirt 

junior Drake Johnson, juniors 
Derrick Green and De’Veon 
Smith and redshirt sophomore 
Ty Isaac.

On the offensive line, he 

has some reserves waiting in 
the wings, though he did say 
he could tell in practice which 
players had experience.

“Yeah, at times I can,” Drevno 

said. “Just because they’re a 
little bit more grooved into their 
technique.”

On paper, it appears Drevno 

has more work cut out for him, 
but he looked forward to the task 
of getting his new team settled 
and toughened up on the field.

“You demand it,” Drevno said. 

“You love ‘em up, you get ‘em to 
trust you, you invite them over 
to your house for a barbecue, 
you tell ‘em that you love ‘em and 
you get them to play for you. It’s 
pretty cool when it happens.”

One final tune-up for ‘M’

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Writer

After an emphatic 81-50 win 

Tuesday over Purdue on Senior 
Night, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team celebrated the 
accomplishments 
of 
senior 

forwards Nicole Elmblad and 
Cyesha 
Goree 
and 

senior 
guard 

Shannon 
Smith.

But then it 

was 
straight 

back to work.

As students 

travel to their 
Spring 
Break 

destinations, 
the Wolverines 
(8-9 Big Ten, 
16-12 overall) 
will hit the road Saturday to travel 
to Champaign to take on Illinois 
in their final game of the regular 
season. The Fighting Illini (5-12, 
14-15) aren’t just a team below 
them in the Big Ten standings, but 
also a team Michigan has already 
beaten this season.

The Wolverines can’t get too 

complacent, 
though, 
because 

a loss to a team ranked No. 95 
in the RPI standings will be 
deemed a “bad” loss to the NCAA 
Tournament 
committee 
and 

would most likely knock them out 
of at-large consideration for good.

But if Michigan can replicate 

the dominance it showed a 
month ago in Ann Arbor, when it 
defeated the Fighting Illini, 70-57, 
the Wolverines won’t have to fret.

Michigan dominated Illinois 

both in the paint and behind the 
arc as freshman guard Katelynn 
Flaherty went 5-for-9 from 3-point 
range, leading the team with 21 
points, while Goree and Elmblad 
combined for 26 rebounds inside.

Starting off the game on a 10-4 

run, the Wolverines never looked 
back and extended their home 
winning streak to five.

While the Fighting Illini shot 

just 21.1 percent from behind 
the arc and 38.5 percent overall, 
Michigan turned the ball over 25 
times, keeping the game much 
closer than it seemed.

Since 
the 
victory, 
the 

Wolverines have struggled to 
string together victories and have 
gone 3-7, including three straight 
games in which the Wolverines 
lost late leads.

Illinois has not fared much 

better since the Jan. 26 game 
either, going 4-6. The Fighting 
Illini picked up two wins, though, 
against Minnesota and Ohio State, 
two teams Michigan has lost to 
this season.

Illinois, which starts three 

underclassmen and a first-year 
transfer, is led in scoring by guard 
Ivory Crawford, who leads the 
team averaging 15.3 points. Center 
Chatrice White leads Illinois on 
the boards with 7.1 rebounds per 
game.

The Wolverines will also have 

to watch out for forward Jacqui 
Grant, who led the Fighting Illini 
with 17 points and 10 rebounds the 
last time the two teams met.

After the game in Champaign, 

Michigan will travel to the 
Chicago area to play in the Big Ten 
Tournament at the Sears Centre 
Arena in Hoffman Estates, Illinois 
starting March 5.

Since Michigan has already 

locked up the No. 8 seed in the 
tournament, it wouldn’t appear 
the Wolverines have much to play 
for.

But with an NCAA Tournament 

at-large bid still on the line, this 
last game can’t be treated as a 
consolation game.

NOTE: It was announced 

Thursday 
that 
Elmblad 
was 

named 
to 
the 
Capital 
One 

Academic All-America third team. 
After receiving recognition on the 
second team last year, Elmblad 
becomes just the second player 
in Michigan history to earn two 
national academic honors. She 
has also garnered two Academic 
All-Big Ten awards as well as two 
Big Ten Distinguished Scholar 
awards in her career.

Q&A with Terps’ 
Evan Smotrycz

By DANIEL FELDMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team will be in 
unchartered water when it 
travels to No. 14 Maryland on 
Saturday. Sure, the Wolverines 
last played the Terrapins in 
2008, but you would have to go 
all the way back to 1937 to find 
the last time the two played in 
College Park.

Something 
Michigan 
will 

find 
familiar 
Saturday, 
though, is 
fifth-year 
senior 
forward 
Evan Smotrycz. The former 
Wolverine 
transferred 
to 

Maryland after his sophomore 
year at Michigan in 2011, when 
he helped the Wolverines win 
a share of the Big Ten regular-
season title.

After sitting out a year, 

Smotrycz was back in action 
last season, averaging 11 points 
and six rebounds per game.

While Smotrycz’s minutes 

have gone down this season, the 
Terrapins (11-4 Big Ten, 23-5 
overall) have found success in 
their first season in the Big Ten. 
After defeating No. 5 Wisconsin 
on Tuesday, Maryland stands 
alone in second place in the 
conference.

The Daily sat down with 

Smotrycz at Big Ten Media 
Day in October to discuss 
playing Michigan, air travel 
and sage advice he can give out 
regarding the tough Big Ten 
conference.

The Michigan Daily: When 

did the idea of playing Michigan 
again come into your mind after 

transferring?

Evan Smotrycz: I mean, 

right now, we’re just trying 
to get better. But when the 
schedule came out, I was 
interested in seeing how many 
times we play them and where. 
(Michigan’s) only coming to us.

TMD: Is it upsetting you’re 

not playing at Michigan? Maybe 
the lobsters would have showed 
up again.

ES: You know what, it would 

have been nice if we could have 
gone there and get a win. But 
you know it’s a tough place to 
play, so can’t say I’m mad about 
it.

TMD: Do you think you’ll 

be able to give analysis on 
other Big Ten teams, or will 
your knowledge be limited to 
Michigan?

ES: I’m pretty familiar with 

some of the stuff that other 
teams 
run. 
Unless 
they’ve 

switched it up, because a lot of 
the personnel has changed a lot. 
But I have familiarity with the 
venues and what it takes to win 
on the road in the Big Ten. So I 
think I’ll be of help.

TMD: The Big Ten basketball 

Twitter

tweeted 
a 

photo out before of you talking 
to Beilein. What do you two talk 
about?

ES: Oh, you know. Just 

exchanging 
pleasantries. 
I 

haven’t seen him since I left. 
I was talking to him and Tom 
Wywrot, the communications

TMD: 
Have 
you

Yeah, here and there I talk to

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Wolverines searching for 
sweep against Wisconsin

By ERIN LENNON

Daily Sports Editor

Good things happen at Yost Ice 

Arena.

Sunday, after 43 days away 

from home ice, 
the 
Michigan 

hockey 
team 

snapped 
a 

three-game 
slide. With a 
5-2 victory over 
Ohio State, the 
17th-ranked 
Wolverines 
(9-5 Big Ten, 
17-11 
overall) 

reclaimed the 
Big Ten lead 
and a spot in 
the 
USCHO.

com poll after 
falling out of 
the top 20 one 
week ago.

They will return to Yost this 

weekend against Wisconsin in 
near-desperate need of a sweep 
if they want to secure an at-large 
bid to the NCAA Tournament. If 
Michigan loses any more than 
one of its six remaining games, it 
will likely have to win the Big Ten 
Tournament to earn a spot.

But for the third straight week, 

the Wolverines will have to prove 
themselves, this time against a 
Badger squad that’s peaking at 
the right time.

“They’re a dangerous team,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson. 
“They’re 
probably 

playing pretty loose, and they’re 
hoping get off to a good start 
here.”

Ranked among the worst 

in college hockey all season, 
Wisconsin has had nowhere to 
go but up since beginning the 
season 0-8. But with a roster full 
of freshmen, the Badgers have 
improved steadily in the second 
half. Wisconsin tied Minnesota 
on Jan. 31 before stealing road 
wins at Ohio State and Michigan 
State in February.

Despite their recent success, 

though, a loss to the Badgers 

would doom the Wolverines in 
the PairWise Rankings, as they 
saw after dropping seven spots 
following their Friday night loss 
to Ohio State last weekend.

“Obviously we’ve had some 

games where we’ve slipped up 
and let some teams off the hook, 
to say the least,” said sophomore 
forward Tyler Motte.

That’s not to say Michigan 

should lose either matchup to the 
Badgers.

The Wolverines put up an 

impressive 
13 
goals 
against 

Wisconsin (2-10-2, 4-20-4) the 
first time they met, pairing a 
come-from-behind win with a 
shutout by sophomore goaltender 
Zach Nagelvoort to secure a 
sweep in January.

“It’s amazing,” Berenson said. 

“When we’re really focusing on 
defense, the offense kicks in. 
That’s always the way it’s been 
here. … Whenever we’re paying 
attention to defense, we get the 
puck more — otherwise you’re 
chasing.”

But 
with 
the 
offense 

significantly cooler these days 
— Michigan has scored just 
10 times in its last four games 
— the Wolverines will need 
their goaltender to be as good 
as Wisconsin netminder Joel 
Rumpel has been this season.

Though junior Steve Racine 

got both starts against the 
Buckeyes, expect Nagelvoort in 
net Friday. Racine played well 
through two periods Sunday, but 
allowed two sloppy goals with a 

late lead.

“We can definitely play well 

every night, but it’s just something 
we need to stay focused on,” said 
junior forward Boo Nieves. “It’s 
the little things, like winning 
faceoffs and possession.

“We saw in Minnesota that 

when we didn’t have possession, 
the puck was going in our net.”

Whichever goaltender starts 

will benefit from a reignited 
duo in freshman Dylan Larkin 
and senior Zach Hyman. The 
second-line forwards’ drought 
coincided with Michigan’s three-
game losing streak, but the duo 
combined for eight points Sunday.

Hyman — who became the first 

Michigan player to surpass 40 
points in a season since current 
New York Rangers forward Carl 
Hagelin — notched six points 
against Wisconsin in Madison.

The offense may also get a 

boost with the return of senior 
center Travis Lynch to the fourth 
line. Lynch has missed nearly 
two months after having wrist 
surgery in January. Since then, 
the Wolverines have skated three 
full lines, rotating the three 
centermen in with the fourth 
line.

Michigan has just three home 

games remaining this season. 
Good things happen at Yost, but 
the Wolverines will need to be 
great if they want to make the 
NCAA Tournament for the first 
time since 2012.

“We have to win,” Motte said. 

“That’s our mindset right now.”

8-Sports

played point guard — the appropriate 
position for her size — and learned how 
to deal with enormous pressure when 
leading the ball up the court and creating 
space.

She kept waiting. High school started 

and with it, Goree hit her growth spurt. 
By then, Goree had learned to love 
being physical and tough, easing the 
transition to play in the post and helping 
her eventually make the transition to the 
collegiate level.

Goree had finally become “Big Byrd.”

***

Today, many Michigan fans wouldn’t 

recognize the Crisler Center before its 
2012 renovations. For Goree, though, the 
two are indistinguishable.

The outside walls were colorless, 

windows didn’t line the concourse, and 
the building seemed as if it had been out 

of commission for years. Inside, players’ 
benches were on the opposite side of the 

court, the jumbotron lacked today’s 

enormity, 
and 
the 
lower-level 

bleachers were colored maize.

Despite its imperfections, it 
still served as home for Goree 

when she was a high-school 

freshman.

“I kind of feel like 

I’ve 
been 
at 

Michigan for 

10 years,” 

Goree 

said. “I was here at those games when 
Crisler was the original.”

Mesmerized, 
Goree 
watched 
the 

Wolverines closely, envisioning herself 
replicating every move and every basket 
in her own mind on the very same court.

Nearing the start of high school, the 

Grand Rapids native started attending 
as many home games as she could. 
She idolized players like center Krista 
Phillips, forward Carly Benson and guard 
Veronica Hicks, and she witnessed the 
evolution of the team as it went from 
coach Cheryl Burnett to Kevin Borseth, 
who later recruited her.

Goree remembered being shy around 

the players, who would always say hello, 
sign autographs or take a picture with her 
after each game.

“I felt like I was a part of the team, even 

though I wasn’t,” Goree said. “It’s just 
something that I loved and wanted to be 
in their shoes one day and give back that 
same feeling I got with them.”

She knew she belonged on the Crisler 

hardwood. She was just waiting for the 
opportunity.

***

The love never subsided, and at the 

start of her freshman year, Goree started 
signing up for any Michigan basketball 
camp she could make. She even spent a 
birthday playing inside Crisler. She always 
knew that there was only one uniform she 
wanted to wear.

At the end of her sophomore year, 

though, that dream nearly vanished.

In the first game of the National 

Youth Basketball Tournament at 

Kalamazoo Courthouse, Goree 

went for a block and tore 

her right anterior cruciate 
ligament.

Fortunately, 
the 

injury came at the end 
of 
the 
season 
with 

several months to rehab 
her knee before the 
start of junior year — 
recruitment season. If 
there was any chance of 
making it to Ann Arbor, 
Goree needed to be in top 
form.

She 
got 
a 
cadaver 

replacement in her right 

knee, endured a five-month 

recovery period and waited for 
the day she could return to full 
strength. When she did, there 
were two full years ahead of her 
to finish high school on a high 
note.

Borseth 
showed 
great 

interest 
in 
Goree, 
who 

exhibited unequivocal talent 
on the court. In just a two-
year span at Wyoming Park 
High School — after spending 
her first two at Rogers High 
School — Goree set the 
school’s single-season block 
record at 73 while averaging 
16.9 points (560 total) and 13.7 
rebounds (455).

Goree had also become 

even more acquainted with 
the Michigan team, and 
started attending tailgates 
with 
players 
and 
their 

families 
during 
football 

season. That was when 
she met Sam Arnold, a 
freshman forward at the 
time and one of Goree’s 
best friends to this day.

“I think Byrd has such a 

magnetic personality,” Arnold 

said. “I think people love 

to be around her, and 
I think she lights up 
a room. … She was all 
about Michigan. From 
when she was little, 
she was waiting for 

that offer.”

The 
waiting 

paid off when she 
received a phone 
call Borseth.

“We 
want 

you,” he said.

***

Though 
Goree 

was finally wearing 
maize and blue, she 
had to wait another 
two years to log her 
first 
meaningful 

minutes.

“For her coming in, there was getting 

in shape and being able to play at the 
college level and college speed,” Arnold 
said. “Getting stronger, getting her 
conditioning level up.”

Arnold, 
four 
other 
juniors 
and 

three seniors were ahead of Goree in 
experience, so she sat on the bench for 
almost all of her rookie season, playing 
just nine minutes in three games.

As she waited, the dream she was living 

nearly fell apart once more in March 2012, 
before Michigan traveled to Oklahoma for 
the NCAA Tournament.

During a practice, Goree cut the wrong 

way in a full-court, one-on-one offensive 
drill. It was a repeat of the events from 
three years before — the same ACL and 
right before the first game of a postseason 
tournament.

“You never really know how important 

it is until it’s gone,” Goree said. “I just 
wanted to walk stairs, and couldn’t.”

To rehab the injury, Goree had to be 

more disciplined and work even harder 
than she had years earlier. But with the 
tear occurring in the same leg, it meant 
playing time was, once again, far away.

***

In April 2012, Borseth left Michigan, 

and former St. John’s coach Kim Barnes 
Arico quickly filled his position.

When she arrived, Goree always 

told Barnes Arico how much she loved 
basketball. But it didn’t mean she would 
play.

“You’re rehabbing right now,” Barnes 

Arico told her. “You talk a lot, but I need 
you to show me how much you love 
basketball.”

Goree accepted the challenge.
Before her sophomore season, she 

stayed for spring and summer term to 
undergo a rigorous physical therapy 
schedule: class, rehab, class and back to 
rehab in the evening. For three to four 
hours a day, she and assistant coach Joy 
McCorvey worked to strengthen Goree’s 
mobility and basic motions.

When the season approached, Goree 

didn’t participate much in practice, and 
instead spent her time on the sidelines 
doing rehab exercises. Goree wanted 
nothing more than to play, and tried 
convincing McCorvey she could.

“It was hard for her to sit out and not 

be part of stuff on the court,” Arnold said. 
“Having people tell her ‘no, no’ was hard 
for her to hear, but something that had to 
be done.”

Added Goree: “It was all mental for me. 

You can easily work hard to get back in 
shape, but if your mental game is not set 
and where it needs to be at that time, it 
can really hurt you.”

Once again, Goree was spending her 

time at Crisler like she had in high school: 
waiting on the outside while looking in.

***

As Goree continued to adjust to the 

college intensity, Barnes Arico still 
wasn’t convinced she loved basketball.

Barnes Arico never gave Goree breaks 

or free compliments, afraid it would only 
make her slack. Barnes Arico didn’t want 
her making any excuses, either.

“There’s always roadblocks, whether 

that’s in the course of a basketball game, 
getting a second foul, missing five shots in 
a row, not getting a rebound she wants,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Or whether it’s 
struggling in a class, or having to do an 
extra workout. I always would say to her, 
‘you have to find a way to get it done.’ ”

Twenty-five games into the season, 

she started winning more and more 
battles in practice against that year’s 
veterans — Arnold and Sheffer, plus 
fellow seniors Jenny Ryan, Nya Jordan 
and Kate Thompson. Barnes Arico 
couldn’t believe it.

Goree’s progress earned her four 

minutes of playing time in the first game 
of the 2013 Big Ten Tournament against 
Indiana. In that time, she scored four 
points and collected two rebounds.

That night, after the win, Barnes 

Arico’s husband, Larry, asked why 
Goree didn’t play more, saying she was 
a valuable asset and even predicting that 
she’d make All-Big Ten the next year.

“Sure she will,” Barnes Arico replied 

lightheartedly, thinking there was no 
way he’d be right.

***

Entering the second half of her career 

at Michigan, Goree got her chance to 
shine.

This was the new Cyesha Goree — the 

one who shed 20 pounds in the offseason 
and built the strength she needed to have 
in the post. She wasn’t the Goree who had 
spent years watching from the bleachers, 
or the one lingering in the shadows while 
battling a second ACL tear.

Barnes Arico continued to test her 

while 
establishing 
a 
new, 
scrappy 

standard that Goree and the team needed 
adjust to. Michigan women’s basketball 
was evolving once again, but this time, 
Goree was at the center of it.

Goree wasn’t alone in ushering the 

change, and she had help in the form 
of then-junior guard Shannon Smith, a 
transfer from North Carolina.

Both Goree and Smith clicked right 

away, with Smith taking on the role of an 
instructor, even as a newcomer.

“I haven’t really met someone like 

Shannon before,” Goree said. “I think 
Shannon brings out the best in me. I 
want to say other people on the team are 
scared to tell me when I do something 
wrong or when I need to fix something. 
Shannon’s not.”

Added Smith: “You want what’s best 

for your friends. If you see something 
that’s not what you think (it) should be, 
you call them out on it. Even if you call 
them out, you let them know you care.”

Go harder. Run faster. Catch the ball. 

They’re the critiques Smith wasn’t afraid 
to make, even if she was a newcomer, and 
they were the ones that helped Goree 
complete her transformation. For her 
help, Goree calls Smith her “ace.”

Goree started all but one game last 

season en route to a team-best 13 double-
doubles and setting the single-season 
rebound record at 317. She also beat the 
Michigan NIT scoring record (24) by two 
and tied the rebounding record (11), both 
set four years earlier by one of her role 
models, Krista Phillips.

More importantly, Goree was named 

to the All-Big Ten Second Team, just as 
Larry Arico had predicted.

“I used to tease her all the time,” 

Barnes Arico said. “I used to challenge 
her all the time and say, ‘You’re never 
gonna get there,’ or ‘You don’t have the 
work ethic and the heart to really be 
the player that you’re saying that you’re 
going to be.’

“The greatest thing about Cyesha is 

she has proven me wrong.”

***

Now in her senior year, Goree is the 

biggest target on every team’s scouting 
report. Even the coach of No. 5 Maryland, 
Brenda Frese, said Goree was a “major 
concern” before the Jan. 29 matchup.

“Junior year, nobody knew about me, 

as a lot of people say, so I wasn’t first 
on their (scouting report),” Goree said. 
“Now, what am I gonna do when I’m the 
first thing on their (scouting report)?

“That can’t stop me.”
It hasn’t. Goree has averaged 14.5 

points and 10.6 rebounds while recording 
15 double-doubles this season. And 
her team can’t afford to have her stop 
anytime soon, with Michigan four days 
from the Big Ten Tournament and still 
looking to make the NCAA Tournament 
— a dream still alive thanks to Goree.

“I never knew she would have that 

drive, that incredible motor and love for 
the game,” Barnes Arico said. “She had 
told me about it, but I’ve had millions of 
kids through the years tell me they have 
it. Not only did she tell me, she showed 
me. There have not been very many kids 
that have done that through my 20-year 
coaching career.

“She’s a story of all stories.”
Tuesday, Michigan earned a blowout 

win over Purdue with Goree collecting 
team-high 11 rebounds on her Senior 
Night. When the game was over, Goree 
stood at midcourt, waving to the crowd 
with classmates Smith and Nicole 
Elmblad by her side.

This was what she had waited for: 

to be with her teammates, to play in 
Crisler and to inspire those around her. 
According to Barnes Arico, it felt like 
Goree brought “half of Grand Rapids.”

She brought even more remnants from 

her childhood: the nickname “Big Byrd,” 
written on a sign held by one of the team’s 
male practice players.

As Goree walked back into the tunnel 

one last time, leaving Crisler cheering 
behind her, she high-fived a few kids 
leaning over the railing.

She could finally give back to a younger 

generation of women’s basketball players, 
the younger Cyesha Gorees.

Big Byrd had waited her turn.

The road to stardom has 

been difficult for 

Cyesha Goree

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

When Cyesha Goree first stepped onto 

a basketball court, it wasn’t to compete 
with the girls.

There were fewer opportunities for 

a girl to play basketball back then, and 
Goree’s best chance would be to sign 
up for the girls’ little league at her local 
YMCA. But Goree wanted more than that. 
Little league wasn’t enough.

So she played with the boys.
Still a few years away from playing 

on her middle school girls’ team, Goree 
joined the local boys’ league to satisfy 
her competitive drive, even if that meant 
playing tougher opponents.

More than a decade later, the 6-foot-3 

Goree is now the starting center for the 
Michigan women’s basketball team, but 
the journey has been far from easy —
injuries and personal and physical growth 
always tested her patience and grit.

When she started playing in elementary 

school, she didn’t have the luxury of the 
size advantages she now exploits for 
Michigan. Her head was bigger than her 
body, so her aunt nicknamed her “Byrd,” 
like Tweety Bird, to be exact, which was 
later adopted by her teammates. She was 
short and really just waiting to grow taller.

Once she was on a girls’ team, Goree
