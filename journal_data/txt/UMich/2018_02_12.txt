While 
most 
University 

of Michigan students were 
preparing to watch the 52nd 
Superbowl last Sunday, LSA 
sophomore 
Alex 
Mullen, 

Rackham student Richard Nunn 
and other members from the 
Latinx Alliance for Community 
Action, Support and Advocacy 
had a different task at hand — 
finalizing their list of demands 
to the administration.

The list of demands was 

created in response to the lack 
of Latino representation felt 
on campus. In December, La 
Casa led a boycott against the 
Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs 

Office for overlooking members 
of the Latino community in 
the search for a new associate 
director. In addition, the Latino 
community was targeted by 
various incidents of racial bias 
on campus this year, including 
anti-Latino 
statements 
like 

“F— Latinos” and “MAGA” 
spray painted on the Rock in 
September.

The list of demands was 

sent out early last Monday, 
calling for more representation 
in administrative levels and 
in 
the 
curriculum, 
more 

student services for the Latino 
community and a less hostile 
campus environment. 

With 
Valentine’s 
Day 

coming 
up, 
a 
traditional 

image may come to mind — 
chocolates, roses, and often 
a man and woman. But on 
Friday, the Consent, Outreach, 
& 
Relationship 
Education 

program — a volunteer branch 
of the University of Michigan’s 
Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 

and 
Awareness 
Center 
– 

explained not all relationships 
fit this heteronormative mold. 
The presentation, held at 
the Michigan Union, titled 
“Our Love is Beyond Your 
Imagination,” 
illustrated 

healthy 
non-cisgender 

relationships. 

Alex 
Jenny 
and 
Effee 

Nelly, 
a 
nonbinary 
couple 

who met at the University as 
undergraduates, headlined the 
event. The couple has dedicated 
their lives to spreading their 
art and voice as queer and 
transgender people of color.

Jenny and Nelly began their 

program by reading some of 
their written pieces that they 
explained have helped them 
process their lived experiences. 
Nelly’s first piece, “Truth Takes 
Time,” described the hardships 
of coming to accept her identity.

“Growing up in Ecuador, I 

cannot remember ever learning 
about trans people in a positive 
light, if at all,” Nelly said. 
“With time, nonetheless, I have 
learned to deeply admire my 

younger, flamboyant self.” 

Throughout the presentation, 

Jenny and Nelly revisited the 
theme of accepting and loving 
their younger selves, who didn’t 
quite yet know who they were. 
The couple also recited one of 
their unpublished pieces for the 
audience, explaining they often 
reflect on their younger selves.

“As trans people, we find 

ourselves thinking about the 
past a lot,” Nelly said.

Despite this, they have found 

solace in each other and shared 
that loving each other allowed 
them to “embrace the parts of 
ourselves that we thought were 
unlovable.”

The 
presentation 
then 

transitioned to a Q&A session. 
Jenny and Nelly were asked 
about the role of social media 
in 
their 
relationship, 
the 

importance 
of 
compromise, 

and growing and maturing 

together. The couple uses social 
media to display their art, and 
when asked about the platform, 
Nelly said it has become a way 
to connect with others.

“I love connecting with all 

the queer and trans people that 
we are able to connect with,” 
Nelly said.

A three-year pilot program 

designed to address the needs 
of Henry Ford College transfer 
students who wish to study 
humanities at the University of 
Michigan will begin as early as this 
summer, thanks to a $1.6 million 
grant fund from the Andrew W. 
Mellon Foundation.

The Transfer Bridges to the 

Humanities @ Michigan program 
is a collaboration between the 
University and HFC, a two-
year institution in Dearborn, 
Michigan. 
The 
University 
is 

hopeful this initial project will 
lead to similar future projects with 
Grand Rapids Community College 
and Schoolcraft College. LSA has 
already dedicated $400,000 to 
establish new transfer bridges 
with both these institutions. 

Angela Dillard, LSA associate 

dean 
for 
Undergraduate 

Education, commented on the 
University’s commitment to the 
success of community college 
transfers in a University press 
release.

Themed “Black Box: Into the Unknown,” speakers discuss to sold-out crowd

TEDxUofM held its ninth annual 

conference, Black Box: Into the 
Unknown, on Friday with a sold-
out crowd at the Power Center. 
Eight speakers from the University 
of 
Michigan 
and 
Ann 
Arbor 

community presented, focusing on 
how their experiences and choices 
have shaped their lives. The event 
was livestreamed on TEDxUofM’s

Kinesiology senior Jacqueline 

Katz served as the co-director for 
TedxUofM this year.

“We look for diversity in our 

speakers … so that our students and 
community members who come can 
be interested in multiple talks,” Katz 
said.

Engineering

appreciated 

how different the speakers were, 
emphasizing the significance of the 
content of their talks.

“I used to watch Ted talk

With the 2018 elections on 

the horizon, candidates across 
parties and levels of government 
have begun fundraising for 
their 
campaigns. 
Campaign 

finance reports released last 
Wednesday 
by 
Michigan’s 

Secretary 
of 
State’s 
office 

show large sums of money 
flowing 
into 
gubernatorial, 

congressional, 
attorney 

general and secretary of state 
races in Michigan, indicating 
competitive 
and 
expensive 

upcoming elections.

According to the reports, 

fundraising 
for 
this 
year’s 

gubernatorial race is going at 
more than double the pace of 
2010, when incumbent governor 
Rick Snyder, R, was elected. 
So far, the 12 candidates for 
governor 
have 
collectively 

raised nearly $17 million. The 
four 
Republican 
candidates 

have collectively raised about 
$5.8 million and the Democrats 
candidates 
have 
raised 
$11 

million.

how those felt.”

John Pollack –– Consultant
John 
Pollack, 
an 
author 

and Ann Arbor native, began 
the presentations by speaking 
about the role of analogies in 
government, 
innovation 
and 

daily lives. Pollack served as a 
speechwriter for former President 
Bill Clinton and now works as 
a consultant for Fortune 500 
companies, philanthropies and 
non-profit organizations.

In an interview with The Daily, 

Pollock described the importance 
of analogies in seeing problems 
from a new perspective.

“We’re in a world of hurt: we 

need new solutions and new ideas, 
and new ways of bridging divides,” 
Pollack said.

Piotr Westwalewicz –– 

Professor

Piotr 
Westwalewicz, 
Slavic 

Languages 
and 
Literature 

professor, 
spoke 
about 
his 

experiences 
growing 
up 
in 

Soviet Poland during a time of 
censorship and strict curfews, 
which reinforced his belief in the 
connections between protest and 
fun. Westwalewicz focused on 
his involvement in the Orange 
Alternative — a form of peaceful 
protest 
through 
absurd 
and 

nonsensical 
elements 
— 
and 

redefining what is traditionally 
considered rebellion.

“Competitive success doesn’t 

depend on clenched fists and grim 
faces,” Westwalewicz said.

Keiana Cave –– Student and 

Inventor

Engineering 
sophomore 

Keiana Cavé spoke about how she 
stopped setting long-term goals, 
as they curbed her spontaneity 
and could potentially prevent her 
from following her dreams. Cave’s 
journey began with her research 
on the 2010 BP oil spill, and has 
since has published two research 
papers and been honored in the 
Forbes 30 Under 30 “Energy and 
Cleantech” category.

“Maybe it’s a good thing when 

people laugh –– if your idea is so 
crazy and out of this world, maybe 
it’ll revolutionize an industry,” 
Cave said.

Joe Holberg –– Businessman
University alum Joe Holberg 

then went on to speak about the 
disparities 
among 
Americans 

regarding financial knowledge. 
Holberg owns Holberg Financial, 
a company that helps people 
improve their financial health and 
wellness.

During 
his 
presentation, 

Holberg 
explained 
many 

Americans do not have a basic 
understanding of personal finance 
and wonder if they are handling 
their finances correctly.

“It 
doesn’t 
matter 
where 

you’re at on the socioeconomic 
spectrum...everyone 
wants 
to 

know, ‘am I doing it right?’” 
Holberg said.

Marcus Collins –– Lecturer
Business 
lecturer 
Marcus 

Collins discussed his experience 
being Black in his career and in 
American society, using a black 
sheep 
metaphor 
to 
promote 

“unity of humanity.” Collins 
explained growing up in the 
Detroit public-school system, 
where he swam competitively 
and attended band camps. He 
said he felt he did not live up 
to the image society portrayed 
him to be.

“When I’m among white 

people, I was too Black, 
couldn’t be any Blacker,” 
Collins said. “Among my 
own people, I wasn’t Black 
enough.”

In an interview with The 

Daily, Collins said he hopes 
the audience learned how to 
become more accepting of 
differences in the world.

“If everyone was just 1 

percent better to each other, 
if everyone was just 1 percent 
more inclusive than they 
were exclusive, imagine what 
that would be in aggregate,” 
Collins said.

Huda Essa –– Author
Alum and author Huda 

Essa 
then 
presented 
on 

the importance of learning 
the 
history 
and 
correct 

pronunciation 
of 
names. 

Essa now works as a cultural 

competency consultant.

During her presentation, Essa 

addressed the development of bias 
and how it can limit relationships 
among different groups of people.

“Regardless of our backgrounds, 

from a very young age, we begin 
and continue to form unconscious 
biases based upon what we’ve been 
exposed to,” Essa said. “When it 
comes to various groups of people, 
we will find that what we’ve been 
exposed to is usually limited and 
often biased.”

Sava Farah –– Restaurateur
Sava 
Lelcaj, 
Ann 
Arbor 

resident and restaurant owner, 
spoke about her family’s escape 
from communist Albania, and 
how Albanian hospitality and 
hustle influenced her to open her 
restaurant Sava’s.

“These 
values 
have 

underpinned my life story that I’ve 
written for myself, with the belief 
– the insane belief – that each and 
every one of us has the power to 
write our own story,” Lelcaj said.

 Chris Gatti speaks at the Ted 

x UM event at the Power Center 
Friday. Buy this photo

Chris Gatti –– Gymnast
University alum Chris Gatti 

talked about overcoming societal 
pressures and personal struggles 
throughout his life. Gatti was 
drawn to gymnastics at a young 
age to detract attention from his 
stutter, which he said often made 
himself and those around him 
uncomfortable.

Gatti studied Industrial and 

Systems 
Engineering 
while 

serving as captain of the University 
men’s gymnastics team and signed 
a contract with Cirque du Soleil 
just weeks after defending his 
thesis. He has since found a way to 
combine his talent in engineering 
with his passion for performing, 
to find both success and happiness.

“I felt pulled down this path 

where I should be doing something 
that was good at rather than 
something I loved,” Gatti said.

Looking at the Numbers

The bar has also received attention 
for its practice of selling "Skeeps 
cards" –– $3,000 cards that give 
their owners VIP status, allowing 
them to cut the line and enter 
without providing proof of age. 
According to a 2014 Spoon 
University article, the Skeeps card 
was originally given to patrons 
who accumulated a $1,000 tab 
and tipped 20 percent, but the bar 
had to raise the price several 
times to match demand.

The presentation also included 
statistics gathered from the 
2015 U.S. Transgender Survey. 
According to the survey, 33 
percent of trans people who 
saw a health care provider 
stated they had negative 
experiences regarding their 
health, 24 percent had to 
teach their medical provider 
about their health as a trans 
individual and 23 percent did 
not consult a doctor at all for 
fear of mistreatment because 
of their identity.

After repeated calls from 
citizens and the HRC for 
council to improve oversight 
over local police, the council 
approved a $200,000 review 
of policing practices conducted 
by Chicago consulting firm 
Hillard Heintze, LLC. The firm 
released a report calling for a a 
“co-produced policing 
committee,” and many 
residents considered the 
results unsatisfying, and even 
counteractive.

With a total budget of $56.8 
billion, a 0.6 percent increase 
from the year before, K-12 
schools would see an increase 
from $120 to $240 in 
foundation allowances per 
student. This increase is twice 
as large as the budget 
approved by lawmakers last 
year.

“It ended up taking 30 to 50 
minutes, or something 
outrageous like that,” (Music, 
Theatre, and Dance freshman 
Kamryn) Thomas said. “And it 
kept updating the ETA, and I 
was like, ‘Is my phone broken 
or something?’ I didn’t want to 
cancel the ride in case they 
were coming soon or 
something. So I just sat there 
and waited.”

Despite these challenges, 
U-M’s Ann Arbor campus has 
held up well, with the number 
and percentage of international 
students growing almost 
uninterrupted for 10 years. In 
2008, the percentage of 
international students at the 
University's Ann Arbor campus 
was 11.55, growing to 15.14 
percent in 2017.

What does it mean to be Asian 

enough?

 
Black hair.
Off-white skin.
It is in my name.
The home where I was raised.
 No shoes indoors.
 Bags of rice in the cupboard
 And on the counter
 And in the cooker.
I don’t speak mother/father’s 

language

But I do speak her culture.
 Respect your elders.
 Everything in moderation.
In America, Asian culture 

has been stir fried, pickled, and 
packed into a take out box.

So it is digestible
Just a taste
To help you feel
Cultured.
 
My 
grandmother 
left 

Thailand to clean American 
hotel rooms and save money to 
bring my mother to America.

My great-grandfather pulled 

sugar cane back when it was still 
Kingdom of Hawai’i.

Saving pennies.
Cutting coupons.
Turning off the lights.
Never wasting food.
When my mother emigrated 

from Thailand, at age 12, she 
learned English from her peers.

My grandfather enlisted in 

the army to prove his loyalty to 
the country he called home.

She/He paid her/his way 

through college.

And became a doctor.
And sent my father to law 

school.

My 
mother/father 
always 

wanted to be a musician.

But it takes a few generations 

for those kinds of dreams

To become reality.
 
When I walk into the audition 

room

Am I Asian enough?
Definition lies somewhere in 

between.

Perception is theirs.
Identity is mine.

“2,000 
years 
of 
revenge, 

vendetta and murder. Welcome 
to Beirut.”

This is what the beautiful 

cultural center that is Beirut, 
Lebanon is reduced to in Jon 
Hamm’s new movie, “Beirut,” 
due for release in April. Taking 
place during the Lebanese civil 
war in 1982, the trailer follows 
a white man (who is also a U.S. 
diplomat) who fled Lebanon in 
1972 after his family is killed 
and returns ten years later to 
negotiate for a friend’s life.

There are many problems 

with this film, and I didn’t even 
have to watch the movie to be 
angered by them; the trailer, 
released January 11th, itself 
was enough. For starters, it 
portrays Beirut as a ravaged, 
war-torn, deserted wasteland. 
Even during the civil war, 
which was caused by Israeli 
invasions, 
Lebanon 
never 

looked this bad. Furthermore, 
the movie is not even shot in 
Lebanon — it is shot in Morocco 
– and features approximately 
zero actual Lebanese actors. 
Personally, I find it insulting 
that 
thousands 
of 
people 

will pay to view the depicted 
somber setting of Lebanon 
with a starkly suspenseful plot 

following a white protagonist 
and the portrayal of the United 
States and Israel as the heroic 
dynamic duo. The fake accents 
are laughable, the plot is cliché 
and the white victim/savior 
complex is beyond overplayed.

We’ve 
seen 
it 
countless 

times — a story portraying us 
as 
uncivilized, 
destructive, 

barbaric and in need of saving. 
Our countries and cultures are 
misrepresented, our customs 
are mocked and our religions 
are scoffed at. Only certain 
movies 
featuring 
Arab 
or 

Muslim people are eaten up 
by mainstream media, and it 
is very evident they are the 
ones that feature the infamous 
white 
savior. 
“American 

Sniper,” 
another 
popular 

white-savior film, tugs at the 
heartstrings 
of 
uneducated 

American sympathizers who 
view soldiers as heroes and 
foreigners as terrorists. But 
who’s to blame when minorities 
are repeatedly portrayed as 
such in mainstream media? For 
many, the only knowledge they 
have about Arabs is what they 
see on the big screen, and this 
perpetuates an ignorance about 
our cultures that breeds hatred.

As someone whose parents 

are 
Lebanese 
immigrants, 

and someone who has spent 
many summers in Beirut, I feel 

indignant at this one-sided 
portrayal. When I think of 
Beirut, I think of long stretches 
of white sand and the cool water 
of the Mediterranean Sea. I 
think of my grandmother’s 
cheetah-printed couches and 
the 
countless 
neighborhood 

cats that my cousins and I 
claimed as our own. I still 
remember vividly when our 
favorite cat, Lolita, gave birth 
in our backyard. It is where 
my mother grew up, in a small 

southern 
suburb 
of 
Beirut 

that now hosts around 30,000 
Syrian and Lebanese refugees. 
I think of downtown Beirut and 

its vibrant energy and how it’s 
nothing like the war-torn, ash-
filled trash it was made out to 
be in this trailer. Yes, war is a 
part of Lebanon’s history, but it 
is not the entirety of it.

The reason for my mention 

of these personal experiences 
with 
Beirut 
is 
to 
prove 

that, 
to 
many 
people, 
the 

wrongful 
misrepresentation 

and exploitation of a country 
produces 
strong 
personal 

responses. 
Until 
you 
have 

experienced a culture, and 
truly felt its love, its beauty, 
its pain and its suffering, 
generalizing it and reducing 

it to “2,000 years of revenge, 
vendetta and murder” is not 
only 
erroneous; 
it’s 
lazy. 

What about the hundreds of 
thousands of Lebanese people 
who died during the war? 
What about the million, about a 
quarter of the population, who 
were displaced as a result? Are 
they not more deserving of a 
storyline than a hypothetical 
white man who supposedly 
saved them all? I am not alone 
when I say white people need 
to stop portraying themselves 
as heroes all the time. White 
saviorism is rampant and has 
been since the beginning of 
time, and minorities and people 
of color keep being depicted 
as savages who need saving, 
when 
honestly, 
it’s 
usually 

white Americans from whom 
we need saving. Certain parts 
of our culture are chosen to 
be celebrated — our food, our 
music, our city life — while 
other 
parts 
are 
discarded, 

put on a screen and distorted, 
and twisted into a way that 
benefits the filmmakers and 
misrepresents us entirely.

I’m not saying you shouldn’t 

see the film (well, I sort of am). 
But, at least, keep in mind that 
what you are shown on a screen 
is often not the reality of a 
country or its people.

On my way back to the 

University of Michigan, I tried 
studying 
for 
my 
biostatistics 

exam that was waiting for me the 
upcoming week.

Likelihood. 
Significance. 

Confidence. 
All-important 

statistical concepts I should have 
been reviewing, yet my mind 
could not help but associate them 
with the adventurous weekend I 
had in the San Francisco Bay Area 
from January 25-28 with what 
are now my newfound families: 
the Empowering Pilipino Youth 
through Collaboration and the 
National Federation of Filipino 
American Associations.

What was the likelihood that 

I would meet so many amazing, 
inspiring people?

Who would have thought one 

weekend would be so significant 
to me?

How is it possible to have 

gained so much self-confidence to 
become a better leader?

I don’t really mind if I don’t 

have answers to all the questions 
left in my head. What matters to 
me is that I am extremely grateful 
to have had an opportunity to 
represent the Midwest youth 
and to learn from so many bright 
Filipinx American leaders around 
the nation.

NaFFAA is a non-partisan 

and 
non-profit 
organization 

committed to amplifying the voice 
of Filipinx Americans through the 
development of leadership, civic 
engagement and advocacy. As 
the largest national affiliation of 
Filipinx-American 
institutions, 

NaFFAA has implemented the 
EPYC ambassadors program to 
connect the younger generation 
of Filipinx Americans to the older 
generation of Filipinx Americans 
through 
the 
strengthening 

of 
personal 
and 
professional 

development.

As EPYC ambassadors, we 

were fortunate enough to explore 
Google (thanks to the Filipino 
Google Network) and ABS-CBN, 
a Philippine news and media 

enterprise, on Friday to talk with 
seasoned experts of the tech and 
media industry. Conversations 
were centered around Filipinx-
American identity and its impact 
on careers. Each person was more 
than happy to give advice to us 
younger 
Filipinx 
Americans. 

After, we attended the NaFFAA 
Leadership 
Summit 
Welcome 

Reception 
at 
the 
Philippine 

Consulate. 
Several 
NaFFAA 

and Filipinx Americans leaders 
delivered 
inspiring 
speeches: 

Calls to action to empower and 
connect our community.

Saturday came, and the day 

was 
dedicated 
to 
leadership 

development. While the Board of 
Governors convened, the EPYC 
ambassadors and I gathered to 
discuss crucial topics concerning 
leadership and advocacy, such 
as workshop building, conflict 
resolution and coalition building. 
We also had a chance to sit into the 
Board of Governors meeting, talk 
to the rest of NaFFAA leadership 
to present the concerns of younger 
generations in our prospective 

regions, and reveal each of 
our EPYC Capstone Projects. 
Overall, I felt so thankful to 
have a chance to connect to the 
Filipino-American community 
among different generations and 
regions. It’s important to me that 
we, as a community, are united.

My favorite part throughout 

this 
incredible 
experience 

was simply existing in such 
a 
welcoming 
space. 
Prior 

to the weekend, the EPYC 
ambassadors had never been in 
one room together. Most of us 
had only spoken to each other 
via our monthly webinar and the 
occasional Facebook message. 
But, when I first walked into 
the house we stayed at, I was 
immediately met with kindness 
and a sense of familiarity. 
Throughout the weekend, we 
had deep conversations about 
our lives as Filipinx-American 
student leaders, but also about 

our lives as humans in general. 
I 
felt 
so 
comfortable 
being 

open — as if I knew my fellow 
ambassadors for all my life. It was 
sad to have the weekend end, but 
I left knowing that the bond we 
made will bring us back together 
again.

To Brendan Flores, our favorite 

“kuya,” and countless others who 
are a part of NaFFAA leadership, 

thank you so much for the 
opportunity. I hope to work more 
closely with you all!

To the EPYC coaches and Jason 

and Leezel, I can’t thank you all 
enough for all the work you do for 
us ambassadors. Your guidance 
has given me new direction 
to become a better leader and 
advocate. The dedication you have 
to uplift the Filipino-American 
youth motivates me to do the 
same.

To 
my 
fellow 
EPYC 

ambassadors — my colleagues and 
new friends — I wrote this on the 
airplane back to the University, 
and I have the biggest smile on my 
face. Of course it’s sad to have our 
first encounter be cut so short, but 
I know that we’ll see each other 
soon, and I can’t wait for that 
time to come! My Midwest heart 
is so full as you all have inspired 
me. What a wonderful feeling it 
is to have gained a new family 
of bold, selfless individuals like 
yourselves.

As I have to go back to studying, 

I do not dare be a statistician. 
I couldn’t have imagined the 
likelihood to have the chance 
like this to be so empowered. But 
even more so now, what I do dare 
to be is Filipino American with 
ambition.

I have always been an avid 

watcher of television. I was 
raised on Nickelodeon, Cartoon 
Network and Disney Channel and 
learned everything I needed to 
know from those three channels. 
All of which helped me become 
the stunning individual I am 
today. To this day, I still love 
watching television but I honestly 
have to ask, WHERE HAVE ALL 
THE BLACK SHOWS GONE?

Black television used to be a 

STAPLE of American television 
in the ’90s. The number of popular 
Black television programs is more 

than I can count on one hand. 
“Family Matters,” “Sister, Sister,” 
“Living Single,” “Fresh Prince of 
Bel-Air,” “Martin,” “A Different 
World,” “Moesha,” “Kenan and 
Kel” and so many more. If you 
were Black in the ’90s you were 
never at a loss for television 
options. And more than that, they 
were GOOD! They were funny, 
the characters were endearing, 
they taught good lessons and 
they were something that I 
would definitely look forward to 
watching weekly if I were a teen 
during that time.

One of the most notable 

factors about all of these shows 
too though, is that on the shows, 
Black people were portrayed as 

people. They weren’t portrayed 
as caricatures or stereotypes; 
they weren’t token characters 
that 
were 
just 
best 
friends 

to whoever the main white 
character was. They had lives 
and stories and experiences and 
were portrayed as real people 
as they should be because Black 
people ARE real people. These 
shows were relatable to more 
than just Black audiences because 
the experiences the characters 
faced were things that an average 
person could relate to.

The ’90s must have been an 

amazing time to be an upcoming 
Black actor or actress because of 
the plethora of role models you 
had to look up to in the media. 

Nowadays, Black TV shows and 
role models are harder to find. 
Yes, ABC did come out with 
“Black-ish” in 2014, and it is a 
good show, but as a Black person 
I can say I was a bit disappointed 
when it came out. “Black-ish” 
is written for the wider ABC 
audience that isn’t necessarily 
Black, not an audience that is 
Black. That means a show about 
Black people for white people, not 
a show about Black people FOR 
Black people.

Of course, there still have been 

some masterpieces in the past 
couple years, for example, “Dear 
White People” and “Insecure.” 
I remember I watched “Dear 
White People” all in one night 

because once I started watching 
I couldn’t stop. I was shocked by 
how relatable it was; how funny, 
raw and accurate it was about 
what it’s like to be a Black person 
in this day and age, especially in 
college. “Insecure” is also great 
because other than just Issa Rae 
in general, it has an all Black cast 
and it’s funny, real, relatable and 
tells the truth about the hardships 
you have to face as a Black woman 
in today’s day and age.

We obviously have a long way 

to go before we get back to the 
reign of black TV we had in the 
’90s, so, for now, I’ll just keep 
watching reruns of “The Fresh 
Prince” until I can create my own 
hit Black sitcom.

A

merican tennis player 
Billie 
Jean 
King 

once 
said, 

“Sports teaches you 
character, it teaches 
you to play by the 
rules, 
it 
teaches 

you to know what it 
feels like to win and 
lose — it teaches you 
about life.”

When 
I 
joined 

the 
public-school 

system, one of the 
very 
first 
things 

I did was join the 
track-and-field team. I was 
not sure what I was getting 
into, but I did know one of the 
nice ladies from my church 
was the coach of the eighth 
grade team. She told me I 
should join the team, and in 
a yearning for familiarity, I 
obliged. And I never looked 
back.

I guess you could say 

I was fairly athletic, and 
my 
classmates 
started 
to 

notice. They pressured me 
to join both the football 
and basketball teams and, 
knowing 
the 
feeling 
of 

exhilaration the track team 
gave me, I consented. As 
someone who had never seen 
a basketball before (growing 
up without TV or internet, 
on a farm in the middle of 
nowhere, you don’t get to see 
everything), let alone played 
the game, I spent most of my 
first season watching and 
learning. By sophomore year, 
I was playing on the varsity 
team and by junior year, I was 
in possession of one of the 
much-coveted starting spots.

My 
first 
lesson 
from 

sports was the importance 
of teamwork. Our football 
and basketball teams were 
plagued 
by 
players 
who 

were ineligible because of 
academic requirements. We 
needed every player we could 
get, and when one failed, it 
brought us all down. I worked 
with my teammates after 
school, and I would even ride 
my bike to Saturday school 
to make sure everyone was 
passing their classes.

We 
won 
some 
of 
our 

games during our first three 

basketball seasons, but we 
lost a lot more: We only won 

exactly one game 
my 
junior 
year. 

I 
proceeded 
to 

receive my first 
lesson 
in 
the 

importance 
of 

resilience. 
We 

continued 
to 

work 
hard, 
on 

and off the court, 
no 
matter 
what 

the 
scoreboard 

read. 
I 
would 

host weightlifting 

sessions after school, and my 
teammates would help me 
refine my game fundamentals. 
Our hard work paid off, and 

by my final season, we had 
turned our 1-20 team into the 
second best in the conference, 
even earning a playoff bye 
week.

Not only did playing sports 

teach me many valuable life 
lessons, it provided me with 
an irreplaceable brotherhood: 
a group of guys that would 
do anything to help improve 
each other. Even if we didn’t 
like one another initially, we 
left it all behind when we 
stepped onto that court, turf 
or track. Some of my very best 
friendships budded within 
the team setting.

Sports did indeed teach 

me about life. I was able to 
improve what I was good at 
and learn from what I did 
wrong. Sports provided a 
structured environment and 
a controlled place to relieve any 
stress or anger I might have.

According to Engineering 

sophomore Travis Dantzer, 
center 
for 
the 
University 

of Michigan Men’s Rugby 
Football Club and former 
fullback for the University 
football team, high school 
sports “gave me a lot of 
leadership 
opportunities… 

I was captain in basketball 
junior and senior year and 
then senior year for football.” 
When asked what qualities 
he’s carried with him beyond 
high school, Dantzer noted 
“the development of work 
ethic” as well as the ability 
and drive to “work really 
hard at something to see even 
moderate success.”

In the college setting, 

Dantzer states that sports 
“gave me 40 good friends, 
like 
immediately. 
Coach 

Sparks 
has 
been 
a 
huge 

resource to me, he helped 
me a lot with starting my 
blog.” As for the networking 
side of things, Dantzer says, 
“Most of my other friends are 
from church, so by playing 
rugby, I get to interact with 
a lot of people who have a lot 
different views than me on a 
lot of stuff, that I normally 
wouldn’t be friends with.”

“Not only has it made me 

more resourceful, it’s also 
given me initiative, I’m not as 
scared as a lot of other people 
are to just try new things, 
knowing 
that 
they 
might 

not work, which has really 
been helpful in other aspects 
like clubs, doing some work 
ventures I’ve been involved 
in and starting a blog and 
podcast,” Dantzer said.

Being actively involved in 

sports has numerous benefits 
and teaches many important 
life 
skills, 
including 

confidence, 
optimism, 

dedication and much more. 
The 
perks, 
though, 
are 

not exclusive to playing a 
sport. While nothing can 
replicate the lessons learned 
in the team setting, simply 
staying active and exercising 
regularly is a great way to 
gain and improve those skills.

I

’m taking a class right 
now about the history of 
LGBTQ studies, and it’s 

having a profound impact on 
how I see myself and my own 
sexuality. We often discuss the 
social construction of gender 
and sexuality. This is what 
that means: To say sexuality is 
constructed is to point out that 
when we describe someone as 
homosexual or heterosexual, we 
are saying that person has their 
eyes on a love object whose sex 
does not change. They will spend 
their whole lives pursuing sexual 
partners of this same sex, and 
anything that falls outside of this 
pattern is deviant, unexpected 
and/or wrong. And when that 
person does break out of that 
dominant pattern, they are not 
listening to themselves and are 
deceiving themselves into some 
false reality.

The 
dominant 
narrative 

around 
sexuality 
continues; 

nothing can throw you off that 
path. Your sexuality is your 
essence, distinct from all of your 
other traits, not influenced by 
anything that you experience, 
because this thing is how you 
were born. You were born this 
way, and you will die this way.

We say this is constructed 

because none of this is a “fact.” 
Our speculation of what should 
happen and what should be 
people’s 
sexual 
desires 
and 

inclinations is all produced by our 
collective, 
culturally-produced 

expectations of sexual behavior. 
As we have read in this class from 
queer theorists, sociologists and 
historians alike, historically there 
have been multiple cultures with 
understandings of homosexual or 
heterosexual behavior entirely 
different from our own — based, 
for example, not solely upon the 
sex of the chosen love object 
but, instead, centering on what 
kind of role you take during sex: 
passive versus active, receptive 
versus 
insertive, 
etc. 
Other 

understandings are based on your 
gender presentation, or any of 
the other individual preferences 
within your own sexual desires.

I’m 
also 
taking 
this 

class 
while 
in 
the 
throes 

of 
contemplating 
my 
own 

sexuality. The truth is, I don’t 
know. I don’t know what I like, 
I don’t know who I want to be 
with. I’ve only ever been with 
women, but these experiences 
have almost never felt as natural 
or as open-and-shut as they 

seem to be for all my “straight” 
friends, 
who 
talk 
about 

heterosexual sex with a certain 
facility and comfort that I have 
always found alienating.

I also know I have sexual 

desires for men every now and 
then. I recently switched my 
Tinder settings to show me both 
men and women. And this feels 
like a step in the right direction. 
I am definitely swiping right on 
a fair number of dudes who I can 
imagine myself getting to know, 
cuddling with and all the rest.

But still, there is nothing 

conclusive. 
No 
moment 
has 

happened yet when I think, “This 
is my sexuality, this is who I am.”

And this ambiguity tears 

me up. It makes me feel totally 
alienated from myself, like I 
don’t know anything about who 
I am. If I can’t figure this out, 
who am I, at all? Not having this 
knowledge when I am about to 
graduate and enter the “real 
world” makes me existentially 
anxious, as if not knowing this 
thing means I know nothing at 
all. Mired in feeling sad about 
this 
ambiguity, 
everything 

around me gets sucked into a 
whirlpool of negative thoughts: 
a force that drains all of the 
life out of everything I am 
experiencing, transporting me 
to a faraway place where only 
I roam, a place inaccessible to 
anybody else, where all that 
once seemed promising and 
light 
now 
appears 
gloomy, 

hopeless and unknowable.

I think part of the reason why 

I feel so sad about not knowing 
has to do with the pressure 
caused by the social construction 
of sexuality, the pressure to apply 
a label to myself — in other words, 
to know what I am. This system 
of categorizing desires (modern 
conceptions of homosexuality 
and heterosexuality only first 
entered our discourse at the end 
of the 19th century) does not 
really allow for not knowing. 
Sure, there is the category 
“Questioning.” 
But 
this, 
of 

course, doesn’t serve me beyond 
a passive, limited way of stating 
these thoughts I am having. 
There isn’t any depth to this 
moniker. What is the context of 
these questions, and why are they 
happening? It fails to capture the 
context of my investigations, to 
capture anything deeper than its 
surface level description. It’s not 
specific to my experience, to the 
sets of questions I am grappling 

with every day.

I also think, though, that self-

realization can only really come 
through experience, through an 
open and honest engagement 
with the people around me. 
My dear friend and roommate 
lives his life with extraordinary 
deliberateness 
and 
attention. 

For example, he doesn’t like 
us using swear words in our 
apartment, because they taint 
his ongoing dialogue with God. 
As a secularly-raised person, I 
initially felt this concept to be 
strange and restrictive.

But now, in fact, I would 

like to live with this same level 
of openness. Not necessarily 
in touch with God, and not 
necessarily 
refraining 
from 

swearing, 
but 
instead 
more 

generally remaining relentlessly 
aware of the fact that all 
interactions might contribute or 
lead to something divine. That by 
maintaining an open heart while 
examining my own mind and 
interacting with people in order 
to collaboratively explore their 
minds, I might come to some 
greater understanding of myself 
and my own (conflicting, messy 
and erratic) set of desires.

The class I’m taking provides 

me with a really vital education 
into the experiences of people 
with 
non-normative 
sexual 

identities throughout the history 
of humanity and the construction 
of those sexualities according to 
the cultural and social moment of 
those various times.

But it is also really helping 

me 
deconstruct 
a 
pressure 

I feel strongly but do not 
remember learning, a pressure to 
categorize, name and know my 
sexuality in some irreversible, 
definite way that defines my 
essence, forever. Instead, I’m 
trying to buck this trend. By 
demanding something deeper 
than these labels, than this path 
that everyone expects me to 
take, I am opting out of sexuality 
as a system. My thoughts about 
my own sexual desires are trying 
to work against this dominant 
paradigm by cultivating a new 
voice, one that is accepting and 
wildly supportive of my — and 
everyone’s — messy process of 
coming to a place that works 
for us, distinct from any label or 
culturally produced expectation.

Opting out of sexuality 

ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS | COLUMN

W

hen 
I 
was 
in 

elementary 
school, 

I had a laminated 

placemat with the presidents listed 
on it. Presidents were 
always interesting to 
me. George Washington 
had very different hair 
from Bill Clinton. And 
wasn’t it crazy that 
John Adams was the 
father of John Quincy 
Adams? My very liberal 
mother 
often 
talked 

about 
and 
involved 

me 
in 
supporting 

Democratic presidents; 
We canvassed for John Kerry in 
the 2004 presidential election, 
and I was confused waking up 
and seeing that George Bush was 
our president. I remember hearing 
her say, “It is going to be a long 
four years.” This always struck 
me, because Abraham Lincoln 
was celebrated in school since I 
could remember — but he was 
a Republican. I never stopped 
thinking about it. 
 As I grew up, I learned about 
the 
history 
and 
foundation 

of 
political 
parties, 
and 

understood 
that 
they 
were 

very different in the past. But 
why, even as a young kid, did 
I question the character and 
beliefs of Abraham Lincoln just 
because our placemat said he 
was a Republican? Because I 
had thought for a long time that 
one side was perpetually in the 
right, and one was in the wrong. 
But in reality, I was the culprit 
of affiliating vague ideologies 
with beliefs that differ from 
person to person.
 There is power in asking 
questions, recognizing what you 
do not know and finding someone 
who does. But there is also 
power in questioning what you 
do know: your core beliefs and 
your understanding of the world 
around you. A question. Seems so 

simple, right?
 We live in an extremely 
politically-divided nation, where 
one side is always pitted against 

the 
other. 
Blame 

comes 
from 
both 

sides, with different 
perspectives 
and 

multiple reasonings. 
There 
is 
very 

little room for any 
“in-between,” 
where 
you 
are 

not 
reprimanding 

someone 
for 

misspeaking 
or 

supporting 
the 

“wrong side.” And it is easy to 
revert to outright dislike of people 
solely based on their political 
beliefs before hearing about their 
actions or their thoughts.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

It is easy, whatever side you may 
be on, to automatically classify the 
opposition as “the other.” When 
you disagree with the beliefs of an 
argument, it is common to associate 
those beliefs with the person who 
holds them, thus further promoting 
our partisan society.
 I am a culprit of acting in 
this manner, regardless of the 
political knowledge I have gained 
since the time of presidential 
placemats. I was a politically-
active student last fall, and I 
definitely 
remember 
President 

Donald Trump’s election. After he 
became president, it was very easy 
to blame the Republican Party for 

his actions. This overstatement is 
glaringly wrong, and within the 
last year, I have recognized the 
power of a question.
 Last year, I remember sitting with 
a friend during class right after the 
election. I knew this friend had 
voted for Trump and I was still 
upset by his decision. When Trump 
fired James Comey, I was confused 
and overwhelmed by the changes 
that our nation was experiencing. 
So instead of attacking my friend, 
for one of the first times in my life I 
civilly asked him what he thought of 
the Comey situation; did this change 
his views about the president? 
Did he believe this was infringing 
upon a supposedly independent 
organization? And, of course, what 
did he think about the border wall? 
Instead of attacking his views, I 
questioned them. To my surprise, I 
was able to engage in an hour-long 
discussion about the reasoning 
behind his political beliefs. This did 
not make me support his decisions 
whatsoever, but it did help me to 
understand the logical thought 
process of the “other side.” And this 
was a powerful moment.
 This is the time for critical 
reasoning. To look at a situation, 
a person, a candidate and truly 
think about what they are saying, 
proposing or doing. And, more 
importantly, why they are saying, 
proposing or doing these things. 
So, question your peers on their 
beliefs. Question your family, your 
professors, your mentors. We all 
have something to learn from the 
other side. Talking about politics 
with a Republican, Democrat, 
Libertarian — whoever it may be 
— does you absolutely no harm. 
Questioning someone else’s beliefs 
only allows you to understand 
them more, and to understand your 
position more, too.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Monday, February 12, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

There’s a moment early in 

“Fifty Shades Freed” — the final 
chapter in that most venerated 
saga of smut — where Anastasia 
Grey (Dakota Johnson, “How to 
Be Single”) takes off her bikini 
top and utters the words, “It’s 
boobs in boobland.” I did what 
amounted to an aural double-
take. Surely no one had written 
that line. Someone had to have 
said something. I looked around 
to gauge the reactions of those 
around me. They sat transfixed 
by the glow of the IMAX screen, 
like sexually starved deer in the 
quasi-pornographic headlights. 
I steeled myself and joined them. 
I was in trouble.

Until a short time ago, I 

prided myself on having never 
seen a “Fifty Shades” movie. It’s 
not that I had a problem with 
their audience, I just always 
assumed that if I walked up to 
a box office and said to another 
human being, “One for ‘Fifty 
Shades,’” the parts of my soul not 
shattered by “The Emoji Movie” 
would simply disintegrate. It 
was self-preservation more than 
anything else. I just wasn’t as 
steeped in the “Fifty Shades” 
mythos as I am, say, “Star Wars” 
or “The Room.” I knew the basic 
“boy meets girl, boy introduces 

girl 
to 
poorly 
represented 

BDSM” beats of the story, and 
that’s it.

Then, 
last 
Sunday, 
I 

mentioned to my editor that I 
had seen “Fifty Shades Freed” 
was playing in IMAX and was 
more morbidly curious than 
I’d ever been. This was taken 
as me volunteering to write 
about it, and it was unanimously 
decided by a jury of my peers 
that I would be sent to document 
“Fifty Shades Freed: The IMAX 
2D Experience.” Some small part 
of me expected it to include a 
scratch-and-sniff.

My ticket was ordered online, 

so I had only to deal with the 
judgment of the usher, who took 
it and glanced up at me, her brow 
furrowed. I tried to smile at her. 
That seemed to make it worse. 
She handed my stub back to 
me, and I had to fight the urge 
to sprint past her. I timed my 
entrance to the theater so that 
I took my seat after the lights 
went down, my hood pulled 
over my head like a Benedictine 
monk. Finally, the movie started.

To begin, I have to ask: In 

the era of #MeToo, did no one 
say, “What if we gave our main 
protagonist 
something 
even 

remotely 
resembling 
agency 

in her own story, or at least a 
higher IQ than your average 
Pauly Shore character? And hey, 
what if we make our male lead 

less sexually aggressive instead 
of constantly doubling down on 
his emotionally, mentally and 
physically abusive behavior?”

Christian 
Grey 
(Jamie 

Dornan, “The 9th Life of Louis 
Drax”) is the kind of man who 
at one point says to his wife, 
unironically, “If you love me, 
why do you defy me?” This is 
followed shortly by scenes where 
it seems “Fifty Shades Freed” is 
trying to make a statement on 
rape culture, even while Grey 
himself epitomizes the worst of 
it. It’s cinematic hypocrisy at its 
worst.

Not to worry, no sooner has 

the happy couple been married 
than they’re thrown headfirst 
into an out-of-nowhere thriller 
storyline 
that 
will 
provide 

the illusion of a plot when the 
characters aren’t busy sexing 
each other into oblivion. This 
leads to no less than two scenes 
where Ana, the woman who once 
had to ask what a butt plug is, has 
to act as a getaway driver. These 
moments, and many others, are 
accompanied by one of the most 
invasive, cloying soundtracks 
I’ve ever heard; the parts of 
the film that don’t play like the 
beginning of a mid-budget porno 
play instead like the worst parts 
of a car commercial and a music 
video.

It wasn’t an entirely joyless 

experience. On three separate 

occasions, 
I 
found 
myself 

giggling so hard I had to 
physically stifle my laughter. 
The first of these was my fault, 
as a sex scene accompanied by 
an attempt at a “sexy cover” of 
James Brown’s “I Feel Good” 
caused me to picture the same 
scene dubbed over by the original 
version. This was cancelled 
out by the woman behind me 
starting 
to 
moan 
moments 

later. The second time came 
when someone described Ana 
as “tenacious” after she spent 
the entire movie being shuffled 
around by the manufactured 
drivel of the plot. Finally came 
the scene in which Ana describes 
Christian as a “man of honor.” 
This time I didn’t even try to 
hold my laughter in.

Both 
of 
these 
dunces 

immediately 
assume 
that 

whenever their partner spends 
time with a member of the 
opposite sex, they’re cheating. 
That’s not marriage; that’s high 
school, and they never change. 
As the end credits roll, these are 
the same reprehensible people 
we started with, yet the movie 
is hellbent on convincing its 
audience that this, this is what 
true love looks like. “Fifty Shades 
Freed” is toxic. It’s harmful. 
It’s awful. It lacks any sort of 
self-awareness or redeemable 
qualities. “Tenacious?” “Man of 
honor?” Give me a damn break.

guide to seeing ‘Fifty Shades Freed’

My ongoing love 
for watching the
Olympic Games

If you need to find me over 

the next two weeks, I’ll be 
glued to any screen I can get 
my hands on, live-streaming 
NBC and cheering on the 
U.S.A. in winter sports I only 
aggressively pretend to know 
the slightest about. From the 
moment the torch is lit, it’s 
pure magic for me. While some 
merely view the Olympics 
as an exploitative and over-
hyped money-maker, to me, 
the Games carry an entirely 
different 
connotation 
of 

unity, identity and wholesome 
entertainment.

Now, when I say I love 

watching 
the 
Olympics, 

I 
truly 
mean 
the 
entire 

Olympics. From the opening 
and closing ceremonies to 
any event (no matter how 
obscure or underappreciated), 
I find myself intrigued and 
entranced by the spectacle 
of it all. From the time I was 
eight years old — watching 
legendary athletes like Nastia 
Liukin and Michael Phelps 
make history during the 2008 
Beijing Summer Games — it 
has become a ritual of mine 
to tune in every two years and 
binge-watch the live coverage.

The Olympics always bring 

me back to the nostalgic era 
of TV — you know, the entire 
family gathering in the living 
room unit, everyone adding 
their two cents and critiques 
of what’s on the screen. In my 
family, that picture usually 
goes a little something like 
this: me holding my breath 
every time a figure skater 
leaves 
the 
ground, 
my 

parents becoming overnight 
“experts” 
in 
terminology 

like “triple axel” and “luge” 
and 
my 
brother 
laughing 

along with Twitter at some 
hilariously awkward Olympics 
commentary.

In that way, the experience 

of watching the Olympics on 
TV is unquestionably a valued 
tradition shared with family, 
but it expands into something 
much bigger than that. It’s an 
experience shared with the 
nation, and even more notably, 
the 
entire 
world. 
Rooting 

for your home country and 
engaging in the pure anxiety 
and excitement that stems from 
an international competition 
is 
simply 
a 
timeless 
and 

universal phenomenon.

Suddenly, even the most 

indifferent and uninformed 
citizens 
shapeshift 
into 

patriots, feeling proud that 
their athletes can accomplish 
what others can’t. While social 
media is normally a space for 
heavy-handed 
criticism 
of 

America and its culture, when 
the Olympics are on, red, 
white and blue overwhelm 
the airwaves and a truly 
magnificent sense of unity 
and 
togetherness 
ignites. 

Guys in full-body U.S.A. garb, 
no shortage of American flag 
emojis and those tear-jerking 
P&G commercials on repeat — 
every Olympic Games marks a 
surge in the allegiance to an 
endorsement of our country. 
And admittedly, while that 
outpouring can be a little 
pretentious and overkill at 
times, it is still exhilarating 
and 
heartwarming 

nonetheless.

Besides feeling as though 

you are a part of history and 
partaking 
in 
the 
cultural 

extravaganza 
that 
is 
the 

Olympics, the idealized nature 
of the Games is yet another 
enthralling aspect of watching 
them on TV. There’s just 
something 
so 
encouraging 

about seeing people (make 
that very young people) fulfill 
their dreams and accomplish 
their lifelong goals on such 
a global platform. Sitting in 
front of the TV, seeing all the 
action unfold and watching 
fantasies become realities has 

the indescribable ability to 
make you feel all warm and 
fuzzy inside. Ultimately, what 
it boils down to is that it’s just 
refreshing to see people do 
good on TV for a change.

Dumbfounded 
comments 

like, “I can’t believe humans 
are actually capable of doing 
that,” and, “I seriously wish 
I could do that,” frequently 
flood the scene during those 
two weeks. And just like that, I 
(along with the rest of America) 
start having visions of getting 
into 
a 
sport, 
becoming 
a 

prodigy and winning gold. 
Unfortunately, I think I’m past 
my prime. Also unfortunately, 
I’m just extremely unathletic 
and talentless. Sure, maybe 
watching the Olympics can 

destroy your self-esteem in 
an instant, but it can also 
motivate you to be better.

The final and perhaps most 

curious draw to watching the 
Olympics is the presentation 
of diversity on our screens 
for those few weeks. Stellar 
athletes 
of 
all 
races 
and 

backgrounds are (for a change) 
evaluated based on their skill 
sets and dedication, not their 
socially constructed statuses. 
Distinctly, this winter’s Team 
U.S.A. is bringing the largest 
and most diverse squad of 
athletes to the Winter Games, 
advocating 
for 
inclusivity 

alongside their usual standard 
of excellence.

All of a sudden the world 

realizes 
that 
women 
are 

determined 
and 
proficient 

athletes, that your age does 
not define your capability and 
that there are a multitude of 
unique and underrated sports 
out there. The Olympics seem 
to not only make society 
more 
open-minded 
and 

appreciative, 
but 
also 
the 

normally strict and tradition-
keeping world of sports. In 
fact, for almost three decades 
now 
the 
Winter 
Olympics 

has 
pushed 
for 
women’s 

involvement, knocking down 
barriers to previously male-
exclusive sports like hockey 
and curling. Similarly, figure 
skater 
Adam 
Rippon 
and 

freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy 
are breaking massive cultural 
ground this year by being the 
first openly gay male Winter 
Olympic athletes. If it takes 
something as extravagant as 
the Olympics to knock some 
sense into society and make 
representation 
clear 
and 

prominent, then, hey, even 
more power to them.

Overall, 
watching 
this 

year’s PyeongChang Winter 
Olympics is shaping up to be 
a jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring 
global 
moment. 
With 
the 

deluge of media coverage and 
countless new ways to tune 
into the Games, watching the 
Olympics 
has 
triumphantly 

evolved 
from 
a 
simple 

presentation of international 
competition 
to 
a 
more 

interactive, hopeful and pride-
filled TV experience. If that — 
combined with the fact that for 
two weeks you have the perfect 
excuse to procrastinate any 
effort-involving task — doesn’t 
make you want to tune in, then 
where’s your sense of Olympic 
spirit?

UNIVERSAL STUDIOS

5A — Monday, February 12, 2018
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com


The cinematic fixation with 
paranormal 
romance 
that 
blossomed uncontrollably in the 
late 2000s can be traced back to 
the iconic literary masterpiece 
that started it all: “Twilight.” 
When Stephanie Meyer’s best-
selling young adult novel was 
adapted into a film saga, teenage 
hearts 
across 
the 
country 
were revived through Robert 
Pattinson’s (“Remember Me”) 
portrayal of Edward Cullen — the 
flawless, brooding vampire and 
love interest of the protagonist, 
played by Kristen Stewart (“Snow 
White 
and 
the 
Huntsman”). 
“Twilight” 
and 
its 
sequels 
dominated teenage culture, but 
the film had the apparent side-
effect of trapping Stewart and 
Pattinson within their roles of 
Bella and Edward, a common 
repercussion for young actors who 
personify a teenage fandom. After 
“Twilight,” Pattinson struggled 
to be identified as a legitimate 
actor, not just ‘the hot vampire 
from “Twilight.”’ In Pattinson’s 
audition for the film “Good Time,” 
he altered his accent to match 
that of the character, attempting 
to further distance himself from 
his previous role and obtain the 
part on merit. Pattinson’s lead 
role in the film gifts him with 
a shot at validating his acting 
potential to audiences and the 
film community as a whole.
The best way to describe “Good 
Time” is perhaps as an urban 
version of “What’s Eating Gilbert 
Grape,” but darker. Much, much 
darker. Foreshadowing the jerky, 

spur-into-action style that persists 
throughout the remainder of the 
film, one of the first sequences 
involves a robbery committed 
by two brothers, Connie, the 
instigator of the crime, and Nick, 
who lies somewhere on the autism 
spectrum and is not fully aware 
of the dangerous situation he is 
involved in. Ultimately ending up 
in a high-speed chase with the 
police, Nick is caught and sent 
to prison. Connie manages to 
evade the cops, but motivated by 
his rightful guilt and love for his 
brother, he embarks on a mission 
through the maze that is the dark, 
neon-lit New York City streets 
to obtain bail money for Nick, 
spinning a web of messes and 
destruction behind him.
“Good Time” is Pattinson’s 
opportunity to break the mold 
that he has been cast within 
— and break the mold he does. 
In fact, he shatters it. After 
watching this film, it is impossible 
for audiences to merely pass 
Pattinson off as ‘that vampire 
guy’ 
any 
longer. 
Practically 
the anti-“Twilight” in terms of 
acting, 
Pattinson’s 
expression 
of 
Connie 
as 
a 
desperate, 
manipulative 
and 
exploitative 
young man gives viewers a 
character they can chew on. 
Connie is someone that audiences 
are unclear whether or not to 
root for. Unsettled by Connie’s 
slimy and sketchy actions and 
unsavory usage of the individuals 
he 
encounters, 
viewers 
may 
admire the lengths he is willing 
to go to free his brother, that is, 
until they remember that his 
brother’s misfortune is entirely 
Connie’s fault. Pattinson provides 
movie-goers a character that 

gives us whiplash. We scorn at his 
impulsivity and shoddy attempts 
to repair the damage he causes 
over the course of his travels, yet 
we also cross our fingers, hoping 
that he makes it out unscathed in 
the end. 
It is somewhat understandable 
why this film did not receive 
an Oscar or Golden Globe best 
picture 
nomination. 
Viewers 
tend to gravitate toward films 
with 
characters 
who 
grow 
on screen, especially evident 
through this year’s batch of 
nominations, including coming-
of-age films “Lady Bird” and “Call 
Me by Your Name.” However, 
the 
failure 
to 
acknowledge 
Pattinson for his performance 
here is without a doubt an 
oversight. The dimension that 
Pattinson 
generates 
through 
his embodiment of Connie is 
fantastic. The idea of a ‘repulsive 
hero’ sounds paradoxical, but that 
is exactly what Pattinson offers 
the audience in “Good Time” — 
a moral-free, low-life swindler 
that, despite his personality flaws, 
is still capable of feeling a pure, 
untainted love for another human 
being.
There is absolutely nothing 
feel-good about this film, and it is 
in no way redemptive. However, 
though it leaves viewers with knots 
in their stomachs, it convinces 
them that Robert Pattinson can 
no longer be identified solely as 
another insignificant actor within 
the paranormal genre. Pattinson 
proves his acting prowess by 
shedding his longtime branding 
as “Edward” and coming into 
his own, and it is a true pity that 
he did not receive the credit he 
deserved.

Modern music seems to

about 
crossovers — how do artists 
combine 
genres, 
and 
how 
do those new and unique 
combinations 
serve 
to 
revitalize seemingly defunct 
subsets of the musical sphere? 
It’s been a tough century 
for emos so far — a soaring, 

climactic decade at the turn 
of 
the 
2000s 
filled 
with 
flourishing, 
aggressively

abruptly 

followed 
by 
a 
plague

has grown several different 
limbs, 
including, 
but 
not 
limited to, alternative pop, 
emo 
self-made 
Soundcloud 
artists and softened emo rock.
Now, I’m all for music

Crooked Shadows

Dashboard 
Confessional 

Fueled by Ramen

its empire on early 2000s “emo 
acoustic punk,” embracing the 
slowed down guitar chords 
that characterized the era. 
Their latest release Crooked 
Shadows is an effort to show 
off a more grown-up version of 
that raw emotion to the world; 
however, because of the huge 
gap that exists between the 
last release and this one, the 
contrast is more of a gulf than 
a seamless transition between 
styles. If you were to listen 
to Dashboard Confessional’s 
discography in order of release, 
you’d definitely be able to tell 
when the hiatus happened.
Crooked 
Shadows 
starts 
plainly 
enough 
with 
“We 
Fight,” a track that gradually 
moves from a somewhat bland 
ticking beat to a rousing chorus. 
First and foremost, lead singer 
Chris Carrabba’s voice has lost 
the gentle, tender vulnerability 
embodied 
by 
old 
tracks 
such as Dusk and Summer’s 
“Stolen,” instead adopting a 
gritty aggressiveness that is 
reminiscent of a crunchier, 
more roughed up OneRepublic.
Sadly, 
Crooked 
Shadows’s 
biggest disappointment was 

also what I’d been most excited 
for — the collaboration with 
Lindsey 
Stirling. 
Stirling’s 

unique calling card is how 
she manages to twist classical 
violin 
into 
producing 
all 
kinds of new, fiercely badass 

sounds. However, “Open My 
Eyes” is sorely lacking in the 
balanced intensity and energy 
that I’ve come to expect from 
music associated with Stirling. 
The result is an appallingly 
lukewarm track that sounds 
like 
a 
pop 
song 
with 
a 
violin added in — perhaps 
a sad attempt at imitating 
Yellowcard’s 
violin 
infused 
style — rather than an effort to 
create something that would 
truly stand the test of time.
Albums

Yaa Gyasi explores home 
and history in ‘Homegoing’

A pristine white castle, in 
all its majesty, claims its place 
on the Gold Coast in Ghana. 
Magnificent on the outside, 
inspiration struck from the 
cold 
underbelly. 
While 
the 
perfection on the outside was 
unchanging, Yaa Gyasi spoke of 
the smell that still today plagues 
the dungeons of the castle. The 
lingering smell of wrongdoings, 
of evil that endured while above 
colonial wealth thrived. It was 
during these 20 minutes that 
Yaa Gyasi spent in the castle 
where the story of “Homegoing” 
began. A haunted castle that 
reveals the curse of slavery; a 
beginning that we wish to be 
just a fable.
Yaa Gyasi’s unfaltering voice 
filled the Rackham auditorium 

accompanied 
by 
the 
silent 
attention of many Ann Arbor 
fans this past Tuesday. Opening 
the night with a reading, Gyasi’s 
voice emphasized the strong 
presence of time in her novel. As 
she read aloud, her voice had a 
fluidity and tranquility — beauty 
stemmed from a borderline 
monotony. Her voice always 
marching 
forward, 
without 
lingering or rushing, mimicking 
time. Just as the structure of the 
book spends an equal amount 
of pages on each character, 
Gyasi spoke with an entrancing 

consistency. 
Structural 
predictability mimic the ticking 
of a clock — the passing of days, 
to years, to seven generations, 
to tie together the lives of 14 
individuals.
The night was intended to be 
a conversation with Yaa Gyasi 
and two University professors. 
While at times the questions 
were thought provoking, some 
felt as though the professors 
were trying to get a specific 
response from Gyasi regarding 
her own work. Gyasi, however, 
remained authentic and relaxed 
in her responses regardless of 
the moments when the structure 
of the lecture was pushing on.
Yaa 
Gyasi 
spoke 
of 
her 
research, inspiration and ideas 
with an unrehearsed elegance. 
She was humorous in her self 
reflection, 
joking 
with 
the 
audience while allowing them to 
relate on a personal level. Gyasi 
recalled the day she walked 
into the castle in Ghana. She 
described the castle’s beautiful 
outside, only to then be shown 
the dungeon, which still reeked 
of history’s wrongdoings.
Many 
themes 
surfaced 
throughout 
the 
night. 
The 
meaning 
of 
freedom, 
inheritance and home all came 
into question. Gyasi focuses on 
more than just legal bondages, 
the inheritance of trauma and 
the true expanse of home, 
constantly going beyond the 
physical. It is in the emotional 
and the spiritual that her 
novel has captivated so many. 
Through these aspects, people 
of all backgrounds can relate 
to and understand the story 
beyond historical facts.
Every individual has their 
own unique history that goes 
beyond 
their 
own 
lifespan. 
The connection we feel to our 
ancestors drives the feeling that 
life is more than just biology — 
an unexplainable inheritance 
that we feel, that we do not have 
to know. While an unintended 
consequence, Gyasi spoke of 
how many people have talked 

to her about their decision 
to purchase a 23andMe DNA 
testing kit. The reaction of 
Gyasi’s readers to go in search 

of their own heritage speaks to 
the profound power of ancestry 
portrayed in the novel.
Gyasi spoke of how she grew 
up with “Homegoing.” While 
she never felt she could claim 
Ghana as a home, having moved 
away at two years old, she did not 
feel like the United States was 
home either. But what if home 
can be more than somewhere 
you point to on a map, more 
than the place you think owns 
you? The term “homegoing” 
refers to the African American 
funeral tradition which revolves 
around the idea that once you 
die, your soul returns home. The 
funeral ritual is a celebration 
of 
the 
deceased 
returning 
home. Among the many themes 
“Homegoing” reflects on, this 
one lingers: Home can be people, 
a collection of places, a feeling, a 
security or even yourself. Home 
does not need to be a physical 
place; home can be inside of you.

Hot first half 

propels ‘M’ to win 

MADISON — On Sunday afternoon, Kohl 

Center had all the makings of a big matchup: a 
raucous crowd, highlight reels on the jumbotron 
and the suspense of an intense rivalry.

And then the game began.
Sophomore point guard Zavier Simpson put his 

finesse moves to good use, bullying his defender 
in the lane for the game’s first two points. Then 
Simpson rifled an outlet pass to Charles Matthews 
for an easy layup — one of six assists on the day for 
the sophomore. A Duncan Robinson 3-pointer 
followed for a 7-0 lead 2:28 into the contest.

It would be that kind of game for the No. 20 

Michigan men’s basketball team — it was bigger 
and better than Wisconsin and could score points 
any way it wanted. The Wolverines (9-5 Big Ten, 
20-7 overall) nearly surrendered their 23-point 
lead when their offense relaxed, but they made 
the necessary stops to get a reprieve from a recent 
offensive slump to trample the underperforming 
Badgers (4-10, 11-16), 83-72. It was just coach John 
Beilein’s second win in Madison in his 11-year 
tenure.

“Our defense in the first half was very, very 

good. Second half, not as good,” Beilein said. 
“(Defense is) tough to play with that type of lead. 
We’ve been in this building before and we got 
up, then they made a run and we did not execute 
down the stretch and melted a little bit. These guys 
would not go away tonight.”

After the first seven points, Michigan hit the 

gas pedal even harder. In a fluid 2:02 sequence, the 
Wolverines recovered from a broken offensive set 
to convert an alley-oop for Moritz Wagner, then 
proceeded to knock down three consecutive deep 
balls.

Two of them came off the hands of Robinson, 

who entered the starting lineup due to an ankle 

injury to freshman forward Isaiah Livers. The 
fifth-year senior was removed as a starter on Jan. 
13 against Michigan State, and he welcomed the 
return with 16 points, hitting his first four threes 
in the process.

And for the first time this season — partially 

a byproduct of Livers’ absence — Wagner and 
sophomore center Jon Teske saw the floor 
together for the first time all year. The added 
height was also a measure to contain Wisconsin’s 
Ethan Happ, the Badgers’ lone source of scoring 
with 29 points.

“A scary few minutes right there, we’ve got this 

guy chasing guys around the perimeter,” Beilein 
joked, pointing at Wagner beside him. “They 
really did good (and) you could see it more. They 
understand that there are some teams — and this 
team is one — where it’s a good matchup for us.

“The whole idea today was “How are we going 

to keep ‘Happ from getting 40?’ and I don’t think 
we did a great job with that. … When we lost Isaiah 
Livers we knew that (Wagner) might have to play 
some ‘4’ and now he’s not getting more rest.”

It was a mish-mash of new lineups and unusual 

scenes in the first 20 minutes, but it amounted to 
a lights-out 17-for-26 from the field and a 44-22 
halftime lead.

In the second half, the onslaught continued. 

While Happ continued to work Michigan’s 
frontcourt, Wagner responded in kind with seven 
of the Wolverines’ first 11 points, including an 
off-balance, shot clock-beating trey as part of his 
20-point, 11-board double-double.

But with 11:46 remaining up 21, a repressed 

memory of blowing a 20-point lead at Ohio State 
resurfaced. Happ and teammate Nate Reuvers 
went on a 10-0 run by themselves, before a layup by 
senior guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
quieted a restless crowd. Wisconsin scored again, 
then Abdur-Rahkman dished a no-look pass to 
Wagner for a dunk. And then it happened once 
more, this time a step-back dagger by the senior. 

Michigan’s 
lead would 
never 
sink 

below 
seven 

for the rest of the 
game.Wisconsin 
tried to continue 
its 
comeback 

efforts with a “hack-
a-Simpson” strategy, 
intentionally fouling 
the point guard with 
3:08 remaining. While it 
worked twice, as he missed the 
front ends of two one-and-ones, the Badgers 
couldn’t capitalize before he was substituted out.

“All programs in the Big Ten are really good 

programs so we know they’re gonna make a run 
late,” Robinson said. “Teams aren’t just gonna 
wilt away. We’ve got to do a little bit better job in a 
couple areas, not fouling 3-point shooters and stuff 
like that. You get experience through games like 
this. Fortunately, we were able to get a win in 
this one, but we’ve gotta continue to tighten 
up our free throw shooting and staying 
connected on defense in those type of 
situations.”

Sunday’s game may have had 

all the reverie of a high-stakes 
contest — a prolific shooting 
display, a valiant comeback 
and a rightful winner. But it 
was truly Michigan’s game 
from the start, and it took 
care of business exactly 
as it needed to to keep 
its NCAA Tournament 
aspirations alive.

T

here’s a small family-
owned deli on Long Island 

— tucked in 
between a 
pizzeria and 
a liquor store 
— in the town 
of Rockville 
Centre.

It has 

a stone 
storefront and 
lounge chairs 
you’d probably 
see more often in a backyard than 
on the sidewalk. Drive by at night, 
and you’ll find four overhanging 
lamps spotlighting the words 
“Greystone Delicatessen.”

Walk inside and there are wood 

floors, with chalkboards hanging 
across the right wall listing every 
item on the menu.

There are two people currently 

residing in Ann Arbor who have 
worked at this deli.

One came to Michigan and 

decided to write for his student 
newspaper. That’s me.

The other?
Kevin Conry, the new head 

coach of the Michigan men’s 
lacrosse team.

***
Warde Manuel doesn’t 

remember exactly who 
recommended that he sit down 
with Conry, but he does remember 
that Conry was the first assistant 
coach brought to his attention.

It’s easy to imagine why that 

was the case.

Conry graduated from Johns 

Hopkins — where he was a four-
year member of the Blue Jays’ 
lacrosse team — before embarking 
on his coaching journey that saw 
him make stops at Siena, Penn 
State, Fairfield and, most recently, 
Maryland. It’s at all of those stops 
that Conry says he “sharpened the 
knife” of his values.

Conry’s professional 

aspirations were always to be 
a head coach. And Michigan 
offered similar resources with the 
chance for him to build a program 
of his own.

He finished his final season at 

Maryland — one that ended in a 
national championship — before 
turning toward the future. Staying 
in the present, he says, was 
something he said he owed to his 
players.

But eventually he went to 

administrators at Maryland, 
asking if the Michigan job was still 
open. It was, and through a series 
of connections, Conry ended up 
sitting down with Manuel in Ann 
Arbor.

“This is a Big Ten university 

with unbelievable facilities,” 
he says. “It has an unbelievable 
academic and athletic reputation, 
so when you’re looking around 
you’re saying, ‘Oh man, that would 
be a gem.’ And I was just fortunate 
to be in the running of that one. 
Why now? It was just all the stars 
aligned.”

And on June 21, it became 

official. Conry was taking over the 
program, and he made sure to call 

each of his future players to let 
them know.

***
If you were to walk past 

Michigan’s locker room Saturday, 
in the bowels of the newly-
constructed U-M Lacrosse 
Stadium, you would have found a 
somewhat peculiar sight.

Members of the Wolverines 

— fresh off a 15-5 victory over 
Cleveland State in their season 
opener and dressed in postgame 
suits — walked the hall picking up 
stray pieces of athletic tape.

It seems innocuous enough, 

but the scene is emblematic of 
the broader principles Conry has 
begun to instill.

As Brent Noseworthy 

describes, he has had to pick up 
other people’s garbage. His new 
coach is insistent that the team 
leaves places better than they 
found it — whether that be a bus, 
a hotel room or a piece of athletic 
equipment.

“How you do anything is how 

you do everything, and that’s 
something Coach Conry has really 
harped on,” Noseworthy says. 
“One of the thing he encourages 
us — make your bed every 
morning, because then you start 
your day off productive and you 
have something done.”

As for Conry’s explanation?
“Much like everything, you 

kind of grow up a certain way,” he 
says. “You kind of grow up with 
that respectful mindset, being 
accountable to all your decisions 
and your mistakes. Part of our 
mission here and what we talk 
about is we’re gonna play the 
game like we live our life and you 
live your life like you play the 
game.”

The culture change doesn’t end 

with garbage duty, though.

Last Friday, Conry had the 

freshman class and his senior 
captains over for dinner.

Noseworthy says he thinks 

the plan is to make sure every 
class goes over at least once, and 
that in the first iteration, the 
team spent time meeting Conry’s 
family. The assistant coaches 
brought their kids over too.

The food wasn’t bad either, 

complete with a spread of flank 
steaks, chicken, pasta and mac and 
cheese.

“It’s catered,” joked freshman 

Alex Buckanavage. “He doesn’t 
know how to cook.”

“I punted on that one,” Conry 

admits. “I couldn’t put that one on 
Mrs. Conry.”

Home-cooking or not, the 

purpose behind the dinner 
remains the same.

“I think we want to foster 

more of a family environment,” 
Conry says. “I want them to 
know my kids and watch my 
kids kind of grow up around this 
program. … But I want to build 
a championship culture, and 
everything that’s entitled to it. 

Part of it is the family orientation, 
but it’s also just excelling at 
the smallest details in every 
department.”

***
Look around the Big Ten, 

and you’ll quickly come to a 
realization. Five teams are 
currently ranked in the top 20 
nationally. Michigan, the sixth, is 
not one of them.

The growth will have to come 

incrementally. No one is blind to 
that.

“The expectations were high,” 

says Warde Manuel, “while at 
the same time understanding, it’s 
not just gonna be built overnight 
because we have a new stadium, 
and now we’re gonna all of a 
sudden win.”

Conry admits that, as a first-

time head coach, there are some 
things that no amount of advice 
can prepare you for. He says the 
best coaches, in his mind, adjust to 
those mistakes.

But there’s a sense of humor 

mixed in with the introspection.

He’ll say he misses bagels, 

pizza, crab and his family on the 
East Coast. But lacrosse and film 
study, he’ll joke again, have filled 
the void and improved his diet.

If Saturday was any indication, 

though, he’s been looking at more 
than just lacrosse and film since 
June.

“I’m a relationship guy,” Conry 

says. “… The relationships of life 
is what you take away. Everybody 
leaves a little coin in the well of 
your life and so you kind of build 
that foundation from there. For 
these guys, I’m gonna be around 
them 20-something hours a week 
to make sure I’m always a steady 
presence in their lives.

“They want to make sure they 

know me, get to know me for real, 
and build a foundation of success 
around it.”

Michigan men’s lacrosse coach Kevin Conry is trying to build the program in his first year in Ann Arbor after serving as an assistant coach at Maryland. 

Robinson, hot first half boost Wolverines to road win against Wisconsin

When Zavier Simpson kicked 

the ball out to Duncan Robinson 
in the closing minutes of the 
first half, there was no question 

what was going to happen next.

Even with a defender right in 

his face, 23 feet away from the 
basket, the fifth-year senior 
guard lifted, fired and drained 
a 3-pointer. It was his fourth 
triple of afternoon and the 

final piece of a nearly perfect, 
4-for-5 effort from beyond the 
arc in the first half.

And in a rare display of 

emotion, he let the 15,000-
plus fans in attendance at the 
Kohl Center know it with a 

confident, fist-pump filled jog 
down the floor.

“It felt good just to see some 

go in,” Robinson said.

This 
year, 
Robinson 
has 

probably expected to see a few 
more go in than has been the 

case.

In 
his 
final 
season 
at 

Michigan, the forward has 
lost his starting job and shot 
a career-worst 35 percent 
from the floor. And even 
with 
all 
his 
experience, 

the fifth-year senior hasn’t 
played with the confidence 
one might anticipate. After 
the Wolverines’ victory over 
Rutgers last month, John 
Beilein 
said 
he 
thought 

Robinson was tentative and 
“asking for permission” too 
often.

But in Michigan’s 83-72 

victory 
over 
Wisconsin, 

Robinson refused to ask for 
anything — even when recent 
history suggested he could 

have — scoring 16 points on 
5-for-9 shooting in 37 minutes.

“Duncan’s a great shooter, 

and we know that,” said junior 
forward Mortiz Wagner, “so 
I’m very happy his shots were 
going down.”

Robinson’s 
struggles 
had 

hit possibly their lowest point 
prior 
to 
Sunday’s 
contest, 

having made just two of his last 
13 triple attempts the past three 
games. Yet, with the injury 
to freshman forward Isaiah 
Livers, Robinson was thrust 
back on the starting lineup 
Sunday, where the Wolverines 
needed him to perform.

And channeling a strong 

performance in practice from 
earlier this week, he did just 
that.

“The other day, there was 

the goal of making 48 3s in 
four minutes. He made 50 out 
of 55 shots on the run moving,” 
Beilein said. “I know he can 
really shoot the ball, and I 
encourage him to shoot the 
ball. He did today.”

Like 

Robinson, 
Michigan 
has 

had 
its 
fair 

share of recent 
offensive 
struggles. 
The 

Wolverines shot 
just 5-for-20 in 
the second half 
of Tuesday’s loss 
at Northwestern 
— 
part 
of 
a 

three-game stretch where they 
averaged just 62 points-per-
game.

But 
it 
wasn’t 
that 
type 

of 
afternoon 
Sunday. 
Two 

minutes 
and 
change 
in, 

Robinson 
collected 
himself 

and knocked down a 3-pointer 
to put the Wolverines up, 7-0. 
Minutes later, that advantage 
would grow to 15-2 when a 
pick-and-roll set up an open 
look for Wagner, who splashed 
his first of three triples on the 
day.

That type of ball movement 

was the clear difference from 
the Northwestern loss, when 

the Wolverines often resorted 
to 
1-on-1 
play 
when 
they 

couldn’t immediately solve the 
Wildcats’ 2-3 zone defense.

Instead, Michigan assisted 

on 
all 
eight 
of 
its 
made 

3-pointers in the first half 
Sunday, as sound passing even 
created shots for players who 
seldom 
get 
them. 
Midway 

through the first half, fifth-
year 
senior 
guard 
Jaaron 

Simmons hit his first triple 
since Nov. 29 after catching a 
kick-out pass from Wagner for 
an open look.

Michigan 
went 
17-for-26 

from the field to score 44 points 
in the opening frame — its most 
in the first half since Jan. 2 at 
Iowa (48).

“We know that it (would) 

correct itself, and we got really 
good shooters on the team, and 
we’ve got really good passers,” 
Beilein said.

That shooting touch evaded 

the Wolverines at some points 
in final 20 minutes, allowing 
the Badgers to cut deficit to 

single 
digits. 

But 
the 
ball 

movement 
didn’t.

With 

Wisconsin 
threatening, 
senior 
guard 

Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman 
threaded 
the 

needle to diving 

Wagner for a dunk, giving 
Michigan a 13-point lead with 
less than eight minutes to play.

The Badgers would make 

addition 
comeback 
efforts 

from there, but near perfect 
free-throw shooting down the 
stretch gave Michigan the win 
it needed to have.

“It really feels good just to 

have our guys just go out there 
and play,” Beilein said.

And behind on the best 

passing performances in some 
time, 
that’s 
exactly 
what 

Robinson and the Wolverines 
did Sunday — no question about 
it.

Monday, February 12, 2018 — 3B

Two dominant wins Friday. 

Two harrowing losses Saturday. 
A closeout win and a sigh of relief 
Sunday.

For the softball team, it was 

déjà vu.

Opening their season in the 

annual 
USF 
Wilson-Demarini 

Tournament, 
the 
Wolverines 

tallied three wins and two losses 
over the span of three days. 
Similar to the year prior, the team 
put on a first-day show, only to let 
the next two closely-contested 
games slip away before bouncing 
back with a convincing win.

The difference? This year’s 

team 
is 
younger 
and 
less 

experienced but has plenty of 
room to grow.

On Friday, Michigan posted 

back-to-back 
shutouts 
— 
7-0 

against 
Alabama-Birmingham 

and 8-0 against Georgia State 
— through the efforts of senior 
starting right-hander and first 
baseman 
Tera 
Blanco 
and 

freshman left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien.

In an otherwise stressless 

day, the biggest scare for the 
Wolverines came at the end of their 
first game against the Blazers. 
After Blanco had weathered the 
storm by keeping UAB scoreless 
through seven innings, Beaubien 
came in for her first collegiate 
appearance to close it, attempting 
to hold a 7-0 lead.

Throwing 
her 
first 
pitch, 

Beaubien hit the batter squarely 
in the chest, awarding the UAB 
hitter first base. Shortly after, 
she allowed consecutive infield 
and right field singles to load the 
bases.

Facing the pressure of loaded 

bases and a potential comeback, 
though, was no scare for the 
freshman, as she struck out 
two Blazers before forcing a 
groundout to second.

“Just one pitch at a time, you 

know, go after the hitters, trust 
my defense, don’t think too hard 
about the runners on base or the 
next batter coming up,” Beaubien 
said. “Just one pitch at a time and 
relax.”

Her mentality gave her the 

start against Georgia State, where 
she pitched a six-inning no hitter. 
Her defense, however, paved the 
way for her success, allowing her 
to pitch with little to no pressure.

Up five at the bottom of the 

fifth, senior utility player Aidan 
Falk dove to the ground in pursuit 
of the ball. With a one-handed 
grab, she came up with the play 
— one of many crowd-stirring 
defensive play — to further 
prevent any chances of an upset 
from the Panthers.

Despite the shutout, there were 

mistakes here and there.

But to Michigan coach Carol 

Hutchins, those mistakes were 
necessary to show the team that it 
still had room to improve.

“You know, we saw some 

great moments from our team,” 
Hutchins said. “We had some 
great offense. We had some great 
pitching. We made some great 
defensive plays and played some 
good softball.

“And then I thought we showed 

some signs that there are some 
areas to improve and not just at 
the game of softball. But I told 
them today, I think our mindset 
needs to become more consistent, 
and to have a consistency to our 
game we’re gonna need to have a 
consistency to our minds.”

The lack of consistency in its 

mindset showed after the first day. 
Before Saturday, the Michigan 
offense was rolling. Against UAB, 
Falk had three RBI and two hits. 
Sophomore shortstop Madison 
Uden 
and 
pitch-hitter 
Abby 

Skvarce added an RBI each.

Against 
the 
Panthers, 
the 

Wolverines recorded 12 hits. 
Senior 
utility 
player 
Taylor 

Swearingen recorded two hits, 
using offense to build confidence 
in her defense after she committed 
an error in the field where she 
allowed the ball to bounce off the 
top of her glove.

Junior catcher Katie Alexander 

scored the game deciding run 
before adding another RBI to 
round out her performance on 
Friday.

But the standout of the day, 

was junior second baseman Faith 
Canfield who hit two home runs 
in two games, including a three-
run homer over the left field wall 
against Georgia State. Seeing the 
ball sail over the fence sent a smile 
to Canfield’s face as she crossed 
home plate.

“It felt awesome. I mean, we’ve 

been practicing inside for the past 
month,” Canfield said, “so actually 
getting to see those balls go over 
the fence and not just hitting the 

top of our indoor facilities was 
pretty exciting, felt really good.”

However, 
that 
smile 

disappeared soon after as the 
team faced No. 2 Florida.

Despite 
going 
against 
a 

perennial powerhouse in the 
Gators, Michigan didn’t change 
its approach as it had the two 
preceding games. To the players, 
they were just “going out to play 
softball like they had always 
known.”

“It’s Florida,” Beaubien said, 

“and everyone talks about that 
because they’re such a good 
program, but we don’t approach it 
any differently.”

Just as they had before, the 

Wolverines came out strong. 
Canfield led off with contact, 
which was likely to be a double 
before it was ruled foul. And in 
a moment’s notice, Michigan’s 
offense 
became 
stagnant 
as 

sophomore 
outfielder 
Thais 

Gonzalez popped out to second 
base and Falk grounded out to 
second to cap off the first inning.

Beaubien held Florida to just 

four hits and two runs, but her 
effort wasn’t enough as those two 
runs proved to be all that was 
needed to win. The Wolverines’ 
stagnant offense stranded 10 
total runners on base against the 

Gators and South Florida, many of 
which were in scoring position.

Inning after inning, Michigan 

produced extra base hits.

But whether they had zero 

outs or two outs, the Wolverines 
couldn’t muster a way to convert 
the opportunities. Faced with 
its final set of outs in the seventh 
inning 
down 
two, 
Michigan 

brought out freshman shortstop 
Natalia Rodriguez to try to ignite 
the offense.

Just like her fellow freshman 

Beaubien, pressure proved to be 
ineffective, as she hit a single to 
centerfield. With a runner on first 
and hope in the dugout, the team 
rallied around the possibility of 
tying or winning the game.

“I brought her in the leadoff 

batter and she got on base against 
Florida,” Hutchins said. “That 
was fantastic, high-pressure, that 
is softball at its highest pressure. 
I think she’s a confident kid. I 
think she believes in herself. 
She’s talented, and she’s got that 
great body language that comes 
with it. What we call swag. I like 
that swag. Shows me that she’s 
confident in her abilities.”

But just as quickly as the 

Wolverines’ hopes began, Florida 
ended 
them 
by 
inducing 
a 

groundout by Canfield.

“I thought we had, you know, 

we had a great game against 
Florida, and I liked our mindset,” 
Hutchins said. “I thought we put 
ourselves in a position to win the 
game, and we didn’t win the game, 
but we were in the game to win it.

“And then I did not see that 

out of them in the South Florida 
game. We seemed, it was kind 
of like a letdown type of thing. 
This morning we came out strong 
the first inning but then we shot 
ourselves in the foot almost every 
inning, just cues that I don’t think 
we’re locked in enough.”

Coming out of the bus to go into 

its fourth game in two days, the 
team’s lack of energy was evident.

That lack of energy made all the 

difference.

Despite putting up a fight, the 

Wolverines fell, 3-2, to the Bulls, 
an unexpected loss just like the 
year prior. Finding themselves 
down one late in the game, 
Hutchins made a tough call to 
pull Blanco for Beaubien, relying 
on the left-hander to maintain the 
slim gap.

However, even though the 

defense kept the margin to one, 
the 
offense 
struggled 
again, 

failing to take advantage of an 
opportunity in the seventh, as 
three 
pinch-hitters 
hit 
three 

straight pop outs or groundouts to 
end the game.

Bouncing back from a rough 

loss, the Wolverines proceeded 
to 
convincingly 
beat 
Illinois 

State, 6-1, to end their opening 
tournament run. While the result 
of the weekend might not have 
gone the way the team had hoped, 
there were many takeaways that 
offered a good look at not just 
the strengths of the team, but the 
potential offered by its youth.

“We’re here for one reason, is to 

be locked into play good softball,” 
Hutchins said. “So hopefully, you 
know, it’s a learning curve, and 
there’s a lot of new kids playing 
every game.”

“I think you’re never fully as 

good as you’re going to be,” Canfield 
said. “So I think all around, we 
can sharpen up and if anything, 
just improve our presence, which 
I think will come with time as we 
get more comfortable as the season 
goes on.”

EAST LANSING —With 50 

seconds left against Michigan 
State, 
down 
64-61, 
Kim 

Barnes Arico called a timeout. 
Despite drawing up a plan, the 
Wolverines were unable to get 
off a shot, turning the ball over 
with 36 seconds left.

This left a blank stare of 

frustration on Barnes Arico’s 
face, 
as 
No. 
21 
Michigan 

women’s basketball (9-5 Big 
Ten, 20-7 overall) went on to 
lose, 66-61, to the Spartans 
(5-8, 15-11).

“We were trying to get Hallie 

(Thome) a touch in the post, 
first and foremost, because we 
felt like she was having a lot of 
good one-on-one situations,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Then when 
we didn’t have her to try and 
get Katelynn (Flaherty) off 
a flare screen to a rescreen. 
I think everybody became 
hesitant right there, a couple 
people had some open looks 
and then we just kept passing 
the ball.”

For the first three quarters, 

the Wolverines seemed to leave 
their talents in Ann Arbor.

Michigan was unable to 

sustain 
consistent 
play 
on 

either side of the ball. When 
the offense prospered, the 
defense was ineffective and 
vice versa.

After a 7-0 run to start the 

game, the Wolverines went 
cold. In the final eight minutes 
of the quarter, Michigan scored 
just four points. Excluding 
senior 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty, 
the 
Wolverines 

were out of sync – resulting 
in a 21-11 Michigan State lead. 
Offensively, Flaherty was the 
only one who could convert, 
scoring nine of the Wolverines’ 
11 points. To make matters 
worse, Michigan turned it over 
eight times and struggled in 
transition on defense, allowing 
Michigan State to knock down 
three 3-pointers.

In 
the 
second, 
the 

Wolverines picked up their 
offense by scoring 21 points. 
Unlike 
the 
first 
frame, 

Flaherty struggled and her 
teammates picked up the slack. 
Thome returned to form after 
posting just two points in the 
opening quarter, scoring 10 
points – including six from the 
line.

Despite 
the 
offensive 

turnaround, 
Michigan’s 

defense was still horrendous.

The 
Wolverines 
allowed 

another 
21 
points 
as 
the 

Spartans 
were 
incredibly 

efficient 
from 
the 
field, 

shooting 
50 
percent 
from 

three and 53.3 percent from 
the floor. This impressive play 
had Michigan State up 42-32 at 
the half. When the teams last 
played each other, Michigan 
State scored 48 points in the 
entire game.

The 
second 
half 
wasn’t 

much better.

Just as Michigan cranked 

up its defense by allowing 
only 13 points in the third, its 
offense again went quiet. The 
Wolverines could only muster 
13 points, holding the deficit 
at ten.

Michigan 
showed 
some 

resilience to open the final 
quarter 
by 
quickly 

knocking down 
two 
3-pointers 

– 
cutting 
the 

deficit 
to 

four. 
But, 
the 

Spartans 
held 

tough and never 
surrendered 
their lead.

For 
the 

Wolverines, the 
game itself wasn’t the only 
loss. Freshman forward Hailey 
Brown went down with an 
unknown leg injury and her 
status is to be determined. 

Michigan 
never 
seemed 

to find their groove. The 
Wolverines shot an abysmal 
36 percent from the floor. To 

make matters worse, Michigan 
couldn’t hold onto the ball, 
committing 23 total turnovers.

“(Turnovers) 
that’s 
been 

really the problem,” Barnes 
Arico said. “We work on it 
every day. I think coming into 
the year we really knew that 
might be something that could 
be a problem for us because 

we 
weren’t 

returning 
a 

point guard.”

The 
only 

thing that kept 
the Wolverines 
in 
the 
game 

was 
their 

effectiveness 
from the free 
throw 
line. 

They knocked 
down 21-of-24; 

Thome accounted for nine of 
them.

Despite a successful season, 

Michigan has now lost three 
of its last four. And turnovers 
have been a big part of the poor 
play. If the slide continues, this 
could have them missing out on 
the NCAA Tournament, again.

Michigan out of sync, loses to MSU
Hailey Brown suffers left leg injury

EAST LANSING — A loss 

wasn’t the only calamity the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team suffered on Sunday.

Freshman 
forward 
Hailey 

Brown went down with a lower 
left leg injury late in the fourth 
quarter. Brown was trying to 
defend a transition drive from 
Michigan State’s Branndais Agee 
when the injury occurred.

Brown fell underneath the 

basket 
and 
was 
helped 
off 

without putting weight on her 
left leg. On the bench, a trainer 
put an ice pack around Brown’s 
ankle. She did not return.

Just minutes earlier, Brown 

hit a 3-pointer to bring the 
Wolverines within four points. 
Those were the last of her seven 
points on the day, which Brown 
scored on 3-of-4 shooting from 
the field, the latest in a run of 
impressive performances.

The quietest starter during 

the first part of the season, 
Brown broke out with a 23-point 
performance against Indiana last 

month. She followed that up with 
double-doubles in two of her next 
three games, adding a fourth 
reliable scorer to Michigan’s 
starting trio of senior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty, junior guard 
Nicole Munger and junior center 
Hallie Thome.

Without her, the Wolverines’ 

offense lagged in the game’s 
final minutes. What had looked 
like a promising 
comeback 
lost 
steam, 
as 

Michigan 
blew 

a chance to tie 
the game in the 
last 
minute, 

committing a shot 
clock 
violation. 

Then, with nine 
seconds 
left 
in 

the contest and 
three on the shot 
clock, sophomore 
forward Kayla Robbins fouled the 
Spartans’ Victoria Gaines. Two 
free throws later, any chance for 
a win had evaporated.

“Hailey’s 
a 
great 
3-point 

shooter and she obviously made a 
3 (just before the injury), and you 

know, she’s tough with the pick-
and-pop and the flare screens to 
Kate,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico. “... Definitely not 
having her in at the end of the 
game took away one of our best 
3-point shooters. Next to Kate, 
she’s probably shooting it the best 
of anyone on our team right now.”

Brown will be evaluated in 

the coming days. No immediate 
update 
on 
the 
injury 
was 

provided.

Should 
Brown 
miss 

Wednesday’s 
game 
at 

Minnesota, either Robbins or 
freshman guard Deja Church, 
the only two bench players to 
get consistent minutes for the 
Wolverines, will likely move into 
the starting lineup. Church was 
the immediate replacement for 
Brown, but Robbins also played 
in crunch-time because senior 
forward Jillian Dunston fouled 
out.

It’s hard to overstate the 

potential impact of this injury 
if Brown is out for a significant 
time. Michigan’s last two games 
are in Minneapolis and home 
against Maryland, a top-10 team. 
The Wolverines would have been 
happy to win one of the two with 
a healthy squad. Without Brown, 
disaster looms.

Michigan will likely make the 

NCAA Tournament regardless. 

The Wolverines 
are 34th in RPI 
and the Big Ten 
features a slew 
of 
tournament 

contenders, 
making it hard 
to see a repeat 
of last season 
even 
with 
a 

similar slog to 
the finish.

But finishing 

the year with 

two more losses — and dropping 
five of their last six — would 
open the door to ambiguity 
heading into the Selection Show. 
Michigan lived the perils of such 
a situation last season. Without 
Brown, it might do so again.

Calderone, Marody overcome recent drought with productive weekend

DETROIT, 
Mich. 
— 
The 

Monday after the Michigan 
hockey team swept then-No. 9 
Minnesota, senior forward Tony 
Calderone and junior forward 
Cooper Marody were nominated 
for the Hobey Baker Award, 
which 
recognizes 
college 

hockey’s best player.

That was almost a month ago.
Halfway through the season, 

Calderone had already posted 
a team-high 15 goals, tied for 
seventh in the nation. Marody’s 
31 points led the Big Ten and 
his 22 assists were second-best 
in the country. The duo had 
combined for five points against 
the Golden Gophers, and — along 
with senior forward Dexter 
Dancs — accounted for almost 
40 percent of the Wolverines’ 
total points on the season.

But then the tandem went 

silent.

In the next three weekends, 

Calderone and Marody notched 
only one point between the two 
of them. The pure goal-scorer 
in Calderone and ice general in 
Marody had lost what got them 
recognized in the first place.

Despite contributions from 

secondary scorers in a sweep 
against 
then-No. 
12 
Penn 

State on Jan. 20, Michigan 
wasn’t as fortunate afterward. 
No offensive production ran 
between two of the Wolverines’ 
biggest assets and the team 
began to falter. It was swept at 
then-No. 6 Ohio State and split a 
home series against then-No. 18 
Wisconsin.

Amid a tight race for home-

ice advantage in the Big Ten 
tournament 
and 
PairWise 

positioning 
for 
an 
NCAA 

Tournament berth, Michigan 
couldn’t afford to stumble this 
weekend 
against 
Michigan 

State. It needed Calderone and 
Marody to step up. And they 
rose to the occasion, playing 
prominent roles to help claim 
five of six very important points.

Friday night in East Lansing, 

the Wolverines and Spartans 
played to a 1-1 tie, resulting in 
a shootout to determine which 
team received the extra point in 
the conference standings.

In 
regulation, 
Calderone 

and Marody had two and three 
shots, 
respectively, 
creating 

what 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 

Pearson referred to as “grade-A” 
scoring opportunities. While the 
pair didn’t hit the back of the 
net, they were slowly returning 
to their old form.

After neither team scored 

in the first two rounds of the 
shootout, 
Spartan 
forward 

Patrick Khodorenko’s shot in 
the third round was stopped by 
sophomore goaltender Hayden 
Lavigne.

Then it was up to Calderone to 

clinch the game.

While 
previous 
shootout 

skaters sauntered toward the net 
to try to make a move against 

opposing goaltenders, Calderone 
had other ideas. The senior 
captain 
barreled 
down 
the 

middle of the ice with a full head 
of steam. Head down, Calderone 
quickly moved the puck from 
his backhand to forehand and 
sniped a shot past the glove of 
goaltender John Lethemon and 
right under the crossbar.

Despite the recent drop-off 

in scoring, Calderone wasn’t 
deterred to change his shootout 
approach. 
And 
following 

dormancy since mid-January, 
he believes the game-winner is 
vital to his confidence down the 
regular season’s homestretch.

“(Assistant 
coach 
Brian 

Wiseman) always tells me I’m 
a shooter, so I tried to pick 
up some speed, get the goalie 
backing up a little bit and I was 
lucky enough to get it in there,” 
Calderone said after Friday’s 
game. “I think it’s easy to get 
frustrated 
when 
you’re 
not 

putting in the puck, but I have to 
get back to basics, keep my feet 
moving and hopefully that goal 
can give me some confidence.”

While the Spartan crowd was 

silenced, the Wolverines were 
whipped into a frenzy. As the 
team skated out to celebrate 
with Calderone, Pearson and his 
assistant coaches came together 
for a group hug and jumped up 
and down. The coach then ran 
out onto the ice and embraced 
his captain.

When asked why he showed 

that much emotion, a usually 
even-keeled 
Pearson 
didn’t 

respond about the crucial Big 
Ten point won or defeating an 
in-state rival. He was just as 
elated for the hard-working 
Calderone for getting back on 
track.

“It’s good for Tony because, 

let’s face it, he’s been struggling 
lately,” Pearson said. “For him to 
go in and shoot that puck like he 

did, he made it look easy and like 
he’s done it a thousand times. 
The ice was bad, but that was 
pure Tony and hopefully that 
gives him a bit of a lift here going 
forward.”

The 
next 
night, 
it 
was 

Marody’s turn.

Four minutes and 22 seconds 

into the first period, sophomore 
defenseman 
Griffin 
Luce 

blasted a shot from the point 
that bounced off Lethemon’s 
pads and found its way to 
Calderone in the left circle. Just 
as the Spartan goaltender inched 
outside the crease to make a 
play on Calderone, the senior 
directed a pass to the middle of 
the ice for a streaking Marody.

Marody wouldn’t miss a beat, 

tapping the puck into a wide-
open net to put the Wolverines 
on the board. With a fist pump 
from his knee and a jump into 
the boards, Marody breathed 
life into the Michigan offense 

and energized the Wolverine 
faithful scattered around Little 
Caesars Arena.

“(Cooper’s) 
a 
phenomenal 

player,” Pearson said following 
Saturday’s 
3-2 
victory. 
“He 

should’ve had, I think, five or six 
points tonight.”

For the rest of the contest, 

Calderone and Marody applied 
two-way 
pressure 
on 
the 

Spartans. Each finished with 
four shots on goal, many crisp 
passes 
and 
defensive 
stops, 

all contributing to plus-minus 
ratings of plus-two for both 
skaters in the win.

Calderone’s assist in the first 

frame was his first point since 
Jan. 13 at Minnesota. Marody’s 
goal and assist gives him just 
three points in the last eight 
games.

Yet despite the recent setbacks 

in point production, Calderone 
and Marody kept playing with 
the same intensity and grit that 
originally earned them Hobey 
Baker Award nominations.

“You have to trust yourself 

that you’re a good player,” 
Pearson said. “You have to have 
that inner confidence … and the 
points will come. You have to do 
A, B, C, D and then when you get 
the opportunities, make them 
count.

“And they’ve played well, it’s 

not like they haven’t played well, 
things just haven’t gone in. But 
I thought they had a real good 
weekend, both of them, both 
nights.”

How reassuring was it for 

Pearson to have Calderone and 
Marody show up in such a big 
way this weekend?

“You knew it was going to 

happen, they’re good hockey 
players,” Pearson said. “If you’ve 
ever played the game, you’re all 
going to go through moments 
where things maybe don’t go 
your way. It can be for a short 
period of time or it can be for an 
extended period of time.

“I think the time is over. I’m 

going to tell them it’s over.”

Wolverines claim nailbiter over Michigan State

DETROIT, 
Mich. 
— 
Over 

the last two months, Hayden 
Lavigne has asserted himself as 
Michigan’s starting goaltender, 
and has often had to stand on his 
head to bail out his team.

Saturday night, it was Joseph 

Cecconi’s turn.

With under three minutes to 

play and the Wolverines leading 
Michigan State, 3-2, Spartan 
forward Cody Milan jumped on a 
rebound after two Lavigne saves 
and sent the puck towards the net 
with the sophomore goaltender 
out of position.

In Lavigne’s place, however, 

was Cecconi, who caught the 
puck with his right hand just 
before it could cross the plane, 
tossing it out of the crease as he 
fell to prevent a penalty.

“I’ve had maybe one or two of 

those but that was probably the 
best one,” Cecconi said. “... Once 
I saw the replay I knew that it 
wasn’t a goal.”

The ensuing official review 

proved the junior defenseman 
correct, and Cecconi’s heads-up 
play allowed Michigan (9-10-
3 Big Ten, 14-13-3 overall) to 
escape with the Iron D Trophy 
and a 3-2 victory over Michigan 
State (4-14-2, 10-18-2) at Little 
Caesars Arena on Saturday night.

The game’s early going seemed 

to hint at a higher-scoring game 
than Friday night’s 1-1 tie in 
East Lansing. Five minutes in, 
sophomore defenseman Griffin 
Luce boomed a shot from the 
point that bounced off John 
Lethemon’s pads and to senior 
forward Tony Calderone just 
outside the left post. When the 
Spartan goaltender came over to 
defend him, Calderone dumped 
an easy pass into the crease, and 
junior forward Cooper Marody 
rushed in to finish off the tap-in.

And then Michigan went cold.
Fifteen 
first 
period 
shots 

amounted to only one goal. The 
first 11 of the second begot even 
less. The Wolverines were given 
a break, however, when Spartan 
forward Mitchell Lewandowski 
shoved junior forward Brendan 

Warren into the boards, earning 
himself a disqualification and his 
team a five-minute major penalty.

Four 
minutes 
and 
50 

seconds later, Michigan still 
had nothing to show for it. But 
then, sophomore forward Adam 
Winborg 
gathered 
the 
puck 

behind the Michigan State net 
and set up for a wraparound 
attempt.

Lethemon stuffed his first 

shot. Ditto for the second. But 
the third time proved to be the 
charm, as freshman forward Jack 
Becker got to the rebound and 
put it past the Spartan goaltender 
for a 2-0 lead, giving Michigan 
crucial breathing room going into 
the final period.

It would need all of it. 

Michigan State forward Taro 
Hirose scored directly off a 
faceoff right after the third 
period began. After freshman 
defenseman 
Quinn 
Hughes 

slipped home a close-range finish 
off a pinpoint cross-ice pass from 
Cecconi with five minutes to play, 
the Spartans answered right back 
when Patrick Khodorenko snuck 

a pass under a Wolverine stick 
and to David Keefer, who halved 
the Michigan State deficit.

And in the end, it came down 

to an unlikely save from an 
unlikely source.

“I couldn’t watch the last two 

minutes,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “We have to get 
better. We have to learn how to 
play with a lead. When you’re 
(up) 2-0 — faceoff goal, bang, now 
you’ve got a game. We get 3-1, 
that should have been it. They 
should not get another Grade-A 
opportunity after that. And we’ve 
got to understand that we’ve got 
to learn to play in tight games 
with a lead when there’s a lot on 
the line.”

The 
Spartans 
outshot 

Michigan, 34-33, including a 12-5 
margin in the crucial third period. 
Skirmishes broke out frequently, 
and missed opportunities were 
routine. By any measure, this 
was not the Wolverines’ prettiest 
performance.

Perhaps 
Cecconi’s 
game-

saving play was most emblematic 
of that.

Anatomy of a no-hitter

In her collegiate debut Friday 

against 
Alabama-Birmingham, 

Meghan Beaubien plunked the 
first batter she faced.

It seemed at the time an 

ominous 
foreshadowing, 

but maybe it was more of an 
announcement, a way of saying, 
“I’m Meghan Beaubien. Don’t 
mess with me.”

Making the start in the next 

game, she didn’t allow a single hit.

“I think it’s really cool, and 

I think it’s really telling of her 
future at Michigan,” said junior 
second baseman Faith Canfield. 
“Just how successful she’s gonna 
be.”

Even when things didn’t go her 

way, Beaubien was unfazed. At 
times, she was even entertained. 
In the bottom of the second 
inning, 
Georgia 
State 
batter 

Arden Jobe fouled off pitch after 
pitch. Finally, Beaubien went to 
her changeup — a 55 mph offering 
that kept hitters off-balance all 
day — and Jobe swung straight 
through it.

“I actually have fun with 

those situations,” Beaubien said. 
“It’s always fun to have a battle 
like that between a pitcher and a 
hitter.”

But after that, the Panthers 

didn’t seem to have much fight 
left, as seven of the next eight 
batters struck out.

Meanwhile, Michigan, which 

had opened up a 2-0 lead in the 
first 
inning, 

tacked on RBI 
singles 
from 

junior 
catcher 

Katie Alexander 
and 
sophomore 

outfielder Thais 
Gonzalez in the 
fourth to make 
the score 5-0.

After 
that, 

Beaubien showed 
her first signs of 
being anything but in control, as 
two fly balls seemed destined for 
trouble before diving catches by 
Gonzalez and senior right fielder 
Aidan Falk kept the no-hitter 
alive.

“People made fantastic plays 

that game,” Beaubien said, “and 
that shows that that no-hitter is 
really a team effort.”

In the top of the sixth inning, 

junior second baseman Faith 
Canfield stepped up to the plate 
with two runners on. She worked 
the count to 3-2, waiting for her 
pitch.

When she got it, it left the 

ballpark to extend the lead to 8-0.

The Wolverines knew that 

if they didn’t allow a run in the 
bottom of the inning, the game 
would end due to the run rule.

Three more outs would seal it.
Three.
Strike three whizzed right by a 

flustered Georgia State batter.

Two.
A 
routine 
groundout 
to 

shortstop.

One.
Beaubien walked the next 

batter on four straight pitches. 
The crowd was restless. Was she 
feeling fatigued? Could she finish 
it off?

Then came a soft line drive 

off the bat of Panther designated 
player Megan Litumbe. Beaubien 
turned around, tracking it until 
it landed safely into the glove of 
sophomore shortstop Madison 
Uden.

Zero.
Her reaction was subdued 

— a simple fist pump as the 
Wolverines rushed the field. After 
all, her pitching spoke for itself.

As hard as it is to top a no-hitter, 

for Beaubien, this is just the 

beginning.

“I expect that 

she’ll have a lot 
of great things in 
her career,” said 
Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. 
“ … We’ll take 
the no-hitters in 
stride, and I think 
she handled it 
like a champ.”

And 
though 

Michigan may not have had 
quite the weekend it wanted 
— dropping both its games on 
Saturday — it knew one thing: 
Mess with Meghan Beaubien at 
your own risk.
