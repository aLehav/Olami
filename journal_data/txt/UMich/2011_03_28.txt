Indoor Track & Field Building
Saturday afternoon, more than
500 students rushed to the stage
and wildly threw their hands up
in the air amid a flurry of flashing
lights.
The scene marked the start of
the 14th annual Dance Marathon
at the University, which is one of
the largest student-run organi-
zations on campus. Beginning
Saturday morning and culminat-
ing Sunday evening, hundreds
of students danced for 30-hours
straight to increase awareness
and raise money for pediatric
rehabilitation programs at the
University's C.S. Mott Children's
and Women's Hospital and Beau-
mont Hospital in Royal Oak.

ST. LOUIS -
Fifteen years ago, Brendan
Morrison and a support-
ing cast legitimized the
Michigan hockey program once
again by winning the national
title that had eluded the Wolver-
ines for 32 years.
It defeated Colorado College
in dramatic overtime fashion
and became the champions in
1996, pushing earlier disappoint-
ments to the wayside.
Though a few years in the

making,
Michigan
had finally
done it.
"Michi-
gan was
really back
on the map MARK
in college BURNS
hockey," BURNS _
Morrison
said about the program earlier
this week in a phone interview.
"A lot of the years, we were

favored but just couldn't pull out
the big games.
"It was our time. We were
due to win. It was a big relief to
know, 'Hey, you know, we can
win the big game. We are one of
the top programs."'
Press the fast-forward button
to 2011, and these Wolverines
are headed to the Frozen Four
for the first time since 2008, fol-
lowing a 2-1 victory over Colo-
rado College on Saturday night.
But with the date in St. Paul,

Minnesota in two weekends,
Michigan has only one question
to answer: Could this be the
season it, once again, wins the
national title, putting it into the
conversation as being THE best
program in the country?
And, guess what?
Michigan is due for a national
title in the worst way, making
this the year an NCAA Cham-
pionship will finally be brought
home to Ann Arbor.

International air raids

Sirte, Tripoli
bombed as rebels
move toward
takeover of capital ,
RAS LANOUF, Libya (AP) -
International air raids targeted
Moammar Gadhafi's hometown
of Sirte for the first time last
night as rebels quickly closed in
on the regime stronghold, a for-
midable obstacle that must be
overcome for government oppo-
nents to reach the capital Tripoli.
A heavy bombardment of
Tripoli also began after nightfall,
with at least nine loud explosions
and anti-aircraft fire heard, an
Associated Press reporter in the
city said.
Earlier in the day, rebels
regained two key oil complexes

along the coastal highway that
runs from the opposition-held
eastern half of the country
toward Sirte and beyond that, to
the capital. Moving quickly west-
ward, the advance retraced their
steps in the first rebel march
toward the capital. But this
time, the world's most power-
ful air forces have eased the way
by pounding Gadhafi's military
assets for the past week.
Sirte is strategically located
about halfway between the
rebel-held east and the Gadhafi-
controlled west along the Medi-
terranean coast. It is a bastion of
support for Gadhafi that will be
difficult for the rebels to overrun
and the entrances to the city have
reportedly been mined. If the
rebels could somehow overcome
Sirte, momentum for a march on
the capital would skyrocket.i
An AP reporter at the front

said the latest rebel advance dur-
ing the day reached as far west as
the oil port of Ras Lanouf, about
130 miles (210 kilometers) east of
Sirte.
After nightfall, Libyan state
television confirmed air raids
on Sirte and Tripoli. Foreign
journalists who were taken by
the regime to Sirte a few hours
before the bombings began
reported hearing at least six
loud explosions and warplanes
flying overheard. They were
driven around the city and said
it was swarmingwith soldiers on
patrol and armed civilians, many
of them wearinggreen bandanas
that signaled their support for
Gadhafi.
In the contested city of Mis-
rata in western Libya, residents
reported fighting between rebels
and Gadhafi loyalists who fired
from tanks on residential areas.

Supreme Court to take on Wal-Mart
employment discrimination lawsuit

Class action could
involve up to 1.6
million women
WASHINGTON (AP) - Chris-
tine Kwapnoski hasn't done too
badly in nearly 25 years in the
Wal-Mart family, making more
than $60,000 a year in a job she
enjoys most days.
But Kwapnoski says she faced
obstacles at Wal-Mart-owned
Sam's Club stores in both Mis-
souri and California: Men mak-
ing more than women and getting
promoted faster.
She never heard a supervisor
tell a man, as she says one told her,
to "doll up" or "blow the cobwebs
off" her make-up.
Once she got over the fear that
she might be fired, she joined
what has turned into the largest

job discrimination lawsuit ever.
The 46-year-old single mother
of two is one of the named plain-
tiffs in a suit that will be argued
at the Supreme Court tomorrow.
At stake is whether the suit can
go forward as a class action that
could involve 500,000 to 1.6 mil-
lion women, according to varying
estimates, and potentially could
cost the world's largest retailer
billions of dollars.
But the case's potential impor-
tance goes well beyond the Wal-
Mart dispute, as evidenced by
more than two dozen briefs filed
by business interests on Wal-
Mart's side, and civil rights, con-
sumer and union groups on the
other.
The question is crucial to the
viability of discrimination claims,
which become powerful vehi-
cles to force change when they
are presented together, instead

of individually. Class actions
increase pressure on businesses to
settle suits because of the cost of
defending them and the potential
for very large judgments.
Columbia University law pro-
fessor John Coffee said that the
high court could bring a virtual
end to employment discrimina-
tion class actions filed under Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
depending on how it decides the
Wal-Mart case.
"Litigation brought by indi-
viduals under Title VII is just too
costly," Coffee said. "It's either
class action or nothing."
Illustrating the value of class
actions, Brad Seligman, the Cal-
ifornia-based lawyer who con-
ceived of and filed the suitl10 years
ago, said the average salary for a
woman at Wal-Mart was $13,000,
about $1,100 less than the average
for a man, when the case began.

Reports of security
forces shooting
demonstrators
across the country
LATAKIA, Syria - Gangs
of young men, some armed
with swords and hunting rifles,
roamed yesterday through the
streets of a Syrian seaside city,
closing alleys with barricades
and roughly questioning pass-
ersby in streets scarred by days of
anti-government unrest.
The scenes in Latakia, a Medi-
terranean port once known as
a summmer tourist draw, were
a remarkable display of anar-
chy in what had been one of the
Mideast's most tightly controlled
countries.
Syria has been rocked by
more than a week of demon-
strations that began in the
drought-parched southern
agricultural city of Daraa and
exploded nationwide on Friday,
with security forces opening fire
on demonstrators in at least six
places and killing dozens.
A Damascus-based activist
said residents of an impoverished
hillside neighborhood of the capi-
tal known as Mezah-86 reported
that government forces were

attacking demonstrators there
last night.
The activist said two residents
reported hearing gunfire in the
area as they spoke to him by
phone.
"I heard shouting, screaming,
fighting and shooting," he said.
One of the residents reported
seeing security forces breaking
into the home of at least one per-
son who had attended an anti-
government protest earlier in the
evening, the activist said.
His account could not be inde-
pendently confirmed because
Syria maintains tight restrictions
on journalists and many areas
have become unsafe in recent days.
The government has also tried
to calm the situation with con-
cessions, and President Bashar
Assad is expected to announce
Tuesday that he is lifting a nearly
50-year state of emergency and
moving to annul other harsh
restrictions on civil liberties and
political freedoms.
Member of Parliament
Mohammed Habash told The
Associated Press that lawmakers
discussed the state of emergency
during a night session yester-
day and Assad would make an
announcement about the issue on
Tuesday. He offered no further
details.
Ammar Qurabi, an exile in

Egypt who heads Syria's National
Organization for Human Rights,
said there appeared to be diver-
gent views within the Syrian
leadership, with one branch that
believes in a crackdown and
another that believes in dialogue.
He said Assad must address
the people and show some trans-
parency as quickly as possible.
"People are askingthemselves,
where is he? why doesn't he make
an appearance?" Qurabi said.
"Assad must choose whether
he wants to go the way of the
Moroccan king, who has pledged
to sponsor broad constitutional
reforms, or the Gadhafi way.
Which is it going to be?"
A top adviser to Assad offered
the first hint of reforms in an
announcement Thursday, say-
ing the government had begun
studying change to the emergen-
cy law and other measures. That
pledge did not stop protests from
erupting in cities across Syria the
following day.
Some of the worst violence
appears to have taken place in
Latakia, a coastal city that is a
mix of Sunnis living in its urban
core and members of Assad's
minority Alawite branch of Shiite
Islam in villages on its outskirts,
along with small minorities of
Christians, ethnic Turks and
other groups.

Body of newborn

Authorities have ordered an
autopsy on the body of a newborn
boy found in the attic of a home in
Huron County's Port Hope.
Sheriff's officials tell the Bay

Authorities say they began

Radiation found in

Health officials said yesterday
that one sample of Massachusetts
rainwater has registered very low

likely from the Japanese nuclear

nami.
John Auerbach, the Massa-
chusetts commissioner of public
health, said that radioiodine-131
found in the sample - one of more
than 100 that have been taken
around the country -is short
lived. He said the drinking water
supply in the state was unaffected
and officials do not expect any
health concerns.
Nevada and other Western
states also have reported minus-

scientists say those presented no
health risks.

Israel unveils new
anti-missile shield
Israel deployed a cutting-edge
rocket defense system yester-
day, rolling out the latest tool in
its arsenal to stop a recent spike
in attacks from the neighboring
Gaza Strip.
Israel hopes the homegrown
Iron Dome system will provide
increased security to its citizens,
but officials warned that it can't
do the job alone. The system
went into operation shortly after
an Israeli aircraft struck a group
of militants in Gaza, killing two.
Israeli said they were about to fire
a rocket.
The Iron Dome system has
raised hopes that Israel has final-
ly found a solution to the years of
rocket fire from Gaza. The primi-
tive rockets have evaded Israel's
high-tech weaponry, in part
because their short flight path,
just a few seconds, makes them
hard to track.

Japan earthquake
hurts auto industry
The auto industry disruptions
triggered by Japan's earthquake
and tsunami are about to get
worse.
In the weeks ahead, car buy-
ers will have difficulty finding the
model they want in certain colors,
thousands of auto plant workers
will likely be told to stay home,
and companies such as Toyota,
Honda and others will lose bil-
lions of dollars in revenue. More
than two weeks since the natural
disaster, inventories of crucial car
supplies - from computer chips to
paint pigments - are dwindling
fast as Japanese factories that
make them struggle to restart.
Because parts and supplies are
shipped by slow-moving boats,
the real drop-off has yet to be felt
by factories in the U.S., Europe
and Asia. That will come by the
middle of April.
"This is the biggest impact
ever in the history of the auto-
mobile industry," says Koji Endo,
managing director at Advanced

Bowl Team on animal rights

PETA VP: 99
percent of dining

mass farming
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
The fight for animal rights is
one that has long plagued college
campuses abound with animal
testing and meat-filled cafete-
rias.
The fight continued Friday
when roughly 75 people congre-
gated in the gallery of the Hatch-
er Graduate Library to watch
members of the Michigan Eth-
ics Bowl Team face off against
People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals Vice President Bruce
Friedrich in a debate regarding
the question, "Is eating meat
ethical?" The event was hosted
by peta2, the youth division of
the larger organization, as part
of a push to facilitate discussion
of animal rights on college cam-
puses.
Friedrich opened the debate
by arguing the immorality of
consuming meat. He also pro-
vided a PowerPoint presenta-
tion with pictures of a cat, pig,
chicken and dog. Friedrich asked
if anyone in the audience would
kill and eat the cat. A few people
raised their hands.
"Well, you can't," Friedrich
said. "She's my cat."

shocked that women now have
to fight to maintain rights they
won decades ago, such as access
to health care services and
equality in the workforce.
"We fought for equality, and
I think too many young women
take for granted what they
have," Dingell said. "I never
thought I would have to fight to
keep what we fought for."
At the rally, Dingell
expressed her disapproval with
the Republican Party's attempt
to cut Title X of the Public
Health Service Act created by
the federal government to fund
organizations like Planned
Parenthood that provide free
health care services to women.
The bill would eliminate about
$330 million offundingthrough

Dingell said it is an "indica-

licans have become" since they
are trying to cuta program that

Republican President Richard
Nixon.
Dingell ended her speech by
calling upon women of all ages
to fight for their rights and con-
tinue the struggle for women's
equality in our society.
"Now is the time to let your
voices be heard, to organize
women and young women
across the country," Dingell
said. "Do not become quiet and
complacent."

enthood supporters marched

If you would've told me that
I'd be seeing that back in Octo-
ber, I would have called you
nuts.
I grew accustomed to the
team's constant disappoint-
ments in NCAA Tournament
play. The poor goaltending, slop-
py defensive effort and inability
to score the big game-changing
goal all adds up to no NCAA
Championship banners being
raised in Yost Ice Arena.
And whatever the case may
be for any of the recent sub-par
performances in the tourna-
ment - giving up four straight
goals to Colorado College in
2005 or maybe the 2009 first-
round upset at the hands of Air
Force - the fact still remains
black and white.

Friedrich encouraged people
who are passionate about envi-
ronmental and animal rights to
practice a vegan lifestyle in order
to support the stance that eating
meat is unethical.
"If you can choose between
mercy and misery, you should
choose mercy," Friedrich said.
The six-person Ethics Bowl
Team rebutted with an argument
highlighting the meat industry's
attempt to enforce stricter regu-
lations for better treatment of
animals. While the team agreed
that the current meat industry
continues to employ unethical
practices, members argued-that
methods like free-range ani-
mal farming and default live-
stock systems could increase
the animals' quality of life while
decreasing carbon emissions.
In response, Friedrich said
that 99 percent of meat - includ-
ing what University students eat
in the dining halls - is obtained
from mass farming, a practice
known for its animal abuse. He
added that free-range animals
endure abuse, as illustrated by
graphic clips from the PETA doc-
umentary, "Meet Your Meat."
LSA senior Kevin Lane, an
Ethics Bowl team member,
argued that animals don't have
the same investment in their
lives as humans do.
"An animal's future life is not
valuable in the same way that a
human's future life is valuable,"
Lane said.

intersection of East Liberty and
South Division. As they walked
along State Street, dozens of
motorists honked their horns in
support of their cause.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after the rally,
Dingell said if the legislation
passed, it would be large step
backward for women's rights.
"(Planned Parenthood) is
the only way a lot of young
women can get health care,"
Dingell said. ".What scares me
is that it's not only about cut-
ting Planned Parenthood, it's
the fact that they want to take
funding away from Title X. This
is about women going back-
wards."
In an interview before the
event, Lori Lamerand, CEO
of Planned Parenthood Mid
and South Michigan, said even
with funding from Title X, the
organization still doesn't have
enough money to fund its ser-
vices, adding that the generos-
ity of private donors is critical
to the organization's function-
ality.
Lamerand added that with-
out Planned Parenthood,
low-income students and Ann
Arbor residents would have
no alternative to affordable
health care and family plan-
ning options.
"On campus there is the
University Health Service, but
that is not necessarily on a slid-
ing fee scale," Lamerand said.
"All of (Planned Parenthood's)
services accommodate women
even if they don't have other
resources, and that is not true
in any place else."
LSA sophomore Christen

It's time.
Just like it was time in Cin-
cinnati, Ohio back in the mid-
1990s.
This year. Right now.
The current group of Wol-
verines has it in them to earn
the title of being called No.1.
Michigan will walk out of the
Xcel Energy Center with the
national title.
The Wolverines have won
games every way imaginable in
2010-11.
The crazy bounces that just
cannot seem to be explained
(Chad Langlais, I'm looking at
you).
The scoring touch from
Scooter Vaughan and Lee Moffie
that just flat out wasn't expected
this year - the duo has account-
ed for 21 goals this season.
The eight come-from-behind
victories and the refuse-to-quit
mentality that this team exhib-

Khersan, an Ethics Bowl Team
member, said people should cut
back on how much meat they con-
sume but emphasized that eating
meat is not immoral and actually
has various health benefits.
Following the debate, LSA
senior Marissa Kresch, who
attended the event, said she was
disappointed with the quality
of the Ethics Bowl Team's argu-
ment. She said some of their
points were inaccurate - partic-
ularly their points regarding the
environmental hazard posed by
large herds of livestock.
When LSA junior and Eth-
ics Bowl Team member Elton
Li asked during the debate what
could be done about the green-
house gases emitted by livestock,
Kresch shouted, "Stop raising
animals for food."
LSA freshman Rene Hanna
said he thought the debate was
stimulating, and as a result he
didn't feel the need to proclaim a
victor because "the winner is the
listener."
Friedrich recently spoke in
similar debates on many cam-
puses around the country includ-
ing Yale University and Harvard
College. In an interview after
the debate, he said university
students are the "most primed"
for thinking about ethics, includ-
ing those involved with animal
rights.
"More and more college stu-
dents are choosing to align their
ethics with their action," Fried-
rich said.
Houck - who was holding a
sign at the rally that read, "If it's
your choice, your body, use your
own money" - said she thinks
Planned Parenthood's primary
goal is to profit off abortions
and not to educate or provide
health care to women.
"Planned Parenthood is an
abortion mill," Houck said.
Lamerand said that abor-
tions account for only a small
percentage of Planned Parent-
hood's services, with 97 percent
of its efforts focused on preven-
tative medicine, birth control,
breast screenings and gyneco-
logical care.
Houck added that women
would not lose access to free
health care and family planning
services if Planned Parenthood
disappeared, arguing that crisis
pregnancy centers like Arbor
Vitae, located on East Liberty
Street, have been providing free
health care and family planning
services to women for years
without funding from the fed-
eral government.
LSA senior Cynthia Yoon has
been to Planned Parenthood
numerous times during the
course of her college career to
receive affordable health care,
birth control, and even an abor-
tion. Without Planned Parent-
hood, she said, she would lose
her primary source of health
care.
"(Planned Parenthood) is
a great investment that this
country is making because oth-
erwise I would be asking the
government for even bigger
support if it wasn't for Planned
Parenthood's services," Yoon
said.

ited all year, with Friday night
against Nebraska-Omaha being
no different.
And finally, a little luck in
late February against Western
Michigan to cap off a dramatic
two-goal comeback on senior
night.
Brendan Morrison knew his
team was certainly due for a
title.
And maybe, just maybe, the
same could possibly be said for
current senior forward Louie
Caporusso.
"When you win when you're
not supposed to win, I think it's
a sign," Caporusso said follow-
ing the overtime win against
Western Michigan. "It's a sign
that maybe this is the year for
Michigan hockey."
Believe me Louie, it is.

mittee - an advisory body which
hears grievances filed against
DPS - technically qualifying
him for the second student-held
spot on the six-person commit-
tee. LSA junior Ellen Steele, who
ran uncontested, will hold the
first student seat.
LSA junior Breah Patterson,
elections director for MSA, said
since Marks is not an enrolled
student, he is ineligible for a
spot on the DPS Oversight Com-
mittee.
The second student currently
on the committee will be gradu-
ating this spring. To fill the posi-
tion, MSA planned to choose
a write-in candidate with the
most amount of votes, since the
election was uncontested.
It is likely, Patterson said,
that the position will be fulfilled
by LSA junior Michael Pry, a
write-in candidate who earned
12 votes, which was the fourth-
highest number of votes in the
category.
The most recent version of
the MSA constitution states,"No
representative may run for elec-
tion or hold office representing
a constituency of which that
person is not a member." Addi-
tionally, students cannot run for
positions under aliases, though
Marks does not appear to be an
alias, Patterson said.
However, DPS Oversight
Committee procedure docu-
ments do not explicitly outlaw
certain students, fictional or
real, from holding positions.
The Every Three Weekly, a
satire publication on campus,
began endorsing Marks as a
write-in candidate for MSA pres-
ident this month in an effort to
demonstrate its dissatisfaction
with MSA and its governing.
Campbell said he was not sur-
prised by the attention Marks
received and feels that the fic-
tional character's popularity
was due to student frustration
with MSA.
"I expected that write-in can-
didates receive quite a few votes
because students are rightfully
frustrated with an assemblythat
is not as active as it could be and
is not as aggressive in publiciz-
ing its own successes," he said.
Campbell said that when he
takes office he hopes to make
the government more reflective
of student needs.
"I'm really looking forward
to taking my experience and my
knowledge and applying those
principles to the assembly in
hopes of making the Michigan
Student Assembly a better advo-
cate and a more aggressive force
for change on campus," Camp-
bell said.
Despite frustration from stu-
dents, Campbell added that he
believes MSA has made progress
this year.
"I think too few students rec-
ognize the great things MSA has

Monday, March 28, 2011 - 3A
done over the past year, from
dramatically changing the hous-
ing polity for transgendered
students to giving service orga-
nizations access to free vehicles
for service projects," Campbell
said.
Patterson also expressed her
and fellow MSA members' dis-
appointment about the lack of
seriousness toward the elec-
tions.
"You do have to expect it,
that someone is going to write-
in something kind-of crazy,"
she said. "I think that (Marks)
has definitely been a thorn in
our side, especially since he
earned more votes than we were
expecting."
Patterson added that it's not
unusual for voters to write-in
offbeat nominees. This year,
write-ins for various positions
included Central Campus squir-
rel, Harry Potter and George
Clooney.
While Marks's votes were
strong across categories, the
number of total voters decreased
from 14 percent of the student
body in fall 2010 elections to 11
percent this spring.
Briana Hatcher, candidate for
the Defend Affirmative Action
Party, said she was frustrated by
the lack of student concern for
MSA elections. Despite her dis-
content with the election results,
she said she plans to run for an
MSA position again next year.
"I was a little disappointed
that there was only a 11 per-
cent turnout," Hatcher said. "I
wish there were more students
who cared about how elections
turned out."
In an effort to increase vot-
ing, voting stations were placed
at locations such as the Michi-
gan Union, Michigan League
and Pierpont Commons for the
first time in a decade. Students
also had the opportunity to vote
online.
In an interview with last
week, MSA president-elect
DeAndree Watson said he was
happy with this year's voter
turnout.
"I'm at least excited that over
10 percent of the student body
decided to vote in this election,
especially considering that it
wasn't the most contested," he
said.
Campbell echoed Watson's
sentiments, but said there is
more progress to be made in
terms of voter turnout.
"I don't think you can be sat-
isfied until all of campus votes in
student government elections,"
he said.
Patterson said that though she
hoped more students would have
voted, she was pleased by aturn-
out that was higher than origi-
nally expected by MSA officials.
"We think that students
should want to have an active
role in selecting and participat-
ing in government," she said.
"We can only hope for the best
and hope that that message
comes across to everyone."

A justified intervention
The U.N. was correct to take action in Libya
For the third time since 2001, the United States is using
military force against a country in the Middle East. But unlike
our decision to invade Iraq, which was condemned by the
international community, the Libyan intervention has the support
of the United Nations and is being led by a coalition of nations,
not all of whom are traditional allies of the U.S. Most importantly,
this operation is a limited one. Though there's a lot of uncertainty
moving forward, there's already been a victory for freedom and the
international community.

On March 17, the United Nations Security
Council authorized member states to "take all
necessary measures" to protect Libyan civil-
ians under attack by forces loyal to Libya's
leader, Muammar al-Gaddafi. Libya has been
rocked by conflict since February, when Gad-
dafi ordered his military to attack pro-democ-
racy demonstrators, killing hundreds and
sparking armed revolts across the country. On
March 19, a multinational coalition began air-
strikes against targets in Libya. This was the
first step in enforcing a no-fly zone intended
to protect Libyan civilians from the dictator,
whose son has threatened "rivers of blood"
if the rebellion isn't quelled. France, Britain,
Italy, Canada, Denmark, Qatar and the United
Arab Emirates have all contributed to the mil-
itary response currently being led by the U.S.
Intervention in Libya was the right choice.
Gaddafi is a violent dictator who has used
his military - largely composed of foreign
mercenaries - to kill hundreds of civilians.
As pro-democracy protests have swept the
Middle East, only Gaddafi has responded with
extreme violence. The choice of the United
Nations to allow intervention will save thou-
sands of lives and give international support
for the right of people everywhere to choose
their own government. Too often, the inter-

national community stands idly by while dic-
tators like Gaddafi massacre the people they
rule. The international response in Libya sets
a precedent of not tolerating extreme violence
against civilians.
The military action in Libya is a victory for
international law. France, Britain and the U.S.
admirably resisted calls to act unilaterally by
waiting for U.N. approval before beginning
strikes. The events of the past month prove
that the international community is able and
willing to protect civilians. After Libya, it will
be harder for those who doubt international
resolve to demand that the U.S., or any other
country, act alone. This military operation
proves wrong those who believe that com-
bined international solutions never work.
War is unpredictable. The crash of a U.S.
fighter jet in Libya last week underscores just
how easily the situation could change. Presi-
dent Barack Obama has repeatedly stated that
the U.S. will not conduct a land invasion of
Libya. Hopefully the president is committed
to that policy, but unforeseen circumstances
might lead him to widen the war, a choice
that could prove costly for the country. The
intervention in Libya is justified as long as it
is limited in scope and has the support of the
international community.

The words I write here are
free. Whether you picked
up The Michigan Daily
somewhere on
campus or you
clicked to my
column on the ;
Daily website,
you get a taste
of my immense
wisdom for free.
And I consider
myself a talent- IMRAN
ed writer and SYED
thinker. Lucky
you.
I have a friend. She works for The
New York Times, and as of today,
her words are no longer free. She's
smart, talented and a very good
journalist, but to echo the words
of all those people who are decry-
ing the imposition of the Times's
paywall, I ask one simple question:
Why would you pay for her words
when you can have mine for free?
The answer is simple, of course,
but allow me to illustrate. I begin by
quoting almost verbatim an online
conversation I had with this friend
of mine last week:
Friend: So The Times paywall
goes up soon.
me: really? too bad
Friend: No, this is good for those
of us who make money over here in
the newspaper business...
me: whatever
Friend: It's really not a bad deal.
me: I'm sure huffpo will summa-
rize it all for me
Friend: You get the first 20 arti-
cles a month free, and then you can
pay for a pretty cheap subscription.
Also, if you enter the site through
a link elsewhere, you won't be
bumped, even if you meet the 20
story minimum.

me: Daily Beast is still free? then
i'm set
Friend: You're the worst journal-
ist ever.
me: um, duh. so i gotta pay to see
the caucus blog too?
Friend: Yes, I believe so.
me: psh, screw that. you should
transfer. maybe drudge report?
Friend: I'm not dignifying this
with a response.
me: be cool now. just because
your profession is dying doesn't
mean you can be angry with me
Friend: My profession isn't dying.
me: DEAD
Facetiousness aside, my friend
is right, of course. The New York
Times should get money for the
reporting its journalists do. Good
reporting entails many costs of pro-
duction. And while I like to think
I occasionally have great insights
on national and international
issues, I'm among the large group
of secondary producers of journal-
ism - those who borrow the facts
uncovered by national news orga-
nizations like the Times and use
that as the basis of their own writ-
ing and contributions. (I don't mean
to disparage the work of the Daily's
own reporters, who do an excel-
lent job of gathering their own facts
about local issues. I speak here only
of myself.)
I borrowed my friend's words to
literally fill my column this time to
prove a point: We borrow wisdom
from the real journalists all the
time. Whether its amateur colum-
nists like me or the professional
copy-and-pasters at news aggrega-
tion sites like The Drudge Report or
The Huffington Post, we depend on
others to do the digging for us and
then neatly package and present it
to our own readers for free.

For all the talk of the death of
newspapers in the digital age, it's
importantto never forgetone thing:
Secondary producers of news -
those blogs and quick-hit news sites
we all browse - are not self-sus-
taining. If real news organizations
like the Times disappeared, The
Drudge Report would have nothing
to report. And I could sit here and
guess how that whole Japan thing
is going down, but without the
reports of the journalists actually
on the ground, I wouldn't have any
actual facts to work with.
Good reporting
entails many
production costs.
So let's all pipe down about the
Times's paywall, OK? Like books,
CDs, movies, etc., real journalism
is a created product that involves
costs of labor, time and insight. The
Times isn't the first organization to
institute a paywall, and it certainly
won't be the last. Soon, once other
major publications are no longer
free, readers will have a simple
choice: Either pay the nominal sub-
scription fee to get real news, or
be content with borrowed wisdom
from the likes of me.
.And I recommend that you pay
the fee and stick with the profes-
sionals because, with that paywall
up, who knows where the hell I'll be
getting my facts.

'Grading Gap' article read
more like a tabloid than news
TO THE DAILY:
I must say that I enjoy following The Michi-
gan Daily from afar. While Iwas an undergrad
at the University studying in South America
and North Africa, and while currently liv-
ing and working in the Middle East, I fondly
look toward the Daily as a window into my
salad days in Ann Arbor. However, I was quite
frustrated and worried by your article (The
Grading Gap:Analyzing the disparities in grade
distributions, 3/22/2011).
I understand the need for catchy titles and
subjects that capture the attention of the stu-
dent body. However, it's important that the
Daily doesn't lead the reader or act as a tabloid.
It's clear that in "The Grading Gap" the inten-
tion was one of "Hey reader, come see the hard
hitting truth about grades at Michigan!" The
article claimed to show which majors were
"easiest" and "hardest." However, from the
outset, this was flawed. The article and graph-
ics (which I believe were added later on the
website after publishing) claim that the crite-
ria for "hard and easy" was based on average
GPA of a major. This is inherently incorrect,
and the article itself acknowledges this when
the writer states "But grades aren't always an
indicator of the ease or difficulty of a class."
The article continuously stumbles over itself,
caught between the tabloid-esque vision of
outing the "easiest" courses and acknowl-
edging the truth: The difficulty of a course or
major is not solely linked to the average GPA of
it's students, and there are much greater vari-
ables at play.

This article had great potential. It is a fan-
tastic idea to explore which classes and majors
are the easiest. This would have made for a
great piece of research and journalism. Yet,
this would have taken work. The writer, or
team of journalists, would have had to delve
deeper into investigating course loads, time
spent on course work on average, relevance
of a class to the participant's major, average
grades for similar majors at various universi-
ties, etc. Additionally, I believe it would have
been of interest to many students to discuss
the "difficulty," even if solely based on aver-
age GPAs, of popular majors such as political
science, English, anthropology, history and
a wide array of LSA departments. While this
would have been the proper way to go about
creating a well crafted and thoughtful article,
the type that the Daily and it's numerous Pulit-
zer Prize-winning alumni are known for, it
appears that the paper took the "easy" way out.
I am no writer. In fact my grasp of the
English language is loosening every day. I
never worked on the Daily staff, and I gradu-
ated with a GPA that, accordingto this article,
would either make my major extremely hard
or make me somewhat of an underachiever (I
don't know which is true). However, I do have
great pride and respect for an institution such
as the Daily, and I view it as an important and
tangible symbol of the University at large.
For these reasons, I hope that the editors and
journalists who allowed this piece to go to
publishing will take more care to represent
themselves, the University, the students and
the Daily in a way that fits with it's great his-
tory and future.

University alum

On Feb. 26, state Rep. Dave Agema (R-Grandville)
introduced a bill that will undermine future prospects
for Michigan's next generation. Nearly identical to
Arizona's notorious immigration law, House Bill 4305
threatens to undercut Michigan's economic recovery by
imposing enforcement requirements that will bog down
our courts and law enforcement in frivolous lawsuits,
harm businesses by deterring legal immigration and do
little to combat illegal immigration, much less address
the state's more pressing issues. Michigan youth deserve
a better future than the one created by this unnecessary
and potentially unconstitutional bill.
Like Arizona's bill, HB 4305 obligates law enforce-
ment to verify the legal status of anyone who "should
reasonably be suspected of being unlawfully present
in the United States." Officers can also arrest "with or
without a warrant" anyone they think has committed
a crime that could result in their deportation. Finally,
the bill would allow residents to file lawsuits against
enforcement agencies for not implementing the law "to
the full extent permitted."
This will have critically negative implications for
Michigan's economy and its level of public safety. When
Arizona passed its immigration bill, it directly cost them
more than $250 million in boycotts and lost tax income
from immigrants who left after the bill's adoption, not to
mention the millions it is expected to waste on frivolous
lawsuits. In Arizona, the bill has cemented a reputation.
for reactionary politics .that hurt the state's economy
and significantly lowered consumption by driving away
immigrants who seek a more welcoming state.
Michigan is already struggling economically, and
given its dependence on immigrant businesses, it is
as susceptible to economic problems created by anti-
immigrant legislation as Arizona. Even Gov. Rick Sny-
der rightly said in his State of the State address that
attracting immigrants is crucial to Michigan's econom-
ic recovery: "Immigration made us a great state and
country," he stated. Passing this bill would be a huge
deterrent to future legal immigration and would ulti-
mately hurt business in Michigan. The state is already
faced with the problem of a "brain drain" and an aging
labor force. This bill would likely exacerbate these
problems by associating Michigan with regressive poli-
cies that college-educated youth do not support and by
driving away immigrant businesses that could create
key jobs.
Studies also demonstrate that similar city bills have
decreased public safety and put additional strain on
police forces. Burdening already over-extended state
police with the additional task of enforcing federal
immigration law only prevents them from performing

what is part of their job description: keeping communi-
ties safe. Giving individuals the right to sue police for
insufficiently enforcing immigration law leaves police
departments in a double-bind: If they enforce the law
they will likely be sued for profiling, but not enforcing
the law also leaves them vulnerable to lawsuits. This is
why police across the country have opposed the unfair
burden that bills like this place on law enforcement.
Austin, Texas Police Chief Art Acevedo commented that
similar immigration bill SB 1070 "will reverse the gains
made through long-term efforts to create an environ-
ment of trust between the migrant community and law
enforcement... (it) will undoubtedly further exacerbate
an atmosphere of fear and mistrust."
Even worse, this legislation will not effectively
address the issue of undocumented immigration at the
expense of hard-working Michigan citizens, immi-
grants and youth. To begin with, there are far fewer
undocumented immigrants here than in Arizona.
According to Federation for American Immigration
Reform data from 2008, about 7.5 percent of Arizona's
population is undocumented, while Michigan's is 2 per-
cent. Additionally, policy studies have demonstrated
that the "enforcement by attrition" approach to immi-
gration has negligible, if any, affect on undocumented
immigration rates. Thus, this bill threatens to waste
millions of dollars on increased lawsuits, create more
stress for law enforcement agencies, generate losses in
tax revenue from businesses and individuals who leave
and endanger the civil rights of American citizens and
documented immigrants without solving the issue it
claims to address. That means there is no justification
for the families torn apart every day by deportations, the
fear in immigrant communities from increased polic-
ing, the citizens denied jobs or the youth who inherit the
terrible consequences of this bill. This is unjust and an
ill-thought policy, plain and simple.
Michigan has many difficult problems to deal with,
not the least of which include its economic recession
and declining labor force. We deserve serious answers
to these problems. When this governor and legislators
came into office, they promised to deliver solutions. This
bill isn't a serious answer. It scapegoats immigrants and
exacerbates our state's real problems by hurting busi-
ness, increasing the "brain drain" and distracting law
enforcement officials from their job. We deserve state
politicians who work for a better future, not ones who
undermine it with unwise and unfair legislation like
House Bill 4305.

Lamenting the loss of Liz
Elizabeth Taylor made the most of
her fame on and off the screen
By Ben Verdi I Daily Arts Writer

Liz Taylor's passing from con-
gestive heart failure last Wednes-
day, at the age of 79, is a sad loss
for the entertainment world, and
the world in general, as we've not
only lost an icon, but a good soul.
While she may not have starred
in the films on our generation's
list of favorites, losing her is akin
to losing Michael Jackson, her
good friend, from the perspec-
tive of the cultural influences and
legacies they both left behind.
Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor
meant so much to the world of
American film and entertain-
ment, gracing the screen in films
like "Cleopatra," "Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?" and "Cat on a
Hot Tin Roof," that it's not quite
possible to quantify her effect on
the American art of show busi-
ness. At age 12 she was headlin-
ing films like MGM's "National
Velvet" and carving out a place
in '40s and '50s cinema as a child
star. Unlike most child stars,
however, she transitioned seam-
lessly from the teen icon she was
into the world-renowned cultur-
al force she was to become.
Despite standing 5'2", she
commanded the focus of people
in every room she walked into.
She was the woman you'd teach
your child to point at and say
"movie star." She had the kind

of beautiful face that could go in
the dictionary next to the words
"innocence" or "grace," and no
one would disagree. She was the
kind of celebrity that other celeb-
rities had a crush on, the kind to
dominate headlines - with eight
marriages to seven different men
- as much as the box office. She
won two Academy Awards and
was the first actress to earn $1
million for a film role. She han-
dled every high and low of her
life with enough aplomb to keep
people smiling and hopeful.
Liz Taylor had a famous heart
too. Despite her success, she
remained the same witty, intelli-
gent and caring woman her whole
life. She helped raise more than
$100 million for AIDS research
and was a voice for the causes of
civil and gay rights before either
cause was "cool" or profitable.
It's as difficult to sum up what
she meant to the world as a phi-
lanthropist and caring soul as it
is to describe how powerful and
famous she really was.
While Taylor had issues and
weathered the storms of celeb-
rity, she did so with a sense
of humor, and an uncommon
amount of appreciation for her
own fame, knowing that she had
a responsibility and an example
to set as someone in the public

AP

eye. She never thought she was
more famous than she actu-
ally was. She was never afraid
to make fun of herself. She
knew what she bargained for,
in becoming famous worldwide
because fame itself was never
her goal. For her, fame almost
came by accident, a residual
affect of her undeniable talent
and effortless beauty. What she
did with that fame, however, was
always something she consid-
ered more important than sim-
ply acquiring more of it.
Taylor always knew where
the camera was, an unteachable

characteristic of true celebrities
that does not arise out of vanity
like most people think, but out of
a genuine awareness of one's self
- one's true, silent confidence -
and a respect for the humbling
responsibility of fame. Beauty
fades, and dollars and tabloids
last only as long as it takes to
print new ones. But her legacy
of grace, combined with humil-
ity under the American spotlight,
still remain after her death as
reminders that even though a lot
of people have become famous
in America, few will ever be as
deserving of fame as Liz.

Snyder packs a visual 'Punch'

By WILL DEFEBAUGH
Daily Arts Writer
Reality is a prison. Freedom
is in the mind. These are the
mantras of director Zack Sny-
der's ("Watch-
men") new *
film, "Sucker
Punch." Sucker Punch
The film
follows the At Quality 16
mind-bending and Rave
story of Baby
Doll (Emily Wamer Bros.
Browning, "A
Series of Unfortunate Events"), a
20-year-old girl who is sent to an
insane asylum after she acciden-
tally shoots her sister in an effort
to protect them both from their
evil stepfather. Upon arriving,
her stepfather makes a deal with
the twisted owner of the asylum
to ensure that Baby Doll will be
lobotomized in five days.
To cope with the harsh new
reality in which she finds her-
self, Baby Doll re-imagines her
prison as a burlesque house. The
owner of the asylum becomes her
pimp, the doctor becomes her
dance instructor and the other
inmates, Blondie (Vanessa Hud-
gens, "Beastly"), Amber (Jamie
Chung, "Grown Ups") and sisters
Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish, "Lim-
itless") and Rocket (Jena Malone,
"Into the Wild"), become her fel-
low dancers and friends. Unfor-
tunately, this fantasy is not much
better than reality - they're still
prisoners, only now they're strip-
pers too.
This might leave some view-
ers to wonder why Baby Doll may
not have chosen a more pleasant
reality, but those people prob-
ably aren't familiar with Snyder's

work. He has a penchant for the
macabre and it's this aesthetic
that ultimately makes the film.
So, when Baby Doll is first asked
to dance, she escapes to an alter-
nate reality within her alternate
reality, where an old man tells her
she needs five items in order to
escape: a map, fire, a knife, a key
and a mysterious fifth item that
only she will be able to get. On the
quest to get each of these objects,
Baby Doll and company are trans-
ported to other worlds filled with
apparent robot Nazis and fire-
breathing dragons, where they
have machine guns, samurai
swords and even racier outfits.
The blueprints to the asylum-
brothel become a treasure map,
the kitchen knife becomes a
bomb on a high-speed train that
they must dismantle.
Robot Nazis,
strippers and
dragons, oh my.
These alternate worlds are
visually stunning. The incorpo-
ration of Bjork and music from
the film's own Emily Brown-
ing (try her cover of "Sweet
Dreams" and her duet with
Yoav, "Where Is My Mind?")
work well. The aesthetic is clas-
sic Snyder, looking half like a
movie and half like an extreme-
ly well-developed video game -
and wholly over-the-top.
While some might see this
over-the-top quality as a prob-
lem, it works for most aspects

of the movie. The only place it
doesn't is for the ridiculously
revealing "costumes" the girls
wear. Despite the film's claims
to be feminist, it still feels like a
bunch of half-naked girls with
machine guns running around in
fishnets and heels - or, in other
words, every man's "fantasy."
Apart from that, the film's
main problem may actually be
that it isn't over-the-top enough.
Many films adapt an in-your-face-
ridiculous quality and it works for

them. The problem is, it needs to
carry over into the writing as well
- it can't just be in the direction
and cinematography. And despite
the film's name, its plot is actu-
ally quite straightforward and
predictable, establishing a pattern
for itself within the first 30 min-
utes (find object, fight bad guys,
repeat). All in all, "Sucker Punch"
doesn't just look like avideo game,
it functions like one too - enjoy-
able and visually entertaining, but
without much depth.

catalyst for theater is not a com-

mon feat, but well-known play-
wright August Wilson managed it
too, finding his influence for "The
Piano Lesson" from Rosmare
Bearden's synthetic cubist paint-
ing, "Piano Lesson." Performance
Network Theatre is now bringing
the collage alive each night with
its revival of "The Piano Lesson."
"The Piano Lesson" is set in
Pittsburgh, during the Great
Depression, as the Sutter family's
current generation is debating
what it should do with a family
heirloom, a piano. The piano is a
very nostalgic object, consisting
of carved faces from people in
the family's lineage. During the
course of the play, a brother and

sister debate and argue with one
another about what they believe
should be done with the musi-
cal instrument and family token.
While Boy Willie, the brother,
wants to sell the piano in order to
buy the land his ancestors worked
on as a slave, his sister Bernice
insists on keeping it.
"The Piano Lesson" is under-
stood to be a part of Wilson's
"Pittsburgh Cycle", which con-
sists of 10 plays that illustrate
African Americans during the
20th century. A few years ago,
PNT presented a production of
"Fences," which is also a part of
the cycle. "Fences" director Tim

what we are doing to. If we are
just doing brand-new stuff, then it
makes it difficult for our audiences
to gauge if we are doing it well."
Though PNT is not presenting
any radical or unusual twist to this
play, the company is being innova-

that is somewhat more traditional
than their normal lineup.
"It is not necessarily a newspin

Perils o .A.M.E.

Yawning with 'Stars'

Chris Brown's
latest is catchy but
too self-pitying
By CHLOE STACHOWIAK
Daily Arts Writer
Chris Brown had a rough two
years in the media. After assault-
ing then-girlfriend Rihanna in
2009, his usual
life of "running
it" has been
turned upside- Chris Brown
down - instead
of the usual F.A.M.E.
radio releases
and European lve
tours he was
once accustomed to, the artist
has been busy with court dates
and community service. It's a
scandal that has shaken Brown's
fanbase worldwide, even lead-
ing to the cancellation of his UK
tour. Being a woman-beater and
a smooth-talking R&B artist just
isn't easy - felony charges have
a way of overshadowing even the
most heartfelt love songs.
By releasing his album
F.A.M.E., Chris Brown hopes
to right his wrongs and reclaim
his career from the hands of the
tabloids. His second release since
the 2009 incident, the album
plays on slow tempos and feel-
ings of vulnerability to rebuild
his romantic image. It's a desper-
ate cry to be restored to his for-
mer self - a sensitive ladies' man
instead of a brute with battered
r knuckles and a criminal record.
Brown's road to redemp-
tion begins with "Deuces." It's
a smooth, seductive song pep-
pered with rapping and per-
cussion, snappy and rhythmic
without being too aggressive.
However, the track's true colors
shine through its horrendously
crafted lyrics: Chris Brown and
the rappers Tyga and Kevin

COURTESY OFSONY
The face that breaks mirrors.

McCall join forces to deliver
some of the most generic lines to
enter the FM radio waves. The
three whine together about the
horrors of relationships and fall-
ing in love as they describe past
Valentine's Days and all times
they texted their ladies without
receiving replies.
The sob-fest reaches is its
peak when the words "fuck love"
are declared - it's a dramatic,
unoriginal statement that would
feel right at home in a preteen's
AIM profile. Despite their idi-
ocy, the lyrics still accomplish
one of the album's goals: They
portray Chris Brown as being
the helpless victim of relation-
ships - a far cry from the violent
felon he's been known as more
recently.
F.A.M.E.'s other tracks fol-
low in the footstep of "Deuces,"
as they spin their not-so-subtle
messages. With lyrics like "I'm
not gonna be the one to mess
this up" and "I never wanted
us to break up," Brown's goal to
sound defenseless is obvious. No
matter what the specific premise
of each song is or which DJs and
featured rappers help lay down
his tracks, he is always the vic-
tim of heartache.

Even ' with such tiresome
themes, the quality ofthe album's
music is undeniable. With their
intricate drum patterns and
rhythmic rapping, some of the
tracks are downright catchy -
especially the album's finale,
"Beautiful People." The song,
which features techno superstar
Benny Benassi, makes up for its
overly conventional lyrics with
tantalizing beats and synthesiz-
er. The house-style instrumen-
tals are blissful, hypnotizing and
more powerful than the vocals
themselves, drowning out every
predictable "just live your life"
and "your beauty's deep inside."
The fragile-hearted senti-
ments in F.A.M.E. may lose their
sparkle after a few songs, but
there's still something to be said
about the album's persistence. By
pushing these emotions to their
limits, Chris Brown has proven
more than just his vulnerability
- he's shown his dedication to
his career as well. Only time can
tell whether or not the album is
enough to reshape his image, but
the artist has at least one thing on
his side: If he was able to bounce
back after his laughable guest
performance on "The O.C." in
2007, anything is possible.

Nearly 21 million viewers
watched the premiere of the
12th season of "Dancing with
the Stars" last
Monday night.
Apparently,
it's a popular Dancing with
show. Yet it's the Stars

Maybe it's this season's
assembled group of celebrities.
From football star Hines Ward
to actress Kirstie Alley, "DWTS"
has gone out of its way this sea-
son to deliver a lively cast of
"almost" celebrities. The biggest
name for season 12 is apparently
Ralph Macchio, best known for
his starring role in "The Karate
Kid" over two decades ago.
It's likely you haven't even
heard of some of these sup-
posed "celebrities," namely radio
personality Mike Catherwood
("Loveline") and Disney channel
star Chelsea Kane ("JONAS").
The rest of the cast consists of
former Playboy bunny and real-
ity star Kendra Wilkinson, box-
ing legend Sugar Ray Leonard,
talk show host Wendy Williams,
supermodel Petra Nemcova, hip-
hop artist Romeo and wrestler
Chris Jericho.
One thing all these stars have
in common is that they're taking
the show way too seriously. There
are a lot of tears and emotional
displays packed into roughly 90
minutes. All 11 celebrities seem
to have gone on "DWTS" because
they have something to prove,
other than the fact that they
couldn't find work elsewhere.

dent groups such as the Michigan
Marching Band and Ann Arbor
band, Ella Riot.
LSA senior Eric Elgin, execu-
tive director of Dance Marathon,
said the program helps establish
meaningful relationships between
members of the University and the
greater community.
"It's an opportunity to get to
know a lot of people and at the
same time be paired with a family
you didn't know before and learn-
ing about a specific child and their
condition," Elgin said.
For the Lickman family, whose
5-year-old daughter Emily has
been diagnosed with cerebral
palsy, Dance Marathon has played
an important role in assisting her
physical therapy and rehabilita-
tion.
Emily's father, Phil Lickman,
said a Dance Marathon team visits
and works with Emily at therapy
every week. In November, Emily
underwent a selective dorsal
rhizotomy - a neurological pro-
cedure - at the Children's and
Women's Hospital and wasn't able
to attend a Dance Marathon bond-
ing event, but he said that didn't
stop University students from
bringing the event to her instead.
"Her team came and visited her
in the hospital - she missed the
pajama party - (but) had it with
her in her hospital bed," Lickman
said.
Lickman said he is in awe of
the encouragement and support
his family has received from the
Dance Marathon program.
"Her team has just been amaz-
ingly supportive of her, and it's
been a great experience for every-
body and the entire family," he
said.
Lickman said in order to keep
their Dance Marathon team going
into the wee hours of the night,
the family brings them a midnight
treat - a tradition they started last
year and hope to maintain.

Engineering Prof. John Lee speaks on the panel at a town hall meeting on nuclear energy in the MLB on March 26.

JAPAN
From Page1A
National Laboratory, participat-
ed in the symposium that was
moderated by James Holloway,
College of Engineering associate
dean for undergraduate educa-
tion.
The audience, which was
mostly comprised of University
students, listened as the profes-
sors discussed the comparisons
between the accident at the
Japanese power plant Fukushi-
ma Dai-ichi and a similar 1979
incident at Three Mile Island,
where a nuclear power plant in
Dauphin County, Penn. partially
melted down.
Kearfott - an expert on safe-
ty precautions in nuclear energy
and nuclear power plants - told
the audience that the crises at
Three Mile Island and Fuku-
shima Dai-ichi bear several

similarities, but also vast differ-
ences.
According to Kearfott, the
accident at Three Mile island led
to the implementation of drug
testing for employees and the
introduction of a better system
of communication among nucle-
ar power plants worldwide.
While the incident led to posi-
tive changes in the regulation
of nuclear power plants, Kear-
fott added she wanted to refrain
from a "post-analysis" of the
crisis in Japan since speculation
maybe premature.
However, Kearfott hypoth-
esized that as a result of the inci-
dent at Fukushima Dai-ichi, a
better system of analyzing cool-
ant pools and establishing back-
up coolant systems will most
likely be enacted. She noted
that coolant systems were a core
cause of the nuclear disaster in
Japan - a problem that should
be corrected out of concern for

the health of the people in and
around the plant.
The 9.0 magnitude quake and
tsunami hit Japan on March 11
and devastated the northern
part of the country. The official
death total has risen to 10,100
and more than 17,000 other peo-
ple are still missing.
Engineering senior Ryan Pen-
ney - who is studying nuclear
engineering and radiological
sciences and was the principal
organizer of the event - said in
an interview after the panel dis-
cussion that the purpose of the
event was to educate the public
about the crisis and its subse-
quent effects on the power plant
and individuals who live near it.
Penney said there has been
"too much speculation and pos-
sible misinformation by the
media" about the crisis, add-
ing that the event's purpose
was to provide a more scientific
approach to the recent events.

ST. LOUIS - Lounging in
the hotel and recovering from a
3-2 overtime win over Nebras-
ka-Omaha on Friday, the No. 6
Michigan hockey team couldn't
get comfortable.
On the TV in front of them,
upstart Colorado College was
 obliterating No. 1 seed Bos-
ton College with an eight-goal
onslaught.
But in the NCAA West
Regional final at the Scottrade
Center on Saturday, the Wolver-
ines decided to run away quickly
- with the lead. Michigan cap-

battened down the defensive
zone to secure a 2-1 victory and
the program's 24th Frozen Four
berth.
"For Colorado College to score
like they scored against argu-
ably the best team-in the country,
I think it put the fear of God in
our team," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said. "So we might
have played a little better defen-
sively just in respect for their
team."
Against the Mavericks on Fri-
day, the Wolverines entered the
first intermission trailing 2-0.
On Saturday, they flipped the
equation on its head.

opening stanza, senior forward
Scooter Vaughan collected the
puck in the neutral zone with
four defenders ahead of him.
Vaughan gained a step on the
defender with a nifty toe-drag,
and then flipped the puck over
Tigers goaltender Joe Howe's
glove-side shoulder.
The goal, Vaughan's 13th of
the year, gave Michigan the
quick 1-0 lead.
"I knew my man was a little
flat-footed," Vaughan said. "I just
used my speed and got by him
and got a good shot off above his
glove."

called Michigan an "old" team.
It wasn't a snub, or an offen-
sive remark, but simply a syn-
onym for the veteran experience
that showed up in St. Louis and
led the sixth-ranked Wolverines
to a 2-1 victory over the Tigers.
Being "old" is a good thing
when it translates to victories.
And no one showed their
age quite like senior netminder
Shawn Hunwick against Colo-

this team," senior forward Louie
Caporusso said following the
win.
Added Michigan coach Red
Berenson: "That's why we're
sitting here, is because of our
seniors. And Shawn really is a
senior. These "guys have been the
glue on our team and the leaders
on our team right from day one."
Playing a lead-by-example
role Saturday, Hunwick stepped
up at crucial moments in the
game to keep the surprisingly-
quiet Colorado College offense at
bay and setthe tone for Michigan

College on Friday, but Hunwick
stopped seven shots in each peri-
od on Saturday and only allowed
one goal in the game.
Colorado College's lone goal
came on their prolific power
play - one that Hunwick and
the defense shut down six other
times in the game. Colorado
College scored four power play
goals against the Wolverines
in the Great Lakes Invitational
championship game back in late
December, but Hunwick showed
his age - and experience - Sat-

SPORTSM:

AN

Madness in March offers solace in the underdog

WI7th graduation quick-
ly approaching, there
have been a whole lot
of times (daily almost) where
I've sat down and wondered
to myself
whether
sports writ-
ing is a good
profession
- or the right
profession, I
guess - for
me to embark RYAN
on for the rest KARTJE
of my life.
I know my
cold feet aren't anything new
for Michigan seniors all over
campus in my same position. I'm
sure you could find a handful of
quarter-life crises going on in
the UGLi about the very same
thing.
And I know - better than
most, I'd say - how an unpaid
summer internship doesn't real-
ly do much to soothe the soul.
For those of us who don't have
the most conventional job pros-
pects, there's even less solace.
I couldn't get this same
thought out of my head after
leaving Crisler Arena on Selec-
tion Sunday - likely my last on-
site reporting for The Michigan
Daily. Was there really hope for
me to do this for the rest of my

life? After all, I had been told,
as I'm sure many of you have,
that I should give up the dream
on my profession sooner rather
than later. My hope was waning
pretty fast.
SoI got home and turned on
my DVR'ed Selection Sunday
special. March had always been
my favorite month for sports -
there's no arguing March Mad-
ness is the greatest event in all
of sports - so I knew I could
find some comfort in combating
my employment sorrows with
bracket projections.
But the analysts, well-
schooled in bracketology,
couldn't offer me much hope.
Most of them took nothing but
chalk all the way to the Final
Four. "This is the year for No..
1's," Joe Lunardi, the ultimate
bracketologist, said.
For someone looking for hope
and searching for Cinderella,
Kansas, Duke, Ohio State and
Pittsburgh don't really spurn
much faith in a successful
underdog story.
And that's what we all tend
to feel like this time of year, on
the eve of great change. We're
all underdogs, in a way. There's
a reason why the nation got
behind George Mason when it
went on its Cinderella run in
2006. We all saw a little bit of

ourselves in the Patriots.
So I rebelled against the
chalk. I found my underdogs and
I stuck with them. Richmond
(yes!), Belmont (whoops), Gon-
zaga (eh).
And sure, I may have been a
little off on those choices. But if
there's something I've learned
in filling out my bracket for
a decade, it's that you should
always expect Madness when it
comes to March.
As I write this column, the
Virginia Commonwealth Rams,
an 11th seed that shouldn't have
been in the Tournament anyway,
just made the Final Four. They'll
take on Butler, the preeminent
Tourney underdog, in what
should be one of the most sto-
rybook Final Four matchups in
recent memory.
How can you not believe in
the magic of March when every
one of those guaranteed No. 1
seeds are out of the Tourna-
ment?
And if March Madness
doesn't offer enough solace for
you, take the Michigan hockey
team as an example.
Notorious chokers in the last
10 or so postseasons, Michigan
had already gone through its run
as a Cinderella last year, when
the Wolverines rode a pint-size
goalie to alate-season hot streak

Virginia Commonwealth coach Shaka Smart and his team have epitomized the underdog this March.

and a regional final berth.
This year, the pint-size goalie
thing wasn't as cute and the
Wolverines had serious expec-
tations. Then, they lost two of
their best scorers for extended
periods - Louie Caporusso and
David Wohlberg (who's out for
the rest of the season).
But as time winded down on
Saturday, Michigan was heading
to the Frozen Four. They had

overcome the odds and lived
up to the expectations. Now,
in two weeks, they'll try to do
something that no major sport
has done here in a while - bring
home a national championship
and vindicate the last four years
of underachieving sports teams.
So as VCU cut down the
nets and as Michigan sprinted
toward center ice, I realized
there wasn't much more inspira-

tion than this to an about-to-be-
graduated-with-no-career-plans
student. Crazy, crazy things can
and do happen against the odds
all the time.
And maybe, just maybe, we've
all got a little bit of VCU in us
this time of year. At least my
bank account hopes so.

On the other end of the ice,
senior goaltender Shawn Hun-
wick understood how vital the
first goal was. The Wolverines
have a 21-1-3 record when tally-
ing the first goal of the game.
"If they scored early tonight,
the momentum is going their
way and it's a totally different
game then," Hunwick said. "I
knew we would throw every-
thing at them, and I just had to
play my game."
In the closing minutes of the
period, Michigan fought off a
5-on-3 and was awarded its own
two-man advantage. And sopho-
more defenseman Lee Moffie
blasted a bouncing puck past
Howe from the right circle to
extend the lead to 2-0.
Colorado College - who
rebounded from a similar early
deficit against the Eagles on Fri-
day - was on its heels for good.
"We didn't have quite the
same jump as (Friday), we were
a little bit tired in some areas,"
Colorado College coach Scott
Owens said. "Part of that had to
do with Michigan - they're big,
they're strong, they're old and
they skate well."
Entering the first intermis-
sion backed by a pair of what
Berenson called "opportunistic
goals," the Wolverines turned
up their intensity - a trip to the
Frozen Four was just 40 minutes
away.
The depleted defensive corps
- with junior defenseman Bran-
don Burlon absent due to an
inflamed esophagus - took con-
trol. Hunwick faced just seven
shots in each of the first two
periods and a total of 22.
Meanwhile, the Michigan
offense didn't slow down, pelt-
ing Howe with 43 shots - 20 of
which came in the second period
alone.
"There were probably 30
minutes there in the middle

"I think they did have a few
pretty good shots early on,"
Hunwick said. "But this is an
opportunity to play for the Fro-
zen Four. I think I made a couple
good saves. It's prettyeasy to stay
in the game when you're playing
to go to the Frozen Four. They
didn't really get anything going
too much until they got into the
power play. Once they got into
the power play, I really had to be

Michigan lost to Notre Dame

job now," Langlais said.
THE MOFFIE MAN: Lee Mof-
fie loves the limelight.
After the No. 2 seed Michi-
gan's victory over No. 4 seed
Colorado College on Saturday,
Michigan coach Red Berenson
made a comment about Shawn
Hunwick being a leader. Moffie
sheepishly shook his head - to
the delight of the press corps.
But Moffie has been earning
the limelight all season. Late in
the first period, with the Wol-
verines on the power play, Mof-
fie let go of a slap shot that found
its way through everybody and
beat Tiger goalie Joe Howe on
the stick side.
"I had a pretty good scoring
chance, but there was a guy in
front of me," Moffie said. "It
went off his shin pads, the puck

regional final to coming out on
top in St. Louis, Hunwick has
consistently exceeded expecta-
tions alongthe way.
En route to Michigan's 24th
Frozen Four appearance, Hun-
wick notched 21 victories this
season - and has the opportu-
nity to snag two more in St. Paul
in two weeks.
He holds a 9-3 record in one-
goal games this season, includ-
ing Saturday's game against the
Tigers.
Hunwick wasvoted the CCHA
Best Goaltender prior to the con-
ference tournament and Most
Outstanding Player on the NCAA
West Regional All-Tournament
team on Saturday.
"It's just great to see guys like
that stepping up," senior forward
was sort of scrambling around.
I think I got sort of lucky. I
wasn't even sure at first that it
went in."
It was Moffie's eighth goal of
the season, and it put him ahead
of freshman defenseman Jon
Merrill to lead the team. A.year
removed from struggling to find
a spot in the lineup because of
his defensive play, Moffie has
found a spot on the blue line.
And his offense has kept him
there.
"We're all working (on
defense)," senior defenseman
Chad Langlais said. "You have
to be able to play defense on this
team to be trusted and be in the
lineup every night. I think that's
his biggest thing he's working
on.
"The goals are going to come.
He's got one of the best shots
I've ever seen."
KILL ZONE: With a man dis-
advantage, Michigan didn't just
kill penalties. It mutilated them.
The unit faced it all: a kill
while being down 2-0, where a
goal turns the momentum for
good, a penalty in. overtime, a
five-on-three. It didn't flinch en
route to killing 12-of-13 oppor-

Carl Hagelin said. "He's a great
guy, he's fun to be around. He's
worked hard for this. Freshman
year he stayed out on the ice
every day so all the other guys
could shoot, same with sopho-
more year.
Then, he got the chance junior
year to prove himself, and he
did. Since the Big Chill, he's been
playing really good for us."
Hunwick showed poise after
No. 14 Nebraska-Omaha scored
two unanswered goals inthe first
game of the NCAA Tournament

only goal came against Colorado
College, the eighth best power
play in the country, on the last
opportunity of the weekend.
Michigan's biggest kill came
with five minutes remaining in
the first period. Hanging on to
a two-goal lead, the unit faced a
five-on-three against the Tigers,
who converted on four of the
five power plays back in Decem-
ber against Michigan and three
of four against Boston College
a day earlier. It was killed. The
Wolverine penalty kill averaged
under two shots against for the
whole regional.
"I talked to coach (Billy)
Powers and he looked at video
and did a good job preparing
our penalty killers," Berenson
said. "When they did get shots,
(senior goalie) Shawn (Hun-

survived it, I thought we did a
much better job on the PK."

going," Owens said. "Michigan
was very sound defensively - I
can see why they've won 10 of
their last 11 or now, 11 of their
past 12 games."
In a penalty-filled game,
Michigan depended heavily on
its penalty-kill unit, which fin-
ished with only one dint in its
armor - a Tigers' goal from for-
ward Rylan Schwartz in the final
five minutes of the game.
In the race for a title, Michi-
gan's early breakaway speed
proved too much for the Tigers'
comeback hopes, sending the

Wolverines back to the Fro-
zen Four for the first time since
2008.
The buzzer sounded with
Colorado College swarming
around the net in one last des-
perate dash, effectively ending
the Tigers chase of a national
championship.
The Wolverines will travel
back to Ann Arbor and await the
outcome of the Midwest Region-
al final between No. 1 seed North
Dakota and No. 2 seed Denver.
Michigan will have a Frozen
Four date with the winner in St.
Paul, Minn. on April 7.

ST. MIKE'S
From Page 4B
Standing on Hill Street in front
of the Coliseum, and beside a
troupe of fellow Canucks, Watt
knew Ann Arbor already felt like
home.
But Watt had made a commit-
ment to North Dakota, and he
wanted to honor that obligation.
He drove through the night and
arrived in Grand Forks at six the
following morning.
"At nine o'clock I turned
around and said, 'There is no
way, this is so far from home,' "
Watt said. "So I told the coach,
'I can't do this. They offered me
a chance to go to Michigan, I'm
going to go to Michigan."'
That coach was Al Renfrew.
Just months later, Renfrew
replaced Heyliger at the helm
of the Wolverines - and Watt,
Renfrew's former North Dakota
recruit, was the first to greet him.
"I met him at the door, and
said, 'Coach, how are you? I'm
supposed to be in North Dakota,
aren't you too?'"
Michigan - having earned
six championship banners in the
NCAA Tournament's first nine
years of existence - was the
place to be.
And the Bathurst Brigade
fueled the nation's hockey pow-
erhouse.
Four years later, Watt finished
with his own All-American hon-
ors. Two hundred fifty miles
away from Davidson's office,
Watt finally knew he'd made the
right choice.
And just before he left Ann
Arbor, Watt agreed to show
another recruit around campus.
The young defenseman's name
was Tom Polanic - St. Mike's
must-have recruit at the time.
Former St. Mike's players
giving St. Mike's recruits tours
around the Michigan campus -
Renfrew had discovered how to
keep the pipeline alive.
When Red Berenson took
over as coach of Michigan
before the 1984 season, he inher-
ited a program that had captured
only one NCAA Tournament bid
since winning its last title exactly
two decades earlier.
Since the "decade of domi-
nance," the Michigan hockey
team lacked its usual luster.
What's more, the Wolverines
hadn't skated a product of St.
Mike's since Polonic and three
others played on the 1964 cham-
pionship team.
Berenson understood the
importance of bringing Cana-
dian talent back to Michigan and
unearthing the near-forgotten
pipeline between Toronto and
Ann Arbor.
Berenson knew the relation-
ship existed because the major-
ity of his teammates at Michigan
had come from Canada - and
the lion's share of them were St.
Mike's graduates.
"Everyone was from Canada
in those days," Berenson said.
"When I got here in the late 50s,
I think we had two Americans on
the team. One of my linemates, Al
Hinnegan, and our captain Bob
Watt were from St. Mike's."
In the 10 years after Michi-
gan coach Vic Heyliger's 1952
recruiting class, 14 players made

the crossover trek from St. Mike's
to Michigan. But in the second
half of Renfrew's tutelage, the
pipeline ran dry.
Berenson quickly revitalized
the relationship, heavily recruit-
ing Bryan Deasley, one of the
most highly touted Canadian for-
ward prospects of the mid-1980s.
After hearing Berenson's mis-
sion, Deasley was on board.

Over the next six years, Michi-
gan skated five Buzzer recruits,
including three-year captain
David Harlock.
Emblazoned along the
brick fagade of the arena is
St. Mike's mantra: TEACH ME
GOODNESS, DISCIPLINE AND
KNOWLEDGE.
Young men flood the halls
between class periods, each stu-
dent wearing dark khaki pants,
a white shirt, tie and dark blue
blazer. St. Mike's is no hockey
factory - the nation's only Cath-
olic all-male prep school churns
out the best hockey players and
students.
Bob Schiller, one of the pio-
neers of the pipeline in the early
1950s, recognized the demand
for academic excellence at both
St. Mike's and Michigan.
"It was a joint venture," said
Schiller, who majored in aero-
nautical engineering at Michi-
gan. "You knew you were going
to play hockey at a good level,
and you got to keep the education
going as well.
"The education at St. Mike's
was very rigid. They're Basilian
priests, and they were tough. But
because you played sports, you
didn't get any breaks."
And as if the caliber of stu-
dents the school graduated
wasn't enough, the Basilian
Fathers of St. Mike's have been
sure to keep hockey in check for
the past century.
In the mid-1960s, the hockey
program shut down altogeth-
er. It certainly was no burden
financially; on the contrary, the
Fathers had determined hockey
at St. Mike's had become so pro-
fessional that it was overshadow-
ing the academics.
And for a college hockey coach,
these players are simply a differ-
ent breed.
"Kids are different in every
era, but there's something differ-
ent about kids from St. Mike's,"
Berenson said. "They can relate
to what's going on at Michigan."
Without the school's dedica-
tion to education, the connection
with college hockey might never
have existed.
And without the feeder rela-
tionship with St. Mike's, Michi-
gan wouldn't be the program it
is today. Of the Wolverines' nine
national championship teams, all
but one title roster has fielded a
player from St. Mike's.
But the most striking con-
nection between Michigan
and St. Mike's is the one that
got away. More specifically, "The
Next One" that got away.
In 1989, 16-year-old Eric Lin-
dros, playing his first and only
year at St. Mike's, was already
considered one of the greatest
prospects ever. The London, Ont.
native's on-ice accolades quickly
earned him the nickname, "The
Next One," prophesied as the sec-
ond coming of "The Great One" -
Wayne Gretzky.
But in the 1989 OHL draft, Lin-
dros was used as a pawn by Phil
Esposito, then-part-owner of the
Sault. Ste. Marie Greyhounds.
Knowing that Lindros would
refuse to move 500 miles away
from home and drop his edu-
cation to join the Greyhounds,
Esposito selected Lindros as the
first overall pick.
The Sault Ste. Marie franchise

was financially desperate, and
the owners knew that select-
ing Lindros would skyrocket its
value. And it worked. Fortunately
for the Greyhounds, the OHL had
a rule that prohibited trading
first-round draft picks for a full
year after the draft.
The franchise sold, but it lost
Lindros's respect.
"The whole episode showed

me that hockey is a bottom-
line business, even at the junior
level," Lindros wrote on his per-
sonal website. "I felt like a piece
of meat."
Instead, Lindros looked to the
NCAA.
His family had already visited
Michigan a few months earlier,
but he was still more than a year
away from eligibility.
Berenson's team had complet-
ed its second-consecutive win-
ning season, but the coach knew
Lindros would be a landmark
addition, bringing the Wolver-
ines back to national prominence.
When Lindros first visited
before the OHL draft, Beren-
son was sure to make the right
impression.
Berenson called Lindros
into his office with an offer he
hoped the 6-foot-4 power for-
ward wouldn't be able to pass up.
Hanging in the coaches' room
when Lindros entered was a tra-
ditional white Michigan jersey,
with the trademark 'M' on the
chest. Berenson then revealed
the back of the sweater: LIN-
DROS 88.
Lindros had been No. 8 at St.
Mike's, but Berenson was making
a statement.
"I didn't let anyone have a high
number back then," Berenson
said. "But (Lindros) was big time,
and we knew that. Gretzky was
99 - I gave Lindros 88."
The offer was made and the
decision was left up to Lindros.
He chose Michigan.
In an effort to keep the star
recruit nearby, Berenson gave
Lindros' family the number of
Andy Weidenbach, the coach
of Detroit-based Compuware,
a team in the Tier-II hockey
league. For the fall semester, Lin-
dros tore up the ice just 40 min-
utes from Michigan.
But a rule change allowed
Sault Ste. Marie to trade Lindros
to the Oshawa Generals for three
players, two top draft choices,
$80,000 cash and two more play-
ers sent in the span of two years.
Experts estimated the price for
the 16-year-old ended up at over
a half-million dollars.
Lindros returned to Ontario,
never playing a game for Michi-
gan, but it was a give-and-take
with him. Michigan gave him No.
88, which he wore for the remain-
der of his career - a 13-year NHL
career after being drafted first
overall at age 18 by the Quebec
Nordiques in 1991.
And Lindros gave back in a dif-


ferent way.
In his short stint with Com-
puware, a Detroit-based Tier II
level program, Lindros made a
profound impact on a certain
teammate - defenseman Mark
Sakala.
Sakala, then a senior at River-
view High School, was a gifted
student, but was disappointed
with the inability to find an edu-
cational institution that coupled
his passion for hockey with rigor-
ous academics.
Enter Lindros, who, alongwith
his parents, convinced Sakala's
parents to head to Toronto and
spend a year at St. Mike's, play-
ing alongside Lindros's brother,
Brett Lindros.
Sakala took their advice,
enrolling at St. Mike's for a 13th
year of school.
A year later, Sakala had his
name on the duct and a Michigan
'M' on his sweater - Lindros had
neither.

championships, but because they
did it on both sides - academics
and athletics."
Dressed in a black sweater,
jeans and a silver wristwatch,
Sakala is the picture of success.
Wearing a national title ring,
and as a top-flight engineer for
Chrysler living in Birmingham,
Mich., Sakala understands that
the word 'champion' is a dichot-
omy.
"If you look at some of the
other schools that were strictly
hockey factories, they've come
and gone. They weren't consis-
tent, like Lake State, who was a
powerhouse when I was there.
Jeff Jackson was the coach, Doug
Weight came out of there, a lot
of good players. But they were
strictly a hockey factory, that's
what mattered most. And where
are they now?"
Sakala left the question unan-
swered.

He knows that sports don't
exist in a vacuum. This goes
beyond the rink.
Sakala knows that better than
anyone. The 'Big Two' at Chrys-
ler LLC - Chairman C. Robert
Kidder and Chief Executive Offi-
cer Sergio Marchionne - are
Michigan graduates.
And Marchionne, the 58-year-
old man dubbed the "savior of
Chrysler" after being charged
with rebuilding the bankrupted
corporation, learned his trade as
a student at St. Mike's.
"With St. Mike's, it's that enti-
ty - both academics and hockey
- thatpreparedme for Michigan,
prepared Sergio to be top dog at
Chrysler," Sakala says, setting his
drink down. "At Michigan, it's
the same thing."
St. Mike's and Michigan.
Captains on the ice, captains
of industry, Michigan's finest -
imported from St. Mike's.

Light flickers off the golden
band as Sakala leans back in his
chair, slowly turning the 1996
championship ring around his
finger.
The head of the ring bears a
raised edge encircling a deep
blue background, all centered on
a gold block 'M.'
Without a second thought,
he says a date he'll never forget:
March 30, 1996.
Sakala removes the ring,
showing the proof engraved on
the back.
March 30. It was the day
Berenson won his 300th game
and completed the turnaround -
recapturing Michigan's heyday
glory after a 32-year drought.
It was the day Brendan Mor-
rison knocked in a Bill Muckalt The Barn on
rebound to topple Colorado Col-
lege 3-2 in overtime and then
proclaimed, "This is for all the
(Michigan) guys who never had a
chance to win it."
And it was the day Sakala at
the end of the bench realized he
almost never had that chance
either. Without Eric Lindros, he
wouldn't have been there. With-
out St. Mike's, he wouldn't have
been there.
And without his engineering
degree necessitating a fifth year
- no chance.
When he reflects, Sakala
doesn't think about the cham-
pionship. He thinks about the
championship mentality that
carried him and his teammates
to where they are today. Three
doctors, a lawyer, a Princeton
law graduate, a Michigan profes-
sor, the assistant general man-
ager of the Pittsburgh Penguins
and three current NHLers - that 9
Wolverine team knew success.
It wasn't just a hockey team,
Sakala asserts, it was the perfect
combination of education and
athletics that makes Michigan
unique.
"They were winners there and
winners on the rink and in life, in
both realms," Sakala said, paus-
ing for a moment to sip his cof-
fee. "It's not so much that hockey
made them winners, I really feel
like it's the entity of the two."
And it's that blend that built
the pipeline between St. Mike's
and Michigan.
"It's the best of both worlds," 5
Sakala says. "Both of those
schools produce winners. Both
are championship programs not

MICHIGAN AND ST. MICHAEL'S COLLEGE SCHOOL

The first thing you notice is the last
thingyou'd expect.
In the center of the locker room at
St. Michael's College School Arena lies
a dark blue block 'M.' Seven feet above
it and just beneath the low-lying ceil-
ing, a pair of white L-shaped heating
ducts converge in the center of the
room. On both sides of the duct, names
are scrawled in precise, capitalized
black lettering.
Beside each name, a system tracks
each player's progress: one dot if draft-
ed, three for playing in the NHL. Each
name is followed by the university that
the player attended.
Here, in the heart of hockey country,
lies a true anomaly.
At St. Michael's College School, a
program renown for producing nearly
300 NHLers and 14 Hall of Famers, the
names most prominent in the locker
room are college players - those who
spurned the money of professional
hockey for an education.
For Canadian players, going to the
OHL is the rule. St. Mike's is the excep-
tion.
"They've always been known for
sending people to college," Michigan
senior and 2007 St. Mike's graduate
Louie Caporusso said. "They take a lot
of pride in that. I feel like people get a
lot more respect in Toronto for goingto
St. Mike's rather than the (OHL)."
And no program has benefited from
St. Mike's unique dedication to col-
lege hockey more than the Michigan
hockey program. Six All-Americans
and more than 25 players have made
the trek from Toronto to Ann Arbor in
the last 60 years.
The duct in the locker room at St.
Mike's isn't just a heating vent - it's an

idyllic representation of the unwritten
pipeline binding two hockey main-
stays: St. Mike's andMichigan.
Just around the corner in the St.
Mike's locker room, a plaque sits at eye-
level on the wall.
It's the only plaque in the room dedi-
cated to a single player. It's for the son
of St. Mike's - the one who did it right.
That son is Andrew Cogliano.
Cogliano, a Toronto native, came to
St. Mike's in seventh grade and played
for every possible St. Mike's-affiliated
team from the under-14 team to the
Double Blues high school team to the
Buzzers, an Ontario Provincial Junior
'A' team, until he left to become a Wol-
verine in 2005.
The plaque remembers him, and
so does the duct. The plaque shows
Cogliano at center ice at the "Barn
on Bathurst Street," and details the
accomplishments of his last year as a
Buzzer.
66 assists (St. Mike's record)
102 points (St. Mike's record)
6-3-goal games
1- 4-goal game
But Cogliano is the program's post-
er-child not because of these accom-
plishments, but what he did after St.
Mike's.
Though everyone in the land knew
Cogliano would end up in the NHL -
where he is today, as a fifth-year player
for the Edmonton Oilers - he didn't
take the fast track.
He traded his light blue St. Mike's
No. 7 sweater for No. 9 as a Wolverine,
and never regretted it.
"Michigan was kind of the one team
that I grew up watching," Cogliano
said Thursday. "The idea of going to
college and playing there and going to
school, it seemed like the right place to
be."
Cogliano was drafted 25th overall
by Edmonton in the 2005 NHL Entry
Draft, but he made his way to Ann
Arbor anyway.
"It gave me a chance to develop,"
Cogliano said. "I didn't rush in juniors
or in college; I took my time. Playing
for both schools got me ready in the
sense of making me mature, growing
up as a man and be ready for the pro-
fessional life and the life of an NHL
hockey player."
Under Michigan coach Red Beren-
son's watchful eye, Cogliano flourished
at Michigan, earning more than a point
per game in his two seasons. After his
sophomore year, Cogliano punched his
