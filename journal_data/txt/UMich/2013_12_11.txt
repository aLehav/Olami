Org s renovation goals

Student group hosts
town hall to start
conversation on
campus upgrades
By ANDREW ALMANI
Daily StaffReporter
At Building a Better Michi-
gan's first town-hall meeting
Tuesday, students gathered
to learn about and discuss the
organization's goals and initia-
tives, for upcoming construction
projects at the University.
Building a Better Michigan

was founded nearly three years
ago to provide a stronger stu-
dent voice in the University's
regular construction and reno-
vation projects
At the town hall Tuesday,
students had the opportunity to
learn about the group's mission,
engage in dialogue with mem-
bers and express suggestions
for the upcoming renovation of
various buildings on campus.
In April 2013, the group's
grassroots campaign to initiate
a series of renovation projects
succeeded, with the Board of
Regents voting to implement
a $65 student fee each term to
fund improvements beginning

with the class of 2018. A poll was
conducted among the student
body, finding that 67 percent
of students supported the fee
proposed. The total cost of the
projects is estimated to be $173
million.
The renovations are orga-
nized into three phases, with
the first two focused on identi-
fying the buildings most in need
of renovation and requiring spe-
cial attention to their unique
architectural and symbolic heri-
tage. Phase three will consist
of changes to exclusively North
Campus buildings.
Sites affected by the initiative
will include the Central Cam-

pus Recreation Building, North
Campus Recreation Building,
Intramural Sports Building,
Mitchell Field, the Michigan
Union and Pierpont Commons.
Phases two and three are still in
the process of being planned and
will not begin until 2021.
However, some projects will
be completed as early as the Fall
2014 semester. Pierpont Com-
mons Caf6 is currently at the end
of the schematic design phase,
with plans for extended oper-'
ating hours, an expanded salad
bar, visiting vendors during the
summer time, hearth pizza and

New network
offers Wi-Fi
for the masses

SO MUCH DRAMA

Eduroam allows
for global access on
member campuses
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
Sandwiched between MWire-
less and MGuest on the Univer-
sity's Wi-Fi dropdown menu,
eduroam is the new kid in town.
Though the network appeared
on the wireless scene not too long
after students and faculty adjust-
ed to the phase-out of UM Wire-
less Network, University officials
are characterizing eduroam as
more than a simple network
addition or reconfiguration.
Unlike MWireless, eduroam
is a global program that allows
members of subscribing institu-
tions to access the highest avail-
able Internet speed at any other
4 member institution in the world.
With eduroam, a University
professor attending a conference
at Stanford University - an edu-
roam member institution - can
have their unigname authen-
ticated and access the highest

speed connection available to the
Stanford community.
While the University has been
participating in this program for
a few years, faculty from other
eduroam institutions and the
University's faculty and staff will
have access to eduroam in Ann
Arbor for the first time.
Andy Palms, executive direc-
tor of communication systems
and data centers for the Univer-
sity's Information and Tech-
nology Services, said eduroam
makes it easier for faculty and
students visiting other universi-
ties to achieve the best available
connectivity.
"Eduroam facilitates collabo-
ration by giving people instant
best access," Palms said.
Eduroam has been employed
in 67 countries so far, accord-
ing to Brook Schofield, a proj-
ect development officer for
Amsterdam-based TERENA, the
Trans-European Research and
Education Network. TERENA
is an association of research and
education institutions that devel-
oped the idea for eduroam.

Resolution requires
that student leaders
approve all proposed
changes to statement
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The Central Student Govern-
ment has proposed a resolution
to make amendments to the
University Statement of Student
Rights and Responsibilities more
accessible to the student body.
The resolution mandates
that CSG approve all proposed
amendments to the Code of Con-
duct, which CSG does not have
exclusive control over in the cur-
rent system. If it passes the CSG
assembly during Winter 2014,
a signed copy of the resolution
will be sent to E. Royster Harper,
vice president of student life, and
other University administrators
for approval.

Editors hope to
improve diversity,
spur collaboration
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
The Michigan Daily has
wrapped up a three-week long
process of selecting new man-
aging editors and an editor-

in-chief for the upcoming two
semesters.
Two of the positions, edi-
tor in chief and co-editorial
page editors, were elected at
large by the staff of the Daily
on Nov. 15. All other sections
of the paper - news, arts,
copy, sports, photo and design
- elected their respective edi-
tors internally and the outgo-
ing class of managing editors
appointed the managing editor

and magazine editor.
After facing multiple hours
of questioning by Daily staff,
Business junior Peter Shahin
was elected editor-in-chief for
the 2014 calendar year. Sha-
hin, previously a senior news
editor, said one of his priorities
will be increasing the accessi-
bilityof Daily content.
"It's not so much moving
away from print journalism,"

Looters roam
streets as authorities
continue strike
over higher pay
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
(AP) - Many Argentines armed
and barricaded themselves in
their homes and stores in fear
of looting mobs Tuesday as the
nation's celebration of 30 years
of uninterrupted democracy
were marred by police strikes
for higher pay.
Politicians struggled to
assert their authority over secu-
rity forces even as they agreed
to salary increases so steep that
many provinces won't be able to
pay their debts at month's end,
adding stress to an economy
already suffering from 25 per-
cent inflation.
President Cristina Fernan-
dez sought to contain the cri-
sis Tuesday night, charging
that anti-democratic elements
were trying to undo Argentina's
hard-won gains. "We must con-
demn the extortion of those
who carry arms to defend soci-
ety," she declared.
The speech was her first
response to a weeklong series
of provincial police strikes.
As officers abandoned their
posts, and in some cases alleg-
edly encouraged, violence to
pressure authorities, many of
Argentina's 23 provinces have
endured long nights of chaos as
roving groups smashed through
storefronts and fought over the
merchandise inside.
Hospital and political
authorities said at least seven
people had been killed, includ-
ing a police offiPer in northern
Chaco province who was struck
by a bullet below his protective
vest Tuesday and a store owner
whose burned body was found
last week in his looted and
torched market in Buenos Aires
province.
The others allegedly died
while looting. One young man

was electrocuted while steal-
ing from an appliance store in
a rainstorm. Another fell off a
motorcycle while carting off a
television. A third died in a fist-
fight over stolen goods inside a
ruined store.
Hundreds have been injured
and thousands of businesses
damaged in the scattered vio-
lence. While most officers were
back at work after securing new
deals, police uprisings contin-
ued Tuesday in several cities.
Commerce has beei shut down
in many places, and even some
public hospitals have turned
away non-emergency patients
for fear of being looted.
With consumer prices soar-
ing, Argentines are accustomed
to annual labor protests in
which workers threaten chaos
if they don't get their way.
But strikes by armed police
are more ominous in a coun-
try where social chaos, police
crackdowns and spiraling vio-
lence ushered in the 1976 mili-
tary coup and a world-record
debt default in 2001.
"This was executed and
planned with surgical preci-
sion," Fernandez said in her
speech marking the end of the
last military junta. She claimed
many people became unwit-
ting instruments of extortion
by police who "liberated" areas
where looting could happen.
"We have promoted the inte-
gration of the armed forces into
democratic processes, and the
same must be done with pro-
vincial police, once and for all,"
she said.
To free up cash for the rais-
es, her Cabinet chief, Jorge
Capitanich, announced a three-
month delay in payments most
Argentine provinces owe this
month to the federal govern-
ment on debts refinanced two
years ago.
Human rightsgroupswarned
against giving in too easily to
the security forces' demands.
The deal Buenos Aires Gov.
Daniel Scioli reached with
rebellious officers Monday

night includes an amnesty for
rule-breaking officers, making
them eligible for 14,000 prom-
ised promotions this month
that will raise salaries far
above the base pay he prom-
ised. The deal also lets officers
who retired on 90 percent pay
to return to work at twice their
old salaries.
"The weapons given to secu-
rity forces to 'protect citizens'
life and property cannot be
used to force decisions by con-
stitutional powers," warned
the Center for Legal and Social
Studies, a human rights group
that has closely tracked police
abuse. "We think it's urgent
that the security forces stop
intensifying the violence and
feeding incidents that pose very
high risks to our society and its
institutions."
Tuesday marked three
decades since President Raul
Alfonsin's inauguration ended
the 1976-1983 dictatorship. Fer-
nandez invited all political par-
ties to assemble on-a huge stage
in front of the presidential pal-
ace for a long night of speeches
and music to celebrate democ-
racy's consolidation.
The late president's son, leg-
islator Ricardo Alfonsin, and
Buenos 'Aires Mayor Mauri-
cio Macri both said the party
should be called off, given the
potential for another night of
violence. Alfonsin called for
"all political sectors to commit
together to defend the democ-
racy and its institutions."
The event went on as sched-
uled, however, and shortly
after the president spoke, word
spread that deals had been *
struck with police in Tucuman
and Santa Fe, two of the last
provinces where officers were
holding out for higher pay.
Still, even governors who
restored calm by agreeing to
steep police pay raises days
earlier seemed wary of declar-
ing victory. Strikes by public
health workers are spreading,
and other public employees are
clamoring for raises, too.

EVICTIONS
From Page 1A
forced evictions are possibly the
most traumatic single event in
Palestinian history.
She added that SAFE mem-
bers were not the only students
involved in the event, but that
people in a number of activist
groups across campus took part.
Khalil said there has been tre-
mendous support for the move-
ment and its associated hashtag,
#UMMockEviction, so far, espe-
cially from communities of color.
"We really want to get this
discussion going on campus and
not have it be silenced," Khalil
said. "It seems like the University
doesn't act until it's forced to ...
we decided to do something that
speaks directly to the students."
However, many students
were offended by the event and
the University has indicated
the move violated the residence
hall's no-soliciting policy. Uni-
versity of Michigan Hillel sent
out an e-mail to members rec-
ognizing that students reported
feeling unsafe after the eviction
notices were sent out. and said
they had contacted University
administrators.
Hillel held an event Tuesday
eveningwhere about 40 students
gathered to share their concerns.
Hillel Executive Director Tilly
Shames said Hillel's event aimed
to create a safe space where stu-
dents could share how they felt
impacted.
"The collective values of
community and civil discourse
were shattered by this incident,"
Shames said.
in small group discussions,
students revealed that they felt
powerless after the flyers cir-
culated in people's residential
spaces. LSA junior Rachel Klein,
the Israel Programs Chair and an
organizer of the event, noted that
she felt caught off guard given
the politically-charged nature of
the controversy and that the tim-
ing during finals was intentional.
Khalil acknowledged Hillel's
issue with the event, but said it
was troublesome that the silenc-
ing of the movement was coming
through the co-option of social
justice words.
"Being triggered does not
mean that you cannot be held
accountable for how violence has
affected Palestinians," she said.
LSA senior Suha Najjar, a
member of SAFE and a Pales-
tinian American, said it seemed
absurd that students would con-
strue criticism against Israel
as being anti-Semitic. She also
pointed out that the fliers were
clearly marked as fake.
She said the students need to
be cognizant of the issues and
the University needs to be held
accountable for its actions.t
"I don't think that Palestin-
ians had the choice when their
houses were being bulldozed by
companies that benefitted from
our tuition dollars," Najjar said.
University Housing spokes-
man Peter Logan said the dem-
onstration was in violation of
University Housing's, policy,

A key focus of the meeting
was the launch of the Building
a Better Michigan Core Group,
which will allow students to
meet with and advise architects
and administrators, begin-
ning next semester. The Core
will also conduct research and
create focus groups to better
understand the needs of 'stu-
dents.
"Students looking for low
time commitment that has a
high impact on the University,
that's what the Core is for," said

which prohibits handing out fly-
ers and other types of marketing'
activities.
"The residence halls are actu-
ally private residences, and in the
interest of preserving the sense
of privacy and security for our
residents, we don't allow solici-
tation, even from recognized
student organizations, not even
from housing organizations,"
Logan said.
The flyer was labeled "Depart-
ment of Housing," which is not
the official name for University
Housing. Because the letter also
wasn't explicitly labeled as being
distributed by SAFE, Logan said
he was concerned that the group
was trying to impersonate Uni-
versity Housing.
"We weren't really happy with
them using our name to carryout
their statement, per se," Logan
said, adding that the message
upset some housing residents.
SAFE took responsibility for
handing out flyers and expand
in a viewpoint in Tuesday's edi-
tion of the Michigan Daily. Khalil
said SAFE did not put its name
on the flier because the group
wanted to draw attention away
from themselves and focus on the
larger issue and the University's
involvement.
"It's something that if you
really want to make a statement,
you have to work around the
rules, bend the rules, to do what
you can," Khalil said.
She said theviewpoint allowed
the group to take ownership and
not hide from culpability.
Logan said University Housing
has informed the SAFE executive
board that they violated Housing
policy and asked them to refrain
from handing out flyers in the
future. He added that University
Housing does allow, with proper
permission, for solicitation tables
in the residence halls to help orga-
nizations reach out to residents.
Central Student Government
began its Tuesday meeting by
acknowledging the eviction
notice and its effect on the cam-
pus community. LSAsenior Molly
Rosen, former vice speaker of the
CSG Assembly, spoke onbehalf of
those "whose personal space was
violated" when the notices were
distributed throughout campus.
Business junior Skyler Pursell, a
current assembly representative
and residential advisor, said he
woke up to several residents who
were startled by the fliers.
Linda Newman, -the Univer-
sity's director of Housing, and
Laura Blake Jones, the Univer-
sity's dean of students, also sent
an e-mail to all housing residents
explaining that University Hous-
ing did not sanction the eviction
notices and apologizing for any
shock they may have caused.
"We are sorry that the flyers
caused shock, alarm, and other
emotions among some residents,"
the e-mail reads. "We do not con-
done any behavior that causes
members of our community to
feel targeted and/or intimidated."

"We are valuing student input

LSA senior Louis Mirante,
BBM board member, spoke about
the diversity of input he has seen
from students. He shared the
story of a female student who
felt uncomfortable using swim-
ming pools alongside the oppo-
site sex due to religious reasons,
and expressed a desire to allo-
cate times for gender-separated
swimming.
"That's a perspective I would
never have thought of, coming
from my background," Mirante
said. "I really appreciate being
exposed to views I would be
unfamiliar with otherwise."

stantly working to improve the
reliability of the service.
"It's a community effort, so as
the community grows in size, the
improvements continue to ben-
efit a large pool of users," Schofield
said. "The nextbig improvement in
eduroam will come from the com-
munity, as it always has, and we
welcome ideas and suggestions."
At the University, 847 indi-
viduals authenticated a wire-
less connection via eduroam in
November, according to data
provided by University Informa-
tion and Technology Services. Of

those individuals, 47 were Uni-
versity officials connecting local-
ly and 86 from non-University
locations.
Of the remaining authenticat-
ed networks, 440 were non-UM
individuals who connected from
locations at the University. These
individuals represented 152 differ-
ent institutions and 23 countries.
"It's certainly not as heavily
used as MWireless, but the use is
important," Palms said. "It would
be great to be able to have a con-
ference and be able to provide
visiting researchers with the best
access to our researchers while
they're here."
Robert Ball, a University
research scientist, said an infor-

mal poll conducted during a
conference of information tech-
nology administrators and engi-
neers hostedby the Department of
Physics last month showed about
two-thirds of the 100 attendees
were using eduroam wireless
connections, which allowed them
high bandwidth connectivity to
their home institution's sites.
"The community of users who
joined us for this conference
came from around the world,"
Ball said. "Since these were infra-
structure people, and networks
are an integral part of their work,
they expected good networking
capabilities and were not disap-
pointed."
Ball added that eduroam and

other efforts toward increased
connectivity are indicative of a
collaborative emphasis between
institutions.
Palms said the Internet origi-
nated when a few higher edu-
cation institutions first built
supercomputers and wanted to
allow other institutions to be able
to use them.
"It's been the intent for
decades for higher education
institutions to share resources,"
Palms said. "Higher education
institutions compete and col-
laborate, but from an informa-
tion technology perspective, it's
much more on the collaboration
side. The focus is really on how
we can share access."

Shahin said. "We're making sure
that we appeal to readers on as
many platforms as we can. So
we recognize that although print
journalism will continue to be a
valuable core part of our experi-
ence here at the paper, we need
to make sure that our content is
accessible wherever our readers
may be."
Additionally, Shahin said he
wants to work on ensuring that
staff and coverage are representa-
tive of the diversity of identities
and interest present on campus.
LSA senior Daniel Wang and
LSA sophomore Megan McDon-
ald, incoming co-editorial page
editors, also said they plan to
make the issue of diversity at the
Daily their focus.
"I think it's something we've
just started to address as an orga-
nization," Wang said. "It's prob-
ably what's going to define our
terms here as editors, if not for
other editors - I can't speak for
everyone."
McDonald agreed, adding that
one way that they'll approach this
goal is through establishing a dif-
ferent atmosphere at their edito-
rial board meetings.
"It's something where we have

to create a safe space for discus-
sion, because that's what we
want, but ultimately balancing
that with trying to have a discus-
sion and trying to get ideas out,"
McDonald stated.
For newly appointed Manag-
ing Editor Katie Burke, a Public
Policy junior, discussion will be
a priority as well. Burke, previ-
ously a senior news editor said
she plans to introduce an event
hosting function in the newsroom
to bring more attention to the
Daily's coverage.
"The goal of these events is to
open up the Daily to the rest of
campus and facilitate a discussion
about whatever news is going on:
get the reporters to be able to talk
about whatever they're writing
about, get professors in here, just
a variety of voices to kind of get
the discussion going," Burke said.
LSA sophomore Jennifer Cal-
fas, the managing news editor,
wants to expand coverage of
research done at the University.
"I know our editors and our
reporters on research are very well
versed and havebuilt great relation-
ships there, so I think that's very
possible,"she said."As well, we have
a presidential transition over this
next year, so that's something we're
really goingto focus on."
LSA juniors Alejandro Zdniga
and Greg Garno, newly elected

co-managing sports editors, said
their primary goal is to support
new talent in the section.
"The one thing we want to do
is build a stronger foundation for
our younger writers and less expe-
rienced writers, so that way when
we leave this section, we've left it
in abetter place," Garno said.
Zuniga and Garno also said
they wanted to expand the sec-
tion online.
"We have all these people writ-
ing great features, and they come
out in print and they look awe-
some - the design staff does a
great job - but we want to trans-
late that to online, because we feel
like a lot of people aren't going
to pick up a physical copy of the
Daily and sit down and read 3,000
words," Zuniga said.
LSA sophomore John Lynch
and Engineering junior Akshay
Seth were elected co-managing
arts editors. They plan to change
the way the B-Side - the weekly
Arts inserted section - is edited
instead giving that responsibility
to the senior editors.
Newly elected co-managing
photo editors, LSA junior Teresa
Mathew and Public Policy junior
Paul Sherman, said they also plan
to make online development a focus.
LSA freshman Carolyn Gearig
and LSA sophomore Gaby
Vasquez were elected managing

design editors. Vasquez said it's
important that the section col-
laborates with other sections to
increase visual storytelling.
Gearig also said that she and
Vasquez are would like to see at
least one infographic run in the
paper every week.
LSA junior Carlina Duan,
newly appointed editor for the
Daily's Statement magazine, said
her focus will be on increased
interactivity with the magazine's
readers.
"I would specifically like to
focus on expanding Internet con-
tent this year, and also just to have
content in the stories that keep on
pushing the boundaries and chal-
lenging students to view topics in
unexpected way," Duan said.
LSA juniors Meaghan Thomp-
son and Mark Ossolinski, the
paper's newly elected co-copy
chiefs, said their main goals will
be bringing more diversity to the
section and adding to the Daily's
style guide.
"That will definitely get some
tweaks while we're here," Thomp-
son said. "There are definitely
times when stuff that probably
should be in there, or we should
have a style on, isn't in there."
Ossolinski agreed, adding that
it's traditionally been a responsi-
bility of the copy desk to keep the
style guide current.


CSG
From Page 1A
Law student Jeremy Keeney,
student general counsel to the
CSG executive, said this modifica-
tion would begin to mend the cur-
rent system, under whichboth the
Office of Student Conflict Resolu-
tion and faculty can submit pro-

posed amendments directly to the
Student Relations Advisory Com-
mittee without consulting CSG.
"The code is kind of viewed as
a community standard, and really
having the folks that make up the
biggest part of that community -
the 40-some-thousand students
here - have a greater voice in the
process could only help build the
community that we have," Kee-

ney said.
Keeney said the proposed
changes to the amendment pro-
cess are a small but an important
first step to increase transparency
and student involvement in forg-
ing the code of conduct.
"This puts us ina place where we
can voice our concerns before (an
amendment) gets passed, whereas
before SRAC could pass it and we

wouldn't hear about the change
until it was too late," Keeney said.
While the changes under cur-
rent consideration are procedur-
al, Keeney said the last part of the
resolution will involve changing
the rights and responsibilities of
students as outlined by the State-
ment of Student Rights. The CSG
assembly will address this further
in February.

GM exec. first woman to head auto company

Former product
chief Barra set to
replace Akerson
DETROIT (AP) - Mary Barra
has spent the past three years as
General Motors' product chief,
making cars that drive better, last
longer and look good inshowrooms.
Now she will take on an even
bigger job. On Tuesday, the board
tapped the 33-year company vet-
eran to be the next CEO, mak-
ing her the first woman to lead a
major car company.
Barra replaces Dan Akerson,
who moved up retirement plans

by several months to help his wife,
Karin, battle advanced cancer.
When Barra starts her new job
Jan. 15, she will lead a company
that's made nearly $20 billion
since emerging from bankruptcy
in 2010, much of it from the cars
and trucks she helped develop.
But she still faces challenges in
paring down GM's costs and win-
ning over buyers in international
markets such as India and South
America.
Akerson, 65, said he had
planned to stay at least until
spring, but his wife's diagno-
sis changed that. He said 'the
board unanimously picked Barra
from several internal candidates

because of the breadth of her
experience, her management
record, her people skills and her
understanding of GM's opera-
tions.
"This is an executive who has a
vision of where she wants to take
the organization," he said.
Since February 2011, Barra has
held what many say is the most
important job at GM - senior
vice president for global prod-
uct development. She joined the
company in 1980 as an engineer-
ing student and became a plant
manager, executive director of
engineering and head of human
resources.
Along the way, she earned a

reputation as a manager who
made tough decisions, yet was
able to get people to follow her
lead and work as ateam, accord-
ing to current and former GM
executives.
The 51-year-old executive has
been in charge of design, engineer-
ing and quality for all GM vehicles
and has shepherded most of the
company's recent new vehicle
introductions. Under her com-
mand, GM rolled out brawny new
full-size pickup trucks, the Chev-
rolet Silverado and GMC Sierra,
and the Chevrolet Impala full-size
car, which earned the highest
score for asedan intestingby Con-
sumer Reports magazine.

Improving prison life
Michigan must reassess living conditions and sentencing guidelines
ast week, in an e-mail to the Livingston County Board of Commis-
sioners, Sheriff Bob Bezotte criticized Livingston County Jail's poor
living conditions, urging the commissioners to take action. The
e-mail included a photograph of the jail's crowded sleeping arrangements for
female inmates, displaying eight prisoners sleeping on the floor of a small
intake cell. Last Friday, the Livingston County Daily Press & Argus received
the e-mail through a Freedom of Information Act request, moving the situ-
ation into the public eye. The unacceptable conditions in Livingston County
is just one example of the subpar living conditions prisoners across the state
face. Gov. Rick Snyder's call for a prison overhaul needs to include better liv-
ing conditions, mental health services and security conditions for prisoners.

t Racism is not merely a
simplistic hatred.It
is, more often, broad
sympathy toward
some and broad-
er skepticism
toward others."
The words of
writer Ta-Nehisi
Coates echoed
through my head
as I scrolled JAMES
through hun- BRENNAN
dreds of #BBUM
tweets - a move-
ment about Being Black at the Uni-
versity of Michigan - reading about
the challenges Black students face
on campus. Some are as subtle as
being glared at during walks to class,
while others are far more visible,
like being accused of stealing a chair
from Angell Hall.
Sadly, modern racism has evolved
from explicit statements of loath-
ing and prejudice to gestures and
words coated with a layer of distrust-
ful scorn. As #BBUM has shown us,
many students can attest to facing
this subtle racism. Far more students
could attest to being complicit in
these acts, if only they were aware.
There are countless actions indi-
viduals commit every single day that
are deeply rooted in some kind of
racial bias, one that many of us prob-
ably don't even notice - whether it's
picking up your pace after you see a
group of Black men, or doubting the
legitimacy ofsomeone's opinion "just
because."You would be hard-pressed
to find a person - White, Black, His-
panic, or otherwise - who does not
have asingle racistbone in their body.
Society pumps racial biases into our
brains from the day we're born, and
this subconscious prejudice forces us
to make assumptions and decisions
contrary to the logical, anti-racist
positions most of us hold.
The first step to solving any prob-

lem is admitting that there is one.
While we, as individuals and as a
collective student body, must face
the fact that we all hold some unfair
prejudice, the University has its
own demons to face as well. College
should teach us how to lose the rac-
ism that's been programmed into us,
but instead it appears that many of
us make little real progress during
our time in school. If administrators
truly plan to take action toward race
relations, then they must fully come
to terms with the realities of our
campus. This would mean address-
ing the need for all of us to face our
inner biases, as well as an admission
they'll probably hate to make pub-
licly: The University is no longer a
racially diverse school.
Though this seems to be no secret
among the student body and several
faculty members I've spoken with,
the University itself still pushes the
image of a diverse campus on pro-
spective applicants, donors, and the
student body itself.
Since 2006 - the year Michigan
voters banned affirmative action
policies in public institutions - the
enrollment of underrepresented
minorities at the University dropped
some 30 percent. Combined, Blacks,
Hispanics and Native Americans
make up less than nine percent of all
students-at the University.
I hate to admit it, but my school
simply isn't diverse - and while say-
ing negative things about the Univer-
sity certainly won't help our image,
ignoring the truth will do far worse
damage to campus race relations.
Accepting our inherent preju-
dices and the woeful state of
diversity should not make us all
feel ashamed, but motivate us to
accept the challenge of defeating
these problems. So we all hold some
inner racism? Maybe instead of
our easy-to-fulfill race and ethnic-
ity requirement, we push students

to actively engage and fight their
inner biases through more rigor-
ous, soul-searching experiences
inside and outside of the classroom.
So our campus is no longer diverse
and race-based affirmative action
is off the table? Maybe we can fight
dropping minority enrollment by
instituting income-based affir-
mative action and focusing our
recruiting efforts on racially and
socially diverse areas like Detroit.
No, these ideas are not silver bul-
lets to improving race relations on
campus, but if the Board of Regents
and administration plan on keeping
their promise, they need to engage
the student body and translate their
intentions into actual policy. More
flowery statements about a need to
"create safe spaces" and "celebrate
diversity" to placate those who took
action in the #BBUM campaign
is simply an insult, and students
should not take administration
seriously until we see actual poli-
cies aimed at fighting racism.
At the end of the day, this is a
campaign to be led by students.
With the death of former South
African President Nelson Mandela
this weekend, we should be remind-
ed that no change happens without
action. We as students are not pow-
erless - the future of the University
is in our hands if we want it to be.
Our collective words atd actions
can determine exactly the direc-
tion our school takes if we set our
minds to a goal. A wildly success-
ful social media campaign has got-
ten a response from the University
and woken up students, faculty and
administrators to the realities of
racism and Black student life on
campus.
They're all listening very care-
fully - it's time to make a statement.

In an address to a graduating class of correc-
tions officers Friday, Snyder claimed that the
reduction of spending in the area of corrections
during the recession was unwise, and suggested
reform. "Too often, legislators, other leaders in
the state and the public look to corrections as a
place to cut back," Snyder said. Since Snyder took
office in 2011, the state has reduced corrections
spending by a quarter of a billion dollars - the
poor conditions of corrections facilities across
the state tell the consequences of the cut. Snyder
is calling for various upgradesto Michigan'spris-
on system, suggestingthe modernization ofsecu-
rity features and cameras along with investment
in improved mental health services for inmates.
The poor living conditions of the Livingston
County Jail reveal the larger issue of Michigan's
prison system. The female section of Livingston
County Jail has 31 beds, but averages more than
60 inmates on any particular day. In spite of this
issue, County Commissioner Ronald Van Houten
claims that the call for improvement is merely a'
"ploy," labeling the photograph of the females'
sleepingconditions as propaganda. The commis-
sioner's inability to consider the jail's conditions
and the rights and dignity of all residents is a
serious issue that speaks to a broader problem of
prison conditions being ignored by state officials
across Michigan.
The case in Livingston underlines many prob-

lems with the state's prison facilities. A report
from Prisoner Reform, an advocacy group, high-
lights the inadequate health services offered to
Michigan prisoners. Despite the massive bud-
get of Michigan's Department of Corrections,
the state's prisons lack adequate preventative
care. Furthermore, Michigan's prison sentences
are the longest in the country, and increasing
amounts of older people populating the prisons
adds pressure on the health needs of Michigan's
inmate population.
If Michigan wants to overhaul the prison sys-
tem as Snyder suggests, the state should reevalu-
ate its sentencing policies as well as the conditions
its prisoners are subjected to. Stricter sentencing
policies would decrease the number of inmates
filling the jail and requiring healthcare, relieving
the issues of overcrowding and neglected medi-
cal attention. Alongside more rigorous sentenc-
ing, offering parole hearings to those with life
sentenceswould reassess inmates who were sen-
tenced to life in prison as minors, making more
room for newly sentenced individuals.
It is clear that the living conditions of Michi-
gan's prisons are of very low quality and that this
issue should be taken seriously. Michigan must
upgrade various facets of its prisons and reassess
its sentencing guidelines, as Livingston County
Jail's situation simply calls outthe poor quality of
facilities across the state.

few months ago t was out
on a weeknight with my
group of friends. We were
at a bar that's
unprecedented
late-night happy
hour and chalk-
board walls have
lured us through
its . doors so.
often that we ;
refer to it as our
"Cheers." I was EMILY
perched on a bar PITTINOS
stool next to a
dude I'd known
since freshman year. We'd never
been very close, but our brains
were steeped in half-priced Bum-
percrop IPAs and as our gaggle of
friends flitted around the empty
bar scrawling "Red Rum" and
drawing pictures of genitalia on the
walls in chalk, we'd somehow tum-
bled into an easy and enthusiastic.
conversation. I'm not sure what we
were talking about - maybe our
lists of ex-lovers or our childhoods
in Michigan or the way pieces of
discarded gum meld with the side-
walk over time - but it doesn't mat-
ter. We were enjoying each other's
company and it felt good.
I sat facing the exit and when
my eyes wandered past the guy I
was chatting with, I saw a mutual
friend of ours slip on her coat by
the door. We made eye contact and
she immediately brought the "V" of
her fingers to her mouth and gar-
ishly wiggled her tongue between
them. She then brought her elbows
to her hips and gave the air a few
slow, sensual thrusts. With a wink
and a cigarette behind her ear, she
strolled out of the bar.
The guy didn't notice and we
went on talking about lead paint
or the history of rubber produc-
tion or whatever it was that fasci-
nated us at the time. However, the
conversation didh't feel as simple
as it did only moments before. I was

suddenly tainted by embarrass-
ment and scrutinizing every giggle
and smile. 'Wait, am I into him? Is
he picturing me naked right now?
Does he think this is going to hap-
pen? Is it obvious to everyone?'
I. quietly scanned the room and
realized we were being watched
by several of our friends, many of
whom gave us knowing smirks or
performed their own cunnilingual
gesticulations. Maybe I slipped into
enchantment with the guy before,
but I was shaken out of it once I
realized my peers' blatant sexual-
ization of the experience.
I wouldn't be surprised if any
of this sounds familiar to you. If
you've been to school between
the ages of 12 and 22, you've prob-
ably been the witness, recipient
or unknowing subject of "get-it-
in" gestures along these lines. I'll
admit it's a generally harmless and
common scenario, but it did make
me think about how much friends
tend to police each other's sex lives.
It seems like sex has become the
encouraged, and even expected,
result of two people spending any
time together at all. I can't tell you
how many times a friend has wit-
nessed me exchanging coy glances
with someone and almost immedi-
ately pulled me aside for an interro-
gation beginning with 'Is anything
happening between you? How's
the sex?' Questions about feelings
or potential for later dates aren't
asked until the sexual secrets are
spilled.
Of course,,like most other behav-
iors that peeve me, I'm just as guilty
of this as anyone else. Iknow this
interest often comes from a loving
place - we want our friends to be
happy and have endlessly fulfilling
love lives and all that - but these
good intentions can be eclipsed by a
selfish satisfaction. Despite the fact
that our culture is oversaturated
with sex, it's still a fundamentally
private and personal endeavor.

There is something delicious
about being privy to those intimate
details of a friend's life. It's invigo-
ratingtohearthe hilarious orsteamy
particulars of another person's sex
life. Plus, it can be personally vali-
dating to receive that information;
on some level, this divulgence con-
firms the closeness and trust you
have within a friendship.
But I think it's important that we
all examine these personal inter-
ests and recognize how our sexual
policing can negatively affect the
people we're "encouraging." Our
vulturous gazes can put a new
relationship into a sexual pres-
sure cooker and convince fledg-
ling couples to make moves before
they're ready. We can make things
awkward by projecting sexual ten-
sion onto truly platonic friend-
ships. And, most importantlyto me,
we can perpetuate the theory that
our generation places more signifi-
cance on sexual acts than meaning-
ful, personal connection between
humans.
As you've probablyheard else-
where, our generation is becoming
infamous for the invention of hook-
up culture and I believe sexual
policing is a side effect of this phe-
nomenon. We seem to care so much
about who's having sex with who
that we belittle the importance
of the potential emotions behind
these actions. Sure, we want every-
one to bone - it's fun and we're
young and why not use these hot
bodies while we've got them?
But we should also recognize
that the sexual pressures we place
on our friends can be unnecessary
and even uncomfortable. If people
want to have a sexual relationship,
they will. They don't need us wink-
ing or air-humping from the side-
lines in order to realize and act on
their own desires.

Merry Christmas,
Charlie Brown

It's a seasonal classic
for a whole lot
of reasons
t By BRIAN BURLAGE
Daily Arts Writer
Charlie Brown is a prepubes-
cent with a premature balding
complex. He suffers from pan-
phobia - the fear of everything -
despite havingbarely reached the
age of reason. His doghouse pessi-
mism eclipses every iotaof charm,
he perpetually mismatches the
same pair of pants and shoes and
he incubates an enormous, if not
offensive, disapproval of the holi-
day season. But Charlie Brown,
above all else, is an icon, a hero, an
underdog's underdog.
In 1965, executives from
Coca-Cola pitched an idea for
a Christmas special to CBS.
They demanded that Charles
M. Schulz's already classic Pea-
nuts cartoon be brought to life.
CBS turned to Lee Mendelson
("San Francisco Pageant") - who
would become the executive pro-
ducer of the show - and placed
the idea and the sponsorship in
his capable hands. Having been
given a pocket-sized budget and
only a few months to complete
the project, Mendelson drafted
animator-director Bill Melendez
("Here Comes Garfield") to begin
brainstorming the concept.
On Dec. 9, 1965, the half-hour
Christmas special that featured
Schulz's beloved characters aired
on CBS. As expected, the anima-
tion was choppy, the sound mixing
was far from quality and the dia-
logue was poorly enunciated. Pro-
duction had been rushed, as only
a handful of the studio employ-
ees managed the entire spot. The
executives weren't even confident
that Melendez and his team were
finished with the show. But 50
percent of all television sets in the
United States played the broadcast
that evening. Critics raved about
it. Commercial viewers fell in love
with it. Charlie Brown and com-
pany even made it to the cover of
TIME magazine later that year.
Every year since 1965, "A Char-
lie Brown Christmas" has aired
at least once - most of the time
twice - on either CBS or ABC dur-
ing the Christmas season. It won
an Emmy in 1966 for Outstanding
Children's Program and was sub-
sequently nominated, even in later
decades, for a Grammy (1978) and
a Satellite Award (2009). Popular
demand has called for the cre-
ation of Charlie Brown specials for
nearly every holiday: New Year's,
Easter, Fourth of July, Halloween
and Thanksgiving. Several spinoff
shows have since been made to
supplement the ever-increasing
international desire for the char-
acters.
"A Charlie Brown Christmas"
truly is a staple of the modern
Christmas holiday. Its endurance
is proven simply by the unfailing
demand for it to be aired, and by
the fact that major television net-
works have responded - and con-
tinue to respond - favorably to the
demand for nearly half a century.

And as indicated by ABC's recent
renewal of the Peanuts contract
through 2020, there are no signs of
this phenomenon stopping.
But what is it about the show
that has garnered such a fervent

love from its viewers? How could
a single half-hour program tran-
scend cultural delineation, pass so
easily from one generation to the
next and not taint its own legend?
Let's start with the production.
Mendelson and Melendez knew
from the show's inception that
children should and would domi-
nate the story. That's why when
the time came for them to employ
voice actors and fill the roles, they
looked no further than their pro-
spective audience. Every charac-
ter, from Charlie Brown to Linus to
Lucy, is voiced by a child. Some of
the voice actors, like Kathy Stein-
berg ("It's the Great Pumpkin,
Charlie Brown"), who played Sally,
were even too young to read and
had to be helped deliver half a line
at a time. True to their goal, Men-
delson and Melendez engineered
a children's cartoon comprised
entirely of children: Through the
show's 25-minute animation, not a
single adult makes an appearance.
Mendelson's riskiest move, per-
haps, was to hire jazz composer
Vince Guaraldi ("From All Sides")
for the show's music. Guaraldi,
who had been a long-time admirer
of the cartoon, agreed and pro-
duced the entire soundtrack with-
in a few weeks. The renowned
track "Linus and Lucy" - though
not specifically written as the
show's theme - quickly became
the special's, and the Peanuts fran-
chise's signature score. "Christ-
mas Time is Here" has expanded
from its Peanuts mold and since
become a seasonal classic. But
other tracks like "Skating" and "
Tannenbaum" mark the brilliance
of Guaraldi, who could capture the
insouciance and adolescent joy of
the characters. The soundtrack
remains a best seller and frequents
many greatest Christmas albums
lists (like Rolling Stone maga-
zine's).
But soundtrack and produc-
tion aside, it is Schulz's charac-
ters that have sustained the love
of their viewers for so long. It's
the endearing love/hate relation-
ship between Charlie Brown and
Lucy - secretly beggingto become
something more ambivalent, but
staying wishy-washy in spite of
it. It's the precocious empathy of
Linus, complemented both by his
wisdom and his attachment to his
little blue blanket, lending a well-
placed maturity of perspective to
the show. It's the man's-best-friend
dynamic casually portrayed by
Snoopy, who has too many tricks
and tonalities of his own to ever
really be a Charlie Brown subordi-
nate. Part ofwhatwe all love about
the show is that all of these charac-
ters, so unique and strange intheir
own ways, can come together to
celebrate the holiday and be com-
pletely happy.
Each of these aspects has con-
tributedtotheshow'slovablestory.
And while the show's plot might
not be particularly outstanding, it
ultimatelyisthegluethatholdsthe
entire production in order. Two
subplots develop simultaneously:
Snoopy's house decorating contest
(in which he wins first-place) and
Charlie Brown's struggle to find
the proper Christmas tree.
Early in the show, Charlie
Brown is tasked with finding an
appropriate tree for the school's
play. Ultimately, he is ridiculed by
his friends for his choice, and only

after a collective, heartfelt apology
for their act of callousness, does

his tree finally get spruced up and
fully appreciated.
For many viewers, the scene is
special because the audience real-
izes that Charlie Brown's diligence
was vindicated, and that he actu-
ally made the right choice. All the
children sing together around the
tree, and it's really a proper happy
ending to the program. Perhaps
what's less noticeable is Charlie
Brown's symbolic actof heroism.
Charlie Brown's tree, for him
at least, represents the true ideals
of Christmas: simplicity, tradi-
tion, virtue. Even his friends, who
are too preoccupied with other
things, insult him for adhering
to these values. And even though
they didn't realize it at first, as they
come to apologize and stand next
to Snoopy's first-prize doghouse,
they see that Charlie Brown's tree
holds a truer Christmas meaning.
So they take from Snoopy's beacon
of commercialism and add bit by
bit to the tree. And little old Char-
lie Brown, afraid of everything,
lacking any trace of hair or charm,
saves Christmas. Charlie Brown
the hero.

EVENT PREVIEW
Festival to screen
students' cinema

Still waiting for
Wonder Woman

SAC productions to
hit the big screen at
Lightworks
By GIANCARLO BUONOMO
DailyArts Writer
The semester is winding down,
and all around, students are fin-
ishing up their final projects.
For students in the Screen Arts
& Cultures Department, they
too have a final assignment, but
it will go beyond handing in a
paper to professors. This week-
end, the Film and Video Student
Association will host the bian-
nual Lightworks Student Film
Festival (FVSA), which screens
films produced by SAC students
in their production courses.
The SAC Department allows
students to produce films in
many different genres, which is
sure to lead to an eclectic line-
up for the film festival. To high-
light diversity, the FVSA doesn't
organize the films into blocks by
genre.
"In recent years, we've start-
ed to mix it up, so you'll have a
documentary, an animation and
a dramatic film in one block,"
said LSA senior and FVSA board
member Ross Warman.
Most of the films are shot
using digital video, except for
the experimental film course,
which still shoots on physical
film. Many directors and critics,
including Christopher Nolan of
"The Dark Knight," believe film
provides a quality that video
can't replicate.
"Technology is increasingly
closing that gap, but there's a lot
to be said for film. It definitely has
a specific quality to it - just the

amount of information you can
get on the actual, physical piece of
film is incredible," Warman said.
Be it on film or video, SAC
students have plenty of work to
show. There are around 12 pro-
duction courses each semester,
and each class is usually split
into groups, each of which makes
multiple films over the course of
the semester. SAC students might
produce upward of 60 films in
one semester, ranging from two-
minute animations to complete
television episodes.
SAC is a unique department
because, in addition to its cours-
es on film history and theory, it
allows its students to produce
creative work. Students might
start out making short films that
they and their group members
act in, but then progress to longer
and more complex films. The pin-
nacle of production is SAC 423,
where students studying direct-
ing, screenwriting and acting
all collaborate to make a 20- to
30-minute film with substantial
production values.
"Whenever we have those, it's
a big deal," Warman said. "It's
just a massive undertaking, and
they automatically go to the Tra-
verse City Film Festival; we've
got the only two reserved spots
in that."
SAC 423 produces profession-
al quality films because it allows
students concentrating in spe-
cific aspects of film to contribute
their specific expertise.
"The scripts for those are
taken from the screenwriting
sub-concentration, so that the
people who are at the highest
level of the screenwriting con-
centration have their scripts
turned into the highest level of
film production," Warman said.

In addition, the actors are
usually culled from the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance, and
production designers from the
Penny W. Stamps School of Art &
Design.
"It's great to have that cross-
college interaction," Warman
said.
SAC 423 is only offered in the
winter, so those films will only be
shown in next semester's Light-
works Festival. But 423 is not
the only course that produces
high quality cinema. In SAC 300,
students are still responsible for
writing the script, casting actors
and even raising money to fund
production costs. The results
are often beyond what one might
expect from student filmmakers.
Among many past projects,
there is a six-minute piece from
the fall of 2006 titled "Where's
Dinner?" This highly imagina-
tive, black-and-white film is best
described as a mash-up of "Alice
and Wonderland" and "I Love
Lucy." In it, a husband and wife
decide to roast a turkey, only to
have the (surprisingly nimble)
raw bird escape out of the back of
the oven, which is a portal to an
Eden-like garden. Other exam-
ples can be found on the FVSA's
YouTube channel.
Any works screened at the
Lightworks Festival are the
result of many hours of hard
work. Some students will spend
Saturday and Sunday shooting
for 12 hours and weeks editing.
While the SAC Department pro-
vides resources and training, it is
up to the students to produce the
films.
"I am always impressed by
how organized (everyone is), by
how much stuff they're willingto
put together," Warman said.

I can't remember the name
of the first comic I ever
read. It wasn't even mine.
All that comes to mind is a
tattered, sad excuse for a
paperback
- peel-
ing at the
edges, the
text frayed
to the point
of near-
illegibility. ItA
was beyond AKSHAY

barely held
together by
pieces of yellowing scotch tape
inside the spine to keep the
pages from drifting out.
When I climbed those
three metallic stairs onto the
unfamiliar yellow bus, terri-
fied of those unfamiliar faces
looking up, unblinking, from
those unfamiliar leather seats,
I didn't know I'd be meeting
a friend. When I sat down
next to him, he just smiled his
stupid smile. His hands were
clenched around the ragged
book, and when he offered it to
me, I stared.
Comic books disarm with
accessibility. The boxed panels
pull us in with their overbear-
ing displays of otherworldli-
ness, but we keep coming
back because there's comfort
in knowing someone as quiet
and unassuming as a geeky
high-school science nerd can so
forcibly change the world. Like
millions of others, I became
connected with Peter Parker.
No matter where I was in life,
I could bank on Pete still being
there, soldiering on behind
those tried ideals of responsibil-
ity and strength.
But part of the beauty of this
medium lies in its vastness -
there's a character for everyone,
and even if the stories follow a
similar framework, we tend to
identify with the personalities
we see traces of ourselves in.
For that reason, female protago-
nists, already lacking in a heav-
ily male-dominated superhero
universe, need to be given equal
footing.
Wonder Woman is a prime
example. In her 72 years, she
has become one of the most
recognizable, iconic feminist
symbols in pop culture. She has
her own series of comic books.
She has had her own popular
TV show. She has her own
themed plus-sized hoodies. So
why shouldn't she get her own
damn movie?
Well, she will. Kind of. Make
no mistake - Warner Bros.'
recent decision to include
Wonder Woman in the upcom-
ing "Superman vs. Batman"
extravaganza has its positives.
Including such a distinguish-
able female superhero is a
sign that studio executives are
finally willing to make moves
in the right direction, but this
recent announcement smacks of
money-grubbing impatience.

'M' takes on No. 3 Ferris State

meeting between the two Michi-

"He'd throw the gear on, and
I'd rip some pucks at him, just to

Monday.
Behind the junior goaltender
- who is 13-0-2 this season and
boasts a 2.23 career goals-against

present arguably the biggest
challenge of the nonconference
slate. Ferris State enters Yost rid-
ing a 13-game unbeaten streak
and now sits right behind the
Wolverines in the U.S. College
Hockey Organization rankings.
Still, it's a top-10 matchup few
could have predicted just months
ago.

point in the season, 4-1.
Though the stakes in Decem-
ber aren't nearly as high head-
ing into a two-week break before
the Great Lakes Invitational, this
game could end up holding just as
much weight.
"Ferris is huge," said senior
defenseman Mac Bennett on
Monday. "This game, come April
when the selection comes, who-
ever wins this game, it's going to
count for a lot We know that and
are prepared for that."
Last week, Michigan was
embarrassed at home in a 5-4
exhibition loss to the U.S. Nation-
al Team Development Program.
Though the loss had no reflection
on the record, it was the third
time in as many games that the
Wolverines allowed a seemingly
insurmountable lead to be erased
after backup goaltender Luke
Dwyer let in three late goals.

"We're past the exhibition,"
Bennett said.
To do that, Bennett said the
Wolverines will simply have to
"bear down" on chances even
when third-period fatigue sets
in. That starts with the defense.
Though the defense scored
its first two goals of the season
against Ohio State and the NDTP
- one by Bennett and the other
by freshman Michael Downing-
the unit has allowed 12 goals over
its last three games, forcing two
overtime contests.
"Up until the Ohio State week-
end (the defense) really hadn't
contributed the much, point-
scoring wise," Bennett said.
"Who knows, maybe we get
hot all of a sudden and we can
ride that, but as defensemen the
first thing we have to do is play
defense."
,Since the 1981-82 season, the

Wolverines and Bulldogs have
scheduled each other at least
twice a season - one time in
Ann Arbor, another in Big Rap-
ids. Michigan will take on the
Bulldogs just once this season,
breaking a streak that exceeds
Michigan coach Red Berenson's
tenure with the program.
"Ferris is the real deal," Beren-
son said. "It's a home game and
a nonconference game, but it's
against a team that's going to be
in the hunt at the end, it looks
like. You have to win these games
because it could have a big impact
at the end of the season."
Tyler said his dad bought over
100 tickets for in-state friends
and family to watch the brothers
duke it out in Yost on Wednesday.
It will be the first and only time
the season that there will be fans
at Yost cheering for both a Wol-
verine and a Bulldog.

With full week off, the Wolverines
prepare for No.1 Arizona on Saturday

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily SportsEditor
At this point last year, the
Michigan men's basketball team
had its eye squarely fixed on the
country's No. 1 ranking.
Now, with No. 1 Arizona com-
ing to Ann Arbor on Saturday for
a nationally televised game, the
Wolverines have a chance to sal-
vage what has been a rocky non-
conference slate.
The Wildcats represent the
first formidable opponent Michi-
gan will host in Crisler Cen-
ter this season, as it has rolled
through a set of cupcake games
thus far. But away-from-home
matchups have been a different
story. After a seven-point loss to
Iowa State, the Wolverines need-
ed a desperate comeback to beat
Florida State in Puerto Rico, and'
one night later, were stunned by
Charlotte.
A week later, the margin of
Duke's 10-point win over Michi-
gan was deceptively small.
For the unranked Wolverines,
hosting top-ranked Arizona
could wipe away some skepticism
Michigan fans have had.
Sophomore guard Nik Staus-
kas wasn't ready to label it
a make-or-break game, but
stressed how important the game
can be should the Wolverines
come out on top.
"I don't know if it's necessarily
a measuring-stick game because
I think we're capable of beat-
ing anyone when we play well,"
Stauskas said. "But as far as con-
fidence goes, to know that we can
get to that point - because we
know we haven't peaked yet - so
to get to that point where we can
beat good teams, it's going to be
key for us."
Last season's non-conference
schedule included only one true

The Wolverines had Sunday
off, and Monday and Tuesday
were scheduled -as "boot camp"
or "Michigan camp" - Beilein's
terms for the days focused on
his own team getting better as
opposed to preparing for an
opponent.
"Those first two days will be
all about trying to shore up what
we think our weaknesses," he
said.
One area Beilein stressed
was giving sophomore forward
Mitch McGary a bigger role in
the team's plans. McGary, who
has practiced just eight times
since practice began in October
because of a back condition, in
the three weeks, has been limited
thus far.
Michigan will then have a light

days hard and then play Arizo-

Arizona on Thursday and Friday.
"We're going to be all pumped

Stauskas said.

Wolverines attempt to.

'M' names two captains for the

By SHANNON LYNCH

After a productive offensive
victory against Virginia last

ball team is coming home to

games with-
put its leading
scorer, junior
forward Shannon Smith, who
averages 17.3 points per game.
In her absence, four players have
scored in double figures.
Coming back to Crisler Center
to finish out the year is a blessing
for the Wolverines, but a rigor-
ous four-game home stand will
be a different kind of challenge
for the team.
"It's been brutal and we threw
them right into the fire," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "Now they've really got to
focus on finishing strong in the
classroom as well as finishing
the year strong on the basketball
court."
Facing Eastern Michigan
in the "Battle of Washtenaw
County" poses no easy task for
the Wolverines. The undefeat-
ed Eagles are averaging 90.5
points per game and currently
rank fifth nationally in scor-
ing. Though Michigan leads the
series 12-8, Eastern Michigan
has won in three of the last four
meetings.
"They really push the bas-
ketball, they take a tremendous
amount of shots a game, they go
in transition, they're extremely
athletic," Barnes Arico said.
"They're playing exceptionally
well, and playing with a lot of
confidence."
On Wednesday night, the
Wolverines will need to focus
on decreasing their turnovers,

as she is now set to serve as cap- I think everyone takes on their

Dodge is serving as captain
for the first time this year. She
has been a standout since the
beginning of her freshman year,
quickly earning the respect of
her coaches and steadily play-
ing her way into the rotation.
As a sophomore, Dodge went
18-10 overall in singles. In dual
matches, she was able to peak at
the No. 6 singles spot and went
8-6. She now holds a career
record of 49-29 in singles.
Dodge is no . stranger to
exhibiting leadership. This past
summer, she made it a priority
to become a part of a passionate
coalition of current and former
college student-athletes called
Student-Athletes Leading Social
Change, where she participat-
ed in a week-long service trip
across the country.
Her invaluable experience
harnessed her leadership skills
and allowed her to gain consid-
erable insight into giving back to
those in need.
"One of my goals was to be
more of a leader this year,"
Dodge said. "I especially want-
ed to help the freshmen get
adjusted because when the team
is very close, it makes every-
thing easier, as if we're a family.
That's the best part of it all."

TERESA MATHEW/Daily
Junior forward Shannon Smith practiced at about 75 percent on Monday.

ing 26.7 points off turnovers per
game. Eastern Michigan also
leads the Mid-American Con-
ference in rebounds, averaging
18 offensive and 35.5 defensive
boards per game.
In Michigan's last game,
freshman guard Janay Morton
and senior guard Desyree Thom-
as led the team in points with 18
and 17, respectively.
Thomas is second in the MAC
in steals (3.2) and assist-to-turn-
over ratio (5.8) while ranking
third in field goal percentage
(55.9). Morton and two other
players in the Eagles lineup rank
in the top-12 in the MAC confer-
ence for scoring.
The lineup for Wednesday is
still questionable for the Wol-
verines. According to Barnes
Arico, Smith practiced at about a
75 percent level on Monday, but
is still in pain. Her return to the
court at Crisler this week is still
undetermined.
Senior forward Val Driscoll
has made strides in Smith's
absence, scoring a career-high
12 points in Virginia and going

6-for-6 from the field for Michi-
gan. But the Wolverines will
have to do more than just shoot,
turning up the pressure on
defense to keep the Eagles at bay.
One thing Barnes Arico won't
have to worry about is the mind-
set of her players. After fight-
ing for a close 64-62 loss to No.
15 LSU and earning two recent
wins, it's clear that the team has
bought into the mentality estab-
lished by the Michigan coaching
staff.
Michigan shot 53.8 percent
from the field against Virginia,
the third game of the season in
which the Wolverines shot over
50 percent.
Freshman guard Siera
Thompson and sophomore guard
Madison Ristovski moved the
ball around and combined for 17
of 21 assists in the game.
"There really isn't a superstar,
and no one really cares who gets
the credit," Barnes Arico said.
"They all want to make the extra
-pass and it shows up in the box
score. It shows up with easier
baskets and shot selection."

Holding hands
by Todd Needle

L ast March, I held a
boy's hand.
I held his hand
in broad daylight and we
walked straight through
the busiest part of cam-
pus. My heart beat faster
than I think it ever has
before and my palms
were sweating -which
was terribly embarrass-
ing. As he looked at me,
I whispered to him that
I had never held a boy's -
hand in public before. He
smiled and asked me if I
wanted to stop. And for a.
split second, I did. I igno-
miniously fumbled for g
my iPhone, pretending
that it had been vibrating
for the last few minutes.
I wanted to take the easy
way out and let go. But I
didn't. And here we are.,w
I've been holding my
father's hand since I was
a baby. My father's hand
was the hand I held onto when I've
"'felt the most lost in this world, and it's
the hand I wish I could hold onto now
as I write this. I haven't been able to
hold my father's hand in quite some
time because it seems like something
21 year-olds don't do. But I held Max's
hand that day. And I'm proud that I did.
I wouldn't change anything, because it
made me smile. Yet I felt like I owed it
to my father to hold his hand this time
and tell him who I really am. And I did.
And he smiled back at me.
That day in March, I apologized to
Max, butterflies still stirring like ner-
vous kindergartners in my stomach
long after we'd parted ways in front

of the Ross School of Business, and he
laughed at me. I was so worried that I
had offended him in some way, that my
journey toward self-acceptance was
somehow derailed by this one incident.
He told me not to worry, that we didn't
have to do anything I didn't want to do.
I sat in my room recalling the incident
and laughed nervously. Had I really
used my gruff, masculine voice when
I left him at the Business School? Was
that actually my defense mechanism?
My gravelly man-voice reserved for
frat parties? How fucking pathetic. I
was smiling through tears, because
somehow, this boy, in one day, and
in one head-turning (I expect it was
because he and I are so good-looking
and they're

School, and I wrestled with the fact
that I was holding his hand in public.
I wondered, and this was a question
my friends asked me later on, if I was
upset about the fact that we were hold-
ing hands, or upset about the fact that
it bothered me in the first place? That's
what made me so angry with myself -
it shouldn't have bothered me at all;
and after about half-an-hour of a slight
meltdown where I paced around my
room waiting for Max to respond to my
apology, I realized how important that
day was for me. I took a step toward
accepting myself both internally and
externally. I smiled the entire time we
walked together, despite my head spin-
ning out of control. I was also proud of
myself for being at least a little awk-
ward about it, because it meant I had
room to grow; still have room to grow.
Max is OK with that. I'm OK with that.
But Max didn't know that as com-
fortable as I was when I was around
him, and how happy he'd made me,
I still had one more hurdle to cross
before I could truly accept where I
was in my life. I had to tell my parents
about him.
I didn't know how it was going to go.
I didn't know if they were going to cry
or just shrug it off and say, "So?" like
I'd imagined for so long. The fact of
the matter is, as long as I'd known this
about myself, I'd never truly been able
to accept it and to take that next step of
sharing all of myself with my parents.

But I needed to do that
that day. I needed to tell
them who I am. I needed
to pick one of the sce-
narios I'd invented in my
head over and over and
go with it. Jay, one of my
close friends, told me
that if I just spoke from
the heart, the words
would come out right.
I think too much, but
maybe he's right. Maybe
-- I should just go for it
and see what happens, I
thought.
I couldn't shake this
feeling, though, that
they'd be disappointed.
My mom used to ask
me fairly often if I was
dating anybody. I'd get
overly-exasperated
every time she did and
I'd answer, "No, mom,
not right now ... " When
N MULHOLLAND we were in New York,
she made some comment
about how I was her last
hope of having grandchildren of her
three sons any time soon - as if our
other brother can't find a girl before
my mother turns 60. All I wanted her
to know is that it doesn't matter how I
do it, I'm going to be a father. I needed
her to know that. And I needed her to
know how much it hurt when she said
things like that, because I know that
it's never going to be exactly how she
pictured it.
Any of my best friends will attest
that I have nothing to hide. When I
*meet a boy, and I like him, and he likes
me, I tell them. They can tell when
I'm happy and when something good
is happening in my life. They ask me
if I like him, and I say yes. They ask if
he makes me smile, and I smile back
at them. They ask me if he's cute, and
I laugh at how awkward they are, but
really because they care so much. And
all they wanted to do was meet Max.

I'm not talking about the kind of
sex you see in movies with candle-

bed. I'm talking about the sex that

Skeeps - the sex that we all think
about, but are told not to talk about.
So let's chat.
High-school sex-ed can't com-
pete in the big leagues of the col-
lege hook-up culture. In 2007,
the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention reported that 47.8
percent of high-school students
had engaged in sexual intercourse.
The figure increases by almost 30
percent in college.
But most students
entering college are
not taught about the %
nitty-gritty of sex.
Thirty-seven states
require abstinence to
be covered in sexual
education, and of
those, 26 heavily
stress abstinence-

is what is expected.

you choose to go home with that

the party? What if you choose to
engage in sex with a partner, old or
new? What if your lifestyle doesn't
fit into the social norm that absti-
nence preaches to us? Then con-
doms are for you.
Condoms are approximately
98-percent effective in reducing
pregnancy and sexually transmit-
ted diseases. Of sexually active
college students, approximately
60 percent of respondents to The
Michigan Daily's unscientific
survey wear condoms regularly.
According to the sex survey, 93 per-
cent of students say they have worn
a condom at some point in their

sexual life - Go Blue! - while some have asked a sexual partner if they

for the hallway light to

"Brianne! Were you

"No, I -" -
She kissed me, thrust,

my face with tequila-

seem like nothing - a
blip within four years -
but, as a prisoner pinned
to a "New Girl" promo
poster, I'd been able to
reevaluate most of my
life: Am I dreaming? Is
this my college rite of
passage? Should I audition for the next
sequel to "American Pie?" Is Sean Wil-
liam Scott hiding in my closet? And, on a
metaphorical level: Am I, too?
I shook my head, tearing myself
from her clutches like a damsel in a bad
romance novella. "Wait," I said, laughing
- my natural response to uncomfortable
situations. "What are you doing?"
"C'mon," she whispered, grabbing
my wrist and leading me to the hallway,
where her boyfriend, amused, leaned
against the doorframe of her bedroom
with hands tucked into the pockets of
his flannel pajama pants. "Let's have a
threesome."
Of all the college brochures from

No, I thought, open
sexuality and hook-up

during which one can truly and self-

I ambled away into the hall, wrap-

means to "only live once." It was daring,
it was taboo and it was, most important-

Earlier that night, we'd crowded onto
the living-room loveseat - foreshadow-

to-hearts. What have you done? Where
have you done it? What do you want to
do? What would you be willing to do?
"Have you ever kissed a girl?" she
asked, leaning just close enough for me
to confuse her pheromones for the faint
perfume of weed, Patr6n and toothpaste.
Whatever; I was into it.
"I think once, during a game of Truth
or Dare. Have you?"
"No, I've been with Boyfriend since
we were like, 15. But I've always wanted
to try it, y'know?
"What about a threesome?" she con-

unused fake ID; the cultural epitome of
the does-her-homework, rational and
realistic "good girl" who sets her own
curfew and drink limit. What fun is
that?
Within our four-hour conversation,

fairy lights (atmosphere!), we'd estab-

The language of sexuality
by Sean Czarnecki

statement on the survey: Everyone has sex questions. We asked you what your latest sex search on Google entailed.

lat on the table lies the survey. An
array of sexual orientations are
., listed down its leftmost column.
In this column, both the well-known
sexualities inhabit the same space as
the lesser-known: "Heterosexual"
and "homosexual" are listed next to
"pansexual" and "questioning." There
are two sub-categories among this
assortment that may prove the most
thought provoking: "other identity" and
"unresolved."
The survey is the work of Michael
Woodford, an assistant professor of
the School of Social Work. He studies
people's experiences and interactions
with institutional climates, like students
on the University's campus.
Woodford said society wants to fit
people in boxes. "And sexuality is not
something that we can easily put people
in boxes, and they don't necessarily want
to stay in those boxes."
As we talk, he reads the list through
aqua-rimmed glasses. He takes the paper
and underlines one of the terms a student
used to describe themself, classified-by
the survey under "Other."
"For example, somebody wrote in
"Whatever' (as their sexual identity).
Well, what do you mean by that? OK,
is sexuality not important to you, how
you're defined?"
Another respondent calls themself
"Men Sexual." The concept of how
individuals coin their sexual identities
partly forms the core of Woodford's work
on campus. He hopes to understand
and validate the experiences of sexual
minorities.
"We need to give space for people to
identify those other categories," he said.
Woodford is out to break the "master
narratives." In the scientific'community
and mainstream at large, he believes
a biphobia - or aversion towards
bisexuality - lingers. It's a factor that
skews the conclusions of research in
order to create linear narratives of
sexuality, classifying people as strictly
heterosexual or homosexual. These
terms thoroughly fail, Woodford
believes, to capture the nuances of lived
experiences that exist outside sexual and
gender binaries.
. "Even theories of sexual minority
development say that people go through
these processes, where they may say,
'I think I might be gay, but really I'm
bisexual,' " Woodford said. "Then
eventually they come to a gay identity.
Well, those sort of master narratives are
being challenged."
Woodford cites Dan Savage's "It Gets

Better" campaign - a movement to
improve the self-esteem of lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender individuals
- as an example where spaces for more
unique sexual identities are not provided.
Gay identity still remains its focal issue.
In his own surveys, Woodford gives
students the option to write in their own
classification of their sexual orientation
if they do not identify with the list of
predetermined categories given.
"Topics of sexuality, like sexuality
itself, are so fluid and how people get
exposed to different identities - I think
that's evolving so quickly that we're not
exactly keeping on top of it," Woodford
said.
Despite the social pressure individuals
feel to fitnicely into place, Woodford said
sexual self-realization never crystallizes
for many people. Categories can provide
a useful way for people to locate their
sexuality, yet for othersthe terms narrow
the vastness of an experience.
LSA senior Taylor Portela, the
community engagement student lead of
the Spectrum Center - the University's
Office of LGBT affairs - faces such hard-
lined, sharp-edged social boxes each day.
Like Woodford, he fights a day-to-day
battle against social norms, only outside
the academic sphere. Sometimes, he even
wears his social protest visibly.
"I'll have my nails painted some days,
or I have this weird neon '90s coat, so
I get stares or cat-called on campus,"
Portela said. "I think part of my queer
identity makes me want to mess with the
categories and confuse people."
Such anxiety around gendered
categories runs common, according
to Mical DeGraaff, the professional
development coordinator at the
Spectrum Center.
"I think that's why people invent
words all the time," DeGraaff said. "I've
heard omnisexual, trisexual, question
mark - they just identify as question
mark - gender defiant, gender queer,
gender fluid. Because when you place a
label on something, it puts it into a box."
Portela fought through a slow, arduous
process in coming to his now-conceived
identity. For much of his youth, he never
devoted the time for self-discovery,
instead honing his academic skills or
participating in band and orchestra.
It wasn't until his senior year in high
school, after the death of a family friend
and the marriages of both his sisters,
that he forced himselfto think about his
identity. Today, he identifies as gay and
queer.
To be able to put an experience in

a word - to see it and to know its full
meaning - brings comfort to Portela. He
can now communicate his experience to
others and form a community. But his
journey forward in this overlap of two
different identities continues.
"There's comfort in what people are
discovering is the fluidity of (sexuality).
You don't have to be exclusively gay,
if you are, great, but you don't have to
be," Portela said. "It's like you're never
fully out, because sexuality really isn't a
visible thing. You perform it some days
and not others. It's always just more
conversations, more discussing and
talking about my identities to (other
people)."
Portela stands outside the political
scope ofwhatmaybe calledthe"majority"
agenda of the LGBTQ community. The
ways people would categorize him
concerns him, the use of the word "queer"
beinga particularly contentious issue.
"'Queer' is used now as this umbrella
term for everyone inthe LGBT spectrum,"
he said. "I think it kind of depoliticizes it,
like there's no meaning to it. 'Queer' is
supposed to have a destabilizing effect in
spaces."
Like those students in Woodford's
survey, DeGraaff formed her own
personal definition of the term queer. She
also acknowledges that queer is a loaded
term that many still haven't reclaimed,
but it's simply the best she has right now.
"(Queer) doesn't assume anything
about me," she said. "It doesn't assume
anything about my partners. It doesn't
assume anything about their identities
or my identities or the fluidity I see in
identities. It allows me a lot more space to
be the way that I feel that day."
Before arriving at that identity, she
came out as bisexual in high school. Her
experiences in college, however, invoked
certain connotations that made her
uncomfortable.
"There's a certain level of expectation
that goes with identifying as bisexual as
a White, fairly attractive female co-ed
college student that I wasn't comfortable
with," she said. "Specifically from men,-
it was like, 'Make out with this chick so
I can watch you. It was just a word; it was
just the best I had at the time."
Then, she identified as pansexual -
which came with constantly explaining
the term.
"At some point I kind of gave up and
just landed on 'queer' because it was just
the easiest thing for me to use."
The connotations inherently bound
to words are irksome for those coming
into their sexual identity. DeGraaff used

the term 'gynosexual' as an example,
which describes someone with sexual
feelings towards women. Where some
heterosexuals identify as gynosexual
to stand in solidarity with the LGBTQ
community, she believes others use it to
escape their privilege as heterosexual.
Portela also remains wary of the
creation of more categories to describe
people's sexual experience. It worries
him that we're "pathologizing" sexuality.
Still, he relents that people can
identify as they will. He notes his own
experiences when he first started work
at the Spectrum Center and encountered
sexual identities unknown to him.
"I thought it was awesome that there
were words to describe people's lived
experiences," Portela said. "But then it's
also strange still just because you don't
really know what they mean or how
they're used."
Anxiety over labeling may cause
people facing the traditional, rigid
binaries of gender and sexuality to carve
out new spaces ontthe sexual spectrum
more to their fitting. Though helpful
in understanding experience, Portela
believes labels can "restrict and constrict
the world."
This is evident in the individualized
categories seen in Woodford's survey.
Another respondent's write-in, "Men
Sexual," made him wonder whether
the category "gay" feels foreign or
problematic to that person.
"One of the problems we sometimes
have is that people identify as some
unique category," Woodford said. "And
there's just not enough people identifying
as that category to be able to do any kind
of analysis. It becomes a struggle."
By continuing his research, Woodford
hopes to advance the conversation
further into the sexual unknown.
As for Portela, he's still figuring out
what it means exactly to be gay or queer.
Not everyone is fluid in their sexuality,
but he is. People always change,
he believes, so too will the ways he
experiences desire.
"These are questions about ourselves
that can't really be answered. The
answer is life itself and continuing to
live," Portela said, beginning to laugh.
"And so I'll know what everything means
as it comes at me, I guess."
Woodford looks at his list. He points
at different sexual orientations listed
by respondents. He underlines those
he does not yet know, but endeavors to
understand. The list grows, it seems, with
each new question, each untold story in
the form of a moniker - an identity.
