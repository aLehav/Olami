RACE ON CAMPUS
After 4BBUM,
regents vow to
take action on
race relations


Administrators voice
support for students
of color at meeting
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily Staff Reporter
While #BBUM trended nationally
on Twitter, its message reached the
University's Board of Regents. The
board heard Thursday heard from
student leaders and administrators
about the campaign and offered a
glimpse at how they might respond.
The Being Black at the Univer-
sity of Michigan campaign gained
momentum Tuesday as students
took to Twitter to share their expe-
rience and thoughts about what it
means to be Black at the University
- both good and bad. Over the past
two days, #BBUM - created by the
Black Student Union - has been used
more than 16,000 times and spread
far beyond the confines of campus.
National figures have responded in
solidarity with the students and the
hashtag has inspired a similar move-
ment at Michigan State University,
#BBMSU.
Although some administrators
have already responded to the move-
ment on Twitter, the meeting marked
the first time the officials addressed

the campaign in person. The offi-
cial University Twitter account ini-
tially responded on Tuesday, saying
administrators are listening.
During her monthly report on the
Division of Student Life, E. Royster
Harper, the division's vice president,
said the administration is working to
address the issues brought up by the
campaign.
"It's quite an informative and
robustcand honest and painful conver-
sation among the community about
the experiences of African-American
students," Harper said.
Earlier in the meeting, Physics
Prof. Timothy McKay gave a presen-
tation on predicting student success
at the University. The presentation
included statistics demonstrating
that students in less supportive envi-
ronments tended to not perform to
the best to their academic abilities
academically. Many of the students
who contributed to the BBUM dis-
cussion said they often felt isolated
in their classes and with their non-
Black peers.
Harper, who said she was struck
by the presentation's findings, said
the administration will work toward
improving the University's focus on
celebrating diversity - "the com-
mitment that this institution has and
will continue to have."

Dining optionstocag

University
expands Dining
Dollars, makes
meals unlimited
By CAROLYN GEARIG
Daily Staff Reporter
After encouraging students
to waste less food in the new
trayless initiative, Univer-
sity Housing is implementing
unlimited meals with all meal
plans.
For the 2014 academic year,

all plans will include unlim-
ited meals, a certain amount
of Dining Dollars and no Blue
Bucks for students living in
residence halls and North-
wood III Apartments. Blue
Bucks will be available for
purchase but will not auto-
matically come with any plan.
The unlimited plan will be
included in students' room
and board rates. The new
offerings also include several
different options to balance
Dining Dollars and guest
meals.
The Bronze Plan comes at
no extra cost and will include

25 Dining Dollars and two
guest meals. The Silver Plan
costs an extra $175 per semes-
ter, and will include 200 Din-
ing Dollars and eight guest
meals. The Gold Plan costs an
extra $275 per term, and will
include 300 Dining Dollars
and 12 guest meals.
Christine Siegel, senior
associate director of hous-
ing services, said University
Housing has been studying
the design of new plans for
over a year.
"We want students to feel
comfortable that they can eat
as often as they like in the din-

ing hail," Siegel wrote in an
e-mail. "We are hoping that
the plans will encourage stu-
dents to use our dining facili-
ties as hubs for socializing and
studying."
Currently, a 125- or 150-
block meal plan comes at no
extra cost with room and
board rates. The 125 plan
includes 125 meals, 300 Din-
ing Dollars and 75 Blue Bucks,
while the 150-block plan
includes 150 meals, 100 Dining
Dollars and 100 Blue Bucks.

In response to the recent slew of
letters from department chairs con-

University administrators apolo-

Thursday about the lack of commu-

which is expected to cut costs by $5
to 6 million by consolidating human-

executive vice president and chief
financial officer, sent an e-mail to fac-

factual errors and clarifying the Uni-

the consulting firm contracted for the
project. The Accenture contract is val-

Simulations could
help young adults
with disabilities
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily StaffReporter
At the intersection of video
games and medicine lies a
new University initiative to
construct a center for the
development of medical tech-
nology.
The U.S. Department of
Education's National Institute
on Disability and Rehabilita-
tion Research recently award-
ed a $4.5 million, five year
grant to a team of collabora-
tive researchers from multiple
disciplines and departments
across the University. This
grant will fund researching
therapies for adolescents and
young adults with physical,
cognitive and neurodevelop-
mental disabilities.
Michelle Meade, an assis-
tant professor in the Medi-
cal School's Department of
Physical Medicine and Reha-
bilitation, said the project -
called Technology Increasing
Knowledge, Technology Opti-
mizing Choices - will likely
spawn a new research center
at the University, tentatively
named the Center for Self
Management and Rehabilita-
tion Technology.
Such a center would aim to
supply practical therapies to
improve the lives of patients
with debilitating physical

impairments. Among other
projects, this includes the
development of rehabilitation
video games intended to pro-
vide patients with support in
their daily lives, Meade said.
"No matter what level of
injury someone has, there is a
capacity for that individual to
have a happy, productive life,"
Meade said. "How people do
that often depends on their
personality and the resources
they have available."
One resource that Meade
and collaborators are develop-
ing is SCI-Hard, a computer
game that engages the patient
in simulations of common
daily struggles they may face
at home. By solving prob-
lems and developing strate-
gies to win the game, patients
simultaneously develop tools
that help them in the outside
world.
"That game is focused on
teaching self-management
skills - the attitude that peo-
ple with spinal cord injury can
and should be able to get out
and manage their health and,
once they're able to do that,
take on all the other challeng-
es that life throws at them,"
Meade said.
The grant is also funding
the development of a "virtual
coaching" application that
will track the body move-
ments of patients with limited
mobility and provide them
with feedback from a health
professional. Meade said
researchers hope the app can

Men discuss
healing after
sexual assaultw
By JACK TURMAN
For the Daily
While many events regard-
ing sexual abuse are guided
toward raising awareness for
female survivors, an event held
Thursday night aimed to raise
awareness, show support and
explain available resources for
male survivors of sexual abuse.
The event, entitled Dare to
Dream, was co-sponsored by
the Central Student Govern-
ment and the Rackham Dean's
Strategic Initiative Grant. The

event emphasized that healing
is possible for male survivors.
The event started with a
viewing of the documentary
"Boys and Men Healing,"
which tells the story of three
male survivors and how their
abuse impacted their recovery
process.
After the documentary,
Chris Anderson, executive
director of MaleSurvivor, and
Jim Struve, one of the non-
profit's original founders,
facilitated a panel discussion.
MaleSurvivor is a national
organization that supports
male victims of sexual abuse.
Rackham student Ben Alter-
man coordinated the event
with help from MaleSurvivor
and many other University

and local organizations.
Currently, one in six males
are sexually abused before the
age of18 and one of every eight
adult rape victims are male,
according to Anderson and
Struve. According to Alter-
man, 3,584 out of 7,446 sexual
abuse survivors at the Univer-
sity of Michigan are male.
Alterman, Anderson and
Struve are survivors of male
sexual abuse and believe that
the first step toward recov-
ery is reaching out to people.
While this may not seem hard
in theory, Anderson described
that social stereotypes are
huge barriers toward reaching
out.
Struve explained that soci-

described that social stereotypes

Struve explained that soci-
etal myths, such as the idea that
male survivors are gay or weak,
have hindered survivors reaching
out. Struve believes that social
stigmas associated with sexual
abuse have caused men to think
that they can hide their traumatic
experience and can recover on
their own.
"The definition of masculin-
ity in our culture really creates a
strong disincentive for any man
to come forward and to say that
he has been victimized," Ander-
son said.
While Alterman, Anderson
and Struveahave extensively
researched and discussed this
topic, many students who attend-
ed the event were shocked about
the stories and statistics dis-
cussed. Rackham student Mal-
lory Fuhst described that this
event expanded her perspective
of sexual abuse.

Hundreds of environmental

they were deeply disappointed by

Wearing "Polluters talk, we

countries were arguing over who
should do what to fight global

The two-week session in the

In his monthly report to the
board, CSG President Michael
Proppe, a Business senior,
stressed the importance of
swiftly addressing the issues
raised by the campaign. While
briefing the board on #BBUM,
Proppe acknowledged the
movement brings to light an
experience that the majority
of University students do not
have.
"This is not an experience
that I will ever have," he said.
"It is not an experience that 95
percent of our student popula-
tion will ever have."
The University's enroll-
ment of Black undergraduates
dropped from about 7 percent
in 2006 to 4.65 percent in 2013.
In 2006, Michigan vot-
ers approved Proposal 2, a
ban on affirmative action in
higher education. Although
the University has worked to
create alternate recruitment
programs for underrepresent-
ed minorities, the programs
have not been able to stanch
the decline in Black and Native
American enrollment. His-
panic enrollment has fallen as
a percentage of the overall stu-
dent body but remained fairly
constant in terms of absolute
numbers since the student
population has grown overall.

dents, faculty or staff. The use
of Blue Bucks will be expanded
to items other than food, such
as books and equipment rent-
als.
Currently, Dining Dollars
can be used only at residential
dining halls, cafes and conve-
nience stores. Blue Bucks are
accepted in those places as well
as at University Unions, athlet-
ic stadiums, library cafes, laun-
dry rooms and dozens of other
on-campus locations.
Logan said feedback from
the Residence Hall Association

and members of the University
Housing Student Advisory and
Input Group was considered in
the process of developing the
new meal plans.

Relations. Since eligible class-
es for the requirement must
be at least three credits, the
two-credit IGR classes do not
currently qualify to fulfill the
requirement.
IGR courses are intimate,
student-driven classes that dis-
cuss gender, race and ethnicity,
socioeconomic status, religion

other culturally relevant top-
ics.
Proppe added that the Uni-
versity should continue to lis-
ten to students, as they have on
thegeneral-admission policy
for football games, the Munger
Residence Hall and the presi-
dential search advisory com-
mittee - to gauge student
voice and concern about diver-
sity and related topics. Proppe
added that he looks forward to
working with the board to find
real solutions.
"Students are tired of talk-
ing; students want to see some
action," Proppe said.
On behalf of the board,
Regent Denise Ilitch (D) said
the administration is work-
ing on programs to better
approach problems facing
diversity on campus.
Although Ilitch said the pro-
cess ofimplementing programs
may take a while, she said the
board shares the same passion
to solving the problems as the
students.
"We're as frustrated as the
students, but we're very com-
mitted to these topics," Ilitch
said.
The next meeting of the
Board of Regents is scheduled
for Dec. 19.

cially in light of the dining
renovations and new options
that will be available at South

"Student surveys over several
years indicated that these plans
result in the highest levels of
satisfaction."
Logan added that he has
been in contact with other
universities across the country
to discuss students' meal plan
preferences - with unlimited
meal plans largely preferred.
Engineering sophomore
Matt Chudoba, who currently
lives in Bursley Residence Hall,
said he supports the unlimited
meal plans. As a freshman liv-
ingin Mary Markley Residence
Hall, Chudoba said the 125-
block meal plan provided more
than enough Dining Dollars,
Blue Bucks and meals, but the
same plan is not as effective in
Bursley.
However, LSA sophomore
Kaia Parenti thought the
unlimited meal plans will be
unnecessary for some. With
her 150-block meal plan, she
has only used two-thirds of her
meals, and spends Dining Dol-
lars and Blue Bucks a couple of
times a week.
While Parenti said she will
purchase a Silver or Gold Plan
next year to save money, she
said she thinks a plan with
fewer meals and more Din-
ing Dollars would be a better
option for some.

"It really depends on where
I'm living but I think overall, I
wish I could get more Dining
Dollars," she said. "Twenty-
five is nothing. It's going to last
me two weeks."

ees with deep expertise are man-

Additionally, since Rowan
Miranda, associate vice president
for finance, previously worked for
Accenture, Slottow said Miranda
took himself out of the selection
process "to eliminate any pos-
sibility of real or perceived bias."
The report had accused Miranda
of a conflict of interest because
of the involvement of his former
employer in the Shared Service
Center's creation.
Addressing concerns that
lower-income women were par-
ticularly burdened as part of the

transitional staff, the statement
said that planned Shared Service
Center staff shares similar demo-
graphics with the rest of the Uni-
versity's staff positions.
Three separate forums led by
Laurita Thomas, associate vice
president for human resources,
were held during the week to pro-
vide more detailed information
about the center's organization
and transition process. The cur-
rent structure of the center will
feature six functional lead posi-
tions and about 20 other leader
roles.
Interim LSA Dean Susan
Gelman reiterated in an e-mail
interview that there will be no
layoffsin the transitional pro-
cess and voiced her support for
staff members' moving to the
center.
"In my view, this was the most
urgent of all the concerns that
have been raised regarding AST,
and it is tremendously reassur-
ing that our staff will continue to
have a place within the univer-
sity," she wrote.

Friday, November 22, 2013 - 3
During the public comment
portion of Thursday's Board of
Regents meeting, two faculty
members and one graduate stu-
dent expressed concerns about
the Shared Services Center.
Women's Studies Prof. Celeste
Brusati, Rackham student Eliza-
beth Walker and Women's Studies
Prof. Maria Cotera all touched on
similar points. Their comments
were mostly concerned with the
possible dehumanization of fac-
ulty members and lack of commu-
nication and interaction between
faculty and students.
In her address to the regents,
Walker said she chose the Uni-
versity's graduate program over
other competitive higher educa-
tion institutions because of the
interactions she had with staff on
campus when she visited.
"I want you to realize that by
doing this program you'll be tak-
ing something vital from my edu-
cation," Walker said. "There is no
possible way the staff could con-
tinue their level of service in a dif-
ferent location."

Kony has reportedly been in
talks with Kenyan president

Subject of massive
manhunt believed to
be in the southeast
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - Central
African Republic's government
said Thursday that Joseph Kony,
anaccusedwarcriminalhuntedby
African troops and U.S. advisers,
is believed to be in the country's
remote southeast and has been
talking with the president. U.S.
officials and others expressed
doubt the reported talks represent
a breakthrough in efforts to bring
himto justice.
Kony, who has been indicted on
charges of crimes againsthumani-
ty, has evaded capture for decades
and was the subject of viral video
seen by more than 100 million
people last year produced by the
advocacy group Invisible Chil-
dren. His fighters with the Lord's
Resistance Army are known for
hacking off the lips and ears of
their victims, and turning young
girls into sex slaves.
Reports over the years have
claimed that the brutal jungle
gangster was hiding in Sudan's
Darfur region or in a remote
corner of volatile Central Afri-
can Republic, where LRA fight-
ers have killed at least 33 people
since January and abducted
more than 100 others.
Central African Republic
government spokesman Gaston
Mackouzangba said Thursday
that Kony is now believed to be
in the town of Nzako. None of
the groups searching for Kony

reported any indication that
Kony was really there.
"The president said he had
spoken by telephone with Joseph
Kony who wants to lay down his
arms," Mackouzangba told The
Associated Press. "The negotia-
tions are ongoing."
The government also said it
had sent medicine to Kony at
his request. The African Union
envoy in charge of pursuing the
LRA said Wednesday that many
reports indicate Kony is seriously
ill.
The State Department said
Thursday that U.S. authorities
are aware that CAR officials
have been in contact "for several
months" with a small LRA group
"that has expressed interest in
surrendering." The U.S. said
it's clear the LRA is facing sig-
nificant pressure from African
military forces hunting for LRA
fighters and Kony.
"At this time, we have little
reason to believe that Joseph
Kony is part of this group," the
State Department said, adding
that Kony and his senior com-
manders have used "any and
every pretext to rest, regroup,
and rearm, ultimately returning
to kidnapping, killing, displacing
and otherwise abusing civilian
populations."
The Resolve, a U.S. aid group
that carries out anti-LRA work,
said the report of talks with Kony
is based on a series of engage-
ments between an LRA group
near Nzako and local authori-
ties. A few mid-level LRA lead-
ers say they are interested in

settling peacefully in the area,
said spokesman Michael Poffen-
berger.
"They have referred to
involvement from 'the big boss'
but there has been no evidence
of actual involvement from Kony
in this process. On the contrary,
there is some indication that the
group may be acting independent
of his direction," said Poffen-
berger, whose group helps run
the LRA Crisis Tracker, a website
that charts LRA attacks.
The spokesman for Uganda's
military also said Thursday that
he's pessimistic that the reported
contact with Kony or his fight-
ers will bear fruit. Lt. Col. Paddy
Ankunda said Uganda supports
in principle any initiative by Cen-
tral African Republic to engage
in talks with Kony, but he noted
that it's the third time there have
been reports of such efforts.
Uganda has about 2,500
troops working to find Kony in
CAR and the surroundingregion,
Ankunda said. The U.S. also has
about 100 special forces sta-
tioned across central Africa who
are helping advise in the hunt for
Kony.
Uganda's military is the prin-
cipal player in the multi-coun-
try hunt for Kony, who kidnaps
men, women and children, forc-
ing some to become fighters and
others to become sex slaves.
The LRA, which originated in
Uganda in the 1980s as a popu-
lar tribal uprising against the
government, has waged one of
Africa's longest and most brutal
rebellions.

that social-stigmas associated

Re-evaluating R&E requirement
The University should require a freshman class on identity issues
n Tuesday, the Black Student Union organized a "Being Black at the
University of Michigan" campaign both on social media and Uni-
versity spaces; where Black students were encouraged to tweet and
share their experiences of being Black at the University. The #BBUM cam-
paign is just one of many student movements to point to declining minority
enrollment and a lack of support from University administration as instru-
mental in creating a hostile racial climate. Since Michigan is devoted to
promoting and nurturing a diverse institution, the administration should
demonstrate this commitment by requiring all freshmen to take a course
concerning contemporary identity issues.

thing is, in researchingthe U.S.
embargo on Cuba for a term paper,
I've become convinced that the
outdated policy is not only irratio-
nal but also a clear example of the
inherent dangers in both electoral
politics and our lingering Cold War
mentality. I've grown increasingly
aware that while the embargo may
have little impact on the average
American - aside from depriving
us of the world's finest cigars - its
continued implementation has had
major repercussions for the health
and well-being of the Cuban people.
For the past five decades, the Unit-
ed States has imposed an economic,
commercial and financial embargo
on the nation of Cuba. The embar-
go comprises thousands of laws,
including strict travel restrictions
and U.S. Treasury-enforced penal-
ties on international banks' doing
business with Cuba - all intended to
topple Castro's longstandingcommu-
nist regime. As 50 years have passed
and Castro's government remains in
power, it's clear that the embargo has
been unsuccessful in itsstated intent.
And yet the policy persists.
The nature and aim of the embar-
go have changed considerably since
the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Once a Soviet-allied nation only 90
miles off the coast of Florida, Cuba
can no longer be seen as the major
threat it once was. The embargo,

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

Surely by now everyone has heard of the
blog Return of Kings and their recent
post, "5 Reasons to Date a Girl with an
Eating Disorder." This dis-
gusting, demoralizing and
disturbing article has right-
fully caused an uproar from
allies and opponents alike,
all while gaining massive
traffic on their website.
The thesis of the article
is exactly what it purports MAURA
to be - no sarcasm includ- LEVINE
ed. These men genuinely
want, "to usher the return
of the masculine man in a
world where masculinity is being increasingly
punished and shamed in favor of creating an
androgynous and politically-correct society
that allows women to assert superiority and
control over men."
As laughable as this sounds, these misogynists
aren't kidding. In fact, due to their previously low
website traffic, they engineered the article about
the positivity behind female eating disorders in
order to generate a wild controversy and thusget
their name out in the press. Websites and blogs
such as Return of Kings and Total Frat Move are
notorious forthiskindofbehavior. People should
combat their attention-seeking actions by ignor-
ing their taunting and lurid posts.
When being teased as a child, we were always
told that people would keep teasing you if they
could get a rise out of you. That is basically what
these websites are doing. While they do prob-
ably believe the heinous words they publish, they
also write to further their cause. By replying to
them, in agreement or vehement protest, you are
promoting them. According to the International
Business Times, the eating disorder article is an
offensive attempt at "trolling the Web" to raise
the profile of Return of Kings and to profit off of
the ensuing controversy. As more and more peo-
ple flood the website after their friends post the
link to Facebook, Twitter and other social media
outlets, the website is gaining popularity from all
the hits. It has gone viral - doing exactly what
the nastycreatorswanted.
Along the same lines, as Dean Obeidallah
beautifully opined for CNN last weekend, by
doing outrageous and attention-seeking actions,
the highly publicized Miley Cyrus has achieved

exactly what she always wanted: fame. By
writing more articles about her and her
bizarre actions (and even by mentioning her
here) we are only encouraging and perpetuat-
ing her extreme behavior and fame. The more
weird stuff she does on TV, the more her name
is spoken, the more fame she has and the more
money she rakes in.
This same principle applies to Return ofKings
and itsbrother website, TFM. The obnoxious and
infuriating articles, which often promote treat-
ing college women as nothing more than mere
sex objects,have made TFM one of the most pop-
ular websites for college men. By giving specific
examples of TFM articles here, I would only be
perpetuating the sick culture these misogynistic
men have easily created through use of the quick
and accessible Internet.
While others maysaythatthese websites are
"all in good fun" or are untouchable because of
freedom of speech, it does not change the fact
that their backwardness is harmingsociety. By
constantly gaining popularity for talking about
women negatively, some part of their mentality
seeps into society's consciousness. It promotes
not only gender inequality but also rape cul-
ture through its constant treatment of women
as mere objects. Whether or not these articles
should be taken as a joke, they have gained
popularity and are encouraging a sick, compla-
cent group of college-aged men who think that
just because someone on TFM posted about it,
it is OK to act that way.
While these websites are going viral and spi-
raling out of control, with positive or negative
comments, you can stop their prominence by
not posting links to them. Truly ignoring these
websites would stop them in their tracks. This is
not a request to stop caring about the issues they
bringup, because open dialogue is important, but
this is a request to stop funding their ignorance.
By replying to them and showing all your friends
their links, all you are doing is adding to their
growing popularity. There are other, more posi-
tive and helpful arenas where issues of misogyny
and inequality can be discussed without spon-
soring the instigators at their core. Join me in
silently protesting the Internet-monster-men
who are instigatinguproar for money.

In battle of wills,
Wolverines try to prove
toughness against Iowa

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
Iowa's Kinnick Stadium is
notorious for being a destination
of disarray for visiting teams.
For one, the away locker room
is painted pink,

not just their

the names of their parents and
siblings, according to fifth-year
" senior left tackle Taylor Lewan.
To top it off, the forecast in
Iowa City calls for a cool 25
degrees on Saturday.
So it's not surprising the Wol-
verines (3-3 Big Ten, 7-3 overall)
keep throwing around the word
"tough," when describing the
challenge they face this week-
end, their penultimate game of
the regular season.
But Michigan plans to counter
Iowa's toughness with its own,

in a contest Lewan dubbed as a
battle of wills. And with redshirt
junior quarterback Devin Gard-
ner leading the way, Michigan
sees that as a very achievable
goal.
On Monday, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke called Gardner a
"fighter." Lewan said he was sur-
prised by the tenacity the quarter-
back showed last weekend against
Northwestern, especially the way
he rallied in the third overtime to
score the game-winning touch-
down and two-point conversion.
"I knew Devin was tough,"
Lewan said. "I didn'tknowhe was
that tough. Obviously we don't
want him to get sacked the rest of
the season, but if he does, I know
he's going to get up every time.
That speaks volumes about him
as a leader, as a quarterback, as a
person."
Against the Wildcats, Michi-
gan had to call a timeout when
Gardner temporarily lost feeling
in his left arm. Despite that, Gard-
ner says he's feeling the healthiest
he has in weeks.
"I always thought of myself
as a pretty tough guy," Gardner
said. "The competitive juice that I
have, that helps me fight through
some pain if I'm a little beat up."
Gardner's hits may not be
behind him, though. In fact, he
might well be staring them dead

in the face again come Saturday.
Hoke said that Iowa is much
improved from last season, espe-
cially on defense. Its linebackers
mostly consist of seniors now,
giving the Hawkeyes confidence
to blitz more frequently.
As for the rest the rest of their
offense, the Wolverines expect to
have a more established, balanced
ground game this weekend.
Fifth-year senior running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint didn't play
in last week's game, due to miss-
ing practices from a concussion.
In his place, freshmen Der-
rick Green and De'Veon Smith
handled most of the carries. But
with Toussaint slated to return,
Hoke said Wednesday that he
has divided the snaps in practice
into thirds.
Saturday is by no means a
marquee matchup, with both
teams in the bottom half of the
Legends Division. But in a year
where little else except a 10-win
season can be gained, Gardner is
anxious to prove that last week's
overtime win wasn't a fluke.
"I always knew I was the ulti-
mate competitor," Gardner said.
"That's what really drives me.
Becoming so close to my team-
mates, that really helps. You're
not only fighting for yourself, but
you're fighting for your team-
mates, your brothers."

Freshman running hack Derrick Green could wake his second consecutive start against Iowa on Saturday.

Gibby's coaching works is that it's
a rather developmental program.
Once you have a few years of

After the Wolverines took
home their first outright regional
title since 1997, the celebration
period was brief. Gibby praised
his runners and talked about how
pleased he was with the program.
With nationals a week away, one
could hardly blame him for quick-
ly turning his thoughts to Terre
Haute, Ind., where his team is
poised for its best finish in years.
But his excitement didn't seem
to match the accomplishment.
That's because Gibby is a Michi-
gan coach, and the Wolverines
didn't win the Big Ten this year.
"We measure our success by
three championships,"Gibby said.
"The Big Ten, the regional and the
NCAA meet, they're all pretty
equal. But the regional is definite-
ly third on the list of three."
Gibby values the regional title.
He knows it's a barometer for the
team's progress. He knows that, at
that meet, he beat Indiana - the
only team that kept the Wolver-
ines from the Big Ten title - and
perennial powerhouse Wiscon-
sin. But he certainly doesn't hold
being a Great Lakes Regional
champion in as high regard as he
does being a Big Ten or National
champion.
"We like to think we have
bigger and better things in our
future," Gibby said. "And I think
we have the personnel to accom-
plish that."
On Saturday, both teams will
eagerly wait behind a white chalk
line in Terre Haute. Both coaches
will step off their respective buses
with the title "Great Lakes Coach
of the Year" attached to their
names. Their expectations will
be high; they will both emphasize
the process more than the result.
Then the gun will sound.
In the coaching race for Michi-
gan, McGuire has an 18-year lead.
But he shouldn't look back, Gibby
isn't far off the pace.

Michigan coach Greg Ryan hopes to
take his team tothe Sweet 16 for the
second year in a row.
While the defense makes any
shot attempt almost impossible
to convert on, Michigan has also
created multiple scoring opportu-
nities on offense. Ezurike is dan-
gerous downfield as she tends to
linger in front of the net, waiting
for the perfect cross - as was the
case Saturday.
Meanwhile freshman forward
Madisson Lewis had an explosive
performance on Saturday that
made the first-round win pos-
sible. Lewis' ability to be a key
player reflects the maturation of
the Wolverines' younger players
this season.
"It's having a huge effect for
the team right now," Ryan said.
"When we were struggling, it was
because we weren't getting the
same level of impact form these
players. We needed these guys to
really pick it up for us, and they
have."
A lot of Michigan's success
comes from havingthe right men-
tality. The team has focused on
not looking too far ahead, and the
Wolverines are especially cau-
tious now in a six-game tourna-
ment where elimination can come
at any moment.
"We work on making sure the
kids are focused on the process of
winning," Ryan said. "You're not
going to win because you want to,
but you're going to win because
you perform well."

15 rebounds.
Against Detroit Mercy and
Western Michigan, every Wol-
verine that dressed saw game
action. At home against the
Panthers, four players reached
double-digits, and Michigan
shot better than 50 percent from
the floor for the first time this
season.
"That really shows the
growth of our team," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "Once we get against
those experienced teams in our
league, those teams that we're
going to play next weekend, we
need everybody clicking on all
cylinders."
2. The Wolverines have a lot of
stamina.
Three games in five days is a
lot, even for a professional team,
so the pressure to succeed was
especially strong for the Wol-
verines during this stretch. But
rather than crumbling under the
pressure of strenuous schedul-
ing, the team showed endurance
on the court. In the Pittsburgh
game, five Michigan players saw
more than 20 minutes on the
court, and four saw more than
30 minutes.
"For those of you that haven't
seen our team in a while since
last year, you will recognize the
difference in their appearance
immediately," Barnes Arico
said at media day. "They've all
really committed to getting
themselves in better shape, and
getting themselves where they
need to be in order for us to be
successful this year."
Their victories are not only
a testament to the commit-
ment the team has made to
workouts in the gym, but also
an indication of the maturity
and focus this young team has.
After struggling to get to the
free-throw line against the
Broncos on Monday, the Wol-
verines posted a season-high 22
attempts from the charity stripe
against Pittsburgh. Barnes
Arico has stressed that making
small changes bring about big
results, and Michigan proved
her right on Wednesday.
3. Working on rebounds really
pays off.
Barnes Arico has stressed
the importance of rebounding
again and again since the start
of the season. And apparently,
her team has caught on. The
team total for rebounds versus
Detroit was 48, and two days
later against Western Michigan
that number rose to 59.

The Wolverines have out-
rebounded all but one team
they've played this season.
Junior guard Nicole Elmblad,
the only starter from last sea-
son, continues to lead the team
in rebounds with 10 per game.
4. Michigan knows how to han-
dle the world's tallest teenager.
Against Pittsburgh on
Wednesday, size was a serious
concern. The Panthers roster
boasts four girls measuring at or
above six feet, but one in partic-
ular stands out. The world's tall-
est teenager, freshman center
Marvadene "Bubbles" Ander-
son, stands at 6-foot-11.
"With their athleticism,
their ability to drive to the bas-
ket and their big kid inside, we
said, 'Let's pack it in the paint,'
" Barnes Arico said. "And then
they go out and take 253s."
While the game plan was
thrown off, Michigan was able
to adjust its defense without
leaving Bubbles open down low.
The Wolverines forced her into
foul trouble in the first half,
and 6-foot-4 senior center Val
Driscoll laid on the pressure,
recording a career-high three
steals.
5. Goree and Elmblad will con-
tinue to make an impact.
Michigan only has three play-
ers returning from last season
who saw playing time, and they
have all stepped up to lead the
team this season. Against West-
ern Michigan, Elmblad recorded
her fourth straight game with
at least 10 rebounds. Two days
later, she got her fourth double-
figure game of the season with
19 points, tying the career high
she set against Xavier.
"She came out in the second
half and just was incredible,"
Barnes Arico said. "She was
really a difference maker, led
our team in rebounding and just
finished plays."
Sophomore guard Madison
Ristovski has found a niche on
the offensive side of things, and
Goree has also shined on the
court. Goree hit the buzzer-
beater to send the Wolverines
into overtime against Arizona
and is averaging 10.5 points and
8.2 rebounds in 27.5 minutes per
game. Both Elmblad and Goree
have recorded two double-dou-
bles this season and are tied for
the Big Ten lead.

Stauskas leads
3-point barrage

Sophomore guard Nik Stauskas scored a career-high 24 points to lead all scorers in Michigan's 85-61 victory over Long Beach State on Thursday.ASSOCAITED PRESS
Michigan wins first-round
tilt with Long Beach State

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
. SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -
After seeing two underdogs,
Northeastern and Charlotte, pre-
vail in the first two games of the
Puerto Rico Tip-Off on Thursday,
the Michigan men's basketball
team wasn't taking anything for
granted against Long Beach State
- a team over which Michigan
was favored by 16.
With a considerably larger fan
base pres-
ent, the LBSU 61
14th-ranked IMICHIGAN 85
Wolverines
struck quick, taking a 7-0 lead.
After winning the tip, freshman
guard Derrick Walton Jr. swished
a three from the corner to open
up the scoring for Michigan. The
same result followed on its next
possession as sophomore forward
Glenn Robinson III hit the bottom
of the netin the team's 85-61 win.
Walton would make another
3-pointer to push Michigan's lead
back to seven after an early push-
back by the 49ers.
Factoring in the letdown of
their loss to Iowa State, this game
was a pick me-up for the Wolver-
ines.
"What happened in Ames, Iowa
was really helpful for tonight,"
said Michigan coach John Beilein.
While the Wolverines (3-1)
made 12 of their first 17 points
from beyond the arc, Long Beach
State (1-4) was having no issue
attacking the basket either.
That seemed to change when
sophomores Mitch McGary and
Spike Albrecht came into the
game with 13:14 left in the first
half. With all five players from last
year's recruiting class on the floor,
Michigan went to work.
The Wolverines ran the floor,
going on a 15-0 run, beginning
with McGary getting an and-one
opportunity, but he would miss
the free throw. Guards Nik Staus-
kas and Caris LeVert followed
with 3-pointers - one looked so
good Albrecht was already trot-
ting back on defense before it
went in.

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -
Mitch McGary was named to
several preseason All-America
teams, and had Glenn Robinson
III declared for the NBA Draft,
he would have been a lottery
pick.
But through four games, it's
looking like neither' McGary
or Robinson will be the Michi-
gan men's basketball team's
go-to scorer. Sophomore guard
Nik Stauskas has exploded as
the Wolverines' top offensive
weapon, and as play-by-play
announcers in almost every
Michigan game like to remind
their audiences, he's more than
just a shooter.
But despite an impressive
knack for finding multiple ways
to score this season, Stauskas
is still at his best when shoot-
ing from distance. And on
Thursday, the sophomore made
the basket look as wide as the
Atlantic Ocean, which is visible
from Coliseo Roberte Clemente.
Stauskas scored a career-high
24 points to lead all scorers in
the Wolverines' 85-61 victory
over Long Beach State.
It was the third time in four
games that the sophomore has
scored 20 or more points, after
eclipsing the mark just twice
last season. Stauskas now leads
the team in scoring with 18.5
points per game.
Playing thousands of miles
away from his hometown of Mis-
sissauga, Ont., Stauskas looked
right at home on the Caribbean
island, shooting a highly pro-
ficient 7-of-10 from the field,
including 4-of-6 from long
range. He was also 6-for-8 from
the free-throw line for the third
time this year - an encouraging
sign for the guard, who has been
able to capitalize on the respect
other teams have been giving
him from long range.
"Our guys did a really good
job of getting into the lane and
finding me when I was open,"
Stauskas said.
But it was an unassisted buck-
et - one the sophomore created
for himself - that put a stop to
a 49er run that had chopped the
Wolverines' lead to nine with
less than nine minutes to play.
Michigan coach John Beilein
termed it a "big, big, big shot" -
calling it the team's first big shot
of the young season.
"It wasn't part of a play. It was
just Nik doing what he does,"
Beilein said.
The coach has stressed all off-
season that his team would need
to replace the production it got
from Trey Burke and Tim Hard-
away Jr. last season, and while
Stauskas admitted that, "it's
kind of tough to replace that,"

Sophomore guard Nik Stauskas has
hecome Michigan's go-to scorer early
in the 2013-14 season.
he has stepped up as the early
front-runner for Michigan's top
option.
Stauskas wasn't the only Wol-
verine who had a field day from
beyond the arc, though. Long
Beach State opened with a tri-
angle-and-two defense, which
freshman point guard Derrick
Walton Jr. and Robinson quickly
turned into back-to-back threes
on Michigan's opening posses-
sions. Sophomore guard Caris
LeVert matched Stauskas's four
3-pointers, and Walton's three
long-range makes helped the
Wolverines set a new tourna-
ment 3-point field-goal record
with 14.
After the team shot just 27.6
percent from deep in a loss to
Iowa State on Sunday, Thurs-
day's 46.2-percent mark was a
welcomed sight for Michigan.
But still, the Wolverines' reli-
ance on 3-pointers - reminis-
cent of Beilein's early years with
the program - could prove wor-
risome when the team goes cold
like it did in Ames, Iowa.
The 30 3-point attempts
against the 49ers were a season
high, though the team shot 47
total 3-pointers in its previous
two games - well above last
year's average of 19.7.
Still, if Stauskas is receiving
the bulk of those looks, Michi-
gan should be in a good place.
The sophomore's touch from
deep - certainly one of the
best in the nation - went cold
throughout most of Big Ten play
last year, but after adding 16
pounds in the offseason, teams
shouldn't be able to easily out-
rhvntalhiman v ln nze

ASSOcIATED PREss
Michigan coach John Beilein and the Michigan basketball team escaped the upsets that shook other first-round favorites.

With solid defense on the other
end, the run spanned nearly four
minutes and saw Michigan extend
its lead to 18.
When the 49ers chipped away
at the Wolverines' lead, cutting
it down to single digits, Michi-
gan kept countering back. LeVert
forced a turnover and converted
an off-balance jumper near the
basket to push the lead back to 10.
Stauskas added a dunk on a back-
door pass from McGary.
Stauskas knocked down anoth-
er triple before halftime to give
Michigan a 13-point lead heading
into the break, as the Wolverines
matched their amount of threes
made against Iowa State (eight),
but on 18 shots, 11 less than was
needed on Sunday.
Stauskas led Michigan in scor-
ing for the second straight game,
tallying16 of his career-high 24 in
the first half on 5-for-7 shooting.
Additionally, LeVert and Robin-
son scored 20 and 14 points each,
respectively.
But, like the second halves of
the tournament's previous two
games, there would be a come-
back. The Wolverines 18-point
lead began to diminish.
"I think that Long Beach State
just wouldn't go away," Beilein
said. "They hit six threes and

were right there. Thank goodness
we shot it even better than that."
After a 3-pointer by freshman
guard Zak Irvin with 13 minutes
remaining in the game, Long
Beach State answered with a 12-3
run to once again cut the lead to
nine.
"You know at this time of the
year, given the experience on both
teams, there's going to be runs,"
Beilein said. "They made a great
run."
It was after a miscalled and
corrected shot clock violation that
Michigan finally ended the run.
With 16 seconds put back on the
clock, Michigan took advantage
of the second chance as Stauskas
nailed his fourth 3-pointer.
"We didn't have much time but
we picked up on the clock mistake
and Nik made a big, big, big shot,"
Beilein said. "That's probably one
of our first big shots of the season
because it was going the other
way quick. That wasn't part of a
play. That was Nik doing what he
does."
With one final chance to go on
a run with less than five minutes
left,the 49ersfaulted as LeVerthit
two dagger 3-pointers to push the
Wolverines' lead to 21 with 2:27
left. Michigan would finish with
14 threes, while shooting53.4 per-

cent from the field.
"We did a really good job in the
second half (in) that last 10 min-
utes stretch of really just pulling
away," Stauskas said.
The Wolverines will be back
in action on Friday night, playing
Florida State, which beat Virginia
Common Wealth, 85-67.

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - It
may have been a smaller group
than what Michigan is used to
when playing at home or on the
road back in the United States
- excluding territories - but the
Michigan cheering section on
Thursday, at the Puerto Rico Tip-
Off, was more than proficient.
Taking up the majority of
the court-level seats behind the
Wolverine and Long Beach State
benches, the group of 200 fans
made its presence known from
before the game began.
It started outside Coliseo
Roberto Clemente at 4 p.m. as
Georgetown and Northeastern
fans exited the building follow-
ing the conclusion of their game.
With the arena closed off due to
a break in action - Thursday's
four games were divided into two

sets of back-to-back games - fans
stood in maize and blue patiently
awaiting the night's game.
As the team took the court at
around five to warm up, the sec-
tion didn't look so full. As Michi-
gan took the locker room for its
pregame speech by coach John
Beilein at 5:30 p.m., the section
started to fill.
By the time the Wolverines
came back out 20 minutes before
tipoff, they were welcomed with a
huge applause. A Puerto Rico flag
in Michigan's colors appeared.
A man with a cowbell started to
begin the traditions of a football
game at Michigan Stadium.
While the crowd couldn't
compare to one at the Big House,
it remained consistent in keep-
ing up a chant of "Go Blue!" and
"Let's go Blue!" throughout the
night.
As the players were intro-
duced, Michigan's starting five

clearly drew louder applause,
increasing in increments as the
next player was announced.
By the time the game started,
a decent amount of fans stood for
the duration.
With some wearing homemade
shirts, some customized ones and
some in maize "Vamos Azul!"
shirts, the section got loud as
Michigan began the game on a
7-0 run.
It only got louder when the
Wolverines went on a 15-0 run
later in the first half.
The only time when Long
Beach State's fans really made
noise was when it cut an 18-point
lead to nine in the second half.
And it could have been louder
too. Michigan fell victim to a shot
clock violation that the 49er fans
erupted in elation to when the
clock hit zero.
But that was reversed when
Michigan sophomore guard Nik

Stauskas hit a 3-pointer to end the
run and noise.
While the game remained in
Michigan's favor from that point
on, it wasn't until two late triples
by sophomore guard Caris LeVert
that the noise approached what
it had been in warmups and the
beginning of the game.
After the game ended and
Beilein had concluded his press
conference, he started to walk
back to Michigan's locker room.
With the lower concourse located
in the bowels of the building, the
possibility of Beilein or any player
or coach interacting with fans -
who were promenading back to
the locker room - existed.
Beilein was approached, but
not by a group of Michigan alum-
ni though. Heck, it wasn't even by
any college-aged students.
It was by a small group of
young boys, maybe 12 years old,
asking for a selfie with the coach.

New York string

ers. The music Brooklyn

Brooklyn Rider was born out of a
desire to use the rich medium of
the string quartet as a vehicle for
borderless communication. The
group features violinists Johnny
Gandelsman and Colin Jacobsen,
violist Nicholas Cords and cellist
Eric Jacobsen. With its wildly
eclectic voice, Brooklyn Rider is
re-fabricating the 300-year-old
form of the string quartet as an
essential and innovative 21st-cen-
tury ensemble.
Through the University Musi-
cal Society, the quartet will per-
form this week for Ann Arbor
audiences. Brooklyn Rider will
also collaborate with B61a Fleck, a
world-class banjo player. Togeth-
er, Fleck and the quartet will put
on a show-stopping performance
that will include original compo-
sitions by both artists.
One of the unique features
about Brooklyn Rider that distin-
guishes it from other performers
is its performance style and how it
relates to the audience. Speaking
to their listeners between pieces
and showing their respect for
music is one way that the musi-
cians interact with the audience.
The group also performsstand-

translates to the audience's expe-
rience.
"We reject the idea that a con-
cert is a static experience," said
violinist Nicholas Cords. "I think
there has been this thing in the
past when you're a performer,
and when you get up on the stage,
you purposely build a wall in
front of you to deliver your work
like a finished project. I think we
totally reject that. The audience
is a huge part of the performance
for us -- they give the energy and
the feedback - and this affects
our music-makinga lot."
While it may not be the most
daring or radical group to use the
string quartet in contemporary
classical music, over the last few
years, Brooklyn Rider has stead-
fastly demonstrated that it's one
of the most broad-minded groups
of individuals.
"Whether it's American music
or music from Iran or from the
indie rock world or from the
core classical tradition, like
Beethoven," Cords said, "Or
whether it's music that we write,
we're actually trying to define
what we do really broadly, which

Brooklyn Rider doesn't limit
its repertoire to any one part
of the world or a single era. Its
2012 album, Seven Steps, brought
together Beethoven's String
Quartet No. 14 in C-Sharp Minor,
"Together Into This Unknow-
able Night" by the young com-
poser Christopher Tignor, and
the group's own collectively com-
posed response to the piece.
This year, the quartet released
another album, Recursions, that
merges the works of a variety of
different composers, including
Igor Stravinsky, Paul Hindemith,
Alan Hovhaness, Edmund Rub-
bra and Cords himself. In one of
Fleck's most recently published
works, The Impostor, Brooklyn
Rider collaborated with the artist
to make a concerto of banjo and
string quartet.
"Today, there are so many dif-
ferent kinds of languages that
are next to each other in a world
where I think people's fears may
be more open than they ever
have been in terms of audiences,"
Cords said. "I think it's a great
time to be alive as a musician for
that sole reason."

mostly consist of
University postdocs - those who
have received their Ph.D., but are
not quite faculty. The series began
both as a way to reach out to the
community and a place for post-
docs to getteaching experience.
Dr. Fred Adams, a theoreti-
cal astrophysicist and professor
in the physics department at the
University, has been around since
the series' conception. Hehasbeen
the chair of the series for the last
five years and has given a few talks
himself.
"There's always this pressure,
and there should be pressure, for
scientists to communicate to the
general public, but that's actually
a hard thing to do," Adams said.
"It's hard for anyone to take the
science and make it accessible
for the public, but the public is
actually not that excited about it
either."
Saturday Morning Physics,
however, has seemed to capture
some attention. Due to uncer-
tainty about public reception, the
first lecture was held in a class-
room, but to the delight of the
series coordinators, there wasn't
enough room and a larger lecture
hall had to be opened up. Today,
because of the size of the audi-
ence, an overflow room is created
in the lecture hall next to the pri-
mary one where the talk is piped
in and the slides are posted.

BOOK REVIEW
Phone Call' balances
science and belief

By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
Daily Arts Writer
Mitch Albom made the jump
from sports columnist to best-
selling author through works
like "Tuesdays with Morrie,"
"The Five
People You
Meet in Heav-
en" and "The TheFirs 
Time Keeper." Th is
His newest Phone
novel, "The Call From
First Phone
Call from Heaven
Heaven," con- Mitch Albom
tinues in the
same vein of its Harper
predecessors,
examining the
complex issues of grief, belief
and hope with the warmth and
heart we've come to expect
from Albom.
The novel revolves around
the various residents of the
small northern Michigan town
of Coldwater (not to be confused
with the real town of Coldwa-
ter, located in Branch County).
It's a typical, quiet small town.
That is, until residents begin
receiving phone calls from what
appears to be their deceased
loved ones. No one's quite sure
whether to think these calls
are a miracle or a hoax. Before
long, the outside world finds
out about the phenomenon, and
masses of people - believers
and skeptics alike - flock to
Coldwater.
Much of the story is told from
the perspective of disgraced
ex-pilot Sully Harding. At the
beginning of the story, Sully has
just been released from prison,
serving a 10-month sentence
related to the plane crash he
was in the night his wife ended

up in a coma and eventually
died. Returning to his home-
town of Coldwater, a grieving
Sully finds himself surround-
ed by messages of heaven and
the afterlife. When Sully finds
out his young son is carrying
around a toy phone in the hopes
that his mother will call him
from heaven, he devotes him-
self entirely to disproving the
calls.
The skeptical Sully serves as
a nice foil to the enthusiasm of
the rest of the town, and keeps
the story from straying too far
from reality. This is Albom's
first work that plays out as a
real "whodunit" mystery, using
Sully as lead investigator and
representative of the reader. In
general, Albom succeeds in this
foray.
Interspersed throughout the
narrative are bits and pieces of
information about the life of
Alexander Graham Bell and the
1876 invention of the telephone.
You might think these inter-
ludes would disrupt the flow of
the story, but Albom smoothly
handles the transitions, work-
ing them to his advantage in
furthering the plot. Plus, you
learn a lot of really interesting
facts about Graham Bell. For
instance, his wife Mabel Hub-
bard was completely deaf due to
a near fatal bout of scarlet fever.
Crazy!
The book's a bit longer than
Album's other novels. It's not
an arduous read, though, as
it relies heavily on dialogue
and uses short, to-the-point
descriptions.
There's a reason Albom's
works stay on bestseller lists
for weeks on end; he's an
engaging writer. There are no
frills or long, flowery intervals

(impressive since most of his
works have a theological slant).
There's a spark in the simplic-
ity of his writing that keeps
his work dynamic. The longer
length of "The First Phone Call
from Heaven" allows for some
nice character development,
shown primarily through the
evolving relationships of the
townspeople. There's also a
good critique of extremism on
both sides of the religion-ver-
sus-science debate, as the two
camps consume the small town
in conflict.
Are you there,
God? It's me,
writer Mitch
Albom.
The only problematic aspect
of the story is its supposedly
ambiguous ending. A novel
dealing with the concepts of
heaven and belief almost needs
to end in uncertainty; of course
no one knows what happens
after death. While Albom tries
to play up this ambiguity, cul-
minating in a singular event,
I found the incident too eas-
ily explained away by previ-
ous events in the novel. It's not
quite the spinning top at the end
of "Inception."
If you've enjoyed his previ-
ous works, chances are you're
going to like "The First Phone
Call from Heaven." If, howev-
er, you don't count yourself an
Albom fan, this will be the one
to change your mind.

Her entries are short - even
the longer ones - and so is the
book itself. This isn't a grand
assemblage of the author's
notes, but rather a modest,
sparsely used notebook from
her time at the University of
Iowa in 1946 -47, discovered
years after her death. At times,
in all its chaos and ambiguity,
her collection barely coheres to
a logical progression.
"The rest of us have lost our
power to vomit," she suddenly
concludes in a May entry about
Christ and modern prophets.
