ADMINISTRATION
In wake of
outcry, 'U'
to rethink
service plan

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
Business Prof. Scott Masten speaks at a meeting of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs at the Fleming Administration Building Monday to
discuss the University's decision to suspend the Administrative Services Transformation,
Deaypraised b aut

Shared service
decision met with
relief as SACUA
braces for more talks
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily Staff Reporter
The Senate Advisory Com-
mittee for University Affairs is
praising the University's recent
decision to postpone the imple-
mentation of a Shared Services
Center which was expected
to save the University $5 mil-
lion annually by consolidating

human-resources and finance
employees, who are currently
department specific to a central
location.
As the representative body
for University faculty, SACUA
has voiced its concern regard-
ing the shared-services initia-
tive to the administration at the
last few Senate Assembly meet-
ings. Many members expressed
relief Monday that the admin-
istration has decided to delay
Administrative Services Trans-
formation.
In a letter published in the
University Record, University
administrators announced that
the moving of staff to the cen-

ter will be delayed past April to
accommodate further discus-
sion with faculty and staff. The
letter noted that interviews for
individuals who are expected
to move to the center will con-
tinue in the meantime.
University Provost Mar-
tha Pollack, the executive vice
president for academic affairs,
will also be establishing facul-
ty-led committees to undertake
the major issues facing the Uni-
versity, including faculty pro-
ductivity, diversity and campus
climate, and financial chal-
lenges with cost containment,
according to the letter.
In the letter, Pollack, E.

Royster Harper, vice president
for student life, and Timothy
Slottow, executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer,
wrote that "the passion and
concern for the University's
future direction is palpable."
Though the mood of the
meeting was light following
this decision, most SACUA
members were realistic about
the fact that discussion will
eventually continue.
"I wouldn't say we're done
with the (Administrative Ser-
vices Transformation)," Busi-
ness Prof. Scott Masten said.
He added that he's happy with

Planned shared
service center will
be delayed until at
least April 2014
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
After weeks of faculty outcry,
a stack of letters from University
departments and a petition signed
by more than 1,000 faculty mem-
bers, University administrators
announced Monday they would
delay the planned transition to a
Shared Services Center.
The Shared Services Center, a
component of the Administrative
Services Transformation initia-
tive, was designed to consolidate
some University departmental
staff in a central service center, a
move estimated to save the Uni-
versity about $5 million annually.
In response to concerns regard-
ing the project's transparency and
implications for University depart-
ments, the University announced

that all staff moves would be
delayed until after April, the peri-
od originally slated for staffing
transitions,
University Provost Martha Pol-
lack; E. Royster Harper, vicepresi-
dent for student life; and Timothy
Slottow, executive vice president
and chief financial officer, wrote in
the letter the administration plans
to immediately involve faculty in
reevaluating the structure of the
shared services program.
By including faculty, the admin-
istrators wrote that they hope to
create a shared services program
that "is structured to meet the
needs of our faculty and our stu-
dents while achieving necessary
cost savings."
The letter noted that the deci-
sion to delay AST's implementa-
tion was made in consultation with
University President Mary Sue
Coleman.
Under the plan, each school and
college would work with their fac-
ulty to determine the best steps
to proceed with AST. However,
the University will go ahead with

WATER YOU DOING?

University offers
$12.8M, but city
can match bid to
buy property
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily Staff Reporter
The University has plans to
purchase a 16.7-acre property
at 2500 South State St. previ-
ously owned by the Edwards
Brothers Malloy printing for
$12.8 million.
Edwards Brothers, a
120-year-old company, has
used the 185,000-square-foot
facility as a manufacturing
plant. The company is the
fifth-largest book and journal
manufacturer in the country
and has more than $100 mil-
lion in annual sales.
The company plans to
merge the State Street plant
with its other Ann Arbor
location, an 180,000-square-
foot plant on Jackson Road.
Edwards Brothers announced
the State Street plant's clo-
sure in July.
The property is located one
mile from the University's
athletics facilities on South
Campus and sits near a Uni-
versity commuter lot.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the property is
in a key location for the Uni-
versity, as it is surrounded
by the Athletics Campus and y
other University buildings.
"When strategic pieces

of property like this become
available, it makes good sense
for the University to pursue
properties that would be in
such strategic locations,"
Fitzgerald said.
Since the purchase has not
yet been finalized, Fitzgerald
said it is too early for him to
disclose what the University
might use the building for.
The purchase must be
approved by the University's
Board of Regents before it
is finalized. Additionally,
Edwards Brothers approved
a right of first refusal from
the Ann Arbor City Council,
or the right for the city to be
able to purchase the building
before any other party. The
city could purchase the prop-
erty within a 60-day period of
the agreement between the
company and the University.
The city would have to
match the University's offer
on the property. While the
company made this agree-
ment with the city, Fitzgerald
said Edwards Brothers also
approached the University
about purchasing the prop-
erty.
John Edwards, president
and CEO of Edward Brothers,
said in a statement that he is
pleased with the deal.
"It helps us protect jobs,
stay here in Washtenaw
County and be competitive
in a very difficult industry,"
Edwards said.

CITY COUNCIL
Crosswalk
ordinance
wil remain
unchanged
After amendments
pass, Hieftje vows
to veto updated
legislation
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily Staff Reporter
Community members came out in
droves Monday night to support the
current crosswalk ordinance and
prevent its repeal, which was being
considered before the Ann Arbor
City Council. Thanks to a surprise
veto promise by Mayor John Hieftje,
they'll get their wish.
The original proposal to repeal
the ordinance was altered after
Councilmember Stephen Kunsel-
man (D-Ward 3) requested that Ann
Arbor instead adopt the wording of
ordinance drafted by the Traverse
City, Mich., city council. That vote
passed 6-4, but immediately after its
passing, the mayor promised to veto
the proposal.
"Changing the ordinance, I just
don't see a way how that can possi-
bly help," Hieftje said to the council
during discussion before the vote. "I
think the city is safer for pedestrians
now than before; I think a good deal
of progress has been made. Driv-
ers are stopping for pedestrians at
a higher rate now than they were a
few years ago."
Traverse City's simple ordinance
requires drivers to stop and yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians who are
walking within a marked crosswalk
where atraffic signal is not present.
A repeal of the ordinance would
have meant Ann Arbor would adopt

Area sees increase
in restaurants,
decrease in shops
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
While State Street has seen
an influx of new businesses over
the past few years, the changes
to Ann Arbor's Main Street have
been more subtle. The street,
known for its unique shopping
and more upscale. restaurants,
is becoming increasingly food-
centric.
Maura Thomson, execu-

tive director of the Main Street
Area Association, said the street
transformed from a shop-heavy
area in favor of an abundance
of restaurants in the past five
years.
Dennis Serras, owner of
Real Seafood Company since
1975 said he has watched Main
Street's decline in shopping
attractions since the opening
of Briarwood Mall in the 1973.
Since then, the surrounding
eateries have become more con-
temporary, adding fresh faces to
older locations, Serras said.
Serras is a co-founder of
Main Street Ventures, which
owns Gratzi, Palio, Chop House

and La Dolce
Vita on Main
Street, and
Carson's'
American Bistro on Plymouth
Road. The company also owns
restaurants in Maryland, Ohio,
West Virginia and Florida.
"It's a testimony to the suc-
cess of the restaurants that
have been here for a long
time," Thomson said. "Other
restaurateurs see the success
that restaurants are having in
downtown Ann Arbor and they
see that this community really
demands quality food and does
spend some of their extra earn-

GROOVIN' -

Prof. looks at water in new way

Uo Becker is a professor of
earth and environmental sci-
ences. He started teaching at
the University in 2002, and his
research focuses on mineral sur-
face chemistry, nanoscience and
computational mineralogy.
What got you interested in
science,andwhy didyouchoose
to teach at the University?
I was always interested in
science since I was little, even
before elementary school. I
started teaching here in 2002
when they had an interesting
opening. I'm from Germany, and
I was looking for jobs world-
wide, but this seemed to be an

interesting opportunity and a
good school. This is a depart-
ment where I could do what I
wanted to do. I'm in a relatively
small field, and I had people to
collaborate with which also got
me interested in applying here.
What is your favorite class
to teach?
Right now I'm teaching Water
and the Environment, which
asks, how does water behave in
the environment, and how do
we use water? And then I teach a
graduate class on computational
technology (whicp deals with)
the mechanics of atoms and
minerals. It's a more esoteric

course, but it also has environ-
mental applications, so we apply
what we learn to how radioac-
tive atoms behave in the envi-
ronment. But the class I really
like is a 300-level class called
Environmental Geochemistry
for more advanced undergrads.
It's essentially the chemistry of
everything in the environment,
from the atmosphere to ground-
water to 'rivers to natural pro-
cesses.

Investigation discovers speed a
factor in deadly train derailing

Former medical tech gets 39
years for infecting patients

Rail experts say
automated safety
technology could have
prevented crash
YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) - A com-
muter train that derailed over the
weekend, killing four passengers,
was hurtling at 82 mph as it entered
a30 mph curve, afederal investiga-
tor said Monday. But whether the
wreck was the result of human
error or mechanical trouble was
unclear, he said.
Rail experts said the tragedy
might have been prevented if Met-
ro-North Railroad had installed
automated crash-avoidance tech-
nology that safety authorities have
been urging for decades.
The locomotive's speed was
extracted from the train's two data
recorders after the Sunday morn-
ing accident, which happened in
the Bronx along a bend so sharp

that the speed limit drops from 70
mph to 30 mph.
Asked why the train was going
so fast, National Transportation
Safety Board member Earl Weener
said: "That's the question we need
to answer."
Weener would not disclose
what the engineer operating the
train told investigators, and he
said results of drug and alcohol
tests were not yet available. Inves-
tigators are also examining the
engineer's cellphone, apparently
to determine whether he was dis-
tracted.
"When I heard about the speed,
Igulped," said Sen. Charles Schum-
er, D-N.Y.
Engineers may not use cell-
phones while on the train,
according to the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, which
runs Metro-North.
The engineer, William Rock-
efeller, was injured and "is totally
traumatized by everything that
has happened," said Anthony Bot-

H,-,,0

talico, executive director of the rail
employees union.
He said Rockefeller, 46, was
cooperating fully with investi-
gators.
"He's a sincere human being
with an impeccable record that I
know of. He's diligent and compe-
tent," Bottalico said. Rockefeller
has been an engineer for about 11
years and a Metro-North employee
for about 20, he said.
Outside Rockefeller's modest
house in Germantown, N.Y., police
told reporters that at the request of
the family, anyone who trespassed
would be arrested. Calls to the
home wentunanswered.
The NTSB's Weener sketched
a scenario that suggested that the
train's throttle was let up and the
brakes-were fully applied way too
late to stave off disaster.
He said the throttle went to idle
six seconds before the derailed
train came to a complete stop -
"very late in the game" for a train
going that fast - and the brakes
were fully engaged five seconds
before the train stopped.
It takes about a quarter-mile to
a half-mile to stop a train going 82
mph,Kevin Thompson,FederalRail-
road Administration spokesman.
Asked whether the tragedy was
the result of human error or faulty
brakes, Weener said: "The answer
is, at this paint in time, we can't tell.
But he said investigators are not
aware of any problems with the
brakes during the nine stops the
train made before the derailment.
The wreck came two years
before the federal government's
deadline for Metro-North and
other railroads to install automat-
ic-slowdown technology designed
to prevent catastrophes caused by
human error.
Metro-North's parent agency
and other railroads hake pressed
the government to extend Con-
gress' 2015 deadline a few years
because of the cost and complex-
ity of the Positive Train Control
system, which uses GPS, wireless
radio and computers to monitor
trains and stop them from collid-
ing, derailing or going the wrong
way.

Man reportedly
used stolen syringes
to infect patients
with hepatitis C
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -
A traveling medical techni-
cian who stole painkillers and
infected dozens of patients in
multiple states with hepatitis
C through tainted syringes was
sentenced Monday to 39 years
in prison.
"I don't blame the families
for hating me," David Kwiat-
kowski said after hearing about
20 statements from people he
infected and their relatives. "I
hate myself."
Kwiatkowski, 34, was a car-
diac technologist in 18 hospi-
tals in seven states before being
hired at New Hampshire's
Exeter Hospital in 2011.
He had moved from job to job
despite being fired at least four
times over allegations of drug
use and theft. Since his arrest
last year, 46 people have been
diagnosed with the same strain
of hepatitis C he carries.
U.S. Attorney John Kacavas
said the sentence "ensures that
this serial infector no longer is
in a position to do harm to inno-
cent and vulnerable;people."
Kwiatkowski admitted steal-
ing painkillers and replacing
them with saline-filled syring-
es tainted with his blood. He
pleaded guilty in August to 16
federal drug charges.
Before he was sentenced,
Kwiatkowski stood and faced
his victims, saying he was very
sorry and that his crimes were
caused by an addiction to pain-
killers and alcohol. He told
investigators he had been steal-
ing drugs since at least 2003
and swapping syringes since at
least 2008.
"There's no excuse for what
I've done," he said. "I know
the pain and suffering I have
caused."
Prosecutors asked for a

40-year sentence. Judge Joseph
Laplante said he cut the last
year as a reminder that some
people have the capacity for
mercy and compassion.
"It's important for you to
recognize and remember as
you spend the next 39 years in
prison to focus on the one year
you didn't get and try to devel-
op that capacity in yourself,"
Laplante said.
The victims spoke angrily
and tearfully of the pain that
Kwiatkowski had inflicted
by giving them hepatitis C,
a blood-borne virus that can
cause liver disease and chronic
health problems. Authorities
say the disease played a role in
one woman's death.
"You may only be facing drug
charges, but make no mistake,
you are a serial killer," said
Kathleen Murray of Elmira,
N.Y., whose mother was infect-
ed in Baltimore and was too ill
to travel to New Hampshire for
the sentencing.
Linda Ficken, 71, said she is
haunted by the memory of Kwi-
atkowski standing at her hospi-
tal bedside in Kansas for more
than an hour applying pressure
to the catheter's entry site in
her leg to control bleeding.
"On one hand, you were sav-
ing my life, and on the other
hand, your acts are a death sen-
tence for me," Ficken, of Ando-
ver, Kan., told him. "Do I thank
you for what you did to help me?
Do I despise you for what your
actions did and will continue to
do for the rest of my life? Or do
I simply just feel sorry-for you
being the pathetic individual
you are?"
Prosecutors said Kwiatkows-
ki deserved 40 years for creat-
ing a "national public health
crisis," putting a significant
number of people at risk and
caused substantial physical and
emotional harm to a large num-
ber of victims.
Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Farley called Kwiatkowski's
actions "exceedingly cal-
lous" and "unbelievably cruel"

and noted that Kwiatkowski
could've .stolen painkillers
without exposing his patients
to hepatitis C.
Defense lawyers argued that
a 30-year sentence would better
balance the seriousness of the
crimes against Kwiatkowski's
mental and emotional problems
and his addiction to drugs and
alcohol, which they said cloud-
ed his judgment.
"David Kwiatkowski is not a
monster," said attorney Bjorn
Lange. "He didn't set out to
infect himself or anyone else
with the hepatitis C virus."
In all, 32 patients were
infected in New Hampshire,
seven in Maryland, six in Kan-
sas and one in Pennsylvania.
Though prosecutors have not
included the Pennsylvania case
in their count, a spokeswoman
for the Usiversity of Pittsburgh
Medical Center has repeatedly
said the hospital had one con-
firmed case. Kwiatkowski also
worked in Michigan, New York,
Arizona and Georgia.
Two of the 16 charges stem
from the case of Eleanor Mur-
phy, a Kansas woman who has
since died. Authorities say hepa-
titis C playeda contributingrole.
"You ultimately gave my
mother a death sentence," Mur-
phy's son, Ronnie, told Kwiat-
kowski.
Murphy said he would have
preferred a life sentence for
Kwiatkowski and didn't under-
stand how he had been able
to continue working after his
repeated firings.
"His path and my moth-
er's path never should have
crossed," he said.
The judge noted that while
Kwiatkowski's lack of a crimi-
nal record kept his sentence
from going even higher, he said
that was only because Kwiat-
kowski's employers handled his
behavior as personnel matters
instead of crimes. And Kacavas
said his office has begun work-
ing with other agencies to draft
policy recommendations to pre-
vent future incidents.

On perhaps the busiest online

likely to prompt more states to
attempt to collect taxes on Inter-

legalized in Hawaii
Retired professors Rod Pow-
ell and Bob Eddinger have been
partners in life since 1977.
On Monday, they joined in
marriage on the first day it was
legally possible in their home
state of Hawaii.
Powell says they wanted to
celebrate the beginning of same-
sex marriages in the state as a
significant moment in society's
movement toward equality and
justice.
The 78-year-old and 74-year-
old met 36 years ago on the
Manoa campus of the University
of Hawaii.
The state Department of
Health says it issued 40 licenses
for same-sex marriages in the
hours since it began accepting
applications at midnight.
Department spokeswoman
Janice Okubo says almost all the
licenses were issued to couples
on Oahu.

A growing body of evidence
collected by U.N. investigators
points to the involvement of
senior Syrian officials, includ-
ing President Bashar Assad, in
crimes against humanity and
war crimes, the U.N.'s top human
rights official said Monday.
The statement by Navi Pillay,
who heads the U.N. Office of the
High Commissioner for Human
Rights, adds to the pressure for
quicker action on Syria ahead of
a key peace conference planned
for Geneva in January. The con-
ference, brought on by combined
U.N., U.S. and Russian diploma-
cy, would for the first time bring
the Assad government and oppo-
nents together for face-to-face
negotiations.
"As we look around the world
at the end of 2013, we see exam-
ples of situations where that
readiness of the international
community to act in time is
already being sorely tested," Pil-
lay told a news conference that
touched on trouble spots around
the world.
"In addition to Syria, where
the scale and viciousness of the
abuses being perpetrated by
elements on both sides almost
defies belief, the situation in the
Central African Republic is dete-
riorating rapidly, and the alarm
bells are ringing loud and clear."

University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the letter gets
across that the University has
opted to take the time to consid-
er about alternative structures.
Engineering Prof Faw-
waz Ulaby, who authored
the href=http://www.
michigandaily.com/news/
faculty-petition-shared-servic-
es-center>petition, said the Uni-
versity's announcement shows
the faculty has gotten the atten-
tion of the administration.
However, he added that the
University's response does
nothing but delay the eventual
AST implementation.
Ulaby said the University
should be terminating AST, not
setting a timetable. He added
administrators should form
committees to study the best
direction for University cost
containment.
"The fundamental problem
is AST is flawed and bad for the
campus, and it should be termi-
nated - period," he said.
At LSA's regularly scheduled
faculty meeting held Monday
afternoon, Pollack and Slot-
tow again acknowledged the
University's mishandling of
shared services and attempted
to assure faculty their concerns
would not only be considered
but play a central role in future
decision-making processes.
"I'm committed to cost sav-
ings because I have no choice...
but I'm also committed to
repairing the damage that's
been done during the rollout of
AST," Pollack said.
At the end of the meeting, the
LSA faculty approved a motion
to vote next week to support a
two-year moratorium on the
Shared Services Transition. The
motion has been placed on the
agenda for the Dec. 9 LSA fac-
ulty meeting.
During the question-and-
answer session, Dena Good-
man, professor of history and
women's studies, asked if the
administration would be willing
to abandon AST all together.

Slottow said if the Univer-
sity were to give up on AST,
administrators would need to
find savings elsewhere. From
conversations with Coleman,
regents and deans over the past
few days, Slottow said there are
still alternative options.
"While I understand the sen-
timent to say 'just stop it,' the
sense of a lot of people is that
that would be irresponsible,"
Pollack added. "It's our respon-
sibility to move forward, but to
do it right."
One faculty member asked
Pollack how the University
could stand behind the vision of
a few administrators while 1,100
faculty members protest the
very nature of AST.
"I trust the faculty more, but
I want to say this, there is mis-
information on both sides," Pol-
lack said. "I am with the faculty.
I am a faculty member."
Two faculty members also
raised overarching concerns
regarding AST. Two faculty
members questioned the Uni-
versity's relationship with
Accenture LLC - the consult-
ing firm with an $11.7 million
contract to implement the ini-
tiative.
Slottow said administrators
regret how Accenture's selec-
tion was communicated to fac-
ulty.
"That is a failure," Slottow
said. "I'm accountable for that;
I feel responsible for that."
Faculty have expressed
concern with Accenture's
fee as well as its reputation
and connections with Rowan
Miranda, the University asso-
ciate vice president for finance
who formerly served as lead
on Accenture's state and local
government and higher educa-
tion portfolios. In November,
Slottow released a statement
addressing faculty member's
concerns.
At the LSA meeting, Slottow
said AST is a complex program
- a program the University
does not have the resources
to carry out on its own. He
added that AST's project team
is composed of 24 University
representatives and 10 from
Accenture, aided by 100 faculty
and staff from across the Uni-
versity.

Slottow said the University
held a regularly audited com-
petitive bid process, during
which a number of firms made
offers for the AST contract. A
team of people from across the
University evaluated the bid
before choosing Accenture.
However, Slottow said the
firm has not performed at
the level administrators had
hoped it would and are "look-
ing at ways to reduce their
involvement."
Chemistry Prof. Charles
Brooks asked if the University
would disclose records related
to the decision, to which Slot-
tow responded by inviting any-
one to look at the Accenture
contract.
Brooks also asked why the
initiative's projected savings has
fallen from $17 million in reoc-
curringsavings to $6 million.
"As far as savings go, I have
been equally frustrated and
very angry with those num-
bers," Pollack said.
However, Pollack said the
decrease partly stems from the
University's decision to refrain
from running the transition like
a corporation. Instead of saying
each department needed to find
ten people to cut, the University
worked with department and
college leaders to figure out fea-
sible numbers.
Pollack said the University
never had any intent to hide
these updated projections from
the faculty but has traditionally
left cost containment projects
for administrators to grapple
with.
Describing the University's
established "paternalistic"
approach to cost-containment,
Pollack said there has been the
assumption that administrators
should make decisions regard-
ing efficiency and procure-
ment savings, allowing faculty
to focus on their research or
teaching.
In the future, Pollack prom-
ised to gather input from faculty
on similar issues, rather than
protecting them from some-
times painful cost cutting pro-
cesses.
"We've learned our lesson,"
she said. "I really do appreciate
the degree to which the faculty
is taking this seriously."

the administration's decision to
postpone the shared services ini-
tiative.
Many members echoed his
sentiments, noting that the
decision shows the voices of the
faculty have been heard.
Social Work Prof. Karen
Staller, chair of SACUA, said
the delay provides faculty with
more opportunities to par-
ticipate in the next phase of
research and discussion.
Laura Olsen, a biology pro-
fessor and SACUA member,
said that LSA faculty will ask

for a two-year suspension of the
entire initiative.
"In order for people to take
us seriously, we need to partici-
pate," Olsen said.
After revamping several
resolutions as a result of infor-
mation relayed in the article,
SACUA formally endorsed the
suspension of shared services.
SACUA plans to round out the
semester with a private meeting
with Pollack this Wednesday,
followed by a Regent's update
on Friday, a Senate Assembly
meeting on Monday, Dec. 9, and
a regular meeting with Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Cole-

ORDINANCE
From Page 1
the Michigan Uniform Traffic
Code wording, which requires
drivers to stop or slow for pedes-
trians in the crosswalk, not
including pedestrians at the edge
of the walk or on the curb as the
Ann Arbor ordinance currently
states.
The tone for the evening was
set during the public comment
section of the meeting, when
Erica Briggs, chair of the Washt-
enaw County Bicycling and Walk-
ing Coalition, asked for opponents
of the ban to stand and raise their
hands. The move brough roughly
three-fourths of the overflow-
ing chamber guests to their feet.
There were so many attendees at
the meeting that city employees
opened the chamber's retractable
walls.
The turnout may be the result
of a request for public support
at the meeting that was posted
onWBWC's website.
"You're placing the blame on
the pedestrians for getting hit or
killed in crosswalks, not on the
drivers who hit them in marked
crosswalks," Briggs told the coun-
cil, describing the consequences
should the law be repealed.
The public hearing before
the vote brought overwhelm-
ing opposition to the repeal. Ann
Arbor residents - including a few
University students - passion-
ately shared personal stories and
pleaded to the Council to recon-
sider the shift in policy. Some
raised concerns that the council
rushed to repeal the ordinance
without a full engineering analy-
sis. Others expressed a need for
a pedestrian-friendly city and
the importance of ensuring dis-
abled people have enough street
access without having to navigate
oncoming traffic.
Rackham student Lloyd Shel-
ton said the changed ordinance
would be exclusionary. He uses an
electrically powered wheelchair
and said crossing the street with-
out the current ordinance would

be incredibly burdensome.
"It's about inclusion; it's about
having a society that is designed
so that everybody has access to
everything," Shelton said.
Still, the councilmembers who
sponsored the repeal did not
waiver from their stance, sup-
porting the consistency of using
the UTC law like the rest of the
state.
The initial vote to repeal was
sponsored by Councilmembers
Sally Peterson (D-Ward 2), Sumi
Kailasapathy (D-Ward 1), Jane
Lumm (I-Ward 2), Mike Anglin
(D-Ward 5) and Kunselman, who
eventually in favor of the Traverse
City language. Councilmember
Jack Eaton (D-Ward 4) was the
sixth vote in favor.
Kunselman responded to the
arguments of limiting the access
for the elderly and disabled by
mentioning that it hadn't been an
issue before and wasn't specifi-
cally mentioned in any previous
wordings. He said he is ready to
move forward.
"This has been talked about
since well last summer; we heard
some former candidates for coun-
cil who were talking about it as
they were out there this last fall,"
Kunselman said. "There is a dif-
ferent perception besides just
those that are represented by the
Washtenaw Biking and Walking
Coalition."
Speakers on both sides of
the issue spoke to the need for
increased education, enforcement
and improved infrastructure,
many acknowledging that the
wording of the law will not auto-
matically change the behavior of
either drivers or pedestrians.
Councilmembers Kailasapa-
thy and Peterson, among others,
spokerepeatedly in favor of these
efforts, regardless of the law.
"What (tonight) shows is there
is a great need for infrastructure,
and that's what I take out of this.
There's a great need for disabled
people, older people, younger
people to cross the street," Kai-
lasapathy said in an interview.
"What do we do? Put HAWK
lights, crosswalks, put lights."

ings on going out to dinner."
Although Ann Arbor is home
to the University, Serras said the
restaurants are often expensive
along Main Street and draws an
older crowd than college stu-
dents.
"They're higher end; I mean,
you can go into them and see the
pricing on the menu. I would
say the demographic is slight-
ly older than undergrad; the
undergrads come when their
parents are picking up the bill,"
Serras said.
Maggie Long, managing
partner and executive chef
for the Jolly Pumpkin, also
said their primary business is
usually Ann Arbor locals and
graduate students, adding that

undergraduates usually live too
far away to frequent the area.
Long said patrons are attract-
ed by the local atmosphere and
"walkability" of the street, say-
ing the distance from campus
helps avoid the bustling student
foot traffic of State Street or
South University Avenue.
"Main Street is easy to read.
You can stand on the block and
look and see where you need to
go," Long said.
The street's accessibility and
vibrancy is not an accident,
Thomson said.
"We have lamp posts that
were put up on Main Street
twenty-plus years ago; they're
a little bit more decorative. We
have some mature trees, we
have our planter beds, we have
fairly wide sidewalks - all of
these things that you don't
necessarily think about as a

pedestrian but that does sort of
contribute to how you feel when
you're on Main Street," Thom-
son said.
LSA freshman Kaia Parenti
has been touring the city's food
scene with her older brother
Nicholas, a senior at the Uni-
versity. The two of them visit
a new restaurant every week.
Parenti has explored the dining
experience in many different
Ann Arbor neighborhoods now
but says that Main Street has its
own "welcoming vibe."
"There's a variety of different
restaurants and places to eat,
and they're all differentbutthey
all look very intriguing," Parenti
said.
While Parenti admits the
prices on Main Street can be
steep, she said she's happy to
pay to support good food, and
the money is worth the trip.

Adds pressure on
embattled nation
before peace talks
GENEVA (AP) - A growing
body of evidence collected by
U.N. investigators points to the
involvement of senior Syrian offi-
cials, including President Bashar
Assad, in crimes against human-
ity and war crimes, the U.N.'s top
human rights official said Mon-
day.
The statement by Navi Pillay,
who heads the U.N. Office of the
High Commissioner for Human

quicker action on Syria ahead of
a key peace conference planned
for Geneva in January. The con-
ference, brought on by combined
U.N., U.S. and Russian diplomacy,
would for the first time bring the
Assad government and oppo-

the scale and viciousness of the
abuses being perpetrated by ele-
ments on both sides almost defies
belief, the situation in the Central
African Republic is deteriorating

ringing loud and clear."
Pillay said the Syrian abuses
- suspected massacres, chemical
attacks, torture, rape and a litany
of other horrors - are being well
documented by an expert U.N.
panel of investigators.
"They've produced massive
evidence," she said. "They point
to the fact that the evidence indi-
cates responsibility at the highest
level of government, including
the head of state."
Syrian Deputy Foreign Minis-
ter Faisal Mekdad was dismissive
of Pillay's remarks.

Abort the special interests
Legislature should defer to voters on health insurance proposal
proposal before the state legislature could effectively ban abor-
tion coverage from health insurance plans. Right to Life of Mich-
igan, a group that advocates for restrictions on abortion rights,
has collected enough signatures to put the initiative in front of the legisla-
ture which could be enacted without the approval of the governor or vot-
ers. The proposal poses clear limitations to women's access to important
family planning options, and the nature with which the issue has gone
forward undermines the process. Lawmakers should avoid acting on the
proposal and wait until the next election to allow voters to decide what

n our society, we're expected
to run a race - a race that
will last from when we enter
this world
right down to
the moment
we leave it. To
move forward,
to be the best, to
succeed, we're
taught that
we must look KATE
to the future
and always be LARAMIE
thinking two
steps ahead.
The collegiate system epitomizes
this reality. when you're a college
student, you're constantly told that
the decisions you make now will
shape the future of your entire life
- a frightening thought for anyone,
particularly those with so little life
experience.
But my question is this: If we are
forever thinking about the future,
how can we find the time to figure
out exactly what we want in life
anyway? How can we run the race
without taking a moment to stop
and assess where we're going?
Two semesters ago I was hit
with this reality. I was a sopho-
more full of ambition but running
out of drive. I was tired of waking
up and thinking about everything
I needed to do tomorrow, never
having the time to focus on today. I
had to ask myself: Was the promise
of an eventual degree really worth
two-and-a-half more years of being
exhausted and burnt out? Did I
even have another option?
I was nervous about leaving the
University with only three semes-
ters under my belt. After being in

public education for nearly three-
quarters of my life, I had no idea
how to not be in school. But ironi-
cally enough, this realization was
enough to push me over the edge. It
was time to try something new, and
for me that meant leaving the Uni-
versity and learning to run my life a
little differently.
I moved back home, found a job
and got to work learning how to
wake up every morning and live
that day to the fullest, not worry-
ing about what was going to happen
tomorrow or next week.
And as it turns out, living in
the moment is something that just
takes a little practice. Before I left
Ann Arbor, I didn't know how to
not think about tomorrow or how
not to plan and worry and wonder
about my future - the race that I
was currently losing.
After some time, things began

caught up in the planning of tomor-
row, we'll never be able to fully
appreciate the world of today. For
those of us who are privileged
enough to attend a four-year uni-
versity, we should all recognize
that college is a choice. It's our
decision to be here, and pushing
through to finish in four years isn't
worth it if we aren't gaining every-
thing that could be gained if we
took a moment to slow down.
After a nine-month break from
school, I felt like I knew what kind
of future I wanted to work toward.
I returned to the race, keeping in
mind that the cliche, "the journey
is more importantthan the destina-
tion," is actually pretty true for me.
Don't get me wrong - I'm not advo-
cating for everyone to take time
off school. For many, it may not be
feasible or desired. But as exams
are approaching and the pres-

to slow down.
I came to real-
ize that I had
been living in a
bubble, a world
of ambition and
drive that leaves
little room for
exploration or
self-reflection.

A state elections board approved Right to
Life's proposal Monday because the organi-
zation was able to collect 315,477 signatures.
Now, Michigan's legislature can either review
and vote on the proposal within the next 40
days or allowvoters to decide November 2014.
Given that the number ofsignatures collected
only represents 4 percent of the state's popu-
lation, the process allowed the proposal to
gain too much clout within the legislature,
especially considering how controversial the
proposal is. Last December, Gov. Rick Snyder
vetoed a similar bill, stating at the time that it
"just went too far." Senate Democratic Lead-
er Gretchen Whitmer (D-East Lansing) calls
this proposal "one of the most misogynistic
proposals I have ever seen."
Michigan Right to Life has used the same
method in the past to present their interests
directly to the legislature. Three successful
proposals, passed through the same process,
created a ban on abortion coverage by Med-
icaid for people receiving welfare benefits, a
requirement for teenagers to receive parental
consent for an abortion and a ban on partial-
birth abortions. Former Rep. Bart Stupak, a
Democrat from Michigan, Stupak proposed a
similar amendment that would ban abortion
coverage by plans in the Affordable Care Act
and require people to buy separate policies.
The proposal was not approved, but individ-
ual states are starting to adopt similar regu-
lations. Twenty-three states have already
JACOB LIGHT I

chosen to opt out of the federal requirement
to include abortion coverage in their plans,
and eight of the 23 states have extended the
ban on abortion coverage to include both
public and private plans.
If this privately funded ban becomes law,
then a woman would not be able to receive
coverage for an abortion, even in cases of
rape or incest, with the exception of a life-
risking condition - conditions that led to
Snyder rejecting the original bill. Instead,
specific insurance riders would have to
be purchased before pregnancy that cover
abortion, meaning the added plan requires
people to prepare for unplanned pregnan-
cies and rape - an unreasonable request.
These potential added fees would be a bar-
rier to quality health care for low-income
women and families, preventing them from
gaining appropriate treatment as well as
creating a financial penalty for victims.
Considering the importance of this issue
and the consequences it poses, the proposal
should not go through the state's least demo-
cratic mechanisms. Michigan should not
allow special interest groups to dictate the fate
of health-insurance plans. The legislature has
the ability to push the proposal to the voters
and should do so. Before voting, the legislature
and people need to be aware of the harmful
effects that approving the proposal can create.
Ultimately, the fate of this issue shouldn't be
relegated to four percent of the population.

A program that forgot its fans

Let's build a better Michigan

Four years, sometimes five, sometimes
three. It's not a long time, but it's a time that
we'll remember for the rest of our lives. Yet,
when you arrive at the Big House on gradu-
ation day, the question becomes: What did
this time at the University of Michigan mean?
What will you remember, and how will others
remember you?
Last April, the University of Michigan
Board of Regents approved funding for reno-
vations for the Michigan Unions and Rec-
reation Sports Facilities. Building a Better
Michigan was formed by student leaders to
lead the call for renovations, a call that was
carried forward and advocated through over-
whelming support from the greater student
body. The regents heard students' voices and
approved a major overhaul of buildings cen-
tral to student life at Michigan.
But the buildings are not going to reno-
vate themselves, and the work is just begin-
ning. Starting this winter, the University
will begin the first stage of its renovations
on Mitchell Field and the Commons Cafe in
Pierpont Commons. Meanwhile, the Univer-
sity will choose architects and designers to
implement the renovations. Now, more than
ever, it's important to make students' voices
heard to ensure that the multi-million dollar
renovations reflect the needs and desires of a
diverse cross-section of our student body.
This is where Building a Better Michigan
comes in.
We are building a core of Michigan stu-
dents who will be central in advocating stu-
dents' interests in the renovation process.
With upcoming focus groups and the ini-
tial drafts of building updates starting next
semester, we want to give students a venue
to work with the University to guarantee
that our tuition dollars are spent to satisfy
our needs. Our core will work directly with
University administrators to advise design-
ers, planners, and architects and ensure the
building renovations reflect the priorities of
current and future students. The opportu-
nityto make such a massive and long-lasting
impact on the quintessential University of
Michigan landmark will not be available to
Michigan students again for decades - now

is the time to leave your legacy.
In the coming weeks, Building a Better
Michigan will reach out to students of all
ages, majors and interests to build a Core that
will work with the University throughout the
planning stages of the renovations. We need
strong voices to direct the conversation and
message outward to engage the larger stu-
dent body on the dramatic changes we face
in the coming years. Whether you are a Var-
sity or Club athlete, or if you've walked by the
Central Campus Recreation Building only
once or twice, your input matters. Whether
you're in the Union for meetings every day
or you think of the Union only as a five-story
Wendy's, your input matters.
We want your stories - the good and the
bad. Help us to identify areas of improve-
ment, shortcomings, and structural flaws
that can make the Michigan Unions and Rec-
reation Sports Facilities more inclusive to all
Michigan students. Your experiences will
inform the conversation.
Students interested in joining the Building
a Better Michigan Core are invited to apply
online or e-mail BBMcoreinterest@umich.
edu. The Core will meet regularly through-
out the winter semester to coordinate student
engagement in the renovation project and
craft a cohesive vision for the renovation proj-
ects. We'll be holding our first student town-
hall meeting on Tuesday, Dec. 10, at 6:30 p.m.
to explain the status of the renovation project,
and identify some of the overarching goals
Michigan students hope to achieve through
the Union and CCRB renovations.
We're only given a short period of time
to leave our legacy as Michigan students.
With the overhaul of some of the University
of Michigan's most celebrated hubs of stu-
dent life fast approaching, we're presented
an opportunity to make an impact on future
generations of Michigan Wolverines. Build-
ing a Better Michigan wants your voice to be
heard. Join our Building a Better Michigan
Core, and leave your legacy at the University
of Michigan.

I don't care too much for ham-
burgers. But, like most other good-
doing folks, I do appreciate a good
burger. There are few things better
than chewing into a juicy, medium-
rare beef patty between two sesame
seed buns. Credit given where cred-
it is due.
I also don't care too much for col-
lege football. Nonetheless, one of
the main reasons for my attending
the University was its storied foot-
ball team. Just like a good burger,
good college football is something
worth appreciating, and Michigan
football just sounded like the best
of college football. The winged
helmets, the Big House, Desmond
striking the pose, the rivalry with
Ohio State - it wasn't just college
football. It was Michigan football.
As a senior graduating in a few
weeks, I'm thankful for the Univer-
sity. The opportunity to compete
every day with some pretty bright
kids, a passion for the food indus-
try, a fellowship grant to study
abroad, relationships forged with
both geniuses and goons alike - I
couldn't have asked for much more
from this University.
With that said, Michigan football
has been the single biggest disap-
pointment about life in Ann Arbor.
Of course, the losing sucks. The
unfulfilled promises of Big Ten
championships sting, sure. But
what's worse is the way that our
program continues to rip off its best
consumers: the alumni, the locals
and, most of all, the students.
Again, I'm not going to stand
here and pretend like I'm the big-
gest, most passionate Michigan
Football fan out there. I'm not. But
some students - a lot of students
- absolutely do live and die by the
Team, the Team, the Team.
Take my roommate, Alex. He's a
third-generation Wolverine, and he
doesn't hide it. Both of his parents
have season tickets and have been
taking him to Michigan Football
games since he was in diapers. Leg-
end has it some of his older family

members, in order to stay mentally
sane and keep their hearts healthy,
now refuse to watch the games live.
Rather, they record them, read the
paper the next day and only watch
if Michigan won.
Following, Alex is well on his
way, too. He can't watch enough
YouTube clips of Fielding Yost doc-
umentaries and players from the
70s that I've never heard of. "Hey,
Sems, have you seen this clip of
(insert Michigan legend) from the
1981 Rose Bowl?" After wins, Alex
grabs all of us by the shoulders and
starts belting out the alma mater.
The Victors? The kid was probably
practicing it in his mother's womb.
During close games, he can't help
but get cynical and pessimistic,
always expecting the worst, like a
guy convincing himself that it's OK
that he's about to get dumped by the
love of his life.
Except the love of Alex's life has
been dumping him for years. He just
can't get enough. It's all he's ever
known. No matter how many times
she breaks his heart, he will contin-
ue going to Michigan games. In 10
years, Alex will probably be coming
with his kids as his parents did, sit-
ting in the seats that he was given
with his "seat licensing" donations
to the program. This is the story for
many Michigan students.
All of this love for Michigan foot-
ball, and what does it give back? A
new general-admission policy with
no grandfathering in of current
upperclassmen. Weekly e-mails
imploring students to arrive early
to games so the student section
looks good on TV. Endless in-game
advertisements to purchase season
tickets to other University sports.
And above all, an annual, clock-
work-like increase in ticket prices.
This season, there's a $280 tab for
a seven-game schedule. Compare
that to Michigan State's season
package, which goes for $150, or the
$70 University of Alabama charges
their students. As for Ohio State
University, we finally have them

beat: their student tickets are $252
for the season.
And yet ... the die-hards still
chase true love.
I grew up in Boston. Back there,
rabid Red Sox, Patriots, and other
teams' sports fans live and die by
their sports teams. But the dif-
ference between Boston fans and
Michigan fans is when the Red
Sox started veering off their win-
ning ways last year, fans stopped
going to games. Some would call
this simple economics: When the
product stinks, demand should and
will decrease. But Michigan fans
haven't quit showing up. We con-
tinue to drink the "Most Wins in
College Football History," "127 All-
Americans," "42 Big-Ten Titles"
Kool-Aid even as we rush for
negative 48 yards and get utterly
steamrolled by cross-state "Little
Brother" Michigan State.
Now, I do think the Wolver-
ines are on track to get better.
Better recruits, great coaches
and improving facilities yet again
should mean that my buddy Alex
will have more recent YouTube
clips to watch and should be
attending a Rose Bowl in the near
future. But what if things don't
get better? Why should students
continue to pay five-star steak-
house money for some day old
spicy California rolls from your
local supermarket? Would you pay
another $280 tab for a full-course
Pu Pu Platter of Appalachian State,
Miami (not of Florida), Utah, Min-
nesota, Penn State, Indiana and
Maryland in 2014?
Michigan football is overbought.
It's past its expiration date. Like an
Ann Arbor winter, it is served cold,
dry and tasteless.
So improve the product. Change
the price. Better yet - do both. But
until then, this once historic foot-
ball franchise will just become yes-
terday's leftovers.

Senior defenseman Mac Bennett scored the game-winning goal with less than two minutes remaining after Michigan surrendered a three-goal lead in the third period.
Bennett rescues M' after blown
three-goal lead against Buckeyes

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
Daily SportsEditor
COLUMBUS - If there was
a guide detailing exactly how to
lose a hockey game on the road,
Michigan followed the script
to perfection Monday night at
Value City Arena.
The third-ranked Wolver-
ines (2-0 Big Ten, 10-2-1 overall)
committed an early infraction,
presenting Ohio State with a
prime opportunity to take the
lead. They turned the puck over
several times in the defensive
zone, which forced sophomore
netminder Steve Racine - who
hadn't played in more than two
weeks - into making deft pad
saves. Through the first 14 min-
utes of the game, Michigan had
only one shot to the Buckeyes'
nine.
But with just under six min-
utes remaining in the first peri-
od, forward Boo Nieves fought
for the puck behind the Ohio
State (0-2,8-6) goal and won. The
sophomore dropped a pass into
the slot to junior forward Zach
Hyman, who one-timed a shot
into the net.
The crowd grew silent, and
the cheers from the Wolver-
ines' bench echoed throughout
the cavernous building. It was
Hyman's first goal of the season,
and the game turned with it, as
Michigan eventually won, 5-4.
"It was good for our team,"
said Michigan coach Red Beren-
son. "Their goalie hadn't seen
any action at all. You're lucky
you might have caught him cold.
After that, it was a different
game."
When the first period ended,
Ohio State held a 12-4 advantage
in shots, but Michigan led where
it counted most - on the score-
board -1-0.
The Wolverines looked to
put the game out of reach in the
second period. Freshman cen-
ter JT Compher scored twice on
rebounds, showing off his foot-
work on the first tally by pass-

ing the puck across the crease
to himself with his skate. Three
minutes into the final frame,
freshman defenseman Michael
Downing's pinpoint shot from
the blue line found twine for a
three-goal lead.
But that's when Michigan fell
apart again, making its first peri-
od look exemplary in compari-
son. The Wolverines surrendered
three goals in four minutes, and
Ohio State pulled even.
Racine entered the game
boasting a .931 save percentage,
but the defense in front of him
was porous in the final minutes,
leading to three goals. The Buck-
eyes fired 18 shots in the third
period - more than Michigan
managed in the first two frames
combined.
"We were on our heels,"
Berenson said. "I'mnot sure ifwe
deserved to win the game."
The Wolverines did triumph
thanks to senior defenseman
Mac Bennett, whose gamble paid
off when he pinched and scored
on a simple tap-in. But the game-
winning goal, the series sweep
and the perfect start to Big Ten
play did little to alleviate the
team's frustration.
"The performance in that
third period, me personally, I'm
very upset about it," Bennett
said. "And I'm sure there's a lot
of guys in the locker room that
aren't very happy, either."
Added Compher: "We talked
about burying teams at the end.
When we have the knife to their
throat, putting them away. We
didn't do that tonight."
Michigan's tepid start and late
collapse let Ohio State dig itself
out of a shallow grave, and it very
nearly cost the Wolverines. But
they twice stopped momentum
when it was skewed heavily in
the Buckeyes' favor to escape.
"The best team doesn't always
win," Berenson said. "We got
lucky they didn't score that win-
ning goal. It's as simple as that."
So for tonight at least, it was
better to be lucky than good.

have to make sure that when we

Behind freshman forward JT
Compher's two goals in the sec-
ond period, the Wolverine offense
looked re-energized and poised to
leave without being threatened.
Compher now has five goals
in the past five games after scor-
ing his first on Nov. 15 against
Nebraska-Omaha.
The first goal, by Corphet,
came off a rebound from fresh-
man defenseman Nolan De Jong's
shot near the blue line, nearly one
minute after the Buckeyes tied
the game early in the second peri-
od. His second also came in the
middle frame,
after he took
the puck from

In what was

nated by the
Buckeyes sta-
tistically, the Wolverines couldn't
find a rhythm, nor crash the net
when they did manage to bring
the puck down.
But when sophomore forward
Boo Nieves crashed the boards,
he fed the puck out to junior for-
ward Zach Hyman waiting near
the right circle to score off the

one-timer 14 minutes into the
contest.
Ohio State tied the game early
in the second frame, as the Big
Ten's leading scorer, junior Ryan
Dzingel, tallied his ninth of the
season. Dzingel skated freely to
the right circle where he flipped
the puck past sophomore goal-
tender Steve Racine as a trailing
Sinelli brought him down.
Racine, who saw action for the
first time since he allowed three
goals against Nebraska-Omaha
on Nov. 16, stopped 39 shots to
frustrate the ninth-ranked Buck-
eye offense.
In limited action, Racine has
surrendered three or more goals
three times this season.
"I thought Racine held us in
there," Berenson said. "He made
some key saves late in the game,
but he didn't get a lot of support
tonight."
Downing's shot near the point
early in the third period looked to
have sealed the game for Michi-
gan. His goal also was the first
from a defenseman this season
before Bennett's late in the game.
Ohio State's Max McCormick
started the late charge with his
shot from the slot to beat Racine
glove side before David Gust and
Tanner Fritz knocked in the sec-
ond and third goals just minutes
later.
The Buckeyes tied it up nearly

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Junior forward Zach Hyman scored his first goal of the season Monday night.

No coaching changes in the works, Hoke says

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
A little before 5 p.m. Satur-
day, Al Borges emerged from the
Junge Family Champions Center
adjoining Michigan Stadium, tot-
ing a suitcase
on wheels. His NOTEBOOK
offense just had
likely its best performance of the
year in a heartbreaking 42-41 loss
to Ohio State. His game plan and
play calling had been immaculate.
Dressed in a suit, he walked
through the parking lot and away
from the stadium. Many won-
dered if he would return there
again, at least as Michigan's offen-
sive coordinator.
On Monday, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke seemed to provide the
answer.
"I anticipate the staff (return-
ing)," Hoke told reporters after
an event at Detroit's Ford Field,
according to multiple reports.
Asked to clarify if that meant no
coaching changes, Hoke said that
is "correct."
Under Borges this season,
Michigan's offense sputtered
often, especially on the ground.

The running game was second to
last in the Big Ten. It rushed for
negative yardage in back-to-back
games. A young offensive line sur-
rendered sacks by the dozen that
left redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner hobbled at the
end of games. That led to specula-
tion that Hoke or Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon could make a
change.
Last week, after rumors ques-
tioning Hoke's job security caused
star recruit Jabrill Peppers to re-
open his recruitment, Brandon
issued a statement of support for
Hoke. He also mentioned defen-
sive coordinator Greg Mattison by
name. Borges, though, was absent.
"The transformation and
improvement of our defense under
the leadership of coach Greg
Mattison has been outstanding,"
Brandon wrote. "Our coaches
have worked hard to blend and
develop schemes that bridge the
gap between what was previously
done and what they ultimately
hope to run on both sides of the
ball."
Hoke will evaluate his person-
nel and staff at some point before
Michigan's bowl game or in the

offseason. Brandon has said he
will do the same.
But when asked whether
the coaching staff decision was
a "we'll-see situation," Hoke
replied, "No."
BIG TEN AWARDS: Turns out,
the Big Ten voters had just as
much trouble figuring out wheth-
er sophomore Devin Funchess
is a tight end or wide receiver as
opposing defenses did.
Funchess won the Kwalick-
Clark Tight End of the Year award
and was named an All-Big Ten
selection by the media. The coach-
es, though, put him on the second
team, behind Iowa's C.J. Fiedoro-
wicz. Funchess had 47 receptions
for 727 yards and six touchdowns.
Fiedorowicz had 26 receptions for
253 yards and six touchdowns. It is
likely he suffered from the confu-
sion over his position.
Funchess was one of several
Wolverines to earn postseason
honors. Fifth-year senior tackle
Taylor Lewan also won an indi-
vidual award, the Rimington-Pace
Offensive Lineman of the Year. He
was a consensus All-Big Ten selec-
tion.
Fifth-year senior Jeremy Gal-

Ion was named to the second-team
All-Big Ten by both the coaches
and media, behind Wisconsin's
Jared Abbrederis and Penn State's
Allen Robinson.
Redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner and fifth-year
senior kicker Brendan Gibbons
were honorable mention All-Big
Ten by the media.
On defense, redshirt sopho-
more Blake Countess was an All-
Big Ten selection by the media and
a second-team All-Big Ten selec-
tion by the coaches.
Junior defensive end Frank
Clark was named to the second-
team All-Big Ten by the coaches.
Clark, senior defensive tackle
Jibreel Black and junior corner-
back Raymon Taylor received an
honorable mention by the media.
NOTES: After the event at Ford
Field, Hoke said Gardner will
return next year. ... The Big Ten
conference won't suspend Ohio
State starting right guard Mar-
cus Hall, the conference said in a
statement. Hall, and an additional
player from each team, was ejected

1. This team isn't in rebuilding
mode.
Someone forgot to tell the
women's basketball team that
this was supposed to be a transi-
tion year. Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico used the phrase
"transition season" all through-
out the summer, as lip service to
say the team wasn't expected to
be competitive. But after post-
ing a 5-3 record, the Wolverines
are more than ready to follow up
Barnes Arico's impressive first
year as head coach.
Michigan lost five seniors,
including four starters, and more
than 80 percent of its offense
from last season. But it's com-
pensating by playing strong team
basketball and finding offensive
production up and down the ros-
ter.
"On game day, we always have
a lot of energy, and that's impor-
tant," said freshman guard Siera
Thompson. "We practice really
hard and are always ready for
game day."
Hard work has been a staple
of Barnes Arico's program since
she took over. She often cites her
squad as the hardest working
team in America. And it's largely
due to work ethic that the Wol-
verines have been able to make
up for their lack of size and inex-
perience.
2. The Wolverines can run with
the big dogs.
Michigan faced its first ranked
opponent of the season on Satur-
day when it lost to No. 15 Louisi-
ana State, 64-62. The Wolverines
trailed by seven at halftime, but
they fought back. A second-half
surge had Michigan tied with
LSU (6-1) with 20 seconds left,
but a Tiger tip-in broke the stale-
mate and ended the game.
What made the game even
more impressive was the absence
of the leading scorer, junior-
transfer guard Shannon Smith,
who sat out the game after hurt-
ing her back in Friday's win
over Texas Tech. Losing Smith's
17.3 points per game is a lot to
overcome, especially against a
top-20 team, but four other play-
ers scored in double-digits and
Michigan's defense stepped up
to contain LSU.
With four Big Ten teams
ranked in the Top 25, the Wol-
verines will face their share of
ranked opponents before the
season ends. Michigan also has
a date with No. 5 Notre Dame on
Dec. 14.
But after their performance
against the Tigers, the Wolver-
ines have given every indication
that they can run with ranked
opponents.
3. Siera Thompson is no one-hit
wonder.
The freshman point guard
has started all but one game for
Michigan and has been a force in
the last three games. Thompson
is second on the team in scoring

with 14 points per game, while
also averaging 4.5 rebounds. But
in the last three games, Thomp-
son has averaged 19.7 points per
game and set her career high
twice in that span.
"In the beginning of the year,
she (was) struggling (and) kind
of hit the wall a little bit," Barnes
Arico said. "But we've been
spending some extra time talk-
ing to her, encouraging her. She's
really-responded the last couple
games and found her stride."
But Barnes Arico isn't sur-
prised by Thompson's produc-
tion.
She was the leading scorer
over the summer when the team
played three games overseas
during its trip to Europe.
"Overseas this summer, she
was incredible," Barnes Arico
said. "(During one game) she
was 7-for-9 from three. And I
picked on her after, saying, 'Are
you going to be a one-hit won-
der? I mean, you can't repeat this
performance.' And we had three
games over there, and she did it
every game."
4. Michigan isn't dependent on
one scorer.
At the beginning of the sea-
son, all signs pointed to Shan-
non Smith as the team's only big
scorer. But through eight games
that hasn't been the case. The
Wolverines found contributors
throughout their lineup - four
players average double-digit
points, and 12 players have seen
the court this season.
Thompson has become an
unexpected difference maker for
Michigan and has joined Smith
as the go-to scorer.
Additionally, junior forward
Cyesha Goree has played an
invaluable role for the Wolver-
ines, averaging 10.9 points on
62-percent shooting and seven
rebounds per game. Goree has
started all eight games and has
been critical to the team's suc-
cess.
Michigan also has junior
forward Nicole Elmblad, the
team's only returning starter,
and sophomore guard Madison
Ristovski, who average 12.3 and
9.3 points per game, respectively.
Elmblad, the team's lone cap-
tain, also leads the team with
nine rebounds and 4.6 assists per
game.
The Wolverines' ball move-
ment and team offensive suc-
cess has made up for their small
lineups and inexperience and is
a big reason they are sitting two
games above .500.
5. Bold Prediction: Michigan will
make the NCAA Tournament.
Sure it's a long way off, but
the Wolverines have shown that
they can play with Big Ten oppo-
nents and compete in the confer-
ence. Early season predictions
pinned Michigan as a team that
could miss out on the NIT Tour-
nament, but early season pro-
duction could set Michigan up to
finding its way to a third straight
NCAA Tournament berth by the
end of the season.

INE ARiTS NOTEBOOK
Evolution of street art

By GILLIAN JAKAB
Daily Arts Writer
Is street art a genre of art histo-
ry to be preternaturally preserved
in museums for millennia or is
it more like the sand art of Bud-
dhist monks, matter-of-factly scat-
tered to the next wind in cycles of
rebirth? Sistine Chapel or Snap-
chat?
Banksy, "nom-de-tagueur" of
the world's most famous unidenti-
fied street artist, amped up the dia-
logue onthe fine art ofgraffiti with
his October "residency" in New
York titled "Better Out Than In."
Banksy's work, like that of many
street artists, challenges the art
world's conventional channels of
trade: galleries and museums. On
West 24th Street in Manhattan,
Banksy "showed" two of his pieces
by hanging them with industrial
chains from an overpass.
Viewers were guided by vel-
vet ropes between orange traffic
cones, and welcomed at a bench
created from a plank of wood rest-
ing on cinder blocks - Banksy had
mocked up a gallery space with
street paraphernalia on a public
thoroughfare in Chelsea's haute
gallerydistrict.
His NYC work included a
stint where a homeless man sold
unidentified pieces of Banksy's art
for laughable fractions of the pric-
es they would fetch in art world
sales.
He placed his final mark in
Long Island City, Queens - home
of 5Pointz, described by its web-
site as "the world's premiere
'graffiti Mecca,' where aerosol
artists from around the globe
paint colorful pieces on the walls
of a 200,000-square-foot factory
building."
5Pointz, whose tag line is "the
Institute of Higher Burning," is
across the street from MoMA-
PSI, the hip outpost of New York's
Museum of Modern Art.
With an art institution in
such close proximity, you'd think
there'd be more advocates for the
preservationist side of the debate.
But the sand art winds were
gathering.
For a few years now, the
Wolkoff family, which owns the
5Pointz factory building, has been
threatening to end the communal,
11-year-old street art space with a
plan to build a high-rise residen-
tial complex. This did not fly with

Unnecessary
follow-ups damage
original's brand
,By ALLEN DONNE
DailyArts Writer
Whether a direct successor
or a continuation of a previous
series, it's always difficult to
judge sequels. While writers
may feel they want to give dedi-
cated fans what they deserve,
sometimes the sequel may taint
how some view the series as a
whole (think "The Matrix" tril-
ogy). It's also difficult to com-
pletely emulate the original
installation, which will cause
critics to claim the sequels are
uncreative. So what exactly
makes for a satisfying sequel?
Here, we will examine the
reception of sequels and spin-
offs and how they are viewed
strictly in television or film.
Perhaps the most relevant,
recent example of a continu-
ation series is "The Legend of
Korra." This past Friday, the
second
season First seen on
conclud-
ed. Whi -he filter

I will not divulge any details
of the season finale, there has
been a disappointing aspect of
the show since its announce-
ment. When "Avatar: The Last
Airbender" released, there was
a certain charm in the art form
and the Chinese-influenced
themes of the show. The series,
had a quaint, traditional feeling
to it with a protagonist that the
viewers learned to empathize
with. As the protagonist Aang
grew, we cheered; when he
struggled, we lamented those
losses.
Unfortunately, "The Legend
of Korra" - while a worthwhile
series - loses much of this influ-
ence. The traditional Chinese-
influenced aspect of the show
has largely disappeared, and the
show progressed towards a '30s
setting. For those watching "The
Legend of Korra" for the first
time, they won't miss the aspects
of its predecessor. Instead, they'll
view the show as a standalone
entity. Those following the series
until its end, though, may feel as
if something is missing. The pro-
tagonist, Korra, ahot-headed and
standoff-ish character, serves
almost as a foil to Aang from the
original series. Having fans accli-
mua te sch na anz-e a ne-

bulent - especially if these fans
are purists. Despite the disjunc-
tion, though, fans still are satis-
fied with the show's direction
and quality, making this a suc-
cessful sequel.
Other shows and films are
not quite as lucky. One of the
most commonly cited examples
is "Scrubs." After NBC's abrupt
cancellation of the show, ABC
picked up the series for a satisfy-
ing conclusion. As much as fans
feared the show would tank,
the season finale lived up to its
expectations and more. What
followed, however, was a train
wreck. With the show's resur-
gence and success, "Scrubs" was
renewed in the form of another
series - after the show had
already been brought to a final
conclusion. The result was a ter-
rible spin-off with few cameos
from the original cast. The hos-
pital-converted-into-medical-
school setting had no relevance
to the charm of the original
series. As a result, the most
recent season is not viewed as a
part of the original series.
The problem of sequels made
for profit becomes a large issue
- especially in the film indus-
try. There doesn't need to be
an explanation to say the "Star
Wars" prequels were a desper-
ate attempt to generate revenue.
And while these directors may
mean well for' their fans, the
viewers' reception is not always
the kindest. Take "Iron Man
2," for instance. No one really
remembers what happened in
the movie. In fact, its storyline
and lack of action clearly indi-
cated that the movie was made
for revenue while "The Aveng-
ers" was being produced. These
sequels are only successful for
the sake of being marketable.
In the larger scheme of things,
they are forgotten and viewed
as a separate body of work.
While it may seem as if I hate
sequels, this is not the case.
For instance, "Toy Story" and
the original "Star Wars" tril-
ogy are great examples of what
sequels can be. Even the pre-
quel to "Monsters Inc." made
me smile over the summer. The
issue. of a sequel, however, is
when it's made for no purpose
other than money. If there is
anything to take away, it should
be that the quality of a sequel
affects how audiences view a
series. If great, the series is a
fluid, enjoyable ride. If terrible,
then it should probably never be
viewed except as an example of
how terrible a movie could be.

way into their HBO film.

TO DAY'S
BEST DEALS,
ALL IN ONE
PLACE.
SAnVN YOU MONEY AND TIME TO CReAM.

The audience is introduced to
each new couple as they climb
into bed, where the rest of the
interview takes place. The foot-
age bounces back and forth
between the 10 couples, each
contributing some version of
the story of how they met, the
nature of their sex lives, their
opinions on marriage and -
most importantly - revealing
the idiosyncrasies that make
their relationships unique.
Most sections of the inter-
view are in a single shot, and the
camera often lingers longer than
what feels appropriate. Given
the explicitness of content in
popular culture today, the audi-
ence should be accustomed to
these kinds of intimate displays.
That being said, the reaction of
listening to these couples talk
about their love for each other
is surprising: Even with all our
exposure to naked bodies, sex
on screen and the often power-
ful drama of fictional lives, the
camera and the audience often
feel intrusive.
Still, this discomfort only
further contributes to the raw-
ness of the film. It is personal
to the point that the viewing
experience almost mimics the
intimacy that we are watch-
ing take place. On top of that,
the film does not manipulate
its subjects or their words into
portraying a single message
or one revolutionary answer
to the meaning of love. It does
not seek to justify its purpose
as a creative work with such a
solution, choosing instead to
remain simple and straight-
forward. "Americans in Bed"
lets the audience be the judge
of such a purpose and the sub-
jects,who often contradict each
other, speak for themselves.
This is extremely refreshing.
The major takeaway from the
film is not particularly novel:
sex and love mean different
things for different relation-
ships, which function in dif-
ferent ways, and that is okay.
Though it seems obvious, in
light of the flood of commen-
tary on "healthy relationships"
today, many people forget this.
The subjects help to remind
the audience that it's okay to
be vocal about their insecuri-
ties and completely honest; "I
thought it was terrible," one
partner said of his first time
with the other, sitting directly
next to him. These individu-
als represent real relationships,
and these real people's stories
sound a lot more similar to our
own than those in the Romantic
Comedy section on Netflix or
Taylor Swift songs. "Americans
in Bed" reveals how love is pret-
ty much never the magical "love
at first sight," and the audience
should find these acknowledge-
ments remarkably comforting.
Even in watching for a few
minutes, these couples might
help to affirm that your rela-
tionship is indeed normal after
all and does not need fixing.
And for the romantics out there,
despite many of the unromantic
details of relationships given
attention by the film, on the
whole, this is as tender as it gets.

The stakes couldn't possibly be
higher - not only does their
relationship put Carrie's job
and Brody's marriage at risk,
it sparks a national security
threat. (You can't say the same
for the main couple on "The
Vampire Diaries," can you?)
And in a show so jam-packed
with action and character, sub-
stance and flash, it says a lot
that Carrie and Brody's sto-
ryline is the most engaging.
Between Brody's PTSD and
secret double life and Carrie's
bipolar disorder, the two are so
terribly dysfunctional that they
compliment each other in the
most destructively perfect way.
Their relationship is a contra-
diction that shouldn't work, but
Danes and Lewis sell it so com-
pletely that you can't help but
root for the doomed pair.
Every time it
starts to slip, it
pulls you right
back in.

"See, I told you I'm famous,"

I cannot stress enough that
the criticisms the second and
third seasons of "Homeland"
have received should be taken
with a grain of salt. Later epi-
sodes definitely had some glar-
ing issues. Especially when the
show strays away from the per-
sonal lives of the CIA operatives
and Brody family and tries too
hard to be a serious spy drama,
the twisty plots can feel a little
heavy-handed. Every villain
the show introduces will pale
in comparison to Abu Nazir, an
obvious (but no less terrifying)
fictionalization of Osama bin
Laden. And the show is at its
most explosive when Carrie and
Brody share the screen, and so
far this season, we haven't been
treated to the legendary Danes-
Lewis chemistry yet.
But every time I am almost
ready to give. up on "Home-
land," I'm sucked back in.
Despite a bit of a drop-off in
quality from its first episodes,
I still trust "Homeland" 's writ-
ers completely. The bipolar
nature of the show makes it
that much more interesting to
watch. The manic energy of its
best moments make up for the
slower parts, and truthfully,
