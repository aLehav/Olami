Researchers

By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
Yesterday the- University
announced it will contribute a
line of human embryonic stem
cells to the U.S. National Insti-
tutes of Health registry as part
of a continuing effort to develop
treatments for life-threatening
diseases.
For the past two weeks, the
University has been' finalizing
plans to make the line available
nationally. This will be the Uni-
versity's first national addition
to the registry since Michigan
voters approved a constitutional
amendment allowing research
on surplus embryos unfit for
reproduction in 2008. Other
universities, including the Uni-
versity of California, Los Ange-
les, Stanford University and the
University of Connecticut, have
also contributed to the registry.
The NIH registry created
guidelines in July 2009 that

Joint Commission
ends investigation
of hospital after
child porn incident
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily News Editor
The University received
notification Monday that the
Joint Commission - a national
health care accreditation orga-
nization that can take action
when its standards are found
to be out of compliance -
would not take further action
in its review of the University
of Michigan Health System
after the University waited six
months to report the alleged
discovery of child pornog-
raphy on a USB flash drive
belonging to a UMHS resident,
according to Ora Pescovitz,
the University's executive vice
president for medical affairs.
Though Joint Commission
spokesman Bret Coons said
last night that there were no
"updates from the Joint Com-

mission at this time," Pesco-
vitz informed University of
Michigan Health Services
employees via e-mail that the
Joint Commission decided on
Monday to drop the case after
the University released find-
ings from its internal report to
the organization on Friday.
"We learned that the Joint
Commission reviewed our
response to the incident and
our plan moving forward, and
determined that they do not
need to take further action at
this time," Pescovitz wrote in
the e-mail.
Pescovitz also posted the
message to her blog, making
the statement available to the
public.
Last May, a University Hos-
pital employee reported that
Stephen Jenson, a medical res-
ident, was found in possession
of child pornography on a USB
flash drive. After no action was
taken regarding the discovery,
the same employee reported
the claim to the Office of Clini-
cal Affairs in November, who
then contacted the Universi-

Arguing for change

While debate in the form of
heated classroom discussions
and formal competitions are
a major component of Univer-
sity life, Detroit Urban Debate
Education - a student club
and certified non-profit orga-
nization - seeks to expand
educational and debate oppor-
tunities for Detroit high-
school students.
The club travels weekly to
high schools to teach students
the fundamentals of formu-
lating and executing an argu-
ment. According to LSA junior
Miray Karabulut, the club's
assistant director, members
act as assistant coaches by
developing lesson plans, giving
lectures, creating interactive

exercises, performing speed
drills and teaching research
techniques.
Karabulut said most mem-
bers have a background in
debate, however those without
prior experience are encour-
aged to take a suggested sociol-
ogy course to learn the basics.
She stressed the importance of
debate for all students.
LSA sophomore David Seid-
man, a club member, echoed
Karabulut's sentiments and
said being able to effectively
articulate arguments is a valu-
able skill to have at both the
high school and college level.
"We want to make sure that
every one of these kids that
wants to go to college has the

means to succeed in terms of
both presenting a strong appli-
cation, but also, once they're
in college, having the ability
to build on the education they
have from high school," Seid-
man said.
Karabulut said coaching the
students has been a memorable
experience and that she was
surprised by how receptive
the students in Detroit were to
learning more about debate.
"I expected the kids to be
stubborn and opposed to the
activities, but what I found
was that the kids in Detroit
who I was teaching were very
engaged, very interested, very
into learning," Karabulut said.

Gerrymandering to prevent
Texas Republican primary

0

Presidential vote was
planned to take place
on Super Tuesday
SAN ANTONIO (AP) - The
chances of Texas voters having
much influence in the Republican
presidential race faded yesterday,
after a panel of federal judges
acknowledged the state's deep
divisions over political maps had
made it nearly impossible to pre-
serve an April primary.
Delegate-rich Texas was origi-
nallyscheduled tobe apartofnext
month's slate of Super Tuesday
primaries, but the redistricting
clash forced the state to resched-
ule its contest to April 3. With
that date now all but dead too,
elections workers who squeezed
into a packed San Antonio court-
room yesterday advocated a new

date of May 22, which could be
long after Republicans settle on a
nominee to face President Barack
Obama.
One judge questioned whether
the election shouldn't even be
pushed into the summer, and
another spoke like he was losing
patience with a stalemate that'has
kept the state's-election calendar
in limbo.
Despite court-ordered nego-
tiations, the Texas attorney gen-
eral and minority rights groups
suing the state have been unable
to compromise for weeks on tem-
porary voting maps for the 2012
elections. On some maps, only
one disputed district stands in the
way of a deal.
Pointing a finger at the table of
minority rights lawyers, U.S. Dis-
trict Judge Orlando Garcia stern-
ly ordered both sides to return to
court Wednesday with at least

an agreement on the state Senate
boundaries.
"The Senate - get it done,"
Garcia said.
The hearing was then abruptly
adjourned.
Picking a new primary date
won't beso quickly solved. Garcia
and the other two judges on the
panel have not yet officially can-
celed the scheduled April 3 pri-
mary, but that's a mere formality.
U.S. District Judge Xavier
Rodriguez at one point suggested
that June 26 may make the most
sense for the primary elections.
That would make Texas among
the last states inthe nationto hold
a primary but would also ensure
that maps would reflect any Vot-
ing Rights Act issues that a Wash-
ington court is still deciding.
But Democratic and Repub-
lican party officials said they
would prefer a vote in late May.

tary school simply by being on

that he acted in any inappropri-

Vice President Xi
Jinping reunites with
former hosts in Iowa
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -
The last time China's soon-to-be
leader visited Iowa, he slept in a
bedroom with green shag car-
peting and Star Trek character
cutouts on the walls. He ate eggs
with a spoon because his host
forgot the chopsticks.
But apparently Xi Jinping
(shee jeen ping) remembered
the 1985 stay fondly because he
insisted on returning this week
to Muscatine, a small farming
community he toured to learn
about crop and livestock prac-
tices.
Back then, he was a young
Communist Party leader seeking
ideas to help his agriculture-rich
region of northern China. Now
the nation's vice president, he
made certain to add Muscatine
to his jam-packed itinerary so
he could reunite with the same
Americans who showed him
around the region's hog and cat-
tle operations and its abundant
corn and soybean fields.
"I'm flabbergasted that he
would take time out of his busy
schedule and come back to Mus-

catine," said Eleanor Dvorchak,
whose family hosted him for two
nights.
Although Dvorchak and her
husband have since moved to
Florida, they planned to return
today for Xi's hour-long visit, and
several other local farmers and
residents he encountered will be
there, too.
Some local officials were
encouraged that agriculture -
and specifically Iowa agriculture
- was to play such a prominent
part in a trip by the future lead-
er of the world's most populous
country.
"It sends a signal that the new
leader is not a stranger to the
U.S. and that he has experience
and familiarity with America
by reaching right into the heart-
land," said David Shorr, a foreign-
policy specialist at the Stanley
Foundation, a Muscatine-based
nonprofit that focuses on pro-
moting peace and international
relations.
Xi is expected to ascend to
the nation's highest office next
year and could lead China over
the next decade. His schedule
called for him to meetwith Presi-
dent Barack Obama yesterday
in Washington before flying to
Iowa. He'll also stop in California.
China has become an increas-

ingly important trading partner
for the United States. It purchased
$20 billion in U.S. agriculture
exports last year, making it the
top buyer of farm goods.
In 1985, Xi stayed with the
Dvorchaks; their 15-year-old
daughter, and their dog in a
four-bedroom, three-bath ranch
home. The Star Trek-themed
room had been left unchanged
after the couple's sons went to
college.
Eleanor Dvorchak, now 72,
recalled a handsome 31-year-old
man who was calm and intensely
focused on learning as much as
possible during his brief trip. He
kept busy until late each day, so
all he needed when he returned
in the evening was peace and
quiet, she said.
"My job was to provide him
with breakfast and a quiet place
for him to relax and think, to give
him time to pull his thoughts
together for the next day," she
said. "It was just a pleasure to
have him in our home. He was
very undemanding."
The language barrier made
conversation difficult, but Xi was
interested in touring the home
and seemed impressed with the
two-car garage and large con-
crete driveway that had a basket-
ball hoop, she said.

Independent radio
pressured by Putin
The editor of Russia's leading

yesterday that its management
is being changed in an effort to

The media arm of state-con-
trolled natural gas giant Gaz-
prom, which holds two-thirds of

over the board of directors, edi-
tor Alexei Venediktov said.
Gazprom Media took the
action after Prime Minis-
ter Vladimir Putin last month
accused the station of serving
the foreign policy interests of
the United States and "pouring
diarrhea" on him all day. Putin
is seeking to return to the presi-
dency by winning the election.

cow, has long been among the

he seeks re-election

Mourners pray at a funeral for a Syrian rebel the day after he was killed in fighting in Idlib, Syria, on Sunday.
Divided opposition in
Syria gives Assad hope

Free Syrian Army
plans operations
from safehouses in
neighboring states
BEIRUT (AP) - At a rent-
ed house just outside Syria's
border, a dissident known
only as "The Doctor" maps
out attacks. Planners speak
by Skype with fighters on the
ground in Syria, while others
raise money, drumming up
cash from fellow exiles to buy
weapons.
The safe house offers a
glimpse into the Free Syrian

Army, a group of army defec-
tors and others who are trying
to overthrow President Bashar
Assad by force.
The FSA has emerged as a
significant hype for many Syr-
ians who have all but given up
on peaceful resistance against
government tanks and snipers
waging a deadly crackdown
on protesters. But the group
is highly decentralized - and
comprises just one faction in
a deeply divided and fractious
Syrian opposition.
As the West and Arab states
consider offering direct sup-
port to Assad's opponents,
there are serious questions
about whether any opposition

group is even remotely pre-
pared to take the helm after
more than 40 years under
Assad family rule.
Indeed, Assad's greatest
advantage has been the weak-
ness and lack of unity among
the disparate forces opposing
him.
Since the uprising began
in March, a chorus of voices
has risen against the regime.
Besides the rebel fighters,
there are distinguished exiles
who hold little sway back
home, aging dissidents who
spent years locked in Syrian
prisons and tech-savvy young
people desperate to cast off a
suffocating dictatorship.

Sarkozy mum

If polls can be believed, the

combative Sarkozy has stayed
uncharacteristically quiet about
whether he will run. But French
media say he will announce his
candidacy any day - possibly
on national TV today - and are
already reporting the names of
those on his campaign team.
Despite his successes in inter-
national affairs, the conservative
Sarkozy has been unpopular at
home for most of his first term
and has for months trailed
Socialist candidate Francois Hol-
lande in the polls.
"If we look at past elections,
it's off to a very, very, very bad
start," pollster Emmanuel Riv-
iere of TNS Sofres agency said of
Sarkozy's campaign. "Never has
a president been in such a situa-
tion."
A leftist president in France
would not only mark a big shift
for France after 17 years under
conservative rule, but it would
also shake up Europe's political
calculus. The EU's top powers -
Britain, France, Germany, Italy
and Spain - are now either run
by leaders on the right or, in Ita-
ly's case, by a technocratic care-
taker government.
Sarkozy's presidency got off
to a rough start in 2007. Public
gaffes, tax policies that appeared
to favor his rich friends and his
jet-setting courtship of super-
model Carla Bruni all dam-
aged his image in the eyes of
the French. Since then, France's
worst recession since World War
II and a still-weak economy have
made it hard to rebound.
Polls indicate that Hollande
and Sarkozy could finish first and
second in the first-round vote on
April 22 and then go head-to-
head May 6 in the runoff. One poll
last week put Hollande a stagger-
ing 20 points ahead of Sarkozy in

a theoretical second round.
Sarkozy's chances are also
hurt by the increasing rise of far-
right candidate Marine Le Pen,
who has stirred up anti-Islam
sentiment in the country with
Europe's largest Muslim popula-
tion.
This is all assuming Sarkozy
throws his hat in the ring. Most
pundits see it as inevitable but
admit a tactical delay allows him
to hold on to his commander-in-
chief mantle as long as possible
- before morphing into cam-
paigner-in-chief.
"He needs to create a surprise
when he announces his candida-
cy, and it's going to be one of his
last cartridges," Riviere said.
Pollsters at the IFOP agency
noted that Sarkozy is now in
his 49th straight month below a
50-percent approval rating.
Sarkozy's approval rating got
a brief bounce up after a joint
TV interview in November with
President Barack Obama, who
is almost universally adored in
France. But, as in many coun-
tries, foreign affairs tends to take
a back seat to domestic concerns
in France, and Sarkozy has not
appeared to reap benefits of his
unprecedented endorsement
from German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, a fellow conservative and
ally in battling Europe's debt cri-
sis.
Sarkozy's best hope, pollsters
say, is for a flub by Hollande -
who has been visibly cautious
- or something that would turn
attention away from Sarkozy's
divisive personality.
"As long as the election
remains a sort of referendum for
or against Nicolas Sarkozy, pub-
lic opinion is pretty well set,"
Jerome Sainte-Marie, a pollster
at the CSA agency, told BFM-TV.
"But if new themes appear -
notably on issues of values - then
unexpected moves could hap-
pen."
Hollande, a bespectacled
57-year-old, has benefited from
his image as the anti-Sarkozy. A
CSA poll last week found more
than half of respondents said
they'd vote for the Socialist to
reject Sarkozy - with only a
third motivated by Hollande
himself.
Sarkozy's strategy, advisers
say, willibe to cast himself as more
credible, frank and reform-mind-
ed than Hollande amid Europe's
economic uncertainty and able to
learn from his mistakes.
With voters elsewhere in
Europe ousting leaders in elec-
tion after election, Sarkozy could
be the latest highest-profile casu-
alty done in by Europe's persis-
tently high unemployment and
limpng growth rates.

Short-sighted short sales
Wayne County shouldn't sell back properties
The economic downturn has caused many Detroit residents
to lose their homes. Nearly 12,300 Detroit homes faced fore-
closure in 2011. As usual, county officials held auctions for
almost 6,500 homes, but most of these properties didn't find buyers,
leaving Wayne County with empty homes and no one to pay for ser-
vice to them. The Wayne County Treasury is now offering to allow
individuals to keep their foreclosed properties for payments as low
as $500. Wayne County hopes that the new plan will result in addi-
tional tax revenues for the county as well as fewer abandoned homes
and displaced residents. The-solution, however, is a shortsighted fix.
While it will be beneficial to Detroit and its struggling residents
in the short run, the city needs to implement better framework to
address substantial foreclosure woes.

The climate ofhate

*I

The Wayne County Treasury will soon
begin sending representatives door-to-door to
negotiate with residents of foreclosed homes.
These people must provide proof of their
actual residency, but won't have to meet any
other qualifications. They'll be able to retain
ownership of their homes - some for $500,
the starting auction price. In return, they'll
have to allow county officials to monitor their
affairs for two years to ensure they take care
of homes and pay respective taxes.
It's in Detroit's best interest to avoid evic-
tions while addressing vacant properties and
the city's continuing economic struggles.
Forcing those who can't afford to pay taxes to
leave their homes, however, only perpetuates
the cycle of poverty already gripping the city.
Vacant properties remaina serious nuisance.
Abandoned homes not only become eye-
sores, but also sites of illicit activity. They
can foster drug trade and other crimes while
becoming garbage sites that breed pests and
disease. Vacant properties impact the entire
community, reducing its aesthetic appeal and
further lowering property values of nearby
homes.
Keeping homes occupied would potentially
increase revenues for the city, but the plan
alone isn't enough to sustain Detroit. Selling
the homes that have fallen into county owner-
ship for a small sum is better than nothing, but

certainly not much. Last November, Mayor
Dave Bing predicted a deficit of up to $45 mil-
lion in the upcoming year, and the city is cur-
rently working against the bankruptcy clock.
Selling 6,000 homes for a starting bid of $500
will only be a drop in the enormous bucket of
Detroit's economic woes.
The policy points in the right direction:
getting these properties off the city's hands
and providing places to live to those who are
homeless. Bailing out residents by allowing
them to re-buy their homes, however, is unfair
to those who have responsibly paid taxes.
Wayne County's plan sets a dangerous
precedent for abuse of the system. Residents
will have reduced incentive to retain home
ownership with the knowledge the county
will simply sell foreclosed properties back to
the previous owners. This is toxic to a city that
already has trouble collecting taxes and is in
desperate need of revenue.
Wayne County's attempted price fix to
Detroit's massive foreclosure problem is a
weak patch-up. Detroit should resist resorting
to mass evictions, but selling homes for small
change to owners with poor track records
isn't the answer. It will only frustrate resi-
dents who do pay their taxes and encourage
those who don't to continue. Vacant proper-
ties in Detroit need to be addressed, but this
policy isn't the right solution.

policy called "No Homo Promo"
meant the faculty could have con-

secuted students. Their stories are a
poignant reminder that to be young
and different in the United States
can mean years of silent suffering.
Terrible things happen when the
politics of intolerance and revenge
intersect with the short-sighted,
cruel teen world.
When tragedy occurs we search
for people to blame. Sometimes,
that search produces clear evidence
of wrongdoing and culpability. At
other times, the search for respon-
sibility leads to a tangle of intercon-
necting causes. In such cases, our
institutions are rarely able to sort
things out appropriately. Such is the
case with the trial of Dharun Ravi,
a former Rutgers University student
whose roommate, Tyler Clementi,
killed himself last fall.
A few days before Clementi died,
Ravi had used a webcam to watch
him embrace another man in the
room they shared. Two days before
Clementi took his own life, Ravi tried
to watch another encounter between
Clementi and the same man. Nothing
was recorded; no one saw anything
pornographic, and Clementi had
been open about his sexual orienta-

tion before the webcam viewings.
Press reports claimed that Ravi post-
ed a compromising video to YouTube
and outed Clementi - those reports
were mistaken.
Activists who believed the inac-
curate reports pressured New Jer-
sey officials into charging Ravi with
invasion of privacy and "bias intimi-
dation," a hate crime. Had Clementi
not taken his own life, Ravi would
almost certainly have been disci-
plined by Rutgers, notthe state.
The claim that Ravi's actions
were motivated by homophobia
rests on shaky ground. The most
important evidence was his use of
anti-gay slurs to insult heterosexual
friends on Twitter and iChat - a far
cry from the systematic abuse that'
"bias intimidation" was created to
punish.
It's almost impossible to under-
stand what specific events moti-
vate someone to take his or her
own life. Most suicides take root
in deep, long-term suffering - they
are the result of abuse, depression
or personal tragedy. In many cases,
mental state matters more than
individual events. Ravi is on trial
because activists, the press and the
state of New Jersey have assumed
that the webcam incident, occur-
ring days before Clementi died, was
the cause of Clementi's death. The
facts that have been made public do
not provide clear support for that
thesis.
We should be wary of any expla-
nation of a suicide that hinges on
assumptions about the victim's
mental state. If Clementi had left a
note saying that he had jumped from
NewYork City's GeorgeWashington
Bridge because Ravi had spied on
him, would it be trustworthy? How
would we know that his transition
to college, the stress of coming out
to his family a few weeks prior or
any of the other things that can hap-
pen to a young man in his first weeks

away from home didn't play into his
unfortunate action? The lack of a
convincing answer suggests that
jailing his former roommate and
possibly deporting his family - the
Ravis are citizens of India - is the
wrong response.
We search for
people to blame
for tragedies.
Implicit in the mistaken assump-
tion that Clementi was ashamed
of having been outed is a sad fact
about life in America today: Mil-
lions of people are ashamed about
who they are. That shame exists
because of people like the preachers
in Anoka who, on Sundays, teach
the bigotry that students bring to
school on Monday..
Unlike Clementi, the Anoka
students who died suffered ter-
rible, systematic abuse. They bore
it for years while the school district
kept its staff from doing anything
to help. The Anoka students who
abused others, the administrators
who abetted them and the preach-
ers who fostered a climate of hate
should bear the blame. It was this
climate of hate - not a single event
- that drove the victims to despair.
In a just world, those responsible
would be punished, while those
whose role is unclear, like Ravi,
would not. In a better world, hatred
wouldn't exist at all, and none of
these young people would have lost
their lives.

TO THE DAILY:
In his letter to The Michigan Daily, Eric
Zech describes enjoying his working rela-
tionship with his adviser. It's his right to
admire her - many GSRAs who are active in
GEO experience the great working relation-
ships that define collaboration in research at
its finest.
We take Zech at his word when it comes
to his assertion of independent action, but
personal attacks that appear to have the tacit
support of a faculty member create a climate
of fear and stifle open debate. The mounting
attacks on Jennifer Dibbern exemplify the

fearful tactics of union-busters who oppose
not just unionization, but the right of GSRAs
to choose for ourselves.
The replacement of democratic debate
with diversionary character attacks doesn't
befit the University of Michigan - it's sadly
one of the oldest tricks in the history of cor-
porate union-busting.
We want to proceed with an expedit-
ed, free and fair union election conducted
under the auspices of the Michigan Employ-
ment Relations Commission. We urge those
opposed to our organizing to trade in their
character attacks for the democratic debate

resenting Valentine's Day - the day love is

girls, who wear dresses and like pink, and
boys, who do not wear dressesand like blue.
In what kind of time is the Daily existing
if they think that these stereotypes actually
hold true? In an attempt to avoid a passive-
aggressive conclusion, I suggest simply this:
please be more conscientious of things like
this - for the sake of equality, justice and
respect for your audience.


Our student government ought to be a vibrant inter-
section of student voices and an advocate for change
on campus. The Central Student Government should,
use its access and influence to improve the lives of stu-
dents. By uniting student leaders from across campus
and pushing to make our university moreaccessible,
CSG can ensure that the leaders and best from all over
the world have an equal opportunity to attend, not just
those who can most easily afford it. Unfortunately,
too many currently in student government substitute
speech for action and resolutions for change.
Our campus deserves better, which is why we're run-
ning for president and vice president of Central Student
Government.
It's also why we decided to start the OurMichigan
coalition, a diverse group of student leaders who are
committed to refocusing the role of student govern-
ment. We know that CSG can do better because we'ye
seen what students can do when they work together
to fight for change. Public Policy junior Kevin Mersol-
Barg co-founded the Coalition for Tuition Equality,
which advocates for greater college accessibility for all
Michigan high school graduates. He brought together
hundreds of students, faculty and administrators to
demonstrate broad support for this new policy. LSA
junior Amy Navvab is leading the Open Housing Initia-
tive. Under her direction, the initiative worked success-
fully wit'h the University to expand housing options
for transgender and gender non-conforming students,
ensuring more students a safe and welcoming living
experience on campus.
These experiences have motivated us to run for
president and vice president of CSG. Having worked in
grassroots campaigns during our time at the University,
we see the potential of CSG and, more importantly, we
see the ways in which CSG falls short. One area where
CSG has failed to act is in promoting a more afford-
able college experience. As student body president and
vice-president, we will work with students and fight to
ensure that the University is more accessible.

First, we will stand strongly against further tuition
hikes. Unlike the past several CSG administrations, *
however, we will go beyond rhetoric by building a coali-
tion of concerned students and student organizations
to amplify our message. We know how to unite student
leaders across campus to create change, and we know
how to make administrators listen.
But combating rising tuition, while important, is not
enough; we must work to ensure that college life is more
affordable as well. Students struggle to afford the neces-
sities of attending college. Textbook costs are climbing,
food prices are eating away at disposable income and
housing options remain out of reach for many. Students
ought to have a role in making our city an affordable place
to live, and we need a student government that will bring
students together to amplify our voices.
In order to achieve these goals, CSG needs to change
how it operates, a change we know is worth making.
But we can't do that alone. Our work outside of student
government tells us that students are only successful
when we bring together a wide and diverse array of
voices. The perspectives, ideas and talents of students
and student organizations enable us to identify creative
solutionsto immense challenges.
That's where you come in. We're looking for passion-
ate leaders who will work hard to make CSG a stron-
ger voice for students. If you're interested in getting
involved or running with us, please e-mail.OurMichi-
gan@umich.edu.
We know this work will be difficult. CSG has paid lip
service toward meaningful change in the lives of stu-
dents for too long. Our experience outside of CSG tells
us this doesn't have to be the case. Students and student
government have tremendous potential if we can bring
people from all over campus together to advocate for
one another. While difficult, we know this is a change
worth making.

TO THE DAILY:
This morning, I noticed, with a sort ofrevolt-
ed surprise, two figures standing atop the front
page of The Michigan Daily. In one corner, a
standard outline of what generally represents a

that appears to be wearing a dress.
These are your typical, governmentally-
regulated symbols for male and female, most
commonly denoting which bathroom is for
which gender. My disgust, however, came

deteriorated," Neville-Andrews
said. "It's alot of fun (seeing the)
backstage. It's a lot of miming,
because obviously they can't
talk, so it's a lot of people walk-
ing around doing things with-
out talking. It's rather funny
because then another actor gets
involved, people are throwing
things at each other, and some-
one's always trying to find the
whiskey bottle."
Despite having taken part in
a multitude of other plays and
performances, Neville-Andrews
remains loyal to "Noises Off,"
and he said this play was one of
his favorites to direct.
"I always come back to this
play, even though it's incredibly
difficult - the timing, the pre-
cision. It needs to be extremely
precise or it doesn't hold togeth-
er," he said.
The difficulty of "Noises Off,"
according to Neville-Andrews,
comes from its dual-acting, its
set and its comedic timing. Each
actor must play two characters,
so they're essentially putting on
two plays. This entails a preci-
sion in all comedic interludes
and nuances so as not to confuse
the audience. The set, composed
of a split level and seven doors,
requires navigational timing as
well as quick spatial recogni-
tion.
"We were fortunate in that

they built the set for us early
and we were able to work on
the set from day one," Neville-
Andrews said. "Actors can't
really rehearse this play with
the take on the floor."
Despite the play being in 1982
- the time' it originally ran -
Neville-Andrews emphasized
that the comedy translates eas-
ily and audiences today will
enjoy it as much as in the past.
"We're going back in time to
where things are very different,
but it is an out-bound comedy
which is something important
and rare this day and age in
theater," Neville-Andrews said.
"We (as an audience) are not
being asked to think a great
deal. We're being asked to col-
laborate and enjoy what we see
in front of us."
Neville-Andrews added that
theater comedy provides audi-
ences with something that they
wouldn't be able to get from a
movie or Netflix binge, provid-
ing a live connection in which
audience members are able to
interact with the show on stage.
"You're obviously making a
contribution when you're in the
theater. Here (in the theater) we
can make them cry, make them
feel mad or make them laugh
their backsides off," Neville-
Andrews said. "There's contact
between the theater people and
the audience, which always has
to be taken into consideration."


Conference to investigate

tion.
But for some people, dance
- especially ballet - can be an
intimidating practice. With this
in mind, the "Meanings and Mak-
ings of Queer Dance" conference
was established to help alleviate
the pressures of traditional bal-
let classes for LGBT individuals,
as well as to explore the ways in
which dance and gender relate to
each other on a larger scale.
"Meanings and Makings of
Queer Dance" is a special-topics
conference led by the Congress
on Research in Dance, a non-
profit organization focused on
uniting dance professionals. The
conference will bring individu-
als involved in LGBT studies and
dance studies together in Ann
Arbor to see how the two disci-
plines can work with and benefit
from each other. Developed by co-
chairs Clare Croft and Peter Spar-
ling, the conference will showcase
performers, panels, workshops,
movies and discussions on dance
and gender relations.
Croft, a School of Music, The-
atre & Dance associate professor
and post-doctoral fellow in dance,
said she was inspired by two previ-
ous conferences at the University,
"Queer Shame" and "Doing Queer
Studies Now." She wanted to host
the conference to start a dialogue
about the place of gender in dance

At first, I was skeptical: Con-
sidering my already-draining
love affair with T, I wasn't too
excited by the prospect of add-
ing another show to my weekly
lineup. But after serious thought
and even more serious pressure
from friends, I heeded the siren
call of a lazy weekend and began
watching "Game of Thrones."
Before starting the now-infa-
mous HBO series, I was young,
naive. I wasn't prepared for the
in-depth soul-searching that
would result from hours of a
nonstop "Thrones" marathon.
For others coming into the game
late, a warning: there are spoil-3
ers below. .
The first episode started inno-
cently enough: a mass murder
of wildlings (the northernmost
human inhabitants in the world
of "Game of Thrones"). And then
a few men of a special guard, the
Night's Watch, are killed by said
"murdered" wildlings - though
one guard was spared for rea-
sons unknown. Then, Eddard
Stark (Sean Bean, "Lord of The
Rings"), lord of the northern
state of Winterfell, kills that lone
survivor for deserting. It was an
eventful 15 minutes.
I was overwhelmed not only
by the amount of action, but by
how quickly the series had estab-
lished death as a major motif.
Throughout ensuing episodes,
characters die left and right:
people you want to see live, sol-
diers who don't deserve to be
axed, honorable men and women
who fight for their beliefs. You
can't assume main characters
are untouchable: No one is safe.

A school board meeting at the Anoka County School District headquarters in Coon Rapids, Minn. on Monday. A new policy
commits the district to providing "a safe and respectful learning environment for all students."
New policy requires teachers to
respect all sexual orientations

After controversy,
Minnesota school
board alters stance
COON RAPIDS, Minn. (AP)
- Leaders in Minnesota's larg-
est school district said the long
debate over how teachers should
handle discussions about sexual
orientation probably had a bigger
impact than a new policy will.
The Anoka-Hennepin School
District replaced a policy requir-
ing teachers to be neutral in dis-
cussions about sexual orientation
with a new one requiring them to
foster a respectful learning envi-
ronment for all students.
The change came after six
students in the Anoka-Hennepin
School District committed sui-
cide in less than two years. Some
had been bullied, and some were
either gay or seen as gay.
Julie Blaha, president of the
district teachers union, said the
debate over the old policy, which
was blamed for contributing to
the harassment of gay students,
may prove to be more important
than the new policy itself.
"It's got people thinking about,
'OK, what am I going to do in my
classroom differently?' ... We're
all thinking aboutthis more deep-
lynow," Blaha said.
The policy adopted Monday
night says teachers shouldn't try
to persuade students to adopt a
particular viewpoint when con-
tentious political, religious, social
or economic issues come up. It

calls for teachers instead to foster
respectful exchanges that affirm
the dignity and self-worth of all
students, regardless of race, reli-
gion, gender or sexual orienta-
tion.
The old policy said sexual ori-
entation wasn't part of the cur-
riculum and was best addressed
outside the schools, but teachers
should to stay neutral if it came
up in student-led discussions. The
policy had strong support from
some conservatives who believe
homosexual conduct is immoral
and don't want public schools to
teach their children it isn't, but it
also led to two lawsuits alleging
the policy was a gag order that
prevented teachers from taking
effective action against bullying.
Anoka High School senior
Rachael Hawley, who led a peti-
tion drive that collected more
than 350 signatures from stu-
dents opposed to the neutrality
policy, said she's not certain the
new policy will make a big differ-
ence because some teachers could
still feel constrained.
"Hopefully it will open the
door to more discussion," Hawley
said. "I think that would be the
best difference right now."
While the district's intdrnal
investigation found no evidence
that bullying contributed to the
suicides, the district amended its
anti-bullying policies in October
2010 to clearly state that harass-
ment or bullying of gay students
would not be tolerated.
The new policy may help clear
the way for a settlement in the

lawsuits, which were filed last
July by students and former stu-
dents who contend the district
failedto protect them from severe
physical and verbal abuse.
"The repeal of this policy is an
important first step, but the Dis-
trict must do much more to create
a safe, welcoming, and respect-
ful learning environment for all
students, including LGBT and
gender non-conforming students,
and those perceived as such,"
said a statement from the South-
ern Poverty Law Center and
the National Center for Lesbian
Rights, which are representing
the plaintiffs.
The original lawsuits sought
not only an end to the neutral-
ity policy but asked the court to
award unspecified cash damages
and order more effective protec-
tions, such as better training.
Both sides have been keeping the
settlement discussions confiden-
tial. U.S. Magistrate Judge Steven
Rau has scheduled the next round
for March land 2.
Superintendent Dennis Carl-
son and Blaha said they expect
long discussions ahead as admin-
istrators and teachers figure out
what the new policy means in
practice.
District spokesman Brett
Johnson said yesterday that
teachers are already trained to
manage classroom discussions.
"You're going to have times
when kids go off topic and you've
got to get them refocused. That's
a basic teaching skill," Johnson
said.

During her testimony, Larsen
said Murray was paid $12,700
for work ahead of the Huta-
ree investigation. She said he
attended meetings of at least
one other militia but there were
no indications of illegal activity.
Larsen said the FBI removed
Murray from the Hutaree in
January 2010, more than two
months before charges were
filed, because an undercover
agent had been securely planted
inside the group.
Murray had his own prob-
lems in February of that year
when he fired a gun toward his
wife and, in a separate incident,
attempted suicide, according to
court records. Defense lawyers
have suggested that the infor-
mant's personal problems may
have motivated the government
to round up Hutaree members,
not because of some threat
against police as authorities
have insisted.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Shel-
don Light told the judge there's
no evidence that the govern-
ment intervened with local
prosecutors to help Murray.

No suspect after justice robbed by

Local gov't officials
assure island is safe
after items stolen
from Stephen Breyer
BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP)
- The head of the local govern-
ment in Nevis sought yesterday
to assure the public that the
island is safe despite the fact
that U.S. Supreme Court Jus-
tice Stephen Breyer was robbed
in his vacation home by a man
wielding a machete.
Nevis Premier Joseph Parry
said police are taking the mat-
ter seriously and he said that

he visited Breyer at his home
the day after Thursday night's
attack.
"The police have been very
much involved from the very
beginning," Parry said in an
interview with radio station
WINN 98.9 in the capital of St.
Ritts. "I am satisfied that the
police have been doing every-
thing within their power to
deal with the situation."
A government official said
that authorities have a sus-
pect but no one has yet been
detained. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity because
he was not authorized to reveal
information about the inves-
tigation. The government of

formal statement later.
The .73-year-old Breyer,
his wife Joanna and guests
were confronted by the robber
around 9 p.m. EST Thursday
in the home Breyer owns on
the Caribbean island of Nevis,
Supreme Court spokeswoman
Kathy Arberg said. The intrud-
er took about $1,000 in cash
and no one was hurt.
The U.S. Marshals Service,
the FBI and the Supreme Court
Police are assisting the inves-
tigation, officials said. FBI
spokesman Paul Bresson said
no one has been arrested.
"It's still an ongoing investi-
gation," he said.
Breyer reported on his most
recent annual disclosure in June
that property he owns on Nevis
is worth between $100,000 and
$250,000. The home is in the
hills in the Golden Rock area of
the island, which home to nearly
13,000 people.
Breyer has kept a low-profile
in Nevis and few people in the
country were apparently aware
he frequents the island.
Parry noted that tourism is
important to the local economy
and he appealed for witnesses or
anyone else with information to
come forward.
"I want to appeal to the pop-
ulation that we need to be very
careful how we conduct our-
selves," he said. "I want to make
an appeal to the people of Nevis

There are currently 147 stem cell
lines on the registry.
Gary Smith, co-director of the
A. Alfred Taubman Consortium
for Stem Cell Therapies, started
work on the line in October 2010.
Smith said development of the
line setsthe Universityapartfrom
other major research institutes.
"I do believe it makes us
unique in comparison to many
other universities," Smith said.
"It does put us in a handful of
universities across the Unites
States (that have contributed to
the registry)."
The line was created from a
five-day-old embryo approxi-
mately the size of a period, which
would have been discarded
because it was not fit for implan-
tation. The cells will be used to

will be announced Sunday at
a launch party for the group, and
the party will nominate candi-
dates for CSG's Student Assem-
bly in March, Mersol-Barg said.
Mersol-Barg said the two
major points of the OurMichi-
gan platform are furthering
accessibility to the University by
preventing tuition increases and
increasing student advocacy.
"You need to be empowering
minority students to affect the
change they want to see and not
just passing a resolution saying,
'We're helping students,' because
that's not enough," he said. "That
may be symbolic, but it is not
helping the many students that
need it."
Navvab said the campaign is
strengthened by her and Mersol-
Barg's experiences and relation-
ships outside of CSG.
"Kevin and I both have prac-
tical experience uniting student
leaders outside of Central Student
Government," Navvab said. "I'm
excited that for our campaign,

how certain diseases form and to
design treatments and cures for
those diseases, Smith said.
The line is genetically nor-
mal, but University researchers
are working to develop two dis-
ease-specific lines, Smith said.
Researchers are also working on
eight others - five of which will
be genetically normal. I
Sue O'Shea, the other co-
director of the Consortium, said
in a press release the combina-
tion of the two types of stem cell
lines will open up a wide range of
possibilities in disease research.
"We envision inthe futurethat
investigators will be able to use
the genetically normal embry-
onic stem cell lines ... together
with disease-specific embryonic
stem cell lines, asa model system
to investigate what causes these
diseases and come up with treat-
ments," O'Shea said.
Eva Feldman, director of the
A. Alfred Taubman Medical
Research Institute, said in the

press release the breakthrough
of the developing lines offers
additional opportunities to find
cures to diseases.
"This is another major step
forward for medical science in
Michigan," Feldman said. "This
opens up another avenue for
researchers to reallybegin explor-
ing the causes and progression of.
those diseases, with the ultimate
goal of finding new therapies for
patients."
A. Alfred Taubman, founder
and chair of the Taubman Insti-
tute, added in the press release
that the recent stem cell prog-
ress is monumental for the Uni-
versity's research programs.
"I consider stem cells to be
a modern miracle - the most
exciting advance in medicine
since antibiotics," Taubman
said. "The progress we have
made throughout the state in
stem cell research has been
nothing short of remarkable."

University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the Joint Com-
mission's announcement is a
positive step forward in the
case, and follows the Univer-
sity's compliance in launching
an internal investigation , the
results of which were released
on Friday.

"We did exactly what the
Joint Commission asked us to do,
and they're satisfied with that
response, and that's certainly
good to know," Fitzgerald said.
The Joint Commission can
consider complaints with com-
pliance standards in the future

Pescovitz mentioned her plan
for the future hospital security
protocol in an e-mail, which
was also outlined in the internal
report compiled by the Univer-

sity Audit office and released on
Friday. The report recommend-
ed that a shared communication
system be developed between
DPS and UMHS to increase
accountability.
The report also suggested that
increased team building efforts
be created to fostertransparency
between the departments. Addi-
tionally, it recommended that
the culture within the health
system be modified through
cooperation between outside
experts and security leaders.

Mersol-Barg was one of five
candidates seeking MForward's
nomination, but he lost to Aditya
Sathi, MForward's candidate
and the current vice speaker of
the CSG Student Assembly, who
is the only other candidate to
announce a run for the presiden-
cy. He said his decision to launch
a new party was not to spite his
former party.
"I think that this is beyond
politics," he said. "This is about
what's best for students ... After
two years, MForward has really,
become institutionalized. It's
substituting speech for action
and resolutions for change. We
are going to take a new approach
to this."
Mersol-Barg added that
though MForward's nominations
were only 11 days ago, he had con-
templated running outside of the
party for several weeks.
Since transferring to the Uni-
versity from Michigan State Uni-
versity in fall 2010, Mersol-Barg
said he has been involved with
Human Rights Through Educa-

tion and the University's chap-
ter of College Democrats. He
currently serves as chair of the
Communications Commission of
CSG and has continued to work
towards tuition equality, which
would allow undocumented stu-
dents who have attended school
and lived in Michigan to receive
in-state-tuition.
In support of his cause, Mer-
sol-Barg founded the Coalition
for Tuition Equality, a group that
has invited the Pulitzer Prize-
winning journalist and undocu-
mented immigrant Jose Antonio
Vargas to campus on Feb. 22.
Mersol-Barg said he chose to
work outside of CSG's typical
settings to utilize resources that
would allow for more outreach to
the campus community.
"I worked with the Peace
and Justice Commission on fair

ment and the way MForward

ROMNEY
From Page 1A
Michigan's Democratic Party,
said inthe conference call that the
op-edeupset many state officials.
"All of us here in Michigan
nearly spit out our coffee this
morning when they read Gover-
nor Romney's op-ed in the Detroit
News," Brewer said.
During the call, former Demo-
cratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm
said she felt Romney's claims
were hypocritical and inconsis-
tent with opinions he had previ-
ouslyexpressed.
"(Romney) turned his back on
Michigan," Granholm said. "He
stabbed us in theback in our dark-
est hour."
Granholm, who- now hosts
the news show "The War Room"
on the cable channel Current,
said she thought the recession
would worsen if Romney's plan
was implemented, adding that
Obama's policies have helped
improve industry in the state.
In another op-ed Romney pub-
lished in The New York Times
in 2008 - titled "Let Detroit Go
Bankrupt" - Romney detailed a
plan for the failing auto industry.
In the piece, he called condemned
any plan that would use govern-
ment loans to bail out auto com-
panies.
In yesterday's piece, Romney
wrote that Obama's assistance in
Detroit was ultimately detrimen-
tal.
"The president tells us that
without his intervention things in
Detroit would be worse," Romney

wrote. "I believe that without his
intervention things there would
be better."
He wrote that Obama's plan
exploited taxpayers through pro-
viding the bailout, adding that
working through the bankruptcy
would have been more effective.
"Managed bankruptcy may
sound like a death knell," Romney
wrote. "But in fact, it is a way for a
troubled company to restructure
itself rapidly, entering and leav-
ing the courtroom sometimes in
weeks or months instead of years,
and then returning to profitable
operation."
Rep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.)
said on the call that Romney's
plan would have been harmful to
the auto industry.
"(Romney was) running away
from the reality facing the auto
industry," Levin said.
In the call, Rep. John Dingell
(D-Mich.) lauded Obama's han-
dling of the auto industry failure
during his term.
Dingell said 200,000 new jobs
were created and 150,000 are set
to be available over the next four
years, adding that the auto indus-
try had its strongest year since
1994 in 2011.
"The president refused to turn
his back on Michigan," Dingell
said.
According to Dingell, Rom-
ney's article was simply a stra-
tegic. move for Michigan's
upcoming primary election on
Feb. 28.
"Mr. Romney changes his
position as often as he changes
his underwear," he said.
In a poll conducted on Monday

and released by the polling group
Rasmussen, Romney trailed
Republican candidate and for-
mer Pennsylvania Sen. Rick San-
torum by three points. Santorum
led in the poll with 35 percent,
while Romney received 32 per-
cent of the vote. Other contend-
ers were well behind Santorum
and Romney, with Rep. Ron Paul
earning 13 percent and former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich
garnering 11 percent of the vote.
Romney, who has long been
considered the front-runner for
the Republican nomination, con-
siders himself a Detroit native
and has ties to Michigan's auto
industry. His father, George
Romney, served as chairman and
president of American Motors
Corporation and was also the
governor of Michigan from 1963
to 1969.
. Dingell said Romney is
attempting to take credit for the
achievements of the auto indus-
try legislation, as well as for the
economic turnaround.
"(Romney) wants to rush on
and claim success and claim par-
ticipation in that success," Ding-
ell said. "But his position earlier
was significantly different."
Levin said Romney's failure to
stand by earlier claims casts his
legitimacy as a presidential can-
didate into doubt.
"We want candidates to tell
the truth," Levin said. "We need
to know what they stand for."
Romney and the other Repub-
lican candidates will be travel-
ing the state in the coming week
in preparation for the Michigan
primary on Feb. 28.



ASSEMBLY

apply for funding through
the Student Organization Fund-
ing Commission - a section of
CSG's executive branch. Repre-
sentatives at last night's meeting
expressed concerned with the
lack of legislative oversight on
student organization funding.
* Speaker of the Assembly Matt
Eral said changes to the process
in which student organizations
apply for money could impact the
convenience and effectiveness of
funding student groups - a core
responsibility for CSG.
"One of the biggest things, if
not the thing (the University's
Board of Regents), want to see
from (CSG) is a funding report,"
Eral said. "That's one (of CSG's)
principal function."
Another proposed resolutions
expressed support for a bill in the
Michigan House of Representa-
tives bill that could potentially
enforce de facto medical amnesty
throughout the state.
The resolution was expedited
and passed unanimously last
night so CSG representatives
could discuss it at the at the Stu-
dent Association of Michigan
conference - a gathering for the
state's student leaders - being
. held this weekend.
CSG is currently attempting
to implement a medical amnesty
program at the University and
passed a resolution on Jan. 24
in support of this motion.
LSA junior Sebastian Swae-
Shampine, assistant executive
director of the University's chap-
ter of Students for Sensible Drug
Policy, spoke at the meeting on
behalf of the resolution.
"Medical Amnesty is just a
social imperative," Swae-Shamp-
ine said. "Presently we have stu-
dents that are hesitating and we
have lives that are being unrea-
sonably lost because people are
afraid of any kind of legal reper-
cussions."

Swae-Shampine added it
was important that the medi-
cal amnesty proposal isn't inter-
preted as an excuse for students
to 'recklessly endanger their lives.
"I'm not condoning that sort
of consumption or especially that
sort of over-consumption by any
stretch of the imagination," he
said.
Another proposed resolution
endorsed the removal of a spou-
sal work-study requirement for
childcare subsidies. Members of
the Graduate Employees Organi-
zation have been meeting month-
ly with University administrators
to resolve the issue.
As it stands now, the spouse
of parent seeking childcare must
be working, enrolled as at least
a half-time student or a combi-
nation of the two for at least 20
hours a week to be eligible for the
childcare subsidy.
Rackham representative Pat-
rick O'Mahen, the resolution's
author and a former Michi-
gan Daily columnist, said this
requirement is not always fea-
sible for student-parents, adding
he hopes the resolution will "put
public pressure on the admin-
istration to do the right thing in
this case."
The CSG proposal also calls
for the University to apply it's
decision to all students, not just
members of GEO. Furthermore,
it would pledge $30,000 of CSG's
own funds to the adopted plan.
O'Mahen described the proposed
financing as "a grant with some
strings attached."
CSG also prepared for
next month's student goven-
rment elections. The Assembly
approved a recommendation for
the elections director and passed
a resolution forming the Election
Code Select Committee, which
will look at potential reforms to
CSG's election code.
At the meeting, seven repre-
sentatives were formally recalled,
bringing the total number of rep-
resentatives down to3 members
and the number for quorum to18.

Hunwick learned from early-season ejection

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
In late October, the Michigan
hockey team embarked on its first
road trip of the year, traveling
up to Marquette - a town that is
basically the Great White North
- to take on Northern Michigan.
It was the first CCHA test for the
fifth-ranked Wolverines.
In the series opener, fifth-year
senior goaltender Shawn Hun-
wick was posting a shutout, mak-
ing 17 saves through a period and
a half.
But then a Wildcat forward
ran into Hunwick after a shot -
Hunwick responded by sending
him to the ice with a mean right
hook. He was ejected from the
game, forcing untested sopho-
more Adam Janecyk into the
game. Michigan lost 5-3, then
fell in a shootout the next night.
Michigan took one out of six
points in its first CCHA series of
the year - and Hunwick was a
big reason for that unsuccessful
first weekend.
On a team with eight fresh-
men, it's hard to imagine that the
24-year-old Hunwick would be
the poster child for improvement
in the maturity department. But

Aw,-

f

times, including a scary moment
when he was blindsided and
needed a couple minutes to right
himself. He stuck to his post.
"Before that Northern game, I
didn't think something like that
was going to happen," Hunwick
said. "But after you have that
experience in the back of your
head, you know that you aren't
going to get to that point again."
Hunwick has been Michigan's
best player this year, earning a
spot among the handful of Hobey
Baker contenders. When he's
on - and he has been for about
the last two months - Michigan
is one of the best teams in the
country. Hunwick keeping his
cool and focusing on goaltending *
instead of boxing is a major rea-
son the Wolverines are within
striking distance of first place in
the CCHA.
"I think he's definitelybeen the
difference in a handful of games
this year," Berenson said. "He
was the reason we won the game
on Saturday (against Michigan
State). He's having a great year."
When the Wildcats visit Ann
Arbor this weekend, they will
find a different, wiser Hunwick
in net --and they only have them-
selves to blame.

Fifth-year senior goaltender Shawn Hunwick was ejected from a game in Marquette in October for his part in a goal-mouth skirmish with a Wildcat forward.

with the regular season wind-
ing down, it's become clear how
much Hunwick has changed
since the tussle in the Berry Cen-
ter.
"I think he's figured it out,"
said Michigan coach Red Beren-
son. "It's part of the game. We
need to protect him, but in the
same token, he's got to under-
react. It's not his battle. His battle

is to stop the puck.
"With any goalie, if they get
distracted, they aren't the same."
The Wolverines have com-
pleted their most physical three-
series stretch of the season,
playing on the road against Notre
Dame and Michigan State, and
taking on Miami (Ohio) at home.
In each of those series, but espe-
cially against the Fighting Irish

and RedHawks, Hunwick was
knocked down, beaten up and
battered.
In South Bend, there was a
scrum near the net after almost
every save. Freshman forward
Alex Guptill said Notre Dame
played dirty to try to incite Hun-
wick to repeat his knock-out per-
formance. But Hunwick stayed
out of the fray, letting the other

Wolverines around him deal with
the extracurricular activities.
"I feel like, in that Notre Dame
series, ifI didn't already have that
Northern Michigan experience,
I would have acted differently,"
Hunwick said.
When the RedHawks visited
Yost two weeks later, they seemed
to have a similar plan. Hunwick
was knocked to the ice several

Between Nike, Adidas, Wil-

allowed to choose the.type of ball
they want going through their
nets from a bevy of options. Until
postseason play, when the Wil-
son Solution is used, each school
gets to choose the ball it uses for
home games. The preference of
Michigan coach John Beilein
dates back 20-plus years.
"I just have a long association
with The Rock," he said. "I used
it way back to LeMoyne and also
at the Division-I level. I've used
The Rock, I think, all the time.
They have a good product."
Though many teams choose to
stick with their school's sponsor
for their choice of ball, Michigan
passed over Adidas in favor of
The Rock - a brand from Ana-
conda Sports.
"It feels very much like the
Wilson, which we use in the
NCAA Tournament," Beilein
said. "That's why I like it."
Beilein also uses the ball for
other reasons - to support his
moonlighting job asa salesman.
"I have a great association
with them," he said. "And I also .
have my own ball that I sell

Wisconsin is the only school in

"I think it's fun a lot of times
going into a new stadium and
playing with a different ball,"
said senior guard Stu Douglass.
"I don't know if 're-focus' is the
right word, but you want to shoot
well, and it's a big part of getting
big road wins."
Each ball has its own idiosyn-
crasies that can affect a player's
comfort level.
Though each brand has eight
panels to the ball, there are cer-
tain discrepancies: the depth of
the seams, the toughness of the
leather and the stickiness of the
ball.
"The Adidas ball is different
from the Nike balls," Douglass
said. "And we play with The

the things get a little monoto-

- haven't been kind to the Wol-

which has gone 5-7 away from

But if Michigan fans are wor-

A couple of weeks ago, the Michi-
gan hockeyteam whipped out a tro-
phy with a hockey helmet mounted
on a slab of wood and played a
three-on-three intrasquad match
for it. The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team had simpler plans for
its bye week.
"Just working on our plays and
defense - normal stuff," said junior
guard Nya Jordan.
. After the Wolverines upset then-
No. 13 Nebraska last Thursday, the
team didn't skip abeat going back to
its normal routine.
"We took Friday off," said Michi-
gan coach Kevin Borseth. "Satur-
day morning, we practiced, went
through a couple things to stay
fresh, took Sunday off, and we came
back Monday and (started) all over
again."
Michigan doesn't have much
time to relax, as the final push for
the postseason has begun. The Wol-
verines have fpur games left and
will continue their run to March on
Thursday against Iowa.
And they aren't wasting any of
their free time. Senior guard Car-
men Reynolds emphasized that
though the team has more time to
practice, its routine is the same. She
said the team focused on strength
training and taking advantage of
the extra rest this week.
With the extra time, Michigan
has been able to take a deeper look
into its game against the Hawkeyes
and take a detailed approach to the
gameplan.
"(Practice is) really focused,"

Reynolds said. "Each practice, we
focus on defense and offense. You
can break everything down and
spend more time on it, which really
helps."
Added fellow senior guard
Courtney Boylan: "A lot of the stuff
that we do in practice is oriented to
who we're playing. (It's) important
to look at, having a week to prepare
for a team. Maybe you could lose
sight of what you're doing, but for
us, I think it will be good overall."
So far, the Wolverines have kept
their eyes on making sure they earn
an NCAA Tournament bid. The
season has been a tough test for
Michigan, but the team has weath-
ered the schedule well, sitting at 7-5
in conference play and 18-7 overall.
The Wolverines have taken down
two ranked teams, Ohio State and
Nebraska, and they won 12 of their
first 14 games - a program-best.
But those games are behind
them, and right now, Michigan is
just looking to its next opponent.
The Wolverines are not looking at
Sunday's game in Bloomington, and
they haven't even thought aboutthe
Big ''en or NCAA tournaments -
this short-term focus is something
Borseth has been stressing all sea-
son.
"The job isn't over until the
paperwork's done, it's one of those
things," Borsethsaid. "We're at that
stage right now. We're just plugging
away one day, one game at a time,
trying to make sure we get what's
taken care of out of the way first."
And regardless of how much rest 0
they've gotten, Reynolds under-
stands that it's what happens on
Thursday that matters the most.

DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY
EXCEPTIONAL?
The Statement is calling for
nominations for its annual Students
of the Year issue.
Please send a brief paragraph stating
why a student deserves to be chosen
to thestatement@umich.edu.
Students must be currently enrolled
at the University of Michigan.
Multiple nominations are permitted.

Letter from the editor
by Kaitlin Williams
Iwould like to thank Magazine Editors Jennifer Xu and Dylan Cinti for giving me the
reigns to select the student work featured in this year's Literary Issue. After advertis-
ing for submissions in The Michigan Daily, posting fliers and spamming e-mail lists, I
received dozens of submissions from talented University students showcasing their works.
I took the names off each submission before printing it out because several submissions
were from past and present classmates and I wanted to ensure impartiality during the
judging process. I'm proud of my peers when I say that deciding on the work displayed in
the following pages wasn't easy.
As a writer, I know what it's like to tap your soul into a keyboard. As a human being, I
know what it's like to be rejected. Several times during this process I've thought to myself,
"What gives me the right to put these poems and short stories into yes, no and maybe piles?"
The truth is what has made being involved with The Statement such an enriching experience
for me. This is a student-run publication. I'm a student and a writer. I haven't been published.
I received a brief moment of vindication when I won a Hopwood Award from the University
for a short story I wrote last year. I'm not a member of the Hopwood selection committee, a
professor or an admissions officer. I chose the following poems and short stories with care,
knowing this could be the only time I will be on this end of the selection process. My sub-
missions were rejected for the Literary Issue published last year. I'll be rejected from many
publications over my lifetime. I want to shine a spotlight
on the work here as a small triumph for its authors and
for myself. This may only be a small sampling of the
talent the University has to offer, but I think all of the
work here displays something every person can relate to.
Whether you write for a living, for fun, for.catharsis or
for your sanity, I hope you read yourself into the stories
and poems here.

Fuck Me Heels
a method of strapping crocodile over
smooth enameled skin, freshly waxed
and tan, laundered fresh, slide the foot
slowly at first, tentatively point the big toe
wrapped in Lady Luck red and slide
slide across the sueded bottom
with velvet of foot whose bottom
is flushed pink, embarrassed,
red-lipstick whispers of
never-been-touched virgin skin
let the heel fall, not pop, into strappy back
crisscross cage inside unforgiving black
pinch the thin, quiet strap through the mouth
of the silver clasp, slide up inside the sheath
and violate the thinness with metallic stab
squeeze the buckle closed and release
the pressure from your fingertips
that singe like cigarettes
and flex like a full-bodied moan.

Anytime
by Alexander Kang
let go of the ball and the world came up
She told me something important but I forgot about it
So I asked her,
"Jenny, what was your name again?"
A scientist thought of an elevator
and wrote about gravity
A painter thought about autumn
and painted a portrait of himself
A poet thought about pain
and wrote about her
Do you know what appears
if you stare at a pencil for a long time?
A pencil
What's fair, you ask?
A fish cannot breathe at land
A human cannot breathe underwater
Isn't that fair?
Or is it a balance?

Poems by Logan Corey

"They bleed for each other," Mr. Shifterton said in that all-knowing, dra-
matic tongue that only writers and philosophers talk like. "Silly, silly kids."
Mrs. Carrysherself licked her sticky lipsticked mouth and nodded along,
vodka-glazed eyes batting heavy lids, thick with black and blue dust caked
on like sympathy on church Sunday. Clammer-lashed in the kitchen, a'
waiter tripped dishes slipped lids lifted women sifted in purses for dis-
tractions men glared at watches and re-tracked conversation tactic com-
petition lacking spark. No sir, sorry sir, voices blurred and jewel-adorned'
necks and shoulders shifted. Upon noticing a rip in her stockings, Mrs.
Carrysherself exited the party hastily. Mr. Shifterton took his wife's silky
palm, nails scratching off beauty and the two followed, sniffing in pungent
odors of bottled flowers and exhaled wine and Lysol.

I put a lemon candy in my mouth
and it tastes like lemon
Though the Sun
still rises in the morning
and sets at night,
I became this
and you became that,
and now that I'm this
and you are that,
for you, I want to sleep the night
So I turned on the switch
and created light
Pressed the button
and produced a film
Drew lines on a paper
and wrote a poem
Turned a knob
and changed the weather
Killed myself at twenty
and died at twenty five
From what I heard,
time cannot be reversed,
but if today were to be yesterday,
I would make the same mistakes twice

- A
It's morning. You shuffle out of bed, moaning. All you want to do is
sleep, but no such luck. With a dull thud, your feet hit the ground and
you shamble over towards the stairs. As you walk, mottled flecks of
your flesh peel off, leaving pieces of yourself behind you.
Gripping the railing, you cautiously maneuver the stairs. It's harder
to do now that rigor mortis has set in, but you slowly make your way down.
A smear of blood slicks the hand railing, trailing from your arm. On a fresh
corpse like you, cuts just sort of slowly ooze blood, without a heartbeat to
really pump it out anymore.
When you arrive at the landing, you trip a little on the stair and
step down way too hard. You wince as you hear the now-familiar sound of
a toe crunching. Sighing, you bend down and grab the injured digit. With a
wrenching motion and a sharp crack, the toe is gone. You can't go walking
around with a broken toe, the bone jagged and catching on things as you
step. In terms of hygiene, you could really use a shower. The smell of your
three-day old corpse is getting quite rank.
You attempt to right yourself, but realize that you can't. When you
bent over you stretched your vertebrae too far without realizing it, and now
your back refuses to cooperate. You try to go towards the kitchen, hunched
over, but you keep bashing into the chairs of the dining room. With an
exasperated groan, you take a few steps backward and try to swing your
torso side to side. Unfortunately, instead of loosening your back like you
had hoped, you twist and end up with your torso no longer being aligned
with your legs. Now that you are bending over to the left instead of above
your feet, you will have to walk sideways. You bash your head into several
chairs and even the dining table but, to your frustration, not hard enough to
put you out of your misery. Damn rigor mortis.
Finally in the kitchen, you shuffle sideways over to the counter.
Placing both of your hands on the countertop, you proceed to push yourself
up as hard as you can. With a pop you are suddenly standing upright, but,
your body is still twisted to the left. You grab the counter again then shove
and spin your torso to the right. It works, and you're standing upright and
even facing forward. You're feeling pretty clever for having figured that
mess of anatomy out, until you notice that you seem a little taller. You look
down and realize that your vertebrae came out of your legs a little and now
small portion of bone is visible between your body and your pelvis. Some-
times, being a zombie makes you want to crawl into your bed like it was a
coffin and never, ever leave.
Too late for that now, you suppose, but there's always hope. You
yawn out of habit, but your useless lungs rebuff the sweet air that used
to be so vital. At least, you assume it tastes sweet, nothing really has any

flavor to you anymore. Besides, with a corpse ruminating in the house for
a few days and none of the doors or windows open, the air is probably as
foul smelling as you are. One more benefit to the rotting of your olfactory
organs, right?
Your jaw won't close, but you've had all you can take without your
morning coffee. You start a fresh brew with your mouth lamely flapping
open. You open the cupboards, but realize you haven't taken the time to
clean the dishes in a while. In fact, it's been a long time since you did any
housework at all, or anything else productive for that matter. It's hard to
be bothered to care about that sort of thing when you're an undead corpse
walking around trying not to fall apart.
You grab one of the used cups from the sink, fairly confident that
any germs from a dirty dish can't give you anything worse than what you've
already got. You're careful not to smear any of the blood from your hands
onto the cup, and move over to the coffee machine to pour. A pleasant curl
of steam rises from the cup as you hold it between your fingers. You raise
it to your mouth to take a drink, but it all pools in your lower jaw and over-
flows onto your shirt. You forgot to unpop your jaw. Not that it matters,
really. You wouldn't have been able to taste it anyways and it would have
just pooled in your stomach and sloshed around. However, you feel it's
good to maintain your routine. You try and appear to still be your normal,
cheerful self so as to prevent concerned neighbors, doctors, scientists, or
would-be zombie hunters from realizing what's going on. Also, finding out
that you've become an undead shell of a person, a necromantic ghoul that
plagues the living with death and terror, was a bit of a shock so you're going
through some serious denial.
You debate eating the food in the pantry, but decide against it. It
wouldn't help your self-esteem at all to become one of those fatso zombies,
and your body is already working against you with the gases inside your
stomach making it swell up like a balloon. You can feel the hunger growing,
gnawing away at the inside of your stomach. In an odd way you kind of like
making it wait. You're so numb to everything else that you relish any sensa-
tion, even if it is painful.
You manage to get through the dining room without further inci-
dent and sit down in the living room chair, wondering what to do with your-
self. To be honest, you don't feel like doing much of anything. You don't
particularly want to go outside, and it wouldn't be advisable even if you
did. Nothing seems to have much meaning anymore, nothing has any point.
You're already dead, so why bother doing anything? You look around the
room, with the sunlight casting a grey light on everything through the win-,
dow shades.

You seem to excel at brooding, but even then you only seem to
be able to dwell on the negatives. Mistakes you made, things you should
have done better or differently, unhappy memories surge forward to swal-
low your mind. The problem with being a zombie isn't the boredom, it's the
Goddamn melancholy. You've got to do something to shake this apathy.
You've considered going and seeing a doctor, but can't see that
it would do you any good. Penicillindoesn't do much for undeath, and
they'd want to keep you for experimentation and close study. Who are
you kidding, they'd just do what they always do: throw more pills at you,
then throw you out the door. You consider hanging out with some of your
friends, but don't want to risk a broken neck. Besides, they're never any real
help anyways. One of the rules of the undead is that they don't talk about
being dead. That way they can pretend everything's normal and never have
to have any uncomfortable conversations about rotting skin, the hunger, or,
worse yet, feelings.
Thinking about the'hunger seems to summon it up, and it rampag-
es angrily in your stomach. You get up and go to the fridge in the kitchen.
Sitting on a plate next to a carton of spoiled milk and a container of rotten
eggs is a head. You managed to find the energy to go out of the house last
night long enough to do some hunting. Poor guy never saw it coming. Just
because you're a zombie doesn't mean you've forgotten your table man-
ners, so you go and grab some utensils from a drawer. With a knife, you
carefully carve off the scalp and lay it aside. You never did like eating the
crust. Then you lay a napkin down upon your lap and dig in. This is how you
keep going, by feeding off of other people. It makes you feel like a parasite,
but you don't have any other choice. Besides, it's always nice to dive into
someone's head for a little while to escape the problems in your own.
After your meal, you figure you don't have anything better to do, so
you wander over to the computer. Your hands streak blood on the keyboard
and mouse, but it doesn't bother you. You watch videos and laugh when
you know you're supposed to, you scroll through Facebook and perform the
perfunctory "likes" and make the expected comments. None of it matters,
but at least you can afford to be brain-dead for a while.
A while turns out to be longer than you thought it would, and when
you pull yourself out of your digital tomb, the room is dark. You shamble
through the living room and back up the stairs. The climb is not easy, but
you manage to keep all the toes you have left.
You climb into bed and pull the covers over yourself, not that you
can even feel cold. There's little that's colder than death.
Maybe zombies can't sleep, but sometimes you sure wish that you
could cry.
