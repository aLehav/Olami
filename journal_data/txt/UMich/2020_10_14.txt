Landlords in Ann Arbor are 

pushing ahead with fall leasing 
for the 2021-2022 school year, 
despite the ongoing COVID-
19 pandemic, while students 
question if they should sign 

leases as early as they have in 
prior years.

The fall leasing period many 

Ann Arbor landlords observe — 
in which tenants whose leases 
start shortly before the academic 
year begins are asked to decide 
whether to renew less than three 
months into their lease — has 

pushed students to make quick 
decisions about their off-campus 
living 
situations 
for 
years. 

Under the circumstances of the 
pandemic, however, long-term 
planning and dealing with these 
early deadlines have become a 
bigger challenge for students.

This is the case for LSA 

sophomore Mia Waelchli, who 
in late August moved into an 
apartment unit managed by 
Varsity Management, a company 
that manages more than two 
dozen off-campus properties 
in Ann Arbor. A little more 

Sandra Steingraber, an alum of 

the University of Michigan and 
former opinion writer for The 
Michigan Daily, said she doesn’t 
remember the University’s first 
arrest following the deputization 
of 
campus 
police 
officers. 

Steingraber, who was a Rackham 
student at the time and now 

teaches environmental studies at 
Ithaca College, was unconscious. 
She was carried away on a 
stretcher by the Ann Arbor Fire 
Department after being thrown 
to the ground by an Ann Arbor 
police officer on Oct. 6, 1988.

“I have a really strong memory 

of the back of my head hitting the 
pavement because it just sounded 
like a metal bat hitting a ball,” 
Steingraber said. 

When Leo Heatley, director of 

the University’s Department of 
Public Safety, draped his coat over 
Steingraber, Cale Southworth, 
then a colleague of Steingraber’s 
at The Daily, demanded Heatley 
get off her. Heatley then threw 
Southworth to the ground. After 
Southworth tried to run away, 
DPS Assistant Director Robert 
Pifer arrested him. Heatley and 
Pifer were the first two public 
safety officers deputized at the 
University. 

Prior to former University 

President 
James 
Duderstadt’s 

inauguration, 
dozens 
of 

protesters 
demonstrated 
on 

North University Ave. Students 
criticized what they called a 
clandestine process to install 
Duderstadt as president, alleging 
violations of the Open Meetings 
Act, 
which 
requires 
local 

governing 
bodies 
to 
conduct 

their business transparently. The 
students also took issue with 

Duderstadt’s 
ties 
to 
military 

research. 

Steingraber attempted to enter 

Hill 
Auditorium 
with 
Rollie 

Hudson, an opinion writer at 
The Daily, to cover the ceremony. 
Steingraber said when Hudson 
reached 
into 
his 
pocket 
to 

display his press pass to the law 
enforcement officers blocking the 
entrance, police tackled him to 
the ground.

“He started bleeding and they 

were grinding his head to the 
pavement, and it became suddenly 
very 
dreamlike,” 
Steingraber 

said. “It was as if no sound was 
coming out of my mouth.”

She and other students followed 

Hudson as police allegedly tossed 
him in the unmarked car. 

“He started to smear his blood 

on the inside of the windows to 
show us that he was bleeding,” 
Steingraber said.

ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The 
Washtenaw 
County 

Health Department alerted the 
public Monday afternoon to a 
possibility of exposure at two Ann 
Arbor restaurants, Brown Jug on 
S. University Ave. and Chapala 
Mexican Restaurant on N. Main 
St. Anyone who was at Brown Jug 
from Oct. 1-3 and Oct. 6 and Chapala 
on Oct. 1 should quarantine and 
monitor for symptoms.

Currently, 13 cases are linked to 

the two restaurants, not including 
six positive cases at popular 
student bar and restaurant Brown 
Jug dating back to August. 

Jimena Loveluck, health officer 

for Washtenaw County, noted 
that contact tracing is difficult 
with cases coming from public 
interactions in a restaurant setting. 

“In most situations, we can 

contact individuals exposed to 
COVID-19 directly,” Loveluck said. 
“Unfortunately, with the number 
of positive cases that report visiting 

each of these establishments at 
crowded times, there is a possibility 
of widespread, public exposure.”

After the first cases were linked 

to the Brown Jug, the restaurant 
closed from Aug. 30 to Sept. 
8. Owner Perry Porikos, who 
also owns the Blue Leprechaun 
and Study Hall Lounge in Ann 
Arbor, told all employees who 
tested 
positive 
to 
quarantine 

in 
accordance 
with 
health 

department protocol.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Porikos said he 
implemented several new safety 
protocols, 
including 
having 

employees come in through the 
same entrance, increasing the 
frequency of testing and installing 
plexiglass 
barriers 
between 

booths. However, one concern 
has been the number of patrons 
waiting in line outside the bar, and 
the difficulty of making sure they 
are social distancing and wearing 
masks.

This year’s Latinx Heritage 

Month emphasized unity and 
diversity 
within 
the 
Latinx 

community 
through 
music, 

which was celebrated virtually 
at the University from mid-
September until Tuesday. 

Javier 
Solorzano 
Parada, 

program 
manager 
of 
Multi-

Ethnic Student Affairs, was one 
of the heads of Latinx Heritage 
Month. Solorzano said the ability 
to invite multiple speakers from 
outside of Michigan to the remote 
event made LHM particularly 
engaging.

“It 
was 
powerful 
hearing 

people say ‘hello’ from a different 
state, something that we weren’t 
able to see during programming 
before,” Solorzano said. “I’ve 
seen momentum and engagement 
continue throughout the whole 
month because we were able 
to have different speakers at 
different points in the month, 
whereas in other years, we 
focused on our large events, the 
opening and closing ceremonies.” 

Solorzano said events that 

took place highlighted a range 
of topics, including imposter 
syndrome, generational trauma, 
anti-Blackness and more. Faculty, 
staff and students participated in 
planning LHM.

Public Policy graduate student 

Baltazar Hernández, member 
of the programming committee, 
said 
the 
committee 
focused 

including diverse voices within 

the Latinx community. 

“One challenge was figuring 

out 
what 
Latinx 
Heritage 

Month looks like in a virtual 
environment 
and 
we 
were 

grappling with how to celebrate 
the diverse cultures within the 
Latinx umbrella so we wanted 
to incorporate as many different 
voices as we could,” Hernández 
said. 

The Afro Latinx community 

was highlighted during this 
year’s LHM through the logo 
and music. Sizzle Fantastic, a 
DJ and curator of Cumbiatón, 
a nationwide party that pays 
homage to the Afro Latinx 
culture, played at the opening 
ceremony.

“We 
really 
wanted 
to 

emphasize Afro Latinx identity 
and specifically through music,” 
Hernández said. “We’re trying to 
build a mosaic of different stories 
that these instruments (in the 
logo) tell and how diverse our 
narratives are as people from a 
larger region.”

Business junior Alex Jimenez 

was on the marketing committee 
for LHM and strategized the 
promotion of events. 

“We’ve had to be very flexible 

and 
instead 
of 
promoting 

different groups’ events before 
the programming for LHM even 
starts, we promote as much as 
we can during LHM for the days 
preceding each event,” Jimenez 
said. 

LSA junior Ximena Mancilla, 

who was the undergraduate 
coordinator 
for 
LHM, 
said 

cybersecurity issues prompted 

the LHM team to utilize the 
webinar feature on Zoom rather 
than 
the 
traditional 
format 

where participants can see each 
other. 

One in-person aspect of the 

programming 
was 
the 
safe 

distribution of “movie bags” 
to students on campus for the 
virtual Netflix parties put on 
every Saturday during LHM. 
Mancilla said the committee 
gave students popcorn, candy 
and jarritos, a popular fruit-
flavored soda, for people to 
snack on during watch parties of 
movies like Spiderman: Into the 
Spider-verse and the TV show 
Gente-fied. 

“Celebrating our culture does 

not stop after this month, we still 
have so much more to do and 
every day we should be proud of 
who we are because we deserve 
to be here at the University of 
Michigan no matter what anyone 
says,” Mancilla said. “I want 
everyone to keep being proud 
of where they come from: their 
family, roots and traditions.”

Events like LHM are especially 

important 
at 
predominantly 

white institutions because they 
can shed light on the difficulties 
of being a person of color in these 
spaces, according to Jimenez, 
who also noted the exclusion of 
opinions of people of color in the 
implementation of the Michigan 
Ambassadors program. 

Jimenez said voting in the 

upcoming presidential election 
can amplify Latinx voices.

“Latinx voter turnout could 

determine 
this 
election 
and 

I really hope things turn out 
for the best,” Jimenez said. 
“There have been a few speakers 
who have talked about the 
importance of voter turnout. 
Even at our opening ceremony, 
we had a Kahoot where one of 
the questions asked how many 
Latinx people would be eligible 
to vote this year … I think it’s just 
small stuff like that that puts it 
into peoples’ heads.” 

Solorzano said he hopes LHM 

will continue to be a way to learn 
about other peoples’ experiences 
and to share the Latinx identity 
with the campus community. 

“We are all navigating through 

very difficult times and with this 
pandemic, we are all viewing 
things through very different 
lenses,” Solorzano said. “For me 
it’s so great to hear committee 
members 
and 
community 

members excited about events 
happening on campus … that 
excitement and that celebration 
is something that I think creates 
many 
strong 
memories 
for 

students who are joining us, 
especially first-year students.”

Mancilla highlighted the need 

to focus on embracing the Latinx 
identity. 

“We belong here and have 

worked so hard to be here,” 
Mancilla said. “We continue to 
fight for this equality, but also we 
don’t want to sweat it too much 
because we know our worth 
and don’t want our parents’ and 
families’ sacrifice to go in vain.”

The Holly and John Madigan Newsroom in 2018. Holly Madigan passed away September 20.

Holly Madigan, for whom 

The 
Michigan 
Daily’s 

newsroom 
is 
named 
along 

with her husband John, passed 
away on Sept. 20. We want to 
send our sympathies to John 
Madigan, as the gifts Holly and 
John gave the newsroom have 
created so many opportunities 
for our staff.

John and Holly Madigan 

have 
been 
tremendous 

supporters 
of 
The 
Daily, 

donating funds to renovate our 
newsroom and create a need-
based scholarship in 2015. The 
Madigans also gifted The Daily 
$300,000 in 2019 to sustain 
professional 
development 

and help us work toward 
financial stability. Holly and 
John named the fund after 
Michigan 
Daily 
alum 
Ann 

Marie Lipinski, former editor 
of The Chicago Tribune. 

The 
Madigans’ 
generous 

gifts allowed The Daily to 
bring in veteran journalists 
for short-term fellowships in 

2019, and to finance student 
research this past summer into 
making The Daily’s revenue 
and 
content 
model 
more 

sustainable.

Holly and John’s names and 

photos, along with the phrase 
“May all who enter value the 
importance 
of 
journalism, 

media and business,” sit atop a 
central wall in our newsroom. 
Our staff misses everything 
about our newsroom right now, 
and our newsroom misses us, 
too. We’re looking forward to 
the day freshmen can book it 

to the newsroom after class 
to share their story with an 
intimidating editor and when 
the whole newsroom works 
together during the frenzied 
energy of an election night. For 
now, our newsroom is symbolic 
and spreads between all our 
computer 
screens. 
Despite 

our current lack of physical 
newsroom, Holly and John’s 
great contributions support us 
as we work on our journalism.

in Chief of The Michigan Daily

“Legally, 
I 
cannot 
really 

enforce 
that,” 
Porikos 
said. 

“Legally the only thing I can do 
is (say) ‘Listen, if you don’t listen 
to me, nobody comes in ... Last 
week and the weekend before 
I came to the point where I tell 
my managers — because I have 

more than one place — ‘Hey, if 
they don’t listen, we’re going to 
be here for the long run, just lock 
it up.’ Instead of 2 o’clock we’ll 
close like 12:15 to 12:20. So by 
doing that hopefully, we’ll get to 
the point where they’ll comply a 
little bit more.”

Porikos said it is difficult to 

determine where the cases came 
from or where the virus may have 
spread within his restaurant, 

particularly due to the number of 
students moving from bar to bar 
around town. 

“Especially 
on 
South 
U, 

there’s no way that I’m going to 
go to Rick’s and stay there for 
hours and not go to another bar,” 
Porikos said. “There’s no way I’m 
going to go to Blue Leprechaun 
and not going to go to Brown 
Jug. There are students walking 
around. It would be sad for me 

to say, ‘This is the place.’ I don’t 
blame the victim, but it seems 
to me that I’m doing pretty good 
with one third of the capacity, my 
employees are happy, I believe 
customers are happy, that’s why 
they keep coming. So I really 
cannot tell you.”

Steingraber said she was jarred 

by how the police treated her 
colleague Hudson, a Black man.

“We 
were 
just 
reporters 

who were going inside to cover 
something that we had every right 
to go into, and it wasn’t me who 
was grabbed and smashed into the 
ground,” Steingraber said. “It was 
the Black man standing next to 
me.”

Steingraber 
remembers 

standing in front of the car as 
other students surrounded it, 
but from that point, she said her 
memory fades. Laura Shue, who 
was an LSA junior, told The Daily 
at the time the AAPD officer threw 
Steingraber on the ground “with a 
vengeance” for blocking the car. 

“There was no need to use that 

much force,” Shue said. “I’d never 
seen anything like it. They don’t 
need guns if they’re that brutal.”

Hudson did not respond to 

request for comment prior to 
publication.

In the aftermath of the incident, 

University 
student 
activists 

mobilized against the Duderstadt 
administration as it increased the 
presence of law enforcement on 
campus, first instituted as part of 
a policy that students said limited 
protests 
against 
controversial 

guest speakers. 

After 
police 
officers 
killed 

George Floyd — and ensuing 
protests 
have 
heightened 

awareness and scrutiny of police 
misconduct — members of the 
Graduate Employees’ Organization 
went on strike and included 
demands to divert funding from 
policing in their platform.

A review of the controversial 

history of law enforcement on 
campus shows this is not the first 
time student activists have gone 
toe to toe with the University’s 
administration 
over 
policing. 

Students are now bringing forward 
similar 
anti-policing 
measures 

more than 30 years after the 
University deputized officers. 

“It’s considered normal now for 

there to be basically a police force 
on campus,” Steingraber said. “It 
didn’t used to be that way.”

Creating the police force 
In 1986, public safety officers 

carried flashlights, clipboards and 
radios, patrolling campus in shifts 
as small as three for a University 
with more than 30,000 students. 
Their only power was to make 
a “citizen’s arrest” if they saw 
someone committing a felony. In 
dangerous situations, the officers 
were to call the Ann Arbor Police 
Department. Public Safety Officer 
Vickie Juopperi told The Daily in 
August 1986 that people would 
generally 
comply 
more 
with 

deputized public safety officers 
who had the power to make real 
arrests.

“I think that if they knew we 

have authority, that would tend to 
put a lid on things easier,” Juopperi 
said. 

Jack 
Weidenbach, 
former 

University director of business 

operations whose office oversaw 
campus 
security, 
opposed 

deputization in 1986, as did Regent 
Deane Baker, a Republican who 
was first elected to the body in 
1972 and served for 24 years.

“I don’t think the University 

should be in the business of 
operating a police force,” Baker 
said in an article published in The 
Daily in 1986.

During this period, University 

administrators 
became 

increasingly agitated by student 
activists interrupting appearances 
from high-profile speakers such 
as Vice President George H.W. 
Bush, United Nations Ambassador 
Jeane Kirkpatrick and Attorney 
General Edwin Meese in protest 
of the Reagan administration. 
The Michigan Student Assembly 
— a precursor to Central Student 
Government 
— 
and 
Rackham 

Student 
Government 
passed 

resolutions against the University 
inviting Bush to campus. 

In response, then University 

President Harold Shapiro pushed 
back against a restriction on 
the types of ideas considered on 
campus “because of prejudice 
or 
political 
and 
intellectual 

authoritarianism.”

At 
the 
May 
1988 
Regents 

meeting, Baker recommended the 
University’s Civil Liberties Board 
study the issue of free speech and 
offer a recommendation. 

“The time has come to regain 

control of this campus so that 
the University might once again 
function as a place of autonomy, 
civility and scholarly pursuit,” 
Baker said. 

After a recommendation from 

the CLB, the Board of Regents 
passed a five-part policy on the 
“disruption of student activities” 
in July 1988 to “advance freedom 
of speech and artistic expression.” 
The policy’s fourth part authorized 
Heatley and Pifer, the University’s 
top public safety officers, to make 
arrests but did not mean the public 
safety officers would be armed. 

“Guns in the hands of University 

personnel have no place in campus 
disputes, as experience shows,” the 
policy reads. “We do not want our 
people using guns.” 

Heatley and Pifer saw their 

first action as deputized officers at 
Duderstadt’s inauguration, where 
four students were arrested, along 
with Daily staffers Steingraber, 
Rollins, Southworth and Michael 
Fischer. The day of the ceremony, 
Ann Arbor Police Sergeant Norm 
Melby told The Daily only the most 
active protesters were arrested 
that day. 

“One officer can only make 

one arrest in some instances,” 
Melby said. “And sometimes that 
means the person who was most 
frequently warned to discontinue 
their activities.”

Meanwhile, 
the 
Michigan 

House of Representatives debated 
a bill allowing state universities 
to appoint their own deputized 
campus security officers who 
report to their Regents and the 
state. At the time, Heatley and 
Pifer were only authorized by the 
Washtenaw County Sheriff. David 

Cahill, an aide to Ann Arbor Rep. 
Perry Bullard, told The Daily 
in September 1988 that Bullard 
opposed the bill.

“He 
doesn’t 
want 
Harold 

Shapiro or (interim University 
President 
Robben) 
Fleming 

or whoever to have their own 
political police force to use against 
protesters,” Cahill said. 

Supporters of the bill, including 

Democratic 
Regent 
Thomas 

Roach, said the Ann Arbor Police 
Department was too understaffed 
to adequately help the University 
manage crime on campus. 

“There’s nothing like a police 

presence 
to 
deter 
criminal 

activity,” Roach said in the Daily 
article. 

No cops, no guns, no code
In June 1990, the Board of 

Regents proposed a full campus 
police force of 24 deputized 
officers. Some of the discussion 
focused on whether the force 
would improve campus safety, but 
the most contentious issue was 
the University’s relationship with 
the city of Ann Arbor. University 
officials concluded that the nearly 
half a million dollars spent on 
seven AAPD patrol officers and 
two detectives was unreasonably 
high given slow response times. 
City officials disputed that the 
response time was slow and said 
the University “receives more from 
the AAPD than it pays for.”

The 
vote 
to 
expand 
the 

University police force passed 6-1, 
leading to a new wave of activism 
when students returned to campus 
in the fall. A September 1990 
column in The Daily called the 
June vote “another traditional 
summer move,” undertaken while 
most students were at home and 
unable to attend Regents meetings.

In another September 1990 

Daily op-ed, Jennifer Van Valey, 
president of Michigan Student 
Assembly, urged students to protest 
the deputization. She wrote that 
the University was uninterested 
in stopping protests about issues 
unrelated to the institution, like 
foreign policy and reproductive 
rights, but that it needed control 
when protests focused on the 
“deficiencies” of the University.

“Through an analysis of the 

University’s history of pushing for 
a campus police force, it becomes 
clear that the very real problem 
of safety on campus is being 
used opportunistically to dupe 
students into supporting their own 
repression,” Van Valey said. “It is 
also clear that, ironically, the only 
way to stop the administration 
is through student mobilization 
and protest — the very thing the 
administration instituted the force 
to prevent.”

Dozens of students soon took 

up Van Valey’s call to action, 
marching to Duderstadt’s office 
to negotiate deputization on Nov. 
14, 1990. Duderstadt was not there 
that day, so the group, Students 
for a Safer Campus, occupied the 
office overnight.

Walt 
Harrison, 
executive 

director of university relations, 
told students the administration 
had no plans to negotiate on 

deputization and called the sit-in 
“political theater.”

On Regents’ Plaza outside the 

administration building, students 
held a candlelight vigil at 10 
p.m. to support those inside the 
president’s office.

“To the beat of a drum and the 

flash of office lights which were 
flicked on and off by students 
inside, approximately 100 students 
held candles and chanted, ‘No 
guns, no cops, no code,’” The Daily 
account reads. 

After more than 24 hours 

in 
Duderstadt’s 
office, 
Henry 

Johnson, 
vice 
president 
for 

community relations, met with 
the students. They demanded the 
University halt the deputization 
and arming the police force and 
take students’ voices into account. 

“The 
University 
must 

immediately institute a policy-
making body that ensures students 
will play a representative and 
powerful role in the decisions that 
affect their lives,” one demand 
read. 

Johnson offered a small number 

of students from the group a chance 
to 
meet 
with 
administrators 

after Thanksgiving. The group 
denied the offer and Johnson 
went to a back office to meet with 
Heatley, the chief of the Ann 
Arbor Police Department and 
other 
administrators. 
Heatley 

announced everyone remaining 
in the building after five minutes 
would be arrested. Jeff Hinte was 
among the 16 students who stayed 
and awaited arrest. 

“We have the rights of sea slugs 

with social security numbers,” 
Hinte said at the time. 

Police released the students 

once outside the building and 
issued 
warrants 
for 
criminal 

trespassing. During a break at the 
Regent’s meeting in November 
1990, Duderstadt said the sit-
in was “political opportunism” 
with Michigan Student Assembly 
elections on the same day.

“The students protesting are not 

representative of the community,” 
Duderstadt said. “You can’t let 
their political agenda dictate.” 

In January 1992, the Department 

of Public Safety purchased 29 
new 9-millimeter pistols, along 
with 20 cases of ammunition and 
20 magazines. Harrison said the 
increase in the officers’ budget 
meant the University was no longer 
dependent on the AAPD. 

Despite student protests, by 

September 1993, the University 
had guns, cops and a code — the 
Student Statement of Rights and 
Responsibilities governing student 
behavior. 

In a column printed in The Daily 

that month, Amitava Mazumdar 
wrote he wasn’t proud of his one-
time opposition to deputization, 
saying 
he’d 
bought 
into 
the 

“faddish 
fascists-in-Fleming 

mentality.” 

“But any sort of intellectual 

honesty requires that facts be 
examined objectively, not twisted 
or 
reconstructed 
to 
match 

(generally 
leftist) 
ideological 

preconceptions,” 
Mazumdar 

wrote. “... The predictions of 

ineffectiveness, 
costliness 
and 

repressiveness have so far proven 
false.” 

“Activism has to go on for a 

long time”

Last 
month, 
striking 
GEO 

graduate students listed several 
anti-policing demands, including 
disarmament, 
a 
50 
percent 

reduction in the DPSS budget 
and cutting ties with AAPD 
and Immigrations and Customs 
Enforcement. Rackham student 
Alejo Stark, who has been involved 
in GEO since 2013, said security 
and safety often get conflated. 

“We cannot have a safe campus 

with police on campus,” Stark said. 
“It’s also important to be clear on 
how campus police emerged. We 
have really just naturalized the fact 
that the University of Michigan 
spends $12 million on police every 
year.”

The University’s budget for 

the Department of Public Safety 
and Security for fiscal year 2020-
21 totaled nearly $12.4 million 
dollars, a decrease of $124,728 
from the year prior.

The University now has 450 

officers 
in 
DPSS 
across 
the 

three campuses, according to 
DPSS Executive Director Eddie 
Washington. The vast majority 
of DPSS branches do not carry 
weapons, Washington said, adding 
that only about 18 percent of DPSS 
officers are armed police officers. 
The other DPSS staff include 
security 
officers, 
dispatchers, 

parking enforcement officers and 
support staff, all of whom are 
unarmed.

He told The Daily that DPSS 

wants to be sure the response 
to high-level incidents such as 
interpersonal 
and 
domestic 

violence is “commensurate with 
the risk.”

“If a weapon has been reported 

and someone has been assaulted, 
we tend to send officers there 
that have the ability to use the 
least amount of force necessary, 
but also be in a position to defend 
themselves and whoever’s been 
harmed,” Washington said. 

According to records obtained 

by The Daily, DPSS fired a weapon 
just once from Aug. 2018 to Aug. 
2020, which was aimed at a deer 
that was wounded after crashing 
into a car.

Washington 
and 
Robert 

Neumann, chief of the University 
of Michigan Police Department, 
said the University was the last 
in the state and the Big Ten to 
deploy in-house police officers. 
Washington said he has resisted 
arming officers who are not sworn 
in.

“The 
police 
component 
is 

essential to bring certain comfort 
for certain communities, but it 
also brings a chilling effect to 
others and we just feel like we can 
accomplish much of what we need 
to (by) having a blended model,” 
Washington said. 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel did not directly answer 
whether 
the 
University 
is 

looking 
into 
disarming 
DPSS 

and reallocating its funding in 
an interview with The Daily on 

Thursday. He recently announced 
a task force to look into the issue of 
campus policing. 

Heather 
Young, 

communications 
director 
for 

DPSS, told The Daily in an email 
that DPSS has worked with Ann 
Arbor police to close roads for 
demonstrators to march safety at 
more than 30 protests in the last 
two months. 

“DPSS is committed to ensuring 

that all members of our community 
can safely exercise their first 
amendment rights to free speech 
and assembly,” Young wrote. 

Schlissel said he knows for many 

people, seeing a police officer they 
think has a weapon is “terrifying.”

“And not because of anything 

that police officer did, but because 
of that person’s life experiences, 
and the experiences that people 
they know and identify with 
that have engaged with police,” 
Schlissel said. “I’ve not had those 
experiences personally, but I’m 
privileged in many ways.” 

Police 
officers 
monitoring 

students is still a contentious 
point 
among 
students. 
After 

the 
University 
announced 
its 

plan to have law enforcement 
officers 
work 
with 
student 

ambassadors to enforce adherence 
to social distancing guidelines 
around 
campus, 
organizations 

representing 
students 
of 

color 
criticized 
the 
Michigan 

Ambassadors 
program, 
saying 

it neglected potential harm to 
vulnerable communities. 

In an op-ed, members of the 

Black Student Union, the United 
Asian 
American 
Organizations 

Executive Board, La Casa and the 
Arab Student Association E-Board 
called for an end to the policy.

“Michigan 
Ambassadors 

program canvassing teams rely 
on 
AAPD 
and 
DPSS, 
which 

build 
upon 
a 
historical 
and 

current legacy of police harming 
communities of color, despite 
President Schlissel’s claims that 
the 
Michigan 
Ambassadors 

program 
utilizes 
peer-to-peer 

accountability ‘to reduce the need 
for law enforcement,’” they wrote 
in the op-ed.

The 
University 
later 

discontinued 
the 
Michigan 

Ambassadors program entirely.

Steingraber said students need 

to carry on the tradition of activism 
long after they graduate.

“Student activism is almost 

always really smart and really 
provides a framework for how 
to think about local issues, but 
the leaders of campus activist 
movements then graduate and 
move 
on,” 
Steingraber 
said. 

“Activism has to go on for a long 
time.”

Department.

POLICING
From Page 1

than 
three 
weeks 
after 

her lease began, she and her 
roommates received an email 
from Varsity inquiring about 
their plans to renew their lease 
for the following year. Varsity 
gave them a Nov. 6 deadline for 
renewal. 

Waelchli 
said 
while 
she 

understands 
why 
landlords 

would want to get an early start 
to leasing, the uncertainties 
regarding the pandemic and 
whether future semesters at the 
University of Michigan will have 
in-person 
components 
make 

it more difficult to decide on a 
tight timeframe.

Waelchli said when she first 

signed the lease in November 
2019, she was excited about the 
apartment’s location because it 
meant she would be close to her 
classes. 

“Then, suddenly, there were 

no (in-person) classes, and it’s 
not something that I would have 
ever thought would happen,” 
Waelchli said. “So now I’m just 
wary to sign something early 
again.”

Waelchli 
isn’t 
alone. 

Various property management 
companies are asking tenants 
to commit to long-term plans 
in uncertain times as landlords 
move ahead with November 
deadlines for renewal.

Eric Jensen, who owns several 

rental properties in Ann Arbor, is 
among those who are continuing 
with 
a 
November 
deadline. 

Jensen emphasized that student 
demand 
helps 
maintain 
the 

unusually early leasing period 
in Ann Arbor from year to year, 
even amid the pandemic.

“It’s kind of this never-ending 

cycle that students want to get 
the best places possible,” Jensen 
said. “And so to find the best 
place as possible they start as 
early as they can to start looking. 
And if landlords want to get in on 
that cycle of when students are 
really looking, landlords have to 
be able to make their units — at 
least information about the units 
— available sooner rather than 
later.” 

In 2018-2019, the occupancy 

rate 
for 
off-campus 
student 

housing 
was 
98 
percent, 

according to a report from Triad 
Real Estate Partners.

Jon 
Keller, 
alum 
of 
the 

University and owner of his 
namesake 
company, 
which 

manages over 100 off-campus 
rentals in Ann Arbor, wrote in an 
email to The Michigan Daily that 
the November deadlines aren’t as 
early as they once were, thanks 
to a city ordinance requiring 
landlords to wait 70 days after 
the current lease period has 
passed before showing or leasing 
a property for the following year.

“When I was at U-M (2002-

2006) we would pick up our keys 

on September 1st and be forced 
to sign for the following year, 
or lose the house,” Keller wrote. 
“It was incredibly stressful for 
students — oftentimes with 
the best houses rented years 
in advance. The 70-day leasing 
ordinance allows tenants to get 
acclimated to the new house, the 
location, even their group, and 
then determine if they want to 
stay for another year.”

Before the 70-day ordinance 

was 
passed, 
landlords 
were 

technically required to wait 90 
days. Some city government 
officials have made unsuccessful 
attempts to push the leasing 
period back even further to the 
winter semester.

In addition to maintaining 

the fall leasing period deadlines, 
several 
landlords 
are 
also 

moving forward with raising 
rent for next year. Others are 
staying the course.

“In terms of what I’m doing 

with rents for next year, I’ll just 
say that I’m being consistent 
with what I’ve done in the past,” 
Jensen said. 

Oxford Companies, another 

major 
property 
management 

company in Ann Arbor, will be 
raising rent next year. Katie 
Vohwinkle, 
the 
company’s 

associate director of residential 
property, said that in order to 
be mindful of the unexpected 
economic strain imposed by the 
pandemic, the rent increases are 
lower than in years prior. 

“We understand that this year 

is a bit unique for basically all 
of us, including the students at 
the University,” Vohwinkle said. 
“Our annual rent increases are 
significantly lower this year than 
they have been in years prior, 
despite higher increases that 
the buildings and the owners 
are still receiving for taxes, 
maintenance costs, utilities, that 
kind of thing.”

Affordable housing advocates 

say a rent increase, no matter 
how small, is still a disadvantage 
to 
people 
from 
low-income 

backgrounds. 
Julia 
Goode, 

a member of the Ann Arbor 
Tenants Union, said the early 
leasing 
period 
also 
poses 

challenges for students who 
cannot depend on their parents’ 
income when deciding where to 
live. 

“It’s really impossible for 

working people to be able to 
sign a lease eight months in 
advance,” Goode said. “The only 
reason why students can really 
do it is if they have parental 
help, which many students don’t 
have. So it does really create a 
great economic unfairness that 
doesn’t have to be there.”

Keller also noted that certain 

costs 
prohibit 
freezing 
or 

lowering rent, adding that he 
believes tenants have room to 
negotiate with their landlords 
next year.

“While we would love to 

keep rents flat on renewals or 

even lower them at times, the 
carrying costs like property 
taxes, utilities, lawn and snow 
care, maintenance and insurance 
rates go up every year,” Keller 
wrote. “It would be difficult to 
lock in a rate for too long a period 
and continue to make money 
… All that being said, there is 
probably more room than in 
previous years to negotiate a 
more attractive renewal rate.”

Advocates 
for 
affordable 

housing have voiced opposition 
to the early leasing practice in 
the name of tenant rights as 
well as issues of access for low-
income students.

LSA senior Lindsay Calka 

said the early leasing period 
puts students in a compromising 
situation, many of whom are 
unaware of their rights as 
tenants.

“I think a lot of landlords take 

advantage of that (early leasing 
period) and put their tenants 
in a position where they have 
to make decisions,” Calka said. 
“They’re able to hike up rent or 
change things about … the lease 
that maybe tenants wouldn’t be 
wanting to do or (would) want 
time to bargain on, or at least 
have discussion on.”

Jennifer 
Hall, 
executive 

director of the Ann Arbor 
Housing Commission, echoed 
these concerns. She said certain 
decisions in the University’s 
power affect the housing market 
and can limit accessibility for 

low-income students.

“The U-M has a significant 

impact on the local housing 
market through the number of 
students they admit and enroll, 
the number of housing units 
they provide, the number of staff 
that they hire and the properties 
they purchase and develop,” 
Hall wrote in an email to The 
Daily. “As a U-M alumna and 
local resident, I think the U-M 
needs to be more proactive about 
providing housing at a reduced 
cost to low-income students.”

Both Goode and Calka said 

they 
see 
opportunities 
for 

students to organize and assert 
their rights in the present 
moment.

Goode pointed to the Graduate 

Employees’ 
Organization’s 

advocacy around housing as 
providing a model for other 
students to follow. GEO also 
recently 
went 
on 
strike 
to 

demand the University provide 
increased 
protections 
for 

graduate students with partial 
success.

Goode also said she hopes 

students registered to vote in 
Ann Arbor will vote in favor of 
the affordable housing millage 
on the ballot in November 
because the funds will help 
address the demand for more 
housing.

LEASE
From Page 1


The 
candidates 
discussed 

the 
University’s 
COVID-19 

response, tuition increases, sexual 
misconduct 
investigations 
and 

systemic racism, among other 
issues.

The election will fill two open 

seats on the board. Incumbent 
Regent 
Shauna 
Ryder 
Diggs 

(D) was joined by three-time 
candidate Carl Meyers (R) and 
first-time 
candidate 
Michael 

Mawilai (Green) at the forum. Each 
candidate gave a brief overview of 
their platform before responding 
to a series of questions from 
Colleen 
Conway, 
moderator 

of the event and chair of the 
Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs.

Much of the conversation at 

the forum focused on the board’s 
role in holding the University’s 
administration 
accountable 

for 
both 
transparency 
and 

communication with the greater 
community. When asked about 
responding to sexual misconduct 
allegations 
against 
former 

University 
Provost 
Martin 

Philbert and the late University 
Health Service Director Robert 
Anderson, Ryder Diggs advocated 
for bringing in external experts 
and 
spoke 
to 
the 
board’s 

responsibility to the public and to 
the University.

“I believe the board’s role 

is critical with issues such as 
Philbert and Dr. Anderson because 
these types of issues affect the 

entire institution, affect trust, 
transparency 
and 
obviously 

affect risk — the risk profile of the 
University,” Ryder Diggs said. “I 
believe the board’s role is to assist 
with bringing in independent 
outside experts to work with our 
internal teams to take a broad 
look.”

Mawilai 
advocated 
for 

conducting 
investigations 

internally when possible. Meyers 
seconded Ryder Digg’s proposal, 
suggesting that the University 
should bring in outside experts in 
these types of investigations.

The three candidates expressed 

their disapproval of University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

response 
to 
the 
COVID-19 

pandemic. Mawilai referenced the 
Graduate Employees’ Organization 
protests last month, criticizing the 
University’s reopening process.

“I think we really should’ve 

erred more on the side of caution, 
make 
sure 
that 
everybody’s 

onboard and not try to steamroll 
a reopening before we had all the 
plans in place where everybody 
knew what they had to do,” 
Mawilai said.

Meyers said the University’s 

reopening 
plan 
was 
unclear, 

emphasizing 
the 
board’s 

responsibility 
in 
holding 
the 

administration accountable. Ryder 
Diggs said it is important to create 
a clear plan early on, modifying it 
as we learn more about the virus 
and gathering input from a variety 
of voices on campus.

The candidates also discussed 

the University’s 1.9% increase in 

tuition for the 2020-2021 school 
year. Ryder Diggs said she voted 
twice against the tuition increase 
and suggested that the University 
could afford not to increase tuition 
in the upcoming school year. 
Mawilai spoke to the importance 
of providing the best value for 
students’ 
education 
and 
also 

advocated to minimize tuition 
increases.

Meyers, whose platform is 

largely based in higher education 
affordability, promised one of 
his first proposals would be to 
roll back the increase and freeze 
tuition.

“The cost of higher education 

has stifled diversity and stifled 
inclusion 
where 
folks 
look 

elsewhere,” Meyers said. “I think 
the budget needs to be controlled, 
especially during this COVID 
period. The University is in the 
most serious financial challenge 
in its modern history right now 
and they chose to raise tuition 
where students get a diminished 
experience … it was wrong.”

Other topics included systemic 

racism and proposals to cut police 
funding. All three candidates 
acknowledged the existence of 
systemic racism and the necessity 
of taking steps to eradicate it. None 
said they would defund campus 
police. 

Ryder Diggs and Meyers argued 

the University should allocate 
more resources to the Division of 
Public Safety and Security. 

Ten thousand free, reusable 

masks will be given to low-
income 
communities 
and 

the elderly, the Washtenaw 
County Office of Community 
and 
Economic 
Development 

announced in a press release 
Tuesday. 

The masks will be distributed 

throughout 
the 
county, 

including at 12 locations in 
Ann Arbor. The program stems 
from an executive order Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer signed in 
August to provide 4 million 
free masks throughout the 
state of Michigan. 

OCED 
Administrative 

Assistant David Beck, who 
works 
closely 
with 
the 

distribution 
sites 
for 
the 

program, said masks will be 
vital as residents brace for 
colder 
weather 
and 
more 

indoor activities. 

“Our hope is to be able to 

get the masks out, to be able 
to distribute them and have 
people prepared for winter, and 
not be scrambling during the 
winter to provide masks” Beck 
said. 

Beck said the county has 

been informally distributing 
free masks to residents for 
months.

“Originally there were masks 

that people were selling and 
were making that they were 
donating to us,” Beck said. “If 
anyone needed a mask we tried 
to deliver it to them, or they 
were able to come to our office 
to pick it up.” 

Beck 
said 
the 
state 

government’s 
donation 
of 

10,000 masks has formalized 
the distribution project, and 
the program aims to reach as 
many people conveniently as 
possible. 

“Even acquiring masks, and 

particularly reusable masks, 
may not be as easy for some 
people in our community than 
others,” Beck said. “For senior 
citizens who might not have 
transportation to go to certain 
places to buy masks, for those 
who maybe don’t have the 
disposable incomes to be able 
to find masks.” 

The 
pandemic 
has 

shown 
that 
COVID-19 
has 

disproportionately 
impacted 

specific communities, such as 
low-income families, African 
Americans and senior citizens, 
more than others. 

Beck said OCED has been 

doing important work for these 
communities, including using 
donations and funding to help 
with utilities and rent during 
the economic shutdown and 
the current recovery. Beck said 
the free mask program is an 
extension of this work.

Though 
the 
free 
mask 

program is in response to 
COVID-19, 
Beck 
said 
the 

community connections forged 
through 
its 
implementation 

could be useful towards other 
initiatives going forward.

“Finding new organizations 

and new places and new groups 
to be able to work with, I think 
will be the broader impact,” 
Beck said. “Hopefully, God 
forbid, if anything like this 
happens again … the network 
that’s already in place will be 
strengthened. We’’ll be able to 
start networking out to other 
organizations and partnering 
with other organizations to be 
able to help provide services 
and other resources as we can.”

Jennifer 
Howard 
is 
the 

director of the Turner Senior 
Wellness Program, one of the 
mask distribution sites in Ann 
Arbor. She works closely with 
the elderly in the area.

“When COVID hit, we had 

to shut everything down, all 
of our programming was in 
person and we couldn’t safely 
bring anybody into the center,” 
Howard said. “The thing that is 
really tough on our community 
is the socialization, and some 
of the isolation that has come 
from this.”

Carolina 
Barillas 
is 
a 

Manchester resident who works 
as a nanny for a doctor’s family. 
Barillas said she has been living 
on a stretched budget due to 
the pandemic. Since she was 
laid off for the majority of the 
summer, Barillas said she has 
been closely budgeting and 
watching her money.

Barillas said she thought 

the free mask program was 

an important offering to the 
county. 

“I’m an essential worker and 

I’m in the high risk category, 
and I have to go out and work,” 
Barillas said. “I think they 
should be free ... It’s a lot less 
stressful, with my very limited 
funds.” 

Barillas said it was vital 

for the entire community to 
practice wearing masks.

“It’s your civic duty to wear 

a mask,” Barillas said. “To 
show that you care about other 
people.” 

In the past few months, 

the center has been able to 
reopen a few days a week and 
begin providing some of these 
community services, such as 
exercise 
programs, 
cooking 

classes and other social events, 
in 
conjunction 
with 
their 

online efforts. Howard said the 
free mask program will help 
the center be able to stay open 
and keep operations running. 

“We do have a lot of our folks 

who do not have the resources 
to purchase the masks that 
they need, the PPE, that kind 
of thing,” Howard said. “So 
this is a really great way for us 
to have those masks on hand 
available for them, not only to 
use within our center but to 
use for anywhere else that they 
might go.”

Public Health senior Emily 

Guo is the co-president of 
CURIS Public Health Advocacy, 
a 
student 
organization 
on 

campus that works to enact 
public health efforts in the 
local 
community. 
She 
said 

affordable, 
reusable 
masks 

are important for low-income 
communities. 

“(Wearing a mask) is one of 

the most cost-effective primary 
prevention strategies for the 
communities so you don’t have 
to rely on coming in later, 
which is more expensive,” Guo 
said. “(Some people benefitting 
from the program) have to have 
in-person contact, which is the 
case for a lot of low-income 
communities.”

When students returned to 

campus in August amid the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
many 

socialized outdoors at a safe 
distance. 
As 
the 
weather 

becomes 
colder, 
students 

are faced with an important 
question: how can they socialize 
now?

Rackham 
student 
John 

Gearig said he’s worried about 
colder weather, as he doesn’t 
think it’ll be as safe to spend 
time with friends indoors. 

“If weather permits, I prefer 

to be with people outdoors, but 
it’s not very possible,” Gearig 
said. 

In a normal year, students get 

exercise when walking short 
distances to class and to meet 
with friends. As temperatures 
drop, 
this 
becomes 
less 

common, 
especially 
since 

most students have many of 
their 
classes 
online. 
Preeti 

Malani, University of Michigan 
chief health officer, said she 
encourages students to continue 

spending time outside even 
when the temperature drops.

“Even when it’s colder, it is 

still important for your overall 
health to try and get outside,” 
Malani said. “There’s a saying 
that there’s no bad weather, 
there’s just inadequate clothing. 
Not to say that you can spend 
hours and hours outside in the 
winter months, but definitely 
find ways to be outside when it’s 
possible.”

Because common areas in 

the residence halls are closed, 
students tend to rely on the few 
buildings open on campus to 
connect with each other and get 
out of the cold. LSA freshman 
Lauren Wittek said students are 
told to follow social distancing 
requirements in these indoor 
spaces.

“Most of the time that my 

friends and I are inside, it’s in 
the Union, so we have to have 
our masks on,” Wittek said. 

When spending time together 

indoors, Malani said wearing a 
mask and maintaining distance 
will prevent the spread of the 
virus.

“Indoors you can still get 

together, it’s just a matter of 
maintaining 
some 
distance 

and wearing a mask,” Malani 
said. “One of the concerns is 
that students won’t follow the 
guidance (of density limits), but 
I have no doubt that the students 
will follow the guidance. If you 
can have a mask on and can be 
in closer proximity, you want to 
try to maintain that six feet if 
you can, and you want to have a 
well-ventilated room.”

University contact tracers 

have identified six COVID-19 
clusters in the residence halls. 
Though some attribute this to 
the shared common areas and 
restrooms in communal living 
spaces, Malani said most of this 
spread is through social contact. 

“I would say that people in 

congregate housing are at risk 
just because they can be in 
settings with large numbers of 
people, but living there itself is 
not a higher risk,” Malani said.

Students 
in 
asynchronous 

classes said the transition back 
to school has been especially 
difficult. Without a structured 
schedule and classes meeting 
regularly, students said they face a 
new challenge in managing their 
time. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Melanie 

Esterine, whose only synchronous 
classes are small discussions, 
said 
she 
struggled 
with 

procrastination at first while 
adjusting to the unconventional 
semester. 

“In the beginning, it was really 

difficult because I feel like when 
you don’t have a set schedule to 
stick with, you just do things 
whenever, and then you keep 
putting it off and then it becomes 
a mess,” Esterine said. 

Now that she has settled 

into the semester, Esterine has 
discovered a few tricks to help her 
stay organized and on track with 
her school work. 

“I’ve started to try and develop 

my own schedule that works best 
for me that consists of doing a lot 
of stuff on Monday and Tuesday 
and then maybe taking it easier 
on the other days,” Esterine said. 
“That’s been helping me a lot. I 
would say that I’ve gotten used to 
it now.”

LSA senior Dawson Wells 

said he has conflicting opinions 
about 
asynchronous 
lectures. 

Even though his asynchronous 
lectures have given him more 

independence, they also have 
some drawbacks.

“Without having that structure 

built-in, it’s a lot harder to stay 
motivated and to stay caught up 
and not have a night where I have 
four lectures to watch before my 
exam,” Wells said. 

However, Engineering junior 

Carolyn 
Melvin 
said 
she 
is 

actually a fan of asynchronous 
classes. 
Having 
pre-recorded 

lectures allows her to watch them 
at both a convenient time and a 
suitable pace. 

“To be honest, the transition to 

asynchronous lectures has been 
better than expected,” Melvin 
said. “A lot of my classes in the 
past had recorded lectures which 
I have always liked because I 
can speed up or slow down the 
lectures.” 

 Since she is unable to see the 

other students and communicate 
with them, Melvin said she feels 
isolated 
while 
watching 
her 

asynchronous lectures.

“When it comes to interacting 

with other students in class, this 
has been much tougher,” Melvin 
said. “It is easy to feel alone in 
classes and not know how to get 
help.” 

LSA senior Tikvah Finn said 

she feels as though the workload 
is heavier with asynchronous 
classes, which are more difficult 
for her with the additional 
responsibility of watching over 
her child. 

“Virtual learning, as necessary 

as it is during this pandemic, has 
led to a significantly increased 

workload as a student,” Finn 
said. “Compared to a previous 
17-credit, in-person semester, I 
have to spend more time watching 
virtual lectures and studying 
outside of class time during this 
13-credit online semester.”

Music, 
Theater 
& 
Dance 

sophomore 
Andrew 
Kevic 

voiced the same criticisms as 
Finn. Kevic said he has also had 
more work this semester due 
to asynchronous lectures and 
virtual learning. Coupled with his 
other responsibilities outside the 
classroom, Kevic said he finds it 
challenging to manage his time. 

“I think it kind of changes the 

balance of my whole schedule, 
especially because I have work 
study and I have another job on 
top of that, so I have to really 
think about how I spend my time,” 
Kevic said. 

Kevic 
said 
even 
though 

asynchronous 
classes 
have 

made it more difficult for him to 
have a regular schedule, he has 
also found that there are some 
benefits. In learning how to better 
manage his time, Kevic said he 
has acquired a new skill. 

“It’s been a lot more of a 

challenge, 
but 
in 
ways 
it’s 

been 
more 
rewarding 
than 

last semester, especially since 
quarantine,” Kevic said. “I’ve 
noticed that I’ve had a lot more 
control of my time and I’ve been 
able to kind of shape my day, every 
day.”

Seven men charged under state terrorism law plot

Michigan Attorney General 

Dana Nessel charged seven 
men under the state’s anti-
terrorism 
law 
for 
their 

involvement in a plot to kidnap 
Michigan 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer 
and 
violently 

overthrow the government. 
The charges, which Nessel 
announced 
Thursday, 
come 

after months of high-profile 
disputes over the governor’s 
use of executive power to fight 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic 

and a series of protests in 
opposition 
to 
her 
orders, 

some of which brought armed 
demonstrators to the Michigan 
State Capitol. 

Six 
additional 
men 
also 

face federal charges, which 
were unsealed Thursday. The 
suspects have been taken into 
custody and the investigation 
is ongoing.

The 
group 
planned 
to 

kidnap Whitmer and move 
her to a “secure location” in 
Wisconsin to face “trial.” They 
also wanted more than 200 
men to storm the Michigan 
Capitol and made threats to 
instigate a civil war. They 
planned on creating a “self-
sufficient” society. 

The state charges included 

felony counts of threat of 
terrorism, gang membership, 
providing material support for 
terrorist acts and carrying or 

possessing a firearm during a 
felony. At a press conference, 
Nessel said there has been an 
increase in anti-government 
rhetoric and groups embracing 
extremist ideologies.

“Our 
efforts 
uncovered 

elaborate plans to endanger 
the lives of law enforcement 
officers, government officials 
and 
the 
broader 
public,” 

Nessel said. “The multi-front 
operation to apprehend the 
suspects 
in 
question 
was 

carefully 
coordinated 
and 

skillfully executed.”

According 
to 
the 
FBI’s 

criminal complaint, the men 
had been plotting with a 
Michigan 
militia 
group 
at 

least since July to kidnap 
the 
Democratic 
governor, 

and had performed combat 
drills, obtained firearms and 
attempted to make explosives. 
The group had also attempted 
to obtain addresses of law 
enforcement officers to target 
them. 

The 
FBI 
intercepted 

encrypted 
messages 
earlier 

this 
year 
and 
relied 
on 

undercover 
agents 
and 

informants 
working 
within 

the group. 

According to the federal 

complaint, Michigan residents 
Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Kaleb 
Franks, Daniel Harris and 
Brandon Caserta along with 
Delaware 
resident 
Barry 

Croft 
have 
been 
charged 

with conspiring to kidnap the 
governor. 

Nessel 
charged 
seven 

additional men, all of whom 
are residents of Michigan. Paul 
Bellar, age 21 of Milford, faces 
three felony counts: providing 
material support for terrorist 
acts, 
gang 
membership, 

carrying 
or 
possessing 
a 

firearm during the commission 
of a felony. 

Shaun 
Fix, 
age 
38 
of 

Belleville; Eric Molitor, age 36 
of Cadillac; Michael Null, age 
36 of Plainwell; and William 
Null, age 38 of Shelbyville, face 
two felony counts: providing 
material support for terrorist 
acts, carrying or possessing a 
firearm during the commission 
of a felony. 

Pete Musico and Joseph 

Morrison, both age 42 and who 
live together in Munith, face 
four felony counts: one count 
each of threat of terrorism, 
one 
count 
each 
of 
gang 

membership, one count each of 
providing support of terrorist 
acts and one count each of 
possessing a firearm during 
the commission of a felony. 

Whitmer 
faced 
criticism 

from conservative lawmakers 
and right-wing groups after 
enacting emergency executive 
orders 
related 
to 
COVID-

19. In April, hundreds of 
demonstrators 
gathered 
in 

Lansing, 
Mich. 
to 
protest 

the 
governor’s 
stay-at-

home orders. Many of these 
protesters 
were 
openly 

carrying firearms, which is 
legal in the Michigan Capitol. 

The 
Michigan 
Supreme 

Court 
recently 
ruled 
that 

Whitmer 
overstepped 
her 

authority in issuing executive 
orders 
related 
to 
COVID-

19 precautions beyond April 
30, saying the law she used 
to justify her actions was 
unconstitutional. The status 
of state regulations remains 
in limbo, with some local 
governments working to fill in 
the gaps. 

Whitmer 
maintains 

her executive orders were 
justified, as they aimed to save 
lives and protect people from 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 

One study found that the 
governor’s 
stay-at-home 

orders may have saved tens of 
thousands of lives in the state.

At 
a 
press 
conference 

Thursday, 
Whitmer 
said 

she had anticipated facing 
challenges 
as 
governor 
of 

Michigan, but said she “never 
could have imagined anything 
like this.” She thanked federal 
and state law enforcement for 
their work, adding that she 
hoped the charges will lead to 
convictions that bring “these 
sick and depraved men to 
justice.”

Whitmer also condemned 

President 
Donald 
Trump 

for failing to rebuke white 
supremacists 
and 
said 

Trump’s inability to address 
the 
pandemic 
was 
the 

result 
of 
ignoring 
public 

health guidance. In April, 
Trump tweeted “LIBERATE 

MICHIGAN!” in response to 
Whitmer’s efforts to limit the 
spread of COVID-19.

“Our head of state has 

spent the last seven months 
denying science, ignoring his 
own health experts, stoking 
distrust, 
fomenting 
anger 

and giving comfort to those 
who spread fear and hatred 
and division,” Whitmer said. 
“Just last week, the president 
of the United States stood 
before the American people 
and refused to condemn white 
supremacists and hate groups 
like 
these 
two 
Michigan 

militia groups.”

At a presidential debate on 

Sept. 29, Trump declined to 
denounce white supremacists 
and 
directed 
a 
far-right 

extremist group to “stand back 
and stand by.”

“Hate groups heard the 

president’s words not as a 
rebuke but as a rallying cry, as 
a call to action,” Whitmer said.

Andrew Birge, U.S. attorney 

for the Western District of 
Michigan, 
said 
the 
group 

used code words and phrases 
to avoid detection by law 
enforcement and conducted 
surveillance on the governor’s 
vacation home. Two of the 
men discussed planting and 
detonating explosives to deter 
law enforcement. He also said 
the men could face up to life in 
prison if convicted. 

Joseph Gasper, colonel of 

the Michigan State Police, said 
the MSP will take swift action 

against anyone planning or 
seeking to commit violence in 
the state.

“This case is one of the 

largest cases in recent history 
that 
the 
MSP 
has 
been 

involved in,” Gasper said. “I 
think that the nature of this 
case is rather unprecedented, 
but it does send a very vivid 
reminder that while we may be 
in a time period of discourse, 
possibly even divisiveness and 
fighting across the nation, law 
enforcement stands united.”

Whitmer 
said 
the 

restrictions initiated during 
the COVID-19 pandemic were 
necessary to stop more people 
from getting sick. Michigan 
has had more than 6,800 
deaths from coronavirus since 
March.

“As 
painful 
as 
these 

losses are, our hard work 
and 
sacrifices 
have 
saved 

thousands of lives. We have 
one of the strongest economic 
recoveries 
in 
the 
nation,” 

Whitmer 
said. 
“Make 
no 

mistake, there will be more 
hard days ahead, but I want the 
people of Michigan to know 
this — as your governor, I will 
never stop doing everything in 
my power to keep you and your 
family safe.”

Keith 
Soster, 
director 

of 
student 
engagement 
of 

MDining, said he has always 
been 
a 
sustainability 
geek. 

However, working in this role 
heightened 
his 
interest 
in 

MDining’s efforts to merge 
food and sustainability. 

MDining’s 
latest 

sustainability collaboration is 
with Michigan Apple Crunch, 
a regional program focused on 
promoting the consumption of 
the Midwest’s local produce. 
The program began about six 
years ago.

“It’s an opportunity for us 

to celebrate all the different 
foods that we can grow in the 
Midwest,” Soster said.

Michigan 
is 
the 
second 

most crop diverse state in the 
country, just behind California. 

Soster said students of all 

ages can open up their minds to 
what is possible as far as local 
and seasonal food. He wants 
to change people’s tendency 
to gravitate toward the “most 
perfect apple” when walking 
into stores like Kroger. 

Soster referenced a student 

group blind taste test several 
years 
ago 
where 
students 

sampled two apples — one from 
Kroger, the “perfect” apple, and 
the local one with blemishes. 
Blindfolded, everybody chose 
the local and sustainable apple. 

“When we buy local and eat 

local and sustainable food, it’s 
gonna taste a whole lot better,” 
Soster said. 

The Michigan Apple Crunch 

initiative is just one example 
of ways that people can engage 
with the local harvest. Getting 
students involved with food 
sustainability 
on 
campus 

is 
really 
about 
increasing 

awareness, Soster said. 

“Being able to show in their 

dining halls where the food 
that is grown at the campus is 
utilized in our menu, I think is 
important, too,” Soster said. 

Public Policy senior Grace 

Hermann, who studies food 
systems 
and 
agricultural 

policy, said programs like this 
could help college students 
learn more about sustainable 
food practices.

“I grew up in a house where 

we ate meat nearly every day and 

never really considered what 
the implications of that were 
until I got to college,” Hermann 
said. “I also think that a lot of 
students may lack knowledge 
surrounding diets that are not 
focused around meat, may not 
have been exposed to certain 
foods or may have just never 
considered how their diet and 
consumption habits play a role 
in environmental issues.”

LSA junior Brian Devorkin 

works with Soster to bring 
this 
knowledge 
of 
food 

sustainability and wellness to 
the student body, partnering 
with local farmers to build 
relationships. He said Soster’s 
passion helps fuel students’ 
interest in sustainability.

“They 
build 
the 

(relationships) because of the 
personalities they bring to the 
table, and just the connections 
and 
the 
professionalism,” 

Devorkin said. “The chefs are 
just awesome. He (Soster) has 
so many connections and so 
many people that would love 
to help out, and just love his 
mission.”

Though 
Michigan 
Apple 

Crunch 
is 
MDining’s 

latest 
project, 
the 
team’s 

sustainability and food security 
initiatives have been in motion 
for years. Others include the 
Campus Farm, founded in 2012, 
and Sustainable Mondays. 

Hermann 
lived 
in 
East 

Quad 
Residence 
Hall 

her first two years at the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

and 
praised 
Sustainable 

Mondays for introducing more 
environmentally 
friendly 

options to the dining halls. 

“Efforts 
like 
that 
by 

MDining 
to 
decrease 
meat 

consumption 
and 
provide 

students 
with 
alternative 

options 
are 
important 
as 

well,” Hermann said. “Based 
on 
my 
conversations 
with 

folks from MDining from my 
class, I believe they also try 
to source from local farmers 
when possible, which is good 
for our local economy as well. 
Though UMich is far from 
perfect, all of these efforts do 
help the University be a better 
community member.”

Another challenge is making 

sustainable food options more 
widely available for students 
regardless 
of 
socioeconomic 

background. 
This 
included 

adding 
paid 
positions 
to 

Campus 
Farm, 
therefore 

allowing low-income students 
to become involved in campus 
food sustainability.

In the past year, Soster helped 

spearhead the North Campus 
Food Distribution program, an 
effort to make food access more 
equitable across the University 
and decrease food insecurity. 

Another initiative is the Food 

Recovery Network, a nonprofit 
dedicated 
to 
recovering 

leftover food from university 
dining halls and donating it to 
local food banks.

“Any leftover food is basically 

used,” Devorkin said. “It’s not 
thrown away. They kind of 
limit that waste.”

One 
of 
MDining’s 
latest 

iniiatives is carbon tracking and 
identifying the carbon value of 
MDining’s menu items. In 2019, 
Ann Arbor City Council passed 
a resolution to reach carbon 
neutrality by 2030.

“There’s lots of work to 

be done across the campus 
community,” Soster said. “But 
I think dining can lead the way 
and model the behavior that we 

hope others will jump on to.”

Hermann 
worries 
about 

how sustainable food practices 
are often overlooked in favor 
of mass production, echoing 
Soster’s hope for a shift towards 
seasonal and local produce. 

“I think it is really important 

that when we talk about food 
sustainability we approach it 
not just from an environmental 
standpoint, 
but 
also 
from 

an 
economic 
and 
social 

standpoint,” 
Hermann 
said. 

“Food that is truly sustainable 
should also positively support 
our local economies, as well as 
the health, safety and economic 
well-being 
of 
workers 
and 

consumers.” 

Soster and Devorkin said 

MDining’s efforts to create 
more sustainable food practices 
are worth the years of slow 
progress. 

“I 
want 
to 
leave 
my 

contributions to the world and 
my children in a better way 
than I found them,” Soster said. 
“I know that sounds kind of 
corny, but it’s true.”

Board of Commissioners candidates present platforms

Three nominees participate in event hosted by League of Women Voters, discuss plans to address inequality and COVID-19

Candidates 
for 
the 

Washtenaw County Board of 
Commissioners detailed their 
platforms in videos uploaded 
Tuesday. 
They 
discussed 

priorities for the county amid 
the COVID-19 pandemic and 
pressing issues facing local 
governments.

The 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Central 
Campus 

and the surrounding area are 
represented by Commissioner 
Jason Morgan, D-District 8, 
who is running for reelection 
and 
currently 
serves 
as 

the chair of the Board of 
Commissioners.

The videos were posted by the 

League of Women Voters of the 
Ann Arbor Area, a nonpartisan 
organization 
aiming 
to 

increase participation in local 
government and educate people 
on the democratic process.

Morgan is running against 

epublican Joan Knoertzer, who 
was invited but did not attend 
the 
event. 
The 
candidates 

challenging 
Commissioner 

Katie Scott, D-District 9, who 
is up for reelection in District 
9, 
and 
Democrat 
Caroline 

Sanders, who is running in 
District 4, did not attend the 
event either. Because Morgan, 
Scott and Sanders did not have 
opponents present to debate, 
they participated together in 
one event. 

Douglas Allen moderated the 

conversation.

“The world has changed a 

great deal since most of you 
decided to run for office,” Allen 
said. “The global pandemic, 
ensuing economic collapse and 
more recently the Black Lives 
Matter Movement have focused 
attention on how these matters 
highlight the disproportionate 
burdens shouldered by the poor, 
the elderly and communities of 
color. These present challenges 
to government at all levels.” 

Morgan said the board is 

trying to accelerate its work 
to address inequality. He said 
he has a series of priorities he 
hopes to address in the future, 
among them addressing climate 
change and confronting social 
and racial injustice.

“I think the budget is where 

we do that work,” Morgan 
said. “... It sometimes makes 
things 
uncomfortable 
when 

we say we need to really truly 
address racial inequity and 
reallocate some funds from 
some areas of the county, but I 
think that’s what we’re talking 
about here and how we achieve 
real, structural change in our 
community going forward.” 

Scott, who also represents 

parts of Ann Arbor, is the 
current 
Ways 
and 
Means 

Chair. She said many of the 
most pressing issues the board 
will face following the COVID-
19 pandemic are related to the 
budget. Scott said feedback 
from county residents will be 
essential in putting the budget 
together.

“I’m not the first person 

to say this, but I believe the 
budget is a moral document 
and we will have to be thinking 
about what our morals are, 
what our priorities are, to do 
that budget,” Scott said.

Sanders 
said 
resource 

allocation will be a pivotal 
issue.

“We will have to put greater 

emphasis on the priority of 
putting people first and in 
making sure that we not only in 
word but in deed prove by our 
actions and our allocations that 
we are interested in protecting 
those 
that 
are 
the 
most 

vulnerable first and others as 
needed,” Sanders said.

Morgan 
discussed 

Michigan’s ongoing challenges 
with clean water, particularly 
with 
toxic 
per- 
and 

polyfluoroalkyl 
substances, 

also known as PFAS. 

PFAS, which has been found 

in 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 

water supply, is a group of 
manmade 
chemicals 
used 

in 
manufacturing. 
These 

chemicals can cause a variety 
of 
negative 
health 
effects, 

including cancer and changes 
in the immune system. 

“I 
think 
the 
protection 

of our water is the biggest 
environmental 
concern 
in 

our community at this time,” 
Morgan said. 

The 
participants 
also 

discussed 
homelessness 
in 

Washtenaw County. In March, 
when 
COVID-19 
began 
to 

spread, the county paid for hotel 
rooms for people experiencing 
housing 
insecurity. 
Morgan 

said he would work to continue 
this support.

“The 
biggest 
thing 
is 

ensuring that we have a way 
to keep those who are in our 
shelters safe and fed … We’re 
still working on it but I’ve heard 
the message from residents 
loud and clear that we need to 
keep our homeless community 
safe,” Morgan said. 

In her closing statement, 

Scott said she is passionate 

about her work in the county 
and advocating for people.

“One of the things this 

pandemic has really shown 
us is the underpinnings of 
inequality in not only our 
country, but in our county as 
well,” Scott said. 

Morgan said his personal 

experiences 
informed 
his 

approach to governing.

“The one thing we don’t 

really get to do as public 
officials as often as you would 
think is share who we are as 
people,” Morgan said. “... As 
a young LGBTQ individual 
growing up in this community 
… paired with growing up with 
a disability has shaped a lot 
of my experiences and how I 
approach 
government. 
And 

it’s really the reason I am here 
doing this job today. I am here 
because I care about making 
people’s lives better.”

A growing trend has caught 

the attention of U.S. politicians 
and no, it’s not Qanon. It’s the 
rise in the number of Latinx vot-
ers, which political pundits refer 
to as the Latino Vote. The Latino 
Vote is an elusive creature that 
many politicians have tried and 
failed to catch, insisting on trap-
ping it, but failing to realize that 
it’s less like a fish and more like 
the Loch Ness Monster: It isn’t 
real. The Latino Vote is a gross 
generalization of Central and 
South Americans that ignores 
the diversity of thoughts and 
values within such a varied 
body of people; there is no one 
“Latino Vote.” The narrative 
perpetuated by the media that 
all Latinx voters vote straight 
ticket blue is incorrect for sev-
eral reasons and harmful to any 
campaign that believes in it. 

My mother and my uncle 

immigrated from Ecuador as 
children. When they moved, 
they both did not know Eng-
lish and went through the ESL 
program in their public school. 
They both attended the Univer-
sity of Michigan. Though they 
had the same upbringing and 
same 
immigrant 
experience, 

they could not be further apart 
in ideology. My mother is a mod-
erate, Elizabeth Warren type 
of Democrat. My uncle is a rag-
ing Independent that responds 
positively towards Trump-like 
politicians. After the comments 
Trump made about Mexico 
sending rapists and criminals, 
I assumed my uncle would be 
offended by the situation. He 
was not. This experience dis-
plays several issues with the 
myth of the Latino Vote. Though 
there are common experiences, 
such as immigration, ESL and 
cuisine, Latinx voters do not 
always view themselves as a 
uniform group. Rather than 
identifying as Latinx, some 
will refer to themselves spe-
cifically as Chilean or Puerto 
Rican. Within these identifica-
tions, there are values held that 

are not held by the rest of the 
community. For instance, fifty-
eight percent of Cubans identify 
as Republican in comparison 
to thirty-eight percent of non-
Cuban Hispanics. This disparity 
can be attributed to the issues 
each group prioritizes; accord-
ing to the Pew Research Center, 
Cuban voters consider foreign 
policy, health care and violent 
crimes more than non-Cuban 
Hispanics. Foriegn policy is a 
major issue for Cubans, because 
a hardline foreign policy against 
Cuba means that Cubans have 
a harder time visiting family 
still on the island. This is not as 
much of a problem with non-
Cuban Latinx as U.S. foreign 
policy with Cuba changes more 
frequently in comparison to 
other Central and South Ameri-
can countries. 

Latinx voters also hold vary-

ing positions on social issues. 
Religion is an important fac-
tor that affects voting pat-
terns for the Latino Vote. More 
Latinx Americans are actively 
religious (i.e. going to service 
regularly) as compared to their 
non-Latinx counterparts. Typi-
cally identifying as Christian, 
many consider criminalization 
of abortion to be a crucial aspect 
of the party they are voting for; 
older Latinxs hold anti-abortion 
views to a much larger degree as 
compared to younger Latinxs. 
This creates a separation over 
this single issue alone. Across 
the board, Latinxs identify as 
liberal significantly more than 
other 
non-Latin 
Americans 

and are considered equally as 
accepting of the LGBTQ+ com-
munity as non-Latin Americans. 
Considering the variation in 
views of these different social 
issues, it is hard to determine 
what factors sway the Latino 
Vote right or left. 

As we move forward into the 

election cycle, it’s important 
that politicians consider all the 
oversights that come from cat-
egorizing the Latinx population 
into one vote. As diverse as the 
community is, the views within 
are even more diverse and have 
the power to greatly impact the 
outcome of the election. 

Before beginning this piece, 

I want to recognize that I am 
speaking from a position of privi-
lege; my family has benefitted 
from the caste system for genera-
tions, and many of the opportuni-
ties we have been afforded are not 
as easily accessible for some. In 
writing this piece, I do not intend 
to speak for or over a community 
that I do not belong to. My main 
purpose is to raise awareness 
about the detriments of the caste 
system in today’s day and age. 

--
On Sept. 14, a Dalit woman in 

the northern Indian state of Uttar 
Pradesh was gang raped by four 
men. Two weeks later, she died 
from the severity of her injuries. 
The men were identified as being 
from upper castes, with a his-
tory of violence targeted towards 
minority groups in the Indian 
community. As of this past Thurs-
day, the investigators claimed 
that “she was not raped” and the 
woman’s body was reported to 
be cremated without her fam-
ily’s consent. The caste system 
has been integrated into Hindu 
society for centuries, forcing the 
community into an abstract hier-
archy that determines how a per-
son is treated in the world, both 
in their personal lives as well as 
professionally. While some fami-
lies do not consider their caste 
any longer, many still refuse to 
marry outside of their caste and 
hold this classification as a point 
of pride. 

Incidents of violence against 

Dalit women are not few and far 
between. About a month earlier, 
a 13 year old girl died in the same 
region, and in 2018, a girl was 
beheaded in southern India by an 
upper-caste male. In a country 

that prides itself on being a boom-
ing modern society, why are these 
acts of inhumane violence so 
prevalent against Dalit women? 
Why are they so normalized? 

Many people, including those 

living in the Western hemi-
sphere, like to brush away caste 
as something outdated; legally, 
the caste system was outlawed 
in 1950, but this was never effec-
tively enforced. Those with privi-
lege in the Hindu community 
act like it doesn’t exist because 
they benefit from it constantly; 
for families whose entire iden-
tity and sense of pride revolve 
around some arbitrary, ancient 
label, it’s easy for them to forget 
that not everyone has that privi-
lege. While higher castes love to 
tout their status and look down 
at those who are “other,” they 
rarely pause and consider that 
the same system that gives them 
this privilege destroys the lives 
of those who don’t have that sta-
tus. The United Nations Human 
Rights Council, Human Rights 
Watch, and Amnesty Interna-
tional, 
among 
various 
other 

human rights organizations, all 
identify Dalit women as a vulner-

able population for violence and 
mistreatment. Why, then, does 
the majority of the Hindu com-
munity continue to perpetuate 
and uphold the caste system? 

Perhaps it is because they are 

afraid of losing the power that 
they have held for centuries. Per-
haps, like so many of the systemic 
issues we are seeing in the world, 
it’s difficult to come to terms with 
the fact that your privilege should 
not be normalized. 

The Hindu community needs 

to stop using the excuse that the 
caste system is illegal, because 
this gives people a way to brush 
aside these murders as isolated 
incidents. 
Putting 
something 

into law does nothing to uproot 
centuries of discrimination, vio-
lence and hatred that still per-
sists today. Our families walk 
around saying the caste system 
is illegal while still refusing to 
marry our children outside of 
our castes, while looking down 
upon those who aren’t the same 
caste as us, while turning a blind 
eye at the countless men, women 
and children who lose their lives 
every year for something they 
don’t control, something that 

should not even exist in the first 
place. Even now in the 21st cen-
tury, the caste system continues 
to perpetuate harm and pain to 
those who have done nothing 
to deserve it. A person’s right to 
education, 
employment, 
even 

to life itself should not be deter-
mined by an outdated system that 
predetermines a person’s level of 
success at birth. In this day and 
age, the Hindu community must 
move away from this assumptive, 
ancient system of classification 
that essentially degrades a person 
to less of a human. 

I don’t think anyone has a clear 

answer to how to effectively 
get rid of the implications of the 
caste system. As the world has 
observed throughout the past 
few months, changing something 
at the cultural, systemic level 
takes time, energy and frustra-
tion. It takes stepping out of our 
bubbles of ignorance and open-
ing up outlets of expression for 
those who have been barred from 
them in the past. It takes having 
the humility to understand that 
your own privilege means noth-
ing if others do not have the same 
privileges as you.

The myth of the Latino vote

A few years ago when the 

term “Black Girl Magic” became 
popularized by social media, 
as a way to celebrate the suc-
cesses of black women, I imme-
diately caught on and started 
referring to myself as having 
“Black Girl Magic.” I finally felt 
appreciated by the society that 
had rejected me for so long. In 
a world where Black women are 
stereotyped as unprofessional, 
unattractive, loud and angry, 
why shouldn’t we want to be 
considered magical? Growing 
up, I scarcely found people who 
looked like me casted in mov-
ies as a princess, or even a fairy 
alongside Tinkerbell. The idea of 
me being perceived as magical 
felt out of reach, but I wanted to 
embrace the title so badly. When 
I heard actress Taraji P. Henson 
denounce the saying, I got defen-
sive and felt a little discouraged. 
Taraji P. Henson, a phenomenal 
Black actress that I look up to 
and consider to be magical, said 
the term is “dehumanizing” to 
Black women? There is no way! 
How can something that gives 
me so much hope cause so much 
harm?

The more I started to investi-

gate, the more I started to agree 
with her. In a world where Black 
women are disproportionately 
neglected in doctor’s offices, 
coined as angry when express-
ing the tiniest bit of passion, and 
deemed “ratchet” and “ugly,” the 
phrase “Black Girl Magic” only 
hurts us by saying we are able to 
undertake unnecessary amounts 
of pain and rejection, because 
we are built to withstand the 
toughest of challenges. But in 
reality, that is not just.

According to the Endometrio-

sis Foundation of America, Black 
women are three times more 
likely to die and suffer from life-
threatening disabilities due to 
pregnancy complications and 
childbirth than white women. A 
study conducted by the Proceed-
ings of the National Academies 
of Science found that 40 per-
cent of medical students believe 

that Black people have “thicker 
skin,” and are less susceptible 
to pain than white people. In an 
interview with Vogue Magazine, 
Serena Williams described her 
near-death experience after the 
birth of her first daughter. Wil-
liams felt a shortness of breath 
that she was afraid was linked 
to past medical issues. When 
she tried to communicate the 
problem to her doctors, they dis-
missed her pleas for help. The 
problem ended up being serious, 
and she had to have emergency 
surgery in order to save her life. 
Her doctor’s negligence almost 
resulted in her death. If a woman 
of her status and power is being 
overlooked in this type of situ-
ation, just imagine what is hap-
pening to the Black women all 
around you. 

Black women feel pain. A 

brave face is worn as a disguise 
to 
mask 
fragile 
vulnerabil-

ity. Our feelings get hurt, we get 
sick, heartbroken — we are not 
inhuman. In a society that tries 
so hard to dismiss every human 
thing about us, the term “Black 
Girl Magic” is dehumanizing, 
and it serves as a rejection of all 
the suffering that others have 
implemented in our lives. We 
must stop referring to ourselves 
as having Black girl magic so 
when we get in those hospital 
rooms and say we are in pain, 
they believe us and feel a respon-
sibility to keep us Black women 
alive. We must become vulner-
able so that our feelings will 
stop being dismissed, and we are 
given the respect we deserve as 
human beings. 

While Black women have sur-

vived a lot, we are not above the 
pain everyone else feels. Our 
hearts are fragile and must be 
handled with care. Black women 
deserve a life where we are not 
expected to take our own punch-
es as well as everyone else’s — we 
deserve to be loved and nurtured 
as we love and nurture. We are 
capable of so much more than 
what society tries to say we are. 
Black women are remarkable. 
Black women are emotional. 
Black women are breathtaking. 
Black women are vulnerable. 
Black women are human.

On Indigenous People’s Day, Michigan in Color would like to express 

our ongoing solidarity with Native Americans and the Indigenous 
struggle against the forces of settler-colonialism for their legitimate 
claim on this land. As a University situated on the land stewarded by 
the Niswi Ishkodewan Anishinaabeg (The Three Fires People of the 

Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi) and their neighbors the Seneca, Dela-
ware, Shawnee and Wyandot nations, we have a personal responsibility 

to push against the colonial pedagogies of our curriculum.We urge 
readers to actively fight against the erasure of indigenous histories, 

not just today, but everyday. Michigan in Color is committed to uplift-
ing the voices of marginalized communities, and as such would like to 
share a list of demands by the Decolonial Pedagogies Initiative. Below 

is a consolidated list of their demands.

Desensitization through statistics

YOUR WEEKLY

ARIES

Financial ups and downs cause 
headaches this week, Aries, but 
it’s within your control to get 
your money better organized. 
Working on your time 

management may free 
up time to indulge in a 
lucrative side hustle, 
which will help.

AQUARIUS

GEMINI

Expect strange coincidences or 
fleeting corner-of-the-eye 
glimpses of otherworldly beings. 
Your spiritual growth is moving 
quickly, Gemini, and help on this 

topic from a sympa-
thetic and encouraging 
family member is very 
welcome.

SAGITTARIUS

CAPRICORN

SCORPIO

CANCER

Events in your social circle take a 
surprising turn and you may find 
yourself wondering if you really 
know someone at all, Cancer, 
given their odd behavior. Give 

everyone the benefit of 
the doubt. There’s 
method in their 
madness.

TAURUS

Unexpected news from your 
partner puts your relationship in 
the spotlight, but there should be 
cause for joy mixed with the shock. 
A tumultuous week is in the cards, 

Taurus, but there are 
memories to made here 
too.

VIRGO

PICES

LIBRA
LEO

Tensions between your work and 
home life decrease, finally, 
thanks to a boost in your income 
which makes it easier to balance 
your competing priorities. Look 

ahead with confidence, 
Leo – it just might be 
possible to have it all, 
after all.

Read your weekly horoscopes from astrology.tv

You’re changing your mind so 
often this week that you’re 
struggling to keep up with 
yourself. This intellectual 
instability is a good thing though, 

Virgo, in as much as it 

shows that you are 
keeping an open mind. 
Don’t be afraid to 
revisit old opinions.

Someone forgives you out of the 
blue – but do you forgive yourself? 
The energies this week encourage 
you to look ahead and to stop 
fretting about the past, Libra. You 

may have made a 

mistake, but so do we 
all. Be kinder to 
yourself.

Romantic surprises and passionate 
encounters – what’s not to love 
about this energy? It’s set to be a 
very loving week, Scorpio, whether 
you’re in an existing relationship 

or looking for new love. If 

you’re single, a 

friendship may turn 
into something much 
more.

A happy accident or fortunate 
coincidence works in your favor, 
Sagittarius, but you’re reminded 
that you could create more of 
your own luck if you were better 

organized. Work on 

clearing your clutter so 

that you can spend 
more time manifest-
ing your dreams.

Fun is very much a team effort 
this week, so say yes to invitations 
and don’t be afraid to join in. If a 
travel opportunity presents itself, 
Capricorn, you’ll be busy 

weighing up the pros and 

cons – but don’t take so 

long that you miss out 
on an incredible 
chance.

Chaos at work subsides into 
something more doable and 
normal, but there’s still a lot of 
hard work to be done. Fortunately, 
Aquarius, your loved ones are very 

understanding and will 

back your need to spend 
more time on your 
career. Don’t lose your 
focus.

News travels fast, Pisces, but 
double check your facts before 
you spread gossip which may or 
may not be true. There’s an air of 
excitement as you wait for an 
announcement – and it should 

hopefully be good 
news. Changing 
circumstances benefit 
you hugely.

WHISPER

“Dude in park to friend, Taco: 
Blaming Covid on Trump is like 
blaming me for the sun comin’ up”

“Give lifetakes blog a look on 
Wordpress, twitter, Instagram, 
and Facebook!”

“I grew my self worth so much this 
summer I feel like I’ve outgrown 
friends I once thought I needed.”

We live in a country where, 

with even a bare amount of effort 
exerted, access to information 
regarding a million different 
issues is readily obtainable. 
That doesn’t necessitate that 
any of such information is true, 
or that subject matters are cov-
ered with the attention they 
deserve. The information — 
authentic or fake, specific or 
vague — is readily accessible for 
the majority of us. We are used 
to continually having numbers, 
statistics, estimates poured into 
our ears. While it is crucial to 
be aware of current events and 
their impacts, it is purposeless 
if you are not able to understand 
and empathize with what the 
current events mean. And that 
is exactly the problem we are 
facing with each generation, 
each progressively less able 
to comprehend the severity of 
these issues. 

We are becoming an increas-

ingly desensitized society. We 
are unable to put intense situ-
ations into perspective. Part of 

it is simple, human nature. The 
disparity between 10,000 and 
11,000 lives lost is not something 
we are able to process instan-
taneously, especially when we 
are flooded with the news of 
death every day; it floats over 
our heads. Many of us do not 
really feel an elevated sense of 
despair when we hear the num-
ber of malnourished children in 
Yemen could increase from 2.2 
million to 2.4 million by the end 
of this year. What does two mil-
lion mean? The majority of us 
have not been exposed to this 
immense of a number, making 
it unimaginable to visualize its 
scope in global and historical 
situations. Wislawa Szymbor-
ska, a Nobel Peace Prize recipi-
ent, elaborates on the concept 
of counting the dead: “history 
counts its skeletons in round 
numbers. A thousand and one 
remains a thousand, as though 
the one had never existed.”

If we are unable to truly com-

prehend damage, it becomes 
impossible to understand the 
severity of the events we are 
experiencing globally. We get 
accustomed 
to 
listening 
to 

large, hollow numbers and our 

ability to empathize with oth-
ers diminishes. We derogate 
from the actual loss of human 
lives. 

This 
mindset 
is 
actively 

reflected in our society today. 
Whether or not you agree teen-
agers and children should have 
access to violent games is a 
separate conversation. But the 
fact of the matter is that many 
popular games give exposure 
to graphic events like decapi-
tation, headshots, murder and 
rape. These exposures have a 
hand in desensitizing children 
to the weight of violence. If a 
13-year-old spends an hour a 
day working on their headshot 
capabilities in Call of Duty, it is 
inevitably harder for them to be 
moved when a similar situation 
reaches the headlines. 

We need to start looking at 

the numbers — even the very 
small ones — and take a minute 
to stop and digest. Take a min-
ute to think about if the person 
who got shot was someone you 
loved, if the rape victim was a 
member of your family, if the 
person who got run down by a 
car was your best friend, if the 
victim of suicide was someone 

you personally knew. They are 
incredibly uncomfortable situ-
ations to willingly put yourself 
in, but nothing is worth sacri-
ficing what makes you human 
and what gives you the ability 
to empathize. If we make con-
textualizing 
these 
tragedies 

a habit, it can become easier 
to understand the devastation 
behind global events. I don’t 
think I can ever understand 
what 10,000 deaths means. I 
honestly have tried; I sit idle 
and reflect on what that number 
looks like. But I can’t seem to 
wrap my mind around its mag-
nitude. But making an honest 
attempt counts for something, 
paving the way to becoming 
more aware of the impact sta-
tistics have beyond their place 
in a news article. We need to 
focus on what makes us human: 
a sense of shared mortality, 
loss, a unity that goes beyond 
the limits of race, religion or 
nationality. Being bombarded 
by numbers that continue to 
desensitize us is what makes 
calamity seem trivialized, a 
mentality that goes against our 
humanity: a calamity in and of 
itself.

United Statement: Uplifting Diverse Indigenous Ontologies 
We students find it imperative The University of Michigan accom-

modates institutional space for Diverse Indigenous Ontologies to take 
part in weaving our shared sustainable future through Decolonizing 

Pedagogies. Only through creating an ethics of reciprocity between the 
University of Michigan and the World will we be able to truly create an 

inclusive UofM. 

The United Statement and all demands of the Decolonizing Pedago-
gies Initiative (DPI) are made relevant by The University of Michi-

gan’s existing mission statement:

“The mission of the University of Michigan is to serve the people of 

Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicat-
ing, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and 
in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and 

enrich the future.”

Go to https://www.seedsforchange.ca/decolonizingpedagogiesinitiative for 

more on the initiative and access to the full United Statement. 

1. Considering the University of Michigan was founded following the 

establishment of The Fort Meigs Treaty, we assert that the Treaty be rec-
ognized beyond Land Acknowledgement and used as a reputable refer-
ence of Anishinaabek land and cultural rights, operating as a central focus 
for all University affairs. An Institutional Territorial Land Acknowledge-
ment must exist to function as a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
for the Anishinaabek, Decolonial Faculty/Staff, Global Indigenous Facul-
ty/Staff/Students and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Unit Plan Contacts. 

2. A DPI Taskforce be created in evaluating and meeting the continu-

ous needs of Anishinaabek and Global Indigenous students to serve a 
living document to the Board of Regents that reinforce the most recent 
Native American Student Task Force Committee Demands. 

3. In an effort to combat The University of Michigan’s systemic era-

sure, we assert that Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island be represented by 
the name of their respective Nation, Tribe, Band or language family and 
not by terms imposed on them (e.g., “[American] Indian”), unless Indig-
enous stakeholders (e.g. Tribal Elders, Indigenous Community Leaders) 
explicitly request that the The University of Michigan reference them as 
Native American/American Indian, etc. 

4. Indigenous people of East Pacific, North Pacific and South Pacific 

descent be represented by their respective islands of Polynesian, Mela-
nesian, Micronesian and Australasian heritage. Terms such as ‘Pacific 
Islander’ must be respective of their diverse Indigenous ontologies with-
out omitting Indigenous people of New Zealand and Australia. Like the 
term Oceania, it must reflect all of Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia, 
Polynesia and some identifying populations of The Philippines. Indig-
enous communities depend on Michigan’s academic leadership to sustain 
lands, cultures and people far beyond Michigan’s state lines. For diverse 
students of Oceania to truly belong at The University of Michigan, Michi-
gan’s structures and definitions must reflect their ontologies.

5. First Nations of Canada, Indigenous South Americans, Mesoameri-

cans, Afro Caribbeans, Black Natives be regarded with rising respect and 
visibility as Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island. 

6. The University’s implementation of the Michigan Indian Tuition 

Waiver (MITW) be expanded beyond state law to support all First 
Nations Canadian and American Indigenous bands/tribes —- regardless 
of phenotype, enrollment status, federal recognition or blood quantum 
under the requirement that the Anishinaabek community members of 
Canada, North Dakota, Wyoming, Kansa, Montana, Wisconsin, Michi-
gan and Minnesota gain priority in the MITW. The University of Michi-
gan must heed their responsibility to the Treaty of Fort Meigs by further 
encouraging institutional action that serves and works towards Indige-
nous and traditional knowledge systems that are overshadowed, ignored 
or suppressed by present programming developed within their settler-
colonial model. 

7. Make Higher Education accessible to Indigenous individuals impact-

ed by generational traumas/erasure from Indian Child Welfare Act 
(ICWA), Foster care, Adoption, Removal and Boarding Schools (geno-
cide pedagogy). This includes Black Natives (unenrolled and enrolled), 
Displaced Natives, Urban Natives, Indigenous Bands/Tribes predat-
ing American borders, Federally non-recognized tribes and unenrolled 
Native Americans (all of which are not currently (2020) represented at 
The University of Michigan). 

8. Restore Indigenous ecological management into University of Mich-

igan’s Carbon Neutrality initiative. We believe ‘establishing an effec-
tive path toward carbon neutrality for the University’s community and 
beyond’ must include Global Indigenous traditions, sustainable science, 
resource management, land management, food production, traditional 
environmental management, practices and processes included within the 
United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 2030 agenda.

Solidarity Statement:

This document was written and developed by Decolonial Academics 

throughout Turtle Island and The University of Michigan. On behalf of 
Anishinaabek Latinx, Taíno, Kanaka Maoli, Maori, Cook Island, Native 
American, Black Natives, Displaced Natives, Enrolled Natives, Unen-
rolled Natives, Native Americans impacted by erasure, Native Ameri-
cans impacted by climate change, Native Americans impacted by ICWA, 
Native Americans of Foster Care Systems, Native Americans ‘discon-
nected’ by adoption, Native Americans impacted by generational trauma, 
Native Americans impacted by boarding school pedagogy, Native Ameri-
can and global Indigenous students and alumni impacted by genocide and 
climate change ask The University of Michigan to heed our statement and 
begin restoring their Treaty obligation by decolonizing The University of 
Michigan’s Pedagogies. 

All proposals entailed are intended to have elastic quality and benefit all 

Michigan students across all three campuses from the liberation of Indig-
enous epistemologies and pedagogies. All proposals made by students are 
to be verified and developed by Anishinaabek community Elders/leaders 
and Decolonial Scholars throughout the Great Lakes Region and beyond 
with an official Task Force to develop DPI into sustainable action.

The United Statement respectfully acknowledges the abolishment of 

Prop 2/Affirmative Action within The University of Michigan’s three 
respective campuses. However, we ask The University of Michigan 
continue to enhance support for all marginalized students beyond race, 
gender, ethnicity or national origin in student success programming to 
recruit, retain and sustain students impacted by climate change, natural 
disaster, lack of clean water, economic deprivation, settler-colonialism, 
genocide, malnourishment, generational trauma, urbanization, erasure 
and Tribal Sovereignty.

Y

ears, decades, centuries 
from now, students will take 
a constitutional law class 

like the one I teach with professor 
Pamela 
Brandwein. 
They 
may 

learn, as they do now, about slavery, 
eugenics, 
Japanese 
internment 

camps and the Guantanamo Bay 

detention camp. They may also learn 
about how American political history 
is a story of thoughtful, determined 
people repeatedly redeeming its 
promise of liberty, human dignity 
and equality. And they will read 
about the history you choose to make 
in the coming days.

You must vote. There are few 

demands your country makes of you 
as a citizen, like jury duty and voting. 
Without those demands, citizenship 
is meaningless. The development 
of modern democratic states has 
transformed the world. Billions have 

been lifted even in the last 25 years. 

Violence within and between states 
has declined. The problems we face, 
like the pandemic, climate change, 
economic 
uncertainty, 
violations 

of civil rights, debt, unstable global 
alliances and eroding democratic 
norms, are ones we can solve. The 
primary way we solve problems at 
a societal level is through voting. 
Research, by our own professor 

Arthur Lupia and others, shows the 
ability of individual voters acting in 
good faith to make rational choices in 
the aggregate — one of the miracles of 
democracy.

The moral failure of not voting 

is graver than selfishness. It’s 
disrespectful to your fellow citizens 
if you don’t voice your shared right 
to think for yourself and contribute 
to our country — and particularly 
disrespects those who have this 
right denied to them. It dishonors 
the millions of righteous men and 
women, many of your ancestors and 
mine, who have been beaten, raped 
and tortured, who have been given 
farcical literacy tests and chased 
after with dogs and fire houses, who 
suffered through pogroms, book 
burnings, lynchings and wars; heroes 
who died in the mud in Belgium 
and on the beaches of Normandy, 
who marched hundreds of miles 
to reservations and re-education 
programs, who huddled in ships and 
survived inquisitions, who dared to 
sit in the wrong place at the lunch 
counter and on the bus, who were 
figuratively crucified for loving the 
wrong person, who were murdered 
because of the color of their skin or 
the god they prayed to, who were 
shot in the sanctity of their own 

bedroom, who voiced their undying 
belief in the United States even while 
their government shipped them 
away on trains and locked them away 
in desert camps.

The rights many enjoy today — to 

work in just conditions, to a fair trial, 
to speak and assemble, to privacy, to 
our own belongings, to freedom from 
torture, to freedom from arbitrary 
arrest, to think and read what we 
want — are underwritten by the 
bloodshed of braver forebears. Some 
are still denied them. These rights are 
not our assured American destiny. 

Every morning, many of your 

fellow citizens wake up willing to 
die for a belief in these liberties. 
The least you can do if you are able 
is to walk down a few flights of 
stairs or a couple blocks to drop off 
a ballot, or to wait in line and mark 
a piece of paper. Do it knowing 
that many could not, and some still 
cannot. Because all of those people 
who came before you and fought 
believed, as you should, that those 
pieces of paper change the course of 
history. Vote.

Opinion

T

he ruling also declared 
EPGA 
of 
1945 
to 
be 

unconstitutional. 
This 

ruling directly impacts Whitmer’s 
plan to extend the state of emergency 
in Michigan from Sept. 29 until Oct. 
27. Narrowing the scope from state 
legislation to the local university 
community, while this removal of 
authoritative 
guidance 
occurred 

despite a significant increase in case 
numbers, the onus is now on the 
University of Michigan to provide 
clear public health guidance and 
support to all individuals, both on 
and off-campus.

Our state has been relying on 

Whitmer’s extension of the state of 
emergency to handle the COVID-
19 outbreak and to enforce the 
guidelines we need to follow to 
control the spread. It is unclear how 
the state government will be handling 
legislation relating to the pandemic 
moving forward. The effect of 
repealing EPGA and EMA, alongside 
the lack of national precedent for the 
management of a global pandemic, 
will be the unanswered concern of 
how to handle potential spread from 
outlying communities. 

The severity of the pandemic will 

likely not decrease after Oct. 27, and 
with flu season approaching, there 
is still a greater concern for how 
the infection will worsen on our 
campus — especially because the 
University’s lack of proper testing 
and overall response has resulted 
in an increase in case numbers and 
outbreaks across many different 
residence halls. This Michigan 
Supreme Court ruling ultimately 
emphasizes the importance of taking 

personal responsibility during the 
coronavirus pandemic. 

Thus, 
The 
Michigan 
Daily 

Editorial 
Board 
calls 
on 
the 

University to help outline precautions 
necessary to compensate for the lack 
of state legislation that could follow 
the end of the state of emergency on 
Oct. 27. We encourage students to 
continue wearing masks, washing 
their hands and social distancing on 
campus. 

We also call on the University 

community to sign up to participate 
in 
random, 
voluntary 
testing 

through the University, so as to 
enable our public health experts 
and contact tracers to develop a 
comprehensive picture of where 
COVID-19 infections exist and how 
to contain them. Additionally, we 
encourage those on campus to use 
the University’s ResponsiBLUE app, 
which allows students to track their 
symptoms and receive guidance 
for how and when to reduce their 
interactions in certain public areas. 
While students are already required 
to use this app to enter many 
buildings on campus, we believe 
they should use this app even if not 
mandated to, as it can be useful 
for identifying cases before they 
potentially infect more students. 

There have also been consistent 

cleaning measures taken in public 
spaces and residence halls. These 
actions have helped to not only keep 
our campus distanced and safe but 
have worked to give the community 
faith in our university’s response. We 
should continue to have confidence 
in this response after the end of the 
state of emergency.

While 
we 
acknowledge 
the 

necessity of checks and balances, 
we are asking the University 
administration to also shift the 
conversation 
and 
acknowledge 

the barriers students face when 
trying to get tested on campus. For 
example, students have said that the 
University Health Service rejected 
their requests to receive testing, 
despite reporting symptoms or close 
contact with community members 
who had tested positive. Some 
students have also reported that their 
calls to UHS didn’t go through when 
they sought testing and that the 
reported data is inaccurate. Rather 
than leaving students wondering 
what options that leaves them 
with, the University could enlist 
additional individuals to staff 
phone lines for UHS. Another 
potential way for the University 
to eliminate barriers for students 
would be by continuing to work 
with the Washtenaw County 
Health Department to incorporate 
testing 
data 
from 
University 

students at off-campus locations 
into the University’s COVID-19 
dashboard to increase accuracy 
and timeliness of such data. 

This lack of authority on a federal 

and state level has left students 
without much cohesive direction. 
We need to demand support from 
the University to implement safety 
protocols 
and 
procedures 
that 

responsibly parallel local measures 
and take more precautions than the 
contentious state governments.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I 

have found myself asking the 
following question, set to repeat 
like a lagging, skipping record: 

How much time will our leaders 
spend quantifying the obvious before 
they act? I’m exhausted from waiting 
to see it manifest in appropriate 
action. Our leaders seem preoccupied 
with data, as if numbers are gods 
and they are beholden to them. 
National frustration on all sides is 
at an inflection point and radiating 
outward with the abrupt shattering 
of hallucinatory American life. But 
the question remains, rephrased here 
to abandon the hopelessly rhetorical: 
How will we decide to enact good 
citizenship at all levels to meet the 
moment?

We’re seeing the dissolution of 

American childhood ideals of equal 
opportunity and romance and the 
stab of expectations unfulfilled; A 
president who has fallen ill with no 
one sure whether to believe him. 
Many of us have been watching for 
our suspicions to manifest while 
desperately 
hoping 
they 
won’t. 

None of the problems that have 
been exposed are being fixed while 
we wait and therefore the days feel 
doomed to repeat themselves. When 
the University of Michigan’s data on 
COVID-19 signaled the crossing of 
another threshold, I felt the baffling 
commingling of dread and lack of 
surprise. 

One way to move forward could 

be looking to experts who study 
disasters. Scott Gabriel Knowles, a 
disaster historian and professor at 
Drexel University, has been studying 
and historicizing disasters for decades. 
I have been tuning in to his podcast 
COVID-calls, streaming live every 
day at 5 p.m. EST. In the past, Knowles 
has suggested we build memorials for 
the victims of natural disasters and his 
habit of commemorating what many 
of us have grown worryingly numb to 
is a small, measured surprise, as well 
as a tiny piece of validation amid my 
daily doom scrolls.

On his recent COVID-call with 

Michael Yudell, a professor at Drexel 
University who focuses on public 
health, Yudell noted how W.E.B. 
DuBois embarked on a project to 
document public health disparities in 
Black men 124 years ago. Yudell added, 
“Here we are, 124 years later, still 
trying to quantify health disparities 
that we know exist. Yes, the Band-

Aid has been ripped off … but how do 
we pivot to push society to really take 
up these issues in a way that leads to 
change? Because we can measure this 
stuff to death, which in some ways is 
what we’ve been doing.”

Data represents a complex matrix 

of stories documenting either a 
steady accumulation of numbered 
lives or sudden tragedy. Knowles 
has made it his life’s work to not only 
gather data in his academic research 
but to, as he so aptly puts it,“put 
knowledge (and data) to work.” 
Diametrically opposed to this idea is 
the bureaucracy of today’s mortality 
counts, which seem to have been 
borrowed directly from the British 
empire. I cannot help being reminded 
here of how so much American legal 
doctrine is similarly, and sometimes 
quite bizarrely, descended from 
archaic British common law. 

Another 
guest 
on 
Knowles’ 

COVID-calls, Dartmouth University 
Professor Jacqueline Wernimont, 
talked about how the mortality count 
was commercialized in England 
during the bubonic plague years. 
She spoke at length about women 
called 
“searchers,” 
enlisted 
to 

perform the dirty work of counting 
the contaminated corpses filling the 
streets. Wernimont added that not 
only weren’t most people officially 
counted, but church parishioners 
sold the resulting periodicals for 
profit along with listings for the price 
of bread: The mundane mingled 
inappropriately and deceptively with 
flattened, two-dimensional tragedy. 

Wernimont has recently identified 

a blurry historical line between 
COVID-19 dashboards today and 
“mortality bills” in bubonic plague 
times, adding how their numbers can 
“blunt the pain of deaths.” During 
the 
COVID-call 
she 
described 

how the gruesome labors of these 
“searching” women, usually poor, 
recently-widowed London women, 
were erased. The similarities there 
— between the invisible labors of 
medieval “searchers” and today’s 
workers on the front lines — are 
striking.

To further complicate assumptions 

about the efficacy of data science, 
the belief that electronic health 
records and their standards for 
“meaningful use” somehow mitigate 
inconsistencies in the data is wrong. 
In an article recently published 

in the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology 
Sloan 
Management 

Review, the authors write that “data 
standards for the pandemic are not 
codified in EHRs, and data on the 
equipment needed to fight it isn’t in 
them at all.” 

What this means is our official 

sources of data are inadequate and 
inconsistent at best. News companies, 
university groups and even nonprofit 
organizations 
have 
strained 
to 

compensate by attempting to fill 
knowledge gaps. In the Sloan article, 
the authors write that this “leads to 
multiple versions of pandemic truth, 
adding cost and uncertainty,” and 
that it also “builds a false sense of 
confidence … The New York Times 
reports very specific death counts, 
camouflaging the uncertainty and 
severity of the issues, and distracting 
people from addressing the root 
issues.”

When the national death toll of 

our modern plague reached 200,001 
Americans on Sept. 12, 2020, there 
were no bells announcing the 
establishment of the fact. During 
bubonic plague times in England, 
every burial event was marked by 
reverberating acoustics from ringing 
parish bells. But I knew multitudes of 
people somewhere were mourning 
deaths and medical professionals 
had clearly determined COVID-19 
as the cause of each. When I heard 
the numbered news it felt as if an 
abstracted national reality was 
converging with my personal sense 
of isolation. 

But the defining shock of the 

alleged 
collapse 
of 
American 

democracy reached me later in a 
delayed reaction — like the long peal 
of a bell’s toll — when I read an essay 
on Medium that had gone viral. The 
essay is by Indi Samarajiva, who 
survived the Sri Lankan Civil War as 
a member of its majority and declares 
America has been in the process of 
collapsing for some time. He points 
to how in thirty years of bloody civil 
war in Sri Lanka around 18,000 
people died — fewer than the number 
of people who died in the United 
States from COVID-19 in the past 
three months alone. 

From The Daily: On our govenor’s powers
O

n Friday, Oct. 2, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled against Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer, stating that she does not have the authority to 
extend executive orders regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and safety 

protocols she unilaterally put in place. The Michigan Supreme Court based 
their ruling on the Emergency Management Act of 1976 and the Emergency 
Powers of the Governor Act of 1945, declaring that Whitmer had the authority 
to declare a state of emergency once, but did not have the authority to extend 
nor re-declare a state of disaster past April 30 without legislative approval.

I

n the Middle East, the month 
of September was marked by 
the signing of deals for peace 

and diplomatic relations between 
two countries, a very rare occurrence. 
In a part of the world marked by an 
extensive history of bloodshed, two 
agreements brokered by the U.S. 
and President Donald Trump were 
reached, with both the United Arab 
Emirates and Bahrain establishing 
official ties with Israel. 

The deals have made quite a splash 

on the world stage, and have even 
led Trump to receive nominations 
for the Nobel Peace Prize. These 
accords, signed by leaders of the 
three countries at a much-anticipated 
White House event, are sure to shift 
the regional dynamics and strategic 
reality in the Middle East for the 
benefit of all the signatory nations as 
well as the U.S.

Unlike other notable agreements 

over the last 50 years, it appears that 
the accords signed in September 
could lead to full and harmonious 
relationships between Israel, the 
U.A.E. and Bahrain. Past deals 
between Israel and Middle Eastern 
nations, namely Egypt and Jordan, 
established what has mainly been 
“cold peace,” where the states 

primarily 
communicate 
about 

security issues and resource sharing 
but do not fully normalize relations. 

The nature of these ties has almost 

certainly been influenced by the 
history of war between Israel and its 
neighbors to the east and southwest. 
Yet though Bahrain and the U.A.E 
have been hostile to Israel for much 
of its statehood, neither state has 
ever actually gone to war against 
Israel. The warm peace officialized 
through the U.S.-brokered accords 
will allow the nations to develop 
public and private economic ties, 
defense cooperation and coordinated 
research and development in efforts 
to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

Considering these factors, it is 

clear that each of the three nations 
will benefit tremendously from 
full normalization. Reports have 
indicated that other countries in the 
region may be looking to follow in the 
footsteps of Abu Dhabi and Manama 
and establish diplomatic relations 
with the Jewish state. One such state 
which has increasingly been involved 
in rumors of Arab-Israeli cooperation 
is Saudi Arabia. At one point, it 
appeared that the Saudis would be 
the first Gulf state to foster ties with 
Israel, with its neighboring allies 

following suit. Instead, the Saudi 
government curiously stands pat, 
with rumors of an impending Saudi-
Israeli peace agreement continuing 
to surface.

Among the reasons why officials 

in Riyadh may be holding out on 
establishing relations with Israel, 
perhaps the primary factor thus far 
has been the opinion of Saudi Arabia’s 
King Salman bin Abdulaziz. Over the 
years, the king has avidly promoted 
the creation of a Palestinian state 
alongside Israel, and has reiterated 
that a two-state solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict would 
be a precondition for full relations 
with Israel, as outlined in the 2002 
Arab Peace Initiative. Salman has 
remained consistent in this position 
even recently, and all statements 
from him have indicated that Riyadh 
will hold out for the creation of a 
Palestinian state for official relations 
with Israel to get started.

Salman’s vision has appeared at 

times to be quite different from that of 
his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin 
Salman. Last month, The Wall Street 
Journal reported friction within 
the House of Saud about whether to 
follow the U.A.E. and Bahrain’s lead 
and strike an agreement with Israel. 

In his considerations, the crown 

prince appears to place high value 

in a possible relationship and sees 
Jerusalem as a key future ally in Saudi 
Arabia’s longstanding conflict with 
Iran. The Iranian regime considers 

both countries — as well as other 

Sunni Muslim states in the region 
— as bitter enemies and threats to 
its goal of a new Middle East, with 
Tehran as the center of power. 

Both Israel and Saudi Arabia have 

long dealt with Iranian proxies on 
their doorsteps that have overturned 
or destabilized local governments 
and significantly hurt populations in 
the area. Further, both nations are 
recipients of significant military aid 
from the U.S. With their common 
challenges and regional perspectives, 
a 
collaborative 
diplomatic 

relationship could be significantly 

beneficial for both states. To his 

credit, Mohammed has realized that 
if Saudi Arabia wishes to maintain 
and improve its standing in the region, 
it must look to any possible friends for 
support against the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, especially one with such 
substantial economic, technological 
and military prowess.

It is also possible that after 

diplomatic relations between Saudi 

Arabia and Israel are established, the 
prospects for a two-state solution 
could be even greater. Palestinian 
officials may be more inclined to 
seriously come to the negotiating 
table once they realize that their cause 
is no longer a barrier towards growing 
Arab reconciliation with Israel. 

Additionally, 
Israel’s 
leaders 

may feel more secure in reaching 
an arrangement if they feel that 
their Arab allies will assure that 
the 
Palestinians 
honor 
their 

commitments and fully abide by 
the terms of a future peace accord. 
The strife between Israel and the 
Palestinians has its roots in a conflict 
that has spanned over a century. With 
no immediate end in sight, Riyadh 
should not wait for a resolution to 
strengthen its position in an ever-
turbulent region.

With these potential outcomes 

in mind, Salman should become 
the next in what will hopefully 
be a long list of leaders to take 
advantage of the opportunity to 
establish diplomatic relations with 
Israel. With full normalization, 
Saudi Arabia will be able to secure 
the economic and strategic benefits 
that come with having Israel in 
one’s corner, while taking a step 

to promote the Israeli-Palestinian 
peace for which he has advocated 
for years. 

In 
international 
affairs, 
that 

certainly qualifies as a win-win 
situation, and Salman should not be 
afraid to make the move. Though 
normalization with Israel might not 
appear to be popular domestically, 
Saudi citizens will surely benefit 
from a strong, often like-minded 
partner, as well as the influx of 
foreign investment and financial 
opportunities. If such a deal also 
brings Israelis and Palestinians closer 
to a solution, few Saudis will be able to 
argue against it. 

In a region where violence often 

begets more violence, perhaps some 
peace will lead to even more peace. 
As states in and out of the Mideast 
continue to discover the advantages 
of making Israel into a friend, the 
House of Saud should waste no 
time in doing so itself. With threats 
mounting and a crisis developing 
around the globe, ties with the 
Jewish state will only increase 
Riyadh’s well-being and stability at 
home and abroad.

W

ithin 
the 
Big 
Ten 

conference, 
including 

at the University of 

Michigan, women do not have an 
equal opportunity to participate in 
and benefit from college sports this 
fall when compared to men. Because 
of this, there is a compelling case to be 
made that the Big Ten is operating in 
violation of Title IX, which prohibits 
gender discrimination. Women and 
gender non-binary students who play 
fall women’s sports could potentially 
have strong Title IX claims against 
universities within the Big Ten.

In 
making 
the 
unanimous 

decision to reopen football this 
fall, and football alone, the Big Ten 
doesn’t seem to be following the 
general wording of the Title IX of the 
Education Amendments Act of 1972, 
20 U.S.C.§§1681 which states:

“No person in the United States 

shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded 
from participation in, be denied 
the benefits of or be subjected to 
discrimination under any education 
program or activity receiving Federal 
financial assistance.”

Right now, some male athletes 

can practice and play, but no female 
athletes have been given a comparable 
opportunity this fall. Players for the 
University of Iowa Hawkeyes football 
team rejoice in knowing that they will 
return to play Oct. 24, while teams 
like the Minnesota Golden Gophers 
women’s volleyball team fervently 
hope for the chance to do the same. 
There 
is 
uncertainty 
regarding 

the reinstatement and timeline of 
women’s fall sports following the 
NCAA announcement of spring 
championship dates. This has created 
an assumption that these sports will 
be played in spring — but with no clear 
plan from the Big Ten.

Why wasn’t Title IX or equal 

opportunity considered by the Big 
Ten Return to Competition Task 
Force? The very same 14 university 
presidents in the Big Ten who voted 
unanimously to open conference 
football signed the National College 
Athletic 
Association 
Presidential 

Pledge: The Pledge and Commitment 
to Promoting Diversity and Gender 
Equity in Intercollegiate Athletics. 
This is remarkable because only 81.2% 
of Division I university presidents 
signed on to a pledge which largely 
promises to uphold existing civil 
rights laws. Setting law aside, the 
Big Ten presidents should be held 
accountable for failing to uphold this 
agreement. 

An argument could be made that 

women aren’t being excluded from 
equal participation because they 
might get a chance to compete in the 
spring semester. This logic does not 
hold up well to Title IX statute text 
or case precedent. The “scheduling 
of games and practice time” is listed 
in the 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c) as a way of 
measuring equal opportunity. 

The NCAA’s own handbook on 

Title IX compliance cites an example 
eerily similar to the current situation, 
which states that “institutions need 
to look at all sports.” The handbook 
continues with, “... if football is the 
only program brought back early, 
the fact that there is no like program 
will not excuse the school’s decision 
to bring back members of one sex 
and not the other.” Several past cases 
such as Parker v. Franklin County 
and McCormick v. School Dist. of 
Mamaroneck have established that 
scheduling disparities between male 
and female athletic competitions 
do in fact qualify as a denial of equal 
opportunity. 

One of the ways Title IX 

compliance is measured is by whether 
a disparity exists between men and 
women in varsity sports participation 
and making sure that this ratio is 
approximately proportional to the 
gender ratio of the student body at 
large; this was clarified in the case 
Cohen v. Brown. For example, the 
University of Michigan has a precise 
ratio of 50% male to 50% female 
undergraduate students, so athletic 
opportunities should match. 

Adding to the disparity, the 

men participating in football this 
fall receive more benefits than in a 
regular season. The same Title IX 
statute, as listed above, specifically 
lists the provision of medical services 
as a way by which to measure equal 
opportunity 
in 
intercollegiate 

athletics. Football players this fall 
not only will be able to receive daily 
antigen tests to help detect infection 
of COVID-19, but extensive cardiac 
support care in case of a positive test 
— including giving positive players 
easy access to cardiac MRI machines, 
even when none is available in 
the local area. The Big Ten press 
release regarding medical protocols 
amid football’s return did state that 
“eventually all Big Ten sports will 
require testing protocols before they 
can resume competition,” but it is 
unclear when those practices will 
be instituted across the board for 
athletes. 

To fully comply with Title IX, 

one would expect an equivalent 
opportunity for female athletes. This 
has not happened. With statistics like 
these, every single woman or gender-
non-binary varsity athlete could have 
a potential Title IX claim.

A counter argument might be 

that football is a special case and thus 
should be looked at differently under 
Title IX. Football is a large source 
of revenue for universities, and so 
perhaps it is justified to treat this 
sport differently when considering 
COVID-19 reopenings given budget 
woes. However, this argument has 
implications beyond Title IX. The 
NCAA and member universities have 
vigorously defended lawsuits from 
male football and basketball players 
requesting adequate compensation 
for the use of their labor and likenesses 
by citing participation in an amateur 
sport. If the Big Ten defends Title 
IX claims with a “football is special” 
defense, this could undermine the 
avoidance of paying football players in 
other ways. 

The litigation regarding Title IX 

violations and COVID-19 has already 
begun, foreshadowing more to come. 
The seminal case Cohen v. Brown 
was recently reopened due to new 
allegations of Brown’s violation of 
the decades-old settlement due to 
COVID-19 budget cuts. On Sept. 25, 
2020, a class action complaint was 
filed against the University of Iowa 
for providing inequitable access to 
athletic opportunities for women, a 
shortcoming further aggravated by 
eliminating the women’s swimming 
and diving program. 

We 
as 
students, 
alumni, 

community members and sports 
fans deserve answers. In responding 
to a crisis, which values are lost in 
rushed decision-making and why? 
Why did university presidents not 
act in accordance with their pledge 
to 
provide 
equal 
opportunities 

for women when they voted to 
reopen football? At the University of 
Michigan, will women and gender 
non-binary varsity athletes in fall 
sports file a class-action suit like their 
colleagues at the University of Iowa? 
Is the benefit of one partial season 
of football with a high risk of injury 
to players, including possible death, 
worth the consequences?

In the decision to revive fall football, Big 

Ten fails to acknowledge Title IX

LAURA MILLER | COLUMN

I 

shifted my car into neutral 
and drifted off I-80 in western 
Nebraska 
and 
into 
my 

hometown for a weekend visit. As he 
has done to thousands of travelers to 
enter North Platte, Neb., since 1963, a 
stern-faced Buffalo Bill glared down 
at me with a rifle in his hands from a 
50-foot billboard. Behind him stands 
the famous Fort Cody, an imposing 
wooden building with plaster grizzly 
bears and mannequins guarding its 
doors. Inside is the story of the Wild 
West and its most famous celebrity, 
William F. Cody. 

Earning the nickname “Buffalo 

Bill” after killing approximately 
4,000 bison in eight months, the 
hunter became an instrumental tool 
in the U.S. government’s mission to 
starve the area’s Native American 
tribes, who depended on the vast 
herds that once roamed the Great 
Plains. In his later years, he began 
the famous “Wild West Show” 
at his ranch on the outskirts of 
town, garnering worldwide, A-list 
celebrity status. European royalty 
and famous Westerners like Annie 
Oakley came here to dine with the 
world’s most famous man and hunt 
the now critically-endangered North 
American Bison. 

I went to his ranch, now a state 

park, later that night and admired 
the small herd of bison kept fenced 
up for events and tourist appeal. I 
looked out at the open fields behind 
them, scattered with grazing cattle, 
and couldn’t help but feel pity for 
the magnificent animals, lying in 
the mud in front of me in their small 
enclosure. Every North American 
Bison can trace its lineage back to 
the final 300 that escaped extinction 
— the last of 60 million that once 

roamed the Great Plains. Their 

tragic story is often recited as another 
regrettable American mistake of our 
past, but its lessons about extinction, 
and narrow escape from it, are more 
relevant today than ever.

Fifteen 
thousand 
University 

of Michigan students and faculty 
marched through the streets on 
April 22, 1970, in the first celebration 
of a new holiday called Earth Day. 
Following in the footsteps of pioneers 
like Rachel Carson and Jane Goodall, 
the new environmental movement 
immediately had to confront a never-
ending and exponentially growing 

list of long-existing issues. While the 
success of these battles is difficult 
to measure, it’s safe to say that the 
movement has been a general failure. 

Major 
issues 
like 
ocean 

acidification, 
deforestation, 
the 

collapse of biodiversity and over-use 
of resources have not yet been solved 
while newer threats like climate 
change, overfishing and politicization 
of environmental issues have been met 
with less than sufficient resistance. 
The result is the apocalyptic United 
States we now live in, where national 
disasters have forced Americans in 
California or Iowa or the Gulf Coast 
from their homes as climate refugees. 

Since the pandemic began, my 

newsfeed has been filled with an 
increasing 
number 
of 
terrifying 

studies and headlines that show just 
how bad things have truly become. 
Back in June, The New York Times 
released a report stating that over 500 
species will likely go extinct in the next 
20 years, a number of extinctions that 
would naturally occur over 16,000 
years if not for the environmental 
issues impacting Earth. Since the 
1970s alone, over 70% of the world’s 
animal populations have been wiped 
out, leaving more than a million 
species confronting extinction.

These 
levels 
of 
biodiversity 

loss haven’t been seen since a 
meteor wiped out the dinosaurs 
65 million years ago and are a sign 
that humanity’s efforts to grow 
sustainably have failed disastrously. 
The COVID-19 pandemic, which 
is itself the hypothesized result of 
poaching and wildlife trafficking, is 
perhaps the greatest example of what 
complications will continue to arise 
as we delete nature from existence. 

Since March, this disaster has 

killed over 200,000 Americans and 
made the world an increasingly 
dangerous and stressful place to live. 
One, often over-exaggerated, silver-
lining throughout all of this has been 
the worldwide drop in emissions and 
pollution due to national lockdowns. 
It was the first time in nearly a 
century, and the only time since the 
environmental movement began, that 
the world experienced a decrease in 
human activity and greenhouse gas 
emissions. Humanity received a rare 
opportunity to watch nature have a 
brief moment to breathe. 

Now, as the world has been set 

back into motion, these benefits can 
seem like a distant memory, but they 
shouldn’t be treated as flukes of the 
pandemic. The changes needed to 
stop and reverse our current mass 
extinction will require a lot more 
than those COVID-19 forced upon us. 
Banning the sale of gasoline-powered 
cars, drastically altering our diets and 
subsistence farming are some of the 
few things that must be encouraged 
if we want to spare a million species 
from extinction and save millions 
of people who would otherwise be 
killed by the effects of a crumbling 
environment. The evidence is clear 
that we have built a flawed society that 
must be massively overhauled to deal 
with the realities of our world. 

With the largest nations in the 

world 
simultaneously 
deciding 

and legislating on how to recover, 
grow and develop to stimulate their 
economies, the pandemic could be 
the catalyst for this restructuring. 
Pioneering environmentalists must 
regroup, re-strategize and re-learn 
how 
to 
achieve 
environmental 

stability in a post-pandemic world. If 
we learn how to sufficiently influence 
policy, economics and psychology 
to encourage sustainable practices, 
then we might be able to avoid the 
various crises that currently await us. 
With many scientists warning that 
major changes must occur within 
the next 20 years, this may be our 
last chance. With more motivated, 
educated and talented people fighting 
for our environment than ever before, 
I am hopeful and terrified in equal 
measure. 

While Buffalo Bill went to great 

heights to inflict great environmental 
damage, almost every moment of 
our modern-day lives comes at the 
expense of another living thing. 
This lifestyle is one that has copied 
practices like his and emulated them 
on a mass scale, with an environmental 
footprint higher than any imaginable 
a century ago. Environmental ruin is 
not inescapable, but only if society uses 
this current moment of reckoning 
and inflection to confront it. Now, 
with the world at a crossroads, the 
environmental movement has the 
potential to solve these problems once 
and for all.

A

s institutions of higher 
learning begin to do 
the long-overdue work 

of examining structural racism 
within 
their 
communities, 

President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

administration is fighting hard to 
ensure it goes unacknowledged. 
On Sept. 2, Princeton University 
President Christopher Eisgruber 
wrote a statement to the Princeton 
community addressing systemic 
racism and acknowledging that 
“racist assumptions from the 
past also remain embedded in 
structures 
of 
the 
University 

itself.” The statement goes on to 
detail a number of new initiatives 
at Princeton that aim to create 
a more welcoming and diverse 
campus. 

In 
response, 
the 
Trump 

administration 
launched 
an 

investigation 
into 
Princeton’s 

compliance 
with 
the 
Civil 

Rights Act, which “prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of 
race, color or national origin in any 
program or activity that receives 
Federal funds or other Federal 
financial assistance.” In a letter 
to Eisgruber, the Department 
of Education argued that by 
admitting racism inherent to the 
institution, Princeton was also 
admitting that they discriminated 
based on race and were therefore 
in violation of the Civil Rights Act 
and ineligible for federal funding. 

Princeton stood by the original 

statement, as they should have. 
Grappling with a fraught history, 
and attempting some remedy, is 
something that all institutions 
should strive to do. One of the 
examples that President Eisgruber 
cites, 
the 
nine 
departments 

centered 
around 
European 

language and culture departments 
at Princeton versus one centered 
around African studies, is a 
discrepancy that can be found at 
other universities across America.

The reaction by the Department 

of Education to Princeton was 
unique. Plenty of other universities 
have admitted to systemic racism 
at their schools, including flagship 
institutions like the University 
of Michigan and the University 
of Virginia, without the threat 
of legal action by the Trump 
administration. 

So then, why Princeton? Likely, 

the timing of the statement by 
Princeton fits in with Trump’s 
ill-advised strategy of pretending 
that racism no longer exists. It’s 
an odd position to take, given 
that more than three-quarters 
of Americans agree that racism 
and discrimination are “a big 
problem,” as stated in a Monmouth 
University poll released in early 
June. By equating an admission 
of systemic racism to a violation 
of the Civil Rights Act, the Trump 
administration’s official position 
seems to be that the Civil Rights 
Act solved racism, and if it didn’t, 

that’s a personal problem. Most 
Americans don’t seem to agree 
with that anymore. 

There 
were 
plenty 
of 

conservative 
commenters 

who reacted with glee at the 
administration’s 
announcement 

that they were going to investigate 
Princeton. Right-wing pundit Ben 
Shapiro tweeted an article about 
the news, saying “This is absolutely 
spectacular,” but reactions seemed 
less focused on whether this was a 
smart policy move on the part of 
the Department of Education and 
more on mocking people with the 
gall to admit that racism exists. 

Two 
recent 
Princeton 

graduates wrote, in support of 
the Department of Education’s 
investigation, 
that 
“the 
DoE 

had no choice but to act on the 
investigative trolling opportunity 
of a lifetime.” 

To 
insist 
that 
the 

administration’s best use of time 
and resources is to investigate 
Princeton for civil rights violations 
that authors do not believe exist 
solely to “troll” shows flagrant 
disregard for actual civil rights 
violations. The Civil Rights Act 
is not a joke and the Trump 
administration should not use it 
to attack universities attempting 
to pursue racial equity. To applaud 
the degradation of the Civil 
Rights Act in service of a “gotcha” 
moment is disgusting.

It is also hard to see the end 

game with this move. If Princeton 
is found to be in violation of the 
Civil Rights Act due to systemic 
racism, it would follow that the 
Princeton education — that of a 
handful of legislators and Supreme 
Court Justices — is also racist. 
This would strengthen the claim 
that racism is institutionalized 
in America, not weaken it. Of 
course, the Trump administration 
is banking on Princeton bending 
over backward to avoid losing 
their federal funding, which, 
according to The Atlantic writer 
Conor 
Friedersdorf, 
would 

“expos(e) racism claims … as 
hyperbole.” In other words, the 
Trump administration is planning 
on wasting resources to prank 
Princeton. 

A statement by Princeton’s 

president does not make systemic 
racism any more or less real. 
It does not solve the problem 
outlined by more than 300 of 
Princeton’s 
faculty 
members. 

But, it’s an imperfect step in the 
right direction. To expect the 
president’s administration to avoid 
treating these messy moments of 
reckoning as a chance to “troll” 
at the expense of American 
taxpayers feels like something we 
should be able to take for granted, 
but in Trump’s America, racism 
was solved in 1964.

Trolling is not a good use of federal funds

S

tudents returning to campus 
this fall may have noticed 
a new profusion of orange 

traffic barrels around Ann Arbor. 
Though they have nothing to do 
with road maintenance, the barrels 
can be seen along the sides of several 
of the city’s busiest thoroughfares, 
blocking vehicles from entering 
the outermost lanes. Judging by 
the general lack of cyclists and 
pedestrians 
using 
these 
lanes, 

however, it seems that many people 
have not investigated exactly what 
they are for.

The new car-free lanes are part of 

a City of Ann Arbor initiative called 
the Healthy Streets Program, which 
was launched on May 4, 2020, in an 
attempt to promote social distancing 
among people who would otherwise 
have been confined to city sidewalks. 
The program has reconfigured 
traffic on over 30 streets in Ann 
Arbor. Of particular note are the 
eight high-traffic streets (including 
Main, State and Packard streets) 
that have had entire lanes sectioned 
off for pedestrian traffic. 

These 
reconfigured 
lanes 

have been converted into two-
way “streets” for cyclists and 
pedestrians, 
essentially 
as 
an 

extension of existing sidewalks. 
As a frequent runner and biker, I 
have found this new abundance of 
walkable, bikeable roadway to be 
very useful, and although it seems 
to be underutilized now, I believe 
there are plenty of ways in which 
the Ann Arbor community could 
benefit from making better use of 
the Healthy Streets Program.

Not only is it easier to maintain 

proper social distancing while 
walking or running along busy 
streets (which, in Ann Arbor, is 
very difficult to avoid doing), the 
new lanes allow me to run through 
normally 
crowded 
areas 
like 

downtown without being a nuisance 
to other pedestrians — something 
that was hard to do even pre-
pandemic.

I’ve also found Healthy Streets 

to be a vast improvement in terms 
of “bikeability.” Standard bicycle 
lanes are often very narrow and 
leave cyclists with no barrier 
against automobile traffic. The 
lanes reconfigured by Healthy 
Streets, however, are essentially 
mini-streets. With two lanes, there 
is much more space for cyclists to 
maneuver, and the barrels act as a 
deterrent to cars that might stray 
too close. In my experience, this 

has made for much safer and more 
enjoyable biking trips.

As much as I have made use of the 

Healthy Streets Program so far, I 
have been routinely surprised at how 
few other people I encounter using 
the converted lanes. Despite having 
run or biked on a reconfigured 
street several times a week since the 
start of the semester, I can still count 
with my fingers the number of other 
people I’ve passed.

My estimate of how many people 

are using Healthy Streets is based 
on purely anecdotal evidence, and 
understandably, people are traveling 
fewer places right now. Nonetheless, 
I feel that an exhortation to the 
people of Ann Arbor to take 
advantage of this program is in 
order: According to the City of nn 
Arbor website, the program is only 
in effect until Nov. 10, and whether 
or not these changes are permanent 
depends on you. Staff members 
from the city and the Ann Arbor 
Downtown Development Authority 
have been monitoring the Healthy 
Streets since their launch in order to 
determine their effectiveness. One 
of the criteria used to determine 
whether any reconfigurations will 
become permanent is the volume of 
people using the converted lanes.

Even if you don’t have anywhere 

to go right now, I strongly suggest 
that you go for a walk (or bike or 
run) on a Healthy Street. You might 
find that the new road configuration 
improves 
your 
experience 
of 

downtown and other areas, as it 
did mine. If nothing else, you’ll be 
helping to make our city healthier 
and safer by driving a transition to 
car-free, people-focused roadways. 
In fact, Healthy Streets operates 
alongside 
the 
People 
Friendly 

Streets program, a more long-term 
Ann 
Arbor 
initiative 
launched 

in order to redesign roadways 
to 
promote 
carbon 
neutrality, 

economic development and personal 
safety.

The Healthy Streets Program 

was 
created 
to 
address 
an 

immediate problem: the COVID-
19 pandemic. But if we provide the 
program with enough support, it 
will provide benefits much farther 
into the future than the pandemic 
will last and make our community 
improvements 
much 
more 

permanent than just a few orange 
barrels.

Healthy Streets need more feet

N

early seven months after 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
issued her first executive 

order aimed at battling the COVID-
19 pandemic in March, the Michigan 
Supreme Court ruled on Oct. 2 that 
Whitmer “had no authority to issue 
or renew executive orders relating 
to Covid-19 beyond April 30,” 
according to CNN. The 4-3 ruling, 
which Whitmer said in a statement 
she “vehemently disagrees” with, 
effectively strips away all of the 
governor’s powers to unilaterally 
issue executive orders aimed at 
containing COVID-19. The court, 
however, notes that the decision 
“leaves open many avenues for the 
Governor and Legislature to work 
together to address this challenge.”

Since the first cases of COVID-

19 were confirmed in Michigan on 
March 10 — one in Oakland County 
and another in Wayne County — 
Whitmer has worked under a state 
of emergency and issued a wide 
variety of executive orders to curb the 
impacts of the pandemic. However, 
some argued that she had no 
authority to continue issuing orders 
without the consent of the Michigan 
State Legislature after April 30, the 
date her initial emergency declaration 
expired. Until the court struck down 
Whitmer’s emergency powers, the 
governor relied on two laws, one 
from 1945 and the other from 1976, 
to issue executive orders unilaterally. 
Now, under the Michigan Supreme 
Court’s recent decision, Whitmer can 
invoke neither law to extend a state 
of emergency or issue further orders 
without working with the legislature. 

The Michigan Supreme Court’s 

ruling delivers a major blow to the 
emergency powers Whitmer has 
wielded in order to control the 
spread of COVID-19 across the 
state. The governor stated that, 
“Right now, every state and the 
federal government have some form 
of declared emergency. With this 
decision, Michigan will become 
the sole outlier at a time when the 
Upper Peninsula is experiencing 
rates of COVID-19 infection not seen 

in our state since April.” While some 
fear that the decision will lead to an 
uptick in cases across the state as the 
governor loses her authority, others 
— including State Senate Majority 
Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake — 
celebrated the ruling. 

On the whole, Whitmer has 

expertly navigated the unprecedented 
crisis, and her decisive actions deserve 
praise. Although the governor’s 
orders have been met with criticism, 
a poll released in May found that 
nearly 64% of Michiganders approve 
of Whitmer’s handling of the crisis. 
But at the same time, many people 
have expressed great concern about 
the governor’s far-reaching powers 
to single-handedly issue executive 
orders that impact the entire state 
population of 10 million people. While 
Whitmer has acted with the best 
interests of Michiganders in mind, 
it is not prudent by any stretch of the 
imagination to allow one person, 
regardless of the circumstances, 
to hold so much power. Ultimately, 
while the people of Michigan elected 
Whitmer as governor in 2018, she 
heads one of three branches that 
govern our state. Even though we 
continue to find ourselves in the 
middle of a dangerous public health 
crisis, 
Michiganders 
didn’t 
just 

elect Whitmer; they also elected 
representatives to the State House 
of Representatives and State Senate, 
who have been largely excluded 
from exercising their power and 
collaborating with Whitmer on 
executive orders. 

Regardless of the circumstances 

— no matter how dire the emergency 
is — we cannot allow one leader to 
unilaterally make sweeping executive 
orders. It is the responsibility of 
the governor to work with the 
representatives of the state legislature 
to protect the health of our state. 
Meanwhile, it is the responsibility of 
Michigan’s elected representatives to 
put checks and limits on Whitmer’s 
powers as they deem necessary. It 
doesn’t matter what kind of crisis 
our state is confronting, and it 
doesn’t matter whether the people of 

Michigan have elected a Republican, 
Democrat or Independent; ultimately, 
it is dangerous to disproportionately 
allocate any amount of power to a 
single branch of government. 

Throughout 
the 
course 
of 

Whitmer’s free rein, the people 
of Michigan learned firsthand 
the perils of vesting so much 
political power in the office of 
the governor. Although most of 
Whitmer’s actions were justifiable 
and protected Michiganders from 
contracting COVID-19, there were 
undoubtedly a handful that needed 
improvement. 
However, 
with 

Michigan’s legislators being shut 
out of the process, our governor had 
total discretion to issue arbitrary 
executive actions, even if they 
had significant costs; nobody had 
the political means to influence 
her executive orders and strike 
down certain aspects that were 
problematic. For instance, Whitmer 
got flak nationwide for her order 
barring the sale of certain products 
in retail stores like seeds, home 
gardening supplies and paint. As the 
Detroit Free Press noted, this order 
strangely permitted purchases of 
lottery tickets in stores at the same 
time, which the state uses to fund 
certain programs.

Beyond ordering stores to block 

off certain sections that sold goods 
deemed “non-essential,” Whitmer 
kept Michiganders under one of 
the longest-running stay-at-home 
orders in the nation, even amid the 
obvious economic carnage of such 
moves that our state is still reeling 
from today. In Oakland County 
alone, the state’s second-largest 
county, the University of Michigan 
Research Seminar in Quantitative 
Economics found that a quarter of 
small businesses were lost, along 
with nearly 160,000 jobs. Finally, 
even throughout the summer 
months, as Michigan experienced 
low numbers of new cases as well 
as a small test-positivity rate, 
Whitmer prohibited businesses 
like gyms and movie theaters 
from reopening. As a result, 

many business owners who have 
invested their whole lives in these 
industries have teetered on the 
edge of collapse for reasons with 
little support from a public health 
standpoint. Right here in the heart 
of Ann Arbor, according to the 
Daily, the Michigan Theater and 
State Theater recorded financial 
losses of $1.5 million, forced to keep 
their doors closed well into the fall 
as other businesses across the state 
like hair salons opened in June. 
Another theater owner in the state, 
according to the Holland Sentinel, 
said “revenue has been down about 
95 percent since the coronavirus 
pandemic shutdown began in mid-
March.”

These losses are staggering 

and could have been averted if 
Whitmer 
couldn’t 
unilaterally 

keep the economy closed. If the 
Michigan State House and Senate 
had a say, we could have combated 
the pandemic just as successfully 
while also supporting the hard-
working people of Michigan. In the 

midst of this deadly pandemic, it is 
inconceivable why we suddenly 
abandoned 
our 
American 

principles of checks and balances 
and opted to allow one leader 
to navigate this viral storm. In 
Michigan — along with our federal 
government in Washington, D.C. 
— we all know our government is 
based on checks and balances and 
the separation of powers. These 
checks on emergency powers 
don’t become irrelevant in the 
middle of a public health crisis like 
the COVID-19 pandemic, as some 
have argued; on the contrary, 
they are more important in order 
to prevent abuses of power. On 
the international stage, experts 
have argued that the exponential 
spread COVID-19 opens the door 
for world leaders to “tighten their 
grip on power.”

There is no evidence Whitmer 

has abused her powers. She has 
handled the crisis with one goal: 
to protect the state of Michigan. 
However, it is exceedingly evident 

that her steady refusal (until now) 
to work with our legislators has 
cost our state. In the wise words 
of Montesquieu, as the Michigan 
Supreme 
Court 
noted 
in 
its 

decision, “When the legislative 
and executive powers are united in 
the same person...there can be no 
liberty.”

As the pandemic continues 

to rage on, accelerating as the 
weather cools down and we 
approach the end of the calendar 
year, we need to rethink our 
approach to mitigating this crisis 
here in Michigan, and ensure that 
all branches of government have 
a say in the next steps forward. 
I applaud Michigan’s high court 
for taking this action, and I look 
forward to Gov. Whitmer, our 
elected 
state 
representatives 

and other government bodies 
working collectively to protect 
our state.

Whitmer’s powers should be checked, even in the middle of a pandemic

Mural lights up downtown alleyway ‘PEN15’ and an 

all-female puberty

A smiling student stands with a 

backpack slung over her shoulder, 
books and notebooks held in hand, 
no mask in sight. A reminder of 
simpler times. Elsewhere, recent 
graduates throw their hats in 
the air and a father teaches his 
son how to skateboard. A student 
pulls his friend into a party. The 
State Theatre and Bell Tower 
both stand tall, proud monuments 
of Ann Arbor and the University. 
These are some, but not all, of the 
frames in the new mural that has 
come to downtown Ann Arbor. 
Located right behind Potbelly 
Sandwich Shop off of East Liberty 
and State, this 15-foot high work 
of art showcases the University of 
Michigan and Ann Arbor at their 
best. 

The new mural, according 

to a press release published by 
Oxford 
Companies, 
contains, 

“scenes depicting student life 
at the University of Michigan, 
notable landmarks throughout 
Ann Arbor, family activities, and 
collegiate athletics.” Matthew 
Sharum, 46, was the artist 
contracted by Oxford to design 
and paint this mural.

Sharum is a lifelong resident of 

southeast Michigan. He attended 
Eastern 
Michigan 
University 

before 
moving 
to 
southern 

California and apprenticing for 
an artist in California. After five 
years, he moved back to Michigan. 

Creating a mural in Ann Arbor, 
a city so close to his hometown, 
Madison Heights, was special.

“Being a Michigan resident for 

much of my life, it’s a real honor 
to contribute to a locally focused 
installation to Ann Arbor’s world 
class public art scene,” Sharum 
said in Oxford’s press release. In 
an interview with The Michigan 
Daily, Sharum expanded more on 
his connection to Michigan and 
what the goal of the mural was.

“I did go to Eastern. So I 

spent a fair amount of time on 
the weekends in Ann Arbor… 
it is, I think, more southeast 
Michigan that I’m connected to,” 
said Sharum. “Their [Oxford’s] 
theme was called ‘Town and 
Gown.’ They wanted it to be the 
convergence of school life and 
city life since they’re in a big 
college town.”

After hearing all of this, I 

was intrigued and I decided to 
check out the mural with my 
own eyes. I dragged myself out 
of my apartment for the first 
time in what seemed like days, 
rubbing 
the 
screen-induced 

fuzziness from my vision. I found 
it located in the alleyway between 
Potbelly’s and the building that 
once held the now-closed SNAP 
Pizza (rest in peace). 

The first thing I noticed was 

the vibrancy of it all. Shades of 
blue, red, yellow and green burst 
out of the mural. On a gloomy fall 
day, these colors were particularly 
welcoming. I spent plenty of time 
trying to figure out the perfect 

angle that I needed to stand at to 
make the 3D portion of the mural 
stand out. Matthew had told me 
on the phone that he had painted 
some feet somewhere in the alley 
where, if you stood, you got the 
mural in its full 3D effect, but I 
couldn’t find them. 

The experience was also a 

reminder of all that Ann Arbor 
and the University of Michigan 
have to offer. This semester, it’s 
been hard to realize that life 
exists outside of my Canvas page. 
The mural was a nice reminder 
of the color, life, and excitement 
that I’ve come to love here at the 
University.

Melissa Gumenick, Associate 

Director, Business Development 
at Oxford Companies expressed 
Oxford’s 
pleasure 
with 
the 

mural, and stated why they 
commissioned Sharum to create 
it.

“The Oxford family is so 

honored to have the opportunity 

to 
enhance 
the 
downtown 

experience in Ann Arbor with 
Matthew’s work. Part of our 
mission is to provide not just our 
customers, but our community 
with the best experiences in 
and around our buildings and 
neighborhoods,” Gumenick said. 
“We hope everyone takes the 
time to experience this new work 
when they visit the State Street 
District of our hometown.”

For Sharum, murals and public 

art are important to cities and 
what they stand for.

“When you have a lot of public 

art you can just walk around and 
appreciate peoples’ artwork. It’s 
like an outdoor museum in a way,” 
said Sharum. “Public art becomes 
a symbol of a community. It 
reflects the goals and aspirations 
of people who live in that area.”

FILM REVIEW
‘Surge’ is profoundly empowering

Following 
the 
2016 

presidential 
election, 
a 

record number of women ran 
for 
Congressional 
seats 
in 

2018. They were dissatisfied 
with how they were being 
represented in government and 
came to the conclusion that no 
man could ever represent them 
better than they themselves 
could. They looked in the 
mirror and said, “Somebody 
has to do something. Why not 
me?”

“SURGE” 
tells 
the 
story 

of three women running for 
Congress: Jana Lynne Sanchez, 
Liz 
Watson 
and 
Lauren 

Underwood. All three saw their 
government was failing them 
and realized they wouldn’t 
stand for it anymore. First-
time co-director Wendy Sachs 
followed these women through 
Texas, Indiana and Illinois and 
documented 
their 
successes 

and their failures. She and her 
all-women team documented 
their journeys “through the 
female lens” for the world to see 
and be inspired even further.

To use Sachs’s own words, 

“there 
was 
a 
movement 

underway.” 
Women 
were 

standing up and taking charge, 
marching and running. They 
refused to settle for a male-
dominated 
government. 

America should not and cannot 
be a male-dominated force 
when there are so many strong 
and empowered women who 
can make a difference and do 
good.

***

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Sachs said she 
and the creators of “SURGE” 
picked Sanchez, Watson and 
Underwood because they were 
“women 
that 
represented 

different experiences.” Each 
woman came with a different 
story, a different background, 
just as all women in America do. 
No two people have the same 
life story, and she wanted to 
make sure that that message got 
across to the women watching. 
“Diversity is where we thrive. 
When we have a diversity of 
opinion and we bring more 
people’s experiences to the 
table, we’re going to create 
a 
better 
government 
for 

everyone,” Sachs said.

The other aspect of the film 

that Sachs wanted to make 
sure that all viewers, not only 
women, understood was just 
how hard it is for women to run 
for governmental positions. “I 

am in such awe of the women 
who run for office,” she said. 
“Watching Jana and Lauren 
and Liz fight the fight … 
was 
tremendously 
inspiring 

and empowering to me, as 
a filmmaker.” And it’s also 
inspiring for the viewers to 
see the grit and perseverance 
required for these women to 
run for a position of power in 
government. 

The beauty of the film is 

its juxtaposition of realism 
and optimism. The audience 
gets the privilege of an inside 
look into a real-time, real-life 
campaign, seeing the struggles 
that the women go through, 
seeing how hard they work. But 
they also see just how much the 
women care about what they’re 
doing. They’re not just running 
to win — they’re running 
because 
it’s 
right. 
They’re 

running because they can do 
what needs to be done.

Congresswoman 
Lauren 

Underwood (D-I.L.), Illinois 
native, U-M Nursing School 
graduate and the only woman 
in “SURGE” to win her tough 
election, had a hard road 
ahead of her when she decided 
to run for Congress. Her job 
of campaigning and working 
to represent the people of 
Naperville was a feat in itself, 
but she also decided to have 
her vulnerable and important 
political journey documented 
for the entire world to see.

“I was excited to work [on 

“SURGE”] with Wendy and 
Hannah [Rosenzweig] because 
I felt that they really understood 
what 
we 
were 
trying 
to 

accomplish in this community,” 
Congresswoman 
Underwood 

said in an interview with The 
Daily. “What I was embarking 
on was hard, and I felt that 
they would tell the story with 
integrity 
and 
not 
project 

some agenda on what we were 

seeking to accomplish.”

 In “SURGE”, viewers saw 

every moment, good and bad, 
that the candidates had to 
deal 
with. 
Congresswoman 

Underwood even thought that 
she lost on election day. “I had 
gotten this feeling in my body 
that said ‘something’s not right’ 
… I can’t be in this room full of 
people and get this bad news,” 
she said. She did win, of course, 
but seeing that moment when 
she realized that she had won, 
being in that moment with her, 
is indescribable. 

Congresswoman Underwood 

told me there were many 
women that she looked up to, 
ranging from her elementary 
school days of seeing Oprah 
Winfrey as “the most powerful 
[woman] in the world” to 
her early days in Congress, 
looking up to Shirley Chisholm. 
Another woman who inspired 
her from a young age was 
“Senator Carol Moseley Braun, 
the first, and at that time the 
only, Black woman to serve the 
United States Senate.” 

“She looked like me, and I 

knew she was powerful and 
I knew that she represented 
me. I was so inspired and 
proud to have someone like 
her represent me … I knew that 
she carried my voice … I was a 
young girl with these incredible 
role models that I perceived as 
powerful because they actually 
had power and respect and 
validation from others. And 
they struck me as very normal, 
regular women, and I could be 
like them,” Underwood said.

She is just like them. Since 

making history as the youngest 
Black woman to ever serve 
in Congress, Underwood has 
already begun to make sweeping 
changes for the better. Just 
by witnessing her everlasting 
effort in “SURGE” to make a 
difference, I knew she would 
make just as big of an impact 
on the world as the women that 

she looked up to. Hearing what 
she has accomplished since 
“SURGE,” such as working 
with Senator Kamala Harris on 
Black maternal health issues, 
only solidified my belief that 
she will continue to do amazing 
things.

Both 
Sachs 
and 

Congresswoman 
Underwood 

want “SURGE” to make an 
impact on people as citizens 
and voters. The timing of 
the movie couldn’t be more 
relevant with the upcoming 
election, and they acknowledge 
and embrace that.

“We all have to do our part,” 

Congresswoman 
Underwood 

said. “That means voting in this 
election, that means showing up 
and engaging in our neighbors 
and communities to make sure 
that no one feels forgotten, left 
behind or silenced and that 
means when we see something 
that’s not right, that we step up 
and do something about it.”

Sachs had the same message: 

“Do something, anything. See 
yourself as that agent of change 
… get involved, show up, use 
your voice, do something and 
make sure you’re voting.” 

If 
“SURGE” 
reveals 

anything to audiences, it’s that 
women aren’t just relevant in 
politics; they are integral to 
the foundation of America’s 
government. “Women belong 
in all places where decisions 
are being made,” Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg once said, and 
truer words have never been 
spoken.

“The 
question 
that 
we 

asked 
throughout 
the 
film 

was ‘Is this a moment or is it 
a movement?’” Sachs told me, 
as she outlined the timeline of 
women marching, running and 
now winning. And I think we 
both have the same answer. 

It’s a movement.

Puberty 
is, 
at 
its 
most 

base definition, a living hell. 
Between the ages of ten and 
14, most people enter a stage 
of extreme growing pains and 
unexpected 
sweatiness 
that 

haunts our memories for the 
rest of our lives. Remembering 
those years is almost like 
having war flashbacks, with 
every 
mundane 
moment 

holding 
the 
emotional 

intensity of a life-or-death 
situation despite their true 
reality. Embarrassment felt 
like death, and happiness felt 
like a million fireworks going 
off at once.

As I’ve grown into my 

early ’20s and gotten a taste 
of adulthood, the contrast 
between who I was at 13 and 
who I am now deepens with 
every 
day. 
Even 
thinking 

about that period of my life 
makes me cringe a little, but 
at the same time, I feel for the 
girl that I used to be. We’ve 
all gone through the ups and 
downs of growing up, the 
hormones 
and 
friendships 

that turbulently led us into 
our teenage years and beyond. 
It’s become a popular subject 
for comedy series, as shows 
like “Big Mouth” take on the 
hurdles of tweendom with wit 
and a perspective that only 
time can imbue. 

This is a tried and true 

topic to make fun of, notable 
in films such “The Sandlot” 
and 
“Goonies,” 
too. 
It’s 

everywhere, but traditionally 
focuses 
on 
the 
cis 
male 

perspective. In the last year or 
so, new Hulu series “PEN15” 
has taken on the cis female 
experience with flying (and 
hilarious) colors, and I would 
argue that it rings truer than 
many of the other depictions 
of puberty that have graced 
our screens before. 

Writers and stars of the 

series Maya Erskine (‘Plus 
One’) 
and 
Anna 
Konkle 

(‘Rosewood’) developed the 
show based on their own 
pubertal memories of the 
early aughts, and as someone 
who also grew up during that 
time, though a little later, it 
reads as incredibly accurate. 
The thing that makes the 
two-season series so funny, 
however, 
is 
that 
Erskine 

and Konkle play themselves 
15 
years 
younger 
while 

surrounded by a cast of real 
13-year-olds. It may sound 
creepy at first, but “PEN15” 
never takes advantage of that 
age difference. If anything, 
the contrast of seeing actual 
teenagers next to actresses 
in their late ’20s offers both 
a visual element of comedy 
and a nod to the reality that 
we are all watching it as if 
we are going through puberty 
again, thrust into our own 
histories while really living 
out adulthood. 

“PEN15” 
captures 
the 

awkwardness of a pool party 
while every part of your 
body seems to be the wrong 
size and shape, the feeling 
of a first kiss and a terrible 
haircut and the taste of cheap 
cherry lip gloss. Puberty is 
also the process of becoming 
a woman for cisgender girls, 
and the series dives deeper 
into periods and boobs and 
pubescent 
sexuality 
more 

than I was expecting at first. 

Sure, 
the 
initial 
shock 

and 
memory 
of 
my 
own 

tween years was something 
to get over while watching, 
but 
eventually, 
I 
came 

to 
appreciate 
the 
show’s 

transparency. We often get 
a view of what it’s like to be 
a boy, getting in fights and 
wondering if you’re ever going 
to hit six feet tall. But the 
girls have it rough too, waging 
emotional war on each other 
instead of throwing a punch 
or stealing someone’s lunch 
money. 

As someone who went to 

an all-girls, Catholic middle 
school, I feel both lucky and 
retrospectively appalled by 
what 
a 
gendered 
puberty 

experience 
offered 
me. 
It 

was nice to feel a sense of 
community 
and 
relatable 

discomfort with the girls I 
became friends with, as we 
offered each other tampons 
in the hallway and debated 
whose 
skirt 
was 
shorter 

when we got pink slips for 
our hems. The rocky road 
toward 
womanhood 
was 

easier knowing that everyone 
around me must have been 
going 
through 
the 
same 

thing, in between the slams of 
lockers and whispered gossip. 
But at the same time, though 
it may be invisible to most, 
girls can bully even more 
invasively than traditionally 
gendered boys of the same 
age. 

The binary that I was forced 

into by single-sex education 
was positive in a lot of ways, 
but the comradery of middle 
school with only girls faded 
fast once someone turned on 
you. Just as the protagonists 
of “PEN15” deal with being 
called 
“desperate 
sluts” 

and 
finding 
inflammatory 

notes 
slipped 
into 
their 

lockers, I was also bullied by 
my 
classmates 
throughout 

puberty. It never ended with 
a throwdown after school, 
however: Instead, my own 
friends turned on me about 
three times, their muttered 
statements of annoyance and 
cooler-than-thou superiority 
sticking in my head for years. 
At 21, I still think about some 
of the things that girls told me 
in middle school, the result 
of the self-conscious powder 
keg that putting 150 wealthy 
princesses 
in 
the 
same 

hallway creates. 

I don’t blame the girls who 

bullied me for what happened, 
nor do I really think that any 
of us know what we’re doing 
in the long run when we say 
something catty at 13. The 
insecurities of that age are 
deafening, 
and 
sometimes 

it seems like no one will feel 
the same way unless you make 
them feel it. But I am glad 
that as adults, the women 
whose girlhoods felt the same 
way are sharing how equally 
ridiculous and powerful the 
early teen years are with 
laughter and grace. It makes 
remembering middle school 
a lot less painful, and a lot 
more entertaining. Thanks to 
“PEN15,” the taste of cheap 
chapstick doesn’t throw me 
into 
a 
traumatic 
memory 

the way that it used to: On 
the contrary, I feel for the 
younger version of myself, 
because she had no idea what 
the future would bring.

HULU

ARTIST MATTHEW SHARUM BESIDE THE MURAL

SHOWTIME NETWORKS


What 
do 
an 
R&B 
singer-

songwriter, a genius playwright, a 
rock ‘n’ roll legend and a California 
hitmaker all have in common? 
To any practical person, they are 
all insane. But they’ve also come 
together as subjects for the four-
part docuseries “Song Exploder,” 
hosted by Hrishikesh Hirway, 
which emerged from the popular 
podcast of the same name. Each 
episode focuses on one of these 
iconic musical artists and takes 
fans 
on 
a 
televised 
journey, 

revealing how their most beloved 
songs were created.

The guests chosen for the 

series are Alicia Keys, Lin-Manuel 
Miranda, R.E.M. and Ty Dolla 
$ign. At first glance, these artists 
and their creations have little 
in common. Yet, there is one 
underlying commonality in their 
operations: feel first, build later. 

The core of being an artist is 

absolute lunacy. It’s to stumble 
upon something — a feeling — that 
just works, and to try to deliver 
it to an audience in a fathomable 
way. There’s nothing about it that 
makes any rational sense, and 
that is precisely what makes it so 
profound. 

Whether 
you’re 
a 
creative 

yourself or just a music fan, it’s 
difficult not to be moved by how 
much genuine passion this series 
is built with. Besides hosting the 
podcast and show, Hirway is a 
musician and composer, and his 
love for the craft is always evident. 
He asks questions that are strictly 
about the music, gives himself 
as little screen time as possible 
and ends each episode by playing 
the song being examined in its 
entirety. The people who make this 
show aren’t concerned with cheap 

gimmicks. They’re just as big of 
fans as we are, and they’re dying 
to get inside the minds that have 
created such monumental works 
of art.

Nobody 
encapsulates 
that 

honest love for music more than 
Alicia Keys. So it makes sense that 
she was the chosen guest to kick off 
the show. In her episode, she breaks 

down her 2020 song “3 Hour Drive” 
which features younger R&B artist 
Sampha. For Alicia, songwriting 
is a joyful process. She explains 
how adding fewer instruments can 
actually make a song “feel bigger,” 
a remark that captures the stripped 
down beauty of her music. 

She and Sampha begin by 

singing out words to a composition, 
until they finally land on the phrase 
“three-hour drive.” The small line 
strikes a chord with both of them 
for very different reasons. It’s a 
complete instinct, and they chase it 
down until they emerge victorious 
with a full piece.

If Alicia’s songwriting process 

can 
be 
described 
as 
tender 

and honest, then Lin-Manuel 
Miranda’s is completely manic. 
The brilliant rapper-playwright is 
a lovable dork, absolutely obsessed 
with finding just the right feeling. 
In one of the more memorable 
moments of the show, he recounts 
how he thought of the idea for the 
Hamilton standout song “Wait 
For It” while riding the train to a 
friend’s party. While fast-walking 
through the streets of New York, 
he quietly and shakily sings the 
chorus into his phone, hastily 
trying to get it down. When he 
arrives at the party, he leaves after 
half a drink. 

Breaking down the intro track 

to his debut album, Ty Dolla $ign 
talks about how important the “car 
test” is to him. He is driven by the 
need for everything to sound just 
right, and to do so, he’ll go through 
five bass players until he finds one 
he likes. To make a bigger sound on 
his song “LA,” he spent $75,000 of 
money he did not have just to hire 
an orchestra for one part of a single 
song. 

Artists are crazy. 
To make something great, you 

have to be willing to chase down 
a shapeless idea that may not 
make sense to anyone else. And 
you have to be willing to commit 
to it. There’s no right way to do it. 
There aren’t any steps to follow 
that will guarantee you arrive at 
your destination. To many people, 
operating in that gray area is 
terrifying. But to an artist, that 
pursuit is the only thing worth 
doing.

“Song Exploder” celebrates the 

tremendous amount of time, effort 
and human emotion that goes into 
everything an artist does, and how 
insane you have to be to do it well.

Live music in the age of 
COVID-19: an evolution

2020 was supposed to be 

the most revenue-generating 
year the live music industry 
had ever seen. In fact, live 
music revenue is predicted 
to double by 2030, and this 
long-term growth is expected 
to stay consistent despite the 
75% drop in revenue this year 
due to COVID-19. Looking at 
the numbers, investors and 
analysts have an optimistic 
view of live music and firmly 
believe that the industry will 
rebound as soon as people can 
safely gather once again. While 
it’s easy to say that live music is 
simply hitting a slight bump in 
the road from a bird’s eye view, 
this temporary hold on live 
shows is slowly changing the 
live music scene and testing 
what consumers are willing 
to pay for when it comes to 
watching their favorite artists 
perform.

At the start of the pandemic, 

artists 
were 
quick 
to 
get 

creative and utilize the limited 
tools they had to engage with 
their fans. As artists canceled 
shows, many took their talents 
to social media where they’d 
host livestream performances 
from their living rooms. We 

saw big acts like The National 
host weekly livestream shows, 
Miley Cyrus’s Instagram talk-
show “Bright Minded” and we 
even saw smaller artists like 
Jordy Searcy take a similar 
approach through his weekly 
livestream shows as well as his 
surprise “house shows” where 
he would perform for fans 
in the Nashville area at their 
doorsteps. As the pandemic 
dragged on, however, the artist 
community realized that live 
streaming free performances 
was not going to pay the bills, 
and suddenly ads for paid 
livestream “concerts” emerged 
on many artists’ platforms. 

In fact, we can look to some 

of the strategies implemented 
by artists and see how this 
new situation is changing the 
way we think of live music and 
how artists run their brands. 
At the start of the pandemic, 
Erykah Badu took her music 
to her own platform, Badu 
World Market, where she set 
up her own virtual concert 
experience independent of any 
venue or concert series. What’s 
fascinating about Badu World 
Market is that it was set up by 
Badu and her team exclusively 
and 
also 
incorporates 

merchandise and music sales. 
Badu’s website, which enables 
her to keep every aspect of her 

brand centralized and under 
her control, offers a model 
for other artists to follow in 
which they can own more of 
what they make instead of 
dividing their brand among 
various streaming platforms, 
merchandise 
vendors 
and 

concert venues. 

Strict 
limits 
on 
social 

gatherings 
also 
raise 
the 

question of when big artists 
will be able to return to large 
stadiums and concert halls. 
Prior to COVID-19, big names 
in music —Taylor Swift, Drake 
and Harry Styles, to name a 
few — were selling out massive 
stadiums 
and 
arenas, 
but 

whether fans will be able to 
return to those venues in the 
foreseeable 
future 
remains 

uncertain. While these artists 
have had to take a break from 
performing, there may be a 
new opportunity for smaller 
artists to take advantage of 
this lull.

Quinn 
XCII 
jumped 
on 

this opportunity to expand 
his following by performing 
“drive-in” 
concerts 
in 

Cleveland. 
Videos 
on 
his 

Instagram show dozens of cars 
spread out across a parking lot 
with fans singing along from 
the trunks of their cars. While 
watching a show from your car 
is nothing like a true in-person 

concert experience, it’s clear 
that fans will jump at any 
chance to go to an in-person 
show in whatever form that 
might look like. Quinn XCII’s 
drive-in 
shows 
sold 
out 

quickly, and other artists have 
jumped on the bandwagon and 
scheduled outdoor, socially-
distanced concerts like Lauren 
Daigle’s “Autumn Nights,” a 
drive-in concert experience in 
Nashville.

While 
artists 
seem 
to 

be finding their way amid 
the 
chaos, 
concert 
venues 

themselves 
have 
not 
been 

faring 
well. 
In 
fact, 
The 

National Independent Venues 
Association predicts that 90 
percent of their 3,000 members 
will go out of business by 

the end of the month. We’ve 
already seen the harsh effects 
of the virus on the live music 
industry 
as 
major 
music 

venues have closed their doors 
permanently, 
including 
the 

Majestic Theater in Detroit. 

Though artists have some 

flexibility 
and 
creative 

liberty to find new ways to 
generate revenue, the closing 
of live music venues could 
be devastating to the music 
industry in the future. Already, 
artists are competing for spots 
at venues booking all the way 
into 2022, making it difficult 
for up-and-coming artists to 
catch a break and have the 
opportunity to perform live. 
Like everything else we’ve 
seen through this pandemic, 

the music industry is becoming 
increasingly competitive, and 
as artists fight for their time 
on stage, the smaller, less-well-
off acts could get left behind or 
have to work harder to build 
a following and make those 
in-person 
connections 
with 

fans.

Yet at the same time, artists 

have already surprised us with 
their resilience and creativity 
when it comes to engaging 
with audiences, and perhaps 
the challenges that lie ahead 
will be opportunities for them 
to get creative and evolve the 
music industry as we know it 
even further.

Five-year-old TikToker’s 
album is a post-ironic win

Emily Montes is 5 years old, 

TikTok famous and may have 
just dropped one of the most 
important albums of the year.

Not much is known about 

Emily. I heard about her 
through my friend Brad, and 
I have no idea where he heard 
about her. According to Emily 
on her song “Untitled,” she 
“blew up on TikTok.” However, 
take a short look at Emily’s 
TikTok and you will see that 
her videos are more along the 
lines of a kid who took her 
mom’s iPad on a road trip and 
is now filming out the window, 
rather than content that would 
cause her to go viral. Her most 
viewed videos have around 
26,000 views, which is still 
modest for someone claiming 
to have “blown up,” and it is 
impossible to tell whether 
these views came before or 
after her debut album. As 
you’ll 
come 
to 
understand 

throughout 
this 
article, 

though, if you want to ask 
questions, you’re completely 
missing the point.

The self-titled album Emily 

Montes is 14 songs and spans 
five total minutes. Five of 
those songs are also titled 
“Emily Montes.” 

Throughout 
the 
album, 

Emily’s 
high-pitched 
voice 

is heavily auto-tuned to the 
point where it is sometimes 
difficult to listen to, and the 
beats push the typical musical 
boundaries, mixing electronic 
sounds with hard-hitting 808 
drums. What is so strange is 
that, musically, this album is 
right in line with the trap-

hyperpop sound that has been 
festering in the depths of the 
internet and is now coming to 
the surface of popular culture 
through artists like Charli 
XCX and 100 gecs. For a five-
year-old girl to be able to 
hone in on that unique sound 
seems unlikely and, truthfully, 
impossible. However, as I said 
before, the more questions you 
ask, the more you’re missing. 
Who cares if she purposefully 
crafted 
an 
album 
whose 

tone matches this growing 
electropop scene? I hope it was 
an accident. That would be way 
funnier.

Created during the COVID-

19 pandemic, each song is a 
small vignette that explores 
themes 
of 
loneliness, 

existential dread, complete and 
total arrogance and everything 
else that comes with being five 
years old in quarantine. In 
one of her songs titled “Emily 
Montes (Breakup),” she sings 
over a piano, “Laying in my 
bed / Voices in my head / A 
broken heart / I’m missing 
you.” The next song, titled 
“Emily 
Montes 
(Corona 
is 

Crazy)” transports us to a trap 
beat where Emily raps “This 
virus is crazy / It’s the end 
of the world! / Boom, Boom, 
Boom.” As quickly as it starts, 
the song ends and “Frozen” 
begins, in which Emily asks, 
“I’m outside, it’s frozen / But 
where is all the snow?” In just 
three songs that amass to 45 
seconds, 
Emily 
investigates 

mental 
health, 
her 
broken 

heart and climate change (I 
think?). It is these disjunct 
and sometimes contradictory 
messages that make the album 
so impactful. So often during 
this strange time period, I 

have felt as though I couldn’t 
control anything around me, 
and this album feels just like 
that. You never know what 
version of Emily you’ll get 
next. She may be depressed, 
spirited, hopeful or angry. She 
may be completely neutral. She 
may drop a diss at Travis Scott 
and Chance the Rapper for no 
particular reason. She may just 
rap about how much she loves 
Roblox. You have no say. Emily 
runs the show. 

While 
the 
sound 
is 

distinctive and the message 
powerful, my true obsession 
with “Emily Montes” is that 
it really feels like the product 
of all internet culture ever. 
Complete vulnerability layered 
behind nonsensical tangents 
and the absurd fact that this 
was all created by a five-year-
old girl perfectly encapsulates 
the diluted sense of irony 
currently 
defining 
internet 

culture, 
which 
now 
feels 

impossible to decipher between 
authenticity 
and 
complete 

sarcasm. The response to the 
album only serves to highlight 
this point. Her fans on Twitter 
vehemently argue that Emily 
Montes is the album of the year 
and that she has reinvented 
the rap scene. The tweets 
themselves seem genuine, but 
the fact that they are tweeting 
about a five-year-old girl’s five-
minute album in the first place 
creates a clear level of irony 
within them. These people, 
like me, may actually love the 
album. And these people, like 
me, might be totally joking. 
And likely, both are true.

“extremely online” to my friends, 
they usually agree — they too 
love memes and spend hours on 
Twitter.

gets messy. It usually turns into 
some form of me reciting my own 
version of Bane’s quote from “The 
Dark Knight Rises”: “You merely 
adopted the internet; I was born in 
it, molded by it.”

In the world of “South Park,” 

the only cardinal sin is self-
righteousness — the attitude that 
personal beliefs and convictions 
are 
completely 
unassailable. 

Whether it’s religion or race, 
politics or personality, Trey 
Parker and Matt Stone (“The 
Book 
of 
Mormon”) 
always 

manage to blur the lines between 
sacred and immoral, showing 
that both sides of any debate are 
odious.

As 
Donald 
Trump 

skyrocketed 
to 
national 

attention and eventually the 
presidency in 2016, the creators 
of “South Park” were wary 
of being too critical of one 
figurehead. For “South Park,” 
the self-righteousness of Trump 
fanatics is just as bad as the self-
righteousness of liberals. But 
as a cartoon version of Trump 
literally blows torches at a 
scientist with a potential cure for 
the coronavirus, the new “South 
Park” sends a clear message: 
They are done straddling the 
fence, they are done poking fun 
at “both sides,” they are calling 
it for what it is and they are not 
pulling any more punches. 

Satire in the Trump era is 

a difficult endeavor. It’s hard 
to poke fun at both sides when 
the stupidity is so one-sided. 
Despite this, the Season 24 

premiere of “South Park” still 
manages to shed criticism on 
both Trump and his opponents 
with 
limited 
success. 
The 

premiere 
especially 
focuses 

on the “abusive relationship” 
between 
Trump 
supporters, 

Democrat 
politicians 
and 

Trump himself. Before 2020, 
this seemed like a successful 
formula. However, in 2020, be 
it police brutality, the pandemic 
or economic implosion, doom-
scrolling is a fact of life and 
Donald Trump is the cause of 
roughly 90% of it. Responding to 
the changing times, South Park 
has done something it has never 
done before: It has picked a side.

In the first few moments of the 

pandemic special, it is clear that 
things are going pretty poorly 
for the residents of “South Park.” 
The entire town is at each other’s 
throats as businesses close and 
social isolation slowly drains the 
town of its sanity. In this special, 
Donald Trump is (tellingly) 
absent, save for two scenes. 
In the first scene, Stan Marsh 
(voiced by Parker) tries to call 
the President for help in dealing 
with the crises in “South Park.” 
He responds that the chaos is 
his plan. Creating a villain so 
purely silly and evil is definitely 
unorthodox for “South Park,” but 
in this political environment, it’s 
extremely fitting. Considering 
the importance of our current 
events, “South Park” chooses to 
be extremely explicit. 

The “South Park” pandemic 

special is the first episode in 
what might be a new era for the 
long-running animated series. 
Instead of endlessly critiquing 
“both sides,” the show is actually 
standing on a set of principles and 
giving the audience a clear and 
specific message. 2020 is a year 
that has already changed many 
aspects of our society. In light 
of the horrific consequences of 
Trump’s action and inaction, the 
time for criticizing both sides 
equally is over. The new “South 
Park” makes that clear, and does 
not hold back at all.

Why you should revisit 
‘The Birds’ this Halloween

Halloween is a month-long 

celebration that spans decades 
of movie history, from Southern 
Gothic to psychothriller. The 
film beat embraces this history, 
dedicating each week of October 
to a different time period of 
horror. This series celebrates 
every nightmare you had when 
you were ten, every creak in 
the floorboards of an old house, 
every piece of candy stuck to the 
inside of your pillowcase and 
everything that keeps you up 
at night. For this week, we’re 
sticking to the beginnings of 
modern 
horror: 
Hitchcock’s 

reign of the ’60s. 

—Mary Elizabeth Johnson, 

For The Daily

When I was seven or eight, I 

went trick-or-treating dressed 
as a bird. A golden eagle, to be 
exact. My costume had broad 
wings, a tawny, beak-bearing 
hood, a feathered tunic — the 
whole shebang. Many a caw and 
shrill shriek were uttered that 
night as I glided from house to 
house sinking my papier-mâché 
talons into wads of Swedish 
Fish and gummy worms. 

I hadn’t asked to be a bird 

that Halloween. I believe I 
wanted to be a chimera — a 
three-headed 
beast 
from 

Greek myths that combines 
the likenesses of a lion, goat 
and serpent. The year before 
I had been a griffin — another 
chimeric creature smooshing 
together the features of a lion 

and an eagle. My sweet mother, 
not really knowing what a 
griffin or a chimera was but 
armed with Google Images 
and a sewing machine, obliged 
my desires by hand-crafting 
my costumes. I guess chimera 
was a head too far, because that 
year she scissored the leonine 
bits off my griffin costume of 
yesteryear to produce an eagle 
and that was that. 

Thankfully, in addition to 

being a mythology kid, I was 
a bit of a bird nerd, so this 
alternative went off without a 
hitch.

A baker’s dozen years later 

and I think my sweet mother 
may have been onto something, 
as has been made clear to me 
by Hitchcock’s 1963 “Psycho” 
follow-up “The Birds.” Yes, 
another 
Hitchcock 
in 
our 

Halloween 
series, 
but 
this 

time it’s a technicolor terror 
— one of the OG “daylight 
horrors,” a genre that reached 
horrific heights with “Texas 
Chainsaw Massacre” and “The 
Wickerman” in the ’70s, went 
dormant for a few decades 
of drafty, dark houses and 
woebegone woods, only to be 
reinjected into the popular 
consciousness again with last 
year’s “Midsommar.” 

“The Birds” takes place in 

the isolated seaside town of 
Bodega 
Bay, 
California. 
In 

Tippi Hedren’s (“The Ghost in 
the Whale”) debut, Melanie 
Daniels, 
a 
devil-may-care 

socialite with way too much 
time on her hands, arrives in 
Bodega Bay to deliver lovebird 
parrots to her own prospective 

lovebird Mitch Brenner (Rod 
Taylor, “Inglourious Basterds”) 
as an elaborate practical joke. 
In fact, for the first half of this 
movie that’s really all it is — a 
’60s romcom with an inordinate 
fondness for birds.

“The Birds” doesn’t feature 

any murderous dolls or body-
hopping 
aliens 
or 
undead 

shades that just really love to 
hang around Victorian homes 
and imitate the sounds of doors 
closing for some reason. Rather, 
when shit hits the fan — and it 
does — it’s a bunch of birds. Not 
birds from hell or birds made 
giant or birds under the sway 
of some mysterious birdman 
— just a bunch of seagulls and 
sparrows. 

“Jaws” would do something 

similar almost two decades 
later, as after all, the shark in 
“Jaws” is nothing more than a 
shark with a particular palette, 
but at least that shark was a 
shark. The birds are just birds. 

I 
need 
not 
waste 
time 

explaining 
Hitchcock’s 

expertise in crafting a tense, 
thrilling scene. He’s got a 
whole adjective named after 
him that gets thrown around 
at any modern thriller some 
filmbro with a blog thinks 
is neat. But damn it if “The 
Birds” isn’t Hitchcockian. As 
alluded to earlier, the film 
largely takes place in broad 
daylight. The film is not scary 
— it’s hard for old movies to 
be scary; even “The Exorcist,” 
which reportedly induced a 
rash of vomiting when seen in 
theaters back in the ’70s, while 
still excellent, is hardly puke-

worthy by today’s standards. 
So, while “The Birds” isn’t the 
movie to get your scream out 
during on Halloween night, the 
careful use of sound (the pitter 
patter of wings takes on a whole 
new color), score and blocking 
make its tension palpable even 
60 years later.

The 
film 
demonstrates 

that even the oh so mundane 
can be oh so horrific. In a 
special teaser trailer, Alfred 
Hitchcock 
himself 
cheekily 

expounds on the “conspicuous 
part” humanity has played in 
our feathered friends’ “noble 
history”: “Thousands of years 
ago, man was satisfied merely to 
steal an egg from a nest and use 
it for food. Now he has perfected 
this process by imprisoning 
each hen in a cage, and by 
scientifically manipulating the 
lights so that she doesn’t fall 
into the rut of the old 24-hour 
day. Thus, he can induce the 
bird to reach fantastic heights 
of egg production.” 

After 
the 
first 
bird 

attacks, a skeptical armchair 
ornithologist 
explains 
that 

there are over five billion 
birds in the United States, and 
over 100 billion across the five 
continents of the world (not 
sure what happened to the 
other two).

We can all do the math at this 

point. Birds are scary. 

Where does this leave “The 

Birds”? A horror-thriller eco-
fable? Maybe so. The opening 
credits are accompanied by a 
cacophony of bird noises that 
begin to uncannily resemble the 
sound of gunfire and general 
warfare. Does this suggest the 
film is actually an allegory for 
wartime uneasiness? Likewise, 
maybe so. This was only a 
few years after the second 
Red Scare, and the ubiquity 
and utter banality of birds 
marries well with the notion 
of a ubiquitous and undercover 
cadre 
of 
communists. 
The 

gender roles also get a bit wonky 
— it has a robust female cast 
that loses some of its glamor 

as you realize each woman has 
an unhealthy obsession with 
our 
strapping 
Mitch. 
Does 

this make “The Birds” an anti-
feminist screed against the 
independent, counter-cultural 
woman? 
Disappointingly, 

maybe so. An argument can 
be made that the film is self-
reflective, 
but 
Hitchcock 

doesn’t exactly have a sterling 
reputation in this respect.

All 
that 
being 
said, 

Halloween 2020 is going to be 
a whole other kind of scary. 
Trick-or-treating and costume 
parties, with either handmade 
bird 
costumes 
or 
more 

traditional fare, is ill-advised. 
Snuggling at home with a heap 
of candy is the move, and with 
spooky season taking over all 
four seasons this year, the tense 
but toothless old-timey scary 
“The Birds” might be just the 
right way to keep the spirit alive 
on a Halloween that has already 
got the scary in spades.

Live music’s last stand: 
the carillon bells at UM

When we think of live music, 

we often think of dancing 
bodies with all eyes focused on 
the musicians. The experience 
is an immersive one, an event 
that demands attention and 
proximity. While COVID renders 
many incarnations of live music 
dangerous, there’s an unlikely 
source of live music that remains 
standing at the University of 
Michigan and that’s the carillon 
bells.

Carillon bells are a set of 

bronze 
bells 
that 
one 
can 

play through a keyboard and 
pedalboard. There are two sets at 
the University: the Charles Baird 
Carillon in Burton Memorial 
Tower, and the Robert and Ann 
Lurie Carillon on North Campus. 
At first glance, carillons don’t 
seem to be the most accessible 
form of music. Few know how 
to play them; they are rare and 
expensive, sit high above your 
head and are hardly something 
you can dance to. And yet, they’re 
revealing themselves to be one 
of the most accessible forms of 
music. No tickets, no special 
knowledge required — if you 
happen to be walking in their 
vicinity, you are in automatic 
attendance of the show.

“It’s 
a 
really 
powerful 

instrument 
... 
in 
terms 
of 

shaping the whole landscape 

of a place,” first-year Civil and 
Environmental 
Engineering 

PhD student Eva Abalgalhiti 
recently told The Daily. “You play 
something, and everybody has to 
listen to that.” The audience is 
everywhere.

The 
carillon 
world, 

Abalgalhiti explained, is really 
small. Everyone knows everyone 
— she’s met the composers 
of pieces she plays that can 
correct her mistakes and help 
her further interpret the music. 
From the outside looking in, one 
might assume it to be an elitist 
community. Carillons obviously 
aren’t 
available 
everywhere. 

They 
most 
often 
make 
an 

appearance at prestigious and 
expensive 
institutions. 
But, 

Abalgalhiti explained, “that’s not 
necessarily the case. It’s more a 
matter of we need more people 
who play carillon to be excited 
about sharing that.” Of course, 
carillons are not easy to gain 
access to, but once you are part of 
an institution that has a set, it is 
surprisingly easy to get involved. 
Abalgalhiti did so with very little 
musical training beforehand.

Performing for an audience so 

far away, often including people 
busy in transit, seems like an 
odd experience. One doesn’t 
get to feed off the energy of the 
crowd, like many musicians do 
in concert. Instead the artist sits 
alone in their tower. The isolation 
— something not often found in 
music — may seem extreme, but 

Abalgalhiti offered a touching 
story to combat this impression. 
During the recent GEO strike, 
she watched the picket lines 
from above and played a few 
well-known union songs for her 
concert, to hearten the crowd. 

“Everybody on the ground, 

apparently, 
was 
like, 
‘Look 

what’s happening!,’” Abalgalhiti 
said. “I think people take more 
notice now, of what’s going on 
with the carillon ... It can be 
an opportunity to inject your 
personal beliefs, or whatever, 
into 
the 
campus 
scene.” 

Demonstrations like this can 
provide a strange sort of heavenly 
support for campus actions like 
the strike.

Having just arrived at the 

university, Abalgalhiti is still 
getting to know the carillon 
program, but has enjoyed it thus 
far. The community is filled with 
passionate 
individuals. 
They 

are innovative in finding ways 
to drive the craft forward. She 
advises anyone interested in 
carillon or any collaborations to 
come forward and seek out a way 
to get involved. There are lots of 
ways to participate.

“What I think about a lot is 

how can you use carillon to kind 
of project something about what 
you believe, or send out a message 
of sympathy or welcoming or 
care?” Abalgalhiti said.

Satire in the 

Trump era is a 

difficult endeavor. 
It’s hard to poke 

fun at both 

sides when the 
stupidity is so 

one-sided. 


T

he nerves reminded me of the feel-
ing you get before a job interview. 
With a light flutter in my stom-

ach, I swung my backpack over my shoulder 
and walked into the East Quad dining hall. I 
spotted the girls almost immediately, the five 
of them giggling over half-eaten pizza and 
shredded brussels sprouts, their close friend-
ship apparent. Approaching them, I jokingly 
thought to myself, Should I have brought a 
resumé?

It was fall of my freshman year and these 

five girls, all already friends and one of whom 
lived in my hall, had invited me to dinner to 
“get to know them better,” ssbefore we all de-
cided to sign onto a lease for a house on East 
University Avenue the following year.

At the time, this process seemed only nat-

ural — of course, before deciding to live to-
gether, one should make sure anyone joining 
in who isn’t your friend is at least somewhat 
compatible with the group. But it’s difficult 
to escape the uncomfortable social dynam-
ics that occur among college freshmen try-
ing to find their people while living out the 
prophecy listed in so many movies and TV 
shows about young people: The need for a 
big group of friends with whom to get drunk, 
share deep heart-to-hearts, cook dinner and 
have board game nights. Like many fresh-
men, I wanted this kind of relationship, and 
I figured the easiest way to achieve it was 
through shared space — I figured, if we were 
living together, the prophecy would simply 
fulfill itself.

Yet, it was only November, and I had 

barely been on campus long enough to fos-
ter the kind of connections necessary for the 
“Best Girl Group Ever” experience. Enter the 
pseudo-vetting process that made me doubt 
if I was cool enough to warrant living with.

Ultimately, I lived with those girls during 

my sophomore year, and while we shared 
some of those movie-magic moments of tail-

gating on our front porch together or watch-
ing The Bachelor on Monday nights, we also 
shared moments of arguments over politics, 
tension over chore responsibilities and the 
genuine irritation that comes with constant-
ly sharing a space, especially in a high-stress 
environment like college. And whatever 
friendship we had somewhat forced upon 
ourselves wasn’t enough to make those nega-
tive moments worth working through.

It’s not uncommon for people to jump 

into leases with people they don’t know very 
well; it’s part of the nature of the Ann Arbor 
housing market, whose compressed timeline 
basically demands you sign a lease very early 
in the fall semester. What follows is a type of 
forced commitment to people who you may 
drift away from by the time the lease actu-
ally begins. While this may not seem like a 
huge deal in the face of so many other hous-
ing issues, having a home on campus where 
you feel comfortable, supported and safe is 
crucial to happiness as a student and person.

The year after my seven-person East Uni-

versity house, I lived in another big house 
with six girls, only two of whom I was origi-
nally friends with. While my relationship to 
these girls ended up stronger than the oth-
ers, I still faced the same uncertainties as the 
year prior. I was still invited into their space; 
it was still on me to be worth befriending. 
Both years I felt I had to juggle the pressure of 
getting close with my roommates and want-
ing ownership of the spaces that we shared. 
This created an odd contortion: I couldn’t 
be fully autonomous in the space, because 
it wasn’t mine to begin with. Maybe it was 
just a poster in our living room that irritated 
me, or maybe it was the constant pile-up of 
dirty dishes and browning sink water. Maybe 
it was the feeling of being a stranger in my 
own living room, since none of the furniture 
was mine or the guests were never familiar. 
These were things I felt I couldn’t change, or 

even ask to change, because as an “add-on” 
to the house I didn’t want to jeopardize our 
roommate-friendships. There was an unspo-
ken hierarchy and, as a naive college student, 
I blindly followed it. 

A home is supposed to be a place of peace 

and comfort; it’s supposed to allow reprieve 
from the stressful, drama-filled world of 
college. It’s meant to be the place you re-
turn to after a long day of trudging from 
classroom to library to club meetings. It’s 
meant to comfort you after a tense conver-
sation with an ex, or a first date gone wrong. 
It’s meant to be a private place to cry, think, 
sleep and recharge. In pre-coronavirus life, 
there were seldom places on campus where 
you could be alone — I once had a break-
down about a bad economics exam grade in 
a supply closet in the Ugli and tried to take 
a quick nap on the colorful couches in the 
Fishbowl. These moments, while funny in 
hindsight, are not normal — I should have 
been able to process those emotions freely 
and in my own home. I should have had the 
time and space to work through my feelings 
in a healthy, private way.

The need to decompress from the stress 

of life is only one aspect of a positive home 
experience, and the opposite is just as im-
portant — that the home does not cause 
more stress. It’s not just a challenge to live 
with people you might not be close with — 
at this age, cramming a big group of people 
in a small space is almost asking for conflict 
and drama (we’ve all seen enough variations 
of reality TV shows like Big Brother to know 
this). Of course, conflict is a natural aspect 
of adulthood and learning how to deal with 
it in the context of roommates is important 
for self-growth. But chronic or reemerging 
unresolved tension within your own home 
means you have no place to unwind. Anytime 
issues arose between my roommates and me, 
I would either escape to my parents’ house 

for the night (they live in Ann Arbor) or to 
my boyfriend’s apartment. This form of es-
capism never solved the reason for the con-
flict and redefined my house as a place to be 
avoided, a place of stress. It made me reliant 
on other people’s spaces for comfort — again, 
I lacked autonomy.

Now in my senior year, I finally found this 

autonomy. It took two years of both trying to 
fulfill the friendship prophecy and scram-
bling to secure leases to finally settle on a 
two-bedroom apartment with a close friend, 
my own room and ownership even over our 
shared spaces. It took two trial runs to learn 
that the idea of the close girl group that does 
everything together while never having is-
sues is exactly that: just an idea. Friendships 
come naturally; they can’t be doctored just 
through sharing a home. And like many other 
aspects of college, from dating to partying to 
professional development, there is no single 
prophecy that one should aim to fulfill be-
cause rarely will we achieve it. In actuality, 
the beauty of college is tucked between the 
mistakes we make and those who help guide 
us through them, including ourselves.

And yet, I don’t blame myself or any other 

student who feels naive for entering a liv-
ing situation with acquaintances based on 
social or timing reasons. The systems, both 
that of the housing market and that of the 
American college experience, which puts 
immense pressure on students to have 100 
close friends and constant fun, are respon-
sible for the awkward maneuvering we must 
do to both have a place to live and one that 
we enjoy. College is stressful and wonderful 
and full of so many changes, and a safe home 
is the one constant we so desperately need. 
And while it would be nice to raise a glass 
with five other familiar, loyal faces, it’s even 
better to break the prophecy in half, pav-
ing way for your own messy, unpredictable, 
breathless and beautiful path.

Sharing more 
than a space

O

n the last Fri-
day of August, 
Craig 
Te-

schendorf passed the day 
wondering where he and 
his puppy Eleanor would 
go after his eviction from 
the 
Orion 
MainStreet 

apartment complex in 
Ann Arbor. In a touching 
act of unity and protest, 
about 20 members from 
the area showed up to 
successfully postpone the 
eviction of the elderly dis-
abled retiree. Photos from 
the event show a diverse, 
masked community suc-
cessfully coming together 
to protect a vulnerable 
citizen of their city amid a 
pandemic.

 The protest was able to 

keep Craig off the streets 
until the end of Septem-
ber, when staff from the apartment complex 
and Ann Arbor police showed up to carry out 
the eviction. In an email, the Ann Arbor Ten-
ants Union wrote that he is still looking for 
housing for him and Eleanor. Though Craig is 
becoming the face of the anti-eviction move-
ment in the Ann Arbor area, evictions are still 
taking place across the nation no matter the 
coronavirus case count or the perils of wild-
fires, hurricanes and other aggressive weath-
er. While the United States housing crisis did 
not start with the pandemic — in fact, it has 
been a decades-long problem — the circum-
stances of the pandemic have certainly exac-
erbated this growing issue. 

 The economic toll of the COVID-19 pan-

demic has left millions both temporarily and 
permanently unemployed across the U.S. The 
national unemployment rate skyrocketed to 
over 14% in the beginning of summer and is 
currently projected to dip below 8%. Adding 
to the problem, the number of permanent job 
losses is increasing, creating a negative out-
look on the job market as the U.S. continues to 
stagger through the economic consequences 
of the pandemic, left uncontrolled by an ad-
ministration incapable of acknowledging and 
addressing the worst public health crisis in 
over 100 years. Irrespective of the abysmal 
public health policy of the 45th president, the 
Trump administration’s culture of downplay-
ing the severity of the virus to the American 
public and refusal to follow Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention guidelines are 
enough to impose blame for the state of the 
nation.

 All of this economic turmoil has resulted 

in an estimated 30 to 40 million Americans 
facing the threat of eviction, mounting debt, 
late fees and interest due to back rent and the 
legal consequences of unpaid rent, such as a 
wage garnishment if landlords sue to evict a 
tenant. In September, an unprecedented, na-
tionwide eviction moratorium was declared 
by the CDC to protect renters and prevent the 
spread of COVID-19, but the effectiveness of 
this action is unknown as evictions continue 
to take place across the country, even in Ann 
Arbor, and landlords challenge the legality of 
the moratorium itself.

 Needless to say, the housing crisis is not 

exclusive to Ann Arbor, which is already one 
of the most economically segregated cities in 

the nation. Though over half of University of 
Michigan students come from the top 20% 
of American households and have differing 
levels of concern and parental support when 
it comes to paying rent, many students strug-
gle to cover the cost of housing even without 
a pandemic and its crippling effects on the 
economy. While the fact that 78% of under-
graduate credits are now offered virtually 
makes the need for housing in Ann Arbor less 
pressing, the obligations of student renters 
have remained intact for the most part. From 
all over the country and around the world, 
students flocked back to Ann Arbor in August 
to fulfill already-signed leases.

 With the fall semester underway, the issue 

of housing for the academic year may have 
faded in the list of students’ most pressing 
concerns. I spoke to Gayle Rosen, a landlord 
and tenant attorney for Student Legal Servic-
es, to learn more about student housing con-
cerns amid the pandemic. She said that “(SLS) 
received hundreds of calls in the spring when 
U-M decided to move to online learning. Stu-
dents headed home and said they wanted to 
break their lease because they no longer need-
ed to stay in Ann Arbor in order to complete 
their schoolwork, or because they lost their 
jobs and could not afford their apartment. We 
have also heard from students who needed to 
return home to help care for a family member 
as a result of the pandemic.”

 After the University declared its plans for 

a “public-health informed” semester, “SLS re-
ceived a lot of calls from students who wanted 
to terminate their leases for 2020-2021 be-
cause they decided not to come back (to cam-
pus),” Rosen said.

 Rosen acknowledged that for students, the 

problem is that there is not a strong legal basis 
to terminate their leases, even during a pan-
demic. Because leases do not often contain 
provisions that allow for an early termina-
tion due to an emergency, rent is still due and 
leases are still binding for many students, no 
matter how dire the circumstances. 

 Needless to say, the housing crisis is just 

another straw on the camel’s back for many 
students juggling the typical stressors of col-
lege life that have intensified during the pan-
demic. To all the Ann Arbor landlords I spoke 
to over the phone, the public health and eco-
nomic crises are not enough to convince them 
that desperate times call for desperate mea-

sures, such as cutting rent or allowing rent-
ers to terminate their leases under once-in-a-
century circumstances. Amid the crisis, there 
have been heartwarming stories of landlords 
showing great empathy to renters, but these 
few instances are the exception, not the rule.

 According to an employee at Z West Apart-

ments who spoke to me on the condition of 
anonymity, students can break their leases 
after paying six monthly installments. Google 
Reviews from May 2020 claim that McKin-
ley Properties offered a 5% percent rent cut, 
which after its annual rent increase, did not 
seem very meaningful to tenants. In addition, 
I talked to a number of landlords who worked 
to waive subleasing or late fees for a period of 
time. 

 As described to me by many landlords over 

the phone, their policies did not change due 
to the pandemic because their tenants have 
not had trouble paying rent, and did not ex-
press the need for rent concessions — so, there 
seems to be no reason to cut rent. If this is the 
case, the income of landlords, based in legally-
binding leases, should be relatively stable. Yet 
several landlords have applied for financial 
support made possible by the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program. 

Data from the U.S. Small Business Admin-

istration shows many landlords in Ann Arbor, 
in response to the pandemic, received low in-
terest, federally backed loans that may be for-
given under certain circumstances. According 
to a data project from ProPublica, McKinley 
Companies received between $5 and 10 mil-
lion, Cabrio Capital and Cabrio TNM Hold-
ings received between $150,000 and $350,000 
each, Wickfield Properties between $350,000 
and $1 million, Wilson White Company be-
tween $150,000 and $350,000 and Landmark 
Properties, the nation’s top developer of stu-
dent housing that has stakes in Z West, Z 
Place and Foundry Lofts, received between $5 
and 10 million.

 If tenants are not having trouble paying 

rent, as high-rise complexes and landlords 
with houses across Ann Arbor told me over 
the phone, why do these enormous compa-
nies need coronavirus bailout money? Where 
exactly is it going? And who exactly is benefit-
ting?
I

n an email, Lisa Disch, a professor in 
the Department of Political Science 
and Women’s Studies, and member of 

the Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil, wrote of the painful 
truth of the housing crisis 
during COVID-19.

 “The pandemic defi-

nitely helped make many 
more people aware of this 
crisis but it did not cause 
it,” Disch said.

Citing a 2015 study of 

American metros, Disch 
continued.

“Ann Arbor has nev-

er been an inexpensive 
place to live but it is no 
exaggeration to say that 
we are currently facing a 
housing crisis,” she wrote. 
“Not only is Ann Arbor 
the eighth most economi-
cally segregated city in 
the nation — not Michi-
gan but the nation — but 
we are second in the na-
tion for excluding ‘essen-

tial workers’ from living alongside the people 
who depend on them.”

The University’s role in the Ann Arbor 

housing market is worth noting: “Over the last 
15 years, UM enrollment has grown by 8,557 
students, up 22%, while just under 6,000 beds 
have been added between new apartments 
and dorms in the downtown/campus area.” 
Where does the University expect these ad-
ditional nearly 2,500 students to live? What 
does the University expect to happen to the 
cost of housing when students must compete 
with a growing Ann Arbor population for a 
place to live, and they do not guarantee on-
campus housing? 

Disch commented on the recent growth 

of the student population.

 “I do think that the growth of enrollment 

and employment at the U (the problem is 
not just adding more students but adding 
more jobs generally) have contributed to 
the housing crisis but it is important not to 
lose sight of these long-term trends. We’ve 
been coasting along with an outdated vision 
of the city that has accelerated inequities 
and reduced racial and economic diversity,” 
she wrote.

The impacts of redlining and racial dis-

crimination are twisted into the economic 
inequality seen throughout the country and 
become even more apparent during these 
crises. The disparities that make home own-
ership more difficult for Black and Hispanic 
households compared to white people and 
eviction rates that put minorities at a larger 
risk of ending up on the streets are insepa-
rable from health and wealth inequalities 
that are exacerbated by the pandemic. Ac-
cording to the CDC, “long-standing sys-
temic health and social inequities have put 
many people from racial and ethnic minor-
ity groups at increased risk of getting sick 
and dying from COVID-19.” Understanding 
the reciprocal relationships between own-
ing or having a stable place to call home, 
maintaining health and building wealth is 
key to understanding the disproportionate 
impact of the pandemic and the housing cri-
sis on minority communities.

T

he 
seemingly 
everlasting 

build-up to the Fall 2020 se-

mester made me anxious 

about where I would live. My mind raced 

with questions as I was stuck in a state of 

limbo, full of unknowns. The hope that I 

would get to spend my senior year of col-

lege on a pandemic-free campus quickly 

dwindled and instead morphed into wor-

ry. 

Should I give up my lease? Is it safe to 

move back? What seemed to be the safest 

option was not necessarily the most finan-

cially sound. Amid deciding, I, and many 

other students, waited eagerly to see what 

the University of Michigan’s plan would 

be. 

As a former University-employed resi-

dent advisor for the last one and a half 

years, my mind immediately wondered 

what the intended precautions would be 

to ensure safe on-campus housing. My 

previous experiences with University 

Housing made me feel like there would 

be a disaster waiting for Residential Staff 

when they arrived for their training. Sure 

enough, when I checked on my peers 

during the August ResStaff training, they 

were already starting to get concerned. 

It seemed as if Housing had not come up 

with an adequate plan to keep R.A.s and 

residents safe during these unpredictable 

times. Rumors buzzed about facilities be-

ing understaffed, and supervisors did not 

have answers to questions surrounding 

safety precautions. 

This storm leading up the R.A. strike in 

early September was an explosion of ten-

sion that existed even before the pandem-

ic. Upper-level housing, which refers to 

any full-time staff working in the Housing 

department above the level of Hall Direc-

tor, and R.A.s may have always had a hard 

time finding common ground, but this 

time, this tension could cost the health 

and possibly the lives of Housing students 

and staff.

My personal animosity toward upper-

level housing staff began from the moment 

of signing our contract called the Letter 

of Appointment, referred to as the L.O.A. 

Every ResStaff member is tied to this 

contract during their time as R.A.s. Any 

deviation from the included provisions 

results in disciplinary actions consisting 

of anything from a conversation with the 

hall directors — who are the R.A.s’ direct 

supervisors — or termination, depending 

on the severity of the behavior. 

I remember when I first walked into 

the West Quad Residence Hall Multipur-

pose Room, seeing my future fellow staff 

members seated together in a circle. I was 
bright-eyed and eager to start making an 

impact on the incoming class. As we start-

ed reading through our contract, a feeling 

of uneasiness settled into my stomach. I 

felt on edge about signing an agreement 

that I had just gotten without much time 

to think. There is no room for negotia-

tion of the contract — it is an all or noth-

ing deal. And even though we were able to 

bring our concerns to our supervisors, we 

knew we had to agree to the L.O.A. or be 

replaced by someone who would. 

While a lot of the L.O.A. is mundane de-

tailing of hours and responsibilities, one of 

the more gut-wrenching clauses reads:

“I will not participate in discussions 

or activities that in any way disparage my 

colleagues or supervisors or undermine 

their authority with residents. I will show 

public support for all ResStaff decisions 

and University or Housing policies. If I 

disagree with a policy or decision, I will 

discuss it respectfully with my supervi-

sors, but will continue to enforce the poli-

cy unless directed otherwise.” 

As a journalist, it felt against my ethical 

code to agree to this. As a student, I felt as 

if I should be able to take my grievances 

with Housing elsewhere if I feel like I am 

not being heard. No change comes without 

criticism and a little bit of pressure. I am 

someone who likes to use my voice when I 

see something is wrong. To me, this came 

across as an effort to silence staff, keeping 

all issues handled quietly within Housing.

Inevitably, the clause instilled in me an 

immediate fear and distrust of upper-level 

housing. Would I lose my room and board 

just because I disparaged the good name 

of Housing? Why did they want me to hide 

my criticisms? What was I getting myself 

into? This sentiment lingered throughout 

my time as a staff member, and I recently 

learned that I was not alone in feeling this 

way. 

During the pandemic and the strike, 

the aforementioned clause was a particu-
lar point of contention, and worsened the 

fear of retaliation. I spoke to a current R.A., 

who asked to remain anonymous with fear 

of retaliation from the University, over the 

phone about this ongoing battle. In this ar-

ticle, they will be referred to as Sam. 

“Here we are now, with a bunch of le-

gitimate concerns that aren’t being ade-

quately addressed by Housing, and yet our 

contract says we can’t talk to anyone about 

this but Housing,” they said. “We felt very 

trapped by that.”

This conflict grows even more complex 

when we acknowledge that R.A.s exist in 

a gray area, where we are both students 

and staff members of the University. And 

while I felt more like a student than a Uni-

versity employee, as soon as I left the con-

fines of my room, I had to be there for my 

residents. In everyday life, there weren’t 

distinct lines drawn between my two roles. 

This ambiguity has proven to be an-

other point of contention worsened by the 

pandemic. As a part of the strike agree-

ment, R.A.s were given priority for CO-

VID-19 testing; however, there was some 

confusion as to the logistics of this because 

of R.A.s’ unique standing. Sam described 

this tension and the obstacles it created.

“There’s a question on there that says: 

‘What is your primary role in the Univer-

sity? Student, staff, faculty,’ and most of us 

put: ‘student,’” they explained. “How are 

(upper-level Housing) going to recognize 

that we are supposed to be getting prior-

ity as ResStaff when, primarily, we’re stu-

dents here?”

This hybrid position has also caused is-

sues in the past, as we struggled to put our 

academics, mental health and well-being 

first, which sometimes interfered with my 

relationships with my supervisors. I got 

a taste of this conflict before I officially 

started my position as an R.A. 

Before starting the role, all R.A.s must 

take and pass a class called ALA 421 

where we learn to have open discussions 

about identity and analyze how our biases 

influence our interactions with others. 

Prospective R.A.s sign up for a section of 

ALA 421 at the beginning of a winter se-

mester, after they’ve registered for aca-

demic classes. Around the same time I 

was meant to choose my ALA section, I 

was cast in MUSKET’s production of “In 

the Heights.” I was struggling to find an 

ALA class that fit into both my class and 

rehearsal schedule. 

The Housing administrator suggested 

that I choose between my love of perform-

ing and the R.A. job. She explained that 

the job meant I needed to make substan-

tial sacrifices, refusing to acknowledge my 

role as a student who needs to engage in 

extracurriculars and take time to do what 

I love. The administrator told me that she 

gave up dancing for her own career. But 

being an R.A. is not a career; it is, rather, a 

role with some benefits. In fact, many stu-

dents need to have a job on top of ResStaff, 

as they are not getting a salary as an R.A.

THE R.A. STRIKE WAS A 
LONG TIME COMING

ISABELLE HASSLUND,
STATEMENT DEPUTY EDITOR

R

ich students don’t like to talk 

about money. It can be embar-

rassing to express the amount of 

money in your bank account, especially when 

it’s money your parents wire to you. And it’s 

easy to avoid conversation about something 

you don’t think of much. 

But as a lower-income student, I think 

about money during almost all of my daily ac-

tions. When I wake up in the morning, I eat 

one egg instead of two to save on groceries. 

I rummage through Goodwill, searching for 

knockoffs of the fashions I see on Instagram, 

a practice I have perfected since middle 

school. My friends ask me if I want to go out 

to eat and I triple check my funds, indulging 

in some quick budgeting to see if I can afford 

dinner at a restaurant. 

I’m tired of not talking about money to 

make my wealthier friends more comfort-

able. I would be lying if I said I didn’t feel 

resentment towards them, as they tiptoe 

around the topic due to a lack of urgency. I’ve 

had a job for the last nine years of my life — 

since I was 12 years old — and I can’t fathom 

how some of them still don’t have jobs now. I 

need to work to pay my rent and quite hon-

estly, it makes me angry that they don’t have 

to as well. 

Why does no one else talk about this?

I’m starting to realize that it’s because 

most of the people at this university come 

from financially affluent households. And for 

the most part, rich people don’t like to talk 

about how rich they are. 

Worrying about how to pay my rent has 

been an issue since I moved out of my par-

ents’ house in 2017
. My parents no longer sub-

sidized my living costs, and housing in Ann 

Arbor is notoriously expensive. As a full-time 

yet financially independent college student, I 

often face difficulty in figuring out how to af-

ford it. Without friends around me who deal 

with the same obstacles, I often feel like I’m 

alone in my struggles. I’ve been feeling it a lot 

recently after early-voting “yes” on Proposal 

C , which is on the November 2020 Ballot. 

This proposal is asking voters to approve 

a new $1 million tax to fund construction, 

maintenance and acquisition of affordable 

housing units for low-income individuals.

When talking about this proposal with my 

rich friends, I can tell they don’t quite realize 

just how dire the approval of this proposal is 

for low-income individuals like myself. When 

I asked my friend and fellow low-income stu-

dent Amaya Farrell, a junior in the School of 

Kinesiology, if she was familiar with the pro-

posal she said, “My whole life is my familiar-

ity with the proposal.”

Farrell is registered to vote in Wyandotte 

County, which subsequently means she can’t 

vote ‘yes’ on this Washtenaw County approval. 
However, she said that if she could she “would 

vote yes because of the segregation that in-

come creates in Washtenaw County, specifi-

cally in the Ann Arbor area. Having affordable 

and equitable housing to individuals that can 

otherwise not afford their rent is crucial to di-

versity, equity and inclusion efforts made by 

the city.”

Talking about our shared low-income fa-

milial upbringings is what has bonded me 

with Amaya since I met her in the summer of 

2020. As with most of my low-income friends, 

lamenting about our frustrations with money 

is what has brought us closer together. 

Farrell was raised by her grandparents be-

cause her mother was in the military and her 

father was out of the picture. “I try not to ask 

(my grandparents) for anything now because 

I feel like I took a huge burden off of them by 

moving out,” Farrell said. 

This is not the first time Farrell has felt a 

sense of economic instability — it’s a feeling 

she’s experienced since she was young.

“We were living paycheck to paycheck,” 

she explained about her upbringing. “We were 

evicted once. There were just a lot of hard-

ships.”

I felt a sense of myself when listening to 

her words. I rarely meet people at the Uni-

versity of Michigan with a similar familial 

experience as my own, and it was comfort-

ing to know that I wasn’t entirely alone. Re-

lying on my low-income friends for support 

in the many challenges we face regarding the 

economic disadvantage between us and our 

high-income peers has been incredibly help-

ful. And though there are a significant num-

ber of studies regarding this topic, there is 

not a lot of action being taken to prevent this, 

despite our knowledge that this is a problem.

The facets of this reality far surpass solely 

the economic implications. Hours other stu-

dents may spend studying are the hours I 

spend working tirelessly to pay my rent, yet 

I still beat myself up when I don’t perform 

as well as my wealthier peers in school. This 

was an issue I knew I’d face going into my 

freshman year of college, yet there were few 

resources to help me prepare for what would 

become a major stressor in my college life. 

To afford the University of Michigan I 

applied for over 30 different scholarships. I 

was granted 20 of them, including the Michi-

gan Competitive Grant. I reapply to some of 

these scholarships each year and some ex-

tend through all four years of schooling. It 

is through these scholarships that I was able 

to afford my spot in Bursley Residence Hall 

my freshman year. For sophomore year, I ap-

plied to live in the Inter-Cooperative Council 

(ICC) because it was the cheapest housing 

option I was aware of at the time. It certainly 

wasn’t my first housing choice. 

I had a few friends offer for me to live at 

their house, but most of the prices they were 

mentioning were $850 or more a month, not 

including utilities, in the Kerrytown area of 

Ann Arbor. It agitated me that they could 

mention rent so casually. It was almost as 

if they didn’t have to think twice about it — 

probably because they didn’t. 

There was absolutely no way I could af-

ford the price of rent they were offering me, 

so I settled for the slightly-messy, overly 

populated cooperative house on South Cam-

pus. I loved living there, but I felt a sense of 

shame when I’d bring my upper-class friends 

over because my house wasn’t as nice as their 

high-rise apartments. 

I distinctly remember one of them com-

menting on how dirty my house was com-

pared to theirs. We were walking to my bed-

room when they passed my kitchen, rife with 

unwashed dishes and leftover food on the 

counters. “Wow, I can’t believe you live like 

this,” they had said. I couldn’t help but think: 

Well, if I could afford to live in a cleaner envi-

ronment, I would. I hated this feeling of em-

barrassment, but it’s something I have grown 

all too accustomed to as a lower-income 

student. Farrell explained experiencing the 

same feeling here on campus. 

“It wasn’t until my second semester fresh-

man year until I started to really see it (the 

income disparity on campus),” Farrell said. “I 

was surrounded by people who could afford 

so many things on the drop of a hat.” 

This year, with the thoughtful maneu-

vering of my friends, I am paying incredibly 

cheap rent in a house in Kerrytown. Yet, I 

still have to work at least 15 hours a week to 

pay my rent, which is minor compared to 

the three jobs I worked my sophomore year. 

Then, there were weeks when I was clock-

ing in 40 hours between jobs in order to af-

ford rent as well as groceries, phone bills and 

school supplies. Now, I babysit two kids for 

$20 an hour, but the frustration toward my 

peers who don’t work at all still persists. Ev-

ery time I pay my rent for the month, I feel 

like I should get some type of award, or at 

least a congratulations.

I don’t think I’ve ever not thought twice 

about any purchase I’ve made. Nor do I think 

I ever will. And as difficult as it is, I do take an 

immense amount of pride in the fact that I am 

entirely independent of my parents, much like 

Farrell and other low-income students. This is 

a huge feat, one that I will never let anyone or 

myself diminish. It’s a significant obstacle and 

it’s not something we get praised for enough. 

So, if you’re like me and the struggle to pay 

your rent is consistent, then I offer you this: 

Congratulations. You did it. Affordable hous-

ing is a fight that I and many other low-income 

people have been grappling with our entire 

lives. I feel a sense of hope with proposals like 

Proposal C surfacing on our ballots: hope for a 

future when paying my rent isn’t a tireless bat-

tle, a future when a call from my landlord isn’t 

something to fear and a future when all low-

income people do not feel the overwhelming 

burden of finding a safe, supported home.

CONGRATULATIONS: YOU 
PAID YOUR RENT!

On May 30, 2019, the former 

Fab Five team member, NBA All-
Star, two-time NBA champion and 
veteran NBA assistant teared up 
in front of reporters, family and 
friends as he was announced as the 
17th head coach of the Michigan 
men’s basketball team.

His raw emotion revealed the 

magnitude of the situation. Juwan 
Howard joined a small group of 
Black coaches in college basketball, 
becoming one of 14 Black head 
coaches in basketball’s six major 
conferences, as of 2019, and the only 
Black head coach in the Big Ten. 

The lack of Black representation 

in leadership roles in college 
basketball is especially striking in a 
sport where the majority of players 
are Black — 53.6% of all men’s DI 
players. 

“I am the only Black head coach 

in the Big Ten, which I’m very 
proud of,” Howard told The Daily. 
“I don’t understand why there isn’t 
more but … I’m just gonna try and 
do the best job I possibly can for the 
University of Michigan to help spear 
our student-athletes to become 
successful within basketball, but 
more importantly successful in life.”

It was his desire to do more than 

just win but also to make an impact 
on his players and the community 
that appealed to athletic director 
Warde Manuel — one of 12 Black 
athletic directors in the Power 5 
Conferences. 

“I just thought he was a genuine 

person,” Manuel said on the ‘In 
the Trenches’ podcast in 2019. 
“Just a down-to-earth, very smart 
(person). (He) had really educated 
himself about the college game. He 
knew about me. … What struck me 
was how genuine and how humble 
he was as a person. He didn’t 
walk in wearing either one of his 
championship rings.”

Critics hinged on Howard’s 

lack of experience as a head coach, 
but that did not matter to Manuel. 
He just wanted the most capable 
candidate and the person who 

wanted the job the most. 

“If I’m going to take a risk with 

somebody,” Warde said during 
Howard’s 
introductory 
press 

conference last year, “I’m going to 
take that risk with Juwan Howard.”

Manuel’s confidence in Howard 

gave him the comfort to go ahead 
and do his job to the greatest ability 
he could. 

Looking back after the first year 

under Howard’s reign, the “gamble” 
paid off as the Wolverines finished 
with a 19-12 winning record and a 
top-15 recruiting class. 

However, there was another 

explanation for the controversy over 
Howard’s hire bubbling beneath the 
surface.

“(There’s) this perception out 

here when you are a Black coach 
(that) you’re not as qualified as 
some of the other coaches who are 
from a different race,” Howard said. 
“I think that’s so sad that folks have 
that narrow-minded and (are) so 
ignorant, in a way.”

The lack of Black leaders in sports 

— like basketball, where a majority 
of the actual athletes are Black — 
proves that discrimination still 
plays a huge part in hiring decisions. 

In an idealized world, that 

representation 
among 
players 

would translate to coaching staffs. 
Players, logic should dictate, have 
the requisite eye and experience 
to truly understand the game. 
However, as is well-documented, 
that is not the case. 

In the NFL, for example, a 

majority of players are Black, but in 
the past three years, only two of 19 
open head coaching positions have 
been filled by Black coaches. Many 
of the new hires were first time head 
coaches, jumping straight from 
coordinator roles or other assistant 
roles or even making their first NFL 
appearances coming straight from 
the college-level. 

Candidates hired with a lack of 

experience is odd considering the 
wealth of potential Black candidates 
with plenty of experience. Consider 
Kansas 
City 
Chiefs 
offensive 

coordinator Eric Bieniemy — who 
has over 20 years of experience 
in the NFL as a player and a coach 
— coming off one of the greatest 
offensive seasons in NFL history 
and a Super Bowl win. Bieniemy, 
like many others, was overlooked. 
It’s hard to say if race is a main 
reason in these decisions, but it’s 
hard to deny that it plays a role. 

Returning to the hiring of Juwan 

Howard, it becomes more complex 
considering he was pitched as a 
candidate with a lack of experience 
and received a lot more criticism 
than some of those white NFL head 
coaches. 

“Why not me?” Howard said. 

“Why, how (am) I not considered 
to be qualified for a position like 
this? Especially someone who (has) 
loads of experience as a player, 
played the game of basketball since 
he was six years old, played on the 
professional level for 19 years, and 
also coached on the NBA level for 
six years. … I have also played here 
at the University of Michigan and 
played three years and been very 
successful all three years, been to 
the championship game two years 
in a row, been to the Final Four two 
years in a row. I am very qualified.”

Someone with the resume of 

Howard’s should be on the top of 
the list when it comes to a head 
coaching role. He is someone who 
has played with and been around 
some basketball’s greatest minds 
and players: LeBron James, Pat 
Riley, Dwyane Wade, Steve Nash, 
Dirk Nowitzki, Jeff Van Gundy, 
Tracy McGrady and Doc Rivers. 

Despite 
all 
Howard 
has 

accomplished, doubt still circled 
around his hire and still does, 
even in the face of the success he 
accomplished last year. 

“As a Black skin, some folks think 

that you’re not qualified enough,” 
Howard said. “I think that’s the 
ignorance that we have to ignore 
and continue to keep driving and 
doing whatever to be the best 
person of ourselves no matter what 
people may say or think.”

These opinion-driven stigmas 

about Black leaders serve as a brutal 
reminder of how much more work 
needs to be done for the fight against 
racial injustice. And as protests and 
marches over the past few months 
have shown, that change is being 
fought for right now.

Howard 
understands 
the 

gravity of this moment and will 
continue to support his players and 
the messaging that he believes in.

“Listening in has been great,” 

Howard said. “To know that 
where we are as a country, we have 
a lot of work to do, but knowing 
the fact that our future is in great 
hands 
with 
student-athletes 

that are fighting to help promote 
change. There are great ideas that 

are being said out there that I truly 
support.”

That ability to relate to the 

struggles some of his players face 
in this country is what makes it 
so vital to have more diversity in 
leadership roles. 

Howard described a situation 

where a player of his heard some 
deeply upsetting comments. While 
he wouldn’t share specifics out of 
respect for his player’s “respect 
and privacy,” it was a situation 
where many head coaches could 
have felt overwhelmed.

Not Howard.
Howard and other Black head 

coaches are able to fathom some 
of that adversity because they have 
personally experienced it. Not 
to mention more diverse leaders 
also bring fresh perspectives and 
different viewpoints. 

“It’s important for me,” Howard 

said, “that knowing that I am a 
public, national figure, that when 
people hear me speak, especially 
the young ones who can identify 
and look just like me, to be inspired 
by someone like myself, ... (to show) 
if I did it, they could do it too.”

For becoming a leader to be 

a tangible goal, people need to 
see others in those roles that 
look like themselves. In this way, 
Howard serves as a role model for 
hundreds of thousands of young 
Black individuals. He knows that 
he has to set a good example and 
encourage them to chase their 
dream no matter what people tell 
them, especially in a job where he 
represents a small minority.

The lack of Black representation 

in leadership roles, specifically 
coaching, is one that will not be 
solved overnight. But, Howard 
says, 
the 
magnitude 
of 
this 

problem can’t serve as a deterrent. 
Change needs to happen, whether 
it’s by implementing affirmative 
action rules like the Rooney Rule 
in the NFL or simply giving others 
a chance. 

As Howard has shown, there 

are many capable individuals out 
there. And sometimes, that chance 
is all they need.

Wolverines making progress physically 

and mentally as practice start looms

While 
its 
season 
is 
not 

scheduled to begin until Nov. 25, 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team has been hard at work for 
months.

Official practices won’t begin 

until Oct. 14, but teams have 
been permitted to work out 
together. 

“It’s been great to get guys 

back into the gym,” Michigan 
coach Juwan Howard said. 
“They’re looking forward to the 
opportunity of getting better.”

After having the rug pulled 

out 
from 
underneath 
them 

just moments before their first 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament 
game 

against Rutgers, the Wolverines 
have been anxious to have an 
opportunity to make some noise 
in the postseason. Assistant 
coach Phil Martelli admitted 
that the uncertainty over this 
season 
prevented 
the 
team 

from fully locking into summer 
workouts, but the NCAA’s mid-
September 
announcement 

confirming a season would be 
played has flipped a switch. 

“There’s a vibe, there’s an 

excitement (now), about having 
a chance to pursue a Big Ten 
championship,” Martelli said. 

According to Martelli, the 

improvements made by the team 

in workouts have been evident. 
He remarked that senior guard 
Adrien Nuñez has become a more 
physical and confident presence 
on the court, and senior guard 
Eli Brooks has significantly 
improved his basketball IQ. 
Martelli also added that senior 
forward Isaiah Livers has been a 
stabilizing presence for the team 
as it prepares for the season, 
both due to his ability to mentor 
younger players and perform 
well himself on the floor during 
team scrimmages.

While they may not be big 

names, 
Martelli 
made 
sure 

to mention that Howard has 
routinely taken a chance to 
break down plays and game 
film with his walk-ons, often 
going into the same amount of 
time and detail with them as he 
does with the team’s scholarship 
players. 

“I told him that’s why he’s 

gonna be great at this (job),” 
Martelli said. “His care and 
concern for each individual, 
person first, player second, is 
why I’m convinced he’s a star.”

Howard’s 
attention 
to 

walk-ons is reflective of his 
commitment to caring for his 
players. During quarantine, he 
kept in touch with the team over 
Zoom to check in on the well-
being of his players on a weekly 
basis. Howard and Martelli also 
coordinated with strength coach 

Jon Sanderson to help curate 
workout plans for the players to 
do while in quarantine.

Martelli 
stressed, 
though, 

that until they were cleared to 
workout in June, almost every 
conversation between coaches 
and their players focused on 
mental health, believing that it 
was their utmost priority during 
an unprecedented time.

“Everything 
during 
the 

pandemic was centered on their 
mental and physical well-being,” 
Martelli said. “It just wasn’t the 
time to talk basketball.”

With the season’s tipoff just 

over one month away, Martelli 
looks forward to having a 
chance to put the team’s hard 
work and mental preparation on 
display on the court. While he 
felt that the adjustment period 
during and after the pandemic 
was a difficult one, Martelli says 
that he couldn’t be more excited 
to work with Howard, both 
the coach and the person, for a 
second season.

“It was different being home 

for four months,” Martelli said. 
“But the energy in recruiting 
and the energy of teaching on 
the floor is laser vision for me in 
that I wanna be by his side when 
he coaches on a Monday night 
in April. No one is destined to 
do that, but if someone has the 
ability to do it, I know for sure 
that I’m in the right place.”

‘Why not me?’: For Juwan Howard, lack of Black coaches is personal

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily

Michigan men’s basketball coach Juwan Howard is one of just 14 Black head coaches in college basketball’s six major conferences.

John Beilein is back at home in Ann Arbor

John Beilein’s press conferences 

last January in Cleveland were 
tense, a little gruff, almost defensive. 
The NBA had not been kind to him, 
and it showed. 

That is not the John Beilein who 

spoke with The Daily on Tuesday 
afternoon, back in Michigan, where 
he became a beloved figure from 
2007-2019.

The John Beilein of Tuesday 

afternoon is relaxed. Happy. His 
excitement is measurable as he 
talks about getting to play tennis 
for the first time in seventeen years, 
gleefully adding that his golf game 
has improved like you wouldn’t 
believe. He talks about getting to 
spend time with his grandkids, his 
smile practically audible through 
the phone.

John Beilein has come home to 

Ann Arbor, and it has made a world 
of difference. 

***
If 
there’s 
one 
thing 
that 

retirement 
has 
taught 
the 

winningest men’s basketball coach 
in school history, it’s how to teach a 
dog some new tricks.

I don’t say old dog, because 

Beilein and his wife Kathleen have 
recently adopted a puppy. In his 
spare time, Beilein’s been reading up 
on dog training strategies — by my 
estimate, the puppy will be barking 
at pick-and-rolls by Thanksgiving.

But Beilein has picked up some 

new tricks, too. He’s teaching a class 
at Michigan this semester, and, as a 
result of the coronavirus pandemic, 
it’s all online. So Beilein has learned 
how to use Zoom, with some 
help from his graduate student 
instructor. 

But even with the technology 

challenges, Beilein, who hasn’t 
taught since he was a high school 
coach in 1978, is thrilled to get back 
in the classroom.

“I’ve loved it,” he said. “I have a 

whole new respect for the faculty, 
and all the preparation that you 
have to do, and how hard it is to do 
a Zoom class of 66 students as well. 
But I’ve loved every minute of it. 
Teaching leadership, coaching, it’s 
really empowering.”

It’s a natural next step for Beilein. 

He gave a graduation address to the 
School of Education in 2019, and 
when Dean Elizabeth Moje asked 
him if he’d ever be interested in 
teaching, the answer was absolutely 
— as soon as he was done coaching. 
When things didn’t work out in 
Cleveland, Beilein called Moje, and 
in a few months’ time, he found 
himself the lead instructor of EDUC 
240.

His coaching days may be over, 

but Beilein is hoping to have as 
much impact on his students as he 
once did on his players. In his spare 
time, he’s reading everything he 
can find on how to be an effective 
leader (never mind the dozens of 
basketball players who’ll tell you in 
a heartbeat that he already is one). 

It’s clearly prescient — the course 

is titled “Coaching as Leading” — 

but it doesn’t even begin to scratch 
the surface of things Beilein wants 
to learn about with all his newfound 
time. When he’s asked what he’s 
most excited about, he pauses for 
several seconds trying to decide.

“I’m a lifetime learner,” Beilein 

says. “That will never stop. There’s 
all kinds of things. Knowledge is 
powerful. And I’m always looking 
for new ways to learn more about 
the world and how it works.”

But 
his 
excitement 
about 

learning doesn’t stop at the end of 
his lengthy reading list. Beilein is 
learning as much from the class as 
his students are, he says.

“Well, the Zoom thing is new,” he 

laughs. “But we’re reading all types 
of resources that we’re getting more 
information from, and the speakers 
that we’ve had come in — you’re 
always learning from them.”

***
It speaks volumes of Juwan 

Howard’s success in his first season 
as the Wolverines’ head coach that 
when Beilein left Cleveland, there 
was barely any talk — and none of it 
serious — of Beilein returning to his 
old role. 

It’s a good thing, too, because 

Beilein recognizes it as much as the 
rest of us: Michigan is done with the 
Beilein era. It’s Howard’s program 
now.

“I just have a lot of respect for 

Juwan and the team,” Beilein said. 
“I don’t want to do anything that 
would be a distraction.”

But that doesn’t mean Beilein 

doesn’t 
care 
about 
Michigan 

basketball 
anymore. 
COVID-19 

restrictions have prevented him 
from attending any practices with 

the team as of yet, but provided 
he’s not stepping on anybody’s toes, 
Beilein is more than ready to get 
back to work in Crisler Center.

“If and when — I’m going to do 

it whenever I can possibly do it,” 
Beilein said. 

He’s smiling through the phone 

again. Beilein clearly still cares 
deeply about Michigan basketball. 
It’s what made Ann Arbor home.

Even when he was the head 

coach in Cleveland, that was always 
the case. And eventually, no matter 
what the NBA brought, he was 
always going to come back someday.

“We never sold our house in 

Ann Arbor — we didn’t even try 
to,” Beilein said. “We were going to 
sell it in the spring, but when things 
didn’t work out in Cleveland, it was 
easy… We call Ann Arbor home. We 
have for thirteen years.”

John Beilein has found an enjoyable new life in his return to Ann Arbor.


With experience in athletics 
and medicine, Alex Sobczak 

understands both sides

Former Michigan softball 

player 
Alex 
Sobczak 
used 

to devote hours upon hours 
every 
week 
to 
practice, 

games, 
conditioning 
and 

team activities. The rest of 
her waking hours were spent 
working on her Biopsychology, 
Cognition and Neuroscience 
degree to prepare her for 
medical school.

Since graduating in 2019, 

Sobczak has spent the past year 
researching topics in medicine 
at the University of Michigan’s 
hospital system and applying 
to medical schools. While she 
hasn’t finalized her decision, 
Sobczak’s research has already 
been valuable. She studies 
opioids and transplants, but 
more recently 
has conducted 
research 
on 

COVID-19. 

In 
doing 

so, 
Sobczak 

has 
garnered 

a 
wealth 
of 

knowledge 
about 
the 

virus. Despite 
what 
she 

now 
knows, 

for 
Sobczak, 

what she still 
doesn’t know 
is her primary 
reason 
for 

concern. 
Especially 
as 

it 
surrounds 

athletics.

“I think there’s just a lot of 

misconceptions about COVID-
19 right now,” Sobczak said. 
“As a healthy 23-year old, I 
get that somebody my age isn’t 
going to be super concerned 
about getting a severe case of 
COVID-19, but in all honesty, 
nobody really knows the long-
term effects of it.”

The mystery of the possible 

long-term effects, put simply, 
is quite worrying. And for 
anyone on the outside of a 
sport looking in, that’s why 
universities and conferences 
are so apprehensive to begin 
play — they don’t know what 
could happen to these players 
in the future after contracting 
the virus. 

Not only are they young, 

as Sobczak mentioned, but 
college athletes are in fantastic 
shape. The likelihood of an 
athlete having a severe case 
that lands them hospitalized 
is minimal, but the possible 
underlying after-effects, such 
as 
myocarditis 
and 
other 

unknowns, 
are 
concerning. 

In order to play, these risks 
must be minimized as much 
as possible. The decision to 
be made is how strict these 
restrictions and precautions 
need to be.

“I think you’re going to 

have to sacrifice on both 
ends,” Sobczak said. “ … You 

don’t want to put players’ 
health 
at 
risk. 
Especially 

not knowing the long term 
effects of COVID-19 and how 
it affects the organs. I would 
be concerned playing right 
now personally. I think it’s 
so hard to keep a bubble right 
now, especially on a college 
campus, and I guess it’s really 
up to weighing the sacrifices 
on both ends and what that 
looks like.”

With the near-impossible 

implementation of a bubble 
on a college campus, the 
preventative 
measures 
fall 

squarely 
on 
three 
things: 

masks, testing and staying 
within the team’s rudimentary 
bubble. And with cases on the 
rise as football, fall and winter 
sports start dates approach, 
those two elements become 
even more important.

Still, 

Sobczak 
understands 
the 
desire 

for 
athletes 

to play. She 
herself was a 
player, and she 
knows plenty 
of athletes on 
the 
softball 

team 
and 

elsewhere. 
Athletics 
is 

their 
escape. 

It is their way 
to cope with 
the stress, fear 
and 
anxiety 

surrounding 
the pandemic. 
For many, it 

is a huge part of their life and 
of who they are. For some, it 
might even be their profession, 
such as Sobczak’s fiancé, Nick 
Plummer, an outfielder in the 
St. Louis Cardinals’ minor 
league system.

“Being engaged to somebody 

who’s in baseball right now, I 
think it’s really hard to see 
that he can’t play his sport,” 
Sobczak said. “It’s devastating 
when you work your whole life 
for something and you don’t 
know when you’re going to get 
back to it and it’s an outlet for 
you. I think that’s been hard. 
It’s weighed on a lot of us. It 
weighed on me.”

Despite 
the 
difficulty, 

Sobczak is glad her fiancé is 
not playing. The health risks, to 
her, justify personal decisions 
not to play when protocol isn’t 
air tight, such as in the MLB 
and affiliate leagues as well 
as college campuses where 
a bubble is unlikely and the 
virus can spread rapidly.

In her eyes, to proceed, not 

only do you need multiple 
levels 
of 
precaution, 
but 

you need to be aware of the 
consequences.

“As 
much 
as 
you 
love 

sports,” Sobczak said, “you 
have to watch out for people’s 
health and be concerned about 
the aftermath for something 
like this.”

How Paul Juda continued to perfect his craft 

during COVID-19

With gyms closed and no 

end to quarantine in sight, 
Paul 
Juda 
initially 
found 

it challenging to motivate 
himself. Juda, a sophomore 
standout and reigning Big Ten 
Freshman of The Year on the 
Michigan men’s gymnastics 
team, decided to use the 
unexpected 
shut-down 
to 

take time off from his intense 
training regimen.

“Athletes are humans too, at 

least I am,” Juda said. “I let my 
body take a little bit of a break. 
You never know how stressed 
out you are until you take a 
break.” 

But the time off, his first 

in a long while, gave Juda a 
new perspective on the sport 
he loves and trains for every 
single day. 

“Staying at home for the 

first time without gymnastics 
for an extended period of time, 
and getting back in the gym 
that first day,” Juda said, “that 
makes you really remember 
why you fell in love with the 
sport to begin with.”

Juda 
conditioned 

throughout 
the 
quarantine 

through 
home 
workouts 

hosted over Zoom, but his first 
time back in the gym and being 
able to perform even basic 
gymnastics sets inspired him 
to take advantage of the break. 

“I did a lot of cardio on 

my stationary bike at home,” 
Juda said. “Every hour that 
I spent on there sweating it 
out, I thought about how much 
closer I would be than the 
next guy who’s doing nothing 
during this break. 

“That kind of pushed me the 

most, the thought that these 
hours that you don’t get back, 
I’m using them to get over the 
edge.”

That 
mentality 
is 
what 

propelled Juda even before 
coming to Michigan when 
he was competing against 
international gymnasts and 
placing in the top three against 
Olympians at the United States 
Senior Championship in 2019.

Still, 
the 
transition 
to 

Michigan and a Division I 
program wasn’t as easy as it 
would seem, even for someone 
as talented as Juda. 

“It 
wasn’t 
all 
sunshine 

and rainbows,” Juda said. 
“Adjusting to the academics 
and the amount of work it 
takes to compete at this level 

was tougher than I expected. 
I got homesick for sure, even 
though my parents were close 
by.” 

But by his second semester, 

Juda set a goal to become 
a leader for the team in all 
aspects, 
even 
on 
a 
team 

primarily 
composed 
of 

upperclassmen. 
He 
pushed 

for 
an 
environment 
that 

only 
accepts 
excellence, 

which carries into the team’s 
dynamic this year and going 
forward.

“All that really changed for 

me this year is my class rank,” 
Juda said. “I’m still trying to 
achieve the same goals I set 
since I got here. It’s demanding 
excellence and being your 
best.”

The team has also changed 

with a lot of fresh faces, giving 
Juda a new perspective on the 
upcoming season. 

“Having a younger team is 

really good for me because I 
like the idea of showing people 
the steps they should follow 
and guiding them towards 
using intelligent moves in the 
gym,” Juda said. “I can sense 
the hunger from the guys 
without having to motivate 
them too much.”

He and the team continue 

to have high expectations 
for their future and aim to 
bring Michigan the NCAA 
Championship that the team 
worked tirelessly for during 
last year before their season 
was canceled. 

Amid 
adjusting 
to 
U-M 

academics, with his mentality 
pushing him, Juda was also 
selected for the United States 
Men’s Senior National Team 
in 
February, 
becoming 
its 

youngest 
member 
at 
just 

19 years old. The day after, 
Juda was selected for the 
Pan American Games, one of 
the 
now-postponed 
Tokyo 

Olympics qualifier events for 
the U.S. But yet again, Juda 
looks at this temporary pause 
as a building block to his 
eventual goal.

“If 
anything, 
this 

postponement of the Olympics 
is 
only 
advantageous 
to 

someone in my particular 
situation,” he said. “It’s a 
whole year of development for 
me, and I focus on training 
through efficiency and not 
wasting the time I have. 
What’s most important for 
me going forward is my body, 
mind, and nutrition while 
being happy and staying close 
with my teammates.”

This 
past 
August, 
the 

Michigan golf teams and Ann 
Arbor community lost a key 
member in Charlie Green, who 
passed away at age 84. 

For the typical Michigan fan, 

Charlie’s would not exactly be 
considered a household name. 
But, to many entrenched in 
the golf lore here at Michigan, 
Charlie Green was synonymous 
with the program. 

Charlie served as clubhouse 

manager for the U-M Golf 
Course for 52 years. His role in 
this position was not only crucial 
to the course’s operation, but 
also to the golf teams as a whole.

“Being there so much, he 

obviously knew all of the golf 
coaches 
and 
the 
teams 
in 

particular,” Charlie’s son, Sean 
Green said. “As they were going 
off on golf trips, he would be 
there, pretty often to send them 
off on the bus. He always took an 
active interest in all the players 
and the team.”

Seeing as his career lasted 

five decades, Charlie took pride 
in the seemingly more mundane 
parts of his work as clubhouse 
manager; he helped organize 
club outings, oversaw day to day 
operations, managed staff and 
worked hands on to set up for 
important course events. But 
beyond this, Charlie was as close 
as one could get to an honorary 
member of the Wolverines’ golf 
programs.

“Charlie’s office was the first 

thing that any guest or staff 
member saw when they came 
into the clubhouse,” former 
Michigan coach Chris Whitten 
said. “Charlie was really my 
introduction to the athletic 
department, to golf at Michigan 
in general, and really the history 
of the athletic department and 
the people who had been a part 
of it.”

In addition to serving the 

golf course in any way possible, 
Charlie continued to be a beacon 
of warm nature and created 
a welcoming atmosphere for 
golfers. Many have said that 
Charlie made everyone on the 
team feel more at home, and 
made the university a little bit 
smaller.

“(Charlie) 
represented 
a 

connection 
to 
(the 
players), 

and he is one of the people that 
created a new home away from 
home for these young kids 
coming to a big University for 
the first time,” Whitten said. 
“He was kind of like the father, 
or grandfather figure for a lot of 
those kids.”

Charlie was not your typical 

clubhouse manager. Often, he 
made it a part of his job to take 
interest in the lives of players. 
Unlike many coaches they may 
have 
encountered, 
Charlie 

more than anything else was 
particularly interested in what 
Whitten referred to as “non-golf 
things.” These often included 
how 
players’ 
families 
were 

doing, how school was going 
and what they were interested in 
off the course. Having a person 
like Charlie ask about these 

things every day helped make 
the clubhouse feel like a second 
home.

“The coaches see the kids 

every day … we skip some of the 
personal stuff, just ‘How are 
you doing?’ ” Whitten said. “The 
fact that they had to walk past 
Charlie’s door before they got to 
the coaches, he got to ask them 
how they were as people.”

Today, a lasting memory of 

Charlie persists in the form of 
a plaque at the tee of the sixth 
hole, commemorating his career. 
The hole serendipitously named 
for Charlie was his favorite. It 
was endowed in his name by 
university donor John Buck in 
2001, and it is often described as 
one of the most memorable and 
masterful holes at the course.

“(Buck) wanted to make a 

gift to the university,” Sean 
Green said. “But, the first thing 
he thought of was my dad. He 
wanted my dad recognized for 
all of the hours and effort he 
put in at the course, and with 
athletics in general.”

Sean recounted that the hole’s 

endowment “brought tears” to 
Charlie’s eyes. It was a profound 
commemoration 
of 
a 
truly 

profound career and man. 

The 
hole 
itself 
could 

certainly be described as the 
most memorable on the course. 
Whitten described it in detail: 
“The hole is really unique. The 
design of the green, the length of 
the hole, the strategy options, it 
definitely is the hole that people 
remember when they think of 
the course.”

Although arguably the most 

significant hole at the course was 
named after him, Charlie never 
let it affect his work. 

“While 
he 
was 
deeply 

thankful for it, he treated 
everyone the same still and was 
always willing to help and be 
hands on,” Sean Green said.

Charlie also was a major 

proponent of women’s sports at 
Michigan. He was incredibly 
passionate about the promotion 
of the women’s golf team in its 
inception.

“He really thought it was 

extremely important for women 
to have the opportunity to play. 
… It was really about equality,” 
women’s golf coach Jan Dowling 
said. 

Charlie was always incredibly 

interested in making the course 
more playable and providing 
opportunities for all people to 
play and participate.

Dowling said Charlie wanted 

to “grow the game” and make 
the course more accessible. 
Dowling recounted a story about 
the “women’s” tees at the course.

“They’re not the ‘women’s 

tees,’ he calls them the maize 
tees,” Dowling said. “Guys can 
play it, girls can play it, it was 
really all about equality.”

To commemorate his passion 

for women’s sports, the women’s 
golf league at the course has a 
tournament named in his honor.

Charlie’s presence in the 

clubhouse was an important one. 
He played a vital role for so many 
members of the golf teams, and 
his story and contributions will 
be commemorated by course-
goers for years to come.

As his senior season nears, Kwity Paye’s 

Michigan career comes into focus

As the Big Ten’s 2020 football 

season hung in the balance 
leading up to this fall, senior 
defensive end Kwity Paye had “a 
million people” in his ear. Some 
told him he should hold out hope 
for a season and remain in Ann 
Arbor. Others thought opting out 
and declaring for the NFL Draft 
would be a better long-term 
choice.

But in Paye’s eyes, it was never 

much of a dilemma.

“I came back for a reason,” 

Paye said on a Zoom call with 
reporters Thursday. “I didn’t 
come back just to say, ‘Oh, I was 
coming back.’ I came back to play 
a season, so that was the only 
thing going that was through my 
head. That’s why I stayed so long, 
just because I got my hopes up 
playing this season.

“… I wanted to graduate, I 

wanted to play a season, and 
that’s what I did. I’m not really 
the type of person to take advice 
from other people. As my mom 
would say, I’m real stubborn 
and once I have my heart set 
on something, I like to see it 
through. I came here for four 
years and I’m happy with that.”

With the Big Ten football 

season set to begin in a little more 
than two weeks, Paye’s career has 
come into focus. Three years ago, 
he arrived in Ann Arbor as the 
third-lowest-ranked 
prospect 

in the Wolverines’ heralded 

2017 recruiting class — a group 
that ranked No. 5 nationally, 
according to 247Sports.

Last October, Paye recalled a 

moment during his recruitment 
when a Michigan fan called him 
a “three-star bum” on social 
media. The comment stuck with 
him. By flipping his commitment 
from Boston College to Michigan, 
Paye got his first taste of what it’s 
like to drown out the noise.

“I still remember when I 

decommitted 
from 
Boston 

College,” Paye said. “When I 
committed to (Michigan), people 
were like, ‘Oh no, you’re not 
going to play. You’re making a 
big mistake. Don’t do it.’ All these 
years later, all it took was hard 
work and consistency and I am 
where I am.”

Now 
a 
senior, 
Paye 
has 

emerged as a crucial piece of 
the Wolverines’ defense. He 
recorded a team-high 12.5 tackles 
for loss last season — including 
6.5 sacks — and added three 
quarterback hurries. When the 
team’s back was against the wall 
against Army, Paye recovered 
the game-winning fumble in 
double-overtime.

After a junior season of 

wreaking havoc in the run game, 
Paye used the offseason to zero 
in on improving elsewhere.

“I didn’t show enough of (my 

pass-rush moves) last year,” Paye 
said. “That’s because I didn’t 
feel like I focused on it a lot last 
year, but this offseason I really 
focused on my go-to move and 
then my counter and then just 

really working on my pass rush. 
Last year, I would say I was 
really more of a run defender but 
now this year I’ve kind of worked 
the pass rush into there as well.”

With Michigan’s top pass-

rusher from last season, Josh 
Uche, now in the NFL, Paye 
and junior defensive end Aidan 
Hutchinson will be asked to 
pressure the quarterback even 
more. If Paye answers the 
call, it’ll further cement his 
projection as a top pick in the 
2021 NFL Draft. CBS Sports’ 
latest mock draft featured Paye 
at No. 10 overall on Wednesday, 
while other outlets have floated 
his name as a potential first-
round selection.

So far, Paye checks all the 

boxes — he’s put plenty of 
highlights on tape and his 
reputation and physical abilities 
precede him. He topped The 
Athletic’s list of “freaks” across 
college football in July, and 
his 6.37 three-cone drill time, 
sub-4.6 40-yard dash time and 
34-inch vertical make it easy to 
see why. 

That leaves only one thing left 

to accomplish.

“I have no rings,” Paye said. 

“I came to the University to 
be a champion, and I’m yet 
to be a champion. I’m trying 
to accomplish that one thing 
because I feel like I’ve done 
everything I’m supposed to do. … 
This is my last year. I’m giving it 
all I got. This team is giving it all 
we’ve got.

“Just trying to get that ring.”

T

here’s a small, 
white house a few 
blocks from Mich-
igan Stadium.

Most months, it sits empty, 

even as the surrounding 
neighborhood is packed with 
student renters. 
But seven 
Saturdays 
a year, Paul 
Furlo and 
his friends 
descend on 
the house, 
which they 
purchased 
a few years 
ago to 
enhance 
their game-
day experience. “Little house 
at the Big House,” Furlo calls 
it.

Their routine, by now, is 

set in stone. They cater the 
same order from Zingerman’s, 
coupled with a few kegs set 
up in the backyard. In early 
September, before the weather 
gets too cold, they bring along 
their small children, hoping 
to indoctrinate them into the 
tradition.

This year, that opportunity 

is already past — Michigan’s 
home slate won’t start until 
Halloween. But when it does, 
Furlo and his friends will still 
be there, looking longingly at 
Michigan Stadium from the 
outside.

“We’re gonna enjoy those 

home games still,” Furlo said. 
“But we’re gonna enjoy them 
on the many big screens at our 
house in Ann Arbor and we’ll 

socially distance and still enjoy 
the games and still be able to 
be in our favorite college town 
to watch games on TV.”

Furlo isn’t the only one 

who’s planning to continue 
his tailgating tradition even as 
fans are barred from attend-
ing games. A few blocks away, 
Eric Metzendorf and his wife, 
Lauren, are planning to do the 
same.

The Metzendorfs moved to 

Ann Arbor in 1999 for Eric’s 
job and immediately bought 
season tickets. Occasionally, 
they’ll miss a game or two for 
weekend trips, but this season 
would have been their 22nd 

in a row attending at least a 
handful of games. “We buy 
them because we enjoy going,” 
Metzendorf said of his season 
tickets.

This year, the Metzendorfs 

— along with more than 70,000 
other season-ticket holders — 
won’t have that opportunity. 
Instead, they’ll have a few 
friends over and tailgate at 
home like they usually do for 
away games. If the weather 
cooperates, Eric says, they 
might venture downtown to 
watch games at restaurants 
with outdoor seating.

“What’s interesting too is 

I’m paying attention to the col-

lege football season, but really 
not as much,” Metzendorf said. 
“I’m not as intent to watch 
games until Michigan starts 
playing.”

Like for Furlo and every 

other season-ticket holder, it 
won’t be the same. But Michi-
gan fans are taking the small 
victories as they come. Met-
zendorf was thrilled to learn 
that the Ohio State game is 
back in its traditional spot as 
the season finale, moved back 
from an earlier schedule itera-
tion that placed it in October. 
“I said, ‘OK all is right with the 
schedule again,’ ” Metzendorf 
said.

For Steve Raymond, a long-

time season-ticket holder, the 
relief came earlier, when the 
Big Ten announced games 
would be closed to fans. While 
Furlo said he would con-
sider attending games with 
minimized capacity, Raymond 
opted out of his job as an event 
staffer back when Michigan 
was considering allowing fans.

“I am perfectly happy to 

sit this season out,” Raymond 
said. “Because I’m of an age 
where I feel like the risk is not 
worth it to me for my own per-
sonal health.”

Unlike Furlo and Metzen-

dorf, he doesn’t plan to host 

tailgates or watch parties. Still, 
he’s excited for the normalcy 
that college football will bring, 
even if it’s just on TV.

What won’t be the same is 

the lack of non-revenue sports. 
Since moving to Ann Arbor in 
1970, Raymond’s been to watch 
every Michigan sport except 
tennis. Soccer, track and field 
and softball are among his 
favorites. None of those will be 
open to fans this year.

So instead, Raymond will 

be stuck at home watching not 
just football, but every other 
sport as they gradually return 
to play. It won’t be an entirely 
foreign experience — Raymond 
has watched home games on 
TV before — but it brings a dif-
ferent air to fall in Ann Arbor.

Season-ticket holders, like 

everyone else, will miss the 
little things about game days. 
They’ll miss the walk down 
Main Street to the stadium and 
the kettle corn once they get 
there. They’ll miss that first 
sight of the field each Septem-
ber and the camaraderie of 
singing the fight song together 
after touchdowns.

And even when they get 

together for their tailgates and 
watch parties, it won’t quite be 
the same.

“When you lose something 

great like Michigan football,” 
Furlo said, “it makes sure that 
none of us take it for granted.”

‘It makes sure that none of us take it for granted’: Season-ticket 

holders prepare for season without fans

THEO
MACKIE

ALEC COHEN/Daily

Michigan Football season ticket holders are coming up with creative ways to keep the gameday tradition alive despite not being at the games in-person.

Versatility and explosive plays set to 

determine ceiling of Michigan’s run game

A year ago, Zach Charbonnet 

and Hassan Haskins combined 
for 1,348 yards and 15 touchdowns 
on 270 carries. For Michigan, it 
was a promising revelation. Two 
players who had never played a 
college snap proved they could be 
trusted to take over the backfield 
from Karan Higdon.

And yet, as a whole, the 

Wolverines produced their least 
effective rushing offense of the 
Jim Harbaugh era. In his first 
four years, Michigan averaged 
188.3 rushing yards per game on 
4.5 yards per carry. Last year, 
those numbers dropped to 151.2 
and 4.0.

The problem, as running backs 

coach Jay Harbaugh alludes to 
now, may have been a lack of 
versatility.

Jay Harbaugh won’t come out 

and say as much. Charbonnet and 
Haskins were both objectively 
good last year. Criticizing them 
for having similar skill sets would 
be both unfair and unhelpful.

But in Jay Harbaugh’s praise 

of Chris Evans, who is returning 
from 
a 
year-long 
academic 

suspension, his recognition of the 
pair’s flaws is evident.

“Being able to have a guy who 

excels outside the tackles,” Jay 
Harbaugh said, “helps balance 
out Zach and Hassan who are 
good out there, but they’re special 
inside the box.”

This year, Evans and freshman 

Blake Corum will provide just 
that. But while Corum — the 
12th-ranked 2020 running back, 
per 247Sports — will have to 
adapt to the college game as 
Charbonnet did a year ago, Evans 
will need no such adjustment. In 
three seasons at Michigan, he’s 
rushed for 1,722 yards on 304 
carries, good for 5.7 yards per 
attempt.

“As far as where I see myself 

at, I’m wherever they need 
me at,” Evans said on Sept. 11. 
“Whatever’s gonna put the team 
in the best situation.”

Evans’ stats through three 

seasons are a testament to his 
explosiveness — something Jay 
Harbaugh referenced repeatedly 
last week. But the 101 carries 
per season are also a testament 
to what Evans isn’t. Two inches 

shorter than Charbonnet and 
Haskins, Evans was reared as a 
high school wide receiver. His 
frame, even now, isn’t designed to 
take 224 carries, as Higdon did in 
2018.

In other words, his skill set 

should comport perfectly with 
those of Charbonnet and Haskins. 
That extends beyond the running 
game, too. A year ago, Michigan’s 
top four backs combined for 
20 receptions. In 2018, Evans 
notched 18 on his own.

“Chris, he’s just different than 

a standard back,” Jay Harbaugh 
said. “… Last year, you would 
say a lot of times, the guys we 
had on the field, they’d get out 
on check downs where they 
weren’t really a factor in the 
quarterback’s thought process, in 
his progression.

“A guy like Chris, who can 

beat the majority of linebackers 
or safeties he runs a route on 
and then he can make the play 
and catch the ball, that adds 
an element where you can 
include the running back in the 
progression.”

For the Wolverines to bolster 

their running game, though, 
Evans alone can’t be responsible. 
In 2018, when Michigan gained 
203.8 yards per game on the 
ground, Higdon paced the team 
with 5.3 yards per carry.

Last season, Charbonnet and 

Haskins managed just 4.9 and 
5.1, respectively. The gap between 
those numbers and Higdon’s 
might not seem substantial on 
balance, but over the course of 
270 carries, it cost the Wolverines 

over 100 yards a year ago.

To 
bridge 
that 
gap, 
Jay 

Harbaugh says, Michigan needs 
to transform more pedestrian 
five-yard gains into 20-yard 
chunk plays.

That’s where months of Zoom 

meetings came into play, back 
before 
the 
Wolverines 
were 

even able to resume small group 
workouts in June. Admittedly, 
speed, balance and change of 
direction all play a role in the 
ability to break off explosive 
plays. More important, though, is 

the mental aspect.

Michigan’s running backs need 

to be able to identify opposing 
defensive schemes so that they 
can see where the defense is 
trying to funnel them and do the 
opposite. But simply identifying 
the 
defense’s 
direction 
isn’t 

sufficient. In concert with the 
offensive line, running backs 
have to know which defenders 
are supposed to be in which 
gaps, allowing them to spot 
holes before they open and avoid 
the opponent’s free hitter — the 
unblocked cornerback or safety 
designated to make the tackle.

Explaining this in a Zoom 

call with local media, though, 
won’t transform the Wolverines’ 
running game. Jay Harbaugh’s 
message, so sound in theory, now 
lies in the hands of his players.

“I would love to hear you ask 

those guys that,” he said when 
asked 
how 
to 
manufacture 

explosive plays. “Just to see how 
much they’ve been focusing on it 
and if they’ve internalized stuff.”

In two weeks, he’ll find out.
