'U' invests $814.8
million in energy

FLY HIGH LIKE PAPER

All companies in
portfolio part of
oil industry
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily News Editor
When University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman
announced an array of Uni-
versity sustainability initia-
tives, the cost of the programs
amounted to a $14 million
investment.
However, the University
also committed $60 million
to the energy sector of its
long-term portfolio last June,
composed entirely of compa-
nies associated with oil.
About half of the longterm
portfolio is composed of mar-
ketable securities, including
cash and equities, while the
other half is made up of alter-
native assets, which is divid-
ed into four different sectors
- venture capital, private
equity, real estate and energy.
Returns to the University's
endowment help contrib-
ute to sustainability efforts
among other things, and were
worth $7.8 billion last June.
Of that $7.8 billion, $814.8
million was invested in the
energy sector.
In an investments report
distributed to the Univer-

sity's Board of Regents, all 15
of the companies - includ-
ing Merit Energy Company,
Natural Gas Partners, Encap
Energy and Yorktown Energy
Partners - are in the energy
sector and related to the oil
industry. While the inve§t-
ment report does not spe-
cifically say that all of the
companies invested in by the
University are associated
with oil, the individual com-
panies listed in the report
all support, finance or invest
in oil companies by, among
other things, acquiring prop-
erty with producingreserves,
investing in drilling andtech-
nology or investing equity in
oil companies.
At 10 percent, most of
the endowment invested in
energy and subsequently, oil
companies, is lower than the
other investment sectors but
it had a large return for the
endowment last year at 30
percent, or about $244.4 mil-
lion - far more than the $14
million sustainability invest-
ment.
"Oil prices ended the year
approximately 30 percent
higher than at the begin-
ning and natural gas prices
remained relatively flat,"
the University's investment
report reads. "The increase in
oil prices positively impacted
the valuations of the reserves

held by our reserve acquisi-
tion managers and the energy
private equity managers in
our portfolio continued to
take advantage of a strong
market to sell portfolio com-
panies."
Despite increasing oil pric-
es that contribute to the posi-
tive endowment return, the
University invested nearly
$3 million, accompanied by
a $720,000 grant from the
Department of Energy, to
purchase seven hybrid buses.
The University also spent
$700,000, in addition to a
$60,000 from another DOE
grant to purchase hybrid
sedans for the University's
fleet.
Fitzgerald said the Uni-
versity prefers to not com-
ment about detailed investing
choices like the number of oil
companies invested in.
"We specifically as a Uni-
versity take an approach of
not talking in detail about our
investments because invest-
ments are something that
people are constantly looking
at to try to get hints," Fitzger-
ald said.

Former Gov. takes
46 percent of vote,

By ANDREW SCHULMAN

Former Massachusetts Gov.
Mitt Romney earned a double-
digit victory in last night's Florida

Republican presidential primary,
as he fought off criticism from
rivals and a possible surge by for-
mer House Speaker Newt Gin-
grich.
Romney, who has won every
Republican primary contest thus
far except for a defeat in South
Carolina on Jan. 21, seized 46
percent of the vote, outpacing
his nearest rival, Gingrich, by 14
percent. The victory extends the

work toward
safer campus
New group to
try to increase
collaboration
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor
Six months after a string of
assaults occurred near campus,
University organizations are still
working to increase safety initia-
tives in the community.
Last September, students and
University officials launched
Beyond the Diag, a program
aimed to raise awareness of
student safety and commu-
nity involvement in response
to four sexual assaults and two
other assaults that occurred in
July. In addition to this group, a
newly formed organization aims
to unite the Ann Arbor Police
Department, the University's
Department of Public Safety and
the University's Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Cen-
ter in an effort to continue to pro-
mote community well-being.
The recent partnership, the
Student Safety Workgroup, is
part of a collaboration with Holly

Schuette files
motion with state
Supreme Court
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily News Editor
Michigan Attorney Gen-
eral Bill Schuette filed another
motion yesterday in a last-ditch
attempt to postpone today's
hearing before an administrative
judge to determine the ability of
graduate student research assis-
tants to vote on whether they
want to unionize.
Yesterday, Schuette filed an
emergency motion to stay with
the, Michigan Supreme Court.
The attorney general's move is
an attempt to delay the hear-
ing until its conditions have
been changed. In addition to the
motion, Schuette also appealed
a previous ruling made by the
Michigan Employment Relations
Commission that denied him the
right to intervene in the proceed-
ings.
The motion to stay would give
the Michigan Supreme Court
time to reconsider Schuette's
argument and perhaps allow him
to intervene in a future adminis-
trative hearing.
Stephen Raiman, founder of
Students Against GSRA Union-
ization, said though he doesn't
think the hearing will be pushed

back, his group agrees with
Schuette's decision to file the
motion.
"It's what lawyers do," Raiman
said. " ... (they) try everything
(and) explore every avenue.
Rackham student Sam Mont
gomery, president of the Gradu-
ate Employees' Organization
expressed her disappointment
with the motion in a statement
sent to The Michigan Daily yes-
terday.
"We view this as another
attempt to delay due process and
distract from the real intentionof
the MERC proceedings," Mont-
gomery wrote. "We believe that
GSRAs are employees who have
the right to form a union if they
so choose."
Schuette's initial motion to
intervene was denied by MERC
due to a requirement stating that
the case needs to be contentious
for a third-party to intervene,
according to the appeal.
According to Raiman, the
motion's filing implies that those
opposed to GSRA unionization
anticipate that GEO will succeed
in the hearing. Raiman added
that he anticipates the hearing,
which starts today, could last up
to three days.
"We do believe that the hear-
ing wont be fair," Raiman said.
"(There is a) significant unfair
advantage to GEO at the hearing,
so I do believe that it is proper for

* NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
More people stay in
state after years of
population drops
Fewer people - especially
young adults - appear to be leav-
ing Michigan for other states.
-Figures released yesterday
by the Michigan Department of
Technology, Management and
Budget show migration rates of
18- to 24-year-olds weren't as
steep in 2009-10.
The migration rate for ages
18-19 topped 5.5 percent in
2008-09, compared with about
4 percent the following year. For
20- to 24-year-olds, out-of-state
migration was about 5 percent in
2008-09 compared to about 4.5
percent in 2009-10.
State demographer Ken Darga
says "Michigan is finally starting
to add jobs after several years."
Still, more people are moving
out of the state than in.
SALT LAKE, Utah
Boy, 16, charged in
school bomb plot
Authorities yesterday charged
a 16-year-old boy with a felony
in what they say was a plot to
detonate a bomb at a Utah high
school.
The teenager, along with Dal-
lin Morgan, 18, had planned for
months to bomb an assembly at
Roy High School, about 30 miles
north of Salt Lake City, then steal
a plane from a nearby airport
and flee the country, police said.
Both were arrested last week.
Morgan has been charged with
possession of a weapon of mass
destruction. He is set for a court
appearance on Wednesday and
faces a possible life sentence if
convicted on the first-degree
felony charge.
KANEOHE BAY, Hawaii
Marines sentenced
in hazing case
A Hawaii-based Marine lance
corporal will spend 30 days in
jail and have his rank reduced to
private first class for punching
and kicking a fellow Marine who
killed himself shortly afterward,
a judge ruled late Monday, saying
she found no evidence the abuse
led to the suicide.
Lance Cpl. Jacob Jacoby, 21,
who pleaded guilty to assault,
acknowledged he punched and
kicked Lance Cpl. Harry Lew, of
Santa Clara, Calif., out of anger
and frustration that the fellow
Marine repeatedly fell asleep
while on watch for Taliban fight-
ers.
The case involves the actions
of Marines at an isolated patrol
base the U.S. was establishing to
disrupt Taliban drug and weap-
ons trafficking in Helmand prov-
ince.

LONDON
*n a rare move,
former RBS CEO
loses knighthood
The former Royal Bank of
Scotland chief who infuriated
the British public by leading the
bank to near-collapse and then
walking away with a fat pension
was stripped of his knighthood
yesterday, a rare punishment
that puts him in the company of
criminals and dictators.
Queen Elizabeth II "canceled
and annulled" Fred Goodwin's
knighthood for the key role he
played in the failure of RBS, a
financial disaster that helped
trigger the recession in Britain
and forced taxpayers to bail out
the bank, the Cabinet Office said.
Knighthoods are rarely
revoked, but the government
said Goodwin "had brought the
honors system into disrepute"
and that the "scale and severity"
of the impact of his actions made
it an exceptional case.
After losing the honor, Good-
win joins a group that also
includes the British spy Anthony
Blunt, Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe and Romanian
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.

Harvard University
has largest fund at
$31.7 billion
NEW YORK (AP) - College
and university endowments made
gains in the fiscal year that ended
in June, but many are still strug-
gling to make up ground they lost
in 2008 and 2009, according to a
report released yesterday.
Data gathered from 823 U.S.
colleges and universities show
that the institutions' endowments
returned an average of 19.2 per-
cent for the 2011 fiscal year, the
National Association of College
and University Business Officers
and Commonfund said. That's up
from 11.9 percent in fiscal year
2010.
Still, NACUBO President John
Walda said 47 percent of the insti-
tutions have endowment market
values below what they reported
1 2008.
"Even though we had a really
great year, many of our institu-
tions are still not at a point where
they've recovered in terms of
value from the recession," Walda
said.
Harvard University had the
largest endowment of any U.S.
university at $31.7billion, up from
$27.5 billion in fiscal year 2010.
Yale was second with $19.4 billion.
At the other end of the scale were
colleges with small endowments
like Pennsylvania's Keystone Col-
lege with $7.1 million and Tennes-
see's Pellissippi State Community
College with $5.7 million.
Colleges typically spend
around 5 percent of their endow-
ment annually to boost spending
on things like faculty salaries,

student financial aid and other
operating costs. Most colleges
depend largely on tuition revenue
and government support, but at
elite universities, endowment
spending accounts for a substan-
tial partof the budget; at Harvard,
for instance, roughly one-third of
the operating budget comes from
income generated by the univer-
sity's endowment.
Steve McAllister, vice presi-
dent for finance at Washington
and Lee University in Lexington,
Va., said the university's $1.2 bil-
lion endowment allows it to offer
need-based financial aid to 45
percent of students.
"Last year markets were
strong," McAllister said. "You
do have periods like 2008 where
markets are less than coopera-
tive."
The 73 colleges and universi-
ties with endowments over $1 bil-
lion had returns of 20.1 percent
last fiscal year while those under
$25 million showed returns of 17.6
percent.
Verne Sedlacek, president and
CEO of Commonfund, which
manages money for colleges and
other nonprofit institutions, said
many of the smaller institutions
have low-risk investment strate-
gies that don't yield high returns.
Of the 20 largest endowments
on the list, five belong to public
universities such as the Univer-
sity of Texas and the University of
California that are facing budget
pressures from state legislatures.
"The challenge there is to try to
make up for what's going on with
state appropriations," Walda said.
The donations that colleges
rely on to replenish their coffers
also have not rebounded from
pre-recession levels.

California city
stunned by
revelations
SANTA MARIA, Calif. (AP)
When a police officer dies
on the job, a department and
a community mourn togeth-
er. But not this week in Santa
Maria, where they are too
stunned and outraged.
Officer Alberto Covarrubias
Jr. was shot and killed early
Saturday at the end of his shift
working a DUI checkpoint. The
shooter was his best friend on
the force and best man at his
wedding just three weeks ear-
lier.
More shocking still was
that the shooting occurred as
detectives moved in to arrest
Covarrubias, 29, on charges of
having sex with a 17-year-old
girl.
Now, as Covarrubias' family
prepares to bury him without a
police funeral, two retired offi-
cers who spoke to police at the
scene of the shooting offered
new details of the case:
- The girl was a member of
the department's Police Explor-
er program for young people
interested in law enforcement
careers.
L A lieutenant at the check-
point had alerted the officers
assembled, including Covarru-
bias, that the girl was part of an
investigation and that she was
going to be pulled off check-
point duty.
The former officers disclosed

the details to The Associated
Press only on condition of ano-
nymity. Police officials have not
returned repeated calls seeking
comment.
Since the shooting, a memo-
rial of candles and flowers has
risen where Covarrubias was
killed. The death of an officer
on duty is rare, though the city
came close in December when
two were wounded by "friendly
fire" during a botched SWAT
team raid.
"It doesn't make sense," said
Davinder Singh, who manages
the 7-11 store 50 yards from the
memorial. "It's not supposed to
happen that way."
Santa Maria, nestled
between oak-studded hills and
cooled by the Pacific 10 miles
away, is a mixture of 1950s
California and the kind of stuc-
co-clad, cookie-cutter develop-
ment seen elsewhere. Over the
years, Latinos have increasing-
ly moved in to the city about 170
miles northwest of Los Angeles.
It's easy to see their influ-
ence - they now comprise 70
percent of the city's 100,000
residents. A new Rite-Aid drug
store sits around the corner
from a Mexican herbal medi-
cine shop, Clinica Naturista.
And a throw-back hamburger
stand on the main drag serves
menudo, a Mexican stew, on
weekends.
Killings are uncommon; the
city averages less than a half-
dozen homicides a year, mostly
gang-related. But the recent
spate of violence hassome city
officials worried.

"We're in tough times trying

a City Council member who
served 30 years on the Santa
Maria police force.
Police have disclosed few
details about the Covarrubias
case, leaving residents to won-
der why police felt compelled to
make the arrest while the four-
year veteran was on duty and
how it could have ended with a
bullet in the officer's chest.
Covarrubias' family wants
answers, too.
"What happened to proce-
dure?" asked his father, Alberto
Covarrubias Sr. "Why did they
go to arrest him in the field?
If it was so urgent why didn't
they just say there was a family
emergency and he had to come
to the station?"
Chief Danny R. Macagni
did not respond to repeated
requests for an interview, nor
did City Manager Rick Hayden
or City Attorney Gilbert Tru-
jillo.
At a news conference the
day after the shooting, neither
Macagni nor his top deputies
were wearing the black bands
across their badges that are
customary after an officer is
killed.
"Events unfolded very rapid-
ly," he said. "It was very clear to
the investigators that he knew
what was going to happen. I
cannot divulge why we know
that. The information that we
hail we knew we could not let
him get in the car and drive
somewhere.

PABLO MARTINEZ MONSIVAIS,
President Barack Obaina sits ina Chevrolet Silverado at the Washington Auto
Show yesterday.
Oama praises auto
industry's comeback

President tries out
cars at Washington
. Auto Show
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama hailed the
rebound of the U.S. auto indus-
try yesterday, trumpeting an
economic story he hopes to use
to his political advantage in key
Rust Belt states such as Michigan
and Ohio. In a not-so-veiled shot
at Republican presidential front-
runner Mitt Romney, Obama
said it was worth remembering
that there were some leaders
"willing to let this industry die."
Obama sat inside shiny new
plug-in electric hybrids and burly
trucks during a quick tour of the
Washington Auto Show, declar-
ing, "The U.S. auto industry is
back." Obama emphasized his
administration's rescue of Gen-
eral Motors and Chrysler from
the brink of collapse as Romney
was surging in Florida's GOP pri-
mary, a contest that could bring
him a step closer to winning the
Republican nomination.
The president did not men-
tion Romney by name, but told
reporters it was "good to remem-
ber the fact that there were some
folks who were willing to let this
industry die. Because of folks
coming together we are now
back at a place where we can
compete with any car company

in the world."
Romney spokeswoman
Andrea Saul said the former
Massachusetts governor was
"thrilled" to see the companies'
success but said it was "unfor-
tunate that the government first
attempted a bailout, which was
precisely as unsuccessful aq he
predicted, cost taxpayers bil-
lions, and left the government
improperly entangled in the pri-
vate sector."
For Obama, the auto bailout
has been a case study for his
efforts to revive the economy and
a potential point of contrast with
Romney, who opposed Obama's
decision to pour billions of dol-
lars into the auto companies. The
president's campaign views the
auto storyline as a potent argu-
ment against Romney, the son
of a Detroit auto executive who
later served as Michigan gover-
nor.
Indeed, the auto show tour
was just another example of
the White House taking every
opportunity to highlight its
efforts to rebuild the auto indus-
try, with aides frequently point-
ing to GM's reemergence as the
world's largest automaker and
job growth and profitability in
the U.S. auto industry.
. "The fact that GM is back, num-
ber one, I think shows the kind of
turnaround that's possible when it
comes to American manufactur-
ing," Obama said.

Keep the heat on
DTE shouldn't shut off utilities in winter
've had a mild winter this year - the 50-degree tempera-
tures in January are a testament to that. But that doesn't
mean that the'winter is bearable without heat and elec-
tricity. Thousands of Detroit families have had to suffer through the
cold because DTE Energy shut off lights and heat to 105,348 custom-
ers last year. While DTE is a profit seeking company, it still needs
to recognize basic human needs. Like all companies that perform
important utility services, DTE needs to do its part to help suffering
Michigan residents who can't afford utilities.


How important is Florida? Today it's the most
important thing in the world to me.
- Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov.
Mitt Romney on his victory in the Florida GOP primary last night:
Religion isn't going anywhere

Three hundred protesters took over the
lobby of DTE headquarters last Thurs-
day to protest these shut offs, chanting "no
more shut offs." Organizers included reli-
gious, labor and even Occupy leaders. The
protesters claimed that DTE was shutting
off electricity to houses while giving its
top executives salary increases. They also
accused DTE of not paying its share in taxes.
A DTE spokesman said the company was
doing all it could to keep the power on in
these tough economic times, but they didn't
address the accusation of salary increases.
Michigan law states that it's illegal to shut off
power between the months of November and
March, but thousands of people had utilities
cut in October, forcing them to deal with the
cold winter months.
Many Michigan residents, especially those
in Detroit, have suffered due to the economic
downturn. Detroit residents have few pros-
pects and little opportunity. The least DTE can
do is keep their houses warm. DTE supplies
services that keep people alive, and if these ser-
vices disappear, so will the people who depend
on them. DTE needs to have humane morals in
addition to its profit-making attitude.
While there are services for the poor to help
them pay their electric bills, there is still more
to be done. The Michigan Low Income and
Energy Efficiency Pund provides assistance to
low-income households to pay bills and keep

the electricity on. LIEFF is a much needed pro-
gram, but it's running out of money. Programs
like LIEEF are necessary, and Detroit should
work to create more programs to help the poor
in hard winter months.
DTE is a large company that can afford to
keep some families' lights and heat on in the
dead of winter. If it's true that it's giving sal-
ary increases to executives, then DTE needs
to rethink its business model. Giving its exec-
utives salary increases and bonuses doesn't
make sense if the company is unable to avoid
shut offs. All its extra money should be used
to keep electricity running for the most
amount of people possible. They shouldn't be
handing out money to people who don't need
it at the moment. Those who need electricity
should come first in something as important
as electricity and heat.
Despite the weather in recent weeks,
winters in Michigan are hard, and heat can
be the difference between life and death.
Detroit's residents are already struggling,
and not having electricity makes it even
worse. More programs like' LIEEF would
relieve Michigan residents' stress as they try
to make ends meet. DTE should work hard
to keep the power on. The salary increases
are not an efficient or moral use of money.
DTE provides a service that is crucial to life
in Michigan and it needs to put that above
everything else.

n places like Ann Arbor, I often
hear that religion is on the way
out. Scientific advances have
rendered super-
stition obsolete
- one doesn't
need to believe
in God to know
where the sun
goes at night.
I agree. I dis-
agree, though, SETH
with the idea SODERBORG
that religion will
therefore disap-
pear.
People raised outside of reli-
gious traditions tend to think that
religious beliefs are predicated on
well-known, obsolete ideas about
nature, like the idea that a specific
deity created the earth in exactly six
24-hour periods. That way of think-
ing obscures the primary motivation
of those who are religiously obser-
vant. People pray, meditate and go to
church to satisfy spiritual urges.
We ought to think of religion
and spirituality as different things.
Spirituality, in broad terms, is a
class of feelings and accompany-
ing actions. The feelings people call
"spiritual" tend to come in moments
of wonder, hope or longing. Beauti-
ful music, the sight of candles at a
vigil, and the thrill of standing atop
a mountain are all things that peo-
ple identify as spiritual. The sen-
sation that ties these experiences
together is a sense of unity - the
feeling of being part of something
greater than oneself, be it nature,
the sublime, or a human communi-
ty. The variety of things recognized
as spiritual - prayer, meditation,
ecstatic outbursts, singing - speaks
to the breadth of experiences that
generate the sensation of oneness.
Religions are communities built
around guidelines for how best to

experience and draw meaning from
spiritual feelings. Some religions
are dogmatic, providing compre-
hensive rules of ethical and spiri-
tual conduct. Other religions are
anti-dogmatic, emphasizing that
the many varieties of spiritual expe-
rience - and the ways of achieving
these experiences - are similarly
worthwhile. Just as the experience
of spirituality is infinitely varied,
so too are the ways in which people
have organized and interpreted
their spiritual experiences.
The varieties of religious prac-
tice reflect the many ways in which
humans experience spiritual sensa-
tions. Thus there are religious tradi-
tions that say the best life is solitary,
and time is best spent in the con-
tinuous contemplation of the divine.
Other religious traditions proscribe
the solitary life, declaring that unity
is best felt in the presence of others.
Science speaks to our understand-
ing of natural phenomena. Where
religion attempts to provide answers
to questions about nature, it is vul-
nerable to challenges from science.
Scientific inquiry has little to offer
in the field of ethics, and less still on
questions about extracting meaning
from life. A randomized controlled
trial is unlikely to shed light on why
we are here.
Naturalistic philosophy, which
is often informed by science, might
reject the question, "Why are we
here?" on the grounds that it pre-
supposes narrative reasoning to be
an underlying part of nature. This is
a reasonable position, but for many
people it is deeply unsatisfying. It is
in our nature to build narratives and
extract meaning. We aren't going to
stop asking "Why?" anytime soon.
It's important that those who
think about religion's role in society
recognize that natural phenomena
are only one aspect of what reli-

gion discusses. It's in our nature to
seek answers. It's also in our nature
- more in some of us than in oth-
ers - to experience spiritual feel-
ings. Spiritual practice organized as
religion provides answers to ques-
tions and explanations of sensations
that touch the deepest levels of the
human psyche. The choice to join a
religious community is often emo-
tional and deeply personal.
Spirituality is a
class of feelings
and actions.
Religion has always been a mani-
festation of the human desire to
understand - and derive meaning
from - the world in which we live.
That desire led to both scientific and
religious inquiry. So long as humans
desire to give meaning to their
lives, some will turn to religion and
spirituality for answers. The level

of attendance at specific religious
denominations will change over
time, and some religions will disap-
pear while others flourish. In the
distant future there maybe as many
Muslims or christians as there are
sun-worshipers today. We should
not mistake the end of religion as
we know it for the end of religion -
ways of organizing spirituality have
always changed with the times.
Churches come and go. Spiritual-
ity - and its counterpart, religion
- will endure.

Babysitting 101

The law exists for a reason, prisons exist
for a reason and that little box on job appli-
cations that convicted criminals must check
exists for a reason. Individuals who com-
mit such offenses should be held account-
able; permanently. It doesn't matter if their
motives were unintentional, if they were
minors at the time or if someone seemingly
forced them into such behavior. The bottom
line is once you're a convicted felon, that's
one strike that shouldn't be removed from
your record.
The Michigan Legislature should reject
the January proposal by the Fair Chance
Coalition - a group advocating for the
rights of convicted felons - to "ban the
box." Approving this legislation would
eliminate any criminal history information
from appearing on job applications, meaning
employers would be "blind" to an individual's
criminal past. Doing this would send a com-
pletely ridiculous message that any and all
crimes will essentially be overlooked in the
hiring process. Imagine the societal impact
that can result from crimes going unpun-
ished in the long run. It won't be pretty.
Americans all have the same civic duties
and responsibilities, and we must all follow
the same stringent rules and regulations as
established by our national government.
When an individual breaks these rules and is
convicted of a crime, they must face the con-
sequences - no matter what. One of those
consequences is facing disadvantages in the
workforce. Passing this legislation would
essentially grant convicted felons the same
opportunities and privileges as those who
abide by the law.
Imagine for a moment that you're an
employer. You're rifling through piles of job
applications. Wouldn't you want to know
if someone you're considering hiring has
robbed a bank or committed credit card fraud
in the past? I certainly would. What if you
had to choose between two individuals with

equally impressive skills and experience for
a position? Yet one of them could have com-
mitted murder five years ago. Withholding
information about criminal history on job
applications means there is a 50/50 chance
you end up hiring the murderer. They'll be a
great asset to your company. ,
It's commendable that convicted felons are
takinggreat steps to turn their lives around.
Seeking employment opportunities is exact-
ly what they should be doing, but employ-
ers deserve to know everything about their
potential employees, especially their crimi-
nal history. Crimes need to be reported on
an individual's record because they aren't
something to be ignored.
I realize that mistakes do happen, and
sometimes criminals are truly remorseful
for crimes they've previously committed.
Steps should be taken to improve the crimi-
nal history section of an application instead
of removing it all together. Convicted felons
should have a fair chance to explain them-
selves and their history in greater detail.
Perhaps providing more information on the
individual's rehabilitation or recovery stages
and an update on their current standing with
the law would help employers better assess
these individuals. Employers need more
information than just a simple answer when
evaluating convicted felons as potential
employees. But convicted felons shouldn't be
allowed to simply erase their past.
There are no excuses for breaking the law,
and convicted felons need to understand and
accept the consequences of doing so. These
individuals can't expect their wrongdoings
to just disappear. It's not practical and it's
not fair to those citizens who take their civic
responsibilities and morals more seriously.
Improvements can be made to allow these
lawbreakers a better shot at securing a job,
but one thing is certain: the box must stay.
Caroline Syms is an LSA sophomore.

At almost 22 years old, it's been a longtime since I've
been babysat - literally and figuratively. The fact that
my parents treated me like an adult in most ways years
before others probably adds to that, but the reality is
that I've been in charge of my own academic life since, at
least, the beginning of high school.
It seems like every time we moved up from school
to school - elementary to middle and middle to high -
teachers told us that at the new level we would be held
to a higher level of self-sufficiency. We were expected
to organize our own work and keep our own schedules.
Basically, they weren't going to baby us. From what I
remember, it never seemed to be true and I was frustrat-
ed that I was still being treated like a child - precocious
middle schooler that I was.
In college, though, it was finally true. We are in charge
of our own educations. No one approves our schedules
or academic plans, reminds us to do our homework and
reading, ensures that we get to our exams or makes sure
that we don't forget to do our papers.
This fact is why I'm so surprised that one of my pro-
fessors is-currently treating our class like children.
Personally, I think that as college students it's our own
responsibility to do the work and go to class. In a small,
discussion-based class it makes sense to take attendance.
Each student's presence and participation makes a dif-
ference in the class. In a 60-person lecture,.though, it
doesn't. It probably helps to go to class, but if I don't,
that's my own choice and I'll face the consequences.
The same goes for paying attention in class. Obviously
taking notes is a good idea. But it's on the student to do so.
It's most definitely not the professor's job to make sure I

attend lecture and pay attention. If I choose not to do the
work, then that's my business and I'm the one who will
have to deal with the ramifications. But I certainly don't
expect to be treated like a high schooler mere months
before my graduation.
This is exactly what is happening in this particular
class. The professor has threatened to banlaptops if any-
one is found doing something other than taking notes.
And attendance is taken before every lecture, for all 60
people in the class. We're required to attend and pay
attention.
Honestly, it's highly likely that I would do both of
these things most of the time. But the fact that I am
mandated to do so is a little annoying. And as a gener-
ally good student with good grades, I think I should be
trusted to figure it out for myself.
Frankly, I think it's a student's choice to go to class
and pay attention. If a student finds they can get by with-
out paying attention or attending class, they should be
able to use their time in a more productive way. We pay
enough in tuition that we should be allowed to choose
how to allocate our time. While class is usually my top
priority, sometimes other things like job searches and
writing my thesis take priority over paying attention for
the entire class or attending at all.
I think that by now, I'm old enough to make that deci-
sion for myself. Certainly no one is going to be making
that decision for me after this semester. These are the
sink or swim years, and professors who insist on babying
students aren't doing anyone a favor.

portions of their endowment in
energy is not uncommon. The
University of Texas, a school long
regarded for its connection to oil,
has 6 percent of its endowment
invested in energy related assets,
according to Bruce Zimmer-
man, University of Texas Invest-
ment Management Company
president. Ohio State University
has 8 percent of its endowment
invested in energy assets as well,
according to OSU spokesman Jim
Lynch.
LSA junior Maggie Oliver,
chair of the environmental issues
commission in Central Student
Government,.has been involved
with sustainability initiatives on
campus, most promjnently in the
push to eliminate the sale of plas-
tic water bottles on campus.
Oliver said that while she
wishes the University would
move more quickly in developing
sustainable efforts, she under-
stands paying for them with
funds that receive contributions
from energy investments. Oliver
herself received a scholarship
from Shell to attend Camp Davis,
a University operated teaching
and research center located near
Jackson, Wyoming, where she
studied geology.
"I do understand it for now,"
Oliver said. "Yes, we need the
world, we need the environment
but the society we live (in), it does
run on money, so there is that
aspect of it too ... I do know that
we have to meet in the middle at
some point and that's the only
way that real changes and sus-
tainable changes will take place."
Oliver added that she hopes the
University aims to become more
involved with alternative energy.
"The environment is always
kind of pushed aside but it should
be a priority," Oliver said. "Every-
thing does revolve around the
environment and we need to start
caring about it and (making) it
more important because it is
becoming more and more impor-
tant to people."
While the amount invested in
sustainability efforts is less than
the returnfrom theenergysector,
the University is making efforts
to add variety to the energy sec-
tor. At last month's regents meet-
ing, the board approved a $25
million investment in RK Mine
Finance, a company associated
with financing ore companies.

message that it's cool to know a
lot about everything, or know a
little about everything at least,"
Shi said.
Maggie Speak, contestant
producer for Jeopardy!, said the
application process for the show
has two components - an online
exam and an in-person test and
personality interview.
"All of the college students
have to take a 50-question online
test to qualify to be in the pool for
the in-person interview," Speak
said. "Out of that, every year, we
pick about two to three hundred
(students) for in-person auditions
... At the in-person auditions we
are test-givers, we give another
50-question test ... and then what
we do is we have the players play

ROMNEY
From Page 1A
Fla., Romney confidently cast
himself as the GOP's likely nomi-
nee. He said he was eager "to lead
this party and our party and our
nation," criticizing President
Barack Obama for a lack of lead-
ership.
"Mr. President, you were
elected to lead, you chose to fol-
low, and now it's time to get out
of the way," he said at the event.
Romney's victory in Florida, a
state worth 50 delegates at this
summer's Republican National
Convention, reestablishes his
prospects as the most electable
opponent to President Barack
Obama in November's gen-
eral election, according to LSA
junior Brian Koziara, external
vice chair of the University's
chapter of the College Republi-
cans, said.
About half of Florida voters
reported that electability was the
most important factor in their
decisions at the polls. Data shows
that Romney performed better
than Gingrich among elderly and
Tea Party voters, two metrics
Koziara said Gingrich dominated
in past primaries.
Koziara said the margin of vic-
tory alone, and as a rebound from
his loss in South Carolina a week
and a half ago, allowed Romney
to regain lost ground after Gin-
grich handily beat him there.
"If (Gingrich) would've gotten
Florida, that would've signaled
that he had a fair shot at possibly
challenging Romney on the nom-
ination," Koziara said. "The fact
now that Newt only has South

Carolina and Romney won big
in New Hampshire and Florida,
which are two states he's going
to need in the general election -
I think that's important." '
By failing to capitalize on his
South Carolina win, Gingrich
.may have missyd an opportunity
to maintain his staying power in
the race, Koziara said. Though
the former Speaker said in a
speech last night that he would
continue to campaign voracious-
ly in upcoming states, Koziara
said the fact that many of those
states are "Romney-friendly"
further jeopardized his chances
of earning the Republican nomi-
nation.
Koziara said he's confident
that Romneywill win Michigan,
adding that he believes Rom-
ney will likely need to wait until
Super Tuesday - when 11 states
hold their primaries on March 6
- to have a chance to lock up the
Republican nomination.
Michigan Republican Party
spokesman Matt Frendewey said
all of the candidates are expected
to campaign in Michigan, bar-
ring any candidates from drop-
ping outof the race - a possibility
Koziara said he did not expect of
any of the candidates, with the
exception of former Pennsylva-
nia Sen. Rick Santorum.
Frendewey said he is anxious-
ly awaiting the Michigan prima-
ry, because he expects the state's
Republican voters to come out in
force to knock out Obama out of
the White House.
"Michigan Republicans
are fired up," Frendewey said.
"They're ready for change.
They're tired of the failed poli-
cies of President Barack Obama."

He said the state's Republi-
can voters might be particularly
incensed by what he said were
the president's failed promises
on health care, the financial defi-
cit and the rising cost of higher
education.
University students expressed
mixed sentiments on their atten-
tion to the Republican contests,
though some said they would
watch the Michigan primary
at the end of the month, which
coincides with the University's
spring break.
LSA juniors Thomas Jones
and Lois Dodson said they were
following the race somewhat
closely, having watched a few of
the debates, though added they
would likely be more attentive
to the Michigan primary and the
general election.
Engineering sophomore Olivia
Nordquist agreed that she would
tune into the Michigan primary
at the end of the month. She said
she thought results of the prima-
ry might be telling in terms of the
state's transformation since the
last general election.
"Michigan will be a state that
matters because we have such a
strong Democratic base," Nor-
dquist said. "But right now we're
a Republicanstate. So I think my
vote will matter."
The next contest in the Repub-
lican race will be held in Nevada
on Feb. 4, followed by Maine,
Colorado, Missouri and Min-
nesota the following week. The
Michigan primary, along with
the primary in Arizona, will be
held on Feb. 28.

the long run, many of the things
that the students suggested and
that we agreed to invest in will

While the University funds

a mock-version of Jeopardy, just
like playing the game."
The mock game allows the
producers to get a sense of each
potential contestant's personal-
ity and to gauge how the contes-
tant will perform on the actual
show, according to Speak.
"We do a short personality
interview to get to know them
a little bit and that's kind of fun
for us too," Speak said. "They get
to talk about what their interests
are, what they hope to do when
they get out of school and what
they would do if they won the
$100,000."
There are no specific qualifi-
cations for College Champion-
ship contestants, except that they
must be full-time college under-
graduates and can't hold a previ-
ous bachelor's degree, Speak said.
"You don't have to be from An
Ivy League school to become a
.winner on Jeopardy," Speak said.
"That's just notthe way it works."
.Speak said it's contestants like
Shi that make her job worth-
while.
"I think sometimes we all get
a little downhearted about what
our future looks like and then
when you get to meet the kinds
of kids that are on the College
Championship for Jeopardy,
they're just really incredible,"
Speak said. "They care about
their future, they care about
other people and they give me
great hope for our future."

HEARING
From Page 1A
us to try to stop the hearing or at
least put it on hold until we can be
a party at this hearing, until we
can have our rights represented
at the meeting."
The motion questions MERC's
Dec. 13 decision to send the
GSRA's case to an administra-
tive judge, given the precedent of
a 1981 MERC ruling that stated
GSRAs are students, not public
employees.

Both Schuette and The
Mackinac Center Legal Foun-
dation - on behalf of SAGU -
filed appeals with the Michigan
Supreme Court.
Raiman said the hearing's
format is unfair because both
the University and GEO - the
parties who will be presenting
in front of the judge - agree
that GSRAs should be classified
as employees with the right to
organize.
Though Schuette, SAGU and
others opposed to unionization
will have an opportunity to sub-

mit evidence at the hearing, they
will not be allowed to challenge
evidence presented by GEO or
cross-examine witnesses called
by lawyers by the University or
GEO, according to Raiman.
Even if GEO proves successful
in the hearing, Raiman said his
group will continue fighting.
"If we don't get the result that
we hope ... then we'll have to
try our best to run a campaign
to win this election, to educate
GSRAs to see the hazards of
unionization and the costs of
unionization."


SAFETY
From Page 1A
ment,-Joe Piersante, interim exec-
utive director of the University's'
Department of Public Safety, and
Ann Arbor Police Chief Barnett
Jones to increase communica-
tion between the city and cam-
pus community about improving
safety efforts.
Jones said the organization
aims to determine how the city of
Ann Arbor and the University can
work together to improve safety
in the community, specifically by
garnering input from students.
"It's a collaborative University
and city effort to ask ourselves,
'How effective has this been?'
and what more could we be
doing," Jones said.
Jones added that the group
is a multi-faceted program that
brainstorms creative ways to
keep students safe.
"I'm hoping that this commit-
tee will come up with three or
more ideas of things we can do,"
Jones said. "Because we want to
continue to be responsive to the
needs and continue to do things
that are really relevant for stu-
dents."
Rider-Milkovich, chair of the
workgroup, noted that the group
- which has not yet had its first
meeting - will use the skills of a
diverse group of administrators
to devise new methods of safety
education.
"We think of this not only as
helping students stay safe while
they're on campus and while
they're part of the University of
Michigan community, but also
giving them skills that they can
move forward once they gradu-
ate," Rider-Milkovich said.
Rider-Milkovich said sexual
assault is only one type of crime
SAPAC works to prevent, adding
that she plans to use her exper-
tise in sexual assault prevention
to aid the group in preventing all
forms of crime.
"In my role as chair, I will be
helping the group to really focus
in on the spectrum of safety ini-
tiatives that are already in place
on campus and looking for ways
to enhance what we have and
really create the comprehensive
framework of safety education,"

Rider-Milkovich said.
Seto said he is involved in the
workgroup to demonstrate his
department's commitmentto stu-
dent safety.
"AAPD is there to pledge the
full support of the police depart-
ment in this initiative to improve
student safety," Setosaid. "Ithink
our other role is ... along with the
University of Michigan police
and the Dean of Students Office,
to collectively evaluate ideas that
may improve student safety and
see how we can implement those
in a collaborative effort."
Seto said though DPS and
AAPD already collaborate on a
regular basis, the workgroup may
help them improve their relation-
ship.
"I think this workgroup may
be a way for us to solicit other
ideas from other people that may
be in the workgroup so that we
can see how we can even improve
on that," Seto said.
In a statement to The Michi-
gan Daily on Monday, Piersante
said he hopes the group will aid
DPS in improving its current
efforts to educate students on
crime prevention.
"We support efforts to raise
awareness among our students
as to how they can contribute to
our community's safety, while
also reducing their personal
safety risk," Piersante said. "I
look forward to hearing recom-
mendations from the workgroup
regarding suggested enhance-
ments to our current efforts."
LSA junior Josh Buoy, a stu-
dent safety assistant in the Dean
of Students Office and a chair
of the Central Student Govern-
ment's Student Safety Commis-
sion; said the Beyond the Diag
program continues to serve as
a holistic approach to student
safety.
"It's definitely small steps
(leading) to a larger goal," Buoy
said.
Buoy said as a part of Beyond
the Diag, the division of student
affairs has been sending month-
ly e-newsletters to students liv-
ing off-campus with articles and
tips from the University Health
Service, the Department of Pub-
lic Safety and Counseling and
Psychological Services.
Beyond student safety, the

program also looks to increase
safety for all members of the Ann
Arbor community.
"The safety component is one
very important component of
what we're doing," he said. "But
equally important as the safety
component is the community
aspect as well."
Buoy said three neighborhood
ambassadors have been assigned
to create programs for students
in different neighborhoods to
encourage "neighborhood iden-
tity," adding that the ambassa-
dors will work with Ann Arbor
City Council members to estab-
lish associations within each
neighborhood.
Buoy said the program aims
to assure students that the Uni-
versity is still concerned for their
well-being even though they live
off-campus, and the organiza-
tion hopgs to continue to foster
a connection with students mov-
ing out of the residence halls
by distributing posters and fli-
ers with information about the
group.
Jones, who has continued to
pass out information and can-
vass neighborhoods as part of
the program, said the initiative's
focus on community involve-
ment ensures that students are
looking out for their neighbors,
adding that Beyond the Diag is
particularly conducive to com-
munity-oriented policing.
"They're better witnesses and
better prepared to invoke the
criminal justice system when
needed because they'll have
more information to give us,"
Jones said.
Laura Blake Jones, associate
vice president of student affairs
and dean of students, said Uni-
versity students have been at the
forefront of Beyond the Diag.
"We've been building the pro-
gram from the ground up and all
of it has been student initiated,"
Jones said.
Buoy and his fellow student
safety assistant, LSA junior
Stephanie Hamel, have been at
the core of the program, Jones
said, ensuring that students can
relate to the program's initia-
tives.
."We're trying to make what
goes on ... relevant to the off-
campus students," Jones said.

The final work of the show is
by guest choreographer Lucinda
Childs. The dance is set to the
music of the composer Philip
Glass. Sparling described this
piece as Minimalist and stark,
showing animage of lateral move-
ment as dancers flow across the
stage, exiting and entering in a
series of crossings.
"The reason we called it
'Dancelucent' was (due to) the
idea of light that runs through the
entire program - for my work it's
the light of video projection that
is cast on theddancers, for (DeY-
oung's) work, I think it's more
the light of feeling, the light that
grows dark and then glows like
red in a group of young people,"
Sparling said. "(Wilson's work)
is very much spiritual light of a
community. And then Lucinda
Childs's work is more the light of
pure physics, a kind of minimalist
palette of very pure abstraction, a
conceptual abstraction of light."
Sparling spoke of his final
wishes for the audience - clearly
reflecting the show's uplifting
theme of light - for when the
show has finished and the lights
have come on once again.
"I want them to go away feeling
exhilarated, feeling renewed with
the potential of humans to create
beautiful pictures in space," Spar-
ling said. "I want them to leave
exhilarated and I want them to
leave wanting to come back next
year."

North Korea's
new leader begins
nationwide tour

KHALIL HAMRA/Ap
Egyptian protesters carry a man who fell in the crowd during a rally outside the Parliament in Cairo, Egypt, yesterday. Egypt's newly elected lawmakers took aim at
the country's military rulers yesterda, accusing them of trampling on democratic norms and overstepping their powers.
Egypt's new parliamentary government
blasts military for authoritarian decrees

Tensions rise
between ruling
generals and
democratic regime
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's
Islamist-dominated parliament
flexed its newly acquired powers
yesterday, accusing the country's
military rulers of overstepping
their powers by imposing a new
presidential election law before
the legislators were even seated.
The law, which lays out the
rules for the vote expected later
this year, and other military
decrees are shaping up as a
litmus test of the relationship
between the new lawmakers and
the generals who took power
after former President Hosni
Mubarak stepped down nearly a
year ago.
Meanwhile, protesters clashed
with Muslim Brotherhood sup-
porters who were forming a
human shield outside the parlia-
ment in front of the barbed wires
and barricades already set up by
security forces: Youth activists
who led the massive street pro-
tests that led to Mubarak's ouster
have accused the Islamists of

ignoring their demands and sid-
ing with the military.
The fundamentalist Brother-
hood, which controls nearly half
of the seats in the 508-member
legislature, has won control of
11 out of the 19 specialized com-
mittees inside the parliament,
including the key defense and
national security committee
that would likely be in charge of
reviewing the military's budget
and other issues.
Protesters outside the parlia-
mentary building in downtown
Cairo chanted "You sold the
revolution," while others heckled
Brotherhood supporters leaving
the area. Dr. Mohammed Sultan,
head of the Egyptian ambulance
service, said 71 people were
injured, most from rocks that
were thrown, and 30 were hospi-
talized.
Many leftist and secular
activists fear the Brotherhood
might form an alliance with the
military to ensure it has influence
over the drafting of a constitu-
tion - a task that the parliament
will oversee.
Lawmakers, however, sought
to assert their authority yester-
day. Many accused the military of
trying to avoid public debate by
issuing the law before parliament

was convened on Jan. 23. The
law was published in the official
Egyptian Gazette and was not
publicly announced.
The law establishes new rules
for electing a president and has
a controversial provision that
rights groups allege would make
contesting the results before a
court of law impossible. The mili-
tary, which essentially rules by
decree, has on several occasions
made contradictory statements
about the extent of authority it
would allow a legislature one
general described as "not repre-
sentative."
Mohammed el-Beltagy, a
member of the Brotherhood's
Freedom and Justice Party, asked
parliament to review the law and
change it if necessary.
"Let it be a clear message to
the Egyptian street that the par-
liament has become the only and
unchallenged legislative author-
ity," el-Beltagy told lawmakers in
the nationally televised session.
Mostafa ElNaggar, a member
of el-Adl party that was formed
after the uprising, agreed.
"This is an early test. We
either decide if we will permit
any interference in our mission
or we won't," he said.
It remains tobe seen how the

parliament will handle the elec-
tion law. Some legislators called
for the military to repeal them.
Others said the review process
should be expedited, while
some suggested moving up the
presidential election date to avoid
further clashes with the military
rulers over authority.
Many lawmakers and activ-
ists have already demanded
that parliament review other
military decrees issued since
the generals took power last
February, including a law ban-
ning public protest and strikes,
as well as a decision to only par-
tially lift of the hated Mubarak-
era emergency laws.
The largely secular and urban
activist groups want an immedi-
ate end to military rule, and have
called for the army to return to
its barracks before a constitu-
tion be written and a president
elected.
"It is primarily a challenge
for the (Brotherhood) majority,"
said Hossam Bahgat, a human
rights lawyer. "If the Brother-
hood wants to send a message to
its constituency and the public at
large they are now an indepen-
dent and effective legislature,
they have no choice but to reopen
(discussion) of these decrees."

Kim Jong Un
visits military
installations first
SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
- North Korea's young new
leader gets rock star treatment
when he visits his troops - just
as his father did. But while the
late Kim Jong Il mostly stayed
aloof in dark shadles, his son
holds hands and hugs his sol-
diers:
Kim Jong Un seems to want to
bond with his country's people.
The style harkens back to Kim
Il Sung, his grandfather and
revered founder of the country
and ruling dynasty, and may
reflect an attempt to turn a cor-
ner on the periods of hardship
and famine under Kim Jong Il,
analysts say. Kim Ii Sung's image
as a daring young general fight-
ing Japanese colonial troops
is powerfully engraved in the
minds of North Koreans.
Cheers, applause and calls of
"Hurrah!" greet Kim Jong Un as
he examines the heating systems
of soldiers' quarters, the pres-
sure of their water faucets, the
books stacked in their libraries
- even the taste of their food.'
The North Korean state
media reports and video foot-
age of such "guidance visits"
provide rare windows into the
personalities of North Korea's
leaders for outsiders and for
the country's people alike. Few
North Koreans, for instance,
even knew what the elder Kim's
voice sounded like, analysts say,
despite his ruling for 17 years
until his death Dec. 17.
In visits made so far by Kim
Jong Un, believed to be in his
late 20s, North Korea special-
ists have detected more warmth
in his approach than the dour
tours made in recent years by

Kim Jong11.
The younger Kim maybe try-
ing to emulate Kim Il Sung and
move away from his father, who
ruled during a famine in the
mid- to late-1990s that killed
hundreds of thousands, said
Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea
professor at Seoul's Dongguk
University. North Korea also
has faced international condem-
nation and sanctions for its pur-
suit of nuclear weapons.
"He'll try to look comfort-
able among the masses. He'll try
to form an intimacy with the
people, perhaps more than his
father did," Koh said.
Imitating Kim Ii Sung is
a "positive for Kim Jong Un,
because memories of his father
Kim Jong Il aren't very good
among ordinary people," Koh
said. "People fondly remember
the days of Kim Il Sung."
Kim Il Sung often was pic-
tured surrounded by children,
and Kim Jong Un resurrected
that image during a recent visit
to the Mangyongdae Revolu-
tionarySchool.
As children in military uni-
forms cheered and clapped,
a documentary on state TV
showed Kim embracing one
child's face with his hands. Dur-
ing lunch, Kim patted students
in encouragement and watched
with a grin as two women
ladled out soup for students; he
poured a drop of spuce on his
thumb so he could taste it.
His main emphasis, however,
has been on military posts -
with seven such reported visits
since the New Year. They seek
to show citizens that their new
leader is firmly in command of
the country's most important
institution, its 1.2 million-
strong military, and that he is
loved and respected by young
troops and elderly generals
alike.

Amazonian Indians struggle in face of encroachment

Bow and arrow
attacks unnerve
local officials
LIMA, Peru (AP) - Peru-
vian authorities say they are
struggling to keep outsiders
away from a clan of previously
isolated Amazon Indians who
began appearing on the banks of
a jungle river popular with envi-
ronmental tourists last year.
The behavior of the small
group of Mashco-Piro Indians
has puzzled scientists, who
say it may be related to the
encroachment of loggers and by
low-flying aircraft from nearby
natural gas and oil exploration
in the southeastern region of the
country.
Clan members have been
blamed for two bow-and-arrow
attacks on people near the riv-
erbank in Madre de Dios state
where officials say the Indians
were first seen last May.
one badly wounded a forest
ranger in October. The following
month, another fatally pierced
the heart of a local Matsiguenka
Indian, Nicolas "Shaco" Flores,
who had long maintained a rela-
tionship with the Mashco-Piro.
The advocacy group Survival
International released photos
Tuesday showing clan members
on the riverbank, describing the
pictures as the "most detailed
sightings of uncontacted Indi-
ans ever recorded on camera."
The British-based group
provided the photos exactly a
year after releasing aerial pho-
tos from Brazil of another tribe
classified as uncontacted, one
of about 100 such groups it says
exist around the world.
one of the Mashco-Piro pho-
tos was taken by a bird watcher
in August, Survival Internation-
al said. The other two were shot
by Spanish archaeologist Diego

Cortijo on Nov. 16, six days
before Flores was killed.
Cortijo, a member of the
Spanish Geographical Society,
was visiting Flores while on an
expedition in search of petro-
glyphs and said clan members
appeared across the river from
Flores' house, calling for him by
name.
Flores could communicate
with the Mashco-Piro because
he spoke two related dialects,
said Cortijo, who added that
Flores had previously provided
clan members with machetes
and cooking pots.
The Mashco-Piro tribe is
believed to number in the hun-
dreds and lives in the Manu
National Park that borders
Diamante, a community of more
than 200 people where Flores
lived.
Although it's not known what
provoked the Mashco-Piro clan
to leave the relative safety of
their tribe's jungle home, Bea-
triz Huerta, an anthropologist
who works with Peru's agency
for indigenous affairs, specu-
lated their habitat is becoming
increasingly less isolated.
The upper Madre de Dios
region where the tribe lives
has been affected by logging,
she said. "They are removing
wood very close."
Meanwhile, Huerta said,
naturalists in the area and
Manu National Park officials
told her during a recent visit
that a rise in air traffic related
to natural gas and oil explora-
tion in the region is adversely
affecting native hunting
grounds, forcing increasing
migration by nomadic tribes.
The clan that showed up at
the river is believed to num-
ber about 60, including some
25 adults, said Carlos Soria, a
professor at Lima's Catholic
University who ran Peru's park
protection agency last year.

"It seemed like they wanted
to draw a bit of attention, which
is a bit strange because I know
that on other occasions they had
attacked people," Cortijo said by
phone from Spain. "It seemed
they didn't want us to go near
them, butI also know that the
only thing that they wanted was
machetes and cooking pots."
Cortijo said the group lingered
by the river a few minutes, appar-
ently to see if a boat would pass
by so they could ask for some
tools, something authorities say
they had done in the past.
"The place where they are seen
is one of heavy transit" of river
cargo and tourist passage, and
so the potential for more violent
encounters remains high, Soria
said.
That is compounded by cul-
ture clash. The Mashco-Piro
live by their own social code,
which Soria said includes the

practice of kidnapping other
tribes' women and children.
He said the Mashco-Piro are
one of about 15 "uncontacted"
tribes in Peru that together are
estimated to number between
12,000 and 15,000 people living
in jungles east of the Andes.
"The situation is incredibly
delicate," said Huerta, the gov-
ernment anthropologist.
"It's very clear that they don't
want people there," she said
of the area where the clan has
been loitering, noting that it had
ransacked a jungle ranger's post
that authorities later removed.
One of the clan's likely fears
is being decimated by disease
borne by outsiders, as has
occurred with other uncontact-
ed peoples, Huerta said.
But its also a mystery why
they have appeared in an
area so heavily trafficked, she
added.

Attack targets
school and car in
targeted raid
SANAA, Yemen (AP) - U.S.
airstrikes targeting leaders from
Yemen's active al-Qaida branch
killed four suspected militants,
including a man suspected of
involvement in the 2000 bomb-
ing of the USS Cole, officials said
yesterday.
Missiles st'ruck a school and a
car late Monday in the southern
Abyan province, Yemeni security
and military officials said. Large
swaths of the province have fall-
en under the influence of al-Qaida
as the militants exploit a security
vacuum stemming from an upris-
ing against President Ali Abdul-
lah Saleh that began last year.
The U.S. considers the Yemen
branch of al-Qaida to be one
of the most dangerous arms of
the terrorist group. U.S. air-
craft hsve targeted al-Qaida

leaders there before, notably
killing Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.
citizen, lastyear. The U.S. rarely
comments on its air activity in
Yemen.
Al-Qaida inYemen has been
linked to several attacks target-
ing the U.S., includingthatby
the "underwear bomber" who
tried to bring down an airliner
over Detroit on Christmas two
years ago.
Tribal officials in the area said
the latest strike hit the militants
as they were holding an impor-
tant meeting at the school. Air
strikes also hit targets in the sur-
rounding mountains and a car
carrying people to the meeting
between the towns of Lauder
and Moudia. Another car on its
way to the meeting got away, the
officials said.
Yemeni security officials
originally put the death toll at
15 people but later lowered that
figure to four. They also said 12
militants were wounded in the
strikes.

Blue seeks revenge vs. Indiana

By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Editor
March is just a month away,
which means one thing: the hunt
for a Big Ten title is on.
On Wednesday night, Michi-
gan welcomes Indiana to Crisler
Center to open

Though the 20th-ranked Hoo-
siers (5-5 Big Ten, 17-5 overall)
will bring a poised offensive
attack to Ann Arbor, Michigan
coach John Beilein is happy to
return to Ann Arbor following a
grueling three-game road stint.
His squad fell at Arkansas in a
nonconference heartbreaker, won
on the road for the first time this
season at Purdue and got flattened
at Ohio State.
Crisler has been kind to No. 23
Michigan (6-3, 16-6), as the Wol-
verines are 12-0 at home so far
this season. Beilein has repeatedly
stressed the importance of pro-
tectinghome court, and the coach-
ing staff has worked hard to instill
a resilient attitude in its players
followingthe recentroad losses.
"I was very happy (with) how
receptive we were yesterday to a
very instructive film session and
just talk about where we are right
now and what we could do best to
improve," Beilein said on Tuesday.
"We're coaching their brains a lot
... about what it takes to be win-
ners.
"There's a lot of courage
involved, and a lot of toughness
involved, and there's a lot of intel-
ligence involved in it. And if they
put that all together, how could
they be anything but resilient?"
But predicting a convincing
bounce-back performance for
Wednesday night is difficult,
as nobody seems to have a tight

grasp on what Indiana coach Tom
Crean's Hoosiers are capable of
Indiana has a pair marquee
wins under its belt, toppling
potential NCAA Tournament No.
1 seeds Kentucky and Ohio State
earlier this season. But the Hoo-
siers haven't done much outside
the cozy confines of Blooming-
ton's Assembly Hall, notchingjust
one conference road win against
bottom-dweller Penn State.
Beilein's squad, which has only
won one conference road game
itself, has tremendous respect for
the Hoosier offense, which tallied
a season-high 103 points on Sun-
day against Iowa.
"You think we have some guys
who could shoot at times - those
guys can shoot from the locker
room," Beilein said. "And you have
to be with them when they walk
out of the locker room. (Senior
forward Matt) Roth is incredible.
I think he could shoot from half
court as well as some guys can
shoot from the line."
Indeed, in the Wolverines'
73-71 loss at Assembly Hall on
Jan. 5, the Hoosiers were an effi-
cient 7-for-11 from behind the arc.
As a team, they currently lead the
Big Ten in 3-point shooting at a
44-percent clip.

Led by the sharp-shooting
Christian Watford, who lit up
Michigan for a game-high 25
points on Jan. 5, Indiana tends
to be very wise about its shot
selection. The Hoosiers rank just
eighth in the league in 3-point
attempts (the Wolverines are first
in that category by a long shot).
To help defend the perimeter,
Beilein will deploy senior guard
and co-captain Stu Douglass in the
starting lineup in place of sopho-
more forward Evan Smotrycz - a
lineup he's gone with for the last
four games. Douglass is consid-
ered the best perimeter defender
Michigan's roster has to offer.
"I like the defense that we can
come out with," Beilein said. "I
like how the matchups, we can
turn them in our favor. I think we
got off to pretty good starts in all
the situations that we started this
(lineup), except Arkansas."
On Jan. 5, Michigan did not get
off to a great start with Smotrycz
in the starting five, and the team
wound up fighting from behind
for the entire first half and some
of the second as well.
"That was bad," Beilein said.
"We got off to a bad start, and
we just had trouble. Watford is
just having a fantastic year ...

and you've got to get to them in a
hurry."
Douglass and senior cohort
and co-captain Zack Novak -
who both call the Hoosier State
home - will look to lock down the
shooters and secure a win against
Indiana in their last regular-sea-
son opportunity to do so.
And they'll likely need help
underneath from redshirt sopho-
more center Jordan Morgan, who
will be tasked with slowing down
freshman sensation Cody Zeller.
The 6-foot-11 force has found a
groove as of late, erupting for
26 points including seven dunks
against Iowa on Sunday.
Morgan will need to avoid the
foul trouble he ran into at Ohio
State over the weekend in order
to maximize his minutes, as the
Wolverine frontcourt continues
to struggle with its depth in the
absence of sophomore forward
Jon Horford (out with a foot inju-
ry since mid-December).
Beilein revealed Tuesday there
still has not been a final decision
on whether or not he will burn
Horford's redshirt before season's
end. But for now, as Michigan hits
the stretch, it appears that Mor-
gan will have to control the paint
with little help.

On women's basketball: Long-,
term issues from long range

Di Giuseppe focused on defense
By EVERETT COOK
Doily Sports Editor

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
With one shot against Wis-
consin on Monday, senior guard
CarmenReynolds sunkher 183rd
career 3-pointer, becoming the
all-time leader in that category
for the Michigan women's bas-
ketball team. She also reached
the 1,000-point milestone on
Dec. 30 against Illinois.
Both of these feats speak vol-
umes about how successful a
career Reynolds has had. But
this season, Reynolds, among
other Wolverines, has been
struggling from behind the arc.
Prior to this season, Reyn-
olds was a career 38.3-percent
3-point shooter. This season,
she's averaging a mere 25 per-
cent from deep. But Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth has main-
tained his faith in the senior.
guard since her dry spell became
a season-long shooting struggle.
"It's just a matter of her get-
ting enough shots," Borseth
said following a Dec. 13 loss to
Eastern Michigan. "If she gets
enough shots, she will make
them. She is a good shooter, she
is a money shooter. She is dne of
those kids that are going to make
it when she shoots it. That is a
confidence we all have in her."
And why wouldn't he have
confidence in her? She's a three-
year starter, averaged 13.1 and
10 points per game during her
sophomore and junior cam-
paigns, and was recruited by
Borseth primarily as a shooter.
But it's not only Reynolds
that Borseth has faith in from
behind the arc. Almost every
single player on the Wolverine
roster seems to have the green
light from 3-point territory, even
though the team has consistent-
ly struggled to score from deep.

Phil Di Giuseppe had a heck of
a first semester in Ann Arbor.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
predicted that Di Giuseppe would
be an immediate impact player,
and the freshman forward wast-
ed no time affirming his coach's
insight. He scored three goals in
his first four games and finished
November tied for the team lead
in goals.
In December, he was invited to
try out for the Canadian Junior
national team, a significant
accomplishment even though he
didn't make the team.
Notbad for an 18-year-old.
But the second semester for Di
Giuseppe has been rather differ-
ent. He hasn't scored a goal since
Dec. 3 in Alaska, and it took him
six games in 2012 to even register
a point.
"I'm not shooting as much as
before, and you have to shoot to be
lucky," Di Giuseppe said.
But defensively, the kid is com-
ing along just fine.
"(Berenson) told me I had
to work on my defensive game
when I came in here, and I think
I've done that," Di Giuseppe said.
"After Christmas break, I haven't
been scoring as much, so I have
been trying to help out defensive-
ly. I'm just happy to contribute
that way."
Berenson constantly stresses
the importance of two-way for-
wards, and more often than not,
the staple of Berenson's teams is
defensive stalwarts that fly after
loose pucks and aren't afraid to
get physical in the defensive zone..
Veteran players such as senior
captain Luke Glendening have
taken years to perfect that style of
play, because it's something that's
tough to pick up quickly. One of
the most difficult adjustments for
young players is defense, because
playing defense in prep leagues
is a lot different than playing
defense for Michigan.

ALDEN REISS/Daily
Freshman forward Phil Di Giuseppe hasn't produced offensively in 2012.

"Everyone can play offense,"
said junior forward Chris Brown.
"My dad always used to joke that
you can turn a defenseman into
a forward, but turning a forward
into a defenseman is goingto take
some time.
"Everyone wants to score goals
and be that guy in the limelight.
Defense is harder. It takes more
work, more effort, and it's more
tiring. On offense, you kind of get
to slow it down."
Di Giuseppe's defense has
improved naturally by play-
ing with Glendening, one of the
team's best defensive forwards,
and hard-working junior forward
A.J. Treais. But he is also learning
what many before him have been
taught - good defense will bring
good offense.
"You have to play better with-
out the puck when you aren't
scoring," Berenson said. "Not
that you intentionally do that, but
sometimes yougetcaughtup in an
offensive mindset and start think-
ing about goals and so on, but I
want them to think about check-
ing and working hard without the
puck.
"Then, the offensive stuff will
come. Our team always scores
more goals when we play better

defense."
Oftentimes, when players who
used to be their prep teams' lead-
ing scorers come to Michigan, too
much of their focus is paid to the
almighty stat sheet. To become
good on the defensive end, you
have to stop caring about seeing
your name in the box score. Men-
tally, thatcan be thebiggestbattle
of them all.
"You can't measure everything
in goals and assists, which a lot
of kids do before they get here,"
Berenson said. "They measure
their game as points,buthere, you
have to be a complete player, not
just a playerthat's hoping to score.
"That's the one thing you want
to become when you are Michi-
gan, you want to be a complete
hockey player when it is all said
and done."
Di Giuseppe registered his first
point of the new year in Michi-
gan's most recent game, an assist
against Notre Dame. But if the
freshman continues to improve
on defense, seeing his name inthe
stat sheet won't be important.
"I just have to play a more sim-
ple game offensively and do the
little things," Di Giuseppe said
"But if we keep winning, it doesn't
matter."

Food for the Soule
dreds of names accompanied by the smell of
SBelgian waffles greet me as I walk through
the door of 722 Soule Blvd After writing my
name on a scrap of masking tape, I walk into
the kitchen to a mix of people gathered around
various tables. On the menu: blueberry Bel-
gian waffles, mincemeat pierogies and winter
vegetable coulibiac. Through my camera lens
I'm able to listen in on small conversations and
r gain access to the front lines of the kitchen.
Not only do I observe how to properly make a
waffle, but learn about three different lesson
plans from a group of Spanish GSIs. And that's
exactly what the Selma Cafe is, an eclectic and
mismatched group - just like the varied sil-
verware and coffee mugs on which its food is
served. But it all works. It all comes together.
- An hour and a half later I place my own name
tag on the wall near the coat rack and walk out,
glad to have discovered another one of Ann
Arbor's specialties.

- James Perry

What do you think about Teach
for America?
I think it's a great opportunity for
students who want to get involved
with teaching or any sort of social
issues, and it's a great combination
of getting hands-on experience
while also getting a Master's in
teaching.
Would you yourself ever want to
be a teacher?
No, I hate kids.
So you don't want kids when
you're older?
I want kids, but I'll like my kids. I
don't want to take care of other
people's annoying kids. I have no
affiliation with that.
Do you have any younger siblings
or cousins?
I have two younger cousins, both of
which I do not talk to and are overly
academic and nerdy. But they think
I'm really cool, which is fun but
annoying.
What do you do on Saturdays
now that there aren't any foot-
ball games?
Work. But I'm lazy so I sit on my
couch until it's time to go out again.
I still eatthe same amount of food
that I would on a Saturday if I was
drunk though.

Kill me now.
' What's the
definition of a
date? My mom
took me out
once over
break and we
went shop-
ping and had
lunch.
How about the last time you went
out and chatted with a boy?
I went to Rush Street last week and
chatted with a creepy MBA who
was eight times my age and was
way too interested in my personal
life.
Ick. I hate when that happens.
But then again, I'm doing the
same thing - as in, being way too
interested in your personal life.
Are you active on campus?
I go to the Business School and
back.
What about the facilities there?
I sometimes go to the gym and
use the Stepper because you get
an escalated view of everyone, and
there's some good looking MBAs
but then.I get sweaty and then I get
creepy and I always see some of my
teachers there.
Who knows - maybe one of them
will be at Rush Street. That's
really awkward to be working
out next to your teachers. Do
they flex and stuff?
FW -C (

Yes, my one teacher from last year
is so intense. He's there for hours.
Do you like energy drinks?
Yeah, I like to feel that I'm being
productive and doing something
with my life when I'm on them, but
really, I just feel like I'm on crack.
That's why energy drinks are
notoriously bad for you. Got any
favorites?
Red Bull. Sugar-free. Gotta keep it
classy and low carb.
Let's talk about Obama coming
to the University. Did you wait in
line last week? -
I didn't. I just
called my dad and
t' asked if I could
pay $200 for a
ticket, but he said
that "you don't
care that much"
and "that's what
TVs are for."
Whywouldyouhavetopay$200?
Because people who waited in line
were selling them. My dad said I
should've been one of those people
who did that, like how I sold my
football tickets.
People camped out that night.
It sounds like the worst thing ever.
It would've been cool to see Obama
speak about things most of us don't
know about though.
If you had to choose between
being a teacher for a day or
camping out for Obama, which
would you choose?
Camping out for Obama, because
at least I could get drunk and enjoy
the experience with my friends.

Lisa Gottlieb and Jeff McCabe do not
have wallpaper in their mudroom.
Instead, tiny strips of masking tape
bearing the names of Selma Cafe regulars
in Sharpie cover every inch of drywall,
some name tags even creeping up onto the
ceiling. Robin's egg blue and pastel yellow
paint is barely visible underneath the piec-
es of peeling tape.
It's eight o'clock in the morning and the
cafe has been open for almost two hours,
but Gottlieb is bounding with a frenetic
energy, reciprocated equally by the dozens
of diners filtering through her doors.
She has never considered hosting break-
fast at Selma Cafe in anywhere else but her
home.
"Eating more locally
can make measurable
change. And it's also a
really healthy way to
eat because we're start-
ing with fresh, simple,
healthy ingredients."
-Lisa Gottlieb, owner of Selma
Cafe
On six days of the week, Gottlieb and
McCabe's quiet, unassuming house on
Ann Arbor's west side resembles any other
home. Only on Friday mornings does the
'quaint suburban setting transform into
Selma Cafe, a makeshift bistro serving
up locally grown meals on a by-donation
basis. Each week, Gottlieb and McCabe
invite one-local chef to their home to cook

breakfast for the customers, donating the
majority of the proceeds derived from that
morning toward a local cause.
In its nearly three years of existence,
the cafe has spread in popularity by word
of mouth. Gottlieb said it has fed as many
as 210 people within a three-and-a-half
hour time frame.
Perhaps the cafd's appeal derives from
its remarkably cozy atmosphere. Diners
are found anywhere from the dining room
table to the kitchen to the sofa, deftly bal-
ancing plates on their knees.
"My goal is that I want someone to come
to Selma Cafe and feel (as though) they've
been invited into our home for breakfast."
Gottlieb said.
Despite its low-key surroundings, Selma
Cafe dishes up some of the highest-quality
cuisine imaginable. The morning I visited
the breakfast salon, chef Dan Vernia of The
Ravens Club served traditional mincemeat
pierogies and winter vegetable coulibiac.
The menu's presentation seems to con-
tradict its elegance, as it's merely hand-
written in permanent marker and tacked
to a wall in the dining room. Nevertheless,
it is the food that serves as the forefront of
every breakfast. Each week at Selma Cafe
offers a new assortment of culinary dishes
one wouldn't find anywhere else.
"Eating more locally can make measur-
able change," Gottlieb said. "And it's also
a really healthy way to eat because we're

starting with fresh, simple, healthy ingre-
dients."
The variety of options has brought LSA
senior Jodi Solway to Gottlieb and McCabe's
home more times than she can count.
"It's great food and a great experience,"
Solway said. "It's a great way to start your
day, especially on a Friday."
Noticeably missing from the truly gour-
met menu is the expected hefty price tag.
Selma Cafe operates on.a by-donation basis
and Gottlieb said that the average dona-
tion is between $10 and $15 a person. A
typical breakfast at Selma, Gottlieb said,
could raise up to $1500.
One-third of this money is used to buy
fresh, high-quality ingredients from local
farmers that Ann Arbor's best chefs use
to create that Friday's fare. The rest of the
funds are allocated as micro-loans to local
farmers to buy hoop house kits, another
integral part of Selma Cafe's mission.
Hoop houses allow farmers to grow
food during all four seasons, extending
the growing season exponentially and
greatly increasing the availability of local
produce. Selma Cafe volunteers install the
hoop houses, keeping the cost minimal to
farmers.
So far, Selma Caf6 profits have helped to
build 30 hoop houses in the surrounding
community, with four built in Detroit.
"We want to buy local (and) I love the
variety and the creativity in local food,"

Gottlieb said. "We want to keep farmers in
business."
This initiative is one of the major rea-
sons Matt Merrins, a long-time volunteer
with Selma Cafe, continues to dedicate his
time to the organization.
Merrins, who everybody at Selma calls
"Scooter," said much of his passion for the
organization was strengthened by Selma's
efforts to aid local farmers. Merrins said
he first-came to help a friend poach 100
eggs for a Friday morning breakfast in
March 2009 and has been coming back
ever since.
"Its great food and a
great experience. It's
a great way to start
your day, especially on
Friday."
-LSA senior Jodi Solway
Selma Cafe started as a party in its earli-
est days. The whole idea of a locally grown
cafe got started when Gottlieb threw a
breakfast party to celebrate McCabe's 50th
birthday in Feb. 2009. From the party, she
said a "core group of people" who wished
to continue the tradition developed.
It's an unlikely start to an extraordi-
narily unique nonprofit organization, one
that has fed thousands of Ann Arbor locals
and assisted a number of local farmers.
But sitting on Gottlieb's living room
couch, surrounded by family photos and
paperback books, it's possible to forget
you're even part of a working nonprofit.
It feels, just as Gottlieb had hoped, like
you've stepped inside her home, invited as
an old friend.

DETROIT
From Page 4B
Academy High School, a TFA partner school
in the city that already has a graduation rate
above 90 percent, principal Danielle Jack-
son said the corps members are positively
impacting student learning.
"They've been able to do very well and
grow as young teachers," Jackson said.
In an interview on Jan. 19, Wendy Kopp,
founder and CEO of Teach for America, said
while it's not ideal to have TFA members in
mostly charter schools, TFA will work to
place its members in more traditional public
schools.

From Page SB
new job at a high school.
But not all corps members felt unprepared.
University alum Joel Berger, a current
2010 Detroit corps member, said while he felt
nervous about entering a new job, he could
not imagine better preparation.
"I feel like I was as prepared as I could have
been going into that first week," Berger said.
During her talk at the University, Kopp
further defended the criticism about corps
members' inexperience, lauding their lead-
ership against the experience of traditional
teachers.
"I really question the theory out there that
the answer to this problem is to recruit vet-
eran teachers in high income communities,"
Kopp said. "I just think there are alot of mis-
conceptions out there."
Entering the classrooms
Once in the schools, some corps members
struggled under what they felt was a lack of
support from Teach for America.
Dobbs said he felt he wasn't getting sup-
port from TFA after his first year because his
students weren't meeting the standardized
test results expected by the program.
"They focused on that test result and less
on that teacher as a human being," he said.
Dobbs said he also felt pressure under the
program's tenet of "pursue relentlessly," one
of the program's six principles of leadership,
to work around the clock for his classroom.
"I believe the word 'Orwellian' comes to
mind," Dobbs said. "I can't help but think
of reading '1984,' and all of the slogans and
group speech."
During her speech at the University, Kopp
acknowledged that corps members some-
times get lost in the bureaucracy of TFA. It's
something she said she wished she had re-
evaluated before the program expanded five
years ago.
"I think we have lots of systems and
lots of metrics and lots of goals and lots of
accountability at Teach for America and
(we've) invested a lot in that, and it took us

"I think the situation in Detroit, given the
economic constraints, budget constraints,
fiscal issues in the district, has, in the past,
prevented us from placing a lot of people in
DPS," Kopp said. "That being said, that will
change. --
"Given how Detroit is progressing, we
could be placing hundreds of people in the
highest-need schools," she added.
Brown attributes the prevalence of TFA
members in charter schools to the increas-
ing number of charter schools in the city.
"When we came in, we made a conscious
effort to really think about how we would
partner with both charters and DPS,"
Brown said. "Just because charters serve
so many of our kids, and kids keep going to

charters every year as DPS' enrollmentgoes
down."
The problem with public schools
Johnson filed a class action grievance
against the Detroit Public School District on
Sept. 28 for placing TFA members in posi-
tions that laid-off teachers were capable of
filling, according to the DFT website.
Johnson and the teachers union only have
jurisdiction over traditional public schools
and the 14 Detroit charter schools currently
authorized by DPS, so they can't contest hir-
ing practices at other charter schools in the
city.

America to come into Detroit Public Schools
is if there is a shortage of teachers in that
affected area, like math, like science, like
foreign language," Johnson said.
At all other times, Johnson said he doesn't
want to see TFA teachers in the schools.
"I do not intend to ever have Teach for
America as a stand-in within Detroit public
schools and the DFT," he added.
However, Brown contests the idea that
TFA teachers are taking jobs from school
teachers, as TFA members are the last to
go through the same interview process to
allow professional teachers priority access.
"We're not taking jobs," Brown said. "We
just set a great group of folks in front of
principals and ask them to decide."


far forward, but I think I would rebalance-
the energy that has gone around that," Kopp
said, addingthat she would have invested the
energy in "culture building" instead.
In Louisiana, Rickard was the only foreign
language teacher ina school newlytaken over
by the state. The lack of support was one of
the reasons she said she left the school and
TFA after two months.
"There was very, very little support both
from my school and from TFA in south Loui-
siana," Rickard said.
Rickard added that she was told in training
not to tell other teachers that she with TFA
because some teachers looked down on the
program for having only a two-year commit-
ment.
"One thing that they advised us pretty
early on was not to advertise the fact that we
were here with TFA," Rickard said.
University alum Brittany Turner, a 2010
Los Angeles corps member, also said she felt
that other teachers thought of her and other
corps members differently because of their
membership in TFA.
"Other teachers had a stigma against us
because we were Teach for America," Turner
said. "That definitely happened."
Berger added that the initial training he
received wasn't the extent of his own learn-
ing.
"I get ongoing support even now from
Teach for America that I consider sort of my
introduction into teaching," Berger said.
Two years to teach: beneficial
orjust a "pit stop?"
While TFA says it's committed to reshap-
ing education, some question the program's
level of commitment because each TFA corps
member is only bound to a two-year teaching
tenure.
In Detroit, Johnson said he feels the two-
year commitment doesn't help the schools, as
TFA teachers are not tied to the profession.
"They come here to just do two years,
to have something to put on their resume,"
Johnson said. "Then they go on to their real
careers. We need people who want to make
teaching a career, not a pit stop."
Kopp said in an interview after her speech

Q&A with the director followed the film.

that TFA was designed as a two-year pro-
gram so it could attract college seniors while
remaining competitive with other corpora-
tions and organizations that also ask for two-
year commitments.
"College seniors think two years is the rest
of their life," Kopp said. "And we see that if
we even move to a three-year commitment,
our applicant pool would drop in half."
She added that out of 24,000 TFA alums,
two thirds are still working in education,
either in the classroom or as administrators.
For Turner, the Los Angeles corps mem-
ber, the length of commitment was part of
the attraction.
"I thought Teach for America was a great
thing to do in between college and law
school," said Turner, who is now deciding

between attendinglaw school and continuing
to work for TFA.
Others, like Berger, say they're now seri-
ously consideringteaching professionally.
"I'm really committed to being a teacher
for more than two years," Berger said. "I real-
ly want to get good at it."
Though Dobbs has completed the Teach
for America program, he still teaches at an
elementary school in Virginia. While he had
problems with the program, he says its two-
year commitment is not a problem in the face
of larger educational issues.
"The rate of turnover is so high that part of
Teach for America's mandate is to put highly
motivated - to some extent brainwashed -
teachers in the classroom who are going to
work hard, and at the very least, be there."

Patterson said.

In Detroit, Teach for America corps
members have a chance to make an
impact on one of the country's most
disadvantaged school districts.
The school district is in such finan-
cial disrepair that last May Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder appointed an emer-
gency manager, Roy Roberts, to over-
see the school district's use of funds.
Despite the lack of resources,
Detroit schools that choose to partner
with Teach for America pay the orga-
nization an average of $3,000 for each
TFA corps member employed, in addi-
tion to paying corps members a start-
ing teacher's salary.
TFA spokesperson Rebecca Neale
wrote in an e-mail interview that TFA
uses the $3,000 in Detroit to cover the
program's recruitment, its training
program and to support its teachers.
Nationally, schools partnered with
Teach for America paid an average of
$2,700 per corps member employed
last year, according to Neale.
Keith Johnson, the head of the
Detroit Federation of Teachers - the
union representing Detroit Public
School teachers - questions why the

schools don't use the extra money to
give students access to more educa-
tional materials.
"Wouldn't that $3,000 be better
served buying some additional books
or supplemental material?" he asked.

Applicants to Teach for America hear
about how the program looks for
the best and brightest in student leaders.
They hear about how leadership has been
carefully studied and proven to produce
effective teachers in underprivileged dis-
tricts in the country.
What they hear less about is what hap-
pens when corps members actually enter
the schools.
The past two years represent a peak in
University applicants to TFA, with 461
students applying to the program in 2011
alone.
But complaints from former corps
members have been aired in terms of
training, alack of support and a two-year
teaching commitment that community
leaders say doesn't help schools in need.
How prepared are
the corps members?
After a five-week intensive training
period in one of Teach for America's insti-
tutes across the country, corps members
are sent to their placement schools to
teach.
The corps members have had, on aver-
age, one hour of classroom experience
every day during the five weeks, in addi-
tion to workshops and coaching from
peers or TFA staff members.
For many corps members, this is their
first training in formal education.

In 2011, only 4 percent of e
incoming corps members
were education majors,
while 34 percent majored lp
in social sciences.
The inexperience that
comes with the program is something
that TFA founder and CEO Wendy Kopp
called an "incredible advantage" for the
program in a Jan. 19 speech she gave at
the University.
"One of the reasons Teach for America
works is because we do take people who
ask crazy questions and do crazy things
that anyone who knows what they're
doing would never do," Kopp said.
But some feel that entering an inner
city classroom after five weeks of training
does a disservice to the students.
Keith Johnson, head of the Detroit
Federation of Teachers, the union repre-
senting Detroit Public School teachers,
said he feels TFA members entering into a
classroom "marginalizes the profession"
since other teachers have to go through
formal training before they can teach.
"Why should we settle for some-
one that's providing instruction simply
because they were a math whiz or a sci-
ence whiz or even a foreign language
whiz?" Johnson asked.-
Former corps members admitted to
feeling unprepared for the initial transi-
tion into the classroom.
University alum Mike Dobbs, a 2007

Washington D.C. corps member, said he
struggled to teach in classrooms where
he had to purchase his own copy paper.
"A month is not enough to know how
to set (a classroom) up, particularly in a
place where resources are scarce," Dobbs
said.
University alum Rachel Rickard, a 2011
Baton Rouge corps member who left her
assigned school after two months, said
she faced unexpectedly large classroom
sizes 'and was unprepared to
manage 20 or 21-year-old high
school students who were so e
close to her own age.
"The discipline was some-
thing that I struggled with,"Q
Rickard said. "And when you
have 40 kids in the classroom,
everything that I struggled I
with was magnified." 10
Rickard said she was under
extenuating circumstances, 0
however, because she was ini- ( E
tially hired at a middle school
but then got laid off before the ( C
school year began. Therefore,
she had to quickly search for a
