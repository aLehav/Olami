Next stage of 

projects could focus 
on North Campus 

facilities

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

Over the past decade, the Uni-

versity has undertaken several 
significant efforts to improve resi-
dential life on campus through 
the Residential Life Initiatives, 
launched by University President 
Emerita Mary Sue Coleman in 
2004.

According to University Hous-

ing, nearly 10,000 undergraduate 
students live in one of the Univer-
sity’s 18 residence halls and 1,480 
individual apartments each year. 
When it comes to freshmen spe-
cifically, 97 percent elect to live in 
University housing during their 
first year, meaning most fresh-
men students eat, sleep, study and 
socialize in the University’s resi-
dential spaces.

Since 
the 
program 
was 

launched, the Residence Life Ini-
tiative has pumped millions of dol-

lars into the University’s residence 
halls. West Quad Residential Hall’s 
reopening in the fall will mark the 
end of the initiative’s second phase, 
which included massive projects at 
East Quad and South Quad as well.

Though the University does not 

currently have the funding in place 
for a third phase of the project, sev-
eral University administrators say 
North Campus dorms would likely 
be the focus of a future project.

“Now we’re doing the planning 

to think, well, if that ends in 2017, 
we have a little time now to think 
about what we want to do next,” 
Loren Rullman, associate vice 
president for student affairs, said 
in an interview with The Michigan 
Daily.

Residential Life Initiatives

Citing the connection between 

living and learning, Coleman con-
sistently identified improvements 
to residential life as one of the cor-
nerstones of her presidency.

“I want our university to invest 

time, effort and funding in expand-
ing and improving the residential 
experience of our students,” Cole-
man said in 2004. “We can find a 
host of new ways to provide a bet-
ter environment for learning and

Over 200 march 
from the Union 
to protest sexual 

violence 

By EMMA KINERY 

Daily Staff Reporter

Thursday’s gloomy weather did 

not rain on the parade of activists 
participating in the 37th annual 
Take Back the Night rally.

The event was hosted by the 

student organization University 

Students Against Rape and the 
Ann Arbor chapter of Michigan 
Takes Back the Night, and was 
funded and sponsored by Central 
Student Government.

The rally began at the Michigan 

Union where marchers gathered 
to watch performances by singer 
Hope Thomas and the dance 
groups Salto Dance Company and 
Liem Irish Dance. Several mem-
bers of the organization spoke 
throughout 
the 
performances 

before the march, and one survi-
vor gave a testimonial.

LSA freshman Hayley Walton 

informed attendees of the organi-

zation’s new resource on the Take 
Back the Night’s website, which 
allows survivors to share their sto-
ries with the option of anonymity.

Many ralliers, like LSA fresh-

man Rachel Beglin, noted sexual 
assault as a pertinent issue.

“I haven’t had as horrible of 

an experience as some, but I 
have been definitely personally 
exposed to the way people talk on 
campus,” Beglin said. “It’s really 
not OK and that’s what we’re say-
ing tonight.”

Campus and community orga-

nizations set up tables to advocate 
for their causes related to sexual 

assault awareness and prevention. 
Planned Parenthood, Students For 
Choice, Free Hearts, I Will Week, 
the Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center, SafeHouse, 
What the F magazine, Students 
For Reproductive Justice and pro-
moters of the app Companion all 
had tables at the event.

Take Back the Night also had 

tables selling T-shirts and dis-
tributing wristbands and stick-
ers. They also had a table where 
marchers could write a message of 
hope on a balloon which would be 
released during the march.

Make Michigan 
retains positions 
after UEC resolves 

litigation

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

After a week of litigation, 

LSA junior Cooper Charlton 
and LSA sophomore Steven 
Halperin, Make Michigan pres-
idential-elect and vice presiden-
tial-elect, respectively, will hold 
on to their five-vote lead in this 
year’s Central Student Govern-
ment elections.

Results 
were 
previously 

unofficial due to several pend-
ing cases filed to the Univer-
sity Election Commission by 
The Team and Make Michigan 
against each other. The last 
of those cases were decided 
Wednesday evening. Both par-
ties were found not guilty, and 
both chose not to appeal those 
decisions.

Law student Paige Becker, 

the University’s elections direc-
tor, said the results were now 
certified, due to the decisions.

Along with the presidency 

and vice presidency, results for 
the CSG assembly were also 
certified. Make Michigan won 
23 seats and the Department of 
Public Safety Oversight Com-
mittee seat. The Team won 21 
seats, the Defend Affirmative 

Slate of women 

leaders encourage 
students to engage 

with politics

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Several 
prominent 
state 

female political leaders visited 
the Ford School of Public Policy 
on Thursday to discuss women’s 
experiences running for elected 
office.

The event drew about 50 

attendees, mostly female, and 
was hosted by Graduate Career 
Services and Women and Gen-
der in Public Policy.

U.S. Congresswoman Debbie 

Dingell (D–Mich.) introduced 
the panel, which consisted of 

Gretchen 
Whitmer, 
former 

Michigan 
Senate 
minority 

leader; Regent Kathy White (D), 
chair of the University’s Board 
of Regents; state Rep. Gretchen 
Driskell (D–Saline); and state 
Rep. 
Stephanie 
Chang 
(D–

Detroit). 
Chang 
participated 

via conference call and the rest 
attended in person.

Before the start of the panel, 

Public Policy Dean Susan Col-
lins noted that each of the panel-
ists have a connection the Public 
Policy School, either as students, 
guest lecturers or representa-
tives of the University.

In her introduction, Dingell 

encouraged women to run for 
office because of the different 
viewpoints she said they bring to 
the table.

“Women bring a different 

perspective to the public policy 
arena,” Dingell said. “Women 

are people who have to balance 
more balls than men. The young-
er generation is doing more of 
this than some of my genera-
tion.”

Referencing a book focused 

on the ethics of kindness that she 
said influenced her in college, 
Dingell said she felt “care” was 
what women brought to public 
policy, and that women are bet-
ter at bringing people with dif-
fering viewpoints together.

Chang also noted the different 

approaches that women bring to 
the legislature.

She said women tend to be 

more collaborative as leaders, 
and added that women tend 
to understand policies affect-
ing families, women and chil-
dren better than their male 
colleagues.

Ahead of primary, 
newcomer Will Leaf 
to face long-serving 
member Sabra Briere

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULUOS

Daily Staff Reporter

University alum William Leaf, 

a 2012 graduate, is challenging 
incumbent Sabra Briere (D–Ward 
1) for her 1st Ward City Council 
seat.

In anticipation of the upcoming 

Aug. 4 Democratic primary elec-
tion, Briere and Leaf discussed 
their goals and oftentimes con-
trasting priorities.

The 1st Ward divides Central 

Campus in half. Extending from 
the Law Quad to beyond North 
Campus, it is exemplary of the 
thin lines that exist between city 
and campus. According to a study 
conducted by The Michigan Daily 
in February, 24.54 percent of stu-
dents are registered in the 1st 
Ward, making it the second-high-
est student-registered ward after 
the 2nd Ward.

Briere, a University alum and an 

Ann Arbor resident since 1973, said 
that prior to getting involved with 
City Council she worked a number 
of jobs. Her last job was for a non-
profit organization which she lost 
due during the recession.

“Why do I run again? Part of 

that reason is that I think I am 
really effective in what I am doing. 
That feeling of effectiveness is 
remarkably rewarding,” she said.

Briere has retained her seat 

since her first appointment in 
November 2007. Briere charac-
terizes herself as a City Council 
member who acts independently 
— a strategy she says she tried to 
maintain in what she found to be 
a divided City Council in the past.

“I don’t make decisions based on 

who else is supporting something, 
and I don’t make decisions based 
on personal loyalties,” she said. “I 
make decisions based, as much as 
I can, on the facts in front of me. 
Even when I don’t like the facts. 
They are still facts.”

Briere said one of her main 

strengths is being open to listening 
to people’s problems and listening 
to all sides of an issue.

Her main concerns are infra-

structure changes that may be 
needed due to changing weather 
patterns, increasing pedestrian 
safety and reconsidering zoning 
rules, among others.

“Sometimes it’s about being able 

to see results,” she said. “But some-
times it’s about being able to see 
the big picture. Seeing the moving 
parts and seeing the consequences, 
both the anticipated ones and the 
unanticipated ones that no one was 
expecting to see.”

Briere is also on the city’s Plan-

ning Commission, the Environ-
mental Commission, Housing and 
Human Services Advisory Board

Skatepark 

ordinace would 
create advisory 

commission

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor City Council 

will meet Monday night to discuss 
several resolutions, including an 
agreement with Ann Arbor Recycle 
to meet student move-in needs. 
Council members will also discuss 
the establishment of the Ann Arbor 
Skatepark Advisory Committee 
and an amendment to a lease of 
the Longshore Park parking lot to 
accommodate increased popularity 
of the kayak and canoe rental busi-
ness, Argo Canoe Livery.

Resolution to increase student 

move-out services

Last 
June, 
City 
Council 

approved a three-year contract 
with Recycle Ann Arbor to pro-

vide complete solid waste services 
at the corner of Tappan Street 
and Oakland Avenue during stu-
dent fall and spring move-in at the 
University. The $35,000 contract 
includes staffing the site, providing 
roll-off container service and reuse 
options.

Recycle Ann Arbor is a non-

profit organization that provides 
education and services in recycling 
collection, processing and distri-
bution within the city.

Following 
a 
community-

expressed need for an extra week 
of services during the fall, the city 
proposed this increase to their 
original waste removal plan. If 
passed, the fall services will be 
extended to a total of 21 days. 
According to the contract, the city 
can adjust the numbers as needed. 
The spring move-in services will 
remain at 12 days.

It was also discovered that there 

was an increase in illegal dumping 
of Freon-containing appliances, 
exceeded the original contract’s 
expectations. According to the 

resolution, dumping levels may 
remain at this higher level.

This extension of services will 

increase the cost of the service by 
$15,000 per year.

Resolution establishing Skate-

park Advisory Committee

Sponsored by councilmembers 

Julie Grand (D–Ward 3) and Mike 
Anglin (D–Ward 5), this resolution 
proposes to establish a Skatepark 
Advisory Committee to help Ann 
Arbor operate and maintain the 
Ann Arbor Skatepark, located at 
Veterans Memorial Park on Jack-
son Avenue.

City Council approved an agree-

ment between the Friends of the 
Ann Arbor Skatepark and the City 
of Ann Arbor for the upkeep of the 
park in July 2013.

If passed, the Skatepark Advi-

sory Committee would have nine 
members serving two-year terms. 
The members would be appointed 
by City Council, and would include 
at least one person from City Park 
staff, Washtenaw County Parks & 
Recreation staff and the City Park 
Advisory Commission. The com-
mittee would also have at least two 
people who are either director or 
officer of the Friends of the Ann 
Arbor Skatepark.

Resolution to amend a lease 

with Huron River Holdings, Inc.

Since 2012, the parking lot at 

416 Longshore Dr. has been used to 
accommodate parking needs at the 
Argo Livery.

The original lease terms stated 

the city could use the parking lot 
only until noon Saturdays, Sun-
days and holidays between Memo-
rial Day and Labor Day. However, 
the Huron River and Cascades are 
popular recreation sites for inner 
tubing and kayaking, resulting in 
the parking lot being used for over-
flow about every day of the week.

If passed, this resolution calls 

for the city to pay an additional 
$9,000 annually in response to the 
increased use of the Longshore 
Drive parking lot.

The terms of the lease will 

extend from April 18, 2015, to Oct. 
25, 2015, with an administrative 
renewal option for two successive 
one-year periods.

Student survey 
talks poverty

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

At a panel hosted by the 

University’s chapter of Col-
lege 
Democrats 
on 
Thurs-

day, community leaders from 
Washtenaw County discussed 
several topics relating to income 
inequality.

The event focused on several 

different areas, namely poverty 
and income inequality, as well 
as local policy initiatives to 
combat both issues.

On the panel were Yousef 

Rabhi, vice chair of the Board 
of Commissioners for Washt-
enaw County, Keta Cowan, 
chief executive officer of Synod 
Residential Services, a nonprofit 
that provides services to mar-
ginalized and disabled citizens 
in Southeast Michigan, and 
Sociology Lecturer Ian Robin-
son, president of the Huron Val-
ley Central Labor Council.

The panel followed an unveil-

ing of a survey disseminated by 
the College Democrats’ social 
justice committee, JustDems, 

to gauge campus awareness on 
poverty. The survey included 
270 University students, which 
represents about 1 percent of 
the undergraduate student pop-
ulation. Members of JustDems 
were included in the survey 
tally.

Results showed a lack of 

awareness 
about 
the 
issue 

among respondents in several 
areas. Survey respondents iden-
tified the minimum income a 
family of four needs to afford 
necessities for living as $58,437, 
$34,187 under what the federal 
poverty line estimates. Respon-
dents also misestimated the 
percentage of the national pop-
ulation in poverty at 22 percent, 
7.5 percent higher than the true 
population.

However, when asked about 

the survey results, Robinson 
said students’ incorrect guesses 
about the poverty line are not 
entirely in touch with reality, 
citing the United Way’s Asset 
Limited, Income Constrained, 
Employed report. The study 
gauged 
the 
basic 
minimal 

income for a family to live in 
Michigan was around $60,600, 
significantly closer to the sur-
vey results than the federal pov-

erty line estimate.

From the survey results, 

Cowan said she learned a major-
ity of students identified that 
there is a standard of living 
below which they are not inter-
ested in living, yet many Ameri-
cans do live below the poverty 
line.

“Imagine 
what 
a 
person 

who’s actually impoverished is 
experiencing, it’s not a quality 
of life that any of you would be 
interested in pursuing,” Cowan 
said.

Robinson, 
who 
recently 

spearheaded a report to gauge 
the state of income inequality in 
Washtenaw County, also high-
lighted several of the project’s 
recommendations during his 
comments.

The report found that income 

inequality is growing in the 
area and that more than half of 
the county have seen a decline 
in their pay since 2005. It sug-
gested the creation of a local 
task force to combat income 
equality, which has since been 
created.

“There is not only … growing 

inequality but a growing share

Organizers 
signified 
them-

selves by wearing teal-colored 
shirts, and counselors for anyone 
who needed help during the event 
wore white armbands. Survivors 
were encouraged to wear teal 
arm bands if they felt comfortable 
doing so.

One of the speakers on behalf 

of Take Back the Night noted the 
organization’s frustration with 
the lack of attention University 
officials have given to the pre-
vention sexual assault. They said 
when they reached out to Univer-

speak at the event, he said he was 
unavailable, but would send some-
one else from his administration. 
However, they said, no one from 
the administration came. Mem-

as the University not making sexu-
al assault prevention a priority.

Quinn Davis, organizer and 

community member, listed off 
statistics about the rate of sexual 
assault, as well as defining con-
sent. She said one-fifth of women 
and one out of 71 men are raped 
in their lifetime; one-fourth of all 
women and one-sixth of all men 
experience sexual assault in their 
lifetime. She also said a majority of 
individuals are raped before they 
turn 24 and 42 percent are raped 
before they turn 18.

“Are we making any progress? 

Yes,” Davis said. “The Rape Abuse 
and Incest National Network 

estimates that the rate of sexual 
assault has fallen by more than 50 
percent in recent years.”

Before the march, Gretchen 

Whitmer, former Michigan Sen-
ate minority leader, expressed her 
experiences in combating sexual 
assault. Whitmer is an advocate 
of speaking against sexual assault. 
During debates in the Michigan 
Senate in December 2013 when a 
proposed healthcare law would 
not cover abortions for rape vic-
tims and the legislature would not 
allow anyone to be brought in to 
testify, she did.

Whitmer discussed her deci-

sion to break her silence as a sur-
vivor at 42 after being raped her 
freshman year of college. She 
recalled the frightening decision 
to finally speak about her experi-
ence after years keeping it private.

Whitmer was upset when her 

testimony did not sway any votes 
and characterized it as the worst 
time while she was in office. 
However, her outlook changed 
when she realized how important 
the moment was for her when 
she went to her office to find her 
e-mail inbox and voicemail full 
with messages from other survi-
vors thanking her.

“That’s when I realized it did 

have value to talk about it,” Whit-
mer said. “It added to the con-
versation that is long overdue in 
our state and in our country, long 
overdue. To the extent that I was 
involved in to encourage someone, 
anyone, to share their story, it was 
worth talking about. It’s at events 
like these that help women like us 

to know we are not alone, that we 
do not have to be silent. We are not 
alone. And we do not have to be 
silent.”

After she spoke, organizers 

asked men to sign a poster pledg-
ing to stand against sexual assault. 
About 50 men signed the pledge. 
LSA freshman Yong-Joon Kim 
said she believes sexual assault 
affects everyone on campus.

“Sexual assault and the prob-

lems that this culture faces with 
rape and the gender gap really 
drove me to come because it’s a 
really important issue for me,” Kim 
said “I have a younger sister and I 
want the best for her. This isn’t just 
an issue that affects women, it’s an 
issue that affects every gender on 
campus. I feel this is a really big 
thing, and with the University of 
Michigan still on Title IX’s watch 
list ... it’s just something I feel has 
to be changed.”

Organizers took turns read-

ing demands from a list of initia-
tives they hope will result from 
the night’s events. Their demands 
included: a call for the end to sex-
ual assault and violence, acknowl-
edgement that “no means no,” that 
consent is only active and sober, 
that domestic violence and assault 
be considered human problems 
instead of women’s issues and for 
recognition that victims are never 
responsible.

Throughout the past week, 

there have been demonstrations 
against sexual assault on campus 
in honor of Sexual Assault Aware-
ness Month. Tuesday, there was a 
Sharing with Survivors Speakout 

in the Michigan League hosted by 
Michigan Takes Back the Night, 
and a Diag Day on Wednesday 
hosted by SAPAC to inform stu-
dents on consent.

The ralliers left the Union at 

8:30 p.m. and marched approxi-
mately 1.6 miles for one hour 
around Ann Arbor to Liberty 
Street before returning back to 
have an electric-candlelight vigil 
in the Union to the song “Lean on 
Me.”

Armed with makeshift drums, 

signs, and a handout of chants, 
approximately 200 people of all 
ages took to the streets. Organiz-
ers led chants such as, “We have 
the power. We have the right. The 
streets are ours! Take Back the 
Night,” and “Hey hey, ho ho, sex-
ual assault has got to go!”

On Thompson Street, march-

ers were asked to be silent and 
link arms to honor those who have 
died as a result of sexual assault, as 
well as release the balloons. Ann 
Arbor residents left their homes 
and apartments, and diners and 
restaurant staff left businesses to 
watch the ralliers go by. People 
in cars and on buses took photos, 
honked and chanted along with 
the group in support.

The march was not only 

attended by University students — 
Washtenaw Community College 
junior Michelle Smolarski said 
her girlfriend encouraged her to 
attend the event and that she felt 
powerful during the march.

“I felt very amazing and brave 

and very uplifted,” Smolarski said.

Action Party won one seat and 14 
seats were awarded to indepen-
dent or write-in candidates.

In an interview Thursday 

afternoon, Charlton, the newly 
elected CSG president, said he 
was looking forward to begin-
ning his role.

“It’s nice to finally come up for 

air,” Charlton said. “It’s a long 
process. Unfortunately it felt like 
it got a little political towards the 
end, which I don’t think is fair to 
the students, and I apologize we 
were going back and forth. But at 
the end of the day I think both 
The Team, the DAAP party and 
Make Michigan all are highly 
qualified and genuinely beautiful 
people that are all trying to make 
a difference and Steven and I are 
just honored we have this oppor-
tunity.”

Discussing the litigation pro-

cess, which has delayed results 
in CSG elections several times 
in recent years, Charlton said it 
should be a balance of promoting 
fairness while not misusing the 
process.

“It’s one of those things where 

we need to have it in a case where 
there’s been blatant cheating, but 
we also have to hold ourselves 
accountable,” he said. “We can’t 
just use this resource to drag out 
the process or to try to find the 
loophole. It’s meant to specifi-
cally target blatant and provable 
cheating. At the end of the day, 
everyone wanted to win, but it’s 
a very hard question to answer.”

LSA senior Annie Pidgeon, 

Make Michigan party chair, said 
the next step in the process is 
bringing CSG together.

“I think a lot of times what 

happens when you get elected to 

CSG, especially when there’s two 
big parties, is there’s not enough 
collaboration,” 
Pidgeon 
said. 

“I think the next step for Make 
Michigan is to unify CSG.”

Charlton said he had already 

collected descriptions of what 
each representative, regardless 
of party affiliation, wanted to 
do with their term. He added 
that he and Halperin hadn’t yet 
selected other members of the 
executive team, and planned to 
invite members from all parties 
to compete for selection.

LSA 
junior 
Jacob 
Abuda-

ram, the campaign manager for 
The Team, said though he dis-
agrees with University Elections 
Commission’s decision, he still 
respects the committee and the 
election process. He said mem-
bers of The Team are looking 
forward to keep working on the 
party’s initiatives.

“Will and Matt will continue 

to do their work,” he said. “Will 
is bringing in 42 students from 
underrepresented high schools 
in Kalamazoo next week. We’re 
excited to see what The Team 
representatives will do and the 
work they’ll do with the Make 
Michigan reps.”

In a Facebook post Thursday 

morning, LSA sophomore Matt 
Fidel, vice presidential candidate 
for The Team, called the experi-
ence of running difficult, but 
rewarding.

“It wasn’t always easy, but this 

election has been quite a valu-
able learning experience,” Fidel 
said. “I am humbled and honored 
to have been given the opportu-
nity to run for vice president of 
the student body of the greatest 
university in the world.”

articles that show women tend 
to be more collaborative lead-
ers, to be very thorough, to work 
with people and solve problems, 
and those are things that women 
tend to do on a day-to-day basis,” 
Chang said. “Ultimately the goal 
is not just to get more people into 
office, but one of the results of that 
is better policy — better policy 
making especially for families, for 
children, for women.”

White said for many of the posi-

tions she has held, she was the first 
Black female to assume that role. 
She echoed Chang’s sentiments on 
the importance of increased rep-
resentation in government roles.

“Men have the same interest as 

women do — we want to have rep-
resentative government that rep-
resents all,” White said. “It’s just 
a better way to have great democ-
racy: by not excluding 50 percent 
of the population.”

Whitmer agreed, emphasizing 

the importance of diversity in the 
legislature.

“The beauty of our system is it 

is diverse, and it works best when 
all voices are heard,” Whitmer 
said. “You can be a farmer or a 
pharmacist in the legislature, and 
(that) works better when we have 
many different voices that are part 
of the debate.”

Questions from the audience 

were taken throughout the event. 
Attendees asked what made each 
woman want to run for office, what 
advice the panelists would give for 
women interested in running for 

office and what they wished some-
one would have told them when 
they were starting their career.

The panelists also discussed 

their experiences campaigning 
and in elected office, encourag-
ing interested students to follow 
in their footsteps. Many of the 
panelists said they didn’t think 
they would ever run for office and 
had to be pushed by their friends 
and mentors to do so, or ran only 
after they saw an issue not being 
addressed.

Whitmer noted that when she 

entered Michigan’s state Sen-
ate the ratio between men and 
women was at its historic height — 
12 women to 38 men — which she 
called both an accomplishment, 
but also a sign that there was still a 
ways to go. The current ratio is at 
four women to 46 men.

“In the last session, there were 

more men named John in the 
Michigan Senate than women,” 
Whitmer said. “It’s really impor-
tant that our voices are heard. 
I’ve said it once and have repeated 
many times: if you’re not at the 
table, you’re on the menu.”

Dingell said she thought the 

current 
low 
representation 

stemmed equally from gender as 
from disinterest and distrust in 
government in this generation.

“I’m actually going to say: I 

don’t think this is a gender issue,” 
Dingell said. “I think we’ve got a 
problem in this country that people 
feel disconnected from the govern-
ment. Voting is at an all time low, 
people don’t think that they mat-
ter and that they can make a dif-
ference, and we need to get people 
engaged.”

living in our residence halls.”

When the plan for phase one 

of the RLI — titled the Compre-
hensive Housing Plan— was first 
presented to the University’s 
Board of Regents in September 
2004, it included proposals for a 
new residence hall, renovations to 
two existing residence halls and 
upgrades for several campus din-
ing facilities.

Rullman said a handful of fac-

tors have allowed the University 
to make significant improvements 
to campus structures over the past 
decade.

“We’ve had a very favorable 

bond market, construction mar-
ket, very generous donors, very 
supportive regents and very sup-
portive students who have partici-
pated,” Rullman said. “Those four 
factors over the last 10 years have 
been tremendous.”

Mosher-Jordan Residence Hall 

was the first large renovation 
completed under the RLI, during 
the first phase. In 2008, Mosher-
Jordan reopened after a two-year, 
$65 million renovation. The reno-
vation included a new, two-story 
dining center and set a precedent 
for campus dining facilities in 
terms of number of food options, 
scale and central location.

In 2010, construction of the 

$175 million North Quad Residen-
tial and Academic Complex was 
completed. The dorm, which is 
restricted to upperclassmen, was 
recently named one of the 30 most 
luxurious student housing build-
ings in the country by Best College 
Values. Before North Quad was 
completed, Bursley Hall, opened 
in 1967, was the newest residence 
hall at the University.

Kicking off the second phase of 

the project, East Quad and South 
Quad underwent multi-million 
dollar renovations, re-opening in 
Fall 2013 and Fall 2014, respective-
ly. Both residence halls received 
refurbished community rooms, 
dining facilities and bathrooms.

This fall, West Quad, also a part 

of the initiative’s second phase, 
will see changes as well. Origi-
nally built in 1937, it will re-open 
following a $114.5 million make-
over. The renovation will remove 
the dining center to provide space 
for additional community rooms. 
The expanded South Quad dining 
hall was designed to provide space 
for the resulting influx of Central 
Campus diners.

The RLI has been divided into 

distinct phases — phase one, from 
2004 to 2012, included renovating 
the Hill Dining Center, Mosher-
Jordan Hall, Stockwell Residence 
Hall, North Quad, Couzens Resi-
dence Hall and Alice Lloyd Resi-
dence Hall, while phase two has 
included the East, West and South 
Quad renovations.

Though Rullman said approxi-

mately one-third of the Univer-
sity’s housing inventory has yet to 
be fully renovated, the first round 
of improvements funded life safe-
ty systems for every residence hall.

“One of the things we’ve done 

in all of our buildings already are 
life safety improvements,” Rul-
lman said. “So all of our buildings 
are incredibly safe, they just don’t 
all have brand new finishes in the 
bathroom and energy efficient fix-
tures and that kind of thing in all 
the bathrooms.”

The construction portion of 

phase two will conclude with the 
re-opening of West Quad, but the 
financing for phase two will carry 
into 2017. Financing for phase two 
entails a 3-percent increase on 
room and board rates.

“We say phasing so people 

understand you just can’t do it all 
at once,” said Rullman. “We have 
a commitment to make sure that 
all of our students over time live 
in good, healthy, productive facili-
ties.”

Henry Baier, associate vice 

president for facilities and opera-
tions, added that many external 
observers don’t see the extensive 
planning that goes into the reno-
vations.

“I think a lot of students don’t 

appreciate the length of time that 
it takes,” he said. “It’s not because 
we’re slow … they all take a while 
because you have to plan it out and 
get the construction underway. 
Even once we decide where we’re 
going there’s some start-up time 
that the public doesn’t see.”

Choosing buildings for reno-

vation

Baier said the University uses a 

deferred maintenance program to 
keep up with campus renovations. 
Through the program, the Uni-
versity conducts regular surveys 
and tracks maintenance records to 
see which buildings are in need of 
upgrades. It is designed to include 
day-to-day maintenance proce-
dures, planned renovations and 
major updates.

Baier said though the Univer-

sity has used a deferred mainte-
nance program for a while, the 
lack of regular upkeep in the years 
prior to the RLI left many Univer-
sity buildings in need of renova-
tion.

“What happened in residen-

tial life and housing, basically the 
housing system wasn’t re-invest-
ing in deferred maintenance,” 
Baier said. “It’s an easy thing to do, 
money gets tight, you don’t want 
to charge a student more to stay in 
University housing, so then the way 
you do that is you don’t keep it up, 
you just let stuff go. It just degrades, 
and all of a sudden you have to put a 
lot more money into it.”

Rullman said there is a common 

formula used to determine which 
buildings should be renovated. 
The University conducts facil-
ity condition assessments prior to 
renovations to determine which 
buildings are in need of updates. 
These assessments seek to deter-
mine both the state of the building 
and whether or not the University 
should keep the building.

Rullman said the buildings reno-

vated in phases one and two of the 
RLI were chosen both because they 
were in poor condition and because 
the University saw them as “impor-
tant, distinctive buildings.”

“The West Quads and the East 

Quads, they are iconic, they are 
architecturally significant, they 
have been here a very long time, 
their location is great, it would be 
unlikely we would not have resi-
dence halls there for the future,” 
Rullman said. “So once you know 
the condition, then you make a set 
of institutional policy decisions — 
in this case that we’re not going to 
abandon our legacy buildings.”

Baier added that in planning 

University renovations, they try 
to be flexible because unexpected 
factors such as increasing con-
struction and bond costs or large 
donations often impact which 
buildings are chosen for renova-
tion. He referenced in particular 
University alum Charles Munger, 
vice chairman of Berkshire Hatha-
way Corporation, who has donat-
ed significantly to the school. 
Munger recently contributed $110 
million to the construction of a 
new graduate residence on central 
campus.

“Along comes Charlie Munger 

and he gives us $20 million to 
help fix up the Lawyers Club,” 
Baier said. “That had a $28 mil-
lion deferred maintenance on our 
facility condition assessment and 
we had a donor who was inter-
ested in contributing $20 million 
toward an existing building to fix 
it up, that’s unheard of. We might 
have gone and done something 
else, whatever it might have been, 
but here’s $20 million and it made 
it a big priority.”

After the plans were released, 

many graduate students expressed 
concerns related to the cost and 
design of the project. However, 
during a forum in 2013, E. Royster 
Harper, vice president for student 
life, noted the nature of the dona-
tion somewhat limits the Univer-
sity’s ability to make changes.

“If this were ‘just us’ and the 

funding were ‘just us,’ we would 
have some different kinds of 
options,” Harper said. “But I think 
when you are in partnership … 
you make some agreements about 
what you’re going to offer, then we 
have to honor those agreements.”

Future renovations

Though Rullman said phase 

two of the RLI will conclude in the 
near future because all the allo-
cated money has been used, the 
University still plans to continue 
renovating.

Rullman said the University 

will conduct facility condition 
assessments and student satisfac-
tion surveys, on top of evaluating 
the bond market and interest rates, 
to determine which buildings will 
be renovated in the next phase.

“We don’t know what we’re 

going to renovate next, but we 
think all of the buildings are safe 
and adequate, we just need to 
improve the experience,” he said.

Recent comments from admin-

istrators, as well as from the Uni-
versity’s Board of Regents, have 
suggested that North Campus 
might be the next area to undergo 
construction.

In an October interview with 

The Michigan Daily, Harper said 
it’s likely that if a new undergradu-

ate dorm were constructed in the 
future, North Campus would be 
a potential location. She cited the 
decreasing availability of open 
Central Campus property, and the 
desire to improve the community 
on North Campus.

At a fireside chat in March , 

University President Mark Schlis-
sel acknowledged that the qual-
ity of life on North Campus is an 
issue that has been brought up at 
nearly every fireside chat in recent 
months.

“The residential life is in the 

midst of a 10- or 15-year effort to 
really upgrade residential life, liv-
ing and eating on campus,” he said. 
“The next frontier is the North 
Campus.”

At last month’s Board of Regents 

meeting, the regents approved 
two North Campus construction 
proposals — schematic designs for 
the North Campus Grove project 
and a $13 million renovation of the 
North Campus Recreation Build-
ing.

During the March event, Schlis-

sel said the University wants to 
improve North Campus so that it is 
on par with the rest of the campus.

“The ultimate goal is to make 

the North Campus as dense and 
vibrant as the Central Campus, 
and to have the businesses sur-
rounding North Campus sort of 
grow up in a way that living up 
there won’t require you to be down 
here to socialize,” he said.

Baier said the University is 

working on plans to increase 
development of North Campus.

“We’ve actually done a lot of 

work on North Campus in terms of 
early planning and we have some 
ideas about what we’d like it to be,” 
he said. “It’s more of an aspiration, 
it’s not concrete in terms of what it 
would be.”

Both Baier and Rullman noted 

that several renovations and addi-
tions have taken place on North 
Campus in recent years — Mitchell 
Field, the Fireside Café in Pierpont 
Commons, the Walgreen Drama 
Center, the Stamps Auditorium 
and M City, a network of roads 
used to test automated vehicle sys-
tems.

There are also plans for several 

North Campus projects aside from 
the grove and the NCRB renova-
tions. The construction of an addi-
tion to the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance is currently underway, 
and there are plans to add on to the 
Art and Architecture Building. In 
addition, the Bursley Dining Hall 
will receive new furniture and car-
pet over the summer.

Rullman said there has been an 

emphasis on improving the den-
sity of North Campus.

“There’s a lot going on up there 

… and we need to do more, frankly, 
but what we’re doing now and 
what we’ve done over the last 
eight, nine, 10 years is try to make 
it a much more livable place for 
students, for faculty, for staff,” 
Rullman said. “I think when you 
look at all the improvements on 
balance, it’s doing that. The chal-
lenge is it is such a big campus and 
until you get this density you sort 
of can’t notice it.”

of the unequal are below the 

poverty line,” Robinson said.

Along with directly address-

ing the monetary inequities, 
Rahbi said an additional way to 
combat inequality within the 
community was to remove bar-
riers that could prevent impov-
erished citizens from living a 
comfortable life.

He mentioned, in particular, 

the City Council’s plan to distrib-
ute Washtenaw County ID cards 

for citizens who do not have 
proof of documentation — usu-
ally undocumented immigrants, 
the elderly and those under the 
poverty line.

“All the people that live in 

our county are people, and they 
all deserve to be treated equally 
when it comes to government 
services or even just when you 
go to get your birthday dinner 
and they ask for your driver’s 
license,” he said. “Your ID helps 
you to be human, and so we 
dehumanize a lot of our citizens 
by not providing that.”

I 

have often found myself drawn 
to men of color. In high school, 
a handsome, Black athlete made 

my 
body 
feel 

something that no 
white boy in high 
socks 
had 
ever 

been able to do. 
My attraction to 
him was magnetic 
— and I justified 
it as such to my 
white girlfriends 
who just “weren’t 
into Black guys.” 
Being a student 
at a majority-white high school, I 
shamefully felt the need to justify my 
attraction to a minority student by 
referring to it as “carnal.” It couldn’t 
just be attraction. It couldn’t avoid 
explanation. It had to be because 
my body was heavy with desire, or 
because he was a great guy. It had 
to be because of something, because 
we were different, and because oth-
erwise, to my peers, to this world, it 
wouldn’t make sense.

My oldest sister, a college stu-

dent at the time, proposed a biologi-
cal explanation: “You’re probably 
attracted to Black guys because bio-
logically you want to diversify 
your gene pool for your offspring.” 
Freshly immersed in evolutionary 
anthropology classes, she tended to 
overanalyze situations that required 
no analysis. There was the opposing 
argument that same-race prefer-
ences in sexual relationships actu-
ally benefitted the biological fitness 
of one’s offspring. The latter argu-
ment, the racist argument, was the 
one the majority of our white bodies 
abided by.

As I experienced it, conversations 

on race-based attraction occurred 
all too much. Over cafeteria lunches, 
we talked about hook-ups — ones 
that had happened the weekend 
before, ones that would happen the 
following weekend, ones that we 
wished would happen but never 
would due to the ever-present, very 
unscathed social hierarchy of high 
school. A boy might have said some-
thing like, “There’s no one in school 
that I want to hook up with,” and if 
on the rare occasion someone pro-
posed the option of hooking up with 
a Black girl, he might have said, “I’m 
not attracted to Black girls.” Then, 
directed at the one Black person 
sitting at the table, he might have 
added, “No offense.”

“No offense” was a phrase used 

so often, uttered so reflexively, and 
yet was so overtly offensive. It was 
said with the ingrained belief that no 
matter what came before it, as long 
as it was followed by “no offense,” 
the person saying something objec-
tionable would be absolved. I can’t 
know what it must have felt like to be 
a person of color in that situation, lis-

tening to an ignorant white kid deem 
your whole race unattractive, but I 
can only imagine that it was painful.

I won’t deny the fact that like 

many of my peers, my sexual prefer-
ences have at times been reduced to 
specific racial groups. It’s a deeply 
concerning reality that no matter the 
person, no matter how kind or good-
looking or smart they are, if they fall 
into a certain racial category that has 
been routinely associated with physi-
cal dislike, they’re not then consid-
ered to be the most “viable mate.”

Over Spring Break, my housemates 

and I traveled to Naples, Florida, for 
the week. It’s a small town — expen-
sive, well manicured, brimming with 
rich, old white people. We download-
ed Tinder for the occasion, having 
little intention of utilizing it for its 
intended purpose: a meet-up. One of 
my housemates, my good friend — a 
beautiful Indian woman — swiped 
her fingers across the screen of her 
phone, sifting through the mounds 
of Florida preps who had “just moved 
to Naples, looking for a good time.” 
After a little while and only a few 
matches, she set the phone down. “I 
miss Ann Arbor,” she sighed. “People 
here are so racist.”

It was true. A platform like Tin-

der, a dating app governed by the 
laws of attraction, fosters racism. 
A person’s face comes into focus on 
the screen, and if it’s not the color of 
your liking, you swipe left. No con-
sequences. No one judging you for 
your “inherent” sexual preferences. 
There’s no need to justify why you 
did or didn’t swipe left as it applies 
to race. And this is arguably a more 
concerning form of racism, the kind 
hidden behind a screen, the kind 
that holds no one accountable.

So, here is the pivotal question: 

Is race-based attraction inher-
ent, or is it informed by the racial 
associations that permeate our cul-
ture so deeply? When, during my 
semester spent abroad, I strolled 
the streets of Havana and received 
cat calls that often began with 
hola blanca, “hey white girl,” was 
I in part being targeted due to my 
whiteness? Absolutely, because a 
country so polluted by slavery and 
racial inequality can only construct 
a reality in which a white person, 
the former imperialist, is associat-
ed with superiority. And that is only 
talking about Cuba, not America, 
where racial inequality exists not 
only because of our past history, but 
also because of our present history.

It would absolve us of any social 

responsibility if we denied the 
fact that attraction is informed by 
implicit racial biases, because to do 
so would deny the complex systems 
of racial inequality and racial con-
trol that America has created. For 
instance, our knowledge of the fact 
that the majority of incarcerated 

people in this country are minorities 
does permit us to form a racist asso-
ciation: If you are a person of color, 
you are more likely to be a criminal. 
To deny this association is to deny 
the fact that we are racist because 
of the complicated racially advised 
context in which we live. And to 
deny that is to deny that racism can 
and should be unlearned.

There are arguments suggesting 

that same-race preference is, in fact, 
inherent. It’s thought that we are 
intrinsically attracted to ourselves, 
and that in unfamiliar situations, 
we gravitate toward those who look 
the same as us. This is corroborated 
by the clumps of people seen walk-
ing together on campus, categorized 
by their skin color, and occasionally 
sporting their token friend of color.

While this might be argued as bio-

logical, it doesn’t really matter if it is 
or isn’t. Same-race-based attraction 
manifests the assumption that racial 
difference indicates cultural and 
economic difference, thus making 
integration uncomfortable. Our soci-
ety has surpassed the need to explain 
or justify things biologically because 
we negate our biological needs every 
day due to technological progress. In 
which case, it doesn’t matter if there 
is an innateness to same-race prefer-
ence — that preference, regardless of 
its foundation, has been dramatically 
shaped by racism.

We’re used to relying on our 

attraction in order to dictate our 
sexual 
and 
romantic 
pursuits. 

Attraction feels chemical, and it 
is, so we go along with it. If it says, 
“You only like white guys,” then 
that’s who we seek out — white 
guys. However, as we abide by what 
our bodies might tell us without 
challenging why, in fact, we feel 
that way, we negate the possibil-
ity for our preferences to expand. 
There’s no use in pretending that 
we wear no racial lens when at 
a party, when on a dating app or 
when we’re noticing someone on 
the street. But to recognize that 
lens as problematic is to recognize 
race-based preference as a problem.

This 
acknowledgment 
is 
not 

intended to instill guilt. Guilt, at 
its core, is useless. It’s meant to call 
into question whether or not “just 
not being into” a specific race is OK. 
It’s meant to seek an answer as to 
why we are willing to justify racism 
on the basis of physical attraction. 
It’s meant to propel the shedding of 
certain associations that may have 
caused you to consider an entire 
group of people unattractive. Iden-
tify those associations. Feed them to 
yourself. Remember that attraction is 
based upon so much more than skin. 
I’ll remember this, too.

Dear Michigan Law School community,
The #BlackLivesMatter movement does 

not represent a new fight or a novel message. 
#BlackLivesMatter is only the current name 
on an ever-present struggle. The University, in 
its own right, has struggled with race since this 
law school was founded, since Gabriel Franklin 
Hargo received his diploma, since we fought in 
our nation’s highest court to protect our com-
mitment to diversity.

The core message of the #BlackLivesMatter 

movement has always existed in different forms, 
under different banners, calling attention to the 
continued racial oppression of minorities in 
American society. In its most recent iteration, 
the movement grew in response to the post-
humous trial of Trayvon Martin for his own 
murder. #BlackLivesMatter, per its website, is 
“Rooted in the experiences of Black people in 
this country who actively resist our de-human-
ization, #BlackLivesMatter is a call to action 
and a response to the virulent anti-Black racism 
that permeates our society.”

This letter is the University of Michigan 

Law School community’s contribution to 
the #BlackLivesMatter National Law Stu-
dent Day of Action that occurred on April 
2, 2015.

It cannot be overstated that critical race 

and economic discourses in higher educa-
tion — especially law school — are at best 
overlooked and at worst invalidated and 
misrepresented. Support from faculty and 
administration is an important institutional 
validation of students’ desire to self-educate 
about the legal hardships burdening racial 
minorities in this country.

Law schools have an imperative to take this 

movement seriously, and to reflect on our own 
role in perpetuating systems of racial oppres-
sion. Beyond reflection, we also have an obliga-
tion to take action. The law, truthfully, is both 
part of the problem and part of the solution. 
Here, at the University, many student organiza-
tions and professors have responded to recent 
events through activism at the Law School. But 
we can and must do more.

***
We call on our Michigan Law community to 

achieve the following:

First, we ask students to recognize their 

own power to change the classroom dis-
course on race and the law;

To demand race-conscious, intersectional 

conversations in classrooms from professors 
and each other;

To push for a curriculum that challenges 

students to think creatively about the law, so 
as to advance color-conscious claims on behalf 
of clients;

To continue to work with one another to shift 

the collective consciousness of the Law School 
beyond acknowledgment of racial inequality 
and toward tangible solutions;

To include people of color in student-led pro-

gramming; and,

To remember that as law students, we are 

entering a space of privilege and power, and it is 
our obligation, regardless of our future career 
paths, to continue to check our own biases and 
role in perpetuating inequality and oppression.

All students, regardless of career path, seek 

acknowledgement and meaningful inclusiv-
ity by students, faculty and administration. As 
peers, we have an obligation to pursue honest 
conversations with one another about race and 
other marginalized identities.

Next, we call on faculty to actively take 

on the challenge of incorporating discus-
sions of race into their classrooms and 
curriculums;

To nurture passionate and conscientious stu-

dents, who respect each others’ diverse back-
grounds and experiences;

To talk about race, recognize that the facts 

of cases matter, especially those involving race, 
and to include them in discussion. In taking 
the safest route toward teaching the cases, by 
avoiding such facts, professors are implicitly 
teaching students to accept the cases as they 
stand. Professors control the dialogue, and fear 
of losing control is not a sufficient justification 
for ignoring these demands;

To reevaluate their pedagogy, regardless of 

tenure, and incorporate social justice dialogues 
along the way, not just while discussing Goetz 
or Dred Scott;

To, with administration, recruit and tenure 

minority faculty, both in gender and race; and,

To question the status quo, give historical 

context to the casebook, and confront the reali-
ties of social inequality and injustice head on. 
The law does not stand separate from the soci-
ety and history from which it is produced.

If these demands seem shortsighted or too 

burdensome, we pose these questions to the 
faculty: If these difficult conversations do not 
occur during law school, when are students to 
learn the practical consequences of the cases 
we study and ultimately litigate? If not now, 
then at what stage in our legal careers should 
we open our eyes to the social, political and 
historical realities that perpetuate racial and 
class hierarchies?

Finally, we call on the Law School admin-

istration to support students and faculty in 
accomplishing these goals.

It is an obvious reality that there are sig-

nificant hurdles facing minority law school 
applicants. From the outset, minorities must 
overcome a variety of economic, educational, 
social and political hurdles just to get their foot 
in the door. The racial composition of our Law 
School, and the legal field at large, unequivo-
cally demonstrates this fact.

Because of these realities, we ask that the 

administration continue to recruit minor-
ity applicants to our Law School, intentionally 
providing a culture and classroom that is sup-
portive and welcoming to all students, for the 
benefit of all students.

We ask everyone to take a stand. Students, 

faculty and administrators should be an active 
voice in the local and national movement — host 
events, contribute to scholarship, make public 
statements of support. Keep the momentum 
alive. Injustice remains. We must act — today. 
Take a picture of yourself holding a sign 
that says, “MLaw believes #BlackLive-
Matter” and post to social media with the 
#BlackLivesMatter and #MLaw.

***
The University has always taken a leadership 

role in addressing longstanding racial inequali-
ties. In casebooks, we are remembered for reso-
lutely defending affirmative action in Grutter 
v. Bollinger — and we must continue to protect 
such important principles.

Michigan Law is an undeniably special 

place. Our aim in this letter is to show sup-
port for the #BlackLivesMatter movement 
and improve race-based dialogues and prac-
tices within our community. We believe that 
though much been done already, there is much 
more that we can do.

Take a stand

T

here may be three games 
left to go, and the month 
of March has already come 

and 
gone, 
but 

without a doubt, I 
was not a winner 
of March Mad-
ness.

Of course, I can 

take solace in the 
fact that I have 
lost along with 
every single other 
person who filled 
out 
a 
bracket. 

Rarely do perfect 
brackets last beyond the first day of 
games, and this year was no differ-
ent. And for part of the first round, 
my bracket was about as accurate as 
a coin flip. A few rounds later, and 
I can safely say that the $10 I spent 
on my pool is no more, and such is 
the punishment for my illegal gam-
bling escapades — and also for my 
poor bracket choices.

Since I refuse to blame my own 

knowledge for my incorrect selec-
tions — because why would I ever 
do that — I’m choosing to blame 
math instead. Picking blindly from 
a field of 64 teams, there is roughly 
a one in 9.2 quintillion chance of 
picking a perfect bracket. That’s a 
really big number, and I’m forced to 
round it because the AP Stylebook 
probably doesn’t cover what to do 
with numbers that take three lines 
of text to print. If you really want-
ed to win a billion dollars, you’re 
better off trying to do it by play-

ing the Mega Millions lottery over 
and over instead of winning War-
ren Buffett’s perfect bracket chal-
lenge. Even according to the best of 
C-3P0’s calculations, picking a per-
fect bracket is two and a half qua-
drillion times more unlikely than 
navigating the asteroid field.

I know, I know, never tell you the 

odds. After all, a little bit of basket-
ball knowledge is better than blind 
picking, and there is the wealth of 
an entire Internet of statistics and 
research in your arsenal. FiveThir-
tyEight 
calculated 
its 
bracket 

predictions this year using every 
statistical source at their disposal, 
so surely they have a chance at get-
ting it right. And well, they do: by 
their estimations, they have a one in 
1,610,543,269 chance.

So, you’re telling me there’s a 

chance? Probably not. That friend 
in your pool who picked teams by 
the ferocity of their mascots and 
was sitting in a cool third place 
after the first round is proof enough 
— yes, University of Alabama at 
Birmingham Blazers, I’m look-
ing at your first-round upset and 
your dragon mascot. Meanwhile, 
the hour I spent looking up team 
research, log5 analyses and statis-
tics galore might as well have been 
spent watching Jimmy Fallon lip-
sync videos.

Yet it’s the same cruel element 

of chance that makes March Mad-
ness, well, mad. It’s looking up in 
the lecture hall and seeing all the 
computers throughout the audito-

rium watching Georgia Tech come 
back and upset Baylor. Excitement 
brought from the same mechan-
ics as picking a card from a deck 
or rolling the dice, realized in the 
extravagance of a sporting event. 
The numbers and formulas become 
irrelevant, replaced with the reality 
they tried to describe.

Chance is the drive of the thrill 

of everyday life. We’re all Charlie 
Bucket, asking, “I’ve got the same 
chance as anybody else, haven’t I?” 
Chance itself is the Golden Ticket, 
the device that takes the ordinary 
and gives it a chance to be extraor-
dinary. It takes the monotony and 
makes it into something undeter-
minable. Sometimes the only cer-
tainty is the existence of inevitable 
uncertainty, the anticipation of not 
knowing what lies behind the choc-
olate bar wrapper.

This principle of uncertainty 

governs everything around us, to 
the point where we conclude that 
Schrodinger’s cat is both alive and 
dead, and that’s somehow OK. You 
can continue spinning the wheel, 
around and around, knowing that 
in the moment you’re spinning it 
you are in control, and the moment 
you let go you relinquish it all. So 
you roll the dice, pick up whatever 
card is on top of the deck, pass Go, 
collect your $200 and go at it again.

Because all you really need is 
 

a chance.

FILM NOTEBOOK
Why ‘Vertigo’ is the 
best film of all time

Hichcock’s 

masterpiece is a 
complex vortex 
worth falling for

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

When I tell people “Vertigo” is 

my favorite film, their immediate 
reaction is to look at me like I’m 
the world’s most pretentious ass-
hole. They are probably right. As 
a film major and general purveyor 
of taste, I favor movies that are 
sublimely written and directed, 
and “Vertigo” is about as complex 
and masterful as film can get. It’s 
objectively perfect in every way, 
every flower and green neon sign 
and mirror hanging on the wall 
imbued with endless meaning and 
psychological underpinnings.

But none of this is why “Verti-

go” is my favorite movie. “Vertigo” 
is mostly analyzed as a collection 
of discrete parts — little pieces like 
a word or an image or a single sym-
bol. These elements are fascinat-
ing, and the technicalities alone 
are enough to merit being called 
the Greatest Film of All Time, but 
it’s the black reality buried under 
all the layers of analysis that make 
“Vertigo” so transcendent. It’s 
about deadly relationships; within 
the overblown and lurid story of 
Scottie and Madeleine is a devas-
tating truism about what it means 
to fall in love. “Vertigo” is about a 
man who can’t fucking get over a 
woman he fell for who didn’t recip-
rocate, and that man’s endless, 
tragic chasing of a girl who might 
come close to filling her shoes. The 
film speaks to the universalities of 
heartbreak, painting a portrait of 
deceitful and one-sided love in a 
way no other film could or has.

Scottie Ferguson spies her from 

across the bar at a restaurant. Clad 
in royal green and standing against 
a passionate red background, she 
is the most beautiful woman he’s 
ever seen. She is stunning, and I do 
not blame him for chasing her. But 
what Scottie doesn’t know is that 
the stunning Madeleine Elster he 
falls for is a construction. Gavin 
Elster, an old college friend of 
Scottie’s, hired a woman to imper-
sonate his wife in order to distract 
Scottie, to be a beautiful diversion 
to cover up Gavin’s premeditated 
murder of his actual wife. Mad-
eleine appears to be a sad case: 
She’s acting strangely, and she may 
be in danger of harming herself, so 
Gavin sets his buddy Scottie on the 
quest to save her life.

Though Scottie maintains his 

distance for most of the first half 
of the movie, and Madeleine’s gen-
erally aloof attitude keeps any of 
Scottie’s advances at bay, he falls 
for her while he’s a few feet away. 
Scottie is a former cop, with his 
heroism dimmed after a vertigo-
related failure on the job. He lives 
in an apartment with his friend 
Midge, who has always been more 
like a mother or a therapist than a 
romantic partner. In short, Scot-
tie is down on his luck, what a 

film scholar might call “symboli-
cally castrated” but which I’ll call 
just “sad and pathetic.” Madeleine 
could be the redemption act he’s 
looking for. If anyone is more hope-
less than Scottie, it’s this woman: 
She stands in a graveyard, stares 
lifelessly at a painting and wan-
ders through the city without any 
lucid information as to where she’s 
going. She senses some strange 
connection between herself and 
a painting in the museum, a lady 
who died too young and whose 
hair and accessory choices are 
uncannily similar to Madeleine’s 
own. Madeleine needs Scotty, or 
at least pretends to. With a look of 
helplessness in her eyes, she seems 
to say, “I’m your depressive pixie 
dream girl, and you’re the only guy 
who’s man enough to save me.”

Scottie doesn’t save her. In a 

fit of passion, Madeleine throws 
herself off a tower and falls to her 
death, forever out of Scottie’s life 
before he could marry her, fix her 
or fuck her. Scottie falls into a deep 
depression, the kind that can only 
be possible for men who lose the 
woman they love. He goes through 
the motions: He talks to Midge, 
goes to the flower shop, waits 
around the streets for his ephem-
eron of a woman to appear and 
tell him she’s sorry and she loves 
him and she didn’t mean to hurt 
him so. But while he’s standing 
there in front of the flower shop, 
Scottie spots a woman who looks 
mysteriously like his beloved Mad-
eleine. Well, not really. Her hair is 
darker, her eyebrows filled in and 
lips rouged; she is a vulgar and less 
refined version of Madeleine. Scot-
tie doesn’t care. He’ll make of her 
what he wants.

The last third of the film, when 

Scottie decides to mold Judy into 
this fiction of a woman, is one of 
the most tragic stories I’ve seen 
on film. The horror is detailed 
from both perspectives. Scottie is 
blinded by his unrequited love for 
Madeleine, a love that was impos-
sible from the start because she 
was a fiction. Judy inexplicably 
pines for Scottie, having fallen for 
him while playing the part of Mad-
eleine in the first half of the movie. 
But she knows he’ll never take her 
the way she is, the whole appeal 
of Madeleine was her coldness, 
distance and impossibility. Her 
only hope of catching his attention 
again is to let him dye her hair, pick 
out her clothes and transform her 
into the woman he really loves.

It’s agonizing to watch, because 

the film shoves your face into 
the tragedy and makes you feel 
every sting of each new gray gar-
ment and plucked eyebrow. It’s so 
affecting because this situation is 
all too common. To some degree, 
in order to find common ground 
for a relationship, you have to 
play Judy. You have to erode 
your edges, become a blank slate 
so the other person can project 
the person they need upon your 
empty, eager visage. You allow 
yourself to occupy the space of 
another woman and let someone 
construct you into what he wants 
and needs — until he remembers 
that you’re not her, and never will 
be. The most brutal feeling in the 
world is knowing that your own 
looks, interests and hobbies will 
never be enough for the person 
you love. They’ll always be chas-
ing the ghost of that ideal person 
they could never have. All that’s 
left to do is be the cool girl and 
wait for the inevitable fall.

“Vertigo” is so brilliant because 

it realizes that this situation is 
fucked for every party involved. 
Scottie is a pawn in Gavin Elster’s 
plot to murder the real Madeleine, 
a silly fool who was sucked into 
Judy’s vortex of lies. He loses 
every drop of composure and 
power associated with being a cop, 
or even just a man. Judy plays the 
role of another woman twice over, 
first impersonating Madeleine and 
watching the man she grew to love 
fall for this falsified version of her-
self. After Madeleine’s death, Judy 
lets her hair out of its knot and 
takes off the disguise, but only for 
a moment — Scottie takes her over, 
dresses her up again and promises 
his love only for this flat sketch of 
a woman. “Vertigo” is probably at 
the top of all those Greatest Film 
polls because of its narrative and 
symbolic complexity, but for me, 
the real marker of a great film is 
that gut punch of truth it delivers. 
Nothing can top “Vertigo.”

I know. I’m pretentious as hell. 

But please, try to find me another 
movie that comments this viscer-
ally about the tragic trickery of 
mismatched love. Please find me 
another movie so rich in cinemat-
ographic style that I could write 
another 1,000 words on its use of 
color alone. Collect your recom-
mendations. Email them to me. I’ll 
be the judge of whether they live 
up to “Vertigo” ’s delicious inscru-
tability and challenge, though I 
predict nothing will ever reach the 
heights of my true love.

Europe’s best dressed

STYLE NOTEBOOK

By MARIAM SHEIKH

Daily Arts Writer

I heard many different things 

before coming to Europe, spe-
cifically Italy. Watch out for 
the pickpocketers. Don’t talk 
to strangers. Be careful trav-
eling. Don’t walk around at 
night alone. So on and so forth. 
But perhaps the most repeated 
warning was to beware of Euro-
pean men. 

We’ve all heard the stereo-

types. They are in books, mov-
ies, songs, television, etc. I 
mean, I’ve seen the episode of 
“Full House” with Uncle Jesse’s 
(not so) distant relative Stavros 
from Greece. He was creepy. 
And OK, there are creepy Euro-
pean men lurking the streets 
catcalling and hissing (yup) 
at girls, but creepy people are 
everywhere. What’s not every-
where is men who look like they 

came straight out of a Gucci ad. 
You have to look at the glass 
half full and look at the posi-
tive, because the number of 
good-looking guys definitely 
outweighs the creeps.

Now I know some people 

antiquate “hipster” style with 
Goodwill and garage sales, but 
I associate it with an urban 
coffee-lover type of vibe, and so 
to me the European man is the 
original hipster. Before being 
hipster was even a term, before 
it got twisted into becoming an 
excuse to hate everyone, every-
thing mainstream and brand 
name soap.

Men here walk around with a 

certain vibe to them. They take 
care of their appearance but not 
in a vain or outrageous way, like 
an episode of “Jersey Shore.” 
They never look like they spent 
two hours perfecting their per-
fectly coiffed hair, but they prob-

ably did (how else can one attain 
that level of perfection?!). And 
their style is a unique expression 
of their character and personal-
ity. It’s also somewhat of a game. 
Young people our age in Italy 
are more than often still living 
with their parents, most of them 
won’t even move out and get jobs 
until their late 20s to early 30s. 
So the hot guy you see roaming 
the streets in his perfectly fitted 
suit with his perfectly coiffed 
hair, who basically looks like a 
million bucks, is probably home 
by 8:00 every night for his mam-
ma’s homemade pasta. 

Now, don’t get me wrong, 

there are still some guys around 
Europe who would never stand 
out in a crowd, speaking strictly 
in terms of fashion, of course. 
However, there’s just some-
thing about the European man 
that makes them far superior to 
any other.

ALBUM REVIEW
‘Jenny’ is damn good

By DANIEL SAFFRON

For The Daily

You know that spot on your 

knee that hurts when you push 
it? It’s not bruised or anything, 
but it hurts. 
You press on 
it anyway. You 
silently 
hope 

the pain’s not 
going be there 
on 
the 
next 

press, but it is 
and, somehow, 
you relish in 
the pain that you just wished 
wasn’t there. It’s not bad after 
all, the pain, but it’s noticeable. 
You begin to bargain with your-
self, once more, then you’re done, 
you tell yourself. You give it one 
last push, harder and more pain-
ful than all of the ones before. 
Of course you don’t stop push-
ing after the final push. Eventu-
ally you find yourself going from 
your spot-pushed knees to fetal 
position caught in a meta-exis-
tential crisis over why you can’t 
abide by evolution’s kindly-gift-
ed, longevity-producing aver-
sion to pain. This is Death Grips.

This March, Death Grips 

released the two disced, post-
humous album Powers That B, 
coming after their controversial 
disbandment-by-napkin-note in 
early July. Disc one, titled Nig-
gas on the Moon, was released 
for free download last summer 
and faced generally positive 
reviews. All of Niggas’s tracks 
feature vocal samples of Nor-
wegian musician Björk, an avid 
Death Grips fan. Her distinct 
voice loses its recognizability, 
but complements Death Grips’s 
experimental soundscape. Jenny 
Death, the second disc of Pow-
ers That B, is slightly longer 
than Niggas on the Moon, and 
definitely harnesses a differ-
ent energy. While Niggas on the 
Moon is heavily digital and rela-
tively calmed, to accommodate 
Björk’s vocals, Jenny Death is 
energetically voluminous and 
unexpectedly 
rock-influenced; 

Jenny is the stronger of the two. 
Death Grips’s rock-incorpora-
tive approach to this second disc 
proves to lend something inter-
esting to their sound. 

Jenny Death opens with previ-

ously released “I Break Mirrors 
With My Face In The United 
States.” A music video for “IBM-
WMYITUS” made its way to 
YouTube a couple days before the 
release of Jenny Death. The video, 
shot from the perspective of vari-
ous, instrument-mounted, fish-
eye cameras, fits the disorienting 
music well. The album starts in 
the expected Death Grips style: 
sledgehammer 
vocals, 
heavy 

handed drums and aggressive 
lawnmower synths. The implica-
tions of the track’s title are rather 
obvious, and repetitive lyrics 
intone the track’s theme. 

Moving on, “Inanimate Sen-

sation” begins with pitch-climb-
ing vocal samples that remind 

of the “Hustle Bones” intro. 
The vocal rhythms in the first 
verse are playfully sing-songy in 
the way a shotgun would sing a 
nursery rhyme and the inflamed 
synths throb along with a pulse. 
The song is full of pop culture 
references. In the last verse, MC 
Ride, the bands singer, referenc-
es Guns ‘n’ Roses frontmen, pos-
sibly relating Death Grip’s sound 
to “Axl Rose in a blender” and 
“Slash on Satan’s Fender,” fore-
shadowing rock ‘n’ roll themes 
that come to dominate the latter 
half of the disc. 

For a short while, “Turned 

Off” gives the listener time to 
cool off after “Inanimate Sen-
sation.” A tasteful, solo guitar 
opens the disc’s third track, 
but when the verse drops, Andy 
Morin 
(producer/keyboards) 

trades his lawnmower for a jet 
engine and Zach Hill (drums) 
whales on his crash cymbal. The 
aforementioned 
rock 
themes 

begin to surface in “Turned 
Off.” The first verse is perhaps 
the most interesting part of the 
song. It deviates away from rap’s 
overwhelming preference for 
a four four time signature and 
opts for a fatal six feel — a nice 
musical choice that intrigues the 
time signature savvy and also 
showcases the musicianship and 
versatility of the genre defying 
group. With a Yeezus-reminis-
cent vocal sample intro, “Why A 
Bitch Gotta Lie” picks up right 
where “Turned Off” ends. The 
two tracks seem to grapple with 
the similar musical ideas. 

“Pss Pss” and “Powers That 

B” backpedal along the Death 
Grips spectrum to find the 
familiar, 
vibrant, 
electronic 

wavelengths. Hill uses an elec-
tronic drumset in both tracks 
and Ride showcases the versa-
tility of his vocals, with a sinis-
ter, cynosural whisper during 
the chorus. The verses are rife 
with drug references; one verse 
poetically compares his lyrics to 
heroin: “These are my gold bars 
melted on spoons / My junk hits 
like martial law / You nod like 
true.” “Powers That B,” the title 
track, relates what appears to be 
a form of enlightenment that has 
come from Ride’s finding “the 
powers that b” — whatever they 
happened to “b.” The songs last 
verse blames the “bads” (mis-
fortunes) that come from crit-
ics’ expectations of the group 
and relates the “price tag” that 
comes with these so-called bads. 
Subtle compositional flourishes 
à la Andy Morin put the cherry 
atop of this Himalayan, sonic 
clusterfuck. 

“Beyond Alive” goes the wrong 

direction with the album’s new 
sound. A brow furling amalgam 
of sounds, “Beyond Alive” has 
vacuous System Of A Down style 
guitar riffs which clash with the 
track’s industrial components. 
Thankfully, track seven finds sal-
vation in the last 30 seconds’ brief 
electronic vignette. This break 
from chaos can even be described 

as beautiful — a Death Grip’s rar-
ity. Next, “Centuries Of Damn” 
does what “Beyond Alive” tries to 
do, but does it better. The guitar 
tracks in “Centuries Of Damn” 
provide a recurring melodic hook 
that sends the abused listener 
Blue Öyster Cult vibes and a 
much-needed melodic foothold.

“On GP” is far and away the 

strongest track on all of Powers 
That B. Like the group does on 
“Turned Off,” “On GP” makes 
use of time signatures uncom-
mon to rap. “On GP” (general 
principle) starts big with blar-
ing guitars, but eventually finds 
itself in many different places, 
all varying in energy. An inti-
mate ride cymbal and gloomy 
organ pads set the stage for the 
first verse, where Ride’s dark 
lyrics tell of a “nosy bitch” who 
notices Ride and wants to know 
what’s up with him. He tells 
her to “listen close,” because he 
just bought an “old black rope / 
Gonna learn how to tie it (and) 
hang (it) in (his) chamber.” The 
verse ends with the personifi-
cation of Death on Ride’s front 
porch, “itching to take (him).” 
Finally, Death hands Ride a 
weapon and “slurs, ‘use at your 
discretion, its been a pleasure, 
Stefan,’” referring to Ride by his 
given name. The verse is heart-
felt in a Death Grips kind of way; 
it’s about as touching as Death 
Grips 
gets. 
Considering 
the 

band’s recent decision to break 
up, these self-destructive words 
accrue some serious weight. The 
outro references the song’s title 
and continues to touch on Ride’s 
self-destructive tendencies: “All 
the nights I don’t die for you 
/ Wouldn’t believe how many 
nights I ain’t die for you on GP.” 
These provocative words sug-
gest that some general principle 
indoctrinated their break-up.

If Death Grips has been doing 

anything well lately, its been their 
incredible ability to piss people 
off. Their sudden disbandment, 
cancellation of future shows 
and no-show gigs have made the 
group pretty high on several peo-
ple’s shit lists. The final track’s 
title doesn’t help their cause, as 
it tempts us with a new version 
something we just lost. “Death 
Grips 2.0” is instrumental and 
jarring — a deviation from their 
usual industrial sound. Abandon-
ing all hip-hop influence, “Death 
Grips 2.0” sounds like something 
off Drukqs. 

Jenny Death is good. Damn 

good. While not likely to be their 
largest commercial success, it 
is innovative and conceptually 
dense. Jenny Death serves as 
something of a eulogy for the 
band, if the band does really stay 
broken up. The band will be tour-
ing this summer to promote the 
release of The Powers That B. 
All things considered, it is ques-
tionable as to whether or not 
The Powers That B will be Death 
Grips’s final album – I have 
strong doubts. If it is their last 
album, it’s a fine note to leave on.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
The timeless Sinatra

By CLAIRE WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

All girls dig a classy man.
It’s no lie. Bow ties, shiny 

shoes, fine wine and holding 
the door are the key to any girl’s 
heart. 

Frank Sinatra came into our 

world in 1915. Arguably Amer-
ica’s most romantic serenader, 
the chap is, indeed, the picture of 
“classy.” His look is a sharp one 
— suede coat and tie, all below a 
signature, charming grin. And 
let’s not forget the finishing 
touch: the hat. Guaranteed to 
melt the hearts of any sweetie 
in the mid 20th centrury, the 
Sinatra topper defines the man: 
handsome, sophisticated and 
indubitably audacious.

Despite this charm, modern 

pop stars reject Sinatra’s style, 
gripping the gazes of today’s 
teens with anything but class. 
Iggy Azalea beckons viewers in 
her music video “Fancy” with 
a precariously thigh-exposing 
mini-skirt and knee-high stock-
ings in a teasing schoolgirl 
seduction. Lil Wayne sports 

bright red short and full-body 
tattoos in his video for “A Milli.” 
“Burnin’ Up” features Jessie 
J, complete with golden talons 
and intentionally ripped sleeves, 
chewing a man’s ear between 
glossy purple lips — making 
everybody mildly uncomfort-
able. So, unless skimpy garb 
and chaotic hair have been 
recently proclaimed as sophis-
ticated wear, these stars are 
certainly evading even remote 
hints of intellect. Despite this, 
their fame is tremendous — fans 
across the world obsess over vid-
eos, play albums on repeat and 
flock to concerts. These guys are 
renowned, rocking looks that 
teens love. But will they last?

The song content of these 

recent artists begs the same 
question, as lyrics parallel the 
moderately trashy vibes of pop-
star dress. Today’s R&B and pop 
talk about a few core things — 
parties, sex, drugs and alcohol. 
Adam Levine recalls how “I get 
so high when I’m inside you,” as 
Miley Cyrus sings of “dancing 
with Molly,” and Flo Rida belts 
out his inflamed desires to take 

“a freak” home. It’s what teens 
want to talk about in this day 
and age.

Sinatra, however, rocks a dif-

ferent vibe. He sings of true, 
unadulterated romance rather 
than one-night lovers. “Lovely, 
don’t you ever change,” Sinatra 
sings out in the top hit, “Just the 
Way You Look Tonight.” “Fly 
Me to the Moon” (a personal 
favorite of mine — and everyone, 
let’s be real) captures listeners 
hearts with a smooth combina-
tion of vocals and jazzy instru-
mentals. It’s genuine passion, 
distant from the constant refer-
ences to curvaceous bodies and 
fickle fornication in today’s hits 
— and it never gets old.

Sinatra isn’t at the top of 

the charts. He’s not on the Top 
40, blasting from speakers or 
jammed out to by the collegiate 
body. This man beckons us with 
a different kind of allure, reject-
ing the hyper-sexualized, frat-
party, bass-drop heat of teenage 
pop and sporting a classic, 
romantic mood that’s everlast-
ing. This man is classic. Frank is 
still fresh.


and the school-city committee, 
which she joined in December 
2014.

Challenger Leaf said he is look-

ing for his first break into political 
office. After graduating from the 
University in 2012, the 24-year-old 
launched Neutral Skin and Hair, a 

company that produces and sells 
mineral sunscreen.

This bid for candidacy is not 

Leaf’s first run-in with Ann Arbor 
politics. When he was 18, he wrote 
a proposed ordinance to limit the 
city’s installation of police sur-
veillance cameras. In 2013 he was 
co-chair of the Mixed-Use Party, 
which ran University student 
candidates and focused on zoning 
reforms around the city.

“I’ve always been interested in 

politics and I hope to transition 
into being a politician,” Leaf said. 
“I like making policy, and to me 
that’s what’s interesting about pol-
itics. It’s the policy. It’s the power 
of legislation. And making rules 
and anticipating how they are 
going to affect people, and trying 
to make fair and good rules.”

Among Leaf’s priorities are 

increasing infrastructure, afford-

‘Orchard’ ponders 
existential queries

EVENT PREVIEW

Chekhov classic 
still relevant for 

21st-century 

audiences

By GRACE HAMILTON

Daily Arts Writer

Anton Chekhov’s “The Cherry 

Orchard” raises many questions 
for its audiences each perfor-
mance. But for 
millennials, per-
haps those ques-
tions are more 
existential.

“Every single 

day, we are met 
with this end-
less stream of 
horrible things 
in 
the 
world: 

Ebola, 
Fergu-

son, rights being 
taken away in 
Indiana,” 
said 

SMTD 
senior 

Ellie Todd. “But we also have 
BuzzFeed; we have cat pictures; 
we have The Next 21 Ways to Fry 
an Egg.” 

Todd is directing Anton Chek-

hov’s “The Cherry Orchard,” 
produced by student group Rude 
Mechanicals. So what do any of 
these millennial symptoms Todd 
describes have to do with Chek-
hov’s famous play? 

They represent forms of dis-

traction, forms of denial. Finding 
out, “What Pizza Topping Are 
You?” allows us to avoid confront-
ing other problems. This tendency 
to avoid difficult realities by con-
structing alternate realities was 
part of Russian early 20th century 
culture as well. 

The play follows widow Lyuba 

Ranevsky and her household as she 
comes to terms with the approach-
ing auction date of the family’s 
cherry orchard. Left with few other 
options for paying their debt, the 
orchard is ultimately sold to the son 
of a peasant, Yermolay Lopakhin. 

For a drama that is profoundly 

historical and locked in a unique 

time, its themes remain remarkably 
pertinent. Instead of BuzzFeed as 
distraction, the pervasive coping 
mechanism of the time was, simply, 
denial. 

“They are constantly going into 

town, spending money and lend-
ing money. If you are talking about 
selling the orchard, I’m gong to 
talk louder about whose smoking 
those cheap cigars over there,” 
Todd said describing the parallel. 

This production aims to draw 

out parallels like these by taking 
the play out of the time and place 
of 19th-century Russia. 

“The set is just trees and basi-

cally this bowl that’s painted like 
a giant tree ring. So we’re quite 
literally in one of the trees,” 
Todd said. “We’re going for a 
very timeless feel, our sound-
scape is ethereal and timeless 
and so are the costumes.”

There are other, deeper univer-

sal challenges of the human condi-
tion that the play explores. 

“At every level, there’s a 

microcosm of the macrocosm. 
There’s the issue of wealth and 
big social change, but the meta-
phors get smaller and smaller 
until you’re left with very human 
truths,” Todd said. “It’s about a 
feeling of value. At its very core, 
you can link all questions of 
wealth and status and such to a 
very simple feeling of fear. Fear 
that you are irrelevant.”

Lyuba’s relevance comes from 

the orchard. The prospect of its 
sale and destruction is about her 
own sense of losing standing in 
the world. The play is brilliant in 
its many petals of symbolism, held 
together neatly by lively charac-
ters and subtle comedy. 

Chekhov’s unique sense of 

comedy is something Todd found 
captivating as she continued her 
reading and research process. 
Although Chekhov’s work is 
often seen as gloomy and sad, the 
playwright himself had very dif-
ferent intentions. Todd recited a 
quote of his addressing this:

“You tell me that people cry at 

my plays. I’ve heard others say the 
same. But that’s not why I wrote 
them … All I wanted was to say 

truthfully to people: ‘Have a 
look at yourselves and see how 
bad and dreary your lives are!’ 
The important thing is that 
people should realize that, since 
when they do, they will most 
certainly create another, better 
life for themselves. And so long 
as this different life does not 
exist, I shall continue to say to 
people again and again: ‘Please 
understand that your life is bad 
and dreary.’ What is there to cry 
about in this?”

Amid the metaphor, scattered 

laughter and bits of tragedy, 
Chekhov’s ask is for self-reflection, 
as is Todd’s. 

“I can’t change everything 

in the world, but I can create 
something that will spark an idea 
in somebody’s mind. Success to me 
is that people in the audience go 
home and spend time in reflection, 
that the themes of the play inspire 
them to look at those themes in 
their own lives,” Todd said. 

With a cast of 14, teams of 

costume 
and 
set 
designers, 

producers through the Rude 
Mechanicals, Todd, and her 
assistant Wygodny (who acts in 
the play as well), it will be clear 
to audience members that an 
enormous amount of work went 
into the production, both on and 
off the stage. 

“Sometimes 
I 
think 
to 

myself, ‘I’ll just never be as 
smart 
as 
Chekhov,’” 
Todd 

said. 
Understanding 
the 

play in the first place takes a 
commitment. The production is 
an accomplishment. 

“The word that we feel the 

most is ‘devoted.’ A lot of people 
have passion, but the difference 
between a lot of people and 
those few that make amazing 
things is devotion. That’s what 
we’ve tried to be,” she said. “We 
eat, sleep and breathe the cherry 
orchard.” 

Tears? Laughter? Existential 

Crisis? It is hard to say what 
audience members will feel after 
“The Cherry Orchard.” What-
ever your reaction, prepare to 
set aside some time to figuring 
it out.

able housing, conserving forestry 
and making transportation easier 
for citizens of Ann Arbor. He also 
advocates for changing election 
dates, which he argues would 
allow more citizens to participate 
in elections, as many people are not 
in Ann Arbor in August when the 
Democratic primary happens.

Leaf acknowledged some of the 

disadvantages of running against an 
experienced candidate like Briere. 
He said he doesn’t know as many 
people and does not have the access 
to the city or media attention that 
Briere has.

However he believes he has a bet-

ter-articulated platform and clearer 
goals, and overall feels confident 

about his chances.

“I don’t get angry very easily. I 

think that is important. I am very 
level headed, even-tempered I 
think. I am very determined, very 
tenacious,” he said. “I think I criti-
cize myself and my own ideas and 
try to improve them that way. I ana-
lyze things to death and I think that 
is important on City Council right 
now.”

Briere said it’s easy for someone 

to have the kind of platform Leaf has 
when they do not know what it is 
like to be in government and found 
his approach to be much more black 
and white compared to her own 
nuanced style.

“Everybody has a personality 

trait,” she said. “I am extraordinari-
ly realistic. I am not idealistic at all. I 
probably never have been. Someone 
asked me recently what I thought 
about Will and I said, ‘You know, 
even if Will and I were the same age 
we would disagree on the way to get 
anything done.’ ”

Leaf does not believe Briere’s 

“black and white” evaluation of 
him to be true and added that 
City Council often avoids making 
hard decisions.

“There is a big difference 

between seeing both sides of 
an issue and listening and get-
ting lots of different perspec-
tives, which is critical and really 
important, to not having convic-
tions and not having an opinion,” 
he said. “To me, not taking action 
is itself an action.”

Leaf said he is aware that being 

elected would not garner him 
everyone’s support, but thinks 
that City Council members are 
able to frame discussions.

“I think it’s not just saying, 

like, ‘I’m going to be one vote on 
this pre-existing slate of issues.’ 
It’s that any individual on council 
is in a good position to frame the 
way the issues are,” he said.

An important point for both 

candidates is zoning reconsidera-
tions.

“I would love to see that we 

were making changes to our 
zoning to really encourage more 
solar alternative power by setting 
our premiums so that someone is 
expected to put a green roof or a 
solar roof on any building above a 
certain height,” Briere said.

She also called on the city to 

rezone certain sites in accor-
dance with the city’s master plan.

“The incentives were built into 

the zoning and now it’s time to 
reevaluate the incentives because 
they did not result in giving us the 
housing variety and other tan-
gibles like greener buildings and 
more pedestrian amenities that 
we had wanted.”

For Leaf, zoning is an issue 

that will directly affect another 
significant concern for the city: 
affordable housing.

Affordable housing and fos-

tering conditions for its devel-
opment in Ann Arbor have been 
recurring themes in this year’s 
City Council meetings.

City 
Council 
adopted 
the 

Housing 
Affordability 
Equity 

and Analysis, which proposes the 
construction of 3,139 affordable 
homes in Ann Arbor and 4,178 
new middles class homes in Ypsi-
lanti by 2035.

Leaf found the report to be 

unrealistic because of the costs 
associated with implementing 
the proposals. He added that 
affordable housing will have to be 
facilitated through market mech-
anisms, which the government 
can help create through zoning 
reforms.

He believes current zoning 

rules restrict the supply of hous-
ing, which leads to continually 
high prices. He said removing 
or reducing minimum lot sizes 
and eliminating parking require-
ments and floor area require-
ments would allow for more 
houses and therefore prices to 
drop.

Leaf 
recognized 
potential 

resistance 
against 
proposed 

changes and supports two ways 
to make it an easy transition. The 
first is to establish performance 
zoning, a type of zoning based on 
the effects of the development.

“One is to carefully regulate 

physical effects of developments 
like the noise, odor, light shin-
ing into houses and thing like 
that, and to focus more on per-
formance standards rather than 
zoning,” he said.

The second is changing the 

city’s Master Plan such that the 
planning commission could be 
able to allow property owners 
to opt in to mixed use neighbor-
hoods. This could be done in con-
cert with establishing effective 
buffer zones.

Briere also recognized the high 

levels of housing costs, including 
rising taxes and housing prices.

She said City Council is cur-

rently considering two options. 
One is to allow the creation of 
accessory dwelling units, which 
contain two units in a house, 
and the second is to decrease the 
frontage requirement to allow 
for the creation of duplex apart-
ments that would have the option 
of renting.

Briere identifies the problem 

of affordable housing as being 
regional, as it includes Ypsilanti 
and Ypsilanti Township, and 
thinks it should be addressed in 
that context.

“We talk about affordable 

housing in Ann Arbor,” she said. 
“But we really need to be address-
ing the income and race and 
opportunity and education divide 
between 
Ypsilanti, 
Ypsilanti 

Township and Pittsfield Town-
ship.”

Michigan ready for tough 
Big Ten weekend matchup

The Wolverines 

will play Minnesota 

for early-season 
bragging rights

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

If a wolverine and a gopher 

stood side to side, it would be 
easy to distinguish between 
the two. The 
wolverine 
is 

around 
the 

size 
of 
an 

average 
dog, 

possessing 
menacing 
teeth 
and 

sharp 
claws. 

The gopher is 
much smaller, 
with 
furry 

hide and long, 
narrow teeth.

But 
in 

regards to the fourth-ranked 
Wolverines and the 19th-ranked 
Golden Gophers softball teams, 
it’s much harder to pick out 
distinct differences. The teams 
are almost mirror images of one 
another. When Michigan heads 
to Minneapolis this weekend, 
it’ll be the most anticipated 
Big Ten softball series of the 
season.

The teams are first- and 

second-ranked in the Big Ten 
in hits, runs scored, slugging 
percentage, runs batted in, 
home runs and total bases. 
Michigan (5-1 Big Ten, 31-5 
overall) 
is 
first 
in 
every 

category, but Minnesota (5-1, 
29-5) isn’t too far behind. The 
Wolverines are also a little 
better in regards to pitching, 
boasting a 0.65 lower earned-
run average. They have allowed 
35 fewer runs and 32 fewer 
hits than the Golden Gophers. 
In fact, Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins said that Minnesota 
is essentially the same team as 

the Wolverines.

“This is a battle of who 

is 
mentally 
toughest, 
and 

regardless of what we talk 
about, you have all these people 
talking about the implications 
of 
this 
particular 
series,” 

Hutchins said. “I don’t see it 
that way. We could come out of 
there with no wins or all wins 
and we haven’t accomplished 
any of our goals yet. Our goal 
is just to play 
good softball 
against 
a 

good team.”

With 

some of the 
top talent in 
the country 
throughout 
its 
lineup, 

including 
junior 
second 
baseman Sierra Romero and 
sophomore 
right-hander 

Megan Betsa, Michigan’s star 
power is well known. Romero 
leads the Big Ten in nearly 
every major hitting category, 
having an astounding slugging 
percentage of 1.101 and an 
on-base percentage of .688. 
Betsa continues to mow down 
batters, 
having 
tallied 
143 

strikeouts to go with 14 wins.

The Golden Gophers may 

have 
the 
front-runner 
for 

Big Ten Player of the Year in 
pitcher Sara Groenewegen. The 
right-hander is arguably the 
most dominant pitcher in the 
Big Ten, racking up a league-
best 18 wins, 190 strikeouts and 
a .169 opposing batting average.

“We’re trying to get to 

contact better,” Hutchins said. 
“(Groenewegen) is a strikeout 
artist, so we gotta try to counter 
that.”

Groenewegen 
is 
also 

dangerous at the plate, twice 
compiling 11 total bases in a 
game. But Groenewegen isn’t 
Minnesota’s 
only 
standout. 

Infielder 
Tyler 
Walker 
is 

one of the best hitters in the 

Minnesota batting order, with 
33 runs scored, 40 RBI and nine 
home runs.

But 
Michigan 
hasn’t 

withered on the road this year, 
as home-field advantage hasn’t 
lived up to expectations in 
giving the team a leg up at all. If 
Michigan is perfect at anything 
so far, it’s raining on other 
teams’ parades.

The 
Wolverines 
are 

undefeated 
(11-0) in true 
away 
games 

— 
defeating 

top 
teams 

like 
No. 
10 

Arizona 
State, 

No. 5 Florida 
State and No. 
6 Alabama — 
accumulating 
the 
second-

most wins on 

the road in the country, trailing 
only Minnesota. Michigan has 
three losses on top of the two 
suffered at Alumni Field, but 
those losses have only come at 
neutral sites.

This 
weekend, 
the 

Wolverines will play the Golden 
Gophers in another tough away 
series, Minnesota’s first home 
series of the year. Michigan 
feels up to the task,

“I 
think 
we’re 
really 

prepared,” 
said 
freshman 

infielder Amanda Vargas. “It’s 
good that we’ve played a lot 
of harder games just for this 
exposure and for this type of 
weekend where we get to play 
Minnesota and compete.”

Added 
freshman 
catcher 

Aidan Falk: “We adapt really 
well, so it’s going to be fun to 
rise to the occasion. I’m really 
excited, and I think we’re going 
to fight really well out there.”

The 
wolverine 
may 
look 

much more intimidating than 
a gopher in nature. But this 
weekend, the question of who 
would win in a battle between 
a Gopher and a Wolverine has 
never been so uncertain.

“This is a 

battle of who 
is mentally 
toughest.”

‘M’ faces another test

By DANNY VARGOVICK

Daily Sports Writer

This weekend, the Michigan 

baseball 
team 
travels 
to 

Bloomington to take on the 
defending Big Ten champions.

It’s an important series for 

the Wolverines if they want to 
prove capable of realizing their 
goals of making 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament. 
After winning 
five 
of 
their 

last six games, 
which included 
taking 
the 

series 
against 

then-No. 
20 

Maryland, 
the 
preseason 

favorite 
in 

the 
Big 
Ten, 

Michigan will try to continue its 
momentum against the Hoosiers.

Last year, Indiana was a No. 1 

seed in the NCAA Tournament 
after reaching the College World 
Series in 2013. But the Hoosiers 
(1-4 Big Ten, 17-8 overall) might 
be having an off year.

They were just swept at Iowa 

last weekend, but they still have 
had a number of impressive wins 
in non-conference play. They 
opened the year winning two 
of three at Stanford, and have 
since swept Cal State Fullerton 
and beaten both Louisville and 
Kentucky.

But, perhaps more importantly, 

they have experience.

“They’re a tough team at 

home,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “They’ve got a lot of the 
veterans back from the teams 
from the last two years that went 
to the World Series. They lost 
a few, but they’ve got a nucleus 
back. They can certainly hold 
their own.”

Offensively, Indiana is No. 6 in 

the Big Ten in runs scored at 141, 
just 16 runs behind third-place 
Michigan.

The Hoosiers are led by first 

baseman Craig Dedelow, who 
leads the team in hitting at 
.330, and third baseman Austin 
Cangelosi, who leads the team in 
slugging at .545. Both were part-
time contributors last year, but 

have recently had the opportunity 
for more playing time this year 
with teammates graduating and 
leaving early for the MLB Draft.

Friday, Michigan (2-4, 16-12) 

will start junior right-hander 
Jacob Cronenworth, who started 
the season as the team’s closer but 
has moved to the rotation in part 
due to his effectiveness and in 
part due to injuries. Cronenworth 
has a 3.07 earned-run average on 
the year to go with a 0.89 WHIP.

Cronenworth will be going 

up against left-hander Caleb 
Baragar, arguably Indiana’s best 
pitcher, who has a 0.79 ERA on 
the season. In his last start, he 
went seven innings against Iowa, 
allowing only one run on four 
hits and a walk. Baragar should 
prove to be a challenge for the 
Wolverines.

Saturday 
and 
Sunday, 

Michigan will use freshman 
right-hander Ryan Nutof and 
sophomore 
left-hander 
Brett 

Adcock, 
respectively. 
Nutof 

earned Big Ten Co-Freshman of 
the Week honors for his start last 
week against Maryland where 
he went 7.1 innings, allowing five 
hits, one walk and no runs. The 

freshman, who sports a 2.92 ERA 
on the season, has pitched nine 
more innings than anyone else 
on the team and has recently cut 
down on his walks.

Finally, Adcock will start for 

the Wolverines in the final game 
of the series. Adcock is coming off 
a taxing start last weekend when 
he threw 95 pitches in just four 
innings due to a large number 
of walks and strikeouts, but he 
kept the Terrapins to just two 
runs over those four innings. He 
has been both Michigan’s best 
and worst starter at times this 
year. He has given up 28 walks 
and struck out 30 batters in 30.2 
innings this year.

This weekend series is another 

test in a long season of challenges 
for the Wolverines. It will be a 
good indicator of whether or not 
the Maryland series win was just 
a fluke or a true indicator of talent 
level.

Though 
Michigan 
and 

Indiana are trending in opposite 
directions, they appear to have a 
similar talent level.

“They’re a team that doesn’t 

beat themselves,” Bakich said. 
“It’s gonna be a good challenge.”

Wolverines routed by Wildcats

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Another 
ranked 
opponent 

lined 
up 
across 
from 
the 

Michigan 
women’s 
lacrosse 

team. 
It 
was 
the 
fourth 

opportunity for the Wolverines 
to prove themselves against 
a lacrosse powerhouse this 
season, but 
it 
became 

apparent 
early on that 
this game would be no different 
than the others.

No. 6 Northwestern removed 

all hopes of an upset, defeating 
Michigan (0-2 Big Ten, 5-6 
overall), 17-8, on Thursday.

The Wildcats (1-1, 7-3) quickly 

and consistently broke down the 
Wolverines’ defense throughout 
the 
first 
half, 
establishing 

position just outside the crease 
and 
punishing 
Michigan 

with a slew of goals. With 11 
minutes left in the first half, 
Northwestern put together a 
string of five unanswered goals 
to put the Wildcats up, 11-3.

Leading their scoring barrage 

was midfielder Selena Lasota, 
who tallied a total of six goals.

“Our only fault was that 

Northwestern had possession 
for most of the game,” said 
sophomore 
defender 
Brooke 

Pancoast. “So we were tired, 
naturally. 
(Clearing) 
is 

something that we have to 
work on as a team and that 
we will work on the next 
couple practices. We haven’t 
capitalized on turnovers, and 
we (need) to take care of the 
ball.”

Michigan didn’t do itself 

any favors, either, committing 
40 fouls, allowing five free-
position goals and allowing 
itself to be outshot, 32-13, in the 
game.

The 
Wolverines’ 
setbacks 

weren’t just on the defensive 
end. They struggled to possess 

the ball in their scoring third 
and never managed to claim a 
lead.

Northwestern 
perfectly 

executed a defensive trap in the 
first half, forcing 11 turnovers. 
But after the Wildcats removed 
the trap in the second half and 
replaced goalie Bridget Bianco 
with Brooke 
Jones, 
Michigan 
showed 
glimpses of 
offensive 
success.

“They 

were 
double-teaming 
the 

ball and getting out on the 
adjacents,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Jennifer Ulehla. “(With) 
that much pressure on us, we 
struggle. The best way to get 
shots off was in transition. In 
the second half, I think we were 

able to run more of our offense. 
We did a better job (breaking 
the trap) in the second half.”

When 
the 
Wolverines 

were able to run their offense 
effectively, 
there 
were 
rare 

glimpses of grace around the net.

With 23:11 left in the first 

half, after breaking the trap, 

sophomore 
attacker 
Jess 

Angerman 
received a pass 
left of the crease 
from sophomore 
attacker 
Tess 
Korten. 

Angerman then buried a shot 
into the net with a defender 
riding her left shoulder. Her 
goal was the first of Michigan’s 
eight goals.

The Wolverines’ offensive 

effort also featured four goals 
from 
sophomore 
midfielder 

Kim 
Coughlan. 
Sophomore 

midfielders Anna Schueler and 
Madeline Dion and sophomore 
attackman Lauren Oberlander 
contributed one goal each.

But 
unfortunately 
for 

Michigan, the Wildcats’ mantra 
for the night appeared to be 
“anything you can do, I can do 
better.” Though the Wolverines 
improved 
their 
scoring 

efficiency in the second half, 
scoring five goals on 10 shots, 
it simply wasn’t enough. With 
the exception of one pair of 
consecutive goals for Michigan, 
the Wildcats didn’t allow a 
single unanswered goal.

Thursday night began as an 

opportunity for the Wolverines 
to make a statement. But it ended 
much worse: a lopsided defeat, a 
third straight loss and another 
reminder that Michigan can’t 
keep up with ranked opponents.

Coughlan keeps 
racking up goals

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

It was a bittersweet night 

for sophomore midfielder Kim 
Coughlan 
as 
the 
Michigan 

women’s lacrosse team took on 
No. 6 Northwestern Thursday.

Despite Coughlan’s efficient 

four goals on four shots, her 
team fell 17-8 to the Wildcats.

The first half of the game gave 

no indication that Coughlan’s 
night would be anything out of 
the ordinary, though she did 
tally her first goal of the night 
and 23rd goal of the season with 
11:24 remaining in the first half, 
giving the Wolverines their 
third goal of the contest.

Given an eight-meter free-

position shot, Coughlin faked 
low and shot high to convert the 
open opportunity.

“Their defense in the first 

half was pretty hard to beat,” 
Coughlin said. “We just needed 
to see what they were doing 
and adjust to it. We started 
communicating more, spreading 
it out and passing the ball and 
moving it fast, that helped a lot, 
working as a team and seeing the 
open person right away.”

With 
Michigan 
trailing, 

11-3, at the end of the first half, 
Northwestern seemed to have 
the game well under control, 
though Coughlin did her best to 
make it difficult for the Wildcats.

Coughlan had back-to-back 

goals in the middle of the second 
half to complete her hat trick 
and slow down the four-goal run 
from Northwestern.

“Kim is one of our more 

explosive 
players,” 
said 

Michigan 
coach 
Jennifer 

Ulehla. “When they backed off 
of the double-teaming defense, 
that 
high-pressure 
defense, 

she was able to really use her 
athleticism.”

The first of the two came 

off another free-position shot 
where she once again faked out 
the goaltender and scored from 
eight meters out.

“We work a lot on (free-

position shots) in practice,” 
Coughlan 
said. 
“The 
more 

practice you get the better you 
get at them.”

Though Michigan had just 

three opportunities from the 
eight-meter all game, Coughlan’s 
two successful attempts made 
sure the Wolverines did not 
squander those advantages.

She created her next goal 

by dodging a Northwestern 
defender and giving herself 
enough space to get the shot off 
just in front of the crease.

Though the game was already 

in the bag for the Wildcats, 
Coughlan refused to give up, 
scoring for a fourth time with 
6:38 left in the game.

Creating space for herself, 

once more, she put one past 
the goalie while surrounded by 
Northwestern defenders.

“She 
is 
very 
explosive,” 

Ulehla said. “Whether or not 
she actually got the shot off or 
she ended up getting fouled and 
then scoring off of the eight-
meter, it just opened up more 
opportunities for her.”

Coughlan’s four goals bring 

her total on the season to 26, 
making her the Wolverines’ 
leading scorer.

She will look to take her 

momentum from this game and 
turn it into a win for her team 
this Saturday, when Michigan 
takes on Duquesne.

“She continues to get better 

every single game, and this was 
one of her best,” Ulehla said.

Harbaugh brings new excitement to Spring Game

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

Since Jim Harbaugh was hired 

as Michigan’s football coach 

Dec. 30, there has been constant 
excitement surrounding his every 
action.

There he was one day, helping 

two women after a car crash. 

There he was on another, coaching 
first 
base 
for 
the 
Oakland 

Athletics. Even 
his 
presence 

online 
has 

been a point of 
captivation 
— 

Harbaugh has 
amassed more 
than 
200,000 

followers 
on 

Twitter 
in 

less than four 
months.

But Saturday 

will 
be 
the 

first time that 
attention will be turned to the 
football field, when Harbaugh will 
coach Michigan’s Spring Game. 
With his arrival, the excitement 
for the game around campus is 
more palpable than in years past.

Associate Athletic Director 

Dave 
Ablauf 
estimated 
that 

there could be between 35,000 
and 50,000 fans in attendance 
depending upon the weather, a 
sizable increase from the 15,000 
fans who attended last year’s 
Spring Game. Ablauf said a crowd 
of 75,000 fans wasn’t out of the 
realm of possibility. That can be 
attributed to Harbaugh.

Even 
Michigan’s 
students, 

known 
for 
their 
relative 

indifference toward attending 
football games in recent years, 
have made the game a point 
of 
discussion 
on 
campus. 

Fraternities 
have 
planned 

tailgates for the morning of 
the game, and talk on campus 
indicates that the Spring Game 
could overtake the annual city-
wide 
marijuana 
celebration, 

known as “Hash Bash,” as the 
go-to weekend event for students.

The format of the Spring Game 

will only help matters. In recent 
years, the game has served as little 
more than an opportunity for the 
public to watch the team practice. 
Last season, the team spent a 
large portion of the afternoon 
warming up and running drills 
that were not reminiscent of a 
football game. That won’t be the 
case Saturday.

The Wolverines will play four 

10-minute quarters of football. 
Last Saturday, Harbaugh held a 
draft to determine rosters for the 
game. Michigan’s players will be 
split up into two teams, one maize 
and the other blue. Defensive 
coordinator and linebackers coach 
D.J. Durkin drafted and will coach 
the maize team, while offensive 
coordinator and offensive line 
coach Tim Drevno will have the 
same role for the blue team.

The 
Athletic 
Department 

released the rosters Wednesday 
afternoon, though the order the 
players were picked is unknown. 
The main point of interest for fans 
in attendance will likely be the 
quarterback battle. The returning 
quarterbacks have seen little game 
action, and Saturday could provide 
a glimpse into their development.

As 
expected, 
the 
three 

scholarship 
quarterbacks 
on 

the spring roster were split up 
between the teams. Early enrollee 
Alex Malzone is a member of the 
maize team, while junior Shane 
Morris and redshirt freshman 

Wilton Speight will play for 
the blue team. Members of the 
coaching staff have claimed on 
numerous occasions throughout 
the spring that no quarterback 
has separated himself from the 
rest of the group by a margin 
worthy of the starting job.

The Spring Game will be the 

last opportunity for the trio of 
quarterbacks 
to 
impress 
the 

coaching staff on the field until 
new 
competition 
arrives 
on 

campus over the summer. ESPN 
reported Wednesday that Iowa 
graduate transfer Jake Rudock 
plans to enroll at Michigan and 
play for the Wolverines in the fall. 
Rudock was a two-year starter 
for the Hawkeyes, and threw for 
2,436 yards last season to go along 
with 16 touchdowns and five 
interceptions.

Also arriving on campus this 

summer will be highly touted 
prospect Zach Gentry, a four-
star recruit from New Mexico. 
Participating in spring practice 
won’t be a prerequisite for 
winning the starting job. Drevno 

believes practicing in fall camp 
will give the newcomers enough 
time to come in and potentially 
earn a starting role, even at the 
game’s most important position.

Other 
Michigan 
players 

possibly competing for time were 
not listed on the Spring Game 
roster, perhaps the result of 
injury. This group includes junior 
linebacker Mike McCray, senior 
linebacker James Ross III, junior 
defensive end Taco Charlton, 
senior 
running 
back 
Drake 

Johnson, senior fullback Sione 
Houma, senior defensive end 
Mario Ojemudia, senior defensive 
tackle Ondre Pipkins and junior 
tight end Khalid Hill.

Despite the division of the 

Wolverines’ 
squad, 
Drevno 

laughed when asked if there would 
be trash-talking between him and 
Durkin. He said there wouldn’t be. 
Still, a victory will be his goal.

“We’re competitive, which is 

fun,” Drevno said.

For the first time in recent 

memory, the Spring Game could 
be, too.
