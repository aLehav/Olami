MICHIGAN FOOT ALL
Wolverines
to play in
Gator Bowl
Michigan will face Mississippi
State on New Year's Day in first
bowl appearance in three seasons
By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
The decision was unanimous by the Gator Bowl
selection committee: Michigan was extended an
invitation yesterday to play in the afternoon New
Year's Day bowl against No. 21 Mississippi State.
It will be the first-ever meeting between the two
teams.
Even though the Wolverines finished the regular
season with two losses at the hands of No. 4 Wiscon-
sin and No. 6 Ohio State and a 7-5 record, Gator Bowl
President Rick Catlett and his committee liked the
matchup between these Big Ten and Southeastern
Conference schools.
"We're excited about (Michigan's) ability to move
the ball offensively," Catlett said in a phone inter-
view with The Michigan Daily yesterday. "And we
think Mississippi State plays really good defense. I
think it's going to be a classic college matchup."
Added Michigan Athletic Director Dave Brandon
via a press release: "We are excited about represent-
ing the Big Ten Conference in the Gator Bowl. Our
players, coaches and football support staff have
worked hard all season and this is a great reward for
them. We have great alumni and fan support in the
Sunshine State and I anticipate a large Michigan con-
tingent in Jacksonville.
The Wolverines are headed to a bowl game for the
first time in the three seasons Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez has led the program. And it's a New Year's
Day bowl nonetheless.
Before the two-year drought, Michigan had made
33 straight bowl appearances and was a fixture on
New Year's Day. The school's rich tradition played a
factor in selecting the Wolverines over both Illinois

LSA-SG -makes push for Blue Bucks
optionat restaurants near campu s

LSA-SG president:
Similar colleges have
extensive programs
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
Students may not need to reach
for cash anymore at off-campus eat-
eries if the LSA Student Government
gets its way.
LSA-SG President Steven Benson
said the organization is trying to get

the University to expand its Blue
Bucks program so that the curren-
cy associated with University meal
plans is accepted at local off-campus
restaurants. Benson said the orga-
nization decided to make the push
after approximately 66 percent of
students who answered a poll ques-
tion on the'LSA-SG ballot said they
would eat at off-campus establish-
ments at least one more time a week
if they accepted Blue Bucks.
In a viewpoint printed in The
Michigan Daily last month, Benson,
along with LSA-SG Vice President

Carly Goldberg and LSA-SG Student
Life Committee Chair Caroline Can-
ning, encouraged students to vote
in favor of expanding Blue Bucks to
off-campus eateries.
In the piece, Benson, Goldberg,
and Canning wrote that because
dining halls are closed Saturday
nights, they want students to have
more choices as to where they could
use Blue Bucks.
LSA-SG got the initial idea for the
campaign after an executive trip
during the University's fall break
to Ohio State University, Cleveland

State University and the University
of Akron, Benson said.
Every university the group visited
had a similar program to the Blue
Bucks program and Benson said the
programs at all three university also
allowed students to use their Blue
Bucks equivalent at off-campus eat-
eries.
Benson added that because OSU
has successfully implemented an
off-campus meal program, the Uni-
versity should be able to sustain a
similar plan.

A2 Council, DDA working to shift
burden for parking administration

The upside of honesty: Experts say 'U'
error policy shown to drop claims costs

If passed, DDA
would be responsible
for setting rates
* By JORDAN STEIGER
For the Daily
The Ann Arbor City Council
and the Downtown Development
Authority are working together

to develop a proposal to transfer
decision-making responsibility
regarding parking in downtown
Ann Arbor from City Council to
the DDA.
Though officials have already
drafted the proposal, they
haven't taken any further action
to put the plan into effect.
In crafting the proposal, City
Council proposes transferring
its power to enforce parking

decisions - like setting rates
and enforcement hours - to the
DDA.
The proposal stems from a
2005 agreement between the
DDA and City Council in which
the DDA gave $10 million to
the city over a span of 10 years
to fund parking enforcement.
However, city officials say they
no longer have sufficient fund-

UMHS program
encourages doctors
to admit mistakes
to patients
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily StaffReporter
Instead of keeping quiet, Uni-
versity doctors are encouraged to

inform patients of medical errors
thanks to a University of Michigan
Health System program that will
soon celebrate its tenth anniver-
sary.
The program, which encour-
ages all hospital employees to pro-
actively look for medical mistakes,
began in 2001 because of the work
of Richard Boothman, the chief
risk officer of UMHS.
After looking though years of
medical files and concluding that

honesty is vital to the future of
medicine, Boothman said he real-
ized the University hospital would
be a perfect place to start a pro-
gram.
"I didn't bring ethics to this
place. It was always a highly ethi-
cal place," said Boothman, refer-
ring to UMHS.
The goals of the program are to
keep patients safe and help doctors
address errors instead of firing

California gay marriage foes
plan on win in second round

Prop. 8 advocates
have difficulty
defending position
in first federal trial
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The
defenders of California's gay
marriage ban took a pummeling
during the first federal trial to
explore the civil rights implica-
tions of outlawing same-sex mar-
riages. They summoned only two
witnesses, one of whom left the
stand looking thrashed. Even the
lead attorney was left groping for
words when pressed to explain
how allowing gays and lesbians to
wed would undermine traditional
unions.
If the courtroom had been a
boxing ring, the referee would
have called a knockout.
Yet lawyers for the ban's spon-
sors say their side was on the
ropes for a reason: They disputed
that live testimony and reams of
evidence were relevant to a law-
suit against the voter-approved
Proposition 8, so they did not pro-
vide it. In their view, the proceed-
ings were a "a show trial," and
they were willing to invite the
unfavorable verdict they eventu-
ally got while betting they would
win in a later round where the
ground rules would be different.
"Something that has been lost
sight of is who has the burden
of proof in this case," Andrew
Pugno, a lawyer for Proposition
8's sponsors, said at the 13-day-
long trial's close. "The burden
is not on the defendants and the
people who voted for Prop 8."
That strategy's wisdom will be
put to its first test today, when a
federal appeals court is set to hear
arguments in Perry v. Schwar-
zenegger, the landmark con-
stitutional challenge to the gay
marriage ban. The coalition of
religious and conservative groups
that won Proposition 8's passage
two years ago has asked the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to
reverse the San Francisco judge
who pointed to their "rather lim-
ited factual presentation" when
he struck down the measure.
Despite the lopsided trial
record, most legal experts agree

the defense team's reasoning
is not far-fetched. They say the
three-judge panel could discount
the exhaustive trial evidence that
Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn
Walker laid out in his August
decision. In its place, the panel
could substitute studies that were
barely discussed in Walker's court
or, more likely, its own interpreta-
tion of relevant case law.
"I can't say whether the case
was litigated well or badly," said
Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law
school professor whose popular
legal-affairs blog was inundated
with comments from observ-
ers critical of the defense's trial
performance. "If the question is
whether they should have intro-
duced more witnesses at trial, I'm
skeptical it would have done any
good. It certainly wasn't neces-
sary, and I'm not sure it would
have been at all helpful."
Proposition 8's support-
ers maintain Walker erred by
employing "standard courtroom
fact-finding" to a case that, unlike
a criminal trial where a singu-
lar event is in dispute, hinged on
broader questions of policy, tradi-
tion and legal precedent.
"The district court based its
findings almost exclusively on
an uncritical acceptance of the
evidence submitted by plain-
tiffs' experts, and simply ignored
virtually everything - judicial
authority, the works of eminent
scholars past and present in all
relevant academic fields, exten-
sive historical and documentary
evidence - that ran counter to its
conclusions," they wrote in their
opening brief.
They also are hoping to per-
suade the appeals court panel that
the lower court judge improperly
demanded proof for their claim
that permitting same-sex mar-
riages would undermine mar-
riage's "central animating societal
purpose" of promoting responsi-
ble childbearing among men and
women.
University of Pittsburgh law
school professor Arthur Hellman
said the stakes for gay marriage
opponents rose this week with
the random selection of three
judges to hear the appeal. Two
are Democratic appointees, one
among the court's most liberal

members.
Even if they affirm Walker's
ruling, Hellman said the appellate
judges are unlikely to do so simply
because the plaintiffs presented
17 witnesses compared with the
two defense witnesses.
"It is unlikely the court would
consider itself bound and limited
by what happened in the district
court, that it could not go beyond
the trial record," he said.
Walker made it clear he planned
to assess the validity of hotly
debated questions surrounding
same-sex marriage based on what
he heard in his courtroom. Are
laws limiting marriage to a man
and a woman based on prejudice
or religion? How does denying
gays and lesbians the right to wed
affect children? Do people choose
their sexual orientations?
Lawyers for the two same-sex
couples who sued to overturn
Proposition 8 offered testimony
from the couples, political scien-
tists, psychologists, a man who
had been forced to undergo
unsuccessfully therapy to become
heterosexual and a Proposition 8
supporter summoned as a hostile
witness.
The defense cross-examined
those witnesses at length and
introduced studies intended to
undercut their accounts. But their
witness list consisted of a politi-
cal scientist who Walker later
concluded was not an expert in
gay and lesbian issues and a self-
educated scholar on fatherhood
whose opinions the judge dis-
missed.
Boston University family law
professor Linda McClain said she
thinks the decision "not to put on
much of an evidentiary case" was
an "imprudent litigation strategy."
McClain nonetheless notes
that it would only take persuading
two of the panel's members that
Walker was wrong in concluding
that marriage is a fundamental
right under the U.S. Constitution
for Proposition 8 to be preserved.
If the 9th Circuit ends up agree-
ing that Proposition 8 is unconsti-
tutional, the U.S. Supreme Court
is expected to step into the case.
"In theory, basic rules on
appeal would be the reviewing
court should be very deferential
to the trial court," she said.

Cuban President Rau Castro lights a Hanukkah candle last night during a ceremnony at a synagogue in Havana, Cuba.
President Castro celebrates
M E a
Hanukah ith ubanJew

Raul Castro dons
yarmulke, lights
candles in support
HAVANA (AP) - President
Raul Castro celebrated Hanuk-
kah yesterday with Cuba's tiny
Jewish community, a heavily
symbolic act at a time when his
government is holding a Jewish-
American subcontractor on sus-
picion of spying.
Neither Castro nor those
assembled at Havana's Shalom
synagogue mentioned the name
Alan Gross during the gather-
ing, which was broadcast on the
state-television newscast yester-
day evening. But Gross's one-year
detention without charge was the
elephant in the room.
The U.S. government says
Gross was in Cuba as part of a
USAID program to distribute
communications equipment to
the island's 1,500-strong Jewish
community, and both the State
Department and Gross's wife,
Judy, made fresh appeals this
week for his release. The lead-
ers of Havana's two main Jewish
groups have denied having any-
thing to do with him.

Castro wore a suit and a yar-
mulke, the head covering which
observant Jews wear as a symbol
of their deference to God, and
was given the honor of lighting
the first candle of the menorah.
It was the first time in more than
a decade that either Castro or his
brother Fidel appeared with the
Jewish community at a religious
celebration like Hanukkah.
The brothers have gone out of
their way to show their support
for the Jewish people in recent
months.
Fidel Castro took time out from
his warnings about a looming
nuclear war pitting the U.S and
Israel against Iran to say that he
disagreed with Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's denials
of the Holocaust. He said: "I don't
think anyone has been slandered
more than the Jews" adding that
Jews "were expelled from their
land, persecuted and mistreated
all over the world."
The comments won rare praise
from Israeli President Shimon
Peres and Prime Minister Benja-
min Netanyahu.
Raul Castro, who took over
the presidency from his brother
in 2006, thanked his hosts for a
"very enjoyable afternoon," and

said he hoped to have more time
on another occasion to come and
talk about "the Hebrew commu-
nity in Cuba and the fabulous his-
tory of the Hebrew people."
Castro noted that he will turn
80 in June, but said he was "in
good health." He said he was
pleased that his country had
begun to hold discussions on the
need for a major economic over-
haul. Cuba has announced that it
is laying off 500,000 state work-
ers, while allowing for more pri-
vate enterprise.
Gross, a native of Potomac,
Maryland, was arrested Dec. 3,
2009. His family denies he was
spying, saying he brought com-
munications equipment for use by
the local Jewish community, not
dissidents. The U.S. government
says his continued detention is a
"major impediment" to improved
ties between the two Cold War
enemies.
Hanukkah is the Festival of
Lights for Jews. The holiday com-
memorates the rededication of
the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem
in 164 B.C. According to tradi-
tion, a candelabra was lit with
only enough oil for one day, but
it miraculously burned for eight
days.

MENOMINEE, Mich.
Memorial held in
Mich. school for
Wisconsin shooter
Hundreds of people showed
up yesterday for a memorial to a
15-year-old Wisconsin boy who
held his social studies class hostage
before shooting himself last week,
setting aside the terrifying stand-
off to honor him as a quiet, helpful
leader who loved the outdoors.
Sam Hengel's family held the
gathering in a school auditorium
in Menominee, Mich., because
they expected so many support-
ers. Menominee lies just across the
Menominee River from Marinette,
" Wis., where Hengel held 26 class-
mates and his teacher at gunpoint
for nearly six hours.
Barb Post of Marinette, Wis., said
she didn't know Hengel's family but
attended anyway to show support.
"You care about the people and
the family, and you understand it
could happen to anybody," Post said.
Why Hengel took his class hos-
tage remains a mystery. Other stu-
dents and his teacher have said
he was well-liked and had many
friends.
The standoff last Monday at
Marinette High School began when
Hengel returned to his sixth-hour

23 protected seals
clubbed to death
New Zealand police and con-
servation officials are hunting
offenders who clubbed to death 23
protected fur seals, including new-
born pups.
Conservation Minister Kate
Wilkinson said Monday some of
the eight bludgeoned pups were
just days old when they were killed.
She's "beyond appalled" over the
deliberate and abhorrent attacks.
Wilkinson appealed for public
W help to find those responsible.
The attacks involved the Ohau
Point seal colony on northern South
Island and is north of the town of
Kaikoura - an international whale-
watching center.
The conditions of the carcasses
suggest the attacks took place over
two weeks.

N.Y. bust. uncovers Rx
,drugs going to ealers

33 medical patients
charged with selling
pills to dealers
BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Ethel
Johnson couldn't get her pre-
scription for pain medication
filled fast enough. The 60-year-
old Buffalo woman was hurt-
ing - but investigators say that
wasn't the reason for the rush.
According to secretly record-
ed telephone conversations, the
sooner Johnson could pick up
her pills, the more quickly she
could sell them to her dealer.
Her pain pills were destined for
the street.
Johnson is among 33 people
charged so far in a large-scale
investigation that has opened a
window into an emerging class
of suppliers in the illicit drug
trade: medical patients, includ-
ing many who rely on the pub-
licly funded Medicaid program
to pay for their appointments
and prescriptions. She has
pleaded not guilty.
For the first time, the Buffalo
investigators devoted the kinds
of resources normally aimed at
street drugs like heroin or crack
- wiretaps, buys, surveillance
and cross-agency cooperation
to trace the drugs from phar-
macy to street. Even they were
taken aback by the burgeoning
market for the kinds of pills
found in medicine cabinets in
typical American homes.
"I have to admit we were
sort of surprised at how big
this had become," said Charles
Tomaszewski, former supervi-
sor of the DEA office. "The sub-
urbs, the city, there was no area
that wasn't touched by this."
Often at no charge, the
patients see a doctor, or sev-
eral doctors, and come away
with prescriptions for narcotic
OxyContin and other pills they
then sell to a dealer for as much
as $1,000. If they are on Medic-
aid, the program is billed about
$1,060 for a typical 60-pill,

80-mg prescription, along with
the $23-to-$39 cost of the doc-
tor's visit.
"These patients, in essence,
become the source for the
drugs," said Dale Kasprzyk, act-
ing head of the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration in Buffalo.
"This is a lucrative under-
ground business for people," he
said.
A report last year by the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office
estimated that 65,000 Medicaid
beneficiaries in New York and
four other states had visited six
or more doctors in fiscal 2006
and 2007 to acquire duplicate
prescriptions for controlled
substances.
The cost to Medicaid was
$63 million for the drugs alone,
excluding doctors' exams. The
report examined Medicaid
abuse in New York, Califor-
nia, Illinois, North Carolina
and Texas, high-volume states
in Medicaid prescription drug
payments.
OxyContin, a time-release
formulation of oxycodone,
packs 12 hours' worth of pain
relief into one tablet. It is espe-
cially prized by drug abusers,
authorities say, because it can
be crushed and ingested, snort-
ed or injected for the full nar-
cotic impact, a heroin-like rush.
The criminal cases brought in
July by U.S. Attorney William
Hochul's office in Buffalo illus-
trate how patients are coached
about which doctors to see and
what to say when they get there.
Prosecutors, in November court
filings, said plea agreements are
being negotiated.
"Tell him, you know, you
know you've been in a lot of
pain, your throat is complain-
ing. And then, you know, even
throw a little of that stress on
about your baby," alleged Buf-
falo kingpin Michael McCall
instructs a 40-year-old patient-
supplier in a conversation
recorded by investigators.
"You need to tell doctor you
need to go up to 90 (pills) 'cause

...you've been taking three a day
and you ran out earlier," he says.
When another patient, a
60-year-old woman, tells
McCall a doctor is insisting on
a urine test to be sure she's tak-
ing the prescribed medication,
McCall responds: "You want
some?" and offers to bring the
urine to her home.
Dealers "don't have to get
their money together, smuggle
or reach out to connections
in Mexico or anything," said
Tomaszewski, who helped
oversee the Buffalo crackdown
before becoming the city's dep-
uty police commissioner. "They
were clever enough to find the
sources of supply were in their
own neighborhood."
After buying the pills from
patients, dealers resell them for
an average of $1 a milligram,
investigators say. With a single
80-mg OxyContin selling for
$80, the 90-count bottle of pills
McCall allegedly paid $1,000 or
less for was worth $7,200 on the
street. Authorities say he would
meet his'suppliers in pharmacy
parking lots or pick up the pills
at their homes - even getting
some patients' prescriptions
filled himself, signing for them
at the pharmacy.
After OxyContin was intro-
duced in 1996, it quickly became
the top prescribed painkiller
in the nation, and among the
most abused. The Food and
Drug Administration in April
approved a new version of
the painkiller with a coating
designed to make the drug hard-
er to crush and snort or inject.
States have cracked down, as
well, with New York and others
adopting tamperproof prescrip-
tion pads.
To curtail abuse by Medicaid
patients, several states, includ-
ing Alaska, Florida, Maine,
Ohio, South Carolina and West
Virginia, require state approval
before OxyContin prescrip-
tions are filled, according to the
National Conference of State
Legislatures.

Harris County has
sent 286 convicts to
death row since 1982
HOUSTON (AP) - In the
deeply Republican state that has
executed more convicts than any
other and the county that has sent
the most to death row, an unusual
legal proceeding will begin this
week: A Democratic judge will
hold a lengthy hearing on the con-
stitutionality of the death penalty
in Texas.
State District Judge Kevin
Fine surprised many Texans last
spring when he granted what is
usually a routine and typically
rejected defense motion and ruled
the death penalty unconstitution-
al. His ruling came in the case
of John Edward Green Jr., who
is awaiting trial on charges he
fatally shot a Houston woman and
wounded her sister during a June
2008 robbery.
Followinga torrent of criticism
from Republican Gov. Rick Perry
and other Texans, Fine clarified
his ruling, saying the procedures
the state follows in getting a death
sentence are unconstitutional.
Then Fine rescinded his ruling
and ordered the hearing, which
starts today, saying he needed
more information before making
a final decision.
Most Texans consider the
death penalty a fitting pun-
ishment for the worst kind of
crimes, and Harris County, which
includes the state's largest city,
Houston, has sent more inmates
to the lethal-injection gurney
than any other in Texas. But, anti-
death penalty activists have cre-
ated serious doubt recently about
whether two men were wrongly
executed.
Fine is an unusual Houston
jurist: a Democrat who sports
dense tattoos and has said he's a
recovering alcoholic and former
cocaine user.
He declined to be interviewed
for this story, but he's said that
he's taken notice of recent death
row exonerations and his ruling
will "boil down to whether or not
an innocent person has actually
been executed."
But Fine also has said he has no
personal interest in the death pen-
alty, he believes the death penalty
is constitutional and the hearing
will be limited to issues related
to Green's case. The hearing,
which could last up to two weeks,
is expected to include testimony
that Green's attorneys say will
show how flaws in such things as
eyewitness identification, confes-
sions and forensic evidence have
led to wrongful convictions.
Green's attorneys say the hear-
ing is not a referendum on wheth-
er Texas should have a death
penalty.
"We don't say a state doesn't
have the right to have a death
penalty," attorney Casey Keirnan

said. "We're saying the way we
do it in Texas under our statute is
unconstitutional."
The debate over possible
wrongful executions in Texas
has been fueled by the cases of
Cameron Todd Willingham and
Claude Jones.
Willingham was put to death
in 2004 after being convicted of
burning down his home in Corsi-
canain 1991 and killinghis 2-year-
old daughter and 1-year-old twins.
His execution has been ques-
tioned since several fire experts
found serious fault in the arson
findings that led to his conviction.
Jones was convicted inthe 1989
killing of a liquor store owner
during a robbery near Point
Blank, about 75 miles north of
Houston. His 2000 execution was
called into question after a new
DNA test showed a hair that had
been the only piece of physical
evidence linking him to the crime
scene didn't belongto him.
Green's attorneys say they
plan to bring up the Willngham
and Jones cases at the hear-
ing. They claim the state's death
penalty procedures violate the
Eighth Amendment right to free-
dom from cruel and unusual pun-
ishment because they create a
"substantial risk" that innocent
people are wrongfully convicted
and sentenced to death.
Harris County prosecutors,
who unsuccessfully tried to get
Fine removed from the case,
declined to comment before
today's hearing. But in a peti-
tion filed last month, they asked
the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals to stop the hearing, say-
ing Fine doesn't have the author-
ity to declare the state's death
penalty law unconstitutional and
higher courts, including the U.S.
Supreme Court, have previously
rejected Eighth Amendment chal-
lenges to capital punishment.
Prosecutors said Fine has
shown "antagonism against the
death penalty" and a jury should
decide Green's fate.
The appeals court is dominat-
ed by Republicans and led by a
chief judge who was disciplined
for closing the court promptly at
5 p.m. while a death row inmate
tried unsuccessfully to file an
appeal hours before he was exe-
cuted. But it denied the prosecu-
tion's motion, saying it couldn't
act until Fine ruled.
Anti-death penalty groups
have lauded Fine, while those in
favor of capital punishment call
him misguided.
"It's appropriate that a Har-
ris County judge is stepping up
and saying we need to take a time
out and look at the system," said
Scott Cobb, president of the Texas
Moratorium Network, a group
that advocates for a suspension of
executions in the state.
Harris County has sentenced
286 people to death since Texas
resumed executions in 1982, and
115 of those have been executed.

U.K. Parliament assistant
Qoruc~r. kJ]P R J

u%, U 1.x.0 %. u V p1"%-/ 1.16 1 WI

Aide worked with
lawmaker for more
than two years
LONDON (AP) - A member of
the House of Commons Defense
Committee said yesterday that
his Russian assistant is facing
deportation as a suspected spy.
Mike Hancock said he was
unaware that the security ser-
vices had any suspicions about
his aide, Katia Zatuliveter, 25,
until she was detained.
Hancock, 64, is a member of
the House of Commons Defense
Committee, and the European
Security and Defense Assembly
of the Western European Union,
a security and defense organiza-
tion. He is a Liberal Democrat,
the junior party in the Conserva-
tive-led government.
In October, The Sunday
Times reported that Home Sec-
retary Theresa May has already
approved Zatuliveter's deten-
tion. The Home Office declined
to comment, saying it never com-
ments on individual cases.
"She is not a Russian spy. I
know nothing about espionage,
but she has been subjected to
a deportation order," Hancock
said. "She is appealing it because
she feels, quite rightly, that she

has done nothing wrong."
The Sunday Times said Zatu-
liveter was stopped and ques-
tioned at Gatwick airport in
August when she returned to
Britain.
Hancock said the security ser-
vices had never told him of their
concerns about Zatuliveter.
"No one has ever said to
me under any circumstances
whatsoever that she has been
involved in anything like that,"
he said. "It is now in the hands
of her lawyers. I am sure that in
the end she will be proved to be
right."
Hancock said Zatuliveter had
been a full-time researcher in his
officer for 2 1/2 years, and earlier
had worked there as an intern.
"As far as I am concerned,
there was nothing she was
doing for me that was sensi-
tive. Defense Select Commit-
tee papers have been leaked to
newspapers before now, and
I have never read anything in
a Defense Select Committee
paper or report which was worth
someone believing they couldn't
get from another source," Han-
cock said in an interview with
the BBC.
He said her work included
hosting constituents visiting
Parliament, writing speech-
es and working on early day

motions, which serve as expres-
sions of lawmakers' opinions.
"Katia was ambitious, she had
ideas to go a lot further than just
working for an MP in the House
of Commons," Hancock said.
Other legislators were cau-
tious in commenting on the case.
Yvette Cooper, the opposition
Labor Party's spokeswoman on
foreign affairs, said she knew
nothing at Zatuliveter's case.
"Depending on what happens
in this individual case, if there
do turn out to be problems and
breaches of security here, then
obviously the wider security in
Parliament would need to be
looked at," Cooper said.
Conservative lawmaker Iain
Duncan Smith said he had never
met the woman.
"Trouble is, I would say nor-
mally this would be a joke but
actually after what's been going
on with some of the spies that
Russia seems to have put into all
sorts of places, you have totake it
quite seriously really I suppose,"
Duncan Smith said in an inter-
view with Sky News.
In July, the government
revoked the British citizen-
ship of Anna Chapman who was
among 10 people who pleaded
guilty in the United States to
procuring information for a for-
eign government.

Saying noto no
Republican senators must do their jobs
Despite their plans, Democrats may not be able to accom-
plish everything on their agenda before Republicans
take control of the U.S. House of Representatives on
Jan. 1. Last week, all 42 Republican senators decided to block
legislative action until Congress extended the Bush-era tax cuts
for everyone - a topic that requires debate, not a line drawn in
the sand. This rash decision creates gridlock in Congress. It's
the job of Congress to create legislation -and Senate Republi-
cans have flat-out refused to do their jobs. Republican senators
need to stop focusing on party interests and work with Demo-
crats to create the best solution for all constituents.

The next Michigan Man

On Dec. 2, the U.S. House voted to
extend the Bush tax cuts for families that
make under $250,000 each year. On Sat-
urday, Senate Republicans rejected the
bill. According to a Dec. 1 New York Times
article, Republican senators plan to block
all legislation until all of the tax cuts were
extended - including those for households
that make more than $250,000 each year.
This plan was outlined in a letter sent to
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-
.Nev.) Wednesday that was signed by all 42
Republicans in the Senate. Later that day,
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell
(R-Ky.) gave a speech scolding Democrats
and President Barack Obama for "ignoring
the midterm election results."
The tax cuts Republicans want aren't a
good idea given the current economic situa-
tion. While the Democrats' proposal would
add an additional $3 trillion to the federal
deficit over the next 10 years, the Republi-
cans' proposal would add $4 trillion. The
Republican tax cuts would onlybetter house-
holds that can afford to pay greater taxes and
would simultaneously hurt the rest of the
country's economic standing. The $1 trillion
added to the deficit would put further - and
unnecessary - pressure on this country's
already unmanageable budget.
But more disturbing than the cuts is the
Republican's attitude. Their approach is

frankly disappointing. Members of Con-
gress are elected and paid with taxpayer
money to pass legislation on behalf of their
constituents. Threatening to block all leg-
islation is irresponsible, particularly at the
end of a session. Other important legislation
- like bills pertaining to the ban on LGBT
people in the military and the Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty - is now at a stand-
still as a result of the Republican's childish
behavior.
The partisan bickering in Washington
D.C. is strongly dividing the nation. In
rough times, Congress needs to work effi-
ciently, compromise and pass comprehen-
sive legislation. Americans want and need
to see policy made. Members of Congress
are elected to help advance the country,
not prevent its development. Republican
senators are putting their party's interests
before the well-being of the nation and its
citizens. This open-ended and unproduc-
tive threat is unacceptable.
The United States is currently plagued by
overwhelming unemployment, thousands
of troops fighting overseas, schools being
closed across the country due to a lack of
funding and poor infrastructure. Instead
of implementing a petty and juvenile stop-
page of all bills, Republican senators need to
refocus their attention on writing and pass-
ing essential legislation.

At the end of the year football
banquet last week, belea-
guered head coach Rich
Rodriguez nearly
wept as he said: "I
truly want to be a
Michigan Man."
But does he even
know what that is?
When Bo
Schembechler died
more than four
years ago, editors
from all sections IMRAN
of the Daily united SYED
to produce a spe-
cial edition of this
newspaper. In that
special edition and on the pages of
the regular editions of the Daily that
week, thousands of words were spo-
ken to celebrate that great Michigan
Man.
My own contribution to that dis-
cussion was a column on this page
(The last Michigan Man, 11/20/2006).
After discussing Schembechler's
unparalleled significance to the
University, I concluded that college
football and campus dynamics had
changed so much over the years that
there never would be another great
football coach who was also a Univer-
sity leader and icon the way that Bo
had been. He was, I wrote at the time,
the last Michigan Man.
Four years later, I see one flaw in
that conclusion. Yes, longgone are the
days when the football coach ruled
campus, when he was a role model
even to students he didn't coach and
when, regardless of who the presi-
dent was, the coach would be the
de facto face of the University. That
much is true, but I forgot something
then that I realize now: Just because
the world has moved on from that
idyllic time does not mean Michigan
football has moved on.

However naive an ideal it may be,
here at the University, we still want
that iconic Michigan Man to lead the
troops on Saturday and to lead us
all every other day. It doesn't matter
where the world may have moved on
to - Michigan football answers to
only its own gravity.
University President Mary Sue Cole-
man and former Athletic Director Bill
Martin also forgot that crucial little
truth when they sought a replacement
for the retiring Lloyd Carr three years
ago. They chose Rodriguez because he
has a brilliant football mind and even
his biggest critics have to admit that
very few people can build an offense
from the ground up like he can. But
excellence with X's and O's is second-
ary here at Michigan.
Yes, Rodriguez has lost far more
games than is moral in Ann Arbor. But
more wins would not cure his seminal
flaw: He has never wanted to be - and
never could be - the consummate,
all-around campus leader that this
University needs its football coach to
be. He's simply not of that breed. He's
not the type to push academics as Joe
Paterno did at Penn State, to push for
social progress like Bear Bryant did at
Alabama or to engage and involve stu-
dents from all walks of campus life as
Schembechler did.
Regardless of what he says, Rodri-
guez came here to coach football,
not to be a Michigan Man. That will
never be good enough, and that's why
Rodriguez will never be left alone to
coach in peace.
The image and destiny of the Uni-
versityhas always beentied tothe state
that gave it its name. For the state of
Michigan, the University has always
been a crown jewel - an indelible part
of the very identity of this state - along
with things like the assembly line,
labor unions and the Great Lakes.
As Michigan has suffered in recent

decades, it has lost the cornerstones
of its once enviable "middle class for
everyone" economy. The assembly ,
lines lie in ruins while thousands of
unemployed auto workers can find
nothing else to do. Labor unions now
take the brunt of the national criti-
cism of the American auto industry's
recent failures. The Great Lakes have
dropped, dried, been polluted and
now stand at the brink of an invasion
by some Asian killer fish. Yeah, it's
gotten pretty bad.
Being Michigan's
head coach goes far
beyond football.
Until three years ago, all was well
with the state's great University and
its football team. But the more you
lose, the more you begin to realize the
significance of what you have. This
University, this state and its people,
regardless of which team they cheer
for, can't afford the loss of yet another
Michigan brand.
We need Michigan football to rise
again to be .the silver bullet for this
state's national reputation that it has
always been. Four years after the last
one died, we need to find the next
Michigan Man to pull us up again
- and I don't just mean getting nine
wins and a trip to Pasadena.
Knowing all that it entails, does
Rodriguez still want tobe a Michigan
Man? Probably not. But there's a man
in Palo Alto who does. And he is per-
haps the only one who could.

The federal budget deficit for 2010 is $1.47
trillion. That's approximately 9.1 percent of the
United States's total economic output for the
year. Since 2001, the Bush tax cuts have cost
the federal government $1.7 trillion. These tax
cuts will expire at the end of the year unless
Congress votes to extend them. According to
the federal office of Management and Bud-
get, if these tax cuts remain in place over the
next decade, they will cost the United States an
additional $3.3 trillion. If that seems unafford-
able, it is. But does this matter to our elected
leaders? Apparently not.
Democrats and Republicans in Congress
are debating whether the Bush tax cuts should
be extended in full or extended only for those
households making less than $250,000 per
year. No one is asking whether it makes sense
to extend them at all.
No one, that is, except the bipartisan deficit
commission appointed to plug that nearly tril-
lion-and-a-half dollar budget hole. The com-
mission came to the sensible conclusion that
spending trillions of dollars to extend tax cuts
already set to expire was, overall, an unproduc-
tive use of government resources. The budget
deficit was one of the biggest issues in the mid-
term elections. Does anyone in Congress actu-
ally care about the deficit? If they do, they sure
have a funny way of showing it.
It would be tempting to blame it all on the
Republicans. When all 42 Republican senators
signed a pledge to block all legislation until
Democrats agree to include tax extensions for
those making more than $250,000 per year, the
Republican Party once again proved its dedica-
tion to improving the lives of America's wealth-
iest citizens.
With their pledge, Republicans declared that
stopping a marginal tax increase on 1 percent
of Americans is more important than anything
else on the federal agenda. The Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty with Russia: less impor-
tant. Plugging the budget deficit: less impor-
tant. Remember that after the last stimulus bill
passed, Republicans declared that the budget
deficit threatened national security. Now they
support a multi-trillion dollar deficit expansion.
But if the Republicans are misguided, the
Democrats aren't much better. They argue that

the Bush tax cuts should be extended for every
household with a yearly income of $249,999.99
or less. Over the next 10 years, this plan would
save the government $700 billion relative to
what it would have lost by extending tax cuts
for the richest 1 percent of Americans. If the
Democrats have their way and extend tax cuts
for 99 percent of Americans, the government
would lose out on $2.6 trillion between now
and 2020.
The recession complicates the tax cut equa-
tion. Economic theory holds that an effective
recovery is possible only when lots of money is
available in the economy. Tax cuts, increased
government spending and inflation are three
ways to increase money supply. Together, these
three activities stimulate demand in the econ-
omy and begin a self-reinforcing cycle of eco-
nomic growth and job creation. Tax increases
remove some money from the general-economy.
Therefore, during a recession, a tax increase
could put a crimp on economic growth and
slowdown the recovery.
Many argue that the Bush tax cuts should
be extended to avoid this kind of crippling tax
increase. Peter Orszag, former director of the
Office of Management and Budget under Presi-
dent Obama, has suggested that the tax cuts
should remain in place temporarily for some
income levels. His plan would limit the tax
increase to those people least likely to spend
their money -that richest1percent - and would
also be an important step toward reining in the
budget deficit. Unfortunately, Republicans have
outright rejected this sensible proposal.
Tax cuts are a form of stimulus. Both par-
ties are in favor of the Bush tax cut stimulus
program, but their divide over the $250,000
bracket can tell us a lot about each party's priori-
ties. Republicans want to keep giving stimulus
money to the wealthiest Americans, while Dem-
ocrats support stimulus cash for everyone up to
and including the slightly-less-than extremely
wealthy Americans. Neither party is willing to
address the budget deficit. The Bush tax cuts
are a huge drain on the federal budget. Allowing
them to continue in any form for more than two
years would be truly irresponsible.

Teacher examination

'm certain that you have had
some terrible teachers. Teachers
can be awful for a lot of reasons:
they're confus-
ing, they write bad-
tests and quizzes,
they give miser-
able lectures, they
pontificate for 20
minutes about .
something com- t
pletely unrelated i
to the class's sub-
ject or they're just RACHEL
plain mean. I haveV
experienced all VAN GILDER
of these things at
least once during
my time here at the University and
some when I was in high school.
The state legislature is working on
a way to find those bad teachers more
quickly and get them out of the class-
room. But it's anyone's guess if the
method they've proposed will work.
On Dec. 1, the Michigan Senate
passed a bill to alter the way teach-
ers are evaluated. If passed, 45 per-
cent of a teacher's evaluation would
be based upon student achievement in
the form of performance on statewide
standardized tests and school-spe-
cific assessments, according to a Dec.
2 report by The Detroit News. The
legislation now goes before the state
House of Representatives and might
make it to a vote before the lame duck
session ends on Friday. But that seems
unlikely considering the objections
of powerful teachers' unions like the
Michigan Education Association.
Maybe Michigan tenure needs
reform - it takes a fair amount of
time and effort to remove tenured
teachers unless they do something
blatantly egregious. On one hand,
that prevents adequate teachers from
being forced out of a district simply
because they ticked off a parent, stu-
dent or administrator. On the other
hand, it also protects teachers who
have never done well even though
they have been granted tenure.

Here in Michigan, we have fairly
good teachers overall because we have
a lot of strong teaching programs.
Michigan State University, Grand Val-
ley State University and, of course,
the University of Michigan have great
teacher education programs. And
Michigan certification is among the
most difficult to obtain in the nation.
Michigan certification will transfer
to a lot of other states fairly easily. It's
muchmore difficult to transfer out-of-
state certification to Michigan.
But that's not to say that every
single Michigan teacher is awesome.
Despite the quality of Michigan
teaching programs, there are always
going to be some poor teachers. And
they shouldn't retain their positions
if they're doing a bad job.
. The problem is figuring out what
"doing a bad job" means - and what
it means to do a good job. That's
because everyone likes teachers for
different reasons. For kids, a lot of it
has to do with personality. For par-
ents, a lot of it has to do with helping
their kid get into college. For the gov-
ernment (and school administrations
focused on funding), it's all about the
standardized test results. Teachers,
meanwhile, often just want to help
students learn. And though all of
those things are connected, they are
never the same thing.
In the School of Education here
at the University, we talk a lot about
grades, testing and learning. Some-
times, learning can't be effectively
measured in an empirical way. Some-
times, the best teacher is the one that
helps a troubled kid find peace in the
classroom. These students may not
learn anything about geometry or
Shakespeare - but maybe that's okay
if they feel like, for the first time,
they're in a safe, caring environment.
But students obviously need
to know about obtuse angles and
"Romeo and Juliet." Teachers have
a responsibility to present informa-
tion in interesting and varied ways to
appeal to the broadest possible range

of learners. They have a responsibil-
ity to help students understand that
learning is a life-long process, not
just something that happens for the
seven hours a day that the students
are in school. And sometimes, even if
students apply themselves, they still
won't get an 'A+'. If teachers teach
material specifically related to stan-
dardized tests in an effort to increase
students' scores, they're often teach-
ing test-taking skills instead of con-
tent knowledge. Test-taking skills
can be important, but shouldn't be
overvalued.
Learning often *
can't be measured
by a grade.
Sometimes, it's obvious that a
teacher is inadequate. Students don't
respond to these teachers, grades
remain low and there's no evidence
that students are progressing. But
because everyone has a different
perspective on what a good teacher
is, these teachers are few and far
between. Less effective teachers are
hard to point out.
The consensus among a lot of edu-
cators is that learning often can't be
measured by a grade. It can only be
measured by a student's attitude.
At the end of the day, it's a student's *
responsibility to apply themself. It's
the teacher's job to show them how.
I don't know everything that
makes a good teacher. I don't know
if it's possible to know. But what I do
know is that students' performance
on tests shouldn't be the determining
factor.

America works to secure
networks as hackers advance

Several area eateries say they would

Timeline says it will
take several years
to create systems to
block hackers
WASHINGTON (AP) - It will
take several more years for the
government to fully install high-
tech systems to block computer
intrusions, a drawn-out timeline
that enables criminals tobecome
more adept at stealing sensitive
data, experts say.
As the Department of Home-
land Security moves methodi-
cally to pare down and secure
the approximately 2,400 net-
work connections used every day
. by millions of federal workers,
experts suggest that technology
already may be passing them by.
The department that's respon-
sible for securing government
systems other than military sites
is slowly moving all the govern-

"Obviously, Michigan is one
of those elite universities that
has a national brand recogni-
tion," Catlett said. "They have a
tremendous number of alumni
in the United States - a tremen-
dous amount of alumni who live
in the state of Florida. And we
think the program with the star-
power with the quarterback, and
(it's) a program that's turning the
corner and starting to head in
the right direction. They'll bring
a lot of fans and a lot of TV eyes
and an exciting football game."
Last week in a separate inter-
view with the Daily, Catlett said
that the economic impact on
the Jacksonville community, a
potentially full stadium and high
television ratings would drive
the selection process.
Sophomore quarterback
Denard Robinson is the type
of player fans pay to watch and
Catlett acknowledged how spe-
cial a talent the Big Ten Offen-
sive Player of the Year is.
"If it wasn't for (Auburn quar-
terback) Cam Newton, he'd be
right in the middle of the Heis-
man Trophy hunt," Catlett said.
"And that's always exciting. He's
probably one of those four or five
athletes that stand out above the
rest as it relates to his talents and
his abilities."

ing because the $10 million ran
out after the first five years of the
agreement.
In 2009, the DDA and the
city reached an agreement that
entailed a $2-million grant from
the DDA to the city to avoid debt.
In exchange, the city promised to
renegotiate its parking contract
with the DDA. The two entities

have been working together over
the past year to renegotiate the
contract.
"The city's track record with
downtown development and
parking is not as good as it should
be," said City Council member
Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1).
Under the current agreement,
the DDA officials must notify
the city if they plan to make any
parking changes. Unless the city
raises any objections to the pro-
posed changes within 60 days,
the amendment goes into effect.
According to DDA Executive
Director Susan Pollay, City Coun-
cil has never objected to a pro-
posal made by the DDA in her 15
years with the organization.
The city receives a set rate of
parking income from the DDA
under the current contract. If
approved, the new agreement
would give the city a set per-
centage of the parking income
- increasing profits from the
downtown parking structures.
"The proposal is an advantage
for the city," Briere said. "The
more people that visit and park
downtown, the more money the
city will make."
According to Briere, the DDA
says that the new proposal will
allow the city to avoid making
tough political decisions about
contentious issues like parking

ment's Internet and e-mail traf-
fic into secure networks that
eventually will be guarded by
intrusion detection and preven-
tion programs.
Progress has been slow, how-
ever. Officials are trying to com-
plete complex contracts with
network vendors, work out tech-
nology issues and address pri-
vacy concerns involving how the
monitoring will affect employ-
ees and public citizens.
The WikiLeaks release of,
more than a quarter-million
sensitive diplomatic documents
underscores the massive chal-
lenge ahead, as Homeland Secu-
rity labors to build protections
for all of the other, potentially
more vulnerable U.S. agencies.
"This is a continuing arms
race and we're still way behind,"
said Stewart Baker, former
Homeland Security undersecre-
tary for policy.
The WikiLeaks breach affect-
ed the government's classi-
the Big Ten's best offense, which
is tasked with scoring on a Bull-
dogs team that allows 20 points
per game - the No. 27 scoring
defense in Division-I football.
Mississippi State finished fifth
in the SEC west, but don't let that
fool you. The four teams ahead of
the Bulldogs were No. 1 Auburn,
No. 8 Arkansas, No. 11 LSU and
No. 15 Alabama - which all
accounted for Mississippi State's
only four losses on the season.
And the most impressive of
those losses may have come
against Auburn on Sept. 9 when
the Tigers needed to stop the
Bulldogs' final drive to hold
on 17-14. Mississippi State held
Newton to 136 yards passing and
70 yards rushing on the game.
"You always want to know
- people say you win champi-
onships with defenses," Catlett
said. "It's the classic matchup of
defense versus a good offense.
And we're going to enjoy trying
to figure out which of them is
going to break first."
Whether there are offensive
fireworks or not, there will be
media and fan speculation lead-
ing up to the Gator Bowl regard-
ing Rodriguez's job status. The
embattled coach showed emotion
during the football team's ban-
quet on Dec. 2 and the murmurs
that his job may be in jeopardy
started to pick up after the Wol-
verines lost their final two games
by a combined score of 85-35.
Catlett and the Gator Bowl
have a longstanding relationship
with the coach, though. He led
West Virginia to a 1-2 record in
the bowl game with appearanc-
es in 2003, 2004 and 2006. And
Catlett called him "one of the
prices.
However, Briere said she is "not
particularly happy with the idea
that the City Council will not take
responsibility for the citizens" on
parking issues if the proposal is
passed.
Despite Briere's concerns, Pol-
lay said the public would still be
able to hold the DDA accountable
for its decisions.
"The DDA is not a for-profit
organization looking to gener-
ate profits from parking," Pollay
said. "Rather, it is a public agency

responsible to and responsive to
its community."
While parking costs could
potentially increase due to the
current economic state, Briere
said the DDA is working to make
sure the cost of parking in Ann
Arbor is as low as possible.

fied military network and was
as much a personnel gap as a
technological failure. Officials
believe the sensitive documents
were stolen from secure Penta-
gon computer networks by an
Army intelligence analyst.
The canges sought by Home-
land Security on the govern-
ment's nonmilitary computers
would be wider and more sys-
temic than the immediate
improvements ordered recently
by the Departments of Defense
and State as a result of the
WikiLeaks releases. Those
changes included improving the
monitoring of computer usage
and making it harder to move
material onto a portable com-
puter flash drive or CD.
"There are very few private
sector actors who depend on
information security who think
that installing intrusion preven-
tion systems is sufficient protec-
tion against the kinds of attacks
that we're seeing," Baker said.
best coaches in America," in the
interview yesterday.
The buzzing around the pro-
gram didn't deter the committee
from making its selection.
"I think coaches understand
that every time they play a foot-
ball game that there's pressure,"
Catlett said. "Coach Rodriguez
understands that better than
anybody. And I think if any-
thing, it brings an element of
- we know Michigan's going to
show up to play. We never had a
West Virginia team that didn't
look prepared and didn't show
up to play and play hard. And
we believe coach Rodriguez
will have his team prepared and
ready to play. And that's alithat
really concerns us."
Rodriguez engineered an
offense that accumulated more
than 500 yards per game this
season. But
Michigan's defense was found
at the other end of that statistical
spectrum and allowed nearly 34
points per game. With the prog-
ress in the wins and losses col-
umns (3-9 in 2008, 5-7 in 2009
and 7-5 in 2010), some agree with
Catlett that Michigan is heading
in the right direction.
"Again, we might not see
Michigan in the next few years
because they might be playing in
the Rose Bowl," Catlett said.

"The DDA wants people to park
downtown and spend money in
stores instead of on parking tick-
ets or fees," Briere said. "Keep-
ing parking costs down will be
stimulation for the Ann Arbor
economy."
Though the proposal will not
have a direct effect on the Uni-
versity, Pollay said the agency
will continue to keep students'
and visitors' needs in mind when
implementing the plan.
"As managers of the public
parking system, the DDA has

always viewed U-M students, vis-
itors, faculty and staff as hugely
important stakeholders and it has
striven to manage its parking in
support of these and other con-
stituents," Pollay said. "Going for-
ward, the DDA's goals will remain
the same."

"Ohio State, as much as I don't
like to admit it, is very similar to
us," Benson said. "If Ohio State
can do it, then I think we can also
model after them and do it here,
too."
After returning from the trip,
Benson said LSA-SG decided to
poll students to determine if they
would be interested in expanding
the Blue Bucks program.
Benson said that because a
majority of students voted in favor
of Blue Bucks, he and other stu-
dent government representatives
are confident in moving forward
with this campaign.
Benson added that he is cur-
rently trying to organize meetings
with University Housing repre-
sentatives.
University Housing spokesman
Peter Logan said the University
would be interested in discussing
a Blue Bucks expansion with Ben-
son, but would have to evaluate the
details of the new program before
implementing it.
"We really haven't fully evalu-
ated the pros and cons and the
logistics involved," Logan said. "If
we're going to develop a program,
we need to know how we would
logistically carry it out."
EatBlue.com, an online din-

ing guide that includes several
Ann Arbor restaurants, currently
offers a program similar to Blue
Bucks for use at some Ann Arbor
restaurants and shops.
The "EatBlue Meal Plan" allows
students to use a pre-paid meal
card to pay for meals at a variety of
restaurants in the Ann Arbor area.
EatBlue.com owner David Laid-
erman said he's concerned that if
Blue Bucks expands its offerings,
the program would compete too
directly with the EatBlue Meal
Plan.
"We're in only our first year,"
Laiderman said. "It would be a
blow to our service."
Several local restaurants
said they would be interested in
accepting Blue Bucks as payment.
Five out of five restaurant own-
ers and managers interviewed by
the Daily - including Mr. Greek's
Coney Island, Amer's and Big-
gby Coffee - expressed interest
in implementing Blue Bucks as a
form of payment accepted in their
establishments.
Matt Arthur, the owner of the
Ben and Jerry's franchise located
at 304 S. State St., said that he has
already contacted the University
to ask how he can accept Blue
Bucks. Arthur said he's lost busi-
ness several times from students
who thought they could use Blue

Bucks at his restaurant.
Arthur added that though he
believes having a Blue Bucks
option would improve his busi-
ness, he's slightly concerned about
processing costs.
Logan said that current partici-
pating businesses are required to
return 3.5 percent of the total of
each sale in which Blue Bucks are
used.
Jon Garcia, general manager
of Cosi at 301 S. State St., said he
believes the benefits of implement-
ing the program would compen-
sate for the costs that businesses
might incur.
"There's always going to be
costs and processing fees, but
when you're in business, you have
to look at the big picture," Gar-
cia said. "The profit is going to be
there, it's going to outweigh any
negatives, as far as cost goes."
Garcia added that Cosi's loca-
tion in East Lansing accepts
Spartan Cash, Michigan State
University's form of Blue Bucks
and that the program has been
successful there.
While all five of the business-
es appeared to be interested in
the program, Benson said LSA-
SG members are not currently
approaching local businesses, but
they may work with them in the
future.

them immediately for their mis-
takes, Boothman said.
Boothman added that doctors
have "embraced" the initiative
because the point of their job is to
help others.
"I think we tapped something
that is natural for them," he said.
Peter Davis, a professional lia-
bility lawyer in Ann Arbor who is
familiar with Boothman's program,
said the system allows "doctors-
to feel some level of comfort they
haven't felt before" when disclosing
their mistakes.
Another benefit of the program
according to Boothman is that it
encourages doctors to be honest
with patients, something both par-
ties value.
"I think as a culture as we get
courser and the political discourse
gets more and more polarized, the
idea that people can actually be sin-
cere and honest becomes more and
more a foreign concept," he said. "I
think that's a big reason why there's
such a preoccupation with our pro-
gram."
In 2003, Dr. Allen Kachalia, the
chief medical resident at the time,
received a grant from Blue Cross
Blue Shield to study the program's
effects, specifically if the number of

Zazula said the gunshots were
fired after the fight broke out.
According to the AAPD, the
suspect is a black male about 200
pounds and short in height. At the
time of the incident, he was seen
wearing a black shirt with red and

blue colors and black sweatpants.

liability claims filed changes when
a hospital decides to disclose medi-
cal errors.
Kachalia explained that the
results of the study showed that a
better informed patient, and one
who is treated as an individual,
is a lot less likely to respond in an
adversarial way to mistakes, which
will in turn reduce claims.
Kachalia said the University
Hospital was one of the first public
medical centers to use a program
that encourages doctors to disclose
their mistakes.
Davis, the liability lawyer, said
the program set a precedent for
handling medical malpractice cases
and laid the groundwork for other
hospitals to push similar initiatives.
"It is a program that serves the
public," he added.
Though other institutions can
learn from the program at UMHS,
Kachalia emphasized that UMHS's
program is just one institution's
experience and doesn't conclu-
sively prove that medical disclosure
lowers liability. Instead, it shows
that one center has been successful
in loweringclaims costs.
Between 2001 and 2007, the
number of average legal expenses
for UMHS declined 61 percent,
according to the medical journal
"Annals of Internal Medicine."
Boothman and Kachalia say

patients have responded favorably
to the program.
"Most patients would appreciate
any medical system that is going to
be transparent, admits its mistakes
and offers compensation for its
mistakes," Kachalia said.
There is also now a greater
emphasis on the quality of the rela-
tionship between the doctor and
patient, he continued.
Dr. Lakshmi Halasyamani, vice
president of quality and systems
improvement at St. Joseph Mercy
Hospital, said admitting medical
errors is not only important for
decreasingclaims costs, but it's also
"the right thing to do."
According to Halasyamani, St.
Joseph Mercy Hospital implement-
ed a program five years ago that is
similar to the program in place at
UMHS. St. Joseph Mercy Hospi-
tal's program encourages doctors
to admit mistakes and guarantees
that they are supported throughout
the process.
"(UMHS) is not the only one
who has made these changes,"
Halasymani said. "They've just had
an opportunity to evaluate their
changes."
Boothman said the hospital is
always working to improve medical
practices and added that employees
don't plan to return to their former
practice of suppressing mistakes.

Israeli public criticizes leaders'management of wildfire

Country's media
pointing fingers
at Netanyahu,
interior minister
JERUSALEM (AP) -Israelioffi-
cials came under sharp criticism
yesterday for their handling of the
country's deadliest wildfire ever,
prompting critics to ask whether
the nation's leaders can cope with
more serious challenges, like rocket
attacks and a nuclear-armed Iran.
Israelis have been riveted to
round-the-clock coverage of the
blaze, which has claimed 41 lives
and devastated one of the few
forests in this arid country. The
site of bumbling leaders and over-
whelmed rescuers turning to the
outside world for help sparked
anger over the vulnerability of a
nervous - and densely populated
- home front.
Late yesterday, a senior fire
official, Boaz Rakia, declared the
blaze under control, though it was

unclear when it would be extin-
guished.
Israel has long prided itself on
its ability to minimize civilian
casualties in times of conflict. But
just four years after a devastating
war against Lebanese Hezbol-
lah guerrillas, in which the civil
defense system was caught off
guard by waves of rocket fire, the
nation still appears ill-prepared to
handle its next disaster.
"We are entitled to expect of our
governments not to be smart only
after the fact but - at least once -
to be smart before disaster strikes,"
Nahum Barnea, the nation's pre-
eminent newspaper columnist,
wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
"That hasn't happened because we
have no national leadership here
that is capable of rising above the
immediate problems."
Israeli media are pointing fin-
gers atanumberofofficials, includ-
ing Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Interior Minister
Eli Yishai, a politician from the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party whose
office oversees fire services. Yishai

made a handy target because his
party is widely despised by Israel's
secular Jewish majority.
But there was little expectation
heads will roll, a prospect likely to
add to the lack of confidence in the
leadership.
With national leaders routinely
describing Iran - which Israel
and the U.S. believe is trying to
develop nuclear weapons - as the
country's greatest threat, Maariv
columnist Ben Caspit asked how
Israel could conceive of attacking
Iran's nuclear facilities, "an act lia-
ble to lead to a war of missiles on an
enormous scale never seen before
in the world, without even giving
a shred of consideration to Israel's
ability to put out fires?"
The blaze, believed to be the
result of negligence by two teenag-
ers smoking a water pipe, broke out
on Thursday, and quickly spread
because of unseasonably hot and
dry conditions. A 20-square-mile
(50-square-kilometer) area, about
half of the Carmel forest, a popular
nature spot on the outskirts of Isra-
el's third-largest city, Haifa, has

been torched, and 17,000 people
were evacuated from their homes.
The blaze engulfed a bus full of
prison guards helping in rescue
efforts, killing 37 people in a mat-
ter of moments. Two senior police
officers and two firefighters were

also killed.
Over the weekend, Israeli TV
and radio stations carried reports
from the site of what they dubbed
"the Carmel disaster."
Yesterdays's newspapers print-
ed profiles of the victims, among

them a 16-year-old honors student
who volunteered with the fire ser-
vice.~Reflecting the deep sense of
national loss, radio stations broad-
cast somber music throughout the
day - a custom usually confined to
wartime.

Avant-garde TV

Brewing boredom

Within the walls of the
United States Capitol
Building, Congress
has been hard at work passing
legislation in the best interest of
the American
public. Though
many may
have a cynical
view of our
lawmakers and
their partisana
interests, last
week Congress
was passed CAROLYN
an important KLARECKI
* mandate -
not a repeal
of "don't ask, don't tell," not
progress on the DREAM Act,
but instead the very impor-
tant CALM act, or Commercial
Advertisement Loudness Mitiga-
tion Act.
This new mandate will require
the FCC to regulate volume levels
on television commercials, which
can sometimes be absolutely
blaring compared to the volume
of the actual program. Such
complaints have been growing
steadily for some time, but they
are nothing new. Objections over
commercial volume have been
around since television's incep-
tion in the 1950s.
When people caught on to
television's commercial inten-
tions, a vehement distrust of
commercials arose. In 1963, the
Wall Street Journal reported on
the issue, saying that the FCC
had uncovered a problem of truly
major significance.
This came only shortly after
the revelation that some incred-
ibly popular 1950s quiz shows
were rigged - people were
disposed to distrust television.
This skepticism was manifested
in a number of ways before the
commercial problem even came
along, including a protest of
laugh tracks, which were seen as
another way television promoted
a false image. At the time, this
was a serious issue. CBS actually
took action by briefly prohibiting
the use of laugh tracks in comedy
shows.
In my opinion, the criticism
- and cynicism toward the medium
in that era was turned around
largely due to one man who took
an experimental approach to tele-
vision and came out with some-
thing pretty special. This man is
Ernie Kovacs.
Kovacs is best known for his
. "Silent Show," a half-hour com-
edy in which he played Eugene,
a Chaplin-esque character who
wandered through a surreal story
guided only by music and sound
effects - no dialogue. Even the
commercials were without dia-
logue. "There's a great deal of
conversation that takes place
on television. From way in the
morning 6 a.m. ... to all hours of
the night. I thought perhaps ...
you might like to spend a half
hour without hearing any dia-
logue at all," read the opening
credits of the "Silent Show."
The show was wildly praised.
It was clever, it was funny and
it was artistic. Kovacs employed
humorous sketches, which would
later inspire shows like "Monty
Python's Flying Circus" and "Sat-
urday Night Live." Chevy Chase
famously thanked Kovacs for his

influence in his Emmy accep-
tance speech in 1976. The success
of "Silent TV" prompted silent
episodes of "77 Sunset Strip,"
"Gilligan's Island" and "The
Patty Duke Show." Most impor-
tant, the show was highbrow and
intelligent.
Similar to "Mad Men," viewers
felt smart when watching "Silent
Show." It was a creative experi-
ment unlike anything else on TV
at the time. Kovacs enjoyed clas-
sical music and used it in many
of his programs. Newspapers
compared him to Salvador Dali
and James Joyce, and he was in
television. He received heaps of
fan mail, preserved in the Ernie
Kovacs Papers, praising his show,
offering him ideas for sketches
and sending him drawings and
photographs influenced by his
surreal TV show. He made true
avant-garde TV.
However, though his comedic
influence is still seen today (Craig
Ferguson and David Letterman
both cite Kovacs as an inspira-
tion, though Kovacs is better,
trust me), it's quite obvious that
silent TV never caught on in the
long run. In fact, we see that
I'm with the
Commercials
Are Too Damn
Loud party.
shows have gotten even louder.
But the recent passage of the
CALM Act got me thinking about
Ernie Kovacs and his silent enter-
tainment. TV isn't so different
today from how it was in the late
1950s. We're immersed ina period
of television disillusionment
where instead of quiz show lies,
we're fed the lies of reality TV
and sensationalism. Our televi-
sion casts the craziest people and
manipulates them into fighting,
calling it "real" - "The Bachelor"
has been known to fill the house
kitchen with lots of booze and not
much else to make tensions flare.
Some of the contestants on "Cash
Cab" aren'tcjust picked off the
streets, but are screened or even
recruited prior to their appear-
ance - and the cash Ben Bailey
hands them at the end of the show
isn't even real. And promos have
been known to take a show's best
and juiciest material out of con-
text with thrilling voiceovers tell-
ing you, "You won't believe what
happens next," only to manipulate
you into watching sub-par and
predictable television.
So while the CALM Act solves
one of the problems that Kovacs
managed to fix through "Silent
Show," much of our distrust has
yet to be addressed. We don't
necessarily need another "Silent
Show," but we could certainly use
creativity, innovation and experi-
mentation in the vein of Kovacs's
avant-garde programming. At the
very least, let's keep our fingers
crossed for a bill banning the
laugh track.
Klarecki has taken a vow of
silence. To "speak" with her, you

'Brew Masters'
lacks fizz of other
Discovery shows
By JACOB AXELRAD
Daily Arts Writer
As one might venture to guess,
Discovery's latest reality series
"Brew Mas-
ters" is about
one thing: beer *T
- lots and lots
of beer. Brew
The series
centers on Sam
Calagione, Mondays at
founder and 10 p.m.
president of Discovery
Dogfish Head,
a craft brew-
ery that specializes in custom
beer. From 2,700-year-old Turk-
ish recipes to a St. Patrick's Day
formula that incorporates pond
scum to turn beer green, this
Delaware-based brewery will
go to any length to achieve the
desired product. Its mission, as
emphasized by the Ralph Waldo
Emerson quote that hangs promi-
nently within its factory,isnto cre-
ate something that's never existed
before. And yet with a subject
matter as narrow as beer and only
beer, there's little room in the
show for a compelling story, mak-
ing this brewery a decidedly dull
one to watch.
The premiere begins in a some-
what promising manner. Sony
Records calls with a job for Dog-
fish Head: create a beer commem-
orating the 40th anniversary of
the legendary Miles Davis album
"Bitches Brew." From here, Cala-
gione and the Dogfish Head
employees work to create the.
perfect beer to coincide with
the re-release of the jazz album.
This takes them through the
subsequent steps of purchasing
ingredients, the science behind
brewing, the factory work (and
yes, this means all the not-so-
fun nuts and bolts of an assembly
line) and a meeting with Davis's

nephew, who has the final say on
any drink that puts his uncle on
the label. The end product fuses
honey and gesho root, a combi-
nation of African and American
ingredients to mirror the music
that Davis played so famously.
However, "Brew Masters" fails
to show any of the onscreen cama-
raderie and banter that made
the other Discovery series like
"Mythbusters" and "Dirty Jobs"
so successful. Calagione, who also
serves as narrator, seems awk-
ward and stiff outside his comfort
zone as head of the brewery. His
jokes, like "Beer is quintessen-
tially American, I mean, that's
why they landed on Plymouth
Rock," fall flat and appear out
of place in the larger context of
the show. Additional attempts to
prove their entertainment worth
are just absurd - Calagione and
his partner Bryan Selders unfor-
tunately feel compelled to dem-
onstrate mediocre rap skills with
clips from their hip-hop group,
the "Pain Relievers."
The show finds footing only

when depicting the process of
brewing quality craft beer. The
few scenes describing how to
design this new drink in a mat-
ter of weeks are intriguing and
educational. Additionally, craft
breweries are independent of
"Big Beer," which Calagione says
pulls in 95 percent of beer-drink-
ers nationwide. The economics
behind this dynamic give Dog-
fish Head the romantic air of the
little guys struggling against the
corporate machine. In this sense,
"Brew Masters" becomes a meta-
phor - it uses a privately owned
brewery to parallel the modern
American Dream.
Unfortunately, this idea is
only glossed over. The series as
it stands needs major reconfig-
uring. At the moment, we have a
jumbled assortment of historical
beer tidbits, unnecessary narra-
tion, hip-hop performances and a
factory full of workers who seem
a bit puzzled as to why cameras
are all of a sudden followingthem
around. We, the audience, are
equally puzzled.

'Jam' getting stale

"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, You killed my father. Prepare to die!"
'Warrior' loses

Ninjas descend upon Old
West town, but it's not as
exciting as you think
By PHILIP CONKLIN
Daily Arts Writer
The first scene of "The Warrior's
Way," from first-time writer and direc-
tor Sngmoo Lee, sets up an action-packed
modern martial-arts
film. The dark cinema-
tography and stylized,
comic book-like ani- The
mation create a capti- Wanior's
vating atmosphere as
black-robed swordsmen Way
explode out of the mist At Quality16
to attack the hero, Yang
(Jang Dong Gun, "The a
Promise"), who coolly Rogue
cuts them down with
the deft precision of a practiced warrior.
It's exciting, original and sets a high stan-
dard. But as the film progresses, it feels
like this opening belongs to another film.
After his anonymous foes have been
felled, Yang, who the audience learns is
the best swordsman in the world, is con-
fronted with a decision: Should he follow
through with his orders and kill the last
surviving member of a rival clan, who
happens tobe a baby?
Of course, our merciful hero refuses to
commit such a base act, even after hav-
ing murdered the baby's entire family.

Instead, he absconds with the infant to
a small town in the American West, his
own clan in hot, vengeful pursuit. Unfor-
tunately, it takes them almost the entire
movie to find him, leaving the film's mid-
dle third nearly devoid of action.
The premise of the movie is thin and
the plot even thinner, supported by life-
less, cliched writing and caricatured
roles. Kate Bosworth ("21") plays Lynne,
the local circus's knife thrower with a
troubled, bloody past - an outlaw named
"The Colonel" (Danny Huston, "Robin
Hood"), whose appearance provides the
only action in the movie's middle third,
killed her family when she was a girl. The
relationship between Lynne and Yang is
formulaic and entirely unconvincing, and
their love story, which dominates half of
the movie, lacks vitality.
"The Warrior's Way" shines in the fight
sequences. They are beautifully shot and
intricately choreographed, often with
ballet-like grace. These scenes move at
a quick and energetic pace, and have
a highly nuanced visual style, includ-
ing tasteful use of slow motion and cre-
ative effects, like an extreme close-up of
a sword slicing through rain drops and
strobe light-like stop motion. It's clear
Lee is a talented director with a specific
vision and an eye for action.
Unfortunately, the movie fails on almost
every other level. The acting, despite an
impressive performance by what has to be
the best baby actor in the world, is gener-
ally laughable, with Bosworth's perfor-
mance being particularly lackluster. Dong

its way
Gun's performance also lacks vigor, which
is partly due to his character's stoicism; he
rarely speaks, even during the emotional
love scenes. Geoffrey Rush (the "Pirates
of the Caribbean" series), who plays the
town drunk, gives the movie's best perfor-
mance, but his character is such a cliche
that no level of acting can save it.
"Warrior's Way" also ostensibly
explores the similarities between Eastern
samurai beliefs and the values of the old
American West. However, the filmmaker
handles these themes clumsily, just add-
ing clutter to an already unfocused movie.
The references to the two philosophies
are too overt to be effective and don't fit
with the movie's tone.
The movie, like many fantasy films,
takes place in a sort of alternate universe,
where hordes of flying ninjas descend
upon Old West towns and cowboys
wield automatic machine guns. However
absurd this seems at first blush, it works
when the movie gives itself over entirely
to its own absurdity. Even the non-fight
scenes that are shot in this style are
entrancing and fun to watch. But when-
ever the film moves away from its fantasy
sensibility, either to comedy or romance,
it loses energy.
The final battle scene is epic and
intense, but not worth the hour-long build
up. Watching Yang annihilate the droves
of faceless warriors, one can't help but
feel disappointed knowing that the whole
movie could have been like this, rather
than another tired entry in the annals of
Hollywood action-romances.

"NBA Jam" brings back so many mem-
ories. In 1993, when video gaming was
much more casual and console hardware
was more limiting, "NBA
Jam" fit right in. Fast-
forward 17 years and
EA Canada is picking NBA Jam
up where Midway went
bankrupt in 2009 and PS3,Wii and
attemptingto extend the Xbox 360
franchise - a similar EA Sports
but not especially suc-
cessful attempt was also made in 2003. It
seems, though, that EA missed the ferry to
contemporary gaming and produced this
new "Jam" title from Midway's island in
the past.
The main selling point of the game is
the retention of its roots. And while this
evokes nostalgia, how much can a game be
true to its originsbefore it becomes redun-
dant? All the humorous announcements
from the original are included ("Boom-
shakalaka," etc.), but is this really what EA
should focus on? This commentary is sure
to inspire a good laugh for the first few
games, but after a while it seems like the
staff at EA was just too lazy to find new
ideas. Humor, especially meta-humor, can
be a great attribute of video games, but the
jokes in "Jam" quickly dissolve into self-
parody.
Nostalgia will only
get you so far.
The graphics are also very unimpres-
sive, furthering the self-deprecation of
this title. Each basketball player has a
digitally rendered 2-D cutout of the real'
player's face, making each of them look
like celebrities in "South Park," and yes, it
gets old really fast. EA may again squeeze
a few laughs out of gamers, but soon the
realization that you have to look at these
stupid faces every single game takes over
and players feel duped. The more you have
to look at these faces, the more they begin
to resemble the programmers at EA who
forced foolish gamers into staring at them.
Big-head mode compounds those prob-
lems, and the other extra additions to
"Jam" don't do much to help the matter.
"Break the backboard" mode is basically a
normal game, except it requires a dunk to
win, and the others are equally insignifi-

cant. Thank goodness for the inclusion of
online play, though, which is a necessity
for the lonely gamers out there.
The controls are easy to learn, and they
only take a little while to master. Flick up
on the control stick, and at the peak of the
jump, flick down on the control stick. If it's
timed right, it will swish. "Steal" is a flick
to either the left or the right of the control
stick, and a shove is performed with the
same controls as a steal, but with turbo
selected. The simplicity is nice, but after
about an hour, the controls are mastered
and there isn't much room for improve-
ment.
The throwback to simplicity isn't a
problem in itself, but that doesn't mean EA
should remake a Genesis game on the PS3
without opening it up a little bit. Resort-
ing to some new controls and a couple
new features does not meet the standards
of a next-generation release. "NBA Jam"
hardly brings anything new to the table
and, though there are a few tasty morsels,
the meat EA invites you to dine on is just
17-year-old gristle.
This isn't "FIFA" and it does notdeserve
the status of a fleshed-out sports game.
"Sonic" and "Street Fighter" revamps have
been released on the Playstation Network
at affordable prices, but EA goes and puts
its "Jam" remake on Blu-ray at full price.
This could have been a good download-
able title; a casual game here and there is
a lot of fun, especially with a partner. But
if you have a Genesis or a Nintendo 64, the
old "Jams" will satisfy the desire for a little
casual competition. And if you decide to
buy this game, make sure you look up the
codes to unlock the Democrats and Repub-
licans. It'll make the experience that much
more enjoyable.

Blue punches ticket to Second-half dominance on
I first-ever College Cup display in Wolverines' win

Lucky break saves Michigan split

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Douglass's surge
tops the Crimson

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Writer
COLUMBUS - Two bounces
and 10.4 seconds were the differ-
ence between a series split and
a sweep for the No. 11 Michigan
hockey
team's MICHIGAN 2
series OHIO STATE 3
with Ohio -- ----
State. MICHIGAN 2
After OHIO STATE 1
leading
by a goal in the final minute of play
on Friday night, the Wolverines
allowed a game-tying tally and
fell, 3-2, in overtime. On Saturday,
it looked like the Wolverines were
headed for a rerun performance at
Value City Arena.
But a heavy dose of puck luck
produced an alternative ending -
a 2-1 Michigan victory.
The Wolverine offense had a
furious pace for the entirety of
Saturday's game, peppering Buck-
eye goaltender Cal Heeter with a

season-high 48 shots. But it wasn't
until the third period when Michi-
gan (8-3-1-0 CCHA, 9-5-4 overall),
trailing 1-0, finally scored.
And the equalizing goal came in
the most unlikely of ways.
Just over six minutes into the
third period, junior forward Luke
Glendening carried the puck along
the right-side boards and into the
Buckeye zone. He dumped the
puck toward the net, looking to
give senior forward Carl Hagelin a
rebound opportunity.
Rather than a rebound, Glen-
dening picked up his second goal
of the season, as the rolling puck
hopped over Heeter's right pad to
tie the game.
"I just tried to throw it to the
middle because I saw Carl going
up," Glendening said after the
game. "I don't know, I guess you
get lucky every once in a while."
Michigan coach Red Berenson
said it was "a good sign to get a lit-
tle puck luck," adding that it was

"Let's

For one of the first times all

seemed to really get behind the
Wolverines (5-2) and after Michi-

seven, the arena was waiting for
a second-half charge to give the
season-high 9,559 fans something
to cheer about,
That's when Douglass caught
fire.

After scoring just three points
in the first half, Douglass had a
monster second stanza, scoring
16 of the Wolverines' 40 points.
On the game, he shot 5-for-7 from
behind the arc, hitting half of the
Michigan's 3-pointers.
"It's kind of just another game,
because I've had games like this
before and then I'll come out the
next day and not hita single shot,"
Douglass said after the game. "But
now I know, in my junior year, I
just have to provide whatever I
can whether it's defense, shoot-
ing, whatever the team needs at

Gator Bowl puts Michigan's
coaching farce in spotlight

Caporusso and
Wohlberg help *
Blue end drought

There's one thing that's clear
to me after waiting on
bated breath for Michigan's
bowl invitation:
Rick Catlett is the smartest man
in the room.
The Gator Bowl president's
elation at his
committee's
unanimous
choice for the
Wolverines to
play in the New
Year's Day bowl
was surprising
at first.
After all, RYAN
both Michigan KARTJE
and No. 21 Mis-
sissippi State
lost two of their last three games
and aren't exactly tearing up the
college football landscape.
The logical choice for a Big Ten
counterpart would have been Iowa,
a team that beat Michigan when the
Wolverines were playing arguably
their best football of the year and a
team whose fan base travels incred-
ibly well.
But Catlett and the rest of the
Gator Bowl selection committee
saw something stronger than a pas-
sionate fanbase - they saw dollar
signs.
Better yet, they saw dollar signs
attached to a flaming trainwreck.
And don't kid yourself, fans love
nothing more than watching immi-
nent doom unfold before their eyes.
Catlett told the Daily lastweek
that he was certain the game would ,
come downto Penn State, Iowa or
Michigan, with Penn State probably
accepting a bid to the Outback Bowl.
When it came down to Michigan
or Iowa though, there's only four
words that Catlett and the rest of
the committee probably needed to
hear: "You Raise Me Up."
At the team's banquet last

Thursday, in an effort to convince
God-only-knows-whom to sup-
port him as Michigan's coach, Rich
Rodriguez made an absolute fool
of himself, standing hand-in-hand
with his entire team and staff while
Mr. Josh Groban's song blared over
the loud speakers.
He emotionally addressed the
attendees at Laurel Manor in Livo-
nia, assuring them that he wanted
to be a Michigan Man - two words
that have clearly haunted him since
his arrival in Ann Arbor.
It was the second time Rodri-
guez had "gotten emotional" at the
podium during his tenure here -
the first being when the NCAA alle-
gations were announced. And for a
coach at the helm of America's win-
ningest college football program,
twice is two times too many.
Josh Groban himself couldn't take
the embarrassing display seriously.
@joshgroban: Coach Rodriguez,
I'm veryflattered but crying to You
Raise Me Up is SOfive years ago.
#playwelcomnetothejungle
When Josh Groban makes fun of
you for playing his own song, then
you know you've become a laugh-
ingstock.
And that's all the nation will be
thinking about come New Year's
Day at 1:30 p.m., when the Wolver-
ines kickoff in Jacksonville, Fla.
Because, let's be honest, it matters
very little to the rest of the nation
whether a 7-5 Michigan team wins
this game.
Instead, the nation will be tun-
ing in to watch Rodriguez go down
in flames. They'll be listening for
talk of his job security. They'll take
over/unders on how many times
"You Raise Me Up" is mentioned.
(Hint: take the over).
And that's exactly what's wrong
with this coaching farce. This all
could have been prevented. With
one flick of the wrist, Athletic

COLUMBUS -- The top shelf
is usually reserved for momma's
cookies, but inside Value City
Arena this weekend, it was only
filled with pucks.
In both games of the No. 11
Michigan hockey team's series
split with Ohio State, the Wolver-
ines sent the puck just under the
crossbar. For the culprits, senior
forward Louie Caporusso and
junior forward David Wohlberg,
the top shelf was the key to break
out of their goal-scoring slumps.
But more important, both goals
broke 1-1 ties in the third period.
On Friday, Caporusso carried the
puck into the Buckeye zone. After a
forehand-to-backhand deke, Capo-
russo pulled the puck wide back to
his forehand and let go of a quick
shot just inside the blue line. Ohio
State goalie Cal Heeter couldn't
even get a piece of it.
It was Caporusso's first goal
since he scored two against Alas-
ka six games ago.
"Sometimes goals, they come in
weird ways and sometimes, they
are not always going to come to
you," Caporusso said after Friday's
game. "Youjust got to keep battling
and keeping working hard you'll
get your bounces. Stay positive
that's the biggest thing because
you gotto keep shooting the puck. I
just took that shot and it happened
to find its way into the net. "
Ever since Caporusso scored
24 times in his sophomore year,
he's been expected to score big
goals for the Wolverines (8-3-1-0
CCHA, 9-5-4 overall).
Michigan hadn't scored a goal
in the third period to tie or take
the lead since early November.
And despite Michigan giving up

a late goal and losing in overtime,
Caporusso's individual effort
revealed that he can be the clutch
scorer the Wolverines desperately
need.
"I want to be looked upon,"
Caporusso said. "I like having that
pressure on me to come up big in
the big games. Hopefully I can do
that this year."
But it's been Caporusso's line-
mate, Wohlberg, who has scored
the big goals for Michigan this
season. Wohlberg scored to tie
the game with 13 seconds left a
month ago against Ferris State.
But after leading the team in goals
at the beginning of the year, he hit
a slump in November, with only
one goal and one assist since the
matchup with the Bulldogs.
On Saturday, with Michigan in
danger of getting swept by Ohio
State (3-6-1-1, 6-8-i) for the first
time since 1989, Wohlberg stepped
around the opposing center off the
faceoff, intercepted the puck and
put it on net. The puck eventu-
ally came back to Wohlberg on the
backdoor and he sent a backhand
over Heeter and into the upper
netting for the winning goal.
The goal was his seventh of the
year and his second game-win-
ning tally this season. Because of
his fast start, the slump-breaker
put him in a three-way tie for the
team lead in goals.
"He's way overdue," Berenson
said. "Here's a guy, he scored five
goals in the first seven games and
then for one reason or another he's
been snake bit, so good for him."
Wohlberg's goal also gave the
Wolverines their first win in the
past four games.
And though Michigan filling up
the top shelf didn't break mom-
ma's cookies, it did break the Wol-
verines' slumps.

Michigantcoach Rich Rodriguez walks out of Ohio Stadium after the Wolverines'
37-7 loss to Ohio Stole two weeks ago.

Director Dave Brandon could have
made this all go away.
If he wants to keep Rodriguez
for another year, it easily could have
been done by now. If he wanted
to can him and start the coaching
search, that could have been done
too. But instead, Rodriguez will
remain under the pressure cooker
while the rest of the nation laughs
and points.
And as far as I can tell, there's
only one logical reason Brandon
is sitting silently on the sidelines,
watching while Rodriguez gets
tossed around in the national
media, one reason this comedy of
errors is all worth it: Brandon is
waiting for a certain coach from

Stanford to finish coaching his bowl
game.
If that really is the case, if this
whole embarrassment was neces-
sary to ensure that Jim Harbaugh
quietly packs his bags for Ann
Arbor, then so be it. I just hope in
the long run that it was worth it for
Brandon and the program.
Because with the way this cha-
rade has been going, it sure will be
worth it for the Gator Bowl and its
viewers, who get to watch the car-
nage along the way.

Stanford AD: Harbaugh
indicated he will accept
sweetened contract deal

Youngsters impress in Las Vegas

STANFORD, Calif. (AP) - Stan-
ford athletic director Bob Bowlsby
has made a pre-emptive offer to
sweeten Jim Harbaugh's contract
before the coach even gets offered
other jobs.
"We have a proposal in front of
Jim and he's indicated he plans to
accept it," Bowlsby said Sunday.
"He's got this year and four more on
his contract. I expect that he will be
our coach in the foreseeable future."
Bowlsby spoke Sunday after the
fifth-ranked Cardinal (11-1) accept-
ed a bid to play in the Orange Bowl
against Virginia Tech on Jan. 3, a
remarkable turnaround from the
1-11 team Harbaugh took over four
years ago.
Harbaugh's name has been men-
tioned as a possible NFL coachor for
higher-profile college jobs, includ-

ing his alma mater of Michigan if
the Wolverines decide to fire Rich
Rodriguez. Michigan athletic direc-
tor Dave Brandon has said he will
not make a decision on Rodriguez
until after the Wolverines play in
their bowl game Jan. 1.
"When you have high quality
people you're going to have others
coming after him," Bowlsby said.
"Whether it's the NFL or another
university, we have to be prepared
to make pre-emptive offers and do
the things it takes to put tools in
place that make Jim or any other
coach want to stay here. In the case
of a football coach, those things tend
to be a little more expensive than
with some of our other coaches."
Harbaugh has said he will not
talk about other jobs and is happy at
Stanford.

Just two weeks after an embar-
rassing loss at Lehigh, the No. 21
Michigan wrestling team headed
to the Cliff Keen Invitatiorfal in Las
Vegas looking to bounce back. It did
just that, in abig way.
The 36-team tournament field
featured eight of the nation's top 11
teams. And the Wolverines finished
sixth, thanks to another dominant
performance from 3rd-ranked junior
Kellen Russell and a surprise run by
sophomore Ben Apland. Freshman
Dan Yates and senior Anthony Bion-
do also placed.
"We're definitely making some
strides, no question about it," Michi-
gan coach Joe McFarland said.
"Overall, considering the depth and
the quality of the teams here, if you
can be in the top 10 it's a good per-
formance. But we were capable of
more, we didn't have a good round
Saturday morning, and that hurt us a
little bit in what we were capable of.
I was really proud of the four guys
that placed."
Russell set the tone for the Wol-
verines, winning the 141 lb. weight
class. Success in Las Vegas is noth-
ing new to the junior, who placed
first and third in his previous two
appearances there.

"I wasn't really surprised by my
win," Russell said. "I've been wres-
tling pretty well and working hard. I
went into the tournament expecting
to win. It was a good tournament for
me to make a statement."
As the second seed, Russell had
highlight wins over the third seed,
Illinois's Jimmy Kennedy, and
fourth seed, Cal Poly's Boris Nova-
chov. Russell made quick work
of Kennedy, pinning him 1:16 into
the match. And after a strong start
against Novachov, he hung in long
enough to secure the championship,
3-2.
"It's not a surprise," McFarland
said. "He's solid, he's a great com-
petitor and he wants to win in the
worst way. He's willing to do what-
ever it takes to win. That's the best
way I can put it. He knows what he
needs to do to gethis hand raised."
While Russell's play came as no
surprise, Apland's performance was
arguably the top story of the week-
end. Apland, the 12th seed, stormed
through the heavyweight bracket.
He was finally defeated in the finals,
but not before knocking off three of
the top five seeds. His highlight vic-
tory came over in-state rival No. 1
Jared Trice of Central Michigan.
"It was a great (feeling) knowing
that I'm one of the top heavyweights
in the country," Apland said. "Com-

ing into this tournament, I really
wanted to make a name for myself
because I knowI'm good. I'mtrying
to prove it to other people, too. But
being a12-seed, it was nice upsetting
some of the higher seeds, which is
surprising. But deep down, I knew
I had it in me."
In the finals, a matchup of two
Cinderellas, Oklahoma's Nathan
Fernandez, the 11th-seed, came
away with a convincing 4-0 victory
over Apland.
"I think he turned a lot of heads
this weekend, and he was right there
to win the championship," McFar-
land said. "It's got to do a lot of good
things for his confidence. To come in
here and dowhathe did,it wasgreat"
Michigan benefited from sur-
prisingly strong play from another
youngster, Dan Yates. The redshirt
freshman was forced to default
out of his last match due to a knee
problem he suffered in his previ-
ous match, but his three wins were
enough to place him eighth. McFar-
land held Yates outfor precautionary
reasons and hopes that he'll be able
to compete this weekend. Despite
strong play from a few underclass-
men, some of the team's veterans left
hoping that "what happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas." Though McFarland
was pleased with what he saw out of
No. 2 Biondo, losses to two Big Ten

opponents limited him to a fourth-
place finish. Junior Zac Stevens
got off to ahot start Friday, but two
Saturday-morning losses prevented
him from placing.
"Anthony was pretty disappoint-
edwithhismatches,butIthoughthe *
battled hard," McFarland said. "He
was right there in all of his matches.
Saturday morning, I don't think Zac
had a good match. He really need-
ed to pick his intensity up and he
never got himself back in the match.
There's no reason he shouldn't have
placed this weekend, but it didn't
work out for him. You just can't
make big mistakes in a tournament
like this."
The Wolverines now turn their
attention to next Sunday's Big Ten
opener with Wisconsin. The fourth-
ranked Badgers finished second in
Las Vegas. The meet in Madison
will have two sets of rematches
from the Invitational, where Apland
knocked off No. 4 Eric Bugenhagen
and junior Justin Zeerip was defeat-
ed by No. 9 Benjamin Jordan.
"Obviously, we had a good chance
to see Wisconsin this past weekend,"
McFarland said. "We were battling
with them and they've got a great
team. We've just got to be ready to
wrestle up there. We'll have to have 0
some guys extend themselves and
wrestle tough with a lot of grit."

Blue unable to repeat last year's comeback *

By ALEX STEINHOFF
For TheDaily
Entering the final day of com-
petition, the Wolverines had their
opponents right where they want-
ed them. Or so they thought.
Last year at the USA Swim-
ming Short Course Nationals, the
Michigan men's swimming team
was in second after two days, only
to come from behind and clinch a
second consecutive Short Course
Nationals win. This year, how-
ever, the third day wasn't as kind.
The Wolverines couldn't complete
the three-peat and finished sec-
ond to rival and host Ohio State.
But the Wolverines were con-
tent with their second place fin-
ish, given the circumstances. This
year, the team competed in many
more events than it had in the
past two years at the Short Course
Nationals, which meant less rest
and more swimming.
Junior Dan Madwed was the
lone Wolverine to medal at this

year's Short Course, finishing
third in the 200-yard butterfly.
For Madwed, who was a member
of Michigan's previous two Short
Course champion teams, the meet
wasn't about medaling or even
coming in second place as a team
- it was about learning what this
team has going forward and how
hard it can push itself.
"We swam in as many events as
possible," Madwed said. "Other
teams didn't do that and scratched
some events, but we really wanted
to see what we have for later in the
year. You never know how hard
you can push yourself until you do
it."
The Wolverines didn't view the
event as a must-win, but rather
as a chance to improve and bond
together as a team. The Short
Course Nationals was the last
opportunity for Blue, before the
Orange Bowl Classic in January, to
see what theyhad in the tank.
"We treated this like a train-
ing meet to see what we have for

later in the year," Madwed said. "I
think it was a good step forward
although it may not look like it."
For many swimmers, the meet
was a great learning experience.
Freshman Kyle Whitaker was
among the many swimmers who
stepped up and contributed to the
Wolverines' effort.
He notched a fourth-place
finish in the 400-yard individ-
ual medley, sixth place in the 200-
yard individual medley and also a
12th-place finish in the 200-yard
butterfly.
Whitaker was the highest scor-
er of all Wolverine swimmers this
weekend.
"Confidence and being excit-
ed really helps swimming fast,"
Whitaker said. "We really did a
great job of supporting each other,
and getting behind each other."
This great team spirit didn't
go unnoticed by Michigan coach
Mike Bottom.
"(Finishing second) this week-
end was a matter of swimming

against teams that were ready to
go," Bottom said. "The fact that
we were able to compete against
more prepared teams gives us the
confidence that we can step up and
swim against anybody."
Despite losing to the Buckeyes,
the second-place finish gave them
swimmers confidence moving for-
ward.
For some swimmers, they
learned their limits. For others,
they learned what it takes to win
races.
But for all swimmers, this
weekend gave a taste of competi-
tion they'll be facing all season
and a great deal of confidence to
go with it.
"When you do good jobs in
races, you build confidence,"
Whitaker said. "Swimming fast
also really builds our confidence
and confidence helps with swim-
ming fast. It comes hand in hand.
Where we are at this point in the
season we were really happy with
how we swam."

Sophomore midfielder Hamoody
Saad dribbled into the box and saw
freshman midfielder Fabio Pereira
streaking to his right, toward the
net. After a perfectly timed cross
from Saad, Pereira scored the first
goal of his young career.
"I don't usually make those
runs," Pereira said. "I was wide
open, so I got a little happy there."
Maryland dominated the
game's early stages (19-3-1). But
when the early goal finally came
for the Terps - a blast from Tra-
verse City, Mich. native Casey
Townsend that barely found the
side netting - neither Burns nor
his players showed any alarm.
When the Wolverines made
their way back onto the field for
the second half, they played with
a fearless mentality. In the half's
opening moments, it became clear
that Michigan (17-4-3) was going
to get its chances. The Terrapin
student section, located direct-
ly behind Michigan goalkeeper
Chris Blais, mercilessly taunted
him with cheers that would make
many blush. But Blais kept his
cool, accumulating seven saves -
each one needed to prevent the
Terrapins from cruising to the
tournament's next round.
Four minutes into the half, a
deflected throw in found Wolver-
ine defender Jeff Quijano open
from 16 yards out. His shot made
its way through the defense and
past a screened goalie for his first

goal in the NCAA Tournament,
while they have surrendered two.
No team so far, though, has
had an answer for Michigan's
second-half onslaught. The team
has outscored opponents 8-2 after
halftime in its three tournament
games.
On Saturday, the second-seed-
ed Terrapins were in complete
control of the match for the first
45 minutes.
Five saves by redshirt junior
goalkeeper Chris Blais and a few
squandered opportunities by
Maryland (19-3-1) kept Michigan,
the 10th seed, hanging around.
"We thought that we were
right still in the game at the half,"
Burns said. "We needed to get
our attacks forward ... Once we
were able to get the pressure off
of us and established on them,
that's when the chances started to
come."
Burns, as he always seems to
do, made the necessary changes
at halftime to put his team in posi-
tion to score. The comeback victo-
ry marked the first time all season
that Maryland had surrendered a
lead.
"Maryland is very good,"
Burns said. "They've done a great
job with being able to press you
in your back half of the field. We
felt that we could play through a
lot of that pressure, but we also
had to recognize when he needed
to go back at them with coun-
ters and with direct play. And

we needed Justin Meram ... and
Soony (Saad) to be able to secure
the ball."
Added Meram: "By me drop-
ping (back on defense), we didn't
have to go long every time. It
helped the rhythm. once we had
rhythm and we're playing at our
best, not many people can stop us."
Michigan came out of the break
with that rhythm, looking like a
different team. Accordingly, its
scoring came from some different
sources.
Maryland held the "Three Ami-
gos" - Meram, sophomore Ham-
oody Saad and freshman Soony
Saad - to an unusually low 10
shots combined. Neither Quijano
nor freshman midfielder Fabio
Pereira had tallied a goal this
season before Saturday, but each
contributed one against the Ter-
rapins.
Quijano came out of the break
looking like a different player.
Apart from being a disruptive
force on defense all day for the
Wolverines, his score took a world
of pressure off the team.
"I felt like I was due for a goal,"
Quijano said. "Coach told me at
halftime, he told me I gotta keep
it up, I gotta keep playing well....
The goal was actually a bit funny
because the ball was flying in the
air, I saw Soony coming in to wind
up and take it. I mean, Soony's got
19 goals, you figured I should let
him take the shot. But something
told me I need to hit this one, and
it went in.
"It feels awesome. I came
through for my team and that's all
I really wanted to do."

Senior Jeff Quijano scared the first of Michgan's twa secend-half toals in the Wolverines' upset of No. 3 Maryland.

goal of the season. It couldn't have
come at a more opportune time for
Michigan.
"I felt something in me," Qui-
jano said. "I had a certain feeling
that I just knew something was
going to happen."
The Michigan attack didn't let
up following the equalizer. Hun-
gry for more, senior forward Justin
Meram took a pass from Quijano
and ran with it. After he found the
far post for what was the go-ahead
goal, the Maryland student section
became noticeably quieter, sensing
the suddenly more imminent threat
the Wolverines posed for the RPI's
top-ranked squad.
The momentum shifted toward
the Michigan faithful, including

the Ultras - the Wolverines' soc-
cer student section - 20 or so of
whom made the 521-mile trip to
witness history.
But the Terrapins' equally
impressive attack wouldn't go
down without a fight.
After several near-misses, the
breakthrough finally came in the
79th minute when Maryland fifth-
year senior Jason Herrick renewed
hope that the Terrapins would be
able to escape unscathed.
The 2-2 stalemate continued
into the second overtime, despite a
continued onslaught of shots from
Maryland. The Terrapins had a
33-18 advantage in that category
for the game.
But just three minutes into the

period, Pereira decided enough
was enough. Pandemonium set
in as his golden goal punched the
Wolverines' ticket to Santa Bar-
bara, Calif.
Michigan is now set to battle
Akron in the first round of the
College Cup on Friday night. This
means a rematch for the Wolver-
ines, who lost to the Zips 7-1 ear-
lier this season. But the past isn't a
focal point for Michigan.
"I haven't thought about (a
rematch) much," Burns said. "The
Akron game was a turning point
for us though. That was where
we were exposed for not being a
strong enough defensive team, and
from that point on, we've focused
on that."

changes and clawed their way
back from a 12-point deficit in the
second half while other scorers
struggled.
Freshmen Tim Hardaway Jr.
and Evan Smotrycz, two of the
team's top four scorers so far this
season, shot a combined 1-for-12
from the field, accounting for less
than 5 percent of the team's scor-
ing output. Up until this game,
the duo had contributed to nearly
one third of the team's offensive
production.
"We're talking about leaving
the baggage behind and moving
on to the next play," Smotrycz
said after the game. "Coach was
just talking to us, and he crum-
pled up the stat sheet and said,
'On to the next one.' "
The game provided an interest-
ing opponent for both Douglass
and Michigan coach John Beilein.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker
coached the Wolverines from
2001 until 2007, when he was
replaced by Beilein. Upon arriv-
ing at Harvard, Amaker heavily
recruited Douglass but ultimately
lost him to Beilein.
In the second half, Amaker
attacked the Wolverines by put-
ting four shooters on the perim-
eter and leaving just Keith
Wright in the middle for the
Crimson. This move sent play-
ers like Smotrycz and redshirt
freshman Blake McLimans to the
bench, allowing for quicker guard
defenders, and moved junior Zack
Novak back to a post-like posi-
tion. But the change opened space
in the lane and allowed Novak to
collect a team-high and season-
high 11 rebounds, all of which
were defensive boards. He also
scored 12 points, giving him his
first career double-double.
"I don't think we're that type
of team where you say, 'We're
going to get the ball to these
guys and we're going to play off
of them,' " Beilein said of Dou-
glass and Novak's step-up per-
formance in the Harvard game.

"I think we're playing off the
way people play us. ... There are
all these things we look at. We
couldn't run our regular stuff..
Tommy (Amaker) just took us out
of everything."
Amaker knew what it would
take to defeat his old program.
Three years ago, the Crimson
triumphed over Michigan in
Boston, 62-51, in a similar back-
and-forth game in which the Wol-
verines were unable to keep their
momentum. But even in the last
year, Michigan has made strides
in working to keep its momentum
together in tight games, shown
hnth by the mnlarinPC, win nn

Saturday and the road win at
Clemson.
"Sometimes, last year, things
started to not go our way and it
kind of just crumbled," Douglass
said of the Wolverines' play in
tight games. "But today, we came
together and fought for 40 min-
utes."
Michigan looks to defend
their homecourt for the next
seven games - they won't have
to play on any opposing team's
floor until Jan. 5 when they face
Wisconsin in Madison. Next on
the list is Concordia College,

well deserved since the goal did
come on the Wolverines' 38th shot
of the contest.
"There was a sense that sooner
or later one was going to go in, but
you don't expect it to go in like
that," Berenson said. "That goal
was a big goal. Every goal is a big
goal when you get 40-some shots
and you only score twice."
And with less than six minutes
to play, good fortune struck again
for Michigan.
Junior forward David Wohlberg
took a faceoff deep in the Ohio
State zone, and although he lost it,
senior forward Louie Caporusso
* managed to get a shot on goal. The
rebound trickled to the left side of
the crease, where Wohlberg cor-
ralled it and lifted the puck into
the open net.
Wohlberg conceded after the
game that he "got lucky," but it
was a case of being in the right
place at the right time.
The Wolverines weren't home
free just yet, though. The Buck-
eyes had several golden oppor-
tunities to knot the score in
the final minutes, including a
shorthanded breakaway chance
that senior goalie Bryan Hogan
pushed aside.
And like Friday's matchup,
Michigan held a 2-1 lead when
Heeter was pulled with a minute
and a half remaining. On both
nights, a Wolverine player was
issued a minor penalty in the final
minute to give the Buckeyes a
6-on-4 advantage.
In the final minute on Saturday
with a man in the penalty box, the
scene looked all too familiar for
the Wolverines.
"I was talking to some of the
guys on the ice, who were say-
ing, 'Oh, here we go again,' "

Hogan said.
Added Wohlberg: "T thought it
was going to be a rerun of (Friday)
night."
The Buckeyes (3-6-1-1, 6-8-1)
were on the doorstep in the final
minute, and when senior defense-
man Chad Langlais was whistled
for slashing with four seconds left,
they took a three-man advantage.
Berenson admitted that he
feared another last-minute break-
down when the Wolverines were
sent to the penalty box.
"After what happened (Fri-
day) night, you just don't want to
repeat," Berenson said. "I've been

in this rink too many times where
you've had it happen too many
times. ... It's amazing how many
times we've had last minute, last-
minute scenarios that have gone
one way or have gone the other way.
At least tonight, it went our way."
But Hogan closed the book on
the series by making the last of his
24 saves. Hogan picked up the win
on Saturday, but he knew the team
was "fortunate."
With the Big Chill at the Big
House approaching this weekend,
weather and ice conditions could
lead to a lot more puck luck for
Michigan.

could submarine the Wolverines'
strength of schedule.

Former coach Tommy Amaker
returns as Harvard headman

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Blue fades down
the stretch inloss
to hot Iowa State

ByZAK PYZIK
Daily Sports Writer
Harvard men's basketball
coach Tommy Amaker returned
Saturday to Crisler Arena for
the first time since being fired
from the Michi-
gan program in NOTEBOOK
2007. And when
Amaker's name was announced at
the start of the game, he received
applause - a classy showing from
the fans.
Amaker said in a teleconfer-
ence last Thursday that he didn't
know how he would be greeted in
his return to Ann Arbor, but in the
Wolverines' 65-62 win over the
Crimson on Saturday, he saw noth-
ing but respect from the Michigan
fan base.
In fact, there wasn't a single
chant from the Maize Rage all
afternoon targeting the opposing
coach - something that normally
happens multiple times in a game.
"It's kind of weird knowing that
he helped get you here," junior
guard Stu Douglass, whom Amak-
er tried to recruit to Harvard, said
after Saturday's game. "When I
saw him, I just said hi and good
luck.
"We just went out there to get a
win for our coach."
Amaker embraced his opportu-
nity to return to Michigan.
"We were so focused on the way
we've been playing, and I think
our kids were focused on that
as well, so I tried to stay in that
moment for our guys," Amaker
said on Saturday. "But it certainly
is always great to come back to
Ann Arbor. It's a great community,
a great town.
"I enjoyed my time here as a
coach and being a part of this great
school."
A TALE OF TWO HALVES: The
Wolverines went into halftime
trailing by seven points.
But Michigan coach John
Beilein made some adjustments
to respond to Amaker's defensive
attack and started Douglass in the
second half.
"Douglass played very well in
the second half," Amaker said on
Saturday. "I thought he shot the
ball really well. I'll wait to look
at the tape to see if we lost him a
few times. Sure, they missed some
opportunities to finish around the
goal as well, but we just couldn't
finish around the basket. I thought

Before Sunday's contest against
the Michigan women's basketball
team, No.19 Iowa State had won 51
straight
regular MICHIGAN 47
season IOWA STATE 60
non-con-
ference home games - a stretch
that goes all the way back to
December of 2003.
And after the game at Hilton
Coliseum, the Cyclones made it 52
straight with a 60-47 victory over
the Wolverines in front of a crowd
of 11,829 rowdy Iowa State fans.
But for much of the game, the
Cyclones' (6-1) streak looked like
it was in jeopardy.
Playing in front of more fans
than it has seen in three total home
games this season, Michigan (4-4)
didn't looked phased early on.
"It was pretty intense," senior
guard Veronica Hicks said of
the crowd. "There were so many
people screaming, so it was kind
of hard to communicate. You just
had to block out what is going on
around you."
Hicks silenced the crowd
early, scoring four of the Wolver-
ines' first eight points and grab-
bing their first three rebounds as
Michigan took an early 8-7 lead.
But after getting called for her
second foul with just under 13
minutes left in the first, Hicks was
forced to tone down her aggres-
sive play.
"It made me a little more cau-
tious when I was defending the
ball," Hicks said. "Offensively, I
didn't want to cause anythingthat
would make them call a charge or
anythinglike that. I didn'twant to
force anything."
With Hicks in foul trouble,
the Wolverines found a way to
take control of the game midway
through the first half.
After Iowa State guard Kelsey
Harris hit a 3-pointer to give the
Cyclones a 15-14 lead, Michi-
gan responded with an 8-0 run,
capped by a layup from sopho-
more Sam Arnold to give the Wol-
verines a seven-point lead with
just over six minutes left.

But Iowa State responded.
Senior sharpshooter Kelsey Bolte
drilled a 3-pointer to end the
drought for the Cyclones, and
with just six seconds left, junior
guard Lauren Mansfield drove the
length of the court and hit a layup
at the buzzer to give Iowa State a
26-24 lead heading into the break.
"That is absolutely inexcus-
able," Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth said after the game.
"(Mansfield) was left-handed, and
we just let her go left and score."
Even after the Cyclones' 9-0
run to end the half, Michigan
was still only down by two. And
a 3-pointer by sophomore Jenny
Ryan tied the game at 34 with just
under 12 minutes to play.
But down the stretch, Iowa
State proved to be too much for
the Wolverines. Bolte caught
fire, converting on three critical
3-pointers in the game's most cru-
cial minutes.
"We wanted to guard her closer
than that," Borseth said of Bolte,
who averages more than 16 points
per game. "She got 20 shots off in
situations that, in my opinion, are
inexcusable. We should have cov-
ered her a lot better than we did."
Michigan still hung around
until the closing minutes. Hicks
hit a 3-pointer at the three-minute
mark to cut the deficit to five, but
6-foot-7 sophomore Anna Prins
responded with a 3-pointer of her
own on the other end.
The Cyclones dominated the
offensiveboards downthe stretch,
eliminating any chance of a Wol-
verine comeback as Iowa State
finished with a 43-31 advantage on
the glass.
For Michigan, this is one that
slipped away. The Wolverines shot
just 2-for-9 from behind the arc in
the second half, compared to the
Cyclones' 7-of-14. Michigan also
got just four points out of its nor-
mally reliable bench.
"We did a good job defensively
of holding them down and not
giving them great looks," Borseth
said. "We got sloppy late in the
game defensively and then didn't
answer offensively. We had good
looks. We were wide open and just
didn't convert."

Former Michigan coach Tommy Amaker went to Harvard after being fired from Michigan in 2007.

that was the difference, just not
being able to score."
Douglass tallied 16 of his 19
points in the second stanza. He
shot 5-for-7 from three-point
range, two of which were well
beyond the arc.
"He got some open shots, and he
got some non-open shots and he
just knocked them down," junior
guard Zack Novak said on Satur-
day. "I think he is embracing his
sixth man (role). He's coming off
the bench and giving us such a
huge spark, it's big for us. I mean
he won us the game today."
Michigan shot 50 percent from
three-point territory in the second
half, but just 28 percent in the first
half.
POSTGAME ANALYSIS: Crim-
son forward Keith Wright scored
a team-high 18 points, 16 of which

came when Michigan redshirt
freshman Jordan Morgan covered
him.
But when Morgan got into foul
trouble, Beilein played redshirt
freshman Blake McLimans in his
spot.
The forward covered Wright
effectively and limited him to just
two points, both on free throws.
On the other end, McLimans tal-
lied four points of his own, a
rebound and a block in the seven
minutes that he had played.
"Blake has really benefited
from embracing the process from
his development," assistant coach
Bacari Alexander said. "It's nice
when you can see the benefit from
that embracement. You can see
what happened from the practices
leading up from the game. Blake
today had a hot moment where

he figured out angles, competing,
scrapping and fighting.
"Wright is a load right there, he
is first team, all caliber IVY league
player, and Blake accepted the
challenge. He used his length and
his size and those are things that
we have been emphasizing."
McLimans and the rest of the
Michigan bench scored 30 points
against Harvard, the biggest con-
tribution the team has seen from
its bench all season.
"We have a saying at Michigan
this year where we need all hands
on deck," Alexander said. "So
whether it's Blake McLimans one
night or Eso the next night. Name
a player.
"Everyone on our roster has a
valuable role, and we are going to
call on them when the time dic-
tates it."

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
M' starts season with intrasquad

AD Brandon a
celebrity judge
at annual Maize vs.
Blue meet
By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Writer
Seven freshmen took to the floor
in Crisler Arena on Sunday after-
noon, ready to compete in their
first collegiate meet.
Luckily for them, the pressure
was off. The Michigan women's
gymnastics team held its annual
Maize vs. Blue Intrasquad meet,
pitting the athletes against one
another for some friendly compe-
tition.
The Maize team took the win,
beating the Blue team, 7-6, after
dominating the final routine in

floor exercise.
The meet's decision came down
to two-time All-American senior
Kylee Botterman and All-Ameri-
can sophomore Natalie Beilstein -
the same matchup from last year's
tie-breaking floor event.
Botterman came out on top, pro-
viding Maize the victory and earn-
ing top scores from the celebrity
judges: Michigan Athletic Direc-
tor David Brandon and Michigan
Insider radio personalities Sam
Webb and Ira Weintraub.
"We showcased some of our
depth and it was a chance to see
how some of our gymnasts per-
form in competition," Michigan
coach Bev Plocki said afterward.
Tori Kane was the only fresh-
man to earn a point for her team
after performing the final balance
beam routine of the day.
Fifth-year senior captain Sarah
Curtis, who has competed in the

all-around the past three years,
kicked off her final season as
a Wolverine by giving the Blue
team a point in three of her four
events.
"This will be the fourth year
doing it, so it's pretty normal for
me, although I can't say it gets eas-
ier every year," Curtis said of her
all-around competition.
Senior captain Jordan Sexton
also took to the floor, taking points
for the Maize team in both the
bars and floor exercise.
The Wolverines boast a.division
of experience, as its 15-player ros-
ter includes five seniors and seven
freshmen - Michigan's biggest
freshman class in 20 years.
"The seniors are vital to the
success of our team this year and
getting all these freshmen on the
right path, keeping them under
their wing," Plocki said. "They've
been doing a great job so far."

Michigan has won 17 of the last
19 Big Ten titles, including last
year's, and the team looks to con-
tinue its conference domination
this season.
But before that can happen,
Plocki is hoping for a completely
healthy team.
"We have three athletes - one
sophomore and two freshmen -
who are injured and were not able
to perform today," Plocki said.
"But they should be able -to get
healthy sometime in January.
"There are freshmen that have
great stuff, but that nobody got to
see today. I can't wait to put them
into the lineup."
