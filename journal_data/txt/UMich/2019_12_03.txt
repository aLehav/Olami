Current 
faculty 
member 
Emily 
Lawsin 
and 
former 
faculty 
member 
Scott 
Kurashige 
filed 
a 
discrimination 
lawsuit 
in 
2016 against the University of 
Michigan under the Elliott-
Larsen Civil Rights Act. Their 
trial began yesterday at 9 a.m. 
at the Washtenaw County 
Court and it is scheduled to 
continue until December 23.
Kurashige and Lawsin are 
seeking more than $25,000 
in damages to compensate 
for emotional distress, loss of 
reputation and lost salaries.
They cite a “hostile work 
environment for faculty of 
color and women” at the 
University, 
“(p)atterns 
of 
racial 
discrimination 
in 
faculty hiring” within the 
Department 
of 
American 
Culture 
and 
racial 
discrimination in leadership 
selection 
and 
promotion, 
among other things, in their 
lawsuit. 
They 
also 
claim 
the Office of Institutional 
Equity failed to investigate 
the Kurashige’s complaints of 

discrimination in a just and 
efficient manner.
Lawsin is a lecturer IV 
in 
the 
Women’s 
Studies 
and 
American 
Culture 
departments and Kurashige 
was a tenured professor and 
the director of the Asian/
Pacific 
Islander 
American 
Studies Program before he left 
in 2014. Both began working 
at the University in 2000.
Kurashige 
was 
removed 
from his position as director 
of the A/PIA Studies program 
and said he felt pressured to 
quit his tenured position. He 
now works as a professor at 
the University of Washington. 
Kurashige 
additionally 
seeks reinstatement to both 
his former positions at the 
University.
They are being represented 
by attorneys Alice Jennings 
and Carl Edwards of Edwards 
and Jennings PC, a law firm 
based in Detroit.
The United Asian American 
Organizations 
released 
a 
statement 
on 
Sunday 
in 
support 
of 
Lawsin 
and 
Kurashige in their lawsuit 
and urged students to attend 
the trial to show support. 

Last 
month, 
students 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
published the first issue of 
The Michigan Gayly: LGBTQ+ 
Issues, a newspaper dedicated to 
publishing articles related to the 
LGBTQ+ community. 
Established this October, the 
organization is currently made 
up of about 20 undergraduate 
and 
graduate 
students 
and 
publishes an issue every month. 
Students can pick up copies of 
the newspaper at the Spectrum 
Center and the campus dorms. 
LSA 
freshman 
Shoshana 
Weinstein, 
editor-in-chief 
of 
The Michigan Gayly, said she 
came up with the idea for the 

newspaper because she felt like 
there was not enough attention 
on the policy and the legislation 
that surrounds LGBTQ+ rights 
in the media and on campus. She 
was pleasantly surprised to see 
the excitement among others in 
the community to contribute to 
the newspaper.
“I hadn’t realized there was 
such a hunger within the LGBT 
community to be able to tell 
our stories,” Weinstein said. “I 
thought maybe people would 
want to do an issue or two; I 
wasn’t really sure if there was 
going to be enough support or 
momentum to keep it going. But 
people immediately responded 
really passionately with all 
these things that they cared 
about.” 
LSA freshman Adrian Beyer 

said he became a staff writer 
because he was intrigued by 
the student-run nature of the 
publication, created by people 
who felt strongly about the rights 
of the LGBTQ+ community. 
“This is a group of people who 
just cared really passionately 
about having a newspaper and 
publishing queer voices,” Beyer 
said. “And I think it’s really 
important too, because a lot of 
other publications might shy 
away from some of those stories, 
but here, it’s kind of a chance 
to really be uncensored and say 
what you want to say.”
According to the University 
of Michigan Maize Pages, The 
Michigan Gayly is the only 
newspaper 
on 
campus 
that 
publishes stories solely dedicated 
to the LGBTQ+ community. The 

newspaper has articles about 
politics, business, sports, health 
and more, all relating to the 
community. 
LSA 
freshman 
Edha 
Shirodkar, the news editor of the 
publication, said The Michigan 
Gayly is important in terms of 
giving students in the LGBTQ+ 
community the representation 
they deserve on campus. It made 
her feel more comfortable with 
her own identity because she 
was able to find comfort in a 
group of people who understood 
some of the experiences she had 
gone through.
The newspaper also features 
articles about writers’ coming 
out stories and other personal 
experiences.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Each month, The Michigan 
Daily’s 
Administration 
Beat 
sits 
down 
with 
University 
of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel to discuss important 
questions 
about 
University 
policy, 
commitments 
and 
challenges. Topics discussed at 
this month’s interview included 
the President’s Commission on 
Carbon Neutrality, The Detroit 
Center 
for 
Innovation, 
the 

discrimination 
lawsuit 
filed 
against the University and more.
At the beginning of the meeting, 
The Daily also spoke with 
Jennifer Haverkamp, director 
of the Graham Sustainability 
Institute and co-chair of the 
President’s 
Commission 
on 
Climate Neutrality, about the 
Commission’s 
first 
interim 
report 
that 
was 
released 
Monday morning. Haverkamp 
said the report includes input 
from over 90 individuals and 
highlights the first phase of the 
Commission’s work, which is 
focused on devising strategies 
to 
reach 
carbon 
neutrality 
and 
planning 
for 
potential 

obstacles in the future. Some 
of the goals include creating a 
Carbon Accounting Subgroup to 
estimate the amount of methane 
leakage 
in 
the 
University’s 
natural gas supply chain, hiring 
an external consulting firm to 
suggest ways to reach carbon 
neutrality and adding the Flint 
and Dearborn campuses to the 
objectives. 
The Michigan Daily: How 
will the carbon neutrality goals 
translate over to the Detroit 
Innovation Center?
Mark Schlissel: That’s a 
really interesting question. So 
since the Detroit Center is quite 
a new concept, and actually 

it hasn’t been fully designed, 
and there’s not a shovel in 
the ground, I don’t know. But 
yeah, there are opportunities 
to make that a model building. 
And the folks that are doing 
the development are thinking 
along those lines. Once we 
know what we’re going to 
do, we’ll announce it ... the 
buildings being built by outside 
developers that will be donated 
to the university. So although 
we have input into the building, 
we won’t have control of it until 
it’s complete and given to us as 
a gift.

Discrimination lawsuit over violation 
of state civil rights law heads to court

The University of Michigan 
President’s Commission on Carbon 
Neutrality released its first interim 
progress report in an email to 
students Monday morning. The 
report details the commission’s 
progress on its goal to develop 
recommendations 
for 
reducing 
carbon emissions on campus by 
2025.
In an interview with The Daily 
Monday, 
Jennifer 
Haverkamp, 
co-chair 
of 
the 
President’s 
Commission on Carbon Neutrality, 
discussed the contents of the report. 
According 
to 
Haverkamp, 
the 
document contains input from more 
than 90 individuals, including the 
commission’s members as well as 
faculty and students from advisory 
and analysis groups working with 
the commission.
“(The report) is reflecting the 
first phase of our work, which was 
focused on defining the challenges 
in reaching carbon neutrality and 
planning on how we address those 
challenges,” Haverkamp said.
Since 
Schlissel 
announced 
the creation of the Commission 
in February of this year, the 
commissioners have met 12 times. 
The Commission has held three 
public forums at the Ann Arbor 
campus to receive input from the 
community, and it has also created 
an online form for U-M community 

members 
to 
leave 
comments 
directed at the commission.
One key development in the 
Commission’s 
work 
was 
the 
formation of eight internal analysis 
teams 
to 
investigate 
different 
opportunities for decarbonization. 
The teams, composed of faculty 
and student research assistants 
from 
all 
three 
University 
of 
Michigan campuses, include: bio 
sequestration, which focuses on 
finding University land for carbon 
sequestration 
projects; 
building 
standards; campus culture and 
communication; 
commuting; 
energy 
consumption; 
external 
collaboration; food; and university 
travel for faculty, staff and students.
Beyond the internal analysis 
teams, the Commission has also 
hired Integral Group, an external 
firm 
that 
analyzes 
building 
energy infrastructure to enhance 
sustainability, to present a plan to 
eliminate carbon emissions from 
heat and power systems across all 
three campuses.
Though the current sustainability 
goals for greenhouse gas reduction 
only addresses scope one and 
scope two emissions — those 
generated on campus or through 
purchased electricity — the report 
states the Commission intends to 
also make recommendations for 
reducing scope three emissions that 
indirectly relate to the University’s 
operations.

The Michigan Gayly provides 
outlet for LGBTQ+ community 

New publication features students’ personal experiences, stories


The University of Michigan’s 
plan for its Detroit Center 
for Innovation, announced in 
October, has generated mixed 
responses from the campus 
community, 
with 
some 
students creating a petition 
condemning the center as a 
sign of gentrification. The 
Daily 
spoke 
with 
several 
Detroit residents about their 
views on the Center.. 
The Center for Innovation 
will be built on the site 
formerly 
set 
aside 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
proposed Wayne County Jail. 
Construction of the jailcame 
to a halt in 2013 after going $91 
million over its initial $300 
million budget.
University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald said the University 
aims to attract businesses 

and entrepreneurs to Detroit 
through 
the 
Center 
for 
Innovation. 
“This new Detroit Center 
for Innovation enhances that 
legacy by meeting another 
pressing 
need 
— 
helping 
to 
further 
the 
economic 
development of the city and 
the region,” Fitzgerald wrote. 
“As the president wrote in 
his message to the campus 
community last month, the 
university will help provide a 
pipeline of talent and platform 
for 
research 
collaboration 
to help grow and attract 
businesses and entrepreneurs, 
while positioning the future 
workforce for success in a 
dynamic 
and 
diversified 
economy.”
A majority of the concerns 
about the center lie around the 
building’s impact on Detroit 
residents. 
The 
petition, 
titled “#UMichRegentrifiers: 

Invest in Detroiters” stated 
the University’s decision to 
spearhead the center “signals 
its priorities in Detroit do 
not lie with Detroiters.” The 
petition said the University’s 
investment 
in 
Detroit 
Renaissance 
Real 
Estate 
Fund LP, a firm with ties to a 
string of evictions in Detroit, 
was a sign of the University’s 
lack of genuine commitment 
to the city. It also claimed 
the 
University 
was 
more 
invested 
in 
gentrification 
and 
furthering 
business 
interests 
than 
supporting 
Detroit residents. Staff of 
the University’s Semester in 
Detroit program also released 
a statement questioning the 
Center’s intentions.
LSA 
junior 
Oluwakemi 
Dauda, 
who 
graduated 
from the Benjamin Carson 
High 
School 
of 
Science 
and Medicine in Detroit in 
2017, said she, too, has 
questions and concerns 
about the building that 
have yet to be answered. 
“Being a site that has 
had so many promises 
for it, but that they 
failed, I am concerned 
if this amazing idea of 
an 
Innovation 
Center 
is going to actually fall 
through,” Dauda said. 
“My only other concern 
is how it will impact 
the 
Detroit 
residents. 
How does that impact 
residents from Detroit 
being able to have access 
to the Center, even if 
they are not students? 
Are 
people 
who 
are 
students from U of M 
who are from Detroit, 
do they have access to 
this center? How will it 
affect people who live 
around this center?” 
Dauda told The Daily 
she sees potential in 
the Detroit Center for 
helping Detroit residents 
and she hopes that the 

University sees that potential 
too. 
“I really hope that they are 
seeing more as a way to create 
impact and not money,” Dauda 
said. “Although, of course, 
them being entrepreneurs and 
businessmen, that’s always in 
the back of their head. But I 
feel when it comes to initiative 
for a new business plan, like 
the Innovation Center, I feel 
like the forefront of their 
minds should be that and not 
the financials that come after 
it.”
LSA 
freshman 
Chanel 
Barnes 
attended 
Cass 
Technical High School in 
Detroit, which is close to 
the proposed location of the 
Innovation 
Center. 
Barnes 
said her experience at the 
University has really showed 
her 
how 
much 
Detroit 
Public Schools are lacking in 
providing a quality education. 
She also said people often 
come to downtown Detroit 
and 
take 
resources 
that 
residents need. 
Barnes 
said 
she 
thinks 
the new building does not 
have any direct initiative for 
students in the Detroit Public 
School system and will have 
greater 
benefit 
for 
those 
outside of Detroit.
“It 
seems 
like 
they’re 
putting more of the building 
on people who are not of lower 
income. It seems like it is 
going to students who have a 
higher privilege of education,” 
Barnes said. “It is in the 
downtown area, so I see it will 
have an impact on the local 
students and community in 
general. But I won’t say it will 
have a positive impact.”
Thomas Page, a Detroit 
native and Los Angeles Police 
Department 
retiree, 
has 
returned to Michigan after 
retiring and now works in the 
community by leading bike 
rides around Detroit.

Detroit residents reflect on new 
building, impact of gentrification

Plans for construction of Center for Innovation sparks criticism, conversation

See DETROIT, Page 3


The University aims to reduce 
scope one and scope two carbon 
emissions to 25 percent below 2006 
levels by 2025.
According to the report, the 
Commission is entering the second 
phase of its work, which will center 
around compiling the findings of 
the internal and external teams and 
presenting recommendations to 
the commission for decarbonizing 
the campus. This phase will 
continue into the spring of 2020, 
with the third and final phase 
focusing on the delivery of the 
report to president Schlissel by fall 
of 2020. 
While the report provides ample 
evidence of the Commission’s 
progress towards achieving carbon 
neutrality, activists on campus 
remain critical of the Commission.
Rackham student Sasha Bishop, 
an 
Ecology 
and 
Evolutionary 
Biology student and an organizer 
for Climate Action Movement, 
criticized the Commission for not 
acting urgently, and for a lack of 
transparency with the general 
public.
“The Commission is simply not 
acting with the urgency that this 
issue warrants,” Bishop said. “One 
of the major complaints coming out 
is that there’s really no path right 
now for implementing community 
or student input. They’re at this 

point not responding to any 
community requests to meet. They 
make claims of having a student 
advisory panel in the report, but 
there’s no indication that they’ve 
met with the student advisory panel 
for the last 8 months (10 months) 
since its formation… there’s no 
indication of integration or follow 
up of the recommendations in 
those public forums.”
Zaynab 
Elkolaly, 
a 
student 
at 
Washtenaw 
Technical 
Middle College and cofounder 
of Washtenaw Climate Strike, 
took issue with the University’s 
investments in fossil fuels and 
what she characterized as a lack 
of a response to the community’s 
input.
“The work that the commission 
has done so far is a step in the 
right direction, but it is not 
enough,” Elkolaly said. “With the 
president claiming to spearhead 
this initiative, the situation looks 
rather laughable because of the 
fact that the university has yet to 
divest from fossil fuels… I’m glad 
that there’s dialogue, but that’s 
all it is: dialogue. What I’m seeing 
here is community outreach and 
administrative strategy, not the 
radical change that we need to be 
seeing from the commission in 
order to truly align with the goal of 
fighting change.”

Weinstein said these stories 
are crucial for those who are 
still discovering their identities 
because they can read these 
articles and see they are not 
alone. 
Beyer went to a high school 
with 
very 
few 
openly 
gay 
students. He explained that if he 
wanted talk about queer issues, it 
was always a test to see how far 
he could go before his teachers 
said they didn’t understand his 
comments or before they became 
uncomfortable. 
Writing about his personal 
experience in The Michigan 
Gayly was empowering for him 
because he was able to speak 
about the LGBTQ+ community 
in a way he had never been able 
to before. 
“When I first sat down to 
write, I was like, ‘Oh my god,’” 
Beyer said. “It was kind of crazy 
just staring at it. I could just 
actually say what I felt. It was a 
little overwhelming to have that 
unrestricted opportunity, but it 
was really fun.”
Rackham 
student 
Daniel 
Salas-Escabillas, opinion editor 
of the newspaper, wrote an 
article about his experience 
being an ethnic minority as a 
Pacific Islander, while also being 
in the LGBTQ+ community. He 
said he intended the story to 

serve as a resource for others 
who may have a similar story but 
feel alone. 
“It’s 
very 
motivating 
for 
somebody to read (my article) and 
be like, ‘Oh, yeah, I see myself in 
that,’” Salas-Escabillas said. “If 
they want to contact me, that’s 
okay. If not, that’s also okay. Just 
knowing that somebody else has 
gone through what you’ve gone 
through and hopefully giving 
you some motivation to go out 
there and do you, basically.”
Weinstein said these articles 
are 
crucial 
in 
spreading 
awareness among LGBTQ+ allies 
as well. 
“I think that if you’re trying 
to be the best straight ally you 
could be or best cisgender ally 
you could be, knowing those 
things and understanding how 
your words affect people in 
marginalized 
communities 
is 
really 
important,” 
Weinstein 
said. “So if we can educate people 
about that, then maybe we’ll just 
be able to have an impact on how 
people speak and maybe just 
thinking more carefully before 
they talk about LGBT issues in 
front of people.” 
For 
people 
who 
do 
not 
personally 
know 
any 
queer 
or trans people, the LGBTQ+ 
community can seem vague 
or 
abstract, 
Weinstein 
said. 

TMD: One University as 
well as the Climate Action 
Coalition released a joint 
statement calling for carbon 
neutrality 
and 
financial 
equity across the University’s 
three campuses. How do you 
hope they respond to this 
progress report?
MS: Well I have both 
respect 
and 
empathy 
for 
the 
Climate 
Coalition. 
We’re pulling in the same 
direction. I think if there are 
disagreements, 
it’s 
simply 
how fast we can go and what 
we’re willing to say that we 
don’t yet know how to do. 
So one of the main requests 
is to make a commitment 
to be carbon neutral by a 
certain day. And as Jennifer 
just described, we’re still 
defining what carbon neutral 
means, what do we include. 
We just decided to include 
the 
Flint 
and 
Dearborn 
campuses, 
which 
hadn’t 
been the case before. We’ve 
decided to consider scope 
three emissions. In other 
words, things people use and 
commuting because of work 
that the university doesn’t 
own those sources.
TMD: 
Recently 
the 
Semester in Detroit program 
released 
a 
statement 
criticizing the University’s 
participation in the Detroit 
Innovation 
Center. 
They 
compared 
involvement 
to 
colonialism and even accused 
the University’s investment 
of indirectly supporting Dan 
Gilbert in tax evasion. How 
is 
this 
partnership 
with 
Gilbert not an instance of 
private 
interests 
utilizing 
the University at the expense 
of 
the 
general 
public? 
More broadly, how will the 
University 
recognize 
the 
concerns of local residents 
when 
implementing 
the 
center? 
MS: To be honest, I was 
really surprised and a little 
bit 
disappointed 
because 
Semester in Detroit is one of 
many spectacular things we 
do in the city that I’m very 
proud of. The leadership that 
spoke out were expressing 
their own beliefs. They don’t 
speak for the University — 
they speak for themselves, 
which is absolutely fine. The 
Detroit Center for Innovation 
is 
the 
most 
recent 
and 
significant scale thing we’re 
doing in Detroit, but there 
are hundreds of things we’re 
doing in Detroit. 
So we’re functioning at 
many 
different 
levels 
in 
the city doing research and 
teaching, 
which 
is 
what 
we do, but with the goal of 
helping the future prospects 
of the city of Detroit. The 
Center for Innovation is just 
the latest in this series of 
projects. It was brought to us 
as a proposal by the mayor’s 
office and one of our alums 
and donors Steve Ross and 
then joined by Dan Gilbert 
saying ‘Would the University 
be willing to anchor a Center 
for Innovation in Detroit 
if they build it?’ So the 
first thing to clear up, as 
I mentioned earlier, is the 
University is not building 
the buildings. They’re being 
built 
by 
developers 
and 
donors and will be gifted to 
the University. I recognize 
that Dan Gilbert has gotten 
adverse publicity around this 
issue of opportunity zones. 

The zone we’re building in has 
long been identified as a zone 
that needs development and 
qualifies as an opportunity 
zone. It wasn’t the one that 
got caught up in lobbying 
that was referenced in these 
articles about Dan Gilbert 
recently — and we’re not 
providing resources to him. 
What we would do is provide 
the teaching and research 
workforce to help provide 
advanced-level 
education 
that would provide a pipeline 
of employees for businesses 
in 
the 
city, 
particularly 
businesses 
infused 
with 
technology, something we’re 
very good at. 
One 
thing 
we’re 
involved 
in 
now 
is 
working 
collaboratively 
with 
community 
groups, 
particularly 
in 
the 
neighborhoods near this site, 
explaining what we envision, 
hearing their thoughts and 
ideas, discussing ways the 
community 
may 
become 
involved in some of this 
project, whether the facilities 
we 
build 
can 
be 
made 
available to the community 
for all kinds of purposes and 
to do it collaboratively. So 
I’m not quite sure where the 
criticism came from, to be 
honest.
TMD: Given the recent 
student protests in response 
to your comment about peer-
to-peer cross examination, 
some 
have 
said 
the 
University’s policy is skewed 
towards 
individuals 
from 
higher socioeconomic status 
backgrounds because those 
individuals would be able 
to hire lawyers. Would you 
agree? Why or why not? 
MS: This is definitely a 
challenging area. And I’m not 
sure we’re getting it right. 
I’m sure we’re trying to get 
it right, but as directed by 
some court decisions, we do 
have to provide the ability of 
a person who’s been accused 
of misconduct to be able to 
question their accuser in 
some kind of hearing that’s 
been mandated by a court. 
So we follow the law. Then 
the challenge is: How do you 
set up a hearing that is as 
respectful to this individuals 
involved, sensitive to the 
risks of retraumatizing a 
complainant, but yet satisfies 
what the court is demanding 
we do? So one way to do it 
would be to allow advocates 
for 
students 
to 
do 
the 
questioning. Another way to 
do it is to have the students 
themselves do it. 
The 
reason 
that 
we’ve 
decided on an interim basis 
to 
try 
having 
students 
themselves do it is because 
we thought that might be less 
traumatizing 
than 
having 
an 
advocate, 
because 
an 
advocate in some instances 
is likely to be a lawyer, and 
lawyers are really, really 
good at being really, really 
tough on witnesses. And one 
of the reasons many people 
don’t take these complaints 
to the police is they don’t 
want to be up on a witness 
stand and have a lawyer 
representing a respondent go 
through their sexual history 
in a public session. That’s a 
very difficult thing. 
The way we’ve set this up, 
the questioning is occurring 
in real time, but from a 
remote location. And there’s a 
hearing officer that’s a retired 
judge who understands how 
to manage questioning and 
the testimony. And we’ve 

been doing this for almost a 
year. 
Our policies on all student 
disciplinary 
proceedings 
allow you to have an advocate 
with you. And often that 
advocate is mom and dad, 
or a friend or a sibling or 
grandma. But you can bring 
a lawyer. And what we’re 
concerned about is that if 
one person has a lawyer and 
the other person has a family 
member or friend, that may 
not be a fair circumstance. 
So if we do go to a situation 
where advocates are allowed 
to question individuals, we 
would think very seriously 
about 
having 
to 
provide 
lawyers 
for 
everybody. 
But we’d have to hire a lot 
of lawyers and now we’re 
becoming a court taking on 
all those expenses. 
TMD: The University has 
been encouraging students 
to go out and vote through 
initiatives 
like 
the 
Big 
Ten Voting Challenge and 
Turn Up Turnout. U of M’s 
student 
voter 
turnout 
in 
the 2018 midterm elections 
tripled compared to the 2014 
election. 2020’s election is a 
big one, especially with one 
of the presidential debates 
being 
held 
on 
campus. 
What 
accommodations 
is 
the University planning on 
making for student voters 
and will classes be cancelled 
on election day to promote 
everyone to vote?
MS: So we don’t cancel 
classes, we have to add a day 
some other time. And we have 
considered this with several 
of the recent elections such 
as most recently, we worked 
with one of the previous 
CSG 
administrations 
to 
look at this. And we need 
a certain number of class 
days. So although the idea of 
cancelling class, making it 
easier to vote, is a reasonable 
idea, what we would have 
done to do that is taken away 
one of the days of the four-
day weekend, the Fall Break 
weekend. 
And 
it 
turned 
out, 
overwhelmingly, 
that 
students did not want to lose 
a day of fun. And we need the 
same number of each day of 
the week. So, for instance, 
if we give up a Tuesday, we 
need a Tuesday. So it would 
have been quite perfect to 
give up one day of the four-
day weekend and, maybe not 
surprisingly, people weren’t 
interested enough to give up 
a day of vacation to have a day 
to vote.
When you’re in the real 
world and you have a job, or 
you’re a graduate or a medical 
student or something, you’re 
not going to get a day off 
to the year, you will get a 
flexible schedule during that 
day. But the polls are open at 
seven in the morning until 
seven or eight at eight in the 
evening. And during those 
hours, it’s part of your civic 
responsibility to vote. I don’t 
know anybody that’s in class 
from seven in the morning 
to the evening. It is a pain, 
you’re busy. You’re not busier 
than me and I go to vote. You 
may be as busy as me. I don’t 
want to be insulting, but… 
you make the time to vote. So 
I don’t think that’s really an 
excuse for not voting. 
We’ve been putting some 
valid call pressure but we’ve 
been lobbying the state, the 
Secretary of State to figure 
out how to get more voting 
booths, more voting units 
in the Union, which will be 

open again, thank goodness, 
and at the other polling place 
on campus, so that the lines 
move more quickly. 
TMD: Additionally, would 
you consider automatically 
registering students to vote 
when they register as a 
student at the University? 
Why or why not? 
MS: So that’s a really 
interesting idea. I’d have 
to think and talk to others 
about 
that. 
Automatically 
registering 
someone 
to 
vote a condition of being a 
student at a public university. 
That might be a little heavy 
handed. And one of the cool 
things about our democracy 
is you get to choose whether 
to participate. There isn’t 
a law that says you must 
vote. There is a you know, 
constitution that says you 
have the privilege of voting. 
And turning that into a 
requirement by linking it to 
your ability to get educated 
just feels heavy handed to 
me, I’d want to think about it 
more. My goal alternatively is 
to make it as easy as possible 
for people to register and that 
as easy as possible for people 
to vote, but you still have to 
take personal responsibility.
TMD: In 2017, after months 
of 
bargaining 
sessions 
and sit-ins, the Graduate 
Employees’ 
Organization 
and the University reached 
a contract agreement that 
agreed to GEO’s demands for 
pay caps on mental health 
services, the creation of DEI 
Graduate Student Assistant 
Positions 
and 
protections 
for 
international 
graduate 
students. 
However, 
this 
contract 
will 
expire 
this 
coming May. Last Wednesday, 
the GEO’s bargaining team 
began contract negotiations 
with 
the 
University 
for 
their 
upcoming 
contract 
and hosted a rally on the 
Diag 
in 
anticipation 
of 
this process. Some of their 
demands include expanded 
transgender 
healthcare 
coverage, 
opening 
more 
gender 
neutral 
restrooms 
and reducing pay inequality 
between graduate students 
on the University’s three 
campuses. How does the 
University plan to respond to 
GEO’s demands? 
MS: Unions are great. They 
changed the United States, 
they created the middle class, 
they protected all kinds of 
people through our nation’s 
history 
from 
being 
taken 
advantage of. Without a doubt, 
they’re a public good. What 
unions do with employers is 
they negotiate. So demands 
aren’t negotiation — they say 
’you must do this.’ The idea is 
to spend time understanding 
each others’ goals and figuring 
out which ones are the most 
important, since no one ever 
gets everything they want in 
a negotiation, and then you 
sit down and work. And it’s 
hard work. And they’ll meet 
a couple of times a week for 
many months trying to figure 
out what’s a win-win. There 
are some things GEO is going to 
want that they just aren’t going 
to get. There are other things 
they want that are reasonable 
and they will get them. There 
are things the University wants 
and won’t get and vice-versa. So 
couching it as demands before 
negotiations have even started 
to me isn’t a healthy approach. 
Our 
graduate 

“While 
Professor 
Emily 
Lawsin is currently employed 
by the university, our own 
administrators have violated 
her 
lecturers’ 
contract 
in 
attempts to fire her,” UAAO 
wrote 
in 
the 
statement. 
“Professor 
Kurashige 
was 
forced out of his position as 
director of A/PIA Studies and 
has had his job applications 
completely 
disregarded, 
despite 
being 
the 
current 
president of the American 
Studies 
Association. 
The 
University has not presented 
valid reasons for these actions 
against both professors.” 
UAAO 
added 
they 
will 
continue 
to 
fight 
against 
discrimination 
at 
the 
University 
and 
they 
wholeheartedly 
support 
Lawsin and Kurashige. 
“For 
as 
long 
as 
the 
university’s 
administration 
routinely engages in secret 
and illegal acts to undermine 
civil 
rights 
and 
Title 
IX 
investigations, 
UAAO 
will 
continue to fight to change 
this 
system,” 
UAAO 
said. 
“We cannot and will not work 
for the best interests of the 
university if the university 
will not work for the best 
interests of us.”
In 
an 
interview 
earlier 
today, 
University 
President 

Mark 
Schlissel 
told 
The 
Daily the University is taking 
this case to trial instead 
of settling, as it does for 
many discrimination claims, 
because they don’t feel they 
have done anything wrong. 
“The University, when it 
does something wrong, we 
take 
pride 
in 
recognizing 
and rectifying it,” Schlissel 
said. “We settle many, many 
lawsuits when we think that 
the claimant has a reasonable 
claim and we should’ve done 
things differently or better. 
In this instance, the case 
that’s going to trial, we don’t 
think 
that’s 
the 
case. 
So 
we’ll litigate to protect the 
University against claims that 
we just don’t think are fair or 
correct.”
Schlissel said he did not 
feel comfortable commenting 
on the particulars of the case, 
but he said the University will 
follow to whatever the court 
ends up deciding.
“I could sit here and go 
through 
the 
particulars 
because I’ve been briefed on 
things that reach this level, 
but I’d rather not because 
I’m 
afraid 
of 
getting 
it 
wrong,” Schlissel said. “I’m 
not the lawyer representing 
the University. But we only 
litigate things where we think 
the University is being treated 
unfairly. And we’ll see the 
outcome and we’ll certainly 
follow what the court says.”

REPORT

As 
an 
alumni 
of 
the 
University of Detroit Mercy, 
Page said he believes the new 
Innovation building will be the 
catalyst for other universities 
to create other initiatives in 
Detroit.
“Wow, 
look 
at 
what 
Michigan 
is 
doing 
here,” 
Page said. “And the students 
that Michigan attract come 
from all over the world… 
So I think it’s great,” he 
added. “Michigan State has a 
presence and I expect them to 
try to have a bigger presence. I 
wouldn’t be surprised if one of 
the big private schools, maybe 

from around the world, say 
we want to have a presence in 
Detroit now too. Detroit has 
the land and things like that — 
I wouldn’t be surprised if one 
of the Ivy League schools do 
something.”
Page also told The Daily he 
believes more good will come 
out of gentrification than bad.
“When I moved back here, I 
mean, we didn’t have a tax base. 
We didn’t have a functioning 
city government. It was really 
astonishing 
and 
incredible 
to me that this investment 
hadn’t 
taken 
place. 
Now 
you have a tax base, a rising 
tax base, that allows things 
like good bus service, better 
police response, and getting 
roads paved in Detroit,” Page 

said. “All of those things are 
positive. So I look upon: who’s 
the beneficiaries of that? Is it 
the gentrifiers or the people 
that were there? If you look 
at it, the gentrifiers can live 
anywhere. It’s the people that 
really benefit that might not 
have the resources to leave.”
In an interview with The 
Daily on Monday, Schlissel 
clarified that the Center is 
only one of many ways the 
University is involved with 
in Detroit. He also noted the 
University is not involved 
in the construction of the 
center, but rather is providing 
the education and research 
workforce. 
Schlissel told The Daily 
the University is currently 

working with groups in the 
community to receive their 
input and thoughts about the 
project. 
“One thing we’re involved in 
now is working collaboratively 
with 
community 
groups, 
particularly 
in 
the 
neighborhoods near this site, 
explaining what we envision, 
hearing their thoughts and

community 
may 
become 
involved 
in 
some 
of 
this 
project, whether the facilities 
we build can be made available 
to the community for all 
kinds of purposes and to do 
it collaboratively,” Schlissel 
said. “So I’m not quite sure 
where 
the 
criticism 
came 
from, to be honest.”

Save the Huron Street Houses!

I

n 
May 
2019, 
our 
neighborhood — the Old 
Fourth 
Ward 
Historic 
District — found out that three 
houses 
within 
our 
historic 
district would be demolished 
by the University of Michigan 
to make space for a new College 
of Pharmacy. We received a 
three-day notice of the meeting, 
which was held on the Dearborn 
campus, making it difficult for us 
to attend. I wrote the Board of 
Regents instead of attending and 
got no response.
Over the past several years, 
the University of Michigan has 
demolished houses they owned 
in the Old Fourth Ward Historic 
District. We were upset that even 
after the University promised to 
consult with our neighborhood 
group, 
it 
demolished 
these 
houses without warning. Since 
announcing plans to demolish 
the three houses, the University 
has 
responded 
positively 
to 
our request for documentation. 
When historic buildings are 
demolished, they are usually 
documented for posterity so 
that historical styles, methods 
of construction, materials used 
and 
technologies 
employed 
can be noted and passed onto 
future 
generations. 
This 
documentation is of immense 
value to architectural historians.
The houses to be demolished 
form the southern border of the 
Old Fourth Ward Historic District, 
which was established in 1983. 
Historic districts are regulated by 
the city of Ann Arbor’s Historic 
District Commission, but the 
University doesn’t have to abide by 
these rules, being an independent 
body. However, these buildings 
are special for architectural and 
historical reasons. In addition, 
demolition is recognized by many 
as unsustainable behavior due 
to the amount of energy spent 
in both creating the buildings 
and the amount of trash that is 
sent to our landfills as a result of 
demolition. Close to 30 percent 
of landfills are composed of 
plastic and metal. As we say in 
the 
preservation 
community, 
“the greenest building is the one 
already standing.”

The histories of the houses 
are linked with the University’s 
history. The house at the corner 
of Huron and Glen was built 
in 1895 for Josephine Murfin, 
whose son James later became 
a University Regent. Murfin 
Avenue on North Campus is 
named after him. It is a beautiful 
example of the Queen Anne style 
with some unusual features, 
such as the rounded corner 
and the triple windows. This 
combination of features is rare 
in Ann Arbor.

The large limestone building 
at 
1015 
E. 
Huron 
began 
construction in 1905 as the Nu 
Sigma Nu Medical Fraternity. 
Unlike other fraternities that 
moved to Washtenaw, Nu Sigma 
Nu remained at this address 
until 1965. The building is a 
Georgian Colonial style with 
a semicircular limestone bay 
and a crenelated roofline. Stone 
quoins are at every corner, 
making it look like a medieval 
castle.
The 
most 
outstanding 
building is the house at 1007 E. 
Huron. This wooden clapboard 
and shingle house is a rare 
example of the Shingle style 
in Ann Arbor and was built in 
1891. It is characterized by its 
rounded windows, saw-tooth 
shingles and broad expanse of 
roof. It still retains its “porte 
cochere,” under which ladies 
would 
descend 
from 
their 
carriages. It was built by Charles 
Whitman, who later became 
the 
State 
Commissioner 
of 
Railroads. Later, it was used by 
two different fraternities until 
purchased by the University.
Thus, the buildings all have 

historical 
connections 
to 
the University and represent 
unusual 
examples 
of 
late 
19th and early 20th-century 
residential 
architecture. 
Many 
other 
universities 
use buildings like these as 
incubators for smaller units on 
campus. An article published 
on Sept. 4, 2019 in The Daily 
revealed that the University 
was “centered on enhancing 
student life with an emphasis 
on sustainability” and that the 
University wanted to “bring 
the Ann Arbor community and 
the University together.” Two 
excellent ways to start would 
be by respecting our local 
historic districts and keeping 
more refuse out of the landfill.
In 
historic 
preservation, 
sustainable 
preservation 
subscribes to the idea that 
there are tangible ecological 
benefits from reusing already 
constructed 
buildings. 
The 
National Trust for Historic 
Preservation 
notes 
that 

“historic 
preservation 

can — and should — be 
an 
important 
component 
of 
any 
effort 
to 
promote 
sustainable development. The 
conservation and improvement 
of our existing built resources, 
including re-use of historic 
and older buildings, greening 
the existing building stock, 
and reinvestment in older and 
historic communities, is crucial 
to combating climate change.”
The University could also 
set a great example by keeping 
these buildings in place and 
finding another site for the 
College of Pharmacy closer 
to the medical campus. They 
could at least try to find a 
place to move these buildings. 
In addition, it could consult 
with neighborhoods that have 
a stake in the outcome of their 
projects to facilitate better 
town-gown relations. These 
actions could be a first step 
in showing they are sincere in 
their beliefs.

A prequel to 2020
W

ith 
Kentucky 
voting blue in its 
gubernatorial 
election 
and 
Louisiana 
following 
in 
its 
footsteps, 
Republican support seems a 
little shaky. In the months 
leading 
up 
to 
the 
2020 
presidential 
election, 
the 
outcomes of local and state 
races can provide some sort of 
prediction to see which party 
will come out on top. Looking 
at the kind of candidates who 
are winning in the South, 
presidential 
hopefuls 
may 
look 
to 
mimic 
strategies 
used to secure victories in 
Louisiana 
and 
Kentucky. 
However, Democrats should 
be wary of getting complacent 
in the fight for power since 
these 
races 
have 
been 
extremely close. If anything, 
the outcome of these races are 
more telling of the anticipated 
party struggle for dominance, 
especially in key swing states; 
Democrats will need to focus 
their attention on connecting 
with voters and really selling 
their candidates.
The win in Louisiana has 
been pinned on the success 
of voter turnout from African 
Americans, but also the ability 
of Gov. Jon Bel Edwards to 
appeal to a more moderate 
audience. 
Throughout 
the 
race for president, some have 
speculated whether or not 
a more centrist candidate 
like former Vice President 
Joe Biden would be the best 
contender: 
someone 
who 
appeals to Democrats but 
also moderate Republicans. 
On the other hand, more 
liberal 
candidates 
like 
Sen. 
Bernie 
Sanders, 
I-Vt., 
and 
Sen. 
Elizabeth 
Warren, D-Mass., have also 
galvanized large followings 
with their left-wing policies. 
Uniting the people is key for 
any candidate to win in a 
polarized country. Compared 
to 2016, where some voters 
abstained 
because 
they 
disliked both candidates or 

voted for Donald Trump after 
Sanders lost the Democratic 
nomination, candidates today 
need to focus on showing 
strong 
leadership 
and 
drawing in voters. Former 
President Barack Obama also 
threw in his input, calling on 
candidates to stay in touch 
with the voter landscape and 
stick to fixing issues rather 
than revolutionizing them.
Throughout the campaign 
trail, the idea of needing to be 
the candidate to beat Trump 
has been a focal point of what 
the candidates believe appeals 
to the people. However, being 
able to beat Trump stems 
from the ability to convince 
voters that the candidates can 
deliver on their promises and 
improve the quality of life 
across the nation. Given the 

frontrunners are consistently 
Biden, Warren and Sanders 
— one moderate and two far-
left leaning candidates — they 
need to prove that electing one 
of them would be significantly 
better 
than 
another 
four 
years of Trump for everyone. 
Despite 
visiting 
Kentucky 
and Louisiana multiple times 
in the months leading up to 
the elections in both states, 
it is evident that Trump’s 
influence 
lacks 
momentum 
in 
carrying 
Republican 
politicians in their bids for 
election. Democrats were still 
able to win despite Trump’s 
effort to endorse his party’s 
candidates, 
hinting 
at 
a 
potential change in the course 

of Republican power. While 
the president’s influence is 
weakening, Democrats need 
to fight harder than ever to 
keep their progress in red 
states going to secure more 
victories. 
Between the three front 
runners, it is hard to tell 
who will come out on top: 
Biden 
takes 
on 
a 
more 
moderate stance reflective 
of Edwards in Louisiana, 
Warren has a plan to reform 
multiple issues to improve 
the 
lives 
of 
the 
middle 
class and Sanders has the 
recognition and momentum 
from his 2016 campaign. 
Biden holds the front seat in 
most of the polls, but even 
Obama has yet to endorse his 
former vice president. The 
problem with Biden is that 
he has yet to come out with 
a strong cause to champion 
— or maybe that is part of 
his moderate narrative. It 
may be beneficial for him 
to advocate for a specific 
issue to gain more traction 
with voters so they have 
something 
concrete 
to 
associate 
him 
with. 
As 
for Warren and Sanders, 
their 
ambitious 
plans 
to 
completely 
eliminate 
student debt and provide 
Medicare for All sound good 
on paper and resonate with 
the younger demographic, 
but 
may 
fall 
into 
the 
predicament of being too 
revolutionary. 
As 
the 
2020 election approaches, 
candidates 
need 
to 
start 
refining 
their 
campaign 
tactics to appeal to both 
party followers — for the 
primaries — and the general 
public 
for 
the 
general 
election. To avoid a repeat of 
2016, the people need to see 
the emergence of a strong 
leader — one that can unite 
both sides on a platform that 
resonates with the people.

ALICE LIN | COLUMN

Michael Bloomberg – the folly of a billionaire
W

ith the Democratic 
primary 
inching 
closer with every 
passing 
day, 
the 
field 
of 
candidates has been hard-
pressed to slim down from 
the large pool that the race 
started with. The three main 
candidates that have been 
garnering the most attention 
are, of course, Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren 
of 
Massachusetts, 
former Vice President Joe 
Biden 
and 
Sen. 
Bernie 
Sanders of Vermont. Some 
other notable figures in the 
race are Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 
entrepreneur Andrew Yang 
and Sen. Kamala Harris of 
California, 
among 
others. 
I’m sure I don’t have to 
name everyone, as the list is 
quite lengthy. With so many 
candidates fighting for the 
nomination, you’d have to 
either be cocky or foolish (or 
possibly both) to enter now. 
That being said, why the 
hell is Michael Bloomberg 
considering 
running 
for 
president? 
His potential bid for the 
presidency is a departure 
from what he said earlier 
this year. In an opinion 
piece for Bloomberg News, 
Bloomberg 
rhetorically 
asked readers if he should 
“devote the next two years to 
talking about my ideas and 
record, knowing that I might 
never win the Democratic 
nomination,” or if he should 
“spend the next two years 
doubling down on the work 
that I am already leading and 
funding,” concluding that it 
would be more beneficial to 
continue the various projects 
and initiatives he’s already 
running. Why the change of 
heart, Michael?
I don’t really know. But 
what is known is that Jeff 
Bezos, founder and CEO of 
Amazon and the wealthiest 
man in the world, called 
Bloomberg to ask if he’d 
be running for president. 
And if you know anything 
about Bezos, his treatment 
of 
employees 
is 
frankly 
appalling. 
A 
mandatory 
60-hour 
workweek 
at 
grueling 
warehouses, 
negligence 
in 
handling 
workplace injury and slashed 
bonuses after a slight increase 
in wages are all examples of 
Amazon’s horrible treatment 
of 
its 
employees. 
While 
superficially 
indicative 
of 
very little, I’d wager that 
there’s a reason Bezos asked 
Bloomberg 
directly 
about 
his prospects. If we know 
anything from the current 
billionaire in office, it’s that 
he tends to be lenient when 
it comes to income taxes 
and accountability for the 
rich. With income inequality 
reaching five-decade highs 
in the United States, many 
of the candidates on the 
Democratic stage advocate 
for 
wealth 
redistribution. 

Bloomberg, with a history 
of 
favoring 
privatization, 
may win the favor of the 
ultra-rich and elites, but 
is absolutely not what the 
party needs at the moment. 
Speaking 
of 
income 
inequality, 
it 
went 
unaddressed in New York 
City under Bloomberg. As 
New York recovered from 
the 
attacks 
on 
9/11, 
he 
adopted policies that helped 
assist the city in its plight. 
He built and preserved over 
165,000 units of affordable 
housing, 
which 
is 
an 
admirable feat. It all sounds 
fine and dandy until you 
look at the real effects of his 
policies. Median rents rose 
in New York by 19 percent 
in real dollars between 2002 
and 2011, and the homeless 
population in shelters rose 
from less than 30,000 to 
upwards of 50,000. Nearing 
the end of his tenure as mayor 
in 2011, the median income 
for the bottom fifth of New 

Yorkers dropped to $8,844. 
In contrast, the households 
in 
the 
top 
fifth 
earned 
$223,285. The Association 
for Neighborhood & Housing 
Development 
found 
that 
one-third of housing was 
unaffordable 
for 
local 
residents. 
Unsurprisingly, 
this led to an epidemic of 
gentrification 
that 
forced 
many NYC natives out of 
their neighborhoods. Sasha 
Zena, a New York resident, 
said in an interview with 
The New York Times that 
Bloomberg “smothered the 
bohemian creative heartbeat 
of New York City, trading 
it for luxury housing by 
giving 
luxury 
developers 
huge tax incentives.” With 
the concerns of increasing 
inequality 
growing 
ever-
pervasive in the collective 
consciousness, Bloomberg is 
anything but a working-class 
champion. As someone who 
is vying to be an alternative 
to Trump and his policies, 
Bloomberg doesn’t seem all 
too different when it comes 
to caring about the lower 
class. He is absolutely not 
what the Democrats need. 
There 
are 
some 
other 
concerns that I could bring up 
about Bloomberg. He’s been 
noted to be casually sexist 
and objectifying of his female 
employees. Four women have 

filed 
sexual 
harassment 
claims against Bloomberg. 
Crude remarks about him 
wanting 
to 
“do” 
female 
coworkers and various other 
instances of “locker room 
talk” are reminiscent of the 
orange despot he wants to 
dethrone. There’s also his 
support of the infamously 
racist 
“stop-and-frisk” 
policy used by the New 
York 
Police 
Department. 
As 
recently 
as 
January 
this 
year, 
he’s 
gone 
on 
record in favor of the racial 
profiling method of policing 
streets. The practice was 
ruled 
unconstitutional 
in 
2013 in Floyd v. the City 
of New York for violating 
both 
the 
Fourth 
and 
Fourteenth 
Amendments 
(for unreasonable searches 
and racial discrimination, 
respectively). 
Only 
just 
recently has he apologized, 
but it’s a paltry attempt at 
amends. It’s clearly meant to 
try and address the criticisms 
he has garnered before his 
campaign starts in full. He 
is now six years out of office 
and believed in his policy up 
until just months ago. It’s a 
shallow and transparently 
phony apology. For somebody 
who is thought of as a “social 
liberal,” he certainly seems to 
be in conflict with the ideals 
of social justice. Intrinsic 
to social justice is the need 
to fight for marginalized 
groups and their rights, and 
he has shown himself to not 
really care at all. Bloomberg 
can say whatever he wants, 
but actions speak louder than 
words. 
Bloomberg 
is 
obviously 
confident enough in himself 
to run for president and 
represent 
the 
Democratic 
Party. He is so confident that 
he believes he can win despite 
missing 
several 
deadlines 
for 
states 
such 
as 
New 
Hampshire. 
He 
emanates 
a 
sense 
of 
billionaire 
entitlement, 
seeming 
to 
think that somehow, having 
money makes you worthy of 
the Oval Office. However, 
I want to stress that he 
is 
remarkably 
similar 
to 
Donald Trump — much more 
than 
many 
people 
think. 
They’re 
both 
completely 
separated from the American 
populace by virtue of being 
billionaires, raise suspicion 
in their treatment of women 
and actively support policies 
that 
worsen 
the 
already 
enormous gap between the 
rich and the poor. He is a 
rich white billionaire — just 
another plutocrat in it for 
himself. He isn’t the right 
candidate for a party that is 
supposed to represent the 
marginalized 
citizens 
of 
our republic. Don’t let him 
convince you he is.

This past semester I was in English 425, 
an advanced essay writing course focused on 
immersion writing. Throughout the course 
we’ve focused on personal essay writing and 
immersing ourselves into a wider story covering 
a pertinent or engaging topic. For my first 
assignment I wrote a personal investigative 
essay about the life of my father’s mother, Gail 
Grober. 
She was a 5’3” Jewish woman who died at 
age 47 from breast cancer, leaving behind her 
young sons, Bobby and my father Vic. I was 
interested 
in 
writing 
a piece about her and 
investigating 
her 
life 
because 
everyone 
on 
my father’s side of the 
family constantly tells 
me I take after her 
despite the fact that I’ve 
never met her. 
I 
spent 
72 
hours 
writing the now 13-page 
piece, breaking down 
in 
tears 
more 
than 
once as I discovered 
more intimate details 
about the life of this 
elusive 
woman. 
The 
most important thing I 
learned about her was 
from her high school 
yearbook. Beside each 
senior portrait is the 
word “ambition” with a 
colon next to it. All the 
students included their 
post high school ambitions and upon searching 
through the yearbook the vast majority had put 
college, higher education or secretary. But Gail 
is different. Printed next to her “ambition” is the 
word “undecided.” While every other student 
in the yearbook felt so pressured to amount to 
greatness or reach for insane heights or brag 
about a seemingly perfect future ambition, 
Gail was apparently alright with not knowing. 
I fell in love with this ancestor of mine, one that 
nobody speaks of but clearly remembers dearly. 
Thank God for technology and for memory. 
I thought of my maternal grandmother’s 
kitchen the entire time I wrote this essay. I 
thought about how there’s no essay to write 
about her because every single year I come back 
to my grandmother’s home on Christmas day. It 

is warm, she is wearing an apron and slippers. 
There is a lack of words for the sheer joy that 
swells inside this sweet blue home on Jersey 
Avenue. There’s luck in the fortune of knowing 
at least half of where you come from. There’s 
no essay to be written, researching a history 
that’s tangible and breathing and mine because 
I’ve lived it. I have the ability to live it every 
single year. There’s a heart on Jersey Avenue. 
There’s life. And I’m fortunate enough that I 
don’t have to call to say “Dad, Mom: What was 
she like? Tell me a story.” Instead, I can come to 
my grandmother’s house and simply watch her 
cook in the kitchen on Dec. 25th. I can sit down 
for Christmas dinner every year surrounded 
by people who know me and always will. It’s 
tangible. It’s full of life. 
None of us are history. 
Christmas 
time 
is 
nostalgic 
for 
me. 
It 
always has been a time of 
reflection and celebration 
in the midst of joyous 
December. 
Five 
years 
ago, I found out I didn’t 
get into Yale University. 
A few days later on 
Christmas Eve, everyone 
else at my high school 
had heard back from the 
University of Michigan 
and I’d heard nothing. I 
assumed I’d been denied. 
But 
even 
that 
year, 
when I’d assumed I was 
denied from two of my 
top choice schools right 
in accordance with the 
holidays and felt neither 
festive nor celebratory, 
I 
went 
back 
to 
my 
grandmother’s home and felt whole again. It’s 
cyclical — tradition and memory and life — and 
in the unexpected places we find the pieces of 
ourselves we couldn’t find or perhaps didn’t 
know we lost. 
Tradition may be expected or ritual. It is 
something that regularly comes back up each 
year, something that we know and anticipate. 
It is easy to take these types of dinners and 
mornings and festivities for granted, especially 
around the holidays. This year I will not let 
it pass me by: dinner at my grandmother’s, 
the silly game we play in the living room, the 
dancing on tables that takes place early in the 
morning in my kitchen on Christmas day still 
dressed in glitter. It’s important, it’s here, it’s 
not history and for now, it’s mine, it’s ours.

What’s really important
about the holiday season

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

Every scene of “Servant” is gorgeous, highly stylized 
and utterly overindulgent. Set in a historical Philadelphia 
brownstone, M. Night Shyamalan’s newest series 
complements its odd premise and hallmark suspense 
with a flawless aesthetic. 
After the death of their child Jericho, rich couple 
Dorothy (Lauren Ambrose, “Six Feet Under”) and Sean 
Turner (Toby Kebbell, “Fantastic Four”) are unable to 
handle their grief. Rendered nearly catatonic, Dorothy 
begins transitional object therapy and takes care of a doll 
in the place of her son. Tired of enabling her illness, her 
husband confides in her brother Julian (Rupert Grint, 
“Snatch”) about how to prevent Dorothy from being 
further consumed by grief for her son.
Without Sean’s knowledge, Dorothy hires Leanne 
Grayson (Nell Tiger Free, “Game of Thrones”) as the 
Jericho doll’s full-time nanny. 
Much to Sean’s surprise, 
Leanne is entirely unfazed by 
Dorothy’s situation and treats 
Jericho the doll as if it were 
a real child. A shy girl from 
Wisconsin, Leanne struggles 
to adapt to the upper class 
lifestyle of the Turners and 
shocks the parents by praying 
nightly and hanging crosses 
in the baby’s nursery. 
Suspicious of some of Leanne’s odder behavior, Sean 
avoids interacting with her and buries himself in his 
work. One night after Leanne returns from walking 
Jericho through the park, Sean hears a noise on the 
baby monitor, runs to the nursery and finds a real baby 
has replaced the doll. Concerned Leanne or Dorothy 
has stolen this child, Sean and Julian investigate where 
exactly the baby and Leanne came from. 
While the premise of “Servant” is not necessarily 
new in the thriller genre, the series masterfully blends 
some well-used horror tropes with fresh visuals and 

dialogue. The show uses the artifice of luxury to mask 
a deep psychological suffering occurring within the 
family. Leanne, the plain, understated antithesis to 
the Turners’s appearance-based lifestyle, is framed as 
exponentially creepy by simply existing in the wealthy 
space which rejects anything genuine. Sean continually 
refers to her as “staff” and refuses to accept her or her 
odd behaviors.
Like many horror movies, “Servant” addresses gender 
as an aspect of its most disturbing themes. Within 
the Turners’ marriage, though Dorothy may have a 
tenuous grip on reality, Sean is the one tortured by the 
subtle evils in his home. Frustrated with his wife and 
the changes in house, Sean has lost whatever control he 
once had and scrambles to blame Leanne for whatever 
may be happening to him. While what he experiences 
is undoubtedly real, his questioning of his own sanity 
mimics the gaslighting female characters in similar 
thrillers often face. 
In recruiting his brother-in-law Julian, Sean searches 
for any answer that could 
discredit Dorothy and Leanne 
or explain how the doll 
was replaced. As he fails to 
understand what happens to 
him, he slowly becomes more 
violent and lashes out at those 
around him. “Servant” relies 
heavily on an underlying sense 
of increasing claustrophobia, 
as few scenes take place 
outside the strangeness of the 
Turners’ home. Essentially trapped in his home with a 
mysterious nanny and a child he believes may have been 
abducted, Sean cannot escape someone else’s fantasy. 
“Servant” may seem like another attempt at a highly 
stylized Shyamalan comeback, but — plot twist — the 
show actually has some hidden depths worth exploring. 
However trite the concept, some of the show’s most 
shocking moments and cliffhangers are genuinely 
compelling and exciting. Moving forward, “Servant” has 
the potential to truly embrace its aesthetic and plunge 
entirely into its disturbing atmosphere.

‘Servant’ is beauty & brains

When BROCKHAMPTON announced the “Heaven 
Belongs To You” tour with slowthai and then added 100 
gecs as an opener, I couldn’t think of a crazier lineup. 
The SATURATION trilogy was the soundtrack to my 
first two years of college, while Nothing Great About 
Britain and 1000 gecs have been at the top of my music 
rotation since they released in May. On Nov. 30, after 
months of anticipation, the three acts came to the Motor 
City.
My journey leading up to the show was business as 
usual for a Detroit concert. Dump money at the gate of 
an overpriced parking lot, scarred by the number of $45 
tickets I’ve received because I’m incapable of finding 
legal street parking; group up with the gang at Detroit 
One Coney Island on Woodward, the greatest Midtown 
venue pre/post-concert kickback restaurant; debate 
bringing a coat into the venue and stand freezing at 
the back of a long line either way; go to the box office at 
The Masonic to pick up my 
press ticket, and …
General admission — 
lower level.
This had to be a mistake. 
Now, 
I’d 
been 
ripped 
off 
once 
by 
promoters 
at 
The 
Masonic 
when 
I bought tickets to see 
BROCKHAMPTON 
in 
2018, so I was very familiar 
with 
the 
distinction 
between the “lower level” 
and the “pit” — lower level 
meant the outer ring of 
seats, while pit meant the 
actual floor. Now, there’s 
nothing wrong with having 
seats for a concert. But that is not what you want at a 
100 gecs/slowthai/BROCKHAMPTON event, and 
definitely not the perspective you want to read about 
in a concert review. Fortunately, a sincerely wonderful 
friend traded me her pit ticket for my lower level ticket, 
and it’s her act of extreme kindness that saved this 
review from being a purely clinical account.
My pal and I rushed into the theatre to the sight of 
100 gecs’s iconic conifer tree in center stage. Laura 
Les and Dylan Brady were singing “ringtone,” their 
vocals warped and autotuned in their live show just 
like they are in the studio version. Thanks to the pre-
show debacle, I missed “stupid horse” at the beginning 
of their set. This was a grave loss, one which I would 
mourn through the rest of the night and will continue 
to grieve until their next appearance in Detroit. But I 
did hear Laura Les’s blood-curdling growls in the flesh 
during the heavy metal breakdown at the end of “800db 

cloud,” so I could sleep comfortably at night.
Seeing the reaction from the BROCKHAMPTON 
crowd to 100 gecs’s live performance exposed just how 
much of a bubble I live in. In our hyper-art-consuming 
corner of The Daily, myself and many friends adore 100 
gecs — I wouldn’t be surprised if my editors played 100 
gecs at the Arts desk as they published this article. But 
for a mostly young crowd that’s into the highly accessible 
music of BROCKHAMPTON, such an experimental 
opener didn’t go over very well. In our corner of the pit, 
me and my fellow big Gec were jumping up and down, 
belting every lyric, while everyone in our surroundings 
was still as stone. At the very least, though, the duo had 
the audience’s genuine interest. A different opener of 
similar notoriety might have a crowd staring at their 
phones, but everybody at The Masonic was watching the 
onstage spectacle. The crowd did scream in excitement 
during a brief period where Laura Les shredded on 
the guitar, but I think most listeners were just kind of 
confused.
When the lights returned post-gecs, my friend and I 
chatted with a couple that must’ve been in their mid or 
late 20s who were surprised 
to see that they were the 
oldest people in the vicinity. 
I expected a young audience 
— 
BROCKHAMPTON’s 
fanbase is definitely high 
school and college aged — 
but even I was surprised to 
see so many people getting 
dropped off at the venue by 
their parents.
I was in the middle of some 
mid-concert 
networking 
with one of my new mid-20s 
friends (no shame) when 
slowthai 
came 
onstage 
and 
immediately 
jumped 
into his first song. Mildly 
professional conversation was definitely coming out of 
my mouth when slowthai spoke the seven magic words 
— “Kodak moment polaroid picture shake it yeh” — and 
I dropped whatever I was saying to chant them myself.
Since my first concert, I’ve seen dozens of shows and 
dozens of openers, and none of them commanded the 
crowd’s energy the way Tyler, the Creator did at DTE 
during Kid Cudi’s 2013 tour. But slowthai came pretty 
close (and fittingly covered Tyler’s song, “WHAT’S 
GOOD”). The UK rapper had the crowd echoing all his 
adlibs back to him — “yuh” went slowthai, “yuh” went 
the crowd; “brrrt” went slowthai, “brrrt” went the 
crowd. After a murderous performance of “Inglorious,” 
slowthai literally spat into a fan’s mouth. “This is 
fucking punk,” he said. I found it kind of gross, but yeah, 
it was punk.
Afterward he rapped “HEAVEN BELONGS TO 
YOU,” his guest feature on GINGER. The crowd 

seemed absurdly excited for what’s just a chill mid-
album interlude. Then I realized that since it was on 
BROCKHAMPTON’s album, for most of the audience, it 
was probably the only slowthai song they knew. For his 
final song, “Doorman,” he opened the pit, and everyone 
circle-moshed in a frenzy — I somehow ended up near 
the very front of the pit, perfectly positioning myself for 
BROCKHAMPTON. slowthai put on a hell of a show, 
one that added him to the ranks of my favorite live 

performers, right up there with JPEGMAFIA and Vince 
Staples. I just wished his set could have been longer.
BROCKHAMPTON took the stage, the show started 
and it was business as usual for the boys. Dom McLennon 
climbed to the edge of a balcony off-stage to deliver his 
killer verse on “BOY BYE.” Everytime bearface opened 
his mouth, hands with recording phones shot up from 
the audience; I wished I had my own phone ready when 
he did his raspy whisper intro from “I BEEN BORN 
AGAIN.” Merlyn Wood, who already breathes life into 
BROCKHAMPTON in the studio, doubled down on his 
adrenaline-infused delivery for all his verses.
Traditionally, Kevin Abstract and Matt Champion 
have been the meat and potatoes of BROCKHAMPTON, 
especially on the SATURATION trilogy. But I am a firm 
believer that Joba is the heart and soul of GINGER, and 
he proved it that night. Half of my notes on the show 
were just song titles followed by “holy shit Joba.” Among 
those highlight moments were Joba’s gorgeous voice on 
the outro of “BOY BYE,” his stunning verse on “BIG 
BOY” and his terrifying rage on “J’OUVERT.”
Performances from the band were show-stopping 
and jaw-dropping all around — no surprise there — but 
I had mixed feelings about all the other elements of 
the concert. When BROCKHAMPTON first came on, 
slowthai had me full of hype. Then a pattern in the show 

started to emerge, and before long, I almost regretted 
trading my ticket for the pit. After the first few songs, 
the drill became clear: Overuse of the smoke machines 
onstage, and if Kevin wasn’t already telling the crowd to 
open the pit, then the same high-school-senior-looking 
dude in the audience was on the job. Over and over and 
over. It got old by the twelfth time in less than half as 
many songs.
I can’t knock BROCKHAMPTON for their audience. 

It is what it is. But there’s something comforting 
about being able to go to a show, look at all the people 
in line, and think, “I could be good friends with these 
people.” That was not the vibe at BROCKHAMPTON. 
I was mildly perturbed when, during the chorus of 
“1999 WILDFIRE,” Kevin kept yelling “SING IT!” to 
the overwhelmingly white crowd (The chorus drops 
a couple N-words). During “SUGAR,” while bearface 
chanted “Do you love me, love me, love me,” a girl 
behind me — who looked like she came straight out of 
BROCKHAMPTON Stan Twitter — screamed back, “I 
DO LOVE YOU!” on the verge of tears. The band pulled 
several fans onstage during “QUEER,” which was cool 
to see, but their youth cemented that I was too old to be 
there (and I’m literally only 20 years old).
With all those ups and downs, the experience was 
a rollercoaster. The final verdict on the concert is that 
BROCKHAMPTON is worth seeing live once before 
they break up, but once is enough, and watching from the 
lower level seats will do just fine. Every member proved 
that they’re infinitely talented, just not in any way that 
wasn’t already obvious from their studio recordings. 
As for slowthai and 100 gecs, I already immensely 
anticipated their acts, and now I’m even more eager to 
see them again — when they’re the headliners, that is. 
Until then.

CONCERT REVIEW

This year I will not let 
it pass me by: dinner 
at my grandmother’s, 
the silly game we play 
in the living room, the 
dancing on tables that 
takes place early in the 
morning in my kitchen 
on Christmas day still 
dressed in glitter. 

After a murderous 
performance of 
“Inglorious,” slowthai 
literally spat into a 
fan’s mouth. “This is 
fucking punk,” he said.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Martin Scoresese is no stranger to messy, 
twisted characters. He has a tendency to paint 
these characters with a sharp, but humanizing 
brush. This quality is what gives his films like 
“Goodfellas” and “Taxi Driver” (among others) 
their uniquely hazy morality. His stories are 
compelling not despite their darkness, but because 
of it. 
The director’s latest release, “The Irishman” is 
no exception. The film offers both the delectably 
gritty genre work that Scorsese’s audience has 
come to expect as well as a tender self-reflection 
on the filmmaker’s own oeuvre. Following the rise 
of the Buffalino crime family and the Teamsters 
Union, the story depicts the ambitions, flaws and 
humanity of three 
gangsters 
with 
genuine heart.
Frank 
Sheeran, 
played 
by 
Robert 
De Niro (“Heat”), is 
the story’s primary 
narrator, recounting 
his 
experience 
joining 
the 
mafia 
as 
a 
hitman. 
De 
Niro’s performance 
involves some of his most impressive acting in 
years, bringing back the rageful poise of his other 
collaborations with Scorsese along with a softness 
that answers the simple question, what happens to 
a gangster if they make it to old age? That answer 
is not a pleasant one; in fact, when the glory days of 
his role in the mafia are over, it is painful to watch 
him past his prime. A similar point can be made 
about De Niro himself, and maybe that’s what 
makes the film as touching as it is. 
At Sheeran’s side are mob boss Russel Buffalino 
(Joe Pesci, “My Cousin Vinny”) and President of 
the Teamsters Union Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino, 
“Ocean’s Thirteen”). The very experience of 

watching these three legendary actors interact 
is electrifying — their criminal endeavors made 
me momentarily feel what it was like to watch 
the crime movies with fresh eyes. But to call “The 
Irishman” a mere best hits anthology of Scorsese’s 
career would be a severe underappreciation of its 
power. 
Sheeran, Buffalino and Hoffa’s stories are laden 
with stylistic and narrative Scorsese tropes, but 
they explore new territory too. In particular, I 
found the script’s entanglement with national 
politics particularly insightful. The Buffalino 
family’s friendship with the Kennedys sheds light 
on a magnitude of political corruption that is 
present in other crime movies, but rarely so directly 
impactful on actual history. 
Scorsese leaves no detail of this story out, 
amounting in a runtime of three hours and 29 
minutes. Yet, the film does not drag for the most 
part. 
Excepting 
the 
penultimate 
hour, a close look 
at 
Jimmy 
Hoffa’s 
attempts to return 
to 
power, 
“The 
Irishman” 
avoids 
feeling sluggish. If 
anything, I’m glad 
Scorsese decided to 
pack the story with 
everything he could.
But Scorsese knows that the actors at the 
film’s center now lack the vitality of their 
digitally de-aged counterparts possessed in the 
mob’s heyday. And he uses this to his advantage, 
challenging the audience to imagine their lives 
without youth or momentum or glory. In this 
way, “The Irishman” becomes a story about 
falling from one’s peak. The nature of a high 
point is that it is momentary, subject to the 
remorseless advance of time. What Scorsese 
ultimately achieves with “The Irishman” is 
nearly magical: It is a sad, even painful thing 
to watch these criminals fade, much like it is to 
watch Scorsese himself grow old.

‘Irishman’ is a moving trip

 BOOK REVIEW

Even if you don’t know her name, it’s likely 
you’ve seen Debbie Harry’s face. As the 
frontwoman of the groundbreaking sometimes-
pop, sometimes-rock group Blondie, Harry’s 
wide-set eyes and shock of bleach-blonde hair are 
unmistakable, a necessary and irreplaceable part 
of 
music 
history. 
Blondie 
was 
the 
band, but it was 
also 
a 
character 
for Harry to play, 
an 
ultra-feminine 
woman in the macho 
rock scene of New 
York in the ’70s, 
consistently proving 
her 
place 
in 
the 
industry over and 
over again. In her own words, Harry’s “Blondie 
character was an inflatable doll but with a dark, 
provocative, aggressive side.”
Her image was appropriated by friend, Andy 
Warhol, in his iconic Polaroid series, in his 
eerie computer-generated pop art, in addition 
to photographs which have been taken of her by 
every major photographer. Harry is an icon in 
the truest sense of the word — just as Marilyn 
Monroe’s blonde curls represent a specific time 
and place in the past, so do Harry’s, heralding 
onlookers into a people’s 
history of art and rebellion 
in the greatest city on the 
planet. 
“Coincidence 
came 
calling for me big-time 
in the early seventies,” 
Harry writes in an early 
chapter of the memoir. 
“Coincidence: it’s supposed 
to 
mean 
just 
these 
random 
disconnected 
events 
that 
concur 
or 
collide. But coincidence 
is not that at all. It’s the 
stuff that’s meant to be.” 
This 
perception 
makes 
sense 
considering 
the 
performer’s 
history. 
Everything 
that 
made 
Debbie Harry the icon 
she is today is what made 
Blondie so popular, and 
most of what happened 
in the height of post-punk 
glory 
seems 
to 
hinge 
on brief moments of interpolation between 
one world and the next. In the book, Harry 
remembers these flashes of coincidence in 
brilliant literary detail, plunging the reader into 
the color and fury of her experiences with a sharp 

wit and unflinching sense of honesty. 
From the first page, in which Harry describes 
her biological parents before going into the stories 
of her childhood as an adopted daughter of two 
humdrum New Jerseyans, one is able to grasp 
how she’s processed the somewhat accidental 
nature of her life. The musician has a keen eye for 
detail and orchestration: Just when she brings up 
an anecdote that seems out of place, it suddenly 
begins to make sense in the larger framework 
of her life — the last 
chapter of the book 
is all about thumbs in 
her life, just because 
she wanted to end 
on a funny note. 
Harry’s own sense 
of humor about both 
the 
happy 
times 
and the sad times 
of her rollercoaster 
experience 
with 
fame is what makes “Face It” a must-read. Sure, 
two of her apartments went up in flames, one 
of them while she was on tour, but it made for 
a fantastic photoshoot in which she sat in burnt 
kitchen wearing a full ballgown. 
Harry’s clout as a cultural powerhouse could 
have carried her through “Face It” on a wave of 
crazy stories about shows, cheeky cameos from 
her bandmates and thin analyses of her own life. 
But Harry doesn’t do this at all. Instead, “Face 
It” seems more like a self-interrogating revision 
of 
her 
experiences, 
occasionally 
punctuated 
by the names and stories 
that we expect from a rock 
star’s memoir.
From 
someone 
who 
has 
been 
funneling 
her 
experiences 
and 
inspirations into music 
and art for the last 40 
years, it is clear how 
easily 
self-analysis 
comes to Harry, as she 
weaves her true history 
into a riveting and often 
surprising 
narrative 
of 
serendipity and triumph. 
Even if you’ve never heard 
a Blondie song beyond 
“Heart of Glass” (on Wii 
Just Dance 2), Harry’s 
story is one that deserves 
to be read widely. Her 
voice and experiences act 
as a time capsule of New 
York in its prime. The 
American reflex to make art, even in the craziest 
of times, is most present in people like her. That 
thread of passion is hard to miss in Harry’s 
retelling of her own story, as it is one that reaches 
much farther than just her.

Debbie Harry’s ‘Face It’ is
more than a popstar story

Michigan learning how to bend but not break

Kris Mayotte’s favorite saying 
is ‘Bend, but don’t break.’ It’s 
been parroted around the halls 
of Yost Ice Arena enough times 
this season that every time 
someone says something to that 
effect, everyone knows where it 
came from.
But the Michigan hockey 
team has largely struggled to 
fulfill what its assistant coach 
has been asking. In three of 
the Wolverines’ seven Big Ten 
games before Sunday’s game in 
Madison, Michigan held a two-
goal lead in the second period — 
four times if you count both the 
2-0 and 3-1 leads over Michigan 
State on Nov. 14.
All three times, the Wolverines 
broke under pressure as their 
opponents came back to win.
In the conference opener at 
Ohio State on Nov. 1, redshirt 
sophomore 
forward 
Emil 
Öhrwall found the back of 
the net for his first goal in a 
Michigan 
sweater 
halfway 
through the second period. The 
Wolverines led, 2-0, and had all 
the momentum.
Six 
minutes 
later, 
the 
Buckeyes halved the deficit, and 
Michigan couldn’t get its feet 
back. Just over a minute into the 
third, Ohio State found twine 

again. And not even two minutes 
after that, the Buckeyes took a 
lead they wouldn’t relinquish.
The Wolverines bent, and 
then they broke.
Two weekends later against 
Michigan State, the breaking 
point was even more damning. 
Sophomore forward Garrett Van 
Wyhe had just given Michigan 
a 2-0 lead when the Spartans 
marched down the ice on the 
next shift and made it a 2-1 game. 
But the Wolverines bounced 
back — for the time being — 
when freshman forward Johnny 
Beecher fired a sharp-angle shot 
over goaltender John Lethemon’s 
shoulder and Michigan regained 
a two-goal lead.
As you either know or can 
guess by now, that two-goal lead 
was doomed. Michigan State 
made it 3-2 by the end of the 
second period and 3-3 just under 
four minutes into the third. By 
the 8:51 mark of the third period, 
the Spartans had taken the lead.
Once again, the Wolverines 
bent. Then they broke.
“There’s times where were 
just get too high or get too low 
and then you can see that in 
the 
game,” 
said 
sophomore 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg 
after that game. “Or some shifts 
don’t go our way, and you can 
kinda see that happen. (Mayotte) 
says, ‘Bend, don’t break,’ and I 

think we gotta keep working on 
that.”
It felt as though blowing a 
two-goal lead — twice — on 
home ice to its biggest rival 
would either be a turning point 
or a breaking point for Michigan. 
The game two nights later in 
East Lansing seemed to prove 
it was a breaking point, as the 
Wolverines were shut out for the 
first time all year in a 3-0 loss.
It was the Spartans’ first 
sweep over Michigan since 2009.
And when the Wolverines 
returned to conference play this 
past weekend at Wisconsin, the 
same story returned. Michigan 
got out to an early lead and led 
2-0 in the second period.
In a blink, it was 2-1 after 
forward Dylan Holloway beat 
sophomore goaltender Strauss 
Mann when the Wolverines got 
caught in a slow line change. 
Minutes 
later, 
defenseman 
Wyatt Kalynuk made it 2-2 
when he danced through all five 
Michigan skaters on his way to 
the net.
Inevitably, the Badgers took 
the lead just over halfway 
through the third period when 
defenseman K’Andre Miller’s 
shot 
bounced 
off 
freshman 
defenseman Keaton Pehrson’s 
skate and into the net.
For the third time in four 
weeks, the Wolverines blew a 

2-0 lead and lost. The loss was 
characterized by mental lapses, 
of a team that just couldn’t find 
a way to win. A team that had 
long since passed its bending 
point and was now, truly, at its 
breaking point.
“But we have to find a way, we 
have to stick together and work 
through this time that we’re 
having,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson on Sunday. “Then 
once we find a way to win some 
games, we’re going to win our 
share of one-goal games. We just 
have to stick together as a group 
and continue to work. It’s the 
only way we’re going to get out 
of it.”
So, when Michigan found 
itself up 2-0 early in the second 
period 
in 
Sunday’s 
game, 
there 
was 
little 
reason 
to 
expect the script to be flipped. 
When freshman forward Nick 
Granowicz went to the box for 
roughing in the third period and 
Wisconsin’s Cole Caufield made 
it a 2-1 game with six minutes 
left, it looked to be, once again, 
the same story, different night.
But for the first time in 
Big Ten play, the Wolverines 
didn’t break. An empty-netter 
from 
senior 
forward 
Jake 
Slaker sealed things with 46 
seconds left for Michigan’s first 
conference win. 
“They’ve had some tough 
losses,” Pearson said Sunday. 
“And every time you lose like 
that it’s like somebody reaches 
in and rips a piece of your heart 
out, but they’ve continued to 
come and believe and work and 
so from that standpoint, it’s a 
huge win.”
Three times, the Wolverines 
broke. On the fourth, they bent 
— just a bit — and then managed, 
somehow, to hold strong. 
It’s way too soon to make 
determinations about whether 
this win is a turning point 
for 
Michigan, 
because 
the 
Wolverines 
may 
well 
find 
themselves at another breaking 
point this weekend when first-
place Penn State comes to town.
But for the first time, Michigan 
managed to do what Mayotte has 
been begging for all year.
Bend, but don’t break.

‘M’ season ends in disappointing 
fashion with Sweet Sixteen loss

It all seemed too good to be true. 
Derick Broche found himself all 
alone, green grass the only thing 
between him and the opposing 
goalkeeper, his feet the recipient 
of a ball that split the Wake Forest 
defense. One accurate touch and 
the sophomore forward would tie 
up the game. 
The equalizer, though, wasn’t 
meant 
to 
be. 
Broche’s 
shot, 
seemingly destined for the net, 
trickled harmlessly past the post, 
wide right. 
Broche’s gaffe, arguably the 
most egregious error in a game rife 
with missed opportunities, was 
microcosmic of Sunday’s 3-1 Sweet 
Sixteen loss for the Michigan men’s 
soccer team (11-5-6) against Wake 
Forest (15-4-2). As the missed 
chances built, Michigan’s chances 
at winning the game dwindled 
away. 
“It was just a hard fought match 
and, in the end, it was a game of 
chances converted,” said Michigan 
coach Chaka Daley. “They found 
their chances, and we missed 
ours.”
In the 70th minute, just moments 
after the Wolverines missed their 
golden opportunity, the Demon 
Deacons capitalized upon one of 
Michigan’s defensive mistakes. 
Senior defenseman Abdou Samake 
was whistled for a foul going for a 

loose ball in the box, which led to 
a Bruno Lapa penalty kick goal. 
Lapa’s strike buried the Wolverines 
in a two-goal deficit, capping off a 
sequence that served as the nail in 
the coffin to Michigan’s season. 
“Momentum 
swings, 
that’s 
football,” Daley said. “When the 
momentum swings, you know 
we’re one-on-one twice in the 
game, goals change games for 
sure. And that sequence certainly 
changes the game in the end.”
In the 24th minute, graduate 
transfer forward Nebojsa Popovic 
missed a chance that began equally 
as promising as Broche’s. Popovic 
received a through ball from senior 
winger Jack Hallahan that led him 
behind the last row of defense, yet 
his one-timer was deflected out 
of bounds on a lunging save by 
Wake Forest goalkeeper Andrew 
Pannenberg. 
Throughout, 
the 
Michigan 
attack continued to create chances 
with six shots on goal, growing 
into its own as the game went on. 
Failing to convert on said chances, 
though, plagued most of the 
opportunities. 
Scoring became an even more 
challenging task for the Wolverines 
when Hallahan — the team’s 
third-leading goal-scorer — left 
the game in the 53rd minute due 
to an apparent injury after being 
inadvertently struck in the face. 
Michigan’s defense, meanwhile, 
was 
in 
bend-but-not-break 

mode from the opening whistle, 
struggling to keep one of the 
nation’s most potent attacks at bay. 
In the first half, the defense held 
its own. In the second half, it finally 
broke. 
The Wolverines deployed an 
aggressive press, which left them 
vulnerable to counter attacks 
and long passes down the wing. 
Five minutes into the second half, 
Wake Forest forward Machop 
Chol burst by junior defenseman 
Austin Sweich on the right flank 
and launched a cross towards the 
box. Freshman goalkeeper Owen 
Finnerty dove off his line, yet 
the ball came inches away from 
grazing his outstretched right 
hand. Instead, it found the head 
of Demon Deacon forward Kyle 
Holcomb, who wasted no time in 
giving Wake Forest the 1-0 lead. 
“Defensively, 
we 
pressed 
them pretty well, kept them 
uncomfortable for a large portion 
of the game,” Daley said. “We 
were pretty good until we made 
those mistakes in the second half, 
and they were really sharp on 
capitalizing on our mistakes. That 
was the difference in the game.”
Michigan finally broke through 
in the 77th minute when junior 
midfielder Marc Ybarra rifled a 
kick from outside the box, and the 
ball pinballed through the defense 
until it found Broche’s right foot 
and the back of the net. 
The Wolverines’ stay on life-
support, though, proved short-
lived. In the 83rd minute, Holcomb 
struck again, blasting a one-timer 
off a right-side cross over Finnerty 
directly at the net and notching his 
second goal of the game. 
The plug had officially been 
pulled on the Michigan’s season. 
“It’s a sad locker room,” Daley 
said. “Never easy to end your 
season. But at least we ended 
our season to a very formidable 
opponent. We want to compete 
against the big boys of college 
soccer and that’s what we came to 
do and the boys were up for it. Just 
disappointed in the end.”

For seniors, a familiar season’s end

Shea Patterson has only been 
at Michigan for two years, but 
that didn’t seem to matter.
The question — What went 
wrong in the third quarter — 
lingered in the air for eight 
seconds, 
then 
nine, 
before 
Patterson muttered his response.
“I don’t have anything for 
that,” he said, his voice cracking 
as he shook his head. As Patterson 
held back tears, it was hard to 
feel anything but sympathy. He 
grew up in the epicenter of this 
rivalry, a Michigan fan from 
birth. 
When 
he 
transferred 
two years ago, it was with the 
promise that he could be the one 
to lead the Wolverines past Ohio 
State — something they hadn’t 
done in six tries up to that point.
Now, that streak is at eight, 
with 
Patterson’s 
two 
shots 
at 
the 
Buckeyes 
ending 
in 
blowout 
losses. 
Michigan’s 
traditional seniors at least had 
victory within their grasp as 
freshmen and sophomores, but 
they too leave winless. Only a 
meaningless bowl game now 
separates them from the end of 
their college careers.
“It’s very, very frustrating,” 
Patterson said, sitting beside 
sophomore 
running 
back 
Hassan Haskins at the podium 
postgame. “What we do all year 
leading to this game is for them. 
We know it’s an emotional game. 
Luckily Hassan’s got a few more 
shots at them.”
Implicit in his comments is 
that Patterson and the rest of 
Michigan’s seniors don’t.
That doesn’t, in and of itself, 
make their college careers a 
waste. Patterson has 19 wins in 
his two years here. The four-year 
seniors have 37. Those, like fifth-
year senior Jordan Glasgow, who 
have been here for Harbaugh’s 
entire tenure have 47.
“I don’t think this result 
should have been the result that 
we should have seen,” Glasgow 
said. “But it’s the one that we 

have. We just gotta live with 
that.”
On 
Saturday 
afternoon, 
though, living with that was 
easier said than done.
All week, these same seniors 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of this game. The national 
championship and Big Ten title 
hopes that they arrived with four 
years ago were gone, but beating 
Ohio State — just once — could 
cure all.
“I just love playing in these 
big games,” senior guard Ben 
Bredeson said Monday. “There’s 
no bigger stage in college football 
than 
Ohio 
State-Michigan. 
That’s why we all come to the 
respective schools is to play 
championship football and with 
that, play each other, be a part 
of the greatest rivalry in college 
football.”
A week later, that opportunity 
has 
been 
evaporated 
into 
history, 
joining 
relinquished 
championship 
hopes 
in 
Michigan’s latest lost season.

It’s 
a 
feeling 
that 
five 
generations of seniors have now 
had to put into words. For five 
years, they’ve taken to a podium 
— whether in Ann Arbor or 

Columbus — and been asked how 
it feels to leave Michigan without 
a win over their biggest rival. 
And for five years, there hasn’t 
been anything new to say.
“Wish I could’ve got a couple 
wins in it,” safety Tyree Kinnel 
said after last year’s 62-39 loss. 
“That’s the toughest part. I’m 
gonna have to sleep on that the 
rest of my life, that I was not able 
to win in this game.”
A year earlier, John O’Korn 
fought through tears to deliver 
the same message.
“The hardest part for me is 
that you come here to win this 
game,” O’Korn said then. “And 
our senior class wasn’t able to do 
it.”
Now, it comes from Patterson 
and Glasgow and Bredeson. All 
took different paths to get here, 
but all entered Saturday with 
one chance to etch their names 
in Michigan history.
Instead, they leave with an 
eight-game losing streak in their 
wake.
“Definitely really frustrating, 
especially for the seniors,” said 
senior tight end Sean McKeon. 
“It’s just kind of the same thing 
every year.”

How a full-court press 
unleashed an offense

So 
far 
this 
season, 
the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team’s 
greatest 
advantages 
over its mid-major opposition 
have been its size, speed and 
strength.
Every player in its starting 
lineup is over six feet — a rarity 
in women’s basketball. With 
three starting forwards, it looks 
to dominate the paint every 
game.
And the Wolverines succeed, 
when they find space and 
hold onto the ball. Sophomore 
forward Naz Hillmon is the 
team’s leading scorer, followed 
by 
freshman 
center 
Izabel 
Varejão and senior forward 
Kayla Robbins. Their length is 
their strength — 58 percent of 
points come from shots inside 
the arc.
Against Eastern Michigan 
on Nov. 27, though, Michigan 
struggled early on producing 
offense. Missed shots, missed 
free 
throws 
and 
turnovers 
plagued the team in the first 
quarter.
And 
then 
on 
Sunday, 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico changed the game plan 
completely. The entire team 
played in the first quarter, as the 
Wolverines struggled to take 
a lead against Morgan State. 
Barnes Arico decided to press 
the Bears.
“We’re trying to figure out 
with our rotations and what’s 
the best lineup to be able to 
(press),” Barnes Arico said. “It’s 
hard if you’re playing (Hillmon) 
37 minutes a game to be pressing 
the entire time, but tonight with 
an opportunity to use our 11 
players, we were able to press a 
little bit more, which is great.”
The shift started early in 
the first half, when sophomore 
guard Danielle Rauch came on 
the court for sophomore guard 
Amy Dilk. There would be no 
break from the onslaught of 
pressure for the visitors. After a 
tight first half, the Bears finally 

broke — turning the ball over 
seven times and giving Michigan 
13 points off turnovers.
“We were able to get into the 
open court in transition so it 
was higher percentage shots,” 
Barnes Arico said. “In the first 
half we were taking sometimes 
contested (shots) and turning 
the ball over a lot, so I think our 
defense helped us create our 
offense which helped us settle 
in a little bit more.”
Added senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson: “When we don’t get 
stops on defense it kind of 
messes up our offense because 
we lose our confidence, things 
like that. But our ability to get 
stops, get steals, get rebounds, 
things like that, we really pride 
ourselves on that.”
When Morgan State finally 
crumbled under the Wolverines’ 
press, the floodgates opened for 
Michigan’s offense. Shooters 
like freshman guard Michelle 
Sidor enjoyed an abundance 
of time and space to get shots 
off, Sidor sank four 3-pointers 
on her way to a career high 16 
points. As a whole, the team 
shot 61 percent in the second 
half, compared to 47 percent in 
the first.
Thanks to the press, the 
Wolverines had found their 
rhythm.
“In the first half we kind of 
tried to do one pass and shot a 
lot of the times,” Johnson said. 
“But in the second half we 
calmed down and got the two, 
three, four passes and then 
the duck in or the kick out to 
the three. So I think it was a 
lot more of rhythm and then 
confidence.”
In the second half against 
Morgan State, Michigan put 
a lid on its turnovers — its 
biggest early-season problem — 
committing just three.
For the first time all season, 
the Wolverines seemed to use 
their dominant athleticism in 
another way beyond controlling 
the glass, freeing up their 
guards to steal the spotlight in 
a way they haven’t all season.

F

or the Michigan men’s 
basketball team, Juwan 
Howard’s undefeated start 
is a pipe dream-turned-reality.
Just seven games into his 
tenure, the 
first-year 
coach has 
already 
scored a 
pair of top-
10 wins. In 
doing so, he 
slayed two 
coaching 
juggernauts 
in North 
Carolina’s 
Roy Williams and Gonzaga’s 
Mark Few — both of whom 
rank top-10 in all-time winning 
percentage — en route to 
claiming last week’s Battle 4 
Atlantis.
When Howard was first 
introduced, it appeared he’d be 
inheriting a shell of last season’s 
Sweet 16 team. The Wolverines’ 
three leading scorers jumped 
to the NBA, while the coach 
who built the program into a 
perennial contender followed 
suit soon after.
With only one recruit set 
to join the program following 
the decommitment of four-star 
forward Jalen Wilson, it seemed 
as though Howard’s first season 
could be discounted given 
the surrounding uncertainty. 
Instead, he retained four-star 
guard Cole Bajema’s pledge and 
lured Franz Wagner away from 
Alba Berlin of the EuroLeague.
For a program that was 
widely expected to take a short-
term step backward under 
Howard, early returns have 
produced the opposite. And now, 
six months after losing Jordan 
Poole, Ignas Brazdeikis, Charles 
Matthews and John Beilein, 
Michigan is ranked No. 4 in the 
nation after a record-tying leap 
from unranked territory.
It’s not a fluke — rather, it’s 
a product of Howard’s hiring 

and the culture he’s already 
established.
“First and foremost, (Howard 
is) just telling us it’s a player-led 
team and allowing us and giving 
us responsibility,” sophomore 
guard David DeJulius said after 
beating the Tar Heels. “When 
you get that responsibility, you 
take ownership of your own 
team. Other than that, he does a 
great job of having open, candid 
conversations with us on and off 
the floor.
“When you have a coach 
that you know cares about you 
genuinely, both on and off the 
floor, then you’ll run through a 
brick wall for him.”
This type of immediate 
success isn’t run of the mill, 
even in the highest-profile 
coaching gigs. By now, Howard 
has made it tough to believe 
he’s only a month removed 
from his first game at the 
helm, in which the Wolverines 
came dangerously close to 
squandering a 30-point lead 
against an Appalachian State 
team that finished 11-21 last 
season. 
In each game since, Michigan 
has taken a step forward. An 
eye-opening one, at that. It’s 
a credit to Howard’s culture, 
which the nation noticed for the 
first time in the Bahamas.
“(There’s an) open-door 
policy,” junior guard Eli Brooks 
said after Michigan’s win over 
North Carolina. “Anytime you 
need (Howard), he’s there. He’ll 
let you know that, too. You can 
really feel it. Some people say 
it’s not real, but with him, it’s 
real.”
For Howard, such a culture is 
representative of his coaching 
style. By putting the power 
in the players’ hands during 
games, his preachings become 
more than just words.
“Coming out of half, usually, 
most coaches you may know 
want to adjust and control the 
game as much as possible,” 

junior forward Isaiah Livers 
said in Atlantis. “But we’re 
lucky enough to have a coaching 
staff where they let us dictate 
our own coming out in the 
second half, and then we rely 
on (Howard’s) words. He’s more 
of a players’ coach where he 
understands the game. You can’t 
play the game if you’re being 
controlled the whole time.”
From a technical standpoint, 
Howard has been equally 
effective in the same capacities 
that made him a well-regarded 
NBA assistant coach. During 
his six-year stint on the Miami 
Heat’s staff, he was responsible 
for the ascension of centers 
Hassan Whiteside and Bam 

Adebayo.
Senior center Jon Teske 
is the perfect case study of 
Howard’s early impact in Ann 
Arbor. After posting 9.5 points 
and 7.0 rebounds across 27.9 
minutes per game last season, 
he’s averaging 13.3 points and 
9.7 rebounds on a career-best 
56-percent clip from the field 
across fewer minutes per game 
(27.4) so far this year.
Howard’s impact on Teske 
was most apparent against 
the Tar Heels and Bulldogs, in 
particular, as the 7-foot-1 center 
tallied a combined 29 points 
and 23 rebounds en route to 
tournament MVP honors.
“Since the first day, (Howard) 

has been teaching me, showing 
me tips,” Teske said. “He’s got 
a lot of knowledge of the game, 
so just asking him questions 
and he’s more than willing to 
help me, and it’s showed the last 
couple of games.”
At this point, Howard appears 
to be well on his way to crafting 
the perfect marriage of culture 
and fundamentals.
Granted, most of this group 
was part of last season’s team, 
which climbed as high as No. 2 
in the national poll following a 
program-best 17-0 start. After 
mid-January, though, Michigan 
lost seven of its final 20 games.
To first-year associate head 
coach Phil Martelli, who 

spent the last 34 years at St. 
Joseph’s, the attention around 
Howard’s immediate success is 
anything but an overreaction. In 
Howard, he sees someone with 
everything needed to reach the 
pinnacle of coaching.
“I’m here to help Juwan 
Howard coach on a Monday 
night in April,” Martelli said in 
October. “ … Because he’s going 
to do that.”
A month into Howard’s 
tenure, that proclamation is 
starting to sound a whole lot 
more plausible.
