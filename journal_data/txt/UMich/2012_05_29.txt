Six people with vastly different
lives, backgrounds and reasons
found their wayto Michigan. They
came to write a new chapter, dis-
cover their purpose and recapture
their love for the game.
Six paths merged into a single
direction that led them to the
heart of Ann Arbor.
As the seniors stepped off the
field at Ray Fisher Stadium for the
last time, their footprints sank
into the crimson dirt, deepening
their mark on tradition.
Though the impressions have
since disappeared, raked over and
smoothed into the ground, small
traces of the rust-colored dust
stuck to the bottom of their cleats
and will follow them wherever
their next journey lies.
Their stories were unwritten
and untold until now.
The Apple Doesn't Fall Far:
A young John Lorenz slipped his
hand into a glove.
As soon as he could walk, John
was in the backyard of his home
on Chicago's South Side, learning
the basics that would carry him

games in the street and a nearby
empty lot.
But John always saved enough
energy for when his father, Joe,
would come home from work.

for Lewis University, he spent
the next four years in the minor
leagues at third base - the posi-
tion he would one day pass down
to his son.
After Joe's stint in professional
baseball with the San Francisco
Giants and Atlanta Braves, he
started taking his young son to
high-school games and Lewis
alumni games - where John got
his first taste of competition, and
that sparked a hunger that has yet
to be satisfied.
John was in second grade and
the sun was just peeking out of the
early morning darkness. He woke
up early to get ready for school -
his mother, Erin, was impressed.
But she soon realized there was
an ulterior motive as her son sat
in front of the television, mes-
merized by last night's double
plays and home runs on ESPN's
"SportsCenter."
During elementary school and
beyond, teachers would ask him,
"What do you want to be when you
grow up?"
John never hesitated to answer,
"A baseball player."
John's grandmother - a die-

tree.
With baseball at the forefront,
John added basketball and vol-
leyball to his already hectic sched-
ule. On the weekends, he would
rush from one game to the next,
switching uniforms in the car,
barely making it in time for tip off
or the first pitch.
Erin, who played collegiate
volleyball and is the director of
Ultimate Volleyball Club, and Joe
were happy to share their passions
with their son, but they never
pushed him - John was competi-
tive by his own nature.
At 14 years old, John made it to
the Junior Olympics for volleyball,
but his team fell short. Upset as he
passed the bracket boards, John
looked over the USA Volleyball
All-American list. With determi-
nation in his eyes, he turned to his
mother and said, "I want to be on
that list."
One year later, he made it, and
he took his team to the champion-
ships.
But as the level of competition
rose, John had a decision to make.
In the back of his mind, he always
knew his heart was in baseball.

John knew the rule.
"You can't commit on the spot
- we need to go home and discuss
it as a family."
After months of recruiting let-
ters, scholarship offers and visits
to different universities, John was
faced with another decision that
would define his future.
As soon as he stepped onto the
Ray Fisher field, he imagined him-
self playing on that very grass. He
felt at home.
During the tour of the facilities,
John's certainty only grew stron-
ger. Then-head coach Rich Malo-
ney escorted the Lorenz family
into the Stephen M. Ross Academ-
ic Center, where he turned off the
lights in the theater.
A feature of Michigan history
played before them, ending with
footage of the team that won three
straight Big Ten titles. This was
the legacy of which John so des-
perately wanted to be a part.
He leaned over to his mother in
the dark and mouthed the words,
"I'm committing right now." But
he knew the rule.
Walking through the rest of
the Academic Center, three mem-
bers of the reigning championship
team - Chris Berset, Kevin Cislo
and Ryan LaMarre - coinciden-
tally crossed their path. That's
when Erin, too, was sold.
"Oh my gosh, these guys are
what I want my son to be," Erin
thought to herself. "It made a huge
impression on me as a mother
with my 17-year-old kid, trying to
project what he's going to be like
when he's 22."
So on the five-hour drive back
to Frankfort, Ill., Erin and Joe lis-
tened to their son in the back seat
plead his case, repeating with con-
fidence, "This is it. This is the one
for me."
Almost immediately, John can-
celed his pending visits and called
Maloney to accept - to become a
Wolverine.
Shortly after, he received a card
from his new coach that he dis-
played on the refrigerator, remind-
ing him every day to "always do a
little extra ... work hard and then
some."

House passes law

NHL Classic
By STEVE ZOSKI
Daily News Editor
A day where beer taps flow
freely inside the Big House got
one step closer to being a reality
last week.
House Bill 5611-Introduced by
State Rep. Mark Ouimet (R-Scio
Township) on May 9 - passed last
Monday in the House with a 105
to 3 vote. It will allow a National
Hockey League vendor to legally
serve alcohol at the NHL Winter
Classic inside the Big House on
January 1, 2013 and permit alco-
hol companies to advertise on
University premises.
Before the bill went to the
House it unanimously passed
a vote in the House Regulatory
Reform committee.
Ouimet and Cynthia Wilbanks,
the University's vice president for
government relations, testified in
favor of the bill before the com-
mittee on May 16. Ouimet also
testified before the committee

At last Monday's Ann Arbor
City Council meeting, Ann Arbor's
2013 budget was voted on after
much deliberation and even some
amendments to amendments. The
2013 budget will officially start on
July 1.
By the end of the meeting, the
budget was approved despite

Michigan Liquor Control Com-
mission, and Justin Winslow, vice
president of public affairs of the
Michigan Restaurant Associa-
tion, endorsed the bill.
The legal freedom to sell alco-
hol inside the venue was a condi-
tion between the University and
the NHL in order to lease the sta-
dium for an outdoor hockey game
between the Detroit Red Wings
and Toronto Maple Leafs on New
Year's Day.
Inan interview with The Mich-
igan Daily the day after she testi-
fied in Lansing, Wilbanks said
she thought the bill made sense
because it would allow the stadi-
um lease to go through and let the
NHL obtain a temporary liquor
license rather than the University.
Wilbanks said there may be
critics of the bill but she said the
committee seemed receptive.
"I'm sure there may be some
who are not enthusiastic, but I
didn't experience a chilly reaction
to the legislation," she said.
Wilbanks said obtaining liquor
licenses for large sporting events
in Michigan has a history of prec-
edent.

events like the Ryder Cup and
Super Bowl in previous years

In an interview with the Michi-

Arbor MayorJohn Hieftje (D) said
he was pleased with the final bud-
get, which includes slightly less
than $300,000 in surplus for the
city.
"It's a solid budget," he said.
"One of the mistakes that cities
and states make, I think, is when
they have budgets moving forward
that are not funded with recurring
revenues they do one-time fixes -
We didn't do any one-time fixes."
Lumm said the budget did not

reflect the needs of Ann Arbor
residents.
"There were very reasonable
things we could have done to
realign our spending priorities
with what I think are the commu-
nities' priorities, and we failed to
do that," she said after the meet-
ing.
Lumm said there were various
programs and projects that should
have been funded and were not,
adding that they would have been
"minimal added costs in the grand
scheme" of the budget.

Anglin, who voted against the
budget along with Lumm, said that
more preparation in April and May
would have led to more productive
discussion prior to voting.
"It's not the lateness of the hour

budget.
"You never expect to have it

The longest portion of the meet-
ing was dedicated to amending the
2013 budget, several of which con-
cerned the fire department and
safety services within the city.
During a meeting intermission,
Margie Teall (D-Ward 4) said fund-

she said. "I think all the residents

Miller said if the space is used

"I worry that with so many lux-

Maria Saltiel, a Northville resi-

Early on in the meeting, the
council heard from multiple com-

commentary portion.
Esther Choi - an Ann Arbor resi-
dent - said her family has owned a
party store on Broadway for more
than 30 years and that robbery has
been fairly common.
Choi described one incident
where her grandfather had to be
taken to the hospital and another
time when her mother had a knife
held to her neck. She said that the
store has been robbed six times
within the last 10 years in total.
The most recent robbery - on
April 9 of this year - entailed her
father being held up at the gunpoint
of a sawed-off machine gun, accord-
ing to Choi. She said after giving
evidence to the Ann Arbor police,
little headway has been made in the
case.
"Even after this recent incident,
there hasn't been any progress ...
clearlyour requests have been taken
lightly yet again," she said. "These
are not petty crimes; they are life-
threatening, violent crimes."

The spring NCAA champion-
ship season is upon us, and the
Michigan men's track and field
team is a part of it.
This past weekend, the Wol-
verines were represented by nine
individuals in addition to the
4x400-meter relay team at the
three-day NCAA East Prelimi-
nary Meet at the University of
North Florida.
Coming into the meet, Michi-
gan's performance at the Big Ten
Outdoor Championship pushed
the team up 39 spots to No. 31 in
the USTFCCCA Division I nation-
al rankings.
The Wolverines placed ninth
at the conference meet while four
athletes gained All-Big Ten acco-
lades.
"The idea is to be consistent
and to advance," said Michigan
coach Fred LaPlante. "They're
advancing to the elitist level."
And for a handful of the ath-

letes, the team's goal from a week
ago is now a reality.
Fifth-year senior Craig Forys
in the 3,000-meter steeple-
chase, sophomore Ari Arastu for
the 400-meter hurdles, and the
4x400-meter relay team all quali-
fied for the NCAA Champion-
ships.
"The fact that they all made it
is not easy," LaPlante said. "And
to add to the success, our guys
that didn't make it all improved
on their performances and their
rankings. It really doesn't hap-
pen very often and we really per-
formed well."
Forys and Arastu are both mak-
ing their second straight trip to
the national meet after qualifying
for the NCAA Championships on
the second day of competition.
Forys finished second in his
heat for the 3,000-meter steeple-
chase and placed third overall
with a time of 8:38.86, just a two
weeks after a runner-up finish at
the Big Ten Outdoor Champion-
ships.

Meanwhile, Arastu took third
in his heat and sixth overall in the
400-meter hurdles with a time of
50.44.
"I am definitely happy with
my performance," Arastu said.
"I've had faster times before, but I
mean, the whole goal is to make it
to the national meet and I did, so
I look forward to going and con-
tinuing to compete."
It wasn't easy for Arastu, who
struggled during the indoor sea-
son.
"The main thing was getting
faster times," Arastu said. "And
once outdoor season came around
I was in better shape, it was warm-
er, we got to work on the outdoor
track and my 400-meter times got
lower, and that translated to my
success."
On Saturday, the last day of
competition, the 4x400-meter
relay team looked to join Forys
and Arastu at championships.
And they did.
The relay team - comprised
of of senior Nick Neuman, junior

Senior Craig Forys will run in his final NCAA Championships in two weeks.

Aaron Taylor, redshirt junior
Matthew Campbell and fresh-
man Philip Washington - clocked
a season best of 3:06.15 to finish
eighth overall, earning a trip to
Des Moines, Iowa for the champi-
onships.
"The performances themselves
are going to vary in what happens

in the next 10 days from now, but
the fact that you can qualify for
the next meet is great," LaPlante
said. "They're standing out there
with the best."
Forys, Aratsu and the 4x400-
meter relay team will compete in
the NCAA Championships from
June 6-9 in Des Moines, Iowa.

funds as well.
"There's an optimal number of
firefighters for us to staff and we're
trying to get back to the previous
decade (before) we had to cut a lot
of firefighters," she said. "It's been
a tough road to go down, because
we've been experiencing a lot of
cuts from the state revenue shar-
ing."
Stephen Kunselman (D-Ward
3) proposed an amendment that
would've allocated funds from the
Downtown Development Author-
ity to pay for additional firefight-
ing services and jobs. However, the
amendment did not pass after much
consideration.
Kunselman, in an interview dur-
ing the intermission, said that much
of the tax revenue that the DDA col-
lects is not from the DDA's work, but
from unrelated economic develop-
ment.
"That additional (Tax Increment
Financing) money should be com-
ing to the city of Ann Arbor, so that
we can pay for public safety which
has been taking serious cuts over
the years," he said.
Kunselman added that he and
the dissenting councilmembers
disagree about the parameters of a
city government and the success of
the DDA.
"Local government is about pub-

lic health, safety and welfare in my
opinion - that's my priority," he
said. "The economic development
that is proposed out there is all
speculative. "
Aside from items explicitly relat-
ing to the 2013 budget, the council
discussed the North Main-Huron
River Corridor Vision Task Force,
a group focused on bettering the
connection between North Main St.
and the Huron river.
There were originally 10 vot-
ing members and four were added.
However, the fourth spot - intend-
ed for a member of the Ann Arbor
Public Art Commission - garnered
heavy debate.
Members of the council were
concerned that more members
could affect the efficiency of the
task force. Tony Derezinksi (D-
Ward 2) voted for the additional
members and argued for a member
of the AAPAC tobe on the taskforce,
stressing that art is integral to Ann
Arbor.
"We think you have to start at the
beginning when you're doing the
vision rather than looking it, 'Oh we
can add something later that's artis-
tic,' "he said. "We think it's critical
to start with that as part of your
artistic consideration."

resolution for $39,575 of renova-

Second varsity eight wins NCAA title

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
With just two races to go in the
final day of racing at the NCAA
Championships in West Windsor,
N.J., the Michigan women's row-
ing team was all but out of conten-
tion for a national title.
The first and second varsity
eight boats had yet to compete on
Sunday, and the team was in strik-
ing distance of first place.
But Michigan finished second
as a team, clinching its second
runner-up spot in program his-
tory, and its best finish since the
2001 season.
The Wolverines finished just
five points behind Virginia in the
team standings with 82 points.
The first and second varsity
eight boats were the last two to
compete in the three-day NCAA
Championship regatta, and Michi-
gan needed good finishes by both
boats to compete for a team title.

After an hour rain delay, the
second varsity eight took an early
lead from the start - a lead they
wouldn't relinquish.
They beat second-place Ohio
State by nearly two seconds and
finished with a time of 6:37.04,
capping its undefeated season
with a national championship.
"It's a great accomplishment,"
said Michigan coach Mark Roth-
stein. "We're just really happy for
that boat and the seniors."
The victory pulled Michigan
within five points of the cham-
pionship with just one race left.
With a Wolverine win in the first
varsity eight race, and a third-
place-or-lower finish by Califor-
nia, Michigan could walk away
national champions.
But that's not what the rowers
and coaches were worried about.
"When they left shore for
warmups, we didn't know what
the situation was," Rothstein said.
The Wolverines pulled out to an

early lead, but Virginia - who had
posted the fastest times all week-
end - took the lead, and the even-
tual victory. The Cavaliers won by
an impressive boat-length. Vir-
ginia's boat finished with a time
of 6:18.72 while Michigan crossed
the finish in 6:22.09.
"Going in (to the first varsity
eight race) we thought we had
a chance," Rothstein said. "We
knew we had to have our best race
in order to have a chance. I think
we did that, but Virginia was just
a better boat ... they deserve to be
national champions."
Michigan had another boat rac-
ing on Sunday.
The first varsity four finished
sixth in the petite final with a time
of 7:33.75.
"It's a great team," Rothstein
said. "Great senior leadership,
great commitment, (and) a lot of
fun to coach. Probably the most
fun I've had coaching - just a
great group."

Next question: how many years
in a row have the Wolverines been
eliminated in the postseason by
an SEC team? (Google won't be

Congratulations to those indi-

Michigan's fourth consecutive

Final question: What were the
two offensive categories Michi-

2012? (Don't waste your time
looking on Wikipedia either.)
The answers are: at-bats and
runners left on base.
So what does this all mean?
Well for this year's softball squad,
it was the first time in over 10
years that they had lost 17 times
in a season and were once again
outmatched by an SEC opponent.

hitting numbers, Michigan ulti-
mately lost because it left 421 total
runners on base this season.
The Wolverines, facing scru-
tiny for playing an easy schedule
last year, competed against more
ranked opponents ahead of Big

Ten play to be ready for postsea-
son play. They took on teams from
the SEC and Pac-10, risking early
losses for late season victories.
Michigan faced 16 qualifiers in the
NCAA tournament in their first
26 games before arriving home
to play. I overlooked the losses to
unranked teams early on.
And I was rewarded with
middle of the season losses to
mediocre Big Ten teams like Min-
nesota and Illinois, and poorly
played games against Western
Michigan and Eastern Michigan.
Leaving a total of 421 runners
on base this season was a theme
this season - and the players
knew it. Against Illinois, Michi-
gan stranded 29 runners on base
during a three-game series in
which they lost two games.
Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins said they needed eon-
fidence to help build momentum
and said they needed to relax at
the plate, wait for their pitch and
put the ball in play. But in the end,
she was left scratching her head.
"If I knew how, I would have
fixed it by now," Hutchins said
after a May 11 victory over Pur-
due, during which the Wolverines
left 10 runners on base.
But the only thing Hutchins
and Michigan didn't know how
to do, was lose. Having lost just 14
games in the last two seasons, the
Wolverines were in an unfamiliar
place. Seniors Amanda Chidester
and Bree Evans had never lost
more than 12 games in a single
season. This season they lost 12

before the end of April.
Michigan was unaccustomed
to the feeling and didn't post its
longest winning streak until the
end of the season. But this team
still succeeded.
"Our goal this season is to be
the Big Ten champion and con-
tend for a College World Series,"
Hutchins said at the beginning of
the season.
The Wolverines won the Big
Ten title and advanced to the
Super Regional after one of the
toughest Regionals this year.
They lost to the No. 2 team in the
nation on its home field. Let's be
honest - this team knows it's tal-
ented and knows how to win. Its
coach has a proven system of get-
ting her athletes to compete as a
team. No matter what expecta-
tions we as media or fans set, it
won't matter this season, or the
next one. Michigan had its week-
end to reminisce and will move
on to the next without any pres-
sure. I have faith the Wolverines
will come back even stronger next
year, like they did in 2002, when
they came back to make a run
to the Women's College World
Series after losing 17 games the
year before.
Bonus question: Which team
has the reigning Big Ten coach of
the year, pitcher of the year, fresh-
myn of the year, hasn't had a los-
ing season in over 25 years and is
primed to win its sixth consecu-
tive conference championship?
(You won't need any help to
answer this question).

The Michigan softball team
looked like it wanted to force a
rubber game.
After just two innings, the 21st-
ranked Wolverines jumped out
to a 3-1 lead on Alabama, but the
2nd-ranked Crimson Tide rallied
late, earning a berth to the Wom-
en's College World Series and
eliminating Michigan from the
NCAA Tournament in a 4-3 final.
Michigan got an early boost in
the first inning from senior first
baseman Amanda Chidester when
she knocked a pitch from Alabama
hurler Jackie Traina over the left
field fence.
That RBI made her just the
second Michigan softball player
to reach the 200 RBI mark in a
career.
The Wolverines tacked on two
morein the bottom of the second
frame on RBIs from senior third
baseman Stephanie Kirkpatrick
and senior center-fielder Bree
Evans - whose 15-game hitting
streak was the longest by a player
all season.
But Michigan's early lead
wasn't enough. Alabama's pow-
erful hitting was too much for
Michigan's pitching staff.
The Crimson Tide worked the
pitch count to their advantage,
forcing Wolverine lefty Haylie
Wagner to throw 128 pitches in
Friday's matchup.
With the score at 3-1, Alabama's
offense got rolling in the top of the
fifth inning on a two-run home
run by shortstop Kaila Hunt,
which tied the game.
Though Wagner was having
success against the Crimson Tide
batters early in the game by pitch-
ing to the corners; she wasn't able
to hold off one of the best offenses
in the nation.
"Earlier in my at-bats, (Wag-
ner) hadn't been throwing to me,
and earlier in the game, I know
that I made mistakes, so I needed
to step up for my team," Hunt said
of her home run. "She gave me the
pitch, and I just took advantage of
it."
But that wasn't the end of the
scoring. Alabama knocked in
another run on an RBI triple in

the top of the sixth.
Seven Michigan batters later,
the Crimson Tide punched their
ticket to Oklahoma City.
"Hats off to Alabama," said
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins.
"(Jackie) Traina notched it up
there late in the game. She wasn't
on her A-game, but boy she got
on it. It's been fun to be here; it's
been a fantastic tournament. I'm
so proud because we came to play.
We came to win, and we didn't get
it done, but that's awll that you
can ask of your kids is to play to
win."
But the Wolverines might not
even come this far if it weren't
for its star duo of freshman pitch-
ers. Right-hander Sara Driesenga
didn't make a single post-season
appearance, but her role as the
designated player in the clean-up
spot was a boost to the Wolverine
offense.
Wagner, however, finished the
season with the record for fresh-
man wins - 32 - and the most
appearances in the circle with
50. Her performance racked in
conference accolades, as she was
named both the Big Ten Fresh-
man and Pitcher of the Year this
season.
But it wasn't the rookie duo
who led the team this season.
"We had a senior class who had
been to the World Series convinc-
ing kids how difficult it is because
their freshman year they just
thought it was easy," Hutchins
said.
"We push them hard every day
and try to get the message through
that you've got to be at your best
when it's difficult. I thought the
seniorsneeded to take it upon
their shoulders that no matter
what we needed them to not only
perform, but they had to be the
heart and soul of the team."
A few weeks ago, a trip to the
Super Regional looked unlikely
for a faltering Michigan squad,
but Hutchins said this team pulled
together in the end.
"I thought the last three or four
weeks of our season, they really
did that, and they started playing
well," she said.
"They started being selfless.
This team was one of my favorite
groups."

Specific plans
for space remain
undecided

Daily News Editor
Just 18 days before he becomes
the longest-serving U.S. con-
gressman in history, Rep. John
Dingell (D-Mich.) stopped by
Ann Arbor to visit local business-
es and participate in a press con-
ference praising a new report that
suggests research at an alliance
of three of the state's universities
is competitive with research at
similar three-way partnerships
between universities throughout
the country.
Dingell joined Stephen For-
rest, the University's vice presi-
dent for research; Jeff Mason,
executive director of the URC;
Kenneth Nisbet, executive direc-
tor of the University Tech Trans-
fer; and Laura Schrader, CEO
of 3D Biomatrix - a biomedical
company that grew from the Uni-
versity and has developed three-
dimensional cell cultures - to
hold the press conference at the
North Campus Research Com-
plex.
The press conference dis-
cussed the findings of an Ander-
son Economic Group report
called "Benchmarking Michi-
gan's URC." The report explores
the state's University Research
Corridor, an alliance forged in
2006 between the University,
Michigan State University and
Wayne State University in order
to accelerate economic develop-
ment.
The report compared the URC
with six similar alliances includ-
ing clusters of universities in
northern California, southern
California, Illinois, Massachu-
setts, North Carolina and Penn-
sylvania.

The URC ranks first in stu-
dent enrollment and number of
degrees granted - 32,157 in the
2009-10 academic year - and
awards the second most high-
tech and high-demand degrees,
according to the report. The
report also found that the URC is
in the lower half of peer groups
for technology transfer activi-
ties, in which university research
receives patents and transfers
into the private sector for com-
mercialization.
Dingell joked before saying
that the University has spear-
headed American innovation.
"My remarks are going to be
extremely brief at this time, and
I will hope that our participants
in this conference are going to
handle everything so that my
remarks will be held to a mini-
mum to inflict the minimum dis-
comfort on my audience," Dingell
said. "Having said these things,
the University of Michigan is a
tremendous engine for economic
development. What this country
needs to do is what the president
has said: 'out-innovate, out-com-
pete, out-educate.' "
Dingell said the URC is critical
to the future of the U.S. and its
place in the world.
"Places like the University
of Michigan or the University
Research Corridor in Michigan
are goingto do the things we have
to have done to have success," he
said. "To see to it that the Unit-
ed States continues to retain its
rightful place and expands that
place in terms of seeing to it that
we produce jobs, the technology
and the opportunities that are
going to make this country the
leader in the world."
Dingell added that the URC
will continue to help create the
jobs of the future, including
"high-tech" jobs that are essen-
tial to human development.
Forrest said that improving

the regional economy will affect
Michigan and, in turn, the entire
United States as well.
"What I see around us is
we're on the edge of an explo-
sion in innovation," Forrest said.
"I believe this explosion will
drive the revitalization and the
diversification of the regional
economy that will have ripple
effects ... across the entire great
lakes region and really across the
entire nation."
Forrest added that the URC
acts as a catalyst for the regional
economy and is at the same level
as the best in the country, accord-
ing to the benchmark study.
"The conditions are right for
this ecosystem that we're build-
ing. The infrastructure is in
place, the connections are there.
The dynamic innovation ecosys-
tem ... is certainly being estab-
lished right here in Michigan
- and the URC is a key element
of that ecosystem," Forrest said.
Forrest said private sector
collaboration is important and
added that there are already
plans to build an industrial park.
"We want to merge our efforts
with the private sector so we can
start an industrial park here in
Ann Arbor that will be mostly
based on technology, but it will be
open-source for all comers from
around the region and around
the world." he said. "I believe
that Michigan is now gaining the
recognition it deserves as a hot-
bed of innovation that will rival
and perhaps even surpass Silicon
Valley."
Prior to the press conference,
Dingell visited Downtown Home
& Garden at 210 S. Ashley St. and
Lily Grace Cosmetics at 306 S.
Main St.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after the event,
Dingell said the merchants he
spoke with earlier in the day were
concerned with healthcare.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje
was scheduled to attend but was
absent. The city council votes on
the budget today.

Educate the governor
Snyder is making Michigan a dreary state for teachers
As students graduate from the University of Michigan School of
Education and look for teaching jobs here in Michigan, pros-
pects can seem dim. During his term as governor of Michigan,
Rick Snyder has increased funding for unregulated charter schools,
while reducing teachers' salaries and making teachers pay for their
pensions. The state of Michigan, and specifically Governor Snyder,
needs to seriously consider what they want from their school system in
order to encourage talented students to become teachers, as the quality
of public education in Michigan is at stake.

A few years ago, while watching
TV, a commercial came on for a car,
maybe a Chevy, although the car
itself isn't that important. About
halfway through the ad, without
really understanding what came
overume, I began to cry, an act not
too uncommon. Ask many of my
close friends and they'll tellyou just
how much pride I take in my crying
ability. What was unique about this
time, however, was not that I was
crying tears of joy over a commer-
cial, but that my overwhelming joy
had been stirred up by Ray Charles
singing "America the Beautiful."
How this car company obtained
the rights to Ray Charles's rendi-
tion I may never understand. But
what I do understand, after lots of
self-reflection, is from that moment
on I became a patriot.
I wasn't raised to be particularly
patriotic; in fact, a few of my fam-
ily members are very anti-Amer-
ican, or "anti-colonial," as my
grandmother liked to say. I have
no delusions about how perfect
our government is or how morally
superior our history has been. I
don't even think our country has
any superior qualities that set it
apart from any other country. I
just love America like a mother
loves a newborn child, uncondi-
tionally and withoutna necessarily
good reason. The annoying thing
about unconditional love is that
if there is something I don't like
about the U.S., I am either forced
to ignore it or change it, because I
sure as hell can't leave it. Because
of my obligation to our country I
decided to write this article, not to
shamelessly promote the best stu-
dent organization on campus, but
to fix this country in the only way
I know how.
Ask people what they love about
America and most would probably
say freedom or guns, but my opin-
ion on the latter wouldn't allow
me to talk about radio. If you're
wondering how freedom is related
to radio, it's probably because you
have never had the privilege of lis-
tening to WCBN-FM, Michigan's
local, student-run radio station.
If you stop reading here you may
feel deceived. "Hey, I thought you
said you were not going to shame-
lessly promote anything." Yes, you
caught me. I did say it wouldn't
be shameless, but by not doing my

part to promote WCBN, I would
be doing a great disservice to the
Michigan student body and all Ann
Arbor citizens who love freedom.
WCBN is the pinnacle of freedom
at Michigan. It's something that
results in probably the most eclectic
and interesting station in our entire
state, although this is not saying
much as Michigan radio is notori-
ously uninteresting. If you disagree,
it's likely you don't know what good
radio sounds like, or maybe your
idea of good radio is hearing the
same music on repeat. Most radio
stations are owned by media giants
that play just enough variety to keep
people listening. In fact, 80 percent
of radio playlists match. Does this
sound like freedom to you? What is
the point of having so many options
when most of these options are
indistinguishable from one anoth-
er? This is where WCBN comes in.
Few stations do what our station
does in terms of playlist originality
and the promotion of fledgling art-
ists.
Individuality in radio is at stake.
Without the few independent sta-
tions that still exist, like WCBN,
the musical landscape could quick-
ly turn stale. If you think your
favorite types of music are safe
from this, you would be wrong. All
artists start somewhere, and even
huge stars like Lady Gaga have to
be promoted by small venues and
independent stations before they
make it big. If stations like WCBN
disappear, the music world will be
overwhelmed with the same bad
Disney songs that have been haunt-
ing me since elementary school.
There is still hope. If you love
music like I do, you must support
WCBN-FM. Listen, call in to the
station and tell us how good we
sound, and come to the amazing
events we put on. Doing something
to show support will impact our
station because, unlike other stu-
dent organizations, we can be shut
down. That's right. The regents at
the University of Michigan have
the ability to sell our frequency -
88.3 - to make a quick buck, but
you can prevent all that. Help me
save my favorite country by pre-
venting the death of radio.

On May 15, Governor Snyder
signed into law legislation that
will lift the cap on cyber charter
schools from two to five. The cap
will further increase as time goes
on, allowing 10 by 2014 and 15
thereafter. Cyber charter schools
are funded by public money, thus
traditional public schools will
receive less funding. The state
House of Representatives will
also be voting soon on a plan that
requires public school teachers to
pay four to seven percent of their
pension costs.
By lifting the cap on cyber
charter schools, Snyder is using
public money to fund an experi-
mental type of schooling that has
not yet been proven effective, nor
does it operate under the stan-
dards of public schools. For-profit
companies own the cyber char-
ter schools in Michigan. Ronald
Packard, chief executive of K12
- an online education organiza-
tion - owns one charter school
in Michigan and was paid $5 mil-

lion in 2011. It can be reasonably
assumed that companies who
have a profit at stake may view
educating children as a lower
priority. Snyder is essentially
handing away public dollars to
an online education program that
has yet to be proven beneficial for
students.
On Dec. 21, 2011, Snyder lifted
the cap on all charter schools.
While this policy opens up jobs
for new graduates in the charter
school system, charter schools
on average pay a lower salary
than public schools. Most teach-
ers, therefore, want to work in
the public school system. Public
school teaching jobs, however,
are decreasing as Snyder contin-
ues to fund the opening of more
and more charter schools with
taxpayer dollars. If Snyder wishes
to attract the best and brightest"
into the teaching field, continu-
ously reducing teachers' salaries
is not the best way to accomplish
this.

As if the outlook for teachers
didn't already appear dismal, the
Michigan House may pass a bill
that requires teachers to pay more
toward their own pension. Teach-
ers who currently pay nothing
would have to pay 4 percent and
those currently paying between 3
and 6.4 percent would have to pay
7 percent. This is an unfair policy
that only serves to take money
from a group of public employees
who are often overworked and
underpaid.
Teaching is a valuable profes-
sion and a great career option
for many students. With these
new and potentially detrimen-
tal changes, however, Snyder
is making the teaching profes-
sion look less and less desirable.
For the sake of students' educa-
tion and teachers' jobs, Snyder
must reevaluate his changes to
the school system and seriously
consider if cutting public-school
funds is really a wise idea.

FILM REVIEW
'Mn ant itstndtest of time

Third installment of
well-known series
too late to matter
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Arts Writer
Some franchises are best left
dead. Just look at "Indiana Jones."
In two hours, the beloved archae-
ologist went from
Nazi-punching
crusader to a
lame version Men in
of, ironically, Black Ill
"MIB." Other
franchises, when At Quality16
resurrected, are and Rave
a true return to
form (See "Star Columbia
Trek"). "Men in
Black" has been dormant for ten
years - yes, we are getting old -
and unfortunately, "MIB III" is
too little, too late.
Agent J (Will Smith, "I Am
Legend") and Agent K (Tommy
Lee Jones, "Captain America:

The First Avenger") are back. The
question is, should we even care?
"Men in Black II," after all, was a
lazy and obvious moneymaking
chore. Yet despite low expecta-
tions, "MIB III" captures the zany
charm of the original with clever
gags and an uncanny performance
by Josh Brolin ("True Grit").
This time around, J and K
square off against an alien fugitive
called Boris the Animal (Jemaine
Clement, "Despicable Me").
Recently escaped from prison,
Boris is intent on destroying the
world and goes back in time to kill
the only man who can stop him -
K, or a much younger K, played by
Brolin.
It's 1969, and being a time travel
movie, a multitude of cheap time
jokes are available for use. Alas,
writer Etan Cohen ("Tropic Thun-
der") couldn't resist a few "make
love, not war" hippie moments.
Worse yet, "MIB III" sometimes
makes the same mistake its prede-
cessor made - recycled material.
Fifteen years ago, the neuralyzer
was a smart plot device. Now, after

20 minutes, the neuralyzer wears
out its welcome. It's about as cut-
ting edge as a knock-knock joke.
Still, "MIB III" knows when to
call it quits with the cheap humor.
In its 103-minute run time, there's
playful race humor, self-referen-
tial moments that border on nos-
talgia and Smith is as witty and
charming as always. While the
alien designs are nothing special,
"MIB III" finds ways to surprise
us with imaginative gags that are
both sly and slapsticky.
If there's a character worth
knowing better, it'd be K. That's
somethingtime travel plots can do.
They pull us into another time and
make that period immediate to us
in a way flashbacks cannot. Think
of "Back to the Future" and Marty
McFly's chance to see a side of his
parents he never knew existed. We
were living in the 1950s. We were
taking part in the action.
This brings us to Brolin. He
nails Jones's infamous thousand-
yard stare: K looks as unimpressed
as ever. All of K's idiosyncrasies -
and Jones's - remain intact, yet

"4 NOTABLE QUOTABLE
Sure, our health care and social security systems are going to
evaporate in five years. Sure, you'll have to work until you're 80
to support 110-year-old parents who will live forever because of
nano-technology...but that doesn't matter."
- Comedian Andy Samberg giving advice to Harvard's class of 2012
at Class Day, as reported by the Huffington Post,

"That sinybitch"

You will not remember how lame this joke was in 3...2...1

there's a lightness in his character
we've never seen before. He glows
at the thought of his love interest,
Agent O (Alice Eve, "The Raven").
But, ultimately, O is little more
than arm candy. Her relationship
to K is interesting, but not memo-
rable.
The continuity of this trilogy is
episodic. All three are as strong
on their own as they are together.

The questions the film asks of the
characters would've been more
appropriate to answer ten years
ago when "MIB II" first hit the
scene.
It's a shame, really as this lat-
est outing was funny and clever.
Unless the box office can save this
franchise, then it's time to say
goodbye to another part of our
childhood.

TV NOTE IjOK
Ultimate comfort show found in Avatar'

By ANNA SADOVSKAYA
ManagingArts Editor
"Water, earth, fire, air," Katara's
voice introduces the four elements,
and benders of each skill show off
their prowess on screen, whipping
air, stomping out earth, harnessing
fire and controlling water.
When I first saw the opening
sequence for "Avatar: The Last Air-
bender," I was convinced that this
animated, pre-adolescent, Nickel-
odeon-produced show was going to

be a disappointment. Maybe it was
my bitterness over the loss of great
'90s cartoons; maybe it was my
childish need to seem "older" and
"cooler" than Nickelodeon. I was
13, and a year after "Avatar" aired,
I was finally forced by my younger
brother to sit down and watch Ava-
tar Aang and his friends explore the
four nations, get into heaps of trou-
ble and help Aang learn to bend all
four elements
The premise of the show is inter-
esting enough. Aang, a 12-year-old

airbender, is the Avatar - keeper
of peace and master of all four
elements. The Avatar's duty is to
the four nations: Earth Kingdom,
Fire Nation, Water Tribe and Air
Nomads. He is to maintain the bal-
ance and amity between the people
with his abilty to control all four
elements, something no other bend-
er can do. But as Aang realizes his
destiny, the Fire Nation declares
war and obliterates the Air Nomads,
leaving Aangthe last of his kind.
As I was watching the pilot, I
was indeed disappointed - dis-
appointed by my inability to rein-
force my superiority and deem
"Avatar" stupid. Six years later, I
still go back and re-watch old epi-
sodes, finding myself engrossed in
the fictional world.
I watch Katara improve her
waterbending and Sokka fall in
love with the moon spirit. I laugh
at Appa's fondness for food and
the various adventures the group
of friends encounter. It's reassur-

der athletes.
In the most recent issue of
Sports Illustrated, Pablo S. Torre
and David Epstein explorethe dif-
ficulties of transgender athletics.
The story centers around Keelin
Godsey (formally known as Kelly),
a genetically female hammer
throw star who lives his daily life
as a man. If you saw Keelin in per-
son, you would also think he was a
man. In the past, he's been escorted
from a women's bathroom because
of his masculine looks, but on the
field, Keelin Godsey competes as
a woman: He competes in female
events. Godsey has obtained his
masculine looks without hormone
therapy, therefore making him
eligible for the women's Olympic
team, which he will attempt to
qualify for on June 21.
As transgender athletes become
more prevalent, athletic governing
bodies have begun taking measures
to create clear-cut rules for such
athletes. The Olympics requires
athletes having hormone therapy
and gender reassignment surgery
to compete as their chosen gender.
For a woman hoping to compete as
a man, this means hormone ther-
apy and male genitalia. For males
hoping to compete as women, tes-
tosterone suppression and female
genitalia are necessary. The NCAA,
however, took a different approach.
They decided that "genitalia does
not affect athletic ability," and
therefore only hormone therapy is
required.
The Olympics are the pinnacle
of competitions for most athletes.
The rule to require gender reas-

signment surgery shows a high
level of commitment compared to
those who only complete hormone
therapy, which is a reversible pro-
cess. The pressure of the Olympics
is great, and it would not be out of
the question for an athlete to take
advantage of the rules to gain a
slim benefit.
It also makes sense that the
NCAA requires only hormone
therapy for transgender college
athletes, considering gender reas-
signment surgeries can cost up to
five figures, a luxury that many
transgender college students just
can't afford.
These rules seem fair and logical.
They set in place standards so that
everyone is competing on an equal
playing field, which is the reason
sports are separated by sex in the
first place. Where the line begins to
blur is in the social aspect of sports.
What locker room will Godsey
change in at the London Olympics,
should he make the team? How will
male athletes feel if Godsey choos-
es to shower in the male locker
room? Will opposing players call
foul play on his 5-foot-9-inch, 186-
pound build? What pronoun will
the television announcer call him?
But in a women's event, the choice
is more complicated. Does Godsey
need to ask his fellow teammates
if they feel comfortable with him
showering next to them, or should
there be rules and legislation to
handle these questions?
The answers to these questions
are unclear. I would plead for
decency, for people to be mature
enough to ask Godsey his prefer-
ence and for people to express their
feelings if they feel uncomfortable.
Unfortunately, we don't live in that
world. We live in a place where
decency must be made into law
to avoid lawsuits and confusion.
Without these clear-cut regula-
tions, many people feel they would
not be able to live at ease.
Jesse Klein is a LSA sophomore.

It's official. The negative stereo-
typing normally associated with
overweight women now applies to
thin individuals
as well. Heavier
women are no
longer alone in
this brutal world
of discrimina-
tion and judg-
ment based on
body size. The -
even sadder part SARAH
is that women SKALUBA
are being judged
for their body
shape, as well
as participating in this judgment.
These twisted actions have become
a normal part of our society, creat-
ing a division among women. This
mustbe stopped.
If we, as women, can't learn
to respect each other and form
opinions of others based on their
accomplishments and personali-
ties, then how can we ever expect
the media to respect us for who we
truly are and what we've achieved?
If we want to be judged for our
individuality and intelligence,
as opposed to weight and body
shape, then it's time we make some
changes.
Last week on my flight home
to New Jersey, I stumbled across
a surprisingly interesting article
in Glamour Magazine. And no,
I'm not referring to the columns
enlightening Glamour's readers
on how to magically improve their
sex lives or to perfect the coveted
smoky eye with flawless technique.
This article in particular stuck
with me because it explained how
in today's society, discrimination
not only targets heavier women,
but thin women as well.
Dr. Rebecca Puhl of Yale Uni-
versity teamed up with Glamour
Magazine to create a study focused
on bodyweight stereotypes and the
common biases associated with
slender and overweight women.
The study showed that the nega-
tive stereotypes most often asso-
ciated with overweight women
included "slow," "sloppy" and
"undisciplined," while those asso-
ciated with slim women included
"bitchy," "controlling" and "self-
centered." Even more surprising,

the study revealed that slender
women view other slim women as
"superficial" and "conceited," and
similarly, overweight women view
other heavier women as "undisci-
plined" and "lazy." So regardless
of body shape or weight the det-
rimental stereotyping still holds
true.
We need to break this brutal
cycle of constantly stereotyp-
ing one another. Forming judg-
ments without ever engaging in
a conversation or truly getting to
know another person only proves
degrading and destructive for both
parties. I'll be the first to admit
that I've done it in the past; in fact,
I can't think of anyone I know who
hasn't. Making a quick judgment
about another woman based off
of her body and appearance has
sadly become a normal part of the
society we live in today. And if you
happen to be an exception to this
all too common habit, I truly do
applaud you.
Whether you whisper, "She
looks like a huge bitch," to your
friend at a party or silently judge
the overweight woman next to you
in line at Meijer, you are unfairly
stereotyping a woman for her body
and only adding to this already
vicious pattern.
Just because you're slim doesn't
mean you're a conceited bitch,
and it's unfair to assume that all
heavier women are undisciplined
slobs. So why do we think it's OK to
negatively stereotype people we've
never met or even talked to before?
The world in which we live
today places a huge emphasis on
body size and shape. Whether it's
the super-slender models we see
on the runway or the pictures of
celebrities airbrushed to perfec-
tion in magazines, this unrealistic
representation of woman in the
media is unhealthy and detrimen-
tal to the minds of young women.
In today's culture, so many women
aim for the "perfectbody" through
dangerous plastic surgery and
intense dieting. This concept of the
ideal beach bod, however, is com-
pletely unrealistic considering we
are all shaped differently and have
unique traits and characteristics.
If you've had the unfortunate
opportunity to sit through an epi-

sode of E!'s reality show "Bridal-
plasty," then I'm sure you know
firsthand just how absurd the
series is. On the show brides-to-
be "compete for head-to-toe plas-
tic surgery" and the chance to
become the "perfect bride." Both
overweight and thin contestants
compete against each other for the
chance to win liposuction, breast
implants or, my personal favor-
ite, an invitation to an "exclusive
injectables party."
Negative
stereotyping
affects all of us.
The insane message this show
communicates to its viewers is that
the only way to be a happy bride is
to be a perfect one, which is attain-
able solely through mass amounts
of plastic surgery and Botox injec-
tions. Maybe it's just me, but the
concept of "Bridalplasty" as a
whole seems completely degrading
to all women involved, especially
those viewing it on television.
We need to stand up to the unre-
alistic representation of women in
the media and work to break this
vicious cycle of stereotyping one
another based on appearance and
body size. We're worth more than
this and deserve to be judged by
our individuality and intelligence,
not our body weight.
If we want to change society's
norms, it needs to start with us.
Think twice the next time you're
about to silently judge someone
for her body, and speak up when
you hear your friends stereotyp-
ing girls they barely know. It's
time to stop assuming the skinny
girl sitting next to you in class is a
superficialbitch or that the heavier
girl across from you at the library
is a lazy slob. Instead of fighting
this battle against one another, we
should be working together to put
an end to it.

Rather explained that about a
fourth of the book also discusses
the events that led up to his 2006
departure from CBS after work-
ing various positions for 44 years.
"Yes, in the book, there is also
the unpleasant time of when I
was forced to leave CBS News
after reporting first Abu Ghraib,
a story we broke on a worldwide
basis, and following that Presi-
dent George (W.) Bush's service -
or lack of service - in the National
Guard," he said. "I realized that if
I didn't put those important times
in the book, someone would say I
'ducked and dodged.'"
Rather explained that he has
moved on to his current job at
HDNet, and is content there.
"I think it's the best-sustained
work I've ever done in my career
... I never lost my passion for
news," he said. "So what hap-
pened with the Bush story and
Abu Ghraib and others is well
behind me now."
Rather said understanding
what caused the end of his work
with CBS can help others under-
stand journalism.

"At least to this degree, it may
be interesting because it tells
you some of what happens in big
news organizations, what really
happens behind the scenes, as
opposed to what you may think
happens," he said.
Rather also said he thinks
many people have forgotten how
good journalism works.
"Reporters, when they are
at their best, tell tough truths,"
Rather said.
Rather added that reporting of
the civil rights movement in the
1960s is a good example of proper
journalism.
"I never imagined - I didn't
know anybody who could imag-
ine - mayors, sheriffs, county
commissioners would turn high
pressure hoses and attack dogs on
children who were taking part in
peaceful protests," Rather said.
"And when those images were
brought in the living room, there
was repulsion - not everybody
in the country - but there was a
national consensus of repulsion."
Rather said that people forget
that journalists often must take
flak when reporting controversial
truths.
"It's easy to forget at the time
we were doing that coverage, CBS
was called, 'Communist Broad-
casting Company,' ... the camera
crews and others took important
photographs that went in the liv-
ing room and resulted in a nation-
al consensus of outrage," Rather
said. "We tend to forget that, at
that time, that coverage was con-
troversial. CBS took a lot of heat ...
(and) now it's an accepted part of
a national conscience."
Rather explained that good
journalism is often contentious at
the time it is reported, but is also
necessary.
"You learned in seventh grade
civics class ... that a free press, an
independent, truly independent,
fiercely independent press, is the
red, beating heart of freedom and
democracy," Rather said.
Rather added that currently,
journalism in the U.S. is at risk
of staying completely legitimate
due to large companies with news

divisions. He also hinted at big
businesses cutting deals in Wash-
ington.
"Whether that government
is being led at any given time by
Republicans or Democrats, the
huge international corporations
now control more than 80 percent
of our true national distribution of
news in this country," Rather said.
"They need legislation passed,
they need legislation stopped, they
need new regulations that benefit
them, they have favors they need
in Washington, the political pow-
ers in Washington ... they want
of course what I'm going to call
sweet-heart coverage."
Rather believes that there is
increasing pressure on news orga-
nizations to stop asking impor-
tant, tough questions and that
media is also shifting its focus.
"We have so much important
business to do in Washington,"
Rather said. "Entertainment ven-
ues now almost completely over-
whelm news venues."
Anthony Kataer traveled from
Detroit to attend the event and
brought a bag of Rather's past
books.
"I love his political coverage.
he's really articulate," Kater said.
"Even though he's a liberal, you
can't tell that by his coverage."
Kataer added that though
Rather brought up the controver-
sial way he left CBS, he wont hold
it against Rather.
"I don't think we should judge
him for it," he said.
At the book-signing table,
Rather said the 2012 election will
be close.
"I think the election could
be tough," Rather said. "I'm not
saying he will lose, but I think
Obama could lose."
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after the event,
Rather said college students need
to persevere.
"Perseverance is not to be
underestimated, particularly in
today's climate, perseverance
... will beat education, genius
any day of the week," Rather
said. "And don't give up on your
dreams."

change to the Liquor Control Act,"
Wilbanks said.
The Winter Classic has become
a "premier event" in the sports
realm and will help the economy
in Ann Arbor and the surround-

ing area, Ouimet said in a press
release on the Michigan House
Republicans website.
"More than 100,000 people will
contribute to our local economy by
patronizing our restaurants, stay-
ing in our hotels and purchasing
other goods and services," he said
in the release.
In the release, Ouimet also

acknowledged the Classic's poten-
tial for making the Big House
more famous than it already is.
"Michigan Stadium already is
one of the most recognized sport-
ing facilities in the United States,
and the Winter Classic will help
elevate its status to a whole new
fan base, both in this country and
in Canada."
