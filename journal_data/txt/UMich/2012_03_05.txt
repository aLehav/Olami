* THREE ARE THE CHAMPIONS

Under Beilein, giant
of a program awakens

STATE COLLEGE -
They hopped a plane on
Saturday afternoon,
these Wolverines, and
began the short journey to
Happy Valley, dreams dancing
through their heads uncontrol-
lably, as if they were again the
naive children they once were.
They knew full well what lay
ahead of them, what one more
win - one final triumph in the
long, dark alleyway otherwise
known as the Big Ten confer-
ence schedule, where street
fights masquerade as basketball
games - would give them.
They knew there was a
chance that the countless hours
spent grunting through another
mundane set in the weight
room, the myriad windsprints
that tore at their lungs and the
endless film sessions that some-
times left their heads spinning
would end in their redemption.
There was a chance it would
end in the exoneration of the
sometimes-ascetic life they had

doomed themselves to as Divi-
sion-I basketball players.
Yet it was only that - a
chance. These Michigan players
could do their part by defeating
Penn State, one of the confer-
ence's ugly
ducklings
this season.
But after
that, they

for them and

to a place no Wolverine had
been for more than a quarter of
a century.
It's a cruel fate, not being in
control.
Above all else, athletes crave
the ability to settle matters
themselves.

ANN ARBOR PUBLIC [RANS|T
City Council
to decide on
countywide
transit plan

BUS BACK TO REALITY

Proposal would
increase travel
accessibility for
students
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
An Ann Arbor City Council
vote today to change the city's
transit law and allow for the
implementation of a county-
wide transit system could make
transportation for students
in the Ann Arbor area more
expansive and accessible.
Last fall, the Ann Arbor
Transportation Authority
created a financial task force
composed of business lead-
ers, public officials, Ann Arbor
residents and community
groups. The group worked for
18 months to form the 30-year
mass transit plan, according to
an AATA press release.
The proposed plan will begin
with a pilot five-year transit
program with recommenda-
tions from the task force. Such
improvements and accessibil-
* ity enhancements include bus
replacements, local transit
hubs, park and ride intercept
lots and vanpool services.
Councilmember Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1) said the group mas-
tered most of what was needed

to move forward with the mass
transit system.
"The financial task force was
asked what they recommend
for the first five years and then
turn around and say how we are
going to get there," Briere said.
"They didn't quite achieve the
last part, but they did achieve
the first part, how many dol-
lars they need over the first five
years with 6 million a year."
According to Briere, there
was significant pressure from
within the community to
expand AATA's current ser-
vices. In response to the input,
AATA researched its legal
scope of service and decided to
make appropriate changes.
"The (mass transit system)
better fit the long-term goal for
AATA of bus rapid transit," Bri-
ere said. "An unincorporated
board was formed that hired a
firm, using grant dollars, to do
the research."
The mass transit plan grew
out of the research conducted
by the firm, the board and from
information gathered during60
to 70 public meetings attended
by more than 1,200 individuals,
Briere said.
Briere said that while AATA
already provides free transpor-
tation for students accessible,
the changes include more fre-
quent transportation that will
allow more access around Ann

treatment
Discovery could
kill bacteria
resistant to

By JOSH QIAN
Daily StaffReporter
For students prone to viral
infections, a group of Uni-
versity researchers may have
uncovered more effective
treatment methods that avoid
production of new, antibiotic-
resistant bacteria.
Specifically, the research
team identified a collection
of synthesized molecules
from the University's Center
for Chemical Genomics that
might effectively treat Group
A Streptococcus bacterial
infection, commonly known
as strep throat. The project,
funded by the National Insti-
tute of Health, the Innovation
Partnership - an initiative of
the University's Life Sciences
Institute - and the How-
ard Hughes Medical Insti-
tute, could potentially help
patients battling the illness in
the future.
The research team is co-
headed by David Ginsburg,

cine and faculty member in

State legislators,
'U' administrators
share perspective
on legislation
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
The implementation of a medi-
cal amnesty program on cam-
pus is taking on a two-pronged
approach as University students
commence discussions with Uni-
versity administrators and state
government leaders.
A medical amnesty program
at the University would prevent
underage students who call for
aid in cases of over-consumption
of alcohol from receiving Minor

in Possession of Alcohol citations.
Proponents of medical amnesty
believe the program will lead to
fewer alcohol-related deaths and
injuries and more calls for medi-
cal attention.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said he has been in con-
tact with several students about
this issue and is supportive of
establishing a program at the
University.
"Ithink it's goingto save lives,"
Irwin said. "(It's) definitely going
to make people more willing to
come forward when they think
that friend might be in trouble
and might need some help."
Though Irwin is not a spon-
sor, he said he supports House
Bill 4393, legislation that would
amend the Michigan Liquor Con-
trol Code of 1998 and implement

a statewide medical amnesty
program. Currently, the bill is on
its third read and is waitingto be
voted on by the state House.
"It looks like it's goingto make
it out of the house," Irwin said.
"This idea has been around for a
while. A number of other states
(have medical amnesty) because
it works."
LSA junior Aditya Sathi, vice
speaker of Central Student Gov-
ernment's Student Assembly,
introduced a passing resolution
in January supporting a medical
amnesty program.
"(We're) coming at it from
a top-down and a bottom-up
approach," Sathi said.
Currently, more than 800 Uni-
versity students and faculty have
signed an online petition in favor

Dublin saint's

stolen from church
Officials at Christ Church
Cathedral in Dublin said yes-

church's most precious relic: the
preserved heart of St. Laurence
O'Toole, patron saint of Dublin.
O'Toole's heart had been dis-
played in the cathedral since the
13th century. It was stored in a
heart-shaped wooden box and
secured in a small, square iron
cage on the wall of a chapel dedi-
cated to his memory. On Saturday
someone cut through two bars,
pried the cage loose, and made off
with the relic.
Ireland's national police force,
the Garda Siochana, said detectives
were studying hours of closed-
circuit TV footage to try to identify
the approximately 40 people who
walked out the cathedral's front
doors Saturday morning.

Russia amid controversyv

Opponents to
stage large-scale
rally in Moscow
today
MOSCOW (AP) - Vladimir
Putin scored a decisive victory
in Russia's presidential elec-
tion yesterday to return to the
Kremlin and extend his hold on
power for six more years. His
eyes brimming with tears, he
defiantly proclaimed to a sea
of supporters that they had tri-
umphed over opponents intent
on "destroying Russia's state-
hood and usurping power."
Putin's win was never in
doubt as many across the
vast country still see him as
a guarantor of stability and
the defender of a strong Rus-
sia against a hostile world, an
image he has carefully culti-
vated during 12 years in power.
Accounts by independent
observers of extensive vote-
rigging, however, looked set
to strengthen the resolve
of opposition forces whose
unprecedented protests in
recent months have posed
the first serious challenge to
Putin's heavy-handed rule.
Another huge demonstration
was set for this evening in cen-
tral Moscow.
Putin claimed victory last
night when fewer than a
quarter of the votes had been

counted. He spoke to a rally
just outside the Kremlin walls
of tens of thousands of sup-
porters, many of them govern-
ment workers or employees of
state-owned companies who
had been ordered to attend.
"I promised that we would
win and we have won!" Putin
shouted to the flag-waving
crowd. "We have won in an
open and honest struggle."
Putin, 59, said the election
showed that "our people can
easily distinguish a desire
for renewal and revival from
political provocations aimed at
destroying Russia's statehood
and usurping power."
He ended his speech with
the triumphant declaration:
"Glory to Russia!"
The West can expect Putin
to continue the tough policies
he has pursued even as prime
minister, including opposing
U.S. plans to build a missile
shield in Europe and resisting
international military inter-
vention in Syria.
Exit polls cited by state
television predicted Putin
would get about 59 percent of
the vote. With more than 80
percent of precincts counted
nationwide, Putin was lead-
ing with 65 percent, the Cen-
tral Election Commission said.
Complete results were expect-
ed today.
Communist Party candi-
date Gennady Zyuganov was
a distant second, followed by

Mikhail Prokhorov, the bil-
lionaire owner of the New Jer-
sey Nets whose candidacy was
approved by the Kremlin in
what was seen as an effort to
channelsome ofthe protest sen-
timent. The clownish national-
ist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and
socialist Sergei Mironov trailed
behind. The leader of the lib-
eral opposition Yabloko party
was barred from the race.
"These elections are not
free. ... That's why we'll have
protests tomorrow. We will
not recognize the president
as legitimate," said Mikhail
Kasyanov, who was Putin's
first prime minister before
going into opposition.
The wave of protests began
after a December parliamenta-
ry election in which observers
produced evidence of wide-
spread vote fraud. Protest ral-
lies in Moscow drew tens of
thousands in the largest out-
burst of public anger in post-
Soviet Russia, demonstrating
growing exasperation with
the pervasive corruption and
tight controls over political life
under Putin, who was presi-
dent from 2000 to 2008 before
moving into the prime minis-

Verdict may impact
nation-wide debate
over definition of
motherhood
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP)
- A custody battle in Florida
between two lesbians could fuel
the growing national debate over
the definition of motherhood.
It also might force state law-
makers to reconsider a 19-year-
old law regarding the rights of
sperm and egg donors.
The women, now in their 30s
and known in court papers only
by their initials, were both law
enforcement officers in Florida.
One partner donated an egg that
was fertilized and implanted in
the other. That woman gave birth
in 2004, nine years into their
relationship.
But the Brevard County couple
separated two years later, and the
birth mother eventually left Flor-
ida with the child without telling
her former lover. The woman who
donated the egg and calls her-
self the biological mother finally
tracked them down in Australia
with the help of a private detec-
tive.
Their fight over the now
8-year-old girl is before the state
Supreme Court, which has not
announced whether it will con-
sider the case. A trial judge ruled
for the birth mother and said the
biological mother has no paren-
tal rights under state law, adding
he hoped his decision would be
overturned.
The 5th District Court of
Appeal in DaytonaBeachobliged,
sidingwith the biological mother
and saying both women have
parental rights.
At issue is the 1993 state law
meant to regulate sperm and egg
donation. Scholars debate wheth-
er the constitutional right to pro-
create includes outside-the-body
technologies used to conceive.
Also at issue are constitutional
questions about gay people's right
to raise children and claim equal
protection under law. Another
appellate court ruled Florida's
ban on gays being able to adopt
unconstitutional in 2010.
The biological mother, how-
ever, isn't concerned about being
a legal or social pioneer, her law-
yer said. She just wants her child
back in her life.
"She hasn't seen her daughter
in years, and it's been terribly,
terribly difficult for her," said
Robert A. Segal, a family law
attorney in Melbourne.
The battle over what defines
motherhood is being played out
on prime-time television shows
and in courtrooms across the
country.
More recently, former North
Carolina state Sen. Julia Bose-

man, the first openly gaymember
of that Legislature, is suing for
joint custody of a 2-year-old son
born to a woman Boseman had
called her spouse.
In the Florida case, the women
agreed to use "reproductive med-
ical assistance," have a child and
raise that child as a couple, court
records show.
It's unknown why they later
decided to separate, but "their
separation does not dissolve the
parental rights of either woman,
nor does it dissolve the love and
affection either hassfor the child,"
the appellate decision said.
The birth mother cites the
state's law on sperm and egg
donation, which says that donors
"relinquish all maternal or pater-
nal rights," to argue that the bio-
logical mother wasn't the child's
parent.
"We can discern no legally
valid reason to deprive either
woman of parental rights to this
child," said the majority opin-
ion by Judge Thomas Sawaya.
He ruled that the donor law was
unconstitutional as applied in the
case.
That law was passed 15 years
after Louise Brown, the world's
first "test tube" baby, was born.
But Judge David Monaco, in a
concurring opinion, said the stat-
ute "was not designed to resolve
the problem of how to treat chil-
dren bornbyin vitro fertilization
to a same-sex couple."
But in a blistering dissent,
Judge C. Alan Lawson said the
trial judge got it right. A child can
have only one mother, he wrote.
The court shouldn't recognize
two mothers "unless we are also
willingto invalidate laws prohib-
iting same-sex marriage, bigamy,
polygamy or adult incestuous
relationships on the same basis,"
Lawson said.
Monaco and Lawson agreed,
however, that the Legislature
needs to pass new law on the sci-
ence of human reproduction to
reflect the times.
"We think we're solving prob-
lems with technology, but it just
leads to more problems," said
Alan Williams, a health law pro-
fessor at Florida Coastal School
of Law in Jacksonville. "Moral
and ethical dilemmas arise that
laws were never made to deal
with."
Florida voters adopted a con-
stitutional amendment banning
same-sex marriage in 2008.
Shannon McLin Carlyle, an
appellate attorney who also
is representing the biological
mother, said the majority didn't
come up with a gay rights deci-
sion: "It's a pro-parent decision."
"But it does solidify gay cou-
ples' right to retain a relationship
with their child," she said. "If it
goes the other way, parenthood
could be subject to risk on the
whim of the other partner."

Polish gov't claims trains
still safe after deadly crash

Masses of soccer
fans will use
system for Euro
2012 tournament
SZCZEKOCINY, Poland
(AP) - Poland's government
insisted yesterday that rail trav-
el is safe in the country despite
a train collision that killed 16
people, assurances that come
months before masses of sports
fans will enter the country for
a major soccer tournament -
many of whom will crisscross
the nation by train.
Saturday night's crash,
Poland's mostly deadly rail
tragedy in more than two
decades, raised new questions
about the safety of a state-run
rail network, which has under-
gone modernization in recent
years. Poland still has a rail sys-
tem marked by the legacy of the
communist decades, but has
been working to upgrade trains
and tracks.
The trains collided head-on
in a shower of sparks and man-
gled metal, killing 16 people
and injuring dozens more near
the southern town of Szczeko-
ciny, just north of Krakow. Both
trains inexplicably ended up
running on the same track. Pol-
ish leaders said it was the worst
rail tragedy since 16 people
were killed in a 1990 collision
near Warsaw.
Some routes today are noto-
rious for being slower than
they were even before World
War II - and the economical-

ly dynamic young member of
the European Union has been
pushing to change this even
as it builds skyscrapers, high-
ways and stadiums. Several of
the construction projects have
been accelerated by the coming
Euro 2012 soccer champion-
ship, which starts in June.
Transport Minister Sla-
womir Nowak insisted that
train travel is safe and that
the government makes safety
a priority as it improves the
system. The collision occurred
on a stretch of track that was
recently modernized, but offi-
cials said it was too early to
speak about a cause.
"I really believe that the
train system - not only in
Poland but all of Europe - is
still very safe," Nowak said.
He said those who plan to
use the trains this summer
during Euro 2012 should not
worry. Poland is co-hosting
the three-week tournament
with Ukraine, and games will
be held in several Polish and
Ukrainian cities, which will
force some fans to travel large
distances - either by train,
plane, bus or car.
President Bronislaw
Komorowski called for two
days of national mourning
today and tomorrow, mean-
ing that flags will fly half-staff
at public building's, and con-
certs and sporting events will
be canceled. Poland's Roman
Catholic bishops also called for
prayers for those killed and the
injured.
Interior Minister Jacek
Cichocki said rescue officials

believe they have retrieved
all bodies from the wreck-
age because sniffer dogs have
not found any other traces of
corpses.

The state Legislature overreached with SB 971
Throughout much of last year, the nation watched a labor bat-
tle unfold in Wisconsin. In February 2011, Republican Gov.
Scott Walker introduced legislation to narrowly limit public
employees' collective bargaining rights in Wisconsin. The changes
- in effect as of March 2011 - sparked some of the most dramatic
political activism in years. Thousands occupied the state's capitol,
Democratic lawmakers left the state to avoid a vote and eventually the
state's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Walker's proposals. In Michi-
gan and at the University, the debate over graduate student research
assistants' classification - a collective bargaining issue on a smaller
scale - has come to a halt. The Michigan Legislature has passed a bill
classifying GRSAs as students, not employees, thereby sidestepping
ongoing official proceedings. The state has set a dangerous precedent
by circumventing existing legal processes and proactively inhibiting
collective bargaining.

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

When a scandal of epic
proportions erupted at
Penn State University
early last November, Penn State's
student newspaper was quick to
pounce. In an editorial printed
the Monday after the story broke,
The Daily Collegian opined:"The
moral failure of every single person
involved is appalling ... The univer-
sity has brought shame upon itself."
It was a bold stance only com-
paratively - criticizing those who
cover up a sex scandal is usually
very easy. But in the campus envi-
ronment that enveloped Penn State
in the immediate aftermath of that
scandal - where students seemed
more concerned with defending
head football coach Joe Paterno
than condemning former assis-
tant football coach and accused
child abuser Jerry Sandusky - the
Collegian showed great courage
in mincing no words and direct-
ing blame squarely on Penn State
University officials for the scope
of the problem and cover-up. The
Collegian's subsequent coverage of
the scandal, all the way up to this
weekend, has also been thorough,
inquisitive and excellent.
Nevertheless, a question
remains: Where was the Collegian
for all those years while Sandusky
was committing crimes, and Penn
State was covering them up?
Of course, I'm not suggesting
that Penn State's student news-
paper is at fault, legally or other-
wise, for anything that occurred.
I'm merely stating that, if such a
scandal played out on campus for
more than a decade, and no report-
er from the Collegian ever found
enough to break the story, the
newspaper failed the Penn State
community on some level. And
there are important lessons there
for The Michigan Daily.
That investigative reporting is

dead is a common complaint - one
that finds its way into my public
editor inbox from time to time.
However, there are special chal-
lenges that college newspapers
face on this front. Among them,
college reporters are hamstrung by
their brief tenures: They don't get
to build the kind of contacts and
connections that can yield leads for
investigative stories. Institutional
knowledge and understanding is
lost as quickly as it's built, as class
after class of the best and most
experienced reporters graduate.
But these cannot be excuses.
The Daily's bylaws stress the ideal
of investigative journalism with
implorations such as: "Be vigi-
lant and courageous about holding
those with power accountable." And
indeed, on many occasions the Daily
has proudly lived up to those ideals.
Five years ago, when the Uni-
versity was "repairing" Michigan
Stadium - and bizarrely insisting
that it had no obligation under the
Americans with Disabilities Act to
add accessible facilities and seating
- the Daily was one among many
strong critics of the administration's
stance. Without taking too much
credit, it's still fair to say that the
Daily's determined effort over sev-
eral months, spanning many incisive
news stories and unrelenting edi-
torials, played an important role in
ensuring that the University eventu-
ally did comply with the ADA.
Sadly, there is no one on staff
today who was at the Daily when
that ADA debate played out. There
is no one left who can apply those
lessons and build on them for
issues that emerge today. This is
a problem, but one that the Daily
must overcome.
The broad entreaties I've made
here have very practical conse-
quences. For example, while the
Daily reported on the allegations

involving former University medi-
cal resident Stephen Jenson after
he was arrested and the story
broke publicly, the newspaper
failed this campus by not being
able to break the story for the more
than six months during which vari-
ous officials within the University
kept it silent.
This is a tough, perhaps even
unfair, criticism. Nevertheless,
given the standard by which the
Daily judges itself, it is a criticism
that this paper must admit and
work to overcome. There's cer-
tainly no fault of any one person
individually, or even any one class
of editors. Rather, the Daily as
an institution has lost something
structural in its very purpose if a
thing like the Jenson investigation
(or lack thereof) can go undiscov-
ered for more than six months. This
paper must evaluate what it can do
to ensure that it is able to discover
such stories and break them.
Reporting practices and inves-
tigative techniques (things I won't
pretend to be an expert on) will be
an important part of this discus-
sion. However, there is also a sim-
pler question the editors should
mull - one whose answer is broad,
but may well be a remedy: What
more can this paper do to assure
that any member of the campus
community who, upon finding no
recourse for his grievances within
official University channels, imme-
diately picks up the phone and calls
the Daily?

Coleman should help
affected Levaquin patients
TO UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT MARY
SUE COLEMAN:
In addition to being the University presi-
dent; you are also a board director at Johnson
& Johnson. I have been disabled for over six
years from Levaquin, an antibiotic marketed
by your company. My family sent medical
documentation on Levaquin to you. We asked
that you initiate medical research in an effort
to help those of us that are suffering. We never
heard back from you.
The beginning sentence of the famous J&J
Credo states the following: "We believe our
first responsibilityis to the doctors, nurses and
patients, to mothers and fathers and all others
who use our products and services." The credo
also states the following: "We are responsible
to the communities in which we live and work
and to the world community as well."
As aboard director at Johnson & Johnson, I
feel that you have an ethical and moral respon-
sibility to honor the credo. You have profited at
the expense of many people that have suffered
devastating long-term injuries from Levaquin.

TO THE DAILY:
The article "Students frustrated by lack of
accommodations during trip to Punta Cana"
gives a version of these guys' vacation that, in
our opinion, is far from objective. Therefore, I'd
like to make the following points:
1. The tour operators didn't made reserva-
tions for all students as a group, but from dif-
ferent sources and as individuals, taken one by
one.
2. Student City didn't specify the means of
payment, so up to two days before the arrival
of the students they hadn't made reservations.
3. That once students arrived in Punta Cana
all possible solutions to house the group were

Those severely affected by Levaquin have
often lost not only their health but also their
job and income. Many have been bankrupted
with enormous medical bills. Indiyiduals
and families have been devastated physically,
emotionally and financially. Jenne Wilcox,
a young school teacher lost her job and her
home after taking Levaquin. Over three years
later, she requires a wheelchair. Her story can
be viewed on a national PBS news segment. A
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Freedom
of Information Report for Levaquin reveals
that 20,243 Individual Safety Reports are list-
ed for this drug from November 1, 1997 to May
31, 2011.
I made a difficult trip to your company
shareholder meeting. I gave a respectful
speech to you and the other board directors.
The phrase "Caring for the World, One Patient
at a Time" was mentioned numerous times by
your company. Mary Sue Coleman: You have
an opportunity to show leadership by honor-
ing the values of your corporate credo, into a
commitment to help those that have suffered
immensely from your prescription drug.

so Student City was to host the party in the
Presidential Suites complex.
4. The huge consumption of alcohol by stu-
dents caused some ugly incidents to the hotel
and its customers. For example: Constant fights
amongstudents, "nudist shows" inthe facilities
ofahotel which, as the article describes, is usu-
ally frequented by families with children, and
damage to several public areas - such as bro-
ken windows, broken furniture, doors broken
off their hinges and so on.
Clearly, things weren't done right from the
start. We try to mitigate the problem if pos-
sible, and we suffered the consequences. I
assure you that in this story we are victims,
not perpetrators.

Luckily for
those following the competition for
the Republican presidential nomina-
tion, Tuesday's primaries provided
surprising excitement. In Michigan,
Mitt Romney defeated Rick Santo-
rum by a slim four-percent margin.
The media had already been
buzzing about earlier remarks from
the lead candidates in Michigan.
Liberals attacked and Republicans
hit their heads against walls when
Santorum called the president a
"snob" for wanting all Americans
to go to college. Neither liberals
nor conservatives knew what to say
when Romney said he was glad to be
back in his home state because "the
trees are the right height." (By the
way, The Huffington Post reports
this wasn't a flub, he's been using
the line for years. And he's right, we
do have nice trees.)
However, the wacky one-liners
that have constituted much of the
GOP nomination circus, took a back
seat in coverage of Michigan's prima-
ries. In a strange turn of events, com-
menters weighed in on actual votes.
With only 30 delegates, Michigan
isn't a golden ticket to the nomina-
tion. Instead, it served as an impor-
tant testing ground for Romney's
campaign. If I wasn't busy crying
alone on Valentine's Day, I would
have given someone a line from The
Washington Post blogger Alexandra
Petri, "I'm as set on you as the GOP
isn't on Mitt." Republicans simply
can't settle on Romney. He and his
totally non-affiliated super PACs
outspent Santorum by nearly $1.2
million in Michigan. This is Rom-
ney's home state - his father was
an auto executive and former gov-
ernor - if he couldn't win here, it

would be an embarrassing testa-
ment to his unpopularity.
The importance of the litmus
test was not lost on reporters, pun-
dits, Michigan voters or Santorum's
campaign. Right before the primary,
polls showed Santorum and Romney
neck-and-neck.
The opportunity was clear.
It didn't take a political savant to
see the benefits of a Santorum win
in Michigan. In liberal mindsets, it
would move toward the best-case
scenario: pitting President Obama
against Santorum in November.
With much of Santorum's agen-
da insulting to anyone who isn't
a white, Christian male, Obama
would face a much weaker oppo-
nent than Romney.
That probably won't happen. As
has been expected from the begin-
ning, Romney will most likely take
the nomination. Even so, a Santorum
win would have been an embarrass-
ing blow to Romney's campaign.
Losing to Santorum would be an
affront to anyone's self-esteem -
unless it was a "saying offensive
things" contest. It would force Rom-
ney to double down, spend more
money and make him appear weaker
in the general election.
Either way you spin it, a Santo-
rum win was a Democratic win.
And thanks to Michigan's open
primary system - no need to be a
registered party member - Obama
supporters could do more than
hope: they could vote.
The Santorum campaign was
aware of the sentiment. Strange -
I didn't think self-awareness was
Rick's thing. In the days leading
to the vote, the campaign paid for
robocalls to thousands of Michigan
Democrats, urging them to help
defeat Romney. While the campaign
defended the move as an appeal to
Reagan Democrats, it was logical
political strategy.
It appeared to have some success.
CNN exit polls showed 9 percent of
voters in the Republican race were
Democrats. Of them, 53 percent
voted for Santorum. Usually liberal
cities like the Detroit suburb of Fern-
dale gave the former Senator clear
wins over Romney.
The Democratic intrusion was an
interesting turn in primary coverage

and spiced up the already close race.
Twitter was atweet with "democrats
take over #MIprimary" and televi-
sion pundits speculated on its sig-
nificance on the outcome.
The Romney camp quickly con-
demned Santorum calling the robo-
calls a "dirty trick." It also gave
them an excuse for the close race
in his home state - where none of
his current five homes are, by the
way - Santorum and Democrats
attempted to "kidnap our primary
process." Aside from using "hijack"
instead of "kidnap," George W. Bush
used the same excuse in 2000 when
Michigan Democrats helped Sen.
John McCain defeat him by a large
margin. Some, like Detroit Free
Press cartoonist Mike Thompson,
criticized Democrats who voted for
Santorum for breaking the sanctity
of elections.
Voters can
be as dirty as
politicians.
I find this logic difficult to follow.
Kidnapping and hijacking are illegal
activities. The robocalls were sad,
desperate and in bad taste, but not
illegal. Using your vote not for the
candidate you support, but in a more
calculated and political way isn't a
new tactic. Not particularly elegant,
but not cold-blooded or fraudulent.
Take a quick look at the state of
those who lead our country - dirty
politics knows few boundaries.
If so many of our elected officials
are playing rough to get their way,
why condemn voters for doing so?
In a year when the GOP is using
fear and nonsense to rally its base,
it's encouraging that Democrats
thought politically and kindled the
fiery madness. Politicians started
this game, and voters are simply
playing by the rules.

Star-studded voice
cast brings new
color to classic
By ARIELLE ACKERMAN
Daily Arts Writer
It's hard to mess up a kid's
movie, but it's easy to mess up
one based on a Dr. Seuss story:
case in point,
"The Cat in the
Hat." Thank-
fully, "Dr. Dr. Seuss'
Seuss' The
Lorax" sticks The LoraX
to its Seuss At Quality16
roots, even and Rave
though the sto-
ryline strays Universal
a bit from the
original. With new characters
and subplots, "The Lorax" is
sure to entertain both the little
ones and the adults watching.
The creators of "Despicable
Me" bring us this wildly color-
ful and touching tale of environ-
mentalism in kid-friendly form.
Pretty much everyone knows
the story of "The Lorax." You've
probably had it read to you a few
times on Earth Day. But in this
version, a boy named Ted (Zac
Efron, "17 Again") goes in search
of a real tree in order to impress
his high-school crush Audrey
(Taylor Swift, "Valentine's
Day"). His spunky grandma
(Betty White, "The Proposal")
instructs him to find the Once-
ler, and so begins Ted's quest to
learn about the trees.
Facing off against an evil zil-
lionaire who makes his money
selling fresh, packaged air, Ted
has a few obstacles to conquer
along the way. The villain, who
has "Frankenstein's head on

"One does not simply cut down a truffula tree."

a spider's body," is comically
reminiscent of a few CEOs out
there today. The whole message
of the movie revolves around an
anti-greed, pro-environmental
stance. At times, it can be a bit
preachy, especially for a chil-
dren's film, though its moral will
probably fly right over its young-
er viewers' heads.
Efron does an impressive job
with the voice acting, and his
character Ted is extremely like-
able and funny. Other standout
voice actors include Jenny Slate
(a former member of TV's "Sat-
urday Night Live"), who plays
Ted's mom, and Ed Helms ("The
Hangover"), who voices the
Once-ler. Danny Devito's (TV's
"It's Always Sunny in Philadel-

phia") voice is so distinct that
you can almost picture him
in place of the actual Lorax;
it doesn't help that he and the
"speaker of the trees" are simi-
lar in shape, too.
The animation is in typical
Seuss style: people with sloped
noses and round eyes, trees that
don't actually look like trees and
some cute woodland creatures.
The singing fish are especially
attention-grabbing, as is the
adorably overweight bear who
towers over the others.
The movie also has a few
musical pieces incorporated
throughout. They're sort of a
cheap ploy to keep the kids'
attention, but they're enter-
taining nonetheless. Surpris-

ingly enough, Taylor Swift has
no major singing parts, though
you'd expect movie execs would
exploit her for all she's worth.
It's kind of ironic that a huge
corporation like Universal is
producing a movie with an anti-
corporate message. They don't
downplay it at all, either. In
fact, the moral of the movie is so
often repeated that you'll walk
away reciting "unless someone
like you cares a whole awful
lot, nothing is going to get bet-
ter. It's not." Hopefully, some
kids and adults who watch "The
Lorax" will leave the theater
having learned something, but
most will probably just walk out
humming a few catchy tunes
from the flick.

Creative simplicity in
'Rhythm' mini-games

"I'm flattered, but frankly not interested."
A lackluster movie

'Wanderlust' roams
between comedy
and endearment
By ADITI MISHRA
DailyArts Writer
It's ironic that the word "wan-
derlust" refers to a strong desire
to travel and yet the film in ques-
tion is, at it's
core, all about*
settling down.
To be honest, Wanderlust
it isn't your
generic, soppy At Quality16
rom-com. It's and Rave
moderately
heartwarm- Universal
log, occasion-
ally (okay, maybe a bit more than
that) funny and somewhat like-
able. If you're keeping up with the
adverbs, you'll see where this is
going: "Wanderlust" is forthright
and unpretentious about what it
truly is - average.
But that's OK. It's sort of like
liking someone who's not trying
too hard or admiring someone
for accepting their flaws. So on
the one hand, you hate director
David Wain ("Role Models") for
not trying harder (how could you
not dream big when your film's
based in a hippie commune?), but
you also can't help but forgive
him for his honesty and for hav-
ing a bit of fun.
"Wanderlust" begins with

the average Manhattan lives of
George (Paul Rudd, "Dinner for
Schmucks") and Linda (Jenni-
fer Aniston, "Horrible Bosses").
George hates his job, but it pays
the rent, while Linda has too
many jobs that pay nothing. As
George's brother says, they have
the worst of both worlds - a
tiny apartment and a huge mort-
gage. When George gets fired
and Linda's documentary about
penguins gets rejected by HBO,
they're forced to pack up their
lives and move south.
Afewthousand miles and afew
hundred arguments later, they
wind up exhausted on the doors
of Elysium Bed and Breakfast (of
course, it isn't really a B&B). This
large hippie commune, with its
naked winemakers and ayahuas-
ca-drinking vegans, comes as a
shock to George and Linda. But
it's the only rent they can afford,
openingthe door to a whole wide
world of eccentricities and weir-
dos.
Unsurprisingly, George gets
excited about the prospect of
enjoying life and living care-
free, and Linda is weirded out
by the open relationships and
pot smoking. But eventually, it's
Linda's turn to have a bit of fun
and George's to get a little quea-
sy (after that natural-birthing
scene, who can blame him?). The
only thing they haven't adopted
is an open relationship, but when
Linda agrees to that choice and
sleeps with commune leader Seth

(Justin Theroux, "Your High-
ness"), things really start to fall
apart.
"Wanderlust" just wants to be
a heartfelt comedy about finding
out what "home" really means. Is
home where the shiny buildings
and delectable cafes of Manhat-
tan are nestled? Or, quite sim-
ply, is home where the heart is?
It's a romantic comedy, so you
know which agenda this movie's
pushing. It succeeds in most
ways because Rudd and Aniston
are genuine and adorable. They
might not be the best actors in
the world, but they have fun with
their characters.
So does every actor involved.
Joe Lo Truglio ("Paul"), the
nudist winemaker, manages to
make the audience laugh when
they really just should have been
throwing up. Malin Akerman
("The Proposal") churns out
another sexy, short and strange
performance as the ever-desir-
able Eva. But while these char-
acters are cute and naive, they're
underdeveloped. You can laugh
at them, but you can never really
care about them.
And to a certain extent, that's
true of the entire movie. "Wan-
derlust" has no shortage of phal-
lic jokes you'll be quoting for a
week, but its ambitious attempt
to attain hilarity and poignancy
renders the film a bit of both and
a lot of neither. And that's regret-
table, because it's exactly what's
expected.

Right when you thought no
more notable games would come
out for the Wii, Nintendo decided
to surprise us
with "Rhythm
Heaven Fever,"
a deceptively
simple rhythm Rhythm
game with a Heaven Fever
wonderfully
oddball sense Wii
of style. While Nintendo
most rhythm
games these
days are about dancing or pre-
tending to be a rock star with a
fake guitar, "Rhythm Heaven
Fever" takes the concept of a
rhythm game and strips it down
to its bare essentials, making it
purely about timing button press-
es correctly, which it manages to
make really enjoyable.
The controls in "Rhythm
Heaven Fever" could not be sim-
pler: Press the A button. Want
more complexity? Occasionally
you'll have to hit the A and the B
button at the same time. That's it.
There are no other buttons to hit,
no motion control, nothing. In
this sense, anyone could play this
game. Whether they would do
well is an entirely different story.
While it's tempting to think this
would make the game too easy,
"Rhythm Heaven Fever" offers a
surprising amount of variety and
challenge out of such a simple
control scheme.
"Rhythm Heaven Fever" is
essentially a mini-game collec-
tion, but merely labeling it as
such would be doing it a disser-
vice to how original it is. Each
mini-game challenges your sense
of rhythm in a different way,
and each one has an endearingly
quirky and nonsensical premise
to base the challenge on.
For example: In one mini-
game, two dogs are in dogfighter
airplanes playing badminton with
each other. Just go with it. One
dog will hit the shuttlecock to you
and you have to return it at the
right time by pressing A. Sounds
easy enough, but thenthe dog will

Six professors awarded
Thnrnau Professorship

Recipients to
receive $20,000 for
academic programs
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
The University recently
announced six new Arthur F.
Thurnau Professorships, a pres-
tigious title granted to under-
graduate professors who have
shown excellence and innova-
tion in undergraduate teaching.
In addition to carrying the
title before their formal depart-
mental listing, the professorship
also provides each recipient with
$20,000 to attend conferenc-
es, purchase books or procure
equipment for ventures in their
academic fields. The nominees
were unanimously approved
during the University's Board
of Regents meeting in February,
and they will be officially recog-
nized at the University's Honors
Convocation this month.
"This is the favorite thing we
do all year," University Provost
Philip Hanlon said at the meet-
ing. "The Thurnau professor
is t hest honor the Uni-
versity can bestow on its staff
and specifically recognize their
contributions to undergraduate
teaching."
The winners of the profes-
sorships this year hail from a
variety of departments. The six
professors who will now carry
the title are Joseph Bull, associ-
ate professor of biomedical engi-
neering; Michael Haithcock,
professor of music and Director
of University. Bands; Sadashi
Inuzuka, professor of art; Brad-
ford Orr, chair of the Depart-
ment of Physics and professor
of physics; Brian Porter-Szilcs,
professor of history, and Steve
Skerlos, associate professor of
mechanical engineering and
associate professor of civil and
* environmental engineering.

All deans and department
chairs from across the college
are solicited for nominations
for the award, Matthew Kaplan,
managing director of the Uni-
versity's Center for Research on
Learning and Teaching - the
department that coordinates the
collection of selection materi-
als for the professorship said.
The center then forwards those
materials to a rotating commit-
tee of current Thurnau Profes-
sors for review.
"What we're trying to do is
get as big a pool as possible,"
Kaplan said. "(Also) a diverse
pool in terms of faculty back-
ground and identity, discipline,
and school and college."
Kaplan added that the final
selection of professors is deter-
mined by an evaluation on five
main criteria points that include
involvement in teaching, the
professor's innovation and
excellence, and their positive
impact on their students.
"It's always a very difficult
decision because these faculty
who are nominated are the
best faculty at the University,"
Kaplan said.
Usually there are only five
Thurnau Professorships award-
ed, but this year there were
between 20 and 25 nominations
and the committee approved six
awards, Kaplan said.
Porter-Sznlcs said he was
extremely honored to receive
the award, though he suspect-
ed he may be the recipient of
an honor prior to receiving the
accolade.
"The challenge is they have to
collect nominations, and letters
of support for those nomina-
tions," Porter-Szucs said. "The
associate chair of the depart-
ment asked me last December if
I could identify some students
who 'like me,' and who had good
reactions to my teaching and my
classes. I knew something was
up, but I didn't know exactly
what."

He added that the monetary
award that accompanies the pro-
fessorship would also help facili-
tate his writing of a survey course
on the history of modern Poland.
"The most immediate use of
some of the money is a trip to
Poland in this coming summer to
do some research," Porter-Szilcs
said.
Haithcock, meanwhile, cred-
ited his time at Baylor Univer-
sity with helping him hone his
teaching style. He said that
the focus at Baylor was not on
research, though it was certain-
ly encouraged, but rather exem-
plary undergraduate teaching.
"It's important what you say,
but it's more important that
you're listening to what the stu-
dent is takingin," Haithcock said.
Haithcock said one of the
things that has allowed him to
connect with students most is
his time with the University
Symphony Band, which allows
him to foster individual rela-
tionships with students over
multiple semesters.
"I wanted to be a great teach-
er because I respect the value of
education. I think learning is the
most exciting thing you can do,"
Haithcock said. "Whether it's
my 3-year-old granddaughter or
a 35-year-old doctoral student
or an t8-year-old freshman or a
22-year-old senior, I get a great
deal of pleasure watching people
attach themselves to things that
will help them evolve and grow."
Haithcock also said the award
money that accompanies the
professorship will also facilitate
his research and present new
opportunities for students.
"One of the things I want to
do is talk to my current set of
students and see if there is com-
puter or other equipment that
might be good for everybody,"
Haithcock said. "I think there's
some research things I'd like
to do and a couple of important
libraries I'd like to spend some
time at."

Desprez said she supports a
program that encourages stu-

found after her family's mobile
home was destroyed in Friday's
storms. Her father, mother and
two siblings were killed.
When Angel arrived at Kosair
Children's Hospital in Louisville
Friday night, she was opening
her eyes - a hopeful sign, chief
nursing officer Cis Gruebbel said.
Things turned on Saturday,
when the swelling in her brain
didn't decrease, he said. As the
day went on, her eyes ceased to
move and she continued to dete-
riorate. There was no sign of
brain activity.
Medical staff told the family
there wasn't anything more they
could do. With extended fam-
ily gathered to say goodbye, the
family made the decision to end
life support on Sunday.
"Angel has been reunited with
her parents," her grandfather,
Jack Brough, said in a statement.
* "We want to thank God for all of
you and for your thoughts and
prayers. God will bring you and
all of us out of this. This is what
it will take. All should look to
God."
The girl's death brings the
overall toll from Friday's storms
to 39 across five states. Rescuers
were still going door-to-door in
rural areas to rule out more vic-
tims. Another round of storms
earlier last week killed 13 peo-
ple in the Midwest and South,

the latest in a string of severe-
weather episodes ravaging the
American heartland in the past
year.
Yesterday, people gathered to
worship, comb through piles of
debris and learn what happened
to loved ones and friends, often
without modern technology to
help.
Cellphone signals were hard
to find, Internet was out and
electricity indefinitely inter-
rupted. In many cases, word-of-
mouth conversations replaced
text messages, Facebook status
updates and phone calls.
"It's horrible. It's things you
take for granted that aren't there
anymore," said Jack Cleveland,
50, a Census Bureau worker from
Henryville, Ind.
Randy Mattingly, a 24-year-
old mechanic, said he and his
Henryville neighbors passed on
information by word-of-mouth
to make sure people were OK:
"It was like, 'Hey, did you talk to
this guy?"' He said state police
quickly set up two gathering
points for adults and children, at
the church and at a nearby com-
munity center.
At yesterday's mass at St.
Francis Xavier Catholic Church
in Henryville, Father Steve
Schaftlein turned the church
into an information exchange,
asking the 100 or so in atten-
dance to stand up and share
what they knew.
Lisa Smith, who has been
Henryville's postmaster for
six weeks, told people that
they could pick up their mail in
Scottsburg, about 10 miles north.
She said she was most worried
about people needing medica-
tion and she had been shaking
boxes to see if they had pills
inside with hopes of connecting
them to their recipients.
A local insurance agent, Lyn
Murphy-Carter, shared another
story. The founder of her agency,
84-year-old Tom Murphy, had
told her always to keep paper


records. That proved valuable
without access to computers. She
collected about 1,000 claims Sat-
urday alone, and was gathering
handwritten claims from policy-
holders at church.
In West Liberty, Ky., about
85 miles east of Lexington, loss
of technology led to a confus-
ing and stressful aftermath for
Doris Shuck, who was clean-
ing her house when the storm
approached. She grabbed her
laptop, cellphone and iPod and
put them in a tote bag to bring
down to the basement. The
storms took her home, leaving
only the basement and front
porch. Huge piles of debris and
mattresses were strewn in the
back yard.
"I could hear the glass and
hear the wood breaking. I just
thought the house is going to fall
on top of me," she said. She had
scrapes and bruises.
After the storm passed, she
received a text message from her
mother, 70 miles away in Pres-
tonsburg, but couldn't reply.
"I was just trying to figure
out what had happened and get
my thoughts together and my
phone beeped and I looked and
it was from my mom. I couldn't
answer it," Shuck said. She went
to the hospital where she works,
but there was no Internet access
there, either.
She reunited with her hus-
band and daughter at the hospi-
tal and left for Prestonsburg to
let her mother know they were
OK. But they didn't know her
parents were on their way to
West Liberty at the same time.
"We had no way to commu-
nicate that to each other. We're
so used to our cell phones and
instant messaging. We didn't
have any of that."
Her parents asked a state fish
and wildlife officer to go to their
home. The officer eventually
found Doris Shuck's name on
a list at the hospital for people
who were accounted for.

Arbor and surrounding areas by
increasing the number of buses.
She added that students and
faculty will benefit from the new
system as it is more commuter-
friendly.
"(The system benefits) a grad-
uate student doing an internship
at a non-profit based in Ypsilanti
who suddenly has faster service
and more frequent service to that
internship so they can actually
get there without feeling that
they must drive a car," Briere
said. "... A blue bus won't take you
to your home off campus, it will
take you to some stop on North
Campus and then you have to
walk to your off campus resi-
dence. The goal is to make riding
buses a lot easier."

Scott Larsen, a research pro-
fessor of medicinal chemistry
and co-director of the Vahlteich
Medicinal Chemistry Core, and
Hongmin Sun, assistant profes-
sor of medicine at the University
of Missouri. Each professor's
individual lab also contributed
additional researchers.
Larsen said the medicine
could have a vast range of appli-
cations once its commercial-
ized.
"It would work for strep-
tococcus infections including
strep throat in humans," Lars-
en said. "I believe this would
also work for some of the more
serious diseases including
necrotizing fasciitis. And also
potentially it has a veterinary
application for the treatment of
strangles in horses."
Ginsburg stressed the impor-
tance of finding an alternative
treatment method to antibiotics
for infections.
"Antibiotic resistance is
becoming an enormous problem
now since we use antibiotics so
much," Ginsburg said. "Many
of the infections we commonly
treat are very resistant to most
antibiotics. Some are even resis-
tant to all known antibiotics.
We are running out of antibiot-
ics we can use."
Ginsburg's claims are sup-
ported by the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention, which
states that antibiotic resistance
in the United States has resulted
in more than $20 billion a year
in extra medical and hospital-
ization costs and $35 million of
other costs to society.
Rackham student Bryan
Yestrepsky, a graduate student
researcher working on the proj-
ect with Larsen, agreed that
drug-resistant bacteria are a
growing threat to the overall

probable route for implementing
medical amnesty than changing
University policy since college-
level policies cannot be in "dis-
agreement with state law," she
said.
LSA junior Sebastian Swae-
Shampine, assistant executive
director of the University's
chapter of Students for Sensi-
ble Drug Policy, attended mul-
tiple CSG assembly meetings
to speak in support of medi-
cal amnesty. Swae-Shampine
said most opponents of medical
amnesty believe it will foster an
atmosphere of over-consump-
tion without penalties, but he
said that is not the case.
"This is a harm-reduction
policy," he said. "If it's crafted
well, that's what it will do. It's
not meant to be condoning any
sort of excessive or risk-taking
behavior."
He added that there are
other punishments that come
with overconsumption, regard-
less of whether or not a student
receives an MIP.
"They're still going to wake
up in a hospital room, not a
ticket in their right hand, but an
IV in their left and ... a bill for
said she rides the AATA buses
often, and the increased stops
would be beneficial.
"I think it will be really help-
ful especially in the winter when
I don't want to walk a lot," Gra-
ham said.
Councilmember Mike Anglin
(D-Ward 5) said that while he
agrees with the mass transit
plan, he believes other measures
should be implemented first.
"We have a great bus service
now, but we need to make it so
there are more stops," Anglin
said. "When we make it easier
to use the buses here in town
we will start to have the reputa-
tion of having a really good bus
system and other jurisdictions
will see the opportunity to get
involved (in a mass transit sys-
tem)."
Anglin said he also worries
that the other members of the
four-party agreement - Ypsilan-
welfare of the public as tradi-
tional antibiotics become less
effective through evolved resis-
tance.
"It is becoming increasingly
important that we think of new
strategies to combat them,"
Yestrepsky said. "If we can
make a compound that breaks
the cycle of treatment leading to
resistance, it would change the
landscape of the antibiotic field
entirely."
Ginsburg also said current
antibiotics that are on the mar-
ket work to kill the bacteria,
though out of the billions of
bacteria, a small number will
inevitably survive due to their
unique genetic makeups. Later,
these bacteria will replicate
repeatedly and result in a whole
new population where each and
every bacterium is resistant to
the drug, Ginsburg said.
"With what we are doing,
we are not actually killing the
bacteria, we are just forcing the
bacteria to stop making this one
gene that it needs for infection"
Ginsburg said. "The bacteria are

still growing and they're fine,
but they're not able to make you
sick anymore."
According to Ginsburg, the
general idea for the project was
generated 10 years ago when
Sun was still a postdoctoral
trainee working in his lab. How-
ever, most of the actual research
and experimentation began five
years ago.
An essential part of the
project involved an intensive
screening of chemical com-
pounds that consisted of more
than 50,000 biochemical tests,
Ginsburg added.
"Sun grew bacteria in hun-
dreds and hundreds of little
wells," Ginsburg said. "In each
well you would put a different
chemical and then we would
look for the chemicals that did
what we wanted to the bacte-
ria's genes."

an ambulance ride, a bill for a
hospital stay," Swae-Shampine
said. "It's not a free pass, there
are still sanctions."
If medical amnesty is imple
mented at the University, both
Sathi and Swae-Shampine said
they would support expanding
it to cover other drugs-related
incidents.
"There are a lot of scary drugs
outthere,"Swae-Shampine said
"A lot of drugs that can do some
serious harm in overdose or
overconsumption situations -
alcohol probably being the most
present or prolific, especially on
a college campus."
Sathi said discussion about
medical amnesty could be diffi-
cult because many people don't
want to talk about it.
"It's a touchy subject and no
one wants to talk about drugs
and alcohol," he said.
However, Swae-Shampine
said promoting these conversa-
tions and increasing transpar-
ency is imperative to solving
these issues.
"We've got to have that just
upfront discussion and that can-
dor which I find - at least in the
political realm - lacking."
ti, Washtenaw County and AATA
- will not pay their dues, causing
the city of Ann Arbor to pay more
than their share.
Specifically, he said he fears
that Ypsilanti residents will not
approve the tax increases that
would help pay for the masstran-
sit system since other taxes have
been implemented recently.
"The taxpayers of Ypsilanti
are going to be asked to approve
additional taxes upon themselves
at a time when it is very difficult
as a tax payer to approve taxes,"
Anglin said. "I think it's a good
idea to have mass transit, but I
don't think the people are going
to want to pay for it. People are
very reliant on their automobiles
here."
Anglin added: "We have built
a tremendous amount of infra-
structure, we have put a lot into
the system and now it is the time
to get the returns from it."
Larsen said currently the
newer, more potent compounds
they have tested on animals
are not as effective as the lead
compound, probably due to high
metabolism rates.
"We still have a lot of work to
do," Larsen said. "The biggest
challenge we have had is improv-
ing the potency while maintain-
ing good stability to metabolism
by liver enzymes, which results
in rapid clearance from the body.
In addition, we are still conduct-
ing tests to determine the molec-
ular targets of the compounds in
the bacteria."
Larsen also said he believes
the collaboration has been very
meaningful and all three head
researchers have contributed
their strengths to the project's
development.
"It's been great working with
Dr. Ginsburg, who is an expert
on the blood coagulation pro-
cess which is the mechanism by
which strep infection spreads

and the compounds work,"
Larsen said. "And although Dr.
Sun is now located at a distant
university, the science is so
exciting that we've kept the col-
laboration going."
On Feb. 13, the research team
published their findings in a
paper in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences of
the United States of America - a
biweekly science journal.
Engineering freshman
Anuraag Veturi said he sees
the discovery of the new corm
pound as a huge leap in medical
advancement.
"If such a drug can be com-
mercialized, it would defiiitely
solve a lot of the dangers asso-
ciated with taking high doses of
antibiotics in an attempt to heal
faster," Veturi said. "I think the
researchers have come up with a
very innovative idea that might
just change the medicine indus-
try and how we perceive antibi-
otics."

Before the season, few ana-
lysts predicted that Michigan
would vie for a title by season's
end, and after the Wolverines
suffered their first home loss
of the season on senior night to
Purdue last weekend, the pro-
jections seemed accurate. Ohio
State fell on its senior night that
weekend as well, and all Michi-
gan State had to do to wrap up
the outright title was win one of
its last two matchups.
But in an unlikely twist,
Indiana denied the Spartans in
Bloomington on Tuesday, 70-55,
and Buford took care of the rest
on Sunday.
"The most rewarding part of
what just happened is watching

said after Ohio State took care of
business.
"When you (are a) coach for
this long, and our staff knows
this, it's not about the Ws, it's
about the journey. ... It's cer-
tainly a highlight in this year's
journey, and for some guys, a
four-year journey."
Despite the slip-up against
the Boilermakers last week, the
Wolverines will enter the Big
Ten Tournament in Indianapo-
lis this weekend on a roll, having
won six of their last seven con-
tests.

the right breaks go our way, (to
win) a share of the Big Ten Cham-
pionship, which is something
that's very important at the Uni-
versity of Michigan."
The Wolverines have to feel
lucky they were even in that posi-
tion, after nearly blowing a lead
that reached 19 points in the sec-
ond half. The Nittany Lions made
a desperate charge on their senior
day, capitalizing on Michigan's
sloppiness to go on a late 13-0 run,
and nearly erasing the deficit in
the process.
Freshman point guard Trey
Burke, who led his team with 19
points, seemed to regain control

for Michigan (13-5 Big Ten, 23-8
overall) with a four-point play to
push the lead back to 10 points
with 4:39 left, but Penn State
(4-14, 12-19) answered with a
four-point play of its own, courte-
sy of Trey Lewis. Jermaine Mar-
shall, who spurred the Nittany
Lion surge and finished with 27
points to lead all scorers, made a
jumper with 2:38 left and cut the
score to 62-58.
"When you go up by 20 with
about 10 minutes to go, that's a
tough position to be in, because
you're not going to be as aggres-
sive on offense," said senior guard
Zack Novak. "You want to run

some clock and they're going to
turn it up aggressively.... I'm just
proud of the way we fought back
after they cut it down."
But Penn State would get no
closer. Sophomore guard Tim
Hardaway Jr. hit a short jumper
near the left elbow to extend the
lead back to six points with 41
seconds left and then grabbed the
rebound when Marshall missed
the next time down the floor.
The Wolverines made enough
free throws to seal the game from
there.
It's somewhat shocking the
game got as close as it did. Penn
State started out hot on Sunday,

making its first three 3-pointers
and leading the rebounding bat-
tle, 9-2, by the first media timeout
of the game. But Michigan quick-
ly responded and took control of
the game, as a Hardaway 3-point-
er with 10:37 left in the first half
erased the last lead the Nittany
Lions would have.
Following his 25-point,
11-rebound performance at Illi-
nois on Thursday, Hardaway con-
tinued to show signs that he had
broken out of his slump. Against
Penn State, he made three of his
first four attempts from deep and
finished with 13 points on the day.

Buckeyes bounce 'in tourney

By LIZ NAGLE
Daily Sports Writer
WEST LAFAYETTE - "Two."
The sound of a takedown and
the referee's ensuing call for
points rumbled through Mackey
Arena this weekend. The bleach-
ers weren't filled with their usual
Boilermakers' basketball fan base,
instead, they were segregated into
12 rival sections, each representing
a school in the conference.
After a long season of dual meets,
the Michigan wrestling team came
to Purdue to repeat its victories and
avenge its losses.
Every match mattered in the
Big Ten Tournament, with teams
vying to earn a spot in the upcom-
ing NCAA Championships. And
again, fifth-year senior Kellen Rus-
sell climbed to the top to claim his
fourth conference title in as many
years (2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012).
In doing so, he became the first
Wolverine to accomplish the feat
and just the 11th wrestler in Big Ten
history.
But on Saturday, Michigan did
not get off to a great start. By the
end of the first day, four Wolver-
ines had already been eliminated,

and the team accumulated just 50
points for an eighth-place start.
"Guys just didn't wrestle up
to their potential," Russell said.
"It wasn't a lack of trying.... They
weren't wrestling a full seven min-
utes."
Fifth-year senior Justin Zeerip
and redshirt freshman Max Hunt-
ley were No. 4 seeds entering the
tournament, but both fell in minor
quarterfinal upsets to fifth seeds
after first-round byes.
Zeerip's foe was a familiar one:
Ohio State's Nick Heflin. Zeerip,
ranked eighth, squared off against
the No.10 Buckeyetin the 174-pound
contest exactly one month ago. In
February, he fell in the second tie-
breaker as a result of the referee's
waiver on the original reversal call.
Mackey Arena played host to
yet another close match between
the border-state rivals. Heflin stole
another win, leaving Zeerip to
wrestle in the consolation bracket,
where he placed seventh.
Redshirt sophomore Eric Gra-
jales, too, came to prove he right-
fully deserved his previous wins
and to take revenge on his former
losses in the 149-pound category.

half effort, extended its three-

as 16 early in the second half.
But the Wolverines weren't
ready to let the game slip out of
their hands.
Michigan (20-11, 8-8) went
on a 10-0 run - capped by
freshman guard Brenae Harris'
first collegiate 3-pointer - forc-

out. Just like that, Ohio State's
16-point lead was cut to six in
just three minutes.
The teams traded buckets,
but four free throws by Hill and
senior Samantha Prahalis with
just under a minute left iced the
game. The Buckeyes defeated
Michigan in season-low scoring
efforts by both teams, 57-48.
The game was headlined by

both teams' defenses: The Wol-
verines held the league-leading
scoring duo of Prahalis and Hill
to just 30 points - 11 points shy
of their combined season aver-

A toast to (one of) the Big Ten champions

BUFFALO WILD WINGS -
Armed with vitality
and courage to burn,
middle-aged man slowly
lifted his amber ale.
"Cheers," he began.
His voice dripped with brazen
confidence,
rising above
the clamor
to silence
the table.
His com-
rades turned
toward thei
head of the STEPHEN J.
table and S
reached for NESBITT
their glasses.
"Cheers to
Michigan - we're Big Ten cham-
pions," he said.
The man could have been an
entrepreneur. He could have
been a professor. He could have
been a doctor. But tonight, he
was a Michigan basketball fan,
dressed in his maize hoodie with
"Michigan" splashed across the
chest with boldness that matched
his voice.
The confidence had been
brewing since an early-season
upset against then-No. 8 Mem-
phis at the Maui Invitational. It
bubbled over on Sunday evening.
Earlier in the afternoon, with
one step-back dagger from Ohio
State's William Buford in East
Lansing, Michigan catapulted
alongside the Spartans and Buck-
eyes for a three-way share of the
Big Ten regular-season title -
the Wolverines' first conference
championship since 1986.
Had Ohio State not knocked

track record speaks for itself.
A Big Ten Championship
shouldn't have come so soon. He
lost his touted guard in Morris
and opened the year starting a
senior, three sophomores and a
freshman.
That's not a lineup that would
be expected to contend for a
championship in the toughest
conference in the game of college
basketball.
Beilein is a teacher at heart.
And he's an educator that knows
his trade down to an expert level.
He's taken two Michigan teams
into the second round of the
NCAA Tournament, what's to say
he can't do more this time?
Back at Buffalo Wild Wings, a
trio of students plunked down at
a table beside the toastingtroupe.
It wasn't clear, but an educated
guess pegged them as engineers.
"We needed Ohio to beat
Michigan State," one of them
commented, carefully eschewing
the name Ohio State. As filthy as
it felt, Michigan fans were left to
root for a Buckeye win on Sun-
day - or a Michigan State loss, as
some said.
Buford's game-winner was a
thrill, and he was a savior. Then,
cheering just felt wrong.
But it was for the good of
Michigan. A whirlwind Sunday
ended in the best possible way. It
ended in a toast.
So here's to Michigan. Here's
to the champions.
Thanks for making believers
of us all.

ALDEN REISS/Daily
Freshman guard Trey Burke has filled in at point guard as a true freshman for Michigan, averaging 14.5 points and 4.8 assists per game during the regular season.

off the first-place Spartans at the
Breslin Center on Sunday, there
never would have been a three-
way split for the championship.
There never would have been a
toast at Buffalo Wild Wings.
I imagine our friend would
have found himself back at the
corner of State and Washington
anyway, but he would have found
a corner stool at the bar. With his
saturnine face and watchful eyes,
he would have been left alone.
But Buford drilled it. Electri-
fied, the man clambered out of
his stupor to extol the Wolver-
ines. He, too, felt like he was - at
long last - a champion.
So he toasted to Michigan. You

should too. Lift the glass, I'll lead
the way.
Here's toyou, Trey Burke.
Without Burke patrolling the
point, Michigan would have been
nowhere near contention for the
conference championship.
To merely say there was pres-
sure on the guard would be an
injustice. Burke was tasked with
running Michigan coach John
Beilein's complex offense as a
true freshman - and he'd be
filling in for star Darius Morris,
who bolted for the NBA follow-
ing his sophomore season.
Instead of folding, Burke
proved his mettle. Averaging 14.5
points and 4.8 assists, his statis-

tics sit a small step behind last
season's Morris (15.0 points, 6.7
assists). But he's a floor general
that fits for Michigan.
Here's to you, Zack Novak and
Stu Douglass.
This duo won't soon be forgot-
ten. They might have penned the
screenplay for True Grit. (Sorry,
Joel and Ethan Coen.)
Overlooked and under the
radar, Novak and Douglass
found their way to Ann Arbor
and worked to win the hearts of
Michigan fans. Despite being a
program under construction in
a state painted green by power-
house Michigan State, Novak and
Douglass trumpeted the values

of Beilein's curriculum on and off
the court.
The senior captains' final reg-
ular season could be justly billed
as justified.
The pair of Indiana natives
who were passed over by home-
town schools fought tooth and
nail to bring Michigan basketball
back to Crisler Center.
And Michigan basketball,
headlined by its two captains,
finished 15-1 at home.
Here's toyou, John Beilein.
Beilein commands attention.
He's not as boisterous, dynamic
or memorable as many coaches
across the nation, but few can
stand toe-to-toe with him. His

Lacrosse earns program's first victor m BPae

By KYLE SAUKAS
For the Daily
The Michigan men's lacrosse
team made history Sunday morn-
ing in Florida. With a victory over
Mercer, the team earned its first
win in the program's young his-
tory. The Wolverines, in their
premier season of Division-I play,
crushed the Bears, 14-4.
Michigan came off a disap-
pointing loss against Jacksonville
on Friday, when the Dolphins
scored an overtime goal to take
the game, 9-8. With a single day
to recover, the Wolverines got
down to business in preparation
for Mercer. Michigan coach John
Paul did not allow the loss to dis-
tract his team from the task ahead
and was rewarded with the first
win of the season.
"It is a very quick turnaround,"
Paul said. "They have had all
week to prepare for us and we
have had a day."
The game started off in Michi-
gan's favor, as the team scored
four goals in the first period.
Mercer closed the deficit to five
in the third quarter, but that was
as close as the Bears would get.
A four-goal Wolverine run in the
fourth ended any thoughts of a
comeback and gave Michigan a
decisive 10-pointnvictory.
With little time to study its
opponent, the team knew it could
not be tentative against Mercer
and decided to take its new man-
tra - aggressiveness - to heart
and to the field. After its impres-
sive performance in the first
quarter, the team left little doubt
as to who would be the victors in
BOUNCED

so in order to make the most of
that matchup, Sheffer had to play
more on the perimeter. Six of her
eight points came from beyond
the arc.
"I think we just tried to spread
the floor and go at her as much as
we could," Sheffer said of Adams.
"At 6-foot-5, she's a big girl. It's
hard to get in the paint and go
around her, especially at (my)
size, but we just tried to go at her
around the arc."
Senior guards Carmen Reyn-
olds and Courtney Boylan led the
Wolverine offense with 14 and 10
points, respectively, while junior
guard Jenny Ryan stepped up
in her habitual role on defense.
Ryan had a team-high eight
rebounds and five steals while
guarding Prahalis for a signifi-

the last game of spring break.
"We are a little relieved, to say
the least," Paul said. "We need to
continue to build this program,
and (Sunday) was an important
step on that path."
Junior midfielder Thomas
Paras led all scorers with four
goals and two assists in the vic-
tory over the Bears.
"The four goals ... is something
I take a lot of pride in as a cap-
tain," Paras said. "Everyone on
the team stepped up today. We
played with a lot of passion and
aggression.
"That's just our style of play."
Paras' performance was a key
part of the Wolverines' success,
and Paul commended his player,
whose role on the team changed
significantly from last year.
"(Thomas) is an incredibly tal-
ented athlete and very talented
cant portion of the second half.
Boylan knew the defense
would need to have a strong
showing to shut down Ohio
State's league-leading offense,
but she thought the game was
decided by multiple missed
chances to close the gap down
the stretch.
"I felt we had some good
opportunities around (the four-
minute mark to make shots),"
Boylan said. "I believe we were
down like six (or) seven points.
And I had a couple of opportuni-
ties to make some free throws.
Some of us had some good, open
shots, but just didn't seem to
knock them down at the time."
Michigan didn't improve on
shooting between halves, going
19-of-55 for the game. Shef-
fer and Boylan, the Wolverines'
leading scorers, went a com-
bined 1-for-6 in the first half,
and Boylan uncharacteristically

lacrosse player," Paul said. "We
moved him this year from attack
to midfield. It's been a little bit of
a change for him. He is starting to
understand what his role is in the
system."
Fifth-year senior attackman
Trevor Yealy and sophomore mid-
fielder Doug Bryant each added
three goals. Junior midfielder
Willie Steenland had one goal
and three assists in the victory, as
well. Their performances helped
the Wolverines to their highest
scoring game of the season.
The players attribute their
high-scoring featto their focus on
being aggressive.
"(Michigan assistant) Coach
(Keith) Euker sat the attack down
and told us that we were not being
aggressive enough in all facets
of the game," Yealy said. "(The
increase in offense was) a com-
missed two free throws, which
would've cut the lead to seven.
Michigan didn't shoot partic-
ularly well from beyond the arc,
either.
The squad shot an abysmal
1-for-11 in the first half and was
forced to take more attempts in
the second half just to try to cut
the deficit.
"I think maybe the shot selec-
tion we took in the first half
potentially could have some-
thing to do with (the loss)," said
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth.
"But you have to feel it. We tried
to get down inside that lane, but
they kept challenging us from
the arc.
"We had some good looks
down low.... We tried a few back-
door cuts, when we went after
it with one hand instead of two
hands, got deflected, went out
of bounds. We tried to get it in
there. and the ball iust wasn't

bination of being more aggres-
sive, finding open looks, and guys
being able to see ... those open
looks."
Another important aspect of
the victory over the Bears was the
play of fifth-year senior faceoff
man Brian Greiner. Greiner was
hailed by his coaches for having
an exceptional performance in
the faceoff position against Mer-
cer. Faceoffs have been a weak-
ness of the Wolverines and were
a main cause of their downfall
against Jacksonville on Friday.
On Sunday, though, Greiner
helped Michigan win 15 of 20
faceoffs.
"I knew I needed to do my part
to help out and get possessions for
us," Greiner said. "Personally, it's
my only job, so it's a lot of work,
and I take it very seriously. It's a
team effort. It's my wingers help-
ing me outgetting ground balls."
In the win, Michigan also
allowed its fewest goals all sea-
son. Freshman goalie Emil Weiss,
who returned after a hand injury,
was a major contributor for the
Wolverines over the weekend.
Weiss played in exhibition
matches earlier this year, but
played his first Division-I college
game against Jacksonville. In his
debut performance, Weiss had
fifteen saves against the Dolphins
and added another four against
Mercer. With a new mindset on
offense and a replenished defense,
Michigan made a splash in Flor-
ida over spring break. The team
is looking forward to its game on
Wednesday against Loyola in Ann
Arbor, its first home game of the
season.
going our way in the first half.
And as a result, you line up with
3-point shots that don't go in. If
they go in, it's a different conver-
sation."
Now that the Wolverines' Big
Ten Tournament run is over,
they have just over a week until
Selection Monday, when they
find out if they've earned their
first tournament bid since 2001.
Borseth thinks the team has
earned it despite going one-and-
done in the conference tourna-
ment.
"We put 20 wins on theboard,"
Borseth said. "We finished .500
in our conference. Our RPI is
good. We had a great strength of
schedule.
"We're a very strong team. We
feel we've laid our case, but at
this point it's unfortunately not
in our hands, it's in their hands.
So we have to have a kind of wait-
and-see scenario right now."
f

His "FIGHT LIKE HELL"
T-shirt said it all. But in the semi-
finals, Grajales fell to Minnesota's
Dylan Ness, who he defeated in a
5-3 decision earlier this season.
Then on Sunday, in his first
consolation match, Grajales faced
Ohio State's Cam Tessari en route
to his third-place finish. Though
Grajales shut out the Buckeye in
last month's duel, it was not as
easy this time around. At the end
of the third period, the score was
tied 2-2 and went into sudden vic-
tory. Finally, in the fourth round
of tiebreakers, Michigan coach
Joe McFarland and assistant
coach Sean Bormet anxiously rose
from their chairs while Grajales
made a one-point escape for the
win. His 15-minute marathon was
the longest tussle in Michigan his-
tory since the most recent over-
time system was implemented.
When the referee raised Gra-
jales' arm to signify his victory,
he flexed in front of a rowdy Buck-
eye crowd. A wrestler of similar
strength but mellower spirits fol-
lowed. Russell calmly paced back
and forth before his champion-
ship match began. But he always
remains composed, almost stoic.
Then, Russell took the mat
and let out his aggression. Iowa's
Montell Marion was the unlucky
candidate and stepping-stone to
Russell inking his name in the
history books. The senior imme-
diately took hold of Marion's leg
and tried to keep him in bounds,
pulling him toward the center. He
went for a takedown, scoring in
the first 30 seconds of action.
In the 195th bout of the week-
end, Russell clinched his win with
PENN STATE
From Page 1B
"He's progressing every sin-
gle day," said senior guard Stu
Douglass. "He had that turnover
toward the end of the game, then
he came back and hit that big
shot. It didn't faze him. ... He's
not letting his offense dictate the
rest of his game, which is good."
That 3-pointer began a 23-5
run for the Wolverines, who
clamped down on defense.
With Hardaway Jr. and Burke
out of the game, Michigan
went to a trapping 2-3 zone and
promptly forced two turnovers,
each punctuated by abasket from
Douglass.
Michigan also got a key con-
tribution from sophomore for-
ward Evan Smotrycz, who led all
scorers with 12 points in the first
half and had a couple key baskets

a single-leg akedown in the last
second of the match. He reacted
with humility and joined his par-
ents in the stands before being
called to the podium. Interest-
ingly, Ed and Maria Russell did
not wear maize and blue. Instead,
they wore white T-shirts with
lightning bolts on the backs to
replicate their son's tattoo on his
thigh.
Some may think that it repre-
sents Russell's quick attacks or
his storm-force approach, but it's
really just a sign of his past. In the
1970s, the wrestlers at Blair Acad-
emy, Russell's high school in New
Jersey, tattooed the symbol on
their legs despite their Buccaneer
mascot. And it's tradition itself
that Russell creates. He became
the first grappler since Iowa's
Mark Ironside to record four Big
Ten titles. He was later named
this year's co-Most Outstanding
Wrestler of the Championships,
alongside Penn State's Frank
Molinaro.
Assistant coach Donny Prit-
zlaff described Russell as the
hardest working and most consis-
tent Wolverine. But he wasn't as
satisfied with the seventh-place
team finish. No. 14 senior Zac
Stevens proved Pritzlaff right
and wrong. He pinned his two
unranked opponents, but fell to
Illinois' No. 4 B.J. Futrell twice
in the tournament. But en route to
his fourth-place finish, the high-
est of his career, Stevens won a
3-2 upset over Purdue's eighth-
ranked Cashd Quiroga.
"Gotta hold your head up high,"
Stevens said. "I wrestled as hard
as I could."
Though Michigan sought more
than it achieved, it ended as a
weekend of upsets, rivalry and
Russell - a crowned champion.
after the break. Smotrycz's driv-
ing layup with 14:42 left in the
game put the Wolverines back
up by 16 points, and his 3-pointer
two minutes later gave his team
its largest lead of the day at 54-35.
That's when the Nittany
Lions made their run. Though
star guard Tim Frazier shot just
4-for-16 on the afternoon, Mar-
shall was there for key baskets.
But Michigan had enough poise
to stay on top.
Upon returning to Ann Arbor,
the Wolverines found out their
reward for doing so.
"You do go into it (knowingthe
stakes), and we talked a lot about
it - this is what champions do on
this day," Beilein said. "They play
with poise, they play with confi-
dence, they do the little things.
"We certainly weren't perfect
today, but we did a lot of things
we needed to do to win this
game."

MHSAA State Championship.
Luke played on a torn MCL for
the last five weeks of the state title
run. Instead of practicing on the
field with his teammates, the full-
back was in the training room or
i rehabbingin the swimmingpool.
"And then on Saturday, he'd
rip off 140 yards on 15 carries and
bash over linebackers for Kelvin,"
Stuursma said. "We'd put him on a
bike between downs and series if
we could rest him.
"He said if he just keeps his legs
moving, it didn't hurt, but once he
stopped, it'd hurt. So he kept mov-
ing and we kept playing him and
he never quit."
In the state final at Ford Field in
Detroit, East Grand Rapids rum-
bled past Farmington Hills Har-
rison for a 42-17 victory. Kelvin
scampered for 209 yards and two
touchdowns. Running on one leg,
Luke barreled his way for 98 yards
and a pair of touchdowns.
"He's the type that would run
through a wall to be the best," Kel-
vin said.
Stuursma doesn't remember
the state-final victory quite as
well anymore. Instead, he quick-
ly brings up a matchup against
Grand Rapids Catholic Central
during Luke's junior season.
To him, it illustrates everything
you need to know about Luke.
East Grand Rapids lined up at
its own 15-yard line and put the
running backs to work.
"Kelvin was ripping of six-,
eight-, 10-, 15-yard gainers here
and there, then we'd give it to Luke
* and he'd get a tough yard or two,"
Stuursma said.
With the ball lined up at the
Catholic Central one-yard line,
Stuursma sent his play call into
the huddle. It was a fullback dive.
Luke looked across the huddle at
Kelvin, stared down at the dirt
and shook his head. Luke took the
handoff and scored.
He came off to the Pioneers
sideline and went straight to Stu-
ursma. Both coach and player
remember the incident, nearly
sevenyears later.
"We got in a little scuffle
because I came off and said 'Hey,
give it to Kelvin next time,' " Luke
said.
"I got in his kitchen a little bit
about it, saying, 'Listen, you play,
I'll coach,' " Stuursma added.
"He freaked out, and rightfully
so," Luke said, smiling at the mem-
ory. "I was a 16-year-old kid telling
him what to do.
"I just felt bad. Kelvin just did
everything. I blocked a few guys,
sure, but he seriously took the ball
85 yards and then I get one yard
for the touchdown."
Stuursma says he's never seen
a player with as much heart and
conviction on and offthe field than
Luke.
"From that point on, it became
more than a coach-player relation-
ship, but more of a friendship,"
Stuursma said.
A yellowingnewspaper clipping
4 tells the story of a fourth-string
fullback who emerged as team
captain as a junior. The excerpt,
clipped from the Toledo Blade, is
dated Aug.31,1981.

The accompanying photo shows
Tom Glendening, a shaggy-haired
fullback from western Michigan
who won a spot on the Bowling
Green football team.
He's called a maverick, a win-
ner, a captain.
Tom's journey wasn't so differ-
ent from Luke's. The difference,
though, is that nobody wanted
Tom's kid.
As his senior year came to a
close, Luke held football walk-on
offers from Wheaton and Hope,
two Division-III Christian col-
leges. But Luke didn't want to play
football. Hockey was his passion -
it just wasn't his strong suit.
His backers knew Luke's work
ethic and humilitywould land him
somewhere, they just didn't know
where.
"I knew what he was worth,"
Kelvin said. "I knew that he could
play at any school in the country,
football or hockey, just because I'd
been around him. He told me he
was willing to go wherever would
take him - he just wanted to play.
"People don't know this about
him, but while Luke is a great
hockey player, he could've easily
come to Michigan and played foot-
ball here."

there," Luke said.
Luke had quicklyearned Beren-
son's trust. The walk-on who was
never promised ice time suited up
for the second scrimmage.
The morning after Luke
watched Michigan's first scrim-
mage, the Glendenings were just
sitting down for the morning ser-
vice at Crossroads Bible Church in
Grand Rapids when Luke called
Tom. He was in the lineup.
"When I heard that, I thought
'I must have misunderstood what
this whole Michigan thing was,'
".Joe said. "I didn't think he'd get
into the lineup until they were bat-
tling injury midseason or some-
thing."
The family dashed out of church
and sped through the three-hour
trip to Ann Arbor to make the 4:05

The reason. Powers visited
Hotchkiss in the first place had
nothing to do with Luke. He was
there to see one of Luke's team-
mates - defenseman Mac Bennett.
Luke didn't know who Powers
was or that the coach was even at
the holidaytournament. But in the
finals, Luke scored both of Hotch-
kiss's goals against rival Deerfield
- it was impeccablectiming fortwo
of his eightcgoals all season.
Powers came away impressed.
"Guess who was at my game
today?" Luke asked his parents in
a postgame phone call. "Coach told
me I picked agood dayto playwell,
because Michigan was here. They
maybe interested in taking me as a
preferred walk-on."
It wasn't a phone call they ever
expected. It wasn't the kind of call
they'd been hearing from their
son. Luke had been struggling
with homesickness at Hotchkiss,
with his family 700 miles away.
In the late fall, Tom and Les-
lie determined that it would be 31
days until Luke would see them,
when Hotchkiss closed for Christ-
mas break. They told Luke to start
reading 1 Samuel, the ninth book
of the Old Testament. It had 31
chapters. Read one chapter every
night, they said, then they would
talk about it on the phone.
That was the kind of call they
were expecting. Instead, Michi-
gan - the premier program in col-
lege hockey - was in the picture.
Itwasstill early, but Powers was
serious about this one. It wasn't
the goal-scoring ability that stood
out, it was the shift-to-shift men-
tality, the aggressiveness.
"He has the explosion of a run-
ning back," Powers said. "Luke
really explodes, and there's great
power in his stride. His physical-
ity, the way he hits, he uses his full
bodylike in football.
"You're just not going to see
Luke Glendening get knocked
down, I don't care howbigthe guy
is."
Bennett committed to Michi-
gan during the season, but it was
him who was taking pointers from
Luke, the walk-on hopeful.
"I cannot say enough good
things about Luke Glendening,"
Bennett said. "That kid is a stud in
every way. Off the ice, he's some-
one that I tryto model myself after
- he does everything right. He
puts in the effort, doesn't take any
shortcuts. Maybe it's that western-
Michigan mindset or something,
but he just puts in the work."
"At Hotchkiss, the biggest
guys on the other team - let's say
6-foot-3 and 220 pounds - would
try to step up and destroy Luke.
And Luke's just built like a brick
house. People would try to hit him
and they'd bounce off."
The Hotchkiss season fin-
ished in late February. It wasn't
until April that Powers finally
gave Glendening a call. Fresh-
man standout Max Pacioretty was
signing a professional contract
and leaving school. Michigan had
a spot for Luke.
Stuursma picked up his tempo
to keep up with Luke. Gravel
crackled underfoot as the former

"They told meI underestimated
Luke Glendening," Powers said.
"And I did."
Even then, the Glendenings
didn't really understand Luke's
position on the team.
"I'm thinking a preferred walk-
on means there are 60 freshmen
trying for two positions," Tom
said, giving a chuckle. "He called
us when he got there and said, 'No,

on the final seat. The placard in
front of the empty seat read Luke
Glendening.
The veteran coach gave a small
smile and turned back. If he were
to pick any single player to rep-
resent the Michigan program, it
would be his junior captain - he'd
never seen the kid stop fighting.
"It seems like a lot of the young-
er generation, they feel entitled
and not as willing to work," Beren-
son said. "But I tell you what, the
kid (who was) sitting at the end of
the table here, Luke Glendening,
he came to Michigan like (senior
goaltender) Shawn Hunwick -
with no expectations.
"I didn't know if he would ever
play a game, and when I saw him
on the ice, I realized that this kid
has something special. ... He goes
through the wall. Off the ice, he
is like a machine, and he is just a
great kid. Those are the kind of
kids that set an example for those
entitled kids."
At the time, he was splitting
a scholarship with goaltender
Shawn Hunwick - the captain
and the star goalie, former walk-
ons who were thought destined for
inglorious careers as reserves.
Powers said the one-year tryout
turned into four years after just a
week or two. Back in 2008, Luke
wasn't so confident.
"I didn't feel comfortable until
we had a meeting at the end of the
year," Luke said. "They finally told
me I'd be on the team next year.
That'sthe way Iam, maybe I doubt
a lot - I don't think I do - but I
needed to hear it from them."
A year later, immediately fol-
lowing Luke's sophomore season,
the team voted on captains for the
following year - the consensus
was to elect Hagelin and Glenden-
ing. It was an easy decision.
"If you don't make Luke captain,
then you've got serious problems
on your team," Bennett said. "A
captain is supposed to be a leader,
someone who shows the younger
players the right things to do and
how to do it. Luke is thatguy."
No one batted an eyelash. He
wasn't a goal scorer. He wasn't
fancy. He was a walk-on. So how
did he do it?
"Teammates aren't worried
about the scholarship or the goals
or assists," Berenson said. "They
want a person they can trust, who

they can look up to and respect off
the ice, away from the rink when
no one else is looking.
"I think he was a slam-dunk for
captain."
A script tattoo runs along Luke's
right bicep. The dark lettering
bears the reference to his favorite
verse: Colossians 3:23. It's why he
chose No.23 for hisjersey number.
"Whatever you do, work at it
with all your heart, as working for
the Lord, not for human masters,"
the verse reads.
Luke's story is hard to believe.
His underdog journey hasn't fol-
lowed a script. It hasn't been a
path paved by entitlement, but
rather one gutted by struggles and
decisions. It'sthe story of a captain
who was overlooked time andtime
again. It wasn't his goal-scoring
that kept him on the Michigan
hockey team for four seasons -
he's scored 29 times in 158 games.
(His family jokes that half of those
were empty-netters, too.)
It washis character - character
built by family, faith and football.
For Berenson, it was this:
"The bottom line is that this kid
is a solid person," Berenson said.
"If you take everything else away,
he knows right from wrong, and
he's not afraid to back it up."
For Stuursma, it was this:
"We might need an hour (to
interview), because he's an unbe-
lievable kid," the football coach
said. "I trust him with my life."
And for his father, it was this:
"What makes me the proudest
is that he'll take a homeless guy
and buy him something to eat,"
Tom said. "Or he'll take a little kid
and wrap his arms around him and
love him at hockey camp. I'm a lot
more proud that he does that than
he scored a goal or is captain."
Luke may only have a handful
of games remaining in his hockey
career. He was never drafted,
though he might test the minor-
league waters. If that doesn't lead
anywhere, he wants to be a teach-
er and a coach.
Michigan's captain doesn't fit
the mold of a typical student-ath-
lete. But, then again, he never did.
Michigan promised Luke Glen-
deningachance. He promised he'd
never quit.

"(Glendening) shows
the younger players the right
things to do and how to do it."

ally in the locker room!"'
Luke had a spot, that much was
certain, buthe was goingto have to
grow into it. First, though, he had
to grow into his equipment.
"Luke tells the story of being a
tin man in the first practice," Tomr
said. "He had all-new equipment,
so he couldn't skate. It was brutal.
He'd never gotten new equipment
before."
"I was a mess," Luke added. "It
was a disaster."
It wasn't long before Beren-
son learned the name on the back
of the No. 23 sweater. Luke was
staying stride for stride with Carl
Hagelin through the dry-land
training.
"First impressions are impor-
tant, and (Luke's) first impres-
sions were as good as they get,"
Berenson said. "I was pleased that
he could outrun and out-anything
half of our team and he was a

"We walked into the rink - I
think it was the first time I'd been
in Yost in a game situation - and
just the smell of the place kind of
envelops you," Tom said. "I looked
up and saw him standing on the
blue line and..."
Tom paused mid-sentence,
glancing down.
"That was all that mattered. He
lived his dream. If that was the last
day he played..."
His voice trailed off again.
"He was lost out there in his
first game. But you don't often get
to see your kid living what he's
been dreaming."

national-title game.

Luke Glendening's journey to earning the captain's'C'

/.

EAST GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -
Billy Powers won't forget thac
conversation.
It was late February 2008,
and the Michigan hockey
assistant coach had just
extended a one-year tryout offer to Luke
Glendening, a forward recruit from The
Hotchiss School, a prep institution in
Lakeville, Conn.
"You're on a one-year tryout," Powers
told Glendening. "If you're good in prac-
tice, you'll stay."
Powers left him with one last word of
warning. '
"If you have somewhere else to go, you
should probably do it."
Powers almost surprised himself with
the offer - he'd only actually seen the
gritty Glendening play once. But there
was nothing ironclad about this offer. No
promises. No scholarship. Just a one-year
tryout.
"I remember the conversation as plain
as day," Powers said. "You really don't have
many of those conversations with recruits.
Usually, you're telling kids thatthey have a
guaranteed spot and that they're going to
be there for four years.
"But I couldn't in all confidence prom-
ise Luke that he had any chance at all to.

crack our lineup as a rookie. It was more
of an opportunity for him to get in front
of us every day. If he felt he could have an
impact on us, then we could try and take
him beyond one year."
Four years later, Glendening is still a
member of the Michigan hockey team. Not
only does he have a spot on the bench, he's
a second-year captain - the tireless leader
of the sixth-ranked Wolverines.
But that's just the middle and t
ending of his story. To under-
stand Glendening's backstory,
you have to step off of the ice kid
and onto the gridiron.

up the fullback on a bull-rush.
The tackling dummy was Luke Glen-
dening.
Stuursma liked what he saw in the
scrawny sophomore. It was Glendening's
first week on the varsity squad. Despite his
lack of brawn, he was already being pen-
ciled in as the starting fullback.
Plucking grass out of his facemask and
The bottom line is that
is a solid person. If you

lie Glendening, had been a Bowling Green
cheerleader.
Joe Glendening, Luke's younger brother,
was an All-American as a junior running
back at Division-II Hillsdale College last
fall, racking up 1,604 rushing yards and 31
total touchdowns. (Even today, when Luke
returns to East Grand Rapids, he's "Joe's
brother.")
Somehow, that All-Amer-
ican pedigree wasn't trans-
this latingto Luke.
Until that sunny after-
take noon on the practice field,
Luke had always found an
nows excuse to discount weight-
room workouts.
s not "Luke always gave me his
theory that weight lifting
doesn't really work," Stu-
ursma recalled.
nuson Being a three-sport ath-
lete - football, hockey and
baseball - through high
school kept Luke in shape, but lifting
wasn't a priority.
That changed with one linebacker drill.
Stuursma's tackling dummy didn't miss
another lift. And he had plenty of motiva-
tion. If practices were painful, Friday night
football games were terrifying.

As the starting fullback, Luke was the
lead blocker for the star senior running
back - five-star recruit and Michigan
commit Kevin Grady. Grady set the state
records for career rushing attempts, rush-
ing yards, touchdowns and points at East
Grand Rapids.
Grady was aburly 225 pounds. Luke was
not.
"I was a buck fifty-five soaking wet my
sophomore year," Luke said. "It's just a
funny picture: You've got this All-Ameri-
can running back and me, this little weak-
ling guy, trying to block for him.
"It was almost comical at that point."
Two years later, Luke had grown into
his role as fullback and senior captain. He
was still the lead blocker for a Grady, but
now it was for Kevin's brothers - run-
ning back Kelvin Grady and quarterback
DeMarcus Grady.
The triple-threat backfield comprised
one of the best running games in the state.
Luke was the leader in the weight room,
while Kelvin, a future Michigan receiver,
carried the load on the field.
"Luke is a freak of nature," Kelvin said.
"He is - he's a freak."

Peter Stuursma raised his
hand and blew a sharp whistle.
A linebacker leapt out of his
stance and tore into the back- -A
field, walloping the tackling
dummy.
The hand went up again, and the whis-
tle pierced the air.
Pads met pads and the dummy hurtled
to the ground again. Stuursma smiled.
The East Grand Rapids football coach was
leading a linebacker drill. That particular
lesson was an important one: How to blow

struggling back to his feet, Glendening
realized that he probably wasn't built to
play football. His genes weren't the prob-
lem - they were probably the only thing
going for him. His father, Tom Glenden-

Green in the early 1980s. His mother, Les-
