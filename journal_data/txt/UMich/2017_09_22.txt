Sustainability on campus is 

more than the recycling bins you 
find in Mason Hall. In reality, 
University of Michigan student 
organizations, departments and 
local nonprofits are focusing their 
efforts on outreach and staying 
green in a number of ways.

One example of these outreach 

efforts is EarthFest. The 21st 
annual event was held on the 
Diag Thursday, and, hosted by the 
Office of Campus Sustainability, 
allowed students and staff to 
browse through dozens of booths 
and learn about how to get 
involved with sustainability on 
campus.

OCS 
Sustainability 

Representative Barbara Hagan 
said EarthFest provides new 
possibilities 
for 
students 

previously 
unaware 
of 

environmental 
organizations’ 

activity on campus.

“Students are very interested in 

sustainability and how to protect 
the planet and how to make the 
world a better place,” Hagan said. 
“It’s our way of match-making 
students with a group that they 
may want to participate in.”

University 
spokeswoman 

Dana Elger said the event sends 
a message that anyone can be 
involved in making the University 
a more environmentally friendly 
place.

“People want to get engaged, 

they’re just not sure how to do 
it,” Elger said. “You have new 

students, 
returning 
students. 

I have seniors coming up and 
saying, ‘Hey, I want to get 
involved. I care about this and I 
want to learn more about it.’ ”

The booths were divided 

into sections relating to each 
organization’s goal: greenhouse 
gas reduction, transportation, 
sustainable food, protecting the 
Huron River, waste reduction 
and 
community 
awareness. 

Many were interactive, handing 

out free food samples and 
engaging students in activities. 
Michigan Dining, for example, 
offered students free bruschetta 
with a display showcasing their 
sustainable food practices. 

LSA 
freshman 
Yasmeen 

Shakour said she learned valuable 
information 
about 
Michigan 

Dining’s efforts to source their 
food locally.

“I always wonder where they 

got their food, or whether it’s 

GMO-free, organic or local, so it 
was cool to learn about that,” she 
said.

LSA 
senior 
Ben 
Iuliano, 

co-president of the University’s 
Sustainable Food Program, said 
he hoped to get more people 
interested in the environment 
through food and expand on the 
University’s 
sustainable 
food 

program together.

Gov. 
Rick 
Snyder 
signed 

a 
campaign 
finance 
bill 

Wednesday, 
extending 
the 

ruling of Citizens United v. FEC 
to the state of Michigan. This 
allows state representatives and 
candidates to collect campaign 
money through super PACs, 
which then permit them to 
collect unlimited amounts of 
money.

The 
bill 
received 
little 

opposition from Republicans, 
passing through the state House 
on the back of the Republican 
majority — only one Republican, 
state Rep. Martin Howrylak, 
R-Troy, voted against it. State 
Sen. David Robertson, R-Grand 
Blanc, introduced the bill in the 
state Senate last April. 

“This 
legislation 
codifies 

the Supreme Court’s ruling in 
Citizens United which affirms 
corporate and unions’ ability to 
exercise their First Amendment 
rights of free speech,” Robertson 
told the Detroit Free Press.

The Citizens United ruling 

allowed for unlimited donations 
from corporations and unions to 
political candidates. Though the 
ruling did not change the rules 
in state races, many states have 
since amended their campaign 
finance laws.

In 
2010, 
following 
the 

Citizens United ruling, 24 states 
were forced to amend their 
campaign finance laws barring 
corporate and union donations. 
Now that Snyder signed the bill, 
there are six states that allow 
such contributions.

State Rep. Yousef Rabhi, 

D-Ann Arbor, opposes the law, 
seeing it as a way for corporations 
to exert unprecedented influence 
over Michigan races.

“It 
empowers 
corporation 

and special interest groups to 
have unlimited power over the 
political process and that’s not 
what our democracy was ever 
supposed to be,” Rabhi said. “It 
was supposed to be a democracy 
of, by and for the people and this 
has created a situation where, to 
even a greater extent than we

Following recent events, campus leaders and administration respond to hate

Over the past year, members 

of the University of Michigan 
have both seen and responded to 
countless acts of hate directed at 
communities of color and other 
marginalized 
groups. 
Though 

the administration and campus 
organizations have reacted with 
activism and messages of support, 

students — along with some faculty 
and staff — continue to call for more 
action.

On Sunday, an incident of racist 

vandalism occurred in West Quad 
Residence Hall: Racial slurs were 
found on the dormitory doors 
of three Black students in the 
Michigan 
Community 
Scholars 

Program. 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel tweeted to condemn 
the incident, but Black students still 
called on the president to take a 
more prominent stand against hate. 
That same day, racial slurs were 
spray-painted onto East Liberty and 

South State Street buildings.

These hateful incidents are not 

new. In September 2016, racist 
flyers featuring white supremacist 
messages were found on campus 
posting 
walls. 
In 
February, 

engineering 
students 
received 

anti-Black and anti-Semitic emails 
bolstering hate groups such as 
the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis. 
Earlier this September, anti-Latino 
and pro-Trump graffiti was found 
scrawled on the Rock, a University 
landmark.

On 
Wednesday 
night, 
the 

Black 
Student 
Union 
and 

Students4Justice led a protest, 
calling on Schlissel to respond to 
the racially charged incidents of 
the past week. Afterward, a man, 
unaffiliated with the University, 
was arrested during a fight that 
broke out, in which he called 
students “n------.”

On Thursday evening, Schlissel 

released a statement expressing 
sadness for the hateful acts, but 
pride for how the University has 
come together to respond.

“The Black Student Union issued 

a strong statement regarding the

THUMBS UP.
puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

Every Friday, the Michigan Daily will be republishing 
an article from the Daily’s archives from a moment 
in University history. 
December 4, 1989

Mounds of ice were discovered melting 

in the University of Illinois Student Union 
courtyard four weeks ago. 

Dumped on the ground by a group called 

Students for a Tuition Freeze, the act was 
organized to show support for an end to 
tuition hikes. The symbolic gesture was one 
more in a growing number of student efforts 
to bring attention to and halt the spiraling 
costs of higher education.

Tuition at public and private universities 

across the country has jumped dramatically 
in recent years. In 1988 and again in 1989, 
the University of Michigan passed tuition 
increases of up to 12 percent for out-of-state 
students. 

The situation is similar at other schools. 

Since 1987, University of Iowa and University 
of Illinois students have watched their tuition 
rise 13 to 17 percent each year, while inflation 
rose no more than 6.5 percent in those years. 

Faced with explanations that states are 

strapped for funds, and universities must 
remain competitive, many felt there was 
little for students to do but sigh and sign for 
another student loan. 

But with the cost of a degree reaching 

well into the tens of thousands — University 
of Michigan in-state residents now spend 
more than $12,000 for a four-year education, 
while out-of-state residents spend $44,000 — 
students are taking action. 

At the University of Iowa, students 

lobbied effectively to bring the rate of tuition 
increases down from 17 percent last year to 3 
percent this year for in-state students and 4 
percent for out-of-state students. 

The one-on-one meetings between 

students and state and University officials 
were “very important” to students’ success, 
said Pepe Rojas-Cardona, president of the 
Iowa Student Association. 

“(Students) raised the level of awareness 

among legislators, who I don’t think were 
as aware of (tuition) as an issue before,” 
said Ann Rhodes, Iowa’s acting director 
for university relations. As a result, she 
said, “Tuition and access (to education) are 
going to be a real issue in the campaign for 
governor this year.” 

Students met independently with 

members of the university’s Board of 
Regents, state legislators, and Gov. Terry 
Brandstadt. 

One of the problems University of 

Michigan students face in working to lower 
tuition rates is developing a unified front. 

“As it stands now, we’ve got a series 

of different voices,” said LSA sophomore 
Will Curl, a Michigan Collegiate Coalition 
governor. Though students are interested in 
the issue, Curl said, “they don’t necessarily 
attack it the same way.” The lack of a cohesive 
stance diminishes student impact on 
University and state officials, he said. 

At the University of Illinois, the united 

student voice is represented by two non-
voting student members of the University’s 
nine-person Board of Trustees. Both 
students enter a “student’s advisory vote” on 

the issues discussed by the trustees into the 
official record. 

“The vote doesn’t alter the board’s 

decision, but symbolizes how (students) 
are voting,” said Matthew Byer, one of the 
students on the board. 

The University of Illinois didn’t raise 

tuition this year, partially due to greater state 
appropriations and partially because of a 
two-year income tax increase for education 
passed by the state of Illinois.

Members of Students For A Tuition 

Freeze hope the university will do the same 
next year. Some students say representation 
isn’t enough. At the University of Wisconsin, 
members of the University’s student 
government and the United Council — the 
Wisconsin state student association — 
negotiate proposed increases with the Board 
of Regents. 

Last year negotiations brought the 

proposed tuition increase down from 17 to 
nine percent. 

But without visible signs of student 

support, student representatives cannot be as 
effective as possible, said Sherrie Bryant, the 
United Council’s academic affairs director. 

“If they’re going to raise (tuition), they’re 

going to raise it no matter what students 
say,” Bryant said. But if students were to be 
“more responsive to what we asked them to 
do,” said Bryant, then representatives would 
have a stronger position during negotiations 
and might have a larger impact on the 
administration.

FRIDAY’S BICENTENNIAL FEATURE: 
NATION’S STUDENTS LOBBY TO END LARGE TUITION HIKES

Professor draws on own experience 
to aid LBGTQ sexual health care

Researcher works primarily with gender and sexual minorities, preventing HIV

KATHERINA SOURINE

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
work 
and 
research 

of 
Nursing 
Professor 
Rob 

Stephenson is dedicated to the 
study of sexual and reproductive 
health. In addition to being 
a trained epidemiologist and 
demographer, 
Stephenson 

holds a Ph.D. from University 
of 
Southampton 
in 
the 

United Kingdom, as well as a 
postdoctoral fellowship at the 
University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill. With a concentration 
in HIV prevention as well as 
sexual and gender minorities, 
Stephenson aims to apply his 
own experiences to bettering the 
LBGTQ community.

Stephenson 
reflected 
on 

the effect his identity and 
background in had on his work. 
He grew up in a rural area of 
England and found that living 

in his conservative community 
presented difficulties for him as 
a young, gay man.

“I quickly became aware of 

how stigma and discrimination 
can have a negative impact on 
your health,” he said.

After turning 17, Stephenson 

moved to London for college. 
During this time, he noted the 
growing HIV epidemic evolving 
around him, and he felt he 
needed to be instrumental in 
positive change and research.

“That’s really how I got 

into the field of sexual and 
reproductive health,” he said. “I 
wanted to make something as 
normal and commonplace as sex 
and sexuality safer.”

Among 
his 
more 
notable 

projects, Stephenson highlighted 
Project 
Nexus, 
for 
which 

he is the lead investigator. 
The project was created as a 
response to the growing need 

for communication surrounding 
HIV risk in male couples, and 
it works to provide the unique 
needs 
of 
all 
communtities 

through these services.

The program sends testing 

kits to young male couples, 
then allows them to schedule 
counseling 
via 
video 
chat. 

Through this process, couples 
are better able to understand 
the results of the test. Their 
counselors are available to help 
with the next potential course 
of action, such as linking the 
couple to further care. Thus far, 
the service has been provided 
to 400 male couples in the 
United States, and this number 
continues to grow.

Additionally, 
Stephenson 

is the director of the Center 
for 
Sexuality 
and 
Health 

Disparities, based in School 
of Nursing. There, he works 
with 
faculty 
and 
student 

research assistants to conduct 
research on a broad range 
of sexual health problems. 
In addition to working with 
LGBTQ 
communities, 
the 

center focuses on women’s 
reproductive health and health 
in resource-poor countries.

“What is really exciting to 

me is that we attract research 
assistants from across the 
University,” 
he 
said. 
“We 

have a range of disciplines 
that come here to do their 
training.”

This year, Stephenson is 

taking a break from teaching 
to focus fully on his many 
research projects. In the past, 
he has taught a research grant 
writing course for doctoral 
students, and he plans to teach 
a sexual and reproductive 
health introductory course 
next year. He highlighted that 
much of his teaching and work 
in research indirectly serves to 
mentor the students he works 
with.

devastating crime that could have 
and should have been prevented.”

Sanctuary cities are cities that, 

in general, refuse to cooperate 
with federal workers seeking 
to enforce federal immigration 
law, but federal guidelines or 
definitions remain ambiguous. 
Nearly 500 jurisdictions as of 
March claim to be sanctuary 
cities, a number steadily climbing 
since President Trump’s election 
in 2016.

Some feel sanctuary cities 

are a danger, and claim San 
Francisco’s 
sanctuary 
status 

made it possible for Kate Steinle’s 
murder to happen. According 
to the Harvard-Harris Poll, 80 
percent of Americans do not 
support sanctuary cities. The 
poll, however, framed questions 
around violent crime instead of 
the non-violent law violations 
sanctuary cities often protect.

In the same press release as 

Schuitmaker, 
Colbeck 
stated 

he feels sanctuary cities should 
not be rewarded for defying the 
federal government.

“It 
makes 
no 
sense 
to 

financially reward government 
bodies that try to impede state 
and city employees from working 
with 
federal 
immigration 

authorities,” Colbeck said. “It 
should go without saying that 
public 
safety 
demands 
our 

police be allowed to report to 
immigration 
authorities 
and 

detain people who are here 
illegally.”

Supporters of sanctuary cities 

feel the cities offer necessary 
protection to immigrants and 

should be left untouched. They 
also feel that not questioning 
immigrants on their citizenship 
status 
builds 
a 
positive 

relationship between police and 
the community, and encourages 
community members to report 
crimes and assist in investigations

In 
addition, 
according 
to 

fact-checking site Politifact, the 
offences sanctuary cities deal 
with most are non-violent, with 
offences often as minor as a 
broken taillight. Often, policemen 
merely refrain from asking about 
immigration status, like when 
an immigrant happens to be a 
witness of a crime.

Public Policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel, 
communications 

director of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Democrats, said she feels the 
legislation is largely reactionary.

“The event that sparked the 

incident is very tragic, but the 
way the president and current 
administration 
has 
used 
it 

to incite fear and bigotry is 
unacceptable,” she said.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Lincoln Merrill, publicity chair of 
the University’s chapter of College 
Republicans, shared his opinion 
on why he believes this legislation 
is an important bipartisan step 
towards immigration reform.

“I 
remember 
when 
this 

story came out,” he said. “It’s 
horrifying and sad, and I think 
this legislation is a huge step 
forward. We know immigration 
is a controversial topic, but 
when the illegal immigrants are 
criminals, you have to take action 
regardless of what your beliefs 
are.”

and food systems will be really 
important 
in 
fighting 
climate 

change,” he said. “I think putting 
a big focus on (food) is a really 
easy way to draw people into 
environmental 
issues 
because 

everybody eats, lots of people 
love food, so it’s something a lot 
of people can get really excited 
about.”

Off to the side of the Diag, 

students representing the Matthaei 
Botanical Gardens and Nichols 
Arboretum helped students pot 
their own succulents. LSA senior 
Mason Opp recounted how he 
was able to relieve daily stress by 
working in the gardens and said he 
hopes other students can also learn 
the joys of horticulture.

“I think it gives people a chance 

to take a break from classes and do 
something interacting more with 
their environment,” Opp said. “I 
started working at the botanical 
gardens in February and I found it 
was an awesome break from stress 
and nasty weather by working 
inside a greenhouse.”

The School for Environment 

and Sustainability offered a virtual 
reality tour of Ann Arbor through 
Oculus Rift glasses.

Landscape Architecture Prof. 

Mark Lindquist explained how 
technology can give students and 
residents a new perspective of the 
city’s nature and environment.

“Hopefully what (people) get out 

of this is a better sense of what the 
landscape’s going to look like, but 
also with some of the functionality 
that we built in a better sense of 
how the landscape might perform,” 
Lindquist said.

she found Turn Uh to be when 
she found the app.

“I came across it in Handshake 

when I was looking for internships 
last summer,” she said. “I am a 
marketing intern, so I came up 
with the marketing strategy, 
which we will be implementing 
throughout the year.”

Dager said what sets this app 

apart from others in its category 
is that it includes events from 
local businesses, the University 
itself and Greek life.

“I don’t think there’s another 

app where you can go and 
find Greek, local, and sports, 
businesses and club events,” he 

said.

The Greek Life tab on the app, 

however, is currently undergoing 
design changes, Dager noted.

“(Szamosszegi) 
has 
four 

programmers 
in 
India, 
and 

they’re 
reprogramming 
it,” 

Dager elaborated. “We input the 
chapters and once the chapters 
get on board they can post their 
events.”

Once 
this 
renovation 
is 

completed, Dager said he hopes 
Turn Uh will be a great tool 
for 
Greek 
recruitment 
and 

philanthropy events.

Sartori and Dager have been 

working to get the word out about 
Turn Uh. They tabled at Festifall 
this year, rolled out a Snapchat 
filter and handed out free T-shirts 
and laptop stickers.

“Freshman are where we want 

to start off,” Dager explained. “As 
a freshman you have no idea what 
you want to do or where to find 
things.”

Sartori said Turn Uh will 

positively impact campus culture.

“I think it’s really important 

because U of M is a really big 
school and it’s hard to know 
what’s going on at campus all the 
time,” he said.

LSA junior Megan Greenwood 

expressed interest in Turn Uh as 
it can be used as a place to hold all 
future event notices. 

“I just get all these emails with 

events, so it would be nice to have 
it all in one place,” she said. “The 
only problem would be if they 
don’t have every single event … 
you have to have all of them.”

Turn Uh is free to download on 

the app store for iOS devices.

racist graffiti in a residence hall 
and that message was amplified 
by university leaders,” he wrote. 
“Outreach to affected communities 
took place through LSA, the Dean 
of Students Office, the Office of 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, 
and 
many 
others. 
The 
U-M 

faculty 
leadership 
has 
issued 

strong statements regarding these 
incidents.”

Schlissel also pointed to specific 

actions taken by the University in 
response to the racist vandalism.

Student 
leaders 
discuss 

activism and support in their 
communities

Rackham student Rosalyn Kent, 

president of Students of Color of 
Rackham — an organization aiming 
to create spaces where students of 
color can feel safe and improve their 
experience as graduate students 
— wrote in an email interview 
she expects there to be more hate 
crimes on campus this year.

“This year, we really expected 

that we’ve only hit the tip of the 
iceberg with issues of hate and 
racism that are here on campus,” 
she said. “That’s because it appears 
that 
white 
supremacists 
and 

nationalists were kind of testing 
out their campaign on our campus 
last year and we’re expecting that 
we will be targeted a lot more this 
year.”

Kent added that within the 

organization, there is a particular 
emphasis on students’ mental 
health and plans to facilitate 
conversations between different 
campus communities. She said 
awareness among students from 
multicultural 
and 
different 

religious backgrounds is important 
and understanding the experiences 
of other students fosters power on 
campus.

“I don’t want to narrow the 

student body into two types, but 
from what I’ve experienced on 
campus there are students who 
are frustrated with the attacks 
and there are students who are 
completely oblivious,” she said. 
“For the students who actually 
want to have a conversation about 
their frustration, they know that 
a SCOR event is a safe place where 
they can have that conversation and 
not be attacked.”

Rackham student Richard Nunn, 

who also attended the University as 
an undergrad, is one of the advisers 
for Latinx Alliance for Community 
Action, Support and Advocacy. Also 
known as La Casa, the alliance is 
the umbrella organization for the 
Latinx community on campus 
and, according to the organization 
page, aims to “be an inclusive 
and welcoming environment for 
all those who value the Latinx 
community, culture, and identity.”

Nunn said he believes it is not so 

much that incidents such as racist 
vandalism are becoming more 
frequent, but that they are receiving 
more attention.

“I think if you look at the history 

of campus alone, series of racist 
instances have happened,” he said. 
“I think (since) Trump’s election 
— and maybe people would argue 
— maybe people feel more entitled 
or more able to express messages of 
hate, but I don’t think it’s happening 
more.”

LSA sophomore Mayah Wheeler 

echoed Nunn and said she believes 
these 
incidents 
have 
become 

commonplace because people are 
more comfortable spouting their 
hateful beliefs.

“I think it’s expected because 

people have gotten comfortable in 
expressing derogatory and racist 
statements towards people that 
are different than them,” she said. 
“It’s a scare tactic, because they 
don’t want you to be here and they 
continue to do things that make 
Black students feel unsafe.”

Public Policy junior Yvonne 

Navarrete is the lead director of 
La Casa and Assisting Latin@ 
to Maximize Achievement, an 
orientation 
and 
community-

building program to welcome 
Latino students to the University 
prior to the start of their freshman 
year.

Navarrete also agreed with Nunn 

that the racist attacks are nothing 
new; she said what is shocking is the 
confidence with which they have 
been presented. Like Kent, she said 
as a student leader of a minority 
group she is often thinking about 
what she can do to help make her 
community stronger.

“While there is always concern 

for how your community will be 
targeted, I think the main concern 
is always how you will support 
each other and what infrastructure 
you’re creating to make that easier,” 
she said.

Navarrete 
said 
introducing 

students — many of whom are 
first-generation and coming from 
a low socioeconomic status — to 
Latino-focused 
resources 
and 

organizations on campus is central 
to ALMA. She said she feels the 
organization is able to educate and 
empower students, to teach them 
their voices are vital to campus.

Others, like LSA sophomore 

J’laina Harvey, are still processing 
the events from the past week.

“Honestly, I’ve been taking 

it day by day, and I wouldn’t be 
really surprised if something else 
happened, so I’m kind of looking 
out for it but it’s hard to say that it 
didn’t affect me because it does. But 
I’m trying to not let it distract me 
from where I want to go, which is 
be successful in school,” she said. 
“So, I’m trying not to let it deter me 
off my plan, however, emotionally 
it is something to be concerned 
about.”

Administrative action

In an email to the Daily, Dillard 

noted racist events on campus are 
not a new phenomenon; structures 
of racism have always been a part of 
U.S. society and at play on campus.

“We need to be careful to 

separate out these ‘pre-existing’ 
and structural forms of racism 
and discrimination from what 
seems potentially new, or at least 
distinctive, 
about 
the 
present 

moment,” she wrote. “This can be 
difficult. Some of what seems new, 
especially to younger people, is 
actually quite old.”

Chief Diversity Officer Robert 

Sellers, vice provost for Equity 
and Inclusion, echoed Dillard’s 
sentiments 
regarding 
the 

prevalence of racism throughout 
history. During his time as a 
graduate student at the University, 
he participated in campus protests 
in response to issues similar to 
those raised today.

Sellers said though the fact 

students have to experience painful 
incidents angers him, he, too, is not 
surprised by the incidents.

“It bothers me to the core that 

there are people who feel it’s okay to 
spew hatred to students in general, 
members of communities of color 
and African-American students 
in particular,” Sellers said. “At the 
same point in time, I must also say 
I’m not surprised, and I am not 
surprised for reasons that are also 
in some ways generational, so I’m 
a little bit older, and as such, grew 
up with the idea of understanding 
that discrimination existed, and 
in some cases and some spaces, 
expect discrimination until proven 
otherwise.”

Dillard added the incidents 

with racist flyers in Mason Hall 
last fall, however, were surprising 
for several reasons: first, they 
appealed to “scientific racism” — an 
old, discredited belief that asserts 
certain 
races 
are 
biologically 

inferior to others; second, the 
flyers 
were 
very 
blatant, 
as 

opposed to “subtle ‘dog whistle’” 
racism-without-race; third, they 
were clearly aligned with white 
supremacy.

“I think undergraduates — who 

are part of the Obama generation 
— had an especially steep learning 
curve to understand what the ‘Alt-
Right’ represents and what the 
realities of racist trolling really look 
like,” Dillard wrote. “And let me 
just add that the fact that a handful 
of these people can essentially troll 
an ENTIRE campus is just beyond 
frustrating.”

Going into the school year, Dillard 

wrote, the LSA administration had 
given a lot of thought to how it will 
respond to incidents on campus in 
which students’ social identities are 
targeted.

She 
also 
wrote 
the 

administration wants to create 
dialogue with a range of students 
and utilize faculty and staff as a 

resource in this communication. 
She explained another goal is 
to act in solidarity with student 
organizations, highlighting their 
support in response to theracist 
vandalism over the weekend.

Within the last few days, the 

University’s Office of Public Affairs 
and 
Internal 
Communications 

released a document highlighting 
all of the specific actions taken 
by the administration over the 
weekend in order to both comfort 
and act as an ally to students: Dean 
of Students Laura Blake Jones met 
with Black students who reached 
out to her directly, LSA Dean 
Andrew Martin invited all MCSP 
students to his office hours in West 
Quad and the Division of Public 
Safety and Security has increased 
security patrols in the area of West 
Quad and continues to search for 
the perpetrators.

Sellers emphasized that in his 

over two decades at the University, 
the 
administration 
is 
more 

committed to promoting inclusion 
on campus than ever before.

“What 
I 
can 
say, 
having 

been here for 20-plus years, the 
administration — I would also 
include the Board of Regents in 
this — is more committed to issues 
of diversity, equality and inclusion 
than any other time that I’ve seen,” 
he said.

Despite increased administrative 

response, 
Sellers 
said 
it 
is 

impossible to completely stop these 
racist incidents from occurring, 
especially in a society where a small 
group of hateful people can disrupt 
so many.

“I want it to be very clear: In any 

society, it only takes a small number 
of people who want to disrupt 
that society to potentially disrupt 
that society,” he said. “There is 
no way that there is anything we 
can do that can prevent any one 
of 80-plus thousand people in our 
community, not to mention all the 
other folks outside of the University 
of Michigan community, to at one 
point or another attack members of 
our community.”

However, Sellers explained the 

University can strive to create an 
environment where such incidents 
are not tolerated.

He equated the racist incidents 

to terrorism, stating the importance 
of not giving the perpetrators 
too much attention while also 
providing the victims the comfort 
they deserve.

“So, we have to find a way that 

both acknowledges the pain, but 
does not allow them to win,” Sellers 
said. “In that context, I would say, 
we’re doing everything we can to 
try to make sure that this doesn’t 
happen, but the reality is that I 
cannot promise that tomorrow 
some idiot doesn’t do this again.”

In a January-February 2017 

article in Solidarity US entitled 
“When the Alt-Right Hits Campus,” 
Dillard 
noted 
the 
importance 

of action at “all levels of the 
University.”

Reflecting on this assertion now, 

Dillard wrote the University has 
made strides but there is still more 
to be done.

“I think we’re moving in the 

right direction but (we’re) not there 
yet,” she wrote. “Real action and 
meaningful involvement has to take 
place on every level and has to be 
about achieving critical mass.”

Students call on administration 
to do more

Nunn explained La Casa tends 

to see 130 to 150 Latino students 
at 
their 
meetings; 
this 
high 

attendance rate and “needs” of 
students highlight ways in which 
the University is not properly 
supporting students of color or 
marginalized communities.

“The University does not have 

a comprehensive program that 
addresses the needs of these 
communities, 
so 
communities 

need to organize to address their 
own needs, and that needs to be 
supplemented by the University, 
because it’s a service that in reality 
should be provided,” he said.

Nunn said he believes when 

addressing 
racial 
and 
ethnic 

diversity on campus, it is essential 
the University understands there 
are multiple communities of color, 
and it must meet the distinct needs 
of each.

Furthermore, Nunn said he 

believes the University needs to be 
move outside of a reactionary model 
and be more proactive. He noted 
the importance of the dialogue, 
which took place in West Quad 
this weekend after the incident of 
racist vandalism; however, he said 
dialogue without action afterward 
is limited.

When 
addressing 
racist 

incidents on campus, Navarrete 
said the administration needs to 
understand what was highlighted 
by the incident and how it is going 
to respond, not just immediately 
after the event but continuously.

“It dying down emphasizes 

that the administration is almost 
exclusively worried about how it 
makes the University look and then 
they react while the topic is hot, and 
if there is no follow-through, then 
it just emphasizes the University’s 
true intentions and motivations, in 
my opinion,” Navarrete said.

Kent said there are allies who 

immediately show solidarity after 
racist incidents occur on campus, 
but such support does not persist.

“In the heat of the moment, there 

is support there,” she said. “But as 
time moves on — and I mean time 
as in three to five days — I feel like 
the campus gets amnesia. … The 
students who have been attacked 
are left without support, and I 
feel like that support should carry 
through.”

On a larger scale, Kent said 

she believes the University is in a 

good place regarding thenational 
conversation 
surrounding 
hate 

crimes.

“Our administration recognizes 

that racism and hate exist, and 
that is something that I think I 
would commend the University 
for, because other campuses hide 
it,” she said. “The University does 
do a good job of bringing it into the 
spotlight, saying, ‘Hey, this is an 
issue, we know about it.’ ”

However, Kent said she would 

criticize the University for not 
being transparent in its actions to 
address such situations.

“The DEI plan that has been 

institutionalized on our campus 
— that’s a great start,” she said. 
“However, it takes many years to 
see the scope of this plan.”

Aside from supportive student 

groups and the University’s efforts 
to diversity the campus through its 
DEI strategic plan, Kent brought up 
the idea of safe spaces, something 
that might also be difficult on a 
campus of this magnitude.

“It’s hard to say whether or not 

we can create — collectively, over 
the whole campus — a safe space, 
because we are a public institution,” 
she said. “I think it needs to be at the 
very foundation — intolerance of 
acts of hate — at the very core of the 
University, and maybe that could 
propagate 
throughout 
campus, 

to push out these people who are 
white supremacists, push out their 
supporters.” 

Nunn said he is proud the 

University 
champions 
diversity 

and that it tries to take a national 
lead on issues of diversity, but he 
acknowledged parts of the plan that 
is lacking.

Though Nunn echoed Kent, 

saying it is good the University 
acknowledges these issues, he 
still urges the administration to 
act more aggressively — to use its 
resources in handling lawsuits and 
racist crimes and to provide more 
resources to students.

“Let’s deal with the outside 

issues, but internally, talk to 
students, engage students, ‘What 
do you need?’ and let’s find ways to 
address those needs,” he said.

For example, Nunn said he 

is frustrated from hearing the 
administration claim thatProposal 
2 — the Michigan statute that 
prohibits affirmative action by 
public institutions — stops it from 
taking certain actions related to 
race.

“I would rather the University 

proudly say: ‘We are going to 
proudly be a home for Latinx 
students as a national institution. 
We’re going to find the best, 
brightest, most talented Latinx 
students from across the country — 
from across the world — and bring 
them to our campus, and and this is 
the way we’re doing that,’ ” he said.

already have, it’s going to be a 
corporate oligarchy. It’s going to 
be the rich who are going to call 
the shots in Lansing even more 
than it is today.”

Democrats 
attempted 
to 

amend the bill to increase 
transparency 
in 
campaign 

finance 
contributions 
and 

prohibit 
corporations 
for 

receiving 
tax 
breaks 
on 

contributions, but failed.

“This is, in my opinion, a direct 

attack on the very foundation of 
our democracy,” Rabhi said. “It 
is in my opinion, one of the worst 
pieces of legislation that Lansing 
has passed this year.”

Regarding future elections, 

Rabhi believes the law will be 

very impactful on the amount 
of untraced money going to 
candidates and how constituents 
will vote once they realize the 
impact of the law.

“I think it will have a huge 

impact,” Rabhi said. “You’ll see 
massive amounts of untraced 
dollars flowing through the 
political process. You’ll see this 
coordination that is unheard of 
and goes beyond what Citizens 
United 
ever 
even 
intended 

between candidates and the 
super PACs. This law allows for 
super PACs and candidates to 
share staff and certain resources. 
That’s crazy to me that we’re 
allowing these super PACs that 
can get unlimited contributions 
to coordinate with candidate 
committees.”

Rabhi added he hopes voters 

will be influenced to vote against 

the legislators who backed this 
piece of legislation.

“It’s unacceptable and I think 

it will impact the election, but 
I hope it will also impact the 
elections — I hope the people 
of 
Michigan 
will 
see 
how 

blatantly in the pockets of the 
corporate interests some of these 
representatives are, and vote 
them out of office,” Rabhi said.

State 
Rep. 
Aaron 
Miller, 

R-Sturgis, told the Detroit Free 
Press that the law is necessary 
in campaign finance at the state 
level.

“This bill is quite the opposite 

of a dark money concept,” Miller 
said. “This bill is a light bill 
concept and it has stiff penalties 
for violations.”

A

re you up?” I ask my old 
neighbors in Minnesota.

“Yes! 
How 
is 

Michigan’s campus faring?” 

“There is certainly a lot of 

protesting 
that 
has 

occurred,” I remark. 
“What are you feeling 
right now?”

After 
a 
chuckle, 

they respond, “There’s 
finally a president that 
can 
Make 
America 

Great Again.” 

Call 
me 
crazy, 

but 
once 
Donald 

Trump won the 2016 
election, 
I 
called 

one of my hometown 
neighbors to talk about the 
result. 
The 
husband 
and 

wife 
are 
staunch 
Trump 

supporters. I was curious, in 
an unconfrontational manner, 
why they voted, and questioned 
why 
they 
supported 
(and 

continue to support) this man.

I identify as a moderate 

liberal 
with 
libertarian 

leanings. When I heard Ben 
Shapiro, a conservative political 
commentator and writer, went 
to the University of California, 
Berkeley campus last week to 
speak, I began to question the 
months- (if not decades-) long 
debate on free speech. When 
Shapiro was set to arrive, a 
multitude of police officers 
entered the campus, buildings 
were closed off and roads were 
blocked for fear of violent 
protest. In addition, this coming 
week is “Free Speech Week” at 
UC Berkeley, where political 
and provocative commentators 
such as Milo Yiannopoulos, 
Ann Coulter and Steve Bannon 
will come to speak.

After these occurrences, I 

really questioned what exactly 
is “free” speech. Frequently, 
I am troubled by some of 
the talking points of these 
contentious speakers, but it 
is too often that I don’t know 
how to process the responses 
to these speakers. When I read 
about the rioting and screaming 
protesters during Ben Shapiro’s 
talk, I queried in a completely 
philosophical manner on why 
there is such a visceral response 
toward both the protestors and 
the speakers. What really is 
hate speech? Is “hate” speech 
free speech? How should we 
approach this discourse? What 
is truly an “open mind?” What 
is moral: to defend the speech 
of controversial speakers, or to 
attack it?

“Hate speech is not free 

speech” is one of the phrases 
I hear a lot on campuses, and 
I think that the nuances of the 

free speech debate rest partially 
on a lack of understanding 
definitions. 
Hate 
speech, 

defined by the American Bar 
Association, 
is 
speech 
that 

“offends, threatens, 
or insults groups, 
based 
on 
race, 

color, 
religion, 

national 
origin, 

sexual orientation, 
disability, or other 
traits.” Though this 
might be obvious, 
the 
root 
of 
the 

argument 
against 

this speech isn’t if 
this is wrong, it’s if 
this is illegal.

This 
question 
creates 

a shifting line of what is 
accepted 
and 
what 
isn’t. 

Some commentators suggest 
that simply being offended 
by 
“micro-aggressions” 
is 

inappropriate 
on 
college 

campuses. 
However, 

lackadaisical action on this 
front can be harmful to the 
well-being of students who 
do fear when blatant racist 
sentiment is spewed.

Moreover, on July 19, the 

Supreme Court ruled in Matal 
v. Tam, a case against a band 
wanting to call themselves 
“The 
Slants” 
(which 
was 

considered a slight against 
Asian-Americans), 
that 
the 

name was subjectively racially-
charged 
rhetoric 
but 
still 

protected 
under 
the 
First 

Amendment. 
But 
the 
vast 

majority of speech, in my view, 
is extremely arbitrarily “hate 
speech” and, depending on 
one’s perspective, “offensive” 
as the definition suggests. So 
why is it that there is this deep-
seated reaction to controversial 
speakers attending events on 
campuses?

It isn’t hard to recognize that 

humans exist on a biological 
leash: We are able to control 
our desires, our emotions, our 
well-being, etc. This goes in 
conjunction with the heart of 
the free speech debate. This 
isn’t an issue of what should 
or should not be said. Rather, 
it is what should and should 
not be debated. And the rise 
of this question is mostly due 
to the fact that politics and 
culture have never been more 
intertwined. Moreover, culture 
is highly personal, as many of 
us know. Politics can be slow 
and arduous. Culture is vibrant 
and creates the norms in which 
most “hate speech” derives its 
importance. The significance 
here is that discourse is derived 
from the Freudian logic of the 
id and ego.

We 
know 
that 
people 

often vote based on their gut 
decisions. However, I think that 
this conclusion has expanded 
not just in voting because, in my 
view, the 2016 election shifted 
the 
cultural 
and 
political 

spheres much closer together. 
Therefore, the more irrational, 
emotional side (id) is at the 
forefront of our debates today. 
Politics, however, were framed 
by our founding fathers as 
a highly rational, ego-based 
discussion. It is important to 
note that the id is far stronger 
that the ego, and too often we 
can mistake one for the other. 
In my view, these two spheres 
have merged closer, which has 
specifically created a broader 
debate on free speech.

If Ben Shapiro and Ann 

Coulter come to this campus, 
I am confident that a sizeable 
portion 
of 
the 
student 

population will protest from 
their ids and, sadly, believe 
they are thinking logically. 
When we are pressed about 
our belief systems today, I see 
more often that we appeal to an 
emotional side and can’t truly 
defend our beliefs. This pushes 
easily-repeatable 
phrases 

that make us think we are 
rational, when in fact, we are 
appealing to a mob mentality 
without supporting or truly 
understanding what we say.

I 
strongly 
support 
the 

idea that through education, 
we are able to create a more 
equitable place. A significant 
portion of education is being 
psychologically well-rounded. 
Therefore, I find it silly to think 
most humans can’t discern the 
difference in rhetoric that is 
blatantly, morally wrong and 
rhetoric that is controversial.

Even so, actions are always 

more important than words. 
This means that those who 
are inspired to act hatefully on 
ethically ambiguous claims are 
far more morally corrupt than 
those who listen, question, 
debate 
and 
disavow 
their 

views. I guarantee if students 
were to listen, as I do, to Ben 
Shapiro’s speeches (although 
I greatly disagree with many 
of his viewpoints), understand 
his logic, prepare for his 
speech 
on 
their 
campuses 

and debate him (and possibly 
win), it would be far more 
impressive. Encouraging an 
inquisitiveness to how these 
individuals 
came 
to 
their 

conclusions, however uneasy it 
might be, is necessary in fixing 
the hyper-partisan landscape 
that we exist in today.

Racist and sexist speech 

should be discouraged entirely 
from our campus, but when 
Ben 
Shapiro 
debates 
the 

pay gap, I caution against 
resistance and hurling insults. 
Any topic of new policy needs 
to be questioned, debated and 
examined. While I recognize 
the importance and right to 
protest such events, I don’t 
think protests such as the 
one on Berkeley’s campus are 
constructive or conducive to 
further conversation. If one of 
these individuals comes to the 
University of Michigan, I ask 
that we not resist, resist, resist, 
but engage, engage, engage. 
Come ready with an open 
mind, listen to their talking 
points and prepare to logically 
overthrow their arguments, 
even if it offends you (as many 
of their speeches do). Don’t 
arrive not truly understanding 
your position, saying irrational 
and commonplace phrases that 
only contribute to a new essay 
on the lack of discourse on 
college campuses.

L

ike 
most 
caffeine-

dependent 
students 

at this institution, I 

make my rounds to Espresso 
Royale on South University 
Avenue before my morning 
lecture. Once I reach for 
the door handle, I glance to 
my right and notice a sea of 
orange, ripped up pavement 
and vacant storefronts. You 
may ask, am I in the first-
ranked college town in the 
country? You bet I am. But 
South 
University 
Avenue’s 

appearance may make you 
wonder, “How is this the case?” 

The 
construction 
on 

South 
University 
Avenue 

has lasted for too long. But 
make no mistake, the area 
was in desperate need of a 
facelift. What is commonly 
regarded as a hub of Central 
Campus has been losing its 
flair at a rapid rate, and new 
construction projects intend 
to reverse this trend. The area 
is in disrepair and with new 
developments springing up, 
there is a fair chance the high 
concentration of construction 
will take longer than anybody 
expects. But maybe this wait 
will eventually be worth it. 
In a July article, the Daily 
reported 
the 
construction 

on South University Avenue 
would be complete by mid-
August. Approaching October, 
the pavement improvement 
project is not done, weeks 
after the first football game. 
As MLive reported in May, 
South University Avenue is 
in the beginning stages of a 
dramatic streetscape upgrade. 
This means the sound of dump 
trucks hauling concrete won’t 
end anytime soon.

The 
street 
repair 

construction is ongoing but 
has taken a scaled-back form. 
What once was an impassable 
street from East University 
Avenue to around Washtenaw 
Avenue is now limited to the 

strip between East University 
Avenue and Church Street. 
Pedestrians 
are 
free 
to 

traverse the sidewalk, but 
car traffic is still limited. 
Nonetheless, South University 
Avenue remains an eyesore 
and I constantly have to take a 
detour while driving.

The changing ecology of 

businesses has dramatically 
shifted 
as 
well. 
Middle 

Earth, the novelty shop in 
business for more than four 
decades, shut its doors two 
and a half years ago. BurgerFi 
surreptitiously 
closed 
at 

the end of last school year 
for reasons unbeknownst to 
practically anyone. Ulrich’s 
Bookstore, though not closing 
its business, is in the midst 
of relocating further down 
South 
University 
Avenue. 

The list goes on and on. The 
change in tenants over the 
past four years exacerbates 
the 
uncertainty 
of 
South 

University Avenue, and the 
rebound 
since 
has 
been 

incredibly prolonged.

Developers 
have 
not 

capitalized on what could 
be 
a 
thriving 
restaurant 

scene. Though a few choice 
establishments 
still 
exist, 

they’re 
too 
far 
and 
few 

between for the area to count 
as a bona fide destination. 
As a result, business gets 
lost to the trendier South 
State 
shopping 
district. 

Make 
no 
mistake, 
South 

State Street has also changed 
considerably over the past few 
years. Even my neighborhood 
— 
the 
intersection 
of 

State and Packard streets 
— 
has 
transformed; 
old 

establishments are leaving 
and new ones are struggling 
to remain. But the difference 
between South State Street 
and South University Avenue 
is abysmal — South State 
Street (between East William 
Street and Huron Street) is 

home to far fewer vacant 
storefronts — if practically 
any at all.

One important distinction 

between South State Street 
and South University Avenue 
is the number of high rises. 
While South State Street is 
practically bereft of high rise 
apartments, South University 
Avenue is the campus mecca 
for 
such 
edifices. 
And 

more 
continue 
to 
spring 

up, including at the 611 E. 
University 
Ave. 
address, 

limiting foot traffic on the 
street’s 
intersection 
with 

South University Avenue.

The new high rises plan on 

opening up more ground-level 
retail, which would surely 
bring much-needed business to 
the area. While student housing 
is an important concern, I 
worry the currently insatiable 
demand for these properties 
will dwindle at some point. If 
this occurs, the lack of focus 
on making South University 
Avenue a leisurely destination 
will see its consequences. The 
cycle will continue again: not 
much to do, more traffic cones 
and undesirability.

After exiting the doors of 

the coffee shop to head to 
class, I take one final look 
over South University Avenue. 
As cars drive by, dust fills up 
the miasmic air, leaving the 
city block covered. The low 
visibility makes it difficult to 
see beyond the orange traffic 
cones. On the other side lies 
the hopefully not-too-distant 
future of this current state of 
mishigas.

I can’t bear to see another 

orange traffic cone on South 
University Avenue ever again. 
After the construction finally 
ends, hopefully the situation 
will improve.

Is speech ever truly free?

At 
3 
p.m. 
on 
Saturday, 

September 16, the day after his 
most recent album was released, 
Open Mike Eagle — the pen 
name of Los Angeles-based, 
Chicago 
native 

Michael 
Eagle 

— responded to 
a 
tweet 
asking, 

“Who’s 
Uncle 

Butch?”

“my uncle that 

served in vietnam 
and used to cry in the kitchen 
when he thought no one was 
around,” he wrote.

The question is a reference 

to “No Selling (Uncle Butch 
Pretending It Dont Hurt),” a 
track off of Eagle’s new album, 
Brick Body Kids Still Daydream, 
his fourth official release in as 
many years. Brick Body Kids, 
though, has far more weight to 
it than his other recent releases, 
with a more concrete mission at 
its core. Eagle’s tweet is a good 
proxy for the intensity that 
permeates the album, whose 
songs repeatedly reference the 
Robert Taylor Homes housing 
project.

Located on the southside of 

Chicago, the project was home 
to 11,000 residents, 99 percent 
of them Black and 96 percent 
unemployed. Its demolition was 
completed in 2007, and it was 
“considered the worst slum area 
in the United States” according 
to a 1998 New York Times article 
titled “Razing the Slums to 
Rescue the Residents.”

While the article frames the 

demolition as a largely positive 
event — an opportunity to help 
move 
underprivileged, 
low-

income 
individuals 
to 
safer 

communities — it’s clear that 
Eagle has a more nuanced 
take on the issue; he lived in 
the project until late in high 
school. The popular media saw 
salvation in the demolition. 
Eagle saw friends, family and 
memory all unempathetically 
displaced by an indifferent-at-
best government.

Evidence of Eagle’s personal 

investment in the Robert Taylor 
Homes project is found most 
clearly on two tracks. In the 
single, “Brick Body Complex,” 
he raps from the point of view 
of an apartment building in the 
development (“My other name is 
three nine two five / Make sure 

that my story’s told / Sixteen or 
so stories high / Constructed 55 
years ago”). The second track 
being the album’s final cut, “My 
Auntie’s Building,” on which 
Eagle is at his most politically 
direct.

“They blew up my auntie’s 

building / Put out her great 
grandchildren / Who else in 

America deserves 
to 
have 
that 

feeling,” he raps 
over 
a 
stilted, 

percussive 
beat. 

He moves from 
confused 
grief 

to not anger, but 

enlightenment, with a pointed 
jab at bourgeois America: “They 
say America fights fair / But they 
won’t demolish your timeshare.” 
He closes out the song repeating 
a line —“That’s the sound of 
them tearing my body down to 
the ground” — where he is once 
again the project itself.

The Robert Taylor Homes 

that Eagle knows was not simply 
a place, nor were its tenants as 
one-dimensional as the media 
insist. If there’s one thing Eagle 
wants us to get out of all of 
this, it’s that the residents of 
Robert Taylor Homes (and every 
other poverty-stricken housing 
project in America) are people, 
just like us and just like him, not 
a problem to be neutralized and 
relocated.

Brick Body Kids isn’t purely a 

work of lament and subsequent 
criticism, 
though. 
Songs 

like 
“Daydreaming 
in 
the 

Projects,” an ode to childhood 
innocence (and its premature 
deterioration), are more hopeful 
and less rebuking. The chorus 
is almost-cheerful with a brass-
accented melody: “This goes out 
to / Ghetto children, making 
codewords / In the projects 
around the world / Ghetto 
children, fighting dragons / In 
the projects around the world.”

Leading single “95 Radios” 

is similarly nostalgic, as Eagle 
reflects on moving between 
homes and listening to music as 
a kid. “The OGs, I miss my old 
hood / Miss my homies, is lonely 
/ The radio host is like they know 
me,” he raps over an unhurried, 
whimsical beat. Though innately 
hopeful, 
Eagle’s 
apparent 

nostalgia 
juxtaposed 
against 

the destruction of his childhood 
home ultimately serves to show 
just how out of touch the higher-
ups of America’s socioeconomic 
hierarchy truly are with those 
on the lower end.

Sonically, Brick Body Kids 

is relatively easy listening and 
distinctly Open Mike Eagle in 
style. The kids probably wouldn’t 
say that the album “slaps,” but it 
is lyrically dense and candidly 
poetic, drawing on a diverse 
body of sounds and samples. 
Eagle’s poetic tendencies rarely 
come 
across 
as 
pretentious 

though, and it’s evident that he 
knows when and how to take 
himself seriously. References 
to pop groups, old video games 
and comics — “Legendary Iron 
Hood” is riddled with mentions 
of names from X-Men — run as 
thickly as allusions to personal 
struggles and politics — “When 
the king is a garbage person / I 
might wanna lay down and die 
/ Power down all the darkest 
urges / Keep my personal crown 
up high,” he raps on “Happy 
Wasteland Day.”

Ultimately, this release feels 

like Eagle refocusing, not just 
permanently 
cementing 
his 

place in the alternative rap 
scene (where he was already 
a prominent figure), but also 
asserting himself even more 
overtly as one of the most 
politically-minded 
hip-hop 

artists of the modern day. He 
balances nostalgic introspection 
with exceedingly clever external 
critique, creating a thoroughly 
cohesive piece that functions 
as a near-perfect reaction to 
the times. Eagle’s calm wit and 
precise poeticism in combination 
with his scathing tongue deliver 
in a way that no one else can 
consistently do, making him a 
unique standout in a community 
that’s becoming more politically 
conscious by the day, and with 
good reason.

Literati welcomes new 
author of ‘The Girl’ series

Before he was an author and 

a journalist, David Lagercrantz 
was destined to be a star 
athlete. But it wasn’t until he 
was intellectually 
touched by a book 
(“Albert Camus”) 
for the first time 
in 
high 
school, 

where 
he 
soon 

put 
his 
passion 

into 
writing. 

Coming far from 
his days of sports, 
the 
writer 
was 

suddenly handed a 
plot, a cast of lively 
characters and an 
unfinished series. 
His task? Finish 
the story.

In 
2004 

renowned author 
Stieg Larsson, creator of the 
first three novels in the world-
millennium series “The Girl 
with 
the 
Dragon 
Tattoo,” 

died unexpectedly of a heart 
attack. 
In 
2013, 
Swedish 

publisher Norstedts contracted 
Lagercrantz to finish the job.

“Of course it was important 

to me to be faithful to the 

wonderful universe of Stieg 
Larsson but to make it a good 
book, but I also had to add some 
of myself and my own passions. 
In the first book, I was scared 
to death about not writing good 
enough. Maybe I also had a 
quality complex. Stieg Larsson’s 
books were not only good, they 
were great,” said Lagercrantz of 
his journey with the book.

Taking over mid-series was 

not an easy task, but Lagercrantz 
has been successful thus far, 
having written both the fourth 
and now the newly-released 

fifth book in the series. Picking 
up where Larsson left off came 
with one major obstacle: how 
to stick to Larsson’s intention, 
while also adding Lagercrantz’s 
own voice.

In response to questions about 

the challenges he faced taking 
over mid-series, Lagercrantz 

remarked: 
“My 

goal was live up 
to Stieg Larsson’s 
quality and then 
of course to get 
the 
characters 

into my veins and 
DNA.”

Though 

Lagercrantz 
always wanted to 
write novels, he 
originally 
found 

himself 
working 

in the field of 
journalism, 
especially 
with 

far-left movement 
politics. 
He 

spent many years working as 
a photographer and editing 
political journals in Sweden. 
He also worked as a graphic 
designer for a news agency and 
became the editor of Expo –– a 
Swedish magazine dedicated 
to counteracting the growth of 
the extreme right among young 
people.

“I always say if you want 

to write good journalism use 
literary techniques, and if you 
want to write good fiction 
use 
journalistic 
research. 

Journalism 
helped 
me 
to 

understand the life of (character) 
Michael Blomkvist. In my heart, 
I am always a reporter.”

Lagercrantz 
uses 
his 

reporting 
techniques 
and 

journalistic background to help 
write the life of protagonist 
Lisbeth Salander — the volatile 
seeker of justice for herself 
and others — the girl with the 
dragon tattoo. His journalistic 
and political background has 
helped him to breath life into 
Lisbeth and the other characters 
in these books.

Though he has stuck closely 

to the plots and intentions of 
Larsson, Lagercrantz does say 
that with the newest novel, he 
takes more risks.

“In ‘The Girl Who Takes an 

Eye for an Eye’ I was braver. I cut 
more and dared to put even more 
of myself in it,” Lagercrantz 
said. “I consider it a better book 
but as a writer maybe you always 
would like to think that your 
latest book is your best.”

Though he is writing novels 

now, and no longer completely 
involved 
with 
the 
world 

of 
politics 
and 
journalism, 

Lagercrantz still believes “The 
Girl Who Took and Eye for an 
Eye” has a deeper meaning that 
relates to the political divide in 
the world right now.

“I, of course, daydream that 

that I can make people a little 
wiser and more tolerant and 

understand that we are in all 
central aspects, the same,” he 
said when asked what his newest 
novel means to him. “It is so 
sad to see the society getting 
more and more divided. Hate 
is obviously growing thanks 
to terrible leaders and if I can 
bring just some of us a little tiny 
bit closer, I would be so happy,” 
he said. 

It 
can 
be 
said 
that 

Lagercrantz 
writes 
for 
the 

purpose of storytelling, but his 
writing evokes an underlying 
intention to make a statement 
for democracy and the essential 
nature of art in this world.

“Nothing 
can 
change 

the world more than good 
storytelling. You can have facts 
of numerous people getting 
killed of poverty and injustice 
and maybe could not care less. 
But if you read a story masterly 
written about just one of them, 
you may actually change and 
do something about it. Art 
and good stories, both fiction 
and nonfiction are vital for a 
democracy.”

Lagercrantz 
will 
be 
at 

Zingerman’s 
Greyline 
with 

Literati 
bookstore 
to 
speak 

about “The Girl Who Takes 
an Eye for an Eye.” Tickets are 
available online and include a 
copy of the book.

Overcoats charm the Pig

I lived in a boring town this 

summer. I won’t tire you with 
the frivolous details of how 
I ended up there, since that 
story alone would probably fill 
a whole page of print. During 
my first weekend I sat on my 
bed in my admittedly lovely 
apartment (note: boring-town 
real estate is a lot cheaper 
than college town real estate) 
panicking over how I was 
wasting away my last summer 
before real-life and formal 
adulthood began.

In that sitting, I bought 

a ticket to a music festival 
that was happening the next 
weekend in Toronto — the 
nearest 
major 
metropolitan 

area.

Despite 
my 
strong 

persuasive abilities, I wasn’t 
able to convince any of my 
friends to make the same 
whim purchase, so I went by 
myself. Being alone, I got to 
experience the festival on my 
own terms, starting out by 
sitting far up the lawn at one 
stage and letting the music be 
background to my thoughts. 
One set ended, leading into 
a 
30-minute 
break. 
Then 

two 20-something year-old 
women appeared on stage, 
wearing oversized suit jackets, 
wide-leg palazzo pants and 
sunglasses that covered half 
their faces. A quick glance at 
the lineup identified them 
as New York City-based duo, 
Overcoats.

The 
visuals 
alone 
were 

enough to get me on my feet 
and walking up as close as I 
could to the stage. From that 
moment all the way to the 
last chord, I stopped thinking 
about my present dilemmas. 
I was distracted by the chills 
that 
pulsed 
through 
my 

bloodstream with each song 
of minimalist-beat-backed pop 

and stunning harmonies. I 
shudder when I try to imagine 
a world where these voices 
never met. I added their debut 
album Young to my Apple 
Music account immediately 
after they bid farewell.

Fast-forward three months 

and I’m at another Overcoats 
show. This time it’s at Ann 
Arbor’s The Blind Pig. This 
time I walk in with the weight 
of a new semester and the 
daunting pressure of trying to 
figure out what I want to do 
with my life after graduation. 
And very much like the first 
time I saw them, my worries 
didn’t make it past the first 
song.

There 
were 
ample 

differences between the two 
shows, as there should be 
when playing a small bar in the 
evening rather than an outdoor 
stage in broad daylight. They 
ditched 
the 
costumes 
for 

everyday 
streetwear 
and 

adopted a lax “talking to 
friends” tone rather than the 
“talking to a crowd” persona.

In essence that’s exactly 

what 
the 
show 
felt 
like: 

Hanging out with friends. 
They chatted back and forth 
between songs, talking to each 
other and talking to the crowd. 
If it weren’t for their perfect 
harmonies 
and 
polished 

instrumentals, I would have 
wondered if I was watching the 
rehearsal or the actual show; 
it all seemed so effortless and 
genuine.

My favorite parts of any 

show were the moments that 
feel unique to that night. 
Artists are constantly on the 
move; they tour the same set 
day after day, so in theory you 
could have the same concert 
experience you had one night 
in a different state the next 
week. Except that’s not how 
it actually works. Every night 
has it’s own moments that are 
a product of the time and place 
and all of the people present.

The 
number 
of 
these 

intimate moments throughout 
the course of the Overcoats 
show was astounding. There 
was a “Go Blue” vs. “Go Green” 
battle 
and 
an 
impression 

of a blind pig. Before the 
encore 
they 
took 
multiple 

laps around the venue, high-
fiving the audience. They kept 
encouraging people to dance, 
going as far as to ask where 
they should go dancing after 
the show (“Rick’s!”). The night 
was singular.

Perhaps best of all was the 

debut of a new song, “If You 
Leave.” Amid the standard 
setlist (which was the entirety 
of Young and a cover of 
Hozier’s “Cherry Wine”), the 
duo 
nervously 
announced 

that they were about to grace 
us 
with 
something 
brand 

new. 
Successfully 
resisting 

the urge to record, I’m only 
left with my memories of this 
initial listen. That single listen 
revealed 
another 
track 
of 

gorgeous harmonies and the 
same electropop rock vibes 
that drew me to them that day 
in Toronto.

Still, the song itself wasn’t 

the best part, but rather the 
atmosphere that the new track 
created. 
Everything 
from 

the nervous onstage chatter 
that preempted the song to 
the 
unwavering 
audience 

concentration throughout the 
duration to the largest ovation 
of the night at the end aided in 
creating the most memorable 
moment of the night.

Inevitably, 
my 
worries 

returned the next morning 
(they aren’t miracle-workers 
after all). Still, their ability to 
create a stress free atmosphere 
in the center of a high-pressure 
college town is a testament to 
their incredible performing 
talent. I can only hope that as 
Overcoats 
gain 
recognition 

for their excellent music and 
begin to play larger venues 
that this aura continues. 

JESS ZEISLOFT
Daily Arts Writer

There are certain pop songs 

from the sixties that everybody 
still knows, and for good reason. 
“River Deep — Mountain High,” 
by Ike & Tina Turner, is one 
of the decade’s most enduring 
songs, and The Ronettes’ “Be 
My Baby” has been consistently 
credited as one of the most 
important pop songs of all time.

Of course, in the late fifties 

and early sixties, it was still 
relatively uncommon for artists 
to write most of their own hit 
songs. These songs are widely 
recognized for their catchy 
melodies and high production 
values, 
and 
they’re 
all 
by 

different groups: The Crystals, 
The Shangri-Las, The Chiffons.

Interestingly 
enough, 

though, many of them were 
written and/or produced by the 
same couple of people. “River 
Deep — Mountain High,” “Be 
My Baby” and several other pop 
songs from the sixties, such as 
The Dixie Cups’s “Chapel of 
Love” and The Crystals’s “Then 
He Kissed Me,” all partially 
resulted 
from 
collaborations 

between Ellie Greenwich and 
Jeff Barry.

Greenwich started writing 

songs as a teenager in New 
York and recorded some of her 
own songs in her early college 
years, shortly before she met 
Barry. After the two began 
dating, 
Greenwich 
traveled 

independently to New York 
City’s Brill Building, a long-
established landmark in the 
music industry, where she met 
Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. 
It was here that she began 
collaborating 
with 
various 

partners as a songwriter and 
session 
singer, 
while 
Barry 

was working with others to 
write songs of his own. Only 
after establishing themselves 
separately in the world of 
songwriting did Greenwich and 
Barry join forces, which opened 
the doors for songs like The 
Ronettes’ “Baby, I Love You,” 
and The Crystals’ “Da Doo Ron 
Ron.”

Of course, the ‘60s was a time 

period when many musicians’ 
hits came from songs they 
hadn’t 
written 
themselves, 

whether 
these 
were 
songs 

written for them by outsourced 
songwriters, like Greenwich and 
Barry, or simply covers of work 
by other bands. For instance, 
“Then He Kissed Me” was 
reworked into “Then I Kissed 
Her” for The Beach Boys, and 
The Shangri-Las’ “Leader of the 
Pack” (also by Greenwich and 
Barry) was redone as “Leader of 
the Laundromat” for (if you can 
believe it) The Detergents.

This issue — the matter of 

song artistry — is an expansive 
one that remains many-sided. 
Although far less standardized 
now than it was fifty years ago, 
it is still common practice for 
artists to have others write 
their songs for them. This is 
particularly 
true 
with 
big-

name artists who can afford to 
bring other songwriters onto 
their albums. When the issue 
is brought up, however, it’s 
less often to bring recognition 
to the songwriters and more 
to critiquing the musicians 
themselves, 
arguments 

generally along the lines of, 
“They don’t write their own 
songs, so they can’t be as 
artistically genuine.”

Despite this criticism, the 

end result is for the most part 
the same now as it was in the 
1960s. The songs remain famous 
and popular, as they should, 
and the people who wrote them 
remain largely obscure.

The matter of what song 

authorship 
says 
about 
a 

musician artistically is entirely 
subjective. 
Personally, 
I 

believe that a song is “made” 
both by its writing and by its 
performance, each of which 
takes a different type of talent. 
If a song really resonates with 
a certain audience, then the 
artist or group who performed 
it should be recognized for that. 
However, the people who put 
the song together and compose 
it ought to be recognized as 
well. My purpose here is not to 
undercut those musicians who 
don’t write their own music, but 
rather to try to elevate some of 
the people who do write it.

Greenwich and Barry worked 

together for a lot of the 1960s, 
putting together songs for Lesley 
Gore, Darlene Love and a host of 
other artists. Toward the end of 
their partnership, Greenwich 
discovered Neil Diamond, who 
went on to become one of the 
most successful musicians of 
the century. Neither Greenwich 
nor Barry are really household 
names, but their behind-the-
scenes 
work 
in 
the 
music 

industry has led directly to 
the success of several songs 
and artists whose work is still 
beloved to this day. They may 
not have been famous singers 
or instrumentalists themselves, 
but the songs that they wrote 
and produced helped to define 
the pop sounds of the 1960s, 
which has made our musical 
history that much richer all on 
its own.w

Breakdown: Michigan vs. Purdue; Cakewalk no more

Three weeks ago, few would’ve 

expected this football game to 
carry so much weight. 

While No. 8 Michigan’s recent 

offensive struggles may have 
boosted Purdue’s chances at an 
upset, the Boilermakers may also 
be a far more worthy opponent 
than people originally thought.

Through three games, Purdue 

(2-1) has blown out Ohio, crushed 
Missouri on the road and nearly 
taken down reigning Heisman 
winner Lamar Jackson and No. 19 
Louisville. Led by fiery new coach 
Jeff Brohm, the Boilermakers’ 
offense is averaging 35.7 points 
per game.

Here’s how the Wolverines 

(3-0) stack up against Purdue:

Michigan pass offense vs. 

Purdue pass defense

A new wide receiver will have 

to step up this week following 
the 
season-ending 
injury 
for 

freshman Tarik Black. Black was 
developing a strong connection 
with redshirt junior quarterback 
Wilton Speight and was leading 
the team in receiving. Sophomore 
Kekoa Crawford and junior Grant 
Perry will likely see more catches 
as a result, and following them in 
rotation will be a combination of 
sophomore Eddie McDoom and 
freshman Donovan Peoples-Jones.

Without Black, the Wolverines 

lose a fast, sure-handed receiver 
who excels at beating cornerbacks 
downfield. 
Peoples-Jones 
and 

McDoom can make up for the 
speed, no doubt, but it’s yet to be 
seen how the two fare bringing 
down catches against Big Ten 
safeties in 1-on-1 situations.

Purdue’s secondary has given 

up an average of 244 passing 
yards and one pass touchdown 
per game, which bodes well 
for 
the 
Wolverines. 
Purdue’s 

experienced cornerbacks Da’Wan 
Hunte and Josh Okonye lead 
the Boilermakers’ backfield, but 

with so many offensive receiving 
weapons — including a reliable 
crew of Michigan tight ends — the 
Wolverines’ passing game should 
prevail.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan run offense vs. 

Purdue run defense

A highlight for Michigan this 

season has been the emergence 
of a consistent Ty Isaac. The 
fifth-year senior running back 
is averaging 112 rushing yards 
per game. He has yet to score a 
touchdown, but that’s because the 
running backs rotate for different 
situations. When the Wolverines 
get close to the red zone, junior 
Karan Higdon lines up at tailback 
and has fittingly scored two 
rushing touchdowns.

Isaac was carted off the field 

against Air Force after getting hit 
in the ribs, but Michigan coach 

Jim Harbaugh said Monday that 
he would likely be fine. Expect 
Michigan to hand the ball to Isaac 
on its first offensive drive. He’s 
been consistent in getting first 
downs play after play and has been 
instrumental in moving the team 
downfield.

Edge: Michigan

Purdue 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan pass defense

Purdue uses two quarterbacks, 

David Blough and Elijah Sindelar, 
but the former has taken most 
of reps. Blough has six passing 
touchdowns so far and maintains a 
stellar 76-percent completion rate. 
He can also use his feet, and has one 
rushing touchdown on 15 carries. 
Sindelar has four touchdown 
passes on a 50-percent completion 
rate. Though, both quarterbacks 
have been intercepted twice.

Brohm isn’t afraid to throw 

trick plays into the mix, either. 
Expect the unexpected. Against 
Ohio, Purdue ran a double-reverse 
flea flicker that turned into a 
62-yard touchdown.

Purdue 
receiver 
Jackson 

Anthrop has four touchdown 
receptions and will be a major test 
for Michigan’s young secondary. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
cornerbacks 

haven’t faced a true pass-heavy 
opponent yet.

Edge: Purdue

Purdue 
run 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan run defense

Michigan 
should 
dominate 

against Purdue’s run game. The 
Wolverines’ rushing defense is the 
ninth-best in the nation, allowing 
an average of 82.3 rushing yards 
per game. Michigan leads the Big 
Ten in that category as well and 
also has held opponents to an 
average of 2.33 yards per carry.

Purdue’s 
offensive 
line 

will likely struggle to contain 
Michigan’s D-linemen, especially 
the two starting defensive ends, 
sophomore Rashan Gary and 
redshirt junior Chase Winovich.

The Boilermakers’ lead rusher, 

Tario Fuller, is averaging 87 
yards per game. Unlike Michigan, 
Purdue doesn’t have depth at 
running back. After Fuller, who 
has 43 carries, Purdue has gone 
to backup running back Brian 
Lankford Johnson just 16 times.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

If you haven’t heard of redshirt 

freshman kicker Quinn Nordin 
yet, just check out who leads 
the entire Big Ten conference in 
scoring.

That’s right; Nordin — a kicker 

— leads the conference in scoring 
with 42 total points.

Nordin has been Michigan’s 

safety net so far, converting 11-of-
13 field goal attempts. His record 
distance is 55 yards, and a special 
teams coach Chris Partridge said 
this week that he’d continue to 
trust Nordin from that range as 
long as wind isn’t a factor.

Purdue 
has 
not 
been 
as 

fortunate in the kicking game. 
Kickers J.D. Dellinger and Spencer 
Evans have combined to go 3-for-6 
on FG attempts. The longest kick 
they’ve made is from 38 yards 
out, and the Boilermakers even 
had an attempt blocked against 
Louisville.

In the return game, Purdue 

will have to be wary of Peoples-
Jones. In the first two games of the 
season, Peoples-Jones made some 
questionable choices regarding 
whether or not to call for fair 
catches. After getting benched 
and replaced by Perry, the true 
freshman got a second chance to 
return punts against Air Force. 
He proved his worth with a game-
changing 79-yard punt return for a 
touchdown.

Peoples-Jones has yet to get the 

chance to return kick offs, but the 
coaches said that he is definitely in 
consideration for that role as well.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

Michigan has a lot more at stake 

than Purdue, but Jeff Brohm will 
have the Boilermakers ready for 
the first meeting between the two 
sides since 2012.

Before the season, it was 

expected that Purdue would need 
at least a year to adjust to its new 
coach, but now it’s expected to 
contend for the Big Ten West. 
Opening the conference slate with 
a win at home against a top-10 
team like Michigan would send 
West Lafayette into a frenzy.

Edge: Purdue

Prediction: 
Michigan 
22, 

Purdue 10

Behind Enemy Lines: Purdue linebacker Danny Ezechukwu

Michigan and Purdue haven’t 

met since 2012. But that’s only 
part of the anticipation leading 
into this Saturday’s game in 
West Lafayette. The eighth-
ranked 
Wolverines 
remain 

unbeaten through the first three 
games of the season; Purdue, in 
a change from recent years, isn’t 
far behind. 

Under the stewardship of 

new coach Jeff Brohm, the 
Boilermakers are off to a 2-1 
start. They narrowly lost to 
then-No. 16 Louisville, 35-28, 
in the season opener, before 
beating 
Ohio, 
44-21, 
and 

Missouri, 35-3.

Their early play has certainly 

captured 
the 
attention 
of 

Michigan — especially defensive 
coordinator Don Brown.

“They’re running the ball 

pretty 
good, 
they’re 
doing 

running backs by committee, 
they know what they’re doing up 
front in terms of the blocks and 
the concepts they’re trying to 
run,” Brown said. “Couple that 
with they’re gimmick crazy. … 
So obviously that’s gotten our 
attention and our discipline, 
and they throw the ball very 
well, which is (Brohm’s) history. 
They’ve played extremely well 
here early in the season.”

While Purdue’s offense has 

garnered most of the praise, the 
defense has improved steadily 
since last season. In 2016, the 
Boilermakers allowed 38.2 points 
per game, which ranked No. 128 
in the nation. This year, Purdue 
has given up just 19.7 points per 
game — good for No. 43.

Senior 
linebacker 
Danny 

Ezechukwu has been a pivotal 
part of those efforts, currently 
leading the team in tackles-for-
loss and sacks with three and 
one, respectively.

The 
Daily 
talked 
with 

Ezechukwu at Big Ten Media 
Days in July to discuss his 
team’s new attitude, changes in 
defensive scheme and Brohm, 

a cult figure among die-hard 
college football fans.

Q: You’ve seen (David Blough) 

since he got here to Purdue, and 
the quarterback’s always going 
to be a leader on the team, but 
it seems like he’s taken some 
really big strides, and it showed 
today.”

A: Man, David been a grown 

man since he stepped on this 
campus. Like, he doesn’t get 
distracted by anything. David 
came here to play football and 
get a world-class education. 
He’s been that way since he got 
here. Like on his visit, he didn’t 
want to go out — he wanted to be 
in the drawing room, in the film 
room, playing football. He’s been 
that way since he got here. I’ve 
learned a lot from him. I look at 
him as a leader even though he’s 
younger than me. I feel like a 
lot of guys look up to him. He’s 
a voice in the locker room, he’s 

a voice on the field, he knows 
what everybody’s supposed to 
be doing on the offensive side of 
the ball, from the protections to 
the routes, to everybody’s first 
step. He’s a leader, man, and 
he’s been that way since he got 
here, and all the success and 
the 
accolades 

he’s 
getting 

right now are no 
surprise to me or 
him.

Q: Why is this 

year 
going 
to 

be different for 
Purdue football?

A: I feel like 

it’s going to be 
different 
for 

Purdue football. 
The 
primary 

reason 
being 

we’re 
attacking. 
We’re 
not 

reacting. The film study that 
we take in, we’re taking in and 

we’re predicting, ‘Okay, this is 
what we’re going to do.’ It’s not, 
‘In case they do this, this is what 
we’re going to do.’ We’re not 
waiting and counterpunching. 
We’re out there attacking like 
teams have been attacking us. 
We come out here and that 

approach 
only 

lasts so long until 
adjustments have 
to be made after 
the 
first 
half. 

We’re coming at 
you. We’re not 
waiting for you 
to hit us and 
then we have to 
make a change 
on the fly. … 
That 
attacking, 

downhill sort of 
play, that’s what 

you’re going to see a lot of from 
the defensive side of the ball 
— and the offensive side of the 

ball, because they’re going to be 
moving like this (snaps fingers) 
and it’s really going to help 
everybody.”

TMD: Does that mentality 

translate to a more aggressive 
scheme 
in 
terms 
of 
more 

blitzing?

DE: Yeah, we’re probably 

going to be coming a whole lot 
more from depth as far as corners, 
safeties, nickels, linebackers. It’ll 
probably be a lot more blitzing. 
The 
coverage 
scheme 
will 

probably be a lot more sound, a lot 
simpler because we’re bringing 
pressure and we’re expecting 
(the quarterback) to get the ball 
out faster so (defensive backs) 
are going to know exactly where 
they need to be to make plays on 
the ball. So it’s going to be a fun 
time, man, and Purdue fans can 
look forward to it.

TMD: A lot of other players 

here have talked about how 

difficult it is to defend RPO. 
When you’re going up against 
that every day in practice, how 
does that help you adjust to it?

DE: It doesn’t make it any 

easier. It’s all a feel thing — it’s 
an instinctual thing. You’ve got 
to be able to react, and you’ve 
got to be able to react fast. It is 
what it is. It puts you in a bind 
because you have to respect the 
run, but then you’ve got to react 
to the pass and rally to the ball. 
Football’s getting way more 
innovative with all these smart 
minds coming to the helm. You 
see we just got Coach Brohm, 
and Minnesota got PJ Fleck. So, 
you know, things are about to 
get crazy up here in the Big Ten. 
You’ve just got to be able to react 
and try and dictate the pace, 
because if you try and sit there 
and react, it’s not going to work.

TMD: In spring ball, did 

Coach Brohm install anything 
to the offense that made you 
step back and say, ‘Wow, I wasn’t 
ready for that’?

DE: They had some intricate 

ways of running the ball. They 
had some really intricate ways 
of running the ball that have 
been unusual. That’s the type of 
stuff you’ve got to do.

TMD: 
You 
guys 
haven’t 

played Michigan since 2012. Is 
there anything in particular 
you’re looking forward to when 
playing them this year?

DE: I’m looking forward to 

their 
smashmouth, 
pro-style 

way of football. I think that kind 
of plays into our hands, honestly. 
I feel like we’re built for that 
and I’m excited to go against it.

TMD: And lastly, there’s this 

famous video of your new coach 
where he has this phrase, he 
yells, ‘Street fight between the 
whistle.’ Have you seen that at 
all?

DE: I have not, man. I don’t 

think we’ve been around Coach 
Brohm long enough to pick up 
on any of his phrases. But I’m 
looking forward to it. I can 
imagine him saying something 
like that, I really can.

‘M’ salvages 2-2 draw

Sarah 
Stratigakis 
beat 
a 

defender, dribbled around the 
goalkeeper and slid a desperate 
left-footed attempt towards the 
empty net. 

All she could do was wait 

and watch as the ball trickled 
towards the goal for what 
seemed like an eternity. 

“If that hits the wrong piece 

of grass, it’s going to hit the 
post,” said Michigan women’s 
soccer coach Greg Ryan.

Fortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, it didn’t. 

The freshman midfielder’s 

shot found the back of the net 
with just 10 seconds left in 
regulation, salvaging a 2-2 draw 
for Michigan (1-1-1 Big Ten, 
4-2-4 overall) at Minnesota.

Despite 
being 
jam-packed 

with tension, Thursday night’s 
contest was in many ways 
lopsided, and if all opportunities 
were equal, the Golden Gophers 
(0-1-1, 4-2-3) could rightfully 
say they dominated the match.

Against 
a 
shorthanded 

Wolverine squad missing five 
regular 
starters, 
Minnesota 

went on the attack early and 
often. The Golden Gophers fired 
off nine shots in the first 20 
minutes, and outshot Michigan 
for the entire match by a 
whopping 39-7.

“We had hoped that we 

would be able to take care of the 
ball a little better and possess 
the ball a little more, but it just 
didn’t go that way,” Ryan said. 
“We 
definitely 

worked to keep 
it as tight as we 
can in the back 
and look for our 
chances on the 
break.”

In particular, 

the 
absences 

of 
defenders 

Brooke 
Cilley 

and Sura Yekka 
forced 
the 

Wolverines to adjust. Redshirt 
junior Taylor Timko, the usual 
starter at left back, had to move 
to 
central 
defense 
instead, 

which cost Michigan a key 
attacking threat.

“It’s her first game at center 

back so it was a lot of learning 
for her on the fly,” Ryan said. 
“It’s a tough position to be 
moved into. We missed Taylor 
because she’s so good getting 
forward wide.”

For 
all 
its 
ammunition, 

however, 
Minnesota 
failed 

to 
seriously 
challenge 

Sarah Jackson early on. The 
Wolverines’ senior keeper had 
to make just three routine saves 
in the first half.

Meanwhile, the Wolverines’ 

two attempts were the two 
best chances of the first half. 
Just six minutes in, junior 
midfielder Reilly Martin sent 
a corner into the danger area. 
The ball bounced to redshirt 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Katie 

Foug, but her point-blank effort 
was swallowed up by Minnesota 
goalkeeper Kailee Sharp.

Twenty 
minutes 
later, 

though, Foug got a second 
chance. Stratigakis corralled a 
long ball on the break and sent a 
chip-shot over a Golden Gopher 

defender into the box. Rushing 
in from the left, Foug volleyed 
the ball off a bounce and coolly 
slotted it into the bottom-right 
corner for her first goal of the 
season.

“It’s all about being clinical,” 

Stratigakis said. “Even though 
they did have more shots than 
us, it’s about how important it is 
to score that goal.”

In 
the 
second 
half, 

Minnesota continued its high-
pressure attack but was much 
more precise. Four minutes in, 
Jackson sprawled to her right to 
deflect forward April Bockin’s 
wide-open effort in the box — 
one of five saves she recorded in 
the first 20 minutes of the half 
alone.

Despite the best efforts of 

Jackson and the Wolverines’ 
back line, maintaining a shutout 
while conceding over 20 shots 
isn’t exactly sustainable.

For 
Michigan, 
it 
was 

sustainable for 75 minutes, 
before Minnesota’s Julianna 
Gernes equalized on a rebound 
from close range.

The 
Golden 
Gophers 

continued to attack, looking 
to 
put 
away 
the 
scrappy 

Wolverines once and for all. And 
they very nearly did — with just 
over four minutes remaining, 
Gernes scored her second goal 
off a nifty back-heel assist from 
Sydney Squires.

With under a minute to 

play, 
Minnesota 
had 
one 

final possession to ice away 
the victory. But the Golden 
Gophers were unable to run 

the clock down 
completely, 
resulting in one 
last 
gasp 
for 

the Wolverines. 
Foug launched a 
ball downfield, 
Stratigakis 
caught up to it, 
and 
Michigan 

had new life.

“Just a great 

effort 
from 

Sarah,” 
Ryan 
said. 
“For 
a 

freshman to make that kind of 
effort to get your team back in 
the game is amazing.”

In overtime, Minnesota didn’t 

appear to show any signs of a 
letdown after conceding with 
just seconds left. The Gophers 
mostly 
dominated 
the 
two 

10-minute periods, continuing 
to be aggressive in and around 
the box. Their best chance to 
win came six minutes into the 
first overtime when the ball 
dropped in front of a wide-open 
Athena Kuehn, but sophomore 
defender Jada Dayne’s clutch 
clearance 
extinguished 
the 

threat.

Looking for a game-winner 

and a hat-trick at the same time, 
Gernes took Minnesota’s final 
shot with 20 seconds left, but 
it flew high over the crossbar, 
and Michigan escaped with a 
result.

“We gave game balls out to 

everybody,” Ryan said. “This 
was going to be a tough game 
and we knew it. We had a lot 
of inexperienced players and 
players playing out of position. 
We just told them how proud 
we were of their effort and just 
sticking together and fighting 
until the last second.”

What to Watch For: Purdue vs. Michigan

The 
non-conference 
season 

has come to a close, and frankly, it 
hasn’t been very convincing.

The No. 8 Michigan football 

team is fresh off a 29-13 victory 
over Air Force that went far worse 
than the point differential would 
suggest. The Wolverines didn’t 
score an offensive touchdown 
until just over a minute was left 
in the game, redshirt freshman 
Quinn Nordin needed to hit five 
field goals and freshman standout 
receiver Tarik Black suffered a 
season-ending foot injury.

Now, they are opening Big Ten 

play on the road against a Purdue 
team that has been playing above 
its expectations. The Boilermakers 
started the season with a narrow 
seven-point loss against then-No. 
16 Louisville, just before blowing 
out Ohio and Missouri.

In short, what was once a 

rollover game is now a legitimate 
contest.

Here’s what to watch for when 

Michigan opens its conference 
season Saturday afternoon:

1. The secondary’s first true 

test

For the most part, things 

have gone off without a hitch for 
Michigan’s secondary through its 
first three games.

The 
Wolverines 
have 

surrendered just two passing 
touchdowns — one of which 
came against Air Force when 
the defensive unit was lulled to 
sleep by the run-heavy triple 
option. The 64-yard pass and 
catch certainly hurt, but defensive 
coordinator Don Brown described 
it as a correctable issue Wednesday 
afternoon.

Teams 
have 
a 
40-percent 

completion rate against Michigan 
and are averaging 125.7 yards, 
while the secondary has already 
registered three interceptions — 
two of which were returned for 
touchdowns against Cincinnati.

Then again, the Wolverines 

are only now facing their first real 
passing threat. Purdue employs 
a two-quarterback system with 
David Blough and Elijah Sindelar, 
and both look impressive.

Blough boasts a 76.1 completion 

percentage with 597 yards and 
six touchdowns. Sindelar, though 
holding a 50-percent completion 
rate, has thrown four touchdowns 
of his own and racked up 263 
yards.

Put simply, the Boilermakers 

have the same amount of passing 
touchdowns as Michigan has red 
zone trips.

The Wolverines are about to 

face a gunslinger in Blough. And 
people may finally find out just 
how good safety Tyree Kinnel 
and cornerbacks David Long and 
Lavert Hill are.

2. Can Nordin continue to 

lead the Big Ten in scoring?

Maybe this Heisman hype has 

some legitimacy.

Through three games, Nordin 

is leading the conference with 42 
points. The next closest candidates 
are Penn State’s Saquon Barkley 
and Wisconsin’s Jonathan Taylor, 
both of whom have 30.

It may be a bad sign for 

Michigan’s offense, but Nordin 
probably won’t be complaining. 
With 11 field goals through three 
games, he is on pace to surpass 
the program record set by Remy 
Hamilton when he hit 25 in a single 
season in 1994. He has missed just 
two attempts while also converting 
two from 50-plus yards.

Heisman? Probably not. But it’s 

at least fair to joke about for now, 
right?

3. Who replaces Tarik Black?

Much conversation has revolved 

around who will take Black’s place 
in the offense now that he is out for 
the year with a foot injury.

That spot will likely be awarded 

to 
fellow 
freshman 
receiver 

Donovan 
Peoples-Jones, 
with 

sophomore Eddie McDoom seeing 
an increased role as well.

But it’s also worth noting that 

Grant Perry and Kekoa Crawford 
will need to rise to the occasion.

Black led the unit with 11 

receptions and 149 yards, but Perry 
doesn’t trail by much — boasting 
10 receptions and 124 yards of his 
own.

Crawford, meanwhile, hasn’t 

fared as well. His five receptions 
for 86 yards and a touchdown are 
noteworthy, but he has shown an 
affinity for dropping balls lately — 
the most notorious of which came 
on what was arguably Wilton 
Speight’s best throw of the game 
against Air Force.

The 
offense 
has 
struggled 

enough in the red zone, and with 
Black out, things are only going 
to get harder. Keep an eye out for 
Peoples-Jones, but bring your 
binoculars for Perry and Crawford.

4. Is this when people see the 

real Wilton Speight?

It may sound like a broken 

record, but the Wolverines’ red 
zone offense has been abysmal 
this season. Michigan has gone 
to the red zone 10 times and only 
scored one touchdown.

Speight 
and 
Harbaugh 

attributed the struggles on the 
goal line against Air Force to 
deceptive blitz schemes, but it’s 
troubling nonetheless.

With Black out and the outside 

chatter escalating with every 
incompletion, Speight may be 
facing more pressure than he has 
in a long time.

Still, we know Speight can 

play on the road. He did it at 
Minnesota in 2015. He did it 
at Ohio State with an injured 
shoulder last year. He should be 
able to do it now.

The Wolverines’ offense is 

being questioned more than ever, 
and with whispers of an upset in 
West Lafayette, it’s up to Speight 
to right the ship.
