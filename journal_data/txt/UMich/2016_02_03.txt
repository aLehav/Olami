University analysis 
shows overweight 
youth experience 

puberty late

By JENNIFER MEER

For the Daily

A recent study led by 

a researcher at C.S. Mott 
Children’s 
Hospital 
sheds 

light on the impact of obesity 
on young boys. 

The study — which was 

performed by the Pediatric 
Research in Office Settings 
network of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics — 
suggessts that obese young 
males experience the onset 
of 
puberty 
later, 
while 

overweight boys experience 
puberty early.

Students express 
mixed sentiments 
on accountablilty of 
state officials in Flint

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

The Michigan Political Union 

held a debate Tuesday on if 
Gov. Rick Snyder (R) should 

be recalled in light of the Flint 
water crisis.

The debate stemmed from 

sentiments 
among 
the 
Flint 

community 
and 
nationwide 

aiming 
to 
hold 
Snyder 

accountable for a perceived lack 
of action and involvement in the 
crisis. Approximately 10 students 
attended.

When the water supply in Flint 

was switched from its original 
source in the Detroit to the Flint 
River in April 2014, the lead in 

the corroded water line leaked 
into the city’s drinking water 
supply, but the contamination 
wasn’t addressed for multiple 
months, until residents began 
complaining of adverse health 
effects.

The state, for several months, 

maintained that the water was 
safe. 
Following 
independent 

testing showing lead in the 
water, Snyder reversed course, 
declaring a state of emergency on 

Students organize 

protest in 

response to group’s 
statements on rape

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

Campus and city police are 

investigating reports of a public 
meetup hosted by Return of 
Kings, a self-proclaimed men’s 
rights group, in Nickel’s Arcade 
on Saturday. The group’s founder, 
Roosh Valizadeh, announced an 
“International Tribal Meetup” 
to unite “other like-minded men” 
around the world on his website.

Ann Arbor was added to the 

finalized list of meeting points on 
Jan. 22. The meetup is planned 
for Feb. 6th, according to the 
group’s website.

ROK is infamous for advocating 

policies 
that 
would 
legalize 

rape in some circumstances 
and advance “neo-masculine” 
thought. 
Valizadeh’s 
“About” 

page on his website argues for the 
maintenance of traditional sex 
roles, and says that “awoman’s 

value significantly depends on 
her fertility and beauty.”

Posts in multiple campus 

facebook groups, such as the 
Ladies of UofM Facebook group, 
on Monday and Tuesday warned 
females on campus of the group’s 
activities.

Diane Brown, spokeswoman 

for the Department of Public 
Safety and Security, confirmed 
Tuesday night that after receiving 
tips, 
University 
police 
are 

working in conjunction with the 
Ann Arbor Police Department, 
as Nickel’s Arcade is within city 
police’s jurisdiction, to look into 
the meetup.

Brown said University police 

plan to meet with campus leaders 
in the days to come about the 
planned event.

“We don’t know what we’ve got 

right now,” Brown said. “We’ve 
gotten several notifications from 
concerned community members 
who are seeing several versions 
of this meeting around the world, 
including one that could possibly 
be in Ann Arbor.”

IOWA — As you push open the 

door to enter Grinnell College’s 
south loggia, the covered area 

connecting the dormitories on 
the 
college’s 
South 
Campus, 

posters of candidates crumple.

Iowa college students, like 

most everyone else in Iowa 
during the caucus, are typically 
surrounded with attention — 
and this year especially, student 
issues 
have 
been 
prominent 

for Democrats, with both top 
candidates 
including 
college 

affordability pushes in their 
policy platforms.

For those students, the weeks 

leading up to a caucus are full of 
candidate visits. At Grinnell, for 
the first time there was a week 
long “short course” before classes 
began where students traveled 
eight 
hours 
a 
day 
tracking 

candidates and speaking with 
lesser-known caucus affiliates. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (D–VT) 
visited Grinnell’s campus last 
Monday. Former Maryland Gov. 
Martin O’Malley held a town hall 
there two days later.

The liberal arts school of 1,600 

students, of which University 
President Emerita Mary Sue 
Coleman is an alum, is known 
for its left leaning reputation; 
the campus has a big chapter 
of 
the

Officials hope 
endorsement 
will encourage 

proactive measures 

By EMILY ROBERTS

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
University’s 

Comprehensive 
Cancer 

Center endorsed the human 
papillomavirus vaccine in a 
statement Jan. 27 calling it 
an important way to prevent 
cancer.

As a part of a group effort 

by National Cancer Institute-
Designated Cancer Centers, 
the 
University 
released 
a 

statement saying the centers 
recognize low levels of HPV 
vaccination 
are 
a 
serious 

public health concern and 
are an opportunity to prevent 
many cases of cancer.

The 
University 
Health 

Service’s website emphasizes 
HPV’s 
potential 
to 
cause 

cervical cancer in women, 
which is the second leading 
cause of cancer in women 
and of genital warts in both 
men and women, according to 
UHS.

UHS 
recommends 
the 

vaccine for females 11 to 26 
years old as well as males ages 
11 to 21, and for males through 
age 26 who have sex with men 
or whose immune systems 
are weakened because of HIV 
infection, other illness or 
medications.

In an e-mail interview, 

Cancer Center Director Dr. 
Theodore 
Lawrence 
wrote 

that 
the 
NCI-Designated 

Cancer 
Centers 
hope 
the 

endorsement will encourage 
more people to get vaccinated.

“There 
has 
been 
a 

disappointing uptake of the 
vaccine,” he wrote. “It was felt 
that an endorsement by all of 
the cancer centers would move 
the needle on vaccination.”

Though the work did not 

originate exclusively at the

Director of Dining Steven Mangan addresses the Central Student Government on topics regarding during their meeting 
on Tuesday night. 

a lot of children with growth 
and puberty issues, including 
some who are overweight or 
struggling with obesity.

“There’s been a longstanding 

history of a lot of questions about 
the impact of weight on timing of 
puberty in kids and so that’s why 
we did the study,” Lee said.

According 
to 
the 
study 

abstract, 
the 
PROS 
had 

preexisting data that measured 
height, weight, testicular volume 
and other pubertal variables in 
3,600 American boys, ages six 
to 16. Approximately half of the 
boys were white, 25.8 percent 
were African American and 24.3 
percent were Hispanic.

Lee’s 
investigation 

reanalyzed 
the 
PROS 
data. 

The 
study’s 
official 
paper 

explains 
the 
research 
team 

“classified children based on 
body mass index as normal 
weight, overweight, or obese 
and compared median age at a 
given Tanner stage or greater by 
weight class.”

Though the results of the study 

were not entirely consistent, 

particularly 
in 
regard 
to 

estrogen levels — a variable that 
was speculated about this study 
but not actually analyzed — 
researchers were still able to use 
their data to make associations 
between weight and puberty.

“I think you need multiple 

studies 
to 
prove 
these 

associations,” Lee said. “One 
study is not going to cut it. I 
think the advantage to this 
study was that it was racially 
diverse, it was quite large, and 
it was a previously unanalyzed 
with respect to the types of 
associations (we made). This is 
probably going to be the biggest 
study of boys’ puberty that will 
ever happen in the U.S.”

Lee also noted the gender 

variances in similar studies, and 
said a unique characteristic of 
her research is the separation 
of groups within genders in the 
study.

“Pretty much, uniformly, all 

studies corroborate that the 
heavier you are, the earlier you 
go into puberty as a girl,” she 
said. “But there was a lot of 
debate about what happens in 
boys, and it’s partly because boys 
are just less studied because it’s 
harder to measure puberty. The 

bottom line is that some studies 
suggest that heavier weight leads 
to an earlier onset of puberty in 
boys, and some have suggested 
that it’s actually a later onset. 
But no one actually separates out 
the overweight boys from the 
obese boys and so that’s what we 
were able to do with this study.”

LSA senior Stuart Hammond, 

who is president of the Pre-
Medical Club and an Resident 
Advisor 
for 
the 
Michigan 

Research 
Community, 
said 

studies 
like 
this 
provide 
a 

multifacted 
introduction 
to 

research. 

“With things like smoking or 

obesity or even sexual health 
practices, there’s this really 
interesting interplay between 
social practices, socioeconomic 
status, and on the flip side you 
have this more medical side of 
things,” Hammond said. “In the 
Michigan Research Community, 
not 
only 
are 
students 

participating in research but 
they’re also in a course centered 
on research ethics, research 
practice, the academic aspects of 
research — teaching them how 
to read and interpret scientific 
papers, how to add to them 
without plagiarizing, things like 
that.”

Hammond 
added 
that 

he 
believed 
the 
study 
is 

important 
because 
it 
shows 

that medical research can have 
practical applications and is 
intersectional. 

“For students in medicine, 

oftentimes 
they 
think 
of 

research as a really hands-
on, intense scientific process, 
or working in a lab alongside 
practicing physicians — things 
like that,” he said. “And I think 
one thing that a lot of students 
realize 
through 
research 
is 

that they don’t need to be doing 
something 
really 
intensely 

scientific to learn about health 
care. We’ll see students working 
in sociology and psychology labs 
or even economics work, and 
through those experiences, they 
come to realize just how much 
their various topics that they’re 
researching actually pertain to 
their interest in health care. I 
think that’s why research like 
this is so important. It adds an 
extra dimension to their medical 
studies.”

#ShowUsTheVote 

Bernie Sanders and support-

ers are skeptical of the Iowa 
caucus results from Monday 
night — and after losing by a 
mere 0.3 percent, Sanders is tak-
ing action.

Sanders has requested the 

Democratic Party to release the 
raw vote count from the Iowa 
caucuses after a narrow defeat 
to rival Hillary Clinton.

Clinton’s assumed easy win 

slipped further away from 
her campaign as more results 
poured in, resulting in an unex-
pected close finish with Clinton 
garnering 49.9 percent of the 
vote and Sanders finishing with 
49.3 percent.

Speaking to reporters on 

his Des Moines flight, Sanders 

claimed the very tight compe-
tition with Clinton in a state 
where she was expected to 
easily win is a clear signal the 
public wants dramatic changes 
in national policies, according to 
The Guardian. 

Sanders hinted at issues with 

certain Iowa precincts, claim-
ing they lacked the number of 
Democratic Party volunteers to 
accurately report delegate totals.

Since Sanders’ request 

for the raw vote count to be 
released, social media users 
have expressed their support for 
Sanders using #ShowTheVote.

Some posts using the hashtag 

have claimed if there is noth-
ing for the Democratic Party to 
hide, then there’s no reason why 

the public — and the Sanders 
campaign — shouldn’t be given 
the data.

Social media reactions 

regarding Clinton’s victory, 
include accusations of voter 
manipulation and claims the 
Clinton campaign outright 
cheated to secure a caucuses 
victory.

Sanders’ campaign manager 

Jeff Weaver told reporters that 
the Sanders campaign does not 
plan to contest the results but 
will instead request an inves-
tigation into the allegations 
against the Democratic Party, 
according to the Guardian.

Assembly hears 
from Michigan 
Dining director 
Steve Mangan

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Central 
Student 
Govern-

ment voted to open South Quad 
early on the Saturday after St. 
Patrick’s day at their meeting 
Tuesday night.

St. Patrick’s Day:
CSG passed a resolution to 

allocate $1,000 out of the Leg-
islative Discretionary budget 
to fund opening a dining hall 
earlier on Saturday, March 19. 
South Quad will open at 9 a.m. 
instead of 10:30 a.m., according 
to the resolution.

Members of CSG said they 

introduced 
the 
resolution 

because they believe St. Pat-
rick’s Day is a high-¬risk drink-
ing holiday.

These policies aim to allow 

students the opportunity to 
eat breakfast before drinking, 

so that they aren’t consuming 
alcohol on an empty stomach, 
according to members. The 
earlier hours are carried out 
in conjunction with Michigan 
Dining, with the funding aim-
ing to partially cover the cost of 
opening earlier.

Similar efforts to curb the 

effects of day drinking with 
earlier dining hall hours were 
implemented 
this 
academic 

year on several football game 
days, following a CSGresolu-
tion passed on Sept. 9, 2015.

At a CSG meeting on Sept. 16, 

after a pilot of the program was 
implemented, CSG President 
Cooper Charlton, a LSA senior, 
said he thought the program 
was showing signs of success.

“We were able to, in my opin-

ion, prevent some trips to the 
hospital because students had 
food in their stomachs,” Charl-
ton said.

During earlier hours on the 

first game day the program 
was piloted on, 1,394 students 
swiped into South Quad, as 
compared to 114 arriving after 
the usual opening time, accord-
ing to CSG. An increase of stu-

dents was also reported at Hill 
and Bursley dining centers dur-
ing the earlier hours.

Tuesday’s resolution to open 

one dining hall early on the 
Saturday after St. Patrick’s day 
passed with 24 in favor, one 
opposed and one abstention.

The holiday has proved a 

focus for an array of alcohol 
abuse prevention efforts on 
campus in the past. For St. Pat-
rick’s day last year, Ann Arbor 
police 
officers 
workedwith 

University staff to form an 
alcohol prevention team.

Guest speaker:
Also 
during 
Tuesday’s 

meeting, guest speaker Steve 
Mangan, director of Michi-
gan Dining, spoke to CSG on 
current dining hall initiatives 
and other measures aiming to 
increase student health before 
the body voted on the resolu-
tion.

Mangan 
emphasized 
the 

importance of the Michigan 
Dining 
system, 
noting 
key 

goals include increasing the 
availability of local produce, 
renovating neglected dining

University 
of 
Michigan, 

Lawrence said he hoped 
campus will be impacted by 
the news, and that students 
who 
have 
not 
yet 
been 

vaccinated will take the time 
to do so.

“I 
have 
treated 
many 

patients with cervix cancer 
and cancers in the head and 
neck region, both of which 
can be caused by the virus,” 
Lawrence said. “Although 
many patients can be cured, 
many are not. Even under the 
best conditions, treatment 
has a lot of side effects and 
there is significant expense. 
Three injections of a vaccine 
can prevent all of this.”

Lawrence said he believes 

that vaccines for infectious 
diseases, including HPV, are 
truly life-saving, and that 
the benefits far outweigh 
the risks, especially when it 
comes to this vaccine.

“It is not an exaggeration 

to say that this vaccine is a 
dream come true,” he wrote.

The 
vaccine 
remains 

controversial because it is 
suggested to be administered 
at 
young 
ages 
and 
two 

children have died of early 
onset Lou Gehrig’s disorder 
after being given the vaccine, 
according to NPR.

LSA senior Alisha Vora, 

co-president of University 
Students 
Acting 
Against 

Cancer at the University, said 
she is glad that the University 
is promoting proactive ways 
to combat cancer. She said 
raising 
awareness 
about 

preventative measures is a 
key goal for her organization.

“Being 
proactive 
in 

whatever we can do is a 
really smart idea and I am 
glad that the University is on 
board,” Vora said. “It makes 
a lot of sense — if there is any 
way for us to prevent cancer 
and if it is something as easy 
as vaccinations that should 
definitely be promoted.”

Vora also said her club 

could use the news to raise 
awareness 
about 
specific 

kinds of cancer.

“Our club is very open to 

new ideas, we ask our club 
members if there is a specific 
kind of cancer that they 
want to raise money for or 
raise awareness about and 
we do it,” she said. “If this 
is something happening on 
campus I think it is a great 
thing to raise awareness 
about.”

Vora said she is hopeful 

about the future of cancer 
research and prevention, and 
believes that many students 
share her sentiment.

“A lot of us have been 

personally 
affected 
by 

cancer so it’s something that 
we all keep in our hearts; 
hearing great improvements 
that are happening, such 
as raising awareness about 
vaccinations that will help 
prevent cancer, is great — 
it is great to see us moving 
forward,” she said.

declared a state of emergency in

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
appointed$100,000 

in funds to research the water 
contamination on Jan. 22.

During the debate, LSA junior 

Joshua Strup, president of the 
Michigan Political Union, said 
the crisis in Flint and Snyder’s 
perceived 
negligence 
of 
the 

issue should not be an ongoing 
problem. He said before focusing 
on whether or not Snyder should 
be 
recalled, 
people 
should 

consider whether any governor 
should be recalled at all, as they 
were chosen by popular vote.

“Whether 
you 
approve 
of 

Governor Snyder or not, he was 
duly appointed through a direct 
election of the people to this 
position,” Strup said. “Similarly, 
if you were in Michigan 15 years 
ago, we had Governor Granholm 
and whether you liked her or not, 
she was the duly elected governor 
of Michigan.”

Granholm 
was 
elected 

governor of Michigan in 2003.

Strup said whenever the matter 

of recall is brought up the elected 
official becomes focused solely 
on staying in office instead of 
focusing on the issues.

“While he might not have 

done the best job, I’d rather 
have him doing work instead 
of making speeches to keep 
his job,” Strup said. “I think a 
recall procedure is partially just 
political grandstanding and stops 
the proper governance of a state.”

The electorate should be held 

responsible for their choices, 
Strup said, and the choice to elect 
Snyder is something that should 
not be reversed.

“Once we make a decision, we 

should stick by that decision,” he 
said. “Our system is not perfect. 
We as members of the state 
must work to formulate a more 
perfect society, but we have to 
accept the consequences of our 
decisions both individually and 
collectively.”

Engineering 
junior 
Tyler 

Dubay, who is from Flint, said 
responses 
from 
government 

officials to the water crisis were 
not punctual and there was 
negligence on Snyder’s behalf.

“Even 
though 
there 
are 

children being poisoned and 
there is something that needs to 
be done, I think we’re going about 
this entirely the wrong way,” 
he said. “We’re focusing more 
on who to point fingers at than 
actually fixing the situation.”

However, instead of debating 

whether 
Snyder 
should 
be 

recalled, Dubay said, people need 
to focus more on how to fix the 
water problem in Flint.

“We need to focus this on a 

multitude of levels to figure out 
what the problem is and how to fix 
it before we go and start pointing 
fingers,” he said. “In order to 
figure out who’s to blame for this 
situation, we need to not point at 
one single person, because this is 
a class action against the entire 
government system between the 
city of Flint and the state level.”

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin supported presidential candidate Donald Trump at a pre-caucus rally in Cedar Rapids, IA 
on Monday.

a 
protest 
against 
ROK’s 

meeting on Tuesday. One 
of the organizers, an LSA 
sophomore who asked to go by 
her first name only, Susanna, 
due to fear of retaliation from 
ROK, said she was initially 
shocked by news of the group’s 
presence in Ann Arbor.

“I 
was 
planning 
on 

dressing up and going out and 
having a fun time but I started 
thinking, ‘maybe I should just 
stay inside,’” Susanna said. 
“Then I realized, why should 
I let them scare me? So I 
decided that instead of letting 
them terrorize our campus, 
we would organize ourselves 
and speak as one voice for 
women’s rights.”

Many 
posts 
on 
the 

Facebook page urged women 
to be on guard, as ROK has 
not detailed what exactly the 
group’s plan of action will be 
after convening at Nickel’s 
Arcade. Valizadeh’s website 
calls for men to move to 
“final venues” after the initial 
meetup; one answer on a list 
of frequently asked questions 
claims that men will move to 
bars.

Susanna emphasized that 

she is not a member of any 
feminist groups on campus, 
but wanted to take action.

“I’m 
not 
a 
‘learned-

feminist,’ ” she said. “ I 
don’t know terminology or 
events. But I do know when 
something is wrong.”

have 
through 
candidates’ 

aggressive caucusing gives them 
a different perspective than other 
universities and, at times, the 
networking does have significant 
influence over their votes.

“There is a strong Martin 

O’Malley presence on campus, I 
think that’s largely because the 
organizer for him in this area is 
a Grinnell graduate,” Wadle said. 
“He graduated this past spring 
and jumped onto the campaign, 
so he has personal connections 
(on campus). That’s something 
you’ll hear about the caucuses a 
lot. It’s really based a lot on your 
own personal connections.”

An 
hour 
away 
at 
Drake 

University 
in 
Des 
Moines, 

O’Malley found support as well. 
Like students at Grinnell, junior 
Gabriela Edwards said she was 
drawn to O’Malley for personal 
reasons.

“I think I’m going to (caucus) 

for O’Malley. He’s not very 
popular so I’m trying to get as 
much support,” Edwards said. 
“I’m from Honduras, he’s done a 
lot of work in El Salvador so I like 
that about him, and he did that 
way before he was even (running 
for president).”

Based on the attendees at a 

rally on campus Sunday, Grinnell 
students felt favorable of Sanders, 
who placed second in Monday’s 
caucus 
by 
0.3 
percent. 
He 

drew a crowd of 1,280 students 
during his visit. Hillary Clinton, 
who won the caucus with 49.9 
percent, made a stop at Grinnell 
in November, and her husband, 
former President Bill Clinton, 
campaigned for her on campus in 
January.

Despite the excited chatter 

among some college Campus 
Democrats before the caucusing 
began, 
in 
contrast 
O’Malley 

ended with 0.6 percent of the 
votes and dropped out of the race 
Monday evening.

Caucus 
poll 
results 
show 

students tended to lean more 
toward 
Sanders 
— 
CNN’s 

entrance polls indicated that 
84 percent of 17- to 29-year-old, 
and 58 percent of 30- to 44-year-
old voters said they were for 
Sanders, while 58 percent of 45 to 
64-year-old voters and 69 percent 
of 65-and-older voters chose 
Clinton.

Regardless 
of 
the 
polls, 

though, for many Iowan students, 
their decision was not as clear cut 
as the statistics suggest. Drake 
senior Kendrick Dewdney said 
he would be alright with either 
leading Democratic candidate 
but, if forced to choose, preferred 
Sanders.

“I guess I’d be content with 

Hillary or Sanders,” Dewdney 
said, “but I think one thing 
Sanders has that’s very exciting is 
the breaking down the big banks 
into a kind of a more diffused 
power, and then also the cease in 
student loans in general is pretty 
appealing.”

Students across the state said 

they were enticed by Sander’s 
plans, but questioned the viability 
of them. Jaylin McClinton is a 
senior at the University of Illinois 
at Urbana-Champaign; though he 
cannot caucus in Iowa because he 
is not a resident of the state, he 
said he chose to come campaign 
for Clinton in Des Moines because 
he saw her plans as most feasible.

“I like Senator Sanders a lot as 

well, but I think for me, (Clinton) 
has some really very strong plans 
and I think that all of them can 
be implemented in the current 
political 
climate,” 
McClinton 

said. 
“She’s 
very 
strong 
on 

voting rights, she has a very solid 
criminal justice reform policy, 
and I think it would be great 
to see a woman in the White 
House as the actual president, 
commander in chief.”

Drake senior JaShay Fisher-

Fowler said she is left-leaning, 
but feels Sanders’ free college 
plan goes too far.

“I’m interested in Hillary, I 

think she wants to make college 
debt-free,” Fisher-Fowler said. “I 
believe O’Malley wants to make 
college debt-free as well. My 
concern is with Bernie trying to 
make college free in general — I 
have a concern with that. That’s 
kind of unreasonable, and you 
don’t want to take the value away 
from a degree or a value from 
education. I think paying to go to 
school is good; it places value on 
the education that you’re getting 
versus getting an education for 
free. I really do like O’Malley’s 
and 
Hillary’s 
standpoint 
on 

leaving college debt-free.”

Sophomore Logan Kentner, 

president of the Drake University 
College Republicans, said as a 
college student he would like to 
see reform to make college more 
affordable, but felt making it free 
was too far.

“I see college as an investment 

into your future,” Kentner said. “I 
think that trying to make college 
free is absurd because it’s not 
really an investment if it’s free. I 
do think that making it affordable 
is realistic, and it needs to be 
done, but there’s limitations to 
that.”

On college campuses and even 

at Republican candidate rallies, it 
was difficult to find conservative 
students among the crowds of 
supporters. Kentner said he was 
unsure of who Drake University 
students were leaning toward, 
but had heard a lot of talk about 
Jeb Bush. Bush ended in sixth 
place, carrying 2.8 percent of the 
votes, far behind U.S. Sen. Ted 
Cruz (R-Tex.), who won with 27.7 
percent.

“I think there’s a large support 

of Jeb on campus,” Kentner said. 
“And you’re going to see a large 
support group for the more 
moderate 
people 
on 
campus 

just because college campuses 
typically don’t lean too far right 
— specifically on social issues.”

Kentner 
said 
Drake 

conservatives 
were 
most 

interested in economic policy.

At the University of Michigan, 

earlier this year, the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans 
told The Michigan Daily that in a 
straw poll conducted among the 
group, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R–
Fla.) was the favored candidate 
among the group. Rubio notched 
a third place finish in Iowa, 
carrying 23.1 percent of the vote.

Few 
college-aged 
students 

were present at a Cruz rally in 
Iowa City Sunday. Of the few 
students at a Donald Trump 
rally in Cedar Rapids, most 
interviewed said they went to see 
him because they were curious, 
but didn’t necessarily side with 
their beliefs.

Trump came in second place 

in Monday’s caucuses with 24.3 
percent of the vote.

Hamline University freshman 

Chris Covert, a Iowa native who 
attended Trump’s Cedar Rapids 
rally, said he felt the candidate, 
while important to see, didn’t 
address issues he was interested 
in such as global warming and 
national security.

“His message is so provocative 

and 
it 
catches 
the 
people’s 

attention, and that’s something 
that spoke to me,” Covert said. 
“He’s not a politician people are 

used to, he’s speaking a message 
that goes against the federalist 
system that we have now. I’m not 
a huge Trump fan at all, I’m more 
of a Sanders guy but I think it’s 
important to pay attention and 
follow the political scene.”

Emily Montgomery, a masters 

student at Appalachian State 
University in North Carolina, 
wore a Donald Trump beanie 
to the rally, which she attended 
with a class. She said she likes 
Trump because his beliefs align 
with hers on immigration.

“I’m 
interested 
in 
the 

Republican Party in general, it’s 
what I identify with, and I’m 
interested in his immigration 
reform; that’s what draws him to 
me the most,” Montgomery said.

For some students across the 

aisle, immigration also proved 
important. 
Fisher-Fowler 
and 

Edwards both said they have 
friends 
whose 
parents 
are 

undocumented, and that’s what 
drove them to caucus Democrat.

Wadle, Grinnell sophomore 

and president of the Grinnell 
College Campus Democrats, said 
Grinnell students are passionate 
about both national issues such 
as 
college 
affordability 
and 

improving economic inequality, 
and local issues like renewable 
fuel standards and economic 
development of rural areas.

At 
Clinton’s 
Des 
Moines 

rally, Simpson College seniors 
Natasha 
Shehade 
and 
Sarah 

Beadle, wearing pink Planned 
Parenthood shirts, said they 
supported her because of her 
commitment to women’s health 
care.

“I really appreciate Planned 

Parenthood’s support of Hillary 
Clinton; personally, reproductive 
health is so important to me,” 
Shehade said. “They haven’t 
supported a candidate in over 
100 years which speaks a lot to 
how important they think her 
work as president would be for 
reproductive health.”

Beadle said she was interested 

in Clinton’s devotion to the 
Affordable Care Act, an issue 
Clinton 
has 
used 
to 
draw 

distinctions between herself and 
Sanders.

“Her general feelings on health 

care is a big issue for me,” Beadle 
said. “I love that Obamacare 
allows collegiate students to be 
on their parents’ health care until 
they’re 26. I know I plan on going 
to grad school, and not having to 
worry about the gap between my 
employment in the summer is 
really nice.”

For students in other states 

with 
later 
primaries, 
like 

Michigan, the opportunities to 
engage as directly might not be as 
present. Most candidates on both 
sides have been to the state only 
once or twice since announcing 
their campaign, or not at all, such 
as Sanders.

Wadle said given the extra 

attention Iowa gets in the process, 
it’s heavily important for college 
students in the state to take part 
and show that they care about the 
issues and want to engage.

“To 
have 
young 
people 

participating, 
that’s 
the 

most important thing to me 
personally,” Wadle said. “It’s 
really important that we have 
a strong presence in the Iowa 
caucus and we show that young 
people are politically engaged and 
they are thinking about what they 
want — and they have a variety of 
opinions. And making sure that 
we continue that representation 
on into the county convention, 
the district convention, the state 
convention and then hopefully 
having some delegates from Iowa 
to the national convention.”

halls — particularly Bursley 
Dining Hall — and creating 
cheaper Acatering for stu-
dent organizations.

“We are able to not only 

move this food program 
forward for (students), but 
have an instrumental role in 
developing a lot of careers 
that work in our industry, 
(and) provide jobs for (stu-
dents and their) peers,” he 
told the Assembly.

Mangan said Michigan 

Dining also plans to initiate 
nutritional workshops and 
wellness initiatives to teach 
and 
encourage 
students 

how to cook and eat health-
ily even if they no longer 
have a meal plan.

olution the body will vote

recommend the Starboard

trators keep Wendy’s in the

considered when choosing 
what replaces it.

Currently, the Starboard

Let’s be friends

S

aturday, Jan. 23, news broke 
that Michael Bloomberg was 
mulling a run for president. 

The 73-year-old 
billionaire 
and 

Independent 
former mayor of 
New York City 
had 
instructed 

advisers to draw 
up plans for a 
campaign. 
By 

the 
following 

Monday 
morn-

ing, however, his 
possible 
cam-

paign had been 
pronounced dead 
by thousands. Not by ballots or polls, 
or any sort of popular voice, but by 
likes, comments and retweets.

Almost immediately, editorials 

flooded into the news cycle, ques-
tioning his chances and declaring 
him the 2016 equivalent of Ralph 
Nader. But why? In a race that fea-
tures intensely polarizing candi-
dates and a profound divide between 
party insiders and “anti-establish-
ment” candidates, Bloomberg has 
the potential to capture the ideologi-
cal middle. It may not be apparent, 
but as party-faithfuls in Iowa and 
New Hampshire embrace hyper-
conservative rhetoric on the right 
and populist progressivism on the 
left, there are many voters who are 
not comfortable voting for a Donald 
Trump or a Bernie Sanders.

Mayor Bloomberg has proven suc-

cessful in both the public and private 
sectors. Relatively popular during 
his tenure in the Big Apple, he led 
the fight to reform public schools 
(with an 18-percent increase in 
high school graduation rates within 
five years of his taking office). He 
fought to reduce greenhouse gases, 
improved the city’s transportation 
system and helped reduce crime 
rates. If he could do to the country 
what he did to New York City, he 
would be one of the best presidents 
in modern history. Being socially 
liberal and fiscally conservative, 
Bloomberg is both pro-abortion 
rights and pro-immigration reform. 
So why, exactly, is he plagued by 
articles titled “No way, no how” and 
“Why Michael Bloomberg for presi-

dent makes no sense”?

In this age of round-the-clock 

coverage and constant activity on 
social media, this new brand of 
article seems to dominate the news. 
Journalists, for the sake of ease and 
click-bait value, forego declarative 
statements and title their articles 
with a question, opening up discus-
sion often without taking on the 
responsibility of answering it. From 
“Is Hillary Clinton more elect-
able than Bernie Sanders?” to “Can 
Establishment Candidate Rubio Still 
Win for the GOP?,” articles lazily 
disregard an old adage in journalism 
— any headline that ends in a ques-
tion mark can be answered by the 
word no. Otherwise, they’d be titled 
“Hillary Clinton is more electable 
than Bernie Sanders” and “Estab-
lishment Candidate Rubio Can Win 
for the GOP.” By framing these 
articles as questions, seeds of doubt 
are planted from the outset. Readers 
can draw conclusions without get-
ting past the title — it happened nine 
months ago with Bernie Sanders 
and it’s happening once again with 
Michael Bloomberg.

Days later, these sentiments were 

echoed by polls that placed Bloom-
berg at around 9 percent in races 
against Republican and Democratic 
frontrunners. In this way, articles 
and the journalists who write them 
appear impartial and unbiased — but 
Americans’ obsession with polls is 
misleading at best and downright 
corruptive at worst. Check the poll 
numbers on Bernie Sanders during 
his campaign’s early stages. He was 
referred to as the Ron Paul of the left 
— a quixotic long shot, a fly on the 
windshield of the Clinton machine. 
But after surmounting the challenge 
of low name recognition and carving 
out his support in the liberal base, 
Sanders is a household name, and 
millennials across the country are 
“feeling the Bern.”

One of the most common themes 

in the primaries thus far has been 
electability. Can this candidate suc-
ceed outside of the primary states? 
Sanders clings to polls that say he 
fares better than Hillary Clinton 
against the majority of Republicans, 
while Trump rallies are often high-
lighted by cherry-picked data that 

claim he is the outright and indisput-
able favorite over Cruz and Rubio. 
But what each and every analysis 
leaves out is that electability is an 
entirely subjective and (more impor-
tantly) fluid concept.

In 2008, similar remarks about 

viability were leveled against a 
young African American senator 
from Illinois. In 1959, Democrats 
and journalists worried over the 
prospect of nominating a Catho-
lic — but all their intel and politi-
cal acumen were invalidated when 
John F. Kennedy walloped Hubert 
Humphrey in widely Protestant 
West Virginia and went on to win 
the nomination.

To be fair, if ever there was a pres-

idential election to cover, it would be 
this one. As easy as it is to blame “the 
media” for the long list of problems 
our society faces, put yourself in the 
shoes of someone who writes for The 
Huffington Post or hosts a political 
podcast, or has airtime on Fox News 
or MSNBC. How could you resist 
discussing a loudmouthed reality 
television star feuding with a Cana-
dian-born immigration crusader, or 
a fiery progressive with a Brooklyn 
accent challenging a former first 
lady? This election has been political 
theater at its best.

When I read the articles that 

explained why Michael Bloomberg 
has no shot at moving into the White 
House in 2017, I didn’t entirely dis-
agree. I think he lacks the charisma 
and the foreign policy experience. 
His support of the Stop-and-Frisk 
program will complicate his appeal 
to African Americans and Latino 
voters. But by no means is he the 
unfathomable long-shot the media 
has painted him to be.

Think of how many decisions have 

been made for the entire election 
season before the Iowa caucuses. 
Candidates have been pronounced 
underdogs, frontrunners, dead in 
the water or building momentum. 
All without a single vote cast. So, at 
least in the case of Michael Bloom-
berg’s presidential campaign, I’m 
not quite ready to accept the fore-
gone conclusions.

A 

couple weeks ago, I accepted an 
invitation to get coffee with someone 
I’d never met before. Asking someone 

you don’t know well out 
for coffee seems normal, 
but I mean it when I say 
that I’d never met this 
person before — I didn’t 
even know what he (or 
she) 
looked 
like. 
The 

idea was to have fun and 
maybe make a new friend. 
The initiative came from a 
new campus group called 
Argo UMich.

Argo 
finds 
it 
can 

sometimes be hard to 
meet people outside the 
confines of class, something students across 
the University can related to. It’s intimidating 
to strike up a conversation with someone who 
just happens to be walking across the Diag in 
the same direction as you — as Argo explained 
in an e-mail with the Daily, “If you’re not in the 
same class or club, you don’t have an excuse.” 
Sometimes you’re too busy to join new clubs or 
take on more extracurricular activities. Maybe 
partying isn’t really your scene because you 
prefer talking to people one-on-one in places 
where you don’t find it necessary to shout over 
the music.

You probably know you’re capable of being 

funny and interesting — that you’re able to 
hold a conversation, but only if you’re given 
the chance to get one started. And it can be 
hard to maintain relationships when you’re 
not involved in activities with your friends, 
instead having to schedule times when you can 
meet up in person. With all of those things in 
mind, I signed up for a Friday afternoon slot 
at Sweetwaters on East Liberty Street. At the 
very least, I figured I’d be able to enjoy a hot 
cup of tea and some macarons.

Argo sends e-mails to each pair of students 

a few minutes before their friend-date is 
supposed to start, providing each with a link 
to the other’s Facebook page and offering a 
short list of questions to get the conversation 
going. But since I don’t have data on my phone 
and was coming straight from class, I didn’t 
have a chance to so much as glance at my 
mystery-friend’s profile picture, and worried 
that I wouldn’t be able to recognize whoever 
I was meeting. Almost as soon as I walked in, 
though, I was greeted by another girl with the 
words, “Hi, are you here for Argo?”

Over hot drinks, we got as far as the first 

question Argo had sent along — What is 
something you used to do as a child that you 
wish you could still do? Then the talk went in 
a totally different direction as we discovered 
a strong passion we both shared: a love of 
art. We swapped preferences for paints and 
the best places to buy art supplies (agreeing 

on www.dickblick.com, nodding sadly to the 
Walgreens that was once Michigan Book & 
Supply). We complimented pictures of one 
another’s pieces that we had on our laptops 
and phones. When it was time for both of us 
to leave, we looked up and found the hour had 
flown by.

As Argo had hoped would be the case, we had 

fun. Though the organization doesn’t match 
people for their preferences, instead using 
time and location to set up the coffee dates, we 
were able to find an area which we had a lot in 
common, and that’s what Argo hopes for: “We 
know there is something really exciting and 
powerful about meeting someone new and 
discovering all that you have in common and all 
that makes you different — and we don’t think 
students get the opportunity to connect with 
one another in this way very often, if at all.”

Though I haven’t kept in touch with the girl 

I talked to that rainy Friday afternoon, I did 
enjoy myself as we shared stories of something 
we both love doing. And I was able to relax 
because I knew we had each chosen to be in 
that place at that time, listening to one another. 
“Both parties sign up for our service,” Argo 
says. “So both parties want to meet someone 
new. … That eliminates a lot of the anxiety we 
feel when we don’t know if someone actually 
wants us to talk to them.”

Overall, the response to Argo has been 

very positive: “We don’t personally know the 
majority of students who signed up for friend-
dates, and that’s been really validating because 
it tells us that yes, there is a problem, and Argo 
might be the way to solve it.”

Ultimately, they want to help people 

recognize that there are others out there who 
feel the same way they do — who understand 
how, without a class or club to provide a 
connection, starting conversations might seem 
a little weird.

“You can’t just strike up a conversation 

with the person next to you at the dining hall 
without getting, at least in some way, a ‘why 
are you talking to me?’ vibe,” Argo explains. 
It’s hard to turn strangers into friends, and 
Argo understands this — it’s what spawned 
the idea for the organization in the first place. 
As students become comfortable with Argo, 
and as it becomes a part of the culture here 
on campus, the organization aims to continue 
expanding its reach by taking the openness it 
promotes outside the boundaries of friend-
dates. “Eventually, our hope is that after 
using Argo a handful of times, students will 
learn that they can talk to anyone, and even 
more so, that they should.”

The University of Michigan-Ann 

Arbor is testing new approaches 
to recruit and enroll more high-
achieving, 
low-income 
students 

from across the state. But will these 
efforts be enough to attract and 
retain students — most of whom are 
the first in their families to attend 
college? To illustrate low-income, 
first-gen 
student 
experiences, 

imagine Eve — the daughter of 
factory 
workers 
— 
graduating 

high school as class valedictorian. 
She is the oldest of three children 
and her parents have combined 
yearly incomes of $35,000. Eve has 
been accepted to the University of 
Michigan and she loves Wolverine 
football.

When her financial aid package 

arrives, Eve sees both scholarship 
and work-study offers — neither 
will have to be paid back. However, 
she will need substantial tuition 
loans over four years. This worries 
her parents, but she is determined 
to enroll in her dream college and 
eventually attend medical school.

By early November of her first 

year, 
Eve 
realizes 
significant 

differences between her and her 
peers. New friends have travelled 
overseas on multiple family trips and 
everyone has plenty of extra money 
to buy things like football tickets. 
She will not be watching football in 
the Big House. Her roommate, the 
daughter of a cardiovascular surgeon 
and a trial attorney, is surprised Eve’s 
parents are blue-collar workers. 
Others proudly announce they will 
leave college with very little debt. 
How can this be? Eve wonders. 
But when she learns from her 
sociology professor that 36 percent 
of Michigan freshmen have family 
yearly incomes more than $200,000, 
she understands. 

Eve 
is 
doing 
very 
well 
in 

her 
classes, 
especially 
organic 

chemistry, 
but 
is 
feeling 
self-

conscious and rather exotic. Did she 
make the right decision to attend 

a college where she feels so out of 
place? Are there any other first-
gens? Does Michigan even recognize 
students like her? Is there a place to 
go and talk about her adjustment 
difficulties?

To help address financial struggles 

for students like Eve, Michigan has 
recently announced a pilot two-year 
scholarship called High Achieving 
Involved Leader for qualified, low-
income Michigan students. HAIL 
pays four years of tuition and covers 
$60,000 of necessary fees. Students, 
parents and guardians, high school 
principals and counselors at 259 
Michigan public schools (rural, 
suburban and urban) all receieved 
HAIL information last fall.

Another 
hands-on 
program 

recognizing economic challenges is 
a new LSA laptop computer policy. 
Low-income LSA students can loan 
laptops — at no charge — for the 
duration of their four years of study. 
This initiative will likely continue in 
the future and could be a significant 
resource for HAIL students and 
other incoming freshmen.

We 
hope 
other 
colleges 
— 

Engineering, Business and Nursing, 
for example — initiate similar 
policies because buying a computer 
can be a major financial burden for 
lower-income families.

We 
celebrate 
initiatives 
to 

help talented, low-income, first-
gen 
students 
pay 
for 
college, 

but we wonder if the University 
will also provide the necessary 
social support structures. Will 
the University assist low-income 
students in feeling comfortable 
on a campus where 89 percent 
of students have parents with a 
college degree, and likely much 
higher household incomes?

Research 
tells 
us 
that 

economically 
disadvantaged 

students — both white students 
and 
students 
of 
color 
— 
on 

predominantly 
middle-and 

upper-middle-class 
campuses, 

like Michigan, often feel isolated. 
Attending a highly selective college 
is the initial stage in the difficult 
process of upward mobility — 
widely encouraged and celebrated 
in American culture. But this can 
be very complicated for students 
as 
they 
pull 
away 
from 
the 

working-class communities that 
carefully nurtured them. Colleges 
like Michigan become portals to 
unfamiliar economically privileged 
experiences 
and 
futures. 
Will 

HAIL recognize these well-known 
facts and help students achieve a 
sense of belonging — especially in 
their first two years of college?

Could a new First Generation 

Student 
Office, 
for 
example, 

provide highly visible recognition 
that 
low-income 
students 
are 

present and supported on campus? 
An office could offer first-gens 
space to meet and help promote 
academic and personal success. 
Other universities have recognized 
these first-gen challenges.

Five 
years 
ago, 
Stanford 

University established a Diversity 
and First-Gen Office that helps 
direct 
first-gens 
to 
needed 

resources (e.g. academic advising 
and 
career 
planning). 
Highly 

selective campuses can feel quite 
foreboding for those who have 
grown up in the working and lower 
classes. Parents and students look 
to the University of Michigan, 
with its considerable resources, for 
leadership in providing essential 
support networks for low-income, 
first-generation students as they 
pursue their American dreams.

‘Healthonism:’ Work 

hard, play hard

L

ast August, on the 
last weekend of my 
summer internship, 

I entered a four-mile race in 
Bethlehem, PA. Though the 
town was 
typically 
quiet that 
summer, 
empty of 
neigh-
boring 
Lehigh 
Uni-
versity 
students, 
this par-
ticular weekend marked the 
grand opening of Musikfest: a 
10-day extravaganza of bands, 
beer and every form of fried 
food you can imagine, attended 
by more than a million people 
each year. Luckily, not every 
visitor entered the race that 
morning, and I was able to snag 
the first place prize: two tick-
ets to a concert of my choice 
(the options were O.A.R., 
Snoop Dogg and 3 Doors 
Down; I chose O.A.R.) and a 
refillable beer mug the size of a 
small child.

I was thrilled. Sticking my 

swag behind a tree, I ran a 
few cool-down miles to shake 
out my stiffening muscles, but 
I could hear music swelling 
over the distant festival tents 
and gurgles of beer from a 
tap, willing me to join the fun. 
Later, regrouped at last with 
my summer roommates, I 
posed for a picture in my race 
bib, a banana in one hand and 
a complimentary can of Coors 
Light in the other. My caption 
on Instagram read, “Post-race 
carbo load at its finest.”

It’s no secret that working 

out hard tends to warrant 
celebration. My race was 
just one among thousands 
of running events that offer 
drinks at the finish line — and 
I’m not just talking Gatorade. 
Disney’s Wine-and-Dine Half 
Marathon ends at the Epcot 
International Food and Wine 
Festival; a new 10K race in 
the U.K. offers wine instead 
of water at rest stops, with 
full bottles available for 
purchase at the finish. And 
then there’s the Marathon du 
Médoc in French wine country, 
the mackdaddy of party 
races, in which participants 
are encouraged to drink 23 
different glasses of wine and 
sample cheese, oysters, foie 
gras and ice cream — all while 
somehow finishing 26.2 miles.

Marathon du Médoc’s goal? 

To make a running event 
that combines “wine, sports, 
fun and health.” And if trend 

predictions are accurate, this 
unlikely combination of health 
and indulgence may soon be 
more common than you think. 

“Healthonism,” a term 

coined by J. Walter Thompson 
Intelligence, was featured in 
December on The Future 100, 
a list of top trends to watch for 
in 2016. Fox News describes 
the healthonism trend as such: 
“health-conscious millennials 
are offsetting consumption of 
alcohol with antioxidants and 
healthy mixers — mashing up 
exercise with hedonism, and 
flocking to a growing number 
of exercise-meets-drinking 
events.”

Hedonism, a lifestyle most 

associated with the wealthy 
men of leisure in 17th century 
England (think Oscar Wilde’s 
“Picture of Dorian Gray”), 
isn’t as antiquated as it sounds: 
hedonists simply pursue a life 
of pleasure and experiences, 
rather than obeying structured 
rules of society. So a modern 
hedonist may be a high school 
student who chooses to travel 
indefinitely instead of going 
to college, or a celebrity who 
spends a fortune on plastic 
surgery but donates nothing 
to charity. “Healthonism” is 
similar in that healthonists 
also seek out the good life — 
refusing to miss out on a party 
or pass up a drink — but they 
do so in a health-conscious 
way. Healthonists don’t just 
party; they get crunk after 
completing a marathon, a 
group bike ride or a Bikram 
yoga session. Similarly, 
healthonists don’t just drink; 
they imbibe on cocktails with 
cold-pressed organic juices, 
like Hotamelon Tequila 
Cleanse and RaspberryAddict 
Vodka Cleanse from the brand 
CleanDrinking.

Healthonists eat well, work 

out hard and play even harder. 
Basically, good health is their 
utmost priority — until they’re 
undermining it.

Mixing alcohol and an active 

lifestyle, or really any healthy 
lifestyle, has been an obvious 
no-no for years. Though 
there are reported benefits 
of drinking moderately — 
the Mediterranean Diet, 

recommended for Americans 
by the 2016 Dietary Guidelines, 
includes a daily glass of wine 
— most doctors and exercise 
scientists agree that if you 
must drink, one to two glasses 
is the maximum you should 
have. Going past this limit, 
especially for active people, 
can wreak havoc on your 
health. Alcohol lowers your 
blood sugar, making you crave 
sweet and fatty foods; disrupts 
sleep patterns, impeding 
recovery; and it packs on 
pounds, as boozy calories have 
zero nutritional value.

Despite these negative 

consequences, athletes still 
drink. And they drink even 
more on days when they 
exercise the most, according 
to a recent article in CNN. 
Scientists have speculated a 
few reasons why particularly 
strenuous workouts (or races) 
inspire people to drink: there’s 
the “celebration factor,” when 
teams to want celebrate after 
a big win or runners regroup 
at a bar for post-long run 
beers; there’s also the guilt 
factor, perhaps more common, 
when athletes plan an intense 
workout before a big night out 
with friends.

Case in point: New Year’s 

Eve at the gym. I was there 
with the rest of my hometown 
this past December, getting my 
weight lifting in before the big 
night, when our family friend 
shouted up to me from his 
elliptical: “Gotta burn off all 
those beer calories!”

I’d like to say that I don’t do 

this, that I’m not a healthonist. 
Yet I find myself planning my 
longest run of the week the 
morning before going out that 
night; and if you asked whether 
I stick to lean chicken, veggies 
and water as a post-race 
recovery meal, I’d probably 
laugh. (For the record, my 
go-tos are ice cream and wine.)

Am I hurting my health 

by celebrating occasionally? 
Maybe a little. But you can bet 
that if I didn’t have a concert 
ticket and beer mug calling my 
name in the Musikfest race this 
summer, I wouldn’t have ran as 
hard or as fast as I did. A little 
motivation never hurt anybody, 
as long as the celebration is 
kept in moderation. Let’s raise 
a cold-pressed juice cocktail 
to that.

wine and cheese platter after her 

daily five mile run. To ask how 

you too can enjoy this lifestyle,

Successful superhero 
portrayal on The CW

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Senior Arts Editor

The latest spinoff of The CW’s 

lucrative superhero franchise, 
“DC’s Legends of Tomorrow,” 
has a lot of 
problems 
to 

overcome 
in 

its 
two-part 

premiere, 
and it doesn’t 
make 
it 

through with-
out stumbling. 
Still, by the 
end of its sec-
ond hour, the 
show 
estab-

lishes itself as 
potentially 
a 

very promising addition to the 
superhero genre.

“DC’s Legends of Tomorrow” 

brings together minor char-
acters from “Arrow” and “The 
Flash” to form an Avengers-like 
team of heroes. The leader is Rip 
Hunter (Arthur Darvill, “Doc-
tor Who”), a time traveler who 
assembles the team, like Nick 
Fury from the Avengers mixed 
with the Doctor from “Doctor 
Who.” Rip picks Ray “The Atom” 
Palmer (Brandon Routh, “Super-
man 
Returns”), 
resurrected 

assassin Sara “White Canary” 
Lance (Caity Lotz, “Mad Men”), 
supervillains 
Leonard 
“Cap-

tain Cold” Snart and Mick 
“Heat Wave” Rory (Wentworth 
Miller and Dominic Purcell 
from “Prison Break”), nuclear 
physicist Martin Stein (Vic-
tor Garber, “Argo”) and former 
high school athlete Jefferson 
Jackson (Franz Drameh, “Edge 
of Tomorrow”), the last two of 
whom fuse together to form the 
Human Torch-esque Firestorm. 
There’s also Kendra “Hawk-
girl” Saunders (Ciara Renée, 
“Big Fish” the musical) and 
Carter “Hawkman” Hall (Falk 
Hentschel, “StreetDance 2”), a 
reincarnated ancient Egyptian 

princess and prince. Rip explains 
to the team that they must travel 
through time to find and defeat 
the immortal Vandal Savage 
(Casper Crump, “Helium”), pre-
venting the fall of civilization 100 
years into the future.

That’s a lot of exposition to 

dole out over the course of a pilot, 
especially with 10 major char-
acters, and “Legends” doesn’t 
quite manage to do it without 
feeling clunky. There are a lot of 
requisite expositional lines with 
characters blatantly stating their 
identities as if introducing them-
selves to the camera.

The show also makes some 

unwise moves in characteriza-
tion. Snart’s cartoony anti-hero 
persona (aided by Miller’s hilari-
ous line readings) and Sara’s sim-
ple desire to have fun in whatever 
time period she’s in make them 
early standouts, but other char-
acters don’t leave as much of an 
impression. Despite the show’s 
insistence that Vandal Savage 
is a terrifying threat, Crump 
doesn’t have the dark charisma 
or coldblooded stare that made 
Slade Wilson (Manu Bennett, 
“Spartacus”) and Damien Darhk 
(Neal 
McDonough, 
“Desper-

ate Housewives”) such compel-
ling villains in “Arrow.” Worse, 
Kendra and Carter immediately 
drain life from every scene they 
enter, a problem when a big part 
of the plot depends on their age-
old battle with Savage. And while 
Garber is great as Martin Stein, 
Stein gives a bad first impression 
when he drugs and kidnaps Jack-
son to force him to join the team 
on their first time-traveling mis-
sion.

Plots based around time trav-

eling can be irresistible when 
they’re mapped out logically, but 
sometimes the plot of “Legends” 
requires you to ignore glaring 
inconsistencies. 
For 
example, 

after Savage gets a hold of future 
tech and as a result catastrophe 
happens in 2016, Rip insists that 

this is only a projection of the 
future; time is like cement, and 
it won’t be set in stone until Sav-
age, in the 1975 timeline, manages 
to reverse-engineer the future 
tech. By itself this logic makes a 
sort of “squint and it kind of fol-
lows” sense, but it doesn’t match 
up with the show’s established 
premise. The team’s whole jour-
ney is predicated on the fact that 
time isn’t like cement; it’s more 
like water, malleable and not 
gradually hardening.

These problems seem sig-

nificant enough to derail a typi-
cal time travel series, but it’s 
remarkable how much you can 
overlook if something is really 
fun, and “Legends of Tomor-
row” is certainly fun. It might 
make no sense to have Mar-
tin Stein meet his younger self 
in 1975 and for the timeline to 
remain completely unchanged, 
but damn is it fun to watch. In 
terms of entertainment, a team 
of snarky superheroes traveling 
through time is a recipe for suc-
cess.

The second episode is also a 

vast improvement over the first, 
with far less clumsy exposition 
to deliver. It also smartly varies 
the character dynamics, sending 
Ray, Snart and Mick out to steal 
something while Stein hangs 
out with Sara, Jefferson and 
his younger self. Unfortunately, 
Kendra and Carter are still rel-
egated to their own boring sub-
plot, though the conclusion of 
the episode hints that Carter’s 
role will be smaller in upcoming 
episodes.

“DC’s Legends of Tomorrow” 

may stumble a bit in its two-part 
pilot, but when it comes down to 
it, both episodes are entertaining 
throughout, and when you have a 
couple boring characters in a cast 
of 10, the problems aren’t glaring. 
If the series continues to focus on 
the moments of giddy time travel 
fun, it’ll be a more than worthy 
addition to the CW Arrowverse.

Come ‘Closer’

By MARIA ROBINS

Daily Arts Writer

“Love bores you,” one charac-

ter accuses another. “No, it disap-
points me,” the other responds. 
Patrick Marber’s 
“Closer” 
skips 

syrupy-sweet 
implications 
to 

engage with the 
underbelly 
of 

romance. 
The 

close-up look at 
intimacy 
gone 

wrong is more 
relatable 
than 

we’d often like to 
admit.

School 
of 

Music, Theatre 
& Dance senior 
David 
Barnes 

makes his direc-
torial debut with “Closer,” and in it 
he allows the audience to come face 
to face with shame, deceit and the 
disappointment of falling in and 
out of love through vignettes that 
peek into the lives of four individu-
als. First performed in London in 
1997, “Closer” centers on the inter-
twined love lives of two men and 
two women in a way that is hardly 
romantic. It is peppered with deci-

sions that show desperation and 
questionable moral character in the 
pursuit of meaningful intimacy.

The production, backed by stu-

dent organization Basement Arts, 
focuses on a minimal design while 
tackling complex and sophisticated 
emotional content. The cast con-
sists of four actors, and the set is 
little more than a table and couple 
chairs.

“What’s nice about this play is 

that it kind of skips all of the lovey-
dovey every day romantic life and 
just goes from ultimate romance to 
catastrophic disaster, which is real-
ly exciting for the actors because 
you’re not doing anything but highs 
and lows the whole time,” Barnes 
said.

The show is honest and unfil-

tered in a way that was controver-
sial at its outset. Barnes said theater 
was a fitting medium for its darker 
storylines.

“I think it’s a very relatable show. 

I think a lot of theater accents the 
reality of humanity and kind of digs 
into the dark sides of people, but 
this show kind of takes it to another 
level, which is why when it came 
out in ’97 it was so shocking,” he 
said. “It’s certainly less shocking 
now, but it explores people doing 
shitty things, doing things they 

shouldn’t do, doing things that we 
— as society — frown upon, which 
is so interesting because we all do 
stuff like that. We just kind of shove 
it under the rug.” 

Although, as audience members, 

it is challenging to parse where our 
sympathies ought to lie, Barnes 
suggests that the intention of the 
play is not to feel sorry for the char-
acters, but rather understand their 
motives and rationale for behavior 
that has harmful consequences.

“Everyone 
cheats; 
everyone 

lies; everyone is kind of horrible 
to each other, but with good rea-
son,” Barnes said. “I don’t need the 
audience to like these characters. 
I just need them to understand 
them, because all of the things 
we’re doing are things we’ve done 
or we would do if we were in the 
situation, we just tell ourselves we 
wouldn’t.”

“Closer” lives up to its title in 

the decision to present on a “thrust 
stage,” which essentially means 
that there is no backstage and the 
stage is surrounded by the audience 
on three sides.

“Doing it in the thrust is really 

exciting because it kind of literally 
thrusts the actors into the audience 
... the show is very aware that it’s 
theater,” Barnes said.

Because the style and form of the 

play is so intimate and bare-boned, 
the scenes require comprehensive 
and meticulous text work, some-
thing that a small cast generously 
lends itself to.

“With a small cast I can spend 

an hour with two people working 
on 15 lines and really dig into it and 
really figure out what’s working, 
what’s not, why they do every-
thing,” Barnes said.

I saw him do exactly this during a 

rehearsal in which two characters, 
Anna and Dan, discuss the muddy 
terms of their relationship in a res-
taurant. During the scene, Barnes 
urged the actors to search for inten-
tion and purpose behind even the 
most seemingly small moments. 
Everything from an entrance to a 
moment of eye contact to an “I’m 
not hungry” is probed and replayed 
to further convey the emotional 
and psychological complexity of 
the interpersonal dynamics at play. 
 

Barnes asks the actors questions 

like “How does it feel that the per-
fect woman is no longer perfect?” 
and asks them to pinpoint moments 
of realization that may not be vocal-
ized, but rather expressed through 
subtlety of facial expression or 
body language.

Barnes explains the process of 

creating “Closer” as one that com-
bines creativity with self-reflection 
to create multidimensional charac-
ters.

“A lot of it is just using your imag-

ination or personal experience and 
putting yourself in the mindset of 
where these characters would be,” 
Barnes said. “Like, ‘What would 
happen if the love of your life sud-
denly walked out the door?’ We talk 
about that, we let that simmer.”

‘Lucifer’ ascends 

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

In the Bible, the devil is 

described as a red-colored, horned 
being with a pitchfork and a malev-
olent spirit. But 
in pop culture, 
the 
devil 
has 

taken on many 
more distinctive 
appearances. Al 
Pacino 
played 

Satan disguised 
as the evil head 
of a law firm in 
the 1997 thriller 
“The 
Devil’s 

Advocate.” 
Actor and comedian Jason Sudei-
kis parodied the Biblical figure in 
several Weekend Update segments 
on “Saturday Night Live,” wear-
ing a cartoonishly bright red devil 
outfit and talking about invent-
ing every terrible attribute of the 
Internet. In the 2013 apocalyptic 
comedy “This Is The End,” the 
devil was depicted as a gigantic, 
CGI demon that butt-fucked Jonah 
Hill. This year, the devil is once 
again taking a new form, this time 
as a womanizing British nightclub 
owner named Lucifer Morningstar 
(Tom Ellis, “Miranda”) in FOX’s 
mystical crime dramedy “Luci-
fer.” And it may just be the best on 
screen portrayal of the devil yet. 

Adapted from the character of 

the DC Comics series “The Sand-
man,” “Lucifer” transcends its 
familiar police procedural for-
mat by employing sleek visuals, a 
charismatic lead and stylish pro-
duction values. Bored with ruling 
the underworld, Lucifer decides 
to live in Los Angeles (the “City 

of Angels,” get it?) and success-
fully manages an upscale night-
life hotspot called Lux. But after 
witnessing the death of his close 
friend, beloved pop star Deli-
lah (AnnaLynne McCord, “Nip/
Tuck”), Lucifer seeks to punish 
her killers — as well as the rest of 
the human scum on Earth — with 
the help of LAPD Detective Chloe 
Decker (Lauren German, “Chi-
cago Fire”). The premise sounds 
very conventional and somewhat 
derivative, but given its comic 
book roots, “Lucifer” is bound to 
boast some enthralling material.

Though most of the script is 

bland, there are some moments 
of captivating dialogue, espe-
cially with Lucifer and Detective 
Decker. The two have a fun banter 
and the sexual tension between 
them is evident, but what’s even 
more alluring about their rela-
tionship is how Decker is immune 
to Lucifer’s telepathic ability of 
uncovering 
people’s 
deepest, 

darkest secrets. This is what 
keeps Lucifer — and the audience 
— intrigued, and it’s arguably the 
strongest aspect of the series thus 
far. “Lucifer” ’s incredible alt-rock 
soundtrack is also surprisingly 
apt for the show; it includes songs 
like Beck’s “Devil’s Haircut,” Cage 
the Elephant’s “Ain’t No Rest for 
the Wicked” and The Black Keys’s 
“Sinister Kid.”

At times, however, “Lucifer” can 

be scattershot and tonally uneven. 
The camera captures some beau-
tiful shots with unconventional 
angles, but the choppy editing 
stagnates the show’s pacing. Addi-
tionally, the show doesn’t seem 
so sure of what genre it wants to 
stick with; it shifts uncomfortably 

from comedy to thriller to drama. 
While Ellis makes a few clever, 
snarky quips, some of the suppos-
edly “funny” parts of the show are 
cringeworthy, particularly in the 
scene in which Lucifer seduces 
Delilah’s therapist Linda (Rachael 
Harris, “Suits”). Unfortunately, the 
action sequences aren’t spectacu-
lar either and far from thrilling, as 
they utilize the slow-motion effect 
to a fault.

But unlike other darker and 

sillier versions of the Devil in TV 
and film, “Lucifer” and its pro-
tagonist are much more developed. 
Ellis brings both the sex appeal 
and pathos for a character who’s 
a notoriously cruel, unforgiving 
force against the most sinful and 
depraved of people. He’s similar to 
David Tennant’s sinister Kilgrave 
from Netflix’s “Jessica Jones,” 
except with a little bit more empa-
thy and likability. Underneath 
Lucifer’s smug confidence (he’s 
immortal, after all), his sympathy 
for Decker and refusal to live in 
the underworld again give him an 
emotional edge. Even the striking 
Lauren German brings energy and 
skill to her role as Detective Deck-
er, which could have been another 
cookie-cutter cop sidekick.

Considering its genre and con-

tent, “Lucifer” may draw compari-
sons to other supernatural/crime 
TV shows, like the CW’s “iZom-
bie” or FOX’s “Sleepy Hollow.” 
When juxtaposed with the light-
hearted cleverness of “iZombie” or 
dark aesthetics of “Sleepy Hollow,” 
“Lucifer” is a second-rate program. 
But once it learns to find its footing, 
“Lucifer” can hopefully join the 
high ranks of those two shows and 
the rest of television programming.

‘Hours’ falters, sinks

FILM REVIEW

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

Daily Arts Writer

The moment I realized that I 

wanted to be captivated by some-
thing other than Chris Pine’s allur-
ing blue eyes, I knew something 
was 
terribly 

wrong. This is 
not to say that 
the true story 
behind 
“The 

Finest Hours” 
isn’t 
compel-

ling, but more 
that it is sadly 
submerged.

“The Finest 

Hours” depicts 
four U.S. Coast 
Guard members braving a treach-
erous storm to save 32 men strand-
ed off the Massachusetts coast on 
The SS Pendleton, an oil tanker 
split in half by the raging waves. 
The painfully slow exposition 
establishes the romance between 
Coast Guard captain Bernie Web-
ber (Chris Pine, “Supermansion”) 
and Miriam (Holliday Grainger, 
“Lady Chatterley’s Lover”). Once 
the USCG crew finally gets on the 
water, the pace speeds up nicely, 
bouncing between scenes featur-
ing the Pendleton’s engineer, Ray 
Sybert (Casey Affleck, “Inter-
stellar”) and Webber aboard the 
CG-36500 rescue boat. Both have 
their foibles: Webber too strictly 
adheres to the rules, and Syb-
ert’s got this intense fear of being 
authoritative. Needless to say, no 
one actually expects either to suc-
ceed except Sybert’s father and 
Miriam, but that’s what makes the 
happy ending all the more satisfy-
ing.

Visually, it’s a decently stunning 

maritime film. The camera move-
ments are sleek but still give the 
effect of a ship violently tumbling 

in the waves. All too soon, these 
once impressive shots and com-
puter graphics become nettle-
some. There’s an extremely clever 
shot where the camera acts as a 
messenger, following a command 
as it’s passed along from the ship’s 
top to bottom. Just a few scenes 
later, the motion is repeated. 
Cinematographer Javier Aguir-
resarobe also relies too heavily on 
placing the camera in the wind-
shield and front facing window 
of the CG-36500 in an attempt to 
make viewers feel like they’re rid-
ing along with the characters. 

Pine and Affleck both give com-

mendable performances. Their 
subtlety adds a sense of realism; 
they recognize that the men did 
it for the greater good because it 
was their duty, not because they 
foresaw their efforts displayed on 
the big screen. Moments focused 
on these two strictly executing 
their missions are what keep the 
film afloat, as they temporar-
ily provide the true story (with a 
lifejacket, of sorts). Unfortunately, 
just as the desired story begins to 
surface, it’s deluged with murky 
subplots.

Most annoying is the romantic 

one. If its purpose is to help create 
pathos for Webber, it was redun-
dant — Pine’s natural charisma 
and ’50s drawl already accom-
plish that. Furthermore, the epi-
sodes of Miriam disrespectfully 
talking to Webber’s superiors and 
inappropriately acting like she’s 
the only person who will suffer 
if the CG-36500 doesn’t return 
bog down the film, only serving 
to increase our yearning for the 
historic rescue sequence. Her pid-
dling struggles, like her car gen-
tly sliding into a snow bank and 
losing her coat for a few minutes, 
seem utterly inappropriate.

Then there’s the abundance 

of archetypes, starting with the 
flawed hero. I don’t know if the 
real Bernie Webber actually had a 
tragic rescue mission before Pend-
leton, but it’s distracting in the 
film, especially when it’s frequent-
ly addressed yet skimpily devel-
oped. Both crews are composed of 
tropes: the Pendleton consists of 
the cheery, singing chef, the scared 
youngster, the rough old man and 
the pugnacious man who revels in 
making life difficult for everyone 
else. Webber’s team doesn’t appear 
much better: there’s the inexperi-
enced ship maintenance man, the 
man who holds a grudge against 
Webber for his previous mission 
and the amiable team player.

This profusion of tropes coupled 

with the overbearing romance 
sink the film into a sea of predict-
ability. Of course the fearful deck-
hand must take a valiant leap of 
faith, and something unfortunate 
happens to the jolly old chef. All 
the romantic buildup caused me 
to anticipate Miriam acting as the 
light (both literally and figura-
tively) that guides Webber home 
far earlier than I wanted to.

As this aforementioned end-

ing approached, everyone in the 
audience started gathering their 
belongings, and one gentleman 
had already meandered into the 
aisle. Then, side-by-side photos 
of the cast and those they por-
trayed slowly graced the screen. 
Written text accompanied the 
images, succinctly explaining the 
characters’ lives after the historic 
event. All the hustle and bustle 
in the theater suddenly subsided 
and the man returned to his seat, 
intrigued. When the lights flick-
ered on, everyone remained seat-
ed, eloquently demonstrating the 
fascination with real people and 
true stories, not the superficial rec-
reation.

ALBUM REVIEW
Sia shines on ‘Acting’ 

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Even after a nearly 20-year long 

music career, Sia Furler is just 
starting to become a pop sensa-

tion. Before she released her first 
successful solo hit “Chandelier” 
and concealed her face from the 
public 
with 

her 
signature 

black-and-
blonde wig in 
2014, Sia was 
just an indie 
songstress, 
writing tracks 
for 
Christina 

Aguilera 
and 

singing 
lead 

vocals for acid jazz outfit Zero 
7. She had released five solo 
records, two of which made the 
U.S. Billboard 200 but failed 
to reach acclaim. However, her 
sixth album, 2014’s underrated, 
chart-topping 1000 Forms of Fear, 
paved the way for Sia not just as a 
songwriter but as an experienced 
musician making her way to the 
top. With her newest record This 
is Acting, Sia is embracing this 
newfound superstardom while 
retaining her deft songwriting 
abilities with 12 vigorous tracks.

Many of the tracks off This is 

Acting were intended for other 
musicians, but Sia hones her 
groundbreaking vocals and maxi-
malist production to transform 
each song as if it were her own. 
1000 Forms of Fear reflected the 
pain and loneliness of Sia’s past 
experiences 
with 
depression, 

alcoholism and drug abuse. In 
contrast, This is Acting boasts 
an overarching optimism that 
sounds both authentic and liber-
ating. On the piano-laden opener 
“Bird Set Free,” Sia howls, “And 
I don’t care if I sing off key / I 
find myself in my melodies.” It 
sounds corny, sure, but with the 
Australian singer’s impeccable 
vocal range, it’s impossible to not 
get chills. The record’s recur-
ring theme of persistence against 
adversity continues in “Alive,” 
another spine-tingling ballad and 
“Unstoppable,” an empowering 
confidence booster perfect for 
exercising at the gym or a random 
dance party in your bedroom.

Greg Kurstin — Kelly Clark-

son collaborator and renowned 
pop producer — provides the 
infectious beats of the ecstatic 
“Move Your Body,” the dancehall-
infused “Cheap Thrills” and the 
hip-hop heavy “Sweet Design” 
— arguably the album’s strongest 
track. Of course, there are some 
bumps in the road, particularly 

with the middling throwaway 
“Footprints” and the sluggish “One 
Million Bullets,” which ironically 
was the only song on This is Act-
ing not intended for another art-
ist. Yet even on songs that fall flat, 
Sia manages to add some flavor 
using her powerhouse of a voice. 
“Reaper” suffers from being a for-
mulaic ballad, but regains some 
energy through Kanye West’s 
production. The synth-pop jam 
“House on Fire” is lukewarm, 
until Sia soars when the chorus 
hits and the production switch-
es from tepid to sparkly. The 
heart-wrenching 
penultimate 

track “Broken Glass” starts out 
bland, but Sia’s two powerful 
key changes save the song from 
sounding stationary. Sia briefly 
returns to a place of brokenness 
and despair on the album closer 
“Space Between.” But instead of 
regressing into pessimism, Sia 
sounds more emancipated than 
ever.

It’s interesting to think about 

what these songs could have 
sounded like had they been 
recorded by their original per-
formers. “Bird Set Free” had 
been rejected three times, first 
by “Pitch Perfect 2” producers 
(who favored Jessie J’s anthem 
“Flashlight”), then by Rihanna 
and finally by Adele. “Alive” was 
also initially intended for Adele’s 
25, but didn’t make the cut, even 
though Sia co-wrote the song 
with Adele and indie pop art-
ist Tobias Jesso Jr. Rihanna also 
rejected “Cheap Thrills” and 
“Reaper.” Some sources specu-
lated “Unstoppable” was meant 
for Demi Lovato’s Confident, 
another pop record that, like 
Sia’s, channeled happiness and 
buoyancy while escaping past 
negative experiences. Regardless 
of how these songs could have 
sounded, Sia crafts This is Acting 
so meticulously and effortlessly 
that you forget about what could 
have been.

With the right balance of elec-

tric club bangers and poignant 
power ballads, This is Acting hits 
the ground running at lightspeed 
and doesn’t stop until the very 
end. For those who think Sia 
reached her peak with “Chan-
delier,” you could not be more 
wrong. At 40 years old, Sia is just 
getting started, and This is Act-
ing proves that she still has some 
tricks up her sleeve.

Michigan wrestling trio has gridiron history

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

The gridiron is not the only 

place where Michigan has brought 
in highly touted prospects lately.

In 
2013, 
the 
Michigan 

wrestling team hauled in the No. 
1 recruiting class in the country. 
Now juniors, that class has buoyed 
the Wolverines (5-1 Big Ten, 10-2 
overall) to their current No. 8 
ranking. Domenic Abounader and 
Adam Coon are undefeated in dual 
meets, and fellow junior Brian 
Murphy, 157 pounds, is ranked 
ninth in the country.

But before the group dominated 

on the mat, they all shined 
in another sport, too. Coon, 
Abounader and Murphy all were 
stars on the gridiron in high school.

***

Coon — a 6-foot-5, 250-pound 

heavyweight— was sought after by 
fairly high-profile schools in both 
sports at the collegiate level.

His football offers included 

Michigan State, Wisconsin and 
Northwestern. All three squads 
finished in the Associated Press 
Top 25 in 2015 and posted a 
combined record of 32-7.

The schools were enamored 

by the fact that Coon was a two-
way starter for the Fowlerville 
(Michigan) High School football 
team — linebacker and offensive 
lineman. He earned All-State 
honors in 2012 for his linebacker 
play and was voted All-Livingston 
County Defensive Player of the 
Year in 2012.

“I went up to the varsity coach 

as an eighth grader and told him ‘I 
want to play varsity,’ ” Coon said. 
“He kind of laughed it off a bit, but 
when he saw that I was serious, he 
started thinking about it a little 
bit. I went to a couple of training 
camps and showed that I was 
deserving of a varsity spot and a 
starting job (the next season).”

Coon, for his part, was always a 

fan of the Big Ten’s “smashmouth” 
style of play, predicated on strong 
offensive and defensive lines.

“It 
doesn’t 
matter 
what 

people say, football is won in the 
trenches,” Coon said.

But 
all 
of 
that 
paled 

in 
comparison 
to 
his 

accomplishments in wrestling.

He posted a 212-3 dual-meet 

record in high school, including 
three straight years without a 
loss. He was an individual state 
champion all four years and was 
named both the 2013 Detroit 
Athletic Club High School Athlete 
of the Year and Michigan’s “Mr. 
Wrestler.” 
These 
accolades 

made him the No. 1 heavyweight 
wrestling prospect and the No. 2 
overall wrestling prospect in 2013.

As if all of that weren’t enough, 

Coon finished second in the 
MSHAA discus and shot put 
events for track and field.

“Track was my more laid-back 

sport,” Coon said. “It wasn’t as 
grueling as football and wrestling. 
But a lot of football players will 
take ballet to work on their foot 
movements. 
Discus 
was 
my 

ballet.”

Ultimately, 
academics, 
a 

dedicated coaching staff and the 
desire to remain close to his mother 
and his father, who was his high 
school wrestling coach, convinced 
Coon to join the Wolverines.

“I came down (to Ann Arbor) 

for a workout with the Cliff Keen 
Wrestling Club one day, and the 
coaches laid down a plan for me,” 
Coon said. “They said, ‘We have 
a great lifting program, we have 
a great engineering program.’ It 
wasn’t just about the next four 
or five years, it was long term. 
Showing that level of commitment 
showed me that this place really 
wants me.”

Yet, Coon still holds on to his 

dream of playing in the NFL. 
That is, after he wrestles in the 
Olympics and before he attempts 

to become an astronaut, as he is 
enrolled in Michigan’s aerospace 
engineering program.

“(Being an astronaut) is one of 

those dreams every little kid has,” 
Coon said. “I never really grew out 
of it. That’s kind of the reason I’m 
in the aerospace program, to get 
my foot in the door.”

***

While Abounader did not get 

the football recruiting offers Coon 
got, he still managed a strong 
career as a safety for St. Edwards 
(Ohio) High School.

As team captain his senior year, 

he led the Eagles to an undefeated 
regular-season 
record 
before 

being upset, 63-56, by Mentor 
in the second round of the Ohio 
Division I playoffs. Abounader 
was 
selected 
All-State 
First 

Team that season. His former 
coach, Rick Fenotti, is now the 
director of football operations at 
Michigan.

But 
it 
was 
Abounader’s 

wrestling that put him on the map 
of collegiate scouts. He compiled 
a 135-8 career record in high 
school, won all 36 of his matches 
his senior year and was a three-
time state champion. He was the 
No. 1 184-pound recruit and No. 
11 overall in 2013. A desire to stay 
relatively close to home compelled 
him to choose Michigan over 
Virginia and Virginia Tech.

“(Being a multi-sport athlete) 

worked because football season 
bled right into wrestling season,” 
Abounader said. “It kept me from 
getting burned out in any one sport. 
You work on a lot of the same skills, 
especially as a defensive back.”

Despite having to undergo 

knee surgery in 2014, Abounader 
emerged as a force for the 
Wolverines 
shortly 
thereafter. 

He took home the 2015 Big Ten 
individual title at 184 pounds; 
Michigan’s 
first 
individual 

championship in three years.

“(The 
surgery) 
was 

disappointing because I had a 
really good summer,” Abounader 
said. “I have two years left (at 
Michigan), and I want to make the 
most of them.”

***

In 
contrast 
to 
Abounader 

and Coon, Murphy excelled at 
quarterback in his high school 
days.

While he averaged more than 

100 yards passing per game as 
Glenbard North (Illinois) High 
School’s starting signal-caller, he 
was also a threat with his legs, 
making him a smaller version 
of Ohio State’s J.T. Barrett or 
Clemson’s 
Deshaun 
Watson. 

Murphy used these skills to help 
the Black Panthers to playoff runs 
in 2011 and 2012.

Murphy 
did 
not 
want 
to 

compare 
himself 
to 
those 

superstars, however.

“I didn’t have the cannon that 

(Barrett 
and 
Watson) 
have,” 

Murphy said.

Yet he did give a large amount 

credit his teammate, running 
back Justin Jackson, for Glenbard 
North’s success. If Murphy was 
analogous to J.T. Barrett, then 
Jackson played the part of Ezekiel 
Elliott in the Black Panthers’ 
offense. Jackson, who now plays 
for Northwestern, rushed for 6,531 
yards and 85 touchdowns in high 
school.

Due to his size, Murphy knew 

he would have to choose wrestling 
if he was going to extend his 
athletic career into his college 
years.

Not that it would prove an 

issue for him, though. Murphy 
accumulated a 166-14 dual-meet 
record in high school and was 
a four-time Fargo freestyle All-
American. In 2013, he was the 
No. 6 wrestling prospect in the 
country at 157 pounds and was No. 
27 overall. 

It was not an issue for Murphy 

to be a dual-sport athlete. Aside 
from some good-natured ribbing, 
Murphy’s football coach did not 
give him grief if he had to miss 
football practice for something 
such as wrestling nationals, as was 
the case in 2012.

“(Wrestling) 
teaches 
you 

balance and strength and how to 
use different types of strength,” 
Murphy said. “It made me more 
explosive.”

But for all of his success, 

Murphy has one chip on his 
shoulder.

During his time at Glenbard 

North, he came within striking 
distance of either an individual 
wrestling title or a football team 
title in Class 8A six times. He 
never once took home the gold and 
finished runner-up in four of them 
— three times in wrestling (2010-
11, 2011-12 and 2012-13) and once 
in football (2012).

“It stung, especially in my 

wrestling career,” Murphy said. 
“But I think those things help 
you later on in life. Coming out 
of high school, I feel like I didn’t 
accomplish anything and it makes 
me work harder here. I want to 

win something.”

With the Wolverines’ loaded 

roster, both Murphy and the 
Wolverines will be reaching for 
a 
long-coveted 
championship. 

Michigan last won a team Big Ten 
title in 1973 and has never won 
an NCAA title — the Wolverines 
finished runner-up in the 2005 
NCAA Championships.

“It’s a big motivating factor 

for the team and my individual 
goals,” Murphy said. “I think we 
have potential to win a national 
championship, and I think I 
have potential to win a national 
championship. That’s what we are 
striving for.”

***

Michigan wrestling may be 

making headlines as the No. 8 
team in America, for boasting two 
wrestlers who are undefeated in 
dual play and topping defending 
national champion Ohio State in 
Columbus.

But in the Wolverines’ spare 

time, they could also make a fairly 
formidable football team. Just 
don’t challenge them to a pick-up 
game.

Merchant talks 
recruiting, goals

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team is coming off a 
home win against Minnesota and 
will look to 
develop 
a 

win streak 
with 
a 

victory 
against 
No. 
17 

Michigan 
State. The Wolverines beat the 
Spartans twice in the regular 
season last year, but fell to them 
in the Big Ten Tournament. 
With Michigan State’s roster 
revitalized 
and 
healthy, 

Michigan will face an uphill 
battle when it heads to East 
Lansing on Wednesday.

The Daily sat down with 

Spartan coach Suzy Merchant 
at Big Ten Media Day in October 
to talk about her ties to the 
in-state rivalry, new challenges 
in recruiting and what makes the 
2015-16 season unique.

The Michigan Daily: The 

Michigan and Michigan State 
rivalry has been heating up, 
especially in women’s basketball 
as of late. What do you think the 
state of the rivalry is right now?

Suzy Merchant: It’s definitely 

a healthy rivalry. There’s a 
tremendous amount of respect 
between each program. But come 
Michigan game day, and I’m sure 
they feel the same way, there’s 
a different level of intensity and 
competitiveness that comes out.

TMD: 
You 
grew 
up 
in 

Michigan and played basketball 
at Central Michigan. Where 
did you and your family lie on 
the 
Michigan-Michigan 
State 

rivalry?

SM: We’re Spartans. Both of 

my brothers went to Michigan 
State, my younger brother played 
baseball there. I wanted to play 
at Michigan State, but wasn’t 
quite good enough, I guess, to 
play at a major school. Where I 
grew up, where I’m from, there’s 

a lot more Spartans.

TMD: You have a freshman 

from the Czech Republic this 
year. How has the recruiting 
process changed over the years?

SM: The addition of the Big 

Ten Network has really changed 
our recruiting base. The additions 
of 
Rutgers, 
Maryland 
(and) 

Nebraska have opened the door 
to really expand your recruiting 
base, when a lot earlier on, before 
the expansion and before the 
network, I think we were a little 
more regional based with families 
and friends who watch us play. 
But now the door has really been 
opened. We have kids from New 
Jersey, California, the Czech 
Republic, a kid from Martinique 
that’s on our roster that will sit 
this year as an academic redshirt. 
And we have kids from Detroit, so 
it’s a unique blend of kids.

TMD: What have you learned 

from the recruiting process that 
you carry into every year?

SM: I think the recruiting 

process has changed a lot with 
social media. That’s probably 
been 
the 
most 
impactful 

situation, not only as a program 
where people can follow you as 
a fan base, but equally to have 
your recruits follow you, and it 
works vice versa. You have an 
opportunity to see what’s going 
on in their world and connect to 
them in ways we’ve never been 
able to do. That singlehandedly 
has changed everything. There’s 
no private spaces anymore. We 
know every visit they went on, 
who went with them, what time 
they got there, what time they 
left. It’s a lot.

TMD: 
What 
goals 
and 

expectations do you have for your 
team this season?

SM: Ours are always the 

same. We want to win the Big 
Ten first, that’s where you start 
things out, and for us we want to 
push and get an opportunity to 
reach a Final Four and a National 
Championship game. Every year, 
that’s where we start and where 
we want to finish.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
The education of Zach Werenski 

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

It’s 
not 
easy 
being 
Zach 

Werenski.

Sure, 
the 
star 
Michigan 

defender has everything going for 
him. He’s got a lethal combination 
of size and speed, hands of gold 
and a penchant for sniffing out the 
back of the net.

But no player on the roster 

shoulders 
more 
responsibility 

night in and night out.

Werenski is the highest-profile 

player on a defensive unit that 
has taken the brunt of criticism 
for the Wolverines’ shortcomings 
in the last two years. As such, 
the 18-year-old sophomore is the 
cross bearer of a defensive group 
ripe with inexperience — the 
messiah who could lead the way 
to a Frozen Four.

Maybe it’s too much to ask, but 

maybe it’s not.

After 
all, 
the 
National 

Talent Development Program 
product did captain the USA 
team at the IIHF World Junior 
Championships in Finland — the 
most 
prestigious 
tournament 

of its kind. Either way, this is 
the 
position 
Werenski 
finds 

himself in as Michigan rises in 
the rankings, fifth in the USHCO 
poll, despite a 3.13 goals against 
average.

Those expectations are why 

quiet weekends like the most 
recent series against Penn State 
can be alarming. The Wolverines 
scored 13 goals, recording 31 
points, but only one went to 
Werenski.

That’s not to say he played 

poorly. Werenski recorded five 
shots and finished +4 plus/minus 
for the weekend, despite a nagging 
foot injury alluded to by Michigan 
assistant coach Billy Powers.

“I want to play well for my team 

every night, but more importantly 
I want to win,” Werenski said. 
“There’s going to be nights where 
not everyone plays their best.

“I can’t say I’m frustrated if 

we’re winning games.”

The spotlight has followed 

Werenski ever since he took the 
ice for Michigan as a 17-year-
old freshman, completing high 
school in three years. On top of 

the obvious talent, he has earned 
the reputation of a high-IQ player 
among the coaching staff.

“He seeks me out to watch 

video, I don’t have to say, ‘Maybe 
we should watch your shift,’ ” 
Powers said. “It’s Zach coming 
to me. He’s hungry to learn, 
hungry to grow and very, very 
competitive.”

The eager attitude paid off, as 

Werenski recorded 13 goals and 16 
assists in his freshman campaign. 
The success has largely continued 
this year, as the sophomore has 17 
points in 21 games while leading 
a revitalization on the defensive 
end.

“I’ve just been so impressed, 

starting from last year, that a 
young kid could handle everything 
that went on in his world,” Powers 
said. “Last year and then this year 
being the captain of the World 
Junior team.”

But Werenski has been working 

tirelessly on his game his whole 
life, and he isn’t stopping now.

“I wanted to come back here 

to learn as a player, just grow 
my game in all three zones,” 

Werenski said. “The main thing 
is learning and becoming a better 
player. I think I did a good job 
of that in the first half (of the 
season). I think that really showed 
at World Juniors — how good of a 
job Michigan has done developing 
their players.”

Added 
junior 
defenseman 

Michael 
Downing: 
“I 
think 

he’s just gotten a lot smarter 
defensively. Even last year he 
wasn’t bad, but he’s defense-first 
now, that’s what is on his mind. 
The way he approaches the 
game is a lot different now, too. 
I think last year he had a lot of 
stress on him with the draft and 
everything.”

The Grosse Pointe, Mich., 

native 
is 
now 
focused 
on 

improving his physical play in the 
corners, part of a team-wide effort 
to reduce the goals-against before 
the postseason.

“I came in with that as one of 

my goals — to play harder, play 
more physical,” Werenski said. 
“I think I shied away from that 
a little bit after World Juniors. I 
don’t really know the reason for 

that.”

Stretches of sheer brilliance 

like what Werenski accomplished 
at the World Juniors, in which 
he recorded nine points in seven 
games, add to his enigma as a 
player. At times, he dominates 
play in Michigan’s defensive end, 
but in other games he assumes a 
diminished roll.

Turnovers at the blue line and 

giveaways on the offensive rush 
have been largely eliminated as 
the defense grew together this 
season, but it’s still anyone’s guess 
as to whether Werenski can carry 
this unit against a powerhouse 
team like Quinnipiac or Boston 
College.

That 
question 
won’t 
get 

answered until March at the 
earliest, so Werenski will keep 
learning and growing his game. 
Through all the hoopla, the draft, 
the rumors, the allure of the 
NHL, he’s surprised everyone by 
keeping his even keel.

And who knows, maybe that 

is exactly the type of leader 
Michigan needs for a deep run 
this postseason.

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Sophomore defenseman Zach Werenski has 17 points in 21 games this season, building off a strong freshman season.

Hoosiers blow past Michigan

By SIMON KAUFMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

For 
five 
minutes 
Tuesday 

night, the country’s second-best 
shooting team looked like a bunch 
of 
junior-

varsity kids 
who’d 
just 

been 
told 

to suit up for the varsity squad — 
eager to throw up shots without 
any real sense of how to do it.

Indiana took 10 shots in the 

first five minutes of its game 
against 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team (7-3 Big Ten, 17-6 
overall) and made just two. The 
Wolverines, meanwhile, used a 
string of four-straight makes to 
jump out to an early 10-2 lead and 
pushed the margin to as many as 
11 in the first half at Crisler Center.

But then, the script flipped: The 

Hoosiers (9-1, 19-4) looked varsity; 
Michigan 
looked 
elementary. 

Indiana used a 28-0 run that 
stretched from the 9:05 mark in 
the first half to the 18:36 mark in 
the second to cruise to an 80-67 
win.

In the first five minutes, 

it looked like the stars might 
align 
and 
the 
Wolverines 

might pull off an upset over 
the 22nd-ranked Hoosiers. But 
Michigan’s stars faded, and 
Indiana needed only one star 
— senior guard Yogi Ferrell 
— who shined bright enough 
to guide the Hoosiers to their 
conference-best 
ninth 
win. 

Ferrell went 6-for-10 from the 
field and finished with a game-
high 17 points and nine assists to 
help pace an Indiana team that 
likes to move the ball quickly 
in transition. It’s the fifth time 
in six career games against the 
Wolverines that Ferrell has put 
up at least 14 against the maize 
and blue.

“It’s a flow sport. You don’t 

have a chance to huddle up all the 
time,” said Michigan coach John 
Beilein. “So we had some open 
shots, we missed them. They’re 
tremendous in transition. Like 

I said, Yogi Ferrell is as good a 
point guard as there is, because he 
can shoot off the bounce, he finds 
people, he’s playing team ball and 
they’ve got shooters everywhere.”

The 
Hoosiers 
finished 
50 

percent from the field.

But 
still, 
early 
on, 
the 

Wolverines 
looked 
like 
they 

could hang. With nine minutes 
left in the first frame, Michigan 
redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 

Duncan Robinson knocked down 
his second 3-pointer of the night 
to give Michigan a 24-20 lead. 
It would be the last basket the 
Wolverines would make until 
90 seconds into the second half, 
when Robinson hit a jumper to 
end a 10-minute scoring drought.

When 
Michigan 
stopped 

scoring, Indiana was just getting 
started and couldn’t miss. In the 
final 10 minutes of the first half, 
the Hoosiers went 12-for-15 from 
the field, including three made 

3s with less than two minutes 
left in the frame. Michigan’s one-
time lead disappeared faster than 
Donald Trump’s lead in Iowa did 
Monday night, and the Hoosiers 
headed into the locker room with 
a safe 45-24 lead.

In the second half, two free 

throws set the tone for the 
formality that was the final 20 
minutes 
of 
play. 
Sophomore 

guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman got fouled early in 
the second half, went to the 
free-throw line and missed both 
tries — continuing Michigan’s 
scoreless streak.

“It’s just draining when you 

have an 11-point lead against 
that team and everything’s going 
well,” said junior forward Zak 
Irvin, who led Michigan with 16 
points, “then just like that (it’s 
gone). Basketball’s a game of runs. 
A (28-0) run, that’s something 
that none of us saw coming.”

Indiana 
eventually 
cooled 

off — making just one of its first 
five shots of the second frame 
— but its first-half run was too 
great for Michigan to overcome, 
despite finding its touch in the 
second half. The Wolverines shot 
60 percent in the frame, but the 
most they could cut the Hoosiers’ 
lead to was 13 points, and even 
that came just seconds before the 
final buzzer sounded. 

After the game, Irvin and 

Robinson mentioned a lack of 
mental toughness as a reason for 
the loss, but Beilein didn’t buy into 
that. He thought Indiana was just 
better.

“People always throw that out 

there, mental toughness,” Beilein 
said. “Sometimes the other team 
is just damn better than you on 
that night, and I’m not the coach 
who’s going to point fingers at my 
players. We’ve got to get better, 
we’ll find a way.”

Bielfeldt returns

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

Seven 
of 
Max 
Bielfeldt’s 

teammates outscored him Tuesday 
night, and six spent more time on 
the floor. But when Indiana coach 
Tom Crean took the podium to 
address reporters after a beatdown 
far more thorough than the 80-67 
score suggested, Bielfeldt was the 
first player he credited.

“I think, in the first half, Max 

had a plus-25 in the plus-minus,” 
Crean 
said, 
later 
mentioning 

Bielfeldt among a list of seniors 
who have provided his team, which 
has started the season 19-4, with 
“excellent leadership.” 

In layman’s terms: In the 18 

minutes 
Bielfeldt 
played, 
his 

Hoosiers outscored the Michigan 
men’s basketball team by 25.

The performance, however, 

was about far more than simple 
numbers. It was a homecoming 
for Bielfeldt, one that came 
on the heels of a controversial 
departure 
that 
has 
recently 

seen its nastier side bubble back 
toward the surface.

A senior with a year of eligibility 

remaining, Bielfeldt spent 2014-15 
with his status for the following 
season up in the air. He played his 
best basketball in the final stretch 
of 
a 
decidedly 
disappointing 

season, proving himself a capable 
post presence on a team starved 
for experienced big men.

None of it mattered. When 

the dust settled on a chaotic end 
to recruiting season, Michigan 
coach 
John 
Beilein 
had 
a 

scholarship available, yet, when 
push came to shove, Bielfeldt 
found 
himself 
in 
search 
of 

another program to call home.

A column Tuesday in the 

Indianapolis 
Star 
lambasted 

Beilein for the way he handled the 
situation. Beilein said Monday he 
didn’t regret the decision — it was 
one made with the future, not the 
past, in mind. 

Bielfeldt seems to have moved 

on quickly, averaging 8.1 points and 

4.6 rebounds with the Hoosiers. He 
gave Michigan fans a taste, however 
small, of what he could have given 
their team this year, pulling down 
a game-high seven rebounds and 
helping to charge a 28-0 run that 
left the Wolverines flailing.

“Walking down here in the 

visitor’s locker room is weird,” 
Bielfeldt said. ”I got out there, 
and (seeing) all the guys got 
my adrenaline pumping. It was 
definitely a unique experience, 
but I tried to calm down a little 
bit before the game, you know, go 
back to myself. Because I’m not 
the crazy, energetic guy out there 
all the time. I was trying to find 
myself.”

The 
Michigan 
fans 
who 

watched Bielfeldt jog out of the 
opposite tunnel for four years 
made sure his welcome was a 
warm one, giving him a rousing 
ovation as he entered.

Bielfeldt was all business. He 

acknowledged the students with a 
smile and a wave, said his hellos to 
his former teammates and trotted 
across the halfcourt line to warm 
up with the team wearing scarlet — 
a color conspicuously absent from 
his wardrobe throughout his four 
years in Ann Arbor.

The crowd at Crisler Center 

gave Bielfeldt an even lustier cheer 
when he checked into the game 
early in the first half, well before 
the wheels fell off in Michigan’s 
third Big Ten loss this season. 
They didn’t cheer for much longer, 
for Bielfeldt or for the Wolverines, 
who proved incapable of standing 
their ground as Indiana’s lead 
ballooned to 27.

The 
Hoosiers 
were 
well 

prepared for Michigan’s baseline 
cuts, its ball-screen action and the 
rest of its game plan. Among the 
potential concerns for Beilein was 
Bielfeldt’s ability to help game-
plan against a system he played 
in for four years. The fear proved 
legitimate — to an extent.

“I tried to help where I could, 

but it wasn’t extreme,” Bielfeldt 
said. “It was what you’d expect.”

Signing Day primer: Top targets remain for ‘M’

Nation’s No. 1 

recruit Rashan Gary 

still considering 

Wolverines

By ORION SANG 

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 12 Michigan football 

team finished its season on a 
high note, beating No. 25 Florida, 
41-7, in the Citrus Bowl to cap 
a 10-3 season under first-year 
coach Jim Harbaugh.

Wednesday, the Wolverines 

will look to finish strong on the 
recruiting trail as well, with 
several top targets slated to 
announce on National Signing 
Day 
and 
Michigan 
strongly 

in contention for a top-5 class 
nationally.

In what will be Harbaugh’s 

first full recruiting cycle after 
being hired near the end of the 
2015 period, Michigan currently 
has the sixth-best recruiting 
class in the nation, according to 
247Sports.

The list of targets Michigan is 

after has a varied national flavor, 
with players from the Midwest, 
East Coast and West Coast all set 
to decide.

Chief among those prospects 

is Rashan Gary.

Gary is a defensive lineman 

who is ranked as the No. 1 
player in the nation according 
to the 247Sports.com Composite 
Rankings, a system that takes 
the rankings of all four major 
recruiting websites into account 
before creating a holistic list.

He attends the same high 

school, Paramus Catholic, that 
current 
redshirt 
freshmen 

Jabrill 
Peppers 
and 
Juwan 

Bushell-Beatty did.

Michigan 
linebackers 
and 

special 
teams 
coach 
Chris 

Partridge, who was recently 
promoted from director of player 
personnel in recruiting, used to 
be the head coach of Paramus 
Catholic, and the relationship 
between Partridge and Gary has 
often been cited as a key factor in 
Gary’s interest in Michigan.

Gary is the first recruit to 

be ranked No. 1 overall by all 
four major recruiting websites 
since Robert Nkemdiche in 2013 
and would be the highest-rated 
recruit Michigan has signed 
since the debut of the 247Sports 
Composite.

The primary contenders for 

Gary appear to be Michigan, 
Clemson 
— 
where 
Gary 

reportedly took an official visit 
this past weekend — Alabama 
and Ole Miss. According to 
the 247Sports Crystal Ball, 80 
percent of the predictions for 
Gary’s 
final 
destination 
are 

Michigan, as of the time of this 
article.

From his film, it is clear that 

Gary possesses a rare blend of 
power and speed for his size, 
can play all over the defensive 
line and seems like a good bet 
to crack the depth chart of any 
school he chooses.

But Gary isn’t the only highly 

touted 
defensive 
lineman 

Michigan is after.

Boss Tagaloa, the No. 13 

defensive tackle in the nation 
according to 247Sports, will 
also be announcing his decision 
Wednesday.

Tagaloa is from California and 

attends Concord De La Salle, 
the same high school as another 
highly-touted prospect that the 
Wolverines are 
after: 
Devin 

Asiasi.

Asiasi 
is 

rated the No. 
3 tight end in 
the nation by 
247sports, but 
could also be a 
defensive end. 
He’s a bulky 
yet 
athletic 

pass-catcher 
who even took snaps for his 
high school team as a wildcat 
quarterback.

Tagaloa 
and 
Asiasi 
are 

considering 
the 
Wolverines 

among a group of finalists, 
though most of the pair’s other 
finalists are closer to their home 

of Northern California.

The two have said they would 

like to attend the same school, 
but it is unknown whether they 
will follow through with their 
plans to be a package deal.

Michigan has not signed a 

recruit from De La Salle, widely 

regarded as a 
powerhouse, 
since 
quarterback 
Matt Gutierrez 
in 2002.

In addition 

to the De La 
Salle duo, the 
Wolverines 
will 
look 
to 

add 
another 

California 

prospect in Victor Viramontes. 
Viramontes was once a verbal 
commitment to Michigan but 
backed off his pledge in early 
December. He has positional 
versatility and could find time 
on the field as a quarterback, 
fullback, 
H-back 
or 
even 

linebacker.

Another prospect from the 

West who Michigan would love 
to add to its class is Connor 
Murphy, a long and athletic 
defensive end from Arizona.

Harbaugh 
also 
shares 
a 

personal 
relationship 
with 

Murphy’s 
family, 
having 

recruited Murphy’s older brother 
Trent while at Stanford.

Despite the national scope of 

their recruiting, the Wolverines 
have not forgotten about their 
home state. Michigan is after 
three prospects from the Great 
Lakes state in Lavert Hill, Quinn 
Nordin and Alaric Jackson.

Hill, the younger brother of 

current Wolverine junior safety 
Delano Hill, will announce at 
9 a.m. on Wednesday. He is a 
highly-rated cornerback from 
Detroit King High School, the 
2015 Michigan Division 2 state 
champions, and has taken official 
visits to Michigan, Michigan 
State, Penn State and Tennessee.

Hill, who was named the 

Lockheed Martin Air Defender 
of the Year by the U.S. Army 
All-American 
Bowl 
Selection 

Committee, has great agility 
and speed, and he could even 
contribute in the return game at 
the collegiate level.

Coincidentally, Nordin shares 

a recruiting tie with Hill — both 
were once verbal commitments 
to Penn State.

Nordin, 
ranked 
as 
the 

best kicker in the nation by 
247Sports, is also well-known 
for 
more 
than 
his 
kicking 

prowess — he received media 
attention this summer when he 
participated in a commitment 
video to announce his initial 
choice of Penn State.

He will presumably choose 

between the three schools he 
took official visits to: Michigan, 
Baylor and Southern California.

Jackson, a 6-foot-7 offensive 

tackle from Detroit Renaissance 
High School, was slated to 
choose his college destination 
Monday, 
but 
reportedly 

received a scholarship offer 
from the Wolverines the same

“(Jackson) is an athletic big

really well, and he’s a tenacious 
player.”

Jackson, who has been a 

basketball player for most of his

switched his commitment to

Copy That: The Oxford Comma

I

’ve always been a bit of a know-it-all. I can’t resist the compulsion to correct, which 
is annoying to both me and the people around me. However, this habit combined 
with my love of the written word is valued at the copy desk. Since joining the desk 

and spending time with many like-minded individuals with whom I can discuss criti-
cal issues like the tenses of lay and lie (if you don’t know, look it up; it’s way more con-
fusing than calculus and I’m an English major), I’ve developed some strong opinions 
on topics about which most people couldn’t care less. Many grammar rules are black 
and white (like your versus you’re — truly, there’s no way to get around the fact that 
they are two different words with two different meanings), but other rules are more 
flexible, and therefore up for debate among nerds like me.

One of the most hotly debated grammar rules both at the copy desk of The Michi-

gan Daily and in the grammar-geek world at large is that of the Oxford comma. The 
Oxford comma (also known as the serial comma) is the optional comma that is placed 
before the word “and” at the end of a list. It may seem silly to feel so passionately about 
something as tiny as a comma, but I care. OK, yes, it’s my job to care, but conversely 
I do this job because I care. I’d argue that punctuation and grammar rules like the 
Oxford comma are important and deserving of thought because they create very real 
changes in meaning that people generally should care about if they want to communi-
cate clearly. For example, a much-used illustration of the importance of this seeming-
ly insignificant piece of punctuation is a sentence published in The Times that read, 
“Highlights of his global tour include encounters with Nelson Mandela, an 800-year-
old demigod and a dildo collector.” Now we’re all unsure if Nelson Mandela lived to be 
an 800-year-old demigod or collected dildos. Sorry, Nelson Mandela — if only every-
one was as concerned about punctuation as the copy desk.

The Michigan Daily follows AP style guidelines, which (unfortunately for some 

opinionated writers and editors) does not allow for the Oxford comma. In order to 
avoid confusion, the copy desk steps in to save someone closer to home from the same 
fate as The Times and Nelson Mandela.

Even outside of publishing, this rule could affect your communications. Let’s say 

you send a text message to your friend that says, “Can you please invite the broomball 
players, Steve and George to our party?” Now, if your friend reads that based on the 
punctuation, you’re stuck with only two people invited to your party. But you wanted 
all of the broomball players! And you bought party favors accordingly! What a trag-
edy!

To this day the debate rages on about the Oxford comma, but the fact of the matter 

is that both ways of using it are common, and neither is without its flaws. However, if 
you care like I do, you’d probably pick a side. Even though you won’t catch an Oxford 
comma in the Daily because I grudgingly remove them almost every day, I am defi-
nitely Team Oxford Comma.

B Y E M I LY C A M P B E L L

“I find it odd that people don’t seem to value kindness 

as much anymore. It seems like, as college students, 

so much stress is placed on being successful and 

driven and intelligent that we can forget to be kind. 
It’s such a simple thing to smile at someone or tell a 
friend you appreciate them, but I feel like it can get 

lost in the craziness of college life.”

My Cultural Currency: Spice of Life

F

un fact: I lived in Texas for about four years. My first week at 
Voigt Elementary School, I was dared by a gang of elementary 
school girls to eat an entire bag of Hot Cheetos in one sitting.

“In front of us,” their ringleader said with a self-satisfied smirk, as if 

she’d really gotten me now. She was a blonde girl whose hair, I remember, 
always looked like her mother couldn’t be bothered to comb through it.

I gulped and looked at the bag in my hands again. My eyes bore into 

the “hot” section of the snack bag’s label. I glanced back and forth 
between the ringleader and my Cheetos; I had the lowest tolerance for 
spicy food in my family and I knew I would lose.

But I also wanted to make friends, and taking up this challenge 

seemed like the perfect way to do it. After years of being awkward and 
shy, this school felt like the blank slate I was looking for.

All of this reflection is in hindsight, though. None of these thoughts 

were going through my 6-year-old head — all I cared about was whether 
my daredevil personality impressed the Cool Kids™.

“So, are you?” the ringleader asked again. I hastily opened the bag and 

stuffed a handful of Cheetos in my mouth. I expected my eyes to water, 
nose to start running and ears to turn red. The last thing I expected was 
to feel utterly underwhelmed.

I think I finished the bag in less than 30 seconds.
That was the day I realized that American food was seriously bland 

and, if I’m being honest here, that I went to school with a bunch of 
wimps. Listen to me: Hot Cheetos aren’t spicy.

It’s important to me that whoever’s reading this column knows that.
I grew up with 

home-cooked 
meals 
everyday. 

I’m talking fresh-
ly made rice, rotis 
and shaag every 
single day of the 
week, three times 
a day, made by 
my 
superhuman 

mother. She was 
also notorious for 
putting an extra 
(unnecessary) 
chili in any item.

She would chop 

up 
small, 
but 

deadly, green chil-
ies into plain (plain!) rice and beans, and serve it to us with a flourish, 
ignoring my brother’s and my watering eyes.

Her efforts, though, have built up a certain amount of spice immunity 

within every member of my family. I recently ordered a No Thai dish at 
the second-to-last spiciest option, “yoga flame,” trying to ease my way 
through the levels, and felt absolutely nothing.

And although it feels a bit mean-spirited sometimes — like my slam 

on the ringleader’s unkempt hair earlier in the column — my family and 
I can’t help but find someone’s inability to handle spice comical.

My family and I frequent a small, Indian street food restaurant in 

Canton called “Neehee’s.” Its overly cramped space — with garish 
orange walls and ridiculously long queues — serves the most delicious, 
authentic Indian food I’ve ever tasted here.

Meaning it’s spicy.
One day, a customer in front of me, someone not of Indian origin and 

someone who definitely did not grow up accustomed to my mother’s pal-
ette, ordered each of their dishes by ending with the phrase “no spice 
please.”

My father turned to me, shocked, and said in Hindi, “My god, what is 

he going to eat?”

That was the day I realized 

that American food was 
seriously bland and, if I’m 
being honest here, I went 
to school with a bunch of 

wimps.

Editor’s note: the name of a student has been changed, which is 

denoted with an asterisk.
I

’ll admit it. Somewhere in the annals of my iPhone, buried 
behind pages of restaurant takeout and music subscrip-
tion apps, I have a Tinder account.

I am the worst kind of Tinder Person. I’m an infiltrator, a 

Tinder imposter. I only open the app when I am in line at Mei-
jer or waiting for my pasta water to boil, and I seldom use it to 
actually text or talk to a match. I just appreciate the self-esteem 
boost of having someone swipe right and like my profile pic-
ture, an Internet ghost with the privilege of knowing when 
someone thinks she is cute, but also with zero obligations to 
follow up. It’s all in good fun.

But I’d never go on an actual Tinder date. There’s something 

so shameful about searching the bar for someone you only know 
as “Brian,” who has brown hair and made a “Pulp Fiction” ref-
erence on his profile. With only photos and a short bio section 
to base attraction off of, there are bound to be some mistakes. 
I’ve heard some horror stories from my female friends — guys 
often lie about their age, post misleading photos, have person-
alities that differ wildly from their polished online profiles. 
And despite what romantic types might tell you, Tinder is an 
app designed solely for quick meet-ups and no-strings-attached 
sex. It’s hard to get to know anybody from a photo and quippy 
comment.

Every time I match with another user, I hear my grand-

father’s recommendation to be a “lady of breeding and sub-
stance,” a young woman who only wears pink nail polish and 

says no to marijuana. With hundreds of years of courtship tra-
dition and gender roles weighing on me, it feels improper to be 
this forward about wanting sex so badly that you’ll bed a com-
plete stranger.

Apparently, not many college-aged students share my qualms 

about dating apps. As of late 2014, an estimated 50 million users 
— half of whom are between the ages of 18 and 24 — have down-
loaded Tinder. Each of those 50 million uploads a profile pic-
ture, short bio and only the most basic of personal information: 
first name, age, location. Any other user in the area can see your 
profile and judge your hookup potential based on this informa-
tion (but mostly the profile picture). Once a couple “matches,” 
or mutually likes one another’s profiles, they are able to mes-
sage one another. You know what comes next.

But in an age where mobile dating apps like Tinder, OkCu-

pid and Grindr turn finding a partner into a series of effortless 
ones, zeroes and dick pics relayed across a 4G network, a girl 
has to wonder if there is such a thing as real dating anymore. I 
don’t mean dating as a swipe on a screen and texted plans for 
a night chilling with Netflix — I mean dating, at a restaurant 
or at the movies, with a friend of a friend and the promise of 
a nice afternoon. The kind of dating that little girls fantasize 
about before they learn what feminism is; the kind of dating 
that brought most Gen X-ers together, the traditional couple-
hood that produced countless millennials.

The kind of dating that brings two college kids together by 

fate. My father got married at 21: He was a year younger than I 
am now when he made a life-long commitment to a woman he 
loved. I am 22 years old and can count the number of dates I’ve 

had on one hand.

Am I falling behind because I’m behind with the times, 

unwilling to accept new, technology-based paradigms of dat-
ing? Is it even possible to go on a real date in 2015, or am I chas-
ing the fairytale fantasy of a prince-type who just doesn’t exist 
anymore?

Well, I guess there is only one way to find an answer. I’ve got 

to ask somebody out.

According to a study conducted at Stanford University, 30 

percent of straight American couples meet “the old-fashioned 
way,” through friends. More specifically, 10 percent of straight 
American spouses meet at work or through co-workers. To get 
that full old-fashioned experience, I’ve got to ask a co-worker 
to set me up.

I send a text message to Rob*, my friend, a writer at the 

student newspaper. I’m his boss, and he’s very charming and 
easy to talk to, so I assume he will oblige me and send me some 
names of his cute and funny friends. He’d better, or I will fire 
him.

“Hey, I have a bizarre question for you!” I message him.
“Finally!” he replies.
I explain my situation: I am writing a piece about dating ritu-

als in the digital age and investigating the viability of old-fash-
ioned dating in a youth culture that is obsessed with efficiency 
and cool apps. “Do you have a friend who might be down for 
that? A friend who wouldn’t completely bore me or make bad 
dad puns?”

By Chloe Gilke, 

Daily Arts Writer

I wasn’t kidding when I told Rob that I had a bizarre ques-

tion. We’re close, but not that close, definitely not at the level 
where it’s appropriate to text him at 2 p.m. on a Monday and ask 
him to set me up with his best-looking friends. As I wait for his 
response and agonize over the gray dots that signify he’s typing 
a message, I briefly consider asking Rob out. After all, he’s the 
one I know, the one I work with. Sitting down for coffee with 
him will be easy, even effortless. But I can’t just ask him. I wait.

“Let me think about it and see if any of my friends bring up 

really wanting to go on an old-timey date with a journalist,” he 
replies.

Something tells me that won’t be an easy sell.

It’s Tuesday, and Rob still hasn’t gotten back to me a list of 

young men who want to go on a date with me. I’m a little wor-
ried; I have a draft of my article due the following Monday and 
I want to get this first date out of the way promptly in case he 
wants a second one.

However, I feel a bit stuck. If I’m obeying the “traditional 

rules of dating,” like I am attempting to do with this experi-
ment, I can’t be the one who blatantly asks someone out. 
According to a friend, men apparently like being the ones to do 
the asking-out. It’s a huge turn-off if a girl is too forward and 
doesn’t let the guy do the pursuing: “If he likes you, he’ll man 
up and ask you out.” This is certainly not true of every man, but 
I’m worried it’s true of Rob.

I’ve decided to ask Rob to participate in my experiment 

because he’s one of the most game-for-anything individuals 
I know: He isn’t afraid to make a fool of himself performing 
improv and stand-up comedy. Most importantly, he makes me 
laugh. Our senses of humor are similar, a weird amalgamation 
of absurd and brainy, but he is funnier than I am.

Rather than approach him in person and face immediate ver-

bal rejection, I decide to embark on another one of my smooth 
texting conversations. Texting is easy, because the lack of per-
sonal affect and body language makes it easier to manipulate 
how the other person sees you. If you’re just going off a brief 
Tinder bio and picture, I can be anything and anyone. I can be 
the brazen, confident girl who asks her co-worker on a date.

“I have another bizarre question for you!” I shout into the 4G 

unknown. I think he’ll appreciate the callback to my previous 
ham-fisted introduction. He’ll find it endearing. “Are you free 
for drinks this Thursday or Saturday?”

The choice of drinks is intentional. I did my homework 

beforehand — Examiner said that a drinks date is “low pres-
sure” and that “two people seated at a bar can be less intimi-
dating than sitting at a table for two at dinner.” It doesn’t have 
to be longer than a half hour, and the bourbon might make my 
conversation skills a little neater.

“Oh man, I’ve got late night rehearsal on Thursday and then 

a performance on Saturday,” he replies.

Shit. Shit.
He’s not interested. I messed this up. Now I understand why 

guys can get so nervous asking a girl out. When you’re the per-
son stepping up, you feel at first like you’re the empowered one 
and the whole situation rests in your hands. But you’re just pre-
senting an idea, and with a simple “no,” they can crush your 
dreams of picnic lunches and mornings after.

I know enough to realize that “I’m busy” is basically a nice 

kid’s version of a rejection.

But I won’t give up so easily. With a little coaxing and some 

strict assurances that I will be “chill about this,” Rob and I 
eventually come to a conclusion. We’ll meet at Espresso Royale, 
the most casual coffee shop in town, at 2:30 p.m. on Wednes-
day. I have class then, but I begrudgingly agree to skip it. We all 
make sacrifices for love.

Rob asks for clarification on whether “this is for the class 

thing,” and I reassure him that yes, it’s only for the class thing. I 
click my phone to lock, willing myself to think about something 
else, anything other than the fact that I am getting coffee with 
a cute boy on Wednesday. I’ve got to keep my promise to Rob. 

I’ll be chill about this.

“Oooooh, I do, I do, I do, I dooooo. Hey! Oooooh, I do, I do, I 

do, I dooooo.”

I arrive for my 2:30 coffee date with Rob at 2:28, ponytail 

askew and the “Hamilton” musical soundtrack still blaring 
from the earbuds around my neck. I’m listening to the song 
where Eliza sings about falling in love with and marrying a 
brilliant and handsome man. Cringing at my overeager-ness, I 
pause the song and look for a table. After a bit of searching, I 
find a two-top nudged comfortably against a brick wall. If we 
run into anyone from work, I have the luxury of squashing my 
face against the mortar so they can’t see I’m on a date with my 
co-worker.

I’m on a date with my co-worker!
I let another Hamilton song assuage my anxieties. It’s 2:34. 

Where the fuck is Rob? I peek from behind the wall, looking 
for a lanky 6’3” guy in a sweater. I’m certain he’ll be wearing a 
sweater.

At this two-top in Espresso Royale, awaiting a date with a 

co-worker and friend whom I have occasionally considered as a 
romantic interest, I’m struck by a wave of nausea. Nerves again. 
The date feels surprisingly high-pressure despite my level of 
comfort with Rob; I imagine the cozy coffee shop lights mor-
phing into sweaty interrogation room spotlights and the room 
full of people disappearing into cinder block walls as soon as he 
walks in. If he ever walks in.

I look at the clock again. 2:36. I pull my phone from my purse, 

fingers fumbling to type a text message to my date.

The door jangles — Rob arrives, wearing a cardigan despite 

the 75-degree November heat. I step up from the wall I’m hid-
ing behind and greet him with an awkward hug.

“ ‘Sup, dude?” he drawls.
“Nah-thuh mah, brah.” He establishes the parameters 

immediately — we are on this date as friends and nothing more, 
an attractive guy doing a favor for his female friend who has a 
good personality. I adjust, letting my electric nerves simmer to 
a low blue flame. Keep calm. Dude.

I order a black coffee and he a caramel latte, and he kindly 

offers to pay “for tradition’s sake.” I thank him, and we return 
to our seats against the wall.

According to a friend, who has been on many more first dates 

than I have, good topics for conversation include shared pop 
culture interests and fun childhood anecdotes. Keep things 
light and simple. Avoid trying too hard, relax — just be cool and 
fun and sexy. I do my best to follow this advice as I begin the 
date proper.

Rob and I bitch about our co-workers for 20 minutes.
I’m surprised by how comfortable I feel in conversation with 

him; I am free to admit which writers sometimes get on my 
nerves and complain about editorial arguments that I should 
have won. He listens to my schoolgirl prattling with eye contact 
and an easy smile; I take notice that his eyes are blue and kind 
of nice.

Rob checks his watch. “We should probably start talking 

about something else; I mean, you can’t just write that we were 
gossiping the entire time.”

“Well, just change the subject! We have that capability, you 

know,” I raise my eyebrows and return a slow smile. I think I’ve 
caught myself flirting a little.

The conversation starts to peter out a little as I become self-

conscious.

“I can tell from your voice that you’re still insecure about 

being smart and funny. You know, that’s nothing to be ashamed 
of,” he reminds me, after I share a particularly heavy childhood 
anecdote. I feel like I’m on the precipice of making an enor-
mous fool of myself. Maybe I already fell off.

“I feel like I’m on a date with my therapist.”
“That’s what you get with me.”
He breaks eye contact and looks behind me for a beat. “You 

know, it’s 3:30, I should probably get going.”

I quell my disappointment and respond coolly. “Yeah, for 

sure, yeah, I should probably do some work too.”

I walk Rob to his next class, an advanced fiction-writing 

intensive. We exchange small talk for a few minutes, walking 
side by side as the browning leaves swirl in little tornadoes 
around our feet. When we reach the marble steps of the marble 
building his next class is in, I can’t help myself. I lean in.

We hug, and I thank him again for saying yes to my date pro-

posal and for helping me out with the article I’m writing. He 
says that it’s no problem.

As I walk home alone, I curse myself for all the things that 

went wrong. I got to the coffee shop too early. I let him pay, 
which everyone says means it’s a date. I called him “bruh,” 
which everyone says means it’s not a date. I over-shared, I talk-
ed too much about my own past, and made him fight for every 
word he could squeeze into our conversation. I argued with 
him. I laughed too hard when he made a masturbation hand 
gesture. I finished my coffee too early and slurped at the empty 
cup. I let him break the date off first. I hugged him — twice. I 
brought up that stupid fucking article I was writing again, posi-
tioning the date as a favor he was doing me and not a real date.

I might have had a nice time even if I weren’t on assignment.

I don’t wait around for Rob to call me about a second date. 

According to a mutual friend, he’s interested in someone else, a 
girl I know and admire. They’d make an undeniably cute couple.

I feel a tiny pang of disappointment upon hearing this news, 

but I take a minute to rationalize. Our date was as casual as it 
gets, probably the closest thing to those offhand dinner dates 
that characterized my parents’ college experience. We talked; 
we had a nice time. There was no pressure, no expectation, no 
steps to be taken. By any definition, it was a real, traditional 
date, if such a thing ever existed.

On Saturday, I go to a hip whisky bar with a few work friends. 

I follow the obligatory leather jacket dress code, order the 
obligatory Buffalo Trace, stand too close to the speakers and 
sway to a band that sounds like tipsy uncles doing karaoke at a 
bat mitzvah. I revel in my coolness — my young age, my artsy 
pals, my status as an unattached, confident lady who can rock a 
pair of boots with buckles and drink bourbon and ask boys out. 
As a growly cover of a Taylor Swift song ends, a young man with 
a ginger beard approaches me.

“So let me guess. Master’s in philosophy? I’m great at guess-

ing these things. I pick up on the clues. Those tortoiseshell 
glasses, the boots, you’re basically screaming ‘grad school.’ I’m 
Tony, by the way.”

I smile back at Tony and indulge him in a few minutes’ con-

versation. He’s not bad looking, and if this was any other night, 
I might have followed him back to his table and let him buy me 
another drink. But tonight, I just want to dance to some terrible 
bat mitzvah music and avoid the circling piranhas swiping at 
my heels and trying to get my number.

Upon sitting back down at our booth, my friend asks me why 

I didn’t flirt back with Tony: “This sounds crazy, but he seems 
like the kind of guy you’d want to settle down with.”

Laughing a little too loud, my cheeks flushed with the 

warmth of the bourbon, I respond simply.

“Nah.”

Social Unrest

by Haley McLaughlin, Daily Staff Photographer

My point here is that 

this is a made-up world 
of contrived ideas and 

people. 

ILLUSTRATION BY EMILIE FARRUGIA

1

1:47 p.m. on a Wednesday night. You’re 
about to doze off, laid heavily upon your 
twin-sized bed that leaves little room for 

turning in your sleep. Despite the heaviness you feel 
on your eyelids, you begin to feel around in the dark 
for your phone in search of some pre-bedtime enter-
tainment. You hold your phone in your hands, hover-
ing it a safe 10 inches away from your face, and hold 
on tight (mustn’t forget the numerous incidents where 
you dropped it on your face and had to suffer through 
the swelling sensation on your nose in the darkness).

Why is it that this has become the strange bedtime 

routine of our generation?

After tiring through all of your social media, fully 

caught up on how all of those people (whom you care 
for so deeply) are doing, you decide to continue explor-
ing, ignoring the lingering sting behind your tired 
eyes.

It is at this point that you wander into the mysteri-

ous “Explore Posts” section of Instagram, the section 
where you are no longer comforted by the faces of your 
friends and family, but rather subjected to a strange 
compilation of pictures that Instagram believes you 
might be interested in seeing. Why Instagram thinks 
you might like these, you’re not so sure. Maybe these 
are similar to other pictures you’ve liked recently? 
Maybe these are some pictures that your friends have 
been liking? Who cares? You keep on scrolling.

First, you see pictures of friends, and then pictures 

of friends of friends, until finally you’re left with pic-
tures of people you’ve never met and places you’ve 
never gone. At this point, it would make sense to stop. 
Just go to bed — you don’t even know what you’re 
looking at anymore. If only you could see yourself 
— lying there alone in the middle of your small dark 
room, the glow of light from your phone revealing two 
tired eyes and a double chin. But it’s only 12:32 a.m. 
You have time.

It is at this point in the night that things get really 

dismal — because now you’ve come across Instagram’s 
food accounts. It starts with a picture of mac and 
cheese that comes up in your “Explore Posts” section. 
You think to yourself, mm… that looks good, and sud-
denly you become very aware of the sad empty feeling 

in your stomach. Then you decide to torture yourself 
further, clicking on the “food porn” account’s profile 
and looking through all of their pictures. Pizza, cook-
ies, burgers, ice cream, pasta, donuts, it doesn’t end. 
You reach down and lay your hand upon your stomach, 
wondering to yourself, when was the last time I ate? It 
feels like it’s been centuries even though you know it’s 
only been a few hours. You know you should either go 
get a snack or just go to sleep but something is keeping 
you tied to your bed, shuffling through all of these pic-
tures of melting chocolate and grilled cheeses being 
pulled apart.

Your heart is full and your stomach feels emptier 

than it ever has before, and then suddenly you are cat-

apulted out of this swirl of indulgence and joy when 
you see a picture of a skinny 16-year-old girl in a biki-
ni on the beach, who looks like she’s having the best 
damn day of her entire life. Sun-kissed and sparkling, 
her body reminds you of the lean bend of a churro cov-
ered in dazzling cinnamon sugar.

The grumble in your stomach pauses, as your eyes 

dart back and forth between one picture of her per-
fectly flat stomach and the other picture of chocolate 
being drizzled over that disgustingly enticing choco-
late chip cookie. Who is this girl? Why has she come 
here to haunt me and my hungry dreams? You begin 

to spend far too much time searching through 

her pictures. You don’t understand. Does she go 

to school? Does she have a job? Or does she simply 

spend all of her time scantily clad on a beach some-

where?

Soon your jealously for this stranger’s beauty is sud-

denly eating away at the empty feeling that, minutes 
ago, you thought was coming from your stomach. You 
wish you were smiling in the sunshine and wearing 
cool clothes instead of eating an entire bag of Cheetos 
alone in your bed. Your self-worth has all but disap-
peared into thin air and you can’t fall asleep because 
you’re too busy mentally cursing this girl’s name and 
the gods who made her so damn flawless in the first 
place.

Kind of fucked up, right? We’re all jealous of these 

strangers and their seemingly beautiful lives, and yet 
we continue to torture ourselves by looking at them 
and fantasizing about things that we can’t have. It’s 
why people like the Kardashians have 50+ million fol-
lowers on Instagram. That’s more than 50 million peo-
ple watching these strangers taking pictures of their 
bodies and saying, “Try out our new Waist Trainer! If 
you want to look like us, use this healthfully unsound 
device and keep praying that one day your drastically 
unachievable goals will come true!”

And I’m not trying to preach the often-heard tales 

of eating disorders and body dysmorphia that we are 
warned of time and again. While those are severe 
problems that stem from this crazy world we live in 
where people like Chrissy Teigen are “foodies,” I think 
sometimes that only serves to squander the argument. 
My point here is that this is a made-up world of con-
trived ideas and people. Nothing is ever as it seems, 
and yet we care about it so much.

I see people my age struggle for hours to try and cre-

ate the perfect profile picture, or sit around in a room 
bouncing around ideas for the right caption for an Ins-
tagram. We’re all trying to top one another and con-
vince everyone that we are the ones who are the most 
effortlessly beautiful and that we are the ones who had 
the most fun this weekend. Happiness is measured in 
numbers of “likes” and feelings of jealousy and nobody 
will ever win in this game of artificial reality.

One Ring to Rule Them All

by Thomas West, Daily Opinion Columnist

I 

play this video game called “The Elder Scrolls V: 
Skyrim.” I like to think I’m one of the more pow-
erful wizards in the Skyrim. I have all the master 

destruction spells: Fire Storm, Blizzard, Lightning 
Storm. Not to brag, but I’m level 81 and I can raise dead 
bodies to fight for me indefinitely. I can cast Mayhem, 
where my enemies begin fighting one another. I am the 
Arch-Mage of the wizard’s College of Winterhold. I 
wear a flaming Dragon Mask that reduces the cost of 
all destruction magic by 20 percent. I am awesome.

But something holds me back. A 

necessary item I have yet to acquire. 
My white whale. I do not have the 
Ring of Peerless Destruction. I scour 
the mountains of Skyrim for it. I 
slaughter whole villages of bandits 
in my search. But still it eludes me, 
whispering from the dark.

“But Tom,” you ask. “You already 

have all this sick gear, why do you 
need that one ring?”

Shut up. You could not possibly 

hope to understand, you filthy, casual 
muggle. But I will explain. I have the 
Dragon Mask, Nahkriin, that reduc-
es Magicka cost of destruction by 20 
percent. I have dragon bone gloves 
and boots that fortify my destruction 
even further, reducing my Magicka 
costs to 25 percent of the standard 
rate. Try to follow along.

With these items alone I am fear-

some: I can use lightning to roast a 
wooly mammoth to powder in ten 
seconds. But it is not enough: The 
cost of my power is too high. But if I 
had that ring, that simple, innocuous 
ring, the cost of destruction spells 
would be reduced to nothing. Zero 
percent. Don’t you see? How could 
you. Unlimited magic, you fool, lim-
itless power.

It has been my dream since I was 

just a young, hopeful wizard walking 
through the doors of the mage’s Col-
lege of Winterhold for the first time. 
Back when all I could muster was a 
flurry of sparks and the Arch-Mage 
sent me to weed out skeletons in the basement. God, I 
miss those days. The smell of a new Grimoire. Acciden-
tally eating Deathbell in potions class. And of course, 
that young love of mine, Illia.

Oh, Illia. Shall I compare thee to a winter’s day? Your 

ice spells are as magnificent. How I miss your snow-
white skin, your black lips, those cruel, sunken eyes. 
We were perfect for each other, a wizard and his witch. 
I loved you ever since you impaled your own mother 
on an ice spike after she was corrupted by Hagravens. 
Perhaps this is why I’m so sorry for what happened to 
you, my companion, mon amour magique.

We traveled together often. She helped me defeat the 

evil dragon Alduin. It was she who helped me kill the 
dragon priest in possession of the Dragon Mask Nah-
kriin. In many ways, she helped me become the wizard 
tyrant I always knew I could be. Sometimes you just 
needed someone to believe in you. Together we beat all 
of the main questlines. I should have set the controller 

down then.

But then my quest for the ring tore everything apart. 

I am mad for it. Since all the main questlines were 
completed I had nothing to live for — only the ring. 
After discovering the ring was not in the village of 
Rorikstead, I unleash my full repertoire of destruction 
spells on the townspeople. I roasted the butcher with 
Incinerate. I turned the priest into dust. I unleashed a 
demon lord in the daycare.

What had I become? Where was that young and 

hopeful mage who wanted to save Skyrim from the 
tyranny of the Empire? I only had Illia to ground me, 
and now a bounty on my head for the massacre at Ror-
ikstead. The very people of Skyrim whom I had saved 
from Alduin, whom I had fought wars for against the 
Empire, wanted my head on a spike. I would show 
them. Illia and I together, we would find the ring and 
burn Skyrim’s cities to the ground, salting the earth 
behind us.

With his dying breath, the barkeep of the inn at Ror-

ikstead gave me what I wanted: “I’ve caught word of 
a powerful artifact hidden in Ironbind Barrow. You 
should head over there and check it out.”

The fool! He could not have known that his ran-

domly generated quest would cause the extinction of 
his whole kind. Illia and I set off toward Ironbind, an 
ancient Nord tomb in the western reaches.

The tomb is crawling with undead. Skeletons, 

ghosts, those dead thralls known as draugr. Filth. We 

make quick work of them, cutting through, deeper and 
deeper into the tomb. I can hear the ring whispering, 
down, down, somewhere in the shadows.

A dragon priest guards the final chamber. Just past 

him will be a chest, and in that chest a ring. I can feel 
it so strongly. He erupts from his sarcophagus, Vol-
sung, master of destruction, spouting fire, resurrecting 
corpses. I very nearly lose that battle — my Magicka 
had already drained so low. But it is I who reign vic-
torious. I do not even deign to loot his corpse before I 

enter the final chamber.

It is quiet. Ice covers the walls 

and ruined stone beneath that. A 
faint chanting comes from nowhere, 
or perhaps pounding from the chest 
that sits in the center of the room, 
and as I approach it grows louder, a 
hundred voices of the damned say-
ing my name, dovahkiin, dovahkiin, 
dragonborn, dragonborn. 

I lay my hands on the chest and 

open it and the chanting comes to a 
halt and I reach in and pull out what 
lies within, and it is the Iron Boots 
of Weak Improved Health.

I am fuming. Quite literally, my 

body begins to smoke. I am going to 
slaughter Rorikstead all over again. 
I will reanimate every corpse so that 
I may turn them all into dust.

But then I see it. Another chest, 

just off to the side of the chamber, 
made of simple wood and bound 
with iron.

I open it slowly, not wanting to be 

disappointed. Inside are nine gold, 
the Leather Gloves of Improved 
Alchemy, and the Ring of Peerless 
Destruction.

I slip it on and can feel the power 

course up through my hands, 
through the cord and the control-
ler, and into my own fingertips. The 
ring. The ring. The ring.

My most powerful spell is Fire 

Storm. When I cast it, a hundred 
points of fire damage erupts from 
the sky and destroys everything in 

a 20-foot radius. Usually it would drain my Magicka 
completely. But not now. The ring completes me.

I cast one Fire Storm, drawing death from the sky, 

and watch as the ice on the walls shatters and bursts 
into steam. It costs me nothing.

I cast another. And another. Hundreds upon hun-

dreds of points of damage. I am laughing maniacally in 
the game. I am laughing maniacally in real life. Skyrim 
is doomed. We did it, Illia and I. When I am done we 
will be the only ones left.

I turn around to tell her, my queen.
But Illia is not there.
Illia is dead.
My Fire Storm has killed her. She is nothing more 

than a charred corpse, the first victim of my wrath.

Oh Illia! What have I become? The most powerful 

wizard in Skyrim is nothing without you, my sweet 
digital companion.

But it was not too late to save her.

Female cheerleaders used pink pom-poms and wore pink sequined bows.

Last Sunday, the Michigan women’s basketball game against Minnesota was also its 
annual Pink Game. The game honored breast cancer survivors in many ways, from holding 
a dinner before the game, honoring the women at half time, and including as much pink in 
the Crisler Center as possible.

Survivors were given reserved seats for themselves and their families to cheer on the Wolverines.
