CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

If passed, children 

of unmarried 
couples would 
receive benefits

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–Ann 

Arbor) proposed a bill on Thurs-
day to legalize unwed, two-par-
ent adoption in Michigan. The 
issue originally catalyzed what 
is soon to be a U.S. Supreme 
Court case, DeBoer v. Snyder, 
challenging the constitutional-
ity of Michigan’s same-sex mar-
riage ban.

Before taking their case to 

state and federal court, Hazel 
Park residents April DeBoer and 
Jayne Rowse were barred from 
completing 
a 
second-parent 

adoption for their child. Though 
the two initially sought to chal-
lenge this law, the case shifted to 
a broader consideration of same-
sex marriage.

A couple would opt for two-

parent adoption if one member 
is either the biological parent of 
a child or the sole legal guard-
ian in an adoption. The other 
member of the couple would not 
be either, but wishes to legally 
adopt the child so as to officially 
be recognized as its parent.

Irwin’s legislation, House Bill 

4133, would guarantee the same 
benefits to children of single 
parents or unmarried couples 
as those given to children of 
married couples. These benefits 
include health insurance, autho-
rization for medical care and 
continued care by one parent in 
case of the death or separation of 
the other.

“Studies 
have 
shown 
the 

importance to children of main-
taining a safe, loving home with 
two stable parents,” Irwin said 
in a statement. “This bill will 
ensure that more children in 
Michigan can enjoy benefits of 
two parents who share all of the 
rights and responsibilities of 
parenthood.”

New assessment 
procedures led to 
snow day decision

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

In October, the University 

reviewed and updated its guide-
lines for responding to severe 
weather. The results of the eval-

uation process took full effect 
Monday as classes were canceled 
for a snow day.

Under this new protocol, 

called the Emergency Reduction 
in Operations, the University’s 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security spearheads evaluation 
of whether canceling classes 
is necessary, and reports their 
assessment to the University 
president, who makes the final 
call.

In a release Sunday night, 

DPSS Executive Director Eddie 
Washington wrote that danger-
ous road conditions had played a 
main role in his recommendation 
to cancel classes.

“Snowfall totals of 12 to 18 

inches with high winds are mak-
ing the roads dangerous, espe-
cially for the many faculty, staff 
and students who live outside 
the city of Ann Arbor,” he said.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said Monday that 
Washington’s recommendation 
was based on consultation with 
numerous sources, including the 
National Weather Service, the 
city of Ann Arbor and Washt-
enaw County officials.

Washington 
subsequently 

relayed information to individu-
als from the Office of the Vice 
President for Communications, 
the office of the Provost, Uni-

Judge upholds 

defamation lawsuit 

against previous 

state official 

By SHOHAM GEVA 
and EMMA KINERY

Daily News Editor and 

Daily Staff Reporter

The U.S. Court of Appeals for 

the Sixth Circuit upheld a defa-
mation lawsuit Monday against 
Andrew Shirvell, former state 
assistant attorney general, over 
his harassment of a University 
student.

Shirvell was accused of anti-

gay rhetoric against University 
alum Chris Armstrong, the first 
openly gay Michigan Student 
Assembly president. The Michi-
gan Student Assembly is now 
known as Central Student Gov-
ernment.

In 2010, Shirvell was fired after 

creating a blog titled “Chris Arm-
strong Watch,” which argued 
Armstrong was promoting a 
“radical homosexual agenda.” 
Mike Cox, Michigan’s attorney 
general at the time, wrote that 
the firing was not due to his exer-
cising of his First Amendment 
rights, but for his “harassing con-
duct.”

In 
2011, 
Armstrong 
sued 

Shirvell for defamation. A year 
later, Armstrong won the case, 
which ordered that Shirvell pay 
him $4.5 million in damages.

Shirvell appealed the decision 

shortly thereafter.

Options expand to 
include programs in 
Yiddish, Intergroup 

Relations, others

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

From programs focused on 

language and culture to art and 
entrepreneurship, the College of 
Literature Science and Arts is 
offering five new minors begin-
ning this semester.

Three of these are completely 

new and offered in LSA: Yid-
dish Studies, Arab and Muslim 
American Culture, and Inter-
group Relations Education. The 
other two — Art and Design and 
Entrepreneurship — were not 
formerly available to LSA stu-
dents, but have been officially 
incorporated into the LSA cur-
riculum.

JoAnn Peraino, LSA curricu-

lum and enrollment manager, 
said the qualifications for creat-
ing a new minor are often based 
student interest, though mul-
tiple departments cannot offer 
the same minor.

Peraino added that once a 

minor has been created within 
a department, the department is 
responsible for overseeing that 
the minor is attracting student 
interest.

“If a minor doesn’t seem to be 

taking off or one that has been 
in existence for a while begins 
to lose interest, we may retire 
minors,” she said. “But they 
typically stay on the books for 

a long, long time. We haven’t 
retired any in a long time 
because all of our minors have 
at least a few students in them.”

Intergroup Relations 

Education

The minor in Intergroup 

Relations 
Education 
focuses 

on creating discussions around 
issues of social identity, inequal-
ity and discrimination.

The minor, which is a mini-

mum of 19 credits and a maxi-
mum of 22, begins with students 
enrolling in two core courses: 
Intergroup Dialogues and Foun-
dations of Intergroup Relations.

Following those classes, stu-

dents must choose one of two 
tracks — either the Facilitative 
Leadership track or the Cam-
pus Communities and Research 
track. Students also elect one 
elective LSA course that is relat-
ed to intergroup relations and 
complete the capstone course in 
intergroup relations.

Kelly Maxwell, IGR co-direc-

tor, said the Intergroup Rela-
tions Department celebrated its 
25th year in 2013.

“Last year our campus really 

began talking about issues of 
inclusion and became more 
involved with student activism,” 
Maxwell said. “It made us real-
ize that it’s time to formalize the 
minor.”

Last year, members of the 

University’s 
Black 
Student 

Union lobbied administrators 
to address a series of demands 
designed to address stagnant 
minority enrollment and cam-
pus climate, among other issues.

In November, the Univer-

Investigation 

results presented 
to City Council 
Monday night

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

During Monday’s meeting 

of the Ann Arbor City Council, 
Ann Arbor Police Chief John 
Seto responded to the Washt-
enaw 
County 
Prosecutor’s 

decision not to press criminal 
charges against Ann Arbor 
Police Officer David Ried 
following the fatal shooting 
of Ann Arbor resident Aura 
Rosser.

The meeting also addressed 

the city’s response to the pre-

vious weekend’s snowstorm, 
as well as submitting an amic-
us brief in the case challeng-
ing the state’s ban on same-sex 
marriage, which will be heard 
by the U.S. Supreme Court in 
the spring.

During the police chief’s 

remarks, 
Seto 
expressed 

his condolences to Rosser’s 
friends and family and added 
that Rosser’s death was a 
tragic outcome of a justified 
response. He noted that Ried 
is a fine and professional offi-
cer with sound judgment.

Rosser was shot and killed 

in November while two Ann 
Arbor police officers were 
responding to a report of 
domestic violence. The pros-
ecutor’s report said Rosser 
approached the officer’s with 
a knife and declined to put it 
down when asked by police.

“The community expects 

its officers to resolve a wide 
range of conflict,” Seto said. 
“When doing so, they have a 
duty to protect citizens who 
are in danger and they have 
a right to protect themselves. 
Both were required of Officers 
Ried and Raab on November 
9.”

Seto said while the Ann 

Arbor 
Police 
Department 

awaits the delivery of 86 body 
cameras, the department is 
developing training and pol-
icy for the use of cameras by 
police officers. He noted that 
he has added diversity aware-
ness and autism awareness to 
the department 2015 training 
calendar. He also said he plans 
to continue working with the 
Ann Arbor Human Rights 
Commission in the coming

WE ALL LIVE IN A HUMAN-POWERED SUBMARINE

Engineers race underwater

RITA MORRIS/Daily

LSA freshman Brittany Wright catches a frisbee at 
the North Campus Courtyards Monday afternoon.

FROST Y FRISBE E

Engineering 
junior 
Allison 

Ward is the president of the 
Human 
Powered 
Submarine 

team. The HPS designs, builds 
and tests a human-powered 
submarine and then partici-
pates in two races that alternate 
each year: the International 
Submarine Races in Bethesda, 
Maryland, and the European 
International Submarine Races 
in Gosport, England.

What is the HPS?

It is a student-run design 

project team, so we design, 
build and race a human-pow-
ered submarine. The team is 
mostly engineers but we’ve got 
all kinds of people, all ages. 

They get experience designing 
the submarine and then actu-
ally building it and then test-
ing and raising it. We are also 
self-funded so we have business 
team that does fundraising.

How does the 

submarine work?

The pilot has an air tank. 

They are laying down in the 
submarine and they have 
pedals in the back. They are 
pedaling and that propels the 
submarine.

When and why 
did you join?

I joined the team freshman 

year. I was interested in doing a 
design project team. It seemed 
like a very interesting chal-
lenge. There’s no real-life ver-
sion of it. It’s just a completely 
brand new and weird concept.

What do you look 

for in new members?

We are looking for people 

who are interested in something 
… very different. Some people 
join because they are interested 
scuba diving. Some people are 
interested in the business side 
because it’s really good to net-
work with different people.

Native American 
trails form basis for 
spoke-wheel plan

By LARA MOEHLMAN and 

PAIGE PFLEGER

Daily Staff Reporters

As The Michigan Daily contin-

ues to watch and report on Detroit 
shaping its future, we want to 
reflect back on how the city got here. 
Our hope for this week’s Detroit 
History Series is that readers learn 
something new about the city and, 
in turn, better understand what’s to 
come. 

Detroit’s past encompasses a 

winding and dynamic narrative 
colored by the influx of immi-
grants, migrants, riots, industry, 
transportation and music. But 
what acts as the background for 
these events is the actual city 
itself — its roads and buildings and 
transportation systems that began 
as Native American trails and 
expanded to become the Motor 

City’s immense road and highway 
system.

Before the arrival of Europe-

ans, Detroit was a hub for numer-
ous 
Native 
American 
tribes 

that used several main trails for 
travel and trade. These trails led 
in different directions, but they 
all joined together at one point. 
These roads made up the spokes 
of Detroit’s “wheel” street lay-
out, and are known today as Fort 
Street to the southwest, Michigan 
Avenue to the west, Woodward 
Avenue and Grand River Avenue 
to the northwest, Jefferson Ave-
nue to the northeast and Gratiot 
Avenue between Woodward and 
Jefferson. The “hub” of the wheel 
is where Campus Martius Park 
stands today.

Joel Stone, senior curator at the 

Detroit Historical Society, said the 
spoke-wheel plan could be attrib-
uted to Native Americans.

“They were here long before 

anyone else, and they had estab-
lished trails,” he said in an inter-
view with Michigan Radio.

In 1701, Detroit was founded by 

the French trader Antoine de la 
Mothe Cadillac. On what is cur-
rently the Detroit River, Cadil-
lac built Fort Pontchartrain du 
Detroit, with the French word 
Detroit meaning “strait.” Subse-
quently, Detroit became a major 
French fur trading post until 1760, 
when the city was surrendered to 
the British after the French and 
Indian War.

In June of 1805, the city of 

Detroit caught fire. At the time, 
there was no formal fire depart-
ment, so the citizens formed a 
bucket brigade to attempt to save 
their city. They formed a line from 
the river and passed buckets into 
the city to try and extinguish the 
flame. The fire inspired Detroit’s 
city motto, “Speramus meliora; 
resurget cinerbus,” Latin for “We 
hope for better things; it shall rise 
from the ashes.”

Determined to rebuild the city 

with Washington D.C. as a model, 
Augustus 
Woodward, 
newly-

appointed chief justice of the 
Michigan Territory, hired Cana-
dian surveyors to help him plot 
the city’s new parks, streets and 
lots. Inspired by an urban plan-
ning movement in France, Wood-
ward wanted Detroit’s layout to 
be attractive and spacious, with 
major streets radiating from one 
central spot.

Woodward’s plan for the city 

called for a “point of origin,” locat-
ed at the junction of Woodward 
and Monroe avenues, from which 
each mile road in Michigan’s mile 
road system marks their distance. 
For instance, Seven Mile Road 
is seven miles from the “point of 
origin.” The center of Campus 
Martius Park was chosen as the 
focal point because it remained 
the city’s central hub from Native 
American trails.

While the city’s road system 

was being built, boats were the 
main mode of transportation 
in the Great Lakes and Detroit 
region.

“Water was the primary way 

that people moved around, to get 
to Detroit,” Stone said in an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily. 
“That was really important ini-
tially to get people into the Great 
Lakes region, and then once they 

were here and living here, it was 
important to move them around 
to business meetings, to go visit 
relatives in other towns, that kind 
of thing.”

In 1836, street signs appeared 

for the first time in Detroit. Down-
town streets were cobblestone 
while others were wooden plank. 
Bicyclists were the first to push for 
paved roads.

The mid- to late 1830s saw a 

massive growth in transporta-
tion to and from Detroit. Stage-
coaches that ran between Detroit 
and Chicago were introduced, and 
a Detroit to Pontiac railway was 
completed with horse-drawn cars. 
The country’s railroad system was 
expanding at this time, too.

“Starting in the 1830s, Detroi-

ters could get fresh oysters from 
the East Coast because train 
travel cut the distance down to 
just a couple of days, whereas two 
decades earlier it had been a cou-
ple of months,” Stone said.

Over the course of the next 30 

years, trains spread across the 
Midwest. Two main lines traveled 
through Detroit: Michigan Cen-
tral on the south side of town, and 

then down the Dequindre cut ran 
another line that changed names 
several times. By 1854, the first 
Detroit to New York City rail was 
completed.

In 1863, horse-pulled streetcars 

appeared on Jefferson and Wood-
ward avenues. The fare was five 
cents. By the 1890s, three street-
car companies operated 66 miles 
of track within the city’s limits, 
and streetcars, called interurbans, 
ran between towns.

Serving as a streetcar driver 

became a popular job in the city. 
One such streetcar driver was the 
uncle of amateur Detroit transpor-
tation historian H. Bernard Craig. 
Craig, a Detroit native, worked 
for the Detroit Department of 
Transportation for more than 30 
years before he retired. He now 
spends most of his spare time in 
the library, researching Detroit’s 
nuanced transportation history.

“A lot of people credit the street-

cars for helping the development 
of the city because it provided the 
means for people to now move out 
a little farther,” Craig said.

Detroit’s 
streetcars 
stopped 

running in the late 1950s, which 

many attribute to General Motors. 
Called the Trolley Conspiracy 
or the Streetcar Transparency, 
many believe GM bought up the 
streetcar companies to remove 
the tracks and replace them with 
their newly designed GM motor-
buses. The conspiracy was true in 
other cities, Craig said, but not in 
Detroit.

The streetcar tracks in Detroit 

were so damaged that it actu-
ally cost less to purchase a fleet of 
buses than it would have to fix the 
streetcar lines. Buses also had the 
same capacity as streetcars.

“Their buses could hold 50 pas-

sengers — the same amount of 
people that the streetcars could 
hold,” Craig said.

The removal of the streetcar 

system made Detroit the largest 
metropolitan city without some 
form of a commuter rail service.

Today, construction is under-

way for the M-1 rail that will run 
down 3.3 miles down Woodward 
Avenue from Jefferson Avenue to 
West Grand Boulevard. The rail 
will serve as a curbside trans-
portation system, much like the 
streetcars of the past.

Storm dumps most

The rumble of plows and 

roar of blowers shook many 
neighborhoods in communities 
across parts of Michigan’s Lower 
Peninsula Monday as road crews 
and homeowners worked to dig 
out from 1½ feet of snow and the 
Detroit area’s biggest snowfall in 
four decades.

spanned about 24 hours after 
moving into southeast Michigan 
early Sunday morning. Coming 
with it were wind gusts that 
covered sidewalks, streets, roads 
and freeways with the quickly 
accumulating snow.

“It is Michigan. It is February,” 

Gina Nitz of Roseville told The 
Detroit News while waiting at a 
bus stop Monday morning to get 
to work. “I just hope this doesn’t 
mean winter will last until May.” 

Students 
at 
hundreds 
of 

Michigan 
schools 
got 
three-

day weekends. Morning shifts 
at some auto plants also were 
canceled, partly due to dangerous 
driving conditions. Police said 
freeway off-ramps were especially 
problematic. 

DENVER, COLORADO 
Colorado plunges 
into gun debate 

Senate Republicans advanced 

a bill to repeal expanded back-
ground checks for gun sales in 
Colorado.

The law took effect in 2013 and 

was one of the most hotly debated 
issues of the year when Democrats 
passed it.

At the time, they controlled 

both legislative chambers, but 
Republicans regained the Sen-
ate in November and have made 
undoing the law a priority.

The law expanded background 

checks to sales conducted online 
and between private sellers. 

HONG KONG 
Reports show no 
cuts in Aisian stocks

Most Asian stock benchmarks 

were relatively subdued on Tues-
day as investors waited to see 
whether Australia’s central bank 
policymakers would announce an 
interest rate cut to help shore up 
economic growth.

KEEPING 
SCORE: 
Japan’s 

benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 0.4 
percent to 17,479.92 while South 
Korea’s lost 0.3 percent to 1,947.14. 
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 
0.2 percent to 5,636.10 while Hong 
Kong’s Hang Seng lost 0.1 per-
cent to 24,458.67. The Shanghai 
Composite Index on mainland 
China rose 0.8 percent to 3,153.43, 
rebounding a day after poor fac-
tory data dragged down shares.

DECISION DOWN UNDER: 

There’s growing expectation that 
the Reserve Bank of Australia 
could announce a rate cut after its 
meeting today, following a recent 
surprise move by Canada, another 
commodity-producing 
country. 

With inflation easing as commod-
ity prices slump, policymakers 
have more space to maneuver to 
bolster economic growth by cut-
ting rates. But economists are 
doubtful that Australia needs to 
act just yet.

DONESTK, UKRAINE
Artillery fire kills 
at least 12 civilians 

Artillery fire killed at least 

12 civilians in the main rebel 
stronghold of Donetsk on Friday 
amid fierce fighting between 
pro-Russia separatists and gov-
ernment troops as hopes for a 
break in hostilities were dashed 
when an attempt to call a new 
round of peace talks failed.

Five people were killed as 

they were waiting for humani-
tarian aid outside a community 
center and two people were 
killed in the same neighborhood 
when a mortar shell landed near 
a bus stop.

By the time an Associated 

Press journalist arrived at the 
community center, the bodies 
were taken away.

NEWS BRIEFS

In the decision released 

Monday, 
the 
Sixth 
Circuit 

Court 
upheld 
the 
charges 

brought against Shirvell, but 
removed damages awarded for 
false light invasion of privacy 
— which consists of publishing 
information that casts another 
person in a false light — because 
the court found that the jury 
in the original case used the 
same statements as the basis for 
both the false light charge and 
another charge.

This reduced the total sum of 

the sanctions against Shirvell 
to $3.5 million.

In an interview Monday 

afternoon, Armstrong’s attor-
ney Deborah Gordon applaud-
ed the decision. She said based 
on Shirvell’s current financial 
state, she wasn’t sure if the full 
judgement would be recovered, 
but that the symbolic value of 
the ruling was also important.

“Andrew Shirvell is unem-

ployed, and as far as I know, 
he doesn’t have any assets,” 
she said. “So the odds of Chris 
Armstrong ever collecting the 
$3.5 million — not good, in my 
opinion. However, the judge-
ment is priceless. Because that 
was the jury speaking, and the 
jury represents our community. 
Chris did this because he had 
no alternative. Shirvell would 
not retract the disgusting lies 
he told about Chris. He took 
them to national T.V. So we 
had to turn to the jury system 
and the courts to clear Chris’s 
name, which has now hap-
pened.”

She said she wouldn’t be 

surprised if Shirvell chose 
to appeal, but added that she 
didn’t think it was realistic.

Reached by phone Monday 

afternoon, Shirvell said he had 
no comment at the moment on 
the ruling. In a 2012 interview 
following the initial district 
court ruling, however, he hint-
ed to the prospect of a Supreme 
Court appeal.

”(The case) will for sure be 

overturned on appeal either 
at the sixth circuit (court) in 
Cincinnati, or eventually at the 
U.S. Supreme Court — it may be 
a landmark First Amendment 
case,” Shirvell said at the time.

The ruling also touched on 

the appeal of a federal court’s 
decision last year to dismiss a 
counter-suit filed by Shirvell 
against Gordon. The coun-
ter-suit alleged that she had 
worked with the attorney gen-
eral’s office to fire him.

Authoring the opinion for 

the court, Federal Judge Julia 
Gibbons wrote that the appeal 
was frivolous, and also warned 
Shirvell against pursuing fur-
ther litigation in that direction.

“As time went on, it became 

increasingly 
clear 
that 

(Shirvell’s) claims amounted 
to nothing more than specula-
tion,” the opinion stated. “His 
failure to withdraw the allega-
tions violated Shirvell’s con-
tinuing duty of candor.”

In January of this year, in 

a separate case on the same 
incidents, the Michigan Court 
of Appeals also ruled against 
Shirvell, stating that he was 
not entitled to unemployment 
benefits after his termination. 
That ruling overturned a previ-
ous 2012 ruling by the Ingham 
County Circuit Court which 
said that the state could fire 
him, and he was entitled to the 
benefits.

At the time, Shirvell said in a 

statement that he would appeal 
that ruling to the Michigan 
Supreme Court.

Gordon 
said 
should 
the 

appeal occur, Monday’s deci-
sion could have an impact on 
that case as well.

“I think that it’ll be impor-

tant, as a matter of examining 
the law, that the Sixth Circuit 
court of Appeals has found 
that he violated the law,” Gor-
don said. “This whole idea of 
whether he should get unem-
ployment benefits or get his job 
back, in part it’s going to turn 
on did you do anything illegal? 
Then it’s kind of a done deal 
because you’re not entitled to 
unemployment.”

versity Plant Operations and 
the Office of Student Life via 
conference call. Ultimately, the 
group decided canceling classes 
would be the best move — a sug-
gestion that Washington ulti-
mately delivered to University 
President Mark Schlissel.

“Really 
recognizing 
that 

there is a significant number of 
University employees, faculty 
and staff who live elsewhere 
in Washtenaw County and 
beyond, and also recognizing 
that there are some students 
who are not necessarily in Ann 
Arbor … It was really that con-
sideration of what conditions 
could be,” Washington said.

The new system resulted 

from a task force to review 
University operation reduction 
procedures after some students, 
faculty and staff expressed 
concerns that the University 
did not cancel classes last year 
during a period of inclement 
weather in the first week of 
January, prompting a review of 
the University’s severe weather 
policy.

The 
University 
later 

announced a cold day in late 
January.

Following that cold day, Uni-

versity Provost Martha Pollack 
said in a Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs 
meeting that policies then in 
place were not sufficient to 
address last-minute cancella-
tion of classes.

“By the time it became 

clear that we were facing an 
extraordinary weather event, 
we realized that we didn’t have 
appropriate 
mechanisms 
to 

close the University even if we 
wanted to,” she said. “Closing a 
university is more like closing a 
city than closing a building. You 
can’t just close; there is a hospi-
tal, there is a police force, there 
are students on campus who 
need to be fed.”

Though Monday’s snow day 

was the second cancellation of 
classes in the last year, Fitzger-
ald said closure will not likely 
become a yearly trend.

“I think what we have is real-

ly a coincidence of two winters,” 
he said. “What will happen in 
the future is just impossible to 
predict.”

months.

“In the weeks following 

the incident I have witnessed 
a great deal of patience and 
restraint through many peace-
ful demonstrations that have 
occurred,” Seto said. “I am 
grateful to be the police chief 
in a community where its citi-
zens can express their opinion 
in a peaceful and respectful 
manner.”

Demonstrators 
marched 

through Ann Arbor Saturday 
protesting 
police 
brutality 

and the prosecutor’s decision, 
which characterized the shoot-
ing as an act of “lawful self-
defense.”

The Council also addressed 

the city’s response to the 
severe weather and snow that 
accumulated over the week-

end. City Administrator Steve 
Powers noted that Ann Arbor 
has received 14 inches of snow 
in the past 28 hours, reportedly 
the third largest event two-day 
accumulation since 1970. Since 
Monday afternoon all major 
roads have been plowed twice.

“Our crews are working 

all hour shifts 24 hours a day 
and it’s expected that all local 
streets will be plowed by 1 p.m. 
on Tuesday,” he said.

Powers said the city will 

clean dead end streets and will 
follow with downtown alleys 
and clear snow from sidewalks, 
parking lots and lanes and 
parks.

The Council also unani-

mously approved a resolution 
that provided for Ann Arbor’s 
listing as a supporting munici-
pality in an amicus brief for 
DeBoer vs. Rick Snyder.

The case, which the U.S. 

Supreme Court added to its 

2015 docket in January, chal-
lenges the state’s ban on same-
sex marriage.

Ann Arbor Mayor Chris-

topher Taylor (D) noted that 
the city has supported amicus 
briefs from district courts and 
appellate courts all the way to 
the Supreme Court, and said he 
is delighted City Council has 
supported the defense of right 
to marriage.

“Equal protection of the law 

is fundamental to our soci-
ety and if what happens come 
June is what we all hope hap-
pens come June, then that will 
be good day and that principle 
will be ratified and moved for-
ward,” Taylor said.

Finally, 
City 
Council 

approved the DTE Energy Co. 
installation of a solar panel at 
the Ann Arbor Municipal Air-
port. The license is effective for 
20 years with the option of 10 
one-year renewals.

sity announced two of the IGR 
courses would also fulfill the 
Race and Ethnicity degree 
requirement.

Maxwell added that IGR is a 

valuable addition to any major, 
especially given her belief that 
students must become global 
citizens who know how to dis-
cuss complex issues pertaining 
to diversity and inequality.

“Students who earn a minor 

in intergroup relations educa-
tion will develop the insight 
and skills to lead diverse orga-
nizations and work effectively 
across differences,” she said.

Yiddish Studies

The Yiddish Studies minor 

was introduced in an effort to 
provide students with exten-
sive opportunities to study the 
Yiddish language and explore 
Yiddish culture from a per-
spective of a variety of disci-
plines.

Students interested in the 

minor must take Elementary 
Yiddish. 
Yiddish 
Lecturer 

Alexandra Hoffman said the 
language prerequisite is neces-
sary to give students basic com-
petence in reading, writing and 
communicating in the Yiddish 
language.

Hoffman added that the 

minor was created to showcase 
the expertise of the Univer-
sity’s Yiddish studies faculty, 
and to raise awareness about 
the language.

“Just like any language, 

Yiddish is a whole treasure 
chest to rich literature, music, 
poetry, novels and history,” she 
said. “Michigan is really a hub 
of pretty fantastic and excep-
tional Yiddish studies profes-
sors. We have three levels of 
Yiddish language instruction 
here, which is unique.”

Arab and Muslim Ameri-

can Culture

The Arab and Muslim Amer-

ican Culture minor is designed 
to address the cultural politics 
of being Arab or Muslim in the 
U.S., as well as the contribu-
tions of these groups to Ameri-
can Culture.

To 
complete 
the 
minor, 

which requires a 15-credit 
minimum, students take an 

introductory survey course in 
either Intro to Arab American 
Studies or The Middle East in 
Hollywood Cinema. Students 
then select additional courses 
offered by the Arab and Mus-
lim American Studies program.

Evelyn Alsultany, associate 

professor of American culture, 
wrote in an e-mail interview 
that the AMAS minor is unique 
to the University, the Univer-
sity of Michigan — Dearborn 
campus and San Francisco 
State University.

“We see the AMAS minor 

as a unique and important 
opportunity for students given 
the large demographic of Arab 
Americans and Muslim Ameri-
cans in Michigan and the 
current challenges to under-
standing Arab and Muslim 
identities in today’s political 
climate,” Alsultany wrote.

She 
said 
students 
have 

already 
started 
declaring 

minors in AMAS, and some of 
whom have told her the pro-
gram offers them the skills to 
develop a more complex analy-
sis of today’s social and politi-
cal issues, such as the “war on 
terror” and its representation 
in the media.

Art and Design

The Art and Design minor, 

offered through the School of 
Art and Design, is expected to 
have significant enrollment.

JoAnn McDaniel, assistant 

dean for undergraduate pro-
grams in the Art and Design 
School, said she foresees the 
minor will be limited by the 
amount of space that the 
school’s facilities offer.

“You can’t put 25 students 

into a studio class that is 
capped at 20 and works best for 
16,” she said. “If you’re in a lec-
ture class, you could just bring 
in some more chairs.”

The minor is an 18-credit 

program. There is one prereq-
uisite course, which can be a 
choice of a drawing course or a 
dimensional course, which can 
be fulfilled by several 2D and 
3D studio classes.

McDaniel said she hopes the 

minor program will be similar 
to the art major in that students 
can individualize their sched-
ule to create a minor that works 
for them.

“For instance, a student who 

is in environmental studies and 
really interested in sustainabil-
ity, they can do a minor in art 
and design with an emphasis on 
sustainability design,” McDan-
iel said. “If you were a creative 
writing student, you may find 
taking courses in graphic nar-
rative and electronic books can 
really broaden and deepen the 
scope of that minor.”

Entrepreneurship

The minor in Entrepreneur-

ship, offered through the Inno-
vate Blue program, aims to 
foster an entrepreneurial spirit 
in the classroom through part-
nerships with businesses and 
local organizations.

The minor is a 15-credit pro-

gram available to any sopho-
more-standing student with a 
declared major who is in good 
academic standing.

In addition to the 15-credit 

requirement, the minor also 
requires 
two 
semesters 
of 

substantial 
entrepreneurship 

focus through extracurricular 
activities.

The minor comprises six 

core credits that will establish 
fundamental knowledge in cre-
ativity, innovation and busi-
ness disciplines.

Beyond those requirements, 

students will take a mini-
mum three credits of elective 
courses that allow students to 
explore disciplinary areas in 
depth.

The final portion of the 

minor is a 6-credit immersion 
program. The “practicum” sec-
tion of the minor gives students 
the opportunity to experience 
real-world learning in front of 
a large audience.

Jeni Olney, Innovate Blue’s 

academic advisor, said the cre-
ation of the minor was a grass-
roots movement by students 
who wanted an entrepreneur-
ship curriculum on their tran-
script.

“What’s really great about 

the minor is that we have the 
ability to pull from the mul-
tidisciplinary strengths from 
the University,” Olney said. 
“It’s really exciting because 
the minor isn’t getting turned 
down by any of the schools 
or colleges at the University 
because they see the value of 
the minor.”

down 
Michigan’s 
same-sex 

marriage ban, allowing more 
than 300 couples to obtain 
marriage licenses. Later, the 
Sixth Circuit Court ordered a 
stay and later upheld the ban.

The U.S. Supreme Court will 

review the case, as well as sim-
ilar cases from Kentucky, Ten-
nessee and Ohio, this spring.

Irwin said he first became 

interested in the legality of sec-
ond-parent adoption when he 
worked as a commissioner in 
Washtenaw County. He said, in 
2004, a local judge was grant-
ing adoption to same-sex par-
ents until the Michigan court 
caught wind and ruled that all 
judges were prohibited from 
such action.

Because of the “direct, local 

impact” Washtenaw County 
faced, Irwin saw the impor-
tance of granting second-par-
ent adoption and decided to 

pursue the issue throughout 
his career.

“It was a tragedy here at the 

local level and we were now 
not allowed to reflect our local 
responsibility,” he added.

He first introduced the bill 

to Michigan Congress in 2011 
upon winning a seat in the 
Michigan House that year.

Brad O’Conner, president 

of the Jim Toy Community 
Center, a resource for LGBTQ 
residents of Washtenaw Coun-
ty, lauded Irwin’s continual 
persistence in bringing up the 
issue in the face of continued 
pushback from opposing mem-
bers in the Michigan legisla-
ture.

O’Conner said by not pass-

ing this bill and similar bills, 
Republican 
representatives 

allow discrimination to persist 
within the state.

“They have no interest in 

passing this; they would rather 
go as far right as possible,” he 
said.

Irwin said the bill is mod-

eled after other states with 
similar laws, such as Oregon, 
California and Wisconsin.

Irwin added that though 

the discussion has become 
directed at LGBTQ couples, in 
reality there are many couples 
that would wish to second-
parent adopt, including other 
family members or unmarried 
straight couples.

“It’s very sad because once 

again you have parents who are 
trying to step up to adopt chil-
dren, in some cases very needy 
children, and the state is trying 
to prevent them from taking 
accountability for these kids,” 
he said.

O’Conner said even if same-

sex marriage is legalized in the 
state, there is still more work to 
be done for LGBTQ rights.

“We might have marriage 

equality but we still don’t have 
secondary adoption, we still 
don’t have protections in work-
place,” O’Conner said. “You can 
get married but you can still be 
fired for being gay.”

I 

get sick a lot. Like a lot a lot. 
“My parents never let me skip school,” 
was a jealous line I got growing up. And 

why wouldn’t they be jeal-
ous? For kids who don’t get 
sick often, staying home 
once a week would seem 
excessive, perhaps luxuri-
ous. As far as they knew, I 
was watching cartoons and 
eating cookies all day while 
they were solving math 
problems.

Of course, I wasn’t. I was 

doing all of the schoolwork 
for that day from my couch, 
and I was catching up on 
sleep that didn’t come to me at night. The 
sleep was a big part of it. I got less and less 
sleep every weeknight, and by the end of the 
week I was exhausted to my breaking point.

I’ve gotten migraines since I was in first 

grade, and they became more frequent in 
middle and high school. When I was over-
tired, the migraines came more frequently. 
I would wake up with them on Friday morn-
ings and be unable to leave my bed. And that’s 
how it became almost weekly that I would 
miss Friday mornings. But only mornings, 
because I knew had a limited number of sick 
days and that I would end up needing those 
afternoons later.

The afternoons were for illnesses — influ-

enzas and other bugs that would crop up in 
school. I got my flu shot every year, and I still 
caught the dreaded virus every time it swept 
the building. I caught the cold in the winter 
and the weird cold that comes around in the 
spring. If it was contagious, I had it, and you 
could bet I would be at school with it in the 
mornings until it wore me down.

Sick days were a strategy, and my sickness 

was managed like clockwork: I would be late 
to school on Fridays to sleep off my migraines, 
and I would leave school early whenever 
there was a disease floating around. It prob-
ably looked a little too neat. I worried people 
would think I was faking it. I wondered if I 
was faking it. I worried I was imagining my 
diseases, because it seemed impossible that 
anyone could have such a tendency for fall-
ing ill. It seemed so improbable that I tried 
to talk myself into believing I was imagin-
ing my headaches, joint pains, stomach aches 
and tiredness. I hated missing school and I 
couldn’t wait to get to college — the promised 
land of flexible schedules.

I think most students can predict my dis-

illusionment upon arriving at college. Large 
lectures can be skipped if you’re willing to 
put in the effort of teaching yourself the mate-
rial. Teaching myself occasional lessons from 
home was something I was used to doing in 
high school. But small lectures, discussions 

and labs almost always have an attendance 
grade worked into the syllabus. Don’t get me 
wrong: when class isn’t 7:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. 
every day, it gets a lot easier to attend. And I 
have developed a few tricks as my class stand-
ing got higher and I had more control over my 
schedule. I try to avoid scheduling my days in 
huge chunks of time so I can nap in between 
classes if I’m getting a migraine, and I don’t 
schedule work or classes for Friday mornings. 
But my control over the situation ends there.

I’m still living at the whims of unpredict-

ably falling ill. Because I rarely have more 
than two classes back-to-back, I’m pretty 
good at rolling out of bed and faking wellness 
for three hours before rolling back into bed. 
My philosophy is usually that if I’m not vom-
iting at that exact moment, I can be in class.

It’s not always doable. Even with my strat-

egies, I miss a lot of class. I always use up 
my allotted freebie days that the attendance 
grade sometimes allows. Then it gets trickier, 
because I have to start explaining myself. I’ve 
sent more “sorry, but I’m sick today” e-mails 
than I can count. Once I’ve sent the same pro-
fessor multiple, I start to feel weird about it.

I start feeling like I need to specify the 

problems I have in order to be believed, but 
I don’t want to tell everyone the details of my 
personal life just because they are assigning a 
grade. I’ve done it before (trust me, there are 
instructors on this campus who know more 
about my bodily systems than some of my 
doctors). But I don’t like it.

I’m so used to combating disease that I 

don’t even bother doctors with symptoms I 
know how to handle. I rarely have a doctor’s 
note excusing me, which has never bothered 
me because I feel far too old to be bringing 
notes to the teacher (and most classes actu-
ally allot you a limited number of excused 
absences). A good doctor’s note would pass 
on information I don’t necessarily need my 
professors to know.

For example, I got diagnosed with an 

auto-immune disorder last summer. I worry 
instructors might look at it differently than I 
do. For me it came as a relief more than any-
thing else. It spoke to my susceptibility to ill-
ness, my pains, my difficulties sleeping. The 
diagnosis was validation: yes, you were sick, 
really. It was the reassurance I needed, but 
not information I need my graders to know.

When I remember growing up, I don’t 

remember a childhood of illness. One of my 
childhood friends likes to tell me I was “sick-
ly.” The word frustrates me, because it leaves 
me with the image of a paling child, frail 
and bedridden. That wasn’t and isn’t me. I’m 
tenaciously fighting to spend as much time at 
school as I can. I like to think I’m resilient.

I am resilient

I

’ll never forget my first love. 
Our eyes first met when I 
was 17 and extremely impres-

sionable. 
She 

was 
seven, 
but 

the 
age 
differ-

ence didn’t seem 
to 
matter. 
Her 

skin was velvet, 
her body was the 
color of the Gulf 
of Mexico and she 
had a moon roof 
that seemed to 
extend for days. 
She didn’t have 
a name, and she 
didn’t have much to say. My friends 
and family liked to call her 2003 
Ford Taurus. She gave me every-
thing I had ever wanted: freedom.

Using my new job at Jimmy 

John’s as leverage, I had finally 
convinced my parents that I was 
mature enough to handle the 
responsibility of my own car. Look-
ing back, I’m pretty sure they were 
just tired of chauffeuring around 
my pre-teen brothers.

I believe in life after love, but 

that didn’t make losing my Taurus 
any easier. The last day we spent 
together feels like yesterday. It was 
a freezing February afternoon, and 
we were heading home after a long 
day at Andover High School. A mile 
from home and bumping Jason 
Derulo’s “In My Head,” we turned 
right onto the winding west side of 
Hickory Grove Road. About 30 feet 
ahead, a Toyota Sequoia, bearing a 
striking resemblance to the grim 
reaper, was backing toward us on 
the wrong side of the road. Taurus 
was a fighter, but she was no match 
for black ice. I pumped her breaks 
with desperation as she honked 
for life. It was too late. At a speed 
of just 25 miles per hour, we slid 30 
feet and collided into the Toyota, 
which made out with just a scratch. 
My car now resembled a pile of 
scrap metal.

After dialing 911, the officer 

neglected to write the driver of the 
Toyota a reckless driving ticket, 
because legally both of us were at 
fault. Although I was obeying the 

speed limit at 25 miles per hour, I 
was not driving “safely for the con-
ditions.” The conditions of course, 
being an unsalted, pothole-ridden 
residential ice rink disguised as 
a road. I’m not the first, or last, 
Michigander to fall victim to Mich-
igan’s dangerous roads. According 
to Michigan State Police, in 2013, 
289,061 crashes were reported to 
the police in Michigan: 0.3 per-
cent of these accidents resulted 
in fatalities, 18 percent resulted in 
injury and 82 percent resulted in 
 

property damage.

Injury aside, as a teen I was 

extremely fortunate to have parents 
who financed both my car and the 
insanely expensive auto-insurance 
that comes along with every teenage 
driver in Michigan. In Michigan, 
drivers are legally required to pur-
chase a minimum basic no-fault auto 
insurance. As of 2012, the average 
driver in Michigan paid $1,048.87 
per year for auto insurance. Insur-
ance rates are even more for teenage 
drivers, who are statistically most 
likely to be involved in an accident. 
In Detroit, the average law abid-
ing driver pays $5,941 per year for 
no-fault auto insurance, the high-
est rate of any city in the United 
States Detroit Police estimate that 
60 percent of drivers in Detroit are 
uninsured, and risk paying a $200 to 
$500 fine and a year in jail if caught 
driving without insurance.

The average Detroiter makes 

$26,325 per year, and commutes 26 
minutes to work.

Working Detroiters are expected 

to spend 23 percent of their income 
on no-fault auto insurance. No won-
der the city has seen a declining pop-
ulation the entirety of my existence.

Sure it’s expensive, but if you pay 

for no-fault auto insurance, after 
an accident the insurance compa-
ny pays to fix the car, right? Keep 
dreaming. Basic no-fault auto insur-
ance in Michigan does not cover 
collision, and if you want it, expect 
to pay an additional premium. Colli-
sion insurance probably isn’t a wise 
investment when your car is worth 
about $3,500. No-fault auto insur-
ance covers you in event of an auto 

injury, as well as property protec-
tion, which covers up to $1,000,000 
in property damage. Keep in mind a 
car isn’t considered “property.”

Approximately 52,000 people 

were injured in auto accidents in 
Michigan in 2013, and 881 were 
killed. At a rate of 4.74 million 
registered vehicles in Michigan 
in 2012, Michiganders spent just 
under $5 billion on auto insurance.

I have a hard time believing that 

auto insurance companies right-
fully awarded anywhere near that 
amount to accident victims. No 
wonder Flo from Progressive is 
always so irritatingly peppy.

Michiganders 
aren’t 
terrible 

drivers. North Carolina has a simi-
lar population to Michigan, and 
in 2013, their accident rate per 
licensed driver was 0.8 percent less 
than Michigan’s.

The average annual snowfall in 

Charlotte, North Carolina, is four 
inches. Detroit’s average annual 
snowfall is 11.05 times higher than 
North Carolina’s: 51 inches. We 
need to be spending more on pre-
ventative measures, like infrastruc-
ture, salt trucks and snowplows, 
and less gambling on potential 
health care expenses.

Lawmakers recently proposed 

a one-percent increase in Michi-
gan’s sales tax, and voters will 
decide on this measure in May. If 
the tax passes, it will generate just 
over $1 billion in tax revenue to 
invest in our roads. No-fault auto 
insurance, forced on every driv-
ing Michigander, costs citizens 
more than $5 billion per year. If 
we used just one-fifth of this on 
our roads, we could probably pre-
vent thousands of accidents from 
occurring in the first place. No-
fault auto insurance paired with an 
increase in sales tax will financially 
cripple those already struggling in 
Michigan, especially in Detroit. If 
Michigan is going to increase sales 
tax to seven percent, we need to 
eliminate Michigan’s no-fault auto 
 

insurance requirement.

T

he song “Breakout” by OPM on “The 
New Guy” soundtrack said it best: 
“Don’t need no edu-

cation, already know Cali-
fornia’s a nation.” California 
is a massive state. With 38.8 
million residents, it is the 
most populous state and 
third-largest geographically 
in the United States. It really 
is a mini-nation within the 
country. There was even a 
proposal to split California 
into six smaller states this 
past year. It, of course, did 
not even get on the ballot.

The point of this is to explain that Califor-

nia is a unique and diverse state. Drive east 
through the extremely liberal Bay Area, and 
you will soon end up in small rural towns 
that are not much different than those in the 
Midwest. Drive south and you will hit L.A. 
and San Diego, made up of large populations 
of Latin American Catholics and Hollywood 
divas. The Bay Area has its own social norms, 
demographics and political ideals that are 
very different from the rest of California.

In the same way, so does Ann Arbor. When 

I first started researching the University, 
I came across a line that said: “Ann Arbor: 
The Berkeley of the Midwest.” Ann Arbor 
is a liberal hub in the middle of a conserva-
tive state. The actual University part of Ann 
Arbor is populated with people from these 
conservative areas. While they are young and 
educated, which makes them more likely to 
be Democratic, they still have the traditional 
values of a conservative home, most impor-
tantly when it comes to marriage.

During my time at Michigan, I have noticed 

a certain fixation on marriage that was com-
pletely foreign to me. While the average age 

of marriage for women in California is only 
0.4 years higher than in Michigan, (26.8 ver-
sus 26.4 years of age, respectively), I feel like 
the discrepancy is much greater when I com-
pare my experiences in the Bay Area to that 
26.4 in Michigan.

The Bay Area is a very career- and indi-

viduality-oriented place, and the idea of 
following a guy instead of your career is on 
par with being a Republican in terms of the 
stigma attached to it. Marrying your college 
or high-school sweetheart never seemed like 
a feasible or desirable goal to me. My parents 
are old, 60 and 65, and met each other well 
into their 30s. My mom got married in black. 
Many of my friends’ parents are divorced 
and not looking for a second marriage. While 
growing up in Palo Alto, these things just 
seemed like the norm, but after moving to 
Michigan, I was exposed to a very different 
lifestyle and way of thinking.

The parents of my college friends are 

much younger than my parents, almost 10 
to 15 years. None are divorced, most mar-
ried their college partners and many started 
having kids at an early age. The people I have 
met in Michigan focus on the endurance of 
their relationships. They wonder, “Could I 
see myself marrying this person in 10 years?” 
Marriage comes up 100 times more in my con-
versations here than at home. By my junior 
year, it seemed like every one of my friends 
was in a long-term relationship and discuss-
ing the future with their significant other.

The closest I’ve come to talking about mar-

riage was this past winter break in Palo Alto, 
when I discussed an “alliance ceremony” with 
my close friend and her boyfriend, as they 
joked about having one instead of a wedding.

Many of my friends from California are in 

some type of open relationship. Because many 
of my friends go to school out of state, they 

A marriage of values

live their lives four months at a time. 
For the four months they are in the 
same town as their significant other, 
whether it is home or college, they 
are monogamous, but as soon as they 
are a plane ride away, the commit-
ment becomes more relaxed. They 
will still Skype, text and visit each 
other, but they also allow their part-
ners and themselves to have flings 
with the people in their immediate 
environment. They try to enjoy the 
time they have with each other for 
what it is without putting the added 
pressure of “the future.”

While the future can be a scary 

concept when in a relationship, 
it can also be exciting and enjoy-

able to imagine. Planning a life 
with the person you love can make 
the future a destination instead 
of an unknown. Michigan rela-
tionships understand this, while I 
feel the relationships I have wit-
nessed in California overlook this 
pleasant aspect.

But 
long-distance 
and 
long-

term relationships are extremely 
hard. I have seen them cause argu-
ments and sometimes ultimately 
destroy the relationships. Those four 
months away during summer are 
a hard obstacle to overcome. But I 
have also seen and experienced the 
jealousy and insecurity that arises 
from allowing someone you love 

to have free reign for a majority of 
 a year.

I have had Michiganders tell me 

they could see me never getting 
married, living in a committed rela-
tionship but never committing to 
something as traditional as a mar-
riage. This is inaccurate. While 
having interesting life experiences 
trumps finding someone to settle 
down with for the next decade, 
Northern Californians and Mid-
westerns both want to find some-
one cool with whom to hang out and 
watch Netflix until we drop dead.

Boston snow storm leads 
to delay in celebration 
after Super Bowl victory

Former leader to 
resign in face of 

corruption charges 

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Carl 

Heastie, a Democratic lawmak-
er from the Bronx, is poised to 
take over leadership of the New 
York state Assembly on Tuesday 
after the resignation of longtime 
speaker Sheldon Silver amid fed-
eral corruption charges.

Heastie had faced as many 

as four other contenders in the 
race to succeed Silver, but his 
final opponent conceded Mon-
day and the Democrats who hold 
the Assembly majority nominat-
ed him with a unanimous vote. 
Republicans hold less than a 
third of the chamber’s seats and 
cannot block his selection.

The 47-year-old Heastie will 

become speaker as the Assembly 

heads into critical budget nego-
tiations with the state Senate 
and Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The 
speakership is one of the most 
important positions in state 
government, with the power to 
set committee assignments and 
control which bills get votes and 
which ones languish.

In a statement, Heastie said he 

was humbled by his colleagues’ 
support.

“He’s a good man and he’ll do 

a good job,” Silver told reporters 
as he left the Capitol on Monday.

Silver’s 
resignation 
comes 

after he was charged with tak-
ing nearly $4 million in payoffs 
and kickbacks over a decade for 
his influence on real-estate leg-
islation and medical grants. The 
Manhattan Democrat says he 
expects to be exonerated and will 
keep his Assembly seat. He led the 
Assembly as speaker for 21 years.

Assembly Democrats had ini-

tially said they would wait until 
Feb. 10 to select Silver’s replace-
ment, to encourage an open 
and deliberative process. That 
changed, however, as Heastie 
quickly locked up support.

“The members felt that ... a 

consensus had emerged,” said 
Assembly 
Majority 
Leader 

Joseph Morelle of Rochester, 
who was briefly a candidate for 
speaker. “We need to move for-
ward on budget deliberations ... 
to get back to work.”

Heastie’s final rival, Assem-

blywoman 
Catherine 
Nolan 

of Queens, conceded minutes 
before the Democrats voted. “I 
lost,” she said. “I accept their 
judgment.”

On Monday, Heastie met with 

a group of lawmakers known 
as the “reform caucus” because 
of their interest in government 
transparency and accountabil-
ity. The meeting was closed to 

reporters and other members of 
the public, however, and Heastie 
declined to answer reporters’ 
questions as he walked in.

In a statement, Heastie vowed 

to pursue a series of ethics 
reforms including a new Office of 
Ethics and Compliance led by a 
non-legislator, new limits on how 
much outside income lawmakers 
can earn, and greater reporting 
of outside income and legislative 
stipends. Outside pay is a central 
issue in the case against Silver.

“We must seize this oppor-

tunity for reform and enact the 
type of lasting change that will 
make the Assembly more open, 
transparent and accountable to 
the voters,” he said in a state-
ment.

Cuomo on Monday suggested 

his own proposals to overhaul 
legislative ethics rules and said 
he wouldn’t sign a state budget 
unless lawmakers take action. 

Parade for the Pats 
must wait as snow 
blankets the city 

BOSTON (AP) — The Super 

Bowl celebration for New Eng-
landers and their beloved Patriots 
will have to wait another day as 
Boston continues to get battered 
by heavy snow.

Mayor Marty Walsh said the 

city will postpone a planned vic-
tory parade through downtown 
until Wednesday morning.

He said the city and team have 

both agreed to hold off on the 
parade due to Monday’s protract-
ed snowstorm, which dumped 
more than a foot of fresh snow in 
the Boston area, making morning 
and evening commutes treacher-
ous.

“We thank everyone for their 

flexibility and patience during 
the planning of this parade and 
we look forward to celebrating 
with Patriots fans during better 
weather on Wednesday,” he said 
in a joint statement with the team.

The city had announced earlier 

that the downtown parade would 
take place Tuesday. But with 
weather continuing to worsen, 
Boston public schools preemp-
tively canceled Tuesday classes, 
the fifth snow day in the past 
week. A decision to cancel the 
parade followed shortly after.

Boston has seen a record 34.2 

inches of snow over seven days, 
according to the National Weath-
er Service. The previous seven-
day record was 31.2 inches in 
January 1996.

Following their 28-24 victory 

over the defending champion 
Seattle Seahawks in Arizona, the 
Patriots flew back to Massachu-
setts as scores of flights in and out 
of Boston’s Logan airport were 
canceled or delayed Monday.

The latest snowstorm didn’t 

stop New Englanders from bask-
ing in the glow of their team’s 
fourth Super Bowl victory.

Todd Penney, of Coventry, 

Connecticut, was still recovering 
from a heady night of celebrating 
as he prepared for work Monday 
morning as a town engineer.

“My voice is very hoarse from 

screaming at the TV. I was all in 

last night,” he said. “It will be a 
lot more fun for me to snowblow 
this morning after the Patriots’ 
win, than if they would have lost, 
that’s for sure.”

Other fans recounted tense 

moments from the rollercoaster 
victory.

“It was an exciting game, a 

nail-biter to the end. You don’t get 
to see games like that very often,” 
said George Vemis, as he cleared 
the sidewalk in front of his vari-
ety store in Whitman, south of 
Boston.

Cheryl Happeny, a business 

analyst from Whitman, said the 
victory is especially satisfying 
because so many people outside 
of New England have been call-
ing the team cheaters since the 
scandal over underinflated foot-
balls in the Patriots’ winning 
game over the Indianapolis Colts 
erupted.

“It was a sweet victory,” she 

said. “I don’t think it will quiet 
the critics. I’m waiting for it to 
heat up again. Everyone hates the 
Patriots because we’re breaking 
so many records. ...We’re like the 
Yankees of the NFL.”

Renovations include 
refurbishments to 
theatre’s marquee

 
KALAMAZOO, 
Mich. 
(AP) 

— Kalamazoo’s State Theatre is 
spending money to make money.

Executive 
director 
Stepha-

nie Hinman is in the midst of a 
renovation at the historic theatre 
that includes refurbishment and 
relamping of the marquee, removal 
of old curtains, rearrangement of 
some seating, cleaning and repair 
of dressing rooms, removal of old 
fixtures and replacement of cables 
behind the scenes.

The work started with fixes that 

addressed the safety and integrity 
of the building and has moved on to 
production systems.

The reason for the activity, 

which began this summer: “We’re 
putting money into it in hopes we 
can get our money back,” Hinman 
told the Kalamazoo Gazette.

“We hope more people buy 

tickets and when more people buy 
tickets to the shows we’re able to 
provide this experience for every-
body,” she said.

Hinman’s father Roger Hinman 

put her in charge of the building 
and guiding its update in April. Her 
wish list of improvements could 
cost up to $5 million. Some of the 
work that’s already taken place 
includes painting and recarpeting 
the green rooms and fixing a roof 
leak. She’s considering adding air 
conditioning, which would allow 
the theater to operate in the sum-
mer.

One of the most visible current 

renovations: putting new curtains 
on the stage.

“The materials are one thing, 

the installation is another,” Hin-
man said. “They don’t just cut them 
down. We had to demo the old ones. 
It’s a process. Everything is weight-
ed and balanced.”

Along with the actual curtains, 

workers have been replacing old 
ropes with new cables for operating 
the curtains, with workers cleaning 
as they go along and salvaging what 
they can of old materials.

Jacob Wargo, production man-

ager at the 1,500-seat theater, said 
one thing they wanted to save was 
the original fire curtain from the 
theater, which was designed by 
Chicago architect John Eberson in 
1927 for $350,000.

“The fire curtain was a signature 

item in all of his theaters,” Wargo 
said. “His go-to thing when he fin-
ished every theater was to put a 
mural on the fire curtain. He’s got 
about six of these Spanish court-
yard theme curtains. The Palace in 
Gary (Indiana) is almost identical 
to this.”

Back stage, workers have also 

removed old lights, many of 
which were wired with old asbes-
tos wiring and work is being done 
to disconnect the huge old light 
panel.

“My god, I love the panel. It’s 

really sweet,” she said, but it has 
to be moved to create more room, 
where space is at a premium.

Hinman said that during the 

renovations, she discovered some-
thing she never knew about the 
theater — that there are a lot more 
dressing rooms and bathrooms 
than she knew about.

Franchise offers 
unique classes for 
local art enthusiasts 

in Traverse City 

TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. 

(AP) — Mix paint, wine, social 
time. Stir with some instruc-
tion. End up a couple of hours 
later with something to hang 
on your wall, and perhaps a 
new friend.

David and Nicole Les-

lie just opened a Painting 
With a Twist franchise in 
Traverse City. The business 
offers 
artist-led 
sessions 

during 
which 
customers 

paint a copy of a picture, 
imbibe if they like and have 

a bit of social time with oth-
ers in the class.

“We 
went 
to 
Colorado 

Springs and went to (a ses-
sion). We had a blast,” David 
Leslie told the Traverse City 
Record-Eagle.

They researched Painting 

With a Twist and discovered 
the 8-year-old company has 
nearly 200 franchises in 28 
states.

The 
concept 
revolves 

around the opportunity for 
anyone, even those with no 
painting experience, to create 
a painting from a blank can-
vas good enough to display at 
home.

The Leslies hired four local 

painters to lead various ses-
sions.

Preparation 
for 
opening 

the new business was hectic, 
David Leslie said.

“I was sweating. I was los-

ing sleep,” he said. “Then sign-
ups started rolling in. They’re 
easing my worries. Everything 
has fallen into place.”

Participants sign up on the 

franchise’s 
website, 
www.

PaintingWithaTwist.com/tra-
verse-city. There, they choose 
from a selection of images in 
the company’s repertoire. That 
choice determines the session 
date. Sessions currently are 
held on Tuesday, Thursday, 
Friday and Saturday evenings 
from 7 to 9 p.m. Another ses-
sion is offered on Saturdays 
from 3 to 5 p.m. The Leslies 
also offer private parties in a 
separate room for groups from 
10 to 35.

FILM NOTEBOOK

By JAMIE BIRCOLL

Senior Arts Editor

Warning: 
The 
following 

discussion of “American Sniper” 
contains mild plot spoilers.

This is a defense of “American 

Sniper.” 
But 
it’s 
also 
more 

than that. It’s an attempt at 
understanding 
the 
role 
of 

cinema in a society so politically 
inclined, so blinded by its own 
ideological trappings that it has 
ceased to examine cinema for 
its cinematic quality but for its 
realism. The loudest proponents 
and detractors of this film alike 
extract the same meaning from it: 
validation of their own political 
leanings. What people have failed 
to see is that “American Sniper” 
rises above politicization to give 
to the public a narrative. Not the 
narrative, mind you, but a single 
perspective: of one American 
soldier 
delegated 
immense 

power, and how that power takes 
its toll on him and his family.

As 
far 
as 
the 
media 
is 

concerned, 
there 
are 
two 

reactions that one ought to have 
after a viewing of the film: “Go 
America!” or “This is propaganda 
bullshit.” Of the former party, 

such subscribers include Blake 

Shelton and Charlie Daniels, 
and of the latter, Michael Moore 
and Seth Rogen. The Twitter-
sphere has tended to align with 
either of these opinions as well. 
If you walked out of the theater 
believing one of these two 
assertions, then one of two things 
has happened: you watched the 
wrong movie or you watched the 
movie the wrong way.

To 
have 
these 
kinds 
of 

opinions 
after 
leaving 
the 

“American Sniper” that I saw is 
to admit that you either went into 
the movie with your own opinion 
already formed or that you only 
selectively paid attention. If you 
went into “American Sniper” 
believing it was an affirmation 
of American military ideals and/
or the idealization of a trained 
killer, then it actually does make 
perfect sense to have that “go 
America” or “fuck war” attitude, 
depending 
on 
your 
political 

leaning. 

But to do so isn’t fair to the 

filmmaker or to yourself. Because 
“American Sniper” doesn’t make 
a single statement about war, 
about America, about Iraq or 
about politics. 

So what is “American Sniper”? 

It’s the single narrative view 
from the perspective of an 
American soldier, raised on a set 
of values, constantly trying to 
reconcile those values, his love 
for his family and his anger with 
the atrocities he commits. And 
director Clint Eastwood makes 
this perfectly clear in the first 
scene:

A sniper peering down his 

scope sees a young boy carrying 
what appears to be an anti-
tank grenade, running toward 
a group of soldiers. Oversight 
cannot confirm if the boy is in 
fact carrying a grenade. They 
defer to the sniper’s judgment. 
He hesitates. The boy prepares to 
throw the object. The sniper has 
his finger on the trigger … cut.

Watch 
the 
hesitation 
in 

Bradley Cooper’s eyes, how tense 
his face is; contrast that with the 
stillness of his body, the calm of 
his breathing. He is at once at 
peace and at war with himself. 
Above all else, this film is about 
internal conflict.

And the film itself captures that 

conflict in its structure. Shifting 
between scenes of intense action 
with apprehensive home life, the 
film, like Kyle himself, is never 
still. There’s always something 
stirring: an enemy militant, a 
lingering memory. These are 
equally legitimate forces that 
eat away at a man’s psyche, at 
Chris Kyle’s psyche. By the time 
Kyle has finished his four tours, 
he is but a vessel of his former 
energetic, amicable self.

Eastwood and screenwriter 

Jason Hall want you to know this. 
Sure, Kyle looks calm, he looks in 
control, but you, the viewer, know 

what he’s seen. You can sense the 
burning underneath his skin. You 
should fear Chris Kyle.

But it’s more complicated 

than that: A news clip of the 9/11 
attacks, the screams of a young 
boy getting his skull drilled in 
— what is one supposed to feel 
then? Do we not echo Kyle’s 
initial enthusiasm or feel his 
sense of duty, his urgency?

All of this goes back to that 

central idea: conflict. As you 
walk out of the theater, you 
should have not one idea, but 
multiple; you, like Kyle, should 
be trying to reconcile all of these 
contradictory 
emotions. 
You 

should sympathize with Kyle’s 
family, you should fear for them. 
Simply, you should think about 
the film you have just seen.

Part of the controversy, I 

feel, stems from one’s inability 
to differentiate between “Chris 
Kyle the man” and “Chris Kyle 
the character.” I have never liked 
the label “based on a true story” 
because, once reading it, the 
viewer can only associate a film 
based on its ability to stay true 
to history instead of evaluating 
it on its own cinematic merits. 
The fact is, I do not know what 
Chris Kyle the man was like. I 
do not know if Bradley Cooper’s 
portrayal of him is accurate. I do 
not know the degree of factuality 
of the events of the film.

What I do know is Cooper’s 

Chris Kyle is a haunted, imposing 
human 
who 
faced 
trauma, 

tragedy 
and 
suffering, 
who 

caused his family pain, who 
could never separate himself 
from the battlefield, who killed 
because he felt it was his duty, 
who killed women and children, 
could look them in the eye even 
if they couldn’t look back. It’s a 
testament to Cooper’s ability that 
he invigorates the film where the 
script is lacking and elevates the 
film above a standard character 
drama into a deep, thorough 
analysis of one man exposed to 
the harsh environment of war.

Cinema 
can 
certainly 
be 

political, but to immediately 
ascribe a film “conservative” 
or “liberal” without analyzing 
what makes the film tick is a 
disservice. “American Sniper” 
is not a political film. It’s a 
contemplative film, a tense film 
and a sad film, but it neither 
upholds nor denies any ideology.

I urge all to see it, not because 

it’s the best film of the year, not 
because of my personal leanings, 
but because it got me to think and 
reflect. Good art, really good art, 
doesn’t agree with you; it rebuffs 
you. It presents an entirely new 
way of looking at something once 
thought fully analyzed. It gets 
you to think, to question, check 
and re-check the facts, discuss, 
debate. 

Roger Ebert, I think, summed 

it up best:

“We live in a box of space and 

time. Movies are windows in 
its walls. They allow us to enter 
other minds, not simply in the 
sense of identifying with the 
characters, although that is an 
important part of it, but by seeing 
the world as another person sees 
it.”

“American Sniper” isn’t taking 

sides. Good film doesn’t take 
sides. It enlightens. It shows the 
best and the worst of society, of 
people.

Political cinema and 
‘American Sniper’

STYLE NOTEBOOK

By MARA MACLEAN

Daily Arts Writer

Designers showcase 

their most 

luxurious looks 

For those who may be slightly 

confused, not to worry: fashion 
month doesn’t actually begin 
until Feb. 12. So, what are all of 
the street style photographers, 
magazine heads and fashion 
houses posting runway videos 
of? 

Some houses decide to create 

couture or pre-fall lines that 
are shown a couple weeks 
before fashion month. Unlike 
the ready-to-wear collections 
that are displayed in New York, 
London, Paris and Milan, the 
couture shows are really only 
directed toward a select few. 

Without the public’s needs 

in mind, designers are free to 
create gowns and suits with 
no monetary restraints. The 
front rows are filled with 
those who can actually afford 
a custom Chanel gown, and the 
collections are a beacon of hope 
in a world that is dictated by 
sidewalk sensibility rather than 
designers’ artistry. Basically, it’s 
a time when Raf Simons of Dior 
can make an entire collection 
with thigh-high latex boots and 
it is considered amazing. 

To 
begin, 
Valentino 

did what it does best with 
serious 
embellishments 
and 

embroidery, 
this 
time 
with 

a Russian twist. Everything 
about the show was romantic, 
from golden bodices to dresses 
stamped with ‘Amore.’ A runway 
highlight was a sky blue velvet 
gown with a sheer high collar, 
which could have easily been a 
costume for Gwyneth Paltrow in 
“Shakespeare in Love.” 

As stated before, the Christian 

Dior show featured latex boots 
— lots of them. In addition to the 
multicolored rubber, there were 
geometric catsuits and painted 
raincoats. Heavily embellished 
minidresses and flouncy skirts 
were also in attendance. The real 
star of the show, the final piece 
— a black structured top, pleated 
embroidered ribbon skirt and 
a peek of colorful boots — 
showcased Simons’s modernist 
eye and ability to re-imagine. 

Amid a runway decorated 

with 
origami 
flowers, 
sock 

booties 
and 
elegant 
hats 

prevailed. 
The 
collection 

paralleled the set nicely — 
simple, well-constructed tweed 
suits with sudden bursts of 
flowers adorning tulle-ridden 
skirts. The show ended with a 
jaw-dropping wedding gowns 
that paired an entirely sequin-
embroidered short-sleeved top 
and a train that looked like a 
white bed of flowers. Lagerfeld 
showed just how effortlessly he 
can reinvent the Chanel woman.

Donatella 
Versace, 
in 
an 

effort to spotlight the woman’s 
curvy form, revealed a line of 
evening dresses with swirling 
insets of nude mesh. While 
the black, white, red and royal 
blue caused a whirlwind on the 
runway, the looks were not as 
exquisite as other collections. 
Striking, yes, as per usual with 
Versace, but, the line lacked 
the 
overwhelming 
aura 
of 

hopeful romance and superb 
craftsmanship found at Dior 
or Chanel. However, her vision 
and intention were showcased 
attractively, as can be seen in 
the white cutout jumpsuit that 
showcased Karlie Kloss’s form. 

Overall, 
the 
Spring 
2015 

Couture shows were entrancing 
spectacles. While you may not be 
able to pick out the latest trends 
or find new ways to wear your 
jeans and sweater, a quick glance 
through some photos from these 
bastions who defend the right 
of creativity and artistry is an 
absolute necessity.

Key & Peele score

By KAREN HUA

Daily TV/New Media Editor

Sketch comedy duo 
deliver skewering 

sports satire

While most of the nation pre-

pared for this last weekend’s 
Super 
Bowl, 

in Hollywood, 
Keegan-
Michael 
Key 

(“The 
Lego 

Movie”) 
and 

Jordan 
Peele 

(“Bob’s 
Burg-

ers”) prepared 
for their par-
ody version of 
the big game.

It’s 
widely 

known that the arts and sports 
worlds don’t mix well, but com-
edy pair Key and Peele, on their 
eponymous 
Comedy 
Central 

show, combined water with oil 
and had us in tears of laughter 
with their football-film intersec-
tional special.

The duo brilliantly weaved an 

hour of sketches into a satirical 
pre-game show, featuring ex-
players Bertram Skilling (Key) 
and Dante Pibb (Peele) on the 
fictional CCB sports network. 
Mocking the intense gusto of 
typical sports reporters, they 
made increasingly bizarre con-
nections between the Patriots 
and Seahawks – finally ending 
in a comparison of the players 
to mac and cheese. Even though 
their content was hilarious, it was 
their performances themselves 
that carried these segments. 
They mocked the obsessive, 
jock-ish nature of sportscasters 
perfectly, and it was their come-
dic timing that made them so 

delightfully awkward.

Following, Key and Peele 

impersonated Seattle Seahawks 
players 
Richard 
Sherman 

(Key) and Marshawn Lynch 
(Peele) at a joint press confer-
ence, where they fully capital-
ized on the eccentric natures 
of each persona. Instead of 
the hyper-stringent (and often 
banal) conversations in typical 
press conferences, they instead 
addressed the issues with this 
year’s Oscar nominations (a sub-
ject Key and Peele’s artsy audi-
ence would appreciate much 
more). In their version, Sherman 
passionately ranted about the 
arbitrary additions and snubs 
for the best director nominees 
– most prominently Ava DuVer-
nay’s for “Selma.” Meanwhile, 
they emphasized Lynch’s usual 
stoic, unresponsive nature when 
he contributed the sole line: 
“biscuits and gravy.”

In their “East/West Bowl” 

sketch, Key and Peele displayed 
the wonders of costume and 
make-up, as well as the versatil-
ity of their looks and their acting 
abilities. In their lineup of player 
introductions, they announced 
themselves with the most ludi-
crous names, such as “Crème de 
la Crème” and “Grunky Peep,” 
with the most farcical accents 
and even more outlandish facial 
hair. Even more hilariously so, 
they cut between real NFL play-
er introductions – real names 
such as Ha Ha Clinton-Dix from 
the Packers, Cornelius “Tank” 
Carradine from the 49ers and 
the Giants’ Prince Amukamara – 
and Key and Peele’s inventions. 
Their serious natures were a 
perfect juxtaposition to Key 
and Peele’s frivolous imperson-
ations. 

Amid 
these 
segments 
of 

light-hearted humor, they also 
incorporated subtle social com-

mentary. In one of Pibb and 
Skilling’s sections, they alluded 
to the NFL and athletic indus-
try’s racist implications. Timo-
thy 
Omundson 
(“Galavant”) 

made a guest appearance, and 
as a white male, he lauded white 
players’ intellectual approach to 
the game versus African-Amer-
icans’ physical method. As he 
puts, the NFL is composed of 
black players possessed of “mag-
ical powers he learned from his 
grandma.”

As the hour went on, the 

sketches 
became 
more 
and 

more bizarre. In their final 
piece, they used animation to 
create a robot named Enos – a 
darkly humorous sketch where 
a robot Super Bowl team led 
by Allison Janney (“Masters of 
Sex”) enslaves the whole world. 

Usually, sports satire exploits 

the 
excessively-enthused 

nature of sports fans. As come-
dians – writers and artists 
whose natures are quite con-
trary to those of football fans – 
it is easy to resort to the stock 
jokes about “balls” and hyper-
masculinity. 
However, 
Key 

and Peele’s characterizations 
are precise – a specificity that 
makes their nuanced humor 
that much more entertaining. 
Their comedic lens offers sports 
and comedy fans alike a ground 
of commonality during this 
Super Bowl season.

Considering the 
power of nostalgia

COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN

W

hen you live in a 
city as full of art-
istry as Ann Arbor, 

you get used to a few things. 
Wild-haired 
old eccentrics 
talking to 
themselves 
on the street, 
hearing more 
than one 
language in 
a single walk 
to class and 
being struck 
with sudden 
nostalgia listening to a song in 
a coffee shop. All these things 
are inevitable, but only one 
will make you cry into your 
latte. 

Nostalgia is a funny thing. 

It’s a feeling that sometimes 
makes you happy, sometimes 
makes you sad and sometimes 
inspires a creativity elicited by 
few other emotions. It’s essen-
tially your mind saying, “Hey 
it’s me again, here’s that mem-
ory you forgot about that made 
you feel something for once.” 
We can’t control it, and once 
it’s in your mind, you can’t stop 
it. The most poignant nostalgia 
for me is always in a form of art, 
be it a song, a painting or a film. 
So why is it that art makes us 
feel the most for the past? 

Perhaps the explanation for 

all this is the inherent sadness 
of the artist. For every sullen 
artist in recent memory with 
enough stature to have several 
hundred Google results after 
searching “quotes by blank, 
you can bet there’s at least one 
about the sting of memories or 
something of the sort. Memo-
ries are poignant things, and 
seem to attach to nearly every-
thing, and that only becomes 
more apparent with age.

When you’re young, it’s hard 

to grasp the concept of nos-
talgia when your life has been 
filled with so few experiences. 
I always thought it was the look 
adults get when they hear “(I’ve 
Had) The Time of My Life” in 
a public place, when their eyes 
glaze over and a small smile 
appears on their lips. As I’ve 
gotten older, I can confirm this 
is true. There are about a mil-
lion things in the world that 
make me zone out of present 
time for a moment and take a 
trip down memory lane, and 
about 999,999 are some formu-
lation of art. These memories 
are often personal, and don’t 
always hold the same effect 
from person to person, but that 
is the beauty of nostalgia. I can’t 
listen to “Brown Eyed Girl” 
without thinking about danc-
ing with my dad at a wedding 
when I was six. Diego Rivera 

once said, “I don’t believe in 
God, but I believe in Picasso.” 
I may not believe in sappiness, 
but I do know that every time 
I look at a Diego Rivera paint-
ing, I’ll think of his print hang-
ing in the kitchen I grew up in 
and smell my mother’s cooking. 
Little associations like these 
are everywhere in the art we 
consume, we just don’t always 
pay them much attention.

Whether we like it or not, 

humans tend to crave the past, 
whether it’s in the art we con-
sume, the people we surround 
ourselves with or the books 
we read. When done correctly, 
there is no harm in nostalgia 
or the feelings it brings along. 
Memories are a part of life, and 
even if they’re painful or not 
favorable, they’ve held enough 
of a purpose to change the 
way we see a little aspect of 
life (even if it’s in the form of a 
Cyndi Lauper song). Next time 
you’re struck down in Espresso 
Royale by a song you danced 
to at prom, don’t wave off the 
emotion as silly. Instead, pay it 
some attention. Everyone cries 
into their lattes at some point in 
life, it’s just one of many quirks 
that makes us human.

Alex G rocks Detroit 
with impressive set

By RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Writer

It’s Friday night and I’m pull-

ing up to the Magic Stick Lounge 
with a good friend, her mother 
driving us as if we’re in middle 
school again, because I’m not 
going to pay for a $50 Uber to 
Detroit. There’s a line circling 
around the block. Maybe that’s 
just the line to buy tickets? my 
friend’s mother offers, though we 
know it’s not. 

We wait outside in the chilling 

20-something degree air, making 
quick conversation with fellow 
fans of the three acts playing 
that night: Teen Suicide, Alex 
G and Pity Sex. I bought the $15 
ticket only to see Alex G, a Tem-
ple University student whose 
first full-length album, DSU, was 
my favorite of 2014. I sincerely 
believe him to be the Inter-
net’s best-kept secret, upload-
ing songs – all recorded on his 
own from his apartment – to his 
Bandcamp since he was 17. Now 
he’s finally getting some atten-
tion from big names like Rolling 
Stone and Pitchfork.

Yet as I’m walking upstairs to 

the venue, which rests comfort-
ably above a bowling alley, pizza 
joint and bar, I hear multiple peo-
ple asking Who the fuck is Alex G?

By the end of the set, they 

know who the fuck Alex G is.

Preceded by the rowdy and 

raunchy Teen Suicide, G’s calm 
onstage persona is refreshing. 
He doesn’t overdo the theatrics 
or engage in typical “rock star” 
behavior. The only thing that 
really comes out of his mouth is 
an appreciative “thanks” after 
every single song; he lets his 
bassist do most of the talking. 
Not to say that G doesn’t have 
stage presence – he is very much 
there. And his music, a dreamy 
mixture of pop, punk and rock, 
is completely engrossing, so any 
stage antics would have detract-
ed from that. 

While performing, he looks 

almost entranced. And as a mem-
ber of the audience, you can’t 
help but feel the same, transfixed 
by this outwardly ordinary young 
adult as he sings about growing 
up and falling in love, then miss-
ing someone and falling out of 
love. His music is about figuring 
things out, and, while he’s per-
forming, that’s exactly what he 
seems to be doing. 

All I could think to say when 

asked about the show later is 
He’s amazing; he’s a god. The 
moment I got back to my room 
I began scrounging the Inter-
net for interviews, photos, live 
performances, new songs – 
anything that would make the 
show last a little longer. I even 
went as far as to look him up on 
Facebook (we have one mutual 
friend, should I add him?) I 
stayed up until 3 a.m. wondering 
why shows like that ever have to 
end.

I got those post-concert blues, 

and I got ‘em bad. Let it be noted 
that most of Alex G’s music 
isn’t available online anymore 
because it’s going to be officially 
released later this year. Let it 
also be noted that I haven’t lis-
tened to anything – seriously, 
anything – but Alex G since the 
showfive days ago. Do you know 
how frustrating it is to worship 
an artist whose songs aren’t on 
YouTube? Who only has one 
album on Spotify? Whose Face-
book profile you can search for 
and actually still find? It’s hard. 

I want nothing more than 

to be back at the Magic Stick 
Lounge, humming along to the 
dreamy melodies of his music. 
But I guess I’ll have to settle for 
a few poor-quality live shows 
uploaded to YouTube. And hey, 
maybe he’ll even accept my 
friend request.

Behind the scenes of 
‘Miss Universe’

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

“Now 
remember, 
these 

women have been working their 
whole lives towards this magical 
moment,” says Natalie Morales, 
news anchor for NBC’s “TODAY” 
show and host of the 2015 Miss 
Universe Pageant in Doral, FL. 
She says it with a smile, the same 
manic grin frozen onto the faces 
of the 88 international beauties. 
But her eyes flash something 
else: a hunger, leering in a way 
that hinted at the cutthroat 
competitiveness 
behind 
the 

girls’ 
blowouts. 
The 
look 

confirms that the contestants 
have not only worked their 
entire lives to get to this stage, 
but that they’re here to beat 
these bitches. For the sake of 
world peace, of course.

Fundamentally, the stakes in 

these competitions are high — 
even now, in a society teeming 
with 
powerful, 
confident 

women, 
the 
word 
“beauty” 

precedes the title “pageant” 
more often than not. Winners 
are 
colloquially 
referred 

to as “beauty queens” and 
professionally as “Miss (fill in 
the blank),” the reigning face of 
perfection. So even without the 
year-long stay in one of Donald 
Trump’s luxury New York City 
apartments, a lifetime’s supply 
of hair and skin products, 
the 
million-dollar 
wardrobe 

and endless plane tickets for 
an 
international 
tour, 
Miss 

Universe wins something much 
more personal: the gratification 
of knowing she is the most 
beautiful woman in the world. 

Losing, then, is a particularly 

nasty pill to swallow, prompting 
feelings, I would imagine, that 
make you sympathize with the 
evil witch in “Snow White.” 
Despite what people have told 
you, regardless of your national 
beauty queen status, you’re no 
longer the fairest in the land 
(or in this case, the universe). 
And if your entire life has been 
devoted to winning this title, 
preening and polishing your 
body like a florist tending to 
his fragile roses, what happens 
when the crown slips from your 
manicured acrylics? 

In the case of Miss Universe, 

the $300,000 crown is not only 
awarded to the contestant, but 
to the country she represents 
— so naturally, both winning 
or losing has a big ripple effect, 
particularly in countries with 
strong pageant cultures. South 
American 
countries 
such 

as 
Colombia, 
Ecuador 
and 

Venezuela 
consistently 
rank 

among Miss Universe finalists 
— Venezuela with seven Miss 
Universe titles, the second-
highest 
number 
of 
winners 

(topped only by USA with eight 
titles). What’s more remarkable 
is that Venezuela — and its 
neighboring 
countries, 
for 

that matter — haven’t always 
participated in Miss Universe. 
Since the pageant’s 1952 debut 
in Long Beach, California, only 
USA, Canada, Germany and 
France have been represented 
every year. Though looking 
at collective tallies, it’s clear 
who the pageant powerhouses 
are: 35 winners were from the 
Americas, 12 from Europe, 10 
from Asia, four from Africa and 
two from Oceania. 

No one knows the cutthroat 

culture 
of 
pageants 
better 

than this year’s Miss Universe, 
Paulina Vega from Colombia. 
The brunette bombshell started 
modeling at eight years old, 
which 
isn’t 
uncommon 
in 

Colombian culture — nor is it 
unusual to catch the pageant bug 
young.

“While 
the 
inherent 

objectification of the contests 
and the values they convey to 
young women often provoke 
outrage and ridicule elsewhere, 
in the Colombian context the 
issue is more complicated,” 
said Carl Bower, a pageant 
photographer, in an interview 
with The Independent. Like 
Americans flooding into football 
stadiums, 
many 
Colombians 

gather 
to 
watch 
pageants. 

“(Colombians) 
often 
have 
a 

vicarious 
relationship 
with 

the queens, clinging to the 
Cinderella fantasy of magically 
transcending poverty,” he said.

Seen in this light, Miss 

Universe — and beauty pageants 
in general — take on a new role 
in the lives of these women. In 
our society, beauty queens have 
become caricatures: airheads 
with phoney-baloney speeches 
and 
spray-tanned 
brats 
in 

“Toddlers in Tiaras.” But for 
others, 
pageants 
cultivate 

confidence and allow for self-
expression in countries where 
opportunities for women are 
drastically limited. To win the 
title of Miss Universe, then, 
is a magical moment indeed: 
a chance to be swept away 
by new experiences, and the 
opportunity 
to 
impact 
the 

world.

Where are the dancing sharks?

I got those 
post-concert 

blues, and I got 

‘em bad.


W

hen Danielle Williams 
was announced in the 
starting lineup for 

the Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team back 
on Dec. 19 
at Crisler 
Center, 
more than 
a few fans 
scratched 
their heads.

The 

sophomore 
guard had played just 81 minutes 
her freshman season, with 
only one start under her belt. 
Days earlier, Williams wasn’t 
even practicing alongside the 
starters — she was on the scout 
team, trying to simulate Canisius 
players. Williams herself was 
surprised when Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico gave her the 
starting nod.

“I think I surprised everyone,” 

Barnes Arico said then. “I told 
(assistant coach) Joy (McCorvey) 
and (assistant coach Megan) 
Duffy, ‘You guys are going to 
have to get her off the prep team 
— she’s going to start today.’ 
And they both looked me like, 
‘What?’ ”

The surprise move was just 

the most notable example of 
something Barnes Arico has 
shown all season: She’s not afraid 
to tinker with the starting lineup 
if she doesn’t like what she sees 
on the court.

Three seniors — forward 

Cyesha Goree, forward Nicole 
Elmblad and guard Shannon 
Smith — have their places in 
the lineup secured, and so 
does sophomore guard Siera 
Thompson.

But the fifth spot hasn’t 

been set in stone all season. 
And it doesn’t matter if you’re 
a defensive specialist like 
Williams, a lights-out shooter 
like freshman guard Katelynn 
Flaherty or a more experienced 
long-range threat like junior 
guard Madison Ristovski. On 
Barnes Arico’s team, everyone is 
weighed equally.

For a team that currently sits 

in the middle of the pack in a 

talented Big Ten, that constant 
reevaluation could be the key to 
staying on the right side of the 
NCAA Tournament bubble.

“I think sometimes kids get 

complacent,” Barnes Arico 
said. “It’s our job as coaches to 
continue to challenge them to 
improve. When we see that other 
kids are really improving, we 
want to reward them and give 
them an opportunity for pushing 
themselves and doing the things 
we ask.”

In December, it was defense 

the Wolverines were lacking. 
Coming off blowout losses to 
Princeton and Notre Dame 
with the Big Ten season on the 
horizon, Michigan desperately 
needed a spark to stop falling 
into early deficits.

Enter Williams. Despite 

averaging just 11.3 minutes while 
making 11 straight starts, she 
picked up 19 steals — including 
six in one game against Eastern 
Michigan — and 32 rebounds. 
With her on the floor in the early 
minutes, the Wolverines’ defense 
thrived in victories over Penn 
State, Michigan State and Ohio 
State.

Most Big Ten squads wouldn’t 

start a player who only plays 
a quarter of the game, but in 
Barnes Arico’s system, any hard-
working player can step into a 
starring role, depending on the 
team’s needs.

Which is why, in Sunday’s 

tough loss to No. 15 Nebraska, 
Ristovski found herself back 
in the starting lineup for the 
seventh time this season. After 
first-half offensive droughts 
plagued Michigan in all six of 
its previous road games, Barnes 
Arico decided her team needed a 
fast start.

The new lineup delivered, 

jumping out to a 20-9 run on 
the strength of five points and 
two assists from Ristovski. The 
Wolverines went stagnant on 
both offense and defense in the 
second half and let the upset 
slip away, but yet again, the new 
lineup did what it was supposed 
to.

Much like Williams’ defensive 

presence, Ristovski’s experience 
on offense brought an edge that 

looked like it might be enough to 
give Michigan its first road win 
against a ranked opponent.

That experience is the same 

reason Barnes Arico is keeping 
one of her best pure shooters on 
the bench.

After starting the first three 

games of the season, Flaherty 
was relegated to sixth-man 
duties after showing her 
inexperience and turning the 
ball over six times in a loss at 
Pittsburgh. She hasn’t made a 
start since, but the freshman 
has excelled in her new role, 
scoring 14.5 points per game and 
shooting 40 percent from beyond 
the arc.

“I fit in well (in that role),” 

Flaherty said. “I’m just happy 
that they have confidence in 
me to do that, and that’s what 
they want me to be. I think I’ve 
been successful at that, and I’ve 
helped the team, which really is 
the most important thing.”

Flaherty’s prolific scoring 

ability — with her signature 
moment being a late game-tying 
3-pointer in the Wolverines’ 
overtime victory over Ohio 
State — has made her a fixture in 
Barnes Arico’s late-game lineup, 

yet another alternative to the 
offense-first and defense-first 
squads.

But for Michigan, it’s not 

about searching for one perfect 
starting lineup.

Barnes Arico cares more about 

evaluating things game by game, 
rewarding players who improve 
and making changes to the 
lineup whenever necessary.

The fact that Flaherty is still 

fifth on the team in minutes 
without making a start since 
November shows that Barnes 
Arico doesn’t use the fifth lineup 
spot as a permanent solution — 
she uses it as a tool to address 
whatever problem Michigan is 
facing lately.

Future success won’t come 

from finding one solution — it’ll 
come from finding the perfect 
offensive and defensive balance 
from the Wolverines’ many 
options.

And if that means throwing a 

scout-team player with limited 
minutes into the starting lineup, 
so be it.

‘M’ gets fresh air 
at outdoor rink

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Writer

For the Michigan hockey 

team, there was a different 
feeling in the air Monday 
afternoon. A cooler one.

Five 
days 
away 
from 
a 

rematch against Michigan State 
at Chicago’s Soldier Field, the 
14th-ranked Wolverines got a 
taste of what hockey is like in 
the elements. The team trekked 
down Packard Road to nearby 
Buhr Park, where it had its first 
exposure to outdoor hockey this 
season.

The change of pace and 

return to hockey’s roots was 
a welcome one for a team in 
midseason form.

“It was a lot of fun,” said 

junior forward Andrew Copp. 
“Getting back to where it all 
started, I’d played at that rink a 
few times growing up, so it was 
cool to go back.”

The 

coolness 
stayed 
throughout 
practice. 
Temperatures 
were 
hovering 
in 

the teens, but 
for Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson, 
it 

doesn’t 
get 

much better.

“It was perfect,” Berenson 

said of the conditions. “It was a 
bit on the cool side, but once the 
players get going, they warmed 
up pretty good.”

Located in the middle of the 

39-acre park and covered with 
an aluminum canopy, the rink is 
far from the fanfare of Yost Ice 
Arena. The video scoreboard, 
speaker system, championship 
banners and grandstands are 
replaced by fresh air, calming 
trees and sunshine.

While 
children 
took 

advantage of Monday’s snow 
day by sledding down a nearby 
hill, the Wolverines made sure 

to get a thrill of their own.

“Once things got going, we 

had a lot of fun out there,” Copp 
said. “There was a lot of hooting 
and hollering, there was a lot of 
energy. It was good to get out 
there.”

Added Berenson: “They liked 

it, and it gives them a bit of a 
taste of what it can be like, too. 
Whether it’s windy or sunny or 
cold, rainy, I’m just trying to 
help our team understand that 
no matter what it’s like, we’re 
going to make the most of it.”

Michigan is also looking to 

make the most of its 2-1 loss 
to the Spartans in Detroit on 
Friday. Though the Wolverines 
hung tight for the entire game, 
the team couldn’t muster up the 
extra urgency to make a big play 
and tie the game.

With 
another 
big 
game 

ahead, and a chance to respond 
to a loss for the first time since 
December, Berenson anticipates 

excitement 
all week, no 
matter 
the 

location.

“We need 

more 
of 

that,” he said. 
“We 
need 

everyone 
to 

play 
with 

that 
fire. 

We’re 
not 

good enough 
to 
have 

passengers and expect to win. 
These games are going to be 
close, these goals are going to 
be precious and we need to take 
care of the puck.”

The long season can grow 

old quickly if things start to go 
awry. Rather than sit back and 
wait for it to happen, Michigan 
looked to get some fresh air 
Monday.

“It’s 
something 
that 
can 

bring the guys together, bring 
the team together and get 
us heading back in the right 
direction,” Copp said. “I think 
we’re all really looking forward 
to it.”

Big Ten’s NCAA Tournament outlook: 
Wisconsin, Maryland, OSU only locks

Michigan on the 
outside looking in 
with six weeks left

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan men’s bas-

ketball team’s game Sunday at 
Michigan State was the first in a 
brutal stretch 
that includes 
four of seven 
games 
on 

the road and 
five of seven 
against teams 
in the top half 
of the Big Ten.

In the end, 

the 
Wolver-

ines dropped 
a heartbreaker 
in 
overtime, 

76-66, falling 
to 6-4 in the 
Big Ten and 
13-9 overall.

As February begins and the 

clock starts ticking on the regular 
season with under six weeks until 
Selection 
Sunday, 
Michigan’s 

NCAA Tournament chances will 
start to move to the forefront of 
the conversation.

The Wolverines are on the out-

side looking in right now, project-
ed as the eighth team out of the 
field in ESPN’s Joe Lunardi’s lat-
est Bracketology update. Though 
their strength of schedule is solid 
at No. 19, their RPI sits at a below-
average 70, and they still have to 
weather trips to Maryland and 
Indiana as well as home games 
against Michigan State and Ohio 
State.

The other games are at Illi-

nois and Northwestern and home 

dates with Iowa and Rutgers. The 
March matchups with North-
western and Rutgers are close to 
must-wins, and Michigan would 
be well served to pick up another 
road win at Indiana, Illinois or 
Maryland.

One of those, plus the two 

March wins, a home win over 
Iowa and a split of Ohio State and 
Michigan State would put the 
Wolverines at 18-12, 11-7 in the 
Big Ten.

That would probably leave it 

up to the Big Ten Tournament. 
Anything less would make for a 
very anxious Selection Sunday.

In six tries, Michigan still does 

not own a top-50 RPI win — the 
closest was against No. 59 Illi-
nois. The Wolverines are also 
still hurting from two ugly losses 
— No. 150 Eastern Michigan and 
No. 183 New Jersey Institute of 
Technology.

Elsewhere in the Big Ten, No. 

5 Wisconsin, No. 17 Maryland 
and No. 20 Ohio State are likely 
the only three locks at this point, 
barring something catastrophic. 
At the bottom, Rutgers, North-
western, Minnesota, Nebraska 
and Penn State are well outside 
the field.

The Daily breaks down the 

chances for everyone in between:

Indiana (6-3 Big Ten, 16-6 

overall, RPI No. 34, SOS No. 
43): The Hoosiers are about as 
close to a lock as it gets, but things 
could still go awry. They struggle 
playing away from home and play 
at Wisconsin and Maryland in the 
next three games. Lose both of 
those, and slip up at home against 
Michigan on Sunday, and Indiana 
is at .500 in the Big Ten. Things 
could get dicey at that point.

Still, the Hoosiers are prob-

ably safe. They boast nice non-
conference wins over RPI No. 17 
Butler (at a neutral site), No. 22 

Southern Methodist and No. 67 
Pittsburgh, and their worst loss 
is at No. 78 Purdue. If they escape 
with road wins over Rutgers and 
Northwestern later this month, 
they should be OK.

Michigan State (6-3 Big Ten, 

15-7 overall, RPI No. 36, SOS 
No. 30): The Spartans are play-
ing well and staying healthy, but 
they still need a few more wins to 
feel secure. After they missed out 
on three big-time chances in the 
non-conference season against 
Duke, Notre Dame and Kansas, 
their lone top-50 win is over Indi-
ana at home.

Michigan State has already 

lost to Maryland twice and only 
plays Wisconsin on the road, 
which would be a tough win to 
get. The Spartans could use a 
home victory over Ohio State. 
Other than that and a trip to 
Indiana, there aren’t a lot of 
opportunities on the table, and 
the Dec. 20 loss to Texas South-
ern was a setback. But Michigan 
State is a No. 8 seed in Lunardi’s 
latest projection, and would 
need to slip up several times to 
play its way out.

Iowa (4-4 Big Ten, 13-8 over-

all, RPI No. 51, SOS No. 10): 
Lunardi has the Hawkeyes as a 
No. 10 seed in his latest bracket, 
eight spots from the bubble. 
Strength of schedule has Iowa 
in good shape, as does a sweep of 
Ohio State and a big road win at 
North Carolina, which is ranked 
No. 10 in the RPI. Moreover, the 
Hawkeyes’ worst loss is at Pur-
due, far from the Incarnate Word 
or NJIT debacles their Big Ten 
counterparts suffered.

Plenty of minefields are still 

there: a home game against a dan-
gerous Minnesota team, a trip to 
Penn State and a home-and-home 
versus Northwestern, any of 
which would be Iowa’s worst loss 

of the season. A home win over 
Maryland would be helpful, but 
not necessary. Because the Hawk-
eyes have taken care of business so 
far, they should be alright.

Purdue (6-3 Big Ten, 14-8 

overall, RPI No. 78, SOS No. 
72): The Boilermakers are Lunar-
di’s sixth team out of the field as 
of Monday, two spots ahead of 
Michigan. They clubbed Indiana 
at home Wednesday and boast a 
decent non-conference win over 
North Carolina State, but they’ll 
have to overcome some ugly 
losses: No. 110 Vanderbilt, No. 129 
Gardner-Webb and No. 198 North 
Florida.

As a result, their strength of 

schedule is low and their RPI even 
lower, and they don’t have anoth-
er chance to knock off Wisconsin, 
the Big Ten’s premier team. At 
least a split of road games at Ohio 
State and Michigan State later in 
February would be nice, plus the 
Buckeyes come to town Wednes-
day. A sweep of Rutgers is likely 
necessary as well, but even then, 
Purdue is squarely on the bubble.

Illinois (4-5, 14-8 overall, 

RPI No. 59, SOS No. 63): Quite 
simply, the Fighting Illini just 
need wins — lots of them. They’re 
not saddled with a terrible 
non-conference loss, and they 
picked up a nice win over Baylor 
in November. But they sit cur-
rently at 4-5 in the Big Ten, and 
this year, even a .500 conference 
record is cutting it close.

Illinois has four tough road 

games remaining: Michigan State, 
Wisconsin, Iowa and Purdue. 
At least one would be nice. The 
Illini also have five very winnable 
home games in Michigan, Michi-
gan State, Rutgers, Nebraska and 
Northwestern. If they avoid a bad 
loss there, they’ll have the oppor-
tunity to play their way in during 
the Big Ten Tournament.
