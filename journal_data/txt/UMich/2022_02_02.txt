The University will provide menstrual 

products across all 670 main floor restrooms 
in all academic and student-facing buildings, 
University spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald told 
The Michigan Daily in an email Thursday.

In November, the Ann Arbor City Council 

approved an ordinance requiring menstrual 
products in all public restrooms — the first 
of its kind in the U.S. The University did not 
immediately make a decision on whether to 
follow the ordinance due to constitutional 
autonomy. 

“Providing 
these 
products 
in 
public 

restrooms on the Ann Arbor campus is no 
small undertaking,” Fitzgerald wrote. “U-M 
has hundreds of buildings that are open to the 
public.”

In August, the University implemented a 

pilot program to offer menstrual products in 
96 on-campus restrooms. Fitzgerald previously 
told The Daily this was conducted to assess 
campus demand and operational costs.

Fired U-M President ofered contract 

for tenured professor in Fall 2022

Mark Schlissel could return as faculty member in MCDB, Microbiology & Immunology 

GRACE BEAL/Daily

A University of Michigan student tested positive 

for meningococcal meningitis, according to an email 
from University of Michigan Chief Health Officer 
Preeti Malani and Lindsey Mortenson, University 
Health service medical directors Thursday night. 

The student was recently present at a Delta Kappa 

Epsilon event on Jan. 20 from 10:30 p.m to 12:00 a.m. 
They also attended an off-campus ticketed event at 
Michigan State University on Saturday, Jan. 22 at the 
Sigma Beta Rho house in East Lansing. The student 
started experiencing symptoms on Monday, Jan. 24.

Meningitis is a rare and serious bacterial infection; 

however, vaccines can prevent it. It involves an 
inflammation of the brain and spinal cord and can 
lead to permanent disabilities. Common symptoms 
of meningitis include a fever, stiff neck, headache, 
rash and vomiting. According to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, most people 
recover, but meningitis can occasionally lead to 
death within a few hours of contracting the disease.

In a Thursday press release from the Washtenaw 

County Health Department, officials urged students 
who may have been in contact with the individual to 
complete an online survey through UHS. According 
to the Health Department, points of contact can 
include being coughed on, being sneezed on, kissing, 
sharing food or being in a crowded space with an 
infected individual.

In the press release, WCHD medical director 

Juan Luis Marquez said the health department is 
currently working with the University to identify any 
close contacts and distribute treatment as needed.

“This is not an outbreak and risk to the larger 

community remains low, but meningococcal 
meningitis is a very serious illness,” Marquez said. 
“We are working as quickly and collaboratively 
as possible to provide information and treatment 
options to anyone with potential and direct exposure 
to the known case.”

The disease is spread by respiratory droplets 

such as those from saliva and is only treatable with 
antibiotics. In their email to the campus community, 
Malani and Mortenson said they are taking the case 
seriously and are encouraging any students who 
are worried they may have been in close contact 
with the positive individual to receive the necessary 
prophylactic antibiotic treatment as a preventative 
measure as soon as possible.

After being removed from his term as 

University of Michigan President earlier this 
month, documents obtained by the Detroit 
Free Press reveal that Mark Schlissel could 
be returning to campus this fall as a tenured 
professor. 

Despite being terminated by the Board of 

Regents as president, Schlissel is entitled to 
his faculty tenure position under his initial 
contract with the University, according 
to an email from U-M spokesperson Rick 
Fitzgerald to The Michigan Daily. Schlissel 
currently retains appointments in the College 
of Literature, Science and the Arts as well as 
the Medical School. 

“Those departments are now in the process 

of officially absorbing him into the faculty and 
determining what his initial duties will be 

as he makes this transition, which was the 
commitment they made in 2014,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “There are a number of details that 
remain to be determined.” 

Fitzgerald wrote retaining tenure was a 

normal process for faculty members returning 
from administrative work. 

According to The Press, Schlissel was 

offered a salary of $185,000 dollars. It is 
still unknown whether or not Schlissel has 
accepted this agreement. 

In early January, Schlissel was fired from 

his position as president after an anonymous 
complaint in December 2021 led to an internal 
investigation, which revealed that he had been 
engaging in an inappropriate relationship with 
a University subordinate. This investigation is 
ongoing, as the University’s Board of Regents 
is currently investigating if Schlissel obtained 
University funds to engage in this relationship, 
Regent Sarah Hubbard, R-Lansing, confirmed 
in an interview with The Daily last week. 

Hubbard said the Regents expect to know 

the results of the investigation relatively soon 
and will proceed accordingly. 

‘We certainly don’t expect this to be 

something that takes six months to a year, it’s 
something I would hope to get some feedback 
on, you know, in (the coming) weeks,” 
Hubbard said. “I don’t have a specific end date, 
and until we know what they find, we won’t 
know what to do with the information.” 

Hubbard said initial results of the 

investigation – which revealed over 118 pages 
of email and text correspondence between 
Schlissel and his subordinate – led the regents 
to a unanimous decision to terminate. 

“Once the board saw the nature of the 

emails, we all had a lot of concerns about the 
nature of the relationship, particularly given 
the policy that was put in place last summer 
related to the supervisory relationship,” 
Hubbard said. 

Ultimately, this termination did not revoke 

Schlissel’s tenure faculty appointment. 

The obtained documents require Schlissel 

to teach one class a year if conducting research, 
and two classes per year if not. Additionally, 
Schlissel would not begin instruction until 
the 2022-2023 school year. Prior to teaching, 
he will need to conduct research and obtain 
grants. In addition to teaching, he will be 
relied on to serve on faculty committees and 
mentor students.

Bethany Moore, chair of Microbiology 

and Immunology at the University, wrote in 
the letter obtained by The Press that Schlissel 
must adhere to the conditions outlined in the 
letter.

“Your appointment will be on a twelve-

month basis with major effort to be 
determined by discussion with the chair 
and followed up in writing,” Moore wrote. 
“Established research-active faculty in the

LSA SG condemns rise in global anti-Muslim bigotry, supports installing bidets

LSA Student Government passed 

two resolutions that intend to create 
a more accepting environment for the 
Muslim community on the University 
of Michigan campus. One of the 
resolutions calls for condemning the 
global rise of Islamophobia, and the 
other supports a bidet initiative to make 
public restrooms more accomodating 
for Muslim students.

The need to address Islamophobia on 

campus was brought to attention when 
a copy of the Quran was damaged at 
Arizona State University.

Bilal Irfan, LSA SG representative and 

LSA freshman, said the resolution aims 
to break the pattern of Islamophobia 
worldwide, starting in Ann Arbor.

“(The first resolution) kind of looks 

into the global trends of Islamophobia,” 
Irfan 
said. 
“(The 
resolution) 
also 

extensively cites some of the things from 
the Islamophobia Working Group (IWG) 
and what they found on Islamophobia 
on campus.” 

The IWG was established in 2016 

to address Islamophobia in the U-M 
community and around the country. The 
IWG aims to create a safe environment 
for Arab, Muslim and MENA (Middle 
East and Northern Africa) students.

Irfan said he and Maria Wajahat, LSA 

SG representative and LSA freshman, 
drafted the resolution in response to the 
ASU vandalism incident. 

Wajahat believes the new resolution 

will create a safer environment for 

Muslim students. 

“(The ASU vandalism) invokes a lot 

of fear in Muslims, especially on college 
campuses, and it’s not something 
that’s unfamiliar to the University of 
Michigan,” Wajahat said. “There’s no 
saying that it won’t happen again, or 
that it won’t happen here the way it did 

at ASU. I think that this was a really 
good way to sort of get ahead of that 
and try to make Muslims feel safer on 
campus and just feel more accepted.”

Irfan also said other Islamophobic 

attacks rattled the country during 
the first two weeks of December such 
as an arson attack at a mosque in 

Albuquerque, N.M. on Nov. 29 and death 
threats against U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar. 
He argued the University has not done 
enough for Muslim students in recent 
years, and the resolution is a small step 
towards change.

Two resolutions approved to increase inclusivity for Muslim community

ADMINISTRATION

Amid a nationwide surge of 

COVID-19 cases, the University 
of Michigan announced a new 
policy requiring either proof of 
vaccination or a negative COVID-
19 test for all indoor athletic 
events. The new requirement is 
in addition to 
the 
existing 

face 
covering 

mandate 
while 
inside 

University 
buildings.

The 
policy 

specified that 
those 
who 

tested positive 
for 
COVID-

19 
will 
be 

required 
to 

show a public 
health release 
letter or a letter 
from a doctor 
that is dated 
within 90 days 
of the sporting 
event. 
The 

policy will be 
in effect until 
further notice, 
according 
to 

the Michigan 
Athletics 
website.

LSA freshman Sara Taub is 

on the Michigan dance team 
and 
performs 
at 
women’s 

basketball games. Taub said the 
new requirements made her feel 
more safe at athletic events and 
was glad people were still able to 
attend, despite the surge. 

“You want a lot of people 

coming to the games to support 
the teams, and you just want to be 
as safe as possible so that we can 
keep going to the games because 

last year that was impossible,” 
Taub said. “I think that support 
is so important, especially for 
(dance). We just had our nationals 
… it was so much better being able 
to experience that energy live, in 
person.” 

Taub 
also 
said 
random 

asymptomatic 
testing 
would 

make her feel more comfortable 
attending all events on campus. 

“Other universities (are) doing 

random testing for students, and 
I feel like … that would be a more 
effective way (to minimize the 
spread of COVID-19) than just 
kind of testing when you want to or 
when you need to,” Taub said. “I just 
think that that would help eliminate 
the amount of cases or just bring 
attention to the positive ones.”

In an email to The Michigan 

Daily, Associate Athletic Director 
Kurt Svoboda wrote that athletic 
events will accept photo vaccine 

cards, and the policy will remain 
until further notice. Additionally, 
at-home rapid tests will not satisfy 
the negative test requirement. 

“In 
early 
January, 
the 

requirements were put in place 
in anticipation of rising cases 
stemming from COVID’s omicron 
variant while striving to provide 
the safest and best possible 
in-person experiences for our 

students and other community 
members,” 
Svoboda 
wrote. 

“Other indoor ticketed events 
had previously instituted these 
policies.”

Engineering 
freshman 

David Grover said he went to 
the Michigan wrestling match 
against Penn State Friday. Grover 
also said he knows more people 
who tested positive compared to 
last semester, and he believes the 
virus will become as common as 
the flu..

“Yeah, it’s a lot more intense 

than it was (last semester),” Grover 
said. “I haven’t really had anybody 
in my family or friend group that 
had ever (tested positive) … (I 
think) it’s gonna become like the 
flu where people get it every year, 
it kind of rolls through and then 
it’ll subside for a bit. And there 
will be vaccines that come out that 
change yearly, depending on what 

variant there is 
and it’s just kind 
of what it is at 
this point.”

Grover 
said 

he wasn’t asked 
to show proof 
of 
vaccination 

or a negative 
test 
when 
he 

went 
to 
the 

match. He said 
while he thinks 
vaccination 
and 
testing 

are 
effective 

in 
minimizing 

the spread of 
COVID-19, he is 
skeptical of its 
enforcement.

“As 
far 
as 

sporting events 
go, because I 
didn’t get asked 
for any proof 
of 
vaccination 

or 
testing, 
I 

can’t speak on whether any of 
the people who didn’t go through 
that student entrance (followed 
the University’s policy),” Grover 
said. “I didn’t see if there were 
any altercations, I didn’t see if 
anybody just went through. I have 
no idea if they actually did check 
it. So I don’t think I can speak 
on whether it’s even changing 
anything inside of the event.”

The Michigan Daily (ISSN 0745-967) is publishing weekly on Wednesdays for the 
Winter 2022 semester by students at the University of Michigan. One copy is available 
free of charge to all readers. Additional copies may be picked up at the Daily’s office 
for $2. If you would like a current copy of the paper mailed to you, please visit store.

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., 

visited the University of Michigan 
Matthaei 
Botanical 
Gardens 

Wednesday to discuss the impacts 
of the Great Lakes Restoration 
Initiative (GLRI) following the $1 
billion in federal infrastructure 
funding the initiative received last 
year.

Dingell 
represents 
Michigan’s 

12th Congressional District in the 
U.S. 
House 
of 
Representatives. 

She was joined by members of 
various environmental and wildlife 
organizations, 
such 
as 
nonprofit 

organization Ducks Unlimited and the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to hear 

how GLRI funding has supported 
those groups’ local conservation 
efforts.

The 
$1 
trillion 
bipartisan 

infrastructure bill, which was 
signed into law by President Joe 
Biden last November, allocated an 
additional $1 billion to the (GLRI). 
Established in 2009, the GLRI 
works to protect wildlife and restore 
habitats by eliminating threats to 
the Great Lakes ecosystems such 
as pollution, contamination and 
invasive species.

Kyle Rorah, Ducks Unlimited 

regional director of public policy, 
said the GLRI as well as the Great 
Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration 
Act of 1990,vital to collaborative 
conservation efforts, benefitted 
Americans across the country 
despite the initial monetary costs 
that go into these programs. 

“These 
programs 
are 
just 

incredible,” Rorah said. “When 
you think about the multiple 
benefits that ecological restoration 
provides communities, the value 
delivered back to society (and) to 
wildlife, far outpaces the upfront 
investment.”

The basement in my childhood home 

was equipped with a Magnavox box TV, 
a GameCube and a PlayStation 2. The 
furniture was old, and the basement 
was prone to flooding, but it didn’t mat-
ter so long as my older brother and I had 
the TV and at least one console. Before 
the days of homework and exams, my 
brother and I would spend every day 
after school in the basement: He would 
sit on the ottoman in front of the televi-
sion while I curled up in the armchair 
behind him and, for hours, watched 
him play video games. He played any 
number of games — “Super Mario Sun-
shine” or “The Legend of Zelda: Twi-
light Princess” were the most popular, 
and if I was lucky enough, he’d let me 
play “Lego Star Wars” with him. 

I spent years consuming games but 

spent hardly any time playing. By the 
time I reached my tween years, I had 
gotten decent at “Lego” games, “Ani-
mal Crossing” and “Super Smash Bros. 
Brawl,” and I was familiar with the 
mechanics of the Wii and PlaySta-
tion. But I intimately knew “Legend of 
Zelda” and “Infamous” games and oth-
ers less suited to a little girl than “Ani-
mal Crossing.” I knew how to solve the 
puzzles in those games. I knew the lore 
and character biographies, and I knew 
that if you fell in water in “Infamous,” 
death was immediate, so steer clear. 
I watched the early days of YouTube 
gamers like ChimneySwift11 and iHas-
Cupquake, and in recent years, I fell in 
love with Polygon’s “Unraveled” series. 
I had all the theoretical knowledge it 
took to be a “real” gamer, but my broth-
er was the gamer, not me. No matter 
how much interest I showed, the video 
games underneath the tree on Christ-
mas morning weren’t addressed to me. 
So what was a young girl to do?

She gets smart. She learns every-

thing she can about video games since 
she can’t afford to buy them herself, 
and she flexes that knowledge at every 
opportunity. And it surprises people — 
men, mostly. After they undergo a brief 
period of wondering how a woman 
could have so much knowledge about a 
sphere mostly exclusive to them, there 

are generally two ways they follow 
through. One, they accept it and carry 
on the conversation with me. Two, and 
perhaps the more common option, is 
the testing.

If I know so much about one video 

game, then they want to see if I know 
everything about its predecessors and 
spin-off games. As a young woman, I 
am not new to men’s attempts to trip 
me up in an arena they do not deem 
suitable for me, but I never face it quite 
so poignantly as I do within the gaming 
sphere. Their singular desire is to act as 
gatekeeper to the academia of the video 
game community — meaning I am not 
allowed in unless I prove myself intel-
ligent enough and otherwise ought to 
be kept on the fringes of their culture. 
And while I don’t mind saying that I 
can hold my own when it comes to dis-
cussion about a game’s story or char-
acters, I will also admit that I begin 
to trip up when it comes to gameplay. 
If someone asked me to speak on the 
particular mechanics, special items or 
battles in, say, “The Legend of Zelda: 
Twilight Princess,” I would be at a loss 
because even though I watched my 
brother play through the entire game, 
I have never laid hands on a “Legend 
of Zelda” game. All these years later, I 
still find myself wondering why?

That why has a number of answers, 

but advertising is at its core. Before the 
1980s, video games were pretty neutral 
due to a lack of data. Yes, the industry 
was still largely male-dominated, but 
“ 
there was hardly any player research 
being conducted.” No developers knew 
who exactly was playing the games, so 
the games were made for everybody. 

Enter the 1983 video game crash: 

a recession in the industry caused by 
over-saturation. Consumers stopped 
purchasing games, and the industry 
lost money by the billion until a little 
company called Nintendo stepped in. 
Aiming to avoid repeat over-saturation 
and to create a more niche market, Nin-
tendo conducted wide-scale market 
research into who was buying and play-
ing the most video games — or toys, as 
they were marketed at the time to avoid 
the defunct title of “video game.” And 
what did they find? Boys were play-
ing more. It follows that, in the ’90s, 
“Video games were heavily marketed 

as products for men, and the message 
was clear: No girls allowed.” Marketing 
images and campaigns often featured 
hypersexualized women, the notion 
that increased gaming skill could win 
you more female attention and the 
age-old joke that video games were an 
escape from the old ball and chain. 

This is why video games under the 

Christmas tree were never addressed 
to me as a child. They were good gifts 
for my brother — tools for him to be a 
regular little boy —while I was given 
baby dolls, which were tools for me to 
be a good mother. 

As a future homemaker, I was repre-

sented in countless Disney princesses 
rescued from the clutches of evil only 
to become wives and mothers. The only 
kind of women I saw in the video games 
my brother played were these same 
damsels in distress. To my child-mind, 
Zelda and Princess Peach were prin-
cesses locked away in towers, waiting 
for Link or Mario to come save them 
from Ganon and Bowser. Even when 
the rare strong female character, like 
Lara Croft or even Samus Aran, did 
make an appearance, she was hyper-
sexualized and seemingly animated for 
the male gaze.

The “gamer girl” identity is reflected 

in this representation. Somehow both 
fetishized and scorned, the internet’s 
definition of a gamer girl is, like Lara 
Croft, welcome in the gaming commu-
nity, yet is more ornament than player 
and is non-threatening enough to be 
held at arm’s length within the commu-
nity. She is an unfortunate, unrepre-
sentative catch-all term that has been 
applied far too liberally to myself and 
other female gamers. 

In 2014, Gamergate — the online 

harassment campaign in which “thou-
sands of people in the games commu-
nity began to systematically harass, 
heckle, threaten, and dox several out-
spoken feminist women in their midst” 
— revealed just how dangerous video 
game culture actually was for women, 
and particularly for transgender gam-
ers. The campaign produced transpho-
bic memes in order to push its agenda 
and highlighted just how long trans-
gender women had been speaking 
against sexism and harassment in the 
community. When Gamergate pulled 

back the curtain on the utterly violent 
misogyny embedded in video game 
culture, it was no longer surprising 
why women were always kept on the 
fringes. If the games weren’t marketed 

towards us, if we didn’t see ourselves 
represented in them and if men would 
resort to violence to keep us out, then 
what was the point? Why try to indulge 
in a culture that obviously didn’t want 
us when there were so many other are-
nas in which we could be experts? Like 
cooking. Or child-rearing or homemak-
ing, if that’s more your speed.

Well, “hell hath no fury like a woman 

scorned” and all that. Men in the gam-
ing industry can try to keep women out, 
but there will always be some who slip 
through the cracks. Women like the 
members of Dignitas, “regarded as the 
world’s best all-female ‘Counter-Strike: 
Global Offensive’ team,” who practice 
for six hours every day in order to keep 
fighting for their place at the esports 
table. Women like Twitch streamer 
Pokimane, who in 2021 was revealed to 
have made 1.5 million dollars over 26 
months, not accounting for merchan-
dise or sponsorship revenue. Women 
like Kim Swift, who developed 2007’s 
hugely popular “Portal,” or Alyssa Fin-
ley, the executive producer of “Bio-
shock” and “Bioshock 2,” the first two 
games in a franchise that has sold over 
34 million games as of 2019. 

Women will continue to pursue 

video games, and video game culture 
will continue to make us feel that we 
are not “real” gamers or reduce us to 
“gamer girls” because of our gender 
identity. Time and time again, I have 

faced men that want to keep me out of 
gaming because they do not deem me 
serious enough — and this is a univer-
sal experience for women in the video 
game community. That is the upsetting 
truth of our current time. However, I 
maintain that women do not have to 
be esports champions or top-earning 
streamers or developers of some of the 
most popular video games of all time 
to prove that they are “real” gamers. 
Consider this a call to arms: All you 
have to do is play the games you like 
and keep pushing. When a man claims 
that you have no space in the gaming 
community because you play “Animal 
Crossing,” I want you to double down 
and devote your skills to building your 
dream island. When a man quizzes you 
on your “Call of Duty” knowledge, I 
want you to challenge him to a game 
and beat him. 

Or, if you’re like me, learn every-

thing you can about video games and 
then ask for your first “Legend of 
Zelda” game for Christmas. It will be 
the second-ever video game addressed 
to you under the Christmas tree, both 
received in the year and a half since you 
turned nineteen, and both will be from 
your big brother.

Ricky Gervais’s bewildering brand of sentimentality in ‘After Life’

Hear me out: ‘Dora and the Lost City of Gold’ is an unexpected masterpiece

Content warning: death, suicide
Ricky Gervais (“Scooby-Doo and 

Guess Who?”) is not widely known for 
having a big heart. He is perhaps most 
famous for his rant against the hypocri-
sy of Hollywood elites at the 2020 Gold-
en Globes, or maybe for his scorching 
standup comedy, in which he mercilessly 
dissects touchy subjects, most notably 
religion. The edgy elements of Gervais’s 
persona are certainly on display in the 
third and final season of “After Life,” 
which he writes, directs and stars in. 
However, the numerous tear-jerking, 
emotionally 
devastating 
and 
heart-

warming moments that accompany his 
blunt sense of humor are truly surpris-
ing. What’s even more puzzling is how 

well these features complement each 
other.

“After Life” season three is the culmi-

nation of Tony Johnson’s (Gervais) emo-
tional journey following the loss of his 
wife, Lisa (Kerry Godliman, “Frayed”) 
to breast cancer. Throughout the series, 
Tony battles suicidal thoughts and 
struggles with finding his purpose on 
earth now that his soulmate is gone. His 
friends at his workplace, the local news-
paper the Tambury Gazette, and out-
side the office do their best to help Tony 
while simultaneously striving to find 
happiness themselves. 

In the first season, Tony’s coping 

strategy was to say whatever came to his 
mind and treat others however he want-
ed, because without Lisa, nothing mat-
tered anymore. Unsurprisingly, this way 
of life did not make Tony feel any better, 
and he barely escaped suicide, thanks to 

the love of his dog, Brandy (Anti, “Hit-
men”), and a few other friends. Over the 
course of season three, Tony finds a new 
strategy: trying to achieve contentment 
by making the world a better place. He 
gives beneficial advice to his friends and 
performs acts of kindness for deserving 
strangers without abandoning his signa-
ture fearless insults when dealing with 
genuine assholes.

According to Gervais himself, the 

overarching message of “After Life” 
season three is to make the most of life 
while you can. It is no doubt a challenge 
to convey such a broad and universal 
idea through any artistic medium, let 
alone a six-episode season of television. 
However, Gervais cleverly imbues the 
theme by using several tactics, including 
story structure, character development 
and humor. 

The first is the subtle, slice-of-life 

nature of the show. Gervais does not 
hammer down the worldview with pre-
cise and heavily structured plotlines in 
which Tony might learn something new 
at the end of every episode. Instead, he 
lets the idea breathe in the natural and 
deep conversations between charac-
ters, in addition to spending time on 
seemingly mundane activities, such as 
walking the dog or joking around with 
friends. Importantly, Gervais also makes 
clear that living life to the fullest is not 
an easy task. Tony often struggles to get 
out of bed in the morning and can do so 
only after watching old home videos of 
his wife. Gervais is also careful to avoid 
preaching, keeping his message relat-
able with his aforementioned style of 
comedy. 

“After Life” takes advantage of Ger-

vais’s comedic personality to create a 
satisfying ending to the series in which 

Tony’s transformation is palpable. It 
is rewarding to see a character who 
started off the series so cynical (even 
willing to lose his life in order to per-
sonally ridicule two petty thieves) 
ultimately become a relatively selfless 
individual. Without spoiling too much, 
one of the most touching scenes in the 
season occurs when Tony puts aside his 
fervent atheist beliefs to make someone 
feel better in the moment.

Through “After Life,” Gervais expert-

ly demonstrates that you never have to 
put limits on your creative work. Why 
not juxtapose gut-busting inflamma-
tory humor with the themes of depres-
sion and the meaning of life? Who says 
that you can’t create a captivating show 
without proven structure? The show 
therefore serves as both an inspiration 
for viewers and creatives through its 
beautiful and innovative story.

My earliest exposure to Nickelodeon 

was confined to Nick Jr., their children’s 
programming channel. Turning the 
channel to Nick Jr. meant getting plenty 
of “Blue’s Clues,” “Dora the Explorer” 
and Face, the sentient Nick Jr. mascot and 
cartoon screen. Although “Blue’s Clues” 
has semi-recently slid its way back into 
pop culture relevance, and any kind of 
Face revival seems (tragically) unlikely, 
I feel the need to pivot everyone’s atten-
tion to a groundbreaking, seemingly 
unnoticed “Dora the Explorer”-related 
phenomenon that burst into the world in 
2019: the live-action “Dora” adaptation 
“Dora and the Lost City of Gold.” People 
don’t talk about this movie enough, and I 
would like to change that.

I saw “Dora and the Lost City of 

Gold” in theaters with my friend from 
high school. We have a long tradition of 
going to weekday matinees of movies 
that at least one of us is skeptical about. 
I can’t remember which one of us picked 
“Dora,” but I do know that we were both 
somewhat hesitant. We walked in with 
the lowest of expectations but were 
greeted with 102 minutes of entertain-
ing adventure and, admittedly, excellent 
humor. We were the only teenagers in a 
theater full of kids and parents, and we 
were laughing harder than anyone else. 
It was, for us, an unexpected master-
piece.

“Dora and the Lost City of Gold,” while 

based on the animated show, moves into 
a realm beyond Dora’s formulaic animat-
ed world. The film follows Dora (Isabela 
Merced, “Sweet Girl”), now 16, as she 
moves from her home in the Amazon jun-
gle to the LA area to live with her cousin 
Diego (Jeff Wahlberg, “Cherry”) — an 
iconic animated character in his own 
right. Having spent her entire life in the 
jungle raised by her (hilarious) archaeol-
ogist parents, Cole (Michael Peña, “Tom 
and Jerry”) and Elena (Eva Longoria, 
“Desperate Housewives”), Dora is bril-
liant, enthusiastic, curious and totally 
naïve. As expected, she has some trouble 
fitting into her new high school. But the 
film takes a turn when Dora is kidnapped 

by mercenaries — along with Diego and 
two of their classmates, Sammy (Mad-
eleine Madden, “The Wheel of Time”) 
and Randy (Nicholas Coombe, “68 Whis-
key”), who inadvertently end up in the 
box with Dora and are flown back to the 
South American jungle. Dora must lead 
her ragtag bunch through the jungle to 
find her parents, who have gone missing 
looking for Parapata, a fabled lost city 
built by the Incas.

What a plot, right? Because there 

are so many moving parts throughout 
“Dora,” it tends to pull from a number of 
different genres. It’s a comedy, but there’s 
a touch of high school identity crisis, and 
a touch of dramatic Indiana Jones-esque 

adventure. There’s also a, ahem, trippy 
scene where they get caught in a spore 
field — a scene that, frankly, has to be 
seen to be believed. And it ends with a 
musical number. There’s a lot going on.

The film has layers, different things 

that can be enjoyed by different audienc-
es. Yes, there is a song about poop. Yes, 
there is a scene where Dora dances like 
various animals in a high school audito-
rium while dressed like the sun. But what 
personally caught me off guard about the 
film was how self-aware it is. The film is 
entirely aware of its roots as a children’s 
show and is aware of its position as a film 
meant to be enjoyable rather than life-
changing. (I mean, I found it life-chang-
ing, but that’s just me.) Our first glimpse 
of teenage Dora shows her moving deftly 
through the jungle in her iconic pink 
shirt and orange shorts, naming species 
and pointing out wildlife. She points out 
a golden poison frog (whose skin is coat-
ed in a toxin that causes paralysis) on a 
branch, stares straight into the camera, 
and says, in the spirit of her younger ani-
mated counterpart, “Can you say severe 
neurotoxicity?”

This was the moment that “Dora and 

the Lost City of Gold” had me. This was 
the moment where, in that theater, I was 
completely sold on this movie. “Dora” 
was all-in on its premise and its source 
material, and I was all-in on “Dora.” And 
it only got better from there.

Part of what makes this movie work is 

that, even with the poop song, the themes 
of the film are shockingly strong. Dora’s 
parents initially send her to live with her 

cousin’s family because of an incident 
involving jumping across a ravine. As 
it turns out, even believing in yourself 
doesn’t alter the Earth’s pesky gravita-
tional pull — a direct challenge, almost, 
to the animated show’s attitude toward 
danger. The film establishes real stakes 
and real danger: There is no illusion of 
invincibility the way that there is in the 
animated show. No one dies in the film, 
but between the armed mercenaries, 
natural hazards and ancient Incan booby 
traps, the threat of death is there. (Luck-
ily for our mostly fearless crew, Dora also 
used to sit around and think about what 
to do about quicksand).

Within the external stakes, “Dora” 

also sets up effective internal stakes. At 
the heart of the film is the relationship 
and dynamic between Dora and Diego. 
Despite being best friends when they 
were young, ten years is a long time: Dora 
hasn’t changed at all, but Diego has. (You 
know how everyone becomes jaded and 
ashamed of themselves as soon as they 
hit middle school? Well, Dora never went 
to middle school, and Diego did.) While 
some of the other characters are a little 
one-dimensional, Diego and Dora are 
strong and complex, and their charac-
ters’ relationship reflects that. When 
they’re at the high school, Diego is ter-
rified of how people think of him and is 
embarrassed by how unapologetic Dora 
is. In the jungle, though, the only thing 
that matters is their loyalty to each other, 
and the ability to have each other’s back.

Face masks are my favorite acces-

sory. Masks are a barrier between 
me and an outside world filled with 
strangers and infectious diseases. 
When the University of Michigan’s 
administration mandated facial cov-
erings in classrooms, recreational 
buildings and common areas for the 
Winter semester, I was happy to com-
ply — wearing masks has been proven 
to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by 
protecting one’s self and others from 
the very transmissible virus. But, 
I couldn’t help but wonder how my 
favorite accessory has affected my 
socialization and education over the 
past two years.

In an interview with The Michi-

gan 
Daily, 
Public 
Health 
junior 

Sophie Busch, a facilitator for men-
tal health group Wolverine Support 
Network, said that mask-wearing 
makes the student body more antiso-
cial. She emphasized how it increases 
the uncertainty of interacting with 
strangers and forces us to second-
guess ourselves whenever we think 
we recognize someone.

Selfishly, I love the “masking” pow-

ers of a face mask. Masks provide me 
with a sense of invincible anonym-
ity and enable my more hermit-like 
tendencies. But I may be too quick 
to love the lack of socializing on a 
masked campus. A University of Chi-
cago social experiment that assigned 
morning commuters to either a quiet 

car or a talkative bus found that intro-
verts often “mistakenly seek soli-
tude.” The distant social connections 
made on a short bus ride resulted in 
higher reports of positive experiences 
and positive mood, even for intro-
verted participants who predicted the 
opposite result. As naturally social 
beings, humans (especially college 
students) are not meant to avoid the 
thousands of strangers we may see 
each day. Even introverts need simple 
(albeit awkward) daily interactions on 
campus.

Nonetheless, after years of isola-

tion, going back out into the world 
feels strange and difficult. “A lot more 
people have social anxiety than they 
used to,” Busch said. “I remember at 
the beginning of the year a bunch of 
people were talking like, ‘Oh, I don’t 
know how to make small talk any-
more, I’m so used to only talking to 
people I’m close with, it’s really hard 
to talk to people I don’t know.’” 

During 
Busch’s 
freshman 
year, 

without masks or social distancing, 
people naturally started conversa-
tions in classes. Today, strangers rare-
ly talk unless hassled by a professor. 
Masks only exacerbate difficulties 
connecting with our peers. Masking 
up disallows lip-reading and prevents 
us from using visual communication 
aids. Especially in quiet spaces, using 
visual cues is incredibly important in 
decoding others’ words. We can no 
longer make a snide joke about a pro-
fessor or say “hi” to the cute classmate 
across the room without screaming. It 
often feels easier to stay silent.

However, 
non-verbal 
expression 

makes up 55% of our interpersonal 
communication, making every facial 
twitch far more important than we 
realize. As we develop, we learn to 
focus on the lower half of the face to 
process key emotions like fear, sur-
prise and anger. With masks on, we 
aren’t as attuned to people’s emo-
tions. We can’t tell who is panicking 
about the midterm, outraged by the 
same political issues, excited for the 
big game or behind on the readings. In 
college, we build friendships and rela-
tionships off of these seemingly insig-
nificant shared experiences. Without 
facial recognition, experiences are 
solitary. 

In countries like Iran, where many 

women wear face-covering niqabs, 
eye contact and expression is the main 
outlet for nonverbal communication. 
Iranian journalist Kamin Moham-
madi notes that this investment in eye 
contact unsettles strangers in West-
ern Europe. Americans and Western 
Europeans do not typically hold eye 
contact except when intensely flirt-
ing. When we hold eye contact with 
another human, the brain has to grap-
ple with the consciousness of another. 
As the brain processes this unfamil-
iar intensity, it produces hormones 
similar to “butterflies in our stom-
ach.” Mohammadi hints that “mask-
wearing and eye-gazing,” if it cannot 
establish emotional solidarity, could 
at least make flirting a silent film of 
serotonin. With effort, eye contact 
alone can express intense emotions 
beyond romance. Simple shifts of 

the eyebrows and eyelashes can sig-
nify fear, disgust, anger and joy. If 
we focus on our own eye movements 
(even when it feels ridiculous), and 

those of others, we can easily express 
our emotions and eventually rebuild 
the sense of connection we’ve lost 
over the pandemic. 

Since many of us are not acclimated 

to emoting with the eyes (or making 
eye contact at all), masking up pro-
vided us newfound freedom to look 
miserable when we feel miserable. I 
scowl at annoying customers at work, 
clench my teeth at professors and 
frown through my homework.

Keeping a smile on your face out of 

mere obligation is emotionally drain-
ing and physically exhausting. But 

the complete refusal to fake a smile 
behind a mask may do more harm 
than good.

The physical act of smiling releases 

neuropeptides that trigger the brain’s 
“happy chemicals”: serotonin, dopa-
mine and endorphins, all of which are 
seldom triggered in a solitary lifestyle 
in a cold climate. Smiling, even if oth-
ers cannot see it, may greatly improve 
our daily mood in the gloomy winters.

Masks allow me to hide from the 

things I find myself needing the most: 
the smiles, the small talk, the whis-
pers in a quiet classroom. As we all 
continue to mask up for public health, 
I hope that we find time to talk to 
strangers, flirt with our eyes and 
smile for the sake of smiling.

Another semester hiding behind a mask

Music Talks: ‘Partita for Eight Voices’ by Caroline Shaw

“Music Talks” is a series where 

Daily Music Writers give their takes 
on the biggest releases in new music. 
From picking best and worst tracks 
to asking what makes a record tick, 
the Music beat is here to give praise 

and give shit to music worth talking 
about.

These quotes have been edited and 

condensed for clarity and brevity.

At 30 years old, Caroline Shaw won 

a Pulitzer for her work, “Partita for 
Eight Voices,” and is still the young-
est person ever to have won that pres-
tigious award. She’s got degrees from 
Princeton and Yale, and she’s worked 

with everyone from Kanye West to 
Ben Folds. “Partita for Eight Voices” 
is a four-movement work written for 
Roomful of Teeth, an ensemble that 
Shaw is part of.

Jason Zhang, Daily Arts Writ-

er: Welcome to “Music Talks” for 
Caroline Shaw’s “Partita for Eight 
Voices.” So I guess the first question 
I wanted to ask was, what were your 

initial thoughts? Just — what did 
you think of the piece?

Kai Bartol, Music Beat Editor: 

Initially, I guess initially, what I 
was thinking is that it sounded very 
mechanical or, digital. Of course, 
the strange vocal stuff was pretty 
unique to the performance. I was 
also very curious as to how that was 
written and composed to sound 

very artificial in that way. 

Ryan Brace, Daily Arts Writer: 

Yeah, to build off that, I remember 
the elements of going from speech 
to sung word — it happens a decent 
amount during the piece. And it’s 
interesting how it’s coordinated 
from being what seems like rhyth-
mic speech, right into, seamlessly, 
some sort of a part harmony. 

Drew Gadbois, Daily Arts 

Writer: I kind of viewed it almost 
as moments of consonance and 
moments of dissonance, in terms of 
like: sometimes it’s very discreetly 
rhythmic, and other times it gets 
really arrhythmic in terms of the 
voices drifting off. And the same 
thing goes for the melody: it’s very 
distinctly melodic, and then it just 
shifts microtonally. 

Bella Greenbacher, Daily Arts 

Writer: It was interesting that it 
was talking about shapes and direc-
tions, in the last movement and 
the first. And then it also seemed 
like dancing directions in the first 
one: I go to this dance camp every 
summer, and we know the dance 
“Allemande,” which is what it was 
called, the title of the song. And it 
was interesting that the music was 
very different from the music that 
we traditionally dance to with that 
dance move.

Conor Durkin, Daily Arts 

Writer: What was so impressive 
was its ability to replicate tonal 
ranges of classical music, where at 
times you forget you are listening 
to an entirely vocal piece. It’s able 
to imitate instrumental sounds 
and expressive ranges of an entire 
orchestra.

 

Arts Editor: I think whenever 
things involve that kind of spoken 
word, especially when it’s spoken 
word that flows into song, the writ-
er in me thinks very much about 
both what is being said and the 
shape, and feeling and sound of the 
words being said. And I think this 
piece definitely used content, word 
shape and sound very interestingly 
as part of the music.

Kaitlyn Fox, Daily Arts Writ-

er: I thought it was cool how there 
is a common thread between all the 
movements. Just thinking back on 
it, the third one was probably my 
favorite. It felt really haunting but 
also a lot different than the first 
one. I think Kai was saying it was 

very mechanical; I thought it could 
be interpreted as like, panting like 
you’re running, which I thought 
was really interesting. Because in 
that movement, it just gave me the 
running-through-the woods type 
vibe.

Zhang: Were there any par-

ticular moments that stuck out to 
you, specifically, and like a specific 
movement or anything?

Brace: One of the parts that 

stuck out to me, I think it was at the 
beginning of the third song, it’s the 
part with all the heavy moaning and 
grunting and panting. I’m assum-
ing that that is meant to signify 
something intimate or sexual, and 
it reminded me of stuff I’ve heard in 
hip hop before. Like, it reminded me 
of a Kendrick song or a Kanye song 

I’ve heard, and it was really interest-
ing how a genre that’s not even close 
to that definitely had influence.

Jack Moeser, Daily Arts Writ-

er: I think a moment that stuck out 
to me, it was the very end and all the 
voices came back and there was spo-
ken word, because up till that point, 
I was kind of mesmerized and I’d 
forgotten these were voices. And 
hearing the cacophony of spoken 
words was kind of a reminder that 
they were voices. 

Bartol: Yeah, there’s also a 

moment, I can’t remember which 
song it was. But it was where all 
eight voices were talking at once 
— and they were all talking about 
math things. And I was thinking 
about just the insane precision, just 
like a mathematical equation that 
went in to sync up all these dispa-
rate sentences together and create 
this really precise cacophony.

Gadbois: 
Yeah, 
I 
definitely 

noticed that too. And I think it’s 
almost, there’s almost like an algo-
rithmic sort of aspect to the piece 
itself, because, even in the words, 
if you focus entirely on the words, 
they’re always in reference to some-
thing that’s going on within the 
piece, either in an abstract sense or 
in a very literal sense.

Zhang: What do you think stayed 

the same throughout all of it? And 
what do you think between the dif-
ferent movements changed? What 
kind of different moods did you get 
from the different movements or 
the piece as a whole?

Chapter 1: ‘Meet Abby’
It seems dramatic to say, “When 

I was six, I happened upon a book 
in a library, and that’s why, 16 years 
later, I am where and what and who 
I am.” That’s just a completely insane 
statement.

It also happens to be the truth.
By the time I turned six, my mother 

had learned that the best way to deal 
with me was to put a book in my 
hands. And so, on an unremarkable 
winter afternoon, not unlike the day 
I’m writing this, she brought me on 
our regular excursion to the library. I 
picked up a copy of “Meet Felicity,” the 
book that is responsible for who I am 
now, 16 years later.

The book told the story of Felicity, 

a young girl growing up around the 
time of the American Revolution. 
Immediately, I was hooked. I quickly 
devoured “Meet Felicity” and all 
the subsequent books in the Felicity 
series, as well as anything I could get 
my hands on about the Revolution. 
I dragged my exhausted parents to 
every relevant historical site in the 
greater Boston area (and there are 
many relevant historical sites in the 
greater Boston area). I even dressed 
up as a colonial girl for Halloween that 

year. I was well and truly obsessed 
(evidence pictured on the right).

Now, a mere 16 years later, I’m no 

less enamored with learning about 
history. I enjoy reading history books 
roughly the size and weight of bricks; I 
binge-watch war documentary series 
on Netflix; I’m about to graduate 
from the University of Michigan 
with a degree in history. All because I 
stumbled upon that one book.

Chapter 2: ‘Abby Learns A Lesson’
The “Felicity” series was one 

of several six-book series that the 
American Girl brand had authored, 
centering their stories on young girls 
(typically between eight and ten years 
old) at different points throughout 
American history. While the books 
highlighted typical children’s book 
narratives — love, friendship and 
kindness — they also illustrated the 
changes in history each girl would 
have lived through at the time.

They followed a pattern with 

which I soon became familiar: 
“Meet Felicity,” “Felicity Learns A 
Lesson,” “Felicity’s Surprise,” “Happy 
Birthday, Felicity,” “Felicity Saves the 
Day” and “Changes for Felicity.” Over 
that six-book arc, each American 
Girl (with her name inserted in the 
title) navigated her own journeys and 
learned her own lessons. In these 
seemingly-kiddish stories, history is 

not just the contextual background. It 
is a central part of the story. 

Accompanying the book series, 

American Girl fashioned a doll of 
each historical character along with 
her various clothes, accessories, pets, 
toys and other accoutrements — all of 
which are sold separately. Naturally, 
I desperately wanted a Felicity doll 
so I could engage with her books’ 
Revolutionary War scenery that had 
gotten me so excited about history. At 
the time, the doll cost 87 dollars. And 
so I started saving. 

My one-dollar weekly allowance, 

Tooth Fairy and present money went 
straight into my piggy bank. Months 
went by, but I held firm: Felicity, I 
reminded myself, would be worth the 
wait. 

I still remember the pure, delighted 

pride and self-satisfaction I got when 
the doll arrived on my doorstep 
shortly before my seventh birthday. 
I had done this — I had earned it for 
myself — and it had been so, so worth 
the wait. 

American Girl dolls and all the 

accompanying toys and accessories 
are not cheap: A doll currently retails 
for $110; outfits, pets, toys for the doll 
and doll housewares are typically in 
the $20–$50 range; doll furniture can 
be upward of $100. I wasn’t the only 
one saving up: With the arrival of their 
holiday catalog each year, girls all over 
the country just like me were pouring 
their allowances toward the brand’s 
robust offering of sparkly products. 

It was a near-universal part of how 

people experienced the brand — at 
one point, American Girl even created 
an activity to encourage girls to save 
up to buy their dream doll. The hyper-

commercialization of the doll brand is 
also prevalent throughout the books: 
The main characters often want a 
doll, dress and/or other toys which 
are deemed “special”; their eventual 
receiving of it later becomes a central 
development within the plot. 

Promoting 
a 
culture 
of 

consumption is a central part of the 
brand, as Allison Horrocks, a public 
historian with the National Parks 
Service and American Girls podcast 
co-host, explains. 

“Most people … have a story of 

remembering 
about 
saving 
up,” 

Horrocks said. “There’s, I think, a 
difficulty with this, that a lot of it is 
driven by consumption: You want the 

things, you want the stuff.”

The price of their products may 

reflect the historical research invested 
into each doll; multiple historians are 
consulted in the process of writing 
each doll’s stories and designing her 
various clothes and accoutrements. 
But it’s worth considering who 
has access to these toys and the 
historical lessons they offer. Teaching 
young children about history, and 
teaching young girls about women’s 
experiences throughout history, is a 
noble goal. And yet, it’s a goal tainted 
by financial inaccessibility.

Chapter 3: ‘Abby’s Surprise’
In addition to financial barriers, 

diversity 
and 
inclusion 
were 

regrettably, if unsurprisingly, foreign 
issues to my and many others’ 
elementary-school minds. So when 
American Girl released a new 
historical doll, Rebecca Rubin, I was 
intrigued. Rebecca, after all, came 
from the same background that I do: 
She was a young Jewish girl, born in 
America and living on the East Coast; 
her family had immigrated to the 
United States shortly after the turn of 
the twentieth century. American Girl 
had finally released a doll that was just 
like me. 

When reading her book series, I 

remember admiring the glossy brown 
waves of her hair, so similar to mine in 
color. I compared her smart burgundy 
dress to my own, decidedly less stylish 
synagogue outfits. 

The series followed the familiar 

six-book progression, with one key 
change. The third book in the series, 
typically called “Felicity’s Surprise,” 
would be a Christmas story. But 
Rebecca’s third book, “Candlelight for 

Rebecca,” was instead a Hanukkah 
story. After years of consuming 
seasonal Christmas content without 
much of a second thought, I didn’t 
realize how much I’d been craving 
seeing my own traditions represented 
in the same venues as those of my 
Christian friends. The introduction 
of Rebecca catapulted these stories of 
Jewish culture into the mainstream, 
Deborah Dash Moore, professor of 
history and Judaic studies, told me 
over Zoom.

“Certainly, the Rebecca doll is a 

new way of (telling stories about young 
Jewish-American girls in history),” 
she said. “I do think it’s a really great 
means to teach.”

Reflecting on Rebecca now, though, 

I have concerns that didn’t occur to 
me when I was nine. I worry that 
Rebecca, a middle-class Ashkenazi 
Jewish girl living in New York who 
dreams of being an actress, skates 
close to long-standing antisemitic 
stereotypes. 
Rebecca’s 
attention-

seeking, 
sometimes-envious 

behavior and “dramatic flair” could 
cause her to be seen as a ‘Jewish-
American Princess.’ Her “knack for 
business and making money” could 
play into long-held canards about 
Jews as the scheming, miserly 
manipulators of the world’s money 
and economy. 

The full story, along with an 

additional interview with Stephan 
Brumberg, historian and Professor 
Emeritus at Brooklyn College, is

Reckoning with 
classism at the 
University

My local coffee shop, Goody’s 

Juice and Java, was where I 
mastered the art of so-called 
“unskilled” labor, or work that 
doesn’t require formal education. 
I had spent the previous summer 
working in a restaurant where I 
became an expert in enduring long 
shifts and angry customers. I’d 
serve every order with a smile, even 
as my feet ached and hot plates 
burned my hands. But, I had never 
quite gotten the hang of working 
through an intense rush hour 
without getting overwhelmed, or 
of balancing cleaning and food 
preparation 
with 
completing 

orders. 

In some cafés, baristas go 

through an intensive training and 
certification process. That wasn’t 
the case for my employer. Whatever 
I needed to know, my boss figured 
I’d be able to pick up on the job. 
At the beginning of my tenure 
there, I couldn’t tell a latte from a 
cappuccino — I was basically only 
good for washing dishes. But when 
I left, I could make drinks, clean 
the entire café top to bottom and 
please even the most demanding 
customers. I wasn’t a certified 
barista and I hadn’t earned that 
much money, but at the end of 
the summer, I knew infinitely 
more 
about 
hard 
work 
and 

professionalism than I had before. 

The café was just one role in a 

long string of gigs I worked 
during high school 
and 
the 

summer 

after my freshman year of college. 
First: a server’s assistant at a 
trendy local restaurant. It was 
popular with tourists visiting my 
sleepy hometown from cities such 
as Chicago and Detroit and had 
a gentrifier-industrial-chic look: 
exposed brick, metal bar stools 
painted bright yellow, hanging 
pendant lights and Americana-
inspired decor. 

Roles 
were 
loosely 
defined 

there: 
Sometimes 
I 
played 

hostess, sometimes I made salads, 
sometimes I cleared tables and 
washed dishes. That had been my 
first job; I was 15 when I started. 
Afterward, there was a brief stint 
as a receptionist at a marina. 
And finally, after completing my 
lifeguard certification, I spent two 
summers working at a community 
pool and tutoring on the side. 

In high school, I wasn’t working 

because I wanted money to go out 
with my friends. I didn’t see it as 
a résumé-building experience. I 
was working because I knew my 
parents couldn’t support me after 
I turned 18. I wanted to attend 
college, but at the time, there was 
no guarantee that I’d go on to earn 
a degree. 

My 
experience 
working 
in 

high school felt distinct from 
most of my college classmates’. 
If they had spent a summer as a 
waitress or a lawn-mower, it was 
often because they were “paying 
their dues.” The job was just an 
intermediate, strictly temporary 

phase in a life that 

had set them up to becoming 
a 
management 
consultant 
or 

financial analyst. There was no 
question that they would, in time, 
move up to the ranks of “skilled 
labor.” 

Now, I like to tell stories of 

my “past lives” to my college 
classmates, especially if I know 
they haven’t worked a low-wage 
job before. There were certain tells 
revealing that someone hadn’t, 
the most obvious being how they 
treated low-wage workers. But a 
trained eye can see other signs, 
too. If you don’t stack your plates, 
I know. If you complain about tip 
jars at coffee shops, I know. (An 
aside: It’s common knowledge 
that servers can be paid below 
minimum wage because they make 
tips, but if you see a tip jar at a coffee 
shop or boba place, there’s a decent 
chance their employer classifies 
them as a “tipped employee” and 
pays below minimum wage).

With my friends, I’d reenact 

memorable 
exchanges 
with 

customers or recall the grossest 
bathrooms I had cleaned. Reactions 
were mixed. Sometimes my peers 
were disgusted, sometimes they 
were sympathetic and sometimes 
they’d laugh along with me. While 
I had certainly exaggerated the less 
savory details of my jobs, I never 
felt ashamed for having worked 
them. I never felt like my 
labor was “unskilled” 
or 
unimportant: 

Every job I 
had 
in 

high school proved quite the 
contrary. 

***

With a tightening labor market 

and 
record-high 
numbers 
of 

workers quitting their jobs in the 
service industry, low-wage workers 
have 
received 
unprecedented 

attention from policymakers and 
the 
white-collared 
executives 

who take them for granted. 
Simultaneously dubbed “essential” 
and “unskilled,” the message to 
these workers is clear: Society 
needs your labor to function, but 
won’t give you the dignity or pay 
that you deserve.

Just days after his inauguration 

in early January, New York City 
Mayor 
Eric 
Adams 
sparked 

controversy 
when 
he 
urged 

downtown offices to reopen. In 
what appeared to be an attempt to 
highlight the interconnectedness 
of the city’s economy, Adams said, 
“my low-skilled workers, my cooks, 
my dishwashers, my messenger, 
my shoe shine people, those that 
work in Dunkin’ Donuts, they don’t 
have the academic skills to sit in the 
corner office. They need this.”

Adams later said he meant to 

say “low-wage” instead of “low-
skilled,” but his correction only 
emphasized the logical fallacy 
in his original statement. Adams 
seems to suppose that wage and 
“skill” are dependent on ability, 

rather 
than 
deeper 

issues of access and an 
inequitable job market.

In this line 
of 
thinking 

that 
his 

comments 
represent, 
the 
Wall 

Street 
employee 
making 
six 
figures 

in a corner 

office is there 

because they’ve earned it, they’ve 
studied hard and capitalized on 
their natural talents. The janitor 
cleaning their office just isn’t cut 
out for white-collar work. 

I had a series of internships and 

other 
professional 
experiences 

in college but still felt like my 
financial situation was precarious. 
It wasn’t until November of 2021, 
when I accepted an internship offer 
working in data science and product 
growth at Facebook, that I realized 
my days of working low-wage jobs 
and worrying about money were 
behind me. Since the summer after 
my freshman year, I’ve made the 
jump from an “unskilled” worker to 
a cushy, well-compensated tech job. 
I had a sense I was underpaid and 
undervalued as a high schooler, but 
I had grown up in a post-industrial 
town as part of a working-class 
family. Working in poor conditions 
and for low wages was simply the 
norm. 

Now, people I don’t know 

message me on LinkedIn to ask 
about my internship. When I was 
home for the holidays, my parents 
repeatedly prompted me to “tell 
them where you’re working next 
summer” when in the company of 
others. The male classmates who 
spoke over me in class treat me 
differently once they find out I have 
a FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, 
Apple, 
Netflix 
and 
Google) 

internship.

Upon entering the corporate 

world, I’ve struggled to reconcile 
the long hours and low pay at 
my first jobs with the status and 
privilege that my education has 
afforded me. How did my degree 
catapult me into the white-collar 
world? My low-wage jobs had 
taught me invaluable lessons, but 
would my corporate colleagues 
recognize 
their 
value? 
What 

knowledge and expertise does the 
term “unskilled” obscure? 

I spoke with Adam Stevenson, 

a lecturer in the University’s 
Economics Department, to try 
to understand the relationship 
between education and “unskilled 
labor.” He expressed frustration 
that the term had been co-opted 
from academia, noting that its 
precise definition is often lost in 
translation. 

“One problem with economics 

is that we use a lot of words that 
are conveyed in plain language 
and used all the time, but when 
we use them in our models, they’re 
being used in a very particular 
way,” Stevenson said.. “When an 
economist in a practice of modeling 
says ‘unskilled,’ they mean that the 
requirement of entry into that job 
involves a low degree of education ... 

Do I think that these jobs don’t take 
practice, that they don’t involve 
dignity, that they don’t involve an 
incredible amount of learning? No.” 

Stevenson acknowledged the 

problematic 
implications 
that 

come with labeling something as 
“unskilled.” 

“It’s hard to separate that sort 

of moral judgment of the word,” 
Stevenson said. “It certainly does 
lack in public relations versus 
what it’s actually meant to convey, 
which is that even though those 
jobs are really important, essential 
jobs and even though they can 
take impressive feats of skill and 
endurance and knowledge, they 
still pay less.”

As 
Stevenson’s 
comment 

suggests, the terms “unskilled” and 
“low wage” work are often used 
interchangeably. And while the 
formal definition of “unskilled” 
labor makes no reference to 
wages, it was telling that they 
were used together. “Low-wage” 
and “unskilled” don’t have to be 
synonymous, but for all intents and 
purposes, they are.

Adams’s comments and other 

takes on “unskilled” labor seem to 
reflect this misunderstanding of 
how the term is technically defined. 
Still, the buzzword has taken on a 
life of its own. The term “unskilled 
labor” — both in academic and 
colloquial uses — purposefully 
obscures 
the 
knowledge 
and 

expertise that goes into these roles. 

Engineering junior Peter Wu 

started working when he was 11. 
First, he worked at a restaurant 
owned by his relatives, and then in 
the restaurant his parents opened 
after they moved to Michigan. 
There, he dabbled in all aspects of 
the business. Wu cleared tables, 
cooked food, filed taxes, managed 
business operations and delivered 
orders on his bike before he could 
drive. 

“From 11 to 18, I’ve been working 

in a restaurant with my parents or 
somebody else’s place. I didn’t ask 
for any wage, because at the time 
I thought learning these skills are 
good and beneficial,” Wu said. 

But it was about more than just 

building skills. Wu and his family 
put in long hours at the restaurant 
because “for us, every penny 
counted. And every penny still 
counts. We needed this to make a 
living.”

Sitting solo at IKEA

Over a year ago, in early 

November, I rode my bike to the 
IKEA Furniture Showroom in 
Canton, Michigan. I left around 
mid-morning and arrived at my 
destination around noon. After 
biking through the two lane roads 
and suburban grids that connected 
me 
with 
the 
blue-and-yellow 

behemoth, I locked my bike onto the 
pole of a road sign and walked inside. 
I rode up the escalator and touched 
my hand to the first ottoman in my 
field of vision, sitting on it as if it was 
in my own home.

I did have reason to act so 

comfortably in this particular IKEA; 
I have been to the Canton location 
at least once a year since my family 
moved to Michigan when I was five. 
And before that, we were frequent 
visitors at the showroom near the 
airport in Newark, New Jersey. As 
my mom helped me and my younger 
brother dip toddler-sized bites of 
the store cafe’s Swedish meatballs 
into 
warm 

gravy, we 

watched planes take off and land 
on the adjacent runways. We 
studied people lifting up their new 
flat-packed KALLAX shelves and 
placing them in the trunks of their 
cars. 

The multi-dimensional liveliness 

of an IKEA store beckons hundreds 
of families just like ours, making a 
day trip out of buying a nightstand. 
Multiply this by hundreds of 
locations around the world — 
millions of people, eating meatballs 
dipped in gravy, carrying out flat 
boxes of disassembled shelves, 
putting them into the backs of their 
automobiles.

I’ve found that the people who 

go to IKEA do so in groups: clusters 
of friends, nuclear families, a father 
with his daughter, a mom with her 
college student. Almost everyone 
who ventures up the escalator into 
the furniture-filled showroom is 
connected to someone else. Their 
networks’ invisible strings are made 
apparent through distant hand 
gestures and eye contact or the call 
of a first name. They might watch a 
close friend sit down on a couch and 
then stand up from it, as if making 
sure they are completing the action 
correctly.

When I go to IKEA with my 

family, we maintain a 
similar 
network. 
My 

parents, armed with the 
all-caps European item 

names 

on tiny slips of paper, scribble notes 
with the store’s complimentary tiny 
pencils. Sometimes, my mother 
carries a clipboard with a black 
and white printout of the item we 
are seeking. My brother and I take 
on the role of furniture-hungry 
explorers, hunting for geometric 
shower curtains, drawing attention 
to a couch that is better than the 
one we have at home, opening the 
sliding doors to a model wardrobe, 
admiring extendable hangers and 
shelf lighting that illuminate our 
eyes to the possibilities of home 
organizing. In a section modeled 
after an urban condo, we pull 
straps and levers on couches that 
miraculously turn them into queen-
sized beds and fold and unfold the 
miniature dining table that allowed 
this fake apartment to squeeze three 
rooms into one. 

When our demonstrations of the 

latest novelties in armchair design 
became too obsessive, our parents 
moved onto media storage and 
office desks, their invisible strings 
pulling us along with them. We were 
the enthusiasts, my parents were the 
practicalists. 

As my brother and I got older, and 

visits to IKEA became more routine, 
our roles while wandering the 
labyrinth of home goods morphed 
into a new standard. Our parents 
became more practical, zipping 
through the showroom to identify a 
specific item before speed walking 

through Marketplace (the soft 
goods section) and out to checkout. 

My brother, Hector, became 

more efficient as well, often trying 
out only two or three sectional 
couches versus the usual dozen or 
more. When I broke formation and 
inspected the various handles of a 
glossy new kitchen cabinet line, my 
parents hurried me along with the 
justification of futile deadlines, like 
going to an art museum or reuniting 
with our cousins, as if anything 
was more important than the latest 
SEKTION kitchen system in a 
modern grey-green. My family was 
holding me back from becoming an 
expert in all things Scandinavian 
design — as if there is anything more 
culturally relevant in Southeast 
Michigan.

Imagine then, the freedom of 

wind rustling through my hair, 
the sun rising in the east, the tires 
of my bike whirring along the 
asphalt shoulder, passing by golf 
courses and farms, gas stations and 
subdivisions — a solo trek to interior 
design’s Scandinavian star. Released 
from the practicality of my parents 
and the unjust shortchanging of a 
time-honored family tradition, I 
promised myself a day to thoroughly 
indulge in all the trappings of IKEA 
Canton.

After touching my hand to that 

initial ottoman and searching the 
rest of the model living room for 
signs of intelligent design, I found 
myself in the sofa area of the store, 
hoping to start my solo showroom 
ride on a comfortable note. I bent 
my legs and let my back fall into the 
basic neutrals of a KLIPPAN sofa, 
mentally preparing notes on its 
firmness level, armrest height and 
vertical support. 

After completing this analysis, I 

looked around the room, realizing 
I had no one to report back to. With 
the critical discussion of reconciling 
couch leisure differences absent 
among a party of one, I moved on 
to the next one, and the next one; 
the motion of sitting on cushions 
quickly becoming mechanical and 
burdensome. I forced myself to try 
out the elegant SÖDERHAMN, and 

the homey HÄRLANDA, knowing 
that I had spent an entire morning 
biking in search of this very luxury. 

When I became too scared of 

embarrassment to test any more 
loveseats, I kept my hands busy in 
the kitchen section by opening and 
closing drawers, then pretending 
to wash a dish and use the drying 
rack on my new quartz countertop. 
I grazed my hands across the wood 
grain YPPERLIG dining table and 
again rated the comfortability of my 
seat, this time made of molded grey 
plastic. 

I looked around the room trying 

to take in all of the details that my 
parents would normally rush me 
past: the woven wood chandelier, 
the moody blue walls, the shimmer 
of a metallic centerpiece. What was 
most eye-catching, though, were the 
other chairs around me. They were 
empty, and it was in this faux dining 
room where the weight of being 
alone in IKEA set in.

Along the slow snaking path that 

guides through the display area, 
I now moved with a new degree 
of self-consciousness. I kept my 
arms closer to myself, careful to 
not get too close to other shoppers 
to prevent infecting them with my 
awkwardness. I stopped bouncing 
in the POÄNG chair once an elderly 
couple walked by and refrained 
from laying down on the colorful 
floral sheets atop the MALM bed 
frame out of fear of being seen as 
odd, or worse: lonely. 

To be fair, I did see other people 

unaccompanied on their respective 
IKEA visits. A young person, 
perhaps in their twenties, lingered 
around the chaises as I searched 
through the sofas. I glanced at 
them, hoping to affirm I wasn’t 
on my own in my loneliness. Our 
paths occasionally intersected as 
we practiced a similar showroom 
pace, but soon they became lost in 
the majority; the couples and trios 
and conglomerates of six crowded 
my vision.

Part of why I felt increasingly 

uncomfortable wandering alone 
through the Michigan branch of 
this Swedish staple is obvious: 

Everyone else was in groups, loosely 
bound by the laws of eye contact 
and soft shouts across EKBACKEN 
countertops, 
and 
I 
was 
not. 

Looking at one’s solo reflection in 
a LASSBYN mirror is much easier 
when there are others you know off 
stage; an arm’s reach away. 

I felt that I had no good reason 

to be there. I wasn’t getting a 
new bed for my college room or 
designing a kitchen remodel. I was 
just existing on top of the colorful 
rugs, floating among the sectionals 
and grazing handles on cabinets. 
I had come here for a joyride, 
to make family tradition better 
through self-singularity. I felt I had 
not succeeded; the intimidation 
of social space squashing me solo. 
I comforted myself with a pale 
green smoothie and two bars of 
chocolate from IKEA Food before 
heading back to the gloomy world 
that 
characterizes 
post-PÄRUP 

melancholy. 

Since this experience, I have 

been back to IKEA a few times, 
mostly with members of my family. 
It is harder for us all to get together 
now, so I go with my mom to get a 
holiday gift for my brother, or maybe 
when my father needs a cabinet 
replacement 
for 
the 
basement 

bathroom. The tradition is kept alive 
through fragments, as-is.

One year later, though, on another 

warm weekend in November, I 
retraced my tire tracks back to the 
asphalt fields of Canton. I rode up 
the escalator and touched my hand 
to the first ottoman in my field of 
vision, sitting on it to establish my 
presence. I was still aware of my 
outcast status, but the familiarity 
of this feeling softened sharp social 
pains into relatively dull, infrequent 
thoughts. 

The multi-seat KLIPPAN still 

alienated me, but I found solace in 
a yellow STRANDMON armchair; 
its firmness level, armrest height 
and vertical support creating a new, 
comfortable niche for a party of one.

The Name 

Game;

Reclaiming my Korean 
heritage

LILY KWAK

Statement Contributor

I never considered myself to be so 

attached to my Korean identity until 
the moment I was filing my N-400 
application for U.S. citizenship and 
had to return to that remaining 
question: Would you like to legally 
change your name? My gut told me 
‘no’ with a feverish conviction as if 
I were cutting off an umbilical cord 
to the past eighteen years of my life, 
presuming the death of my Korean 
heritage. 

“Minjae” has been my name 

always and forever. How could I 
change it now?

***

Nothing made me more meek 

as a child than when I stood beside 
my mother in public. Walking with 
assertion, her feet spring with each 
step, her short curls toss in the 
air, and her chin is held high — a 
countermeasure against demeaning 
microaggressions: I will not bow my 
head to you. I am not afraid to be 
here! 

My mom’s American name is 

Rena, but she will always tell you it’s 
‘heebeh.’ And in response, the lady 
sitting at the front desk or the store 
clerk or whoever will confuse their 
ears with their eyes and open them 
wider. My mother will sigh with 
impatience and hand me the reins, 
and I will spell out her Korean name: 
Hee Bae. 

After ten years living in America, 

my mom still finds no reason to 
bother learning English, and she is 
content. I think my constant teasing 
over the years about her jumbled 
sentences or her pompous walk 
has bowed her head — she now 
smiles timidly, laughs politely and 
says “sorry” and “thank you” to an 
indifferent barista. I have softened 
her into the picture of a sweet and 
harmless immigrant. I wish I hadn’t. 

Maybe I hoped to bend my mother 

into roles which I imagined could 
seamlessly weave us into the rest of 
the American fabric. 

At twelve, 

I walked out of 
libraries holding books which 
transformed me into a depressed, 
wealthy private schoolboy by the 
name of Holden Caulfield. Even now, 
I imagine myself with a cigarette in 
hand, classic brown loafers adorning 
my feet and black liner smeared 
across my eyes, just like Margot 
Tenenbaum. 

Lara Jean, a bright and clumsy 

Korean-American girl proclaiming 
her love for a white boy in “To All 
The Boys I’ve Loved Before” does 
not strike a chord in me, despite 
the distant pride I feel in seeing 
an Asian American actor play a 
lead role in a romcom. Watching a 
Korean immigrant family move into 
Arkansas in search of their American 
Dream story in “Minari” feels oddly 
unfamiliar compared to watching 
a Black classical pianist in the Jim 
Crow South in “Green Book.” But 
perhaps those half-baked media 
representations are unsettling, like 
someone has ripped pages out of my 
diary and revealed it for the world to 
see.

I molded my persona not just 

from fictional characters, but real 
life ones, too. In middle school, I 

remember 
imitating 
Instagram 

photos of prepubescent white girls in 
bikinis and craning my neck to peer 
at the logo imprints on shopping bags 
they carried. I scrambled for a vacant 
seat among pale skin, blue eyes and 
yellow locks like it was a mad dash 
for a musical chair. 

When I moved from Arizona and 

settled into a town in New Jersey with 
a dense Asian American population, 
I felt bitter toward the small posse of 
girls who had relocated from Korea, 
whispering secrets in class in their 
mother language and not bothering 
to mix with others. I did not listen 
to K-pop or watch K-dramas even 
as my white peers became obsessive 
BLACKPINK stans. It was my 
own insecurities which told me: 
whiteness is superior. 

I look back at my high school years 

and feel as though a part of my heart 
has to be rotten from hating my own 
people and hating myself for hating 
my own people. 

I feel like a coward thinking about 

how, at the age of eighteen, uttering 
my own name, Minjae, makes my 
stature shrink and the tails of my 
sentences crawl back inside of me. 

The syllables of my 

name search for 

shelter from the 

vulnerability 

of 
being 

spoken in 

front of 

my 

white 
peers 

who might no longer care, or at least 
are old enough to know not to bully 
me anymore. 

***

My brother changed his name 

from Donghyun to David on his 
U.S. citizenship application last 
year. Though his reasons included 
the 
appealing 
opportunity 
to 

step an extra foot into American 
society, he was explicit about the 
inconvenience and discomfort he felt 
having to correct all of the various 
mispronunciations of his name.

Minari actor Youn Yuh-Jung 

dedicated a portion of her Oscar 
speech to highlighting this shared 
experience: “As you know I am from 
Korea, and my name is Yuh-Jung 
Youn, and most European people call 
me Yuh-young, and some of them 
call me Yoo-jung, but tonight you are 
all forgiven.” 

After shedding a name my 

grandma selected, my brother tells 
me that he regrets his decision. In 
part, it’s because changing names 
on multiple legal documents was 
troublesome. But mostly, he feels as 
though he has erased our grandma’s 

careful choosing from 20 years ago, 
and with that, erased his ethnic 
heritage. 

***

For 
Asian 
immigrants, 
the 

practice of anglicizing names began 
as a measure against racism and 
xenophobia when they first came 
to the United States in a major wave 
in the late 1800s. Marian Smith, 

United States Citizenship and 

Immigration 
Services 

historian, 
writes, 

“Any change that 

might 
smooth 

their 
way 
to 

the 
American 

dream was seen 
as a step in the 
right direction.” 
So great was the 

pressure to assimilate 

and survive between 1900 

and 1930 that, “about 86% of 

all boys and 93% of all girls born to 
immigrants had an American name.” 
Now, a century later, it is uncommon 
for third and fourth generation 
immigrants to hold an Asian name 
at all. 

The 
immigrant’s 
assimilation 

into America is regarded with such 
high esteem that, my mom tells me, 
wealthy parents in Korea send their 
preschool children to “American” 
schools where they are required 
to adopt an American name and 
converse only in English. It is with 
pride that wealthy Koreans can 
afford to become “white” and live 
among white people. 

Jay Caspian Kang, author of “The 

Loneliest Americans,” writes: “We 
know, at least subconsciously, that 
the identity politic of the modern, 
assimilated 
Asian 
American 
is 

focused on getting a seat at the 
wealthy 
white 
liberal 
table.” 

Moreover, “We want our children … 
to have the spoils of full whiteness.” 

The advantages of using an 

American name are ever-present: 
A 2016 research study found that 
“whitened” resumes are twice as 
likely to produce job callbacks. 

Some acts are more overt; an 
Asiana Airlines plane crash in 2013 
prompted what KTVU news station 
considered to be a joke, reporting 
incorrect names of four pilots: “Sum 
Ting Wong, Wi Tu Lo, Ho Lee Fuk, 
and Bang Ding Ow.” Michelle Go’s 
death last month was a reminder of 
the collective grief Asian Americans 
have felt in the rise of anti-Asian 
violence since COVID-19.

Yet, as multiculturalism becomes 

more widespread, I am hopeful of 
possibilities of creating an identity, 
and choosing a name, with less 
fear and more intention. Should we 
continue to use American names 
with ethnic names residing in the 
background? Or have we second 
generation immigrants walked too 
far into the second half of “Korean-
American” to now reverse pedal 
back to original intent? How much of 
“Korean” is left in Korean-American? 
And should I reclaim it before it is too 
late?

What I’ve realized for now is that 

I have spent far too long constructing 
an identity built on shame, denial and 
disgust.

Too much have I felt, internalized 

and been molded by the white gaze. I 
have checked off “Asian American” 
on legal documents without so much 
as a second thought, and my Asian 
heritage has only played a role in 
my identity through my visceral 
reactions against it. 

I am ready to embrace my Korean 

heritage with an open mind and an 
open heart — if not for myself, then 
for my parents, who did not have 
the freedom to consider their place 
in America with seriousness. To 
listen to my Korean friend’s K-pop 
song suggestions with an open ear, 
to catch a reflection of myself in 
Korean-American stories and to 
learn to love every part of myself and 
my identity.

Content warning: This article mentions 

sexual assault.

Writer’s Note: To make it abundantly clear, 

in this space, we believe survivors of sexual 
assault, regardless of gender, class, sexual ori-
entation, age and other circumstances used to 
discredit survivors.

Sienna Mae Gomez, an online personal-

ity who first developed a following on Tik-
Tok and currently has 14 million followers, 
has been accused of sexual assault by her 
former friend and fellow Internet personal-
ity Jack Wright. It was heavily suspected 
after Wright’s friend leaked a video in early 
2021, depicting an incapacitated Wright 
being groped by Gomez coupled with a state-
ment from the friend alleging the abuse, but 

Wright had not addressed the allegations of 
the abuse for months directly. (For the sake 
of respecting Wright’s autonomy, I have cho-
sen to exclude incorporating a link to this 
leaked video.) In the past week, it has been 
alleged, through a video posted by Wright, 
that Gomez assaulted Wright over the course 
of four separate incidents — including the 
incident depicted in the leaked video — dur-
ing their relationship. Over the course of the 
17-minute testimony, Wright explains the 
circumstances of his friendship with Gomez, 
which was characterized by Gomez’s manip-
ulation, love bombing, consistent bound-
ary-crossing and many assaults. Wright’s 
incredible strength shows through as he 
gives a detailed account of the events that 
transpired. Survivors of sexual assault should 
not have to give such a detailed account on 
the internet, and they should be believed 
regardless of whether or not they choose to 
disclose the details to the public. Although, it 
is understandable why Wright would choose 
to do so. Other survivors have contacted him, 
alleging that Gomez has assaulted them as 
well. In addition, Gomez previously released 
several videos alleging that the leaked video 
was made to deplatform her, that have since 
been taken down. 

In response to the video, Gomez has gone 

on to deny Wright’s allegations through a 
Medium post. The apology follows the same 
format that celebrity apologies typically do: 
acknowledgment of the allegations, some 
element of establishing it as a supposed he-
said/she-said situation and a promise to do 
better in the future. These apologies usually 
leave the author’s (or in the most likely case 
authors’) true intention uncertain, whether it 
be a true apology or a last Hail Mary attempt 
to protect their platform. As a reader, it is 
difficult to truly know what the writer’s 
intentions are, yet Gomez mentions in the 
beginning of her post that “(her) legal team 
sent his legal team a letter threatening a law-
suit for defaming (her) character because 
that ‘is the best next step to clear your 
name.’” In this case, it is abundantly clear 
that Gomez’s intentions are not to apologize 
and is simply another celebrity’s graceless 
attempt to disavow the pain they’ve caused 
and maintain their platform. 

(From this point in the article, I want to 

make my intentions clear. In no way, shape 
or form do I want to inspire any hate toward 
Gomez. However, a large part of the news 
coverage following these allegations has 
left a sour taste in my mouth as it has large-
ly failed to address the inadequacy of her 
response and the harm it caused.) 

The post then details her version of their 

relationship, which largely resembles the 
timeline brought forward by Wright — with 
a few key differences. Gomez discusses how 
she felt that he had allegedly “disregarded 
(her) feelings for the sake of money” when 
Wright has said he wanted to maintain mys-
tery on the status of their relationship for 
brand deals. (For context, a large amount of 
Gomez’s and Wright’s content at the time 
included featuring one another in romanti-
cally themed videos.) Gomez also stated that 
the aforementioned leaked video was filmed 
months before as a “joke.” Apart from the 
timeline, Gomez minimizes her boundary-
crossing as not harmful, but simply not hav-
ing the same “love language” as Wright. 
Gomez additionally claims, “Consent isn’t 
really something that is formally taught in 
school” as a way of stating that she, at the 
time, allegedly did not understand what 
consent was. While it is true there is a lack of 
formal sex education in the United States, it 

should not act as a defense and doesn’t negate 
her responsibility to take accountability for 
her transgressions. Furthermore, Gomez 
accused Wright of allegedly trying to paint 
her “into the ‘loud’, ‘crazy’, ‘overly sexualized’ 
stereotype that people try to use on young, 
especially Latina, women,” and equates the 
accusations against her to equivalent action 
that Jack took, suggesting “(Wright alleg-
edly) did some stupid stuff too.” In summary, 
the statement is a mess. 

Despite Gomez’s emphasis on her own 

personal growth in the statement, claiming 
“(She) is grateful to have had the opportu-
nity to learn so that (she) can be a better ally 
to victims of sexual assault,” she contradicts 
herself by continuing to paint Wright in a 
negative light. She perverts concepts such 
as “love languages”, lack of sex education, 
sl*t- shaming and the monetary ties of their 
relationship in an audacious attempt to dis-

credit a sexual assault survivor. This delib-
erate misappropriation is heightened by her 
simultaneous acknowledgment that she did 
not respect boundaries, or “love languages,” 
as she put it, throughout the duration of their 
friendship, diminishing the impact of these 
violations. Gomez also attempts to justify 
this misappropriation by including details 
of the monetary aspect of their relationship, 
as content from the relationship was largely 
used to bolster both individuals’ careers 
through paid-for brand deals and even a real-
ity TV show. I cannot imagine how difficult 
it must be to grow up under this much pub-
lic interest and have monetary ties to one’s 
relationships. However, inclusions of these 
details only serve as a way to minimize her 
transgressions against Wright and invite 
further criticism against him. It also seems to 
serve as a way to allegedly justify her actions 
against Wright, which is perhaps the most 
disheartening aspect. 

A lot of news outlets have covered the 

aforementioned 
monetary 
ties 
(brand 

deals, increased viewership, etc.) of their 
relationship and Gomez’s excuses of “love 
languages” that were depicted in Gomez’s 
Medium post.While I understand the need 
for including these details in the coverage, 
I feel it undermines Wright’s experience 
and alleged assault. One in seven boys will 
experience some form of sexual violence by 
age 18. The likelihood of reporting is even 
lower for men, as opposed to the already-low 
reporting rate for women. For the most part, 
the sexual assault of men remains largely 
undiscussed and neglected. Wright’s state-
ment is a brave step forward to inspire others 
to talk about their experiences by opening 
dialogue for others to share their stories. We 
need to create a space where sexual assault 
survivors, regardless of gender, can come 
forward without fearing that every previous 
action they have taken, harmful or not, will 
be hypercriticized and put under scrutiny.

The statement also included the weap-

onization of an experience that I, and a lot of 
women that identify as Latinx, also face and 
understand well, which is the over-sexual-
ization and objectification of Latinx women. 
It’s no surprise that Gomez chose to incorpo-
rate this into her defense, as her platform has 
largely propagated stereotypes of being, in 
her own words, a “spicy latina” for her mon-
etary gain, despite rarely, if ever, speaking on 
issues that have impacted our community. I 
take issue with this, as the over-sexualiza-
tion of Latinx women personally impacts 
me. Throughout the years, I have witnessed 
the overly sexualized portrayals of Latinx 
women in the media and have been at the 
receiving end of disgusting comments as 
well. One incident in high school stands 
out to me the most when I think about the 
impact this over-sexualization has had on 
my life. It was my senior year at Saline High 
School, and we had just received our grades 
back for our quiz in AP Economics. I had 
been assigned to sit at a table where I was 
the only young woman of Color. After receiv-
ing a Starburst for performing well on the 
quiz, I came back to my desk to find a note 
passed to me by the boys at my table. It was 
a stick figure drawing of me in a sombrero 
with a crude gigantic pair of boobs. I can still 
remember the self-satisfied smirks on their 
faces as I opened the note, and the matte, 
speckled grey tiles in the bathroom where 
I cried after class was over. This stereotype 
has had painful implications for my comfort 
and relationship to my identity. 

Content warning: This arti-

cle mentions sexual abuse and 
assault.

Through it all, as students 

trudge across campus, dread-
ing those frigid expanses 
between toasty shops and 
classes and apartments, sur-
vivors of Dr. Robert Ander-
son’s abuse remain perched 
in front of the president’s 
home. 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week, they radically 
proclaim 
their 
existence 

with a strength that I can 
only describe as relentless 
beyond measure. These peo-
ple, whom disgraced former 
University President Mark 
Schlissel once referred to as 
“a group of folks in tents,” 
and the campsite that evinc-
es their message serve as a 
quiet, yet powerful, remind-
er to those walking down 
South 
University 
Avenue 

that accountability for the 
trauma of more than a thou-
sand human beings is yet to 
be had — and that there is 
no true justice for those who 
have been and continue to be 
harmed by sexual assault.

One of those courageous 

protestors is Tad Deluca, 
who, in 1975, wrote a let-
ter to his U-M wrestling 
coach and then-U-M athletic 
director detailing the abuse 
he’d endured at the hands of 
Anderson. As a consequence 
of his brave actions, he was 
kicked off the wrestling team 
and his full-ride, out-of-state 
scholarship was revoked.

This is the story he gra-

ciously shares with me when 
I chance upon him outside 
his campground on Friday; I 
have the honor of being able 
to tell Tad that I’m in awe of 
him and all he’s sacrificed to 
decry those complicit in the 
serial abuse. He graciously 
smiles, saying he can’t tell me 
how much that means to him. 
The feeling is infinitely more 
than mutual. Tad is wear-
ing glasses with skinny wire 
frames and a beanie, and his 
cheeks are raw and red from 
the harsh January wind chill. 
And with the same friendly 
nonchalance 
one 
usually 

reserves for chatting with 
a neighbor, he tells me he’s 
now retired and lives with 
his wife in Grosse Pointe, MI 
— but, of course, he’s put his 
life on hold to protest out-
side the president’s home. He 
warmly remarks that his wife 
is learning how to shovel the 
snow off their driveway in his 
absence, and that she’s proud 
of it too.

Tad also says, somewhat 

apologetically, that he would 
invite me into his tiny trailer, 
but it’s so cramped that one 

has to hunch their shoul-
ders to walk inside; he even 
has to keep his apples and 
oranges in the microwave 
due to the lack of space. The 
right-most tent from the side 
that faces the street houses 
nothing but maize T-shirts, 
emblazoned with the mantra 
“Hail to the Victims” in blue 

letters and stacked high in 
a mass of cardboard boxes. 
(“Hail to the Victims” alludes 
to the U-M mantra “Hail to 
the victors” — forcing the 
U-M community to reckon 
with its systemic abuse by 
juxtaposing it with the Uni-
versity’s culture of school 
pride and spirit.) Tad ducks 
into the tent to replenish the 
stash of shirts on the plastic 
table outside the campground 
that displays a sign reading 
“FREE HAIL TO THE VIC-
TIMS T-SHIRTS.” Next to 
the table is a maize mailbox 
labeled “815 ½ Vaughn.” 

After 
sharing 
his 
own 

Anderson story, Tad then 
tells me about another sur-
vivor who was so scarred by 
Anderson that he refused to 
seek any medical attention 
for decades after his abuse 
physically ended. The survi-
vor, Chuck Christian, is the 
first former U-M football 
player to publicly speak out 
against his abuse by Ander-
son; he told the Detroit Free 
Press in April 2020 that he 
refused to seek proper medi-
cal attention for decades 
because he “associated (doc-
tors) with fear, with pain,” 
despite having suffered from 
symptoms 
of 
serious 
ill-

ness since around 2005. And 
now, Christian is terminally 
ill, with stage four prostate 
cancer. “No matter how sick 
I was, I would never go to 
the doctor,” he said in the 
2020 Free Press interview. 
Decades after his time at the 
University, Christian’s abuse 
has directly, and irreparably, 
cost him his life.

Christian is not the only 

Anderson 
survivor 
whose 

trauma has caused trepida-
tion toward seeking proper 
medical care. According to 
a GoFundMe page update, 
on his 32nd day of protest-
ing outside the president’s 
house, 
Anderson 
survivor 

Jon Vaughn felt a lump in 

his neck. Shannon Henry, his 
friend and fellow survivor of 
sexual assault who had estab-
lished the page, urged Vaughn 
to seek medical attention. 
She writes, “But after being 
sexually assaulted by a doc-
tor, the last person you want 
to see is a doctor.” Eventually 
and thankfully, however, he 
sought medical care and was 
diagnosed: Vaughn had thy-
roid cancer. 

The day Tad talked to me, 

Jan. 21, was the day that 
Vaughn underwent surgery 
to remove the nodule in his 
thyroid. Tad says that he 
received a text earlier that 
day at around 2 p.m. inform-
ing him that Vaughn had 
about an hour of surgery left. 
And rather than get the prop-
er rest he needs at home or in 
the hospital, Vaughn, in his 
tireless commitment to hold-
ing the University account-
able for its long history of 
covering for sexual abusers, 
wanted to return to his camp-
site the next day. A GoFund-
Me page update penned on 
the day of the surgery by 
Larry Nassar survivor Trinea 
Gonczar says, “Most know 
us as these freedom fighter 
radicals that have been on the 
front lines of survival. But 
today, this, is different. Life is 
precious. I’m reminded.”

Back at the campground, 

signs rooted in snow articu-
late slogans like “Hail to the 
Victims,” and “Students + 
Survivors Equally STAND.” 
One 
simply 
inscribed 
in 

blue Sharpie catches my eye: 
“Mark — I AM STILL HERE 
-Jon.” Under it, someone has 

replied hauntingly in red 
marker: “(and you won’t be!).” 
As students of this University 
— which has actively worked 
to protect predators, time and 
time again — we have a moral 
obligation to stand with all 
survivors of sexual assault on 
this campus, like Vaughn, in 
support and solidarity. When 

I ask Tad what someone like 
me can do to help his cause, 
he tells me he would appreci-
ate receiving hand warmers 
such as those from HotHands 
which can be found at the 
Target on State Street. But, 
Tad says, the most important 
asset that students can give to 
the survivors is our support, 
through actions like wear-
ing a “Hail to the Victims” 
T-shirt, attending the future 
rallies that Tad says the sur-
vivors are currently organiz-
ing and spreading awareness 
to denounce and address the 
culture of sexual violence and 
lack of accountability that the 
University has continually 
maintained. Additionally, the 
aforementioned GoFundMe 
effort donates financial sup-
port to Vaughn’s mission “to 
ensure the safety and healing 
of those entrusted to the Uni-
versity of Michigan’s care, 
past, present, and future.” 

Tad says it has been incred-

ible 
to 
witness 
students 

approaching him and sharing 
their stories, confiding in him 
their own encounters with 
sexual abuse. And then I feel 
compelled to tell him some-
thing that not many people in 
my life know, which is that I, 
too, am a survivor of sexual 
assault. 

Tad’s brows immediately 

furrow. “Did this happen 
here?” he asks me, his tone 
somber and urgent. I answer, 
and he looks into my eyes and 
tells me, “I believe you.” It is 
my first time hearing those 
words.

On days when I open my 

eyes to the rays of sunlight 
gleaming through the window 
of my apartment bedroom, I 
get a certain sense of seren-
ity — almost like everything is 
okay. And even if it’s not now, 
it will be okay. The sunlight 
bounces off the mirrors in my 
room, making small rainbows 
in the corners where the walls 
meet the ceiling. It makes the 
hardwood floors seem a lighter 
shade of oak brown and fades 
the scuffs and scratches that 
once marked my bedroom 
walls. It makes the 16th floor 
that I live on no longer seem 
so daunting. On mornings like 
those, I feel happy. 

To me, the sun is no longer an 

objective term — a burning ball 
of fire, the center of our uni-
verse, the source of our light. It 
has become synonymous with 
happiness and a certain sense 
of nostalgia. It reminds me of 
the three-bedroom ranch home 
where I was born and raised for 
half of my life. The home where 
I learned to love chaos, noise 
and laughter. It reminds me of 
my four siblings and I piling 
up to sleep in one room despite 
the plentiful amount of space 

for all of us around the house. 
It reminds me of the trampo-
line in our backyard and the 
days when the sun made it 
warm enough for us to jump 
on it until nightfall. The tram-
poline that I slowly watched 
lost springs and nails and nets 
and eventually, its guests over 
the years. It reminds me of 
afternoons spent with my two 
older sisters; one with a flat 
iron in her hand straightening 
her bleach blonde highlighted 
hair and the other at the van-
ity in our shared room pressing 
blue glitter eyeshadow all over 
her eyelids. As Britney Spears 
played in the background off 
the sticker-adorned hot pink 
stereo, I would watch from the 
corner in awe. The sun shined 
so brightly in that home — it 
made me feel safe, it made me 
feel light and it made every-
thing feel euphoric.

And my love for the sun is 

what fuels my hatred for win-
ter. Winters have always been 
the harshest time of the year 
for me — especially Michigan 
winters. One would expect that 
I would be used to the bitter 
cold of the winter months by 
now. After all, these winters 
are the only winters I know. 
But watching my days get 
shorter and shorter, feeling my 
nose sting the moment I step 

outside and hearing the birds 
slowly stop chirping never gets 
easier, no matter how many 
times I’ve lived it. The sun 
stops showing her face as much 
this time of year. And runny 
noses, gloves and jackets have 
just never managed to become 
my forte. I only trudge through 
the winters so that I can make 
it to the time of the year when 
everything is reborn. When the 
sun comes back out and gives 
myself and the world around 
me life again. When the grass 
turns green and the flowers 
bloom and everything begins 
to sparkle. 

But me and the sun’s love is 

complicated. 

And the sun can be cruel. 
I remember the first time I 

fell asleep in the sun. For days 
after, I watched as my olive 
skin reddened and blistered. 
It stung and shriveled up and 
eventually peeled off. 

How could something I love 

so much be so bad to me?

It was sunny when I fell and 

broke my wrist in the second 
grade. It was sunny when I got 
rejected from my dream uni-
versity in high school. It was 
sunny when I experienced my 
first heartbreak. It was sunny 
as I walked home with tears 
in my eyes convinced I failed 
my accounting exam (for the 

record, I didn’t). It was sunny 
every single time I received 
news of the loss of a loved one.

It was loss that forced me to 

see the sun in a new light — a 
much bleaker light. I watched 
the sunrays bounce off the 
walls of my bedroom that 
once brought me so much love 
through sobs and teary eyes. I 
watched those same sunrays 
bounce off tombstones at the 
cemetery. The irony.

So sometimes I question how 

I can love the sun. On one hand, 
I love the sun because she rep-
resents everything good. But 
the sun has not always been 
good to me. And that makes 
me a living testament to the 
fact that we love the things that 
sometimes hurt us the most. 

I often wonder what that 

says about me. As humans, 
our love is intrinsic. Our love 
has no barriers and sometimes 
happens without us realiz-
ing it. And that’s exactly what 
happened with the Sun and I. 
When we love, we allow (and 
some may even say force) our-
selves to put down a wall and 
accept vulnerability. It’s scary, 
but in turn, we sometimes let 
that love blind us from seeing 
the bad. 

But that’s just the thing 

about the sun — sometimes it 
burns you. 

Not just TikTok drama: We 

need to reassess how we 
talk about sexual assault

I

f you’re like me, you’ll agree 
that winter semester did not 
begin Jan. 5, at least not in 

spirit. With both students and 
professors adjusting to hybrid and 
in-person classes as well as spend-
ing a majority of the first two lec-
tures going over syllabi and basic 
course structure, the semester 
started off slow. When did things 
really begin? Jan. 18, the day after 
the Martin Luther King Jr. long 
weekend. My start was similarly 
sluggish. For instance, I decid-
ed to spend that long weekend 
rewatching my favorite TV show 
from 2021, “Ted Lasso.” During 
my two-day long binge, I came 
across what is probably one of my 
favorite quotes ever:

“You just listen to your gut, okay? 

And on your way down to your gut, 
check in with your heart. Between 
those two things, they’ll let you know 
what’s what.”

For as long as I can remember, be 

it the biggest Bollywood stars from 
back home, the cream of the Holly-
wood crop, or the most awe-inspiring 
storybook heroes, all of their portray-
als had one trait in common: brav-
ery. From Hermione and Frodo to 
Jack Traven from “Speed,” I idolized 
characters who were able to defy the 
odds and do what they thought was 
right, even when everyone was tell-
ing them not to. I looked up to them 
because they had the uncanny ability 
to, time and again, do as Ted Lasso so 
eloquently said: trust their guts and 

follow their hearts. As I grew older, 
however, and was confronted by the 
prospect of making life-changing 
decisions, I realized that it is easier 
said than done. Case in point: my 
decision to attend the University of 
Michigan. 

With this year’s early action deci-

sions right around the corner, I can’t 
help but be reminded about how 
stressful April 2020 was for me. 
With the Indian government send-
ing everybody into a total lockdown 
on March 23 following the outbreak 
of COVID-19, I decided to try and 
make the best of my circumstances. 
I resolved to finalize which college I 
would be attending and made quick 
and early progress by narrowing 
down to two choices at the begin-
ning of the month. Thirty days later, 
after multiple spreadsheets with 
rubrics that considered everything 
from weather to alumni network and 
phone calls with every distant cousin 
that had any connection to either uni-
versity, I had made no progress. Yes, 
it was frustrating, but a part of me 
saw it coming, because I knew inde-
cisiveness ran in my family. It wasn’t 
the first time I had second guessed 
myself, and it wasn’t the first time I 
had lacked conviction. Feeling lost 
and disappointed, I remember calling 
my best friend and telling her about 
my dilemma. All she had to say was, 

“ 
After a point you have to stop 

making lists and just go with your 
gut.” 

The next day I paid my deposit for 

the University of Michigan and have 
not looked back since. 

To all those currently contemplat-

ing their next steps in life, be it your 

college decision, asking someone out 
to the homecoming dance or pick-
ing between two ice cream flavors at 
Ben and Jerry’s, I only have one thing 
to say: have faith in yourself. Lists, 
rubrics and spreadsheets are good 
and I will always affirm that the solu-
tions to many of our problems can be 
found through simple and logical 
reasoning. In truth, deciding which 
criteria I was going to consider for my 
university rubric and what weight I 
would assign to them gave me a clear 
idea of what I wanted from my college 
experience and helped me immense-
ly. Nevertheless, once I realized that, 
even after a month, I was no closer 
to knowing where I would be in Fall 
2020, I learned that even reason has 
its limitations. Only intuition could 
fill the gap. 

I am hardly an expert, but when-

ever I’ve found myself stuck without 
any apparent rational next step, I did 
what I felt was right. That, I think, 
makes all the difference in the world. 
It doesn’t always work. In fact, it 
blew up in my face on a couple of 
occasions. After all, even Frodo, the 
usually unshakeable hero, hesitated 
at the end of the “Lord of the Rings” 
movie and was consequently subject 
to some bodily harm. But there is no 
better way to prove to yourself that 
you are in control of your life than 
to follow your instincts, because 
they’re one of the only things that 
are 100% you. They are the purest, 
most organic choices that you can 
make, and as Ted Lasso so brilliantly 
recalled, 

“It is our choices that make us who 

we truly are, far more than our abili-
ties.”

F

or more than 150 years, DTE 
Energy has generated energy 
for the state of Michigan, and 

now serves 3.5 million customers. 
DTE Energy, a private company, 
supplies energy to the people of Ann 
Arbor as well as the University of 
Michigan. However, recently DTE 
has been leaving their customers 
“in the dark,” with over 158,000 
customers left without power in 
August 2021. Michigan is the fourth-
worst state in the United States when 
it comes to average time to restore 
power to a customer after an outage. 
These paying customers are tired 
of this monopoly company with a 
lack of reliability and clean energy 
generation. While DTE has made 
promises to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, there is no competition 
holding them accountable. DTE has 
promised to reach net zero carbon 
emissions by 2050, but this will 
also increase rates for customers 
by $3.18 per month. Michigan also 
performs below average compared 
to the rest of the United States when 
it comes to reliability, affordability 
and environmental impacts. Due to 
these issues, many have proposed 
a 
municipalization 
of 
energy 

production in Ann Arbor to create a 
community-owned utility. 

Municipalization is the transfer 

of all the assets of a privately owned 
company to a public institution. One 
of the most pivotal benefits of such 
a change would be reliability. Such 
a switch to public ownership might 
lead to quicker response time during 
emergencies as the utility is in local 
hands. Furthermore, publicly owned 
institutions are not profit driven, 
their central focus is instead on 
catering to the citizens of Ann Arbor 
by making the utility more affordable. 
Public power also involves citizens in 
the decision making process, which 
would represent a significant step 
towards helping the people of Ann 
Arbor reach their goal of clean power 
— one that they have been crying out 
for. A switch to public power might 

also prompt long-term thinking 
regarding more sustainable forms of 
generating energy; this is something 
a private firm — under pressure to 
deliver short-term profits and keep 
shareholders happy — might not find 
the time and resources to do.

In light of this push, as well as the 

issues with DTE that precipitated it, 
the Ann Arbor City Council voted 
on Jan. 18 to begin a study into 
the effectiveness and feasibility of 
a municipal electricity program. 
Although 
the 
aforementioned 

benefits of public power would 
seem to suggest that such a study 
would simply be a delay — if public 
power is such an unalloyed good 
and so necessary to fight climate 
change, we should be willing to 
spend large sums of money on it — 
there is not a consensus on whether 
or not it would actually be the 
right thing to do. While DTE has 
unsurprisingly come out against 
the proposal, opposition, or at least 
apprehensiveness, is not limited to 
those with a direct interest in seeing 
the project fail. The City Council 
resolution to create this study had 
been debated since last September, 
with some members pushing for a 
more extensive survey given their 
concerns.

Why 
do 
some 
people 
still 

doubt the proposal? The truth is, 
municipalization is hard, with the 
last 
successful 
municipalization 

project in Michigan dating back 
to 1912. Creating a public utility is 
an extensive, difficult process that 
requires support and commitment 
from the community. Not all 
municipalities are successful, for 
reasons ranging from political 
battles to a lack of momentum 
required to complete such a long 
and arduous process. In the case of 
Ann Arbor, there is also the issue 
of having to buy out DTE’s existing 
infrastructure, 
an 
expensive 

purchase, considering the breadth 
of infrastructure and investment 
present, that will be an early 
and significant roadblock if the 
municipalization were to go ahead. 

But Ann Arbor is different. The 

large public university that lies 

within it can facilitate the steps that 
need to be taken. Someone must 
“spearhead” the development of this 
utility by promoting the concept to 
the community, discussing with 
the local government and handling 
legal aspects, and the University 
of Michigan is an institution large 
enough to do so if they wished. Not 
only does the University have a 
considerable influence on the Ann 
Arbor community, they are also the 
largest consumers of power in the 
city, which would make any public 
backing of the municipalization 
on their end a game-changer. 
Over and above providing some 
much-needed resources for the 
process, they might also be able to 
play a key role in helping build the 
aforementioned sustainable power 
system. There is precedent for such 
a concept. A glance at East Lansing 
yields a prime example — Michigan 
State University’s T.B. Simon Power 
Plant. Moreover, the University of 
Michigan has already shown signs 
that it is willing to move away from 
carbon-based energy sources.In 
2019, the U-M campus consumed 
a total of 6,924,524 MMbtu, which 
was primarily generated through 
cogenerated steam and natural 
gas combustion. The University 
has switched a portion of its own 
energy usage away from DTE into 
its own production because of the 
unsustainable practices of DTE. 
Supporting a transition away from 
purchasing DTE Energy would 
illustrate to the public that the 
University views sustainability as a 
priority to combat climate change. 
In the past, the University has been 
unable to take a larger step due 
to lack of funding and incentives, 
but a partnership between Ann 
Arbor citizens and the University 
could prevent this. The University 
is a consistent and organized 
presence in the city, as opposed to 
the student body, which undergoes 
massive turnover every four years. 
They should take an active role in 
energy production and distribution 
in Ann Arbor, as that is key to the 
environmental goals it claims to 
back.

Trust your heart; it knows the way

N

o 
one 
likes 
to 
feel 

abandoned. 
This 
is 

especially true as the 

dead 
of 
winter 
approaches, 

with seasonal affective disorder 
and the current omicron surge 
combining to leave many people 
feeling increasingly isolated and 
lonely. Jan 2., or Dating Sunday, 
an unofficial holiday that sees the 
busiest activity across multiple 
dating app platforms, falls right in 
the middle of this. The explanation 
for the intense surge in dating 
app usage at this time is that the 
day falls right after holiday blues, 
when people have set New Year’s 
resolutions and are counting 
down the days until Valentine’s 
Day. This also coincides with the 
end of cuffing season, another 
impetus of online dating activity. 

Amid all of this, digital daters 

need to remember the basics of 
dating etiquette. This means to 
communicate with honesty and 
clarity with potential matches. 
Above all, commit to not ghosting 
someone if you have decided to no 
longer pursue them romantically. 
Even if you may have found 
another person or want to avoid 
the awkwardness of breaking it 
off, ghosting is something that 
should be avoided out of respect 
for the other person’s time and 
emotions.

Ghosting, while a newly-coined 

term, has been a mainstay of the 
dating scene for decades. Tropes 
of people escaping a date by 
crawling out a bathroom window 
or disappearing without warning 
are well established. The act has 
worryingly become normalized. 
Fifty percent of people in the 
dating scene have been ghosted 
and almost the same amount 
have been the one to ghost. This 
behavior once was reserved for 
the 
disrespectful. 
Nowadays, 

ghosting is common practice. 
This is alarming. What does it say 
about current dating culture when 
abrupt abandonment of one’s date 
is accepted practice? Ghosting 

is now one of those things that 
comes along with finding a 
romantic partner.

There needs to be a recalibration 

of dating culture. It’s not healthy 
for sudden loss of contact to be the 
status quo. 

Ghosting may seem innocuous. 

However, 
it 
has 
serious 

consequences for the ghosted. 
Ghosting hurts because it’s a 
whiplash 
in 
assumptions 
of 

how a person feels about you. 
To the ghosted, someone, who 
they thought cared for them, 
abandoned them. A person who 
they were building trust with 
all of a sudden disengaging from 
contact can feel like nothing 
short of betrayal. Being on the 
receiving end of ghosting can 
be painful. Studies have shown 
that social rejection activates 
the same neurological pathways 
as physical pain. Ghosting can 
trigger the grief cycle as the 
ghosted experiences an emotional 
concoction 
of 
embarrassment, 

anger, sadness and loneliness. 
While ghosting may be an easy 
way out of the relationship for 
the ghoster, it can be immensely 
hurtful to the ghosted. 

Taking the courage to break 

off contact by sending a simple 
“I’ve decided to take a break on 
meeting new people” text does 
the potential ghoster good as well. 
It promotes character growth. 
Admitting that you no longer 
want to connect with someone 
means you are being honest 
with yourself and strengthening 
your communication skills and 
empathy. By not ghosting, it is a 
clear signal that you understand 
how your actions affect others. 
You’re acknowledging that you at 
least care enough about the person 
to not want to hurt their feelings 
more than just spurring a tad of 
disappointment. 

Yes, ghosting is the easy way out. 

In theory, all bad feelings can be 
avoided by ignoring the situation 
all together. It’s not unreasonable 
to feel guilty for wasting the 
time of the other person now 
that the match is going nowhere. 
But you’re not a bad person for 

honestly 
communicating 
your 

feelings to others. A bad person, 
though, would ghost and leave the 
other person hurt and confused. 
By giving the other person some 
sort of closure, it can help them 
process their feelings and move 
on to other people. Not ghosting 
indicates your respect for the 
other person, and it is a moment of 
character growth that will benefit 
you in future romantic ventures.

I have been in both positions. 

Unfortunately, I ghosted someone 
in my past. Looking back on it, 
now also having inhabited the 
position of the ghosted, I am not 
proud of ghosting someone. It 
might have alleviated my shame or 
nervousness, but thinking of how 
my actions may have negatively 
affected the person I was talking 
with does not feel great. I now 
realize that it is better to have 
the courage to respectfully end 
communication with a potential 
romantic 
interest 
by 
clearly 

voicing your thoughts and feelings 
rather than running away from 
the situation all together. Being 
ghosted is not a great thing to go 
through, and therefore, I’ve made 
a pledge to never ghost someone 
across a dating app again.

It’s rude to abruptly walk out 

of an in-person date with no 
warning, so why would it be any 
different over text? Netiquette 
must be maintained when we 
connect with each other across 
dating apps. This is for the 
benefit of both parties. Direct 
communication will always be 
superior to ghosting. Though 
it can be uneasy to break off 
connection 
with 
someone 

through text, it is better than 
the fallout that accompanies 
ghosting. Ghosting can cause 
the ghosted to feel lonely, hurt 
and confused. I, for one, would 
not want the fact that I caused 
someone to feel that way on my 
conscience. Vowing to not ghost 
future romantic interests forces 
one to be honest with oneself 
and to not hurt others through 
abandonment. 
Let’s 
make 

ghosting uncool again. It never 
was cool in the first place.

Let’s stop ghosting each other

O

n September 23, 2021, the 
University of Michigan 
hosted the English band 

Glass Animals for a concert. The 
indie rock band, which has existed 
since 2010, combines synth-pop, 
indie, R&B and hip hop. While 
they have seen minor successes as a 
band in the last decade, nothing has 
taken mainstream media by storm 
quite like their song “Heat Waves.” 
“Heat 
Waves” 
was 
originally 

released in June 2020, and it 
subsequently experienced a slow 
rise to mainstream popularity. This 
slow rise was so slow that the song 
broke the record for the longest 
ascent to the top on Billboard’s Hot 
Rock and Alternative Songs.

The popularity built up as “Heat 

Waves” played in the second season 
of Netflix’s popular original series, 
“Never Have I Ever,” during the kiss 
between the two main characters, 
and from this a TikTok trend was 
born. The trend was TikTokers 
putting videos of important figures 
in their life to the song. The original 
sound by sevier.edits has been used 
in over 1.4 million videos, and the 
original version of the song has 
526.5k uses. Many U-M students 
who attended the concert did not 
know much about Glass Animals 
other than this singular viral song. 

Despite lasting over two hours, 

the entirety of the concert set, 
hosted at Crisler Center, was filled 
with the entire audience chanting 
“PLAY ‘HEAT WAVES,” ignoring 
the other songs. Once the song 
played, few people sang other than 
the 30 seconds featured on social 
media and the Netflix series. Once 
“Heat Waves” ended, droves of 
people left. Most people didn’t care 
about the concert outside of what 
was seen as “viral.” It led me to 
question: why didn’t they bother 
to look into this band further? 
Everyone 
knew 
they 
would 

be attending the band’s entire 
performance, so why did no one 
listen to any other songs or even the 
entirety of “Heat Waves”? Did they 
lose the capacity to listen to the 
Glass Animals with all the other 
digital media they consume?

Media involves constant, rapid 

information 
being 
exchanged. 

There is always an opportunity 
to discover something new. In 
2021, we took in five times more 

information than we did in 1986. So 
how does this constant exposure to 
new information and media impact 
how we function? According to 
Microsoft’s Attention Span Research 
Report, what was an average human 
attention span of 12 seconds in the 
year 2000 dropped to eight seconds 
by 2013. In comparison, the average 
attention span of a goldfish is nine 
seconds. This decrease in attention 
span relates to everything from 
concentrating 
in 
conversations 

to focusing on schoolwork to 
engaging with content. This is due 
to the information overload of social 
media, which 73% of Americans 
report feeling. Specifically, with 
regard to the music industry, there 
are an overwhelming number of 
artists, genres, albums and songs 
that are now accessible with the 
touch of a button. With so many 
competing interests, it’s impossible 
to absorb every artist fully. 

Yet, living among a digital 

landscape, we are becoming better 
at being more alert and efficient 
with the shorter bursts of attention. 
These changes in our consumption 
explain today’s concept of “going 
viral.” The media obsesses over 
a specific trend, song or public 
figure, which they then promptly 
forget. 
Everyone 
is 
constantly 

craving something new. This is 
called novelty seeking, or a “strong 
interest in having new experiences.” 
Musicians Institute explains that 
the ability to debut songs through 
posting makes it easier to discover 
artists by eliminating the necessity 
of a label. However, there is an 
increased amount of content by 
increasing accessibility, which is 
why these viral songs often don’t 
stick. 

The extensive process of “getting 

the song out there” that many 
musicians experienced in the past 
doesn’t exist in the same capacity 
today, making these viral songs pop 
up right in front of us. On a silver 
platter, new content appeals to our 
new attention patterns. We either like 
or scroll, causing the content to pop up 
on more devices or not. There’s always 
an audience on the internet waiting 
for that next best thing. According 
to the Pew Research Center, 31% of 
American adults are online almost 
constantly and 48% go online several 
times a day. Overall, more than eight 
in 10 adults go online at least daily. 
Considering this study included adults 
from ages 18 to 64, our reliance on 

technology knows no age limits.

Before the widespread use of online 

music platforms, we mainly absorbed 
concept albums used by artists to 
produce a narrative for the listener. 
When all the songs are listened to 
together in the full album, there’s a 
storytelling experience that cannot 
be replicated. For this reason, album 
connoisseurs instruct us to sit down 
and take in the whole experience. But 
this is not a reality that today’s society 
often partakes in. Today’s lifestyle 
rarely allows us to listen for the 
meaning in music; we’ve introduced 
habits that put the soundtrack on 
the back burner. There is often a 
secondary task such as walking to 
class, getting ready or doing work. 

The quick development of social 

media is changing the way audiences, 
especially 
younger 
generations, 

consume 
digital 
and 
physical 

products. Producers must adapt to 
these preference changes to develop 
more accurate consumption models. 
There will be no advancement of 
music if we continue producing for 
the past – we need to appeal to the 
future. So, should there be a switch 
in the music industry to cater to this? 
If a two-minute song is completely 
ignored, with the exception of the 
15-second section that goes viral on 
social media, why are we still focusing 
on producing longer content? Should 
the music industry shift to create 
shorter content presenting a message 
or emotion more efficiently? Or 
continue the way we always have? 
Should we adapt or hold onto these 
traditions of the past? 

Music has been a mode of 

movement for centuries, a strong 
force of social development tackling 
issues such as racial injustice or 
gender roles. So focusing on the 
best way to intertwine this medium 
into our lives to benefit consumers 
emotionally, socially and politically 
is a key concept to analyze. Whether 
it is creating another industry solely 
focused on this shorter content 
production or releasing shorter 
versions of soundtracks for those 
who want to lightly listen, this 
shift in consumption habits must 
be recognized to keep music as a 
relevant medium for all types of 
listeners. There is still a significant 
industry for the kinds of listeners 
album creators desire, so by 
manufacturing a separate industry 
just for this “viral” content, the 
music for trends and deep listeners 
can be separate.

What music can tell us about our attention span

L

ast summer, when 
President Joe Biden 
proclaimed to Amer-

icans that we were “closer 
than ever to declaring our 
independence” from COVID-
19, it seemed unfathomable 
the nation would find itself in 
the throes of yet another pan-
demic surge just six months 
later. Yet, here we are again. 
Even with over 500 million 
vaccines administered across 
the country — and over 70% 
of Americans age 12 and older 
fully vaccinated — COVID-19 
has once again upended daily 
life. By some measures, 2022 
feels eerily like 2020 all over 
again.

The current surge is fueled 

by 
the 
highly-contagious 

omicron variant of COVID-
19, which has spread through 
the nation at unprecedented 
speeds and sent case counts to 
dizzying heights. On Jan. 10, 
health officials reported 1.48 
million new cases, more in a 
single day than at any other 
point in the pandemic, shat-
tering the previous record 
set just days before. With the 
explosion in cases has come 
a spike in hospitalizations, 
pushing 
many 
healthcare 

facilities, doctors and nurses 
to the brink. In Michigan, 
hospitals across the state are 
near or at capacity as pan-
demic hospitalizations break 
records.

In the midst of all this, some 

governments are responding 
with the harsh tactics we’ve 
all become familiar with over 
the past two years. In Canada 
and Europe, which face simi-
lar surges, governments have 
instituted a slew of measures 
including lockdowns and clo-
sures of schools and busi-
nesses to combat the spread. 
Though it may seem at first 
glance that current conditions 
warrant a similar move by 
President Biden and governors 
across the country, it’s criti-
cal we update our COVID-19 
game plan and avoid the same 
traps we’ve fallen into before.

As alarming as the lat-

est pandemic metrics are, 
they have to be put into per-
spective. First and foremost, 
experts believe the omicron 
variant — which now accounts 
for over 98% of new COVID-19 
cases in the country — is less 
severe than previous strains 
like delta. A new study found 
patients who contracted omi-
cron were 53% less likely to 
require hospitalization and 
over 90% less likely to die 
than those who suffered from 
the delta variant. As in earli-
er waves, Americans who are 
fully vaccinated continue to 
have a good prognosis. While 
omicron 
has 
evaded 
some 

of the vaccine’s protection 
against symptomatic infec-

tion, the vaccines are still 
extremely protective against 
severe disease. A booster shot, 
which more Americans are 
receiving every day, bolsters 
protection further. Following 
Canada and Europe’s lead and 
shutting down schools, col-
leges and businesses as cases 
surge simply isn’t supported 
by the data.

Returning to harsher con-

tainment measures wouldn’t 
only be unwise because omi-
cron is a milder variant relative 
to earlier strains of COVID-19. 
Omicron is also wildly trans-
missible, even more so than 
the 
highly-infectious 
delta 

variant. In the early days of 
the pandemic, closing down 
large sectors of the country 
proved to be an effective tool 
in slowing the spread. But 
today, with omicron skyrock-
eting in almost every county 
across the nation, preventing 
every individual case is no 
longer possible or practical.

“Omicron, with its extraor-

dinary, unprecedented degree 
of efficiency of transmissibil-
ity, will ultimately find just 
about everybody,” Dr. Antho-
ny Fauci said, noting the vac-
cinated and boosted who do 
get infected will “do reason-
ably well in the sense of not 
having 
hospitalization 
and 

death.” 
Though 
lockdowns 

may reduce cases in the short 
term, they won’t stop the 
virus from spreading over 
the long run. It’s imperative 
that American leaders, from 
the local to the federal level, 
prioritize preventing severe 
disease over cases, which are 
almost always mild for the 
vaccinated and even some-
times asymptomatic. 

Already, 
President 
Biden 

has turned his focus toward 
preventing 
hospitalization 

and death, reassuring most 
Americans 
that 
it’s 
“very 

unlikely that you become seri-
ously ill.” The Biden admin-
istration recently took action 
to support hospitals and pro-
mote vaccines and testing to 
keep the country running. 
Many state leaders have taken 
similar actions, acknowledg-
ing that COVID-19 lockdowns 
and closures are no longer 
prudent. Gov. Jared Polis, 
D-Colo., has refrained from 
imposing stringent measures 
and said “Getting three doses 
of the vaccine is highly effec-
tive and all but negates any 
risk that you face.”

Despite the sound argu-

ments against locking down to 
slow the omicron surge, some 
segments of American soci-
ety have temporarily back-
pedaled into the pre-vaccine 
era. Perhaps most notably, 
Chicago 
Public 
Schools 
— 

which serves nearly 350,000 
students — closed down for 
a four-day period over the 
rapid rise in cases. Chicago 
students have since returned 
to school, though the closure 

proved to be a massive dis-
ruption to both students and 
parents 
who 
have 
already 

suffered enough. Students in 
Atlanta, Baltimore, Milwau-
kee and elsewhere have faced 
similar disruptions to in-per-
son learning, though staffing 
shortages have necessitated 
some of the closures.

College campuses across the 

country have also shuttered to 
start the new year in response 
to omicron. Nearby, Michigan 
State University moved class-
es online until Jan. 31, joining 
a lengthy list of institutions 
nationwide that have pivoted 
to remote learning. Schools 
like 
Yale 
University 
have 

taken it a step further, telling 
students to refrain from din-
ing in off-campus restaurants, 
even outside.

Closing down schools, col-

leges and businesses is not the 
way to navigate the omicron 
surge. There is no reason to 
believe short-term lockdowns 
will do anything significant 
to curb the spread of a virus 
that is hyper-transmissible. 
After two years spent fight-
ing COVID-19, we have the 
tools to address the pandemic 
while keeping society running 
as normal as possible. Vac-
cines are readily available to 
any American who has yet to 
get the shot, while an array of 
high-quality masks like N95s 
are much easier to obtain than 
earlier in the pandemic. For 
people who do come down 
with COVID-19, there are 
more promising treatments 
and therapeutics all the time, 
including a new Pfizer pill 
aimed at keeping patients out 
of the hospital. 

Another powerful tool we 

have at our disposal is test-
ing. While finding COVID-
19 testing has proven to be a 
struggle at times, the Biden 
administration has ordered 
one billion at-home tests to be 
delivered to make it easier for 
Americans to protect them-
selves and others. Widespread 
testing provides a real-time 
picture of where COVID-19 
is most active, ensuring the 
infected can quarantine and 
schools or businesses with 
high case counts can tempo-
rarily shut down to reduce the 
spread.

The University of Michi-

gan’s plan to hold in-person 
classes rather than shifting 
to remote learning demon-
strates that with mitigation 
measures, there’s no reason 
why omicron should reverse 
the months of progress we’ve 
made. While it’s critical we 
remain vigilant until the cur-
rent wave subsides, Americans 
who have done everything 
right for the past two years 
cannot endure another second 
out of school or work. We have 
what it takes to find a way out 
of this pandemic without slid-
ing backward.

T

he past several days 
have been a trying time 
for Ann Arbor. With the 

dire knish shortage and hours-
long Pizza House wait times, 
students have been forced to 
subsist on overpriced calzones. 
Even worse, as University of 
Michigan students unravel the 
vast conspiracy against them, 
they have been driven into 
pangs of loneliness, finding 
solace 
only 
in 
clandestine 

private briefings.

All jokes aside, this moment 

is an inflection point for the 
University of Michigan. As 
the dust settles at the end of 
a 
disgraced 
administration, 

it’s high time we take stock of 
where our values have strayed 
as a university and determine 
what our objectives must be 
going forward. Our choice of 
a new president will guide 
the direction of the school for 
many years to come, so it’s 
paramount that we not only 
identify a strong leader but also 
— in the process — reassert our 
commitment to the University’s 
core values.

The first and most important 

area of improvement for the 
University is reviving a student-
centric leadership approach. 
To restore trust after the 
multitude of recent scandals, 
the administration must take 
the time to truly listen to the 
student population and address 
their needs. After two years 
of an inconsistent pandemic 
response, many students yearn 
for the administration to make 
meaningful 
strides 
towards 

fully reopening and lifting all 
COVID-19 requirements. 

While 
the 
administration 

boldly decided to keep the 
University open during the 
fall of 2020, betting that high 
caseloads wouldn’t translate 
to 
hospitalizations, 
the 

decisiveness of their response 
has noticeably tapered. Four 
semesters into the pandemic, 
while the University now has 
a 98% vaccination rate, testing 
is not always readily available 
and 
quarantine 
housing 
is 

abysmal. Luckily, the school 
has the monetary resources 
necessary to make rapid testing 
universal, which would allow 
the University to move towards 
lifting pandemic restrictions. 
A new administration needs 
to 
capitalize 
on 
existing 

infrastructure to bring the 
University back to the forefront 
of the fight against COVID-19.

Another key area for the new 

administration to focus on is 
reestablishing 
the 
school’s 

commitment to inclusiveness 
and equality of opportunity. 
Throughout former University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

tenure, he sought to make 
the University more inclusive 
by making cultural identity 
a central tenet of campus 
discourse, requiring diversity 
training 
for 
students 
and 

expanding the administration’s 
role in shaping campus culture. 
Unfortunately, this plan to 
foster 
inclusiveness 
was 

misguided in its execution, 
failed to make major strides 
towards a truly diverse campus 
culture and at times trivialized 
real issues under the guise of 
revamped 
rhetoric. 
Despite 

the University’s $85 million 
investment 
in 
a 
diversity, 

equity and inclusion plan from 
2016 to 2021, the headline 
achievements of the spending 

were rather modest, including 
an annual review of faculty DEI 
plans and funding to support 
future DEI research. 

“Equity” is an incredibly 

complex 
concept 
and 
is 

not something that can be 
accomplished through brute 
force. Though the University 
boasts 
the 
largest 
DEI 

department of any American 
university, with more than 150 
staff, a large bureaucracy does 
little to shape a diverse campus 
culture. If we truly want to 
move 
towards 
inclusivity, 

we must shift the campus 
conversation from segmenting 
individuals 
to 
treating 

everyone equally, regardless of 
race or class. 

At a progressive school such 

as the University of Michigan, 
racial tension is far more 
commonly found in a lack of 
interaction between cultures 
than 
overt 
racism. 
While 

diversity training may teach 
students to practice antiracism 
through their actions, studying 
racial theory often has little 
practical 
application 
in 

bridging divides. In fact, the 
forced 
nature 
of 
diversity 

training can often cause it to 
backfire, 
teaching 
students 

to identify races as separate 
entities rather than a single 
component of the identities of 
otherwise similar individuals. 
By taking a more hands-off 
approach to DEI, the University 
has the opportunity to make 
far greater strides towards 
inclusivity, capitalizing on the 
tolerance of the student body 
to foster conversations about 
our similarities rather than our 
differences.

LILA TURNER/Daily 

Graduate student Nick Suriano set the tone for Michigan against Minnesota with a dominant victory.

Energetic 

performances lead 
to Michigan’s upset 

against No. 3 Nebraska

Michigan overcomes early deficit, takes down Minnesota

Jack Glanville: Michigan has nothing left to prove

As redshirt sophomore Cameron 

Amine had his hand raised follow-
ing a 6-1 decision victory, it felt like 
Crisler Center let out a collective 
sigh of relief. 

Amine’s assertive win stopped 

the bleeding for No. 4 Michigan 
(7-1 overall, 3-1 Big Ten), as it had 
lost three bouts in a row going into 
the intermission. The Wolverines 
went on to win four of the next five 
bouts and defeat No. 16 Minnesota 
(3-4, 2-3). 

“That second set of five is a great 

group of guys,” Michigan Coach 
Sean Bormet said. “Five All-Amer-
icans, five leaders, five guys that 
have a great work ethic and want 
to compete hard. Those were domi-
nant wins.”

No. 1 graduate student Nick 

Suriano started the meet off with a 
dominant victory over No. 9 Patrick 
McKee, earning a 14-6 major deci-
sion after a signature high-energy 
performance. 

Redshirt 
freshman 
Dylan 

Ragusin followed that up with a 6-5 
win at 133 pounds to put the Wol-
verines up 7-0.

Then things got messy.
Graduate student Stevan Micic 

suffered a 5-2 upset at 141 pounds 
despite nearly pinning No. 15 Jake 
Bergeland in the third period. Then 
at 149 pounds, Michigan redshirt 
sophomore Pat Nolan was out-mus-
cled by No. 25 Michael Blockhus. 
Nolan was able to avoid getting 
pinned but ended up losing 14-5 in 
a major decision, and Blockhus tied 
the meet up at 7-7. 

The Wolverines showed some 

life in the last match before the 
intermission, which featured No. 14 
redshirt junior Will Lewan versus 
No. 4 Brayton Lee. Lewan brought 
some energy back to the Michigan 
bench with an athletic takedown 
to close the first period but was 
unable to assert any control in the 
final two, losing 5-4.

The loss put the Wolverines 

down 10-7 going into the break. 
When they re-emerged from the 
locker room, there was a clear focus 
on re-asserting control.

“We looked to dominate the 

match,” graduate student Myles 
Amine said. “That’s the big thing 
we tried to do. Our flaw against 
Penn State (on Jan. 10) was that we 
really let them control the center 
and control ties. Your winning per-

centage goes way up when you can 
do those two things.” 

Those coaching points were evi-

dent in the next string of matches. 
The Wolverines took three deci-
sions, as well as one major decision 
from Amine in a dominant techni-
cal performance over Minnesota’s 
Sam Skillings.

Another standout performance 

came from graduate student Logan 
Massa at 174 pounds. Massa brought 
new life to the crowd from the start 
of the first period, dragging Min-
nesota junior Bailee O’Reilly away 
from the boundary multiple times 
to maintain his dominant position. 
Massa had to overcome a deficit in 
the second and eventually earned 
an unsportsmanlike conduct pen-
alty in the third period, but he over-
came this to win 7-4.

“I think [we] did a great job, after 

giving up initial points, of con-
tinuing to wrestle seven minutes 
and flip the switch,” Amine said. 
“That’s kind of what we’re looking 
for and that’s what we can build off 
of as a team.”

That electric stretch ensured a 

Michigan victory, despite a major 
decision loss in the final match of 
the night at heavyweight. No. 4 
junior Mason Parris was unable to 

overcome No. 1 Gable Steveson, an 
Olympic gold-medal holder, and 
lost 18-8. 

In spite of that loss — as well as 

the three earlier losses — the story 

of the night was the Wolverines’ 
ability to dominate late. Bormet 
acknowledged 
that 
dominance 

after the meet:

“Even those matches where we 

didn’t get bonus points, they were 
dominant victories, and that’s what 
we want. We want to destroy the 
guy in front of us physically and 
mentally.”

On a quiet, unassuming Saturday 

afternoon in Ann Arbor, the Cliff 
Keen Arena was anything but.

The building buzzed from start to 

finish as the No. 5 Michigan men’s 
gymnastics team (8-0 overall, 1-0 Big 
Ten) defeated No. 3 Nebraska (3-3, 
0-1) with a final score of 409.100 – 
400.50. 

Led by junior Paul Juda and gradu-

ate student Nicholas Guy, the Wol-
verines won five events with three 
individual champions, sending Michi-
gan home with an eighth-straight vic-
tory. The score marks a season high for 
the Wolverines in a matchup character-
ized by a team that trusts its own system

“I believe our team is ready for the 

moment.” Michigan interim coach 
Yuan Xiao said.

The Wolverines entered into the 

matchup as underdogs, yet were pre-
pared to face a strong Nebraska team 
that has tumbled to a third-straight loss.

The Cornhuskers looked rocky 

from the outset of the floor rotation. 
Their anchor, Sam Phillips, misland-
ed twice and stepped out of bounds on 
his signature aggressive routine. He 
and the Nebraska team struggled to 
find a rhythm, and left the door open 
for an energized Michigan squad. 

The Wolverines grabbed an impres-

sive first rotation win trademarked by 
anchor Guy’s tightrope landing on a 
double flip to end his floor routine. As 
a fifth year senior, Guy’s presence as 
anchor has not only physical implica-
tions, but mental ones too.

“[Guy] just hitting a routine is 

extremely important for the team,” 
Xiao said. “The seniors set a real model 
for the freshman and sophomores. He 
does silent work, but he’s a leader. We 
love to have him on the team.”

As the second rotation forged 

ahead, Michigan built upon its early 
lead. It secured another 1.350 mar-
gin over the Cornhuskers on pommel 
horse thanks, in part, to junior David 
Willett’s exceptional 13.150 on bars, 
punctuating the routine with a single-
handed dismount into a double flip 
with a half turn. Driving his feet into 
the ground like stakes, the arena filled 

with applause as one Wolverine gym-
nast shouted: “He was so good!”

With an ample 2.800 lead going 

into the third rotation, Michigan 
posted its best score of the day on 
rings, achieving a 70.000 flat — the 
second best rotational score of the 
day. Juda anchored the event for the 
Wolverines, and captured the mood 
of the meet, landing a near perfect 
landing to soaring screams from the 
crowd, and raising his hands as if to 
say: who else?

“I love hearing the crowd roar, 

right? I love hearing my name,” Juda 
said. “I love all of that. But more than 
anything, it’s the guys in front of me 
that are setting that tone, and without 
them, none of it can happen.”

Michigan needed that team men-

tality, though, as Nebraska took the 
fourth rotation on vault, scoring an 
excellent 71.100 — the highest rota-
tion of the day — cutting the Wolver-
ine lead to 5.400 for a running score 
of 273.550-268.150. Conversely, the 
Wolverines struggled heavily on the 
rotation, with two major falls on their 
first two vaults.

However, Michigan found its 

stride once more on the parallel bars, 
and the rest of the meet went its 
way. Despite a strong 14.250 start by 
Nebraska’s Dylan LeClaire, Michigan 
proved to be too much, scoring above 
13.800 on three of their five routines. 

Going into their final rotation with 

only the high bar left, the Cornhusk-
ers trailed 342.300 to 335.950. This 
section would be the Wolverine’s 
strongest as they gained another 
2.400 points on Nebraska, and pushed 
the arena to a fever pitch. On back-
to- back-to-back occasions, the final 
three Michigan high bar competitors 
received a roar of commotion from 
the crowd before even sticking their 
landings, culminating in an average 
individual score of 13.900.

With a chance to respond, the Corn-

huskers fell short, punctuated by two 
heart-stopping slips by Phillips who none-
theless returned to the bar each time.

Instead, feeding off its own energy, 

Michigan prevailed.

“We feed off each other on horse, 

on rings,” Guy said. “We feed off the 
energy of each other.

Entering halftime, the No. 6 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 

team held a slim 32-30 lead over 
No. 5 Indiana. The Wolverines 
went on a 9-0 run to start the 
game, but were outscored by 
seven through the rest of the first 
half. 

The Wolverines put themselves 

in difficult situations, committing 
17 turnovers in the first half. This 
forced them to defend on multiple 
back-to-back possessions.

“We had a stern talk at half-

time. It puts things into perspec-

tive,” senior forward Naz Hillmon 
said.

Added Hillmon: “Coach is very 

demanding. She knows what we 
can bring to the table and knew 
that we weren’t doing that at the 
moment.” 

The Wolverines came into the 

second half with renewed ener-
gy and controlled the tempo in 
the third quarter. This put more 
pressure on grabbing defensive 
rebounds and negating second-
chance points for the opponent. 
They wanted to be more physical 
on the defensive end of the court. 

Senior forward Emily Kiser, 

who returned from a first quarter 
injury in the second, had a career 

night, snagging a season-high 16 
rebounds, 14 of which came off 
the defensive glass. When Indiana 
missed a shot, Kiser would not 
give up the loose ball. With less 
than a minute in the third quar-
ter, Indiana guard Chloe Moore-
McNeil missed a driving layup. 
Kiser grabbed the rebound, nulli-
fying a potential comeback by the 
Hoosiers.

“She’s 
such 
an 
incredible 

defender and such an incredible 
presence next to Naz,” Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico said. 
“She does so many great things 
for a team that doesn’t show up in 
the box score. I was happy for her 
presence back out there because 
she does so many intangible 
things to help our team be suc-
cessful. She’s having a career year 
and she and Naz are playing off of 
each other so incredibly well.”

The Wolverines put on a defen-

sive clinic in the third quarter, 
holding a top-five team to six 
points on 25% shooting. Michigan 
also defensively outrebounded 
Indiana by a 8:1 margin.

“(Barnes 
Arico) 
challenged 

each and every one of us whether 
you thought you’re playing well 
in the first half or not.,” Hill-
mon said. “She stuck it to us and 
wanted us to know that we had 17 
turnovers in the first half and we 
needed to change that in order to 
be successful. I just think it was 

her challenging us to switch to a 
different gear and to make sure 
down the stretch we were doing 
the little things, even if we did end 
up with 25 turnovers, doing some-
thing that can help us overcome 
that a little bit.”

Outside of Hillmon and Kiser, 

the Wolverines were able to get 
defensive help from their 

starting guards. Junior Maddie 

Nolan, senior Leigha Brown and 
senior Danielle Rauch combined 
for 14 defensive rebounds in the 
game.

“I think the biggest thing right 

now is just clicking as a unit on 
defense,” Rauch said. “Individu-
ally, we’re all not the best defend-
ers in the world. But when we’re 
gapping for each other, closing out 
hard and rotating is when we’re at 
our best. We work on that every 
single day and it’s showing now.”

Michigan’s defense continued 

to excel as the game wore on, 
holding Indiana to 14 points in 
the fourth quarter. When the dust 
settled, the Hoosiers’ 50 points 
was their lowest total of the sea-
son.

“Our identity is our defense, 

and our offense will come based 
on how we perform on defense,” 
Rauch said. “Certainly wasn’t 
a perfect game. But we battled 
and we fought and every time we 
stepped on the court, we’re gonna 
leave it all out there.” 

At the beginning of the season, 

I was forced to pick who I thought 
would win the Big Ten. Predic-
tions are hard. I went with the safe 
choice and picked last 
season’s Big Ten champi-
ons, Maryland, to repeat. 

At the time, I thought it 

was a good pick. But now, 
on Jan. 31, it’s become 
apparent that I was very, 
very wrong.

Because the No. 6 

Michigan women’s bas-
ketball team is going to 
win the Big Ten.

“I think for our kids to 

come away and beat a team in our 
league that only has two losses, 
to Stanford and NC State — two 
top five teams — that we’ve lost to 
the last couple times we’ve played 
them,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes Arico said. “I think it’s a 
great moment for us.” 

It’s been a remarkable season 

for Michigan so far. After entering 
the season winless against top-five 
opponents in program history, the 
Wolverines have just secured their 
second in a single season after 
beating Indiana at home, 65-50, on 
Monday.

And the win wasn’t a fluke.
Michigan didn’t have a particu-

larly strong offensive showing — 
turning the ball over 25 times and 
making just one of its 11 three point 
attempts — but still managed to 
defeat the No. 5 team in the coun-
try by a 15-point margin.

The Wolverines have built their 

identity in the paint, playing tough 
defense and crashing the glass. All 
three of these strengths were on 

full display Monday night. 
Michigan 
outrebounded 

Indiana by an absurd mar-
gin of 52 to 20.

The 
most 
impressive 

part, though, is that the 
rebounding wasn’t coming 
from senior forward Naz 
Hillmon, the Wolverines’ 
top rebounder. She account-
ed for just five of Michigan’s 
boards. Whether it was 
senior forward Emily Kiser 

— who finished with a career-high 
16 rebounds — snagging a missed 
shot, or one of the Wolverines’ 
guards flying in to secure the 
rebound, the whole team was con-
tributing on the glass.

The defensive showing was 

equally 
impressive. 
Michigan 
held 
the 

Hoosiers 
to 

a season-low 
50 
points. 

Indiana’s 
top-scorer, 
forward 
Macken-
zie Holmes, 
was 
watch-

ing from the 
bench 
with 

a knee injury, 
but 
holding 

the Hoosiers to just 50 points is 
still an impressive feat.

To further assert their domi-

nance 
inside, 
the 
Wolverines 

poured in 46 points from the paint 
compared to the Hoosiers’ 28.

It was a massacre down low, and 

as a result, Michigan’s ball secu-
rity issues and inefficiencies from 
range didn’t matter. 

The Wolverines trampled Indi-

ana.

That’s what great teams do. 

They find ways to win, even if 
things aren’t going their way, even 
if the situation doesn’t play to their 
strengths. And it’s what Michigan 
has done all season.

Against Baylor, the Wolver-

ines shot 4-for-14 from three and 
turned the ball over 16 times. 
Throughout their thrashing of 
Maryland, they turned the ball 
over 19 times. And in Columbus, 

Michigan shot 5-for-16 from three 
and turned the ball over 17 times. 
The Wolverines won every single 
one of those games. 

They scored more paint points 

and outrebounded each of those 
teams en route to what have 
become this season’s signature 
victories.

Michigan is a great team, and 

on Monday night, it proved it to the 
entire nation.

“Indiana was kind of the stan-

dard,” 
senior 
guard 
Danielle 

Rauch said. “They were at the top 
of the Big Ten and undefeated. 
We knew that coming in, and we 
knew that we were going to have 
to prove to everybody that we are 
the best team right now.”

It’s safe to say that they did.
The Wolverines don’t have an 

elite offense. They shoot a fairly 
average 46.1% from the field and 
32.3% from 3-point range. Michi-
gan more than makes up for it with 
a dominant interior presence, elite 
rebounding and strong defense.

The creation of a strong iden-

tity revolving around the Wolver-
ines’ authority down low has made 
their mediocre scoring efficiency 
irrelevant. Michigan has played 
to its strengths and consistently 
beaten great teams. In the process, 
they’ve asserted themselves as one 
of the nations premier programs.

And now, for the first time in 

program history, they’re going to 
win the Big Ten.

The Michigan women’s basketball team knew what 

was on the line:

Its first top-10 win at home, handing Indiana its first 

conference loss, and most importantly, taking control of 
the Big Ten.

In their biggest game of the season, the sixth-ranked 

Wolverines (19-2 overall, 10-1 Big Ten) battled against the 
fifth-ranked Hoosiers (14-3, 6-1) in a game that was close 
until late in the fourth quarter. The Wolverines came out 
on top, winning 65-50.

Under two minutes into the game, Michigan 

swaggered back to the bench with smiling faces. Indiana 
had just called its first timeout of the game to try and stem 
the bleeding after a 9-0 opening run from the Wolverines.

The Hoosiers looked stunned, struggling to get into a 

rhythm. Senior forward Naz Hillmon dominated early 
in the paint, and senior forward Emily Kiser crashed 
the boards to secure seven rebounds in the first quarter 
alone. 

Then the Hoosiers found their footing.
Dropping into a full-court press, Indiana exploited 

the Wolverines’ biggest weakness — sloppy turnovers. 
Committing 10 in the first quarter alone and 25 on the 
night, turnovers throughout the game gave the Hoosiers 
ample chances to keep Michigan’s lead in check. 

“We had a stern talking to at halftime,” Hillmon said. 

“It’s been a while since we had one of those but it put 
things into perspective. … she wanted us to know that 
we had 17 turnovers in the first half and that we needed 
to change that in order to be successful.”

Under two minutes into the second quarter, Indiana 

drained a 3-pointer from the wing, tying the game for 
the first time all night. Clawing their way back into the 
fight, the Hoosiers refused to allow the Wolverines’ lead 
to grow. Indiana outscored Michigan 16-13 in the second, 
and the Wolverines entered the locker room clinging to a 
two-point lead.

Starting the second half with back-to-back offensive 

putbacks from freshman guard Laila Phelia and senior 
guard Amy Dilk, the Wolverines managed to keep the 
Hoosiers at bay. Continuing to capitalize on offensive 
rebounds, Michigan found a way to overcome the plague 
of turnovers that continued to affect them, notching 52 

rebounds, more than double Indiana’s 20. 

“We got the better of them tonight on a day where 

we turned the basketball over a ton in the first half,” 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico said. “We talked a lot 
at halftime about staying disciplined, staying true to us 
and trying to be better in the second half. And you figure 
how do you get to victory when you turn the ball over 
that much but the way we rebounded the ball and the 
way that we defended I thought was exceptional.”

Indiana made it challenging for the Wolverines to get 

the ball to Hillmon in the paint, continuing to thwart 
any momentum the Wolverines could gain. Making it 
challenging to get the ball in the paint to Hillmon, the 
Wolverines struggled to score midway through the 
third quarter. Indiana continued to rein in any sort of 
momentum the Wolverines could gain. 

Then, the seniors got fired up. 
In the final minutes of the third quarter, the 

Wolverines righted the ship. Coming off the media 
timeout, senior guard Danielle Rauch drained a long two 
from the wing. With buckets from Brown and Rauch — 
and Hillmon once again finding success in the paint — 
Michigan capped off the quarter on a 6-0 run, stretching 
the lead to 12 points.

Indiana continued to pester the Wolverines with 

its full-court defense, attempting to force turnovers 
and sloppy passes like they did throughout the first 
half.

Yet, Michigan’s lead proved insurmountable 

throughout the fourth quarter. Hillmon continued 
to steal the show through the fourth, tallying 21 
total points on the night. With Brown relegated to 
the bench with foul trouble for much of the second 
half, the Wolverines continued to go with what 
they knew would work — Hillmon in the paint.

The Wolverines minimized mistakes and began 

to run out the clock, heading into the final media 
timeout up by 11 and holding a lead they would 
never relinquish. In the end, the lead Michigan had 
painstakingly grown throughout the second half 
proved too large for Indiana to overcome.

“For our team we’re in a different position than 

we’ve ever been in before,” Barnes Arico said. “We 
always talk about “the hunted”, you know, and we’re 
in a different position. How are we handling that? 
And I think each game, each new game we have to 
remember people are coming for us like we are here 
now. We’re going to get everyone’s best shot.”
