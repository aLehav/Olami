In late February, Kaplan 
Test 
Prep 
released 
their 
annual law school admissions 
officers survey, an analysis 
that 
attempts 
to 
measure 
student interest in attending 
law school. After years of 
decline, 
Kaplan 
reported 
an increase of over 4,000 
applicants. The cause, they 
reported, was the chaotic 
state of the political climate.
In a survey of 121 different 
law 
schools, 
encompassing 
some of the top 50 in the 
nation as ranked by U.S. News 
and World Report, about 87 
percent of those surveyed 
reported the current U.S. 

political climate was a critical 
factor in their decision to 
attend law school.

Anthony 
Coloca, 

Kaplan’s director of pre-law 
programs, 
was 
confident 
their 
findings 
were 
more 
than 
circumstantial. 
In 
a 
second survey of law school 
students, 45 percent agreed 
politics were a significant 
component of their decision. 
Furthermore, 57 percent said 
they planned to use their 
degree to advocate for public 
policy 
concerns 
they 
felt 
strongly about.

Decorated 
with 
signature 
Taiwanese 
yellow 
lanterns, 
the East Hall atriums were 
transformed 
for 
the 
annual 
Taste of Taiwan event Saturday. 
Co-hosted by the Taiwanese 
American Student Association, 
Taiwanese Student Association 
and Michigan Taiwanese Student 
Associations, the event featured 
a variety of Taiwanese food and 
street games from the streets 
of Taiwan’s famous Keelung 
Miaokou Night Market. 
Elton Lin, an Engineering 
freshman who helped organize 
the event, said the event aimed 
to celebrate Taiwanese culture 
as well as to bring different 
Taiwanese student organizations 
together. 

“For us, I think it’s important 
because this not only represents a 
big part of our culture, we also had 
the opportunity to work together 
with other organizations,” Lin 
said. “Even though we are all 
related to Taiwanese culture, we 
are still different organizations 
on campus. It is good for us to 
work together to show people our 
culture.”
The events were divided into 
three sections: food, games and 
performance. The food selection 
included braised pork rice, stir-
fried cabbage, three cup chicken, 
fried rice vermicelli, salt pepper 
chicken, winter melon grass jelly 
tea and shaved ice.
LSA senior Jason Wong said 
the food was a great starting 
point to introduce people to a 
different culture, accompanying 

performances and art forms. He 
said food can be an additional 
incentive for more people to come 
to cultural events on campus.
“I 
have 
seen 
a 
lot 
of 
performances this year already,” 
Wong said. “They are all really 
good, 
but 
having 
delicious 
and authentic food like this is 
definitely a good incentive to get 
more people.”
LSA junior Jeremy Yun also 
thought the food was a huge part 
of what made the event successful.
“The food is really good,” Yun 
said. “I have never tried a lot of 
these foods before, and it is really 
interesting to see a lot of the 
Taiwanese culture being soaked 
into all these food stands.”
Alongside the food stands were 
activity areas where participants 
participated 
in 
traditional 

activities often seen at Taiwanese 
night markets such as ring toss, 
can knockdown, chopstick skills 
and bottle balancing. 
LSA freshman David Sigler 
tried many of the games and food 
at the event and was happy with 
his experience.
“There is a lot of food and they 
are all pretty good, the games are 
really interesting,” Sigler said. “It’s 
also got a nice turnout and people 
seem to be having a good time.”
Besides foods and games, 
there was also a performance in 
the East Hall Auditorium. The 
performance started with a group 
of dancers from K-Motion, an all-
female Korean pop dance group. 

On Friday, the Ford School 
of Public Policy hosted keynote 
speaker 
Rohit 
Chopra, 
a 
commissioner 
on 
the 
Federal 
Trade Commission, to discuss 
the vulnerability consumers face 
when seeking a loan, as part of the 
Consumer Protection in an Age of 
Uncertainty conference. Chopra 
was one speaker among a number 
of other panelists, including the 
previous day’s keynote speaker 
Richard Cordray, former founding 
director of the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau. 
Chopra was an assistant director 
at the CFPB, where he served as 
the organization’s first student loan 
ombudsman — helping to establish 
federal guidelines that dictate 
policy and management of student 
loans 
and 
for-profit 
colleges. 
He was confirmed as an FTC 
commissioner with unanimous 
support from the Senate in April 
2018.
The talk was structured as a 
conversation between Chopra and 
Public Policy Dean Michael Barr, 
who facilitated the discussion.

Omega Beta Eta to create a sense of community, provide mentors with common experiences

Friday night, the founding 
line of Omega Beta Eta, the 
University of Michigan’s first 
Arab 
fraternity, 
revealed 
their 
pledge 
class 
with 
a 
performance 
on 
the 
Diag. 
Each of the 16 recruits, clad 

in black robes with red-and-
black 
keffiyehs 
 
partially 
covering their faces, introduced 
themselves 
to 
a 
cheering 
crowd comprised of students 
and other organizations in the 
Multicultural Greek Council. 
The event started at 8:34 pm, 
which had a significance within 
the fraternity.

OBH founder Jad Elharake, 
an LSA alum who works at the 
University of Michigan Medical 
School in the Office for Health 
Equity and Inclusion, noted 
OBH was established to create a 
sense of community among Arab 
men that did not previously exist 
at the University.
“A part of me always wished 

that I had an older Arab male 
mentor — one that not only 
understood my background, but 
lived it,” Elharake wrote in an 
email interview with The Daily. 
“A mentor that would guide me 
in navigating a place that wasn’t 
built for me.”

On Saturday, Epsilon Alpha 
Sigma, the University of Michigan’s 
first Arab sorority, and the Multi-
Ethnic Student Association held a 
banquet to raise money for Syrian 
refugees 
through 
Friends 
of 
Kayany, a non-profit that supports 
education for Syrian children living 
in Informal Tented Settlements in 
Lebanon. EAS was also granted a 
charter at the event, elevating them 
from a colony to a chapter of the 
national Arab sorority.
The event, titled “Remembering 
the Refugees,” took place at the 
Ross School of Business Blau 
Colloquium and featured spoken 
word 
artist 
Omar 
Offendum, 
Friends 
of 
Kayany 
treasurer 
Bandar Shawwaf and EAS founder 
Rula Othman. About 140 students 
and community members were 
in attendance at the annual event. 
The event has been running since 
2012. 
The sorority surpassed their 
fundraising goal of $8,000 to raise 
a total of $9,400 for Friends of 
Kayany throughout the semester.

OBH is not the first Arab 
fraternity 
in 
the 
nation. 
However, Elharake said the 
founders of OBH decided to 
create their own fraternity so 
they could build the traditions of 
the group themselves. 
Before presenting themselves 
to the audience, the brothers 
of OBH recognized the other 
multicultural fraternities and 
sororities attending the event. 
Members of other organizations, 
including Sigma Lambda Beta 
fraternity and Sigma Sigma Rho 
sorority, responded with chants 
and calls of support.
Kneeling huddled together in 
a circle, the brothers introduced 
themselves 
one 
by 
one 
by 
standing and removing their 
scarves and robes. Elharake 
brought each recruit to the 
middle of the circle and took 
away 
their 
scarves 
before 
stepping out. Amid chants of 

“ossoud,” or “lion” in Arabic, 
each member then revealed his 
name and pledged to support 
his fellow brothers. Many of the 
members introduced themselves 
through rap. 
Ahmad Saad, Business senior 
and OBH brother, said each 
member of the fraternity was 
given a lion name prior to the 
reveal. According to Saad, these 
names are given by members and 
denote certain characteristics 
about the recruit, like leadership 
or courage. Saad’s lion name is 
“Bassel”. 
“Immigrating 
from 
Bint 
Jebail, my parents don’t have 
it easy,” Saad rapped. “They 
look to me to carry their legacy. 
Strongest of the pack, I protect 
my brothers — no matter what 
it is, we’re always here for each 
other. Ballin’ since I was a kid, 
I’m the real MVP. The best 
there ever was, I got that lion 
mentality. Yeah, I go to Ross, I’m 
a different kind of lion. Imma 
build stacks on stacks without 
even trying. My brothers are 

my priority, and like lions in the 
jungle, we lead with authority.”
The 
creation 
of 
OBH 
comes just four months after 
the 
University’s 
first 
Arab 
sorority, Epsilon Alpha Sigma 
Empowered Arab Sisterhood, 
introduced its first pledge class 
in a reveal show held in Angell 
Hall. EAS, which has chapters at 
several other universities, is the 
first Arab sorority in the nation. 
Silan Fadlallah, LSA junior 
and president of EAS, said it 
was important for her sorority 
to attend OBH’s reveal show 
because 
EAS 
had 
received 
support from the University’s 
Arab community at their own 
debut performance.
“We’re here to show solidarity 
and support them, because we 
were the first Arab sorority to 
come to the campus and we 
know what that feels like,” 
Fadlallah said. “We’re not sisters 
with them, but we’re here to 
support them.” 
In 
2017, 
Elharake 
helped 
organize 
the 
#WeExist 
campaign to add a Middle 
Eastern/North 
African 
identity category to University 
applications and documents. 
In December 2018, Rackham 
announced plans to include 
Middle Eastern and North 
African identity options on 
applications for Fall 2019. 
Elharake 
said 
his 
work 
with this campaign and his 
decision to found OBH reflect 
his desire to bring awareness 
to the Arab identity on 
campus. 
“Every year, I see Arab 
men who come to U-M, 
ignore the community on 
campus, forget their roots 
and cave into the pressures 
of attending a predominantly 
white institution,” Elharake 
said. “My experiences fueled 
my desire to create, with the 
founding fathers, a peer-to-
peer structure for Arab men 
to mentor each other.”
Fadlallah 
echoed 
Elharake’s statement and said 
organizations like EAS and 
OBH aim to draw attention 
to the presence of a distinctly 
Arab identity at the University 

and around the country. 
“The Arab identity as a race 
is often unrecognized and goes 
unrecognized because we don’t 
have a checkbox if you’re filling 
out applications or whatever,” 
Fadlallah said. “We’re marked 
under white, which isn’t true. A 
lot of it has to do with advocating 
for that Middle Eastern and 
North African checkbox and, 
within that, the Arab identity.”
Throughout the performance, 
the 
recruits 
referred 
to 
themselves as lions, the symbol 
of the fraternity. According 
to Elharake, the symbolism 
harkens back to when Asiatic 
lions lived across the Middle 
East and North Africa. While 
Asiatic lions still live in sub-
Saharan Africa, there are very 
few left in the Middle East. In 
a text message to The Daily, 
Elharake said the members of 
OBH and the Arab community 
at the University embody the 
history of the Asiatic lions.
“Their 
story 
has 
become 
our story,” Elharake said. “For 
decades, most Arab men at 
the University did not hold 
leadership 
positions 
across 
campus, take advantage of the 
opportunities 
and 
resources 
offered or advocate for the Arab 
community. In many ways, we 
were extinct.”
Saad 
mentioned 
how 
the 
performance was meant to be 
both a humorous introduction 
to the group and a reflection on 
one the organization’s official 
slogans: “Protect what’s yours, 
even when they claim it’s theirs.” 
Saad said this underlying theme 
expresses 
the 
more 
serious 
aspects of the reveal show. 
“It’s to show how we’re serious 
about what we’re doing — we 
put in a lot of work in rehearsal 
and we wanted everything to be 
very structured and organized in 
conveying our message instead 
of being disorganized,” Saad 
said. “It really highlights the 
consistency and how serious we 
are about this.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Michigan in Color
Monday, March 25, 2019 — 3A

My name is Haleemah Aqel. 
I am a graduate of the class 
of 2018. I am a Palestinian 
Muslim American woman. I 
serve as the current program 
coordinator at the Program 
on Intergroup Relations. I 
am one of the founders of the 
Islamophobia Working Group. 
I was the head organizer of the 
New Zealand Mosque Vigil on 
Saturday, March 16. I’ve spent 
the last few days processing the 
events of Saturday.
I tend not to publicly share 
my thoughts with people. 
However, I have seen many 
individuals on campus joke, 
ignore, or fail to acknowledge 
both the attacks in New 
Zealand and the Saturday 
incident and their traumatic 
effects on individuals in the 
community -- specifically the 
Muslim community present at 
the vigil. For that reason, I have 
decided to share my thoughts 
starting on Saturday afternoon.
Saturday, March 16th. 12:38 
p.m.
I wake up. I slept in, which is 
unusual for me. Something felt 
off. I open my phone to texts 
and emails about the vigil at 4 
PM. I call my mom telling her I 
already felt off about the day. I 
knew I was still mourning the 
victims of the New Zealand 
mosque terrorist attack, but 
I tried my best to pull myself 
together to finalize the vigil 
schedule and gather the list of 
innocent lives lost.
2 p.m.
I text one of the other 
organizers of the vigil asking 
her what she thought about 
the possibility of cancelling the 
vigil. Something didn’t seem 
right, or safe, about having the 
vigil when numerous students 
would be participating in St. 
Patrick’s 
Day 
festivities. 
I 
was scared. I kept imagining 
someone running into the 
crowd and attacking students 
— like I said before, something 
definitely did not feel right at 

all.
I email the other organizers, 
but they convince me that 
everything would be okay. I 
believe them.
3:40 p.m.
I walk out of my apartment. 
I make my way to Espresso 
Royale on State Street to buy 
a coffee to ease my nerves. I 
make my purchase and begin 
my walk to the Diag. I pass 
by familiar faces and smile as 
I walk towards the steps of 
Hatcher. The sunny sky soon 
turns grey.
3:55 p.m.
Volunteer 
speakers 
walk 
up to greet me. I give them 
their speaking order. Another 
organizer arrives with the box 
of candles. Professor Samer Ali 
calls for the large crowd of 200 
individuals to gather around. 
We pass out the candles.
4:05 p.m.
The vigil begins. Samer 
gives 
opening 
marks, 
commemorating the lives of 
those taken from hate crimes 
and acts of terror since 2011. 
I look around. I see members 
of all different identities in 
the crowd. I recognize more 
familiar faces as they nod their 
heads towards me. I begin to 
tear up. I pull myself together 
knowing I am standing in front 
of hundreds of people.
4:10 p.m.
Members of the Muslim 
Student 
Association 
begin 
with their words. A verse of the 
Quran is recited. The beautiful 
and peaceful words soothe 
the crowd and my nerves. The 
sounds of the Quran bring me 
back to a safe haven. Another 
individual proceeds to recite 
the English translation.
4:15 p.m.
It is now my turn to speak. 
I walk up to the microphone. I 
take a deep breath. I introduce 
myself. I usually have a loud 
voice, but my voice is soft. 
My hands begin to shake as I 
hold one candle in one hand 
and my phone in the other. I 
pause before I begin to call 
out the names of the victims 
so far counted as dead by 

New Zealand officials. Not 
all of the names of the 51 
victims (at the time) were 
announced. I encourage the 
crowd to remember these 
victims, not just as victims, 
but as individuals with stories 
and experiences. That we 
will remember their beautiful 
lives and never forget them. I 
conclude my words. The next 
few speakers follow me.
4:30 p.m. 
State Representative Yousef 
Rabhi speaks. I’m nervous once 
again. Elected officials could 
serve as targets to the public. 
He concludes his speech and 

steps off of the steps.
4:34 p.m.
Another volunteer begins to 
speak. Yet, this time her poem 
is about Palestine. The nature 
of anyone discussing Palestine, 
especially in such a public space, 
has always put me on edge. 
Speaking about the injustices in 
Palestine on the University of 
Michigan campus has always 
brought some controversy. I 
immediately 
remember 
the 
time students had yelled at 
me 
and 
other 
Palestinian 
students for a peaceful display 
a few years back in the Diag. 
My mind begins to race. The 
speaker discusses the nature of 
violence against Palestinians in 
Palestine and how it is similar 
to acts of white supremacy in 
the world. I begin to remember 
my times in Palestine and 

my beautiful memories with 
family. I start tearing up again. 
I put my head down for a 
second and when I looked up, 
my life flashes before me.
4:35 p.m.
I will never forget this 
moment.
I see two cops running into 
the crowd from East side of the 
Diag. I see them run before I 
hear them. I instantly freeze, 
my legs tense up. I hear the 
cops scream “MOVE, MOVE, 
MOVE” as they run into the 
crowd.
This image continues to 
replay in my head.

My 
immediate 
thoughts 
were: someone in the crowd 
has a gun. Someone in the 
crowd has a bomb.
My adrenaline spikes as I 
sprint up the rest of the steps 
into Hatcher to take cover. 
Maybe I would be a target, 
I thought. Maybe they were 
aiming for me. I didn’t look 
back. I had no idea what was 
happening. 
Why 
was 
this 
happening?
I instantly run into the side 
rooms. I see students studying 
and yell we need to hide. We 
need to take cover. I run with 
them into the North Stacks. I 
begin to cry.
4:46 p.m.
We find a space hidden in the 
stacks. I immediately open up 
my Facebook and Twitter on 
my phone, updating everyone 

that I’m safe.
4:48 p.m.
My phone soon blows up 
with text messages, twitter 
notifications and numerous 
calls. 
My sister messages me. She 
asks me if I’m okay. She asks me 
where I’m hiding. I tell her I’m 
safe and that I love her. I told 
her to update my mom and let 
her know I’m safe.
Friends begin to call and 
text me. I’m surrounded by 15 
students. Each student sends 
similar texts to family. Many 
of us crying. We do a calming 
exercise.
These could be my last 
moments. I send ‘I love you’ 
texts to close friends. I check 
my pockets and grasp the 
fluorescent candle in my hand.
Everything from this point 
on is a blur to me.
5:17 p.m.
I’m still hiding in Hatcher. 
I continue to receive updates. 
We are told that a gunman is in 
the UGLi now. My whole body 
feels numb.
Again, everything is a blur to 
me.
5:50 p.m.
We immediately evacuate to 
the basement of Hatcher.
The PA system in Hatcher 
finally goes off. We are given 
the OK to leave from the south 
doors. I evacuate with 20 
students. We are escorted to 
South University.
I am not well. I felt sick. 
My hands were shaking. I 
wanted to throw up. I begin 
crying again. Many random 
individuals begin to hug me. I 
walk away.
6:00 p.m.
I walk off campus alone to 
the apartment where other 
attendees of the vigil were.
 I feel faint. I sit down on the 
ground and open my phone 
once again. I call my mom. I 
told her everything was okay. I 
was angry. I really was not okay. 
I recall the moments of 4:35PM 
again and again. The image of 
the police officers running into 
the crowd haunts me.
7:00 p.m.

I am driven home where two 
friends stop by later to comfort 
me. I continue to receive more 
texts. I receive a call from the 
Michigan Daily asking for a 
quote. I provide them with my 
statement. My friends leave 
and I am alone. I am hesitant to 
ask other friends to come over. 
I don’t want to burden anyone.
8:30 p.m.
I contemplate leaving my 
apartment. I feel closed in. I 
feel lonely. I call some friends 
to pass the time. I am still 
shaking. People continue to 
text me asking about the vigil. 
My mind is racing.
10:00 p.m.
My best friend texts me 
telling me not to leave my 
apartment alone since I was 
the head organizer. I am on 
edge because she warns me of 
being a target. I shower and 
begin to cry as the water races 
down on my body. My tears 
are washed away. I silence my 
phone, ignoring any calls.
12:00 a.m., Sunday, March 
17th
I spend the rest of the night 
locked in my bedroom. Any 
noise immediately startles me. 
I can’t sleep.
I end up falling asleep 
around 2:00 a.m. or so.
5:30 a.m.
I wake up from a nightmare 
screaming, 
“Help!” 
I 
immediately start crying. I call 
my brother, he calms me down. 
I’m shaking and I immediately 
run into my bathroom almost 
throwing up. I stay awake. I’m 
too scared to go back to sleep.
8 a.m.
I decide to open my phone 
at this time. I check my email. 
My inbox is flooded. Hate mail, 
news inquires, old professors 
reaching out asking if I’m okay. 
I text a friend to meet up. 
10:30 a.m.
I end up going to the gym 
later that morning with that 
friend. 

A few weeks ago, I was 
scrolling through Instagram 
when I actually paused for a 
second: two photos had caught 
my eye. One was of a Japanese 
family in kimonos at a temple, 
faces turned away from the 
camera; the other was of a 
Vietnamese family, a father 
and son, their faces also turned 
away from the camera.
These were not photos 
taken by a photojournalist — 
they were images taken by 
a college student studying 
abroad in Asia. And for some 
reason, they made me slightly 
discomfited.
It might have been the 
fact that in both photos, the 
families’ gazes were turned 
away 
from 
the 
camera, 
preoccupied with whatever 
they were doing in the moment. 
I wondered — did these people 
know their photos were being 
taken? Did the student have 
their consent?
In these photos, subjects 
were transformed into objects 
to be gazed upon. They were 
another part of the foreign, 
exoticized landscape, blending 
into 
stereotypical 
images 
associated 
with 
people 
who live in these countries: 
individuals wearing kimonos 
in Japan, individuals in rural 
Vietnam.
I wondered — if the student 

was studying abroad in 
Europe, would she have 
taken photos like these, 
of 
random 
strangers 
living their lives? Perhaps 
in 
a 
specific 
cultural 
context, like Oktoberfest 
in Germany or flamenco 
dancers in Spain. But would 
she ever be compelled to 
stop and take a photo of 
random strangers by their 
houses or other buildings? 
I could see the same thing 
happening 
in 
African, 
Middle Eastern and Latin 
American countries — but 
not necessarily European 
countries.
Yes, the student might 
have 
taken 
the 
photo 
because she thought the 
people looked interesting 
and 
“exotic”. 
Yes, 
she 
might have taken it as 
appreciation of the country 
she was visiting and to 
share 
that 
with 
other 
people. But it’s important 
to consider the current 
and historical contexts of 
travelers 
photographing 
people in foreign countries 
in ways that are steeped 
in colonialism and the 
fetishization 
of 
those 
people and that landscape 
that renders them objects 
to look at rather than actual 
humans. It isn’t just regular 
tourists that perpetuate 
this either — popular and 
well-established 
media 
do it, too (see: National 

Geographic).
The photos also reminded 
me 
of 
similar, 
though 
different, kinds of images that 
are often uploaded to social 
media. These are the photos 
of volunteers with the people 
they are supposedly helping. 
And 
the 
volunteers 
are 
usually white, and the people 
are usually non-white and 
live in low-income countries 
with entrenched histories of 
colonialism and exploitation 

from the West.
These 
photos 
often 
perpetuate the problematic 
white savior complex, wherein 
a white volunteer goes to a 
(usually) 
non-European 
country on a volunteer project 
with ideas of “saving” the local 
population there, who are 
deemed to be in need of help.

W

hatever 
happened 
to 
predictability? 
No, 
seriously 
— 
what happened to 
it? Because there 
is no universe in 
which any of us 
predicted 
Aunt 
Becky would be 
charged 
with 
felonies, but life 
is funny that way. 
After 
everyone 
finished cracking 
jokes about the 
developments 
of 
the past week, it looked pretty 
bad for a lot of people and 
schools (thankfully, not this 
one. Go Blue).
There was a lot to be 
surprised 
and 
upset 
about 
— that parents were buying 
their students’ spots paying 
someone else to take their tests, 
that schools were letting their 
athletic directors work without 
almost any oversight and most 
importantly 
that 
someone 
would pay $500,000 to be 
admitted into the University of 
Southern California when they 
could light the money on fire 
instead.
However, there was one 
silver lining and it’s something 
important of which we cannot 
afford to lose sight (and it’s 
not because we spent our last 
half million at USC). It is that 
those schools are, to an extent, 
overrated. 
Having 
an 
Ivy 
League degree is no guarantor 
of success, but that idea is 
implanted in so many minds in 
high school, middle school and 
even elementary school.
I have heard from past 
middle school teachers of mine 
that sixth grade students were 
crying about a B because it 
might hurt their chance to get 
into Harvard. Whatever else 
that is, it is also wrong beyond 
words. This much stress only 
exists for one reason: It is 
because we have all lied to 
ourselves. We are the ones 
who decided that a Harvard 
degree is worth what it is — 
not Harvard. And the same is 
true for Stanford, Yale and this 
school too. Part of what makes 
these degrees so valuable is that 
the supply is so low.
According to Bloomberg, 

in 1999, Harvard’s full-time 
undergraduate enrollment was 
roughly 6,816 students. Turn 
the 
clock 
forward 
to 2017 and it was a 
grand total of 6,699 
students. For the sake 
of comparison, in 1999 
there were around 6 
billion people in the 
world and in 2017 there 
were 7.5 billion. The 
population of the world 
grew by more than a 
billion and Harvard’s 
enrollment 
actually 
shrunk by about a hundred. 
Another way of looking at this 
is that the population of the 
world grew by 25 percent and 
the 
Harvard 
undergraduate 
enrollment dropped about 2 
percent.

In addition to this, the 
number 
of 
students 
who 
applied to college grew as well. 
All of this is a polite way of 
saying we value these degrees 
so much because they’re so 
hard to get, and they’re so 
hard to get because so many 
apply for them. So many apply 
for them because of how much 
we value them. This is a self-
perpetuating cycle and will 
always be, unless, for some 
reason, we as a society begin 
to value these elite degrees a 
whole lot less.
I believe, after many years, 
we have found that reason. 
There’s an idea that not all fraud 
is caught. This may mean that, 
in some cases, scams could go 
on for years until it eventually 
blows up in someone’s face 
(see this college scam for one 
example — for another, look at 
Bernie Madoff). It also might 
not blow up at all — which is to 
say we have no idea what kind 
of fraud is being committed 
and we will not have any idea 

of this until it comes out in the 
paper. This is a clear example of 
Donald Rumsfeld’s “unknown 
unknown” — we assume there 
is fraud going on but we aren’t 
positive about it or about what 
it looks like until it’s staring us 
in the face.
However, once fraud of 
some type is revealed, there 
does tend to be more suspicion 
of those who let it happen. One 
example of this is how hated 
much of Wall Street was after 
the 2008 stock market crash. 
That wasn’t fraud as much as it 
was shady business practices, 
but the point stands. After the 
crash, a good number wanted 
to burn the CEOs of Goldman 
Sachs, Lehman Brothers and 
the like at the stake. I think we 
have found a reason to value 
these elite degrees a lot less 
because we do not know which 
students had their entrance and 
admission paid for and which 
students actually earned theirs.
There will be more suspicion 
of those degrees in years to come, 
and that is good. This is because 
having a Harvard degree doesn’t 
mean you’re a decent person or 
you’re super smart. What it does 
mean, though, is you got lucky. 
Whether it be lucky enough to 
have parents who could buy your 
way into the university (albeit 
unartfully), or be it the luck of 
getting your application read 
by someone on the admissions 
board sympathetic to you, it 
had a lot to do with luck. This 
is because there is really no 
academic difference between all 
the 4.0/36 kids who got the thin 
envelope and those who got the 
fat one.
There is nothing wrong 
with that, but now that this 
admissions scandal has forced 
us to examine how people got 
into these schools, maybe we’ll 
value those schools less since 
all it took was luck and money, 
and no one can be faulted for not 
having those. That devaluation 
is 
an 
unrequited 
positive 
good that has come from this 
mess. In other words, mission 
accomplished, 
ladies 
and 
gentlemen.

I 

was sitting with my two 
best friends in a dorm 
room, laughing after an 
afternoon of St. Patrick’s Day 
celebrations, when one of us 
received the first text from 
a friend. “There’s an active 
shooter in Mason Hall,” he said 
to me. “That’s not a funny joke 
to make,” I responded, hoping 
he was kidding but knowing he 
wasn’t from the serious look on 
his face. This initial message, 
followed by many more, sent 
us into a frenzy of checking 
all our group chats, texting 
and calling everyone we knew 
and telling them to stay away 
from the Diag, stay indoors 
and stay safe. My brother was 
in the Shapiro Undergraduate 
Library, and I had to beg him 
in a series of texts to interrupt 
his exam studying and call me, 
thinking he was a minute away 
from an active shooting. The 
only sound among the three 
of us for the next 30 minutes 
was the tapping of our phone 
screens and the static of an 
online police scanner that we 
should not have been listening 
to.
Saturday’s 
false 
alarm 
was stressful and damaging 
for a variety of reasons — the 
University of Michigan’s blatant 
emergency response problems, 
the further trauma inflicted 
on the Muslim community, 
the spread of misinformation 
and conflicting rumors that 
heightened 
fear. 
But 
what 
struck me most deeply about 
this event was how, despite it 
being a false alarm, students 
were instinctively preparing 
for the worst. The second that 
an initial report went out, and 
before the University or the 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security or any news source 
addressed campus, students 
sprung 
into 
a 
variety 
of 
immediate, fear-driven actions. 
An unconfirmed report with 
no official comment gained 
instant credibility and led to 
prompt student response. But 

living in the United States, can 
you blame us?
Columbine. Virginia Tech. 
Sandy Hook. Parkland. Growing 
up in a country that from 
2009 to 2018 had 57 times 
more school shootings than 
other industrialized nations, 
is thinking that the University 
of Michigan could join the list 
of places national tragedies 
have occurred irrational? The 
recent, targeted shooting at 
two New Zealand mosques 
was the first mass shooting to 
occur in the nation in over 20 
years. Conversely, the United 
States has had a conservative 
estimate of 90 mass shootings 
since 1997, according to an 
open-source 
database 
by 
Mother Jones. In a study 
published earlier this month 
by The BMJ, it was shown 
states with weaker gun laws 
had more mass shootings, and 
there are more mass shootings 
in areas with higher rates 
of gun ownership. But even 
outside of these horrific stories 
that are oftentimes claimed 
by 
conservatives 
as 
being 
sensationalized, 
the 
United 
States still has the highest rate 
of murder and manslaughter 
by firearms in the developed 
world. It’s hard to not see the 
connection between access to 
guns and harm.
Being exposed to this scale 
of gun violence has pushed 
the threat of an active shooter 
situation to the forefront of 
my mind more than a few 
times, 
and 
that 
weekend 
made that fear all the more 
prominent, while making me 
more sensitive to an issue I 
have been culturally trained 
to tune out. This is something 
I know that many of my fellow 
students have felt too. This is 
the time to channel that fear 
and concern into productive 
dialogue about gun policy and 
emergency procedures.
The gun debate in the 
United States is tense and 
passionate. But as much as 

our current political climate 
has made us feel increasingly 
polarized on either side, the 
only way to achieve what 
should be a common goal among 
all Americans — decreasing 
deaths — is by considering the 
data, looking to international 
comparisons 
and 
enacting 
compromises that bring us 
closer to safe gun regulation. 
Because as of now, I see no 
reason why roughly a third of 
American gun owners have been 
able to buy their guns without a 
background check. So instead of 
screaming “no guns, yes guns” 
at each other from opposite 
sides of the chamber, why don’t 
we enact common-sense gun 
laws that will keep the volume 
of guns down while insuring 
that the remaining firearms are 
in the hands of nonthreatening 
citizens?
The 
events 
of 
last 
weekend have caused a lot 
of residual stress within our 
campus climate, but there 
is potential for it to be used 
for beneficial progress, both 
politically 
and 
within 
the 
University community. In the 
foreseeable future, continue 
to 
demand 
the 
University 
has a line of communication 
about its emergency response 
measures, and actually give 
your input on how they can 
be improved upon. Use these 
spaces 
to 
encourage 
the 
University to enact clearer 
and 
more 
comprehensive 
active shooter protocols to 
keep us safe in the instance 
of an actual emergency. And 
in a continuous push, contact 
your 
local 
and 
national 
representatives. 
Press 
gun 
control as a platform plank. 
Keep it at the forefront of the 
conversation and don’t wait 
for another tragedy to occur. 
Work so the next generation 
doesn’t have to be so afraid.

The power of community following the false alert
T

he 
texts 
that 
bombarded 
my 
phone 
last 
Saturday 
afternoon will remain etched 
in my mind for the rest of 
my life. “Run. Hide. Active 
shoot (sic) on the Diag. RUN.” 
While I couldn’t comprehend 
what was happening in that 
moment, I knew this day 
would quickly become a day I 
would never forget.
For the next four hours, 
with each “ping,” my phone 
continued 
to 
make 
my 
heart 
drop 
even 
further. 
As I sat in the safety of my 
apartment, I was nowhere 
near comfortable, knowing my 
best friends and community 
members feared they may be 
living the last moments of 
their lives.
I sat in my living room 
frozen 
and 
expressionless, 
holding 
back 
tears 
every 
time one of my friends didn’t 
answer his or her phone. 
My heart raced each time 
I heard rumors the alleged 
gunman was getting closer to 
my apartment or where my 
friends were. I feared for my 
safety and dreaded losing the 
people dearest to my heart. I 
worried about getting to class 
safely and walking home late 
from the library. I stopped 
at the idea that our safety as 
students is not a guarantee 
and tomorrow is not promised.
Last 
Friday, 
two 
New 
Zealand mosques faced an 
act of terrorism executed by 
a white supremacist who took 
the lives of at least 50 people 
and wounded at least another 
50. The terrorist responsible 
for these acts of violence 
live-streamed his attacks on 
Facebook for the world to see. 
While Facebook had the video 
down within minutes, it has 
circulated to various online 
platforms and generated over 
one million views. In addition 
to his live-stream, the shooter 
also 
released 
a 
manifesto 
highlighting 
his 
white 
supremacist views, in which 
he praised President Donald 
Trump and voiced his support 
for Trump’s views.

The 
Muslim 
community 
around the world has been 
put under extreme pressure 
to openly express its identity 
during a trying time of bigotry. 
With 
popular 
figures 
like 
Trump continuing to fuel the 
energy and passion of white 
supremacists, xenophobia has 
continued to rise along with 
the daily fear of being openly 
Muslim in today’s society. 

Many 
communities 
have 
come 
together 
to 
express 
their support by acts of unity. 
The University of Michigan’s 
Islamophobia Working Group 
and 
the 
Muslim 
Student 
Association planned and came 
together for a vigil Saturday to 
express their solidarity for the 
community and pay respect 
to the lives lost to senseless 
violence. The vigil was quickly 
broken up by police shouting 
for the attendees to run. With 
no 
explanation 
or 
further 
instructions, 
attendees 
of 
the vigil ran for their lives, 
getting trampled and dropping 
belongings along the way.
Just 
as 
the 
Muslim 
community in New Zealand 
was attacked the safe space 
of their place of worship, the 
threat the Muslim community 
at the University felt was 
also in the safe space of their 
campus community.
While the reports of an 
active shooter threat were false 
alarms, the trauma that existed 
within the Muslim and Arab 
communities and their allies 
was certainly not a false alarm. 
The lack of response I saw from 
faculty 
and 
administration 
regarding the active shooter 
threat 
downplays 
the 

emotional trauma that a group 
of 
predominantly 
minority 
students felt that day. The lack 
of concern from these bodies 
made the University a place 
where students felt alienated 
rather than one where they 
could find solace.
Before the University had 
even officially issued an “all-
clear” to the active shooter 
threats, students had already 
began circulating and sending 
memes and jokes about the 
incident 
and 
completely 
undermining the real fear felt 
by many of their peers, some 
who were still barricaded in 
classrooms, hiding to save 
their lives.
The lives of my people are 
worth more than a meme. The 
emotional toll my community 
has faced deserves more than 
a “just get over it, nothing 
really happened.” The reality 
is the emotional trauma that 
minority 
groups 
face 
will 
simply continue to be ignored. 
Had this threat affected a 
predominantly white group of 
students, the University would 
not have reacted the same way. 
Muslim 
students 
and 
their 
allies were expected to carry on 
as normal in the days following, 
whether it was going to work 
the next morning or taking an 
organic chemistry exam less 
than 48 hours later. Official 
statements 
from 
University 
administration were scarce and 
the sentiment on campus was 
business as usual.
While the greater campus 
community may not have come 
through for us that weekend, 
I realized the strength and 
beauty in our smaller Muslim 
and Arab communities here on 
campus. Whether it was letting 
people hide for safety in each 
other’s apartments or simply 
offering to talk to affected 
students, 
my 
communities 
came together in a time of 
need 
and 
highlighted 
the 
importance of celebrating our 
unity in diversity.

T

o our fellow students 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 
the 
University of Michigan Chapter 
of alpha Kappa Delta Phi would 
like to sincerely apologize for 
the events that took place last 
Saturday as a result of our 
actions. Last week, a group of 
our members had planned a 
bonding event that involved 
team-building 
activities, 
including one that involved 
popping balloons that set off 
the false shooter alert. We are 
truly sorry to everyone who 
feared for their lives and had 
to experience the traumatic 
events of that day, especially 
to our fellow Muslim students 
and 
all 
those 
who 
were 
present at the New Zealand 
Mosques Solidarity Vigil. It is 
unacceptable to merely pass off 
our actions as a poorly timed 
coincidence. To do so would 
be to ignore the politically-
charged atmosphere that day 
and the many serious events on 
campus that preceded the false 

alarm. Failure to acknowledge 
these 
circumstances 
would 
only further enable us to benefit 
from the privilege that comes 
with a lack of understanding 
about the real dangers and 
fears that many of our fellow 
peers, students of color and 
Muslim students live with on a 
day to day basis.
We also want to acknowledge 
our 
silence 
and 
delay 
in 
responding to the events of last 
week. As part of a large and 
diverse community of color, 
we understand that everyone 
perceives 
and 
processes 
traumatic events in different 
ways and at different speeds. 
We have used this past week to 
not only process our feelings of 
guilt and disbelief, but to also 
reflect on our mistakes and take 
responsibility for our actions 
by reaching out to members of 
our immediate communities. 
We take this event as a stark 
realization that we need to 
further 
educate 
ourselves 
about 
Islamophobia, 
white 

supremacy and what it means 
to use our position as A/PIA 
students to participate in more 
meaningful coalition building 
on campus. Moving forward, 
we are committed to standing 
together in solidarity with our 
fellow Muslim students and 
marginalized communities on 
campus by holding necessary 
conversations and taking the 
right steps towards being more 
cognizant of our actions. While 
our words cannot undo the 
trauma that was experienced 
that day, we will use Saturday’s 
events as a way to further 
educate ourselves more about 
social justice and to empower 
and uplift our fellow Muslim 
community and communities 
of color.
Respectfully,
The University of Michigan 
Chapter of alpha Kappa Delta

NOW.

It’s fitting that Jordan Peele, 
whose reimagining of “The 
Twilight Zone” will premiere 
this April, crafted his follow-
up to cultural juggernaut “Get 
Out” by making an essentially 
extended version of a “Twilight 
Zone” 
episode. 
His 
latest 
feature film, “Us,” is a tightly 
wound horror-thriller much in 
the same vein as “Get Out,” but 
rather than being grounded in 
the answers it provides, the 
power of “Us” comes in the 
questions it leaves lingering in 
its wake.
The story surrounds the four 
members of the Wilson family 
as they are confronted by 
dopplegangers of themselves 
during 
a 
pleasant 
summer 
vacation to Santa Cruz 
beach. To reveal any more 
of the plot beyond this 
would be to take away 
from the twist-riddled, 
reflective and thought-
provoking experience of 
the movie. It’s practically 
impossible to talk about 
the big ideas “Us” posits 
without spoiling the fun, 
so I’ll avoid them for the 
most part.
By 
far, 
my 
favorite 
aspect of the film was 
Lupita Nyong’o’s (“Star 
Wars: The Last Jedi”) 
performance as Adelaide 
Wilson. Since the film revolves 
around duplicates, she must 
play both herself and her 
sadistic, 
wide-eyed 
double, 
Red. As a result, Nyong’o has 
to be both protective and 
malevolent, 
frightened 
and 
robotic, along with several 
other notable dualities. Her 
ability to carry off what is 
basically twice the burden of 
what a normal role entails is 
purely astounding. Without 
her, 
the 
movie 
probably 
wouldn’t work. Winston Duke, 
(“Black Panther”), on the other 
hand, was the film’s comic 
relief. 
As 
Gabe, 
Adelaide’s 
husband, his corny presence 

gave “Us” an initial levity. 
More importantly, when the 
horror setpieces began, his 
one-liners didn’t take away 
from the tension at hand.
“Get Out” boasted notably 
ominous 
camerawork 
and 
cinematography, 
and 
“Us” 
demonstrates 
Peele 
honing 
these skills. Peele constructs 
nearly every frame with visually 
arresting 
and 
symbolism-
drenched 
composition. 
The 
embryonic 
suggestions 
of 
his ideas manifest with the 
right amount of subtlety, so 
that when they finally reveal 
themselves, it feels like we 
have been thinking about them 
all along. Without getting too 
specific, a hint I have for those 
who haven’t seen the movie: 
Pay attention to what everyone 
is wearing.
Of 
course, 
as 
a 
self-

proclaimed horror nerd, Peele 
references several of the works 
that influenced him, from “A 
Nightmare on Elm Street” to 
“The Shining” to the obscure 
sci-fi flick “C.H.U.D.” To see 
and understand these mini 
love-letters to horror films of 
the past was invigorating to 
me, but Peele does far more 
than repurpose style. It would 
be presumptuous to say that 
Peele 
has 
comprehensively 
realized a style of his own, 
but one is certainly emerging. 
His 
camera 
placement 
is 
uniquely conducive to effective 
jumpscares, and he peppers 
them into the narrative at an 

impressively measured pace. 
He also has an obsession for 
totems of his own mythology, 
from the tea cup in “Get Out” 
to the creepy white rabbits 
and golden scissors that were 
centerpieces 
in 
marketing 
campaign of “Us.”
Michael Abels, composer of 
the music for “Get Out,” outdid 
himself with his second film 
score. Many have heard his 
ominously groovy remix of “I 
Got 5 On It” from the trailers, 
but a larger standout from the 
film is “Anthem,” a primal, 
crescendoing, war-chant that 
is sure to induce nightmares. 
Abels demonstrates a knack 
for 
weaving 
in 
impactful 
leitmotifs 
into 
otherwise 
dissonant 
horror 
sounds, 
going for melody where other 
composers wouldn’t dare.
In all honesty, even though 
I adored so many aspects 
of the film, I didn’t love 
it. Again, it’s impossible 
to be specific as to what 
thematic elements were 
tough 
to 
internalize 
without ruining the entire 
movie, so I’ll say this: 
You have to see “Us” for 
yourself. I can’t understate 
how important it is to see 
the film in theaters, too. 
In my viewing, the crowd 
was utterly cacophonous, 
crying, 
laughing, 

screaming and muttering 
hysterically. Few theater 
experiences 
are 
this 
collectively engaging.
“Us” 
might 
be 
a 
more 
interesting movie to think 
about than it is to see. There 
are details of the script that, 
in reflection, have made me 
rethink about every aspect 
of what I saw, and I’m still 
formulating an understanding 
of the ending. Beyond my 
confusion and my doubt, I’m 
glad “Us” exists and that 
Jordan Peele is making horror 
movies. He clearly wants to 
tackle 
American 
issues 
by 
reframing them and inciting 
discussion about about them. 
And that discussion, in and of 
itself, is a gift.

‘Us’ is an accomplishment, 
if not a stride, for Peele

As a 20-year-old, I haven’t 
opened 
a 
children’s 
book 
since I was a child myself. 
I 
vaguely 
remember 
some 
classics like “The Giving Tree” 
and “Goodnight Moon” that 
formed my reading experience. 
Children’s books are not like 
children’s movies— they’re used 
as tools of literacy. 
They don’t have 
the 
complexity 
of 
movies, 
no 
deeper 
messages 
or 
obscure 
symbols. At least, 
that’s 
what 
I 
had 
assumed. 
But 
despite 
its 
simplicity, “Music 
for Mister Moon” 
still manages to 
convey a message 
that’s relevant to 
all ages.
Harriet 
Henry 
plays 
the 
cello. One day, her parents said, 
“You will play your cello in a 
big orchestra. Won’t that make 
you happy?” Harriet Henry 
had a big imagination. She 
pictured herself on the stage 
with rows and rows of people 
dressed like penguins. See, 
Harriet Henry was like every 
child at the thought of a public 
performance. She had stage 
fright. She told her parents, 
“No, I don’t think that would 
make me happy.”
Harriet Henry did not want to 
play the cello in a big orchestra. 
Harriet Henry wanted to play 
the cello alone.
In the dead quiet of the night, 
Harriet Henry used her big 
imagination to transform her 

little room into a cellist haven, 
decorated 
with 
everything 
from a fireplace to a staple 
teacup. It was the perfect set up 
for Harriet Henry to perform 
in solitude. When a noisy owl 
threatens to disrupt her peace, 
Harriet Henry — naturally — 
becomes very upset. She throws 
the teacup out the window 
and misses (a tragedy that is 
entirely too familiar), knocking 
the moon out of the sky and into 

her chimney instead.
And 
so 
their 
adventure 
begins.
Harriet 
Henry 
showed 
Mister 
Moon 
around 
her 
neighborhood. They stopped 
by the hatmaker for a hat to put 
on Mister Moon’s chilly head. 
They borrowed a boat from the 
fisherman so that Mister Moon 
can float on the lake. These 
interludes are enhanced with 
a sense of magical realism. The 
hatmaker and the fisherman 
are a bear and seal, respectively. 
Their 
exchanges, 
however, 
transcends 
any 
interspecies 
dissonance. 
The 
hatmaker 
and fisherman are humanized 
by 
their 
fond 
memories 
with Mister Moon and their 
altruistic actions.
In her quest to return the 

moon back to its rightful place, 
Mister Moon and Harriet also 
develop a warm friendship. 
When Mister Moon confessed 
his 
regrets 
and 
dreams, 
Harriet, in turn, thought of 
her own wishes and worries. 
Will she be able to muster the 
courage to share her music to 
Mister Moon?
“Music for Mister Moon” 
takes its readers on a fantastical 
journey to reflect on their own 
fears. As Harriet 
Henry and Mister 
move 
from 
one 
scene to the next, 
the readers, too, 
are able to fluidly 
transition 
from 
one notable time 
in their lives to 
the next. Although 
the 
sentences 
are sparse, each 
word 
is 
laden 
with the theme of 
camaraderie 
and 
lost childhood. I was reminded 
of “Up” and “Peter Pan” several 
times while reading.
Erin 
Stead’s 
muted 
watercolor 
illustrations, 
moreover, are perfect for the 
serene atmosphere of “Music 
for 
Mister 
Moon.” 
While 
examining 
the 
pictures, 
I 
almost wanted to curl up in 
my own bed, dreaming of 
orchestras, penguins and an 
enchanting moon. It is a lovely 
children’s book that shows 
that the support of friends 
and family are one of the most 
important tools in conquering 
your 
fears 
and 
expressing 
courage.
The story is moving while 
at the same time relatable for 
all ages, even jaded college 
students, such as myself.

The 
magical 
thing 
about 
Animal 
Collective’s 
co-founding 
member 
Avey 
Tare, also known as David 
Portner, is his ability to make 
the abrasive sound beautiful. 
He can take piercing, droning 
synths fit for an industrial 
show and alter them until 
they are more fit for a relaxing 
summer evening of reflection 
and remembrance. Avey Tare 
showcases this prowess once 
again on his sixth full-length 
release, Cows on 
Hourglass Pond.
Tare kicks off 
the 
album 
with 
the 
remarkably 
abstract 
“What’s 
the 
Goodside.” 
Though a dance-
inspired 
drum 
pattern drives the 
song, 
Tare 
has 
no 
intention 
of 
coaxing 
listeners 
to get up and dance. Instead, 
through 
the 
utilization 
of 
nearly indecipherable lyrics 
and vocals processed with 
effects like distortion, reverb 
and god knows what else, 
he conjures a song that is 
guaranteed to make listeners 
stop what they are doing for 
a chance to decode whatever 
meaning they believe to be 
hidden within the song.
This trend continues and is 
expanded upon as the album 
rolls. Songs like “Nostalgia 
in Lemonade” are not nearly 
as lyrically dense as “What’s 
the Goodside,” but they are 
just as challenging sonically. 
“Nostalgia 
in 
Lemonade” 
is 
simply 
about 
enjoying 

lemonade on a warm day, 
yearning for just one more 
sip long after the drink has 
been finished. Despite this 
straightforward 
message, 
the instrumental is anything 
but simple. It begins with a 
clipping, skipping hum that 
metamorphs into a buzzing 
synthesizer 
burst 
layered 
beneath a glimmering string 
section led by an airy guitar. 
The sheer contrast of these 
sounds is challenging enough, 
but further exacerbated by the 
fact that it is just as gorgeous 
as it is trance-inducing.
If 
the 
electronic 

instrumentals were stripped 
away 
and 
replaced 
by 
something more acoustic and 
folksy, Cows on Hourglass Pond 
would be fit to be performed 
at local folk venue The Ark. 
Each song on the album has 
the ability to call old memories 
to the forefront of listeners’ 
mind and make readers reflect 
on the lyrics, no matter how 
nonpictorial 
they 
may 
be. 
Tare’s 
ability 
to 
combine 
psychedelic folk music with 
the avant garde and create 
something completely new is 
truly a marvel. The album’s 
closing track “HORS_” is the 
ultimate culmination of Tare’s 
skill.
Unlike 
“Nostalgia 
in 

Lemonade” and “Chilly Blue,” 
“HORS_” finds Tare at his 
most subdued musically. Until 
the very end of the song, 
he keeps the instrumental 
relatively simple with a driving 
acoustic guitar, pulsating hand 
claps and chime-like keys, 
instead opting to experiment 
with his voice by messing with 
the elongation of each word 
and raising and lowering his 
voice at whim. The lyrics are 
marked by non sequiturs and 
verge toward the nonsensical, 
described by Tare himself 
as “an ode to horses.” As the 
song continues, all lyrics are 
replaced 
with 
unintelligible 
vocals 
and 
humming 
that 
would 
sound 
right at home on 
Bon Iver’s 22, A 
Million. As soon 
as listeners settle 
into this soothing 
section, the song 
disintegrates into 
static, providing an 
abrupt end to the album.
Avey Tare’s efforts on Cows 
on Hourglass Pond do not 
go unnoticed. He creates an 
atmosphere of curiosity and 
wonder in manner similar to the 
early work of Wallace Stevens, 
specifically 
“Comedian 
as 
the Letter C.” That is to say 
that album does not primarily 
emphasize meaning. The lyrics 
are still important, but they 
are not central to the album, 
which is why they are often 
muddled and processed. Cows 
on Hourglass Pond focuses 
instead 
on 
the 
form 
and 
execution of its sound, so that 
all listeners can find a way to 
relate their own nostalgia and 
memories to each song.

Certain genres of electronic 
music, such as house and 
techno, are ostensibly quite 
limited in their scope. 110-150 
BPM. Four-on-the-floor beats. 
Synthesized basslines. These 
frameworks exist to make 
DJ’s lives easier, allowing 
them to tempo match and 
transition seamlessly between 
songs in their mixes. The last 
thing a DJ wants, after 
all, is a transition that 
makes 
things 
choppy 
and disrupts the flow of 
the party. It takes a truly 
talented 
musician 
to 
reside in this somewhat 
limited framework and be 
creative and innovative 
within it. One of the most 
exciting of these masters 
is South Africa’s Black 
Coffee.
Nkosinathi 
Innocent 
Maphumulo, 
better 
known as Black Coffee, 
was 
born 
in 
Durban, 
South Africa and studied 
music 
at 
the 
Durban 
University of Technology 
before 
launching 
into 
the South African dance 
music scene. He started 
DJing at a very young 
age, 
taking 
influences 
from the local disco and 
popular music coming 
from the townships of 
South Africa. His first 
big break came when 
he was selected as a 
participant in the Red 
Bull Music Academy. Since 
then, he’s only risen upward, 
winning award after award for 
his work and performing with 
Boiler Room, Mixmag, Ultra, 
Sonar and a host of other 
electronic music institutions. 
He sells out shows everywhere 
from Miami to Ibiza, with a 
unique style that has helped 
him stand out from the hordes 
of similar-sounding European 
DJs.
Black 
Coffee’s 
specialty 
house originated in Chicago 
in the early 1980s. Black DJs 
such as Frankie Knuckles used 
new instruments, particularly 

a variety of drum machines 
and synthesizers. They used a 
love for genres, such as disco 
and European dance music, 
to create a genre to be played 
in spaces which expressly 
forbade 
any 
discrimination 
with regards to race, gender, 
sexual orientation, etc.
In an interview with DJ 
Mag, Black Coffee notes, “I 
understood the depth of the 
jazz genre, and on the flipside 
I also understood dance music. 

So I was in a very fortunate 
position. What I wanted to 
do was bridge the gap, and 
with my understanding of 
jazz, be able to simplify it so 
the dance music fan doesn’t 
feel overwhelmed by it.” But 
jazz is far from the only genre 
to influence his mostly deep 
house discography.
In the backdrop of the fall 
of apartheid in the late 1980s 
and early 1990s, a genre called 
kwaito emerged in the Soweto 
township 
of 
Johannesburg. 
Kwaito borrows heavily from 
house, but often slows down 
the beats and incorporates 

elements of disco and R&B as 
well as spoken lyrics.
Watching 
one 
of 
Black 
Coffee’s sets, it’s easy to notice 
he is not a run-of-the-mill DJ. 
Tall and imposing, he is one of 
those DJs who is fully focused 
on the technicalities of his 
craft, preferring to eschew 
frequent crowd interaction. 
His 
mixes 
are 
fluid 
and 
vibrant, with several remix 
tracks of the South African 
canon. 
He 
is 
particularly 
talented 
at 
managing 
the dynamic of the mix, 
pacing his sequence of 
tracks, not only using 
melodic or rhythmic cues 
but also dynamic range 
and character. Even more 
impressively, he does his 
work without the use of 
his left arm, which was 
paralyzed after a car 
accident when he was 
only 14.
Even 
within 
the 
aforementioned 
limited 
house framework, Black 
Coffee innovates. Those 
same 
four-on-the-floor 
breakbeats are infused 
with 
rhythms 
and 
instrumentation from his 
home country’s musical 
tradition. House clichés, 
such as whispery female 
vocals, 
are 
executed 
using 
samples 
from 
South African soul and 
disco 
music 
coming 
from the townships of 
Johannesburg 
and 
his 
hometown, Durban.
Diversity is not quite 
what people associate with 
house these days. But it’s worth 
remembering the origins of the 
genre, and especially now, it’s 
worth getting excited about 
its future. The rise of artists 
such as Black Coffee represent 
a future of house where the 
world’s soundscapes become 
ever more present. The bare 
bones of house will likely 
remain the same, and will 
remain as a canvas for artists 
to paint over. But the sounds 
will hopefully be as varied as 
the people that make them, 
and the parties of the world 
will become a bit richer.

TV REVIEW

Community is a fragile thing, 
often built on fantasy, or a 
promise of a different reality. 
A community is a collection of 
people, some good and some 
bad, who share the goal of 
doing what’s best for their small 
locality. Yet, NBC has crafted 
“The Village”: a show based not 
on the give-and-take of living 
and finding commonality with 
those who are vastly different 
from you, but on the premise of 
interlocking stories as the sole 
basis of a familial relationship.
“The Village” is an almost 
fairytale-like 
apartment 
building in Brooklyn, where 
the colorful residents find not 
just a community, but a family. 
The premiere follows a few 
intertwined 
threads. 
First, 
disabled veteran Nick (Warren 
Christie, 
“The 
Resident”) 
returns home from Iraq, finding 
companionship with some old 
retired soldiers. One of these 

is Enzo (Dominic Chianese, 
“The Sopranos”), who’s escaped 
from his nursing home with his 
son’s credit card. Meanwhile, 
one of Enzo’s nurses — and 
Nick’s old girlfriend 
— Sarah (Michaela 
McManus, 
“Aquarius”) 
struggles to relate 
to 
her 
teenage 
daughter, 
Katie 
(Grace 
Van 
Dien, 
“Charlie 
Says”), 
who 
finds 
out 
she’s 
pregnant. 
Meanwhile, 
when 
Ava (Moran Atias, 
“The 
Resident”), 
an Iranian refugee, 
is apprehended by 
ICE, 
local 
police 
officer, Ben (Jerod 
Haynes, 
debut) 
takes her son in as she is being 
investigated further.
To clear the air, “The Village” 
has been compared to — and for 
good reason — NBC’s emotional 
tour de force, “This Is Us.” 

They share a lot in common: 
interconnected 
stories, 
tearjerker moments and a plot 
built on the struggle of familial 
relationships. That being said, 

“The Village” is absolutely not 
“This Is Us.” It isn’t because the 
story is different, but because 
“The Village” has fundamental 
flaws that stop it from ever 
reaching the emotional gravity 

of “This Is Us.”
First and foremost is the 
very 
strange 
use 
of 
“Talk 
Dirty to Me” by Jason Derulo, 
featuring 
2 
Chainz. 
When 

might this song play during a 
show whose integral drive and 
fuel is its viewer’s tears? When 
three old guys are ogling a yoga 
instructor in the nursing home.
Additionally, 
rather 
than 

crafting 
a 
story 
that 
will 
organically 
offer 
emotional 
gravitas, “The Village” exploits 
elements that will guarantee 
cheap sympathy. Take Nick, 
who represents the 
show’s 
pinch 
of 
token 
patriotism. 
There’s no genuine 
discussion 
of 
the 
horrors 
of 
war 
or 
the 
hidden 
repercussions 
that 
haunt 
the 
minds of veterans 
— something that 
is 
very 
important 
thematically to “This 
Is Us.” Instead, we 
simply receive the 
hollow presence of 
a one-legged vet and 
his 
twin 
German 
Shepherds.
While the show is on the 
verge of a diverse cast, the 
problems are very white, while 
the problems facing minorities 
go mostly overlooked. There’s 
yet to be a discussion of what 

inner conflict Ben must feel 
as a Black cop in gentrified 
Brooklyn. 
Likewise, 
the 
presence 
of 
undocumented 
immigrants are used as a self-
explanatory critique on current 
politics, rather than a genuine 
exploration of what it means to 
be stateless in modern America, 
following a disturbing new 
trend in TV where all immigrant 
characters are undocumented 
and on the verge of deportation.
The 
emphasis 
on 
family 
in “The Village” is awkward 
and misplaced. Not because 
it doesn’t belong, but because 
it feels forced. The show’s 
generally talented cast cannot 
save the story’s inability to 
create 
genuine 
connections 
between the characters. It’s 
very mellow and seeks to score 
easy, 
passionate 
clout 
that 
it really doesn’t deserve. If 
there’s any takeaway from “The 
Village,” it’s that this is not 
what a community is like. It’s 
time to put an end to the “This 
Is Is” counterfeits.

What it’s like to be a female

sports photographer


2B — March 25, 2019
SportsMonday
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

In observance of Women’s His-
tory Month, The Daily’s sports sec-
tion is launching its second annual 
series aimed at telling the stories 
of female ath-
letes, coaches 
and teams at 
the University 
from the per-
spective of the 
female sports 
photographers 
on staff. We 
continue the 
series with this 
story from the 
2018 Manag-
ing Photo Edi-
tors Katelyn 
Mulcahy and 
Alexis Rankin.
A

n old 
issue 
of The 
Daily hangs 
in the photo 
closet. Every 
time a Daily 
photographer walks into the 
closet to check out equipment to 
shoot, they are reminded of its 
presence.
On it, there is a photo of Sara 
Krulwich on the sideline in the 
Big House, with two of her foot-
ball photos included.
Krulwich was the Daily’s first 
female photographer in 1969, and 
that photo captures her during 
her first time on the field, as the 
first woman to do so. Standing 
there smiling and proud, she 
encourages us every time we go 
out to shoot, knowing that we’re 
following the trail she blazed for 
us.
As Managing Photo Editors 
in 2018, we both came into the 
job with different experience 
levels and different goals with 
sports photography. Katelyn, who 
will be working for the Houston 
Astros as their live content cre-
ator after graduation, knew that 
she wanted to pursue sports pho-
tography from the start. At first, 
Alexis didn’t even know if she 
wanted to shoot sports at all. But 
now as a second-year MPE, she 
has had the opportunity to shoot 

at countless basketball, hockey 
and football games with the 
intention, and desire, to do more.
It’s an intimidating experi-
ence to photograph sports, espe-
cially “the Big Three”: football, 
basketball and hockey. It’s even 
more intimidating for a woman 
working for a student paper with 
minimal experience. But like the 
writers on the Sports section and 
the rest of The Michigan Daily 
staff, we take the job as seriously 
as any other professional. Because 
that is what we are — profession-
als in our craft.
Since we both started at The 
Michigan Daily, we’ve practiced 
and learned from each other’s 
confidence, experience and sup-
port. We didn’t always consider 
ourselves sports photographers, 
and many other people still don’t. 
But when we step onto the court 
at Crisler Center, walk through 
the tunnel leading into the Big 
House, or take a seat at a photo 
hole against the glass at Yost 
Arena, that is exactly what we 
are. 
When either of us sets up our 
laptop and unpacks our equip-
ment in the media room, we have 
to believe that we deserve to be 
in that room as much as any of 
the other photographers there, 
because if we don’t believe it, they 
never will.
It’s telling that no matter our 
amount of experience, sometimes 
we still get treated as if we have 
none. So, when we step out onto 
the field, the court or the ice, it’s 
easy to feel small.
The job is strenuous. We carry 
two, sometimes three cameras, 
that make our arms sore the next 
day. We stand, kneel and crouch 
through rain, snow and freezing 
temperatures. We dodge foot-
ball players that run off the field 
and basketballs that come flying 
toward us, and keep our cameras 
focused on the action when two 
hockey players slam into the glass 
in front of us. It’s stressful and 
intense, but we never complain. 
It’s part of the job and we love it. 
We barely even notice anymore.
But everyone else seems to 

think we do.
It sometimes feels like we’re at 
a disadvantage right as we step in 
the room. When one of us goes to 
an event, the event staff is often 
unintentionally condescending. 
Like when one of us was in an 
elevator and someone referred to 
us as “sweetie.” In an elevator full 
of men, it served as a reminder of 
who we are in a male-dominated 
profession. He didn’t mean ill by 
it, and neither do the people who 
make comments about our cam-
eras being bigger than us or other 
similar remarks, but they are all 
reminders of how we are viewed 
differently as young women in 
this profession.
But the people who’ve told us 
we’re “overcompensating” by 
having two cameras or a 300mm 
lens don’t mean well. It some-
times feels the same way with 
the overly helpful male photog-
raphers who stand behind our 
computers while we’re ingesting 

photos, giving unsolicited advice 
and comments. We’ve had men 
take photos of us while we’re busy 
shooting, only for them to show 
us later and comment on what 
we’re doing or the way we look. 
We hear these comments and 
have these experiences almost 
every time we shoot, and while 
it’s frustrating, it also makes us 
work harder. We know we don’t 
need to prove ourselves to the boy 
making snide comments from the 
student section — who has proba-
bly never picked up a DSLR in his 
life — or to the sideline photogra-
pher who thinks we can’t handle 
our equipment.
While the negative experiences 
sometimes outweigh the positive 
ones, it’s important to recognize 
the support we’ve received as 
well. Many of the photographers 
we’ve met at games have wel-
comed us, anything from chatting 
during a media timeout to giv-
ing us freelance tips. Sometimes 

something as simple as a com-
ment, like or retweet of our pho-
tos online goes a long way.
Our sports writers are equally 
as supportive, retweeting our 
content and texting us to tell us 
how much they liked our pho-
tos. And we find allies in the 
other women out there with us, 
whether it’s another Daily staff 
photographer, an editor from the 
Michiganensian or one of the few 
experienced, professional women 
photographers.
The encouragement we receive 
makes up for the microaggres-
sions and outright insults that we 
sometimes experience. We knew 
going into sports photography 
that it would be difficult. We 
heard stories from editors and 
photographers before us about 
the comments they received 
while shooting. For example, a 
former MPE was told, “You’re 
only here to get closer to the bas-
ketball boys, right?”

Wrong.
He said it with a laugh, prob-
ably thinking it was funny, but it 
was a comment that lingered and 
was passed down to us as manag-
ing editors. So while we appreci-
ate the support and advice we’ve 
received from some of the other 
photographers, we know that we 
have to work twice as hard every 
time we shoot. Every time we 
pick up a camera, we are build-
ing a reputation for ourselves and 
for the other women on our staff, 
as talented, dedicated photogra-
phers.
We’ve come a long way since 
Krulwich stepped out onto the 
field as the first female photog-
rapher to do so. Stories like hers 
push us to keep going. That’s why 
we’re proud to be women on the 
sideline, to even out that imbal-
ance. To show the girls in the 
crowd that they could be us some-
day, too, just like Sara Krulwich 
did for us.

Road crowd and slow start lead to 
season-ending loss for Wolverines

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — It was 
never going to be easy.
Playing in front of a crowd 
of 7,725, the Michigan women’s 
basketball 
team 
knew 
that 
it would be a daunting order 
to 
defeat 
the 
top-seeded 
Louisville Cardinals, who boast 
one of the best home-court 
advantages in all of college 
basketball. 
The 
Wolverines 
even tried to replicate the 
raucous environment of the 
KFC Yum! Center before the 
game. 
“We 
practiced 
yesterday 
with a speaker and a lot of loud 
noises,” said senior forward 
Hallie Thome.
And yet, despite its prep, 
Michigan was blitzed out of 
the gate. National Player of 
the Year candidate Asia Durr 
scored 12 quick points, and the 
Wolverines found themselves 
in a 19-4 hole before the game’s 
first media timeout. With each 
basket, the Cardinals’ lead — 
and cheers — only grew.
Before 
the 
season 
even 
began, Michigan head coach 
Kim Barnes Arico made a 
point to schedule tough non-
conference road games in order 
to prepare her squad for the 
road environments it could face 
if it earned a spot in the NCAA 
Tournament.
“We’ve 
tested 
ourselves 
against the best teams in 
the country in hopes for an 
opportunity like we’re going to 
have tomorrow,” Barnes Arico 
said in a press conference on 
Saturday.
While Michigan had played 
against hostile road crowds, 
nothing came close to the 
atmosphere that the Wolverines 
were faced with on Sunday 
afternoon. The crowd’s sheer 
volume sounded like it could 
have easily been ripped from a 
sold-out football stadium.
“We just got shook and 
rattled,” Barnes Arico said, “It 
took us a few minutes to get out 

of that.”
While the Cardinals thrived 
off of the crowd’s energy, 
it ended up serving as the 
catalyst for the Wolverines’ 
undoing. The team committed 
five turnovers by the time the 
first media timeout hit, and 
struggled to find any offensive 
rhythm against 
Louisville’s 
daunting 
press. 
The 
Wolverines, 
who had used 
the 
press 
to 
spearhead 
its 
dominant 
84-54 win over 
Kansas 
State 
just two days 
prior, 
now 
found its own weapon being 
used against it.
Though Michigan eventually 
settled 
down, 
cutting 
Louisville’s lead to 21-15 with 
eight minutes remaining in the 
first half, turnover struggles — 
it finished with 17 in the first 
half alone — prevented it from 
further attempts at a comeback. 
Once again, the crowd helped 
play a major role.
“We couldn’t hear … our 
defensive switches or offensive 
plays or things like that,” 
said junior guard Akienreh 
Johnson.

Despite 
the 
loss, 
there 
is still plenty of room for 
optimism as the book closes 
on the Wolverines’ 2018-19 
campaign. Though Michigan 
will lose Thome and senior 
forward Nicole Munger, the 
team will return several of its 
key 
contributors, 
including 
freshman 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon 
and 
guard Amy Dilk.
“I’m sure that 
they’re going to 
watch that film 
and learn from 
that experience 
so they are never 
in that position 
again,” 
Barnes 
Arico said.
Even in a loss where it may be 
difficult to find a silver lining, 
the Wolverines showed fight 
against one of the toughest 
home crowds the sport has to 
offer. Barnes Arico, despite 
another 
second-round 
loss, 
says her team will enter the 
offseason with its heads held 
high.
“We have a great basketball 
team,” Barnes Arico said. “Just 
going up against one of the 
top teams in the country on 
their home court is tough and 
Louisville was great tonight for 
sure.”

Michigan bows out of Tournament 
with 71-50 loss against Louisville

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — From the 
tip, the game followed a frenetic 
pace. Egged on by a sea of red, the 
top-seeded Cardinals jumped 
out to a quick start.
The crowd was raucous to 
begin with, but a 3-pointer 
and 
breakaway 
layup 
from 
Louisville’s All-American guard 
Asia Durr put it into a full-out 
frenzy.
After just three minutes of 
play, Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico had already called timeout 
in an attempt to calm her team 
nerves after falling behind 10-2.
Though those nerves calmed 
eventually, 
the 
Michigan 
women’s basketball team (22-
12) had already dug itself a hole 
against 
the 
Cardinals 
(31-3) 
that it couldn’t climb out of, 
eventually losing 71-50.
The 
Wolverines’ 
offense 
looked completely out of sorts 
early. 
Louisville’s 
pressure 
defense 
overwhelmed 
Michigan’s 
ball-handlers, 
leading to five turnovers within 
the first five minutes of the game.
“They sped us up a lot,” said 
junior guard Akienreh Johnson. 
“That was their game plan. They 
like to take away the point guard 
because it messes up everything 
on offense. I don’t think they 
did anything different against 
us, but they definitely brought 
a lot of intensity the first couple 
minutes of the game.”
The turnovers led to offensive 
opportunities, 
especially 
for 
Durr, who went 3-of-5 from 
beyond the arc in the first quarter 
— including a four-point play.
“I don’t think we did a good 
job on Durr initially,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Anytime a great 
player gets going early, you know 
you’re trouble. Once you get some 
open looks and you get them to 
fall, holy cow and that happened 
with her. They did a tremendous 
job finding her early.”
With the help of their full-
court press, the Wolverines 
did settle in towards the end 

of the quarter. Off an inbounds 
play, Michigan’s freshmen duo 
connected for two as point 
guard Amy Dilk lofted the ball to 
forward Naz Hillmon.
Louisville’s 
stellar 
3-point 
shooting also subsided as the 
quarter went on. Even still, the 
Cardinals led the Wolverines by 
eight after 10 minutes.
The pace continued into the 
second frame. Dilk answered a 
tough fadeaway from Durr with 
a contested layup over 6-foot-4 
forward Kylee Shook.
Louisville’s 
offense 
methodically worked through 
Michigan’s 
press. 
In 
one 
sequence, Durr caught in mid-
air 
between 
two 
Wolverine 
defenders made a no-look pass 
to a cutting Jazmine Jones, who 
finished the layup with ease.
Michigan 
was 
made 
to 
continually climb out of a hole. 
Every time the Wolverines had a 
productive offensive possession, 
they gave up two on the other 
end.
In 
many 
ways, 
Michigan 
was lucky to trail by just 12 
points entering the halftime 
break — given a season-high 17 
turnovers and a potent offensive 
performance from the Cardinals.
The Wolverines cleaned up 
their turnover issues in the third 
quarter. Dilk and sophomore 
guard Deja Church handled the 
Louisville press more efficiently 
and 
yet, 
Michigan 
couldn’t 
outpace the Cardinals’ offense.
Durr continued to orchestrate 
their offense to perfection — 
hitting difficult jumpers and 
sharing the ball when necessary. 
Jones also provided a spark for 
Louisville with six third-quarter 
points.
“(Durr’s) an All-American, but 
she is also the kind of kid that let’s 
the game come to her,” Barnes 
Arico said. “She doesn’t press too 
much. She did a tremendous job 
for them tonight.”
Though 
not 
induced 
by 
turnovers, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
empty possessions cost them. 
Consecutive over-the-top dishes 
from Jones to her bigs and 

another three-pointer from Durr 
increased Michigan’s deficit to 
23 entering the final quarter.
Rebounding 
had 
been 
a 
strength 
of 
the 
Wolverines 
throughout 
the 
year 
and 
particularly in their first-round 
game against Kansas State — 
when they out-rebounded the 
Wildcats 50-19. That disparity 
was nowhere to be seen against 
the Cardinals, who managed to 
outdo Michigan on the glass.
“Everybody started to get into 
the mix,” said Louisville coach 
Jeff Walz. “We had talked to 
the guards and said ‘You’ve got 
to rebound the basketball.’ One 
thing we told our kids, whoever 
was guarding Hillmon, ‘I don’t 
care if you get a rebound, she 
can’t.’ ”
The Wolverines did what 
they could to chip away. In what 
ended up being her final game, 
senior guard Nicole Munger, 
as she has done so many times 
before, hit a three-pointer from 
the wing. On a fastbreak, she 
then found senior center Hallie 
Thome for two points to briefly 
cut the lead to 18.
Unfortunately for Michigan, 
this 
run 
was 
short-lived. 
Louisville was one step ahead 
of the Wolverines and exploited 
any holes in their defense. Durr 
— who finished with 24 points 
— hit her fifth three-pointer to 
officially put the game out of 
reach.
As the seconds ticked away 
on 
Michigan’s 
season, 
the 
Cardinals emptied their bench, 
replacing key contributors Durr 
and Jones to standing ovations 
from the 8,000 Louisville fans in 
attendance.
On the other side, Munger and 
Thome trotted off the court for 
the final time in their impressive 
careers as Wolverines.
“I think a lot of people doubted 
us this year with losing Katelynn 
Flaherty,” Thome said. “But we 
proved so many people wrong. I 
definitely wouldn’t have traded 
it for the world to have gone 
through Michigan. I’m excited to 
see them only get better.”

Ben Mason’s viability through versatility

Steve 
George 
paused 
long 
enough to make it clear he rejected 
the very premise of the question.
George 
coached 
now-
Michigan sophomore Ben Mason 
at Newtown High School. He 
granted Mason free reign to 
traverse the field at just about 
every position from wide receiver 
to running back, linebacker to 
defensive line. You name it, Mason 
did it. He watched Mason set the 
Connecticut state record for pick-
sixes.
So, 
asked 
last 
November 
whether perhaps Mason would 
have thrived at linebacker in a 
different era — in a bygone time 
where 
downhill, 
run-stopping 
linebackers were in vogue — 
George made his feelings known. 
Time period be damned.
“I mean, I don’t even know 
in a different era,” George said. 
“I think this era would be no 
different.”
At the time, Mason was in the 
midst of a breakout campaign 
at fullback, and the idea that 
a different position might suit 
him better seemed outlandish. 
The 
sophomore 
had 
tallied 
six touchdowns in just five 
weeks. He was emerging as 
a reliable staple of an offense 
with 
otherwise 
maddening 
inconsistency. 
His 
persona 
defined by brute physicality was 
increasingly endearing him to 
fans, who regularly greeted his 
presence on the field with hymns 
of excitement. In his own way, 
Mason was emerging as a star.
Fast forward four months and 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
is talking about Mason moving 
around positions, not as any sort 
of demotion, but rather quite the 
opposite. Harbaugh said last week 
he wants to get Mason on the field 
for 60 to 70 plays per game, rather 
than the roughly 20 to 25 he played 
last season. To do so, he’ll be 
operating all over the field rather 
than primarily at fullback. In his 

answer, Harbaugh listed running 
back, 
fullback, 
3-technique, 
linebacker, tight end and multiple 
special teams positions. And even 
that seemed more like an off-
the-cuff hypothetical than any 
exhaustive list.
Spotting Mason on the field 
next year will seemingly become 
a task akin to solving a Where’s 
Waldo puzzle.
“One day he’s on defense, the 
next day he’s on offense, the next 
day he’ll go to defense and so on, 
and rotate,” Harbaugh said. “… 
It’ll be a lot on his plate, we’ll see 
how he can handle it. I think he’s 
going to handle it really well.”
Harbaugh isn’t alone in holding 
that sentiment. Ask anyone about 
Mason’s skill set and there is a 
remarkably consistent trope.
“You can put him anywhere 
and he can work his tail off,” said 
junior VIPER Khaleke Hudson. 
“Anywhere he ends up, I feel like 
he’ll be great for the team and do 
his position really well.” 
New 
defensive 
line 
coach 
Shaun Nua added that Mason is 
“mentally tough, and (has) enough 
athletic ability to help us out on 
D-Line.” 

According to Harbaugh, Mason 
“could be a little bit undersized as 
an inside 3-technique. But with 
his speed and quickness, I don’t 
know who’s going to stop him.” 
Mason 
came 
to 
Michigan 
hoping 
 
to contribute as a linebacker in 
Don Brown’s aggressive scheme. 
In a conversation with The Daily 
last November, he attempted to list 
all the positions he had previously 
played and/or hoped to play — and 
struggled to do so. 
And yet, the staff’s decision 
begs the question of whether 
plugging Mason all over the 
field truly maximizes his value, 
or simply alleviates some depth 
concerns. At 3-technique, for 
example, Michigan lost Lawrence 
Marshall, Bryan Mone and Aubrey 
Solomon, who, it should be noted, 
weigh an average of 48 pounds 
more than Mason. At linebacker, 
the Wolverines lost Devin Bush, 
and are looking to a relatively 
inexperienced group to fill the 
massive void.
All 
the 
while, 
there’s 
uncertainty as to how actively new 
offensive coordinator Josh Gattis 
will deploy a fullback relative to 
Mason’s prior two seasons on 

the team. Harbaugh voluntarily 
hinted the fullback position will 
de-emphasized — “used in short 
yardage and goal line situations 
predominantly” — as Gattis’ “Pro 
Spread” offense begins to take 
shape. Trying to shoehorn two-
back sets into a spread offense 
creates a square-peg, round-hole 
predicament.
Perhaps trying to theorize 
specifically how Mason will fit into 
the equation next season belies the 
point Harbaugh is making. When 
Harbaugh first called Mason 
after the spring of 2016 to ask 
what he thought about a move to 
fullback, Mason’s response was 
unequivocal.
“I said that I would do anything 
for the team and that I was excited 
to do it,” Mason recalled. “… I 
wanted to come in and make an 
impact no matter how I could do it 
— and I was going to find a way no 
matter what to come in and make 
an impact.”
That, above all else, is what 
defines him.
And as everything else changes 
around 
Ben 
Mason’s 
unique 
Michigan career, it appears that 
never will.

Wolverines complete 
sweep of Cornhuskers

What used to be Michigan’s 
kryptonite turned into its friend 
Sunday.
Senior 
outfielder 
Natalie 
Peters stepped up to bat with 
two outs and the bases loaded 
during the bottom of the second 
inning. But rather than leaving 
runners stranded on base like 
the Wolverines often do, Peters 
pounded a bases-clearing double 
to left field and drove in the 
first three runs that kickstarted 
Michigan’s 12-0 onslaught of the 
Nebraska Cornhuskers.
After a four-run second inning, 
the Wolverines showcased their 
power in the third. 
Senior 
designated 
hitter 
Mackenzie Nemitz led off the 
inning with a solo home run as 
Michigan 
celebrated 
“Kenzie 
Nemitz Day” at Alumni Field. 
“I was rounding third and 
I was like, ‘Please don’t wake 
up,’ because I thought it was a 
dream,” Nemitz said about the 
home run. “As I was rounding 
third and running into my team, 
I was like ‘This is real.’”
Right after her was junior 
third baseman Madison Uden 
who drove another home run 
to center field, her first of the 
year after going without a hit in 
Saturday’s game. 
But the Wolverines didn’t 
stop there. Senior outfielder 
Haley Hoogenraad made it three 
consecutive solo home runs for 
Michigan when she drove her 
first of the season as well down 
the left field line, putting the 
Wolverines up 7-0 after three 
innings.
“In each of the games (this 
series), it took us a while to get 
our timing,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “When we found 
our process, especially today, I 
felt that we had a lot of better 
at-bats and we connected.

“I say it every time. Hitting 
is contagious and if you get a 
few, then people feel looser and 
more confident… Our kids were 
definitely loose and having fun 
today.”
Michigan continued to step on 
the gas pedal during the bottom 
of the fourth inning, determined 
to finish the game on the five-
inning mercy rule.
Loading 
the 
bases 
with 
runners throughout the inning, 
Michigan found stability from 
the middle of its lineup as 
Nemitz, Uden, and Hoogenraad 
each had at least one run batted 
in, extending the lead up to 11.
Hutchins then decided to 
unleash the rest of her weapons, 
giving playing time to many of the 
bench players including junior 
catcher Abby Skvarce who added 
another RBI to her campaign. 
In the meantime, sophomore 
left-hander Meghan Beaubien 
continued her dominance of 
the Cornhuskers, pitching a 
perfect game going into the final 
inning. However, with two outs 
remaining, Beaubien gave up a 
double to Lindsey Walljasper, 
the other starting pitcher today. 
Beaubien 
still 
finished 
with 
seven strikeouts and no walks, 
completing the sweep of the 
Cornhuskers.
“I mean, (Beaubien) keeps 
us in the game,” Nemitz said. 
“We just have to produce for her 
so that’s what we did, and she 
owned it out there.”
Added Beaubien: “It was just a 
lot of fun. I think our dugout was 
having a lot of fun and we were 
hitting the ball really well and 
that kind of energy is contagious.”
With a seven-game winning 
streak and a perfect start to 
the young Big Ten season, 
the Wolverines seem to have 
found some momentum and 
quite possibly its identity, both 
offensively and defensively.

Wolverines’ lack of consistency proves costly

Over the course of Michigan’s 
young baseball season, junior 
left-hander Tommy Henry has 
established himself as the ace of 
the Wolverines’ rotation. He went 
undefeated over his first five starts, 
allowing just two runs to cross the 
plate over those 35 innings, both to 
No. 1 UCLA. He still came out of the 
day with a win, as the Wolverines 
went on to defeat the Bruins, 7-5.
Thursday, 
however, 
was 
a 
different story. Despite not allowing 
a single earned run, Henry took his 
first loss decision as the Wolverines 
fell to No. 19 Texas Tech, 11-2, in 
the first contest of a mistake-laden 
three-game series for Michigan 
this weekend.
Against some of their toughest 
competition of the season so far, 
the 23rd-ranked Wolverines could 
not find a rhythm, as the Red 
Raiders took all three games of 
the series. Though a 16-6 win over 
Stetson on Saturday night was a 
bright spot on the weekend, Texas 
Tech overpowered the Wolverines 
across the board in every contest 
this weekend.

“Texas Tech is just better than 
we are, and they outplayed us all 
weekend long,” Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich said. “They were better 
than us in all the phases of the game 
– offensively, defensively, on the 
mound and in the bullpen. They’re 
an elite program, and they’re the 
best team and the most complete 
team not only that we’ve seen this 
season, but one of the best teams 
I’ve seen in a long, long time.”
The beginning of Thursday’s 
game 
was 
a 
pitcher’s 
duel 
between Henry and Red Raiders 
right-hander Micah Dallas. The 
Wolverines put a run on the board 
in the top of the fourth inning, but 
Texas Tech answered by breaking 
the game open with six runs in the 
bottom of the fifth inning. They 
added a run in both the sixth and 
seventh innings and tacked on 
three more in the eighth en route to 
a comfortable victory.
Friday was more of the same. 
The Red Raiders were on the board 
first with a run in the first inning, 
but Michigan answered with runs 
in the fourth and fifth innings to 
jump out to a one-run lead. But 
fielding woes for the Wolverines 
helped Texas Tech to a five-run 

sixth inning. The Red Raiders went 
on to add three more in the seventh, 
and though the Wolverines were 
able to score a run in the eighth 
inning to bring the score to 10-3, 
they could not manage a comeback.
Michigan showed some fight in 
their first game on Saturday, the 
conclusion of the Texas Tech series. 
Though the Red Raiders were 
again the first to put a run on the 
board, the Wolverines answered 
with a four-run third inning to take 
the lead. The Red Raiders kept the 
game close, though, scoring two 
runs of their own in the bottom of 
the third. They later tied it, tacking 
on another run in the fourth. Both 
teams added a run in the fifth 
inning. But Texas Tech grabbed the 
lead with two runs in the seventh 
inning. And when they added 
another in the eighth off freshman 
right-hander Willie Weiss to bring 
the score to 8-5, Michigan could 
not come up with an answer.
“We couldn’t hold them down 
in the bullpen,” Bakich said. “They 
sped the game up on us defensively. 
They ran out one mid-to-upper-
nineties pitcher after another. And 
we weren’t able to handle it as well 
as we would’ve liked to. They were 

just better. We can’t make any 
excuses for that.”
The Wolverines flipped the 
script in Saturday’s second game, 
when they beat Stetson, 16-6. 
Every Michigan starter had at 
least one hit, including one home 
run from sophomore outfielder 
Jesse Franklin and two from 
junior outfielder Jordan Brewer. 
Michigan’s offense showed its 
explosive potential in the game – 
they had two four-run innings and 
a three-run inning. Still, though, 
its lack of offensive consistency 
coupled 
with 
defensive 
woes 
against 
an 
extremely-capable 
Red Raider offense led to a 
disappointing Texas swing for the 
Wolverines. 
“Growth is a big part of who 
we are as a program,” Bakich 
said. “I haven’t lost a single ounce 
of confidence in our team, and 
in what kind of team that we’re 
going to have this year. We’re on 
the right track. They’re ahead of 
us right now, but we’re getting 
there. I’m glad that we had this 
type of weekend now instead of in 
a regional where our season would 
be over. This was a very beneficial 
trip for us.”

‘M’ earns sixth-straight 
Big Ten Championship

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
gymnastics team has dominated the 
Big Ten in women’s gymnastics this 
year, going 9-0 against conference 
opponents. On Saturday, it was more 
of the same. 
The Wolverines capped off a 
successful year of conference play 
with a strong performance at the Big 
Ten Championships at Rec Hall in 
State College. They came away with 
two gymnasts tied for the all-around 
award as well as the program’s sixth 
consecutive Big Ten trophy.
“It’s awesome,” said Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki. “There’s been a lot 
going on and this team has refused 
to let anything get in the way of their 
goals and they’ve overcome a lot.”
The two Michigan gymnasts 
tied for the all-around award were 
freshman Natalie Wojcik and senior 
Olivia Karas. They each scored a 
total 39.600, and they also shared 
the award with Minnesota’s Lexy 
Ramler.
Karas 
and 
Wojcik’s 
scores, 
combined with the rest of the team’s 
performances, gave the Wolverines 
their total score of 197.400, nearly 
a full point ahead of second place 
Illinois.
Michigan started the meet on 
the balance beam. Though it’s one of 
the more difficult events to get high 
scores, the Wolverines led the meet 
with a combined score of 49.300 at 
the end of the first session.
Wojcik and Karas tied for the 
high score, each earning a 9.900. 
They were followed by sophomore 
Lauren 
Farley 
with 
a 
9.875, 
freshman Maddie Mariani with a 
9.825, as well as juniors Lexi Funk 
and Maddy Osman, who both had 
scores of 9.800. The team had a bye 
for the next event and took a break 
while other teams began with their 
respective events.
Soon enough, the Wolverines 
were back in action on the floor 
exercise.
On floor, Wojcik had the high 
score for the team with an impressive 
9.950. She was followed by Karas 
with a 9.925 and senior Emma 

McLean with a 9.900. McLean and 
Karas are the sole seniors on the 
squad, and there was no better way 
to end their Big Ten careers than 
with a championship.
“I am speechless,” McLean said. 
“I am so proud of my teammates and 
the battles we’ve overcome, and we 
stuck together through all of it. We 
really just gave it everything we had 
from the fall to now and no matter 
what we kept pounding.”
Michigan was rounded out in 
scoring by freshmen Abby Brenner 
and Abby Heiskell, with scores 
of 9.850 and 9.825, respectively. 
Brenner and Heiskell, along with 
Wojcik and Mariani, were integral 
to the team throughout the season 
and have high expectations for the 
coming years.
The team was on vault next, 
where Wojcik had earned a perfect 
score of 10 earlier in February. There 
was no perfect score Saturday, but 
the Wolverines still had the highest 
vault scores of the meet. McLean 
had the high score of the event with 
a 9.900.
Wojcik and Karas each had a 
9.875. Brenner earned herself a 
9.825 and they were rounded out 
by Heiskell and sophomore Anne 
Maxim, each with a score of 9.800.
The final event of the meet for 
Michigan was the uneven bars. 
Brenner and Karas had the high 
scores of 9.900. Mariani and Wojcik 
each had a score of 9.875, and 
Maxim and Heiskell both earned 
a 9.825. With the conclusion of the 
uneven bars, the scores were added 
and the Wolverines were crowned 
champions.
The Big Ten Championship isn’t 
the end for Michigan, though.
“I think we can build on our 
momentum 
(into 
the 
NCAA 
championship) we’ve been creating 
all season,” said McLean. “We’re 
still climbing uphill and we haven’t 
reached our best yet. That’s what 
we’re looking for and hopefully, 
we put it together at the right time. 
I know we will. I know there’s 
exciting things waiting for us.”

Wolverines posterize Gators in win

DES MOINES, Iowa — Isaiah 
Livers didn’t know the ball went 
in until he saw walk-on guard 
Luke Wilson gesturing excitedly 
on the sidelines, until he saw 
his brother and his brother’s 
girlfriend standing up to applaud 
in the audience.
The sophomore forward had 
just received an outlet pass from 
junior guard Zavier Simpson, 
driven to the basket, elevated 
a few feet from the basket and 
thrown down a two-handed slam 
that put Florida guard Andrew 
Nembhard on a poster.
“Oof,” Wilson said later. “Oof. 
I mean, oof.”
Two possessions later, Livers 
did it again, driving into the paint 
and dunking, as if there were 
nothing to it.
But 
there 
wasn’t 
always 
nothing to it. Livers has struggled 
with aggression and on-court 
selflessness since his days as a 
high school point guard, where 
he distributed but didn’t always 
shoot. Coming into college, he 
was stunned at his coaches’ 
advice to be more aggressive and 
in his sophomore year, it’s still a 

process.
Earlier in the game, Livers 
had come out, frustrated that his 
shots weren’t going in. But he had 
been settling for low probability 
mid-range jumpers instead of 
taking his opportunities to turn 
the corner, go downhill and drive.
“Stay aggressive,” assistant 
coaches DeAndre Haynes and 
Saddi Washington told him, 
according to Haynes. “Keep your 
head up, don’t carry suitcases 
right now, you’re gonna get in and 
have a really big game.”
Livers saw the advice as them 
ripping on him. It only made him 
angrier.
“OK,” he said. “Imma show 
you aggressive.”
Now, the only suitcases he’ll 
be carrying are those he packed 
for Anaheim, Calif. on the way 
to the Sweet Sixteen after the 
Wolverines’ 64-49 win over 
Florida.
But 
Nembhard 
wasn’t 
the only one posterized on 
Saturday. 
Freshman 
forward 
Ignas Brazdeikis set the tone on 
Michigan’s very first possession 
of the game. He drove baseline, 
leaving the Gators befuddled, 
and slammed. Junior center Jon 
Teske got the ball from Simpson 

on the next possession and he, 
too, drove into the paint and 
found nothing but rim. And that 
was only his first dunk of the 
night — a minute later, he did it 
again.
“You forget all about those,” 
Livers 
said. 
“It 
was 
just 
aggressiveness. 
Iggy 
ripped 
baseline. 
I 
think 
the 
guy 
overplayed him because Iggy, 
lefty, baseline with his right, one 
up and two, and that’s how you 
start a game off right. And Jon? 
Jon’s seven foot, he doesn’t count. 
He’s gonna go up there and just 
dunk it easy.”
Redshirt junior wing Charles 
Matthews, meanwhile, dunked 
with three minutes left in the 
first half, back when the score 
was still close, giving Michigan 
a three-point cushion. And with 
49 seconds left in the game, 
Matthews threw down another 
dunk, complete with a death 
stare, to put the finishing touches 
on the win.
Fresh off the rush of jumping 
off the bench, again, to celebrate, 
the bench players came in to ice 
the game.
“It gets contagious after a 
while,” Washington said.
The dunks — particularly 
Livers’ — got the whole team 
rolling with a ferocity it hadn’t 
had before, when the Wolverines 
went seven minutes without a 
field goal and let the Gators back 
in the game partway through 
the second half. Afterward, they 
played like the game, and the 
Sweet Sixteen trip, was theirs for 
the taking.
A good 30 minutes after the 
last dunks had landed, the players 
still remembered them in the 
locker room, responding with a 
chorus of “ooohs” and “oofs” and 
speechless head-shakes.
The only person who was 
nonchalant was Michigan coach 
John Beilein, who saw the dunks 
not as a show, but as just another 
piece of a win.
“Two points,” he said when 
asked his reaction. “Way to go, 
man. Get back on defense.”

‘M’ tops Florida, 64-49, advances 
to third consecutive Sweet Sixteen

DES MOINES, Iowa — As 
Michigan entered the halftime 
locker room with a tenuous four-
point lead, John Beilein did not 
look like the coach of a team just 
20 minutes away from its third 
consecutive Sweet Sixteen.
When Jordan Poole sent the 
Wolverines into halftime by firing 
up a contested three, all Beilein 
could do was turn to his bench 
— but no one in particular — and 
offer up a look of confusion. At the 
time, it was justified. Michigan 
(30-6 overall) had shot 13-for-30 
from the field and 4-for-13 from 
three, allowing No. 10-seed Florida 
(20-16) to remain within striking 
distance.
But as Beilein walked into 
the locker room, he carried an 
air 
of 
positivity, 
sandwiching 
each 
criticism 
with 
positive 
reinforcement. And when he and 
the Wolverines returned an hour 
later, where there had been an 
intense half-time team talk, whoops 
and hollers filled the air, spilling 
over from a celebratory shower 
room after No. 2 Michigan’s 64-49 
win over the Gators.
“We should be measured by a lot 
of things,” Beilein said. “This is one 
of them — did we get in the NCAA 
Tournament and then did we 
advance in the NCAA Tournament? 
That’s what my measuring stick 
will always be.”
Amid the celebratory postgame, 
the Wolverines harkened back to 
their halftime adjustments. Beilein 
praised his assistants. Assistant 
coach Luke Yaklich focused on the 
defensive resiliency. Sophomore 
forward CJ Baird credited the 
positivity Beilein instills.
Whatever the conclusion, the 
results were obvious.
As freshman forward Ignas 
Brazdeikis fired up a three on the 
Wolverines’ first possession out of 
the break, it momentarily looked as 
if the second half would mirror the 
first. His shot clanged off the back 

of the rim, then the front, before 
popping above the basket as the 
heavily maize-and-blue clad crowd 
let out a collective sigh.
Then, the ball magically dropped 
back through the hoop, turning 
that sigh into a raucous ovation. 
With the ovation came a return of 
Michigan’s swagger.
“At first I thought it was good, 
but once it stopped bouncing 
around the rim, I was like, ‘Oh no, 
this might miss.’ And then I hit it 
so that was a bit of a relief for me,” 
Brazdeikis said. “… It definitely 
helped our rhythm for sure. 
Coming out of the half and scoring 
a big three is always huge.”
That swagger manifested as 
junior center Jon Teske followed 
the three by finding his way into 
the paint for a layup. Then, Poole 
finished through contact and buried 
the ensuing free throw, sending the 
Wolverines’ bench onto their feet. 
When Poole hit a step-back three 
30 seconds later, Michigan’s once 
fragile lead had grown to 15 on the 
back of an 11-0 run.
The Gators’ resiliency, though, 
didn’t end there.
They drew back within six with a 
9-0 run of their own that sent an air 
of palpable tension through Wells 
Fargo Arena as the Wolverines were 
forced into a 30-second timeout.
Moments later, a whistle came 
piercing through the building as 
Poole went crashing to the floor 
in front of Michigan’s bench. His 
3-point attempt had smacked the 
front of the rim, but the foul call 
gave the Wolverines an opportunity 
to expand their lead back to nine. 
Poole — the subject of much of 
Beilein’s first-half frustration — 
calmly stepped to the line and did 
just that.
For the next seven minutes, 
the teams traded baskets, Florida 
wedging its foot in the door but 
never daring to enter. On the rare 
occasion that the Gators threatened 
— they managed just 21 points 
after halftime — the Wolverines 
responded with some buffer of their 
own.

“We hang our hats on defense,” 
said assistant coach DeAndre 
Haynes. “Coach (Yaklich) does a 
great job. All our staff come together 
to see how we can stop their offense. 
And these guys right here, I give the 
credit to our players.”
With Michigan’s lead at 11 and 
the game’s final stretch teetering 
on becoming a formality, Zavier 
Simpson cocked the ball above his 
right shoulder and sliced a bounce 
pass through the Florida defense 
and into the hands of Isaiah Livers.
Between Livers and the basket 
stood 
Florida 
guard 
Andrew 
Nembhard, but not in Livers’ mind. 
The sophomore forward took to the 
air just beyond the restricted arc 
and delivered a two-hand slam over 
Nembhard, sending the arena into 
hysteria and — more importantly 
— the Wolverines into the Sweet 
Sixteen.
An hour later, as Haynes packed 
his bags and headed for the team 
bus, he, like the rest of the team, was 
met with congratulatory greetings 
from Kathleen Beilein, John’s wife.
By that point, there was just one 
thing left to say.
“Thanks, Mrs. B. We going to 
Cali!”

Poole gets another step closer to shedding the stigma of ‘The Shot’

DES 
MOINES, 
Iowa 
— 
Jordan Poole walked to the 
bench. DeAndre Haynes had a 
message.
In the midst of a first half 
that defined the two-sidedness 
of Poole’s game and his season, 
the sophomore guard had just 
driven the lane, shot-faked, 
then thrown up a floater with 
no chance of hitting. Earlier, he 
hit two 3-pointers with hands 
in his face, one of them while 
falling to the floor, helping 
Michigan to an early lead 
against Florida. Now, that lead 
was in jeopardy.
“Hey, take a deep breath. 
Breathe,” Haynes, an assistant 
coach, recalled telling Poole. 
“Just slow down, take the easy 
shots that they give you. When 
they close out hard, just drive 
past, to either take a shot or 

make somebody else better.”
So, when the Wolverines 
came out in the second half, 
Poole looked for Jon Teske 
down low, found the right angle 
on an entry pass and picked 
up an assist. Next time down, 
with the lane open, he drove, 
winding his body and finishing 
through 
contact. 
Then, 
he 
swished a step-back three.
Poole, all told, scored 19 
points, shot 4-of-9 from 3-point 
range and buoyed Michigan to 
a 64-49 win over the Gators 
and its third-straight Sweet 
Sixteen. Last year, it was Poole 
who sent them there. The 
questions about the shot against 
Houston flowed towards Poole 
on Saturday. Inevitably, they 
always will. Jordan Poole will 
never escape it.
One day after the season, 
Poole was working with Isaiah 
Livers in the gym and stopped 
to take a picture. Livers made 

fun, saying something to the 
effect of, “You made the big 
shots, Mr. Big Shots.” Poole 
snarled.
“I don’t wanna be known 
for only just the 
shot,” Poole said. 
“Know what I’m 
saying? 
Being 
able to put all the 
hard work that I 
have in, being 
able to start, get 
the opportunity. 
Last year I think 
I 
only 
played 
11 
minutes, 
something 
like 
that, in that game.”
On Saturday, Poole played 
33 minutes. He took some bad 
shots, a whole lot more good 
shots, played strong defense 
and helped his team win. The 
shot 
against 
Houston 
was 
great. But performances like 
Saturday’s are what Poole cares 
about.

He has put in extra time, 
over the summer and during 
the season, as coaches have 
stressed time and time again 
to keep things simple, let the 
game come to 
him. 
Those 
clichés, 
for 
Poole, represent 
consistency.
Just last week, 
on an equally big 
stage 
against 
Michigan State, 
Poole tried to 
force up shots 
and went 3-for-
7 from beyond 
the arc, missing a potential 
game-tying shot. Consistency 
is an elusive ideal — and it’s one 
Poole has worked towards in 
the good times and bad.
“He just doesn’t show up, 
enjoy the bright lights,” said 
assistant coach Luke Yaklich. 
“He works for the bright lights.”
Poole 
will 
always 
be 

recognized for the shot. It will 
be on every highlight, every 
pregame video at Crisler Center, 
every YouTube compilation of 
March buzzer-beaters.
Poole is just fine with that. 
But the rest is what matters.
“Obviously it’s an amazing 
opportunity to make a 3-point 
shot, and advance us to the 
Sweet Sixteen as a freshmen,” 
Poole said. “But I’ve worked so 
hard and have so much more 
to my game that I’m not able 
to show. I am able to show — 
to be in a position like this, 
spending days, countless hours 
and summers in the gym is 
just something that I feel like I 
work on.”
Games like Saturday, where 
Poole leads his team to its 
biggest win of the season, 
staying alive and getting one 
step closer to the ultimate 
goal of a national title, are the 
reward for those hours, that 
time.

He’s had games like this 
during the regular season, of 
course, and proved himself 
beyond the shot before. But 
this is on a bigger stage, with 
brighter 
lights 
and 
bigger 
stakes. To shed that image, at 
least as much as history will 
allow, these are the types of 
games Poole must have.
After 
the 
reporters 
had 
cleared 
out 
of 
Michigan’s 
locker room and John Beilein 
was ready to hop on a plane, 
the grace of home beckoning, 
he leaned in close with a final 
point to make about Poole and 
about that goal.
“We’re all working really 
hard with him to become a 
basketball 
player,” 
Beilein 
told The Daily. “A really good 
basketball player. Not just play 
basketball. Become a basketball 
player.”
On Saturday, that’s what 
Poole was. He’d like you to 
remember it.
