ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Activist 
Cheryl 
Brown 
Henderson delivered a lecture 
on the legacy of landmark 
desegregation 
Supreme 
Court case Brown v. Board of 
Education 
before 
hundreds 
of people in the Michigan 
League 
Ballroom 
Monday 
afternoon. The talk was part 
of the University of Michigan’s 
Martin 
Luther 
King 
Jr. 
Symposium.
Brown Henderson is the 
daughter of lead plaintiff Oliver 
Brown in Brown v. Board 
of Education and founding 

president 
of 
The 
Brown 
Foundation 
for 
Educational 
Equity, 
Excellence 
and 
Research. The foundation aims 
to uphold the decision made in 
Brown v. Board and provides 
scholarships 
to 
minority 
students.
She said Brown v. Board’s 
legal 
and 
cultural 
impact 
is huge in this country, and 
continues to protect key rights.
“Brown represents the need 
to have this country live up to 
its 
constitutional 
principles 
and its founding documents 
and all of the things you know 
were not originally intended 
for us,” Brown Henderson 

said. “Brown v. Board basically 
defended the sovereign power 
of all of us in this room as U.S. 
citizens not to have our rights 
arbitrarily restricted by state 
and local governments.”
Brown Henderson tied her 
experiences as a teacher to 
the Symposium’s theme, “The 
(Mis)Education of US.” The 
theme aims to address how 
minority groups and their 
experiences are often sidelined, 
and how this can lead to bias 
and discrimination.
“We don’t understand the 
importance 
of 
teachers,” 
Brown 
Henderson 
said. 
“Teachers are the bedrock, and 

you cannot build a skyscraper 
without bedrock. If you take 
the teachers out of the mix, it 
would be utter chaos.”
Rackham student Naitnaphit 
Limlamai told The Daily after 
the event that she agreed with 
Brown Henderson from her 
vantage point as a high school 
English teacher for 13 years.
“They do these studies where 
everyone loves the school in 
their district, but overall they 
think the schools are awful in 
the United States,” Limlamai 
said. “How is that possible if 
everyone thinks their school 
district is awesome? 

Around 10 Friends of Ann 
Arbor 
Wildlife 
in 
Nature 
members protested the city’s 
fifth 
annual 
deer 
cull 
on 
Saturday 
afternoon 
along 
Washtenaw Avenue. 
The controversial deer cull 
is a city-organized program 
meant to control the deer 
overpopulation 
through 
sharpshooting and sterilization. 
FAAWN members also protested 
against the beginning of last 
year’s deer cull. 

Despite 
freezing 

temperatures and icy conditions, 
FAAWN member Terry Abrams 
said he held signs for an hour to 
raise awareness of the deer cull 
and their opposition to it. 
“We’re here for a number 
of reasons,” Abrams said. “We 
oppose the killing of wildlife in 
the city. We think it’s morally 
wrong to kill the deer. We also 
think it is a waste of taxpayer 
money.” 
Abrams 
said 
he 
believes 
the city of Ann Arbor misused 
metrics and statistical data in 
calculating the deer population, 
which he claimed led to a 
renewal of the sharpshooter 
contract.

Joseph C. Hill, professor at 
the National Technical Institute 
for the Deaf, spoke on the stigma 
surrounding sign language and 
the discrimination that follows on 
Friday evening. The University of 
Michigan Linguistics Department 
hosted the event, drawing an 
audience of about 200 students 
and professors.
The 
talk, 
titled 
“Black, 
Deaf and Disabled: Navigating 
the 
Institutional, 
Ideological 
and 
Linguistic 
Barriers 
with 
Intersectional Identities in the 
United States,” was presented by 
Hill in American Sign Language, 
with a translator communicating 
the talk to audience members who 
do not know ASL. 
Hill spoke about research that 
confirmed a variation in Black and 
White American Sign Language 
and the need to increase the 
number of Black deaf students in 
ASL classes. He also commented 
on a lack of awareness on what 
makes Black ASL unique. 
“We need interpreting and 
deaf education to understand how 
they connect with the Black deaf 
community because this is a part 
of American history as well,” Hill 
said.

Angela Davis discusses 
 
prison reform, civil rights

“It is important for us to learn 
how to pay tribute to those whose 
names we don’t necessarily know,” 
activist and Martin Luther King Jr. 
symposium keynote speaker Angela 
Davis said in her lecture Monday 
morning at Hill Auditorium. 
“And to recognize that the agents 
of history are not so much the leaders 
and the spokespeople but rather 
the masses of people who develop a 
collective imagination regarding the 
possibility of a new future.”
Hill Auditorium was filled to 
capacity for Davis, a prominent 
activist, author and distinguished 
Professor Emerita at the University 
of California, Santa Cruz. 
The 
Office 
of 
Academic 
Multicultural Initiatives (OAMI), 
among other University of Michigan 
departments, 
sponsored 
The 
Martin Luther King 
Jr. 
symposium. 
The theme of the 
symposium was “The 
(Mis)Education 
of 
US.”
Davis has taught 
at 
the 
University 
of 
California, 
Los 
Angeles, 
Syracuse 
University, 
Vassar 
College, 
Stanford 
University 
and 
others. Davis is also 
the author of novels 

such as “Are Prisons Obsolete?” and 
a collection of essays called “The 
Meaning of Freedom.”
Davis was once on the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation’s Ten Most-
Wanted Fugitives list and a registered 
member of the Communist Party for 
over 30 years. She was also involved 
with the Black Panther Party and 
feminist movements.
The anticipated turnout was 
accounted for by overflow rooms in 
the Michigan League and Hatcher 
Auditorium. 
Robert 
M. Sellers, vice 
provost 
for 
Equity and 

Inclusion, and University President 
Mark Schissel provided opening 
remarks before Davis took the stage.

Susan Rice shares experience 
as woman of color in politics
Former UN ambassador gives insight on Benghazi, Iran

In commemoration of Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day, Susan 
Rice, former United Nations 
Ambassador and former National 
Security Advisor, recalled her 
favorite quote by Dr. King: “The 
arc of the moral universe is long, 
but it bends towards justice.” 
The quote was woven along the 
edges of the Oval Office carpet at 
the beginning of 
the 
Obama 

Administration. 
Ambassador 
Rice said the quote was the 
guiding principle of her life in 
public service.
“Nobody is going to do the 
hard bending, if not you and me,” 
Rice said.
On 
Monday 
afternoon, 
hundreds 
of 
students 
and 
community members including 
Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., 
filled 
Annenberg 
Auditorium 
and dozens packed into overflow 
rooms in the Ford 
School of Public 
Policy to hear 
Rice. 
Rice 
has 
spent 
decades 
in public service, 
most 
recently 
serving as the 
U.S. 
National 
Security Advisor 
from 2013 to 2017 
and U.S. 

Permanent Representative in the 
United Nations from 2009 to 2013 
in the Obama administration.
The event was a collaboration 
between the MLK Jr. Symposium 
and 
the 
Weiser 
Diplomacy 
Center. Michael S. Barr, dean 
of the Public Policy School and 
a former colleague of Rice, 
moderated 
the 
conversation 
and the student Q&A session. 
During the talk, Rice discussed 
her foreign policy decisions, the 
2012 Benghazi scandal and the 
challenges she faced as a woman 
of color.
Rice 
began 
by 
discussing 
the title of her new book, 
“Tough Love: My Story of the 
Things Worth Fighting For.” 
Rice credited tough love as an 
aspect of leadership that has 
encompassed her personal and 
professional life.
“Tough love means loving 
fiercely but not uncritically. 
It means that when you care 
deeply about somebody,” 
Rice 
said. 
“You 
care 
enough to give them your 
unvarnished truth. And do 
it from the vantage point of 
someone who has their best 
interests at heart. (It’s) how 
I’ve tried to serve our country. 
I love this country passionately, 
but I believe we have and do and 
will make mistakes. And we 
need to acknowledge 
them and learn from 
them.”

Rina Agarwala, associate 
professor 
of 
sociology 
at 
Johns 
Hopkins 
University 
discussed the history of Indian 
emigration at Weiser Hall on 
Friday afternoon. 
The Center for South Asian 
Studies hosted the event as 
part of a series on the history 
of emigration and how social 
class 
has 
shaped 
India’s 
emigration policy since its 
independence in 1947.
Approximately 
15 
people 
attended 
the 
presentation 
titled “Managing Migrants: 
Class and Emigration from 
India,” on Monday afternoon. 
Agarwala centered her talk on 
how Indian emigrants affect 
the country’s economic and 
political development as well 
as how the country enacts 
policy to encourage emigration 
in particular social classes. 
Director 
of 
CSAS 
Leela 
Fernandes 
explained 
how 
the Center plans its events 
a year in advance, including 
Agarwala’s presentation.
“We 
solicit 
suggestions 
from the whole faculty, all the 
affiliates, and then we make 
a list, discuss them and then 
some of it depends on speaker 
availability,” Fernandes said. 
“We have a couple of very 
different backgrounds and we 
usually try to be representative 
of different disciplines from 
history to anthropology and 
sociology.” 
Agarwala 
explained 
her 

focus 
on 
the 
relationship 
between emigrants and the 
country 
they 
leave 
rather 
than the relationship between 
immigrants and the country 
they enter. She described the 
common narratives the media 
and academia use to depict 
immigration as a danger to 
a country and emigration as 
an attempt to secure a better 
future.
“When 
we 
talk 
about 
international migration, by far 
the biggest focus of scholars 
and media is on receiving 
countries,” 
Agarwala 
said. 
“In contrast to the picture 
we see in receiving countries, 
where it’s a point of tension 
and a flashpoint, in sending 
countries, emigration, which 
is sending the migrants out, is 
often depicted as a pathway to 
hope, development, prosperity 
and 
a 
legitimate 
global 
position.”
According 
to 
Agarwala, 
India is the largest emigrant-
sending country in the world, 
with 
approximately 
15.6 
million 
emigrants 
living 
abroad. She explained many 
of these emigrants provide 
what 
she 
characterized 
as low-skilled labor in the 
Middle 
East 
while 
some 
are emigrants with higher 
education degrees who often 
enter Western countries. 
Though Agarwala said the 
country’s emigrants send a 
low amount of Foreign Direct 
Investments 
— 
business 
investments within a country 
that 
come 
from 
foreign 

residents — she emphasized 
that they remain important to 
the country by sending about 
$72 billion in remittances, 
which 
are 
finances 
sent 
to 
an 
individual’s 
family 
or 
community. 
These 
remittances primarily come 
from Indian workers in the 
Middle East and reportedly 
account for about 4 percent of 
the country’s GDP.
Agarwala framed her talk 
around what she characterized 
as a puzzle in the history of 
Indian emigration policy. She 
said despite the remittances 
from 
low-skill 
emigrants, 
the country has historically 
restricted 
low-skilled 
emigrants while encouraging 
high-skilled emigrants.
“If 
investment 
into 
emigration 
is 
a 
function 
of 
national 
economic 
development, 
why 
would 
the Indian state be investing 
so much in its high-skilled 
migrants abroad when they 
are gaining so very little from 
them in economic terms?” 
Agarwala said. “And similarly, 
in terms of the low-skilled 
migrants, 
when 
(India 
is) 
gaining so much from them, 
why are they not investing (in) 
or recognizing them more as 
the Philippines does or Mexico 
has?”
Agarwala 
said 
after 
India’s 
independence, 
the 
country justified its explicit 
restrictions 
on 
low-skill 
emigration as a means of 
protecting them. Emigration 
policy shifted, according to 

Agarwala, when the oil boom 
in the Middle East began in the 
1970s. The greater demand for 
labor caused the government 
to gradually allow for greater 
low-skilled emigration.
India 
began 
to 
expand 
social welfare and government 
agencies in the 1970s and early 
1980s to help support low-
skill 
emigration, 
Agarwala 
explained. However, additional 
restrictions 
remained, 
she 
said. The government claimed 
they were in place to protect 
vulnerable groups of workers, 
including 
restrictions 
on 
women emigrating from the 
country. 
Agarwala said ultimately, 
India sought to present itself 
as a source of workers who 
emigrate across the world. 
“In order to protect India’s 
national image in the world, 
government 
officials 
… 
have 
projected 
low-skilled 
immigration as a result of 
India’s 
advanced, 
efficient 
and modern political society,” 
Agarwala said. “India posits 
itself as a sending country 
of high quality labor at the 
tertiary level, but also at the 
low-skill level.”
LSA senior Shreya Chandra 
attended the event for her 
South Asian diaspora course 
and said she believed the talk 
was thought-provoking.
“I 
never 
really 
thought 
about, like as she was saying, 
the emigrant side of it, so that 
was really interesting to hear 
about,” Chandra said.

She said she achieved many 
high-profile positions relatively 
young. This caused a unique set 
of problems, particularly when 
learning to lead teams with 
coworkers and subordinates who 
were decades older than her. She 
noted that women and people of 

color have to make sure to work 
twice as hard, especially in these 
positions. 
“(You’ve 
got 
to 
be) 
hardworking and prepared. You 
know, you can’t mail it in,” Rice 
said. “You’ve gotta be as good 
as you possibly can be and 
take the time to be maximally 
prepared. 
I 
think 
that’s 
important for women and for 
people of color because you’re 
not going to be cut any slack. 

You’re not going to necessarily 
get a second chance to make a 
first impression.” 
Rice was also candid when 
sharing the obstacles she faced 
as a young woman of color 
serving with predominantly 
white, male diplomats. She 
acknowledged 
that 
it 
was 
incredibly difficult to lead 
a team when many of them 
believed she didn’t deserve the 
job. 

“When I got to the State 
Department at 32, I was an 
African-American woman who 
just had a baby, a breastfeeding 
mother,” Rice said. “And so 
figuring out in that context, 
you know, how to lead and 
manage teams when, frankly, 
many of them thought I didn’t 
deserve to be in a job I was in, 
was a real challenge.”

“The city is not using metrics to 
determine how many deer there 
are in the city or how successful the 
program of killing deer for the last 
few years has been,” Abrams said. 
“So they keep renewing the (White 
Buffalo Inc. sharpshooter) contract.” 
Other members of FAAWN, 
such as Cathy Shafer, agreed with 
Abrams, saying she believes the city 
of Ann Arbor hasn’t progressed in 
reducing the deer population by 
conducting this deer cull. 
“It doesn’t seem to –– according to 
(city officials) –– have improved the 
situation they’re concerned about,” 
Shafer said. “It isn’t going anywhere, 
so I think it is a waste of (taxpayer) 
money.”
One reason the deer cull began was 
in response to city officials receiving 
complaints that deer were eating 

garden plants. However, FAAWN 
member Marianne Lembfeld said it 
is the city’s construction efforts that 
have given the deer no choice but to 
come farther inside the city and eat 
some at some of the gardens.
“It 
is 
morally 
wrong 
to 
sharpshoot animals who came to 
this city,” Lembfeld said. “There is 
so much construction going on at 
the outskirts of Ann Arbor, where 
the deer used to live. Where should 
they go?” 
Abrams said gardeners should be 
taught effective ways to maintain 
a beneficial environment for both 
gardeners and deer. 
“There are methods of doing that, 
as there are plants that deer like and 
plants that deer don’t like,” Abrams 
said. “There’s fencing that they can 
employ in their gardens.”
Abrams said FAAWN members 
have 
been 
attending 
public 
city meetings to describe their 
frustrations about the deer cull. 
“There are a lot of people in the 
city who actually enjoy seeing deer,” 
Abrams stated. “So (city officials) 
they’re saying they’re going to 
address a problem because of the 
deer, but they’re not addressing the 
enjoyment that residents of Ann 
Arbor have by seeing the deer.” 
Ann Arbor resident Bernie Banet 
expressed his confusion about why 
deer culling is a topic of contention.
“Some of us are completely 
baffled at why 150 deer in Ann Arbor 
get all the attention from some of 
the animal protection groups and 
they say nothing about thousands of 
deer. It’s very strange,” Banet said. 
“They may have some reason for 
focusing on Ann Arbor, but it’s not 
part of a consistent ethical stance or 
a political opposition to hunting. It’s 
just a weird Ann Arbor thing.”
Christopher Dick, a professor of 
ecology and evolutionary biology 
at the University of Michigan, 
previously told The Daily he thinks 
the cull is necessary to keep the deer 
population in check and protect the 
local ecosystem.
“They basically eat away at the 
forest understory, so there’s no 
regeneration of the forest,” Dick said. 

“Also, people see Black Deaf 
ASL and recognize it, but they 
don’t 
necessarily 
understand 
what makes it and how exactly it 
is different and unique from the 
other language variations that 
are out there.”
Hill 
also 
commented 
on 
the 
myth 
that 
American 
Sign Language is universally 
understood.
“A lot of people here think that 
oh, American Sign Language 
must be universal,” Hill said. 
“No, it’s not. Gestures and 
movements might be, but the 
actual features of the language 
are not.”
Hill 
discussed 
intersectionality as it applies 
to sign language, adding that 
different 
identities 
impact 

differences in language.
“You have to consider the 
intersectionality of individuals 
as 
a 
factor 
for 
language 
variation,” Hill said. “Often it’s 
not just one identity but several 
that come into play and you don’t 
even have to pick a primary 
or prioritize any one of those 
languages.”
Hill said audism, a form of 
discrimination 
against 
deaf 
people, affects the daily lives of 
those with hearing loss.
“It is a type of marginalization 
or oppression,” Hill said. “It 
means things like no closed 
captioning, or when I show up 
there is no interpreter. It impacts 
your earning potential and your 
educational opportunities, as 
well.” 
Hill said some parents of 
deaf 
children 
are 
advised 
against teaching their children 
sign 
language 
due 
to 
the 
stigma against it. He spoke 

about how this impacts deaf 
children’s growth and essential 
development. 
“When they’re not being taught 
sign language, it’s language 
deprivation,” Hill said. “It is 
connected with their health, it is 
their social connection, it is their 
comprehensive 
development 
that is being impacted.”
During 
his 
lecture, 
Hill 
showed the audience a video 
addressing 
the 
opinions 
of 
older and younger generations 
in 
regards 
to 
differences 
between Black and White ASL. 
Hill highlighted the contrast 
between the viewpoints of the 
two generations.
“You’ll see the elder group 
talking about their language and 
they do notice the differences 
between White and Black ASL,” 
Hill said. “But there’s no pride 
in 
their 
language, 
whereas 
the younger group sees it as a 
connection to their culture or 

their identity and their social 
group. The older group seemed 
to have a more minor view of 
their own language whereas the 
younger group is more positive.”
Rackham 
student 
Kate 
Sherwood said it is essential for 
people to realize the differences 
between Black and White ASL 
to avoid the misconception that 
Black ASL doesn’t exist. 
“If you don’t acknowledge 
the difference in White ASL 
and Black ASL, you’re going 
to assume that White ASL is 
the only thing there is, which 
is false,” Sherwood said. “It 
would also result in a lot of 
marginalization of Black ASL 
speakers.”
Rackham 
student 
Rachel 
Weissler 
agreed 
about 
the 
importance of recognizing the 
variations in forms of ASL.

Jeryne Fish, Business graduate 
student 
and 
student-athlete, 
introduced Davis by talking about 
Davis’ life as an activist and how 
that has affected her work. 
The Guild, a poetry collective, 
kicked off the event with a skit and 
poem about highlighting narratives 
often 
overlooked 
in 
American 
classrooms. 
Guild member Candace Jackson, 
Rackham student, told The Daily 
the message of the performance was 
to show different perspectives in 
history that have been sugarcoated. 
“A lot of the events that 
happened throughout the Civil 
Rights Movement and beyond 
with 
indigenous 
people 
are 
usually sugarcoated, they’re not 
usually the truth,” Jackson said. 
“They’re typically skewed to favor 
the dominant, white, upper-class 
perspective. So we’re just trying to 
shed light on that perspective.”
Davis was welcomed onto the 
stage with a standing ovation. She 
started her speech speaking about 
King, mentioning the fact that King 
spoke at the University in 1962. She 
noted having seen King, Rosa Parks 
and Malcolm X in her youth, adding 
that elementary students even asked 
her if she had met Harriet Tubman.
In her talk, Davis emphasized 
celebrating King’s birthday as a 
symbol of achievement after the 
struggle for Black freedom. 
“With MLK Day, not only do we 
celebrate the spirit of a Civil Rights 
Movement, but also the fact that 
the declaration of King’s birthday 
as an official holiday,” Davis said. 
“Because this is the outcome of a 

very long struggle.”
Sellers recognized that the land 
the University campus resides on 
belonged to indigenous people. 
Davis said other universities she’s 
spoken at have not made that same 
acknowledgement. 
Davis also discussed the role 
indigenous people played in helping 
the Black struggle for freedom, 
referencing slave rebellions in South 
Carolina and Hispaniola.
“In each of those uprisings, 
African people were assisted by 
indigenous people,” Davis said. 
“You can not accurately narrate 
the history of the Black struggle 
for freedom without taking into 
account the pivotal role that the 
indigenous people played in that 
struggle.”
LSA 
freshman 
Clara 
Paz 
Núñez-Regueiro said she felt 
it was important that Davis 
acknowledged 
the 
connection 
between 
the 
struggles 
of 
indigenous 
people 
and 
Black 
people. 
“One of the things that really 
stood out to me, especially as a 
woman of indigenous descent, 
is the fact that she spoke about 
the solidarity between Black and 
indigenous people and how our 
struggle for liberation and for 
equality is so much more than 
that,” Núñez-Regueiro said. “It’s 
so intertwined and intrinsically 
connected, and that was incredible. 
I feel so cleansed after seeing that.”
One of Davis’ passions is prison 
reform, as she spent 18 months 
in jail and on trial during the 
1970s. She touched on the issues 
of the prison system and how 
companies are making profits from 
deportations and building larger 
prisons. Davis shared an example 

of how the company G4S is making 
a profit from the prison system and 
deportation services. 
“One of the largest corporations 
in the world, G4S, is self-identified 
as the world’s leading global 
integrated, security company … 
G4S has owned for-profit prisons 
all over the country and all over 
the world,” Davis said. “Most of 
its custodial, education services, 
immigration and border services 
and its rehabilitation services … are 
services for profit.”
Davis spoke about abolishing 
the prison system, linking it to the 
system of slavery. 
“Abolition is not simply about 
abolishing the institution of the 
prison as a discrete institution,” 
Davis said. “It is not enough to focus 
on abolition in the narrow sense 
and this we learned as lessons from 
the so-called abolition of slavery.”
LSA freshman Binta Wilson 
told The Daily Davis’ words 
on incarceration changed her 
perspective on the government’s 
role within the prison system. 
“I resonated with (her talk) 
because 
it 
just 
changed 
my 
viewpoint on a lot of things in the 
government, in the country as a 
whole and other countries,” Wilson 
said. “She basically alluded that the 
prison system was like modern-
day slavery and that is true. I do 
believe that and that touched me.” 
Davis also emphasized that 
many progressive achievements 
get 
universalized, 
implying 
more change than what actually 
occurred. She used women gaining 
the right to vote as an example 
— this historic achievement only 
granted white women the vote.
“This is the year 2020,” Davis 
said. “What significant centennial 

anniversary are we observing this 
year? … White women got the vote 
in 1920. That is what we should 
acknowledge, and that is very 
important, and I applaud that. But 
all women did not get the vote in 
1920. Black women did not legally 
acquire the right to vote until 1965, 
with the passage of the Voting 
Rights Act.”

In her ending remarks, Davis 
also discussed respecting those 
who identify with the LGTBQ+ 
movement and their contributions 
to the Civil Rights Movement.
“Feminism is important not 
simply to acknowledge that women 
are affected by the prison system, 
(but) trans people and gender non-
conforming people,” Davis said.
LSA freshman Will McClelland 
told The Daily Davis’ words about 
the LGBTQ community meant a 
lot to him because of his personal 
experiences. 
“What really stuck out to me 
was near the end when she started 
talking about trans and non-
binary people, just because that’s 
an issue especially close to home 
for me,” McClean said. “It’s really 
important to see a lot of these 
issues interconnected. I think 
she really emphasized how all of 
these social problems that we have 
are so firmly entrenched and the 
connections going between all of 
it, and I think a lot of that does fall 
under the capitalist institutions.” 
LSA freshman Mahnoor Imran 
said she admired how Davis spoke 
about multiple issues to show 
the audience how they are all 
interconnected.

Rice said her motivation to 
write her memoir stemmed from 
the accusations during and after 
the attack on two United States 
government facilities in Benghazi 
in 2012, which she acknowledges 
as a pivotal moment in her life. 
She detailed making the decision 
to go on national television in 
place of then-Secretary Clinton, 
who had turned down the offer, 
and 
how 
she 
inadvertently 
gave false information due to 
incorrect intelligence.
“I (went on) the Sunday shows 
and I used the information that 
had been provided to me by 
our intelligence community,” 
Rice said. “The talking points 
… 
conveyed 
our 
current 
best knowledge of what had 
happened, and I stuck to them 
faithfully.”
Rice then detailed that after 
her appearances on national 
television, 
the 
intelligence 
community released a public 
statement that the information 
they had given to public officials, 
including 
Rice, 
contained 
inaccuracies.
“After all the investigations 
and reviews of the information, 
the 
talking 
points 
I 
used 
turned out to be wrong in one 
critical 
respect, 
there 
was 
no 
demonstration 
outside 
our diplomatic compound in 
Benghazi,” Rice said. “But the 
other aspects, over time, ended 
up holding up.”
In 
the 
aftermath 
of 
the 
scandal, Rice said she was 
attacked by several Congressmen 

who criticized her competence 
and 
intelligence. 
These 
continued 
attacks 
after 
the 
2012 election led her to remove 
herself from consideration as 
Secretary of State for President 
Obama’s second term.
“I was thinking about the 
President’s second term agenda; 
the things he had on his plate 
to do,” Rice said. “Even if I was 
likely to be confirmed … it would 
have been a long, ugly, costly 
battle that would have distracted 
from what we needed to get done. 
And so I made the judgment that 
I should withdraw my name.”
Yet Rice was also frustrated 
by mischaracterizations from 
both sides of the media. She 
said she remembers either being 
characterized as a liar and 
villain or on the other extreme, 
a hero. She said as a public 
servant representing the United 
States, speaking on behalf of 
the country and the President, 
she could not speak on her own 
behalf.
“Part of why I wanted to 
write ‘Tough Love’ was not 
only to share what I have 
learned through my family, my 
growing up, and my service in 
government. But also to do what 
my father had always taught 
us which is: ‘define yourself for 
yourself,’” Rice said.
Rice’s advice appealed to 
students who found it refreshing 
to 
hear 
about 
leadership 
experiences in a candid manner. 
Public 
Policy 
senior 
Lillie 
Heyman said Rice’s call to action 
was particularly impactful.

So it’s not just about valuing 
teachers but it’s also about 
supporting them.”
Brown 
Henderson 
emphasized 
the 
ongoing 
inequalities 
in 
American 
education, 
citing 
the 
contemporary charter school 
and 
voucher 
movements. 
She 
also 
said 
the 
well-
known 
Supreme 
Court 
announcement from Brown v. 
Board, “in the field of public 
education, separate but equal 

has no place,” was not the 
most important aspect of the 
decision.
“The part of the opinion 
I 
believe 
he 
should’ve 
announced says that education 
is the most important act of 
state and local governments, 
and that no child can expect 
to succeed in life without 
the benefits of an education 
and that education is the 
foundation of citizenship and 
should on an equal measure,” 
Brown 
Henderson 
said. 
“Maybe we wouldn’t still be 
fighting, 66 years later, over 
who has a right to a world-

class education.” 
LSA 
freshman 
Taylor 
Johnson said she appreciated 
the 
historical 
significance 
of Brown Henderson’s visit 
to the University and said it 
put her own experience on 
campus in perspective. 
“It’s a once in a lifetime 
opportunity to have someone 
who 
lived 
during 
that 
time where people like me 
struggled to get an education 
that was deemed adequate,” 
Johnson said. “I feel like 
for students of color it’s a 
really big thing to take your 
education 
seriously 
since 

these 
people 
had 
to 
get 
taunted basically every single 
day while trying to go to 
these schools that were newly 
integrated.”
At 
the 
end 
of 
her 
presentation, 
Brown 
Henderson 
called 
the 
audience 
to 
action, 
encouraging everyone to vote 
if they want to see a more 
equitable education system.
“It’s up to us to speak out, 
especially at the ballot box,” 
Brown 
Henderson 
said. 
“Being a United States citizen 
is not a spectator sport. It’s 
not something you can just sit 

idly by and observe. You have 
to be engaged, you have to 
participate.”
Following 
the 
event, 
LSA 
senior 
Nando 
Felton 
told 
The 
Daily 
Brown 
Henderson’s lecture inspired 
him as he starts a nonprofit 
organization in the education 
sector and hopes to work in 
education policy.
“In the grand scheme of 
things, we have to put people 
in office that make positive 
change, we have to make 
sure that the administration 
makes the change, and even 
the person that ends up in 

the White House has to make 
that change,” Felton said. 
“That’s the kind of work and 
the footsteps I want to follow 
to make sure I can be in a 
position to make change.”
Brown Henderson closed 
her talk with a message of 
unity. 
“Often 
times 
I 
think 
our biggest challenge with 
respect to race and diversity, 
multicultural 
issues 
and 
issues 
of 
gender, 
is 
a 
perception gap,” she said. “If 
you sit down over a cup of 
coffee, that perception soon 
melts away.”

We need to promote tougher border security

I

n a bold policy move taking 
place in the final days of 
2019, New Jersey lawmakers 
approved legislation that would 
permit undocumented immigrants 
in the state to secure drivers’ 
licenses. Signed shortly after by 
Gov. Phil Murphy, New Jersey 
has now joined several other 
states, including New York and 
California, 
who 
have 
already 
begun offering licenses to millions 
of 
undocumented 
immigrants 
across the country. 
With the proposal dominated 
by Democratic support, advocates 
emphasize 
the 
safer 
driving 
conditions 
that 
the 
practice 
generates 
for 
undocumented 
immigrants and all motorists in 
general. Fewer unlicensed drivers 
mean better roads for everybody.
Many 
conservatives 
have 
grumbled about this news, but 
there’s nothing wrong with policies 
that make our roads and highways 
safer. Officials in New Jersey are 
serving their constituencies and 
confronting the concerning flood 
of 
undocumented 
immigration 
into our nation. These states aren’t 
to blame for our immigration 
problem. 
These 
states 
are 
responding to the problem.
In the end, these policy moves 
point to the steady stream of 
undocumented immigration that 
made them necessary in the first 
place. People who aren’t taking 
the correct steps to live in The 
United States are flocking here 
in great numbers. According to 
figures published by the Pew 
Research Center, the number 
of 
undocumented 
immigrants 
across the U.S. has steadily risen 
since 1990 until about 2010, after 
which it has more or less remained 
constant, if not fallen. 
However, U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection data proves this 

problem is still rampant, indicating 
that hundreds of thousands of 
undocumented immigrants are 
still apprehended every year at our 
borders. In 2017, about 300,000 
individuals were detained at the 
southwestern border, lower than 
previous years but still far too large. 
States like Wyoming are home to 
less than 600,000 people in their 
entirety.
Undocumented 
immigrants 
are not bad people. They are 
individuals 
from 
all 
different 
backgrounds who want a better 
shot at a safe and secure life. They 
want their children to have better 
lives and they want to be part of 
our great nation. Unfortunately, 
when they fail to take the necessary 
steps to lawfully enter the U.S. and 
instead become undocumented, 
immigrants not only endanger 
themselves and others, but they 
also pose a dangerous risk to our 
security, economy and society.
Large-scale 
undocumented 
immigration 
is 
unacceptable 
because 
it 
carries 
so 
many 
risks. 
Allowing 
undocumented 
immigration to occur is a direct 
assault on the well-being of the 
migrants 
themselves, 
not 
to 
mention the potential danger for 
American citizens. According to an 
ABC News report published about 
a year ago, hundreds of immigrants 
die trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico 
border every year. Many others, 
according to the Department of 
Homeland Security, have been 
rescued by authorities from deadly 
situations. 
Far beyond this, undocumented 
immigration poses a serious threat 
to national security, something 
that has a profound effect on us all. 
How can anybody be comfortable 
with letting people into our nation 
that we know nothing about? 
While we don’t know a good deal 

about many U.S. citizens, we have 
an obligation to get to know those 
who originate from other locations 
before welcoming them to our 
country. According to the Heritage 
Foundation, a think-tank based in 
Washington, D.C., non-citizens 
made up 64 percent of all federal 
arrests in 2018 despite comprising 
only 7 percent of the national 
population (although this may be 
due to their undocumentated status 
instead of further crimes committed 
on American soil). In Texas, a large 
border state, the Foundation noted 
that undocumented immigrants 
accounted for nearly 70 percent of 
the state’s prison population over 
roughly the last decade. In the 
same timeframe, undocumented 
immigrants have been charged with 
almost 500,000 criminal offenses, 
including assaults, homicides and 
kidnappings. 
Besides 
this, 
undocumented 
immigrants 
have 
also 
been 
connected 
to 
extensive 
drug 
and 
human 
trafficking 
that 
have taken a great toll on border 
communities. “The fact that our 
border can be penetrated so easily 
leaves us vulnerable to national 
security threats and has resulted 
in an influx of criminal activity, 
especially as it relates to narcotics 
and human trafficking,” according 
to Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark. “It is 
a serious crisis in need of a serious 
legislative solution.” In addition 
to the horrific human trafficking 
situation that has unfolded at our 
borders, drug trafficking especially 
has endangered and destroyed 
countless lives in U.S. communities, 
throwing deadly illegal substances 
into every corner of our nation.

The need for congressional term limits
A

few weeks ago, I was 
scrolling through Twitter 
when I came across an 
article talking about the 84 current 
members of Congress who were also 
serving during President Clinton’s 
impeachment hearings. The Clinton 
impeachment took place in 1998, 
over two decades ago, before many 
University of Michigan students — 
myself included — were born. The 
fact that there are over 80 members 
serving today who have been in 
Congress longer than our lifetimes 
is absurd. That is why we need to 
work to implement term limits for 
our members of Congress. 
Currently, there are no term 
limits on how long a member of 
the House of Representatives or 
the Senate can serve. This leads to 
many members of Congress having 
extremely long tenures. Proponents 
of term limits argue that term limits 
will help bring new ideas to the table, 
encourage people to vote and lead to 
less gridlock in Washington. This is 
all grounded in the theory that one 
of the main issues in Washington 
today is aging lawmakers who have 
been in Congress for decades and 
subsequently have a monopoly on 
power. 
It is not hard to see validity in 
this point. Incumbent lawmakers 
do have many advantages, such as 
increased name recognition and 
successful campaign experience. 
This makes it difficult for other 
candidates 
to 
challenge 
them, 
whether 
through 
a 
primary 
challenge or in the general election. 
A 2018 analysis of incumbency 
reelection found sitting lawmakers 
being reelected over 80 percent of 
the time in all the local, state and 

federal races surveyed across the 
United States.
Even if new members make it 
into Congress, much of the power 
lies in the hands of the leadership, 
who are mostly career politicians 
with long tenures in Congress. 
This can prevent new lawmakers 
from making an impact, which in 
turn may send a message to voters 
that their vote doesn’t matter 
because their representative cannot 
accomplish anything. Therefore, 
many people argue that the best way 
to overcome this problem is through 
the passage of term limits, which 
will lead to new blood and an influx 
of unique ideas. 
Opponents of term limits argue 
that it is crucial to gain expertise 
and become knowledgeable on 
important issues — something that 
can only come with experience. 
Therefore, opponents argue that 
term limits will force out effective 
lawmakers. 
This 
won’t 
be 
a 
problem, given how much of the 
policy and constituent work is done 
by the staff, not the representatives 
themselves. 
My opinions about term limits 
are influenced by the experiences 
I have had working in politics. 
This past summer, I interned for 
my member of Congress in his 
district 
office. 
While 
working 
there, I learned about an aspect 
of Congressional work that is 
often 
forgotten: 
constituent 
casework. Every day, the staff at the 
Congressman’s office would work 
tirelessly to help constituents on 
issues ranging from immigration 
to social security to the postal 
service. The people working in 
the office had countless years of 

experience and knew the laws and 
the processes inside and out.
It is these government workers 
who are in the trenches on a daily 
basis working to help constituents. 
These are people with years 
of 
experience 
navigating 
the 
complicated bureaucratic system. 
I would hope that these dedicated 
and crucially important employees 
often retain their position, even if a 
new member is elected. This helps 
to assuage fears about term limits 
leading to a lack of experience, 
because experienced staff will still 
be in place. 
In order to help further alleviate 
the concerns of detractors, we 
should institute term limits that 
are long enough to allow for 
representatives to have enough 
time 
to 
complete 
meaningful 
work without serving for multiple 
decades. A good limit would be six 
terms, or 12 years, for the House 
and two terms, or 12 years, for the 
Senate. 12 years is a reasonable 
amount of time for members to 
accomplish a sufficient amount 
while still allowing an influx of 
new ideas and the ability for diverse 
voices to be heard.
Many politicians on both sides 
of the aisle, from Republican 
senators 
to 
Democratic 
presidential 
candidates, 
have 
called for term limits of this exact 
length. Change and progress help 
to make us grow stronger. By 
putting in place reasonable term 
limits, we can help to transform 
Congress into a more fair and 
effective legislative body.

Finding a sharper solution to the anti-vaccine movement
M

ary Poppins said it 
best 
— 
sometimes 
“a spoonful of sugar 
helps the medicine go down.” The 
saying refers to the general idea 
that 
accomplishing 
something 
unpleasant is more doable by 
manufacturing a bit of fun, but it 
can be seen quite literally in the 
world of medicine. We inject all 
sorts of sweetness into unpleasant 
tasks, especially those for children, 
such as adding fruity flavoring to 
cough syrups, shaping vitamins like 
cartoon characters and rewarding 
them with a piece of candy for good 
behavior at a doctor’s appointment. 
Administering shots is much more 
difficult to sweeten; not much can 
be done about the fact that the 
needle is going to pinch.
Still, many doctors and nurses 
try their best, by making shots 
into a fun game or by promising a 
special bandage after. Ensuring 
proper medical care is necessary to 
support individuals in leading their 
best lives and to produce a healthier 
population, but sometimes this 
care 
can 
be 
uncomfortable, 
frightening and downright painful. 
Many 
medical 
practitioners 
and 
institutions 
emphasize 
compassion, understanding and 
a little bit of sweetness to support 
their patients through difficult 
procedures. Unfortunately, this 
principle does seem to have its 
limits, especially when a medical 
issue becomes highly publicized. 
At present, the societal response 
to the hot button issue of the 
anti-vaccine movement has been 
overwhelmingly bitter.
It’s understandable why it’s 
difficult to take a saccharine 
approach to such a scary issue. 
Many believe the anti-vaccine 
movement will leave a large 
population vulnerable to illnesses 
with 
horrifying 
side 
effects 
which ravaged entire societies 
just decades ago. As such, the 
fear and rhetoric surrounding 
anti-vaccination are somewhat 
out of proportion to the actual 
scale of decreasing vaccinations. 
According to a 2017 report from 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC), vaccination 
rates 
remain 
relatively 
stable 
and high. Still, the same report 
does note that the proportion of 
children receiving no vaccines by 
24 months of age has increased, 
albeit slightly and gradually. This 
small increase matters, however; 
the decline in vaccinations is 
often credited as causing a “global 
resurgence” 
of 
preventable 
diseases, inhibiting the goal of 
eradication.
Measles 
is 
an 
especially 
notable example — although it 

was declared eliminated from 
the United States in 2000, it 
has recently made an infamous 
comeback. The year 2019 saw 
the highest number of reported 
cases since 1992, totaling 1,241 as 
of September 5. The prospect of 
measles and other debilitating and 
deadly diseases returning to the 
U.S. is certainly terrifying, so the 
vitriolic reaction to the anti-vaccine 
movement seems only natural. The 
term “anti-vaxxer” has become 
pejorative, often grouped with 
the same type of “stupid” as flat-
earthers 
and 
climate 
change 
deniers. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
vilification is unlikely to sway those 
hesitant about vaccination to the 
positive side.
In fact, a hateful response only 
serves to deepen divides, allowing 
the anti-vaccine movement to 
create a narrative of persecution. 
With the anti-vaccine sentiment 
taking a continually deeper hold in 
the U.S., it is imperative to reassess 
how we are approaching this 
movement, and shifting the basis 
of our policies and discussions to 
understanding and compassion.
For one, skepticism of vaccination 
is often treated as ignorance and 
stupidity. But many people have 
personal and cultural histories 
with the institution of medicine 
that 
lead 
to 
understandable 
hesitation and mistrust, which 
may include the prospect of 
vaccination. 
Furthermore, 
the 
concept of vaccination is certainly 
not intuitive. The narrative of 
illness prevention is largely based 
on avoiding germs, so the idea of 
having germs inserted into one’s 
body seems directly in opposition. 
Beyond active or inactive viral 
cultures, many other ingredients 
that compose vaccines do not 
merely seem scary — we have 
been warned to avoid them, 
notably 
formaldehyde 
and 
mercury-containing 
thimerosal. 
Of course, vaccines have been 
well established as scientifically 
and medically safe. But a mere 
statement of safety accompanied 
by absolute authority instead of 
understandable evidence can be 
intimidating and isolating rather 
than convincing.
Skepticism is largely treated as 
irrational and unreasonable, but 
this 
black-and-white 
response 
is incredibly invalidating and 
frustrating. 
Instead, 
patients 
should be treated as rational, 
capable of having reasonable 
concerns and discussions about 
the evidence behind vaccine safety. 
Reason is a far more effective 
response than resentment.
It 
is 
also 
important 
to 
acknowledge the emotions which 

accompany vaccination. These 
emotions 
may 
contribute 
to 
irrational thinking, but mitigating 
irrational 
responses 
are 
not 
always accomplished by outright 
ignoring such feelings. 
Often, the decision against 
vaccination is made by parents 
on behalf of their children, and 
many vaccines are scheduled 
for the first couple of months of 
life. Parents are tasked with the 
heavy responsibility of caring for 
this delicate, fragile new person, 
so 
it’s 
understandable 
that 
protective instincts may kick in 
at the thought of several massive 
needles containing viral cultures 
being injected into them.
YouTuber Unnatural Vegan 
summarizes this well, noting her 
own emotional response to her 
child’s vaccination — while her 
“rational” side knows vaccines are 
safe and necessary, her emotions 
did cause a moment of hesitation. 
For a new parent who doesn’t 
understand vaccination and has 
never seen the diseases they 
prevent, such emotions may 
cause an even more influential 
response. Instead of invalidating 
this emotional response, the 
focus should instead be on 
increasing understanding of the 
technology and the importance of 
vaccination.
Validate protective parental 
instincts, 
and 
channel 
them 
into protecting children from 
preventable and potentially deadly 
diseases. Instead of operating 
with absolute authority, treat 
parents as autonomous decision-
makers in their children’s health, 
supported by medicine rather 
than ruled by it.
Clearly, the bitter approach to 
the anti-vaccine is not the most 
effective one. Maybe it’s time to 
try employing a bit of sweetness 
instead. Maybe it’s a spoonful 
of compassion — rather than 
hatred — that we should utilize 
in the effort to quell the influence 
of the anti-vaccine movement. 
Vaccines 
absolutely 
are 
a 
revolutionary, 
priceless 
public 
health technology that should be 
embraced and utilized by as many 
people as possible.
Creating 
a 
more 
positive 
attitude toward vaccination will 
not be accomplished by fighting 
fire with fire — or by reacting 
to ambivalence with bitterness. 
Finding a smarter approach to 
this prickly subject is not just 
crucial for the health outcomes 
of individuals — it is a public 
health imperative.

A 
confused 
teenage 
girl 
sighs, “I think I might be 
broken.” Dr. Jean Milburn 
(Gillian 
Anderson, 
“The 
X-Files”) replies, “Sex doesn’t 
make us whole. So how could 
you be broken?” Though Dr. 
Milburn is speaking to one of 
the many students at Moordale 
Secondary School who comes 
to ask her advice, she’s really 
talking to you. This therapy 
session isn’t just for the sake 
of fiction. The message is clear 
and it’s meant for the viewing 
audience.
In the second season of 
Netflix’s 
“Sex 
Education,” 
sixteen-year-old 
Otis 
(Asa 
Butterfield, 
“The 
Space 
Between Us”) reopens his ‘sex 
advice clinic’ at his high school 
with his best friends Eric 
(Ncuti Gatwa, “Stonemouth”) 
and Maeve (Emma Mackey, 
“Badger Lane”). Business is 
booming, as an outbreak of 
chlamydia-based hysteria has 
wreaked havoc on the student 
population 
of 
Moordale. 
Despite 
the 
business’ 
success, Otis’ personal life 
is in shambles: Now dating 
classmate Ola (Patricia Allison, 
“Moving On”), Otis learns that 
his mother, Dr. Milburn, also 
happens to be dating Ola’s 
father. Realizing the poor sex-
ed curriculum is the culprit 
behind 
the 
community’s 
descent into chaos, the board 
hires Dr. Milburn to interview 
the student body in hopes of 
revising lessons to actually 

answer their most pressing 
questions. 
These first few episodes 
of the season capture what 
makes 
“Sex 
Education” 
so 
remarkable — sexuality has 
been ignored for so long by 
so many institutions that a 
whole town goes mad. In a high 
school that needs not one, but 
two 
relationship 
therapists, 
the 
deep-seated 
cultural 
issues surrounding sex are 

more present than ever. Every 
student that consults Otis or 
Dr. Milburn considers them a 
godsend, and with the school’s 
limited curriculum, it’s not 
hard to see why.
“Sex 
Education” 
takes 
place in a slightly fantastical 
midway between America and 
Britain and represents the 
most potent aspects of each 

country’s pop culture. A wide 
variety of races, ethnicities, 
genders, sexual orientations, 
religions, 
abilities 
and 
lifestyles are represented and 
united by their collective lack 
of representation in education 
and public awareness. Students 
struggle 
with 
unwanted 
pregnancies, confusion over 
sexual orientation, personal 
trauma and all the complex 
emotions 
that 
accompany 
the universal experience of 
growing up in 2020. 
Despite addressing mature 
topics and including explicit 
love scenes, “Sex Education” 
may be the most wholesome 
show on TV right now. Based 
entirely on the idea that talking 
about your problems will help 
you feel better, the show has 
become therapeutic for not 
only its characters but its 
audience as well. The conflicts 
of the story are resolved with 
honesty, empathy and clear 
communication. In a culture 
that emphasizes silence and 
shame in matters of sexuality, 
the 
refreshing 
notion 
that 
kindness and understanding 
can make a difference feels 
groundbreaking.
Of all the advice given in 
“Sex Education,” none of it 
is meant solely for the high 
school 
students 
or 
their 
clueless parents and teachers. 
Every second of the show is 
crafted to teach its audience 
that they’re okay. No one is 
truly abnormal. No one is truly 
broken. Sexuality is nothing to 
be afraid or ashamed of, and 
“Sex Education” is begging you 
to realize it. This education is 
for you, so you better take some 
good notes.

NETFLIX

ANYA SOLLER
Daily Arts Writer

“David died yesterday.”
This is the opening declaration 
of First Aid Kit’s single “Strange 
Beauty.” 
Whispered 
in 
soft, 
lilting 
undertones, as if a word spoken too 
harshly will break it, the opening 
of the song lulls the listener into 
hypnosis. The world keeps turning, 
the song keeps playing and First 
Aid Kit keeps singing. Then the 
dam breaks and reality crashes 
through –– “It’s left me gasping at 
the wheel.” One question lingers 
in the turbulence: “Oh, how can I 
explain the colossal loss I feel?” A 
line that hangs all at once heavy 
as a stone and light as a feather, 
suspended perpetually in the 
intangible cavern of song. It is only 
in the second verse that reality 
sets in –– Death has finally come 
to call. A parallel to the numbing 
shock of mourning, First Aid 
Kit’s “Strange Beauty” is a heart-
breaking, morbid tribute to loss.
The mysterious “David” whom 
First Aid Kit mourns in “Strange 
Beauty” and “Random Rules” is 
late musician David Berman, who 
passed away in August of 2019. 
“I think a lot of people were as 

shocked as I was upon hearing the 
news of David Berman’s passing,” 
Klara Söderberg, one of the 
Söderberg sisters, noted in a public 
statement. “It didn’t seem real. It 
left me completely devastated. So I 
wrote the song ‘Strange Beauty’ to 
try to make sense of my feelings.” 
There is something that rings 
fresh and raw in the crooning of 
First Aid Kit’s songs; something 
that, months later, still wears that 
stain of mourning. 
The two-track release functions 
as its own call and response. 
“Random Rules,” a cover from 
Berman’s band Silver Jews, is 
honest and vulnerable, a tribute 
to 
Berman’s 
memory. 
Where 
“Random Rules” looks for comfort 
in the past, “Strange Beauty” 
tackles the bleakness of the present 
and future. While each song can 
stand comfortably on its own, it 
feels like a betrayal to indulge 
in the grief of “Strange Beauty” 
in divorce with the heartfelt 
celebration of “Random Rules.”
“In 1984, I was hospitalized 
for approaching perfection,” First 
Aid Kit echoes in the opening 
lines of “Random Rules.” There 
is something painful, aching, in 
the chorus of “Strange Beauty”: 
“And when you are gone, the 
world it moves on / But it’s lost its 
strange beauty,” for the absence 

of 
Bernam’s 
self-proclaimed 
“perfection” has dulled the colors 
of the world –– at least, in the eyes 
of First Aid Kit.
But why do I feel the urge to 
return to the grim, rainy day of 
“Strange Beauty”? In part, it is 
the lingering resonance of grief, 
mourning and infantile blindness 
that permeates the song, and which 
strikes the heart so thoroughly. It is 
hard to forget the aching rhetoric 
of the Söderberg sisters. More so, 
it is the lack of acknowledgement 
for the track’s novelty that drives 
me to write about this single. The 
coverage of First Aid Kit’s tribute 
has been unforgivably shallow, 
concise and breezed over. In its 
coverage, “Strange Beauty” simply 
nods to an artist of obscurity, 
David Bernam; a quiet affirmation 
that First Aid Kit remains relevant 
and active in their music making, 
that they have not faded into the 
swirling pot of unknown names 
and inconsequential bands.
“Strange Beauty,” however, is 
more than Bernam, more than 
First Aid Kit and more than any 
throw-away filler piece to meet a 
deadline. “Strange Beauty” is grief 
put to words –– a miraculous feat, 
when grief so often loss robs us of 
our speech, cruelly infantilizing its 
victims with the crippling isolation 
of heartbreak. First Aid Kit offers 

us the gift of comprehension. 
Those familiar with mourning 
will recognize the solemn truth in 
these lyrics. Those that have never 
grieved have the chance to open 
a rare window into a soul at war 
with itself. 
The song is deceptive in its 
complexity. There is no overt 
ingenuity. No exotic metaphors, 
or winding prose. The words 
are simple, but the meaning is 
significant. “David died yesterday 
/ Today it’s raining,” the song 
begins with first steps, when grief 
descends and the world narrows to 
simple facts and straightforward 
acknowledgements of existence. 
This is the “drowning hour,” as 
poet Marian Lineaweaver writes 
in “My Son: Leavetaking.” Time 
suspends, and everything is new 
and unsure –– you reach for what 
you know. 
To be honest, my affection for 

this song comes from the striking 
parallel it holds with my own 
encounters with loss. “Oh it comes 
in waves, or a single tear,” the 
struggle to cope is a battle waged 
endlessly, hopelessly, and one I 
know all too well. The pain doesn’t 
fade, but there is something 
unquestionably validating in the 
words murmured in song that go 
straight to my heart. 
First Aid Kit is not the first to 
pen an open letter to grief, nor will 
they be the last. I could very well 
be deluding myself, too, that this 
song is any more special than the 
hundreds that have come before. 
Grief is a funny thing, found in 
strange places and things. For 
some, it might be a memory, a 
penny, a picture, an old shirt, or a 
song. But while “Strange Beauty” 
resonates with my own experience, 
I do not hold steadfast to its words 
because it holds a fading piece of 

who I’ve lost. Rather, because –– as 
I said before –- there is validation 
nestled within the chords, the 
sharp breaths and the lulls of 
this song. A validation in shared 
understanding. 
I will not strike of the pretence 
of defining another’s grief –– it 
is far too personal a journey for 
something so audacious. If nothing 
else, I hope that whoever reads this 
will come away with affirmation 
and recognition of their own 
grief, as I have. But I will be bold 
enough to argue that First Aid Kit 
got one thing soul-shatteringly 
right. When asked to explain what 
is most painful about grief, it is 
without doubt that “the world it’s 
lost its strange beauty.” From First 
Aid Kit I gained a sense of ease.

Beauty’: grief put to words

WIKIPEDIA

I think I heard about Joan 
Murray via an article in The New 
Yorker by Dan Chiasson. What 
jumped out at me was a poem short 
enough for him to quote in full: 
Three mountains high,
O you are a deep and marvelous 
blue.
It was with my palms
That I rounded out your slopes;
There was an easy calmness,
An irrelevant ease that touched me
And I stretched my arms and 
smoothed
Three mountains high.
I rarely remember in detail 
anything I read on the internet, 
but this poem stuck with me: it has 
a sort of slant symmetry to it, an 
incantatory quality, a mysterious 
momentum. I love that the word 
“irrelevant” is used instead of 
“irreverent,” 
and 
I 
love 
that 
calmness is modified with “easy.” 
The poem’s design is small even as 
its scale expands so that the speaker 
can hold mountains in her arms. It 
expanded in my mind after I read it, 
acquired a prismatic quality. I found 
a collection of her poems shortly 
after that.
She had a short, strange life. She 
was born in 1917 and died before 
her 25th birthday, leaving behind 
a body of work largely incomplete 
and 
fragmentary. 
Toward 
the 
end of her wayward, largely self-
directed education, Murray took a 
few classes in poetry from Auden 
at The New School and sought out 
his feedback. Before then, she had 
studied acting and dance, but it 
was her encounter with Auden that 
prompted her to focus on poetry 
and to produce most of her extant 
written work. Her mother blamed 
her death (from the heart condition 
she had since youth) on Auden, who 
had prompted her compositional 
mania. Grant Code, the editor who 
prepared her poems for posthumous 
publication, described her papers as 
“a confusion: pages of prose mixed 
with pages of verse and scarcely 
two pages of anything together 
that belonged together.” Her poetry 
existed at the time of her death in 
a stage of complete disarray, as it 
was largely all still in the process of 
being written and edited. 
The exuberance of this brief 
period of composition is palpable in 
the writing. There’s an unschooled 
sincerity, an absence of being 
weighed down by what came before 
her. It feels like she is perpetually 
stumbling on her own ability to 
send sparks flying. Her poetry finds 
unexpected connections between 

images, juxtapositions that have 
a mysterious, incantatory energy. 
It’s unsparingly sharp, with little 
connective tissue, jumping from 
vague impressions to deep feeling 
and back again. The strength of 
her images insists on meaning 
that must be disentangled from 
the surface texture, which is often 
grammatically 
ambiguous 
and 
sparsely punctuated. Take this 
untitled poem, which opens as 
follows: 
Instinct and sleep you are two 
passages that converge 
Two faces that stare and reflect 
back one vision 
The sea and the night both stir 
their profound surge 
Each shouldering the boundary of 
their prison.
A man who has raised the inhibited 
line of off horizon
Will stretch his thought to the 
beach where two converge.
The poem begins by setting 
up an opposition that wanders 
into a metaphor and runs with it, 
then introduces an inexplicable 
character, creating convolutions in 
its structures of meaning that aren’t 
entirely clear on the surface. It’s also 
possible that this first stanza is just 
the product of a wandering mind — 
the image of the sea simply letting 
sleep reverberate through it. She has 
this way of remaining declarative 
and knotty all at once, delivering 
ambiguities emphatically. 
She writes with themes in mind, 
though, themes that become more 
apparent the more one reads her. 
Her repository of images is more 
schematic than it appears at first, 
tending toward the Classic and 
pastoral. She frequently uses the 
image of small, insular groups of 
people, marriage, heady admiration 
and longing (which can bring 
Sappho to mind — she gets a 
mention in the poem “Ascetic: Time 
Misplaced”). She finds in water 
(especially the ocean) a metaphor 
for instinct and indeterminacy. The 
sea appears as a kind of Dionysian 
force, 
symbolizing 
intuition 
and 
sensuality 
alongside 
the 
immateriality and uncertainty of 
the mind. Just as frequently, the 
built environment stands in for 
human agency and ambition and 
all we want to accomplish in the 
world. These two opposing poles 
are frequently played off each other. 
In one of her only titled poems, “The 
Builder,” “the young of the people” 
insist that “it is the action of water 
that is the nearest thing to man.” 
They are rejoined to remain at 
their task — “We’re building towers 
of Babel that will crumble down 
before dawn.” The striking fourth 
stanza of the builder recounts an 
intense desire: “If there is sea I want 

to pack it up in my arms / And let 
the blue globe of all that water fill 
in my mouth / Rill up my head, my 
chest, burst out of the sullen seed of 
my loin.”
The built environment is a central 
concern of hers more generally. 
Buildings are the product of the 
mind that change their meaning 
by being lived in, a canny metaphor 
for cultural production and the 
weight of history. She has multiple 
poems that use an architect as 
a sort of archetypal figure. She 
frequently imagines her architect 
as “unemployed,” dreaming about 
possibility without being able to 
act. To me, this misses according 
with Ayn Rand if only because she 
devotes pages and pages of poetry 
to the lives of workers. She has 
poems that examine the builders 
who enact the designs of architects 
and devotes special attention to 
the small country houses she saw 
in Vermont. More anecdotally, 
Farnoosh Fathi, in her introduction 
to the 2017 NYRB edition of her 
poems, quotes her as once self-
describing as a “labor-unionist or 
communist” Joan of Arc, which 
is the kind of image that would 
sound ridiculous from anyone else 
but just about fits her. She makes a 
convincing mystic and has the same 
fervor.
Like Joan of Arc, Murray has a 
kind of lowercase “q” queerness 
about her, intimations that never 
really rise to the surface. She 
describes husbands hypothetically 
in her pastoral poems, but her 
own devotions, both in poetry 
and prose, are to other women. 
She has two poems, “Ego Alter 
Ego” and “On Dit!” that recount 
extended gazes on women, the 
former close by the sea (again), 
and the latter during a candlelit 
night. Fathi opens her selection of 
Murray’s correspondance with a 
jaw-dropping letter to the novelist 
Helen Anderson that opens with 
something that feels like erotic 
worship. “Dear Helen, I am held 
speechless in the hands of some 
spirit indefinite and prostrate. Oh, 
believe me, the nights slip an endless 
chain of thought to where the curve 
of your body and the subtle uplift of 
the neck and head are pillowed, and 
I may only dream that perhaps there 
is a traced loveliness that is your 
thought, lingering for a moment in 
the vacuum of a moment’s shadow 
or a moment’s life.” It’s possible that 
she means this in what is ultimately 
a chaste way, but it’s also undeniable 
that this breathless sentence speaks 
for itself. 

Declarative and knotty, all 
at once: On Joan Murray

Robert Downey Jr. (“Avengers: 
Endgame”) 
has 
had 
many 
successful movies over the years, 
despite personal difficulties that 
have arisen over the course of his 
career. Movies that he’s starred 
in, like “Iron Man,” “Zodiac” 
and “Chaplin,” are legendary 
pieces of work. Unfortunately, 
“Dolittle,” in which he plays the 
titular character, is not one of 
those stellar films that will go 
down in history. 
Downey 
himself 
isn’t 
particularly at fault for the 
movie’s flaws, with the exception 
of his accent that I, and everyone 
with whom I saw this film, 
could not place. Viewers have 
complained about the use of CGI 
and the differences between this 
rendition of Dr. Dolittle’s story 
and its predecessors, but the real 
problem with the film is the plot 
itself. 
The plot is extraordinarily 
predictable. Nearly all children’s 
movies are predictable of course, 
and 
typically 
I 
don’t 
mind 
because 
something 
usually 
makes up for it. Sometimes it’s 
songs that take my mind off 
the predictability or incredible 

animation 
that 
captures 
my 
attention. However, this film 
didn’t have anything to make up 
for its lackluster plot. 
John Dolittle is an animal 
doctor who loses his wife, cuts 
himself off from the human 
world, finds himself tasked with 
saving the queen, uses the help of 
a human boy and reconnects with 
his lost empathetic side ... end of 

story. You recognize the villains 
the second they appear on 
screen. You can tell that Stubbins 
(Harry Collett, “Dunkirk”), the 
boy Dolittle tries to push away, 
will be an important addition 
to the story from the moment 
Dolittle realizes he doesn’t want 
to be a hunter. 

You know that all the animals 
who cling to Dolittle for help 
will achieve some semblance of 
independence and confidence 
from the first scene in which they 
appear. There are no plot twists 
to keep you on the edge of your 
seat or even a single moment of 
real suspense. The fact that it’s a 
kid’s movie isn’t an excuse for a 
cut and dry story that leaves you 
unsatisfied and wanting more. 
The few good moments of the 
film, mostly humorous remarks 
from 
Plimpton 
the 
ostrich 
(Kumail Nanjiani, “The Big Sick”) 
and Kevin the squirrel (Craig 
Robinson, “This is the End”), 
while admittedly funny, were not 
enough to keep the movie afloat. 
There were too many poor scenes 
and moments that outnumbered 
the good few — with Dolittle 
extracting obstructions from a 
dragon’s intestines as probably 
the lowest, and most disturbing, 
part of the film. 
As much as I wanted to like 
this film and its all-star cast, 
I just couldn’t. While I’m sure 
kids who don’t look for much 
in movies beside some funny 
animals and colorful scenes 
will enjoy the film, most others 
probably won’t. It’s safe to say 
“Dolittle” is a movie that you 
can wait to watch on TV one day 
when you have nothing else to 
do, and maybe not even then.

‘Dolittle’ has little to offer

The Ark, home to nationally 
acclaimed folk and acoustic 
music, harbored an unusual 
guest on Tuesday, Jan. 14: G. 
Love and Special Sauce, an old 
school R&B group known for 
their laid-back and tastefully 
sloppy 
tunes. 
Instead 
of 
mandolins or acoustic guitars, 
the stage was filled with four 
different 
electric 
guitars, 
drums, electric basses, a tiny 
horn (I swear) and a slick 
harmonica. I felt like a bit of 
an interloper as I settled in 
amid a crowd that seemed to be 
entirely composed of people ten 
to fifteen years older than me.
The opener for G. Love 
— Shamarr Allen and the 
UnderDawgs — was insanely 
delightful. Allen blew onto 
the stage with vivacity, charm 
and openness. He and his band 
(featuring Allen on trumpet and 
vocals, Floyd Gray on the drums, 
Dan Cardillo on the guitar 
and Marius Tilton on the bass) 
exuded a casual, personable 
feel that made the listener feel 
like they were somewhere as 
intimate as a house concert. 
Allen played with good humor; 
at one point, he even asked for 
the house lights to come up so 
that he could see the audience 
dancing and dance with them. 
While 
Allen’s 
vocals 
worked well in service of his 
conversational and humorous 
lyrics, the highlight of the 
night was his horn playing. 
His horn solos ranged from 
the 
thundering 
largeness 
of an elephant’s cry to the 
intricate fluidity of the path of 
a bumblebee. It felt like horn 
playing was Allen’s way of 
rising above the restrictions of 
the human voice and expressing 
the essence of each song. After 
Allen’s 
set, 
the 
room 
was 

brimming with energy that 
could only be the result of his 
classic New Orleans hip-hop 
and youthful innovation. 
I was not prepared for what 
would happen when G. Love 
and his Special Sauce crew 
(featuring Garrett “G. Love” 
Dutton on main vocals, guitar, 
and harmonica, James “Jimi 
Jazz” Prescott on the bass and 
Jeffrey “Houseman” Clemens 
on the drums) rolled onstage 
in three different iterations of 
pink, black and white blazers. 
G. Love walked onto the stage 
with the subdued confidence of a 
seasoned performer. In contrast 
to Shamarr Allen’s energetic 
entrance and introduction, G. 
Love and Special Sauce slid into 
their first number as smoothly 

as one slips their hand into 
a glove. This cool entrance 
was met with an immediate 
standing 
ovation 
from 
the 
audience, and most of us didn’t 
sit down after this initial 
greeting. G. Love’s confident, 
energetic lyrics popped off 
the stage and into the ears of 
willing listeners, particularly 
“Shake Your Hair” from his 
new album. His rapport with 
the audience was that of a tired 
but giving star. He swayed over 
the audience, shaking the hands 

of as many people as he could 
and trying to give everyone a 
bit of his genuine gratitude. 
His voice seemed tired and a bit 
strained (as this was the middle 
of his tour), and because much 
of G. Love’s musicality rests in 
his snappy lyrics, my inability 
to hear them clearly muddled 
the quality of the performance. 
His energy was a bit low, but the 
audience never faltered in their 
support of him. 
The most extraordinary part 
of the concert, however, came 
when G. Love and Shamarr 
Allen came together for a 
rendition of Hall and Oates’ 
“I Can’t Go For That” and a 
collaborative version of Allen’s 
“Weekend 
Dance.” 
Allen’s 
newcomer energy mixed with 
G. Love’s complete ease blended 
with the audience’s support to 
create something incredible: 
a living time capsule. I looked 
onstage and saw two men truly 
in awe of the other’s musical 
talent — respect from Allen 
and excitement from G. Love. 
The two balanced each other 
out splendidly, portraying a 
successful 
mentorship 
that 
went beyond their friendship.
When 
looking 
around 
during this finale, I was filled 
with a sense of warmth and 
ease. 
An 
audience 
divided 
by 
generational 
differences 
was dancing ridiculously and 
blended seamlessly into one 
unified group of people. G. Love 
beamed onstage and I got the 
sense of him passing the baton 
of a genre he loves so dearly to 
Allen. As this thought danced 
into my head, I remembered 
something Allen said as he 
closed out his set:
“A lot of people ask me what 
genre my music is. Is it funk, 
R&B, soul or jazz? There’s so 
much in there. Well, I like to 
call it ‘bridge music’ because 
it bridges all kinds of music 
together. 
It 
bridges 
people 
together.”

VAN WYHE LEADS
MICHIGAN TO DOUBLE OT WIN 
OVER NO. 6 PENN STATE, ‘M’ 
TAKES 5 OF 6 POINTS ON THE 
WEEKEND

Alexis Rankin / Daily | Design by Jack Silberman

 UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Jacob Hay-
hurst slid into the slot and waited.
 The graduate transfer forward saw 
sophomore forward Nolan Moyle with 
the puck, and he knew he was wide 
open for a shot on net. Moyle sent a pass 
up to Hayhurst, who didn’t hesitate as 
he released a shot that cleanly beat Penn 
State goaltender Oskar Autio.
 Hayhurst’s goal — his third of the sea-
son, and just his second at even strength 
— tied Saturday’s game at three goals 
apiece in the third period. As soon as the 
puck hit the back of the net and the goal 
lamp lit up, he turned toward Michi-
gan’s bench, kicked his leg in the air and 
emphatically pumped his fists twice.
 It was a celebration that reflected the 
exorcism of some demons that have 
plagued Hayhurst this year. He’s caught 
the post numerous times in recent 
weeks — and Michigan coach Mel Pear-

son picked him up as a transfer because 
of his offensive ability.
 But Saturday night, he found the back 
of the net on the way to a 4-4 tie and the 
extra Big Ten point in double overtime 
for the Wolverines (10-11-3 overall, 5-7-2-
1 Big Ten) over No. 6 Penn State (16-7-1, 
8-5-1-0).
 “He makes things happen,” Pearson 
said. “He makes the players around 
him better. Plays on the right side of the 
puck. Good for him to get rewarded to-
night. He’s a grad senior. We expected 
more. … Sometimes I guess it’s not how 
you start, it’s how you finish.”
 Added Hayhurst: “It was really nice 
when you’re kind of battling back the 
entire game. To finally bring it back to 
even and get a little momentum with 
the team, I think it was awesome. I 
think that helped lead us to a victory in 
the end.”
 And while Hayhurst exorcised his of-
fensive demons, the Wolverines exor-
cised some of their own. They got into 

a 2-0 hole early in the second period 
and looked to be completely without 
momentum. Then slowly, they climbed 
back into contention.
 “Tonight, when it was 2-0, a lot of 
things were not going our way, and I 
think it was really important to stay 
within it,” Pearson said. “One shot. We 
talked about, ‘We’re one shot. We’re 
one shot away from getting back in the 
game.’ ”
 A goal from Moyle made it 2-1 barely a 
minute after the Nittany Lions made it 
2-0. Freshman forward Nick Granowicz 
made it 2-2 before the second period 
was over. Penn State came back to take 
the lead late in the period, but Michigan 
kept pressuring.
 Hayhurst tied things up six minutes 
into the third, and Granowicz tallied his 
second of the night to give the Wolver-
ines a 4-3 lead just a few minutes later. 
Michigan spent the rest of the third 
period shutting Penn State down to pre-
serve the lead.

 Then Nittany Lions pulled Autio for 
an extra attacker with two minutes left, 
and everything changed.
 Forward Evan Barratt fired a shot that 
beat sophomore goaltender Strauss 
Mann with just 1:22 left to play to tie the 
game and send it to overtime.
 “The only disappointing thing, though, 
tonight, was we had the lead,” Pearson 
said. “We had the lead and they scored 
the extra-man goal.”
 But with 12 seconds left in three-on-
three double overtime, sophomore for-
ward Garrett Van Wyhe found the puck 
on his stick with no one in front of him.
 His wrister flipped up over Autio’s 
shoulder, and while the rest of the build-
ing went silent, there was an explosion 
on Michigan’s bench. The goal exor-
cised the demons of close but not quite, 
of being right there and just missing.
 The roar was somehow almost louder 
than the whole Penn State crowd put to-
gether. It was the roar of a team, finally 
putting it all together.

 All of a sudden, Michigan has become 
the kind of team that can go play road 
series at ranked teams two weekends 
in a row and take 11 of the 12 possible 
points. All of a sudden, the Wolverines 
have put themselves back in the conver-
sation for home ice in the Big Ten tour-
nament.
 Their early struggles keep them out of 
the NCAA Tournament conversation, at 
least for an at-large bid. A Big Ten Tour-
nament title and an autobid is a long 
way away at this point, but it’s starting 
to seem possible in a way it didn’t in No-
vember.
 “We had a lot of breaks go against 
us, but now we’re finding ways to win 
games. Earlier we were finding a way 
to lose games,” Pearson said. “This team 
has really come together, and that’s ex-
citing to see.
 “As a coach, it’s almost to the point 
where you just let them go and stay out 
of the way, because they’re pulling the 
train right now.”

GAME 2: MICH 4, PSU 4 (20T, WIN)

T

he couch is taken, so 
Carol Hutchins pulls 
an ottoman out from 
under a table. Practice ran long, 
so she’s running late. There is 
little time for 
small talk.
“What can 
I do for you?” 
she asks.
She is 
here, in a 
team meet-
ing room at 
the Donald 
R. Shepherd 
Softball 
Center, to 
talk about program-building, 
a subject on which Hutchins 
is one of the foremost experts 
in America. She’s the all-time 
winningest softball coach in 
Division I, with 21 Big Ten reg-
ular season titles, 12 Women’s 
College World Series appear-
ances and a national title to her 
name.
Thirty-five years into her 
reign, Hutchins is Michigan 
softball, and Michigan softball 
is her. 
One day prior to this con-
versation with Hutchins, Tim 
Corbin ran late, too. A meet-
ing with his athletic director. 
He missed the first phone call 
from The Daily and apologized.
Corbin coaches baseball at 
Vanderbilt, where he won his 
second College World Series 
title last June, beating Michi-
gan in three games. Before 
Corbin got to Nashville in 2003, 
the Commodores had last been 
to the College World Series in 
1980. They are now the peren-
nial power in college baseball. 
Corbin, too, is a program-
builder.
The two have that in com-
mon, along with proximity to 
Bakich. Hutchins works right 
by him — the baseball and soft-
ball programs share the Wilpon 
complex at Michigan — and 
Corbin was his boss for seven 
seasons at Vanderbilt. This 

matters because Bakich is on 
the cusp. Not a clichéd, start-
of-the-season on the cusp. Past 
that. 
The breakthrough — last 
season’s out-of-nowhere ride to 
Omaha, to the College World 
Series, to the final, to the last 
game — is now in the rearview 
mirror. It’s about sustainability 
now. What happens after you 
catch lightning in a bottle?
“I think maintaining consis-
tency is very, very difficult,” 
Corbin said. “And it’s a con-
tinuing education. No one has 
that figured out.”
Michigan must now deal 
with all the same obstacles — 
roster turnover, a biting cold, a 
schedule that sees the Wolver-
ines go on the road for the first 
month of the season — with 
the added weight of expec-

tation. Collegiate Baseball 
ranked the Wolverines 10th 
in its preseason poll, Baseball 
America ranked them eighth 
and D1Baseball 
had them at 
13th. News out-
lets will devote 
resources to 
covering them. 
They will be 
on television. 
Bakich will be 
pulled in every 
direction, all 
of them away 
from his pro-
gram and his 
family.
On the first day of fall prac-
tice leading into the 2006 
season, coming off a national 
title in 2005, Hutchins was 
told she had to go to the state 

capitol in Lansing. The team 
was scheduled to meet the gov-
ernor. She didn’t understand. 
They’d already been to the 
White House. 
“But I couldn’t 
tell the president 
of the University 
no,” she said. “So 
off we — we had 
to miss practice.” 
She’s still miffed.
“You feel it 
everywhere,” 
Corbin said. 
“You feel it from 
a responsibil-
ity standpoint. I 
know Erik felt it. I’m sure his 
year was unlike any other year 
you felt on Earth. 
“I’m sure when you get to 
the College World Series and 
you get to the final game, all 

of the sudden you’ve gotten 
smarter and you’ve got more 
knowing and you’re more, in 
some people’s eyes, more an 
authoritarian on certain things. 
‘Let’s get this guy to speak. 
They just went to the College 
World Series, let’s hear from 
him.’ And not that you are (dif-
ferent), you’re still the same 
person, but there’s an expecta-
tion level of what you know and 
how you can present and what 
you do.”
There are some perks to suc-
cess, too. Bakich told reporters 
after the College World Series 
that he was eager to discuss 
potential facilities upgrades 
with athletic director Warde 
Manuel. It’s easier to have 
those discussions once you’ve 
proven you’re worth the invest-
ment. The roster returns much, 

though not all, of its core. They 
can take last year’s experience 
with them into this season (and 
so can the coaching staff). As a 
program, people won’t dismiss 
Michigan simply because of the 
cold weather. Doors will open 
in recruiting.
None of those rules are iron-
clad. The slope of an upward 
trajectory is usually not linear. 
But?
“You can walk in the living 
room and say, ‘This is a pro-
gram you can have a chance 
to go to the World Series,’ ” 
Hutchins said.
After Hutchins’ first Wom-
en’s College World Series in 
1995, Michigan made it for the 
next three years in a row, and 
seven of the next 10, culminat-
ing in Samantha Findlay’s go-
ahead 10th-inning home run 
against UCLA to give the Wol-
verines a national title.
Hutchins started to notice 
then that her schedule was 
getting tighter. Speaking 
engagements and glad-handing. 
“Distractions,” she says now. 
“... Best word I ever learned: 
No.”
Fifteen years into being a 
known commodity, Hutchins 
knows her energy is limited. 
Once January hits, she rarely 
says yes. Corbin thinks of these 
engagements in terms of how 
it can help his program. If it 
can’t, he’ll pass.
“But there’s a part of you, 
too, that wants to get yourself 
out there so people are attract-
ed to you and your program,” 
Corbin said. “And that takes 
time.”
As for Bakich? His philoso-
phy on the subject is unclear. 
He couldn’t be interviewed for 
this story, though Michigan 
baseball’s prep work starts in 
full next week.
He’s been on a speaking cir-
cuit.

Bakich, Hutchins and the challenge of sustaining success

Simpson gets to second on assist list

IOWA 
CITY 
— 
Zavier 
Simpson crossed midcourt and 
whipped a pass from the top 
of the key to the corner, as he’s 
done countless times before.
With the Michigan men’s 
basketball team trailing by 
six with 13 minutes to play at 
Carver-Hawkeye 
Arena, 
the 
senior point guard found an 
open Eli Brooks on the other 
end of his missile.
The junior guard checked 
his feet before pulling up and 
draining 
the 
three, 
giving 
Simpson career assist No. 576. 
With it, he passed Rumeal 
Robinson (1988-90) for second-
most in program history.
When 
junior 
walk-on 
forward C.J. Baird was asked 
about 
Simpson’s 
ascension 
through 
Michigan’s 
record 
book on Thursday, he didn’t 
even know the number. It’s 
gotten that high. Now in his 
third year playing alongside 
Simpson, 
Baird 
has 
grown 
accustomed to exactly this.
“That speaks to (Simpson’s) 
feel 
for 
the 
game 
and 
understanding 
of 
his 
teammates,” Baird said. “ … He 
knows what we’re going to do 

before we do it.”
Simpson 
entered 
Friday 
night’s game leading the nation 
with 142 assists — over 30 more 
than the next highest total. 
He’s on pace for a hair over 
275 assists, which would break 
the 
program’s 
single-season 
record of 260. Trey Burke set 
that record in 2012-13 en route 
to claiming Naismith College 
Player of the Year honors.
With Simpson, though, it 
boils down to preparation.
“Most times when I walk in, 
(Simpson) is doing some sort 
of workout,” Baird said. “ … 
What he does is he works on a 
lot of game situations and stuff 
like that in his workouts. It’s 
working out with a purpose, 
working out smart, as we like 
to say. … He’s working on stuff 
he will see in a game and stuff 
he has seen in the past so he can 
hone his craft.”
When Simpson first began 
his 
climb 
on 
Michigan’s 
assists list, the likes of Moritz 
Wagner, 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman and Duncan 
Robinson were on the receiving 
end of his passes. Since taking 
over the starting point guard 
role 
halfway 
through 
his 
sophomore year, he’s proved 
capable of creating passing 

angles under almost any set of 
circumstances.
To first-year coach Juwan 
Howard, that value can’t be 
overstated.
“He’s one of the best players 
in the country and one of the 
best point guards there is,” 
Howard said Thursday. “He’s a 
smart, crafty guard who knows 
how to take advantage of a 
defense. He’s great at reading 
ball screens, he’s great at 
reading coverages overall. He 
wants to make the right play to 
put us in a position to score.
“There are times he makes 
mistakes like any player, but I’m 
just so happy he’s playing for 
us. I knew before I took the job 
that I was getting a point guard 
who’s one of the best point 
guards in NCAA basketball.”
With Robinson now in the 
rearview mirror, Simpson trails 
only Gary Grant (731) in career 
assists — a record set in 1988. 
Should Michigan play 20 more 
games this season — a number 
that hinges on the Wolverines’ 
postseason fate — it’d take 
about about eight assists per 
game to dethrone Grant.
And if anyone is up for 
the challenge, it’s the player 
Howard so often refers to as his 
“Tom Brady.”

‘M’ looking to replace star duo

Kate Fahey sits atop the 
Michigan women’s tennis all-
time wins list. Brienne Minor 
follows 
closely 
behind 
at 
spot No. 7. Minor is the only 
Wolverine in team history to be 
a four-time ITA All-American, 
while 
Fahey 
owns 
an 
impressive three All-America 
honors. Each player has a set 
of accomplishments that reads 
like a phone book, and they 
earned them simultaneously. 
The duo even paired up to 
reach the 2019 NCAA Doubles 
National Championship.
But now, both are gone.
Recognizing 
that 
Fahey 
and Minor are no longer with 
the program, Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein doesn’t hide 
her feelings.
“I’m still crying,” Bernstein 
said. “It’s rough.”
But no authority can grant 
Fahey or Minor an additional 
year of eligibility, so what 
comes next?
“You need people to step 
up,” Bernstein answered.
Thankfully 
for 
Bernstein 
and the No. 14 Wolverines, 
both 
new 
and 
returning 
players 
inspired confidence 
that they will be able to fill the 

void left by Fahey and Minor 
with impressive performances 
against No. 22 Ohio State, 
No. 25 Tennessee and Texas 
Christian in the non-scored 
Michigan 
Invitational 
this 
past weekend. 
“You 
hope 
your 
seniors 
become the leaders and your 
strongest players,” Bernstein 
said. 
No. 26 senior Giulia Pairone 
appeared poised to do just that 
on Sunday as she defeated TCU 
junior Stevie Kennedy in three 
sets (5-7, 6-2, 6-0). Pairone 
admitted that she was trying 
to force too many shots early 
on, but she took over the match 
as it moved to the second set 
and improved until she looked 
dominant in the third set. 
“I don’t think she played 
her best in the first set,” 
Bernstein said. “But that level 
at the end of the third set was 
unbelievable, actually. 
“She is, I think, one of the 
best players in college tennis if 
she can hold that level.” 
And 
while 
the 
current 
class of seniors are the most 
logical 
replacements 
for 
players like Fahey and Minor, 
Bernstein also underscores the 
importance of contributions 
from underclassmen in such an 
effort. 

That task will fall in part to 
freshman Nicole Hammond, 
who went 1-1 on the weekend 
against 
more 
experienced 
competition. In doing so, she 
showed an ability to play at a 
high level and earned praise 
from her coach.
“I think she’s going to play 
a lot,” Bernstein said. “She’s 
very good when she’s good, 
she plays at a really high level, 
and I’m looking for her to 
contribute a lot and have a big 
impact.”
Bernstein has very similar 
expectations for Hammond’s 
fellow 
freshman, 
No. 
85 
Andrea Cerdan. The ability 
to have these expectations

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — 
Mel Pearson stopped midway 
through his answer.
He 
bounced 
his 
foot 
on 
the press conference stage a 
few times. Then he blinked 
hard. He had just been asked 
about freshman forward Nick 
Granowicz, and his performance 
in Saturday night’s game.
“He’s 
been 
really 
good,” 
Pearson said. “He’s been really 
good on the road.”
Just 
moments 
earlier, 
Granowicz had skated off the ice 
after an incredible performance. 
He was responsible for two of 
Michigan’s four goals in a come-
from-behind 4-4 tie with Penn 
State that saw Garrett Van Wyhe 
give the Wolverines an extra 
point with a double-overtime 
winner. But that was only part 
of what had Pearson feeling so 
sentimental. The other half was 
Granowicz’s late mother, Valerie. 
Saturday night would have been 
her 53rd birthday.
And 
the 
number 
71 
embroidered on the back and 
arms 
of 
Granowicz’s 
jersey 
is a tribute to her and his 
father, Dennis. Valerie’s birth 
year is 1967 and Dennis’ is 
1971. Granowicz’s number is 
combination of the two years, the 
seven from his mother and the 
one from his father.
This summer, Valerie passed 
away. And coping with that loss, 
on top of starting college was 
difficult for Granowicz. He had 
responsibilities to take care of at 
home, like Dennis and his sister. 
So when he arrived on campus 
in the fall, he wasn’t in quite as 
good of shape as his teammates.
Granowicz knew it, but he 
wasn’t discouraged.
Instead, he used it as a source 
of motivation. He poured in extra 
hours working and training. 
He stayed focused, and most 
importantly — he stayed positive.

“I’m a strong believer that 
everything stems from hard 
work,” Granowicz said. “I just 
wanted to be prepared for my 
opportunities and for when the 
coaching staff felt comfortable 
putting me in. Basically just 
working on my game, working 
hard and preparing. Hoping it 
would pay off, it’s going good so 
far.”
In the very beginning of the 
season, his opportunities to 
make an impact were limited. 
His hard work wasn’t being 
rewarded. That’s why the path 
to his performance Saturday 
night was anything but linear. 
Granowicz didn’t even crack a 
lineup until Nov. 2 against Ohio 
State. He never saw consistent 
minutes. He played in one game 
of every weekend series except 
against New Hampshire, where 
he sat out both nights.
And along the way, there were 
setbacks — like the game against 
Wisconsin. Granowicz took a 
penalty in the final five minutes 
of the game for roughing. The 
Badgers converted on the power 
play opportunity to cut the 
Wolverines’ lead. His penalty 

ultimately didn’t end up costing 
his team the game, but Pearson 
didn’t play him the remaining 
minutes once he left the box.
But again, rather than looking 
at the negative side, Granowicz 
took that moment as a learning 
opportunity. 
His 
emotions 
needed to be managed.
That game Pearson realized 
something 
too. 
Granowicz 
deserved more opportunities. 
The coaches weren’t playing him 
enough.
Last weekend, that changed. 
Against then-No. 14 Notre Dame, 
he showed exactly the types of 
big plays he’s capable of making. 
Granowicz proved himself. He 
also netted his first career goal 
when a puck deflected off his 
head in the Wolverines’ 3-0 
victory.
But Saturday night at Pegula 
Ice 
Arena, 
his 
performance 
meant something bigger.
Granowicz’s first goal of the 
game came from a deflection off 
his body. He’d seen freshman 
forward 
Johnny 
Beecher 
cutting towards the crease and 
remembered a piece of advice 
he’d been given — if you want 

to score goals, go to the net. So 
Granowicz crashed towards the 
net and when the play was over, 
the hard work paid off for him. 
He’d tied the game.
“I’ve been getting a lot of 
opportunities,” Granowicz said. 
“I just wanted to capitalize on 
those. Score some goals. Help the 
team out. Help them win.”
But he wasn’t satisfied, he still 
hadn’t scored a goal with his 
stick. Almost 20 minutes later, 
Granowicz accomplished that 
feat. He was positioned on the 
right side of the crease when 
the puck made its way to him. 
Without hesitation and as though 
he’d done it a million times 
before, Granowicz sent a quick 
release into the back of the net.
He lifted one leg off the ice, 
waved his stick in the air and 
skated toward the Michigan 
bench in celebration. This time, 
he’d given his team the lead.
“It 
was 
very 
special,” 
Granowicz 
said. 
“It 
was 
obviously my mom’s birthday, 
God bless her heart. I think she 
was with me tonight. It’s more 
motivation to have a good game 
tonight and win. It was so big.”

Wolverines vault to 
tight win over Illinois

Swarms 
of 
Illini-orange 
filled the bleachers next to 
sophomore Abby Heiskell as 
she swung between uneven 
bars. Suspended in the air, 
she twisted gracefully on the 
bar. Heiskell set the standard 
scoring a 9.875, winning her 
first collegiate event. 
As the event went on, the 
crowd fell quiet as the No. 16 
Wolverines 
(3-0-0 
overall, 
1-0-0 Big Ten) defeated No. 13 
Illinois (4-1-0 overall, 0-1-0 Big 
Ten), 196.700-195.650, Saturday 
at Huff Hall. 
The meet started off on a 
high for Michigan. Switching 
between 
bars, 
Heiskell 
showed focus and dedication 
throughout. But, it all came 
down to the finish as she ended 
with a double backflip and a 
perfect landing. Her teammates 
flooded the mat, congratulating 
Heiskell for the achievement. 
The Wolverines ended with 
a 49.225 on uneven bars, and 
Heiskell was the top scorer. 
Next, Michigan rotated to 
the vault. Freshman Nicoletta 
Koulos led the order. Making 
her freshman debut, she scored 
a 9.775. 
“I think Nicoletta Koulos is 
going to be a young woman who 
is going to continue to grow into 
her role in this team,” Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki said. “She 
has a lot in the tank. For her 
first time out on vault floor, I 
thought she did really well. I 
expect continued growth.”
Sophomore Natalie Wojcik 
and freshman Sierra Brooks 
both followed with scores of 
9.850. Freshman Gabby Wilson 
ended the rotation with a 
score of 9.875 and finished 
on top for the second week in 
a row. Twirling through the 
air and landing precisely, the 

Wolverines 
rushed 
towards 
Wilson as the Fighting Illini 
turned their backs in the midst 
of Michigan’s domination. The 
Wolverines’ vault score ended 
up as a 49.175. 
“The events we did really well 
on we want to try to replicate,” 
Plocki said. “The events that we 
needed to improve on we want 
to improve. We weren’t quite 
as sharp on vault. We were far 
better on beam and floor.”
When it came to the floor 
lineup, Brooks finished with a 
9.900 — the highest score of the 
day. The five other Wolverines 
performed well enough for 
them to end with a final score 
of 49.175. Afterwards, Brooks 
was at it again, scoring a 9.900 
on the beam, while senior Lexi 
Funk followed with another 
9.900. Michigan finished beam 
with a score of 49.125. With 
their final round of the meet 
completed, 
the 
Wolverines 
looked 
to 
the 
scoreboard. 
They’d earned a final score of 
196.700 and gathered arm in 
arm in celebration.
“We want to have fun,” 
Plocki said. “We want to lock 
in. Our focus is on us. We want 
to continue to improve from one 
meet to the next.”
During her 30-year career 
at Michigan, Plocki has won 
24 Big Ten titles, holds the 
record for most Big Ten titles 
by any coach in any sport and 
has created a powerhouse at 
Michigan that attracts the best 
female gymnasts across the 
country. Her expectations are 
only heightened as the years go 
on. To Plocki, titles are not only 
an expectation, but a necessity. 
“We’ve 
always 
had 
the 
expectation to win the Big Ten 
and making it from regionals 
to nationals,” Plocki said. “The 
goal is trying to be in the NCAA 
finals at the end of the year.”

Free throws spur Nebraska past ‘M’

Somehow, 
some 
way, 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team could still win. Senior 
forward Hailey Brown had made 
two improbable 3-pointers in a 
row, in the face of a defender, to 
claw the Wolverines back within 
three, with possession and eight 
seconds left.
Freshman 
guard 
Maddie 
Nolan took the inbound, finding 
sophomore forward Naz Hillmon 
with her back to the basket. 
Hillmon pump-faked a couple 
times, the play busted, before 
dishing it out to sophomore 
Danielle 
Rauch. 
Rauch, 
the 
seconds dwindling, gave it to 
sophomore forward Emily Kiser 
— her shot, awkward from the 
start, a mile wide.
Nolan gathered it under the 
basket, though, sprinting to the 
corner and sent one last prayer up 
as the buzzer sounded.
It wasn’t answered, and the 
Wolverines (12-6 overall, 3-4 Big 
Ten) fell to Nebraska (14-4, 4-3) 
on Sunday, 74-71.
The Cornhuskers stormed back 
from a 13-point deficit early in 
the third quarter, attacking the 
3-point line and the free throw 
line, two patterns that became 
clear on their first possession 
when senior Hannah Whitish 
watched her 3-pointer bounce 

around the rim and fall down. 
Whitish 
didn’t 
slow 
down, 
shooting 
6-for-8 
from 
three 
and giving Michigan’s defense 
nightmares.
Yet, unlike in previous games 
when an opposing hooter caught 
fire from long, the Wolverines 
answered with Brown, who shot 
83.3 percent from three. Nolan, 
Rauch and Kiser each added their 
own and Michigan shot over 50 
percent from beyond the arc.
The Wolverines had no answer 
for Nebraska at the line, who 
cashed in — shooting 20-for-24 
from the charity stripe.
“I feel like things didn’t go 
our way,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “I don’t know 
if that was an officiating thing or 
what, but we couldn’t get a call 
down the stretch and it seemed 
like they got the whistles down 
the stretch. They got to the free 
throw line both in the third and 
fourth quarter, which was a really 
different swing than in the first 
half.
“(The calls) took us out of what 
we were doing and changed the 
momentum. They seemed to 
be more of the aggressor in the 
second half.”
Worn 
down 
by 
fouls, 
sophomore guard Amy Dilk left 
the game with five fouls late in the 
fourth quarter after landing on a 
Nebraska player late in the shot 
clock. Brown, after making two 

clutch threes, used her final foul 
to save time on the clock.
The Wolverines were forced 
to go to their bench for big 
points, and for the most part it 
contributed.
After senior forward Kayla 
Robbins suffered a non-contact 
knee injury just over a minute 
into the game, Rauch came in to 
replace her — playing a season 
high 31 minutes. Nolan, coming on 
late in with eight seconds left in 
the first quarter nailed a buzzer-
beater 3-pointer, going on to play 
15 minutes throughout the game.
To start the second quarter, 
senior guard Akienreh Johnson 
was the only starter on the court. 
In five minutes, freshman center 
Izabel Varejão scored eight points 
and Michigan maintained a solid 
lead.
A weakness for the team to 
start Big Ten play showed it 
wasn’t one.
“I thought they were great, 
I thought Danielle Rauch was 
outstanding,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She did a really good job, Maddie 
Nolan gave us some good minutes 
for sure. Our bench is definitely 
going to have to step up and really 
help us with having Kayla out.”
But as the clock wound down 
and the Wolverines needed a 
clutch shot, their starters weren’t 
there to provide one. Their 
experience sat on the bench, 
watching.

Wolverines go 2-2 in UCSB Invite

It was a chance to measure 
up with some of the nation’s 
toughest competition as the 
No. 7 Michigan water polo 
team (2-2) kicked off its season 
in the UCSB Invitational over 
the weekend. The Wolverines 
captured victories over No. 22 
Cal State Northridge (2-2) and 
No. 11 UC Santa Barbara (3-2), 
but suffered tough losses to No. 
4 California (3-2) and No. 5 UC 
Irvine (2-0).
“I think this was a great 
gauge for us,” Michigan coach 
Marcelo Leonardi said. “It’s one 
of the toughest first weekends 
I think we’ve played since I’ve 
been here at Michigan.”

Despite 
the 
2-2 
finish, 
the 
Wolverines 
gained 
valuable experience from the 
tournament. Leonardi said one 
of his concerns going in was 
“the amount of youth” they 
had on the team. His worries 
were eased as freshman utility 
player Anne Rankin scored 
four goals and had three assists 
and sophomore attacker Ava 
Morrant poured in seven goals 
over the course of the weekend. 
The strongest showing from 
Michigan came in a losing 
effort to the Golden Bears. The 
Wolverines came out of the 
gate hot and held a 5-2 lead at 

the half. California rallied back 
with three unanswered goals 
to tie it in the third quarter. In 
a back and forth final frame, 
Michigan 
surrendered 
the 
game-winning goal with just 
seconds remaining to lose, 8-7. 
Despite the heartbreaking loss, 
the Wolverines came away 
from the game feeling good 
about their performance. 
“It’s 
a 
good 
confidence 
booster that we’re able to be 
that close with the top four the 
first weekend of the season,” 
senior goalie Heidi Ritner said. 
“Especially 
when 
you’re 
young, you gotta learn how to 
lose close games,” Leonardi 
said. He believes his team can 
grow from the loss to one of the 
nation’s best teams. 
The growth was already 
apparent in the final game 
of the weekend against the 
Gouchos. The Wolverines won, 
9-7, in a game they controlled 
from the start. 
“The 
momentum 
carried 
over to the Santa Barbara 
game,” Leonardi said. “We had 
a great start and we kind of 
learned how (to) finish.”
A 
standout 
offensive 
performance came from junior 
attacker Maddie O’Reilly, who 
had six goals and five assists in 
the tournament. After a slow 
start, she turned it up as the 
games went on and closed out 

the final game with three goals 
against UC Santa Barbara.
“She got hot at the right 
situation,” Leonardi said. “She 
hit some pretty clutch shots.”
On the other side of the ball, 
Ritner was solid defending the 
goal, accruing seven steals. 
She also helped secure the win 
against the Gauchos with two 
penalty shot saves. Leonardi 
liked what he saw from the 
captain — not just from her play 
— but from her leadership.
“(She was) not only making 
saves, but just being a presence 
(from) the cage, being vocal,” 
Leonardi said. 
Ritner 
was 
proud 
of 
Michigan’s achievements and 
felt good about the future of 
the team. “I think that this is 
the strongest we’ve ever been 
this early in the season,” she 
said. 
The Wolverines are oozing 
confidence after holding their 
own against some of the best 
water polo teams on the West 
Coast. 
Michigan 
has 
lofty 
goals for the season and the 
key to success may not be 
their performance in the pool, 
but their mentality moving 
forward. 
“I feel that if we set some 
expectations 
like 
reaching 
a final four,” Leonardi said. 
“(Then) I think that’s in our 
wheelhouse.”

In Wagner’s 
eyes, slump 
boils down 
to emotion

IOWA CITY — To Franz Wagner, the 
most pressing issue for the Michigan 
men’s basketball team is simple.
It isn’t hapless interior defense, nor is 
it a winless road record. You can cross 
the team’s lack of free throws off the 
list, too. Really, it doesn’t have anything 
to do with the physical demands of 
college basketball.
Leaning against the wall of a narrow 
corridor in Carver-Hawkeye Arena 
after the Wolverines’ third loss in 
four games, the freshman wing put it 
bluntly.
“I think (emotion) is something that 
we need, something that we lost during 
the course of the season,” Wagner said. 
“We need to show more emotion, just 
within the team (to) show emotion and 
show that we’re motivated; and that 
we’re not just playing out there, we’re 
playing to win the game.”
On Friday night, Iowa City became 
the latest Big Ten destination Michigan 
left empty-handed. After beating Iowa 
by double-digits in December, the 
Wolverines saw a seven-point lead slip 
away as the Hawkeyes closed the game 
on a 25-11 run over the final ten minutes. 
When the dust settled, Michigan was 
staring at a 90-83 loss.
Throughout the second half, Wagner 
did his best to will his team across the 
finish line. He scored 13 second-half 
points and added three rebounds — 
both team-highs. Much of his game is 
rooted in emotion, which he didn’t shy 
away from against Iowa.
“When we play, we talk about not just 
competing, but play to win,” Wagner 
said. “When somebody says something 
on the court from the other team, don’t 
step back. Hold your ground, maybe say 
something back.
“I think that’s part of the game. 
You’re confident in yourself, you’re 
trying to win and you’re trying to stand 
up for your team.”
And on Friday night, there were 
moments when Michigan did exactly 
that. When coach Juwan Howard was 
hit with a technical foul, the Wolverines 
responded with a 14-2 run.

During that run, there was an 
instance when Michigan’s fastbreak 
drive was stopped at the elbow. Trailing 
behind the ball-handler, though, was 
Wagner. Just when it looked like the 
breakaway was dead, he caught the 
ball on the left wing and let it fly from 
behind the arc before Iowa could set up 
its defense.
He began celebrating even before it 
went in.
Now, the task at hand revolves around 
finding ways to apply that confidence to 
the whole team for an entire game.
“You can see when you look at the 
film that during a couple stretches, we 
had everyone involved,” Wagner said. 
“Everybody (was) super motivated and 
just locked in. When you’re passionate 
about the game, that’s when emotion 
comes out like that.”
That kind of emotion is exactly 
what the Wolverines have struggled to 
sustain for long stretches this season. 
The last time they did, they knocked off 
North Carolina and now-No. 1 Gonzaga 
on back-to-back afternoons at the Battle 
4 Atlantis in November.
“When you look at the Bahamas, 
how we played there, you can see we 
played (with) great togetherness, people 
picking each other up,” Wagner said. 
“I think we need to get back to that. … 
That’s part of our process right now.”
Michigan, which has now lost all 
five of its true road games, hasn’t found 
ways to capture the lightning in a bottle 
in enemy territory. In three of their four 
conference road losses, the Wolverines 
have trailed by fewer than five points 
with under three minutes to play.
As the sense of urgency grows, 
the energy Michigan so badly craves 
becomes most elusive.
And as a result, Friday night’s game 
can be defined by the amount of time 
the Wolverines spent searching for that 
emotion — not the amount of time they 
spent playing with it.

IOWA CITY — In a slugfest 
complete with an eyebrow-raising 
foul differential, a litany of 3-point 
shots 
and 
the 
back-and-forth 
action one hopes for when buying a 
basketball ticket, Michigan came up 
just short.
Despite their most valiant efforts, 
the Wolverines (11-6 overall, 2-4 
Big Ten), dogged by foul trouble 
to key players in the post, fell just 
shy of completing one of the most 
improbable comebacks the team has 
seen this season, 90-83, at Iowa on 
Friday.
The Hawkeyes (13-6, 4-3) were 
just a little more efficient in the 
matchup. In the post. From beyond 
the 3-point arc. Distributing the 
ball.
Add on an astounding 23-13 foul 
difference, sending Iowa to the 
line to shoot 30 free throws, and 
you have a pretty great recipe for a 
victory. And when the Hawkeyes 
needed the big plays, they got them, 
walking away with a home victory.
Michigan coach Juwan Howard 
was livid at the prospect of his guys 
getting whistled for seemingly every 
movement under the basket. So 
much so that the first-year coach got 
called for a technical in the second 
half, his second of the year.
“Yes, 
yes, 
it 
is,” 
Howard 
answered when asked whether the 
foul differential was frustrating. 
“That was a big reason why I got 
a tech, because I was very upset. 
Unfortunately, I gave two points at 
the free throw line, so I can add to 
the free throws.”
Prior to any emotive outbursts 
from Howard, at the onset, Michigan 
started hot from the floor just to see 

Iowa respond by screaming to life on 
its home court.
If you’re a Michigan basketball 
fan, and you’re thinking of recent 
matchups against teams in black and 
yellow, you probably put money on 
one man putting up big numbers — 
Hawkeyes center Luka Garza. 
And 
the 
big 
man 
did 
not 
disappoint. After dropping 44 points 
in round one of this prizefight, Garza 
followed that up by notching 33 on 
Friday. This time, 11 of those would 
come from the free-throw line.
Iowa found production from all 
over its roster, getting the crowd 
involved early and leaving scorch 
marks behind the 3-point line.
But Michigan would not go 
quietly into that goodnight.
With senior guard Zavier Simpson 
in foul trouble early, the Wolverines 
knew they were going to have to find 
offense from more unconventional 
places. 
The backcourt duo would go on 
a hot shooting stretch to keep the 
Wolverines in the game. Finishing 
the first half with 14 and eight 
points, respectively, the pair closed 
out the first 20 minutes strong — 
closing out the half with a floater 
from David DeJulius at the buzzer.
In the second half, Michigan got 
in foul trouble. Bad.
The 
Wolverines 
saw 
their 
available personnel dwindle down 
as the Hawkeyes kept receiving foul 
call after foul call — most called on 
defenders bodying up Garza.
Not to be deterred, Michigan 
showed resilience on offense and 
drilled shot after shot to stay in the 
game and even took the lead with 
12 minutes remaining in the second 
half. 
Yet again, when facing the ever-
growing foul deficit, Brooks stepped 

up in the second half, finishing the 
affair with a team-high 25 points 
and a much-needed performance 
following a multi-game shooting 
slump. In short, he was the heart of 
the offense.
“Eli played really well,” senior 
center Austin Davis said. “He did 
a lot of really great things for us 
tonight, and he really gave us a 
boost, and I’m really glad to see that 
from him.” 
This 
time, 
Brooks 
was 
accompanied by freshman forward 
Franz Wagner, who poured in 18 
points of his own and frequently 
acted as the emotional core of the 
team. In the middle of the second 
half, Wagner filled that role with 
pride when he got a lucky bounce on 
a 3-point shot to put the Wolverines 
up by six. The freshman was fiery as 
he shot down the sideline, taunting 
the Iowa faithful.
“I think that’s something that we 
need that we kind of lost during the 
course of the season,” Wagner said. 
“We need to show more emotion 
and within the team show emotion, 
show that we’re motivated … I think 
we did a good job with that, better 
than the last couple games.”
From there, the match was an 
offensive duel. To slow down the 
lights-out Wolverine offense, the 
Hawkeyes needed a few key plays 
of their own. And boy did they get 
them, capped off by a 25-11 Iowa 
run to end the game with Garza 
and guard C.J. Fredrick hitting big 
shots.
The 
Hawkeyes 
got 
the 
big 
plays 
when 
it 
needed 
them. 
Michigan did not. The lead seemed 
insurmountable 
in 
the 
waning 
moments, and Michigan left still 
searching for its first Big Ten road 
win.

Brooks’ 
career-high 
a bright spot 
in loss

IOWA CITY — There weren’t many 
positives for the Michigan men’s 
basketball team following its 90-83 
loss to Iowa. The play of Eli Brooks 
was one of them. 
The junior guard scored a career-
high 25 points on 9-for-16 shooting 
— a noticeable improvement from the 
last three Big Ten games where he 
averaged 5 points and shot 30-percent 
from the field. 
After senior point guard Zavier 
Simpson exited the game with two 
fouls at the 11:10 mark of the first half, 
the Hawkeyes opened up a sizable 
lead. Brooks almost single-handedly 
spearheaded 
the 
Wolverines’ 
resurgence right before halftime. 
With his team teetering on the 
brink of near-disaster, Brooks hit 
consecutive pull-up jumpers to cut 
his team’s deficit back down to single 
digits. 
In 
the 
second 
half, 
Brooks 
continued to shoot the ball well. Off 
feeds from Simpson, Brooks knocked 
down two monumental 3-pointers 
that kept Michigan well within 
striking distance. Both times, in 
typical Eli Brooks fashion, instead 
of fueling the Iowa fans’ fire, Brooks 
simply turned around and jogged 
back on defense expressionless. 
The prowess he showed beyond 
the arc early in the season gave 
opponents 
ample 
reason 
to 
sell 
out defensively and run him off of 
his spots — especially catch-and-
shoot opportunities off Simpson’s 
penetration. 
On Friday, in addition to hitting a 
few open shots, he showed his ability 
to create off the dribble, too. 
“I think just shooting the shots 
in practice,” Brooks said. “Getting 
familiar shooting them at game 
speed. Now that people have scouted 
us, you’re not getting the same open 
shots. You have to shoot in different 
ways and create your shot in different 
ways. So I try to help my shot in 
practice.”

While Brooks’ offensive production 
has dipped recently, his overall play 
has still been solid. Throughout his 
scoring drought, Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard has continued to 
praise his defense and leadership. 
“Usually if you have a guy who 
doesn’t make shots, they forget 
about playing defense on the other 
end because they get so frustrated,” 
Howard said. “He’s shown that he’s 
dependable. So, I’m very happy with 
Eli. He’s one of our leaders and I’m 
proud of his performance.”
Brooks added: “If the offense isn’t 
working, I try to impact the game in 
another way. So I just try to facilitate 
and play defense.”
Brooks’ struggles recently have 
seemingly put a target on his back. 
On top of the pressure he’s already 
placed on himself, the opinions of the 
fans and media have become much 
more vociferous lately — something 
Howard believes is unwarranted. 
“He’s been working extremely hard 
throughout the season,” Howard said. 
“At times, I know he’s been getting 
a lot of media attention and a lot of 
negative 
press. 
Unfortunately, 
at 
times some of it has been disrespectful 
I would say and its been unfair. At the 
end of the day, I have to commend 
him for staying positive, keeping the 
mental toughness and trying to find 
answers.” 
That attention is something Brooks 
tries to avoid when possible. His 
mentality: keep your head down and 
ignore the noise. 
“I try not to have any contact with 
that but obviously you’re going to have 
contact with it,” Brooks said. “I just 
try to follow people that are positive 
and motivators. I think surrounding 
yourself with people like that goes a 
long way. 
“Obviously, you have to realize that 
not everyone on social media knows 
what they’re talking about. I’m here 
for a reason.”
