Daily Sports Writer
After leading the Michigan
men's basketball team to the
national championship game for
the first time since 1993, Michi-
gan Athletic Director Dave Bran-
don announced on Wednesday a
contract extension for coach John
Beilein through the 2018-2019
season.
Beilein led the Wolverines to
31 wins last season, tying the pro-
gram record, and bringing his all-
time winning percentage to .599
(673-403). He also produced two
first-round picks in this year's
NBA draft.
"I am very excited to have this
opportunity to coach at the Uni-
versity of Michigan for at least five
more years," said Beilein. "I am
grateful that President Coleman
and Dave Brandon are pleased
with the direction of our program
and have extended this offer of
agreement. My staff and I will
continue to work every day with

our student-athletes to ensure they
grow from this incredible educa-
tional opportunity.
"At the same time, competing
for Big Ten championship will be
the goal each and every year."
Beilein began in 2007, replac-
ing former coach Tommy Amaker,
after he led West Virginia to the
NIT tournament. The extension
is his second since the 2010-11 sea-
son when the Wolverines made it
to their first NCAA Tournament
since 1998.
Coming off a season that came
within a put-back of consecu-
tive Big Ten regular season titles,
Michigan will return a youth-filled
roster led by sophomore forwards
Glenn Robinson III and Mitch
McGary. With only one senior on
the team in forward Jordan Mor-
gan, it will be a responsibility once
again for Beilein to mold and shape
the young squad.
The Wolverines maintained a
top-10 ranking in the Associated
Press poll for the entire 2012-13
season - highlighted by holding the

ERIN tiRtLANO!
Michigan coach John Beilein will be 66 when his contract expires, after signing an extension through 2018-19 on Wednesday

No. 1 ranking on Jan. 28 - expec-
tations will be high for Michigan
next season and going forward.
"John is a tremendous ambas-
sador of the University of Michi-
gan and one of the most highly
respected coaches in the country,"

said Brandon. "He recruits out-
standing young men to represent
the men's basketball program and
develops them as players, students
and future leaders. John has built
a program that will compete for
Big Ten championships on a regu-

lar basis and make exciting NCAA
Tournament runs."
"We look forward to John,
Kathleen and the entire Beilein
family representing the University
of Michigan for the foreseeable
future."

Wards
vied for
in Dem.
primary
Grand, Eaton look
to unseat City
Council incumbents
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily News Editor
In a 90 percent Democratic
Ann Arbor City Council, two of
the five represented wards will
be contested in the August 6th
primary.
Julie Grand, who currently
serves as the chair of the city's
Parks Advisory Commission,
is challenging incumbent Ste-
phen Kunselman (D-Ward 3).
Jack Eaton, a longtime neigh-
hvorhood activist and laboir
attorney, is seeking to unseat
Marcia Higgins (D-Ward 4).
While Grand said she has
been focusing her efforts on
personally connecting with
voters by knocking on doors,
Kunselman said he is relying
on the strength of his record
on City Council to carry him
through the primary.
Kunselman was first elected
to the council in 2006 and has
held his seat since, apart from
one year in 2008. He said his
defeat resulted from distancing
himself from Mayor John
Hieftje and his supporters.
"(Wanting to be a better com-
municator is) how I distinguish
myself from my opponent,"
Grand said. "I know that my
opponent hasn't made really
thoughtful decisions on council
- he's just been very divisive ...
If you're really listening to your
constituents then you have a bet-
ter idea of what the real issues are
in the ward."

Undocumented
students could have
access to in-state rate
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
ManagingNews Editor
Eight students were arrested
in front of the Michigan Union
this past April for blocking traffic.
Fifty crowded the April meeting of
the University's Board of Regents
wearing bright maize shirts.
These students - organized by
the Coalition for Tuition Equality
- gathered time and again to
advocate for in-state tuition for
undocumented students.
After almost a year of activity,
and the convening of a joint
task force of administrators and
students, University President
Mary Sue Coleman's promise of
a "positive recommendation" for

tuition equality will be presented
before the Regents at their
meeting Thursday.
University Provost Martha
Pollack, in communication
with the regents, has proposed
simplified residency guidelines
that will specify three pathways
for attaining in-state residency
status: being a Michigan resident,
service in the U.S. military or
attending Michigan middle or
high schools.
"Students who are not legal
residents of the state of Michigan
or of the United States may
qualify for in-state tuition under
this school-attendance-based
approach," Pollack said.
Students who qualify for the
attendance-based approach
would be those who attended
Michigan middle school for two
years followed by three years of
attendance at and graduation
from a Michigan high school.

These students would also need
to start their University education
within 28 months of graduation
from high school.
These changes to determining
residency, the first review of this
policy since 2005, will be imple-
mented by January 2014. How-
ever, this will still not change the
ability for undocumented students
to receive federal financial aid.
University spokesperson Rick
Fitzgerald said the University
decided to implement the
policy in January, rather than
in September for fall semester,
because it gives University staff
enough time to make sure "all of
the details have been adequately
worked through."
Pollack said in a University
press release that the changes
provided a simpler path for those
seeking to qualify for in-state
tuition.

Recruiting, Europe trip highlight summer work

Scientific images
reworked as artistic
pieces up for sale
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
A crowd descended upon Ann
Arbor on a sizzling Wednesday
afternoon for the first day of
the city's 54th annual Art Fair,
which features hundreds of
booths exhibiting art, selling
food and hawking products
and promotions, as well as
displaying work from University
researchers.
The fair itself is a combination
of four separate fairs: the Ann
Arbor Art Fair, Ann Arbor's
South University Art Fair, the
State Street Area Art Fair and
the Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair.
The fair runs until Saturday.
In total, it covers over 30 city
blocks with lltt artists and an
estimated half million people in
attendance. The artists hail from
all over, coming from 38 different
states and four countries along
with local Ann Arbor artists.
Art Fair spokesperson Daniel
Cherrin said the event is a kind
of two-way street: Ann Arbor
hosts the artists so they can be
included in one of the nation's
largest art fairs, while in return
the event brings business to the
city.
"The city itself is raw, the Art
Fair itself is another way to bring
people into the city and to enjoy
what it has to offer," he said. "It's
a Michigan tradition."
Cherrin said this year the fair
has expanded walking space to
better accommodate foot traffic,
added shuttle services and
increased parking options.
To address the projected
90-degree weather, Cherrin said
there will be misting stations
along South University Avenue
and State Street as well as an air-
conditioned trolley which will
tour the fair. Cherrin said staff
will remind attendees to stay
hydrated and; safe but he doesn't

Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico does a lot of traveling by
plane these days.
For starters, there's the never-
ending cycle of recruiting visits all
over the country, followed by the
visits back home to Ann Arbor to
preside over her players and check
in on practices. Then there's the
upcoming trip to Europe with the
Michiganwomen'sbasketball team.
And in between all of it, is a vaca-
tion - a trip to Walt Disney World
in Orlando, Fla. with her family.
"I got an opportunity to take
my girls to Disney World," Barnes
Arico said. "I've been trying to do it
for years and last year getting hired
in the springI didn'treally have the
opportunity, so I had a chance to do
that and (also) to visit with my fam-
ily in the offseason."
But after the success of last sea-
son, in which the Wolverines fin-
ished 22-11 and advanced to the
se'ond round of \Ithe NCAA Tou.-

work out on their own with our
strength coach doing some lifting
and conditioning."
And for all the successes last
season, Barnes Arico and Michigan
will have have a lot of holes to fill
this season. The Wolverines lose
five seniors to graduation, all of
whom were an integral part of the
team, as they accounted for over 80
percent of the offense. Their grad-
uation turned the Wolverines into
an inexperienced squad overnight.
Highlighting the inexperience
are Michigan's three freshmen as
well as the addition of junior trans-
fer guard Shannon Smith from
North Carolina. In addition, four
players who tore their ACL last
summer are back with the team
after not playing all of last season.
"Obviously we have four new
kids and four returners coming
off of ACL surgery, so really that's
eight kids that haven't played last
year and a total of 11 on our roster,"
Barnes Arico said. "So, we're going
to be very inexperienced and very
vungn."

While the freshmen new faces
arrived to campus during the last
week of June, Smith has been in
Ann Arbor since the spring semes-
ter. During her freshmen season
in 2010-2011 at UNC, Smith was a
dynamic scorer but only played in
eight games before takinga medical
redshirt due to a lingering illness.
In Smith's sophomore cam-
paign, she played in 25 games and
averaged 3 points per game and 13
minutes per game. Smith, who still
has two more years of eligibility,
sat out the 2012-2013 season before
transferring to Michigan
"We're fortunate Shannon has
been here for both (the) spring ses-
sion and summer session and she's
just been an absolute pleasure to
have around," Barnes Arico said.
"She really made a commitment to
doing well in the classroom in her
first semester here and did a great
job. She's just such a competitive
kid and really truly loves the game
of basketball and has been a winner
every place that she's been.
"She is in the gym nonstop when
she's not in study hall or in class.
She spends her free time in the
gym really working on her game,
and I'm excited to have her because
she really wants to win. She's very
competitive and she wants to bring
her winning spirit to our program."
The rest of the new faces -
freshmen guards Siera Thompson,
Paige Rakers and Danielle Wil-
liams - have been on campus for
a couple of weeks and have been
hard at work both on and off the
court.
"They've had a wonderful tran-
sition," Barnes Arico said. "The
three of them are outstanding
young ladies from great fami-
lies and they're doing really well.
Academically, they've all gotten
off to a really great start (and)
socially, they're adjusting to life
in Michigan, life as a college stu-
dent. They're great kids and we're
expecting big things from them."
The Wolverines are taking a for-
eign trip to France and Spain to play
three games. The trip will allow
Michigan to have ten practices in
the summer and begin full practice
before many other teams. It won't
just be all fun, though, as the Wol-
verines are expected to make stops
to Lake Como, the Pantheon, Col-
osseum and Eiffel Tower.
"We're excited about (the
opportunity) to get a jump start on
things," Barnes Arico sail "We'
really fortunate to have thie tinme in

the summer to get some workouts
under our belt."
Amid the transitioning players
and continuous workouts, Barnes
Arico has also been in and out of
Ann Arbor traveling to recruit
players. Soon, formal practices
will be back in session and will be
added to the running list on Barnes
Arico's plate.
If the plane rides are what it
takes to get ahead of the game and
continue winning, then Barnes
Arico wouldn't have it any other
way.
Trip Details
After announcing its plans ear-
lier to take a trip to France and
Italy from August 19-29, the Michi-
gan women's basketball team has
released further details of the trip.
The 10-day long trip will begin

on the 19th when the Wolver- 40
ines depart Ann Arbor, heading
through the night to Paris - the
location of their first game, which
will take place on Aug. 23. Two
more games in Europe will follow
for Michigan, as it stops in Lake a
Como on the 24th and Rome on the
27th to complete its menage a trois.
In between the three games,
the Wolverines will makes stops in
the south of France and Florence
before heading back to Ann Arbor
on the 29th.
Of course, Michigan wouldn't be
ready for its series of games if not
for practice. The Wolverines will
commence their preparation on
Thursday, July 18th for four days
before completing the rest of their,
ten allowed summer practices in
August.

'M'RL'NE LACASSE/Uaiy
University researcher Jennifer Freeman describes a photograph to visitors at a booth of bio-artography, microscopic images
originally captured during scientific research.

people know that the Art Fair
is coming up and it's something
that we all plan for," he said.
Though the fair does not
include work from the School of
Art and Design, it does feature
some pieces from University
faculty. Among these includes
"bio-artography", a science-
meets-art creation by University
researchers.
Bio-artography is composed
of pictures taken during lab
work through microscopes and
features the naturally occurring
art within living cells.
Deborah Gumucio, professor
of cell and developmental biology
and head of the bio-artography
project, said she and her
colleagues started selling these
pictures at the Art Fair in 2005
as a way to raise money for young
student-scientists to attend
meetings across the country.
Gumucio said the process
involves faculty from five
University schools and 27
different departments with

researchers submitting images
they have taken during the
course of their work. Light and
color is then added in to the
received pictures. Gumucio
and five faculty members in
the School of Art and Design
then vote the pieces that will be
displayed.
The images portray anything
from cancer to stem cells,
Gumucio said. She added that on
top of being visually pleasing, the
pictures have the appeal of being
from actual work done at the
University.
Because of this, Gumucio said
the pictures both raise money
and help to educate and engage
the public on science. Through
her work, she has spoken at high
schools, forums and meetings to
discuss the way that science and
art can be used to promote each
other.
"We'll start talking about
something - let's say the induced
'iuripotenit sten cells," Gumucio
said. "And now you have an

opportunity to tell them what
the differences are between
whole-organ stem cells in an
adult versus pluripotent stem
cells that you make from an adult
versus embryonic stem cells."
Gumucio said the project
typically puts forth about 100
pictures, which usually generate
about $9,000 to $10,000 - half
of which goes to preparing the
images and the other half to the
students. Gumucio said since
2005, the project has sent over 60
students to meetings nationwide.
Theresa Reid, executive
director of Arts Engine and one
of the five artists that vote on the
images used in the project, said
the images are "fantastic" and
that she really supports the bio-
artography project.
"(Gumucio and her colleagues
have) been encouraged to see the
beauty of their scientific work
in ways that I don't think they
otherwise would have," Reid
said.

'U' researchers see fall in
depression among elderly

'U' startup
investments to

Website to receive
design upgrades

Ten-year study
shows improvement,
despite need for
further observation
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily Staff Reporter
New research from the
University indicates that old-
age may not be as depressing as
demonstrated in the past.
Kara Zivin, assistant professor
of psychiatry, and her team used
a Health and Retirement Survey
of subjects age 55 and older and
found depressive symptoms to be
in a general decline.
Results, which were collected
over a 10-year period between
1998 and 2008 with 16,184 sub-
jects, were determined using the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale, which includes
eight symptoms of depression.
Subjects answered the survey

based on the number of symp-
toms they experienced in the
week before taking the survey.
Zivin said the number of
subjects with four or more
symptoms, the minimum number
to indicate significant depression,
decreased over the course of the
study. The results also indicated
that the number of people with
zero symptoms increased from
40.9 percent to 47.4 percent and
there were no significant changes
in severe symptoms for those 60
or older.
However, within the 55- to
59-year-old age group, the number
showing severe symptoms - six
or more - increased from 5.8
percent to 6.8 percent. Zivin
said while not enough research
has been done to explain the
variances between age groups, it
is important to understand that
not all older adults are treated the
same way.
"Things that may be affect-
ing mental health in a 50-year-old
may be very different than mental

health in an 80- year-old," she said.
The study came in the context
of a larger "program project
grant" that primarily included
faculty from the University and
Harvard University. Within the
project are five studies in various
areas of the healthcare field with
the overall goal of assessing the
cost and quality of health care
treatment in the U.S.
Sandeep Vijan, associate
professor of internal medicine and
a co-author of the study, said while
it's too early to give any definitive
statements the results' impact on
mental health care, there are signs
that care could be improving.
"The fact that these changes
hold up in the face of all those
other things at least suggest that
it could be due to better diagnosis
and treatment," Vijan said.
While the researchers consid-
ered factors such as race, gender
and net worth, Vijan said there are
many external factors that were
not included in the study, such as
the Great Recession, that will need

mmoomm.

to be assessed in future studies.
Zivin said she plans to use
Medicare data for the next study
so depression symptom analysis
can be compared with standard
treatment and hopes to further
analyze why some subjects
remain depressed while some
improve with time.
"The analysis that we did was
just looking at basic population
prevalence, what proportion of
people have depression," Zivin
said. "Which is a different question
than, 'Does an individual person
stay depressed for a long period of
time or do they get better?"'
Vijan said the full process of
locating specific benefits and
weaknesses of mental health care
in America will take a while and
called it an "interim process."
"We should still try to make
sure those people are getting
what they need in terms of treat-
ment or in terms of other sup-
port," Zivin said. "So, there's
good news but we can't just say,
'Okay, everything is fine.' "

Program has given
up to $500,000 to
seven medical and
science companies
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
Innovative faculty are not the
only ones who stand to benefit
from Michigan Investment
in New Technology Startups,
a University program which
invests in faculty startups. By
investing in these companies,
MINTs could bolster the
University's endowment.
Seven faculty startups that
have met the requirements
already received funds, of up to
$500,000, from the 18-month-
old MINTS program. Five of
these are in the healthcare
sector and the others are related
to development in the field of
physical sciences.
The University will also invest
$1 million of endowment funds
in. an individual startup over a
10-year span.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman, when announcing
the program nearly two years
ago, said past faculty startups
have returned impressive profits.
The Michigan Daily previously
reported that if the University
invested funds in future startups,
it could strengthen University
coffers as well as the state's
economy.
Rafael Castilla,theUniversity's
investment risk management
director, said one startup could
be sold within the next two
years, but it's more likely that the
University will have to hold on to
the investments for a decade or
more.
"We have generally a very
long-term horizon," he said. "We
hope there's going to be a return,
but we're in no rush to sell as
soon as possible."
Associate Engineering Prof.

Wei Lu, co-founder of the
computer hardware startup
Crossbar Inc., said hardware
industry generally had returns
in the long term. Crossbar's
products, which consist of
new architecture for computer
memory, will not reach the
market for years and the profit
margin for these types of
products are typically slimmer
than software and social media
startups. Funding such startups
prove more difficult.
Thoughrisky,Lusaidhardware
innovation revolutionizes
computer technology, and
'Crossbar's breed of memristor
chips could do just that.
. "It can be potentially very
important and change the
semiconductor landscape, but it
has not been fully proven yet," Lu
said.
While faculty startup
investment programs are
uncommon, they are gaining
interest. Investments Manager
Felicia David-Visser said she's

works to create
ihone adjustments

The University's website,
which has over half a million
visitors a year, is getting a
facelift.
After over two years of
research toward the redesign,
a team at Michigan Creative, a
division of the Communications
department, has developed a
"responsive" system that easily

adjusts the website to any device.
"If you're accessing from a
desktop or an iPhone, it will
recognize the device and
rescale accordingly," University
spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald
said. "There's no longer a need
for a separate iPhone app or
different interface. The website
simply recalibrates so it fits on
your cell phone."
Fitzgerald said the goal of the
redesign is to make the website
as clear and accessible as possible
in all formats. With the gradual
change in technology over time,
the Michigan Creative team
developed this platform in order
to keep pace with how customers

access the information.
"The website is the front door
of the University of Michigan on
the Internet," Fitzgerald said. "We
refer to it as the gateway because
it's how we envision it: the gateway
to learning about the University of
Michigan on the web. It's through
that website that you can unlock
the door to a world of knowledge
about the University of Michigan."
To improve website functioning,
primary research began in
2011 when the University
teamed up with marketing and
communications firm Lipman
Hearne in order to analyze how
people were navigating the website.

A call for tuitionequality
Regents should approve revisions amid Congress's inaction
At their meeting Thursday, the University's Board of Regents will
consider proposed revisions to the University's in-state tuition
guidelines that would make it possible for undocumented
students from Michigan - who currently pay out-of-state tuition rates
- to qualify for in-state tuition. If approved, these revisions would be
a major victory for the student-led Coalition for Tuition Equality and
affiliated student organizations, as they have sought an opportunity for
undocumented students to qualify for in-state tuition since October2011.
By approving these revisions, the regents can greatly aid undocumented
students in the state and do their part in what has become a nationwide
movement towards revamping immigration policy.

his Friday, the first session
- of the camp I'm working at
this summer will come to
a close. Nearly 600 campers will
be leaving the
woods and the
new friends they
have made and
return home.
At the end
of many school 1
years, it's easy to
question wheth- DEREK
er or not I've WOLFE
actually learned
anything. I know
I've spent countless hours studying
and working on class assignments,
but it's not unreasonable to wonder
if I've truly advanced academically.
The same question can be asked
for camp, just in a very different
context - have I grown as a person?
The week before camp - known as
"precamp" - the staff is essentially
preached two core values: keep
the kids safe and let them have the
summer of their lives.
But I think there's a third
unwritten value that is perhaps
more important than having fun -
find a way to get kids to break out of
their comfort zones.
The comfort zone is defined as
a state of mind in which anxiety and
the feeling of risk are minimized.
Mental boundaries are set and
it takes immense courage for
anyone to step outside of the "zone,"
myself included.
But I recognize there are many
reasons why it's important to break
out of the comfort zone. To name
a few, it maintains a sense of drive
and ambition. If we're too unwill-
ing to leave the comfort zone, then
it's likely we'll never get around to
accomplishing the things that could
lead to a meaningful life. From per-
sonal experience, each and every
time I've stepped outside my com-
fort zone - and that can be as sim-
ple as making a phone call to a total
stranger - the added experience
makes the next challenge easier to
deal with. And lastly, it can help us
live with a more open mind. Any
idea I've pursued that at first seemed
risky or scary but ended up work-
ing out provides confidence that a
similar idea could result similarly.
Essentially, there should be no fear
of being bold. We're at our best at a
level called "optimal anxiety" and in
order to reach it, risk-taking must be
a part of our daily agenda.
As a counselor, the campers I've
watched overall have a different
willingness to step outside the

comfort zone. Some will attempt a
Recreation, Observation, Problem
Solving, Experiential Education and
Self-Esteem course head-on with
no thought whatsoever and others
will overthink an activity to the
point of mental paralysis. There's
absolutely nothing that can be said
to make these campers participate in
activities they're afraid of.
Dealing with this range of emo-
tions is challenging. Trying too hard
and ultimately forcing the camper
to do something they fear could be
traumatizing and diminish the con-
fidence they have. But if we - the
counselors - don't try hard enough,
then these campers will remain
within the comfort zone and will
never know what they're missing if
they don't expand their horizons.
We want to make
them better
people.
After spending nearly every
moment with these campers for
three weeks, the camper-counselor
relationship becomes very close,
almost parent-like. We want -
more than anything - to see these
teenagers reach their potential,
whatever that may be. Like I said in
my last column, there is no great-
er feeling than watching a child
accomplish something for the first
time. And there's also no greater
frustration than watching a child
not accomplish something they are
capable of doing.
Last year, my friend joked that
instead of writing camp counselor
on his resume, he would write that
he was a "child development special-
ist." And that's a quite accurate job
description. Each session, the goal is
to leave each camper with a greater
sense of self-worth and confidence.
Ultimately, we want to make them
better people.
Stepping-out of the comfort zone
- no matter how small the step - is
where that change begins. There's
no debate-about whether its easy to
do that or not because it's hard, no
doubt. But being able to dig deep for
a split second and find the courage
to do something out of the ordinary
routine has long-lasting positive
effects down the road. '

Netflix's lastest
series challenges
industry standards
By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
ManagingArts Editor
I had a few concerns about Netf-
lix's latest original series, "Orange
is the New Black." I worried it
would expect us
to sympathize "
exclusively with
its main char- Orange iS
acter '-the very the New
white and very B
privileged Piper Bck
Chapman - as Season 1
she navigates the
Litchfield wom- Netfxli
en's federal pris-
on. I worried it would succumb to
white saviorism, presenting Piper
as the prison angel among a cast
of anonymous criminals. I wor-
ried it would romanticize prison
life in the same way creator Jenji
Kohan's previous work "Weeds"
romanticized the drug trade.
"Orange" does none of these
things.
Piper Chapman (Taylor Schil-
ling, "The Lucky One"), with her
attractive fiance Larry (Jason
Biggs, "American Pie") and suc-
cessful artisanal soap company,
basically lives one of those posh
New York lifestyles that only
seems to exist in Nora Ephron
movies and the New York Times
style section. But none of that mat-
ters anymore as she finds herself

facing a 15-month stint in federal
prison for a crime she committed
10 years prior with her then-girl-
friend Alex (Laura Prepon, "That
70s Show"), a cool, sexy inter-
national drug trafficker (pro tip:
don't fall for cool,' sexy interna-
tional drug traffickers, no matter
how cool and sexy they are).
Piper arrives at Litchfield,
determined to make her time in
prison count, maybe learn a craft
or two, and then return to her
fianc6 Larry as a new, enlightened
woman. She's met quickly with
the harsh, metallic clamor of pris-
on reality. It's a place where say-
ing the wrong thing at the wrong
time can leave you without food
for days, a place where money is
replaced with a barter system that
includes everything from cans of
Pepsi to duct tape to sex. The only
new crafts she learns are how to
fix broken lamps, how to fashion
shower slippers out of Maxi pads
and how to live locked up with the
ex-girlfriend who landed her in
this shit hole in the first place.
"This isn't 'Oz,' " a correctional
officer remarks during Piper's
Litchfield check-in. With its sharp
humor and female-centric sto-
rytelling, the series isn't exactly
of the same brand as "Oz," but
to call it too watered down to
be compared to the harrowing
HBO series - or worse, "Oz" for
women - is insulting and untrue.
"Orange" uses graphic violence
sparingly, but when it does, it's
powerful. There's darkness with-
in the walls of Litchfield. The tone
weaves expertly between sweet

and poisonous. A jubilant celebra-
tion - set to Kelis's "Milkshake,"
obviously - for an inmate who's
finally getting out takes a nasty
turn that lands Piper in solitary
for an isolating Thanksgiving
marked by nonsensical echoes
and moldy bologna.
In Piper's first few weeks
behind bars, "Orange" starts to
unfurl a series of wonderful sur-
prises. Though we stay close to
Piper throughout the 13-episode
first season, the story isn't just
hers. She shares it with a whole
crew of intricate characters who
are far from anonymous. There's
Morello (Yael Stone, "Spirited"),
who spends her days planning
her wedding with a boyfriend
who never visits and screwing the
lesbian ex-heroin-junkie Nich-
ols (Natasha Lyonne, "Weeds").
There's Daya (newcomer Dascha
Polanco), who tries so desperate-
ly to not end up like her mother
(Elizabeth Rodriguez, "Prime
Suspect"), a fellow inmate who
welcomes her to Litchfield with
a motherly slap across the face.
The Russian head chef with a
bad temper, Red (Kate Mulgrew,
"Warehouse 13"), acts as a moth-
er figure to many of the girls,
including Tricia (newcomer Mad-
eline Brewer), a lovesick junkie
who keeps a handwritten ledger
of everything she's ever stolen
so she can one day pay her debts.
Piper's roommate Miss Claudette
(Michelle Hurst, "Blue Bloods")
is fiercely tidy, and whispered
rumors that she killed a man fol-
low her everywhere. When it's

time for a new 'do, the girls know
to go to resident stylist Sophia
(Laverne Cox, "Transform Me"),
a trans woman who befriends
a hilariously liberal nun (Beth
Fowler, "Gossip Girl").
Well-placed flashbacks reveal
how some of these characters
ended up in Litchfield, and it
quickly becomes clear that no
one woman belongs here more
than any other. They're full of
flaws and unconventional talents.
They're vastly distinct from one
another, yet their stories overlap
in compelling ways, as relation-
ships - maternal, sexual, amia-
ble, hostile - form and transform
from episode to episode.
The characters -are backed by
a superb cast. Schilling gives a
career-making performance, and
Prepon similarly delivers at an
emotional level we haven't gotten
from her in past work. This cast -
which bursts with talented new-
comers - also strikingly looks
like no other ensemble you'll see
on television, starring women of
varying ages, sizes, races and sex-
ual orientations. With its diverse
representation of women, race
and sexuality play huge roles in
the show's narratives. It explores
trans issues with a candor rarely
found on television and delves
into lesbian love as complexly as
"The L Word" once did (though
it's worth noting that "Orange"
manages, so far, to be more coher-
ent and substantive than "The L
Word" ever was).
When Larry becomes con-
cerned that Piper is getting

too swept up in prison life (her
world suddenly revolves around
the sighting of a fabled chicken,
because fowl folklore is appar-
ently quite powerful in prison),'
he points out it's like living in a
fishbowl. As I barreled through
the first season of "Orange"
(thanks to the release-it-all-at-
once delivery method of Netflix
original programming), I found
myself completely swept up in the
super-detailed world Kohan has
created. With its specificity and
colorful characters, "Orange" is
like a fishbowl you can't help but
love being thrown into.

Under the revised policy,
undocumented students would
be eligible for in-state tuition if
they attended at least two years
of middle school and three years
of high school in the state, gradu-
ated from a Michigan high school
or earned a Michigan high school
equivalency certificate and start
classes at the University within 28
months of graduation. This would
be one of three ways students
could claim eligibility for in-state
tuition - the other two are Michi-
gan residency and being either a
member of the military or having
a family member in the military.
Many undocumented students'
status as non-residents is a result
of their parents bringing them to
Michigan and the U.S. at a young
age - a condition outside of their
control. For the 29,000 undocu-
mented students currently living
in Michigan, a college education,
let alone a University education
- charging out-of-state tuition

- on the average undocumented
household's income of $36,000
per year is virtually impossible
to afford. However, being able to
claim in-state residency and the
corresponding in-state tuition
rate would make attending the
University far more feasible.
But even if the regents approve
these revisions - and they should
- the fundamental issues of an
antiquated federal immigration
policy behind many of the prob-
lems undocumented students face
will remain in place. Currently,
undocumented students can't
apply for federal financial aid.
This is largely because they don't
meet the requirements for acquir-
ing permanent residence visas or
"green cards". Moreover, under
current law there is a backlog of
over four million applications for
these visas. A Senate immigra-
tion reform bill passed in late
June goes a long way towards fix-
ing this problem by providing an

alternative pathway to citizenship
for undocumented immigrants.
But the bill wouldn't permit stu-
dents who have set out on this
path to apply for financial aid, and
House Republicans have stated
they don't intend to introduce a
similarly sweeping package any-
time soon.
With widespread support for
tuition equality evidenced by
CTE's nearly two-year campaign
as well as a Congress that has
proven its capacity for inaction on
important issues such as immi-
gration reform time and time
again, the regents should approve
the proposed in-state tuition
guidelines. Doing so would both
reaffirm the University's commit-
ment to Michigan's residents and
serve as an important gesture of
solidarity to undocumented peo-
ple who - though not American
citizens - desire a world-class
education and a chance to make
their mark in the U.S.

By JOHN LYNCH

At 4:30 p.m. on the day of the
show, I printed out the tickets for my
-first Bob Dylan concert and lament-
ed that I was seeing him at a ooint in

time when tickets could be printed
at home. Though modern science
had miraculously allowed me to
purchase the tickets five minutes
earlier on a whim, I decided that I
could not be satisfied with technol-
ogy until the day that some machine

could transport me through space
and time and spit me out in the late
'60s, landing cleanly on my feet like a
gymnast in the front row of a Blonde
on Blonde-era show.
Having no such device, I'd decid-
ed to "settle" for seeing My Morn-

ing Jacket and Wilco - two of my
favorite bands - open for Dylan
on this summer's AmericanaramA
tour. And then, with our printed-out
tickets, my sister and my friends and
I made the the trek out to DTE and
found ourselves in a crowd of baby

boomers, many of whom had seen
Bob in the days before Ticketmaster.
"He'll usually play a couple of
hours worth with a few hits thrown
in here and there," said the beard-
ed man behind me in the line for
T-shirts. "His voice is worse than
you'd imagine."
My Morning Jacket and its lead
singer Jim James - shaped like an
enigma with a striped native blan-
ket wrapped around his shoulders
- played a set that ran through the
band's variety of styles and remind-
ed me of their haphazard greatness.
The folky "Golden" felt as fresh as
the obtuse power of "Holdin' On To
Black Metal," and memories were
certainly made when one old shirt-
less man stood before the sea of
blankets on the lawn and belted out
every "aahhhh ahhhhh" of "Word-
less Chorus."
Wilco played Yankee Hotel Fox-
trot favorites and more obscure
material, and everything was right
on point. "I Am Trying To Break
Your Heart" made mine palpitate
and the odd beauty of "Impossible
Germany" translated perfectly to
the live setting.
Each opening act then joined
each other for a cover of The Bea-
tles' "Tomorrow Never Knows,"
and after a short break, Bob Dylan
appeared looking like the skeletal
embodiment of former greatness.
Dylan, his never-great voice now
reduced to heavy and largely inco-
herent grumblings, didn't move an
inch on stage as he and his band ran
through a perplexing setlist. Clas-
sics such as "Tangled Up In Blue,"
"Simple Twist of Fate" and "All
Along the Watchtower" stuck out
even if their lyrics were barely rec-
ognizable in Dylan's 2013 voice, and
the only true reminder of his heyday
was the harmonica solos, which still
pierced through the instrumenta-
tion and the night sky with vigor.
Laying down on the lawn and
staring up at the expansive sky, I
honestly felt a galaxy away from
the stage. Perfection is sitting under
the stars and listening to Bob Dylan,
I convinced myself and ignored his
imperfections. And when my writer
friend turned and showed me a pic-
ture of a young Dylan with Allen
Ginsberg at Jack Kerouac's grave, I
remembered the power of Dylan's
poetic works and was completely
satisfied with everything about that
night - even if I couldn't recognize
that he closed with "Blowin' In The
Wind."

The University has a long and proud
history of promoting social justice.
Thursday, the University's Board of
Regents can pen the next chapter
in this storied history by passing
tuition equality.
Moreover, the University has a
compelling opportunity to establish
a policy that will benefit the lives of
undocumented youth. Access to in-state
tuition for undocumented students is
more than sensible education policy -
it's a good first step toward fulfilling
one of the most pressing needs of today:
equitable access to higher education.
We commend the University for
considering a new residency policy that
wouldbroadenaccesstohighereducation
forundocumentedstudents-however,to
ensure an equitable experience for these
students, the University must commit
itself to advancing a comprehensive
approach to meeting the needs of this
population.
Our work at the National Forum on
Higher Education for the Public Good
- a policy and research institute based
in the University's School of Education
- has demonstrated that increasing
opportunities to higher education for
all capable students fosters greater civic
engagement and more diverse demo-
cratic participation. Of the estimated
two million undocumented youth in the
country, 29,000 reside in Michigan. An
estimated five to ten percent of them
pursue higher education. To address
the persistent college enrollment gap
between documented and undocument-
ed students, nearly 20 states have enact-
ed inclusive in-state tuition and financial
aid policies. However, research indicates
that undocumented students continue
to face additional barriers to completing
college because they lack access to aca-
demic and support services and struggle
to cover the cost of attendance.
In short, the University must com-
mit itself to supporting undocumented
students for the long haul. This commit-
ment will require the University to take
three more important steps - provide
further support to undocumented stu-
dents that ensures their successful com-
pletion of a college degree, encourage
other institutions of higher education
to follow the University's lead and reach
out to communities that are most affect-
ed by undocumented student issues.
First, the University must create an
equitable college experience for undoc-
umented students, which will require
much greater support than it currently
provides. In terms of financial access,
the University can complement the
strides made by tuition equality with
institutional aid. In its upcoming capi-

tal campaign, the University intends
to raise billions of dollars, with a focus
on financial aid. This provides a timely
opportunity to establish an undocu-
mented student-specific scholarship
fund through the campaign. In the
absence of federal financial aid, institu-
tional aid will likely make the difference
in the ability of many undocumented
students to afford a University educa-
tion. The University must also provide
holistic academic support services for
undocumented students. The University
of California-Berkeley's Undocumented
Student Program provides a promising
example for our University to emulate.
Second, the University must
recognize the rights of residency for
undocumented students from this state
and thereby set a standard for its peer
institutions. In doing so, the University
may encourage institutions nationally
to align their own policies and practices
more closely with the values of inclusion
and educational opportunity that are
essential in promoting the broader
values of a democratic society.
Third, the University must sustain a
public commitment to access for undoc-
umented students. This commitment
will further encourage Michigan's top
students to attend the University. In
Michigan communities - particularly
ones with substantial undocumented
populations - the University stands to
tap into potential that would otherwise
go to waste. Too often, undocumented
students realize their status and decide
against pursuing a University education
because of the steep cost of attendance.
Inclusive policies would give hope to stu-
dents who would otherwise give up on
pursuing a higher education - let alone
a University degree - during or before
high school. If the University wants
to admit increasingly larger cohorts
of undocumented students, it needs to
ensure these students - who would oth-
erwise excel at the University if prepared
- know that the University is a realistic
option earlier in their K-12 schooling.
We encourage the University's Board
of Regents to uphold equal opportunity
for all students from Michigan by
passing tuition equality. We call on
those who share our view to express
their support for tuition equality and
other inclusive policies to the University
administration and Board of Regents.
Thursday's vote represents a historic
opportunity to affirm this University's
commitment to access and inclusion
for the residents of this state. It is also
simply the right thing to do.

a party with a certain kind of
anxiety that comes along with
knowing everyone around you
is on another planet. You brace
yourself for the slow burn as
you lift the bottle to your lips
and drink until you cough,
eyes watering.
Fast forward. Your coat
has been tossed in a corner -
remind yourself not to forget
it, you always forget it - and
you are jumping up and down,
swinging limbs manically in
a crowd full of people. Your
friends have mysteriously
disappeared, but that doesn't
matter because a cute boy has
decided to be your dance part-

nor does he know yours. You
dance in a way you know
you'll cringe at when you look

When did a night full of
dubstep, sweaty frat bros and
seizure-inducing lights become
the normative standard of a
"fun night out"? Why is it that
you need to be drunk in order
to let loose and enjoy yourself?
There is an entire world out

seeking out avoidance at the
bottom of a bottle.

PRIMARY
From Page 1
Grand said her focus on
availability to constituents - she
plans to hold weekly office hours
if elected - stems from the fact
that she said it's hard to predict
the exact issues that will come up
within the next two years.
Grand said she has been able
to gain support from numerous
Republican residents who agree
with her local policy stances
regardless of her personal opinions
of national-level politics.
"I feel there are very
fundamental differences between
the two of us (Kunselman and
myself)," Grand said. "You don't
pick on an incumbent unless you
think you're presenting a very
different approach and vision
for the city ... he flat-out just said
he doesn't think it's his job to
proactively communicate with his
constituents."
Throughout the race,
Kunselman has said Grand's focus
on communication is a sign that
she is weaker on the issues.
"I run on issues - I'm a very
strong candidate when it comes to
a record because I have a record
of achievement on City Council,"
Kunselman said.
Kunselman said criticisms
illustrating him as divisive are
counterproductive and unfounded,
citing his strong base of supporters
who have consistently re-elected
him.
In addition, he said Grand's
decision to run was based more
on requital than a commitment to
the issues, given that her husband
has previously worked with
Leigh Greden, whom Kunselman
unseated in 2009.
"She was basically recruited by
them," Kunselman said. "It's not
about running on issues, it's about
running revenge."
In addition to "running on
issues," which he says has been
central to both his races and
service on the council, Kunselman
said he wants city government to
be more transparent to instill trust
in his constituents.
One issue over which Grand
and Kunselman appear to see
more eye-to-eye on is in their
hesitation in encouraging
University student candidates to
run for City Council.
"(Students are) a vital part of
the community but at the same
time ... are here for the short term
and much of what the council

does in terms of decisions doesn't "The problem with that whole who are challenging incumbents. direction that our city council is Police Department to return to broader pool of constituents. for a very loni

STARTUP
From Page 3

"We felt we had a compelling
story pursuing a rare cancer for
which there are very limited
treatment options," Owens said.
She said venture capital
firms typically profit from
biotech startups like Atterocor
when they're acquired by large

pharmaceuticalcompanies,though
Atterocor's drug may not reach the
market until 2023.
Castilla said University
investment in its faculty's startups
is not new. But prior to MINTS,
the University provided venture
capitalists with money and those
venture capital firms would invest
the funds as they wished.
That said, current investment
through MINTS isstill linked with
venture capital firms. Castilla said
when startups seek funding from
multiple investors at once, a firm
leads the round, deciding how
much each investor will give to
fund the startup.
But MINTS allows the
University to choose which
startups to invest in.
"We are able to learn about at
least certain innovations at the-"".
University in greater depth and
detail than we would without
MINTS," Castilla said. "Of course,
the University is large and even
what we learn represents only a
small fraction of the research and
innovation happening."
TUITION
From Page 1
"We believe these changes
create a clearer path to
in-state tuition for several
groups of future students,
including military veterans
and undocumented students
who have made Michigan their
home," she said.
But with the passage of
these changes, despite the
constitutional autonomy of
the University and the ability
of the Regents to set tuition
independent of the state, the
University could face injunctive
lawsuits to reverse the policy.
University administrators,
including former University Pro-
vost Phil Hanlon and President
Coleman, both articulated con-
cerns in interviews in January
with The Michigan Daily with
the legal hurdles faced in imple-
menting tuition equality.
On social media platforms,
including Twitter, many have
expressed excitement with this"
development, including the
Coalition for Tuition Equality.
"The time is NOW for the
Regents to give in-state tuition to
the undocumented students who
have worked hard and braved OW
many obstacles to achieve it,"
CTE tweeted.
