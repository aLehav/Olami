The University of Michigan 

Senate 
Advisory 
Committee 

on 
University 
Affairs 
spoke 

with President Mark Schlissel 
Monday about the University’s 
sexual 
misconduct 
policy, 

the potential visit from white 
supremacist 
Richard 
Spencer 

and the Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion strategic plan. SACUA 
also discussed the upcoming 
Senate elections and ideas to 
increase faculty attendance at 
governance meetings.

Schlissel discussed his plan 

to tackle sexual misconduct 
through 
proposed 
culture 

education training. The trainings 
would aim to make faculty aware 
of 
protections 
for 
reporters 

and whistleblowers, and more 
comfortable with reporting any 
complaint or concern regarding 
social and sexual misconduct. 
He went on to endorse the hiring 
of an outside professional to 
assess how well the University 
is addressing sexual misconduct, 
and 
improving 
certain 

procedures,

CAMPUS LIFE

Following the bombings in 

Eastern Ghouta last month 
which, according to the Syrian 
Observatory 
for 
Human 

Rights, have taken the lives of 
654 civilians in the past two 
weeks, the war in Syria will 
reach its eighth year on March 
15. With more than 465,000 
Syrian lives lost in the conflict, 
University of Michigan and Ann 
Arbor activists are struggling 
to center the conflict at the 
local level while death tolls 
become astronomical. However, 
emergency responses like phone 
banks and informational rallies 
about large attacks such as the 
bombings in the eastern Ghouta 
region of Syria and various 
education events about the war 
have become a primary focus 
for activists working to make a 
difference.

LSA 
sophomore 
Ayah 

Kutmah, 
fundraising 
chair 

for 
the 
Michigan 
Refugee 

Assistance Program, is a Syrian 

immigrant 
whose 
parents 

immigrated to the United States 
over 20 years ago. Her parents 
used to take her back to Syria 
every summer to visit family. 
These visits ceased in 2011 when 
the area became too dangerous 
due to the violence and riots 
of the Arab Spring against the 
Bashar al-Assad regime.

“After the summer of 2011, 

things had escalated to a point 
where it was no longer safe 
for anyone to really go there, 
particularly if you have a 
political opinion,” she said.

During his sophomore year, 

LSA senior Yusuf Ahmed saw 
how 
perceptions 
of 
safety 

and the Syrian crisis overall 
command a very large presence 
in the news. Since the conflict’s 
inception 
during 
the 
2011 

Arab Spring in response to the 
authoritarian regime of dictator 
Bashar al-Assad, more than 
a million Syrians have been 
injured and over 12 million 
have had to leave their homes 
because of the conflict. The 
Syrian refugee crisis is now

White supremacist supporters escorted to near-empty event, 24 arrested on both sides

White supremacist Richard 

Spencer and his supporters came 
to Michigan State University 
Monday afternoon and were 
met with protesters outside the 
Pavilion for Agriculture and 
Livestock 
Education, 
where 

the event was held. In sum, two 
dozen were arrested by state and 
local authorities. 

Spencer was not invited by 

MSU to speak on their campus, 

and his initial request to do so 
was rejected by the university. 
In the rejection, the university 
cited safety concerns based on 
the “Unite the White” rally in 
Virginia that resulted in the 
death of one woman.

This 
rejection 
was 
met 

with a lawsuit against MSU by 
Cameron Padgett, a Georgia State 
University student and Spencer’s 
booking agent and legal advocate. 
Padgett won the suit, resulting in 
an agreement from MSU to allow 
Spencer to speak at the university 
on 
March 
5. 
Former 
MSU 

President Lou Anna Simon wrote 
in a statement the agreement to 
let Spencer speak was organized 
during the school’s spring break 
in order to ensure the safety of 
the student’s on campus.

“This agreement was based on 

the university’s requirement that 
the event occur on a date and at a 
venue that minimizes the risk of 
violence or disruption to campus,” 
Simon 
wrote. 
“The 
security 

of 
our 
campus 
community 

remains our top priority and all 
appropriate security measures 
will be taken in connection with 

the event. Michigan State rejects 
this group’s divisive and racist 
messages and remains committed 
to maintaining a diverse campus 
and supporting an inclusive, just 
and democratic society.”

Kyle Bristow, one of Spencer’s 

attorneys at the time, called this 
agreement a “victory for the alt-
right.” Bristow announced his 
resignation from his position 
earlier this week.

The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s chapter of the 
National Association for the 
Advancement 
of 
Colored 

People 
invited 
local 
law 

enforcement 
officers 
to 

the Afro-American Lounge 
in 
South 
Quad 
Residence 

Hall 
Monday 
evening 
to 

discuss prominent social and 
legal issues facing African 
Americans 
on 
campus. 

Students 
voiced 
their 

perspectives and questions 
regarding the treatment of 
Black individuals by police 
officers and the legal system 
— 
many 
expressed 
they 

themselves have faced undue 
suspicion that non-minorities 
aren’t subjected to.

LSA senior Isaiah Land, 

president of the University’s 
chapter of the NAACP, felt 
it was important to give 
students a chance to educate 
themselves 
and 
have 
an 

open, 
honest 
conversation 

especially given the current 
political climate.

“We wanted to be able to let 

people know what their rights 
are, what you can do, what 
you can’t do,” Land said.

A video was shown at 

the beginning about having 
“The Talk” with children 
of color. The Talk is known 
as a conversation teaching 
the 
caution 
and 
hyper-

awareness many Black and 
Brown parents impart to their 

children on dealing with law 
enforcement. Students agreed 
they were implored to be extra 
respectful and extra careful 
in order to avoid ending up 
another fatal statistic.

Eddie 
Washington 
Jr., 

executive 
director 
of 
the 

Division of Public Safety and 
Security, said he had The Talk 
with his children, and felt 
that there was an opportunity 
to still remind people of color 
that they should take pride in 
who they are.

Crystal 
James, 
DPSS 

deputy police chief, was also 
in attendance and stressed 
the importance of talking 
about the issue with family 
members and not shying away 
from the topic.

“The parent should have 

The Talk,” James said. “I can 
pay a ticket, but you can’t 
bring your kid back to life.”

An interactive quiz at the 

beginning of the meeting 
highlighted several startling 
statistics about crime and 
police 
force: 
Police 
have 

initiated force in 81 percent 

of interactions with youth 
ages 16-18. Only 308 racially 
motivated 
crimes 
were 

reported 
in 
the 
state 
of 

Michigan in 2016. However, 
82,000 
African 
Americans 

were arrested in Michigan 
during the same year.

Students told stories of 

being pulled over by police 
and having a gun drawn on 
them simply for reaching for 
their license and registration. 
Others recalled times when 
they were warned against 

The Ann Arbor City Council 

convened Monday evening to 
provide an update on the status 
of the City of Ann Arbor’s Solid 
Waste Fund, which is currently 
at a sufficient balance. The 
Environmental Commission aims 
to hire an outside consultant to 
draft the Solid Waste Fund’s five-
year plan this April. In a special 
session, the council also increased 
City Attorney Stephen Postema’s 
pay by 2.5 percent to $184,500.

The Solid Waste Plan manages 

a system for recycling collection 
financed by the Solid Waste Fund, 
an enterprise fund operating 
as a bsusiness. According to 
Councilmember 
Chip 
Smith, 

D-Ward 5, at a working session 
on 
Feb. 
22, 
the 
council’s 

Environmental 
Commission 

provided an update of the fund to 
a healthy status, which contrasted 
the original concerning numbers.

“The Solid Waste Fund balance 

had been given many projections 
showing very dire circumstances, 
but going back through the audit, 
we have been given a revised 
figure that that fund is currently

In the wake of a potential visit 

from white supremacist Richard 
Spencer, a coalition of University 
of Michigan students, faculty 
and staff have established the 
“Have Your Speech and Eat It 
Too” campaign, pledging money 
to 
organizations 
supporting 

issues such as immigrant rights, 
emergency housing for abused 
women and families in Ann Arbor 
and food injustice for the Black 
community in Detroit. The funds 
are allocated for each word spoken 
at Spencer’s Monday speech at 
Michigan State University, as 

well as his possible speech at the 
University next semester.

University 
community 

members created the campaign 
as a way to stand in solidarity 
with those who are threatened 
by Spencer’s white nationalist 
rhetoric. At the time of publication 
Monday night, the campaign 
raised $7,623 from 114 total 
donations. 

Silke-Maria Weineck, professor 

of 
German 
and 
comparative 

literature, is one of the faculty 
members involved in the campaign 
and explained the inspiration for 
the initiative came from similar 
anti-fascist protests in Wunsiedal, 
Germany, beginning in 2014, that 

were organized in response to 
an annual neo-Nazi march in the 
town. In protest, residents donated 
money for each step the neo-Nazis 
took in their city. Instead of steps, 
the initiative at the University 
will donate money based on word 
count.

“The more (Spencer) dribbles 

on with his super hateful stuff, 
the more money we can raise 
for causes that he would abhor,” 
Weineck said.

Lecturer Anne Berg, the History 

Department’s assistant director of 
undergraduate studies, is another 
faculty member involved with the 
campaign. Berg wrote in an email 
interview she hoped the campaign 

would turn the words of 
the white supremacists into 
something more positive.

“For me personally the 

most important aspect of this 
fundraiser is to not be merely 
reactive to the threats made by 
white supremacists agistators 
(sic) but to repurpose their 
provocations and their hate 
speech to support anti-racist 
work in our communities 
– to build up the strength 
of those organizations and 
groups that fight systemic 
racism and inequality on 
a daily basis,” Berg wrote. 
“What those of us involved 
in putting this together like 
about the fundraiser is that it 
is subversive – it mocks white 
supremacists and essentially 
shoves their hate speech down 
their own throats, with every 
word they speak, with every 
appearance they make, they 
are actually strengthening 
the very groups they mobilize 
against.”

Weineck also discussed the 

dilemma the University faces 
when controversial speakers 
invite themselves to speak on 

campus. She said the University 
community is faced with the 
decision of either legitimizing a 
dangerous rhetoric or staging large 
protests.

“When instigators come to 

college campuses, they set up a 
bit of a trap,” Weineck said. “If 
you just let them speak like you 
let any other speaker speak, you 
legitimize what they have to say. 
If you block them from speaking 
then you have big protests – which 
I respect by the way … It’s a bit of a 
Catch 22.”

Looking toward the future, 

Weineck said she hopes the 
campaign 
will 
offer 
support 

to minority groups who are 
marginalized 
by 
Spencer’s 

messages.

“I hope that we can really turn 

what is meant to be a very divisive 
and hateful event into a show 
of community and love even if 
that sounds a little sappy but to 
come together to say that we are 
protecting vulnerable groups from 
letting someone hate on them we 
actually turn your nasty dribble 
against you and every word you 
say will raise money for people you 
don’t think belong here,” Weineck 
said.

Berg 
shared 
Weineck’s 

sentiment and said she wants 
to see the campaign continue to 
develop.

“I hope it grows,” Berg wrote. 

“I hope it gets lots of press. I hope 
it’ll travel to wherever white 
supremacists attempt to spread 
their hateful platform of ‘white 
pride,’ ‘ethnostates’ and ‘peaceful 
ethnic cleansing’ so we can focus 
on the real work, the work to 
change our institutions and make 
our communities more inclusive, 
instead of spending our energy 
keeping Nazis off our campuses, 
out of our schools and out of our 
communities.”

universities.
The University’s Office for 

Institutional Equity’s annual 
report released in January 
showed a 40 percent increase 
from 
2016 
in 
misconduct-

related reports. The increase 
in reports may be due to the 
University’s 
revised 
policy, 

which broadened the definition 
of 
misconduct 
and 
added 

new types of allegations to be 
addressed by the policy. An 
independent 
crowd-sourced 

database of sexual misconudct 
in 
academia 
called 
the 

“whisper 
network” 
detailed 

more than a dozen incidents of 
sexual assault, harassment and 
rape perpetrated by University 
faculty members. 

Schlissel also referred to 

the outside review at the first 
Board 
of 
Regents 
meeting 

earlier this year. University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald 

later told The Daily no specific 
firm has been hired yet. 

“We want to have an outside 

expert come in,” Schlissel said 
to SACUA. “So we can say, 
‘Look, are we doing the best we 
can? Are our procedures at the 
level of other schools and our 
commitment as well?’”

SACUA Chair Robert Ortega, 

an 
associate 
professor 
of 
 

social 
work, 
brought 
up 

concerns 
from 
faculty 
 

members who are unsure if 
they should report certain 
situations, 
or 
if 
they 
are 

unintentionally 
handling 

situations 
involving 

misconduct due to lack of 
proper training.

“There’s always a concern of, 

‘Am I trained well enough?’” 
Ortega said. “‘Do I know, do 
I recognize signs or do I see 
something that I don’t fully 
understand?’ That seems to 
be one of the main concerns 
among faculty, whether we can 
recognize these situations.”

Schlissel 
referred 
to 

mandatory reporting, which 
requires faculty members to 
report situations of misconduct 
by law. He also agreed that 
more 
training 
for 
sexual 

misconduct is necessary.

“We 
need 
to 
make 
a 

commitment to have everyone 
trained to a certain level, and 
retrained,” Schlissel said.

SACUA member Joy Beatty, 

an 
associate 
professor 
of 

management studies at the 
U-M 
Dearborn 
campus, 

suggested the mentality of 
sexual misconduct reporting 
would be difficult to change 
immediately, 
even 
with 

increased training efforts.

“Culture change takes a 
 

long time,” Beatty said. “You 
can’t just send people to class 

and expect them to change.”

Schlissel 
also 
updated 

SACUA 
on 
scheduling 
a 

space for Spencer to speak on 
 

campus, 
saying 
Spencer’s 

representative 
was 
not 

interested in the date the 
University 
offered. 
He 

also 
mentioned 
Spencer’s 

appearance at Michigan State 
University on Monday after 
a 
months-long 
legal 
battle 

between Spencer’s legal team 
and MSU, highlighting the 
conflict 
MSU 
faced 
when 

representatives 
such 
as 

former MSU President Lou 
Anna Simon outwardly stated 
they didn’t want Spencer to 
 

speak on campus despite his 
eventual engagement in East 
Lansing.

He ended his discussion 

highlighting some successes 
of the Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion initiative, such as 
the Campus Climate Survey, 
Go Blue Guarantee, Wolverine 
Pathways and DEI Innovation 
Funding, which awards grants 
up 
to 
$10,000 
to 
faculty 

and students with ideas to 
improve inclusion on campus. 
Last year’s Campus Climate 
Survey found 43.8 percent of 
all underrepresented minority 
undergraduates had reported 
an instance of discrimination 
at the University.

SACUA then moved into 

status report updates on the 

proposed 
Intra-University 

Summit and the upcoming 2018 
SACUA elections.

Ortega 
provided 
results 

of a feedback survey for the 
Intra-University Summit, an 
event that will bring together 
Michigan public universities 
to address campus issues such 
as DEI efforts and sexual 
misconduct policies Schlissel 
mentioned. Seven universities 
replied 
to 
the 
survey, 
 

providing 
insight 
on 
 

potential topics to be discussed 
and 
recommended 
for 

discussion.

SACUA elections will be 

held March 19 and faculty 
governance 
members 
will 

vote to fill the three seats 
which will be vacated by 
Ortega, 
Dave 
Wright 
and 

Stefan Szymanski at the end of 
April. The members discussed 
ideas 
to 
increase 
faculty 

attendance 
at 
governance 

meetings. 
Electronic 
voting 

was one suggestion to improve 
attendance 
at 
elections. 

SACUA member Neil Marsh, 
a 
professor 
of 
biological 

chemistry, 
said 
improving 

attendance 
and 
interest 
in 

meetings among faculty will be 
a long-term project.

“We need to think long-term 

about how to interest people 
to come to Senate meetings,” 
Marsh said. “It’s not something 
we can just come up with now.”

stable,” Smith said.

With higher recycling costs 

resulting from the shutdown of the 
Materials Recovery Facility, some 
voiced concerns about longterm 
stability. However, according to 
a January report by Craig Hupy, 
public service area administrator, 
average annual revenue from 
the Solid Waste Fund measures 
approximately $14 million, and 
barring an emergency, will not 
drop significantly. In January, 
City 
Administrator 
Howard 

Lazarus 
projected 
higher 

revenues numbers for the end of 
the fiscal year than Hupy.

“The end of year balance for the 

Solid Waste Fund is forecasted 
for the end of the fiscal year to 
be $22 million,” Lazarus said. 
“There’s a drop in what’s called 
the unrestricted fund balance, 
this is at $8.5 million, but that’s 
forecasted to rebound in the 
fiscal year of 2019 to go up to $10 
million.”

Smith 
emphasized 
the 

Environmental 
Commission’s 

main focus in the coming months 
is to update the 2013-2017 Solid 
Waste Plan and draft a new five-
year plan, which would aim to 
establish a zero-waste system for 
the city.

“But 
more 
importantly, 

we spent a lot of time at that 
work session talking about the 
upcoming five-year Solid Waste 
Plan and since we’ve all been very 
involved in the recycling situation 
particularly with the condition 
of the MRF, this is all going to be 
examined in pretty great detail 
in the five-year Solid Waste Plan 
update,” he said. 

The 
Environmental 

Commission will hire an outside 
consultant to evaluate the plan’s 
current condition and ultimately 
draft a new, improved five-year 
proposal aiming for a zero-waste 
plan. 

“The selected consultant will 

prepare financial models about 
the best ways to pay for these 
things, give us guidance on how 
to move forward with the MRF 
with or without regional partners 
and give us real direction on how 
to achieve the goals we have set 

for ourselves which is becoming 
more on a path towards zero 
waste in a financially responsible 
manner,” Smith said.

Smith 
also 
highlighted 

the 
community’s 
concerns 

surrounding the revitalization of 
the MRF for future use under the 
five-year plan. 

“The 
update 
from 
staff 

included information that we 
have yet another group that 
will give us an opinion on the 
condition of the MRF and what 
it will take to make it operational 
again,” Smith said. “We expect 
that by early April we were told.”

With 
the 
guidance 
of 

the 
outside 
consultant 
and 

involvement of the Ann Arbor 
community, the drafting will 
begin in April.

“We expect to have a consultant 

on board to start the five-year 
Solid Waste Plan by mid-April and 
that will go on over the course of 
the summer and naturally there 
will be a lot of public meetings 
that we will be asking a great deal 
of input from our community on 
this plan,” Smith said.

Hupy emphasized prioritizing 

different aspects of the plan based 
on the council’s goal of zero waste.

“Part of the planning effort will 

have to be prioritization of what 
items get done first and with what 
resources,” Hupy said. “This isn’t 
an unlimited amount of money so 
you have to decide what gets done 
first so that’s why the Solid Waste 
Plan goes back through council so 
they can mold it to make sure it 
reflects their values.”

Smith emphasized the need 

for public input in order to attain 
sustainable zero waste as a 
community, since the results will 
have a significant effect on every 
resident in Ann Arbor.

“I think it’s easy to think that 

this isn’t a glamorous plan to work 
on just because it’s called Solid 
Waste Plan but I think it impacts 
every single person in the city, and 
I think there are a lot of issues we 
need to tackle on this plan so it’s 
going to be of critical importance 
to have good public engagement 
on this project,” Smith said.

widely recognized as one of the 
worst humanitarian crises of the 
current age. While Ahmed had 
been thinking about the Syrian 
civil war — then in its fifth year 
— he decided it was time to take 
action after hearing the story of 
a local imam and Syrian refugee 
who fled from his home during 
the reign of Bashar’s father, Hafez 
al-Assad.

“He put the entire audience 

in his shoes,” Ahmed said. “He 
made us understand how truly 
lonely it is and how scary it is to 
be a refugee, to leave everything 
behind, to have absolutely nothing 
besides the clothes on your back 
… I couldn’t sleep for a week 
because, to me, I was faced with 
a paradox — how could I go to 
school, take tests, go to Espresso, 
grab a coffee, knowing what 
atrocities are happening halfway 
across the world, knowing those 
atrocities aren’t in the history 
books but are happening as we 
speak?”

Inspired 
by 
that 
speech, 

Ahmed decided to start the 
Syrian 
Orphans 
Sponsorship 

Association on campus, which 
focused on orphaned children 
in the wake of the conflict. 
According to UNICEF, a total of 
11 million Syrian children have 
been displaced because of the 
civil war. From that point, SOSA 
began to grow. During the first 
semester of the organization’s 
existence, SOSA raised $5,000; 
the following year, they raised 
$10,000.

As the scope of the organization 

changed, the name followed suit. 
Now as Students Organize for 
Syria, Ahmed said attempting to 
address the crisis is not an easy 
task. He said projects such as 
medical drives, which package 
medical supplies and ship them 
to areas in need of medical care, 
clothing 
drives, 
documentary 

screenings and more play a very 
large part in increasing personal 
participation and encouraging 
individual involvement but the 
length of the crisis adds a nuance 
to organizing efforts that is 
difficult to maneuver.

“It’s tough because it seems 

sometimes, no matter how much 
you try to do, nothing changes,” 
Ahmed said. “The crisis continues 
to go on. For us, it’s really about 
looking at the impact we can have 
as individuals and that’s why 
those engagement projects are 
so important … Longevity-wise, 
that’s how we hope to continue 
to inspire students and allow 
them to continue playing a part 
regardless of how long the crisis 
is going on.”

Public 
Policy 
junior 
Zoha 

Qureshi, public relations chair 
and incoming president of SOS, 
said the three main goals of 
SOS are advocacy, education 
and fundraising. She said the 
largest hurdle when organizing 
is continuing to keep a physical 
presence on campus as the 
war reaches its eighth year of 
devastation.

“The biggest thing is reminding 

everyone this is a crisis that’s 
been going on for such a long 
time, and we just need to continue 
to push forward and do whatever 
we can in the capacity that we 
have as college students to make 
an impact and to really help out in 
any way we can,” Qureshi said.

LSA 
senior 
Zoe 
Proegler, 

co-president of the Michigan 
Refugee 
Assistance 
Program, 

said MRAP, which was founded 
in September 2016 when many 
images of refugees from Syria 
were being shared online, focuses 
their efforts on volunteering with 
refugees in the area, and advocacy 
and education events such as 
teach-ins 
and 
documentary 

screenings. She said MRAP also 
grapples with staying relevant on 
campus given the extended time 
frame in Syria.

“That’s definitely a difficulty 

that we face and have to struggle 
with,” Proegler said. “How do 
we keep people engaged and 
informed when things have been 
so bad for so long?”

As a member of MRAP, Kutmah 

said the issues around organizing 
for victims in the Syrian conflict 
involve keeping Syria in the 
collective consciousness of the 
community and inspiring people 
to work to alleviate suffering.

“In general, whenever you 

want to have a social movement 
or try to start any movement 
regarding an issue, the issue 

becomes an issue of memory 
and an issue of time,” she said. 
“When something big happens, 
it suddenly feels very pertinent. 
Everyone wants to organize and 
… the one thing social movements 
or any movements have against 
them is time because the longer 
that time lapses, the less people 
are interested and the less people 
are advocating.”

Muslim 
Community 

Association of Ann Arbor and 
Vicinity, the local mosque near 
North Campus, has been recently 
responding to and promoting 
educational efforts on the war 
in Syria for its members and 
Ann Arbor residents, but faces 
similar issues as the campus 
organizations. MCA President 
Habib Hamidi said the war in Syria 
doesn’t have the convenience of 
organizing around a single issue. 
Hamidi cited rallies demanding 
the removal of troops during the 
Iraq War as a crisis that can call 
for one specific outcome while 
the Syrian civil war does not have 
an easily digestible conclusion.

“There is no end in sight and 

there isn’t one particular action 
that you can sort of advocate for,” 
Hamidi said. “We just try to say 
‘Hey, we just have to do our part’ 
and … As long as everybody does 
their part and raises their voice, 
then collectively we can have an 
effect.”

Kutmah said these specific 

points of protest allow for a very 
large presence on campus, but 
since the conflict has continued 
to ravage Syria for almost eight 
years, these rallying points are 
too far and few between for a 
continued activist effort.

“You’ll have rallying points 

like, for example, when chemical 
weapons were used or in Aleppo 
or right now you have eastern 
Ghouta but for the most part, 
there’s no continued activism by 
a large group of people,” she said.

In the past month, activism 

for Syria has become much more 
visible on campus and in Ann 
Arbor given the bombings in 
eastern Ghouta, which began 
in late February. The last rebel-
controlled 
area 
near 
Syria’s 

capital, 
the 
104-square 
mile 

district, which is home to about 
400,000 Syrian civilians, has 
been under heavy fire from the 

al-Assad’s regime since 2013. Last 
month, a large bombing campaign 
began in the region and, according 
to the Syrian Observatory for 
Human Rights, 654 civilians have 
been killed in the past two weeks 
as part of the attacks.

 
On 
Monday, 
the 
United 

Nations Human Rights Council 
adopted a resolution calling for 
an investigation into the bombing 
campaign in eastern Ghouta, 
as well as a failed ceasefire 
two weeks ago. United Nations 
Secretary-General 
António 

Guterres said it was “high time 
to stop this hell on earth” at the 
HRC’s opening session.

SOS, MRAP and MCA stepped 

up organizing in response to the 
crisis. SOS held an emergency 
phone bank in the Michigan Union 
on Thursday, February 22, where 
students 
could 
contact 
their 

state and federal representatives, 
asking them to take a stand and 
pass legislation condemning the 
attacks in Ghouta.

“Our goal is really for (the 

representatives) 
to 
publicly 

recognize the fact that this is 
going on because that’s something 
that I didn’t really see in any US 
news outlets,” Qureshi said. “I 
woke up Thursday (February 22) 
… I get the New York Times and 
get newsletters emailed to me 
every morning and I didn’t see 
any word of that and it just felt 
kind of weird like it’s not even 
being talked about.”

Proegler 
said 
MRAP 
has 

worked with SOS on events in 
the past and supported the phone 
bank method, saying it not only 
allows students to get involved 
with the organization but also to 
contribute to the collective goal 
of bringing attention to the crisis.

“When you’re able to give 

members things to do like call 
your representatives and advocate 
for this specific change, it allows 
them to feel more involved and 
actually taking steps to mitigate 
the crisis and it does make a 
difference,” Proegler said.

MCA, on the other hand, 

concentrated their efforts on a 
physical educational presence, 
staging an “Interfaith Rally for 
Syria” in front of the Ann Arbor 
Post Office Friday, February 23. 
MCA member Dr. Mohammad 

AlAzem, who helped pass out 
flyers on the Ghouta bombings 
with 
information 
on 
how 

members of the public could 
contact their representatives, said 
he believes it is his job to spread 
the word about the crisis in Syria 
to those who may not know about 
it.

“I (have been) living in Ann 

Arbor now for the past 29 years 
and … My duty as originally 
Syrian (and) American is to 
educate the public,” AlAzem said 
in an interview after the event.

Hamidi 
said 
an 
element 

of 
MCA’s 
organizing 
efforts 

is getting members involved 
in 
the 
democratic 
process 

through rallies and educational 
demonstrations such as the one 
he and AlAzem organized and 
attended.

However, a large issue for these 

organizers comes when there 
are lulls between large events to 
rally behind. Qureshi said staying 
relevant on campus is a struggle 
when there isn’t an emergency 
like Ghouta for members to 
interact with and for students to 
learn about.

“(We’re) 
periodically 
just 

having different kinds of events 
to show that we are active and we 
are continuously doing things,” 
Qureshi said. “We just want to 
continuously have events like 
bi-weekly 
just 
so 
(students) 

know that our presence is there 
on campus … One of our goals 
is spreading awareness about 
the campaign so we want to be 
able to make sure that as many 
University of Michigan students 
as possible know about what’s 
happening there and know that 
they can do something about it 
too.”

Another issue Ahmed and 

Proegler addressed with their 
respective 
organizations 
is 

reaching out to new students 
who aren’t already involved with 
the issue. When an issue such 
as Syria is addressed, Ahmed 
said a specific crowd of involved 
students is drawn to their events. 
While he said this base is good, 
there are more students at the 
University that might not know 
about the war. He said these are 
the populations SOS is working to 
interact with.

“Population 
penetration 
is 

something that we’ve been looking 
at pretty deeply,” Ahmed said. 
“We’ve 
actually 
implemented 

an expansion manager and an 
outreach manager, that’s on and 
off-campus communication so 
that we’re not just reaching out 
to more orgs on campus, whether 
that’s 
fraternities, 
sororities, 

different volunteer clubs, but 
also to the larger Ann Arbor 
population.”

MRAP has been working to 

create more cross-organizational 
communication as well to tackle 
the issue of the same people 
attending their events. Proegler 
said by collaborating with other 
organizations on campus, more 
students can get involved and a 
larger impact can be made.

“As we see broader coalitions 

forming sort of across a range of 
social and political issues, we’re 
definitely benefiting from some 
of that energy of people wanting 
to reach out and get involved with 
stuff that might be kind of outside 
of their realm of expertise or their 
focus as a service organization 
or as an affinity group but we’ve 
definitely been seeing people 
remain interested and engaged,” 
Proegler said. “As much as this 
isn’t something that has an end 
date in sight, I find a lot of hope in 
people who are still coming out to 
events (and) still taking action.”

In his own experience with 

organizing, Hamidi said MCA 
is working to stage more public 
events and reach out to members 
of 
all 
backgrounds 
in 
the 

community to increase education 
efforts and hopefully help the 
victims of this crisis.

“What I think is most effective 

is getting out in the streets and 
basically interacting with people 
one-on-one and trying to have a 
conversation with them,” Hamidi 
said. “Especially with a long 
conflict, when you do any type 
of rally or anything like that, 
people are desensitized to what 
you’re talking about, especially 
when they hear the word ‘Syria’ 
because it’s such a long conflict so 
I think one-on-one interactions 
and listening to people … is 
refreshing to me.”

matter what and to take other 
precautions when dealing with 
cops.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Peighton Childress is a member 
of 
the 
NAACP 
University 

chapter and was glad the groups 
were able to get together and 
have a productive conversation 
about the matter.

“I think this is a really good 

event to have considering the 
climate in the country right 
now,” Childress said. “I think 
it’s important to let (people) 

know that there are (those) 
who aren’t on the negative 
when it comes to their safety 
with police.”

The discussion emphasized 

the importance of building 
relations between community 
members and law enforcement.

Orlando 
Simon, 
Student 

Legal 
Services 
attorney, 

explained how respect toward 
police 
was 
important 
to 

practice for everyone, but that 
the effects were magnified 
for 
minorities. 
Simon 
felt 

that fostering a relationship 
between police and citizens is 
crucial for helping understand 
one other better.

“I think bringing people 

together is always a good 

thing,” Simon said. “It’s easy 
to go in (a courtroom) and look 
at the police as the other side 
… But I find, over the years, 
a greater difference is the 
relationships. It’s crucial to 
bring law enforcement into the 
dialogue.”

Many 
students 
were 

concerned that even knowing 
your 
rights 
and 
doing 

everything right might not be 
enough to protect their life. 
They cited cases like that of 
Sandra Bland, who was found 
dead in a jail cell after she was 
pulled over for a minor traffic 
violation. Some students asked 
the panel what change they can 
expect, if any.

Washington 
had 
some 

advice for such students who 
felt disillusioned about their 
ability to change the status 
quo. He explained during an 
altercation, people have to 
do what they can to remain 
safe. However, he encouraged 
speaking 
out 
and 
writing 

complaints 
to 
the 
police 

department after the fact.

“Don’t 
believe 
nothing 

happened,” Washington said. 
“Just by making some noise, 
you’re helping yourself … and 
officers too. It’s one incident 
at a time. We can’t police 
without you as partners, and I 
don’t think the problem can be 
solved without us as partners … 
This is how we get better.”

Reign of chaos

A letter from MVision

C

haos once again returned 
to the White House this 
past 
week 

with 
the 
sudden 

resignation of Hope 
Hicks, White House 
communications 
director, 
in 
the 

wake of news that 
she 
testified 
to 

Congress that part 
of the job entailed 
telling 
“white 

lies” on President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

behalf. Hicks was Trump’s 
fourth 
communications 

director in the span of barely 
a year in office, but more 
importantly, 
Hicks 
was 
a 

loyal and trusted member of 
Trump’s inner circle.

Her stunning departure 

serves as an indication that 
the Trump administration’s 
unprecedented 
streak 
of 

attrition — which has seen 
the exit of Chief Strategist 
Steve 
Bannon, 
Chief 
of 

Staff Reince Priebus, Press 
Secretary Sean Spicer and 
many others — is far from 
over. 
A 
day 
after 
Hicks 

announced her resignation, 
NBC 
News 
reported 
that 

National 
Security 
Adviser 

H.R. 
McMaster 
will 
be 

replaced within the month 
at the behest of Defense 
Secretary James Mattis and 
John 
Kelly, 
White 
House 

chief of staff. That same day, 
news broke that Kelly, at 
Trump’s request, is planning 
to remove Ivanka Trump and 
Jared Kushner from their 
official advisor roles. 

Kelly 
was 
supposed 

to provide order when he 
was hired last summer, but 
instead, the White House 
has fractured further under 
his direction. Kelly himself 
was recently embroiled in 
controversy over his handling 
of domestic abuse allegations 
against former White House 
aide Rob Porter, which Kelly 
ignored for months, only firing 
Porter after the accusations 
leaked to the media.

Amid 
this 
frenzy 
of 

attrition, 
speculation 
and 

scandal, one thing is clear: 
Trump’s 
White 
House 
is 

engulfed 
in 
turmoil, 
the 

repercussions of which flared 
brightly 
this 
past 
week. 

Trump has long been known to 
flip-flop on policy positions, 
expressing 
contradictory 

views on topics ranging from 
immigration to taxation to 
abortion 
throughout 
his 

campaign and first year in 

office, but he outdid himself 
last week on gun control. At 

a televised meeting 
with senators and 
congressman from 
both parties, Trump 
praised 
proposals 

to 
establish 

comprehensive 
background 
checks on all gun 
purchases 
and 

to raise the age 
to 
buy 
assault 

weapons to 21. In a 

surreal moment, Trump even 
expressed openness to a ban 
on assault weapons. Yet, in 
an ironic twist, after chiding 
Republican 
lawmakers 
for 

being “afraid of” the NRA, 
Trump 
met 
with 
NRA 

lobbyists and rescinded his 
support for the gun control 
measures he had praised just 
a day earlier.

Trump’s 
inconsistency 

on 
guns 
confused 
and 

exasperated leaders of both 
parties, 
but 
was 
quickly 

overshadowed when Trump 
declared 
his 
intention 
to 

introduce 
tariffs 
on 
steel 

and 
aluminum 
imports. 

Such a move would violate 
existing 
trade 
agreements 

and 
indubitably 
lead 
to 

retaliatory 
measures 
from 

other countries that could 
easily spiral into a costly and 
disastrous trade war.

The reaction to Trump’s 

tariff plan was swift and 
harsh. 
Leaders 
of 
both 

parties quickly rebuked the 
idea, global leaders blasted 
Trump and the stock market 
plunged. 
However, 
amid 

this 
widespread 
criticism, 

Trump doubled down and 
tweeted that trade wars are 
“good” and “easy to win.” 
That’s blatantly false, and 
the fact that no one in the 
White House has conveyed to 
Trump the threat a trade war 
poses to the U.S. economy is 
rather alarming.

Trump’s 
eventful 
week 

culminated 
with 
renewed 

scrutiny 
over 
his 
neglect 

to 
fill 
dozens 
of 
vacant 

positions, 
including 
41 

ambassadorships. 
Critical 

allies 
and 
strategic 

partners like South Korea, 
Germany, Saudi Arabia and 
the 
European 
Union 
are 

among 
the 
countries 
and 

organizations that currently 
lack 
an 
American 
chief 

diplomat. When considering 
the 
current 
geopolitical 

climate around the world, it is 
astounding that some of these 
positions have yet to be filled. 
Given the tensions on the 
Korean peninsula, appointing 
an ambassador to South Korea 
should be a priority, but to 
the Trump administration, it 
is an afterthought.

It is no coincidence that 

a week of internal White 
House chaos coincided with 
one of Trump’s most volatile 
weeks in the policy sphere. 
Trump’s 
advisers 
appear 

incapable of providing astute 
advice, a problem that is 
likely compounded by the 
constant attrition plaguing 
the White House. In the 
absence of stability, Trump 
appears to have adopted a 
strategy of going off-script 
and reversing positions as 
he pleases, knowing that his 
public statements have little 
correlation to the policy his 
administration executes. This 
inconsistency 
compounds 

government 
inaction, 
as 

evidenced by Trump’s gun 
policy flip-flopping, and leads 
to impulsive decisions like 
these new proposed tariffs.

Order 
must 
be 

established 
in 
the 
White 

House. At present, Trump’s 
administration is the most 
disorganized, dysfunctional 
and, 
at 
times, 
utterly 

incompetent administration 
in modern American history. 
The 
chaos 
plaguing 
the 

White 
House 
muddles 

the 
president’s 
legislative 

priorities, devalues the U.S.’s 
image abroad and weakens the 
credibility of the institution 
of the presidency. It often is 
tempting to dismiss the White 
House drama as meaningless 
or 
even 
entertaining, 
but 

weeks like this past one 
demonstrate the significant 
consequences of an executive 
branch drowning in chaos.

DANIEL GREENE AND IZZY BAER | OP-ED

T

o Our Fellow Wolverines,

As 
new 
Central 

Student 
Government 

parties form and elections fast 
approach, we wanted to take a 
minute, amid of our marathon 
meetings 
and 
late-night 

platform talks, to discuss what 
matters most: the students 
that make up the University of 
Michigan’s campus. It’s with a 
dedication to creating a better 
and more unified campus that 
we announce our candidacy 
as Student Body President and 
Vice President with the newly 
formed MVision party.

Having collectively spent 

time working with and on 
Central Student Government 
(CSG), 
LSA 
Student 

Government (LSA SG), Center 
for 
Campus 
Involvement 

(CCI), 
Wolverine 
Support 

Network (WSN), LSA Honor 
Council, 
Counseling 
and 

Psychological Services (CAPS), 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center (SAPAC), 
Panhellenic 
Association 

and Interfraternity Council 
(IFC) we have no shortage 
of acronyms, nor time spent 
listening to, debating with and 
working for the greater student 
body. We understand the huge 
potential 
and 
astounding 

responsibilities of the offices 
we hope to hold. We also know 
the shortcomings of CSG and 
the pitfalls of overpromising 
that have been made clear 
over our semesters on campus. 
The changes we wish to bring 
about are manifold, but our 
vision is clear: to create a CSG 
that serves the entire student 
body. Ultimately, we want a 
CSG that empowers students 
to be seen, to be heard and to 
be supported. 

The eMerge party ran with 

the desire to build a more 
accessible, inclusive student 
government, and we are proud 
to have been a part of that 

campaign. 
CSG 
President 

Anushka 
Sarkar 
and 
CSG 

Vice President Nadine Jawad 
have done a phenomenal job 
providing our campus with 
hope and a sense of belonging 
for communities that CSG had 
previously alienated. We hope 
to continue their impactful 
work 
by 
expanding 
CSG’s 

outreach to communities who 
still feel isolated on campus.

We will not be distracted 

from CSG’s mission to serve 
students. It is imperative that 
CSG becomes a group dedicated 
to providing resources for 
the 
student 
organizations 

that create the richness of 
our campus. Let’s allow those 
organizations to shine in their 
own right, indebted only to 
the students and causes that 
they serve. We created a team 
with the intention of building 
a platform based on direct 
experience 
and 
expanding 

CSG’s outreach. The range 
of CSG experience that our 
team brings has allowed our 
platform to reflect the varying 
communities 
and 
concerns 

from across our campus.

We 
have 
experienced, 

firsthand, policies that need 
to be improved to allow for a 
campus where each student 
is 
valued. 
The 
MVision 

Michigan team is comprised 
of students who understand 
what it means to be openly gay 
in Greek life, to be a woman 
on a college campus today, to 
struggle with mental illness, 
to survive sexual assault, to 
balance work-study positions 
or to feel unsafe because of 
their 
identities. 
However, 

we 
understand 
that 
our 

experiences do not speak for 
the 46,000 voices that make 
up the University. We hope to 
increase the representation of 
all marginalized and invisible 
identities within classrooms 
and campus resources. We 

hope to replace “freshmen” 
with “first-years,” and other, 
more inclusive, terminology. 
We plan to embed a SAPAC 
ex-officio in CSG to connect 
the University with the needs 
of survivors on campus.

No student should feel 

alone as they struggle with 
mental health, which is why 
we need to reach the golden 
ratio of CAPS counselors to 
students. No student who is 
a survivor of sexual assault 
should be unsure of their 
options, which is why we 
need to expand the SAPAC 
empowerment 
fund. 
No 

student on campus should feel 
isolated or disenfranchised, 
which is why we need to 
proactively 
address 
the 

campus climate. That is where 
our CSG philosophy stems 
from. Our experiences have 
shaped 
our 
determination, 

and our willingness to go the 
extra mile.

We are honored to work 

with 
brilliant 
individuals 

from across the communities 
that represent the breadth 
of 
experience 
here 
on 

the 
University 
campus. 

MVision is actively creating 
a community that promotes 
equity and acceptance and 
works at a grassroots level to 
pursue inclusivity.

If you have policy ideas 

that you believe will elevate 
students 
on 
this 
campus,

you to feel heard.

I 

was hopeless about gun 
control. Until now.

Another mass shooting. 

Over a dozen children dead. 
Prayers 
from 
both 
sides. 

Arguments about restricting 
guns. Rebukes from the NRA. 
You’ve heard and seen all of 
this before. In many ways, we 
had become so jaded to this 
process, I truly felt like we 
had lost hope. I, like many 
of us, had begun to feel that 
there was nothing that could 
be done. This being said, I’ve 
found some hope from those 
students advocating for gun 
control at Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School.

You’ve 
likely 
heard 
a 

variety of jarring statistics, 
but let me provide a reminder: 
Nearly 
one 
in 
four 
have 

been threatened with a gun 
in their lifetime or have 
a family member who has 
been threatened. And this 
is even worse for minority 
communities: nearly a third 
of African-Americans have 
reported that they or their 
families have been threatened 
by gun violence. Whether 
it’s being threatened with 
a gun or regarding actual 
shootings, we can see that 
there has been little change 
in gun violence: 10 of the 
15 deadliest shootings have 
occurred in the past 10 years.

I 
am 
likely 
preaching 

to the choir, unfortunately, 
despite the fact that nearly 
nine out of 10 Americans 
want 
more 
regulation 
on 

guns— specifically, common-
sense legislation that includes 
restrictions on those with 
mental 
illnesses 
having 

access to guns as well as 
more 
thorough 
background 

checks. 
These 
legislative 

proposals have high support 
across party lines, and most 
people support ending private, 
unlicensed sales of firearms 
(colloquially known as the 
“gun show loophole”). Still, 
there has yet to be legislation 
that is representative of the 
will of the people. This is a 
true testament to the NRA 
and the number of officials 
that have received funding 

from them for their political 
campaigns. Here in Michigan, 
nine legislators have received 
funding 
from 
the 
NRA’s 

political 
action 
committee 

funds — unsurprisingly, all are 
members of the Republican 
Party, which has prevented 
gun control legislation from 
being enacted.

I had truly become so 

jaded to the cycle of thoughts 
and 
prayers, 
followed 
by 

the inundation of statistics 
and 
descriptions 
of 
the 

propagators of gun violence, 
and, finally, inaction from our 
legislative body. That is until 
I saw and heard from the kids 
at Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School. A high school 
senior, Emma Gonzalez spoke 
out against the inaction of 
government officials regarding 

gun control legislation.

“Politicians who sit in their 

gilded House and Senate seats 
funded by the NRA telling us 
nothing could have been done to 
prevent this, we call B.S.,” she 
said. “That us kids don’t know 
what we’re talking about, that 
we’re too young to understand 
how the government works. We 
call B.S.”

I think it’s important to 

note that she is younger than 
all or nearly all of us here at 
the University of Michigan. It 
bears repeating that, despite 
the fact that she has yet to enter 
college, she is likely doing 
more than most of us regarding 
gun control legislation. While 
I’m sure many of us students 
are feeling upset about the 
recent events, I question if we 
have been willing to do what it 
takes to change the discourse 

surrounding gun control into 
tangible legislative action. It’s 
these kids who are starting 
protests, 
who 
are 
raising 

money and who are putting 
in the energy to take these 
concerns and grow them into 
national outcries in ways that 
I’m not sure I’ve seen before.

These young activists have 

pioneered the #NeverAgain 
movement. In doing so, they 
have 
raised 
nearly 
three 

million dollars in support of 
gun control legislation. In 
many ways, their protests and 
their voices have elevated the 
conversations in ways that 
an average person cannot. 
For 
the 
American 
public, 

and our legislators, having to 
hear from children who had 
to experience the effects of 
gun violence has seemingly 
turned 
the 
conversation 

in unexpected ways. Just 
the 
other 
day, 
President 

Donald 
Trump 
announced 

some 
tentative 
support 

for 
increasing 
background 

checks, surprising officials 
and 
virtually 
all 
of 
the 

American community. There 
is still hope that we can make 
the change, but, if there is to 
be effective legislation, those 
in support of gun control 
cannot let up now. If we are 
to pursue legislation, support 
can’t simply be just from the 
#NeverAgain 
individuals. 

It can’t be just from the 
victims of shootings. It has 
to be from every individual 
in the American government 
speaking out on what may 
be one of the larger issues of 
our time. What I now know, 
however, is that there is still 
hope for us to enact common-
sense 
legislation 
for 
guns. 

Maybe it won’t be tomorrow 
— it might not even be within 
the coming year — but if we 
continue to ratchet up the 
pressure 
on 
our 
officials 

and suggest how to fix this 
problem, we can ensure that 
fewer individuals die from gun 
shootings and that kids can go 
to school believing in the safety

‘Annihilation’ takes on 
more than it can handle

In the late 2010s, science 
fiction 
as 
a 
film 
genre 
has 
seen 
something 
of 
a 
renaissance, 
with 
critically 
acclaimed releases such as 
2016’s 
“Arrival.” 
The 
film 
is an excellent example of 
the genre’s ability to touch 
on complex, profound ideas 
through 
intensely 
personal 
human 
stories. 
Director 
Alex Garland seemed to have 
tapped into this concept with 
his 2015 directorial debut, “Ex 
Machina.” Garland displayed 
a unique tact for developing 
characters 
in 
fascinating 
ways, all the while tying those 
characters up in the story 
being told. Garland’s follow-up 
release, 2018’s “Annihilation” 
seemed set to be another 
example of intense, character-
driven science fiction. 
The film tells the story of 
Lena (Natalie Portman, “Song 
to 
Song”), 
an 
ex-military 
biologist whose husband, Kane 
(Oscar Isaac, “Star Wars: The 
Last Jedi”), suddenly reappears 
after having vanished for more 
than a year into The Shimmer, 
a 
mysterious 
jungle 
that 
appeared on a United States 
coastline after a meteor strike. 
When it becomes apparent 
that The Shimmer left Kane 
terminally ill, Lena teams 
up with four other scientists 
— all of them women — to 
investigate The Shimmer in 
hopes of finding a cure.
Unfortunately, 
the 
result 
is a mixed bag. Perhaps the 
film’s 
greatest 
hindrance 
is 
its 
ambition. 
Over 
its 
runtime, it becomes apparent 
that the film was adapted 
from a novel, lacking the 
room to breathe and explore 
characters and ideas that a 
book offers. In just two hours, 
the film must characterize and 
develop all five of its scientist 

protagonists, tell a compelling 
story and touch on concepts 
concerning what it means to 
be human. As a result of its 
extensive to-do list, the film 
ends up accomplishing none of 
these things outright. 

The area where this is most 
apparent is in its characters; 
simply put, the film lacks 
heart. 
Alex 
Garland’s 
last 
film, “Ex Machina” was able 
to devote ample screentime 
to developing its three-person 
cast. With five characters to 
juggle — six including Kane 
— Garland struggles to find a 
way to make us care about the 
characters. The film reaches 
its emotional peak about five 
minutes in as we see Lena 
tearfully paint the bedroom she 
once shared with her missing, 
presumed-dead husband while 
listening to Crosby, Stills & 
Nash’s “Helplessly Hoping.” 
It’s a tender and moving 
scene, but one that ultimately 
leaves a bitter taste in your 
mouth, because this is the 
most we’re going to get in 
terms of characterization for 
Lena. She, and the other four 
scientists investigating The 
Shimmer, are characterized 
almost exclusively by their 
past trauma. The film lacks 
either the time or the will to 
make its characters anything 
more than shallow archetypes. 
Despite 
this, 
there 
are 
flashes 
of 
brilliance 
throughout. 
The 
film’s 
third 
act, 
titled 
“The 
Lighthouse,” is some of the 
most breathtakingly stunning 
filmmaking this year. This 
is where the film rolls up its 

sleeves and flexes its muscles, 
showing 
its 
audience 
the 
payoff of all the tension and 
mystery it had been building 
up. There are select scenes 
throughout 
“Annihilation” 
that serve as the gold standard 
for drawing audiences in. The 
film caused me to physically 
react on numerous occasions; 
my jaw hung open, I gasped, I 
covered my mouth in awe. In 
terms of building visceral, gut-
twisting situations, Garland 
proves himself as a master.
In the end, however, this 
isn’t enough to distract from 
the fact that the film doesn’t 
come close to satisfying in 
the end. “Annihilation” poses 
some 
massive 
questions 
concerning 
human 
nature, 
individuality and death, but 
ultimately fails to answer — or 
even address — these concepts 
in any meaningful capacity. 
Garland 
is 
aware 
these 
questions exist because the 
film actively strives to avoid 
addressing 
them. 
Instead, 
it 
feigns 
profundity 
with 
intense visual spectacles and 
vague dialogue that seem to 
trick audiences into thinking 
they’ve witnessed something 
meaningful. Films that ask 
big questions don’t necessarily 
have to answer them, but 
they have to give audiences 
something substantive. By the 
end of “Annihilation,” it felt 
like the film had thrown up its 
hands and shrugged.
Ultimately, it isn’t a bad film. 
You’ll see some crazy stuff, 
but it won’t teach you much of 
anything; that doesn’t make it 
bad, but it is a disappointing 
offering 
from 
a 
director 
who’s proven he can balance 
substance and shock value in 
the past. At times absolutely 
brilliant and at times shallow 
and glib, “Annihilation” feels 
like it’s constantly reaching for 
some kind of profundity which, 
despite trying in an intense 
and spectacular fashion, it 
never truly manages.

The 
debate 
over 
this 
country’s best slice of pizza 
is as contested and heated as 
the partisan political debates 
plaguing our society intensely 
in the 21st century. Democrat 
or 
Republican? 
Pro-life 
or 
pro-choice? 
Gun 
control? 
Immigration? 
Education? 
Where can you get the best 
pizza around here?
The 
question: 
What 
is 
the best slice of pizza in 
the 
country? 
At 
the 
very 
least, despite its vicious and 
aggressive implications, this 
debate 
consistently 
ends 
positively, due to a mandatory 
post debate taste test in order 
to truly come to some sort of 
conclusion. It’s a debate that 
brings people together over a 
slice of pizza — because at the 
end of the day, there’s no such 
thing as bad pizza (unless you’re 
on the West Coast, then maybe 
reevaluate). It’s necessary that 
time and time again we have 
this pizza conversation, one 
of great magnitude and vital 
necessity.
Take this as a state of the 
union address for ’za — a state 
of the slice address, if you will. 
The 
Chicago 
deep 
dish, 
“Detroit” style pie and, of 
course, 
the 
famous 
New 
York slice all have cult-like 
followings — groups of people 
devoted to the locationally 
specific style of ’za that they 
hail as this country’s “best 
slice.” But anyone who knows 
anything about food at all 
knows that the New York slice 
is superior.
People that believe that any 
pizza is better than New York 
pizza have A) never been to 
New York B) are confused or 
C) are clearly wrong. Pizza was 
introduced to New York in 1905 
by Gennaro Lombardi who saw 
it as the solution to not wasting 
the day old bread in his grocery 
store. 
Lombardi’s 
genius 
sparked an energetic revolution 
for the city that never sleeps, 
making 
pizza 
a 
ubiquitous 
staple of the New York streets.
New York pizza is notorious. 
It is scientifically proven that 
the water in New York is quite 
literally better for making pizza 
dough than anywhere else in 
the United States. Supposedly, 
Frank Sinatra, Hoboken native, 
had New York water shipped 
out to the west coast biweekly 
in the 1940s to make edible 
pizza when he wasn’t close to 
home.
There 
are 
32,000 
pizza 
places in New York City, lining 
each street corner — all at once 
similar and incredibly unique. 
New York pizza is the pizza that 
began the slice industry, selling 
pizza by the slice instead of 
by the full pie, making ’za 
an individual experience. A 
casual moment. A stop by or a 
game time choice instead of a 
planned and plotted, also often 
shared, full pie. Opening the 
opportunity for small human 
moments in the interaction 
that takes place during the 
transaction of a lunch slice, a 
snack slice, a serendipity slice.
Pizza in New York is in 
high demand, and there are an 
abundance of options available 
to New Yorkers and visitors 
alike. Due to the variety of 
pizza places, New York pizza 
is a situational concept. What 
I mean by that is that one can 
always determine where to 
get pizza in New York based 
on 
their 
unique 
situation. 
There’s 
a 
major 
difference 
between your classic 2:00 a.m. 
late-night drunk slice, your 
“I need my suburban parents 
to meet my new significant 
other and like them” slice and 
your important-meeting-with-
people-that-I-have-to-have-
my-shit-together-for 
slice. 
That’s what makes the New 
York pizza scene so special: 
There’s 
a 
slice 
for 
every 
occasion. The breakup slice, 
the hangry slice, the first date 
slice, the quick slice, the fancy 
slice, the just married slice, 

the I have time to stand on a 
30 minute slice, the celebratory 
slice.
In terms of specific New 
York and East Coast slices, 
you can say I’m relatively well 
versed. As a pizza connoisseur 
who was raised by a pizza 
messiah, I take pizza very 
seriously. 
Everyone 
in 
my 
family does, and the red Italian 
imported pizza oven sitting 
on our kitchen countertop is 
testament to just that. On a 
recent trip to New York, I had 
the pleasure of visiting my 
favorite spots to share some 
intimate moments with my 
favorite slices. A group of slices 
with which I have reliable and 
dependable relationships. The 
physical sensation is always 
great, and emotionally, we just 
connect.
Joe and Pat’s, a Staten Island 
pizzeria, is a firm 10. The three 
chefs crank out approximately 
500 pizzas on any given Friday 
to the beats of funky ’80s 
music. The customers bring 
vibrance and diversity to the 
old-fashioned 
atmosphere. 
I recommend sitting at the 
counter with a blood orange 
San Pellegrino and a plain pie, 

about noon on a Friday, for 
the full experience. The plain 
pie is to die for, its circles of 
mozzarella 
memorable, 
the 
dash of romano to finish, a 
hot take, but in my opinion, a 
blessing. The sauce is young, 
punchy and sweet, a perfect 
pairing to the flaky, crisp crust. 
The crust of a Joe and Pat’s 
plain pie is arguably the best 
pizza crust in the country, if 
not the world. Its crust is its 
magic and the exact vehicle 
that allows customers to eat 
an entire pie in one sitting. It’s 
light, it’s romantic, it’s easy. It’s 
the reliable guy your parents 
love and you can always depend 
on. Joe and Pat’s is a dream 
slice, one that puts Staten 
Island on the map as more than 
a New Yorker’s punching bag.
A wise pizza lover once 
told me that in order to be 
a perfect 10, the slice has to 
pass the most important pizza 
taste test: You must be able to 
taste each ingredient; sauce, 
dough, cheese. On the opposite 
end of the spectrum from Joe 
and Pat’s skinny little slice of 
heaven is Brother’s Pizzeria 
Sicilian slice. Down the road 
from Joe and Pat’s, Brother’s is 
close in distance but miles away 
in style. Its thick, deep dish 
crust is a textural journey — 
crispy, doughy, flaky and thick. 
Its stretchy mozzarella and 
zesty, peppery sauce cratered 
between the soft pillows of 
dough make a home in your 
mouth. Unlike Joe and Pat’s, 
one slice of Brother’s Sicilian 
is plenty. But that doesn’t mean 
you should stop at one, because 
clearly, you need at least two 
slices to get a true gauge on the 
quality of slice.
A 
whole 
borough 
away, 
tucked into a little no-frills 
corner of Brooklyn, is quite 
possibly 
the 
best 
slice 
in 
the country: Di Fara. The 

pizzeria makes one of the most 
sought after slices in New 
York City, a two hour line of 
hungry 
customers 
spilling 
onto the sidewalk awaiting 
the enlightenment of a pricey 
five dollar slice day after 
day. Domenic DeMarco, the 
shop’s owner (also known as 
Jesus to his loyal disciples), 
stands unaffected by the daily 
commotion, 
over 
crackling 
round pies, slicing basil onto 
their exteriors with a pair of 
kitchen scissors. When I was 
four years old, my father took 
me for my first slice of Di Fara 
pizza, 
and 
simultaneously 
awakened me from the dark 
world I’d been living in without 
it. To my chagrin, but not 
surprise, I apparently stood 
up on the counter, in my young 
impatience and beckoned at the 
72-year-old DeMarco: “Excuse 
me, mister, where’s our pizza?”
We didn’t wait much longer 
after that.
Di Fara was worth the 
wait then, and it still is now. 
DeMarco uses San Marzano 
tomatoes, the most famous 
plum tomato to come out of 
Italy, and I’d deem this a power 
move. His sauce is tangy yet 
delicate, the imported Italian 
buffalo mozzarella cheese its 
perfect pair. DeMarco is the 
only person who makes the 
pizza, which contributes to the 
ridiculous line, and also the 
notoriety of the famous slice. 
Di Fara pizza is the type of slice 
you wish to never end — it’s a 
head over heels, hot romance. 
It’s balanced in the way pizza 
should be, and its simplicity is 
nothing short of outstanding.
A few subway stops away 
is Marta in NoMad, a special, 
newer addition to my list. Marta 
specializes in pizza of the 
Roman style, which is funny, 
being that nobody ever goes 
to Rome for the pizza. Sure, 
Rome has pizza, and yes, a lot 
of it is good, but it’s no Naples. 
Marta, however, celebrates the 
extra thin crust of a typical 
Roman pizza. Of course, thin 
crust pizza in New York is no 
shock, but the pizza at Marta 
is notably thin. It’s comparable 
to a thin cracker that doesn’t 
crumble, a perfect vessel for its 
fresh toppings. Most wonderful 
of 
these 
toppings 
is 
the 
homemade pulled stracciatella 
cheese, which I’d call a gift to 
pizza. Other notable Marta 
’za’s include the egg, grated 
pecorino, potato and guanciale 
masterpiece (a deconstructed 
Carbonara sauce finding home 
on a pizza) and a personal 
favorite of mine, the absolutely 
worth-it 60-dollar tartufo nero, 
which is topped with shaved 
Italian truffles. Marta is your 
fancier slice indeed, but we all 
need to feel fancy and sharp 
now and again.
Rounding out my New York 
slice list at number five is 
Staten Island’s best known 
pizzeria, Denino’s. Opened in 
1937, the little brick building on 
the northern end of the island is 
at once both a tourist attraction 
and “the spot” for locals. 
Though I am a firm believer 
that the plain pizza is the only 
kind of pizza any of us should 
be eating — Denino’s changes 
the game and tests my long-
standing loyalty to the plain 
pie. The trademark “M.O.R” 
pie, is the must order here. 
It’s a simple romance between 
meatball, ricotta and onion 
that puts Denino’s on the list. 
The crust here is thicker than 
a usual New York slice, though 
still slender with a sweet sauce, 
which is complemented by a 
perfect blend of ricotta and 
mozzarella. 
The 
meatballs 
make the pie a worthwhile 
contestant 
for 
a 
shotgun 
wedding, as it is impossible to 
be anything but in love with the 
specialty pie Denino’s is known 
for.
Despite my defiant opinion 
that New York pizza is a one-of-
a-kind, out of everyone’s league 
slice, there are other places that 
certainly threaten to challenge 
New York’s seat at the top of the 
pizza hierarchy.
One of these places, Sally’s 

Something in the Water: A 
spotlight on NYC pizza

DAILY FOOD COLUMN
Apizza, a New Haven, Conn. 
hole in the wall, definitely puts 
up a good fight. Both Sally’s 
Apizza and its neighbor and 
brother pizzeria Frank Pepe’s 
consistently 
make 
national 
best slice lists. Both have 
large fan bases, and most 
of these fans have a strong 
opinion as to which place 
serves the better ’za. For me, 
it’s Sally’s Apizza, which I’ve 
had the great pleasure of 
eating at twice in my 19 years, 
not counting the leftovers. 
Both Sally’s and Pepe’s serve 
thin, charred crusted pizza, 
and 
their 
differences 
are 
not 
immediately 
apparent. 
However, Pepe’s is known for 
its trademark (and incredible) 
white clam pizza, and Sally’s 
for its signature tomato pie, 
stark in its simplicity, topped 
with nothing but a sprinkle 
of parmesan. Despite Pepe’s 
unique take on ’za, Sally’s 
brings me back to my base, 
reminds me why I eat pizza, 
and gives me the reality check 
only the best things in life 

can. Sally’s is open five days a 
week at 4:00 p.m., and the line 
begins to form about an hour 
beforehand on days of business, 
because the slice is that good.
What makes these slices 
perfect 10s comes down to a few 
things. First, the ingredients, 
all of which are fresh and, for 
lack of a better term, primo. 
Second is the heart and passion 
of the pizzerias; these slices 
are 
handcrafted 
to 
mean 
something 
more 
than 
just 
pizza. They are time machines 
to 
other 
worlds, 
invoking 
memories 
of 
grandmothers 
passed, 
family 
dinners 
on 
Sunday afternoons, heritage 
and a country with an innate 
capacity of bringing people 
together through good food.
What I recommend when 
seeking 
out 
a 
good 
slice 
anywhere, but especially in the 
five boroughs of New York, is 
to ignore appearances, follow 
the crowds, don’t be afraid of a 
shabby exterior or a crumbling 
infrastructure — instead look 
for the heart, the San Marzano 

tomatoes and the hands of the 
pizza chef. Those hands make 
the magic of the perfect slice 
— never underestimate the 
architects of such ecstasy.
Whereas in Chicago you’re 
confined to the deep dish, in 
Detroit, some square looking 
nonsense (sorry) and on the 
West Coast cardboard (sorry 
again), 
the 
diversity 
and 
simplicity of the slice in New 
York City is what makes it the 
pizza capital of the United 
States. The notoriety of the 
New York City slice makes all 
other cities overwhelmed with 
a jealousy so intense that they 
should turn it into motivation 
to get on New York’s level.
After all, I don’t think any 
of us East Coasters here in the 
Midwest would complain if 
someone could figure out the 
key to bringing the New York 
slice a few hundred miles west, 
but then again, confining the 
best pizza in the country to 
the city’s 303.33 square mile 
area is what makes it such an 
idiosyncrasy.

A wise pizza 
lover once told 
me that in order 
to be a perfect 
10, the slice has 
to pass the most 
important pizza 
taste test: You 
must be able 
to taste each 
ingredient

BOOK REVIEW

Akwaeke 
Emezi’s 
debut 
novel 
“Freshwater” 
is 
as 
fascinatingly fractured as its 
protagonist Ada, a woman 
plagued 
with 
a 
form 
of 
dissociative identity disorder. 
Yet 
rather 
than 
taking 
a 
scientific 
approach 
to 
her 
depiction, 
Emezi 
tells 
the 
story almost entirely from 
the perspective of Ada’s other 
selves, self-described “gods” 
that are trapped within her 
body, 
providing 
a 
primal 
plunge into the chaos of a 
mind that isn’t entirely whole. 
Her ailment is painted from 
the inside out, employing the 
supernatural to make sense of 
this condition. In one of the 
few chapters from her own 
perspective, Ada describes the 
tone of the novel best: “The 
world in my head has been far 
more real than the one outside 
— maybe that’s the exact 
definition of madness, come to 
think of it.”
The novel certainly isn’t 
for everyone. As a strong 
debut, it showcases Emezi’s 
ability to write from multiple 
perspectives, shifting tone and 
atmosphere on the fly to build 
a strong cast of characters that 
do not even exist within the 
tangible world of the novel. 
However, Emezi also drop-
kicks the reader into a world 

ruled by these supernatural 
figures who have little concern 
for 
humanity’s 
well-being, 
requiring a great deal of trust 
from the reader that the novel 
will eventually unfold its logic 
— which it does, to an extent.
As the novel’s focal point on 
mental illness would suggest, 
it’s 
a 
bleak 
exploration 
of 
human 
thought 
and interaction. 
Emezi does not 
shy away from 
carnal 
desire, 
self-harm 
and 
human 
cruelty. 
Ada’s 
most 
prominent 
and 
powerful identity, Asughara 
(which translates as the Igbo 
word for “dagger”), is born 
from 
Ada’s 
sexual 
assault. 
Asughara presents Ada’s most 
malicious self, toying with 
sex and emotion for her own 
amusement. She initially has 
little concern for her “flesh 
prison” and often tries to plan 
Ada’s death to make an escape, 
but she justifies her evil as 
protection for Ada’s fragility in 
the world, often taking over to 
protect her from sex.
Most impressive about the 
novel is the way that Emezi 
slowly immerses the reader 
in the emotions of these gods, 
humanizing them throughout 
the course of the novel. Ada 
herself is by far one of the 
more minor characters in the 

novel, which focuses mainly on 
Asughara and a pair of even-
toned spirits only known as 
“We.” As Asughara’s malice 
devolves into fierce protection 
over Ada, we get a sense of the 
way we justify our own deep 
desires 
to 
ourselves. 
Saint 
Vincent, Ada’s weaker identity, 
depicts 
human 
curiosity 
and 
symbolizes Ada’s 
exploration 
into 
sexual fluidity but 
from a perspective 
of 
innocence 
rather 
than 
impulse as shown 
in 
Asughara. 
As fractured as 
Ada’s psyche is, Emezi makes 
it 
startlingly 
easy 
to 
see 
ourselves in her.
“Freshwater” is undoubtedly 
an impressive debut. Emezi 
has 
incredible 
talent 
for 
storytelling that eases the 
reader into the rhythm of 
her prose, and her ability 
to shift and blend different 
perspectives within the same 
mind is as beautiful as it is 
ultimately frightening. Many 
may find the novel to be 
too bleak and otherworldly 
to be worth the read, but 
“Freshwater” 
rewards 

those with patience to see it 
through to the end. While the 
novel is thoroughly dark and 
demanding, it doesn’t forgo 
a sense of resolution and 
reparation.

‘Freshwater’ is a primal 
dive into mental illness

Jeff Mills is a name that 
carries significance, at least 
within the realm of modern 
American 
techno. 
One 
of 
the 
founding 
members 
of 
Underground Resistance — a 
Detroit-based label combining 
Motown soul and gritty electro-
techno with DIY charm and 
an almost militaristic edge not 
unlike Public Enemy — Mills 
helped construct the Detroit 
techno scene in the late ’80s and 
early ’90s before moving to New 
York to further pursue a solo 
career. He is deserving of his 
title; his DJ sets are complex, 
often stacked with three or four 
turntables, and he pioneers new 
directions to take the electronic 
music he produces, often adding 
keyboard, drum and orchestral 
input to his sets.
Yet, despite Mills’s well-
established 
history 
within 
American techno and obvious 
prowess, he finds more success 
internationally than he does 
within 
his 
hometown 
of 
Detroit, noticing that European 

countries are more welcoming 
of his nouveau interpretations 
of techno: Fusing electronic and 
classical to create a sound that 
is almost celestial. “I’ve been 
doing this for about a decade 
and have never once received 
an invitation to come to the US, 
so I have to assume there isn’t 
much interest,” Mills revealed 
in a 2015 interview with The 
Guardian.
Which is why his live show 
with afrobeat drummer Tony 
Allen at Marble Bar on Mar. 2 
was so unprecedented. Not only 
did two musical legends have 
the opportunity to perform 
together — with Rolling Stone 
naming Tony Allen as one of top 
100 greatest drummers of all 
time — but also it was a chance 
to see Mills return to his roots, 
on-stage in the same city where 
his career all started.
Before 
the 
group 
even 
appeared, 
the 
energy 
was 
tangible. The sold-out show 
caused the venue to become 
packed with people; the wall-
to-wall 
anticipation 
made 
the air spark, and when the 
musicians finally stepped into 
view — sophistication conveyed 
through sleek, suave suits and 

tinted sunglasses — the crowd 
seemed to burst into flames.
The show was immersive; 
the combination of neon tinted 
stage lights, live drum set and 
video projection allowing the 
audience to fully view the scope 
of the complexities behind a 
Jeff Mills DJ set caused the 
performance to feel personal, 
the stripped-down synth and 
ever-evolving percussion felt 
larger than life. Everything 
seemed organic. Rather than 
a 
rehearsed 
performance, 
Marble Bar hosted a dynamic 
conversation 
between 
the 
various instruments on stage: 
The tempo would change, and 
the kick drum would respond 
accordingly. Muted keyboard 
would smoothly progress into 
more upbeat rhythms as the 
drumline kicked in. Consistent 
over everything, Jeff Mills kept 
the pulse alive, fingers flying 
over the turntables in front of 
him, face calmly focused on the 
task at hand. Nothing seemed 
planned, yet every snare, every 
cymbal 
crash, 
every 
sound 
modulation coming from Mills 
was done with purpose and 
precision — mastery over an art 
form at its finest.

TRAILER REVIEW: ‘READY PLAYER ONE’

 Ernest Cline’s bestselling 
science fiction novel, “Ready 
Player One,” has been given 
the Spielberg treatment for the 
film adaptation’s Mar. release. 
In the year 2045, the Earth has 
become a trash heap of a plan-
et thanks to overpopulation 
and climate change. Therefore, 
the people of the world have 
turned to a virtual alternative 
much better than the real one. 
They live most of their lives in 
this virtual universe called the 
OASIS, which provides every-
thing from socialization to 
entertainment to jobs. When 
the OASIS founder, James 
Halliday (Mark Rylance, “The 
B.F.G.”), dies, he decides to 
give his fortune away in a 
Wonka-like fashion by hid-
ing an Easter egg within the 
OASIS. The 
one who finds 
it will inherit 
his wealth. 
Halliday, 
obsessed with 
the culture of 
his ’80s youth, 
drops reference 
upon reference to his favorite 
bygone era in his universe. 
Enter Wade Watts (Tye Sheri-
dan, “Mud”), an OASIS fiend 
from my hometown of Colum-
bus, Ohio who hopes to win 
the prize through his exten-
sive knowledge of ’80s culture 

and skilled gaming techniques. 
Wade, alongside a rag-tag team 
of fellow gamers including the 
likes of Lena Waithe (“Master 
of None”) and Olivia Cooke 
(“Me, Earl and the Dying 
Girl”), face off 
against a group 
corporate-backed 
gamers after Hal-
liday’s fortune.
 The trailer 
gives off “Tron” 
and “Bladerun-
ner 2049” vibes, 
trying to capture the neon-lit 
grittiness of a futuristic dysto-
pia. Scattered throughout are 
several references to the nos-
talgia that Cline relies so heav-
ily on in his novel; everything 
from “The Iron Giant” to the 
DeLorean from “Back to the 

Future” make an appearance 
in the trailer. It looks as if the 
film may be trying too hard 
to be a gamer movie. While 
the book is rooted in gaming 
culture, hopefully the film will 
capture the more cinematic 
aspects of the story.
 “Ready Player One” runs 
the risk of getting lost in 
Cline’s cultural references, 
making it more of an ode to 
John Hughes than a Spielberg 
original. Will Spielberg deliver 
an “Apocalypse Now” or is 
“Ready Player One” destined 
for Atari-level failure? The 
film adaptation may be a hit, 
but I have a feeling it’s headed 
for Game Over.

Indoor season ends in bittersweet fashion

For the Michigan women’s 

track and field team, spring break 
didn’t begin with tanning on a 
beach or backpacking through 
America’s 
greatest 
parks. 

Instead, it was spent competing 
in the Big Ten Indoor Track and 
Field Championship.

While there may be no wonders 

of the world in Geneva, Ohio — 
the site of the championships — 
there is an indoor track facility 
where the Wolverines closed out 
their Big Ten indoor season to 
bittersweet results.

For 
a 
few 
athletes, 
the 

weekend’s tournament proved 
favorable. 
Two 
Wolverines 

claimed Big Ten titles, a relay 
team set a school record and five 
athletes advanced to the NCAA 
Championship.

Fifth-year senior Haley Meier 

won the mile with a 4:46.05 and 
punched her ticket to the NCAA 
Indoor Championship. The race 
came down to a near-photo finish 
where Meier narrowly escaped 

last year’s champion, Madeline 
Strandemo of Minnesota, edging 
her out by less than three-
quarters of a second.

“This has been a goal for a 

really long time, and one that 
I’ve wanted to have since I got 
to Michigan,” Meier said. “It was 
really an amazing experience. 
A lot of blood, sweat and tears 
went into trying to get there, but 
I really just owe a lot of that to 
my coach and especially to Claire 
(Borchers) and my sister Hannah 
who also competed with me to 
get me there.”

Having 
never 
been 
to 
a 

national meet to compete as an 
individual, the competition next 
weekend will surely be a new 
experience.

“I’ve been struggling with 

my mentality before races for 
a long time,” Meier said. “It’s 
really taken some time to figure 
out what works for me before 
races and no matter what, there’s 
always going to be nerves, but 
it’s always so important to let 
yourself be excited too.”

Senior Claire Kieffer-Wright 

captured gold in the high jump 
after a tie-breaking finish and 
will be joining Meier in College 
Station for the championship.

“It 
was 
really 
exciting,” 

Kieffer-Wright said. “I want to, of 
course, thank my teammates for 
cheering me on in the sidelines 
and all my coaches and trainers 
and my mom for being there for 
me.”

Kieffer-Wright 
separated 

herself from the pack by clearing 
1.81 meters on her first attempt, 
paving the way for her top-place 
finish.

But though Michigan earned 

several individual accolades, the 
team struggled as a whole.

The 
Wolverines 
finished 

eighth 
of 
13 
teams 
despite 

the 
individual 
performances, 

showing that Michigan still has 
a lot to improve on going into the 
outdoor season.

“I thought on one hand our 

bread and butter was middle-
distance and distance,” said 
Michigan coach James Henry. 
“They had an outstanding day, 
an 
outstanding 
performance 

and I thought the area that I was 
responsible for didn’t bring it the 
way that I thought that they were 
going to bring it until the end 
with the (4x400-meter) relay.”

Henry, who primarily coaches 

the sprinters, watched his group 
struggle all weekend, reaching 
the podium in only one event. 
The 4x400-meter relay team 
set a school record of 3:37.88 but 
finished just fifth in a deep field 
of runners.

“Everyone’s got to take some 

responsibility,” 
Henry 
said. 

“There were some kids that didn’t 
get out there and execute or I 
didn’t prepare them accordingly. 
It’s probably a combination of 
both, so taking responsibility 
as a coach and an athlete is the 
biggest step towards solving our 
mediocre performance.”

Added Kieffer-Wright: “It was 

good to see that some people are 
stepping up. I think that if those 
people who are stepping up can 
bring one or two people along 
with them to the outdoor season, 
I think that will really help our 
team standings.”

Michigan hires Klein

After 10 years, the Michigan 

women’s soccer team is starting 
anew.

Athletic 
director 
Warde 

Manuel announced Feb. 28 that 
Jennifer Klein will take over 
as head coach of the program, 
replacing Greg Ryan. 

Klein, 33, comes to Ann Arbor 

with a considerable amount of 
coaching experience at every 
level. She first began as the head 
coach at Nevada-Las Vegas, then 
moved on to become an assistant 
coach at Washington State and 
Southern California, where she 
spent that past few years.

“Michigan has such great 

academic and athletic traditions 
and I can’t wait to be a part of 
it,” Klein said in a statement 
on MGoBlue.com. “I am really 
looking forward to coaching 
and leading the women’s soccer 
program as we work to pursue 
excellence both on and off the 
field.”

Klein was the youngest head 

coach in Division I women’s 
soccer when she was named the 
head coach of Nevada-Las Vegas’ 
program in 2010. In her first year, 
the Runnin’ Rebels saw their win 
total increase from five wins to 
11, and set a school record with 
38 goals.

During her four years as an 

assistant coach at Southern 

California, the Trojans amassed 
a 71-19-9 record and won the 
NCAA Tournament in 2016.

Conversely, the Wolverines 

finished last season 3-5-3 in Big 
Ten play (6-6-6 overall), and 
haven’t notched a win in the 
NCAA Tournament since 2013. 
Michigan didn’t reach the NCAA 
Tournament 
in 
either 
Ryan 

or original head coach Debbie 
Rademacher’s first three seasons.

With Klein’s hiring and her 

recruiting prowess, though, the 
Wolverines will look to buck 
trend. As the assistant head 
coach at USC for the last three 
seasons, Klein was in charge of 
recruiting for the Trojans. She 
should provide a boost in that 
department for a program that 
has struggled to attract a lot of 
top-end talent. While she was an 
assistant coach at Washington 
State, Klein also helped recruit 
2014 Pac-12 Player of the Year 
Micahela Castain.

Klein 
also 
holds 
playing 

experience under her belt, and 
has been battle-tested in big 
games. From 2002 to 2005, Klein 
played for Arizona, and was a 
captain in her final two years. In 
2004, the Wildcats captured a 
Pac-10 Championship and made 
it to the third round of the NCAA 
Tournament the following year.

Between 
that 
and 
her 

recruting skills, better times 
could be on the horizon for the 
program.

Weak finish, but still strong enough

Ambiguity isn’t fun. Let’s get 

rid of it right away. The Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team deserves 
to be in.

The 

Wolverines 
(10-6 Big Ten, 
22-9 overall) 
should 
hear 

their 
name 

called by the 
selection 
committee 
next Monday. They should — for 
the first time in five years — play 
an NCAA Tournament game.

Michigan’s February was one 

to forget. The Wolverines blew 
a 16-point lead in the last seven 
minutes of their game against 
Purdue on the first day of the 
month, then proceeded to drop 
three of the next four, falling to 
sixth in the Big Ten.

On top of everything, freshman 

forward Hailey Brown suffered a 
leg injury — Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico estimated she’ll be 

out for the season. What had been 
a team likely to host early-round 
games became one that needed 
another couple wins to avoid 
disaster.

And that’s exactly what it got.
Facing a must-win scenario 

on Senior Night, the Wolverines 
knocked off then-No. 13 Maryland 
on the back of 17 points from 
sophomore 
forward 
Akienreh 

Johnson. Barnes Arico exercised 
caution postgame, but it was clear 
the mood had shifted — and with 
good reason.

Michigan’s resume over the 

season’s first three months is 
unimpeachable. The Wolverines 
didn’t lose to a team outside the 
top 25 and beat Ohio State — now 
sixth in RPI — in Columbus. Their 
losses being condensed into four 
weeks instead of spread out over 
four months shouldn’t matter for 
anything but seeding.

At the Big Ten Tournament, 

Michigan did what it had to do, 
beating Penn State to a pulp in 
Thursday’s first round before 
falling to Nebraska in the second. 

It was all the Wolverines needed.

“We had finished third in 

the league (last year) and had 
a decent RPI, a top-50 RPI, but 
(the selection committee) said we 
didn’t have enough top-50 wins,” 
Barnes Arico said Friday. “This 
year, we have a bunch of top-25 
wins. We have three top 25 wins 
and we have a 38 RPI (ranking). 
Our conference is significantly 
better. Our double opponents 
were pretty good.

“So we think we’ve done what 

we needed to do.”

It’s around this point in 

the calendar that every coach 
becomes 
a 
salesperson, 
but 

Barnes Arico’s pitch is worth 
buying.

If it can replicate its peak, 

Michigan is capable of stringing a 
run. Senior point guard Katelynn 
Flaherty can light up anybody 
from outside and junior Nicole 
Munger is shooting 42 percent 
on 3-pointers as the starting ‘2’. 
Johnson has taken Brown’s spot 
in the rotation and filled it in full, 
knocking down 60 percent from 

the field in the four games since 
Brown’s injury. Junior center 
Hallie Thome is as much a low-
post threat as any other center in 
the conference.

Even so, making it past the first 

weekend is far from a guarantee. 
If anything, it’s unlikely. The 
Cornhuskers 
shut 
down 
the 

Wolverines’ offense on Friday 
and, though Flaherty has gotten 
better against constant face-
guarding, turnovers are still an 
issue. Going 2-4 in February also 
opened the door to a matchup with 
No. 1 Connecticut as soon as the 
second round of the Tournament 
— a scenario currently projected 
in ESPN’s Bracketology.

If Michigan gets in, it will 

have crawled in. The Wolverines 
were capable of doing more than 
finishing sixth in the Big Ten 
and that’s worth noting. Their 
resume isn’t perfect. It may not be 
deserving of anything more than 
a No. 8 seed and a second round 
date with the Huskies.

But they’ve done enough to get 

in.

The Michigan women’s basketball team should make the NCAA Tournament based on its strong performance from all but the final weeks of the season.

‘M’ soars to second 
at conference meet 

Over a span of four days, 

the No. 7 Michigan men’s 
swimming and diving team put 
teamwork first and took second 
in the Big Ten Championships 
with 1,617.5 points at the 
Minnesota’s Jean K. Freeman 
Aquatic Center. Forty-seven 
personal records were set. 
Of the 26 student-athletes 
representing the Wolverines, 
25 scored points for the team. 
Eleven swimmers received All-
Big Ten honors.

“We had a really great 

meet,” said Michigan coach 
Mike Bottom, “They fought for 
each other, and they have a lot 
of fun. They supported each 
other.” 

Added 
sophomore 
Felix 

Auböck: “What we can be proud 
of is the team performance that 
we had. We kept it close until 
the end.”

The 
Wolverines 
earned 

four Big Ten titles — three 
individual 
and 
one 
relay. 

Auböck won both the 500-
yard freestyle and the 1,650-
yard freestyle; Auböck won 
the 1,650-yard freestyle at last 
year’s Big Ten Championships, 
too. 
Sophomore 
Charlie 

Swanson won the 400-yard 
individual medley. The 200-
yard freestyle relay team of 
freshman Luiz Gustavo Borges, 
graduate student James Peek, 
senior Paul Powers and senior 
Evan White also won.

Powers took third in the 

100-yard freestyle with a time 
of 42.34 — the second-fastest 
time in Michigan’s history.

Peek, who finished eighth in 

the 100-yard freestyle, was a 
Big Ten Sportsmanship Award 
Honoree.

Sophomores Jeremy Babinet, 

Tommy Cope, Jacob Montague 
and 
Charlie 
Swanson 
all 

qualified for the finals in 
the 
200-yard 
breaststroke. 

Montague finished in fourth, 

Swanson in fifth, Cope in sixth 
and Babinet in seventh. Cope 
swam faster in the event’s 
preliminary, with a time of 
1:52.91, the second-fastest time 
in the Wolverines’ history.

Freshman Ross Todd was 

the first Michigan diver to 
qualify for the final in platform 
in four years. His qualification 
in the platform finals made the 
meet that much closer, overall. 
Todd qualified for the finals 
with a score of 76.50 points – 
taking the last qualifying spot. 
Todd finished in fifth with a 
score of 452.75 points, a full 88 
points higher than his personal 
best prior to coming into the 
meet.

“The 
performance 
was 

greater than expected,” said 
Bottom.

Freshman Chris Canning 

and 
sophomore 
Jake 

Herremans 
also 
performed 

well. 
Together, 
the 
three 

divers, Canning, Herremans 
and Todd, scored 98 points.

Freshman Ricardo Vargas 

also performed well at the meet, 
earning two silver medals and 
a bronze. In addition to being 
the highest-scoring freshman 
at the meet, he was also named 
Big Ten Freshman of the Year.

“That was pretty exciting for 

us,” Bottom said.

Saying that it was for ‘us’ 

— as opposed to ‘him’ — the 
Sportsmanship 
Award 
that 

Peek won and the overall 
success from the different 
facets of the team encapsulate 
the 
spirit 
of 
comradery 

Michigan emulated throughout 
the four-day meet.

The 
Wolverines 
surely 

wanted to finish first in the Big 
Ten, their teamwork seemed 
second-to-none. That’s nothing 
to scoff at.

“I don’t think there was 

even one race where I saw 
someone giving up,” Auböck 
said. “Everyone was swimming 
for another person on the team 
and for each other.”

Two best friends experience the Big Ten Tournament

NEW YORK CITY, NY. — 

The Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s locker room was rattling 
after it dismantled Nebraska, 
77-58, to reach the semifinals of 
the Big Ten Tournament. The 
Wolverines’ Jan. 18 defeat in 
Lincoln was an afterthought. A 
date with then-No. 2 Michigan 
State loomed.

Reporters shuffled into the 

tight guest locker room, elbows 
were bumped and recorders were 
stuffed in the student-athletes’ 
faces. 
Scrums 
accumulated 

around 
usual 
suspects 
— 

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman and Moritz Wagner. 
Finding a player without a smile 
was hard.

Except for Jordan Poole. The 

freshman guard furrowed his 
brows and asked antsy journalists 
to wait a second before he would 
answer questions. He scoured 
the room, shouting.

“Where my best friend at? 

Where my best friend at?”

Poole’s missing best friend 

was fellow freshman Isaiah 
Livers. The 6-foot-7 forward 
simply hadn’t reached the locker 
room yet as he traipsed slowly 
off the court and past the team 
showers, but best friends don’t 
leave each other behind. Once 
Livers had entered the room, the 
two embraced and sat down in 
their typical spots — side by side 
lockers — and faced the media.

“He’s a big drama guy,” Livers 

said of Poole.

Drama, as they would soon 

discover, was fitting for the 
occasion. The two freshmen 
and the rest of Michigan would 
theatrically display impeccable 
chemistry in their next two 
contests en route to a Big Ten 
Tournament Championship.

Their season isn’t over yet, 

but Poole and Livers can already 
check off one of their goals on 
their college bucket list.

“It feels amazing,” Poole said 

after 
beating 

Purdue 
in 
the 

finals. 
“Being 

able to go out in 
a situation like 
this 
and 
beat 

(Michigan State 
and 
Purdue) 

and 
Nebraska 

and 
Iowa, 
it’s 

just 
amazing. 

Being 
able 
to 

experience 
something like this at such a 
historic arena puts the cherry on 
top.”

Playing 
high-stakes 
games 

at Madison Square Garden is 
usually enough to give any first-
year player pause. But for a guy 

as boisterous as Poole, that isn’t 
necessarily true. He had played 
at the Garden when he was in 
high school at La Lumiere, one 

of the nation’s 
premier 
high 

school programs.

For Livers, on 

the other hand, 
the bright lights 
and 
spacious 

arena 
were 
a 

shock 
to 
the 

system. 
The 

Kalamazoo, 
Mich. 
native 

described 
his 

high school days as spent in a 
“little, tiny gym” absent of the 
grandiose pageantry. It was 
big enough to contend and win 
Michigan Mr. Basketball, but not 
enough to walk into the World’s 
Most Famous Arena without 

awe. Like Poole, though, Livers 
found comfort in it.

“I like the atmosphere at 

Madison Square Garden,” Livers 
said. “I felt it right during shoot 
around. I was like ‘Dang, this 
is pretty big.’ That just kinda 
pushed me to play better.”

Poole 
and 
Livers 
weren’t 

significant contributors in the 
tournament — they combined 
to post just 6.8 points and 4.6 
boards each contest. Though it 
was a lackluster weekend for the 
two, they still had an opportunity 
to marvel at the big stage.

The pair took time to admire 

the history of MSG when they 
first arrived. When they settled 
into the New York Knicks’ 
locker room on Thursday to 
play Iowa — the only time the 
team suited up there during the 
tournament — they gazed at the 

wooden lockers. They saw the 
names of two former Michigan 
greats embellished on them, and 
harbored an inclination to be 
like them in the 
future.

“You got Tim 

Hardaway 
Jr. 

over there, you 
got Trey Burke,” 
Livers 
said, 

pointing out their 
lockers. “They’re 
doing what we 
wanna do in a 
couple years. It 
just motivates me 
to go out there and play hard.”

Added Poole: “We see guys 

who were in the same situation 
that we were. They just kept 
working, kept fighting and they 
were able to accomplish their 
dreams. At the end of the day, 

that’s what you play basketball 
for. … We find it motivating.”

Another 
Michigan 
great, 

2017 
graduate 
and 
current 

G-League player Zak Irvin, has 
been keeping tabs on Poole and 
Livers. And when Irvin, who 
attended the matchup against 
the Hawkeyes, embraced the 
two freshmen in the locker room 
afterwards, they conversed like 
they were longtime teammates.

“The guys before me did the 

same thing to when I came in 
even though I didn’t get to play 
with them,” Irvin said of his 
relationship with the freshmen. 
“They still took me under their 
arms. It’s the same thing I’m 
doing with them. They’re a 
talented group. They’ll be leading 
Michigan here in the future.”

Between the commotion of 

games in Madison Square Garden 
and the noise from teammates 
and former players coming in, 
basketball engulfed the social 
lives of Poole and Livers. The 
team took a brief walk around 
Times Square before their first 
game, but didn’t do much else 
besides mimicking plays in their 
hotel’s ballroom and lounging in 
their rooms.

It really was 

a business trip 
for 
the 
wide-

eyed 
freshmen. 

And even if they 
didn’t cause too 
much of a stir, 
they still deemed 
their experience 
unimaginable.

With the two 

best 
friends 

drenched 
in 

water, egging on a dancing John 
Beilein as they celebrated the Big 
Ten Tournament Championship, 
they looked ready to conquer the 
next big stage in March Madness. 
It was clear that business was 
booming.

Freshmen Isaiah Livers and Jordan Poole are inseparable roommates who just experienced their first Big Ten Tournament together in New York City.

“They’ll 
be leading 

Michigan here 
in the future.”

Lavigne shows off mental resiliency in sweep

Hayden Lavigne had a rocky 

start Friday.

The sophomore goaltender — 

who has championed the No. 11 
Michigan hockey team’s defense 
in the second half of the season 
as a stalwart brick wall in front 
of the net — wasn’t playing to his 
potential.

While the Wolverines (11-10-

3 Big Ten, 20-13-3 overall) got 
out to a one-goal lead, Wisconsin 
defenseman 
Tyler 
Inamoto 

started an onslaught that would 
see three total Badger goals in the 
first period.

Though Michigan would go on 

to steal a 6-5 victory and later a 
weekend sweep over Wisconsin 
(8-13-2-1, 14-19-3), that wasn’t 
evident at the 15-minute mark 
when arguably the Wolverines’ 
greatest 
defensive 
asset 
was 

left looking up into the air in 
frustration.

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

even mentioned after the game 
Friday that he considered pulling 

Lavigne after he allowed a third 
goal in the first period.

And with the game’s momentum 

arguably on the line at this point, 
Pearson called a timeout to 
reassure his players and his star 
goaltender.

“We just talked about … (How) 

we hadn’t played yet, we hadn’t 
played,” Pearson said Friday. “We 
were just out there spectators, they 
should’ve charged us for admission 
tonight to come into the building 
the way the first 10 minutes went.

“Then we started to play. And 

it wasn’t everybody, but you know, 
a lot of guys haven’t been through 
this, we’re still a young team. … 
We were very loose, and we need 
everybody.”

He squashed the temptation 

of ending Lavigne’s night, and 
what happened next proved that 
Lavigne 
could 
withstand 
the 

pressures of postseason hockey.

“Hayden, I think the guy gave 

up five goals that maybe he had a 
tough night,” Pearson said, “but 
other than the one, I thought he 
played excellent tonight.”

Senior forward Tony Calderone 

— who scored the Wolverines’ first 
tally — started a four-goal scoring 
streak that Wisconsin would not 
ultimately recover from.

“He knows how to handle 

himself in good and bad times,” 
Calderone said. “He struggled 
in the beginning of the year but 
pulled himself out 
of it. So, I think 
he’s one of those 
guys that you’ve 
got to let him go 
and let him do 
his thing because 
you 
know 
he’s 

gonna do the right 
thing.”

And doing the 

right thing in this 
case was a career-
high 48 saves that proved to be just 
enough to hold Michigan’s one-
goal lead — good for the opening 
night victory.

While five goals allowed doesn’t 

look too pretty on the box score, 
Lavigne gave a veteran comeback 
performance where significant 
early struggles seemed miniscule 
in the end.

“I don’t think it was Hayden’s 

fault, I think we made a bunch of 
mental mistakes,” Calderone said. 
“Hayden’s been great for us all year 
and I think he played great tonight. 
I think it was a lot of mental 
breakdowns by us that caused that. 
So, no, I don’t think he needed any 

picking up. I think 
he’s pretty solid 
mentally.”

Lavigne 

continued 
his 
steadfast 

performance 
with 28 saves in 
the 
quarterfinal 

round 
against 

the Badgers with 
28 saves, though 
his prowess was 

an afterthought due to another 
round of high-output play from the 
Wolverine front line.

Lavigne’s comeback in the 

second and third periods Friday 
shows that Michigan holds a 
mentally durable backline able to 
withstand the demands of what, 
from now on, will be postseason 
single-elimination hockey.

Slow start dooms Michigan 
to sixth at Big Ten Indoors

The 
Big 
Ten 
Indoor 

Championships were in full 
throttle last weekend as the 
Michigan men’s track and field 
team finished sixth with 57 
points.

In the shot put, junior Andrew 

Liskowitz and senior Grant 
Cartwright finished fourth and 
fifth, respectively, to contribute 
nine points toward the team 
score.

The relay team, consisting of 

senior Ryan Wilkie, sophomore 
Desmond Melson, junior Matt 
Plowman 
and 
sophomore 

Andrew Lorant also added extra 
points after taking sixth place in 
the distance medley event.

“I thought we had a good day 

(on Saturday),” said Michigan 
coach Jerry Clayton. “We had 
a little bit of a rough start the 
first day. We were hoping to get 
a few more people qualified to 
the finals, but it is what it is. The 
people that we did get through, 
I thought they lined well in that 
final day which helped us finish 
as high as we could.”

The 
second 
day 
of 
the 

tournament featured a historic 
performance from the weight 
throwers. Junior Joe Ellis, in 
particular, was 
the team’s star at 
Saturday’s meet. 
Ellis broke the 
program weight 
throw 
record 

with a distance 
of 23.31 meters 
— 
breaking 

Cartwright’s 
record 
last 

season. 
Ellis 

continued 
his 
record-

breaking performance with a 
championship winning throw 
of 23.64 meters. Ellis’ record 
is 
currently 
ranked 
second 

nationally and 13th in collegiate 
history.

“It’s the first big step towards 

becoming a legendary year,” 
Ellis said. “It certainly feels 
good. Setting a personal record 
at the Big Ten Championships is 
definitely a big deal.”

Cartwright also earned a spot 

on the podium by placing third 
with a season-best toss of 22.87 
meters, losing to Penn State’s 
David Lucas.

“Penn State’s got a great team 

over there,” Ellis said. “We 
are all really close and close 
competitors. 
Me 
and 
Grant 

(Cartwright) 
were 
fighting 

against David Lucas and Morgan 
Shigo. We got more points at the 
end so job well done.”

Ellis 
and 
Cartwright’s 

combined throws totaled 46.51 
meters. Their record went down 
in the books as the farthest 
combined throw by a pair of 
teammates 
in 
a 
non-NCAA 

Championship 
meet. 
Their 

total score also finished as one 
of the best duo added totals in 
collegiate history.

Clayton 
believes 
the 

Wolverines 
should 
rank 
in 

the top 20 nationally, and is 
relying 
on 
certain 
athletes 

to get the team to the NCAA 
Championships. 
Ellis 
and 

Cartwright 
are 
guaranteed 

spots in the weight throw, while 
Liskowitz is waiting on other 

national results 
to 
see 
if 
he 

qualifies in the 
shot put. Senior 
distance runner 
Ben Flanagan is 
also hoping to 
qualify in the 
5000-meter.

“It’s 

attainable 
if 

we get all four 
of them in the 
meet,” 
Clayton 

said. “We’ve come relatively 
close to that. We always want 
people challenging for the top 
three and for the championship. 
That’s a direction that we need to 
keep working hard and moving 
towards in this outdoor season.”
