College Dems host 
forum to encourage 

participation in 
Tuesday’s election

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

In a push to increase student 

voter turnout before city-wide 
elections Tuesday, Ann Arbor 

City Council members part-
nered with the University’s 
Chapter of College Democrats to 
host an event emphasizing the 
importance of civic participa-
tion Thursday.

Held in the Michigan Union, 

the event coincided with Col-
lege Democrats’ Get Out The 
Vote campaign, an initiative that 
seeks to increase votership in 
the final days leading up to elec-
tions.

Council members and mem-

bers of the College Democrats 
sought to inform students about 
candidates in advance of the 
upcoming elections as well as 
provide a platform for some 
council members to introduce 
potential plans for University 
and the city of Ann Arbor.

Public Policy senior Erin 

Bozek-Jarvis told attendees that 
when more people vote overall, 
it’s generally positive for Demo-
crats.

“The reason why (Get Out 

The Vote) is so important, espe-
cially for Democrats, is because 
it’s our time to shine,” she said. 
“When voter turnout is high, 
Democrats win. That’s a proven 
fact. The good thing about being 
a Democrat is we have grass-
roots people power and (get out 
the vote) is where that shows the 
best.”

Lighting Lead for 
classic animated 
films discusses 
career at Angell

By JACOB RICH

Daily Film Editor

Pixar. Need I say more? You 

know their movies, and you love 
them. It seems current college 
students in particular have a deep 
affinity for these films, being the 
first generation to have grown up 
with their now-classics such as 
“Toy Story,” “Finding Nemo” and 
“The Incredibles.” 

 But how does Pixar create 

their art? Who are the men and 
women that make the visual 
beauty of these computer-ani-
mated films possible? 

 Last week, I crammed myself 

into a packed Angell Hall audi-
torium along with dozens of 
other University students to 
meet a Pixar wizard in the flesh: 
Jonathan Pytko. His presenta-
tion gave insight into his career 
in digital lighting, as well as a 
look at Pixar’s production pro-
cess. He also gave us a preview 
of “The Good Dinosaur,” their 
latest project.

 A veteran Lighting Lead, 

Pytko joined the Emeryville, 

CA-based company to work 
on 2004’s “The Incredibles” (a 
hushed wave of excitement and 
“oh my god I love that movie so 
much” whispers rushed over the 
crowd when he listed that bul-
let point on his resume) and has 
since lit films like “Ratatouille,” 
“Up” and “Brave.” 

 “I really like to make things 

with my hands. I like to build 
models and paint and draw, play 
with Legos, and all that stuff,” 
he said in a post-presentation 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily. “All that stuff is great, but 
you never have that piece, the 
piece that you’re missing, or you 
don’t have the color for the paint-
ing you’re trying to do. When I 
was in high school, I got my first 
computer and I started playing 
around with (computer anima-
tion). And you have all the colors, 
and whatever’s in your head. If 
you can get it in there, you can get 
it out on the computer, so it’s kind 
of this limitless opportunity.” 

 Pytko began his presentation 

by showing us a few proof-of-
concept shots that his team 
worked on in pre-production of 
“The Good Dinosaur.” They were 
drop-dead 
gorgeous 
moving 

images of natural scenes: a leafy 
twig with beaded water droplets 
and a river flowing through a 
mountainous landscape.

questions on R&E

Over ice cream sundaes, 

LSA Dean Andrew Martin held 
an open forum as part of a con-
tinuing series of #withDean-
Martin talks.

Approximately 
20 
stu-

dents gathered in the Michi-
gan Union’s Pond Room on 

Thursday night to ask Martin 
questions about various top-
ics, including the University’s 
forthcoming diversity plan and 
course evaluations.

During the talk, Martin 

emphasized his support for 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s new diversity plan 
that is moving forward this 
year. Schlissel is currently 
soliciting input from the Uni-
versity’s various units and 
departments to inform a larg-
er strategic plan to improve 
diversity and inclusion at the 
University.

“It’s an incredibly important 

process for the University, and 

I think it’s going to provide 
us a really nice plan for what 
we are going to be doing as an 
institution 
going 
forward,” 

Martin said. “It’s really some-
thing that this campus holds as 
a core value.”

Martin 
said 
different 

departments within LSA are 
working on specific initiatives 
that could eventually coordi-
nate into a campus-wide stra-
tegic plan down the road.

“All the schools and colleges 

are going through a coordinat-
ed strategic planning process 
this academic year, and at the 
very end this is all going to roll 

Wolverines, Golden 

Gophers set for 

emotional matchup 

in Minneapolis

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

After two long weeks spent 

trying to process a shocking loss 
to Michigan State on Oct. 17, 
the Michigan football team will 
finally return to the playing field 
Saturday.

The Wolverines travel to Min-

nesota to take on the Golden 
Gophers in a game that will be 
influenced in large part by emo-
tion.

For Minnesota, Saturday will 

be an opportunity to win for Jerry 
Kill, the former Golden Gophers 
coach who retired Wednesday 
due to health concerns. Kill suf-
fered two seizures on Tuesday, 
leaving him little choice but to 
address his epilepsy head-on and 
step away from coaching.

A year after Kill’s squad 

brought home the Little Brown 
Jug, his team will have to defend 
the trophy without its leader. But 
as far as Minnesota’s game plan 
goes, Michigan isn’t expecting 
anything different from interim 

Discussion 

considers culturally 
appropriative dress 

on Halloween

By GRIFFIN ST. ONGE

For the Daily

Two days before Halloween, 

students gathered to discuss the 
complex, 
intersectional 
issue 

of Halloween costume cultural 
appropriation and the different 
scenarios in which it can occur.

The open dialogue, titled “It’s 

Just a Costume, Right?” was 
scheduled to be timely and infor-
mative, and aimed to give people 
the tools they need to discuss 
the issue. The event was hosted 
by CommonGround and the IGR 
Student Engagement Team.

LSA senior Elena Ross, a mem-

ber of the Student Engagement 
Team, was one of the students 
responsible for organizing the 
night’s discussion and originally 
suggested its main topic.

“It’s an issue I see come up 

every year and that people don’t 
really know how to handle,” Ross 
said in an interview after the 
event. “We also tried to highlight 
bystander intervention in this 
dialogue for that reason.”

“We came away with some 

actual, tangible tools to use when 
… we’re seeing people dressed up 
in costumes that we find offen-
sive,” she added.

Generally, 
the 
participants 

discussed ways to mitigate and 
intervene in situations where 
Halloween costumes target and 
present microaggressions toward 
specific cultural identities, span-
ning the gamut from ethnically 
charged to gender-based outfits. 
One guideline in this process 
was for students to “expect and 
accept a lack of closure” on the 
issue in general.

“I came here today because 

I feel strongly about my Indian 
cultural heritage, and so I iden-
tify with people whose cultures 
are portrayed in Halloween cos-
tumes,” said LSA senior Sana 
Isaac. “So I think it’s an impor-
tant topic and one I’d like to hear 
other perspectives on.”

The dialogue began with a list 

of discussion guidelines and a 
presentation of different defini-
tions of cultural appropriation.

One of the first exercises 

involved participants walking 
to one of three different colored 
pieces of tape — green, yellow 
and red — on the ground for any 
given scenario presented. The 
green piece represented indi-

SCOTUS case 
prompts push 
for independent 

commissions

BY CAITLIN REEDY

For the Daily

The League of Women Vot-

ers of the Ann Arbor Area 
hosted a redistricting town 
hall forum Thursday night 
in the Ann Arbor District 
Library.

The event, which drew 

about 40 people, was mod-
erated by Susan Smith, vice 
president of program plan-
ning for the League of Women 
Voters of Michigan.

The League of Women Vot-

ers is a national nonpartisan 
organization aimed at citizen 
empowering voters through 
education about various pol-
icy areas. Thursday’s forum 
was one of a slate of events 
statewide focusing on redis-
tricting, which refers to the 
process of redrawing elector-
al districts. Electoral districts 
demarcate the geographical 
areas Michigan’s legislators 
represent in Congress.

Currently, Michigan’s leg-

islature draws the district 
lines for the state. States also 
have the option of redrawing 
district lines through inde-
pendent, nonpartisan com-
missions.

Smith said the events were 

prompted by a Supreme Court 
case handed down in June, 
in which the court ruled an 
independent 
redistricting 

commission in Arizona was 
a constitutional method of 
redistricting.

Following the ruling, she 

said, it was clear that state 
residents 
were 
passionate 

about the issue, with many 
reaching out to the League of 
Women Voters to discuss the 
possibility of an independent 
commission in Michigan.

“What we do now creates 

a problem in Michigan,” she 
said. “The process that we are 
using now is one where the 
politicians are choosing the 
voters instead of the voters 
choosing their elected offi-
cials. “This is not democracy; 
this is the reverse of the way 
it is supposed to be in a demo-
cratic country.”

Nancy Schewe, president 

of the League of Women Vot-
ers for the Ann Arbor Area, 
echoed Smith’s sentiment and 

said the issue was important 
for Ann Arbor residents.

“We are concerned about 

the way our legislative dis-
tricts are drawn in Michi-
gan,” Smith said. “We are in 
a statewide education cam-
paign about the consequences 
of redistricting, and possible 
solutions.”

During the forum, present-

ers discussed whether there 
was gerrymandering in Mich-
igan — the practice of redraw-
ing lines to get a particular 
partisan outcome during the 
election.

Smith noted that in the 

most recent election for the 
Michigan House of Represen-
tatives, Republicans won 46 
percent of the vote, yet man-
aged to obtain 59 percent of 
the seats in the House.

Republicans currently con-

trol both the state House and 
Senate, and were the majority 
party the last time redistrict-
ing occurred after the 2010 
census.

“Partisan 
politicians 

manipulate elections to keep 
themselves and their party 
in power. The Republicans 
do it, the Democrats do it,” 
Smith said. “(Gerrymander-

Michigan 

Conservative Energy 
Forum stresses need 

for bipartisanhip

BY CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

The Michigan Conservative Ener-

gy Forum spoke to the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans on 
Thursday about energy policy and its 
relationship with bipartisanship.

The event, held in the Michigan 

Union, focused on the activities of the 
MCEF, which was formed in 2013 in 
response to the impending expiration 
of a number of energy bills.

MCEF Program Director Katie 

O’Connell said the goal was to give 
conservatives a voice at a time when 
the discussion on energy policy was 
led by Democrats, and to remove ste-
reotypes that Republicans don’t pri-
oritize taking care of the environment. 
 

In particular, she said a lack of 

education led to inefficient political 

and legislative efforts in energy pol-
icy, especially when it came to new 
technology developments.

“You get a lot of loud characters 

that just say whatever they think is 
true at the highest decibel possible,” 
O’Connell said. “One of the big things 
we run into are people who know the 
technology from 2005. Well, in the 
past 10 years, solar, wind, biomass 
and hydro have all take off because 
we’ve given them a great opportu-
nity.”

The 
organization 
encourages 

the adoption of an “all of the above” 
approach to energy policy, aiming to 
diversify Michigan’s energy portfo-
lio by including multiple sources of 
renewable energy.

O’Connell said the organization 

believes expanding renewable energy 
resources and increasing energy effi-
ciency will result in improvements 
in several areas, including jobs and 
the economy, national security and 
health.

The College Republicans estab-

lished a partnership with MCEF last 
year.

Information 
senior 
Madeline 

Jursek, chair of the College Repub-
licans, said she plans to continue to 
foster this discussion and take part 
in sustainability and environmental 
groups across campus.

She added that she also hopes to 

collaborate with the University’s 
chapter of College Democrats on this 
issue.

“I think it’s really important, espe-

cially as young republicans, to show 
that we do care about the environ-
ment and are looking for clean energy 
opportunities and sources,” Jursek 
said. “I think it’s really strong that we 
show the community on campus that 
we can be Republicans and still care 
about the environment.”

LSA senior Gabriel Leaf, who 

serves on the MCEF Leadership 
Council, said misinformation and 
misunderstanding from both par-
ties are the cause of many barriers in 
energy policy.

“Most hurdles come from people’s 

misunderstanding of what we’re 
doing, energy policy as a whole and 
conservative energy and how that 
can work towards more of a workable 
future for everyone,” Leaf said.

In addition, several members of 

the College Republicans noted they 
believe the public’s view of Republi-
can energy policy is not representa-
tive of the majority’s sentiment.

LSA freshman Jake Roodvoets 

stressed the importance of the MCEF 
in promoting the issue, which he said 
was vital to the state and national 
economies.

“Most of the time, Republicans 

focus more on money or the military, 
tax cuts and less spending regulation, 
but there are more priorities we have 
to look at,” Roodvoets said. “I think 
it’s a good thing this group is looking 
at that and promoting a solution many 
people like myself can agree with.”

O’Connell said she thought young 

people in particular had an impor-
tant voice on the issue, expressing 
the importance of younger citizens 
in instigating change in policy priori-
ties.

“Young people are the power-

house that makes things happen,” 
O’Connell said. “We need people who 
are passionate, and that starts at the 
grassroots level.”

spoke at the event, shared an 
anecdote about how he won the 
election primaries for commis-
sioner in 2010 by only one vote. 
Rabhi is currently a candidate for 
state representative.

Councilmember Sabra Briere 

(D–Ward 1), who has served on 
the council for five terms and is 
running uncontested to retain her 
seat, stressed that in addition to 
voting, it’s also important for stu-
dents to contact elected represen-
tatives to voice their concerns.

“Your voice is really impor-

tant,” she said. “If you don’t vote, 
the decisions that people make on 
your behalf may not be the deci-
sions they want you to make. Your 
tasks as voters and as activists in 
the Democratic party is to make 
sure they hear from you.”

Ann Arbor resident Chip Smith, 

who is running uncontested for 
City Council in the 5th Ward but 
faces opposition from a write-in 
campaign from Kevin Leeser, a 
nurse at the University of Michi-
gan Health System, cited housing 
affordability as a top issue in his 
campaign that was relevant to 
students.

Smith suggested housing costs 

led to many University students 
leaving Michigan after graduat-
ing.

“We are tired of seeing the best 

and brightest leaving the state,” 
he said. “I think it’s very impor-
tant to figure out how to create an 
environment that invites you to 
participate, help shape the com-
munity you live in and gives you 
the option to stay.”

In an interview, College Demo-

crats Chair Max Lerner, a Public 
Policy senior, said holding events 
like Thursday’s meeting is impor-
tant in bridging the gap between 
students and politicians.

“Any time we can connect 

local leaders with students, we’re 
reducing that gap and creating an 
environment for more effective 
politics and more effective gover-
nance,” Lerner said.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Briere said she 
hopes students who attended the 
meeting left feeling more confi-
dent in themselves as voters.

“I hope they leave with a more 

positive sense of how important 
their involvement in local poli-
tics is, because the sexy stuff is 
all national politics, we know 
that,” she said. “Yet we don’t see 
how much difference one vote can 
make in national politics but we 
can really see it in local politics.”

up into a University-wide stra-
tegic plan,” Martin said. “In 
LSA, there are a handful of dif-
ferent discrete activities that 
we are doing that are all work-
ing together.”

Martin also touched on how 

diversity could be increased in 
nonacademic areas.

He said the University’s 

Office for Student Life is cur-
rently engaging in a strategic 
planning process as well.

“We know that on campus 

at various times and in various 
places that we do not have a 
climate that fully embraces the 
diversity of our student popu-
lation,” he said. “A lot of what 
happens here that is social, 
cultural and academic happens 
out in the residence halls in our 

community and it’s important 
that we try to have the best cli-
mate we possibly can.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Patrick 

Mullan-Koufopoulos said he 
thought the new diversity plan 
was important moving forward 
for the University.

“I think that it’s a really 

interesting plan and I support 
it wholeheartedly,” he said. “I 
think that as a campus we need 
more diversity and I think that 
we are moving in the right 
direction.”

Martin also discussed the 

recent faculty senate vote to 
support the delay of releasing 
course evaluations. Many fac-
ulty members have addressed 
concerns with the Universi-
ty’s current course evaluation 
mechanisms and have advocat-
ed for revisions before the data 
is released.

Martin said this information 

should be available to students.

“This is something that my 

leadership team and I have dis-
cussed over the past few weeks 
and although this is not a unan-
imous view, it is the view of the 
college that students should 
have access to course evalua-
tions,” he said.

He said the administration 

has reached a standstill on the 
issue, but he believes students 
have the power to get the infor-
mation.

“We are sort of at an 

impasse,” Martin said. “As you 
all know, you as students have 
agency here. You can obtain 
the data, but it may be costly. 
You’ve got resources through 
Central Student Government 
or LSA Student Government 
that could go ahead and get the 
data and publish it in some way. 
In my judgment it would be the 
right thing for these data to be 
available.”

In addition to discussing 

the University’s diversity plan 
and course evaluations, Martin 
fielded questions on a recent 
CSG proposal to list mental 
health resources in course syl-
labi, the University’s race and 
ethnicity 
requirement 
and 

dual-degree programs.

One student asked about 

why some schools, like the 
Ford School of Public Policy, 
do not allow students to com-
plete majors in two different 
schools.

“This is a decision that the 

Ford School has made,” he said. 
“We would be happy to have 
dual-degree students with the 
other schools and colleges. It 
doesn’t make any sense to tell 
a student who’s going to com-
plete the requirement for a 
major that they cannot get the 
real major on their transcript.”

viduals being “OK” with the 
scenario, the yellow piece with 
them being unsure or slightly 
uncomfortable and the red 
piece with them feeling firmly 
that the situation was unac-
ceptable.

Scenarios presented a vari-

ety of potentially offensive 
costume 
possibilities, 
from 

someone of native ancestry 
wearing a “sexy native prin-
cess” costume, to someone 
wearing a “white trash” cos-
tume by taping pieces of crum-
pled paper to themselves, to a 
Black person dressing as Jus-
tin Bieber.

Other scenarios intention-

ally did not reveal the identi-
ties of the costume wearer. 
For instance, one situation 
addressed 
someone 
wear-

ing a Caitlyn Jenner costume; 
another addressed someone 
dressing as President Barack 
Obama.

After completing the exer-

cise, 
participants 
split 
off 

into small groups to discuss 
their spectrum of views. Most 
agreed that the intent of the 

wearer was important, but that 
wearing a person or identity 
as a costume carries weight 
regardless.

Rackham 
student 
Mike 

Varano 
acknowledged 
the 

range of intent in cultural 
appropriation, 
from 
some 

making uninformed decisions 
and others perpetuating ste-
reotypes intentionally.

“I think that’s a huge prob-

lem,” he said in an interview 
before the event began. “I 
would lean towards the direc-
tion of … people not having 
enough sensitivity or maybe 
questioning 
the 
decisions 

they’re making around these 
things. And I think that we 
could do to have more aware-
ness and reflection about even 
costumes that are meant to be 
jokes especially.”

During one exercise, the 

participants got back together 
in a circle to discuss their con-
versations. 
Many 
scenarios 

revealed a variety of perspec-
tives.

For example, the group was 

split with regard to the “white 
trash” costume. Some felt that 
the 
particular 
scenario 
of 

wearers taping crumpled paper 
to themselves was acceptable, 

as it was a clever play on words 
and not a direct attempt at 
stereotyping. Others believed 
that any stereotyped attempt 
to wear a marginalized group, 
such as white people of low 
socioeconomic standing, was 
dangerous.

The “sexy native princess” 

scenario was highlighted for 
being both appropriative and 
sexist. 
LSA 
senior 
Corine 

Rosenberg pointed out the 
“exotic erotic” phenomenon — 
that people who are deemed 
“exotic” for arbitrary reasons 
can be harmfully sexualized 
and dehumanized.

The dialogue then turned 

to acting out skits to promote 
bystander intervention, allow-
ing participants to tag each 
other in to intervene while 
another participant pretended 
to wear an appropriative cos-
tume.

Being able to educate the 

appropriative wearer became 
complicated, as scenarios in 
which these costumes were 
worn at parties made it more 
difficult 
for 
bystanders 
to 

effectively inform the wearer. 
Potential issues in the “party” 
situation included the wearer 
being drunk or the environ-

ment being too casual to inter-
vene.

During group discussion, 

LSA junior Adedolapo Adeniji 
was interested in pointing 
out why costumes of particu-
lar people — such as Caitlyn 
Jenner, Nicki Minaj, Barack 
Obama and Trayvon Martin — 
become popular.

“Dress up as a celebrity, 

but why are you costuming 
(them)?” she asked.

Particular 
attention 
was 

given to the Caitlyn Jenner cos-
tume, which is expected to be 
a top-selling choice this year. 
Many felt that any attempt to 
appropriate an identity, such 
as transgender, Black, Native 
American or Mexican, in par-
ticular, is harmful.

The general consensus was 

that there is a clear issue with 
being able to wear these identi-
ties as a costume for the night, 
as opposed to being someone 
who actively lives with these 
identities and the stereotypes 
that come with them.

“You don’t want to give peo-

ple the idea that you can wear 
this identity and then throw it 
away,” said LSA senior Ivory 
Bradley during group discus-
sion.

ing) all depends on which party is 
in power … and how these lines are 
drawn impacts policy issues.”

Among attendees at the forum, 

several concerns were raised, 
namely how Michigan compares 
to redistricting practices in other 
states.

Seven states, including Cali-

fornia and Arizona, currently 
use independent commissions to 
redistrict the state, which Smith 
said mitigated the consequences 
of gerrymandering.

Bob King, a former president 

of the United Auto Workers 
who attended the event, said he 
thought independent commis-
sions would be beneficial for the 
state.

“I think if there were a better 

way to set districts with an inde-
pendent commission it would 
make our government a lot more 
responsive and a lot more demo-
cratic,” King said. “I’m tired of 
gridlock in the government. I’m 
tired of polarization. I’m tired 
of people who don’t really care 

what the citizens think.”

However, Smith and Schewe 

noted that changing the way 
Michigan is redistricted is a long 
process, 
requiring 
long-term 

commitment. Changing redis-
tricting methods would require 
an amendment to the Michigan 
constitution. This can happen by 
either the introduction of a pro-
posed amendment by a legisla-
tor, which, in turn, will be voted 
on by the legislature or a citizen 
petition for a statewide ballot 
question on the issue.

After the event, Ann Arbor 

resident Vince Caruso said he 
thought the Ann Arbor area in 
particular was suffering from 
the effects of partisan redistrict-
ing.

“I think we are a laughing-

stock in some ways with our 
district in particular being so 
gerrymandered,” Caruso said. 
“Several sources I’ve checked 
have labeled our district one of 
the worst in the country. It’s not 
a good representation, I think we 
are better than that.”

Scientists ‘go bananas’ for new application of 
fruit protein as method for treating viruses

‘U’ prof. leads 

research to 
mitigate side 

effects of BanLec

BY TOM MCBRIEN

Daily Staff Reporter

The banana: a favorite fruit, 

a preferred source of potas-
sium and the source of a mol-
ecule that could fight some of 
the world’s deadliest viruses.

Scientists have known for 

years that a protein inside 
bananas called banana lec-
tin, or BanLec, has powerful 
antiviral properties. The only 
problem: BanLec also over-
stimulates the immune sys-
tem, resulting in harmful side 
effects that make it useless as 
a medicine.

However, an internation-

al team of researchers, led 
by Internal Medicine Prof. 
David 
Markovitz, 
recently 

announced that it was able to 
engineer a special version of 
BanLec called H84T that has 
the virus-fighting abilities of 
normal BanLec without the 
harmful side effects.

Though Markovitz’s team 

is focusing on the anti-influ-
enza properties of the modi-
fied BanLec protein, they also 
found 
preliminary 
results 

suggesting it could be used to 
treat HIV, hepatitis C, Ebola 
and other viruses.

“One scenario we’d love 

to see but are — again — far 
from, is that it works against 
other important respiratory 
viruses like MERS and SARS,” 
Markovitz said. “So one could 
imagine someone ill with a 
viral pneumonia coming in 
and you don’t know what’s 
causing it, but you could treat 

them with the modified Ban-
Lec before you know what the 
diagnosis is.”

BanLec, like all of the lec-

tin class of proteins, is a spe-
cial molecule that binds to 
sugars on the surface of cells. 
Because sugars are a very 
diverse class of molecules, 
cells cover themselves in dif-
ferent sugars to send various 
messages to other cells. When 
proteins like BanLec bind to 
those sugars, they are able to 
alter which messages get sent 
and received.

“Sugars offer a very sophiti-

cated way to regulate biology 
because they’re so complicat-
ed and they can be put togeth-
er in many different forms,” 
Markovitz said. “For example, 
you can have multiple man-
noses interacting with other 
sugars. They can be on cer-
tain proteins covering certain 
structures of the protein and 
not other structures.”

In BanLec’s case, binding to 

mannoses — sugar molecules 
that bind to other molecules 
— on the outside of viruses 
blocks those viruses from 
binding to human cells. As a 
result, they lose the ability to 
invade human cells and will 
die out instead of establishing 
an infection.

Unfortunately, 
BanLec 

can also bind to multiple 
mannose-containing 
struc-

tures on the outside of special 
immune cells called T-cells. 
When a T-cell binds to some-
thing in multiple places, it 
causes inflammation, leading 
to swelling and pain. Usually, 
this reaction is a healthy part 
of the immune system. But 
when it results from BanLec’s 
attachment to the mannose 
structures on T-cells, it can 
cause a dangerous reaction 

akin to a system-wide allergic 
response.

The research team study-

ing BanLec, which included 
26 scientists from around the 
world, used a host of tech-
niques to discover whether or 
not they could tweak BanLec 
to remove these side effects.

“We like to approach these 

questions by taking advantage 
of a wide range of expertise,” 
Markovitz said. “One of the 
nice things about this work is 
that it employed many differ-
ent modalities. We had virol-
ogy, glycobiology, molecular 
biology, immunology, animal 
models, dynamic modeling, 
NMR and crystallography. A 
lot of these are very specific 
techniques, so no one would 
know how to do all of these on 
their own.”

Using these techniques, the 

researchers discovered that 
a single structural change in 
BanLec removed the danger-
ous side effects. They shifted 
a structure that had previous-
ly shared a special chemical 
bond with another structure. 
This 
bond 
separated 
two 

sugar-binding sites, meaning 
they could both attach to a 
T-cell separately, stimulating 
inflammation. By moving one 
of these structures, the bond 
disappears and the two bind-
ing sites act more like one. 
The structures then lose the 
ability to activate T-cells.

Markovitz said there’s a 

long way to go before H84T 
will be available as a drug. 
The team still has to figure 
out how to make H84T in 
large, chemically pure quan-
tities, hire private companies 
to perform full toxicology 
reports and see if the protein 
is as powerful if given 24, 48 
or 72 hours after infection 

instead of the four hours used 
for the first study. After that, 
clinical trials on humans can 
begin.

As the researchers contin-

ue to study and refine H84T, 
they are also focusing on how 
best to bring it to market.

“This is part of why aca-

demia 
is 
fun,” 
Markovitz 

said. “You get to do all sorts 
of different things, and one 
of them can be trying to make 
something 
come 
to 
mar-

ket. So that’s what we hope. 
But we’ve got a long way to 
go before getting to human 
treatment.”

As part of this commer-

cialization 
effort, 
Markov-

itz’s team is working with the 
University’s Office of Tech 
Transfer to brainstorm how 
best to bring H84T to market, 
assuming it continues to show 
promise.

Markovitz said he hopes 

this research inspires more 
scientists to research other 
modified sugar-binding pro-
teins.

“What we hope is that this 

will embolden other groups 
who are totally unrelated to 
us to take a look at lectins and 
see whether they could modi-
fy them in a targeted manner 
to treat other diseases that we 
wouldn’t do because there are 
only so many hours in a day,” 
Markovitz 
said. 
“Another 

thing is that it opens up the 
whole idea — and I don’t want 
to overstate our contribution 
because people had thought 
about using lectins as anti-
virals long before we got in 
the field — but I think this is 
another indication that more 
specific therapy against the 
sugars on viruses might be 
effective.”

4 — Friday, October 30, 2015

Last Friday marked the beginning 

of the three-day Yalla Vote sum-
mit conference at the University of 
Michigan-Dearborn. Hosted by the 
Arab American Institute, a national 
nonprofit, the conference aimed to 
provide refugees from the Middle 
East the chance to engage with presi-
dential candidates ahead of the 2016 
election. One of the keynote speakers 
was Democratic presidential candi-
date Martin O’Malley.

Before O’Malley spoke, three pan-

elists — Radhia Fakhrildeen and Noor 
Al Dabbagh from Iraq and Moustafa 
Assad from Syria — discussed their 
experiences migrating to the Unit-
ed States with me and the rest of 
 

the auditorium.

After the panel, there was a break 

in the conference while O’Malley 
arrived. Minutes before O’Malley 
gave his speech, he met the pan-
elists personally in a small room 
next to the auditorium. He came 
into the center of a circle of chairs 
where the refugees were sitting. 
The press buzzed around the edges 
of the circle. While he placed his 
hand on his chest and nodded his 
head and listened to each of their 
names, I couldn’t help but feel that 
this breakout circle was more about 
the refugees meeting O’Malley 
than O’Malley really hearing and 
addressing the refugees’ concerns.

If O’Malley had been at the panel, 

he could have spent his time in the 
small room engaging in a real, pro-
ductive conversation with the refu-
gees about how to solve the asylum 
process — the means by which 
refugees seek protection granted 
by the United States. Instead, he 
spent the time hearing the refugees 
recap the stories they had just told. 
He stated that he wants the United 
States to accept more refugees, but 
he did not generate a dialogue about 
how the United States is going to 
accommodate them. After all, he 
was sitting among Fakhrildeen, Al 
Dabbagh and Assad, who all have 
valuable insights into how the pro-
cess works, or more accurately, 
 

didn’t work.

My feeling was reinforced once 

O’Malley exited the small breakout 
room and entered the auditorium to 
give his speech.

O’Malley called for the United 

States to admit 65,000 Syrian refu-
gees. As of September, the United 
States has accepted 1,500 refugees. 
Last month, the Obama administra-
tion announced it will increase that 
number to 10,000 in 2016.

Beyond these numbers, O’Malley 

noted how some leaders of the Unit-
ed States are shaping a problematic 
culture.

“Ben Carson flat 

out said he would 
not be comfortable 
with a president 
who 
happened 

to 
be 
Muslim,” 

O’Malley 
said. 

“One 
wonders, 

from a man who 
understands 
the 

value of education, 
what sort of mes-
sage that sends to 
Muslim American 
little boys and girls 
studying American history.”

O’Malley called for the need of 

a culture shift: away from Islamo-
phobia and xenophobia and toward 
an understanding of the pain 
and struggles refugees face and 
a reminder that all of us should 
know our country is made up 
 

of immigrants.

“The image of our nation is not a 

barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of 
Liberty,” he said.

Accepting more refugees is the 

moral thing to do (O’Malley asked 
the audience, “If they don’t come, 
how is it going to affect our soul?”) 
and it has garnered support from 
the International Rescue Commit-
tee, other presidential candidates 
like Hillary Clinton and more 
than 100,000 signatures through 
an online petition. Nonetheless, 
O’Malley’s call to action did not get 
at the root of the problem voiced by 
the refugees I heard that day.

During the panel, the refugees 

didn’t spend time telling us about 
their time in Iraq or Syria and didn’t 

spend time telling us about their cur-
rent life in the United States. What 
they did describe was the lengthy 
struggle they endured with the 
Department of Homeland Security 
once in the United States attempt-
ing to gain citizenship. This transi-
tional period is problematic — the 
time when the most intense suffer-
ing and pain of refugees occurs. This 
transitional period is what needs 
O’Malley’s and all leaders’ attention.

Noor Al Dabbagh arrived in the 

United States in January 2014 with 

her 
husband 

and son and 
couldn’t 
get 

a job because 
she and her 
husband’s 
work 
autho-

rizations 
wouldn’t pro-
cess. Addition-
ally, 
because 

they had yet 
to receive asy-
lum 
status, 

they did not 

qualify for government assistance or 
medical insurance.

Radhia Fakhrildeen’s husband’s 

asylum application was denied upon 
entry. This has separated him from 
his family for almost a year now.

O’Malley did briefly address the 

asylum system, saying it needs to be 
modernized so that problems like 
these don’t occur, but he did not 
specify how this would happen, what 
DHS’ role should play and any other 
measures for how to improve the 
process of being granted asylum. 

It is wonderful that O’Malley 

wants to inspire each American to 
welcome refugees with open arms. 
However, his call to action lacked 
concrete plans that left me feeling 
more overwhelmed by the problem 
than inspired by his solution.

If 65,000 refugees are coming, are 

we going to be hearing 65,000 stories 
just like the ones of Fakhrildeen, Al 
Dabbagh and Assad?

Asylum process needs attention

T

he student lifestyle requires 
a lot of time spent sitting 
down. We sit in lecture halls 

and 
libraries 

and on the bus 
to class. And if 
we’re not sitting, 
we’re 
walking 

(or the more cre-
ative and rushed 
among 
us 
are 

skateboarding, 
biking or maybe 
just 
running) 

across campus to 
get 
somewhere 

or other. Some-
times we go to the gym or sports 
practice, where we can move our 
bodies and get sweaty and gross, but 
often it’s not for the point of feeling 
joy in the action — it’s to lose weight 
or burn calories or change the way 
we look. It’s all too easy to tune out 
the way a movement or action makes 
us feel, especially in a stressful 
schedule packed with classes, work 
obligations and extracurriculars.

But that’s the whole point of Nia, 

a 
dance-fusion 
exercise 

form that’s been around 
since the early 1980s. Nia 
stands for both non-impact 
aerobics (that’s the boring 
one) 
and 
neuromuscular 

integrative action, and the 
word itself also means “pur-
pose” in Swahili. It’s some-
thing I never know how to 
describe to people when I try to tell 
them that I do it. It’s dance and yoga, 
martial arts and a great workout. 
It’s challenging and so, so reward-
ing. It draws on elements of jazz 
and Feldenkrais and more, while 
still taking into consideration the 
way the body is put together, the 
way joints work and the way mus-
cles move. Nia is the original fusion 
exercise that combines three mar-
tial arts, three dance arts and three 
healing arts.

“It doesn’t just borrow move-

ments from those, it borrows the 
principles,” said Megan Sims, a Nia 
instructor at the Ann Arbor YMCA, 
A2 Yoga and several other venues 
around town.

Sims is also the owner of Me-

Again Dance Healing & Fitness, a 
counseling business based in the 
greater Ann Arbor area that pro-
vides therapy through methods such 
as interpretive dance and is geared 
toward helping each individual grow 
and find themselves.

“It’s very structured,” she added. 

“There’s just freedom within the 
structure to move at your own level 
or your own way.”

Nia does this by drawing on 52 

unique movements and 13 principles, 
connecting mind and body in a way 
that doesn’t happen in most people’s 
day-to-day walks across the Diag or 
time spent on a treadmill.

Of her own practice, Sims said, 

“Nia is my therapist, Nia is my gym 
… As a Nia teacher, I get to really 
express my authentic self on a daily 
basis, and I think that’s a really 
great opportunity.”

Sims teaches Nia to people in 

wheelchairs, people with Parkin-
son’s disease and people who have 
difficulty moving, as well as to 
people who are more physically 
able. She firmly believes that it can 
be valuable for everyone. No matter 
who you are or where you’re coming 
from, Nia can be something that’s 
meaningful, and it can help each 
dancer to feel whole.

“The research is finally catch-

ing up to what dancers have always 

known: that you have to move 
your body every day to feel good,” 
 

Sims said.

I find that to be true when I take 

daily walks around my neighborhood 
but more so in gym dates and partic-
ularly during my weekly hour of Nia, 
where I’m encouraged to go barefoot, 
where I can express pent-up stress 
with sharp punches or let emotions 
drip out through languid spinal rolls. 
While doing Nia, I allow myself to 
forget whatever’s on my mind, what-
ever’s weighing me down. Instead, I 
pour myself wholly into the motions, 
the sensation of that movement, and 
that’s what I’m focusing on — the act 
of dancing, not what it looks like so 
much as how it feels and whether or 
not it feels good. The whole point of 
Nia is to find joy in the movement, 
and honestly, that’s never hard to do.

Yes, dancing can be intimidating. 

At my first Nia class, I had absolutely 
no idea what was going on. There 
were mirrors plastering the class-
room walls, and I didn’t know where 

to put my feet or how to move my 
arms. But the thing about Nia is that 
it stays with you.

“Most people who take it take it 

more than once a week,” Sims said. 
“Many people take it two to three 
times a week, if they can.”

Once it gets into your routine, it’s 

hard to go without it (after all, why 
bother?). My Nia class is that one 
hour a week when I allow myself to 
forget about everything except the 
present moment. The clarity I get 
from this weekly routine is invalu-
able and infinitely more rewarding 
than a straight-backed walk across 
the Diag with a backpack in tow.

“You know you got a great work-

out,” Sims said. “You feel happier 
than when you walked in, and you 
feel like your mind has gotten a 
workout as well in some way.”

But there’s also so much more 

built into the form itself, and one of 
these principles is called Awareness 
of Dancing Through Life.

“Even as you’re driving, you’re 

putting away dishes, you’re walking 
to work, you’re shaking hands with 

someone — all of those move-
ments can be part of your life 
dance,” Sims continued. “And 
if you feel awareness in your 
movement, then you’re con-
nected to yourself, you’re 
connected 
to 
your 
body, 

you’re connected to people 
— you’re connected to the 
moment. That’s a pretty good 

way to live.”

If the life-dance of a college stu-

dent consists of sitting in class or sit-
ting down to study (with some gym 
time or sports practice thrown into 
the mix), how much joy can come 
from those sorts of motions? I’ve 
dedicated this entire article to Nia, 
and maybe I don’t have you con-
vinced, but it’s almost impossible 
to pin down what exactly it is if you 
aren’t already familiar with it for 
yourself. Like Sims said, “Nia is like 
chocolate — you have to try it.”

So go ahead — start dancing 

through life. Start being aware. Put 
on some fun tunes and walk to your 
next class with a bit of a spring in 
your step. And if you’re feeling too 
self-conscious to skip through Cen-
tral Campus on your way to class, try 
dropping in for a free hour of Nia at 
A2 Yoga. At least there, you know no 
one will be watching.

NOTABLE QUOTABLE

We have nothing to fear from

FROM THE DAILY

G

ov. Rick Snyder (R) recently signed into law an eight-bill 
package that aims to reform Michigan’s civil asset forfeiture 
laws. These laws allow the police to take citizens’ property, 

including televisions, cars, cash and houses, if it is believed to have been 
used in or acquired by way of criminal activity. The police department 
is then free to use those assets as it sees fit. Even if a person is not 
charged or convicted of a crime, he or she is assumed guilty and must 
go to court to get their property back.

Cease the seizures

Civil asset forfeiture laws need further reform

The reform legislation raises the standard 

for civil asset forfeiture from a preponderance 
of evidence to clear and convincing evidence. 
It has also increased the reporting and 
transparency of civil asset forfeiture. These 
changes are necessary and long overdue, but 
they are also not nearly enough. It is imperative 
that the standard of civil asset forfeiture is 
raised to “beyond a reasonable doubt” — the 
highest level of proof in the legal system. 
Further, the citizen must be presumed innocent 
and the funds raised by civil asset forfeiture 
must be used for the state’s general fund, not 
primarily for police departments. Only then 
could this matter of civil asset forfeiture be 
considered resolved.

Civil asset forfeiture laws became widely 

used throughout the United States as part 
of the War on Drugs in the early 1980s. The 
rationale behind these laws, generally, is that 
they deter criminal activity, punish criminals, 
prevent further criminal activity and raise 
funds for more crime-fighting. When used 
correctly, these laws make sense. Few 
would argue against the police confiscating 
contraband or using a drug lord’s profits 
from drug sales to help catch more criminals. 
However, it isn’t clear that this is how these 
laws actually play out. In fact, these laws 
have recently come under scrutiny because 
of many abuses that have been highlighted in 
the media, both in Michigan and nationwide.

An example of this abuse was reported 

by the Detroit Free Press, which details 
how a 72-year-old disabled cancer patient 
with a medical marijuana card was accused 
by the police of selling marijuana, then was 
handcuffed and had his house searched. The 
police found that he had extra marijuana 
seedlings, but never charged him with a 
crime. His personal property, including 
$11,000 in cash and his Dodge Journey, 
was still taken by the police. Many similar 
stories 
have 
surfaced, 
suggesting 
that 

this shakedown of a medical marijuana 
card-holder for money was not an isolated 

incident. Since there are legal and financial 
barriers to regaining property taken under 
civil asset forfeiture, many of these wrongs 
go uncorrected. According to the Michigan 
State Police, more than $24.3 million in cash 
and assets in 2013 were seized from Michigan 
citizens. The majority of these seizure cases 
went uncontested in court, despite the fact 
that many were not charged with a crime.

It has become increasingly apparent that 

civil asset forfeiture laws are designed in a way 
that at best does little to limit abuses and at 
worst encourages them. When police can profit 
from targeting individuals and squeezing them 
for their assets, it is hardly surprising that they 
do so.

The reforms signed into law by Snyder will 

make it slightly more difficult for police to 
abuse civil asset forfeiture. The government 
will be held to a higher standard to keep the 
seized property, but the burden will still be on 
the citizen to cough up legal fees and prove his 
or her innocence. The police still have incentive 
to abuse the laws, but their use of these laws will 
be documented more thoroughly and examined 
more carefully. Undoubtedly, abuses will 
decrease as a result of these reforms, but there 
is not enough protection for Michiganders.

Reform of civil forfeiture laws should 

not stop until the proceeds from civil asset 
forfeiture are used for Michigan’s general fund 
and the standards for seizing property are 
raised. The Institute for Justice recommends 
raising these standards by requiring a 
conviction before taking someone’s property. 
Michigan should follow this advice to make 
sure that the abuses stop and, considering the 
prevalence of this problem across the nation, 
other states should listen, too.

The abuses in the criminal justice system are 

simply too rampant, with the nation learning of 
something new nearly every day. While there 
is significant room for improvement in many 
aspects, at the very least, the police should be 
stopped from taking people’s possessions prior 
to a conviction.

CLAIRE BRYAN | VIEWPOINT

Cleaner air equals better 

health

 TO THE DAILY:

As a nursing student working in Univer-

sity of Michigan Health System hospitals, I 
have witnessed firsthand how the health of 
Michigan residents is negatively impacted 
by air pollution. Michigan relies heavily on 
coal-fired power plants for energy, yet the 
toxic chemicals released from burning coal 
are known to cause or exacerbate a variety 
of health conditions. These adverse health 
outcomes include asthma, cardiovascular 
disease and cancer. To put all of this into per-
spective, Michigan’s asthma rate is 25 per-

cent higher than the national average, and 
residents suffer the 10th-highest death rate 
from cardiovascular disease in the nation.

It is evident that air pollution continues to 

threaten our health every day. This is why it 
is so important for the state government to 
support Michigan’s transition to clean energy 
sources through strong renewable energy and 
energy optimization standards.

As a future nurse, I am passionate about 

preventative health care and promoting the 
well-being of the populations I will care for. 
By improving Michigan’s air quality, resi-
dents will experience a healthier future and 
increased quality of life.

This column contains spoilers for 

this season of “The Leftovers.”

Show, don’t tell. Anyone who has 

ever taken a high school writing 
class could tell you what this axiom 
means. Truly 
excellent 
writing 
— 

whether 
it 

be in a short 
story, 
an 

epic 
poem, 

a 
screenplay 

or 
a 
TV 

column 
in 

The Michigan 
Daily — makes 
sure 
that 

every word speaks on its own. 
Words should be more than a 
straight path to a single conclusion, 
more than simple exposition telling 
readers what happened. Great 
writers let the reader experience 
the action through the character’s 
feelings, description and a well-
turned 
phrase. 
Great 
writers 

drop hints at what everything 
means, but they leave room for 
the reader’s independent thought. 
They acknowledge the gray areas 
in interpretation, and they let the 
mystery be.

The first season of HBO’s 

“The Leftovers” was one of the 
most stunning collections of epi-
sodes I saw in 2014. The show, 
which followed the residents of 
Mapleton, N.Y. after a devastat-
ing (and inexplicable) rapture-
like event claimed two percent 
of the world’s population, was an 
emotional powerhouse. In show-
ing the lives of those “left over” 
following the departure, “The 
Leftovers” mined the trauma for 
the vulnerable shell of human-
ity underneath. Entire episodes 
tracked the psychological arcs 
of side characters, yet the writ-
ers didn’t drop a single hint about 
the cause of the departure. “The 
Leftovers” was a show framed 
around a mysterious rapture, but 
it gave zero fucks about explain-
ing that mysterious rapture.

Brian 
Lowry 
of 
Variety 

said, in a review of the show’s 
first season, that he found 
“The 
Leftovers” 
’s 
premise 

far more engaging than its 
banal, 
unlikeable-character-

driven 
drama. 
Matt 
Zoller-

Seitz, the TV critic for New 
York Magazine (and one of my 
favorite entertainment writers), 
gave the “The Leftovers” ’s 
first episode a negative review, 
expressing that “the first few 
episodes don’t showcase enough 
artistry to justify all the slogging 
and weeping, the bloodied faces 
and broken hearts.”

You know, I get it. “The 

Leftovers” is a frustrating show 
to watch. The dialogue tells you 
almost nothing — I have a theory 
that a script for an hourlong 
episode of “The Leftovers” isn’t 
more than 15 pages, and mostly 
contains directions for where 
Justin Theroux is supposed 
to stand and take off his shirt. 
People in this show don’t say 
anything, and for an audience 
that is used to “Breaking Bad” 
monologues 
and 
Quentin 

Tarantino 
ramblings, 
this 

minimalist style can wear your 
patience a little too thin. The 
Guilty Remnant, the show’s 
resident weirdo cult, features 
completely mute characters that 
stand around in white clothes 
and smoke all day. Character 
Actress Amy Brenneman and 
Movie Star Liv Tyler spend most 
of the first season scrawling 
their thoughts on legal pads, 
keeping 
maddeningly 
silent 

while I begged them to just say 
something, dammit.

But 
ultimately, 
“The 

Leftovers” 
was 
saying 

something 
— 
is 
saying 

something, if you listen closely 
enough. It’s showing, not telling, 
the keys to understanding and 
appreciating the emotion and 
quietude of the show.

The first episode of the sec-

ond season begins with a cave, 
miles and years away from the 
departure and Mapleton. A 
pregnant cavewoman bears wit-
ness to a tragic earthquake that 
kills her entire tribe and family. 
She leaves the cave, goes to the 
beach, gives birth to her child 
and gets bitten by a snake. She 
dies with her baby in her arms, 
leaving her child to face civiliza-
tion and fend off future snakes 
alone. She dies on the sand, the 
water lapping at her toes.

Describing 
this 
scene 
in 

words does it no justice. First, 
it’s 
completely 
devoid 
of 

dialogue and isn’t shot according 
to typical continuity rules. The 
editing makes it unclear how 
much time is actually passing. 
For 
the 
scene’s 
ten-minute 

runtime, I wasn’t sure whether 
I was watching a sped-up and 
blurry few months or a single, 
stretched minute. The constant 
close-ups take the viewer out 
of the contextual reality of 
the scene. We know she’s a 
cavewoman, but she might as 
well be a familiar Mapletonian 
or a particularly dirty and naked 
woman who lives by the river 
near my house. It’s bizarre, yet 
poetically resonant.

“The Leftovers” is obsessed 

with 
the 
notion 
of 
the 

unexplained, 
the 
idea 
that 

God or nature or a snake’s 
venomous tongue can strike 
and wipe everything out. The 
unfathomable 
tragedy 
that 

made the world disappear on 
Oct. 14 is timeless and spaceless; 
death and disaster have been 
around since the Stone Age, and 
the feelings are still the same. 
“The Leftovers” says all of this 
without a single word, forcing its 
viewers to confront the tragedy 
with their own eyes and ears 
and make of the scene what they 
will. It’s a bold move, but one 
that “The Leftovers” isn’t afraid 
to make.

In last week’s episode, “Off 

Ramp,” former Guilty Remnant 
member Laurie Garvey finally 
decides to share her story. 
After spending the first season 
entrenched in twisted cult logic, 
Laurie has finally broken out, 
and is shopping her memoir 
around to publishers. She gets 
a call from one, who adored her 

words and thinks she has the 
potential to be the new authority 
on grief, loss and dealing with 
the departure. But there’s one 
caveat: the publisher thinks 
she needs to have some feeling 
injected into her book.

“There’s some heartbreaking 

stuff in here,” the editor says, but 
it lacks the necessary explication. 
He calls to mind the scene with 
the lighter (from season one 
of the show), where Laurie’s 
daughter gives her something 
to 
light 
her 
GR-mandated 

cigarettes 
with, 
emblazoned 

with the note, “Don’t forget me.” 
As we hear the irritating squawk 
of the editor’s voice, we see the 
same scene flash over the screen: 
Jill Garvey with her big eyes 
and baggy sweater, the sweetly 
childish Christmas wrapping 
and the gift that is supposed to 
let Laurie know how much her 
daughter misses her and wants 
her to come home.

“If you want people to connect 

with it, you have to tell them how 
it felt,” the editor reminds Laurie. 
Tell, don’t show. He wants her 
to see the realization that “the 
people that you left the family 
for are fuckin’ whackjobs!” He 
wants to see it all dressed up in 
pretty words, in a dialogue to 
the reader. “In that moment, I 
looked at the lighter and saw the 
mistake I’d made in leaving my 
children to fend for themselves 
while I join a cult and never 
speak to them again.” He wants 
some explanations, because the 
events and the images aren’t 
enough to speak for themselves.

That scene is emblematic of 

every nugget of unfair criticism 
“The Leftovers” suffers. That 
book editor wants more words — 
he wants clear characterization, 
cut-and-dry feeling, symbolism 
and 
falseness. 
He 
wants 
a 

good story, editorialized and 
picked over so it will fit on the 
shelf next to all those other 
departure 
memoirs. 
Many 

viewers want the same for “The 
Leftovers.” They want answers, 
explanation, tonal consistency 
and 
for 
the 
characters 
to 

fucking say something, to cut the 
melancholic piano music and 
throw some good monologues 
into the mix.

But “The Leftovers” collects 

its thoughts in a different way. It’s 
contemplative and image-driven 
in a way that nothing else on TV 
is; the dialogue comes secondary 
to the direction, acting and 
music. It’s slow and dreamlike, 
and the tone can change from 
melancholic (Laurie listening to 
the book editor tell her how to 
work through her grief) to fiery 
(Laurie physically attacking the 
book editor in his office) in a 
split second. It lets the moments 
speak for themselves. The image 
of the lighter is enough to make 
viewers realize the gravity of 
Laurie’s regret for abandoning 
her family — through showing, 
not telling.

CHLOE 

GILKE

I 

met Zach Ornelas, two-time 
Detroit Free Press Marathon 
champion and 2013 School 

of Education graduate, for drinks 
at Ashley’s on the Thursday night 
after his 
second 
win in 
Detroit. 
The race 
ran the 
morning 
of Oct. 
18, the 
Sunday 
of Fall 
Break. 
While 
most of 
Ann Arbor was nursing broken 
hearts and hangovers from the 
Michigan State game, Ornelas was 
pounding the streets of Detroit 
alone, six minutes ahead of second 
place in a field of 4,000 runners. 
His finishing time was two hours 
and 20 minutes, running a per-
fectly even (and perfectly insane) 
pace of five minutes, 21 seconds 
per mile for 26.2 miles.

But the race was the fun part. 

And the beer that followed. 

We sat at a gnarled table across 

from the bar at Ashley’s, under a 
sign that listed over 50 craft beers 
on tap, almost all of which Ornelas 
had tried before. “I drink a lot of 
beer,” he said, pulling an Ashley’s 
gold card labeled “Friend of the 
Owner” from his wallet. “You 
need beer for marathon training. 
It’s great for recovery. Lots of 
carbs, lots of calories and it relaxes 
you, which is really important.” 

I think I hiccupped. On the 

spectrum 
of 
fun 
activities, 

running marathons and drinking 
beer seem to fall on opposite 
sides, with little or no crossover 
besides a congratulatory pint at 
a marathon finish line. But then 
again, marathoning and college 
life itself seem incompatible.

There are several hurdles 

for college kids trying to train 
for marathons. First of all, 
our age is a factor, since it’s 
widely accepted that the “ideal” 
marathoning age begins in our 
late 20s and continues through 
our 30s and 40s. Where most 
athletic 
competitions 
are 

dominated by us, the young 
20-somethings (besides sports 
like gymnastics, where 12-year-
olds kick our butts), marathons 

have historically been won by 
an older crowd. Records prove 
it: Last October, physicist and 
running blogger Graydon Snyder 
graphed the ages of the fastest 
marathoners from 1967 to 2014, 
finding that the average “peak” 
age for marathoning was 28 years 
old for both men and women.

So what comes with age? 

That old standby: experience. 
Marathons differ from other 
competitions because of what they 
require — not (relative) speed or 
fast reflexes, but steady endurance 
and self discipline, gained from 
years of plugging in miles and 
strengthening our bodies to last 
for the long run. So in technical 
terms, our moms have a huge head 
start on us, just because they’ve 
been on their legs for longer. But 
our age isn’t the real limiting 
factor in marathon training — it’s 
our lifestyle.

“In college, we put ourselves 

through way worse than a 
marathon,” 
Ornelas 
said, 

laughing. “Think about it. If you 
set aside time each day to train, 
eat well, sleep and be smart 
about recovery, you’re not going 
to damage anything by running 
a marathon.”

Ornelas trained for his first 

marathon during his final fall 
semester at the University, while 
juggling 40 hours of student 
teaching per week for the School of 
Education. He was no stranger to 
running, having already competed 
four years on the University cross 
country and track teams, earning 
All-Great Lakes Region honors 
his senior cross country season. “I 
was one of those rare runners that 
are waiting for the marathon to 
race,” Ornelas said.

He continued, “Compared to 

shorter, faster races on the track, 
marathons are much easier to 
train for.” Ornelas relied on Alex 
Gibby, former University men’s 
cross country coach, to text him 
weekly 
marathon 
workouts, 

like hour-long runs at marathon 
pace. Though Ornelas’s strong 
foundation of collegiate running 
gave him an advantage over 
the average college kid, it made 
him perhaps more prone to 
overtraining.

“Going too fast, too soon or 

too often, is the biggest mistake 
you can make as a marathoner,” 
Ornelas said. “When I first started 

training, I ran every run at six-
minute mile pace and was going 
130 miles per week, about 20 miles 
a day, always alone. I woke up at 5 
a.m. to run before work, then went 
out again at 5 p.m. I was dedicated, 
but I wasn’t enjoying it.”

Overtraining wasn’t his only 

bad habit. Ornelas admits that he 
abandoned his social life, passing 
up nights out with friends who 
were visiting town to turn into 
bed early. He also neglected his 
diet — the marathoner remembers 
a particularly low point two weeks 
before winning the 2013 Detroit 
Free Press Marathon, when he 
was so low on money that dinner 
consisted of a can of soup, poured 
over a hotdog bun.

“Then again, my diet has never 

been very good,” said Ornelas, who 
holds the official cross country 
team record for chicken nuggets (50 
nuggets in 14 minutes). “I don’t eat 
fast food anymore. Still, something 
is always better than nothing — 
even if it’s unhealthy, with how 
much we run, marathoners have to 
take in fuel.”

In order to finish a marathon, 

Ornelas recommends that you 
run at least 40 miles per week, 50 
miles if you want to enjoy the race 
— a mileage sum that is probably 
more than many college students 
have ran before. Training is all 
about working up to the race: 
increasing 
your 
run 
length 

slowly, so that an hour-long run 
becomes 
comfortable; 
fueling 

properly and frequently, allowing 
your body to rebuild and endure; 
spending time recovering, giving 
yourself breaks from the stress 
of training, to focus instead on 
friends and family.

“Running is a passion, but it’s 

also just a hobby,” Ornelas said. 
“Go out with your friends. Recover 
more; go on long, easy runs. If your 
marathon is hard within the first 
10 miles, that’s a bad sign — the 
best races happen when you don’t 
think about the miles.”

The runner finished his drink, 

a quick sip, like a stop at a water 
station. “Nobody has to run 
marathons,” he said. “I love it and 
hate it, but I choose to run. And 
that’s rewarding enough.” 

Middlebrook hiccupped, so it 

turns out she is actually mortal, 

too. To ask her how it feels,

Marathoning for

Front Bottoms: 
All the emotions 

CONCERT REVIEW

Alt-rock band brings 
personal experience 

to the Majestic

By SELENA AGUILERA

For The Daily

Before all of the pop-punk kids 

crawled into every open crevice 
inside of the Majestic to see an 
emotional set from the The Front 
Bottoms, two bands played to a 
relatively unexcited crowd.

The opener was South Caroli-

na-based Elvis Depressedly. Matt 
Cothran started this lo-fi trio 
with his girlfriend back in 2011. 
If you ever want to hear a song 
about getting your heart broken, 
smoking weed, having sex and 
fucking up, look no further. Elvis 
Depressedly is the band for you.

Their performance was more 

than captivating — the music 
spilled onto the crowd and com-
manded everyone to sway left 
and right in unison. I was under 
a spell that the music gods had 
casted upon me. I thought drop-
ping out and becoming a groupie 
was the life for me if it meant 
that I could listen to this band 
every night for the next few 
months. Sadly, their set was cut 
short and I was brought back to 
reality. I patiently waited for the 
next band to take the stage while 
silently wishing Elvis Depressed-
ly played just one more song. Or 

two. Or twelve.

Four men then took the stage. 

These guys, with their full beards 
and New Balance shoes (not the 
cool ones, the dad looking ones), 
were called The Smith Street 
Band. This Austrailian band trav-
eled across the world for this tour 
and have the accents to prove it. 
Frontman Wil Wagner’s voice 
was especially cute — too bad I 
could hardly understand what he 
was shouting throughout the set. 
But, I have to give this band some 
props. I mean, when they started 
to play, they never stopped. Every 
song fell into the next with-
out missing a beat. The way the 
band maintained their energy 
the entire time was impressive 
to say the least. In comparison to 
Elvis Depressedly, however, The 
Smith Street Band’s set dragged. 
I wouldn’t ask for an encore, but 
the time was enjoyed as it lasted.

After heavy anticipation, the 

four total babes that make up The 
Front Bottoms walked on stage. 
Amidst the screaming “I love 
yous,” and effort made by every-
one to grab the band’s attention, 
I felt my skin shed and my inner 
fangirl emerge.

The stage was set under magen-

ta lights as bubbles started to fill 
the air. Balloons dropped from the 
ceiling and it felt as if I was trapped 
in some candy land I would have 
imagined when I was 10. I half 
expected to see Willy Wonka 
somewhere among the sweaty 

bodies that surrounded me.

Frontman Brian Sella’s voice 

sounded amateur, but that’s what 
made his performance so entic-
ing. It showed that he’s imperfect, 
just like everyone else. He made 
interactions with the crowd cre-
ating a personal experience and 
when he sang he closed his eyes. 
The other members did their 
part in contributing to the show, 
but had little emotion and inter-
action with the crowd. All eyes 
were on Sella, especially during 
their hit “Swimming Pool,” when 
his movements made it seem like 
he was making sweet love to his 
guitar. I’m positive that when 
he sang the lyrics, “And I will 
be alone probably the rest of my 
life,” tears started falling from 
the crowd collectively. They 
yanked emotions out of every-
one that night playing songs like 
“Maps,” and “Twelve Feet Deep.”

The majority of their set was 

from their new album, Back on 
Top. I’m not familiar with it, but 
I do know that they performed 
it extremely well. It didn’t mat-
ter that I didn’t know the words, 
the songs still wrecked my heart. 
They signed off with “Twin Sized 
Mattress,” and the 17-song set 
was over leaving everyone want-
ing more.

I guess now all I can do is 

spend my time drowning in cof-
fee as I count the days until The 
Front Bottoms make their way 
back to the mitten.

He explained that the visual 

aesthetic of “The Good Dinosaur” 
is rooted in landscape, noting that 
the film’s Director of Photography 
comes from a background of 
landscape painting. Pytko also 
mentioned that the team used 
U.S. Geological Survey data to 
inspire and sculpt the film’s 
backgrounds.

 “Those initial shots take a 

really long time because we’re 
trying to figure out the shot, 
but we’re also trying to figure 
out the overall pipeline for the 
show,” he said. “It’s not just 
about that shot, we’re trying to 
figure out the bigger challenges. 
It’s usually months and months 
of work.”

 Later in the presentation, 

Pytko screened around seven-to-
eight minutes of the film divided 
into a few different clips. Each of 
the clips centered on protagonists 
Arlo, a cute green Apatosaurus, 
and Spot, a mute cave-boy. One 

emotional scene involved fire-
flies and howling at the night sky. 
Another, surprisingly, involved 
a 
classic 
Western 
aesthetic, 

drawing visual inspiration from 
VistaVision-era 
Westerns 
like 

“The Searchers” and “Gunfight 
at the O.K. Corral.” Yet another 
(possibly 
the 
most 
beautiful 

sequence of computer animation 
I have ever witnessed) involved 
Arlo and Spot running through a 
giant flock of seagulls. 

 Each scene was lit absolutely 

beautifully, and Pytko gave us 
some insight into the process of 
lighting scenes in a digital space. 
He used terms heard frequently 
in real-life lighting like “key” 
and “fill,” but explained that 
there are distinct differences in 
virtual lighting.

 “We try to start from some 

realistic places. We start with 
physically based lights, so they 
sort of try to react like actual 
lights. But then because it’s in a 
virtual space, we have all these 
ways to break that relation-
ship and do what’s important 
for the visual story,” he said. He 

noted that digital lighting artists 
have the ability to decide which 
objects are affected by which 
lights no matter where they’re 
located, among other techniques 
that would be impossible in the 
real world.

 At the risk of sounding hyper-

bolic, these clips of “The Good 
Dinosaur” were the best-look-
ing animated films I have ever 
seen. The film’s natural features, 
rushing water, tall grass and 
night sky all felt photorealistic, 
yet blended perfectly with the 
more cartoony character mod-
els. The film is on another level 
of detail and gorgeous visual 
composition, even in compari-
son to recent beautiful Pixar 
projects like “Brave.” 

 Pytko told me that the pro-

duction process on the film from 
beginning to end took six years. 
That’s an astronomical amount of 
time (and money) to spend on one 
movie. 

 It shows. 
 “The Good Dinosaur” will be 

released in theaters nationwide 
on Nov. 25.

*Hotline blings*
Hello, friends. It’s me, Adam. 

I know we haven’t talked in a 
while, 
and 

yes, 
I 
read 

your 
texts. 

Yes, I know 
I 
had 
the 

read receipts 
on. 
Yes, 
I 

know I was 
tweeting 
at 

Justin Bieber 
instead 
of 

answering 
your voicemails. But that’s all in 
the past now, and I need to talk to 
you about “Hotline Bling.” 

Wait, 
slow 
down, 
I 
can’t 

understand 
you 
when 
you’re 

screaming like that. Why are you 
cursing so much? We’ve been 
talking for 30 seconds and I haven’t 
quoted a single philosopher; I 
thought you’d be impressed. 

Wait, don’t say another word. 

I know what’s wrong. You’re 
worried that Drake went too far 
with the “Hotline Bling” video. 
It’s the only thing you’ve seen on 
your timeline for the last week 
and you can’t stop listening to it, 
but it’s getting harder and harder 
to feel the magic — especially 
after they did that remake with 
Helmut the Pug. 

And, 
you 
know, 
I 
really 

can’t blame you for feeling that 
way. You can only see so many 
“Hotline Bling”/Merengue Mix 
mashups before it just isn’t fun 
anymore. As much as it hurts 
me to say this, maybe the game’s 
over. Maybe the hotline has just 
about blung its last bling. 

But I’m a glass-half-full kind 

of guy, so I’m gonna try to stay 
positive 
about 
this. 
“Hotline 

Bling” got to #2 on the Billboard 
charts and clocked in at about 120 
million plays on Spotify, which 
can only mean one thing: it’s only 
a matter of time before Drake 
formally changes his Instagram 
account from “Champagne Papi” 
to “The 6 God.” 

Now, if you turned all of your 

social media accounts into de 

facto “Hotline Bling” shrines 
like I did, rejoice! This transfer of 
power will go very smoothly for 
you. But if you thought you were 
too “cool” for the whole hotline 
fad, all I can say is that I hope you 
really like “Degrassi,” because 
you’ll be watching Wheelchair 
Jimmy get an erection on loop 
for the rest of eternity in the 
sixth circle of hell. You can’t play 
games with the 6 God. He moves 
in very mysterious ways, after all, 
and if you need to be reminded of 
what those strange moves can do 
to a guy, just take a look at Meek 
Mill’s Instagram. He’s putting 
#imnotacelebritydontcallmethat 
on his own pictures. Look at that 
new coat he got — Drake knocked 
him down so many pegs he forgot 
how to dress himself. It’s almost 
too painful to watch.

But 
before 
the 
coronation 

happens and we forget what it was 
like to live in a world where Drake’s 
face wasn’t on every denomination 
of Canadian currency, I’d like to 
take a moment to pause and reflect 
on how exactly we got to this 
bizarre juncture in the history of 
Western society. A half-Jewish 
Canadian actor named Aubrey 
just about took over hip hop with 
an R&B song about cell phones 
less than nine months after the 
new King of Compton released 
an album that critics were calling 
“Music’s Great American Novel.”

What the fuck is going on?
Now, if you’ll bear with me, I 

think you can find the answer to 
that question in the same place 
you go to find out whether you 
can avoid making eye contact 
with people in elevators — your 
cell phone. 

You don’t need me to tell you 

how essential cell phones have 
become in our post-postmodern 
post-2012 
Mayan 
Apocalypse 

wasteland, but, you know, really 
stop and think about them for 
a second. There has never been 
anything like the smartphone in the 
history of human civilization. 

The smartphone is a relatively 

cheap, 
incredibly 
portable, 

easy-to-use 
and 
increasingly 

ubiquitous personal omniscience 

device, which allows us to record 
and produce audiovisual and 
textual data about every single 
moment of our lives and share it, 
instantaneously, with every other 
smartphone user (and overworked 
NSA agent) on the planet. We 
document our own aging process 
by filling them with an absurd 
amount of bathroom selfies, we 
use them to construct and curate 
our own public image on a slew of 
social media platforms, they allow 
us to stay vocally and textually 
connected 
with 
friends 
and 

family who might be on a different 
continent altogether and we can 
even use them to arrange romantic 
liaisons outside the confines of our 
social milieu. 

In other words, smartphones 

have become an essential part 
of the way we function as social 
animals and, along the way, have 
gone beyond their basic use as 
telecommunication 
devices 
to 

become a fundamental part of our 
identities. It should come as no 
surprise, then, that scientists have 
begun to show that “cell phone 
separation anxiety” is an actual, 
real-life phenomena. When you 
leave your cell phone on the floor 
of the bathroom at Chipotle, you 
aren’t just leaving behind a hunk 
of rare-earth minerals extracted 
using 
ecologically 
disastrous 

methods that Apple forced a 
sweatshop-full of Chinese child 
laborers to make into an iPhone at 
gunpoint — you’re leaving behind a 
chunk of yourself. 

Which brings us back to Drake.
Cell phones are a part of all of 

us, but they seem to be especially 
essential for Drizzy. Have you ever 
stopped to think about how often 
he puts his hotline on the track? He 
has rapped about it on every single 
album or mixtape he has ever made. 
His voicemail is the only thing in 
his discography with more guest 
spots than Lil Wayne, and since 
Lil Wayne features are basically 
the treasury bonds of hip hop, that 
means Drake values his cell phone 
somewhere on par with Berkshire 
Hathaway stocks.

I’m particularly fascinated by 

the way Drake uses the cell phone 

HIP HOP COLUMN

The Passion of 
Aubrey Graham

in his songs, though, because I 
think it is probably the clearest 
demonstration of the 21st-century 
relevance of one of my favorite 
pretentious 
philosophisms: 

commodity fetishism. 

I know that you want to tell me 

to shut the fuck up and get back to 
playing PlayStation right now, but, 
again, I legitimately think this will 
help explain why we live in a world 
where Drake is killing on the 
Billboard charts and people are 
leaving Kendrick to play “Alright” 
into a half-empty room after 
Future gets done rapping about 
having sex in his Gucci flip-flops. 

I assume you’ve never read the 

first volume of “Capital” by Karl 
Marx, but having spent pretty 
much my entire life pretending to 
be a Leftist intellectual, I can tell 
you that it’s not all that hard to get 
the gist of w

Essentially, what Marx realized 

about commodities is that, like cell 
phones, they aren’t just neutral 
objects that we use to do a specific 
task, like texting your ex, or fulfill 
a basic need, like getting Amazon 
to send a box of raw meat to your 
house. Commodities can indeed 
complete tasks and fulfill needs, 
but, in more abstract terms, 
they’re also a sort of physical totem 
or relic — what Marx calls a fetish 
— that symbolically embodies the 
social relationships that made it 
necessary for it to exist. 

To clear up what I just said, 

think back to “Hotline Bling.” The 
song obviously isn’t really about 
that one time Drake’s hotline 
blang. It’s really a sexist anthem 
about how he’s mad that his ex got 
over their breakup and moved on 
with her life, so he decides to put 
her back in her place by reminding 

her that they used to make the 
beast with two backs. 

There 
isn’t 
any 
socially 

acceptable way to say that, though, 
so Drake comes up with “I know 
when that hotline blings, that can 
only mean one thing” instead. The 
implicit end of that line (and its 
actual intended message) is “We’re 
gonna do the nasty … Remember? 
You used to call me up so we could 
do the nasty. You might be doing 
fine by yourself now, but not too 
long ago you were dependent on 
me, and, if you think about it, you 
always will be.” But, in practice, 
what Drake has done is create the 
commodity known as “hotline.” 
It’s an object he can use to more 
efficiently emotionally terrorize 
his ex and, at the same time, a 
fetish representing the shitty 
social arrangement in which Drake 
emotionally terrorizes his ex.

Now, the obvious question you 

might be asking yourself is how 
“Hotline Bling” still manages to 
go so dumb in the club when, at 
the end of the day, we’re listening 
to a song where Drizzy partakes 
in some quasi-Chris Brownian 
douchebaggery with essentially no 
remorse. Are we all sexist assholes? 
Are we idiots? Is the 6 God simply 
too powerful to be destroyed?

The answer to those last three 

questions really depends on your 
politics — I’m personally voting a 
depressed yes on all three — but 
Marx can help us out with the first 
one, at least.

The problem we’re dealing with 

here arises out of the fact that, 
although the hotline is a fetish of 
Drake’s sexist douchery, when you 
look at the phone itself, it’s entirely 
impossible to see any of that. This 
is because, when you think about 
it, Drake’s relationship with his ex 
simply doesn’t exist in the same 
way that Drake and his ex or the 
hotline do. It does exist, but only 
in what Marx calls in Capital 
the “mist-enveloped regions of 
the religious world.” In this way, 
Drake’s shitty relationship with 
his ex is a lot like the Christian 
Holy Ghost. It’s there, in theory, 
but if you wanted to point to it, 
what would you point at? 

Really, you could only do the 

same thing I’ve been doing for 
the last 600 words — point at 
the hotline. Or, if we’re talking 
Christian theology, you’d point at 
Jesus. And, let’s face it, Jesus and 
hotlines are both cool. “Hotline 
Bling” is a fantastic song and, since 
we’re being honest, the Passion 
was pretty damn lit, too. Shouts 
out to the 6 God and God Classic™ 
for the primo content. 

But here, I think, we can 

finally figure out why we don’t 
start throwing up every time 
“Hotline Bling” comes on. It’s 
because we’ll sign on to be a part of 
basically any terribly destructive 
social arrangement whatsoever 
— like the ones where we dance 
around like idiots doing a half-
assed merengue so that Drake 
can terrorize his ex-girlfriend, 
or where we toss all of our weed 
money into a collection hat so 
that a bunch of priests can molest 
kids and tell us not to masturbate 
— provided that we’re not paying 
attention 
(which 
we 
usually 

aren’t) and that the assholes who 
are selling it to us put it in a fancy 
Hotline Jesus case first.

Now, if we were just talking 

about 
“Hotline 
Bling,” 
this 

column wouldn’t need to get all 
that heavy. But, as I mentioned 
earlier, we aren’t just talking 
about “Hotline Bling.” We’re 
talking about hip hop, and about 

why Kendrick Lamar is playing 
to empty arenas while Drake is 
trying on his next set of really 
big rings. We’re talking, in other 
words, about the soul of hip hop. 
So we’re gonna get heavy. 

2015 
has 
been, 
without 

question, one of the biggest years 
in the history of hip hop. Just about 
every major hip-hop center in the 
United States is producing artists 
like Kendrick Lamar, Chance the 
Rapper, Danny Brown, Babeo 
Baggins, Flying Lotus, J. Cole, 
Milo, Young Thug, Future and 
Drake who are radically reshaping 
the music of their cities, inventing 
new 
artistic 
vocabularies 
for 

their unique identities and social 
milieus, and producing albums 
that, I’m convinced, will be 
considered classics 10 or 15 years 
down the line. 

This is also one of those 

rare 
moments 
where 
social 

discontent and creative genius 
have peaked at roughly the same 
time, reaching the point where a 
particularly masterful piece of art 
could, perhaps, inspire the sort of 
activistic fervor that needs to exist 
for political change to become a 
legitimate possibility. 

Police 
violence 
and 
Black 

marginalization — the precise 
issues 
hip 
hop 
is 
designed 

to address — have come to 
the forefront of our political 
consciousness at the exact moment 
when the United States’ first Black 
president is reaching the end of his 
time in office and a candidate like 
Bernie Sanders, who understands 
the link between institutionalized 
racism 
and 
institutionalized 

economic 
disparity, 
actually 

stands a chance at getting into the 
White House and doing something 
to address those problems.

The conditions are perfect and, 

you know, we already have To 
Pimp a Butterfly, gotdamnit. There 
already exists, in the real world, an 
album that addresses all of these 
issues, complete with campaign 
slogans and an incredibly coherent 
social platform to go along with 
them. Literally all you need to do is 
go outside, throw that Kendrick on 
your speakers and start marching.

But, instead, here I am writing 

2,000+ words explaining why you 
couldn’t give less of a shit about 
how “Hotline Bling” is just a well-
polished sexist turd, and here you 
are reading them, presumably 
getting distracted by the Drake 
Google Alert flashing onto your 
iPhone screen every 30 seconds. 
Yes, he’s inventing Canadian hip 
hop right now, but, like, for real? 
You really listened to “Hotline 
Bling” on Spotify 120 million 
times? What the fuck is wrong 
with you?

And, just to bring everything 

full circle, if you were wondering 
why Drake is on top of the game 
right now, it’s for the same reason 
that you can’t stop listening 
“Hotline Bling,” no matter how 
offensive you find it’s political 
content. Just look back down 
at the logo on your phone. You 
remember how the video dropped 
on Apple Music? Do you perhaps 
find it strange that Apple — the 
company that makes the fucking 
iPhone, you know, the one that 
has become so essential to your 
self-concept that being away from 
it for more than five minutes gives 
you separation anxiety — decided 
to sign an exclusive licensing 
deal with the guy whose entire 
discography is a low-key shrine to 
his cell phone?

Do you remember the part in 

“Dune” where Baron Harkonnen 
says “He who controls the spice, 
controls the universe”? Well, we 
live in America, and instead of 
spice we have iPhones.

“Hotline Bling” is an iPhone 

commercial.

Breakdown: Michigan at Minnesota

By JAKE LOURIM

 Managing Sports Editor

The game against Northwestern 

had shades of it, and the game 
against Michigan State did, too. 
But the Michigan football team’s 
game Saturday at Minnesota will 
have old-fashioned power football 
written all over it.

The Wolverines and Golden 

Gophers match run-first offenses 
and 
hard-nosed 
defenses 

Saturday at TCF Bank Stadium 
in 
Minneapolis. 
Minnesota 

cruised in last year’s meeting at 
Michigan Stadium, 30-14, but 
Michigan won six straight in the 
series before that.

The Wolverines have a good 

chance to win this one, too, if 
they can limit mistakes in a tough 
road environment. The Golden 
Gophers have been decimated 
by injuries this season but could 
play their best game Saturday in 
the spotlight.

Here’s how the teams match up:

Michigan 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Minnesota pass defense

Fifth-year senior quarterback 

Jake Rudock is averaging just 
186.1 yards per game passing 
this season, and he failed to 
meet that mark in his last game 
against Michigan State. He did, 
however, establish a big-play 
component, throwing four of his 
15 completions for more than 
20 yards. Just as impressively, 
he threw them to four different 
receivers: 
senior 
tight 
end 

A.J. Williams, redshirt junior 
wide receivers Amara Darboh 
and Jehu Chesson and the 
Wolverines’ 
newest 
offensive 

weapon, 
redshirt 
freshman 

safety Jabrill Peppers.

In all, Rudock has thrown this 

year to 21 different receivers, 
including himself (he caught a 
deflected pass against Michigan 
State). The deep passing game 

still needs work, but Rudock will 
need to focus on taking care of the 
football above all else Saturday.

The Golden Gophers have been 

average at forcing interceptions 
(six total) this year, and their 
pass rush has been weak (tied 
for 103rd in the nation). Their 
pass defense has been stingy, 
though, 
allowing 
just 
177.3 

yards per game. Defensive back 
Jalen Myrick leads Minnesota 
with three interceptions, and 
Adekunle 
Ayinde 
and 
Eric 

Murray have added four pass 
breakups each.

Edge: Minnesota

Michigan rush offense vs. 
Minnesota rush defense

The Wolverines managed just 

83 yards on 28 carries last season 
against Minnesota, but their 
offensive line has been much 
more successful this year. A big 
reason for that is continuity: 
Michigan has started the same 
linemen at the same positions 
in every game this season, and 
many of them have previous 
starting experience.

Junior running back De’Veon 

Smith leads the team with 436 
yards, and he figures to get more 
than the nine touches he had in 
last year’s meeting. After missing 
one game and being limited in 
another, he returned to being the 
featured back against Michigan 
State, earning 19 carries while no 
one else had more than three.

Minnesota 
ranks 
52nd 

nationally 
against 
the 
run, 

giving up 151.4 yards per game, 
so the Wolverines could find 
daylight on the ground. The 
defensive line has been one of the 
Golden Gophers’ healthiest units 
this season, however. Defensive 
linemen Steven Richardson and 
Theiren Cockran have combined 
for 12 tackles for loss and will 
look to create havoc in the 

Michigan backfield as they did 
last season.

Edge: Michigan

Minnesota pass offense vs. 
Michigan pass defense

Like Michigan, Minnesota’s 

passing game is its second option. 
Quarterback Mitch Leidner has 
seven fewer yards than Rudock 
through seven games. He, too, has 
six interceptions, but also seven 
touchdowns. And the Gophers’ 
passing attack is conservative like 
Michigan’s, with a season-long 
play of 38 yards.

Michigan 
secondary 
coach 

Greg Jackson touted the play of 
Minnesota wide receivers KJ 
Maye and Eric Carter, and the 
Gophers also rely heavily on 
tight end Drew Wolitarsky.

The Wolverines allowed a 

season-high 328 passing yards 
against 
Michigan 
State, 
but 

it took a strong effort from 
Spartans quarterback Connor 
Cook, and they won’t face a 
receiver like Michigan State’s 
Aaron Burbridge this week. If 
they can limit the deep ball as 
they have all season, they won’t 
have any trouble.

Edge: Michigan

Minnesota rush offense vs. 
Michigan rush defense

The Gophers’ bread and butter 

is their power running game, 
but they haven’t been able to 
establish it as they did last year, 
when running back David Cobb 
steamrolled the Wolverines for 
183 yards on 32 carries. Cobb 
graduated, 
and 
Minnesota 

hasn’t 
been 
able 
to 
replace 

him with another workhorse. 
Running backs Rodney Smith 
(467 yards, one touchdown) and 
Shannon Brooks (316 yards, three 
touchdowns) have shared the load.

Part of the issue for the 

Gophers is also their health, or 
lack thereof, on the offensive line. 
While Michigan has maintained 
a consistent group, eight different 
players have started on the line 
for Minnesota, and the Gophers 
have used five combinations of 
starters in seven games.

Minnesota 
will 
need 
to 

establish some continuity to 
brace for Michigan’s defense. 
Sixteen 
different 
Wolverines 

have teamed up for 55 tackles 
for loss, led by redshirt junior 
defensive end Willie Henry’s nine 
and redshirt junior defensive 
tackle Chris Wormley’s eight. If 
Michigan comes out angry after 
a heartbreaking loss to Michigan 
State, the Gophers will have 
their hands full.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Finally, the Wolverines can 

confidently say their special 

teams are a strength. Senior 
kicker Kenny Allen is now 
10-for-12 on field goals, and 
fifth-year senior punter Blake 
O’Neill’s 80-yard bomb against 
Michigan State has been the 
highlight of a strong season for 
the Australian punter. In the 
return game, Peppers continues 
to be a weapon.

The Gophers have similar 

numbers. Ryan Santoso is 10-for-
13 on field goals, and Peter 
Mortell is averaging 44 yards per 
punt with only one touchback on 
the season.

Edge: Push

Intangibles

This is the toughest category to 

judge this week. Both teams are 
at difficult points in their seasons. 
Michigan must recover from a 
last-second loss to Michigan State 
and prove its Big Ten title hopes 
aren’t dead yet. The Wolverines 
must also manage the atmosphere 

on the road, where they have 
played just two times this year, 
one of which was a fairly pro-
Michigan crowd at Maryland.

Minnesota, meanwhile, will 

play without head coach Jerry 
Kill, who retired Wednesday 
amid health concerns. Defensive 
coordinator Tracy Claeys will 
lead the team Saturday night, so 
the Gophers, too, could respond 
in one of two ways. They could 
play an inspired game in honor 
of their highly respected coach 
and pull off an upset to put 
their season back on track, or 
they 
could 
be 
disorganized 

and struggle to hold off the 
Wolverines.

Coming off bye weeks, both 

teams should respond well from 
their setbacks. But Minnesota 
should be fired up to win one for 
Kill under the lights on its home 
turf.

Edge: Minnesota

‘M’ heads into Big 
Ten Tournament

By SYED FAHD AHSAN

Daily Sports Writer

With 34 minutes on the clock 

in the Michigan women’s soccer 
team’s Oct. 8 contest against 
Northwestern, Michigan senior 
midfielder 
Corinne 
Harris 
rocketed 
a 

shot into the 
back of the 
net from 25 
yards out. It 
proved to be 
the 
decisive 

moment in a 
1-0 
victory 

for 
the 

Wolverines.

The score line could have 

been worse for the Wildcats 
(7-3-1 Big Ten, 13-4-2 overall), 
who were lucky to have finished 
the 90 minutes only a goal down, 
as Michigan failed to convert 
many of the chances it created.

Now the two are set to lock 

horns once again in the Big 
Ten Tournament quarterfinals 
this Sunday in Wilmette. The 
Wolverines (6-3-2 Big Ten, 11-6-
2 overall) will be looking to pull 
off a performance much like the 
one they gave in October. 

“If we play the way we did 

last game, we should be fine,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Greg 

Ryan. “We’ve been organized 
defensively for most of the year, 
and if we can do that again, we’ll 
been successful. We just need to 
take our chances.”

However, 
since 
that 
loss 

in Ann Arbor, Northwestern 
has won four out of its last 
five games, scoring nine goals 
and conceding just two in the 
process. Michigan, on the other 
hand, hasn’t been nearly as 
stellar in that stretch, with a 
2-2-1 record.

The Wolverines’ last game 

was their 3-1 loss to No. 10 
Penn State, a game defined 
by a seven-minute onslaught 
that saw Michigan sophomore 
goalkeeper Megan Hinz pick the 

ball out of her net three times. 
Senior midfielder Cassie Collins 
grabbed a late consolation goal, 
but it was a case of too little, too 
late for the Wolverines.

“The (Penn State) game will 

be extra motivation to maintain 
focus and discipline,” Ryan 
said. “We played well in the 
beginning, but it was just that 
seven-minute 
collapse 
that 

defined the game, and we paid 
for it.”

The 
Wolverines 
finished 

the regular season fifth in the 
Big Ten standings, but the 
Wildcats were able to finish one 
spot higher given their recent 
success. That’s concerning news 
for Michigan, as its home record 
tells a completely different story 
from its away record.

With only one loss at home 

all 
season, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

dominance in Ann Arbor is 
apparent. But a 1-5-2 record on 
the road shows just how much 
they struggle when not playing 
on familiar ground.

Michigan started this season 

playing 
a 
4-3-3 
formation 

that utilized its wingers and 
fullbacks 
to 
spread 
play, 

widening the field and creating 
space in the middle. For the 
most part, this has remained the 
trademark of the Wolverines’ 
style this season.

Michigan will rely on its 

star forwards, sophomores Ani 
Sarkisian and Taylor Timko, 
who have scored seven goals 
each. They will need to be sharp, 
considering that Northwestern 
has only allowed 10 goals this 
season.

In what looks to be an 

extremely well-matched game 
in the Big Ten Tournament 
quarterfinals, the importance 
isn’t lost on the Wolverines.

“At this point, we’re just 

looking for a chance to move 
on in the Big Ten Tournament,” 
Ryan said.

“It’s 
a 
must-win 
game, 

especially if we want to move 
onto the NCAA Tournament. 
It’ll definitely be a battle.”

Behind Enemy Lines: Mitch Leidner

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

While 
much 
of 
the 
talk 

leading up to the No. 15 Michigan 
football team’s trip to Minnesota 
surrounds 
the 
head 

coaches 
(Michigan 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh 
and recently 
retired Minnesota coach Jerry 
Kill), the players will still have the 
biggest impact on the game. Among 
those players is Golden Gophers 
quarterback Mitch Leidner, who 
is playing the best football of his 
career with 1,310 passing yards 
and seven touchdowns as a junior.

As a quarterback in a run-first 

offense for a football team in a 
hockey-first state, Leidner often 
gets overlooked, but not here. 
Leidner spoke with the Daily 
about building momentum as a 
program, alcohol at stadiums, 
bonding with the team in the wild 
and getting rid of social media.

The 
Michigan 
Daily: 

Michigan had a down year last 
year, but was it still big to get 
the win and the Jug at Michigan 
Stadium?

Mitch 
Leidner: 
It 
was 

huge. It was huge for the state 

of Minnesota, it was huge for 
recruiting and huge for our 
football team. Coming back from 
a game like Michigan, we were so 
excited — the adrenaline took us 
all the way back to our complex. 
We had a bunch of Minnesota 
fans lined up to greet us. It was an 
unbelievable feeling.

TMD: Why don’t you have 

social media?

ML: I had a Twitter last 

summer. I got one and had it up 
until like three games into the 
season when finally — I wasn’t 
using it at all three games into the 
season and a lot of people were 
talking trash so I was like, “What 
is this? C’mon!” So I just deleted 
it. And then I had had Facebook 
since high school, and before our 
bowl game I was just like, “You 
know, I’m just going to be done 
with social media.” And I deleted 
that too. I don’t know, life’s been 
pretty good since. I haven’t had 
to waste any time. I get all my 
homework done since I’m not 
scrolling through my Facebook 
feed. Unfortunately, you guys (the 
media) don’t have a choice.

TMD: After a couple strong 

seasons, it seems your team is 
gaining popularity among fans 
again. How have things changed 
with the wins?

ML: It’s been awesome. When 

I first got to campus, people 
didn’t like the football players too 
much, to be honest with you. It 
wasn’t that much of a thing. It was 
hockey, basketball. Football, it 
was just like “Eh, you guys suck.” 
So basically, we start winning 
some games, and to have people 
in class, teachers, professors be 
excited about your games and 
other students, it’s a really cool 
feeling. It’s something I hadn’t 
really experienced since high 
school, to be honest.

TMD: 
To 
go 
with 
that 

momentum, Minnesota got its 
own stadium close to campus and, 
after some debate, decided to sell 
alcohol at the stadium this year. 
You won’t benefit from it, but did 
they make the right call?

ML: Yeah. People are usually 

in the parking lot getting pretty 
ripped up anyway, but I think 
it’s a great thing to serve it at the 
stadiums, because I think it gets 
your fanbase a little more crazy 
and gets ‘em louder, so I’m all for 
that, especially at home games. 
That’s too bad that the rest of the 
teams aren’t doing that.

TMD: Do you feel like your 

team has to battle the hockey 
team for prominence on campus? 
Hockey is pretty big in Minnesota.

ML: I think the hockey team not 

winning a national championship 

last year kind of helped us out a 
little bit. We were playing on Jan. 
1, and because those guys didn’t 
win the national championship, 
it felt like people got a lot more 
excited about us and football 
was bigger than hockey for a bit. 
But you never really know. It’s 
a hockey state, that’s the way it 
goes. I like playing a little pond 
hockey myself here and there. 
But we all get along. It’s not like 
there’s any tension or bitterness 
between the sports.

TMD: 
Minnesota 
has 
a 

different culture than the coasts 
or the South where a lot of 
Minnesota’s players come from. 
Do they have to adjust to the 
culture at all?

ML: 
It 
was 
funny. 
Josh 

Campion, our right guard, he 
lives up in Fergus Falls, which 
is in northern Minnesota, and 
we brought quite a few guys up 
there back in late June, and it 
was just fun seeing all the guys 
floating down the river and stuff 
like that, and to see KJ (Maye, 
the team’s leading receiver) up 
there exploring nature and having 
a good time. We had a lot of fun. 
Guys like to get out and go to 
the lakes. That’s a big thing to 
do in Minnesota in the summer 
time, and I think guys have been 
enjoying it.

FOOTBALL

BEHIND
ENEMY
LINES

coach Tracy Claeys.

“I think that’s probably very 

indicative of who (Kill) is, and 
maybe the best credit to him is 
they would play like their hair’s 
on fire regardless,” said Michigan 
tight ends coach Jay Harbaugh. “I 
think that says a lot about who he 
is and how he coaches. You’re not 
going to show up and see a differ-
ent team. I think that’s how he 
would want it, too, and that’s how 
those guys play.”

The Golden Gophers run a fairly 

balanced offense in which they 
rush slightly more than they pass. 
Running back Rodney Smith is the 
primary ball carrier, and he has 
earned a solid 4.1 yards per carry 

so far this season, totaling 487. 
Outside of Smith, change-of-pace 
back Shannon Brooks has cranked 
out 321 yards on just 45 carries.

But the player to watch for 

Minnesota is quarterback Mitch 
Leidner. Leidner is on pace for 
a career year with 1,310 passing 
yards through seven games. Of 
course, racking up yards against 
the Michigan defense has proven 
a near-impossible task all season 
long for opponents.

Of the seven quarterbacks 

Michigan has faced, just two — 
Utah’s Travis Wilson and Michi-
gan State’s Connor Cook — have 
eclipsed 200 yards passing. And 
with the Wolverines coming off 
a devastating loss on the final 
play against Michigan State, the 
Golden Gophers’ offense is in the 
unenviable position of getting the 

next crack at them.

“I feel bad for Minnesota,” said 

senior defensive end Royce Jen-
kins-Stone on Monday. “We’re 
going to be coming out with a lot 
of energy now.”

Even after giving up 27 points 

and 386 yards to the Spartans, 
the Wolverines boast the nation’s 
No. 1 scoring defense and the 
No. 1 total defense. Anchored by 
a stout, veteran line, Michigan 
has wreaked havoc in opponents’ 
backfields all season. Leidner 
can expect to be forced out of the 
pocket early and often, at which 
point he’ll be tasked with finding 
receivers blanketed by one of the 
Big Ten’s top secondaries.

On the other side of the ball, 

things are a little less certain for 
the Wolverines. De’Veon Smith 
will get his carries against a Min-

nesota defense that ranks in the 
middle of the Big Ten in rush 
defense, but he has proven to be 
a boom-or-bust back so far this 
season.

While Smith has gone over 120 

yards twice this year, he has also 
been held under 60 yards four 
times, including each of the last 
two games. But Smith’s bruis-
ing style remains a threat, and 
it can be bolstered by contribu-
tions from senior fullback Sione 
Houma and redshirt junior run-
ning back Drake Johnson.

Still, this contest will be heav-

ily influenced by the way each 
team harnesses its emotions. 
And while Michigan is favored 
by two touchdowns, the unpre-
dictable reactions to those emo-
tions could swing the contest in 
either direction.

What to Watch 
For: Minnesota

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

The No. 15 Michigan football 

team has had an extra week 
off since a last-second loss to 
Michigan State two weeks ago. 
While the Wolverines won’t get 
to erase that loss this weekend, 
they can exact revenge from 
another defeat from last season.

Michigan 
will 
travel 
to 

Minnesota, where it will play 
the Golden Gophers on Saturday 
night. Minnesota won the Little 
Brown Jug in crushing fashion 
last 
season, 
defeating 
the 

Wolverines in Ann Arbor, 30-14. 
This year’s game will be a chance 
to remedy the situation and bring 
the trophy back to Schembechler 
Hall. Michigan had defeated the 
Golden Gophers in six straight 
contests prior to last year’s game.

Here’s what to watch for 

Saturday.

1. How will both teams start?

There will be no lack of 

emotion in Saturday’s game. 
Michigan will be playing for the 
first time since its heartbreaking 
loss against Michigan State, in 
which a fumbled punt turned 
into disaster on the game’s final 
play. 
Minnesota, 
meanwhile, 

will be playing its first game 
without coach Jerry Kill, who 
retired Wednesday because of 
health problems.

The Wolverines have insisted 

all week that they will come out 
ready to play, motivated instead 
of defeated. But this team hasn’t 
yet had to face a great deal of 
adversity 
this 
season. 
Sure, 

Michigan lost its season opener 
at Utah, but that was no shock. 
This will be a different test 
altogether. The Wolverines have 
said that they will not let one 
loss turn into two, but Saturday’s 
game will be their chance to 
prove it.

From afar, it seems as though 

the Golden Gophers took Kill’s 
retirement hard. Players took 
to social media to wish him 
well and express how much Kill 
meant to them. While Michigan 
tight ends coach Jay Harbaugh 
said this week that he thinks 
Kill always had his team so fired 
up that it couldn’t possibly play 
any harder, it will be interesting 
to see if Minnesota comes out 
playing inspired in honor of its 
former coach.

2. Will Jabrill Peppers play 
more offense?

The redshirt freshman safety 

made a couple of appearances 
on offense against the Spartans. 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said Peppers could very well play 
offense in the future, but exactly 
how much remains to be seen.

When he went in on offense, 

Peppers had an immediate effect 
against Michigan State. Spartan 
coach Mark Dantonio called 
back-to-back timeouts the first 
time Peppers appeared with 
the offense, an indication that 
Peppers presented an immediate 
concern to the seasoned coach. In 
limited offensive action, Peppers 
finished with two receptions for 
35 yards.

It will be interesting to see 

how Harbaugh deploys Peppers 
on offense going forward. Is he 
a weapon to be used only against 
the toughest opponents, or is he 
going to become a regular part 
of the offense now that he has 
had more than half a season to 
settle in on defense? Jackson said 
this week that Peppers playing 
offense likely had to do with 
both of those factors. No matter 
the situation, Peppers playing 
more offense would certainly be 
a way to mix things up. 

3. How will Blake O’Neill 
respond?

The fifth-year senior punter 

has shown nothing but grace 
ever 
since 
his 
game-ending 

gaffe that filled sports highlight 
shows. He spoke to the media 
last week, emphasizing that one 
mistake will not define him.

But now comes the next 

part of the equation: actually 
kicking. While the Wolverines 
have expressed no doubts about 
their confidence in O’Neill going 
forward, it will ease the minds 
of fans to see him back in his old 
form, pinning opponents inside 
the 10-yard line.

4. Can Michigan’s defense 
return to its dominant ways?

Before 
the 
Wolverines’ 

defense surrendered 21 points 
against Michigan State — with 
the Spartans’ last touchdown 
coming on special teams — the 
unit had recorded three straight 
shutouts. 
Michigan’s 
defense 

had been suffocating until it 
faced the task of shutting down 
an experienced Michigan State 
offense, but even then, the 
Wolverines held their own.

This 
week 
will 
be 
an 

opportunity 
for 
Michigan’s 

defense 
to 
return 
to 
its 

dominance. The Golden Gophers 
have 
experienced 
mixed 

results offensively this season. 
Minnesota 
scored 
41 
points 

against Purdue on Oct. 10 but 
could not muster a score against 
Northwestern the week before.

The 
Wolverines’ 
defense 

should 
come 
out 
fired 
up, 

particularly senior linebacker 
Joe Bolden, who was ejected 
from the game against the 
Spartans for targeting. A fourth 
shutout of the season, especially 
after last week’s loss, would be 
quite an impressive feat.

‘M’ to host Robert Morris

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

New York was kind to the 

Michigan 
hockey 
team 

last 
weekend, 

as 
the 

Wolverines 
tied 
then-

No. 18 Union 
and 
defeated 

Rensselaer 
to 

preserve their 
undefeated 
record.

Now, 
No. 

10 
Michigan 

(3-0-1) 
will 

defend 
its 

home ice and 
untarnished 
resume 
against 

Robert Morris in a two-game 
series on Friday and Saturday.

And while the Colonials (2-0-

2) are unranked, the Wolverines 
do not intend to take them lightly.

“We’re preparing for a good 

team,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “Their power play 
looks to be much better than 
ours — and their penalty killing. 
Their numbers are better than 
our numbers, really.

That respect is warranted 

for a Robert Morris squad that 
boasts 24 goals in just five games.

Most notably, the Wolverines 

will need to contain forward 
Greg Gibson, who is headlining 
the 
high-powered 
offense 

coming off a five-goal weekend 
against Niagara. This could be a 
daunting task given Michigan’s 
defensive 
inconsistency 
(14 

goals in four games) as of late. 
Gibson also finished plus-three 
on the weekend.

More 
than 
anything, 
the 

Wolverines are trying to learn 
from their mistakes and turn 
last weekend’s shortcomings into 
this weekend’s edge.

“We want to be stingier,” 

Berenson said. “We can’t be a 
team that gives up four or five 
goals against and expects to win 
a game, so goals against (needs 
to improve), our power play has 
to be more productive, and our 
penalty killing has to be tighter.”

On the offensive side of the 

puck, senior forward Tyler Motte 
and 
freshman 
forward 
Kyle 

Connor leads the team with four 
and three goals, respectively, but 
they head a balanced attack. Four 
players are tied at two goals apiece, 
and Michigan will likely lean on 
its surprising support coming 
from the third line. Sophomore 
forward Tony Calderone and 

freshman 
forwards 
Brendan 

Warren and Cooper Marody have 
combined for six goals and five 
assists this season.

In terms of injuries, senior 

forward Boo Nieves will be out 
with an upper-body injury, and 
junior defenseman Kevin Lohan 
will be sidelined as well.

As Michigan hosts its second 

homestand of the season, the 
Wolverines will try to send a 
message to opposing teams that 
no performance is good enough to 
steal victories in Yost Ice Arena.

“We want to get off to a good 

start,” Berenson said. “I can’t 
say we did that last Friday when 
we played at Union. Even on the 
Friday before that, I don’t think 
we won the first period. We want 
to be a team that comes out of the 
gate fast and sharp at home and 
sets the tone for the game.”
