When administrators and
architects began planning
the new C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital and Von Voigtlander
Women's Hospital, they turned
to their staff to help make the
facility a place where they
couldn't wait to come to work
each day.
The $754 million, five-year
project is a product of the ideas
and needs of the hundreds of
faculty,staff,doctorsand nurses
who were consulted about the
new hospital, which is expected
to open Dec. 4.
In an interview last month,
the hospital's Executive Direc-
tor Pat Warner said hospital
officials asked staff members
to suggest any improvement
they could think of, regardless
of scale.

"When you brainstorm, you
want people to give you every
idea that pops into their head,"
Warner said. "Then you sort
through them andsee if it's fea-
sible from an operational design
standpoint."
CONSOLIDATING
DEPARTMENT SPACES
One staff member suggested
the regrouping of facilities. In
the past, many departments
were split into various wings
and floors. In the new children's
hospital, the departments are
grouped together in one.area
with the intention of improving
communication and streamlin-
ing processes.
Currently located on the
eighth floor of the inpatient
building in Mott, the Patient
and Family Center Care Pro-
gram is moving to the second
floor. Additionally, the offices of
the Patient and Family Center
Care staff, many of which are
currently across the street from
the hospital in the Medical Pro-
fessional Building, will be relo-
cated to an office in the family

Dingell told a crowd under the
bridge that obtaining funding for
the project was a collaborative
effort between city, state and

federal officials. '
"It wasn't one of us that did it,"
Dingell said. "We did it, all of us'
working together."
Dingell pointed out that the
deteriorating bridges posed a
serious public safety risk and
said he personally tries to avoid
traveling on the structure. He
added that it is important that
damaged bridges around the
country are fixed because they
facilitate regional commerce.

Chemistry Prof. Mark Mey-

construct a sensor to measure
glucose levels in tears. The
device, which was tested on 12
rabbits, is a narrow capillary
tube of glass constructed to
collect tears "without perturb-
ing the eye itself," Meyerhoff
said. This is crucial because
irritating the eye would lead

to inaccurate glucose measure-
ments, he said.
Meyerhoff explained that
researchers have been experi-
menting with the use of tears
as a substitute for blood in dia-

Bomb threats reported at Stockwell

20 years ago this
week (Nov. 19, 1991):
Two bomb threats were
reported in Stockwell
Residence Hall to the
University Department
of Safety and Security on
Nov. 18 and 19.
Though the bomb
threats were false
alarms, Stockwell resi-
dents, like Aileen Supe-
ina, told The Michigan
Daily that the incident in
the hall left them scared
and confused.
"I was scared because
I didn't know what to
expect. Was it a rumor?
Was it the truth? Why
were we the only ones

out there?" Supefia said
at the time.
Residents also com-
plained that they were
unaware of the bomb
threat policy and were
generally dissatisfied
with the way DPSS han-
dled the situation.
30 years ago this
week(Nov. 24, 1981):
Leo Kelly, a former Uni-
versity student accused
of killing two Univer-
sity students in Burs-
ley Residence Hall, was
scheduled to stand trial
beginning Feb. 16.
Kelly's defense attor-
ney, William Waterman,
filed a change of venue

motion to move the
trial out of Washtenaw
County on the grounds
that his client would
not receive a fair trial
because of unfair public-
ity.
Washtenaw County
Circuit Court Judge
Ross Campbell presided
over trial proceedings.
Kelly was ultimately
sentenced to life in pris-
on.
40 years ago this
week (Nov. 23, 1971):
Though the buildingwas
not completed, faculty
members began to move
into the new Modern
Languages Building on

East Washington Street.
The first occupants
of the building were
faculty from the Slavic,
Romance and Germanic
language departments
and the History Depart-
ment.
Albert Khan Associ-
ates, a Detroit architec-
tural firm, constructed
the MLB, making it the
third campus building
the company designed.
The others were Hill
Auditorium, which was
built in 1914, and the
Burton Tower - con-
structed in 1936.

our infrastructure to quite frank-
ly get in serious danger," Dingell
said.
While some members of Con-
gress have argued that the Amer-
ican Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 has not boosted the
nation's economy, Dingell said
the money it provided to the
East Stadium Bridges Improve-
ment Project will be essential
to improve the economy of the
area. The project is estimated to
add 448 jobs, according to Ding-
ell.
"The ARRA and the recovery
legislation has worked," Dingell
said in an interview after the cer-
emony. "And it's goingto do more
to see to it that we have jobs and
opportunity."
MDOT Director Kirk Steudle
said he is pleased the bridge
improvements will include extra
width for sidewalks and bike
paths. Those components will be
important when the 2012 college
football season begins, he said.
Steudle echoed Dingell's
remarks and said bridges and
highways make up the "back-
bone" of the Michigan and U.S.
economies.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje
said several bridges throughout
the country have been shut down
because there was not sufficient
funding for repairs, and the city
has been fortunate to receive
funding to repair its structures.
In an interview after the

ceremony, Hieftje said 48,000
vehicles travel over the Stadium
Bridges every day. Though some
question the bridges' safety,
Hieftje said engineers inspect it
weekly.
"We are sure it's in good con-
dition, but it's certainly time to
bring it down," Hieftje said.
HUD ANNOUNCES
FUNDING FOR COUNTY
At an event at the Washtenaw
County Service Center on Washt-
enaw Ave. yesterday afternoon,
administrators from Washtenaw
County and HUD announced a
$3 million grant for Washtenaw
County as part of HUD's Commu-
nity Challenge Grant program.
The Community Challenge
Grant supports regional develop-
ment plans that aim to improve
economic vitality while keeping
sustainability in mind.
In an interview after the event,
HUD Midwest Regional Admin-
istrator Antonio Riley said the
Obama administration has had
more success than other admin-
istrations in connecting sustain-
ability and housing development.
HUD's newly formed Office
of Sustainable Housing and
Communities - a collaboration
between HUD, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Transportation and
the Environmental Protection
Agency - was designed to seek
out areas like Washtenaw County
that are working to strengthen
regional commerce through envi-
ronmentally friendly ways, Riley
said.

He added that the grant is sig-
nificant for University students
because college towns are impor-
tant "economic engines." Riley
said students will be heavily
impacted by the project consider-
ing their housing and transpor-
tation needs, and the University
had a role in the project.
Speaking on behalf of Hief-
tje, who was scheduled to speak
at the event but was unable to
attend, City Council member
Tony Derezinski (D-Ward 2) said
the project will help Ann Arbor
"re-imagine Washtenaw Avenue"
- a major residential and com-
mercial thoroughfare that runs
through much of the city.
Derezinski added that the
grant will be particularly helpful
to the Ann Arbor Transportation
Authority, as residents have com-
plained about the lack of stops
and operating hours of buses
along Washtenaw Avenue. AATA
has already proposed changes to
Route 4 along the road.
In an interview after the event,
Derezinski said the grant secures
future development strategies the
city is hoping to initiate.
"This is the planning grant we
needed to make sure the plans
were in place," Derezinski said.
Ann Arbor's ability to work
with other municipalities like
the city of Ypsilanti, Ypsilanti
Township and Pittsfield Town-
ship allows multiple cities to reap
the benefits of federal dollars and
strengthen much of the county,
Derezinski said.
"We're darngood, but we could
be even better," he said.

of capital improvement funds.
"One percent is not too much
to ask to keep ourselves from
being beige," Tucker said, refer-
ring to the original color of his
coat. He added that the council
wouldn't want him to demon-
strate what zero percent fund-
ing for public art would look
like.
At last night's meeting, City
Council member Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1) formally introduced
amendments she sponsored that
would reduce and refine fund-
ing for public art. The amend-

ments propose to slash public art
funding from 1 percent to half a
percent. Thus, the amendments
would make the name of the pro-
gram, Percent for Public Art, a
misnomer.
The changes would prohibit
capital improvement funds,
which are used for public art,
from being used for sidewalk
repairs or construction. The
amendments would also require
that funds for public art be spent
within three years or risk being
returned to the budget fund
from which they originate.
Briere urged residents to
understand that while many
council members support public
art, they would like to see new

"mechanisms" of funding it.
Council member Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) said the
council needs to send the mes-
sage that the city is dedicated to
basic services before other pro-
grams like public art.
The amendments passed
a first reading last night, and
council will see the amendments
for a second reading at its next
meeting on Dec. 5.
Newly elected council mem-
ber Jane Lumm (I-Ward 2) was
also officially sworn in at last
night's meeting along with re-
elected City Council members
Mike Anglin (D-Ward 5), Mar-
cia Higgins (D-Ward 4), Kunsel-
man and Briere.

Weak economy a
source of discontent
in the swing state
MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP)
- President Barack Obama will
visit a changed New Hampshire
today.
The independent-minded
presidential swing state he won
in 2008 has shifted distinctly to
the right since his last visit nearly
two years ago. The local economy
is struggling to grow and voters
are increasingly unhappy with
the president's leadership.
"He's not getting my vote - no
way," construction worker Nor-
man Berube, a 49-year-old reg-
istered independent, said while
waiting for a booth at the Airport
Diner recently. "This country is
worse off."
Others say the same.
Recent polls show that, if the
election were held today, Obama
would lose byroughly10percent-
age points to Republican presi-
dential candidate Mitt Romney,
the leading contender for the
GOP nomination. That's quite a
slide for an incumbent who beat
Republican Sen. John McCain
here by nearly the same margin

just three years ago.
Still, a year before Obama's re-
election, Democrats aren't pan-
icking.
In fact, Obama's campaign is
quietly confident that he can re-
ignite voters' passion the more
they see him, which explains why
Obama is venturing to Central
High School to promote elements
of his jobs plan that's stalled in a
divided Congress.
His visit comes just as a special
deficit-reduction supercommit-
tee in Washington is on the brink
of failing to reach an agreement
on how to save taxpayers $1.2
trillion over the coming decade.
A fundamental divide over how
much to raise taxes - a salient
issue in low-tax New Hampshire
- was proving too high a hurdle
to overcome.
With finger pointing begin-
ning in Washington, Obama was
heading to New Hampshire,
which his surrogates recently
have showered with attention, as
Republican candidates wielding
anti-Obama messages swarm the
state ahead of the Jan.10 primary.
"There have been a lot of
Republicans up here," said Kathy
Sullivan, a New Hampshire-
based member of the Democratic
National Committee. "It's a good

time for the people of New Hamp-
shire to hear from the president."
Yesterday alone, four of the
eight GOP contenders - Romney,
former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman,
Texas Rep. Ron Paul and former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich -
campaigned in New Hampshire.
Romney, speaking to voters
in Nashua, used Obama's visit to
bash the president anew.
"I'd like to hear what he has
to say," Romney said. "It's very
clear, we're not better off than we
were when he came into office."
Unemployment in the state
was at 5.4 percent in September,
well below the national average
of 9 percent.
Romney is expected today to
begin airing his first TV ads in
New Hampshire to reinforce that
message. And while Obama's job
approval numbers here are weak,
more alarming is polling sug-
gesting that independents - a
key voting bloc in the presiden-
tial race - have swung decidedly
away from Obama after lifting
him to victory in the state and
across the country.
Independent voters helped
Republicans sweep the state's
congressional elections and win
veto-proof majorities in both
chambers of the state legislature.

Teen pleads guilty
in killing of Calif.

A Southern California teen-

gay classmate in a deal that will
send him to prison for 21 years.
Ventura County Chief Deputy
District Attorney Mike Frawley
says the plea deal was reached
yesterday in the case of 17-year-
old Brandon McInerney, who
gunned down 15-year-old Larry
King at a school in Oxnard in Feb-

the time.
The case had been expected to
go to retrial following a Septem-

the degree of guilt. The panel
took a series of votes, the last one
with seven in favor of voluntary
manslaughter and five jurors sup-

MANCHESTER, N.H.
Gingrich requests-
private retirement
accounts for youth
Republican presidential con-
tender Newt Gingrich yesterday
proposed allowing younger work-
ers still decades away from retire-
ment to bypass Social Security and
instead choose private investment
accounts that would be subject to
stock market gyrations.
The former House speaker,
who has risen in the polls, would
allow younger workers to take
their share of the payroll tax that
funds Social Security and put it in
a private account.
Employers would still pay their
share of the tax, which would
be used to pay benefits for cur-
rent retirees. But it would create
a funding shortfall that Gingrich
brushed off.

"That gap is more than covered
by the savings" that would come
from giving states control of 185
social welfare programs, Gin-
grich told reporters after a speech
that laid out broad concepts but
lacked key details.

Kelly Parent, patient-family
coordinator at the family cen-

resources presented a problem
for offering adequate care.
"The main thing I think our
new hospital is going to improve
(is that) our programs are going

According to Parent, inpatient

the new location will allow out-

aspects of the hospital. Dr. John
Charpie, professor of pediatric
cardiology, said this is the first
time cardiac surgeons with the
University Hospital have been
located in the same area as car-
diology testing areas and outpa-
tient clinics.
"This really allows us to func-
tion as a program that can pro-
vide all of the cardiac services
to our patients in one location,"
Charpie said.
Charpie said the new set up
will allow for clinical, education-
al and research collaboration. He
added that it will solve problems
the hospital has had with conti-
nuity of care.
"Thevastmajorityof criticism
by families in the past was about
the physical layout (of the hospi-
tal)," Charpie said. "These issues
have now been removed."
IMPROVING PATIENT AND
CONFERENCE ROOMS
In addition to the layout of
departments, staff members
also gave input regarding the
design of the new patient rooms.
The rooms now contain features
that save time in emergencies
and make routine processes
easier. Parent pointed to newly-
installed oxygen equipment on
each side of patient beds - a
small addition staff members felt
was important.
"This way, you're going to
have quick and easy access to
hooking up a patient to whatev-
er itisthat theyneeinonatter
what side (of them) you are on,"
Parent said.
Charpie said the staff also
suggested patient rooms be
located across from each other
so nurses stationed outside the
rooms could easily monitor mul-
tiple patients simultaneously.
The rooms were originally sup-
posed to be identical and fac-
ing the same way, according to
Charpie.
"The problem with that is that
operationally, it does not allow
a nurse to care for more than
one patient at a time," Charpie
said. "Unfortunately, you don't
have one nurse for one patient
everywhere throughout a hospi-
tal - that's just not a sustainable
staffing model."
Charpie also pointed to new
break-away doors in the inten-
sive care units as additions that
will allow doctors to access
patients more quickly.

Dan Fischer, director of the
hospital's Child and Family Life
Department, said the larger
size of the new patient rooms
makes his job easier. Whereas

He added that it would take
approximately10 to 15 minutes to
collect the necessary amount of

"We recognize that alot more

Meyerhoff and his colleagues

it could also take up to five years
before the technology is avail-
able for consumer use, Meyerhoff
said.
Even if the technology
becomes available for human
use, Meyerhoff emphasized that
the instrument would not replace
blood glucose measurements.

Meyerhoff said. "It will tell you

Rudgers also addressed the
need for multimedia with an
international focus.
"We live in a world, as sad as it
may be, with an often short atten-
tion span," Rudgers said. "So the
ability for us to tell a story quick-
ly and with impact matters. And
today, that often means with ter-
rific visuals, with a great graphic
presentation and with video."
Rudgers stressed that there is
a high demand from University
faculty members and schools for
the News Service to communi-
cate their research to a larger
audience.
"It's clear the demand for us to
tell our stories and for individual
schools and colleges and faculty
members to tell their stories is
just huge," she said.
Rudgers served as the Uni-
versity's vice president for com-
munications from 2000 to 2007.
Last spring, University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman asked
her to return to the position.
Coleman wanted her to address
the tremendous change in the
"scale and scope and demand for
communications globally" since
she last worked at the Univer-
sity.
"In the wintertime of 2007,
there were about 28 million
people on Facebook. Now, last
month, 850 million," Rudgers
said. "The explosion of social
media and our ubiquitous use
of it has really changed the way
people like me do our jobs."
RESOLUTION PASSED TO
EXPAND FACULTY VOTING
Later in the meeting, the Sen-
ate Assembly passed a resolution
aimed at expanding the level of
engagement in faculty gover-
nance by allowing the Faculty
Senate - a group of about 3,000
faculty members including all
professors -to vote on certain
issues determined by the Senate
Assembly. The resolution also
approved the use of an electronic
voting system.

Ed Rothman, a former Senate
Advisory Committee on Univer-
sity Affairs chair and professor of
statistics, said he fully supports
the resolution.
"I'm very much in favor of
this. I think we need to empower
all of the members of the senate
- 3,000 or so of us - to take part
in this process," Rothman said.
"It'll make our jobs more impor-
tant and more visible in a very
positive way."
Rachel Goldman, a SACUA
member and professor of engi-
neering and physics, said she
supports the resolution but sees
the loss of control as a potential
drawback.
"If we adopt electronic voting
for full senate issues, we would
possibly lose a little bit of control
in favor of democracy," Goldman
said.
SACUA member John Lehm-
an, a professor of ecology and
evolutionary biology, said he
believes there could be prob-
lems implementing the resolu-
tion because volunteers would
be needed to organize the online
voting process. Previously they
used paper ballots.
ASSEMBLY PASSES
RESOLUTION CHANGING
CHAIR TERMS
The Senate Assembly passed a
resolution adding on to the exist-
ing term limits for SACUA mem-
bers.
The original policy stated that
there is a one-year limitation for
holding the SACUA chair posi-
tion and a three-year term limit
for SACUA and Senate Assembly
members. With the resolution,
the one-year limitation is extend-
ed to the vice chair and the
three-year limit is extended to
the Senate Secretary, who could
previously serve for one year.
SACUA Vice Chair Kim Kear-
fott, a professor in the Medical
School and College of Engineer-
ing, said she supports the motion
even though it means she will
give up her position next year.
"I am the one person who is
immediately affected by this,
and I think it's a really good idea
because it makes sure there's
a turnover in people and that
people don't get entrenched in
-their- various :postions "'Kear-
fott said.

A STATE-OF-THE-ART
KITCHEN
Staff members' excitement
about the new facility also spans
down to the basement, where
the food-service staff are look-
ing forward to the new kitchen.
According to Diane Knibbs,
associate director of food ser-
vices, the old hospital's cooking
area was never designed to be an
institutional kitchen.
"We couldn't have raw food in
the old kitchen," Knibbs said. "It
had to already be precooked and
chilled down."
Executive Chef Stephen Schi-
fano describes the old kitchen,
which was smaller than the new
building's dry store room, as
crowded and boring.
"There was no creativity,"
Schifano said.
In contrast, staff in the new
facility has room to make food
most people wouldn't expect to
see in a hospital.
The kitchen staff has started
to experiment with different
food items. The new menu fea-
tures options such as Michigan
cherry salad with chicken, ques-
adillas, a sandwich bar, breakfast
wraps and Asian stir-fry dishes.
"We used to have a microwav-
able pizza," Schifano said. "Now
we're making our pizzas from
whether you're high or low, (and
when to) check your blood glu-
cose. (Do not) rely on it to give
yourself insulin."
Meyerhoff said he never
imagined himself as a diabetes
researcher.
"I always swore I would
never work on glucose because
too many people are doing it ..."
he said. "It's such a hot subject,
given the status (of) how many
people have diabetes."
In the United States, 25.8
million people have diabetes,
according to National Institutes
of Health.
In addition to Meyerhoff,
other University researchers will
be focused on diabetes research
with the help of a multimillion
dollar grant received last week.
The Center for Geospatial Medi-
cine at the University's School of
Natural Resources and Environ-
ment received a $6.2 million joint
grant with Duke University from
the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foun-
dation. The grant is part of the
foundation's national diabetes
program, Together on Diabetes,
and the project will be based in
Durham County, N.C.
Unlike Meyerhoff's study, the

Parent said will make the new
hospital an incredible experi-
ence for patients.
"This facility is wonderful
and fantastic," Parent said. "But
still, it's the people who are going
to make the difference for our
patients and our families."
Parent explained that in the
past, drab facilities made the
work environment less upbeat,
especially in internal staffing
rooms, which received no sun-
light.
"They made sure that the staff
rooms have external windows
so people can get the sun thera-
py," she said. "And they can see
what's going on, and it's going to
be really rejuvenating to be able
to see outside."
Small details like these elevate
the staff's morale, Parent said.
"I have to believe that when
you feel happier you're going
to be a happier employee, and
you're going to be better," she
said.
Charpie added that he thinks
the facility is a reflection of what
goes on within its walls.
"We feel that we've been prac-
ticing world-class medicine at a
top institution for a long time,"
Charpie said. "And now, we feel
we have the physical place to
support that contention, and
I think that's a real source of
pride for everyone."
collaboration with Duke Univer-
sity will focus on Type II dia-
betes. The goal of the research
is to examine the relationship
between where diabetes patients
live and the health care available.
With the grant, the research-
ers will use geospatial mapping
- a technology which takes
health care and disease informa-
tion and shapes it to a physical
map of a community-according
to the press release.
Marie Lynn Miranda, direc-
tor of the Center for Geospatial
Medicine, wrote in a University
press release that she is grateful
for the opportunity to investi-
gate the relationship between
disease, health care and location.
Miranda will become the dean of
SNRE on Jan. 1.
Mary Riegle, director of spe-
cial events and individual giving
at the American Diabetes Asso-
ciation office in Detroit, wrote
in an e-mail interview that she
strongly believes research makes
a huge difference in the lives of
diabetics.
"We know so much more
about diabetes than we did 20
years ago because of research,"
Riegle wrote.

leader in energy efficiency.
Wednesday's announcement came after the
Obama administration and automakers agreed
in principle to the plan last July. This is well
over a 50-percent increase since the Energy
Independence and Security Act of2007, which
mandated that the national mileage reach 35.
miles per gallon by 2020.
The average fuel economy standard in the
U.S. has been stuck at 27.5 miles per gallon
since the mid-1980s. The European Union
and countries like Japan have average rates
of at least 45 mpg, starkly contrasting the
Corporate Average Fuel Economy in the U.S.
Though President Barack Obama has yet to
fulfill promises to cut down on foreign energy
dependence and oil consumption, the admin-
istration has begun making strides toward
raising the fuel-efficiency standard.
It's crucial that Congress takes steps to
reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Making
automobiles more fuel efficient would greatly
impactthese efforts. Moreover, the proposal is
in line with additional efforts made by the U.S.
EPA to cut down on motor vehicle emissions,
which is a major contributor to greenhouse
gases. Gas exhaust has undesirable effects on
the environment and public health. Factors
such as toxic hydrocarbons and solid particu-
lates contribute to air pollution A escalating a
varietyof diseases includingsome cancers.
Many foreign car companies including
Daimler AG, BMW AG, Jaguar Land Rover
and Porsche AG choose to violate CAFE
requirements and pay millions of dollars in

fines as a result. Volkswagen AG has been
especially vocal against raising fuel-efficiency
standards, while Ford Motor Company, Chrys-
ler Group and General Motors have come out
in support of the proposal, saying 54.5 mpg is
an achievable goal.
Taxes on gas-guzzling vehicles are proving
ineffective at gaining cooperation from auto-
manufacturers. Companies are happy to pay
the fines for noncompliance because the fees
are less costly than investing in new technolo-
gies. In orderto enforce the new national stan-
dard, the Obama administration should follow
theleadofother EuropeanandAsiancountries.
Different measures need to be implemented
to promote fuel-efficiency - fiscal incentives
could be provided for companies that comply,
and tax relief could be awarded according to
efficiency and lower emission rates.
The U.S. is the world's largest market for
passenger vehicles. Therefore, corporations
have a responsibility to do the best they can
for the environment, economy and health of
their consumers. It's in the country's best
interest to cut down on energy consump-
tion - if the proposed rates do take effect by
the projected date, the country will use 2.2
million fewer barrels of oil each day. CAFE
standards needoto respond to pressuresnof
the present. In a global economy, it's of the
utmost importance that U.S. automakers can
compete with their foreign counterparts in a
market that is becoming increasingly envi-
ronmentally conscious.

international students studying
on campus. During the 2010-2011
academic year, this amounted to
5,995 students coming to the Uni-
versity from around the world. A
2010 statistical report released by
the University of Michigan Inter-
national Center shows that inter-
national student enrollment has
steadily increased each year. This
is reflective of a broader nation-
al trend. According to the IIE's
annual Open Doors report, foreign
student enrollment in the United
States increased by 5 percent over
the past year. To put that in per-
spective, there are 32 percent more
international students studying in
the U.S. today than there were one
decade ago.
These statistics speak for them-
selves. Anyone who still believes
that isolation from the world out-
side U.S. borders is a viable option is
simply delusional. As with econom-
ics and politics, higher education is
yet another venue in which people
from opposite sides of the globe now
interact on a daily basis.
But let's not get lost in the num-
bers or cliche abstractions. Like the
ever-elusive "diversity," it's easier
for us to frame foreign students as
if they were merely a data point or a
homogenous demographic and easi-
er to deem all international students
"non-American" rather than invest
the time to learn what makes their
respective cultures unique from one
another. For American students and
native English speakers, the more
difficult (and urgent) task is to learn
how to communicate with and learn
from the international students

with whom we interact each day.
Their presence should be a constant
reminder that we live in an increas-
ingly global society. Perhaps the
best way to act upon this is learning
another language.
Which brings me to my unfortu-
nate point: The University's foreign
language requirement is inadequate.
In the University's largest school,
LSA, fourth-term proficiency in a
language other than English is nec-
essary for graduation. For students
pursuing concentrations in interna-
tional studies or specific area studies
programs, sixth-term proficiency is
required.
Are four to six courses enough to
ascertain a new language? Unfortu-
nately, I'd have to say no. As in most
schools, basic language courses at
the University consist of hour-long
sessions that meet anywhere from
three to five times each week in a
formal classroom setting. That's not
really the issue. The true problem
lies in the fact that, as soon as stu-
dents step outside the classroom,
they revert back to English. As long
as we still study at the University, we
can't escape the fact that we live in
an English-speakingsociety. English
inevitably interferes with foreign
language acquisition.
For some students, that is perfect-
ly all right. They consider the foreign
language requirement a burden and
a distraction from their concentra-
tion. But for those who genuinely
wish to master a new language, it.
quickly becomes clear that our cur-
rent system of foreign language
instruction isn't conducive to actual
proficiency. Intro courses certainly
provide the necessary foundations
- grammar, vocabulary, cultural
awareness - that are requisite to
long-term language acquisition, but
they fall short of supplying students
with the tools they need in order to
carry on an intelligent conversation
with a native speaker.
The best remedy would of course
be studying abroad. Immersing one-
self in a foreign language and culture
is proven to be the most effective
means of language acquisition and
long-term retention. The University
has exceptional resources for stu-
dents interested in studying abroad,

and I would encourage all to consid-
er this option.
Nonetheless, the University can
still improve things here on campus.
For instance, departments should
offer more semester- or year-long
intensive language courses. Inten-
sive language classes represent the
best available alternative to actual
immersion abroad. Having taken
intensive first-year Russian, I can
attest to the fact that intensive
courses do wonders for language
acquisition.

6

U' should focus
more on foreign
languages.
Students in the Residential Col-
lege are required to complete an
intensive foreign language program,
which allows them to satisfy their
LSA language requirement faster.
With an emphasis on speaking, RC
students also gain superior con-
versational proficiency. Keeping in
mind that students are often wary
of devoting so many credits to one
class, undergraduates should be
encouraged, not steered away, from
pursuing intensive foreign language
coursework.
Foreign languages are tough. We
should recognize this, reward stu-
dents who pursu.e languages beyond
the LSA requirement and reinforce
the fact that foreign language com-
petency makes students more com-
petitive in the job market following
graduation. The University would
do itself a favor by investing in more
intensive foreign language pro-
grams and encouraging all students
to achieve full language proficiency
- something that can't be achieved
at the current low standards. In the
future, when globalization.is old
news and foreign language skills are
valued above all else, we'll be thank-
ful that our University expected the
most of us.

Make crime alerts more descriptive

I write to draw the campus community's
attention to a pair of articles that recently
appeared in the online edition of The Michi-
gan Daily.
"Students talk racial profiling in Depart-
ment of Public Safety alerts" describes a town
hall meeting where students of color gathered
to share their experiences of being randomly
stopped, interrogated and searched by DPS
officers. The town hall meeting was called by
Students of Color of Rackham in response to
an especially problematic alert that described
an alleged offender as a black man who was
either "bald or with dreadlocks" - a vague and
contradictory description that makes it easier
to engage in racial profiling.
DPS Chief Greg O'Dell explained to the
frustrated town hall audience that alerts had
to go out quickly in order to comply with the
Clery Act, and therefore officers don't have
time to procure more detailed descriptions or
reconcile contradictions. In light of this, I was
surprised to see a second article titled "Days
later, DPS alerts East Quad of sexual assault."
This article describes an incident of sexual
assault that was not reported to the cam-
pus until 10 days after the fact because DPS
didn't think the incident represented a serious
threat.
Taken together, these articles expose seri-
ous flaws in the University's crime alert sys-
tem, namely that they exacerbate the problem
of racial profiling and simultaneously mini-
mize the problem of sexual violence. Last
week's town hall organizers presented data
on four years of crime alerts - showing that
more than half of these alerts involved alleged
crimes perpetrated by black men. This figure
is wildly disproportionate to the population of
black men who attend the University or reside
in the larger Ann Arbor community. The cause
of this disproportionate reporting pattern is
not clear, but the effects are undeniable: Stu-
dents of color (especially African-American
men) face racial profiling, which makes them
feel less safe on campus.
If you have never experienced the fear and

shame that comes with being interrogated by
police while you are minding your own busi-
ness in the library, racial profiling might seem
minor compared to the issue of safety. But do
crime alerts ensure safety? When it comes to
sexual violence, these alerts might actually
leave us underprepared.
Last week's unreported East Quad Resi-
dence Hall incident is just one example. It's
likely that more students on campus have
experienced date rape or acquaintance rape
than have been attacked by a stranger in East
Quad, but we never get crime alerts about
those incidents either. On the other hand, we
frequently get crime alerts about stranger-
assaults (and half of these alerts feature black
men). This leads to a situation where many
students feel instinctively fearful when they
see an unfamiliar black man approaching on
the sidewalk, even though chances are this
person is probably just another student on
their way home from a late night study session.
What few students realize is that the pushy
guy who keeps bringing you drinks at a party,
or who implies he is owed sex because he paid
for your meal, is a much more likely source of
violence than the stranger on the street. Crime
alerts give us a false illusion of safety, making
usoverlyfearful insituationsthatare probably
safe and overly complacent in situations where
we might actually be in danger.
The Clery Act and the crime alert system
are certainly well intentioned - buthave rates
of sexual violence (or any other type of vio-
lence) actually decreased as a result of these
policies? All students deserve a safe campus
where they can learn, live, work and play
without being subject to violence. We deserve
initiatives that address root causes of violence
like challenging pervasive rape culture. We
deserve strategies for addressing violence that
don't perpetuate racial profiling, which is a
form of violence itself. If the Clery Act and the
crime alert system don't provide this, it's time
to develop effective alternatives that will.
Jesse Carr is a Rackham student.

On Nov.11, a number of concerned University students,
faculty, administrators, staff and representatives from
the University's Department of Public Safety convened at
the Law School to discuss an issue critical to our current
reality in Ann Arbor: race, racism and safety. What led to
the organization of the town hall meeting was a rather
dubious crime alert which described a black male suspect
as being "bald or with dread locks" and wearing either an
"orange, red or black" sweatshirt.
Now, anyone in their rightmind knowsthat it's impos-
sible to confuse a baldhead with dread locks. This vague
description fits a number of black men who attend the
University, myself included - a black male Ph.D. student
with no criminal record, whose academic merit at the
University of Florida and the University of Wisconsin-
Madison rightfully earned a space here at the University
of Michigan three years ago. These and other similar
alerts lack a specificity that could lead to apprehending
the suspect.
My central concern, however, is that this description
and the medium it was pipelined through - via e-mail
- results in a unique practice of racial profiling that per-
petually typecasts African-American men as pathologi-
cal menaces to Ann Arbor's society. I call this practice
viral racism because, like a virus, these descriptions
spread through the University system and thus pei-
petuate a gendered formation of blackness that's inher-
ently criminal and deviant. This viral racism is a subtle
practice of racial profiling that's legally and federally
protected in the name of campus "safety" vis-a-vis the
Clery Act.
While the town hall meeting and its reception were
positive; students' responses to The Michigan Daily's
coverage of the meeting deserve critical attention. These
comments were accusatory and representative of racial
politics endemic to the University's campus climate -
racial politics that can perhaps explain why students
of color do not feel comfortable at the University. Com-
ments attacked Philosophy Prof. Elizabeth Anderson
with counterproductive personal attack, calling her an
idiot and a moron because she dared to challenge the
need of race as a descriptor in DPS crime alerts. Critics of
Anderson take race for granted as a descriptive category,
unfazed even by vague descriptions as "baldhead or with
dreadlocks." Iam disturbed by the fact that of those who

condemned Anderson, none were willing to acknowledge
this appalling crime alert description.
Indeed, there were a number of comments that failed
to comprehend the history of race and racial profiling
endemic to Ann Arbor and the United States. Critical
to this discussion is the racialization and regulation of
"safety" on campus. What body of students benefit from
safety and at whose expense? This was the question that
town hall participants addressed. DPS crime alerts pro-
vided a platform to discuss privilege and power, as well
as pathology and marginalization.
Let us all be more conscious of the crime alerts. At
the town hall meeting, archival research was presented
of crime alerts, from 2007 to 2011, as opposed to those
reported in the Daily's report and issued by DPS, which
only represented a few short months of data. This method
was done to highlight a politics of disproportion whereby,
according to 2010 U.S. Census data and University demo-
graphics, the total number of black men who attend the
University and those who reside in Ann Arbor was sub-
stantially less than reported percentages in said-crime-
alerts1n 2010,3.28 pecient of men at the University were
black; and the total number of black male residents in
Ann Arbor was less than 7.7 percent. Between November
2007 and October 2011, 62 incidents provided descrip-
tions of the suspect whereby black men represented 48.3
percent of alleged offenders. Men of color (including
Latino, Asian, black and mix raced) comprised 51.5 per-
cent of these descriptions.
What factors explain this disproportionate reporting
pattern?
Instead of attacking town hall organizers and panel-
ists, it's time to institute social and institutional change
here atthe University.
I will close in an attempt to capture the essence of
Anderson's presentation. Anderson's central questions,
cogently articulated throughout her presentation, were:
Why are we so obsessed with race in this country? What
value, or added value, does race have - particularly for
those with access to institutional power compared to
those who do not? She argued that if race is important
and necessary, then we ought to be more diligent and
ethical in the transfer of reportage.

Kick-ass Korean films

I n my last column, I briefly
mentioned some of the
films being made in Korea
during the past few years. Kore-
an filmmakers have been pro-
ducing some
of the best
films in the
world in the
last decade,e
capturing
the atten-
tion of film \<$
festivals and PHILIP
cinephiles CONKLIN
worldwide.
For those
wishing to explore Korean cin-
ema, here is a broad overview of
some of the country's best films
and directors.
The Korean director best
known in the U.S. is Park Chan-
wook, director of The Ven-
geance Trilogy - "Sympathy for
Mr. Vengeance," "Oldboy" and
"Lady Vengeance." "Oldboy,"
probably the most widely seen
Korean film in this country, is
a good place to start in one's
exploration into Korean cinema.
The film tells the story
of a man who is kidnapped
and imprisoned for 15 years
without being told why, and
upon release, he's given five
days to find his captor. Apart
from being a great film in its
own right, the movie is also
emblematic of what has come
to be recognized as the Korean
style - genre filmmaking,
graphic violence, the juxtaposi-
tion of dark humor and intense
pathos and an intricate, stylized
visual sense. While "Oldboy"
is heavier on the violence and
shock factor than most Korean
films, it serves as a barometer
for further exploration of the
country's cinema.
Other notable films by Park
include "J.S.A.: Joint Security
Area," which is about guards on
each side of the Korean border,
and "Thirst," his take on the
vampireamyth. Though,&S.A.' ,
is clunky in parts (there's more 
than a little awkward exposi-
tion and halting, nearly incom-
prehensible English), it's one

football fan his entire life. He was
more than up to the task of mak-
ing the transition to calling the
play-by-play for Michigan home
games, though he was careful to
maintain the tone established by
his predecessors.
"Michigan has always been
fairly conservative (when
announcing home games), and I
think that's the right way to be,"
Grapentine said. "Calls should
be impartial. If there are 110,000
people roaring, my voice might
get higher or louder, but I try to
use the exact same terminol-
ogy when I'm saying 'Michigan
touchdown' or 'Notre Dame
touchdown.' "
He added, "Generally, the PA
announcer doesn't do any fire-up,

It's the way it's always been."
Since the beginning of his
stint as the Big House announc-
er in 2006, the Big House has
undergone numerous structural
changes that have been instru-
mental in retaining crowd noise.
Grapentine says he has noticed a
palpable difference in volume.
"My voice sounded louder as
more and more structure went up
on the east side, and now, there
are completely different speak-
ers this year, too," he said. "The
sound engineer (during the night
of the Notre Dame game) was
telling them to keep it cranked
up as high as it could, and it really
sounded loud."
That night - Michigan's first
home night game in more than
130 years of football - marked a
special moment for Grapentine,
and he could sense that the fans
felt similarly.
"It was just totally electric and
exciting," he said.fJiI' 'emember

Bentley welcomes
Motown PR pioneer

Twi-hards, where art thou?

Al Abrams to
speak at Bentley
book signing today
By JEFF WARANIAK
DailyArts Writer
Famed wordsmith Bob Dylan
was once quoted referring to
up-and-coming Motown singer-
songwriter
Smokey Robin-A
son as "Amer-
ica's greatest With Al
living poet." Aixm
But where and
when Dylan Todayat 3p.m.
actually said Bentley Historical
those words is Library
almost impos-
sible to figure Free
out - because
Dylan never actually said them.
Motown Records's first
employee and National Promo-
tion Director Al Abrams fab-
ricated the famous "greatest
poet" quote as a stunt to gain
attention for Robinson's latest
album.
In his new book, "Hype &
Soul: Behind the Scenes at
Motown," Abrams recounts
these and other clever market-
ing ploys as he tells the story
of Motown's early years. He
describes the genesis of Berry
Gordy, Jr.'s Motown Record Cor-
poration from his own point of
view as the company's first PR
consultant.
Abrams will discuss his book
and his experiences promot-
ing Motown artists like The
Supremes, The Marvelletes,
Marvin Gaye and Smokey Rob-
inson at a book signing at the
University's Bentley Historical
Library today from 3 p.m. to 5
p.m.
Much of the material for

Abrams's book, including his
original press releases, photo-
graphs and personal scrapbook,
are in the Bentley archives
where Abrams first began sub-
mitting his Motown memo-
rabilia in 1998. The Bentley is
committed to documenting the
history of the state of Michigan
- a pursuit Abrams has come to
admire as a contributor to the
library's Motown history col-
lection.
"I wanted my material to be
available to all kinds of schol-
ars and researchers," Abrams
said in an interview with The
Michigan Daily. "Other people
had contacted me (about acquir-
ing documents), such as the
Hard Rock Cafe, but I couldn't
envision some of these great
documents up on a wall in a
restaurant covered in spaghetti
sauce. The Bentley is really the
best place for all of my stuff to
be."
According to Abrams, the job
of a promotional director in the
1960s was much more laborious
than it is now. Abrams said he
envies today's PR personnel in
the music industry, who have
the Internet at their disposal.
He explained the complicated
process album promotion used
to involve, which included the
now-defunct manual type-
writer and the uncertainty of
whether a press release would
make it to its intended recipient
on time.
However difficult the job
may have been, Abrams suc-
ceeded from the start. It was a
combination of boldness, tenac-
ity and a little foolishness that
won Berry Gordy, Jr.'s attention.
When Abrams, a young Jewish
boy from Detroit, first came to
Motown's mostly black record-
ing studio in 1959, Gordy pre-
sented him with the challenge

of getting an unknown artist
named Kenny Powers on the air.
Abrams took Powers's record
directly to a radio station and
persistently asked the DJ to play
it. After refusing Abrams for five
hours, the DJ finally played the
record and, as luck would have
it, Gordy had his car radio tuned
to the station playing Kenny
Powers's song.
Gordy offered Abrams the job
the next day, thinking he must
be "a promotion genius," as
Abrams put it.
Abrams knew it was simply a
lucky break.
"The reason I probably suc-
ceeded in getting records on the
air at first is that I didn't know
what could be done and what
couldn't," Abrams said. "I was
just too naive to know the dif-
ference."
Abrams still enjoys listen-
ing to the music of Motown, but
he doesn't actively seek out the
songs he helped get on the air.
He doesn't need to - Motown
tunes can be heard everywhere,
from the radio to the grocery
store.
"Music is global and Motown
is global, too," Abrams said.
"You can't get away from it, but
that's not a bad thing."
For Abrams, every Motownhit
brings back a memory. This is a
sentiment fans all over the world!
can relate to, whether they were
involved in the music industry or
were just avid listeners.
"There's that phrase of
Motown being the 'soundtrack
of our lives,' and it's completely
true," Abrams said.
Despite sounding like a pub-
licist's slogan for a new Motown
"golden oldies" collection,
"the soundtrack of our lives" is
one Motown-related slogan -
unlike the Dylan quotation -
that Abrams didn't fabricate.

By SEAN CZARNECKI
DailyArts Writer
For millions around the world,
November was eclipsed by a
single night - the premiere of
"Breaking Dawn - Part 1." At
midnight on November 18th,
theaters throughout the coun-
try were filled with loyal fans as
the global phenomenon that has
seized popular culture slowly
drew to an end.
But what did this scene look
like in the Ann Arbor area?
When I arrived at Rave 20
in Ypsilanti, I wanted a quirky
story. I wanted angry middle-
aged book club members wield-
ing a battering ram to knock
down the doors. Hell, with the
media's coverage of girlish mobs
swarming Robert Pattinson, I
expected it. I expected there to
be two different lines for Team
Edward and Team Jacob to pre-
vent a riot. I expected to see
tweenage hearts melting at the
mere sight of Pattinson's card-
board cutout.
I'm not a fan of "Twilight." As
I rode to Rave 20, I was expect-
ing airhead responses - "Umm,
like, I'm Team Edward, but only
when Jacob keeps his shirt on," a
friend of mine joked.
Instead, I walked into this:
fans being welcomed in from the
cold; quiet, orderly lines and the
room's small talk punctuated by
the sound of chattering teeth.
Even more bewildering - there
were men present. As a "Twilight"
outsider, I had always assumed
that these premieres were an XY-
prohibited event. I would think
these men were forced to go by a
significant other.
But that was not always the
case. In one of the lines stood a
young man named Chris Man-
ning, a Target employee, waiting
patiently with his arms crossed.
"I'm here for the film," he
explained simply. "I'm a fan."
Well, that's understandable
enough. But now for the real test
of fanhood, the great existential
question of our time: Was this

Seniors look to solidify legacy
with win over rival Buckeyes

Hoke won't use losing
streak against OSU
as motivation for 'M'

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
The whole Michigan football
program was crashing down
around them. They had no
coach. No reason to be proud
just days after an embarrassing
loss in a bowl game that ulti-
mately was the final straw in
their coach's dismissal.
The soon-to-be-seniors were
of a different breed, having
already suffered through the
first bowl drought in 30-plus
years. Even more rare, the fifth-
year seniors were about to meet
their third coach in five years,
something that hadn't been
done since the 1920s.
"There were rumors that
Denard (Robinson) was going to
transfer," said fifth-year senior
defensive end Ryan Van Bergen.
"There was going to be people
going all over the place. Every-
body was going to jump ship."
"We've seen it before - we
saw it when coach (Lloyd) Carr
left and Rich Rodriguez came
in - where everyone who was
on that swing fence, where they
could either leave or stay, they
left," added fifth-year senior
center David Molk. "And we
kind of disbanded as a team.
And it wasn't good for our team
in a lot of ways."
In early January, Van Bergen
and Molk called a team meeting
to make sure everyone bought
in - not to a coach, but to them-
selves.
"We didn't really have (a
coach)," Van Bergen said.
"There was speculation it was
going to be the coach from
Stanford or LSU. And we're just
like, 'We need to stick together.
Whatever happens, we've got
a good thing going that people
don't necessarily see.'
"We wanted to see this thing
through."
All season long, the seniors
have been the legs of Michigan
coach Brady Hoke's operation,
driving the 9-2 machine the
Wolverines have become. That's
why Hoke's not doing much dif-
ferent this week as a matchup
with Ohio State looms. The
only change will be when they
practice on Thursday, and that's
because of a planned Thanks-
giving dinner.
Consistency is important,
Hoke says, from the film room
to the preparation. He even
said practices wouldn't be more
physical, even if The Game will
be. But that's because his prac-
tices are notoriously physical
already - the same for Iowa as

The Michigan senior class organized a team meeting in Januaryto make sure the team remained unified.

they are for Ohio State.
Once he built the machine,
there was no sense in screw-
ing with what the seniors had
going.
The difference this week -
as it has been every week - will
be the seniors, who have one
last shot to beat the Buckeyes
and end the program's seven-
game losing streak against its
archrival. The seniors are the
ones holding everyone else
accountable, pushing everyone
to improve each week, making
the whole thing go.
"This is a huge game for our
legacy as a team, for this senior
group, for Team 132," senior
defensive tackle Mike Martin
said after the Nebraska game.
"We just got to make sure we
finish this season out the way
we want to, and the way we
envisioned the whole season."
Their redemption season has
been impressive already, turn-
ing around a porous defense
and returning the program to
national relevance in just 11
games.
No one doubts the seniors
deserve their due credit.
Carr still bumps into a few of
the fifth-year players he recruit-
ed, and when he sees them he
tells them how proud he is that
they persevered. Hoke always
said that the team wouldn't go
very far if he had to lead them,
and he's deflected much of the
praise for Michigan's success to

his senior leadership.
Ohio State coach Luke Fickell
agreed.
"I think it starts with momen-
tum, and adversity creates some
toughness," Fickell said. "The
ability to have some older guys
and some seniors that have been
through some tough times, have
been through a lot of ups and
downs, only makes you stronger
in the long run."
The mature focus of his team
allows Hoke to be hands off this
week. Instead of basking in the
glory of their Nebraska win,
focus shifted almost immedi-
ately to preparation for The
Game. And the mood around
Schembechler Hall was "more
serious than normal" on Sun-
day, Van Bergen said.
That may be the only differ-
ence - that the values and dili-
gent preparation Hoke and the
seniors instilled are amped up
a notch.
Van Bergen described the
"tunnel vision" he turned on
to focus on each individual
practice, and how he can keep
improving - a mantra of Hoke's
team - instead of getting swal-
lowed by The Game's excite-
ment. But Hoke admitted he
thought a few of the seniors
may have already been get-
ting caught up in it, putting too
much pressure on themselves
this week.
It's a heavy thought - how
the seniors could complete their

remarkable journey from Carr's
final season to Hoke's new
regime with a win over the reel-
ing Buckeyes.
The expectation, though, is
bigger than just Ohio State, a
team Hoke has made a priority
of beating since day one. The
way they talk about The Game,
it's more about Michigan, how
they bought into themselves all
the way back in January.
"I thought we were going
to win more games than this,"
Robinson said bluntly. "The
best that we can do is go 10-2. So
we've got to do what we've got
to do to go 10-2."
The machine keeps churning:
November is when champion-
ships are won, Hoke told them.
Now - as it has been building
to this crescendo all season -
championship month is capped
by The Game of all games.
No one would admit what a
win over Ohio State would do
for their legacies, but, in gener-
alities, beating the Buckeyes is
all part of the goals.
"We have the potential to win
11 games," Van Bergen said on
Nov. 14, even before Michigan
throttled Nebraska.
"There's no reason to be sat-
isfied with what we've done so
far. If we sit on what we've done
so far, our legacy won't be any-
thing special. But if you win 10
games at Michigan, win your
bowl game, you're going to be
remembered for a long time."

Michigan enters
The Game with
better record for
first time since '04
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
Fifth-year senior center David
Molk was a freshman at Lemont
High School. Junior quarterback
Denard Robinson was in the sev-
enth grade at Deerfield Beach
Middle School. Michigan coach
Brady Hoke was coaching in a
41-14 loss to Bowling Green in
the final game of his first season
as head coach of Ball State.
The current members of the
Michigan football team were in
plenty of different places on Nov.
22, 2003, the last time the Wol-
verines beat Ohio State. But there
was one common thread: none of
the football team's current mem-
bers remember much about that
day.
Michigan has literally forgot-
ten what it's like to beat the Buck-
eyes.
The reaction of many to the
winless streak was summed up
by Robinson's prolonged "wow"
at Monday's press conference
when he was told how long it had
been.
The streak hasn't been pretty
for the Wolverines. In the sev-
en-year stretch, Ohio State has
outscored them by 110 points.
The margin of defeat has been in
the single digits just two times.
Current Michigan players have
endured the worst of that, get-
ting outscored 100-24 in the past
three years.
Despite the lopsided margin
and general one-sidedness of
the rivalry, players had mixed
thoughts onthe streak. Some said
they weren't thinking about it.
"It's notsomethingthataffects
me everyday," Molk said. "It's
just another game. It's something
that we have to win as a part of
our season."
Others dealt with it more
directly.
"That weighs a little heavier

on you, knowing we haven't beat
them in a long time," said senior
tight end Kevin Koger.
Hoke admitted the streak
wasn't "very good," but he won't
use it to create more motivation
for Saturday's game.
"I haven't talked about that
with our team and probably
won't," Hoke said. "We've got
educated young men that are
here at a great university and I
think me telling them that would
probably insult them and their
intelligence."
For the first time since 2004,
Michigan enters the game with a
better record.
The 17th-ranked Wolverines
sit at 9-2, while Ohio State, after a
summer of scandal that saw Jim
Tressel andhis 9-1 record against
Michigan leave Columbus, sits
at just 6-5. Michigan opened the
week as 8.5-point favorites. The
Columbus Dispatch took down
its count of how many days it has
been since the Wolverines beat
the Buckeyes and replaced it with
a to-the-minute countdown until
kickoff.
Most signs point toward this
being the year the streak is bro-
ken, and it may be Michigan's
best chance.
Former Florida head coach
Urban Meyer has reportedly
been in discussion with Ohio
State administration about tak-
ing over the head coaching job
from interim coach Luke Fickell
at the end of the season. Meyer
won two national championships
with the Gators.
With Meyer possibly on the
way and Buckeye freshman quar-
terback Braxton Miller likely
to improve by next season, this
could be the Wolverines' best
chance to break the streak in the
foreseeable future.
Does that add a little more
pressure to Michigan's "Team
132?"
"No," Molk said. "I don't think
that really adds any pressure to
anything. It's Ohio State-Miehi-
gan. It is what it is."
It's a rivalry game, so no
outcome is guaranteed. But
one thing is: these players will
remember Saturday.

Paul named Lacrosse Person of the Year

Coach earns honor
in program's first
season at varsity-
level lacrosse
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's lacrosse
team hasn't even completed its
first season as a varsity sport,
but coach
John Paul First seen on
is already -the
receiving game
national
attention - Lacrosse Magazine
named Paul its 2011 Person of
the Year.
"This is a great honor," Paul
said. "I'm very proud of what
we've been able to accomplish
here at Michigan. I'm thankful
to Lacrosse Magazine for rec-
ognizing our efforts."
Paul has spent 26 seasons
surrounded by Michigan
lacrosse as both a player and a
coach.
An Ann Arbor native, he
played for the club team before
taking over the reigns as head
coach in 1997.
The club team turned into a
powerhouse under Paul's direc-
tion.
It boasts a commanding 241-
41 record over the past 14 years,

and has gone o the Men's Col-
legiate Lacrosse Association
national championship three
out of the last four years.
But Paul's efforts in trans-
forming the team from a club
to a varsity sport were what put
him in the national spotlight.
"Michigan going varsity was
a landmark moment for college
lacrosse," said Matt DaSilva,
the editor of Lacrosse Maga-
zine. "(It) will hopefully inspire
more brand name universities
to invest in the sport at its most
visible level.
"John Paul made it happen.
He did it for the love of the
game."
Michigan is the first univer-
sity whose football program
participates in the BCS series
to add a men's varsity lacrosse
team since 1981.
And this was something that
had been on Paul's mind of a
long time.
Paul approached Athletic
Director Dave Brandon shortly
after Brandon's appointment in
January of 2010.
"From the minute I met JP,
he was on a mission and had a
passion for getting his program
to the D-1 level," Brandon said.
The growing popularity of
the sport encouraged Brandon
to promote both the men and
women's club lacrosse teams to
the varsity level.
In five months last spring,

- mon-

STEPHEN J.NESBIT T/Daily
Michigan coach John Paul is transitioning his team from club to varsity lacrosse.

Paul raised the $6 million need-
ed from alumni and former
players to kick-start the two
programs.
In May, it was official-
ly announced that the two
lacrosse teams would partici-
pate at the Division-1 level. In
June, Paul was officially named
the head coach of the men's
team. The women's program
will go varsity next season.
"We wouldn't be where we

are now without a great group
of people who are passionate
about two things I love: the
University of Michigan and
lacrosse," Paul said.
"The people I work with,
coach with and coach for
deserve just as much recogni-
tion."
The Wolverines kick off their
inaugural season on Feb 12,
2012 against the University of
Detroit.

to take exception to Michigan's From there, Michigan relied

on its defense. The team strug-
gled at times to run offensive
sets in the face of increased
Tiger pressure, but it stymied
Memphis on the other end,
refusing to allow the Tigers to
overcome the deficit.
Sophomore forward Jon
Horford had his best game yet
defensively, with redshirt soph-
omore forward Jordan Morgan
sitting early due to foul trouble.
Horford established himself
in the paint and prevented the
many takes to the basket that
Memphis relied on.
The Tigers were forced to
start shooting more from the
outside in the second half, tak-
ing them out of their comfort
zone. And Michigan constantly
attacked the boards, cleaning
up Memphis misses and pre-
venting second-chance oppor-
tunities.
The, Wolverines won the
rebounding battle, 38-29, and
held the Tigers to just 33.3 per-
cent shooting from the field for
the game.
"I think we just made hits,"
Novak said. "We really knew
that they were going to fly at the
glass. That's how they scored a
lot of points in the tapes that we
saw. So we figured if we could
keep them off the glass and not
give them second chances, our
chances to win will go way up."

The Tigers tried to come back
by turning the game into more
of an up-and-down affair, but
couldn't capitalize on its ath-
leticism advantage with Burke
able to keep up in the backcourt.
"They like to run in transi-
tion, so we made sure we had
guys back there just commu-
nicating," Hardaway Jr. said.
"That was one of the key things
we did (was) communicate real-
ly well to stop the ball coming
down the fast break. Just point-
ing out to your man who you
got."
The beginning of the game
was also fast-paced. Surprising-
ly, Michigan ran step-for-step
with Memphis, taking the early
10-4 lead after Hardaway Jr.'
s layup three minutes in. The
Wolverines kept it up, putting
together their best offensive
half of the season. Led by Hard-
away Jr.'s 11 points and a 10-0
run to close the period, Michi-
gan shot 15-for-25 from the field
to take a 37-31 lead going into
the break.
"When they went on that run,
the game definitely changed,"
Barton said. "Like (Memphis
coach Josh Pastner) said, we
stopped attacking the basket.
We started settling for jump
shots. We didn't do a good job
in transition defense. ... that's
when they hurt us the most."

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
LAHAINA, Hawaii - Mem-
phis was a team that was
supposed to give the No. 15
Michigan men's basketball team
and its inexperienced freshman
point guard Trey Burke all kinds
of problems.
Instead, Burke spent the day
whizzing through the humid
Maui air - and the Tigers'
defense - to give the Wolver-
ines an early statement victory,
73-61.
"I tell you, I know (Michi-
gan) lost a really good player
in Darius Morris, who is a pro,
but they didn't really have too
much drop-off with Burke," said
Memphis coach Josh Pastner.
"He's really good, and he's only
a freshman. He's a really good
talent."
Heading into the Maui Invi-
tational, No. 8 Memphis (1-1)
looked like it would be a night-
mare matchup for Michigan's
offense. Burke was tasked
with breaking the Tigers' ath-
letic, pressure-oriented press
defense. To revive the Wol-
verines' stagnant offense, he'd
have to go one-on-one with Joe
Jackson, one of the nation's top
point guards, and do it all on a
nationally-televised stage with
a hostile, Memphis-dominated
crowd breathing down his neck.
But Burke played beyond his
years. Only once, late in the sec-
ond half with the game already
decided, did Burke have prob-
lems breaking the press, forcing
Michigan (4-0) to call a timeout.
"The goal was to stay poised
out there on the court," Burke
said. "We knew they were going
to bring up their hardest punch,
and we knew they had quick
guards.
"So beforethe game, the game
plan was basically for us as ball
handlers to stay poised out there
to keep the team under control,
and we did a good job of that."
The freshman matched a
career high with 14 points,
thanks to an impressive 6-for-
10 shooting. Though he had just
four assists, his most impressive
statistic was likely his turnovers
- he had only three.
"I made sure I stayed under
control," Burke said. "With
Joe Jackson pressuring me full
court, I basically just had to take
my time and get the offense into

what we were running. We did
a good job with executing on
offense and crashing the board."
Burke made his presence felt
from the opening minute. Just
40 seconds into the game, he
took the ball into the paint and
created space with a ballerina-
esque spin move, to give himself
an open layup.
Memphis continued to chip
away at the Wolverines, who
were unable to pull away. With
just over eight minutes remain-
ing, Burke again created space
in the lane with a spin move,
collapsing the Tiger defense and
leaving sophomore guard Tim
Hardaway Jr. wide open on a
backdoor cut for a layup to put
Michigan ahead by 12.
Minutes later, after a Mem-
phis 3-pointer cut its deficit to
nine, Burke drove through the
lane, and reminiscent of his
predecessor Morris, lofted in a
floater in traffic before landing
on his back.
Burke's most influential play
may have came in an unlikely
situation: in the lane on the
defensive end.
After Michigan fell behind,
31-27, with three minutes left
in the first half, the Wolverines
stormed back with a 10-0 run
thanks to five straight points
from Burke. With just seconds
remaining in the half, Jackson
drove right at Burke, attempting
a buzzer-beating layup to recap-
ture the momentum entering
the half.
But Burke was there, staying
in front of Jackson, to swat away
the layup and fire up the Wol-
verines' sidelines. As the teams
made their way to the locker
rooms, a scuffle ensued that
originatedwhenMemphis's Will
Barton shoved Michigan senior
guard Zack Novak. Though no
punches were thrown, center-
court turned into the grounds
for a shoving match, intensify-
ing halftime.
Using their momentum, the
Wolverines stormed out of the
gate in the second half and
never looked back.
The celebration didn't let up
and when the game was over 12
minutes later, skeptics of Michi-
gan and its youthful backcourt
questioned themselves. And on
a national stage, within a stone's
throw of Maui's beautiful Pacif-
ic oceanside, Burke just said
"Aloha," to a bright future.


'M' confident despite sweep

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Wolverines get rematch against
No. 6 Duke in Maui Invitational

By MATT SLOVIN

Nestled in an otherwise bare
nook in a northwest corridor
of Yost Ice Arena sits a vending
machine. The sound of sticks
slapping pucks and pucks nail-
ing boards drowns out the
machine's quiet whirring.
But this machine doesn't sell
chips or cookies. Instead, its
products are pieces of card stock
with statistics on the back so
small you have to squint to read
them - trading cards.
Its big-ticket item sits front
and center and also carries a
heavier price tag than all of the
other cards. And why shouldn't
it? Ten dollars will get you a Red
Berenson card.
Perched in the upper rows of
the machine, Berenson is depict-
ed in his 1970s St. Louis Blues
sweater, skating behind the
goal. The confidence on his face
doesn't waver.
But does Berenson have that
same confidence in his skaters in
the midst of the program's lon-
gest slump since 2009?
The answer is a resounding
yes.
That's hardly to say, though,
that the effort has always been
there.
"I think we can play harder
and better," Berenson said.
It's not just confidence that
will eventually bust this Wol-
verine slump. Berenson looks for
resiliency. His teams are known
for it, actually, and last year was
no exception. Berenson remem-
bers a late-season sweep at the
hands of Miami (Ohio) as the
best example of the squad's abil-
ity to bounce back, en route to

ADAM
Michigan coach Red Berenson trusts his team will bounce back<

an appearance in the National
Championship game.
And with the confidence he
demonstrated while centering
the Blues to three consecutive
Stanley Cup Finals appearances,
Berenson anticipates that resil-
iency.
"Last year's team at this
point wasn't a lot better than
this year's team," he said. "They
bounced back ... we have to be
able to bounce back, too. I think
this team has resiliency."
Berenson called last week-
end's sweep at the hands of Ohio
State a "bad weekend." That's
probably putting the Wolver-
ines' two losses to the Buckeyes
this weekend lightly. After all,
allowing six goals in a game -
like it did Saturday - serves as
a reminder of how lax Michigan
defense has been recently.

And those "bad weekends"
are a luxury that Berenson won't
afford his teams.
He doesn't expect perfection,
but he knows as well as anyone
that hockey is a sport of streaks
and how teams respond to them.
"You're not going to win all
your games," Berenson said.
"I've always said you shouldn't
lose two in a row."
This weekend, No. 11 Michi-
gan will try to avoid dropping a
third straight game. Senior cap-
tain Luke Glendening readily
admits that Berenson's signature
confidence may be contagious -
albeit a "quiet" confidence. And
the resiliency that his coach
expects - or demands - isn't far
behind.
"I think we'll battle back,"
Glendening said. "I think we'll
be OK."
