SEXUAL MISCONDUCT POLICY

University considers 
changes to appeals 
process, witness 

testimony

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

University administrators sat 

down with students Monday and 
Tuesday night to discuss potential 
changes to the Student Sexual 
Misconduct Policy.

Holly Rider-Milkovich, director 

of the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center, and Patricia 
Petrowski, associate vice president 
and deputy general counsel, told 
students that revisions to the 
policy will be based on a variety of 
factors — including comparisons 
to peer institutions’ policies and 
suggestions voiced by students, 
faculty and SAPAC.

“As we’ve been gathering that 

information, we’ve been thinking 
about what are some ways we can 
strengthen the policy and respond 
to some of the concerns,” Rider-

Milkovich said.

The pending changes come two 

years after the Student Sexual 
Misconduct Policy was last revised 
in August 2013.

Rider-Milkovich and Petrowski 

had already proposed a number 
of changes to the current policy, 
which 
they 
discussed 
with 

students in a round table format.

Under the current policy, either 

the complainant or the respondent 
can appeal a case’s outcome after 
the Office for Institutional Equity 
reviews the report and the Office 
of Student Conflict Resolution 
decides sanctions.

According to Rider-Milkovich, 

this 
can 
render 
potential 

respondents 
and 
complainants 

unable to agree upon sanctions 
because they are not finished 
disputing evidence — which could 
lengthen the procedure.

Subsequently, she said, the 

first and most complex policy 
change would involve separating 
the appeals process to allow 
for objections at both the OIE 
and OSCR levels, as opposed to 
appealing them collectively.

Political Science Prof. John Chamberlin speaks about the process of electing local public owfficials at “Ann Arbor Elections: Exploring Options” panel discussion 
hosted by The League of Women Voters of the Ann Arbor Area at the Ann Arbor downtown public library on Tuesday.

Several members of 
City Council attend 
discussion on local 
electoral system

By ANASTASSIOS

Daily Staff Reporter

With a heavily Democratic 

electorate, Ann Arbor City Council 
elections are typically determined 

during primary season. But since a 
large portion of Ann Arbor voters 
absent in August, some residents 
have called for changes to election 
dates.

According to an interactive 

panel discussion hosted Tuesday 
by the League of Women Voters 
of the Ann Arbor Area, the dates 
aren’t likely to change in the near 
future.

About 25 attendees, including 

councilmembers Jack Eaton (D–
Ward 4), Julie Grand (D–Ward 3) 
and Kirk Westphal (D–Ward 2), 

joined a panel of experts inside 
the Ann Arbor District Library 
to discuss election dates, voter 
turnout and partisanship in Ann 
Arbor elections.

Panelists first responded to 

questions prepared by the LWV 
— a nonpartisan organization 
that promotes political awareness 
and activism — and then took 
questions from attendees.

The panel consisted of John 

Chamberlin, a professor of public 
policy, Lawrence Kestenbaum, 
the Washtenaw County clerk and 

Joseph Ohren, a political science 
professor at Eastern Michigan 
University.

The panel stressed that election 

dates in Ann Arbor cannot change 
without changes to Michigan 
Election Law.

“When we talk about changing 

the schedules of elections in 
Ann Arbor, the elections pretty 
much have to be in November 
and the primaries in August,” 
Kestenbaum said.

GOVERNMENT

After RFRA passes 
in Indiana, similar 
proposal generates 
discussion in Mich.

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

A 
bill 
that 
would 
allow 

individuals to claim exemptions 
from certain laws on religious 
grounds 
has 
garnered 
new 

attention in Michigan following 
controversy over the passage 
of a similar Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act in Indiana.

A RFRA bill was originally 

introduced to the Michigan state 
Senate in January. Currently, 20 
states have passed versions of 
the RFRA following a 1997 U.S. 
Supreme Court decision that 
ruled a national version of the 
law was not applicable to state 
laws. Though they vary between 
states, 
RFRA 
bills 
generally 

allow businesses and citizens to 
claim exemptions from state laws 
if they can prove the laws violate 

strongly-held religious beliefs.

A similar version of the bill 

introduced last year failed to pass 
in the year’s lame-duck session.

Opponents of the bill have 

said the RFRA will hinder 
discrimination protections for 
multiple groups, namely the 
LGBTQ 
community. 
These 

concerns were highlighted after 
several incidents in Indiana have 
occurred — including a pizzeria 
that gained national attention 
saying it would refuse to cater to 
same-sex weddings.

Michael 
Woodford, 
an 

assistant professor of social work 
at Wilfrid Laurier University in 
Ontario, Canada who studies the 
LGBTQ community, said RFRAs 
are a concern for a variety 
of 
reasons, 
including 
their 

potential to imply that some 
groups have less legal protection 
than others.

“We think about the stigma 

and marginalization — especially 
when 
we’re 
talking 
about 

legislation,” Woodford said. “It’s 
basically saying the people we 
elect to make laws think that

Election Code

By LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporter

The newly elected 2015-2016 

Central Student Government 
assembly met for the first time 
Tuesday night.

The first order of business was 

swearing in LSA junior Cooper 
Charlton and LSA sophomore 
Steven Halperin as the new CSG 
president and vice president, 
respectively, 
and 
the 
fifth 

assembly as a whole.

“I ... do solemnly swear that 

I will to the best of my ability 
preserve and champion the 
all campus constitution of the 
Ann Arbor student body,” the 
assembly announced together.

After 
being 
sworn 
in, 

Charlton promised three things 

to the assembly: confidence, 
respect and execution.

“If we do not do the first two 

— confidence and respect — we 
will not be able to execute,” he 
said. “I hope we will all be able 
to work together to make sure 
next year is a hell of a year for 
not only our students but for 
the University of Michigan as 
a whole.”

‘U’ researchers 

explain why officials 
overestimated the 
disease’s spread

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

According to figures updated 

generated by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 
the federal government likely 
overestimated 
the 
extent 
of 

Ebola’s spread.

In 
Septmember, 
the 
CDC 

predicted Sierra Leone, Guinea 
and Liberia would experience 
1.4 million cases of Ebola cases 
by Jan. 20, 2015 without the 
implementation 
of 
additional 

interventions.

As of Tuesday, the total number 

of suspected or confirmed cases 
totaled 25,611 in the three countries 
— 
far 
lower 
than 
originally 

predicted by the CDC.

THROW ME A CONE
HEALTH

A wireless health lab at UCLA 

recently developed WearSens 
— a necklace that can track the 
amount of food and drink a per-
son consumes.

The device connects to an 

application 
that 
recommends 

meal patterns and is able to track 
nutrition intake by monitoring 
the movement of neck muscles.

While the necklace does not 

count calories, it does track food 
patterns, such as how often a 
person is snacking and whether 
or not a person is regularly eating 
breakfast.

Majid Sarrafzadeh, the com-

puter science professor who runs 
the lab, said he thinks that by giv-
ing people a way to monitor their 
eating habits, the device could 

cut medical costs for preventable 
diseases.

Pennsylvania State Univer-

sity sexual assault education 

petition gains momentum

Nearly 25,000 people have 

signed a Care2 petition, written 
by Penn State University alumni, 
which asks Penn State’s adminis-
trators to provide sexual assault 
education for all students.

According to the petition, the 

educational 
programs 
would 

cover bystander intervention, 
consent, survivor support and 
Title IX and Clery Act rights.

Last month, the Penn State 

chapter of Kappa Delta Rho was 
accused of operating a secret 

Facebook page that included 
nonconsensual photos of nude 
women. After the allegations 
surfaced, an anonymous mem-
ber of the fraternity said the page 
was “satire.”

“The responses of the public 

and KDR’s anonymous member 
illustrate the Penn State com-
munity is not properly educated 
in matters of consent and sexual 
assault,” said Julie Mastrine, 
petition co-author and Penn 
State alum, in a press release. 
“It’s troubling that many in the 
PSU community do not under-
stand why sharing nonconsen-
sual photos of naked women is 
morally wrong.”

Researchers find stem cell 
associated with leukemia

Testing on mice 
reveals gene could 
lead to advances in 
diagnosis, treatment 

By SANJAY REDDY 

Daily Staff Reporter

A new study conducted by 

University 
researchers 
has 

identified a gene that plays a 
role in regulating blood-forming 
stem cells.

The study, published in the 

Journal of Clinical Investigation, 
provides new insight into the 
role of the absent, small or 
homeotic 1-like (Ash1L) gene in 
the human blood system. The 
research sheds new light on the 
scientific processes involved in 
both maintaining healthy blood 
cells and renewing old and 
diseased ones.

Ivan 
Maillard, 
assistant 

Hematology/Oncology professor 

and a senior author of the study, 
said a central feature of the study 
was the association researchers 
uncovered between Ash1L and 
another gene, Mixed Lineage 
Leukemia 1 — or MLL1 — which 
belongs to the same family.

“We saw that this gene (Ash1L) 

was playing an important function 
in the blood-forming stem cells, 
but also that it was doing so 
in 
conjunction 
with 
another 

member of the same family that 
has previously been implicated in 
leukemia,” he said.

Maillard 
said 
it 
is 
this 

association 
between 
Ash1L 

and MLL1 that has researchers 
excited. Finding a link between 
Ash1L and leukemia creates the 
possibility of making advances 
in both diagnosing and treating 
leukemia.

Rackham 
student 
Jennifer 

Chase, an author of the study, said 
researchers are looking into how 
Ash1L and MLL1 cooperate.

“Once 
we 
understand 
the 

biochemistry 
behind 
their 

interaction, we will be able to 

make 
therapeutic 
approaches 

toward the diseases that they are 
involved in,” Chase said.

Researchers 
used 
mice 
to 

investigate the Ash1L gene. They 
selectively inhibited Ash1L in 
one contingent of mice, MLL1 in 
a second contingent and both in a 
third contingent. Results showed 
a mild reduction in blood-forming 
stem cells in the bone marrow for 
mice missing either Ash1L or Mll1, 
but a catastrophic effect for mice 
missing both.

“When we looked at the bone 

marrow of the mice and saw no 
stem cells, that was very unusual,” 
Chase said. “These experiments 
showed that the Ash1L gene is 
critically important in regulating 
stem cells in mice.”

Maillard said perhaps one of the 

biggest implications of this study is 
the potential it creates for future 
research. One avenue researchers 
can take is inhibiting the gene, and 
the proteins it encodes, to further 
understand its chemical function.

Even more exciting, Maillard 

said, is that further research may 
indicate Ash1L plays a role in a 
host of different diseases.

“Because this gene is so well-

conserved in evolution, we think 
that it is possible for it to have 
a role in many different human 
cancers in different organs,” 
Maillard said.

Abducted Nigerian 
girls remembered on 
anniversary of “Bring 

Back Our Girls” 

LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — They 

have been gone a year now, the 
hundreds of girls abducted by Is-
lamic militants from their school 
in northeastern Nigeria.

And while the cry to “Bring 

Back Our Girls” remains a world-
wide cause, the new president 
Tuesday would not repeat his pre-
decessor’s failed promise to find 
them — only that they won’t be 
forgotten.

A solemn march was held to re-

member the 219 girls seized from 
their boarding school in Chibok 
by gunmen from the Boko Ha-
ram extremist group. In Nigeria’s 
capital of Abuja, 219 girls paraded 
in the streets, with each carrying 
a placard bearing the name of a 
kidnap victim.

“We believe the girls are still 

alive,” said Dr. Allan Manasseh, 
the brother of missing 18-year-old 
Maryamu Wavi, in an interview 

with The Associated Press.

But it was clear that hope has 

dwindled a year after the April 14-
15 mass abduction.

President-elect 
Muhammadu 

Buhari said he must be honest 
about the prospects of getting the 
missing girls back to their families.

“We do not know if the Chibok 

girls can be rescued. Their where-
abouts remain unknown,” Buhari 
said in a statement. “As much as I 
wish to, I cannot promise that we 
can find them.”

The statement by Buhari, a 

former military ruler of Nigeria 
who was elected last month and 
takes over May 29, is a marked 
departure from President Good-
luck Jonathan. After Jonathan’s 
administration initially denied 
there had even been a kidnap-
ping, he made repeated hollow 
promises that the girls would be 
rescued.

Campaigners have replaced the 

slogan of “Bring Back Our Girls — 
Now and Alive!” with a new one: 
“Never to be forgotten.”

Still, some of the marchers 

Tuesday held the new leadership 
accountable.

“We are here to appeal to the 

government to do better. We want 

our girls now and alive,” said Sol-
amipe Onifade, 16.

The gunmen initially seized 

276 girls, but several dozen man-
aged to escape as the militants 
transported them to the Sam-
bisa Forest, with some clinging 
to the branches of trees from a 
moving open-back truck. Those 
still missing may have been split 
up. Witnesses said some girls 
were taken across the border 
into Cameroon.

Boko Haram’s leader, Abuba-

kar Shekau, claimed they had 
converted to Islam and been 
married off to his fighters.

A negotiator said that at least 

three died in the early days, from 
a snake bite, malaria and dysen-
tery. Then, Jonathan refused 
to negotiate with Boko Haram, 
who were offering to exchange 
the girls for detained insurgents.

The girls became the focus of a 

global campaign soon after their 
abduction. U.S. first lady Michelle 
Obama had said she was “out-
raged and heartbroken” about 
the kidnapping and also posted a 
picture of herself holding a sign 
reading “#BringBackOurGirls” 
on her official Twitter account 
in May 2014.

speaker of the assembly. Reps. 
Noah Betman and Ben Meisel, 
both LSA sophomores, received 
nominations. 
Betman 
was 

ultimately elected to the post.

As speaker, Betman said he 

hopes to improve the logistical 
and transparency issues in the 
assembly 
through 
initiatives 

such as making the assembly’s 
agenda known to the general 
public before meetings and asking 
representatives to submit reports 
from their respective meetings.

Reps. Allie Lisner and Catherine 

Bergin, both LSA sophomores, 
received nominations for vice 
speaker of the assembly.

Bergin, who was elected to the 

position, emphasized the past 
experiences she felt made her a 
qualified nominee, such as acting 
as the host and writer for her high 
school broadcasting show.

“Despite it being my first year 

here (on CSG), I feel I would 
definitely be an asset as vice 
speaker,” she said.

Third-year Law student Paige 

Becker, who served as this year’s 
CSG election director, was the 
guest 
speaker 
at 
Tuesday’s 

meeting. The Undergraduate 
Election Code requires Becker 
to debrief the assembly after 
each election.

Becker said there was a voter 

turnout of 24 percent in this year’s 
presidential and vice presidential 
election, which rose from 22 
percent in last year’s election. 
Further, more than 100 candidates 
ran for a seat on the assembly, 
and 40 out of the 58 seats on the 
assembly were contested.

Becker also suggested potential 

changes to the election code. 
These 
included 
limiting 
the 

number of complaints each party 
is allowed to file, improving 
campaign volunteer education and 
the possible institution of a run-off 
election in certain cases.

The only new piece of business 

presented in Tuesday’s meeting 
was a resolution requesting the 
University’s Investment Office 
conduct an audit every three years 
of all companies the University 
invests in that may be committing 
unethical practices anywhere in 
the world.

“I thought that I saw that 

students weren’t very happy 
with 
how 
the 
University’s 

endowment was being spent,” 
said Engineering senior Andy 
Modell, author of the resolution.

The 
resolution 
further 

requested if these audits find 
any companies responsible for 
immoral actions, they present 
a plan that will reposition the 
University’s funds to a “materially 
superior ethical state.”

The assembly requested the first 

audit be presented by the end of 
March 2016. The resolution moved 
to the resolutions committee.

Aaron King, associate professor 
of 
ecology 
and 
evolutionary 

biology and mathematics at the 
University, and his colleagues, 
sought to answer what lead to this 
overestimation.

In the study, King and the 

other co-authors argue that faulty 
modeling was the cause for the 
errors in the initial predictions. 
In an e-mail to the Michigan 
Daily, King said no model is 
perfect, as they work through 
oversimplification.

“Like 
maps, 
(models) 

oversimplify reality,” he wrote. 
“Also like maps, that’s what makes 
them useful. The challenge in 
using models is to capture the 
key elements while ignoring the 
irrelevant details.”

King said one of the problems 

was that the model ignored the 
randomness in how Ebola is spread 
from person to person. An infected 
person can transmit the virus to 
either a few or many people, he 
said, so disease transmission is not 
entirely predictable.

“Models 
that 
ignore 
the 

random element in disease spread 
are simpler and easier to employ, 
but overstate the predictability of 
an outbreak,” he wrote.

Marisa Eisenberg, assistant 

professor 
of 
epidemiology 

and mathematics, wrote in an 
e-mail to the Daily that making 
predictions in the early phase of 
an epidemic is also challenging 
because 
researchers 
have 
to 

analyze with limited information.

“The 
lack 
of 
data 
and 

unreliability of what data there is 
can be very tricky to deal with,” 
Eisenberg wrote. “It’s a bit like 
weather prediction in some ways 

— making short-term predictions 
is more doable, but long-term 
predictions are more difficult and 
require more data.”

King 
also 
pointed 
out 

that 
the 
general 
modeling 

theory 
commonly 
used 
to 

predict outbreaks of diseases, 
including Ebola, H1N1, cholera 
and seasonal flu, assumes an 
exponential growth of the cases. 
Therefore, more Ebola cases lead 
to a greater number of predicted 
cases. Exponential growth is seen 
at the early phases of a disease 
outbreak.

Eden Wells, clinical associate 

professor of epidemiology, said 
changing conditions in the three 
West African countries included 
in the CDC predictions, such as 
additional foreign aid workers 
providing education about safe 
burial practices and providing 
medical help, could also have 
been why the disease spread 
much less than expected.

“Many of the assumptions 

that the modelers used were 
that the exponential growth 
would continue,” Wells said. 
“Because there were so many 
things 
rapidly 
evolving 
on 

the ground, the (exponential 
growth) didn’t happen. Models 
can overestimate because the 
assumptions change quickly.”

Wells added that although 

the 
model 
led 
to 
incorrect 

predictions of the outbreak, the 
overestimation 
was 
probably 

helpful in getting people to 
quickly respond to the disease.

“To 
me 
though, 

(overestimation) is not necessarily 
a horrible thing,” she said. “When 
we have to assume the worst 
possible scenario, it is a great way 
to get our government leaders and 
our healthcare providers around 
the world to move quickly.”

amendment in section 168.641 
of the Michigan Election Law, 
elections in cities across the state 
can take place in either February, 
May, 
August 
or 
November. 

Kestenbaum said there has been 
discussion at the state level about 
eliminating the February option.

Grand said she is interested at 

looking into changing term lengths 
as well as the years elections occur. 
Currently, city council terms are 
two years, and elections take place 
annually — with half of the seats 
contested in odd years and half in 
even years.

Holding elections every year 

creates problems for City Council, 
Grand said, as councilmembers are 
less willing to make compromises 
and cooperate when they are 
focused on reelection.

“Having 
gone 
through 
it 

recently in the last couple of years, I 
am concerned about the amount of 
time and effort that it takes to run 
an election versus governing so I 
am interested in other ways that we 
could structure elections,” she said.

Discussing term length, Grand 

said a change to four-year terms 
would help city councilmembers 
engage 
in 
increased 
coalition 

building and more substantive 
work. She also said elections 
should only occur on even years, so 
there would only be elections for 
new councilmembers every two 
years rather than every year.

“I would love to see us go to four 

year terms and (only) even years,” 
she said. “I think that would help 
with voter turnout. I think it would 
also help constituents so they 
could more closely identify their 
councilmembers. So if you have 
someone for a longer term you can 

develop a relationship with that 
person, you know that’s my person 
to go to.”

The 
panel 
also 
discussed 

partisanship in elections. Ann 
Arbor is currently one of only 
three municipalities in Michigan 
that have partisan elections. 
A 
partisan 
election 
means 

candidates are permitted to have 
party labels attached to their 
names on the ballot.

“I 
am 
inclined 
to 
think 

partisanship is not problem, at least 
in Ann Arbor, with the exception 
of the fact that Republicans don’t 
seem to want to run for office in 
Ann Arbor because the label is 
not something they wish to have 
tagged to their name these days,” 
Chamberlin said.

In places like Ann Arbor, where 

most candidates represent one 
party, party labels matter less, and 
sub-parties or factions can form, 
he added.

After 
the 
panel, 
Westphal, 

the 
city 
councilmember, 
said 

increasing voter turnout is critical. 
To this end, he is open to hearing 
new ideas, such as converting to a 
nonpartisan system.

“My goal is to get meaningful 

ballots in front of more people,” 
Westphal said. “However that’s 
done, I think the voters choose to 
do that. I just want to have more 
participation.”

Like 
Westphal, 
all 
three 

panelists 
articulated 
concerns 

with voter turnout. Ohren said 
the city does not need to increase 
the number of voters, but the 
engagement of those who vote.

“I think the question really is 

how do we engage the community 
in the decision making process. 
I think that’s what’s important 
to us,” Ohren said. Not how 
many people vote but rather how 
many people participate in the 

ELECTIONS

some groups should not have the 
same protection and there’s an 
inherent message in that that is 
really stigmatizing of a group. So 
if you think about young people 
growing up in an environment 
where they hear that, what kind 
of consequences does that have 
on their well-being?”

In response to backlash in 

Indiana, other states’ versions 
of the bills have died or stalled. 
Last week, Gov. Rick Snyder said 
in an interview with The Detroit 
Free Press he would veto the bill 
if it was given to him as a stand-
alone bill.

During last year’s lame-duck 

session, the bill was introduced 
alongside expansions to the 
state’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights 
Act to include protections for 
sexual orientation. Protections 
for gender identity were also 
proposed, but were not supported 
by the Republican caucus.

“Given all the events that are 

happening in Indiana, I thought 
it would be good to clarify 
my position,” Snyder said. “I 

would veto RFRA legislation in 
Michigan if it is a stand-alone 
piece of legislation.”

Snyder told the Free Press he 

would not support the bill unless it 
was accompanied by an expansion 
of the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights 
Act. He also said he does not 
want the LGBTQ protections to 
be included in the RFRA bill, and 
that he wants the two pieces of 
legislation to stay separate.

Woodford said he worried 

that an adjoining bill for LBGTQ 
rights would not be passed while 
the RFRA would.

“My concern would be, if in 

fact the legislation protecting 
— so enumerating gay/lesbian 
people and transgender people 
and such — if that would actually 
go through,” Woodford said.

Other experts on the issue 

said 
with 
or 
without 
the 

extension of the Elliott-Larsen 
Act, the RFRA won’t have a 
malicious impact on any group. 
Dr. Douglas Laycock, a law 
professor at the University of 
Virginia with University of 
Michigan ties, said even though 
he supports same-sex marriage, 
he doesn’t think the law will 
have a discriminatory effect.

“Most of the applications 

of 
Religious 
Freedom 
and 

Restoration Acts have nothing to 
do with discrimination,” Laycock 
said. “They’re about churches 
feeding the homeless, they’re 
about Muslim beards and head 
scarves, they’re about Sabbath 
observance. They’re about all the 
different ways in which minority 
religious practices come into 
conflict with sometimes unusual 
regulations.”

Laycock said some lawmakers 

may 
intend 
to 
discriminate 

through RFRA laws, but said 
viewing the laws through the lens 
of nondiscrimination showed that 
they have many more benefits and 
do not segregate others.

“Your right to believe in a 

religion doesn’t mean very much 
if you don’t have the right to 
practice it,” he said.

Wyatt Fore, spokesman for 

Outlaws, the University’s LGBTQ 
law student organization, said the 
organization is against the RFRA 
bill because it allows a group 
to legally discriminate against 
another. Like Woodford, Fore was 
also unsure whether extending 
the civil rights act would be 
enough to protect others.

“We very much are glad that 

Governor Snyder has threatened 
to 
veto 
RFRA, 
and 
that 

Governor Snyder has called for 
an expansion of the civil rights 
act, but we would need more 
details before we could think 
authoritatively on what that deal 
would be,” Fore said.

Fore drew a parallel between 

the federal government’s approach 
to desegregation in the 1960s with 
the path state governments are 
currently pursuing with RFRAs. 
He said when deliberating on the 
scope of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, lawmakers had two choices: 
ban segregation or discrimination 
in 
any 
businesses, 
or 
allow 

freedom of choice.

“These contemporary RFRA 

bills very much adopt the same 
sort of theory,” Fore said. “That is 
why these bills are so dangerous, 
not only for LGBT people, but also 
for all people who are protected 
under civil rights acts, because, if 
a baker can say: we will not bake 
for gay people, then they can also 
say: we will not bake for Jewish 
people, we will not bake for Black 
people. That is very much a theory 
of discrimination that the current 
law very enthusiastically rejects.”

RFRA

In other words, this switch 

would 
allow 
either 
the 

complainant 
or 
respondent 

to appeal the findings of the 
OIE 
investigation 
first, 
and 

then appeal the sanctions after 
findings were resolved.

The change would also create 

two new outlets to field appeals.

OIE appeals would go to a panel 

of three representatives, made 
up of two faculty members — one 
from the Law School — appointed 
by the Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs and a student 
representative appointed by the 
Central Student Government.

This is a change from the 

current policy, where the existing 
general appeals panel includes one 
faculty member appointed by the 
Faculty Senate, one administrator 
appointed 
by 
the 
University 

president 
and 
one 
student 

appointed by CSG.

Additionally, 
OSCR 
appeals 

would 
be 
reviewed 
by 
a 

representative from the Office of 
the Provost. This measure, Rider-
Milkovich said, would allow for an 
objective voice external from the 
process to review documents and 
determine sanctions’ fairness.

“We believe it is important 

to have an outside perspective 
because OSCR is crafting the 
agreement itself,” she said.

Rider-Milkovich added that she 

hopes the appeals process change 
will shorten the time frame 
from reporting misconduct to 
carrying out the investigation and 
delivering sanctions. However, she 
said she recognizes that allowing 
two opportunities to appeal could 
have the reverse effect.

“This is our best thinking on 

a way to create a more authentic 
experience, but it’s possible that 
it lengthens the process, which 
is something that we know is a 
significant issue,” she said.

Petrowski mentioned that many 

universities do not separate their 
appeals system to differentiate 
case findings from sanctions.

Student attendees responded 

positively to the change in the 
process, 
but 
voiced 
concerns 

about the pending appeals process 
structure. A main concern was 
with the CSG’s role in choosing 

the student representative for the 
OIE panel.

“I really don’t like that CSG 

picks the student,” LSA junior 
Laura Meyer said, adding that 
she has little trust in CSG or 
knowledge about what it does.

LSA 
senior 
Kathryn 

Abercrombie, 
a 
former 
CSG 

representative and a leader in 
SAPAC, 
echoed 
Meyer’s 
fear 

that the CSG assembly does not 
always represent every voice 
on campus to the fullest extent. 
She mentioned there could be 
other areas on campus, such as 
the Trotter Multicultural Center 
or Intergroup Relations, from 
which the OIE panel could draw a 
student representative.

“I would argue that CSG is not 

representative of the student body, 
and that is I think the source of 
concern with having CSG appoint 
someone,” Abercrombie said.

A 
number 
of 
students 

participating in the roundtable 
talks suggested that the OIE 
panel 
adopt 
an 
open-call 

application 
for 
the 
student 

representative on the panel.

Another 
change 
Rider-

Milkovich 
and 
Petrowski 

proposed 
was 
to 
make 
the 

identity of any witnesses in the 
case known in reports and to the 
parties involved.

The current policy protects 

witness’ 
identities 
to 
make 

students feel more comfortable 
coming forward and sharing their 
stories without fear of retaliation 
in their various social groups.

Rider-Milkovich and Petrowski 

proposed naming the identities 
of witnesses to afford both the 
respondent and the complainant 

the best opportunity to defend 
themselves or prosecute their 
claims, because they could give 
more information regarding the 
accuracy of witness statements 
and motives.

Rider-Milkovich and Petrowski 

said this is the current trend 
for universities that are also 
undergoing policy revisions. They 
added that the OIE investigator 
overseeing a case would have the 
discretion to determine whether 
or not to hide the witness identity 
in cases where he or she believed 
the witness would be in physical 
danger otherwise.

Raina LaGrand, a graduate 

student in the Schools of Social 
Work and Public Health, said 
giving an OIE officer the discretion 
to grant witness anonymity could 
have the potential to be dangerous 
— especially given that the stigma 
surrounding sexual misconduct 
can vary among racial or cultural 
social groups.

“I think that the way different 

communities 
experience 

sexual assault on this campus, 
and 
protecting 
complainants 

or respondents, is drastically 
different,” LaGrand said.

Another potential change to 

the Student Sexual Misconduct 
Policy 
involves 
setting 

strict time limits during the 
investigative procedure.

Currently, the policy says the 

procedure aims to be complete 60 
days after the report is filed. Rider-
Milkovich admitted, however, this 
time frame is often extended.

“Less often we are able to meet 

60 days than we go over 60 days,” 
she said.

However, Petrowski said she 

has concerns about the strict 
timeline, adding that extensions 
are typically granted for a good 
reason, such as allowing for 
the most careful reviewing of 
documents possible.

“I can tell you as a former 

litigator it is much, much, much 
harder to draft a 10 or 15 page brief 
than it is a 50 page brief if there are 
a ton of facts,” she said. “You need to 
be very considerate about the main 
points you want to get across.”

Rider-Milkovich and Petrowski 

also proposed separating the 
appeals 
procedure 
from 
the 

Student 
Sexual 
Misconduct 

Policy to make each item more 
understandable. Petrowski added 
that doing so would also make it 
easier to adjust the appeals process 
independently from the policy’s 
review cycle.

The policy currently posted 

to the University’s website is 20 
pages long and includes a policy 
statement, section for definitions 
and appeals the process.

The proposed changes do 

not currently include revisions 
to the policy’s definition of 
consent. Last week, a report 
published in The Michigan Daily 
noted a discrepancy between 
the definition of consent applied 
during University disciplinary 
proceedings 
and 
the 
more 

stringent definition promoted 
by SAPAC.

Other proposed changes include 

adding a definition of “retaliation” 
to the sexual misconduct policy 
and approaching cases of dating 
violence, domestic violence and 
stalking in a non-sexual manner 
in the same way as allegations of 
sexual misconduct.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

A

fter reading the Daily’s spe-
cial report and editorial on 
University procedures for 

responding 
to 

reports of sexual 
assault last week, 
I 
was 
enraged 

and disheartened. 
My 
countenance 

hardened into a 
piercing glare as 
I walked around 
campus 
last 

Wednesday morn-
ing. 
Immense 

aggravation 
and 

embarrassment consumed me as I 
realized the University would, yet 
again, add to the prevalent narrative 
of sexual assault permeating college 
campuses. I was dismayed at hearing 
the University associated with sex-
ual assault and inaction. I was tired 
of feeling as if the threat of sexual 
assault continuously looms on college 
campuses nationwide — especially 
when definitions of consent remain 
immersed in misinterpretations.

I tossed around a multitude of 

heated musings: Why can’t we settle 
on an explicit definition to protect 
every individual? Why — as a popula-
tion of highly educated young adults 
— is establishing consent shrouded in 
uncertainty? Why is this knowledge 
gap so apparent as students enter 
college? Shouldn’t these issues have 
been discussed earlier in our lives?

The last question prompted me 

to consider my own experiences. 
I asked friends to describe what 
definition of consent they were 
exposed to and when that exposure 
occurred. However, when they redi-
rected the question to me, I was at a 
loss. I couldn’t even remember how 
old I was when I learned anything 
remotely resembling the recently 
disputed definitions of consent.

I knew I had learned about prac-

ticing safe sex. I remembered numer-
ous lectures about waiting until 
marriage. I vividly remembered 
learning biological processes respon-
sible for pregnancy. I recalled discus-
sions about “saying no,” but knowing 
a clear definition of what actually 
constitutes consent wasn’t apparent 
until I came to college — which is 
extremely problematic.

The issue of consent needs to be 

addressed far before students cross 
the threshold into their first dorm 
room on move-in day. Universities 
must be held responsible for ensur-
ing the continual education and 
safety of their students. In fact, Holly 
Rider-Milkovich, the director of the 
Sexual Assault and Prevention and 
Awareness Center, recently demon-
strated an excellent example of this 
by responding to an appeal from the 
Daily’s Editorial Board.

Arguing that the phrase “ ‘mutu-

ally understandable words or actions’ 
is too ambiguous” and that “the cur-
rent policy sets a dangerously low 

threshold for consent that can be 
misconstrued and misunderstood,” 
the editorial called for the elimi-
nation of inconsistency between 
SAPAC’s definition and the defini-
tion offered by the University’s Sex-
ual Misconduct Policy, and for more 
specificity in each definition. Rider-
Milkovich, responding to the request 
in a recent op-ed piece, notified both 
the Daily and campus at large of 
SAPAC’s actions to revise its defini-
tion to diminish the discrepancies.

However, despite the admirable 

receptiveness of institutions such as 
SAPAC, the knowledge offered by 
universities should act as a supple-
ment, rather than the foundation of a 
student’s knowledge.

The editorial also acknowledged 

the inadequacies of the University’s 
sex education programs. While cur-
rent initiatives may be beneficial 
and enlightening in some respects, 
assuming one or two programs during 
the first year or so of a student’s aca-
demic career is sufficient is a highly 
flawed preparation method. It’s like 
saying one doctor’s appointment is 
sufficient to ensure one’s health for a 
period of four years. Yet, college pro-
grams and initiatives aren’t meant to 
act as substitutes for information stu-
dents should have received when we 
were younger. They should be effec-
tive, continual enhancements to a 
knowledge base 
fostered early in 
our lives.

Just as dis-

crepancies exist 
between 
the 

University’s 
definitions 
of 

consent, 
incon-

sistencies within 
sexual education 
programs across 
the nation may 
further knowledge gaps and risk 
leaving students in precarious situa-
tions. A recent survey by the Public 
Religion Research Institute stated 
that “four in 10 millennials report 
that the sex education they received 
was not helpful.” To further illus-
trate the ineffectiveness of these pro-
grams, 37 percent of those surveyed 
claimed that “their education was 
‘not helpful’ in navigating decisions 
about sex and relationships.”

In an effort to explain why mil-

lennials feel underprepared, Debra 
Hauser, president of Advocates for 
Youth, highlights the variation of 
content taught in programs across 
the country. She stated: “Many 
were in school during a time when 
schools taught only abstinence. Oth-
ers may have received clinical infor-
mation about disease or pregnancy 
prevention, but few were provided 
the information young people truly 
need to traverse puberty, understand 
the difference between healthy and 
unhealthy relationships, develop a 
positive body image, make informed 

decisions, communicate effectively 
or navigate the health care system.”

Another critique was offered by 

Adam Tenner, executive director of 
Metro TeenAIDS, an AIDS-oriented 
community health organization, as 
he urged the idea school sex educa-
tion programs are far too delayed 
to be truly effective. In fact, a study 
conducted by the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics found 71 percent 
of Americans have sex before the age 
of 19 — suggesting that a majority of 
students may need to know about 
obtaining clear consent before even 
coming to college.

Rather, to ensure future genera-

tions — along with our own — fully 
understand the tenets of consent 
for sex as “sober, verbal and enthu-
siastic,” comprehensive sex educa-
tion must not remain confined to 
college or even high school class-
rooms. Age-appropriate education 
regarding consent should be taught 
throughout our lifetimes, beginning 
at childhood.

Our relationships — sexual or not 

— evolve over time and so too must 
our understanding of demonstrating 
respect for our friends, peers, class-
mates and our potential sexual part-
ners (especially considering these 
individuals may come from one of 
the previously mentioned groups). 
While I certainly don’t advocate 

exposing 
chil-

dren 
to 
inap-

propriate 
material, 
steps 

can be taken to 
shape children’s 
mindsets about 
consent in non-
explicit 
man-

ners, 
such 
as 

avoiding touch-
ing or hugging a 
friend 
without 

their permission, developing empa-
thy toward one another, stressing 
the importance of listening and 
respecting someone’s decision to say 
no, straying away from talking about 
individuals in an objectifying man-
ner or simply waiting to hear some-
one verbally and enthusiastically say 
“yes” before partaking in any poten-
tially uncomfortable activity.

We need to treat sexual encoun-

ters like any other interaction with 
those around us — with mutual 
respect, understanding, empathy 
and agreement. Consent must not 
remain an issue we solely view in 
hindsight. We need to correct the 
current state of consent education 
and extend it to younger generations 
who can assist in breaking the cycle 
of sexual assaults. These problem-
atic attitudes and behaviors must 
be corrected before they become an 
issue that can cause future emotion-
al and psychological harm.

Between the sheets

Continually teaching consent

MELISSA 
SCHOLKE

W

hen I was in high school, 
we all were required to 
take a health class that 

informed us of our 
changing 
bodies 

and what dangers 
lurked 
between 

the sheets when 
sleeping with oth-
ers. They threw 
some numbers at 
us, and all I can 
remember 
was 

thinking, 
“Wow, 

those odds of get-
ting ____ are so 
small!” That likelihood was never 
something I needed to worry about.

At that point, I was a naïve, young 

girl who didn’t know much about 
sex — let alone anyone who was 
“doing it.” The dangers seemed like 
some far-off mythical creature that 
could never be in my life, but it was 
at college that I realized just how 
often sex-related infections and life-
changing experiences could occur.

That was all people would talk 

about: sex and hookups. The whole 
“hook-up culture” consumed the 
lives of a bunch of horny freshmen 
who were glad that alcohol could 
make a lot of bad decisions happen 
very quickly. We knew about the 
basic dangers: sexually transmit-
ted infections, pregnancy and the 
emotional damage that came with 
getting busy with a lot of different 
people. But did that resonate with all 
people? No. And that’s why there are 
so many instances of STIs, especially 
on college campuses.

I have had the opportunity to meet 

people who have experienced STIs 

— those that are curable, and those 
that are not. For some people, it was 
something that had been a part of 
their lives for many years; for others, 
it was friends that had just recently 
found out. And from what I have seen 
and heard from those people, the 
stigma is the worst part.

There’s such a bad reputation 

that accompanies STIs — that you 
are some slut who played the num-
bers game, and of course you got a 
disease. It’s the look of disappoint-
ment in others’ eyes that solidifies 
the shame. Sex is something that 
every damn living organism does 
in some form, and somehow, we are 
constrained by the societal stan-
dards of when we should open our 
legs and for whom, and humiliated 
when we go outside of those lines. If 
we manage to get a disease? Well, of 
course it’s our fault.

Have you ever considered that 

there are other 
ways to contract 
STIs outside of 
having sex? Did 
you know you 
could have her-
pes your entire 
life due to it just 
being 
in 
your 

body? You could 
have contracted 
it in a sandbox 
when you were a child when some 
other kid with a cold sore touched 
the same Tonka truck that you did, 
and still never know to this day. What 
about a partner who lied? Say, a one-
night stand that would rather get it 
in than admit some dark truth. For 
some diseases, it’s a crime to know-

ingly have sex with someone if you 
have a contagious STI and do not 
inform them. What about if you get 
it from your partner, but you knew 
about it going into the relationship? 
Can you be OK with that decision 
down the road if you get the disease, 
or if you give it?

To the naïve girl back in high 

school who thought that her chances 
were pretty low, think again. It’s all 
around you. Because we are so scared 
to tell the world that we have a dis-
ease, it’s likely you’ll never actually 
know who has what. The person sit-
ting next to you could have just con-
quered chlamydia, or the guy behind 
you in line at a coffee shop could have 
just found out he has herpes. You 
never know. But we need to get rid 
of this notion of the blame game that 
comes with STIs. It isn’t necessarily 
the person’s fault, and we must be 
more sensitive to the issues.

The 
disap-

pointment 
in 

self; 
the 
fear 

of telling fam-
ily, friends and 
partners; 
and 

the worry about 
the future are 
things to which 
only those going 
through it can 
relate. By put-

ting extra societal blame on those 
who are either just finding out or are 
living with a sexually transmitted 
infection, it only makes the process 
of living that much more difficult.

Where is hoMe?

O

n April 7, the University’s Center for 
Campus Involvement announced it 
would cancel the screening of “Ameri-

can Sniper,” following a 
letter started by LSA sopho-
more 
Lamees 
Mekkaoui, 

raising concerns about the 
movie being shown at UMix. 
The CCI planned to resched-
ule the movie to a different 
location, followed by a panel 
and discussion.

The letter of concern 

regarding the movie has 
been framed as an initia-
tive from Middle Eastern 
and North African and Muslim students when 
more non-MENAS and non-Muslim students 
signed on than the former. Mekkaoui said, 
“This is the first time that I have personally 
seen a letter where it had students from Cen-
tral Student Government, students from Stu-
dents for Choice, Sikh Student Association, 
Muslim Student Association and Hillel all 
signed up to the same letter.”

Law student Rachel Jankowski created a 

petition calling for the movie to be played at 
UMix again, which stated, “If the University 
prevents a movie like this from being shown, it 
promotes intolerance and stifles dialogue and 
debate on the subject and goes directly against 
the atmosphere UMix purports to provide.”

UMix is a program that hosts events from 

10 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Friday nights for students 
who want somewhere to have alcohol-free 
fun. Considering that the movie was resched-
uled to a different venue with a panel and a 
discussion provided, it opened the way for 
more intellectual dialogue on the movie than 
in the UMix environment.

University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald com-

mented on the situation after the movie was 
rescheduled to be shown last Friday night at 
UMix. “I think ‘American Sniper’ didn’t quite 
fit this venue and this event,” Fitzgerald said. 
“But, having said that, we made the commit-
ment, we made that decision, and in the final 
analysis we needed to honor that decision that 
was made to show, and so tonight we have two 
movies.”

I question whether the 

University’s decision to 
honor this decision should 
take precedence over con-
cern for the safety of its 
own students.

When 
the 
University 

made the initial decision 
to remove the movie show-
ing from UMix, Mekkaoui 
was interviewed by mul-
tiple media outlets on what happened. How-
ever after the University changed its decision 
to show the movie at UMix, they did not per-
sonally inform Mekkaoui of the change. “If we 
had just written the letter and they said no that 
would be one thing,” Mekkaoui said, “but they 
made the decision and then pulled out the rug 
from under us.”

Despite the countless bias incident reports 

— reports to the University from community 
members about hate crimes — from Muslim 
and MENA students, the University has done 
little to address the effects of its decisions 
on the Muslim and MENA community. The 
only response to these bias incident reports 
was the e-mail sent out for students to give 
and expect respect, which was originally only 
going to include a general statement that stu-
dents should give and expect respect. It was 
only after MENA and Muslim students asked 

that they be mentioned was it stated explic-
itly. The University acted as if threats to 
students was not grounds for issuing a state-
ment. They acted as if it was not enough that 
DPSS made a student wait over an hour and 
a half for a response to verbal harassment. 
They acted as if it was not enough that there 
is clear evidence that Muslim and MENA stu-
dents are facing hate speech and threats to 
their physical safety.

Despite these incidents, the University 

has not addressed the fact that students 
have been accused of being anti-free speech, 
when the movie showing was moved to a dif-
ferent venue with a panel and a discussion 
after being cancelled from UMix. This forced 
these students to defend themselves. Mekka-
oui said, “They left it to one individual stu-
dent to deal with the media bombarding her 
and harassing her, and allowed her to get her 
name slandered in the media because they 
just didn’t issue a clarifying statement.”

This University has fostered a climate that 

is unsafe for Muslim and MENA students. On 
Friday night, the room screening “Padding-
ton” was mostly empty, and there was no pro-
test from students at the “American Sniper” 
showing. Amidst the verbal harassment and 
threats of violence, Muslim and MENA stu-
dents collectively decided that going to this 
movie showing would not be in the best inter-
ests of their safety. Allowing the students the 
opportunity to watch “Paddington” in a room 
where they could easily be found and targeted 
was clearly not in the best interests of these 
students. We have had to create methods to 
protect ourselves like creating safe spaces 
and a texting group for people that do not feel 
safe walking alone. Unlike for other students, 
the University is not protecting Muslim and 
MENA students.

As a Muslim student and columnist for The 

Michigan Daily, I have emphasized time and 
time again that I am writing from a perspec-
tive of an American Muslim in order to validate 
my claims. Today, I am writing both from the 
perspective of an American Muslim and as a 
Wolverine to validate that these communities 
are a part of my identity. I am just as much of an 

American as anyone who is 
a fan of the movie “Ameri-
can Sniper;” and I am just 
as much of a Wolverine as 
anyone else who is a part 
of this University. I have 
no other country to go to 
and no other University to 
call my own. I am tired of 
having to validate my feel-
ings and my identity, like 
after the three American-

Muslims — Deah, Yusor and Razan were killed. 
I related to their stories because they looked so 
much like me, and since this movie controversy, 
these feelings hit even closer to home.

I have to live with the repercussions of the 

University’s decision, as I do not have the lux-
ury of parting myself from this identity that 
holds so many stereotypes. They get to brush 
off the decision that they made as a “mistake” 
and move on while I have to live with an 
unsafe campus climate. I have to live with the 
media backlash. All because I am a Muslim.

I am asking the University to do the right 

thing and protect its students instead of shying 
away from its responsibilities. I am asking stu-
dents at this University to recognize that your 
fellow Wolverines are hurting.

I am a Wolverine, and this is my hoMe.

‘Dark Ages’ a strong 
debut from Levad

By KARL WILLIAMS

Daily Arts Writer

Sometimes poetry is funny. It 

doesn’t always hold the gravi-
tas and severity of “The Waste-
land” or “The 
Divine 
Com-

edy.” 
Shake-

speare 
wrote 

“King 
Lear,” 

but 
he 
made 

sex jokes, too. 
In fact, poetry 
is a remarkably 
flexible 
form, 

and the first 
collection 
of 

Megan Levad’s, assistant direc-
tor of the Helen Zell Writer’s 
Program 
at 
the 
University, 

evinces the form’s flexibility.

“Why We Live in the Dark 

Ages” is a skilled exposition of 
wit. In the collection, Levad 
reflects on topics from Marcel 
Proust to transubstantiation 
to Tycho Brahe to evolution. 
At times, the poems can’t even 
decide on a topic. Where we 
start and where we end up 
never seem to add up, so that a 
poem that starts off addressing 
the French Revolution ends up 
talking about Bill Clinton and 
St. Augustine.

Taking the form of didactic 

prose poems, her verse con-
stantly undermines the authori-
tative tone that most didactic 

poetry has. Take “Gravity,” 
for example: “Oh I don’t know 
anything about gravity.” That’s 
the whole poem. According to 
Hamlet, “Brevity is the soul of 
wit,” and Levad has learned this 
lesson well. While concerned 
with science, her poetry isn’t 
concerned with discovering sci-
entific knowledge. Her poems 
never arrive at an understand-
ing of science, but the epistemo-
logical limits of science.

The poems in “Why We Live 

in the Dark Ages” are hyperac-
tive, as if they were written by a 
professor on an Adderall binge. 
In some poems, Levad over-
loads the lines with informa-
tion, too much for the reader to 
fully assimilate it all. Ostensi-
bly, her poems reflect the prob-
lems of the digital age, where 
the excess of information and 
the speed of its delivery prevent 
its full understanding. We have 
information, but we are still 
bereft of knowledge.

For this reason, Levad pur-

ports, we live in the Dark Ages. 
The advancements in every sci-
entific discipline are immense, 
but no one other than a special-
ized class of scientists under-
stand how these work. Does 
anyone really understand all of 
the capabilities of an iPhone? 
We look upon our technol-
ogy with a reverence usually 
afforded to magic and have an 

absolute faith in its ability to do 
what we want.

One of the most impressive 

accomplishments 
in 
Levad’s 

debut collection is her abil-
ity to imitate the human voice. 
She transposes sound waves 
into ink, creating a poetic voice 
that is successfully comic and 
believable. Reflecting on colo-
nialism in her poem “Polio,” she 
writes: “Wow Belgium never 
gets shit for how badly they 
fucked up their colonies.” This 
idiom is refreshingly modern: 
you might hear it while walk-
ing down the street or sitting in 
Starbucks.

Levad’s voice remains coher-

ent throughout, as well, so that 
it reads as a series of essays as 
well as a collection of poems. 
The reader gets to see the keen 
machinations of Levad’s mind 
work from topic to topic upon 
all the various concerns of con-
temporary life.

In her first collection, Levad 

has shown a sharp intelligence 
and a remarkable ability to 
imitate modern vocalities and 
invent forms that mirror the 
hyperactivity of contemporary 
life. Her poetic voice reveals 
a talent that is both classically 
satirical 
and 
invigoratingly 

original.

Megan Levad will be reading 

her poetry at Literati Bookstore on 
April 20 at 7 p.m. Admission is free.

An ode to Circus 
and Millenium

A classic night in 
two rooms full of 

townies 

By FRANCESCA KIELB

Daily Arts Writer

“This should totally be a 

thing!” The girls around me gig-
gled while carelessly shimmying 
to a live cover of Backstreet Boys. 
It was moms’ weekend. A group 
of 15 girls hauled their mothers to 
Millennium Club/Circus Bar. The 
futuristic dance club on the main 
floor and campy circus-themed 
karaoke bar above is an ideal place 
to get drunk with your mom. A 
block past Main Street, this two-
story affair gives you the chance 
to run up and down between a 
space station with live music and 
a traveling circus where you make 
your own music.

It was difficult to determine 

which club was creepier, but it was 
nice to have options. Townies were 
everywhere, and the average age 
was about 10 years older than my 
fake claims I am.

Speaking of fakes, my friends 

and I had a brief scare when we 
saw a man in full FBI uniform 
lingering in the shadows. It 
wasn’t until he took the stage 
that we noticed he was seventy-
five, double-fisting Bud Lights 
and wearing a plastic badge. But 
God, his rendition of “Walk the 
Line” was spot on.

Seven Kamikaze shots later, my 

dad was on stage in a fedora sing-
ing “Twist and Shout,” (remember 
this was mothers’ weekend) and 
he was just a little too good at it. 
Six other girls looking for respite 
from their middle-aged counter-
parts descended the stairs with me 
to check out Millennium.

The club was full, and no one 

could stand still. The female vocal-
ist exuded a contagious energy. It 
infected me. For a few minutes, I 
could have cropped pink hair too. 
I could sing Pitbull’s “Fireball” 
and actually make it sound good. 
I could rap and most importantly 
I can dance.

There were no eyes of disap-

proval when we thrashed about the 
front row. I would have rushed the 
stage if I weren’t in awe of the lead 
singer. Her presence produced an 
aura of blasé raw positivity. If only 
I could stand close enough, maybe 

it’ll rub off.

The band announced a break, 

and I sprinted back upstairs to 
perform my duet to “Love in This 
Club.” Grabbing the mic, I pre-
tended like I didn’t need to read 
the words on the screen and tried 
to channel my inner girl-with-the-
pink-pixie-cut. I may not be paid 
anytime soon, but the rap could 
have been worse.

A few celebratory shots later, 

my friend grabbed my arm 
frantically. “Look! It’s her.” 
I turned around. It was Pink 
Pixie, in all her glory, at the 
end of the bar chatting with 
the bartenders. “Can we say 
something? What do we say? 
How do we say it?” We stood 
whispering and staring for a 
while, debating the next move.

A few months ago, I went to 

an Alex G concert in Detroit and 
was thrown into a similar situa-
tion. My friend and I had been 
standing in the crowd when 
Alex G walked out from back-
stage and stood with the audi-
ence. There were a few minutes 
when he was left undisturbed. A 
similar discussion of action had 
taken place then. In the end, I 
pussied out, and before I knew 
it, a petite blonde had swooped 
in. Not now. Not again. I would 
not miss my chance to stand in 
the aura.

I manned up and touched her 

arm. she turned. “I just want-
ed to say you were amazing 
tonight,” I said sheepishly. My 
friend nodded enthusiastically.

“Do you play here often?” I 

continued, fingers crossed.

“Yeah, 
thank 
you. 
I’m 

Michelle, we actually do play 

most Saturdays.”

“How long has your group 

been playing?”

“Awhile — we’re called the 

Killer Flamingos if you want to 
look up our schedule.”

“Wow, what a cool name,” my 

friend added, equally in awe.

“Let’s face it, it’s a shitty 

name,” she laughed. Of course, 
we agreed immediately. A few 
more 
passing 
compliments, 

and the casual exchange was 
over. But when my friend and I 
walked away we knew where we 
were going to be next Saturday.

Our group closed the place. 

When we stumbled back into 
our beds, our refrain repeated, 
“We NEED to do this again. 
Let’s make this a thing, please?”

But maybe it was special 

because it wasn’t a thing. 
Because 
for 
one 
night 
we 

weren’t focused on impressing 
peers: on social status, stand-
ing or “politics”. Because our 
moms were getting hit on more 
than we were. Because when I 
danced I wasn’t trying to envi-
sion how I looked to the men 
around me, because the men 
around me were more inter-
ested in the other men around 
me than in me. Because other 
people didn’t define the success 
of the night, because happiness 
was not defined by connections 
made or opportunities lost.

The next morning, my friend 

texted me. “Let’s memorize the 
words to ‘Dilemma’ now so we 
can sing it next time.” Please, for 
my sake, don’t go this Saturday. 
Please don’t make this a thing. 
Because I’m having way too 
much fun to see anyone I know.

Captivated by Milky 
Chance’s raw ‘Dance’

By CLAIRE WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

I was lying in bed one Satur-

day evening, sipping a steaming 
Herbal Essentials — Minty Sprig 
out of a South Quad paper din-
ing hall cup and pondering all 
the homework I hadn’t gotten to, 
when it came on Spotify Radio. 
It had a distinct allure — light 
tapping, guitar chords with a 
gentle rhythmic emphasis that 
bred a peculiar intrigue. “I want 
you by my side, so that I never 
feel alone again.” It’s a sad song 
— I could hear it in the first line, 
the resigned heartbreak in each 
word. “We need to fetch back the 
time they have stolen from us.” 
His voice was rusty, like an old 
car that has been in the family 
for years. It had a comforting, 
crusty familiarity, and I knew 
his words were genuine. This 
authenticity made the content 
intensely poignant, and with 
each line I secretly hoped the 
lost love he sang of would return.

The song grew more won-

drous the more I pondered it. I 
assumed he sang of heartbreak, 
but the storyline itself was left 
hazy and ambiguous. Maybe he 
sang of a woman who had left 
him. Maybe he sang of a love 
with whom he could no longer 
be. I wondered who she was, 
why she had left and who had 
taken her. It was an elegant, 
beautiful sort of enigma that 

sucked me in headfirst.

Curiosity got the better of me: 

I googled it. “Milky Chance Sto-
len Dance lyrics meaning” blink-
ed on the screen as I searched for 
the story in the artist’s words. I 
clicked on a link to genius.com, 
and to my dismay, I was greet-
ed with a morbid explanation: 
“The song concerns the narra-
tor’s drug habit, his separation 
from taking them, and his desire 
to take them once more.” I was 
disillusioned the more I read. 
The intense romance wielded 
in the simplicity of “I want you” 
degraded into a blunt personifi-
cation of substance. The singer’s 
“pain, caused by the absence of 
you” that had burned with fiery 
heartache turned into sickly 
withdrawal. I was taken in by 
this cynical analysis, watch-

ing as dreams of tragic lost 
love melted into the sinkhole of 
addiction.

“Stolen Dance” is a beautiful 

song. The light drums, rhyth-
mic strums and genuine vocals 
still captivate me in ways most 
other pieces never have. But 
at the same time, some of the 
allure has faded. The drug inter-
pretation isn’t the only one; 
many online sources actually 
disagree with this viewpoint on 
the song’s meaning, and sport 
their own thoughts. Regardless, 
these deep analyses and explica-
tions destroy a sense of mystery 
that had hitherto intrigued me. 
I want to wonder — to ponder 
the identity of “you” and the 
story the words trace out. There 
is something magical about the 
unknown and it’s enchanting.

Why We 
Live in the 
Dark Ages

‘Ongoingness’ is 88 
pages of adult life

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

“Ongoingness: 
The 
End 

of a Diary” reads like Sarah 
Manguso sat down and wrote 
it in one go. 
It flows like 
88 
pages 
of 

an 
unedited 

stream 
of 

consciousness, 
but it doesn’t 
feel 
like 
88 

pages. 
It’s 

not 
a 
linear 

story; 
there’s 

no beginning 
and there’s no end. It’s not 
circular; 
her 
final 
words 

don’t neatly wrap up with a 
callback introduced in the first 
five pages. Manguso crafts a 
narrative with sparse prose that 
reads like poetry which drops 
you in the middle and leaves 
you there — lost in the same 
“ongoingness” 
she 
brilliant 

articulates between the covers.

“Ongoingness” is the story 

of Manguso’s obsession with 
creating an authentic record 
of her life, an obsession that 
culminated in an 800,000-word 
long diary spanning every day 
of the past 25 years. She writes 
about her preoccupation with 
documenting not the important 
events she experiences, but 
those precious moments in 
between them that fill up the 
vast majority of our lives.

Manguso, 
while 
writing 

about writing, captures the 
frustration of the inability to 
describe what you’re feeling, 
to be limited by language. 
Letters 
and 
syllables 
and 

words 
themselves 
create 
a 

barrier between emotion and 
communication. And even if 
you spend 25 years choosing 
your words, they’ll never be 
perfect, and that barrier will 
still stand. She has a gift for 
frankly relating truths about 
the limitations of language. 
These truths seem like they 
should be too complicated and 
bittersweet to be captured in 
staccato sentences, but they’re 
not.

Though Manguso’s sentences 

are short, they call to mind the 
vivid image of a pen running 
across a page, frantically trying 
to keep up with the thoughts 
that drive it. Her panic is 
palpable — “Even cognizant of 

the passing of time that doesn’t 
stop it from happening.” Words 
that fall from lips are already 
obsolete; sentences scribbled 
on paper ossify before the ink 
is dry.

The problem of ongoingness, 

Manguso observes, is that even 
as we contemplate time, we 
watch it run away from us. We 
grasp at and fixate on special 
moments — the glory days, 
the turning points, the game-
changers, whatever you want 
to call them — to try to keep 
ourselves grounded.

Manguso tells us she was 

fixated 
on 
every 
moment, 

terrified to lose a single one.

And then, almost exactly 

halfway 
through 
the 
book, 

Manguso writes about becoming 
pregnant and then a mother. 
During the first 18 months of 
having a son, she begins to 
“inhabit time differently.” Her 
relationship with her diary 
permanently changes: though 
she keeps writing in it, she no 
longer worries about losing 
memories. Her diary entries 
become terse, including facts 
without introspection; “Things 
were just themselves.”

Becoming a mother releases 

Manguso from her compulsive 
recording and teaches her how 
to be aware of time’s passing 
without 
being 
hopelessly 

paralyzed by it.

Are any of us more than the 

sum of our memories — both 
our own and those that others 
possess of us? What happens 
when we are the only ones 
left to carry the memory of 
someone else? Can 800,000 
words over 25 years capture the 
experiences and the emotions 
that happened in them? Which 
contain the most truth about a 
person — the things that change 
about them, or the things that 
stay the same?

Manguso 
doesn’t 
offer 

answers to these questions, 

only honest observations about 
the Herculean effort it takes 
to recognize the reality about 
human significance:

“For just a moment, with 

great effort, I could imagine 
my will as a force that would 
not disappear but redistribute 
when I died, and that all life 
contained the same force, and 
that I needn’t worry about my 
impending death because the 
great responsibility of my life 
was to contain the force for a 
while and then relinquish it. 
Then the moment would pass, 
and I’d return to brooding about 
my lost memories,” she writes.

Hackneyed 
poetic 
themes 

are refreshed in Manguso’s 
words; she describes running 
out of time as a privilege and 
forgotten moments as the price 
we pay for living a full life. She 
breaks with the writing gods — 
you know, the ones you learn 
to worship in undergraduate 
English programs — as she 
oscillates between showing and 
telling, which would feel like a 
gimmick if it weren’t for the lack 
of pretentious self-indulgence. 
Her writing is poetic, but never 
preachy. She’s not boasting 
about possessing any intimacy 
with life’s secrets.

“Ongoingness: 
The 
End 

of a Diary” isn’t spiritual or 
moralistic, though it does leave 
you in a bit of an existential 
crisis, wandering the halls in 
search of a friend to tell you 
that life is in fact worth living 
despite everything. But even if 
that friend isn’t very reassuring 
(Rebecca) you’re able to work 
through it, because you know 
now that life is ongoing, and 
we are all just inhabiting time 
for the brief amount we’ve been 
allotted. So make the best of 
it — or don’t. Manguso doesn’t 
really care either way. The book 
isn’t about you. It isn’t even 
really about her or her son or 
those 800,000 words and the 25 
years they freeze in time.

“Look 
at 
me,” 
she 
says 

towards the end, “dancing my 
little dance for a few moments 
against

“Ongoingness” 
is

that dance and how to make it

to figure that out for him or 
herself, reading this book could 
guide the first few steps.

O

n the first day of Eng-
lish Prof. Jeremiah 
Chamberlin’s Rust Belt 

Narratives class, we brain-
stormed ideas that we felt were 
representa-
tive of Rust 
Belt cities 
like Detroit.

“Blight,” 

someone said. 
“Industry.” 
“Factories.” 
“Economic 
downfall.” 
“Choice.” 
“Hope.”

Then 
someone 
raised 
a 

hand and said, “The Rust Belt 
narrative is a discourse of those 
who stay versus those who go.”

Those who stay versus those 

who go.

As a senior about to graduate 

in May, I have thought about 
that notion over and over again, 
tumbling the idea in my head 
like it a stone I’m determined 
to polish. Do I move to Detroit 
and remain in Michigan, or do 
I leave to pursue opportunity 
elsewhere? If I leave, am I a 
total hack for spending half my 
college career preaching about 
the great rising of the city down 
the road?

I ask myself these questions 

every day, especially on days 
when I’m reporting. I sit down 
and 
chat 
with 
passionate 

business 
owners, 
exuberant 

artists, witty writers, and their 
love for the city drips off of 
their words. In Detroit, Tyree 
Guyton works away at his 
inextinguishable 
Heidelberg 

project, while a University of 
Michigan student sits in a small 
desk at Woodbridge Community 
center, teaching an elementary 
schooler 
‘Twinkle 
Twinkle 

Little Star’ on the cello. A group 
of writers gives houses to other 
writers, and in one 90-year-
old’s backyard, he’s built a 
towering structure of found 
objects that he lovingly refers to 
as “Disneyland.” A docent at the 
Motown Museum gives her best 
rendition of Diana Ross, and a 
photographer snaps photos of a 
city he’s captured for more than 
80 years.

At the end of the day, I drive 

my car down Woodward Avenue 
and watch the skyline shrink in 
the rearview mirror.

My grandmother was born 

in Detroit on February 5, 1928, 
and she grew up on Longfellow 
Avenue in Boston Edison. My 
grandfather grew up a few 
blocks away in Highland Park. 
They were from two utterly 
different worlds: she was the 
daughter of a wealthy business 
owner, and he the son of an 
autoworker. I imagine them 
sneaking out of their houses 
at night and rendezvousing in 
Voigt park, laying in the grass 
and talking about their future 
together — a future that would 
eventually lead to me. I drive 
by her house and think about 
what she must have looked like 
in her 20s, skipping up the walk 
in a striped ’50s dress that she’s 
wearing in the photos I have 
tacked to my wall, the Cadillac 
she’s leaning against parked in 
the drive.

My grandmother died on 

Sept. 7, 2011 while walking the 
Detroit River Walk with my 
grandpa. It was a beautiful day, 
and she was happy until the 
moment she got a headache, 

sat down and had a stroke. She 
was brain dead within a minute, 
closing her eyes after one last 
look at the river and the city 
she loved. A silver bench near 
the carousel has her name on it 
now.

The day I found out I’d be 

moving to Washington D.C., I 
visited her. I sat on the bench 
next to the plaque inscribed 
with the name we share and 
I told her I’d be going, and I 
didn’t know when I’d be coming 
back. I will come back, I said 
aloud. To her, to the skyline, 
to the Renaissance Center that 
was casting me in shadow as 
the sun set. I will come back.

“If you’re so good, then why 

are you still here?”

That’s the Rust Belt question. 

Businesses close with signs that 
read “No Opportunity Here” 
and we graduate with the idea 
that leaving the state signifies 
“making it.” A story published 
in The New York Times shows 
the percent change in young 
people over more than a decade, 
by city. At the very bottom 
is Detroit with ten percent 
less young people over time. 
People are leaving, the great 
migration in rapid reverse. I am 
contributing to that percentage.

Yet, when I go to Detroit, 

that’s not the reality I see. I 
see people opening businesses 
instead of closing them, people 
turning 
ruin 
into 
creation, 

rebuilding, rising. I see the 
aftermath of the Great Fire 
of 1805, a city of people who 
fought to put the fire out and 
use the last ember to spark 
ideas for the future. We hope 
for better things. It shall arise 
from the ashes.

But I won’t be around to see 

it rise. I won’t be around to 
see it contribute to the upward 
mobility of a city that a Google 
search brings up terms like 
“slums” 
and 
“abandoned.” 

Most of us won’t be. We’ll come 
back to a bustling metropolis 
in 10 or 20 years and be able 
to muse to one another about 
the “Detroit we once knew” or 
the “way things used to be.” 
Old abandoned factories will 
be expensive flats and the city 
will be layered with remnants 
of its boom in the ’20s, buried 
under the rubble of the early 
2000s, polished and presented 
in the future as a kind of urban 
renewal. This palimpsest will 
become such a salient part of 
Detroit that it will be a selling 
point – an entire city that serves 
as an interactive museum of 
layered artifacts around every 
corner.

There is value in leaving, 

in seeing the rest of the world 
outside of the Rust Belt and 
exploring opportunities that 
may not be attainable here. 
There is value in gathering this 
experience and then making the 
active choice to return to the 

city instead of passively staying. 
The Rust Belt has taught us 
the 
value 
of 
determination 

and tenacity that easier places 
may not have cultivated in its 
people. This tenacity will carry 
us to pursue great opportunity 
elsewhere, but this tenacity will 
lead us back to where we began.

The Rust Belt narrative may 

be a discourse of those who stay 
versus those who go, but there 
are also those who return. We 
can leave and come back better 
than before. If anything, that’s 
the Rust Belt narrative: it’s the 
story of the comeback.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Put down this paper 
and listen to Alex G 

By RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Writer

I’ve said it before, I’m saying 

it now, and I’ll probably say it a 
few more times: everyone needs 
to listen to Alex G. I wrote an 
article about his show in Detroit 
a couple months ago and includ-
ed him in my 2014 “best of” list. 
Now, here I am again, writing 
about him again. I’ve already 
apologized to my editors for my 
obsessive tendencies but remain 
steadfast in my efforts to inform 
everyone about G.

So, I’ll give you a little recap 

of the dude (in case you forgot 
to read my other articles.) Alex 
Giannascoli is a 22-year-old 
D.I.Y. indie rocker from Philly 
who studied at Temple Uni-
versity and recorded his songs 
from the comfort of his dorm 
room, which he uploaded to 
his Bandcamp profile. I called 
him the “Internet’s best-kept 
secret,” and I meant it. He accu-
mulated a small following with-
in the crevices of the web but 
flew relatively under the radar 
until last year.

With the debut of his first 

studio-album, DSU, he earned 
approval from music authorities 
like Pitchfork, who crowned 
him the lo-fi king and best new 
bedroom 
singer/songwriter 

(I’m paraphrasing, but you get 
the point). The album deals with 
youth and growing up and all 
the shitty stuff that comes with 
it. The lyrics are subtly poetic, 
the vocals dark and dreamy, the 
guitar riffs volatile. If Elliott 
Smith and Built to Spill went 
on a few dates and then fucked, 

their lovechild would be Alex G. 
It’s damn good.

You know what else is damn 

good? His stuff on Bandcamp. 
So good that, to my dismay, his 
label took two full LPs down to 
remaster and re-release after he 
started getting attention. Like 
seriously, one day they just dis-
appeared off the Internet. And 
on that day, many tears were 
shed because Trick and Rules 
feature some of G’s best mate-
rial. They read much like DSU 
in length and theme, follow-
ing the same sort of adolescent 
narrative 
in 
approximately 

13-16 songs. Though short, the 
tracks offer bursts of emotion 
– sometimes raw and melan-
cholic, other times soft and 
tender. They’re rough around 
the edges, a bit bitter upon first 

bite, but let them play for a few 
minutes and you’ll start to like 
the taste.

And now they’re back up on 

Bandcamp, as well as iTunes 
and Spotify. To be honest, I 
can’t really tell that they’ve been 
remastered, but maybe that’s 
just because I didn’t mind how 
they sounded before. Trick, 
in particular, rivals all of G’s 
other efforts, including DSU, 
despite being recorded a few 
years before. From the opening 
track, “Memory,” to the closing, 
“Clouds,” the album feels like 
an intimate look into your own 
life. G’s words feel like abstract 
entries in your own diary.

So if you don’t put on a fuck-

ing Alex G song after you’re done 
skimming this article, so help 
me God. But seriously, go listen.

‘M’ looks for another 
win in lopsided rivalry

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

Michiganders agree on many 

things. 
There’s 
widespread 

acclaim over Euchre and drinking 
Vernors when 
you’re 
sick. 

But 
there 
is 

one 
question 

that 
divides 

the state more 
than anything 
else: Michigan 
or 
Michigan 

State?

Michigan 

softball coach 
Carol Hutchins 
was 
born 
in 

Lansing 
and 

played 
for 

Michigan 
State. But she will give you a 
straight and short answer to the 
question.

“I’m not really caught up in the 

rivalry,” Hutchins said. “I know 
Michigan fans don’t like to hear 
that. To me, I only care about 
Michigan. I work for Michigan, 
my team is Michigan, and I want 
Michigan to win. And I don’t care 
who we’re playing.”

Wednesday, the fourth-ranked 

Wolverines (10-2 Big Ten, 37-6 
overall) will head to East Lansing 
to play the Spartans (1-11, 16-24). 
The Spartans haven’t given the 
Wolverines much of a challenge 
historically, as Michigan leads 
the 
all-time 
series, 
82-27. 

Michigan State’s last win came 
in 2009.

Despite Michigan’s consistent 

success against Michigan State, 
junior second baseman Sierra 
Romero said the rivalry hasn’t 
become any less competitive.

“(The rivalry) is kind of like 

the Ohio State one,” Romero said. 
“We go out there with that kind 
of chip on our shoulder that it’s 
a rivalry game, and that makes it 

all the more fun. Other than that, 
it’s just another game.”

Added 
sophomore 
pitcher 

Megan Betsa: “If you asked me, 
I don’t think they’re our biggest 
rival. It’s always fun to play an 
in-state rival, but we just play the 
same regardless. We don’t play 
who’s across the chest.”

Betsa said that a team like 

Minnesota may be more of a 
rival than Michigan State. And 
there’s something to that. While 
Michigan and Minnesota occupy 
the top two slots in the Big Ten 
standings, Wednesday’s matchup 
will be a battle of worst versus 
first in the Big Ten.

Michigan State has the worst 

batting average in the conference 
(.274) and has a team earned-run 
average of 5.13. The Wolverines 
maintain the best ERA in the Big 
Ten with a 1.65 mark and have a 
whopping 60 more home runs 
than their in-state foe.

With Michigan being the 

Spartans’ first ranked opponent 
of the season, they’ll face an 
uphill battle trying to pull off 
an upset. Leading the charge 
will be starting pitcher Kristina 

Zalewski, who is sixth in the 
conference with a 3.15 ERA. 
Zalewski has 117 strikeouts and 
12 wins, and she will likely be the 
Wolverines’ biggest challenge on 
Wednesday.

No matter the statistics, the 

rivalry still has meaning. Both 
teams want to boast bragging 
rights for softball supremacy in 
the state.

“I’ve 
always 
grown 
up 

knowing about the Michigan 
State/Michigan rivalry,” said 
junior 
right 
fielder 
Kelsey 

Susalla. “It’s always a fun game 
for us because it is a rivalry 
game, but it’s just a matter of 
how we play and focusing on our 
game.”

If the Wolverines stay focused, 

they should have no problem 
beating the Spartans. As for 
the always-focused Hutchins, 
her players know where her 
allegiance lies in the rivalry.

“Her 
heart 
bleeds 
blue,” 

Susalla said.

Added sophomore shortstop 

Abby Ramirez: “She’s definitely a 
Michigan woman now.”

And that can’t be debated.

Jazz legends to 
perform at Hill

Hancock and Corea 
prepare an acoustic 

piano set

By COSMO PAPPAS

Daily Arts Writer

The last time jazz titans Chick 

Corea 
and 
Herbie 
Hancock 

performed at Hill Auditorium 
would have been Jan. 26, 1978 , 
but winter conditions kept the duo 
from 
flying 

out of New 
York 
and, 

memorably, 
closed 
the 

University 
for the last 
time 
until 

2014. 
The 

rescheduled 
concert, set a 
month 
after 

the first date, 
featured 
Miles Davis’s two former sidemen 
— and by this time widely 
renowned jazz musicians in their 
own right — in an intimate setting, 
pared down to two acoustic pianos. 
They elected such a performance 
just as they were fully immersed 
in the electronic experimentation 
of jazz fusion that defined the late 
’60s and ’70s.

It will be one of the most 

significant events UMS puts on 
this year as Ann Arbor welcomes 
the pair back for a performance 
that will feature the two pianists 
with just acoustic instruments 
between them on the famous Hill 
stage. For two careers that have 

been defined by groundbreaking 
experiments in electronic media 
and forms in jazz, it’s a special 
opportunity to see Corea and 
Hancock going back to basics.

“(The piano) is the instrument 

that they have gone through their 
career with and that has gotten 
them to this point,” said University 
alum 
Brendan 
Asante, 
who 

graduated from the University 
School of Music, Theatre and 
Dance program in Jazz and served 
as a former ticket associate for 
the University Musical Society. 
“From a foundational perspective, 
it signifies a lot of home-growing 
and ‘this is where we started.’ ”

Audiences can expect a concert 

both historic and historical. It’s a 
big deal any time famous musicians 
perform 
in 
their 
hometown. 

But this concert will, further, be 
historical because Hancock and 
Corea themselves embody the 
history of avant-garde jazz since 
the early 1960s. Herbie Hancock 
and Chick Corea are “two of the 
major jazz piano voices to emerge 
in the post-Coltrane era” along 
with McCoy Tyner and Keith 
Jarrett, as Don Heckman of the 
Los Angeles Times describes.

“I think that these two phenoms 

of the piano ... are joining forces 
to try to present a history – their 
playing styles and everything. 
They’re trying to present that in a 
duo format,” Asante said.

As Harvard Prof. Homi K. 

Bhabba says in his introduction to 
Hancock’s lecture, “The Ethics of 
Jazz” through the Norton Lectures 
series at Harvard University, “In 
the musical field alone, (Hancock) 
has ventured from post-bop to 

hip-hop, funk to film soundtracks, 
Miles Davis to Joni Mitchell, Lang 
Lang to P!nk.”

Hancock has also championed 

jazz in his humanitarian career as 
a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador. 
Professor 
Bhabba 
develops 

Hancock’s view on the politics or 
ethics of jazz that play out in “the 
disjunctive terrains of a world that 
is in some aspects synchronized 
and 
simultaneous, 
while 
in 

other respects, dramatically out 
of sync with itself and others.” 
He 
emphasizes 
the 
“mutual 

cooperation” that, in Hancock’s 
ethics of jazz, allows musicians 
to “respect (their) neighbors” by 
“(working) and (playing) with 
them.”

Chick Corea’s career in music 

is no less illustrious as we track 
his involvement with Miles Davis 
for the latter’s foundational fusion 
albums Bitches Brew and In a 
Silent Way, his tenure with the 
fusion group Return to Forever 
and his work in classical music 
and Latin American music. Chick 
Corea is the fourth-most Grammy 
nominated artist of all time, 
counting 63 separate nominations, 
as well as an unprecedented 
trove of three “Best Instrumental 
Album” Latin Grammy awards.

Hancock 
and 
Corea’s 

performance this Thursday will 
animate a history of more than 
half a century of jazz, an expansive 
archive of the “idiom of jazz” 
(Asante’s phrase) unfolding in 
real time for Ann Arbor audiences 
through Corea and Hancock’s 
unquestionable historical import.

“We’ll let you down as soon as you make us look cool.”
Riding in cars with 
moms ... and Bono

By REGAN DETWILER

Daily Arts Writer

After meeting people I’ve 

never met before, trying things 
I’ve never tried before, study-
ing things I’ve never studied 
before, and having had pretty 
much every preconception I 
carried with me to the Univer-
sity challenged, freshman year 
has given me a lot to reflect on. 
This is what I thought of as my 
mom and I drove for the ump-
teenth time down Route 23 back 
to Columbus (yes, I’m from 
Columbus) listening to The 
Unforgettable Fire.

Although it was my first time 

driving home from Ann Arbor for 

Easter weekend, my grandparents 
have always lived in Perrysburg, 
just south of Toledo. As a result, 
we have made the trek south-
east to Columbus countless times 
throughout my life. The wide, 
open, flat fields of corn and soy-
beans have seen me through baby-
hood, toddlerhood and childhood. 
They’d seen me as a lost middle 
schooler, a high schooler way too 
preoccupied with extracurricular 
activities and GPAs, and now an 
Ann Arbor-fied college student. 
We’d been through a lot together.

This time when we drove down 

23, the clouds were that lovely, 
swimming blue-gray as an April 
storm settled over the strikingly 
unassuming landscape of the bud-

ding fields, punctuated by darkly 
beautiful dilapidated farmhouses 
and barns. My mom’s new Volvo 
sedan was not yet set up with an 
aux cord, so we were left to the 
basket of CDs she brought for the 
three-hour drive.

We listened to late ’80s to early 

’90s Tanita Tikaram on the way 
out of Ann Arbor, and it was time 
to pick something new as we got 
on the highway. The Best of the Girl 
Groups, Vol. 1, Tanita Tikaram, Van 
Morrison and several of my mom’s 
favorite U2 albums … Who did we 
feel like listening to?

I know people have strong opin-

ions about U2 and what they have 
done with recent releases, but it 
has been my mom’s favorite band 

for almost 30 years. That’s a long 
time. My mom would play U2 
around the house while she made 
dinner, while she cleaned and 
fixed up the house, while we sat 
out on the front porch in the sum-
mers and all the time in the car, 
whether it’s a five-minute drive 
to the grocery store or sprinkled 
over eight hours on the way to 
D.C. to see the band in concert. 
I’ve listened to the band’s music 
mindlessly for pretty much my 
entire life, and eventually came to 
know their entire collection with-
out realizing it. Over the years 
my mom would rewind the songs 
and make me listen to her favor-
ite lines and we would play over 
and over again those parts of their 
songs where Bono’s ever-clear 
voice slips into that gristly, splin-
tery growl.

“I want to listen to U2,” I said. 

My mom said that was good 
with her, and then I asked which 
album we should put in. Shuf-
fling through them, I landed on 
one that she had raved about and 
I knew was legendary. I asked, 
“Are you okay with The Unforget-
table Fire?”

“Oh, Regan, I’m always okay 

with The Unforgettable Fire,” 
she replied.

I had heard the album before 

piece by piece. My mom would 
play certain songs she loved, 
playing a song’s regular version 
and a live version one right after 
the other, or two songs on the 
album together that blend into 
one another seamlessly. But I had 
never listened to The Unforget-
table Fire all the way through, 
uninterrupted. My mom calling 
it “required listening,” so I knew 
listening to this album was some-
thing that had to be done.

The Edge’s distinctive guitar 

welcomed us to the long highway 
drive as “A Sort of Homecoming” 

trickled through the speakers – an 
all-too-appropriate opening song.

And then it was the two of us, 

the open road and our dog, Lucy, in 
the backseat. Classic, right? It was 
perfect. We passed by our favorite 
billboard for Beef Jerky Unlimit-
ed, stopped to pee at a McDonald’s 
in North Baltimore, “the armpit 
of Ohio,” as my mom calls it, and 
commented on the exquisitely 
uncomplicated landscape of the 
Midwest. We admired the way the 
overcast lighting brought out the 
contrast between all of the colors 
– the bright green budding fields, 
the golden brown of the ones that 
hadn’t yet recovered from winter 
and the bright red-shelled semi 
trucks we shared the road with.

After the firm and quick beats 

of the album’s title track echoed 
through our ears, hearts and 
minds, the album settled into 
the contemplative, “Promenade,” 
which flowed beautifully, like 
water into “4th of July” – the 
heady, wordless predecessor of 
The Unforgettable Fire’s master-
piece, “Bad.”

It’s a song that we’ve listened 

to countless times, giving it both 
bouts of silence and our best Bono 
impressions belted out when the 
song deserved it. We both looked 
forward at the patch of gray 
highway immediately in front of 
our car as it continuously raced 
underneath us. The same not-yet-
stormy, but already heavy and 
foreboding blue-gray swarms of 
vapor hanging above us as if they 
had some kind of awareness of 
what they were witnessing. This 
time, almost impishly, The Edge 
drew us into the song, remind-
ing me of my presence here with 
my mom, listening to her favor-
ite band and giving her favorite 
album of all time the respect it 
beckoned for.

The thing about “Bad” is that 

it starts out mellow and smooth. 
Only “The Edge” is playing. But 
then comes a distant tambourine, 
then Bono singing gently, then 
the bass and drums, and soon the 
song gains a sort of pulse. The 
song builds, the cymbals pick up 
and the lyrics move into “this 
desperation, dislocation, separa-
tion, condemnation, revelation, in 
temptation, isolation desolation … 
Let it go … and so to find away…”

Then Bono’s voice cracks into 

that gristly, painfully organic 
growl as he iterates, “I’m wide 
awake … I’m wide awake …” with 
this certain vitality that reminds 
you of all it is to be human. Almost 
suddenly, just as the song has built 
to this, the cymbals fade out, the 
song slows, and soon we’re left 
again with just Bono, “The Edge,” 
my mom and I. “I’m not sleep-
ing…” and the music leaves our 
ears to tire on concrete.

What does it mean to listen to 

your parents’ favorite music – to 
really listen to it, to really give it 
your attention? I see it as a form 
of empathy. Listening to my moth-
er’s music was to put myself in her 
shoes and to experience humanity 
as she experiences it. It’s to rec-
ognize something that speaks to 
her, and by extension to recognize 
something that has contributed 
to who I am. And we were doing 
it together, here, on the road we’d 
travelled so many times – just me 
my mom (and yes, Lucy).

The band that does this for you 

may not be U2, and if you’re not a 
U2 fan, then I’m sorry you’ve had 
to endure my ranting all the way 
up to 1000 words. But if your par-
ents have an affinity for music, 
you should take a look at their col-
lection if you haven’t already. Ask 
what their favorite album is, and 
don’t go to iTunes – get the CD. Go 
out to the car and go for a drive. 
And listen.

From afar: Bastien’s success a family affair

By MATTHEW KIPNIS

Daily Sports Writer

Not once did Gary Bastien ask 

his son to follow in his footsteps.

Gary didn’t hang up decathlon 

trophies or jerseys from his days 
at the U.S. Olympic trials around 
the house. At no point did he brag 
about stories from the glory days. 
And he certainly never pushed 
his son, Steven, to be an athlete, 
run track or compete in the same 
event he did.

It just happened that way.
Steven, a junior at Michigan, 

didn’t start running to chase 
his father’s records, and he was 
always reminded that it wasn’t 
something he had to do. He did 
it because it was something he 
loved to do.

“He loves the sport in a 

different way than I do,” Gary 
said. “He is able to really have 
a perspective where this is fun 
for him, where I used to wrap 
my whole identity into my 
performance.”

Despite two career paths that 

feature almost identical skillsets, 
personal records and techniques, 
it has been the younger Bastien’s 
ability to love what he does and 
stay positive that has separated 
him from his father and the rest 
of the pack.

* * *

It was an ordinary day in 

Saline, Michigan when Gary 
Bastien realized that his son could 
be a star athlete. He was washing 
dishes as the neighborhood kids 
were playing on the backyard 
trampoline trying to dunk a Nerf 
ball into a hoop.

As he looked out the window, 

he could see the kids competing, 
trying to nail the perfect dunk. 
Soon, Gary looked up to see a 
five-year-old Steven fly into the 
air, do a front flip and dunk the 
ball with ease. As the other kids 
were jumping four feet away 
from the hoop, according to 
the elder Bastien, Steven was 

jumping from 14 feet.

“I remember thinking, ‘I don’t 

think I could have done that in 
my prime,’ and he was five,” Gary 
said. “It gets your attention as 
someone who was an athlete like 
I was.”

But Steven was just messing 

around with his friends. As 
always, he was just having fun.

* * *

When it came to track, Gary 

was hesitant to push Steven in 
the beginning. After the elder 
Bastien graduated from Eastern 
Michigan, he moved to Auburn, 
Alabama and saw fathers who 
came to every practice and stood 
behind their sons’ shoulders, 
telling them what to do. He didn’t 
want to become a helicopter 
father who forced his son to do 
what he did.

“I always told him, ‘You don’t 

have to do this,’ ” Gary said. “ 
‘Just because I did it doesn’t 
mean you have to match me or 
try to chase that. Do what you 
want to do.’ He just had a lot of 
natural inclination to want to do 
this stuff.”

Steven had a variety of sports to 

choose from — he played pickup 
basketball 
in 
the 
neighbors’ 

driveways and baseball with his 
uncle, a Michigan State graduate 
who played with former World 
Series hero Kirk Gibson. But he 
chose the same path and sport as 
his father. He even competed in 
the same event — the heptathlon.

“I definitely followed in his 

footsteps, but it wasn’t that I 
needed to do what Dad did,” 
Bastien said. “It just happened.”

As Steven approached middle 

school, he joined the Ann Arbor 
track club. Like his days playing 
in the backyard, it was mostly 
recreational. Most days, the team 
played capture the flag on the 
inside of the track, which would 
be its running workout for the 
day.

Even in high school, it was 

still just about the fun. As a 

freshman, Steven was small 
for his age — standing around 
5-foot-1, weighing 95 pounds — 
and his father had to warn him 
that there was a chance he might 
not grow any more. That didn’t 
deter Steven, as he maintained 
the belief that he could catch up 
to the competition.

“My dad always told me, ‘You 

will get faster one day. That’s 
what happened to me and both 
your uncles,’ ” Steven said. “I 
just believed it. I always told my 
friends that were faster than me, 
‘I am going to be just as fast as 
you,’ and they didn’t believe me. 
But it ended up happening.”

Eventually Steven, like his 

uncles and father, blossomed into 
an elite athlete and came into 
his own. As soon as he started 
to hit his stride, he had to adjust 
to a new high school coach — his 
father accepted a job at Saline 
High School after working as 
a part-time coach at Eastern 
Michigan.

“Had I been coaching at 

Eastern, 
I 
wouldn’t 
have 

experienced that with him,” 
Gary Bastien said. “That was just 
a great time to be able to coach 
your son.”

Added his son: “Sometimes 

it was frustrating, because he 
would tell me I wasn’t doing 
something right. I would butt 
heads with my dad sometimes, 
but 
overall 
it 
was 
a 
cool 

experience.”

With his father’s help, Steven 

was able to win Mr. Track and 
Field for the state of Michigan 
and set personal records in 
nearly every event.

* * *

With college looming, Steven 

decided he wanted to get away 
from his hometown for the first 
time. For the first two years of 
his collegiate career, he attended 
Samford University in Alabama. 
Under coach Rod Tiffin, he 
improved his long jump, but his 
body quickly wore out.

“In that conference, I was 

doing so much,” Steven said. 
“My last outdoor season there, 
I went into the meet banged up 
from the rest of the season, but I 
did 14 events in two days. It was 
probably too much for my body to 
do all that.”

Unlike when he was younger, 

Steven wasn’t able to handle the 
sheer quantity of events. The 
fun he previously experienced 

couldn’t surpass the exhaustion. 
He 
decided 
he 
wanted 
to 

specialize more and focus on 
what he did best.

And in the back of his mind, 

Michigan 
had 
always 
been 

calling. Having grown up just 
outside Ann Arbor, that was 
where he wanted to be.

When 
former 
Wolverines 

runner Garrick Roemer called 
Steven to convince him to 
transfer, he was brought back 
to the days of playing in the 
backyard in Saline, where he and 
Roemer were childhood friends. 
Once Steven mentioned it to his 
father and they looked into it, a 
transfer made sense because of 
Michigan coach Jerry Clayton’s 
pedigree.

Steven envisioned the days of 

backyard basketball and Saline 
track and the fun days that lay 
ahead, but when Steven finally 
arrived on campus, his friend 
was no longer here. As Steven 
was taking his finals at the end 
of last year, Roemer passed away. 
Still, Clayton convinced him to 
stay.

“He is one of the best coaches 

in the world,” Gary said. “I know 
that because I threw against him 
when I coached at Eastern, but 

what Steven and I didn’t know 
is that he is not just a throwing 
coach. 
Steven 
will 
call 
me 

constantly and say, ‘You know 
what Coach Clayton told me 
about the high jump?’ and I will 
hang up the phone and I start 
walking through what he said, 
going, ‘You know, that makes 
sense, I didn’t know that.’ ”

And as helpful as Clayton’s 

wisdom has been on Steven’s 
running, he has been able to use 
it to cope with Roemer’s death as 
well.

“In order to be a decathlete, 

it’s just a different personality 
in order to be successful, and he 
seems to have that,” Clayton said. 
“You have to have that ability 
that when you do one event, and 
if things don’t go well you have to 
forget it and go to the next event, 
and he has that capacity.”

* * *

Since coming to Michigan, 

even despite the tremendous grief 
of dealing with a friend’s death, 
Bastien has competed like he did 
when he was a kid — carefree. 
Clayton has allowed him to focus 
on being a decathlete through 
more individual treatment and 
day-to-day instruction.

After a disappointing run at the 

Big Ten Indoor Championships 
this winter, Bastien came into 
the NCAA Championships with 
a different mindset. Before the 
race, he was nervous, but this 
time he decided to go in with the 
mentality to have fun, put it all on 
the line and take a few risks.

It paid off, as Bastien set the 

program record for most points 
in a heptathlon twice and became 
Michigan’s first All-American in 
the event.

With 
Bastien 
comfortably 

under Clayton’s wing, the father 
who never wanted to push his son 
can finally take a step back. Gary 
Bastien watched his son become 
an All-American the same way he 
saw him dunk that basketball all 
those years ago — from afar.

Wolverines fall to MSU in Detroit

By ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS

Daily Sports Writer

DETROIT — The Michigan 

baseball team was unable to 
continue its streak of success on 
Tuesday night, falling to Michi-
gan State, 4-2, in a close contest at 
Comerica Park.

The Wol-

verines (6-6 
Big 
Ten, 

21-15 over-
all) had won nine of their previ-
ous 11 games entering Tuesday, 
which presented Michigan with 
an opportunity to continue its 
rise in the Big Ten standings and 
to keep the season’s momentum 
alive.

On the mound for the Wol-

verines was junior left-hander 
Evan Hill, who had pitched just 
5.1 innings all season. He was 
looking to use Tuesday night’s 
game as another step on the road 
back to reclaiming his role in the 
weekend rotation, where he was 

regularly featured last season.

But Hill was rusty. Through his 

five innings of work, Hill allowed 
seven hits and three earned runs 
while striking out two.

“You can’t make mistakes to 

good hitters,” Hill said. “When 
you do, they make you pay. But, 
in general, I think my stuff is 
close to being where it was last 
year.”

Michigan coach Erik Bakich, 

though, did not think Hill’s per-
formance was the reason for his 
team’s defeat. Instead, he praised 
the junior pitcher for his off-the-
field contributions.

“I thought he pitched well 

enough for us to win,” Bakich 
said. “And it’s great to have him 
back, not only because he’s a great 
pitcher, but because of his leader-
ship, experience and physical tal-
ent. It’s a big lift for our team.”

In the fourth inning, Michigan 

State (4-5, 19-15) broke open the 
scoring, as shortstop Ryan Rich-
ardson hit a two-out RBI single.

But in just the next frame, the 

Wolverines 
responded. 
After 

senior catcher Kendall Patrick 
was hit by a pitch and junior sec-
ond baseman Jacob Cronenworth 
singled to right, the Wolverines 
were set up to do damage. Senior 
centerfielder 
Jackson 
Glines 

bunted both runners over, which 
brought up junior third baseman 
Travis Maezes.

Maezes, who is still not fully 

healthy — a strained oblique 
kept him out until April 1 — did 
not disappoint. He knocked a 
two-run single to right field, and 
Michigan led, 2-1.

The rally came to an abrupt 

end, though, when Maezes was 
thrown out at home trying to tag 
up on a flyout by junior left fielder 
Cody Bruder for the second out of 
the inning. The Wolverines did 
not score for the rest of the game.

That ended up being a crucial 

turning point in a game where 
scoring opportunities were hard 
to come by. Michigan State did 
not let Michigan forget it.

“I was taking a chance, I want-

ed to be aggressive,” Maezes said. 
“I tagged up; it didn’t work out. 
They made a good catch, a good 
throw, a good tag. I was looking 
to take advantage of an opportu-
nity. If he catches it, a two-out hit 
is a lot to ask.”

Added Bakich: “We had a guy 

with speed at third — you try to 
press the situation a little bit. The 
catcher made a nice pick on the 

short hop, and he made a nice tag. 
If that situation comes up again, 
we’re going to do the same thing, 
because that’s an opportunity to 
score.”

In the bottom of the fifth, the 

Spartans recaptured the lead. 
After getting a strike out with 
runners on second and third, Hill 
was one out away from escaping 
the jam. But first baseman Ryan 
Krill lined a double to right field 
that cleared the bases, and Michi-
gan State was up, 3-2.

In the seventh inning, Maezes 

came up to the plate with runners 
on first and third and only one 
out, and the Wolverines looked 
poised to strike back. But Maezes 
grounded into an inning-ending 
double play.

“We stranded too many run-

ners on base tonight,” Bakich 
said. “But sometimes it’s just luck. 
You can hit the hardest ball of 
your life and somebody catches it, 
or you can get jammed and it falls 
in for a hit.”

Freshman right-hander Bryan 

Pall came in to pitch in the eighth 
inning. He surrendered a leadoff 
ground-rule double to third base-
man Mark Weist, who advanced 
to third on a sacrifice fly. Weist 
scored on a wild pitch, giving 
Michigan State a 4-2 lead.

In the ninth inning, the Wol-

verines went down in order.

After stranding nine runners 

on base, it was a game of missed 
opportunities for Michigan.

Comerica a field 
of dreams for ‘M’

By DANNY VARGOVICK

Daily Sports Writer

DETROIT — For a day, it was 

a field of dreams.

The MLB Opening Day logo 

on the grass was slightly faded, 
and the ivy on the fountain 
beyond the centerfield fence 
was still brown from the 
winter, but Comerica Park was 
a fantastic setting for a weekday 
game between in-state rivals 
Michigan 
and Michigan 
State.

Both 

teams 
have 

a 
number 

of 
players 

who 
hail 

from Detroit 
suburbs and 
grew 
up 

rooting 
for 

the Tigers. It 
was an opportunity for these 
players to play on the same 
field Miguel Cabrera and David 
Price took for Opening Day 
eight days earlier. It was a night 
to remember for these college 
players who, statistically, are 
unlikely to ever take the field 
for an MLB Opening Day 
themselves.

The game was scheduled at 

a neutral site because, for the 
second straight year, the two 
teams weren’t scheduled to 
play each other in conference 
play. Both head coaches said 
that it was a priority to play 
their in-state rivals in the 
non-conference 
season, 
but 

they struggled to agree on a 
location. 

Comerica Park made sense 

as a compromise for the single-
game showdown.

For 
the 
underclassman 

Wolverines, it was their first 
college game at a major league 
park and first college game 
against the Spartans.

Some of the older players 

on the team have had a little 
more 
experience 
in 
major 

league parks. Two years ago, 

the team played Northwestern 
at Wrigley Field, home of the 
Chicago Cubs; Seton Hall at Citi 
Field, home of the New York 
Mets; and multiple teams in the 
Big Ten Tournament at Target 
Field, home of the Minnesota 
Twins.

Comerica is one of the bigger 

venues in the major leagues, 
and it is substantially larger 
than the Wilpon Complex in 
Ann Arbor, providing different 

dimensions for 
hitters to deal 
with.

The fence at 

Wilpon is 312 
feet down the 
left field line, 
320 feet down 
the right field 
line and 395 
feet to center. 
Comerica 
is 

345 feet to left, 

330 feet to right and 420 feet to 
center.

Centerfield at Comerica is 

notorious for swallowing all 
but the longest Miguel Cabrera 
bombs to center and right-
center.

“That’s the goal — to hit 

line drives,” said junior third 
baseman Travis Maezes. “We 
as a team today hit too many fly 
balls. Growing up here, you see 
that it’s not an offensive park, so 
those are routine fly balls that 
everyone can catch.”

Junior left-hander Evan Hill 

also said that he tried to pitch 
to contact with the spacious 
outfield behind him.

The seats weren’t filled like 

they were for Opening Day 
last week, but the game still 
drew a substantial number of 
fans from both sides. It offered 
fans from the Detroit area an 
easier opportunity to reach the 
game than if it had been in East 
Lansing or Ann Arbor.

“It’s a dream for all of these 

guys to play at this level on a 
daily basis, and you get a taste 
of it,” said Michigan State coach 
Jake Boss.

BASEBALL

“It’s a dream for 
all these guys to 
play at this level 
on a daily basis.”

COVER BY MEGAN MULHOLLAND

Students of the Year

A president, some Nobel Prize winners, a few Internet moguls, 

and Darth Vader — there is a high precedent set for students who 
graduate from the University. To say that the University can be over-
whelming is an understatement. With 41,927 students, 1,397 student 
organizations registered on Maize Pages, and over 100 possible 
majors, it’s often easy to get lost in the shuffle.

But somehow students find their way and then some, going from 

scared, M-planner-toting freshman to leaders, innovators, and 
activists in a few short years. While the many accomplishments of 
the University’s current students could fill volumes, each year the 
Statement narrows down the impressive pool to a few select student 
leaders. Some chosen for the intense commitment they show to one 
activity, others for the impact they have over campus as a whole. 
Some come to the University with ambitious plans in mind, while 
others have found their way and grown once arriving in Ann Arbor. 
Between these ten students, you will find ten different majors, doz-
ens of student organizations, and hundreds of peers impacted and 
influenced.

Meet the Michigan Daily Students of the Year 2014-2015. They’re 

all happy to meet you.

worked with the Better Living Using 
Engineering 
Laboratory, 
a 
student 

organization guiding nine team proj-
ects using a human-centered sustain-
able design process to collaborate with 
communities both local and around the 
world to work on an identified need. 
Some of the groups’ previous projects 
include providing nighttime lighting, 
organizing education engineering work-

shops and irrigating fields and farm-
lands.

Six of the teams are based abroad in 

communities in Nicaragua, Guatemala, 
Jamaica, Mexico, India, and El Salvador. 
The teams travel to their partner com-
munities over class breaks throughout 
the year to help implement their proj-
ects.

As BLUElab president this past year, 

Patel is one of a few team members not 
studying engineering — she’s earning 
dual degrees in International Studies 
and Biology with a minor in Business. 
Though she was originally a little intim-
idated, she said collaborating with stu-
dents from different fields of study has 
been an important experience.

“Working with the engineers and 

L

SA senior Natasha Dabrowski’s face 
turned red from “talking about herself” 
and her nomination for Student of the 

Year.

“I’m truly humbled by this,” she said. “I do feel 

like I’ve been a really hard worker on campus, but 
I know that there are a lot of people that put in a 
lot of time and energy and effort into making this 
campus a better place.”

Dabrowski is LSA Student Government presi-

dent and an active member of the Michigan Club 
Tennis team and Delta Gamma sorority. But she 
was more than willing to take time out of her busy 
schedule to discuss her nomination.

Throughout the conversation, Dabrowski speaks 

expressively, but cautiously about her achievements 
on campus — modest about her role in impacting 
her larger campus community and never failing to 
give credit to those who have helped her in achiev-
ing her goals.

Dabrowski served as a student representative 

on the Race and Ethnicity Subcommittee respon-
sible for updating the requirement for the coming 
school year. She was also responsible for creating 
a religion minor through the University’s History 
department, which she was the first student to 
complete.

“I did this not without the help of many other 

students on LSA student government and adminis-
trators,” Dabrowski said. “I came to campus recog-
nizing a lack of an overarching major or minor or 
program where students could learn about a lot of 
different things rather than study one specific eth-
nic studies or religious studies course.”

Diversity is important to Dabrowski. Her family, 

she said, hosted a foreign exchange student almost 
every year while she was in high school, and, while 
she valued the international exposure, she still 
found it limiting.

“Here on campus I’ve been able to work with

t’s suggested that those who grow 
up in the Midwest are forever sub-
scribed to the region’s wholesome 

values — an admirable work ethic con-
trasted by modesty, along with the desire 
to help others. If there’s a student who 
embodies the favorable, friendly and 
hard-working Midwestern archetype, its 
Ford school junior Hannah Lee.

Between her extroverted nature and 

her glass-half-full mentality, it’s clear 
why Lee is regarded as a positive influ-
ence within both the classroom and 
her extensive extracurriculars. She’s a 
socializer through and through — outgo-
ing and outspoken, radiating optimism 
when she speaks of her causes of concern, 

mainly social justice and equality. With 
accolades including her 2014 Freshman 
of The Year award, it’s clear she’s been 
and continues to be on track to pursue 
her goals as a catalyst of social change.

Along with pursuing a degree in public 

policy focused on inequalities in health 
and the environment coupled with a 
minor in community action and social 
change, Lee is also employed at the Life 
Sciences Institute, is a recently elected 
member of Central Student Government, 
is involved in Common Ground through 
the program on Intergroup Relations, 
and is captain of the women’s club soccer 
team.

learning from us is an integral 
experience because that’s what 
it will be like in the real world, 
you’re not just like surrounded 
by people who are just like you 
in terms of your academic back-
ground,” 
Patel 
said. 
“Having 

people that are not engineers do 
provide a lot of benefits. I think 
people value that too.”

Though 
as 
president 
Patel 

works with all the BLUElab teams, 
she first began her involvement as 
a member and then project leader 
of BLUElab Sa Nimá Collabora-
tive, a project working to bring 
nighttime lighting to Samox San 
Luca, Guatemala. The town cur-
rently uses candles for lighting 

because of limited energy sources. 
Patel has traveled to the project’s 
partner community in Guatemala 
three times.

“That team has definitely been 

the most meaningful to me in 
college, even sometimes more so 
than being President of BLUElab 
because Sa Nimá is the way that I 
got into all this work,” Patel said.

Throughout college Patel was 

also involved with the Ginsburg 
Student Advisory Board and was 
a member of the University figure 
skating team. However, working 
with BLUElab has become her 
primary endeavor.

“I’ve dropped everything else 

that I do just to focus my heart 

into this and be able to provide 
as many hours a week into this as 
possible,” Patel said. “I sometimes 
wish I could have done everything 
I used to be doing, but it’s been 
so worth it to me to put in all this 
effort into BLUElab and see where 
it’s gone this past year and helping 
all our teams as much as I can.”

Engineering junior Katherine 

Rouen, BLUElab internal vice 
president, said Patel has been 
one of the BLUElab’s most trans-
formative presidents and has 
moved the organization forward 
throughout her presidency.

“She’s really been someone who 

has moved BLUElab away from 
solely 
implementing 
technol-

ogy, and being more about think-
ing about the end users and the 
stakeholders that we work with,” 
Rouen said.

Rouen said Patel worked to 

meet with each team and reached 
out to individual team members.

“When she’s involved in some-

thing she’s 100 percent there,” 
said LSA junior Emilee Lewis, a 
member of Sa Nimá Collaborative. 
“I feel like that’s the main thing 
that’s hard to find nowadays. 
When you have a meeting with 
Keya, she is 100 percent present 
and you’re the only thing that 
matters at that moment.”

Patel 
said 
working 
with 

BLUElab has been the most valu-

able experience throughout her 
time at the University. She said the 
skills she has harnessed through 
her leadership within the orga-
nization are very translatable to 
the professional workforce. After 
graduation, Patel will be working 
with sales and business strategy 
for Dropbox.

“Sometimes to me the work I 

do with BLUElab is so much more 
valuable than school stuff,” Patel 
said. “I’ve learned so much more 
out of BLUElab than I ever think 
I would have in class and I spend 
more hours a week doing BLUE 
lab than studying for my classes. 
You learn so much out of it, so it’s 
totally worth it to me in the end.”

international students, with trans-
fer students, with students from 
all across the nation, students who 
have totally different political and 
religious beliefs than myself,” Dab-
rowski said. “The University in a 
lot of ways can create spaces for 
you to talk about those even for 
students who might not self-select 
to create those conversations. It’s 
easy to just go through college 
and just take classes and focus on 
your studies, but I’ve been so much 
more enriched by all of the organi-
zational and academic experiences 
pushing me to go beyond the class-
room.”

Dabrowski endured a long pro-

cess of creating proposals and 
doing research at both the Univer-

sity and peer institutions to judge 
the feasibility of creating the new 
program. Her work culminated 
in speaking in front of the His-
tory department, from whom she 
received the support to continue 
shaping the logistics of the new 
minor.

“It’s still, to date — my LSA stu-

dent government adviser jokes 
— the fastest student government 
project we’ve had ever,” Dabrowski 
added.

But Dabrowski is a determined 

person and navigating the bureau-
cracy of the University is some-
thing that comes naturally to her, 
according to LSA senior Corey 
Walsh, LSA SG vice presiden.

“It’s definitely something that 

does not come easily to many 
people, but with Natasha, it’s like 
a dance,” Walsh said. “She always 
knows who exactly to be speaking 
to, always has the perfect agenda 
and always has a next step, where-
as a lot of people face roadblocks 
and give up because they think it’s 
an unattainable task, but with her 
it’s always ‘here’s our next venue, 
this is where we’re going next, I’ll 
see you at the next meeting.’”

It’s Dabrowski’s friendly and 

energetic personality, Walsh said, 
that really motivates their projects 
and their agendas as student gov-
ernment executives.

“Something that’s most strik-

ing to me about (Dabrowski) is the 
emotional contagion that she has,” 

Walsh said. “She exudes this ener-
gy and light that’s so contagious 
for all of the other people that she 
spends time with. Being around 
her you always feel engaged and 
you always want to care about what 
she cares about because of the emo-
tion that she exudes.”

But out of all of her experiences 

on campus, Dabrowski said she 
will miss the people who have sup-
ported and guided her here most of 
all when she graduates in May.

“In my senior year I’ve been 

able to make even more friends 
and meet even more people,” she 
said. “I think that has created such 
an unforgettable friendship that I 
know those relationships will go 
beyond the campus, but they thrive 

so much here. A couple of months 
from now, I won’t be able to go 
down the street and be able to see 
five of my friends. I’ll have to fly 
across the country perhaps. The 
relationships that you create and 
form from all of these transforma-
tive experiences are ones that I will 
miss the most. I’ll continue them, 
but they’re just going to be differ-
ent.”

Continuing 
her 
government 

and policy-making involvement, 
Dabrowski said she is eyeing a few 
public policy and PR positions in 
Washington, D.C. after graduating.

“I’m still navigating my future,” 

Dabrowski said. “As of right now, 
the nature of politics is that doors 
open very quickly.”

tions, there’s a theme of inclusion 
and diversity and social justice,” 
she said. “That is something I’m 
super passionate about, creating 
spaces for all students on campus 
to feel comfortable. “

Within her sizable sphere of 

campus involvement, comprised 
of contributions she modestly 
regards as “small,” she makes a 
point to help others realize their 
full potential. Even over coffee 
for an interview focused on her 
accomplishments, Lee was more 
interested in the minute details of 
my life than discussing herself.

When she arrived on campus 

by way of her relatively homog-
enous hometown of Rochester, Lee 
sought out opportunities to engage 
in and provide diversity education. 
She immediately became involved 
in the Michigan Community Schol-
ars program because of its social 
justice and community service 
focus. In attempts to foster inclu-
sive environments, Lee facilitates 
weekly 
three-hour 
discussions 

on religion within her Intergroup 
Relations class. Among her group 
of 18 students varying in race, 
gender, religion and sexual ori-
entation, she successfully enables 
forward-thinking conversations of 

coexistence and open-minded per-
spectives. Within the group, she 
makes a point to not only create an 
inclusive and comfortable space for 
all, but also speak from a humanis-
tic standpoint. 

“I know diversity takes time and 

its sometimes hard to understand 
where other people are coming 
from, but if you have more perspec-
tives and if you are understanding 
more people, it really helps you 
become a better person,” she said. 
“There was a moment where I feel 
like my group clicked, it was really 
cool because I know through dia-
logue, it’s changing people’s per-

spectives and how they see the 
world.”

She sources her inspiration 

from her seemingly well-rounded 
upbringing, insisting her parents 
initiated her fascination with dif-
ferent cultures and customs, and 
that she was raised to care and 
fight for others, understand them 
and enact change together.

“My parents gave me experi-

ences to show me that that’s not the 
norm in the world,” she said. “They 
took me on a lot of humanitarian 
and mission trips, we did a lot of 
service in Pontiac and Detroit.”

Looking towards the future of 

her positive pathway, Lee hopes to 
continue utilizing her resources to 
promote causes for social justice, 
ideally in philanthropy, social jus-
tice and dialogue. Last summer she 
found her niche within her work 
for a nonprofit.

“I see philanthropy as your 

time, your treasure, and your tal-
ent. I think my long terms are to 
engage in philanthropy somehow, 
whether that’s working for a non-
profit or for a foundation,” she said. 
“I would love to be a professor one 
day, I think that would be such an 
amazing job, teaching and being 
part of academia.”

FACES of the CROWD


“

Forever Go Blue.” Those three words 
are often used to communicate what 
cannot truly be defined by words: fierce 

love for the University and its community, 
the love that wide-eyed Wolverine-under-
lings only glimpse at orientation and even-
tually build through every late night cram 
session, every unexpected friendship and 
every game day throughout their time here. 
Until once the tassel switches sides, we can’t 
think to say anything else. Some students 
take that slogan to heart, caring about the 
University so much that they continue on 
here after receiving their degrees — students 
like David Moore.

In 2014, Moore received a BSE in mechan-

ical engineering in the top 3 percent of his 

class. He also swam for the NCAA champi-
onship-winning men’s varsity swim team, 
serving as captain during his senior year. 
After graduating, Moore returned to the 
University last fall to complete a Masters in 
Mechanical Engineering. Now that he’s no 
longer on the swim team, he has used his free 
time to soak up every bit of Ann Arbor and 
Michigan before he flies across the pond to 
study at the University of Oxford on a pres-
tigious Rhodes scholarship. He is one of the 
32 Rhodes scholars selected from 877 nomi-
nees in 2015 and the only one representing 
the University. He plans to use his first year 
of studies to get a Masters in Environmental 
Change and Management and an MBA in his 
second.

Sound daunting? Maybe, maybe not. 

Moore approaches learning from a broad 
perspective.

“I don’t want to limit myself to just work-

ing on one small aspect of this larger prob-
lem of affecting people around the world,” he 
said. “I want to think about the whole chain 
of events that needs to happen in order to 
achieve that.”

His end-goal is to design innovative, 

sustainable technology that can help solve 
some of the world’s biggest problems. Dur-
ing his undergraduate years, he was heavily 
involved with the Tauber Institute and Engi-
neering Global Leadership honors program. 
Through these experiences, he was able to 
supplement his skills designing and develop-
ing products with manufacturing and opera-
tions acumen. He believes his future plans 

of study will “complete that perspective of 
design, operations, and business as a whole.”

But amid all of his academic and profes-

sional successes, Moore said a competitive 
drive will stay close to his heart.

“I’d say that I’m an athlete in all aspects 

of my life,” he said. “I compete, and I learn, 
I dedicate, and I set goals, and I would not 
have been able to achieve nearly as much as 
I have if I was not in athletics, especially at 
Michigan.”

Perhaps the most obvious effect of athlet-

ics lies in Moore’s unending dedication to 
community and teamwork. When speaking 
about anything — dealing with the pressure 
to maintain the swim team’s tradition of 
excellence while he was captain, the motiva-

tions behind his career goals — everything 
starts and ends with other people.

“I came to Michigan extremely motivated 

and ready to do really well individually,” he 
said. “I wanted to get all As, I wanted to join 
the swim team and do well with them, but 
the biggest place that I’ve grown is realizing 
that it’s not about me, it’s about the people 
that I affect along the way. My goal-setting 
has changed from … ‘What I want to do?’ to 
‘How can I help other people become the 
best person they can be?’ ”

His term as captain was a way of giving 

back. His work as a graduate student instruc-
tor helping students learn design and manu-
facturing in Mechanical Engineering 250, 
his favorite undergraduate course, is a way 
of giving back. When I asked him if he had 
anything he’d like to end on, this is the advice 
he’s giving back to all of us still bumbling our 
way through undergrad:

“Enjoy every minute you have here. 

There’s no way I could ever give back nearly 
as much as what Michigan’s gave me. Every 
day I walk by the flag on top of the Union, 
and it just makes me smile and I know this 
place will always be my home.”

During campus tours for prospective stu-

dents, tour guides take groups to the Union 
steps, where they point out carvings above 
the doors that represent the pillars of an 
ideal Wolverine: scholarship and athlet-
ics. For someone who loves the University 
as much as Moore does, it’s only fit that he 
embodies those traits so well.

T

hough the season had been over for 
almost a week, LSA senior Nicole 
Elmblad was still on duty as captain 

of the women’s basketball team on April 7. 
With two teammates feeling sick, she picked 
up popsicles to help ease their pain.

The two-time Academic All-American, 

three-time Academic All-Big Ten, and two-
year captain — voted in unanimously by her 
teammates both years — has excelled on 
the basketball court. After all, she does hold 
the records for most games played (133) and 
wins (82). But her efforts on campus have 
been noticed as well.

Majoring in Biopsychology, Cognition, 

and Neuroscience, Elmblad has over a 3.9 
GPA and hopes to attend medical school. 
She will take a gap year following gradu-
ation with plans to participate in hospital 
research and take the MCAT.

Elmblad grew up in St. Ignace, located at 

the southernmost tip of the Upper Peninsu-
la, in a “Michigan family,” and her long love 
for the University is constantly demonstrat-
ed through her participation on campus.

She has been involved with the Student-

Athlete Advisory Committee since her 
sophomore year, along with volunteering for 
a variety of other organizations. She helped 
plan Maize Night Madness pep rally and 
volunteers at Mott Children’s Hospital and 
Food Gatherers.

“When she talks about the University of 

Michigan, she gets super emotional,” Michi-
gan coach Kim Barnes Arico said in Novem-
ber. “She loves this place and what our 
University stands for and what our program 
stands for. For her, it’s about being a part of 
something bigger than herself.”

This season, the Wolverines weren’t able 

to return to the NCAA Tournament and 
endured a few tough losses during their 
season, including falling to Minnesota in 
double overtime and getting kicked out of 
the Big Ten Tournament by Michigan State 
in the second round.

Elmblad was able to keep her team’s spir-

its high throughout it all.

“It’s never easy to go through a stretch 

where you’re losing games, especially at the 

end of the season when we had put ourselves 
into a really good position to potentially 
make a run in the Big Ten Tournament and 
get a berth into the NCAA (Tournament),” 
Elmblad said.

“And to see a tough stretch in Febru-

ary, it’s hard to keep your team motivated, 
but I think you’re able to do that if you set 
a tone right from the beginning of the sea-
son that no matter what the circumstances 
are, you’re going to work hard and come into 
practice every day with a great attitude.”

Elmblad 
exemplified 
that 
attitude 

throughout the WNIT, and her numbers 
speak for themselves. After averaging 7.4 
points and 6.8 rebounds in the regular 
season, she averaged 10.4 points and 8.2 
rebounds in the postseason to help lead her 
team to the semifinals of the tournament. 
Her performance didn’t go unnoticed and 
she was named to the WNIT all-tourna-
ment team.

“(Being named to the WNIT all-tour-

nament team) was definitely really cool,” 
Elmblad said. “I’m very thankful for the 
way that my career ended. Even though we 
didn’t necessarily win the championship, I 
couldn’t have thought of a better way to end 
it out on Crisler in front of friends and fam-
ily.

“I was having fun that whole tournament. 

Looking back on it, I thought I was playing 
my best basketball at the end of the season.”

Even near the end of her career, Elmblad 

was always finding a way to improve her 
game. But those individual achievements 
are often shrouded by her outstanding char-
acter, and she wouldn’t have it any other 
way.

“She’s the most unselfish kid in the pro-

gram, and I think her teammates truly value 
that,” Barnes Arico said in November. “They 
value how hard she works every day. They 
value her commitment to the success of our 
program, but also her commitment to Mich-
igan.”

And that’s why, even a week after her 

duties as captain were up, she didn’t mind 
spending some extra time on her team-
mates.

W

ith a quiet voice and kind 
smile, LSA junior Olivia Rath’s 
greatest accomplishments are 

unknown to her, but her dedication to the 
University community shines through in 
everything she does.

“I saw something on Pinterest the other 

day,” Rath said in an interview. “It’s prob-
ably stupid but it really resonated with me. 
It said you don’t climb a mountain for the 
world to see you, you climb a mountain so 
you can see the world.”

Raised in Farmington Hills, Mich., Rath 

is an Organization Studies and Program 
in the Environment double major with a 
minor in Spanish.

Among Rath’s involvement includes 

Dance Marathon, where she is the rising 
planning director, Graham Sustainabil-
ity Scholars, and an Organization Studies 
Club. She works in two research labs and 
coordinated a Culture Shift event.

Her highest priority on campus is Dance 

Marathon, which Rath has participated in 
for three years. She said the aspect that 
appealed to her the most was the campus 
unity she felt.

“I fell in love with it after my first year,” 

Rath said. “It really unites the three parts 
of campus — the academic campus, the 
hospital, and the athletics, because we get 
our venue from them.”

One of Rath’s other major accomplish-

ments from this year is serving as a Cul-
ture Shift Coordinator. Culture Shift is an 
event created to be a platform for student 
leaders to engage with each other on cam-
pus. This year, the issue the event high-
lighted was sexual assault prevention.

“It provides students with a common 

academic ground on an issue and a space 
for students to have a productive space to 
have a dialogue about those issues,” Rath 
explained. “We also work to include stu-
dents who wouldn’t otherwise be given 
a seat at the table for these kinds of dia-
logues.”

Rath said, as someone who primarily 

works behind the scenes for many of her 
organizations, a Student of the Year award 
has served as validation that her hard 

work is paying off.

“It definitely shows that I’ve accom-

plished something,” Rath said. “I don’t feel 
like what I’ve done is a lot because I see it 
as a part of the campus experience.”

LSA senior Marissa Alaniz, who worked 

as Rath’s director in DMUM, said Rath 
was an essential part of the DMUM lead-
ership team.

Alaniz said Rath’s professionalism and 

grace helped her easily find the balance 
between delegating tasks and serving as a 
leader. She added that Rath’s kindness and 
patience made their work relationship a 
supportive and friendly one as well.

“The behind-the-scenes nature of her 

work often leads it to go unnoticed, but 
Olivia has helped DMUM greatly in the 
short-term and long-term,” Alaniz said. 
“Her committee succeeded in working 
with local businesses to acquire item dona-
tions for our silent auction at our Gala and 
food donations for our Dance Marathon, 
and she has laid the groundwork for her 
position in the long-term in continuing to 
elevate our partners’ support for DMUM.”

Alaniz added she is confident that Rath’s 

passion and drive will benefit her greatly 
in future endeavors.

Rath added that her experience at the 

University has shaped the level of involve-
ment with campus organizations she has 
taken part in.

“I’m the kind of person who goes to all 

of the free lectures I can,” Rath said. “All of 
the opportunities I’ve been blessed with — 
I can’t imagine not using those opportuni-
ties, because it comes with the university 
experience.”

Looking forward, Rath said she hopes to 

work in sustainability development and is 
open to any workplace where an organiza-
tion would intersect with the natural envi-
ronment.

“I don’t ever want to leave this place,” 

Rath said. “I hope I’ll be able to find com-
munities that are as productive and help-
ful as the ones I’ve found here.”

LSA junior Sammie Lyons recalls a 

quote by E.B. White for daily inspiration: 
“I get up every morning determined to 
both change the world and have one hell of 
a good time. Sometimes this makes plan-
ning my day difficult.”

Lyons’ pursuit to make the people 

around her happier and better off are 
exemplified through her involvement 
on campus. Along with being a diversity 
peer educator at Mary Markley Hall, she 
is the development chair of Dance Mara-
thon, actively involved in MRun, and the 
president of Campus Cursive — a student 
organization that sends love letters to 
individuals in effort to empower and uplift 
them. She also works as the undergraduate 
chair for the student campaign committee 
in the Office of University Development.

For Lyons, she understood that her 

limited time at the University would be 
shaped not in a classroom, but through the 
work she did with her peers and commu-
nity.

“Most of the learning you’re going to 

get from this education is going to be 
your work on campus,” Lyons said. “It’s 
not going to be you looking at a computer 
screen writing a paper, or reading a text-
book. It’s going to be about the events you 
put on for your organization, it’s going to 
be learning how to communicate with 
other people and understand how to empa-
thize with other people.”

Specifically, Lyons finds her motivation 

through community service and philan-
thropic work.

For most of her time on campus, her 

primary involvement has been working 
with Dance Marathon. DMUM is a large 
student-run organization on campus that 
helps raise money and awareness for pedi-
atric rehabilitation therapy at local hospi-
tals. Furthermore, Lyons has been part of 
Alpha Phi Omega, the professional frater-
nity devoted to community service, par-
ticipated in an alternative spring break at 
an HIV/AIDS resource center in New York 
and helped found Campus Cursive.

Lyons says her involvement in the com-

munity and serving others is what gives 
her motivation in life. She describes her-
self as someone “made for others.”

“Who we are as people is defined by the 

relationships that we’ve had,” Lyons said.

One of her motivations for helping 

the University community came after 
the death of her grandfather, who she 
described as a supporter of her work and 
a prominent person in her life. She said he, 
along with thirty-three other family mem-
bers, attended the University and made 
her feel at home here.

Currently, Lyons spends a lot of her 

time working as a diversity peer educator 
in Markley. In her position, she advises a 
multicultural council for freshmen and 
addresses instances of bias. She mentors 
over 1,000 freshmen and helps create a 
welcoming, respectful community for stu-
dents of all identities.

Though this follows her theme of striv-

ing to help communicate with others and 
empower them, she says it has also chal-
lenged her the most in her time on campus.

Specifically, Lyons noted an instance 

where she made a comment to a peer that 
she did not mean harm by, yet caused unin-
tentional pain to this peer. She said the 
instance help challenge her own precon-
ceived thoughts, and taught her how great 
the impact she can have on others is.

“It helped me see that the language I 

use is so powerful,” Lyons said.

When she isn’t working, Lyons says she 

enjoys rock climbing, playing the piano, 
and running.

After graduating, Lyons will continue to 

help make a difference in the community 
by joining the Peace Corps and then head-
ing to medical school. She said the best 
thing students on campus and in the com-
munity could do is to leave their comfort 
zones, and learn to love all other people 
without an agenda.

“Meet people to meet people, don’t meet 

them with an agenda,” Lyons said. “Be 
willing to change the blueprint that you 
might have set for yourself.”

A

fter finishing a mock job 
interview on the after-
noon of Nov. 24, History 

graduate student Austin McCoy 
received big news: it was the day 
the world would know if Darren 
Wilson would be indicted for kill-
ing Michael Brown. McCoy and 
his interviewer, Associate Prof. 
Matthew Countryman, along with 
other faculty and graduate stu-
dents, quickly pulled together a stu-
dent viewing of the announcement. 
Their hope was to give students 
both a place to watch and a way to 
understand the historical context 
of Ferguson’s upheaval — a topic 
McCoy had spoken about before.

“My first four years, I would con-

sider myself, you know, just a suc-
cessful grad student,” McCoy said, 
reflecting on his motivation to get 
involved as a student activist. “And 
then Trayvon Martin happened.”

The decision not to indict Wil-

son brought familiar deflation for 
McCoy, who felt himself profound-
ly changed when Martin’s killer, 
George Zimmerman, was found not 
guilty in 2013.

“Many of us are only one cop or 

one vigilante away from becoming 
a hashtag,” McCoy said. “It’s like, 
OK, I don’t have any choice right 
now but to get involved, because it’s 
that serious.”

Serious is certainly one way to 

describe McCoy’s work: a combina-

tion of grassroots organizing, racial 
justice education, and potentially 
groundbreaking research on Mid-
western cities in the seventies and 
eighties.

But if the urgency of these top-

ics has hardened McCoy at all, you 
wouldn’t get that from talking to 
him. Dressed in a purple sweater, 
shiny blue tie, and pristine white 
Nikes, McCoy often wears the kind 
of bright color that his consistent 
smile and loud laugh bring to a 
conversation. McCoy has the con-
fidence of a man six years into his 
Ph.D., and the unabashed optimism 
of an activist.

At 
the 
University, 
McCoy’s 

scholarship, organizing, and per-

W

hen asked, “tell me 
about how you got 
to Michigan,” most 

students respond with canned 
or rehearsed answers — “I grew 
up in this place,” “I wanted to do 
this thing with my life,” “I always 
knew I wanted to be a wolverine.” 
SMTD senior Khris Sanchez isn’t 
most students.

He begins by explaining the 

story of his parents: both immi-
grants from Peru, his dad took 
buses, trains, and even walked the 
distance from Peru to Oakland, 
Calif. to first arrive in the United 
States — holding on to the bottom 
of a train for hundreds of miles as 
he crossed the U.S. border. San-

chez is quick to bring up his par-
ent’s experiences, and it’s evident 
that much of his own personal 
philosophy has been shaped by 
their sacrifices.

A vocal performance major 

at the University, Sanchez’ path 
wasn’t always so clear. While 
he has held a love of music since 
preschool, even attending a pres-
tigious program called the Young 
Musician’s Program in the Bay 
Area, Sanchez actually started 
college at the University of Cali-
fornia, Irvine as an electrical 
engineering major, before trans-
ferring to the University.

“I felt incomplete because I 

wasn’t studying music. Electrical 

engineering just made me sad. It 
wasn’t my passion,” Sanchez said. 
“The only reason I did it was to 
satisfy my dad because he thought 
I would have a more stable job. 
But he saw how I was more pas-
sionate for music and he said ‘I 
respect you son, you do that.’”

Halfway through his freshman 

year, Sanchez had the opportuni-
ty to perform in front of one of the 
renowned SMTD vocal profes-
sors. He was then offered a schol-
arship to the University’s vocal 
program on the spot.

Once arriving at the Univer-

sity, Sanchez did not waste time 
becoming involved. Along with 
his extensive work in SMTD, he 

“

To those whom much is given, 
much is required,” reads the 
back of LSA junior William 

Royster’s T-shirt. The same shirt is 
being passed out to 46 high school 
freshman and sophomores in the 
main room of the Trotter Mul-
ticultural Center. The interview 
pauses as Will runs inside to give 
closing remarks to the three-day 
residential program he designed 
for Kalamazoo students to under-
stand the opportunities available at 
the University of Michigan.

“It was an idea in my head a year 

ago. I can’t describe how many 
hours we put in on this, raised 

$20,000 and we gave these stu-
dents an opportunity,” Royster said 
of the program.

William Royster, this year’s 

presidential candidate for The 
Team and a committee chair with 
the Black Student Union, has many 
ideas. This program, the Michigan 
Institute for the Improvement of 
African American Representation 
program, was one of them.

The ability to turn idea into real-

ity is Royster’s method of success. 
His answer is quick and prepared 
when asked about this. He has 
earned lots of it. As an independent 
student — his mother died when 

he was sixteen, and soon after his 
father left — Royster’s journey 
has been a steady uphill climb to 
remarkable achievement. He has 
no intentions of slowing down.

“You determine what you want 

to do, you make progress towards 
that thing, whatever it may be, and 
you do it. You do it well,” he said. 
“Today, seeing a lot of these kids 
from the same hometown as me 
with $50 stipends at the M-Den 
and me being able to say ‘Get what-
ever you want’ — that’s success.”

Royster has spent a great deal 

of time considering what it is he 
wants, for himself and for others.

sonality 
have 
commanded 
the 

respect of both students and facul-
ty, engaging in wide-ranging work 
but rarely advertising it. McCoy has 
been a key voice in the United Coali-
tion for Racial Justice, which last 
year organized an all night speak 
out on issues of race, attended by 
almost 1,000 students. Along with 
#BBUM, the UCRJ has shifted both 
the conversation on campus and the 
attitude of the administration when 
it comes to race.

“The reason people have so 

much respect for his leadership in 
the community is he never extends 
beyond his role,” said Countryman, 
who also co-chairs McCoy’s dis-
sertation committee. “He’s trying 

to bring voices that are not his own 
into the process. The irony of it is 
he gets propelled further into lead-
ership because he’s so principled 
about not reaching beyond where 
he stands.”

This year, McCoy has been at 

the center of students organizing 
against racial profiling and police 
violence, the reverberations of his 
and others’ work being felt through-
out Ann Arbor.

On the night of the grand jury 

announcement, 
McCoy 
sat 
in 

silence with others watching Presi-
dent Barack Obama speak, a split 
screen showing tear gas pour into 
the streets of Ferguson. Earlier that 
fall, McCoy marched through those 

same streets, a helicopter overhead. 
The next night, he felt himself back 
in Ferguson, hearing the propellers 
of a helicopter as he faced a massive 
crowd on the Diag.

“I remember just looking up, and 

I couldn’t see anything but people,” 
McCoy said, recalling his speech at 
that night’s march. “I had done a lot 
of public speaking, I had never spo-
ken at a march or anything like this, 
with this many people.”

Blending his scholarship and 

activism, McCoy told the crowd 
that the decision felt like a provoca-
tion for action, that the failures of 
the justice system were not inde-
pendent of America’s other debts.

“I remember as soon as I was 

finished, I just started crying, I was 
just bawling,” McCoy said. A grin 
came on his face, and he laughed 
describing how he fell into the arms 
of a nearby protester. “I was done … 
emotionally I was just spent.”

But he wasn’t alone.
Hundreds of demonstrators shut 

down the streets of Ann Arbor, 
the march propelling the activist 
group Ann Arbor to Ferguson, MO. 
Naturally, McCoy has been involved 
there as well, raising awareness 
about local policing issues like the 
shooting of Ann Arbor resident 
Aura Rosser.

Somehow, McCoy has found 

time to work on his dissertation, 
which he hopes to complete by next 

winter. His studies focus on the 
economic decline of cities during 
the seventies and eighties and the 
response by progressive activists. 
Countryman believes the research 
will be “a major contribution to the 
history of the 20th century in the 
Midwest.”

And what comes next for Mccoy?
“Any predictions would be lim-

iting,” Countryman, his professor 
and interviewer, said.

McCoy said he plans to enter 

the job market sometime next year, 
with a tenure track position as his 
top priority. But, McCoy pivoted 
with a laugh, “I don’t know if I will 
ever not be able to be an organizer 
or an activist.”

As a child, he dreamt of being a doc-
tor, of helping people.

“My mother said to me ‘Get an 

education. Make sure you make the 
most of the opportunities you have 
and give back,’ ” Royster said.

His skills in math and science led 

him to pursue engineering once he 
arrived at the University. Royster 
tutored, served as a research assis-
tant, and was also a part of the var-
sity wrestling team. Still, he felt as 
though his passion lied elsewhere.

“I spent a lot of time trying 

to align my passion with my tal-
ent and work ethic. When you put 
those things in the same place you 

can start to do incredible things to 
help people, to make this campus 
better,” he said.

He switched to African Ameri-

can Studies and Entrepreneurship. 
With this shift came an even stron-
ger sense of obligation to give back 
and explore new ways of doing so. 
Royster turned to music and poetry 
in addition to activism.

“We all have our narrative, and 

every person’s narrative deserves to 
be heard, every person’s narrative 
can add substance to another per-
son. I have a lot of stories of hard-
ship but I also have a lot of great 
moments in life. If I have the skill to 

share them, then I have to, it’s not 
really a choice,” he said. “I feel like 
once we get to that point where we 
feel like were obligated to give back, 
that’s when you really hit that point 
of ownership of your skills, and you 
can serve.”

Central Student Government, 

Royster believes, is one important 
place where these narratives can be 
shared and collaboration can grow, 
but it’s certainly not the only place. 
Despite The Team’s narrow loss in 
the elections, Royster’s commit-
ment to building unity on campus 
and increasing the volume of every 
student’s voice has only grown.

“So many communities and so 

many people joined to help in the 
process; it was life changing,” he 
said.

Collaboration, as opposed to com-

petition, is something Royster would 
like to see increase on campus.

“We’re all diverse in some way, 

whether it’s diversity of ideas, eth-
nicity, ability, but we all got here for 
different reasons. When we start to 
share and understand our narra-
tives of diversity, we start to have 
that collaboration that we all strive 
for, that we want and the University 
wants,” he said.

Lot’s of people profess these 

kinds of hopes for progress; few 
actually do anything. Royster’s 
candidness in his words and com-
mitment to action is evident even in 
our time together. Royster is heart, 
mind and body in the event of the 
day and the 41 students inside.

The quote on the shirt was spo-

ken at Royster’s high school gradu-
ation. It captures an outlook on 
life and on work that seemed to be 
already deeply ingrained within 
him. That is, graciousness for those 
people and opportunities that 
remind us of our strength, and the 
privileged obligation we have to 
give back.

also belongs to the Lambda Theta 
Phi Latin fraternity, sings in the 
a capella group Kopitonez, is a 
member of the College Advising 
Corps through the Center for Edu-
cational Outreach, and owns his 
own photography business.

Sanchez recalls vividly the 

moment he first learned the power 
his music held for others: as a first 
grader performing in a talent com-
petition.

“I go on stage, and when I sang 

my first note all the way to the end 
it was quiet for about ten seconds, 
and I thought ‘Maybe I did a bad 
job.’ But then everyone stood up 
and they started clapping so loud.”

With a laugh he recounts 

another memorable part of the 
evening: two eighth grade girls 
approaching 
him 
and 
kissing 

each of his cheeks. But it’s evident 
that Sanchez is not in music for 
the recognition. As a vocal major 
who specializes in opera, Sanchez 
readily admits that his medium is 
not the most popular for someone 
our age.

He shows the same drive for 

his operatic future that he does in 
his other activities. His plan for 
the future clearly maps out the 
next decade and a half of his life: 
hopefully vocal grad school at the 
University, studying and perform-
ing opera in Italy, then the same 
in Germany, before returning to 

his homeland of Peru to open a 
music conservatory for children. 
This part of the plan was inspired 
by seeing his mom’s own acts of 
goodwill in a small Peruvian vil-
lage, bringing suitcases full of 
clothing for the children there.

“My mom was so giving, so 

heartfelt, and I wanted to do that. 
Instead of doing that through 
clothes, I wanted to do it through 
music,” Sanchez said.

Sanchez’ 
many 
interests 

coalesced in the most recent 
project he spearheaded, a music 
show called Phenom that took 
place March 14 in the Mendels-
sohn Theater. Sanchez has always 
found vitality in furthering diver-

sity on campus, and this event 
did that through music, bringing 
together fifteen multicultural per-
formance groups on campus to 
promote cultural consciousness 
as well as raise awareness for the 
Lymphoma and Leukemia Society.

Sanchez lost his father to lym-

phoma this past December, and 
the support he and his family 
received after this event prompted 
him to find his own way to give 
back. Through chance, he came 
into contact with a family here in 
an Ann Arbor with a child suffer-
ing from leukemia, and the pro-
ceeds from the event were donated 
to offset their medical bills.

While it’s obvious that Sanchez 

has a wide array of talents and 
causes, one of the most impressive 
things about him is his constant 
optimism. He admits to singing on 
University busses and in exchange 
for burritos at Panchero’s, literally 
booming with warmth and pas-
sion. This all ties back to his par-
ents’ sacrifices so he could have a 
better life.

“Family. You can have a lot of 

friends, but they come and go. 
But family will be with you even 
in your hardest moments. And 
friends who were with me during 
those times, they are considered 
family… Without love and support 
from family, I don’t know how you 
can go far in life.”
