Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan 

announced 
Monday 
that 

the Detroit College Promise 
scholarship program, a part 
of the Detroit Public Schools 
Foundation, will be expanded 
provide full free tuition in 
four-year college programs to 
students who graduate from 
Detroit Public Schools.

The program has provided 

last-dollar 
scholarship 

funding — monies that aim 
to fill the financial gap left 
by 
scholarships 
to 
cover 

additional expenses— to more 
than 700 students. Previously, 
the program covered expenses 

that were not otherwise met by 
federal aid, including tuition 
fees, 
but 
the 
scholarships 

were not full coverage awards, 
which 
would 
satisfy 
all 

student expenses.

The new expansion has been 

introduced as a pilot plan to be 
tested with students from the 
2016 graduating class and next 
year’s 2017 class, according to 
a press release from Duggan’s 
office.

Private 
funding 
from 

the 
Michigan 
Education 

Excellence 
Foundation, 
a 

Lansing-based 
nonprofit 

organization, helped support 
the expansion into full tuition, 
MEEF hopes to raise $25 
million to support the program 

Instead of thinking outside 

of the box, University of 
Michigan 
architects 
and 

doctors are thinking inside of 
it.

A 
collaboration 
between 

faculty from the University 
Medical 
School, 
Taubman 

College of Architecture and 
Urban Planning and University 
Health Service has resulted in 
the development of a portable, 
box-like shipping container 
turned ophthalmology clinic 
that opened this month in 
Sandy Bay, Jamaica.

Geoffrey Thun, associate 

dean for research and creative 
practice 
and 
associate 

professor 
of 
architecture 

at 
Taubman 
College, 

spearheaded 
the 
project’s 

development 
alongside 

David Burke, interim chair 
of the Department of Human 
Genetics 
and 
professor 

of 
human 
genetics, 
UHS 

optometrist Joseph Myers and 
a team of Taubman designers.

The 
clinic 
— 
a 
20-by-

8 
foot 
recycled 
shipping 

container named “Common 
Health +” — was delivered 
and set up in Jamaica by the 
researchers and a group of 
volunteers last month. The box 
contains a number of eye care 
technologies repurposed from 
the University Health System.

Thun said the development 

of the pop-up clinic combined 

a number of multidisciplinary 
efforts, which began in the 
summer of 2015, resulting in 
a unique medical facility that 
could prove beneficial to a 
number of areas lacking proper 
eye care as well as other forms 
of medical treatment.

“As 
designers, 
we’re 

interested in what you can 
do to make the (clinic) not 
a container and how you 
can 
produce 
additional 

possibilities both for how 
it’s used by the community, 
but also in terms of the 
way in which you read the 
(container),” Thun said. “At 
the base level, it’s the idea 
of a set of technologies that 
is embedded in a hyper-
engineered 
artifact 
which 

then requires very low degrees 
of medical training to be able 
to operate.”

With funding from a Third 

Century Initiative grant — a 
$50 million, five-year initiative 
at the University created to 
develop new approaches to 
teaching and scholarships — 
the team also plans to ship 
eyeglass equipment to the 
Sandy Bay community. The 
clinic aims to allow patients 
to use automated technology 
without 
requiring 
medical 

attention from a professional.

The University of Michigan’s 

Giving 
Blueday, 
a 
24-hour 

fundraising event for student 
organizations, 
raised 
over 

$5.5 million Tuesday from 
about 7,000 donors. This is the 
largest amount the program 
has raised to date, surpassing 
last year’s donations by nearly 
$1.5 million.

Giving Blueday stems from 

the 
international 
campaign 

Giving Tuesday, wherein people 
across the globe are encouraed 
to donate to different charities 
the week after Thanksgiving. 
The event is meant to kick off 
the holiday season — a season 
that is marked by heightened 
consumer 
activity 
and 

purchases.

At the University, donors 

could 
give 
either 
to 
the 

University or to a specific 
school, 
unit 
or 
student 

organization. 

The campaign, first launched 

in 2014, has become more 
successful with each successive 
year. It raised $3 million in its 
first year, and just over $4

Dr. Khalil Shikaki, director of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, discusses possible changes in U.S. policy toward Israel and Palestine under 
President-elect Donald Trump at the Ford School Wednesday evening.

The 
future 
of 
diplomatic 

relations between the United 
States and the Middle East may 
not be in good hands under 
President-elect Donald Trump, 
according to political experts 

who spoke at the University of 
Michigan Wednesday.

At the talk, held at the Ford 

School of Public Policy to an 
audience of about 20 students, 
faculty and staff, the speakers 
focused on the tense political 
climate the next presidential 
administration should expect in 
regard to conflict in the Middle 

East.

Both 
Shai 
Feldman, 
the 

director of the Crown Center for 
Middle East Studies at Brandeis 
University, and Khalil Shikaki, 
the director of the Palestinina 
Center for Policy and Survey 
Research, 
acknowledged 
that 

their speculation on Trump’s 
actions in office could be proven 

entirely incorrect once Trump is 
inaugurated.

However, 
Feldman 
said 

considering 
the 
comments 

Trump made on the campaign 
trail, which he described as 
abrasive, he is uncertain of 
Trump’s foreign policy goals. 
Trump’s objectives include calls

Detroit City Council voted 

unanimously Tuesday in favor 
of an ordinance that will 
allow patrons of “pedal pubs,” 
or mobile bars on wheels 
powered by the pedaling of 
the patrons, to now consume 
alcohol on board in the city.

These 
pedal 
pubs 
are 

similar 
to 
“Trolley 
Pub” 

and other companies in Ann 
Arbor that also offer the same 
service. These pedal pubs 
have been legal in Ann Arbor 
since September 2015. 

In July 2015, Gov. Rick 

Snyder signed a bill allowing 
passengers of pedal pubs to 
drink on board, but individual 
constituencies 
are 
still 

allowed to decide at their own 
discretion whether or not to 
allow onboard consumption. 
While Ann Arbor has allowed 
onboard consumption since 
the inception of pedal pubs, 
Detroit had not until this vote.

More 
than 
100 
people 

gathered 
to 
hear 
Dan 

Gilmartin, 
the 
executive 

director and CEO of the 
nonprofit Michigan Municipal 
League, 
speak 
on 
urban 

development 
strategies 
at 

the University of Michigan’s 
Ford School of Public Policy 
Wednesday.

The lecture, sponsored by 

the Public Policy School’s 
Center for Local, State, and 
Urban Policy and the Taubman 
College of Architecture and 
Urban Planning, was aimed 
at educating students about 
placemaking, 
which 
is 
an 

economic strategy to boost 
city 
appeal 
by 
sponsoring 

events or creating interesting 
sites to attract a community. 
Examples 
of 
placemaking 

include areas like Campus 
Martius, 
a 
park 
between 

office buildings in downtown 
Detroit, and events that bring 
a community together like 
ArtPrize in Grand Rapids.

Gilmartin spoke primarily 

about 
placemaking 
in 

Michigan, focusing on how 
the majority of the state lacks 
the fundamental features of 
a lucrative place to live for 
young people. He described 
placemaking as improving the 
human experience.

“We found now that quality 

is life is where people are 
going and certainly where 
people with means and where 
people with entrepreneurial 
spirit and where people with 
access to all sorts of different 
things are going,” Gilmartin 
said. “So, it’s one in the same 
now about creating that great 
place in terms of creating a 
great economy.”

Gilmartin 
said 
college 

graduates 
can 
be 
more 

interested in finding a place to 
live before finding a job in that 
area. Citing the competition 
among cities to appeal to 
young people, he listed eight 
characteristics localities use 
for 
placemaking: 
physical 

design 
and 
walkability, 

messaging 
and 
technology, 

green 
initiatives, 
ability 

to be welcoming, cultural 
economic 
development, 

transit, entrepreneurship and 
education.

One of the largest challenges 

Michigan 
currently 
faces, 

Gilmartin said, is the lack of 
public transportation. He told 
the crowd about speaking to 
a friend who spent three and 
a half hours plus a mile-and-
a-half walk travelling from 
downtown Detroit to Somerset 
Mall in the metro-Detroit 
suburb of Troy using public 
transportation. The distance 
between the two places is 22 
miles — a 25-minute drive by 
car.

CLOSUP 
collaborated 

with the Michigan Municipal 
League, among others, on a 
Michigan Public Policy Survey 
that was published in 2014, 
showing that local Michigan 
governments have increased 
their 
use 
of 
placemaking. 

Between 2009 and 2013, there 
was a 60-percent increase in 
the number of jurisdictions 
partaking 
in 
placemaking 

activities.

“This is an area of growth 

in 
Michigan 
among 
local 

governments and the private 
sector 
and 
other 
non-

governmental organizations,” 
said Thomas Ivacko, CLOSUP 
manager and administrator. 
“It is a pretty exciting, new 
place to turn, I think, to help 
improve the quality of life in 
Michigan.”

Green Party presidential 

nominee Jill Stein, who came 

fourth in the national popular 

vote in the 2016 presidential 

election, requested a recount 

in the state of Michigan 

Wednesday. Stein has also 

called or filed for recounts in 

Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — 

all states that President-elect 

Donald Trump narrowly won 

that were crucial in securing the 

Electoral College for him. 

Following the suggestion of 

potential vote manipulation in 

the three states by researchers 

including University of Michigan 

professor J. Alex Halderman, 

Stein has stated she is pushing 

for recounts to ensure the 

integrity of the election 

results. Last week, a group of 

computer scientists and election 

lawyers led by Halderman 

pointed out the possibility of 

vote manipulation by hacking 

in these three states. The 

group consulted heavily with 

Democratic presidential nominee 

Hillary Clinton, urging her and 

her team to file for recounts, 

according to media reports. 

Though her campaign will 

participate in Stein’s Wisconsin 

attempt, she has not pursued any 

recall petitions independently.

Stein, who has also said she 

believes the use of outdated 

and unreliable machines could 

alter the results of such an 

important election and pointed 

to the relatively high number of 

ballots in Michigan without a 

presidential vote, has raised $6.7 

million total for the recounts in 

the three states. 

The first recount Stein has 

secured, in Wisconsin, is slated 

to begin Thursday. Despite 

Stein’s request for a hand count, 

a judge ruled earlier this week 

that the recount does not have 

to happen entirely by hand, 

allowing instead a facilitated 

process through a machine. 

According to the Wisconsin 

State Journal, Stein has paid the 

Wisconsin Elections Commission 

$3.5 million and will be billed 

for any additional costs after the 

recount is completed by Dec. 12.

In the petition filed 

Wednesday for Michigan, Stein 

is also seeking a hand recount. 

The state, which hasn’t voted 

for a Republican candidate since 

1988, was a surprise swing state 

this election, and Trump won 

by a narrow margin of 10,704. 

Michigan’s recount could begin 

as soon as Friday in the largest of 

the state’s 19 counties, followed 

by the rest. The State’s Election 

Commission has said it hopes to 

finish the recount by Dec. 10, and 

it is anticipated to cost anywhere 

between $2 to $4 million. Stein 

is required to shoulder the 

bulk of the costs, but what isn’t 

covered by the state’s fee of 

$125 per precinct —which totals 

to slightly less than a million 

dollars overall — will fall on 

individual counties.

However, state Republicans 

are opposing the recount over 

concerns that state counties will 

have to pay for any part of it not 

covered by Stein’s contributions 

and have also challenged the 

necessity of it. 

“Jill Stein’s taxpayer 

funded temper tantrum will 

waste millions and will not 

change anything regarding 

the Presidential election,” said 

Michigan Republican Party 

Chairman Ronna Romney 

McDaniel in a press release. 

“Jill Stein should withdraw 

her request immediately, and 

Michigan Democrats should join 

in our call for her to do so.”

over 
the 
next 
two 
years, 

according to its website. The 
organization did not respond 
to a request for comment on 
funding that has been raised so 
far.

Gov. Rick Snyder (R), who 

joined Duggan to announce 
the expansion, said in a press 
release that the program is now 
the largest program of its kind 
in the nation.

“Michigan’s largest city is 

now also the largest city in the 
United States to guarantee all its 
young people the opportunity to 
earn a college degree tuition-
free,” he said.

For students to qualify for 

free tuition to two- or four-year 
programs, they must earn at 
least a 3.0 grade point average 
and score 21 on the ACT exam 
or 1,060 on the SAT. Students 
must have spent all four years 
of high school living in Detroit 
and attending a DPS school to 
qualify for four-year funding, 
and at least their junior and 
senior years to qualify for two-
year funding.

From the 2015 graduating 

class, 183 DPS students were 
provided 
funding 
to 
attend 

college programs in Michigan, 
according to the Detroit Promise 
program’s 
website. 
Twenty-

three enrolled at the University 
of Michigan at Ann Arbor.

LSA 
sophomore 
Sidney 

Arrington was awarded $275 
in funding from the Detroit 
Promise in 2015 to supplement 
her studies. She said she feels 

the expansion of the program 
builds on the availability of 
opportunity for Detroit students 
to ultimately contribute to the 
growth of the city.

“I think the expansion of the 

program is an excellent idea,” 
she said. “Higher education 
is very important and it is not 
fair for students to struggle 
financially to pay for college 
when they are trying to better 

themselves and ultimately give 
back to society.”

In the release, Duggan stated 

that the Detroit Promise is 
important in enabling Detroit 
students to overcome boundaries 
that would otherwise prevent 
them from growing through 
higher education.

“This program is one of 

the 
most 
significant 
ways 

we 
are 
removing 
barriers 

to 
opportunity 
for 
young 

Detroiters so they can realize 
their 
full 
potential 
in 
life 

without the burden of student 
debt,” Duggan said.

Similarly, 
LSA 
sophomore 

Calahna Butler, who received 
financial aid from the program, 
said ability to pay tuition is a 
one major roadblock between 
Detroit students and higher 
education and expansion of the 
program will allow students to 
find new opportunities.

“It’s a chance for many 

students in Detroit to experience 
life outside the city,” she said. 
“Money is a major concern 
when applying to colleges, and 
knowing that they can have a 
chance at a four-year institution 
without having to worry about 
tuition is a blessing.”

In addition to ensuring the 

clinic was suitable for medical 
eye care, the team designed 
the container keeping in mind 
variation in climate zones, 
cultural 
practices 
and 
the 

potential for the container 
to play a social role in the 
community in which it is 
placed.

Kathy 
Velikov, 
associate 

professor 
of 
architecture, 

was 
also 
involved 
in 
the 

development 
of 
the 
clinic 

and said eye care is one of 
the focuses of Burke’s “Deep 
Monitoring” project due to its 
non-invasive way of assessing 
vision 
health. 
The 
project 

began with a goal of finding 
actionable ways to address 
chronic care needs in remote 
and underserved populations.

“A lot of people in remote 

locations don’t have access 
to 
vision 
care, 
they 
don’t 

have access to prescription 
eyeglasses,” Velikov said. “It 
actually reduces their quality 

of life, it makes them unable to 
work and simply by diagnosing 
someone’s vision and providing 
things like eyeglasses really 
transforms people’s lives.”

Velikov added the clinic is 

more than just a repurposed 
container; instead, it serves 
as a self-powering and self-
sustainable social space.

Recent Taubman graduate 

Dan Tish, who traveled to 
Jamaica last month to oversee 
the installation of the clinic 
prototype, 
echoed 
Velikov’s 

sentiments 
on 
the 
clinic’s 

multidisciplinary uses.

“It was exciting to see the 

clinic finally in operation at the 
end of October and start to be 
a hub for the community,” Tish 
said. “Every time we were there 
and the doors were open, it was 
like a magnet for people to come 
in — lots of times because no 
one in the community had ever 
received an eye care exam.”

Recent Taubman graduate 

Kallie 
Sternburgh, 
who 

is 
working 
on 
future 

developments of the clinic, 
particularly those that could be 
deployed in the United States 
for areas such as Highland 
Park in Detroit, said the clinic 
provides a longer-term solution 
to care deficiencies.

“Involving the community 

off the get go and having 
the container be such a high 
visibility point as a prototype 
for our first version of this was 
very important,” Sternburgh 
said.

the ability to drink on board 
provides a completely different 
experience.

“The tours in Detroit are 

awesome,” Goldstein said. “It’s 
fun to be in and see the more 
beautiful parts of the city. But 

that experience doesn’t even 
compare to the one I had in 
Ann Arbor. There’s nothing 
quite like cruising down South 
State with a beer in hand.”

However, 
not 
everyone 

is happy about the recent 
decision. Business sophomore 
Andrew Berman, who interned 
for Quicken Loans in Detroit 

the last four summers, said 
traffic in the downtown area 
is bad enough without pedal 
pubs.

“There are already a lot 

of traffic issues in Detroit 
because of the lack of funds 
for the city,” Berman said. 
“Those 
pedal 
pubs 
have 

gotten in my way before and I 
imagine that they will only be 
more obtrusive if people start 
drinking on them.”

Current 
legislation 
does 

stipulate that all pedal pub 
businesses 
must 
provide 
a 

driver with a BAC of 0.00 who 
directs steering and braking. 
Some 
pedal 
pub 
business 

from Detroit addresses safety 
concerns on their website.

There are currently three 

pedal pub businesses active in 
Detroit: The Michigan Pedaler, 
Detroit Cycle Pub and The 
HandleBar. Previously, these 
businesses 
operated 
around 

the alcohol ban by acting as 
a pub crawl, stopping at two 
or three bars during the tour 
to offer ample opportunity 
for their patrons to get a few 
drinks.

“It’s 
something 
that’s 

become quite popular,” City 
Attorney 
Melvin 
“Butch” 

Hollowell said of the tours 
in an interview with Detroit 
Free Press. “We believe that, 
with the restrictions in place, 
that it will operate just fine in 
Detroit.” 

Hollowell 
noted 
that 
it 

remains unclear exactly when 
pedal pubs will be allowed to 
offer consumption on board, 

as owners will have to apply 
for a license from the police 
department.

The 
pedal 
pub 
industry 

has surprised many with its 
popularity. Proponents of the 
businesses said they believe 
they offer new opportunities 
for entrepreneurs in the city, 
as well as help local bars who 
benefit from the pedal pubs’ 
frequent stops.

“They roll through all day 

long,” said Sean Harrington, 
owner of the Town Pump 
Tavern. “They bring happy, 
fun customers. They stay for a 
few minutes, have a couple of 
drinks, maybe have something 
to eat and then they move 
along.”

for increased immigration laws 
and registering of Muslims in the 
United States, which Feldman 
said he believes will complicate 
foreign policy negotiations with 
leaders in the Middle East. He 
emphasized that discrimination 
against 
Muslims 
has 
been 

validated by Trump’s election to 
office.

“One of my students came 

to me in tears, which had to do 
with the fact of the different 
atmosphere 
they’re 
dealing 

with,” he said. “There is now a 
green light — that was not the 
case before. If the relations with 
the Muslim community escalate, 
that’ll be something they’ll be 
concern about.”

Feldman said Trump would 

be “wise” to follow in President 
Barack Obama’s foreign policy 
footsteps in regard to the U.S.-
Israeli partnership, despite the 
criticism Obama has received. 
During his tenure in office, 
Obama has opposed policies 
set by the government of Israeli 
Prime 
Minister 
Benjamin 

Netanyahu, such as his approach 
to 
Iran. 
Feldman 
said 
for 

Trump to successfully navigate 
U.S. 
issues 
of 
international 

diplomacy, he must change his 
political outlook.

“Trump will now, in a way, 

have to totally change his 
mindset,” he said. “He has been 
accustomed as a businessman 
— therefore, he has had an 
emphasis 
on 
winning. 
My 

argument is that he will soon 
discover that the situation in 
the Middle East is not about 
winning. In fact, the biggest 
problem that Trump will have 
is not America’s adversaries but 
America’s friends.”

The speakers also noted that 

during the campaign, Trump 
spoke 
in 
opposition 
toward 

the 
nuclear 
agreement 
the 

U.S. signed with Iran last year. 
In recent weeks, a number of 
national security experts have 
publicly urged Trump to reverse 
his unfavorable stance on the 
deal. Feldman made it clear 
that he believes the president-
elect’s business experience will 
ultimately discourage Trump 
from undermining the Iran 
nuclear deal.

“Frankly, I don’t think it’s a 

legitimate option because as a 
businessman he would know that 
there would be no better deal to 
replace it,” he said. “There is a 
possibility that Congress will 
tear up the deal with legislation 
that violates the spirit of the 
deal, without destroying it. I 
don’t think it’s going to take a 
lot to persuade him that this is a 
really bad.”

Shikaki 
emphasized 
that 

there is a chance Trump will 
adopt a stance of neglect in 
regard to foreign policy in the 
Middle East, particularly with 
Israel and Palestine.

He said if Trump chose to 

ignore the current governments 
and policies in the region, 
it would further erode the 
current push toward a two-state 
solution. The two-state solution 
envisions independent Israeli 
and Palestinian states and is the 
mainstream U.S. approach to 
solving the conflict.

“This would be like giving the 

current government a yellow 
light to doing what it sees as 
fit,” he said. “A policy of neglect 
would mean turning a blind 
eye to the current government, 
which could be very bad.”

Shikaki said he strongly hopes 

the 
Trump 
administration 

will 
not 
drastically 
change 

the current method of conflict 
management 
in 
the 
Middle 

East, and will instead follow the 
Obama administration’s lead. 

“To continue the management 

efforts, he has given indications 
at times that he will try to be 
neutral in order to make a deal,” 
Shikaki said. “If he strays from 
neutrality, this would be the end 
of the two-state solution, either 
directly or through the policies 
that he would encourage.”

Feldman 
echoed 
Shikaki’s 

sentiment that Trump may not 
remain neutral about conflict in 
the Middle East but instead may 
ignore it altogether.

“It will take him some time 

for him to understand that the 
whole world is listening to what 
the U.S. president has to say,” 
Feldman said. “I feel this issue 
will not be a high priority for the 
administration. My impression 
is that he will have much more 
urgent issues on his plate. In 
the immediate, he has to figure 
out what to do with his domestic 
promises.”

Public Policy senior Ellen 

Loubert said she felt worried 

about 
Trump’s 
temperament 

when faced with important 
negotiations of foreign policy in 
the Middle East. She added that 
she appreciated the event and 
encouraged other students who 
have been thinking about the 
next presidential administration 
to 
attend 
discussions 
that 

promote 
diverse 
ideas 
and 

perspectives as often as possible. 

“It’s really concerning that 

(Trump) is totally xenophobic 
and uninformed,” she said. “It’s 
important to play nice with 
other countries because we all 
live on the same Earth. There’s 
no escaping that. It’s like a 
closed eco-system; you can’t do 
something without it affecting 
other parts. I’m glad that they 
talked about that, and really 
appreciated the discussion.”

LSA 
junior 
Mohamad 

Zawahra 
said 
he 
attended 

Wednesday’s event because, as 
a Muslim American, he wanted 
reassurance following Trump’s 
election. After listening to the 
panel, he said he is hopeful 
that President Obama will be 
able 
to 
give 
President-elect 

Trump advice on how to handle 
diplomatic affairs.

“It’s obviously scary at first, 

especially 
being 
a 
Muslim 

American,” Zawahra said. “I 
think a lot of what they said at the 
panel was reassuring because 
they made it all a little bit more 
real and they said that President 
Obama is going to take him 
under his wing and teach him 
the ways of diplomacy. It was a 
good to get a feel of what needs 
to be done moving forward, 
especially in the Middle East.”

In response to the possibility 

of 
President-elect 
Trump 

implementing 
some 
of 
the 

immigration 
policies 
he 

promoted during the campaign, 
Zawahra said that he has faith 
in Congress keeping the White 
House in check.

“It all comes down to me 

having faith in Congress doing 
what’s right,” Zawahra said. 
“The idea of such a law on 
immigration doesn’t feel like it 
can go through without a hiccup. 
Realistically I don’t think it can 
go through but if it did I think 
there would be backlash among 
the Muslim community and 
non-Muslims that would get up 
in arms about that and recognize 
it as a violation against human 
rights.”

W

hen I was 13, I 
slammed my thumb 
in the door of my 

mom’s blue Mini Cooper. In an 
effort to show her just 
how angry I was about 
our 
morning 
fight 

minutes before, my 
melodramatic middle-
school self got out of 
the car and slammed 
the door closed, not 
realizing 
my 
left 

thumb was in the way. 
I ended up breaking 
a bone in my thumb 
and crying in front of 
everyone at the bus stop. But, in 
a few short hours I was leaving 
the hospital post-thumb surgery, 
my left hand wrapped in bright 
pink gauze and positioned with a 
metal splint.

I am lucky. No, I am privileged. 

Not only did I grow up with a 
doctor in the family, but a family 
where having health insurance 
was never a question. Physicals, 
checkups 
and 
prescriptions 

were normal occurrences. A 
broken bone? No problem. I 
was rushed to the hospital and 
fixed at once, expenses paid, no 
issue. More than that, the rest 
of my life was just as privileged. 
I lived in a good neighborhood, 
attended a well-funded public 
school, had access to healthy 
food and parents with steady 
upper middle-class incomes. My 
experience may be similar to 
your own, but for others, good 
health and good health care is a 
different story.

As 
President-elect 
Donald 

Trump begins to fill crucial 
positions for his cabinet, he has 
spared no time in giving us a 
glimpse at his administration. 
For many, it’s like sitting in a 
waiting room at the doctor’s 
office: You aren’t sure what the 
doctor is going to say, what he’s 
going to fix or whether he’ll be 
able to fix it at all (or in Trump’s 
case, try to fix it). It’s waiting to 
see what policies will come out of 
an unpredictable presidency and 
how they will shape Americans’ 
lives. And of all the vital policies 
at risk, the Affordable Care Act 
is one that will affect millions. 
A running mantra of Trump’s 
campaign 
was 
repealing 

Obamacare. However, several 
days after winning the election, 
Trump altered his position on 
repeal, instead stating he’d keep 
some provisions of Obamacare. 
The ACA has been a highlight of 
President Barack Obama’s career 
and while its full effects are still 

to be seen, the legislation has 
dramatically lowered the number 
of uninsured in the United States. 
Republicans have long been 

against 
Obamacare, 

and now they have 
higher 
hopes 
to 

repeal it once Trump 
is sworn in. Though 
as 
a 
Republican 

president, Trump has 
his party members to 
answer to, he also has 
to answer to those 
who voted for him 
and those two groups 
prove 
to 
be 
very 

different from each other.

For the millions of Americans 

whose 
well-being 
depends 

on 
accessible 
health 
care, 

the 
possibility 
of 
repealing 

Obamacare, or devoting less 
funding 
to 
improve 
quality 

of care, is life-changing. By 
reducing 
affordability, 
you 

reduce access. Health care then 
becomes a privilege, something 
that only a handful of people 
get. Yet, health is not a privilege. 
According to the World Health 
Organization, it’s a human right. 
Health care is a provision of 
maintaining a human right. 

As many have noted, the 

biggest irony in Trump’s odyssey 
to the White House is the 
populism he ran on. Appealing to 
working-class and lower-income 
citizens, he essentially received 
votes from those who benefit 
the most from Obamacare. The 
ACA’s centerpiece is to provide 
affordable insurance to all by 
requiring 
Americans 
to 
get 

insured 
and 
simultaneously 

reducing 
adverse 
selection, 

which drives up insurance costs. 
Obamacare 
especially 
targets 

those who may not get insured 
otherwise due to socioeconomic 
status 
and 
insufficient 
or 

expensive 
employee 
benefits. 

In addition, widespread health 
coverage is a way to reduce 
disparities 
in 
health. 
Those 

who cannot afford to be insured 
and thus maintain good health 
suffer 
economically. 
Health 

is not a mutually exclusive 
component in our lives. Your 
health affects economic, social 
and emotional well-being. Thus, 
good population health not only 
benefits the productivity of an 
individual but of the nation.

The irony of Trump continues. 

The segment of society that 
gains the most from affordable 
health care is also the group that 
voted for a man with plans and 
an expectation from his party 

to repeal it or at the minimum 
reduce it. The New York Times 
highlighted this political paradox 
in a story on a woman who voted 
for Trump and the next week 
went to sign up for another year 
of Obamacare.

We’re in the waiting room now. 

We don’t know what path Trump 
will take on health care. His 
change from campaign to office 
leaves too much uncertainty. 
But, with a Republican majority 
in Congress, and the recent 
nomination of Obamacare critic 
Tom Price to the Department 
of Health and Human Services, 
reform is on the horizon.

At this point, we have the 

lowest 
rate 
of 
uninsured 

Americans in the last 50 years. 
Obamacare has made enormous 
strides in making health care 
more of a right than a privilege. 
In a Reuters poll, Americans 
viewed health care as the most 
pressing issue to be addressed 
by the new presidency. Yet, 
health care is only one aspect 
in the greater issue of health. 
Health care is a means to solving 
health disparities and improving 
population health, but it is not the 
singular solution. The root cause 
of health disparities between 
Americans doesn’t come from 
a lack of health care, but rather 
the social, economic and cultural 
structures Americans live in 
every day.

When it comes to health policy, 

the United States is an anomaly. 
We spend more money than most 
other developed countries on 
health care, but still exhibit lower 
life expectancy and worsening 
health outcomes. It’s a paradox — 
a paradox of our own doing.

I don’t believe we can depend 

on the Trump administration to 
approach health policy in a new 
way by putting more money into 
social services. However, these 
social roots of health disparities, 
lack of education and, most 
importantly, 
inequality 

in 
economic 
stability 
and 

employment, are problems that 
have been experienced by many 
of his supporters. Therefore, 
Trump 
could 
benefit 
from 

taking an alternate approach 
to health policy and working to 
mend the social factors that lead 
to health inequity by making 
good health a right and not a 
privilege for those millions who 
voted for him.

The future of health policy

Rational vs. wishful thinking

JINHUI CHEN | OP-ED

A

s 
a 
graduate 
of 
the 

University of Michigan, I 
have been paying extreme 

attention to the 2016 presidential 
campaign. My change from being a 
Hillary Clinton supporter in 2008 
to a Donald Trump supporter in 
2016 isn’t typical. I barely knew 
about Trump after he declared 
he would run for president. In 
the very beginning, I treated him 
and his behavior like a joke — this 
guy was so funny as a billionaire 
businessman. Like most people, 
the information I knew was from 
the mainstream media. I didn’t 
believe he could win the election, 
and his speaking style was quite 
entertaining if you didn’t take 
what he’s saying seriously. 

But things changed gradually. 

When the news outlets reported 
more about Trump, not in a 
positive way, I began to feel a 
little skeptical: Is he as bad as 
the media reports? I decided to 
do my own research by using the 
powerful Google search engine 
(thank you, Larry Page, you are 
wonderful) and listening to his 
speeches. I found out Trump 
wasn’t the exact image that the 
mainstream media painted.

What’s going on with that? 

He did say some quite politically 
incorrect 
things, 
but 
the 

mainstream media had a political 
agenda aligned with Clinton’s 
campaign 
strategy, 
spinning 

everything Trump said without 
context and even reversing his 
meanings — it was really like an 
American version of the Cultural 
Revolution — by labeling him to 
be “racist, sexist, homophobic, 
xenophobic, 
Islamophobic” 

while 
Clinton 
labeled 
his 

community of supporters as a 

“basket of deplorables.”

Unlike Clinton, who was busy 

meeting her big donors, Trump 
held rallies, one after another, 
and he really cared about the 
real challenges of this country. 
He came to hold rallies seven 
times in total in Arizona, and I 
attended three of them, including 
his rally for the primary election 
at 
Fountain 
Hills. 
Trump’s 

policies are all on his campaign 
website. I don’t have to agree 
with everything he said and 
indeed, I took an iSideWith test 
and only got 56 percent match 
with Trump and 36 percent with 
Clinton. I listened to many of his 
talks from different rallies and he 
knew what the American people 
really need and want to change. 
Unfortunately, his real voice was 
spun by the mainstream media 
and further incited by more 
misleading 
information. 
Race 

card, gender card, religious card 
became the tools to smear Trump 
and his supporters.

I don’t have to be a conservative 

or a liberal, but a neutral resident 
watching this great election. 
I wanted to learn something 
in this election, so I needed to 
keep reading and analyzing the 
information 
I 
received 
from 

the internet (not from TV). As a 
result, I predicted that Trump 
would win 324 Electoral College 
votes 
including 
the 
critical 

votes from swing states: 16 from 
Michigan, 10 from Wisconsin, 
20 from Pennsylvania, 29 from 
Florida and 18 from Ohio, but I 
was wrong on Colorado, Nevada 
and New Hampshire and 1 vote 
from a district in Maine. 

How could Trump win in a 

landslide? He really listened to 
the voters and the voters listened 
to him, too, and gave him a trust 
vote. But, where was Clinton? 

Even 
though 
Trump 
won 

the election, the media keeps 
misleading 
many 
Clinton 

supporters who have been long 
brainwashed by the media to 
believe 
that 
their 
candidate 

would never lose. They couldn’t 
believe their long hope resulted 
in nothing. They couldn’t accept 
a result contrary to the belief they 
held onto for so long. Protests, 
riots, emotional ventilations and 
the like are the only way they could 
express their disappointments. 
Nonetheless, could they step out 
of the box, their comfort zone, and 
empathize why so many people 
support Trump?

It’s quite pathetic to note after 

eight years of President Barack 
Obama’s 
administration, 
the 

law and order, racial tension 
and gender discrimination and 
many other conflicts are messed 
up. But how could you blame a 
presidential candidate, and now 
president-elect, for Obama’s toxic 
presidential leadership and the 
mainstream media’s faults? Now 
you are on the left side, and we 
are on the right side. Should you 
and I start a fight? What does 
democracy mean in this election? 
Since Clinton couldn’t win the 
election, please blame her for her 
own faults. If you want to win, 
please be prepared for the next 
election in four years. Attend 
rallies early, rather than protest 
or riot after, when you are too late.

In the end, right now, win 

or loss, this election provides a 
lesson everyone can learn from. It 
isn’t about “we won, you lost,” it’s 
about putting America first and 
how to make America great again.

A/PIA Studies crucial to diversity 

MICHELLE LIN-LUSE | OP-ED

A

s Asian/Pacific Islander 
American students and 
alumni of the University 

of Michigan, we are called to 
action as we witness everything 
we love about our campus and 
nation coming under assault. We 
are moved to join with and help 
lead the majority of Wolverines 
and Americans who say “no” to 
racism, 
misogyny, 
xenophobia, 

homophobia, transphobia, religious 
intolerance, ableism and bigotry 
of all kinds. “Go Blue” must be a 
rallying cry for democracy, for 
social justice and for science and 
education in the public interest.

We have seen a presidential 

campaign 
motivated 
by 

scapegoating, hatred and revenge 
manifest on our campus, as well as 
a campaign of domestic terrorism 
through white supremacist posters 
in our communities. While there 
are new threats we must name and 
confront, we must not forget that 
our fight against racist ignorance 
and attacks on campus, in Ann 
Arbor and in the United States goes 
back decades. Those in power have 
never guaranteed safe spaces for our 
communities. We are the ones who 
have fought and organized to create 
our own spaces of consciousness, 
liberation and solidarity.

That is why we need Asian/

Pacific Islander American Studies 
now more than ever. A/PIA Studies 
and Ethnic Studies were born out 
of the struggle against global and 
domestic warfare and oppression, 
when student activists demanded a 
relevant education that overturned 
Eurocentric biases and reflected the 
diverse perspectives and concerns 
of our communities. We are a 
product of that struggle, and no 
analysis of racism, intersectionality 
or social justice would be possible 
today without it.

When 
full-time 
faculty 

and employment and student 
involvement peaked in A/PIA 
Studies at the University, we were 
part of a nationally renowned 
program offering a wide range of 
courses addressing race and justice. 
We had engaged faculty whose 
activities extended far beyond the 
classroom and whose mentoring 
served our organizations and 
programs on nights and weekends. 
Though A/PIA Studies had limited 
resources, no office space and no 
staff, we worked with these faculty 
to build cultural and educational 
programs, including large-scale 
events such as the Out of the 
Margins 
activism 
conference, 

which drew hundreds of attendees 
from diverse backgrounds to 

address the social issues that 
impact us and the entire nation.

We had the incredible honor 

to learn from and work with 
community 
leaders, 
including 

legendary scholar-activist Grace 
Lee Boggs. Boggs taught us, 
“You cannot change any society 
unless you take responsibility 
for it, unless you see yourself as 
belonging to it, and responsible 
for changing it.” Education has 
been our foundation, as we have 
become socially conscious alumni, 
community organizers, educators, 
policy-makers, 
professionals, 

attorneys, health care providers, 
parents and much more.

We want and need for today’s 

students to benefit from A/PIA 
Studies in the ways that we were 
able to when we were in school. 
Since 2013, A/PIA Studies has 
been reduced to a shadow of its 
former self because of top-down 
decisions by administrators lacking 
proper knowledge and expertise 
to appreciate the program’s value 
and potential. The most dedicated 
faculty have been fired or pushed 
away. The classes and programs 
we built up have disappeared. 
Because of this, the climate for A/
PIA students and many students 
at the University has become less 
inclusive and more hostile. Our 
efforts to get answers and provide 
support for rebuilding the program 
have been tokenized and ignored.

The A/PIA Studies program 

was once a social justice leader on 
campus. Its professors were always 
at the forefront of organizing teach-
ins in response to national crises, 
supporting student organizations, 
advocating for students of color, 
defending survivors of hate crimes 
and sexual assault and holding the 
administration accountable to its 
diversity promises. Our campus 
and our nation need a renewal of 
that vital presence.

We are encouraged to see the 

LSA’s October 2016 Diversity, 
Equity 
& 
Inclusion 
Strategic 

Plan finally recognize that past 
leadership failures have made 
students, staff and faculty feel 
“isolated 
and 
disrespected 

based on their social identities” 
and 
suffer 
“depression 
and 

stigmatization 
resulting 
from 

a lack of understanding and 
compassion.” LSA has specifically 
acknowledged that “Asian and 
Asian-American faculty, students, 
and staff have felt left out of the 
conversation altogether.”

But 
we’ve 
already 
heard 

countless 
promises 
about 

diversity, equity and inclusion 
from leadership. This time must 
be different. LSA’s Strategic Plan 
does not in any way name how its 

prior missteps undermined A/PIA 
Studies, and its “36 Strategic Goals” 
do not commit to any positive 
steps to rebuild and promote the 
program. Three years of slow 
progress, inadequate measures and 
a lack of transparency are too much.

LSA and the University must 

recognize 
the 
incredible 
past 

accomplishments of A/PIA Studies 
and make it a cornerstone of the 
campaign for diversity, equity 
and inclusion. The University 
has the power within its grasp to 
restore national leadership in the 
field of A/PIA Studies. We call 
on students, alumni, faculty, staff 
and off-campus supporters from 
all backgrounds to embrace the 
following proposals. We commit 
ourselves not only to implementing 
these steps, but also to working 
with everyone struggling to move 
diversity, equity and inclusion from 
the realm of rhetoric to reality.

We call for the full restoration of 

the eight full-time faculty in A/PIA 
Studies who have been lost since 
2008, including the restoration of 
the courses, scholarly expertise and 
student mentoring that has been lost. 
We call for the University to meet 
the demand for staff, funding and 
physical space that students, faculty 
and staff deem necessary to fulfill 
the curricular and co-curricular 
needs of A/PIA Studies and related 
A/PIA cultural programming and 
activities. We call for a restoration 
of direct involvement by students, 
alumni, staff and community 
allies in setting priorities, decision 
making and governance of the 
A/PIA Studies program. We call 
for institutional structures that 
ensure the A/PIA Studies program 
has the autonomy to be led by its 
own stakeholders who are central 
to the work of the program and 
possess the expertise needed to 
promote its success.

We can never again allow A/

PIA Studies to be undermined 
by short-sighted administrators 
or department chairs who lack 
the best interests of the program. 
We call for the formation of a 
commission of external Asian 
American and Pacific Islander 
Studies 
experts 
to 
identify 

additional steps the University 
must take to become “the Leaders 
and the Best” in Asian American 
and 
Pacific 
Islander 
Studies. 

This commission must outline 
a pathway for A/PIA Studies to 
achieve departmental status.

‘M’ readying to visit ‘Roar Zone’

The thing about walking 

into Pegula Ice Arena is that 
even when it’s empty, it’s 
intimidating. 

And that’s not necessarily 

because of its looks — at just 
four years old, it’s full of 
bright lights and shiny floors. 
The part that is intimidating is 
the bowl — steep and crowded 
around the rink — making it 
anxiety-inducing 
for 
those 

who might not like heights. 
And that’s just before the 
game starts.

For 10 of the 11 freshmen 

on 
the 
No. 
20 
Michigan 

hockey team, Thursday and 
Friday’s games will be their 
first time playing in No. 
7 Penn State’s arena. And 
with the student section — 
nicknamed the “Roar Zone” 
— situated directly behind the 
goaltender’s net on one end of 
the rink, this could prove to be 
a bit of an eye-opener.

“It’ll be my fourth year 

playing here, and I’d say it’s 
definitely one of my favorite 
rinks to go to,” said senior 
defenseman Nolan De Jong. 
“It’s obviously very new and 
the facilities are nice, but 
I think the atmosphere is 
the best part about it. When 
tomorrow comes around, I 
think their student section 
is going to give us a hard 
time, which I like. One of 
the reasons you play college 
hockey is to have that kind of 
atmosphere in the rink.

“I think it’s going to be fun 

for the freshman. We told 
them it’s not going to be an 
easy rink to play in, but it’s 
going to be one you’re excited 
to play in. We just have to 
make sure we’re ready to go.”

The Wolverines, who boast 

a 6-5-1 overall record, will 
be kicking off Big Ten play in 
this arena against the Nittany 
Lions, who have garnered 
an 11-1-1 record. So far this 
season, Penn State’s lethal 

offense has almost doubled 
Michigan’s goal total (62-33) 
and has scored more than 
anyone else in the nation. On 
average, the Nittany Lions 
score 4.77 goals per game. 
They have also taken twice as 
many shots as the Wolverines, 
with 
618 
compared 
to 

Michigan’s 304.

Senior David Goodwin has 

made history for the Nittany 
Lions as one of 12 active 
players in the nation to reach 
100 career points, with 103. 
Freshman Denis Smirnov is 
also an offensive powerhouse, 
averaging 
1.60 
points 
per 

game so far during his career.

“They’re going to do the 

same thing they’ve done the 
last four years, I think,” De 
Jong said. “They’re going to 
put a lot of pucks on the net, 
they’re going to put a lot of 
bodies on our defense. They’re 
more 
of 
a 
skilled 
group, 

they’re better with the puck 
than they were last year. We 
definitely can’t have as many 
breakdowns as we have had 
in the last few games, because 
they’ll make you pay.”

The Nittany Lions have 

scored 
more 
goals, 
taken 

more shots and tallied more 
assists. It’s no doubt the 
Wolverines will face an uphill 
battle — but they also have 
higher percentages in penalty 
kills and power plays, and 
they have allowed the same 
number of goals as Penn State, 
with 26. Michigan will need 
to focus on defense and play 
to its strengths if it wants to 
do well against the Nittany 
Lions.

“We’ve had some drills we 

think are going to be helpful, 
but still when you get in the 
game, you’ve got to be able 
to play the game the right 
way,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “That’s our 
job between now and then, is 
just get ready to think about 
the game, think about what’s 
going to happen and then be 
ready for it.”

Butt wins Big Ten’s best tight end award

To cap off the Michigan 

football team’s best regular 
season 
since 
2011, 
the 

Wolverines brought home their 
most All-Big Ten awards in 
recent memory, with 10 more 
players 
earning 
honors 
on 

Wednesday night to bring the 
team total to 22.

A night after Michigan’s 

entire starting defense earned 
at least honorable mentions and 
fifth-year senior Kenny Allen 
was the second-team punter, 
almost every starter on offense 
also made the awards list. The 
only one who did not receive 
a mention was redshirt junior 
fullback Khalid Hill — the Big 
Ten does not list fullbacks on 
its all-conference teams.

For 
the 
second 
straight 

year, senior Jake Butt was the 
offensive headliner, repeating 
as the Kwalick-Clark Tight End 
of the Year. Butt’s numbers took 
a step back this season, from 
51 catches to 43 and from 654 
yards to 518. Still, he remained 
one of the Wolverines’ best 
offensive threats, a matchup 
problem for opposing defenses 
and a go-to option in third-and-
short situations.

After forgoing the NFL Draft 

last year and returning for his 
senior season, Butt broke the 
Michigan records for career 
receiving yards and receptions 
by a tight end. He’ll be one of 
the top prospects at his position 
heading into the draft.

All 
around 
Butt, 
the 

Wolverines’ offense flourished 
in its second season under coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh, 
coordinator 

Tim Drevno and passing game 
coordinator Jedd Fisch. The 
entire offensive line received 
mention, led by fifth-year senior 
right tackle Erik Magnuson on 
the first team. Junior center 
Mason Cole, fifth-year senior 

right guard Kyle Kalis and 
versatile fifth-year senior Ben 
Braden followed on the second 
team. Even true freshman Ben 
Bredeson, who just started the 
last six games of the season, 
earned a third-team honor.

The most improved player 

on Michigan’s offense, though, 
was 
redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback Wilton Speight, 
who 
punctuated 
his 
first 

season as a starter by making 
the third team. He finished 
with a completion rate of 62.5 
percent, 17 touchdowns and 
just six interceptions, putting 
him third in the conference in 
pass efficiency.

A shoulder injury suffered on 

Nov. 12 at Iowa hampered those 
numbers, but Speight was one 
of the Wolverines’ best leaders 
all season. He stepped into the 
starting job after redshirting in 
2014, backing up Jake Rudock 
in 2015 and taking almost no 
meaningful snaps entering this 
year. 

He spoke on several occasions 

this fall about how much he 
has grown in that time, and 
he’ll now be Michigan’s most 
productive player returning for 
2017.

Fifth-year senior wideout 

Amara Darboh also made a 
big jump, becoming Speight’s 
main target and totaling a 
career-high 
826 
receiving 

yards, fourth in the Big Ten. 
He overtook fellow fifth-year 
senior Jehu Chesson for the title 
of top receiver, though Chesson 
earned honorable mention from 
the media after catching 31 
passes for 469 yards.

In all, Michigan had 10 

players recognized on offense 
and 11 on defense, equaled only 
by Wisconsin’s 11 on defense. 
Ohio State, though it only had 
nine honorees on offense and 
10 on defense, boasts four 
players on each of the first 
teams to Michigan’s two. The 
Buckeyes’ J.T. Barrett is the 
Quarterback of the Year, and 
running 
back 
Mike 
Weber 

is the freshman of the year. 

Elsewhere in the Big Ten East, 
Penn State quarterback Trace 
McSorley beat out Speight for 
the 
second-team 
spot, 
and 

running back Saquon Barkley 
was the conference’s Offensive 
Player of the Year.

Michigan 
running 
back 

De’Veon 
Smith 
earned 

honorable 
mention 
for 
the 

second straight year as a senior. 
He led a rushing attack that 
finished second in the Big Ten 
with 223.3 yards per game, 
while the overall offense also 
ranked second behind Ohio 
State in yards and touchdowns. 
The Wolverines have not done 
that well in both categories 
since 2003.

Michigan to take Georgia Tech in ACC/Big Ten Challenge

For the first time in program 

history, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team is headed to 
Atlanta for a matchup against 
Georgia Tech.

“Georgia Tech is a great team, 

especially at home,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico in an 
interview with WKTA. “They 
haven’t lost yet. They’re coming 
off a win in (the Junkanoo Jam 
tournament in Bimini, Bahamas) 
and they won against their in-state 
rival, Georgia, earlier this season. 
They’re really off to a great start.” 

The 
Wolverines 
shouldn’t 

be fazed, though. The team is 
entering the contest ranked first 
in the nation in 3-point-field goal 
percentage 
(.455) 
and 
second 

in field-goal percentage (.518). 
Additionally, Michigan is No. 12 in 
scoring defense and has received 
votes in both the Associated Press 
Poll and the USA Today Coaches 
Poll.

Despite those numbers, the 

Wolverines (6-1) are coming off of 
a loss against No.10 Florida State at 
the Paradise Jam tournament last 
weekend in St. Thomas. Michigan 
did manage to edge out No.25 
Gonzaga in its first matchup of 
three. 

The tournament was the first 

swing of a seven-game away series. 

“We’re on the road again and 

our schedule is incredibly tough,” 
Barnes Arico said. “But we’re trying 
to make our players really believe. 
It’s going to make a difference for us 
down the road moving into the Big 
Ten Tournament, and hopefully 
into the NCAA Tournament, to 
play the schedule we’ve had.”

A large part of the team’s 

early-season success stems from 
Katelynn Flaherty. The junior 
guard was named to the Naismith 
Trophy Watch List on Nov. 30 and 
is averaging 19.1 points per game on 
a 53.6 percent shooting, including 
44.0 percent from deep.

Adding 
to 
her 
impressive 

offensive statistics, Flaherty is 
cushioning her stat line with well-
rounded performances, posting 
4.1 assists and 2.4 rebounds in 27.7 
minutes per game. She has already 
been named to the Big Ten Player 
of the Week Honor Roll twice this 
season. 

Flaherty 
is 
one 
of 
two 

Wolverines to score in double 
figures in each game. She is joined 
by 
sophomore 
center 
Hallie 

Thome, who also leads Michigan 
in minutes played (28.4) and total 
blocks (2.1 per game). 

The Yellow Jackets are 6-3 in 

the ACC/Big Ten Challenge, while 
Michigan is 7-2 all-time in the 
series. Barnes Arico, herself, boasts 

a 3-1 record. Georgia Tech coach 
MaChelle Joseph, meanwhile, is 
the all-time winningest coach in 
program history and holds a 60.9 
win percentage. 

The Wolverines will have to look 

out for guard Francesca Pan, who 
averaged 20 points per game in the 
Junkanoo Jam.

The Big Ten/ACC Challenge 

pits Michigan against a team that 
isn’t scared of fouling and playing 
physical, according to Barnes 
Arico. However, the coach doesn’t 
think the physicality is unheard 
of in the changing landscape of 
the Big Ten, between adding new 
teams and new coaches within the 
past six years to the conference.

Notably, though, Michigan’s 

bench has been outscoring its 
opponents’ bench in every game 
this year. Freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick, who was named 
Big Ten Freshman of the Week 
on Nov. 14, leads the charge, but 
sophomore guards Nicole Munger 
and Boogie Brozoski round out the 
effort. 

“(Georgia Tech) will try to 

pressure us and give us a different 
look than we’ve faced so far,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Full court, 
really physical. They go deep 
into their bench, and try to rotate 
people in and try to pressure you. 

“It will be a tough contest for 

us.”

Wolverines blow lead, fall to Virginia Tech

One week ago, Zak Irvin 

was putting on one of the most 
miserable performances he’s ever 
had in a Michigan uniform.

The senior guard fouled out 

after 
shooting 
2-for-13 
from 

the field and failed to show up 
mentally, 
committing 
eight 

turnovers in the Wolverines’ 61-46 
loss to South Carolina.

Fast-forward seven days to 

Michigan’s 
matchup 
against 

Virginia Tech in the ACC/Big Ten 
Challenge, and No. 21 in maize 
looked like a different player at the 
start. Irvin drained his first two 
shots, scoring 15 points in the first 
half.

But the Wolverines have only 

gone as far as Irvin has been able to 
take them, and in the second half 
the irrational shots and turnovers 
that plagued Irvin against the 
Gamecocks crept back into his 
game.

With Michigan (5-2) down by 

one with five seconds left, a miss 
on an ill-advised fade-back jumper 
would end up being the costliest of 
all the shots the senior has taken in 
both games.

After a pair of Hokie free 

throws, a 3-point attempt at 
the buzzer from redshirt junior 
Duncan Robinson couldn’t lift 
Michigan out of the hole. Virginia 
Tech (6-1) completed its come-
from-behind 
effort 
to 
down 

Michigan, 73-70.

“We were trying to isolate him, 

and they took him away a little bit,” 
said Michigan coach John Beilein 
on Irvin’s missed jumper. “We 
know what to do when they take 
him away and we didn’t do it. It’s 
that simple.”

Added Irvin: “It’s part of my 

game. I showed it through the 
game, I was able to make that shot 
two or three times. I felt confident. 
It was there all night.”

The Wolverines once held a 

15-point first-half advantage and 
a nine-point halftime lead. But the 
Michigan defense couldn’t stop 
the Hokies in the second half, as 

Virginia Tech was able to score on 
59 percent of its possessions in the 
period, while shooting 52 percent 
from the field and a perfect 12-for-
12 from the free throw line.

When Virginia Tech came 

within a point of grabbing the 
lead halfway through the second 
half, Michigan went on a 15-6 run 
powered by Irvin and Robinson 
that re-opened a 10-point lead. 
That would be the largest the 
Wolverines would extend their 
advantage in the period.

The Hokies ultimately closed 

the game on a 15-5 run over the 
final five minutes, with a smaller 
lineup led by Justin Bibbs, Zach 
LeDay and Seth Allen scoring 
the buckets in crunch time. It 
only helped Virginia Tech when 
redshirt sophomore forward DJ 
Wilson fouled out with three 
minutes remaining, allowing the 
Hokies to stretch the floor with a 
smaller lineup.

“They’re a veteran team,” Irvin 

said. “They made a run. You know, 
basketball’s a game of runs. We 
weren’t shooting the ball as well 
as we were in the beginning of 

the game. Basically, on defense, 
they were doing anything they 
wanted.”

With 1:46 remaining, Virginia 

Tech took its first lead of the 
contest off of Allen’s jumper. The 
guard put the Hokies up four on 
the following possession with 
a three from the top of the key. 
Despite Robinson sinking a bucket 
on the following possession that 
brought Michigan within one, 
Allen’s five-point spurt would be 
enough for the Hokies to pull out 
the road win.

“Thank goodness in my time 

coaching I haven’t seen too many 
games like there, where we 
lead the whole game and can’t 
make enough stops or finishes 
offensively to win the game,” 
Beilein said. “We just didn’t do 
enough — we’re back again, 52 
percent from the field, just doing 
some strange things on defense. It 
really cost us.”

Irvin 
ultimately 
led 
the 

Wolverines in scoring with 23 
points on 10-for-20 shooting. It 
was Irvin’s largest tally of the 
season thus far, but his eight-point 

second half saw him miss all four 
three-pointers 
he 
attempted, 

as well as the jumper with five 
seconds left that would have put 
Michigan back in the lead.

Robinson and junior guard 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
followed Irvin in scoring with 
15 and 13 points respectively, 
combining 
to 
shoot 
10-for-21 

from the field. Robinson was the 
Wolverines’ lone scorer off the 
bench, as just six Michigan players 
finished with points in the scoring 
column.

Sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner was the only consistently 
effective scorer for the Wolverines 
in the second half, scoring seven of 
his 11 points in the period.

Michigan will look forward 

to a matchup with Kennesaw 
State on Saturday to recover from 
Wednesday’s 
devastating 
blow 

before a difficult week when it 
faces Texas and travels to No. 9 
UCLA. With the non-conference 
season winding down, there’s 
no telling what sort of harm this 
loss could do to the Wolverines’ 
tournament résumé come March.

Michigan fails to take 
advantage of post play

After leading for the entire 

game, 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team was down four 
with under a minute to play.

Senior forward Zak Irvin got 

the ball on the left wing, and the 
stage was set for your standard 
college basketball heroics.

But no one in Crisler Center 

ever got to witness that show. 
Irvin dribbled the ball back and 
forth on the wing until the shot 
clock wound down, pulled up for 
a fadeaway and clanked one off 
the rim. A make would not have 
guaranteed victory, but it would 
have forced the pressure back 
on to Virginia Tech. Instead, 
Michigan managed just one more 
shot — a missed 3-pointer at the 
buzzer by redshirt junior forward 
Duncan Robinson.

“I really just wanted to drive 

to the basket, try to use the free 
throw line or look for Duncan 
in the corner,” Irvin said. “But I 
wasn’t able to get there, so at that 
point I was just really trying to 
make something.”

Irvin’s 
attempted 
go-ahead 

basket was just a microcosm of 
an issue that has been plaguing 
the Wolverines through their last 
three games: They seem to be 
flirting with the idea that they will 
live or die by the jumper.

And while the matchup against 

Virginia Tech featured a greater 
emphasis on playing through 
the post, Michigan didn’t use 
that 
strategy 
nearly 
enough, 

eventually leading to a 73-70 loss 
against the Hokies.

In the first half, with the way 

the Wolverines were shooting, 
playing on the perimeter didn’t 
appear to be an issue. They shot 
55 percent from the floor and 
connected on seven of their 14 
shots from deep. If that weren’t 
enough, Irvin, a senior wing, 
looked poised for one of his typical 

scoring nights, posting 15 points 
in 17 minutes.

Down the stretch, though, 

as the Hokies went on a 23-10 
run in the final eight minutes, 
shooting out of a slump proved to 
be a problem — much like it was 
against South Carolina.

During Virginia Tech’s run, 

Michigan shot 3-for-12 from 
the floor, and 10 of those shots 
came from behind the arc or 
mid-range. Of the three baskets 
the Wolverines did make while 
their lead dwindled away, two 
were layups that developed from 
cycling the ball down low.

Whether Michigan realized 

it or not, it had the answer to its 
problem in sophomore forward 
Moritz Wagner’s play to open the 
second half. The Hokies strung 
together a 12-6 run in the opening 
4:07 of the frame and without 
Wagner, it could have been uglier.

Wagner 
scored 
Michigan’s 

only three baskets until the 13:47 
mark, and he did so however he 
pleased. He took a defender off 
the dribble from the perimeter, 
flashed polished moves working 
in the post and knocked down a 
jumper to go with it.

“It was a conscious effort, I 

would say,” Robinson said. “Mo’s 
a tough player to guard inside. 
I think we’ve got to utilize him 
more moving forward. And I 
think he definitely showed his 
capabilities tonight — or a glimpse 
of it — and I’m sure you’ll see it a 
lot more moving forward.”

But as Virginia Tech’s second 

run late in the half grew larger and 
larger, the Wolverines resorted to 
their old ways. The Hokies went 
with a small lineup to close the 
gap and Michigan could have 
made them pay for it.

Instead, the jump shots kept 

clanging off the rim on one end, 
the basket got a little bigger on the 
other, and before they knew it, the 
Wolverines had squandered what 
was once a 15-point lead.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I grew up in suburbia. I went 

to Catholic school until I was 18. 
I wore a uniform, and I kept my 
hair short. Aesthetically, I could 
not have been a more accurate 
cookie cutter of a middle-
class teenager, and I was fully 
uninspired artistically — at 
least until I found do-it-yourself 
music on the internet.

My first semester at the 

University of Michigan, word 
got to me that Pinegrove, an 
incredible indie rock outfit I 
had found on Twitter a year 
prior, would be playing a space 
known as Lincoln House within 
a 10-minute walk of campus. 
In a feeble attempt to blend in 
with the local scene the night 
of the show, I put on a shirt 
that read “Pity Sex Is a Band,” 
representing one of my favorite 
groups that hailed from Ann 
Arbor, and began my walk to the 
space.

I walked quickly up the 

driveway toward the group 
of people smoking cigarettes 
out back, hurrying to escape 
the 
blustery 
fall 
night. 
I 

entered the door, paid whoever 
was 
collecting 
money 
$5 

while stealing glances at the 
blindingly lit kitchen behind 
them, and walked down the 
concrete steps splattered with 
chipping white paint. 

Surprisingly, the basement 

was 
fully 
finished. 
I 
was 

greeted 
by 
a 
cacophonous 

crowd atop a white linoleum 
floor, a bar topped with all the 
bands’ merch and flood lights 
attached to sconces on the wall 
that lit up a drum kit in the 
middle of a small space at the 
back of the room. I approached 
the bar to check out the T-shirts 
and settled on purchasing a 
simple design that spelled out 
“Pinegrove” in rotating colors 
for each letter.

The 
opening 
bands 
were 

skilled 
musicians 
and 

entertaining performers, none 
afraid to hold back during their 
time at the front of the floor. If 
I hadn’t been so excited to see 
Pinegrove perform literally two 
feet in front of my face I might’ve 
even been able to pay more 
attention to the opening sets. 
Sooner than I had expected, it 
was time for Pinegrove to play 
some songs for the enigmatic 
crowd.

Before their rise with the 2016 

release of Cardinal — landing 
them a spot on Lollapalooza’s 
line-up mere months after the 
basement show in Ann Arbor 
— Pinegrove performed songs 
off an album I had first listened 
to 
on 
Bandcamp 
entitled 

Everything So Far to a crowd 
of less than 100 people in a 
dimly lit basement. This is DIY 
music, its practitioners and its 
followers at their finest.

DIY music refers to almost 

anything uploaded to Bandcamp 
or 
SoundCloud 
by 
artists 

independent of a record label. 
It comes from every genre you 
can think of, and centers around 
music made by those looking for 
discovery or with the simple 
desire to share their work with 
the internet. In today’s world, 
artists are starting to depend 
less and less on record labels. 
Just look at Chance the Rapper 
— he’s doing it flawlessly.

Yet, beneath the glamor and 

fame of arena shows and highly 
produced tunes, there’s a whole 
other world of music being 
made by dreamers, hopefuls 
and 
imaginative 
creatives, 

performing and making music 
for the sake of art itself. It’s 
a world with important parts 
both big and small between the 
people who not only make the 
art, but also those who manage 
the spaces to present it. It’s a 
tight-knit niche of friends and 
fans alike.

What 
exactly 
were 
your 

favorite bands doing before 
playing shows at The Palace, 
Saint 
Andrews 
or 
other 

hometown venues? Most likely 
blowing up some basement for 
the price of gas in front of the 
passionate 
individuals 
that 

help these artists get their first 
major footing in popularity. 
Without 
these 
spaces 
and 

this community, many bands 
wouldn’t have the chance to 
even begin making a living 
through their art.

First and foremost, these 

artists need the basements, 
old churches and other homely 
spaces to perform their art. Sara 

Johnson, club manager of the 
Flint Local 432, a space where 
I’ve seen innumerable up-and-
coming artists perform, wrote 
in an email interview that, “I do 
this because kids deserve a safe 
environment in which to enjoy 
live music, the beautiful thing 
that it is. I’m never happier than 
when I’m at work, and not many 
people get to say that, which 
makes me appreciate it even 
more.”

The Local is a substance-

free venue — a true blessing for 
anyone who is as sick as I am 
of getting hit in the head with 
beer cans at shows — providing 
a stage for artists of all genres 
and a space for all ages to safely 
consume art and performance. 
It’s a universal notion among 
those who book DIY shows 
that they do it for the love of 
performance itself and their 
first priority is making the 
space as welcoming as possible 
to newcomers and veterans 
alike.

“It was really incredible to 

be able to host Empire! Empire! 
(I Was A Lonely Estate)’s last 
show,” wrote Johnson. “We 
love Keith and Cathy so much, 
and the rest of the lineup was 
amazing — all of the bands were 
ones I’d had on my ‘book @ 432’ 
list, especially Joie de Vivre 
and The Island of Misfit Toys. 
We sold out the show, the room 
was full to bursting with love 
(and sadness and grief), and it’s 
a night that will have a special 
place in all of our hearts forever, 
I’m sure.”

Now I highly doubt you 

recognize any of these band 
names, and that is absolutely 
OK. This is an introduction to 
DIY, one for those unfamiliar 
with this world of music. No, 
those involved in DIY aren’t 
“hipsters” or “music snobs” 
(all right, you caught me, they 
actually might be). Truthfully, 
their 
biggest 
concern 
is 

satisfying their hunger for new 
music and performances; it’s 
comparable to a book worm or a 
movie buff getting a fix on their 
art of choice.

The fact that Johnson has 

a “book @ 432” list is perhaps 
one of the strongest testaments 
to their passion for music. Not 
to mention the show they are 
referring to was one of the most 
emotional I have ever attended 
at the Local. To say the room 
was bursting with love is an 
understatement, as the typically 
strict line between fans and 
artists at mainstream venues 
was blurred into oblivion. Bands 
were 
constantly 
dispersed 

throughout the crowd, speaking 
with other artists, fans and 
friends. 
It 
was 
a 
glowing 

atmosphere 
of 
camaraderie 

truly unique to the DIY scene.

DIY music is also just as 

concerned 
with 
diversifying 

genres as it is with representing 
the unique identities within 
those genres.

“Punk 
as 
a 
subculture 

is 
known 
for 
being 

overwhelmingly 
white, 
cis, 

and male — and while the 
Local certainly doesn’t mind 
booking acts that fall into those 
categories, we’re disappointed 
every time we fail to represent 
women, people of color, and 
LGBTQIA+ folks on our stage,” 
Johnson wrote.

Both 
these 
efforts 
and 

popular 
bands 
within 
the 

scene, like Girls Living Outside 
Society’s Shit and PWR BTTM, 
show that any and all identities 
have a place within DIY music 
where they can thrive and 
have their voice heard. It’s an 
environment 
that 
embodies 

inclusivity.

In addition to getting details 

on booking shows, I had the 
opportunity to speak with LSA 
senior John Sciortino, whose 
band Bonzo often plays at local 
spaces in Ann Arbor and is a 
strong staple in the DIY scene.

When 
I 
asked 
what 
his 

favorite part about playing DIY 
shows is, Sciortino said, “The 
fact that you can go to shows 
and listen to music for free.” 
Taking a full shift away from his 
own work, he also added that 

“Some of my favorite albums 
and EPs have been stuff I’ve 
been able to download for free 
off Bandcamp.”

Obviously, music taste is one 

of the most subjective facets of 
the human consumption of art, 
but knowing that your favorite 
bands don’t care for your money 
only makes the listening all the 
sweeter. The lack of focus on 
capitalistic venture creates an 
evident lack of pressure on the 
artist.

Sciortino 
expanded 
upon 

removing a ticket price from 
the equation, saying they create 
inclusivity.

“Especially with donation-

based shows, and pay-what-
you-want shows, you’re not 
keeping kids out of clubs and 
they’re usually all ages,” he 
said. There’s a valiant focus on 
the fans in the DIY scene among 
both the artists and the people 
who manage spaces.

“I’ve always been bad at 

pushing my music,” Sciortino 
said 
about 
popularity 
and 

promotion. There’s a lack of 
desire in DIY to draw nameless 
fans, and a larger focus on 
meeting 
others 
with 
the 

same ideals while forming a 
community.

“Our experience in DIY is 

that it’s a slow increase over a 
long time to get to know people,” 
he continued.

But 
what 
does 
happen 

when your DIY music takes 
off? Should I even dare to use 
the 
word 
“popular?”

Jeff Rosenstock, a reigning 
forefather of DIY music and a 
musician whose newest album 
WORRY. has already appeared 
on multiple “Best of 2016” 
charts just this past week.

Rosenstock has been around 

DIY punk music for years. 
He’s been involved in multiple 
bands 
before 
finding 
more 

mainstream 
success 
under 

his given name. Yet, one of his 
most important contributions 
to music was being one of the 
first artists to put his work on 
the internet in a pay-what-you-
want format, and implementing 
the same model under his own 
label, Quote Unquote Records.

The 
beginning 
of 
DIY 

involvement 
wasn’t 
always 

glamorous for Rosenstock, who 
wrote in an email that “The 
first shows we played were not 
great. We played my backyard. 
We played a coffee shop up the 
street. We played a place called 
the C-Note Cafe. We were 
horrible and people didn’t like 
us.”

But 
this 
didn’t 
deter 

Rosenstock’s 
passion 
for 

performance, and he continued 
to play shows for the hell of it 
or for charity, another common 
theme in the DIY scene.

“I specifically remember our 

friend Dan putting together 
a benefit show called Cancer 
Sucks out in Babylon, where 
around ten bands played and 
all the money went to cancer 
research,” Rosenstock wrote. 
“We were kids and we weren’t 
even thinking about money we 
just wanted to play shows, so 
there were always benefit shows 
happening.” 

Rosenstock also wrote about 

now being on SideOneDummy 
Records, noting that even while 
working with a label, he hasn’t 
let go of his DIY roots.

“Thankfully when we were 

talking and I had mentioned 
that I needed total creative 
control, I needed to still put my 
records out for free on Quote 
Unquote and a handful of other 
things, they were down,” he 
wrote.

Despite 
working 
with 
a 

label, Rosenstock refuses to 
let go of his DIY ethos that has 
motivated him since his earliest 
shows.

And DIY’s ethos is certainly 

its most important facet. Hold 
onto your passions and do what 
you want to do. Give a middle 
finger 
to 
expectations 
and 

responsibilities. Let an artist, or 
even just a song, consume you. 
Let your emotions take hold and 
do something you love for the 
sake of loving it. If you’re afraid 
of taking the leap, Rosenstock 
even included advice:

“There are going to be a lot of 

people telling you that you can’t 
do it,” he wrote. “That you need 
an agent, a manager, a record 
label, that you can’t record 
yourself. A lot of the time these 
people are saying stuff out of 
love, so it’s hard to ignore them. 
But they’re wrong. You can do 
anything.” 

 The xx’s 
newest music 
video, based 
on their 
upcoming 
album’s first 
single, “On 
Hold,” begins 
with an intro-
duction to the 
small town of 
Marfa, Texas. 
The first 20 
seconds of the 
video features 
no music, only 
a brief succes-
sion of images: 
a lone, flashy 
tassel waving forlornly in 
the wind as it droops from a 
telephone pole, a typical sub-
urban home made complete 
with its pristine white front 
porch, a boy wearing a cow-
boy hat leaning idly against 
the hood of a retro car.
 Suburban, desolate and 
unobtrusive, you imme-
diately get the sense that 
Marfa, Texas is the type of 
town that seems to exist in 
its own isolated bubble; time 
is warped, and days pass by 
in a haze of hot blue sky and 
bad decisions made by bored 
teenagers.
 The video is simple in 
essence. It briefly follows 
the lives of a group of high 
school students, showing 
glimpses into their private 
lives. It’s a video made up 
of a progression of fleeting 
moments in time; after-
school cheer practices, hot 
& heavy shower hookups 
and lounging at local diners 

all culminate to form what 
could almost be a glossy 
American Apparel ad.
 It could almost be, but for-
tunately, “On Hold” is care-
ful to never reach that level 
of artificiality. It avoids the 
minefield through intertwin-
ing moments of humanity 
with the more heavily styl-
ized aspects. For example, 
the dreaded cliché of the per-
fect cheerleader waving her 
pom-poms around on a foot-
ball field is lessened through 
the addition of messy, yet 
wonderfully natural, black 
and white shots of a party 
teeming with beautifully 
imperfect kids. The majority 
of the rest of the video passes 
in a similar manner: a cha-
otic back-and-forth between 
the overly synthetic and the 
humanely natural. 
 Overall, the music video for 
“On Hold” is choppy, hectic 
and a little confusing (much 
like the lives of most high 

school teenagers), but it’s 
never overwhelming. A feat 
that has to do in part with 
the simplicity of the actual 
song: the combined sooth-
ing vocals of Romy Madley 
Croft and Oliver Sim add a 
gossamer layer of tranquility 
to what is already a relatively 
minimal background beat. 
The xx strip their songs 
down to bare bones, invoking 
a clean sophistication that, in 
the case of “On Hold,” works 
in their favor, allowing the 
corresponding music video to 
not become obstructive in its 
clutter and disarray.
 Although at times pushing 
the boundaries of superfi-
ciality, the exclamations of 
endearing, emotive sincer-
ity found in The xx’s novel 
music video portrays that 
an infinite charm can some-
times be found in the classic 
tale of naive youth living in 
suburban paradise.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

DIY MUSIC
From Page 1B

DIY music is just 
as concerned with 
diversifying genres 
as representation.

With the crisp fall leaves 

beginning to wither under the 
the winter’s first snow and 
Thanksgiving already a distant 
memory, we usher in a new 
season: squash season. That’s 
right, the time has come for us 
to revel in winter’s gift to the 
produce section. 

What’s 
so 
special 
about 

this particularly protuberant 
variety of seasonal produce? 
Though winter squash are 
actually 
harvested 
in 
the 

fall, they last through the 
cold 
winter 
months, 
thus 

warranting their name. The 
winter squash family packs 
an abundance of nutrients, 
including 
magnesium 
and 

potassium as well as vitamins 
A, C and B6, and they’re 
delicious.

Aside from their nutritional 

benefits, winter squash are 
incredibly versatile and easy 
to incorporate into a variety of 
dishes. Their sweet, mild flavor 
makes them a hearty addition 
to salads, grains, soups and 
so forth — or you can prepare 
them as a satisfying, healthy 
meal on their own.

Though 
the 
tough 
skin, 

daunting size and firm texture 
of this squash variety may 
appear intimidating to some, 
they’re incredibly simple to 
prepare. First, when buying 
squash, look for those without 
bruises or marks with the 
stems still intact and that have 
quite a bit of weight to them 
to ensure the best quality. 
Popular varieties (and some of 
my favorite) include butternut, 
acorn and spaghetti. These 
varieties can be commonly 
found at your local grocery 
store or farmers market and are 
fairly inexpensive. I’ve often 
bought mine for under a dollar. 
 

The fastest way to prepare 

them for cooking is to slice 
them in half and scoop the 
seeds out. For easier handling, 
cut off the tops and bottoms so 
that they stand up flat. Then 
lay them flesh-side down on a 
baking sheet greased with olive 
oil or in a pan filled about an 

inch deep with water and roast 
at 375º- 400º for approximately 
40 minutes (the cooking time 
may depend on their size, and 
larger ones can take longer to 
cook). Once baked, they can be 
eaten straight out of the skin, 
or sliced or scooped out to add 
to a dish. For spaghetti squash, 
use a fork to pull the flesh out.

When roasted, the natural 

sugars that give winter squash 
their slight sweetness help 
caramelize the squash, giving 
them a delicious texture and 
deep flavor. To get the most 
of this flavor, you can simply 
season 
cubes 
or 
slices 
of 

squash with salt and olive oil 
or take a more daring route, 
coating them in curry paste or 
sprinkling them with brown 
sugar.

But don’t take my word for it. 

Try these recipes on your own 
for a variety of delicious, easy 
weeknight meals.

Easy 
butternut 
squash 

soup

In the cold winter months, 

there’s 
nothing 
more 

comforting or soul-warming 
than a bowl of soup. And a 
thick, velvety butternut squash 
soup is exactly the ticket. Not 
only is it unbelievably simple to 
make, but it’s a smooth base for 
an array of flavors if you feel 
like customizing yours with 
spices such as curry or ginger.

To make the soup:
Roast 
the 
squash 
as 

instructed before, scoop out 
the 
flesh 
and 
blend 
with 

chicken or vegetable stock 
to the desired consistency. 
Return the mixture to a pot and 
bring to a simmer. Add salt and 
pepper and a bit of heavy cream 
to taste. Top with a drizzle of 
cream or roasted pumpkin 
seeds for added texture. Easy, 
right?

Baked lasagna spaghetti 

squash boats

Spaghetti squash serves as a 

wonderful base for sauces, or 
can be delicious all on its own 
cooked in a pan with olive oil, 
garlic and parmesan. For an 
incredibly filling meal, make 
these spaghetti squash boats, 
packed with savory italian 
sausage, creamy tomato sauce 
and tons of gooey melted 

cheese.

To make the lasagna boats:
Begin by roasting the squash 

as instructed above. While 
the squash is baking, heat up 
a spoonful of olive oil in a pan 
and sautée some crushed garlic. 
Add the Italian sausage (either 
ground or 2-3 links removed 
from the casings and broken 
apart with a spatula or spoon in 
the pan) and cook until lightly 
brown. Add a handful or two of 
chopped kale and sautée until 
wilted. Next (you can skip this 
step and opt for just plain meat 
and greens with your squash) 
add a can of tomato sauce, 
a pinch of oregano and salt 
and pepper to taste. Simmer 
of 
several 
minutes 
before 

removing from the heat and 
adding a splash of heavy cream.

When the spaghetti squash 

is done, remove from the oven 
and let cool for ten minutes. 
Scrape out the flesh and mix 
into sauce. Add half a cup 
of shredded mozzarella and 
some parmesan and combine 
well. Spoon the mixture back 
into the halved exteriors of 
the squash, top with more 
mozzarella and bake until the 
cheese is melted and slightly 
browned on top.

Not only are these insanely 

delicious, but they take comfort 
food to a whole new level on a 
cold winter evening. 

Roasted acorn squash
Acorn squash has recently 

become my favorite of the 
category. Their smaller size 
makes them easier to handle 
and they pair well with almost 
any variety of dishes. My 
preferred method of cooking 
them is to slice them in half, 
scoop the seeds out and cut 
them into about half an inch 
thick slices, then coat them in 
olive oil and salt and roast them 
for about a half an hour.

They come out of the oven 

tender with crisp, caramelized 
edges and a subtle sweet flavor 
— perfect for tossing in a salad 
with kale, farro and dried 
cranberries or pomegranate 
seeds. Or, just eat the slices on 
their own. They’re that good.

If you have any interest in 

fashion, you are likely familiar 
with Mallory Merk, whether you 
know it or not. The 16-year-old 
Louisiana native has been featured 
in the likes of Teen Vogue and 
Refinery29, with an Instagram 
presence deserving of that kind of 
attention. Raking in 35 thousand 
followers 
as 
of 
Wednesday, 

she has accumulated a photo 
repertoire like no other, featuring 
everything from bold street-style 
snaps to candids with her bud, 
A$AP Rocky. A unique middle 
ground between dainty redhead 
and groundbreaking tomboy, it 
would appear that Merk’s outward 
appearance is what propelled her 
into ubiquity.

There is more to every story 

than meets the eye, though. In the 
case of Miss Mallory Merk, music 
is what bubbles between the lines.

“I first started making music 

when I got my first family 
computer,” she said in an interview. 
“I was probably about 10. I used to 
make voice memos on my phone 
and edit them in GarageBand.”

I know what you may be 

thinking, and the answer is no. 
Merk is not another pretty face 
with a platform and a hobby. She 
released her debut EP, MM & HH, 
this past August at the age of 15. 
Produced by Dallas band Herrick 
& Hooley, each song’s bluesy 
undertones and quippy, youthful 
lyrics feel practically hypnotic. The 
entire project possesses a depth 
that one would never expect from 
a member of today’s supposedly 
scatterbrained youth.

“My inspiration for MM & HH 

came from all over my life, coming 
of age,” Merk said. “ ‘Puppy Love’ 
was all about literal puppy love. 
‘Gold’ was about my questioning 
if I’m ready or even worthy of 
what I’ve been given in this life. I 
always think, why me? MM & HH 
was about trusting myself and my 
art. Hunter Lewis from Herrick & 
Hooley told me once that without 
Alabama Shakes and Bryson Tiller 
there would be no MM & HH. I 
thought that was pretty funny, but 
it’s really true. I also draw a lot of 
inspiration from Amy Winehouse, 
Frank Ocean and ’90s R&B. ”

There is still an elephant in the 

room: under what genre, if any, 
does MM & HH fit?

“I have a term for my music I’m 

trying to coin,” she said, laughing. 
“It’s Trazz. Trap-Jazz music.”

All elements of this narrative 

point to one conclusion: Merk 
means business. The model and 
songstress is not old enough to buy 
lottery tickets, yet her resume is 
unparalleled.

“My modeling career really 

kicked off after I modeled for 
Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 2 zine 
when I had just turned 14,” Merk 
said. “I was so happy to be launched 
into the fashion world in such a 
beautiful way. My favorite memory 
as a model was probably having my 
face done by Pat McGrath and her 
team for the first time. It was really 
a dream come true. She’s a queen 
and an amazing artist and soul.”

It may be difficult to imagine 

a teenager juggling one career of 
such brevity (read: Kanye West 
and Pat McGrath) while trying to 
kickstart another. According to 
Merk, however, her two passions 
live hand-in-hand.

“Modeling has played a huge 

role in my music career,” she said. 
“When I do a shoot or editorial I 
like to push for the client to write 
about my music or to plug my 
talent and true passion in one way 
or another. Also, modeling was the 
original way that my face got out 
there and so popular, so I have my 
looks and ability to put my whole 
heart into everything I do to thank 
for the success of my music.”

Now, wait just a minute. What 

about school? Do kids still do that 
in 2016? Apparently, the answer is 
yes. Though we may never know 
how, Merk confirms that she finds 

time to attend an ordinary public 
high school.

“Balancing high school with 

studio time and everything else is 
really challenging,” she said. “To 
be honest, it’s almost impossible. 
If I can get real for a second, 
something is always lost, whether 
that be relationships, friendships, 
family time, schoolwork or a 
creative outlet. Lately, I’ve been 
feeling my friends slip away, my 
real friends. I miss them. I miss 
my family. I feel like I don’t talk to 
them enough.”

How, then, does our fiery-haired 

protagonist find the strength to 
move forward?

“Balancing isn’t the word,” she 

said, “It’s a pendulum. Swinging 
back and forth from being mentally 
healthy 
and 
making 
music, 

modeling, doing schoolwork and 
seeing family to the opposite. Every 
day is a balancing act for me, it’s 
very tiring. That’s why I meditate, 
pray and align my chakras to keep 
my head in the right place.”

Merk is certainly cut from a 

special cloth — a “Jane” of many 
trades, if you will. If she has come 
this far already, one can only 
imagine what she will be capable 
of later in life.

“In the future, you can expect 

the unexpected. Expect something 
you’ve never heard before. Expect 
my whole heart through my music. 
Expect my whole personality 
through my modeling. And always 
expect great things, so you can be 
happy upon receiving art that’s 
better than great.”

The story of Mallory Merk has 

only just begun.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Last 
summer, 
I 
managed 

to 
find 
myself 
cross-legged 

on a dock, overlooking the 
hazy emerald mountains that 
surround 
New 
Hampshire’s 

Lake 
Winnipesaukee. 
Sitting 

amid 
12 
other 
students, 
I 

awaited the start of an academic 
class that focused on the “uses 
of the erotic.” Did I attend this 
class because I assumed it’d be 
largely sexual in nature? Maybe. 
Nevertheless, in 90 minutes, the 
word “erotic” took on new, much 
more profound, meaning. The 
class utilized Audre Lorde’s 1974 
essay “Uses of the Erotic: The 
Erotic as Power,” in which she 
boldly defines the erotic as “a 
measure between the beginnings 
of our sense of self and the chaos 
of our strongest feelings.”

After familiarizing the class 

with Lorde’s definition, our 
instructor 
requested 
we 
go 

around and name what came 
to mind when we heard the 
word “erotic.” Immediately, the 
seductive beats of Chet Faker’s 
song “Cigarettes and Chocolate” 
flowed into my brain.

I’ve 
always 
chased 
the 

goosebumps, 
the 
body-

inhabiting emotion that music 
sends through me. I vividly recall 
being the only kid in the fourth 
grade choir who volunteered to 
sing the alto part of “Carol of the 
Bells”(you may know this part as 
the “ding, dongs”). While all my 
peers begged to sing the popular 
melody “Hark, how the bells! 

Sweet, silver bells,” I preferred 
dwelling in the harmony; it was 
easier to get lost the depths 
of the blending voices, in the 
depths of my own feeling.

It goes without saying that 

nine-year-old me did not identify 
my soul-stirring response to 
harmony as “erotic.” But, as 
Lorde describes the erotic, music 
has always been “a reminder of 
my capacity for feeling.” Thus, 
I turn to music to enhance 
the feeling of my everyday 
experiences. Music holds the 
potential to summon the erotic, 
and illuminate our lives with 
what Lorde identifies as the 
“kind of energy that heightens 
our senses and strengthens all of 
(our) experiences.”

The value in the erotic, and 

music’s ability to access it, 
stretches 
beyond 
individual 

experience. One of its uses, 
according to Lorde, is uniting 
those who share moments of its 
electric emotion. She accents the 
erotic’s ability to “be the basis for 
understanding much of what is 
not shared between us.” Emotion 
is humanity’s common ground, 
but it’s rare we allow ourselves to 
indulge in such rawness together.

I crave that rawness, though, 

and utilize music to ease the 
human 
connection-hindering 

fear of displaying intense feeling.

For 
instance, 
“Rivers 
and 

Roads” by The Head and the 
Heart has been the deliberate 
soundtrack to multiple “endings” 
in my life. The wistful harmonies 
of the chorus, “rivers ‘til I reach 
you” fueled the collective tears 
of my high school friend group 

before graduation — but only 
after the classic, “NO oh my GOD, 
this song makes me cry” remark. 
Though just a playful plea, it 
revealed the power music has 
over us, as well as our aversion to 
the vulnerability of the erotic.

Shared 
erotic 
connection 

doesn’t have to be somber, though. 
We’ve all been at that lackluster 
party that makes an 360 degree 
revitalization when that one 
guy puts on “Mr. Brightside.” 
Suddenly, the room is bouncing 
in nostalgic camaraderie to the 
tune of its infamous guitar intro. 
The night is heroically saved, and 
The Killers’ energy miraculously 
carries over into the night, alive 
even when that one girl (me) 
turns on “Macarena.”

Be it getting goosebumps at 

a choir concert, sobbing to the 
cliche “Rivers and Roads,” or 
head-banging to a dancefloor 
classic, both music and the erotic 
come in many forms — sort of like 
love. Lorde explains, “the very 
word erotic comes from the Greek 
word eros, the personification 
of love in all its aspects.” When 
we realize the erotic within 
ourselves, we’re realizing our 
deepest capacities for love — love 
for ourselves and love for others.

That tingly, wide-eyed magic 

that music ignites in me defies 
logic — it’s like momentarily 
falling 
in 
love 
— 
and 
it’s 

frighteningly vulnerable to feel 
so deeply. But when I find myself 
scared 
away, 
uninspired 
or 

settling, I know I have Chet Faker 
to tune me back into the erotic 
— Audre Lorde’s erotic — that I 
discovered on that dock last June.

Chasing the goosebumps and emotions that music sends through me

Rumor has it we’re ordering Pizza House. Baked and 

Buzzed have relegated me to be the Designated Orderer. 

Morale low. THERE SHE IS. Looking good Lizzie. 

Why does cartoon Lizzie have boobs? Is that really 

necessary? Remind me to never get bangs. And she 

has an iBook? Slow down. Little brother is spying 
on her in the bathroom?! This is some Freudian 
sh*t.

WAIT ... this is JUNIOR high? SHE IS 

DEFINITELY 20 IN THIS MOVIE. Mrs. 
McGuire looks like a young Meryl Streep. 
Gordo’s here! The original Chase Matthews. 
Gordo means fat in Spanish. This teacher at 

this “graduation” just referenced Ebola. Disney 

is always ahead of the curve. I remember being 

nervous for Lizzie the first time I watched her give 

her commencement speech. Now I’m in college and 

I’m laughing. Capital One ad in the airport?! I see you, 

propaganda. God, the little brother is still creepy. Two weeks in 

Rome?! With a high school principal whom the students have yet to meet? Sounds good. Buzzed thought 
the dad was hot at first, but now disagrees. I SEE FROSTED TIPS! Ethan is here! Gordo’s hair looks like 
mine. Why is the popular girl wearing a khaki pantsuit? Secretary Clinton? Disney was ahead, I’m telling 
you. Alright, look at the hotel room. It is covered in marble. IN COMES PAOLO! Kisses?! Oh, right, this is 
Europe. They’re drinking Pellegrino now. Imperialism lives. This milkshake is thick like Paolo’s accent 
should be, but is not. OK, wait. Paolo is kind of hot. This isn’t fair, the pretty girls get everything. Curse you 
Hillary (Duff, not Clinton, who already has that in the bag).

 “You’re such a good friend.” Oof. Poor Gordo. MY FAVORITE SCENE IS HERE. THE FASHION 

SCENE. IT IS TIME FOR THE IGLOO DRESS. Baked just said, “I think this movie exaggerates.” This 
screenplay was definitely forged from a Mad Lib book. In Rome, everything is marble. Did you know? 
Hold up. Lizzie’s family literally just got on a plane to visit her. She is only gone for two weeks. Joanne 
the Scammer would’ve swindled the heck out of this little girl. Also to be noted: no way did Hillary Duff 
receive any form of dialect lessons for her Italian alter ego, Isabella. But oh, my, is she steamy. It’s been 
revealed! Paolo is a diva! What a pickle he and Lizzie are in. One second, why doesn’t Gordo want to get 
with Isabella? 

PERFORMANCE TIME. Paolo can’t sing! Ha ha! Girls rule, boys drool, in every country! The emblem 

of modern Italian culture has been dismantled. Turns out Buzzed sang this song in the high school talent 
show. I am happy and you should be, too. Lizzie and Gordo are “sneaking away.” KISS! KISS! (I know they 
kiss.) She kissed him and he threw up the rock horns in response. Why has no boy ever thrown up the 
rock horns for me? - Tess Garcia, Daily Arts Writer

“The Lizzie McGuire 

Movie”

in this series, three daily arts writers 

in varying states of mind do the same 

activity and write about their experiences.

this week’s event:

Don’t remember this intro. Looks like some Agent Cody Banks and Cadet Kelly 

shit. Oh wait never mind it’s just Lizzie McGuire’s mean af little bro. “The tide 

is high” just came on and I highkey wanna dance and sing but I’m too 

high and don’t know all the lyrics TBH. The cartoon version of 

Lizzie has small boobs #why. I only saw this movie once 

in theaters in 2003 so this is hella nostalgic. Wait 

Lizzie has an iBook??? Damn the movie 

really is from 2003. Also why is her 

brother spying on her, like that’s 

some demented Hitchcockian voy-

eurism shit. Live action and animation 

mixed make me uncomfy. Gordo, what a homie 

#thatjewfrotho. LIZZIE’s TEACHER JUST MADE 

A REFERENCE TO EBOLA WHAAT. Lmao Lizzie looks 

like she’s 40 but she’s graduating from eighth grade AND she’s 

going to Rome?? Lizzie’s graduation speech is cringeworthy af. Fun 

fact: the woman who plays Ms Ungermeyer voiced Lois from Family 

Guy. She’s such a savage in this movie. Buzzed thought Lizzie’s dad was hot lol. 

The plane scene is cute, I’m surprised Gordo and Lizzie never smashed. Lol I just 

remembered when Lizzie first sees Paolo and he says in a shaky Italian accent “Isabella??” 

Europeans are so funny. The dialogue is corny as heck. But the cinematography’s not terrible. 

Wait isn’t Paolo like 20?! Kinda pedophilic if you ask me. Is his bodyguard always there? Bored said 

everyone’s sunglasses looked horrible before 2009. Exposition scenes are the worst. Paolo is such a shallow 
motherfucker, he is the original fuccboi. I’m laughing at everything SOMEBODY HELP ME. Never mind, 
Lizzie just said Paolo is 17, I still see several red flags. Gordo is so hardcore friendzoned. The soundtrack is 
bomb, 8.5/10 would recommend. I think this movie exaggerates the effects of mainstream media too much. 
My friend just said Paolo looks like Fez from That ’70s Show and I TOTALLY AGREE. Wait Lizzie just did 
a cartwheel handstand, stop the FUCKING panini presses. Damn Ms Ungermeyer and the bodyguard are 
lowkey fuckin, I feel like she wears the [CENSORED] in this relationship. Paolo’s line delivery is so FLAT. 
His Broken English is making my insides explode. Oh they’re singing the slow version of This is What 
Dreams Are Made Of fuck me up. Love the last performance, like Lizzie singing with the brunette version 
of herself is amazing. The kiss between Gordo and Lizzie was weak as hell but it’s ok cuz they’re both awk-
ward! What a journey it’s been you guys.

Damn I love this song … “The tide is high but I’m holding on.” 

Sing it cartoon Lizzie. High key though bless Hillary Duff for not 
becoming a trainwreck like some of the other Disney channel stars. 
I used to play the game boy version of Lizzie McGuire and it was 
fun as hell.

Why the fuck is Lizzie going to Rome for her 8th grade 

graduation I wasn’t even allowed to leave my neighborhood in 8th 
grade. Her dad is hot ?? maybe ?? I hate that Miranda is not in this 
movie. Bored is noticing stuff that I cannot pick up on but that’s OK 
she’s doing well. Gordo definitely smoked pot in junior high. Real 
question though: Where does Lizzie McGuire live?

I’m some Franzia and beers deep … Lizzie and Gordo need 

some too. Also Paolo is definitely 18 something years old and that 
is just pedophilia-ish right there. Also Paolo, to be honest, I totally 
would. Why can’t I go to some foreign country and look like an 
international pop star that’s so unfair. Drinking Pellegrino water, 
Gordo? That’s some bougie ass shit. Crap, we devoured that feta 
bread. Also, Lizzie is walking around the streets of Rome at 14 by 
herself, but I would high key be shitting my pants with my braces 
and American eagle shirt. THIS SOUNDTRACK IS BOMB WTF. 
Gordo is a good friend too, like why does no one go for the nice boys 
anymore ? Baked loves mentioning that Gordo is Jewish. Should I 
put alcohol in my Pizza House milkshake? 

Palo is a poser and I feel like I am the cartoon version of Lizzie 

Mcguire. This movie kind of has no point but maybe I’m just being 
cynical? Lizzie has a hot outfit on and Baked says, “she looks hot for 
an eighth grader,” and when did this turn so sexual? lol she falls on 

baked.buzzed.bored.

the red carpet. This movie is way faster when you are drunk. Damn Lizzie is in such a pickle with Paolo rn. 
God dammit Paolo you suck cheers to Lizzie and Isabella #girlsruntheworld Just remember they are singing 
in the Colosseum HOW. LIZZIE IS SINGING WITH THE BRUNETTE VERSION OF HERSELF GOALS, 
MAN, GOALS. But, is this is what dreams are made of? The booty shake IS the best part of the entire film. 
THEY KISS I REPEAT LIZZIE AND GORDO kISs. -Daily Arts Writer


“Claws protracted, but we’re not 

scratching / We boost each other 
up/ ’cause I just want to hype my 
best friends, man / I just wanna 
hype my best girls,” Sadie Dupuis 
sings in “Hype,” a track off Slug-
ger, Dupuis’s newest release under 
her solo project, Sad13. Slugger is 
self-produced and, as seen from 
the lyrics above, focuses heavily on 
encouraging positive relationships 
between women.

“The point of the record is cele-

brating friendship and prioritizing 
friendship and prioritizing com-
munities of support,” Dupuis said 
in an interview, noting that Slug-
ger’s sound helps to embellish the 
themes it strives to portray.

As she leaned back casually 

against her chair in the bar area of 
El Club, a music venue in Detroit, 
Dupuis’s multicolored hair shone 
like a beacon through the sea of 
dim lighting, as bright and as fun 
as the music she creates in Slugger.

“I’ve always liked pop music, but 

guitar is my primary instrument, 
and they don’t always go hand-in-
hand,” she said.

Even though the contemporary 

pop aspect of Slugger might have 
presented a challenge to her, it’s a 
struggle that doesn’t appear in the 
finished music; every song has a 
natural, easy-going flow that trans-
forms the album into an airy work 
of art as enjoyable to listen to as it 
is well composed. The subtle R&B 
aspects found in “Devil In U” flow 
smoothly into the more synthetic 
electronic components of “Kram-
pus (In Love)” which, in turn, is 
juxtaposed perfectly next to the 
more direct, driven beat of “Hype.”

Throughout Slugger, Dupuis 

imperceptibly 
shifts 
between 

slightly differing styles of music. 
The album is only held consistent 
because it never falters in deliver-
ing upbeat, buoyant songs, a feat 
that has something to do with the 
fact that Dupuis went into the cre-
ation of Slugger with the sole desire 
to create a pop album.

“I knew I wanted (Slugger) to 

be a pop record … some of the lyri-
cal concepts, I don’t know if I had 
a clear sense of that when I started 
it, just that I was doing a pop record 
and as I kept writing, it turned into 
what it is,” Dupuis said.

And “what it is” turns out to be a 

lighthearted procession of optimis-
tic songs that are both structurally 
and thematically similar.

“(Slugger) was written sort of 

quickly. I tried to do a song a day for 
two weeks … the thematic concepts 
of the songs relate to one another 
because they were all done so close 
to one another,” she said.

The ambitiously speedy con-

ception of Slugger not only helped 
the album’s unity but also allowed 
it to become a cohesive piece that 
advocates for positive, healthy 
interactions within the realm of 
significant others, friends and even 
within the music industry itself.

“I’ve always gravitated more 

towards music that has something 

to say … I’m not really interested in 
lyrics that are vacant,” Dupuis said.

Slugger is anything but vacant in 

the way lyrics directly addressing 
the importance of non-destructive 
female friendships are master-
fully interwoven between Dupuis’s 
more personal accounts of regain-
ing strength from past abusive 
relationships. But this album isn’t 
a story of recovery; it’s a story of 
optimism, told through the vibrant 
cover art, lively harmonies and 
animated vocals. Sadie Dupuis has 
created an album that not only cel-
ebrates life but, most importantly, 
celebrates constructive interac-
tions in life, a concept that can be 
difficult to find in the cutthroat 
world of music.

Difficult but not impossible, 

as Dupuis herself is constantly 
inspired by a wide variety of influ-
ential female artists who are both 
currently relevant and/or iconic.

“Grimes’s … (Art Angels) came 

out last October/November, then 
I recorded (Slugger) in January,” 
Dupuis said. “I was definitely pret-
ty excited about that record at the 
time. I was listening to Solange … 
and then certainly there’s a lot of 
sort of backing vocal harmony stuff 
that I maybe take from liking mid 
to late ’90s R&B. Or girl groups 
like TLC, Destiny’s Child were 
pretty huge for me, as a kid.” 

Like many of her inspirations, 

Dupuis commemorates powerful 
women in her songs through pro-
viding a non-toxic space where 
topics like uplifting female friend-
ships and the importance of not 
being afraid to take charge are 
pushed into the spotlight.

“Writing a pop album, I think 

my lyrics are always sort of in 
conversation with pop culture,” 
Dupuis said. “I almost felt like I 
was trying to undo some of the … 
negative concepts.”

Dupuis made Slugger into a pop 

album not only as a way to explore 
her sound in distinctive genres but 
also as an effort to negate the more 
harmful rhetoric toward women 
and derogatory images of women 
that can be found in many other 
pop songs (hello Robin Thicke). 
It’s an understated sort of rebel-
lion that can be seen in a variety 
of different music genres, but most 
significantly visible through the 
passionate feminist punk rock of 
riot grrrl, which Slugger shares 
some ideas with.

Riot grrrl bands like Bikini 

Kill and Sleater-Kinney helped 
establish a feminist movement 

in the early ’90s that focused on 
female empowerment and allowed 
women to express themselves, in 
all their angry glory, the same way 
their male counterparts had been 
doing for many years. The riot 
grrrl wave eventually moved past 
music and evolved into a larger 
subculture. Through DIY art, such 
as zines, and activism that focused 
on ending racism, homophobia 
and sexism, riot grrrl music pio-
neered inclusion of women in the 
punk scene and also permanently 
influenced the larger fabric of 
society.

Although quintessential riot 

grrrl bands have become signifi-
cantly less prevalent since their 
conception, the overall messages 
of inclusivity, liberation from dam-
aging social gender norms and 
support for other female artists 
that these bands preached have 
not disappeared. Instead, these 
ideas have spread throughout the 
music sphere over time, influenc-
ing artists of various genres both 
directly and indirectly.

Sad13 exemplifies this evolu-

tion. Even though the neat, pol-
ished Slugger is a far cry from the 
messy, underground style of iconic 
riot grrrl songs like “Rebel Girl,” 
the themes of these two contrast-
ing pieces parallel one another; the 
same encouragement of women to 
take pride in both their femininity 
and how they choose to express it 
that was screamed out with pride 
in the ’90s is seen, modernized 
and with a contemporary twist, 
in songs like “<2” or “Coming Into 
Powers” out of Slugger.

Above all, what the bands of the 

riot grrrl era inspired and what 
their modern-day counterparts 
continue to uphold is a space where 
women are not torn down but rath-
er supported wholeheartedly as 
they explore personal expression 
in music.

The fact that riot grrrl hasn’t 

died, only been transformed and 
customized as the years passed, 
truly epitomizes the transcendent 
quality of music. The ability to turn 
on the radio and listen to songs that 
motivate, inspire and empower 
women is and will always be need-
ed. As seen with riot grrrl’s lasting 
significance, music, much like all 
other forms of artistic expression, 
has the power to ingrain itself in 
the very core of a society, going 
beyond solely entertainment for 
entertainment’s sake in order to 
produce enduring social reform.

On Thursday, Nov. 17, The 

Maize Collective sponsored 
an event at the Michigan 
Union with touring rappers 
Machine Gun Kelly and Mod 
Sun, who spoke to students 
and guests alike about the ins 
and outs of the production and 
performance of hip hop. MGK 
covered topics from growing 
up poor, getting picked on 
as a kid and his supposedly 
grand contributions to hip-
hop performance, while Mod 
Sun 
brought 
his 
signature 

positivity 
along 
with 
the 

occasional witty comment.

Maize Collective is a new 

student-run record label on 
campus that is designed to 
foster a community among 
students interested in music 
production, mixing, publicity 
and everything in between. 
Along 
with 
extracurricular 

involvement, they also offer a 
for-credit course through the 
University. The group’s goal is 
to create resources for students 
with multiple interests within 
the music industry. 

At the panel, MGK embodied 

stardom, donning hot pink 
corduroy pants and a white 
overcoat — nearly a complete 
opposite to Mod Sun’s relaxed 
vibes. 
With 
the 
dominant 

personality, he barely paused 
between 
sentences 
for 
a 

breath, making it clear from 
the start that music isn’t just 
a hobby, it’s his entire life, and 
saying “Music is God to me,” at 
one point.

He described how, through 

being 
bullied 
in 
a 
tough 

neighborhood, he found his 
roots in music.

“How I got in the game was 

me being picked on and lashing 
out,” he said.

His creative outlet has been 

anger — an anger which has 

skyrocketed him to fame. On 
the other hand, his tourmate 
Mod Sun is known for his 
positivity.

To Mod Sun, MGK said, 

“Tell them how you became 
happy all the time.”

“Just smile for five seconds, 

and you’ll feel better,” Mod Sun 
replied.

This marked Mod Sun’s 

unfortunately limited time on 
the mic, giving the audience 
short quips on happiness and 
his view of making music.

“You can create your own 

reality, 
your 
own 
world,” 

Mod Sun said on his creative 
process. As similar as the 
artists’ musical styles are, 
their views on music creation 
are starkly different.

MGK’s 
next 
topic 

— 
performance 
— 
was 

particularly heated. Likening 
himself to Kendrick Lamar 
and J. Cole, he claimed his 
own 
contributions 
to 
live 

performance 
were 
vital 

to the state of modern hip 
hop, and that he is vastly 
underappreciated, 
but 
also 

acknowledged that his live 
performances aren’t always 
perfect.

“I’m on top of you, put your 

phones 
away,” 
MGK 
said, 

voicing his frustrations with 
today’s 
concert-goers. 
Like 

many musicians in today’s 
world, he’s more interested in 
connecting with fans eye-to-
eye than through a screen.

“Stop 
letting 
everyone 

into our culture. It’s not for 
everyone,” MGK added on 
today’s hip-hop scene. Hip 
hop is clearly more than a 
genre to him; it’s become a 
lifestyle of which he’s very 
protective. 
This 
exclusivity 

he associates with hip hop 
highlights another belief of 
his — protectiveness over his 
musical voice.

“You don’t sign up as an 

artist, a true artist, for the 
liquidity of what your art is,” 
he said.

MGK 
also 
revealed 

his disdain for his single 
“Invincible,” 
written 
for 

a 
Beats 
commercial 
— 
a 

capitalistic venture he was 
far from happy about. He 
explained that it was a song 
he had little involvement in 
making, ultimately leading him 
to hate the end result.

“I walked into every radio 

station and said ‘this shit 
sucks,’ ” he said.

As far as production goes, 

MGK said his highest priority 
is full musical involvement 
from the artist, regardless of 
the money involved.

“Let a guitar chord hit 

that perfect spot,” MGK said, 
which turned out to perfectly 
summarize the event. In all 
aspects of the music industry, 
it’s important for the music 
to feel right not only to the 
audience, but to the artist as 
well. MGK loves what he does, 
and he isn’t afraid to voice his 
strong opinions on the matter.

“It sucks I have to be angry 

to write a great record,” he 
added, a powerful reflection on 
the individuality of someone’s 
driving force for creativity. 
Above all else, Thursday’s 
panel showed MGK is going 
to continue to emphasize the 
importance of remaining true 
to himself as a musician while 
staying connected with the 
fans through his passionate 
performances.

Hip hop and happiness at the Union

Touring rappers Machine Gun Kelly and Mod Sun talk music production

 It’s a common miscon-
ception that a song has to be 
original, break some barrier 
and sound like nothing on 
the market at that time in 
order to be good. “I Feel It 
Coming” is definitely the 
poster child for classic-
sounding, comfortable mod-
ern music.
 The song is a combination 
of the Weeknd’s crooning, 
soulful vocals and the synth-
disco heaven that the whole 
world loved for Daft Punk’s 
2013 collaboration with 

Pharrell and Nile Rodgers. 
The beat thrums through-
out the entire length of the 
track, and the Weeknd’s 
voice is always gentle, never 
more than a sweet conversa-
tional level. This isn’t to say 
there isn’t passion. It’s beau-
tiful in its understatement 
and blends together with the 
reproachful lyrics to create 
something that is a joy to 
listen to.
 The lyrics are sensual and 
provocative, yet soothing, 
and all this while being 
something that you won’t 
possibly be able to get out of 
your head. Daft Punk sprin-
kles eclectic electronica 
throughout the track, keep-
ing it up tempo and mostly 
very cool. This is a beauti-

ful collaboration, where 
neither outshine the other 
and instead work together 
to make a song that’s all the 
better for both inputs.
 Of course, it all sounds like 
something that has been 
written before several hun-
dred times. This could very 
easily be a Michael Jackson 
hit, just with a far more 
advanced production value. 
Still, it’s hard to fault a song 
when it’s doing everything it 
does so very well, and when 
nothing to this standard on 
a joint effort has been pro-
duced since “Get Lucky” was 
around. “I Feel It Coming” 
just proves how important 
these two artists are in the 
modern-day music scene.
