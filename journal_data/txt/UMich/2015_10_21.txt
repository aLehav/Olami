Former SAM 

president, treasurer 
could face jail time

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Repoter

The case against two former 

fraternity 
members 
involved 

in the January destruction of a 
Northern Michigan ski resort will 
appear before a jury next month, 
according to Otsego County Pros-
ecutor Michael Rola.

Business juniors Joshua Kaplan 

and Zachary Levin, the former 
Sigma Alpha Mu president and 
treasurer, are scheduled to appear 
in front of a jury in the 87A district 
court of Gaylord, Mich. on Nov. 18. 
They each are charged with two 
counts of furnishing a place for 
the consumption of alcohol and/
or controlled substances on the 
premises by minors. It was previ-
ously undeterminedwhether they 
would reach a plea agreement or 
stand trial.

If found guilty, Rola said the 

two could face penalties of up 
to 30 days in jail and $1,000 per 
offense. The court can also order 
them to help pay restitution to 
Treetops ski resort.

Kaplan and Levin join two 

other former SAM members, Uni-
versity alums Jesse Krumholz 
and Matthew Vlasic, who all were 
charged following the ski trip 
destruction. Krumholz received 
two years of probation for a mis-
demeanor charge in October, and 
Vlasic received two years proba-
tion for malicious destruction of 
property totaling more than $200 
but less than $1,000.

The vandalism took place dur-

ing a ski trip with Sigma Delta Tau 
sorority. Treetops alleges Univer-
sity students caused $200,000 
worth of damages to the property, 
on top of lost revenue.

Following the incident, the 

University decided it would no 
longer recognize the fraternity, 
and the national SAM organiza-
tion later opted to disband the 
chapter.

CRIME

Error on punt gives 
Michigan State the 

victory

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

One-hundred 
and 
eleven 

thousand stunned sets of eyes 

stared at the field below. A sea of 
green and white flooded into the 
northwest corner of the field.

For five whole minutes, no one 

else in Michigan Stadium moved.

None of those eyes had ever 

seen a game end like that before, 
and likely never will again.

Michigan State 27, Michigan 

23.

In a game that featured eight 

official reviews — including four 
on scoring plays — plenty of calls 
and non-calls that drew boos 
from the crowd and referees 
even admitting they messed up 
with their microphones on, the 
Michigan football team’s game 
against No. 7 Michigan State 
added an odd and awkward twist 
to the historic rivalry.

So it was only fitting that the 

game ended in never-before-
seen fashion when fifth-year 
senior punter Blake O’Neill — a 
hero earlier in the game for an 
80-yard punt — couldn’t turn 
a low snap into what should 
have been a game-sealing punt, 
instead giving Michigan State 
the ball for a 38-yard touchdown 
return as time expired.

Council also floats 

plan to relocate 
historic Arthur 
Miller house

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor City Council 

met Monday to discuss the city’s 
deer population, the future of 
the Arthur Miller house and a 
proposed zoning change to make 
way for a new housing develop-
ment.

Council to convene public 

meeting on deer cull

Multiple 
individuals 
con-

cerned about the city’s plan to 
control deer population in the 
city through a cull attended Mon-
day’s meeting, prompting the 
council to set an open hearing on 
the subject for Nov. 5.

Members of the council men-

tioned the volume of e-mails they 
received regarding the issue, and 
noted the lack of understanding 
of the issue apparent in many of 
them.

“It’s 
really 
difficult 
when 

e-mails keep coming with total 
misinformation,” said Council-
member Sumi Kailasapathy (D–
Ward 1). “It’s like they believe 
that someone is going to run 
around the park just shooting. It’s 
ridiculous.”

Several members agreed on 

the importance of having an 
informed public on the matter at 
hand.

Councilmember Jane Lumm 

(I–Ward 2) said the problem 
might be that the public is learn-
ing about the issue from outside 
sources that spread false infor-
mation.

“It’s unfortunate because a lot 

of what’s contained in those ini-
tial messages to people is not cor-
rect,” she said.

Relocation of the Arthur 

Miller house

The council passed a resolu-

tion to investigate the possibil-
ity of moving the Arthur Miller 
House from its current location 
on South Division Street to Lib-
erty Plaza.

rently owns the house, aims

Team Michigan, 
Team MSU collect 
more than $30,000 
during competition

Daily Staff Reporter

Though the Michigan foot-

ball team lost to Michigan State 

University on the field Satur-
day, Team Michigan defeated 
Team MSU in a face-off raising 
money to test untested rape kits 
in Detroit.

Five years ago, more than 

11,000 untested rape kits were 
found in a police warehouse in 
Detroit. Though most of these 
kits have now been sent out for 
testing, a campaign called the 
African American 490 Chal-
lenge has begun to raise money 

for the roughly 1,000 remaining 
untested kits. For Oct. 12 to Oct. 
17, teams of professionals who 
support the University and MSU 
competed to fundraise for the 
AA490 Challenge.

By Sunday, Team Michi-

gan raised $14,931, topping 
Team MSU’s $11,181. Added to 
$4,465.50 that came in from 
neutral donors, the face-off 
raised a total of $30,577.50 from

were 
either 

“terminated” or forced 
to resign in early October 
after a small party one 
month 
earlier, 
which 

involved 
the 
presence 

of alcohol, came to the 
attention of senior staff, 
the State News reported 
Tuesday.

The 
State

detailed the accounts of 
two RAs in particular who 
said the grounds for their 
termination were not fair 
under 
RA 
governance 

laws. Both sources chose 
to go by pseudonyms.

One, referred to as 

“Sandra,” said measures 
to remove the RAs were 
carried out, despite the 
fact that no residents were 
involved in the party.

“The 
(investigative) 

process took about a week 
and I was cornered into 
talking about the situation, 
where 
I 
eventually 

incriminated myself and 
said 
that 
I 
consumed 

alcohol,” she said.

Dining directors, 

students 

By RIYAH BASHA

For the Daily

About five hours before Michi-

gan and Michigan State University 
faced off at the Big House on Sat-
urday, another kind of competition 
was brewing on the lawn of the 
Michigan Union.

Michigan Dining and the Cen-

ter for Campus Involvement host-
ed a three-round cooking contest 
between the two rivals Saturday 

morning, styled after the television 
show Iron Chef, featuring both 
students and the executive chefs 
from each school.

The event, which ultimately saw 

the University fall to MSU 311-303 
points, drew about 30 people.

“We’ve got this pairing between 

Michigan and Michigan State for a 
while,” said University Executive 
Chef Frank Turchan, who coordi-
nated the event. “Both teams have 
been looking for a venue like this 
for a while … They battle on the 
field, we battle in the kitchen.”

Slurping Turtle owner Takashi 

Yagihashi; Becky Schilling, edi-
tor in chief of Food Management 
magazine; and two student rep-
resentatives from the Univer-
sity’s Residence Halls Association 
judged the event.

LSA seniors Ashley Muehleise 

and Taylor Wood, who took on a 
breakfast sandwich challenge in 
the first round, represented the 
University as student chefs.

“We managed to get all the 

food on the plate with 90 seconds 
to spare,” Muehleise said after the 
round.

Wood said their strategy was to 

focus on planning ahead for each 
step of the cooking process, and 
emphasize good presentation.

The second round was a battle 

between each school’s executive 
chefs to see who could create the 
best ramen.

As the round progressed, light-

hearted trash talk ping-ponged 
back and forth between the chefs, 
with Turchan asking MSU Cor-
porate Chef Kurt Kwaiatkowski 
if he needed any help as the “little 
brother.”

Kwiatkowski responded by get-

ting MSU fans in attendance to 
chant “Go green, go white!” at his 
competitor.

Turchan said after the round 

that maintaining the rivalry was 
fun, but also noted the welcoming 
atmosphere during the event.

“It’s such a great rivalry, but I 

got to say that everyone here has 
received us with open arms, and 
it’s such a great experience,.” he 
said. “I’m glad that we could throw 
it all together.”

The third and final round 

asked the executive chefs and 
a selected team of their staff to 
create a signature dish from the 
competing schools while use an 
ingredient from the event’s spon-
sor, the National Pork Board — a 
pork pectoral muscle.

Though the University lost, 

Turchan said the event overall was 
a success. Both chefs walked away 
with plans to continue the compe-
tition.

“We are planning to make this 

a tradition,” Turchan said. “The 
food has brought a lot of us togeth-
er. I learned a lot more about the 
University — I mean, the sign shop 
helped us build the trophy, a lot of 
people from different departments 
wanted to support us. There’s a lot 
(of) synergies going on here.”

LSA sophomore Sydney Ohl, 

who attended the cookoff, said she 
enjoyed the event.

“Both teams look like they’re 

having tons of fun, and making 
great food in the process,” she said.

vacy. Even so, the synthetic data 
was based on real patterns from 
150 of the most popular cours-
es at the University. The data 
included information regarding 
high school performance, current 
course performance and gender.

Each team took a different 

approach to the data. Team Col-
lab estimated where correlations 
might occur within the data sets. 
Information senior Meera Desai 
said one factor they focused on 
was GPA.

“We are trying to understand 

how GPA, courses and faculty 
members correlate, and if you 
can understand and predict GPA 
based on certain variables and 
factors,” Desai said.

Team Bunker took a different 

approach. They sought correla-
tions by performing a series of 
statistical tests for the class data 

from Physics 140 and Physics 240. 
LSA senior Alexander Verros said 
certain variables became insig-
nificant when analyzed together.

“When you start adding inter-

actions, the first thing that 
becomes insignificant is high 
school GPA,” Verros said. “But 
the most insignificant thing was 
actually the interaction between 
college GPA, major and sex.”

At the end of the event, both 

teams presented their findings 
and outlined how they would pro-
ceed with their work if they had 
more time.

McKay, the founder of the 

hackathon, discussed the uses of 
the students’ ideas for academics 
at the University.

“A lot of people talk about 

this as grade prediction, which 
is scary and negative in a lot of 
ways, so I try to speak about this 
as learning from experience,” 
McKay said. “If we know you 
are headed for trouble we should 
treat it as something to act on, not 

as what’s going to happen.”

Kris Steinhoff, lead developer 

at DIG, said he was interested by 
the students’ unique take on proj-
ects already in the works.

“From the comments that I’ve 

overheard, they’ve been propos-
ing a number of ideas that we’ve 
been 
discussing 
separately,” 

Steinhoff said. “It’s really inter-
esting to see that they’re coming 
up with some of the same ideas 
that we’ve had, but it’s also inter-
esting to see their unique take on 
those problems.”

McKay said he constantly finds 

that students rise to the occasion 
when presented with a challenge.

“Every time I give students the 

chance to just contribute, they do 
that in a way that amazes me,” 
he said. “I used to think that I 
had to shape the student experi-
ence more, but the more I provide 
students with the open spaces to 
contribute, the more successful 
they seem.”

Ann Arbor considers 
options for regulating 

alcohol on pedal-
powered vehicles

By RIYAH BASHA

For the Daily

The city’s Liquor License Review 

Committee met Friday at City Hall 
to discuss, among other items of 
business, the legality of Trolley 
Pub Ann Arbor, the pedal-powered 
vehicle that began running city 
tours in September.

Trolley Pub’s business model 

encourages customers to bring their 
own drinks, but also makes inter-
mittent stops at bars and popular 
destinations downtown. Trolley 
Pub’s current operations are com-
pletely legal, following a law signed 
by Gov. Rick Snyder (R) in July that 
permits consumption of beer and 
wine by individuals on pedal pubs. 
The city could, however, pass an 
ordinance to make the practice ille-
gal.

The meeting marked the first 

formal introduction of Trolley Pub’s 
managing partner, Amanda Swan, 
to the committee. Swan, a 26-year-
old Detroit resident, has already 
been in regular contact with the 
Ann Arbor Police Department to 
establish a positive working rela-
tionship.

“I’d like to take responsibility 

to initiate contact and be on good 
terms with the city,” she said during 
the meeting.

As a driver present on all tours, 

Swan helps steer and direct the 

14-person bike, and monitors 
drinking 
passengers. 
Patrons 

must sign waivers in advance, 
are carded upon boarding and 
are not allowed to bring any hard 
liquor or glass bottles on board.

The committee, composed of 

three voting members, weighed 
two main options: regulating 
drinks or an outright ban on 
serving alcohol. City Council-
member Sumi Kailasapathy (D–
Ward 1) expressed concern about 
allowing Trolley Pub to continue 
operation unchecked.

“This is a real serious issue for 

me, people drinking and on the 
streets,” Kailasapathy said. “Our 
police force is already so stretched. 
I don’t give lip service to the people 
who protect us.”

AAPD Lieutenant Renee Bush 

acknowledged the potential diffi-
culty in dealing with unruly pas-
sengers on the streets, as Trolley 
Pub has the authority to remove 
riders at the driver’s discretion. 
Because the company is the first 
of its kind in Ann Arbor, Bush 
and Swan have had to work close-
ly together to analyze pedestrian 
patterns and traffic.

“(Swan) has been very amenable 

to my suggestions, and I appreci-
ate (her) willingness to reach out,” 
Bush said. “These are uncharted 
waters we are on.”

Trolley Pub operates in five other 

cities across the country, including 
campus towns such as Madison, 
Wis., and Raleigh, N.C. In drafting 
an ordinance, the committee will 
not only look to other cities’ poli-
cies, but also consider the opinions 
of major stakeholders, such as busi-

ness associations, city public servic-
es and safety administration, and 
the University.

Mary Fales, senior assistant city 

attorney, shared preliminary com-
ments from some of the entities.

“The Main Street Association is 

generally favorable to regulation 
… and the University wasn’t par-
ticularly interested in having opera-
tion of commercial quadricycles on 
‘University streets,’ ” Fales said.

Swan agreed it would be wise to 

avoid University traffic, especially 
on game days, and does not take the 
trolley into the vicinity of congested 
pedestrian areas such as near State 
Street or the Michigan Stadium. 
Even if the review committee votes 
to ban alcohol from the pedal pubs 
all together, Trolley Pub would still 
run tours.

“It’s not as profitable, but the 

model works without alcohol,” 
Swan said.

Committee Chair Jane Lumm 

(I–Ward 2) stressed that it would 
take time to finalize an ordinance, 
as the next meeting is scheduled 
for sometime in November. In the 
meantime, Trolley Pub and the city 
will work together to map approved 
routes and institute safety practices.

“There’s so many unknowns and 

public safety for everyone is criti-
cal,” Lumm said. “We’re trying to 
do this thoughtfully and purpose-
fully.”

Despite concerns, Swan said she 

is dedicated to promoting the ser-
vice in the city.

“My personal goal is to integrate 

Trolley Pub into Ann Arbor,” Swan 
said. “I’m willing to work with 
whoever and whenever.”

Liquor license committee 
talks plans for pub trollies

to repurpose the land for 
other projects. This has 
prompted concern from his-
torical preservation groups 
that the house might be 
destroyed in the process.

Though 
the 
council 

agreed to investigate, sev-
eral members were unsure 
whether 
Liberty 
Plaza 

would be a feasible location.

Councilmember Stephen 

Kunselman 
(D–Ward 
3) 

noted that it may be difficult 
to justify removing the only 
park located downtown for a 
historical building.

“The idea of moving a 

house to our park — the only 
park that we have in down-
town Ann Arbor — as a way 
of addressing issues that 
we have there seems far-
fetched,” he said. “You’re 
going to be talking to a lot of 
people who are not going to 
be that happy about giving 
up their park just to put up 
a house.”

Conditional zoning 

agreement

Council also discussed a 

conditional zoning agree-
ment 
that 
would 
allow 

developmental 
company 

Toll Brothers to build new 
470 new residences on the 
city’s north side.

Both members of the pub-

lic and council members 
raised several issues with 
the plan, citing, in particu-
lar, lack of detail on how 
it would impact the city in 
regard to traffic and preser-
vation of wetlands and other 
nature elements in the area. 
 
 

Ann Arbor resident Kami 

Meader said the plan was 
rushed.

“There are too many 

unanswered questions and 
problems with this con-

ditional zoning,” she said. 
“They’re just voting for it 
because they’re afraid they 
are going to lose the land to 
the University of Michigan 
and then they won’t get the 
tax payer dollars.”

Because the University 

is public, all of the land it 
owns is tax exempt. As the 
University buys up land, the 
purchases cut into the city’s 
tax revenues, which has 
prompted concerns from 
the city.

Kailasapathy raised con-

cerns regarding the plan’s 
lack of detail, specifically 
citing the acreage allocated 
for parklands, how the city 
will be paid, and a traffic 
mitigation agreement.

“How could we vote on 

this when it is not linked to 
some other document?” she 
said. “We need to know the 
ramifications of this.”

In response to the con-

cerns, 
Kevin 
McDonald, 

senior assistant city attor-
ney, said many of the issues 
cited with the conditional 
zoning agreement could be 
addressed in the site plan.

Despite the concerns, the 

council approved the condi-
tional zoning agreement 6 
to 4.

Councilmember 
Sabra 

Briere (D–Ward 2) noted 
the benefits of securing 
this agreement now, as it 
prevents the development 
company from making any 
significant changes moving 
forward without the coun-
cil’s approval.

“This locks the developer 

into producing exactly the 
site plan we approve,” she 
said. “If he fails to do that, 
the zoning falls through, 
and no other developer can 
build on that land unless 
they’re doing exactly the 
same thing within a certain 
amount of time.”

more than 380 donors, sur-
passing the campaign’s goal 
of $20,000.

Rape kits consist of mate-

rials — including small plas-
tic bags and microscopes 
— that can be used to collect 
forensic evidence of rape, 
such as clothing fibers, hair 
or body fluids. Legally, the 
kits can be used to identify 
those responsible for rape 
or exonerate the wrong-
fully accused. However, the 
rape kits have to be tested 
— or sent to a lab for foren-
sic analysis — to be useful 
in court. It is estimated 
that more than 70,000 rape 
kits remain untested in the 
United States. According 
to USA TODAY, one rea-
son rape kits may remain 
untested is because of the 
expensive cost for police to 
send the kits out for analy-
sis.

In 2009, 11,341 untest-

ed rape kits were found 
in a police storage facil-
ity in Wayne County. The 
kits were collected when 
the crimes were reported, 
but 
never 
analyzed. 
In 

response, Enough Sexual 
Assault in Detroit — a col-
laboration among Michi-
gan Women’s Foundation, 
the Wayne County Pros-
ecutor’s Office and the 
Detroit Crime Commission 
— formed to raise money to 
test the kits and investigate 
the crimes associated with 
them. In early September, 
Wayne County Prosecutor 
Kym Worthy, who founded 
Enough SAID, announced 
10,000 of these kits had 
been tested, with 1,341 
remaining untested. The 
effort resulted in 21 convic-
tions, 106 active cases and 
1,350 cases to be investi-
gated. 

Enough SAID launched 

the 
AA490 
Challenge 

in early October as an 
18-month-long project to 
raise money for the 1,341 
untested rape kits. The ini-
tiative was named for the 
$490 the campaign says it 

costs to test each kit. The 
campaign’s goal is to raise 
at least $657,090 — the 
minimum amount of money 
needed to test every kit. 
More money will be nec-
essary to investigate the 
crimes and prosecute the 
suspects associated with 
the results.

Worthy, 
a 
University 

alum, represented Team 
Michigan. MSU alum and 
co-host of the ESPN show 
“His & Hers” Jemele Hill 
represented Team MSU. 
Other 
people 
on 
Team 

Michigan included Univer-
sity Regents Shauna Ryder 
Diggs (D–Grosse Pointe)

University 
of 
Michigan 

Black Alumni president and 
Darci 
McConnell, 
presi-

dent and CEO of McConnell 
Communications, Inc.

McConnell 
said 
the 

donation face-off was a suc-
cess.

“The short version is 

that (it) has been very suc-
cessful,” McConnell said. 
“We’ve raised $15,000 from 
just the rivalry alone.”

In an interview with the 

Detroit Free Press, Wor-
thy said the real winners of 
this face-off are the women 
whose rape kits will be test-
ed.

“While it always feels 

good to trump MSU, it 
really is great that both 
schools could come togeth-
er because the real win-
ners will be those who get 
justice as a result of this 
effort,” Worthy said.

Peg Tallet, chief com-

munity engagement officer 
for the Michigan Women’s 
Foundation, said the cam-
paign could also shine light 
on sexual assault and rape 
on college campuses spe-
cifically.

“Enormous amount of 

rape occurs on or around 
college campuses,” Tallet 
said. “We hope that there 
will be a light shined on this 
issue and there will be an 
opportunity to educate and 
change attitudes on college 
campuses.”

T

ucked away in some of my favorite 
in-between-class 
hideaways, 
I 

recently devoted spare moments of 

my time to reading “To 
Kill 
a 
Mockingbird.” 

Each time I began to 
thumb through its pages, 
the sight of me reading 
this 
particular 
novel 

seemed to spark multiple 
renditions of the same 
conversation. Roommates, 
friends, 
classmates 
and 

coworkers 
— 
usually 

sporting 
a 
perplexed 
 

look — approached me 
asking some variation of 
the question: “Haven’t you 
read this before?” Most tended to be satisfied 
(and some relieved) when I informed them that 
I was, in fact, re-reading it for a class.

Considering 
the 
book’s 
prominent, 

solidified position among the litany of texts 
students often read as a part of their high 
school or middle school curriculum, I can 
understand why some might find it odd if 
I was reading it for the first time. However, 
as my professor suggested, as continually 
evolving individuals, we experience aspects 
of a novel differently as time progresses and 
views shift. There’s merit in re-examining a 
world you originally believed you saw in its 
entirety. Yes, the same characters may be 
acting within the same plot, but just as it is 
with the world, one glance doesn’t tell the 
whole story.

To 
fully 
understand 

a book, a situation, an 
issue or even a person, 
you 
can’t 
rely 
solely 

upon your initial vantage 
point. A second, third or 
fourth look is necessary 
to 
uncover 
what 
you 

may 
have 
overlooked 

before, 
underscoring 

the notion that learning 
is a continuous process 
and, 
no 
matter 
how 

much one may think they understand or see, 
there’s probably something missing from 
 

the conversation.

“To Kill a Mockingbird” is known for its 

discussions of racism, injustice, prejudice and 
empathy, and for capturing the atmosphere 
of an entire period of U.S. history. This isn’t 
what my class focused on. Instead, we talked 
about visibility. Our conversation centered on 
the interplay between who’s seen, who isn’t, 
who deserves to be visible and why they are 
or aren’t.

Sight 
and 
its 
accompanying 
array 

of dimensions and dynamics foster a 
prioritization of ideas and people. Visibility 
is arguably often a determinant of worth 
 

— what’s worth devoting attention to and 
what ideas stimulate action, receive support 
or are even publicly rejected. Who or 
what is seen in our media landscape, or in 
government, is a reflection of the balance of 
power and control in society as a whole.

Recently, Elle UK released a video 

online that plays with these dynamics of 
visibility. The simple exercise in Photoshop 

illustrates that what you don’t see is often 
more important than what you do. The video 
showcases photographic stills of governing 
bodies, producers, creators and other groups, 
and then it alters the image by removing all 
of the men within the picture to reveal a 
sparse scattering of women surrounded by 
multitudes of empty space.

The short video certainly succeeds in 

highlighting discrepancies with regard to 
gender representation. On one hand, one look 
at the unaltered images tells a viewer that 
female representation is present in a number 
of environments. However, when one looks 
again from a different perspective, vast empty 
spaces that a male majority usually occupies 
overpower this now-seemingly miniscule 
population of women.

While 
women 
are 
visible, 
the 

disproportionate representation of men leads 
to a problematic scenario in which a few 
outnumbered individuals are responsible for 
standing for their entire group. This scenario 
can be seen across numerous groups and 
communities. In the media landscape, the 
inclusion of diverse representation often 
results in another problematic scenario in 
which the select number of visible individuals 
in a group often falls within stereotypes that 
aren’t reflective of the group at all.

Visibility is a complicated issue with a 

variety of consequences. While making 
one’s 
presence 
known 
allows 
for 
the 

acknowledgement of their accomplishments, 
ideas and opinions, it likewise creates a space 
where one is like an ant thrust beneath the 

gaze 
of 
a 
magnifying 

glass.

Being noticed in the 

public 
eye 
creates 
an 

atmosphere of exposure 
that can invite scrutiny 
and 
make 
individuals 

susceptible to criticism. 

Yet 
without 
this 

recognition, 
unequal 

representation, 
in 
a 

multitude 
of 
areas, 

will continue to silence 

voices that have been neglected for far too 
long. Our perceptions of who “normally” 
is seen and heard within the public sphere 
inhibits 
debates 
and 
discussions. 
The 

underrepresented never even have the chance 
to exist. Even when representation exists and 
there’s a space for these discussions, a lack of 
diversity may lead to an absence of underlying 
conversations and issues.

Simply altering or slightly modifying the 

pictures of society that we see isn’t a sufficient 
method that we should accept when re-shaping 
society. Often in a book, the characters who 
truly force readers to consider viewpoints and 
ideas that deviate from the norm are those 
who are barely visible in the text. In fact, these 
characters are usually the ones readers don’t 
notice the first time through. If we truly want 
to address problematic issues and change 
society, we need to re-examine the larger 
narratives at play and increase the visibility of 
overlooked voices.

MELISSA
SCHOLKE

My interest in criminal justice 

policies has taken me to a few talks 
on the subject over the years. I’ve 
listened to people tell their stories 
of life behind bars and how those 
years have inspired them to seek 
change. All of these lectures have 
been informative and fascinating.

Last Tuesday, however, was the 

first time I’ve seen hordes of people 
wait hours outside an auditorium 
for the chance to hear an advocate 
for criminal justice reform speak. 
In fact, it was probably the only edu-
cational talk I have seen that filled 
a large auditorium so quickly and 
with such an enthusiastic crowd. 
But such is the power of Piper Ker-
man, the writer of the memoir that 
inspired the hit TV show “Orange is 
the New Black.”

Kerman is a vocal prison reform 

activist who uses her experience 
behind bars, through the TV show 
and her memoir that depict it, to 
shine a light on the fundamental 
flaws of our nation’s criminal jus-
tice system. She’s also undoubt-
edly a celebrity; the show (loosely) 
based on Kerman’s life experience 
is a massive hit, and she has 112,000 
followers on Twitter. It’s hard for 
me to reconcile these two identities, 
especially given that Kerman was 
not the typical U.S. prisoner, and 
her experience as a prisoner doesn’t 
reflect the pain and suffering felt by 
many of those incarcerated.

Mass incarceration, after all, is 

a problem that disproportionately 
affects communities of color and 
poor communities. Kerman, on 
the other hand, is white, wealthy 
and college-educated. People like 
Kerman (and me) are less likely 
to end up in jail or prison because 
our privilege makes us unlikely to 
be caught committing a crime and, 
if we are caught, less likely to be 
punished for it.

When rich white people commit 

crimes, it’s often viewed as a fool-

ish mistake or some kind of fluke. 
The same cannot be said for people 
of other backgrounds. And, if the 
wealthy do end up being charged, 
they can afford effective repre-
sentation. Kerman’s sentence was 
short because she could afford an 
attorney who could fight to get her 
the minimum sentence. Few people 
who end up in prison are that lucky, 
and her view of the prison system is 
undeniably a privileged one.

But the story of a white woman 

from a good family who ends up in 
prison is a story that people will 
listen to. In her interview with The 
Michigan Daily, Kerman acknowl-
edged that the reason people are 
interested in her story is because it’s 
a “fish-out-of-water story.” Every-
body knows that people like Ker-
man don’t go to jail. So, when they 
do, we’re interested. Her whiteness 
and wealth may make her ill-suited 
to be the face for prison reform, but 
these are the reasons that people 
are listening in the first place.

Kerman is well aware of her 

privilege, and uses it as a tool. She 
says she wrote “Orange is the New 
Black: My Year in a Women’s Pris-
on” so that somebody who usually 
wouldn’t pick up a book about pris-
on would be curious and find them-
selves empathizing with prisoners 
and caring about criminal justice 
reform. It did just that.

The popularity of “Orange is the 

New Black,” the book and show, 
brought 
complex, 
sympathetic 

prisoners of different races and 
backgrounds into the hearts of 
millions of Americans. The show 
is groundbreaking because it por-
trays prisoners as humans who 
made mistakes, not evil, danger-
ous people. The show continues to 
reveal the depth of humanity that 
these prisoners are capable of, and 
Kerman continues to advocate for 
prison justice reform. And people 
will keep watching and listening.

Even if it’s hard to stomach that 

a wealthy, white woman is prob-
ably the most famous prison reform 
advocate in the United States, it’s 
hard to deny that her activism has 
helped prison reform make huge 
strides. Kerman’s somewhat con-
flicting roles of celebrity and activ-
ist have helped the issue reach new 
ears. Her show is part of the reason 
that the topic is widely understood 
as a pressing national issue.

So maybe it’s best not to look a 

gift horse in the mouth.

As someone who cares a lot about 

changing the criminal justice sys-
tem, I will continue to be grateful 
for the work that Kerman does. But 
perhaps it’s time to bring additional 
voices to the forefront.

Kerman does her part by high-

lighting the stories of other former 
prisoners who are more representa-
tive of our nation’s prison popula-
tion. Now it’s our turn to make sure 
the conversation doesn’t end here.

Listen to the voices of other people 

who have experienced the crimi-
nal justice system, not just because 
their stories are interesting, but also 
because they are important. Listen to 
a TEDxUofM Talk by Mary Heinen 
and support the Prison Arts Coali-
tion, the project she co-founded that 
supports and provides resources for 
those creating art in and around the 
prison system. Be a part of the Prison 
Creative Arts Project, a similar pro-
gram that is housed in the Universi-
ty’s Residential College. Do your own 
research to find out how you can best 
help prisoners or reform prisons.

Don’t be content to take “Orange 

is the New Black” at face value: 
The plotlines on the show may be 
fictional, but the pain felt by the 
characters as a result of their incar-
ceration is far from make-believe.

MARY KATE WINN | VIEWPOINT

“I 

think I have seen your 
article in the Daily. You 
write for Michigan in 

Color right?”

I have heard 

this 
comment 

too many times 
for it to be a 
coincidence. 
As 

I calmly explain 
that I was not 
hired to write 
for Michigan in 
Color — which is 
a section of the 
Daily devoted to 
people of color 
— and that instead I’m an opinion 
columnist, I wonder what would 
lead so many people to the same 
conclusion. It may be because I write 
about my religious and cultural 
backgrounds, but to think that the 
subject matter of my articles would 
take people to that conclusion so 
often is still off-putting to me.

Maybe it’s the mere fact that I’m 

a person of color and a writer, and 
they saw my writing in the Opinion 
section.

Please do not misunderstand me. 

I respect MiC and highly encourage 
people to submit articles to the 
section. It’s a great space for people 
to write about their backgrounds 
and genuine experiences within 
their 
ethnicities 
and 
cultural 

backgrounds 
— 
I 
have 
even 

considered contributing to it before.

However, what I do not like is 

the idea that MiC is the only place 
that people of color are expected 
to talk about their backgrounds, 
or that people of color at The 
Michigan Daily seem confined to 
writing only for MiC. Discussion 
of culture shouldn’t be limited to 
one section of the paper, nor is it in 
actuality. People write about their 
backgrounds in other sections of 
the paper, and when I do the same, 
it’s because it’s my preference.

When 
one 
expresses 
their 

religion in a way that’s as visible 
as a hijab, it “colors” everything 
that person does. Any time I 
speak, I unwillingly become the 

spokesperson for all 1.57 billion 
Muslims. Any time my column 
shows up in the Daily, or someone 
adds me on social media, before 
they hit that follow button, the first 
thing they see is my hijab.

In most ways, I love my hijab, 

what it represents to me and the 
satisfaction of getting through 
to someone who had negative 
misconceptions about it previously. 
At the same time, it can get tiring 
being the “token Muslim girl” in 
class discussions, or even in the 
Daily’s Opinion section. The weight 
of it can be overwhelming, but it 
proves more flaws on society’s part 
than my own. 

Imagine what this might feel like 

for a moment. Chances are that you 
can relate to that feeling in some way 
— being discredited just because of 
your appearance. Yes, I’m a Muslim. 
Yes, I often write about my culture 
and 
my 
background, 
breaking 

misconceptions surrounding them 
because it’s important to me. No, 
I do not see that as an excuse for 
you to confine me to the ideas that 
you have about 
Muslims 
or 

people of color in 
general.

When 
you 

are 
the 
token 

Muslim girl you 
also become the 
token “Arab girl” 
even if, as in 
my case, you’re 
not 
Arab. 
My 

roots in India go back about three 
generations, but even before that 
generation, I’m still Persian before 
reaching my Arab roots.

Ethnicity and culture are not just 

skin deep. To begin understanding 
the 
complexity 
of 
ethnicity 

and culture is important when 
approaching people of different 
backgrounds 
than 
one’s 
own. 

Truthfully, unless you can trace 
your ancestors to the very home you 
live in right now, the chances are 
that your roots begin somewhere 
else. This is important to think 
about before painting somebody 

else with a large brush just for what 
they look like on the surface.

Sometimes when I do not fit the 

label people already precomputed 
for me, they stare at me in awe: “No, 
you cannot be Indian!”

If I say I’m not Middle Eastern, 

people often argue, “Pakistan is 
considered part of the Middle East 
to some people” (which is false, 
unless you want to consider the 
Indian subcontinent a part of the 
Middle East).

Though it isn’t plausible for you to 

know the roots of every person that 
you meet before inquiring about their 
culture, it’s critically important to be 
respectfully unassuming. Listen to 
people with an open mind, and if they 
tell you what their background is, 
believe them — don’t question them 
with skepticism.

I have been told to write less 

about my background. I have 
been asked why I feel the need 
to self-victimize. Time and time 
again, people have written off my 
accomplishments after one look 
at me, but I’m empowered just 

the same, and 
continue 
to 

hope that my 
writing inspires 
people 
in 
a 

multitude 
of 

ways.

Explaining 

that 
just 

because 
I 

write about my 
religion 
and 

ethnicity does not mean that I write 
for MiC is just another hurdle to get 
through as I try to reach people 
through writing quality columns 
spanning a variety of subjects.

True, this might be another 

column

‘Mommy’ scares 
with disturbance

Messed-up Austrian 

horror film will 
bend your mind 

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

Like most modern horror films, 

the new Austrian film “Goodnight 
Mommy” aims 
more to be dis-
turbing 
than 

genuinely scary. 
After some early 
atmospheric 
thrills, the film 
turns to blood, 
gore and body 
horror. 
Still, 

“Goodnight 
Mommy” offers conclusive proof 
that horror built on mind-bending 
twists and sheer fucked-upedness 
can be just as effective as horror 
built on sustained terror.

After an unspecified accident 

that left her badly hurt, a nameless 
mother (Susanne Wuest, “Antar-
es”) undergoes a serious operation, 
leaving her face wrapped in ban-
dages. After finding mysterious 
photographs and observing their 
mother’s strangely cold behavior, 
identical twins Elias and Lukas 
(newcomers 
Elias 
and 
Lukas 

Schwarz) begin to suspect that the 
woman in their house is an entirely 
different person from their moth-
er. Over the course of the film, the 
twins make it their mission to fig-
ure out this new woman’s identity 
and locate their real mom.

The first half of “Goodnight 

Mommy” follows a familiar pat-
tern in horror. It’s a normal day 
until strange things start popping 
up. Gradually the events become 
odder and more sinister until they 
climax in bloodshed and insanity. 
Elias and Lukas’s mother imposes 
strict bedtime rules, completely 
lacking the warmth they remem-
ber, and in one scene featuring a 
game like 20 Questions, she fails 
to guess that the person they’re 
describing is herself. By the time 
half of the film has passed, Elias 

and Lukas are determined to find 
their real mother.

If the first half seems predict-

able, its slow pace is easily made 
tolerable by a few key details. Writ-
er-directors Veronika Franz (“Dog 
Days”) and Severin Fiala (“Kern”) 
are fantastic at creating atmo-
sphere; the film’s secluded setting 
in a house far from town is almost 
always framed in broad daylight, 
which somehow seems even more 
threatening than in darkness. The 
trees shake softly in the wind, the 
pond’s surface gently rippling, and 
Olga Neuwirth’s score is kept to a 
minimum to disquieting effect.

Another big strength of the slow 

build-up is the dynamic between 
Elias and Lukas. As the protago-
nists, the Schwarz twins convey a 
deep bond with few words. What’s 
most refreshing about their fear 
of their mother’s impostor is how 
naturally and understatedly it 
develops. There’s no artificial 
revelatory moment when the char-
acters find one final piece of proof 
that the woman isn’t their mother. 
They begin to accept it slowly and 
without melodrama. When one 
twin lies crying on the bed, the 
other tenderly lays a hand on his 
side. Before long, the twins are 
calmly preparing for battle, sharp-
ening sticks as makeshift weapons 
and sleeping in shifts. Elias and 
Lukas are fascinating in their silent 
drawing of conclusions, unusual in 

a genre filled with brash, ignorant 
protagonists unequipped to dis-
cover the obvious truth.

After 
the 
halfway 
point, 

though, 
“Goodnight 
Mommy” 

dives into insanity, bombarding 
viewers with unsettling images 
and incredulous revelations. The 
shock of some twists will depend 
entirely on viewers’ prior experi-
ence searching for twist endings. 
In retrospect, some are foreshad-
owed to the point of obviousness, 
but thanks to the film’s dedication 
to misdirection, it’s easy to ignore 
the signs pointing there.

Though 
third-act 
realiza-

tions answer some questions, 
and though the film leaves its 
characters’ fates clear, there are 
threads throughout the story 
that remain unexplained and 
ambiguous. Many of these can be 
explained psychologically with-
out any strict logistical sense, 
but some red herrings don’t quite 
fit with the truth in any appar-
ent way. References to the past 
are kept vague, like the nature 
of the mother’s accident. The 
film’s understated quality may 
be both its greatest strength and 
its greatest flaw; though highly 
retentive viewers looking for clo-
sure may crave handy flashbacks 
explaining the entire backstory, 
“Goodnight Mommy” is ulti-
mately a better movie because it 
refuses to spell everything out.

He’s from the rough side of ‘Where the Wild Things Are.’

‘Jane the Virgin’ still 
a crowd-pleasing hit

TV REVIEW

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

“Jane the Virgin,” one of the 

most exciting new shows of last 
year, has finally returned as hilari-
ous, fun and poi-
gnant as ever. 
After a 22-epi-
sode first sea-
son that ate up 
plot at a frantic 
pace, it was hard 
not to wonder if 
the show would 
come back and 
struggle to find 
a new story to 
tell. Judging by 
this 
premiere, 

though, “Jane” 
is as fast-paced as ever, still main-
taining its big laughs and big emo-
tional beats.

Where we last left off, Jane Vil-

laneuva (Gina Rodriguez, “Filly 
Brown”) had just given birth to a 
son, who was promptly kidnapped 
by an employee of criminal mas-
termind Sin Rostro. “Chapter 23,” 
the second season premiere, fol-
lows Jane and her two love inter-
ests, ex-fiancé Michael (Brett 
Dier, “Ravenswood”) and baby-
daddy Rafael (Justin Baldoni, 
“Everwood”), as they search for 
baby Mateo.

It would be difficult to maintain 

the show’s sense of fun if Jane’s son 
remained missing for long, so it’s a 
bit of a relief to have Mateo back 
in his mother’s arms after roughly 
10 minutes of the premiere. Luck-
ily, that particular story, like every 
other story on “Jane the Virgin,” is 
told efficiently and quickly, and its 
conclusion only means the show 
has more time to explore other 

plots. After Jane’s father, telenove-
la star Rogelio (Jaime Camil, “The 
Poor, Rich Family”), tweets about 
Mateo’s kidnapping, paparazzi 
begin bombarding Jane outside 
her home. Meanwhile, Michael 
reluctantly gives Rafael advice that 
may bring him closer to Jane, and 
Rafael’s ex-wife, Petra (Yael Grob-
glas, “Reign”), plans to inseminate 
herself with Rafael’s one remain-
ing sperm sample. All of these 
subplots are as entertaining and 
funny as ever, and the Latin Love 
Narrator (still fantastically voiced 
by Anthony Mendez, Emmy-nom-
inated for Outstanding Narrator) 
helps keep them straight with his 
helpful and self-aware voiceover.

Still, amid all the soap opera 

drama with drunken Vegas wed-
dings and secret inseminations, 
the most poignant scenes are the 
ones focused on the understated 
drama of Jane’s role as a new moth-
er. Throughout the episode, Jane 
struggles with the seemingly halt-
ed production of her breastmilk, 
and worries that Mateo weighs 
too little. The heart of “Jane the 
Virgin,” more than theatrical mur-
der plots and passionate romance, 
has always been the relation-
ships among the three Villaneuva 
women, and it’s heartwarming to 
once again see Jane’s mother and 
grandmother, Xo (Andrea Nave-
do, “One Life to Live”) and Alba 
(Ivonne Coll, “Glee”), comfort her 
throughout her first week as a 
mother. Rodriguez invests Jane’s 
private domestic conflicts with 
such heart and feeling that when 
her milk does finally come out, it’s 
just as powerful and significant as 
a romantic embrace.

One of the best side effects 

of the show’s swift pace is that 

characters’ secrets don’t remain 
hidden for very long. In a lesser 
show, Xo and Rogelio would keep 
their Vegas wedding secret from 
Jane until the season finale, but 
in one of the few moments of 
downtime late in the episode, 
Xo admits the truth to Jane and 
Alba, who laugh it off and tease 
her. On a smaller scale, Rafa-
el readily admits to Jane that 
Michael was the one who gave 
him fatherly advice, so Jane isn’t 
tempted to see Rafael with rose-
colored glasses.

Speaking of which, “Jane the 

Virgin” may have the best love 
triangle on TV. In a different ver-
sion of this same show, Michael 
might be the whiny, unfunny sec-
ond choice, bland compared to 
Rafael’s charismatic playboy per-
sona. Viewers are given reasons 
to love both Rafael and Michael, 
though. Michael may not have 
the sexual magnetism of Rafael 
(exemplified by Baldoni’s shirt-
less torso as he cradles Mateo 
near the end), but his chemistry 
with Jane is just as passionate, 
emphasized with playful jokes 
that show their genuine connec-
tion. Sure, Michael is the clear 
“nice guy” type, but he’s not the 
boring sap that phrase sometimes 
implies. Besides, some of the fun-
niest scenes depict the adorable 
bromance between Michael and 
Rogelio, one of the best character 
pairings in the show.

“Chapter 23” kicks off the sec-

ond season of “Jane the Virgin” 
by giving viewers what they want: 
countless 
laughs, 
ridiculously 

fast-moving plotlines and a sense 
of joy that characterizes few other 
shows on television. It’s going to 
be a great season.

M

y older sister Theresa got married two 
weeks ago, and my sister Michelle was 
the maid of honor. Theresa, the bride, 

was calm. Michelle was not.

For Michelle, the wedding 

was the culmination of 12 
months 
of 
planning. 
She 

had 
survived 
the 
Vegas 

bachelorette 
party. 
The 

flowers arrived in Milwaukee 
and were arranged just so. 

Two 
days 
before 
the 

wedding, she FaceTimed me. 
“The speech,” she cried. “I 
forgot about the speech.”

I led her through some 

breathing 
exercises 
I 

remembered from a video about giving birth. 
“In through the nose,” I said, ad-libbing. “Out … 
through the nose.”

Public speaking isn’t one of Michelle’s talents. She 

has enough of them. She’s a nurse at Northwestern 
Hospital in Chicago and much brighter than me or 
Theresa.

But Michelle also had a childhood speech 

impediment. It left her with an acute phobia of 
public speaking. She perfected her speech through 
years of speech therapy. That, and intensive 
bullying by me and my sister Theresa.

“Mithelle thells thea thells down by the thea 

thore,” we’d mock when she did her speech 
exercises.

I regret that now, but, you know, kids can be 

cruel, especially shitty kids like me and Theresa. 
You can bully children out of anything. Theresa 
and Michelle bullied me out of my Britney Spears 
phase. Michelle and I bullied Theresa out of calling 
mom “Mommy” when she was 14. It’s a natural part 
of the sibling ecosystem.

The difference was my mom never stepped in 

when Theresa and I got picked on. But if we mocked 
Michelle’s S sounds, my mom would explode. It was 
a guaranteed grounding at the least. “She never 
stands up for us,” we’d grumble on the way to our 
rooms. “It’s not our fault the girl can’t thpeak.”

We didn’t understand the trauma that comes 

with speech problems and why 
my mom was so protective. 
Theresa and I were 12 and 
eight, respectively. To us, it was 
blatant favoritism.

Soon 
Michelle’s 
speech 

problems became the nuclear 
bomb of West family fights. You 
could whip it out once every few 
years, and only if the situation 
was approaching critical mass.

I used it when Michelle 

and Theresa threw me into a bedpost. Only after 
I exhausted all other ammo: “Do you think you’re 
thtrong? How’s your thpeech class going, Mithelle?” 

This was years after Michelle perfected her 

speech, but she still beat the crap out of me. I thought 
my mom would chain me up in the basement until I 
was 30. “Do your wortht, woman!” I yelled, laughing 
manically as she dragged me to my room.

I didn’t use the nuclear insult again until I 

was 19, when I was a sophomore in college. It 
was December and I was visiting my sisters in 
Milwaukee. At the time, they both went to college 
at Marquette University, where my dad had gone. 
It’s sort of the family school. I grew up a Marquette 
basketball fan. It was a bit of a shock when I chose 
to go to Michigan, five hours away from home.

My parents were in town for a basketball 

game, so they took us to get dinner at a restaurant 
downtown. My sisters and my dad talked about 
the season so far — I’d stopped watching. I didn’t 
actually talk much through the meal.

Then we headed to the Old German Beer Hall, 

a Milwaukee stein-and-polka joint. It’s been a 
Marquette student favorite since my dad was in 
school in the ’70s. My sister’s friends showed up 
— my parents knew them pretty well. Again, the 
conversation strayed into things I knew nothing 
about. My family talked about Milwaukee bars, 
sports teams, etc. They referenced nights I’d 
missed, and they’d have to recount them for me, the 
Ann Arborite.

Since I had nothing to say, I had plenty of 

time to drink. I worked through a few boots 
of Hefeweizen. I watched the band play polka 

versions of classic rock songs.

I hinted to Michelle that I wanted to leave, since 

I was staying on her couch. She didn’t want to go, 
but we stumbled to the edge of campus through 
the snow, toward her apartment.

We passed a chili joint called Real Chili and she 

dragged me inside. Fifty students waited in line 
for a bowl. “It’s the best chili in Milwaukee,” she 
said. “Probably in the country. Dad used to come 
here when he was a student and play Risk in this 
booth for hours. Theresa and I get it every Friday.”

“I get this pizza called South U at Michigan. It’s 

probably the best pizza in the world,” I lied. “It got 
like, a bunch of awards. It’s real New York style — 
not anything you’d get in Milwaukee.”

She wasn’t paying attention. She pointed at my 

bowl of chili. “Here: you’ve gotta mix it up. No 
— you’re doing it wrong. All the beans are at the 
bottom. Dad says that’s the best part.”

“You don’t have to be thuch a bitch about it 

Mithelle,” I said. “It’s just thitty thtupid chili.” 

I slept on a bench outside her apartment that 

night. We had a screaming match over chili, of 
all things. You’re not better than this chili! was the 
central theme, and You can’t turn your back on the 
family chili, Tommy!

Michelle almost went to Michigan, too. She 

got in, a fact she never lets me forget. When she 
visited, she said no one looked happy. It was 
too competitive. Even the partying seemed 
competitive. So she chose Milwaukee, and the 
family chili.

Milwaukee is a poor city, barring a few 

lakeshore neighborhoods. Marquette University 
sits between downtown and the less-privileged 
neighborhoods. I shared a bench with two other 
homeless people.

But in an hour Michelle came down and picked 

me up off the bench. I was frozen, drunk and 
angry and grateful and trying not to be tearful 
around my sister. She supported me upstairs.

I told her that, in a lot of ways, she was right 

about Michigan. I wasn’t happy sophomore year. 
I missed feeling smart in high school. I missed 
feeling athletic. I missed having my best friends. I 
missed having fun that wasn’t just fucked up times. 

I missed my family. I didn’t like 
coming home and feeling like a 
stranger.

Two years after that night, 

I listened to Michelle nail the 
maid of honor speech. She told 
the story of Theresa and Dave’s 
engagement. It went like this: 
Dave was about to propose on 
the shore of Lake Michigan. 
Then another family came 
down and started spreading 

the ashes of a loved one. Dave panicked. He knelt 
down and proposed anyways, and my whole 
family (me included) cheered. We felt bad about 
the family spreading ashes, but it was one of the 
happiest moments our family has ever had. How 
could we not cheer?

Once the guests stopped laughing, Michelle tied 

the speech up with a comment about the circle of 
life. It was flawless. The room loved her comedic 
timing, her tear-jerking sincerity. They ate it out 
of her hands.

I hated it. As kids, we decided I would be the 

funny one, Theresa would be the cool one and 
Michelle could have the brains.

But Michelle’s grown out of that role. She can 

be smart and funny now. Maybe not cool, but give 
it a few years.

Around 3 a.m., after everyone was good and 

drunk, Theresa ordered three vats of real chili to 
the hotel. Me, my Dad, Michelle, Theresa and now 
Dave sat in the lobby and ate. We stayed up talking 
until Michelle’s head literally hit the table. She 
was exhausted from 12 months of planning and 
the greatest wedding speech of all time.

Dave has this absurd laugh — it sounds like a 

hyena getting shock therapy. When I first heard 
it, I pulled Theresa aside to ask if she knew her 
boyfriend was a serial killer. Michelle and I 
probably could have bullied it out of him, though. 
But we don’t really do that anymore. Because he’s 
our brother, and we love him.

6A — Wednesday, October 21, 2015

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I 

remember back in Decem-
ber when “The Interview” 
was released — all of the 

talk surrounding the contro-
versial depiction of North 
Korea and 
Kim Jong-
Un. But 
that didn’t 
bother me; 
I was more 
concerned 
about online 
streaming. 
Because of 
the threat 
of North 
Korean 
“retaliation,” many theaters 
refused to show the film, but 
YouTube, in an act of bravery, 
offered to stream the movie 
online so it could get a proper 
release. Though I was thankful 
YouTube — this binary Reagan 
— could lay waste to the Com-
munist regimes as in the days 
of old, I was worried.

Was 
this 
the 
future 
of 

cinema? Would people resort 
to online streaming for their 
movie 
going 
needs? 
Would 

there even be a reason to leave 
the house anymore? Would we 
all end up looking like those 
flabby, gelatonous humans that 
“Wall-E” so prophesized? 

My fears were unfounded: 

“The Interview” took a major 
hit at the box office, raking in 
less than a third of its budget 
(though 
Sony 
contends 
it 

recouped its losses through 
the online rentals), and cinema 
would go on to have one of its 
most lucrative summers ever in 
2015. I overreact sometimes.

But as of this last Friday, 

cinema 
faces 
a 
similar 

development: Netflix released 
its first feature length film, 
“Beasts of No Nation.” This 
film, unlike “The Interview” 
isn’t 
slapstick 
satire 
about 

daddy issues and poop jokes and 
general racism. This is a film 
with award season aspirations, 
and, based on early reviews, 
might actually get them. What’s 
interesting 
here 
is 
Netflix 

is streaming the film online 
and releasing it in theaters at 
a later date. And I am deeply 
curious what exactly happens 
here: will “Beasts” prove a box 
office dud? Will it garner the 
awards attention Netflix thinks 
it deserves? And how do you 
measure the success of a film 
that’s being distributed through 
an online service that most 
people already own?

These thoughts I had about 

the future of cinema started 
to come back. “Beasts of No 
Nation” isn’t B-movie popcorn 
trash/a Saturday night time-
killer like “The Interview.” 
The people who watch it aren’t 
looking 
for 
entertainment, 

they’re curious about what the 
movie has to say, they want to 
see what Cary Fukunaga can do 
as a director with a full length 
feature, they want to find the 
substance at the heart of the 
feature and they want to see 
Idris Elba continue to be one of 
the best working actors in the 
game.

“Beasts of No Nation” is a 

game changer — this is real 
cinema, coming to you in the 
comfort of your own home. I 
can’t say I approve.

Moviegoing is an experience, 

and is something that takes 
commitment. You have to want 
it because, when you think 
about it, moviegoing is kind 
of ridiculous — it is the act of 
deliberately going out of your 
way to pay to stare at a giant 
screen in a dark room, with the 
assumption that you will shut 
yourself off from all contact for 
a minimum of 90 but upwards 
of 325 minutes (for at least some 
films, like Lars Von Trier’s 
“Nymphomaniac”). 
Further, 

for nourishment, you will pay 
exorbitant prices for foodstuffs 
that lack any nutritional value. 
Should you need to relieve 
yourself, the screening that 
you have paid for will not stop 
for you; rather, every second 
spent outside of the theater is a 
second you are literally flushing 
down the toilet. And upon your 
return, when you inquire of 
your movie going brethren what 
transpired events you may have 
missed, you will be promptly 

hushed (by me, for example) for 
daring to speak over the sounds 
of film. In short, moviegoing 
requires unspoken rules that 
absolutely run counter to the 
freedoms one experiences when 
watching film at home.

But that’s the beauty of the 

thing. The movie is the be-all 
and end-all of the excursion: 
the 
darkness 
prevents 
you 

from seeing the few extraneous 
details of the theater; the 
chairs (especially if they’re the 
reclining ones many theaters 
are implementing) force you 
to look directly at a screen the 
size of a wall; there is no pause 
button; you will be publicly 
shamed 
when 
you 
decide 

Tinder is a better use of your 
time. There is, simply, nothing 
but the movie. It’s immersive — 
a full-on experience.

When you watch a movie 

at home, at least when it’s 
your first viewing of that 
movie, you’ve really missed an 
important element of its full 
force — something is lost on 
your television. And I get that 
sometimes you can’t make it to 
the theater, or you just didn’t 
care enough to go. But urgency 
or 
convenience 
shouldn’t 

outweigh 
the 
complete 

experience of movie going.

What I’m trying to say is 

this: don’t watch “Beasts of No 
Nation” on Netflix, wait for 
the theatrical release. Don’t 
give 
studios 
the 
idea 
that 

convenience is more important 
than the movie itself. Believe it 
or not, the consumer does have 
power in this business.

I 
understand 
that 

streaming new releases won’t 
singlehandedly kill the business, 
but it is symptomatic of a shift in 
what we as a movie-going culture 
care about. I get that accessibility 
and speed and “move or die” is 
what matters today. But they 
got something very right in 
1905 when the Nickelodeon 
opened in Pittsburgh, and it’s 
something 
worth 
preserving 

and continuing.

TV REVIEW
‘Fargo’ continues 
evil and violence

Characters lash out 

in Season Two of 

FX series

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

Violence is always bubbling 

under the surface in “Fargo.” 
Against the mundane existence 
of the Minne-
sota 
expanse, 

viciousness 
and 
criminal-

ity explode in 
gunfire 
and 

red blood that 
seeps into the 
snowy 
white-

ness. Driven by 
dissatisfaction 
and repression, 
characters lash 
out violently against their pres-
ent reality in an attempt to carve 
out their own chunk of the world, 
not caring about who’s hurt in 
the process.

These forceful attempts at con-

trolling one’s existence after end-
less humiliations are perversions 
of the tale of Job told by the Judge 
(Ann 
Cusack, 
“Nightcrawler”) 

to Rye Gerhardt (Kieran Culkin, 
“Scott Pilgrim vs. The World”) 
before the season premiere’s first 
explosion. Not everyone can take 
ceaseless indignities — in fact, 
most can’t. In the first season, 
Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman, 
“Sherlock”) struck out against his 
meek life after being exposed to 
the influence of Lorne Malvo (Billy 
Bob Thornton, “Sling Blade”).

This theme, initially manifested 

within Jerry Lundegaard (William 
H. Macy, “Shameless”) in the Coen 
Brothers’ 1996 film and continued 
with Lester in series form by writ-
er Noah Hawley (“Bones”), touch-
es on the trappings of everyday life 
and the primal drive to gain what 
people think is theirs. When Rye, 
the beaten down youngest son of 
the notoriously criminal Gerhardt 
clan, snaps and kills the Judge 
after she strongly rejects his busi-

ness proposition it is the continua-
tion, or predecessor, in a sustained 
cycle of malevolence.

Set in 1979, the second season of 

“Fargo” is a prequel to the anthol-
ogy’s first season that took place in 
2006. While the events of “Fargo” 
are terrifying, they aren’t isolated 
incidents. They’re parts of an end-
less sequence that’s been going on 
since before the tale of Job. Hawley 
controls these recurrent themes 
through continuously strong char-
acters and a setting that presents a 
blank canvas for the moral conflict 
that violently plays out. This excel-
lence in synthesizing themes into 
the narrative and character arcs 
makes “Fargo” one of the strongest 
series on television.

To combat the cycle of evil is 

a constant good that forms the 
emotional and narrative heart of 
“Fargo.” Defined by Lou Solver-
son (Patrick Wilson, “The Con-
juring”), the father of season one 
hero Molly (Allison Tolman, “The 
Gift”) now played by Raven Stew-
art (“Cracked”), this morality 
expresses itself in small moments. 
Moments like Lou reading Molly a 
bedtime story, father-in-law Hank 
Larsson’s (Ted Danson, “CSI”) 
personal knowledge of small-town 
citizens and the quiet moments 
of intimacy between Lou and his 
wife Betsy (Cristin Miloti, “How 
I Met Your Mother”) during their 
conversations are small but infi-
nitely sincere and meaningful. It’s 
this sense of community that keeps 
the side of good together, even in 
the face of powerful evils like the 
Gerhardts and the encroaching 
Kansas City mob.

Stuck in between these sides 

are the Blomquists, Peggy (Kirst-
en Dunst, “Melancholia”) and Ed 
(Jesse Plemons, “Breaking Bad”). 
The young couple displays both of 
the sensibilities that could draw 
them to either side of “Fargo” ’s 
eternal struggle. Ed’s a simple 
man, humorously introduced in a 
sequence that makes ample use of 
the phrase, “OK then.” He loves 
his wife and wants to support her 
through his job as a butcher. Peggy 
is more complicated, as a sense of 

dissatisfaction with her monoto-
nous life seems to pervade every 
moment of her existence. As evi-
denced by her plans to take part in 
self-improvement seminars and a 
stack of self-help books and maga-
zines, she wants more. While Ed 
wants to preserve this grounded 
existence, Peggy has ambitions 
beyond Ed’s dreams of having kids 
and owning the butcher shop, and 
it quietly tears her apart.

Hawley’s devotion to detailing 

his characters with the smallest of 
particulars crafts a cast of charac-
ters that organically fit within the 
isolated Minnesota environment. 
In this world, forces push and pull 
characters towards different sides 
of a moral compass. While these 
influences can appear in everyday 
conversation, a passing compli-
ment or derogatory insult, they can 
take the form of elements beyond 
explanation.

As a set of mysterious lights 

resembling a UFO leads Rye 
out into the road after his diner 
massacre, the driving force of 
the unknown comes into play. 
Peggy’s car slams into the young 
criminal; in this moment she is 
tested, choosing to drive off with 
Rye’s unconscious body still on 
the windshield. It’s a choice that 
will lead her and everyone in her 
immediate circle down a twisting 
path of tricky ethics.

Underneath the conceived sim-

plicity of everyday life, the labyrin-
thine underworld of “Fargo” plays 
out. “This thing’s only getting’ 
bigger,” Lou’s conspiracy-minded 
friend, Karl Weathers (Nick Offer-
man, “Parks and Recreation”) says 
in regards to the murders at the 
diner. With rival criminal organi-
zations preparing for war and per-
haps larger forces of good and evil 
at work, “Fargo” will only grow 
more complex as the simple moral-
ity of people like Lou will struggle 
against the complicated lawless 
element that rears its head. Yet, in 
the capable hands of Hawley and 
his team, “Fargo” continuously 
delivers storytelling excellence 
that remains unmatched by most 
of its competitors.

‘Kingdom’ a gritty 
knock-out drama

One-two punch of 
moving story and 
impressive acting

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

First impression quiz: there’s a 

show called “Kingdom” starring 
Disney-turned-“Jealous” 
pop-

star Nick Jonas. 
There’s 
fight-

ing 
involved, 

some 
fam-

ily drama and 
a lot of sweat 
and 
muscles 

popping 
out 

of v-necks. If 
you’re imagin-
ing an amped-
up version of 
“Camp 
Rock” 

with a “Fight Club” theme, I’m 
right there with you.

Thankfully, 
Audience 
Net-

work’s “Kingdom” is a far cry from 
guitar riffs and teenage angst, 
despite Jonas’s presence. There’s a 
different kind of angst at Navy St., 
a mixed martial arts gym in Venice 
Beach — a fighter’s angst, driven 
by a terrifying will to both kill and 
support others.

Ringleader Alvey Kulina (Frank 

Grillo, “Warrior”) owns and runs 
the gym, now expanded since sea-
son one, with the help of his preg-
nant sometimes-girlfriend and 
talented manager, Lise (Kiele San-
chez, “The Purge: Anarchy”), who 
happens to be the ex-fiance of one 
of their best fighters, an ex-convict 
named Ryan (Matt Luria, “Friday 
Night Lights”). Joining Ryan in 
the ring are Alvey’s two sons, Jay 
(Jonathan Tucker, “Texas Chain-
saw Massacre”) and Nate (Nick 
Jonas), who are fighting to win 
their father’s approval and sup-
port their troubled mother, Chris-
tina (Joanna Going, “The Tree of 
Life”), the estranged wife of Alvey 
who is haunted by a drug addiction 
and a past of prostitution.

While Christina works double 

shifts in a lifeless burger joint, 
her sons are paid to fight. Though 
the fighters’ job is destructive by 
definition, it steers them away — 
Jay especially — from even more 
dangerous hobbies, like drugs 

and crime. Their power in the 
ring and in society comes from 
their prestige, a solid record of 
wins over losses in strategically 
arranged matches. But their value 
falls when an opponent backs out 
of a fight, as Jay’s does in the sea-
son two premiere.

When the fight is cancelled, and 

with his pride hurt, Jay furiously 
turns to drinking and cocaine, 
waiving his responsibility to sup-
port his mother’s sobriety by the 
fact that she is working a double 
shift that day. During his drug-
fueled rampage, Jay reveals the 
reality of fighting and what it 
means to him, in Freudian terms. 
Essentially, fighting is an outlet 
for repressed emotions: feelings 
of worthlessness in society, anger 
at his parents and himself, anxiety 
that he isn’t the role model for Nate 
that he wants to be. Jay’s emotions 
are bottled up without this outlet, 
forcing him to abuse drugs and 
alcohol to distract himself. But if 
his fights continue to cancel, Jay’s 
binges will worsen — a risk not 
to only his physical and mental 

health, but to his job status and 
family relationships.

Jay’s dynamic character, as 

both a brutal fighter and ago-
nized son, parallels the show 
itself: where “Kingdom” could 
have strictly been a testosterone-
pumped show about fighting, 
it rounds itself out with deep 
emotions and vulnerability, giv-
ing the characters something to 
fight for and the audience a rea-
son to root for them.

Though the show is domi-

nated by men, set in the overly 
masculine world of physical 
fighting, the women of the show 
are 
equally 
as 
ferocious. 

Though she doesn’t fight her-
self, Lise has an eye for talent in 
the ring and will stop at nothing 
to get who and what she wants. 
Christina, in some ways Lise’s 
counterpart, revels in her inde-
pendence, though it often leads 
to dangerous choices. Joining 
them this season is Alicia Men-
dez (Natalie Martinez, “End of 
Watch”), a talented fighter who 
is recruited by Lise, giving a 
breath of badass girl power to 
the fight ring.

“Kingdom” came into the 

TV ring as an underdog. In the 
midst of family sitcoms and 
high-drama crime powerhous-
es, a small-network show about 
underground fighting that stars 
a teenage heartthrob is ques-
tionable at best. But with a one-
two punch of moving drama and 
impressive acting, “Kingdom” 
might just be a knockout.

‘Lucky Stars’ a bad follow-up

By REGAN DETWILER

Daily Arts Writer

Just two months after their 

August 
release 
of 
Depression 

Cherry, the indie-dream-pop duo 
Beach 
House 

announced Oct. 
7 
the 
release 

of Thank Your 
Lucky 
Stars, 

which 
came 

out 
only 
a 

week after the 
announcement, 
the band say-
ing they didn’t 
want to release 
it with a traditional campaign. 
Beach House wanted Thank Your 
Lucky Stars to “simply enter the 
world and exist.” As the a fairly 
sadder conclusion to the simplicity 
Depression Cherry was searching 
for, the newest release does seem 
to, well, simply exist. 

Depression Cherry was a mel-

lowed out Beach House reverting 
to its synth and slide-guitar roots. 
Teen Dream and Bloom have driven 
them into the spotlight in front of 
larger audiences in bigger venues, 
which the band said was taking 
an emotional toll. If they weren’t 
already 
emotional-verging-on-

spiritual, Depression Cherry took 
them beyond the verge. Their state-
ments about the album were exten-
sive and heartfelt, from quotes that 
the band felt “relate to the feeling 
and themes of this record,” to a 
track listing with selected lyrics. 
The music was more mellow than 
most of Teen Dream or Bloom, 
described by the band as “a color, 
a place, a feeling, an energy … that 
describes the place you arrive as 
you move through the endlessly 
varied trips of existence.”

Thank Your Lucky Stars seems 

inextricably linked to the spiri-
tuality of its predecessor. The 
tracks on Depression Cherry 
leave listeners unsure of wheth-
er they’re serene or melancholy, 
serenely melancholy or melan-
cholically serene, and Thank 
Your Lucky Stars exacerbates 
this tension between happiness 
in sadness or sadness in happi-
ness. It actually sways listeners 
closer to simple sadness in sad-
ness with titles like “Elegy to 
the Void.” Written directly after 
but recorded at the same time as 
Depression Cherry, it’s just not 
quite as good.

With more of a gristly electric 

guitar — “gristly” being a relative 
term since this is Beach House 
we’re talking about — its songs 
don’t have quite the same perfectly, 
unassumingly, smoothly and ethe-
really rhythmic quality that tracks 
like “Sparks” have on Depres-
sion Cherry. Instead they reveal a 
harder, choppier, more definitively 
melancholy — but not quite defini-
tively melancholy — side to the 
hopeful emptiness hinted upon in 
its August predecessor.

Just like the larger crowds and 

larger venues yielded by earlier 
albums, Thank Your Lucky Stars 
may remind the group adn their 
listeners that too much of a good 
thing can leave you feeling a bit 
empty — perhaps beautifully, 
ethereally, dreamily and softly 
scintillatingly — but empty none-
theless. Beach House may want 
to wait a while before giving any 
more of their pleasing but emo-
tionally dense material to listen-
ers: let the white-capped wave of 
their latest two releases crash and 
ebb, then a refreshing new rhythm 
may begin again.

‘Dopamine’ a strong 
debut from BØRNS

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

BØRNS’s debut studio album, 

Dopamine, is a sleeper album 
— at first listen it’s a typical 
indie-pop-rock 
record, 
but 

with increased 
exposure, 
it 

comes into its 
own. Extreme-
ly 
cohesive, 

nearly to the 
point of vast 
similarity, 
Dopamine plays much like an 
indie romance film. It doesn’t 
have an extravagant budget or 
A-list cameos, but at its core, it’s 
a story worth hearing — over 
and over again.

Opener 
“10,000 
Emerald 

Pools,” as the name may suggest, 
feels submersive; between the 
prominent bass line, relaxed lyr-
ics and underlying excitement 
brought through by the elec-
tric guitar and soaring vocals, 
it pulls you in without telling 
you what’s to come. It also sets 
the tone for the album with 
its sweet, romanticized lyrics 
“You’re all I need to breathe … 
all I need is you.”

“Electric Love” is the ridic-

ulously-in-love montage within 
Dopamine’s love story, its shin-
ing moment coming in the pre-
chorus when the instruments 
all but fade out behind the quiet 
lines “and every night my mind 
is running around her / Thun-

der’s getting louder and loud-
er.” “American Money” builds 
its own value within its depth. 
The darkness in the first verse 
yearns for the assurance in its 
denouement “you are my lover 
for life.” And it’s that short jour-
ney that builds to the ecstasy 
of the track’s chorus. Over the 
next two choruses, the money 
only feels greener and the para-
dise sweeter.

Dopamine 
takes 
a 
few 

moments 
to 
experience 
a 

catharsis in slow-burning, non-
descript “The Emotion.” What 
emotion? All of them. It’s not 
sadness or loneliness or empti-
ness or even hopefulness. It’s all 
of these and none of these — it’s 
feeling whatever there is to feel 
and feeling it wholly. The slight 
change in energy between the 
choruses showcases the ephem-
eralness of most emotions in the 
greater picture. But, not long 
after, the euphoric love returns 
on “Past Lives.” Celebrating 
the perfection of fate, a quick 
bassline assisted by a handful 
of synths the track leaves but-
terflies in the stomach and one 
line in listeners’ heads: “Our 
love is deeper than the oceans 
of water.”

Title-track 
“Dopamine” 
is 

clearly the orgasmic, climactic, 
most-intense track on the album 
as told by its heavy production. 
It’s the culmination of this musi-
cal high that is BØRNS and the 
story he crafts throughout the 
LP. It says explicitly what the 

other tracks failed to make as 
painfully obvious as it is. “I 
wanna feel that stream of dopa-
mine … baby can you take away 
my pain.” Because isn’t that one 
the best of a romance? You feel 
ridiculously (maybe even stu-
pidly) happy and that person 
somehow manages to take away 
the pain, whatever it may be. 
Even though ‘Dopamine’ was 
the musical climax, the physical 
sex of the album was saved for 
“Overnight Sensation.” Domi-
nated by keys and percussion, 
the track wants you to know it’s 
about sex, but the physicality 
is rooted so deeply in Garrett 
Borns’ emotions (and the listen-
ers’ for that matter) that it main-
tains its sweetness.

“The Fool” closes the album 

in the same way credits end a 
movie. It’s the “all the hard stuff 
looks like it’s over, let’s dance” 
finale. The slight ’70s grooves, 
light delivery and intermittent 
clapping doesn’t allow listen-
ers to decide its emotion — it 
decides for itself.

Dopamine is one of those 

albums that loses much of its 
artistic depth if it’s never lis-
tened to in its chronological 
entirety. BØRNS’ sound is origi-
nal and, over the album’s 40 
minutes, it deviates within itself 
but never beyond. However, the 
story woven within the tracks 
and just the right amount of 
surprises throughout to keep it 
playing all the way through — 
and possibly all weekend.

Sports
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“They played their guts out,” said 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“We played winning football, over-
came so much … we messed up that 
play at the end.

“(I) told them to have resolve, put 

steel in their spines, and we’ll move 
forward.”

For much of the game, little went 

right for the 12th-ranked Wolver-
ines (2-1 Big Ten, 5-2 overall). Few of 
the eight reviews were overturned 
in their favor, and they lost one of 
their captains, senior linebacker Joe 
Bolden, to ejection following a con-
troversial targeting call.

But still, behind strong per-

formances on special teams and 
defense, Michigan never trailed and 
was about to hold off the Spartans 
for a 23-21 win.

That is, until the last play.
In a play that will be remembered 

in the state of Michigan for genera-
tions, O’Neill’s frantic fumble was 

recovered by safety Jalen Watts-
Jackson with 10 seconds left. A 
swarm of Spartans protected the 
redshirt freshman as he scrambled 
38 yards into the end zone and 
Michigan State lore.

Though the game grew more 

hectic by the quarter, it began as a 
prototypical Big Ten slugfest. Mich-
igan mustered just three plays in the 
first quarter and 92 yards in the first 
half, but held a 10-7 lead at the break.

The first review of the game 

came on senior fullback Sione Hou-
ma’s two-yard touchdown run to 
make it 7-0 early in the second quar-
ter. The play stood, but the Wolver-
ines weren’t as lucky on the second 
review just minutes later, when 
Bolden was ejected from the game 
for a controversial targeting call 
that Harbaugh later called “hard to 
fathom.”

Michigan State scored its first 

touchdown just two plays later.

The third quarter saw a more 

open playbook for the Wolverines — 
the highlight of which came when 
redshirt freshman safety Jabrill 

Peppers took his first offensive 
carry 28 yards to Michigan State’s 
3-yard line.

Junior running back De’Veon 

Smith appeared to find the end zone 
on the next two plays, but both were 
called back upon review. Houma 
found the end zone again on the 
next play, though that play, too, was 
reviewed. That time, the call was 
not overturned.

The Spartans outgained the Wol-

verines, 386-230, and looked stron-
ger than any team had in the passing 
game against Michigan.

Instead, strong special teams 

kept Michigan on top. Former walk-
on and senior kicker Kenny Allen 
tallied a career-high three field 
goals, Peppers compiled 116 return 
yards and O’Neill averaged nearly 
45 yards on seven punts.

“The guys brought big play to a 

big game,” Harbaugh said. “There 
were calls that were made, calls 
that weren’t made, but the guys kept 
fighting.”

But it was O’Neill’s eighth punt — 

the one that never was — that will go 

down in infamy.

Eventually, after the Spartans 

had finished the celebration and 
the officials ruled the game over, 
the fans that were frozen in the 
moment got up. As they filed out 
of Michigan Stadium, the stunned 
silence lingered in the cool October 
air. Any Spartan fans daring enough 
to break the silence were treated to 
screams to be quiet.

They weren’t the typical shouts 

heard at stadiums. They were bro-
ken hearts screaming out of des-
peration, still in denial of the game’s 
final play. What began as a typi-
cally loud, rambunctious intra-state 
rivalry between two top-15 teams 
had become a war zone.

What was supposed to be Michi-

gan State’s demise had become a 
miraculous moment. What was 
meant to be a Michigan win had 
become a loss.

To the stunned fans, it wasn’t fair. 

But it didn’t matter.

“We played winning football and 

didn’t get the result,” Harbaugh 
said. “Welcome to football.”

to make a game-winning tackle in 
the backfield, or maybe break up 
a pass to end the game. That was 
supposed to be his final imprint 
on the rivalry.

But the lasting image of Bolden 

against Michigan State took 
place in the north end zone, and 
it wasn’t with the Paul Bunyan 
Trophy in his arms.

He had been thrown on top of 

Michigan State’s Connor Cook 
as the quarterback slid. His 
helmet collided with Cook’s and 
he was ejected for targeting in a 
play Harbaugh said was “hard to 

fathom.” Bolden had to leave the 
field for the rest of the game.

So he did what a captain does. 

His eyes red and his heart full, he 
ran around the end zone, all the 
way to the tunnel. He pumped 
his arms the whole way, jumping 
and hollering for the crowd to 
get riled up and behind his team. 
It worked. The crowd screamed, 
and the captain received an 
appropriate sendoff.

Still, it wasn’t what he 

deserved. Even before he was a 
captain, Bolden served as a de 
facto team spokesman during last 
year’s struggles. Greg Mattison, 
then Michigan’s defensive 
coordinator, once said he wished 
he had 11 Joe Boldens in his 
meeting room. He’s known as a 
leader in the locker room, setting 
an example the rest of the players 
look up to.

The passion Michigan’s 

coaching staff loves put Bolden 
in the middle of controversy last 
year before the rivalry game. 
He drove a stake into the turf of 
Spartan Stadium before the 35-11 
loss, in a move meant to motivate 
his team. Instead, it motivated 
the Spartans, and embarrassed 
Michigan. Michigan State coach 
Mark Dantonio used it as yet 
another example of disrespect. 
Brady Hoke issued an apology.

Saturday was supposed to 

change things. It was a chance to 
put a stake in Michigan State’s Big 
Ten championship hopes. It was a 
chance to move on from the years 
of being bullied and beaten.

Bolden recorded two tackles 

before his ejection, and many 
more were left on the table.

He couldn’t do anything else 

other than give his very last ounce 

of energy to firing up the crowd.

It wasn’t supposed to end this 

way.

N

ot for Blake O’Neill. 
He took the low snap 
and bobbled it with 10 

seconds remaining. You already 
know what happened next.

What you might not remember 

is his story. O’Neill is in the 
middle of his second year in the 
United States and his second 
playing college football. He came 
to Ann Arbor during the summer, 
for the chance to play big-time 
college football.

His family lives on the other 

side of the world in Australia, 
where they watch his games in 
the middle of the night. O’Neill 
earned his undergraduate degree 

in his home country and wanted 
to see the world and further his 
education, so he began attending 
ProKick Australia, a kicking 
academy, to learn how to play 
American football.

He starred in his one year 

at Weber State, ranking sixth 
in the Football Championship 
Subdivision in yards per punt. 
Then he came to Michigan, 
where he was at first in awe of 
the crowds and the passion for 
football.

Never more did he feel that 

passion than in the hours before 
his final mistake. O’Neill pumped 
his fist and gestured after an 
80-yard punt just a few minutes 
into the game. The crowd was 
overjoyed, as it seldom is because 
of a punter. O’Neill’s teammates 
mobbed him on the sideline. 
Harbaugh gave him a pat on the 

head.

O’Neill was shaping up to be a 

hero Saturday, a guy who flipped 
the field position battle almost 
every time he touched the ball. 
Three of his seven punts were 
downed inside Michigan State’s 
20-yard line. The Wolverines 
might never have held the lead if 
it weren’t for O’Neill.

But the eighth punt never 

happened. That punt, the game-
sealing one, was supposed to 
roll down the Spartans’ end of 
the field, where no return man 
waited. It was supposed to roll 
until the clock hit zero and “The 
Victors” played.

What was supposed to happen 

did not. The snap was low and 
bobbled. O’Neill tried and tried, 
but he could not gain control and 
the ball flew into the air. It ended 
up in Michigan’s end zone, in the 
hands of Jalen Watts-Jackson, 
where nobody ever thought it 
could.

And all you could do was sit 

there and wonder: How did that 
happen?

If December 30, the day 

Michigan announced the hiring 
of Jim Harbaugh, was supposed 
to be the day marking the 
Wolverines’ return to college 
football’s elite, Saturday was 
going to be the coronation. It 
was going to be the day when 
Michigan defeated its top-10 
instate rival for just the second 
time in eight years, when you 
could finally turn to your cousin 
or your dad or your little brother 
who went to Michigan State and 
tell them that your school was 
finally back, for real this time.

But then came the play you 

don’t want to relive, the one 
you’ll never forget. So you sat 
there, your head in your hands, 
wondering how it all came to be.

Freshman forward Francis Atuahene scored his 10th goal of the season to put Michigan ahead of Valparaiso for good.
‘M’ stifles Valparaiso

By ORION SANG

For the Daily

Despite gusting winds that 

affected play, the Michigan men’s 
soccer team beat Valparaiso, 1-0, 
Monday night.

Freshman midfielder Francis 

Atuahene 
continued 
his 
torrid 

scoring pace with his 10th goal 
of the season, providing the 
Wolverines the only tally they 
needed. Atuahene struck in the 
50th minute off a crisp pass from 
senior forward William Mellors-
Blair.

Michigan (2-1-2 Big Ten, 7-3-3 

overall) controlled possession for 
most of the first half and outshot 
the Crusaders, 19-12, but the 
Wolverines were initially unable 
to finish their chances against 
Valparaiso (6-4-4).

The wind presented problems 

to both the Wolverines’ offense 
and defense.

“It was a grind,” Mellors-Blair 

said. “We played a lot of long balls, 
and the wind was killing that. 
With his leg and the wind, their 
keeper put a lot of pressure on our 
center-backs to make clearances.”

Redshirt sophomore midfielder 

Tyler 
Anderson 
provided 

Michigan with its first major 
opportunity eight minutes into 

the game when he unleashed a 
blast from 25 yards out that was 
saved by Valparaiso goalkeeper 
Nico Campbell.

Atuahene also generated two 

more early chances of his own, 
but both shots were deflected out 
of bounds.

Though Michigan headed into 

the locker room still needing to 
break the scoreless tie, the team 
was optimistic.

“The 
first 
half 
we 
had 

possession, and we knew we only 
needed one chance to score,” 
Mellors-Blair 
said.

Added 

Michigan 
coach 
Chaka 

Daley: 
“We 

created 
OK 

chances 
in 

the first half. 
There was a 
lot of stuff from distance. We 
encouraged the guys to be a little 
more patient and to pass it east 
and west.”

The Wolverines came out in 

the second half and continued 
their strong play, immediately 
controlling tempo and possession 
like they had in the first half.

But 
in 
the 
50th 
minute, 

Atuahene broke the stalemate.

Mellors-Blair made a run down 

the right side before playing the 

ball into the box past a defender, 
where Atuahene buried the ball 
into the back of the net.

The freshman sensation now 

has goals in seven of the last eight 
games and is the nation’s leading 
scorer.

When asked about Atuahene’s 

play, Daley was sure to pass the 
credit around.

“It’s not a one-man show,” 

Daley said. “He’s the beneficiary 
of a lot of good work. Francis was 
hungry enough to be in the right 
spot tonight.”

Valparaiso 

was 
unable 

to 
find 
an 

equalizer 
to 

Atuahene’s 
goal, 
and 

Michigan 
emerged with 
a win.

“I 
thought 

the guys played well,” Daley said. 
“We dominated the ball from 
start to finish.”

The Wolverines only have 

four games left before the Big 
Ten Tournament, but their coach 
certainly isn’t looking ahead after 
a game in which their play was not 
reflected on the scoreboard.

Next time, before they even 

think about the postseason, the 
Wolverines will have to convert 
their chances.

Defense lifts Wolverines 
again in another shutout

Michigan’s back 

line holds off 

Valparaiso despite 

gusty winds

By AZALEA HINOJOSA

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s soccer 

team’s defense was the deciding 
factor during Monday night’s 
game against Valparaiso, giving 
the Wolverines much-needed 
momentum throughout in the 
face of 20-m.p.h. winds.

For the offense, it meant 

taking direct shots from a 
close distance. For the defense, 
it 
meant 
clearing 
the 
ball 

frequently, and with extra force.

But it was nothing the team 

couldn’t handle.

“I thought the wind would be 

a huge factor as soon as I woke 
up and walked outside of the 
house,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley.

The Wolverines (2-1-2 Big Ten, 

7-3-3 overall) outshot Valparaiso 
(2-1-2 Horizon League, 6-4-4) 
19-12, but it was only one shot off 
the foot of freshman midfielder 
Francis Atuahene that found its 
way inside the net. Michigan 
handed the opposition a 1-0 
loss, marking the Wolverines’ 
fifth shutout this season less 
than a week 
after defeating 
Duquesne, 
3-0.

Senior 

forward 
William 
Mellors-
Blair assisted 
Atuahene in the lone goal and 
took four shots of his own, but he 
credited junior defenders Lars 
Eckenrode and Rylee Woods 
and sophomore defender Billy 
Stevens for the win.

The three defenders worked 

tirelessly 
to 
protect 
their 

goal, often forcing turnovers 
from the Crusaders. Michigan 
maintained control of the ball 

for the majority of the first half, 
holding Valparaiso to just four 
shots.

“(Valparaiso’s) goalkeeper is 

6-foot-4,” 
Mellors-Blair 
said. 

“He’d kick the ball from their 

18 to our 18. 
That put a lot 
of 
pressure 

on our back 
line to make 
clearances, 
and they did a 
great job.”

Of the 12 

shots taken by the Crusaders, 
only one in the second half 
proved to be a good scoring 
chance. 
But 
even 
then, 

sophomore 
goalkeeper 
Evan 

Louro dove for the critical 
save. He blocked three shots 
throughout the game, with the 
wind favoring Michigan as it 
helped redirect the other nine 
Valparaiso attempts.

On the other end, the weather 

obstructed 
the 
Wolverines’ 

chances to score on nine corner 
kicks. However, with the ball 
almost always in motion on 
the Crusaders’ side of the field, 
though, the Michigan defense 
was not always being pressured.

“When the defense was called 

upon, they did what they had to 
do,” Louro said.

Added Daley: “We continued 

to play, and more than anything, 
defend very strongly. That kept 
us going, kept the momentum 
going in the right direction.”

While it is an offense that puts 

numbers on the scoreboard, it is 
the defense that can withhold 
the opponent from doing the 
same. And with the turbulent 
wind suppressing Michigan’s 
attackers, the defense was all 
the Wolverines could rely on. 
Luckily for them, that element of 
the game stayed consistent.

Freshman Connor stars in win

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

It was late in the second period, 

and the Michigan hockey team 
was facing a threat. Mercyhurst 
had just tied the game at two.

But 16 minutes into the frame, 

freshman forward Kyle Connor 
came to the rescue.

The 

Michigan 
rookie 
found space 
on the right wing and sniped the 
side netting to light the lamp and 
give the Wolverines a 3-2 lead.

Michigan didn’t look back from 

there, and in a gritty, back-and-
forth game, that score held for the 
11th-ranked Wolverines (2-0).

“I liked the way that we battled 

at the end,” said junior center JT 
Compher. “We were winning 
races, getting pucks out and 
playing the way that we’ve been 
talking about for the last month — 
good defensive hockey. I liked that 
better than scoring six or seven 
goals.”

The Wolverines commanded 

play in the first period, but it took 
them 17 minutes to find the back 
of the net.

After 
junior 
defenseman 

Michael Downing fired a shot 
just inside the blue line, junior 
forward Alex Kile found himself 
in the right place at the right time. 
The puck rebounded down near 
the crease, and Kile found twine 
to give the Wolverines a 1-0 lead.

The even score line prior to 

the goal was far from indicative 
of Michigan’s performance in the 
opening 20 minutes.

The 
Wolverines 
applied 

pressure 
and 
prevented 

Mercyhurst (2-0 Atlantic Hockey 
Conference, 3-3 overall) from 
maintaining 
any 
legitimate 

possession in its offensive zone 
while outshooting the Lakers 19 
to five.

Michigan’s 
most 
dangerous 

offensive opportunities in the 
first frame came off the stick of 
Compher.

In 
the 
10th 
minute, 
the 

Wolverine captain picked up 
the puck at center ice and beat a 
Mercyhurst defenseman one-on-
one before firing a shot just high 
of the net.

Despite missing the target, 

Compher’s shot almost found the 
net — rebounding off the glass 
and deflecting off of Mercyhurst 
goaltender Brandon Wildung’s 
shoulder just wide of the net.

Just minutes later, Compher 

generated a similar threat, once 
again using his stick skills to 
break through the defense before 
whipping a shot that was corralled 
by Wildung.

But Michigan’s dominance to 

open the game didn’t last long.

Two minutes into the second 

period, the Lakers took advantage 
of a power play to even the game 
at one. Though junior goaltender 
Zach Nagelvoort deflected the 
first effort by forward Kyle Cook, 
the puck fell in front of the net and 
forward Jack Riley finished an 
easy tap-in.

The 
Wolverines 
responded 

quickly. Four minutes later, junior 
center Max Shuart picked up a 
puck on the left side of the ice and 

attacked a two-on-one situation. 
He threaded the needle to junior 
forward Evan Allen, who coolly 
finished to recapture the lead.

It seemed as if Michigan 

couldn’t hold onto any lead it 
gained, however.

Just six minutes after Allen’s 

goal, the Wolverines were caught 
in 
a 
dangerous 
two-on-one 

situation of its own.

Mercyhurst forward Taylor 

Best caught the Wolverines on 
a counter and carried the puck 
into the offensive zone, drawing 
the 
coverage 
of 
sophomore 

defenseman Cutler Martin, before 
firing on goal. Nagelvoort made 
the initial save, but his sprawling 
effort on the rebound wasn’t 
enough, as forward Jonathan 
Charbonneau put it away to tie the 
game for a second time.

Though Michigan tallied 45 

shots, Connor’s was the final goal 
of the night, as neither team could 
find twine in the third period.

The 
Wolverines’ 
lead 
was 

in jeopardy at one point in the 
final period, however. With five 
minutes left in the game, Martin 
was sent to the penalty box for 
interference. 
But 
Michigan’s 

penalty killing unit went to work, 
allowing the Lakers only one 
shot and earning the approval of 
Michigan coach Red Berenson.

“Everybody was dialed in. We 

fronted the shots or blocked shots, 
and we didn’t give up any good 
shots,” Berenson said. “There’s 
a part of the game (when) you 
can sense desperation, and I like 
our team when we play with 
desperation. That was part of (the 
penalty kill).”

After allowing four goals on 

Friday, the Wolverine defense 
was stifling, allowing just 21 
shots to Mercyhurst — a result 
of Berenson’s decision to replace 
forward Niko Porikos with junior 
defenseman Kevin Lohan.

Nagelvoort, 
who 
replaced 

Friday’s starter Steve Racine 
in net, anchored the defensive 
unit with 19 saves — including a 
barrage of shots just in front of net 
during the final minutes of play.

While the Wolverines weren’t 

perfect, they finished their season-
opening 
homestand 
with 
the 

number two in the win column. 
And in comparison to last season’s 
shaky start, Michigan will take the 
victories, perfect or not.

Goalies capable 
in ‘M’ victories

Racine and 

Nagelvoort both 

started this 

weekend

By MINH DOAN 

Daily Sports Editor

With less than 7:30 left in the 

game and the No. 11 Michigan 
hockey 
team 
up 
3-2, 
Zach 

Werenski held the puck inside 
the left circle, just a few feet away 
from the Wolverine net.

The usually steady sophomore 

defenseman took two steps and 
pushed the puck forward before 
being stripped by Mercyhurst 
forward Jack Riley, who had 
already scored once for the 
Lakers.

Riley took two steps before 

firing at the Michigan net. 
But 
junior 
goaltender 
Zach 

Nagelvoort was up to the task, 
sliding across the crease and 
making a blocker-board save to 
deny Riley the game-tying goal.

Later in the game, with the 

time winding down and an empty 
net behind it, Mercyhurst (2-0 
Atlantic Hockey Conference, 3-2 
overall) pushed forward, looking 
for its elusive third goal of the 
night to tie the game.

Again, Nagelvoort was up to 

the task, stopping a flurry of shots 
in the final minute en route to a 
3-2 Wolverines victory.

“I thought (Nagelvoort) played 

fine,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “He wasn’t tested a 
lot, and when he was, in crucial 
times — isolated chances — he 
was good.”

Friday 
night, 
it 
was 
a 

different goaltender in the net 
for the Wolverines (2-0). Senior 
goaltender Steve Racine started 
the game in Michigan’s season 

opener after Berenson and the 
coaching staff saw a “slight edge” 
in his play leading up to the game.

While Racine gave up two more 

goals than Nagelvoort, the senior 
finished with 26 saves compared 
to Nagelvoort’s 19 on Sunday.

“I thought he played good,” 

Berenson said. “He didn’t play 
great, he played good. I can’t tell 
you there were bad goals, but any 
goalie will tell you when they give 
up four goals, you say ‘I should’ve 
got that one,’ or ‘I could’ve got 
that one.’ ”

But as the scoreboard showed, 

neither 
Michigan 
goaltender 

was perfect. The duo allowed six 
goals combined on the weekend, 
and each goaltender allowed at 
least one tally that they could 
have been reasonably expected 
to stop.

On Mercyhurst’s first goal 

Friday, Racine was beaten stick-
side on a shot from Lakers forward 
Kyle Cook. On Mercyhurst’s 
second goal Sunday, Nagelvoort 
gave up a big rebound that Laker 
forward Jonathan Charbonneau 
was able finish to knot the game 
at two.

But neither goaltender was 

completely at fault. Four of the six 
goals came on odd-man rushes, 
and in most scenarios, there 
wasn’t much they could do.

At the end of both games, 

Berenson said Racine was “fine” 
and Nagelvoort was “good,” but 
neither was excellent.

But both netminders were 

capable, as they helped Michigan 
earn two wins to start off the 
season.

And with so many games left to 

play, that’s all that matters right 
now.

“We have two goalies that can 

play,” Berenson said. “Don’t be 
surprised if you see both of them. 
Or if one of them gets hot, we’ll 
play the hot goalie.”

Michigan earns draw

By TYLER COADY

For the Daily

With both teams jockeying for 

a spot near the top of the Big Ten 
standings, Sunday’s matchup in 
Minneapolis 
between the 
Michigan 
women’s 
soccer team and No. 11 Minnesota 
was set to be a tight one. After 
regulation and two overtime 
periods, neither side could could 
claim three points, and the two 
settled for a scoreless draw.

The Wolverines (5-2-2 Big 

Ten, 10-5-2 overall) entered 
the game coming off a 3-2 loss 
to Wisconsin, in which they 
blew a 2-0 lead in the last 30 
minutes. Despite late defensive 
breakdowns against the Badgers, 
the Michigan defense looked 
rejuvenated against the Golden 
Gophers (6-2-1, 11-3-3).

Minnesota started the game 

strong 
offensively, 
generating 

numerous chances. Despite the 
scoring opportunities, Michigan 

sophomore goalkeeper Megan 
Hinz stood tall to keep the Golden 
Gophers at bay. Hinz recorded 
one of her best outings of the 
season, stopping all six shots she 
faced for her fourth shutout

“I am really pleased with our 

grit and effort day,” said Michigan 
coach Greg Ryan. “I loved the way 
that we played defensively.”

The 
Wolverines, 
despite 

giving up some good chances, 
also had offensive forays of 
their 
own. 
Junior 
forward 

Nicky Waldeck put a header 
just over the bar in the 15th 
minute, and redshirt sophomore 
forward Ani Sarkisian, who has 
scored seven goals this season, 
proved difficult to contain as 
she notched three shots in the 
match, though neither could find 
the back of the net.

In the second half, Michigan’s 

defense stifled Minnesota and 
held its opponent to only one 
shot in the final 60 minutes. The 
Golden Gophers are now scoreless 
in their last two matches.

On the other side of the ball, 

the Wolverines had possession 
in Minnesota’s territory for long 
stretches as they notched five 
shots on net in the frame. Their 
best 
chances 
came 
through 

sophomore 
midfielder 
Emma 

Groffsky and junior defender 
Melissa Kreutz, whose shots 
tested Minnesota’s goalkeeper.

In overtime, both teams failed 

to muster any concrete scoring 
chances. 
Michigan 
recorded 

just two shots. By the end of the 
second overtime period, both 
teams appeared as if they were 
content with settling for a draw.

The Wolverines are still just 

two points back of the Golden 
Gophers, but are now five points 
behind 
conference-leading 

Wisconsin. Michigan has two 
games left to play, a home match 
against Purdue and an away 
contest at Penn State.

“We are in a good spot right 

now,” Ryan said. “We need to be 
better attacking and we need to 
finish our chances, but if we can 
play with this kind of effort, we 
will get to where we want to be.”

Wolverines win twice

By LELAND MITCHINSON 

Daily Sports Writer

In its second overtime period 

against Northwestern on Friday 
night, the Michigan field hockey 
team knew it was playing on the 
edge. One goal either way would 
end the game.

Fortunately 
for 
the 

11th-ranked Wolverines, the final 
goal came off the stick of senior 
defender Lauren Thomas on a 
penalty corner shot from the top 
of the circle, winning the game, 
4-3.

“Honestly at first I was so 

tired, I was just happy that it was 
over,” Thomas said. “It’s always a 
good feeling knowing that you’ve 
kind of done that for the team, 
and everyone had worked so 
hard for the whole game that it 
felt really good to be able to top 
it off.”

The game began in almost the 

exact opposite way for Michigan 
(5-1 Big Ten, 13-3 overall), as 
the Wildcats scored their own 
penalty corner just over a minute 
into the game.

The 
Wolverines 
answered, 

however, 
as 
sophomore 

midfielders Katie Trombetta and 
Veerle Lubbers scored back-to-
back goals within 30 seconds of 
one another to give Michigan the 
2-1 lead.

Northwestern 
(3-3, 
10-6) 

opened the second half with its 
own pair of consecutive goals to 
reclaim the lead.

Down 3-2 with less than 

five 
minutes 
remaining, 
the 

Wolverines needed someone to 
step up if they had any hope of 
defeating the Wildcats on the 
road.

Senior 
forward 
Shannon 

Scavelli was there when her 
team needed her, and slotted one 
past Northwestern goalkeeper 
Lindsay von der Luft to knot the 
game at three.

The Wolverines’ defense, led 

by strong play from sophomore 
goalkeeper Sam Swenson, held off 
late pressure from Northwestern 
to send the game to overtime.

In the first overtime period, 

the teams battled back and forth 
to try to gain an advantage. With 
time expiring, the Wildcats won 

a penalty corner and a chance 
to close out the game. Swenson 
was at the top of her game yet 
again, making one of her career-
best 14 saves. Eight of Swenson’s 
saves came after regulation — an 
effort that sent the game to a 
second overtime period, when 
Thomas scored her eventual 
game winner.

“You really have to focus on not 

letting your nerves get to you, and 
just (try to) organize your team,” 
Swenson said. “I try and get rid of 
my nerves by talking to the team, 
getting everyone in the right place 
and getting everyone set for their 
best scenarios. You just have to 
really focus on the game and not 
even think about the possibility of 
what could happen.”

After its overtime thriller, 

Michigan traveled to Central 
Michigan 
to 
take 
on 
the 

Chippewas. 
Unlike 
their 

battle with Northwestern, the 
Wolverines had no trouble this 
time on their way to a 4-0 victory 
Sunday.

Redshirt sophomore forward 

Carly Bennett opened the scoring 
for Michigan with her first goal 
of the season, and fellow redshirt 
sophomore 
Allie 
Sardo 
and 

Thomas each added goals to make 

it a 3-0 halftime lead.

“Today we definitely couldn’t 

underestimate them,” Thomas 
said. “It was important for us to 
get the goals that we did get early 
on, and although I’m a defensive 
player, being on the penalty 
corner attack there are huge 
chances for us to get the goals and 
win the game, so to be a part of 
that is really big.”

The 
Wolverine 
defense 

completely shut down Central 
Michigan, 
not 
allowing 
the 

Chippewas to take a shot in the 
first half.

Trombetta scored her second 

goal of the weekend to put a cap 
on a successful weekend for 
Michigan.

“It’s not an easy thing to come 

off a big double-overtime win 
and then have to drive two and 
a half hours on the same day you 
are going to play,” said Michigan 
coach Marcia Pankratz. “I was 
proud of the team for staying 
focused. ... It’s a big win.”

Though the Wolverines come 

away from the weekend with 
two important victories, there is 
no time to relax, as they face off 
against rivals Michigan State and 
Ohio State in the final two weeks 
of the season.

Five Things We Learned

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The last play of Saturday’s 

game against Michigan State 
spoiled the Michigan football 
team’s 
undefeated 
Big 
Ten 

record, snapped its five-game 
winning streak and put a serious 
dent in its Big Ten championship 
hopes.

But before that play, the 

Wolverines and their in-state 
rivals were more even than they 
had been in three years. The 
Spartans never led Saturday’s 
game until time expired.

Michigan gets a bye this week 

before its next game at Minnesota 
on Oct. 31. Until then, here are five 
things we learned from Saturday’s 
game:

1. Jourdan Lewis vs. Aaron 
Burbridge is the best wide 
receiver-defensive 
back 

matchup we’ll see all season.

Let’s put it this way: Lewis, 

who guarded Burbridge all day, 
had six pass breakups in the 
game — and Burbridge still pulled 
down nine catches for 132 yards.

About half of Michigan State 

quarterback 
Connor 
Cook’s 

throws went to Burbridge, and 
on many of them, it was hard 
to find anything Burbridge or 
Lewis could have done better. 
If Burbridge made the catch, he 
grabbed the ball at the highest 
point 
despite 
tight 
coverage 

from Lewis (who is three inches 
shorter). If Lewis broke it up, 
Burbridge was right there, ready 
to take it if not for Lewis.

Both players have drawn praise 

for their play all year, and it’s no 
longer a stretch to call them the 
best at their positions in the Big 
Ten.

Burbridge now leads the Big 

Ten with 100.3 yards per game, 
and Lewis now has 14 pass 
breakups and two interceptions, 
including one he returned for a 
touchdown.

2. This rivalry is back to being 
closely contested up front.

The 
Spartans 
dominated 

Michigan at the line of scrimmage 
in each of their previous two 
meetings. To have a chance to win 
Saturday, the Wolverines needed 
to compete better in the trenches, 
and they did.

Sure, 
excluding 
sacks 
and 

the muffed punt play at the end, 
Michigan rushed for just 87 yards 
on 29 carries. Fifth-year senior 
quarterback Jake Rudock was 
sacked three times. But Michigan 
State didn’t fare much better: 
Excluding sacks, the Spartans 
totaled an almost-identical 85 
yards on 28 rushes. The meager 
numbers there were more a 
product of both defenses being 
strong.

3. Jabrill Peppers is ready to 

be a threat in all three phases.

After a long year and a half of 

anticipation, 
Michigan 
finally 

broke out its wild card, playing 
redshirt freshman safety Jabrill 
Peppers 
on 
offense 
against 

Michigan State.

Fans had been waiting since 

Peppers stepped on campus to 
see the athlete in all three phases. 
Injuries 
hampered 
him 
last 

season, but he made an impact on 
special teams in the first six games 
this season. Finally, he caught two 
passes for 35 yards Saturday. He 
was easily Michigan’s leader in 
all-purpose yards with 164 — 35 
receiving, 81 kick return and 48 
punt return — despite limited 
action on offense.

For now, the Wolverines’ usage 

of Peppers on offense appears 
to give them a psychological 
edge, too. Michigan State coach 
Mark 
Dantonio 
called 
two 

consecutive 
timeouts 
when 

Harbaugh first inserted Peppers 
alongside Rudock in the first 
half. Considering his production, 
perhaps opponents can expect 
to see more of the same in the 

coming weeks.

4. The passing game still hasn’t 
established a consistent threat.

Michigan’s aerial attack finally 

played a significant role Saturday, 
after 
five 
straight 
blowout 

victories required little in the 
way of downfield passing. Rudock 
missed on a couple of long throws, 
finishing with 168 yards on 15 
completions.

Those aren’t bad numbers, 

especially 
considering 
the 

Wolverines rely more on their 
power running game and defense 
to push them ahead.

But with the passing game 

on trial for the first time 
since 
the 
season 
opener, 

there didn’t appear to be a 
consistent 
receiving 
weapon. 

Redshirt junior Amara Darboh 
leads Michigan with just 28 
receptions, 332 yards and two 
touchdowns. His yardage total 
ranks 13th in the Big Ten.

5. 
Bold 
Prediction: 
The 

Michigan defense earns another 
shutout against Minnesota.

The Wolverines could respond 

to Saturday’s devastating loss in 
two possible ways. They could 
come out flat in their next game 
and let Michigan State beat 
them twice, or they could come 
out angry and eager to prove 
themselves again. Here’s guessing 
the latter.

The reason is a combination of a 

bye this week, a relentless mindset 
from Harbaugh and what’s sure to 
be a fiery performance by senior 
linebacker Joe Bolden, who can’t 
be happy about being ejected from 
his final Michigan State game. 
Meanwhile, Minnesota dropped 
to 4-3 with a 48-25 home loss to 
Nebraska on Saturday.

Powered by an impassioned 

captain in Bolden, Michigan’s 
defense has all the tools to get 
back to its dominating ways in 
Minneapolis in two weeks.

FOOTBALL
O’Neill comes to 
terms with punt

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Even after one of the most 

devastating losses in Michigan 
football history, Blake O’Neill 
isn’t making excuses. He doesn’t 
seem to be losing much sleep, 
either.

What the fifth-year senior 

punter is doing is getting back to 
work, moving past the fumble on 
the final play of Saturday’s 27-23 
loss to Michigan State to get on 
with his life.

O’Neill 
met 
with 
the 

media Tuesday at Michigan’s 
Schembechler Hall, choosing to 
face the sudden burst of attention 
coming his way, not run from it.

“Why not?” O’Neill said of 

speaking to the media. “I think 
football is a very interesting game. 
There’s ups and downs, highs and 
lows, and I think that’s the beauty 
of it. I’m happy to speak if people 
are willing to listen.”

When faced with questions 

about the logistics of the play, 
O’Neill dispelled rumors of trick 
play options and refused to make 
excuses for the play that ultimately 
lost the Wolverines the game.

“I mean the protection was 

good, the snap was, sort of, in 
my catch zone,” O’Neill said. “If 
anything, put me back out there 
for the next one, I’m sure I’d make 
the kick.”

After the game, the Australian-

rules football convert said he paid 
no attention to Twitter, deciding 
to let the issue cool off before 
checking his account. And when 
he left the locker room, his family 
was in town from Australia. The 
O’Neill family still is, in fact, 
taking in the sights and sounds of 
Ann Arbor.

And for any backlash he 

received, there has also been 
ample positive reinforcement.

“A lot of support from the 

Michigan 
fan 
base, 
from 

teammates, even people back 
home,” O’Neill said. “It’s funny 
that a game over here could get 
all the way back to Australia, 
but it did. But mate, it’s been 
overwhelming, the support I’ve 
received.”

Of course, there are some people 

who can relate to what O’Neill is 
going through better than others, 
including former Michigan and 
NFL kicker Jay Feely. Feely and 
O’Neill got a chance to speak this 
week, and O’Neill was pleased 
with their chat.

As for his teammates, there 

is one that can share the pain 
with O’Neill more than anyone 
else. Redshirt sophomore long 
snapper Scott Sypniewski was 
the one snapping to O’Neill, and 
while the punter maintained 
it was catchable, the two can 
commiserate over the fumble.

“I think we’ll probably be 

bound at the hip for the rest of our 
lives because of that play,” O’Neill 
said.

In the days since, videos of the 

fumble and ensuing touchdown 
return have been running on 
SportsCenter and other highlight 
shows seemingly around the 
clock.

But while it would be easy 

to dwell on the play, O’Neill 
is instead declining to watch 
replays outside of his viewings 
with Michigan special teams 
coach John Baxter.

“To me, it’s an error in a game, 

and if you can learn from it, it’s 
worth looking into,” O’Neill said. 
“But we’ve sort of figured out 
what we can do better and moved 
forward.”

From start to finish of his 

Tuesday 
press 
conference, 

that much was clear. O’Neill 
recognizes his error on the game’s 
final play. But he won’t let it derail 
him further.

The good, the bad and the ugly

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

The Michigan football team 

finds itself with a bye week at 
either the best or worst possible 
time, 
depending 
on 
your 

perspective.

After a deflating last-second 

loss 
to 
Michigan 
State 
on 

Saturday, the Wolverines now 
have two full weeks to prepare 
for 
their 
Halloween 
night 

matchup against Minnesota.

The Daily looks back on the 

good, the bad and the ugly from 
Saturday’s 27-23 loss.

The good

Redshirt 
freshman 
Jabrill 

Peppers finally stole the show, 
and 
he 
was 
breathtaking. 

Peppers accumulated 129 return 
yards, giving Michigan stellar 
field position throughout the 
game. Fans also got their first 
look at him on offense, where 
his mere presence was enough 
to force Michigan State coach 
Mark Dantonio into consecutive 
timeouts in the second quarter.

When 
he 
finally 
got 
an 

offensive touch, a reception in 

the third quarter, he took it for 
28 yards to set up 1st-and-goal. 
He had another catch late in the 
game that was just shy of a first 
down.

Rounding out his impact in 

every phase of the game, he 
added two tackles on defense.

Elsewhere in the secondary, 

junior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 

Lewis was in full view all night. 
Tasked with guarding likely 
All-Big 
Ten 
receiver 
Aaron 

Burbridge, the two Detroit-area 
standouts battled throughout 
the game.

Burbridge finished with nine 

catches for 132 yards, but Lewis 
broke up six passes and made 
seven tackles.

Through seven games, Lewis 

has now broken up 14 passes, just 
four shy of Michigan’s single-
season record.

The bad

The “bad” really came down 

to one play. No, not that play. 
We’ll get to that later.

In 
the 
fourth 
quarter, 

Michigan 
State 
quarterback 

Connor Cook found his fullback 
wide open on a 75-yard wheel 

route. He at first appeared to 
score on the play, but after 
review, he was called down at the 
one-yard line. LJ Scott punched 
it in for Michigan State to cut the 
Wolverines’ lead to two, and you 
know the rest.

The fact that a fullback 

went 75 yards is both a credit 
to the Spartans’ play design 
and indicative of some kind 
of 
coverage 
breakdown 
for 

Michigan. Fullbacks just aren’t 
built to go 75 yards if properly 
covered.

These things happen, and 

Michigan has had its own share 
of big plays from fullbacks this 
year, but it’s hard to ignore the 
importance of this one gaffe 
given the final result of this 
game.

The ugly

Perhaps you’ve seen it by now. 

On the final play of the game, 
fifth-year senior punter Blake 
O’Neill bobbled a low snap and 
tried to get the punt off anyway. 
As he turned to make the ill-
advised second effort, he was 
hit, sending the ball into the 
waiting arms of Jalen Watts-

Jackson.

Watts-Jackson 
ran 
down 

the sideline and into the end 
zone as time expired, ending 
the game in the most shocking 
fashion imaginable. Michigan 
State dominated the yardage all 
game, but the Michigan defense 
and special teams had been 
good enough to earn a win on 
Saturday.

It’s never simply one play 

that costs a team the game, but 
the Wolverines looked secure in 
their lead until this one.

O’Neill had been excellent all 

day, even booming an 80-yard 
punt earlier in the game, the 
longest in the Football Bowl 
Subdivision this season. That’s 
one reason that this one ugly 
play is so hard to swallow for 
Michigan fans.

After a few upset fans made 

unruly comments to O’Neill on 
Twitter, there was an outpouring 
of support from the Michigan 
community 
to 
the 
graduate 

transfer 
punter, 
including 

interim Athletic Director Jim 
Hackett, who posted an open 
letter Sunday afternoon asking 
students to pledge support and 
not turn to spite.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Redshirt freshman Jabrill Peppers totaled a team-high 164 all-purpose yards (35 receiving, 81 kick return, 48 punt return) Saturday against Michigan State.

ear Emma,

I feel like I’m the 

more emotional one in my cur-
rent relationship, and it feels 
very invalidating. I don’t know 
if I should accomodate my part-
ner’s unemotional tendencies or 
if I should demand validation 
and express my feelings to him 
as I want to do. It’s so frustrat-
ing … I feel like I almost always 
feel this way in relationships, 
but then when I’m with some-
one more emotional than me I 
feel like they are too dependent. 
Thoughts?

Thanks,
Feeling Frustrated

Dear Feeling Frustrated,
I’m glad you acknowledged 

this pattern right away in your 
question — because I’m certain 
you’re not alone in wanting to 
keep the mystery and fun in a 
relationship but also wanting 
to feel emotionally satisfied 
with your partner. However, 
scillating between men who 
can’t help but tell you they love 
you at every possible opportu-
nity and men who have a hard 
time telling you you’re even a 
likable gal probably isn’t going 

to result in you eventually 
finding a partner who exactly 
matches your emotional level. 

I’m afraid that your ques-

tion might be best answered 
by this: you can’t have it both 
ways. And frankly, I think your 
situation calls for a serious 
personal evaluation of what 
exactly it is you are seeking in 
a romantic relationship.

I would definitely advise 

you to talk to your partner if 
you believe him being more in 
touch with his emotions and 
expressing those feelings is 
a requirement for you when 
it comes to relationships. It’s 
worth it to consider there may 
be more going on here: you 
don’t feel emotionally satisfied 
because he’s not quite inter-
ested in you with the same 
intensity you are interested in 
him, you both are having diffi-
culty communicating with one 
another or whatever the other 
issues may be.

However, the other side 

to this coin is that you might 
decide there is no issue at all, 
and that you prefer a more 
independent, 
self-sufficient 

partner over one who feels 
clingy and, well, boring. This 
could be just a phase of inse-

curity. But I do think you need 
to decide what you want before 
you confront him. I almost feel 
like addressing these feelings 
of insecurity will be somewhat 
ineffective, because in your 
case asking him to become 
more emotional might lead to 
you becoming disinterested. 
So as much as I am an advo-
cate for the classic ideology 
that promotes communication 
in relationships, be thoughtful 
about this one. Maybe all you 
need is to tell him how you feel 
and have him reassure you of 
his true feelings for you, but you 
may also just need to remind 
yourself of why you are togeth-
er and bring a heightened sense 
of maturity and confidence to 
the relationship. It’s up to you 
to figure out your priorities in 
a relationship and to really be 
honest with him and yourself 
— for you personally, is this 
feeling of invalidation worth 
the romantic mystery a bit of 
emotional distance brings?

Warm regards,
Emma

Who am I?

M

y friend once asked me, 
“When did you stop get-
ting ice cream in a cone 

and instead in a cup?” It was an odd 
question, asked at an odd time, and 
I didn’t have an answer. Crucial to 
this was the fact that we were get-
ting ice cream and I had just gotten 
a cone, but, now that I thought of it, 
yes, I do often ask for a cup.

The same friend also once asked 

me, “When did you stop ordering 
soda at restaurants?” I did have an 
answer for that. “I think around 
senior year,” I replied as I took a sip 
from my complimentary water.

They are quite shocking when 

noticed, these odd signifiers of 
“growing up.” They eat at you, too, 
forcing you to question how and 
when and why you’ve changed so 
much from your younger self.

I always like to think that I was 

better before. It makes me feel bet-
ter to tell myself that I was a more 
fun person to be around back when 
I ordered mint chocolate chip in 
a waffle cone. People liked the 
Nabeel who ordered a Coke at din-
ner better than the Nabeel who’s 
started wearing watches, I say in 
my head.

My aunt once told my mother, 

when I was a sophomore in high 
school, that “Nabeel became so 
quiet.” As any concerned mother 
would do, she told me this, con-
fronted me on our couch in India 
about why I don’t talk that much 
anymore. I told her I didn’t know. 
I looked over and saw my peren-
nially social sister having a very 
lively conversation with a guy who 
had just come to visit and whose 
name I still wouldn’t be able to tell 
you. And thus, I became known as 
“the quiet one.”

Inexplicably, I embraced this 

new identity. I sped through the 
rest of high school as someone who 
rarely opened up to people outside 
his close-knit group of friends, 
the guy who was more prone to 
off-brand reticence than the ubiq-
uitous affability of the time. I was 
being who I was, but I was also 
angry about it. I wished to be like 
those guys who could make friends 
on a deserted island, dreamed 
of having the ability to converse 

freely and openly and well and to 
whomever I wished, yearned for 
the social skills that would never 
sprout within me. My father intro-
duced me as the quiet one, my sis-
ter as the talkative one, and my life 
went on.

Cut to college, where I now find 

myself in a state of limbo. I talk 
to my friends from back home 
almost daily and see my friends 
at Michigan all the time. But I 
didn’t change; I stayed grown up. 
My personality package didn’t 
come equipped with the necessary 
skills to join a fraternity, nor did I 
feel like I could upgrade myself to 
be in one. And what friends I did 

make, I made slowly, steadily, like 
one hikes up a hill—like one isn’t 
“supposed” to do in “college.”

It’s tough to realize you’ve grown 

up — tougher still to realize that 
the way you are is the way you’re 
meant to be. It’s easy to be angry 
at something you can’t change, but 
this is something we’re always told 
we can change. “Reserved” isn’t 
a phase, some ephemeral mood 
swing that fades away when I grew 
up (said my mother to her sister, 
says my mother to herself, I knew, 
I know); it’s a mark, branded upon 
me by the gears of time and neces-
sity and change. I won’t complain. 
I never do.

n 2012, the downtown Ann Arbor area saw 28 new 
businesses.

In 2013, there were 38 more.

By June of 2014, the last time comprehensive data was 

released, another 15 new businesses were already planned for 
the upcoming year.

Their types varied, from a new outpost of Babo’s Market in 

Nickels Arcade to vintage and antique store Thistle and Bess. 
Alongside them, new housing developments were popping up 
as well, with more than ten apartment and condo complexes 
entering or exiting construction over the past few years.

Depending on who you ask, those eighty-four businesses 

represent an upwards trend that’s been happening in the area 
for the past few years. Or the past ten years. Or the past thirty 
years.

Regardless of the timeline, though, the growth is good — 

that’s what a number of downtown stakeholders, from the city 
to business owners to residents to business associations, all 
seem to agree on.

But for many of those same stakeholders, the changing 

face of downtown has also prompted concerns about another 
trend: the sharply rising cost of living in Ann Arbor, and what 
an increasingly prosperous downtown means for the economic 
diversity of the city.

Reasons for growth
It’s difficult to point to just one reason why downtown is 

seeing change and growth, or how development might correlate 
to affluence. The way cities grow and change is complex, and 
Ann Arbor is no exception.

Part of understanding what’s happening to Ann Arbor is a 

question of looking at national trends on prosperity, according 
to City Councilmember Sabra Briere (D–Ward 1), who has been 
active in city politics since 1978.

“Affluence is just one part of this, and that goes across the 

entire country,” she said. “The gap between income brackets 
grows, the people in the middle shrink. And so what that really 
means is that a lot of people who twenty years ago were living 
comfortable lives in a place like Ann Arbor, earning $40,000 a 
year, are confronting the fact that they could not buy a house in 
Ann Arbor now.”

When it comes to the specific patterns of business growth and 

subsequent affluence, Maura Thomson, director of the Main 
Street Area Association, said it’s something a lot of downtowns 
are experiencing nationwide, albeit in different ways and forms.

“I am sure you can go to any downtown in America, and see 

similar patterns,” Thomson said. “But I think those are the 
lucky ones, because I think what you’re going to see in a place 
that isn’t maybe as economically vibrant (as Ann Arbor), is 
you’re going to see downtowns with stores closing but nobody 
filling the space. And we don’t seem to have that problem here.”

Within Ann Arbor, the growth over the past few years seems 

to be connected to a multitude of factors, each influencing the 
city in a different way, from the type of business on the street to 

changes in housing density and average income.

Downtown is frequently divided up into four neighborhoods 

— Main Street, Kerrytown, State Street, and South University 
areas — for planning purposes, and each is experiencing 
changes in a unique way, said Thomson.

“I think you’re going to find a different perspective in each 

one of the four neighborhoods,” she said. “This neighborhood, 
Main Street area, the student impact isn’t as great as, of course, 
South U. and State Street. Each neighborhood is going to have a 
little bit different reflection of the changes that are occurring.”

Maggie Ladd, director of the South University Area 

Association, agreed that different parts of the city were seeing 
different changes.

For the South University and State Street areas, she said 

change over the past years has been largely expressed in the 
balance of businesses, pointing in particular to a higher number 
of retail businesses in the area.

She said she thought the changes had more of a cyclical 

nature, as opposed to a push toward affluence — and that the 
balance between retail and restaurants could already be self-
correcting in another iteration of change.

“It’s cyclical and I think what you’re seeing on State Street 

is more balanced than you’ve seen in the past,” she said. “Their 
mix is beginning to be balanced and that’s because I think 
you have more people living downtown and you have the IT 
businesses going, you have the office workers there so they 
create a demand.”

On Main Street, Thomson said, growth has also been 

signalled through a shift in the type of business, though in 
a different sense, and more definitively in a trend toward 
affluence.

“Our downtown is becoming less available to, perhaps, 

the mom and pop stores and local business that I think a lot 
of people in Ann Arbor were used to,” she said. “So I think 
we see a change, as far as the type of businesses that we see 
downtown, are catering to the more affluent because they are 
businesses that can afford to pay the rent. And in this particular 
neighborhood, we have seen in the last years, we have seen huge 
turnover in the sale of property, and that’s what drives it.”

Thomson cited several of the same factors Ladd did in 

explaining the shifts, pointing to more visitors, Ann Arbor’s 
booming technology sector and higher housing density from the 
new housing developments as a reason for increased prosperity 
in the area.

“I always use cranes as an indicator of a strong economy 

and if you go around downtown Ann Arbor and look, currently 
you’re seeing some cranes up there,” she said. “And it’s also, with 
the increase in residents, we’re also seeing kind of a little bit 
of downtown expanding a bit from what we have traditionally 
thought of as downtown….residents and employers (have a) 
huge impact on our downtown economy.”

Business owners cite a number of reasons why they’ve chosen 

to expand over the past years.

Roger Hewitt is a co-owner of Red Hawk Bar & Grille as well 

as Revive+Replenish, a higher-end restaurant and grocery store 
that opened in the South University area in 2010. He said he and 
his business partner felt that opening a business like Replenish 
made sense in recent years in part because of a customer base in 
the area that could support it.

Speaking to why the downtown area is able to support a 

business like Replenish, as opposed to a more wholesale, less 
high-end grocery store, he pointed to students and the new 
development of high-rises in the area in particular.

“The main thing, if you look at all the student high rises, 

they’re fairly expensive places,” he said. “People there have 
disposable incomes.”

“I think the student body as a whole probably has more of a 

disposable income for groceries than say, the average shopper 
at Meijer,” he added.

Nonetheless, Hewitt, who is also the vice chair of the 

Downtown Development Authority, said he thought the area 
has seen change and prosperity, but not necessarily in the 
direction of higher affluence, pointing in particular instead to 
a rise in mid-priced dining options.

Consequences of change
What development and growth downtown means for the 

city in terms of its economic future is a messy question. Across 
the spectrum, stakeholders in downtown are quick to note that 
there are both positive and negative aspects.

One thing, though, is clear — it’s expensive to live in Ann 

Arbor, much more so than the rest of the state.

Overall, the yearly cost of living in the city for a four-person 

family is currently at $68,302, higher than any other region in 
Michigan, according to the Economic Policy Institute. And, 
according to the 2014 Washtenaw County Housing Needs 
Assessment, 31 percent of Washtenaw County residents don’t 
make enough to afford a two-bedroom apartment in Ann Arbor, 
a figure that includes the median salaries of many jobs located 
in the city.

For Thomson, the question of balance between prosperity 

downtown and affordability is familiar in a personal light.

“I’m one of the people that I live in a near-downtown 

neighborhood, I rent an apartment, that if my rent does go up 
I probably won’t be able to stay this close to downtown and I 
might not even be able to stay in Ann Arbor,” she said.

“Which makes me — you know, I love Ann Arbor, and I’m 

passionate about the job I do, and I think it’s wonderful that 
we’re so successful. But it’s hard for people who maybe aren’t 
in an income bracket that will allow them to continue to stay as 
things continue to increase.”

In a sentiment repeated by many, City Councilmember 

Graydon Krapohl (D–Ward 4) said he thinks the development is 
good, but that there are unresolved issues downtown, especially 
when it comes to housing.

“Any type of growth like that is positive,” Krapohl said. “It 

generates tax revenue. It revitalizes areas. I think the challenge 

Ann Arbor faces with our housing market is workforce housing, 
affordable housing for our workforce. That’s a challenge for us 
and part of it is, you know, we don’t have a lot of land to expand 
to build a lot more housing so a lot of it is redevelopment, and 
redevelopment is expensive.”

Increased housing density — one of the same factors cited 

in discussing reasons for growth — and housing prices seems 
to have become a particularly noticeable issue as growth has 
continued in recent years.

A recent Michigan Daily survey found that locating housing 

downtown is currently so competitive for students that many 
now sign leases 10 to 12 months in advance. For residents 
overall, the County Housing Needs Assessment found that to 
keep up with the number of jobs in the city, 3,137 additional 
workforce housing units would be needed in Ann Arbor over 
the next years.

Workforce housing generally refers to housing that is 

affordable for individuals whose income doesn’t currently 
allow them to find homes within a reasonable distance to their 
workplace, based on the market prices. 

When it comes to pricing, there are upward trends for both 

housing and rents. According to the Ann Arbor Area Board of 
Realtors, in October 2012 the average selling price for a house 
was at $216,465. In April of 2015, it was at $269,321. The median 
sale price of a home in the United States is currently $225,000 
according to Zillow’s housing index.

Rental prices have seen a similar increase, rising by up to 10 

percent in the area for 2014-2015, according to MLive, compared 
with a national average of 3.6 percent.

“Our downtown is definitely gentrifying,” Thomson 

said. “And it’s causing neighborhoods, near downtown 
neighborhoods that were at one time affordable to people who, 
you know, were maybe working in the restaurants or working 
in the shops, it’s becoming so that it isn’t affordable. And I 
think that’s something that our city has recognized, affordable 
housing is a huge issue.”

High cost of living, of course, isn’t only a one-factor issue. 

Briere noted that in Ann Arbor, the income of the population for 
both students and residents, as well as the construction that’s 
part of new development, also plays a big role.

“The reasons for the higher cost of living and therefore the 

sense of increased affluence are complex,” she said. “Some 
of it is how much income people get from their jobs. Some of 
it is they get that income because the cost of living is so high. 
Some of it is we can charge this amount of money for a rental 
unit because U of M students have affluent parents. Part of it 
is that new construction in the downtown is inevitably going 
to be more expensive than older construction. Maybe not 
significantly more expensive, but more expensive.”

For some, the biggest factor in regard to cost of living is that 

the relationship might be flipped — higher affluence in the area 
prompting prosperity downtown, instead of the other way 
around.

Graduate and CEO: Alumni-owned Ann Arbor Businesses

by Melina Glusac, Daily Arts Writer

F

iddling with life aspirations and career possibilities is 
a habit of most daydreaming underclassmen. But by 
the time senior year hits, reality sets in: professional 

success is no longer an elusive figment of the future, but a 
rapidly approaching goal — a must.

“I think it’s funny looking back at that last semester in 

college,” Robby Mayer, co-owner of Salads UP, said. “It was 
almost like trying to learn as much as you can just to justify 
to your parents — or at least I was, that I was not going to get 
a job, that I was going to open up a restaurant.”

And so goes the story for three local food-business own-

ers and University of Michigan alumni: Mayer, Max Steir and 
Nick Lemmer. They took the plunge, and for them, the risk 
has paid off.

Lemmer, twenty-four years old and graduate of the School 

of Information, co-owns Iorio’s Gelateria on East William 
Street. Along with his older sister, Mary, a Business School 
graduate, Lemmer has been selling what he calls “Italian 
ice” since childhood, after spending summers in New Jersey 
where the treat was rife. 

The idea to peddle it around Lansing, their hometown, 

came when the Italian-American duo’s father bought them 
a cart in 2004. They began selling their product anywhere 
they could afford the entrance fee: carnivals, fairs, farmer’s 
markets, etc. After the two gained some traction, people 
started asking where they could indulge in ice year-round. 
By the time Lemmer was a sophomore, he was beginning to 
form an answer to that question.

“Mary had networked herself really well in the business 

school,” Lemmer said. “She had met a building owner down-
town — this building — and they had an open spot — this spot 
— and he said, ‘I know you guys are doing Lansing, but do you 
want to try it in Ann Arbor?’ Knowing nothing, not knowing 
what our first step would be, we were like, ‘Yeah, sure. Why 
not?’”

Following a lot of trial and error, Iorio’s Gelateria officially 

opened up in 2011. The process wasn’t all smooth sailing, 
though. They failed their first city inspection the day before 

opening because one grease trap was misplaced.

“That was kind of the hardest thing that happened, just 

facing the reality that we actually might not open. One thing 
I have learned is that hiring really good people to start, and 
spending time on that, really helps because we’ve always had 
a really good team. And that just makes everything easier,” 
Lemmer said.

Steir and Mayer of Salads UP on East Liberty faced similar 

issues with the technicalities of opening up their business.

“We signed the lease without realizing the deficiencies of 

the space to their fullest,” Mayer said. “As we went on we 
realized — we ended up having to do completely new plumb-
ing, electric. We put in a brand new floor. The construction 
requirements for such a small space were something we 
never want to deal with again. But getting through that pro-
cess — which took six to eight months — was very compli-
cated.”

Mayer, a northern New Jersey native, and Steir, a native of 

New York City, met each other as freshman year roommates. 
For the 24-year-olds, the idea for Salads UP sparked early on, 
as they felt a great salad place (a la NYC’s Revive) was miss-
ing during their time at the University. 

It all started to come to fruition late senior year, when 

Mayer began hunting for local real estate, toying around 
with the idea of a restaurant. The two met to discuss it, and 
Steir jumped in from there. Salads UP came to be in Decem-
ber 2014.

Steir cites his Business school education in giving him 

business-minded versatility. 

“They’re kind of preparing you without realizing it, in my 

opinion, to run your own company, if you digest all of the 
coursework that you have there,” Steir said. “There’s finance 
— it might set you up to be a banker. There’s marketing if you 
want to be in advertisement. But you do everything when you 
run a company, no matter if it’s a restaurant or something 
else.”

Lemmer also recalls a tidbit of info, gleaned in college, 

which now eases his shop’s customer experience.

“I was sitting in an engineering ergonomics class, and we 

were talking about eyesight, like how big text should be,” 
Lemmer said. “The rule is called the Bond Rule, like James 
Bond — 007. It’s a ratio, of sorts; it’s how big the text has to 
be on the wall as to how far you’re standing away, where you 
can comfortably read it.”

He proudly gestured to the menu on the wall.
“When I was designing that menu, I was like, ‘Oh my god. 

I learned about this engineering class,’” Lemmer said.

All three entrepreneurs admit they owe much of their 

success to the charm and benefits of living on their college 
campus.

“The nicest thing about being here, despite that fact that 

it’s a university we went to, is that it’s this nice mix of calm, 
quaint, but also vibrant at times,” Steir said. 

“People care so much about this community that we’re all 

so connected to. When you’re alumni, you’re connected to 
this place for life, whether you have a business here or not. 
So to be in the midst of it is fantastic.”

Mayer echoes similar sentiments of home.
“It’s very comfortable, I would say. Having been here for 

four years, you know the neighborhood so well,” Mayer said. 
“Whether it’s game day or move-in or graduation, there’s 
always something happening, a lot of flow and excitement. I 
think living here post-college you still feed off a lot of that.”

Lemmer revels at being so close to students — a perk other 

businesses in non-college towns are denied.

“There’s a few things that we do here that we’ve actually 

taken from a semester-long project from a marketing class, a 
consulting group, an operations class. There were graduate 
students doing inventory operations for us — it’s hysterical. 
And for free,” Lemmer said.

So for those who wish to follow in the footsteps of Ann 

Arbor’s young entrepreneurs, he offers one bit of advice.

“I would say just to do it,” Lemmer said. “I couldn’t tell you 

how many people come to me with an idea, or have an idea, 
and then they just sit on it. I’m the dumb one — the crazy one 
— that’ll come up with an idea and just do it.”

Personal Statement: A plea for common courtesy

by Sylvanna Gross, Daily Sports Writer

“E

xcuse me, my food is cold.”

Ma’am, that’s because you decided to finish 

your conversation before touching your food.

“It’s chilly in here, could you turn down the A/C?”
No, I don’t know how and I really don’t have time. But don’t 

worry, in five minutes I will come back and let you know that 
I did.

“Well, why don’t you have any soy-free, vegan, gluten-free 

products that are organic and are under 100 calories?”

Well, sir, you are describing air. And unfortunately I don’t 

know how to ring that up and give you a bill for that. I suggest 
water, it’s free.

***

There’s an old adage that goes, “You can choose two out 

of the three things for college: a social life, good grades, and/
or sleep.” But, when you have a job in college, you can really 
only choose one because having a part-time job in college is 
hard. Like, super hard. And, if you choose to have a full-time 
job and go through your undergrad career, I respect you on 
so many levels.

Yet, despite having no time to do everything I need to do, I 

somehow get by. I get decent grades, I maintain a somewhat 
regular social life — though I miss a lot of great events — and 
my classes don’t start until 11 a.m. every day, so I usually get 
at least six hours of sleep.

I’ve always had minimum-wage jobs since I got my work-

ing papers. It gave me a sense of independence from my 
parents. I learned the value of money, the necessity of sav-
ings, etc. And, to be honest, I have learned just as much from 
working minimum-wage jobs as I have sitting in classes. I’ve 
learned time management and I’ve learned how to pour wine 
in a fancy way and I’ve learned to tie my hair up in a knot so 
that it won’t move for hours on end.

But the number one thing I have ever learned from work-

ing all through high school and college is the value of com-
mon courtesy.

Silly, I know, to complain of manners in an age where hav-

ing a face-to-face conversation is rare and a common greet-
ing between friends is an insult. But I will still complain 
because, truthfully, people have forgotten the art of respect.

It is one thing to be rude to your friends, but it is quite 

another to be rude to someone you don’t know.

I am your waitress. I am there to make your dining expe-

rience as pleasant as possible. I understand that sometimes 
the food is not to your liking but remember: I AM NOT THE 
CHEF. I am simply the messenger between you two. I have 
no control over when food will be ready, despite how often 
I can annoy the kitchen. Trust me, you are not the only per-
son unhappy if the food isn’t right. I am too, because that 
means that even though I did my job right, someone else did 
it wrong. But I will be the one to pay for it when you decide 
what to tip me.

Sometimes people’s wallets don’t allow them to tip over 

15 percent and I completely understand that. However, I 
believe you should be budgeting what you plan to spend that 
night with your waitstaff in mind. I make three dollars an 
hour legally because the restaurant believes that because I 
am making tips, my salary will then be adjusted. However, 
when I have ten tables undertip me or ten patrons forget to 
tip me or ten customers who are only doing takeout so why 
should they tip me for spending hours looking over the menu 
with them, I can sometimes not even come close to making 
$9 an hour.

And when you work ten-hour shifts constantly standing, 

$9 an hour is not right.

So that’s my first request from diners: don’t base your tip 

on how your food tastes, base your tip on how much I try 
to make the dining experience as wonderful as possible. I 
promise you, I’m not smiling and making small talk for my 
own benefit.

And under no circumstances do you choose not to tip. 

Because that happens, too, and I guarantee the waitstaff will 

remember your face.

Another frustrating habit: the kid situation. I will preface 

this by saying that I love children, but please take control of 
their actions in a restaurant. I am carrying hot food, cups 
filled to the brim with liquid, and knives. Your child should 
not be under my feet when I finally get to your table. Your 
child should not be blocking every possible available surface 
with their toys. Also, your baby is screaming? Take them 
outside. Your toddler is throwing a tantrum? Take them out-
side. You want to chastise your pre-teen? Take them outside.

If we close at midnight, do not walk in at 11:55 p.m. and 

think it’s OK.

There is nothing worse than walking up to a table to take 

your food order and having to wait for the patrons to finish 
their conversation. Acknowledge my presence! Please!

When you are ready to order, put the menu down to signal 

me to come over. When you are ready to pay the check, put it 
at the side of the table.

Don’t hit on me.
If you’re dining with a large group, tell me at the begin-

ning if you want separate checks.

With that being said, as a college student myself, I get 

wanting to go out with your friends. But if all eighteen of 
you are each ordering one $5 item and you all want separate 
checks and you’re all not willing to tip, I will have issues.

Smile.
If you have questions about the food, I will answer them. 

However, there comes a point where I need to do other 
things besides spending five minutes detailing every single 
item on the menu.

I can quite literally go on for hours with requests. But 

please, do me a favor (or really do yourselves a favor) and 
next time you sit down at a restaurant, remember me. I am 
your waitress and this is my job, but I am a person. And I 
deserve basic common courtesy.

Ladd also cited the need for housing affordable to the workforce, but 

said she thought costs were going up commensurate with national trends 
and the local population.

“We’ve always been pretty prosperous in Ann Arbor,” she said. “The 

standards of living and I think the earning capacity of people that live 
in Ann Arbor has very much increased and so that has an effect on the 
prosperity of downtown. I don’t think we’re pricing people out downtown.”

Finding a balance
When it comes down to the policy on how to create that affordable 

housing and how cost of living increases should be treated overall, the 
issue has been contentious for years.

At a Council retreat for strategic planning in 2012, former Ann Arbor 

Mayor John Hieftje said the city had become gentrified, according to 
MLive.

“I’ve seen the city gentrified from the time that I’ve been here,” Hieftje 

said. “It’s less affordable now, and I think that’s something we can’t ever 
forget. We have to continue to work in that area. We can’t forget that we 
need to make it possible for others to live here who may not have the best 
of jobs.”

A year later, at another retreat, multiple members of Council raised 

concerns about cost of living, and affordable housing was also an oft-
mentioned topic of discussion in the 2014 Council and mayoral races. Most 
recently, in the 2015 Council elections, it resurfaced as a focus for multiple 
candidates.

Krapohl, who was elected in 2014, said he thought keeping housing 

affordable downtown would continue to be an ongoing issue for Council.

“I just don’t see how we’re going to get around it,” he said. “Because 

it’s an issue that affects multiple income levels within the city and our 
residents. And we have a relatively diverse economic group here and for 
the health of a city, the health and growth of any city you need to maintain 
that. And a big part of that is having affordable housing.”

So far, he said, it’s been hard to find a policy to promote affordable 

housing that had a long-term impact.

In many ways, Briere said, City Council is limited in what it can and 

can’t do.

The state doesn’t allow the city to mandate building sizes, or require 

that developers building downtown also build affordable housing. Nor 
is funding generally available to increase housing downtown through a 
government effort.

“The reason the Council hasn’t moved forward is it doesn’t have 

sufficient revenue itself to put aside many, many millions of dollars to 
build and then support enough housing for young workers, for retirees, for 
people who are earning but who aren’t able to afford to live in Ann Arbor,” 
she said. “Being able to provide housing for people who are living in public 
housing is pretty much the maximum we can do, at least today. It’s a source 
of frustration, and I don’t have an answer. If I did, I’d be promoting that 
answer.”

Beyond the numbers, discussing the changing face of downtown also 

raises another series of concerns — what it means for the character of the 
city.

“The fear that the people have who want the community to be stable 

rather than growing significantly is that not only will the charm that 
Ann Arbor possesses disappear, but also that the sudden growth will be 
followed by shrinkage,” Briere said. “And all of the changes will occur 
and then the new buildings will become derelict, the old houses will be 
abandoned, because the change is not sustainable.”

Others, she noted, think that change is what builds the city’s character, 

creating two ideas about the city’s future with vastly different outcomes.

Overall, Krapohl said there’s no easy answer to what the balance should 

be between growth downtown and cost of living, or how to to mitigate 
unintended effects that might come from it.

However, he noted that the solution might lie in a new approach to 

looking at the issue — thinking of development of the downtown, and 
development of the neighborhoods around it as a single concept, not ones 
at opposition.

“It’s a nice thing with some of the new development, new building,” 

Krapohl said. “It strengthens the city center. To me the city is like a wagon 
wheel, and the downtown area is like the wagon hub, and you have to have 
a strong hub for the spokes of the neighborhood going out. I think there’s a 
lot of discussion at times, the development of the downtown at the expense 
of the neighborhoods, that to me I think they have to go together.”
