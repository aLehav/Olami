Members of
Students of Color
of Rackham discuss
issue at meeting
By ROBBIE AUSTIN
For the Daily
The issue of racial profiling
in University crime alerts took
center stage at a University
town hall meeting on Friday.
University students and Ann
Arbor residents gathered at the
University Law School to dis-
cuss the relation of safety, cam-
pus climate and diversity on
campus. The event - chaired by
Rackham student David Green,
the political action chair of
Students of Color of Rackham
- focused on racism and social
justice at the University, with
an emphasis on racial profiling.
One of the key issues dis-
cussed was the use of racial
descriptions in the University's
Department of Public Safety
crime alerts. Of the 22 crime
alerts released by DPS between
Jan. 1, 2011 and Nov. 9, 2011, 12
incidents occurred off campus
and nine took place on cam-

pus, according to data released
by DPS. Of these 22 alerts, 11
specifically identified the skin
color of the suspect as white,
five as black, one as darker
skinned, one as hispanic, one as
tan, one as olive and two had no
raceinformation.
Philosophy Prof. Elizabeth
Anderson said information
about race is not needed in
crime alerts because it doesn't
add any information to the
description.
"There is no value added
in the description (of race),"
Anderson said. "It reinforces
the legitimacy of spreading ste-
reotypes and damages the rep-
utation of black men."
The speakers argued that
racial descriptors apply to
broad groups of people on cam-
pus and therefore generate fear
of these groups. Anderson said
innocent people fitting the
racial description are negative-
ly impacted by the wording in
DPS alerts.
University alum Walter Lacy
and Rackham student Gbenga
Olumolade, an e-board liaison
for SCOR, described their per-
sonal experiences with what
they regarded as racial profil-

CHAMPAIGN - J.T.
Floyd took one last look
around Memorial Sta-
dium.
The stands were quickly
emptying. Michigan center
David Molk was standing at the
midfield block 'I,' posing with
Illinois center Graham Pocic, a
former high school teammate.
As Floyd started crossingthe
turf toward the tunnel to the
visitor's locker room, he saw Illi-
nois wide receiver A.J. Jenkins
approaching him. The receiver-
cornerback duo hadbattled all
game long.

Floyd pulled up at the goal
line.
"Heck
of a game,
man," Floyd
told the All-
American
wideout. "I
think you're
a heck of a
talent."
Jenkins, STEPHEN J.
in his orange NESBITT
No. 8 jersey,
gave a big
smile and tossed the same com-
pliment back at Floyd - Michi-

gan's No. 8.
"Make sure you go get the
rest of the (defensive backs) and
give them some trouble the rest
of the season," Floyd said as he
stepped away.
He tucked the winged helmet
under his left arm and trotted
through the north endzone and
into the tunnel.
Beneath the dreadlocks,
just below the eye black, Floyd
couldn't contain his smile. He
was still beaming as he climbed
onto the team bus a half hour
later.
He went man-to-man against

the best receiver in the Big Ten
on the road and won. Not only
did No.22 Michigan beat Illi-
nois, 31-14, but Floyd sealed the
victory with a fourth-quarter
interception.
"Coming into the game and
into this week, I knew A.J.
Jenkins was a great receiver,"
Floyd said. "His stats speak for
his skills. He's top-10 in almost
every category in the nation. So
I knew it was a big week for me."
He gave another grin.
"And he's number 8, too, so
took that kind of personal."

Fifth annual
luncheon honors
anniversary of
Kristallnacht
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
Fryda Fleish was only 12
years old when the Germans
invaded Chrzanow, Poland in
1927.
For three years, Fleish was
separated from her family and
placed in a concentration camp.
When she was finally freed, she
was one of few surviving mem-
bers of her nearly 60-person
extended family.
Fleish was one of 50 Holo-
caust survivors who shared
their experiences with students
and visitors at the University
of Michigan Hillel yesterday.
The 5th annual Conference on
the Holocaust was held in com-
memoration of the anniversary
week of Kristallnacht - "the

night of broken glass" - which
occurred on Nov. 9, 1938, when
Hitler ordered the Nazis to
persecute Jewish people and
destroy all their property.
LSA junior Shana Sternberg,
chair of the event, said more
students may have attended the
event than in the past because
it occurred in the fall semester
rather than the winter semes-
ter when many students are
studying abroad.
"We had alot of non-Jewish
students that came, which was
one of our goals because we
don't want to just target the
Jewish community, but expand
to everyone since a lot of people
who died during the Holocaust
were not Jewish," Sternberg
said. "We want to spread the
message never to forget this
awful event and to educate peo-
ple through their stories."
Sternberg said the lun-
cheon was especially powerful
because the participants could
interact directly with the survi-
vors, who sat with small groups

Daily Staff Reporter
For a group of mice in Dr.
Andrew Campbell's lab, the
pain caused by sickle cell
anemia just started to go
away.
Campbell, a pediatrician
and director of the Pediatric
Comprehensive Sickle Cell
Program at the University's
Cancer Center, is the lead
author of a study published
last month that is the first to
use specific proteins in the
human body to prevent sickle
cell disease.
Sickle cell anemia is a
hereditary disease of the
blood, which causes red
bloods cells to form in an
abnormal crescent moon
shape, instead of the normal
disk shape. These sickle-

Facebook founder Mark
Zuckerberg returned to Har-
vard University - the school he
dropped out of when he started
developing Facebook - last
Monday to recruit new employ-
ees for his company, according
to a Nov. 8 Associated Press
article.
Wearing a sweatshirt and
jeans, Zuckerberg held a press
conference outside of Lamont
Library surrounded by students
and the public, the AP report-
ed. He spoke about the future
of Facebook and his plans for
expanding the company and

can be rethought," Zuckerberg
told the audience, according to
the AP.

Lacey told the audience he
was pointed out by the police
for stealing something that had
recently been reported miss-
ing. According to Lacey, he was
detained by police for 45 min-
utes though he had not stolen
anything. Lacey said he felt "a
lack of respect" in the situation.
Olumolade also described a
situation in which he was ques-
tioned by DPS officers because
he broadly fit the description of
a suspect in a crime alert.
DPS Chief Greg O'Dell then

addressed the crowd and point-
ed out that the University must
adhere to federal requirements
when issuing crime alerts. The
guidelines mandate the inclu-
sion of "all information that
would promote safety and that
would aid the prevention of
similar crimes," the guidelines
state.
DPS also issues alerts for
incidents that have occurred in
areas of the Ann Arbor Police
Department's jurisdiction near
campus.
Another attendee of the
meeting asked about a DPS
crime alert in which a suspect
was described as having dread-
locks or being bald. O'Dell

responded, "Would it be the
right decision to put out noth-
ing even though the descrip-
tions are conflicting?"
According to O'Dell, DPS has
to include all information about
a case - race included.
However, O'Dell pointed out
that AAPD has policies to pro-
hibit racial profiling, including
writing, physical and psycho-
logical tests which are admin-
istered to prospective officers.

CHARLES DHARAPAK/AP
U.S. President Barack Obama, right, and Peruvian President Ollanta Humala leave the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
Summit in Kapolei, Hamaii yesterday.
Oba-ma calls for Pacific
free tradepa by 2012

Trade zone will
increase U.S. exports,
create new jobs
HONOLULU (AP) - Pacific
Rim leaders gathered for an annu-
al summit in Hawaii pledged Sat-
urday to work together to keep
world growth on track, as Presi-
dent Barack Obama announced
the broad outlines of a plan he said
could serve as a model for a trans-
Pacific free trade zone.
"There are still plenty of details
to work out, but we are confident
that we can do so. So we've direct-
ed our teams to finalize this agree-
ment in the coming year," Obama
said while seated beside leaders
of eight other nations involved in
the negotiations toward setting up
what has been dubbed the Trans-
Pacific Partnership.
"It is an ambitious goal, but we
are optimistic that we can get it
done," he said.
The trade zone can serve as
a model for the region and for
other trade pacts, increasing U.S.
exports and helping to create
jobs, a top priority, in the fastest
growing region in the world, said
Obama, who made promoting the
so-called TPP a priority in hosting'

this week's summit in his home-
town, Honolulu.
Much of the work by Obama
and other leaders at the summit
of the 21-member Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum is
aimed at fostering freer trade and
closer cooperation to help fend off
recession as Europe struggles to
resolve its debt crisis.
"We have an enormous respon-
sibility for supporting the wider
world, a responsibility that no one
nation could seek to carry alone
- it can only be borne if we stand
shoulder-to-shoulder," Malaysian
Prime Minister Najib Razak said
in remarks to be delivered later
Saturday at the East West Center,
a Honolulu think tank.
By removing barriers and bot-
tlenecks that slow business, APEC
members hope to re-energize
growth at a time when the world
economy most needs dynamism
in the Asia-Pacific region to offset
the malaise spreading from crisis-
stricken Europe. At the same time
they are workingtoward a broader
agreement, countries are continu-
ing to forge separate free-trade
deals.
The U.S. recently clinched long-
sought free trade pacts with South
Korea, Colombia, and Panama
- agreements that if ratified will
t

bring to 20 the number of coun-
tries that have free trade agree-
mentswith the U.S.
On Friday, Vietnam and Chile
signed a free trade agreement on
the sidelines of the APEC meet-
ings that will further boost the
already thriving trade between
the two in Chilean copper and
steel and Vietnamese garments,
rice and coffee.
The outline for the free trade
pact announced by Obama and
other leaders pledges to work
toward eliminating tariffs and
other barriers to trade and invest-
ment, facilitating trade and other
business, harmonizing regulatory
standards, aiding small and medi-
um-size companies and contrib-
uting to development and poverty
relief.
Japan, the world's third-larg-
est economy, has also signaled it
wants to join the negotiations on
the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
and the Obama administration
hopes other nations will be wooed
as well.
But China, which some econo-
mists say is on course to over-
take the U.S. as the world's
biggest economy this decade, has
appeared lukewarm about the
Pacific trade pact, describing it as
"overly ambitious."

Always speak up
Moral responsibility should come before football
tragic scandal was exposed at Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity last week. Jerry Sandusky, former assistant football
coach for the Nittany Lions, was accused of sexually abus-
ing young boys, which allegedly occurred on Penn State's campus.
His alleged crimes are by far the most shocking aspect of the situa-
tion, but the silence of many high-ranking coaches and administra-
tors who knew about the abuse is unacceptable.


Pretty much, the defense bailed me out:'
- University head football coach Brady Hake said about Saturday's game
against Illinois, as reported by The Michigan Daily Saturday.
Our two health care markets

As humans, we have a moral responsibil-
ity to protect children and report suspected or
confirmed crimes, regardless of if the action
personally affects us. In light of the horrific
event, universities across the country - includ-
ing the University of Michigan - must ensure
they are fostering an environment in which
good morals come before all other priorities.
Graduate student assistant Mike
McQueary witnessed Sandusky raping a
10-year-old boy and reported what he saw
to the university's head football coach Joe
Paterno. Paterno was fired - effective imme-
diately - by the university's Board of Trust-
ees last Wednesday and McQueary was
placed on an indefinite administrative leave.
Penn State University President Graham B.
Spanier - one of the longest serving presi-
dents in the country - was also fired by the
board.
As the leader of Penn State's football pro-
gram and prominent figure at the university
for 46 years, Paterno had an obligation to
report these crimes and ensure an investiga-
tion topk place. He failed to do so. McQueary
had a duty to react immediately to the crime
he witnessed by helping the child and involv-
ing the police. He also failed to do so. While
it has been claimed that both individuals did
what was minimally required of them in the
eyes of the law - the incident was reported
by both to their boss - in situations of abuse
against innocent children, the legal minimum
is simply not enough. Sandusky's victims and
any victims of child abuse deserve better.

College athletics have come to a peculiar
status at universities. As sports bring in more
money and fans become more invested in the
success of their schools, a strange culture
begins to form. There are all kinds of legal
violations that have been found to be taking
place in college sports, and there is an incli-
nation to address them internally for the sake
of the university and its brand. The negative
reaction to Paterno's firing is a testament to
the impervious nature of this culture and
how much people will ignore for the great-
ness of their school.
Every university, government body and
business needs to foster an environment in
which people feel safe - safe among their
co-workers, safe in the workplace and safe
to come forward with information, regard-
less of what it involves. College football
programs cannot be exempt from the rules.
Despite the vast amount of money football
brings in at many large universities and the
power successful coaches hold, the programs
and people within them must be held to the
same standards as any other department on
campus.
The horrible situation at Penn State
remained a secret for nearly a decade
because of the program's power and the fear
that disclosing the information could harm
that status. But from the moment children
were harmed, this issue was no longer about
football and was instead about basic human-
ity. We all have a responsibility to be people
first and fans second.

hhe health care reform bill
that was passed last year
means that Michigan,
like all states,
is required to
set up some-
thing called a ,
"health insur-
ance exchange."
This past week,
the state Sen-
ate passed a NEILL
bill to begin
the process of MOHAIAD"
developing that
exchange, which
is a fancy way to describe a web-
site where people without health
insurance can shop for coverage. In
response, Scott Hagerstrom, head
of a statewide organization called
"Americans for Prosperity of Michi-
gan," likened the bill to a "declara-
tion of war on the Tea Party."
That's insane. The word "insane"
is a hallmark of lazy writing, but
sometimes simplicity is important.
"Insane" is the only word that
adequately describes Hagerstrom's
position. In order to understand
why, however, you have to also
understand something about how
health insurance works in the
United States.
There are two health care markets
in this country: One for everyone
who is offered a health insurance
policy by their employer and one for
everyone else. If you're fortunate
enough to have a job, and luckier
still to have a job that provides ben-
efits, then there are three separate
decisions that determine what sort
of care you will ultimately receive
when you need it. First, health insur-
ance companies negotiate with phy-
sicians and hospitals to determine
which providers will be in their
benefit network. Second, employers
negotiate with insurers and choose
one of them to provide coverage to

their employees. Third, individual
employees will sometimes have the
ability to choose between differ-
ent kinds and amounts of coverage,
albeit only from whatever insurance
company their employer has already
signed a contract with.
What's important to keep in mind
is that "choice" in the American sys-
tem is largely illusory even though
our system relies onthe private mar-
ket to a much larger degree than do
most other wealthy countries. The
market for insurance is dominated
in most states by only a few firms,
meaning they can act as a cartel and
impose prices for coverage that are
higher than they would otherwise
be. Employers can try to pick the
cheapest insurer from that limited
set of options, but that means chang-
ing which doctors their employees
are allowed to see.
As bad as all of that is, life in the
other group is even worse. If you're
self-employed, or work multiple
part-time jobs that don't provide
health benefits, then you're faced
with two dismal options. One is to
buy coverage "at retail" from insur-
ance companies. However, the
insurance companiesknow that peo-
ple who are unemployed or working
the sort of labor-intensive job that
doesn't come with benefits are likely
to be less healthy than other people,
meaning that coverage under these
circumstances is much more expen-
sive than it would otherwise be.
The other option is to pay out
of your own pocket for expenses
as they arise. What you may not
realize, however, is that everyone
- from your pharmacist to your
doctor to your hospital - actually
has two sets of prices that describe
everything they do. One figure is
what they bill to insurance com-
panies, with whom they've already
agreed on a set list of prices. The
other is the "list price" that they

charge to anyone without insur-
ance. This second price is much
higher - 10 times higher or more
- because most patients who are
charged the list price are too poor
to ever pay anyway. Hospitals gam-
ble that once in 100 times they'll
catch someone who doesn't have
coverage but does have a steady
paycheck, and by gouging those
patients they can make back some
of their expense in treating the
poorest of the poor. If you ever hap-
pen to meet this description, you
are extremely likely to go bankrupt.
Both options are
dominated by a
few companies.
The exchanges are meant to
help this second group, if only very
slightly, by introducing competi-
tion that makes their health care
market less broken. I don't think it
will work, though the reasons why
are a separate column. If nothing
else, it is the sort of market-based,
pro-small business proposal that
the likes of Hagerstrom should find
thrilling. It's also a reform that is
needed more in our state than any-
where else. With such high unem-
ployment, Michiganders are more
likely than most Americans to find
themselves in the broken market I
described above.
So where did Hagerstrom find a
"declaration of war" in all of this?
Not in the proposal itself, so it must
be in the name of the president who
helped design it. There's a word for
that sort of reaction: insane.

Like Penn State, we need a
community of caring'
TO THE DAILY:
Dear University Community:
At some point in our adult lives, most of
us learn how to respond to anger with love,
to violence with peace and to ignorance with
education.
As you may know, Pennsylvania State Uni-
versity is dealing with very painful issues
regarding alleged child sexual abuse.
Many ofus, some ofus with histories of trau-
ma and abuse, are reacting to what appears to
be endless reports of graphic violence to chil-
dren. Media reports and stories and headlines
are not simply information. They can become
triggers and reminders for us - personally and
for people we know.
The students at Penn State declared last
Saturday's game against Nebraska to be the
first official "Blue Out" (as distinct from the
usual "White Out") in support of child abuse
awareness. (Blue ribbons are a symbol of child
abuse prevention). This student response and
'U' mandated Relationship
iemix program is a joke

decision was wonderful to see and can become
a needed antidote, as well as one step toward
healing. We should be inspired by numerous
Penn State faculty, staff and students who are
respondingpositively to this.
I urge all of us to do our own "community
of caring" - take time to talk with others, edu-
cate ourselves, reflect on the meaning of all
these events, check in with each other and sup-
port each other. For those who have suffered
from childhood sexual abuse, please know that
reaching out to others and seeking professional
counseling helps.
Through these actions, we can together
respond with action, with knowledge, with
peace and with voice.
Please remember to utilize our U-M
resources:

of encouraging students to cultivate strong,
healthy relationships without the need for
sex, it condones sexuality as an essential facet
of a relationship. When I walked into the pro-
gram, I was greeted by a table piled high with
flavored condoms, female condoms, oral-sex
protection and a wooden penis. Honestly?
As long as our culture continues to condone
sexual freedom, sexual assaults will remain
a permanent fixture of society. Until men and
women begin to respect each other's sexu-
ality and recognize sex as a great gift that
should be protected and honored, money will
continue to be wasted on programs like Rela-
tionship Remix and freshmen like myself
will be left to question the moral compass of
the University we have chosen to attend.

A requiem for hu-man dignity


Don't feel sorry for Joe Paterno.
Don't feel sorry for a man who is a legend in his sport.
He has the all-time record for wins for a Division-I coach,
which was set in the last game he coached. He can "take
his leave" now with a record, given the state of Division-I
football's coaching carousel that probably will never be
broken. How's that for timing?
Don't feel bad for Graham Spanier. The former Penn
State University president participated in a cover-up of
one of the most egregious scandals possible and the sex-
ual assault of multiple young boys. All because he wanted
to maintain his status within JoePa's Grand Experiment
- that a school can be a football power and still maintain
high academic and moral standards that have been flail-
ing at such flagship schools as the University of Southern
California, Auburn University, the University of Tennes-
see and that school down South.
Feel bad for the Board of Trustees at Penn State. This
board did one of the bravest things possible and did not
let a disgraced coach control his fate due to his name -
unlike how the Ohio State University President E. Gor-
don Gee joked about The Vest during TattooGate. This
board took astep in the right direction and thought about
the future of the university first, the football program
second. In fact, this board followed JoePa's tenets bet-
ter than JoePa did. This board showed its commitment
to Penn State as a university, something of which Penn
State should be proud.
Feel bad for the players at Penn State. They came to
that university on the promise of gaining quality educa-
tions in both football and in life, learning from one of the
most enduring men of our time. Now, all that they were
promised was revealed to be false. They were learning
morals from a man who did what he was bound to do by
the law, but not what he was bound to do by the morals
that he claimed to profess. For many of the seniors on
the team, a higher percentage at Penn State than other
schools, last Saturday was their final home game. They
were supposed to bask in the glow of having a powerful
sendoff by their friends, family and fans. Now they had
to play under the shadow of Paterno's dark secrets. They
went onto the field knowing that it is the first time in

more than 50 years that JoePa would not be coaching at
Penn State. They are amongthose who will suffer.
Feel sorry forthe Penn State community. They are the
ones who will be picking up the pieces of this scandal. *
They are the ones who, day in and day out, will have to
deal with the aftermath of Penn State losing a multitude
of its leading voices and proponents. They are the ones
who will have to deal with recreating Penn State as a
wonderful place to be. They are the ones who will have
to deal with making Happy Valley a truly happy commu-
nity. They are the ones who have their work cut out for *
them in the years to come.
Feel the most sorry for those poor boys who suffered
sexual abuse at the hands of a trusted adult, coach and
friend. Sexual abuse is not an insignificant topic. The
deep running emotional scars are beyond the com-
prehension of any who have not suffered this kind of
abuse. The abuse goes beyond the mental problems
associated with rape. Sexual abuse like that which
occurred with these boys involves betrayal at a deeper
level - a betrayal that could greatly impair their ability
to trust anybody in the future, out of fear thatthey may
be betrayed as such again. Sexual abuse victims have
to live with the pain and relive the horrors every night
- knowing that the adults that they counted on to pro-
tect them cared more for themselves than the fate of an
innocent child. Betrayal such as this will hinder these
boys' ability to live.
Lastly, feel sorry for yourself.
Be sorry that you live in a world where even the most
wholesome of institutions have problems such as sexual *
assault and rape waiting in the wings.
Be sorry that scandals such as this force you to ques-
tion the integrity of the institutions that you know, love
and even attend.
Be sorry that you live in a world where people only
care about a series of sexual abuses because it involves a
football coach - not because there were sexual abuses at
a university. And that is the greatest shame of all.
God, what a world we live in.
Nirbhay Jain is anS LSA freshman.

TO THE DAILY:
Last Wednesday, I spent two painfully long
hours listening to presenters from Sexual
Assault Prevention and Awareness Center
speak about the importance of consent before
a sexual encounter, knowing one's personal
values and identifying dangerous sexual situa-
Oons. This new program, deemed Relationship
kemix by the University, is now required for all
freshmen to attend as mandated by University
President Mary Sue Coleman.
Although I recognize how prevalent sexu-
al assaults and other non-consensual sexual
encounters are on this campus, the Remix
program is inherently flawed in that instead

Clinton: Iran must

weapons report
Iran must respond soon to a
report by the U.N. atomic agen-

secretly on developing a nuclear
weapon, U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton said Friday while
attending a Pacific Rim summit.
Clinton said she discussed
the issue with her counterparts
gathered in Hawaii who also
expressed serious concern over
the issue.
"Iran has a long history of
deception and denial regard-
ing its nuclear program and in
the coming days we expect Iran
to answer the serious questions
raised by this report," Clinton
told reporters.
"The U.S. will continue to con-

next steps we can take to increase
pressure on Iran," Clinton said.
The International Atomic

to 35 nations earlier Friday in
Vienna as it sought to underpin
its case that Iran apparently is
working secretly on developing a
nuclear weapon.

Floyd was up late on Friday
night. Inside the team hotel, he
kept the reel rolling, watching
Jenkins torch cornerback after
cornerback. To a man, he'll admit
he's no match for Jenkins. But he
caught something in the film - a
split, atendency.
There were certain situations,
depending on the score, down
and spot of the ball, that Jenkins
and quarterback Nathan Scheel-
haase got predictable. Third
down on Michigan's 40-yard line
was one of those situations.
When the pass went up, so did
Floyd.
"The coachesawere talking to
me telling me, 'Just trust your
instincts,"' Floyd said. "I just read
it. I seen the receiver raise up in
his break, and Itjust went for it"
He returned the interception
43 yards to set up the Wolver-
ines' final score.
Jenkins finished with eight
catches for 103 yards, but Floyd
was resilient. He kept Jenkins
out of the endzone.

gan's 67-65 triple-overtime thrill-

the Diag, included a World War
II veterans panel, film screen-
ings of "Lioness" and "Taking
Chance," a care package collec-
tion drive for those currently
serving and a discussion on post-
traumatic stress disorder.
The symposium started off
with a panel led by student vet-
erans in the Union's Kuenzel
Room. LSA senior Ryan Pavel,
president of the University's
chapter of Student Veterans of
America, said during the panel
- which he facilitated - that he
believes it is importanteto discuss
the challenges student veterans
face.
There are approximately 400
student veterans on campus,
according to Pavel. The Univer-
sity's SVA chapter was founded
in the spring of 2007, and sup-
port for veterans on campus has
grown over the past few years,
he said.
"Since then, there has been a
few people who have been con-

team.
In an interview before the
game, Glen Ashlock, a vet-
eran and the Navy basketball
team captain, explained that
the rules of wheelchair basket-
ball are the same as NBA rules
with the exception of dribbling
- the ball must be dribbled in
between every two pushes of the
wheelchair. Despite the label as
a wheelchair basketball game,
only four of the players use
wheelchairs in their daily life.
Checking is OK according to
Ashlock, "but there's a line," he

said. Ashlock also explained that
basketball wheelchairs are engi-
neered differently than regular
wheelchairs. Basketball wheel-
chairs have wider angled wheels
and metal bars onthe bottom that
help protectplayers' legs and feet.
While the Navy team had

commanded the flow of the game
from start to finish.
The 2010 Michigan team got
punched and fell flat. These Wol-
verines get punched and they
punch back.
Last season, with 110th-
ranked defense in the nation,
Michigan couldn't stopa nose-
bleed. That defense just wasn't
good enough to win.
"That's all you heard about
when I took the job here," said
Michigan coach Brady Hoke.
This season, usingthe same
cogs and a few well-oiled addi-
tions, Hoke and defensive coor-
dinator Greg Mattison have
a defensive machine on their
hands.
So what happened? How is
Michigan winning on defense?
Floyd knows the answer and
doesn't mind sharing. Twice, he
credited the coachingstaff for
putting him in the right position
to make a play. Twice more, he
admitted his newfound dedica-
tion to film.
That difference comes from
Hoke and his staff - they have
the Wolverines prepared to play
every Saturday.
It's the toughness Hoke
preaches. It's demanding every
week that nobody's job is certain.
It's accountability.
And it has Michigan back on
the map.
sistently lobbying for increased
support (of veterans)," Pavel
said. "Now I would say that (the
University) is getting ... increas-
ingly veteran friendly."
The panel featured eight stu-
dent veterans who spoke about
their experiences at the Uni-
versity. LSA junior Brendan
Lejeune, a student veteran, said
that he considers the University
a very "veteran-friendly place."
He said the support of SVA
helped ease his transition into
academic life.
"I was 25 when I came here,
and in some of my classes the
kids were 18, and our life experi-
ences were just night and day,"
Lejeune said. "Having other vets
near me made it feel like I was
more a part of the University."
Other panelists pointed out
that veterans constitute only a
small part of the student body.
LSA sophomore Andrew Floyd
said he feels there is a relatively
small number of student veter-
ans on campus and said he only
sees fellow veterans at SVA func-
tions.
"I would definitely like to see
more veterans in classes," Floyd
momentum in the beginning -
scoring three times in the first
three minutes - the Army team
put up a fight to make it a close
game. The Navy ended up win-
ning by a mere two points with a
final score of 36-34.
Engineering freshman Jim
Rasche, a U.S. Navy veteran, said
he rested up in preparation for
the game. He added that learn-
ing how to play basketball in a
wheelchair is like "learning to
walk again." Rasche attributed
the Navy's lead in the beginning
of the game to good shooting and
luck and said he had no expec-
tations for the outcome of the
game.

"The main point is it's all about
honoring and bringing attention
to veterans," Rasche said.
Army basketball team captain
Jerry Sarasin, also a veteran, has
played wheelchair basketball for
the last 20 years and said he's
gotten good at the game.
"For the first time we've ever

"The past is somethingthat's
always goingto be in the back of
your head," said senior captain
Mike Martin. "We don't focus on
it because we're so much differ-
ent as a team, as a defense. Guys
are so much better, our mentality
is just so much better, and I'm
sure that it showed on the field
today."
Allowing just over two touch-
downs a game - at sixth in the
nation in scoring defense - these
players finally know the feeling
of a job well done.
But the transition in the past
season hasn't been easy. Ask
Floyd. Hoke and Mattison admit
they've been hard on Floyd all
season. He's notejust No. 8, he's
the team's No. 1 cornerback.
"Coaches are always tough on
me, but that's why I came here,"
Floyd said. "I came in to win
and win big. The coaches did a
good job to get me prepared each
week, make sure I'm focused,
makingsure I'm keying in on
what I need to key in on."
So when Floyd turned away
from Jenkins at the goal line and
looked around again. He was the

said. "Certainly I think (veter-
ans) enrich the learning environ-
ment."
Business graduate student
Lindsay Compton, a student
veteran, agreed that veterans
enhance the classroom setting.
During the panel, Compton said
she brings her experience in the
armed forces to class by provid-
ing examples of leadership, disci-
pline and teamwork.
"Our classmates have really
great experience in the consult-
ing world, or as accountants or
whatever they may have done,
but it's amazing the depth and
breadth that we (veterans) can
give with our experience,"
Compton said.
Compton added that it's chal-
lenging but rewarding for stu-
dent veterans to share these
experiences with their civilian
peers.
"I think sometimes it's a little
bit harder to open your mouth
and share that because our expe-
riences are a lot more intimate
and a lot more challenging, but
I think our classmates really
appreciate our perspectives,"
Compton said.
played together, (we're) really
good," Sarasin said of the team.
While Sarasin was involved
in many of the rough wheelchair
collisions on the court, he said
the event was more about pro-
moting awareness and having
fun than anything else.
"If it wasn't for the veterans,
there wouldn't be wheelchair
basketball," Sarasin said.
Event coordinator Gerald
Hoff, a University insurance ver-
ification representative, said the
event is popular among student
veterans.
"Student veterans met with me
after last year's game and asked
that if I could please have another

Army-Navy game," Hoff said.
Hoff organized the event with
the help of volunteers, including
members of the University ser-
vice group Circle K, who passed
out free snacks and drinks dur-
ing the event. Hoff said he hopes
to move the event to Crisler
Arena in the future.

at roundtables to better facilitate
discussion.
"It is an entirely different
experience hearing their per-
sonal stories and to see the way
they tell theem," Sternberg said.
"Some of the people we bring in
are teachers, authors - people
who really want to share their
stories."
While Fleish said it is difficult
to share stories of the atrocities
she endured, she believes it is
important to move forward.
"The dreams are there, and
you can't make them go away,"
Fleish said. "It lives inside of me.
You never get over it. It is a part
of you, always in the back of your
head."
At another table sat 83-year-
old Anton Opengeym, who spoke
of his troubled life running from
the war. Because his family was
wealthy, the Nazis targeted his
father and brother, who were
among the first in the town to be
killed.
"They like to take everything
you have - your weaknesses,"
Opengeym said.
After the war, Opengeym fled
communist Latvia with his wife
and children - hoping to give
them a better life. He came to
Michigan and worked as the
custodian for The Birmingham
Temple in Farmington Hills for
26 years until he retired.
"God Bless America," Openg-
eym said with a smile on his face.
"I started with nothing, and now
I have Social Security."
Opengeym said even though
his life was not as prosperous as

when he was a child, survival is
the only thing that is important
to him.
"Sometimes you just need to
have a bad life to know what a
good life is, and I have a really
good life now," Opengeym said.
Holocaust survivor Henia
Ciesla Lewin lived in the ghettos
of Kielce, Poland and then fled to
the woods for nine months with
her sister and aunt, where she
witnessed the murders of fellow
hiding refugees. After return-
ing to the ghettos, she was sent
to five different concentration
camps, including Auschwitz,
before being freed by the U.S.
Army.
"I remember when Hitler
came into the town, and I felt the
hostility all around him," Lewin
said. "It still rings in my ears."
Lewin said that now her
life goal is to share her stories
so people can understand and
stop the hatred that caused the
Holocaust. She wrote a poem in
remembrance of her mother for
her grandchildren that she likes
to share.
"My mother begged me,
before we separated, that her
only wish was for me to survive,"
Lewin said. "I think her wish
kept me alive. Someone had to be
there to tell the stories."
When asked how she could
continue to be optimistic after
living through such horrific
events, Lewin explained thatshe
had to rise above her oppressive
past to foster a future that tran-
scends the hatred of the Holo-
caust.
"I hope and I pray that a time
like that will never come again,"
Lewinsaid. "I am full of so much
pain, but I don't hate anybody."


RESEARCH

than normal red blood cells and
deliver less oxygen to tissues in
the body. Deprivation of oxygen
to tissues can often cause organ
damage and lead to death.
According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Preven-
tion, 90,000 to 100,000 Ameri-
cans have sickle cell anemia.
The disease, which is identified
by a lower than normal fetal
hemoglobin count, is prevalent
in Africa and found in about
one out of 500 African-Ameri-
can babies born.
In the study, Campbell suc-
cessfully increased fetal hemo-
globin levels in mice with sickle
cells. Increasing the production
of TR2 and TR4 proteins has the
potential to prevent and reduce
organ damage. Similar results
were seen when the study was
conducted on mice with trans-
planted human genes.
Campbell said that increased
fetal hemoglobin directly cor-
relates with decreased disease
mortality rates.
"Those who have higher
fetal hemoglobin levels associ-
ate with significant decrease in
death and definitely in morbid-
ity and complications," Camp-
bell said.
Currently there is only one
drug, Hydroxyurea - which is
also used in cancer treatments
- that is FDA approved to
increase fetal hemoglobin lev-
els in sickle cell patients. How-

ever, the side effects of the drug
are not well known.
Campbell said the study will
allow an alternative method to
treat the disease that might be
more favorable.
"There's a lot of intoler-
ance in some patients in taking
(Hydroxyurea)," Campbell said.
"... They need other options, so
we're just discovering another
protein. This is a protein, and
it's in the body."
The study was a collabora-
tive effort by different Univer-
sity departments, Campbell
said. Osamu Tanabe, a research
assistant professor of cell and
developmental biology, and
James Engel, a cell and devel-
opmental biology professor
and department chair, were co-
authors and contributors to the
study.
In 2007, Tanabe first devel-
oped the gene that caused the
over-expression of TR2 and
TR4 proteins and proposed the
study on mice to Campbell.
Now, the researchers will
begin to translate these find-
ings into a treatment safe for
humans. Tanabe said it could
take a long time, but the next
step is to find a way to cause the
same effects seen in the mice
by increasing the activation of
TR2 and TR4 receptors, which
may lead pharmacological
researchers to develop a drug
that can do this.
"(I think) our findings
may lead to a new therapeu-
tic approach for the disease,"
Tanabe said.

create mobile
applications
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily StaffReporter
Sleep-deprived, burgeon-
ing entrepreneurs in the Ann
Arbor area convened yesterday
to put the finishing touches on
start-up endeav-
ors as part of a v k
three-day event
focused on the
development of o
innovative busi-
ness models.
This week-
end, North Quad Residence Hall
and the University TechArb
hosted Hacka2thon, an event
for programmers and entrepre-
neurs, in which about 45 Uni-
versity students and Ann Arbor
residents teamed up to execute
entrepreneurial projects, par-
ticularly on new digital media
platforms. The participants had
only 36 hours - Friday after-
noon to Sunday afternoon - to
complete their projects.
University alum Scott Goci,
the event organizer, said he
came up with the idea because
he wanted to create an event
that emphasized Ann Arbor's
innovation, hence the "a2" in
the name.
"I really wanted this event
to be about pushing entrepre-
neurship from Ann Arbor," Goci
said. "I don't want the next big
company to come from Silicon
Valley. I want it to come from
Ann Arbor."
Hacka2thon was sponsored

by several technology power-
houses such as Microsoft, the
University's Center for Entre-
preneurship, Ann-Arbor based
software development company
Menlo Innovations and API
company Twilio Cloud Commu-
nications.
Goci said he modeled Hack-
a2thon off Startup Weekend
- an entrepreneurship event
hosted in different cities around
the world. The first ever Start-
up Weekend in Ann Arbor was
hosted at the University in Jan-
uary with more than 125 par-
ticipants.
Since Startup Weekend hap-
pens only once a year, Goci said
he wanted to give local residents
additional opportunities to
attend entrepreneurial events.
Goci hopes Hacka2thon will be
held two or three times a year so
people have various opportuni-
ties to attend events that foster
innovative creation.
Engineering sophomore
Miguel Sanchez and his team
won the award for best mobile
application. They created a
social map for Ann Arbor to
highlight event and party loca-
tions on a city map. Sanchez said
he had never participated in a
hackathon before but would like
to do it again.
Another Hacka2thon par-
ticipant, LSA senior Adam
Rice, won best application for
Goosecast - an application
through which users can blog
live events by creating an event
link and automatically upload-
ing pictures and other content
for users to view. Rice said he
eventually would like to run
the non-technical aspects of
a business, and he attended
Hacka2thon to meet people
and gain experience in building

applications.
"I really believe in what wg
have," Rice said of the product
his team created. "It's a really
cool product. I mean, people in
here were loving it. They were
using it in here already."
School of Information stu-
dent Gierad Laput was part of
the group Si-Chi, which created
a program that he described as
a mix between a task list and
Doodle - a web application that
allows groups of people to coor-
dinate schedules. Laput said
the purpose of the project is to
provide teachers with a tool td
track students' progress as thej
fill out online checklists provide
ed by the instructor.
Laput added that he had nevet
participated in a hackathos
before but would love to par,
ticipate in the future because of
what he learned about the start
up process and teamwork.
Michigan resident Min
Chan, who works for a company
that develops applications tha
help people learn Chinese, sai4
she attended Hacka2thon fo
the experience of working on
a start-up in a short period o
time.
"I really like the concept of
taking something from develop-
ment all the way to completion
in three days," Chan said. "That
way we can show ourselves that
we can do something really
fast."
Chan said Ann Arbor's Hack-
athon was unique from other'
she has been to because there
was a focus on entrepreneur-
ship asopposed to justprogram-
ming, which she said created a
more enjoyable atmosphere.
"It's a supportive environ-
ment rather than a competitiv4
one," she said.

'J. Edgar' cleans up

Long live 'Immortals'

Weighty script
doesn't bring down
Eastwood effort
By AKSHAY SETH
Daily Arts Writer
What drives an ostensibly
paranoid and resentful little
man to become the most power-
ful individual
in the world?
More interest-
ing still, under J. Edgar
what pretense
of morality does At Qualityl6
this man choose and Rave

power? These Warner Bros.
are the seem-
ingly broad questions, as complex
at their core as they are meaning-
ful in scope, tackled in "J. Edgar,"
the biopic about the controversial
former head of the FBI.
Morality is a word thrown
around a lot in this movie.
And in a curious sort of way, J.
Edgar Hoover's interpretation
of the term is as flawed as the
film itself. One of those flaws
is the convoluted nature of the
script, which spans nearly seven
decades, jumping between the
latter parts of Hoover's life and
the FBI's formative years.
Traversing back and forth
from the '30s to the late '60s, the
audience gets a rather muted
but believable interpretation of
the two cases that vaulted the.
fledgling agency to nationwide
prominence: the execution of
John Dillinger and the capture
of Bruno Hauptmann, the man
charged with kidnapping and kill-

DIRECTOR INTERVIEW

TV/NE W MEDIA COlUMN
What late night's lacking

'Electric Car'
director discusses
auto industry story
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Arts Writer
Not many people have a vision
wide enough to encompass the
entire auto industry. Even while
the Big Three are bouncing back,
a worldwide recession and a gov-
ernment bailout have left that
vision as muddled as ever. For
the people of Michigan - a state
whose identity and livelihood
are welded to the Motor City -
such uncertainty could shake the
confidence one has in the future.
With just a quick glance at
the posters and displays outside
the screening of "Revenge of the
Electric Car," it becomes evident
that writer-director Chris Paine
stands among those he chroni-
cles - individuals with the fore-
sight to plan for a sustainable
future. Not only did his first film,
"Who Killed the Electric Car?"
reveal and clarify the forces that
caused the electric car to fail, but
it also documented the direc-
tions the auto industry might
take. It was an ambitious film
with simple roots.
"In 1996, I leased an elec-
tric car (the EVi) from Gen-
eral Motors, and it changed my
thinking about cars," Paine said
in an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily.
After driving that car for five
years, its production was discon-
tinued and he wondered why.
"I wanted to make a film about
why electric cars were such a
great technology," Paine said.
"Along the way we sort of stum-
bled into this bigger story of why
the car was stopped."

But following the release of
"Who Killed," there seemed to
be a revolution: The electric car
was revived.
"GM went bankrupt and the
auto industry was reduced to
bailouts, and at one point, I think
even a CEO of a car company
went to Washington D.C. driving
in an electric car," he recalled.
"That was quite a turnaround."
Change was finally happen-
ing, and thus "Revenge" was ,
born. Whereas the first film
was concerned with what was
happening inside the industry,
Pain explains that "Revenge" is
"about character and overcom-
ing challenges ... how the inside
changes."
In other words, this film
chronicles the individuals who
will in effect govern the future
of the auto industry, and by
extension, the future of Michi-
gan. Paine believes that the hub
of 21st century auto technology
innovation - and future jobs -
could be located in Michigan.

But this story isn't over.
"The electric car touches on
so many issues, if you wanted
to do a film on this today, it'd be
like six hours," Paine said, as if
to acknowledge where "Who
Killed" and "Revenge" might fall
short. But his films are meant
to inspire interest in the topic,
not postulate on every facet the
industry and its future.
"It was better to get people
to try these things and have the
experience for themselves (rath-
er) than try to make a big dia-
tribe about why the government
messed up," he said.
So will Paine dive back into the
electric car story?
"If I find another angel inves-
tor that wants to support another
project, then I might do another
one," he said.
Then, with a smile, he added,
"But there will be many more
stories, whether they're written
by people like you or other film-
makers or television people. The
electric car story is just starting."

MICHIGAN 31, ILLINOIS 14

Redshirt sophomore running back Fitzgerald Toussaint has run for 420 yards over the past three games since he became Michigan's lead back, averaging 6.6 yards per rush.

Toussaint runs for a
career-high 192 yards,
defense dominates
By KEVIN RAFTERY
DailySportsEditor
CHAMPAIGN - Illinois entered Sat-
urday's game against Michigan ranked
No. 1 in the Big Ten in rush defense,
giving up an average of just 103 yards
per game.

The Fighting Illini (2-4 Big Ten, 6-4
overall) featured the nation's sack and
forced fumbles leader in defensive end
Whitney Mercilus, who had terrorized
opposing offenses with a combination
of speed and strength up front.
But on Saturday, the 22nd-ranked
Wolverines (4-2, 8-2) tamed Mercilus
and the Illinois defense, as redshirt
sophomore running back Fitzgerald
Toussaint rushed for a career-high 192
yards en route to a 31-14 Michigan vic-
tory.
"Up front is where we executed
well." Toussaint said. "The offensive

line, I give them credit for creating
creases, allowing me to go through
them and explode."
Less than two minutes into the game,
Michigah nearly met Illinois' average,
as the Wolverines scored on the open-
ing drive, going 80 yards on four rush-
es, including a 65-yarder by Toussaint.
On 2nd-and-10 from the 20-yard
line, junior quarterback Denard Rob-
inson took the snap in the shotgun and
handed the ball left to Toussaint, whose
eyes widened.
"It was open," Toussaint said. "It was
a huge hole. I just saw daylight. Coach

always says run to daylight, and that's
what I did."
Toussaint burst through the hole,
past Mercilus. From there, it was a foot
race to the end zone between Toussaint
and the Illinois secondary.
He made it to the Fighting Illini
15-yard line before finally being brought
down by cornerback Tavon Wilson.
"I was just running," Toussaint said,
smiling. "I was looking to score."
Two plays later, Michigan did score
on a nine-yard scamper by Robinson to
give the Wolverines an early 7-0 lead.
"It was great to see our offense go

down the field and score," said Michi-
gan coach Brady Hoke. "It helps your
team, helps your morale.
"I thought we blocked pretty well
early. I thought Fitz really helped us.
He was running the ball very well."
But Michigan's rushing onslaught
didn't end. Toussaint, who said the
holes were the biggest he'd seen this
year, continued to dominate on the
ground, racking up an astonishing 121
yards on nine carries in the firstquarter
- not far off from his previous career
high of 170 yards, set two weeks ago

Mattison finally admits the
return of a 'Michigan defense'

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
CHAMPAIGN - Greg Mattison, the
man who had said his defense would
never play good enough for him - the
man who said perfection was what he
strived for - he was near tears.
He was also the same man who always
said he'd admired how eager his guys
were to learn. Now, his brow furrowed
and his heart poured out of his mouth.
"That was a Michigan defense," Mat-
tison said like a proud father figure,
admitting it for the first time all season.
"They played as hard as they could, they
did whatever they had to do. Without a
doubt, that was a Michigan defense."
The Michigan football team had just
won the game on defense, holding Illi-
nois to 30 yards, including minus-14
first-half rushingyards, before ultimate-
ly allowing 14 points and just 214 yards
of offense en route to a 31-14 victory on
the road.
"They're Michigan Men," said an
emotional Mattison. "We talk about it
all the time, that there's a standard at
Michigan and you've got to live up to
that, and you're judged by it. We haven't

CHAMPAIGN - On a whiteboard
in an Illinois team meeting room, some
leftover remnants of the team's prepa-
ration for the Michigan football team
remained. There were two groups of
circles, lined up in the I-formation.
One group was labeled "is," the other
"2s." In blue dry erase marker, the
Fighting Illini had written "16" next to

the quarterback spot in the"ls" and "7"
under the "2s."

the most accurate description of "7,'

Hoke's secret is leading with his seniors

One week before the big-
gest game of his life, Rick
Kelly broke his leg. The
senior defensive end's Yorktown
Tiger football career was cut
short before
he had the
chance to
finally beat
crosstown
rival Delta, , .
who had'
dominated
the series in
recent years. TIM
The year ROHAN
was 1983 and
Brady Hoke
was just starting his coaching
career at the small Indiana high
school as the Tigers' linebackers'
coach.
Thatyear,in what could be con-
sidered a minor miracle, the farm
boys from Yorktown beat the city
slickers from Delta, 13-12. After
the game, Hoke was charged with
handing out the game ball, which
could've gone to the star running
back or Hoke's star pupil line-
backer - and both deservedly so.
"I know we're happy," Hoke
began as he stood in front of the
whole team. "But we've got one
person in the hospital who didn't
get to enjoy this. He's going to
enjoy it.
"This is his!" Hoke shouted,
holding the game ball high.
The Tigers erupted. They
thought Kelly would eventu-
ally get the ball, but once they
all boarded the team bus Hoke


directed it immediately toward
the hospital, the players still
sporting their jerseys and pads.
Hoke and a few players
marched up the hospital stairs
and handed the ball to Kelly.
Nearly 30 years later, Michigan
coach Brady Hoke still coaches for
his seniors.
His unwavering message:
"We're always going to play and
coach for our seniors."
You heard it after Michigan lost
against Michigan State. And after
the Wolverines disappointed and
tripped against Iowa. And after
each game, as the season culmi-
nates. Each time the message is
strong because it plays on the
heartstrings - time is precious.
It's all about the seniors. And it
makes sense.
Hoke's belief is a program is
only as strong as the seniors who
lead it. Your best players should be
the upperclassmen who are older,
stronger and more mature. They
know how to handle themselves
and prepare off the field. They
know the traditions. Then, when
the time comes, they can share
their knowledge of work ethic
and tradition with the freshmen.
The cycle continues. A winning
tradition breeds more winning.
But what do you do when you
inherit a senior class that has
known nothing but late-season
disappointment since it stepped
on campus? With this Michigan
team, Hoke had to win them over
first, which wasn't too hard. With
their clock ticking, the seniors

"I like how they like each
other," Hoke said two weeks
ago, after his team beat Purdue.
"Maybe that's corny or whatever,
but from where I sit, I've liked
that they respect each other and
they want to play for each other,
in my opinion. It shows."
The system is set up for suc-
cess - the underclassmen want
to prove themselves; the upper-
classmen want to leave a mark.
Accountability matters.
These seniors decided to go
the extra mile to change the sta-
tus quo of recent years, and they
were rewarded Saturday with
their eighth win this season -
the most for a Michigan team
since 2007.
Maybe they'll finish with eight
wins. Maybe nine. Maybe 10.
Maybe they'll get a chance at 11,
if they're lucky. But what should
make Hoke smile is how Martin
and Van Bergen took over the Illi-
nois game on defense. His seniors
led and everyone else followed.
"It shows that what you've been
doing, this is how it pays off," Van
Bergen said. "This is how things
will happen for you if this is how
hard you work.
"I think that's a great message
to the younger guys too. I'm gone
next year but the legacy - if you
do this in the offseason and you
work this hard, this will be how
successful you are."

19-0 run fuels'M'in season opener Michigan looks
By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
TI hfor answers after

the Michigan basketball team's
season opener against Ferris
State.
The Wol- FERRIS STATE 33
verines MICHIGAN 59
were hot
and cold throughout the contest
on Friday evening. But luckily for
Michigan, it ended on a 19-0 run
to relax away the pain of a shaky
first 30 minutes of play in a 59-33
victory.
"It started on defense, first
of all," said redshirt sophomore
center Jordan Morgan about the
spurt. "We got a lot of steals and
got some easy shots and when we
started getting those easy lay-
ups, whether it be in the full court
or the half court, we got a rhythm
and then shots started to fall for
us - the same shots we couldn't
get to fall in the first half."
The 18th-ranked Wolverines
(1-0) were led by the two players
who went scoreless in last week's
exhibition game against Wayne
State. Sophomore forward Evan
Smotrycz and senior guard Stu
Douglass both scored 14 points
and were on the mark from
3-point range to help seal the win.
In addition to shooting 3-for-4 on
3-pointers, Smotrycz also demon-
strated his strength by finishing
two lay-ups while getting fouled.
A day after Michigan coach
John Beilein announced that
freshman Trey Burke would
start over Douglass, Burke was
benched at the start of the game
because he was late to the team's
walkthrough on Friday. The
move to start Douglass had oppo-
site effects on the two guards.

two-game sweep

S r - n s ts -hl-sots30-4 o 4e t a
Sophomore forward Evan Smotrycz scored 14 points while shooting 3-of-4 from beyond the arc.

Douglass was quick in transi-
tion and shot the ball with con-
fidence, finishing 5-for-10 from
the floor with a team-high four
assists. Meanwhile, Burke strug-
gled to get into the flow of the
game, making just one of seven
shots and failing to record an
assist in 18 minutes.
"One of the things that I really
want Stu to do is think like a two-
guard instead of always running
the team," Beilein said. "You can
see we need to score points, and
I have not been comfortable with
Stu not scoring points. So we're
trying to create opportunities
for them and if that means he's in
with Trey or that he comes off the
bench, it gives him more opportu-
nities to score some points."
Beilein said that while he
believes Burke's tardiness was a
one-time incident, he has yet to
decide who will start Monday's
game against Towson.
Much like last week's exhibi-

tion, Michigan struggled to find
offense throughout much of the
game. The Wolverines relied on
3-point shooting to keep them out
of the Bulldogs' reach, but failed
to score from in close. While
Michigan was effective in getting
into the lane in the early going, it
converted on just three shots in
the paint in the first half - the big
men were largely uninvolved. The
result of penetration was mainly a
kick-out for a 3-point attempt.
"I think we went 1-for-12 after
we went 3-for-3," Beilein said.
"That's when you've got to take it
to the basket, you've got to throw
the ball inside. You can't be afraid
to back-cut, and you've got to get
to the foul line."
Sophomore center Jon Horford
started but didn't even attempt
a shot and pulled down three
rebounds in 18 minutes. Morgan,
who replaced him, was also a
non-factor in Michigan's attack
until the spurt late in the game

when he scored back-to-back field
goals.
"They're just having trouble
right now finishing in crowds,
and we've got to get that part of
our offense really going," Beilein
said. "Both of them are playing a
little tentative, and that's some-
thing that we have to work on as
coaches."
With 8:50 remaining in the
game, the Wolverines held a 38-32
lead and Ferris State had the
momentum with a 9-3 run. But
Smotrycz's 3-pointer, followed by
a second-chance basket by junior
Matt Vogrich put the Wolverines
on a streak which culminated
in Douglass's 3-pointer to give
Michigan a 25-point advantage
with three minutes to play.
"We didn't want to win by 10,"
Smotrycz said. "We wanted to
get everyone in the game. We felt
like we should be winning by a lot
more and shots weren't dropping,.
but we stuck with it."

shootout didn't really matter.

disappointment even if Miami

shootout
attempt into a spinning whirl-
wind of a shot that sealed the loss
for the Michigan hockey team.
Getting the two-point shoot-
out win wouldn't have changed
much because even that extra
point couldn't have saved the
weekend for the Wolverines.
No. 5 Michigan (3-3-2 CCHA,
7-3-2 overall) traveled to Oxford
and played its worst series of the
year, dropping both games to
a Miami team that hadn't won
a CCHA game until last week.
The most concerning thing for
the Wolverines wasn't the loss-
es, but rather not knowing what
caused them.
"I don't know (what we are
missing)," said junior forward
A.J. Treais. "We just needto find
it. We are struggling right now."
That search for "it" wasn't
much of a question on Friday
night because the Wolverines
continued their season-long,
Friday-nightstruggles.
The RedHawks (3-4-1, 5-6-
1) scored less than two minutes
into the first period, putting
Michigan in a hole it could not
climb out of. The Wolverines
were dominated physically from
the moment the puck dropped.
"I don't know if it was a lack of
focus todayor what,but we didn't
come out like we needed to," said
senior forwardLuke Glendening.
"We struggled because of it."
All weekend the Wolverines
had serious troubles hanging
onto the puck in Miami's zone,
which led to a lot of turnovers
and missed opportunities. They
were able to erase a two-goal
deficit in the final period when
Glendening dug a puck out of the
corner and finished on a great
feed fromjuniordefenseman Lee
Moffie to give his team a fighting
chance with 13 minutes left.
But Michigan couldn't get a
second goal. The team finally
showed signs of life late, but that
slow start was too much to over-
come.

The answers after Saturday
were a lot harder to come by.
This time it wasn't a slow start,
as junior forward Chris Brown
gave Michigan an early 1-0 lead.
It also wasn't a lack of hustle.
The first tally was set up by a
great effort play from Treais,
who disrupted the setup of a
RedHawk play deep in their
zone to give Brown a great look
at the net. It also wasn't for a lack
of bounces. Michigan tied the
game with four minutes left on a
spectacular goal from freshman
forward Zach Hyman. Hyman
took a pass behind Miami's net
and sent off an odd lookingshot/
pass to the crease. The puck then
bounced off the skate of Miami
goaltender Cody Reichard and
just barely made it in the net.
The RedHawks also had two
goals called back on Saturday,
and a shot in the first overtime
period missed ending the game
by a couple inches.
"We just need *
to find it. We
are struggling
right now."

"TheseteamsintheCCHAare
really good teams," said Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson. "We
are no better than anyone we
play. We have proven that."
But opinions as to Michigan's
struggles differ throughout the
locker room. Senior goaltender
Shawn Hunwick cited the team's
lack of experience and also ques-
tionedthe Wolverines' mentality.
"Maybe you go through the
week, you might think, 'Hey
we're Michigan, we're just going
to come out and play, and it's
going to be easy', but it's not,' "
Hunwicksaid. "It's alessonwe're
learning real soon. You can say
whatever you want, guys can talk
in the locker room, but unless
you go out and do it, it's all talk."
Whatever the true issue is,
after a disappointing week-
end, Michigan returns home

Courtney Boylan had the
game of her career on Friday.
The senior guard scored a
career-high 21 points and posted
a team-
high seven MICHIGAN 69
rebounds FLORIDA 66
en route to
a 69-66 season-opening win for
the Michigan women's basket-
ball team over Florida.
With 27 seconds left, Boylan
hit a layup and was fouled to put
the Wolverines up by four. She
sunk the free throw and iced the
game for Michigan.
Even though Boylan had
almost a third of the Wolver-
ines' points, the rest of the team
had key roles in the win. Senior
forward Carmen Reynolds and
junior forward Rachel Sheffer
both scored in double figures,
posting 15 and 13 points, respec-
tively. Junior guard Jenny Ryan
and freshman guard Nicole
Elmblad both came up big on
the boards, combining for 13
rebounds and helping the Wol-
verines outrebound the Gators
42-36.
"That was a big surprise,"
Reynolds said. "Coach told us
to outrebound them because
we know they're the leading
rebounding team in the South-
eastern Conference, and we did
that"
Though the Wolverines
looked better on the stat sheet,
the game was close the entire
way. Michigan's largest lead
was six points, and there were
29 lead changes. Michigan (1-0
overall) shot 49 percent from the
field and hit a couple of key shots

near the end of the game to pull
out a victory on the road.
"We knew at the beginning of
the game it would be possession-
by-possession," said Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth. "I think
these guys did a great job of
being strong whenthey had to."
The Wolverines' biggest
strength was their presence in
the paint, led by Sheffer, Reyn-
olds and Elmblad. Michigan
racked up an impressive 32
points down low, compared to
Florida's 18.
Reynolds said the team's pen-
etration in the lane, in addition
to its post game, was what con-
tributed to the huge numbers
in the paint. Boylan agreed and
said she believes that the pres-
ence in the paint will really help
them during the Big Ten season.

"(Getting the ball in the paint)
was a huge focus of the game,"
Reynolds said. "Get it into Shef-
fer, get it into whatever player
is crashing into the. paint, and
being able to do that was key.
"As coach always says, 'when-
ever you get into the paint, big
things happen.' So that was huge
for today's game.".
With Florida forced to stop
Michigan's post game, the Wol-
verines were able to shoot from
outside, hitting 47 percent of
their 3-pointers. Junior forward
Kate Thompson and Reynolds
hit key 3-pointers down the
stretch to give the lead back to
the Wolverines before Boylan
converted the three-point play
to seal the game.
Though the Wolverines
played an all-around solid game,

they weren't without faults.
Michigan committed 18 turn-
overs, which led to 15 Florida
points. Boylan said taking care
of the ball is something the team
needs to continue to work on.
Boylan also believes the Wol-
verine defense could've been
better throughout the game,
but she's confident that it's
something the team will keep
improving.
"It is a big win for us," Boylan
said. "It's really important to
remember that we're obviously
taking it one game at a time, but
it's always nice to be 1-0 and get
that first win.
"It's a great confidence boost-
er knowing we can go on the
road, play an SEC team, and
have the game be close and come
out with a win."

GARDNER
From Page lB
Last week against Iowa, Gard-
ner struggled filling in for injured
junior quarterback Denard Rob-
inson. He hesitated to throw, then
hesitated to run. When he did take
off, he ran into defenders. Gardner
threw a first down pass too high
and chucked an underhanded ball
to the sideline as he was getting
sacked, which led to an intentional
grounding call.
Robinson eventually came back
into the game to lead a last-minute
drive.
Saturday, Gardner didn't see
the field early. The "Deuce" for-
mation, which was featured sev-
eral times since the game against
the Golden Gophers, had Gard-
ner at quarterback and Robinson
as a back or split out wide. With
both playing at the same time and
Gardner taking the snap,it created
a sense of Robinson as quarter-
back IA and Gardner as 1B. Borges
didn'tcall the formation the entire
game against the Fighting Illini.
But when Robinson bruised his
wrist and left the game, Gardner
didn't disappoint in backup duty
this time.
Coming in with about 10 min-
utes left in the third quarter, he
instantly led a drive that resulted
in a field goal. The highlight came
when Gardner rolled out to his
right and hitfifth-year senior wide
receiver Junior Hemingway inthe
hands coming across the field.
"My coaches always say if one
person goes down, you got to step
up and do the same as he was
doing," said senior wide receiver
Martavious Odoms. "That's what
he did."
The numbers weren't impres-
sive: 2-for-5 passing for 47 yards
and a touchdown, two rushes for
nine yards. But it only took one
play for Gardner to show everyone
his potential.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
said after the game that Robinson
could have returned late. But in a
10-point game early in the fourth
quarter, Hoke sent Gardner trot-
ting back onto the field. On 3rd-
and-15, Gardner dropped back,
feelingpressure fromthe edge. He
stepped up in the pocket.
- "We forced the quarterback to
step up, just like it was designed,"
said Illinois defensive coordinator
Vic Koenning. "Our fourth rusher
should have been right there."
Instead the rusher was playing
off the line of scrimmage. As he
challenged Gardner, the quarter-
back didn't hesitate this time. He
stepped to throw and hit Odoms,
who had come open between the
safeties, in the chest. Odoms trot-
ted into the end zone untouched.
"That's a great play," Hoke said.
"I think he played as well as I've
seen him play."
Robinson will be the starting
quarterback next week. There is
no guarantee that the "Deuce"
formation will reappear. But on
Saturday, Gardner proved to be a
weapon, making believers out of
the Fighting Illini.
"He's a stronger guy, not quite
as elusive but he did get away
from us, unbelievably so," Koen-
ning said. "It just looked like he
ran right through arm tackles."

against Purdue.
After the Wolverines'
defense forced the Fighting
Illini's third-straight punt,
redshirt sophomore receiver
Jeremy Gallon gave the Wol-
verines great field position
after he took freshman Justin
DuVernois's punt 32 yards to
the Illinois 41-yard line.
Michigan stuck with the
ground game on the ensuing
possession, going 41 yards on
seven running plays - finished
by a two-yard rush by Robin-
son to make it 14-0 Michigan
early in the second quarter.
Toussaint continued to
excel, gaining 22 more yards on
the scoring drive and finishing
the first half with 144 yards on
18 rushes.
Meanwhile, the Michigan
defense continued to stunt the
Illinois offense, giving up just
one first down in the first half,
allowing the offense to have
plenty of time to further its
rushing dominance.
Dominance in the ground
game, that is, until the Fight-
ing Illini seemed to figure out
MICHIGAN DEFENSE
From Page 1B
get back to playing "Michigan
football."
They knew what that meant.
In the first three days of fall
camp, Mattison put on a clin-
ic about what it meant to play
Michigan defense. He installed
just two defenses in three days,
making sure he had time to set
his expectations.
"All we talked about was
defensive philosophy - 'This is
what we do. This is who we are,"'
Van Bergen said. "'We haven't
been that, we will be that.' So far,
it's held true. We've been as dom-
inant as he's said we could be."
The defense has improved in
every way possible this season,
and the road win in Champaign
served as the crowning achieve-
ment in Mattison's turnaround
effort. The numbers say they
allow 20 fewer points per game
(15.5) and 132 fewer yards (317)
than last season.
And as the offense sputtered
and turned the ball over three
times againstIllinois,the defense
was dominant. The goals they
set for themselves during camp
became more than just expecta-
tions. They became reality.
"We wanted to hold our offen-
sive opponent to 33 percent or

what they needed to do to stop
Toussaint and the onslaught of
run plays.
"The blitz was hurting us
in that it seemed like we were
getting up field, and we didn't
make the tackle," said Illi-
nois defensive coordinator Vic
Koenning. "So once you create
a vertical seam, you don't make
the tackle, we were running
right by them.
"We weren't making plays,
and we went back to just kind
of trying to stay in our gaps and
playing base and that seemed
to help us, but we got our butt
beat."
The change in strategy
worked.
After Michigan took over at
the Illinois 43-yard line with
three minutes to go in the half,
Toussaint gained just three
yards on three rushes during a
seven-play, 22-yard drive.
The Wolverines were forced
to attempt a 38-yard field goal,
but redshirt sophomore kicker
Brendan Gibbons missed it
wide left.
After a sizzling start offen-
sively, Michigan went into the
half with a 14-0 lead after gain-
ing just one net rushing yard in
the second quarter.
less on third downs, which we've
done a pretty good job of that,"
Van Bergen said.
Michigan stopped the Fight-
ing Illini on their first eight third
down attempts, and Illinois fin-
ished 5-of-17 - or 29 percent.
"Short yardage situations, we
wanted to win all those - we do
that," Van Bergen continued.
Illinois was 1-for-5 on short
yardage situations on third or
fourth down. And the Wolver-
ines forced seven three-and-
outs, including three straight to
start the game.
"Red-zone defense has to be
great," Van Bergen said. "We've
been good at that. Turnovers
(too)."
Illinois converted both of its
red-zone trips into touchdowns,
but that was after the game was
well in hand. And the defense
picked off Illinois quarterback
Nathan Scheelhaase to ice the
game and forced running back
Jason Ford to fumble, only one
play after Michigan's offense
failed to score in the red zone
itself.
"Pretty much, the defense
bailed me out," said Hoke, who
had called for his offense to go
for it on 4th-and-1. But failed.

defense bailed me out" - were

ple-overtime shootout win. Van
Bergen remembered it hurt most
that the defense wasn't consid-
ered "reliable." The offense had
to bail the defense out.
On Saturday, Michigan's
defense proved it could play well
on the road. It proved it could
win a game its offense couldn't
put away. It proved that it could
prevent a team from crossing
midfield for an entire half.
"You should think we're a
dominant defense that can be
relied on," Van Bergen said after
the game. "You should think that
the defense is a staple of Michi-
gan right now and that's what's
going to continue at Michigan.
Michigan will always be able to
rely on its defense. It always has
been and it always will be that
way."
And the defensive line will
always lead the defense, Hoke
has decreed. Van Bergen had 2.5
sacks. His friend, senior defen-
sive tackle Mike Martin, had a
half sack and nine tackles, dis-
rupting any and all of Illinois's
intentions of running the football
all game.
Illinois averages nearly 200
yards rushing per game. It fin-
ished with 37.

staple of the "Michigan defense."
It's hard to argue with results as
the buzzwords that Mattison and
Hoke preached have become the
group's identity.
"I think when you stop the
run, it starts there," Hoke said.
"I think when you play with a
physicalness. I think when you
see those maize helmets hitting

the ball carrier multiple times. I
think that's Michigan defense."
It sounds like the stuff of fairy
tales, but the sight of it nearly
reduced a grown man, Mattison,
to tears.
"For a lot of years, Michi-
gan was known for Michigan's
defense," Hoke said. "They really
want to represent that."

FITZGERALD TOUSSAINT:
Remember, no 'i' before the double
as.' You're going to be hearing his
name a lot over the next two or
three years. Michigan has its lead
running back. Toussaint ran for a.
career-high 192 yards on 27 carries
against the Fighting Illini. More
impressively, the first 121 yarda
came on his first nine carries.
Touaaaint credited his offensive
line when they were opening up
huge holes, but since Michigan's
bye week after the Michigan State
game, Toussaint has just seemed
different. The speed is there to go
along with some added shiftiness.
Toussaint only mentioned that he
felt healthier after the bye week.
But fans don't question why, they
just take delight in the fact that
offensive coordinator Al Borges
has finally found the running back
he's wanted since the beginning.

FIFTH-YEAR SENIOR TROY
WOOLFOLK: Things were looking
up for the oft-injured Woolfolk.
After losing his starting corner
spot to Blake Countess, it appeared
he had found a niche at safety as
part of a three-headed monster,
with Jordan Kovacs and Thomas
Gordon. He beat out Gordon for
a starting spot against Iowa.
Initially against Illinois, he was
1.1 getting his reps as well. Then his
competitor at his position, Gordon,
recovered another fumble, his
fourth of the season. Gordon also
has an interception. Woolfolk's
replacement is a turnover machine. 0
Then the injury bug popped up
and bit Woolfolk yet again. In
ra the third quarter, Fighting Illini
quarterback Nathan Scheelhaase
ran to the pylon for a touchdown.

he couldn't get there and then
