CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

New state policy 

requires parents to 
receive education 
before opting out

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

Health officials declared mea-

sles eliminated from the United 
States in 2000, but the recent 
outbreak in December, originat-
ing in Disneyland, has resulted in 
102 measles cases during January 
alone, according to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention.

Common 
vaccines 
protect 

against serious diseases including 
measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis 
B, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, tet-
anus and chickenpox. In an inter-
view with CBS on Sunday, CDC 
Director Thomas Frieden said the 
CDC has seen a growing number 
of people who are not vaccinated 
in recent years, which makes com-
munities more vulnerable to such 
outbreaks.

“That number is building up 

among young adults and adults in 
society,” Frieden said. “And that 
makes us vulnerable. We have to 

make sure that measles doesn’t get 
a foothold in the U.S.”

Richard Besser, ABC News’ 

chief health and medical editor, 
said on ABC News last month that 
unvaccinated children are at risk 
of falling sick with various diseas-
es, and also put vaccinated people 
around them at risk because vac-
cines are not 100-percent protec-
tive.

In an e-mail interview, Mary 

Tocco, director of vaccine research 
at Michigan Opposing Manda-
tory Vaccines, said unvaccinated 
children are not the problem. She 
said measles vaccines are ineffec-
tive and unvaccinated children are 
blamed to hide this reality. Tocco 
added that the media is overhyp-
ing how dangerous the outbreak 
really is.

“This witch-hunt for unvacci-

nated children is a smokescreen 
for vaccine failure!” Tocco wrote. 
“(Measles) is not an epidemic! As 
of Jan. 23, 2015, there are only 101 
people in 11 states that have mea-
sles!”

Suzanne Waltman, president 

of Michigan Opposing Manda-
tory Vaccines, said the risks of 
vaccination outweigh the benefits, 
mentioning severe side effects, the

Even in a country shaped by 

race relations, Detroit stands out. 
The story of race in the city has 
its own complexity beyond that of 
many others.

However, so often the story gets 

reduced down to one topic: the 
racial clashes in 1943 and 1967.

Those 
events 
are 
notable 

moments in Detroit history, but 
the long-term circumstances and 
story surrounding them are often 
lost to oversimplification.

Melba Joyce Boyd is a distin-

guished professor and chair of the 
Wayne State University Africana 
Studies Department, with a long 
list of literary accolades. Boyd 
grew up in Detroit. Her family 
started out in the southwest side 
of the city but eventually moved 
to Conant Gardens, where Boyd’s 
mother still lives.

While discussing the racial 

history of Detroit overall, Boyd is 
quick to point out that the topic is 
nuanced.

“It’s more complicated than 

outsiders understand,” she said. 

“Race relations in Detroit have 
sort of been dynamic depending 
what period of history you’re look-
ing at.”

From the outset of Detroit’s 

founding, race helped develop of 
the city, starting with the indig-
enous population who had already 
formed a society before the French 
arrived and created what is known 
as Detroit today.

Boyd noted the unique racial 

dynamic of Detroit’s early years, 
pointing to both the role of free 
Black explorers accompanying 
the French in founding the city, 
as well as the fact that a large por-
tion of the slaves held were Native 
Americans.

Moving forward in the city’s 

history, Detroit played a signifi-
cant role for Blacks during the 
Civil War because of its proxim-
ity to Canada. The city’s Under-
ground Railroad network out of 
the country offered freedom from 
both slavery and oppression for 
free Blacks.

Boyd said at the outset of the 

Industrial Revolution, the begin-
nings of the auto industry in the 
city and the subsequent appeal 
of plentiful work attracted both 
southern Blacks and whites to 
Detroit. That demographic trend 
meant that at the same time the 
city was seen as a source of pros-
perity for many Black families, a 
public sympathizer with the Ku 
Klux Klan was also elected mayor 
briefly in 1930.

Professors explore 

implications of 
‘The Interview,’ 
rights restrictions 

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

While 
buzz 
surrounding 

the release of “The Interview” 
may not have resulted from the 
movie’s merit, the cyber hack 
in response to its approaching 
release sparked a national con-
versation on freedom of speech 
in the face of a possible terrorist 

threat.

Recent international chal-

lenges to free speech in pop cul-
ture and in print were the topic 
of the International Institute’s 
Round Table on Thursday eve-
ning at the Michigan League.

The round table included 

Prof. Juan Cole, director for the 
Center for Middle Eastern and 
North African Studies; Daniel 
Herbert, 
associate 
professor 

of screen arts and culture; and 
Law Profs. Herzog and Steven 
Ratner.

Prof. Karla Mallette, direc-

tor of the Center for European 
Studies and Islamic Studies 
Program, served as the modera-

tor for the discussion and said 
the panel was held to consider 
recent challenges to freedom of 
speech, which she character-
ized as the “conceptual corner-
stone of liberal society.”

To open, Mallette cited the 

recent controversy over “The 
Interview” and how its plot, 
which revolved around the 
assassination of North Korean 
dictator Kim Jong-un, resulted 
in a cyber attack on Sony Pic-
tures.

“The movie essentially blew 

up in Sony’s hands, making Sony 
Pictures a target in one of the 
most successful cyber-terrorism 

City Council to

Here comes the sun.
At the Ann Arbor City Coun-

cil meeting Monday night, coun-
cilmembers approved a contract 
between the city of Ann Arbor and 
DTE Energy to build a solar panel 
farm at the Ann Arbor Municipal 
Airport.

Nearly 14 acres of city-owned 

land, located just south of Ann 
Arbor, will be used to create the 
solar farm. Councilmember Sabra 
Briere (D–Ward 1), Ann Arbor 
Mayor Christopher Taylor (D) 
and Councilmember Mike Anglin 
(D–Ward 5) co-sponsored the ini-
tiative.

Briere wrote in an e-mail inter-

view that the 20-year contract is 
renewable and all revenue pro-
duced will go directly toward 
funding 
airport 
improvement 

projects like replacing aging han-
gars.

According to the contract, 

DTE Energy will be responsible 
for building and maintaining the 
project.

Appropriations 
subcommittee 

considers funding 
history, financial aid 

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

LANSING — The Appropria-

tions subcommittee on Higher 
Education met Thursday to dis-
cuss how the higher education 
budget will be laid out for the 

upcoming year.

Higher education advocates 

have expressed several areas of 
concern over the potential for a 
cut in funding in the upcoming 
budget, following both a project-
ed deficit and a proposed change 
in where the University’s state 
funding comes from. Republican 
Gov. Rick Snyder is expected to 
announce his budget Wednesday.

The deficit stems from an 

unexpectedly high number of 
businesses cashing in on previ-
ously allocated tax credits in the 
state’s general budget. Initial 

estimates from the House Fiscal 
Agency put the deficit at $454.4 
million, but more recent reports 
from Michigan Budget Director 
John Robert estimate about $325 
million.

Rep. 
Jeff 
Irwin 
(D–Ann 

Arbor), a member of the com-
mittee, said in an interview after 
the meeting that the deficit could 
have a significant impact on high-
er education institutions in the 
state.

“The budget deficit certainly 

puts pressure on higher education 
funding, and that’s going to make 

it more difficult for us to continue 
to make progress on funding our 
institutions of higher learning in 
a way that makes sense,” he said.

In May, the state’s electorate 

will vote on a series of proposed 
bills that are intended to provide 
funding to fix Michigan’s roads. 
As part of the plan, the School Aid 
Fund will only be eligible for use 
by community colleges and K-12 
programs.

Public universities in the state 

currently receive close to 13 per-
cent of their state funding from

and $81K per year,” Briere wrote. 
“The City will make no invest-
ment other than the land.”

During Monday’s meeting, Bri-

ere said the Ann Arbor airport is 
the best place for the solar panel 
to be installed because it is far 
enough from residences, a con-
cern among some opposed to the 
contract.

Scott Simons, a spokesman for 

DTE Energy, said the contract 
between the energy company and 
Ann Arbor is part of a larger com-
pany goal to derive 10 percent of 
the company’s produced energy 
from renewable sources. Under 
Michigan’s 2008 Clean, Renew-
able and Efficient Energy Act, 

Michigan electricity suppliers are 
required to include at least this 
amount of renewable energy by 
2015.

Ninety percent of DTE’s renew-

able energy will come from wind 
energy, with the remaining 5 per-
cent derived from solar energy 
and biofuels, Simons said.

DTE’s initiative to use more 

renewable 
energy 
sources 

includes customer-owned and 
utility-owned programs. The util-
ity-owned programs require that 
the company partner with a host 
organization. In this case, the host 
organization is the city of Ann 
Arbor.

Simons said 20 utility-owned 

sites like the one planned in Ann 
Arbor have already been built and 
another six will be finished by the 
end of 2015.

DTE has similar solar panel 

contracts including one with 
Monroe County Community Col-
lege, Blue Cross Blue Shield in 
Detroit, Mercy High School in 
Farmington Hills, two with Gen-
eral Motors plants and two with 
the University.

Simons cited Ann Arbor’s 

interest in increasing the city’s 
use of renewable energy as a 
motivation for the councilmem-
bers to approve the contract.

Taylor said the solar panel ini-

tiative is part of a larger plan to 
improve the city’s sustainability 
efforts.

“We have a sustainability 

framework which provides the 
direction for some of these city 
actions,” Taylor said. “We have 
a climate action plan to increase

LSA student government hosts 
discussion on entrepreneurship

Six alumni speak on 

their experiences 

building and 

sustaining startups

By TANAZ AHMED

Daily Staff Reporter

The LSA Student Govern-

ment hosted an alumni connec-
tions event on entrepreneurship 
and the liberal arts Thursday 
night in the Michigan Union 
Pond Room.

The event, called “Inno-

vate Your Future,” featured six 
alumni guests.

Members 
of 
the 
Student 

Assembly’s 
academic 
affairs 

committee, 
LSA 
sophomore 

Julia Gips and LSA senior 
Rachel 
Rickles 
created 
the 

event in light of the new LSA 
entrepreneurship minor as well 
as to facilitate relationships 

between students and alumni.

“It’s a great way for students 

with specific interests to meet 
with the right people rather 
than just having a general group 
of alumni so that students can 
really feel that they’re having 
a meaningful experience,” Gips 
said.

Josh 
Buoy, 
co-creator 
of 

brand consultancy firm Snow-
day, and Lisa Bee, owner of 
Sweetwaters Coffee & Tea, 
attended 
the 
event. 
Jason 

Harper, director of online strat-
egy for FordDirect, and Fiona 
Ruddy, 
director 
of 
Eastern 

Market’s food access programs, 
were also in attendance. Jeff 
Sorenson, co-founder of opti-
Mize, and Rich Yoo, the vice 
president of innovation at Matt-
son & Co., spoke as well.

“Our speakers are from a 

diverse range of backgrounds,” 
Rickles said. “They have diverse 
entrepreneurial 
experiences 

and that’s something that we 
wanted to highlight given the 
relevance of the new minor.”

The event was organized in 

a round robin style, where the 
alumni rotated around small 
groups of students and spent 
approximately 10 minutes talk-
ing with each group. Students 
were encouraged to approach 
individual alumni after the 
round robin discussions fin-
ished.

The speakers told students 

about their reasons for becom-
ing entrepreneurs and how they 
got to where they are today.

“I was frustrated with the 

fact that so many students 
would come up with awesome 
ideas in classes I was in and 
then classes would end and no 
one would do anything,” Soren-
son said while discussing why 
he created optiMize.

Many 
of 
the 
alumni 

explained the importance of 
finding a niche and meeting a 
need not currently being met 
when considering creating a 
startup. They also spoke about 
entrepreneurship as a tool for 
social improvement.

“No matter what you do or 

who you work with, it’s about 
trying to solve problems and 
make lives better,” Buoy said.

The 
passion 
needed 
to 

become an entrepreneur was 
discussed as well.

“If there’s not enough drive, 

you can take a 100 business 
classes and it’s not going to 
help,” Bee said.

One attendee, LSA freshman 

Josh Carn-Saferstein, noted his 
passion for entrepreneurship 
and the opportunities the event 
offered.

“I just love everything about 

entrepreneurship,” Carn-Safer-
stein said. “I know possibilities 
are endless but you don’t realize 
what you can do until you actu-
ally go out and do something.”

New data science major set to 
be launched next fall semester

Program will 
incorporate 

interdisciplinary 
course options 

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

The University will offer a 

new program in data science, 
beginning in the fall semester of 
2015.

According to an e-mail sent to 

informatics students last month, 
the new Data Science program 
will ultimately take over the Data 
Mining and Information Analy-
sis track within the informatics 
major. All students already pur-
suing the latter track can still 
finish it, or choose to switch over 
to a major in data science. Com-
pared to the previous program, 
Data Science will be more inter-
disciplinary in nature, including 
courses in electrical engineering 
and computer science.

Vijay Nair, a professor of sta-

tistics and industrial and opera-
tions engineering, as well as one 
of several faculty leaders of this 
new program, said faculty have 

been discussing launching this 
program for about two years. He 
said they expect it to start small, 
but added that it will likely grow 
due to employer demand for can-
didates with data science train-
ing.

“There’s a lot of demand for 

people who are training as data 
scientists,” he said. “The field 
covers a number of different 
areas that no single department 
right now in LSA offers.”

The program will start with 

a major only, but Nair said he 
expects a minor will follow soon 
afterwards.

LSA junior Annemarie Ell-

man, who is currently on the 
informatics Data Mining and 
Information Analysis track, said 
she thinks data science is a huge 
field, especially for careers in 
information systems.

According to the Michigan 

Institute for Data Science web-
site, data science is now widely 
accepted as a fourth mode of 
scientific discovery, along with 
theory, physical experimentation 
and computational analysis. A 
2011 McKinsey Global Institute 
report estimated that the United 
States will face a job shortage by 

2018 of 140,000 to 190,000 peo-
ple with analytical skills.

Additionally, Ellman said the 

program will open doors for Col-
lege of Engineering students. She 
said while informatics is mainly 
an LSA program, many of the 
additional classes required for 
Data Science are electrical engi-
neering and computer science 
classes, which Engineering stu-
dents have to take within their 
program already.

“Since data is a huge topic, 

especially big data, I think it will 
attract more College of Engi-
neering students interested in 
pursuing something that focuses 
more on data science,” she said.

LSA senior Reid Mechanick, 

who is also on the data mining 
track, said in his experience, 
employers have found itim-
portant that he knows how to 
understand and analyze data.

Though he is a senior and 

already finished with most of 
his requirements, he said many 
younger students he has talked 
with are considering switching 
over to the Data Science pro-
gram, and there’s lots of student 
interest in the program.

potential contribution to the recent 
increase in autism.

“We have to consider that vac-

cination is a toxin,” Waltman said. 
“You are injecting yourself with 
a virus, mercury, aluminum and 
formaldehyde.”

Waltman added that she believes 

the best way to fight diseases is by 
maintaining a healthy immune sys-
tem through natural methods such 
as proper nutrition and exercise.

Gary Freed, professor of pediat-

rics and community health, holds 
a different viewpoint. He said vac-
cines are beneficial because they 
prevent life-threatening illnesses. 
He also said research shows vac-
cines are safe, and that studies 
emphasizing the danger of vacci-
nation are incorrect and have been 
discredited. Freed denied the link 
between vaccinations and autism.

“There have been many scares 

about the side effects of vaccines,” 
Freed said. “From research that 
has been proven incorrect, has 
been fraudulent, has been discred-
ited, yet still lives on the Internet 
and is still spoken about by people.”

Michigan is one of 20 states that 

exempt people from vaccination 
for non-medical reasons, includ-
ing religious and personal beliefs. 
Forty-eight states allow exemp-
tions for religious reasons, but not 
for personal beliefs.

Robert Ernst, medical director 

at the University Health System 
medical director, said this law 
prevents UHS from building a vac-
cination registry that would keep 
track of the students’ vaccination 
records. Ernst said as a result, UHS 
does not know the exact rate of 
unvaccinated students.

“We don’t really know,” he said. 

“There is no such statute for indi-
viduals entering college in Michi-
gan, so we have not had a very 
robust registry of individual stu-

dents’ vaccination record to know 
the percentage of students who are 
unvaccinated.”

Since Jan. 1, a new Michigan 

Department of Community Health 
policy requires parents in Michi-
gan to receive education from a 
health worker before opting their 
children out of vaccination for non-
medical reasons.

Freed said parents not vaccinat-

ing their children for non-medical 
reasons does not have a benefit, but 
rather leaves children at risk for 
potential consequences of the dis-
eases, such as paralysis from polio 
or brain damage from whooping 
cough.

In the end, the parents make the 

ultimate choice to vaccinate their 
children or not, not the clinicians. 
According to Freed, parents refus-
ing to vaccinate their children can 
lead to doctors refusing to treat the 
children in the future.

“(Some doctors) don’t want those 

children to put the other children 
at the practice at risk of preventable 
diseases,” Freed said. “Some also 
believe that if parents don’t trust 
the physician’s judgment for advice 
for regarding something basic 
like immunizations, then they are 
unlikely to develop a shared vision 
for the care for their children for 
other preventive care, or care when 
the child becomes ill.”

Sarah Clark, associate research 

scientist at the Department of 
Pediatrics and Communicable Dis-
eases, said college students are not 
traditionally considered “vulner-
able,” but they are at risk since they 
live in close proximity to one other 
and suffer from unhealthy condi-
tions such as sleep deprivation. As 
a result, it is easy for a disease to 
spread through dorms and houses.

Clark added that students still 

could get vaccinated if they did not 
as children, and they should do it 
as soon as possible to minimize the 
chances of exposing themselves to 
the preventable diseases.

“The time to (get vaccinated) is 

now,” she said.

On top of that, Detroit also 

experienced the conflict between 
Blacks and whites seen in most 
all U.S. cities, such as housing 
discrimination, police brutality 
and segregated schools and busi-
nesses. These issues would persist 
throughout the 20th century and 
shape much of the city’s racial his-
tory.

What made Detroit stand out 

from the broader national narra-
tive, Boyd said, was that despite 
clear discrimination towards the 
Black community — similar to 
many other areas — the city also 
had uniquely prosperous African-
American neighborhoods.

“By the time you get to 1967, 

Black people are probably enjoy-
ing a better economic existence 
than any other place in the coun-
try,” Boyd said. “In Detroit, Black 
people lived in houses; they didn’t 
live in tenement buildings. That’s a 
huge difference on quality of life.”

Racial clashes in Detroit

“It had this feel of being a city 

under siege, of being attacked.”

Marian 
Krzyzowski, 
direc-

tor of the University Institute for 
Research on Labor, Employment 
and the Economy, recounted his 
experience living through the 1967 
Detroit “race riot” as being surreal, 
movie-like. At 19 years old during 
the events, Krzyzowski recalled 
seeing stores in his neighborhood 
burned and tanks and U.S. soldiers 
scattered throughout the city. He 
remembers sleeping with his fam-
ily downstairs and away from any 
windows to the sound of distant 
gunfire.

“Essentially, it was a war zone,” 

he said.

In Detroit’s history, two major 

— and at least partly racially moti-
vated — clashes prompted federal 
Army intervention, caught nation-
wide media attention and led to 
brutality, extensive property dam-
age and murder.

The first incident took place in 

June 1943.

History Prof. Charlie Bright 

and Assistant History Prof. Ste-
phen Ward said leading up to the 
1943 riot, Detroit had been experi-
encing an influx of new residents 
from the South, both white and 
Black, in the wake of the new jobs 
created through the booming auto 
industry.

Though jobs for the migrants 

were plentiful, housing was not. 
No new housing had been con-
structed since the Great Depres-
sion, and Black residents were 
excluded from almost all public 
housing projects, forcing them to 
cram into 60 square blocks on the 
city’s east side, an area that ironi-
cally came to be known as “Para-
dise Valley.”

In response to the overcrowd-

ing and shortage of living spaces 
for both Blacks and whites, in 1941, 
the Detroit Housing Commission 
approved two sites for housing 
projects, one for Blacks and one for 
whites, in a predominantly white 
area. Many whites protested the 
project and upon its completion, 
when Black citizens had already 
signed leases, over 1,000 white 
residents picketed, vowing to keep 
out any Black residents.

The tension over housing, over-

crowded public facilities and the 
brutal heat of the summer all led 
to several small-scale scuffles 
between Black and white citizens 

during the summer of 1943.

“The 
city 
was 
physically 

crammed,” Bright said.

On June 20, a brawl broke out 

on Belle Isle between Blacks and 
whites. After the brawl, rumors 
circulated as to what took place 
— many Black Detroiters claimed 
whites had thrown a Black woman 
and her baby off the Belle Isle 
Bridge, while white Detroiters 
said a Black man raped and killed 
a white woman.

In response to the rumors, over 

500 Black residents rioted and 
looted throughout the night, while 
white men beat Black men leaving 
the Roxy Theatre on Woodward 
Avenue.

Over the next 36 hours, Detroit 

faced constant looting, rioting 
and conflict between Blacks and 
whites. It was not until Detroit 
Mayor Edward Jeffries Jr. asked 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
to send in federal troops that the 
mobs began to dissipate.

“It’s a crowded city full of hos-

tility, and a rumor or an altercation 
can set it off,” Bright said.

The riot claimed 34 lives: 9 

whites and 25 Blacks. Out of those 
25, 16 Black men died at the hands 
of police officers.

In response to the riot and 

months 
of 
increasing 
strain 

between whites and Blacks in the 
city, both the local and federal 
government attempted to allevi-
ate tension through measures 
like increasing federally financed 
public housing and working to 
advance Black prospects within 
the labor movement.

“These are responses indirectly, 

consequences really, of a collision 
between the races and crowded 
conditions that lead to federal 
policies that try to alleviate those 
conditions,” Bright said. “(Those 
policies) produce new conditions 
of ghetto concentrations of Afri-
can Americans inside the city and 
suburban sprawl of whites outside 
the city, both products in part of 
federal interventions.”

However, with increasing pri-

vate housing available outside the 
city, many white citizens departed 
for the suburbs in the ‘40s and 
‘50s, a phenomenon referred to as 
“white flight.”

Ward and Bright said Black 

residents initially welcomed the 
shift, as it opened up affordable 
housing space in the city near the 
still-booming auto industries.

Both stressed that the riot in 

1943 did not directly lead to factors 
like white flight and police brutal-
ity — factors that contributed to 
the ‘67 uprising — but were instead 
an expression of the ongoing cir-
cumstances for Black and white 
residents of the city.

In essence, Bright said racial 

tension was not caused simply 
through the riots, but was a long 
term presence in the city.

“The riots are symbolic events, 

but they capture and express the 
eruption of forces that are not 
resolved, and the continued inabil-
ity to resolve these problems con-
tinues now,” Bright said. “We’re 
pushing against the notion that 
there are living consequences of 
‘43 and ‘67 and rather seeing ‘43 
and ‘67 as living consequences of 
unresolved race relations in the 
city.”

The second major conflict 

occurred between the police and 
Black residents in the city.

Before the uprising of 1967, and 

unlike the context of the ‘43 race 
riot, Black citizens held relatively 

more recognition and political 
cachet, as the civil rights move-
ment and the Black Power move-
ment ramped up during the 1960s 
and 1970s in the United States.

According to Ward and Bright, 

both federal and state govern-
ments were starting to recognize 
the rights and challenges facing 
Black communities. For example, 
Black citizens held seats in the 
Detroit school board.

Feeling threatened, some white 

residents sought to keep their 
privilege over Black residents pri-
marily through the police.

“There was a population of 

whites in the city that resented 
concessions to the civil rights 
movement, or the movement for 
Blacks to be able to buy houses in 
neighborhoods where they want-
ed to live, and so on,” Bright said. 
“There was a resentment in the 
power centers of the city for going 
over to the other side, and they 
looked at the police as the last line 
of defense of white power.”

Bright added that though Mayor 

Jerome Cavanaugh attempted to 
reform the notably racist police 
force, the endeavor failed.

“Clearly a police department 

that’s almost all white, in a city 
that’s had a significant African 
American population, is a formula 
for disaster,” Krzyzowski said.

The ‘67 uprising was triggered 

by a police raid of a “blind pig,” or 
unlicensed bar, on the corner of 
12th Street and Clairmount Ave-
nue, one of the poorest neighbor-
hoods in the city, during which 82 
arrested patrons were arrested.

Following reports that police 

were using excessive force on the 
arrested patrons, a crowd grew 
around the bar and began to throw 
objects at police cars and loot 
nearby stores.

After an ensuing day of violence 

between police officers and resi-
dents, along with vandalism and 
buildings set aflame, Cavanaugh 
requested Army troops and the 
National Guard be brought in to 
quell the violence. They arrived 
one day after the police raid and 
stayed for four more days.

According to The New York 

Times, at the end of the five-day 
uprising, local police killed 20 
residents and the Army troops 
and National Guardsmen killed 
10, leaving 43 dead in total. Among 
the dead, 10 were white and 33 
were Black.

“It wasn’t a race riot in the 

sense of white against Black,” 
Krzyzowski said. “This wasn’t 
a race riot; this was a rebellion 
of years and years of frustration 
exploding and when it exploded 
everything just went to hell.”

At one of the Detroiters Speak 

Series hosted by the University’s 
Semester in Detroit Program, 
Detroit Reverend Dan Aldridge 
and David Goldberg, assistant 
professor at Wayne State, echoed 
many of the same points. 

“It’s so similar to what we see 

transpiring with ‘Black Lives 
Matter’ today,” Goldberg said, 
specifically discussing the police 
decision to hold the arrested on 
Belle Isle and the poor treatment 
they received from the police. 
“You have in social movements 
events that prove to be a spark and 
the event that is a spark sometimes 
isn’t necessarily something that’s 
distinctive.”

Goldenberg added there were 

several smaller incidents during 
that summer that set the stage for 
an eruption, creating a general 

racial frustration in the city.

“I mention this because Mike 

Brown being killed by police, that 
happens, according to studies, 
basically every 28, 24 hours right? 
He’s not the only one this happens 
to but there’s certain moments,” he 
said. “The blind pig being raided in 
the summer of 1967 wasn’t distinc-
tive, that happened all the time.”

Aldridge also said the situation 

for Black Detroiters went beyond 
just issues with the police. The 
Black community had been largely 
deteriorating, he said, noting in 
particular poor economic oppor-
tunity as jobs started moving out 
of the city. He added that much 
of the city’s new development at 
that time only served white work-
ers in the suburbs, saying projects 
like the freeways uprooted Black 
neighborhoods and destroyed the 
Black middle class.

“The 
Detroit 
conflagration 

didn’t just happen one night. This 
was some decades in the begin-
ning and it was an explosion,” he 
said.

While these first and second-

hand accounts tell a complicated 
story, according to Krzyzowski, 
the media portrayal of the uprising 
suggested a racial clash, as it tend-
ed to present Black looters when it 
was proven that many looters and 
rioters were white.

In his own experience after the 

riot, Krzyzowski said he found 
most white people tended to make 
assumptions that Black people had 
a significantly negative role to play, 
even though the Black citizens 
experienced the majority of fatali-
ties and injuries.

“It was a confirmation or vali-

dation of their racist stereotypes 
of African Americans,” he said. “I 
wouldn’t say everyone did, but it 
was there significantly.”

The fraction of white residents 

in the city fell from 70.8 percent in 
1960 to 55.5 percent in 1970 and to 
34.4 percent in 1980.

In 2010, white residents only 

made up 10.6 percent of the city’s 
population.

Ward said the change in the 

demographics of the city was 
not directly caused by the riot, as 
many whites were already exiting 
the city due to the changing ste-
reotypes of Blacks at the time.

In beginning of the 20th cen-

tury, Blight and Ward described 
the “biggest threat” to a white 
family as a Black family moving 
in. With the emergence of the civil 
rights movement and growing 
racial acceptance, this stereotype 
quelled. However, through the 
growing number of Black citizens 
in cities across the nation and sim-
ilar uprisings, many white citizens 
began to fear the “lone Black mug-
ger in the shadows,” Bright said.

“Black people and crime and 

cities all came to be associated 
in this period, largely because of 
these riots or uprising,” Ward said.

Because of these growing ste-

reotypes and increasing afford-
ability for suburban homes, rather 
than specifically the riots, white 
people left the city en masse.

“An acceleration of so called 

‘white flight’ is an impact of ‘67, 
but it’s often said, but it’s too 
sophisticated to say ‘67 caused or 
continued white flight. All those 
dynamics a part of ‘67 intensifies 
and those contribute to why peo-
ple are leaving the city,” Ward said. 
“ ‘67 accelerates a process that was 
already happening: of whites leav-
ing the city, of racial dynamics.”

the School Aid Fund, as part of the 
$1.2 billion they receive from the 
General Fund. The Snyder admin-
istration has said the funding will 
now come entirely from the Gener-
al Fund, as was the practice several 
years ago.

In addition to the monies from 

the General Fund, 13.5 percent of 
higher education funding comes 
from state-restricted funds, and 6.4 
percent from federal funds. These 
in total comprise the over $1.5 bil-
lion that is distributed to colleges 
and universities across the state.

During the meeting, represen-

tatives highlighted that higher 
education 
funding 
has 
seen 

significant cuts in the past few 
decades, which has resulted in a 
rise in tuition. Over the past few 
years, state funding has fluctuat-
ed — in 2011, Snyder cut funding 
for higher education by 15 per-
cent, but has raised it incremen-
tally since.

2002 was the first year that 

the amount that the state appro-
priates was less than the amount 
paid by students, according to a 
report presented at the meeting 
by Marilyn Peterson, committee 
clerk and senior fiscal analyst.

Since then the gap between 

student tuition and state appro-
priations has only grown, accord-
ing to the report.

Students contributed 71.4 per-

cent of the total $5.9 billion that 
comprised the Public Univer-
sity General Fund Revenue for the 
2013-2014 fiscal year. State appro-
priation only made up 21.3 percent 
of it, and 7.3 percent came from 
other sources.

“With the increasing reliance on 

tuition and fees, and decreasing on 
appropriations, the numbers sim-
ply work out that it becomes more 
difficult to make a large impact 
with state appropriation dollars,” 
Peterson said.

Irwin said the issue of rising 

tuition isn’t new, but rather had 
accumulated over a long period of 
time.

“You can draw a straight line 

between declining state support 
for higher education and increas-
ing tuition,” Irwin said, “That’s 
what’s driving the outrage in stu-
dent debt loads, and that’s the prob-
lem that the last couple decades of 
budgeting has caused.”

The majority of the commit-

tee also asked questions regarding 
how Michigan’s state funding to 
student funding ratio compared to 
other states’, which Peterson said 
she wasn’t certain.

The largest percent of the $1.5 

billion 
that 
state 
institutions 

receive in appropriations — 88.4 
percent — goes directly to univer-
sities through University Opera-
tional Support. The University of 
Michigan receives more funding 
for operational support than any 
other in the state: $295.2 million. 
The amount that each university 
receives is calculated based on the 
institution’s number of full-time 
students.

Seven percent of the remaining 

higher education appropriation 
goes to financial aid, 3.9 percent 
goes to MSU AgBioResearch/
Extension, 0.4 percent goes to 
other university funding, and the 
remaining 0.3 percent is appropri-
ated to other higher education pro-
grams.

During the meeting, members of 

the subcommittee asked whether 
the $500,000 provided for the 
North American Indian Tuition 
waivers is enough. The North 
American Indian Tuition waiver 
gives free tuition to Michigan pub-
lic higher education students of at 
least one-quarter Native American 
descent.

State Rep. Michael McCready 

(R–Birmingham), the committee 
chair, asked what happens if there 
are more students of Native Ameri-
can descent enrolled in public insti-
tutions than the amount of money 
allocated to the fund.

“What’s presumed to be rolled 

up into the University Operations 
Grants does fall short of the actual 
cost of the tuition waiver pro-
grams,” Peterson said.

She added that universities typi-

cally make up the shortfall through 
their general funds.

The subcommittee also ques-

tioned whether language about 
the portion of financial aid funding 
currently allocated to the Michigan 
Competitive scholarship, which 
provides aid to students who attain 
a qualifying ACT score and demon-
strate financial need, will be rewrit-
ten to reflect the fact that public 
schools in Michigan will now take 
the SAT instead of the ACT.

Besides the budget, the commit-

tee also discussed a concern for the 
future — the decrease in student 
enrollment in higher education in 
Michigan. There has been a grow-
ing trend of students not complet-
ing high school and in turn not 
going on to college, Peterson told 
the committee.

At least in the immediate time 

frame, that trend is not expected to 
change, she added.

However, unlike other schools in 

the country, the University did not 
experience a significant decrease in 
enrollment for the fall 2014 term.

campaigns on record,” Mallette 
said.

Herbert said he believed it was 

unlikely that “The Interview” 
would cause a domino effect in 
Hollywood and would not result 
in qualms among producers and 
filmmakers toward releasing simi-
lar movies. He said, however, the 
effect of the hack on Sony has been 
chilling.

“It’s not this chilling effect that 

concerns me most, but rather, the 
chilling effect that the Sony hack-
ers could and likely will hack on 
the freedom of discretion of pri-
vate individuals who work in a 
large institution,” Herbert said.

Ratner specializes in counter-

terrorism, 
human 
rights 
and 

international law. He focused his 
discussion on the regulation of 
speech in international communi-
ties on the basis of the Internation-
al Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.

In his argument, Ratner said 

globally, court cases concerning 
free speech often result in restric-
tions on the speaker’s rights, 
unlike in the United States.

“The fact is that international 

human rights law and European 
human rights law gives the state 
a significant degree of discretion 
to prohibit certain forms of hate 
speech,” Ratner said. “It’s very dif-
ferent from what we’re used to in 
the United States, but it’s one that 
comes out of a tradition where the 
rest of the world sees it as retalia-
tion to awful crimes.”

However, 
Ratner 
said 
the 

robust regulation and policing of 

free speech in some international 
communities is not always feasible 
and rationally warranted from the 
state.

“The state can’t just completely 

cut off free speech just because 
they’re advancing a legitimate 
goal,” Ratner said. “They have to 
do it in a method that’s propor-
tional.”

LSA juniors Erica Dickinson 

and Fatima Chowdhury said they 
thought the event was important 
to be held at the University and 
realized that unregulated freedom 
of speech was difficult to come by 
in any modern state.

“There is no absolute freedom 

of speech anywhere in the world, 
but the U.S. comes closest,” Dick-
inson said.

Chowdhury said inclusion of 

the power of the Internet as a 
forum for free speech is a neces-

sary segment in discussions of free 
speech both nationally and across 
countries.

“I think the Internet changes 

things. The Internet definitely 
changes things,” she said. “A lot 
of governments can track citizens 
and what they say and persecute 
them based on (the Internet), 
which they couldn’t do in the 
past.”

This makes international law 

more important, Dickinson said, 
when news stories or blog posts 
targeting international cultural 
groups become more accessible to 
those groups.

“If someone hears (appropria-

tion) in America and someone 
hears (appropriation) in Germany, 
you’ve already involved two coun-
tries and that changes the game,” 
she said.

Briere echoed Taylor’s com-

ments when discussing her own 

motivations for co-sponsoring the

“I believe that the City should 

continue to reduce its dependence 
on petroleum products,” Briere 
wrote. “As the City continues to

Juan Méndez, former first adviser to Kofi
 

Annan on the prevention of genocide, peered 
over his glasses at a packed auditorium at the 
University of Michigan. He had been tortured 
long ago under Argentinean totalitarianism. 
In a voice hardened by time, he slowed his 
speech when saying one word: abolish. We 
were here to discuss the abolition of torture, 
much like the abolition of slavery. It is inevi-
table. It is humane. It is, above all else, moral.

I couldn’t disagree. Torture. I played with 

the word a while. As it bounced around my 
mind, I was more worried about definitional 
semantics than the reality within and outside 
our borders. I won’t lie. I spaced out from the 
talk. I had deaf ears. Then, Professor Men-
dez hit me hard with: “Our culture is soft on 
the prohibition of torture, we have impunity 
towards torture.” Uh-oh. That was just me, 
and that is the problem.

Zing words: pre-9/11, post-9/11 society, 

the Patriot Act, advanced interrogation tech-
niques. “Zero Dark Thirty,” “Taken,” “24,” 
“Homeland,” etcetera, etcetera. The list of 
entertainment torture goes on. The take-home 
message from these works is simple: torture 
gets stuff done to keep America safe or is a 
cruel means to heroic ends. At least that’s how 
we rationalize it. But, ultimately, those who 
support torture are motivated by bottom-line, 
vengeful thinking. We all still have that bitter 
taste in our mouths from Sept. 11, 2001. We 
all know exactly where we were and what we 
were doing, and we want those terrorists to 
know what they put us through.

Still, even if passion causes us to aban-

don principle, we are forced to concede that 
the effectiveness of torture treads a fine line. 
The ends do not justify the means if we might 
not reach our ends at all. To stop the pain, 
“breaking points” become too often lies, false 
incriminations and cold leads. Khalid Sheikh 
Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 
attacks, was waterboarded time and again 
until he was broken. And yet the “information” 
he gave us led us on false trails, on goose hunts 
for made-up names. He had known nothing.

We must also be humble and recognize that 

torture is not within our common experience. 
Why not listen to those who have actually 
been tortured — are they not most worthy of 
an opinion? Maybe that’s why John McCain, 
who is otherwise an unapologetic war hawk 

and once promised to occupy Iraq for 100 
years, has been so outspoken against the 
atrocities committed in Guantanamo. John 
McCain has been tortured. Professor Mendez 
has been tortured.

I, on the other hand, have only seen Liam 

Neeson electrocute human traffickers to find 
his daughter. I have seen Jack Bauer pump 
excruciating serum through his victims’ veins 
to stop a nuclear bomb from exploding in L.A. 
I have seen Navy SEALs waterboard to get 
impossibly important information in the hunt 
for Bin Laden.

Anti-terror torture entertainment is on the 

rise, says Emily Clews, a student with E-Inter-
national Relations, and it is far from the truth 
in portraying the practice’s successes. Accord-
ing to Clews, anti-terror entertainment tor-
ture is fictionalized, glorified and has had an 
important effect on American attitudes. It 
numbs us.

This winter, The New York Times com-

mented on the Senate Intelligence Committee 
report done on the C.I.A. They found that in 
the name of democracy and national security, 
there was minimal disclosure of true C.I.A. 
torture practices and zero accountability for 
clear violations of international law on torture 
as of 2014.

I am not talking about censoring Liam Nee-

son. That’s un-American. My call to action is 
to act upon what Cesare Beccaria realized so 
long ago in the 18th century. There is no glory 
or heroism in torture. We can go back and 
forth for days on its effectiveness, whether or 
not it protects us and how necessary it is. Tor-
ture is wrong. That is where the conversation 
should begin and end. It is a matter of princi-
ple, and we should hold ourselves to the ideals 
of our founders and the ideals of Beccaria. And 
no matter how much Jack Bauer’s C.T.U. might 
numb us to those ideals, they are eternal.

While I was furiously taking notes during 

Professor Mendez’s lecture, he lamented a 
sad but important truth: “All the facts about 
torture are forgotten in one episode of ‘Home-
land’ or ‘24.’ ” But the vision of him, there, 
speaking to us, an auditorium full of smart, 
motivated young minds, reminded me that we 
are the New Abolitionists. Our mission starts 
with being well informed.

The New Abolitionists

Double-binded beauty

GABRIEL LUPU| VIEWPOINT
A 

while back, I stumbled 
upon a flyer-sized note 
being handed out by the 

Markley 
Com-

munity Center. It 
read, 
“Warning: 

objects in mirror 
may be distorted 
by socially con-
structed 
norms 

of ‘beauty.’ ” I 
found this note 
so amusing that 
I 
ran 
straight 

back to my apart-
ment and taped 
my own copy in the upper corner 
of my bathroom mirror. I then 
snapped a photo and sent it to my 
roommates who “lol”ed and said it 
 

was “cute.”

In the end, it wasn’t as helpful a 

note as I’d thought it would be. (I 
blame the positioning of the note. 
It’s too high up in the corner to see). 
During my usual morning routines, 
I would barely glance at it, and 
instead see the bags under my eyes, 
the frazzled hair being uncoopera-
tive, the unsightly flabs developing 
around the waist.

Last weekend, when I went back 

home, I initiated an awkward con-
versation with my mother that 
began with, “I’ve always thought 
you were prettier than me.” I pro-
ceeded to tell her, to my own con-
fusion, how I used to find photos 
of models and think she was bet-
ter looking, and that I thought I 
was the luckiest daughter in the 
world to have her as my mother. I 
also shared that when I was young-
er, part of the reason behind our 
arguments was due to my envy 
towards her.

It was embarrassing for the 

both of us. For me, because I had 
not anticipated such a confession 
to ever leave my thoughts. For her, 
because it was clear I put her in a 

dilemma in which she, as a mother, 
was both horrified that her daugh-
ter would think so lowly of her own 
appearances and also flattered that 
her daughter would suddenly com-
pliment her that highly. My mother 
had a hard time quelling that high-
pitched, girly giddiness in her voice 
as she hugged me and made the 
attempt to tell me how everything 
I just said couldn’t possibly be true.

The point I’m trying to raise is 

that, like my mother, a lot of us feel 
this strange double bind when it 
comes to beauty. We know “beauty 
is only skin-deep” and yet we still 
like hearing that maybe our skin 
isn’t completely hideous.

Personally, I’ve forced myself 

not to judge people based on their 
appearances. The closest I’ve ever 
gotten to admitting that I think my 
friends are beautiful was when one 
of them candidly shared her inse-
curities with her attractiveness and 
I 
responded 

poorly 
with, 

“Nah, 
you’re 

fine.” 
My 

natural reac-
tion to beauty 
campaign ads 
by companies 
like Dove is 
the 
eye-roll. 

I’ve 
tried 

really hard to 
embrace 
the 

idea of, “Let’s not tell everybody 
they’re beautiful and instead work 
to discredit the role that beauty 
plays in most women’s lives.”

And yet, in those rare moments 

when someone I admire or respect 
pays me a compliment regarding 
my appearance, it’s hard not to get 
a little flustered (sometimes for 
the whole day). Usually in those 
moments, while I’m reverting my 
clearly startled expression back to 
its resting aloof position, I’m inter-

nally indicting myself for being so 
shallow and hypocritical. I think 
there’s a part of me that fears I’ll 
start defining myself primarily on 
how I look, that I’ll spiral into some 
sort of shame-dependency relation-
ship with what people think of my 
face and body. And so I overcom-
pensate on to the other side by alto-
gether rejecting beauty as a useful 
and meaningful trait.

I think it’s strange that we get 

these mixed messages, and it’s 
potentially harmful to be stuck 
between them. I’ve considered 
tweaking my original idea that 
beauty shouldn’t matter. It may be 
idealistically sound, but it falls short 
in terms of practicality. Yes, beauty 
is in many ways a social construc-
tion, but it still means something. 
It’s very natural for us to be emo-
tionally affected by the values that 
surround us. For those of us who 
regularly demean and objectify our 

own bodies when 
we see them in 
the mirror, a neu-
tral “Nah, you’re 
fine” or “Beauty 
is only skin-deep, 
anyway” 
doesn’t 

really fix the tox-
icity that’s going 
on inside. I think 
voicing a genuine 
(let me emphasize 
genuine) 
appre-

ciation for how you put yourself 
together might do the more ben-
eficial work of shifting our society’s 
skewed values. The most ideal world 
we can have is one where we’re able 
to appreciate our diverse appear-
ances while also understanding its 
limitations and inability to capture 
the entirety of a human being. But 
that’s still a long ways away.

Beauty is in many 
many ways a social 
construction, but it 

still means something.

“D

o 
I 
contradict 

myself? Very well, 
then 
I 
contra-

dict myself, I am 
large, I contain 
 

multitudes.”

-Walt Whitman
My 
obsession 

with Walt Whit-
man 
began 
in 

the winter of my 
sophomore year of 
high school, when 
we learned about 
Transcendental-
ism: a 20th cen-
tury 
movement 

involving Walt Whitman and other 
famous nature-and-independence-
loving writers such as Henry David 
Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, 
and Margaret Fuller. The above 
quote specifically stuck out to me 
(and frequently comes into my head 
today) because I endlessly find 
myself in contradicting situations. 
One oddly perfect example of this 
was when I got my first car and 
named it “Walt” after the afore-
mentioned transcendentalist. I am 
not entirely sure how much Mr. 
Whitman would have appreciated 
having his name repurposed by a 
gas-guzzling car, but I like to think 
he would have forgiven me because 
of the vast contradicting nature 
 

of humankind.

Another contradiction that has 

been bothering me is my relation-
ship with paper. I have always been 
the sort of person who loves to read 

from books. I have stayed strong 
in my opposition to Nooks and 
Kindles and other electronic read-
ing systems because there is just 
something about holding a book in 
your hands, looking at real printed 
letters on smooth paper that cannot 
be replicated by just staring at an 
illuminated screen. The electronic 
“paperless” type of reading takes 
away from the bond between reader 
and author.

Yet 
my 

connec-
tion to print 
books 
con-

tradicts 
fiercely with 
my 
other 

connection 
to the envi-
ronment 
— 

my desire to 
save trees. I 
have felt this contradiction sharply 
this year, when as an LSA student 
it seems that I am always printing 
articles and stories and chapters 
and plays to read or struggling to 
decide whether or not it is really 
worth it to print. There is some-
thing soul sucking about spend-
ing hours reading off the glowing 
LED screen of my MacBook. But 
also when I stand by the printer 
and watch 20-30 pages print of an 
article I will probably only read 
once, I feel like I am personally 
responsible for the destruction of 
 

forests everywhere.

How do I reconcile these strong 

opposing feelings? Honestly, I’m 
not sure. Maybe the feeling that 
reading from a Nook is sacrilege 
and the feeling that printing 100 
pages a week is murder cannot go 
together. When I feel particularly 
perplexed, I just think of Uncle 
Walt’s quote. Being full of contra-
dictions is what makes us human. 
Everyone has conflicting values 
and desires and needs. That is why 

life is so confusing, 
and also why life is 
so vibrant.

It is possible to be 

obsessed with shop-
ping and oppose big 
business. It is pos-
sible to know that 
eating locally grown 
organic food is bet-
ter 
for 
the 
envi-

ronment 
but 
still 

physically 
need 

BurgerFi. I think the best way to 
deal with these contradictions is 
to humor each side, but in mod-
eration. Personally, the way I cope 
with my need for printed paper is 
by promising myself I will recycle 
it later. Modern society is not just 
going to disappear, and honestly, 
it shouldn’t. The point is, in terms 
of the environment, it actually is 
possible to “have your cake and eat 
it too.” Just don’t eat too much of 
it. And maybe buy the ingredients 
from a farmers market?

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

The Michigan Daily recently published 

a piece by Jamie Bircoll called “In defense 
of ‘American Sniper’ ” that has apparently 
become “blinded by its own ideological 
trappings.” This take on the film not only 
highlights critical inherent biases (read: blind 
spots) of Mr. Bircoll, but also a form of white 
privilege in greater media that few Americans 
recognize. Where Mr. Bircoll is able to find 
the beauty while blissfully ignoring the real 
world implications of such a movie, people of 
color, like myself, have to live with those real 
world implications of the film. Mr. Bircoll 
can see the art in the film while people like 
me (read: brown people) deal with harmful 
repercussions of fear-mongering media.

Let me make myself clear: I have no 

position on this actor, and to a great extent 
Chris Kyle either, but I do have a strong take 
on the American film industry’s complex 
of developing highly profitable films based 
off of fear mongering via the depiction of 
geopolitical events. This fear mongering for 
the “other” as well stems off a highly common 
archetype in film where our country glorifies 
a white male character for killing people of 
color, or, in this film, “the outsiders.”

Whether or not we see the film as 

propaganda is irrelevant; the fact of the 
matter is that media does influence people 
in a variety of ways. How we choose to 
think about media and allow it to consume 
our consciousness is entirely up to us. 
However, we cannot choose how such films 
can influence others around us and the real 
ramifications that has.

When I leave the theatre after watching 

the film and hear people giddy with joy 
about wanting to “kill the sand ni**ers” or 
going to sign up for the armed forces in order 
to “get those god damn towelheads,” it is 

hard for me to see the ‘good art’ when I am 
worrying about the safety of my community. 
As a turban-wearing Sikh American, I 
constantly find myself navigating ignorance 
in the United States. You would be astounded 
walking behind me for a day and hearing 
misconceptions about those that look like me 
or even about those that share a similar skin 
color to mine. I have never had this experience 
living in London, studying abroad in Costa 
Rica or conducting research in Peru. Only 
in America. Why you might ask? The truth 
is that other countries have more educated 
populations and have more important things 
to worry about.

If you go on Twitter and type in the 

#ChrisKyle and #America, you will read the 
most hate-filled and ignorant excuses for a 
false sense of nationalism that you have ever 
read in your entire life. You will be bombarded 
with posts from thousands of Americans 
talking about how much they hate Muslims, 
or brown people, or people with turbans or 
literally people with foreign accents.

At this point you may ask yourself why 

this matters. So people are stupid from time 
to time and make uninformed opinions. Who 
really gets affected by some annoying words? 
Well, people that look like me get affected.

Most acts of violence that have been 

committed 
against 
Sikh 
American 

communities have been rooted in ignorance 
and from misunderstanding who Sikhs are 
as a people. To date, there has never been 
a terrorist attack committed by someone 
identifying with the Sikh faith in the 
United States. Yet by allowing cycles of fear 
mongering to perpetuate, people’s fears 
foster into hate and, in turn, into violence.

According to a report conducted by the 

non-profit Sikh Coalition organization, half 

In defense of ‘common sense’

G.S. SURI | VIEWPOINT

of Sikh children report physical 
and verbal bullying in American 
schools due to being misidentified 
as terrorists. Last year, I had the 
honor of meeting Professor Prabhjot 
Singh of Columbia University, who 
was violently gang beaten in 2013 by 
several men in New York City after 
being mistaken for a terrorist. In 
August 2012, a white supremacist 
entered a gurdwara, a Sikh house of 
worship, in Oak Creek, Wisconsin 
and killed six Sikh Americans, 
having mistaken them as terrorists. 

Members of my religious family, the 
Sikh American community, have 
been killed. Today, there are still 
people who are scared to go to my 
local Gurdwara in Grand Rapids, 
Michigan because of the events that 
occurred on that day.

If we glorify the death of 

“outsiders” and do not acknowledge 
the 
political 
and 
real 
world 

ramifications 
of 
film, 
then 
it 

would be as if actions do not 
have consequences. If we create 
environment through media where 

disturbed people can think they are 
doing a service to society by killing 
people like me, then I think we 
would be fools not to understand the 
political and cultural ramifications 
that media can have.

So bless your heart, but I do not 

give a fuck about the art in “American 
Sniper”. I am more concerned with 
the implications of media, most 
prominently, it making it easier for 
people to justify hate and violence.

‘Off the Boat’ and 
into our hearts

New ABC comedy 
explores Asian-

American experience 

By KAREN HUA

Daily TV/New Media Editor

Just yesterday, ABC released 

a new comedy series that we may 
truly call ground-breaking tele-
vision. It’s the 
first sitcom in 
over 20 years to 
feature 
Asian-

Americans 
in 

primary 
roles. 

This year, ABC 
sought to diver-
sify 
its 
audi-

ence, with new 
sitcoms such as 
“Cristela” 
and 

“Black-ish” drawing huge ratings 
and critical acclaim.

“Fresh Off the Boat” is based on 

Chef Eddie Huang’s best-selling 
memoir, which details his expe-
rience growing up as a first-gen-
eration American with Chinese 
immigrant parents. The show’s 
premise revolves around Huang as 
an adolescent, whose eponymous 
character is played with charis-
matic candor by Hudson Yang 
(“The Sisterhood of Night”). The 
series aims to provide a humorous 
lens from which to view immi-
grant families, but it simultaneous-
ly tackles many the complexities 
of being American-born-Chinese 
(abbreviated ABC).

“Fresh Off the Boat” is the story 

of every “FOB” family’s pursuit of 
the American Dream. For Eddie’s 
father, Louis (Randall Park, “The 
Interview”), this means moving 
to Orlando to open a western cow-
boy restaurant, and for Eddie, this 
is simply the wish to fit into with 
suburban American normalcy. In 
the pilot episode, we jump into 
the life of Eddie, who is happily 
assimilated to American culture, 
and also a devout hip-hop aficiona-
do more “white” than he is Asian. 
However, though well-acclimated 
to the U.S., he has trouble adapt-
ing to his new school where he is 
called out for his lack of “white 
people food” – and finally called 
out as a “chink.” The pilot perfect-
ly paints the conflict between the 
devotion to the American Dream 

and the Chinese ideal of “family 
first,” especially when Eddie’s par-
ents defend their honor and their 
children first.

Though the writing too explic-

itly relays exposition at points, it 
certainly has a humorous flair, 
which is even funnier if you under-
stand the occasional Chinese 
inserts. If developed in future 
episodes, the grandmother char-
acter could become more than an 
outlet for one-liners – and more as 
a platform to discuss the junction 
between generational cultures.

Refreshingly, Eddie’s mom, Jes-

sica (Constance Wu, “Stephanie 
Daley”), does not fall prey to the 
hackneyed “tiger mother” persona 
stereotypical of a Chinese parent 
on television. Rather, she embod-
ies a candidly portrayed mother 
who is tough on her children, but 
only to bring out the best in them. 
Wu relays an admirable vulner-
ability that allows us to reflect 
on how our parents’ tough love is 
purely out of care.

Meanwhile, Eddie’s narrative 

voice depicts him as an endear-
ing (albeit ignorant) character, 
with resemblance to the insight-
ful but naïve Scout Finch from 
“To Kill a Mockingbird.” How-
ever, unlike the youthful nuances 
Scout offers, Eddie’s voice is auda-
cious in speech but semantically 
meek. Just because the narration 
is from a child’s point of view 
does not mean the show cannot 
dig deeper into racial issues. Nev-
ertheless, 
Eddie’s 
shallowness 

demonstrates the difficulty of lim-
inality between cultures – he’s not 

comfortably Chinese, but also not 
quite accepted as purely American 
either. In this manner, the series is 
able to expound upon the cumber-
some navigations around discrim-
ination.

Ultimately, 
the 
series 
has 

commendable intentions to dis-
play a different side of race, but 
these lofty goals inevitably carry 
the burden of representation 
for the entire Asian community 
in America. Unfortunately, in 
their attempts to debunk Asian 
stereotypes, they place other 
pejorative generalizations onto 
Caucasians. In the show, the rest 
of white society is portrayed with 
a quasi-acceptance of diversity, a 
xenophobic undertone that over-
simplifies Caucasians as myopic. 
The white women are stereotypi-
cally shallow housewives with 
pretty-face facades, while other 
white individuals are played with 
scripted crudeness. While it is 
crucial to highlight the struggles 
Asian-Americans face, the show 
does not need to equate Caucasian 
ignorance to idiocy. The series 
should aim to enlighten instead of 
to place pointed blame.

When buying perfectly pack-

aged Lunchables to help her son 
fit in, Eddie’s mother asks him, “So 
you want to fit inside a box?” Like-
wise, the show tries to break out-
side the walls of sitcom tropes that 
are running dry. Just as Eddie’s 
father epitomizes the importance 
of constantly improving and tak-
ing risks, “Fresh off the Boat” has a 
premise with potential to be grow 
deeper and develop.

It’s Shonda’s world, 
we’re just living in it

By JORDYN KAY

Daily Arts Writer

I would like to consider 

myself a resident of Shondaland. 
I know I’m not on one of her 
three shows that air every 
Thursday, but I’ve been there 
from the start for all of them. 
Ask any of my friends what 
I’m doing on a Thursday, and if 
they know me at all, they’ll tell 
you I’m sitting in front of my 
television watching three hours 
of 
Shonda-made 
television. 

Shonda Rhimes has become a 
phenomenon.

I started watching “Grey’s 

Anatomy” when it first came 
out in 2005. I was only 12 years 
old. Some may argue this show 
was inappropriate for a 12-year-
old, but it’s was what led me to 
my Rhimes obsession.

But what is it really that 

had myself and so many others 
counting down the weeks until 
the return of #TGIT Thursdays? 
Why is it that I’m so enthralled 
with these shows that I forget 
I’m able to fast forward through 
commercials on my DVR? For 
me, it’s the realness of the 
emotions and characters that 
lures me to come back week 
after week.

Many shows have simple 

characters. 
Simplicity 
often 

mean heroes and villains, good 
and bad – but not in the shows 
Rhimes creates. Her characters 
have depth, and even more 
than that, they struggle to find 
what is right. These characters 
are believable, and the shows’ 

return last week made that even 
clearer than ever.

In “Grey’s Anatomy,” Derek 

and 
Meredith 
don’t 
simply 

end their marriage because 
Derek has decided to go to 
Washington, D.C. – they decide 
to fight for their relationship. 
However, at the same time, the 
audience is forced to recognize 
that both of these characters 
are flawed. Derek and Meredith 
have 
made 
mistakes, 
and 

Shonda holds no reservations 
in pointing this out. She has no 
problem making her characters 
real, even if that reality looks 
ugly.

In 
early 
episodes 
of 

“Scandal,” Olivia Pope seemed 
to 
be 
fearless. 
Though 
it 

appeared like nothing could 
bring her down, she slowly 
unraveled 
throughout 
the 

next few seasons. In the most 
recent episode, while she’s held 
captive, we see a side to Olivia 
that is not just Gladiator Olivia, 
but a weakened Olivia. This 
Olivia is one with a myriad of 
emotions, not just Olivia Pope 
wearing her white hat. She’s 
evolving as a character, and the 
show is even stronger for it.

That is truly the beauty of the 

shows created by Shonda. Her 
ability to force viewers to not 
solely care about the characters 
on her shows, but to become 
emotionally invested, is what 
makes us become addicted to 
her shows. “How To Get Away 
with Murder,” “Scandal” and 
“Grey’s Anatomy” have me 
returning every week because 

Shonda Rhimes has managed 
to evoke emotions I didn’t 
know I was capable of feeling, 
even though the characters are 
fictional.

“How to Get Away with 

Murder” features a similarly 
complicated 
and 
fascinating 

female 
lead. 
As 
Annalise 

Keating turns on her own 
husband, helping to cover up 
his murder, I see a desperate 
woman who I know is breaking 
the law. Regardless, I feel for 
her. I am able to empathize and 
sympathize with a fictional 
woman who I have never met. 
That is why these shows bring 
back viewers each week. It 
is because of the emotional 
connections that we are forced 
to bond with these characters, 
and we count down days and 
weeks until the next episodes.

I’ve always been emotionally 

invested in the characters in 
book and television shows, 
following 
along 
with 
their 

stories and feeling what they 
feel. 
That’s 
because 
they 

provide me with an escape. 
For three hours each week, 
Meredith Grey, Olivia Pope 
and Annalise Keating are real, 
emotional people. I am able to 
forget my troubles and focus 
on their lives. After all, it has 
always been the purpose of 
television and books to allow 
an escape into a world that 
isn’t your own. Shonda Rhimes 
allows us to escape into worlds 
with 
characters 
that 
have 

multiple layers, and she does it 
better than most.

Where did Fraser go?

By BRIAN BURLAGE

Daily Arts Writer

You saw him as a large, goril-

la-like caveman. You saw him as 
a volcanologist hurtling toward 
the center of the earth. You 
definitely saw him as a quippy 
adventurer warding off accursed 
mummies in the heart of Egypt.

But perhaps you saw him in 

the Oscar-winning film “Crash” 
or the movie adaptation of the 
beloved children’s novel “Ink-
heart.” Maybe it was in “G.I. 
Joe: The Rise of the Cobra” or 
in 2003’s live action “Looney 
Tunes: Back in Action.”

If you’ve seen a movie in the 

last 20 years or so, chances are 
you’ve seen Brendan Fraser. He 
looks like a typical Hollywood 
actor: tall, blue-eyed, strong-
jawed, long brown hair. While 
he’s not particularly striking or 
imposing, the subtle air of awk-
wardness and silliness that he 
produces in his performances 
makes him, somehow, memora-
ble, endearing, even.

In the span of 23 years, Bren-

dan Fraser has performed in 48 
feature films. Of them, 18 were 
fantasy-adventures. 
The 
rest 

were some variation of com-
edy, and a few dramas here and 
there. He’s been once nomi-
nated for the Saturn Award for 
Best Actor, twice nominated for 
the Blockbuster Entertainment 
Award for Favorite Actor, twice 
nominated for the Chicago Film 
Critics Association award for 
Most Promising Actor and, as 
part of the ensemble cast for the 
movie “Crash,” won the Screen 
Actors Guild Award. His films 

have garnered over $2.5 billion 
in the box office.

Brendan 
Fraser 
undoubt-

edly fulfills each of the major 
archetypes that would (in any 
other case) distinguish him as 
a highly successful movie star. 
He’s got looks, he’s prolific, 
award-winning, 
he’s 
carried 

several mega-franchises and his 
films consistently make a ton of 
money.

And yet, for all his charm 

and proven track record, Fra-
ser seems to have disappeared 
from cinema in recent years. He 
rarely appears on talk shows and 
his cameos are fewer and fewer. 
Oddly enough, the few success-
ful movies he has made in the 
last few years – “Escape from 
Planet Earth” and “The Nut Job” 
(both generic kiddie flicks) – did 
almost nothing to restore his 
leading man status.

Even 
more 
oddly, 
Fraser 

hasn’t done anything that would 
normally jeopardize a famous 
actor’s reputation. He’s avoided 
controversy, politics and bad 
relationships all together. He 
speaks fluent French, serves 
on the Board of Directors for 
a 
non-profit 
humanitarian 

organization 
called 
FilmAid 

International and he’s even 
a 
well-respected 
amateur 

photographer. In other words, 
he’s the same talented, fun-
loving actor now as he was in his 
blockbuster days.

So where is Brendan Fraser? 

What happened to George of the 
Jungle? The slayer of pharaohs? 
The actor who didn’t – couldn’t – 
make a huge flop or stir any kind 
of anger in Hollywood or self-

destruct?

Most would say, “Well, the 

truth of it is he just got old. Age 
and movie star status don’t cor-
relate. He must’ve aged out of 
the spotlight.”

To them I would answer: he’s 

the exact same age as James 
Bond star Daniel Craig. He’s 
only two years older than two-
time Academy Award nominee 
Jeremy Renner and he’s only got 
Bradley Cooper beat by six years. 
Meanwhile, Fraser’s three years 
younger than Robert Downey 
Jr., five years younger than Brad 
Pitt and seven years younger 
than George Clooney. Age has 
little to do with it.

But others would say, “Oh, 

he’s done too little in the past 
few years.”

He made six films in 2013.
Still others would say, “Oh, 

he’s done too much in the past 
few years.”

He made one movie in 2012 

and one in 2014.

The Brendan Fraser Puzzle 

(as it should be called from now 
on) is troubling. The numbers 
and the context don’t add up: he 
should be as popular today as he 
ever was. In light of the relative 
success of his most recent films, 
in light of the fact that he was, 
and still is, a fantasy-adventure 
Hollywood staple and in light of 
the fact that he practically lives 
and breathes the same spirit of 
enthusiasm that he portrays in 
his movies, Brendan Fraser’s 
gradual slip from the spotlight 
just doesn’t make sense.

And so, sadly, the question 

remains: Where in the world is 
Brendan Fraser?

Michigan hopes 
to find continued 
success over MSU 
in East Lansing

By BEN KIM

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

swimming and diving team 
started 
out 

this 
season’s 

rivalry 
competition 
the 
way 
it 

wanted 
to. 

In their last 
meet, 
the 

fifth-ranked 
Wolverines 
rolled over No. 
12 Ohio State 
(2-1 Big Ten, 
9-1 
overall), 

183-117.

With 
the 

Big Ten season coming to a 
close, Michigan (5-0, 9-0) has a 
chance at an undefeated season. 
It would mark the Wolverines’ 
fourth unbeaten record in a row, 
the fifth in seven years under 
Michigan coach Mike Bottom 
and the program’s 27th overall.

The 
only 
thing 
standing 

in the way is in-state rival 
Michigan State (0-3, 4-5). The 
Spartans are coming off a loss to 
Oakland and haven’t recorded 
a win since Nov. 23 against 
Northwestern.

By the numbers — including 

its 84-5 all-time record against 
Michigan State — Michigan 
shouldn’t 
have 
a 
problem 

winning this weekend’s meet 
and 
finishing 
the 
season 

undefeated. But despite having 
such an impressive accolade 

within reach, it isn’t the main 
focus for Bottom and his squad.

“I think each meet is an 

opportunity for the guys and 
gals to get better,” Bottom said. 
“Being undefeated is very good, 
but I don’t believe that these 
guys look at it as an undefeated 
season.

“With MSU, it’s about going 

in and swimming fast in their 
pool, a pool that has had a lot of 
history. These guys are going to 
be looking at that record board. 
Being able to go in and put your 
name on the board, it’s nice. 
We’re gonna make sure that 
some of those records fall.”

Bottom is specifically hoping 

for his underclassmen to step up 
against the Spartans, because 
they have never competed in 
McCaffree Pool before.

With the regular season 

coming to a close, the Big Ten 
Championships aren’t too far 
off. It comes as no suprise that 
the Wolverines are going to 
approach this week’s meet a 
little differently in preparation.

“At the Big Ten meet, each 

swimmer is allowed to swim 
three 
individual 
events,” 

Bottom said. “A lot of times, 
that third event doesn’t get a lot 
of practice, because in big dual 
meets, someone has to swim in 
his top two events. (This week) 
we might put him on a different 
event, maybe an event that he 
doesn’t swim normally, but one 
he could score in the Big Tens. 
If we’re gonna win the Big Tens, 
we have to score in as many 
events as possible.”

With Michigan State, the Big 

Ten Championships and even 
the NCAA Championships in 
mind, Michigan will be looking 
to close out rivalry competition 
and the regular season with a 
win.

Wolverines ready
for second season

By MITCH BECKMAN

Daily Sports Writer

Standing at the center of a 

brightly lit Oosterbaan Field 
House, 
Michigan 
women’s 

lacrosse coach Jennifer Ulehla 
watches her players confer with 
one another during a break 
from 
their 
end-of-practice 

scrimmage. 
The 
defense 
is 

walking through how it just 
gave up a goal, the offense 
detailing what led to it.

At every opportunity of last 

year’s inaugural season, Ulehla 
urged the young team to learn 
from its experience. Whether 
it was a win, a loss or a goal in 
practice, she wanted the team 
— which consisted entirely 
of freshmen — to grow both 
as players and individuals to 
become the foundation for a 
championship program.

With every starter returning 

from last year’s team, the 
Wolverines are poised to do 
just that. They opened last 
season 0-8 with some losses by 
significant margins. Michigan 
finished its last nine games with 
a 4-5 record, playing noticeably 
better down the stretch. This 
season, the quest to build a 
national contender continues.

“Last 
year 
we 
were 

trying to work on building a 
championship 
foundation,” 

Ulehla said. “And that’s what 
we’re going to continue doing 
this year. We’re still trying 
to get better each and every 
day and develop leadership 
throughout the squad.”

On the offensive side of 

the ball, Tess Korten, Anna 
Schueler and Jess Angerman 
all return as sophomores to 
lead the assault. The trio led the 
team in scoring and controlled 
the offensive rhythm of “Team 
One,” particularly in the second 
half of the season. Sophomore 
midfielders 
Kim 
Coughlan 

and Madeline Dion also made 
significant contributions last 

season and should repeat that 
this year. Couple that with 
several 
freshmen 
who 
are 

expected to contribute, and 
the Wolverines will pack a 
formidable punch on offense.

“We can only worry about 

ourselves,” 
Schueler 
said. 

“There’s a lot of new roles we’re 
all adapting to and starting to 
click a lot better. We’re a new 
team. We’re a better team.”

Defensively, 
Michigan 

is 
coming 
off 
an 
up-and-

down year. The goals-against 
decreased toward the end of 
the year, but the defense was 
still marred by several rough 
performances. 
Sophomore 

goalie Alison Silber played all 
17 games last season and will 
be back in the cage this year, 
looking to perform at a higher 
level. After an entire year of 
playing together, the defense in 
front of Silber should be more 
disciplined and consistent as 
well.

One of the major motifs of 

last season was challenging 
the team, and Ulehla did that 
through a rigorous schedule 
that included five top-15 teams, 
including two games against 
then-No. 10 Ohio State.

This 
season, 
the 
team 

will be seeing plenty of top 
opponents again, squaring off 
with traditional power Florida 
in its first game, while seeing 
four more top-20 teams in 
conference play in Penn State, 
Ohio State, Northwestern and 
defending 
NCAA 
champion 

Maryland.

“The expectation is to get out 

there and get better every day,” 
Ulehla said. “We want to be as 
competitive as possible. It’s one 
of the best conferences in the 
country, and we’re going to try 
and surprise some people.“

The inaugural season of Big 

Ten lacrosse will undoubtedly 
be a challenge for “Team Two,” 
but Wolverines wouldn’t want it 
any other way.

WOMEN’S LACROSSE

Tough games start ‘M’ season

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Defeating No. 1 Florida, the 

2014 NCAA national champi-
on, will be no easy task for the 
Michigan softball team. But you 
wouldn’t be able to guess that 
from the Wolverines’ attitude.

“They’re 

wearing Flori-
da across their 
chest,” 
said 

sophomore 
right-handed 
pitcher Megan 
Betsa. 
“But 

we’re 
wear-

ing Michigan 
across 
ours. 

That’s 
what 

we 
have 
to 

remember.”

Added 

senior 
right-

handed pitcher Sara Driesenga: 
“They are the national champi-
ons, but that was 2014. Now it’s 
2015.”

The Wolverines will also 

face Illinois State, Hampton 
and South Florida at the USF 
Softball Classic this weekend in 
Tampa.

Florida got the better of 

Michigan in the 2014 season 
opener, 
defeating 
the 
Wol-

verines, 9-4, in extra innings. 
Though the Gators have had the 
more recent success, Michigan 
boasts an 8-4 all-time record 
against its SEC opponent. All of 
those wins came under Michi-
gan coach Carol Hutchins, who 
is beginning her 31st season at 
the Wolverines’ helm.

Florida returns 14 players of 

its 20-player roster, and Michi-
gan will likely face the talents 
of right-handed pitcher and first 
baseman Lauren Haeger, as well 
as second baseman Kelsey Stew-
art.

Haeger is coming off of an 

impressive season, posting a 
1.79 earned-run average and 
hitting 20 home runs, the sixth 
most in the country. Mean-
while, Stewart garnered first 
team All-American honors in 
2014, leading the SEC with 102 
hits and recording a .438 batting 
average.

Haeger and Stewart were 

both named to the USA Softball 
Collegiate Player of the Year 
Top 50 Watch List.

Then again, Michigan has 

a few names of its own on that 
list: senior left-handed pitcher 
Haylie Wagner, junior shortstop 
Sierra Romero and junior out-
fielder Sierra Lawrence.

Coming off a second straight 

remarkable season, Romero is 
posed to be a significant part 
of the 2015 campaign, and the 
junior captain is ready to make 
an impact.

“I wouldn’t say I’m trying to 

replicate 
anything,” 
Romero 

said. “I’m coming into this sea-
son, I don’t have a batting aver-
age as of right now, I have no 
home runs. I have nothing. So 
I’m coming in with a clean slate. 
I’m just trying to keep it simple 
and let everything else just hap-
pen.”

If Michigan could take down 

softball’s current goliath, it 
would certainly give it momen-
tum to begin the year.

Following 
their 
matchup 

with Florida, the Wolverines 
will complete the doubleheader 
with a nightcap against USF on 
Saturday.

The Bulls have been picked 

to finish third in the American 
Athletic Conference and are 

coming off their third consecu-
tive NCAA Regional appear-
ance.

And there is one thing that 

Michigan and USF have in com-
mon: They were eliminated 
from the 2014 postseason at 
the hands of Florida State. USF 
suffered two losses to the Semi-
noles last May by scores of 2-1 
and 2-0.

Like Michigan, USF returns 

one of its biggest dual threats 
on the diamond: the 2014 AAC 
Rookie of the Year, outfielder 
Juli Weber. The young talent 
was the Bulls’ primary leadoff 
hitter, notched a .363 batting 
average and recorded a .950 
fielding percentage in her debut 
season.

Given its admirable perfor-

mance against the Seminoles in 
2014, USF can serve as a valu-
able measuring stick for the 
Wolverines.

The 
Sunday 
doubleheader 

will 
feature 
games 
against 

Hampton and Illinois State.

Right-handed pitcher Jailynn 

Jackson will be the main attrac-
tion in the circle for Hampton, 
as she was named the Mid-East-
ern Athletic Conference Pre-
season Pitcher of the Year.

The Lady Pirates were select-

ed to win the MEAC Northern 

Division, and they’ll need Jack-
son to do so, as she recorded 143 
strikeouts and 19 wins in the 
2014 season.

Michigan will likely face Illi-

nois State’s ace as well. Regan 
Romshek won 17 games in the 
circle last year, registering a 
2.71 ERA in 214 innings pitched.

The Redbirds were selected 

to finish second in the Missouri 
Valley Conference.

Both matchups could provide 

the Wolverines with an oppor-
tunity to evaluate their success 
against strong pitching cores.

Though four victories would 

be ideal, the weekend contests 
could prove to be valuable for 
Michigan for other reasons. 
As Hutchins explained, she 
is looking to see development 
and hopes that some players 
will carve out their roles on the 
team.

“I hope I get a chance to see 

us get better,” Hutchins said. 
“We certainly would like to 
see some people settle in. We 
appear to have a lot of different 
personalities that can help us, 
and how that’s going to evolve 
is going to take some time. I 
don’t expect to have a settled 
lineup after the weekend, but 
I certainly want to see some 
people come out and perform.”

Size mismatch causes 
problems for Michigan

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

A win was already out of reach 

with less than three minutes to 
play in the Michigan men’s bas-
ketball team’s 72-54 loss to Iowa 
on Thursday.

But senior forward Max Bielf-

eldt was still working, putting up 
a hand to swat 7-foot-1 Hawkeyes 
center Adam Woodbury’s shot a 
few feet from the basket.

The problem was, as it had 

been all game, that Woodbury 
was simply too tall. He regained 
possession of the ball and put it in 
for an easy layup, stretching the 
Iowa lead to 68-47 and reinforc-
ing the message the Hawkeyes 
sent the Wolverines all game 
long: “You must be this tall to win 
this game.”

Behind a rotation that featured 

two 6-foot-9 players in forwards 
Aaron White and Jarrod Uthoff 
to go with Woodbury and 6-foot-
10 center Gabriel Olaseni, the 
Hawkeyes used their size advan-
tage on both ends to suffocate 
Michigan at Crisler Center on 
Tuesday.

And for an undersized Wolver-

ine squad whose tallest player is 
6-foot-9, Iowa’s size mismatch 
created all sorts of frustration.

“With a tall team like that, 

it’s tougher to simulate in prac-
tice, and when you go against 
it, you can’t quite find the same 
things,” Bielfeldt said. “Second-
chance points was one that hurt 
us today. They have a lot of guys 
going in for those second-chance 
rebounds, and we’ve gotta box 
out better, get our men out and 
gang rebound a little better.”

The Hawkeyes outrebounded 

Michigan 33-17, including nine 
offensive boards that they turned 
into 13 points. But that’s just a 
mild representation of Iowa’s 
dominance inside.

While the Wolverines have 

used tip rebounding to overcome 

their lack of size in other games 
this season, that wasn’t an option 
Thursday. When Bielfeldt or 
freshman forward Ricky Doyle 
would try to tip a ball out or to 
themselves, there was at least 
one Hawkeye there, if not two or 
three, to quickly snatch back the 
possession.

“Tapping it around is tough 

when you have three 6-foot-9-
plus guys in there,” Bielfeldt said. 
“Odds are, their hands are gonna 
be right there too.”

The size mismatch carried 

over on both sides of the floor, 
as Iowa’s length generated prob-
lems when it went to zone looks.

Early on, junior guard Spike 

Albrecht was able to use the 
middle of the floor artfully, using 
fakes and jukes in the middle of 
the Hawkeyes’ defense to create 
shot opportunities all over the 
court.

But once Iowa went to the 

zone, its height clogged the mid-
dle to put a stop to Albrecht’s 
creativity and the Wolverines’ 
offense.

Michigan coach John Beilein 

compared the length of the 
Hawkeyes’ zone to that of Syra-
cuse, regarded as one of the 
toughest zone defenses year 
in and year out. With so much 
height in the middle and length 
to stretch the zone farther, the 

Wolverines struggled to get to 
the rim.

But while Michigan was able 

to use sly passing to work around 
the length of the Orange’s zone 
en route to a 68-65 win Dec. 2, 
the absence of junior guard Caris 
LeVert made it harder to counter 
against Iowa.

“They played off Spike just 

enough, and he’s gotta move in 
closer and look like he’s gonna 
shoot it.” Beilein said. “I think a 
big difference is guys that really 
see. Caris LeVert was a guy we 
really got in a lot (against) that 
Syracuse zone. He’s a good passer 
in the zone, or finding people cut-
ting in the zone, and we missed 
that today — his vision.”

Iowa scored 42 points in the 

paint to the Wolverines’ 16, leav-
ing no doubt as to who owned the 
middle of the floor Tuesday.

The Hawkeyes’ emphatic per-

formance inside left Bielfeldt and 
the Wolverines visibly discour-
aged after the game. But for an 
exceptionally young Michigan 
team, the upshot is that Michigan 
likely won’t face a rotation as tall 
throughout as Iowa’s the rest of 
the way.

“We just gotta keep under-

standing that those little defi-
ciencies we show, we have to 
understand how to improve with 
that and move on,” Bielfeldt said.

Michigan set for outdoor 
game vs. Michigan State

By ERIN LENNON

Daily Sports Editor

On January 11, 1922, the 

Michigan hockey team defeated 
Michigan State — then known 
as 
Michigan 

Agricultural 
College — in 
the Spartans’ 
first-ever 
intercollegiate 
contest.

In 
the 

more than 90 
years 
since, 

Michigan 
and Michigan 
State have met 
indoors 
and 

out, 
in 
East 

Lansing, Ann 
Arbor and Detroit. They have 
created a rivalry on ice as good 
as the one on the gridiron, all the 
while building two powerhouse 
hockey programs.

Saturday, two of the nation’s 

oldest and most storied hockey 
programs will meet outdoors at 
the oldest NFL stadium in the 
country — Soldier Field.

Located in Chicago’s South 

Side, just feet from the shores 
of Lake Michigan, Soldier Field 
celebrated 90 years of operation 
last year. Now the home of the 
Chicago Bears, the facility is 
the third-smallest in the league, 
seating 61,500 fans.

The 
Wolverines 
and 
the 

Spartans have played in bigger.

In front of an announced 

113,411 
fans 
at 
Michigan 

Stadium in 2010, the rivals set 
a record for hockey attendance. 
Michigan won the “Big Chill” 
handily, 5-0, thanks to a pair of 
goals each from current NHL 
players Carl Hagelin and Jon 
Merrill.

Thus far this season, the 

Wolverines and Spartans have 
met twice on neutral ice, with 

the season series tied at 1-1 after 
Michigan’s 2-1 loss last weekend 
at Joe Louis Arena.

“We definitely owe State one 

now, so we’re looking forward 
to the game this weekend,” 
said sophomore forward Max 
Shuart. “It’s always cool to play 
outdoor games.”

The Hockey City Classic 

— which also features Miami 
(Ohio) 
against 
Western 

Michigan — comprises several 
pre-game events, including a 
celebrity hockey game between 
NHL and AHL alumni and 
open skates to benefit St. Jude’s 
Hospital.

Saturday will mark the fourth 

time Michigan and Michigan 
State have met outdoors, and 
each boasts a 1-1-1 record in 
three contests prior. The teams’ 
most recent open-air battle 
came last season, when the 
Wolverines fell to the Spartans 
in the Great Lakes Invitational 
consolation game at Comerica 
Park in Detroit.

From the players’ perspective, 

the excitement of Saturday’s 
game has been building since 
its 
announcement 
over 
the 

summer.

“It’s a change in pace,” said 

sophomore 
forward 
Tyler 

Motte. “Guys get excited about 
it this time of year, so it brings 
a little energy. … Come game 
time, it can be hit or miss. If it’s 
bad ice conditions, bad weather, 
how cold it is — sometimes those 
things can come into play.”

The 13th-ranked Wolverines 

began 
preparing 
for 
brisk 

conditions on Monday — during 
the University’s second snow 
day in as many years — when 
they held practice outdoors at 
Buhr Park, the idea being to 
simulate the weather conditions 
the squad will face in Chicago.

“The ice isn’t always perfect,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson. “The wind could be a 
factor, who knows. We just have 
to be acclimated a little bit so 
there’s no surprises.”

In the “Duel at the ‘D’ ” last 

Friday, the Spartans were able 
to shut down the nation’s No. 
1 offense with a system that 
forced the Wolverines out of 
the middle, where they were 
trapped 
along 
the 
boards. 

Michigan will look to put more 
bodies in front of Michigan State 
goaltender Jake Hildebrand, 
who was lights-out.

“Part of scoring goals is going 

to the net,” Berenson said. “If 
you’re not going to the net, if 
you’re not really battling to get 
there, you’re not going to score 
goals on anybody.

“We have a long laundry list 

of things we need to do.”

To do that, the coaching 

staff 
will 
change 
up 
the 

forward 
lines 
once 
again, 

moving sophomore forward JT 
Compher over to the wing for 
the first time since October, 
pairing him with Motte and 
junior forward Andrew Copp 
on the first line.

Last year’s points leader, 

Compher 
— 
a 
native 
of 

Northbrook, Illinois, a suburb 
of Chicago — has just four goals 
and nine assists this season.

“One thing he won’t have 

to do is think,” Berenson said. 
“Right now he’ll fit in better 
with his linemates. JT’s playing 
really well in recent games, and 
I think he’s going to take that 
game to the first line.”

Saturday’s contest will also be 

the fourth of a five-week stretch 
away from Yost Ice Arena. The 
Wolverines have played just 
five road games since sweeping 
Minnesota at home on Jan. 10.

“Sometimes in the back of 

your mind, you kinda wish 
you were just back here at Yost 
playing a game,” Motte said.

‘M’ earns first win in East Lansing since 2001

By MINH DOAN 

Daily Sports Writer

EAST LANSING — Michigan 

women’s basketball coach Kim 
Barnes Arico sat down in her seat 
on the Wolverine bench with 
about 
a 

minute left 
in the game 
and looked 
out onto the court.

Her team had just held off its 

in-state rival, Michigan State, 
and won in East Lansing for the 
first time since 2001.

And 30 minutes after the 

game, Barnes Arico was still 
riding the excitement of the 
historic win.

“I’m still holding my breath,” 

Barnes Arico said.

In early January, Michigan 

(6-5 Big Ten, 14-8 overall) 
utilized a suffocating full-court 
press to force 24 Michigan State 
turnovers en route to a 74-65 win 
at Crisler Center.

One month and a short trip up 

I-96 later, the two teams were at 
it again Thursday night in East 
Lansing at the Breslin Center.

This time, the script was 

a little bit different, but the 
result stayed the same as the 
Wolverines triumphed, 72-59, 
over the Spartans. The win 
marked the Wolverines’ first 
season sweep of the Spartans 
since the 1999-2000 season.

Michigan scrapped the full-

court press just six minutes into 
the game, but it didn’t matter, as 
Michigan State (3-9, 11-12) shot 
just 33.3 percent — 26.1 percent in 
the first half — and scored just 21 
points, its second-lowest scoring 
output in a half this season.

But even with their poor 

shooting, the Spartans almost 
completed the comeback.

Once 
down 
22 
points, 

Michigan State found life with 
about 11 minutes remaining.

Behind the improved second-

half shooting of forward Aerial 
Powers and guard Tori Jankoska, 
the Spartans were able to cut the 
deficit to as little as six points. But 
that was as close as they got, as 
Michigan did just enough at the 
end of the game to hold them off.

“We knew it was only a matter 

of time before they got good 
looks,” Barnes Arico said. “Our 
kids did a great job of sticking 
together, holding together and 
making plays down the stretch 
when we needed to.”

The first half, though, was a 

completely different story.

An 
almost 
six-minute 

Michigan 
State 
scoring 

drought, 
coupled 
with 

a 
Michigan 

20-2 
scoring 

run, gave the 
Wolverines all 
they needed in 
the game.

Early 
on, 

senior forward 
Cyesha Goree 
had her hands full inside with 
forward 
Becca 
Mills. 
Mills 

held Goree to just three points 
and three rebounds before two 
fouls forced Spartan coach Suzy 
Merchant to sub her out. Without 
Mills on the floor, Goree thrived 
inside, scoring four points and 
three rebounds, taking almost 
half the time it took her to post 
the statistics with Mills in the 
game.

“(Mills) 
was 
being 
really 

physical and pushing me out a 
lot,” Goree said. “I just had to 
make sure I was balanced and 
drew fouls and drew a little bit 
more contact.”

The 
first 
half 
also 
saw 

Michigan effectively shut down 
Powers 
and 
Jankoska, 
the 

Spartans’ two leading scorers. 
Powers was held to six points, 
while 
Jankoska 
was 
held 

scoreless entirely.

“We just denied Jankoska and 

Powers the ball,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We face guarded them the 
entire time, and we said we were 
going to make the other (players) 
have to make shots.”

After combining for 43 points 

the last time the two teams met, 
the Spartan duo was held to 
just 21 points. The poor Spartan 
shooting carried into the start 
of the second half, as Michigan 
State didn’t record a bucket until 
15:46 into the period.

The 
Wolverine 
3-point 

shooting was especially potent 

in the game, as Michigan shot 
50 percent from beyond the 
arc. Sophomore guard Siera 
Thompson finished the game 
4-for-8, while freshman guard 
Katelynn Flaherty finished the 
game shooting 3-for-4. The duo 
finished with 16 and 17 points, 
respectively.

Goree 

finished 
the 

game with 17 
points and 11 
rebounds.

“(Flaherty)’s 

just 
getting 

better 
and 

better 
as 

the 
season 

progresses 
at 

figuring 
out 

how 
to 
get 

her shot off and how to read a 
defense and get open,” Barnes 
Arico said. “Tonight, she shot the 
ball exceptionally well, and she 
didn’t turn the basketball over, 
which was tremendous.”

With the win, the Wolverines 

move back over .500 in the Big 
Ten.

But 
more 
importantly, 

Michigan gained a win on the 
road, where it has won just 
twice this season, and pulled 

out a historic victory over a team 
that has gotten the best of the 
Wolverines in recent years.

“When I first got to (Michigan), 

Michigan State was always the 
team in our state,” Barnes Arico 
said. “For our kids to come here 
and, for the first time since 
2001, sweep them, it’s a great 
accomplishment for our seniors 
and the players in our program.”

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan coach John Beilein 

was upset. Senior forward Max 
Bielfeldt had just been called 
for an offensive foul, and the 
referees 
gave 
an 

Iowa player 
a 
timeout 

as he was falling out of bounds. 
Little did Beilein know, that 
would be the least of his concerns 
on Thursday night.

The Wolverines went the last 

6:58 of the first half without 
a basket while Iowa scored 12 
straight points to hold a 31-19 
lead. Freshman guard Aubrey 
Dawkins 
finally 
broke 
that 

spurt with two free throws, but 
Michigan’s cold shooting and 
inability to solve Iowa’s 2-3 zone 
proved too much in a 72-54 loss.

“They were very, very good 

and 
we 
weren’t 
nearly 
as 

efficient or even close to being 
good,” Beilein said. “It’s for a lot 
of reasons, most of it just having 
a bad day. But (we) were just 
overwhelmed with their timing, 
their talent, their length, their 
size. It was a close game until 
they went zone.”

With the Hawkeyes using 

a 2-3 zone in the first half, 
Michigan (6-5 Big Ten, 13-10 
overall) 
constantly 
had 

issues getting the ball into 
the paint, instead settling for 
contested long-range jumpers. 
Meanwhile, Iowa (5-4, 13-9) 
had no problem getting the ball 
down low, scoring 20 points in 
the paint in the first half and 
42 for the game, in addition to 
outrebounding Michigan, 33-17.

Michigan had faced lengthy 

zone 
defenses 
before, 
but 

without junior guard Caris 
LeVert playing, it was more 
difficult for the Wolverines to 
face the zone without a passer 
like LeVert who can see the open 
man cutting toward the basket.

“I don’t think it’s as much 

about them than us,” Beilein 
said. “This is a good zone, we 

have areas we just have to get 
better at, and some of it might 
be schematic, others just seeing 
the spots that are open, driving 
where you can shoot it. We just 
weren’t efficient. It’s an area we 
need to work at.”

Beilein tried to halt the 12-0 

run before it really ballooned. 
After 
Iowa 
forward 
Jarrod 

Uthoff drove through a wide-
open lane for a dunk with 4:33 
left, he called timeout, but it 
didn’t help much.

Michigan’s 
next 
two 

possessions resulted in airballs 
from junior guard Spike Abrecht 
and sophomore forward Zak 
Irvin. The trend of ugly, off-
balance shots held true until the 
Wolverines’ final possession of 
the half.

Iowa 

forward Aaron 
White 
was 

assessed 
two 

technical fouls 
in the second 
half, with the 
second coming 
after he hung 
on 
the 
rim 

after a dunk. The latter didn’t 
get White ejected, however, 
because it was assessed as a 
Class B technical foul.

Though Michigan managed a 

7-0 run with White subbed out 
and at one point cut the deficit 
down to nine, Iowa answered 
with five straight points.

“We had a little run in the 

second half, and then they got 
one or two offensive rebounds, 
brought it back out, starting 
(to run) their offense, and it’s 
so tough,” Bielfeldt said. “You 
know, it’s like the old Wisconsin 
teams, where we put on a 
36-second shot clock and they 
get that second rebound and run 
their action for 36 seconds. It’s 
not easy to guard.”

Even with Michigan shooting 

better in the second half — 40.4 
percent, compared to 34.8 in the 
first — Iowa proved to be too hot 
for Michigan to handle.

The 
Hawkeyes 
shot 
62.7 

percent for the game and 72 
percent in the second half to 
close out the Wolverines. Five 
Iowa players scored in double 
digits, while Dawkins (16) and 
Albrecht (10) were Michigan’s 
lone double-digit scorers.

Beilein and the Wolverines 

threw a mix of defensive schemes 
at Iowa in an attempt to stop its 
offensive dominance, but unlike 
in past games, there wasn’t an 
in-game fix that could solve the 
problem and win the game.

Michigan was too “average” 

trying 
to 
find 
temporary 

solutions 
to 
the 
Hawkeyes’ 

offensive juggernaut, according 
to Beilein.

While 
Michigan 
suffered 

its worst home defeat since 

December 
2010, a 23-point 
loss to Purdue, 
it didn’t make 
a 
difference 

where 
the 

Wolverines 
played 
the 

game — they 
weren’t 
going 

to win.

“They’re 
a 
really 
good 

team,” Beilein said. “They were 
better than us tonight, without 
question. Home court, away 
court, didn’t make a difference. 
They were better than us.”
