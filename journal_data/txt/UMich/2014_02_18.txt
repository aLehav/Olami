New biology facilty,
Ross renovations
among agenda items
for Thursday meeting
By CLAIRE BRYAN
and YARDAIN AMRON
Daily StaffReporters
After the University's Board
of Regents appointed University
President-elect Mark Schlissel in
January, the regentswill convene
for their second official meet-
ing of the year Thursday. The
regents will be asked to approve
multiple renovation projects, as
well as proposals to create new
administrative positions.
Board to consider new
biological sciences building
The most expensive item
on the agenda is the proposed
construction of a new 300,000
square-foot Biological Science
Building,which will come at an
estimated cost of $261 million.
The proposed structure will

be built in place of the historic
North Hall and the Museums
Annex, which, if approved,
would require the demolition of
both buildings. A connection to
the Life Science Institute would
also be created to take advantage
of the building's dock and vivar-
ium-animal research-services.
The new building will super-
sede the needs served by the
nearby Edward Henry Kraus
Building - built in 1915 - that
houses the departments of
Molecular, Cellular, and Devel-
opmental Biology (MCDB) and
Ecology and Evolutionary Biol-
ogy (EEB).
The action plan states the
Kraus Building has "reached its
limit in terms of ability to allow
contemporary research and the
number of researchers it can sup-
port."
An estimate given in the plan
has both departments relocated
into the new BSB by 2019. New
research laboratories, offices,
classrooms and vivarium servic-
es will allow "for much greater
collaboration than what can be
achieved in the existing build-

CAMPUS LIFE
Lecture looks
into inequality
at universities

Panel discusses
studies examining
how income affects
student decisions
By JACK TURMAN
Daily StaffReporter
As student organizations
rally on campus for diversity
and inclusion, a panel discuss-
ing the inequality ingrained in
organizational structures at
universities across the nation
took place at Lane Hall Monday
evening.
The panel was based off the
book "Paying for the Party," to-
authored by Elizabeth A. Arm-
strong, associate professor of
sociology and women's studies,
and Laura T. Hamilton, associ-
ate professor of University of
California, Merced.
The discussion included
Armstrong, Elizabeth Cole,
chair and professor of women's
studies, Phil Deloria,*LSA asso-
ciate dean for undergraduate
education and Michael Bast-
edo, associate professor and
director of the Center for the
Study of Higher and Postsec-
ondary Education at the School
of Education.
"Paying for the Party"
examined the results from
Armstrong and Hamilton's
five-year case study where

they immersed themselves in
the college lifestyle by solicit-
ing feedback from an all female
freshman dorm at a Midwest-
ern University. Armstrong and
Hamilton went to this dorm at
certain times of the week and
day to interview freshmen liv-
ing on that floor. After the first
year of the study, Armstrong
and Hamilton left that floor
with the rest of the freshmen
and contacted all 53 females to
get interviewed once a year.
The university in the book
is named "Midwest Univer-
sity" because Armstrong did
not want students and parents
to perceive this university as
the only one with aspects of
inequality.
The event began with Arm-
strong describing her book, fol-
lowed by the remarks from the
panel speakers and questions
from the audience. Armstrong
and Hamilton found that fresh-
men students at the university
who lived in a particular dorm
and floor diverged into three
different pathways that were
caused by the school's organi-
zational framework.
Armstrong's findings indi-
cated that the most prevalent
pathway was the "party" path-
way - a university's organi-
zational support system that
allows students to have the
social experience of college.

Last week, the University's
newest movement revealed its
intentions to eradicate politics
from Central Student Govern-
ment and in doing so, "Make
Michigan" great.
As CSG elections approach,
Make Michigan executives
unveiled their platform Monday
night, touting hopes to increase
campus diversity and reform
student ticketing policies, among
other goals.
The Make Michigan campaign
will center on "five pillars" -
student-focused, safe, diverse,
healthy and innovative. Within
these general themes, there are
specific goals that the candidates
hope to achieve ifelected tooffice.

Kickoff event
organizes petition
to be sent to the
White House
By AMABEL KAROUB
DailyStaffReporter
The fate of the Keystone
XL pipeline lies largely in the
hands of Secretary of State John
Kerry, and many University stu-
dents are encouraging him to
halt its construction.
On Monday night, the Uni-

versity's Environment Com-
mittee of College Democrats,
known EnviroDems, brought
students together in the Union
to raise awareness about the
proposed pipeline.
The proposed pipeline has
been generating significant con-
troversy since the 1,664 mile-
long extension-which would
transport crude oil from Can-
ada to refineries in Texas--was
introduced in May of 2012.
On Jan. 31, U.S. Depart-
ment of State released its Final
Supplemental Environmental
Impact Statement regarding
KXL. Kerry has 90 days from

the release date - until the end'
of April - to make a recommen-
dation to President Obama on
whether the pipeline should be
constructed or not.
At the event on campus, stu-
dents circulated petitions that
will eventually be presented to
the White House. The petitions
will be received sometime dur-
ing the 30-day KXL public com-
ment period arranged by the
Federal Register. This period
ends on March 7.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor), who was also present
at a KXL protest on Feb. 3, was

SLICE 'N DICE

Prof. finds the missing pieces

Roderick Little is the Richard
D. Remington Distinguished Uni-
versity Professor of Biostatistics
in the School of Public Health. He
earned his undergraduate degree
from Cambridge University and
his Ph.D. from the University of
London before teaching at the
University of Michigan. His main
research involves the analysis of
data sets with missing values.
What piece of your
scholarship is the most
important to you and what are
you most proud of?
My main areas are in handling
missing data. So when you have
studies where you're collecting
data of differing values, there are

some things that people answer
questions on or holes in the data
sets. I have one of the first books
on that topic. It's quite highly
cited. I also do work on survey
sampling. Recently, at the Census
Bureau, I was working to set up
a research directorate under the
leadership of Robert Groves, who
is actually the census director
who came from Michigan.
Why are there holes in data
sets?
I ask you a question about
income and you don't want to
answer that question since you
think it's intrusive or some peo-
ple just don't have the informa-
tion readily at hand. Some people

don't respond to a surveybecause
they don't want to be bothered
with the time.
Whyis statistics and
biostatistics important?
Statistics is important because
good decisions rely on having
good information. Having good
information relies on having data
and making good inferences from
the data. Biostatistics works more
on the medical area. There's a
lot of interest in evidence-based
medicine where you try to make
rational decisions based on infor-
mation about various treatments
and biostatistics is really at the
forefront of creating evidence.

Cognitive science major 'U,' city finalize plans for
opens to undergraduates new bike-sharing program

New concentrations
offer diverse options
within multiple
departments
By MAX RADWIN
Daily StaffReporter
Undecided about your major?
Well, the University may have
made the decision a little easier.
In addition to the Health and
Fitness Leadership major that
was created at the beginning of
the year in the School of Kinesi-
ology, the University is offering
a new Cognitive Science major
that is launching this semester.
The Cognitive Science major
is an interdepartmental major,
jointly administered by the
departments of linguistics,
philosophy and psychology.
A cognitive science executive
committee oversees student
progress toward completing
-H

major requirements.
"It doesn't respect depart-
mental or disciplinary boundar-
ies," said Linguistics Prof Sam
Epstein, who is in charge of
the new major and teaches the
gateway introductory course
Cognitive Science 200 with Psy-
chology Prof. Rick Louis. "It's a
multidisciplinary effort."
The major offers four differ-
ent tracks - computation and
cognition, decision, language
and philosophy of mind-and
students select one of them
when they declare the major. In
addition to the major's require-
ments, students must fulfill
course requirements and elec-
tives from their chosen track's
department.
"This is a really fast-emerg-
ing and new multidisciplinary
field of inquiry and we thought
it was important for (the Uni-
versity) to offer training and
education in this field," Epstein
said. "There was no cognitive
science initiative at (the Uni-
H-M

versity) going on. We think it's
a fascinating field of inquiry
about how humans think and
choose, and what rational deci-
sions consist of."
Epstein said the vast num-
ber of post-graduation career
options is one of the benefits of
the new major.
"There's countless fields that
you could end up in, includ-
ing A.L and computer science,
ergonomics, research on multi-
tasking, and a myriad of fields
of inquiry in psychology, in
philosophy, in linguistics and
mixtures of fields," he said. "It
should provide students with a
pretty rich set of career oppor-
tunities."
LSA junior Nathaniel Price,
who is still deciding between
the philosophy and computa-
tion and cognition tracks, said
he is interested in using his
degree to pursue his interests in
machine learning and artificial
intelligence.
"I really want to use my com-
puter science background and
apply it to that, as well as the
cognitive science background,"
he said.
Until he heard about the new
cognitive science concentra-
tion in one of his classes, Price
planned to double major in com-
puter science and philosophy.
"I was going to take a lot of
the cognitive science-y, phi-
losophy courses that the Uni-
versity offers," he said, "Instead
of doing just purely philosophy,
this gave me that chance to
not only take those philosophy
courses I was planning on tak-
ing anyways, but also a lot of
cool psychology classes and to ...
apply some of my computer sci-
ence (credits) to that degree as
well."
The Cognitive Science major
was introduced one semester
after the implementation of the
Health and Fitness Leadership
program in the School of Kine-
siology.

ogy created the new major in

Fourteen kiosk
locations will house
125 'blue bikes' for
members'use
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Three years ago, University
President Mary Sue Coleman
unveiled a $14 million invest-
ment in several sustainability
efforts that would affect both
the University and the city of
Ann Arbor. One of these efforts
included the implementation of a
bike-sharing program.
1n May, this goal will be
realized with the beginning of
ArborBike.
Since August 2013, the Ann
Arbor City Council has been
working in tandem with the
University and the Clean Ener-
gy Coalition, a local non-profit
dedicated to the promotion of
energy-independent communi-
ties, to ensure the program's
success.
This collaboration included
attaining federal, city and Uni-
versity funds to subsidize the
project. From November 2013
through January, the CEC
garnered community involve-
ment for the new program by
hosting an online naming com-
petition. Among the top con-
tenders were A2Go, MiBike
and ArBike, but ultimately, the
service was christened Arbor-
Bike on Feb. 5.
The CEC is now seeking final
approval of its 14 kiosk locations
from the city and the University.
In total, these will house 125
bicycles, or "blue bikes," CEC

Project Manager Nick Helm-
holdt said.
These stations will serve
both downtown Ann Arbor and
the University, with kiosks scat-
tered across the Main Street
area, the State Street and South
University areas, as well as
throughout North Campus and
Central Campus.
Stephen Dolen, executive
director of parking and trans-
portation services, said the pro-
gram will yield a benefit for the
entire Ann Arbor community,
whether they are locals or stu-
dents, faculty and staff and the
University.
"If you're on North Campus
and wanting to get to Central
Campus and not take the bus or
have to walk and the weather's
nice enough, you'll be able to
jump on a bicycle and ride it
from there to here," Dolen said.
LSA freshman Elisabeth
Brennen brought her bike from
home and used it in the fall
semester to bike back and forth
between classes and said she
would gladly make use of acam-
pus-wide bike-share program.
"It ended up not being worth
it to bring (my bike) all the way
from home and then have it be
sitting out to rust in the winter,"
Brennen said. "Having a bike
share program would've been
nice because I only used it once
or twice a week."
Dolen added that faculty
and staff could use ArborBike
to get to meetings quickly and
efficiently without driving and
struggling to find parking. Helm-
holdt added that the bike-share
could act as a traffic deconges-
tant and reinvigorate business in
Ann Arbor.
"One of the key things that'

prevents people from shop-
ping in parts of Ann Arbor is
that, frankly, it's just difficult to
access," Helmholdt said."I'd say
this is a way for lots of people to
access businesses that they don't
necessarily frequent."
Helmholdt added that the
kiosk locations will be final-
ized in the next eight weeks
after officials ensure that the
sites are compatible with one
another. After this, equipment
needs to be ordered, delivered
and installed.
The CEC is also considering a
community bike-building event
in May to foster excitement and
knowledge about the program.
However, this is still in the plan-
ning stages.
The CEC is also working to
finalize prices for ArborBike
membership, which Helmholdt
said will roughly mirror those of
Madison, Wisconsin's program:
$5 for a 24-hour pass and $65 for
an annual pass.
In a September interview
with The Michigan Daily, Bill
Loy, who has owned the local
Campus Student Bike Shop for
50 years, voiced concerns about
the potential of a bike-share
program, which he said would
"wreck my business."
Dolen said ArborBike might
actually increase business for
local bike shops, adding that in
all the printed material he has
read on bike-sharing, none have
mentioned detriment to bike
stores.
"They complement each
other," he said. "It gets people
into biking. These aren't seen
as long-term rentals. Ours are
point-to-point. You ride it, you
drop it off at the kiosk, and
you're done."

PIPELINE
From Page 1
the main speaker at the event on
Monday. Irwin said he strongly
opposes the building of the pipe-
line because of its long-term envi-
ronmental consequences.
"What Keystone XL represents
is making a long-term investment
essentially calcifying our commit-
ment to the dirtiest forms of ener-
gy," Irwin said. "We need to stop
this big investment, because this
big investment is going to tether
us to fossil fuels."
LSA sophomore Trevor Dolan,
EnviroDems co-chair, said the
meeting was a kickoff to a cam-
paign to raise KXL awareness on
campus.
"When the report about the
Keystone XL pipeline came out,
we realized that there were a lot of
protests going around nationally
and in Ann Arbor specifically, but
there wasn't really a campus pres-
ence, and we felt like that needed
to happen," Dolan said. "This isn't
something that a lot of students
would be conscious of, but it's defi-
nitely something students would
feel strongly about."
LSA senior Sonja Karnovsky,
EnviroDems co-chair, said she
hopes to bring EnviroDems
together with other environmen-
tal groups on campus to spread
student awareness on KXL. Kar-
novsky and Dolan co-wrote a
viewpoint on KXL for The Michi-
gan Daily on Feb.12.
"We're really hoping to turn
this into a collaborative effort
among different environmental
groups on campus to ensure that
students who have some interest
in environmentalism are aware
of this pretty important devel-
opment," Karnovsky said. "This
is really a seminal moment that
the President and the Secretary.
of State can take to reaffirm the
goals of the environmental move-
ment and ensure that people can
continue that battle."

us to be able to enact our change."
Both candidates said they
believe their experience in student
government gives them a strong
advantage in the race, given their
pre-existing relationships with
administrators and knowledge of
CSG's inner workings.
Under Dishell and Business
senior Michael Proppe, CSG presi-
dent, student government has
enacted numerous resolutions
to increase student input on the
Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities, in addition to
implementing the Night Owl bus
route and engaging in talks with
Athletic Department to change

the unpopular student seating
policies at football and basketball
games.-
Make Michigan will look to
expand upon these initiatives if
elected to office. Specific objec-
tives include revamping the
Michigan smartphone applica-
tion, expanding the Night Owl bus
route to run every night, improv-
ing off-campus lighting, increas-
ing minority enrollment through
partnership with the Alumni

Software approved by gov. for hosptial use

AlertWatch Inc.,
a student startup,
created for operating
room procedures
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
Daily StaffReporter
Nearly three years after its
inception in 2011, a Univer-
sity startup named AlertWatch
Inc. has been approved for the
sale of its first product in the
medical market. The U.S. Food
and Drug Administration gave
its approval for the operating
room software on Feb. 11.
AlertWatch is a monitor
software for operating rooms
that was developed to improve
situational awareness and
patient safety. In a dashboard
display, the product consoli-
dates patient history, physio-
logical monitors and lab values
to create an easy-to-read sum-
mary of a patient's status.
AlertWatch CEO Justin
Adams, a University alum,
described the product's com-

prehensive light display and its
potential to create a safer oper-
ating environment. The system
uses color cues as part of its
display: green as good, red as
bad and yellow as somewhere
in between.
"The idea is to take all of the
data and all of the signals and
recognize that there's a limit to
what people can comprehend,
and we want to make it very
obvious when problems are
happening," Adams said.
The Office of Technology
Transfer paired Adams with
the two founders of the com-
pany in spring 2012. Anesthesi-
ology Department Chair Kevin
Tremper has been piloting
the innovation under his own
supervision for the past two
years.
Driven by his interest in
patient safety, Tremper found-
ed the program alongside
James Bagian, former NASA'
astronaut and current director
of the Center for Health Engi-
neering in the department of
anesthesia.
After Bagian left NASA in
1995, he became both the Vet-

erans Health Administration's
chief patient safety and sys-
tems innovation officer and
the director of the VA Nation-
al Center for Patient Safety,
and has since transferred this
patient safety focus towards
developing and marketing the
new product.
In a press release published
Feb. 11, Tremper contrasted
old medical technologies with
those of the future.
"Forty years ago, we used
the familiar wavy lines - EKG,
heart rate and blood pressure
- to monitor our patients,"
Tremper said. "Today, we're
still using the same wavy lines,
but we have all of this other
patient information digitized
and available. I wanted a tool
that helped put all of that back-
ground patient information in
context with everything else
going on live in the operating
room."
In addition to the University
Medical Center, the software is
being used at the University of
Vermont and the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville. Adams
said feedback remains the most

positive among newer prac-
titioners, and that his biggest
focus at the present moment
is convincing less enthusiastic
clinicians that the product will
significantly improve the qual-
ity of their care.
A statistic displayed on the
homepage of AlertWatch's
official website, cites a study
performed at the University,
which found that 85 percent
of clinicians agreed that the
product meets its ultimate
goal of improving patient safe-
ty.
Currently, the company is
targeting large training hos-
pitals whose incoming practi7
tioners, fellows, and residents
are more likely to be accepting
of newer technological innova-
tions. Adams said the anesthe-
siology community is tightly
knit, which helps the company
spread its message.
"It's a pretty small commu-
nity, meaning that our found-
ers do socialize with a lot of the
potential buyers, so I feel like a
lot of hospitals that would be in
a position to buy it know about
it," Adams said.

To market the product, the
company is pursuing addition-
al funding. Currently, sources
from the larger Ann Arbor
community and from the Uni-
versity have sponsored the
product. Ann Arbor SPARK,
an organization that supports
new businesses and economic
development, has taken an
interest in the new product,
as has the Ross School of Busi-
ness, which finances the soft-
ware through the Zell Lurie
Commercialization Fund.
Adams said the AlertWatch
team hopes to have spread
their product across the mar-
ketplace within the next couple
of years. To broaden the soft-
ware's applicability outside of
the operating room, the team is
currently working on creating
an ICU version of the product,
which would utilize the same
methodology in a different set-
ting.
"I think the goal is really to
get out there and tell the story,
show people what it does and
just convince them that it will
help them runa safer operating
room," Adams said.


INEQUALITY
From Page 1
historically "easy" majors pro-
moted the party pathway.
Armstrong said some of the
women she studied saw college
as a place to constantly have fun.
These students' parents agreed
with their child and viewed col-
lege as a"consumption product."
"(The students) valued the
social stuff right from the start,"
Armstrong said. "It is the case
that there are at least some fam-
ilies who actually don't really
expect their kids to learn that
much in college."
Armstrong and Hamilton
found that certain residence

halls, specifically with rich,
white females, can funnel these
students into sororities, which
contributes to the lack of diver-
sity in certain clubs and activi-
ties.
The second pathway is the
professional pathway, which
included advantages to a student
because of their socioeconomic
status that usually led to a pro-
fession in law or medicine.
While their study indicated
that the professional pathway
had its benefits, it showed that
there was a downside to this
pathway, due to parental influ-
ence. The women who Arm-
strong and Hamilton studied
consisted of upper and upper-
middle class females whose
parents strongly influenced the

student's academic decisions,
such as deciding a major.
"The parents were provid-
ing a lot of the advising that one
wouldn't imagine the school
should do," Armstrong said.
The third pathway is the
mobility pathway - the orga-
nizational pathway that levels
the field among all students, no
matter what the socioeconomic
status of the student. Armstrong
said this mobility pathway was
hidden because of the organiza-
tional framework and parental
influence on students.
According to their studies,
Armstrong said these three
pathwayspose challenges touni-
versities who want to increase
diversity on campus. The main
problem discussed at the panel

was how to improve the ability
of low-income students to get on
the professional pathway.
To achieve this goal and to
combat this problem across the
nation, Armstrong said univer-
sities can schedule more classes
on Friday and maintain a high
standard of academic rigor.
Challenging courses decrease
the likelihood of easy majors
contributing to the party path-
way.
"That right there takes out
a whole night a week of party-
ing," Armstrong said. "There
has been research that suggest
that there are fewer emergency
room visits by simply requiring
students to be in classes. It uses
the classroom space of the uni-
versity more effectively."

While Deloriasaid he believes
there is overlap between struc-
tures described in the book and
at the University, he added that
the University can combat this
issue with living learning com-
munities and its academic pro-
grams.
"We've got a number of pro-
grams that echo professional
pathways," Deloria said.
LSA senior Kaitlin Keane,
an residence advisor for female
honors students, said she sees
students on certain pathways,
especially the party pathway
because of Greek Life. She
added that this Greek Life sys-
tem provides comfort and a
sense of belonging to freshmen
women.

The University's ROTC pro-
gram, which occupied North
Hall, has already been temporar-
ily relocated to the Chemistry
building in anticipation of the
expected construction, and will
be moved again to the Kinesiol-
ogy Building once construction is
completed. The School of Kinesi-
ology will in turn be moved to the
Kraus Building.
Architecture firm Smith-

contractor, was recommended to
design the project.
Ross School ofBusiness to
undergo renovations
On Thursday, the regents will
vote to approve renovations of
the Kresge Business Administra-
tion Library, the demolition of the
Computer and Executive Educa-
tion Building and construction of
new academic buildings near the
business school.
Exterior building finishes will
be added to Sam Wyly Hall, the
Hill Street Parking Structure
and the Business Administration
Executive Dormitory to create a
unified look for the Ross School of
Business-which received its last
update in 2013with a $100 million
gift from University alum and real
estate mogul Stephen Ross.
Therenovations willadd faculty
and research offices, classrooms,
and study spaces to the complex.
The project is also set to provide
155 on-site construction jobs.
There will be a temporary loss
in parking during construction,
but no permanent impact on park-
ing once the project is completed.

The project is estimated to cost
$135 million, all of which will be
funded by donations.
Last September, real estate
mogul Stephen Ross donated
another $200 million to his name-
sake Business School and the Uni-
versity Athletic Department.
The board will approve the com-
missioning of the architectural
firm of Kohn Pedersen Fox Associ-
ates PC to design the project.
In response, the regents voted
in their October meeting to
rename much of South Campus
as the Stephen M. Ross Athletic
Campus.
In November, the board
approved the construction of a
new building on the Stephen M.
Ross Athletic Campus, creating a
space for maintenance shops and
offices, equipment storage and
laundry, as well as shipping and
receiving operations.
Board to consider Presi-
dent's Residence renovations
The board will also consider a
$1.3 million renovation of the his-
toric President's Residence, fund-
ed from investment proceeds.
Since the construction of the
original President's Residence
in 1840, the home has under-
gone four significant additions,
increasing its size from 4,800 to
14,000 square feet total.
The residence is the old-
est building on campus and has
maintained its historical heritage
despite undergoing many main-
tenance projects, with the most
recent one occurring in 2002.
The board will vote to replace
the flat roof surfaces that are
more than 25 years old; repaint
exterior areas; repair damaged
wood, masonry and stucco;
replace two heating ventilations;
renovate three bathrooms and the

kitchenette on the second floor;
and install storm windows in the
first-floor study.
The alarm and fire detection
system will be updated to a mod-
ern system with additional warn-
ing devices and a fire protection
sprinkler system. The stone walk-
ways will be leveled and damaged
stones will be replaced.
The regents will also vote to
approve the continuation of the
fund that provides furniture, rugs
and other miscellaneous items for
the house. Currently, this fund is
approximately $100,000 and if
approved will increase to a total
of $250,000.
The project will be overseen
by the University's Department
of Architecture, Engineering and
Construction.

West Quad, Union renova-
tions to be approved
Plans to renovate West Quad
and the Michigan Union are push-
ing forward, as the regents plan
to open the project to bids and
award construction contracts.
In July, the regents approved the
initial schematic for the 370,000
square-foot renovation as the
final installment of the Residen-
tial Life Initiative.
The $114.5 million renovation
will convert West Quad's din-
ing hall into community, creative
and practice space and streamline
dining services into South Quad's
expanded Central Campus Din-
ing Center, which is expected to
open in the fall.

response to the large num-
ber of alumni who were
going into corporate well-
ness and personal training,
or opened their own fitness
businesses after gradua-
tion.
The new major requires
classes focusing on a vari-
ety of different subjects,
including sports manage-

ment, physical education
and movement science.
Students will also take
some business, sports law
and management classes.
"This is reallya response
to a worldwide need," said
Pat Van Volkinburg, asso-
ciate dean for academic
programs at the School of
Kinesiology. "What's hap-
pening is there are three
major problems: people are
getting heavier, they're less
active and they're getting
older and this has a nega-

tive influence on the econ-
omy. Michigan is a leader.
We decided it was time that
we added a new major that
meets the needs not only of
our students, but to busi-
nesses of the world."
The structure of the
major prepares students to
take the American College
of Sport Fitness Instruc-
tor the National Strength
and the Strength Coach's
exams upon graduation -
a benefit that was not built
into any other Kinesiology

majors before this year.
Despite not appearingon
the checklist of majors list-
ed on the Common Appli-
cation this past year, the
new major been popular in
its first semesters.
"I'm getting phone calls
from kids who are juniors
in high school, people from
other schools and col-
leges across the country
that want to transfer in, so
word of mouth is getting
out there," Van Volkinburg
said.

Cultivating the economy
Farm bill will improve Michigan agricultural sector
n Feb. 7, President Barack Obama signed the 2014 farm bill at
Michigan State University in East Lansing. The farm bill, formally
the Agriculture Act of 2014, eliminates direct subsidies for all
commodities that are produced except cotton, but increases and extends
subsidized crop insurance to help preserve crop prices. The president
insisted that the bipartisan legislation is not just about helping farmers
but boosting the economy as a whole. The 2014 farm bill is expected to
save about $24 billion over 10 years, compared to the current agricultural
budget. However, the bill cuts $8 billion dollars from the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program. Overall, the new farm bill is set to enhance
the agricultural economy in states such as Michigan - one of the nation's
largest and most diverse farming economies - but will be detrimental to

SNAP beneficiaries.
According to the Michigan Department
of Agriculture and Rural Development, the
food and agriculture industry contributes
$91.4 billion to the state's economy every year.
Michigan's agricultural industry produces
more than 200 types of commodities on a
commercial basis and employs 923,000 people
in the state's workforce. Michigan ranks
second in the United States in terms of crop
diversity and is also a leader in specialty crops
such as apples, cherries and sugar beets. Since
specialty crops have been garnering increased
interestunderthe newbill, Michigan is atarget
for larger research funding.
The 2014 farm bill links agricultural
practices and land conservation. For the
first time since the original farm bill was
enacted in 1933, the federal funding assigned
to conservation - approximately $56 billion
- exceeds the present commodity subsidies,
which is approximately $44.4 billion.
Farmers are able to access natural resources
to produce healthful and homegrown
foods that contribute to air, water and soil
conservation in Michigan. This provision is
especially important to Michigan farmers, as
preservation.agreements make up about three
percent of the state's total farmland.

Though the bill is necessary for economic
revitalization, its cuts are hazardous to those
in need. The 2014 farm bill will reduce SNAP's
funds by $8 billion. Much of the savings from
the farm bill are in part due to these cuts.
These cuts will affect low-income households
in 15 states and the District of Columbia. A
total of 850,000 households will experience
a cut of about $90 a month in aid. Though
this is minimal compared to the Republican's
proposed $40 billion cut, the impact on families
who depend on SNAP is substantial. Further
action.needs to be taken by the administration
to ensure that adequate aid is provided to
people in need.
East Lansing was the perfect place for
Obama to sign the landmark legislation. MSU
is a pioneer land-grant college, established in
1855 as the Agricultural College of the State
of Michigan. MSU continues to maintain a
tradition of excellent agricultural studies
program and is a leader in bio-based research
and development. While the University isn't an
agricultural school, research in chemical and
biological engineering may indirectly impact
the state's agricultural industry. Supporting
agriculture is vital to Michigan's economic
health and recovery.

Imagine being so afraid that the
contents of your stomach try to force
themselves out through your throat,
burning your insides and causing
biting tears to spill from your eyes.
Imagine spending a day marching
peacefully alongside your fellow class-
mates, protesting your right to basic
freedoms. And imagine that peaceful
protest met with violence. Imaginethe
police, the National Guard, shooting at
you as you run away. Imagine clutch-
ing your phone as if it were providing
you with oxygen, waiting to hear if
your family is safe or if they were one
of the casualties. Imagine being faced
with a choice: stay silent and accept
that you are living in a nation where
your rights are violated on a daily
basis, where you have no freedom of
press or speech, or go out and pro-
test, but face serious injury and death.
Imagine hearing your president blame
you for the violence, imagine having
him shut down media organizations,
so you have no way of knowing what
is going on in your country. Imagine
having soap operas playing on every
channel while college students are
being shotat outside your door.
What you're imagining is reality for
my country.
Last weekend, in Venezuela,
various protests over worsening
economic conditions rocked some of
the nation's largest cities. The protests
were met with a bloody crackdown
executed by government officials
and their supporters. Many peaceful
protesters were taken and put in jail,
and treated as criminals. This takes
us to Wednesday, Feb. 12, El Dia de a
Juventud (DayofYouth).
Popular opposition leaders
Leopoldo L6pez and Maria Crina
Machado had organized a peaceful
protest in Caracas, supported by
university students and a host of
other organizations.
The protest continued peacefully
early in the day, and people began to
return to their homes around 1:30
in the afternoon. At about 2 p.m.,
however, the attacksbegan.
Police, military and colectivos -
armed groups of civilians trained
by the government - converged en
masse on the main plazas and streets
of several cities. Two students and
a member of one of these armed
groups were killed during the attacks.
Almost 70 were wounded, and almost
as many were detainedbygovernment
officials. Friday, it was reported that
the arrestedstudentswerectorturedby
the same officials that were supposed
to protect them.
That night, or perhaps in the early
hours of Feb. 13, the government
released an order for the arrest of
L6pez, one of the opposition leaders.
L6pez has not been seen since the
arrest warrant was issued, though he
MAURA LEVINE|
St
Winter 2014 is one of those winters
we'll always remember. The polar-
vortex-style cold is compounded by
constant precipitation and it seems
that, even if you're wearing two
sweaters and a scarf, you're always
freezing on the walk to class. "Have
you fallen yet?"has become acommon
question in a conversation between
friends who haven't seen each other
in a few days. At the beginning of one
of my classes, my professor suggested
we get special cleats for the bottom
of our boots to keep us from falling.
Given the frequency of slipping

and sliding on the way to class, I'm
surprised I have not seen more of
those. While the campus crews have
been hard at work, it seems they can't
quite keep up. The University, as
well as private businesses and local
residents in Ann Arbor, need to take
measures to step up their sidewalk-
clearing game to keep everyone safe.
Ann Arbor has a city ordinance
requiring that "non-residentially
zoned property owners or occupants"
must clear the snow and ice from their
public sidewalks every day before
noon. Sidewalks must be treated "with
sand, saltor other substance to prevent
it from being slippery," and the city
even provides residents and property
owners with one 5-gallon bucket of
snow-melting substances to aid in
meeting this requirement. Residential
area owners are also required to
remove snow and ice within 24 hours
of snow accumulation. Residents
are urged to report violations of
the ordinance to the community
standards unit of the Ann Arbor Police
Department, and violators can receive
a $500 fine for their noncompliance.
Tattling may not the best solution,
but people have been falling and get-
ting hurt from these slippery condi-
tions. This past week alone, two of
my roommates fell on ice and got
large and painful bruises that physi-

has remained active on Twitter. His
last public appearance was at 10:30
p.m. Wednesday night, on a CNN en
Espafiol interview with Fernando del
Rinc6n. Representatives of his party
have come out and stated that L6pez
is at home, analyzing the arrest order
withlawyers.
L6pez's absence, as well as the side-
liningof other politicalleaders,has left
the organization of the protests to stu-
dents. The movements that occurred
Thursday and Friday were completely
organized by university students; no
politicians participated in or orga-
nized any of them. Thursday's pro-
tests were much more disorganized,
however, and violence erupted on both
sides. Many of the protestors criticize
those on their side who responded to
violence with violence, advocating for
the continuation of peaceful dissent.
Aside from the protests
themselves, the government
has imposed a near-total media
and information blackout. The
government's tightening grip on
media has existed for years prior to
theprotests (forinstance,Venezuela's
oldest TV channel, RCTV, was closed
down in 2007), but is growing in
intensity. Late Wednesday afternoon
at about 4 or 5 p.m., NTN24 was
taken off the air by Conatel, the
government-owned media regulator,
and by executive order of venezuelan
President Nicolis Maduro. NTN24 is
based out of neighboring Colombia
and was the only major television
network covering the protests in
Venezuela. Since then, there has
been no information outside of social
media and a few websites that give
insight into what has been occurring.
Venezuelans are relying on Twitter,
e-mail and text messages to get their
information, since their government
has censored their media.
This is what is happening in
Venezuela right now.
Here's the thing: as terrifying as
the photos and videos of the protests
circulating are, as horrifying as it
wouldbeforyoutoreadinexcruciating
detail the acts of violence that are
occurring in Venezuela's streets,
what's more important is why these
protests are happening to begin with.
In the wake of former president Hugo
Chivez's death, Maduro, Chivez'sheir
apparent, won the election byjust over
1 percent of the overall vote. There
is no majority rule; there is barely a
democracy. We have moved past a
division of ideologies. This isn't about
right versus left, or even us versus
them. It's about freedom. It's about
being granted the basic human rights
that come with living in a democratic
nation: freedom of speech, freedom of
press, freedom to voice your opinion
without fear of being kidnapped,
attacked or killed. It's about security;
iaring the shox
cally limited them for several days.
It's apparent that much of the danger
is due to private businesses' and indi-
viduals' failure to shovel their por-
tion of the sidewalk. The slush from
the perpetual snow storm has turned
into a thick layer of ice, and there is
always new snow on top of that. These
conditions are disastrous for anyone
trying to walk to class. The Diag area
is usually completely cleared, but the
corner of Willard Street and East Uni-
versity Avenue, for example, is one of
the worst. On my way to class in East
Quad, I personally saw two people fall

at this corner. It's shameful that the
local businesses haven't taken the ini-
tiative to shovel their sidewalk areas.
This corner, and many others
like it, technically don't constitute
"campus." Considering that many
of these areas are close to campus
property - less than 10 feet away -
it's ridiculous that campus facilities
haven't been going the extra mile to
keep these areas salted and safe. For
example, students walking from the
Diag to East Quad encounter a block
of unsalted, unshoveled sidewalk
simply because it isn't legally Univer-
sity property and the University isn't
officially responsible for cleaning it.
Granted, it is the job of the local busi-
nesses to take care of their sidewalks.
But if they aren't goingto do it, some-
one has to. Is the University really
going to leave these areas unsafe?
The entire point of snow removal is
to keep students and faculty safe on
their commute to campus buildings.
When entire patches of snow and ice
are not touched for more than four
days because they aren't legally on
campus property, the rest of the snow
removal effort is pointless since Uni-
versity members still have no choice
but to cross this hazardous terrain.
Ann Arbor is a college town. Most
people walking around the campus-
downtown area are students or fac-

it's about living free of fear, it's about
not having to worry if you will have
a gun pointed at you today, it's about
being able to leave your house knowing
you will be safe. It's about not having a
president claim he can communicate
with Chivez through little birds.
It's hard to imagine this if it isn't
happening to you, so let's bring it
home. You're living your everyday
life as a college student in the Unit-
ed States of America. Recent events
have created a deep divide in your
country, and the new president of
the U.S. gained power with barely 50
percent of the vote. The losing party
asked for a recount, due to the close-
ness of the election, and was denied.
You spend a year living under this
new government, and things have
only gotten worse. The government
controls the media. The streets are
full of violent crimes. Every time you
leave your house, you wonder if you
will be facing down the barrel of a
gun. You breathe a sigh of relief when
your house gets robbed, because at
least it wasn't your life they took.
The United States now has one of the
highest murder and inflation rates in
the world. Basic supplies like toilet
paper and milk are hard to find. Res-
taurants experience a lack of water.
Power outages occur sporadically
throughout the nation. You are tired
of the insecurity, of the failing econ-
omy. You are angry at the fact that it
costs your family in nearby countries
thousands of dollars for a plane ticket
(if they can even find one) to visit you.
You want things to get better. So, you
and virtually every college student
in every major city decide to go out
and protest peacefully. And you are
met with tear gas. You are beaten to
the ground. You are shot in the back.
You carry your bloody friend out of
the line of fire, tears streaming down
your face. The vision of the pool of
blood that formed on the street, the
bright red drops that stained your
shoes will haunt you for the rest of
your life. You scream as your friend,
your brother, your sister, your cousin
gets dragged awayby"officials," only
to be tortured for exercising their
rightto speak out in peaceful dissent.
You are unarmed, and those who are
meant to protect you attack you. You
survive, just barely. And you go out
the next day to do it all over again.
So, what can you do? Spread
the word. Use Facebook, Twitter,
Tumblr, Instagram, Vine, texts,
calls, Snapchats, word of mouth. Tell
everyone and anyone of what is going
on in Venezuela. We have freedom.
Let's speak up for those who don't.
Mi Venezuela, t Venezuela,

ulty. It would be nice to think that
all local businesses, the University
facilities responsible for cleaning
the "campus area," and residents
with public sidewalks would all care
enough about their fellow Michigan-
ders to clear the sidewalks and make
them less dangerous. It would not
take much time if everyone did their
part and cleared their portion of the
public sidewalk when the snow first
fell so that it did not turn into impos-
sible-to-remove ice patches. Their
liability for not only benign bruises,
but for broken bones, god-forbid,

should be weighing heavily on their
conscience. For the sake of the elder-
ly and disabled, snow removal is even
more important than a neighborly
obligationbut a neighborlynecessity.
Some may argue that the recent salt
shortages and the extreme nature of
these conditions have made it hard to
keep up with snow removal. In this
case, I propose that the University put
up warning signs near slippery areas,
and attend to those areas as soon as
they appropriate the resources. They
could even close off potentially injury-
threatening areas to the public until
more salt arrives to remedy the situ-
ation. Instead, the corner of Willard
and East University has remained cov-
eredwith athicksheetofice,traversed
by hundreds of students a day, for this
entire past week. I would assume that
is enough time for local businesses or
campus facilities to obtain salt and
apply it to the sidewalks, though we
are still waiting for that to happen. In
any case, when the conditions are haz-
ardous to our health and well-being
the University should be doing more
to protect us from getting hurt on our
daily commute, and residents should
step up and take the initiative to pro-
tect their fellow Ann Arborites in the
struggle against Winter 2014.

Made of ire

I wish I could tell my skin that it is made of
fire. That it covers blood and bone and muscle
no different in makeup from Jennifer Lawrence
or Michelle Obama or Emma Watson.
I wish I could tell my skin that it exists as a
covering for what is pulsing within my body,
that it has been designed to keep me safe, and
that anyone who cares more about wrapping
paper than what it contains inside is a fool.
And I am learning that even the people
who love me can be foolish.
I am trying to come to peace with
something I never used to cry over.
I am trying to tell my skin, I am trying to
tell myself, I am trying to tell my mother and
my family and whoever I want to love me that
I am more than my color.
But I am my color, too.
My skin is not a shade an Indian mother can
be proud of, my skin is the color of cinnamon
and peeled-back tree bark, and my skin never
used to make me ashamed.
I am dark. My father is darker, could
probably pass for Black if his features were
not so unmistakably Indian. My mother, on
the other hand, is fair. I never had a problem
with being dark when I was younger - my
father's sister is darker than he is. I thought
her skin glowed, it was so black. I thought
she was the most beautiful woman I had ever
seen. I used to sit out in the sun so my skin
would grow to be like hers. And I laughed at
that Indian standard of beauty, sure I would
never care about the shade of my skin.
But then I turned fifteen, and I sat in a room
while my great-uncle demanded to know why
my two-year-old niece, whose skin is far, far
fairer than mine, was "so terribly dark." He
thundered this at my uncle in a tone both angry
and disapproving, and I shrunk back into a
corner and tried to disappear and learned for
the first time that being brown could make me

feel small.
I was twenty and listening as my great-
aunt told my mother that I was looking a bit
nicer now that I at last looked fairer (living
through two Michigan winters will do that to
you). Most painful of all, I had to listen to my
mother tell me she agreed with my aunt, that
she thought fairer was prettier as well. This
from a woman who married a man so dark
his complexion isn't just shades darker than
hers, it's at the bottom of an entirely different
paint swatch. What did that say about what
she thought of my father? What did that say
about what she thought about me?
I know they say beauty is only skin deep.
But we want even that thin layer of skin to
be wholly accepted by the people we love,
regardless of its color.
When I tell white Americans that Indians
prefer fair skin, they inevitably ask me, in a
tone half disapproving and half slyly pleased,
"Oh, so like ... they want to be my skin color?"
I used to think it was my duty to sweetly
answer these condescending questions. I do
not think so anymore.
I do not want to be your skin color. I want
to be my own. And I want to be comfortable in
it, the same way I was when I was a child and
didn't notice that no one Iread about in books
or saw on television looked like me.
I want my mother and the mothers of
other Indian girls I know, smart, educated
women who love and want the best for their
daughters, to stop caring about the color of
our skin.
Let us play outside if we want to.
Let us get darker, let us develop.
We are more than the shade of brown we
are labelled by.
Let us understand that we are made of fire.

At the end of the day, season
two never really surpasses season
one. It's not that the show lacks
ambition - with its multiple
interconnecting subplots,
powerful cinematography and
daring story direction, it boasts
ambition that rivals Frank
Underwood's. (Okay, maybe not
Frank Underwood's, but you get
the idea.) And its failure to rise to
greater heights isn't necessarily
even a bad thing. Season one was
fine good television, and this
new season managed to replicate
everything great about it without
coming off as rehashed material.
Season two's just not going to
convince any naysayers either. By
now, the show is content with its
faults. It takes its time (perhaps
a little too much time) and treats
many characters like pieces
in a game rather than people
worth developing. If watching
politicians, businessmen and
lobbyists connive and backstab
doesn't appeal to you, the show
isn't about to cater to you to get
you to binge watch all 13 new
episodes. Again, it has an attitude
of no regrets. Season two'sjustnot
worth your time.
other than that, season two is
by all means a success. "House of
Cards" isn't a show for everyone,
but it's hard to deny its quality. It's
even harder to deny its confidence
in its characters, its cast and
its story direction. And so even
though it's not perfect, it still
makes for excellent television.
"Welcome back," Frank
Underwood says to conclude the
season's first episode. It's great to
be back, indeed.

For my 11th birthday, I had
a party at Zap Zone. I invited
girls and guys, but only one
boy came. He felt lost in

left before I opened the rest
of the presents. He felt sick,
he said. I watched him bolt
to his mother's car,.sprinting
faster than any sick person
I'd ever seen.
I had sat behind him in
history that year, which led
to a strong fascination with
his dark hair and scratchy
handwriting. I had a crush,
and as I clutched the paint
set on my way home from
the party, I vowed to make
him something, anything, to
show I took his present seri-
ously.
I started trying to emulate
Picasso, in hopes of thrilling
him with my knowledge of
cubism (which was incred-
ibly lacking) and C6zanne,
because I remembered loving
Curtains when I saw it in a
dusty art book. I tried paint-

everything I ever drew, and
I never ended up painting
anything for him. He moved
away a few years later.
When I was 13, I had an
English teacher who would
check our homework reading
for margin notes, and look
us in the eyes when he found
something unsatisfactory.
He would bend close and
say "this makes me want to
weep," and then we'd blush
and hide our shame in the
next day's homework, filling
the margins with notes that
we hoped meant something.

"Part of
getting in, is knowing when
to get out!" Bernie (Kevin
Hart, "Ride Along") tells the
romantic lead, Danny (Michael
Ealy, "Takers"). The ebb and
flow of the script redounds
with that cynical relationship-
sniping that only best friends
can get away with. Hart's
character plays the proto-
masculine sex machine who
tries over and over to talk
Danny off the monogamy train.
He talks about relationships
in terms of entrapments and
emasculations. "Fake your own

unlike the usual romantic

have counted to three, and said
it at the same time?" The banter
ranges from political to pop-
cultural, but it's always fast and
on-point. There's scarcely an
off-beat in the entire hundred
minutes, and plenty of one-
liners worth pocketing for use
outside the theater.
Bernie's relationship
amounts to full-fledged
insanity. In his first big fight
with Joan (Regina Hall, "Law
Abiding Citizen"), he tells some
ridiculous yarn about being
Jewish, and as he recounts the
situation to Danny at the gym,
we witness some of the best
comic chemistry ever to grace
a squash court. Even when he's
not onscreen, Hart's energy is
the lifeblood of this movie. His
relationship with Danny takes
the movie to a warm place in
every "bro" heart.
Every exchange between

Danny and Ernie is as pure as
the driven snow. From "Star
Wars" references to "Man, I
can't believe you dropped the
Jew bomb!," the pair epitomizes
that larger-than-life movie
friendship that makes your
heart hurt because you never
had one like it.
The main problem with
the film is that their beautiful
Los Angeles apartments, their
bodies, their social circles,
are all incredible - literally
unbelievable, such that an
observant audience can tell that
this movie is 90 percent fairy
tale. Especially since Danny's job
supposedly sucks, and even when
he quits to take a financially
worse job, he can somehow still
afford his magical apartment.
The characters' jobs become a
theme: their jobs can make them
feel romantically unviable, and
Danny addresses this emotional

baggage as something coming
between him and Deb.
The entire script is riddled
with these light romantic blows
of want, expectation and stress
that sneak into relationships and
eat us alive. Deb releases some
of this stress by tossing a fully
furnished turkey out of a fourth
story window. There's another
problem: that was simply out-
of-character for her. Sensible
people don't throw turkeys out of
fourth-story windows.
The story ends in medias
res. We don't know whether
both couples last or if either
couple lasts. The tension doesn't
altogether release, but it's okay.
It's the only thing about this movie
that's perfectly realistic. We're
left with Kevin Hart's charming
admonitions, "Why do we have to
do what everyone else does?" and
"Who says we even have to get it
right at all."

Consistent Curren$y Anticipated shows of 2014

New mix tape
drives right into
our hearts
By JOSH FRAZIER
DailyArts Writer
Consistency from musicians is
a valuable trait, and Curren$y's
latest release The Drive In The-

ability. Over
a luxurious The Theater
soundscape, Curren$y
one of rap's
best storytell- Jet Set
ers depicts an
expensive life-
style filled with money, orga-
nized crime and weed. These
familiar tropes are not new to
Curren$y's music; the Jet Life
Recordings rapper has spent
years perfecting his laid-back
aesthetic. TheDrive In Theatre is
one of his strongest releases yet.
Curren$y gives his best Martin
Scorsese impression, directing
a modern-day urban crime film
through clever wordplay and
a well-organized score. "The
Godfather" samples sprinkled
in amidst the elegant production
make Curren$y's latest mixtape
true to its name, a cinematic
experience.
Curren$y picks up where he
left off following a prolific 2013
in which he released four mix-
tapes and an EP with fellow
stoner Wiz Khalifa. The Drive In
Theatrereboots SpittaAndretti's
trademark flow, which manages
to sound both intricate and lazy
at the same time. His complex
rhyme scheme makes rapping
seem effortless, and this new-
est mixtape bolsters Curren$y's
reputation as one of the stron-
gest lyricists in rap today.
Incredibly detailed lyrics
make the usual boasts about
wealth feel fresh, a difficult
feat to accomplish in rap's often
repetitive landscape. Curren$y
sets the scene for his rhymes
with visual lyrics, giving the
mixtape a . movie-like feel.
Album stantlout "E.T." opens
with the line "Fresh paint on

sunlight of the morning / Under
the shade of the trees taking it
all in." The visceral track also
features Cypress Hill's B-Real,
who spits his best verse in
years, inspired by Curren$y's
engaging lyrics and magnetic
personality. Other can't-miss
tracks include the lead single,
"Godfather Four," and the hyp-
notic "Hi Top Whites," which
demonstrates just how cool
Curren$y can be.
If Curren$y is the director of
The Drive In Theatre, its undeni-
able star is the lavish produc-
tion. The mesmerizing beats
weave seamlessly from song to
song, complementing his rivet-
ing voice. Equal parts laid-back
and complicated, production
on the mixtape is handled by
the usual cast of characters.
Weed rap favorites like Cardo,
Sledgren and Thelonious Mar-
tin are all behind the boards
to craft a sophisticated movie
score that allows Curren$y and
friends like Action Bronson,
Freddie Gibbs and members of
the Jet Life crew to go to work.

It's refreshing to see a musi-
cian release one quality project
after another, and The Drive In
Theatre's biggest flaw is that
Curren$y makes it look too easy.
This mixtape is an extension
of his traditional style, sure to
please longtime fans with its
cohesive lyrics, well-curated
beats and selective guests, but
its familiar style likely won't
win Spitta Andretti any new
fans. Although it's easy to dis-
miss him as a one-dimensional
artist, Curren$y has carefully
developed his aesthetic and is
very good at what he does.
The Drive-In Theatre plays
like a soundtrack to Curren$y's
life, perfect to accompany
his favorite activities, which
include cruising in classic cars,
lounging in sweatpants and, of
course, smoking. There is no
better music for a lazy day spent
watching old movies or driving
around town, and Curren$y's
latest release shows that he
hasn't lost a step in the booth,
and will continue to be effort-
lessly cool behind the mic.

2013 was a hell of a year for
television, but for those of you
who are worried that TV's gold-
en age might be on its way out,
here's a couple of new shows
coming out this year that might
just change your mind.
"The Leftovers"
Network: HBO
Premiere: Summer 2014
HBO and Damon Linde-
lof ("Lost") are teaming with
acclaimed writer Tom Perotta
("Election") to adapt his novel
about those left behind dur-
ing the biblical Rapture. I'm a
huge fan of Lindelof and think
he gets way too much unde-
served heat for the finale of his
last religious-allegory/science-
fiction mystery show (and no,
not "Nash Bridges"). This time
the material looks perfect for
Lindelof, whose work always
bridges the gap between faith
and fantasy.
"Believe"
Network: NBC
Premiere: March 16
Alfonso Cuar6n is co-creator
and director of the pilot, which
is more than enough reason
to tune in. The show follows a
wrongly convicted death-row
inmate who is broken out of
prison and tasked with protect-
ing a mysterious girl who also
happens to have really awe-
some superpowers. Network
sci-fi has been a bit soft since
the dearly departed "Fringe"
and with "Marvel's Agents of
S.H.I.E.L.D." turning out to
be more procedural than cre-
ative, "Believe" could reconnect
broad appeal with intelligent
writing and bring back the early
days of shows like "Lost" and
"Heroes."
"The Strain"
Network: FX
Premiere Date: July
FX might very well be the
most underrated network on
television. Hopefully, Carlton
Cuse ("Bates Motel") and the
show's primary creator who will

Del Toro ("Pan's Labyrinth")

could prove to be the "Walk-

ing for. Corey Stoll, best known
for his fantastic but short-lived
role as Peter Russo in "House
of Cards," leads the cast in this
apocalyptic sci-fi drama about
a virus that ravages the Earth,
turning people into vampires.
And in case the word "vampire"
brought Bella and Edward to
mind, I'd like to point out that
this project is coming from the
bizarre mind of Guillermo Del
Toro, the man behind some of
the most terrifying monsters
in movie history (the Thin Man

the potential. Legal dramas are
a dime a dozen, but unlike most,
"Saul" follows the sleazy, mor-
ally questionable defense law-

And with the recent announce-

JOHNS. CHRISTENSEN/JasperSailfin Photography JOHN S. CHRISTENSEN/Jasper Sailfin PHOTOGRAPH
Marshall first heard of his father's death from his cousin Aaron. Incoming recruit Lawrence Marshall suffered the tragedy of losing his father and grandfather in the two months before his senior season in high school.

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
awrence Marshall woke
up on July 13, 2013 ready
to fulfill his high school
community service requirement.,
The Michigan football commit
spent many of his sumner days
doing just that.
This time he noticed some-
thing peculiar: a man in the park
he was cleaning was wearing an
Omega Psi Phi shirt - the same
fraternity his father, Lawrence
Marshall Sr., had been a part of.
The 6-foot-4, 240-pound
defensive end couldn't get
that image out of his head.
Throughout the day, he kept
thinking about his father. Not
for any particular reason, but
even in the most mundane of
times, he returned to that image.
After completing his service,
Marshall went to a family
cookout at his uncle's house.
Several of his friends and closest
family members would be there,
though his father never planned
on not attending.
As soon as Marshall got to the
barbeque he thought of the same
omega symbol. He couldn't get
his father out of his head. He
didn't know why. The image
lingered and lingered.
That's when his phone rang.
Marshall

didn't know what to feel.
"That was the worst day ever.
It was so hard. It was one of
the worst days I've ever had,"
Marshall said.
People coming to the party
looked at him with a peculiar
face. His friends were joking
with him, saying, "Lawrence,
you mad your girlfriend broke
up with you or something?"
But he wasn't saying a word.
After the initial shock had
died down, Marshall asked his
grandma to take him home, and
in the car, he finally broke the
devastating news. He couldn't
muster the strength to go back
to the barbeque even to tell his
mom - his grandma had to do
the painful task.
Lawrence Sr. had shaped
Marshall. He was the one who
introduced Marshall to football
and made him stick with it.
He was the one who helped
keep him disciplined inside the
classroom and out.
But he was gone now Marshall
didn't know what to do. Aaron
was out of town, but he was on
the next flight home.
"It was hard on him, as it
would be on anybody," Aaron
said. "It was hard for me not to
be there for him, but in a way
he needed to deal with it on his

Goree stands out in season of ups and downs

By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Editor
At the top of each locker in
Michigan's locker room, a lami-
nated block 'M' rests right under
each player's name plate. All of
the 'M's are maize, but on two
lockers, the maize is completely
overshadowed by orange basket-
ball stickers.
The stickers represent a
reward system used by the Wol-
verine coaching staff. To those
outside the program, the stickers
may seem akin to a system used in
an elementary-school classroom,
but to the women's basketball
team, they mean the difference
between wins and losses.
The stickers aren't rewarded
for the obvious things needed to
win games - points, rebounds
and assists. Instead, they repre-
sent the things Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico finds most
important, the things that aren't
found in a box score. Each time
a player takes a charge or dives
on the floor for a loose ball, she
is awarded a sticker. Michigan
assistant coach Joy McCorvey
determines the allocation of the
stickers, with Barnes Arico hav-
ing the final say.
"It's kind of really what we
pride ourselves on and what
we stand for

JAMtrnCOLLER/Daly
Junior forward Cyosha Goreo went from playine a totalI of 24 inuates last season to startine every earns this year for he Michigan women's basketball learn

or senior guard Jenny Ryan won
every week. Toward the end of
the season, Goree's name started
to creep toward the top of the list.
"She would win the day,"
Barnes Arico said. "And then she
won a couple of weeks. And I'm
like, golly, Cyesha, what hap-
pened? She's really starting to
make a difference in practice."
When the seniors graduated
and left behind a depleted ros-
ter, Goree knew that the time to
step up was upon her. Her dedi-
cation to her fitness continued
into the offseason as she contin-
ued to trim weight and get into
her best playing shape.
By the time summer workouts
rolled around, Goree finally had
her opportunity to prove her-
self among a new cast of play-
ers. Goree thought she would
likely receive playing time out of
necessity, but she wanted more.
"It was time to show all the
hard work I did and everything
I did to prepare myself for this
moment so that (Barnes Arico)
could believe in me and actually
want to play me, instead of hav-
ing to play me," Goree said.
Goree earned a spot in the
starting lineup by the season
opener. In the team's second
game, she proved she belonged,
hitting a buzzer beater to send
the game against Arizona to
overtime. She hasn't left the
starting lineup since, starting
all 26 games along with her co-
sticker leader Elmblad.
Sunday, Goree put forth her
best effort of the season, record-
ing career highs of 30 points
and 19 rebounds. The little-
used sophomore turned often-
relied on junior earned the Big
Ten Player of the Week award
for her effort. Barnes Arico is
impressed, but not satisfied.
"I still feel as if there's another
part of her game which she has to
improve, and that's on the defen-
sive end," Barnes Arico said.
After all, Goree has improved
before. She has the stickers to
prove it.

after Sunday's game at Illinois, 35

Elmblad's currently holds 31.
Goree's fearless style of play
has allowed her to accumulate so
many stickers that Barnes Arico
estimates she may need a second
'H'shortly.
Last season, she didn't have
the opportunity. On a winning
team with established veterans,
Goree toiled on the bench com-
ing off knee surgery. The forward
appeared in just nine games, reg-
istering 24 minutes of playing
time. Goree hadn't mastered the
consistency both on and off the
court that Barnes Arico desired of
her players. This year, Goree runs
toward the scene of loose balls,
diving for possession without a
second thought.
"She had to really try on being
the basketball player she could be
100 percent of the time," Barnes
Arico said. "She had to try to be

the best student that she could be
100 percent of the time and be the
best person that she could be all
the time."
Goree's up-and-down days
infringed upon her ability to
make an impact on the court. She
showed flashes of success both on
the court in practice and in the
classroom, but there were also
days where Goree didn't show
the effort it takes to be successful.
Goree credits conversations with
Barnes Arico as critical to helping
her realize her full potential.
Because of her prior knee sur-
geries, Goree's fitness wasn't
where Barnes Arico wanted it
to be. Goree made that her first
mission, to improve her physical
fitness, a difficult challenge for a
player who struggled with consis-
tency. Each day, Goree worked to
improve physically, even on game
days, a time some bench players
take to relax.

"If you don't play, that's kind
of like a day off for you," Goree
said. "But I didn't use it as a day
off. I got on the treadmill and ran
a couple miles to try to stay in
shape."
The new, difficult commitment
to fitness didn't result in imme-
diate playing time. Goree main-
tained her role on the practice
team, trying to help prepare the
starters and key players each day
in practice.
In her two years as Michigan's
coach, Barnes Arico has used
another method of competition
to quantify success in practice by
adding up the statistics each play-
er accumulates in practice. The
statistics are updated each day, so
each practice hasa winner. At the
end of the week, the statistics are
totaled, and the team has a week-
ly winner.
For most of last season, either

three wins in its last six contests,
and the Badgers have struggled
on the road.
And having embarrassed the
Wolverines last week, Penn State
proved that its first points in the
Big Ten would not be the only
ones it would earn this season.
Friday, the Nittany Lions took
Michigan State into a shoot-
out, securing a tie and its fourth
conference point. And though
it lost the following night, 2-1,
Penn State held the Spartans to
a single goal for 55 minutes and
just 13 shots on the night - a
performance the team will look
to build upon when it returns to
Michigan.
Like Penn State, Ohio State
stumbled out of the gates in the
Big Ten, dropping five straight to
the conference's top three teams
before stealing a contest from
Wisconsin in Madison. But since
then, the Buckeyes were unbeat-
en for six straight games before
splitting a home series with the
Badgers - a team that swept the
seemingly indomitable Gophers
one week prior.
At this point, Minnesota
represents the exception. The
Gophers now lead the confer-
ence by seven points - a gap that
won't likely be closed before the
Big Ten Tournament.
"I don't know who the top
half is," Berenson said. "It keeps
changing every weekend. These
are all good teams. On a given
night they can beat anyone."
NOTE: Both Sinelli and fresh-
man defenseman Michael Down-
ing have been suspended for one
game, in accordance with the Big
Ten's supplemental discipline
policy. Downing and Sinelli are
ineligible to play in Michigan's
Feb. 21 game against Penn State.

n April 18 last year, for-
wards Glenn Robinson
III and Mitch McGary
had everyone's attention. The
duo announced that they'd
forgo the NBA Draft and return
for their sophomore seasons at
Michigan.
Robinson
in particu-
lar felt that
there was
more to his
game than
what he'd
shown last SIMON
year, and he KAUFMAN
planned on
revealing the
full package in a second season.
This year was supposed to be
his year. He'd come back, lead the
team to another impressive run
in March and then, theoretically,
after having put all his talents on
display, head off to the NBA.
Nearing the end of the Big Ten
season now, that certainly has
not been the case for Robinson.
He's struggled to find a rhythm,
find consistency and on many
nights, find the basket.
In Michigan's 72-70 loss
against then-No. 1 Arizona on
Dec. 14, Robinson played a game
that has epitomized his season.
He shot 7-for-7 from the field
in the first half, including two
3-pointers for 16 points. In the
second half, though, with more
pressure on him from the Wild-
cat defense, he was practically
nonexistent. He took just two
shots in 19 minutes.
It's been the story for him
all season. Save for a stretch of
games during the Big Ten season
when he scored 14 or more points
in each, he hasn't been able to
carry success from one game
to the next. After putting up 23
points in the Wolverines' rout of
Nebraska at home, Robinson fol-
lowed the game with a pathetic
two-point effort in a loss at Iowa,
then just nine points on 30-per-
cent shooting at Ohio State and
10 points in Michigan's loss to
Wisconsin at home.
The struggle has been the
result of poor shooting, particu-
larly from deep. Robinson shot

31 percent from beyond the arc
in conference games last season
- in this year's BigTen contests,
he's shooting just 22 percent
from 3-point range. He's averag-
ing 12.8 points per game on the
season - not a bad figure, but
certainly not what the Wolver-
ines, or Robinson expected when
he announced his return.
Michigan coach John Beilein
felt Robinson was the right man
to lead. The coach selected the
sophomore to serve as one of
Michigan's three captains in
November. Beilein felt that as long
as this was going to be Robinson's
team, the forward should share
the responsibility of leading it.
But ask anyone whose team
this has been this season, and
you'll get a different answer. It's
been Nik Stauskas' team, and
perhaps when Stauskas has had
trouble carrying all the weight,
it's been Caris LeVert's team,
too. When Mitch McGary went
down, upperclassmen Jon Hor-
ford and Jordan Morgan stepped
up, and it was their team as well.
But Robinson's team?
Certainly not.
Despite not living up to the
hype surrounding his return, one
thing is certain, Robinson still
has the potential to be great. His

6-foot-6 frame and raw athleti-
cism give him a higher ceiling
than a Stauskas or LeVert.
Even if he hasn't proven it
consistently yet, Robinson has
shown flashes of what he could
be when everything is work-
ing in sync. It's the reason that
despite Stauskas having betting
numbers, many experts still pre-
dict Robinson could be selected
earlier in the NBA Draft - he has
more of an upside.
That upside will need to show
itself though, if Michigan wants
to make any sort of run in March.
It won't be enough for Robinson
to have one highlight-reel dunk
and then go quieton offense, or
one breakout half and then get
shut down. He'll need to be a
consistent weapon to take some
of the burden off of Stauskas and
LeVert.
For the Wolverines to compete
come tournament time, the real
Glenn Robinson - the one that
said he still has more to prove,
the one that stepped up with
21 points to lead Michigan past
South Dakota State in the first
round of the tournament last
year, the one that makes defend-
ers look silly when he goes past
them for monster dunks - will
need to stand up.

Sophomore forward Glenn Robnison Ill hasn't lived up to expectations yet.
