'DIVEST

Judiciary
invalidates
student gov.

Students occupy the Central Student Government chambers in the Michigan Union Wednesday night to protest the body's decision to indefinitely postpone voti
on a resolution that will call on the University to divest from a number of companies that do business with the Israeli military.
Divest sit-in calls on CSG
to pass stalled resolution

CSJ ruling states
Engineering Council
procedures violated
Constitution
By KRISTEN FEDOR
Daily StaffReporter
Early Wednesday morning,
the Central Student Judiciary
released an official ruling stat-
ing the Engineering Council,
the student government for the
College of Engineering, violated
its own constitution and bylaws
by improperly conducting its
December election.
CSJ ordered the current
UMEC Executive Board mem-
bers to step down and be replaced
by interim officers at the author-
ity of the UMEC General Coun-
cil. Permanent Executive Board
members will be decided in the
upcoming elections to take place
at the same time as the winter
Central Student Government
elections.

Engineering graduate student
Kyle Lady, the Eta Kappa Nu rep-
resentative for UMEC, and Engi-
neering senior Kelsey Hockstad,
an officer of Tau Beta Pi, filed the
suit against UMEC for alleged
undemocratic behavior earlier
this month. Engineeringgraduate
studentMichael Bensonserved as
counsel for the petitioners.
Lady and Benson both said
they were pleased with the CSJ
decision.

Petitioners found a myriad of
irregularities with the UMEC
elections, which took place in
December. According to Article
IV of the UMEC Bylaws, results
should have been released to the
public by Dec. 9. The Michigan
Daily reported on March 10 that
they were given to the plantiffs in
Janurary; however, they have not
yetbeen released to the public.

meet with SAFE
members, CSG
leaders late at night
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
In response to the Cen-
tral Student Government's
decision Tuesday to indefi-
nitely 'postpone voting on a

resolution that would call for
the University to divest from
companies allegedly involved
in human rights violations in
Palestine, more than 100 Uni-
versity students, alumni and
community members came
and went throughout the night
during an "indefinite" sit-in in
CSG chambers Wednesday to
demand a vote on the measure.
Students Allied for Free-
dom and Equality, a pro-Pal-
estinian student organization,
arranged the sit-in and also

sponsored Tuesday's protest in
favor of divestment from com-
panies including Caterpillar,
Inc. and Hewlett-Packard.
SAFE contends that the
companies' involvement in
Israel makes them culpable in
the country's eviction of Pal-
estinians from East Jerusalem,
and do not want their tuition
dollars invested in these com-
panies. CSG postponed a vote
on passing a divestment reso-
lution by a vote of 21-15, with
one abstention.

In addition to demanding
CSG vote on the resolution,
SAFE initially called on CSG
to make all of its meetings
open to the public and to allow
students unlimited speaking
time at meetings. CSG cur-
rently allots 30 minutes for
community concerns, and stu-
dents are individually permit-
ted three minutes of speaking
time.

GOVERNMENT
Dingell, Levin
to leave impact
after retirement

Michigan leaders
established vital
relationships on
Capitol Hill
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor
When Sen. Carl Levin (D-
Mich.) and Rep. John Dingell
(D-Mich.) step aside from their
congressional positions early
next year, there may be more to
forfeit than personal legislative
clout.
With almost a century of com-
bined experience on Capitol Hill,
Dingell and Levin's retirements
could also signal a period of wan-
ing Washington influence for
Michigan. With federal research
dollars and other policy initia-
tives on the line, their retire-
ments have an equally significant
effect on the University.
Aaron Kall, director of the
University's debate team and
expert on election politics, said
the departures would have a last-
ing impact.

"Any time you have such long-
serving members of Congress
retire, it's inevitable there would
be some decline in influence," he
said.
However, clout is difficult to
measure, as connections with
political leaders are difficult to
replace and dependent on per-
sonal relationships. An ear at the
White House or connection to
committee chairs or members of
the leadership carries weight and
provides additional entry points
to trumpet the state's priorities.
Levin has also been a fixture of
the Sunday morning political
talk show circuit - representing
the state on millions of screens
across the country.
"Those things are invaluable,"
Kall said. "Phone calls, commu-
nication could lag a little bit if
those kind of connections are lost
with these retirements."
Cynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-
versity's vice president for gov-
ernment relations, said she is
confident that Levin and Ding-
ell's successors will champion
the state's priorities and it's pub-
lic institutions upon entering

Safelide

New interface will

By KRISTEN FEDOR
DailyStaffReporter
With the help of a new applica-
tion, student SafeRide users now
have the option of orderinga ride
directly from their phone or com-
puter.
The app, called Campus Saf-
eRide, alerts users when rides
are en route and arrive at a pick-
up stop. It launched this past
weekend.
Engineering seniors Andrew
McGrath and Summit Shrestha,
both Computer Science majors,
created the app as a continuation
of a class project they worked on
together.
McGrath was a SafeRide driv-
er for more than a year and said
he noticed certain inefficiencies
with the program - faults he
wanted to fix with the creation
of the app. When presented with

Hveem said they were able
to conduct a longitudinal, pro-
spective follow-up study by col-
lecting data from registries over
many years without having to
physically examine the patients
after their initial registration.
The study design focused
only on differences in DNA
across people that also changed
proteins.
"By looking at that smaller
set of all the DNA changes that
are possible between individu-
als we were able to focus much
more quickly on a specific gene
called TM6SF2," Willer said.
To test their hypothesis that
TM6SF2 was responsible for
changing the blood cholesterol
levels and risk of heart attack
in the Norwegian subjects, the
researchers disrupted the same
gene in mice, either by overex-
pressing it or down-regulating
it.
The resulting effects in the
mice's blood cholesterol levels
were exactly what the research-
ers had expected.
"That was pretty clear evi-
dence that this indeed was the
gene responsible," Willer said.
Both Hveem and Willer plan
to continue studying the gene
in the hope that they may find
a way to design a new drug that
would target this gene in a way
that hasn't been possible before.
Willer said he believes the
same gene might be associated
with fatty liver disease and
plans to research the topic fur-
ther.
They also both said how
rewarding it was to work
together on this project.
"For me, one of the exciting
and rewarding things about this
work is when people collaborate
to do much better science than
they can do by themselves,"
Willer said.

Students rewarded
for writing thank-
you notes to small
contribution donors
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor
The University's Office of
Development distributed thou-
sands of free t-shirts Wednesday
- with just one catch.
To receive one of the blue
shirts with the words "Hail
yeah!" printed across the front,
students were asked to fill out a
postcard thanking an individual
University donor - all of whom
had made small gifts under $50
- for their contribution to the
University.
Around 4,500 students filled
out postcard thank-you notes
and received a free t-shirt at one
of the more than a dozen Hail
Yeah stations located around
campus. The Alumni Associa-
tion and 15 University units par-
ticipated, including multiple
colleges and the office of Finan-
cial Aid.
Kat Walsh, director for stu-
dent engagement at the Univer-
sity's Office of Development,
said the goal of the event served
to remind students that every
gift matters and that alumni
and students can have an impact
even with $10 or $20 donations.
"We're specifically focused
on alumni because we want
students to see themselves as

future supporters of the Univer-
sity," she said. "This is a part of
the Victors for Michigan cam-
paign because we want them to
know they can play a huge role in
reaching the campaign's goals."
Though the Office of Develop-
ment holds the Hail Yeah stu-
dent engagement event annually,
this year's incarnation occurs in
the midst of the $4 billion Vic-
tors for Michigan fundraising
campaign, which launched in
November.
Compared to previous cam-
paigns, Victors for Michigan has
refocused attention on engag-
ing students, both as a means to
encourage donors to give toward
financial aid and to help students
understand the role develop-
ment plays in their experience at
the University.
Walsh said students contrib-
uted to the planning and imple-
mentation of Wednesday's event,
as well as the campaign's kickoff
community festival in November
that drew thousands to Ingalls
Mall for musical performances,
food and giveaways. She said
this level of student campaign
engagement is unprecedented.
"This campaign is really about
creating experiences here on
the Michigan campus for cur-
rent students," she said. "This is
really a way to engage students,
to thank alumni who are part of
the campaign and to thank stu-
dents."
Katy Wallander, assistant
director of student philanthropy,
said student-driven events like
Hail Yeah resonate more effec-

tively with the campus commu-
nity.
"This campaign is really about
creating experiences here on the
Michigan campus for current
students," she said. "This is real-
ly a way to engage students and
to thank alumni who are part of
the campaign."
Walsh said a handout like
t-shirts are another way to thank
students who have contributed
or helped fundraise $1.5 million
for University development.
Beside featuring and engag-
ing students at events, campaign
strategists have placed a fund-
raising emphasis on student sup-
port - with a goal of raising $1
billion dedicated to student sup-
port.
LSA junior Jennifer Sylvester
filled out a thank-you postcard
at one of the tables inside the
Chemistry Building Wednesday.
"I have a scholarship here and
it's really meant a lot to me, so
everything helps to help another
student be able to go here and
have an amazing experience,"
she said.
Though the promise of a free
shirt initially attracted her to
the table, LSA freshman Katie
Washagan said she recognizes
the importance of donors help-
ing to improve the student expe-
rience.
"Without them my experience
wouldn't have been the same -
and it's been incredible so far,"
she said. "Every little bit counts.
It doesn't matter if you donate
even five dollars - I feel like it
will go to something great."

the opportunity to create this
app, he teamed up with Shrestha
to make it a reality.
One of the issues McGarth
hoped to address was the com-
paratively long waits students
often endure for SafeRide to
arrive. With the app, students
can now receive alerts for when
their ride is on its way. This
allows students to continue
working in the library while
they wait, McGrath said, instead
of having to wait outside for long
periods of time.
McGrath and Shrestha
approached LSA junior Emily
Lustig, chair of CSG Campus
Safety and Security Commis-
sion, for help in promoting it the
campus community.

Lustig said the app is an ini-
tiative that will help increase
safety of students on campus.
She said other new initiatives
such as the Night Owl bus have
been helpful in transporting
students who are off campus,
but the SafeRide app will be
more focused on students on
campus.
Lustig also serves as party
chair for Make Michigan, a
party running in the upcoming
CSG elections. She brought the
app to other Make Michigan
leaders to further the collabora-
tive process ofimplementingthe
app.
Public Policy junior Bobby
Dishell, Make Michigan presi-
dential candidate and current
vice president of CSG, spoke
about the work the party did to
help implement Campus Saf-
eRide as part of its campaign

promises.
"We think it's going to make
campus a lot safer, and we're
happy that Make Michigan was
able to help bring this to cam-
pus," Dishell said.
McGrath and Shrestha said
the response to the app has been
positive overall since its launch.
"It's been really great creat-
ing something that we thought
students would like and based
on the feedback, it honed to
what we wanted," Summit said.
Since the launch, they have
already tweaked some features
in response to student feed-
back. McGrath said these minor
changes deal with making alerts
more pronounced and clear.
Students can visit campussa-
feride.com to send in feedback
and get directions on how to
download the app.

their respective positions.
"I'm reluctant to say we're
going to falter," Wilbanks said.
"It's important of course to rec-
ognize we are losing longevity
and very long influence on the
part of two members of the del-
egation. They have been great
friends of the University and
they've always been ready to roll
up their sleeves and work tire-
lessly on behalf of many of the
issues we care about deeply. But
I'm also prepared to say those
who will follow in their shoes are
going to be eager to be effective
as quickly as possible."
She added that the Universi-
ty's government affairs team will
immediately begin developing
relationships with the new mem-
bers, just as they have done with
any new addition to Michigan's
congressional delegation. Wil-
banks said the members of the
entire Michigan congressional
delegation are assets of the state
and its public institutions.
"Of course they have differing
views and many have differing
priorities, but I don't think you
ever want to fail to stay connect-
ed and to be sure that your mes-
sage - the advocacy we think
is important on any number of
issues - is shared with every
member of the delegation," she
said. "How they approach those
policies and priorities is of course
up to them, but we cannot fail in
maintaining and strengthening
every relationship we have."
Wilbanks cited federal
research funding as a top con-
cern. Over the past few years,
the funding was threatened by
sequestration measures. Federal
support makes up 62 percent of
the University's research budget.
Though Wilbanks said Levin
and Dingell have been helpful
in lobbying on behalf of the Uni-
versity's research interests, she

Engineering sophomore Selina

This could have validated Liu's
assumption of the presidential
seat; however, it would violate
Article III of the UMEC Consti-
tution. In the event of a vacated
seat, according to Article III, the
Executive Board should appoint
an interim officer to be approved
by a vote of the General Council.
UMEC did not make any such
motion following Calvo's resigna-
tion. The alleged vacancy of the
seat is still unclear, as Calvo was

URBAN POLICY
From Page 1A
the event.
Located among the foothills
of the Appalachian Mountains,
Youngstown was a center for
steel production until the indus-
try began to decline in the 1970s.
Urban planners have recently
approached the city about look-
ing for ways to redevelop a mid-
sized city from a once larger
metropolis.
Among the program's
strengths, she said, are its vision
of citizen engagement, clearly
written plan, strong institutional
support, ability to create capac-
ity and, most notably, acceptance
of its decline to a smaller city.
However, the program is chal-
lenged by population loss and
decreasing resources, the dif-
ficulty in establishing for whom
the main district exists and
an inability to overcome racial
dynamics.
"There's a lot we can learn
from this plan, there's a lot we
can learn about what a plan can
and cannot do as well," she said.
Dewar introduced the
Youngstown 2010 Plan, which
aimed to involve the community
in enhancing the rapidly shrink-
ing city. This differs from most
urban plans, which generally
focus on community and popula-
tion growth.
Dewar said they had to define
Youngstown's role in the new
regional economy, improve

in UMEC, as they do not pay dues
for the College of Engineeringstu-
dentgovernment.
CSJ ruled the UMEC constitu-1
tion is not in violation of the All1
Campus Constitution. According1
to the official opinion, CSJ said1
graduate students are entitled1
to representation in UMEC as
they are covered by the Collegei
of Engineering. However, gradu-
ate representation should remain
less significant than that of under-
graduates.I
Engineering graduate student
Boying Liu was appointed presi-1
dent of UMEC in the December
elections. This is a violation of
Article III of the UMEC constitu-
tion, which declares that anexecu-
tive officer must be enrolled in the
College of Engineering. Though
an engineering graduating stu-
dent, Liu is technically enrolled in
Rackham, notthe College of Engi-
neering.
Liu, in additionto the otheroffi-
cers, was appointed in an invalid
election accordingto CSJ. Accord-
ing to Article III of the UMEC
constitution, UMEC elections
should be held in conjunction with
CSG elections in November. For
unclear reasons, UMEC elections
did notctake place until December.
Additionally, information regard-
ing candidates has a deadline of
being released at least two weeks
prior to the election according to
Article III. This information was
released to prospective candidates
on Dec. 3, only two days before the
Dec. Selections.
CSJ also ruled the appointment
the city's image and enhance
the quality of life by making
Youngstown a healthier place to
live and work.
Russo, visiting research fellow
at the Virginia Tech Research
Center, was not as optimistic. He
said despite the positive econom-
ic effects of the plan, it has forced
Youngstown residents to realize
the shortcomings in their city.
"There is a type of collateral
damage that happens to a com-
munity, just not economically,"
he said. "Now there is a sort of
physical health problem, sui-
cides, a sense of community
agency, a sense of loss, a feeling
of failure, a loss of pride and a
sense of shame and all of these
things are carrying the commu-
nity."
Russo also argued that urban
planners neglected services and
infrastructure in specific neigh-
borhoods, often those that are
heavily impoverished.
"What happened was that
there were few relocation allow-
ances and there were few resi-
dents who wanted to leave their
home and the neighborhoods
that were targeted for this were
largely African American,"
Russo said.
Hunter Morrison, execu-
tive director of the Northeast
Ohio Sustainable Communi-
ties Consortium Initiative, said
one strategy the urban plan-
ners undertook was integrating
Youngstown State University
with the surrounding communi-
ty. This work was accomplished

of executive board members at
the Jan. 22 UMEC meeting was
an "egregious use of illicit power."
Engineering graduate student
Christine Zuchora, the outgoing
UMEC president, elevated mem-
bers to specific offices to which
they were not elected.
Benson said the removal of the
current Executive Board reflects
more long-term problems within
UMEC that he hopes to help fix.
"The current UMEC officers
really were caught in the middle
of things, and I was really pleased
the court made very clear that
they weren't being held account-
able," he said. "The issues with
UMEC have been long-standing."
In a statement to The Michigan
Daily, members of the executive
board that must step down wrote
they are happy UMEC can now
move on from this case.
"We are looking forward to
UMEC's reinstatement so it can
continue to support the College
of Engineering student body and
its student organizations," they
wrote.
While CSJ did not order a
constitutional convention, both
sides recognized at the hearing
that they were open to reviewing
inconsistencies between UMEC
and All Campus constitutions.
Lady said changes to the
UMEC constitution and bylaws
are still needed.
"Whether it is or isn't in viola-
tion of the all-campus Constitu-
tion, we're going to go through the
same process ofreworkingthemto
serve the students better,"he said.
by a partnership between the
university and the city to develop
the area within a half-mile radi-
us of campus in order to promote
shared spaces.
"As a result of that strategy
we've seen increased investment
and renovation of office build-
ings, housing, restaurants and
the like, so this has become quite
a vital area where ten years ago
it was pretty much empty," Mor-
rison said.
Another problem was vacancy
after the population drop. Out-
side of the bustling "anchor dis-
trict," the rest of the city was
failed to develop.
Ian Beniston, deputy director
of the Youngstown Neighbor-
hood Development Corporation,
said they developed a neighbor-
hood-specific strategy and are
currently using it to implement
change on the city.
Beniston added that the
creation of the Youngstown
Neighborhood Development
Corporation increased the com-
munity's capacity for change,
and underlined his optimism for
the city's future.
The final challenge was down-
sizing. When a community's
population declines, its resourc-
es and investment also decline,
which further discourages resi-
dents to move or stay in the city.
"Services that people have
come to expect get shed and
it's taken a long time for
Youngstown to figure out a way
around that problem," Morrison
said.


SIT-IN
From Page 1A
Blake Jones and CSG repre-
sentatives, including Business
senior Michael Proppe, CSG
president, behind closed doors
late Wednesday night. At press
time it was unclear whether
any decisions or compromises
had been made between the
groups.
LSA senior Suha Najjar, a Pal-
estinian American and member
of SAFE, said CSG's postpone-
ment of voting on the resolu-
tion and limitation on students'
speech was unjustifiable.
"I think yesterday what hap-
pened on this campus should
never happen," Najjar said.
"What we're hoping is to send a
message that we're the student
body and you need to listen to
us."
"As a Palestinian, I felt it was
extremely racist," she added.
"I felt like I was not important
enough to speak."
Proppe was unavailable
for comment on the sit-in and
CSG's plan of action on the
resolution due to the meeting
between himself, Jones and the
SAFE representatives.

SAFE and its allies arrived at
the Union at 6 p.m. Wednesday
to begin preparing for the sit-in.
In an e-mail sent to supporters,
SAFE told students "Bring your
study materials, food, friends.
The CSG chambers is our
'indefinite' home now." Najjar
said she plans to stay until CSG
meets the demands.
LSA sophomore Sarah
Aaoof, who attended Tuesday's
CSG meeting, echoed Najjar
and many other attendees in
her concerns with how CSG
addressed protesters' concerns.
Aaoof said CSG has a responsi-
bility to listen to the concerns
of the student body.
"I felt that the whole issue
was misrepresented as whole,"
Aaoof said. "We deserved more
time to present the issue. I felt
like it was pushed to the side
... considering there were 300
people plus, I don't think it was
handled correctly."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald confirmed Dean of
Students Laura Blake Jones
had "been in touch with a wide
range of students" Wednesday
regarding Tuesday's CSG meet-
ing, though he couldn't give any
further details of the meetings.
Advocates both for and

against divestment spoke at
Tuesday's meeting, though
opponents of the divestment
resolution were not present at
Wednesday's sit-in.
"I want multiple and diverse
narratives to come together
in peaceful and safe spaces on
campus," LSA junior Michele
Freed, Hillel chair, said Tues-
day. "Where all voices have a
space and are respected. This
polarizing resolution is bring-
ing about just the opposite."
Najjar said she spoke with
Jones earlier in the day about
concerns that University police
would arrest students who did
not leave the Union, where the
CSG chambers are located, by 2
a.m. when the building closes.
The sit-in began just as it
was reported that San Diego
State University's and Loyola
University Chicago's student
governments passed similar
divestment resolutions this
week.
Pro-Palestinian students at
the University have petitioned
administrators to divest from
Israel for years. However, the
University's Board of Regents
has voted against divestment
several times, most recently in
2006.

Prioritizing minors' health
E-cigarette sales to minors should be banned, but not classified as tobacco
M ichigan is poised to take another step topreventunderage smoking
by extending a ban on electronic cigarettes with state Senate Bills
667and668. Under Michigan'spublichealthcode,minorsmaybuy
e-cigarettes because they don't contain tobacco. E-cigarettes are appealing
to minors due to easy accessibility and variety of flavors. The Michigan
legislature should pass this legislation to protect vulnerable minors,however
it should not take further action to classify e-cigarettes as tobacco products.

Israel, BDS and fake balance

'd like to give a round of
applause to the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee,
University of
Michigan Hillel
and all the other
organizations
that have so
masterfully
done their job of
killing any and
all real debate JAMES
about Israel. BRENNAN
From college -
campuses to
the U.S. Congress, we should all
give a big "bravo" to the Israel
lobby for its wonderful work. These
organizations have turned human
rights activists into anti-Semites,
and one-sided forums and panels
into "open and honest discussions."
Tuesday, despite a letter signedby
36 student groups and what, I would
imagine, is the biggest turnout for
a Central Student Government
meeting in years, representatives
from CSG refused to even debate
a resolution. The resolution was
simple: it asked the University
to investigate and remove its
investments in companies benefiting
from possible Israeli abuses of
Palestinians. Yes, this was part of
the wider, controversial Boycott,
Divest and Sanctions movement, but
it did not demand condemnation of
the existence of Israel or Zionism
as a whole. How good are Israel's
lobbyists and PR people? Well, even
a university's student government
- which has no apparent functions
other than philanthropy, fighting
ticket policies and doling out
money to organizations - can't
pass a simple resolution that asks
critical questions.
Much like the hit job that Hillel
students did on Students Allied
for Freedom and Equality after
the #UMMockEviction, CSG

representatives continuously
demanded a "fair debate" on the
measure, ignoring the fact that the
very action they took prevented a
debate from happening. The idea
of fairness presented by many pro-
Israel groups seems to only apply
to themselves.
Hundreds of students show up in
support of a BDS-related resolution?
"We need to have an open and fair
debate, not something so one-sided."
A person asserts that Israel
commits human rights violations?
"There have been atrocities on
both sides."
Students alienated from
returning to their homeland write
viewpoints attacking Israel's
treatment of them? "I feel attacked
for supporting Israel."
But try to get Hillel to host pro-
Palestinian
speakers who '
criticize Israel? Mili
Well, that's itant, a

policies.

countless times, and as I've written
in this very publication, I can't take
a side on this issue simply because
I don't know enough about it. I feel
that way about a lot of issues, and I'd
be willing to bet other people do, too.
One thing I cannot stand though is a
skewed, one-sided debate, especially
when one side has far more
resources and influence. CSG had an
opportunity last night to contribute
to a very meaningful, open,
campuswide dialogue on one of the
most divisive and important issues
of our generation. They skirted that
opportunity and further suppressed

debate and dissent at the University.
I don't care what side of the issue
you come down on, you should feel
shame for your representatives for
what they chose to do.
Malcolm X once said, "I'm for
truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for
justice, no matter who it is for or
against." These are principles that
most of us (at least I'd hope) try to
live our lives by. Truth over bias,
justice over politics, fairness over
unfairness. One of the easiest ways
to achieve the goals of truth, justice
and fairness is to fight for open and
free exchanges of ideas. Pushing
them aside, whether through CSG
votes, misleadingnewspaper articles
or loaded panel discussions, is a
disservice to the universal goals of
fairness and truth.

difference is of

fighting for their spot at the table,
whileyou've already takenyours and
condemned them for trying to do the
same. Stop with the fake demands
for fair treatment and honesty. Stop
with the laughable idea of sitting
down for an honest discussion with
all sides when all the action you take
is to the contrary. Instead, let your
actions speak.

The bills are on their way to the Michigan
House of Representatives after both were
adopted unanimously by the state Senate. The
FDA doesn't regulate e-cigarettes or their
advertisements and little significant testing
has been done to show the long-term effects of
e-cigarettes on human health. Furthermore,
there is also little research about the effects
of second hand vapor smoke.
E-cigarettes are much more accessible to
minors than traditional tobacco cigarettes,
but still pose health risks. Nicotine levels
in e-cigarettes are unregulated, and often
provide users with as much or more nicotine
than tobacco products. The availability of
e-cigarettes, combined with flavors such
as bubblegum, chocolate and cherry, leaves
minors susceptible to addiction, which could
lead to future tobacco use. Smoking habits
usually develop at a young age - about 90
percent of smokers began smoking as kids.
According to the American Cancer Society,
men who smoke are about 23 times more
likely to develop lung cancer.
Since e-cigarettes contain no tobacco, it
would be a difficult issue to label them as
such. Organizations such as the American
Heart Association and the American Cancer

society links them to tobacco products, in
order to maintain awareness of the possible
dangers. This would entail extensions of
bans on where they can be used. Some
individuals with health issues report that
the vapor is irritating to the nose and
throat, but until more research supports
these claims, legislation should not restrict
e-cigarette use in the same manner as
tobacco smoking.
Though e-cigarettes may pose a threat to
minors, they can be a useful tool for smokers in
the process of quitting tobacco. More research
on the subject is needed, but currently the
vapor of e-cigarettes is considered to be less
harmful than the smoke of tobacco. Using
an e-cigarette will not break the addiction to
nicotine but it can end dependence on tobacco.
E-cigarette cartridges without nicotine are
available as well - in this case, the smoker
goes through an imitation of smoking without
the nicotine, which could lead to breaking the
addiction. If the state classifies e-cigarettes
as tobacco then smokers will lose incentive
- such as smoking in public - to switch to
the less harmful product. Further research
needs to be conducted before the government
imposes arbitrary rules on e-cigarette users.

Giving back to the University

Most people on campus will tell you that
the University of Michigan is a truly great
university. But what makes it so great?
Michigan has excellent academics (and the
rankings to match), a wide range of interesting
classes, incredibly accomplished professors
and yes, some pretty great athletics as well. But
while all of these things are truly important,
I'd say they're not the most important factors
in Michigan's success. To my mind, there are
two things that make Michigan truly special:
the bold ideas that are created here at all levels
- by students and faculty - and the desire to
give back to the Michigan community.
When I was in high school, I decided to
come to Michigan for those two reasons. I was
impressed with the exciting and novel work
being done in Ann Arbor, but I was even more
impressed with the Michigan community,
workingtogether to give back to the University
that had educated and supported them. I truly
believe the largest factor for the greatness of
this University is that the community works
together to create bold ideas, which is now one
of the three pillars of the University's Victors
campaign.
Why is support of inventiveness on campus
important? In some ways, it's obvious. These
are things that change the world on a local and
global scale. When a new medicine is created,
when a new technology is introduced, you can
be certain ingenuity was the seed of develop-
ment. Important to University researchers
and scholars, original ideas allow for the real-
ization of goals, the thrill of discovery and the
abilityto help those in need. Bold ideas are the
lifeblood of the University of Michigan. This
creativity helps to maintain our reputation as
one of the world's top universities. But inge-
nuity isn't just for University professors; it's
important for University students too.
Very few students are content to let their
Michigan experience begin and end in the
classroom. In my experience, my fellow class-
mates want to get their hands dirty, working in
the lab, helping out in the world, doing things
that matter. Supporting bold ideas will allow
for students with the drive to make things

happen and get involved here on campus. The
1,200-person Hackathon in the Big House,
sponsored by MHacks, is just one example.
And while Michigan students can make
just about anything happen, there are
certain things, such as laboratory research,
that students can't do on their own. Ideas
fostered by researchers on campus provide
students with an opportunity to volunteer
in labs, work exciting projects, apply their
knowledge to real-world situations and maybe
even contribute to their community and their
world. Basically, bold ideas give students an
opportunity to give back.
I came to the University because I
wanted to be part of the incredible tradition
of excellence in research. I have had the
opportunity to work in a biomedical research
lab, translating bold scientific ideas into
reality. I have already benefited enormously
from being part of that. I want to be able to
say that I gave something back in exchange
for what I've learned..I want to be able to say
that I worked to become part of Michigan's
reputation for research excellence rather
than just benefiting from an association
with it. I want to do something of substance,
something of importance, if not necessarily
of great magnitude. I don't want to leave this
university saying, "I'll give something back
to U of M when I'm older." I want to say that
I did everything in my power to make the
University proud while I was here. There are
many ways to give back to the University. In
my mind, the most important is to give back
with bold ideas, whether by introducing your
own or by supporting the ideas of others.
I consider myself very lucky to be a student
in Ann Arbor, and not a day goes by where I'm
not grateful for being the beneficiary of the
great things the University offers its students.
I could be very successful simply taking all
that this school offers me, grabbing my diplo-
ma and moving on to a career. But if I did that,
while I would be successful, I wouldn't be sat-
isfied. There are other reasons why I'm here.

Missing from
the weekend

HEY YOU!
Do you love the weekend?
And Beyonce? And watching home improvement

You should consider joining, it seems like we
have a lot in common.

Daily Weekend Contributor
Between a cappella con-
certs, theatrical plays and
sporting events, it might seem
like the University has it all.
But for those of you dreaming
of your weekend plans in the
middle of your Friday after-
noon class, you may find a few
things lacking.
Bringing out the hipster
Fairs and festivals have
their place on campus outside
of Welcome Week and fresh-
man affairs - in fact, Ann
Arbor is filled with them dur-
ing the summers and springs,
and the University organizes
its fair share of outdoor events
during the warmer seasons.
But, free community events
don't have to end as soon as the
sub-zero temperatures set in.
While sunny, green days
are a rarity during most of the
semester, indoor spaces can
do just as well. Street vendors
such as Curry Up and Beet
Box can easily set up in indoor
spaces - if the Unions allowed
it, that is - and entrepreneurs
could showcase their prod-
ucts, probably more easily,
inside. Student organizations
can put on mini-shows, giving

their members a free opportu-
nity to show their skills, and
any student looking to escape
the books for a bit can have the
perfect place to let out some
steam without being left out in
the cold.
Where my bands at?
If I were to judge a cam-
pus by its music ... well, the
University sure wouldn't top
that list. Music is social, and it
draws communities together
toward a singular purpose -
much like sports do. We come
together as an entire college
for football and basketball
games, but checking out local
music is hardly ever the go-to
weekend activity.
Don't get me wrong, there's
always music in Ann Arbor and
if you look hard enough, it's
not impossible to find a band at
a fraternity or a student orga-
nization benefit concert. With
intimate venues like The Ark
and the Blind Pig, great bands
do pop up every now and then.
But music on campus doesn't
permeate. There isn't a way
for me to find all the places on
campus where I can survey all
the free, local and live music
options playing that night and
choose the one I go to based on
what I'm feeling.

Hit the books
As much as we can com-
plain about the lack of more
social activities on campus
during the weekend, the truth
is that for most of us, week-
ends are prime studying time.
on weekends, scavenging
for an empty table becomes
the impossible task at the
undergraduate and graduate
libraries, and stress levels run
high. There's an SLC for the
broad sciences, and a Mathlab
for pure mathematics, but
what about the outliers? For
every subject - whether it be
something as commonplace
as communications or some-
thing as niche as Asian art
- there should be a set place
that I can go to every week to
find peer or GSI tutors willing
to ease me into understanding
elaborated concepts, as well
as other students wanting to
study in cohesive, tight-knit
groups.
Think of the number
of empty lecture halls,
classrooms and spaces on
weekends - all of this is
underutilized study space on
campus. Think of how accom-
plishable academics would be
if the resources were readily
available.

Budget Snacking: Oreo chocolate popcorn

- 20 Oreo cookies (about two
rows from the package)

Directions:
- Follow the box instructions

from the mouth of Michigan soft-
ball coach Carol Hutchins, it's far
from just lip service - it's the cul-

In 2014, the Wolverines are
stacked with enough talent and

soporific coachspeak to a bonafide
blueprint for victory.
Hutchins is on the University's
pantheon of prolific coaches. She
sets the standard for how a sys-

the same mantras in every player,

Michigan has
strengths all over
the diamond
By JUSTIN MEYER
Daily Sports Writer
Awaiting the opening of Big
Ten play later this week, the
No. 6 Michigan softball team
has already learned a lot about
its roster: This team has depth
at the plate, in the field and on
the mound.
The Wolverines create runs
from a number of hitters in the
order and are comfortable play-
ing in tight games and blow-
outs. Though Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins continues to
tinker with pitching, a stable
Michigan starting lineup has
emerged in recent weeks.
The Daily breaks down the
2014 Wolverines.
Pitchers
Haylie Wagner is back.
Michigan has a deep pitch-
ing rotation with freshman
Megan Betsa and junior Sara
Driesenga, but Wagner, who
was plagued by a back injury
last season, is perfect on the
year and sporting an unthink-
able 0.93 earned run average in
the 15 appearances she's made
so far. The left-handed junior
has faced top competition and
finally looks healthy.
Driesenga and Betsa, both
right-handed, throw harder
than Wagner and have shown
some great flashes from the
mound, but continue to be
inconsistent. Driesenga, who
was expected to be the go-to
pitcher before the season, and
Betsa, have each seen 30 fewer
innings than Wagner this year
but still figure to play major
roles. Hutchins wants to be
able to use her full rotation
come NCAA tournament time
in May, so both pitchers will
see a lot of game action.
Catcher
Junior Lauren Sweet has
been solid defensively this year
and has continued to grow into
a vocal leader for the Wolver-
nes. Michigan could use a
little more offensive produc-
tion from Sweet, though, who
is batting just .224, but has hit
well in clutch situations this
season. Sweet's real value is
as a defensive rock behind the
plate, and her performance in
the first third of the season has
reinforced that notion.
First Base
First base emerged last
season as a steady point in
the Wolverines' infield when
then junior Caitlin Blanchard
stepped up to the challenge
and was named to the All Big
Ten First Team. Now a senior,
Blanchard has played an
important role in the batting

order, backing up sophomore
shortstop Sierra Romero to
make teams think twice about
walking Michigan's star at the
plate. Blanchard has exceeded
expectations, slugging .452
with 18 RBI.
Second Base
One of the Wolverines' most
important freshman contribu-
tors has been Abby Ramirez,
who has committed only one
error on the year in the field
and is batting a respectable
.324. Michigan would like to
see more clutch hitting out of
Ramirez, though, as she is bat-
ting just .125 with runners in
scoring position. If Ramirez
can continue to improve at
the plate, she will have a good
chance to be an All-Big Ten
Freshman Team selection at
the end of the season.
Short Stop
In her second season, sopho-
more Sierra Romero has dealt
with sky-high expectations
with aplomb. Romero, who was
selected to the ESPNW pre-
season All-America first team,
is slugging .791 with 31 RBI.
In addition to continuing to be
a threat in the field, Romero is
also batting .606 with runners
in scoring position, something
the Wolverines have struggled
with. Romero will continue
to wreak havoc on opposing
teams despite facing a large
number of intentional walks
already this season.
Third Base
Third base was a big ques-
tion mark for Michigan before
the season, but freshman Lind-
say Montemarano has ended
the debate. Montemarano won
the job with outstanding per-
formances in the infield all
winter, boasting a .953 fielding
percentage. The second fresh-
man in a young infield, Mon-
temarano, too, has struggled a
bit at the plate, but has started
all but three games this season.
Outfield
The big three names in the
outfield have been sophomore
Sierra Lawrence and seniors
Nicole Sappingfield and Lynd-
say Doyle. All three have start-
ed the majority of games this
year and contributed signifi-
cantly at the plate.
Lawrence, coming off an
exceptional freshman season,
has been particularly strong.
In 27 at-bats with runners in
scoring position, Lawrence
has knocked in 22 RBI, second
only to Romero. Sappingfield
and Doyle are batting .398 and
.344 respectively and provid-
ing an important dose of senior
leadership. Hutchins has
repeatedly complained that the
Wolverines have lacked leader-
ship at times this season, and
both Doyle and Sappingfield
are in perfect roles to step up as
leaders in the coming months.

HUTCHINS
From Page 6A
conversation toward "one-
pitch softball," that "champi-
ons adjust" or that "the game
doesn't know."
This year, Hutch's team has
all the pieces to execute the
phrases they echo so read-
ily. And with the bulk of the
non-conference schedule over,
Michigan has already had its
mettle tested when it comes
to sticking to the Gospel of
Hutchins.
one-pitch softball:
In the season opener against
then-No. 4 Florida, the Wolver-
ines led, 4-0, with two outs in
the seventh inning. Junior right-
hander Sara Driesenga had held
the Gators to just two hits and
appeared to be just a few pitches
from aseason-openingwin.
That was the problem.
Driesenga seemed focused on
finishing the game, not making
the best pitch for the count. Then
Florida got a hit. And another.
And another. And another. Sud-
denlyitwas a4-4gamegoinginto
extra innings, and then a 9-4 loss.
Game over. Lessonlearned.
Flash-forward to Feb. 22, with
Michigan leading No. 5 Kentucky
3-0 in the seventh inning, and

junior left-hander Haylie Wagner
having given up just two hits all
game.
Sound familiar?
This time, Wagner made her
pitches, one at a time, and the
Wildcats went down 1-2-3. It was
textbook one-pitch softball.
Champions adjust:
In an attempt to escape the
fickle Ann Arbor weather, the
Wolverines went to the Louisville
SluggerInvitational inLakewood,
Calif.the last weekofFebruary.
Surprisingly, though, four of
their five games were canceled
due to inclement weather, and
they weren't even able to be
outside long enough to run a
practice.
"You either let it defeat you,
or you defeat it," Hutchins said
then. "You have to rise above
it."
And rise above it they did.
Michigan emerged from the
storm to split a pair of games
with then-No. 4 UCLA.
. But adjustment is perpetual.
It means being quick to iden-
tify problems and starting on a
solution immediately.
With this Wolverine team,
there's enough talent that
when one position group is
down, any other group is
strong enough to buoy the team

while it recovers. In that way,
it can be hard to differentiate
between what is adjustment
and what is a good team cover-
ing up its few problems with a
surplus of star power.
The game doesn't know:
If there's one "Hutchins-
ism" sure to ring true for this
team, it's this one.
Between sophomore ESPN
Preseason All-American short-
stop Sierra Romero, freshman
right-hander Megan Betsa and
sophomore outfielder Sierra
Lawrence, Michigan is loaded
with high ceilings.
Hutchins hasn't eased them
into competition to maximize
their potential; she has thrown
them right into the fire -
because she can.
"We didn't recruit anyone
to come in and take a year off
to be a freshman," Hutchins
said. "The game doesn't know
whether you're a freshman or
a senior. The game only knows
how you play it."

With how Michigan's
younger players have per-
formed early on, it's hard to
argue otherwise.
Betsa is 6-3 with a 2.27 ERA
and a team-leading 63 strike-
outs in 49 innings pitched.
Romero leads the Wolverines
with six home runs and 31 RBI,
slugging .791. Lawrence isn't
far behind those numbers.
These are players who are
going to make or break the sea-
son for Michigan, and they're
hardly any older than the
recruits who come and watch
them play.
And that's all by design.
A Hall of Famer with 15 Big
Ten titles under her belt and a
Womens' College World Series
ring on her finger, there's no
question Hutchins knows what
she's doing in the dugout. This
year's group of players has all
the talent to backup her classic
rhetoric. As they keep deliver-
ing on it, the seemingly mun-
dane echoes will only get more
emphatic.

Illinois (14-7)
The Fighting Illini have only
played two ranked teams all sea-
son, and lost to both of theo.
Illinois was clobbered by No. 3
Tennessee 10-0, and was later
beat twice by No. 13 South Ala-
bama.
Player to watch: Freshman
right-hander pitcher Brandi
Needham
Needham has accounted for
nine of the Fighting Illini's wins
and has an ERA of 1.63. Needham
has proven to be Illinois' only
accountable pitcher so far this
season, and the other two that
have seen game action have aver-
ages of 3.04 and 4.32.
Wisconsin (12-10)
The Badgers have just three
hitters with averages over .300,
but hurting Wisconsin even more
is its lack of reliable pitchers. Hav-
ing played only two pitchers all
season, the Badgers' bullpen has

an ERA above 3.50.
Player to watch: Senior right-
handed pitcher Cassandra Dar-
rah.
Darrah was named to the All-
Big first team in 2013 after posting
an ERA of 1.82 that season. So far
in 2014, Darrah has been slightly
uncharacteristic with an average
of 2.59, but if she recovers any-
time soon, beware.
Ohio State (12-14)
The Buckeyes lack the depth in
both hitting and pitching to stay
afloat in the Big Ten. Ohio State
hasn't found a starting pitcher
yet, and it has just two hitters
batting above .300. After facing
zero ranked opponents all season,
the Buckeyes are going to have a
tough time in conference play.
Player to watch: Junior out-
fielder Caitlin Conrad
Conrad is leading the team in
hitting, but she also accounts for
five of the Buckeyes' 13 home runs.

In Michigan's two victories

the Nittany Lions fired 84.
"It starts with getting pucks

Berenson said.
In the Wolverines' 6-2 win

said. "That was a huge win for us,

The Wolverines will need
sound defense, opportunistic
forechecking and rock-solid goal-
tending to make a run at the Big
Ten Tournament title. But for
Thursday, they'll need to execute
a game plan and stay focused
against a team that has nothing
to lose.
Michigan doesn't have much
wiggle room either. Another
defeat at the hands of Penn State
could be enough to nail the door
shut on a roller coaster of a sea-
son.

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Michigan coach John Bellein wants to make sure Michigan doesn't overlook Wofford in the first round of the tournament.
Up first: Woffiord

Michigan hopes to
make another run
deep in the NCAA
Tournament
By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
The last three times the
Michigan men's basketball
team played in a tournament, it
reached the championship game
- never mind the result in those
games.
A fourth straight would be
quite an accomplishment, and
that's what the Wolverines are
setting out to do when they
begin the NCAA Tournament
on Thursday against Wofford
as the No. 2 seed in the Midwest
region.
It's the highest seed Michi-
gan has attained in the John
Beilein era, and while the
15-seed upset is certainly not
unprecedented, the Wolverines
will have more margin for error
than in opening games in prior
years.
That, however, certainly
won't be an invitation for the
team to look ahead to its Satur-
day game.
"I thought this team did a
great job of not thinking ahead
all year and taking it game by
game and preparing the best we
can for Wofford," sophomore
forward Glenn Robinson III told
reporters Wednesday.
For a team that plays its best
when it has a source of motiva-
tion - a chip on its shoulder
- the matchup against the Ter-
riers seems to fall short of pro-
viding that.
Beilein is doing what he can
to talk up Wofford and instill

a sense of urgency. The team
seemed to lack that punch in
the quarterfinal of the Big Ten
Tournament when Illinois
nearly sprung an upset with the
Wolverines looking lethargic for
stretches of play.
"It might not be a team that
jumps off the paper," said fifth-
year senior center Jordan Mor-
gan. "But somebody that you
have to respect and take very
seriously."
Added Beilein: "It probably
bothers me a little bit (that many
Michigan players hadn't heard
of Wofford) because I know how
good those teams are, and as I
watch NIT scores yesterday ... as
a guy who came from that terri-
tory, I remind them all the time
how everyone this time of the
year is really good. You got to
come ready to play."
While the impetus is there
to shrug off the Wofford
matchup, working in the Wol-
verines' favor is that they lost
their previous game, the Big
Ten Tournament Final against
Michigan State. Michigan has
been impressive over the last
few years at coming back from
losses. It hasn't lost consecutive
games this year and has won
games following a loss by an
average of 24 points.
Maybe it won't come against
Wofford, but the close games
may arrive quickly for Michigan,
though that may not be a bad
thing. The Wolverines are 9-2
in games decided by fewer than
five points. Four of those wins
have come in the last month,
and neither of the losses were in
2014.
"We've really played well in
those last few minutes to seal
those games up," said sopho-
more guard Nik Stauskas. "So
I just think those games have

done a good job of preparing
us for this tournament because
you're not going to blow teams
out and you're going to have a lot
of games where it comes down
to the last few minutes. I think
we're ready for that."
After facing the same teams
for the last 11 weeks, Michigan
can finally shed its worn-thin
Big Ten scouting reports.
"I think every university in
the country gets excited about
playing somebody else they
haven't seen twice, or three
times during the year," Beilein
said Sunday.
But where Beilein would nor-
mally have up to a week to pre-
pare for a team that he knows
well in his
own confer-
ence, the Michigan vs.

means less rest. If Michigan
makes it to Saturday, it will be

if ever, have to do.
The heightened adrenaline of
March Madness works to neu-
tralize that fatigue.
"It's a different focus now,"
Morgan said. "It's a different
level of intensity when it comes

to the game."

Cross book

By JAMIE BIRCOLL

Charles R. Cross's "Here We
Are Now: The Lasting Impact
of Kurt Cobain" comes to book-

years after
Nirvana's
debut Here We Are
album
"Bleach," Now: The
less than lasting Impact

the band's Chades R.Cross
induc- H
tion into Harper Callins
the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame and
20 years, almost to the date,
since Kurt Cobain's suicide.
It certainly seems that his
death is better remembered
than his life, and his music
will always be marked by the
circumstances of its abrupt
end. Kurt Cobain's life was a
troubled and interesting one,
but perhaps most importantly
it was an impactful life, one
that has left its mark on fash-
ion, cultural trends, substance
abuse and, obviously, music.
To think that everything about
rock and roll culture changed
with four little power chords ...
Cross, a best-selling author
who has written about other
Seattle-based rockers, includ-
ing Hendrix and the band
Heart, previously wrote a
biography of Cobain. With
"Here We Are Now," who's
title comes from lyrics of
"Smells Like Teen Spirit,"
he opts not to examine the
life of this tortured man, but
rather explore the impact of
his life and death on society.
It is not a biography, and one
would have difficulty to call
it a history; it's more a social
commentary on the origins
of some of the American cul-
tural phenomena that began
in the mid-90s. The author
makes clear in his preface

that this book is comprised
of his own thoughts and that
he draws his own conclusions
in trying to quantify Coba n's
life beyond
album sales;
he does so
with moder-
ate success.
The book
begins with
Cross's
experience
on April 8, VELASTING IMPACT
1994, the day
of Cobain's
death, or
rather the
discovery
of his body.
Having
worked as
a journalist
at Seattle-based The Rocket
magazine, one of the first
media outlets to really cover
the Grunge era of the early
'90s, Cross interacted with
Cobain on several occasions,
and his duties as a journal-
ist often conflicted with his
sentiments as a fan - no more
so than on that day in April.
Cross documents his experi-
ence in reporting the news
of the loss of a rock icon,
which ultimately culminated
in Cross's sudden appearance
on Larry King's radio show,
where he was asked, "Why
did Kurt Cobain matter?" It is
the brief anecdotes like these
that have the most to offer the
reader since they rely not on
speculation but on personal
experience and sentiments.
But the book is mostly com-
prised of conjectures and
commentary, often without
the backing of documentation
or sources. Indeed, several of
Cross's examples, such as the
rise of heroin-chic fashion in
the late '90s, seem more like
retrospective tabloid con-
tent than true observations.
Cobain's drug use is well docu-
mented, but the face of heroin
he was not, and the assigning
him to a controversial style
that is rooted in culture rather
than a single man disservices
the two and comes off as super-
fanaticism by the author.
On the whole, however, the
book is solid in its cultural

assertions, most notably in
Cobain's impact on Grunge
culture, a term he detested, and
the response to heroin abuse
treatment in
the years fol-
lowing his
death. Cross
has some
noteworthy
points to offer
the reader
as he exam-
IFKRTODB otines Cobain's
feminist and
pro-gay rights
activism and
his tearing
down of clas-
sical gen-
der roles in
rock music.
Towards the
end of the book, Cross looks at
trends in young adult suicide
rates and their small but sur-
prising decrease in the weeks,
months and years following
Cobain's death.
"Here We Are Now" serves
best the reader who has yet.to
be indoctrinated into the histo-
ry of Nirvana or Grunge music
as a whole; it is best read as
an introduction to Cobain and
his music by presenting some
of its greatest lasting legacies,
and, hopefully, will encourage
the reader to pick up a record
or download an MP3. To the
diehards, though, there is less
appeal - we know why Kurt
Cobain was important; we can
hear his influence on nearly
every song on the radio and see
his influence in countless areas
of society like the rise in thrift
store culture. The book doesn't
delve into the psyche of the
man behind the music or the
movements, which might be
more interesting to some.
But Cross's main point,
which he is careful to stress, is
that Cobain never conformed
to society's standards even as
society tried to morph those
standards around him. He was
a free spirit trapped by his own
demons, but who very much
lived by his lyrics, "come as you
are, as you were." His music
is his legacy, but his lasting
impact stems from the subtext
of his life: be yourself, live
fully, love everyone.

There was a stretch of epi-

week's episode .
differed from T Good
that stretch, l Mef
diverging CBS
slightly from
the main story
to give us
insight into
Alicia's past through a series of
fascinating flashbacks.
The focus of the episode
is Alicia's attempt to write
a speech for an American
Bar Association conference.
Through flashbacks, the writers
showed the troubles she dealt
with, including being told that
she couldn't be hired because
she was the wife of a disgraced
politician; they showed how
much more confident in her
abilities she's become over the
past five seasons.
Though the episode did

interrupt the major story arc,
it didn't completely ignore the
ongoing arc of this half-season
involving the Office of Public
Integrity investigating Peter
Florrick's voter fraud. This
week, they went after Will as
a co-conspirator in the action.
This also served as the return of
Carrie Preston ("True Blood"),
the show's best recurring guest
star, as the quirky lawyer Els-
beth Tascioni who Will enlists
to represent him. Preston per-
fectly captures the eccentrici-

ties of the character, creating
some brilliantly funny moments
in each of the episodes she's in.
This episode was no exception.
With 22 episodes to fill,
broadcast network series like
"The Good Wife" sometimes
need filler episodes in order to
not stretch their main arc too
thin. The episode's captivating
flashbacks provided some great
insights into Alicia's past, and
the return ojf Preston added
some much needed fun.

In the last year, Zedd has

producer to
a bonafide
mainstream
pop star. Best itd Y
known for Zedd
his smash Interscope
singles "Clar-
ity" and "Stay
the Night,"
the German
EDM artist churns out radio-
friendly fare at an alarming
clip. His latest track, "Find
You," is the lead single off of
the "Divergent" soundtrack,
a young-adult blockbuster
released this week. Like
Zedd's previous singles, "Find
You" is dancefloor-ready, but
its lack of originality makes
it ultimately an unmemorable
listen.
"Find You" features vocals
from two mostly anonymous
singers, Matthew Koma and
Miriam Bryant. What the

track lacks in star power, it
attempts to make up for in a
catchy hook and an elaborate
video. The music video opens
with a typical club scene, but
quickly changes direction by
including a Hitchcock-esque
bird chase and a cinemati-
cally gorgeous motorcycle
excursion. The nonsensical
plot moves to a snowy forest,
which is never described, but
a cohesive script is clearly not

the director's goal.
The video features good-
looking young people and
colorful backdrops that nicely
accompany the soaring vocals
of the chorus. "Find You" may
not have achieved the main-
stream popularity that Zedd's
previous singles have, but it
succeeds as an accessible song
that fits in on pop radio while
maintaining EDM credibility.

'How to Succeed

Student-run
theater to perform
Broadway musical
By MADDIE THOMAS
Daily TV/New Media Editor
On a cold and dreary Michigan
night, hitching a bus ride to the
very last stop on Commuter South
wouldn't seem like the best way to
lift your spirits. Hop offthebus and
you're alone in a desolate asphalt
nowhere (and only wakes from its
slumber to the caffeine injection of
a Football Saturday in September
or the sporadic basketball game). If
you're lucky, though, you'll notice
a faint glimmer peeking out of the
dark. The non-descript Student
Theatre Arts Complex (or STAC) is
a beacon in the snowy quietude of
South Campus, holding within it a
secret treasure: A buzzing ecosys-

tem of performers, designers, pro-
ducers and directors, aglow with
the palpable energy of MUSKET's
"How to Succeed in Business With-
out Really Trying."
Each semester, the University's
entirely student-run theater com-
pany, MUSKET, pulls talent from
all walks of campus to put on a
show. This weekend, the group is
tackling its second musical of the
2013-2014 season - the classic
"How to Succeed in BusinessWith-
out Really Trying." Most will rec-
ognizethe "Mad Men"-era satirical
comedy for its recent revival on
Broadway, which starred big-name
actors like Daniel Radcliffe and the
University's own Darren Criss, but
it originally rose to mainstream
popularityin 1962, when it won the
Pulitzer Prize for Drama.
The laugh-out-loud Broadway
musical is a 180-degree flip from
MUSKET's fall show, "Rent," a
contemporary rock-opera about

HIV/AIDS.

direction and acting choices con-
sciously highlight timeless themes.
"Without Really Trying"
"How to Succeed" is the story
of J. Pierrepont Finch, a window
washer who, through following
the instructions outlined in the
eponymous book, quickly rises
in the ranks of the World Wide
Wicket Company. The director of
the show, Music, Theater & Dance
junior Eleanor Todd explained,
"It's definitely a satire to the n1h'
degree about big business and the
idea of success. There is no manual
that gives you every single step to
succeeding, and that's what the
whole show is about - that fiction-
al manual and how it critiques big
business, which is still very much
VILUIAMS/Daily pertinent today."
The show's satire rests on the
shoulders of the characters, par-
ticularly J. Pierrepont Finch, who
is simultaneously a conniving
manipulator and an empathetic
protagonist. Music, Theater &
Dance senior Karl Skyler Urban,
whoplays inchin this production,
describes this dichotomy as the
most interesting part of bringing
the role to the stage.
"The show is called 'How to

"I think especially college stu-

to know, how to get to the right
meetings, and who to follow down
a hallway to get where they wanna
be," Rosenthal said.

der gap in wages and all of those
things that you see in this show
that are satirized through charac-
ters like Rosemary and the female
secretaries who literally sing a song
about how they're not toys," Todd
said.
She and LSA junior Kimberly
Hay, who portrays Rosemary, put a
lot of thought into the implications
of the character in preparation for
the show.
"This whole show is meant to
bring to light things that we sort
of take for granted like the follies
of the corporate world and gender
inequality," Hay said. "Back then it
was obviously much more blatant,
but it's still really relevant today.
The only thing Rosemary really
knows how to be ambitious for is
to find a man and not have to work
and settle down."
The show's other leadingfemale
character, Hedy LaRue, described
by Todd as "the quintessential
vamp of the show," acts as a foil to
the sweet and slightly naive Rose-
mary. Hedy is the mistress of the
company's president, J.B. Biggley,
and is often portrayed as a ditzy
dumb blonde archetype, but Todd
read her as more street smart.
"Hedy manipulates men really
brilliantly because she under-
stands as a woman that she really
only has one weapon and it's sex,"
Todd said.
In an interesting twist on the
classic show, this production of
"How to Succeed" stars a man in
the role of Hedy LaRue - a choice
that came about by chance, but
ended up having significant mean-
ing.
"We hadn't intended on using
a man at all but Ross came in and
gave this great audition, and I was
really thinking about it and I was
like, 'isn't it even more poignant if
Hedy LaRue, who is the one female
who actually has some power in
the show, is played by a man?' "
Todd said. "In casting it's impor-
tant to make sure that a big show
like this is funny, but everything
also has deeper meaning under-
neath it."
MUSKET's Business
Much like an actual busi-
ness, MUSKET runs on creativ-
ity, innovation and collaboration.
Unlike the characters in the show,
though, the team behind "How

to Succeed in Business Without
Really Trying" is putting signifi-
cant effort into the production.
Rehearsals run from 7-11 p.m.
every night of the week except for
Sundays. When they're not in the
scene that's being rehearsed, cast
members hustle through the halls
of the STAC, mumbling lines and
doing vocal warm-ups or coin-
pleting homework for the follow-
ing day.
Because it's a student-run
group with open auditions,
MUSKET attracts students from
across the University, and that's
what makes it a fun organization
to be involved with.
"It's the best way to participate
in musical theater on campus
while still studying, like, engi-
neering, and meet people from
all other majors who are doing
the same thing as you are. You
get to meet new people and dif-
ferent people while stillbeingable
to maintain a different study," said
Engineering sophomore Addison
Thalhamer.
Music, Theater & Dance junior
Elias Wygodney likens the experi-
ence of working with MUSKET to
the themes of the show, which he
reads in a more positive light.
"The story itself shows that
if you have a passion for some-
thing, you should trust in your-
self and believe that you yourself
can take you there," Wygodney
said. "Finch doesn't really depend
on others to take himself where
he wants to go and neither does
Biggley. That's what made them so
successful. It should give students
the confidence to take themselves
wherever they need to go."
"We all work together through-
out the process to make sure that
what's happening in the rehears-
al room is working toward our
vision," Rosenthal said. "We
make sure it gets executed from
the very first rehearsal to the last
promotional poster that is hung
on campus for the show."
The ebullient cast of "How to
Succeed" achieves their version
of success by working long hours
and late nights, honing their
material and their skills right up
until opening night. The mem-
bers of MUSKET are dedicated
to their business of putting on
a show, and they don't need an
instruction manual to tell them
how to do it.

SINGLE REVIEW

The last time the Wu-Tang
Clan released a studio album?
2007. So thisweek, they sur-
prised fans
by drop-
ping"Keep
Watch," Keep WAch
a song WM-Tang Clan
from their f .h
upo-feat. Nathaniel
upcom-
ing album Soul Temple
A Better
Tomorrow. The track looks back
to hip-hop'sgolden age as much
as it looks forward to the future
of rap.
"Keep Watch" features a
retro, soulful vocal background
backing a smooth hook per-
formedby singer Nathaniel. As
much as it synthesizes both the
present trends and the vintage
old school sounds, "Keep Watch"
celebrates the group's chem-
istry - seemingly, rap groups
are a thing of the past, but Wu-
TangClanhasmanaged tokeep

the concept relatively fresh by
showcasingtheir individual and
undeniable rap talent (can any-
one start a verse as smoothly as
Method Man?).
Lyrically, the song is a throw-
back, alludingto early hip-hop
culture ("b-boys" references
to Trouble T. Roy and Heavy
D, etc.). But isn't there some
rule about past trends always
cycling back? If so, the Wu-
Tang Clan has hit the nail on
the head: Old School feels so
foreign, exotic and, as a result,
cool. Aside for a few standout
rap groups like Odd Future
and G.O.O.D Music, theindi-

vidual rapper has generally
become the fan favorite of the
two. And while Wu-Tang Clan
may not be looking to make
waves with "Keep Watch,"
they're proving that hip-hop
groups can still be done suc-
cessfully.
Their upcoming album is
expected to be released in the
coming months, commemorat-
ing the Wu-Tang Clan's 20th
anniversary. If "Keep Watch" is
any indication of how the album,
ABetter Tomorrow, will turn
out, then fans should expect an
exciting release.

Gender Roles in the Workforce
As Finch rises in at the World
Wide Wicket Company, he attracts
the attention of Rosemary, a sec-
retary who dreams of marrying a
successful businessman and living
in a house in the suburbs. Her big
solo, "Happy to Keep His Dinner
Warm," features lyrics like "Oh, to
be loved by a manI respect; to bask
in the glow of his perfectly under-
standable neglect," offering a bla-
tant and scathing satiricalcriticism
of gender roles in the workforce -
an issue that has improved since
the era of the musical's composi-
tion, but still persists to this day.
"There's still sexism in the
workforce, there's still a huge gen-

THE VAG
From Page 1B
When TeRaye Walker told
members of her church that she
was acting in "The Vagina Mono-
logues," someone joked "Your
vagina can talk?" The recent
School of Social Work graduate
laughed it off, but doesn't deny
the sense off fear, and shame, that
surrounds the scary V-word. LSA
sophomore Irene Suh - who is a
member of Students for Choice
sod proodlh wears a T-shirt
emblazoned with the reproductive
rights slogan "My kitty, my choice"
. has yet to tell her parents about
her role in the show because she
worries about their reaction.
"Until I got to college, I was
broughtup in the household where
it was not OK to talk about sex, or
vaginas or reproductive health,
so being able to talk about this is
really liberating for me," Suh said.
Fear, shame, ignorance: symp-
coms of a culture focused on sex
rather than sexuality, objectifica-
tion rather than understanding.
"The Vagina Monologues" is an
effort to recreate what we think
about the female reproductive
organ -- and about women them-
selves.
"This is kind of stuff that's still
so taboo to talk about," said LSA
senior Suzanne Maclaren, cast
member, "Sex in general is kind
of taboo to talk about, but sex
in women and the 'power of the
vagina' - it's still something that
people are afraid to talk about."
Performance with a purpose
"The Vagina Monologues" was
first written in 1996 by Eve Ensler,
who conducted over 200 inter-
views with women of all ages and
backgrounds to write a series of
monolgues ostensibly about one
hing: the vagina. Now the show
is performed by groups around
the country, with the proceeds
going to support a non-profit of
their choice along with V-Day, the
organization started by Ensler
that strives to end violence against
women. The show was brought
back to the University last year by
Students for Choice, an organiza-
tion that promotes reproductive
rightsonscampus
"'(Students for Choice) brought
'Vagina Monologues' because we
are a feminist organization and
women's empowerment is very
closely tied with reproductive
rights," said LSA junior Sophia
Kotov, co-president of the orga-
nization. "When female bodies
are mentioned in the media, this
is alomost always deeply problem-
atic, offensive and oppressive. 'The
Va'ina Monologues,' on the other
hand, provides an experience for
people of all genders to hear frank
talk and trrue stories about women
and women's bodies coming from
these same people."
This year the show is going to
be performed in the Rackham
Auditorium on T'hursday, March

it gets people more comfortable
talking about their vagina, talking
about their stories."
Vulnerability and
Empowerment
Think about the last television
commercials you watched. How
many included women? Probably
most. How many featured "sexy"
women - those dressed scantily,
those wearing excessive makeup,
those in unnatural and hyper-sex-
ualized poses? Now, how many of
these women had names? How
many had stories? How many
spoke?
Women often have two options:
to be silent and overlooked, or
to speak and be labeled "radi-
cal." "The Vagina Monologues"
attempts to give women a voice
while still valuing every woman's
spectrum of sexuality; it focuses
on collective representation over
blind definition. Many cast mem-
bers repeatedly brought up the
show's emphasis onvulnerability.
"It's realizingthat sexuality and
expressions ofsexualitydon'thave
to be a source of anxiety," Maclar-
en said. "You can find comfort
whether through other people or
by yourself. To trust yourself isn't
a foolish thingto do."
This vein of empowerment
is central to the program, for
both cast members and audi-
ences. However, unlike many
representations of the word, this
empowerment comes from self-
awareness and acceptance, rather
than an outside force. "The Vagi-
na Monologues" onlyhopes to be a
catalyst in helpingpeople discover
themselves.
"It's women empowering
women and supporting each
other. Even for me it seems like it's
duplicitous," said Sam Wellman,
a recent graduate of the School of
Social Work. "Like how can you be
both angry and vulnerable? How
can you be both sexual and inno-
cent? But you can be and nobody
can take that from you, and that's
not youbeing complicated or crazy,
that's youbeinga humanbeing."
Though each part has been rei-
magined and individualized as the
actresses shape their characters,
it's valuable to recall that these
monologues are based on inter-
viewswithrealwomen - these are
not scenes in a fictional play, but
representations of real people's
deepest pains and struggles. The
hundreds of women interviewed
had to bare much of who they
were to contribute to the mono-
logues, revealing their many
human strengths and human
weaknesses.
"My biggest concern, worry,
struggle is making sure that I am
doing justice to this story," Well-
man said. "Knowing that this not
only was from an interview with
a real woman with this actual
experience, but knowing that
it struck a chord with me so it's
going to strike a chord with other
people ... I want to present it in a
way that honors that."

I let my inner self explore
the corners of my memory
as we navigate back to this
Cuban burger promised land.
There was the first time I'd
tried Frita Batidos: A very
confused freshman, I was
entirely distracted by the
nets full of limes hanging
next to the condiments at
each table. Were they decor,
air fresheners or just waiting
to be juiced by citrus-seeking
customers? I remember the
time that my fellow RAs
and I crammed around the
picnic tables outside to
celebrate/commemorate the
closing of South Quad. Only
when Mother Nature began
pouring down rain were we
forced to leave. And finally, I
remember the Fritas lunch a
close friend and I shared on
her last day in Ann Arbor. A
casualty to graduate school,
she was moving out-of-state
and on to bigger and better
things. The easiest way for us
to say "see you later" was over
a burger and milkshake.
And as much as it didn't feel
like it at the time, it really was
only a "see you later." Flash-
forward seven months, and
here we are again - the same
group of friends walking
the same blocks in search of
the same sandwich. What
better way to end the perfect
reunion weekend than at our
standby rendezvous?
With bright red noses,
cheeks and ears, we arrive
happy to finally be back in
the warmth. Drinks are first,
with everyone ordering the
usual. The health nut, Sean,
asks for "the lighter batido,"
which is made with mango
and pineapple juice. Neha
sips on a mango soda, which
she calls "the nectar of the
gods," and Emily and I enjoy
our rum-spiked coconut
cream batidos (it's never too
cold for a tropical milkshake,
ironically). The fritas -
essentially Cuban burgers
with fries stacked between
the buns - are next. Again,
no surprises here: chicken for
Sean and Neha, black bean for
Emily and chorizo for me.
I've elected to add avocado
spread, Muenster cheese
and an over-easy egg to my
frita, which always sounds
better in theory than it ends

up being in reality. Ketchup
and avocado force themselves
out from between the two
halves of the brioche bun as
my incisors tear through each
layer. Runny egg yolk drips
down the back of my hand, and
chunks of chorizo drop to the
bottom of the basket in which
the mess of the meal is served.
"Oh, that's what this fork is
for," I think.
The food here is always
impeccable, and the company
is even better. My friends and
I nosh and chat for the next
30, 60, 90 minutes, feeling
"just like the old times" as
we reminisce about the year
before: how annoyingly
unavailable Neha had been
during internship recruiting
season, how Sean had
somehow convinced himself
to become a vegetarian,
how we had to stage a "How
I Met Your Mother"-style
intervention for Emily - who
slept on her couch for weeks
to avoid putting fitted sheets
on her bunk bed - and how
I became embarrassingly
depressed one night by
watching "Hoarding: Buried
Alive." It felt so casually
normal, as if only a matter of
days had passed since our last
Fritas visit.
Take advantage
of your time
in A2.
I tried to harness this
feeling as I worked to console
myself of the fact that it would
likely be another seven months
before this would happen
again ... if we were lucky. The
plane back to reality was on
its way to transport Emily -
in the same way that it had
Chris and Rebecca the day
prior (who sadly missed out
on our Fritas excursion) - to
what seemed like thousands
of miles away. Of course, they
would actually be many hours
closer than that, but still far
enough away that trips to
Frita Batidos were relegated
to being an occasional treat.
The real world sucks.
But we make due. Texting
groups, Google hangouts
and social media keep us
all connected. Life updates
don't go unshared, and futons
and foldout beds don't go
unused. And every once and
awhile, when the stars align,
a weekend of fraternizing and
Frita Batidos in Ann Arbor
recharges our spirits and
reminds us of the enduring
power of true friendship.
To all the bright-eyed
freshmen reading this, enjoy
this rare time in your life
when you live within walking
distance of all of your
friends. To the alumni and
staff, consider reaching out
to that college friend you've
not contacted nearly recently
enough. And to Sean, Neha,
Rebecca, Chris and Emily, I'll
see you at Fritas.

You can contact Wood at
Fritas on a nightly basis or
at nisaacw@umich.edu.
