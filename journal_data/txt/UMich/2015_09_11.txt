In first all-

chapter gathering, 
administrators call 
for turning point

By EMMA KINERY 

and LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporters

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel discussed alcohol abuse 
and sexual assault — problems 
he said are rampant among the 
Greek community — during a 

gathering of students from every 
chapter of University Greek life 
Thursday.

The meeting marked the first 

of its kind where all members of 
every University Greek life chap-
ter gathered during their 170-year 
history on campus.

Schlissel’s argument centered 

on the ways in which an unfet-
tered party culture stains the 
University’s reputation — not only 
for current students, but for the 
500,000 people who graduated 
before them.

“The value of their degrees are 

gonna go down because the repu-

tation of the University of Michi-
gan won’t be the excitement in the 
Big House or our teams doing well 
under our fantastic new coach,” 
Schlissel said. “It’s not gonna be 
the kids who receive the Rhodes 
Scholarships and the Fulbright 
Scholarships, and the famous 
professors who do the work that 
you’re going to get reflected on 
for, or the National Medal for the 
Arts that our faculty won this 
past week. It’s going to be the 
‘Shmacked’ videos. So it’s really 
up to you what the value of your 
education is going to be, what the 
reputation of this institution’s 

going to be.”

The talk was met with mixed 

reactions, with some students 
coughing loudly when Schlissel, 
along with other administrators, 
mentioned problems such as low 
Greek participation in the Uni-
versity’s sexual assault survey, 
among other issues.

Each fraternity and soror-

ity was required to have at least 
70 percent of its chapter attend 
the meeting. Those who failed 
to comply will face a semester 
of social probation, a letter to 
their national organization and a 
$1,000 fine.

The meeting comes after a year 

of magnified tumult in the Greek 
community, marked by national 
press coverage of numerous fra-
ternity “ski trips” gone wrong last 
winter, in addition to increased 
scrutiny of the role of Greek life 
in excessive party culture in uni-
versity settings throughout the 
country.

Dean of Students Laura Blake 

Jones told members of Greek life 
that the issues facing their com-
munity are grave.

“I fear some of you have 

embraced a work hard, play hard 
mentality and that you may have 

taken to the extreme what has 
us on this downward spiral, and 
we know we have to turn this 
around,” she said. “It’s clear to 
me that if we can’t begin to make 
meaningful, student-led progress 
and change immediately on our 
campus, the future of sorority and 
fraternity life as we know it is in 
peril.”

Issues on campus

Though Greek life represents 

only 22 percent of students on 
campus, administrators empha-
sized the influence members 
wield on campus culture.

Researchers use 
DNA to improve 
disease diagnoses

By NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

Researchers at the Uni-

versity’s 
Michigan 
Center 

for Translational Pathology 
announced this month a new 
breakthrough 
in 
pediatric 

cancer treatment — the use of 
genetic sequencing.

Using 
a 
practice 
called 

precision oncology, a team 
of 
University 
researchers 

conducted a study that used 
genetic sequencing to tai-
lor diagnoses and develop 
new drug treatment for can-
cer patients for whom stan-
dard 
treatments 
were 
no 

longer 
effective. 
In 
some 

cases, researchers were able 
to recommend early counsel-
ing for family members based 
on the results. 

Genetic sequencing is the 

practice of determing the 

unique composition of an indi-
vidual DNA strand — a process 
that can provide researchers 
and doctors with important 
information about a patient, 
the disease they have and the 
best approach to treating it. 

The study’s lead author, 

Rajen Mody, a pediatric oncol-
ogist at C.S. Mott Children’s 
Hospital and clinical director 
of pediatric hematology and 
oncology, said the study was 
the first of its kind in the field 
of pediatric oncology.

The ongoing study, which 

began in 2012, is focused on 
142 children and young adults 
who have a cancer diagnosis. 
Eighty percent of patients in 
the group had exhausted the 
standard treatment options 
available. For each patient, the 
sequencing 
produced 
more 

than two terabytes of data — a 
significant amount of infor-
mation. The tests currently 
take more than six weeks to 
complete, significantly faster 
than previous gene sequenc-
ing mechanisms which often 

Activists hope 
to influence 

legislators before 
congressional vote 

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Ann Arbor residents held a 

vigil Thursday night to promote 

diplomacy with Iran and rally 
support for the Obama admin-
istration’s proposed deal with 
that country.

Chuck Warpehoski, direc-

tor of the Interfaith Council 
of Peace and Justice and the 
event’s organizer, said the vigil 
was intended to showcase how 
Ann Arbor residents feel about 
the deal.

“Our goal is to let members 

of Congress know their constit-

uents support this reasonable 
deal that will help make the 
world safer for nuclear weap-
ons,” said Warpehoski, who is 
a Democratic Ann Arbor City 
Council member from the city’s 
fifth ward.

About 35 people — mostly 

Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti resi-
dents — attended the event 
outside the Federal Building on 
Liberty Street.

Doctors say more 
research is needed 
despite artificial 

heart success

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

In January, 24 year-old Stan 

Larkin left the University of 
Michigan Health System with 
a SynCardia temporary Total 
Artificial 
Heart. 
He’s 
now 

waiting for a heart transplant.

Many 
patients 
aren’t 
so 

lucky. According to UMHS 
doctors, there is much more 
research to be done before this 
technology is accessible to all 
patients— 
particularly 
chil-

dren.

John Charpie, professor of 

pediatrics and director of pedi-
atric cardiology at C.S. Mott 
Children’s Hospital, said there 
are three categories of devices 
doctors can choose from when 
treating a patient with a failing 
heart. The first device, extra-

Ann Arbor residents hold 
vigil in support of Iran Deal

After historic 
procedure, ‘U’ 
heart studies 
move ahead


The vigil, co-hosted by ICPJ 

and the Ann Arbor chapter of 
Veterans for Peace, was part 
of a national movement to pro-
mote diplomacy through sup-
porting the president’s nuclear 
deal with Iran, called “60 Days 
to Stop a War.”

Officially titled the Joint 

Comprehensive Plan of Action, 
the deal would reduce sanc-
tions on Iran in return for 
restricting their ability to build 
a nuclear program.

While Obama could start 

enacting many of the accord’s 
provisions, sanctions enacted by 
the legislature would require a 
green light from Congress. The 
Senate is currently considering 
a resolution to disapprove the 
deal, which had the potential 
to derail it. However, 42 Sen-
ate Democrats have announced 
support of the deal, making the 
passage of the disapproval reso-
lution unlikely.

All of the Democratic rep-

resentatives from Michigan, 

including Sens. Gary Peters (D–
Mich.) and Debbie Stabenow 
(D–Mich.), have voiced support 
for the deal.

Most of Michigan’s Repub-

lican congressional delegation 
has announced their opposition 
to the deal. Michigan Attorney 
General Bill Schuette penned an 
open letter this month urging 
states to continue sanctions on 
the country if the deal passes.

Warpehoski said he was sur-

prised events like Thursday’s 
were necessary.

“It is mind boggling to me 

that it is controversial, and we 
need to be organizing vigils and 
protests to get the number of 
votes to make sure a presiden-
tial veto can hold up,” he said.

Bob Krzewinski, leader of 

Ann Arbor’s chapter of Vet-
erans for Peace and a speaker 
at the event, said diplomacy is 
important if the country hopes 
to prevent the mistake of hasty 
military intervention, as he 
said was made during the Iraq 
War.

“As a veteran, you see too 

much war going on,” Krzewin-
ski said. “It is all people in the 
military ask — before you go 

to war, exhaust all diplomatic 
opportunities.”

Krzewinski served during 

the Vietnam War and said he 
saw the mental and physical 
anguish of fellow soldiers and 
would “not wish that on any-
one.”

“I’m a veteran, and I’m just 

trying to use being a veteran for 
peace,” he said.

Ann Arbor resident Alan 

Haber, a member of ICPJ, said 
he wanted to promote negotia-
tion rather than war.

“It is useful to give people 

an impression that it is okay to 
stand on the street and express 
your political view, even a 
controversial political view,” 
Haber said.

Attendees also included 

four noticeably anti-Israel 
activists, holding signs that 
read “boycott Israel” and 
“defeat Israel.”

According to Warpehoski, 

these activists were not among 
those who helped host the 
event, and they attempted to 
interrupt Warpehoski during 
an address to other attendees.

Joanne Leonard, an Ann 

Arbor resident who attended 

the vigil, said she sup-
ports Israel, but also sees 
negotiation as a key factor 
in preventing war.

Several 
pro-Israel 

groups have expressed 
opposition to the deal, 
arguing it would unfreeze 
millions in Iranian assets 
while failing to prevent 
the country from obtain-
ing a nuclear weapon.

 “I think it is always a 

good idea to sit down and 
talk,” Leonard said. “I 
think they have a lot of 
safeguards built in (to the 
deal), and this is probably 
the best way rather than 
just wait for everything 
to fall out.”

corporeal membrane oxygen-
ation, or ECMO, was pioneered 
at the University. ECMO is used 
to help a patient recover after an 
operation by distributing oxy-
gen throughout the body until 
the heart can do so on its own. 

“ECMO is a form of artifi-

cial heart, and it is a technol-
ogy that was invented here 
at Michigan by a gentleman 
named Bob Bartlett,” Charpie 
said. “We probably use it two 
or three times a month for chil-
dren whose hearts do not start 
up after their operations.”

The second technology is 

the 
Total 
Artificial 
Heart, 

which Larkin received. Gabe 
Owens, assistant professor of 
pediatrics, said the mecha-
nism replaces our body’s natu-
ral pumping system until the 
patient can either receive a 
transplant or decides on “desti-
nation therapy” — meaning the 
patient keeps the mechanism 
indefinitely — if they are not a 
transplant candidate.

The 
machine 
has 
tubing 

outside the body and pumps 
blood to organs that need it. 
This method is unique in that 
the patient’s biological heart 
is completely removed, Owens 
said.

The third category, Charpie 

said, is mechanical support 
devices. ECMO can fall under 
this category. These devices 
still leave the patient’s organic 
heart inside the body, but insert 
an additional device to help the 

heart do its job.

Owens emphasized the need 

for more research, especially 
for pediatric patients.

“In 
the 
pediatric 
world, 

there’s a lot of research going 
on to make these assist devices 
or Total Artificial Hearts ame-
nable for people who are small-
er,” Owens said. “The Pediatric 
Cardiac transplant waitlist has 
one of the highest mortality 
rates of any other solid organ 
because the babies are small, 
they are young kids. They don’t 
have as much time to wait.”

Owens also noted the need 

for research on revitalizing 
sub-par organs such as kidneys, 
so they can be used for trans-
plants. This would alleviate 
some of the stress that comes 
from limited availability of 
organs from human donors for 
transplant. 

Charpie said due to lack 

of experience with artificial 
heart technology in pediatric 
patients, research needs to be 
done in many areas, including 
how to choose what anticoagu-
lants, or blood thinners, to use 
for smaller patients. He cited a 
patient of his named Caden who 
passed away due to a stroke 
caused by blood complications.

“Being so early on in this 

experience, we as cardiologists 
and cardiac surgeons didn’t 
exactly know what the optimal 
anticoagulation regimens were 
for kids on the artificial heart,” 
he said. “All we have is experi-
ence in adults.”

Owens 
expressed 
similar 

concerns and said there is tech-
nology available to assist failing 

hearts, but that it often can-
not be applied to his pediatric 
patients.

Even so, Charpie said there 

is hope. He and his colleagues 
are working on growing beating 
heart tissue from human and 
animal cells so that eventually 
patients can have their tissue 
used to build their own replace-
ment heart. Through this alter-
native process, the patient’s 
body is unlikely to reject the 
new heart.

“We’re not on the edge of 

creating a heart that beats in 
a dish yet,” Charpie said. “But 
we are in growing parts of the 
heart and getting those to a 
point where they may be able to 
transplant them back to an ani-
mal model.”

In the past, the National 

Institute of Health has funded 
this research at the University. 
Now, according to Charpie, 
these grants are harder to 
receive. 
Charpie 
and 
other 

interested University doctors 
must look to foundations and 
philanthropy for most of their 
monetary support.

Owens said there is also 

progress in miniaturizing heart 
technology to cater to pediat-
ric patients and hopes the NIH 
would fund this research.

“There 
have 
been 
great 

resources 
and 
opportunities 

through the National Institute 
of Health to fund both indus-
try and academic centers to 
advance mechanical devices for 
the support of children,” Owens 
said. “I think that’s where the 
future needs to go.”

President, Dr. Jill 

Biden highlight 
familiar message 
during Mich. visit

BY SAMANTHA WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

WARREN, Mich. — As the 2016 

presidential race picks up and 
President Barack Obama enters 
his final 16 months in office, the 
Obama administration kicked off 
a nationwide tour Wednesday 
focusing on a familiar message — 
the importance of bolstering the 
nation’s middle class.

The president and Dr. Jill Biden, 

a professor at Northern Virgin-
ia Community College and the 
wife of Vice President Joe Biden, 
addressed a crowd of several hun-
dred people at Macomb Commu-
nity College. During the event, 
Obama rolled out a $175 million 
apprenticeship 
grant 
program 

through the U.S. Department of 
Labor and rallied support for a 
proposal he announced in January 
to provide a guaranteed two free 
years of community college.

Obama announced this plan 

in his State of the Union address 
with the goal of offering respon-
sible students the opportunity to 
attend two years of community 
college for free. He emphasized 
the need for every student to have 
a chance to succeed, arguing that 
the benefits of a community col-
lege degree and job skills training 
include the chance to live a more 
prosperous life.

In Macomb, Biden said giv-

ing every American the highest 
quality education possible is the 
best way to ensure people from 
all backgrounds have a chance to 
succeed.

“Our administration believes 

you should have the education and 
skills you need to succeed with-
out being saddled with decades of 
debt,” she said. “Because it’s too 
hard to get ahead when you start 
off from so far behind.”

This is the third time Obama 

has visited Warren. He cam-
paigned there in 2008, and the 
city hosted his first visit to Michi-
gan as president in 2009. It was in 
Macomb that the president first 
discussed his commitment to 
encouraging Americans to attend 

community college and investing 
in community college programs 
that serve local needs.

The 
president 
has 
visited 

Michigan 17 times since he took 
office and has continually used 
the state as a platform to discuss 
the middle class.

In 2012, he spoke at the Uni-

versity to address the rising cost 
of higher education, adding that 
receiving an education is too 
valuable to carry such a restric-
tive cost.

The president visited the Uni-

versity again in 2014 to advocate 
for raising the federal minimum 
wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour. 
He argued that workers who hold 
steady jobs should not be stuck in 
poverty because they receive low 
wages.

In his speech at Macomb, 

Obama said after World War II, 
the United States was the best-
educated nation in the world, 
contributing to the rise of a great 
American middle class.

“In places like Macomb Coun-

ty, you could feel secure knowing 
that if you worked hard, you’d 
get a chance to find a good job, 
buy a home, raise a family, send 

your kids to college,” he said. “We 
didn’t promise everybody that 
they would get rich, but we prom-
ised that everybody who worked 
hard would have a chance to get 
there, and have the dignity of a 
decent-paying job with decent-
paying benefits. That’s what it 
meant to be middle class.”

In 
more 
recent 
decades, 

Obama said, the economy has 
changed, and attempts to better 
it — including tax cuts for the 
upper class — created hardships 
for the middle class.

“We together have spent the 

last seven years (since the 2008 
recession) fighting back, getting 
focused on middle class econom-
ics once again,” he said.

This effort, he said, includes 

job creation, the provision of 
health insurance for all Ameri-
cans and a commitment to revive 
the U.S. auto industry.

“We placed our bets on Ameri-

can businesses and American 
workers, and that bet is paying 
off,” he said. “Michigan is coming 
back.”

The president cautioned that 

making comeback is not enough: 
For the sake of future genera-

tions, he said, the country has to 
do better for its citizens — not 
just restore a previous standard 
of living. He argued that wealth 
inequality remains a challenge, 
adding that jobs still do not pay 
enough and wages are still flat.

“A big part of making sure 

today’s economy works better 
for ordinary folks goes back to 
the issue of education,” he said. 
“Every 
American 
willing 
to 

work hard should have a shot at 
higher education because as the 
economy globally becomes more 
competitive, everybody’s got to 
upgrade their skills a little bit.”

According to Obama, a post-

secondary education of some kind 
will be a requirement for two out 
of every three jobs by 2020. Spe-
cialized skills, he argued, will 
be necessities in the search for a 
good job.

“Having a credential above 

and beyond your high school 
diploma, that’s the surest ticket 
to the middle class,” he said. 
“And in global competition for 
jobs and industries, having the 
best educated workforce in the 
world is the surest way for Amer-
ica to stay on top.”

T

his isn’t a column talking 
about how to solve gun vio-
lence.

Nobody 
else 

seems 
to 
care 

about 
talking 

about fixing gun 
violence, so nei-
ther 
will 
this 

column. 
Elected 

senators 
and 

presidential can-
didates 
didn’t 

have 
much 
to 

say about it after 
Charleston. 
The 

media even tired of covering gun 
control after a vote for slightly 
more stringent gun control meth-
ods failed in April 2013. And as 
support for any sort of gun-control 
measures similarly mirrors media 
coverage trends, it has been noth-
ing but inaction on any front to 
help curb a problem that’s uniquely 
American in scale.

This isn’t a column talking about 

the at least 885 mass shootings, inci-
dents in which four or more people 
were shot, that have occurred since 
Sandy Hook in December 2012. 
Sometime in between writing, edit-
ing and publishing this column, that 
number will grow, as will the num-
ber of days that the government sits 
idle as if everything is fine. Far too 
often, a lead story on the news is 
how someone else was shot, includ-
ing recently in Virginia where the 
shooting was on the news itself.

This isn’t a column about the vic-

tims of such violence, because the 
victims do not have a voice.

Untold thousands pass away too 

soon, and thousands more will fol-
low them each year with no attempt 
to change policy that could poten-
tially save even a fraction of gun 
violence victims. Even the living 
victims have their voice shut out. 
Even after former Congresswomen 

Gabrielle Giffords survived a mass 
shooting at a congressional event 
and campaigned for better gun 
policies in our nation, she could not 
overcome the roadblocks. When she 
has to urge voters to vote out the 
current leadership in office because 
that’s the only way to possibly make 
a change, the culture is broken.

This isn’t a column about the 

shooters, their motives or their per-
sonalities.

Perhaps they do it for the fame, 

fame they should never be given. 
Undoubtedly mental health treat-
ment is a huge issue in this coun-
try, another problem which needs 
solutions, especially when a large 
percentage of deaths from firearms 
are suicides. But placing too much 
blame on these problems continu-
ally sidesteps the issue that we keep 
witnessing shootings over and over, 
and shifts blame to the individual 
instead of recognizing that we have 
a serious problem with firearms 
that can’t be avoided.

This isn’t a column about num-

bers and data, which are perhaps the 
most sensible way of devising solu-
tions to issues, because numbers and 
data don’t exist by accident. 

Legislation prevented the Cen-

ters for Disease Control from con-
ducting research on gun violence 
and gun control policy, leaving last-
ing effects that have crippled any 
effort to make data-driven deci-
sions. There are plenty of statistics 
that agree that Americans own a lot 
of guns and shoot a lot of people, a 
lot more than any of our interna-
tional peers. But when it comes to 
statistics on the impact of policy 
and procedures working towards 
curbing the astronomical numbers 
of incidents, there aren’t any.

This isn’t a column about poli-

tics, because this issue is already so 
political.

The National Rifle Association 

is infamous for its involvement — 
about $25 million of it in one elec-
tion cycle — in the cutting of gun 
violence research funding from the 
CDC and its adages of “guns don’t 
kill people, people kill people.” 
Despite overwhelming support for 
background checks for those pur-
chasing weapons, legislation for 
them has been unable to pass, and 
it’s no doubt that fear of retribu-
tion from candidates that receive 
donations from the NRA has some 
effect. Perhaps that money could 
go to places other than political 
campaigns, and go toward funding 
actual solutions like better mental 
health or gun safety clinics.

And no, this column isn’t about 

taking away guns, gun control, gun 
registration or anything of the sort. 
Ownership of guns is, and always 
will be, protected by the Constitu-
tion. But our country wasn’t found-
ed on just the Bill of Rights and the 
rights to liberty and the pursuit 
of happiness. It was also founded 
on the inherent and inalienable 
right that is the preservation of 
life. There has to be a better way to 
uphold all of these.

This column is about noth-

ing, because nothing accurately 
describes what we have done in 
response to the lives claimed by 
gun violence every day.

It doesn’t take a senile Shake-

spearean king to tell us nothing 
will come of nothing, but instead 
of doing something — anything — 
we continue to move nowhere in 
solving the issue. Doing nothing 
will not stop the mass shooting 
that might occur tomorrow or the 
next day somewhere in the United 
States, but something, anything, 
might save a life. And a life is cer-
tainly about more than nothing.

T

he shooting of Michael Brown on 
August 9, 2014, by Darren Wilson, 
then a police officer in Ferguson, 

Mo., was a stark wake-up 
call to the nation. Though 
police violence and brutal-
ity has caused controversy 
since the establishment of 
law enforcement, Michael 
Brown’s killing, along with several others, 
brought public safety and the means by which 
law enforcement protects the welfare of the 
general public under scrutiny. A sequence of 
racially charged police misconduct incidents 
has sparked a demand for police interactions 
with citizens to be public information. The 
urgency to reform community policing is 
prominent nationwide. The lack of transpar-
ency within police departments intensifies 
the strained relationship between police offi-
cers and the community members they serve.

In an effort to combat crime and improve 

police-community 
relations, 
publishing 

police data can arm citizens and the police 
with the information necessary to reduce 
community violence. The federal government 
has taken an affirmative stance on increasing 
open data practices as a means of combat-
ing police misconduct. On May 18, 2015, the 
White House launched the Police Data Initia-
tive, which encourages open data practices 
to increase transparency and accountability 
in order to improve community policing. The 
goal is for police departments to use data and 
technology to build community trust and 
inform police departments of gaps in inter-
nal policies. One component of this initiative 
encourages police departments to release 
at least three data sets previously inacces-
sible to the public. Such data sets can include 
uses of force, police pedestrian and vehicle 
stops and officer-involved shootings. These 
data sets will help communities access key 
information on police-citizen encounters. 
A commitment to cataloging such data will 
also enhance internal data measures, such 
as early-warning systems, which can assist 
police leadership in detecting officers in need 
of oversight and additional training.

Increasingly, police departments across 

the country are meeting the public’s demands 
for more information, and using innova-
tive techniques to increase transparency in 
their policing tactics. Cincinnati has a com-
plaint data set that displays a description of 
the offense, where it occurred, the officer’s 

sex and race, the complainant’s sex and race 
and the results of the case. Dallas publishes 
officer-involved shootings, disclosing infor-
mation about the officer’s name, the victim’s 
name and the jury’s disposition. Louisville, 
Ky., lists assaults on officers. Los Angeles 
County presents a bar chart on gang-related 
crimes as well as a data set that includes lati-
tude and longitude for data analysts to create 
maps that could display where there is gang 
activity in the area. Open data practices in 
policing can make substantial differences in 
how departments operate and ensure police 
departments receive their proper check and 
balance. In Oakland, Calif., use of force inci-
dents, citizen complaints and police shoot-
ings have decreased since the department 
began using body cameras. Washington D.C.’s 
mayor is developing a policy to ensure public 
access to body-cam video by allowing private 
citizens to obtain copies of video captured on 
street corners, during traffic stops and other 
outdoor areas.

Citizens would be able to access this data 

through a city’s open data portal. Using data 
analysis, data intermediaries can assist police 
departments in ensuring the data on the por-
tal is up to date, machine-readable and has 
context to explain the narrative behind the 
numbers. The information should be present-
ed not only on the open data portal, but also in 
PDF format to ensure that data literacy is not 
a barrier for residents to access and under-
stand this information. By releasing data, 
police departments are able to show positive 
trends in policing techniques while also being 
transparent about areas of improvement. Cit-
izens will be equipped with up-to-date and 
accurate evidence to hold their department 
accountable for any discrepancies in depart-
ment practices.

Information empowers people and drives 

innovation. Open data practices in policing 
can make substantial differences in policing 
practices and interactions between the police 
and community members. Police depart-
ments in the state of Michigan can be leaders 
in responding to the growing nationwide call 
to make police data publically accessible by 
joining the Police Data Initiative. Open data 
allows citizens and police officers to work 
collaboratively and authentically to keep 
communities in Michigan safe.

CHRISTINA MONIODIS | VIEWPOINT

Over the 14 years since 9/11 — dat-

ing back to when I was turning 14 
years old — it’s been hard for me to 
distinguish between what develop-
ments were the result of a changing 
nation and what were just part of the 
natural course of a girl growing up. 
The 9/11 terrorist attacks and adoles-
cence coalesced so as to muddle my 
interpretation of that day and its con-
sequences. But it was clear that after-
ward, things changed. For a while, I 
was fooled and believed this change 
to be merely an effect of growing 
up, amounting to paperwork, busy-
ness and evolving inventions. But it 
was something more. It’s possible I 
was just old enough, yet just young 
enough, to feel it.

I was beginning my sophomore 

year of high school in Metro Detroit. 
The president and I were both sit-
ting in school that day. At mine, the 
news of the World Trade Center and 
Pentagon aired on TV, but it seemed 
fictional — impossible to process. 
The splinters bursting from the tow-
ers seemed much less real than those 
breaking off my aging public school 
desk. But soon my world would be 
deluged with procedure and policy, 
making it quite real: school security 
officers became prison guards, prop-

erly packing a carry-on bag became a 
required life skill, telephone anten-
nas and cords became leashes. Each 
technological “upgrade” amplified 
an inescapable surveillance.

This progression to a surveillance 

state made it easier for our country to 
impose structure and accountability, 
but such constant policing posed its 
own problems. We became accus-
tomed to a culture lacking privacy, 
such that we addictively share all 
aspects of ourselves through social 
media. Afraid to be alone, we’ve 
embraced 
constant 
connectivity. 

Ultimately, an attachment to sleep-
less keepers — both NSA watchmen 
and phone companions — devel-
oped. This attachment diverts and 
stunts personal growth. It created 
a stifling order with no room for 
introspection on issues such as war, 
loss of life and moral principles. 
It is in this stifling order that I see 
what was fundamentally lost by our 
nation: solitude. This loss was a shift 
in our nation’s consciousness. 

Privacy and anonymity now feel 

criminalized, as if we must account 
for every action and thought. The 
sentiment permeates popular culture 
such that posting images and having 
social media followers is paramount. 

Are these not the same shadows that 
Plato warned against in his Allegory 
of the Cave? Can one “know thyself” 
so tethered? To participate as citi-
zens, we must see reality. Disconnect 
from chains and venture out alone 
from the cave to seek natural light 
and truth. Solitude, in its quiet inde-
pendence, offers us that chance. 

I recall riding a bicycle as a little 

girl on my grandma’s Michigan 
farm. Taking turn after turn down 
the gravel road in a hand-me-down 
jacket hanging below my knees, on 
a mission as if to find Narnia — until 
realizing I had become lost. Bright, 
open farmland surrounded me, and 
only brown and yellow fall leaves 
shuffled about. I needed to find 
Wright Road, the old road named 
after my family who settled on the 
empty land. No gadgets to guide me 
and no one watching. Panic turned 
to inspiration. I kept pedaling and 
exploring. The air tasted fresh. It felt 
as though I had pedaled to the pin-
nacle of freedom. Now, accustomed 
to the shackles of connectivity, I 
wonder if I’d be brave enough to do 
something so simple.

Dear new and returning students,
We at the Spectrum Center are so excited 

to welcome you all to (or back to) campus. At 
the Spectrum Center, we work with the cam-
pus community on providing support, build-
ing community and offering education around 
gender and sexuality. This academic year will 
no doubt be a time of learning and growth, 
both in and out of the classroom. University of 
Michigan students come from so many differ-
ent backgrounds, ideologies and identities, and 
yet something we all share is the fact that we 
are Wolverines. As Wolverines, we try to work 
together to build a community of respect, safe-
ty, learning and compassion.

At the core of the Spectrum Center’s mission 

is working toward the goal of building resourc-
es so that everyone on our campus feels sup-
ported in their own unique experience of their 
identities throughout their time at the Univer-
sity. With sexual orientation, gender identity 
and gender expression as our framework, we 
are committed to enriching your campus expe-
rience and developing students as individuals 
and community members.

We strive to make our office a welcoming and 

inclusive space where you can study, peruse the 
Jim Toy Library, use the David Bohnett Cyber 
Center, hold group meetings or just hang out. 

We host tons of great events throughout the 
year, including educational trainings, mentor-
ship, volunteer and leadership opportunities. 
Check out our website for more details.

As you unpack your last box, start your first 

homework assignments and begin to find your 
community on campus, we hope you will think 
of us. We invite you to drop by the Spectrum 
Center office on the third floor of the Michi-
gan Union for a visit. We’d love to get to know 
you, help you find ways to get involved in our 
work and learn how we can make your campus 
experience amazing. If online interaction is 
more your style, you can also connect with us 
on our website (spectrumcenter.umich.edu), 
via e-mail (spectrumcenter@umich.edu), by 
phone at 734-763-4186 or by social media (visit 
our website for links).

Finally, from 4 to 6 p.m. tonight we will 

be hosting our first ever “Queer Carnival” at 
Regents Plaza (look for the big, spinning cube).
There will be carnival snacks, games and a 
chance to connect with LGBTQ faculty and 
staff, as well as friends and allies. We hope to 
see you there.

Wishing you all an exciting and rewarding 

year and Go Blue,

Spectrum Center staff

By ADAM THEISEN

Daily Music Columnist

The biggest, loudest gust of 

a saxophone you’ve heard since 
the ’80s blows through your 
speakers over 
an anthemic 
synth 
foundation. 
Enter 
the 

steady 
bass 

drum, a calm 
taking 
over 

as the singer 
quietly 
muses 
on 

running 
away, escaping everything with 
one special person, until all of 
a sudden everything rises into 
a firework of ecstatic release. 
Like a gunshot she announces 
all of her desires, dreams, loves, 
goals and glories. “Baby! Take 
Me! To The! Feeling!” belts the 
singer of “Call Me Maybe.” “I’ll 
be your sinner in secret!” shouts 
2012’s 
viral 
sensation, 
new 

architect of “Run Away With 
Me,” 2015’s greatest pop song.

Yes, this was the summer of 

Carly Rae Jepsen.

Please, I promise you I’m not 

kidding. I swear that Carly Rae 
Jepsen’s third studio album 
Emotion is a real thing and that 
it will absolutely blow your 
mind. It’s 12 songs (18 if you 
get all the bonus tracks) of the 
greatest pop music that will 
ever grace your ears. From the 
demolishing power of opening 
track “Run Away With Me” 
through all of its dancefloor 
grooves and songs about puppy 
love and boy problems and 
timeless giddy adventures that 
could happen in any city on 
Earth.

And yet, nobody seemed to 

notice. Lead single “I Really 
Like You” scored buzz with 
its 
Tom-Hanks-starring 

music video and sugary sweet 
bubble-gum chorus, but that 
song feels long dead in popular 
consciousness. You’ll find some 
true CRJ believers on Tumblr 
or on some non-pretentious 
music blogs, but Emotion only 
hit #16 on the Billboard 200, 
and at the time of this writing, 
after only two weeks since 
its release, the album has 
completely fallen off the iTunes 

200, placing it behind records 
like Linkin Park’s Meteora and 
The Essential Billy Joel.

Why the hell did Emotion 

not sell? I understand, to some 
people, Carly Rae Jepsen trying 
to be culturally relevant in 2015 
is almost as absurd as if Rebecca 
Black were still releasing music, 
and Emotion did come out into 
a crowded pop landscape still 
dominated by Taylor Swift, 
Drake, Beyoncé, Nicki Minaj, 
One Direction, Ed Sheeran, Dr. 
Dre and so many more. But this 
still would’ve been the perfect 
summer to hear all of Emotion 
on the radio. The Weeknd and 
Fetty Wap excluded, this was 
another terrible summer to be in 
a car without an aux cord, with 
the buzzkill of “See You Again,” 
the 
annoying-on-purpose 

melodies 
of 
“Cheerleader” 

and the last wheezing gasps of 
“Thinking Out Loud” all getting 
way too much play.

Any 
song 
on 
Emotion 

would’ve been a perfect hit. “I 
Really Like You” already came 
and went as the lead single — 
part novelty with its easy chorus 
of “I really really really really 
really really like you,” part 
extremely true reflection on 
the euphoria of a crush. But you 
could get 12 people to listen to 
this album and each one would 
probably name a different key 
song. The title track’s effortless 
disco groove and jumpy synths 
make it a lovely throwback 
jam; the Sia assist on “Boy 
Problems” helps create a bubbly, 
carefree romp of a break-up 
song; “Making the Most of 
the Night” has giant energetic 
percussion and glittery bright-
light synths; and personally, I 
just love the way Jepsen seems 
to slip two syllables off the title 
phrase of the slinky, sassy “LA 
Hallucinations.” There’s no filler 
on Emotion, and this record is 
the rival of Taylor Swift’s 1989 in 
every way except sales numbers.

In keeping with the tradition 

of 
every 
tremendously 

underappreciated album having 
a curious backstory, Jepsen 
reportedly wrote over 200 songs 
for Emotion, meaning we’ve only 
heard, at most, 10 percent of the 
greatness she has to offer. She 
had sessions with Max Martin, 
of all people, and somehow the 
king of the charts for the last 
15 years couldn’t get a song to 
make the final cut. There’s even 
gold if you mine Emotion’s bonus 
tracks, with “I Didn’t Just Come 
Here to Dance” lighting up a 
room with its simple-yet-perfect 
mix of pure pop and EDM.

I caught wind of some of 

the Emotion buzz and found 
it online after it came out in 
Japan a full two months before 
its U.S. release (weird, right?). I 
don’t know exactly what I was 
expecting, but I found the rare 
pop record that holds up beyond 
dozens of spins, catchy music 
that lasts beyond the next Next 
Big Thing. I’ll admit that Carly 
Rae Jepsen isn’t exactly my 
idea of an artistic visionary, so 
I understand why so many are 
hesitant to embrace her, but 
I want Jepsen to have a large 
enough audience that we can 
hear everything she writes, and 
if I ever see her live, I’d love for 
it to be in a 15,000-seat arena, 
because that’s what her songs are 
built for. I’m worried, though: 
does intense, spontaneous fame 
for one summer mean that 
nobody will pay attention to 
her again? Did Jepsen wait too 
long to capitalize on her sudden 
ubiquity, losing her chance at 
superstardom forever?

All I know is that Emotion is 

undeniably the pop album of the 
year. Listening to it, it’s obvious 
how much work and effort 
Jepsen put into make a coherent, 
valuable collection of music, but 
it all feels so natural. I never 
hear Jepsen break a sweat as she 
swirls through, delivering songs 
that should appeal to every age 
and demographic. Even if I never 
heard it on the radio, everything 
on its tracklist is my song of the 
summer.

Theisen obviously didn’t hear 

“Hotline Bling.” To send him that 

fire, e-mail ajtheis@umich.edu.

‘Key and Peele’ ends 
its remarkable run

ADAM 

THEISEN

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

2015 has not been a great 

year for Comedy Central, which 
has faced a major talent exodus 
throughout the 
year. While we 
did know about 
the ending of 
“Kroll 
Show,” 

the 
sudden 

departure 
of 

Jon 
Stewart 

from 
“The 

Daily Show” in 
Augustand the 
short-notice 
announcement 
in July about 
the 
ending 
of 
their 
long-

running sketch comedy “Key & 
Peele” came as a surprise to the 
industry. While it never had the 
highest ratings, “Key & Peele” 
was a hugely important show 
for Comedy Central, especially 
because it was the first in a 
series of sketch series that 
started a creative renaissance-
of-sorts 
at 
the 
network 

(others 
that 
have 
followed 

in its footsteps include the 
highly-regarded “Inside Amy 
Schumer” and “Broad City”). 
In losing the show, created and 
written by Keegan Michael Key 
and Jordan Peele (“MADtv”), it 
loses the two voices who helped 
the network build its identity 
and helped make television a 
more diverse place.

What made “Key & Peele” 

astounding was the range of 
sketches that the show created 
during its four-season run. 
They varied from fun to dark 
and utterly ridiculous to making 
serious points about real life 
and politics. Probably their 
most 
well-known 
recurring 

political sketch involved Peele’s 
spot-on 
impersonation 
of 

Barack Obama and Key playing 
his “anger translator” Luther. 
Throughout the show’s run, the 
characters were used to skewer 
everyone from Mitt Romney to 
the Republican Congress. (Just 
to show how far the character 
became integrated into pop 
culture, Key even appeared 
in-character at the White House 
Correspondent’s Dinner and did 
a bit with President Obama.)

However, some of “Key & 

Peele” ’s best sketches were 
some of its weirdest, aided by 
the show’s darker turn in the 
first half of its fourth season. 
A great example of this is the 
sketch “Aerobics Meltdown,” 
where Key and Peele play two 
dancers competing in an 80’s 
style dance-off when Key’s 
character 
gets 
some 
news 

that his wife and child are in 
the hospital after an accident 
via cue card from the stage 
manager. Like the brilliant 
Urkle Sketch from the same 
season, it kept pushing in a more 
twisted direction as it goes on, 
subverting expectations in a 
strangely hilarious way.

However, what really made 

“Key & Peele” special was that 
it wasn’t afraid to touch on the 
subjects of race and deal with 
the intolerance which African 
Americans face in this country 
today. The show tackled these 
issues. Take the sketch from the 
series finale, “Negrotown,” for 
example. In it, Key is arrested 
by a white cop and hits his head 
on the way into the car. After 
the hit, he’s introduced through 
song-and-dance 
by 
Peele’s 

homeless man character to a 
kind-of paradise where racism 
doesn’t exist. At the core of 

the sketch is important social 
commentary about the state of 
racism, and via the unexpected 
vehicle of a catchy tune, the 
show finds a way to present it in 
a new and engaging manner.

This last type of sketch will 

probably what will define “Key 
& Peele” ’s legacy, which is why 
it’s fitting that “Negrotown” was 
the show’s last regular sketch in 
a finale that, with the exception 
of the last few minutes, felt like 
a normal episode of the comedy, 
with a series of funny sketches 
involving Peele as Ray Parker Jr. 
(the singer of “Ghostbusters”) 
singing 
on-the-nose 
themes 

from other movies and Key 
falling in love with a woman on 
the who’s passed out sidewalk 
while 
Peele’s 
911 
operator 

directs 
him 
though 
saving 

her life. These sketches are 
representative of what the show 
did so well: seemingly random, 
but always hilarious comedy 
bits. The last moments took a 
turn in a more retrospective 
direction. There was a fun gag 
reel which revisited some of the 
show’s best sketches, and the 
answer to where the two were 
driving during their talking 
head segments (finding the 
right place to scream “I said 
bitch!” in a callback to their 
first sketch).

As a whole, television is a less 

fun place without “Key & Peele,” 
and, more crucially, television 
is a less diverse place without 
“Key & Peele” and its social 
commentary. Even though this 
isn’t the end of Key and Peele’s 
professional relationship (they 
have a movie “Keanu” which 
releases in April), the world of 
Comedy Central, and TV as a 
whole, will feel emptier without 
new episodes of their show.

COMEDY CENTRAL

“One of us likes football.”

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Style Columnist

As 
a 
partially 
irrational, 

wholly self-indulgent 19-year-
old college girl, I know a thing 
or two about 
omanticizing 
people, 
places 
and 

ideas. When 
I 
stumbled 

upon 
My 

Paris Dream, 
Kate 
Betts’ 

enchanting 
memoir 
of 

the 
post-

collegiate 
Parisian caper that eventually 
catapulted her fashion career, 
my annual summer malaise went 
into overdrive — you can only 
watch “Midnight in Paris,” live-
stream haute couture shows and 
eat TeaHaus macaroons so many 
times before you’re hankering 
for 
the 
real 
thing. 
Betts’ 

storied soirée along the Seine 
accelerated my own, unoriginal 
Paris dreams.

As the winter semester died 

down, I opted to spend my 
impending 
summer 
in 
Ann 

Arbor. I figured I could conquer 
my nasty Natural Science credits, 
save up (to buy overpriced Fall 
footwear, probably) and edit the 
collective lovechild that is Daily 
Arts. And then, just as I’d felt live 
streaming the recent Valentino 

haute couture show, the FOMO 
ran deep, because deep in the 
soul a palm reader once told me 
I had, I felt as if I wasn’t where 
I was supposed to be. In that 
particular case, I needed to be 
in Rome’s Piazza Mignanelli, 
admiring the label’s extensive 
history rendered even richer 
by the collection’s Neapolitan 
pastels and marine motifs. Yet 
in the greater scheme of my 
Francophile existence, I was 
desperate for the experiences 
I’ve never had, the culture I’ve 
never explored, the learning 
my sartorial psyche has yet to 
absorb … I longed for the Champs 
Élysées. Sorry, Main Street.

I started alternating my stalk 

sessions between Facebook and 
Instagram, primarily those of 
my 
University 
acquaintances 

who were living out not only my 
Paris dream, but also my deep 
reveries of Rome, Barcelona and 
London during their spring study 
abroads.

And by the time I realized the 

seasonal wheels were in motion 
and I didn’t have enough cash 
to swing international travel 
(i.e. I spent too many paychecks 
on beaucoup de vin et fromage), 
I did the next best thing and 
bided my time with what I now 
refer to as the “non-annoying 
“Eat Pray Love”-esque fantasy”; 
I picked up Betts’ memoir — a 
petite gout de Paris.

As I tore through the pages, 

engrossing 
myself 
in 
the 

international exposures I’ve yet 
to experience, my subconscious 
surrendered 
to 
exhaustive 

wanderlust, (Case #1: maybe I 
didn’t actually need highlights 
and the faintly orange tint of 
Jergen’s, I just yearned for the 
sun-kissed cascades and bronzed 
glow that only a Brittany beach 
can 
provide). 
Betts 
painted 

the picture of the holiday I’ve 
always wanted — one of plenty 
of croissants and French lovers, 
but primarily a fortuitous string 
of events leading to an impressive 
fashion resume … and besides, 
like her, “I was (am) in love with 
fashion and culture, specifically 
French culture.”

Her story begins with her 

graduation 
from 
Princeton 

in 1985, a time when her 
aspirations didn’t match up to 
the trite realities of her college 
companions. As a history buff, 
she toyed with the possibility 
of war correspondence, but was 
ultimately disconcerted with 
her future. She had no desire to 
rush into entry-level positions at 
advertising firms like J. Walter 
Thompson and rather opted 
for the extended education 
of 
a 
Français 
foray. 
The 

memoir opens with a wistful 
retrospective of her primary 
exposure to the city a few years 
back — how she was moved in 
ways she couldn’t comprehend, 
high off of delusions of glamour

and grandeur. She yearns for 
that potent je ne sais quois she 
knows she can’t find elsewhere. 
And so, as I wish I could, she 
flees to France.

She spends her days on the 

narrow 
streets, 
surveying 

the inherent chicness of the 
elusive 
Parisiennes, 
with 

panoptic nightly studies of the 
culture’s nuances, slang and 
mannerisms through the lens 
of her homestay family, the 
Deschamps — Bibiane and her 
husband Antoine, and their 
two enfants — Maxime and 
Guillemette. Yet perhaps the 
cocktail hour of gossip with 
Bibiane’s 
girlfriends 
is 
the 

most intriguing segment of her 
education.

Aside from the fact that any 

mention of careers or ennui of 
one’s daily minutia is absolutely 
off the table for discussion, the 
women possess an intoxicating 
allure that Betts’ can’t ignore. 
They’re walking hallmarks of 
stylish simplicity — fresh faced 
with a slash of red lipstick, 
dressed in perfectly tailored 
separates, sporting un-fussed 
coifs and topped off with minimal 
to no accessories — France’s 
quintessential, effortlessly chic 
breed of women.

I so desperately wanted to 

find a feminine, Française icon 
to guide me in my never-ending 
quest of stylish pursuits. But 
after a decent hour into the 
search, I knew it was far fetched.

And as I dwell on the minute 

details of my daily strolls along 
Main Street, I can’t help but 
recall the otherworldly, yet 
shockingly simple fashions I 
see each day. Sure I’ll return 
home to reread a chapter of 
Betts’ tale, transporting myself 
into a realm of chicness, class 
and champagne I can’t help 
but covet; but I take her tokens 
of truth and find my dreams of 
Paris in the stylish absurdism 
of the brazen Ann Arborites. 
I may not always have Paris, 
but for now, I have my quirky 
counterparts.

TV REVIEW


took years. Mody said research-
ers hope to ultimately cut this 
time down to three weeks.

The study used new tech-

nology called Next-Generation 
DNA Sequencing to sequence 
a patient’s tumor’s DNA and 
RNA, as well as their normal 
genome. The genome is the 
complete set of genetic infor-
mation inside a cell. Through 
comparing the tumor’s genome 
and 
the 
normal 
genome, 

researchers were then able to 
identify the source of the can-
cer and any potential difficul-
ties the patient could facing 
during treatment.

Out of the entire study, the 

doctors found that 46 percent 
of patients had “actionable 
findings,” from the sequencing. 
However, they were only able 
to take action with 25 percent 
of the total number of patients.

“Just because you have this 

information where you know 
what you can do does not mean 
you can do something,” Mody 
said. “Sometimes there are no 
drugs available, the patient is 
too sick, there are no clinical 
trials available, there are no 
small tablets available for chil-
dren, etcetera.”

John 
Maris, 
a 
pediatric 

oncologist at the Children’s 
Hospital of Philadelphia who 
published an editorial along-

side the study, told HealthDay 
that an additional challenge 
for treatment was that drug 
companies are also reluctant to 
study children.

“There’s a fear of the drugs 

being more toxic in children,” 
Maris told HealthDay.

Of the 25 percent of patients 

treated, doctors were able to 
change an original diagnosis, 
begin early treatment on fam-
ily members for prevention or 
change 
treatment 
strategies 

entirely.

According to Mody, in at 

least 10 percent of the patients, 
the team was able to produce 
six months of remission or 
symptom relief.

“I think one of the things 

that people lose sight of is that 
10 percent either sounds large 
or small, depending on what 
you know about the patients,” 
he said. “These are patients for 
whom there is nothing else out 
there. These people have tried 
everything that they’ve wanted 
to try, so these are the worst of 
the worst cases.”

Moving forward, he said, 

the biggest challenges include 
decreasing the time it takes 
to begin treatment, producing 
more drugs that are available 
for young children and increas-
ing the availability of clinical 
drug trials.

“This is a seminal and land-

mark study, but there’s a lot 
more work to be done,” Mody 
said.

HEART
From Page 1A

Thursday’s 
meeting 
comes 

as administrators continue to 
emphasize the dire need for cul-
ture change in the Greek commu-
nity — a point with which Blake 
Jones opened the conversation.

“I’m hoping tonight will be 

remembered as a turning point 
when the Greek community came 
together, reinforced and recog-
nized its positive attributes, con-
tributions and influence and was 
willing to thoughtfully reflect and 
consider the need for significant 
changes in the community,” Blake 
Jones said.

In particular, administrators 

said they fear the impact of Greek 
life-organized parties on the Uni-
versity’s image.

Blake Jones said the popularity 

of the 2012 “I’m Shmacked” video 
— which showcased and glorified 
the party scene featuring Univer-
sity students — ultimately casts 
a shadow over the institution. 
The result: potential students are 
drawn in for the wrong reasons or 
others are turned off for fear of a 
wild social scene.

This was a point that Mary Jo 

Desprez, director of Wolverine 
Wellness, spoke to in an exclu-
sive interview with The Michigan 
Daily on Sept. 4. She said balanc-
ing this kind of negative picture of 

the University with more positive 
messages that better reflect the 
school’s values is increasingly dif-
ficult in the digital age.

“The one thing that’s differ-

ent today that we didn’t have to 
deal with 10 or 15 years ago is the 
24/7 instant visual of party,” she 
said. “For those of you who saw 
‘I’m Shmacked’ and how quickly 
that went around and how many 
views it got — now you’re a 10th 
grader looking at the schools you 
want to go to and you type in the 
University of Michigan. U of M’s 
admissions tour had like 70,000 
(views) and the ‘I’m Shmacked’ 
had 800,000 ... so who’s doing 
your recruiting and does that 
change the way people decide to 
come to schools?

“That might have been 1,000 

students in that video, but we 
have 43,000 students here and 
now you have a video that we’ll 
never be able to get rid of that 
sort of shows our campus, but it 
shows this one teeny-tiny bit of 
the story,” Desprez added. “We’ll 
never get that sort of traction 
with any counter story.”

The virality of “I’m Shmacked” 

seems to be representative of 
what Schlissel sees as an increas-
ingly poor understanding of what 
it means to have “fun” at school. 
Referencing his roles as a father 
and, previously, a practicing doc-
tor, Schlissel emphasized the neg-
ative effect the party climate can 

have on students’ health.

“I don’t like the idea that we 

measure how good or bad a week-
end was by how many of you 
ended up in an ambulance taken 
to our emergency room,” he said. 
“That’s not how we should mea-
sure how good a time we are hav-
ing.”

According to the Campus Cli-

mate Survey taken last year and 
released over the summer, stu-
dents involved in Greek life have 
a 40-percent higher chance of 
experiencing sexually assault.

At the meeting, E. Royster 

Harper, vice president for student 
life, stressed that the percep-
tion of Greek life on campus isn’t 
always positive.

“There are others in the com-

munity that see your behavior as 
racist and homophobic and sexist 
and unsafe,” she said. “Some see 
you as giving back to the commu-
nity and others see you as suck-
ing the life out of the community. 
Some see only the worst in you 
and others only the best.”

Schlissel 
said 
the 
issues 

described are best dealt with 
at the student-leadership level 
because students are more will-
ing to cooperate with the changes 
if they are promoted by fellow 
members of Greek life.

He noted, however, that the 

problems don’t have a short-term 
solution.

“They’re culture problems,” 

Schlissel said. “They’re aspects of 
how our culture and our behavior 
line up with our values and who 
we think we are — who we say we 
are.”

A turning point for 

Greek life

Blake Jones said the need for 

a turning point for Greek life has 
been on the horizon for some 
time, and that the problems were 
evident for many years prior to 
the high-profile Treetops ski trip 
incident in January.

Over the summer, administra-

tors began taking steps to curb 
these incidents by developing 
a task force composed of four 
leaders from the four branches 
of the Greek community: LSA 
senior Alex Krupiak, Interfrater-
nity Council president; Business 
senior Maddy Walsh, Panhel-
lenic Association president; LSA 
senior Reid McManus, National 
Pan-Hellenic Council president; 
and LSA senior Kelly Gee, Mul-
ticultural Greek Council presi-
dent.

At February’s meeting of the 

University’s Board of Regents, 
Walsh said leaders from the 
Greek community were plan-
ning to work with the University 
to shift Greek life culture. Dur-
ing Thursday’s event, Walsh told 
the assembled crowd that the 
taskforce had created a plan to 
improve the reputation of Greek 
life members on campus.

The first part of the plan 

requires all Greek organizations 
to participate in the Achievement 
Expectations 
Program, 
which 

mandates that all chapters record 
and submit to the University their 
philanthropic and service hour 
achievements. Walsh noted that 
last year, Greek students raised 
roughly $150,000 of the $450,000 
raised for charity.

Walsh also addressed concern 

over social life and the Greek 
system. She recommended chap-
ters reduce the size and visibility 
of their parties to downplay the 
association between parties and 
Greek life. She said this reduces 
the liability and risk of host-
ing many potentially non-Greek 
students, who could be the ones 
destroying 
the 
reputation 
of 

Greek life.

Another suggestion: reduce the 

amount of hard liquor at Greek 
parties.

Gee, the Multicultural Greek 

Council 
president, 
said 
the 

Greek community is working 
to improve diversity and inclu-
sion. Until this meeting, the four 
branches of Greek life did not 
ever meet together for this type 
of discussion. Next year, a Greek 
life Diversity and Inclusion task-
force will be launched for that 
purpose.

Walsh said compared to other 

universities nationwide, the Uni-
versity’s practices for dealing 

with alcohol and other behavioral 
issues appear fairly advanced.

“We 
contacted 
universities 

across the country and found, to 
some extent, we are above the 
curve,” Walsh said. “Campuses 
with problematic Greek life com-
munities are implementing sober 
monitors and social behavior poli-
cies which are things our Greek 
community at Michigan has had 
since the early 1990s.”

Frequent, loud coughs echoed 

throughout the auditorium and 
were regarded by several speak-
ers as a purposeful disruption and 
show of disrespect.

As Schlissel spoke, members 

coughed so loudly that Harper, 
the following speaker, said while 
she rarely is intimidated by a large 
crowd, the negative atmosphere 
created by the coughing made her 
rethink her words.

Administrators 
weren’t 
the 

only ones to comment on the 
behavior. Krupiak, IFC president, 
noted the display in his final com-
ments.

“Think for a second about 

how much your chapter means 
to you,” Krupiak said. “I know 
it means a hell of a lot to me … 
But when students sit here and 
blatantly disrespect the leaders 
of our University and fellow stu-
dents like myself and the three 
behind me, it’s flat-out embar-
rassing to say I’m a member of 
Greek life today.”

By KATIE CONKLIN 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

soccer team’s style is all about 
keeping possession. Thursday 
night against Central Michigan, 
the players remained collected 
as they effortlessly connected 
pass after pass, knowing their 
next move 
far before 
the 
ball 

landed 
at 

their feet.

It was with this fluidity that 

the Wolverines scored their 
third and final goal of the game, 
putting them on top, 3-1.

With the Wolverines up 2-0 

in the 64th minute, Central 
Michigan midfielder Eliza Van 
de Kerkhove got her foot on a 
bobbled ball at the top of the 
18-yard box and sent it just over 
the head of Michigan sophomore 
goalie 
Megan 
Hinz. 
The 

Chippewas were within one.

However, Michigan (5-2) was 

unfazed. Winning 50-50 balls 
in the midfield, the Wolverines 
settled down the speed of play 
while 
keeping 
possession, 

waiting for their opportunity to 
break through their opponent’s 
defense.

And in the 77th minute, that’s 

just what Michigan did.

Freshman 
forward 
Abby 

Kastroll controlled the ball 
along the goal line, saw a hole 

in the Chippewas’ defense and 
slipped the ball through the 18 
to the foot of senior forward 
and 
co-captain 
Corinne 

Harris. With one touch, Harris 
redirected the ball into the back 
left corner of the net to seal the 
Wolverines’ victory.

“Defensively, we just never 

gave up,” Kastroll said. “Finally, 
we got forward and got one in 
the back of the net. That slowed 
the game down and gave us 
more confidence.”

Outshooting 
Central 

Michigan, 24-4, it was obvious 
that Michigan’s forwards rose 
to the occasion. However, the 
Wolverines’ defensive unit was 
more important to the win than 
the scoring may indicate.

“We’re able to keep the ball 

in the back, and that opens 
opportunities further up the 
field,” said Michigan coach Greg 
Ryan. “As the other team comes 
high, we can begin to slip balls 
in behind.”

Using this tactic, Michigan 

held the ball from Central 
Michigan (1-3-1) for the majority 
of the first 20 minutes of the 
game before the Wolverines 
knocked in their first goal.

Sophomore 
forward 
and 

leading scorer Taylor Timko 
took full advantage of a rebound 
off of a Chippewa defender, 
hammering Central Michigan’s 
remains towards the far right 
post. Timko clenched her fist in 

celebration before the ball even 
hit the net, knowing the shot 
was clearly out of reach of any 
deflection.

Less than 10 minutes later, 

Kastroll capitalized on a failed 
clear by Central Michigan. 
Taking a right-footed volley, 
Kastroll pummeled the ball 
toward the far left post, putting 
Michigan up 2-0 going into the 
half.

With all three Michigan 

goals 
scored 
by 
different 

players, the Wolverines put 
their depth on display. And the 
first seven games this season 
have proved that any Michigan 
player in the offensive third is 
a threat.

“It’s nice to know that all of 

your teammates are there to 
support you and can all come in 
and make a difference,” Kastroll 
said. “When you have a lot of 
goalscorers, it’s really hard to 
defend.”

Michigan needs to continue 

such ruckus as they head into 
the weekend, where they will 
take on their first ranked 
opponent of the season in No. 13 
Notre Dame.

“We’re a very good team, 

(Notre Dame’s) a very good 
team,” Ryan said. “We’re gonna 
play our style, they’re gonna 
play theirs.”

Given 
Thursday’s 
result, 

Ryan’s style is working just 
fine.

Offense keys victory

Wolverines took 

advantage of 
opportunities 
Thursday night

By BETELHEM ASHAME 

Daily Sports Writer

“Defense 
wins 

championships” is a common 
mantra in sports. However, 
it’s the offense that has been 
the driving force behind the 
Michigan 
women’s 
soccer 

team’s successful start to the 
season.

In 
Thursday 
night’s 
3-1 

victory 
against 
Central 

Michigan 
(1-3-1), 
Michigan 

continued 
its 
impressive 

offensive stretch. With first-half 
goals by sophomore forward 
Taylor Timko and freshman 
midfielder Abby Kastroll, and 
a second-half goal by senior 
Corinne Harris that sealed 
the win for the Wolverines, 
Michigan (5-2) demonstrated 
its ability to consistently put the 
ball in the back of the net at any 
point during a given match.

Creating 
a 
multitude 
of 

scoring opportunities has been 
one of Michigan’s dominant 
traits so far this season. The 
Wolverines were leading the 
Big Ten in shots per game 
(21.5), points per game (9.0), 
goals per game (3.17) and 
corner kicks per game (8.67) 
heading into Thursday’s game. 
They had also outshot their 
opponents by a 129-39 margin, 
and they continued that trend 

by outshooting the Chippewas, 
24-4. According to Timko, that 
is part of the game plan.

“(Michigan coach Greg Ryan) 

is so encouraging. He believes in 
every single one of our abilities,” 
Timko said. “Game by game, his 
confidence in us is becoming 
more evident, which plays into 
our confidence in ourselves. 
Anyone has the capability to 
take people on in the box, turn, 
take a shot or score a goal.”

Ryan 
echoed 
a 
similar 

sentiment when describing the 
amount of freedom he allows 
his players on offense and the 
level of trust he has in their 
decision-making.

“Once the ball is in their 

hands up there, they’re going 
to do what they think is best,” 
Ryan said. “We have a basic 
structure 
of 

two 
strikers 

with 
one 

normally 
coming 
underneath 
to 
receive 

the ball and 
the 
other 

trying to get 
in behind to 
create 
lanes 

for 
Taylor 

and Abby and Corinne to run 
through; however, once they 
get in, it’s their decision, and I 
think they’re doing really, really 
well.”

Timko, a potential breakout 

star who entered the game 
tied for second in the Big Ten 
in points (11) and goals (five), 
added a sixth goal with the 
opener in Thursday’s match. 

As one of the catalysts behind 
the 
Wolverines’ 
dominant 

offensive performance to start 
the season, she credited their 
teamwork and selflessness for 
her offensive outburst.

“None of my goals would 

have happened without the 
hard work of the girls around 
me that comes before the final 
pass,” Timko said. “A lot of my 
goals have been off of crosses 
and little combinations in the 
box. It’s the continuous effort 
from the goalie to the forward 
that makes everything happen.”

Despite the offense’s strength 

in generating chances, Ryan still 
sees room for improvement for 
the team in terms of capitalizing 
on each of those chances.

“It’s fantastic to create so 

many scoring chances by taking 

so many shots, 
but we’re not 
finishing 
a 

high 
enough 

percentage of 
them,” 
Ryan 

said. 
“We’re 

focusing 
on 

improving 
our 
finishing, 

because 
it’s 

critical that we 
do better with 

the chances we get.”

If 
Michigan 
succeeds 

in making the most of the 
opportunities it’s producing, 
its 
offense 
could 
go 
from 

potent to unstoppable. With a 
match-up against No. 13 Notre 
Dame coming up this weekend, 
that 
transformation 
could 

pay dividends for a team still 
growing.

After 29 years away, Jim Harbaugh returns to Michigan Stadium 
on Saturday as a head coach. He has downplayed the importance 
of the moment all week, but it will be a career milestone when 
he runs out of the tunnel before the game. His Wolverines face 
another Pac-12 foe this week, this time as favorites looking for 
their first win against Oregon State.

Breakdown: Michigan has the upper hand 
against Oregon State in the home opener on 
Saturday.

Utah (Sept. 3): Well, at least the mountains 
were cool?

Oregon State (Sept. 12): Michigan will leave it 
to the Beavers to earn its first win.

Michigan State (Oct. 17): These teams play a 
week earlier than last year, which Mark Danto-
nio will take as a sign of blatant disrespect.

Minnesota (Oct. 31): Plot twist: Michigan plays 
Minnesota for the Little Orange Pumpkin.

Rutgers (Nov. 7): Will Michigan fans storm the 
field if the Wolverines avenge last year’s loss in 
Piscataway? We hope not.

UNLV (Sept. 19): Did you mean the University 
of Nevada-Loss Vegas?

Indiana (Nov. 14): Boring state. Hopefully not a 
boring game.

BYU (Sept. 26): We don’t know who will score 
more points, but we do know who will leave the 
game with more wives.

Maryland (Oct. 3): Rumor has it, if you stare at 
Maryland’s state flag for too long, you become 
absorbed into the pattern.

Northwestern (Oct. 10): Are you ready for 
M00N pt. 2: N00M?

Ohio State (Nov. 28): We wanted to make a 
joke, but the only one we could think of was, 
“Haha, your backup QB might win the Heisman.”

Penn State (Nov. 21): Christian Hackenberg 
could be a first-round pi — aaand, he just got 
sacked again.

‘M’ braces for Oregon State’s Collins

Wolverines will 

face another speedy 
quarterback in home 

opener Saturday

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Last Thursday, the Michigan 

football team got a stiff test for its 
run defense when it took on Utah 
and 
Devontae 

Booker, 
the 

Pac-12’s second-
leading 
rusher 

in 
2014. 
And 

on 
Saturday, 

when 
Oregon 

State 
visits 

Ann Arbor, the 
Wolverines will 
face yet another 
fleet-footed 
challenge.

In 
Jim 

Harbaugh’s first 
home game as 
head coach of 
the Wolverines, 
Michigan will try its hand at 
containing a quarterback who 
will be looking to run all game in 
Oregon State’s Seth Collins.

Against Utah, the Wolverines 

saw a healthy dose of Booker 
and kept him mostly in check 
for the first half. But they were 
burned by senior quarterback 
Travis 
Wilson, 
who 
sucked 

momentum out 
of the Michigan 
defense 
by 

scrambling 
to 

the tune of 12 
carries for 53 
yards 
and 
a 

touchdown.

Collins 
has 

played 
only 

one game in his 
career, but he 
was impressive 
on the ground, ripping off 152 
yards rushing on 17 attempts — 
a whopping 8.9 yards per carry. 
Then again, that performance 
came against Weber State, so the 
gaudy numbers don’t mean as 
much as they would have against 
a Football Bowl Subdivision team.

What the numbers do provide, 

though, is a glimpse of how 
Collins will try to beat the 
Wolverines 
(0-1). 
Throughout 

the Beavers’ opener, it was clear 
Collins would prefer to run 

when possible. He attempted 
just 18 passes, completing 10 for 
92 yards. So when he lines up 
against Michigan on Saturday, 
the Wolverines will need to have 
the QB contained at all times.

Fortunately for Michigan, its 

athletic linebackers should be up 
to the task. Seniors Joe Bolden, 
James Ross III and Desmond 

Morgan will bear 
the brunt of the 
responsibility 
in stopping the 
run, and if they 
can go sideline to 
sideline and keep 
Collins in front 
of them, they’re a 
solid bet to keep 
the Beavers (1-0) 
in check.

Outside 
of 

Collins, Oregon State also has a 
steady stable of backs who can 
carry the load as well. Storm 
Woods and Chris Brown combined 
for 117 yards on 29 carries against 
the Wildcats. Michigan’s run 
defense is expected to be its 
strength going forward, so if 
the Beavers’ trio of runners can 
produce, it could cause some 
alarm at the Big House.

But the Wolverines will have 

to be careful to not get caught 
watching for a run. Wednesday, 

Michigan defensive backs coach 
Greg Jackson cautioned that 
while the run game is clearly a 
focus for the Beavers, it can also 
be used as an effective decoy.

“We still think (when) there’s 

more runs, there’s more deep 
balls,” Jackson said. “So we’re 
going to come up and leverage all 
the players with safeties, but at 
the same time we’re going to be 
prepared for deep balls as well, 
because with the runs, there’s 
a whole bunch of play actions to 
come with it.”

Michigan is favored by more 

than two touchdowns in the home 
opener, and ESPN’s SportsCenter 
will be broadcasting from Ann 
Arbor, which is sure to energize 
the city. And in Harbaugh’s Big 
House debut, it’s a safe bet that 
the Wolverines will be fired up to 
face the Beavers, especially after 
last week’s season-opening loss.

“Some people walk right out of 

the locker room and they’re over 
(a loss),” Harbaugh said Monday. 
“I’m not one of those guys. It stays 
with me — I choose to have it stay 
with me, and in the mindset of 
our team, it’ll stay with us.

“There’s a bad taste in our 

mouth when you lose a football 
game 
and 
there’s 
only 
one 

mouthwash for that, and that is 
winning.”

Managing Sports Editor

REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. — 

David Sills IV sits at a desk in the 
den of his weekend home here, 
on a country club just a few miles 
from the beach. A table off to the 
side holds a laptop decorated with 
logos from several colleges, most 
prominently West Virginia, where 
his son, David V, is a freshman 
quarterback. He drinks out of a cup 
from Mississippi State, where his 
adopted son, Jahmere Irvin-Sills, 
now plays football.

Jahmere was a child at a youth 

football game when he learned his 
mother had been killed. He went 
into the witness protection pro-
gram and spent a year in North 
Carolina before returning to live 
with his grandfather in Delaware. 
Soon after he returned, his brother 
was killed in a house fire. The day 
his family continued to break apart, 
he started to form a new one when 
he met David Sills IV at a football 
practice facility nearby.

Years later, Jahmere won a skills 

combine, and he returned that 
night to learn that his grandfather 
had passed away. No good news 
came without a little bad.

Amid unbearable tragedy, Jah-

mere moved in with the Sills family, 
who later adopted him. Eventually, 
he changed his last name to Irvin-
Sills and earned his scholarship to 
Mississippi State.

Kids like Jahmere come around 

often in his hometown of Wilming-
ton, Delaware, near Eastern Chris-
tian Academy in Elkton, Maryland. 
Sills founded the school in 2012 as 
an all-online school intended ini-
tially for only football players.

There are no school plays, chess 

clubs or marching bands at Eastern 
Christian. The school exists with 
one goal — get kids off the streets 
and into college for free, using foot-
ball.

The model has been overwhelm-

ingly successful so far — Sills esti-
mates that in a graduating class of 
15, on average 13 will go to college 
for free — and it stretches to Ann 

Arbor, too. Michigan sophomore 
football players Freddy Canteen 
and Brandon Watson once called 
the troubled streets of Wilmington 
home, but they made it out.

Some kids from Wilmington 

struggle to find themselves. So they 
find Sills, they find coach Dwayne 
Thomas, they find Eastern Chris-
tian and they find other kids — role 
models like Canteen and Watson.

On a Saturday afternoon in late 

July, only Sills is at his Rehoboth 
Beach home for most of the after-
noon. It’s a “quiet day,” he says, 
which is unusual. The next day, his 
son and Canteen would be there 
after training together. Both his 
daughters would be there, too, as 
would Jahmere, and likely a bunch 
of their friends. The Sills have a 
dormitory-style room above the 
garage that can sleep 16. Sills refers 
to all of the kids as his own, and the 
family has been hosting them since 
before they founded Eastern Chris-
tian.

“I’m happy to be able to host 

them as much as I can,” Sills said. 

“I love the kids. I think they’re all 
good for each other.”

The kids agree. Watson said he 

used to drive a teammate to school 
and buy him lunch, hoping that 
teammate can now do the same 
for someone else. Canteen, while 
home from Michigan for a week 
this summer, went back to Eastern 
Christian and rode the bus with the 
team up to Camden, New Jersey, to 
watch their 7-on-7 workout.

Together, they serve as role 

models for the next group of kids 
looking to make something of 
themselves.

And so after growing up with lit-

tle reason to believe in their future, 
they end up with little reason not 
to.

* * *

The players at Eastern Christian 

come from all over, but most are 
from nearby New Castle County in 
Delaware, especially Wilmington. 
Wilmington is the largest city in 
Delaware, with 71,525 people as of 

2013. It is also one of the most dan-
gerous small cities in the country.

A Newsweek piece last Decem-

ber labeled it Murder Town, USA. 
According to the Wall Street Jour-
nal, last year’s 28 murders fell 
one shy of the record set in 2010 
and 2011. In 2013, the per-capita 
rate was more than four times the 
national average.

“As long as I’m around, we’re 

going to always be the least, the 
last and the left out,” Thomas said. 
“Because that’s what I was. Kids 
that need the most get the most.”

These kids come from a wide 

range of family situations. Some 
have single parents, some have par-
ents in jail, some have no parents. 
One, Angelo Blaxon, came from 
another high school in northern 
Delaware and grew up with his sis-
ter. His mother was a drug addict. 
His sister, though she was a “very 
strong, valued individual,” as Sills 
said, struggled to feed and raise 
Angelo, as he was 6-foot-5 and 300 
pounds. He started playing foot-
ball for Thomas at nearby Red Lion 

An unusual path to Michigan

COURTESY EASTERN CHRISTIAN ACADEMY

Michigan sophomore wide receiver Freddy Canteen graduated from Eastern Christian Academy in Elkton, Maryland, in 2014, after overcoming obstacles similar to many of his high-school teammates.

TheMichiganDaily, www.michigandaily.com

Christian Academy, and moved in 
with another family on the team.

He earned a full scholarship to 

Auburn, and his new family and 
Blaxon’s sister all came together 
last spring to see Blaxon drafted by 
the Tennessee Titans.

“This is a kid who could have 

been walking the streets of Wilm-
ington, Delaware, having drive-by 
shootings or doing drugs or what-
ever the case may be,” Sills said. 
“We have a lot of those situations.”

Some kids have fathers in jail 

for murder. Another’s father hung 
himself in prison.

“It’s a struggle,” Sills said, “and 

the school really is a ministry.”

Religion is a top priority at East-

ern Christian (a job advertisement 
on the school’s website requires 
applicants to be born-again Chris-
tians). On the sign in front of the 
school is a Bible verse, 1 Corinthi-
ans 9:24, which says, “Do you not 
know that in a race all the runners 

run, but only one gets the prize? 
Run in such a way as to get the 
prize.”

At Eastern Christian, they know 

they have to run faster to get that 
prize. But they succeed at an 
incredibly high rate. Sills estimated 
that out of 15 in a graduating class, 
13 will play football in college for 
free or virtually free.

And they come a long way from 

where they started in order to do it. 
Some kids come to school and don’t 
have any lunch, so the Sills family 
used to send extra food to school.

“Over the course of time, we get 

the kids that have been forgotten,” 
Sills said. “It just always makes you 
cry when you see some of the situ-
ations that some of these kids are 
in.”

* * *

As for Canteen and Watson, 

they know they’re relatively lucky. 
There’s a gamut of family situations 

at Eastern Christian, and Canteen 
and Watson were at the upper end 
of that spectrum, despite growing 
up in or just outside Wilmington. 
Their parents made sure they had 
everything they needed.

But the two players could always 

have gotten into trouble. They were 
right next to what Watson calls 
“the worst part” of town.

They know the future they have 

in front of them was never inevi-
table. They agree they wouldn’t be 
here if not for Eastern Christian, if 
not for their hard work, even if the 
ball had bounced differently. The 
world they left behind is a constant 
reminder.

“I knew kids, of course I knew 

kids,” Canteen said. “I had friends I 
grew up with that chose the wrong 
path. You’ve got to let those go.”

For both, the route was simple. 

They went to school from around 8 
a.m. until 2 p.m. on weekdays. Then 
came football practice, weight 

training, walkthroughs and extra 
workouts. On fall weekends, they’d 
travel to games all over the East 
coast. Then came more offseason 
training, and then camps to gain 
exposure to college coaches.

Canteen and Watson cleared 

every hurdle.

“They proved to me who they 

were through handling that ethic,” 
Thomas said. “Never complained. 
Them two? Never heard a peep out 
of them. Ever.”

Thomas coached Canteen and 

Watson starting in middle school, 
before Eastern Christian even 
existed. They worked year-round 
to get to this level. Watson became 
an interception machine, always 
finding himself around the ball 
when it was thrown. Though he 
hasn’t seen the field much at Michi-
gan, he showed a glimpse of his 
capabilities with an interception in

Canteen, meanwhile, worked 

with David Sills V relentlessly to 
develop chemistry to match his 
blazing speed. When Sills threw a 
back-shoulder fade, Canteen would 
know, and he’d adjust. When Can-
teen switched his route before the 
snap, Sills would know, and he’d 
adjust. Canteen has also played 
sparingly in the past year (in part 
due to a shoulder injury in camp), 
but the Michigan coaches have 
started using him on offense and 
defense, presumably to try to uti-
lize his speed.

“Those are two kids that get it,” 

Thomas said. “It’s not recreation 
for them. This is something that’s 
very, very special and near and 
dear to them. They both have those 
dispositions, which affords them 
the opportunity to challenge them-
selves.

young people are focused on other

Breakdown: ‘M’ vs. Oregon State

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

On a day that will in all 

likelihood be remembered as Jim 
Harbaugh’s Michigan Stadium 
coaching debut, there will indeed 
be a football game played after 
Harbaugh jumps up and touches 
the banner.

When the Michigan football 

team plays Oregon State on 
Saturday, it will mark a matchup 
between two head coaches at 
new schools. The Beavers’ Gary 
Andersen left Wisconsin after 
last season to take the helm in 
Corvallis. 

The 
Beavers, 
unlike 
the 

Wolverines, won their season 
opener, 
defeating 
Football 

Championship Subdivision foe 
Weber State, 26-7.

Here’s the Daily’s breakdown 

of the upcoming matchup.

Michigan pass offense vs. 

Oregon State pass defense

Members of the Wolverines’ 

offense 
said 
throughout 
the 

week that they see a great deal of 
potential in their unit. Saturday’s 
game will be their chance to 
prove it.

For 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback Jake Rudock, the 
key will be taking care of the ball. 
Rudock threw three interceptions 
against the Utes in his Michigan 
debut, a number that displeased 
him greatly.

Saturday 
will 
be 
another 

chance for Rudock to further his 
rapport with his receivers after 
transferring from Iowa over the 
summer. The process appeared 
to be going smoothly with junior 
tight end Jake Butt and redshirt 
junior 
wide 
receiver 
Amara 

Darboh, each of whom hauled 
in eight passes from their new 
quarterback in the opener.

Exactly how productive Oregon 

State’s defense will be against 
Rudock and company is difficult 
to predict. The Beavers return 
just two defensive starters and 
didn’t face much of a test against 
Weber State in their season 
opener. 
Wildcats 
quarterback 

Jadrian Clark completed 19 of 35 
passing attempts for 120 yards to 
go along with one interception 
against Oregon State.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan rush offense vs. 

Oregon State rush defense

Michigan 
junior 
running 

back De’Veon Smith was hard 
on himself after the Wolverines’ 
season-opening loss, saying he 
missed some holes that were 
the size of a bus. Smith finished 
the opener with 47 yards on 17 
carries, while junior backup Ty 
Isaac finished with 12 yards on 
four carries.

Michigan’s 
longest 
run 
of 

the game was just seven yards 
— hardly an explosion. Fifth-
year senior offensive lineman 
Graham Glasgow said Tuesday 
that he believes many of his 
unit’s problems can be solved by 
the linemen lowering their pad 
levels, something they have been 
working on all week.

Oregon State allowed 58 rushing 

yards on 18 attempts to Weber State 
in the opener, good for an average 
of 3.22 yards per carry.

Edge: Michigan

Oregon State pass offense vs. 

Michigan pass defense

Oregon State quarterback Seth 

Collins made his career debut in 
the team’s opener, completing 
10 of 18 attempts for 92 yards 
and two touchdowns. Collins is 
known primarily as a rushing 
threat, but Michigan will also be 
wary of his arm.

Michigan 
defensive 
backs 

coach Greg Jackson said this 
week that the Beavers’ emphasis 
on the running attack could 
potentially 
open 
up 
some 

opportunities for deep passes, 
putting the Wolverine defense 
on alert. Michigan’s secondary 
played with mixed results against 
Utah — they didn’t allow the Utes 
to break the game open, but there 
were certainly lapses in coverage.

Another area in which the 

Wolverine secondary hopes to 
improve is in creating turnovers. 
Michigan’s lone takeaway in the 
opener came on redshirt junior 
Jeremy Clark’s interception of a 
Hail Mary at the end of the first 
half. The Wolverines will have 
an opportunity to increase that 
number against an unseasoned 
quarterback.

Edge: Michigan

Oregon State rush offense 

vs. Michigan rush defense

The Beavers rushed for 281 

yards against Weber State, with 
Collins leading the way with 
152 yards on the ground. The 
Wolverines struggled to contain 
Utah quarterback Travis Wilson 
last week, who scampered for 53 
yards and one touchdown on 12 
carries.

However, Michigan did limit 

Devontae Booker, expected to 
be a top running back in the 
Pac-12, to 53 rushing yards and 
one touchdown on 12 carries. 
The Wolverines also made some 
big plays defending the run, 
recording nine tackles for a loss.

Edge: Michigan

Special Teams

Michigan 
fifth-year 
senior 

punter Blake O’Neill had a strong 
debut, with a long of 50 yards and 
another punt that pinned Utah 
within its own five-yard line. 
Senior kicker Kenny Allen missed 
one field goal in the opener to go 
along with one make.

Michigan redshirt freshman 

Jabrill Peppers will be a threat in 

the return game, both on punts 
and kickoffs. Though he was 
largely held in check against the 
Utes, he displayed electricity on 
his lone opportunity, returning 
a kick for 36 yards in the fourth 
quarter.

Oregon State kicker Garrett 

Owens was a perfect 4-for-4 in 
the opener, with a long kick of 45 
yards. Punter Nick Porebski, an 
Australian like O’Neill, punted 
six times for 226 yards last week.

Edge: Oregon State

Intangibles

Harbaugh’s home debut could 

provide the Wolverines an edge. 
The Michigan fan base has been 
waiting for this moment since 
Harbaugh’s hiring last December. 
Crisler Center erupted in a state 
of 
euphoria 
when 
Harbaugh 

was introduced on the day of his 
introductory press conference, 
and the Big House is sure to 
follow suit.

Edge: Michigan

What to watch for: Offensive line 
seeks breakthrough vs. Beavers

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

1. Can the offensive line 

finally improve?

With all five starters returning 

from 2014, the general sense was 
that this season would be the 
one when Michigan’s offensive 
line returned to the program’s 
bruising ways of old. That was 
half-true in Thursday’s loss to 
Utah.

The 
Wolverines 
kept 
the 

nation’s leader in sacks last 
season from getting to Rudock, 
but still failed to create holes 
in the running game. It didn’t 
matter if it was up the middle or 
to the outside or whether it was 
De’Veon Smith, Derrick Green or 
Ty Isaac. The junior backs only 
earned 2.6 yards per carry, far 
from a victorious formula.

“Of course we want to be better 

at rushing the football,” said 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. 
“And that comes with the interior 
line, and the interior line has 
got to play as an entire unit. We 
talked about it a little earlier, 
(the key is all 11 players) playing 
together and not one guy having a 
breakdown or missed block.”

The answer to the offensive 

line woes may have taken a hit 
early Thursday afternoon, when 
junior offensive tackle Logan 
Tuley-Tillman 
was 
dismissed 

from the team for what Harbaugh 
called “conduct unacceptable for 
a Michigan student athlete” in a 
statement. Though Tuley-Tillman 
was on the line’s second unit, the 
dismissal puts a large dent in the 
offensive line’s depth. Those still 
with the team will look to live up 
to their big expectations against 
another Pac-12 defensive front.

2. How will Michigan win 

the turnover battle?

Sometimes, 
even 
free 

sweatshirts 
in 
exchange 
for 

interceptions aren’t enough to 
get the Wolverines to win the 
turnover battle.

Last season, Michigan was 

124th out of 128 teams in the 
country 
in 
turnover 
margin, 

handing the ball over 16 more 
times than it took it. With eight 

defensive 
starters 
returning 

and (previously) turnover-proof 
gradute 
transfer 
quarterback 

Jake Rudock taking control of the 
offense, many expected the team 
to turn the tables and table the 
turnovers.

Instead, a Rudock pick-six — 

his third interception of the game 
— turned what could have been a 
Michigan game-
tying 
drive 

into a dagger 
by Utah, while 
the 
defense 

mustered 
a 

meaningless 
Hail 
Mary 

interception 
at the end of 
the first half. 
Though Rudock 
threw just five 
interceptions in 345 attempts last 
season, it took him just 31 throws 
to reach three for the Wolverines.

“I would like to see more 

aggressiveness in terms of the 
ball,” Harbaugh said. “Clubbing it, 

ripping it, getting it out, getting it 
over to our side. Be more handsy. 
Getting our hands on balls, 
whether they’re tips or (pass 
break-ups) or interceptions.”

Fortunately 
for 
Michigan, 

Utah had the 18th-best turnover 
margin 
among 
Power 
Five 

conference teams last season, 
and the Beavers didn’t. With 

less 
defensive 

pressure 
from 

Oregon 
State 

and 
a 
true 

freshman 
starting for the 
Beavers, 
the 

Wolverines will 
have 
a 
great 

chance to win 
the 
turnover 

battle for just 
the second time 

since 2013.

3. Can Michigan contain a 

spread offense?

Michigan’s defensive problems 

against the spread date all the 
way back to the Lloyd Carr era, 
but until they go away, no game 
is a cupcake for the Wolverines. 
Against Utah, Michigan allowed 
quarterback Travis Wilson, who 
didn’t earn the starting job until 
days before the game, to scramble 
for 53 yards on the ground — more 
than any Wolverine in the game.

Things 
don’t 
look 
much 

easier this week. True freshman 
quarterback 
Seth 
Collins 

scampered for 153 yards on 17 
carries in the Beavers’ 26-7 win 
over Weber State on Saturday. 
Michigan 
provides 
a 
much 

tougher test for Collins, but as 
Michigan fans know all too well, 
mobile quarterbacks from Ohio 
State to Appalachian State can 
wreak havoc in the Big House if 
given room to run.

“We’ve got to start playing 

more 
aggressively 
and 
stop 

waving and start going to attack 
the 
offenses,” 
said 
defensive 

backs coach Greg Jackson. “I 
don’t think we did that enough as 

a secondary last week.”

4. Will Michigan Stadium 

explode from Harbaugh fever?

This is the safest bet of all. You 

can be sure the biggest cheer of 
the game will be when the former 
quarterback 
officially 
returns 

to the Big House sidelines as a 
coach. ESPN’s SportsCenter has 
even traveled to Ann Arbor to 
broadcast live from the scene.

Though 
the 
coaches 
 
— 

including 
Harbaugh 
— 
have 

largely 
downplayed 
the 

homecoming event, Harbaugh’s 
son, 
tight 
ends 
coach 
Jay 

Harbaugh, admitted that after 
hearing about Michigan Stadium 
so much as a kid, his first game 
in Ann Arbor will be one to 
remember.

“I’m excited for it, I’m really 

excited for it,” Jay Harbaugh 
said. “I tell all these recruits 
about it, and I haven’t even 
experienced yet. It’s a one-of-a-
kind experience from what I’ve

things other than training, aca-
demics. … Because they are driven 
individuals, they didn’t mind the 
time they had to commit to this 
program in order to obtain or reach 
their goals.”

Back in high school, that work 

paid off when former Michigan 
assistant 
coach 
Curt 
Mallory 

noticed the two at a Michigan sum-
mer camp and recruited them.

Those camps ran well into the 

summer, and then it was time for 
training camp to prepare for anoth-
er season. Thomas and the staff at 
Eastern Christian didn’t leave time 
for anything else.

“I never really went to any par-

ties or anything,” Watson said. “I 
wanted to, but I was too tired. I had 
stuff going on the next day. There is 
no other choice.”

* * *

It hasn’t taken long for the play-

ers and staff at Eastern Christian to 
become confident in their model, 
to keep pursuing bright futures in 
spite of a bleak past. The school 
started in 2012, when nearby Red 
Lion Christian was sold to another 
church that de-emphasized athlet-
ics.

At that point, the football players 

(including Canteen, Watson and 
Sills), parents and coaches at Red 
Lion gathered and decided they had 

three options: They could each go 
their separate ways, staying at 
Red Lion or transferring to a new 
school of their choice. They could 
all transfer to the same school en 
masse. Or they could create a new 
school.

Of course, the latter of those 

three options presented the most 
challenges. They would need 
teachers, classes, approval from 
the state and a host of new admin-
istrative measures.

But that’s what they voted to do, 

and Eastern Christian was born.

“It was challenging, but it 

wasn’t like climbing Mount Ever-
est,” Sills said. “It was challenging, 
I’ll say that. It was a lot of work.”

Sills’ son still had three years 

of high-school eligibility left, and 
he had been offered a scholarship 
to Southern California at age 13. 
If the elder Sills had only his own 
son’s football interests in mind, 
he could have sent him anywhere, 
most likely Oaks Christian in Cali-
fornia, where he could work with 
private quarterback coach Steve 
Clarkson.

But Sills had his other sons, his 

adopted sons, to worry about too. 
To create a new school, take in 
underprivileged kids and travel 
around the country playing high-
school 
powerhouses 
required 

belief — belief in the staff, belief in 
the players and belief in the system.

If Sills, Thomas and the rest of 

the foundation of Eastern Chris-
tian didn’t have that belief, East-
ern Christian wouldn’t exist. And 
Freddy Canteen and Brandon Wat-
son don’t know where they’d be 
right now.

The new program at Eastern 

Christian needed a strong leader 
as coach, so when Sills founded the 
school, he brought Thomas with 
him. After growing up in Pater-
son, New Jersey, Thomas played 
at Northern Arizona and then 
coached at Montclair State, Ten-
nessee State and Delaware State.

A strong personality, Thomas is 

very philosophical and exceeding-
ly confident. He says North Jersey 
is becoming a recruiting hotbed, 
so he says he’ll take his team up to 
beat — not just play — some teams 
in North Jersey. Last week, they 
did, defeating Michigan safety 
Jabrill Peppers’ alma mater, Para-
mus Catholic, 42-20.

“There’s 
a 
cockiness 
here, 

where I think we can develop peo-
ple wherever,” Thomas says.

Just before Eastern Christian 

started, Thomas took a visit to the 
IMG Academy in Bradenton, Flor-
ida. Eastern Christian has drawn 
comparisons to IMG because of its 
strong focus on athletics and the 
criticism that it is too intense in 
that area. In fact, the schools will 
play each other in football next 
month.

During 
Thomas’ 
visit, 
the 

coach walked around the facil-
ity, had lunch and met with then-
IMG coach Chris Weinke. At the 
end of the visit, Thomas went to 
Weinke’s office and saw several 
of his players’ names on the wall. 

Weinke wanted them to transfer to 
IMG; Thomas said absolutely not. 
He offered Thomas a job; Thomas 
said absolutely not.

Weinke said if Thomas left Red 

Lion, he would never surface again.

“I said, ‘Yeah, we will,’ ” Thomas 

said. “You can drop me off in Bei-
jing, China, and in two years Nick 
Saban is gonna have (Chinese play-
ers) on Alabama’s team. Because 
we have a formula.”

That was the end of that conver-

sation.

Thomas is his serious about his 

coaching job. He believes he was 
called to do this. Years ago, his 
father told him the Confucius say-
ing that when you choose a job you 
love, you never work a day in your 
life.

He likes the intimacy of Eastern 

Christian’s program, where he gets 
to urge kids to realize their full 
potential. College coaches ask him 
when he’s going to return to col-
lege. He tells them he never will.

“At the end of the day, when we 

win, I feel like we just beat Ala-
bama,” Thomas said. “And when a 
kid gets a scholarship, it seems like 
we just won the national champi-
onship. I’ve had years where we get 
14 kids scholarships, so I won the 
national championship 14 times 
that year.”

Thomas came to Eastern Chris-

tian, taking the leap of faith along 
with everyone else, to keep teach-
ing lessons to the kids.

“You’re going to win some, 

you’re going to lose some and 
some are unfortunately going to 
get rained out,” he said. “But when 
there’s a lesson learned, you really 
don’t lose anything. That’s where 

the confidence comes from.”

* * *

Eastern Christian’s building sits 

in the bottom of an industrial park 
off Maryland’s Route 272. It shares 
the park with a closed sandwich 
shop, a fencing academy and a cork 
production plant, among other 
things. One has to pass a precious-
metal factory and an agricultural 
supplier to see the first sign of a 
high school, a lone tackling sled in 
the middle of a field of knee-high 
grass.

But inside the building at the 

bottom of the hill, it looks like a 
high school. The lobby is furnished, 
with flowers lining the front wall. 
Photos, trophies and other memen-
tos decorate another wall. A poster 
reads, “We Don’t Keep Calm. It’s 
Football Season.” Another lists four 
seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer 
and Football. Still another, “It’s not 
whether you get knocked down. It’s 
whether you get up.”

The staff hangs flags on the wall 

from all the schools former players 
have attended. Last year’s schools 
haven’t even gone up yet, and they 
already need a new wall.

“Good bunch of guys, man,” 

Thomas says. “We’re going to get 
15 kids to college every year. That’s 
our contribution to society.”

On the front desk, another stack 

of mail from interested schools has 
arrived for players. Thomas begins 
to sort through the schools: Yale, 
Army, Liberty, Maryland, Rutgers, 
UCLA, Michigan State, Kentucky.

He reaches the bottom of the 

stack, then sets it down, pauses and 
says, “We’ll be all right.”
