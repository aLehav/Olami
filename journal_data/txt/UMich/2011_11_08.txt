* ELECTION DAY 2011 *

A incumbents say
budget is priority

CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR CITY C

If re-elected, council
members want
to redirect funds
to public safety
By JENNIFER LEE
Daily StaffReporter
As Ann Arbor residents head
to the polls today to vote in the
general elections, current elect-
ed officials will eagerly await
the results that will determine
whether or not they get to keep
their seats on the Ann Arbor
City Council
If re-elected, the incumbents
_ say they are determined to con-

tinue addressing what they feel
are the key issues facing the
council today: balancing the
city's budget and redirecting
funds toward infrastructure and
public safety.
Council member Stephen
Rapundalo (D-Ward 2) said
maintaining the city's budget is
at the top of the council's to-do
list.
"I think first and foremost
the main issue is dealing with
the city's fiscal structure, the
budget and making sure that
we're within our means but at
the same time being able to plan
for needs that we have down the
road," Rapundalo said.
Council member Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1), who is an uncon-

tested candidate this year,
stressed the budget's impor-
tance since the amount of money
the city receives from the state
has decreased in recent years.
"It's goingto be another really
interesting year as we try to deal
with constant changes coming
from Lansing when it comes to
income for municipalities and
when it comes to knowing what
to do," Briere said.
The incumbents expressed
concern over prioritizing city
spending and determining
which sectors and projects the
budget should or shouldn't allo-
cate funds to. Council member
Stephen Kunselman (D-Ward
3) said he is frustrated with the

Challengers seek to
unseat Democrats

Candidates say
council needs to
readjust spending
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily Staff Reporter
Four candidates for Ann
Arbor City Council are aim-
ing to unseat four Democratic
incumbents in today's election.
In Wards 2, 3, 4 and 5, City
Council incumbents Mike
Anglin (D-Ward 5), Marcia
Higgins (D-Ward 4), Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3), Ste-
phen Rapundalo (D-Ward 2),
face opponents - three who
are Republican and one with
no party affiliation. City Coun-

cil member Sabra Briere (D-
Ward 1) is running unopposed.
Former Republican Council
member Jane Lumm is chal-
lenging Rapundalo and run-
ning as an independent. She
said she wasn't planning on
running in today's race, but
when both Democrats and
Republicans asked her to run,
she reconsidered.
Lumm said she hopes resi-
dents will be inspired to run in
future elections by seeing her
run without a party affiliation.
She added that one day, she'd
like to see Ann Arbor have non-
partisan elections.
"Ann Arbor has always been
described as an outlier when
it comes to partisan municipal
elections," Lumm said, adding

that most municipalities hold
non-partisan elections. She
explained that she is running
as an independent because she
describes herself as "socially
liberal" and "fiscally conserva-
tive."
Republican David .Parker, a
public accountant and financial
planner, is challenging Kunsel-
man for his Ward 3 seat on the
council. In an interview at the
Oct. 5 League of Women Vot-
ers debate, Parker said though
he is running as a Republican,
he describes himself as a Lib-
ertarian. He added that unlike
many of his Republican coun-
terparts, he supports the full
legalization of marijuana.

Cityproposals to askvoters
about sidewalk, street repair

Third proposal
regards Employees'
Retirement Board
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily Staff Reporter
Voters headed to the polls
today will be asked to take a
stance on three citywide pro-

posals dealing with funding for
street and sidewalk repairs and
appointments to the city's retire-
ment policy board.
Proposal 1: Street and Bridge
Millage
Proposal 1 would replace a
current tax that funds street
reconstruction between the
years of 2012 and 2016. The pro-
posal would raise an estimated
$9,091,000 in the first year after

its implementation.
While federal and state funds
are used to repair potholes with-
in the city, the proposed millage
would be used for resurfacing or
reconstruction of roads that need
repair and would replace Ann
Arbor's millage that expires this
year.

Baits I to close after winter 2012

With closure, 'U'
avoids $6 million
repairs for boilers
and fire system
By HALEY GOLDBERG
Daily StaffReporter
For the 571 students currently
* living in Baits I Residence Hall,
their year in the North Campus
housing complex may mark the
end of the Baits I legacy.
This past week, University
Housing informed residents and
staff in Baits I of the University's
intention to close the complex
at the end of this academic year,
according to University Housing
spokesman Peter Logan.
The decision was made after
the University determined that
replacing boilers in the building
and installing a fire suppression
system for the complex to meet
University standards would cost
an estimated $6 million, accord-
ing to Logan. He said the boilers
cannot be used safely for anoth-
er school year.

UNIVERSITY FACULTY
SACUA discusses affect
of sexual assault policy
on investigation of cases

Former SACUA
chair: 2 of 41 sexual
assault cases
investigated last yr.
By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily Staff Reporter
With only two of 41 reported
sexual assault cases inspected
at the University last year, and
under the pressure of federal
guidelines, the leading faculty
governance body is debating the
issue of investigation in sexual
assault cases.
In a meeting with the Senate
Advisory Committee of Uni-
versity Affairs yesterday, David
Potter, chair of the Student
Relations Advisory Commit-
tee and former chair of SACUA,
discussed how policies out-
lined in a letter sent by the U.S.
Department of Education to col-

leges will affect the treatment
of sexual assault allegations for
undergraduate students at the
University. The letter proposes
that each sexual assault case be
investigated and also calls for
the standard of evidence to be
lowered in the investigation.
In the "Dear Colleague" letter
sent in April, the Department of
Education setguidelines forhow
federally funded universities
can be in compliance with the
Title IX, which prohibits dis-
crimination based on sex in aca-
demic institutions. In response,
the University's Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Cen-
ter and other offices drafted an
interim policy for the University
and plan to implement a long-
term procedure this winter.
An interim policy that lowers
the standard of evidence from
clear and convincing - in which
it is highly probable that an
assault occurred - to a prepon-

years, Baits I has not met the
expectation of students ... and
to really upgrade those facilities
would really require a lot more
than $6 million," Logan said.
"... It's really difficult right now
at this point to justify spending

a significant amount of student
dollars on infrastructure and
renovation for Baits I."
University Housing Direc-
tor Linda Newman said anoth-
er main reason for closing the
building is that Baits I - which

opened in the mid-1960s - does
not embody the principles of
University Housing's Residen-
tial Life Initiatives. The project
includes creating dynamic resi-
dential neighborhoods and com-,

Touch football gains

70 years ago this week (Nov.
7, 1941): Approximately 40 teams
joined a touch football competi-
tion on campus, illustrating the
popularity of the sport at the Uni-
versity.
Almost everyday at 4 p.m., fra-
ternity brothers tossed or kicked
the pigskin in front of their houses.
The sport was popular because
everyone could play since touch
football wasn't as violent as its
tackle counterpart.
"It isn't necessary to be a walk-
ing muscle to play in the game, nor
does one have to coyly tip the scales
at 200 (pounds) ... small and frail or
lean and lanky have just as much
chance to be star material as any-
one else," a Nov. 7, 1941 Michigan
Daily article states.

50 years ago this week (Nov. 10,
1961): An East Quadrangle Residence
Hall student was greeted by two
scaly roommates when he received
a shipment of two boa constrictors.
The boa constrictors came from
British Honduras "just for a visit"
and were flown to Louis R. Jacoby, a
1962 University alum and president
of the Greene House at the time. The
dormitory was expecting the snakes
and made special accommodations
to house the snakes for the night.
At the time, Jacoby would not com-
ment on who sent the snakes. After
the snakes' brief visit, Jacoby said he
planned to sell the pair to a zoo.
20 years ago this week (Nov. 7,
1991): Terri Taliaferro, a second-year
journalism masters student, got the
job of sideline reporter for ESPN

popularity on campus
during the Michigan vs. Purdue
football game.
Taliaferro was chosen from a pool
of about 25 interested University .c
students to work as a broadcastert
for the game. During the broadcast,
she discussed the field conditions
at Michigan Stadium, the different
types of footballs used in the game
and the planes that flew advertise-
ments above the stadium.
"It was the most exciting, exhila-
rating, spontaneous experience
of my life and one that I'd like to
repeat," Taliaferro told the Daily at
the time. "I know ESPN was pleased
because they said they were. I don't
know what it will turn into buthope-
fully something great."

Republican presidential candidate former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney talks with Janet Buss, of Dubuque, Iowa, dur-
ing a campaign stop at Giese Manufacturing in Dubuque, Iowa yesterday.
Romney attempts to garner
support in Iowa campaign

Republican candidate
avoids talking about
opponent Cain
DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) - Try-
ing to stay above his party's fray,
Republican presidential candi-
date Mitt Romney focused yes-
terday on shoring up support
in this early-voting state and
presenting himself as the GOP's
most electable alternative to
President Barack Obama.
The former Massachusetts
governor stressed his recent fis-
cal proposals and business cre-
dentials at stops in eastern Iowa's
Dubuque and Scott counties,
where he won during his cam-
paign for the Republican nomi-
nation four years ago.
Romney said nothing about
the latest allegations of inappro-
priate sexual behavior against
fellow national GOP poll leader
Herman Cain. Instead, Rom-
ney stuck to the script during a
15-minute speech stressing his
private-sector background and
proposal to trim federal spend-
ing.
He tried to remind voters with
his words and campaign sched-
ule that he is running as much
against the Democratic incum-

bent as he is trying to distinguish
himself from his GOP rivals.
"I believe that one of the rea-
sons we've had such a hard time
getting our economy going again
is because of the huge deficits
being racked up by this president,
and by politicians in Washing-
ton," Romney told about 100 GOP
activists at a Dubuque sheet-met-
al products manufacturer.
He said nothing about Cain or
any of his rivals for the nomina-
tion.
His only mention of the nomi-
nating campaign came in- an
oblique reference to Iowa's leadoff
nominating caucuses, for which
Romney has campaigned lightly
but quietly hasbegun paying more
attention to in recent weeks.
"You guys were helpful for me
last time around, and I expect
you'llbe helpful for me this time,"
he said. "I'm planning on it."
Romney has sought to more
tightly control the message com-
ing from his campaign than he
did four years ago.
In Dubuque, he tested an
update of his standard campaign
speech, incorporating the new
fiscal policy he proposed last
week. In it, Romney pledges to
cut $500 billion from the fed-
eral deficit in his first four years
in office. "I will slay the deficit

beast," he said.
He shook handswith members
of the audience but answered no
questions from them or the corps
of local and national reporters
tailing him.
Monday's visit was Romney's
fourth to Iowa this year and it
came 18 days after his last trip,
a stark shift from his aggressive,
$10 million campaign for the
2008 caucuses that ended in a
disappointing second-place fin-
ish.
Aides have sought to mini-
mize expectations this time
around while quietly staying in
close touch with Romney's 2008
campaign supporters in hopes of
a surprise Iowa finish heading
into the New Hampshire prima-
ry, where expectations for him
remained high.
Romney recently said he
would like to win Iowa. He has
promised a more aggressive
travel schedule in the final seven
weeks and plans more than one
telephone event where he talks
to thousands of Iowans and
answersquestions.
Romney has polled at or near
the top of surveys of likely GOP
caucusgoers since entering the
race in June, while GOP rivals
Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry
and Cain have ignited curios-

Michigan Democrats are
detailing a legislative proposal
that would provide a tax credit to
small businesses that hire unem-

The legislation was expected to
be discussed yesterday at an event
at the University of Michigan-
Flint campus.
The bill would allow a tax cred-
it of $4,000 or 25 percent of the

whichever amount is less.

Penn State sex
scandal angers
Sec. o ducation
Education Secretary Arne
Duncan said allegations of sex-
ual abuse involving Penn State
University are heartbreaking
and make him "extraordinarily
angry."
If the allegations are proven
true, it's "mind boggling" that
it was allowed to go on for so
long, Duncan told The Associ-
ated Press in an interview yes-
terday. He said educators have an
"absolute moral, ethical and legal
responsibility" to protect kids.
"If a blind eye was turned
towards it, or if the allegations
were somewhat buried or not
taken seriously, well, you're actu-
ally perpetuating the problem,"
Duncan said. "You're giving the
abuser more opportunities to
hurt more kids. I just can't fathom

that."
Duncan said the Education
Department has been working
on efforts to prevent sexual vio-
lence on college campuses, but it's
too early to know if it would be
involved at Penn State in any way.

Obama said yesterday night he
would put his legislative record
"up against any president in their

ing Washington's culture, he says
"the fever has not broken yet."
Obama was speaking at the

plexes within five minutes of a
residential dining hall.
"As we continue to work
through evaluating where all
the buildings work within (the
Residential Life Initiatives) ...
and making decisions and prior-
ities about where to spend lim-
ited renovation dollars, we came
to the conclusion ... that Baits I
is not a building that we want to
continue to invest money into,"
Newman said.
The decision comes after
months of analysis by University
Housing and discussions with
the leadership of the Universi-
ty's Division of Student Affairs,
Logan said. Once Baits I closes
this spring, further building
assessments will be conducted
before the University makes a
final decision on what to do with
the vacant building, according to
Logan.
"If after assessing the situa-
tion we determine that having
Baits I is extremely necessary,
then I'm sure we'll see what it
would cost to make that hap-
pen," Logan said. "... We need to
do more assessment of what it
would require to not only bring
it up to a level of infrastruc-
ture reliability, but then going
beyond and making it a useful
community."
While the specific logistics of
closing BaitsI are yet to be deter-
mined, Logan said he wanted to
inform students of the intention
to close the complex before they
begin thinking about the hous-
ing sign-up process in January.
"We've got to have our ducks
in a row prior to that sign-up
process, but at least we need to
now make the students aware
that Baits I is not a residential
opportunity this coming year,"
Logan said.
The closing of Baits I means
two residence halls will be
closed next year, as East Quad-
rangle Residence Hall will be
shuttered due to yearlong reno-
vations. Currently, 1,433 stu-
dents, faculty and staff reside
in these two residence hail
combined. The reopening of
Alice Lloyd Residence Hall next

year, which is currently closed
for renovations, will add living
spaces for only 530 students.
To compensate for this loss
of housing capacity, New-
man said University Housing
will increase the presence of
undergraduates in Northwood
Apartments I and II - where
mostly graduate students cur-
rently reside - and will expand
the Northwood Houses first-
year experience further into
Northwood III.
"When we created the North-
wood Houses, we increased the
number of occupants per apart-
ment," Newman said. "So we'll
do the same as we expand more
first-year housing into the other
buildings of Northwood III."
Newman added that approxi-
mately the same number of
undergraduates will be able
to live on North Campus even
with the closing of Baits I. And
the University will maintain its
guarantee of offering on-cam-
pus housing to all first-year stu-
dents who apply by the deadline.
"Without a shadow of a doubt,
it is a priority of the University
of Michigan to be able to pro-
vide housing for all first-year
students, and we are planning to
have housing for the admissions
target of approximately 6,000,"
Newman said.
Returning students, however,
are not guaranteed on-campus
housing, and Logan said Univer-
sity Housing is working closely
with the Residence Halls Asso-
ciation and ResStaff to figure
out the best way to prioritize the
room selection process for stu-
dents returning to the residence
halls.
For student and professional
faculty and staff working in
Baits I, Newman said they will
be relocated to new residence
halls next year, and no jobs will
be lost due to the complex's clo-
sure. The housing experience of
current Baits I residents will not
be impacted in any way due to
the decision to close next year,
she added.
A community gathering in
the residence hall's Eaton Upper
Lounge was held last night for
the residents of Baits I to discuss
the decision to close the build-
ing next year. Patricia Griffin,

director of Residence Educa-
tion, spoke to an audience of 16
students, including residents
and resident advisers, about the
closing of the complex.
At the discussion, Griffin
addressed students' concerns
and confusion regarding the
Baits I closing. She encouraged
direct communication between
the students and University
Housing staff about the issue.
Though many questions proved
unanswerable at this time - like
what will happen to the building
after it's vacated - Griffin said
getting students to talk about
the issue was the main point of
the gathering.
"I think at this point, what
we really want to do is get stu-
dents thinking," Griffin said. "I
really want to hear their con-
cerns ... and there will come a
time before too long where we'll
have a plan, but I think what we
didn't want to do is craft one
without any student voice."
Griffin told the audience
she anticipates less residential
housing space to be available
to returning students next year
and explained that RHA will
work with University Housing
to develop a sign-up process that
addresses the issue.
Engineering sophomore Ryan
Landay, who lives in Baits I and
attended last night's gather-
ing, said Griffin's prediction of
decreasing housing space has
already affected his decision
where to live next year.
"I'mtryingtofigure outwhere
I'm going to live next year, and I
was trying to get an apartment,
and I don't know if I want to go
through the trouble of finding
an apartment, but apparently it's
goingto be harder to find a dorm
next year," Landay said.
However, Landay said he
agrees with the University's
decision to close Baits I and also
thinks $6 million is too large a
figure to renovate the building.
Griffin also discussed a
potential celebration of Baits I
to precede the closing of the res-
idence hall. The residents at the
gathering agreed to organize a
communal forum in the coming
weeks to generate ideas on how
to commemorate the legacy of
Baits I.

CHALLENGERS
From Page 1
Higgins, who faces attorney
Eric Scheie (R). Scheie said Ann
Arbor's priorities are out of
order, as the city has cut back
too heavily on funds for public
safety and infrastructure. He
described the new City Hall
and $750,000 public art piece
in front of the building as exam-
ples of exorbitant and unneces-
sary spending.
"We need to focus on basic
city services the way the city
once did," Scheie said.
'Scheie also pointed out that
his opponent has not attended
several key city events, includ-
ing the League of Women Voters
debate.
Republican Stuart Berry, who
is running against Anglin for
the Ward 5 seat, said the current
City Council appears to be a very
"monolithic" body. He also said
the council is too often looking
at how to raise and spend more
money.
"The City Council appears to
be not as aware as they should
be that we're in a great economic
downturn, and they need to cut
back spending so that taxes can
be lowered and people can save
their houses," Berry said.
On the ballot today is the
annual street millage to raise
money for street improve-
ments as well as a sidewalk
millage, which would transfer
the responsibility of improv-
ing sidewalks from individual
residents to the city. Lumm said
she would support the street
millage, despite the fact that
some residents are concerned
its funds could be used to pay
for public art projects. She said
if not for this concern, a street
millage would normally receive
widespread support.
However, Lumm does not
support the sidewalk millage
because she is concerned that
residents who have already
repaired their sidewalks will
be forced to pay for sidewalk
improvements of other residents.
Scheie said he is concerned
that if passed, sidewalk and
street millage funds won't be
used properly.
"I don't think it's going to get
done," Scheie said. "I think it's
just another way of passing the
buck."
At the League of Women Vot-
ers debate, Parker said he would
support the proposed street mill-
age, but would-not support the
sidewalk millage.
Berry said he doesn't under-
stand why street improvement
cannot be funded by the city's
general fund instead of taxpay-
ers' money. However, he said he
supports the street millage.
"I think it's out of balance, but
I reluctantly vote for the street
millage because that is one of the
basic, core functions of a govern-

derance of evidence - in which
it is more likely than not that an
assault occurred - was instated

at the University in August.
Only two of the 41 cases of
sexual' ssault reported at the
University last y ear were inves-
tigated. This means that on
average, only one in 20 reported
assaults on campus are investi-
gated, according to Potter. Inves-
tigating sexual assaults can be
helpful to pick up on trends in
assaults, he said.
"If you don't investigate where
the assault took place, you don't
have a record," Potter said. "You
simply have no way of knowing
that pattern is there."
However, Pottersaid he
believes survivors have valid
personal reasons for not wanting
their cases investigated, such as
maintainingtheir privacy or pre-
venting their parents from find-
ing out.
In an interview after the
meeting, SACUA Vice Chair
Kim Kearfott, a professor in the
Medical School and College of
Engineering, said it has typical-
ly been the survivor's choice to
forego an investigation for sex-
ual assault. But, investigations
would be helpful for the student
body, she said.
"I think it's. a good thing to
look at more data and make sure

ment," Berry said.
Berry said it is unfortunate
that residents have been forced
to pay for their own sidewalks
to be repaired, but he said he
believes the sidewalk improve-
ment also reflects a basic munici-
pal service.
The proposed Fuller Road
Station and mass transit options
in the city are important issues
in the election. Scheie called
the Fuller Road Station project
a "fiasco" and alleged that it is
in violation of the Ann Arbor
city charter because it builds on
parklands without a voter refer-
endum.
"The City Council just acts
like the parkland is there to do
what they want," Scheie said.
He also said he's not sure if
constructing the train station
is warranted because there may
not be a demand for rail.
"They're acting as if, well,
we'll just put this station in here,
and then the rail will come, and
it will all just happen magically,"
Scheie said. "That's crazy."
Despite studies that show
the city needs a more advanced
transit system, Parker said he is
against any form of public transit
beyond regular buses. He added
that voters should decide wheth-
er the city should implement
advanced transit in the future.
Berry, like many other candi-
dates, said he is concerned the
Fuller Road station is being built
over parklands. Additionally, he
doesn't believe a second train
station in Ann Arbor is warrant-
ed, considering there is already
an Amtrak station on Depot
Street, which is less than a mile
away from the proposed Fuller
Road site. Berry said though Ann
Arbor needs to improve its traffic
flow, advanced transit is not the
answer.
All four challengers said they
would like to see more student
involvement in city affairs.
Though Lumm believes she
can serve students effectively,
she said students are most likely
not paying attention to this par-
ticular election.
"These aren't the issues, I
think, that students tend to real-
ly track," Lumm said.
However, she added that she
is particularly concerned with
public safety, which students are
also worried about. Streetlights
are a "basic need" that can help
help prevent crime, Lumm said.
The restoration and addition of
lights should come before other
discretionary forms of spending
like advanced transit, she said.
To better serve the needs of
students, Scheie - whose wife is
a Ph.D. candidate at the Univer-
sity - said he would like to see
a student serve on the council,
even if that means altering the
city charter.
"I am very sensitive to the
needs of students, and I don't
think they're being met," Scheie
said.
there aren't repeat situations
going on, say at a particular fra-
ternity or under particular cir-
cumstances that our students
are at risk for sexual assaults,"
Kearfott said.
Potter said lowering the stan-

dard of evidence would result in
more convictions for students
accused of sexual assault.
"The alternative is a clear and
convincing standard which is a
51 percent certainty, as opposed
to 80 percent certainty," Potter
said.
Potter also spoke aboutthe fac-
ulty governing body's selecting
candidates to fill positions on an
appeals board. The board would
consist of a student appointed
by the Michigan Student Assem-
bly, a faculty member appointed
by the Senate Assembly and an
administrator appointed by Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man. The board would handle
appeals from convicted students
and sexual assault survivors.
Potter stressed the importance
of choosing board members who
have experience dealing with
similar student grievances since
the issues they deal with are par-
ticularly sensitive.
"I think it requires that people
know what they're doing," Potter
said. "The worst thing you could
have in one of these situations
is people who don't have expe-
rience in listening and hearing
grievances and dealing with the
process."


BUDGET
From Page 1
city'sdecisionto spendmoneyon
downtown development projects
and public art while simultane-
ously limiting funds to public
safety.
"We've been spending more
in directing staff to be more
focused on downtown megaproj-
ects and economic development
than focusing on our infrastruc-
ture, our roads, our bridges, our
police and fire forces," Kunsel-
man said. "There is a concern
among the elected that we've
lost sight of our purpose."
The city's 2012 fiscal yearr
included a cut of 30 positions in
the Ann Arbor fire and police
departments. However, because
many of the positions were
already unoccupied, only six
officers were laid off.
Almost all the incumbents
said they will vote in favor of
the street and sidewalk mill-
age, which will increase taxes
to generate funding for updating
roads throughout the city. But
some expressed concern that
the money raised by the millage
would be used for initiatives like
public art, which many view as
an inappropriate use of funds.
"I think it's atrocious that the
city has hired a public art coor-
dinator out of the same funds
that provide for public safety
and utilities and infrastructure,"
Kunselman said.
A public art structure in front
of the Ann Arbor Municipal
Center was the source of con-
troversy last month because it
cost $750,000 to install. For the
city's 2012 fiscal year budget, the
council approved an ordinance
that allocated 1 percent more to
the city's Public Art fund.
Showing skepticism toward
projects like the Fuller Road Sta-
tion and Library Lot conference
center that have yet to show sub-
stantial progress, Kunselman
noted that the city has made
many empty promises.
"It's frustrating listening to
the rhetoric and knowing that

it's just not going to happen that
way," he said. "We need to be
more frank with the public, and
that's how Iam asa politician."
Council member Mike Anglin
(D-Ward 5) and Marcia Higgins
(D-Ward 4) said the city should
focus on funding budget items
that address public needs, citing
mainly infrastructure and public
safety.
Regarding the University,
Anglin noted that student safety
is a major concern on his agen-
da. He said he would like to see
council make progress on the
issue and and would like to pro-
pose an ordinance that would
require porch lights to be left
on to prQyide =ogg light for stu-
dents walking at night.
Anglin added that he wants to
start a discussion with Universi-
ty students and work with them
to increase lighting in off-cam-
pus residential neighborhoods.
He noted that more dialogue is
needed between the council and
representatives from the Michi-
gan Student Assembly. This
semester, MSA's Student Safety
Commission, in conjunction
with the University's Division of
Student Affairs, created Beyond
the Diag - a program that aims
to make off-campus areas safer.
Rapundalo, who originally
proposed the establishment of
the Michigan Student Assembly
& Ann Arbor City Council Liai-
son Committee in 2005, said the
committee has been inactive for
the past few years. However,
the committee has the poten-
tial to increase communication
between the two entities and
work on city issues that affect
students, he said.
"Certainly the opportunity
- the mechanism - exists," he
said. "It really needs to be revi-
talized."
At the polls today, city resi-
dents must choose between
a Republican or Democratic
candidate for three of the four
wards that have contested can-
didates.
Higgins said she doesn't think
the issue of party membership
will decide the elections, despite

the fact that Ann Arbor's elected
officials has been overwhelm-
ingly Democratic for the past
few years.
"I look at it (as) less of a
Republican-Democrat casting,"
Higgins said. "I think voters are
smarter than that. I think they
really do look at what you've
done and what you say you're
goingto do."
When asked what distin-
guishes her from her Republican
opponent Eric Scheie, Higgins
responded that her persistence
in making sure that fundinggoes
to projects and services essential
to the basic operation of the city
sets her apart. She pointed to her
support of the city spending mil-
lions of dollars to upgrade water
and sewage treatment plants
that have been neglected by
other councils since their instal-
lation in the 1930s.
Anglin, who is running
against Republican candidate
Stuart Berry, said he noted some
key similarities and differences
between him and his challeng-
er during last month's debate.
between incumbents and chal-
lengers.
"What we have in common
(is) fiscal responsibility - spend
what is needed, but don't over-
spend," Anglin said. "The only
difference I saw between us as
we talked was maybe that I'm
more inclined towards trying
to help those at the low end of
things, meaning the homeless
people, people who - through
no fault of their own - just don't
have the life that many of us do
have."
Anglin added that he is dis-
appointed in recent cuts to
community services that help
disadvantaged people.
Facing tonight's results with
no expectations, Rapundalo said
he takes his challengers seri-
ously, and he feels the same way
he did six years ago when he ran
against a tough Republican can-
didate.
"The voters will decide, and
it will be what it will be and on
Wednesday morning, life goes
on."

T oday is Election Day. Though it isn't a presidential, guberna-
torial or a mayoral election, it's still important for students to
vote. Today's election for Ann Arbor City Council members is
contested in four of the city's five wards. Though most students don't
directly interact with City Council members, the members make deci-
sions that can impact students' lives. Council members enact ordi-
nances for Ann Arbor, address lighting issues in off-campus areas and
control funding for public safety. It is essential that all students go to
the polls today and cast their votes.

A failing grade for Cantor

magine that you're writing a
paper for a class - any class
at all. You're confident in your
mastery of the
course mate-
rial, and you
easily produce
a well-written
essay. But when
your professor
returns your "
paper one week
later marked DANIEL
with an F grade CHARDELL.
and a "see me"
scribbled below
it, you're bewildered. At office hours
you ask why you've done so poorly.
Your professor tells you that your
arguments were strong and your
thinking impressed her, but you
cited no evidence to support any of
your claims. Therefore, she couldn't
give you anythingbut afailinggrade.
Needless to say, that rarely (if
ever) happens at the University.
Heck, that wouldn't even happen
at most high schools. As students,
we re aware that an argument car-
ries no weight unless backed with
solid evidence. This goes for any
subject. In the face of evidence to
the contrary, or in the absence of any
evidence at all, outlandish claims
don't hold up.
Academic discourse doesn't
exist without evidence. That much
should be common sense. So why
did some on campus suddenly for-
get this basic tenet of academia the
moment Republican House Major-
ity Leader Eric Cantor came to Ann
Arbor last week?-
Case in point: a Michigan Daily
viewpoint titled Good work, Mr.
Leader written on behalf of the Col-
lege Republicans. Published on the
day of the House Majority Leader's
visit, the piece praises Cantor in a
spate of buzzword glorification a la
Fox News that would bring a patri-
otic tear to any Tea Partier's eye.
According to the viewpoint, Can-
tor has been busy this term "roll-
ing back job-killing regulations,"

"fighting tooth and nail to prevent
implementation of President Barack
Obama's unconstitutional health
care law" and making efforts "to
engage in dialogue, reach across the
aisle and find common sense, agree-
able solutions to our economic prob-
lems." After all, it's obvious that "the
only job Obama cares about saving is
his own," right? The term "job-kill-
ing" appears three times throughout
the viewpoint. What a rich adjective.
In their analysis, the College
Republicans cite no academic or pro-
fessional studies, no data, no polls,
no history, no specifies - nothing
even slightly resembling factual
evidence that might support their
broad, bold claims. I realize we're
working with limited space here
(around 750 words), but any scrap of
objective information would really
help me out. At the very least, men-
tion a credible report that we can
access on our own time. Buzzwords
like "job-killing" are sexy, but hol-
low. They get you great ratings on
cable news, but they accomplish
nothing in the real.world.
And then there was Cantor's
speech.
Before I go any further, let me
first say that I didn't appreciate the
protesters who, during the ques-
tion-and-answer session, thought it
useful to stand up and shout down
Cantor whenever they disliked
his answers. Yes, I .realize Cantor
evaded nearly every question he was
fielded. And yes, I realize how frus-
trating it was to watch. But making a
spectacle, no matter how well inten-
tioned, only undermines the integ-
rity of your cause.
To tell you the truth, Cantor's
speech was pretty boring. The only
part of his talk that I enjoyed, and
the only part with any real sub-
stance, was the bit about his family
history. Fleeing religious persecu-
tion during the turn of the century
in Eastern Europe, Cantor's grand-
mother immigrated to the United
States with nothing but the prom-
ise of the fabled American dream. I

found it touching - perhaps because
it was the first time I'd ever seen
Cantor appear remotely human.
In his speech, Cantor frequently
argued that government should give
struggling Americans a "hand up,"
not a "hand out." He never speci-
fied what exactly distinguishes one
from the other, but given his hostil-
ity toward Occupy Wall Street, I'd
assume hand ups don't include any
tax hikes for the wealthy. Cantor also
spoke about giving all Americans the
opportunity to "climb the ladder" of
success. "We should want all people
to move up and no one to be pulled
down," he said. That sounds nice,
right? His rhetoric was so devoid of
substance that I couldn't really agree
or disagree with any of it. His words
were just there, lifeless.
Leader's speech
was nothing but
empty rhetoric.

Students make up a large portion of the
Ann Arbor population, but historically don't.
turn up on Election Day. If students don't vote
and put the best representatives into office,
there is no guarantee that City Council mem-
bers will be invested in the needs of students.
In the Ward 2 race, incumbent Stephen
Rapundalo (D-Ward 2) is facing Independent
Jane Lumm. Rapundalo has an understand-
ing of the financial challenges Ann Arbor is
facing: He told The Michigan Daily he has a
strong desire to work on labor negotiations
and ensure laborers have fair benefits.
While Rapundalo would like to work on
important issues, Lumm appears to better
understand the needs of the city and stu-
dents. Her first priority is public safety. She
told the Daily she would like to reallocate
funds from the city budget for the police and
fire departments and would like to increase
lighting on Oxford Road. Luomm also had
some great ideas for better comunication
between council members and engaging
more residents in city budget discussions.
Because of bcr- committsr lto safety and
inclusion, the Daily endorses JANE LUMM
for City Council, Ward 2.
In the Ward 3 race, incumbent Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) is running against
Republican David Parker. Parker was
unavailable to meet with the Daily's editorial
board to discuss his plans for City Council.
Kunselman has a solid platform that
focuses on public health, safety and welfare.
He told the Daily that too much funding has
been cut from fire and police departments.
His objective to redistribute money to allow
more funding to be put toward safety is ideal.
Kunselman is also a strong proponent for
density downtown. He is a supporter of his-
toric preservation and wants to fight for citi-
zen concerns in neighborhoods. Kunselman
has the experience and the priorities tq push
ordinances that will benefit students and
Ann Arbor. The Daily endorses STEPHEN

KUNSELMAN for City Council, Ward 3.
The Ward 4 race pits incumbent Mar-
cia Higgins (D-Ward 4) against Republican
challenger Eric Scheie. While Higgins has
the experience of having served many years
on the City Council, her apparent apathy
toward the election and her voting record are
troubling. Higgins voted against Ann Arbor's
medical marijuana ordinance in June. She
didn't attend the League of Women Voters
debate last month and was unavailable to
meet with the Daily's editorial board to dis-
cuss the election. It's unclear if Higgins is
truly dedicated to the position.
Though Scheie is a Republican in the
typically liberal Ann Arbor government,
and therefore an unlikely contender, he
seems intent on combating complacency in
Ann Arbor government. He is dedicated to
revamping projects like the Georgetown
Mall a "brown field" on Packard Street
that has been polluting Ann Arbor for more
than a year - and freeing up money to deal
with cuts to the fire and police department
budgets. He also wants to increase benefits
for unions.
Higgins has experience, but that experi-
ence has seemed to make her complacent
in her position. Scheie has the potential to
bring a new perspective and attitude toward
city government. The Daily endorses ERIC
SCHEIE for City Council, Ward 4.
Both incumbent Mike Anglin (D-Ward
5) and challenger Republican Stuart Berry
were unable to meet with the Daily's edito-
rial board. However, Anglin spoke with the
Daily during the primaries in August and
talked about his desire to create more open-
ness within City Council. He wants to create
a committee that would include more public
opinion in council meetings and find ways to
incorporate more student issues into discus-
sions. Because of his commitment to trans-
parency, the Daily endorses MIKE ANGLIN
for City Council, Ward 5.

In reality, the House Majority
Leader promotes draconian policies
that run counter to the American
dream - a fairytale that is dying,
if not already dead. In a landmark
study last month, the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office found
that, between 1979 and 2007, income
grew by 275 percent for the top 1 per-
cent of households,65 percent for the
next 19 percent, about 40 percent for .
the next 60 percent, and 18 percent
for the bottom 20 percent. Accord-
ing to the CIA World Factbook, the
United States has more unequal
income distribution than countries
such as Iran, China, Egypt and Tuni-
sia. How would Cantor remedy these
issues? I have no idea. His speech
never really addressed them.

'Live' school settings are important

JESSE KLEIN
Workshop in need of a remix

Everyone has had to go to many boring,
supposedly helpful, seminars or workshops.
I thought that once I graduated from high
school I would be free of infuriating work-
shops that were not only underprepared but
also useless. I thought going to college meant
that I would find myself in the "harsh real
world" my teachers always warned me about.
Instead of being treated like the adult I now
officially am, I feel like a middle school stu-
dent. The University seems to assume I have
no knowledge as to how the world works.
I knew that as a freshman the Univer-
sity would try to ease my transition into my
new life. College is an extreme adjustment,
and I don't fault the University for trying to
educate me about new experiences and situ-
ations I could be exposed to. While I hated
taking the alcohol education lesson online,
and while the acting in the freshman orien-
tation show was terrible, it was at least well
executed and did give me a few bits of infor-
mation I did not already know. This cannot be
said about the Relationship Remix workshop
- a new workshop implemented by SAPAC to
discuss sexual consent - I was required to
attend as a freshman.
This workshop was not interesting, useful,
funny or engaging. The leaders of the work-
shop read off pieces of paper. The questions
were obvious and basic about relationships -
things that anyone smart enough to get into
the University would already know. The lead-
ers proposed questions like "What is consent?"
and "How could you keep a friend from being
pressured to have sex?" After the leaders read
these questions word for word, they looked for

raised hands, but because no one in the group
of 50 bored freshmen was Hermione Granger,
hands remained at people's sides. After a min-
ute of silence one of two things would happen:
One nice freshman, who could not stand the
silence, usually me, would give the obvious
answer, or one of the leaders would read their
response off the papers.
Worse than that is the role-playing we were
forced to do with complete strangers. We had
to practice asking for consent, saying no and
graciously accepting it. When we were given
the three situations, most people took it as a
joke or did not do the activity at all. And who
can blame them? Sitting in a lounge pretending
to hit on a complete stranger is not onlyuncom-
fortable, but unrealistic and purposeless.
Most high school students have had the
experiences of being pursued by an unwanted
pursuer, and most have learned to deal with it.
'They did not need a workshop then, and I am
sure they don't need one now. This workshop
also comes almost three months into school.
Three months of parties have surely taught
students how to give and receive rejections.
And I'm sure most students have had "rela-
tionships" before coming to college.
If the University is going to make these.
events mandatory it should at least put in the
time to make them something that could at
least be somewhat helpful. The University
prides itself on being leaders, and as freshmen
we have been told that we are now part of that
group, so why does it continue to treat us like
naive children?
Jesse Klein is an LSA freshman.

"Time to rock 'n' roll! Hurry up or you'll miss the
school bus!" my mother would say to wake me up for
school each morning during my middle school years.
This seemingly natural phrase, however, may soon be
replaced by mothers yelling at their 10-year-old sons and
daughters to "Hurry up and turn on the computer for
school." These words leave many of us puzzled.
Legislation that would allow for the expansion of
cyber schools in the state of Michigan recently passed
in the Republican-led State Senate last week. The bill
contributes to the state's ongoing effort to expand public
education options. Michigan state law currently allows
for the operation of two cyber charter schools, which
have a total combined enrollment of 1,400 students.
The new legislation would lift the cap on the number of
cyber charter schools permitted, thereby encouraging
this second-rate education service to replace traditional
school models.
Many feel that increasing cyber schooling is a wise
decision. There are currently long waitlists to enroll in
cyber charter schools, which indicates that parents are
seeking more opportunities for their children to engage
in this type of educational experience.
As the -digital age sweeps through society, many
believe that cyber school education would allow Michi-
gan to keep up with the latest technological trends.and
advances that are responsible for reshaping society and
education. Proponents of the bill believe families should
have more choices and opportunities for how and where
they choose to engage in the public educational system.
In their eyes, cyber schooling provides a less expensive
means for delivering education to children and simulta-
neously serves those opposed to the traditional school-
ing model.
I, however, always imagined motherhood consisting
of me walking my children to the bus stop on their-first
day of kindergarten, and I wouldn't want this notion to
be replaced by a mere physical object. Expanding cyber
schools in Michigan would cause more harm than good
for students.
Is Michigan really going to push education forward
in a positive matter with an attempt to conform to the
digital age? I think it's shameful that so many individuals
are in favor of replacing real "live" school settings with
online-only courses for adolescents who are just begin-
ning to understand and learn about the world in which
they live. The physical interactions that occur each day

among teachers and students are vital to a child's suc-
cessful academic achievement. These communication
opportunities provide students the chance to enhance
their social skills while being able to effectively learn
and promptly ask questions each step of the way.
Furthermore, cyber charter schools provide little
financial and academic accountability. There is limited
evidence of their effectiveness, especially since there
are limited formal rules and minimal supervision that
occurs with online schooling. Students who are unable
to grasp the information quickly are at a disadvantage
since they don't receive constant attention from a teach-
er and can't ask for immediate clarification. It's ques-
tionable to say how successful children will be in the
long run if their knowledge is based solely from online
education. There is also concern regarding the funding
of these new cyber charter schools. Surely, the Michigan
government will have to tap into citizens' tax money to
improve online education. That just seems wasteful and
unnecessary. I
While we are all in agreement that society is chang-
ing and evolving in the 20th century with technological
advances, children and their education should not be
used for experimental purposes. Education is too valu-
able and crucial for survival in this generation, and it
should not be designed with the intention of having it
become more efficient, cheap and quick.
Perhaps providing a mix of online only and physical
school attendance is one solution. Children will still
receive face-to-face communication with their teach-
ers and be able to socially interact with fellow class-
mates. In addition, children will have the ability to learn
certain material on the Internet. It's important to put
constraints on what type of information can be taught
online since certain subjects may be better.taught in a
classroom setting.
Children should not be subjected to spending all day
"learning" in front of a computer screen. It's neces-
sary for them to experience learning in the traditional
school model to enhance their intellectual and social
capabilities. While it's important to acknowledge the
power of digitization in the 21st century, we shouldn't
allow technology to undermine the traditional forms of
education that have proven so successful for our nation
thus far.

Hoke rehashes close call,
clock management at Iowa

'NASCAR' offense ignites
Wolverines down the stretch

By TIM ROHAN
Daily SportsEditor
Brady Hoke's mouth was half
agape as he talked to special
teams ace Floyd Simmons on the
sidelines. Hoke had just called
his first timeout of the second
half with 5:22 remaining in the
fourth quarter. But the 'oops'
look said he knew he made a
mistake.
It was a questionable decision
considering the circumstances:
Facing a 4th-and-6 near mid-
field, Iowa was ready to punt.
"Why call a timeout if you're
Michigan?" ESPN anchor Dave
Pasch asked rhetorically. "Don't
you need to save your timeouts?"
Hoke said he had counted 12
men on the field for Michigan.
To Hoke's credit, had the five-
yard penalty been called, Iowa
would've had a 4th-and-1 situa-
tion.
The Hawkeyes were initially
going to go for it, facing a 4th-
and-1, but they were called for
a false start and were forced to
punt. Worried about the penalty,
Hoke called timeout.
But, as Hoke realized after-
ward, there were only 11 Wolver-
ines on the field.
"I didn't count very well,"
Hoke said. "And as soon as I
called it and counted, I said,
'I hope we don't need that one
late.'"
Twenty minutes later, Hoke's
hands were tied because of it,
especially after Junior Heming-
way's would-be touchdown
catch was called incomplete
with seven seconds left.
On Monday, Hoke rehashed
many 'what-ifs' that weighed
heavily on Michigan's 24-16
loss at Iowa, mostly concerning
Hemingway, but also the time-
out blunder.
Hoke had used his second
timeout to stop the clock as
Michigan got the ball back on
its final drive. And he called his
third and final timeout, instead
of spiking the ball, when the
Wolverines got a first down .at
the three-yard line with 16 sec-
onds left.
Without any timeouts, Michi-
gan was forced to throw the ball
four times.
The luxury of the pass-run
option was not afforded the Wol-
verines and the dynamic quar-
terback Denard Robinson, who
could have been forced to watch
the clock tick away had a run not
been successful.
A team that ranked among the
nation's best at running the ball
had to throw it.
"No (regrets)," Hoke said of
his timeout usage down the
stretch. "We talked about that
(Sunday). Going into the two-
minute at the end, knowing
where we were timeout-wise,
I thought (offensive coordina-
tor) Al (Borges) really managed
it well. We had four shots at the
endzone. Two of them we had in
our hands."

you might

was Tony Stewart's upset vic-

on Sunday.
Instead, Hoke was discuss-
ing the "NASCAR" formation
that almost saved the No. 22
Michigan football team from
its 24-16 upset defeat in Iowa
City on Saturday.
After redshirt sophomore
running back Fitzgerald Tous-
saint - the Wolverines' lead-
ing rusher against Iowa - left
the game with an injury, junior
quarterback Denard Robinson
and the Michigan offense shift-
ed into the one-back, three-
receiver shotgun set and turned
up the pace.
Was it essentially a two-min-
ute drill?
"It's just a little different on
the play selection - the calls,"
Hoke said on Monday.
Is it as fast as the two-minute
offense?
"It might be even a little more
tempo," Hoke said.
Robinson appeared signifi-
cantly more comfortable in the
"NASCAR," a formation that is
more similar to what Michigan
ran the past three seasons.
In the final quarter, Robin-
son led the offense on one late
scoring drive and fell just three
yards and a two-point conver-
sion short of completing the
comeback against the Hawk-
eyes.
"I think when you go what we
call 'NASCAR' ... you limit the
defense a little bit," Hoke said.

Fifth-year senior Junior Hemingway was still the center of attention Monday.

Hoke was still convinced
Monday that Hemingway caught
it.
"I thought Junior made a
catch," Hoke said.
In bounds?
"Oh yeah."
Did he finish the process of
catching the ball?
"You see, that's where every-
thing gets diluted," Hoke
responded. "What is that rule?"
How do you perceive it?
"I thought he caught the ball."
And he finished the catch and
everything?
"Hm-hm," he affirmed.
Redshirt sophomore running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint said
every player thought Heming-
way had caught it when they
reviewed the game film on Sun-
day.
When the play happened live,
the officials immediately ruled
it incomplete, but then it was
reviewed in the booth. After the
review, the official was ambigu-
ous: "The ruling on the field
stands as called. The pass is
incomplete. Third down."
That was it.
On the telecast, Pasch
explained that the explanation
meant they did not have enough
video evidence to overturn the
ruling on the field.'
Hoke was never given an

explanation during the game
or at any point afterwards. He
added that they didn't have time
during the game to explain why
or how they ruled Hemingway's
catch incomplete.
Like he does every week with
a handful of plays, Hoke will ask
the Big Ten office about the rul-
ing on Hemingway's would-be
catch.
"I think it's just the way it
goes," Hoke said. "Just part of
the game. We're always trying to
get, 'Is that the right call? Why
did they call it?' More than any-
thing."
Senior leaders Ryan Van
Bergen and Dave Molk both
expressed some level of disdain
for the call, but both were stoic
in their approach to move for-
ward - atrait that Hoke has val-
ued win or lose.
"I think the honest approach
we take every Sunday with our
kids - good or bad - (will help),"
Hoke said. "We'll move through
that and past it pretty quick.
They know.
"(Monday), there will be a
bunch of them over in the office
watching film on Illinois. They'll
turn the page pretty quickly.
Kids are a heck of a lot more
resilient than we are. We've got
to take that next step and so do
they."

Junior running back Vincent Smith is a key part of the 'NASCAR" offensive scheme Michigan runs to speed op tempo.

Faceoffs more than just about the draw for Berenson, Michigan

Michigan won just
43 percent of its
faceoffs against
Western Michigan
By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
In football, the Oklahoma drill
is a staple at practices from high
school to the pros.
Created by famed Sooners
coach Bud Wilkinson, the drill
pits two players against each
other in a hard-hitting, teeth-
gritting tackling situation.
Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson may soon need to
integrate a similar tool into his
practices. But instead of having
his players try knocking their
opponent to the turf - or in this
case, the ice - he'd make them
beat the other to the puck off the
draw.
The Wolverines are plenty

physical - a powerful check
from senior defenseman Greg
Pateryn may land an inattentive
opponent in Ypsilanti. Rather, a
fundamental weakness exposed
itself against Western Michigan
this weekend.
"I think up until this weekend,
we've been strong on faceoffs,"
Berenson said.
He added that faceoffs are
about the team, not just the man
in the middle.
Despite winning a majority
of this season's faceoffs thus far,
there's still cause for concern
inside the circles.
And it's not simply that Michi-
gan hasn't been taking control of
the puck - it won just 43 percent
of the time against the Broncos -
it's when the Wolverines lose it.
"A big part of it is preparation
and focus by the centermen,"
Berenson said. "But it could also
be the winger next to him. It's
something we work on all the
time."
Berenson was known as a

you can't win a faceoff and some
nights when you can't lose (one),"
Berenson said.
Unfortunately for him, his
team didn't win them in big spots
on Friday night.
Several times in the Western
Michigan series, especially Fri-
day, Berenson called on his men
to win the scuffle at crucial stag-
es of the games - on the power
play, killing penalties and with
time winding down.
And at each critical juncture,
it seemed the puck wound up
resting comfortably on the tape
of a Bronco stick.
Take, for example, the faceoff
that lost the Wolverines the
game on Friday, a 3-2 deci-
sion. As freshman center Zach
Hyman demonstrated, winning
the draw is just half the battle.
With the game tied at two and
under a minute to play, Hyman
skated into the circle. The puck
was in the Michigan zone, and
a mistake on a faceoff so late in
the game could doom the Wol-

verines.
Hyman won the puck - but
that wasn't enough.
The Michigan defense was
slow to react and Western Mich-
igan swarmed the loose puck.
Before the team had recovered
from the draw, the puck was in
the net - a "bang, bang" play
according to Berenson. The
home winning streak was over at
20 games.
Berenson cited Hyman, Tra-
vis Lynch and Alex Guptill - all
freshmen - as impressive so far
in faceoffs. But that's hardly to
say experience is irrelevant.
Size, Berenson says, is less
important. Luckily, 5-foot-8
junior center A.J. Treais "plays
big," according to Berenson.
Treais is fast, intelligent and
intense - qualities that Beren-
son believes wins draws.
"Sometimes it's just a bad
bounce, sometimes it's just a bad
drop," Treais said.
"But those are the battles we
have to start winning."

Older isn't wiser in film

Nostalgia is inextri-
cable from culture.
The remembering of
art is almost as important as the
art itself. And among all this
remember-
ing is the
inevitable
feeling that
the art from
eras past is
better than
today's art.
This issue PHIL
was distilled CONKLIN
in Woody
Allen's
delightful "Midnight in Paris,"
that seemingly ubiquitous sum-
mer release: When you realize
the people from the eras you
romanticize were nostalgic
for earlier eras, your nostalgia
seems fatuous.
With all the detritus coming
out of Hollywood now, it's easy
to say movies are worse than
they've ever been. But this posi-
tion loses credibility considering
that, throughout the history of
movies, critics have thought the
films coming out during their
time have also been the worst
ever. To take one example, in
1980 the famed and contentious
critic Pauline Kael wrote an
essay entitled, "Why Are Mov-
ies So Bad? Or, The Numbers."
This was the year that produced
such classics as "Raging Bull,"
"The Shining" and "Star Wars:
Episode V - The Empire Strikes
Back."
The simple answer is that
Hollywood has always, and
almost exclusively, made bad
movies. With rare exceptions,
Hollywood has always trafficked
in the banal, the derivative and
the conventional. For years,
the film industry was saturated
with formulaic Westerns with
the same plots and archetypal
characters. From this quagmire
of filmic chaff, only the cream of
the Western crop has survived

CONTR A C N[
Nurses union, UMHS
praise new contract

Students continue to work
on Open Housing Initiative

Seven months
in the making,
contract passed
by2tolmargin
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
Daily Staff Reporter
University of Michigan Health
System nurses praised the ratifi-
cation of a new contract between
UMHS and the Professional Nurse
Council over the weekend and
expressed relief as seven months
of negotiations and more than 50
meetings between the two parties
came to a close.
According to Ann Sincox, a
spokeswoman for the Michigan
Nurses Association, the final
meetings to discuss the contract
took place on Friday and Satur-
day nights. Members of the Pro-
fessional Nurse Council and the
MNA voted affirmatively on the
contract late Saturday evening.
Overall, the nurses are collectively
pleased with the contract, which
extends benefits to more than
4,000 University nurses, Sincox
said.
"I think the general impression
was that this was a pretty decent
contract," she said.
The contract passed by about a
2 to 1 margin, according to Katie
Oppenheim, president of the Pro-
fessional Nurse Council. She said
University nurses were successful

in implementing many proposed
contract changes.
"As a result of all of our pushing
back on the University, we were
able to get increased language
(in the contract) around nursing
practice issues as well as language
around shifts, lunch breaks and
things like that, as well as wage
increases," Oppenheim said.
Keri Bokor, a registered nurse
in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
at the University Hospital, said
though the nurses made some sac-
rifices on behalf of UMHS, they
were warranted in light of a chal-
lenging economy.
Bokor spoke before the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents in Sep-
tember and called attention to
UMHS's plans to reduce benefits.
She said she is satisfied with the
progress both parties made in
their negotiations.
"I don't think that anybody
got everything they wanted, but
everyone got a little bit of what
they wanted," Bokor said.
UMHS released a written state-
ment on Sunday expressing its
support of the finalized contract,
which will expire in June 2014.
"We value our nurses highly, as
they play a crucial role in the qual-
ity and safety of care we provide
at UMHS," the statement reads.
"UMHS is pleased that we have
come to this agreement. We look
forward to continuing to recruit
and retain the highest caliber
nurses in the country."
Negotiations began last April

following an announcement by the
University that six nurses' sched-
ules would be altered without the
permissionofthenurses' union. In
July, the Michigan Nurses Associ-
ation filed a grievance against the
University, suggesting that UMHS
violated state law and the health
system's collective bargaining
agreement with the nurses' union.
Last month, nearly four months
after the nurses' former contract
with the University expired,-both
parties reached a tentative con-
tract agreement. Oppenheim said
at the time that the nurses were
"unanimously recommending"
the ratification of the agreement.
The tentative agreement came
after what Oppenheim called "sig-
nificant movement" by UMHS
beginning in September.
Commentingonthe lengthiness
of the negotiations, Oppenheim
said she felt the mediator involved
in discussions only complicated
the resolution of various issues.
"Once (the nurses and the Uni-
versity) started talking with each
other again, which is something
you don't do when you have a
mediator, things began to move a
bit," Oppenheim said.
Sincox praised the persistence
of the nurses' bargaining team
throughout the negotiations.
"Anytime you're going through
a contract negotiation ... it's a
long process," Sincox said. "(The
nurses) weren't going to stop until
they had gotten patientcare issues
settled."

Project aims to
have more choices
on next year's
housing form
By DANA DEL VECCHIO
For the Daily
Twenty-five students from
across campus contributed strat-
egies and solutions for gender-
neutral housing at the University
during a meeting in the Michi-
gan League last night.
The Open Housing Initiative,
first proposed by the Spectrum
Center, the University's chapter
of the American Civil Liberties
Union and later supported by the
Michigan Student Assembly last
fall, seeks to give students the
right to choose their roommate
regardless of their gender iden-
tity, gender expression or gender
non-conformity. A goal of the
initiative is to include a wider
range of open housing options on
next year's housing application,
and members plan to submit
another formal proposal to the
administration by Dec. 1.
As a result of MSA's lobbying
last year, the University current-
ly allows student requests for
gender-neutral housing. Howev-
er, the requests are dealt with on
a case-by-case basis rather than
on the general housing applica-
tion, and students must have a
roommate in mind.
Students at the forum pre-
sented aPowerPoint showingthe
number of universities across the
country that offer gender-neu-
tral housing options is steadily
rising. The University is the first
among the Big Ten schools to add
it to its agenda.
LSA sophomore Dencio Man-
glona attended the student
forum and is a member of the
Open Housing Initiative. Man-
glona has witnessed the trans-

formation of the proposal - from
its genesis with the ACLU, Spec-
trum Center and OHI to the sub-
stantive approval from MSA and
LSA Student Government.
"Seeing this initiative move
from theory and proposals to
actual boots on the ground,
meeting with University officials
- seeing that transition really
gives me hope for the future of
the University ... " Mangloma
said.
In an interview before the
event, Spectrum Center Director
Jackie Simpson highlighted the
University's history of support-
ing topics pertaining to sexual
orientation and gender orienta-
tion, including the creation ofthe
Spectrum Center in 1971.
"The University has a lot to
be proud for, but it still doesn't
mean there isn't progress to be
done," she said.
Simpson said she would like to
see an even more open policy for
students.
"I know that students would
like for anybody to room with
anybody," Simpson said. "But at
the end of the dayI'm most inter-
ested in students who identify
as transgender and gender non-
conforming to be able to have an
equitable experience as all our
students and to be able to feel
safe in the residence halls."
Simpson added that she val-
ues the student enthusiasm, but
there will still be a long-waiting
process before the University
passes any measures.
"We're talking about not
only students, but faculty, staff,
alumni, parents. The University
institution is made up of a lot
of constituents," Simpson said.
"These things take time."
In an interview last week, MSA
Vice President Brendan Camp-
bell, a member of the Open Hous-
ing Committee, said the assembly
will continue to push for further
gender-neutral policies.
"We're aiming to have chang-


es in place for next year's hous-
ing application and for the next
year of students living in the
residence halls," Campbell said.
"We're hoping that each year
we will be able to increase the
options and inclusiveness for all
students."
He added that he appreciates
the administration's support of
the initiative.
"We recognize the challenges
that the administration face,
and we're encouraged by their
willingness to work with us that
we'll be able to continue making
changes in the future," Campbell
said.
Following the presentation
portion of the forum, students
voiced their ideas for future
approaches to the initiative.
Many students agreed that the
movement's momentum rests on
spreading awareness to fresh-
men and sophomore students
who can set the precedent and
follow through with it.
LSA junior Noel Gordon said
he thinks the initiative has made
progress in LSA but needs to
reach out to other schools like
the Ford School of Public Policy
and the Ross School of Business
to gain more support.
Other students mentioned
adding gender-neutral options to
the scripts of Campus Day tours
and organizing an Education
Theater Production. The group
emphasized that open discussion
on the issue is most important,
especially for different student
organizations and student gov-
ernment representatives.
LSA senior Amy Navvab, a
founding member of OHI, moni-
tored the discussion and said she
was pleased with its outcome.
"I really appreciated the feed-
back that everyone brought to
the town hall meetings," Navvab
said. "We have a lot of new ideas
that we're definitely going to be
incorporating into our next steps
for this comingyear."

Chicago wom an accuses
Cain of sexual advances

Herman Cain's
campaign denies
allegations of
harassment
NEW YORK (AP) - Leav-
log little to the imagination, a
Chicago-area woman yesterday
accused Republican presidential
hopeful Herman Cain of mak-
ing a crude sexual advance more
than a decade ago when she was
seeking his help finding a job.
"Come clean," Sharon Bialek
challenged Cain at a news con-
ference in New York at which she
described herself as "a face and a
voice" to support other accusers
who have so far remained anony-
mous.
Cain's campaign swiftly
denied Bialek's account. "All alle-
gations of harassment against
Mr. Cain are completely false," it
said in a written statement.
Even so, Bialek's nationally
broadcast appearance on cable
television marked a new and -
for Cain - dangerous turn in a
controversy thathe has struggled
for more than a week to shed. An
upstart in the presidential race,
Cain shot to the top of public
. opinion polls in recent weeks
and emerged, however tempo-
rarily, as the main conservative
challenger to Mitt Romney.
Accompanied by her promi-
nent lawyer, Gloria Allred, Bialek
accused Cain of making a sexual

York, yesterday.

advance one night in mid-July
1997, when she had travelled to
Washington to have dinner with
him in hopes he could help her
find work.
She said the two had finished
dinner and were in acar for what
she thought was a ride to an
office building.
"Instead of going into the
offices he suddenly reached over
and he put his hand on my leg,
under my skirt toward my geni-
tals," she said.
"He also pushed my head
toward his crotch," she added.
Bialek said she told her boy-
friend, an unidentified pediatri-
cian, as well as a longtime male
friend about the episode.

None of Cain's other accusers
has provided details as graphic
as Bialek's account. But Joel Ben-
nett, an attorney who represents
one of them, said her details
were "similar in nature" to what
his client encountered.
Allred, a prominent sex dis-
crimination attorney with Dem-
ocratic ties, moved preemptively
to blunt any attacks on Bialek's
motives. She described her client
as a registered Republican, a sin-
gle mother and a woman with a
long and successful work history.
She also said Bialek "could
have attempted to sell her story
but chose not to do so," and knew
that by stepping forward, she
would receive scrutiny.

After two weeks,
homes, business
lack electricity
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -
Businesses big and small have
taken a beating from the power
outages caused by the record-
setting October snowstorm and
the losses are only beginning to
be tallied, owners and experts
said yesterday as tens of thou-
sands of Connecticut homes
and companies entered a second
week without electricity.
"I think there's going to be
a huge trickle-down effect and
we may not know the results
for several months," said Andy
Markowski, Connecticut direc-
tor for the National Federation
of Independent Business. "I
don't know of any small busi-
ness that can afford to lose a
week or more of sales. ... We're
just literally and figuratively
beginning to pick up the piec-
es."
The Oct. 29-30 storm

dumped heavy snow across the
Northeast and downed scores
of trees and utility wires. Three
million homes and businesses
lost power at the height of the
storm.
Connecticut was hit the
hardest, racking up more than
830,000 outages, and more
than 37,000 utility customers
remained in the dark Monday.
New Jersey utilities said every-
one was back on line, while
Massachusetts power compa-
nies were working to restore
electricity to about 300 custom-
ers.
The storm also is affecting
municipal elections Tuesday in
Connecticut, where nine cit-
ies and towns were moving and
consolidating their polling plac-
es. Secretary of the State Denise
Merrill said some polling loca-
tions do not yet have electricity
while others have been dam-
aged or are being used as shel-
ters and warming centers.
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has
called the duration of the out-
ages unacceptable and has

launched an independent probe
of the utilities' response. He
said the state is keeping its legal
options open in case there are
grounds for recourse in the
courts once the circumstances
are examined.
When asked how he planned
to holdl the utilities accountable
for the slow recovery response,
as he has promised, the gover-
nor said it will be through the
state's regulatory process.
"We can bring dockets and
ask for things to happen with
respect to how they conduct
their business and what way
they conduct their business and
what they recover losses for, for
instance," said the governor,
who said he presumed that the
investigation of Connecticut
Light and Power, the state's
largest utility, would uncover
"some degree of malfeasance"
and could lead to legal action by
the state.
Some homes and businesses
weren't expected to get their
power back until Wednesday
night.

PROPOSAL 3: EMPLOYEES'
RETIREMENT BOARD
If passed, Proposal 3 would
add two citizen trustees to the
Employees' Retirement Board -
currently a nine-person group
that responds to city of Ann Arbor
employee retirement system
issues in the city.

The proposal stems from a
2005 report by the city of Ann
Arbor Blue Ribbon Committee.
The 2005 report recommends
that the citizen trustees have
"significant experience" in pen-
sion care administration, pension
actuarial practices, investment
management, finance, business,
banking, certified public account-
ing and/or law. The Blue Ribbon
Cpnittee aimed to have the
council eliminate potential con-
flicts of interest within the board.
However, while the 2005
report recommends the city
administrator have a spot on the
board - which he currently does
- the current proposal would

remove that post.
City Council member Stephen
Eapundalo (D-Ward 2) said he
was one of the people to introduce
these recommendations for the
ballot once they were ready.
"The proposal essentially calls
for getting rid of the city admin-
istrator (spot on the board) and
ensure that there's more citizens
than beneficiaries," Rapundalo
said.
Though the committee's rec-
ommendations were made six I
years ago, Rapundalo said he
doesn't think it lacks relevance.
"What the task force found
then is just as valid today,"
Rapundalo said.

Census: Wealth gap widening between generations in U.S.

People older than
65 have a networth
47 times greater
than those under 35
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
wealth gap between younger and
older Americans has stretched to
the widest on record, worsened by
a prolonged economic downturn
that has wiped out job opportuni-
ties for young adults and saddled
them with housing and college
debt.
The typical U.S. household
headed by a person age 65 or older
has a net worth 47 times greater

than a household headed by some-
one under 35, according to an
analysis of census data released
yesterday.
While people typically accumu-
late assets as they age, this gap is.
now more than double what it was
in 2005 and nearly five times the
10-to-1 disparity a quarter-centu-
ry ago, after adjusting for inflation.
The analysis by the Pew
Research Centere rflets the"
impact of the economic downturn,
which has hit young adults par-
ticularly hard. More are pursuing
college or advanced degrees, tak-
ing on debt as they wait forthe
job market to recover. Others are
struggling to pay mortgage costs
on homes now worth less than

when they were bought in the
housing boom.
The report, coming out before
the Nov. 23 deadline for a special
congressional committee to pro-
pose $1.2 trillion in budget cuts
over 10 years, casts a spotlight on
a government safety net that has
buoyed oderAmericans on Social
Security and Medicare amid wider
cuts to education and other pro-
grams. Complaints about wealth
inequality, high unemployment
and student debt also have been
front and center at Occupy Wall
Street protests around the country.
"It makes is wonder whether
the extraordinary amount of
resources we spend on retirees
and their health care should be

at least partially reallocated to and savings accumulated over
those who are hurting worse than the years, including stocks, bank

of a person's home, possessions percent for Americans 65 or older,

compared to the official 9 percent
rate reported in September. Work-
ing-age adults ages 18-64 also saw
increases in poverty - from 13.7
percentto 15.2 percent.
Nancy LeaMond, an executive
vice president of AARP, noted that
older Americans spend a dispro -I
portionate share of their income
on out-of-pocket medical care,
compared to other groups. "Mil-
lions of older Americans today
continue to struggle to make
ends meet," she said. "Many older
Americans do own their homes, 4
but plummeting housing values
- along with dwindling savings,
stagnant pensions and prolonged
periods of unemployment - have
taken their toll."
