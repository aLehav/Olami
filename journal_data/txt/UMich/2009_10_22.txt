AD Bill Martin announces retirement

In facilities and
finances, Martin
found his legacy

New search process a
chance to reshape job,
not just pick successor

By COURTNEY RATKOWIAK
Managing Editor
Fielding Yost, Michigan's first
athletic director, built Michigan
Stadium at a time when the idea of
seating 100,000 people in a "hole-
in-the-ground" stadium was seen
as unnecessary and unprecedented.
In convincing fashion, he proved
his dissenters wrong by attracting
a sellout crowd in the 1927 home
dedication game. The stadium cur-
rently remains the most prominent
symbol ofYost'sinfluence on Mich-
igan athletics.
Though Bill Martin - who
announced his retirement as ath-
letic director yesterday - didn't
have to build the stadium from
the ground up, the $226 million
Big House renovation project that
broke ground in 2007 is the epito-
me of what will likely be his last-

ing legacy.
With the Michigan Stadium
renovations almost complete and
the re-dedication ceremony sched-
uled for next year's football sea-
son opener, Martin announced his
Sept. 4, 2010 retirement in a letter
to University President Mary Sue
Coleman and during an Athletic
Department staff-wide meeting in
Cliff Keen Arena.
Martin, who championed the
role of a nearly autonomous ath-
letic director in a job where he
stayed much longer than he origi-
nally intended, will leave his mark
on Michigan athletics in a nearly
unparalleled fashion. His legacy
spans from quelling internal finan-
cial concerns to spearheading the
renovation and construction of
numerous athletic facilities.
In his letter to Coleman, Martin

Soon after Athletic Director Bill
Martin submitted a letter to Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Cole-
man announcing his retirement
effective next year and shared
the announcement with Athletic
Department staff in a department-
wide meeting yesterday, specula-
tion began over who would succeed
Martin as athletic director.
Though many names were
floated among members of the
University community yesterday,,
University executives have not yet'
released the names of any possible
replacements.
In a statement released yester-
day, Coleman wrote she would
manage the process of hiring anew
athletic director.
"I will personally oversee the
search for the next Athletic Direc-

tor with the help of a small advi-
sory group," Coleman wrote. "We
expect this process will take anum-
ber of months. With this advance
notice, we have the opportunity
to make a thoughtful and deliber-
ate choice and to manage a smooth
transition."
Similar to the process used
when Bill Martin was hired as ath-
letic director in 2000, the advisory
committee will recommend candi-
dates for Coleman's consideration,
though the final decision will be up
to the University president.
In an interview yesterday, Uni-
versity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
said no one has been asked to serve
on the advisory committee yet.
Fitzgerald also said Coleman will
personally choose the committee
members.

For the fifth year in a row, stu-
dents from the University have
been awarded upwards of 20 Ful-
bright Scholar Program grants.
A list of top U.S. producers of
Fulbright students for the 2009-
2010 academic year published by
the Chronicle of Higher Education
shows that of the University's 111
applicants to the U.S. Student Pro-
gram, 28 have thus far received and
accepted the grants.
Additionally, the University
ranked near the top in the Ful-
bright Scholar Program, with seven
faculty members receiving grants.
According to Amy Kehoe, Ful-
bright coordinator for the Univer-
sity, the names of the 2009-2010
recipients from the University have
yet to be released in print. They are
expected to be made public either
today or tomorrow.
Sponsored by the U.S. Depart-
ment of State, the Fulbright pro-
gram functions as an international
exchange program for students
and university professionals and
faculty, allowing them to conduct
researchundertake graduate study
and teach in schools globally.
Last year, 144 students - a record
high for the University - applied for
the Fulbright program, with a com-
bination of 31 undergraduate and
graduate students receiving grants.
The University has led the country

U. of Michigan at Ann Arbor

in Fulbright winners in three out of
the last five years.
Mark Tessler, director of the
University'sInternationalinstitute,
said that while it would be nice to
have the most grants every year, it's
not a realistic goal. He added that
despite the fact that the University
has fewer grant recipients this year,
it still remains a Fulbright power-
house.
"If we're three or four students
less this year, I don't think that's
really important," he said. "We're
really proud of the program and to
be in the company of these other
universities."
Leadingthe researchinstitutions
in recipients this year are North-
western University with 32 grants,
the University of Chicago with 31
and Brown University with 29.
Tessler noted that within the
top 10 institutions, the University
of Michigan is the only public uni-
versity.
"Everybody else on that list,
they are all private schools with a
very different funding base, a very
different student clientele," Tes-
sler said. "Our participation in the
Fulbright program is our pride and
joy."
Kehoe wrote in an e-mail that
she was delighted but not surprised

that the University received so
many awards.
"I did see the ranking and was
pleased to see that Michigan is yet
again a top-producing Fulbright
institution," she wrote.
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham wrote in an e-mail
that she was happy to see Universi-
ty students were once again among
the top grant winners.
"The University of Michigan is
gratified by the Fulbright Scholar-
ship program's continuing recog-
nition of the extraordinary caliber
of our students," she wrote in the
e-mail.
Applicants submit their applica-
tion materials in September for the
subsequent year, and recipients are
announced the following October.
In recent years, the Fulbright has
sent around 1,550 students and
1,250 scholars to over 155 coun-
tries, spendingclose to $275 million
annually in grant money.
According to Schuyler Allen,
senior program officer for the Ful-
bright Student Program Outreach
team, the University of Michigan
has produced 317 student recipi-
ents since 1993. Their areas of study
have ranged from public health to
music composition to East Asian

Turning the Diag into a campus auction house

Football ticketa these days for
seats on the 50-yard line could fetch
upwards of $100, but back in 1962,
they were auctioned off for a mere
$15.
The tickets were a part of the
World University Service Auction,
a program on campus where profes-
sors auctioned off campus luxuries,
goods and other services.
According to an article in The
Michigan Daily on March 15, 1962,
items auctioned off included a fac-
ulty parking permit for a $22, four
season passes at the Cinema Guild
for $5.50, and even a dinner with
then-University President Harlan
Hatcher and his wife for $17.
Mavin Felheim, an energetic and
sarcastic professor, acted as faux
auctioneer during the event on the
Diag, according to the Daily article.
Eager students lined up to bid on

Gov.: Next round of
cuts will come, but
targets not decided
Gov. Jennifer Granhoim said
yesterday she hasn't decided where
she'll make cuts in the six remain-
ing budget bills on her desk.
But the money she vetoed ear-
lier this week from a public schools
budget is still causing waves.
The Democratic governor said
Tuesday she was forced to veto $51
million targeted for 39 school dis-
tricts from the education budget
because lawmakers didn't include
enough money to pay for the bill
as revenues have fallen. Senate
Republicans deny that and say she's
using schoolchildren as pawns to
push for higher taxes.
The State Board of Education
has moved up its regularly sched-
uled November meeting to Monday
to address education financing. The
board originally was to meet Nov.
10. The public schools budget was
cut 2.9 percent in the new budget
year that just started.
WASHINGTON D.C.
New undercover
ACORN tape
released
Two conservative activists
released a new undercover video
targeting the community organizing
group ACORN yesterday, an attempt
to reignite a simmering political con-
troversy surrounding the Democrat-
ic-leaningorganization.
The new videotape shows film-
makers Hannah Giles and James
O'Keefe, posing as a prostitute and
her boyfriend, soliciting advice
about a possible housing loan from
workers in the Philadelphia office
of ACORN Housing Corp.
Previousvideos showedthe same
pair, also posing as a prostitute and
her boyfriend, visiting ACORN
offices in other cities.
The Philadelphia visit is signifi-
cant because of a dispute over state-
ments ACORN has made defending
what took place when Giles and
O'Keefe visited the Philadelphia
office last summer.
ORANGE PARK, Fla. -
Body found but
not identified as
missing girl
Authorities saytheyhave not iden-
tified a child's body they found yes-
terday in a landfill while searching
for a missing 7-year-old girl. Family
members were hopeful the girl is still
alive, though neighbors in the girl's
community feared the worst.
The partially covered body of the
child was found in a Georgia land-
fill near the Florida state line, after
investigators followed garbage
trucks leaving from the neighbor-
hood where Somer Thompson dis-
appeared Monday.
'Sheriff Rick Beseler said investi-
gators searched through 100 tons of
garbage before findingthe body. He
first said the body was female, then

corrected himself to say he could
not confirm the gender.
Few other details about the
body, such as a possible cause of
death, were released. The Georgia
Bureau of Investigation planned an
autopsy Thursday.

Police crack down on
gangs after 32 deaths
Police in Rio expanded a crack-
down on gangs beyond the area
hit by a wave of killings that has
claimed at least 32 lives since the
weekend, officials said yesterday.
The clashes came less than three
weeks after the city was awarded
the 2016 Olympic Games. They
began when a drug gang tried to
invade a rival's territory and three
policemen were killed when a heli-
copter was shot down by gunfire
over the weekend.
Subsequent firefights between
policeandheavilyarmedgangmem-
bers have left the affected slums in
chaos. Hundreds of residents fled
their homes overnight, choosing
to sleep in streets away from their
own neighborhoods after rumors
spread that drug gangs were set to
battle again.
While the violence began in a
northern area near the Maracana
stadium, which will host the Olym-
pics' opening and closing ceremo-
nies, police searching for suspects
behind the downing ofthe helicopter
launched operations in slums in Rio's
south and center on Wednesday.

2 years after trial,
woman recants story

Six people jailed
for the torture of
a woman who now
admits she lied
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -
Megan Williams' shocking accu-
sations initially strained the
imagination: Seven white people
beat her with sticks, forced her to
eat feces, raped her and taunted
her with racial slurs over several
days in a ramshackle trailer in
West Virginia.
But the suspects eventually
confessed to their actions and
pleaded guilty. All but one were
sent to prison. Now Williams, who
is black, is taking it all back.
Williams lied in 2007 because
she wanted to get back at a boy-
friend who had beaten her, her
attorney, Byron L. Potts, said yes-
terday at a news conference in his
Columbus office.
Williams no longer wants to live
a lie, Potts said.
"She told me the only thing not
self-inflicted were the bruises on
her face," Potts said.
Williams, 22, who now lives
with a caregiver in Columbus, was

From Page 1A
made it clear that with his most
treasured construction projects
now either approved or nearing
completion, it was time to step
down.
"We've discussed my retire-
ment for a couple of years now,
and I agreed to stay on to make
sure the (football) stadium proj-
ectwouldbe finished asplanned,"
Martin wrote. "In the last few
months I have had the chance
to make significant progress on
other issues that needed to be
set on a firm foundation as well,
including plans for the basketball
practice facility, so I think it is
now time to plan for the future."
Associate Athletic Direc-
tor Bruce Madej said he was
"caugit by surprae"._wben Mar-
tin announced his retirement.
Madej knew that Martin was
likely planning to retire after he
launched the construction of the
aforementioned $23 million bas-
ketball practice facility, sched-
uled to be completed in 2011, but
said he thought Martin would
retire in Jangsry 2011 instead of
next September.
The regents approved the con-
struction of the basketball prac-
tice facility in January 2009 and
approved schematic designs 0'
September 2009.
"If you read between the lines,
after the (Michigan) Stadium ren-
ovations, he had one more project
that he wanted to do - the basket-
ball facilities that he got off the
ground," Madej said. "Once that
was set, I knew he had accom-
plished what he wanted to."
Martin also oversaw the con-
struction of the Al Glick Field
House, a $26.1 million indoor
football practice facility that
opened in August 2009. Other
Martin-led projects have includ-
ed the completed Alumni Field
($5.5 million) and Fisher Stadium
($9 million) renovations and the
$6 million construction of a new
soccer stadium, approved by the

regents in May 2009.
But even while dealing with
teams that haven't needed as
much hands-on leadership or
massive facility overhauls, Mar-
tin's business sense has been
apparent.
"I showed him my idea of put-
ting a balcony in Yost (Ice Arena),
and he said, 'It's a no-brainer, we
have to do it,"' Michigan hockey
coach Red Berenson said. "I'd
been talking about that for five
years and nobody listened. But
Bill Martin could see, 'Look, this
will pay itself off in three years
and it'll make the building that
much more hospitable and add so
much to the building.' He's been
very supportive of anythingwe've
needed in the hockey program."
Over the past decade, Martin
has also had a hand in bring-
ing many of Michigan's current
coaches to Ann Arbor. But his
reputation for selecting coaches
may rest most on the success of
football coach Rich Rodriguez,
who was hired by Martin in
December 2007.
Rodriguez's hiring came after
Martin had been intensely scru-
tinized by the national media
for how he handled the coaching
search.4

in the office with Potts, but she did
not appear before reporters. Potts
said she has received several anon-
ymous phone calls from people
threatening her life.
"She is recantingthe entire inci-
dent. She says it did not happen,
and she's scared," Potts said.
Seven white men and women
were convicted in the case, in
which Williams had also said that
hot wax was poured on her and
that two of her captors had forced
her to drink their urine.
Policesaidthe assaults occurred
at a trailer owned by Frankie
Brewster in a rural area of Logan
County, about 50 miles from
Charleston, W.Va. Williams was
rescued after an anonymous caller
alerted authorities.
Potts said that Brewster's son,
Bobby, was the boyfriend who had
beaten Williams and that she had
stabbed herself with a straight
razor to help embellish the story
of being tortured.
Prosecutors, who knew about
the relationship even during the
case, dismissed Williams' new
claim, and lawyers for the defen-
dants would not discuss their
plans. Williams' supporters were
cautious about responding to the
statement by a woman whose
Martin had received permis-
sion to talk to current Louisiana
State University coach Les Miles
after his Southeastern Conference
championship game, but ESPN
reported on the day of the game
that Miles had already accepted
an offer with Michigan. Miles
angrily called a press conference
to refute the rumors and later
signed a contract extension with
LSU, which left Martin to answer
a barrage of questions relating to
his interactions with Miles and
his coaching search etiquette.
In the end, Martin hired
Rodriguez, who led Michigan to
its worst record in school history
(3-9) in 2008. The team is cur-
rently 5-2 in 2009.
"We've had probably a lifetime
of stories in less than two years.
I think that's natural when you
have a transition," Rodriguez said
beo visterday's football prac-,
tice. "We had a lot of laughs and
we've had a few tough moments,
but I'm hoping that we, over the
next 10 to 12 months that he has
left as athletic director, have a lot
of good moments to share as well.
We've been through some pain
together, and we'd like to have
some good moments for sure."
Martin's other big hires include
Michigan basketball coach John
Beilein, who led the Wolverines
to their first NCAA Tournament
appearance in 11 years last season,
and Michigan baseball coach Rich
Maloney, who has coached Michi-
gan to three Big Ten titles and an
NCAA Regional title in 2007.
"We were all kind of shocked,"
Maloney said of Martin's retire-
ment. "I mean, we knew at some
point this would happen. He
didn't have to have this job. He's a
very successful businessman, and
he really took the job because he
loves Michigan. And that's been
very apparent to me in working
with him over the years - his
love is very, very deep.
"I'm very appreciative he gave
me a chance to come to Michi-
gan, and this was a place where I
dreamt of coming to as a student
athlete and didn't get the oppor-

tunity. And to come back as a
coach, I will always be indebted
to Bill for that."
Martin's legacy of construction
and hires maybe more impressive
given the conditions in which he
entered the post of athletic direc-
tor. As soon as he took the job, he
immediately found himself faced
with digging Michigan out of a
financial hole and repairing the
school's damaged reputation.
After former University Presi-
dent Lee Bollinger forced then-
Athletic Director Tom Goss to
resign, Martin took over the ath-
letic director post on an interim
basis on March 6, 2000. He was
permanently named athletic
director on Aug. 1 of the same
year.
The multimillionairebusiness-
man, who successfully founded
the real estate firm First Martin
Corporation in 1968 and the Bank
of Ann Arbor in 1995, wasn't
accustomed to seeing a business
so deep in the red. The Athletic
Department suffered a $2.8 mil-
lion deficit for the 1999 fiscal
year, according to a Feb. 14, 2000
article in the University Record.
In the 2001 fiscal year, the
introduction of varsity women's
water polo and varsity men's soc-

mother described her during the
2007 case as "slow."
Potts urged prosecutors in West
Virginia to re-evaluate the case
and he said that Williams wants
people convicted to be released
from prison.
Brian Abraham, the former
Logan County prosecutor who
pursued the cases, said authori-
ties realized early in the investi-
gation that they could not rely on
statements from Williams, who
tended to embellish and exagger-
ate details. Instead, he said, the
seven defendants were convicted
on their own statements and phys-
ical evidence.
"If she's going to say that she
made it all up, that's absurd,"
Abraham said. "This looks like
another attempt to generate more
publicity."
Potts said he did not know why
the defendants have pleaded guilty
to something they did not do.
He said Williams is aware
that she could face legal conse-
quences for fabricating the story
and that he wants to have her
psychologically evaluated. He
said Williams told him certain
people were controlling her and
influencing her during the case.
He did not elaborate.

Science sells
Venture Center a good way to bring 'U' innovation to world
T he University has already established itself as a hub of
research and innovation. On Oct. 13, the University is
already among the top 10 colleges in the country for cre-
ating startup companies based on university-licensed inventions
and technologies. And with the creation of the new Michigan
Venture Center, the University will be able to do an even bet-
ter job of bridging the gap between innovation and enterprise.
Researchers and professors interesting in marketing their inno-
vations should take full advantage of the Michigan Venture Cen-
ter and give the state economy a much-needed edge in the field
of new technology.

The Michigan venture Center will,
according to a University press release,
"help faculty inventors create business
plans, assess a technology's commercial-
ization potential, deal with intellectual
property issues, attract investors and
acquire gap funding to enhance the mar-
ket appeal of a new technology." Jim
O'Connell, the associate director for busi-
ness formation at the University's Office of
Technology Transfer, will lead the venture
Center. He hopes to increase the number
of average science-based startups per year
at the University from nine to 12 by giving
professors new incentives and opportuni-
ties for research.
The launching of the Venture Cen-
ter comes just two weeks after President
Mary Sue Coleman announced in her State
of the University address that the Univer-
sity would put more money into research
than ever before. The Venture Center is a
great opportunity to turn the innovations
that grow out of this research money into
benefits for the University, and by exten-
sion the state economy and consumers.
Researchers who want to bring their prod-
ucts to the market will now have a better
resource to connect them with businesses
that can sell the product. More start-
ups will bring enormous benefits to the
University's reputation as a place of new

developments, as well as offering real tech-
nological improvements for the world.
After all, science-based startups are just
what Michigan needs to carve out a niche
for itself in a modernizing U.S. economy.
Bringing the best and brightest minds to
the state and then offering them resources
to market their innovations will contribute
to the transformation of the state economy
into one that favors science and research.
Michigan's economy could certainly use
the boost that the Venture Center will pro-
vide.
And when scientists are given the
resources to make their developments
widely available, everyone wins. New
technologies are constantly revolutioniz-
ing the world and improving the quality of
life. Scientific leaders - like the University
- can always use more programs like the
Venture Center to close the gap between
the development and marketing stages of
innovation.
Professors and researchers who are
interested in patenting their work should
take full advantage of what ;he Venture
Center has to offer. Some of the country's
most interesting and important research is
being done here at the University, and the
Venture Center will help these exciting
innovations make the leap from prototype
to reality.

U Housing deserves more
credit than Caleca gave it
TO THE DAILY:
In his column, Ben Caleca offered some
thoughtful ideas (Going green, the slow way,
10/13/2009). He understated, however, the
investment in locally grown foods by Univer-
sity Housing. Offering more than an occasional
sustainable meal, Residential Dining Services
has been expanding its efforts to regularly
include local produce and food products - first
in East Quad and now in nearly all dining hall
menus.
Despite the challenge of Michigan's growing
season - shorter than the local season for UNC
HARUN BULJINA

Chapel Hill, which Caleca held out as an example
- local produce and products account for nearly
20 percent of the RDS food budget. We hope to
increase our selection of local foods as we devel-
op additional contracts with local farmers and
producers.
We think it is supportive of Caleca's perspec-
tive to mention that University Housing has been
seriously engaged in promoting recycling and
sustainable activities in the residence halls and
Northwood Community for many, many years.
With the support of the students, we can, and
shall, continue to do more. For more information,

f you were away from TV dur-
ing Fall Break, you might have
missed the ridiculous drama of
The Colorado Bal-
loon Incident. The
Heene family of
Fort Collins, Colo.,
ignited a media
firestorm after the
family's father,
Richard Heene,
told authorities in
a desperate 911 call
that his six-year- CHRIS
old son, FalconK
was floating away KOSLOWSKI
aboard a home-
made flying saucer-
shaped balloon that came loose from
its mooring in the Heenes' backyard.
After a 50-mile journey, the balloon
crash-landed, but little Falcon was
nowhere to be found.
Thinking the boy might have fallen
out during the flight, law enforce-
ment launched a search and soon
discovered Falcon had been hiding in
the Heenes' garage the entire time.
Richard Heene claimed he sincerely
thought his son had climbed aboard
the saucer, but in a Wolf Blitzer inter-
view, Falcon let slipthatthe family had
put on the whole event "for the show."
The next morning, in a live interview
with NBC's Today Show, Falcon vom-
ited when his father tried to justify
his son's comments. Now the Larimer
County sheriff's office is certain that
the Heenes, who previously appeared
on ABC's reality show "Wife Swap,"
faked the whole incident asa publicity
stunt to market themselves for their
own reality TV series.
The Colorado Balloon Incident is
just the latest media frenzy seemingly
motivated by a desire for reality fame.
You might recall Nadya Suleman, the
"Octo-mom," who signed a deal with
a European production company ear-
lier this year to star her own real-

ity show. She gave birth to octuplets
conceived through in-vitro fertiliza-
tion paid for in government disability
money.
I'm sure many of us see the atten-
tion Balloon Boy and Octo-mom
receive and lament how reality tele-
vision has tainted a medium we once
couldtrust. Television, includinglocal
and cable news, has transformed into
its own brand of yellow journalism,
where sensation trumps substance
every time. I'm baffled how Suleman
and the Heene family so easily hood-
winked us all into giving them atten-
tion. Some might blame the public
for lapping up celebrity gossip, shock
news and soap opera programming.
Others might impugn the networks
for shoving this garbage down our
throats. Almost universally, though,
people think this phenomenon of
sensationalism is a bad influence. I
disagree.
I despise Octo-mom. And as much
guilty pleasure I take from watch-
ing the Heene family train wreck,
I'm quickly tiring of them, too. In a
less perfect world, I would be forced
to endure this drivel until the next
ridiculous story broke, but thank-
fully I hold in my hands the ultimate
power in the universe - the remote
control. Over-hyped stories like these
remind me and millions of others that
we have the power to decide what we
watch and the responsibility to ques-
tion what is being presented to us as
news or truth.
The "trusted newsmen" era of
Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather and
others lulled Americans into compla-
cency. People trusted Uncle Walter
to be a one-stop shop for news. Now
with radio, television, the Internet
and hundreds of news sources within.
those different channels all compet-
ing for the public's attention, people
are better able to decide what they
consider newsworthy. Overtly sen-

sationalist reporting is easier to pick
out and avoid, and most importantly,
it exposes the hidden motivation
behind many news organizations: to
make a profit.
The more people who realize news
sources, just like anything else in our
great capitalist nation, are primar-
ily out to make a buck, the better,
smarter and more discriminating
we become as consumers of news.
You don't need me to tell you that a
smarter audience, willing to seek out
truth for themselves, is better than
the apathetic alternative. Viewers
are finally realizing that reality TV
is often anything but. Rather than
Viewers need to sift
through garbage to
get to smart news.
watching what's fed to them, smart-
er viewers decide to sift through
the trash to find programming they
appreciate. It might be annoying, but
the wisdom and experience that the
sifting helps create far outweighs the
negative effects of exposure to sensa-
tionalism.
We shouldn't forget that many'
people are actually entertained by
the real life drama of a kid-in-a-fly-
ing-saucer hoax, and that's fine. If
after a long day someone is looking
for something to make them laugh or
pique their curiosity, I have no prob-
lem with Octo-mom filling that need.
As terrible as they seem, these sensa-
tional scandals have the potential to
help everybody - as long as we keep
fresh batteries in our remotes.

Emotional, one-
goal loss takes toll
on Coach Pankratz

By MICHAEL LAURILA
For the Daily
As time expired in yesterday's
Michigan fieldhockeygame against
Kent State, coach Marcia Pank-
ratz epitomizes the Wolverines'
frustration perfectly. She angrily
asked the referee "if he wanted to
take this into the parking lot" as
he walked
away, the MICHIGAN 0
outburst KENT STATE 1
relatingto
the lack of penalties called against
the Golden Flashes.
Throughout the 1-0 loss, the
Wolverines could not get their
offense going and had few, if any,
good scoring opportunities.
"Kent State played inspired
today," Pankratz said. "We just
couldn't get the ball into the goal,
and when we got to the 25-yard-
line, our attack kind of bogged
down and got stagnant."
Throughoutthe year, Michigan
has been a very successful scoring
team, especially when it has had
corner opportunities. In yester-
day's game, the Wolverines didn't
have a corner until there was 2:25
left in the second half, and they
could not string together a series
of passes to get things going. Pank-
ratz said that Michigan's lack of
corners was definitely a problem.
"We didn't get any corners
called for us," she said. "We just

got to try to work on our finite
skills in drawing corners and get
some shots in the circle."
Before Kent State senior Laurie
Wilkins scored with 12:45 remain-
inginthesecond halfoffofadeflec-
tion in the air, the Wolverines had
shut down numerous Kent State
scoring opportunities. Whether
it was due to apathetic players or
questionable calls by referees, all
three Michigan coaches showed
frustration during the game.
Even though the Wolverines
came in as the favorite, the Golden
Flashes had the most recent victo-
ry in the all-time series, a 1-0 win
last year in Ann Arbor. Coming
into this game with a10-3-3 record
against Kent State and a 7-9 over-
all record this season, Michigan
was looking to avenge its loss last
season and improve its sub-500
record this year.
This season, juniors Meredith
Way and Alicia Mayer, have led the
Michigan offense. The junior duo
has a combined 21 goals and five
assiststhis season, which accounts
for half of the team's entire goal
count. But they were held almost
shotless and could not get any-
thing going yesterday.
The Wolverines next face Mich-
igan State, a team that is coming
in with a 12-3 overall record and a
3-0 conference record. With a big
win, Michigan could get its season
back on the right track.

Junior Troy Woolfolk, who played cornerback last year but moved back to strong safety before the start of the 2009 season, has now switched backto corner.
Woolfolk could stay at
corner permanently

By ANDY REID
DailySportsEditor
Troy Woolfolk's move from
safety to cornerback in the week
leading up to the Iowa game had
all the makings of a temporary
switch. There were questions at
the position, but the coaching
staff seemed to be fixing them
quickly.
Boubacar Cissoko, the original
starting corner, had'fallen out of
the coaching staff's favor and was
suspended for "a violation of team
rules."-And his backup, J.T. Floyd,
seemed to be on the brink of suc-
cess, but just needed a little more
time. In order to shore up the field
opposite defensive stalwart Don-
ovan Warren, the coaches decided
Woolfolk could work - until Cis-
soko or Floyd came around - and
moved walk-on Jordan Kovacs to
Woolfolk's strong safety position.
What a difference a couple
weeks make.
"If we get in a pinch, we can
put Troy back (to safety)," Michi-
gan coach Rich Rodriguez said
yesterday. "But there's so much
different teaching to learn, so
we want to get Troy settled in at
corner. Him and Boubacar (need)
to get solid there. Depending on

the emergence of Floyd and some
of the other guys, we'll see what
happens."
Woolfolk played cornerback
all last season, switching to safe-
ty before the 2009 season. The
logic behind the initial was that
his blistering speed could help
eliminate big plays, which were a
huge problem for the 2008 Wol-
verines.

guez said when asked where
Woolfolk should ideally line up.
"(The defensive coaches) feel
more comfortable with Troy now
at corner and try to develop more
depth and conpetition at safety.
But an injury could change that.
As we stand today, they feel good
with where the guys are at."
So far, Wolverine defenders

is most effective. But Woolfolk's reemergence
"That's a good question, and at cornerback doesn't mean
we've gone back and forth talking Floyd and Cissoko won't get any
with the defensive staff," Rodri- reps. Since Cissoko's suspension,

Rodriguez has maintained that
his return to the playing field will
be determined by his actions off it
- both in the classroom and in his
interaction with the team.
And it seems as if Cissoko is
making the proper strides in both
departments.
Although Rodriguez had been
firm in his stance that Cissoko
will not play, he seemed to take
a softer approach to the Detroit
native's case whenie met with
the media yesterday.
"It really depends on the next
couple days whether he plays or
not on Saturday," Rodriguez said.
"He won't start, but whether he
dresses, is allowed to travel or has
the opportunity to play depends
on the next couple of days."
As for Floyd, he was one of very
few players not to see game action
against Delaware State last week-
end. But the benching had noth-
ing to do with his progression at
cornerback - he was very sick
leading into the game.
"I saw J.T. last night after prac-
tice, and-he was feeling a lot bet-
ter," Rodriguez said. "He was hit
really hard with the flu. He feels
a lot better now, so hopefully he'll
get back in the mix and play some
for us."

The infamous block 'M is
returning to the Big House for
Saturday's Penn State game.

Life is callin. How far will you go?

By COURTNEY RATKOWIAK
DailySportsEditor
For both quarterbacks starting
in Saturday's game, the man on the
other sideline will look very familiar.
Fifth-year senior quarterback
Daryll Clark
ended up com- _NTE___K_
mitting to Penn
State, but his first scholarship offer
was from West Virginia and now-
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez.
"There's just something about
them," Clark, a three-star recruit,
told-rivals.com in 2003. "I camped
up there, and I have been excited
about them ever since that. They
were like the first team to come
after me and offer me. That's some-
thing that is important to me."
West Virginia was Clark's initial
frontrunner, but after he visited
State College in December 2003,
Penn State became his favorite. He
eventually eliminated Rodriguez's
team from consideration, but he
and Rodriguez were still friendly
when they ran into each other at
Big Ten Media Day in July.
"We recruited him a little bit,"
Rodriguez said Monday. "He's an
outstanding athlete. He's achieved
an awful lot. I think he's one of the
best quarterbacks in the country."
Though Rodriguez remembered
recruiting Clark, Penn State coach
Joe Paterno couldn't recall many
specifics about recruiting now-
Michigan freshman quarterback
Tate Forcier.
"I think he may have only been
a junior when he came, and he was
from a long way off, and I don't

know whether I spent a lot of time
withhim,"Paternosaid."Youknow,
well-presented, looked good, spoke
well, very, very modest about his
achievements, those kind of things.
"I remember that about him, but
we just didn't get close enough for
me to really say I knew him well."
Forcier was on the sidelines for
the Penn State-Ohio State game
in October 2007, and Penn State
mailed its offer letter to Forcier on
Feb. 6, 2008, with a handwritten
addendum by Paterno at the end.
"P.S. Tate - We hope you have
interest in Penn State and that 2008
will be a great year for you. Joe P,"
Paterno wrote, according to the
scanned-in offer letter on the Forcier
family website, QBforce.com.
MOLK TO START SATURDAY:
Rodriguez confirmed yesterday
that center David Molk will start
at center against Penn State this
weekend, with David Moosman
at guard and either Perry Dor-
restein or Mark Huyge at tackle.
Molk broke his foot against East-
ern Michigan on Sept. 19 and was
originally projected to be out four
to six weeks.
The redshirt sophomore had sur-
gery on his foot on the Monday after
the Eastern Michigan game and fre-
quently used what Rodriguez called
a "bone stimulator," a device that the
coach said could be applied to the
foot to accelerate healing.
Molk was cleared to practice ear-
lier this week, and Rodriguez said
Monday that Tuesday's full-contact
practice would be the bestbarometer
for Molk's readiness. By the time he
playsonSaturday, hewillhavesatout

for exactly five weeks.
"He did quite a bit yesterday in
full pads," Rodriguez said yesterday.
"The report today from the trainers
is that he handled it well. He was a
little sore, as could be expected, butI
think he came through it all well. He
should be fine for Saturday."
INJURY UPDATE: Rodriguez
said Forcier's head (concussion) and
shoulder are both feeling better,
which can be attributed to sitting out
for most of Saturday's game against
Delaware State. Forcier participated
in full practices Monday and Tues-
day, which he had not been able to

do for weeks.
"The head thing has cleared up,
but with the shoulder, he's able to get
more zip onthe ball and run around a
little more," Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez also said that backup
cornerback J.T. Floyd was feeling "a
lot better" yesterday after coming
down with the flu and missing last
week'sgame against Delaware State.
With Floyd healthy again, the cor-
nerback position will have a bit more
depth Saturday, though cornerback-
turned-safety-turned-cornerback
Troy Woolfolk will still start oppo-
site junior Donovan Warren.

P SPECULATION
From Page 1A
versity regent David Brandon has
been highlighted as one of the pri-
mary frontrunners.
Brandon, the current president
and CEO of Domino's Pizza, played
as a back-up quarterback for Michi-
gan and was on threeBig Ten Cham-
pionship teams during his years at
the University in the early 1970s,
though he does not have any experi-
ence as an athletic director.
However, Brandon, 57, does run
a company with annual sales of $6
billion and has stayed very active
in University affairs. He has vol-
unteered time and money to help
spearhead the campaign to build
the University's new C.S. Mott Chil-
dren's Hospital and Women's Hos-
pital and renovate the University of
Michigan Museum of Art.
Inaninterview yesterday,Brandon
said pickingMartin'ssuccessorshould
be left to Coleman's discretion.
"It's not a job to campaign for.
It's not a job that gets elected. It's a
job that (Coleman) needs to choose
based on her criteria," Brandon said.
"Only Mary Sue Coleman knows
what she wants to do and how she
wants to do it."
Asked whether he wouldbe inter-
ested in becoming the University's
athletic director, Brandon would
not confirm or deny whether he had
any interest in the position.
"Iamnotcampaigningfor, against,
involved or uninvolved," Brandon
said. "I'm doing what I do for a liv-
ing and that is, right now, running
my Domino's Pizza corporation, and
that's ajob that I love very much."
Universitylecturer JohnU.Bacon
- a noted journalist and historian
of Michigan athletics - included
Brandon on his list of people he feels
are contenders for the job.
Bacon also mentioned current
Miami (Ohio) University Athletic

Director Brad Bates, current Uni-
versity of New York at Buffalo Ath-
letic Director Warde Manuel and
current Oregon State University
Athletic Director Bob De Carolis as
potential frontrunners.
"As far as candidates come, you
hear the same three or four names
floating around, but I don't know if
anybody has got an inside track at
this point," Bacon said.
Former Michigan football coach
Lloyd Carr, who stepped down from
coaching in November 2007, has
also been rumored as someone wor-
thy of consideration.
Carr, now 64, has worked in the
Athletic Department since 1980,
when he was hired as the defen-
sive secondary coach under Bo
Schembechler. His coaching career
at Michigan continued until he
resigned from his post as the head
football coach in November 2007.
After stepping down, Carr was
appointed associate athletic direc-
tor, a position he still holds.
While Michigan's head football
coach, Carr led the team to a bowl
game each year, securing five Big
Ten titles and the 1997 National
Championship. Carr was the second
Big Ten coach to ever have an unde-
feated season within three years of
becoming head coach. Over his time
as head coach, the team had a122-40
record overall.
For his leadership, Carr has been
awarded several honors, including
the Walter Camp Football Founda-
tion, American Football Coaches
Association, Football News, Max-
well Football Club, Woody Hayes
and Paul 'Bear' Bryant coach of the
year awards.
Carrtold AnnArbor.comhewould
not accept the position, if offered,
though a statement released yester-
day about Martin's retirement, did
not address whether he would be
interested in the job.
"In 2000 when Bill Martin
became the athletic director at

Michigan, we were well behind our
peers from a facilities standpoint.
Today, we are at the forefront and
the monumental changes that Bill
and his team have orchestrated
have positioned Michigan Athletics
in excellent position for decades to
come," Carr wrote. "I join the many
in expressing our appreciation and
gratitude."
The other rumored frontrunners
to succeed Martin - Bates, Manuel
and De Carolis - all have ties to
the University of Michigan, though
none as deep as Carr's.
Bates, who has served as the
athletic director at Miami (Ohio)
University since 2002, earned his
bachelor's and master's degree
from Michigan. Though he has not
worked for the Michigan's Ath-
letic Department, he was a walk-on
defensive back for Michigan from
1977 to 1981. He also worked as a
strength coach, assistant athletic
director, associate athletic director
and senior associate athletic direc-
tor at Vanderbilt University, before
assuming his position at Miami.
Manuel, a Michigan alum and
former football player under Bo
Schembechler, also has experience
in Michigan's Athletic Department.
Prior to signing on as the Univer-
sity of New York at Buffalo's athletic
director, he worked as an associate
athletic director at Michigan, where
he worked with the men's basketball
and football programs. Manual also
led a fundraising campaign in which
he raised millions for the Student-
Athlete Academic Center..
De Carolis spent 19 years on staff
at Michigan, where he served in
several positions, including softball
coach, associate athletic director
and senior director for financial
operations. He has been the athletic
director at Oregon State Univer-
sity since 2002. During his time at
Oregon State, he has eliminated an

ics.

Rodriguez said. "And that's natural,
because of, not just fundraising and
facility-raising and friend-raising
and the fiscal aspects of it, but the

departments and in sports."
Michigan Baseball Coach Rich
Maloney said Martin's replacement
should be someone with strong
communicationskills, a deep under-
standing of the changing operations
of the NCAA and exceptional fore-
sight.
"We want somebody who would
want to continue building on the
great traditions that we have in the
athletic program in the university,"
Maloney said. "But in everything
that we do, a person of integrity
would be first and foremost."
"We're losing a strong leader
and we need to hire somebody
who is going to develop a deep love
for Michigan," Maloney added.
"That's going to be very important
that somebody (is hired) who real-
ly understands this culture here
because it's a deep, deep love that
coaches have for their institution
and the program so we want to have
every opportunity of continuing the
great traditions that we have."

TEXTING
From Page 1A
from University alum Tim Bek-
kers, who proposed a text messag-
ing plan to McGee last spring.
Bekkers, who was an LSA
senior at the time of the proposal,
argued that if DPS could send text
messages to students, then why
couldn't that line of communica-
tion be opened up on both ends,
allowing students to send mes-

sages to DPS.
Bekkers said there are two
instances where reporting a crime
through text message would be
more useful than calling in.
"This is particularly important
in cases where you don't want to
give away your location, because
text messaging is silent," Bekkers
said. "Imagine either witnessinga
normal crime you'd like to report,
or one infinitely worse, like, God
forbid, a Virginia Tech situation.
You should be able to report a

crime without giving up your own
personal safety."
Bekkers also noted that the new
service would allow students with
hearing or speaking disabilities to
communicate with DPS for help.
"Most deaf and hard-of-hear-
ing students carry cell phones
to text message with people," he
said. "Now they can easily com-
municate with DPS, too."
Currently, there are only a cou-
ple of other locations across the
United States that have a text mes-

saging number to signal for help.
In June 2007, the Boston Police
Department launched a program,
called "Text a Tip," where citi-
zens can anonymously text a tip
about a crime.
However, as with any form of
technology, this system is not
entirely perfect.
One major concern is that the
victim's cell phone provider fails
to properly forward the emergen-
cy message to DPS.
For this reason, there are a

select few carriers in which this
number will not work. Certain
prepaid phones, especially those
through Metro PCS, or phones
without a text messaging plan are
unable to use the system.
Also, the University had to
ensure the carriers understood
the severity of these messages.
"What we understand now,
most uses of those text numbers
have been up to this point for peo-
ple to do more marketing-related
things, not necessarily emergency

messaging," Brownsaid. "An addi-
tional challenge was to have the
providers understand the urgent
nature of these messages." -
Overall, Brown said DPS
expects the new service to have
excellent results, noting that
shortly after it was unofficially
announced at the football game
this past Saturday, someone text-

Blue must play blue-collar
hockey to best Purple Eagles

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Wolverines have played
scrappy teams like Niagara before,
but recent struggles with similar
teams make tonight's matchup

ple Eagles thatN

season ended com/blogs/
with a 2-0 loss She game
to the Falcons in
the first round of the NCAA Tour-
nament. Michigan opened this
season with a 2-0 loss to the Nano-
oks. It was the first time Michigan
had been shut out in back-to-back
games since the 1942-43 season.
"A lot of these teams now, they
play solid defensively," Pearson said.
"They're going to get their breaks on
the power play or catch you in odd-
numbered rushes. They're all the
same. They pack it in defensively
and they don'tgive you much."
"You have to keep it simple and
at the same time get pucks and
players to the net. Don't look for
the cute, fancy, sexy goals."
The Wolverines couldn't con-
vert on their few chances a couple
weeks ago against the Nanooks in
Alaska. Playing simply is easy to
say, but it's another thing to go out
and actually play with poise.
Both Nanook goals came off of
Michigan mistakes, and Alaska-
Fairbanks tightened its defense
after taking the lead. If Michigan
turns the puck over tonight, it will
play right into Niagara's hands,
just as it did for the Nanooks.
"I think we have to get the puck
behind their D, get them moving,
make their D skate," junior for-
ward Louie Caporusso said. "Use
our speed to our advantage. And

use our puck skills to our advan-
tage. I think we have a bunch of
guys on this team that can really
control the puck and have great
hands."
During the past few seasons,
the Niagara has been notorious
for giving Michigan tough games.
Last year, the Wolverines won 4-2
in a tight contest. Two years ago,
Michigan won 5-1 over Niagara in
the first round of the NCAA Tour-
nament, but Hobey Baker Award
winner Kevin Porter scored four
goals.
"We expect a physical game,"
senior captain Chris Summers
said. "They're kinda known for

being a blue collar team, (and)
being a team that bangs bodies
out there ... We're going to have to
come out and play our style hockey
and take it right to them."
Blue-collar hockey is tough and
hard-hitting, but Michigan hasn't
played a game since Oct. 10. Beren-
son acknowledged that the team
could be rusty and needs a fast
start tonight.
"We have to play Michigan
hockey," Berensonsaid. "Andwhen
I say Michigan hockey, we have to
be rock solid defensively. We have
to force turnovers. Through good
forechecking, and winning more
than 50 percent of faceoffs, we

(can) get the puck. And then we
got to get the puck to the net and
put them on their heels when we
get the puck."
Summers said the team is
excited to get its home sched-
ule started. Berenson is 21-1-3 in
home openers during his coaching
career at Michigan, and the team
seems ready to avenge its poor play
against both the Nanooks and Air
Force.
"We got to work just as hard
as them," Caporusso said. "When
you're playing a big school like
ours, you can get revved up for it.
But I think we're goingto be revved
up for Niagara too, though."

A WEEK IN THE
LIFE OF THE
UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN
MARCHING
BAND
BY CAROLYN KLARECKI
DAILY TV/NEW MEDIA EDITOR

ou see them every Football Saturday.
The Big House erupts when they take
the field. They perform as a flawless
unit in which all individuals are constantly
aware of where they are on the field, what
their next move is and everything that's
happening around them. They practice
daily even in the harshest weather and
undergo extensive training. They are some
of the University's most talented students.
And no, they're not on the football team.
The Michigan Marching Band has been a
crucial part of the University's fabric since
1896, and for many football fans, the band
is just as important to the Big House expe-
rience as the game. The band is collected,
cohesive and professional when we see it on
the field. But we all know that the complex
halftime shows don't just happen with the
wave of the drum major's baton. What goes
into producing a new show each week? And
how is the band so damn good? It all rests on
the effort and dedication of its members.
Anyone who lives south of Hill Street has
probablyheard the MarchingBandbrazenly
practicing every day. And anyone near Elbel
Field at 4:45 p.m. on a weekday will hear the
sound of drums pounding in unison while
brassy scales grow louder and louder over
thumping rhythms. Practice begins each
day with a half hour of music rehearsal.
The band members usually receive their

show music several days before gameday so
they have sufficient time to memorize their
parts.
During last Monday's practice, all 328
students, in the Marching Band stood in
arched rows around the 50-yard line. The
musicians stood attentively, watching the
conductor for his signal. Band members
brought their instruments to their lips in
perfect unison to play a new song togeth-
er for the first time. At first, the resulting
music was good, but nothing spectacular.
But by only the third run through, it sound-
ed almost perfect.
The music for the band's last show - an
opera-themed routine for the Delaware
State game - was musically intricate, and
luckily the band had an unusually large
amount of time (two weeks, instead of the
typical one) to prepare for it. Even still,
every show has to be memorized and per-
formed while the band is in motion, adding
a certain amount of difficulty to the perfor-
mances. Because of this added performa-
tive dimension, band members must have
a great amount of dedication to learn the
music off of the field so they can perform
their choreographed parts well when they
take the field.
"(The students) are just so motivated to
be in this band - they're just so positive
about the energy they bring every day,"

said Scott Boerma, Director of Michigan
Marching and Athletic Bands. "They bring
the commitment to excellence; they bring
the understanding of the tradition of this
band that goes back to over a hundred years
of tradition."
"They're carrying on a legacy that came
before them and they understand that and
they take it very seriously," he added.
Music is only half of what marching band
is about. Drill - the actual marching and
formations displayed on the field - takes up
the rest of the practice. Between drill sets,
the marching band looks like any other
bunch of kids decked out in mostly maize
and blue hoodies and sweatpants. They just
happen to be carrying around trombones
and saxophones. Once they hear the drum
major's whistle, however, the band mem-
bers chant in unison, raise their instru-
ments and become a single, unified entity.
The 275 members that march the half-
time show trace the same path and play the
same measures over and over until the for-
mation exactly mirrors what was mapped
out on paper. Graduate students and other
students in leadership positions walk the
practice field and correct those who are out
of line while faculty members stand at the
top of a tower overseeing the field and occa-
sionally yelling out directions and remind-

A notable Ann Arborite gives five
answers to a curious question.
Colleen Seifert
Professor, DepartmentofPsychology
What are your favorite mind-trip films?
1. "The Sixth Sense" (1999): I still remember the wonderful sense of awe
inspired by the moment of realization when the movie finally reveals its secret.
The fun is, can you get there first? Perfect for Halloween!
2. "Memento" (2000): The best movie about memory ever made. Its layer-
ing of past and present remains intriguing in multiple viewings. It even inspired
a famous scientist to renounce his theory of human cognition because it could
never account forthe memory disorder depicted here. Unfortunately for him, this
is a fictional case.
3. "Betrayal" (1983): Again with the precise reverse chronological ordering
of complex interpersonal events! The psychologist in me loves tracing the ante-
cedents of our beliefs and behavior, way back to the most unintentional interac-
tions.
4."Le retour de Martin Guerre" (1982): Your identity is a core psychological
question; but not that long ago, you could simply leave town and assume another
one. What if someone assumed yours, and your spouse, friends and family liked
them better?
5. "The Crying Game" (1992): This movie was ruined for me by another
psychologist at a happy hour. He tried to obliquely refer to its twist as, "You see
something somewhere you would never expect." If this does not give it away for
you too, then see this movie.
SINGLE REVIEW
LOS CAMPESINOS!
"THE SEA IS A GOOD PLACE TO THINK OF THE FUTURE"
Picture a bunch of angsty, Ray-Ban-wearing youths staring pensively at the sea
contemplating life. This ridiculously melodramatic image sums up the latest Los
Campesinos! track. With a slow buildup of smashing cymbals and climactic key-
boards, the song has a surprisingly mature instrumental quality that makes up for
weepy, self-pitying lyrics like "And all you can hear is the sound of your own heart."
Teens on both sides of the pond will be locking their bedroom doors, turning the
track up full blast and drowning their bogus sorrows while older listeners will find
it a guilty, nostalgic pleasure.

a

Toxic drinking is an epidemic on
campuses all across America.
It means consuming so much alcohol
the drinker passes out. But while "sleeping
it off," the victim may be quietly dying.
When you come right down to it, students
themselves are the best ones to tackle
this problem. So, in growing numbers,
Stony Brook students have joined together
in the Red Watch Band movement.
Working with experts, they fine-tuned a
course in techniques to handle these
alcohol emergencies. Red Watch Band
members can act fast, when every second
counts.They know the quick steps they
can take to rescue a passed-out student
from a drinking death, and can immediately
summon professional help. Everyone
completing the course is given the
distinctive red watch for identification.
Since its inception at Stony Brook
University in March 2009, approximately
40 schools across the country have signed
on to implement this lifesaving program.

Ann Arbor's little
slice ofItaly

Ann Arbor, let's talk pizza.
In our college town, it's
often mass-produced,
made on the fly for the phalanxes
of students curled around corners
at the usual
hot spots,
namely Back-
room, Bell's,
Cottage Inn,
NYPD and y
Pizza House. A
sample of the
crowd knock- TKA
ing back beers KAICK
at Charley's
surely would agree that noth-
ing satisfies a case of late-night
munchies like agreasy, cheesy, $1
slice from across the street. I can't
argue with my college brethren's
choice of midnight snack. Late
night pizza is the greatest.
The demand for the product is
high, the customer is willing and
hunger is on the line, literally.
Eating cheap, slapdash slices at
campus haunts is clearly a must-do
college experience and Ann Arbor
has plenty of options. But more
often than not the crusts are bland,
the sauce weak, the cheese qual-
ity poor and the topping selection
sparse.
These low standards make a
smatteringof chili flakes, extra
parmesan and a big gulp of soda
(yes, "soda" - not "pop") almost a
necessity in the quest to get it all
down successfullybefore heading
to the next party or back home
to the comfortable recesses of
your sheets. It's safe to say that
most Michigan students don't
seek out pizza places open past 11
p.m. for the sake of their sensitive
taste buds. But if we did, there is
no question: In terms of quality,
the cheese stands alone. Silvio's
Organic Pizza surpasses the com-
petition.
Silvio's commitment to locally
bought fresh ingredients and
innovative flavor combinations
yields a superior slice - one that
a surprisingly large number of
Ann Arborites have yet to try.
What's more, Silvio's - like its
endemically greasy, hyper-cheesy
counterparts - is also open late:
untif 3 a.i onFridy End T iida
nights. That's worth noting, espe-
cially if you find yourself around
North University Avenue in need
of a snack at 2 a.m. Silvio's location
also makes it the perfect lunch
spot, a stone's throw from the Diag
and a welcome Mom-and-Pop
alternative to the Panera, Chipotle,
Noodles & Company and Star-
bucks that surround it.
The restaurant itself, with its
gray-tiled floor, red tabletops, Ital-
ian flags and children's colored
pencil drawings hanging on the
cream-colored and exposed-brick
walls is reminiscent oftheboard-
walk eateries I used to go to with
family duringsummer vacations at
the beach. Those memories and the

soft yellow lighting inspire warm
fuzzy feelings, only furthered by
the glorious smells radiating from
the industrial-sized oven.
The neatest parts of the whole
experience, besides the vintage
stain-glass Coca-Cola clock and
the fact that the restaurant is raf-
fling off two round-trip tickets to
Italy, is the experiments taking
place in that kitchen. At Silvio's
you'll find ingredient combinations
you've never even imagined. Try a
potato, blue cheese and rosemary
pizza, or maybe a bowl of dande-
lion soup. The most popular of
these crazy creations is the truffle
pizza - fontina cheese, shitake
mushrooms and white truffle oil.
Hold the tomato sauce - this thing
is out of this world. Other quirky
finds include breakfast pizza and
the "Sweet Dream" pizza, a super
alternative to insomnia cook-
ies, topped with custard cream,
Nutella and powdered sugar. If
you desire somethingasweet, but
less colossal than a whole pizza,
you'd be a fool to pass up the can-
nolis - tube-shaped shells of fried
pastry dough with a sweet vanilla
or chocolate custard filling.
Silvio's creations may seem
unorthodoxbut they're almost
always a success. It's refreshing to
see such a commitment to innova-
At Silvio's,
organic doesn't
mean orthodox.
tion, especially in a market that
usually restricts itself to the basics:
cheese, pepperoni and ... more
cheese. Moreover, Silvio's is com-
mitted to producing a healthy meal
for its patrons. Every pizza is pat-
ted out by hand, made with organ-
ic ingredients and produced using
sustainable food practices. Silvio
Medoro and family, who work and
run the restaurant, buy their certi-,
fied organic ingredients from local
providers. You may even recognize
the tastetihe r g theese .e t
from another Ann Arbor favorite:
Zingerman's.
If the perfection of the crust,
succulent flavor collaborations and
extensive menu are not enough
to draw you to Silvio's, try a piece
for the authenticity of the flavors.
They're as genuine as any I tried
on my trip to Italy because Silvio
and his family are actually from
Italy. Always, always, always ask
about the special, and if you can't
make it out of bed, call in. They
deliver!

Cult with personality

At the State Theater, 'Rocky
Horror' continues its long
run as a midnight staple
By ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Film Editor
Seeing "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"
in the privacy of your own home is a bizarre
experience, and it leaves you baffled. Taken on
its own merits, the film is
a sexually charged Fran-
kenstein's Monster stitched T
together from various pop- Horror
culture elements: B-movie Picture Show
horror, jukebox musical and
circus sideshow. The plot is Tomorrow
some nonsense about a mad and Saturday
scientist named Dr. Frank- at midnight
N-Furter (Tim Curry) who At the State Theater
corrupts the sexuality of a
young engaged couple while
building his own Speedo-clad sex slave. The
film is still fun for those unfamiliar, but almost
incomprehensibly so.
As "Rocky" fans might say, though, it's the
midnight screenings that really drive you insa-
a-a-ayne.
"I actually saw the movie for the first time
before a midnight showing, and I was like, 'This
is a weird movie,' " recalls Charlotte Raines, a
School of Music, Theater & Dance junior. "And
my friend was like, 'No Charlotte, you have to go
to a midnight showing. It will change your life."'
Raines attended her first midnight showing
in her senior year of high school. Since then, she
has attended many more in New York, Jackson
and Ann Arbor, and she also played a Phan-
tom (a member of the ensemble) in MUSKET's
2007 production of the original Broadway stage
play. Such is the transformative power of seeing
"Rocky Horror" with the right audience.
Simply put, a midnight screening of "The
Rocky Horror Picture Show" is unlike anything
else in popular culture. It lies somewhere in the
intersection between film, live musical theater,
burlesque show and food fight. The film, which
flopped during its initial release in 1975, has
gained eternal life in the decades since thanks
to a freakishly devoted global fan base. The
elaborate spectacles staged around the midnight
screenings have transformed "Rocky Horror"
into arguably the biggest cult film of all time.
The State Theater knows how to cultivate
Ann Arbor's population of "Rocky" fanatics,
and tomorrow and Saturday it will continue the
long-standing tradition of the midnight screen-
ings, scheduled as usual just before Halloween.
This year the theater will be upping the ante by
hiring Tickled Fancy Burlesque Company for
the event.
"We were trying to think of ways to make
midnight movies a bigger production," said
Christine Tremblay, assistant manager of the
State Theater.
For the past couple of years the theater has
brought in Dynamic Tension, Inc., a performance
troupe that specializes in "Rocky Horror," but
this year it decided to mix things up a bit.
If you're a "Rocky Horror" virgin - some,

one wh 's never attended a midnight screening
before - you're probably asking why it's neces-
sary to even hire a performance group in the
first place. After all, it's just a movie, right?
Wrong. There are actually three components
to the midnight showings that don't involve the
movie actually playing on the screen. The first
of these components is a "shadow cast," a group
that acts out musical numbers and other scenes
from the film in front of the screen while it plays
behind them.
"It's like a live show and a movie at the same
time," explained Raines, who will be helping out
with production aspects of this year's shadow
cast.
The cast doesn't do anything halfway: It fully
commits itself to the roles, using props and dress-
ing up in the appropriate costumes, which more
often than not involve drag, heavy makeup and
fishnet stockings. The shadow cast also usu-
ally performs a pre-show, which could incorpo-
rate anything from the "Thriller" dance to the
"deflowering" of the virgins in the audience (see-.
ing who can make the best orgasm noises, etc.).
Secondly, there are the "callbacks" - words
and phrases that the audience is primed to yell
at the screen duringcertain moments. Although
the exactcallbacks vary between locations,some
are universal. Yelling "Asshole!" at the character
of Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) and "Slut!" at
Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon), for example, are
standard procedures. The callbacks help to unite
the community in the theater and transform the
proceedings into a much more participatory
experience. Everyone knows what to say and at

what times.
Jeffrey Zebrowski, a fifth-year Residential
College senior and "Rocky Horror" devotee,
remembers how he had read an audience partic-
ipation script for the film online before attend-
ing his first midnight screening so he wouldn't
be left in the dark. He didn't want to stand out
. as a virgin, because it's easy for the audience to
hone in on those not participating. Zebrowski
admits that he'll target virgins at the screenings,
as well.
The third component at the midnight show-
ings is the use of props. At many of the perfor-
mances, audience members will bring objects to
the theater that are then thrown at key moments
in the film: rice during the opening wedding
scene, toast when one of the characters proposes
a toast, toilet paper when Brad exclaims, "Great
Scott!" and much more. in recent years, includ-
ing this year, the State Theater has banned the
use of props to help with the cleanup process,
much to the annoyance of "Rocky" fans.
Still, Zebrowski can understand why it was
necessary to stop the props.
"When people get water thrown on them,
when they get rice thrown on them., (the theater
managers) aren't too thrilled," he said with a
laugh.
But props or no props, the legacy of "Rocky
Horror" will live on for a long time, and this
Friday and Saturday all of the cult's members
will once again do the "The Time Warp" in the
aisles of the State Theater.:Buy your $8 ticket in
advance, because they'll sell out. Fishnet stock-
ings optional - but encouraged.

MARCHING BAND
From Page 1B
ers to individuals.
Despite the hard work everyone puts
into the Marching Band, no one seems
to grow sick of it. Revelli Hall (the band's
headquarters) is usually full of students
practicing their flag choreography, run-
ning through music with their sections or
just socializing with other band members
hours before practice begins.
Last Thursday, the band rehearsed
in rainy, 30-degree weather. Even when
people's breaths were visible and their
toes were growing numb, a couple mem-
bers confidently shed their shirts and
rehearsed the pre-game routine with
smiles on their faces. Perhaps it wasn't
the safest display of band enthusiasm, but
it was surely indicative of how much the
students are willing to go through for the
band. What makes this stressful environ-
ment enjoyable is the sense of camarade-
rie and intra-section spirit.
"My favorite part has to be the people,"
said LSA senior and trumpet rank leader
Michael Rudowski. "Coming in as a fresh-
man to the University ... you have a com-
munity of 300 people (in the band) ... and,
being a trumpet, I have a really large sec-
tion of 62 members - that's how large my
high school band was. I don't think social-
ly, college would've played out the same
way if I wasn't a member of the band from
day one."
Community and tradition are impor-
tant to the band - the trumpet section
makes a point of practicing for the band's
weekly touch football tournament before
rehearsal; the euphonium players have
a tradition of dressing up in accordance
with the theme of that week's show (last
Friday, they dressed as characters from
the four operas presented in the halftime

performance).
After each practice the band huddles
together for announcements. Some are
important, like reminders about Basket-
ball Band. Others, including epic declara-
tions of band members' birthdays and the
resulting number of cheers correspond-
ing with years of age, just add to the fun.
Before leaving the field, the band sings in
support of defeating the football team's
upcoming opponent and plays one final
round of "The Victors."
"('The Victors') is an iconic fight song -
the best fight song in the country, in the
world, no matter what anyone says," said
Drum Major David Hines Jr. "The first
time I heard myself on a recorded play of
"The Victors" - there's nothing else like
that. It's definitely something special."
The band members have an indescrib-
able amount of spirit. And not just toward
marching band. Their enthusiasm toward
Michigan football is tangible.
In the tunnel before the Delaware
State game, cheers of support and shouts
of good luck between the band, the foot-
ball team, the cheerleaders and the dance
team echo deafeningly, mixing to create
an unmatchable air of enthusiasm.
"We're all there to support the team
and generate excitement in the stadium,"
Boerma said.
The community surrounding the
Marching Band doesn't just extend to
band members and other football-centric
-student teams. Despite the low tempera-
tures on Friday evening and Saturday
morning, the band's last few practices
attracted quite a crowd. Ranging in ages
from eight months to 80 years, people
bundled up in Michigan regalia came out
to support the band. Some visitors came to
watch sons or daughters and others came
to support friends. And all had nothing
but respect for the marching band.
With such a diverse audience. the band

has the responsibility and opportunity to
provide music that appeals to all specta-
tors.
"The hardest thing about what we do
is the fact that we have 110,000 people all
with different preferences of what they'd
like to hear, so we try to appeal to every-
body at some point in the season," Boerma
said. "It's just a process of trying to find a
good balance to connect with everybody
at some point."
Approximately 110,000 people eager-
ly await the band's entrance in the Big
Mouse before kickoff of every home game,
but for band members, the Saturday fes-
tivities start much earlier. For the noon
game against Delaware State, the Sat-
urday Marching Band practice began
promptly at 7:30 a.m. While even the most
dedicated pre-gamers were still in bed,
328 students were up and preparing for a
busy day, watching the sun rise over Elbel
Field in 25-degree weather. About two
hours later, after final run-throughs of
music and marching, the practice ended
and band members dispersed to tailgate,
eat breakfast with members of Delaware
State's band and de-thaw.
The drum line, considered by many to
be the centerpiece of the Marching Band,
reconvened for its weekly pre-game step
show outside of Revelli Hall at 10:30 a.m.
The waiting audience was treated to the
drum line's impressive rhythms - it was
difficult to spot anyone in the crowd
who wasn't completely captivated by the
beat. The informal concert ended with
a musically and visually complex piece:
Drummers placed their drums on stands
and struck them as the performers spun
around and wove between one another.

The band cheered with wild excite-
ment as the Michigan football team came
in from the field. The two groups joined
in the tunnel, and immediately the band
transformed into a stoic, professional
militia at the sight of the Delaware State
team. Before marching onto the field, the
band huddled together, arms across each
other's shoulders, to sing "The Yellow
and Blue."
"I like a lot of things about band week,"
Hines Jr. said, "but you practice every
week just leading up to the game."
Being a part of the Marching Band also
provides many students with once-in-a-

over our flight plans ... They sent three
quarters of the band home from Pasadena
hours after the game ended," Rudowski
recalled. "We played 'The Victors' very
slowly as they were processing the coffin
by ... It was very powerful."
Through its activities outside of Satur-
day performances, it's easy to see that the
Marching Band is made of much more
than uniforms and music. The halftime
shows students see on the field are the
products of 328 students' devotion for
music and marching, and the end result
of hours of physical and mental sacrifice
- though no member would call it one.
This loyalty has fostered a unique family
on campus.
"It's the students that make this band;
the students that bring the drive and the
talent and the smarts and the desire to
be excellent," Boerma said. "And without
that drive, without that internal commit-
ment to making this program great, none
of us could've made this happen."

By KAVI PANDEY
Daily Arts Writer
For children sauntering through
the aisles of the video store peek-
ing at R-rated movies they would
have to wait an eternity to see, one
film in particular likely sends chills
down their prepubescent spines:
"Candyman."
The title's promise of delectable,
pleasant mirth is immediately shat-
tered by the film cover's terrifying
visual of a blood-red eye with a
menacing, man-shaped shadow for
a pupil and a solitary bee sitting on
the eyelid. The tagline is equally
horrific - "We dare you to say his
name five times!" - as it creates an
insatiable desireto test the declara-
tion while dreading the potential
consequences.
In the film, repeating the phrase
causes the Candyman (Tony Todd,
TV's,"Chuck") to appear immedi-
ately behind the summoner, and he
proceeds to hook the person and
anybody in the vicinity from"groin
to gullet." But this isn't just another
slasher film with the villain cutting
up an endless supply of silly teens
who dare test the myth. Instead,
"Candyman" serves as an intelli-
gent psychological thriller, exam-
ining the impact of an urban legend
on the public and individual psyche,
while providing enough shocks and
chills to be sincerely scary.
The film's lead, Helen Lyle
(Virginia Madsen, "Sideways"),
happens to be a graduate student
researching urban legends, spe-
cifically the story of the Candyman.
Helen uncovers that residents of a
crime-infested, low-income hous-
ing project are connecting a series
of gruesome deaths to the myth
of the Candyman, who is said to
reside in the city. Here, in the der-
elict, graffiti-strewn buildings of
the project, complete with bark-
ing pit bulls and threatening gang
members, Helen begins her inves-
tigation. Does the Candyman actu-
ally exist or are criminals merely
exploiting the legend to terrorize
the community?
The answer remains intention-
ally ambiguous throughout the
film. Even when Helen foolishly
summons the Candyman and he
begins to slay her acquaintances, it
is never clear if the murders are the

doings of this wraith-like figure or,
even more outlandishly, if Helen is
committing them herselfin a mani-
acal trance.
On screen, it appears as though
the Candyman is cutting through
the victims, but these may just be
images formulated by her mind.
After all,behind her tough exterior,
Helen has a very vulnerable mind,
constantly questioning her hus-
band's fidelity. The movie suggests
that such a frail mind is susceptible
to manipulation - perhaps Helen's
subconsciousis absorbingtheurban
legend and using it as an excuse to
expel frustrations by murdering
people. Then again, much of the
dismemberment in the film would
require alot of strength, thus mak-
When childhood
fears come true,
ing it equally likelythat the illusory
Candyman is the true culprit.
The Candyman stands alongside
some of the horror genre's greatest
menaces, yet he is distinct in his
approach and appearance. Unlike
Jason Voorhees of "Friday the
13th" fame and countless other vil-
lains, the Candyman doesn't hide
behind a mask. His intense visage
is revealed to the viewer, allowing
for a hint of humanity in what is
normally a soulless character. The
wise, brooding figure is surpris-
ingly insightful, making fascinat-
ing proclamations about the power
of his legend.
Those concerned that "Candy-
man" might.be overtly philosophi-
cal need not worry - the film
contains all the elements of a classic
horror thrill ride. It is consistently
suspenseful because of its dimly lit
scenes,sharpeditingandharrowing
Philip Glass score. A swarm of bees
fills the revolting creature quota,
and there is a satisfying but not
excessive number of gruesome-yet-
awesome deaths. Because of this,
"Candyman" works on multiple lev-
els. The film's deeper subtext can be
ignoredby those seeking a diversion
or adopted by those searching for a
little"more"fromtheirhorrorfilms.
Either way, "Candyman" is amemo-
rable frightener.

HOGAN
From page 4C
Michigan's starting goalten-
der.
After surrendering seven
goals to North Dakota in the
first round of the 2007 NCAA
Tournament, Sauer allowed
three goals in the first period of
Michigan's Frozen Four game
against Notre Dame. Berenson
pulled Sauer after the terrible
first period. Hogan, a fresh-
man at the time, took his place
between the pipes in the do-
or-die playoff game, allowing
only one goal in overtime and
one in regulation, but it wasn't
enough. Sauer's poor perfor-
mance doomed the Wolverines
with a 5-4 overtime loss.
"The reason (the goalie bat-
tle) came about was because
Billy Sauer's playoff record
was really not that strong in
his first year or two," Berenson
said. "For our team to be the
team we want, we're going to
have to have more competitive
goaltending."
The two had very little in
common as goalies. Blackburn,
now Michigan's goalie coach,
describes Sauer as "laid back"
both off the ice and on. But
his playoff collapses showed
that Sauer was more prone to
hot and cold performances.

Conversely, Hogan was even-
keeled between the pipes, sus-
taining focus through most
games, despite his hot-headed
practice demeanor.
Hogan maintains that the
two had a healthy position bat-
tle, but he'll be the first to say
that the two weren't the best
of friends.
"It is like every other goal-
ie competition," Hogan said.
"You're both fighting for a
position, but you don't want to
get too close."
According to Hogan, the
competition strengthened his
game mentally and improved
his focus on the ice.
And on a team like Michi-
gan, a goaltender's focus often
becomes the deciding factor in
close games.
Michigan's defense shut
down the Falcons' offense in
the Wolverines' first-round
NCAA Tournament loss last
season. But the two goals that
slipped past Hogan came on
great scoring opportunities
after he had stood in net for
several minutes straight with-
out seeing any action.
Such a shot imbalance forc-
es goaltenders to be on their
toes at all times, which takes a
great deal of concentration for
any college-level netminder.
"The type of game that
Michigan plays is a mental

challenge for any of the goal-
ies that play here," said Scar-
pace, who is now the team's
video coordinator. "It's not
like you're getting a lot of shots
every night. You're getting
underworked, so it's a men-
tal challenge to stay in games
and make the saves you have to
make. You have to be ready to
make a difference. "
And after going with a two-
goalie system for much of the
first half of last season, Beren-
son decided to start the goal-
tender he felt would deal best
with that mental challenge.
Blackburn says it was only
so long before Berenson made
it clear that the Wolverines
would be a one-goalie team.
"It was two guys fight-
ing for a No. 1 spot to play all
the games," Blackburn said.
"Sooner or later, we were going
to choose one guy ... Every
time Hogie touched the ice, he
won. And when Billy played,
we didn't win. Just wins made
the decision for us."
So Hogan took to the ice
with the tentative No. 1 tag
and Sauer still pushing the
sophomore for playing time.
With the slightest mistake and
Hogan knew that his starting
job between the pipes could be
taken away.
"Every game, I was look-
ing over my shoulder," Hogan
said. "There was even
games when I didn't
let many goals in and
we weren't playing the
best team, but I may
not have played well.
I'm always second
guessing myself, but
I think that's good. It
keeps me always on my
toes."

"We're getting better from
last year," Burlon said. "You
saw last year how we went
down with three injuries to
defensemen, including myself,
and I think we still held our
own. Having everyone back
and healthy this year, we're
going to be that much better."
The six returning defense-
men each played in at least
25 games last year, even with
the abundance of injuries.
Five of those six - Summers,
Burlon, senior Steve Kampfer
and juniors Chad Langlais and.
Ttistin Llewellyn - figure to
play in every game. The sixth,
Pateryn, will battle for the
final spot with Moffie.
And that isn't a knock on
Pateryn. Rather, it's a testa-
ment to the team's great depth
and Moffie's upside.
"They're probably going to
be fighting along with (senior
Eric) Elmblad for a spot all
year long," Powers said.
"Now, the other five guys
have a little more experience.
But if anybody in that group
starts slipping, we're com-
fortable that with our depth
with Moffie, Pateryn and
Elmblad."
In Michigan's first few
games, defensemen have
joined the rush and forwards
have often looked to open men

on the point on the forecheck.
"The defense jumping up
in the rush and being a part
of the play offensively is a big
deal," Caporusso said. "If the
defensemen aren't a part of
the rush, then it's just three-
on-three down low and you
can't hit that odd guy coming
in."
In the Wolverines' first win
of the season, against Alaska-
Anchorage on Oct. 10, the
blueliners provided five assists
and eight shots on goal in the
6-1 victory.
No defensemen scored, but
the defense's increased offen-
sive role was apparent. For
D-Row, it may be only a matter
of time before pucks start hit-
ting the back of the net.
ROLE PLAY
Even with four of the Wol-
verines' five regular defense-
men capable of putting up a lot
of points, they haven't forgot-
ten to uphold the other long-
standing tradition of D-Row
- keeping the puck out of the
net.
In each of the past two
years, Michigan has been
ranked fourth in the country
in goals against. The Wolver-
ines gave up just 2.05 goals per
game last season.
"There's alot of pride in that
locker room for plus-minus,
for being on the ice for goals
against," Berenson said. "I
know there's defensemen that
are going to be looking at their

points, but they know bottom on your team," Berenson said.

solid defense translates into
a good offense, the increased
role will undoubtedly lead
to increased risk on the back
end.
In an effort to find that
elusive balance between
offense and defense, two-way
talents like Summers have
been paired with more defen-
sive-minded players such as
Llewellyn.
"It's important to have a
cross section of defensemen

"We've got some physical-
ity on defense, we've got some
mobility, we've got some offen-
sive instincts that are going to
help us and they've got some
good defensive instincts as
well."
Looking across D-Row, that
cross section is evident. Lan-
glais at 5-foot-9 is dwarfed by
six inches by Pateryn, whose
locker sits just feet away.
The offensively talented
Langlais will show up on the

stat sheet much more than
Pateryn, but the physical pres-
ence the 210-pound defense-
.man displays on the ice could
be just as important.
"Different guys have differ-
ent roles," Pateryn said. "All
of us know what we need to
do and we're not going to do
things we can't do."
The defensive combina-
tions have changed often in
the early part of the season,
and while this has led to the
camaraderie seen on and off
the ice, the roles for some
have changed.
On opening weekend, the
coaches paired up Burlon and
Langlais, two puck rushing
defensemen. The pair has been
forced to adjust to each other's
offensive prowess and take
fewer risks compared to when
they are paired with a stay-at-
home defensemen.
"We try and contribute in
every aspect of the game,"
Burlon said. "You don't want to
be a one- dimensional player.
If you have to be called upon
to fill a different role, that's
important."
With just one incoming
freshman, the experienced
group knows how to adjust
to changing roles. With the
returnofveteran players comes
both the return of silly off-ice
traditions and the potential for
more on-ice success.
"To me, the team with the
best defense wins," Berenson
said.

:TALE OF THE TAPE

C OAC N EER2- *S*
CCHi.A CO NTENDERS

Notre Dame
The Fighting Irish have some
huge holes to fill. Not only did
they lose their record-setting
goaltender Jordan Pearce, a
CCHA Player of the Year final-
ist, but they also lost last sea-
son's captain and leading scorer
Erik Condra. Freshman Kyle
Palmieri, a first-round pick in
the NHL Draft, will make up
some of the offensive produc-
tion. Palmieri, the MVP of the
U.S. Development Team a year
ago, will join Calle Ridderwall
and Billy Maday to contribute
offensive power for the Fighting
Irish. The biggest question will
be whether or not junior Brad
Phillips can fill the void in net.
Freshman Mike Johnson would
step in if he falters.
STAFF PICKS
The Daily hockey
writers take their best
shot to predict what will
happen in the world
of college hockey
during Michigan's
2009-10 campaign.

Miami (Ohio)
Make no mistake about it:
whatever happens this year, the
memory of a last-minute col-
lapse in the national champion-
ship game last season against
Boston Universitywill hauntthe
RedHawks for years to come.
No. 1 Miami (Ohio) returns
seven of its eight top point-
scorers. It also returns both
freshmen goalies from last
year's Frozen Four run - Con-
nor Knapp and Cody Reichard.
Each tallied over 1,000 minutes
last season and should battle for
the starting gig all year.
If the RedHawks can men-
tally overcome last year's night-
mare, pencil them in as the
frontrunner for a conference
title.

Alaska Fairbanks
Alaska-Fairbanks has a slow,
methodical, and defensive-
oriented system. It clogs the
neutral zone and forces turn-
overs as well as any team in the
league. Alaska's only problem is
its inability to consistently light
the lamp.
Alaska has to replace gradu-
ating senior goalie Chad John-
son, who was a Hobey Baker
Award finalist and CCHA Play-
er of the Year. Sophomore Scott
Greenham took over this season
in goal and shut out Michigan
2-0 in the Wolverines' season
opener.
If Alaska can improve on its
1.90 goals scored per game, it
will have a legitimate chance of
winning the CCHA.

Nebraska - Omaha
With Mike Kemp out after
12 years and Dean Blais in, the
Mavericks now have a head
coach with a pedigree of suc-
cess nationally. Blais took North
Dakota to the Frozen Four as
head coach in 1997 and 2000.
That's great news for a team
with one NCAA Tournament
appearance this decade. The
had news for No. 16 Nebraska-
Omaha is a lack of offensive
punch. But if Nehraska-Omaha
can muster up enough offense
in front of sophomore goalie
John Faulkner against the con-
ference's stout defensive units,
then Nebraska-Omaha is a top-
15 team. If not, then Blais's tour-
nament experience with the
Fighting Sioux won't matter.

Northern Michigan
The biggest change for the
Wildcats this season is that they
are no longer underdogs - they
are a team expected to win.
Northern Michigan is return-
ing four of its top five 'scorers
from its breakout season a year
ago, including Mark Olver and
Erik Gustafsson. The experi-
enced play of senior goalie Brian
Stewart, who was a first-team
all-conference selection, will
be paramount to whether or not
the Wildcats can improve on
last year's third-place finish in
the Mason Cup race.
Northern Michigan has fallen
into a trend of starting slow and
finishing strong. Bucking the
trend would make it a CCHA
contender.

The Michigan hockey defensemen all share a row of lockers deemed "D-ROW" in the Wolverines' dressing room.

Like any other team, the Michigan
hockey team has its unspoken rules -
and this one has become a tradition.
Freshmen defensemen must pay their
dues, whether it's getting the sauna
ready after practice, carrying equip-
ment off the ice, or recycling bottles in
the locker room. But every defenseman,
regardless of year, is responsible for one
job - the have to protect the tape.
This year's lone freshman defender,
Lee Moffie, is entrusted with making
sure the team's forwards don't use the
clear tape. The playful rivalry is just
part of the tradition that contributes
to the great camaraderie of this year's
defensive corps.
"They don't let us use their clear tape
before practice," junior forward Louie
Caporusso said. "I don't know why. I
think it's pretty immature, if you ask
me. They have their own ways of going
about things."
It's a rivalry that lasts. Senior Scoot-
er Vaughan was switched from defense
to offense this season, and he said that
he steals the tape just to frustrate his
former unit.
Keeping the tape away from the for-
wards is just the beginning of the rival-
ry the two units have on and off the
ice. Joking with each other and taking
extra shots at forwards in practice are
little ways the fraternity evokes itself.

The defense hangs out on and off the
ice, on road trips, during team meals.
The group of defenders even has its
own line of lockers in the team's dress-
ing room, which they call "D-Row."
"We went to that after a while,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson said of
the locker configuration. "We like that.
All the defensemen, their conversa-
tions are hopefully about defense. But
they're sitting near the guy they're
playing with."
The consensus among the group is
that this is the best the blue liners have
gotten along in the past four years. And
that camaraderie has already led to
results on the ice.
"Even when you're not talking, the
communicating before and the cama-
raderie really helps if you don't have
the chance to talk and be really blatant
with what you want done," sophomore
defenseman Brandon Burlon said.
"Knowing what the other guy is going
to do makes it a lot easier."
The defense, which includes seven
returning players, will likely be a
strength of ateam that is much younger
on offense.
"All eight defensemen need to be
on the same page at all times," senior
captain Chris Summers said. "It is defi-
nitely a team game, like I've said before.
If we're on the same page and everyone

is working, then everyone's going to be
having fun."
There is no lack of camaraderie
on D-Row, and the tale of the tape is
entrenched as a defensive tradition.
"It might be the most simple thing in
the world to just toss it to (a forward),"
said Burlon, who, along with sopho-
more Greg Pateryn was in charge of
the tape last season. "But you got to just
shake your head and say 'no."
SHADES OF THE PAST
As much as the members of D-Row
pride themselves on their level of cama-
raderie, it's not all about friendship and
togetherness.
That sense of unity off the ice does
separate this defensive group from
many of Berenson's past groups, but so
does the possibility that this could be
one of the best that he has coached.
On paper, that year's this defensive
unit looks like one of the deepest in
Michigan hockey history. All Beren-
son asks for is a balance between sound
defense and offensive contributions
when opportunities present them-
selves.
"That's what we're looking at, ulti-
mately - getting offensive support
from the defensemen and still being
really solid defensively," Berenson said.
"So that's a challenge for the defense-

men. I don't want them getting trapped
up the ice at the expense of hoping to
get the puck on offense and leaving us
outnumbered."
Summers compared this unit to the
team's defense in 2006-07, from his
freshman year. That group featured
current Los Angeles Kings defenseman
Jack Johnson and Boston Bruins defen-
seman Matt Hunwick. But in some
respects, this year's unit is better than
the group that included the eventual
NHL regulars three years ago.
"There is probably better balance
(this season) with four or five guys that
could contribute offensively and score
some goals," Michigan assistant coach
Billy Powers said. "Whereas maybe
that group Summers is talking about,
we had two or three."
The coaching staff's emphasis on
more of an offensive-minded defense
comes after last season's dismal output
from the blue line. Just18 ofthe Wolver-
ines' 145 goals came from defensemen.
That was a major factor in the team's
low power play percentage - 15.8%, a
rate good for sixth in the CCHA.
But with a more concerted focus in
the offensive zone during practice and
another year of experience for a now-
veteran group, the expectations for
defensive production will surely be

Octobcr .22. 21009 - Faceoff 0 5C-

M Tenminutes of overtime had elapsed in the 1998 NCAA Hock-
ey Championship game, and Boston College's leading scorer,
p O Marty Reasoner, charged toward Turco after evading the Mich-
igan defense. He stared straight at the Wolverines' senior goalie,
T Uwho stood calmly between the pipes. Around him stood a rau-
cous home crowd of Boston College faithful, all standing fever-
ishly at Boston's legendary Fleet Center in hopes of conquering
Michigan-the closest thing college hockey had to a dynas-
ty at the time. The Wolverines watched breathlessly from
AL NE the bench as something their head coach, Red Berenson, had
told them at the end of regulation reverberated in their heads.

"DON'T WORRY, WE'VE GOT TURCO."
As Reasoner readied himself for the most
important shot of his career, the winningest
goalie in NCAA history poked the puck out
of Reasoner's control, halting the threat to
the Michigan's second National Champion-
ship in three years.
In overtime, Turco watched an Eagle shot
soar past him and off the crossbar, and heard
another ping loudly off the post. Both were
mere inchesfromdecidingthegame. Butthis
last save meant something more to a scrappy
Michigan team that Berenson knew wasn't
the most talented on the ice that night.
Turco only had to wait eight more min-
utes for his vindication.
Freshman Josh Langfield curled seam-
lessly around the net and surprised an unsus-
pecting Boston College goalie to capture the
Wolverines another national championship.
"That was the feeling that year," Berenson
says today. "We're going to play hard, and we
knew Marty was going to hold the fort."
After his most talented team fell short the
year before, Berenson knew how important
a goalie like Turco was to the team's playoff
run.
"He took us to four Frozen Fours and he
won two of them and he should've won the
third one," Berenson said. "I just can't say
enough about the confidence that a good
goalie gives everyone else."
As Turco skated off the Fleet Center ice
that night, he took with him one of the most
accomplished goaltending resumes in col-
lege hockey history.
A benchmark for Michigan goaltend-
ing was born. And despite the multitude
of capable goalies since Turco, none have
matched his playoff savvy.
"We just felt like he was invincible,"
Berenson said.
Josh Blackburn, the Wolverines' goalie
from 1998 to 2002, aided in two Frozen Four
runs but came home empty-handed on both
occasions.
Al Montoya, Michigan most touted goalie
recruit since Turco, allowed four straight
goals to Colorado College in 2005 and sur-
rendered a 3-0 lead as the team's national
championship hopes slipped away.
After Montoya, the Wolverines were
made victims of epic playoff goaltendingcol-
lapses from Noah Ruden (five goals to North
Dakota in 2006) and Billy Sauer (10 goals in
two postseason losses).

Eleven years after the 1998 Championship
game, Turco's shadow still looms over the
Michigan goalie position. Since then, near-
ly ever season of excellent goaltending has
been tarnished by poor postseason showings
between the pipes.
Last year, current Michigan goaltender
Bryan Hogan filed onto the ice inBridgeport,
Conn. to take on an overmatched Air Force
team. Despite seeing just 13 shots, his low-
est total in a Michigan uniform, the junior
allowed two goals as Air Force upset the
Wolverines, 2-0.
"At any position you're in, you feel like
you've let yourself down or your team down
when you lose a game like that," Hogan said.
This year, with new hopes of a national
championship, Berenson knows that Hogan
will be one of the main pieces if Michigan is
destined to break its 11-year title drought.
"Somebody told me a long time ago, when
you get to this tournament, the team with
the best goalie wins," Berenson said after the
loss to Air Force.
It's just a question of whether Hogan is
ready to be the first Michigan goalie to step
out of Turco's championship shadow.
COMPETITIVE FIRE
At 10 years old, Bryan Hogan was already
prepared for the intensity of college hockey.
The only problem was that he was still
just a Novi Ice Cat.
Hogan remembers one specific video of
his Pee-Wee hockey days that epitomized the
Highland Township native's young tenacity.
"I had gotten scored on ... and, I swear
to God, I went nuts, I hit the post, I almost
hit the referee with my stick," Hogan said.
"Growing up, I had a problem with getting
so angry when I leta goal in ... I was nuts."
And it wasn't just duringgames. L.J. Scar-
pace, a former Michigan goalie and Hogan's
hockey coach with the USA Eagles, recalls
multiple occasions when Hogan would "have
a word with his teammates" when they
scored on him or took a shot he didn't like.
"You could see him get so intense and
emotional," Scarpace said. "As a 10- or
11-year-old, that's not something you usually
see that young."
That intensity was a driving force for
Hogan, who took his persona to Detroit Cath-
olic Central High School where he won an
MHSAA State championship in 2005. From
there, as a little-known prospect, Hogan

found his way onto the roster of the USHL's
Lincoln Stars and wrestled the starting job
away from Michigan commit Steve Jakiel
halfway through his rookie season.
Hogan wasn't expected to steal the posi-
tion so quickly, but after four wins in the
playoffs, he kept the job through the next
year. That was enough for Berenson and the
Michigan staff, who extended a scholarship
offer to the Lincoln goalie in the offseason.
A year later when Hogan made his way to
Ann Arbor, Jakiel saw the writing on the
wall and transferred, leaving Hogan as the
only capable goaltender behind junior Billy
Sauer.
Soon after coming to Ann Arbor, Hogan's
fiery reputation resurfaced.
Often times when he is scored on in prac-
tice, Hogan slams his stick'down or sends
curses echoing throughout Yost Ice Arena.
Junior backup goalie Shawn Hunwick said
his favorite form of Hogan's episodes are
when he shoots the puckback at players who
have scored on him, even if the puck almost
always misses its target.
"It's just to send a message back to them,"
Hunwick said. " 'Next time, you're not going
to beat me.' "
Although the team routinely pesters
Hogan for his behavior during practice,
senior captain Chris Summers knows that
the junior goaltender's tenacity is his great-
est contribution to the Wolverines.
"All goalies are out of their minds," Sum-
mers said. "And he's the most passionate
about his position compared to any other
goalie I've ever played with."
Hogan has little idea what made him the
fanatical goalie that he is today. But with-
out that unrelenting ambition to be a perfect
goaltender, he never would have established
himself as the starting goaltender last year
over record-setting netminder Billy Sauer.
It was a goalie controversy that under-
scored the Wolverines' entire season, one
where no goalie could safely be called No. 1.
BATTLING BETWEEN THE PIPES
Billy Sauer's junior campaign was some-
thing college goaltenders dream about.
Thirty wins. Four shutouts. A goals
against average (1.95) and save percentage
(.924) that are tops in Michigan history.
But the one pockmark on his resume is
what ultimately led to his fall from grace as
