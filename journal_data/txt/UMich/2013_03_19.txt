FACULY SENATE
Assembly elects
new members
to SACUA

School of Art
& Design gains
representation
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily Staff Reporter
On Monday, the Senate
Assembly elected Robert Ziff,
Laura Olsen and Anne Mondro
to serve three-year terms on the
Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs. The nine-
person committee meets weekly
to contribute a faculty voice to
discussions on University affairs
and policy.
Eight candidates from colleg-
es across the University ran for
positions. The election was hotly
contested. The three top vote-
getters earned seats on SACUA,
while the last seat came down
to a run-off ballot. Before the
balloting process, many of the
candidates spoke of their com-
mitment to tackling issues like
affordability and diversity, as
well as bridging the gap between
administration and faculty.
Martha Pollack, vice provost
for academic and budgetary
affairs - who will succeed cur-
rent Provost Phil Hanlon in May
- spoke after the election about
the importance of lessening an
"us vs. them" mentality between
the University's administration
and the general faculty.
"If we are not pulling togeth-

er, we are sunk," Pollack said. "I
hope we can all do something
about it."
Pollack added that "pulling
together" now was more impor-
tant than ever with numerous
challenges facing public higher
education.
Anne Mondro, an associate
professor in the School of Art &
Design, was elected to SACUA
with the most votes. She wrote in
her candidate statement that she
wanted to focus on supporting
the development of innovative
teaching methods and bringing
transparency to University poli-
cies.
"I am invested in learning as
much as possible about the Uni-
versity system and to educate
others and be a voice (in that pro-
cess)," Mondro said in an address
to the Senate Assembly.
Mondro added that she would
bring a unique voice to SACUA
because she comes from the art
school, which is not currently
represented on the committee,
bringing an understanding of
creative inquiry in education.
"I understand that there are
many modes of learning," Mon-
dro said. "I will support creative
inquiry and continue to encour-
age it to be used within in the
University as an important mode
of research."

Robert Ziff has worked for the
University for 32 years. He

Daily StaffReporters
Skyline High School senior
Javier Contreras has wanted
to be a Wolverine ever since he
can remember. After emigrating
with his parents from Mexico at
the age of four, he's been work-
ing hard to achieve what many
people come to the United States

hoping to find: a better life.
Fourteen years later, the next
step in achieving that goal is
being threatened because Con-
treras has had to make tuition
equality for many undocument-
ed immigrants a major factor in
choosing a college.
"It's frustrating because I've
worked really hard and people
don't understand why this isn't
an option for me," Contreras
said at a Coalition for Tuition
Equality rally Monday in front
of the Fleming Administration
Building. "If I got into Michi-
gan right now, I couldn't afford
it, especially because I can only
apply for private scholarships

and there aren't many of those."
The University faces a com-
plicated legal path to authoriz-
ing tuition equality - facing
a number of legal hurdles and
complications that could derail
the process or drag the Univer-
sity into costly lawsuits. How-
ever, Contreras said he "would
do whatever it took" to make
his dream a reality if policy was
changed.
Contreras applied to the Uni-
versity and is also considering
Western Michigan University
and Washtenaw Community
College because they charge in-
state rates for undocumented
Michigan residents. He now

has some documentation, but
won't be able to work or get in-
state tuition rates until he has a
green card or becomes a citizen,
something he doesn't foresee
happening.
"I have a good feeling some-
thing will change, whether it
be really big or small, but we've
been talking about reform for
so lon g, so I'll kind of believe it
when I see it," he said. "There
have been times when I feel like
all the work I've been doing isn't
really worth it, but as long as
there's a small vhsne of reform,
you have to be optipistic and
just hope for the best."

Diverse views
represented at
lengthy public
hearing
By FARONE E RASHEED
Daily StaffReporter
On Monday night, the Ann
Arbor City Council continued
discussions on a resolution that
would establish a moratorium
on site planning for the lot at 413
East Huron Street, deliberating
on a re-evaluation of the area's
current D1 zoning regulations
that allows for high-rise con-
struction.
An extensive public hearing
was held as numerous residents
approached the council to voice
opinions on the proposed site

plan.
Debate ranged from a desire
to protect surrounding residen-
tial neighborhoods to the need
to encourage and foster jobs cat-
alyzed by urban development.
Chief developers were pres-
ent to illustrate the evolution
of the project over the last nine
months. In light of claims that
they would be entitled to col-
lect damages from a potential
moratorium, neighbors coun-
tered with an impassioned plea
to stand up to the threats of liti-
gation.
A staff member from the Ann
Arbor Historic District Com-
mission noted that the group
was unanimous in supporting
the moratorium, citing Ann
Arbor City Code for Planning
and Development Issues, rules
on historical preservation.
Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1)

began council deliberations
and expressed a need to invoke
a moratorium to evaluate the
situation and address the needs
of the community.
"Most paramount to me is
that we actually look at the
downtown zoning," Briere said.
Stephen Kunselman (D-Ward
3) echoed similar sentiments,
notingthathe hadvoted against
the Ann Arbor Discovering
Downtown initiative, citing an
approach that he argued was
"too simplistic." He added that
the existing conditions allowing
commercial high-rise buildings
to be built alongside the resi-
dential community of the Old
4th Ward historic district was
a situation warranting correc-
tion.
"It just makes no sense from
an urban deaign pgrspective,"

A clam previously thought to

The species, Lasaea australis,

Learning by teaching others

Jeffrey Stanzler is the director
of the Interactive Communica-
tions and Simulations group in
the School of Education. Stanzler
earned his Master's degree at the
University and has been teaching
for 20 years.
What do you teach
at Michigan?
I teach educational technol-
ogy, and I also run a project that
does web-based simulations and
writing projects where college
students mentor middle-school,
high-school and, in some cases,
elementary-school students.
Where do students do

these type of projects?
My students do their work
wherever they choose to -
they're working with students
in actual classrooms around the
country and around the world,
so there's a password-protected
website where they're interact-
ing with their students.
What has been the best
thing you've learned while
working at the University?
It's important, if you can, to
retain your humility. Whether
you're older folks or younger
folks, we're always learning
and if you stay open to that, my

experience has been that life is
happier and more interesting
than if you figure that you've got
everything figured out.
Any advice for students?
I know in my class situa-
tions, students are a little more
reticent to ask questions. But,
I think in a bigger sense, the
willingness to ask questions
indicates that we have a natu-
ral curiosity. If we're not care-
ful, school can kind of squash
that curiosity, so I think that it's
important for people to honor
that curiosity and view it as a
strength and not a weakness.

Patriarch will visit new Pope

Police look for answers in crash

Eastern Orthodox
attendance at Papal
inauguration will be
the first in history
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Bar-
tholomew I, the spiritual leader
of the world's Orthodox Chris-
tians, will attend Pope Francis'
installation Mass - the first time
a patriarch from the Istanbul-
based church has attended a
papal investiture since the two
branches of Christianity split
nearly 1,000 years ago.
Bartholomew said he is doing
that to underscore the impor-
tance of "friendly ties" between
the churches and expectations
that the new pontiff will advance
rapprochement efforts that
began decades ago.
It's asentiment thatmanylead-
ers of other faiths are expressing
ahead of Tuesday's installation,
which is drawing dozens of Jew-

ish, Orthodox and other Chris-
tian leaders to Rome for the start
of a pontificate that is poised to
deepen the Vatican's ecumenical
and interfaith efforts given Fran-
cis' namesake and own history.
Those who knew Jorge Mario
Bergoglio as leader of Argentina's
Catholic Church say promoting
interfaith dialogue was at the
heart of his view of the what the
Catholic faith should be about -
an outward-reaching, bottom-up
effort to improve lives, no matter
what people's faith.
"He's the one who opened the
cathedral of Buenos Aires for
interfaith ceremonies, like when
we prayed for peace. He's not
one of those who waits for you to
call them to participate in these
events - he promotes them,"
Buenos Aires Rabbi Alejandro
Avruj told The Associated Press
on Monday.
Bergoglio brought Jewish,
evangelical Christian, Greek
Orthodox and Muslim leaders

into the Metropolitan Cathe-
dral to pray for peace in the
Middle East. Last November, he
welcomed Jews for a joint ser-
vice on the 74th anniversary of
Kristallnacht, the night in 1938
when nearly 200 synagogues
were destroyed, Jewish shops
were looted and tens of thou-
sands of Jews were sent to be
exterminated in Adolf Hitler's
Germany.
He also sponsored interfaith
prayers after Pope Benedict XVI
offended Muslims in 2006 by
quoting a Byzantine emperor
as saying some of the Prophet
Muhammad's teachings were
"evil and inhuman." Rather than
criticize Benedict directly, Ber-
goglio let a lower-ranking priest
lead that service and did not him-
self participate.
Bergoglio also shared happier
moments - such as lighting the
first candle in a Jewish Hanuk-
kah ceremony in December, his
latest interfaith act.

California police
hypothesize that
faulty steering wheel
caused race accident
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Authorities are investigating
whether a faulty steering wheel
caused a California raceway
crash that killed two people,
including the young cousin of
the teenage driver, officials said
Monday.
The Yuba County Sheriff's
Department is looking into wit-
ness reports that the detachable
steering wheel came off just
before 17-year-old Chase John-
son's car careened off the dirt
track and crashed into pit row
Saturday evening, Undersheriff
Jerry Read said.
"It's shaping up to look like a
mechanical failure, but there's
still work to be done," Read said
about the investigation.

Race car owner Dale Won-
dergem, 68, of Grass Valley and
Marcus Johnson, 14, of Santa
Rosa were killed by the collision
at Marysville Raceway Park,
about 40 miles north of Sacra-
mento, officials said.
The accident occurred
when Chase Johnson and sev-
eral other drivers were doing
warm-up laps on opening day
of the California Sprint Car
Civil War Series. No one else
was injured in the crash, and
spectators were never in jeop-
ardy, according to the sheriff's
department.
Marcus Johnson's father, Rob
Johnson, said his nephew Chase
told him the wheel detached
from the steering column as
he was heading into a corner
at about 90 mph, according to
KTVU-TV. The car hit a sloped
wall, launched into the air and
crashed about 150 feet from the
track, striking his son.
Johnson said the car was

brand new, so he believes some-
thing in the steering wheel's
quick-release mechanism failed.
"He had no control of the
car," Johnson told KTVU-TV. "I
don't know how it could come
off. He always double-checked
it just to make sure it was down
tight. He wasn't careless."
Rob Johnson, who lives in
Santa Rosa, said the two cousins
were close friends, and Marcus
had been helping Chase in the
pits during races for three years.
"The two of them were
just peas in a pod. They'd do
everything together and enjoy
every minute of life together,"
Johnson said. "He was one of
the sweetest boys you'll ever
know."
Friends and family gathered
at Marcus Johnson's Santa Rosa
middle school on Sunday eve-
ning, where they remembered
the 8th grader as a passionate
basketball player who loved rac-
ing cars.

CTE
From Page 1
Contreras' story was part of
a number of conversations on
tuition equality and access to
the University that took place on
Monday.
About 60 students from dif-
ferent CTE member organiza-
tions on campus gathered in front
of the Fleming Administration
Building on Monday, present-
ing letters and making speeches
to show their support for tuition
equality.
LSA senior Luz Meza stood out
in the rain for over an hour, shar-
ing the story of her path toward
U.S. citizenship.
"I've been very lucky and
worked very hard to get into
Michigan and everyone should
have that same opportunity, " she
said.
Meza has been involved with
several minority-rights groups on
campus since her freshman year,
and has been motivated by both
her peers and her past to continue
advocating.
She feels that their voices were
heard and is "optimistic" that
the administration will respond
favorably.
"I really trust that our admin-
istration really has a heart and
they care about this as much as I
do," Meza said. "I think that deep
inside, Mary Sue Coleman and
the regents do believe that we do
want these students here, and we
do want to give them that oppor-
tunity."
Meza said "politics" are pre-

The Medical School will
finance the project to carry out
architectural, mechanical and
electrical work. The renovation
will employ 72 on-site workers
and is slated for completion in fall
2015.
REGENTS TO APPROVE
NEW SOFTBALL FACILITY
The regents are set to review
the schematic design and revised
project budget for the Softball
Center New Facility project, as
requested by Athletic Director
David Brandon and Timothy Slot-
tow, the University's executive
vice president and chief financial
officer.
Approved at the October 2012
meeting, the project will include
new locker rooms for players
and coaches, new offices, fitness
spaces, hydrotherapy pools, a
team meetingroom and a support
space. With the regents' approv-
al, Integrated Architecture will
be responsible for the 10,200
gross-square-foot project.
The regents will consider the
revised project budget, which
has grown from $4 million to
$5.2 million as a result of Ath-
letic Department vresources and
gifts. After creating the schemat-
ic design, Brandon and Slottow

determined that they had origi-
nally underestimated the cost.
The project is set to provide
19 on-site construction jobs, and
construction is expected to be
completed in the winter of 2014.
REGENTS TO APPROVE
ISSUING OF SOUTH QUAD
RENOVATION BIDS,
As the schematic design for
the renovations to South Quad
was approved at the February
2013 regents meeting, the regents
are also set to authorize the issue
of bids and award construction
contracts for the project.
The $60-million project will
renovate nearly 106,700 square
feet of space in the first and
ground floors of the dorm. The
project will create an updated
and enlarged dining facili-
tymeant to be a hub for all of
Central Campus - similar to
Hill Dining Center - and reno-
vate bathrooms throughout the
building. The project will create
new spaces for student interac-
tion such as study spaces, music
practice rooms and refurbished
lounges.
The dorm's infrastructure
improvements include new
plumbing, fire detection and
suppression systems, wire-
less Internet and accessibility
improvements. There will be 131

served on SACUA last semester
as a substitute for Engineering
Prof. Rachel Goldman, who was
on sabbatical.
Ziff said he would focus on
defending tenure and academic
freedom. In his candidate state-
ment, he wrote about his interest
in confronting the challenges of
affordability and diversity at the
University, "in the face of declin-
ing federal support and a grow-
ing student body."

Ziff wants to increase the
voice faculty have concerning
University affairs and policy,
influence he said has diminished
over time.
Biology Prof. Laura Olsen said
her experience teaching in many
positions has given her a good
sense of the in-and-outs of the
University and an understand-
ing of the difficulty in balancing
teaching, research and scholar-
ship.
Olsen too wants to to increase
the relevance of faculty gover-
nance.l
"I believe that it is important

for all faculty voices tobe consid-
ered in decisions being made that
affect our outstanding faculty
and amazing student body as we
work to preserve and improve
our scholarship and academic
life," Olson said.
SACUA Chair Kimberlee
Kearfott, a professor of nuclear
engineering and radiological
science, said she was very satis-
fied with the results of the elec-
tion.
"Faculty governance won,"
Kearfott said. "We could not
have possibly lost with such a
fine slate of candidates."

The regents will also consider
roof reconstruction for the Earl

mated cost of $1.8 million funded
by investment proceeds.
In a communication with the
regents, Slottow said the cur-
rent roofing system has exceeded
its projected life and is showing
signs of wear. The project will
replace all existing roofing sys-
tems and walkway surfaces.
The project will create 18
on-site construction jobs and is
expected to be completed in the
fall of 2013.
TWITTER CEO AND SIX
OTHERS TO BE GRANTED
HONORARY DEGREES
While the University
announced Twitter CEO and
1985 alum Dick Costolo as the
spring commencement speaker
Monday, the regents will approve
him and six other honorary
degree recipients on Thursday.
In an interview with the Daily
on Sunday, Costolo, who will
receive a Doctor of Laws, said he
was surprised by the University's
choice of speaker.
"It's really the single great-
est honor I could ever imagine
receiving," Costolo said. "When I
grewup as askid outside of Detroit
in Troy, I always wanted to go to
Michigan. It was the only uni-
versity I applied to, and I always
knew I wanted to go there."
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said Costolo received
rave reviews for his November
address in Rackham Auditorium
and is excited to continue the
conversation this April in the Big
House.
"(Costolo's) entrepreneurial
drive, being at the leading edge
of a revolution in communica-
tion, and the impact of Twitter
on the world ... he deeply under-
stands the ways that this affects
people's interactions with each
other," Coleman said.
Pending Thursday's approval,
six others will receive honorary
degrees in April.
William Brehm, a University
alum and philanthropist, will
receive a Doctor of Laws. He is
the co-founder and chair of SRA
International, a consulting firm
focused on national security.
In addition to this work, which
included a stint in the 1960s and
1970s with the Department of
Defense, Brehm has made sub-
stantial contributions to the Uni-
versity, including an $8 million
donation to renovate the Earl V.
Moore building at the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance.
Ballerina and educator
Suzanne Farrell will receive
a Doctor of Fine Arts. After
achieving her status at the fore-
front of ballet, Farrell formed
her own dance company which is

Online learning, to a degree
Michigan should give college credit for MOOC completion
n Wednesday, California state senators proposed a new bill
that requires the state's 145 public colleges and universities
to grant credit for completing massive open online courses,
called MOOCs. The preposed mandate on online credit reflects a
necessary shift in higher education, allowing for easy and affordable
access to courses for many students. This legislation will propel the
conversation about online courses forward, and with any luck should
prompt other states to adopt similar policies. Michigan should con-
sider similar legislation to ensure that students who pass MOOCs,
such as Udacity and Coursera, obtain credit toward their degree.

The bill would create a system in which stu-
dents can access courses virtually and receive
credit at the University of California, Califor-
nia State University and California Communi-
ty College campuses. A nine-member faculty
council, composed of three faculty members
selected by each system's Academic Senate,
would decide which courses can be taken for
credit. They'll also decide logistics such as
prerequisites, instructional support and text-
book accessibility. The bill will help allow
students to bypass California's overcrowded
classrooms and lower the price tag attached
to a college education by giving credit for
MOOCs, which are often free to take.
This mandate propels the future of MOOCs
and other online education resources as a
legitimate option in higher education. Taught
by professors at top universities, these online
classes allow for more flexibility and options
for affordable instruction. Furthermore,
these courses allow students to enroll in inex-
pensive classes over the summer - an attrac-
tive option for those looking to lighten their
load during the school year or are ineligible
for financial aid over the spring and summer
terms. Currently, MOOCs don't necessar-
ily offer any credit incentive, but a bill that
requires universities and colleges to grant

credit would ensure that students' effort
helps them toward a degree instead of just
for knowledge's sake. The bill also offers con-
tent from the California Digital Open Source
Library, where students can obtain free or
cheap textbooks.
However, there are certain guidelines that
need to be considered when granting college
credit. When receiving credit for online cours-
es, there should be a set credit limit a student
can transfer. This system. would be similar to
when a student wants to transfer credit from
a community college or four-year university
to another school. Additionally, the bill does
create a faculty council that decides which
courses that are a part of the system, and
they should ensure that well-qualified profes-
sors from accredited universities and colleges
teach the courses.
Not only do MOOCs and other online educa-
tion tools allow easier access and affordability,
but they also give students more time to take
advantage of a liberal arts education. Students
using MOOCs for required courses would have
time to explore other interests. California's
legislature has actualized the conversation
about MOOCs and various other online tools,
andnow it's time for Michigan to start moving
toward the future of online learning as well.

We're caught in the midst
of an obesity epidemic.
One-third of Ameri-
can adults are
considered
overweight;
another third is
clinically obese.
Michigan is
frequently cited
as one of the
fattest states in
the nation, with JENNIFER
an adult obese XU
population that
teeters past the
30-percent mark. Obese people live
shorter lifespans, and their quality
of life is decreased by diseases such
as diabetes, hypertension, stroke
and cancer.
Exhortations to improve nutri-
tion and increase physical activity
have only made a dent in the under-
lying issue. As any dieter can tell
you, it's not so easy to shed the extra
pounds once they're packed tight
on the belly. Try as we might to eat
more greens and hit the treadmill,
our bodies appear to have a tightly
regulated set point: If we deviate
from the norm, we just gain the
weight back later.
what's more, overly aggressive
governmental efforts to curb the
obesity problem have drawn ire
from social activists. Advertise-
ments depicting children loading
shopping carts with processed
foods were denounced as discrimi-
natory and ineffective. "There is
nothing that anyone is going to do
or say that's going to make fat peo-
ple skinny tomorrow," said Jezebel

writer Lindy West.
But what if there was something
we could do? What if the answer to
the obesity epidemic lay in a Japa-
nese asthma and canker sore drug
from the 1980s?
Researchers at the University
have found that the off-patent drug
Amlexanox, originally developed as
a topical paste for canker sores and
a tablet for asthma by the Takeda
Pharmaceutical Company in 1987,
is effective in reducing fat deposits
and type-2 diabetes in obese mice.
The study, headed by Alan Saltiel,
the Mary Sue Coleman Direc-
tor of the Life Sciences Institute,
discovered that populations of
genetically obese mice and mice
on a high-fat diet lost significant
amounts of weight after being treat-
ed with this Japanese asthma drug.
The drug also caused obese mice to
have improved glucose tolerance - a
sign of decreased diabetic effects on
their metabolism - and produced
less fatty tissue in their livers.
Most significantly, the drug
didn't reduce the animals' food
intake. That's right: the obese mice
bulked down considerably - even
while they continued to gorge
themselves on food.
Why? The researchers think it has
something to do with metabolism.
Though the Amlexanox-injected
mice didn't stop overeating, they
were much more active than those
not exposed. Normally, the fatter
you are, the less you move, and if
you restrict calories, you're likely to
move even less. That's because our
brains have a tricky way of regulat-
ing body weight: cut calories, and

the body will respond by slowing
down metabolism. It's a key reason
why it's so difficult to lose weight
even after diet restriction. But
the Amlexanox-treated mice had
metabolisms comparable to those
mice of a much lower weight, dissi-
pating the extra energy in their fat
cells as heat.
Can a canker sore
drug solve the
obesity problem?
Obviously, mice are not people,
so researchers can't draw strong
conclusions about the drug's effec-
tiveness on obese patients. But the
benefit of using Amlexanox is that
we already know it's safe - it's been
used in Japan to treat canker sores
and asthma for the past 25 years.
Researchers can begin clinical tri-
als immediately, without the usual
rigmarole involved in getting a
drug approved for human studies.
The sequestration - a govern-
mental cut that slashed National
Institutes of Health's $31-billion
budget by $1.5 billion - couldn't
come at a more inopportune time.
It's frustrating to know that,
though the pieces to combating the
obesity epidemic are in front of us,
the receptacle holding the money is
pe'rpetually shrinking.

Regulations, across the (bill)board

Get active, not pretentious

Everything is relative. Sometimes we're so
distracted by certain things that we assume
they're the only cause of an issue - even
a major issue. Take distracted driving, for
example. When I mention distracted driv-
ing, the first thing you probably think of is
someone talking or texting on his or her cell
phone. Or maybe you think of someone try-
ing to apply makeup in heavy traffic. You
might even see someone reading a book on
the way to work. But something fails to cross
our minds: the enormous and ever-present
use of billboards on every stretch of highway
in Michigan.
Lately, laws such as Kelsey's Law, signed
by Gov. Rick Snyder on Jan. 8, target student
drivers with a level one or two graduated
license. The law bans cell phone use by people
of this age group with the intent of keeping
young drivers safe and undistracted. Studies
from the University of Utah have shown that
using a cell phone while driving -hands-free
or not - is equivalent to the driver having a
blood alcohol concentration at the legal limit
of .08 percent. With the rise of cell-phone
use, more attention has been given to stop-
ping people from using their phones on the
road. While these new initiatives are impor-
tant, the government refuses to look at other
highly dangerous road distractions.
On a recent drive across Michigan, I noticed
countless billboards with flashing lights, three-
dimensional items and larger-than-life images.
The sole purpose of billboards? To distract the
driver. On the highway late at night, all it takes
is a split-second glance at a billboard - a lawyer
smiling oily, his phone number plastered below
- and you've suddenly veered out of your lane,
causing an accident.

It's simply not fair that the government is
cracking down on citizens for driving while
making a business call (which is admittedly
dangerous) but allow billboards to get big-
ger and bigger. I don't remember seeing such
extensive, fancy and distracting billboards
when I was younger. The distractions are only
getting worse as the technology to grab the
driver's attention gets better.
The reason the companies get away with
it and the individual citizens using their cell
phones don't is because the set-up of our soci-
ety promotes the unlimited freedom of the
advertising companies. The government has
little to no interest in stopping the advertisers
from doing whatever they want. Multi-million
dollar corporations exemplify this statement
in everything they do from polluting the earth
to sponsoring obnoxious billboards for revenue
purposes. Our society promotes doing what-
ever is necessary to get ahead and make the
most money. If that means distracting drivers
to promote a product and putting people's lives
in danger, these companies will do it. The prob-
lem is that our government isn't checking the
advertisers' actions.
We cannot ask companies to stop putting up
billboards. Some of them are innocuous enough
to ignore and businesses big and small use
them. But it's the principle of the matter. Why
is it fair for billboards to exist to entertain and
distract us while we have to put our cell phones
away? The government needs to take a closer
look at what distracts drivers. If they make laws
prohibiting distracting activities, especially
targeting students, they must follow this action
across the board.

Turn off the lights. Use reus-
able water bottles. Skip the
tray.
With all these
orders, the
environmental
movement starts
to soundalot like
a nagging moth-
er (sorry Mom,
but it's true!).
Even so, I try my ZOE
best to listen - I STAHL
obsessively turn
off the lights
around my apartment to save ener-
gy, I lug my water bottle around to
avoid adding plastic to ever-growing
landfills and I've learned to balance
plates and cups and bowls like a
waitress. All this so that there's one
less tray to wash and, hopefully, a
little less food waste, too.
Even though I care deeply about
the environment and am commit-
ted to creating a more sustainable
future, I must admit that I'm sick
of it. All those reminders put the
onus on the individual. You have
to spend your time, your energy
and sometimes even your money
to make the sustainable choice in
a fundamentally unsustainable
system. And you know what? Not
everyone can, knows how to or
even cares to do so.
So, I'm looking at you, kid - you
who also cares about the environ-
ment and totes a reusable bag. Maybe
you've even worked on an organic
farm or volunteered with Natural
Resources Defense Council one sum-
mer. I know how you feel. I feel ittoo.

I'm frustrated by what sometimes
seems like a lack of concern for envi-
ronmental issues and, even more, by
a lack ofurgency to address them.
But you know what I find equally
worrying? How self-righteous and
self-satisfied (and not to mention,
insular) we environmentalists can
sometimes be. If you're anythinglike
me, you can't help but feel the slight-
est bit proud as you sip out of your
Camelbak while fellow Wolverines
drink out of a disposable bottle.
And though it sounds like I'm
dripping with disdain for the envi-
ronmental movement and its adher-
ents, I commend them, really. I just
have a suggestion: We should sac-
rifice some of the satisfaction we
derive from these personal acts of
sustainability and start advocating
for structural changes that promote
an even more environmentally con-
scious university.
So, how about instead of your
weekly Saturday trip to the Farm-
ers' Market, you attend a Student
Sustainability Initiative roundtable
meeting and get involved in efforts
to make the Big House a zero-waste
facility? Don't get me wrong, sea-
sonal produce is certainly a step
in the sustainable direction, but
it's ultimately a small, individual-
ized drop in the reusable bucket. By
helping to make systemic changes,
you'll ultimately have a greater
effect on the environment and the
University itself.
Maybe you think the Univbersity
should stop installing air condition-
ers in newly built residence halls in
order to preserve energy. Or maybe

you would like to see the University
use organic fertilizers for all of the
campus greenery so we can prevent
soil erosion and toxic run-off while
simultaneously lowering costs.
Write the Office of Campus Sustain-
ability or the Graham Institute of
Sustainability an e-mail. Pen a let-
ter to University President Mary Sue
Coleman while you're at it.
I care about the
environment - but I'm
sick of the movement.
"The University is too big," you
say? "I'm only one person." "They
won't listen." "I don't have enough
time." "Michigan is so bureaucrat-
ic." Maybe, but what isn't bureau-
cratic these days? Where does it
seem easy to make a change? If you
put in the time and effort, good
things will happen.
You might argue that I'm now
placing the burden on you again.
And you know what? To some
degree, I am. But at the very least
you'd be using your time and energy
to create a more sustainable system
that will ease and facilitate more
environmentally friendly behavior,
benefiting all.
But hey, don't forget to still turn
off those lights.

the chaos of total war to single

follows the series's epic story of
love, loss, betrayal and intrigue.
Players control Sarah Kerrigan

of nightmarish extraterrestrial
monsters - the Zerg - to exact
justice on the people of the Ter-

reunite every faction of the Zerg
into her hate-fueled regime.

The 27-mission, single-player
storyline is expertly crafted,
with excitement at every turn.
Players find themselves con-
fronting threats, both new and
ancient, and have to use every
weapon in Kerrigan's arsenal to

TREY
From Page 8
XA ad turnover by Trey makes the group groan
andlook down at their food, even with Michi-
an holding a comfortable 10-point lead.
Benji starts to say something about the play but
stops midway through the word "can't." Instead of
finishing the thought, he claps his hands and drowns
the criticism with a sip of water.
Before Trey started his Michigan career, his rela-
tionship with Benji felt more like a coach and a player.
They were close in physical proximitybutdidn'thave
a deep relationship.
Brian Snow, a recruiting analyst for Scout.com,
still remembers shouting matches between the two
during games, Trey on the court and Benji on the
bench. Sometimes Trey wouldn't even speak to his
father after games..
He could've played the best game of his AAU
career, and Benji still would've had something to pick
apart. Praise only came when Benji was talking to
other people. Trey never heard any of it.
"When it was just me and him talking, he was so
- I don't want to say negative - but he had so much
constructive criticism towards me," Trey said. "He
would always tell me what I needed to work on or
what I didn't do right. It was always something."
In the summer before his senior year, Trey vis-
ited Michigan three times before committing, even
though his mind was pretty much set on Cincinnati.
But Benji pushed for Ann Arbor, painting a picture
in the weeks before Trey made his decision. The kid
was 17 years old and didn't see the things his dad did
about Michigan.
The two walked around Ann Arbor, talking about
the education, the opportunity to play right away and
the $23-million projectto renovate the Crisler Center.
Benji wanted Trey at Michigan, but he knew his
son wouldn't take strong advice from his old coach.
He let Trey come to his own conclusions, not trying
to convince him of anything.
Trey had to see Benji as his dad, and Benji had to
learn that he wanted tobe a father that coached, not a
coach that's also a father.
"We're way closer now," Trey said. "We used to be
close because we were around each other every sin-
gle day, but we didn't have the relationship we need-
ed to have away from the court. I felt like there was
certain things I couldn't talk to him about because he
was a coach and a dad.
"It was hurting our relationship off the court. Life
isn't just about basketball."
Benji and Ronda picked Trey up in April 2012,
his dorm room already almost packed, trash
bags full of clothes on the floor. Michigan
coach John Beilein and the staff had decided to give
him a weekend off to go home and relax. It took his
parents less than 20 minutes to start talking about
the year ahead and the hardest decision he would
ever have to make.
Earlier that week, Jeff Goodman, a senior college
basketball writer for CBS Sports, reported that Trey
was expected to leave Michigan for the NBA. It was
assumed he was gone, a one-year flash of maize and
blue, albeit a flash with one of the best freshman sea-
sons at Michigan in recent memory.
Trey, the Big Ten Freshman of the Year, slumped
down in the back seat of his parents' car and talked
about the future, just needing to go home. He had

seems to have relaxed the bar.
Rhodman has had Benji's ear the whole game, the
one guy who can break the stare from the table to the
TV. As he did in high school, Rhodman trained with
Trey lastsummer. He's the man tasked with channel-
ing that tireless work ethic into something produc-
tive.
Rhodman had to focus the energy of the kid who
was relegated to watching his dad and his friends
play on the courts without him, but worked on drib-
bling with his off hand instead of pouting.
"I told myself, 'Man, if you are coming back to
school, you can't have any regrets,' "Trey said. "'You
have to go at it two, three times harderthan you went
after it last year."'
Teammate Corey Person, a fifth-year senior guard
and the old man of the squad, said that Trey "was
going crazy working out over the summer," visiting
the gym at least two-to-three times a day.
"I thinksome of the best players in the country are
the guys who weren't ranked high and people didn't
kiss their butts when they were younger and coming
up," Goodman said. "They had to work for every-
thing, and that gives you a mentality a lot of these
other guys don't have."
Trey's sophomore year has gone about as well as
it could go. He was named the Big Ten Player of the
Year - the first Wolverine to win that award in 24
years - and is on the short list for several Player of
the Year Awards.
"This second year has helped me so much," Trey
said. "It allowed me to grow up. Last year, Iwas look-
ing to go to the NBA just because I was so shocked.
I actually had the chance to go to the NBA - that's
been my dream since I was young.
"I think that was just so thrilling to me, just that I
had the chance to go. I tested it out, but comingback
this year has helped me to grow so much."
Averaging more than 19 points and almost seven
assists a game, Trey was .2 assists per game away
from joining Magic Johnson in that 17-and-7 club. He
scored at least 15 points in every Big Ten game this
season and led the nation with a stellar 3.5 assist-
to-turnover ratio. From last season to this one, Trey
improved both his field-goal and 3-point percentages
by more than .5 percentage points.
The men at the bar groan when backup point
guard Spike Albrecht enters the game, because Trey
is effectively the only Wolverine who can drive and
get into the paint.
Michigan's offense runs through Trey's ability to
create for everyone else on the floor, and when he
isn't in the game or isn't playing his best basketball,
point production stalls.
"If we have a point guard in the future that does
80 percent of what he does, we'll always have a good
team," Beilein said. "You need to have a young man
that really sees the game at the pace he does. To doit
like he does is exceptional."

Burke is a potential first-round NBA draft pick if he decides to forego his final two years at Michigan.

The lead has disappeared, and the bar is get-

now-tied game, Benji stands up to watch. He
won't sit back down until the game is over, until he
has walked over to the side of the bar, away from the
group, to call Ronda and talk about Michigan's 84-78
loss to the Nittany Lions.
As the game winds down, Benji starts acting out
plays and maneuvers, using barstools and his friends
as imaginary defenders.
With the Wolverines down three, Trey makes two
free throws to get Michigan to within one. Those
would be Michigan's last points of

Recipe for CCHA
run: defense, with
hint of confidence

Freshman forward Kelsey Mitchell fills out her bracket on Selection Monday, which ended with Michigan landing its second consecutive NCAA Tournament berth.
earns its best A seed
ever and wi meet illanova

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan hockey team's
current miracle run through
the CCHA Tournament might
appear like it has come out of
nowhere, but Michigan coach
Red Berenson has seen the Wol-
verines' resurgence coming for a
while.
It all goes back to Michigan's
series against Notre Dame in
February in which the Wol-
verines were outscored 13-8.
Though the Fighting Irish blew
Michigan out of the water, that
was the moment Berenson real-
ized the then-floundering squad
was finallyturningit around.
"We scored eight (goals) and
our power play scored three,"
Berenson said. "We did a lot
of good things. I could see our
team playing better but not good
enough. I think there was some-
thing going on. We weren't that
far off. We just needed to put a
full game together."
Michigan has gone undefeated
since that weekend, riding high
on momentum to its 24th con-
secutive trip to Joe Louis Arena
for the CCHA semifinals.
Junior forward Luke Moffatt
saw the turnaround coming long
before the Notre Dame weekend
- he says it goes all the wayback
to a Dec. 15 victory over West-
ern Michigan. But even though
that 2-0 shutout was the best the
Wolverines had played up to that
point, team chemistry wasn't
quite where it needed to be to
translate into more wins.
"It really just took us longer
than usual this year to come
together," Moffatt said. "We're
just playing more as a team, as a
unit now. Everyone's buying into
the system."
It's certainly easier to main-
tain a positive mentality with a
winningstreak.
At this point, there aren't
many on-ice aspects of the game

that Michigan needs to perfect.
Goaltending is no longer a ques-
tion mark now that freshman
Steve Racine has stepped up
and the defense is finally block-
ing pucks to protect the crease.
All that remains is carrying the
heightened confidence through
Joe Louis Arena - a mentality
that is perhaps the keyto success.
"The big part of the game,
every player will tell you, is men-
tal," Berenson said. "So, what has
changed? It's obviously on the
ice. Part of it might be off-the-
ice determination, frustration or
motivation. That's sports."
All season long, Berenson has
looked to the upperclassmen
- such as senior captains A.J.
Treais or Lee Moffie - to guide
the Wolverines through their
rough patches. But that proved
difficult considering the seniors
themselves were also struggling
to improve individually.
Now, though, Michigan's lead-
ership has worked outthe blipsin
its game and it has started setting
better examples on the ice. That
work ethic has quickly become
contagious.
"You've got to do (work) on
the ice before you're going to get
legitimate confidence," Berenson
said. "Sometimes if you're not
doing it, you see someone else
doing it and that gets you going.
That's what leadership is all
about."
Berenson said he's coached
teams that he never thought
would win another game into
squads he never thought could
lose another game. Right now, he
believes this year's edition of the
Wolverines might shape out the
same way.
The players are starting to see
that, too.
"We're really having a ton
more fun now," Moffatt said.
"Not just because of the success,
but because of the way we're
playing. We're playing for each
other and for the team."

Committee seeds
Wolverines eighth
in Spokane Region
0 along with Stanford
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
Whatadifference ayear makes.
Last year, the Michigan wom-
en's basketball team entered
Selection Monday unsure of its
fate. This year, the Wolverines
knew they were a lock to dance -
the only uncertainty was whom
they would face.
They didn't have to wait long to
find out.
Less than three minutes into
the ESPN telecast, Michigan (9-7
Big Ten, 21-10 overall) learned
its fate and was awarded an eight
seed in the Spokane Region, tying
a record for the highest seed in
program history. The Wolverines
will face ninth-seeded Villanova
(9-7 Big East, 21-10 overall) on
Sunday at 7:30 p.m. EDT in Palo
Alto, Calif.
"I think that's the earliest I've
ever had a call going to the NCAA
Tournament," said Michigan
coach Kim Barnes Arico. "But
now we know, and we are ready to
face (Villanova)."
The Wildcats finished sixth in
the Big East, a conference Barnes
Arico knows well from her time at
St. John's - she led the Red Storm
to the Sweet Sixteen last season.
In addition, Barnes Arico's St.
John's team beat Villanova three
times in a row, and her last loss to

the Wildcats came in 2009.
"I know a lot about (Villa-
nova)," Barnes Arico said. "Actu-
ally, I just saw a tweet that coach
Beilein was talking more about
the women's game than the men's
game because he's really good
friends with (Villanova coach)
Harry Perretta, too."
Added senior forward Kate
Thompson: "I think Coach com-
ing from the Big East will be an
advantage. She knows how they
play (and) she knows all their
styles. Definitely having coach
Barnes Arico is going to have us
prepared."
But the Wolverines haven't
seen the court in 10 days and still
have five days to go until they play
again. This time off will either be
a blessing or a curse for Michigan,
whose longest gap in games this
season was seven days.
In its game against Wiscon-
sin after the bye week, Michigan
looked sluggish, letting the Bad-
gers rush out to an early 9-0 lead.
The Wolverines were able to claw
back at the end but probably can-
not afford to start slowly in the
tournament.
Michigan has had a season of
streaks this year, but with more
than two weeks off, the Wolver-
ines have the opportunity to start
fresh in the best place to get hot -
the NCAA Tournament. The time
might be a blessing for a team
that has found most of its success
from its starting lineup but has
received little bench production.
"I think the time off actually
benefits us because we play such a
limitedbench," Barnes Arico said.
"I think it gives the kids that play

a lot of time to rest and recover.
(Senior guard) Jenny (Ryan)
played a tremendous amount of
minutes all season long. It gives
her a chance to rest and regroup
and refocus for the tournament.
It's a whole other season for us."
Ryan, who earned third-team
All-Big Ten honors for the first
time in her career, led the team in
minutes, averaging36.9 per game.
Toward the end of the season, she
was often on the court for all 40
minutes, and her fatigue began to
show.
"I think having some time off is
not the worst thing in the world,"
Ryan said. "It gives us a chance
to recuperate, get (our) legs back
under (us) and (time to) work on

ourselves, because during the sea-
son you go from team to team, so
I think it will be good for us espe-
cially offensively.
"I think we'll be fresh. Have
fresh bodies (and) fresh legs. We
look at (the tournament) as a new
season, and I think we'll be ready
to go from there."
A potential second-round
matchup with No. 1 seed Stanford
looms, so a well-rested Michigan
can't get ahead of itself.
"The next couple days is going
to be all Villanova," said senior
center Rachel Sheffer. "Just like
the Big Ten tournament, you play
back-to-back games, so all that
really matters is the next game,
and that's Villanova."

COLUMBUS -
Benji Burke peeks over his
menu, trying to order his din-
ner and watch the television
at the same time. There's a waitress
next to him, leaning in while waiting
to take his order.
Benji doesn't order until, up on
the screen, the basketball goes out of
bounds, and even then, it's a 10-sec-
ond conversation without eye con-
tact.
When the food arrives, Benji's eyes
still almost never leave the screen.
He talks to friends without looking at
them, occasionally glancing down at
his phone duringcommercial breaks.
Up on the TV is his only son, Trey,
who is playing basketball for Michi-
gan in State College, Pa.
The Wolverines are playing Penn
q State, ateam that doesn't have a
conference win. This shouldn't
be much of a contest, yet
Benji's right leg doesn't
stop twitching and won't
stop twitching until the
end of the game.
Benji's got his sup-
port system here at a
local bar in Colum-
bus. It's a group of
10 men, all of whom
are former Ohio State
fans and almost all of
whom have known
Trey since he was born.
Most are still wearing
red. One, Alonzo Shav-
ers, even played foot-
ball for the Buckeyes.
Yet none of them
miss a Michigan bas-
ketball game. Even
the women at the
salon where Benji
gets his hair cut
plan their weeks
around Michigan's
schedule.
At a venue full
of Buckeye jerseys,
posters and memo-
rabilia, the major-
ity of the TVs are
tuned into the
Michigan basket-
ball game, which
starts with an
assist from Trey.
To everyone but
Benji, Trey is Michi-
gan's star sophomore,
the best point guard
and one of the best over-
all players in the country.
He's the most important player
on a Michigan squad that is widely
considered to be a fringe top-20 team
without him.
But to Benji, Trey is his project
and his lineage, a lifeline to a game he
loves more than just about anything
and a growing reminder of what it
means to raise a son and not his for-
mer player.
And for the first time since Benji
coached Trey in basketball - which
he did for most of his son's life in AAU
- their relationship has settled.
P enn State getsafouled on amade
layup, and a waiter walking by
lets out a first pump and an
"and-1!" call. The entire group stands
up, telling the waiter he needs to be
somewhere else.
That waiter doesn't return to the
table.
Everything Trey does gets a reac-
tion. If he has a nice assist, one of
them shouts out that he taught the
kid that move. If Trey has a turnover,

the men blame Benji and his coach-
ing. Nothing goes unnoticed, nothing
goes without a comment.
The men yell out, "What's the
count" every couple minutes during
the game, but the count isn't the score
of the game, or even Trey's point total
- they're counting his assists.
At this point, Trey's averaging 6.9

per game on the season, but they want
him to get eight against Penn State. If
he averages eight over the last four
games of the season, it'll put him in
the same company as former Michi-
gan State great Magic Johnson, who
is the only Big Ten player to average
17 points andsevenassistsin aseason.
They want to see his name next to
Magic's, even if it says Michigan and
not Ohio State next to Burke.
Trey's relationship with this rau-
cous, competitive group of men start- 0
ed when Benji began bringing his son
to the Nelson Recreational Center
gym when Trey was just learning
how to walk. Trey was dominating in
his first organized league by the time
he was 5.
Still, nothing compared to those
weekends at Nelson.
Walking around the gym,he would
dribble with both hands, focusing on
his left, trying to impress the older
guys playing the real games on the
court. He can still vividly remember
standing on the sidelines, dribbling
with his off hand, waiting for his
chance. Trey would beg to play with
them, to no avail.
After the games, the group hung
out in the parking lot, a once-a-week
reunion of sorts. Trey would still be
dribbling, still working on, his off-
hand, trying to get his dsd's friend
O.J. to play a game of keep-away with
him.
With no rims in sight, just the
asphalt of the parking lot, O.J. would
take the bait and try and take the ball.
He would get the steal almost every
time, but once or twice every week-
end, Trey would get him to bite on a
crossover and leave him behind.
The men would whoop and hol-
ler because while they might have
owned the gym, for a couple of fleet-
ing moments once a week, the kid
owned the parking lot. In those
moments, he felt like he was one of
the guys, not just the runt who had to
sit out and watch them play while he
dribbled.
It would make Trey's day, until the
group would go back to the Burke's
and hang out in the basement, where
Trey was left out from playing cards
and even his own video games.
The men were never mean on pur-
pose, but they were hard on the young
boy. It makes Trey laugh now, but
back then, sometimes he wondered if
they merely tolerated him instead of
likinghim.
Sometimes Benji felt guilty know-
ing his group was too harsh with
Trey, and that maybe even he was
too hard on his son. But every week-
end, there was Trey, still trying to tag
along at the gym and be with the guys.
He couldn't tell Trey not to come, and
he couldn't tell his friends to not be
themselves. He still remembers how
that felt, the line of tension between
his son and group of friends.
"I think they were hard on me
because they knew it would help me
grow into the person I am today,"
Trey said. "It was fun growing up
around my dad and all his friends
because they allowed me to grow up
quicker than I would have if I wasn't
around them."
Now the men are back at the bar,
planning their nights around watch-
ing Trey's game from the sideline1
A few weeks ago, Trey watched
a family video of a kid, prob-
bly 3 or 4years old, throwing
a legendary fit after being tagged "it"
in a game of duck-duck-goose.
Trey couldn't believe he was

watching himself; he thought he was
watchingsomebody else.
Trey's better at concealing his
emotions now. The stage is bigger, the
consequences are greater. Still, inside
his 20-year-old body is that same
little kid who couldn't stand losing at
duck-duck-goose.
